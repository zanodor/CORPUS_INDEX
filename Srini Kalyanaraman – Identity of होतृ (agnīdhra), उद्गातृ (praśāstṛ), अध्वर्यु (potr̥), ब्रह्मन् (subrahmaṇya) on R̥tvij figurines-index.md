# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Identity of होतृ (agnīdhra), उद्गातृ (praśāstṛ), अध्वर्यु (potr̥), ब्रह्मन् (subrahmaṇya) on R̥tvij figurines.pdf

Identity of होतृ (agnīdhra), उद्गातृ (praśāstṛ), अयुध्वर्
(pot ̥r), ब्रह्मन् (subrahmaṇya) on R̥ tvij figurines
R̥ tvij figurines are archaeologically attested in finds of Dholavira, Mohenjo-daro, Shahr-iSokhta, Mundigak.
The identity of four Ṛtvij (ऋत्विज् ) (k) priests performing yajña is gleaned from the types of head-bands worn by them, as seen on figurines obtained archaeologically from Dholavira, Mohenjo-daro, Shahr-i-Sokhta and Mundigak. The Dholavira sculptural fragement does NOT show the head band but shows the figurine seated in a posture uniquely attributed to Ṛtvij. That these figurines were made is an indicator of the eminent position held by the performers of a yajña.
Ṛtvij (ऋत्विज्) are vipra 'sage' or kavi 'seer'.
All Ṛtvij wear fillets or headbands, signifiers of successful performance of yajña and investiture ceremony of the R̥ tvij who performed the yajña.
All Ṛtvij are shown in figurines in unique seated postures. Variations in shapes and hypertexts on the headbands or gold fillets worn on their foreheads (attested archaeologically) signify unique functions performed by the four Ṛtvij (ऋत्विज्).
Type 1 होतृ (agnīdhra)
Type 2 उद्गातृ (praśāstṛ) udgīta, division of the Sāmaveda chanted in Vedic ritual by the उद्गातृ (praśāstṛ)
Type 3 ह्मब्रन् (subrahmaṇya) signifier of कण्ठालः kaṇṭhālaḥ 'maritime, boat'
Type 4 अयुर्ध्व (pot ̥r) Detailed identification in

[quote]hotṛ as the presiding priest, with perhaps only the adhvaryu as his assistant in the earliest times. The phrase "seven hotars" is found more than once in the Rigveda. Hymn 2.1.1, 2 of Rigveda states it as follows,
िमेग्न द् यर्भिस्त्वमाशयशयक्षभिस्त्वमद्भ्यस्त्वमश्मनस्परि । िं वनेभ्यस्त्वमोषधींभ्यस्त्व नृिां नृपते जार्से शयभ ः ॥१॥ RV 2.1.1
THOU, Agni, shining in thy glory through the days, art brought to life from out the waters, from the stone: From out the forest trees and herbs that grow on ground, thou, Sovran Lord of men art generated pure.
तवाेग्न होंत्र तव पोत्रमृत्विंर् तव नेष्ट् र ं िमभदृग्नतार्तः ।
व प्रशांस्त्र िमध्विीर्भस ब्रह्म ाभस गृहपभतश्च नो दमे ॥२॥ RV 2.1.2
Thine is the Herald's task and Cleanser's duly timed; Leader art thou, and Kindler for the pious man. Thou art Director, thou the ministering Priest: thou art the Brahman, Lord and Master in our home.
— Rigveda 2.1.2
The head-band worn by Shahr-i-Sokhta priest may signify him to be Brahman R̥ tvij who is the head-priest.
The above hymn enumerate the priests as the hotṛ, potṛ, neṣṭṛ, agnīdh, praśāstṛ (meaning the maitrāvaruna) and adhvaryu.
• The hotṛi was the reciter of invocations and litanies. These could consist of single verses (ṛca), strophes (triples called tṛca or pairs called pragātha), or entire hymns (sukta),

drawn from the ṛgveda. As each phase of the ritual required an invocation, the hotṛi had a leading or presiding role. • The adhvaryu was in charge of the physical details of the sacrifice (in particular the adhvara, a term for the Somayajna). According to Monier-Williams, the adhvaryu "had to measure the ground, to build the altar, to prepare the sacrificial vessels, to fetch wood and water, to light the fire, to bring the animal and immolate it," among other duties. Each action was accompanied by supplicative or benedictive formulas (yajus), drawn from the yajurveda. Over time, the role of the adhvaryu grew in importance, and many verses of the ṛgveda were incorporated, either intact or adapted, into the texts of the yajurveda. • The udgātṛi was a chanter of hymns set to melodies (sāman) drawn from the sāmaveda. This was a specialized role in the major soma sacrifices: a characteristic function of the udgātṛ was to sing hymns in praise of the invigorating properties of soma pavamāna, the freshly pressed juice of the soma plant. • The brahman was the reciter of hymns from the atharvaveda who was largely silent and observes the procedures and uses Atharvaveda mantras to 'heal' it when mistakes have been made.
The term Brahman in the above hymn 2.1.2 refers to deity Agni of hymn 2.1.1.
The rgvedic Brahmanas, Aitareya and Kausitaki, specify seven hotrakas to recite shastras
(litanies): hotṛ, brāhmanācchamsin, maitrāvaruna, potṛ, neṣṭṛ, agnīdh and acchāvāka. They also carry a legend to explain the origin of the offices of the subrahmaṇya and the grāvastut.[unquote]
Four types of headbands are archaeologically attested; twelve seals were discovered from one house of Mohenjo-daro togthr with a figurine of a 'priest' -- a seated man wearing a cloak over the left shoulder. See: https://tinyurl.com/yckks3sv
Double-storeyed building, Mohenjo-daro where a cluster of seals were found.

"In addition to hundreds of wells, Mohenjo-daro would have had hundreds of staircases. As in Image 1 for example, many houses had stairs leading to upper courtyards of the building or to a second floor. This house in HR area had a double staircase that would allow people to enter and exit the upper courtyard in an orderly fashion. Some scholars feel this may have been a palace or a temple.

Distribution of seals/tablets within House AI, Block 1, HR at Mohenjodaro (After Jansen, M., 1987, Mohenjo-daro -- a city on the Indus, in Forgotten Cities on the Indus (M. Jansen, M. Mulloy and G. Urban Eds.), Mainz, Philip Von Zabern, p. 160). Jansen speculated that the house could have been a temple.
Image 2. House A1 may have been a temple or palace of an important leader. Two doorways lead to a narrow courtyard at a lower level. A double staircase leads to an upper courtyard surrounded by several rooms. This house had numerous seals and fragments of a stone sculpture depicting a seated man wearing a cloak over the left shoulder. Image 3. House 8, was an "average upper class house" in the HR section of Mohenjo-daro. John Marshall wrote "The living and sleeping rooms of the family were all on the upper floor, which was reached from the courtyard by way of the staircase 14 [Figure 3]. One of them, (No. 16) and the passage-ways 15 and 15a, are raised up on a solid basement, in order to provide against the menace of floods, the idea being to have at least one fair-sized room where the family cound find refuge if the rest of the house collapsed." (John Marshall, Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Civilization, pp. 19).
Image 4. This well located in DK-B area was originally surrounded by a paving that has recently been reconstructed and was reached by stairs."

Gold fillets, Mohenjo-daro:See: Mathematics or Metaphors of R̥ ca in R̥ gveda; presentation in Forum for Interdisciplinary Mathematics FIM2021, Dec. 27 https://tinyurl.com/ycx4y4xr
This Rtvij has been identified as Pot ̥r, an assistant of Brahman R̥ tvij ; potṛ ("purifier")

The following shape of fillet or head-bands may identify either Hot ̥r, or Adhvaryu
Hot ̥r, Adhvaryu Note: The inverted V in the middle of the head-band or gold fillet may orthographically signify Bharata = ṛtvija, produced by their rubbing the sticks together. This R̥ tvij may signify Hot ̥r. or agnīdh or Agnīdhra (priest, assistant of Hot ̥r who kindles the sacred fire).
Hot ̥r, Adhvaryu The following shape of fillet with the hypertext of 'standard device' -- kunda 'lathe' (Upper
register) rebus kundan 'fine, 24 ct. gold' PLUS कण्ठालः kaṇṭhālaḥ
'churning vessel' rebus कण्ठालः kaṇṭhālaḥ 'maritime, boat' (Bottom register). I speculate that this hypertext is a signifier of Adhvaryu

This gold fillet with gold maritime trade hypertext may signify Adhvaryu

It has been noted that a gold fillet of Mohenjo-daro also signified a standard device (lathe PLUS portable brazier) as proclamation (sangara) of furnace-, metal-work.

Such a fillet may also have been worn as a proclamation ornament on the forehead. Or, as an honour conferred on the inventor-metals-turner with competence in alloying metallurgical techniques.

होतृ, उद्गातृ , अयुर्ध्व (hotṛ, udgātṛ, adhvaryu) and ब्रह्मन् (brahman) are R̥ tvija (ಋಿ ತ್ವ ಜ), R̥ tvik - ṛtu a season, yaj to worship
(ऋत्विक् )— a priest who officiates at a yajña. R̥ tvik (ऋत्विक् ).—A Priest who officiates at a yāga. Those who perform yāgas like Agnisandhāna, Agniṣṭoma, Pākayaña etc. are called Ṛtviks. Manusmṛti, Chapter 2, Verse 143).
R̥ tvij (ऋत्विज् ) (k) a priest (usually four are enumerated, viz. Hot ̥r, Adhvaryu, Brahman, and Udgātṛ; each of them has three companions or helpers, so that the total number is sixteen, viz. hotṛ, Maitrāvaruṇa, Acchāvāka, Grāva-stut; adhvaryu, Prati-prasthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, Unnetṛ; brahman, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, Potṛ; udgātṛ, Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, Subrahmaṇya, [Āśvalāyana-śrauta-sūtra iv, 1, 4-6]), [Ṛg-veda; Atharva-veda; Taittirīyasaṃhitā; Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa; Kātyāyana-śrauta-sūtra etc.] (Monier-Williams)
RV 2.5.7
ःस्व स्वा य धायसे कृ णुतामृत्विगृत्विजम् । स्तोमं यंज्ञ चादरं वनेमा रररमा वयम् ॥
svaḥ svāya dhāyase kṛṇutām ṛtvig ṛtvijam | stomaṃ yajñaṃ cād araṃ vanemā rarimā vayam ||
“May he, the ministering priest, discharge the office of priest at his own ceremony; and may we worthily repeat (his) praise, and offer (him) sacrifice.”
Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
The ministering priest: Ṛtvij or a priest in genitive ral, in which capacity, Agni is invited to officiate for himself
RV 6.16.13
िामेग्न पुष्करादध्यथवाा ननरमन्थ त । मूर्ध्नो नवश्वस्य वाघतः ॥
tvām agne puṣkarād adhy atharvā nir amanthata | mūrdhno viśvasya vāghataḥ ||
“The sage, Atharvan, extracted you from upon the lotus-leaf, the head, the support of the universe.”
Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
Tvam puṣkarād adhi atharvo nirmanthata, murdhno viṣvasya vāghataḥ: puṣkarādadhi = puṣkaraparṇe, lotus-leaf; puṣkara parṇe prajāpatir bhūmim aparthayat = upon the lotusleaf prajāpati made manifest the earth, a probable acount of the creation in Manu; since it supported the earth, it may be termed the head, mūrdhan, or the bearer, vāghata for vāhaka, of all things; atharvan means prāṇa, vital air extracted fire or animal heat from the water, prāṇa udakasakāśād Agnim niśeṣaṇa mathitavān;
Vāghata = ṛtvij, the ministrant priest; so the sentence is explained: all the priests churned you out of the head or top of the wood of attrition

“Ambrosia is in the waters; in the waters are medicinal herbs; therefore, divine (priest), be prompt in their praise.”
Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
Deva = ṛtvij and other brāhmaṇas; ete vai devāḥ pratyakṣam yad brāhmaṇāḥ = these dieties, who are perceptibly (present) are the brāhmaṇas (Taittirīya Saṃhitā 1.7.3.1)
Ṛtvij (ऋत्विज् ).—Ved. Sacrificing at the proper season or regularly; -m. A priest who
officiates at a yajña or yāga; र्ज्ञस्य देवमृत्विजम् (yajñasya
devamṛtvijam) Rv.1.1.1; ऋत्विज्ञग्यकृ दयच्यते (ṛtvigyajñakṛducyate) Y.1.35; cf. Ms.2.143 also;
the four chief Ṛitvijas are होतृ, उद्गातृ , अयुर्ध्व (hotṛ, udgātṛ, adhvaryu) and ब्रह्मन् (brahman); at grand ceremonies 16 are enumerated.
Ṛtvik (ऋत्विक् ) refers to the “priests participating in the Vedic sacrifices”, as mentioned in the Śivapurāṇa 2.2.27. Accordingly as Brahmā narrated to Nārada:—“[...] once a great sacrifice was started by Dakṣa, [...] In that sacrifice that was being performed in that holy place of Kanakhala, Bhṛgu and other sages were made Ṛtviks by him (Dakṣa). [...] There were eighty-six thousand Ṛtviks in the performance of the sacrifice and sixty-four thousand Udgātṛs. The celestial sages Nārada and others acted as Adhvaryus and Hotṛs. They too were as many. The seven sages (jointly and) severally repeated the Sāman hymns”.
Note: The priests (Ṛtvijas) participating in the Vedic sacrifices are usually four in number. They are Hotṛ, Adhvaryu, Udgātṛ and Brahman corresponding to the four Vedas—Ṛg, Yajus, Sāman and Atharvan respectively. Each of the priests has three companions or helpers, the total no. is sixteen viz. Hotṛ—Maitrāvaruṇa, Acchāvāka, Grāvastut; AdhvaryuPratiprasthātṛ, Neṣṭṛ, Unnetṛ; Udgātṛ—Prastotṛ, Pratihartṛ, Subrahmaṇya and BrahmanBrāhmaṇācchaṃsin, Agnīdhra, Potṛ. See Āśvalāyana Śrauta Sūtra IV. 1.4-6.
[The Shiva Purana by J. L. Shastri | 1970 | Chapter 27 - The inauguration of Dakṣa’s sacrifice]
10. Large divine mansions of great value and brilliant lustre were erected by Tvaṣṭṛ[2] and assigned to them by Dakṣa.
[2]: Tvaṣṭṛ is identified with Viśvakarman, the divine architect.
17-18. There were eighty-six thousand Ṛtviks[4] in the performance of the sacrifice and sixtyfour thousand Udgātṛs. The celestial sages Nārada and others acted as Adhvaryus and Hotṛs. They too were as many. The seven sages[5] (jointly and) severally repeated the Sāman hymns.

1[1]. He chooses priests (for officiating at a sacrifice) with neither deficient nor superfluous limbs, 'who on the mother's and on the father's side (&c.),' as it has been said above.
2. Let him choose young men as officiating priests: thus (declare) some (teachers).
3. He chooses first the Brahman, then the Hotṛ, then the Adhvaryu, then the Udgātṛ.
4[2]. Or all who officiate at the Ahīna sacrifices and at those lasting one day.
5[3]. The Kauṣītakinas prescribe the Sadasya as the seventeenth, saying, 'He is the looker-on at the performances.'
6[4]. This has been said in the two Ṛcas, 'He whom the officiating priests, performing (the sacrifice) in many ways' (Rig-veda VIII, 58, I. 2).
7[5]. He chooses the Hotṛ first.
8. With (the formula), 'Agni is my Hotṛ; he is my Hotṛ; I choose thee N.N. as my Hotṛ' (he chooses) the Hotṛ.
9. With (the formula), 'Candramas (the moon) is my Brahman; he is my Brahman; I choose thee N.N. as my Brahman' (he chooses) the Brahman.
10. With (the formula), 'Āditya (the sun) is my Adhvaryu; (he is my Adhvaryu, &c.)'—the Adhvaryu.
11. With (the formula), 'Parjanya is my Udgātṛ; (he is my Udgātṛ, &c.)'—the Udgātṛ.
12[6]. With (the formula), 'The waters are my reciters of what belongs to the Hotrakas'—the Hotrakas.
13[7]. With (the formula), 'The rays are my Camasādhvaryus'—the Camasādhvaryus.
14. With (the formula), 'The ether is my Sadasya'—the Sadasya.
15. He whom he has chosen should murmur, 'A great thing thou hast told me; splendour thou hast told me; fortune thou hast told me; glory thou hast told me; praise thou hast told me; success thou hast told me; enjoyment thou hast told me; satiating thou hast told me; everything thou hast told me.'
16. Having murmured (this formula), the Hotṛ declares his assent (in the words), 'Agni is thy Hotṛ; he is thy Hotṛ; thy human Hotṛ am I.'



11
17. 'Candramas (the moon) is thy Brahman; he is thy Brahman (&c.)'—thus the Brahman.
18. In the same way the others according to the prescriptions (given above).
19[8]. And if (the priest who accepts the invitation) is going to perform the sacrifice (for the inviting person, he should add), 'May that bless me; may that enter upon me; may I thereby enjoy (bliss).'
20[9]. The functions of an officiating priest are not to be exercised, if abandoned (by another priest), or at an Ahīna sacrifice with small sacrificial fee, or for a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, or decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for such persons (the functions of a Ritvij should not be exercised).
21[10]. He (who is chosen as a Ṛtvij) should ask the Somapravāka, 'What sacrifice is it? Who are the priests officiating? What is the fee for the sacrifice?'
22. If (all the conditions) are favourable, he should accept.
23. Let (the officiating priests) eat no flesh nor have intercourse with a wife until the completion of the sacrifice.
24. 'By this prayer, O Agni, increase' (Rig-veda I, 31, 18)—with (this verse) let him offer (at the end of the sacrifice) an oblation of Ājya in (his own) Dakṣiṇāgni, and go away where he likes;
25. In the same way one who has not set up the (Śrauta) fires, in his (sacred) domestic fire with this Ṛc, 'Forgive us, O Agni, this sin' (Rig-veda I, 31, 16).

(Indische Studien, IX, 373; X, 355.) The priests officiating at such sacrifices are the sixteen stated in the Śrauta-sūtra IV, 1, 6. 7. Those besides the sixteen, though they are chosen (saty api varaṇe) for taking part in the sacred performances, have not the rank of ṛtvijas (officiating priests); such are the Sadasya, the Samitṛ, and the Camasādhvaryavaḥ (schol. Śrautas. loc. cit.). See Max Müller's History of A. S. L., pp. 450, 469 seq. As to the Sadasya, however, there was some difference of opinion (see the next Sūtra).

[5]: 'If the four (chief) priests have to be chosen, the choosing of the Brāhmaṇa stands first in order (see above, Sūtra 3); if all (the sixteen), then the choosing of the Hotṛ stands first in order.' Nārāyaṇa. [6]: The twelve priests of the sixteen (see § 4 note) who do not stand at the head of one of the four categories. Those at the head are enumerated in the Sutras [7]: 13, 14. See above, § 4 note. [8]: Priests who only perform the Agnyādheya for a person, are, according to Nārāyaṇa's note on this Sūtra, not considered as p. 196 performing a sacrifice for him; consequently the formula given here is only to be used by priests who are elected for a Soma sacrifice. Stenzler translates, 'So spricht er, wenn er das Opfer durch sie vollziehen lassen will.' But this would be yakṣyamāṇaḥ, not yājayiṣyan. [9]: The tradition takes nīcadakṣiṇasya as in apposition to ahīnasya, and I have translated accordingly. But I cannot help thinking that the two words should be separated, so that we should have to translate, 'or at an Ahīna, or for a person that gives small sacrificial fee.' Thus the Brāhmaṇa quoted by Āpastamba (see the commentary on the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vol. i, p. 6, ed. Bibl. Indica) gives the following questions which the Ritvij to be chosen should ask, 'Is it no Ahīna sacrifice? Is the Ritvij office not abandoned by others? Is the sacrificial fee plentiful?' It is a very singular fact, that on the one hand the assistance of a number of Ṛtvijas was unanimously declared necessary for the performance of an Ahīna sacrifice, while on the other hand it was considered objectionable, at least among some of the Vedic schools, to officiate at such a sacrifice. See Weber's Indische Studien, X, 150, 151. [10]: The Somapravāka is the messenger who invites the priests on behalf of the sacrificer to officiate at his intended Soma sacrifice. Comp.

The 1977 paper of Simo Parpola et al reviews texts containing references to Meluhha andMeluhhans, focussing on 9 texts dated to Ur III times (22nd to 21st cent. BCE) and includedreferences to Sargonic texts (24th to 23rd cen. BCE). (Parpola S., A. Parpola & R.H. Brunswig,Jr. (1977) “The Meluhha Village. Evidence of acculturation of Harappan traders in the late Third Millennium Mesopotamia.”(Journal of Economic and Social History of the Orient , 20, 129-165.)
Massimo Vidale provides a succint summary of the general picture presented in the paper ofSimo Parpola et al. The surprising references relate to the fact that metals like gold, silver



16
and tinwere imports from Meluhha and involved Meluhhan settlers in Ancient Far East. "The maximum archaeological evidence of Indian imports and Indusrelated artefacts in Mesopotamia may bedated to latest phases of ED III (at the Royal Cemetery of Ur) and immediately later to theAkkadian period, when, as widely reported, Sargon claimed with pride that under his powerMeluhhan ships docked at his capital, and at least one tablet mentions a person with an Akkadian name qualified as a “the holder of a Meluhha ship.”... (pp.262, 263)... according to the literary sources, between the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC Meluhhan shipsexported to Mesopotamia precious goods among which exotic animals, such as dogs, perhaps peacocks, cocks, bovids, elephants (? Collon 1977) precious woods and royal furniture, preciousstones such as carnelian, agate and lapislazuli, and metals like gold, silver and tin (among othersPettinato 1972; During Caspers 1971; Chakrabarti 1982, 1990; Tosi 1991; see also Lahiri 1992and Potts 1994). In his famous inscriptions, Gudea, in the second half of the 22nd century BC,states that Meluhhans came with wood and other raw materials for the construction of the maintemple in Lagash (see Parpola et al. 1977: 131 for references). Archaeologically, the mostevident raw materials imported from India are marine shell, used for costly containers and lamps,inlay works and cylinder seals; agate, carnelian and quite possibly ivory. Hard green stones,including garnets and abrasives might also have been imported from the Subcontinent andeastern Iran (Vidale & Bianchetti 1997, 1998-1999; Heimpel et al. 1988; Vidale 2002; see alsoCollon 1990, Tallon 1995 and Sax 1991). Carnelian could have been imported in form of rawnodules of large size (as implied by some texts) to be transformed into long beads, or as finished products. As we shall see, recent studies would better suggest that the Indus families inMesopotamia imported raw materials rather than finished beads (Kenoyer 1997; Kenoyer &Vidale 1992; Inizan 2000), and expediently adapted their production to the changing needs of theMesopotamian demand and markets. To the same period is ascribed a famous cylinder sealowned by a certain Su-ilisu, “Meluhha interpreter” (Sollberger 1970; Tosi 1991). Another Akkadian text records that Lu- sunzida “a man of Meluhha” paid to the servant Urur, son ofAmarluKU 10 shekels of silver as a payment for a tooth broken in a clash. The name Lu-sunzida literally means “Man of the just buffalo cow,” a name that, although rendered in Sumerian,according to the authors does not make sense in the Mesopotamian cultural sphere, and must be a translation of an Indian name...... the Mesopotamian demand and markets. To the same periodis ascribed a famous cylinder seal owned by a certain Su-ilisu, “Meluhha interpreter” (Sollberger1970; Tosi 1991). Another Akkadian text records that Lu-sunzida “a man of Meluhha” paid to the servant Urur, son of AmarluKU 10 shekels of silver as a payment for a tooth broken in aclash. The name Lusunzida literally means “Man of the just buffalo cow,” a name that, although rendered in Sumerian, according to the authors does not make sense in the Mesopotamian cultural sphere, and must be a translation of an Indian name."

"Seated male figure with head missing (45, 46). On the back of the figure, the hair style can be partially reconstructed by a wide swath of hair and a braided lock of hair or ribbon hanging along the right side of the back. A cloak is draped over the edge of the left shoulder and covers the folded legs and lower body, leaving the right shoulder and chest bare. The left arm is clasping the left knee and the hand is visible peeking out from underneath the cloak. The right hand is resting on the right knee which is folded beneath the body."

"[The Seated Nobleman was] found above pavement in N.E. corner of Chamber 75 in LArea. (its datum was 2.5 feet below datum.) Late Period. Material, veined grey alabaster. The figure, which is 11.5 inches high, is obviously that of a male and is dressed in a thin kilt-like garment fastened round the waist. (It is not clear how Mr. Mackay infers the existence of this kilt beneath the outer garment.–[ED.].) Another garment or shawl of thin material is worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm, and appears to hang down over the kilt. The



18
left knee of the figure is raised, but there is nothing to indicate the position of the right foot beneath it. The sculptor, and not subsequent weathering, is responsible for this lack of detail. The left arm is carried around the side of the left knee, so that the hand clasps the front of the knee. This hand is only roughly indicated, and the sculptor evidently was not clear how it should be arranged. Indeed, it is difficult to believe that the same man carved both the arms and hands, for the right arm, though of rough workmanship, shows some power of modeling, whereas the left arm and hand are positively shapeless. (It should not be forgotten that the left arm is hidden beneath the mantle or shawl, while the right arm is bare. It is not to be expected, therefore, that there should be much definition in the modeling of the left arm. Probably the mantle itself was painted, and this would have made a great difference to the apparent uncouthness of the lower part of the figure.) A squarish projection at the back of the head is evidently intended to represent a knot of hair. It is, however, unfinished and shows the chisel marks of the preliminary dressing. There is somewhat more finish about what may be a rope of hair hanging down the back." (John Marshall, Mohenjo-daro, Plate C, 1-3 (L 950), pp. 358-9).
Seated male sculpture, or "Priest King" from Mohenjo-daro. Fillet or ribbon headband with circular inlay ornament on the forehead and similar but smaller ornament on the right upper arm. The two ends of the fillet fall along the back and though the hair is carefully combed towards the back of the head, no bun is present. The flat back of the head may have held a separately carved bun as is traditional on the other seated figures, or it could have held a more elaborate horn and plumed headdress. Two holes beneath the highly stylized ears suggest that a necklace or other head ornament was attached to the sculpture. The left shoulder is covered with a cloak decorated with trefoil, double circle and single circle designs that were originally filled with red pigment. Drill holes in the center of each circle indicate they were made with a specialized drill and then touched up with a chisel. Eyes are deeply incised and may have held inlay. The upper lip is shaved and a short combed beard frames the face. The large crack in the face is the result of weathering or it may be due to original firing of this object.

Massimo Vidale, 2017, A “Priest King” at Shahr -i Sokhta? in:Archaeological Research in Asia
The paper discusses the published fragment of a statuette made of a buff-grey limestone,recently found on the surface of Shahr-i Sokhta (Sistan, Iran) and currently on exhibit in ashowcase of the archaeological Museum of Zahedan (Sistan-Baluchistan, Iran). Most probably, it belongs to a sculptural type well known in some sites of Middle and South Asia dating to the late3rd-early 2nd millennium BCE - a male character sitting on the right heel, with the left hand onthe raised left knee, and a robe leaving bare the left shoulder.Images of Zahedan torso (Shahr-i-Sokhta).

"The genetic evidence from Shahr-i-Sokhta, the biggest Helmand site, confirms that the relations with the Harappans were quite strong with nearly half of all ancient samples from that site considered to have been migrants from the Harappan region, especially from Baluchistan and the rest of the ancient samples showing admixture from these migrants. According to the French archaeologist, Jean Francois Jarrige, the principle excavator of Mehrgarh, as stated in this article, the foundation of Mundigak, the other Helmand site, can be interpreted as the settling of people from Baluchistan of the Mehrgarh Chalcolithic tradition and the remains of Period I at Mundigak fit almost perfectly the cultural assemblage of Mehrgarh Period III.
It is also significant that the pottery of Mundigak I, the earliest occupation of the “Helmand” cultural complex, corresponds to the Mehrgarh III pottery, in technique—quality of the paste and manufacture— as well in the shapes and decoration, probably within a phase dated to the end of the 5th millennium. The pottery of Mundigak I-II (fi g. 2: 3-5, 7-8) can also be related to the context of Balochistan ceramic productions, especially from Mehrgarh IV around 3500 BC.
The foundation of Mundigak, incidentally dates to around 5000 BC and is therefore significantly older to the foundation of Shahr-i-Sokhta, its sister site in Helmand more than 400 kms to its west, whose earliest dates go only upto 3300 BC and where we have already seen that the Harappan or Baluchistani migrants were already present from the earliest period."

[quote]While , “..there is general agreement that Shahr-i Sokhta and Mundigak have the same material culture including similar buff ceramic material, validating the existence of a Helmand Valley archaeological culture at the time corresponding to Period I at the former and Period III at the latter...” it also needs to be understood that “Shahr-i-Sokhta I nonetheless has inter-regional connections that are not recorded at Mundigak. In particular, a series of objects point to contacts to the west...”
With regard to Shahr-i-Sokhta, which in its most expansive phase was atleast around 150 hect. it should be noted that “...Shahr-i-Sokhta I is the foundation period of this site and that no other site (or no context at this site) has been observed thus far in Seistan with older archaeological deposits. Since no evidence for an older settlement is observed in this region, the most rational reconstruction is that Shahr-i Sokhta was founded by communities coming from (an)other area(s) in the late fourth millennium BCE.” (link same as above).
An important provenance study of the Shahr-i-Sokhta ceramics also indicated a strong influence from the west from the Baluchistani region and Mundigak. Almost all of the deluxe pottery that was found at the site and associated with elite graves was of non-local origin and were imports from the Iranian and Pakistani Baluchistan region.
The authors of this study also observe, “The possibility indeed remains that, for instance, the cultural assemblage at Mundigak, or a part of it, belonged to people who later moved to Shahr-i-Sokhta.”
We have already noted earlier how, Mundigak itself likely derives from the Mehrgarh Chalcolithic tradition of Pakistani Baluchistan. This tradition, also known as Damb Sadat or

Quetta pottery tradition is one of the 4 major early pottery traditions of Early Harappans. [unquote]

Priest-head, Mohenjo-daro, c. 2700 to 2000 BCE
Male head probably broken from a seated sculpture. Finely braided or wavy combed
hair tied into a double bun on the back of the head and a plain fillet or headband with
two hanging ribbons falling down the back (39, 40).
The upper lip is shaved and a closely cropped and combed beard lines the pronounced lower jaw. The stylized almond shaped eyes are framed by long eyebrows. The wide mouth is very similar to that on the "Priest-King" sculpture. Stylized ears are made of a double curve with a central knob.

George F. Dales
The eminent archaeologist George F. Dales (1927-1992, author of Excavations at MohenjoDaro, Pakistan: The Pottery) looks at a "creamy buff soft stone" sculpture, just under 10 centimeters in height, that he was shown and photographed in Afghanistan in the early 1970s. Remarkably similar to the Mundigak head, which itself bears resemblances to the "priestking" from Mohenjo-daro, Dales discusses how this head and another offers "an indication of an artistic sculptural tradition' within the Helmand civilization" (p. 222). While very careful to distinguish between the different stone sculptures found at Mohenjo-daro (there are few of these found at Indus sites, though some are of high quality, and not all have been published), he does note that four "iconographic and stylistic details common to the Afghanistan and one or another of the Mohenjo Daro sculptures are 1. the fillet descending in two flat bands at the back of their head, and having possible ornamentation in front 2. the distinctive rendering of



26
the ears 3. the taut, sharply incised horizontal mouth 4. the smaller than life size scale" (p. 223).
This paper, published in 1985, is best read together with Massimo Vidale's more recent A Priest-King at Shahr-i Sokhta? (2018) where he explores more directly possible similarities between another Helmand Civilization sculpture and the so-called priest king.
