Story of kaṃsa cāṇūra mardanam
वसुदेवसुतं देवं कं स चाणूर मददनम्‌ ।
देवकी परमानंन्द कृ ंष्ण वेन्द जगात्गुरुम्‌ ॥ -- From: कृ ष्णा अष्टकम
A definitive moment in the Itihasa of Bharatam Janam is the manifestation of Sri Krishna Avatara. The कृ ष्णा अष्टकम verse starts with the prayer and recollection of the
memory of slaying of कं स and चाणूर by Sri Krishna, the 11 year old boy.
When did this defining moment occur?

Prof. Srinivasa Raghavan’s work on the Kaliyugadi provides the clue. Srinivasa Raghavan ‘resents the horoscope of Sri Krishna and states that the date of birth of Sri Krishna is 11.40 PM Friday 27 July 3112 BCE; Bhadrapada month, Krishna Ashtami, Rohini Naksatra.
I submit that the kaṃsa cāṇūra mardanam occurred on 18 Feb. 3102 BCE, which is the start date of Kali Era calendar in Bharatiya pancanga tradition. Sri Krishna was 11 years of age on that date. The moment is so profound that the kaṃsa cāṇūra mardanam gets recognized as the momentous start of a new era, the Kali era.
We owe it to Prof. Srinivasa Raghavan who has presented the jyotisa evidence for the date of birth of Sri Krishna.
I submit that the date suggested by 3228 BCE as Sri Krishna's birth date by Prof. BV Raman is not consistent with the date of Yadava Civil war and the related jyotisa confirmation of planetary positions, which marks the end of Krishna Avatara. I submit that Prof. Srinivasa Raghavan has correctly computed the date of Yadava Civil war to be in 3031 BCE as seen from the attached excerpts.

Puranic encyclopaedia by Vettam Mani | 1975 | narrates the story of Kansa.
Son of Ugrasena, King of Mathurā, and an incarnation ofan Asura called Kālanemi...
Kālanemi was born as Kaṃsa and he killed the six children of Devakī by striking them on the ground. (Skandha 4, Devī Bhāgavata). The 10th Skandha of Bhāgavata states "killing

Kālanemi born as Kaṃsa" when it refers to the killing of Kaṃsa...In olden times there was a famous place called Madhuvana in the river-base of Kālindī. .. After the death of Śūrasena another King of the Yādava dynasty, Ugrasena, became the ruler of the place, Vasudeva accepting cow-rearing as his profession. Kaṃsa became King keeping Ugrasena as a prisoner. (Skandha 4, Devī Bhāgavata)... Vasudeva married Devakī daughter of Ugrasena and sister, of Kaṃsa. Kaṃsa pleased with his sister presented her with a chariot. Kaṃsa, Vasudeva and Devakī ascended the chariot and Kaṃsa himself drove the chariot. Then from an unknown source above came a voice which said "Oh King, know thou this and from this moment chalk out thy plans for the future. The eighth son of your sister will kill you for certain. You will be no match against him." (Chapter 1, Bhāgavata 10th Skandha). ...Man-hunt of Kaṃsa.
Pralamba, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta, Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśī, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and Pūtanā were born in the Asura family as servants of Kaṃsa. He sent them to different sides of the country to torment the Yādavas. Many Yādavas left the place. Even Kaṃsa’s father Ugrasena, a great devotee of Viṣṇu was teased.
In the meantime Devakī delivered six sons including Kīrtimān and all of them were killed by Kaṃsa by smashing their heads against the ground below. The seventh foetus of Devakī was aborted. (Instructed by Mahāviṣṇu, Māyādevī invoked the seventh foetus of Devakī and transferred it to the womb of Rohiṇī another wife of Vasudeva. The child thus born to Rohinī was Saṅkarṣaṇa or Balabhadrarāmā. Mahāviṣṇu then entered the womb of Devakī instructing Māyādevī to enter that of Yaśodā, wife of Nandagopa of Ambāḍi at the same time. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was then born in the figure of Viṣṇu. The watchmen were sleeping. Following directions from the new-born child Vasudeva took the child to Gokula and leaving the child there brought back the child of Yaśodā and placed it near Devakī. When the watchmen awoke and knew about the delivery of Devakī they immediately ran to Kaṃsa to tell him. Boiling with rage Kaṃsa rushed to the side of Devakī and taking the child by the legs raised it for smashing it against the ground. The child to the frightened dis may of Kaṃsa slipped from his hand and rising up in the air said "Hi, ill-mannered wicked Kaṃsa, do not waste your valour on women. Your killer has already been born on earth. Do search for him quickly."
Kaṃsa went pale with fright on hearing this and went away to his palace.
...
Kaṃsa is slain.
Ariṣṭaka was one of the prominent Asuras sent to kill Kṛṣṇa. He attacked Kṛṣṇa in the form of an ox. Śrī Kṛṣṇa killed it without any difficulty. Nārada who saw this incident informed Kaṃsa about it adding that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were the sons of Vasudeva only and the child who slipped out of his hands was the child of Yasodā. Kaṃsa got furious and he again imprisoned Vasudeva and Devakī and brought to Mathurā Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma and started thinking of ways and means to kill them. Kaṃsa arranged to conduct a grand celebration of Āyudhapūjā (worship of the weapons) and invited Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma for the same among many other gopas from Ambāḍi. He sent his chariot with Akrūra to fetch Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma from Ambāḍi. Akrūra privately informed Kṛṣṇa of the bad intentions of Kaṃsa. Nandagopa and many others from Ambāḍi started for Mathurā. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balabhadrarāma started their journey in the chariot the gopas and gopikās assembled there cried loudly. Some blamed Akrūra.

Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma reached Mathurā. There they slew a huge wild elephant and the five Asuras, Cāṇūra, Muṣṭika, Kūṭa, Śala and Kosala whom Kaṃsa had kept ready to kill Kṛṣṇa and Rāma. Sitting on a platform watching this, Kaṃsa became frightened and restless and roared with rage thus "The sons of Nandagopa should be instantly sent away from this palace. All their wealth and all that of the gopas should be confiscated. Bind with ropes the rogue Nandagopa, and kill the wicked Vasudeva. Throw my father, Ugrasena, into the river Kālindī bound hand and foot. Even a father should be killed if he was a relative of one’s enemy."
Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma boiled with rage when they heard the orders of Kaṃsa and Kṛṣṇa, jumping on to the platform pushed Kaṃsa down and jumping down along with him killed him. (10th Skandha, Bhāgavata).

Kaṃsa had employed as his body-guards many pugilists—Pralaṃbaka, Cāṇūra, Tṛṇāvarta, Muṣṭika, Ariṣṭaka, Keśi, Dhenuka, Agha and Vivida and these pugilists were sent with Pūtanā to Gokula to kill Śrī Kṛṣṇa. On the death of Pūtanā they returned to Mathurā. When Kaṃsa invited Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were the chief pugilists entrusted with the duty of killing Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa fought with Cāṇūra and Balabhadra with Muṣṭika. Both Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika were killed. (Bhāgavata Daśama Skandha).
