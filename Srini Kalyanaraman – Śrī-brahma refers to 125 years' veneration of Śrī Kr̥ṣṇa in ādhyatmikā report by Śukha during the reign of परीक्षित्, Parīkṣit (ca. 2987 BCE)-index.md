śrī-brahma refers to 125 years' veneration of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa in ādhyatmikā report by Śukha during the reign of
परीक्षित् , Parīkṣit (ca. 2987 BCE)
There was a king known by the name of Mahabhisha born in the race of Ikshvaku...King Mahabhisha ... recollecting all the monarchs and ascetics on earth, wished to be born as son to Pratipa of great prowess. (https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m01/m01097.htm Sambhava Parva Section XCVI Kisari Mohan Ganguli's translation.)
Kuru king Pratipa installed his son शंतनु, śaṁtanu, as king of Hastinapura. Thus, śaṁtanu is Mahabhisha of the previous birth.
चित्रंगद , citrāngada was a king in ancient India. In the Mahabharata, he is the elder son of śaṁtanu and Satyavati, ascending the throne of Hastinapura after his father's death...Gandharvas defeated the Kuru king and killed him...After having performed the rites of the dead, Bhishma immediately consecrated Chitrangada's younger brother Vichitravirya to the kingdom... चिचित्िीयर् , vicitravīrya became the king of Hastinapura because Chitrangada was killed by a gandharva of the same name when śaṁtanu was still alive. (van Buitenen (1973), pp. 224 to 230; Mbhr. 1.95.5-14 (Pune Critical Edition)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitrāngada
Note: A historical Kuru King named Dhritarashtra, son of चिचित्िीयर् , vicitravīrya is mentioned in the Kathaka Samhita of the Yajurveda (c. 1200–900 BCE) as a descendant of the Rigvedic-era King Sudas of the Bharatas. However, this Vedic mention does not provide corroboration for the accuracy of the Mahabharata's account of his reign.
Thus, चिचित्िीयर् , vicitravīrya is the grandfather of the Pandavas and Kauravas.
From these narratives, the sequence of Kings of Hastinapura can be sequenced as:
शंतनु, śaṁtanu
चित्रंगद , citrāngada
चिचित्िीयर् , vicitravīrya (The total period of reign of these three kings is 20 years).
After the MBh war, युक्षिक्षिर , Yudhiṣṭhira reigned as Emperor of Hastinapura for 36 years.
After the war and exit of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, Arjuna's grandson,परीचित्, Parīkṣit is made the Emperor of Hastinapura.
Thus, 20+36 years have elapsed when परीचित्, Parīkṣit becomes the Emperor and rules for 24 years.

Emperor Janamejaya जनमेजर् ascended to the throne of Hastinapura upon the death of his
father परीचित्, Parīkṣit.At Āsandīvat (Haryana), Janamejaya performs asvamedha yajna. Janamejaya was the son of King Parikshit and Queen Madravati according to the Mahabharata (I.95.85). (Roychaudhuri, ibid.,
p.15, n35). He was the grandson of great warrior Abhimanyu and the great-grandson of Arjuna, the valiant warrior hero of the Mahābhārata. Janamejaya जनमेजर् is the listener of the first narration of the Mahābhārata, narrated by Vaishampayana, a pupil of Vyasa.
According to the Mahabharata, परीचित्, Parīkṣit married princess Madravati of the Madra Kingdom, reigned for 24 years, and died at the age of 60, but this is a much later text and cannot be confirmed as historical fact.(Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (2006), Political History of Ancient India, Cosmo Publications, p.19.)
The ādhyatmikā conversation reported by Śukha occurs after ca. 20+36+24 years during the reign of परीचित्, Parīkṣit. This conversation is annexed. (Note. I correct a mistake I made in an earlier post. The statement about 125 years of veneration of Krishna is made by Sri Brahma and NOT by Parikshit, who is also a participant in the adhyatmika conversation reported by Sukhadeva.)
I suggest that the date of the conversion is ca. 3067 BCE + 80 years, i.e. 2987 BCE. On this date, 125 years have elapsed since the avatāra of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa occurred (i.e. since 3112 BCE)

Note on the war events:
युक्षिक्षिर , Yudhiṣṭhira is the first among the five Pāṇḍava brothers. Yudhisthira was appointed as the crown prince of Hastinapura but was replaced by Duryodhana. Because of Kunti's misunderstanding, Yudhishthira and his brothers were married to Draupadi, the princess

of Panchala. Dhritarashtra, on Bhishma's request, divided his kingdom to end the succession dispute between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana.
After he performed Rajasuya, he became the emperor and was invited to play Pachisi, a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and his uncle, Shakuni. There Yudhishthira gambled his kingdom, fame, wealth, his brothers, Draupadi and even himself. After the game the Pandavas and Draupadi were sent in exile for thirteen years, with the last year being an incognito. During his exile, Yudhishthira disguised himself as Kanka and served the king of Matsya Kingdom.
Yudhishthira was the leader of the successful Pandava side in the Kurukshetra War and defeated many warriors including Shalya. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira
Some years after his coronation at Indraprastha, Yudhishthira set out to perform the Rajasuya yagna. Yudhishthira was challenged to play a game of dice in Hastinapura by his cousin, Duryodhana. Duryodhana invited him because he was jealous of Yudhishthira's wealth and power that he witnessed at the Rajasuya. Shakuni used the dice made from the bones of his father, which always ensured that he got the number he wanted and Yudhisthira was allowed to bet whatever he had he was proud of and had right over. After losing his brothers and his empire, he bet himself and also his wife which lead to the Vastraharan. Later, he lost his kingdom in the game again and was forced into exile for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.
When the Pāṇḍavas returned to Hastinapura after exile, there was also a conflict between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana regarding the nomination of the crown prince of Hastinapura. Yudhishthira was originally made the crown prince of Hastinapura, but after the event of Lakshagriha, people thought that he was dead, and Duryodhana was made the new crown prince of Hastinapura. On Bhishma's advice, Dhritarashtra gave half of the kingdom to Pandavas to rule. However the barren land was under the control of Takshaka. Pandavas defeated Takshaka and with the help of Mayasura, they built a magnificent city named Indraprastha...
When the period of exile was completed, Duryodhana refused to return Yudhishthira's kingdom. Yudhishthira made numerous diplomatic efforts to retrieve his kingdom peacefully but in vain. He was convinced by Krishna to wage war.
Yudhishthira defeated many warriors in the War, such as Srutayudha and Duryodhana .He killed Madra king Shalya and his brother on the 18th and final day on the War.
After victory in the war, Yudhishthira was crowned as the Emperor of Hastinapura for 36 years. He performed Ashwamedha on Krishna and Vyasa's insistence.

Annex ādhyatmikā conversation reported by Śukha
Yudhishthira reigned for 36 years after 3067 BCE.
परीचित reigned for 24 years, i,e. upto ca. 3007 BCE [शंतनु and क्षित्रंगद also reigned from Hastinapur (I do not know for how long; maybe 20 years from ca. 3007 to 2987 BCE?)].
It is during परीचित reign that he refers to 125 years of veneration of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa (upto, say 36 PLUS 24 years after 3067 BCE, the war).
So, the veneration is until ca. 3007 BCE from the DOB of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa 3112 BCE). Thus, परीचित says -- in ca. 2987 BCE -- that Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is venerated for 125 years from 3112 BCE.
Yoga Māyā proclaims that an avatāra is pre-ordained to occur to kill Kamsa. Avatāra occurs. That Kaliyuga matures after the avatāra ends is another story; it is NOT the start date of KY, given the jyotiṣa uambiguous MBh epic texts.
The relevant Sanskrit verses from the Bhagavatam are as follows:
11060210 śrī-brahmovāca
11060211 bhūmer bhārāvatārāya purā vijñāpitaḥ prabho 11060213 tvam asmābhir aśeṣātman tat tathaivopapāditam 11060221 dharmaś ca sthāpitaḥ satsu satya-sandheṣu vai tvayā 11060223 kīrtiś ca dikṣu vikṣiptā sarva-loka-malāpahā 11060231 avatīrya yador vaṁśe bibhrad rūpam anuttamam 11060233 karmāṇy uddāma-vṛttāni hitāya jagato 'kṛthāḥ 11060241 yāni te caritānīśa manuṣyāḥ sādhavaḥ kalau 11060243 śṛṇvantaḥ kīrtayantaś ca tariṣyanty añjasā tamaḥ

and their translation if English are as follows:
(21) S'rî Brahmâ said: 'Oh Lord, we requested You previously to diminish the burden of the earth. Oh Unlimited Soul, You have fulfilled that request the way we wanted it.
(22) Having established the principles of dharma among both the pious souls and the seekers of truth, it is indeed Your glory spread by You in all directions, that removes the impurity of all the worlds.
(23) For the benefit of the universe assuming a form and descending in the Yadu dynasty, You with magnanimous deeds have performed incomparable activities.
(24) Oh Lord, those saintly souls who in the age of Kali hear and chant about Your activities, will easily overcome the darkness.
(25) Oh Supreme Personality, since Your descent in the Yadu-vams'a one hundred and twenty-five autumns have passed, oh Master.
Life-time of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is NOT 125 years; this period is referred to by परीक्षित् , Parīkṣit as a period of veneration since descent of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa(DOB 3112 BCE)
https://tinyurl.com/3ev3vc4t
This is an addendum to: Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, (DOB 27 July 3112), 11 year young kiśora kills Kaṃsa, emphatic evidence of avatāra -- skymaps, texts, sculptural gallery https://tinyurl.com/vpyvhp9c
The goof-up which has occurred citing 125 years as the life-time of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa is reconciled based on a correct interpretation of the text sources.

Sage Śukhdeva narrating the story of K ̥rṣṇa to परीक्षित् , Parīkṣit
The reference to the lapse of 125 years since descent of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED as a reference to the life-time of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa. It refers to the lapse of 125 years from the date of descent to the date when conversation with परीचित्, Parīkṣit is recorded as a statement by śrī-brahma in ŚB 11.6.25 as follows:
”...O my Lord, You have descended into the Yadu dynasty, and thus You have spent one hundred twenty-five autumns with Your devotees.”
I submit that this statement is made on some date during the 24 years’ reign of परीचित्, Parīkṣit.
Thus, I submit that 125 years’ lapse since descent SHOULD NOT BE wrongly interpreted as the life-time of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa.
परीचित्, Parīkṣit was a Kuru king who reigned during the Middle Vedic period (12th-9th centuries BCE). Along with his son and successor Janamejaya, he played a decisive role in the consolidation of the Kuru state, the arrangement of Vedic hymns into collections, and the development of the orthodox srauta ritual, transforming the Kuru realm into the dominant political and cultural center of northern Iron Age India. ...
Parikshit is eulogised in a hymn of the Atharvaveda (XX.127.7-10) as a great Kuru king (Kauravya), whose realm flowed with milk and honey and people lived happily in his kingdom. He is mentioned as the raja vishvajanina (universal king). (Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (2006), Political History of Ancient India, Cosmo Publications, pp.10-13)
Abhimanyu is the son of Arjuna and Subhadra. परीचित् is the posthumous son of Abhimnyu. (ibid., pp. 11-16). He was succeeded by his son Janamejaya. ...
According to the Mahabharata, he ruled for 24 years and died at the age of sixty. (ibid., p.19)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parikshit
Canto 11 is a conversation with परीचित्, Parīkṣit; Canto 10 Texts 5-7 clearly provide the date of the conversation, which refers to his grandfather Arjuna (contemporary of K ̥rṣṇa, with same year of birth) :

Taking the boat of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, my grandfather Arjuna and others crossed the ocean of the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, in which such commanders as Bhīṣmadeva resembled great fish that could very easily have swallowed them.
Thus, the reference to 125 years in ŚB 11.6.25 refers to the date when conversation of परीचित्, Parīkṣit. occurs:
यदुवंशेऽवतीणस्यर् भवत: पुरुषोत्तम । शरच्छतं व्यतीयरय पक्षञ्चवंशरक्षिकं प्रभो ॥ २५ ॥
yadu-vaṁśe ’vatīrṇasya bhavataḥ puruṣottama śarac-chataṁ vyatīyāya pañca-viṁśādhikaṁ prabho
O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O my Lord, You have descended into the Yadu dynasty, and thus You have spent one hundred twenty-five autumns with Your devotees.
3067 MINUS 2987 BCE = 80 years have elapsed between the end of MBh war and the reign of the grandson of Arjuna, परीचित्, Parīkṣit as King.:
परीचित्, Parīkṣit. Refers to the period of 125 autumns of adoration of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, since the date of his birth in 3112 BCE. This yields the date of 2987 BCE when the conversation takes place. By this date, 2987 BCE, 125 years have elapsed since the descent of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa into the Yadu dynasty – AND adoration by Śrī K ̥rṣṇa devotees.

The reference to 125 years SHOULD NOT BE wrongly interpreted as the life-time of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa.
Canto 10: The Summum Bonum
The Advent of Lord Kṛṣṇa: Introduction
The summary of the First Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes how Kaṁsa, frightened by hearing an omen about his being killed by the eighth son of Devakī, killed Devakī’s sons one after another.
When Śukadeva Gosvāmī finished describing the dynasty of Yadu, as well as the dynasties of the moon-god and sun-god, Mahārāja Parīkṣit requested him to describe Lord Kṛṣṇa, who appeared with Baladeva in the Yadu dynasty, and how Kṛṣṇa performed His activities within this world. Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, the King said, and therefore to understand His activities is the occupation of liberated persons. Hearing of kṛṣṇa-līlā is the boat by which to achieve the ultimate goal of life. Except for an animal killer or one who is following a policy of suicide, every intelligent person must strive to understand Kṛṣṇa and His activities.
Texts 5-7:
Taking the boat of Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, my grandfather Arjuna and others crossed the ocean of the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, in which such commanders as Bhīṣmadeva resembled great fish that could very easily have swallowed them.

Unfortunately, in Kali-yuga many persons are not attracted to the authorized Vedic literatures. Minimizing the transcendental process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead, they prefer to listen to useless and whimsical vibrations on the radio and television, in newspapers and magazines, and so on. Rather than hear about Kṛṣṇa from the bona fide spiritual master, they endlessly give their own opinions about everything, until they are dragged away by the force of time. After studying the temporary, limited forms of the material world, they impatiently conclude that the Absolute Truth is formless. Such persons are actually worshiping Kṛṣṇa’s illusory energy, māyā, who has been authorized to kick their stubborn heads. If instead people hear directly about Kṛṣṇa from the bona fide sources, they will very easily solve all the problems of their lives. In Kali-yuga people are constantly suffering from many psychological, social, economic, historical, political and existential problems. But all these nightmarish problems can be removed as soon as one awakens to the transcendental reality of the Personality of Godhead, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge and beyond the bewildering manifestations of the material energy. The Lord appears within this universe so that people can observe, hear about and glorify His actual activities. In this difficult Age of Kali we should all seriously take advantage of this opportunity.

O Lord, You are the basis of everything, and if You so desire, kindly return now to Your own abode in the spiritual world. At the same time, we humbly beg that You always protect us. We are Your humble servants, and on Your behalf we are managing the universal situation. We, along with our planets and followers, require Your constant protection.

The heroes of the Yadu dynasty were so powerful that even the demigods could not check them.

If I were to leave this world without withdrawing the overly proud members of the Yadu dynasty, the whole world would be destroyed by the deluge of their unlimited expansion.
Purport
Just as a tidal wave overwhelms the boundary of the shore and wreaks havoc on innocent people, similarly, there was imminent danger that the powerful Yadu dynasty might expand beyond all boundaries of social and political control. The members of the Yadu dynasty had become proud because of their apparent familial relationship with the Personality of Godhead. Although they were very religious and devoted to brahminical culture, they had become, as indicated by the word dṛptānām, affected by pride due to their relationship with

Kṛṣṇa. Furthermore, due to their intense love for Kṛṣṇa, they would certainly feel such intense separation after the Lord’s departure to the spiritual world that they would become maddened and thus become an unbearable burden on the earth. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has pointed out, however, that the earth herself, due to attachment for Kṛṣṇa, would never consider Kṛṣṇa’s own family members to be anything but a welcome burden. Still, Kṛṣṇa wanted to remove this burden. The example is given that for the pleasure of her husband a beautiful young wife may decorate herself with many golden ornaments. These ornaments constitute a painful burden for the delicate wife, but although she is willing to bear this burden, the loving husband removes the ornaments for the pleasure of his wife. So the Lord, desiring to apply the wisdom of “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” took precautions to remove from the earth the burden of the Yadu dynasty.

The members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal servants of the Lord; therefore Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained the word nāśaḥ, or “destruction,” as nigūḍhāyāṁ dvārakāyāṁ praveśanam ity arthaḥ: the members of the Yadu dynasty entered into the hidden or confidential Dvārakā in the spiritual world, which is not manifested here on the earth. In other words, Dvārakā, the Lord’s abode, is manifest on the earth, and when the earthly Dvārakā is apparently removed, the eternal Dvārakā in the spiritual world remains as it is. Since the members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, there is no question of their destruction. Only our conditioned vision of their manifestation was destroyed. This is the meaning of the word nāśaḥ.

Many demigods, coming to the earth to assist Lord Kṛṣṇa in His pastimes, took birth within the Yadu dynasty and appeared as Lord Kṛṣṇa’s associates. When the Lord had completed His earthly pastimes He wanted to send these demigods back to their previous service in universal administration. Each demigod was to return to his respective planet. The transcendental city of Dvārakā is so auspicious that whoever dies there immediately goes back home, back to Godhead, but because the demigod members of the Yadu dynasty, in many cases, were not yet prepared to go back to Godhead, they had to die outside the city of Dvārakā. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, pretending to be an ordinary living being, said, “We are all in danger. Let us all immediately go to Prabhāsa.” In this way, by His yoga-māyā Kṛṣṇa bewildered such demigod members of the Yadu dynasty and led them away to the holy place Prabhāsa.
Since Dvārakā is parama-maṅgala, the most auspicious place, not even an imitation of inauspiciousness can take place there. Actually, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastime of removing the Yadu dynasty is ultimately auspicious, but since it outwardly appeared inauspicious, it could not take place in Dvārakā; therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa led the Yadus away from Dvārakā. After having sent the demigods back to their planets, Lord Kṛṣṇa planned to return to the spiritual world, Vaikuṇṭha, in His original form and remain in the eternal city of Dvārakā.
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has made the following important comments on this verse. Prabhāsa is a famous holy place located near the Veraval railway station, within the region of Junagarah. In Chapter Thirty of the Eleventh Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is written that after hearing the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Yādavas went to the mainland from the island city of Dvārakā by means of boats and then traveled to Prabhāsa in chariots. At Prabhāsa-kṣetra they drank a beverage called maireya and became engaged in a mutual quarrel. A great battle ensued, and killing each other with hard stalks of cane, the members of the Yadu dynasty acted out the pastime of their own annihilation.
Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, manifesting His four-armed form, sat down under a pippala tree, placing His left foot, the heel of which was colored red like the red koka-nada lotus, upon His right thigh.



16
A hunter named Jarā, watching from the shore of the ocean at Prabhāsa, mistook the Lord’s red-colored foot to be the face of a deer and shot his arrow at it.
At the base of that same pippala tree under which Lord Kṛṣṇa had sat there is now a temple. One mile away from the tree, on the seashore, is the Vīra-prabhañjana Maṭha, and it is said that from this point the hunter Jarā fired his arrow.
In the conclusion to his work Mahābhārata-tātparya-nirṇaya, Śrī Madhvācārya-pāda has written the following purport to the mauṣala-līlā. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to bewilder the demons and ensure that the word of His own devotees and of the brāhmaṇas be maintained, created a body of material energy into which the arrow was shot. But the Lord’s actual four-armed form was never touched by the arrow of Jarā, who is actually the Lord’s devotee Bhṛgu Ṛṣi. In a previous age Bhṛgu Muni had placed his foot on the chest of Lord Viṣṇu. In order to counteract the offense of improperly placing his foot on the Lord’s chest, Bhṛgu had to take birth as a degraded hunter. But even though a great devotee willingly accepts such a low birth, the Personality of Godhead cannot tolerate seeing His devotee in such a fallen condition. Thus the Personality of Godhead arranged that at the end of Dvāpara-yuga, when the Lord was winding up His manifest pastimes, His devotee Bhṛgu, in the form of the hunter Jarā, would cast the arrow into a material body created by the Lord’s illusory energy. Thus the hunter would become remorseful, gain release from his degraded birth and go back to Vaikuṇṭha-loka.
Therefore, to please His devotee Bhṛgu and to confuse the demons, the Supreme Lord manifested His mauṣala-līlā at Prabhāsa, but it should be understood that this is an illusory pastime. The Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, from His very appearance on the earth, did not manifest any of the material qualities of ordinary human beings. The Lord did not appear from the womb of His mother. Rather, by His inconceivable power He descended into the maternity room. At the time of His giving up this mortal world, He similarly manifested an illusory situation for the sake of bewildering the demons. To bewilder the nondevotees, the Lord created an illusory body out of His material energy while simultaneously remaining personally in His own sac-cid-ānanda body, and thus He manifested the downfall of an illusory material form. This pretense effectively bewilders foolish demons, but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s actual transcendental, eternal body of bliss never experiences death.
Also at Prabhāsa-kṣetra there is the holy place known as Bhṛgu-tīrtha, which was manifested by Lord Paraśurāma. The place at which the two rivers Sarasvatī and Hiraṇyā flow together into the ocean is named Bhṛgu-tīrtha, and there the hunter cast his arrow. There is an elaborate description of Prabhāsa-tīrtha in the Prabhāsa-khaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa. There are also many phala-śrutis given within the Mahābhārata in connection with Prabhāsatīrtha. Phala-śrutis are scriptural statements that promise various auspicious results for one who performs a particular pious activity. In the following verses the Lord Himself will explain the particular benefits to be derived from visiting Prabhāsa-kṣetra and performing religious activities there.
