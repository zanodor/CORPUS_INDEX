Preface to new edition
M uch new material on the m ythical im agcry o f O ld Europe has cm ergcd during the tcn-year interval between the w ritin g o f The Gods and Goddeacs oJ'O'id Europe and the present edition, but the basic concepts have rem aincd unehanged. T h e nevv discovcrics- have served on ly to strongthcn and support the vievv that the cuiture calied O ld Europi1 w as characterized b y a dom inancc o f w o m an in societv and vvorship o f a Goddess incarnating the Creative principle as Source and G iv er o f A li. In this cuiture the m ale elem ent, man and anim ai, represented spontaneous and life-stim ulating - but not lifegenerating - pow ers. This p riority is represented in the present title by a ehange in w ord order, from The Gods and Goddesses to The Goddesses and Gods o j O ld Europe.
T h e term O ld Europe is applied to a pre-In do-European cuiture o f Europe, a cuiture m a trifo ca l and probably m a trilin e a r, agricultural and sedentary, egalitarian an d peaceful. It contrasted sharply with the cnsuing proto-Indo-European cuiture which was patriarchal, stratified, pastoral, m obile, and vvar-oriented, superim posed on ali Europe, except the S o u th ern a n d vvestern fringes, in th e course o f three w aves o f infiltration from the Russian steppe, between 4500 and 2500 bc. D uring and after this period the fem ale deities, or m ore accurately th e Goddess Creatrix in her m any aspeets, w erc largely replaccd by the predom inantly m ale divinities o f the IndoEuropeans. W hat developed after c. 2500 uc: was a m elange o f the tw o m ythic svstems, Old European and Indo-European. The analysis o f Old European m ythical im agery has reconstituted a link between the religion o f the U p p er Palaeolithic and that o f the pre-Indo-European substratum o f European cultures; without consideration of the very rich evidence from O ld Europe, neither the Palaeolithic ideological struetures nor those o f early historic Greeks and other Europeans can be well understood. The persistence o f the Goddess vvorship for m ore than 20,000 years, from the Palaeolithic to the N eolithic and beyond, is shown by the continuity o f a variety



o fascries o f conventionalizcd images. H er specific aspccts o f pow er such as life -g iv in g , fertility-givin g, and b irth -givin g are extrem ely long lasting. Their indentification was made through study o f sym b o licsign sin cised o n figu rin esan d asso ciated culticobjects, as w ell as postures, attributes, and associations. M o re o f this detailed evidence w ill appear in a forth co m in g study by the author on signs and sym bols o f O ld Europe. The object o f the present vo lu m e is to transm it som e notion o f the variety and com plexity o f the philosophical ideas o f our European forebears.
Los Angeles, California i gSi Marija Gimbutas In tro d u c tio n
T h e tradition o f sculpture and painting encountered in O ld Europe (for a defm ition o f this term, sec p. 17) was transmitted from the Palaeolithic era. I11 art and m ythical im agery it is not possible to draw a line between the tw o eras, Palaeolithic and N eolithic, ju st as it is not possible to draw a line between w ild and dom estic plants and animals. M uch o f the sym bolism o f the early agriculturists was taken over from the hunters and fishers. Such im ages as the fish, snake, bird, or horns are not N eolithic creations; they have roots in Palaeolithic times. And yct, the art and myths o f the first farm crs difFered in inspiration and hence in form and content from those o f the hunters and fishers. C lay and stone figurines were being fashioncd long before pottery was first made around 6500 BC. The vast increase in sculptures in N eolithic times and the extent to which they departed from Palaeo lithic types was not caused b y technological innovations, but b y the permanent settlement and grow th o f com m unities. A farm ing econom y bound the villages to the soil, to the biological rhythm s o f the plane; and animals upon which their existence w h o lly depcnded, G yclical ehange, death and resurrcetion, vvere ascribed to the supernatura) povvers and in conseqitence speeial provision vvas made to p ro te « the capricious lifc forces and assure their perpetuation. As carly as the scventh m illennium n c traits associated w ith the psychol~ o g y and religion o f the farm er are a characteristic fcature o f sculptural art. This art was not consciously im itative o f natura] form s but sought rather to express abstract conceptions. A bout 30,000 miniature sculptures o f clay, marble, bone, copper or gold are presently know n from a total o f some 3000 sites o f the N eo lith ic and Chalcolithic era in southeastem Europe. Enorm ous quantitites o f ritual vessels, altars, sacrificial cquipm ent, inscribed objeets, clay models o f tem ples, actual temples and pictorial paintings on vases or on the vvalls o f shrines, already attest a genuine civilization.



T h e three m illennia saw a progressive increase in stylistic đ ive rsity , producing ever greater varicty ofindividual forms. Simultancously, a m ore naturalistic expression o f anatomical generalitics gradually em ancipated itself from an initial subordination to the sym bolic purpose. T he study o f these m ore articulatcd sculptures, their ideogram s and sym bols and the h igh ly developed vasc painting enabled the author to distinguish the different types o f goddesses and gods, their epiphanies, their devotees, and the cult scenes with which they w ere associated. T h u s, it is possible to speak o f a pantheon o f gods, and to reconstruct the various costumes and masks, which th row m ach light 011 ritual dram a and life as it was then lived. T h ro u g h the deciphering o f stereotype im ages and signs w ith the help o f quantitative and qualitative analyses it becomes clear that these early Europeans expressed their com inunal w orship through the rnedium o f the idol. In the m iniature sculptures o f O ld Europe the em otions are made manifest in ritual drama in v o lvin g m any actors, both gods and worshippers. M uch the same practice secms to have bccn currcnt in A natolia, Syria, Palestine and M esopotam ia in the corresponding periods, but only in southcastem Europe is such a quantity o f figurines available for a com parative study. The shrines, cult objeets, m agnificent paintcd and black pottery, costumes, elaborate religious cerem onialism, and a rich m ythical im agery far more com plex than was hitherto assumed, speak o f a refined European culture and society. N o longer can European N eohthic-Chalcolithic developm ents bc summ cd up in the old axio m , E x oriente lux.
W hen the m agnificent treasures o f the M inoan civilization w ere unravclled in the beginning o f the twentieth century, Sir A rthu r Evans w ro te : ‘I venture to believc that the scientific study o f Greek civilization is becom ing less and less possible w ithout taking into constant account that o f the M inoan and M ycenacan w orld that vvent before it’ (JH S 19 1 2 : 277). W hile his rem ark was am p ly ju stified, the question o f w hat went before the M inoan civilization rem ained to be posed. N o w it is becom ing less and less possible to understand the M inoan civilization vvithout the study o f the culture which preceded it. The study o f this culture, to which I have applied the nam e ‘ O ld E u ro p e’, rcveals new chronological dim ensions and a new concept o f the beginning o f European civilization. It was not a single small legendary island claim ed b v the sea som e 9000 years ago that gave rise to the fabulous civilization o f C rete and the C yclad es, but a considerable part o f Europe surrounded by the castem M editerranean, Aegean and Adriatic Seas. The many islands w ere an aid to navigation and facilitated com m unication with Ana tolia, Levant and M esopotam ia. Fertile river valleys lured the first farm ers deeper inland into the Balkan Peninsula and Danubian
Europe. O ld Europe is a produet o f hybridization o f M editerranean and Tem perate southeast-European peoples and cultures. European civilization between 6500 and 3500 b c was not a p rovincial refleetion o f N ear Eastem civilization, absorbing its achievements through diffusion and periodic invasions, but a distinet culture developing a unique identity. M an y aspeets o f this culture rem ain to be explored. O ne o f the main purposes o f this book is to present, as it w ere, the spiritual manifestations o f O ld Europe. M y thical im agery o f the prehistoric era tclls us much abou t hum anity - its concepts o f the strueture o f the cosmos, o f the beginning o f the w o rld and o f human, plant and animal life, and a'lso its struggle and relations w ith nature. It cannot be forgotten that through m yth, im ages and sym bols man com prehended and manifested his being.
T h o u g h profusely illustrated, this vo lu m e docs not claim to present every aspect o f the m y thical im agery o f O ld E u ro pe; the illustrations w ere seleeted from m any thousands, w ith a view to sh ow in g the most representative exam ples and not ju st the most beautiful sculptures or vases. Basic inform ation is derived from the system atically excavated sites, which are listed w ith full chronological details at the end o f the book. The docum entation o f the illustrated objeets is contained in the C atalogue.
N ote on radiocarbon and dendrochronologically CALIBRATED DATES AND THE CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE
T he d iscovcry and developm ent o f the radiocarbon dating technique by W illard F. L ibb y (Radiocarbon Dating, 1952) gave archaeology its most pow erful means o f diseovering the age o f prehistoric cultures. W ithin tw o decades o f its developm ent and im plem entation radio carbon analysis had revolutionized earlier conceptions o f European N eo lith ic-C h alcolith ic chronology, extending its span by alm ost tw o m illennia. Prior to this, stratigraphic and typological interpretations had been used to support a theory o f the spread o f agriculture from the N ear East to Europe in the fourth m illennium b c . The backbone o f this universally accepted chronological outline was the postulated N ear Eastem đerivation o f the Vinca culture w ith its typical fine ceramics, rcsult o f a m igration from the N ear East via A natolia subsequent to the T ro y I period, datable, it w as believed, by analogies to historic Egypto-M esopotam ian civilization to ju st after 3000 b c. Vinca was firm ly located within the relative chron olo g y o f the European N eolithic-C halcolithic cultures and so through its supposed historic conncction becam e the datum around which the absolute ch ron ology o f European prehistory was estimated. This chronological system is still maintained by a small m inority o f



European prehistorians w ho w ere encouraged b y the recent disc o very in an E arly V inča context o f the Tartaria tablets, w hich they consider to be an im port from M esopotam ia at about 3000 BC. This chronology was com pletely discredited by radiocarbon analysis, w hich by 1970 had supplied 300 dates for O ld European N eo lith ic and C h alcolithic samples, placing the beginnings o f the N eolithic in the seventh m illennium BC. This called for not only a readjustm ent in the absolute dating o f N eo lithic-C h alcolith ic cuiture but also an im portant rearrangem ent o f the relative chronologies o f Europe and the N ear East. H ow ever, b y the early 1960’s it became evident that radiocarbon dates w ere inaccurate. T h e accuracy o f the process was dependent upon the valid ity o f the assumption (am ong others) that the radio carbon content o f atmospheric carbon-dioxide had remained constant during geologically recent time. Discrepancies between radiocarbon and calendrical chronologies w ere soon rem arked, follow in g the radiocarbon analysis o f w ood samples o f know n age from historic E gyp tian and N ear Eastern sources; and it has since been dem onstrated through the m arriage o f dendrochronological research and radiocarbon analysis that there have been variations in the level o f atm ospheric radiocarbon through time, and that these are o f tw o sorts: localized fluctuations, and a lon g-term trend in w hich the divergence between the radiocarbon and true ages increases with increasing sam ple age during the m illennia b c . D e n d ro ch ro n o lo g y is the study o f the chronological sequence o f the annual g ro w th rings in trees. W ithin the confines o f a particular environm ent the ring patterns o f different tree specimens can be m atched and related one to another, a technique made possible b y the fact that annual rings vary in thickness due to varyin g local environm ental conditions from year to year. So a m aster-ch ron ology can be com piled incorporating both living trees o f great age and dead, prcscrvccl trunks w hich can be fitted into the ring-pattern sequence. The bristle-cone pine o f the W hite M ountains o f C a lifo rnia has p rovidcd an unbroken sequencc extending back into the sixth m illennium b c . Radiocarbon analysis o f ring samples o f known age idcntified the inaccuracy o f the radiocarbon dates; and, w id i the accum ulation o f sufficient analyses, was able to supply curves and tables o f conversion which perm it corrcction o f radiocarbon dates to approxim ate true age. Dates falling between the third and fifth m illennia b c in ‘radiocarbon years’ require a corrective addition, incrcasingly large w ith increasing age, o f a few hundred to as m uch as a thousand years to align them with approxim ate true age. D irect com parison o f the radiocarbon content o f historically dated samples from ancient Egyptian contexts with that o f bristle-cone pine samples o f equivalent true age has indcpcndently confirm ed the validity o f
U
the m ethod. C u rren tly archaeologists ineluding the author o f this volum e use the ‘ Suess curve’ (named after D r Hans E. Suess, o f U C S D ) fo r corrcction o f radiocarbon dates to app ro xim ate true age. Consequcntly, European Neolithic and Chalcolithic chronology is u ndergoing a second revolution which extends the span o f prchistoric developm ent by a further millennium. The most important effect o f radiocarbon ch ron ology and o f this m arked extcnsion o f it to approxim ate true age has been to dem onstrate the antiquity o f European prehistoric cuiture, and its autonom ous g ro w th as the equal rather than the dependent o f N ear Eastern cultural evolution. Socio-econom ic developm ents that 20 years ago w ere compressed into little over one m illennium are now seen to have required at least three m illennia to evolve, emphasizing the stability, lon gevity and cultural continuity o f the O ld European N eo lith ic-C h alcolith ic civilization. A chronological table o f the cultural com plexes o f O ld Europe appears below . The given years represent true age, i.e. radiocarbon dates converted into true age on Suess’ calibration curve.

SIGNiFICANCE
Villages depending upon domcsticatcd plants and animals had appeared in southeastem Europe as carly as the seventh m illcnnium BC, and the spiritual forces accom panying this ehange in the economic and social organization are manifested in the em ergent artistic tradition o f the N eolithic. The developm ent o f a food-producing econom y and subsequent cultural innovations can no longer be sim ply cxplained as an introduetion o f vagu ely designated colonists from A natolia or the east M editerranean. D uring the seventh, sixth and fifth millennia b c the farmers o f southeastem Europe evolved a unique cultural pattern, contemporary with similar developments in Anatolia, M esopotam ia, Syro-Palestine and E gyp t. It reached a clim ax in the fifth m illcnnium b c . A new designation, Civilization o j Old Europe, is introduced herc in recognition o f the collective identity and achievem ent o f the diffcrent cultural groups o f Neolithic-Chalcolithic southeastem Europe. The area it occupied extends from the Acgcan and A driatic, I ineluding the islands, as far north as C zechoslovakia, southem Poland and the vvestem Ukraine. Between c. 7000 and c, 3500 ne, the inhabitants o f this region developed a much m ore com plex social organization than their vvestem and northem neighbours, form ing scttlements which often amounted to small tovvnships, inevitably in vo lvin g eraft specialization and the creation o f religious and governm ental institutions. T h ey independently diseovered the possibility o f utilizing copper and gold for ornaments and cools, and even appear to have evolved a rudim entary script. If one defines civilization as the ability o f a given people to adjust to its environment and to develop adequate arts, technology, script, and social relationships it is evident that Old Europe achicved a m arked degrce o f success.

T he most eloquent vestiges o f this European N eolithic cuiture are the sculptures, w hich bear witness to facets o f life otherw ise inaccessible to the archaeologist: fashions in dress, religious cerem onialism and m ythical images. The inhabitants o f southeastem Europe 7000 years ago were not the p rim itive villagers o f the incipient N eolithic. D uring tw o millennia o f agricultural stability their material welfare had been persistently im proved by the increasingly efficient exploitation o f the fertile river valleys. W h e a t , barley, vetch, peas and other legum es w ere cultivated, and ali the dom esticated animals present in the B alkans today, except for the horse, w cre bred. Pottery tech nology and bone- and stone-w orkin g techniques had advanced, and copper m e t a l l u r g v was in t r o d u c e d into east Central Europe by 5 5 0 0 b c .
Tr'ade and C om m unications, which had expanded th ro u gh the millennia, must have provided a tremendous cross-fertilizing im petus to cultural grow th . T h e archaeologist can infer the existence o f far-ranging trade from the w ide dispersion o f obsidian, alabaster, m arbleandSpondylusshcll. Theseasand inland waterwaysdoubtlcss served as p rim ary routes o f com m unication, and obsidian was being transported by sea as early as the seventh m illennium b c . T h e use o f sailing-boats is attested from the sixth m illennium onw ards b y their incised depiction on ceramics. T h e continued increase in prosperity and in the com p lexity o f social organization w o uld surely have produced in southeastern Europe ah urban civilization broadly analogous to those o f the N ear East and C rctc o f the third and sccond millennia b c . The increasing cultural m om entum o f ’fifth m illennium European societics was, hov/ever, cut short by the aggressive infiltration and settlement o f sem i-nom adic pastoralists, ancestors o f the IndoEuropeans, w h o d istu rb e d most o f C entral and eastern Europe during the fourth m illennium b c . The colourful pottery and sculptural art o f O ld Europe’s incipient civilization quickly vanished; only around the A egean and on the islands did its traditions su rvivc to the end o f the third m illennium b c , and on Crete to the m id-second m illen nium b C. T h e Early H elladic cuiture o f Greece and the C yclades and the M inoan civilization on C rete, w ith its wealth o f palače art, epitom ize the N eolithic and Chalcolithic cuiture o f O ld Europe.
R e g i o n a l a n d c h r o n o l o g i c a l s u b d i v i s i o n s o f O i.d E u r o p e
T h e d evclopm cn t o f the N eo lith ic was characterizcd by an increase in sedentary habits and rcliance upon dom esticated plants and anim als, larger d em ograph ic units, a continued grow th in artistic and technological sophistication, and a marked regional diversity o f material cuiture.

I THE AEGEAN AND CENTRAL BALKAN AREA
Neolithic, C. 70 00-5500 BC.
T h e beginnings o f N eo lith ic art in the A egean and central Balkan area can be dated to c. 7000-6500 BC, along w ith the em ergence o f a well-established village society. This earliest N eolithic is k n o w n b y a different name in each o f the m odern European countries over which it was distributed, the term inological distinetions refleeting m od em political boundaries rather than significant cultural variations. It is k n o w n as Proto-Sesklo in G reece, w here the Sesklo settlem ent near Volos in Thessaly was the source o f N eolithic term in o lo g y; Starčevo in Y u g o sla v ia after the eponym ous site east o f B elgrad e; Koros in southeastern H ungary and Cri§ - the Rom anian name for the same R iv e r K o ro s - in w estern R om ania. This com p lex occupied the drainage area o f the V ard ar and M orava in M acedonia and Southern and central Y ugoslavia and the southeastern part o f the m iddle Danube basin, extending as far as M old avia in eastern R om ania. T o sim plify term in o logy, this cultural bloc w ill be referred to as ‘the Aegean and central Balkan N eolithic’. This N eolithic cuiture left rem arkably hom ogeneous artifacts: bone, Stone and ceramic artifacts, ineluding distinetive painted bow ls and ring-based jars, ali closely resembling each other. W heat, barley, lentils, vetch and peas were cultivated and am ong the domesticated animals, sheep and goat w ere the most num erous, a characteristic feature o f the w arm er and drier conditions o f the A egean and east M editerranean. A lthough the basic econom ic pattern was faithfully transferred from the south to the middle Danubian basin, N eolithic farm ers in northern Y u g o sla v ia , H u n gary and R o m a n ia had to adapt to a som ew hat dam per, m ore heavily forested environm ent: consequently cattle and pig were increasingly exploited b y more northerly settlers, and fishing and hunting usually playeđ a much m ore im portant role. T h e cli.mate was slightly vvarm er and w etter than it is today. ‘T e lls’, created by the accum ulation o f cultural debris, attest the permanence o f these farm ing com m unities on extensive Coastal and inland plains in the A egean area and B ulgaria south o f the Balkan M ountains. Further north, they occur less conspicuously, especially in the upper river valleys o f central Y ugoslavia,

H u n g a ry and R o m a n ia , w h ere the deposit is usually shallow and m ore w idely distributed. This m ay reflect a partially horizontal displacem ent o f settlem ent through tim e, possibly as a result o fse m inomadic agriculture, involving periodic abandonment and reoccupation o f sites. T h e use o f w ood en rather than substantial m ud-brick structures w o u ld also explain the less-marked accum ulation o f midden deposits in the wetter northerly environm ents. M ore than a thousand Proto-Sesklo, Sesklo, Starčevo and K oros (Cri?) sites are recorded, o f w h ich about fifty have been extensively excavated during the course o f the last century. The area o f distribuII don and the nam es o f sites m entioned in the text are indicated in the map. M ost o f the radiocarbon dates for this com plex range from the end o f the seventh to the beginning o f the fifth m illennium BC. E m p loyin g the corrective scale produced b y radiocarbon analyses o f dendrochronologically dated w o od samples these dates w ould yield an approxim ate true age o f 7000-5500/5300 BC. The process o f separating out into regional groups progressed steadily. B y 6000 b c , the Sesklo cuiture o f Thessaly and central Greece was typologically distinct from the artifact assemblages o f the rest o f the central B alkan region. Further north, typical form s o f the Starčevo com p lex persisted into the m iddle o f the sixth m illen nium , fm ally undergoing a rapid transition, most đ early reflected III in ceram ics, to fo rm the V in ca com plex.
Chalcolithic, c. 5500 -3500 b c .
The Vinca sequence is best docum ented at the site o f Vinča itself, 14 km . east o f B elgrade, excavated interm ittently between 1908 and 1932 by M. Vasfc. The stratified m ound yielded about 12 m. o f cultural debris, o f w hich the Vinča remains occupy about 7 m. and the Starčevo, below , a depth o f almost 2 m. N o other site with such vvell-defm ed stradfication has yet been discovered, and it has rem ained the backbone o f the skeletal ch ron ology and ty p o lo g y o f Vinča assemblages. At Vinča alone, almost 2000 figurines were dis covered , b y far the greatest n um ber unearthed at a single site. O ther im portant settlements excavated during the last fifty years are indicated on the map, w here they are seen to cluster around the modem towns o f Belgrade, Vršac-Timi$oara, Cluj, Kragujevac, IV Priština, Kosovska M itrovica, Skopje and Šcip. M an y settlements o f the Chalcolithic period are large, occupying as m uch as t:wenty or m ore acres o f river terrace. T h e houses are o f tw o or three room s and are organized into streets. Vinča sites such as P ločnik, P otporanj, C rn ok alačk a B ara, M ed ved n jak, Selevac, D renovac, G rivac and Valač must have been townships rather than mere villages.

R adiocarbon dates converted to approxim ate true age provide an accurate ch ronological definition o f the southeast European Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultural sequence. This diverges radically from the conservative traditional chronology which maintained that the European N colithic and Chalcolithic encompassed nothing m ore than stagnant cultural backwaters, incapablc o f autonom ous innovation and g ro w th . W hen Professor Vasić first reported the results o f his excavation o f the Vinča m ound in the lllustrated London N ew s in 1930, hc described the site as ‘a centre o f A egean civilization in the second m illennium bc;\ He believed that the settlem ent was continuously occupied from about the beginning o f the M iddle



B ronze A g e in the A egean d ow n to the conquest o f the area b y the R om an s. Finally, shortly bcfore he died he asserted that Vinča was rather a colo n y o f the G reeks, and this suggestion continues to bc cited m some m odern histories o f the Balkans. T h e cuiture was considered m uch too advanced, its art treasures too sophisticated, to be o f N eolithic or Chalcolithic age, some 7000 years old. The calibrated radiocarbon dates obtained from eight sites o f different phases o f the Vinča cuiture (Anza, Predionica, Vinča, M edvednjak, Banjica, Valač, G ornja Tuzla and Divostin) place this cuiture betw ecn 5300 and 4000 BC. T he artistic tradition produced in the late sixth and fifth m illen nium b c in the central B alkan Peninsula is one o f the most rem arkable and distinctive o f European and N ear Eastern
prehistory. T he discovery o f the Tartaria tablets and other signs inscribed on figurines and pots, coupled with evidence o f a marked intensification o f spiritual life in general, has nourished a diffusionist explanation. M any w ould attribute the appearance o f the Vinča com plex to m igration or intensive stim ulus-diffusion from the east, in particular from A natolia. In this context the tablets are believed to have reached the D anube region from M esopotam ia not earlier than about 3000 BC. Despite stratigraphical evidence, typologies, natura! scientific dating techniques, and new excavations indicating strong influences from the east Balkans and not Anatolia, som e archaeologists persist in vievving the Balkan prehistoric cultures as in ferio r; and this, even though most o f them find no marked cultural hiatus between the Starčevo and Vinča com plexcs. The first attcmpts at linear w riting appear not later than the m id-sixth m illennium b c and the Early Vinča inscribed figurines, spindle whorls and other objects are definitcly o f local m anufacture. The much-discussed problem o f the origin o f the black-polished and lightly channdled pottery predom inant am ong the Vinča ceramics can be explained by postulating continuous cultural contact and exchange between the central and eastern B alk an s: the black-polished vvares w ith channelled decoration w ere first m troduced by the N eolithic inhabitants in the M arica valley o f central B ulgaria, during the early phases of K aran ovo. The vvare spread first to M acedonia and subsequently to the central Balkans during the K aran o vo III phase, the true age o f w hich is approxim ately 5400-5300 b c . Despite constant contact with neighbouring cultures Vinca sculptural art rcmained m arkedly distinet from that o f other groups. Indeed, the m ythical im agery, perhaps m ore than anything else, refleets the European roots o f the Vinča coinplex. Dne to intensive com m unication via the prehistoric ‘h ig h w a y ’ o f the R iv e rs Bosna and N eretva connectcd by a narro\v pass o f the D in aric Alps. a cuiture o f the central Balkan background in Bosnia
developed into a separate entity know n as Butmir, thus nam ed after the B u tm ir settlement at Sarajevo, excavated in 18 9 3-9 6 ; it is noted for its spiral-dccorated globular and piriform vases and a significant num ber o f sculptures. T h e B u tm ir cuiture is affiliated with Vinča, but also was strongly influenced by the Adriatic D an ilo-H var and Southern Italian M atera-Serra d ’A lto cultures. T h e k ey site for ch ron ology is O bre II, excavated in 1967-68 b y A . B cn ac and the author. T he site yielded an ideal, uninterrupted four-m etre stratigraphy and a series o f radiocarbon dates. These place the three periods o f the B utm ir civilization betvveen c. 5 10 0 and 4000 b c .
2 THE ADRIATIC ARKA
Neolithic, c. 6500-5500 b c.
The early N eolithic cuiture o f the circum -A d riatic region is know n as the Impresso com plcx, characterized by grit-tem pered wares impressed with cardium shells or finger-nails. The sim ple pottery bow ls ornam ented in this w a y and the farm ing eco n o m y w hich they served are believed to have developed as a result o f difFusion, coupled with m aritim e m ovem ent and trade along th e Adriatic littoral and off-shore islands. The Im presso cuiture o f vvestern Y u go slavia, vvestern G reece and S o u th e rn Italy represents on ly a part o f the w id cly dispersed circum -M editerranean com plex. Impresso sites occupy caves or take the form o f open settlements enclosed by a ditch, and their econom y was based upon dom esti cated sheep and cattle, fishing and hunting, and eultivation o f wheat and barley. T h e material cuiture was poor in ceram ic art and sculpture until the produetion o f n c w form s was stimulated b y contact with central Greece, perhaps the result o f m ore extensive m aritim e activity which is otlierw ise witnessed by the widespread distribution ofobsidian from Lipari, one o f the Aeolian islands north o f S icily, and from Sardinia.
Advanced Neolithic-Chalcolithic, c. 5500 -3500 bc;.
Elaborate ređ-on-cream painted wares appeared in S o u th e rn Italy, m arking the inception ot the Sialoria period. I his in turu \vas succeeded by the Scrra d'Alto period, characterized by baroque handles, ‘fruitstand’ shapes and other com plex ceram ic form s. O11 the Y u g o slav coast, there em erged the Danilo com plex, d o se ly related to B u tm ir, and characterized by geom etrically dccorated painted vvare and zoom orphic cult vases. T h e radiocarbon dates from the earliest Scaloria sites w ith painted w are d u ster around 5500 b c (th eaverage calibrated date is 5550 b c ), and for the sites ofth e advanced stage (Scrra d’ A lto, H var-successor to Danilo) fali vvithin the first h a lf o ft h e fifth m illennium b c .

3 THE M ID D IE D AN U BE BASIN
Neolithic Central European Linear Pottery, Alfold, Tisza and Bukk complexes, c. 5500-4500 b c .
A fully developed N eolithic culture and econom y evolved by about 5500-5000 BC in the M iddle Danube Basin and the foothills o f the Carpathians. T h e earliest N eolithic assemblage representing the Linear Pottery c u ltu r e ('Bandkeramik") o f C en tral E u r o p e and th e related A lfold group in eastern H un gary reveal strong centra! Balkan (Late Starčevo and Early Vinca) influence. Nevertheless, the local robust, tall-statured European o f ‘C ro-M agn on B ’ type, distinguished by a mesocephalic skull and ‘rectangular’ fa c e -a very w idc m andiblc and short, straight nose - continued to occupy the arca, com prising both the M esolithic and N eolithic inhabitants. It seems that the local M esolithic population was gradually converted to an agricultural econom y, fo llo w in g the exam ple o f the farm ers to the south and east. The p ra ctice o f e x te n siv e slash-and-burn a g ric u ltu re in v o lv in g periodic resettlem ent effected the rapid spread o f the N eolithic econom y am o n g the indigenous population from H olland in the west to R o m a n ia in the east. The second stage o f N eo lith ic develop ment is m arked by the appearance o f the Zeliezovce variant west o f the m iddle D anube in H ungary, Slovakia and A ustria, the ‘ m usicnote’ (Notenkopf) decorated pottery phase to the north, and the B u k k culture in the Carpathian foothills. The Tisza com plex, nam ed after the R iv e r Tisza, m ay have developed from the A lfold Early N eolithic and is contem porary to Early Vinca.

architectural and artistic traditions. The Lengyel physical type, the so-called ‘A tlanto-M ediecrran can’, contrasts w ith the ccntral E u ro pcan C ro -M a g n o n , although a closely rclated physical typc is knovvn from central Italy. A nalogies to the L en gyel com plcx w ith its settlements fortified w ith w id e ditches, and its sophisticated painted p irifo rm vases and footed stands, are found in the D anilo com plex along the A driatic coast o f Y u go slavia. This m ay reflect an ethnic infiltration from the A driatic area to the Sava basin and the region east o f the Alps. T h e L cn gyel sites are distributed over a large territory ineluding eastern Austria, ccntral and eastern Czechoslovakia and Southern Poland. The settlements consist o f tw o house types - rectangular tim ber struetures built w ith upright posts and scmi-subterranean dvvellings. These villages were located on large flat terraces and surrounded by fortifications, enormous ditches and palisades with towers. Adjacent to their settlement, the villagers cultivated vvheat, barley and Italian m illet; in addition to tending sheep/goat and kceping dogs they dom esticated both cattle and pig and engaged in hunting. Each o f these anim als also played an im portant part in ritual practices, ju dgin g from the frequent zoom orphic figurines and specially prepared offcring-pits which contained aurochs skulls or dog skeletons. Lengyel scvilpture retained a uniquc identity throughout, and so form s a separate unit in the m osaic o f O ld European art. T h e classical L en gyel cuiture in central Europe began som e tim e in the fifth m illenium b c , its later period cxten d in g into the fourth m illennium b c . The ceram ic sequence for which a painted period with three sub-phases and an unpainted period with tw o sub-phases can be recognized, corroboratcs these w id ely separated dates. T h e Tiszapolgar com p lex in the east H ungarian plain em erged as a successor to the Tisza grou p . It is also referred to as the H ungarian E arly C o p p cr A ge because o f the occurrence o f copper axes, awls and pendants. T h e com p lex derives its name from the cem etery o f Tiszapolgar-Basatan ya in northeastern H u n gary w ith 156 burials near the settlement area. These people o f Mediterranean type buried their dead in shallovv pits in a crouched position accom panied b y large and small vases, copper and shell bead necklaces, copper and gold pendants, flint blades and copper and stone axes. Their ceram ic form s - biconical vases and w ide bovvls 011 pedestals - are generally related to those o f the L en gyd cuiture, but they did not paint their pottery. T h e Bodrof’kereszti'tr o r M iddle C o p p er A ge co m p lex is a continuation o f T iszapolgar and term inated around 3500 b c w ith the infiltration o fth e steppe elem ent and East Balkan refugees. T h e Pctrefti grou p in T ransylvania is contem poraneous and culturally d o s d y related to the K aran ovo and Cueuteni cultures.

T h eir contents p roved to be surprisingly advanced, including tulip-shaped vases with a black or white geom etric design painted on a red slip, one-handled cups, three-legged cult vessels, m arble and clay figurines and a rich bone and stone tool assemblage including num erous mill-stones and sickles o f deer antler with inserted flint blades. Plentiful remains o f einkorn, em m er, wheat and lentils, and bones o f domesticated sheep/goat, cattle and pig confirm the role o f agriculture. A lth o u gh fundam entally related to the central Balkan N eolithic, we have here another distinguishable variant o f southeast European N eolithic culture. T h e highest B u lgarian tells have a stratigraphic depth o f as much as 1 8 m ., com posed o f accum ulated debris from the sixth to the third m illennia b c . T h e stratigraphies defined at the K aran o vo , A zm ak and Kazanlik tells yield an ideal docum entation o f the evolu tion and continuity o f material culture over a long period; the K aranovo scquence, phases I to V I, has becom e universally adopted as a chronological yardstick for the developm ent o f East Balkan civiliza tion during the sixth, fifth and part o f the fourth m illennia BC. A large num ber o f radiocarbon dates from the K aranovo and A zm ak tells, rcpresenting K a ran o vo I—III, form an alm ost perfect sequence; calibrated, they run from the end o f the seventh m illennium to about 5200 bc. T h ere was a considerable inerease in population du ring the K aran ovo III phasc, vvhich must have begun around 5500-5400 b c , whcn elements o f the K aran ovo III assemblage were carried, probably by ethnic expansion, northwest into the low er Danube region and southward beyond the R h o d o p e M ountains to M acedonia and T h race. In the north the intruders had to confront the settlers o f the Central European Linear Pottcry culture, w ho occupicd the low er D anube and the H am angia group on the B lack Sca coast.
Chalcolithic, c. 5200/5000-3500 b c . T h e East Balkan C halcolithic is com posed o f tw o diffcrcnt cultures: H am angia on the B lack Sca coast, and M arica-B oian-G um clni^a in R om ania, Bulgaria and northeastern Greece.

were carđium -im pressed. O rnam ents, found abundantly as grave goods, include huge bracelets and beads o f Spondylus shell. A round the m iddle o f the fifth m illennium the H am angian com plex was superseded b y the G u m eln ip civilization. T he Marica com plex represents th e S o u th ern branch o f th e East Balkan civilization, named after th e R iv e r M arica in ccntral Bulgaria. T h e Boian tradition is a northern variant o f the East Balkan civilization. It is named after an island settlem ent in the Danube south o f Bucharest. D u rin g its second (Giule§ti) phase, B oian material cuiture spread as far as M oldavia in the northeast. Skeletons from a large B oian cem etery at Cernica near Bucharest were predom inantly o f small-statured Mediterranean type. T h e name 'Vadastra civilization ’, derived from a m iddle layer o f the stratified site on the Danube in w estern R o m a n ia , is not a separate cuiture but a w estem variant o f the East Balkan civilization parallel to the B oian tradition. The M arica, Vadastra and Boian groups are not different cultures but integral parts o f one civilization, which in its advanced stage and clim ax is k n o w n as the Cum elnija civilization. A t least five hundred tells containing Gum elnita material remains have been recorded in R o m a n ia , B ulgaria and eastern M acedonia, o f which about thirty have been systematically excavated. The Gum elnita site itself lies southeast o f Bucharest on the Danube and was excavated between 1924 and 1960. O ther im portant sites from Gum elnita deposits are Cascioarele, Sultana, Vidra, T angiru and Hir§ova, ali in the lo w er Danube region o f R o m a n ia , and R u se , Chotnica and Kodjaderm en in northern B ulgaria. In the M arica V alley, in addition to A zm ak and K aran ovo (VI), know n sites cluster around Stara Z ago ra and P lovd iv. N orth o f the A egean, the m ost notew orthy are the reccntly excavatcd Sitagroi and D ikili-Tash m ounds on the Plain o f D ram a. Sedentary Gumelnita communities occupicd compact villages or small townships for a millennium or more, producing deep accum ulations o f cultural deposit, rich in artifacts. The subsistencc econom y depended upon the usual crops and dom esticates - w hcat, six-ro w barley, vetch and lentils; and cattle, pig, shcep/goat and dog. There was a steady grow th in m etal-produetion and trade: copper ncedles, awls, fish-hooks and spiral-hcaded pins w erc produced and, at the end o f the period, axes and daggers, a d evelopm ent which is also found in the Vinča, T iszapolgar, Lengyel and Cucuteni cultures. W orkshops o f flint, copper, gold, SpondyIus shell and pottery have been diseovered, im plying craft-specialization and general division o f labour. Gold was obtained from Transylvania and copper from Carpathian sources. G um elnita fine ceramic vessels are distinguished by the manner in w hich colour and decorative patterns are blendeđ vvith exquisite
form s, clear evidence o f an advanced technique. G raphite painting, which becam e the dom inant me.thod o f decoration, required special kilns to provid e the prolonged period o f reduetion necessary to prevent oxidation o f the graphite. Shapes range from large decorated storage vessels for grain to cups, profiled dishes, biconical or piriform bowls and amphorae and highly stylized anthropom orphic, zoomorphic and ornithom orphic forms. Schem atism is a characteristic o f ali East Balkan sculptural art. D uring the Boian phase, figurine form was bound by rigid conventions, which w ere subsequently relaxed to perm it the inereased freedom and versatility displayed by Gum elnita figurines. Lincar signs (possibly w riting) w ere cm ployed by the East B alkan B oian Gum elni(a civilization throughout its existence.
5 THE MOLDAVlAN-WUS'r UKRAINIAN ARHA
Neolithic, c. 6 500-5000 b c .
D uring the B oreal and Atlantic clim atic phases, the black soil region northvvest o f the Black Sca, intersected by the fertile valleys o f the Prut, Siret, Dniester and S ou th ern Bug, offered a suitable environment for the inception and developm ent o f a Neolithic econom y. The Dnicster-Biig Neolithic c u itu re , com prising permanent villagc settlements based on agriculture, developed indigenously and was only subsequently influenced from the south and west, in the sixth m illennium b c by the Central Balkan (Starčevo) com plex, and in the fifth by the East Balkan (Boian) and Central European (Lincar Pottery) com plexes. The uninterrupted cultural continuum is ideally defined by stratigraphic and typological studies, reinforced by radio carbon dates, which reveal a D niester-Bug sequence ofthree aceramic and five ceram ic phases.
Chalcolithic, c. 5000-3500 b c .
The N eolithic cuiture \vas succecdcd by the tw elve consecutive phases o f the Chalcolithic Ciiciitcni (Russian : Tripol civilization. Subsistencc was based upon the cultivation o f cinkom whcat, domestication o f cattle and pig, and intensive hunting o f forest fauna and fishing. H ovvcvcr, the forest environm cnt made shifting agricul ture neccssary and conscqucntly there was 110 accum ulatioii o f mound deposits such as are found in Bulgaria and Southern R o m a n ia .

T he Cucuteni civilization is clearly affiliated w ith its Southern neighbours o f the East Balkan tradition, and form s the northerly outpost o f O ld European culture, extending as far as the m iddle Vili D nieper in the northeast. Ethnically, it appears to have com prised a m edley o f the indigenous inhabitants and infiltrating M editerraneans. Southwestern and East Balkan influences played an im portant part in transform ing local ceram ic styles, both at the inception and during the evolution o f C ucuteni culture, w hich in its classical period, around 4500-4000 b c , achieved a rem arkable artistic m aturity in its ceram ic products. Characteristic o f the Cucuteni peoples are their colourful bichrom e and trichrom e vases, bow ls, ladles, and other pottery form s; equally distinctive are libation ju gs, vessels for divination, altars and schem atic anthropom orphic and zoom orphic figurines, vvhich reveal an adherence to elaborate ritual practices. Pictorial representations on Late Cucuteni vases are o f utmost im portancc as a source o f m ythical im agery.

2 Schematism
Sh o rth and
In the earliest level o f the Vinča m ound, representing the N eo lith ic Starčevo com plex, a ceram ic figurine usually described as a ‘seated goddess with large buttocks and cylindrical neck’ was found. For a fem ale representation it has an extrem ely reduced form , w ith no distinetion between head and torso, and only a cylindrical neck . adjoining the buttocks. Its general shape suggests a bird but there is no indication o f w ings, beak or bird-legs. Even as a hybrid, perhaps h alf-w om an and half-bird, it needlessly lacks naturalistic detail. This means that w e are confronted with the problem ofd eterm in ing the artist’s ultim atc intention. In the first place w e m ust decide w hat the sculpture presents, its subject m atter; beyond this, w e must also try to understand its sym bolic content, for on ly in this w a y can w e hope to com prehend the psycho-social dynam ic that inspired its produetion. Stratigraphical evidence shows that this figurine dates from ro u gh ly 6000 b c , and there are m any like it in sites o f the same period. Som e figurines are even m ore reduced, rendering the merest outline o f hum an or bird form . E xcavation o f N eolithic sites has yielded num erous ‘ bu m py’ figurines, often little m ore than tw o ccntimetrcs long, w hich archaeologists classify only as indeterm inate or am biguous objeets. Exam in ed as isolated, individual pieces they rem ain enigm atic, their role unknovvn; but once w e identify these m iniatures as belon ging to a single hom ogencous grotip o f figures, thev can be recognized as vastly reduced versions o f the larger ‘steatop y g o u s’ figurine-type w hich w ill be fully described in later ehapters. W ith these and m any larger figures lacking in detail, it is evident that the sculptor was not striving for aesthetic effects; he was producing sculptural ‘shorthand’ , an abstract sym bolic conceptual art, im ages that were em blem atic o fth e divine regardless o f the cxtent o f their sehematization. T h e true m eaning o f the figures can best be

sought in the m ore detailed, less abstracted figurines w h ich reveal the naturalistic detail that betrays subject m atter and so brings us closer to understanding the content o f the w o rk. Sculptural ‘shorthand’, unthinking and repetitive, illustrates the conservative nature o f the tradition within which the sculptor w o rk e d ; each culture translates its basic explanatory assum ptions into equivalent fo rm structures and creativity is on ly expressed in subtle variations from the socially prescribed norms. For the sociocultural historian it is m ore im portant to exam ine the conventional than the fe w and slight deviations from it, since his w o rk is to com prehend the inherited and collective - rather than the individual - psyche.
T he N eolithic artist’s reality - n o t a ph ysical reality
B oth figurine subject matter and the form al repetition o f the collectiv ely approved style give an insight into the content and purpose o f figurine art. A rt reveals m an’s mental response to his environm ent, for w ith it he attempts to interpret and subdue reality, to rationalize nature and give visual expression to his m yth olo gizin g explan ato ry concepts. The chaotic form s o f nature, including the human form , are disciplined. W h ile the C y cla d ic figurines o f the third m illenniiim BC are the most extrem ely geom etricized, rigid constraint o f this kind, though less m arked, characterizes m ost o f the groups o f O ld European N eolithic and C halcolithic figures. T h e artist’s reality is not a physical reality, though he endow s the concept w ith a physical form , w h ich is tw o-dim ensional, constrained and repetitive. Su pernatural pow ers w ere conceived as an explanatory device to induce an ordered experience o f nature’s irregularities. These powers w ere given fo rm as masks, h yb rid figures and animals, prod u cing a sym bolic, conceptual art not given to physical naturalism. The p rim ary purpose was to transform and spiritualize the body and to surpass the elem entary and corporeal. It follow s, then, that form al reduction should not be ascribed to the technical inability o f the N eolithic artist to m odel in the round but to requircments dictated by deeply implanted concepts and beliefs. N evertheless, since w e are dealing w ith an art that has often been term ed ‘p rim itive’ in a partially pejorative scnse, it is necessary to digress briefly in defence o f the N eolithic sculptor’s ability and to stress that he w as not lim ited to unnaturalistic form s b y the inadequacy o f his m anual skills, the nature o f his raw m aterials o r the lack o f neccssary tcchniqucs. In short, old European figurine art was the outeom e o f skilled craftsmanship, conform ing to matured traditions. T h e . beginnings o f p ottery m anufacture are blurred in the

archaeological record, fo r the earliest clay vessels and artifacts w ere unbaked and have not survived. T h e earliest fired ceramics, includ ing fine burnished and painted wares from the late seventh m illennium B C, are articulately m odelled and reveal a complete mastery o f ceramic technology. Stone and bone was fmely carved and ground: Proto-Sesklo and Starčevo villagers in the A egean area and centra! Balkans fashioned beautiful spoons o f bone and painstakingly ground miniature stone ornam ents such as perforated pendants and buttons. T he serpentine toad from the site o f N ea N ikom edeia in M acedonia is an outstanding w o rk o f art o f the seventh m illennium b c . 171 Stone and bone sculptures are few compared to those o f clay, but they show a like degree ofstylization, though one m ight expect them to be, i f anything, m ore schematic still. T w o sculptures have been seleeted to dem onstrate this: a typical Early Vinča clay figu rin e w ith a triangular masked head, bum p for a nose, slanting incised eyes, stum p-arm s, projeeting buttocksandnaturalistically m odelledbreasts 3, 4 and navel; and the m arble figurine from Gradac, also o f the E arly 5 Vinča period. The different raw materials do dictate a differing expression but the figures are alike in style and detail. B o th com prise masked heads, arm stumps and inarticuiate Iegs. O ther m arble sculptures are still m ore reduced, lacking ali facial features. D urin g the fifth m illennium , carvin g in m arble became m ore self-conscious and em ancipated itself fro m the influence o f clay-m od ellin g. B on e figures w ere entirely schematic. A fifth-m illennium exam ple o f a stylized human figure carved out o f bone from a grave in the cem etery o f C ernica near Bucharest is a case in point. Its head is 6 broken. The tw o rounded protuberances apparently portray folded arms. T h e abdom inal and pubic area is emphasized. A lth o u gh drastically reduced, this little sculpture is probably a p ortrayal o f a Great Goddess in a rigid position, standing in the nude w ith folded arms, a type encountered in graves throughout the O ld European period and in the C yclad es o f the third m illennium b c . A lm o st ali o f the knovvn figurines o f copper and gold are schematic, tw o dim ensional silhouettes o f the human body, cut from a flat piece o f material. T h roughout the seventh and sixth millennia b c figurine art was clearly dom inated b y abstract form s such as cylindrical p illar-like neeks and a hybrid torso o f female buttocks and a bird’s body, but at the same time other quite different form s were produced, som e o f them strikingly naturalistic. An exceptional female figurine assigned to the Sesklo period in Thessaly sits in a relaxcd position w ith her legs to one side, her hands resting on her thighs. In profile the nose is 7,8 exaggerated and beaked but the head and body are naturalistically proportioned, dispensing with the pillar-like neck o f earlier sculptures.

T h e gradual trend tow ard m ore naturalistic sculpture can be traced in the Vinča statuary. The Vinča m ound and other Vinča settlements p rovid e a large group o f figurines com bining sehematization o f the upper part o f the body w ith almost naturalistic m odelling below . A sculpture fro m Selevac in centra! Y u go slav ia provides a classic exam ple in this series: the figure has exquisitely m odelled abdom en and hips, the legs m erging to provid e a stable base. T h e head is 9 schematized, pentagonal, with sem i-globular plastic eyes; the arms are represented b y perforated stumps. O ne o f the most exquisite sculptures fro m the Vinča site is a perfectly proportioned squatting 10 w om an, unfortunately headless. A nother rem arkable Vinča sculp ture, also headless, from the site o f Fafos, depiets a man w ith knees d raw n tigh tly to his chest, his hands placed on them and his back bent slightly forvvard. His life-like posture, w ith the exceptionally 1 1 ,1 2 accurate m odelling o f the arms and the hands tightly grasping the knees, is unique in European art o f c. 5000 b c . A n exquisite rendering o f the rounded parts o f a fem ale body, especially abdom en and buttocks, occurs occasionally in ali parts o f O ld Europe. A n extraordinary series o f m ale sculptures, each ind ivid u ally seated 011 a stool, is distinguished for perfeetion in portrayal o f the m ale body, particularly the slightly cu rvin g back. 246 , 2 4 8 -2 5 0 T h e excavation o f the B u tm ir site yielded several finely executed heads, rem arkable for their realism ; the conventional m asked features are here replaced by a well-m odelled forehead, eye-brow s, nose, lips, ehin and ears. U nm asked hum an heads m odelled in the round occasionally occur in other cultural gro u p s; even in the Cucuteni area, in w hich figurine art reached an extrem e o f schem atic sym bolism , a few naturalistically rendered human heads were discovered, with eyes, nostrils and mouth shown by impressed holes. Figurines with unmasked heads and human facial features comprise the rarest category o f N eolithic and Chalcolithic sculptures. T h e finest sculpture was certainly the produet o f exceptionally gifted m em bers o f society, though the varying intensity o f individual m otivation w ould also bc refleeted in the quality o f the artifact. N evertheless the eruder figurines which w ere the norm w ere no less rich in sym bolic content.

D e c o r a t iv e m o t if s o n f ig u r in e s a s r e f l e c t io n o f COSTUM E AND
ORNAMENTS
D ecorative m otifs frequently occur on figurines to indicate costume, refleeting the stylistic conventions and characteristics o f dress within the sculptor’s society. Late V inča figurines teli us m ost about costum e design since they are less abstract than earlier N eolithic figurines and less conventionalized than those o f the East Balkan and Cucuteni civilizations. T h e ir careful detail, reinforced b y less substantial evidence from East Balkan (Gumelni^a) sculpture, enables us to reconstruct O ld European dress style c. 4000 b c . T h e usual decorative technique was deep incision, often enerusted w ith a w h ite paste m ade o f erushed shells, or filled w ith red ochre, or black, white or red paint. Alternating dark and light bands, set either d iagonally or vertically, w ere som etim es produced b y this m ethod, probably to depict a garm ent made o f several broad, different coloured panels o f material sewn together. Plastic relief decoration was also em ployed. Applied ‘buttons’ arranged in one, tw o or three row s indicatc belts, medallions and necklaces. Both m en and w o m cn w o re a circular pendant hanging in the m iddle o f the chest or at the nape o f the neck. It m ay have been an em blem signifying particular status, or m ore spccifically sym bolic o f go d desses or gods. T h e first indications o f necklaces on fem ale figurines are to be traced on the prim itive cylindrical Starčevo figurines. Actual shell, clay, stonc and bone hcads have been frequently found: in the N eolithic settlem ent o f Vrsnik, near Štip, Y u go slavia, hundreds o f shell beads w ere deposited in a small globular black polished vasc. N um erous beads o f shell, alabaster, m arble, copper and clay w ere recovered from the sites o f C h alcolithic V inča, B u tm ir, L en gyel, East Balkan, Cucuteni and other cultural groups. Several strings o f beads frcquently appear on Cucuteni figurines.
44
H ip-belts
M ost captivating are the hip-belts, which have a large button resting on either hip and a third in front o f the pubis. The belts w ere probably fashioned in leather, although som e w ere apparently m ade o f large beads or clay dises. T h e large buttons m ay have been m anufactured o f bone, w ood, clay or stone. M ushroom-shaped buttons o f white, green or yellow m arble, alabaster and calcite, diseovered in Vinča settlements, m ay have served as studs for belts, jackets or other garm ents o f heavy fabric. Figurines vvearing large buttons on the hips have been diseovered in the deepest layer o f the Vinča m ound, belonging to the N eolithic Starčevo period, and they continued to be represented in sculpture until the final phase o f occupation at the V inča site. H ip-belts are also portrayed on East Balkan figurines. Fem ale figurines vvearing hip-belts appear to be otherwise naked, except for the usual facial masks.
D resses
T h e incised decoration o f some figurines indicates long, elegant go w n s. T h e y m ust have been w ell-fitted to the fem ale b o d y, narrovvin g at the waist and at the bottom . Breasts, buttocks and legs are w elldefined in m ost sculptures, as i f the dress w ere o f light fabric. C o m monest are tw o-piece dresses, consisting o f skirt and blouse. The m ajority o f the ‘ clothed’ figurines have incised m arkings suggesting a blouse o f six or m ore equal panels o f material sewn together. It has a sim ple ‘V ’ neck at front and back and m ay be sleeveless, shortsleeved or long-sleeved. The blouse or bolero norm ally extends just b e lo w the vvaist, but seated figurines w ear blouses or jerk in s extending dow n to the stool or throne. A suggestion o f decorated sleeves appears on some o f the most impressive figurines, perhaps im plying the portrayal o f richly clad goddesses. A b o vc the shoulders a spiral m o tif is usually encountered, and below it three or m ore parallel incisions. T h e B ariljevo seated goddess has a shoulder and sleeve decoration o f spirals and tvvo groups o f lines. The constricting lincs across the m iddle o f the arm s and at the wrists o f this figure m ay represent arm -rings and bracelets. A similar constriction appears on the arm o f the sculpturc from Ć uprija, but this figure is uniquc for another reason: it bears upon its back what appears to be a bag, perhaps a leather pouch for carrying a baby. The bag is suspended o v er the shoulders and neck b y a massive belt or ropc vvhich is clearly indicated b y an incised applied ridge. Dress fashions show considerable divcrsity, and various fabrics and perhaps em broidcry can be inferrcd from the differing zigzag, ladder and net patterns which adom the blouses.

A n apron 9 w as som etim es w o rn o ver the skirt, w ith a fringe or tassels indicated around the apron sides and at the back. As a rule, Vinča, Gumclni^a and Cucuteni figurines wear hip-belts, sometimes supported by S shoulder straps and frin ged at the front, back and sides. T h e long skirt usually reaches to the tocs but in a num ber o f figurines legs and fcet are visiblc, either naturalistically portrayed or vvith indications o f cloth covcrin g. C lear definition o f breast and 20 navel suggests that the seated figure from Čaršija wcars no clothing ab ove the v^aist.

The figurc’s fat legs scem to be bound, perhaps with thongs or woven bands, but are probably otherwise bare. O ther figurines clearly reveal draped cloth and vvrappings around the legs and the skirt was possibly slit b elow the knees and fastened with w oven bands, ribbons or thongs.

COIFFURE AND CAPS
A lth o u gh the face is certainly masked on a m ajority o f the figurines, long free-hanging hair falling d o w n the back to ju st belo w the shoulders is often evident behind the mask. L on g hair, carefullv indicated even on the schematizcd exam ples, characterizes the cylindrical figurine heads o f the seventh and sixth m illennium b c , and special attention to coiffure persisted throughout the duration o f the Vinča cuiture. A masked head from Vinča itsclfshow s the hair divided into tw o sym m etrical panels by a central ribbon, attached, at back and front, to a second ribbon that passes around the cro w n o f the head, disappcaring at the back vvherc it is overh u n g by hair. This hair-style, interpretcd as ‘p lu m age’ b y Vasić, is indicated b y incision. M any o f the later Vinča figurines indicate hair very ncatly com bcd, parted and cut, descending to bclow the cars. Som e have a band around the crow n o f the head. A catcgory o f Cucuteni nude or seminude fem ale figurines has ‘ p o n y-tails’ vvhich fali to the vvaist-line and end in a large bun. East Balkan m iniature sculptures indicate very
elab o rate coiffures consisting o f double-spiral coils round the head. Some figures, male and female, wear peculiar conical caps, hoods or p o in ted coifs, vvhich are decoratcd with rad ial incisions and extend o v e r the mask. T he most celebrated o f such figurines, w earing a tiered conical cap, is the little man (or w om an ) from the site o f V inča. P o in te d c a p s .m ust have been w id cly in fashion during the sixth and fifth m ille n n iu m b c throughout southeastern Europe. E la b o ra te c o i f f u r e and crow n or turban appears only on B ird and Snake Goddess figurines.
SUMMING UP The costume detail preserved on clay figurines attcsts a particular richness in the style and ornam ent o f fem ale and male garm ents during the fifth and early fourth millennia b c . Com parable indication o f dress on figurines o f the seventh and sixth m illennia b c is rare, but sufficient to affirm the presence o f hair-styles, hair ornam ent, bead necklaces, pendant medallions and hip-belts. In the fem ale costum e o f the Vinča and East Balkan cultures several dress com binations rećur persistently: fully dressed figures wear blouses and tight skirts, or long dresses, and possibly boleros; the others w ear either skirts vvhich hug the hips or hip-belts supportingaprons or a longskirt-like fringe, leaving thenavel and upper half o f the torso exposed. Lon g, tight and rich ly ornam ented skirts are characteristic o f ali cultural groups. A t least tw o form s o f attire are discernible on male figurines: some are dressed in decoratcd blouses w ith trousers extcnding below the knees, vvhile others vvear only belts or shorts and chest bands. The men’s blouses charactcristically display broad V-shaped collars. Necklaces, exclusive to female costume, vvere strung with beads o f M editerranean or Adriatic shell, stone, bone, copper or clay; equally popular vvere clav pendants, and arm -rings and bracelets o f shell, bone and copper, w o m by botli m ale and fem ale figurines. The richly clad figurines are probably not meant to depict ordinary villagers; they are more likely to personify specific god desses o r gods, or represent vvorshippers or priests attending rites, garbed appropriately in masks and festive costum e. M uch that typifies costumes vvorn during the fifth and fourth millennia in Balkan Europe can bc readily recognized in the illustrations o f goddesses and vvorshippers preserved on Minoan frcscoes, statuary, seals and signet rings o f the second m illennium b c . The exquisite Minoan female costume m ay represent the culmination o f a tradition vvhich began in N eo lith ic-C h alcolith ic Europe. Like the sculptured deities or vvorshippers o f their Balkan predecessors, the M inoan goddesses and their votaries alw ays vvear lavishly decoratcd skirts o f various designs and colours.

in both periods and so w ere necklaces and arm -rings. W ide-open blouses and bolero-shaped jackets, typical and distinctive in M inoan fem ale dress, had been w orn by Vinča and East Balkan wom en. Individuals h aving im portant roles in ritual celebrations and dressed as goddesses and gods w ere the m ost extravagan tly clad in both periods. H o w ever, som e difference can be n o ted : where the M inoan skirt was flounced, that o f the Balkan N eolithic-C halcolithic was
close-fitting. Essentially the same tradition continued from the B ronze A g e to the tim e o f classical Greece. O n vases o f the sixth and fifth centuries BC gods appear in sleeved decorative robes; D ionysus wears one on b lack-figu re vases and so does A n d rom ed a on a krater o f the fifth century B C , although sleeved robes had becom e unfashionable by that time (Bieber 19 39: Figs. 43,63). M inoan, M ycenaean and ancient G reek festival attire is an inheritance from the O ld European civiliza tion. T h e parallelism is striking. W hat was the origin o f the exquisite O ld European costume? T h ere is no reason to assume that this surprising sophistication o f c. 5000-3500 b c was an im ported elem ent, stim ulated b y A natolianEast M editerranean fashions: like the Vinča and East Balkan script and ceramic designs, O ld European costume design developed within a local tradition. T his is not to say that Europe was culturally isolated from the Anatolian-M editerranean w orld, for generalized stylistic similarities im ply intermittent cultural contact and exchange. O n ly lim ited com parison is possible between the costume o f O ld Europe and other parts o f the civilized w orld - Anatolia, M esopo tam ia, Syro-Palestine and E g y p t - because now here else w ere garments so frequently illustrated on figurines before 4000 BC. A few M esopotam ian figurines, dating from the H a la f and U baid periods o f the fifth and fourth m illennia, display necklaces, belts or short skirts and chest bands (Dales 19 6 3: 2 1), which are analogous to typical Balkan attire. D urin g the seventh and sixth millennia b c there was a m arked resemblance betvveen European and Anatolian ceramic produets, including figurine art and its associated costum e fashions. M ost o f the figurines o f this period from Catal H iiyu k and H acilar in Central A natolia are portrayed nude, but in H acilar som e vvear shorts or belts w ith aprons at front and back (M ellaart 1960: Figs. 6, 9 - 1 1 , and 14), w hilc others appear to w ear blouses or dresscs indicatcd by vertical and horizontal painted lines, display elaborate hair-styles, and wear conical caps (Mellaart 1960: Figs. 13 and 18).

4 The Mask
N o n - h u m a n v isa g e
The mask v/as not invented b y the earliest agriculturists; it is as old and as universal as art and religion. N eolithic m an fo llo w eđ a tradi tion established by his Palaeolithic forebears, adapting the mask to his ow n modes o f ritual and artistic expression. Each o f the cultural groups ineluded in this study possesses a characteristic style o f figurine art, and com m on to each style is the portrayal o f masked faces devoid o f realistic facial features. Cucuteni art evidences little interest in the hum an head. E arly Cucuteni figurine heads are disproportionately small and schematic in relation to the b o d y, and later becom e almost disc-shaped, with two large eyes, or frequently - on male figurines - only a single eye. The eyes, holes pierced through from the back o f the head, are the only indication o f facial features; there is no m outh. T h e un ifo rm ity o f this figurine type, found w id ely distributed o v er the western U kraine and east R o m a n ia , suggests that enduring conventions, rooted in popular rcligious beliefs, dictated aesthetic values. The heads ofE ast Balkan figurines are typically either beaked and narrow or unnaturally broad, with large noses and perforations in the m outh and car arcas for attachments. T o us they appear unfam iliar, even u g ly (cf. Pl. 207), presenting an uncom fortably non-human visage suggestive o f a mask.
T he V in č a m ask
The Vinča artist attached particular im portance to the mask and it is the distinctive and unusual features o f his sculptural masks that render V inča statuary so uniquc. T h e Vinča figures, m odelled less schematically and displaying a greater variety o f form s than their East Balkan, M iddle Danubian or Adriatic counterparts, are the key to the interpretation o f Balkan N eolithic-C halcolithic-sculptures.

Vinča figurines are dem onstrably m asked; on m an y o f them the m ask is clearly outlined, its angular projections extending clear o fth e face w h ich it conceals. It is this evidence, supplied b y the detailed three-dim ensional m od elling o f the V inča heads, w hich sustains the m ore equivocal assertion that the schematic East Balkan and C ucu teni figurines are also masked. In v e ry fe w o fth e V inča figures is the face depieted in the round: most conform to a stylized facial representation which clearly suggests a m ask. T h e evidence for this being strictly form al, the purpose o f this ehapter is to display the range o f variation o f the masks and to delineate their form al evolution within the life-span o f V inča art and o fits ancestry. It is alm ost unbelievable that during the thirty or m ore years in which essays treating Vinča art have appeared, there has been no sustained reference to the m ask, its m ost captivating elem ent. T he contours o f the m ask are evident in profile v iew o f m an y o f the 26, 27 better preserved heads. The facial triangularity or pentagonality, or the protruding angular ‘cheek-bones’ have been rem arked by Vasić, Srejovič and others, but that this points to a mask and the dom inant part it played has on ly been acknovvledged incidentally. S re jo v ič (1965 : 35) ascribed the flat decorative faces o f the Vinča figurines to a trend tow ards stylization': ‘The elaborate ornamental patterns and shading had to com pensate visually the loss o f the threedim ensional, sculptural representation o f the human figu re.’ But there w as no need o f ‘com pensation’ in this sense, for the Vinča artist was am p ly capable o f producing fine sculpture in the round. It is in these figures that the elaborated mask representation reaches its most com plex and dramatic form . T h e Vinča artist was clearly not m otivated to show individualized facial features. Nevertheless there does exist a variety o f so-called ‘naturalistic’ heads, some o f vvhich show neatly com bed hair and ‘d ream y’ half-closed eyes. D o these nonconform ing examples represent realistic facial m odelling, vvithout the im position o f a mask? O ne o f the best k n o w n and most naturalistic am on g them is the ‘little man o f V in ča’ , vvearing a conical cap. His face is vveli-proportioned, with fully detailed facial features. Hovvever, vievved from the back even this exceptional figure rcveals an unnatural protrusion o f the ‘cheek-bones’ : it too m ay bc m asked, despite the appealing h u m anity o f its features. O ther sim ilar small figurines portrayin g men w ith pointed heads, wearing caps or hoods, are clearly masked. T h e same is truc o f the distinctive, exccptionally w ell-m odelled heads found in the K o so v o M etohije province near Priština, produets o f the Late Vinča period. O ne o f the m ost aesthetically pleasing is the head from Fafos. A n o th er exam plc is the head from Predionica, near Priština: its hair is indicatcd, the eycs are ‘ cortce-bean’ shaped. The
60
' massiveness o f the nose, dom inating the face, gives a false im pression fc 0fm ascu lin ity, the coiffure being that o f a w o m an . O ne is struck by the uncom prom ising lines o f the ja w : dom inated b y the nose, the low er part o f the face is truncated im m ed iately b elow it, lackin g any indication o f a mouth. The cheek-bones and ehin project unnaturally. A head fro m C rnokalaćka Bara is rendered w ith sem icircular plastic eyes, large nose and sculpted hair. The clear dem arcation o f forehead and hair, the stylized spiraliform ears and the row s o f stabbed im pressions, w hich m ay have facilitated some sort o f attachm ent, ali im ply that this is a masked head. The spiral o f the ear is an extension o f the facial mask. A nim al masks w ith horns or ears from the Vinča culture are exquisitely stylized.
E v o l u t io n o f th e V in č a m a sk
In the N eo lith ic period masks w ere m odelled in re lie f on cvlindrical figurines or upon the neeks o f large vases. C ylin d rical P roto-Sesklo, Sesklo and Starčevo figurines vvearing clearly defined masks are knovvn from . the sites in eastern and vvestern Thessaly and from Yugoslavia. T h ey are diamond-shaped, oval or roughly triangular with the low er part rounded. One o f the finest exam ples o f a mask m odelled in relief on a vase vvas unearthed at the Starčevo settlem ent at Gladnice in Southern Y u go slavia. A cylindrical sanctuary idol from Porod in , southvvestern Y u go slavia, vvears an im pressive beaked mask w ith huge sem i-spherical eyes, m odelled in relief. These form s suggest that the masked design vvas an early tradition o f southeastem Europe vvhich vvas sustained through the m illennia, and integral vvith the spiritual foundations o f the society it nourished. In the m id-V inča period (7-5~<5 m. deep in the Vinča mound) the masks becom e pentagonal, ineorporating the characterisdcally protruding angular ‘cheek-bones’, a long and more clearlv defined nose and huge inciscd or raised sem icircular cyes vvith bovv-shaped brovv-ridges. The pentagon or broad triangle remained the basic facial outline throughout the Late Vinča period. Som e masks, dominated b y large, slanting scm i-sphcrical eycs vvith a border o f cxaggerated lashes, incised and vvhite-cncrusted, give an impression. o f ‘all-seeingness’. O thers, vvith apparently half-closed or closcd eycs and no indication o f eye-lashes exprcss a pensive or dream y mood. A t its culm ination Vinča art applied a pictorial m ethod to its sculpture, and masks acquircd an extravagant appearancc dne to the arbitrary im position o f an inorganic cxpression. D ccoration took the form o f incision and painting and the ornam entation o f masks becam e a pursuit vvith its ovvn artistic interest, independent o f the sculptural presentation o f the mask.

surfaces dictated the modelled form , and masks consequently assumed the shapes o f very broad triangles, or peaked ovals or lozenges. T his d evelopm ent is evident in masks found at the sites o f Valač and Predionica, located in K osovo M etohije, Southern Y u g o sla v ia . A lm o n d - or egg-shaped slanted eyes ty p ify this series o f masks o f the Late Vinča cuiture, and the diam ond shape replaces the pentagonal. M an y o f these picces have a strictly geom etric ornam entation, usually striations, diagonal incisions, w ith the mask divided into equal sections by the centrally placed line o f the eyes. Vertically-striated triangles above the eyes and several deep whiteinfilled incisions belo w the eyes replace the long lashes o f the other masks. T his m o tif p robably derived from an ideographic m arking. T h e m ost striking sculptures, sym b olizing the ultim atc developm ent o f Vinča art, are the m onum ental, almost life-size heads from Predionica, each wearing a mask ornamented with large, ellipticalshaped eyes. T h e ornam ental design and the peaked, striated triangles and incised diagonal lines above and below the eyes relate them closely to the type discussed above. B ut these faces are better proportion ed ; like the best o f m odern sculpture they give an im pression o f m onum ental solidity. The w idening o f the mask follow s the slanting line o f the eyes, w h ile its projeetion at the eye corners is suggestive o f ears. Was it the sculptor’s intention to p ortray on the mask an animai or half-anim al, half-hum an creature? Though we cannot know for certain, w e feel that the creature is endow ed with an aw e-inspiring p ow er, the ve ry essence o f the significance o f the mask - a proposition w hich w ill be discussed in later ehapters. It w ill bc seen, then, that the Vinča masks can be subdivided into five main d evelopm ental stages: i. R o u g h ly triangular, belonging to the Starčevo and earliest Vinča periods (appearing from a depth o f 9 .3-8 .3 m . in the Vinča m ound). ii. T rian gu lar, belon ging to the E arly V inča period (as high as 7.3 m. in the Vinča m ound). iii. U n decorated pentagonal, typical o f the m iddle phase o f Vinča develop m ent (from c. 7 - 5 m . deep at Vinča). iv. D evelop ed pentagonal, w ith large, raised sem icircular eyes; ornam ented (5-3 m . deep at V inča). v. Pictorial w ith alm ond-shaped eyes (sce Fig. 19).

Frequently occurring perforations o f the mask and a flattencd crow n o f the head im ply that the figurines carried some sort o f organic attachm ent which has not survived. Plumes, fruits, flowers, w ovcn bands and other m aterials couid have been em ployed in this w ay, and w c m ay legitim ately try to im agine these sculptures colourfully adorned w ith elaborate crovvns. In fact, on a few figurines there is a suggestion o f a crovvn or halo. Since a m ajori ty o fth e Vinča masks

appear to im itate bird-like features, the em p loym en t o f p lum age as decoration w ould not be unnatural. Ethnographic data from the Balkan Peninsula lend support to this assum ption, fo r even today masks used for annual festivals are decorated w ith plum es. In contemporary western Bulgaria, for instance, bird masks have very elaborate crovvns o f colourful plum age, w hile other masks bear rams’ or bulls’ horns. M inoan figurine masks are cro w n ed vvith birds, horns, poppies, pom egranates, or even snakes w ith their heads projeeting above the crovvn (ej. bell-shaped idols from G azi, K arfi and G o rty n a : A lexio u 1958, Pl. E -H ). T h e decoration o f masks must have varied considerably depending on vvhat kind o f divinities, devotees, or animals vvere represented. It is possible that som e masks served m ultiple purposes, the transformations being effected by varying decoration. A head-dress could easily be fashioned for the mask, to be renevved annually, perhaps w ithin the context o f the farming com m unity’s seasonal ritual festivals. The pierced arm stumps w hich frequently occur on standing figurines o f the B ird Goddess type could have served for the attachm ent o f w in g plum es; but generally, perforations through the shoulders, arms and hips vvere p robably intended to perm it the figures to be hung up in the home, in shrines or trees, perhaps also to bc used in ritual svvinging. Sw inging is kn ow n from ancient Greece in the festival o f Aiora (Nilsson 19 5 0 : 3 3 1- 3 2 ) . A relevant scene is depieted on an A ttic red-figure skyphos vvhere a satyr wearing a ceremonial head-dress is sw inging a yo u n g girl. A sw inging figurine attached to pillars p ortrayed in clay has been found in H agia Triadha, Crete, n o w in the Heraklion museum. Indced, a num ber o f N eolithic-Chalcolithic figurines are shovvn in a half-seated, half-standing position believed to be conncctcd w ith sw in gin g, in the spring, as a fertility rite (Marinatos 1968: 7-9).

P a r a l l e l s in C r e t e a n d A n c i e n t G r e e c e , a n d TH E TH EATRICAL
EMPHASIS
Masked figures appear on M inoan sculptures, vases, signet rings and seals. A goddess and w orshippers in the ritual dance scene on the ring from Isopata near Knossos, Crete, wear insect masks. The G orgon Medusa head became a terror mask, although the C orfu pedim ent o f about 600 b c proves that Medusa was originally a Great Goddess (Bieber 1939: 35). A satyr-like masked man with padded knickers and fat belly, a w e ll-k n o w n figure from G reek com edy, is encountered on a Late M ycenaean seal from C y p ru s and on the M inoan steatite vase from H agia T riadha (W ebster 19 59 : 10). His costume closely resemblcs that o f the masked and padded figure 2 4 , 2 5 from the Vinča site o f Fafos. A nim al-headed dem ons w a lk in g upright, as depieted on M ycenaean frescoes and gem s (M ylonas 1966: 126), must be humans w earing masks. On a M inoan ring from Phaistos (W ebster 19 59 : 8, fig. 4) a hum an mask is shovvn between tw o goats. Portrayal o f the mask alone vvas as im portant as portrayal o f masked creatures, for it vvas the reccptaclc o f invisible divine forces. O n the m any vases used during the D ionysian festival o f Lenaia a mask 011 a post decorated vvith dresses represented the god him self. T h e priests or priestesses and the vvorshippers o f ancient Greece and Italy vvore m asks; the satyrs and the maenads vvho danced in frenzy at D ionysian festivals, w ere m asked; e vcryo n c vvho danced for the god and m ade m usic vvas masked. Each different m ythical persona vvas represented by a different mask. M asks o f centaurs are knovvn from the sixth ccntury b c (Kenner 19 5 4 : 12). A liturgical use o f masked participants, the thiasotcs or tragoi, led ultim ately to their appearance upon the stage and to the birth o f tragedy. Masked figures survive in Greek com ed y o f the fifth century b c . In their dram a the com ic poets used ehoruses o f animals, birds, fish and insects, and hybrid creatures or sirens (Sifakis 19 6 7; 19 7 1) , vvhich w ere not an invention o f the sixth and fifth centurics b c but trače their origins to the M ycenaean and M inoan era and to O ld Europe. Players danced vvith vvooden masks in h onour o f A rtem is C o ryth alia in Italy, and in the tem ple o f A rtem is O rthia in Sparta w ere found clay masks o f the seventh and early sixth century b c . T h e y vvere m ade in im itation o f vvooden masks used in the perform ances and dances and songs dedicated to Artem is. This an alogy, and the shape and decoration o f Vinča masks, strongly suggest that the mask representations on đay figurines are replicas in m iniaturc o f vvooden masks. Masks and masked figures, life-size or in m iniature, o f Ancient Greece, Minoan Crete and Old Europe, im plv liturgy and drama vvhose emphasis is theatrical. It is quite conceivable that ali three belong to the same tradition. M asked figurines are m im etic repre sentations o f rituals and m ythological scenes.

5 Shrines and the Role of Figurines
The abundance o f clay statuettes portraying costumed, masked wom en and men im plies that the O ld European peoples re-enacted rituals, but it is necessary to look elsevvhere in the archaeological record fo r the cerem onial accoutrem ents o f the cult, in order to reconstruct its practice m ore precisely.
C la y m o d els o f sh rin es
The miniature clay house-models produced throughout the N eoli thic-Chalcolithic period are particularly imp'ortant, presenting details o f arehiteeture, decoration and furnishing that are othervvise unavailable to the prehistoric archaeologist. Som e o f these models, diseovered under the corners o f excavated house-floors or b y the centra! post supporting the roof, must have been used in a sacrificial cerem ony to celebrate the ereeđon o fth e strueture. Several exam ples were diseovered in such a context at the Starčevo settlem ent o f R o szk e-L u d var near Szeged in H un gary (T ro g m a y er 1966) and at Branč, a L en gyel site in Slovakia (Vladar 1969: 506). A d ivin ity vvas modelled in re lie f on the gable. In the N eolithic m ound o f Porodili near Bitola in Southern Yugoslavia several house-models o fa uniquc typc vvere excavated: each has a cylindrical ‘ch im n ey’ upon vvhich are m odelled the masked features o fa beaked and large-eyed goddess vvith a necklaceencircling her neck and spreading o ver the roof. T h e m odels have elaborate doors, either o f an invertcd T shape or vvith angular cut-outs, and probably represent temples dedicated to a particular goddess. A house-model vvith a b ird ’s head and incised plum age found at the Early V inča site o f Turda? in T ransylvania, must sign ify the same concept. T h e m odel o f a sanctuary from Vadastra in vvestern R o m a nia has divine proteetors in the form s o f a rani and a buli. T h e tvvo temples have pitehed roofs and štand upon a high podium decorated vvith a spiral and lattice pattern.

A m o d e l d iseovered in 1966 on a r iv e r -is la n d settlem ent o f the G um elni(a c u lt u r e , at Cascioarele in S o u th e rn R o m a n ia , has caused the interpretative confines o f the prehistorian’s understanding o f N eolithic-C halcolithic struetures an d cult practices to be readjusted (Hortensia Dum itrcscu 1968). The red-baked, polished clay model vvas found ly in g close to a large house (10 X 7 m.) divided by partition w alls into tw o corridors. T he w o od cn construction o f the house was not preserved; but traces o f its peculiar strueture, the presence o f a sacrificial place w ith a ‘b e n c h ’ (altar) tw o metres aw ay, and num erous cult vases o f unusual shape, including askoi, suggest that it was a sanctuary. It is im possible to say, h o w e vcr, w hether or not the m odel had b e e n vvithin, or should be associated w ith, the house strueture near vvhich it was found. T h e m odel is 24.2 cm . high and 5 1 cm . lo n g at the base. It consists o f a large s u b s tr u c tu r e , like the stereobate o f a classical Greek temple, which supports four individual temples, each o f vvhich has a w ide-arched portal and is crovvned vvith horns on the gable and above the four corners. The entrance to each tem ple has a narrovv border in relief, suggcsting a d oor-fram e, from vvhich tw o ribs project obliquely upvvards bctvveen the lintel and the roof, perhaps indicating the vvooden supports o f an arcade leading to the tem ple. T h ere is no further arehiteetural detail vvithin the temples. T h e front surfacc o f th e substructure is decorated w ith irregular horizontal incised lines and ten round holes. T h e m odel tem ples presum ably illustrate real struetures at least three metres in h eigh t; add to that a substructure corresponding to that o f the m odel, and vve have a tem ple com p lex ten or m ore metres high. T h e hori zontal lines m ight depict fligh ts o f stairs or a terrace-like strueture, but the presence o f holes, vvhich should represent entrances, remains inexplicable. M rs D um itrescu interprets the incised lines as an indication o f vvood construction, in vvhich casc the holes could represent entrances into the podium , vvhere staircases vvould lead up to the level o f t h e tem ples. In addition, there vvas p robably a stairw a y access on the outside o f the podium , and on top there must have been a terrace to accom m odate a vvorshipping congregation. Tem ples supportcd on terraced substructures are knovvn from Sum erian arehiteeture at the end o f the fourth m illcnnium B C . As the closest parallel to the Cascioarele m odel M rs D um itrescu cites the tem ple from Susa, depieted in a stylized en gravin g on a cylinder seal o f the proto-urban period, c. 3300 b c . It has a large substructure vvith entrances and apertures. O n top there is a rectangular tem ple vvhich has tvvo gates and is decorated vvith three bull-horns on each side (H. D um itrescu 19 6 8 : Fig. 7). R ad io carb o n tests gave the dates 3668 x 120 and 35 35 J~ 12 0 b c ; calibratcd, they take us back to the second h a lf o f the fifth m illennium ne.

The m odel from Cascioarele is not unique. W ithin the area o f distribution ofthe East Balkan civilization many fragm ents ofsim ilar models, usually smaller, have been knovvn for a long time. A ‘tvvostorey house’ diseovered in the site o f R u se , on the lovver D anube in B u lgaria, possesses arehiteetural similarities to the Cascioarele model (G eo rgiev-A n gelo v, Ruse: 58, Fig. 20). Th e surface o f the loWer part is incised vvith ro u gh ly parallel lines and pierced b y round apertures; vvhile the second storey, the main temple, has a strueture 0f vertical posts and horizontal beams. This m odel vvas fragm en tary, particularly its upper part, and the reconstruction m ay not be entirely correct. Struetures vvith vvide-arched portals standing on ' terraced stereobates are depieted by other clay m odels excavated from the same settlem ent o f R u se during 1948-49 (id.: Fig. 90) and from Izvoarele in R o m a n ia . T h e detail on these m odels suggests that the tem ple’s foundation need not in variably have been o f vvood, but might consist o f steeply terraced earth. A quadrangular clay model o f a tem ple vvith vvide-arched portals on ali four sides vvas recently diseovered in a Late N eolithic context in the site o f K ran n on -D u rak i in Thessaly (M ichaud 1970). Arehiteetural remains encountered during excavations at V arvarovka, a Cucuteni-Tripolye settlement near Kishenev, Soviet M oldavia, vvere considered to represent the collapse o f tw o-storey rather than single-storey struetures. A clay model o f a tw o-storey sanctuary, the second floor com prising the tem ple, vvas diseovered in 1969 near K ie v in the R o s river valley. (The m odel is housed in the A rchaeological Institute o f the A cadem y o f Sciences in K iev.) There are entrances on both floors, and in front o f the large portal or gate o f the m ain tem ple is a platform adorned vvith bulls’ horns. Vertical vvall-posts are indicated in re lie f and the arehed r o o f is supported by horizontal beams. M iniature clay m odels o f shrines from the B u g V alley in the vvestern U krain e h ave been knovvn since the beginning o f the tvventieth century. T h e m odel from Popudnia, a Late C ucuteni (in Russian ‘T rip o ly e C ’) settlement north o f U m an , vvas diseovered by H im ner in 19 12 (H im ner 1933). It is usually interpreted as a building resting on piles because the m odel stands on cylindrical clay legs. B y analogy vvith other m odels o f shrines, som e o f vvhich are illustrated in this volum e, it m ay be assumed that the presence o f these supports is mcant to stress the im portance o f the sanctuary’s elevation above the ground. Hundreds o f Cucuteni houses have since been excavated, none o f vvhich vvas built on piles. T h e Popudnia model consists o f the main room and a vestibuleorenđosed platform . Betvveen them there is a rectangular entrance vvith a threshold. O n the right side stands a large rectangular oven, raised on a platform , and benehes. O n the bench to the right o f the oven, a fem ale figurine

M any other models o f Cucuteni shrincs from V ladim i rovka and Shuvkovka are roofless (Passck 1949: 100, 125). The m odel found in the classical Cucuteni site o f V lad im iro vk a has cxterio r and interior vvalls. T h e floor o f the main hali and o f the vestibule is painted in red, vvliite and dark brovvn concentric circles and sem icirclcs, and there are zigzag bands around the entrance, the round vvindovv and along the top o f the vvalls.

One o f the m ost excitin g discoveries in R o m an ia vvas the tem ple unearthed in the village o f Cascioarele in a layer im m ediately below the Gumelni^a stratum in vvhich the large clay m odel o f the edifice was found. T h e carbonized w o o d revealed radiocarbon dates in the region o f 4000 b c (Berlin Lab. dates: 5980 ± 100 B P , 5860 ± 100 BP and 5570 ± 100 B P). Calibrated, they equate vvith the early part o f the fifth m illennium b c . Vases found standing on the hardened clay floor are o f late Boian style o f the East Balkan civilization. The sanctuary is rectangular in plan, 16 X 10 m ., divided into two rooms b y a ro w o f six posts. O nly one room has a painted 24 interior, its vvalls being cream on a red background, in the fo rm o f curvilinear and angular designs o f thin ribbons and larger bands. A terracotta m edallion, nearly circular in shape, decorates the vvestern wall. It is painted vvith a band o f red spirals bordered vvith a thin line o f cream paint on a brovvnish-green background. T w o pillars vvere found in this room . T h e larger one is about 2 m. high. It has a hollovv interior and vvas p rob ab ly m odelled around a tree trunk vvhich vvas then rem oved after the clay hardened, because no traces o f vvood remain. T h e pillar, like the vvalls, vvas painted three times and each set o f the painted geom etric designs is different. T h e pillar vvas 31 encircled b y posts, but does not seem to have had any arehiteetural 40

Sixteen fem ale figurines w ere found at its Southern side, ali seated on h om -backed stools. In the corner, behind the altar, vvas a clay throne or chair. Its seat, one metre w id e, vvas o rigin ally covered vvith split planks. The total num ber o f the figurines found in this sanctuary was th irty-tw o . A li o f them are schernatically rendered vvith fat thighs and a snake-shaped head. A few vvere perforated through the shoulders, but have no arms except one w ho holds a baby snake or phallus (Fig. 26, bottom ro w , centre). The association o f quern and grindstones vvith figurines portrayed in a seated position suggests m agical grinding o f grain and then perhaps baking o f sacred bread. There vvas an overseer in control o f the proceedings, p robably a priestess or priest, seated on the full-size chair near the altar. In the Classical Cucuteni settlem ent o f K olom ijshchina 1 in the middle D nieper region a raised red-painted altar, 70 cm. in diam eter, was diseovered in the centre o f one o f the houses (N o . 6), near the

funetion. N earb y, a skeleton o f an adult in a crouched position vvas diseovered. A nother, thinner pillar (only 10 cm . in diameter), but o f the same height and also hollovv inside, vvas found close to the interior vvall. It is painted vvith cream ribbons, 8 - 1 2 m m . vvide, on a reddish-brovvn background. N ex t to it vvas a terracotta beneh, c. 40 cm. high and painted vvith curvilinear ribbons of cream paint. M an y fragm ents o f large pitlioi decoratcd vvith excised m otifs, and vases, painted 111 vvhite on a lustrous brovvn b ackgroun d, vvere found above the floor (V. D um itrescu 1970). In the C ucuteni (T ripolye) civilization, rcm ains o f a tem ple vvere found in the site o f Sabatinovka II in the valley o ft h e Southern Bug (M akarevich 1 9 6 0 M ovsha 19 7 1). It dates from the Proto-Cu'cuteni period (‘ Early T rip o ly e ’ 111 Russian term in o logy). T h e rectangular building occupied about 70 sq. m. A narrovv entrance vvas located on the long side. T h e entrance area vvas paved vvith flat stones and the rest o f the floor vvas plastered vvith clay. A bone figurine vvas found at the entrance. Each part o f the building served a different cult purpose. A bo ut halfvvav in, tovvards the right, there was a large oven, at the base o f vvhich a fem ale figurine vvas found. B eyo n d and to the right o f the oven vvas a group o f vessels, ineluding a dish filled vvith burnt bones o f a buli and a channel-dccorated pot vvith a small cup inside; to the left o f these stood a brazier (an incense burner?), a group o f five saddle querns and a rovv o f five terracotta figurines.

Human sacrifice accompanied by animal sacrifice and offerings of other objeets vvas p erform ed in open-air sanctuaries. In a Late C u cu teni site at T svik lo v tsi, Podolia in the vvestern U kraine, the cremated bones o f a youth aged about tw en ty w ere found, together vvith those o f a buli, m arten and sheep near an offering pit vvhich contained eighteen vessels, grindstones, vvhorls, net sinkers, and an antler pick. A b o v e another pit filled vvith charcoal and ashes stood a rectangular altar. T h ere vvas one m ore pit plastered vvith clay, in vvhich, together vvith layers o f ash, stood a large storage ja r vvith remains o f vvheat grains. A t the base o f the pit, a stone polisher, an aw l, and fragments o f dishes and cups v/ere diseovered. T his sacrificial area vvas adjacent to the excavated village (M oshva 1 971). Sacrificial pits filled vvith anim al bones or skulls, charcoal, ashes and pots have also been found vvithin the settlement area. In the Len gycl settlement o f B ranč near N itra in Slovakia, dcep conical pits vvith vvalls and bottom s lined vvith clay vvere locatcd at one end o f large, tvvo-room houses. In one pit, nearly 2 m. deep, there vvas a bu ll’s skull vvith horns. M any layers are to be seeri in the sacrificial pits: offerings vvere solidly covered vvith clay and then vvith loess. T h e sterile layers in betvveen the remains o f sacrifices perhaps signify annual intervals (Vladar 1969: 507). W orship vvith offerings or m ysteries took place in natural caves as ritual pottery and graffiti testify.

’^ jja lo g o u s shrine equipm ent and votive offerings cover a vvide period from Chalcolithic or even Neolithic O ld Europe to Classical Greece. I shall m ention here a fevv closely related exam ples. The Late M in oan I shrine o f the provincial tovvn o f G ournia in eastern C rete is situated at som e distance from the palače on the suinrnit o f the tovvn hill and had a road leading to it. T h e shrine vvas 5niall, o n ly 4 X 3 m ., vvith rudely constructed vvalls. A raised dais ran along the Southern vvall to the right o f the entrance. In the centre stood a lo w plastered earthen table vvith three legs, and around it three curious tube-shaped vessels and part o f a fourth. T h e y have a vertical ro w o f three or four snake-like loops on either side, a big ger handle on the back, and above this a pair o f horns o f consecration; one o f these vessels is entvvined b y tw o snakes. T h e other objeets inciude a bell-shaped fem ale idol vvith raised hands and a snake around the body, tvvo heads o f other Snake Goddesses, three arms, hands and bases o f other figurines, tvvo snake heads, fou r small birds, and a fragm ent o f a clay pithos (N ilsson 19 5 0 : 80-82). C le a rly the Snake Goddess vvas invoked and vvorshipped in this small shrine. Its equipment has m uch in com m on vvith the snake-decorated vases and Snake Goddess figurines o f O ld Europe. The snake cult is evident also in the palače at Knossos. A t the entrance to a little room in a private house in the southvvestern part o f the palače dating from the Late M inoan I and II period stood a large jar. It contained a num ber o f clay vessels, including tubular ones o f terracotta provided vvith tw o pairs o f cups, a terracotta štand, the upper part o f vvhich is divided into four com partm ents, tvvo small jugs and vessels o f unusual form over vvhich snakes are coiled. The last-named are perforated like strainers and probably served for invoking rain b y allovving vvater to run through the holes. In ali areas o f C h alcolithic O ld Europe vessels vvith perforations frequently occur; gen erally they are made o fa thick clay vvith rough and uneven holes. Som e are zoom orphic or ornithom orph ic and others have perforations in the snake coils. A t M ycen ae recent excavations revealcd a little room filled vvith terracotta sculptures o f vvhich nineteen vvere human idols o f both sexes up to 50-60 cm . high, and seventeen vvere coiled snakes (T aylo u r 1970: 274).

had a ccntral socket w hich was m eant to receive the shaft o f the d oub lc-axc. O n either side o f the horns stood terracotta figurines com prising three bell-shaped idols, and tw o v o ta ry figures, one male and one female. T h e female figurine probably portrays the main goddess o fth e shrine (N ilsson 19 50 : 80). T he doub le-axe m ost likely represents the epiphany o f the G reat Goddess since she assumed the shape o f a buttorfly rising from the horns o f a buli (sce ehapter 8). O b v io u slv the G reat Goddess w as \vorshipped in this little shrine. T h e tw o-pillared sanctuary o f Cascioarele has m an y parallels in C retan towns and palaces as w ell as in M ycenaean Greece. A pillar or tw o in a shrine vvas the m ost frequent attribute o f a M inoan sanctuary. At Koum asa, for instance, the sanctuary was composed o f several room s, one o f which had a w ooden colum n in the m iddle; a cylindrical idol and a table for offerings stood iu.situ (A rch. Anzeiger 1 9 0 7 : 1 0 8 ; Nilsson 1 9 5 0 : 10 2). Pillar room s are know n from virtually ali C retan palaces. A t Knossos they are present in ali phases o f the site. T h e oldest pillar room was found in the building w hich belongs to the initial stage o f M iddle M inoan I. In it tw o rectangular pillars w ere found, each about tvvo metres high, and carvcd from a single slab o f limestone. N ear the Southern wall opposite the space between the tw o pillars was a circular pit. I11 the hillside west o f the palače at Knossos is situated the ‘ little palače’, the foundation o f w hich belongs to the beginning o f Late M inoan. It has three pillar room s. The vvestern room has tw o pillars, one o f vvhich is com plctely preserved and consists o f a base and tvvo gypsum blocks. Bctvvcen the pillars a shallovv stone vat vvith a smaller sunken square in the m iddle had been let into the ground. At the ‘ royal villa ’ o f Knossos. in a building o f Late M inoan II date, north o f the main room there is a pillar room , 4 .15 • 4 ni., paved vvith gyp su m slabs. I11 the centre stands a pillar com posed o f tvvo gvpsum blocks. A sunken channel form s a rcc
tangle around the central pillar, about m id w ay betvveen it and the vvalls. T h e house near the southeastern angle o f the palače at Knossos contains a m ost interesting pillar room from M id d le M inoan III. In the m iddle o f the rectangular room stands a pillar, consisting o f six blocks vvith a doub le-axe engraved on one o f the upper blocks. A truncated pyram idal gyp sum block vvas found close to the foo t o fth e pillar vvhich p rob ab ly served as the base fo r a double axe. F ro m this side o f the pillar to the vvall runs a foundation vvith m an y flat stone bases vvhich m ay have served as stands fo r vessels. O n the other side o f this vvall an iv o ry knot vvas found, and in the an te-roo m stood a six-legged o fferin g table (Evans, Palače o f M inos, I, I46ff., 4 4 1 ; II, 396, 407, 5 1 5 ; N ilsson 19 5 0 : 237-40). Pillar room s vvere revealed in the palaces at Phaistos, H agia Triadha, M allia and Z a k ro . In the palače at H agia T riadh a a square pillar stood in the m iddle o f a rectangular room . A quadrangular channel surrounded the pillar as in the ‘royal v illa ’ at Knossos. In the peighbouring ro om m an y v o tive figures vvere found. T o the northvv^st o f the palače tvvo pillars stood in one o f the room s used for burials in the Late M in o an III period. An ou tdoor C retan pillar shrine is reported from P h ylako p i on the island o f M elos, a M iddle M inoan III tovvn. (N ilsson 19 50 : 241, 242.) O n the m ainland, an interesting pillar ro om čam e to light at Asine, in a room com plex knovvn as the ‘ M ycenaean palače’ . Standing in the centre o f a fairly large room , 7 X 5 m ., tvvo colum n bases vvere found. In one corner there vvas a bench or ledge m ade o f undressed stone slabs. O n this ledge a quantity o f m ale and fem ale figurines, vessels and a stone axc oncc stood, some o f vvhich had fallen to the floor, (Persson and Frodin, A sin e : 298, 30 8 ; N ilsson 1950: 1 1 1 , 112). The vvorship ofstalagm ites in caves from the N eo lith ic period to M inoan C rete and A ncient Greece vvas ve ry likely related to that o f pillars. In G rotta Scaloria, in the G argano Peninsula o f Southern Italy, a beautiful painted pot dating from about 6000 b c vvas standing by a stalagmite (Archaeological M useum o f Foggia). A cave east o f Heraklion dedicated to Eileithyia, goddess o f childbirth, contained a stalagmite and a relatively smaller one next to it. In m an y other caves on C rete, at Psychro, Kam ares, A rk alo k h o ri and elsevvhere, the artifacts and sym bols attest the vvorship o f the G reat Goddess (Alexiou 1969: 79). From the large n u m b e ro f pillar shrines, the engravings o f doubleaxes on lim estone pillars in M inoan palaces, and the presence o f stepped or conical supports vvith holes for inserting the shaft o f a double-axe, an em blem o f the Great Goddess, it is apparent that the pillar cult vvas associatcd vvith the vvorship o f this d ivin ity. Pictorial representations on ■M inoan-M yccnacan gold rings, in which a trec grovvs out o f the shrine enclosing a pillar, indicate that

pillar and plant are sym b olically interrelated, both sym bolizing the p o w e r o f life or the povver o f the goddess. This sym b olic notion is strengthened by other representations on M inoan-M ycenaean gold rings in w hich the colum n is flanked by m ale anim als, usually lions or griffms (replacing the dogs that flank the tree in Chalcolithic O ld Europe). T h e same anim als flank the goddess in her epiphany as a butterfly, i.e., a w o m an vvith a head o f a butterfly associated w ith bull’s horns and a double-axe sym bol. A pillar shrine portraying a sim ilar grou p o f sym bols can be recognized in a fresco in the palače at K nossos; here the raised central colum n is fitted into a Socket o f bu ll’s horns, belo w w hich is the ideogram o f the G reat G oddess: the ‘split e g g ’, tw o sem icircular rosettes d ivided in the m iddle (A lexiou 1969: 82, Fig. 30). O ther colum ns o f the same fresco also had bullhorn sockets. T he M inoan and O ld European pillar was not an axis o f the ’universe, not the axis mundi o f the A ltaic and northern E u ro pean cosm ologies, but an incarnation o f the G reat Goddess in her aspect as the source o f life-po w er. M ost students o f M inoan cuiture are bevvildered by the abundance o f cult practices. Shrines o f one kind or another are so num erous that there is reason to believe that not on ly every palače but every private house vvas put to som e such tise. Characteristic o f these dom estic cults are the horns o f consecration and the tables for offerings vvhich occur almost everyvvhere (Nilsson 1950: 110 ). T o ju d g e b y the frequency o f shrines, horns o f consecration and the sym b ol o f the double-axe, the vvhole palače o f Knossos must have resembled a sanctuary. W herever you turn, pillars and symbols rem ind one o f the presence o f the Great Goddess or the Snake G od dess. T his situation is related to that found in N eolithic and C h alco lithic E u ro p e : in houses there vvere sacred corners vvith ovens, altars (benches) and offering places, and there vvere separate shrines dedicatcd to certain goddesses.

T h e y seem to have been m anufactured in conjunction vvith figurines, to provide dom estic com forts for divinities. In j j exceptional circumstances the remains o f full-sized furniture have been diseovered. In the Petre$ti settlement o f Pianul de Jo s at Hunedoara, a fire, vvhich possibly occurred vvithin a strueture housing a shrine, preserved parts o f a roughly triangular table vvhich vvas plastered vvith clay and displayed a decoratcd pancl in relief. 14 Careful excavation shovved that richly decorated pedestalled vases, dishes, a ja r and several lids must have been standing on this table and a large storage ja r under it, before the fire broke out. A t M ed vednjak, a Vinča settlement in central Y u go slavia, in a rectangular shrine 5 m. long, tvvo large groups o f ritual vases vvere uncovered next to the burnt remains o f a vvooden strueture, probably an altar table (1970 excavation by R .

T o w ard s the m iddle o f the room , near the oven, lay a heap o f 150 clay balls with a bull-legged vessel and a pot on top; another pot, full o f grain, stood close by. A particular type o f vessel seems to have been used in sacrificial cerem onies. It consists o f a shallovv b o w l sunk into a flat slab which m ay be triangular, standing on three legs, or rectangular and fourlegged. Such vessels are decorated by incision, encrustation and painting; they sometimes have animal-head protomes projecting fro m the corners and legs, and m ay take a hum an shape. Som e o f the m ost im pressive are supported by m assive bull-legs or rest on stand ing or crouching animals. The buli or deer models from the East 2 4 0 -24 2; 170 Balkan civilization are outstanding illustrations o f this type o f vessel. Libation vases m ake up another series o f cult vessels; these m ay be jug-shaped, spouted, zoomorphic, bird-shaped or anthropom orphic, and are o f fine fabric. T h e y are variously ornam ented, according to local styles, being either incised or decorated with red, graphite, or polychrom e painting in com plex curvilinear and m eandroid designs. C la y ladles, exquisitely shaped and decorated, occur in great num bers in ali parts o f O ld Europe. Those found at the Classical Cucuteni sites are beautifully painted. In the East Balkans som e have anthropo m orphic handles portraying masked faces. The abundant production o f small zoom orphic containers or lamps with projecting animal heads usually o f rams, snakes or bulls and vvith various engraved ideogram s suggests that they served as v o tive offerings to particular deities, ju st as sim ilar objeets vvere sacrificed during the M inoan and H elladic B ron ze A g e and in the later Eleusinian M ysteries. Literary records mention incense burners and oil lamps am ong the objeets sacrificed to D em eter o f Despoina in Lykosu ra (Nilsson 19 57). T rad itio n ally, incense burners and lamps vvere used as far back as pottery in E u ro pe: on close observation the painted N eolithic ring-based and footed vessels exhibit loss o f slip on the interior surfaces ow in g to some unusual use to vvhich these vessels vvere put, possibly burning (cf. study o f ceram ic tech n ology o f Anza pottery o f c. 6000 b c b y Elizabcth Gardner). In C ucuteni and East Balkan ceram ic art sophisticated anthropo m orphic vase supports are found. T h cy take the form o f either a single hum an figure (headless, or clse vvith one o r tvvo faces) or a group o f interconnected bowed figures. The human body, particularly the shoulders and arm s, provided an appropriate sculptural m o tif for m onum ental stand-supports modelled by Cucutcni artists. A notable ex:amplc from Frumu$ica ineorporates five vvell-proportioned human figures standing erect on a single base, the upper part o f their bodies connectcd by their em bracing arms. The raising o f a
vessel is a com m on practice in ritual celebrations, usually associated vvith fertility m agic and pleas for future prosperity. T h e Bulgarians have retained a N evv Y e a r ’s custom in vvhich the three eldest w o m en o f the fam ily thrice raise the trough containing the sacred Nevv Y ear’s bread-dough (R y bakov 1965). There are statuettes portraying vvomen seated on a stool and holding conical containers for vvater. A rem arkably w ell-preserved exam ple from B o rd još in the lovver Tisza valley shows a naked vvoman sitting stiffly, both hands firm ly holding a dish on her lap. Another exam ple, a seated figure holding a bow l and a dish w ith a ladle, comes from a Cucuteni site at N ezv isk o in the vvestern U k rain e (R y b a k o v 19 6 5: Fig. 3). T h e E arly V inča settlement o f Fafos yieldeđ a sculpture o f a seated, masked vvoman perform ing a m agical rite o v er the vessel vvhich she is holding. A v e ry distinctive sculpture o f a male figure vvas diseovered during the excavation o f the Tisza settlement at Szegvar in southeastern H u n gary. H e vvears a flat mask and in his right hand holds a sickle extending o ver his shoulder. O n both arms brac^lets are indicated in relief, five on the right and one on the left. A broad, decorated belt is incised round the vvaist o fh is stout body. T his figure has attracted much attention, and recently Kalicz (1970) term ed the period o f the Tisza culture ‘L ’e'poque du Dieu a la faucille’ , the epoch ofth e Sickle God, a dominant male deity. M akkay (1964) considers this figure an ancestor o f the G reek god Kronos. His dignified posture, and his mask, sickle and festive attire, proelaim his im portant status; his authoritative possession o f the sickle im plies that he, as central figure o f the cult, is presiding over its rites. In ancient G reek festivals devoted to A rtem is and D em eter the sickle vvas still displayed, symbolizing victory (Nilsson 1957). A curved stick o f copper or gold knovvn from the third m illennium in the N ear East and the Caucasus vvas an insignia o f povver, a sym bolic value inherited from an early agricultural era, vvhen the sickle vvas regarded as a sacred cult instrument. T h ere is archaeological evidence o f com posite sickles, flint blades set in vvood or bone, and o f their utilization for reaping from earliest N eo lith ic tim e s.T h a t they vvere used as cult or orna menta! objeets in ritual festivities is revealed b y sickle im itations vvhich vvere produced in copper in east central Europe about 5000 b c . T h e Szegvžr figure vvould seem to be e x em p lify in g the novel and valuable produets o f a copper technology still in its infancy. Bracelets m ade o f round copper vvire are knovvn from both the Tisza and Vinča cultural com plexes, and an enorm ous copper sickle, 54 cm. long, has been diseovered in H u n gary at Zaerszentm ihaly. The sickle vvas an isolated find but its shape is v e ry m uch the same as that belonging to the statuette, suggesting that thcy are contem poraneous. T he S ze g v ar male sculpture is unique, the other Tisza figurines being female.

The above exam ples are but rem inders o f the use o f musical instruments in cult cerem onies as in M inoan C rete and in the C yclad es (Zervos, C rete: 39 1, 445, 704). A priestess holding a triton shell is depieted on a M inoan seal from the Idaean C a v e standing at an altar topped vvith the horns o f consecration vvith the tree o flife representing the goddess’ epiphany in the m iddle.

V O T IV E OFFERINGS: INSCRIBED FIGURINES, VESSELS, SPINDLF.-W HORLS

M an had to persuade the divinity he vvorshipped to be propitious to him. H oards o f votive figurines, miniature vessels and other objeets are constantly being recovered in N eolithic, Chalcolithic, M inoan, M ycenaean and Greek caves and sanctuaries, as vvell as those o f O ld Europe. T h e m aker’s name, the name o f the goddess, or a sort o f contract or prom ise, vvas sometimes inscribed on a figurine, plaque, spindle-vvhorl or miniature vessel. A pproxim ately one out o f every hundred figurines vvas incised vvith the signs o f the Lincar O ld European script (not religious symbols and not ideograms). Since other objeets, such as spindle-vvhorls, m iniature vessels, plaques and dishes or bovvls, vvere sim ilarly inscribed, they too must have been votive offerings. V ariou s signs are found 011 the front, back and sides o f O ld European figurines. Minoan figurines vvere sinnlarly inscribed, and an idol from the M iddle M inoan palače o f Tylissos bearing Linear A signs is reproduced herc for com parison. Som e characters o f the script, notably a triangular sign in conjunction vvith vertical lin.es, are repeated quite often 011 figurines and other objeets. O n the Vinča figurine herc illustratcd, other signs - a meander and chevrons - are also en graved ; these are not script signs, but ideogram s o fth e Snake and B ird Goddess, as w c shall sec from the discussion in the ehapters that follovv.

In G reek times their association vvith the cult o f A rtem is is evident and the notion o f ‘spinning the thread o f life’ is very lik ely to have originated when spinning vvas still in its infancy and was regarded as im bued vvith a m agic povver. Inscribed m iniature vessels are abund an t; in the Vinča m ound no less than 368 vvere found and m an y bore inscriptions o f various kinds. Such vessels bear the same type o f linear sign as do the spindle-vvhorls and figurines. T h e y are not decorative m otifs and not sym bols. The miniature vessels, usually very small and cru d elv m ade, vvere m eant to im itate large vases and vvere dedicated as gifts to goddcsses. O n the rims and vvalls o f larger bovvls and dishes inscriptions also occur. T h e y cannot bc interpreted as p ottcr’s marks, since. they are not single geom etric signs, but a

O n the inner surface there are four ro w s d ivided b y horizontal lines, and on the outside is a schematized anthropom orphic figure, around vvhich the fam iliar script signs are grouped. A nalogous grouping o f signs is knovvn on an object from an Early Vinča site o f Sukoro at Szekesfehervar in vvestern H ungary. O n a round plaque f r o m K aran o vo V I in central B u lgaria, signs consisting ofstraigh t lines were incised betvveen the cross arm s o f the quartered disc (V . I. Georgiev, 1969). Although script signs on figurines, spindle-vvhorls and miniature vessels vvere knovvn and collected from the beginning o f the tvventieth century (Schm idt 19 0 3; Vasić 19 10 , 1936; R oska 19 41), discussions concerning the possible existence o f a N eolithic-Chalcolithic script only began after the three Tartaria plaques or pendants had been diseovered in the Mure§ rive r valley o f vvestern R o m an ia and vvere published by Vlassa in 1963. These plaques, o f vvhich tvvo are perforated, vvere found in association vvith seorehed human bones, tw enty-six schem atic E arly Vinča clay figurines, tvvo alabaster figurines, a clay ‘anehor’ (possibly a fragm ent o f a figurine or horns o f consecration vvith a figure in the m iddle), and a Spondylus-shell bracelet in an ash-filled, sacrificial pit located in the lovvest layer o f the site. The pit vvas covered by tvvo occupation horizons: im m ed iately above vvas a lcvel o f the Petre?ti group and above this vvas a Cojofeni habitation level o f the fourth m illcnnium b c . B y analogy vvith calibrated radiocarbon dates fo r Early Vinča layers at other sites, the d a te 'o f the lovvest occupation level cannot be later than the early fifth m illennium . The Tartaria inscribed objeets are genuine Vinča artifacts, produced tvvo thousand years earlier than the development o f Sumerian civilization and about three thousand years before the appearance o f M inoan Palače culture. One o f the Tartaria tablets shovvs the outlincs o f tvvo animals and a tree. O ne o f the animals in this sy m bolic scene is clearly a goat. T h e association o f goat and tree suggcsts that the Tartaria ritual burial may have been perform ed as part o f the rite o f annual dcath and resurrection. I11 M inoan C rete and in the N ear East, the goat vvas prominent as a sacrificial victim in the festival and the tree sym bolized a nevv life. T h is also im plies the fact that O ld European vvriting vvas associatcd vvith religious funetions. Inscribcd vo tive objeets clcarlv prove the existence o f O ld European Linear signs and, in general, the very early incidence o f vvriting. From the available m atcrial at the present tim e it is seen that the bcginnings lic in the period o f transition from the N eolithic to Chalcolithic (Late S ta rč c v o -E a rly Vinča in central Balkans), c. 5500-5000 b c :.

H A striking developm ent in art at the inception o f the agricultural era vvas its persistent representation o f a num ber o f conventionalized I graphic designs sym bolizing abstract ideas. These ideogram s, recurring on figurines, stamp seals, dishes, cult vessels, and as part o f pictorial decoration o f vases and house vvalls, vvere used for thcuisands ofyears throughout Old European civilization, and help to expand our understanding o f its cosm ogo n y and co sm o lo gy, and o f the funetions o f the deities it sustained. The sym bols fali into tvvo basic categories: those related to vvater or rain, the snake and the bird ; and those associated vvith the m oon, the vegetal life-cycle, the rotation o f seasons, the birth and grovvth essential to the perpetuation o f life. The first category consists o f symbols vvith sim ple parallel lines, V ’s, zigzags, chevrons and meanders, and spirals. T h e second group ineludes the cross, the encircled cross and m ore com plex derivations o f this basic m o tif vvhich sym b olically connects the four corners o f the vvorld, the crescent, horn, Caterpillar, egg and fish.

The cross, vvith its arms direeted to the four corners o ft h e eosm os, is a universa] sym bol created or adopted by farm ing com m unitics in the N eolithic and extending into present day folk art.

Its purpose is to prom ote and assure the contm uance o f the cosm ic cycle, to help the vvorld through ali phases o f the m oon and the ehanging seasons. Graphite-painted East Balkan dishes have cross and cosm ic snake designs vvhich recurrently present identical com positions o f ‘ the universc’ . The hooks or branehing lines attached to the four arm s o f the cross reinforce its d ynam icexp ression.

The cross and its various derivative sym bols are frequently Jičountered in the incised or painted ceram ic decorations o f each *f§)lithic and C h alcolithic grou p . T h eir consistent appearance on $ishes, bow ls, vases, stamp seals and the crow ns o f figurines strongly ||g ests that they are ideogram s necessary to prom ote the recurrent irthand grow th o f plant, animal, and human life. T hey are symbols ilt h e continuum o f life w hich had to be ensured. Painted or engraved ! h the bases or insides o f dishes they must have served as go od -lu ck sjm bols as they still do in the European peasant culture. Life is 'resent on ly w here there is no stagnation and the regularity o f nature not obstructed b y the forces o f death. In E gyp tian hieroglyphics the cross stands for life or liv in g and form s part o f such w ords as fp!health’ and ‘happiness’ . A related concept could have dom inated Slh e minds o f early European farmers. A smooth transition from one ||)hase to another spelled happiness. The fourfold compositions, K | ir c h e t y p a l o f perpetual renewal or wholeness and the m oon in the Ms' symbolism o f O ld Europe, are associated vvith the Great Goddess o f Life and Death, and the Goddess o f V egetation, m oon goddesses Par excellence.

T h e y do not depict the end result o f s m rwholeness but rather the continuous strivin g tovvards it, the active a p .p ro c e s s o f creation. A painting on a C ucuteni dish from Valea f* Lupului shovvs stylized horns o f four bulls, each quartered by crossed om lines, with a crescent o r a Caterpillar in each section, a sym bol related S ' to the idea o f periodic regeneration. There is a m orphological relationship betvveen the buli, on.account o f its fast-grow in g horns, and the w a x in g aspect o f the m oon, vvhich is further evidence o f the bull’s sym b olic funetion as invigorator. T h e w orship o f the m oon and horns is the w o r s h ip o f the C re a tiv e and fecund p o v v e rs o f nature. In W estern Asia o f the fourth to second m illennia, the cross was usually associated vvith the lunar crescent and was an alternative symbol o f the m oon (Briffault 1 9 6 3 : 3 4 3 , Figs. 8 - 1 2 ) . Painted on a Classical Cucuteni vase from Tru$e§ti are quartered d isc designs having a cross inside vvith knobbed extrem ities, p robably sym bolizing four phases o f the m oon, hooked to a horn. A portrayal o f the head o f a buli vvith the lunar disc betvveen its horns occurs in relief on a vase from a Late Cucuteni site o f Podei. T h e disc is quartcred by Crossing lines possibly indicating the four phases o f the m oon. In the low er section o f the vase, the bull’s horns are shovvn upside dovvn, perhaps to sym b olize the dcad buli.

C o n cu rren tly, almost naturalistic m odels o f snakes were produced b y ali the cultural groups o f O ld Europe in bone, w o o d or clay. A coiled pottery snake, decorated vvith incised zigzag and punctate designs, vvas found at the E arly Vinča settlement o f Predio nica. T h e entire inner surface o f a ritual dish vvith holes fro m K u ko va M og ila in B ulgaria is covered b y a snake coil. T he zigzaggin g outer coil contrasts witf\th,e inner spiral and suggests the radiating sun. A form idable horned snake m odelled in re lie f vvinds around a N eo li thic pot from the site' o f S u vo d o l-D ib el in Pelagonia. Snakes, their bodies m arked by dots or com b-like stamps, h ave been found in cised on a n u m b e ro f vases from the Vinča m ound. T he V inča settle ment o f Potporanj at V ršac yieldcd curling snakes carved out o f bone, vvith triangular heads and cye-holes. Snake ornam entation dominates the ceramics o f the N eo lith ic Linear P ottery culture in central Europe and that o f the B iik k group in the Carpathian foothills, rangin g in expression from naturalistic portrayals to elegantly curving geom etric designs. Snakes m odelled in relief, som etim es vvith fine naturalistic detail, m eander across the inner surface o f dishes dis eovered in gravcs at the D v o ry and Ž ita v o u cem etery o fŽ e le z o v c e , a variant o f the Linear Pottery culture in vvestern S lo vak ia. Sim ilar snakes, but painted in black or brovvn on orange piriform vases, are frequently encountercd during the Late Cucuteni period. The snake coil also appears 011 C ucuteni stam p seals. T h e m ysterious dynam ism o f the snake, its extraordinary vitality and periodic rejuvenation, must have provoked a povverful emotional response in the N eolithic agriculturists, and the snake vvas consequently m ytho!ogized, attributed with a povver that can m ove the entire cosmos. Com positions 011 the shoulders o f cult vases reveal pairs o f snakes vvith opposed heads, ‘ m aking the vvorld ro ll’ vvith the cn ergy o f their spiralling bodies. Tension betvvcen the tvvo is em phasized, since it is not ju st one snake that begins the m ovem ent. This m o tif occurs in various degrees o f sehematization du ring the N eolithic and C h alcolithic eras. T he m ore naturalistic tendency is to distinguish the heads and bodies o f snakes and their tails, vvhich end in vvidespread triangles, a contrivance to fill the space betvveen the discs or ovals. The organization o ft h e m otifs dem onstrates that the im agery is gcnuinely co sm o go n ic: the disc and snake com positions appear in bands occu p yin g the m iddle o ft h e vases, associated vvith belts o f the upper skies containing rain clouds, divine dogs and favvns. T h e b ek o f earth is characterized b y plant motifs. O n som e vases snake coils in the upper bands have diagonal stripes, p robably to indicatc torrents o f rain. In som e cases the snake is portrayed vvinding across the cosmic double-egg.

The involved ornamentation o f Cucuteni and East Balkan cerafflic painting is a sym b olic glorification o f nature’s d ynam ism . Its graphic expression is organized around the sym b ol o f the snake, whose presence vvas a guarantee that nature’s enigm atic cycle w o u ld be maintained and its life-g iv in g povvers not dim inish. T h e snake vvas the vehicle o f im m ortality. Som e vases flaunt a gigan tic snake vvinding or stretehing o ver ‘the vvholc universe’ , o v er the sun or moon, stars and rain torrents; elsevvhere the snake vvinds ab ove or belovv a grovving plant or coils above the pregnant m other’s belly. Snakes coil in concentric circles covering every protuberance, the buttocks as w ell as the fem ale abdom en. The sanctity o f protuberance is indicated b y the special attention given e ve ry co n vcx roundness o f the fem ale b o d y - even a knee is encircled. S im ilarly, the snake is usually present on a bu ll’s rum p or shoulders. The phallus, as vvell as ithyphallic vases and lids, is also accom panied by snake coils. T h e snake vvas stim ulator and guardian o f the spontancous life energy, and this anatom ical association, so frequent that its sym b o lic m eaning cannot be doubted, dem onstrates the povver that vvas attributed to bodily protuberances as its source. In the N eolithic m ound o f Poroditi in M acedonia num erous ceramic snakes vvere diseovered. O riginally they vvere attached to vessels, perhaps vvater containers, used in ritual cerem onies. A reconstruction o f such a vessel is here reproduced. S im ilar snake- or phallus-shaped ‘elongated heads’ have been diseovered in R am ad , Level III, a sixth-m illennium villagc in Syria (Contenson 1 9 7 1 : 285). The phallus, horns, snake, vvater bird, and vvater are closeIy interrelated in m yth and cult. T h e m ystery o f life lies in vvater, in oceans, deep seas, lakes o r rivers. G ods are born from vvater. D io n y sus com es from vvater, as do the B ird Goddess, Athcna, o r A ph rodite. On pictorial Cucuteni vases and Tisza altars vvc sce bird-đavved or horned goddesses borne in the vvomb o f m ythical vvaters. T h e universal snake vvinds around the universal egg like a continuous flovv o f vvater. T o the pocts and philosophers o fa n cie n t Greece vvater vvas the prim ordial elem ent, able to produce life, stimulate its grovvth and nurture it vvith dam p vvarmth. This concept o f the genesis o f the universe from an elem ental aqua-substance surely extends back in time to the N eo lith ic-C h alcolith ic era.

T h e m vthical w ater snake and the vvater bird are vehicles o f an energy w hich has its source in water. In O ld European sym bolism these im ages are intim ately related, as w ili be seen from the next chapter. The snake w inds on the w ings o f a bird and is depieted on the beaked Vinča lid, F ro m the E arly N eo lith ic to ancient Greece the snake appears in an anthropom orphic shape as a Snake Goddess. H er b o d y is usuallv decorated with stripes or snake spirals, while her arms and legs are portrayed as snakes, or she is entwined by one or m ore snakes. H er anthropom orphized im age occurs on vases enveloped b y a snake. On a vase from the N eolithic stratum o f the m ound o f A zm ak in B u l garia, her face is hum an but her eyebrow s resem ble horns. M o n strous horned heads w ith anthropom orphic features and birdclaw ed or snake-like hands reappear in Pre-palatial C rete (cf. A lexio u 1958: Pl. IA , 10). Snake spirals, agglomerations o f snakes or hybrids, half-snake and half-hum an, vvith spiralling extrem ities are painted in black on the cave vvalls o fP o rto Badisco in A pulia (Graziosi 19 7 1).
T h e pr im o r d ia l egg
Stories o f creation knovvn to European and non-European peoples represent stages o f a long process o f developm ent. Because o f their ‘p rim eval’ character they are considered to be very old. The actual record o f this ‘prim ordial stage’ o f creation m yths is lim ited, since not everyw h ere in prehistoric cultures vvere they expressed in images. Ethnological parallels from fishing and hunting societies indirectly prove the Palaeolithic origir. o f the cosm ogonical ideas centring around vvater, vvater bird, egg, doe, and vvoman. During the N eolithic and C halcolithic the stories o f creation vvere quite com plex, as can be seen from vase paintings and frescoes. T h e prim al elem ent o f the universe vvas conceived as vvater. The abstract paintings on Cucuteni vases further reveal the form ation o f the vvorld and the beginning o f life from an egg in the midst o f vvhich a germ resided.

by parallel lines. The sym bol o f life energy - the snake - winds across or around the cosm ic egg. T h e beginning o f life w ithin an egg is eaused b y the orbitin g o f tw o snakes or fav/ns. T he animals are alw ays in opposition, w hich creates a tension. It w o u ld appear that a cross o r an X vvithin an o v a l con veys the same idea. T h e germ is show n as a dot or a le-ns. A lens vvithin the enfolding egg layers is som etim es shown flanked by spirals, a probable association with floral m otifs; this sym bolizes the rudim ent o f a livin g organism taking its form from fio w cr buds or grains. A germ vvithin an egg or a vu lva m ay sprout into a plant w ith buds or vvith bean-like projections. T h e idea o f a prim ordial eg g or vulva is likew ise expressed by sculpture. The Lepenski V ir sandstone sculptures dating from around 6000 b c are alm ost ali egg-shaped and one has a vu lva en graved in the centre. Ancient m ythologies - Egyptian, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek have preserved m yths o f the universe as a cosm ic egg from vvhich gods ariše and vvhich was created by a cosm ic snake or bird. Ancient G reek m yths o b vio u sly enlarge on elements that are closely allied to cosm ological representations on Balkan Neolithic and Chalcolithic ccram ics. A thenagoras in the second century A D recordcd the follo w ing m y th : First ali was vvater. From the w ater em erged a snake with the head o f both a lion and a buli, and between these vvas the face o f a giant, H crakles or K h ronos. T h e G iant created an e gg, and the egg split in tw o . From the upper part čame the sky and from the low er part, the earth (Lukas 1894: 230). Som e 5000 years before Athena goras the m yth could h ave gone like this: First, ali vvas water. From the vvater emerged a cosm ic snake with a horned head. The snake (or the buli, or the giant) created the cosm ic egg. Then the eg g split in tw o. A cosm ic egg m ay also bc laid by a m ythical w ater b ird : this m yth is alm ost u niversally knovvn betwcen A frica and the Arctic zone; it is recorded in ancient civilizations and was kn ow n am ong hunting and fishing tribes. In an A ncient E gyptian m yth , the cosm ic eg g vvas laid b y a N.il.e goose which vvas vvorshipped as the ‘ great chatterer’, the creator o f the w orld. A ccording to the O rphic story, unereated N y x (N ight) existed first and was regarded as a great black-vvingcd bird hovering over a vast darkness. Though unmated, she laid an egg from vvhich flevv go ld -w in ged Eros, vvhile from the tvvo parts o f the shell O uranos and Gaia (H eaven and Earth) were created. T h e beginning o f the m yth must lic in the Palaeolithic era. En graved and sculpted im ages vvith silhouetted egg-shaped buttocks are frequcnt in vvestern and central Europe from the early A u rig nacian and on into the M agdalenian period. The m ore rcalistically rendered figures have bird’s heads and long breasts (Marshack 1972: 3 0 5 rt'.). ■

The idea o fa water bird, or a form ofanthropom orphized bird, as a creator o f the cosm ic egg is clearly represented in N eolithic figurine art. It must have been a dom inating them e am ong the cosm ogonic myths. Vessels taking the fo rm o f a bird are an early tradition in the Balkans. A skoi, vases o f w ater-bird shape, occur at N ea N ikom ed eia, a site w h ich dates from no later than 6000 b c . T h e same tradition vvas follovved th rou gh out the Balkan Peninsula and the D anube region during the sixth m illennium and later. The most peculiar aspect o f these representations is that the ja r is shaped not sim ply in the form o f a bird, but that o f a bird carryin g an eg g w ithin its body. Such a vessel is usually rounded like an egg. W ith the askos, the N eolithic artist expressed a fem ale d ivin ity in the form o f a bird-shaped vvater ja r containing an egg as a fluid substance. She represented the universal Creative force. A nother image having a similar kind o f potentiality is the doe. Vases in the shape o fa deer have an egg-sha ped b o d y . Som e bird-shaped vases rounded to resemble an egg have teriom orph ic heads. Such a peculiar com bination can be seen 011 a vessel from V in ča: the b o d y is shaped like an egg, the neck belongs to a crane or grebe, and the head to a cow or a doe. The sym bolism o f a bird carrying a cosmic egg recurs considerably later, in C yclad ic, M in oan and H elladic art: the bodies o ffly in g birds painted on E arly and M iddle M inoan vases are seen to contain a large egg. In the Palaeolithic period the m y th o f the genesis ofth e vvorld from a cosm ic eg g laid by a bird g ave rise to an im portant series o f so-called steatopygous figurines. T h e nam e is derived from ‘steatopygia’ , w h ich is defined as an excessive developm ent o f fat on the buttocks, especially o f females. Archaeologists erroneously adopted this name for the figurines, thinking that they represented a natural portrayal o f vvom en vvith abn o rm ally large buttocks. This is a false interpretation. ‘ Steatopygous’ images continued from the M agdalcnian cpoch into the N eo lith ic and beyond.

This large grou p o f standing or stooping figurines represents the sculptural realization o f the concept o f the Bird Goddess, abstracting and fusing elements o f hum an and bird form . Her body contains an egg, and even the most schematic representation must be a conventionalized expression o f this idea. From the seventh to the fifth m illennium b c these figurines conservatively display the same fea tures. T h e y are not truly obese; above the vvaist they are univcrsally slender, their breasts o f norm a! or even much reduced siže. Except in v e ry small figurines, the buttocks are usually hollovv and shaped like an e g g . T h e label ‘steatopygous’ is applied also to seated figurines vvhose buttocks are exaggerated and flattened for a practical reason : to balance them on a ehair o r dais. Interest in steatopygia inereased in the nineteenth century vvith the first descriptions o f steatopygous Hottentots and B ushm en, both vvomen and men. H ovvever, H ottentot ladies have no place in the art o f O ld E u rope and it is crroneous and m isleading to describe N eolithic and Chalcolithic figurines as steatopygous. T h e hybridization o f vvoman and bird cndovvs the figures vvith a grcatcr d ignity, the d ign ity o f the supernatural, and it is unfortunate that the term ever bccam c associated vvith Palaeolithic and N eolithic figurines.
T he fish
The usual sym bolism connected vvith the fish ranges from its being an em blem o f the vu lva, or the phallus, to a sym bol o fth e soul or the ‘mystic ship o f life’ . B y microscopic analvsis o f engravings on Late M agdalcnian bone objeets M arshack has reccntly shovvn that fish (salmon) and snake typically appear in the context o f a seasonal m anifestation representative o f earlv spring and frequently in association vvith nevv shoots, yo u n g anim als and ibexcs (M arshack 19 7 2 : i6 yff.). T h e fish is also inseparable from the form o f a phallus since the phallus offers a visual and kinesthetic com parison vvith the fish and snake (cf. a baton head from the G o rg e d ’ Enfer in D o rd o g n e:

id .: 330). A n engraving in the M agdalenian cave o f Lortet shovvs fish nuzzling a reindeer’s gehitals (Hentze 19 32: 113 ). M any thousands o f years later, in G reek G eom etric art, the fish continued to be portrayed hanging on the genitals o fh o rse s; the fish is also placed vvithin 14 1 the w om b o f the Bee Goddess painted on a Boeotian vase around 700 b c . Its role there m ust have been related to the idea o f cyclic regeneration, since the goddess is shovvn in the shape o f a bee and is associated vvith the head o f a sacrificial buli. In N eo lith ic art the fish assumes the shape o f an eg g and is anthropom orphized. T his is exem plified b y the sculptures recently diseovered at Lepenski V ir near the Iron Gates in northern Y u g o sla v ia (S rejo vič 1969). T h ere, in the late seventh and early sixth m illennia b c , fishing and hunting peoples had dug their houses into the bank o f the Danube, houses vvhich had trapezoidal floor plans and con tained rectangular hearths sunk belovv the floor level, lined vvith stones, and outlined vvith thin slabs o f stone set vertically in a pattern o f continuous triangles. Large stone sculptures vvere placed in the lim e-plaster floors in fro n t o f the hearths. F ifty-fo u r o f these m onum ental sculptures, m ost o f them tvvice as large as a hum an head, vvere found, and fifteen o f them reveal half-hum an, half-fish features. G eom etric ornam ent is pecked on m an y o f them, vvhile others are plain. A li appear to possess aspeets o f either the hum an figure, the fish, or the egg, and vvere p rob ab ly seleeted for this reason. The shape o f the river boulder had a significance o fits ovvn; the artist did not alter this, but on ly ga v e it the features o f the m ythical being he venerated. He addcd the m outh and large round eyes o f a fish and 72,73,75.7(> the nose and e ycb ro w s o f a man. T h e m outh vvith dovvnvvarddrooping corners makes the facial features stern, even dram atically tense. B u t it is d oub tful vvhether this painful grim ace vvas really vvhat the Lepenski V ir artist sought to p o rtray; the sternness results from a peculiar com bination o f fish and human features and does not necessarily reflect the artist’s conscious intent. In his book 011 Lepenski V ir, D. Srejovič calls one o f the egg-shaped and fish-faced sculptures ‘ D anubiu s’ . T h e nam e im plies a m ale river d ivin ity, but does the sculpture really represent a male and avve-inspiring god? G eom etric m otifs en graved on stone sculptures, such as zigzags, • 76 interconnected lozenges each vvith a dot in it, chevrons and labyrinthinc designs on round stones vvith depressions (probably used for sacrifice) are related to the sym bolism vvhich appcars on aquatic divinitics associated vvith cosm ogonical im agery. The Lepenski V ir statuary seems to represent a divinity o f a fem inine gender - one o f the sculptures rcproduced here has female brcasts - vvhich ineorporates aspeets o f an egg, a fish and a vvoman and vvhich could have been a prim eval creator or a m ythical ancestress. Standing at the hearth she vvas p robably a guardian o f the house.

O n ly here, in this Danube gorge in the region o f the Iron Gates, have these rem arkable m onumental sculptures so far been found, and they m ay vvell be specifically connected vvith the cult practices o f a people vvhose main concern and subsistence vvas fishing. Fish effigies, hovvever, have been found elsevvhere in the N eo lith ic sites vvhere farm in g activities vvere evident. E ven in the flourishing civilization o f Vinča the fish must have played a part in m ythical im agery, since som e cult vessels vvere form ed in the shape o f a fish. 74



7 Mistresses of VVaters:
the Bird and Snake Goddess
T h e presence o f the B ird and Snake Goddess is felt every w here - on earth, in the skies and beyond the clouds, where prim ordial waters lie. H er abode is beyon d the upper vvaters, i.e., beyond m eandrous labyrinths. She rules over the life-givin g force o f w ater, and her 65 im age is consequently associated w ith w ater containers. O n Cucuteni vases, the goddess’ eyes, or her eyes and beak, appear above represen66 tations o f vvater or falling rain. T h e eyes o f the B ird or Snake Goddess even stare from the v e ry centre o f the w o rld - a sphere vvith a m y thical 67 vvater stream in the centre. H er cosm ic character is emphasized b y 68 a series o f abstract com positions painted on Cucuteni vases. T h e Snake Goddess and the B ird Goddess appear as separate figures and as a single d ivin ity. T h eir functions are so intim ately related that their separate treatm ent is im possible. She is one and she is tw o , som etim es snake, som etim es bird. She is the goddess o f vvaters and air, assum ing the shape o f a snake, a crane, a goose, a duck, a d ivin g bird. T he com bination o f a w ater snake and a w ater bird is a peculiarity o f the O ld European sym bolism representing divine am b ivalen ce.

m ay be related to the ritual o f rain invocation. O n masked Vinča heads or zoom orp hic lids the incised parallel lines m ergin g on the nose ridge and the forehead give an impression o f torrents o f water
running dow n the mask. The ‘cat-headed’ Vinča lids have puzzled archaeologists since the d iscovery o f the V inča site. T h e y certainly do not p ortray cats, since the cat was not knovvn in prehistoric Europe. A re they bears? Birds? The puzzle can be solved on ly by studying ali the accumulated symbols. T h ey have large incised, usually semicircular, human eyes, ears, b ird ’s beak and a V or chevron engraved above the beak. Bands o f striations, punctuated bands, or parallel lines clearly show their connection vvith vvater. T h ey are not given mouths, but some times h ave a round depression belovv the beak, as on m any other bird masks from vvhich ‘ vvater flow s in ali four directions’ . T h e relationship betvveen vvater and the bear is further indicated b y bear-shaped cult vases, abundantly represented in the Danilo, Sesklo, B utm ir and Lengyel cultures. The Danilo bear-shaped vases are solidly covered vvith belts o f zigzags, chevrons and striated diam onds, sym b olic o f flovving vvater. Large pavvs o f bears from the B u tm ir settlement at O bre, probably once part o fa vvater Container, are also decorated vvith incised parallel lines. T he presence throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in Europe and A natolia o f V ’s, chevrons or cross signs on fem ale breasts or im m ediately belovv them, or on arms supporting breasts, suggests an identification o f rain vvith m ilk, an old and vvidespread belief vvhich induced people to see vvomen’s breasts or covv udders in the clouds. T his b e lie f still extant am on g the A rctic hunters points to its origin in Palaeolithic times. V ’s are m arked on the breasts o f a painted clay figu re o f a goddess from shrine V I in C atal H i\yiik (M ellaart 19 67: 18 2, Fig. 50, Plate 79), and m any o f the Proto-Sesklo goddesses o f Thessaly have red-painted V ’s on their breasts or chevrons incised on their hands. There appears to have been an association betvveen a fem ale d ivin ity and divine m oisture from the skies. A beaked figu rin e from Porodin has, in addition to her norm al breasts, breast-like protuberances on the ncck, perhaps to invigorate the influence o f her m agical breasts. T he double-headed B ird Goddess from V inča has breasts m arked vvith V ’s and her body is covered vvith a m eandrous design. A m on g Cucuteni vessels, breasts sprout from basins held by a female figure and from ja rs; they are usually depieted in the centre o f bands or parallel lines sym bolizing rain torrents. T vvo o f the m an y figurines found in the Chalcolithic levels o f the Sitagroi teli in northeastern G reece illustrate the arrangem ent o f these rain- or m ilk-invoking sym bols. U nfortunateIy, they are headless but other East Balkan figurines bearing the same signs have bird heads. N ote that there are three parallel lines betvveen
i i (5
the breasts and chevrons on these figurines; an identical sign o f three lines connected on top b y a horizontal line recurs on the figures in E arly Vinča reliefs. O n the neck o f an anthropom orphic vessel from the B iik k site o f Kenezlo in northeastern H u n gary, there is a mask ■vvith three lines incised betvveen the eyes and three m ore belovv the m outh. T h e body is incised vvith zigzagging and m eandering lines, sim ulating ‘torrents o f vvater’ : tiny arm stumps s.uggest the goddess’ vvings. Signs o f three interconnected lines engraved on human figures are present in the M agdalenian era o f the U p p er Palaeolithic. R ectangles consisting o f three lines connected at the ends appear engraved on a human figure on the bone point from the A b ri M ege at T eyjat (D ordogne). The human im age, probably an abstract rendering o f a goddess, has a tiny head, double ovalo id vu lv a vvith tvvo lines belovv it, a serpentine decoration along the sides and strokes dovvn the legs (Marshack 19 72: 315). The serpentine stroked design along each side seems to be a snake or vvater im age. T h e sym bolic connection vvith the abstract Snake or B ird Goddess im ages o f the N eo lith ic is apparent. C h evro n s (m ultiple V ’s), tvvo, three or m ore parallel lines and a crossed chest band characterize the bird-headed or bird-m asked figurines. These signs are either incised or painted on their masks, heads, arm s o r b o d y. A crossed band vvith chevrons appears incised on the chest o f a bird-shaped figurine from Vinča, and a similar chest-band sign, associated vvith sym bols o f three connected lines, occurs on the body o f a double-headed B ird Goddess. The chestband sign is also found incised on double-headed stands and consistently occurs in com bination vvith chevrons on bird-headed or bird-m asked figurines, clay stamps and flat plaques. A n E arly Vinča anth ropom orph ic lid from Par^a bears, belovv the goddess’ eyes and nose, an X , probably signifying chest bands, and a chevron appears in the upper segm ent. A Tisza pot vvith a spout, p robably used as a libation vase in ritual cerem onies, has the same ideogram incised on one p an e l; a second pauci contains four groups o f three parallel lines and a third panel large meanders. An altar table from Vinča, sup p ortin g a fem ale figure seated in front o f a vessel, p robably portraying a vvater-invocation scene, vvas also decorated vvith V ’s, a chest band and m eander m otifs. U nfortunately, the upper part o f the seated figure is lost. A nother altar table from Fafos portrays a bearor bull-legged altar table. The vvoman holding the vessel seems to be vvearing a mask representing a bear or a bird. The altar is decorated vvith chevrons. A rain-invocation or vvater-divination scene can be recognized in the sculpture from B ord još in northern Y u go slavia, representing a nude vvoman seated on a stool vvith a large basin on her lap. T h e stool is decorated vvith a m eander design. From vvhat follovvs vve shall scc that the m eander sym bolizes vvater.

Vinča statues representing dignified personages, som e seated and som e standing, vvear a discshaped pendant and h ave the m eander sym b ol m arked either on the abdom en or on the back or front o f the skirt.

The front and the back o f the tvvoheaded Vinča goddess from G o m o lava is decorated vvith a large m eander, vvhile a m eander incised on the back o f a vvater bird from V inča refleets its association vvith a bird d ivin ity and vvith vvater. T h e enlarged or double m eander m o tif must have originated as tvvo opposing lines - like tvvo snakcs vvith their heads m ceting but not touching - subsequently elaborated into an enorm ous meander design vvhich appears incised on body, pediment and throne. Double m eanders and double snakcs vvere also incised upon dises. Frequently the m eander is associated vvith striated triangles, chevrons, bands o f parallel lines and sem icircles; zoom orphic lids from Vinča sites and an o v a l plaque from the Vinča settlem ent o f Banjica servc as cxam plcs. T h e double m eander, incised vvith vvhitc-cncrusted lines at the centre o f the latter must have been a sign ofessential im portance in the cult o f the goddesses.

A Linear B tablet (Gg 702) from Knossos, deciphered by Palm er 1- (1965), inform s us that the labyrinth must have been a sym b ol o f the | abode or ‘palače’ o f the ‘ M istress o f the L ab yrin th ’ (da-pu-ri-to-jo; p 0-ti-ni-ja). This palače o r cult place, i.e. the labyrinth, is thought to be depieted on a tablet from Pylos. T h e Pylian ‘labyrin th ’ is m ore com ple* than the meanders o f the Vinča, Gumelni^a, Tisza, Lengyel, Biikk and Cucuteni civilizations, and dates from 2000-3000 years later, but the link betvveen them is nevcrtheless apparent. T h e role o f the labyrinth in gam es and dances vvas still strong in R o m a n , Hellemstic and even later times. Com parison o f the interlaced m ovcments o f an Ancient Greek dance know n as the Ceranos (‘erane’) to the labyrinth strueture (H arrison 1894: C X X V II I) leads to an understandm g o f the connection betvveen the labynnth and its Mistress, the prehistoric Bird Goddess. The erane may have been one o f the incarnations o f a vvater d ivinity, and the N eolithic figurines vvith flattened posteriors, stiff legs and long neeks p robably represent eranes o r vvater birds o f a sim ilar kind. W ater birds vvith long legs and neeks are depieted on Cucuteni vases and similar bird-form s have been found m odelled in clay. Indeed, ali the evidence seems to indicate that the d ivin ity associated vvith the m eander had the attributes o f a vvater bird. Panels o f labyrinthinc design associated vvith gate and vvaterstream sym bols appear on anthropom orphic vases and figurines o f enthroned goddesses from Szegvar, a settlement o f the Tisza cuiture located near Szentes in H u n gary. There is a system atically repeated arrangem ent o f the incised m otifs on these artifacts. T h e b o d y and throne o f the seated Szegvar goddess is covered vvith meanders organized in vertical and horizonta] panels, interspersed vvith parallel vertical lines and narrovv panels o f zigzags. Although the panelled design is suggestive o f a garm ent made up o f m any pieces o f cloth sevvn together, it is unlikely that the entire decorative com position vvas m erely a copy o f an em broidered costume. T h e design appears to sym bolize several levels o f m ythical vvaters. C orresponding sym bolism is encountered on vessels from the Tisza sites o f S zegvar and K o k en y d o m b , cult vases vvhich vvere apparently used in ritual or festivals dedicated to the vvater d ivinity. T h e Szegvar footed vessel is divided by vertical lines into four alternating broad and narrovv panels containing diffcrent patterns o f incised labyrinthine meanders. S ix holes at the top and bottom o f the narrovv front panel must have had some spccial significance associated vvith the funetions o f the goddess. Incised patterns on the cylindrical body o f the vase from K oken ydom b scem to shovv meanders superimposed upon gates. O n the uppcr part o f the cylinder is a sign com posed o f scven horizonta! lines vvith six dots belovv and a vertical line above branehing into three dots 011 top.

The richly incised decoration on the Tisza altar from K o k en ydonib m ay relatc to cosm ogonical myths. Its triangular front is covered by meanders and divided into tw o levcls by a horizontal band o f m eandering lines. In the centre o f the lo w er register tvvo eyes and a nose are set in a triangle. T w o vertical lines above the nose m ay sym bolize horns (a horned Snake Goddess?). G roups o f parallel lines arranged in threcs form panels along each side o f the altar. The decorativc organization suggests several levels o f cosm ic vvaters with the goddess’ abodc or birthplace at the lovvest level. Furtherm ore the triangle m ay represent a schematic rendering o f a female goddess. Sim ilar and sym bolically idcntical designs are found on vvhiteenerusted East Balkan Boian and V.idastra vases and models o f shrines, and on the Cucuteni polych rom e painted w ares from M o ldavia.

The Cucuteni painted vases represent etiological myths, perhaps depieting the birth or abode o f a vvater divinity. This divinity has an 110 anthropom orphic form enclosed in a bracket-shaped design which in turn is contained w ithin a belt o f large rhom bic meanders. This type o f narrative m o tif vvas encountered on several vases from the Traian settlement in northern M oldavia. The reconstructed part o f such a vase shows four large snake meanders and a standing goddess consisting o f tvvo opposed triangles, her figure fram ed b y a closed brackct-like sym bol. The fully reconstructed vase from Traian illustrates the organization o f the cosm os: meanders occu p yin g the upper levels and b elow theni the goddess’ abode vvith her im age fram ed by spiralling snakes. H um an figures consisting o f tvvo triangles and vvith bird -claw ed hands are fam iliar to M inoan art (A lexiou 19 58 : Pl. IA ). These and other com positions conncct the labyrinthine m otifs vvith the m ythical vvater sphere bcyond or belovv vvhich the goddess resides.

birds with long nccks. T h cy unqucstionably have characteristics o f a bird and must be grou p ed together vvith the schematized fem ale figurines or female human and bird hvbrids o f the M agdalcnian Petersfcls type (M arshack 19 7 2 : 284, 306-308) and vvith the N eolithic ‘steato pygo u s’ figurines dcscribcd in the previous ehapter. W ater birds, such as the erane, heron, w ild goose, vvild duck or grebe, vvere sacred to the northern hunting tribes. T ogether with the bear and the elk thcy vvere venerated throughout the prehistory o f northern Eurasia, and in m yth have not lo.st their im portancc to this day. For the northern hunters the vvater bird vvas the m ajor food supply, and
a the vvell-being o f the people depended to a great extent on its regular 1<" V return from the south in the sprmg. T h e d ivim ty sym bolized by a I water bird must have been a giver o f nourishment. Portrayals o f I I S t vvater birds in stone and bone are knovvn from U p p er Palaeolithic I 11 sites in E u ro pe and Siberia. It is the notion o f hybridization o f bird | f I f J and vvoman vvhich led to the creation o f a rig id ly schem atized type 1: ■' found in M ezin and Pctersfels. T h e geom etric signs vvere necessary 1 to invigorate the effectivencss o f these amulets. C h evro n s emphasize P f the avian character, and the meander, the m ythical vvaters or the 1 energy o f vvaters and their mistress, the snake. C h ik alen k o regards the M ezin meanders as a nevv artistic design, hitherto unknovvn to the art o f mankind, vvhich shovvs in graphic form the understanding or feeling o f rhythm and sym m etry. He | further calls this art ‘rh yth m ograph ic’, akin to m usic and dance. ‘In fact, in the beginn ing it is the dance o f a hand upon a sm ooth surface - a hand arm ed vvith a ch ise l-in order to eliminate unvvanted sm oothness. T h en , subsequently, there arises a play, an am usem ent, a spo rt’ (Chikalenko 1953 : 534). H eseesh ereth eb egin n in gofpu reart, vvhere rhythm and sym m etry existed in a most naked form vvith 110 concealed acccssories. ‘T his art’, he says, ‘does not im itate anyth in g in its designs, nor does it express any idea.’ In view o f the consistent and persistent association o f the m eander and the vvater bird and the vvater snake, it is difficult to see mere amusement or sport in the chiselling o f endlcss meanders by the Palaeolithic artist and to concede a com pletely independent discovery, divorced from religious belief, fo r this m otif. I fcel there vvas an inspiration - the ripp lin g o f vvater, the sinuous m ovem ent o fa snake, or a dance im itating vvater birds - and a linking o f the d ivin ity vvith its o w n aquatic sphere. T h e ‘bisexualism ’ o f the vvater-bird d ivin ity is apparent in the emphasis on the long neck o f the bird sym bolicaIly linked vvith the phallus or the snake from U pper Palaeolithic times and onvvards throughout m an y m illennia. This ‘bisexualism ’ m ay derive from the fusion o f tvvo aspeets o f the divinity, that o f a bird and that o f a snake, and not from female and male principles. The im age o fa phallic B ird Goddess dom inates during the seventh and sixth m illennia in the Acgcan area and the Balkans. Som etim es she is a life-like erect phallus vvith small vvings and a posterior o fa vvoman, vvhich, ifseen in profile, is readily identifiable as a b ird ’s body and tail. O r she m ay take the form o f a nude fem ale figurine vvith a disproportionatcly long and m assive neck vvhich ob vio u sly represents a phallus, as in a m arble figurine from Attica. ‘ Bisexualism ’ is refleeted in bird-shaped vases vvith cylindrical necks and in containers shaped like a b ird ’s body attachcd to a female human figurine having a cylindrical head. The concept o f the fusion o f the sexes occasionally rcappears in repre sentations ofherm aphroditic figurines o fth e Vinča culture having

T h e E arly Vinča settlem ent at Anza in M acedonia yielded a num ber o f vases vvith the goddess’ eyes m oulded in re lie f on a cylindrical neck. A li w ere grouped together on the floor o f a house. Associated w ith another house was a vase, 92 cm. high, vvith a goddess’ face engraved and painted on the neck. B e lo w it, a pendant necklace is indicated in relief. T h e body o f the vase was solidly painted in red and cream bands m eeting in the centre. A n overvvhelm ing m ajority o f ali the figurines found in this settlem ent belonged to the standing or enthroned Bird Goddess. She seems to be the most im portant goddess o f the Vinča people since her im age dom inates in ali know n settlements. O fa ll the articulate sculptures from the Vinča site, m ore than forty per cent had ornithom orphic features. T h e goddess’ cpiphany cxprcsscd in bird form fmds its most evocative m anifestation in the fam ous Vinča ‘H yd e vase’ , a gracefully floating duck, vvhich has tvvo rounded protuberances on the top o f its head and wcars a m ask. This askos, about 40 cm. long, is hollovv inside, and its yellow ish -o ran ge vvalls are surprisingly thin. The surface is channelled throughout, apparently im itative o f rippling vvater. W ings and plum age are indicated by raised arehes and black painted bands. Another vase representing the goddess from the same site and phase and h aving a sim ilar rippled surface o f oran gy colour, takes the form o f a standing fem ale vvith b ird ’s posterior and vvearing a large pentagonal mask. Knovvn as the ‘ Venus o f V in ča’, she has hum an breasts, abdom en and legs. Each o f the arm stumps has tvvo

perforations, p robably for the attachm ent o f vvings. A n outstanding ornithom orphic vase unearthed in G rivac in central Y u g o sla v ia , has nearly life-like characteristics o f a bird vvith p lum age indicated b y engraved parallel lines along the w h ole length o f the b o d y, but the stout legs are shaped like those o f a vvoman (Kragujevac M useum ). The missing lid probably bore the masked head o f the goddess. T he eyes and arehed brow -ridges o f the goddess persistently recur on neeks and lids o f East Balkan and Cucuteni vases. T h e num inous nature o f the dom inating eyes, vvhich together vvith the arch o f the eyebrow s and beak o r nose (usually connected vvith the brovv-ridges in the shape o f an anehor or letter T) contribute to the bird-like character, persist throughout several millennia in the archaeological record. T h ey are fam iliar throughout the fourth and third millennia b c and are vvell knovvn from the early settlements o f T ro y . T he ow lish features m ay stem origin ally from the representation o f the horned head o f a snake. A type o f late Vinča figurine o f the Bird Goddess depiets a vvoman vvearing an elaborate dress and a bird ’s mask. W here the mask represents the head ofd u ck or other vvater bird, these became masterpieces o f detail during this period. The chic coiffure o f one East Balkan Bird Goddess consists o fa pony-tail or a peaked cap, others vvear a double spiral or snake coil. A spiralling snake rnay also be engraved on the neck or the upper part o f the b o d y o f a figurine, as for exam ple on the masterful little sculpture o f a masked goddess from Vadastra in R o m an ia. A m eander vvas excised on the back o f her neck and filled vvith vvhite paste. Snake spirals, meanders, dotted bands or parallel horizonta! painted bands often decorate the costume o f the standing or seated Lady Snake. A t ali periods and in ali regions o f O ld Europe one, three or six holes or notehes vvere frequently cut into the throat o f the Snake or Bird Goddess. O ne, three or six holes or notehes (and som etim es seven, perhaps by mistake) also occur on vases decorated vvith meanders or parallel lines sym b olizin g vvater (sce Pls. 77, 10 4 - 10 7 ; Fig. 84). T h ree lines or a vertical line in the m iddle o f the V sign are associated vvith the figurines o f the B ird Goddess on ly (see Pls. 9 3 ,9 5 , 10 5 -10 7 , 1 2 1 ; Figs. 75-77 . 82, 88). The Snake and Bird Goddess usually vvcars three or six necklaces (see Pls. 124 , 1 3 1 ; Figs. 85, 9 1) and three arm rings (see Pl. 12 1) . S ix chevrons cover the upper part o f the gracile Lady o f C ucuteni. The num ber ‘three’ and its duplication apparently possessed a certain sym bolic significancc vvhere the goddess vvas concerned. The M inoan bell-shapeđ idols vvith snake hands on breasts are decorated vvith painted horizonta] bands in groups o f three (Evans, Palače o f Minos, IV , 1, Fig. 12 0 : 7) and, in M inoan and Greek art, three colum ns are associated vvith birds, and vvith Athena.

It is com posed o f three fem inine figures standing 011 a round base and supporting a large vase encircled b y a snake. In each com partm ent betvveen the figures, heads o fra m s vvith large vvinding horns appear (M useum o f Corinth). Proto-C orinthian vases frequently display water-bird figures in association w ith three vertical lines, undulating lines and a net pattern. A B oeotian Snake Goddess dated to 5 7 5 -5 5 0 b c is depieted w ith hair falling on her shoulders in three clusters. Her arms are snakes, her dress and tiara are decorated vvith dotted lines (Higgins 1963 : 3). A snake-headed figurine holding a baby snake (or a lo a fo f bread) from the Hellenistic period in C orinth has a headdress decorated w ith three dises. Each cultural area o f O ld Europe had its ow n m ethod o f p ortraying the Snake and B ird Goddess, but the sym bolic signs and the general conception o f the im age were the same throughout. (For classical representations o f the Vinča civilization, seePls. 9 7 ,12 0 ,12 2 , 1 2 3 ; for those o f the East Balkan civilization, see Pls. 1 2 5 - 1 2 7 ; for those from the Cucuteni and Lengyel cultures, see Pls. 12 8 -13 0 respectively). These exam ples are from contexts w idely separated in time and space, refleeting the pervasive sym bolic im portance o f the ‘L a d y B ir d ’ or ‘L ady Snake’ m o tif in the m ythical im agery o f O ld Europe.

In contrast to the Indo-Europeans, to w h o m Earth vvas the G reat M other, the O ld Europeans created maternal images out o f vvater and air divinities, the Snake and Bird Goddess. A divinity vvho nurtures the w o rld vvith m oisture, g iv in g rain, the divine food vvhich m etaph orically vvas also understood as m other’s m ilk, naturally becam c a nurse or m other. Indeed, the terracotta figurines o f an anth ropom orp h ic snake or bird holding a baby are encountered at various periods and in m an y regions o f O ld Europe, and in M inoan, C y p rio te , and M ycenaean cultures as vvell. This is exem plified by the D im in i seated N urse or M other, striped like a snake and vvith a spiralling snake o ver the abdom en, from the site o f Scsklo, as vvell as by an anthropom orphic figure vvearing a bird mask and holding a baby sim ilarly masked, from Vinča.

this d ivin ity could also be a separate Snake Goddess or B ird Goddess. She is the fem inine principle. . H er status is shovvn by crossed chest bands and a m edallion hung round the neck, as w ell as by an elaborate dress and head-gear. H er avian characteristics are stressed by a forvvard -lean in gor stooping posture, arm stumps vvith perforations fo r the attachm ent o f feathers, letter V signs and m ultiple chevrons o ver her b o d y or m ask. V ’s, chevrons, and crossed chest bands became the ideogram s o f the Bird Goddess and appear on figurines, stands, stamp seals, plaques, cult vessels, altar tables, and other cult objeets. T he snake characteristics vvere emphasized b y parallel or zigzag .lines, dotted bands, and m ost frequently, by snakes spiralling over the body and by a ‘snake-spiral’ coiffure. T h e upper and lovver vvaters vvhich she controlled vvere. repre sented by labyrinthine meanders and snake spirals. As a source o f rain she vvas invoked as docum ented b y the sculptures o f nude rain -in vok in g w o m cn holding large basins, altar tables in the shape o f anim al-m asked vvomen holding vessels, bear-shaped cult vessels, and a persistently rccurring decorative m otif made up o f rain-torrent parallel lines, zigzags, and dotted bands. The bear must have been connected also vvith the m ythical source o f vvater, a m o tif p robably inherited from the Palaeolithic era. R ain -b earin g and m iik -g ivin g m otifs ■vvere intervvoven. R a in torrents and breasts appear on jars and basins used for rain invocation, and the goddess appears as a snake-masked and bird-masked nurse holding a snake- or birdmasked baby. H er abode or birthplace is beyond the upper vvaters. T he epiphany o f this goddess m ainly took the form o f a snake, a vvater bird, a duck, goosc, erane, diver bird, or perhaps an ow l. In sculptural representations she is shovvn as an ornithom orphic vessel vvearing a mask vvith human cyes and a bird ’s beak. H er num inous eyes and a triangular beak, or the snake, appear in cosm ological representations vvhich shovvs that she vvas a Mistress o f life-generating cosm ic forces.

ceased in east central Europe. O nly occasionally does her im age reem erge at the end o f the fourth m illennium and the early third m illennium , notably in T r o y and in the Baden com plex in eastem H ungary. T h e situation was different in M inoan Crete, the Aegean Islands and in ali areas w here M inoan influence was strong, including the Greek mainland. M inoan and M inoan-M ycenaean art generally abounds in birds, snakes, and w om en vvith vvings or w ith snakes craw lin g up their arms or on top o f their heads, the epiphanies and the anthropom orphic im ages o f the goddess inherited from the O ld European pantheon. In the Proto-p alatial period (20 0 0 -170 0 b c ) the Snake and B ird Goddess is a fam iliar representation on cult vases, dishes, and altar tables. She is a beaked lady vvith snake curls or crest on her head and has snake arm s as depieted on a stem o f a round altar table and a dish in Phaistos. Peculiar Pre-palatial (Early M inoan) anthropom orphic vases vvith hollovv breasts, o w l-lik e eyes, and m any necklaces, decorated vvith bands o f zigzags and meanders, as found at M allia (Zervos 19 56 : Fig. 116 ) or M ochlos in eastern Crete (id.: Fig. 187), considered to be ‘divinities o f the sea’ , p rob ab ly originate in the C halcolithic O ld European vvater d ivin ity. D uring the Palatial period in Crete, the M istress o f vvaters appears as a sophisticated lady, best knovvn from the iv o ry and faience statuettes called ‘ Snake Goddesses’, one holdin g snakes. in her hands, another w ith snakes intertw ined around the abdom en and breasts, and both having exposed breasts. T h e snake, like the bird, was a form in vvhich the goddess becam e m anifest. N ilsson in M inoan-Mycenaean Religion provides evidence o f the presence o f idols vvith bird-like attitudes and terra cotta birds in'M inoan shrines (Nilsson 19 50: 33o ff.). T h e large bellshaped idol from the Shrine o f the D ouble A xes at Knossos has a bird perehed upon its head, vvhich p rob ab ly is an im age o f the B ird Goddess. In the shrine o f Gazi, three idols carry birds on their heads. A bird perehes on an earlier Proto-palatial altar from the sanctuary o f the D ove Goddess o f Knossos. Another expression o f the same idea is the small gold m odel o f a shrine from sh aft-gravc IV at M ycenae, vvhere birds perch on the horns o f consecration. There are tvvo pieccs o f gold le a f from shaft-grave III at M ycenae representing a nude vvoman w ith her arms held in front o f her breast. O ne figure has a bird apparently in flight upon her head, the other has birds attached to her elbovvs by their tails. In the shrine o f G ournia in eastern C rete three terracotta birds w erc found togcthei w ith the anthropom orphic im ages o f Snake Goddesses. Three terracotta birds vvere also diseovered in the southvvest w in g o f the palače o f H agia T riadh a. A room at Palaikastro yielded three fem ale figures and a lyre p layer in a grou p w ith six terracotta birds, and on an iv o ry plaque from the same Late M inoan I palače, a beautiful vvinged

f:Wf£- water bird is portrayed vvith a crest o f three feathers (Z ervos 19 56 : | pig, 528). Three small terracotta birds vvere found in the cave at Patso am o n g other vo tive anim al figurines. T h e num ber three, it vvould seem vvas not accidental and vvas indeed connected vvith the m ythical num ber o f three vvhich in the N eolithic and C h alcolithic era is evidenced b y the continuous recurrcnce o f three or six holes on the m outh or neck o f the goddess, or three parallel lines or three chevrons. Birds portrayed on vases are exclusively w atcr fovvl, seagulls, ducks, eranes, or diver birds. Their bodies, vvings or necks are decorated vvith striations and chevrons or snake zigzags (cf. Z e rv o s 1956: Figs. 734 and 738 ; Z ervos 19 5 7 : Fig. 336). Ju g s o f the N eo palatial period o f Crete are shaped like vvater birds and the painted decoration on them is conspicuously sym bolic o f flovving water, including chevrons, striations, bands o f dots and groups o f three vertical lines (cf. Z e rv o s 19 56 : 5 7 1, 727, 729, 7 3 1). M ycenaean art abounds 111 vvinged bird -w o m an im ages and snake-headed figures with round eyes, standing or seated on a throne and frequently vvearing a crow n; during Late M ycenaean (Late H elladic III) times, small terracotta figurines vvith cylindrical bodies and w ings becom e ve ry com m on (M ylonas 1956). The posture o f the standing figures, leaning forvvard, their buttocks naturally upraised or o f the h a lf seated and seated figures, is surprisingly sim ilar to that o f the N eolithic-C halcolithic figurines. Som e o f these M ycenaean figures are multiple, double-headed or double-bodied, a fam iliar trait o f Vinča art. Painted on the figurines are usually vertical, som e times undulating stripes, rem iniscent o f the sym bols o f rain vvater or the sinuous m ovem ent o f vvater snakes on N eolith ic-C h alcolith ic figurines, cult-vases or altars, and thrones vvhich accom m odate seated figures and are decorated vvith striations or undulating patterns. Since these form s and decorative m otifs have no direct antecedents in the earlier M ycenaean (Indo-European) period, their appearance can best be explained as a re-em ergence o f the enduring, local p re-In doEuropean tradition. It is feasible that these form s, vvhich during the in tervening period are absent from the archaeological record, vvere p roduced vvithout a brcak but in a pcrishablc m ate ria l; alternatively, the Snake Goddess and Bird Goddess m ay have been secretly w o rshipped fo r som e tim e after the advent o f the Indo-Europeans, before m anifesting them selves again in graphic and sculptural form at a later date. The Bird Goddess or mcmories o f her original im age continued into the Iron A ge. M eanders and vvater birds re-em erge in the art o f the G eom etric period and the B ird Goddess h erself appears in the 'art o f A ncient Greece as A th e n a ; the b ird -form has been shed but A thena is occasionally vvinged and the bird is her attribute.

or a dove, thereby perpetuating the M inoan-M ycenaean tradition. O n a C o rin th ian aryballos dating from about the beginning o f the sixth century b c , a bird w ith a w o m a n ’s head is shovvn perching behind A thena and at the side o f the goddess is clearly w ritten Fous, a variant form o f a name given to the D iver-bird, Aithuia. In Megara there is a c liff called the c liff o f A thena Aithuia, A thena the D iverbird (Harrison 19 6 1: 303 ; N ilsson 19 50 : 492). In the earliest knovvn vase-painted representation o fth e rape o f Cassandra a large humanheaded bird stands behind the figure o f Athena (JH S 1884: Pl. X L). In the tim e o f A ristophanes it vvas a popular b e lie f that Athena appeared as an o w l in the battle against the Persians. H e sa y s: ‘W e conquered tovvard evening, fo r an ovvl flevv through the ranks before the battle began’ (N ilsson 19 5 0 : 493). A small red -figu re ju g in the L o u vre shovvs the ow l arm ed vvith helm et and spear, vvhile on a blackfigu re vase at U ppsala a b ig o w l perches on the altar tow ards vvhich a ram is led to be sacrificed ( J H S X X X I I , 1 9 1 2 : 174 , Fig. 1). O n a b lack-figu re vase fro m the British M useum a buli is led to sacrifice, follovved b y a procession o f men tovvards the altar on which a bird, a sea-gull or a duck, perches. N e x t to the altar stands Athena, equipped vvith a shield and spear, and behind her is none other than the snake (Stengel 18 9 0 : Pl. I, 4). T h e ram and buli sacrifice to the B ird and Snake Goddess is o f great antiquity, since in the settlements o f the East B alk an and V inča civilizations, cult vases w ith the protom es in the shape o f a ram ’s or bull’s head and figurines portraying a ram 133-135 vvith three(!) horns or a neck decorated vvith groups o f three horizontal lines w ere found in association vvith the im ages o f the B ird and Snake Goddess. A small votive cult vase from Vinča was incised with 136 V ’s and chevrons, the ideogram s o f the B ird Goddess, and so vvas the 13 7 ram -headed vessel from Banjata in B ulgaria. T he anim al’s head vvas incised vvith chevrons and horns - vvith parallel lines. A noth er aspect o f the G reek ovvl vvhich m ay have its beginnings in the N eolithic era is her association vvith the craft o f spinning and hence vvith the sheep. A series o f terracotta plaques shovv an ovvl vvith hum an arms spinning w ool (N ilsson 19 50 : 4 9 3-4 ; an illustration in: B C H X X X I I, 1908: 5 4 1, Pl. V II, 3). A n askos fro m an E a rly H elladic II site at Z y g o u ries near C orinth has a spout form ed in the shape o f a horned ram ’s head (Museum o f Corinth). Portrayals o f Athena on black- or red-figure vases o f Ancient G reece reveal her intim acy not on ly vvith birds but also vvith snakes. A snake craw ls on or is concealed undcr her shield, or appears b y her side, equal in height and m ajesty, as her double (H arrison 19 6 1 : 306). W h y are Athena and the snake related in this w a y ? Is this im agery not an inheritance fro m a deeper antiquity, from times vvhen the cosm ic B ird Goddess had as her counterpart a cosm ic snake? Her association vvith the snake is old and intim ate; the M inoan house
148
goddess also appeared as a snake and as a bird, and the same associations go at least three m illennia farther back. H ow did Athena becom e a goddess o f w ar, vvhile the M inoan and O ld European B ird Goddess vvas not? W h y , too, it m ay be asked, is the eh ief w a r deity o f the Greeks fem ale? T h e ansvver is: Athena, as a direct descendant o f the M inoan palače goddess and as the distant heir o f O ld Europe, becamc Indo-Europeanized and Orientalized during the course o f tvvo m illennia o f Indo-European and Oriental influence in Greece. T h e proteetress o f a city naturally becam e engaged in w ar. T h e nam e Athena is pre-G reek. T h e tovvn Athenai is named after the goddess (Nilsson 1 9 2 1 ; 19 50 : 4898".). ’ A ph rodite U rania, born from the sea, vvas p ortrayed as flying through the air standing or sitting on a goose or being accom panied by three geese in the G reek terracottas o f the sixth and fifth centuries b c ; like A thena, she m aintains certain O ld European features o f the B ird Goddess. H o m er regarded C yp ru s as her true hom e, but prePhoenician C yp ru s vvas vvithin the sphere o f M inoan cuiture. There is strong reason to believe that ‘A p h ro d ite’ vvas a goddess-nam e origin ally com m on to the language o f both islands. It is also believed that the Cretan name ‘ A riadne’ , ‘the very H o ly O n e’ , was an early Hellenic description for Aphrodite herself (Farnell 19 27 : 18). A n d vvho vvas H era, the ob viously un-H ellenic goddess o f the ancient Greeks? In m yths and legends she frequently appears to gether w ith A th ena; the tvvo are almost inseparable or are rivals. In Paestum, the temples o f Athena and Hera štand next to one another. A lth o u gh Hera m arried Zeus (the Indo-European T h und er God) during the B ronze A g e (probably before the thirteenth century since in the Linear B tablets both names appear side by side), archaeological records reveal her as one o f the most revered and pre-em inent god desses. In sanctuaries and pictorial representations, H era is shown in the central position; she occupies the throne, not Zeus vvho stands at her side. T h e sanctuaries dedicated to Hera vvere built in valleys at the estuaries o friv e rs, near the sea, and surrounded by pastureland. Such locations o f Hera tem ples can be observed in Perachora at C orinth, A rgo s in the Peloponnese, 011 the islands o f Sam os and Lesbos, at Foče del Sele in vvestern Italy, Sybaris, and elsevvhere (Sim on 1969: 4of.). She vvas the guardian o f scamen and ruler over the pastureland. T h e vo tive offerings in her sanctuaries include terracotta snakes, horned anim ai figurines, calves, anthropom orphic idols vvith large eyes and decorated vvith spirals and m eanders, and shrine m odels im itating the plan o f a D oric tem ple or an apsidal house vvith vvalls or r o o f decorated vvith bands o f m eandering lines, striations or parallel vertical lines (exam plcs o f the latter from Perachora and A rgo s are reproduced by Sim on 1969: 39). She, ‘ the N oble O n e’ and ‘G iv e r o f AH’, vvas sculpted and described as tali and bcautiful Hera

or R o m a n Ju n o . M o re signiflcantly, H o m er called her fiocbnit,, ‘the c o w -e y e d ’ . H er hair curls like snakes in m any o f her portrayals, and a snake w inds or zigzags vertically in the m iddle o f her skirt (cf. a w ooden re lie f from the H eraion II in Sam os, c. 6 10 b c , Sim on 1969: 50; or the Boeotian bell-shaped idol o f c. 700 B c housed in the Louvre, portrayed w ith lon g snake curls and a panel in front in vvhich the snake as a band o f criss-cross lines is fram ed vvith zigzags and parallel lines and then flanked vvith vvater birds holding snakes in their beaks); or else her an th ropom orp h ic im age vvith cu rly hair, eyebrovvs in the shape o fh o rn s, and upraised hands is flanked b y a snake (as painted on a plaque from a p ro to -A ttic v o tive deposit in a house o f the G eom etric period in G reece: Hesperia 19 33, 2 : 604). A ccordin g to Herodotus, Hera vvas taken o v er b y the G reeks fro m the Pelasgians, the indigenous people in northern G reece. H er nam e, e-ra, as it appears in the Linear B tablet, is not o f In do-E uropean origin. H o m er and Plato connected her nam e vvith the air. Ludvvig Preller in 18 54 in his book on Greek M ythology described H era as a fem inine aspect o f the sky, the air, vvhich encompasses the aspect o f fem ale fertility.

8 The Great Goddess of Life, Death and Regeneration
T h e ‘Fertility G oddess’ or ‘ M oth er G oddess’ is a m ore com plex im age than most people think. She was not only the M other Goddess w h o com m ands fertility, or the Lady o f the Beasts vvho govern s the fecundity o f animals and ali w ild nature, or the frightening M other T errib le, but a com posite im age vvith traits accum ulated from both the pre-agricultural and agricultural eras.. D u rin g the latter she becam e essentially a Goddess o f R egeneration, i.e. a M oon Goddess, produet o f a sedentary, m atrilinear com m unity, encompassing the archetypal iinity and m ultiplicity o f feminine nature. She was giver o f life and ali that prom otes fertility, and at the same tim e she vvas the vvielder o f the destruetive povvers o f nature. The feminine nature, like the m o o n , is ligh t as vvell as dark.
T he an dro g yn ous and co rpulen t goddess w ith folded arms of
th e N eolithic period
T h e N eo lith ic ‘ v irg in ’ is alm ost as corpulent as the Palaeolithic ‘Venus’ , particularly in central Anatolia and around the Aegean. T y p ic a l seventh-m illennium sculptures from G^tal H u yiik in central A natolia take the form o f a massively fat vvoman, either standing or seated, supported by leopards. She usually either holds her hands up to her large breasts or rests them on the heads o f accom panying animals (M ellaart 19 67: 184, Figs. 52, 53). D uring the sixth m illen nium the goddess bccom es m ore vigorous and less obese vvith her shoulders, upper arms and breasts acccntuatcd. The forearm s are folded and the hands are placed on or belovv the breasts. These characteristics are not found on figurines portraying the B ird G od dess. Folded arm s are a characteristic feature o f goddess figurines from the H acilar, Sesklo and Starčevo com plexes o f central Anatolia, the Aegean area and the Balkan Peninsula. Throughout the Neolithic period her head is phallus-shaped suggesting her androgynous nature, and its derivation from Palaeolithic times (cf phallic fem ales: Marshack 1972: 292-93).
Five clay sculptures o f vigorous and fat, but not steatopygous, ladies vvith phallic heads and folded arm s vvere found in the largest early building at N ea N ikom edeia in northern Greece, a settlement dating fro m c. 6300 b c (R odden 19 6 5 : 8 8 ) . T h e content, siže and central location o f the building im p ly its use as a shrine. T h e shrine also yielded three toads carved from green and blue serpentine, prob ab ly representing the shape o f the goddess manifest. O ne o f the best preserved figurines from N ea N ikom edeia is a povverful erect 138 vvoman vvith broad shoulders, folded arms and hands on breasts. The head takes the form o f a sligh tly flattened cylinder vvith a prom inent pinehed-up nose and slit-eyes incised in applied clay eyeballs. T h e hips and buttocks are constru ted from tvvo stout, alm ost cylindrical pieces vvhich vvere m odelled ind ivid ually and pegged together before firing. O n top o fth e fig u re ’s head is a round protuberance suggesting a head-dress similar to the round or conical caps found on Central Anatolian figurines. O ther phallus-shaped heads reveal a circum cision around the top and central hole suggesting that the cylinder 139 head w as m eant to be a phallus and vvas set in a fem ale torso. This type o fh e a d vvas m odelled separately and pegged to the torso before the clay hardened. Som e o f these ‘pillar’ heads have obvious facial features -in cised eyes, pronounccd nose and brovv-ridge, but no m outh. In a num ber o f them the hair is shovvn. A nother category o f phallusshaped heads is characterized b y facial features o f animals. Som e phallic heads are no m ore than blank pillars. A lm ost ali the figurines o f the H am angia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads vvithout any facial features. T h eir deploym ent in graves, and the fold ed -arm posture, suggest an association vvith death or regenera tion. S om e standing figures o f c. 5000 BC vvith huge torsos supported by strong stum p legs and breasts cushioned vvith the arehes o f massive arms are true sculptural masterpieces. The Hamangian figurines are related to sixth-m illennium H acilar sculptures vvhich also have very strong!y built bodies, muscular upper arms, huge abdomens and gf thighs, and folded arms. Elaborate ones vvear a conical cap and full dress. O ne class o f figurines reveals the goddess dressed in a loin đ oth gg and cap, holding a leopard cub. M ainland Greek figurines, as vvell as the H am angian, are form ally related to those found at H acilar, em phasizing the analogies that exist betvveen the European and central Anatolian portrayals o f this god dess. A beautiful long-haired ‘v irg in ’ , her head perfectly preserved, and several fragm entary torsos vvith extrem ely massive shoulders 143 and upper arms vvere found at Sesklo. M any N eolithic m arble figurines in a standing o r seated position from the Aegean area also have phallus-shaped heads vvith or vvithout a prom inent nose.

shoulders, and the huge abdom en o f the marble figurines are typical o f the G reat Goddess. The physical strength o f the fem ale body was an ideal. T h e O ld Europeans never held in esteem the m eagre fem i nine appearance fashionable in our ow n day. The m arble idols w ith long cylindrical necks from the C ycladic islands o f A m o rg o s and N a x o s are usually sitting or squatting vvith arms folded. The most rigidly schematized ones resemble a pear or a violin and have been dubbed ‘ fiddle-shaped idols’ . From the Aegean area num bers o f ve ry schem atic w hite m arble figurines are k n ow n some mere cylinders or cones, and some adjoined to a schematically modelled body (Zervos, 19 63: 34 1, 346, 350). Schematized white m arble figurines are also kn ow n from the N eo lith ic strata in central Bulgaria. T h e beautifully carved sculptures from the m ounds o f Kazanlik and A zm ak have schematized arms and heads and an accentuated supernatural pubic triangle.
T he chrysalid goddess w ith folded arms of th e C halcolithic
period
T he im age o f the goddess vvith arms folded becam e increasingly stereotyped during the fifth and fourth m illennia BC. She is portrayed standing or seated, arms tightly pressed to the body, breasts barely indicated and legs schematized and usually narrow at the end. The masked head has supernatural features. East Balkan sculptures have flattened oval masked heads vvith large sem icircular eyes, a nose, and from tvvo to ten impressions or holes belovv the mouth. Holes on either side o f the head support ear-rings o f copper or gold. C yp riote clay figurines with large pubic triangles from the third m illennium also have enorm ous ears vvith holes for ear-rings. M arble seems to have been especially cherished in B ulgaria as a m aterial for fashioning Great Goddesses, and some marble figurines are over 30 cm. high. Sheet gold was also used for figurines and a fine exam p!e comes from R u se in northern B ulgaria. Regardless o f the m aterial used, clay, bone, m arble, or gold, the G reat Goddess alw ays appeared in a rigid pose, the pose o f a chrysalis. O n ly in cxccptional cases is her appear ance m ore anim ate; the superb figurine from N eolithic Lem a in the eastern Peloponncse reveals a headless nude body o f near!y naturalistic proportions. C ycladic m arble figurines o f the third m illennium b c obviously represent the same divine im age. Their stiffhess betrays the same chrysalid character. Folded arms, small breasts, tapering lifeless legs and supernatural heads continue ideological and stylistic traditions o f several millennia.

Analysis o f the reproduced illustrations o f this goddess reveals only a very gradual stylistic change during the course o f n early fou r m illennia; the im age o f the G reat G oddess remains rem arkablv stable. T o the same catcgorv belong Cucuteni, Vmča and Gumelni^a 1 4 9 - 1 5 1 , j 53 figurines vvith schem atized arms and an accentuated, even enorm ous, iojj pubic triangle. In the East B alkan civilization, particu larly in the Gum elnita com plex, schematized bone figurines with a pubic triangle, ear-ring holes, tw o dots or depressions on the back (trigonum tumbale) p rob ab ly representing eggs, and arm stum ps or ‘perforated arm stumps’ which are stylized renderings o f folded arms, are found in both settlements and graves. G reat Goddess figurines vvere placed in graves sin gly, in pairs or even dozens. Exquisitely decorated vases portraying cosm ological scenes w ere also offered as gifts to the dead. T h e grave inventory from the cem etery o f V yk h vatin tsi in M oldavia yielded five vases, three clay figurines o f the same type, shell beads and a spindlc-w horl. T h e presence o f a spindle-w horl suggests the aspect o f a spinning goddess, i.c. the Goddess o f Fate. T h e spindle is an attribute o f the east M editerranean G reat Goddess and is also an aspect o f Artem is as portrayed on C orinthian vases (Tucker 19 6 3: 56, pl. 20 : 3).

T h e large siže o f m any figurines (in the C yclades som e are nearly 150 cm. high) suggests that they are portrayals o f a goddess. The supernatural triangle and the nudity do not reveal her sexuality. Breasts and belly are not stressed. T h ro u gh the act o f e n gravin g an enorm ous triangle in the centre o f the sculpture the artist perhaps visualized the universai w o m b , the inexhaustible source o f life, to w hich the dead man returns in order to be born again. In this sense t!ie G reat Goddess is the m agician-m other. The folded and pressed arm position (the attitude o f the e m b rvo in the m atrix?) is tvpica! o f the dead buried in the ccm eteries o f O ld Europe. B abies and ehildren squeezed into egg-shaped pithoi for burial had arms tightly pressed to the b.ody, a natural foetal position. A pithos vvas a vvomb as was the grave pit from which the ehild or adult could be born again. For this purposc m iniature vessels filled vvith red colour vvere laid in graves (G eorgiev and A n g e lo v , Ruse, 19 5 7 : 127).

The beginning o f the concept o f continuous life/death duality and o f d ivine am bivalence as expressed in ancient G reek m ythical im ages such as H ekate-A rtem is, D em eter-K o re or Persephone, goes back to the N eo lith ic-C h alco lith ic era. D o uble figurines in C ycla d ic art, in vvhich a baby stands on top o fa norm al-sized sculpture are connected w ith the idea o f rebirth (Thim m e 1965, 7 1). There are m any sculp tures vvith double heads or m other-and-daughter figures in each category o f goddesses (cf. Pls. 86, 90, 100, 10 1).
T h e m a g ic a l s o u r c e o f life w it h in t h e g o d d e s s : her m o u t h ,
h and s an d eggs
A n anth ropom orph ic vase standing on stout legs from Sultana in Southern R o m a n ia is interesting because o f its painted sym bolic designs. It is 32.3 cm . high and has huge sem icircular eyes, beak-nose, large ears with holes for ear-rings and a m outh vvith ten round impressed holes, and rings indicatcd in vvhite paint. T h e holes, vvhich are o f various sizes w ith the largest near the m iddle, are ostensibly meant to suggest panpipes, the rings being added for decoration. The arms are rendered ve ry schem atically but the three fm gers o f the left hand are held to the m usical instrum ent. T h e focal point is the abdom inal area vvhich depicts a vu lva vvith three rings on top, flanked by crescents, ali extravagan tly painted in w hite. O n the back are painted tw o enormous eggs. A negative design o f four-fm gered hands is depieted on the back o f the neck, and spirals decorate the back o f the head. This arriazing accumulation o f sym bols sheds more light on the nature o f the goddess than m any schematized clay or bone figurines. From this vase, a representation o f the w o m b o f the Great M oth er, w e learn that the goddess vvas also a m usician holding panpipes adorned vvith rings. As the possessor ofth e secret o f life, her music or utteranccs must have had m agic and binding significance. A n oth er anthropom orphic vase from the G um elnifa settlement o f V idra is a bu lky Container, 42.5 cm. high, m ade in the im age o f the goddess vvith folded arms and hands belovv the breasts. T h e goddess’ head is not apparent but was p robably ineorporated in the lid, vvhich is m issing. Concentric circles or circles vvithin lozenges are inciscd and vvhite-encrusted in the area o f the navel, on both sides o f the pubic triangle, o ver the buttocks and hips and in the m iddle o f the neck. T h e hands and the incised circles and lozenges must have had sym b olic significance. G lobular vases vvith m agical hands on the belly are knovvn from Hacilar (M ellaart 1970), from the ProtoSesklo com plex in Thessaly (Theocharis 19 6 7: 1 5 1 , Figs. 87 and 88), from the Starčevo com p lex in Y u go sIavia (the Anza site in M acedonia), and from Lepenski V ir 011 the Danube (Srejovič 19 69: Pl.

The persistence o f m agical hands either sculptured in relief or painted is a continuing tradition fo r several thousands o f years. In the East B alkan civilization in particular, the large four-fingered hands occur in re lie f or are painted on large vases h avin g a h ypn o tic quality. Superposed stylized figures vvith enorm ous arms and hands are show n on a Cucuteni vase from Petreni; they occupy the entire height o f the frieze, alternating vvith quartered discs and rain torrents (R y b a k o v 19 6 5: Fig. 36). Vinča and East Balkan figurines o f w om en in squatting position vvith emphasized upraised egg-shaped thighs evidently depict a natural birth-giving position. The masked vvoman in a contracted position from the Vinča settlement o f M edvednjak, southeast o f B elgrade, has one hand lifted to the m outh, in the m anner o f the Goddess o f Sultana. Incised on the buttocks and thighs are spiral lines and circles vvith a dot in the m iddle. A small sculpture from Cascioarele in Southern R o m a n ia shovvs a vvoman in n early identical squatting position (D um itrescu, 19 66 : Pl. 88). A beautifully m oulded fem ale figurine sitting on a stool shaped like an exposed vu lv a vvas unearthed during the 19 7 1 excavation in D renovac, a V inča site at S vetozarevo in central Y u g o sla v ia . A Pre-palatial pot from M allia in C rete has incised on it a likeness o f the naked goddess vvith legs spread to shovv the pudenda (A lexiou 1969: 85). T he exposure o fth e genital region must have been sym bolic o f birth-giving. The pregnant vvom b is conspicuously absent in representations o f the goddess in her birth-giving funetion. The tvvo large eggs or circles on the back o f the body o f the Great Goddess represent her potential. T h ey štand for the source o f subsequent developm ent and thus could be called sym bols o f ‘becom ing’. T h e eg g is readily observable on vases that vvere p robably connected vvith the cult o f the Great Goddess. A n th rop om orp h ic vases have egg-shaped thighs and buttocks. Lids, dishes, bovvls and jars are incised o r painted vvith eg g m otifs, and pots frequently have a doubleeg g shape. T y p ic a lly Cucutenian are the so-called binocular vases. In ali p robability they served in rituals dedicated to the G reat G oddess; sym bolic figures depieted on them inciude dogs, deer and moon crcscents, her constant companions. T h e d ouble-egg sym b ol found on the back or the front o f the East Balkan and C ucuteni figurines is one o f the m ost frequently encountered. The tvvo dotsjust above the buttocks (knovvn to Science as trigonum lumbalc) m ay have originated the idea ofsh ovvin g the eggs in this particular place. I f such a figurine is scctioncd one actually finds a double-egg inside. T h cy štand herc for a universal life source, not for human foetuses. Countless anthropom orphic vases carry the tw in egg sym b ol and it is found,. in abstract com positions, on large C u cu teni vases. This sym b ol is associated vvith or surrounded b y vvater

goddess. T h e sectioned egg m o tif is firm ly w o ve n into the ornam ental pattern o f vase decoration. In the fourth m illennium b c , the conju nction o f the egg, double-egg, lens, crescent, snake, and spiral m otifs on vases o f the Cucuteni civilization reached a rare level o f exquisite design.

T h e m enacing dogs ob viously belonged to the M oon Goddess w ho, like the nightm arish Hekate o f early historic times, was w o rshipped by dogs barking at the m oon, and whose principal sacrificial anim ai was the dog. T h eir lunar character is stressed b y crescents depieted around or below the figures o f dogs.. O ther Cucuteni vases display processions o f dogs, a deer, a billy goat, a nanny goat, and a w o o lly Caterpillar in the ‘upper sp h ere’ above the main zone in the centre o f the vase, the central m o tif o f w hich is the sectioned e g g and the id eogram o f the G reat Goddess. D o gs are portrayed leaping high on either side o f a tree, perhaps a life-tree, the sym bol o f ali life, w ild and cultivated. The representations o f the life-tree guarded b y ferocious animals on Cucuteni vases are the earliest in European art, and later persisted through ali o f prehistoric and early historic times. The guardian dogs, how ever, w ere replaced by lions, he-goats or other male animals. In folklore, the O ld European m ythical dog has lasted to this day. In the B alk an countries it is believed that eclipses o f the sun and m oon are caused b y dog-headed monsters. In M acedonia, a Chetvorok, a dog w ith a w horl o f hair over each eye, m aking him appear fou r-eyed , is the enem y o f a vam pire. H ence w e have several aspeets o f the d o g : dangerous, nocturnal and punitive on the one hand, and a proteetor against the forces o f evil on the other. T h e northern European b e lie f in the existence o f a corn špirit in the shape o f a d o g or w o lf m ay also have originated in the N eolithic period. In fact, d o g ’s original role in m yth m ay ve ry w ell be derived from its im portance as a guardian, proteeting m an’s hom e, his seedlings and young crops against the early farm ers’ ow n herds and w ild animals - as was righ tly observed b y B o gaevskij (1937) and after him b y R yb ak o v (1965).
2 The doe, a double o f the Goddess o f Regeneration
The prestige o f the deer in sym bolism is not sim ply connected vvith its appearance - beauty, grace, agility - but also w ith the phenom enon o f the cycle o f regeneration and grow th o fits antlers. T h e latter aspect lay deep in the m ind o f N eolithic peasants. D e er’s antlers play an im portant ro le : reliefs o f stags vvith enorm ous antlers are frequent on vases o f the Starčevo co m plcx. Even in m iniature figurine art there w ere attempts to p ortray stags. T h e role o f a deer in O ld E u ro pean m yth vvas not a creation o f N eolithic agriculturists. T h e im portance o f a pregnant doe must have been inherited from a preagricultural era. The northern people in the hunting stage still believe in the m other o f the universe as a doe-elk or w ild reindeer-doc. M yths speak o f pregnant w o m en w h o rule the vvorld and vvho look like d e e r: covered vvith hair and vvith branehing deer’s horns on their heads (A n isim ov 19 5 9 : 28, 4 9 ff.; R y b a k o v 1965, 2 :35 ). In the U p p er Paleolithic era, sim ilar im ages probably existed ali o ver Europe.

E xcep tion ally beautiful are cult vases in the shape o f a doe. O utstanding is the large vase from M u ld ava in central B u lgaria.

As an anim al sacred to A rtem is and Diana, the doe continued to be sculpted in ancient G reece and R o m e (Hoehn 19 46 : Pls. III, V , V I, Figs 17 and 2 1). T h e b o d y o f the doe o f M u ld ava is decorated with crcscents in a negative d esig n ; hence the anim al is shovvn to be cIosely related to the m oon sym bolism .

elief of'Birth-giving s’ on a pottery cnt from Sarvaš, ’rn Yugoslavia. ■Balkan Neolithic. ' sixth millennium
The life-givin g goddess, her legs w idely parted, appears in relief on the vvalls o f £ a ta l H u y u k shrines, frequently in association vvith bulls’ heads or bulls’ horns (Mellaart 1967: 102-3, 109, 115 - 16 , 127, 13 4 - 3 5 ) . B u lls’ heads vvith enorm ous horns, or the horns alone, w ere attached to vvalls or to special pedim ents, and in several shrines one or m ore huge buli heads w ere placed ju st b elo w the goddess as i f to assert and strengthen her pow ers. T h e b elly o f the goddess is usually m arked vvith a circle or concentric circles. A lthough no shrines o f com parab le antiquity or State o f preservation have been found in Europe, it can be surmised from reliefs o f the goddess vvith upraised arms and outstretched legs on sixth-m illennium vases o f the ProtoSesklo and Starčevo com plexes that her im age vvas as frequent there as in A natolia. T h e re lie f o f a figure vvith w id ely parted legs and upraised arm s on a Starčevo potsherd from the site o f Sarvaš in northern Y u go slav ia is undoubtedly related id eolo gically to the Catal H uyiik shrine reliefs. Pottery bearing reliefs or incised repre sentations o f figures vvith upraised arms and parted legs is found from Thessaly and M acedonia to northern H ungary and G erm any, vvhere the goddess is schem atically en graved on vessels o f the B iik k and Linear Danubian com plexes o f the fifth m illennium b c (many illustrations o f these are given by G ulder 1962).

m o tif on central European Linear Danubian pots is so frequent that B u tler in his m onograp h o f 1938 assumed this creature to be ‘sacred’ (Butler 19 38: 56). T hat the upraised arms and outstretched legs had a m agical significance is evident from pottery reliefs o f tw o figures associated vvith snakes on a Vinča vase from G o m o lava. Parted legs and pubic triangle, in shorthand resembling the letter M , became the ideogram o f the Great Goddess. The M sign occurs on vases, engraved or painted, and in com bination vvith the im age o f the goddess’ face on pithoi from Szentes in southeastern H u n gary. The face, incised on the neck o f the pithos, is flanked by snakes. T h e handle ends are m odelled as upraised hum an arms and a small M sign is incised on the underside o f each arm , belovv the hand. Vases bearing such representations in engravings or reliefs could have played a part in the cult o f the dead. T h e m ysterious p ow er o ver life processes vvhich the toad is thought to possess consistently recurs in the consciousness o f the European people long after the dissolution o f O ld Europe. Thus the toad appears painted on amphorae o f Palatial Crete. O f particular interest is the ‘L ady T o a d ’ from Maissau, a Bronze A g e urnfield in lovver Austria, vvhich dates from around 110 0 b c (Gulder 1962). This terracotta has a human face, female breasts and an exposed vu lva on the underside o f the nearly naturalistically portrayed animai. Terracotta, bronze, amber and ivory toads are knovvn from Etruscan, Greek and R o m a n sanctuaries and graves. A bronze sculpture o f a toad vvith an inscription vvas found as a vo tive offering at C orinth and a beautiful tiny figurine o f a toad carved out o fa m b e r vvas diseovered in a grave at Vetulonia at P o g g io alla G uardia in Italy. Its being carved in am ber, an im ported and expensive m aterial, proves the high esteem in vvhich the toad vvas held during the Early Iron A ge. Ivories from the sixth-century b c sanctuary o f A rtem is O rthia at Sparta in the Peloponnese inelude toads and turtles as vo tive offerings. T h e turtle cult vvas no less ancient and significant than the toad ’s: a terracotta turtle vvas found in Vinča and another com es from D im ini at V olos in Thessaly (N ational M useum , Athcns 3 7 : 6019). A t G rivac, a Vinča site in central Y u g o slavia, a representation o f a turtle vvith a p ig ’s head čam e to light (Kragujevac M useum , Inv. 4, 288). T oad s made o f w a x , iron, silver and vvood are to be found to this day as vo tive offerings to the V irgin M ary in ehurehes in Bavaria, Austria, H ungary, M oravia and Yugoslavia; cthnographers have recorded m ore than a hundred instances in Bavaria alone (Gulder 19 6 2 :2 6 ).

pains, toad’s blood was used as an aphrodisiac and d ry toads were hung up to protect the house against ali evil. Such beliefs suggest a benevolent goddess, but the toad as a nocturnal and m ysterious creature can cause madness, can take a w a y the m ilk and suck the blood from humans w hile they sleep. In Baltic and Slavic (i.e. IndoEuropean) m ythologies, she is the main incarnation o f the chthonic m agician goddess. In the Indo-Europcan m yth ologies she is basically an incarnation o f a goddess o f death, w h ile in the south, w h ere O ld European (i.e. pre-Indo-European) m ythology was firm ly rooted, the m ost prcvalent beliefs conccrning the toad are those connected vvith birth, pregnancv or tlie w o m b (uterus). European peasants still speak about a travelling uterus in the w o m a n ’s body. Sim ilar beliefs are recorded in Greek and R o m a n times. H ippocrates, Plato and Aristotle com pared the uterus to an anim al vvhich m oves in the lo w er part o f a vvom an’s b o d y (Blind 19 0 2: 69; G u ld cr 19 62: 36). I f this anim al is not satisfied, it m ay rnove up and hinder breathing, and cause fright or other disorders.

Egyptians also knevv o f the travelling uterus (R einhard 1 9 1 7 : 340). W h o is this anim al m o vin g about in a w o m a n ’s b o d y ? Equipped w ith docum entation from present folk, medieval, Greek, R o m an and E gyp tian beliefs, G uld er (1962) in his treadse on the M aissau toad presented a very convincing interpretation: this m ysterious anim al, must, he concluded, be a toad. The foetus was a toad which crawled into the w o m b (the real cause o f conception w as not knovvn in prehistory). N eo lith ic or even U p p er Palaeolithic m an m ust have seen the hum an e m b ryo at the age o f one or tvvo m onths: it is about 3.5 cm. in length, has a big head, tvvo dark points fo r eyes, black holes for a nose, tw o depressions for ears, a long opening for the m outh and stumps for arms and legs. Such a creature can easily be taken for a toad ! A n d this is w h at apparently happened far back in time, p robably m ore than ten thousand years ago, and the belief has still not com pletely died out. T he idea that a toad causes pregnancy m ay have originated before the N eolithic period since representations o f toads (or lizards) engraved on bone artifacts are knovvn from the M esolithic M aglem ose culture.

a nocturnal anim ai; it does not em erge during d ayligh t and when startled in its n ightly forages it rolls itself up in a bali, from w hich sharp spines stick out in every direetion. N o w o n d er it is endovved w ith magical powers. A key to understanding w h y the Great Goddess ehose the hedge hog as her double again lies in parallels o f e x -v o to im ages. In Southern T iro l, instead o f an im itation toad, a so-called Stachelkugel, a ‘spiky bali’ , was brought to ehurehes or chapels and also placed in graves. Such balls made o f w ood and painted red, are usualiy 8 -19 cm. across, round or oval in shape, and are called ‘uteri’. A bout fifty years ago m any such Stachelkugeln w ere to be seen; n o w on ly old ones still remain (Gulder 19 62: 25). The prototype possibly derives from the uterus o f a cow , vvhich after parturition remains swollen and covered vvith warts (know n in G erm an as ‘ Igeln’ , ‘hedgeh ogs’). Indeed in som e areas o f Southern T iro l the c o w ’s uterus is called ‘Igelkalb’, ‘hedgehog’s c a lf’ (i d 30). The association o f a c o w ’ s uterus w ith the hedgehog is certainly not recent and m ay date from the period o f the beginning o f anim ai dom estication. T h e arehaeological evidence shows the G reat G oddess’ epiphany in the form o f a hedgeh og to be not later than the fifth m illennium b c . V o tive offerings in the shape o f a uterus - fiat and oval đ a y objeets w ith a ridged surface - occur am ong the Etruscan and R o m a n antiquities.
3 The bee and the butterfly: the bull-born Goddess o f Transformatiort and Regeneration
B efo re w e discuss the epiphany o f the G reat Goddess in the shape o f a bee or a butterfly w e must mention the ancient b elief that bees are begotten o f bulls. O ne o f the earliest writers to mention the bullborn bee is A ntigonos o f K arystos, about 250 BC, w h o says:
In Egypt if you bury the ox in certain places, so that only his horns project above the ground and then saw them off, they say that bees fiy out; for the ox putrefies and is resolved into bees. (Antigonos, Hist. mir. 19 ; quoted by Cook Zeus I, 514 ; Ransome 1937: 114).
T h e m ost appropriate tim e fo r this m ethod o f reproducing bees vvas said to be w hen the sun entered the sign o f the buli (Taurus). N e a rly three centuries later O vid speaks o f Aristaeus, the ‘H oney L ord ’ w h o vvas w eep in g because ali his bees had died, leaving the honeycom bs unfmished. O n the advice o f his m other he captured Proteus, the m agician, w h o told Aristaeus ‘that he must bury the carcase o f a slaughtered o x, and that from it he w o uld obtain w hat he wanted, fo r w hen the carcase decayed, sw arm s o f bees vvould issue from it. T h e dcath o f one produccd a thousand lives’ . (O vid , Fasti I, 39 3; quoted b y R an som e 19 3 7 : 112 ) . In his fourth Georgic, V crg il (7 0 -19

bc) likew ise recounts this m ethod o f obtaining the ox-born bees. A further explanation o f vital im portance is given b y P o rp h y ry (a d 233 to c. 304), w h o w rites:
The ancients gave the name o f Melissae (‘bees’) to the priestesses o f Demeter who were initiates ofthe chthonian goddess; the name Melitodes to Kore herself: the moon (Artemis) too, whose province it was to bring to the birth, they called Melissa, because the moon being a buli and its ascension the buli, bees are begotten ofbulls. And souls thatpass to the earth are bull-begotten. [M y italics] (Porphyry, De ant. nym. : 18; quoted by Ransome 1937: 107).
From this passage w e learn that A rtem is is a bee, M elissa, and that both she and the buli belong to the m oon. Hence both are connected vvith the idea o f a periodic regeneration. W e also learn that souls are bees and that M elissa dravvs souls dovvn to be born. T h e idea o f a ‘life in death’ in this sin gu larly interesting concept is expressed b y the belief that the life o f the buli passed into that o f the bees. H ere w e have the v e ry essence o f the m eaning o f sacrifice vvhich is also applicable to N eo lith ic and C h alcolithic Europe as vvell as to the M inoan civilization. The im age o f the Great Goddess in the shape o f a bee appears on the head o f a buli carved out o f bone from the Late Cucuteni site o f Bilcze Z lote in the vvestern U kraine. H er upraised and bifurcated arms are defm itely those o f a bee. H er head is a dot and the conical lovver b o d y (vvithout indication o f legs) is clearly an im itation o f a bee’s b o d y. Sim ilar representations, though less schem atized, are knovvn from M inoan, M ycenaean, Geom etric and Archaic Greek art. M any gold rings o f M inoan vvorkmanship from Crete and Greece p ortray the bee-headed goddess or the same goddess h old in g bu ll’s horns above her head. A steatite bead-seal from Kašteli Pedeada, southeast o f Knossos, shovvs the goddess vvith legs parted and a long conical projection vvhich o b vio u sly is the lovver part o f the b o d y o f a bee. H er arm s are upraised and the head is hum an. T h e other side o f this seal portrays a bu ll’s head. Greek jevvelry o f the seventh to fifth centuries b c fro m R h o d e s and Thera includes gold plaques o f the ‘ B ee-G o d d ess’ . She has a pair o f ‘hands’ in addition to her vvings, and there is a rosette on either side o f her ridged abdom en. T h e fam ous painted B oeotian am phora dating from c. 700 b c portrays the ‘ Lady o f the W ild T h in g s’ , or the ‘ Mistress o f A n im als’ , as she is usually called, flanked by tvvo lions, a (decapitated) bull’s head, a bottleshapcd object (a uterus?), birds and svvastikas. It is significant that she has the arm s o f an insect. Z ig z a g g in g hair and a serrated line around the lovver part o f the body suggest the hairy b o d y o f a bee. In this casc the titles ‘ M istress o f A n im als’ or the ‘L ady o f the W ild T h in g s’ are
182
m isleading. She is here the ‘Goddess o f Periodic R e g e n eratio n ’ . She is shovvn vvith a fish inside her, a sym b ol o f fecundity related to vvater. T h e loose bull’s head is that o f a sacrificed buli. T h e buli is dead and the nevv life begins. T h e svvastikas (vvheels, concentric circles, rosettes) turn, the snakes era w l, the beasts hovvl (by the m iddle o f the third m illennium b c lions had replaced the m ore ancient dogs). T h e epiph an y o f the goddess is inseparable from the noise o f hovvling and clashing, and the vvhirling dances. Kuretes, the male devotees o f the goddess, dance vigo ro u sly, ‘rattling their arm s’ as C allim achus, the G reek poet o f c. 260 b c , says in his Hymn to Jo v e : 32. V erg il, describing the noise made to attract svvarming bees, says ‘they clash the cym bals o f the G reat-M o th er’ (V e rg il’s fourth Georgic: 63). A t Ephesus, A rtem is vvas associated vvith the bee as her cult anim al. In fact, the vvhole organization o f the sanctuary in classical tim es seems to have rested on the sym b olic analogy o f a beehive, vvith svvarms o f priestesses called bees, melissai, and num erous eunuch priests called ‘drones’ , essertes (Barnett 19 56 : 218). W h y vvas the bee ehosen for the sym bol o f regeneration? W e m ay ask the same question vvhere the Egyptian beetle or scarab is conccrn ed; it too sym bolizes the m oon and eternal renevval. The reason p robably is because both have antennae like buli horns and vvings in the form o f a lunar crescent. T h e periodic svvarm ing and buzzing o f bees, vvhen a nevv generation is born, and the Creative activity associated vvith the produetion o f honey must h ave greatly im pressed our forefathers vvho regarded it as the food o f the gods. This is suggestcd by the fam ous gold pendant from a tom b at M allia in C rete dating from the early sccond m illcnnium b c , a superb piccc o f M inoan goldvvork, in vvhich tvvo bees hold a h on eycom b in the shape o f a disc. T h ree other discs are suspended 011 the vvings and at the point vvhere the bodies o f the tvvo b eesjoin (M atz 19 6 2 : 126). Knovvn portrayals o f bees from antiquity are made o f metal, usually gold, or take the form o f engravings, reliefs and paintings.

portrayals o f schematized toads or ‘dancing figures’. The im age o f the goddess in the shape o f a bee or some other kind o f insect has a verv long h isto ry: earlicst representations occur in the Neolithic P roto-Sesklo and Starčevo com plexes. A creature vvith w in g-lik e arms and a protruding cone betvveen the parted legs painted in cherry red on a w h ite background on a ja r from O tzaki, a P ro to -Sesk lo site in Thessaly, m ay be one o f the earliest representations o f a ‘Lady B ee’ . Schem atic figures vvith upraised arms and bifurcated heads have long been k n ow n in the Starčevo com plex o f H u n gary. W hat m ay be a headless bee appears in re lie f on a large vessel fro m the same site o f Kopancs. Headless bees portrayed on rosettes are knovvn from the A rtem isium o f Ephesus (m ore than 5000 years later) w here they vvere p robably used as eharms. In R o m a n times, headless bees to gether w ith headless toads also occur on rosettes used as talismans to avert the evil eye (R an som e 19 3 7 : 110 ). A figure o f a goddess in the shape o f a bee (?) is painted in red on a Tisza dish from Ilonapart at Szentes. Her bee-like attributes are a bifurcated insect-type head, legs and a sting (‘a tail’). Schem atized figures o f bees, h aving the characteristic ridged body, are quite frequent on Linear pottery. A n alogo u s representations often appear in relief on C ucuteni vases. O n a M ycenaean gem o f M inoan vvorkm anship tvvo lion-headed genii clad in bee skins hold ju g s o ver horns from w hich a new life springs in the shape o fa plant. W hat do these ju g s c o n ta in ? -p ro b a b ly ‘foo d o f the gods’ produced by the bee. T h at mead vvas used as a libation is w cll knovvn from Classical G reek w riters. Sacrificial honcy vvas am ong the ‘sober o fferin gs’, the nephalia, but it was also knovvn as an intoxicant. H oney w as alw ays considered to be a food that conduces to a long and healthy life. Pythagoras, vvhosc life spanned the grcater part o f the sixth century b c attributed his lo n gevity to a constant use o f h oney in his dict. H on ey was a healing substance. Glaucus, the son o f M inos and Pasiphae, vvas restored to life when buried in a h oncy ja r. T h e apiculture o f the M inoans is docum cntcd b y hieroglyphs, representations ofactual beehives, engraved images, and myths. The Greeks, w h o like the rest o f the Indo-Europeans knew on ly o f wild honey, inherited bee-kecping from the M inoans. T h ey borrovved
i«4
even the m ost im portant nam es: sphex (‘bee’), simblos (‘h iv e ’) and propolis (‘kerinthos’) (R ansom e 19 3 7 : 64). T h e y also inherited the m ythical im age o f the G reat Goddess as a bee, the Goddess o f R egen eratio n , the im age o f her virgin priestesses or nym phs as bees, and m any other m yths and beliefs connected with the bee and honey. T h e Cretans on the other hand, must have held bees in high esteem from the beginning o f the N eolithic era. T h e fact that w e have been considering the bee rather than the butterfly does not im p ly that in ancient m y th o lo g y the bee vvas the m ore im portant o fth e t w o ; both vvere equally ancient and essential in the sym b olism associated w ith the goddess. The difficulty is that in schem atic prehistoric reliefs or paintings o f the goddess vve can recognize little m ore than an insect head or insect hands. W hether she is ‘L a d y B e e ’ or ‘L ad y B u tterfly’ cannot be determ ined. In most N eolithic reliefs, such as that from K otacpart, the im age o f the goddess can be interpreted as representing either a bee or a butterfly. The scene on the gold ring from the grave o f Isopata near Knossos, dating from c. 1500 b c , ineludes four fem ale figures in festival attire, perhaps portraying the goddess and her devotees, usually assumcd to be melissae, or bees. T h eir heads and hands are certainly those o f an insect, but vve cannot be sure o f vvhat kind.

T h e m otifs o f chrysalises, buttcrflics, and ‘d ou ble-axes’ are vvell knovvn to the student o f M inoan-M ycenaean art. It vvas indeed Sir A rth u r Evans vvho published a series o f chrysalises, buttcrflics, and goddesses related to chrysalises or vvith butterfly vvings (Evans 1925). H e interpreted the chrysalis as an em blem o f a nevv life after death. C o m m o n vvhite and other species vvith eyed, indented vvings occur repeatedly in M in o an and M ycenaean art. In a cham ber tom b at M ycen ae a detailed exam ple in the form o f a gold chrysalis bead vvas found b y A . J . B . W ace. It has eyes, and the vving cases and articulation o f the abdom en are indicated. In Sh aft-grave III at M ycenae, Schliem ann diseovered go ld pendants in the shape o f chrysalises associated vvith golden butterflies, as w ell as butterflies em bossed on the plates o f vvhat had been scales (Evans 19 2 5 : 56, Fig. 48a and b : 59, Fig. 52). T h e M ycen aean butterflies are an inheritance fro m M inoan Crete, vvhere they are knovvn from the M iddle M inoan III and later periods. A seal from Z a k ro in eastern C rete reveals the goddess vvith a hum an head, large vvings o f an ‘eyed ’ butterfly, and anim al or bird
legs. T h e epiphany o f the goddess in the shape o f a butterfly in M inoan-M ycenaean religion cannot be doubted. W e m ay ask novv hovv far back she can be traced. A n upper torso o f a fem ale figurine vvith schem atized butterflies incised beneath the breasts vvas found at Passo di C o rv o , a neolithic settlement o f the sixth m illennium b c north o f Foggia, southeast Italy (T in e 19 7 2 : 330). T h e figurine probably belongs to the late ‘ Im presso’ period, M asceria de la Q uercia com plcx. A n oth er em blem o f regeneration o r b irth -g ivin g resembles the letter M . It vvas inciscd ran d o m ly on the back and front o f the torso. T h e phallic top o f the figurine’ s head vvas encirclcd b y a spiral, probably a snake. T h e uplifted face o f the figurine vvas masked and impressed dots around the neck suggcst a bead necklace. T h e accum ulation o f sym bols allovvs one to regard this figurine as a G reat Goddess in her funetion as the Goddess o f Regeneration. T h e shape o f a butterfly em erges 011 C^atal H iiyu k frescoes (M ellaart 19 6 7: Pl. 40) and is incised on European N eo lith ic pots. The butterflies 011 Danubian Linear Pottcry jars even have dots on them, possibly to represent the ‘com m a’-type butterfly. These schematic buttcrflics are the prototypes o f the M inoan ‘double-axes’ vvhich vve find p ortraycd betvveen the horns o f a buli. T h e em blem o f the G reat Goddess in its origin has nothing to do vvith the a x e ; it antedates the appearance o f metal axes by several thousand years. In the second m illcnnium bc; , because o f their incrcasing im portance axes vvere m ade in im itation o fa butterfly (therefore double-bladed). W hen fm ally the buttcrfly becam e a double-axe, the im age o f the goddess as a buttcrfly continued to be engraved on doublc-axcs.

M o reo ve r, on painted M inoan vases there is frequently an anth ropo m orph ic im age o f the goddess having vvings in the shape o f a doubleaxe, an eeho o f the goddess’ epiphany in the shape o fa buttcrfly. T h e T o m b o f the D o u b le-A x cs at Knossos vvas, in fact, a shrine o f the goddess (Evans 1925: 61). The proccss o f transformation from a butterfly to a doublc-axe must have been influenccd by the sim ilarity o f shape betvveen the tvvo or b y the influence o f the n carby IndoEuropeans (M ycenaeans), to vvhom the axc o f the T h u n d er-g od vvas sacred since it vvas inbued vvith his potency. W hcrcas the IndoEuropean axc vvas the vveapon o f a male god, the M inoan d oublcaxe vvas n ever shovvn in such a context. It appears as an em blem held by the goddess in each hand in frescoes and on sehist plaques. C aterpillars appear on Cucuteni vases, both in a proccssion o f the goddess’ animals (see Fig. 12 1) and in association vvith her dogs (see Pl. 164).

caterpillars. Cresccnts vvith dots around them, in association w ith b u ll’s horns vvithin the sections o f crossed lines, such as w e have seen painted on a Cucutcni dish (see Pl. 49), could also be caterpillars. T he m oon crescent, the Caterpillar and bull’s horns are closely connected. Since caterpillars and butterflies appeared in O ld European sym b olism , it is reasonable to assume that there w ere chrysalises too. The chrysalis, if inarticulately presented, can be easily overlooked. Som e horizontally ridged grcenstone pendants from Early Neolithic settlem cnts (such as vvere unearthed in the earliest site o f Anza, M acedon ia, dating from the end o f the seventh m illennium b c ), as vvell as certain form s o f shells used as beads, could be interpreted as representing chrysalises. The shape o fa chrysalis does not necessarily have to appear in lifelike representations. The figurines o f the chthonic goddess o f the C h alcolithic period seem to have the chrysalis as an underlying idea. These figurines are usually schematic and groups o f horizontal lines are inciscd on the narro w in g lovver b o d y (cf. Fig. 103). T he narrovv skirts o f the Vinča ladics, vvhich usually end in horizontal lines or bands (sce Fig. 8), m ay likew ise bc related to the idea o ft h e chrysalis. A 11 odd painting 011 one o f the shrines o f Qatal H u y iik o f the seventh m illennium b c seems to represent a honeycom b with chrysalises, bees or butterflies (M ellaart 1964: 129). E ven to the scientific observer today, the transform ation o f an u gly Caterpillar into a beautiful vvinged creature seems like a miraele. B u t even m ore astonishing is the fact that m an, equipped vvith only the patience to observe, recognized ali the stages o f the dram a and ineorporated it in his sym bolism at least seven or eight thousand years ago.

In M inoan (nsn Indo^luropean) C rete the G reat Goddess is aeen in representations on freseoes, ring* and seals. She is shovvn in associa tion vvith bulls, s r bull-horns, *doublc-axes’ (butterflies), he-goats or lions. O n a stam p from Knossos she appears as a lady o f nature untamed on top o f a mountain flanked by tvvo lions and a male hum an vvorshipper. O n a gold ring from Isopata near Knossos the bu tterfly- o r bee-headed goddess is, as vve have seen, surrounded by vvorshippers in festive garm ents vvearing insect masks (see Fig. 146). She is represented on frescoes accom panied b y vvOrshippers, vvo'men or men in festive garm ents vvith upraised arms. G igan tic dogs portraved 011 sceatite vases or 011 cylinder seals (M atz 19 6 2 ; 1 3 0 ) are probably the com panions o f the same goddess. She or her animals,
part:icularly the bulls, do mina te theritualistie sccnes throughout the
fsdaee period o f M inoan Crete. In G reece, as in India. the G reat Goddess survived she superim« poseđ in đ o slu rep a a n cuIsum! horiion. As the prcdeeessor o f A natolian and G reek H ekatc-A rtcm is (related to Kubaba, Kvbcbe/ Gybele) she lived through the Bronze A ge, then through Classical Greece and even into laser hissory in spite o f tram form asions o f her outer form and the m any difterent names that vvere applied. to her. The im age o f H ekate-Artem is o f Caria, Lvdia and Greece, based on descriptions o f early G reek authors, vase paintings, and finds in actual sanctuaries dcdicatcd to this m ultifunetional goddess, supplem ent and ve rify our understanding o f the appearance and funetions o f the prehistoric goddess. W rittcn sources pour blood into her veins o f stone, clay, bone or gold. In nam e and character she is a non-G reek, a non-Indo-European goddess. T h e nam e o f A rtem is is knovvn from G reek, Lyd ian and Etruscan inscriptions and texts. Its antiquity is dem onstrated b y the appearance o f the vvords A-ti-rni-te and A-li-m i-to, the dative and genetive case o f her name, on Lincar B tablets from Pylos (Bennett 19 5 5 : 208-9). Hckatc (Hekabe) vvas Asiatic, not knovvn to the Greeks in nam e. She vvas Enodia in Thcssaly, perhaps an earlier nam e later replaeed by H ckatc. W hether Artem is and H ekatc appear as tvvo goddesses or as one, they both belong te the m oon cyele. Hekate, gruesom e and Iinked vvith deafh; Artem is, youthful and beautiful, refleeting the purity o f untouched nature and Iinked vvith m otherhood. In C aria (vvestern T u rk ey) Hekate was the prim ary goddess. M ysti*fies and gam es w ere perform ed in her sanesirary at Lagina. In C o lop ho n , dogs vvere sacrificed to her and she herself could turn into a dog. W est o f Lagina vvas Zerynthos, from vvhich H ckatc derived her nam e o f Zcryn th ia. In Sam othrace, there vvas a cave callcd Z cryn th o s associated vvith H ekate. D ogs vvere sacrificed there and mysteries and orgiastic dances werc performed. Hekate and her dogs



are described as jo u rn e y in g o ver the graves o f the dead and above the sacrificed blood . In the days o f Aristophanes and A isch ylos she is the mistress o f the night road vvho leads travellers astray, o f cross w ays, o f fate, and o f the w orld o f the dead, being knovvn by both names, Hekate and Artem is. As Queen o f the Ghosts, Hekate sweeps through the night follovved b y her b ayin g hounds; as Enodia she is the guardian o f crossroads and gates. H er sanctuaries stood at the gate to a hill-fort or at the entrance to a house. Pregnant w om en sacrificed to Enodia to ensure the goddess’ help at birth (W ilam ow itzM oellen do rf, I, 19 5 9 : 6 9 -17 4 ). T h ere is no m ention in A ischylos o f H ek ate-A rtem is assisting at birth. C la y figurines o fth e goddess in a seated position w ere sacrificed to her (id.: 17 1). A terracotta m edallion found in the Athenian A gora portrays a triple-bodied H ekate-Artem is w ith stag and dog flanking her. She holds a torch, w h ip and b o w -a n d -a rro w (T hom pson 1960: 367). Sophocles in A n tigo n e m entions Enodia as Persephone, the ruler o f the dead. T h e torch o f the goddess p ro b a b ly relates to the fertilizing p o w e r o f the m oon since H ekate’s torches w ere carried around the freshly sown fields to prom ote their fertility. Statues o f R o m an Diana show her cro w n ed w ith the crescent and carryin g a raised torch. H ekate is responsible fo r lun acy and, on the positive side, is G iv e r o f V ision.

She appears as A rtem is and under m an y local nam es: D iktynn a, Pasiphae, Europa (‘the w id e -g lan cin g on e’), B ritom artis (‘ the sw eet v irg in ’) in C rete, Laphria in A eto lia, K allisto (‘ the beautiful’) in A rk adia, or A g ro tera (‘ the w ild ’), and D iana in R o m e .

She vvas present e veryw h ere in nature, above ali in hills, forests, meadovvs, and fertile vallcys, and often w as th erioform , app earing as a bear or doe. T h e A rkadian K allisto, her com panion and doub le, was said to have assumed the form o f a bear. T h e stag is her standing attribute in plastic art; she is called ‘staghuntress’ in the H o m eric H ym ns. H er com panion T a y g e te was transform ed into a doe and in the legend o f the A lodac she hcrself assumes that fo rm . Pausanias’ records (8.37.4) that in the tem ple o f D espoina in A rcad ia her statue vvas clothed w ith deer pelt. N ear C o lo p h o n lay a sm all island sacred to A rtem is to w hich it vvas b e -' lieved pregnant does sw am in order to bear their y o u n g (Strabo 14.643, cited b y O tto 19 65: 84).

W e can recognize their ancestors in the m asked and padded m en o f the Vinča culture o f c. 5000 b c (see Pls. 24, 25). O fferings to Artem is inciude phalii and ali species o f animals and fruits, for she w as proteetor o f ali life, bestow ing fertility on humans, animals and fields, and the sacrifice o f any liv in g thing vvas app ropriate to her. A cco rd in g to the legend adapted b y Sophocles, the most beautiful girl o f the year, Iphigeneia, had to be sacrificed to the goddess. T h e possibility o f hum an sacrifice is suggested b y the fact that A rtem is herself is called Iphigeneia in Hermione and Ageira and that hum an sacrifice vvas perform ed fo r Laphria w h o vvas also A rtem is (W ilam ow itz-M oellendorf, ibid.: i8 if.). M utilated beasts, from vvhich ‘a m em ber vvas cut o f f ’, vvere sacrificed to A rtem is in B oeotia, Euboea and Attica. In Asia M inor, in the great spring festival o f C ybele, the shorn genitals o f her priests vvere consecrated to her (Persson 19 42 : 106). H e-goat and stag vvere particularly appreciated sacrificial anim als, and also the hare, a m oon animal. In nearly ali shrines dedicated to Artem is spindle-vvhorls, loom vveights, shuttles and kallatoi have been found and from inscriptions in sanctuaries it is knovvn that vvoollen and linen clothes and threads vvound on spools vvere offered as gifts to her (R o u se 19 0 2: 274, 296). O n C orinthian vases, A rtem is and her priestesses are seen holding a spindle (Jucker 1963 : Pl. 20.j). She appeared at births as the b irth -givin g goddess, A rtem is Eileithyia (‘ C h ild -b earing’). Figurines in a seated position vvere sacrificed to her. D iana also presided o ver childbirth and vvas called ‘O pener o f the W o m b ’ . As the Bear-M other she nursed, reared and proteeted the n e w ly born vvith thepietas materna o f a bear. Tithenidia, the festival o f nurses and nurslings in Sparta, honoured her nam e. T his goddess, as O tto (1965) poetically obscrvcd, m irrors the divine fem ininity o f nature. U nlike the Earth-M other vvho gi ves birth to ali life, sustains it, and in the end receives it back into her bosom , she refleets the v irg in ity o f nature vvith its brilliance and vvildness, vvith its guiltless puricy and its strnngencss.

h o m the pie-agricultufal era as do those o f theGreat Goddess and
B ird Goddess, She đevelops her a w n eha ra eter in the courseoftime. but her intimate relationships to the U pper Palaeolithic Pregnant Goddess is obvious. T h e seed must have been recognized as the cause o f germ ination and grovvth, and the pregnant belly o f a vvoman must have been assimilated to field fertility in the infancy o f agriculture. As a result, there arose an im age o f a pregnant goddess endow ed vvith the prerogative o f being able to influence and distribute fertility. The b elief that vvom an’s fertility or sterility influences farm ing persists alm ost u niversally in European folklore. Barren vvomen are regarded as dangerou s; a pregnant vvoman has m agical influence on grain because like her, the grain ‘becomes pregnant’ ; it germ inates and grovvs. The Pregnant Goddess can be deciphered either by means o f her i]ii4fi ideogram - a dot in a lezenge, or a lozenge vvithin a loaenge ineised or painted on her belly, thighs. neek or arm s, or b y the naturalistic portrayal o f a pregnant fem ale with hands above the belly. She is related to the square, the perennial sy m b el o f earth bound matter. The pregnant figurines o ft h e seventh and sixth millennia b c are nude, vvhile the pregnant ladies o fth e fifth and fourth millennia are exquisitely clothed exeept for the abdom en, vvhich is exposed and on vvhich lies a sacred snake. In this series a high degree o f stylization is o b se rv ed : the abdom inal part o f the body is emphasizcd and the other parts are m odified. Som e figurines take the form o f bottleshaped amulets or rattles, obvioiftly not representations o f the goddcsses, but necessary in m agical procecdings to obtain fecundity.

T he dot, representing seed, and the lozenge, sym bolizing the sown field, appear 011 sculptures o f an enthroned pregnant goddess and are also inciscd or painted on, totally schematized figurines. A lozenge w ith a dot or dash in its centre or in the corners must have been the sym b olic invocation to securc fertilitv. Less abstract are the Early Cucuteni figurines from the western U kraine vvhere the entire body, particularly the abdom en and buttocks, w erc impressed vvith real grain. D u rin g the subsequent Classical Cucutcni phase the idea o f p regnancy was expressed by the inscrtion o f clay balls into the belly o f a fat figurine (Fig. 155). A lozenge is often the most pronounced feature, the rest o f the fem ale b o d y serving only as a background to the ideographic coneept. The idea o f pregnancy as opposed to sterility is expressed by a dot in the centre o f a lozenge or vvithin each o f the paneis o f a Cjuarteređ lozenge. This ideogram , already present on seventhm illennium stamp-seals from f^atal H iiyuk (M ellaart 19 6 7: Pl. 12 1), is encountered throughout O ld Europe both on N eolithic and C h al colithic figurines. A lozenge and dot or a quadripartite lozenge is a very cornmon m otif on schematic Early and Classical Cucuteni (T ripolye) figurines.

The repetition or m ultiplication o f lozenges and their association vvith snakes or spirals was ob vio usly mcant to render the figurines or amulcts more cffectivc.

A series o f Gumelni^a and C ucuteni figurines have on the abdom inal area a m ore complicated design consisting o f interconnected lozenges and triangles usually containing a dot. Since this same com posite design also recurs on round discs w hich are probably am ulets or stamps from G u m eln i;a settlements, this must be an established ideogram . It suggests the sacredness o f sow n fields.

T h e curious connection between the V egetation Goddess and pigs as knovvn from Classical G reek times goes back to the N eo lith ic era. Sculptures o f pigs are knovvn from ali parts o f O ld Europe and date from e ve ry period. In num ber they equal the representations o fd o g s, bulls and he-goats. The fast-grovving body o f a pig w ill have im pressed early agriculturists; its fattening m ust have been com pared to corn grovving and ripening, so that its soft fats apparently čam e to sym bolizc the earth itself, causing the pig to becom e a sacred anim al probably no later than 6000 b c . A n early Vinča Pregnant Vegetation Goddess vvears a p ig ’s m ask, vvhile the sacredness o f the p ig ’s body is indicatcd b y the C ucuteni pig sculptures vvhich have traces o f grain impression on them. Grain vvas impressed on the b o d y o f the pig ju st as it vvas im pressed on the body o f the Vegetation Goddess. These figurines and the p ig masks im ply that the pig vvas a double o f the Pregnant V egetation Goddess and vvas her sacrificial anim al. Beautifu l sculptures o f entire pigs vvere found in the m ound o f N ea M a k ri in ccntral Greece.

T h ere can be no doubt that the p ig played an im portant cult role in East Balkan civilization. In addition to sm aller and larger figurines o f pigs, a p ig’s head from central Bulgaria had 217 perforated ears for ear-rings! Stout vases, h alf anthropom orphicand h a lf zoo m o rp hic to resem ble the hind parts o f a pig, and small containers w ith p ig’s heads or incised stylized motifs o f a p ig’s hindquarters, w ere probably used for sacrifices or for votive offerings.

A true masterpiece o f the fifthfourth cen tury B C is a lam p in the shape o f a pig vvhich was found in the cem etery o f Cam arino in Sicily.

T h ro u g h her association w ith the pig, the beautifully draped D em eter w ith bare breasts, the queen o f corn, the bread-giver and the queen o f the dead (m anifested as her daughter Persephone) can be connected with her predecessor, the prehistoric Vegetation Goddess. Persephone w a sev en called Pherrephata, ‘killer o fsu ck lin g p igs’, by the Athenians (V. G eorgiev 19 3 7 :22f.). Suckling pigsplayeda very prom inent part in the cult o f D em eter and Persephone. T h e festival o f Thesmophoria, vvhich occurred at the autum n sovving o f the new crops in O ctober in h onour o f D em eter, vvas one o f the m ost im portant festivals in G reece. It was perform ed solely by vvomen and lasted for three days. W om en novv brought suckling pigs, vvhich three months before the festival had been throw n into subterranean caves to rot, and placed them on altars o f Thesmophoroi - the name by vvhich D em eter and her double or daughter K o re w ere called during the festival - w ith other g ift s ; they w ere then m ixed vvith the seeds to be used for sow in g (Nilsson 19 5 7 ; 3 12 ; Sim on 1969: 92). Herodotus describcs a similar rite am o n g the E g y p tian s: the inhabitants o f the N ile delta let pigs tram ple on the seeds and press them into the earth (Herodotus 2, 14). T h e same is knovvn from Egyptian paintings o f D yn asty X V III (N e w b e rry 19 28 : Plate 19). T h e im portance o f the pig in N eolithic

and Chalcolithic O ld Europe, particularly the association o f pig and grain, suggests that the Thesmophoria and other sim ilar festivals had their origin in early antiquity. T his does not neccssarily mean, hovvcver, that the E gyp tians brough t this custom to G recce, as H ero d o tu s believed. A t threshing tim e another festival, called Skirophoria, to o k place in A ncient G reece. Y o u n g virgin s vvere clad in vvhite robes and at night given sacred objeets called skira. These objeets vvere figurines o f suckling pigs and cakes m ade in th e shape o fs e r p e n t s . A fter the festival they w ere deposited in th e sanctuary o f D e m e te r . In the goddess’ sanctuary at L ykosu ra, offerings m ade to D e m e te r vvere listed in inscriptions: oil, h on eycom b , barley, figurines, poppy seeds, lamps, incense. A m on g th e terracotta figurines portrayed in th e m arble reliefs found in the sanctuary w e r c female exam ples vvith anim ai heads or anim ai legs ineluding those o f a pig (Nilsson 19 5 7 : 3 1 2fT.). T h e pig as an anim ai cssential in purification rites played a m ajor role in the Elcusinian M ysteries. So im portant vvas it, that vvhen Eleusis vvas perm itted to issue her a u to n o m o u s coinage in 3 5 0 -3 2 7 b c , the pig vvas ehosen as the sig n and sym bol o f her M ysteries (Harrison 19 6 1: 153).



10 The Year-God
The w hole group o f interconnected symbols - phallus (or cylinder, m ushroom and conical cap); ithyphallic anim al-m askcd man, goat~ m an and the bull-m an - represents a male stim ulating principle in nature w ithout whose influence nothing vvould grow and thrive. T his fam ily o fsy m b o ls goes back in its origin to the eariy agricultural era, to the same period when the Goddess o f Vegetation was born and w hen goat- and cow-herdš existed. Charging bulls, buli heads or horns alone, bovine heads with human eyes and ithyphallic men are already knovvn to the Proto-Sesklo and Starčevo cultural com plexes, i.e. no later than the seventh m illennium 0 e. Shrines o f Gatal H u y u k inciude large buli figures in vvall frescoes and sculptured buli heads and horns. A ro u n d the M editerranean the buli and he-goat played a prom inent part in religion from the seventh m illennium onvvards. So did the phallus, recognizable as a high cylindrical neck o f an d rogynou s figurines, as a štand, or the stem o f a cup. T he phallus and bison are know n from the Aurignacian and M agdalenian era o f the U pper Palaeolithic. Isolated representations o f phalli vvere found in the cave o f Laussel, D ord ogn e. A bison-m an p layin g upon a m usical instrum ent in the en graving from La Pasiega, Santander, and another hybridized bison-m an in the same cave (G iedion 19 6 2 : 193) illustrate that the im age o f a half-anim al, halfhum an creature and the connection o f man vvith the vvild buli occurred early. T h e sym b olic context, h o w cvcr, vvas different; the bison-m an o f the U p p e r Palaeolithic vvas not a ycar-g od o f an agri cultural society. Phallic figurines from the Natufian and Pre-Pottery sites in Palestine dem onstrate the persistent im portance o f phallic sym b olism in pre-agricultural and agricultural socicties.

T h e clay phallus from Tsangli, a large Sesklo site in Thessaly, is painted crcam , its naturalism enhaneed bv reddish-brovvn bands and has a broad incision at the top. From iater N eolithic Sesklo comes an enorm ous m arble phallus painted vvith red meanders top and bottom (National M useum , Athens 5936; Zervos, 1963: 398). The Vinča and Lengyel elay or bone phalli vvere decorated vvith bands o f horizontal incisions and vvhite enerusted patterns o f dots sym bolizing snakes. The East Balkan and Cucuteni phalli are usunlly undecorated. D anilo, B u tm ir and Vinča scttlements yielded hundreds o f ‘vvine cups’ with phallus-shaped stems. M any o f them have plain, pointed stems, but others are charm ingly decorated and m asterfully shaped sculptures. M ost interesting are those phalli im itating snakes, indicatcd by incision or in relief. In som e instances tvvo heads o f snakes or o f frogs appear on the top; others have human facial features, such as a protruding nose, vvhile others again are geom etrically decorated vvith striated zigzag bands or triangles.

M an y o f the East B alkan fem ale figurines have a canal through the w h o le length o f the b o d y. Since the canals are about 2 m m . in diam eter it seems that they vvere not made for a practical reason but vvere sim ply imitations o f the phallic canal. Dvvelling areas at Vinča yielded a num ber o f mushroom s carved out o f light green rock crystal vvhich m ay have stood on domestic altars or possibly been used as studs for hip belts. M ushroom s are u niversally knovvn as aphrodisiacs, and the svvelling and grovving o f a m u sh room must have been noticed by the O ld Europeans causing it to be com pared to the phallus. T he fact that m ushroom s vvere carved out o f the best available stone alone speaks for the prom inent role o f the m ushroom in m agic and cult. T h e Indo-Europeans in the days o f the R ig v ed a made their miraculous Som a drink from flyagaric (W asson 19 7 1), and it is possible that the Vinča m ushroom s vvere connected vvith intoxicating drin ks; at ali events they are im itations o f phalli (cf. the m ushroom cap in Pl. 225, right). The shape o f a m ushroom or phallus occurs frequently in sculptural art as a hum an cap on figurines, and a phallic form can be inferred in the beautiful B u tm ir vases vvhich are decorated in running spirals and štand on cylindrical legs vvhich support a globular bovvl. M agical povver vvas ob vio usly attributed to phallic objeets and conferred an appropriate benefit.
T he ithyphallic masked god
T h e ecstatic dancer, goat- or bull-m asked, as seen in the Vinča sculptural repertory, can be interpreted as a representation o f either an archetypal D ionysus or an excited vvorshipper o f the Great Goddess. A m ost rem arkable exam ple is the sculpture from Fafos, in vvhich he appears in hum an shape, p robably to perform at a festival. His anth ropom orph ic portrayals shovv him also in a standing position vvith both hands holding his genitals, or vvith the right arm held across his breast and a red painted phallus in the left hand. M ore often he is seated on a throne, naked and ithyphallic. T his posture recurs in ali phases o f O ld European history, depieted rather clum sily in the P ro to -S esk lo (tvvo enthroned ithyphallic figurines vvere uncarthed at Elateia and are housed in the C haeronea m useum , central G reece: W ein berg 1962) and Starčevo com plexes, but m ore articulately in those o f V inča, Sesklo and D im in i. T h e head, vvlien preserved, usually vvears the mask o f a horned anim ai vvith large human eycs.

The m ale g o d ’s principa! epiphany was in the form o f a buli. The enthroned m ale figurines o f Late Vinca, vvearing an enorm ous mask, have vigorous shoulders vvhich are shaped like a bull’s rum p or horns; quite frequ en d y, too, the entire b ody is that o fa buli. T h e god m ay also be represented as a vessel in the shape o f a buli, but vvith the anim al’s head shovving human characteristics: large wise eyes or ears with perforations for ear-rings or other decorations. The bull’s strength is shovvn to be concentrated in his ru m p ; both buttocks are enorm ous and snakes are incised upon them. Standing firm ly on short legs, he conveys the impression o f m onum entality., This peculiar am algam o f animai and man, typical o f Balkan Chalcolithic art, expressed the Mysterium Fascinans, som ething that cannot be described in terms o f norm al experience. It vvas a m ajor factor in the inspiration and creation o f these extraordinary sculptures. A human head grafted onto a bull’s body reaches a culmination o f povver throu gh sym biosis: the vvisdom and passions o f man m erged vvith the physical strength and potency o f the buli. Such hybrid creatures m ust have been regarded as possessing a greater potential than either a man or a buli alone. Representations o f a buli, he-goat or ram often appear on small ritual vessels. These horned heads em bodying virile forces could have played their part in festivals, or in the vvorship o f both the male and the fem ale d ivin ity. Vessels vvith horned anim al-head protom es vvere enerusted or painted in vvhite, red and black. 236 M an in a seated position vvearing a large m ask.

Allusions to D ionvsus
i pionysus is a prc-Indo-European god o f great antiquity in spite o f his com positc name (dio-nysos, ‘god o f N ysa or N y s a i’ ; the latter p r o b a b l y is a pre-Indo-European place nam e). His cult in G reece is e v id e n c e d by temples, sculptures o f phalli and descriptions o f processions carryin g huge phalli as late as the second century b c , and the persisting tradition o f D ionysiac festivals even into later times is attested by a group o f m ythical im ages h aving strong roots in the local (southeast European-vvestern Anatolian) soil. Discussions about the origin o f the Greek D io n y s u s - vvhcther he čame to G reece from Thrace, Crete or vvestern Asia M inor - are pointless, since ali these lands o rigin ally belonged to the same M oth er C ulture. D ionysus vvas a bull-god , god o f annual renevval, im bued vvith ali the urgency o f nature. B rim m in g vvith virility, he vvas the god m ost favoured by vvomen. The abundance o f phalli in D ionysiac festivals, in sculptures near the temples, on herms used as signposts on the roads and before the doors o f houses suggests that the ancient Greeks vvere no less obsessed by phallic m agic than vvere the O ld Europeans. The b ull-god vvas also alive in m any areas o f Greece and particularly in M acedonia in the tim e o f Euripides vvhose Bacchac abounds in buli epiphanies:
A Horned G od wasfotm d A n d a G o d u/ith serpents crou/ned
(E u rip id e s, Baccliae, 9 9 ; citcd b y H arrison [19 030] 19 6 1: 432).
In the O rp hic m ystcry, the vvorshipper ate the raw flesh o f the buli before he becam e ‘ B acch os’ . T h e ritual o f D ionysus in T h race ineluded ‘ bull-voiced m im es’ w h o bellovved to the god. T h e scholiast on Lycophron’s Alcxandra says that the vvomen vvho w o rshipped D ionysus Laphystios vvore horns themselves, in im itation o f the god, for he vvas im agined to be bull-headed and is so represented in art (ref. in Harrison i b i d 433). Plutarch givcs m ore particulars: ‘M any o f the G reeks represent D ionysus’ im age in the form o f a buli. The vvomen o f Elis in their prayers invoke the god to com e to them vvith his b ull-foot. A nd am ong the A rgives there is a Đ ionysus vvith the title B u ll-b o rn . T h ey sum m on him by their trumpets out o f the vvater, casting lambs into the depths to the D o or-k cep er’ (Plutarch de J s . et Os. X X X V , cited by H arrison ibid. : 433). Dionystts also manifested h im self as the buli Zagreus, in vvhich guise he vvas torn to pieccs by the Titans. The key to a more com plete understanding o f the male god and the B ul! G o d o f Old Europe lies in the D ionysiac festivals - A nthesteria, Lenaia and the Greater Dionysia. In these festivals, vvhich have assimilated elements o f deep antiquity, D ionysus appears as a year
227



god. T h e idea o f renevval is predom inam throughout the festivals of w in ter and sprm g. Each re-enaccs an orgiastic agricultural scenario * w ith phalli, phallus-shaped cups, ladles and cult dishes and the buliman (Dionysus) m arryin g the queen (goddess). The Lenaia festival held in Ja n u a ry v/as preceded by a Rural Dionysia in w hich phalli w ere carried in procession amid general m errym ak in g to p rom ote the fertility o f the autumn-sovvn seed and o f the soil during the vvinter recess. O fferings vvere made before the im age o f D ionysus (including pouring porridge vvith a ladle), and priapic and goat songs vvere sung. T h e purpose o f the Lenaia festival vvas to aro u šeth eslu m b erin g vegetation (Deubner 19 56 ; Jam es 19 6 1: 14 2 -4 3 ). T h e C ity Dionysia festival in M arch vvas also designed to ensure fertility. T o this festival the cities o f the Athenian em pire sent the grossest kind o f fertility em blem , the phallus, as part o f their tribute (W ebster 19 5 9 : 59)- Anthesteria was a Festival o f Flovvers in h on ou r o f D ionysus as the god o f spring, and included drinking and rejo icin g. T h e second day o f the festival vvas called Choes, the Day o f the Cups. T h e vvine vvas taken from the jars and brought to the sanctuary o f D ionysus in the marshes, vvhere it vvas silently distributed in sm all ju g s am o n g ali citizens o ver the age o f four. A fter everyone had drunk, the vvife o f the magistrate vvas m arried to D ionysus in the Bukoleion or O x-stall, attended by vvomen vvho had taken vovvs o f chastity in the service o f Dionysus. Thither the im age o f Dionysus, possibly in bovine form , or an actor vvearing horns and a hide, vvas b ro u gh t on a boat-like strueture on vvheels to com plete the nuptial rites (James 19 6 1: 140). A sanctuary o f D ionysus, vvhich can be traced back to the fifteenth cen tury b c , has been diseovered on the island o fK e o s (Caskey 1964: 326). It yielded m ore than tw enty terracotta figurines portraying vvomen in a dancing posture, dressed in festive attire, vvith exposed breasts, ‘snake collars and belts’. T h e y m ay represent maenads, the devotees and ecstatic dancers in the D ionysiac festivals. T h e sanctuary vvas used fo r m ore than one thousand years, up to the Hellenistic period. Since m any elements o f the year-g od ’s festivals are represented in the sculptural art o f O ld Europe, it seems not unreasonable to assume that festivals took place in N eolithic and C h alcolithic Europe. Possibly the central idea o f ritual dram a, the ‘ Sacred M arriag e’ , the ritual coition o f the m ale god and a fem ale goddess, is refleeted in the 243 little sculpture from Cascioarele. T he statuette belongs to the East Balkan C halcolithic Gum elni(a com plex and is the on ly one o f its kind, but this does not necessarily mcan that there vvere no portrayals o f the ‘ Sacred M arriag e’ in other areas and periods o f O ld Europe.

B o th figurines are o f the same style, siže and colour and vvere p rob ab ly m ade b y the same gifted sculptor. In addition to the pair o f gods, this grave in the C ernavoda cem etery yielded three schematic w h ite m arble figurines o f the G reat Goddess type. A figurine portrayed in alm ost the same posture, but m ade in a Cucutenian style, vvas unearthed in the settlem ent o f Tirpe$ti in northern M oldavia. From the artistic point o f vievv the Tirpe§ti sculpture is not a masterpiece, but again the value o f the sculpture lies in the peculiar tension it con veys through its crouching posture and the erude head (a mask) held betvveen the long arms and inarticulate hands. W e shall conclude this survey vvith the illustration o f a ‘Thinker’ fro m V id ra, vvithin the East Balkan Gum elni{a com plex. H e sits vvith his righ t arm resting on his lap and the left supporting his ehin - a natural position for rum inating. The relationship o f his gesture to that o f the G reat G oddess, as portrayed on the vessel o f Sultana (see Pl. 15 s) and on m any other figurines, suggests he has povvers similar to those o f the G reat Goddess. A conspicuous feature o f the Vidra man is his single eye, vvhich m ay sym bolize m agical and chthonic characteristics. In the Late Cucuteni civilization almost ali knovvn male sculptures are one-eyed.
T he D ivin e C hild
T h e Y e a r-G o d cycle starts vvith the birth o f the D iv in e C h ild . T h e masked goddess in the shape o f a bear, snake or bird nurses the baby (see Pls. 13 2 , 18 9, 1 9 3 - 1 9 5 ; Figs. 26, 96). T h e infant appropriately appears in the shape o f a cub, baby snake, baby bird - ali sym bols o f you n g life in nature. M asked figurines holding and feeding babies, or figurines vvith sacks on the back or vvith a hum p - probably a schem atic representation o f a sack (see Pl. 26) - and their portrayals as parts o f ritual vases, (see Pls. 26, 13 2 , 189, 190) occur frequently enough to attest a ritual rc-enaction o f the m yth o f the birth and nurturing o f the Infant. T h ere is a striking sim ilarity between the O ld European D ivine C h iid and the infant Erichthonios, H yakinthos, and Cretan Zeus in the ancient G reek m yths, vvhich have a prc-G rcek origin. The D ivin e C hild represents the aw akening or a nevv-born špirit o f vegetation. Erichthonios appears as a snake or a h a lf snake, h a lf human. A scene on a Greek amphora shows him em erging from a chest guarded by tvvo snakes by which Athena also stands (British M useum , E .4 18 ); on other vases, G e (Earth) holds out the small
234
Erichthonios to Athena. A ccording to legend Athena hid the child in a chest together vvith snakes and ga ve the chest to the three tnaidens, A glauros ‘ the B righ t one’ , Pandrosos ‘the ali D e w y one’ , and Herse ‘d ew ’ , to guard. The oldest literary testim ony, the C atalogue o f the Ships o f the Iliad, says that the corn-yielding Earth bore him and Athena fostered him. In the Eleusinian M ysteries, the holiest and most ancient cult o f Ancient Greece, the D ivine C hild Ploutos (i.e. Erichthonios) is given to others to rear. Erich thonios’ association vvith the snake recalls the prom inent place the snake occupies in the Eleusinian cult and in the festival o fT h e sm o p h o ria . D u rin g the latter, m ysterious sacred objeets vvere in use, m ade o f w h eat dough in the shape o f snakes and men (Nilsson 1950: 558-63). H yakinthos and Cretan Zeus represent the same god o f young vegetation under different names. H yakinth os’ connection vvith the vegetation cult is further evidenced b y his nam e vvhich denotes a flovver (id. : 558 vvith a ref. to M achteld J. M ellink, Hyakinthos, Diss., 1943). Cretan Zeus, the H o ly B abe born in the C ave o f D ikte, has on ly an Indo-European (Greek) nam e, but is no other than the p re-G reek M in o an -O ld European D ivin e C h ild . A nd it is significant that this child vvas not reared by the m other (Ge, R hea, the Indo-European Earth Goddess), but by Artem is, the Mistress o f Anim als, D em eter or Athena. As a sym b ol o f the perpetuation o f life the D ivin e C h ild vvas at the heart o f the w h ole com plex o fim a g e s o f an agrarian religion, and represents the most traditional o f motifs. The chances are that rites sim ilar to the Eleusinian M ysteries w ere perform ed in O ld Europe. A ritual hym n o f invocation com m em oratin g the birth o f the Infant dating from the second or third century a d vvas found en graved on a stone stele at Palaikastro in eastern C rete. S u rely itš origins m ust lie in O ld European sym bolism , transmitted through the agency o f M inoan culture.

M an y figurines vvere ex-votos and like the vvords o f prayer vvere dedicated to the Great Goddess, the B ird or Snake Goddess, the Vegetation Goddess, or the M ale G o d, a prototype o f Dionysus, the daemon o f vegetation. Fem ale snake, bird, egg, and fish played parts in creation myths and the fem ale goddess vvas the C reative principle. T he Snake G o d dess and B ird Goddess create the vvorld, eharge it vvith en ergy, and nourish the earth and its creatures vvith the life-givin g element conceived as vvater. T h e vvaters o f heaven and earth are under their control. The Great Goddess emerges m iraculously out o f death, out o f the sacrificial buli, and in her body the nevv life begins.

Significantly, almost ali N eolithic goddesses are com posite images vvith an accum ulation o f traits from the pre-agricultural and agricultural eras. The vvater bird, deer, bear, fish, snake, toad, turtle, and the notion o f hybridization o f animai and man, vvere inherited from the Palaeolithic era and continued to serve as avatars o f go d desses and gods. T h ere vvas no such thing as a religion or m ythical im agery n e w ly created b y agriculturists at the beginning o f the food-producing period. In O ld Europe the vvorld o f m yth vvas not polarized into fem ale and m ale as it vvas am o n g the Indo-European and m an y other nom adic and pastoral peoples o f the steppes. Both principles vvere m anifest side by side. T h e m ale d ivinity in the shape o f a yo u n g man o r a m ale anim ai appears to affirm and strengthen the forces o f the Creative and active fem ale. N either is subordinatc to the oth er; by com plem entin g one another, their povver is doubled. T h e central theme in re-enaction o f m yths ob vio usly vvas the celebration o f the birth o f an infant. The baby as the sy m bol o f a nevv life and the hope o f survival is hugged by m asked goddesses, Snake, B ird and B ear. M asked N urses bearing a sack (the ‘hunch -back’ figurines) seem to have played a role as protectresses o f the ehild vvho later m atures and becom es a yo u n g god. T h e male god, the p rim eval D ionysus is saturated vvith a m eaning closely related to that o f the Great Goddess in her aspect ofth e Virgin N ature Goddess and V ege tation Goddess. A li are gods o fn a tu re ’s life c y đ e , concerned vvith the problem o f death and regeneration, and ali vvere vvorshipped as sym bols o f exuberant life. The pantheon refleets a society dom inated by the, m other. The role o f vvoman vvas not subject to that o f a m an, and nnich that vvas

T h e O ld European m ythical im agery and religious practices vvere continued in M inoan C rete. T h e M inoan culture m irrors the same values, the same manual aptitude in artistic endeavour, the same glorification o f the virgin beauty o f life. T h e O ld Europeans had taste and style - w him sical, im aginative and sophisticated; their culture was a worthy parent o f the Minoan civilization.
Som e seholars did in the past classify European prehistory and early history into matriarchal and patriarchal eras respectively. ‘The beginn ing o f the psych ological-m atriarch al ag e ’, says N eum ann, ‘is lost in the haze o f prehistory, but its end at the daw n o fo u r historical era unfolds m agnificen tly before our eyes’ (N eum ann 19 5 5 : 92). It is then replaced b y the patriarchal w o rld vvith its different sym bolism and its different values. T h is m asculine w o rld is that o f the IndoEuropeans, w h ich did n ot develop in O ld Europe but vvas superim posed upon it. T w o entirely different sets o f m ythical im ages met. Sym bols o f the masculine group replaced the images o f O ld Europe. S om e o f the old elements vvere fused together as a subsidiary o f the nevv sym bolic im agery, thus losing their original m eaning. Som e im ages persisted side b y side, creating ehaos in the form er harm ony. T h rough losses and additions new com plexes o f sym bols developed vvhich are best refleeted in G reek m yth olo gy. O ne cannot always disdnguish the traces o f the old since they are transform ed or distorted. A n d yet it is su'rprising h o w long the O ld European m ythical concepts have persisted. The study o f m ythical images provides one o f the best proofs that the O ld European w o rld vvas not the proto-Indo-European vvorld and that there was no direct and unobstructed line o f developm ent to the m odem Europeans. The earliest European civilization vvas savagely destroyeđ b y the patriarchal elem ent and it never recovered, but its legacy lingered in the substratum which nourished further European cultural developments. T he O ld European creations vvere not lost; transform ed, they enorm ously enriched the European psyche.
T h e teaching o f W estern civilization starts with the Greeks and rarely do people ask themselves what forces lay behind these beginnings. B u t European civilization vvas not created in the spacc o f a fevv ccnturies; the roots are deeper - by six thousand years. T h a t is to say,. vestiges o f the myths and artistic concepts o f O ld Europe, vvhich endured from the seventh to the fourth m illennium b c vvere transmitted to the modem W cstcrn world and became part o fits cultural heritage.
