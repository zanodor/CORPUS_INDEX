The Dark Pages of the Middle Ages
written by Gyula Tóth
May 4th 2006
The Hungarian Chronicles and the Fictitious Middle Ages
When Heribert Illig developed his theory known as the Phantom
Time theory he drew his arguments mainly from the history of the
Western part of Europe. He drew attention to the immense amounts of
forged documents that remains from the Carolingian empire, the
Palatine Chapel of Aachen with its architectural features preceding its
own time by several centuries, the extraordinary calendar correction of
pope Gregory XIII and the conspicuous and inexplicable lack of any
archaeological findings, being typical for the era.
Of course he also addressed the oddities of the Byzantine empire: he
mentioned the end of construction, the decline of the knowledge of
writing, the transformation of events of the era in question into (quasi)
fairy-tale and the inexplicable and unmotivated rewriting of chronicles.
His arguments are in themselves heavy enough and worthy of consideration. However, Illig never
addressed one issue, never referred to it with a single word – in fact, it seems he was not even
particularly aware of the problem: the issue of the legacy of the Hungarian chronicle tradition.
Specifically, this Hungarian chronicle tradition, which supports its hypotheses with such elementary
strength, should have enjoyed an elevated position in his book or even a separately devoted
chapter. It is not coincidence that lately our medieval chronicles have become surrounded by a
conspicuous great silence. While in single issues of our renowned historical journals efforts are
being made to “refute” the facts of falsification of our chronology, they do not even dare mention the
issue of our [Hungarian] chronicles.
At first glance, our chronicles seem to be in terrible confusion, regarding the issue of dating the
reconquest1 [of the Carpathian Basin]: Márk Kálti in his Chronicon Pictum2 mentions a date two
three hundred years earlier than that which is derived from officially accepted chronology. Very well,
we might think, we don’t not need to attribute too much significance to the issue, surely he made a
mistake in writing or calculus. Yes, but he is not alone with this problem. Namely, Simon Kézai in his
chronicle3 leaves the Magyar reconquest at the end of the 800’s, however he dates Attila not in the
first half of the 400’s but three centuries later, that is the 700’s! With this both Márk Kálti and Simon
Kézai together make clear that it is not their mathematical knowledge which was lacking but they were in fact trying to remedy the same problem, namely the problem of the illegally inserted three
centuries, albeit using two opposite methods.

Historical amnesia?
According to the current officially accepted chronology, Attila lived in the first half of the 5th century
AD, while the Magyar reconquest took place in the last years of the 9th century AD. The difference
in time between the two events is at least 450 years, which has to indeed be considered to be a
significant chronological difference. Despite this the Hungarian chronicles cover quite extensively
the time of Attila and report the most minute details possible. This same chronicle legacy covers
also the Hungarian reconquest in similar extent and amount of detail. After all this we could expect
with full justification that our chroniclers, having covered the historical eras mentioned, also should
mention the approximately 300 years of the Avar age separating these two events. Faced with this
issue, not only do the chroniclers not mention this – they do not even write down the word “Avar”!
Further, they date the events in such a way that no time is left for any Avar age, for between the
death of Attila and the Hungarian reconquest they claim a distance of five generations and
altogether 104 years! Márk Kálti and Simon Kézai give the impression that regarding the events
between the era of Attila and Árpád they seem to suffer from some kind of historical amnesia! They
skip over 300 years with such nonchalant wastefulness as if these years truly never happened!
Would our chronicles’ memories fail in such a way? How is it possible that they remember the Hun
times more accurately – it being much further away from them in time, than that Avar era which
immediately preceded our reconquest? We must concede: this is very strange! Wherever our
ancestors lived during the 300 years of the Avar period they certainly had to have lived in the vicinity
of the Carpathian Basin. They should have had first hand information on the Avar empire, with its
centre in the Carpathian Basin, assuming of course that there actually existed an Avar empire at all.
Because if it did not exist then it is not such a mystery why our chroniclers are so silent about it.
However, the Hungarian chroniclers do not only fail to mention the Avar empire, they also fail to
mention the Khazar empire. This silence is strange because preceding our reconquest – according
to the official version of history – the Hungarians were part of this very Khazar empire, and – on top
of it all – this, during the time between the era of Attila and Árpád! It certainly seems that they failed
to tell Márk Kálti and Simon Kézai about this fact, since – as with the Avar empire – they do not
mention any form of Khazar empire!
Maybe I do not even have to mention, that the glorious Carolingian empire and its head, Europe’s
father, the driver and motivator of world history, the transformer of the world, the patriarch of two
continents, Charlemagne does not merit mention in our chronicles either. If not for anything else, but
his military campaigns of annihilation of the Avars in the Carpathian Basin, he should have deserved
to be mentioned! Of course to be mentioned certain criteria have to be met, namely, and above all, it helps to be a real, existing, historical person!
The quoted passages are from Chronicon Pictum, pages 21 and 22. Országos Széchenyi Könyvtár
(National Széchenyi Library)
How much time passed between Attila and Árpád?
The old Hungarian chronicles know of a distance of five generations separating the time of Attila
and that of Árpád:
“... and this boy’s ancestry was foretold in a dream, this why he was named Álmos4,
who was the son of Előd, son of Ögyek, son of Ed, son of Csaba, who was the son of
Etele5.” (Chronicon Pictum)
Our chronicles talk about altogether 100 or 104 years between the death of Attila and the second
entry of the Hungarians into the Carpathian Basin:
“677 years after our Lord becoming flesh, 100 years after the death of king Attila, the
Magyars or Huns – thus called in the tongue of the people and in Latin called
Ungarus – in the reign of emperor Constantinus III and pope Zacharias again
entered Pannonia.” (Chronicon Pictum)
The Hungarian chronicles also report such details, according to which Edömén, the brother of Ed
who was the son of Csaba and thus the grandchild of Attila – actually lived to see the Hungarian
reconquest and thus he himself together with his household also returned to Pannonia! How would
all this be possible if between the death of Attila and the Hungarian reconquest there passed not
100 or 104 years but 442 years (!!!), which is claimed by the official chronology?! It is obvious it



2022. 03. 16. 11:48 The Trap of False History

simply would not be possible! Thus the conclusion is likewise obvious: either the Hungarian
chronicles’ claims are false, or our chronology has been forged, as Heribert Illig suggests!
In any case, the argumentation concerning of the 104 years is not only supported by the Chronicon
Pictum but also by the research of the Soviet archaeologists Zakharov and Arendt. But let us see
how László Götz writes about this in his work entitled “Keleten kél a Nap”6:
“The so-called Saltov culture discovered at that time was firmly placed within the
remains of the Lebedian Magyars (that is by the Soviet archaeologists Zakharov and
Arendt). They state that the swords found at Saltov and the Kobán area in northern
Caucasus bear closest resemblance to the Magyar weapons of the reconquest era.
The Saltov culture appeared in the end of the 8th century and disappeared at the end
of the 9th century – so they say. In any case it cannot be a Khazar culture because it
is not to be found in particular in the centre of the Khazar empire. It surrounds in a
massive semicircle the Khazar centre of the lower Volga: from the middle of the river
Don, through the upper part of the river Donets all through the Kubán region all the
way to the eastern Caucasus mountains, to the river Kuma. (...) The Saltov-Majack
culture is the only archaeological culture in southern Russia (Ukraine), on the
territory of which it can be shown that life ceased to exist at the end of the 9th
century, that is, exactly simultaneously with the event of the Hungarian reconquest.”
(This and all following excerpts by the author)
It is important to note that the Saltov-Majack culture, which the Soviet archaeologists connected to
the Lebedian Magyars preceding their reconquest, blossoms approximately 100 years (from the end
of the 8th to the end of the 9th century), before it was – at the end of the 9th century, that is at the
exact same time of the Magyar reconquest – “depopulated with tragical suddenness”! It certainly is
difficult not to recall the death of Attila, the falling apart of his empire and the retreat of his peoples
to “Scythia”, and the 100 – 104 years separating said events and the second entry of the Magyars,
as written in the Chronicon Pictum!
1. This event is also called the Second Entry of the Hungarians into their homeland in the heart of the Carpathian
Basin. The First Entry (the conquest) is considered to be when the Huns conquered this area in the 5th
century. The Second Entry (hence reconquest) is the entry of the Magyars of Árpád in the end of the 9th
century. However, there is serious debate about whether it really was a “conquest”, that is, a military taking-by
force of this territory, since there is solid evidence – archaeological, linguistic and cultural – proving that the
people who lived here at the time even of the “First Conquest” were kin to the Huns. [ ]

“One of the most comprehensive studies examining this complex question [of Magyar-Sumerian connections]
is László Götz’s 5-volume 1100-page research work entitled “Keleten Kél a Nap” (The Sun rises in the East),
for which the author consulted over 500 bibliographical sources from among the most authoritative experts in
the fields of ancient history, archeology, and linguistics. In his wide-ranging study, László Götz examined the
development of the Sumerian civilization, the determining cultural and ethno-linguistic influence of the Near
Eastern Neolithic, Copper and Bronze Age civilizations upon the cultural development of Western Eurasia, and
the linguistic parallels between the Indo-European, Semitic and Sumerian languages indicating that the
Sumerian language had a considerable impact on the development of the Indo-European and Semitic
languages which have numerous words of Sumerian origin. László Götz also examined the fundamental
methodological shortcomings of Indo-European and Finno-Ugrian ethno-linguistic research. His conclusion is
that most Eurasian ethno-linguistic groups are related to one another in varying degrees, and that these
groups, such as the Indo-European, Uralic and Altaic groups, were formed in a complex process of multiple
ethno-linguistic hybridization in which Sumerian-related peoples (Subareans, Hurrians, Kassites, Elamites,
Chaldeans, Medes, Parthians) played a fundamental role.” Source [ ]

The Trap of False History
The Trap of False History
Alexandrian dates in Kézai’s chronicle
We have seen, that Márk Kálti dated the Magyar reconquest to the year 677
after the birth of Christ. However, from his logic we can derive another date
for the reconquest! If we add to 445 AD – which is the date of death of Attila
according to the Chronicon Pictum – the 104 years that according to him
passed between the death of Attila and the second entry into the Carpathian
Basin of the Magyars, the result we get is the year 549 AD. (445 + 104 =
549) Simon Kézai in his chronicle written 1272 dates the reconquest of the
Magyars much later, namely to 872 AD. This begs the question: is there any
connection between these two dates? Well, these two dates are in actual fact
one and the same, only one (549) is to be understood as years passed since the birth of Christ,
while the other (872) is to be understood as years passed since the death of Alexander the Great!
Alexander the Great died in 323 BC and we know that a chronology commenced starting the year of
his death. Hence, if someone living in the Middle Ages was thinking in terms of number of years
passed since the death of Alexander the Great, then he would use dates exactly 323 years greater
than those who already were counting time according to the birth of Christ! To summarise:
445 – Attila dies this year according to Chronicon Pictum.
104 – number of years passing between the death of Attila and the Magyar reconquest according to
Chronicon Pictum.
323 – the number of years differing between the chronology that measures time from the death of
Alexander the Great and the Christian chronology.
872 (445 + 104 + 323) – according to Kézai this is the date of the Magyar reconquest!!!
It is easily conceivable that in the Middle Ages they knowingly or unknowingly confused these two
chronologies running parallel to each other! They still knew the correct number of years but whether
this number was to be counted from the birth of Christ or the death of Alexander the Great had
become unclear. With the spread of Christianity also Christian chronology became commonplace
but in such a way that the old Alexandrian dates remained but were henceforth understood as
Christian dates. Illig also mentions this possibility. In his book on page 4221, in the chapter called
“From Alexander to Alexander” he writes:
“In the dialogue between myself and Gunnar Heinsohn he suggests that the proposed
three centuries of made-up medieval history got into the chronology due to the
Alexandrian dates being read as dates related to Christ. (...) The logic behind this was
that due to reasons of divine grace the references to the the pagan Alexander the Great were no longer accepted and therefore the old dates were simply reinterpreted
as “Christian dates”. (...) In this case the more correct date, namely the the

Alexandrian date according to Byzantine beaurocracy would have been conferred on
the West, which would have then become changed there into a Christian date.”
Illig writes all this without the slightest knowledge of the fact that we Magyars have two medieval
chronicles which, concerning the dating of the reconquest, produce exactly the 323 years of
difference between the chronology counted from the death of Alexander and the one counted from
the birth of Christ. As we have seen the Hungarian chronicles in this respect too marvellously
support the theories of Illig.
However, a question arises: if Kálti proclaims that Attila died in 445 and that the reconquest took
place 104 years later then why does he state the date of 677 instead of 549? Is this not a
contradiction? Well yes, this certainly is a contradiction! However, the cause of this contradiction lies
in the very logic of the calendar forgery. Illig expounded clearly, that the appearance of the fictitious
three hundred years in the timeline does not mean that none of the events falling between the years
614 and 911 are true. Rather, it is much more a case of fleshing out the outer regions of the fictitious
period in question with predated and postdated events, as well as multiples of rulers provided with
regnal (ordinal) numbers. Thus Kálti mentions also the year of 677, because he is not only aware of
when Attila died and how many years after this the Magyars entered the Carpathian Basin, but also
who was at that time the currently reigning Byzantine emperor. In other words Kálti writes 677
instead of 549 because he wants to synchronise his chronicle to the time of the falsified reign of
Constantine III! This was the Constantine III out of which, during the course of time, was fashioned
a Constantine IV, V, VI as well as a VII, too. According to the final official version in the year 677 a
Constantine provided with the regnal number IV happened to be reigning. Therefore Márk Kálti ends
up contradicting himself because he wants to synchronise his data with the false Western
chronicles! Luckily though, he also states correctly the dates from pure Hungarian sources.
We have here then such a Hungarian chronicle legacy, which with such stunning consistency
reproduces the very difference of three centuries in question which Heribert Illig managed to shed
light on based exclusively on Western European sources, and all without being at all aware of this
Hungarian chronicle legacy! We should notice that this constitutes two completely different and from
each other totally independent things which nevertheless match each other perfectly. On the one
hand we have the Western European side of the matter which stands on its own, for Illig has been
supporting his theories with arguments for years based exclusively on Western European sources.
On the other hand is the Hungarian chronicle tradition which is totally independent from the
Western European system of arguments and still completely supports it! Can we, are we allowed to
overlook in its entity such great consistency? In any case, thus says the Word:
“At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word be established.”

The Trap of False History
The Trap of False History
Double standards
Until now the international scientific world has treated as holy writ
such Western chronicles as for example the work of Einhard
about the life of Charlemagne . Despite the obvious
absurdities practically every statement, every half sentence was
taken at face value. This is the very same international scientific
world which ignores in its entirely the medieval Hungarian
chronicle literature and brands it from the viewpoint of historical
science as untrustworthy. On what basis? Why are our historical
scientists using such double standards in this matter? Why is a
medieval Hungarian chronicler more untrustworthy than a Western
counterpart? We know the answer: due to reasons of chronology.
Namely, the official academic argument goes that the medieval
Hungarian chronicle literature, which derives altogether only 104
years between the death of Attila and the Magyar reconquest, is guilty of such obvious stupidity that
it is impossible to take it seriously from a historical-scientific point of view and accept its claims as
trustworthy! Do we understand this? Our Lord Jesus Christ was also sentenced to death because
when asked by Caiaphas he stated the truth about himself! They treat the Hungarian chronicle
tradition the same way: the reason they don’t take its statements seriously and consider it
untrustworthy from a historical-scientific point of view is that it states the truth! Because it
courageously and simply leaves out – skips – the fictitious period which probably was smuggled
retrospectively into history. The possibility that maybe the problem is not with the statements of the
Hungarian chronicles after all, but that the chronology itself is incorrect and that some flaw slipped
into our chronological system has so far not entered our scientists’ minds.
There is yet another aspect to this whole embarrassing situation which clearly sheds light on the
impossible mentality of our historical-scientific academia. However unbelievable, in the middle of
Europe lives a people who, concerning their own history, would rather trust its enemy, the Byzantine
emperor, than its own medieval chroniclers! After all, the larger part of what we know about the
period of the reconquest and the times immediately prior to it we take from the scholarly work
entitled “De Administrando Imperio”1 written by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII2!
Considering that the Magyars declared war on Byzantium and for a time even made it pay tribute to
them, the question arises: can we consider the Byzantine emperor who our ancestors had offended
and insulted so many times to be impartial to the Magyars? Obviously not! But despite this we accept without question every word of Constantine VII, while considering our own medieval
chroniclers to be untrustworthy. Indeed, Constantine VII commits himself fully in this his ominous
work to paint the honour and dignity of our ancestors in as much an unfavourable light as possible.
Let us see:

“And the Hungarians were comprised of seven hordes, but at this time lacked a ruler.
They had neither a native nor foreign leader but there were amongst them certain
tribal leaders and the head of these leaders was the previously mentioned Lebediás...
And the kagan, the ruler of Kazaria gave to the head leader called Lebediás a
prominent Kazar lady as a wife, for the chivalry shown and military help he received
from the Magyars, so that he may father children; but it is a matter of history that
Lebediás never fathered any children by this wife. After some time had passed the
kagan, ruler of Kazaria asked the Hungarians to send to him their head tribal leader,
so Lebediás, when he had arrived and presented himself to the king of Kazaria, asked
him why he had been sent for. And the kagan spoke to him thusly: For the following
reason have you been sent for: since you are of noble ancestry and wise and
chivalrous and the first among the Magyars, it is our wish, that you become the ruler
of your race and that you be subject to our laws and regulations.”
In a word, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus at that time the Hungarians were the loyal
subjects of the Jewish Khazar king, but we did not have enough brains to elect a leader for us
among ourselves. The Khazar king drew our attention to the fact that it was high time we too had a
chieftain. He asked Lebediás to lead his “hordes” and that he be the ruler of “his race”. But since
Lebediás was a humble person, he referred this honouring request to Álmos and his son Árpád.
The initiation rite of Árpád went “according to Kazar customs and practices in such a way, that they
raised him onto their shields. But before Árpád the Magyars never had their own ruler; therefore the
Magyars elect their rulers from this bloodline [clan] until this very day.”
This would then be the genesis of the noble royal house of Árpád, according to Constantine VII
Porphyrogenitus. Naturally, our master forger does not miss the opportunity to emphasise that
before Lebediás the Hungarians did not have a chieftain! He does all this obviously due to the
ulterior motive of forcibly separating the Magyars from Attila the Hun, the Scourge of God, who, in
the 5th century, at the head of his immense armies could force even the Roman empire down on its
knees. In face of this, the Hungarian chronicles know of neither Lebediás nor the Khazar king nor
indeed Khazaria! They do talk, however, of Scythia and call the Magyars alternately Huns or
Scythians, and, where Attila is concerned, talk of him as a Hungarian king. To all this let us also add
the statements of Heribert Illig, according to whom one of the originators of this medieval calendar
forgery is none other than Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, whose statements concerning
Hungarian history the Hungarian historical-scientific community has uncritically accepted. To this I
believe no further comment is necessary.

The Trap of False History
The Trap of False History
Constantine III or Constantine VII?
Illig also reports on the conspicuous similarities between the
Byzantine state of affairs of the 7th and the 10th centuries.
“Around the year 600 AD the advancing Avars weaken the imperial
realm militarily on the Balkan peninsula”, he writes.
Let us not forget: with the correction of the 300 years the time of the
advancement of the Avars coincides with the advancement of the
Magyars. Since Byzantium will need to involve itself in another conflict
with yet another strong northern enemy, this time in the beginning of
the 900’s and the Magyars, there is a strong suspicion that the entire
Avar era is nothing but a chronologically predated duplicate of the
Magyar reconquest. Illig refers to Manfred Zeller, who in his work
about the steppe peoples points out: “the number of these horse
peoples doubles in the 1st millennium, filling up the empty centuries!”
Hence the Avars are simply just a duplicate. They are nothing other
than a nation created from one of the adjectives used to describe the
Hun-Magyars and its only purpose was to fill out the empty centuries.
The rich archaeological finds admired under the Avar name might as well be the legacy of the Huns
of Attila.
But let us return to Byzantium: in 602 a frightening and talentless figure sits on the Byzantine throne
in the person of Phokas, who can only come to power by regicide. Husrau II, the Persian king takes
advantage of the favouring moment and attacks Byzantium, allegedly to avenge the death of the
emperor. Although in 610 Heracleitos topples the terror reign of Phokas, the relentless advance of
the Persians continues: they conquer East Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and via
the shores of North Africa march all the way to Tripoli. The taking of Jerusalem and the capture of
the Holy Cross takes place on May 22, 614 AD, after three weeks of siege. It is interesting to note,
that Heracleitos has a co-ruler, his own son, who is crowned already at two years of age, but who
lives in the shadow of his father for a long time without any real executive powers. When he finally
and belatedly comes to genuine power, suddenly his wasting existence ends. The person in
question is none other than Constantine III. On top of it all, this is the very same Constantine III also
mentioned in the Chronicon Pictum in connection with the dating of the Magyar reconquest:
“... hundred and four years after the death of the Hungarian king Attila, in the time
of emperor Constantinus III and pope Zachary – as it is written in the chronicles of the Romans – the Magyars emerged a second time out of Scythia...”

Very strange it is that the author of the Chronicon Pictum manages to find the Byzantine emperor at
the time of the Magyar reconquest to be an emperor living in the 600’s!
As we know, according to the theory of Illig the fictitious centuries start the year 614, that is, not long
after the capturing of the Holy Cross. Constantine III is already crowned co-ruler, yet he is only three
years old. The time when he comes to genuine power, actually already takes place in the phantom
era. If Illig’s theory is correct, then Constantine III has to appear in some form also in the 10th
century. And lo and behold, the miracle of miracles, in the 10th century we again meet a
Constantine – true, this time not III but VII! Indeed, it is the very Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus
who in all likelihood was one of the creators of the fictitious centuries. After all this, Illig starts to
examine the 10th century life history of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus. The story begins
somewhere at the start of the 10th century, when pope Leo is widowed three times within four years,
before Zoe gives birth to an illegitimate son. After crowning this boy co-ruler the year before, Leo
dies in 912. (It is worthwhile to point out that according to the theory of Illig history starts again in
911, therefore, at the time of the crowning of his illegitimate son in 912, we are again witnessing
genuine history take its course!) This boy rises to real power very late, 24 years after his coronation,
meaning that up until then others were managing the affairs of the realm, which obviously must
have stung in the eyes of the young emperor. In this regard he resembled very much Constantine
III, who also got his hands on the governmental reins rather late, and who also was crowned co
ruler by his daddy, the emperor. At this point who do you think was the illegitimate son of emperor
Leo of the 10th century? Indeed, none other than Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus himself! So there
is a conspicuous similarity between the lives of the Constantine (III) of the 7th century and the
Constantine (VII) of the 10th century. It is interesting to note, that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus
gives the credit for repossessing the Holy Cross from the Persians not coincidentally to Heracleitos,
since by this act he honoured his own (7th century) father, paying homage to his memory. Due to
the fact that Heracleitos, by being the father of Constantine III of the 7th century, was in fact also the
father of Constantine VII of the 10th century! On top of it all, Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus
manages things in such a way, that the genuine history more or less starts again from the time of his
own coronation!
But not only do the persons of the two Constantines show conspicuous similarities, but also the
foreign political affairs of 7th century and 10th century Byzantium. In the 7th century, as I have
already mentioned, the Avar advance from the north was afflicting the empire, while the Persian
conquests in the east were multiplying the worries of “Constantines” of all ages. In the 10th century
it is as if history would repeat itself: from the north the Magyars are disturbing the peace of the empire, while from the southeast the Arab advance is doing the same. This is the point at which a
feeling of apprehension starts to boil up inside: is it not possible, that looking at the Avars of the 7th
century we actually see the 10th century Magyars? And is it not possible, that the advance of the
10th century Arabs in actual fact is identical with the 7th century Persian advance? If the Byzantine
empire in the 7th century had to face the opposition of the Persians and Avars, then these peoples
turn into Magyars and Arabs in the 10th century! In connection with the Arab-Persian problem Illig
writes the following:
“A certain mystery of art history becomes clear, which asks why there are to be found
many more Persian-Syrian than Arab elements in Spain. (...) We no longer have to
wonder how a small number of Arabs from oases could succeed in attacking all
nations of their time from Spain to the Indus river with such favourable results; this
is more to be expected from the Persian armies.”
During the course of their conquests in Egypt the Persians became acquainted with the Quran and
with it also with Islam and thus moving westwards they took them both with them to Spain. At this
point it might not be a waste if we take a little detour and examine in more detail the circumstances
of the birth of Islam, even more so, since during the course of our research we will also get an
answer to the question why it is exactly 297 years that were inserted into our history.

The Trap of False History
The Trap of False History
The flight of Mohammed
In the 4th century after the birth of Christ
biggest challenge for the Christian world church
still in formation were the different heretical
movements. Among these the biggest and thus
the most threatening was the so-called Arian
heresy. Its founder was an Alexandrian priest,
Arius by name, who was born around 256 in
Libya and died 336 in Constantinople. He
started to propagate the teachings of his
heresy, the most important element of which was the denial of Christ’s divinity. In the eyes of the
Christian church this was a serious danger indeed, for the Arian teachings started to spread like
wildfire. The Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Lombards, Vandals and Burgundians had all accepted the Arian
teachings and the many adherents of this movement were to be found also in Antioch and
Alexandria. Swift action was needed to stop this progress as soon as possible. The very reason for
the famous first council of Nicaea was what course of action was to be taken against the Arian
heresy. At this synod convened in 325 AD Arius was denounced as a heretic and severe measures
were taken against the Arian heresy.
We still hear about Arianism in the middle of the 5th century, however the issue was by then in
decline and during the following 2-3 centuries no heretical movement was known that would have
questioned the divinity of Christ. However, in the beginning of the 7th century starts another
important religious movement, namely Islam, which accepts in essence the Jewish and Christian
holy books but denies the divinity of Jesus Christ exactly like the Arians three hundred years earlier.
We know that Islam actually started with the prophet Mohammed’s flight from the Arabian city of
Mekka to Medina. This event is called the Hidjra, which means to flee or run. According to
conventional historiography this took place in 622 AD and this also constitutes the start of Muslim
chronology.
In his recently published book “The Great Calendar Forgery”1 Uwe Topper formulates a most
unusual hypothesis: he claims nothing less than that Islam is in actual fact the direct continuation of
one of the secondary branches of the Arian heresy! Until now no one has drawn a parallel between
these two movements, which is fully understandable considering the rift of three hundred years
between them. But if we examine their main tenets then the correlation becomes obvious indeed.
The correlation becomes even more obvious, if we deduct the 297 years from the date of 622 of the Hidjra – that is, the flight of Mohammed from Mekka to Media – which Heribert Illig considers to be
fictitious. Hence we get back to the year 325, the very year of the first council of Nicaea, which is a
significant realisation indeed!
Sacred Tradition versus The Reign of Quantity



2022. 03. 16. 11:54 The Trap of False History
www.cakravartin.com/archives/the-trap-of-false-history/5 2/4
While studying the Great Illustrated Encyclopaedia of World History in recent weeks, I have
come to an interesting conclusion. The work notes, that the ‘hidjra’ (flight) expression might perhaps
not be appropriate, maybe the words ‘passage’ or ‘departure’ would have been more accurate. For
some strange reason, though, it was still the ‘hidjra’ expression – that is, the concept of flight – that
became conventionally used. So the issue becomes instantly understandable if we place the event
of the Hidjra 297 years earlier, that is, not in 622 but instead in 325! For if it can be proven that the
flight of Mohammed took place in 325, that is, at the time of the council of Nicaea, then it becomes
perfectly clear why he had to resort to fleeing! Namely, it was exactly in 325 at the council of Nicaea
the Arian heresy was banned and it was exactly then that severe measures were enacted against
the movements that denied the divinity of Jesus. Nothing would have motivated the flight as late as
622. In 325 on the other hand, in view of the harsh measures decided upon by the Nicaean Council,
there was all the more reason for it!
But why did the timing of the Hidjra end up exactly 297 years later, that is from 325 to 622? In his
recently published book mentioned earlier Uwe Topper discusses also that lesser known
chronological system which is based on the calendar reform of Caesar the starting year of which is
the year of introduction of the Julian calendar, that is the year 45 BC. This was the Julian (or
Provincial) Aera (or Era) which initially was in use mainly in Spain but later on became widely used
also in western France, North Africa as well as the Mediterranean islands. According to Topper the
Era was that kind of chronological system which suited itself very well to support the power
ambitions of the Church and was introduced at a time when the chronological system based on the
birth date of Christ was not yet widely accepted. Being aware of the existence of the Era system
makes us understand easier why exactly 297 years were inserted into our chronology:
In order to underline its contempt for the heretical movements denying the divinity of Christ even
more; and to prevent if possible its adherents to follow such false teachings, the Church authorised
itself to date the event of the birth of Islam to the year 666, that is, the number identified with the
Antichrist! But let us see according to which chronological system it did all this: well, according to
that chronological system which was widely used in those days by the Church, namely, the Julian
Era! Later though, as we know, they started referring to the years as being from the birth of Christ
and therefore the previously agreed upon dates according to the Julian Era were relabelled into
dates according to the birth of Christ. If we want to convert the dates derived according to the Julian
Era into (correct) dates counted from the birth of Christ it is only possible if appropriately subtracting
44 years, and hence out of the previously agreed Julian Era 666 date for the Hidjra became, with
said subtraction of 44 years, the year 622 AD! Officially accepted historical science dates to this very day the event of the flight of Mohammed to 622 AD. So the reason for adding exactly 297
years to the calendar was to be able to place the Hidjra, that is, the birth of Islam – a movement
grown out of the Arian heresy – on the Julian Era year of 666, the year of the number of the
Antichrist.
However, the Julian (or Spanish) Era makes possible further revelations. Many times one cannot
show an exact difference of 297 years between events and dates on either side of the time rift that,
nevertheless, essentially belong together and the reason for this is that one of either date is given
either according to the Julian Era or Christ. Let me immediately give an example:
The famous Library in Alexandria was the priceless collection of the Ancient World. 700 000 scrolls
were kept there, according to Roman sources. Allegedly, this library was destroyed in 642 AD as a
result of the Arab conquests when Amr ibn el-As, the commander of khalif Omar, conquered Egypt.
At that moment the commander asked the khalif for instructions as to the future fate of the library.
The answer of the khalif was this: If the books contain the same as the Quran they are superfluous,
if not, then they are dangerous. Thus in either case they have to be burned! So these priceless
scrolls were utilised not exactly according for what they were meant: they served as fuel for heating
of the water in the bath houses of the city! All this then happened in 642 AD.
However, we know that the 642 destruction was not the only terrible destruction in the history of the
Alexandrian library. Namely, in 389 this priceless collection was seriously damaged by fanatic
Christians, maybe even Arian Christians. The Pallas Great Lexicon expresses it very
laconically:
“The Serapeion Library fell victim to the Christian impatience in 389.”
Thus, we are presented with two years in which very similar events occurred. These two years are
642 and 389. In both the famous Alexandrian Library is destroyed. Let us examine the connection



2022. 03. 16. 11:54 The Trap of False History
www.cakravartin.com/archives/the-trap-of-false-history/5 3/4
between these two dates. If we interpret this 389 date according to the Julian Era, and then, by
subtracting 44 years, convert it into a date according to Christian chronology, we end up in the year
345. (389 – 44 = 345) The difference between the year 345 and the year 642 is exactly 297 years.
(345 + 297 = 642) It is thus interesting to observe how the fanatical Christians (maybe even Arians)
who destroyed the Alexandrian Library in 389 turn into an Islamic army 297 years later. This shows
clearly how the origins of Islam in actual fact lead back to a certain Christian heretical movement,
namely the Arian heresy.
In the volume titled “The Birth of Europe” from the informational series of books titled “Illustrated
History”, in the chapter about the age of the khalifs I found a very interesting section about the rapid
spreading of Islam:
“Damaskus was played into the hands of the Muslims by its Christian bishop himself.
He sent a message to the besiegers through which gate they could climb at night. The
city gates of Antioch though, opened without a struggle. The patriarch there, Job,
joined the Arab troops and he encouraged the population of other cities under siege,
shouting at the top of his voice over the city walls: ‘It is better if you submit and pay
your levies to our lord, than to be killed or dragged into captivity!’ Even the
patriarch of Alexandria, ‘the pope of Egypt’, Benjamin, greeted ceremoniously the
entering Arab troops at the head of the leaders of the city, instead of encouraging his
followers to defend themselves. The conquerors met tougher resistance only in the
Greek cities of Asia Minor, but there the overrunning of far away lands was also
soon stopped.”2
Let us note: where did the advancing Muslim troops encounter the most feeble resistance? Well,
firstly in Antioch, the gates of which “opened without any struggle”, where even the patriarch there,
Job, encouraged the population of the city to submit. Secondly, in Alexandria, where Benjamin, the
Alexandrian Christian bishop, “the pope of Egypt”, greeted ceremoniously the Muslim army. ... Does
this not remind us of something? Where did Arius, the founder of the Arian heresy, previously have
a prominent position in the Church? In Alexandria, no less! Antioch was likewise the seat of
Arianism.
Let us read the Pallas Great Lexicon:
“The Arians – also called Eusebians named after the lead character Eusebius from
Nikomedia – favoured by the court nevertheless endeavoured to oust the bishops of
the true faith and replace them with Arian partisans. Thus it came to pass, that
Eusthatius, the high priest of Antioch, was deprived of his seat. In a short period of time they removed many bishops from their positions and replaced them with Arian
partisans. Due to this of course uprisings broke out in many parishes, but the Arians
continued undeterred on their initiated course.”
And where did the Arab troops encounter the most fierce resistance? Where were “the overrunning
of far away lands stopped”? In Asia Minor, where the Arian teachings never could take firm root.
What a coincidence! Let us also note, that in said three cities, Damaskus, Antioch and Alexandria,
who was the first to submit to the Muslim hordes? In all three instances the Christian patriarch of the
city! ... Under normal circumstances we would expect that it would be those very Christian
patriarchs who would encourage the citizens of the cities to a resistance to the bitter end against the
adherents of the foreign faith. But no! Indeed it is they who encourage as fast a submission as
possible. How can this be? Well, the answer is very simple: These cities were the seat of Arian
Christianity and these patriarchs were the followers of the Arian teachings. They greeted the
“Muslim” troops as their own awaited fellow Arian brothers in faith. All this lead us to conclude, that
there is no time gap of 297 years between the Arian heresy at the beginning of the 4th century and
the emerging Islam at the beginning of the 7th century and that these two movements have indeed
a lot in common with each other.

The Trap of False History
The Trap of False History
The mighty sultan Miramammona
We have seen, that Uwe Topper came to the controversial
conclusion that Islam had begun several centuries earlier than
previously thought and was present already in the 4th century
BC. But Topper goes even further: according to him the also
Arab conquest of the Iberian peninsula took place much earlier.
On page 138 in his book he writes that instead of in 711 the
Muslims appeared in Hispania probably already in 414. On this
point it might be worth checking what our national chronicles
have to say, since both the Chronicon Pictum and the chronicle
of Simon Kézai reports on a highly interesting event. I quote the Chronicon Pictum:
“Departing from here, [Attila] marched down the Rhône to Catalaunum1, where he
divided his army of which he sent one third under selected captains against the
mighty sultan Miramammona; upon receiving this news he fled the city of Sevilla
from the Huns and traversing the so-called straits of Sevilla escaped to Morocco.”
(page 12)
In one of the editions of the Chronicon Pictum the original text is appended with an explanatory
footnote. At this point the following footnote is made:
“The mentioning of Morocco is a completely nonsensical invention, since at this time the Moors or
Arabs could not have entered Europe.”
Now, according to official chronology this is indeed true. However, if the theory of Uwe Topper
proves to be correct and if the conquest of the Iberian peninsula by the Arabs really took place 297
years earlier, then it is easily conceivable that at the time of Attila the Moorish encampments in
Hispania were already bustling with activity! The falsification of history in the West displaced the
birth of Islam to a date three hundred years later and with it also the Arab conquest of the Spanish
peninsula, while leaving Attila in the 5th century AD. Due to considerations of chronology no serious
historian has thus far been able to state such claims without the risk of being ridiculed, as that Attila
the Hun would have stopped the Moors, although both our medieval chronicles (the Chronicon
Pictum as well as the chronicle of Simon Kézai) make unequivocal references in support for such a
claim. The Arab expansion in Hispania was thus chronologically disconnected from the time of Attila
and the Western chroniclers immediately used this to their advantage. They invented a new fictitious
Western ruler by the name of Charles Martell and wrote that it was he who stopped the advance of
the Arabs, after having procured a great victory over the armies of Abd-el Rahman at the battle of Poitiers in 733. And this Charles Martell is none other than the grandfather of Charlemagne, of
whom it is becoming more and more clear, thanks to Illig’s theory, he really never existed.
Sacred Tradition versus The Reign of Quantity



2022. 03. 16. 12:00 The Trap of False History
www.cakravartin.com/archives/the-trap-of-false-history/6 2/3
With the new conclusions reached by Topper the timeline that was previously turned on its head is
suddenly in one fell swoop corrected and everything falls into place. It becomes clear that our
medieval chronicles are proven reliable in this regard and are not mistaken, when they connect the
checking of the Arabs to the West European military campaigns of Attila. If we subtract 297 years
from the date of 733 of the battle of Poitiers then we really end up back in the beginning of the
400’s, that is, exactly in the era of Attila. Topper also calls to attention – among other things – the
fact that when the date of the birth of Jesus Christ was determined in the Middle Ages an error was
made of 7 years. At first, individual events were adjusted to this incorrectly calculated starting point
and fixed to their dates the corresponding 7 year error. Later however, when this error was
discovered, they corrected the previously determined dates by adding to them 7 years. Since
correction of a number of previously determined dates was unsuccessful, we find corrected and
uncorrected dates mixed with each other within the problematical time period. As an example
Topper mentions the Great Synod of 318, which is at a time distance of exactly 7 years from the
council held in 325:
“... maybe the year 318 is an invention too, in which the Great Synod allegedly
condemned Arius. And how come he had to be excluded twice from the Church? The
two synods are crucially separated by 7 years. Could the first synod be the first one
dated and the second be the same event but corrected from the displaced date of birth
of Christ by the mentioned 7 years?”
If we treat the date of the Charles Martell victory at Poitiers, 733, as one of these uncorrected dates
and if we add to it the 7 years by which the birth year of Jesus Christ was adjusted, then the
resultant date we get is 740. According to official historiography the West European military
campaign of Attila took place two years before his death, that is, in 451. If we treat the claim of the
Chronicon Pictum as reliable, however, according to which Attila died in 445, then the West
European campaign consequently ends up in the year 443. And lo and behold: between the date
(740) of Charles Martell’s victory at Poitiers – corrected by the 7 years – and the date (445) of
Attila’s West European campaign as given by the Chronicon Pictum is a difference of exactly 297
years! So it seems, then, that we need to erase both Charles Martell and his grandchild
Charlemagne from the history books! (Perhaps it is not a coincidence they are both named Charles.
It seems the coins stamped with the “Carolus” name were used also by Charles Martell.)
Shortly after Attila sent one third of his army against sultan Miramammona, Aëtius’ forces attacked
the Huns. This what Kézai writes about it:
“... under the leadership of chosen captains he sent one third of his forces against the sultan of Morocco, Miramammona. Upon hearing this Miramammona fled the city
of Sevilla and by traversing the strait of Sevilla to Morocco escaped the Huns.
Meanwhile however Ethele2 was suddenly attacked by the Roman patrician named
Aëtius together with ten Western kings. And when Ethele hearing this asked them,
via his envoys, for a truce, so that he may join with that large part of his people that
was absent, they did not agree and thus on the field of Belvider the battle between the
two armies raged from morning until night. There was between the two armies a
brook, so very small, that had anyone thrown a piece of hair into it, the quiet flowing
of the water might almost have been stopped; this brook became so large due to the
blood of men and animals from the battle that coaches together with their drivers
and armed men were swept away, and this flood caused many casualties, indeed.
This battle then, that took place between the Huns and the Western king on the
aforementioned location, as told by the ancients, was greater than all the battles of
the world fought in one place and in one day. In this battle the king of the Goths,
Aldarikh falls miserably; when the other kings hear of his death they take flight.
From this day forth the soul of the Huns and king Ethele was exalted, and fear
gripped all the earth, and upon hearing the news several countries served them by
paying taxes.”
According to official historiography the Westerners gave Attila a good thrashing at Catalaunum. It is
very strange, that according to the record it was indeed after the battle that Attila’s soul “was
exalted”, and the fear of the Huns gripped all the earth to such a degree, that “upon hearing the
news several countries served them by paying taxes”! What is actually the case here, then? Who
actually lost the battle of Catalaunum? In any case, László Götz writes the following in his work
“Keleten kél a Nap”3:

One Comment
“The alleged Roman victory at Catalaunum is in all probability a lie. After a lost war
it would have been impossible for Attila to be in Italy – in the heart of the empire – in
the Spring of the following year. But there is independent evidence for this claim: by
analysing the text of the record of the battle it has been shown that Jordanes copied
almost word for word Herodotos’ historical record of another battle, namely the
battle of Salamis.”
1. Here is a slight problem that has to my knowledge not yet been addressed: the location of the battle of
Catalaunum is identified with Châlons-en-Champagne on the northeastern bank of the river Marne, just
southeast of Reims in northern France. Yet according to the Chronicon Pictum, “Attila marches down the
Rhône to Catalaunum.” The river Rhône is in the south of France! Not only is it in the south of France, Attila is
marching down it, meaning he is not even marching northwards, towards the alleged location of the battle.
Being in the south of France makes more sense if he was planning to send an army against the Arabs in
Spain. Just to get an idea, if we measure the distance between one of the most northerly cities on the Rhône,
Lyon and Châlons-en-Champagne it is roughly 450 km. That is quite a distance to march with an army in an
instant! But does not the name Catalaunum remind us of Catalonia in the northeastern edge of Spain? It was
originally spelled Catalaunia. Would it not be more likely that, marching down the river Rhône towards
Catalaunum, Attila was actually heading for Catalonia? Apparently, the historians are not as sure about the true
location of the Catalaunian Fields as they pretend to be. Further research on this problem is needed. [ ]

The Trap of False History
The Trap of False History
No more lies!
When I suggested for the first time that there is exactly 323 years difference between the date of the
reconquest according to Kézai’s chronicle, 872, and that of the Chronicon Pictum, 549, – that is, the
exact time difference separating the Christian chronology and the chronology measured from the
death of Alexander – I found myself facing reactions such as this: “If you take the statements of the
Chronicon Pictum so seriously, then you should also find an answer to explain why Kálti writes such
an absurdity that Attila lived a 124 years!” True! – I thought. It is rather unlikely, that a chieftain of
over a 120 years of age would go into battle at Catalaunum, and would, after this and on top of it all,
also see himself fit to marry!
The other point which is usually brought up against the reliability of the Chronicon Pictum is in
connection with the emperor Honorius. You see, Márk Kálti writes that emperor Honorius was a
Greek, that is, East Roman emperor! Upon hearing this our highly esteemed historian comrades
start to roar with laughter, saying: Emperor Honorius was not East Roman, but West Roman
emperor! And not even Dr. Klaus Weissgerber, who accepts the existence of the fictitious centuries,
fails to note when writing about Kálti’s chronicle: “Honorius was indeed West Roman emperor and
ruled between 395 and 423.” ... Well yes! This certainly is a tremendous cardinal error. How could
Mark Kálti be so mistaken? This is indeed an unforgivable negligence. Kálti even dresses it up:
According to him Attila marries the daughter of this Greek (!) emperor named Honorius and from
this marriage the legendary leader of the Székelys1 Csaba is born. Honorius is then none other than
the maternal grandfather of Csaba, to whom he fled – in Greece (!) – from the civil war that broke
out after the death of Attila. But let us read from the Chronicon Pictum itself:
“So the vanquished Csaba and his brothers – those brothers who being on the other
side at the beginning of the conflict but who joined forces with Csaba – altogether
sixty in number, fled, according to legend, along with fifteen thousand Huns to
Honorius, the grandfather of Csaba. Although Greek emperor Honorius wanted to
install him in Greece, he did not stay there but returned to Scythia, the seat of his
ancestors, in order to remain there. Csaba stayed with Honorius in Greece for
thirteen years and due to the dangerous and difficult journey his return to Scythia
lasted another year. (...) the Székelys thought Csaba had fallen in Greece; that is why
the people have a commonly used saying to this day: “You should return when Csaba
returns from Greece.” Csaba was a legitimate son of Attila by the daughter of Greek
emperor Honorius; his sons were named Edömén and Ed.”2
Following this we can start feeling ashamed immediately: ... this is what we can expect from our uneducated Finn-Ugrian chroniclers. What do we want with our 124 year-old Attila and Kálti, who
thinks the West Roman emperor is a Greek emperor! And this is not all! Honorius actually dies
already in 423! How could Csaba have fled to Honorius after the death of his father, Attila, in 453 (!)
Sacred Tradition versus The Reign of Quantity



2022. 03. 16. 12:02 The Trap of False History
www.cakravartin.com/archives/the-trap-of-false-history/7 2/5
when Honorius, by that time, had been dead for over 30 years?! On top of it all, Kálti writes that the
death of Attila took place during the time of pop Gelasius I, who only became pope in 492!! ... That
does it! ... That is the last straw! ... The person who after all this still believes even one word of the
Hungarian chronicles is undoubtedly an amateurish dilettante chasing an imaginary glory, the
paragon of the spiritual underworld, who, for reasons of base vanity or material gain, is propagating
his distorted theories of ancient history at variance the official version! ... Therefore I now proclaim
from down here to all the idle officials of science up in their ivory towers: it is time to get off your high
horses, because it certainly seems highly probable, that the singular reason for all the absurdities of
our chronicles is the calendar forgery of the Westerners!
Seeing these apparent absurdities of Kálti’s chronicle I was struck by a suspicion according to which
Attila’s West European campaign and unfortunate death really did not take place in the middle of the
5th century, but almost half-a-century before this, in the beginning of the 5th century. More precisely:
in the end of the first decade of the 5th century, that is, exactly during the reign of emperor
Honorius. However, the last episodes of Attila’s life, like for example his West European campaign,
was chronologically displaced to the later date of the middle of the 5th century. The question arises:
how could they do this? How did they push the last period of Attila’s life from the end of the first
decade of the 5th century to the middle of the 5th century? Now, to explain the cause of such half-a
century calendar displacements, the 44 year difference between the Julian Era dates and the
Christian Era dates proves to be the best choice. But can such a surplus in the years of Attila’s reign
be at all supported? Yes they can! We read the following in the Chronicon Pictum:
“Attila ruled for forty-four years, was commander for five years, he lived for a
hundred-and-twenty-four years.”
I have a very strong suspicion that Attila was not king for forty-four years and the only need for this
remark was that the time period of the first half of Attila’s life was still calculated according to the
Christian Era chronology, while the second half was calculated according to the Julian Era. Between
these two systems of chronology is – as we have seen – a difference of precisely 44 years. There
appeared therefore an empty period of 44 years, which Kálti fills with – for want of something better
– “kinging around”!3 This explains also the extremely great age reached by Attila and it was these
44 years that separated Csaba’s journey to Greece from the period of emperor Honorius’ reign.
But what could have been the initial reason for this process?
Why was there a need to create a break of 44 additional years
between the the first and the second half of Attila’s life?
However unbelievable: the issue at stake is Hispania. What was needed was time. Time for what? We find the answer in Uwe
Topper’s book, where, on page 198, he writes:
“Because the goal of the Spanish endeavour of forgery was this:
the creation of a Christian prehistory, in order to justify the
recovery of the Iberian territories.”
In other words, they wanted to create a Christian history in
Hispania predating the Arab conquest of the same, which created the legal basis for the
reconquering of the peninsula and the fight against the Moors. In order to manage this however, the
Visigoths had to be marched into Hispania somehow, preferably before the arrival of the Arabs! But
how can this be achieved if the Visigoths never ever set foot in Hispania? Well, they did not hesitate
for long: no matter if Visigoths never set foot in Hispania, they were simply dragged there!
We have seen earlier, that the time difference of the date – corrected by 7 years – between the
victory of Charles Martell at Poitiers and the Chronicon Pictum date for Attila’s West European
campaign is exactly 297 years. As they created Charles Martell out of Attila, they created the
Visigoths entering Hispania the exact same way. But out of whom were they created? Out of none
other than the Huns of Attila; those Huns who were sent by him to Hispania against the sultan
Miramammona. We know, that these Huns arrived too late for the battle at Catalaunum and out of
fear for Attila they never returned to Pannonia. They remained in Spain and became the population
of that country. Let us read Simon Kézai:
“On the Spanish campaign of the Huns.

The third troop which was sent against Miramammona, could not take part in the
battle due to it being delayed, stayed among the Katalauns and eventually turned
into inhabitants of Katalaunia. For the Huns alone, excluding the others of foreign
nationalities, counted three-hundred-and-thirty-two-thousand and thirty-two. Of
these Huns several in the army were made captains, who are called ‘spán’ in the
tongue of the Huns and after them was later named the whole of Ispania, where they
were previously named Katalauns.”
So we can see, that there is no question of a small military force here. 330 000 Hispanian Hun
immigrants is indeed equivalent of a homeland conquest proper! So here we have this large number
of Huns stranded and settled in Hispania. Somehow Goths need to be made out of these! How? ...
You’d better hold on now. According to official historiography Honorius was not East Roman, but
West Roman emperor, during the reign of whom a usurper of the throne appeared, Constantinus by
name. Thus a civil war erupted between Honorius and Constantinus. Let us follow the
developments according to the Great Illustrated Encyclopaedia of World History:
“But by that time Sarus, a general of Goth
blood, received word that he should strike
down the rebel and bring his head to the feet of
Honorius. (...) But Constantinus was not
afraid; he entrusted the leadership to the
Frankish Edobich and the British Gerontius
and these worked zealously until they forced
Sarus out of Gallia. Constantinus now planned
to take possession of Spain, too. (...)
Constantinus invested his son Constans, who previously had been a monk, with the
rank of high commander and entrusted to him the thousands of Honorians – thus
were some barbarian troops named who were under military command, in honour
of Honorius – and he succeded in traversing [Spain]. (...) The territory fell into the
custody of the Honorians and they hurried to quench their thirst for plunder. They
did not bother guarding the mountain passes so in the Autumn of 409 barbarians
broke into Spain and the territory was overrun.”
Let us note:
We are in 409, when “barbarian” hordes (presumably Goths?!) called HONORIANS (!!!) in honour of
Honorius, break into Hispania and overrun the territory. With the correction of 44 years according to the Julian Era chronology the event corresponds almost precisely (with an altogether difference of 2
years) with the West European campaign of Attila, when the HUNS sent against Miramammona to
Spain are stranded in the territory. And at this stage who cares anymore about such tiny
contradictions as that these Honorians, defying their name, fight on the side of Constantinus
himself, against the emperor Honorius! But – I ask – what if these Honorians did not receive their
name form Honorius at all? What if these are, in actual fact, Huns? Perhaps they are the people of
HUNOR, that is, HUNORIANS!
We have seen earlier, that the victory of Charles Martell over the Arabs in 732-733 in actual fact is
analogous with Attila’s West European campaign and is its repetition, its altered duplication which
the Westerners have made their own. We have seen that if we subtract the 297 years that Illig
considers fictitious, from the date of the battle of Poitiers corrected by seven years, we end up in
443, that is, designated by the Chronicon Pictum to be the year of Attila’s West European campaign.
If we however take the uncorrected date for the battle of Poitiers and subtract, not 297, but 323
years that is appropriate for the correction according to the Alexandrian chronology, then we arrive
in the year 409 after Christ. (732 – 323 = 409) And surprise, surprise: the “Honorians”, named after
Honorius, start pouring into Spain in the Autumn of this very year, 409!
It can be assumed, that the 330 000 Huns that settled in Hispania remembered for a long time that
they were in fact Huns, the descendants of Hunor, the son of Nimrod. Therefore then, somehow, it
had to be explained to them gently and carefully that they remember incorrectly! With devilish
refinement it had to be communicated to them that they are really not Hunor’s descendants at all,
but Goths named “Honorians” after the emperor Honorius! Do we now understand why the Greek
emperor Honorius had to be made into a West Roman emperor? This is why! It would have been
exceedingly difficult to explain why an army fighting in the Pyrenean mountains far away in the West
was named after an East Roman emperor! This is far more believable of a West Roman emperor.

So Honorius was made into a West Roman emperor and the stake was the creation of a Gothic
history in Hispania predating the Arab conquest. The fact, however, that alongside Honorius
appeared an even more Western emperor than he, namely Constantinus, the ruler of Hispania,
Gallia and Britannia, is indicating that it was not entirely possible to completely cover up that
Honorius really ruled in the East!
Sure, but what happens if one day these Huns in Hispania start to examine their history and find out
that the West European campaign of Attila took place the exact same year they themselves crossed
the Pyrenean Mountains and took possession of their current homeland? Then they will no longer
believe they got their name after Honorius! So something needs to be done. For example, the West
European campaign of Attila has to be moved in time, from the year 409 – utilising the Julian Era
dating system – and push it to the middle of the 5th century. This is why we find Attila’s 44 years of
“kinging around”4 in Kálti’s chronicle, this is why Attila’s life span is stretched to become 124 years
and this is why the chronological connection between the flight of Csaba and the period of the reign
of Honorius is broken. And that Attila would have sent an army against the Arabs simply has to be
denied. But an even better idea is to displace in time the birth of Islam by 297 years and to write that
the Arabs expelled by the Huns of Attila were actually checked by Charles Martell.
Thus we see how it is possible to manufacture even three different events out a single one, by
dating them according to different chronological systems. The date of Attila’s West European
campaign according to Christian chronology is 409. But the Julian Era correction already pushes it
to the middle of the 5th century, while if using the Alexandrian dating it ends up in 732. Thus they
become Honorians in 409, Huns in 451 and Charles Martell’s Franks in 732.
Let us observe, in light of the above, how other “absurdities” of our chronicles also receive new
meaning: If Attila’s death really did not take place in the middle of the 5th century, but around 410,
and at this time Csaba flees to his maternal grandfather in Greece, Honorius, then another
statement of the Chronicon Pictum becomes clear:
“Csaba stayed with Honorius in Greece for thirteen years...”
And why did Csaba spent exactly thirteen years in Greece? Don’t we want to guess? ... Because it
is exactly thirteen years later, in 423, that Honorius dies. So Csaba leaves to join his people in
Scythia only after his maternal grandfather Honorius’ death in 423. Right after the death of his
imperial protector. We see the beautiful order in which the until now unintelligible and twisted data
line up themselves. To achieve this there was need to learn the facts about the calendar forgery of
the early Middle Ages.
