I submit that these five hieroglyphs signify wealth resources. All the five hieroglyphs are comparable to cognate hieroglyphs which appear on Indus Script inscriptions as 'standard device' the following coin:
Parts of the 'standard device' which is a hypertext composed of two main parts: top part is a gimlet; the bottom bowl is sã̄ gāḍ, 'a portable furnace] sanghāḍo, śagaḍī = lathe (Gujarati) sā̃gāḍo, sãgaḍa (lathe/portable furnace) సంగడి sangaḍi The numbered parts are interpreted NOT as a filter but a lathe ligatured to a portable furnace: Hence, the parts 1 to 12 are explained: 1. Top hook (handle); 2. gimlet; 3. wavy lines signify turning lathe; 4. slanted

lines signify circular motion of the gimlet; 5. the sharp drill-point of the gimlet; 6. bead or other objects being drilled by lathe-action; 7. smoke emanating from the portable furnace bowl; 8. bottom bow of rhe furnace; 9. Perforations as dotted circles are two signifiers: a. perforated beads; b.strands of fiber or rope. dhāī 'strands or fibers (of rope)' rebus: dhāū, dhāv m.f. ʻ a partic. soft red stone ʼ*CDUA6773); 10. Small circles signifying globules of burning charcoal; 11. stafff or flagpost; 12. base for the two hieroglyph-structure atop the flagpost.

The bottom part of the 'standard device' is: kammatamu 'portable gold furnace' rebus: kammata 'mint,coiner, coinage'. The top portion is kunda1 m. ʻ a turner's lathe ʼ lex.

Te. kundanamu fine gold used in very thin foils in setting precious stones; setting precious stones with fine gold. (DEDR 1725).
Thus, the Indus script hypertext composition of lathe PLUS portable furnace reads: treasure (kunda) of mint (kammata)

śrivatsa symbol [with its hundreds of
stylized variants, depicted on Pl. 29 to 32] occurs in Bogazkoi (Central Anatolia) dated ca. 6th to 14th cent. BCE on inscriptions Pl. 33, Nandipāda-Triratna at: Bhimbetka, Sanchi, Sarnath and Mathura] śrivatsa symbol seems to have evolved from a styli ed glyph showing ‘two fishes’. In the Sanchi stupa, the fish-tails of two fishes are combined to flank the ‘śrivatsa’ glyph. In a Jaina āyāgapaṭa, a fish is ligatured within theśrivatsa glyph composition, emphasizing the association of the ‘fish’ glyph with śrivatsa glyph. meṛh f. ʻ rope tying oxen to each other and to post on threshing floor ʼ (Lahnda)(CDIAL 10317) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' (Santali.Mu.Ho.) The m-sound in these lexemes explains the reason for the choice of taurine symbol to signify 'ma' syllable in Brāhmi script.

It is believed that most of these caves were carved out as residential blocks for Jain monks during the reign of King Kharavela. Udayagiri means "Sunrise Hill" and has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves. The caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri, called lena or leṇa in the inscriptions, were dug out mostly during the reign of Kharavela for the abode of Jaina ascetics. The most important of this group is Ranigumpha in Udayagiri which is a double storeyed monastery."

Svastika PLUS fish-fin (srivatsa) hypertexts of the Tiger cave signify jasta kammaṭa, ''zinc PLUS mint'.which signify the professional competence of Bhūti, the city judge. L.1- नगर अखंदस L.2- स भततन लेणं Translation :- The cave of Bhūti, the city judge (Brahmi inscription)
[quote]Hathigumpha Inscription (Trans lit. in Odia as "Elephant Cave" inscription), from Udayagiri, near Bhubaneswar in Odisha, was inscribed by Kharavela, the then Emperor of Kalinga in India. The Hathigumpha Inscription consists of seventeen lines in a CentralWestern form of Prakrit incised in a deep-cut Brahmi script on the overhanging brow of a natural cavern called Hathigumpha in the southern side of the Udayagiri hill, near Bhubaneswar in Odisha. It faces straight towards the Rock Edicts of Ashoka at Dhauli, situated at a distance of about six miles. It is said to be one of the earliest biographical sketches of a king in India. The inscription is dated 13th year of Kharavela's reign, which has been dated variously by scholars from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. [unquote]
