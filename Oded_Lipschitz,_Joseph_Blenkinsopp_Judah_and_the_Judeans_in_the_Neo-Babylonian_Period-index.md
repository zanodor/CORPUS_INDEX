Introduction
This volume is the outcome of an international conference held at the University of Tel Aviv, Israel, May 29–31, 2001, on Judah and the Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period. The idea for the conference was generated in the course of the fifth Transeuphratène colloquy in Paris, held at the end of March 2000. This ongoing colloquy, one of the truly successful efforts at collaborative scholarship involving (but not confined to) biblical studies, deals with various aspects of the history and culture of the western regions of the Persian Empire, including Judah, more or less corresponding to the Neo-Babylonian empire taken over by Cyrus II in 539 b.c.e. The organizers of the Tel-Aviv conference were convinced that the solution to several of the problems facing the historian of Achaemenid Judah was to be sought in the obscure five or six decades of Babylonian rule preceding the Persian conquest. Of course, this was not new. But the organizers wondered whether some progress might be made if specific issues in need of further investigation could be identified and clarified by bringing together a team of scholars whose widely different specializations would be focused on the issues. No one doubts the importance of the Neo-Babylonian period for Judah. It witnessed the extinction of the Judean state and its institutions, including the religious institutions that had legitimated and sustained the state and the monarchy. Though Judeans had settled outside of Judah before the Neo-Babylonian period, the successive deportations of 597, 586, and 582 b.c.e., and perhaps others unrecorded, set up the contrast between homeland and diaspora as a permanent feature of Jewish life and consciousness. The larger context in which these events took place was the final eclipse of the Assyrian Empire in the last decade of the seventh century b.c.e., the defeat of the Egyptian effort to fill the vacuum, and the emergence of the Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadrezzar. The Babylonian epoch dates formally from the accession of Nabopolassar in 626 b.c.e., but effectively, as far as Judah was concerned, it ran from the Egyptian defeat at Carchemish in 605 b.c.e. to the fall of Babylon in 539 b.c.e.. These, then, are the chronological parameters within which the issues were discussed at the conference.



viii Introduction
One problem immediately in evidence is that imperial policies pursued by Babylonian rulers affecting the western provinces are poorly documented. On this issue, contrasting positions are expressed. David Vanderhooft argues both that the rhetoric of Babylonian royal inscriptions differs significantly from that of their Assyrian predecessors and that the difference corresponds to an equally significant difference in strategies of imperial control; hence the absence of evidence for organizational structures in the western provinces ruled from Babylon. Ronald H. Sack presents the contrary view: the Babylonian Empire simply reproduced Assyrian imperial ideology and organization with a thin Neo-Babylonian veneer. This position, advocated many years ago by Albrecht Alt, won considerable support at the conference. Other aspects of political and military history were discussed. John W. Betlyon points to the Babylonian failure adequately to garrison conquered provinces as a significant weakness, and André Lemaire discusses aspects of Judean-Edomite relations during the last phase of Babylonian control in the light of the Aramaic ostraca from the Edomite region. One feature of Babylonian control of the Cisjordanian region that is not subject to dispute is the establishment of an administrative center at Mizpah (Tel en-Naßbeh) under Gedaliah, a Judean aristocrat supported by a Babylonian garrison. Jeffrey Zorn presents a detailed analysis of the results of the excavation carried out at Tel en-Naßbeh by W. F. Badè between 1926 and 1935. Zorn indicates that this is one of the few sites providing clear architectural evidence for the Neo-Babylonian period and showing, as might be expected, a continuation of local Iron Age traditions. Joseph Blenkinsopp presents a revised version of the old hypothesis of a cult establishment, replacing the gutted Temple of Jerusalem, in association with the administrative center of the province. In this connection, it was practically inevitable that the nearby Bethel sanctuary, which appears to have survived the destruction of both kingdoms, would have had a part to play. Cult location raises the related question of cult personnel, one of the most obscure issues in a very obscure period. The history of priestly families in this period is addressed by Gary N. Knoppers, starting out with an analysis of the priestly genealogies in Chronicles. Conflicts and eventual trade-offs and compromises between priestly families, detectable in the genealogies, constitute one important aspect of inner-Judean polemics during the period in question. The larger question of polemics, included covert polemics, in biblical texts from the sixth century b.c.e. is the subject of YairahAmit’s presentation. Diana Edelman contributes an essay in this direction, in trying to demonstrate the pro-Gibeonite and the anti



Introduction ix
Gibeonite ideologies during the Babylonian and early Persian periods. Another side to biblical polemics, that of commemorative fasting, is dealt with by Yair Hoffman, beginning with the fasts commemorative of the fall of Jerusalem in Zech 7:1–6 and 8:18–19. Without a doubt, the issue that has proved to be most contentious and recalcitrant is that of continuity in the material culture of Judah between the fall of Jerusalem and the fall of Babylon almost half a century later. The debate generally starts out from the position that the murder and mayhem of the Babylonian conquest, and the deportations that followed, left the land virtually depopulated. This view is inscribed in the idea, expressed in the book of Chronicles and Leviticus, that after the fall of Jerusalem the land observed its Sabbaths for seventy years (2 Chr 36:20–21; Lev 26:34–35). The thesis of fairly radical discontinuity that this biblical topos entails is defended by Bustenay Oded, who therefore rejects the arguments of the biblical scholars who regard the biblical idea as expressive of the ideology of the JudeoBabylonian elite in the early Achaemenid period. One of these scholars is Hans M. Barstad, author of a monograph on the “myth of the empty land.” While admitting a significant amount of destruction and disruption, Barstad argues for basic continuity, especially in the Negev, the Benjamin region, the Judean hills and, to some extent, even in Jerusalem. He points out, however, that, in addition to further critical work on the relevant biblical texts, more study needs to be dedicated to changes in settlement patterns and to agricultural and industrial production in Judah during the period in question. Lisbeth S. Fried responds to Barstad, arguing that the biblical text is not saying that the land was empty of people between 586 and 516 (70 years) but that it was empty of its god. Other aspects of this basic issue of continuity-discontinuity were raised throughout the conference. Charles Carter was one of several participants to draw attention to the uncertainties of archaeological interpretation. The absence or paucity of data may be due to several factors, including the bias of the earlier generations of archaeologists who were interested primarily in the “golden age” of the monarchy and who, in their haste to get down to lower levels, inflicted considerable damage. In this region, and in the Near East in general, there has also been a marked preference for monumental architecture and a corresponding neglect of cultural data and the skills necessary to interpret them. In short, the availability of interpretable material depends, to a great extent, on the presuppositions guiding the selection of data and the privileging of certain kinds of evidence.



x Introduction
The conference did not give close attention to individual sites in Judah, the Benjaminite region, and Philistia. This would have required a different kind of conference and would have taken time from discussion of the broader issues that the participants wished to pursue. The interpretation of archaeological data on these sites is nevertheless of prime importance. Although evidence for destruction in the major centers of Jerusalem and Lachish is impressive, the more totalizing claims for the destruction of other urban sites made half a century ago by William Foxwell Albright and, more recently, for the claim of a “Babylonian gap” by Ephraim Stern, need to be evaluated on a oneby-one basis with a view to determining, if possible, which sites were destroyed, when they were destroyed, and by whom. The “rural perspective” presented in the paper of Avraham Faust (not in this volume) reminded us that in Judah and in other agrarian societies such as Attica only a relatively small percentage of the population lived in urban centers. Faust regards surveys as misleading. Thus, on the basis of excavated sites, he argues for significant shifts in settlement patterns in Judah, as opposed to other regions, where continuity was more clearly in evidence. Adam Zertal describes the situation in the hill country of Samaria which, in some respects, presents a contrast with Judah, on the basis of excavations and surveys performed during the last two decades. Estimates of the population of the region following on the Babylonian conquest depend on the availability of data (carrying capacity of a particular site, family size, residential floor space, etc.), which, in this instance, are inadequate or unobtainable. The more realistic biblical figure for the number of people deported between 597 and 582 b.c.e.4,600 according to Jer 52:28–30—would be serviceable only as a percentage of the total population. Nevertheless, Oded Lipschits concludes that the population of Jerusalem, the Shephelah, and the Negev dropped significantly as a result of the Babylonian conquest. In contrast, there was continuity in the population of the northern part of the Judean hills and the Benjamin region during the Babylonian period. The demographic decline in these regions began only during and after the period usually assigned to the “return to Zion,” and from this point of view, according to Lipschits, the “return” left no impact on the demographic picture. The paper of Sara Japhet reminded us that the way that historians periodize the past (from what point, for example, they date the beginning of Israel’s history) is necessarily, if not always, the outcome of a particular understanding, bias, or ideology. Different periodizations

correspond to different ways of constructing the past, privileging some aspects and neglecting others. Sara Japhet concentrates on the end of the Judean monarchy as presented in the books of Kings, Ezra–Nehemiah, Chronicles, and 1 Esdras. A different set of problems is generated by the way archaeologists divide up the past. Fixing the end of Iron II (or Iron III or Iron IIIb) at the fall of Jerusalem is understandable, but it has the effect of focusing on one quantitatively minor part of SyriaPalestine. It also implies a cultural hiatus that may or may not be the case, or may be the case to a greater or lesser extent. It also tends to leave most of the Neo-Babylonian period in a kind of limbo. The Jewish Diaspora was represented by two papers. Ran Zadok presented the latest results of his impressive prosopographical studies based on economic and legal documents from southern Mesopotamia, setting aside the special case of the Murasu archive. Zadok’s focus was on the presence of foreigners in texts from the Neo- and Late Babylonian periods, most of them deeds of slave sales and marriage contracts. Bezalel Porten writes about the Jewish settlement on the island of Elephantine and the settlement of the Arameans at Syene. The former was founded prior to the Persian conquest of Egypt in 525 b.c.e., but how long before this date we do not know. The participants in the Tel Aviv conference did not come together with the idea of providing definitive solutions to these issues, or of reaching a consensus on any of them. They set themselves the more modest task of sorting out some of the more intractable issues for consideration, looking at different approaches and different options and, on that basis, getting a clearer idea of the agenda for the future, the work that still remains to be done. We hope that sharing our deliberations and discussions in print with a larger public may be of use to scholars who work in the period and of interest to any reader with a stake in understanding and retrieving the past. We wish to thank the president of Tel-Aviv University, Prof. Itamar Rabinovich, the former rector of the University, Prof. Nili Cohen, and the dean of the Faculty of Humanities, Prof. Dan Laor, for their generous financial support. Special gratitude is also given to Prof. Yair Hoffman, head of the Chaim Rosenberg School of Jewish Studies, both for his financial support and for his help with building the program and planning all of the various aspects of the conference. We would like to thank Prof. Dina Porat, the head of the Department of Jewish History, for the technical and financial help in organizing the conference, and Prof. Nadav Naaaman for his good advice and great help in the thinking process and planning of the conferences.



xii Introduction
Gideon Shpigel, secretary of the School of Jewish Studies, who celebrated his 65th birthday during the conference, deserves special words of thanks for his hard work in organizing the conference. Last, we would like to thank Jim Eisenbraun, president of Eisenbrauns, for publishing this volume. The magic of taking papers, diskettes, and CDs and turning them into a real book were performed by him and his staff.

The Myth of the Empty Land Revisited

After the “Myth of the Empty Land”:
Major Challenges in the Study of
Neo-Babylonian Judah
Hans M. Barstad
University of Oslo
Background
The idea of an uninhabited and uninhabitable Palestine following the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 b.c.e. was deeply rooted in the mentality of nineteenth-century scholarship, and its after-effects may be felt even today. The notion of a total exile, with the carrying away of the entire population, inevitably also led to the belief that the center of gravity for cultural and spiritual life was moved to Babylonia. Even if the majority of scholars today do not really believe that life in Judah ceased to exist during the “exilic period,” there are still some who do.1 By bringing the aristocracy of Judah into exile, Nebuchadnezzar in fact removed its statehood, which was identical with the royal family and the upper classes. In addition, a number of artisans were probably deported. We know that these were in great demand in Babylon, where the economy was booming, and artisans were needed for Nebuchadnezzar’s many building projects. The Judean state was then replaced with a Neo-Babylonian state. This would have but little effect on national production in Judah, where life fairly soon would have “returned
1. Among recent authors still adhering to the idea of the “myth of the empty land” are Vanderhooft 1999: 104–6 and Stern 2001: 303–11. Apparently, Stern is strongly influenced by his reading of Ezra–Nehemiah (pp. 353 and 581). Most of the other authors referred to below would now accept the idea that “exilic” Judah was not a tabula rasa.
Author’s note: Two friends and colleagues were particularly helpful during the preparation of the final version of this essay. Mervyn E. J. Richardson corrected my English, and Ebbe Egede Knudsen provided valuable information on Neo-Babylonian matters. Furthermore, I am very grateful to Oded Lipschits for inviting me to participate in the conference on Judah and Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian period.

to normal.” The fact that so little can be seen of the Neo-Babylonian administrative presence in Judah should not come as a surprise. The Persians, for instance, were able to maintain their vast empire for more than 200 years, leaving almost no material remains. It is, therefore, impossible really to distinguish between Neo-Babylonian and Persian material remains in Judah. The lack of a distinct Persian material culture has also been noted in other territories under Persian rule.2 It is a mistake to believe that the upper classes had much influence on daily life in a Mediterranean agricultural society like Judah. The overarching political institutions did not themselves contribute to the actual production of food and other goods necessary for the people to have a satisfactory way of life. With nonfunctioning central organs, the stability of the economy and the social order that secured the quality of life would suffer. However, when the local jurisdiction was replaced by an imperial system such as the Neo-Babylonian or the Persian, there would hardly be any fundamental changes in everyday life. Since, as the majority of scholars now assume, “most of the population” remained in Judah, this society must have consisted not only of peasants but also of priests, scribes, tradesmen, artisans, and workmen. In other words, what we are dealing with is a functioning society, with its various socioeconomic institutions still intact. One very important question is whether Neo-Babylonian and Persian Judah had the necessary population or infrastructure to produce the literature that we now find in the Hebrew Bible; it cannot be dealt with here, but I do believe that it did.3 Also, considering the large amount of Jews that continued to live in the Diaspora, it would be meaningless to say that “the exile” came to an end in 538 b.c.e. Even if there was a certain return of wealthy families after 538 it is extremely difficult to evaluate properly the historical information found in Ezra and Nehemiah. The antagonism described in these books between the returnees and those who had remained in Judah indicates, on the other hand, that the land was not empty. In fact, the “exile” never ended. Judeans living in Egypt and in Babylonia continued to live there, developing gradually into the two major Jew

Among the most recent contributions, see, in addition to the book by Carter referred to below, Schaper 2000 and Bedford 2001. 3. Discussing this topic are, for instance, Ben-Zvi 1997: 194–209 and Carter 1999: 286–88. Also of relevance is Barstad 2001: 47–77.

ish centers abroad in ancient times.4 It was only after 200 c.e. that the spiritual center of Judah was moved to the Persian satrapy of Babylon. Our main biblical sources for the events leading up to the exile are 2 Kings 24–25, 2 Chronicles 36, and the book of Jeremiah.5 Akkadian sources tell us of Nebuchadnezzar’s wars in the west.6 Of the final campaign of Nebuchadnezzar into Judah, leading to the fall of the city in 586, we have no records except the biblical. The Bible, however, even if it does contain much historical information, must be used with great care. The logic and truth values of the ancient narrator are different from those of the positivistically disposed Western historicist. Too often, one gets the impression that modern scholars regard the biblical texts as historical documents that have been distorted or corrupted or become unreliable as a result of a long tradition process and that these premodern narrative texts, when treated with a proper dose of “historicalcritical methods,” may be restored to their original reliable status and yield the kind of historical information that scholars are looking for. However, any such approach to the biblical texts fails to do justice to the very nature of these texts.7 It has also been claimed that the Chronicler was more “ideological” and the Deuteronomist more “historical.” These views, however, are likewise based on a misunderstanding of biblical historiography.8 Thus, the description of “the last days of Judah” as it appears in the Chronicler’s story in 2 Chronicles 36 is no more nor less “historical” than the corresponding stories of the same events described in the
4. Unfortunately, there are very few sources for the history of the Israelites in Babylon from the earliest times. One Akkadian source (Weidner 1939: 925–26) mentions the name of Jehoiachin. Here, three different texts refer to “Jehoiachin, king of Judah,” and in a fourth text the king is called “the son of the king of Judah.” Other sources are purely of an onomastic nature. Zadok 1988 deals with both the Egyptian (Elephantine) and the Neo-Babylonian evidence (mostly from the Murashu archives). Furthermore, as Oded has reminded us, it is often forgotten that there were Jewish settlements in several places (and during various epochs!) in Mesopotamia, and not just in Babylon (Oded 2000). See also Oded 1995. 5. An evaluation of the biblical sources is found in Barstad 1996: 25–45. 6. Grayson 2000: 102. 7. Here it may be useful for comparative purposes to take into consideration Mesopotamian historiography as well. Even if this has not been a very active field, recent contributions show that this relatively new area has also become more and more relevant for biblical historiography. A popular survey (with literature) is found in van de Mieroop 1999. For a discussion of the historicity of the Neo-Babylonian Chronicles in particular, see Brinkman 1990: 73–104. 8. Compare Graham, Hoglund, and McKenzie (eds.) 1997.

Deuteronomistic History, or in the book of Jeremiah, for that matter.9 This implies that the amount of “historical facts” that we may take out of these stories, from all three texts, are fairly similar and do not amount to very much more than that Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem and other cities in Judah, that he took a large amount of booty, and that he deported parts of the population of Jerusalem, including the royal family, to Babylonia. Beyond this we cannot really know much about details. We cannot say, for instance, how many deportations took place; nor can we know for certain exactly how many people were deported. As a general principle, we shall have to investigate each case independently before we make up our minds about which details are likely to be “true” in a positivistic fashion.
The Archaeology of Neo-Babylonian Judah
Recent detailed accounts of the archaeology of Neo-Babylonian Judah have been published by Carter and Lipschits.10 The presentation below is based on my monograph from 1996.11 The way I see it, the studies by Carter and Lipschits support the views that I put forward in 1996 concerning the continued existence of Judah during the so-called “exilic” period. Whereas the archaeological evidence from such sites as Jerusalem, Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth-shemesh, Lachish, and Ramat Ra ̇el shows clear evidence of the destructions following Nebuchadnezzar’s campaigns into the west, dwelling-places in the northern part of Judah and Benjamin were not affected. Several cities lying north of Jerusalem, in the Benjamin area, were not destroyed at all. In contrast to sites excavated south of Jerusalem, some of these places even prospered in the late sixth century. Thus, it was mainly the hill country of Judah that suffered destructions under Nebuchadnezzar. The rest of the country was left more or less intact. At Tell el-Fûl, after Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed the fortress, the site apparently continued to be occupied, and the population even seems to have increased. The 1964 campaign confirmed an extensive post-586 occupation, which had been assumed earlier. The excavator
9. On the Chronicler’s particular view on the destruction of Jerusalem, see Japhet 1999: 41–42. 10. Carter (1999: 119–35) discusses Neo-Babylonian sites; Lipschits 1999: 165–80. 11. Barstad 1996: 47–55.



After the “Myth of the Empty Land” 7
even suggested the possibility that refugees from the capital fled to nearby villages such as Tell el-Fûl, in order to wait for better times when they could return to Jerusalem. Among other sites close to Jerusalem that show continued occupation after 586 is also Tell en-Naßbeh, traditionally identified with biblical Mizpah. The later phase of Stratum 1 at Tell en-Naßbeh has been dated to approximately 575–450. What is of particular interest to us, of course, is that the archaeological evidence for occupation at Mizpah in this period supports the Mizpah account found in 2 Kgs 25:22–25 (and in a varied and more extensive version in Jer 40:7–41:18). These stories reflect historical events, and we may assume that the Babylonians established an administrative center at Mizpah. Particular mention should be made here of the studies by Zorn that have contributed considerably to our understanding of Tell en-Naßbeh in the Iron Age.12 According to Zorn, Stratum 2, which probably dates to the late Neo-Babylonian and early Persian periods, covers a larger area and has larger buildings than the previous periods.13 This, again, supports the information found in the Bible that Mizpah became an administrative center after 586.14 Zorn estimates the population in Stratum 2 at 400–500. However, since it is unlikely that peasants and herdsmen lived in the public buildings, one should look into the possibility that people also lived in villages outside the city. Further, at Ein-gedi, one of the sites that was destroyed by the Babylonians, there are also some indications of occupation, or rather of reoccupation, after the destruction of the Stratum V settlement. Also at Gibeon (el-Jîb) new evidence seems to change our picture of the settlement pattern. Whereas Pritchard himself apparently did not believe that the city itself was rebuilt after the Babylonian invasion, it has recently been suggested that the Gibeon tombs, dated to the seventh and sixth centuries, may also have been in use after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 b.c.e. Further evidence in support of continued settlement at Gibeon in the years following the Babylonian invasion into Judah also appears in the form of six inscribed handles from Gibeon. These handles are among the extremely rare epigraphic material that has been dated to the Babylonian period. We should keep in mind, however, that it is

somewhat questionable whether these handles, found in unstratified debris, can be dated as precisely as has been done. The same applies for a similar handle from ha-Moßah, dated by Avigad to the same period on the basis of the Gibeon handles. On the basis of this evidence, Avigad wants to see the village of Mozah, situated approximately 7 km west of Jerusalem, as still another town in the vicinity of Jerusalem that escaped destruction in 586, where life went on as normal (together with Tell en-Naßbeh [Mizpah], Gibeon, Bethel, and Tell el-Fûl [Gibeah]. One particular problem concerns the question of what happened to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. It is not likely that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed all of Jerusalem in 586. To demolish a big fortified city would have been an enormous task in antiquity and also unnecessary. It is more likely that the wooden gates were burned, and breaches made in the walls. Obviously, this would not make the whole of the city uninhabitable, and it would have been possible for some of those who escaped Nebuchadnezzar’s armies and fled into the countryside, to return, at least to some extent, to Jerusalem at a later point. Apparently, the reference to those “who are living in these ruins” in Ezek 33:24 is a reflection of this situation. Evidence in support of this assumption has come from recent excavations in the Ketef Hinnom, a site particularly rich in burial caves. Apparently, some of these caves continued to be in use after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 b.c.e. Thus, for the first time we have evidence in support of a continuation of settlement in Jerusalem itself during the “exilic” period.15 However, not all who had to move as a result of the destructions in Jerusalem (or elsewhere in Judah) could return to their original homes, at least not right away. The question of what happened to these people has now apparently been solved through surveys undertaken by Kallai for the Israel Department of Antiquities from 1967 to 196816 and by Finkelstein and Magen in the 1980s.17 During the surveys a large number of sites with material remains from the sixth century, many of them new, were discovered in Judah. There can be but little doubt that these small towns and villages give us direct access to places where large proportions of the Judeans who survived Nebuchadnezzar’s campaigns were living. The surveys have been discussed

by, among others, Carter, Lipschits, and Milevski.18 Future discussions of these findings will, hopefully, give us a better understanding of what Neo-Babylonian Judah looked like. Moreover, it is important that unpublished archaeological materials (for example, from Mozah and ha-Ramah) are made available. Of relevance to our topic is also the survey of the Judean highlands, directed by Avi Ofer.19 Ofer points to significant changes in the distribution of settlements during the transition period and up to the Persian era. The settlements in the south almost disappeared; those in the central part decreased, whereas, in the northern parts, settlements increased by as much as 65% (!). It is also of importance that these changes continued well into the following period, thus indicating a long-term process rather than a single event.20 This change in the settlement pattern clearly indicates that people from Jerusalem fled to the neighboring areas following the fall of the city in 586 b.c.e.
Judah in the Babylonian Economy
The Neo-Babylonian empire represented a highly developed civilization, with an advanced political and economic structure.21 Nebuchadnezzar’s sovereignty was an empire in the true Mesopotamian tradition. Apparently, it was the genius of Nebuchadnezzar that made it possible to establish Babylonian military hegemony in the Near East for the next half-century. It is quite unlikely that the kings before him would have been able to achieve this.22 Having few natural resources of its own, the Neo-Babylonian empire depended for its existence on the import of materials such as metals, stone, timber, and all sorts of food and luxury items. Already at an early stage the economy of the Mesopotamian countries had turned into an aggressive and expansionist one, soon to be followed by territorial expansion. The conquest of the neighboring countries became necessary in order to secure control of
18. Carter 1999: 172–213 and passim. Lipschits 1999: 180–84. In my view Lipschits’s work is an excellent example of how a more adequate reading of the textual and archaeological sources together may lead to a better understanding of post-586 Judean society.

Frame has pointed out that the fragmented nature of the Babylonian state in the period prior to Nabopolassar did not make it possible to act unitedly or to have a common policy in military and foreign affairs (Frame 1992: 247).

tribute and of vital trade routes. It has been claimed, in fact, that the sole purpose of the enormous military and administrative system in Mesopotamia was to secure a constant flow of goods from the peripheral, conquered territories into the center of the empire.23 It is this kind of imperial structure that constitutes the framework into which we must fit the kingdom of Judah. The long series of campaigns waged in Hattu was apparently also made in order to secure the collection of tribute. It has been pointed out, on several occasions, that Judah functioned as a military buffer zone between Mesopotamia and Egypt. However, military action cannot be separated from economic systems, and it was certainly also for economic reasons that Nebuchadnezzar needed Judah.24 It remains a fact that ancient Israel was always producing more agricultural products than it could use itself. As we learn more about agriculture in Judah, it is possible to evaluate it also from a broader socioeconomic point of view. For the moment, we are only at the beginning of our knowledge of this important area. Far too little attention has been paid to the economic importance of agricultural production in ancient Israel, even though, of course, some important work has been done.25
23. Barstad 1996: 65. 24. Barstad 1996: 64–70. We are slowly learning more about economic conditions in Neo-Babylonian Mesopotamia. Whereas earlier studies concentrated on the archives of the Achaemenid Murashu, a family firm specializing in finance, commerce, and agriculture (Joannès 2000: 1484), there are also now more and more studies on the economy of the Neo-Babylonian empire available. Useful catalogs of texts from the early period are Brinkman and Kennedy 1983: 1–90; Kennedy 1983: 172–244; and Brinkman and Kennedy 1986: 99–106. The Egibi family archives, dating not only from Achaemenid but also from Neo-Babylonian times, contain a wealth of information (see Wunsch 1993; 2000). The Egibi family was not locally based, as was the Murashu at Nippur, but was active all over Babylonia, even internationally, and had close relations even with the royal family (Beaulieu 1989: 90–98). Another important study on Neo-Babylonian economy (including for the first time the archives of the Ebabbar temple of Sippar) is Jursa 1995. Dealing solely with the Ebabbar archives is Bongenaar 1997. The temple archives of Ebabbar provide us, among other things, with the most comprehensive records so far about the oil industry of Mesopotamia (Bongenaar 1997: 261–87). Again, we are reminded that sesame seeds, not olives, provided the raw material for the Mesopotamian oil presses. 25. Barstad 1996: passim. Scholars who have dealt with ancient Near Eastern agriculture, some also with an emphasis on distribution and economy, are Stager 1985: 17288; Hopkins 1985; Borowski 1987; Zaccagnini (ed.) 1989; Dolce and Zaccagnini (eds.) 1989; Liverani 1990; Plas, Becking, and Meijer (eds.) 1993; Pastor 1997; Haring and Maaijer (eds.) 1998; Klengel and Renger (eds.) 1999. A useful perspective from Greek culture is found in Hanson 1998.



After the “Myth of the Empty Land” 11
In light of the above, it would have been unwise of Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Judah.26 Because his imperial system depended on the accumulation of wealth based on production outside his own country, the total destruction of a conquered territory would in fact be an act against his own interest.27 Since Nebuchadnezzar’s empire subsisted on already established forms of wealth production and accumulation, it would rather be in his interest to maintain, or even to increase, the existing modes of production.28 In the present context, I shall mention only two of the famous Judean agricultural products which would have been of the greatest economic value in ancient times: the vine and the olive.29 None of these products could grow in Mesopotamia and consequently would have had to be imported there. The production of olive oil was of immense importance in ancient Israel, as well as in the rest of the Mediterranean in ancient times. In
26. My suggestion that Nebuchadnezzar would need oil and wine from Judah for his own purposes (Barstad 1996: 70–74) is supported by Lipschits 1998: 482; 1999: 184. We note with interest the behavior of Nebuchadnezzar in Phoenicia, described in Langdon 1912: 174–75. Here, we may learn how Nebuchadnezzar, in order to secure the import of cedars into Babylonia, not only constructed a road for transportation but also appointed himself the fierce defender of the inhabitants of Lebanon against their enemies. Even if one has to take away something because of the stereotyped and highly propagandistic language, it follows from this text that the king clearly understood that, unless he made the necessary arrangements, there would be no annual tribute of trees (this text is also in Pritchard 1969: 307). On the cedar biltu, see further Elayi 1988: 14–41. 27. It is difficult to see that the views of Gil Stein and others concerning the earliest Mesopotamian states (if at all correct) should also apply for the first millennium b.c.e. Stein supports a kind of imperial “chaos model” and regards
Mesopotamian states as generally operating sub-optimally, unable to attain or maintain their desired levels of power, authority, legitimacy, and control over the wider society around them. When Mesopotamian states pursued maximizing strategies aimed at extracting large, consistent surpluses from the countryside, these attempts tended to be short-lived, unstable, and vulnerable to collapse from both internal and external stresses. In particular, they often resulted in environmental damage that limited the the very agricultural potential they wished to enchance.
Stein is building on the work of, among others, R. McC. Adams, T. Jacobsen, T. H. Simon, and E. Stone (Stein 1994: 13). On the Neo-Babylonian imperial policy, see Barstad 1996: 61–76 and Vanderhooft 1999: 81–114. For the moment, we know more about organization in the Persian Empire than in the Neo-Babylonian. For various approaches, see Frye 1984: 106–20; Briant 1987: 1–31; Sancisi-Weerdenburg and Kuhrt (eds.) 1990; Vogelsang 1992: 2–11; Briant 1996: 461–87 and passim. Of interest in this connection is also the useful survey of different theories of ancient economies in Snell 1997: 145–58. 28. This is a strong point in Barstad 1996, and I still hold this view. 29. Barstad 1996: 70–74. See also the important, general survey by Frankel 1999.

Mesopotamia proper, barley, beer, and sesame oil were produced, and only toward the west and the north was it possible to grow grapes (for wine) and olive oil. In Judah the olive industry prospered in the late Iron age. Remains of industrial installations have been found at Tell en-Naßbeh, Tell Beit Mirsim, Tel Beth-shemesh, Tel Gezer, Tel Batash, and Tel Miqne. Special mention should be made of the Philistine site Tell Miqne, ancient Ekron, in the Shephelah, where astonishing finds have brought to light 161 large Iron Age IIB/C installations, capable of mass producing at least an average of 1000 tons of olive oil a year.30 When we know that the annual yield of oil at Tell Miqne was one-fifth of the national export of olive oil from Israel today, we can appreciate the enormous economic significance of wine and olive oil production in ancient Palestine and in the Mediterranean countries. More important, the enormous quantities of olives necessary to keep up the production at Philistine Ekron most likely came from the hill country!31 When Ekron was destroyed, probably during Nebuchadnezzar’s campaign to Philistia in 603 b.c.e.,32 olive presses elsewhere had to take over the production of the valuable oil. Tell en-Naßbeh, biblical Mizpah, was one of the places where olive oil was produced. As we have seen above, this was one of the sites where Judean settlements not only continued but even flourished during the Neo-Babylonian period. It will be the task of archaeology in the future to look for other olive installations that were prospering during the Neo-Babylonian period. Wine production was also of great importance. The several hundred references to the vine and to wine throughout the Hebrew Bible clearly reflect their significance for ancient Israelite life and society. Again, there is a tendency among some biblical scholars to ignore the massive economic implications of the agricultural surplus. Here, particular mention should be made of the impressive installations for wine production discovered at Gibeon, another site where there was continued settlement after 586. It is in light of this fact that the information in 2 Kgs 25:12, that Nebuzaradan left vinedressers (μymrk) and ploughmen (μybgy) to work in the vineyards and on the soil, becomes especially meaningful. The economic importance of Gibeon can hardly be exaggerated. Because Palestine always produced more wine than could be consumed

locally,33 wine must have been a major export item and, together with olive oil, would have been of considerable economic interest to the biltu-hungry Neo-Babylonian population. In the sixth century b.c.e., Babylon was prospering, and there was no shortage of food from the countryside to feed the large urban population.34 Wine and olive oil, on the other hand, were much-sought-after luxury goods, available only to the very rich.35 Yet we cannot know for certain whether wine and oil were actually brought to Mesopotamia from Judah. Not much has been published on Neo-Babylonian long-distance trade.36 The agricultural products were used to feed the Babylonian army and to uphold the local administration, and any surplus would probably have been sold for profit in the normal distribution channels, temporarily ending up at one of the great merchant centers such as inland Damascus or seaside Tyre.37
33. The storage capacity of the already-discovered 63 wine cellars has been estimated at approximately 95,000 liters! The most recent survey of wine production at Gibeon is found in Walsh 2000: 158–62. Not everyone agrees that the cellars were used for wine. Since there is no residue, there is no way of knowing for certain what kind of agricultural products were stored at Gibeon. This, however, is not so important. The main thing is that we are dealing with some sort of cash crop agriculture. 34. Van de Mieroop 1997: 206. 35. One example may illustrate the price of wine in late Neo-Babylonian times. Nabonidus boasts that wine, which used to be so rare, abounds in his time and that 18 liters sold for (as little as) one shekel of silver. This translates into a price of U.S. $33.33, 1991 vintage, per liter (Powell 2000: 101). 36. This is why surveys on the topic leave out the Neo-Babylonian period. See, for instance, Yoffee 2000: 1387–99 and Astour 2000: 1401–20. There are some references in Barstad 1996: 71 n. 27. See also van de Mieroop 1997: 196. 37. In the so-called Wadi Brisa inscriptions, written to commemorate the conquest of Lebanon and the victory over Pharaoh Neco in 586 b.c.e., Nebuchadnezzar refers to several different places from which wine was imported to Babylon (Langdon 1912: 15455). Zehnpfund’s translation refers to the following names: Izallu, Tuimmu, Siminu, Hilbunu, Arnabanu, Suhu, Bit-kubati, Opis, and Bitati. It is commonly thought that most of these places are in the north and in Syria. Obviously, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to identify these locations with any certainty. Since wine was not produced in Mesopotamia, it had to be imported. Opis/upe (on this city, see Grayson 2000: 261 and 294) on the Tigris was one of the merchant centers of the time, from which wine was brought to the capital. It was not necessary for a commercial center to produce its own commodities. For instance, we know that large quantities of iron were paid in tribute to Assyria by Damascus in the first millennium. Since iron was not produced in the Damascus area, Damascus must have been a center for iron trade, rather than iron production (Saggs 1988: 242). Hilbunu is often associated with Halbun near Damascus in modern Syria. Wine from Helbon (Hilbunu) is also mentioned in Ezek 27:18, and so is wine from Izalla (in Ezek 27: 19). That the Masoretic Text should be corrected here is convincingly demonstrated by

Conclusions
Scholars have hardly shown any interest in the history and culture of the large majority of the population that actually remained in Judah after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 b.c.e. The sharp distinction made between “before and after 586” has overshadowed the fact that we are dealing with a continuous culture. Obviously, we should not belittle the several deportations. What we must renounce, however, is the claim that these deportations affected life in Palestine the way earlier generations of scholars believed. The Judah left behind by the Babylonians was not a desolate and empty country lying in ruins until the Jews miraculously arrived back under Cyrus. After the fall of Jerusalem, Judah made up another cog in the great economic wheels of the Neo-Babylonian empire, and life went on after 586 pretty much in the same way that it did before the arrival of Nebuchadnezzar’s armies. Archaeological excavations support the continued existence of a considerable Israelite material culture in the Negev beyond doubt, particularly in the area of Benjamin, but also in the the Judean Hills, and probably even in Jerusalem. One major challenge that we are facing now is to compare the most recent archaeological studies on changes in settlement patterns during the exilic period (Barkay, Ofer, Zorn, Lipschits, and others), in order to try to create a broader picture. Another important task would be to look into the agricultural and industrial production of the period in order to understand better the macroeconomics of Judah within the larger system of the Neo-Babylonian empire. A third challenge concerns the evaluation of the biblical sources. The historiographical sources of the Hebrew Bible are narrative and premodern, yet they do contain valuable historical information. In the future, we shall have to deal more critically with the question of how the texts of Jeremiah, the Deuteronomist, the Chronicler, and Ezra and Nehemiah can be used for historical reconstructions.

The Land Lay Desolate:
Conquest and Restoration in
the Ancient Near East
Lisbeth S. Fried
University of Michigan
C. C. Torrey (1970: 285–314) provides a general theory of the course of events in Jerusalem from the date of the Temple’s destruction by Nebuchadnezzar until its restoration under Darius I: shortly after the Babylonian armies withdrew from Judah, fugitives began to return and to bring life back to the ruined city. One of the first undertakings was a temporary house for the worship of Yhwh on some part of the original site. Jerusalem grew by slow degrees, and by the beginning of the Persian period, fifty years after its destruction, the city had prospered. During the time of Darius I, the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and perhaps others chastised the people and encouraged them to build a permanent structure worthy of the deity. The work began in the second year of Darius, and was completed sometime thereafter. According to Torrey, there was a modest deportation of citizens from Jerusalem to Babylon, but there was no period in which Jerusalem or Judah remained uninhabited. Life went on as normal. Cyrus’s conquest did not bring about a return of the exiles, who had settled down and become part of the citizenry of Babylon. There is no dividing line between the pre- and postexilic periods; it is all one. There was no gap. Barstad (1996) takes up Torrey’s cudgel. True, the Temple was destroyed; true, there were deportations, but in the main, life went on normally. More specifically, Barstad takes issue with the widespread belief perpetrated by the Chronicler and by the author of EzraNehemiah that the impetus for rebuilding the Temple came not from the local population left in the land but from the putative returnees. To

Barstad, the society left in the land comprised agricultural workers but also artisans, traders, village and town elders, scribes, priests, and prophets. It was a functioning society with many of its political institutions still intact (Barstad 1996: 19, 42–43, 79). The destruction of the Temple, the removal of the high priests and the royal family and so on did not change the infrastructure that made society possible. The people even worshiped as they did before. Both Torrey and Barstad take issue with the claim that economic, cultural, and religious activity came to a standstill during Babylonian occupation. However, the notion that life went on as before, unchanged, greatly underestimates the role of both temple and palace—the primary institutions in ancient society. Postgate (1992:109) writes:
We cannot any longer maintain that because the temple collected commodities and distributed them to its dependants the entire economy operated through ‘redistribution’, or that the priests controlled all agricultural production and commercial activity. Nevertheless, we must not overcompensate, and so underrate the importance of the temple’s role. In a sense it represents the communal identity of each city: it symbolizes it, but it also concentrates wealth and offers services to the community which are . . . critical to the growth of an urban civilization.
Postgate describes the role of the great Bronze Age temples in Mesopotamia, but the temple was no less a factor during the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods (Fried 2000). Besides its crucial economic role in ancient societies, the temple’s psychological impact was even greater. A letter (TAD A4.7) from a group of Egyptian Jews writing during the Persian period describes their feelings after their temple was destroyed (Porten and Yardeni 1986: 68–71). Their loss was enormous, even though the destruction of that Elephantine temple involved neither deaths nor deportations:
from the month of Tammuz, year 14 of King Darius [when the temple was destroyed] and until this day [the 20th of Mar ̇esvan, year 17 of King Darius] we are wearing sackcloth and fasting; our wives are made as widow(s); (we) do not anoint (ourselves) with oil and do not drink wine. Moreover, from that (time) and until this day they did not make meal-offering and incense and holocaust in that Temple.
After the destruction of the Elephantine temple, life did not continue as before; normal life was aborted. The impetus to rebuild was immediate, and it stemmed from the residents themselves. This seems the appropriate and typical reaction. If this was so, why was the pressure to build the Jerusalem Temple delayed until the time of Cyrus or



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 23
Darius? Was it a matter of prosperity becoming great enough, as Torrey suggests? Was it begun only at the exhortations of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah? If so, why was their urging necessary? What accounts for the difference in response between the Jerusalem and Elephantine communities? The answer may lie in the circumstances of the destruction of the two temples. One was destroyed perhaps through ethnic rivalries (Fried 2000; forthcoming); the other in a military conquest. Ideological requirements for rebuilding may exist after a military defeat that do not exist normally. If so, would the population in Judah have been able to meet those requirements, or would returnees from Babylon have been necessary? To answer these questions I examine first the ideology of temple destruction as a result of military conquest and then the ideology of reconstruction after conquest.
The Ideology of Conquest in the Ancient Near East
As is well known, history writing (then as now) is not simply a chronicle of facts but the past encoded in a narrative framework (van de Mieroop 1999; Younger 1990). This framework is determined by the world view of the narrator. To read ancient historiography is to make contact not only with the events that the narrator selects but with his ideology. Younger (1990: 51) defines ideology as
a schematic image of social order, a pattern of beliefs and concepts (both factual and normative) which purport to explain complex social phenomena.
Younger has shown that Assyrian conquest accounts exhibit a fixed literary structure that illustrates not only the Assyrians’ ideology of history writing but also their ideology of conquest. Conquest accounts are found to be composed of “precise and easily recognizable structural elements [that] were used along preconceived lines and slants” (1990: 70). The sequential order may be altered, but the same elements occur. The formal structure is the trellis on which a particular account is hung. Younger (1990: 72–79) has isolated the following components
A. Spatio-Temporal Coordinates. The narrative is situated in space and time. B. Disorder. The state of disorder which induces the Assyrian king to act. This is typically rebellion. C. Divine Aid. D. Gathering of the Troops.
E. Move from Place to Place. This is the movement to the scene of the battle.

F. The Terrifying Presence. This is either the presence of the god Assur or the king himself. G. The Siege of the Enemy City. This is usually at night. H. Flight. The enemy flees from the presence of the god or king. This can also be non-flight, in which there is a battle. I. Pursuit. If H = non-flight, then this episode is missing. J. Combat. This may be represented by the enemy king simply submitting. K. Outcome of Combat. This is either destruction of the enemy or the acquisition of booty in terms of prisoners and goods, or both. L. Submission. The personal submission of the enemy king. M. Exemplary Punishment.
N. Consequences. The establishment of a new relationship between the king and the enemy. O. Acts of Celebration. P. Return. Q. Summary Statement.
Younger has shown that this literary structure underlies Assyrian and Hittite conquest accounts (1990: 79–163). This series of fixed, stereotyped components comprises the text’s transmission code, the text’s grammar. It expresses the social ideology, the set of expectations that define what a conquest is.
The Ideology of the Conquest of Jerusalem (2 Kings 24, 25)
The biblical account of the conquests of Jerusalem and Judah during the reigns of Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah by Nebuchadnezzar perfectly fits Younger’s syntagmatic analysis of Assyrian conquest accounts. It must be remembered that, contrary to Assyrian narratives, this account is from the point of view of the vanquished.

Jehoiakim evidently died of natural causes during the attack, so he did not surrender. As a result, the chronicle is unnaturally aborted. It begins again with his son, Jehoiachin. The grammar of conquest evidently does not permit kings to be changed in the middle of battle. The report therefore begins again at the top. b.

From the city he took the official appointed over the men of war, and five men who see the face of the king who were found in the city, and the army scribe in charge of the muster of the people of the land, as well as 60 men of the people of the land found in the city.

Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 29
This analysis reveals a conquest account identical to conquest accounts throughout the ancient Near East. The historiography employed by the writer is the historiography of the royal Assyrian scribe. The trellis used to hang the historical episodes is the same. This stereotypical language suggests that the Judeans shared with the rest of the ancient Near East not only a common ideology of conquest but also a common ideology of history and history-writing.
The Role of the Conquered God
Component C above is Divine Aid. The divine aid listed in the conquest of Jerusalem is provided by Yhwh himself. In addition to the items that Younger lists, scholars note that the complicity of the god whose temple was destroyed is also common in Assyrian conquest accounts (Albrektson 1967: esp. chaps. 1, 2, and 6; Cogan 1974: 10–21; Holloway 1992: 342–49; Kutsko 2000: 101–23, 157–69). As in 2 Kings, the displeasure of the local god with his people causes him to abandon the city and to invite in the conquering army. Sometimes the local gods, recognizing the power of Assur or of Marduk, abandon their own sanctuaries to pay homage to him. This is displayed by the physical transfer of the local god to the city and the temple of the conquerors. The removal of foreign gods to Assyria is a common theme and is interpreted by both conquered and conquerors as the wish of the local god. As is often pointed out, this ideology was shared by the prophet Ezekiel and emphasized in his writings (Hurowitz 1992: 268; Kutsko 2000: 108; Zimmerli 1979: 251–54). Yhwh’s abandonment is vividly described, an abandonment that leaves both temple and city vulnerable to destruction:
Then the Kavod of Yhwh rose from on the Kerub to the threshold of the Temple, and a cloud filled the temple, and the brightness of the Kavod of Yhwh filled the court. (Ezek 10:4)

And the Kavod of Yhwh went out from on the threshold of the Temple and rested on the Kerubim. And the Kerubim raised their wings and lifted off the earth before my eyes when they went out, with the wheels with them. They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Temple of Yhwh and the Kabod of the God of Israel was above them. This was what I saw under the God of Israel at the River Kebar, and I realized that they were Kerubim. Four, four faces each had, and each had four wings, with the likeness of human hands under their wings. And the image of their faces was that of the faces that I saw on the River Kebar, when I saw them. (Ezek 10:18–22a)
Then the Kerubim raised their wings and the wheels were with them, and the Kavod of the God of Israel was upon them from above. Then the Kavod of Yhwh went up from above the midst of the city and stopped on the mountain that was east of the city. And the Spirit lifted me and carried me to Chaldea to the exiles by means of the appearance of the Spirit of the God, and the appearance that I saw was upon me. (Ezek 11:22–24)
Ezekiel describes here his vision of the Presence of Yhwh. The Presence leaves his usual place on the Kerubim in the inner sanctum, goes up to the threshold, and from there out of the Temple through the east gate, out of the city to the mountain east of it, and then to Chaldea. Since this was the same vision he saw on the Kebar River, Ezekiel realized that Yhwh had left the temple, had left the city open to destruction (9:10), and had come to the exiles in Babylon. None of this is present in the Jews’ account of the destruction of their temple at Elephantine. The destruction there is attributed solely to “that evil Vidranga” (TAD A4.7). The people had not sinned; their god had not left the temple open to destruction. This may be because the dismantling was initiated by order of a local governor, not military conquest.
The Ideology of Temple Restoration
In addition to a common ideology of conquest, there is a common ideology in the ancient Near East of temple-restoration after conquest (Albrektson 1967; Cogan 1974; Holloway 1992; Hurowitz 1992; Kutsko 2000). The motivation to restore a destroyed shrine begins with the willingness of the god who abandoned it to move back in. Shrines are then rebuilt to receive the god. Essarhaddan says, “(I am he who) returned the pillaged gods from Assyria and Elam to their shrines, and who let them stay in comfortable quarters until their temples could be completed for them” (Cogan 1974: 29). Sargon says, “I returned the



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 31
pillaged gods to their cult centers and restored their interrupted regular offerings”(Cogan 1974: 31). In his discussion of temporary temples, Hurowitz (1993: 40–41) summarizes an eighth-century text of Ninurta-kudurro-ußur, governor of Suhu and Mari, according to which “the people of a city named Anat, in rebellion against Suhu, hired Assyrians who desecrated the temple of the goddess Anat and had her dwell in a secret place (puzru). [Ninurta-kudurro-ußur] restored her temple and regalia, reinstituted her (apparently in her restored temple) and reestablished her ancient rites” (Cavigneaux 1914: 321–456, Tab. 335–38). The temple is restored in order to receive the god. Hurowitz (1993: 42) also reports a pseudepigraphic inscription of the Kassite king Agum-kakrime that states that, after many years in exile, Marduk decided to return home to Babylon. The god was housed in appropriate temporary quarters in Babylon until the Esagil could be restored (Longman 1983). Although this is a literary text, it illustrates the ideology of temple restoration: rebuilding is begun to welcome the god back into his home. Sometimes restoration is delayed even after the god’s return, and the god remains in temporary quarters until rebuilding is complete. The stele of Nabonidus reports that
(As to) the goddess Anunitum (now) residing in Sippar, whose residence in old time a (victorious) enemy had removed to Arrapha and whose sanctuary the Gutians had destroyed, and whose cult Neriglissar had renewed and whose (image) he had clad with an attire befitting her godhead, [Neriglissar] made her stay (provisionally)—her own temple being in ruins—in a chapel in Sippar-Amnanu arranging (only) for her nidbû offerings [to be sent to her]. (ANET: 309)
The goddess resided in temporary quarters until her own residence could be rebuilt. There had been no attempt to rebuild the temple until she had been returned from her exile. This is also true of the temple Ehulhul in Harran, dedicated to Sin. According to the Nabonidus stele, it lay in ruins 54 years until Sin was appeased and agreed to return to it:
As to the temple É.hul.hul in Harran which was in ruins for 54 yearsthrough a devastation by the Manda-hordes the(se) sanctuaries were laid waste—the time (predestined) by the gods, the moment for the appeasement (to wit) 54 years, had come near, when Sin . . . returned to his place. (ANET: 311)
Finally, the Cyrus Cylinder has Cyrus say: “I returned to (these) sacred cities . . . , the sanctuaries of which have been in ruins a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries.” (ANET: 316)



32 Lisbeth S. Fried
Written by the Marduk priesthood, the Cyrus Cylinder describes the role of the Babylonian king and the ideology of temple-restoration. All of these texts make clear that the return of the image is a necessary precondition for rebuilding a sanctuary devastated in war. The return of the god implies his willingness to reside in the temple dedicated to him. It is only then that a temple is rebuilt. Many temples were never rebuilt.1 Shrines in the Levant, peripheral to the great empires of Egypt and Assyria, were seldom restored after conquest, the Temple in Jerusalem being a striking exception. The great Bronze Age Migdal or Fortress Temple at Shechem, a second large temple there, and another small sanctuary at the site were all destroyed in a twelfth-century conflagration attributed to Abimelech (Judges 9). None of the temples was rebuilt. A cult site at Lachish (Level V) and at another at Ekron were destroyed by Pharaoh Sheshonq. Neither was rebuilt. The great Bronze Age temples in Megiddo were destroyed in an enemy onslaught; they were not rebuilt. The cult site at Taanach was destroyed in a conflagration attributed to Pharaoh Sheshonq. It was not rebuilt. Two cult sites at Tel oAmal were destroyed in a conflagration that the excavator dates to the end of the tenth century. They were not rebuilt. The cult site at Kedesh was destroyed in a violent conflagration attributed to Tiglath-pileser III. It was not rebuilt. Cult sites at Lachish, Tel Sheva, and Tel Óalif continued in use until their destruction by Sennacherib in 701. None was rebuilt. The towns were rebuilt, but not the cult sites. The Temple to Ishtar in oAin Dara in Northern Syria illustrates the situation of conquered temples in cities on the periphery of empire (Abu Assaf 1993: 155–71).2 Built in three stages, the temple was in continuous operation for 500 years. First erected in the thirteenth century, it was renovated or rebuilt in approximately 1000 b.c.e., and between 900 and 740 a walkway and decorative orthostats were added to the exterior. The temple was destroyed by Tiglath-pileser III between 742 and 740. It was not rebuilt. After its destruction it lay exposed for half a century, while its stones were robbed and plundered. Domestic buildings were finally built above it in the seventh century. The excavator wonders why the temple was not rebuilt after its eighth-century destruction. Conquerors do not often bother to return gods or cult

Based on a comprehensive study of Mesopotamian and Northwest Semitic inscriptions, Hurowitz delineates the typology of templebuilding accounts ubiquitous in the ancient Near East (Hurowitz 1992: 131–310). His work agrees with Ellis’s (1968) previous effort on foundation deposits and ceremonies. As Younger’s (1990) study of the role of ideology in history-writing makes clear, stages in ancient Near Eastern building stories are more than a series of episodes in an inscription; they present the ideology of temple building. They encode the grammar that enables a particular temple-building project to be understood. Hurowitz’s schema (augmented by the work of Ellis) is as follows:
A. A brief history of the temple—why was it in ruins?3 B. The decision to build 1. The king receives a divine command 2. Additional aspects may be included a. The god is reconciled to his city or temple b. A specified, preordained period of time is concluded c. The king clarifies the divine will—through extispicy, divination, prophetic visions, and so on. Rarely, the initiative comes from the king himself, in which case this last step is doubly important. C. The acquisition and preparation of building materials 1. Building materials are brought from the ends of the earth 2. Foreign peoples contribute (involuntarily during the Assyrian period; voluntarily in the Persian period) 3. Wood is brought from Lebanon and floated down the river to the building site. D. Laying the foundations and preparation of the site 1. The ruler participates in the foundation rites, and they are often done according to the prescription of a diviner or prophet. 2. If a new temple is built on the site of an old one, lamentations are sung by lamentation priests to placate the gods and bridge the gap between the old temple and the new. A stone taken from the old temple is placed in the new one during construction. Lamentations are made for the old temple until the new temple is completed. E. A ceremony for later building stages (e.g., the dedication of the altar or the anointing of doors and sockets in preparation for the god’s entrance)
3. The following schema is based on Hurowitz (1992) with expansions from Ellis (1968).



34 Lisbeth S. Fried
F. The description of the completed temple and its furnishings 1. A description of the temple 2. A statement that the temple has been built G. The dedication ceremony of the finished building 1. The god is installed in the temple and takes up residence 2. Celebration 3. Presentation of gifts and appointment of temple personnel H. Prayer or curses
The Ideology of the Temple’s Restoration in Jerusalem
The description of the Jerusalem Temple’s restoration appears in Ezra 1–6. These chapters begin with a notice of the decision to build under Cyrus (Ezra 1:1, 2) and end with a statement that the Temple was finished, a description of its dedication, and a subsequent celebration under Darius I (Ezra 6:13b–22). It is clear, however, that these chapters do not comprise a building inscription. It is not possible to go through the intervening verses and place them in the schema outlined above in the way that was possible of the conquest account in 2 Kings 24–25. These initial chapters in Ezra are a hodgepodge: they are in both Hebrew and Aramaic, they include letters to and from a series of different Persian kings, as well as a narrative segment about squabbles between various groups of residents. Williamson has suggested that the historian who compiled Ezra 1–6 wrote his narrative long after the events described based on a set of independent sources that he had at his disposal (Williamson 1983: 1–30; 1985: xxiii–xxiv). Indeed, these chapters could not have been completed before 465 and the beginning of the reign of Artaxerxes I, since they include letters to and from that king (4:7–22). Williamson considers the historian’s sources to be: (1) the decree of Cyrus (1:2–4); (2) the inventory of temple vessels (1:9–11); (3) the list of people returning (chap. 2); (4) two letters that the historian summarizes in 4:6 and 7; (5) a letter in Aramaic from Rehum and others to Artaxerxes (4:8–16); (6) Artaxerxes’ reply (4:17–22); (7) a letter from Tattenai to Darius (5:6–17); and (8) Darius’s reply (6:3–12), which includes the transcript of a separate decree by Cyrus (6:3–5; Williamson 1983: 1–30; 1985: xxiii–xxiv). To Williamson, the remaining material was composed freely by the historian based on the prophetic books of Haggai and Zechariah and on events from his own day. It is proposed here that, in addition to sources 2–8, and instead of a decree by Cyrus, the historian had the Second Temple’s building account available to him as a separate source.



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 35
If the material available to the historian included a building inscription, it should be possible to weed out the extraneous narrative portions, lists, and letters that he added. The result should be a building story that corresponds to the schema outlined above. Hurowitz suggests that Ezra 1–6 was written as a composite of two separate building accounts, one describing its beginning under Cyrus and the other its completion under Darius (Hurowitz 1992: 118). This is possible, since the first part (set in the time of Cyrus) is in Hebrew, and the second part (set in the time of Darius) is in Aramaic. On the other hand, a single building account could have been supplemented later. The Inscription of Udjahorresnet may be an example: it describes temple restoration activities under Cambyses and then later under Darius (Lichtheim 1980: 36–41). It is also possible that an original unitary building inscription—written after the final dedication in the sixth year of Darius—was bilingual. It would have been composed in Hebrew for the local population and in Aramaic for the chancellery. Such bilingual inscriptions were usual in the Achaemenid Empire (Fried 2002). If such a building inscription lies within the initial chapters of Ezra, it would reveal Jewish history and ideology in the last third of the sixth century.
A. Brief History of the Temple
This is not present in Ezra 1–6 except in Tattenai’s letter to Darius, a separate source.
B. The Decision to Build
1. The king receives a divine command, usually in his first year
In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in order to complete the word of Yhwh by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yhwh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, and he sent a herald throughout all his kingdom and also by writing, saying: Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia, “All the kingdoms of the earth Yhwh, God of Heaven, has given me, and he charged me to build a Temple for him in Jerusalem which is in Judah.” (Ezra 1:1, 2)
These statements contain the requisite ingredients for the beginning of a temple-building inscription. They name the king, they state his year in office (the appropriate first year), they state the god whose temple it is, and most importantly they state that the impetus for the templebuilding came by a divine command from the god to the king. Consistent with a building inscription for a Temple of Yhwh in Jerusalem, it is written by and for Jews. The language is Hebrew, the



36 Lisbeth S. Fried
reference to Jeremiah is relevant only to Jews, and the phrase “to stir up the spirit” is a Hebrew idiom. These are strange if interpreted as a genuine edict of Cyrus (or even if interpreted as Cyrus’s response to an official Jewish request). However, they are entirely appropriate in a building inscription for a Jerusalem Temple. There is no need for building inscriptions of local temples to use the language or idioms of the Achaemenid bureaucracy.4 The Inscription of Udjahorresnet describes the restoration of the temple of Neith in Sais, Egypt, which was begun under Cambyses and completed under Darius. It is written completely in hieroglyphs, uses expressions and idioms peculiar to Egyptian culture and, while naming the Persian emperors, gives due credit to Neith, the mother of God (Lichtheim 1980). Kuhrt and others (Kuhrt 1990: 119–55; Harmatta 1974: 29–44) have shown that the famous Cyrus Cylinder is a foundation document for the restoration of the Esagil, the temple of Marduk in Babylon. That too employs the language and idioms of the Babylonian priesthood, not the Achaemenids. Halpern (1990: 88) objects that there is no narrative statement that the exiles actually decided to build the Temple. This is true and conforms completely to the building-story genre. In the ideology of temple-building, it is not the exiles who decide to build. The decision to build comes from the god to the king who has the power to build it. Some commentators argue the text is “a free creation of the editor” and point to the numerous discrepancies between it and Cyrus’s command to Sheshbazzar described in Tattenai’s letter to Darius (Ezra 6:3–5; Bedford 2001: 128, 180; Blenkinsopp 1988: 74). If it is a free composition of the historian, it is odd that the king named is no native king—neither Sheshbazzar nor Zerubbabel—but the Persian emperor. Naming Cyrus as the king to whom Yhwh gives his command is a recognition that he, not the Davidic heir, is Yhwh’s choice as interlocutor. This is unlikely to have come from the historian himself. It has been argued that Cyrus’s title “King of Persia” is anachronistic (Bedford 2001: 120–22; Halpern 1990: 91). The title is never used in any of Cyrus’s inscriptions and is not used for Achaemenid kings before Darius I (Kent 1950; Lecoq 1997). However, this is precisely when this building inscription must have been written—the 6th year of Darius I, at the time of the building’s dedication (Ezra 6:15). Bedford argues that the term “God of heaven” is anachronistic (Bedford 2001: 122–28). This term is sometimes applied to local gods by non-Persians in an attempt
4. This has been the major problem in accepting the authenticity of the so-called Cyrus Edict in Ezra 1:2–4. An excellent review of the literature can be found in Bedford (2001: 114–81).

to equate their god with Ahura Mazda,5 but Ahura Mazda only became the god of the Achaemenids under Darius I.6 The phrase is anachronistic if the text is offered as a genuine edict of Cyrus but not if it is a building inscription from the 6th year of Darius. It has also been thought odd that Cyrus, the Persian emperor, would use the term “God of Israel” when the Achaemenid bureaucracy customarily referred to the area as Yehud. Yehud and Shomron are the terms used on official seals, never Israel (Avigad 1976). The term Israel seems to have been used only by the Judean exiles in Babylon (Bedford 2001: 116; Williamson 1994: 41–42). Both Deutero-Isaiah and Ezekiel refer to the exiles as the People Israel, or the House of Israel. Deutero-Isaiah may have created Yhwh‘s title as the Holy One of Israel (Williamson 1994: 41–42). Bedford notes that the term is not used in the Elephantine papyri and concludes that it originated among the exiles in Babylon. If so, it points to the Babylonian origin of the author of the underlying building account. None of these supposed anachronisms is a problem if these verses are understood to stem from a building inscription written in the 6th year of Darius I by a Jewish returnee from Babylon. According to Ezra 1:1, 2, a herald announced the decision to rebuild the Temple throughout the kingdom and there was also a written document, this last remark stated almost as an afterthought (1:1). A written document disseminated throughout the kingdom is not likely. Had there been one, the Jews would have been able to present it to Tattenai when he requested it (5:3; Halpern 1990: 91). It was lack of a written edict that necessitated Tattenai’s letter to Darius. Nor is it likely that a herald was sent throughout the Empire without a written edict. As one of Arsames’ letters makes clear (TAD A6.1), and as was true throughout history, heralds were high court officials who read the edicts they proclaimed; they did not recite official proclamations from memory (Postgate 1992: 285–86).7 More likely, the situation was as described in Tattenai’s letter to Darius: Cyrus gave an order to Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor, to take Yhwh’s vessels from
5. Herodotus equated Zeus (I 131) with Ahura Mazda and implied that the Babylonians equated Marduk with him (I 183). The Elephantine Jews equated Yhw with him in TAD A 4.7. See T. M. Bolin 1996: 127–42. 6. Cyrus’s religion is unknown, but the first Achaemenid royal inscriptions to mention Ahura Mazda are those of Darius I. 7. A text (KAJ 310:20 [MA]) cited in CAD S/2 167 affirms that proclamations are physical tablets read out by the herald:
1 quppu sa sasu nagiri sa bitati sa GN
1 chest containing the proclamations of heralds concerning the (purchase of) houses in the city of Assur.

the Esagil to Jerusalem, to rebuild the Temple there, and to install the vessels in it. Presumably Sheshbazzar did not go alone but brought with him a contingent of Jews. The phrase μaf μç in Tattenai’s letter is used throughout Arsames’ letters (TAD A6.1, A6.3, A6.7, etc.) to indicate a simple command to a subordinate. There is no mention in either Tattenai’s letter to Darius or in Darius’s response of an order to anyone but Sheshbazzar. Had there been a general edict, the Jews certainly would have retained a copy of it. The language of these two verses fits the language of a building inscription; it does not fit the language or idioms of an official Persian edict.
C. The Acquisition and Preparation of Building Materials
1. Contributions come from all over the world, from foreign peoples and kings
Who among you from all his people, let his God be with him. Let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and rebuild the house of Yhwh the god of Israel, that is, the God that is in Jerusalem. And all who remain in the places where he had sojourned, the men of his place, they shall assist him with silver, gold, cattle, and animals, along with the freewill contributions to the house of the God in Jerusalem.
The heads of the clans of Judah and Benjamin, the priests, and the Levites, all whom the God stirred up his spirit to go up and build the house of Yhwh that is in Jerusalem got up. And all around them strengthened their hand with vessels of silver, of gold, with cattle, and animals. (Ezra 1:3–11)
This idea is common to building inscriptions in the ancient Near East. Commentators explain this “despoliation of the neighbors” as the historian’s “direct concern to present the return as a second Exodus” (Blenkinsopp 1988: 75–76; Williamson 1985: 16). It may point instead to Persian embellishments of an original exodus story. As noted above, a common component of temple-building inscriptions is that men and kings come from all over the world to contribute their wealth to the new temple. If those in this passage described as “left behind” are considered to be non-Jews making free-will offerings to the Jews who return, then this is reminiscent of Persian-period building inscriptions (Hurowitz 1985: 21–30; 1992: 207; Root 1979: 17–23). At that time, a description of free-will donations from foreigners was common in building inscriptions. As Hurowitz (1992: 208–10) notes, although this is not

unique to the Persian period and goes back to Gudea, it is still quite different from Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian building accounts. In these accounts, materials are also brought from all over the world, but they are from vassals subject to the Assyrian and Babylonian kings; they are not portrayed as free-will offerings. It is by the mighty strength of the Assyrian or Babylonian gods that the material is brought, rather than because of a spontaneous desire to honor the temple and the god, as is portrayed in building inscriptions from the time of Darius. The text continues with a reference to the Temple vessels:
King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of Yhwh that Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and deposited in the house of his god. Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out by Mithradates the ganzabara, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar, the Nasi of Judah. (1:7–11)
Halpern (1990: 89) objects that Sheshbazzar’s return is referred to obliquely here but not directly reported. However, according to the literary genre of the building story suggested here, the goal is not to report a history of the return but to portray the wealth of nations pouring in from all over to contribute to the Temple’s construction. Sheshbazzar is named here because he is part of this portrayal. He has no independent significance. Halpern (1990: 89) argues further that, since the original decree provided for the vessels’ return (6:3–5), the notice of their return should have been included as part of the edict quoted in 1:2–4. Yet, the inclusion here, as part of the wealth flowing to the Temple, and its exclusion from the description of the decision to build are consistent with the format and ideology of a building inscription.
These [vessels] that were counted out were:
Agartley gold 30 Agartley silver 1000 Ma ̇alaphim 29 Kiphorey gold 30 Kiphorey silver 90 Other vessels 1000 All the vessels of gold and silver 5400 All these, Sheshbazzar brought up with the ones who went up of the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem.
The form of the list is identical to accounts in the Elephantine papyri and in the Persepolis tablets (Hallock 1969; Porten and Yardeni 1986). The names of the items are obscure and may be Persian. The amounts



40 Lisbeth S. Fried
do not total correctly; the list has become corrupt in transmission. This inventory is not likely to have been part of the original building inscription and stems from a separate source. Most commentators (Blenkinsopp 1988: 78–79; Williamson 1985: 7–8) agree that it goes back to a genuine list of vessels returned to the Temple of Yhwh in Jerusalem. In its present position in the building story, the list of Temple vessels simply represents another aspect of building materials coming from all over the world—including from foreign kings like Cyrus. In his discussion of the Temple vessels, Ackroyd (1987) argues that the intent of the final redactor of 2 Kings 24 and 25 was to stress that these vessels were brought to an end. To Ackroyd, the list in Ezra 1 is fictitious; the account in Kings leaves “no room for restoration” (Ackroyd 1987: 53). As noted above in the discussion of the Kings passage, it is not necessary to translate the Hebrew of 2 Kings to imply that all the vessels were destroyed, and many commentators do not (Cogan and Tadmor 1988: 316).8 Moreover, it is well known that Nebuchadnezzar regularly deposited captured booty in the Esagil. According to Vanderhooft (1999), the following text is representative of Nebuchadnezzar’s inscriptions:
Gold, silver, exceedingly valuable gemstones, thick cedars, heavy tribute, expensive presents, the produce of all countries, goods from all inhabited regions, before Marduk the great lord, the god who created me, and Nabû his lofty heir who loves my kingship, I transported and brought into Esagil and Ezida.9
It is most likely that gold and silver vessels from the Temple in Jerusalem were among the goods contributed to Marduk’s store. Ackroyd (1987: 57) stresses that the vessels’ return is a continuity theme for the writer, whom he considers to be the Chronicler. But their return is more than a literary topos. As Williamson (1985: 16) notes, “the deposit [of temple vessels] in the temple of the victor’s god was intended to underline to the devotees [of the conquered god] the inability of their god to save.” It also indicated the power of the god in whose temple the items were stored over the god who was conquered. The text of Ezra continues in chap. 2 with a list of the returnees. This is not likely to have been part of an original building inscription but was likely inserted by the historian. It is a natural place to insert the

list. A list of people returning from Babylon to Judah follows naturally on the heels of the list of vessels also returning from Babylon to Judah. Following the list of returnees, the text jumps to “the seventh month when the people Israel are in their cities” (3:1). This phrase is repeated in Neh 7:72b[73b] where it introduces Nehemiah 8. This chapter fits uneasily in its context, so it is difficult to know the statement’s origin. Here, in Ezra 3:1, the verse is followed by a reference to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, and Yeshua, the high priest, implying the seventh month of a year in the reign of Darius. The text continues to describe the erection and the dedication of the altar (3:2, 3) and adds that all the traditional holidays were celebrated—the Feast of Sukkot, as well as the daily and monthly offerings (3:3b–6a). Compared to traditional building accounts, the dedication of the altar here is out of order. Later, the text states that the foundations were not yet laid (3:6b), a resumptive clause. The historian rearranged the order traditional to building accounts (laying the foundations, building the temple, building the altar, dedicating the temple) to convey the zealousness of the returnees and to imply that all the offerings were performed according to the prescribed law from the first arrival in Jerusalem. The erection of the altar actually belongs to one of the last stages of Temple construction (Ellis 1968: 32–33). The altar will be discussed below in the context of its likely original position in the Second Temple’s building account.
2. Wood is brought from Lebanon and floated down a river to the site
And they gave silver to the stonemasons and woodcutters, as well as food and drink and oil to the Sidonians and the Tyrians to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Yaffo, according to the grant that Cyrus king of Persia gave us. (Ezra 3:7)
This statement is common to temple-building inscriptions, even to the point of floating wood from Lebanon down to its destination. Commentators uniformly note the similarities between this and the building account of the First Temple in 1 Kings 8. They assert that, because there is no reference to timber in either Tattenai’s letter to Darius or the return letter from him, its mention here is simply to recall the First Temple. More likely, the references in both building accounts are simply aspects common to building inscriptions in the ancient Near East. They are part of the genre. This does not make it fictitious. The roof of the temple of Yhw in Elephantine was of cedar beams (TAD A4.7); they must have been shipped from Lebanon by sea in the manner described here. Further, the items paid the Sidonians and Tyrians are typical of allocations to workers reported in the Persepolis tablets (Hallock 1969).



42 Lisbeth S. Fried
Following the statement of gathering wood from Lebanon, another insertion appears—another comment about Zerubbabel and Yeshua, the priest:
In the second year of their coming to the house of God in Jerusalem in the second month, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Yeshua, son of Yozadak, and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began and they appointed Levites from 20 years old and up to supervise the work of the house of Yhwh. And Yeshua appointed his sons and brothers Qadmiel, and his sons the sons of Judah, to supervise the carrying out of the work on the house of God. (Ezra 3:8–9)
It is likely that this is an insertion from a later point in the building story—or even a free creation of the historian. Hurowitz (1992: 56) has shown that temple personnel are usually appointed after the temple is constructed and after the god is brought into it. That seems the appropriate place. The reference to Zerubbabel and Yeshua the priest in the second year of their coming to Jerusalem gives the impression that they came to Jerusalem in the first year of Cyrus, under Sheshbazzar. This is an attempt by the historian to compress the entire Templebuilding process into a few years to convey the zeal of the founding community. If part of the original building inscription, it may be that Zerubbabel and Yeshua came to Jerusalem in the second year of Darius (as implied by the writings of Haggai and Zechariah), and in the fourth year, the second year of their coming, they inaugurated a priesthood. Inauguration at this later stage would be more consistent with traditional building accounts in the ancient Near East. Next comes the text that describes the actual foundation-laying and the ceremonies surrounding it.
D. Laying the Foundations
1. Mesopotamian rulers usually participated in the foundation rites, and they were often done according to the prescription of a prophet or diviner
And the builders laid the foundations of the Temple of Yhwh. (3:10a)
There is no mention here of Sheshbazzar or any other ruler, leading the ceremonies. Because of this, Williamson states categorically that Sheshbazzar did not lay the foundations and that the work did not go on continuously from then until the first year of Darius as reported in Tattenai’s letter to that king (5:16; Williamson 1985: 79). Yet, these assertions are corroborated by Tattenai’s own assessment of the situation



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 43
in 5:8, to which Williamson (1985: 78) has no adverse reaction. Blenkinsopp (1988: 122) agrees that Sheshbazzar did not participate in templebuilding. To him, the statement in Tattenai’s letter to Darius regarding Sheshbazzar was fabricated by the Jewish community in Jerusalem to gain prestige for the temple. He also suggests that the way in which Sheshbazzar is referred to (for example, “a Sheshbazzar by name,” 5:14) is not complimentary and that the man had become persona non grata to the Persians (Blenkinsopp 1988: 122–23). If so, it is difficult to see how mention of his name would add prestige in Darius’s eyes. Furthermore (assuming the historical reliability of the letters [Hensley 1977; Porten 1978–79: 174–96]10), it is not likely that the Jewish community would risk falsifying the facts; Darius did not look kindly upon the lie (drauga). It is more likely that Sheshbazzar’s name was omitted from the building account just because he had become persona non grata, and that in fact he had laid the foundations as is reported in the letter.
2. Ceremonies are conducted when the foundations are laid
The priests attended in their vestments with their trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with their cymbals, to praise Yhwh. . . . And they answered in praise and thanksgiving to Yhwh, because he is good and his steadfast love is forever over Israel. And all the people gave a great shout in praise to Yhwh because of the foundations of the Temple of Yhwh. (Ezra 3:10b–11)
This type of statement is typical of temple-building inscriptions.
3. If a new temple is built near the site of an old one, lamentations are sung by lamentation priests to placate the gods and to bridge the gap between the old temple and the new
And many of the priests, the Levites, the heads of the clans, the elders, who saw (war) the First Temple on its foundations (this is the Temple in their eyes) wept with a loud voice. (Ezra 3:12)
The verb (war) is usually translated ‘had seen’ and interpreted as referring to elderly people who had seen the original Temple, perhaps fifty years earlier. This may not be the intent of the verse. Thureau-Dangin (1921: 35–59) has published the Mesopotamian kalû ritual, the ritual prescribed for building new temples when an old temple lies in ruins.
10. Bedford (2001: 181) concludes the letters are genuine, but they are an “unreliable witness when compared to the writings of Haggai and Zechariah 1–8.”



44 Lisbeth S. Fried
The only text extant is from the Seleucid period, but it likely goes back to an older practice, certainly to the Persian period, if not before. The following are the instructions for the kalû, or lamentation priest:
When the wall of a temple falls into ruin, in order to demolish and then rebuild11 that temple, . . . the builder of that temple shall put on clean clothes and put a tin bracelet on his arm; he shall take an ax of lead, remove the mahritu brick, and shall put it in a restricted place. You set up an offering table in front of the brick for the god of foundations, and you offer sacrifices; you shall sprinkle every type of (aromatic?) grain; you will pour beer, wine, and milk (over the brick?); you will prostrate yourself (before the brick?). As long as you [they?] demolish and (re)build [the temple] you will offer water. Then the kalû priest will make a libation of honey, cream, milk, beer, wine, and [good] oil (over the brick?). The kalû-priest [shall recite] the (composition called) “Enuma Anu ibnu same.” . . . [A]s long as the demolishing and rebuilding (are going on), offerings and lamentations shall be made and the kalu-priest shall not cease strewing (aromatic?) flour and making libations and recitations. (Thureau-Dangin 1921: 40–43)
In his discussion of the enigmatic term libbitu mahritu (the mahritu brick) in this text, Ellis (1968: 26–29) concludes that it does not mean ‘first brick’, as it is often translated, but a previous brick, any previous brick from the former temple. It cannot be the first brick that was laid when the original temple was built. Bricks cannot be recognized by their inscriptions, because they are usually laid face down. In the kalû ritual, the builder removes a designated brick or stone from the old temple. He sets it aside. A kalû priest makes offerings and sings lamentations as long as the old temple is being demolished and the new temple is being constructed. He continues to sing lamentations until the new temple is completely built. Rather than referring to the weeping of very old men who remembered the first temple from almost fifty years earlier, the crying may refer to prescribed lamentation rites for the old Temple, whose ruins they still see before their eyes. Jacobsen suggests that the city lament, or balag, was composed after the destruction of a city for just such a purpose. Its recitation by kalû priests was an indispensable part of the
11. Thureau-Dangin (1921; followed by ANET, 339–42) and Ellis (1968: 184) translate the verb ‘to lay the foundations’, interpreting us-su-si from ussu ‘foundation’. Van Soden (AHw 1442) suggests rather the verb is the D stem of edesu ‘to renew’ (AHw, ussusu[m]). It is clear from the final section of the ritual, quoted here, that the rites continue during the entire construction of the building, not just when the foundations of the new temple are laid.



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 45
kalû ritual accompanying the restoration of the destroyed city’s temples (Jacobsen 1940: 219–24). The balag-lament includes a vivid description of the city lying desolate and of the attack that devastated it (1940: 22223). Whether the city has been rebuilt or not, it is lamented as being in ruins and empty until the new temple is finished and dedicated.12 The weeping described in Ezra 3 may be part of such a lamentation ritual, perhaps over a stone that had been set aside from the ruins of the first temple. Indeed, the hçarh ˆba that Zerubbabel brings out (Zech 4:7) may be a stone that had been set aside by the “builder” during the foundation ceremony (Ezra 3:10a).13 The phrase hçarh ˆba has been translated ‘head stone’, ‘premiere stone’, ‘first stone’, and ‘top stone’.14 Yet there is reason to think it ought to be translated ‘formeryears’ stone’, which is also appropriate for the libbitu mahritu. BDB defines hçar, vocalized riasah, the singular of riasôt, as ‘beginning time, early time’. I might also suggest ‘former time’. This translation is based on Ezek 36:11, “I will increase upon you man and beast; they will greatly multiply, and I will cause you to dwell as in your early times (μkyt/mdqk), and I will cause more good than your former times (μkyt/çarm), and you will know that I am Yhwh.” At some point, the libbitu mahritu is incorporated into the new building. It is difficult to know when this occurs. The kalû ritual suggests it occurs very late in the construction process. Perhaps when the building is near completion but before the walls are paneled. It may be only then that the new temple becomes the temple in actuality; the act of inserting the brick may be what makes the transference complete. (Ezra 3:12 suggests that the old Temple lying in ruins was still the Temple in the eyes of the people.) If so, Zerubbabel’s incorporating the “formertimes” stone into the walls of the new Temple may be akin to laying its foundations (dsy; Zech 4:9; Hag 2:18). However, the kalû ritual
12. This is reminiscent of the current Jewish lamentation rite for the Temple on Tisha b’Av, the anniversary of the Temple’s destruction. Jews will continue to wear mourning garb, fast, and recite the book of Lamentations on Tisha B’Av until the Temple is rebuilt. The book of Lamentations, describing the devastation and desolation of Jerusalem in the present tense, is read even though the city is now a bustling metropolis. 13. See Halpern (1978: 167–89) and other references cited there. The application of the ritual proposed here is different from that proposed by Halpern. Rather than Zerubbabel’s removing the stone from the ruins or from the mountain (where it was quarried?), I suggest that he simply brought it out from the restricted place where it had been kept. 14. “Top stone,” nrsv; “premiere stone,” Meyers and Meyers (1987: 228, 248). They consider it to be a stone from the First Temple, as does Petersen (1984: 237–42), who refers to it as “the former stone.”



46 Lisbeth S. Fried
prescribes that laments be sung for the old Temple as long as demolishing and rebuilding continue, presumably until the New Temple is dedicated, even after the libbitu mahritu is installed. Laments for the Temple in Jerusalem still continued into the 4th year of Darius, even after Zerubbabel laid the aeben riasah in the second year (Zech 7:1–3). In the light of the balag and the kalû ritual, Haggai’s and Zechariah’s references to the Temple still in ruins and to the city still devastated does not indicate that Temple-building had not been in progress since the return under Sheshbazzar. Ritual laments are prescribed throughout the building process until the new temple is dedicated.
E. Ceremonies Are Held during Later Stages of Building, for example, the dedication of the altar or the anointing of doors and sockets
In the seventh month . . . Yeshua, son of Yozadak, and his brothers, the priests, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel and sacrificed burnt offerings upon it, as is prescribed. . . . And they erected the altar on its place. . . . And they offered burnt offerings upon it to Yhwh morning and evening. (Ezra 3:1–3)
The reference to Yeshua, the priest, and to Zerubbabel suggest that this took place during the reign of Darius; the writings of Haggai and Zechariah place these men securely in this period. Although the location of these verses in the book of Ezra implies the altar was dedicated prior to laying the foundations, this is not likely. As stated above, altars are routinely built during later stages of construction, not before the foundations are laid (Ellis 1968: 32–33). It is impossible to know when this occurred. The reference to “the seventh month” is not reliable; such an auspicious month may have been inserted to suit the theological goals of the historian. Halpern (1978: 177–78) suggests that the four horns that symbolize the four enemies of Judah and Israel, mentioned in Zech 1:18ff., are the four horns of the altar. If so, the altar dedication would have occurred on the 24th day of the 11th month of Darius’s 2d year (Zech 1:7). Placing the building-story components according to their order in typical building accounts may provide the historical order of the Second Temple’s construction: the foundations were laid under Sheshbazzar; the altar much later, during the reign of Darius. At the foundation ceremony under Sheshbazzar and Cyrus, one designated “the builder” removed the “former-times” stone from the ruins of the old Temple. Later, during the reign of Darius, Zerubbabel installed it in the walls of the new Temple (Zech 4:7). No date is given in Zechariah, but Haggai



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 47
refers to a foundation ceremony in the 24th day of the 9th month of Darius’s 2d year. It is likely that this is the date when the aeben riasah, the “former-times” stone, was brought out and incorporated into the new building (Zechariah 4; Hag 2:18). After the statement of the dedication of the altar, the usual building account in the ancient Near East would have a description of the building and its furnishings. Instead, there is an account of a struggle between two groups (4:1–5), some letters to and from Kings Artaxerxes (4:7–22) and Darius (5:6–6:12), and an aborted letter to Xerxes (4:6). These were added by the historian to the original building account. The conflict between the Judeans and their “adversaries” was likely drawn from the historian’s own time and reflects his own world view. As has been pointed out (Bedford 2001: 172–180; Halpern 1990: 104), Haggai and Zechariah, writing in the time of Darius, give no indication of conflicts between various groups of people.
F. The Description of the Temple and Its F urnishings
1. A description of the Temple
This component is unaccountably missing.
2. A statement that the king has built the Temple
Then Tattenai, governor of Beyond the River, Shatar-bozenai, and their colleagues did diligently just as Darius the king ordered. [. . .] [T]hey built successfully by means of the prophesying of Haggai, the prophet, and Zechariah, son of Iddo, and they finished according to the command of the God of Israel and the command of Cyrus and Darius . . . king of Persia. They completed this house on the third day of the month of Adar, which is the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. (Ezra 6:13–15, Aramaic)
Although in Aramaic, this statement is typical of building inscriptions in the ancient Near East. The switch to Aramaic in the building account is worth noting. The original building inscription may have been bilingual, Hebrew and Aramaic, as was customary in contemporary official texts. The historian began by using the Hebrew version and switched to Aramaic when he inserted the Aramaic letters into his narrative. As appropriate in the Aramaic version, the credit for the Temple is given to Tattenai, the satrap, and to Shatar-bozenai and his colleagues, satrapal officials. The reference to “the elders of the Jews” may have been added by the historian or taken from the Hebrew version of the inscription.



48 Lisbeth S. Fried
G. The Dedication Ceremony
1. The god takes up residence in the temple
This component is noticeably missing. The mention above to Zechariah’s and Haggai’s prophecies may allude to their prophetic assurances that Yhwh has reconciled himself to his people and has entered the Temple.
2. Celebration
And the people Israel, the priests, and the Levites and the rest of the exiles dedicated this house of God with joy. And they offered at the dedication at the house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and he-goats as a sin offering on behalf of all Israel, twelve for the twelve tribes of Israel. (Ezra 6:16, 17, Aramaic)
This statement is typical of building inscriptions.
3. Presentation of gifts and appointment of Temple personnel
And they established priests according to their orders, and Levites according to their courses for the service of the God that is in Jerusalem [as has been prescribed]. (Ezra 6:18, Aramaic)
It is likely that this passage is original to the building inscription, rather than the earlier passage of Ezra 3:8, 9. That one may have been a free composition of the historian based on events from his own day. Zechariah 3 seems to refer to a ceremony for the inauguration of the high priest. If so, it may have occurred here after the dedication, in the 6th year of Darius. Or the high priest could have been installed in a separate ceremony earlier, perhaps when the altar was dedicated and the rest of the Temple personnel installed after the dedication. The source seems to end here. The historian himself added the celebration of the Passover (6:19–22), which is in Hebrew.
H. Prayer or Curses
The building account proper does not include a curse or prayer, although Darius places a very lovely one at the end of his letter. Perhaps his curse was included in the original building inscription and not repeated by the historian:
I issue an order that anyone who changes a word of this edict—a beam will be torn out of his house, he will be beaten and impaled upon it, and his house will be made into a dunghill on account of this. May the God who [causes his name to] dwell(s) there overthrow any king or people



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 49
who sends his hand to change or to harm the house of this God that is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, issue an order; let it be done with all diligence. (Ezra 6:11, 12)
The historian seems to have doctored Darius’s curse a bit to make it conform to Deuteronomistic theology.
Conclusion
The above analysis suggests that the historian who wrote Ezra 1–6 built his narrative around a building story, perhaps the Second Temple’s authentic bilingual building inscription. Nearly every component of the structure that marks the typical ancient Near East building account is present. The historian simply rearranged some of them to suit his theological motives; note, however, that the only items out of order are the notice of the altar dedication and the early notice of the priestly inauguration, both in chap. 3. He supplemented the building inscription with narrative, letters, a list of returnees, and a list of Temple vessels. To interpret the basic genre of Ezra 1–6 as a building account radically restructures the understanding of the history of this period. When the components are rearranged into the order typical of building stories, the actual historical order of events appears. The kalû ceremony for the demolition and rebuilding of new temples provides ideological background for events not fully explained by the building account itself. As deduced here, the temple was begun under Cyrus and the foundations laid by Sheshbazzar, when the “former-times” stone, the aeben hariasah, was removed by a person called the builder. It was brought out later by Zerubbabel from its protected place and installed when the Temple was near completion, probably in the 9th month of Darius’s 2d year. (The altar was dedicated in a separate ceremony two months later.) The act of incorporating the stone from the First Temple into a wall of the Second was spoken of as a foundation ceremony, even though the actual foundations had been laid many years before. Prior to the new Temple’s dedication, and as long as there was building going on, the Temple was spoken of as being in ruins, and laments were recited for it. There was no building gap; the Temple was continuously under construction from the time Sheshbazzar arrived, during the reign of Cyrus, until the 6th year of Darius, when it was dedicated. In addition to providing a better understanding of the historical and ideological background of the period, interpreting the structure of



50 Lisbeth S. Fried
Ezra 1–6 as a building story does away with the need to posit a Cyrus Edict. The so-called Edict of Cyrus (Ezra 1:2–4) is recognized to be simply the typical beginning of a typical building inscription. Looked at this way, the discrepancies between Ezra 1 and the dichrona, or memorandum, in Ezra 6 disappear. That Ezra 1 is in Hebrew and uses Hebrew idioms is expected in a Jerusalem temple-building inscription. That it speaks of the wealth of foreigners flowing to aid in building the new Temple is typical of Persian-period building accounts. The Second Temple’s building story was very likely available to the historian who wrote Ezra 1–6, and he manipulated it to reflect his own world view.
Were the Returnees Necessary to Restore the Temple in Jerusalem?
The ideology behind the building-story genre of the ancient Near East is apparent in Ezra 1–6, even if the components have been rearranged slightly and augmented. As remarked above, an ideology is a set of beliefs that encode events. Events can only be understood within the framework of a belief system; they have no independent meaning. A temple’s destruction by enemy conquest results from the anger and abandonment of its God; the temple’s restoration occurs when the god has been appeased and has deigned to return to his people. The god’s anger is expressed concretely by the capture of the image during conquest; his subsequent reconciliation is expressed in its return by the victorious monarch. Sixth-century Judeans shared this common worldview. The book of Kings describes the conquest in the same terms as other ancient Near Eastern conquest accounts. The book of Ezekiel describes how Yhwh abandoned his Temple in anger, leaving both city and Temple open to destruction. The Second Temple’s building inscription underlying the book of Ezra indicates that Jews living at the end of the 6th century also shared the ancient Near Eastern view of temple conquest and restoration. Thus, the decision to rebuild could not be made without proof that Yhwh had been appeased, that his anger had ended, and that he was willing to return to his Temple. Hurowitz (1992: 135–63) discusses the great lengths that kings went to ascertain the mood of the god. He states:
The king who builds a temple without permission [of the god] is courting disaster—either he will not complete the project successfully, or the completed building will not stand, and may collapse after completion. (Hurowitz 1992: 137)



Conquest and Restoration in the Ancient Near East 51
A primary way of indicating the will of a captured god is if he really does return home to his temple. Practically speaking, this means the king who controls the image actually returns it. Even so, the return demonstrates the god’s free will, as did its capture. If the God is aniconic, and the main representative of the God—the ark—has been destroyed, other objects must suffice to demonstrate his willingness to return (Ackroyd 1987). Temple cult vessels seem to have played this role. The location of his vessels indicates where Yhwh condescends to live, where he has taken up housekeeping, as it were.15 Cyrus’s return of the Temple vessels is mentioned three times in the first six chapters of Ezra: in the beginning of the building inscription (1:8–11), in Tattenai’s letter to Darius (5:14, 15), and again in Darius’ response (6:5). This suggests their importance. Deutero-Isaiah states what the return of the Temple vessels meant to him (Isa 52:11):
Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch nothing unclean. Go out from the midst of it, Purify yourselves, you who carry Yhwh’s vessels. You shall not go out in haste, And you shall not go out in flight, For Yhwh shall walk before you; The God of Israel shall be your rear guard.
To the Isaianic writer, the return of the vessels is visible proof that God himself is returning to his Temple in Jerusalem. In the same chapter, he writes:
8b. For eye to eye, they will see Yhwh’s return to Zion. (52:8)
When Cyrus came into possession of the Esagil, and of Yhwh’s vessels stored there, he came into possession of the decision to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The decision was his, not because he controlled Jerusalem, but because he controlled the vessels. That the first line of the underlying building inscription states that Yhwh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus and charged him to rebuild his Temple in Jerusalem demonstrates that the Jews participated fully in this common understanding of the mechanism of Temple-restoration after a military conquest. The impetus to build could not come from the local Judean population, who did not control the tangible visible proof of Yhwh’s presence.
15. This idea was suggested to me by V. (A.) Hurowitz, personal communication.



52 Lisbeth S. Fried
No temple could have been prepared for him in Judah while his dwelling-place still remained in Babylon. The biblical writers lament that their land lay desolate for seventy years. The kalû ritual provides the ideological background. It prescribes that the Temple and land be mourned from the time of the First Temple’s destruction in 586 until the Second Temple’s dedication in 516.

Where Is the “Myth of the Empty Land”
To Be Found?
History versus Myth
B. Oded
University of Haifa
General
The term myth1 is intentionally used twice in the title of this essay in order to highlight a parade of publications in the past two decades from a proliferating group of scholars who consider the Hebrew biblical texts relating to the ancient history of Israel to be entirely a story (not history) of “the mythical past” and “the myth of Israel” (Thompson 1999).2 Central personalities in the Hebrew Bible such as David, Solomon, and even Omri (Thompson 1999: 11–13) are mythical—bearers of legends and fictions—not historical figures. The kingdom of Judah with Jerusalem as its capital during the tenth–ninth centuries b.c.e. is a pure fantasy (Davies 1992: 67–70). The Bible, actually heavily wrapped in a shroud of theology and ideology, is useless for historical reconstruction and, to quote Thompson, “Our history of biblical tradition has come topsy-turvy. It is only a Hellenistic Bible that we know. . . . [T]he Bible is not the history of anyone’s past” (Thompson 1999: xv); the Old Testament, which “hardly predates the Greco-Roman Period” (Lemche 2000: 12), is a piece of propagandistic material for political and religious ends. The Jews during the Hellenistic period invented a series of myths, a myth of Origins, a myth of the Patriarchs, a myth of the Promised Land, a myth of the Pollution of the Land by the Canaanites, a myth of the Conquest and Judges, a myth of the United Monarchy, a myth of Exile and Return, a myth of Ezra, a Myth of the Empty
1. The original meaning of the Greek word ‘myth’ is a story about gods. But in the present context, this term has the meaning of imaginary or fictional persons and stories. 2. See the “Recommended Reading” in Thompson 1999: xvii–xix, esp. the books by H. Barstad, P. R. Davies, G. Garbini, N. P. Lemche, and K. W. Whitelam.

Land—myth, myth, myth, “which stretches now from Genesis to 2 Kings (at least)” (Carroll 1992a: 84). All of these myths were invented in order to provide an ethnically varied society, with a fabricated common history and a fictitious sense of its national identity. The name Israel was not used by the inhabitants of Judah for selfidentity before the Persian period—or perhaps even later. The very terms Eretz-Israel (1 Sam 13:19; Ezek 27:17) and The People of Israel are anachronistic and anathema in the eyes of the pan-myth practitioners, who predict that “such a scholarly academic genre as the one that goes by the name of ‘History of Ancient Israel’ probably has no future to speak of” (Barstad 1996: 36 n. 18). Instead, these scholars systematically and wittingly (and not devoid of political prejudices) employ the term Palestine and its derivatives, such as “Palestinian People,” “Palestinian homeland” (Carroll 1998: 65), “Palestinian state of Judah,” “Palestinian prophets,” “Palestinian Jews,” Palestinian culture,” “Palestinian perspective” (Carroll 1992b), “Palestinian origin of all of the Hebrew Bible” (Barstad 1996: 21), and even “Yahweh, the ancient deity of Palestine” (Thompson 1999: 204). The Old Testament distorted the history of Palestine. The invention of mythical ancient Israel by the Jews during the Persian/Hellenistic periods, in order to root their new identity in the ancient past, meant “silencing the Palestinian history” (Whitelam 1996). In this schema, the present political conflict is quite openly projected onto the ancient past and onto biblical studies (Pastor 1998: nos. 6, 90) under the aegis of pretentious academic research. Consequently, the question posed by the pan-myth proponents is this: “Is It Still Possible to Write a History of Israel?” (Lemche 1994). I shall conclude this very short introduction to the pan-mythic movement with the acerbic statement by N. P. Lemche: “From an historian’s point of view, ancient Israel is a monstrous creature. It is something sprung out of the fantasy of biblical historiographers and their modern paraphrasers, i.e., the historical-critical scholars of the last two hundred years.” The “historical-critical scholarship is a bluff.” Lemche advises us thus: “commit it to the dustbin. It is hardly worth the paper on which it is printed” (Lemche 2000: 6, 14). Certainly, it is perfectly legitimate to be a skeptic, to treat the ancient sources critically, including the Bible, and to call into question the previously held conceptions. Nevertheless, as W. W. Hallo asserts, we should “set reasonable limits to our skepticism” (Hallo 1990: 199).3

Where Is the “Myth of the Empty Land” To Be Found? 57
The Myth of the Empty Land
In the domain of studies on the land of Judah and the Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian period, there is a topic known in scholarly circles as “The Myth of the Empty Land,” which is part and parcel, or rather, a by-product of the thesis about “mythical ancient Israel.” Advocates of this theory of the Myth of the Empty Land are by no means all of one mind and should not be regarded as homogeneous concerning the nature and degree of the historical reliability of the Hebrew Bible. Nevertheless, despite the different approaches and nuances, and because of space limitations, one can point out some fairly common presumptions and similar central lines, mutatis mutandis, as follows: (1) The great majority of the inhabitants, heavily involved in cultural, religious, and economic activities, remained in Judah during the “exilic period” (586–538 b.c.e.), and only a few went into captivity (Barstad 1996: 42, 78; Thompson 1996: 214).4 The very distinction between preexilic and postexilic Judah should be regarded as mythical rather than historical. (2) The biblical descriptions of mass or total deportations and destructions are not history but story, defined as storytelling, myth, metaphor, fabrication, fantasy, and religious ideology rather than historical events. “The myth of exile arose sometime in the latter part of the first Millennium” (Lemche 1998: 87). The myth of exile was invented by a certain group as a political claim; “yet for whom ‘exile’ was not an experience” (Davies 1998: 136–37). (3) This “Myth of the Empty Land” was invented by the “holy race” (Carroll 1992b: 576; why not “holy seed”?) during the Persian, or rather, Hellenistic period, as a prerequisite for the return to Judah in order to upgrade the returnees as true Israel and to justify and legitimize the takeover of the land from the “aboriginal occupants of the land” (Carroll 1992a: 81–82, 84, 85), with the pretense of coming to Judah when it was clear of inhabitants. This “Babylonian ideology”

that created the myth of the empty land and the myth of exile and return “simply wrote these survivors [that is, those who remained behind—B.O.] out of existence” (Carroll 1992b: 574). The debate concerns unjustified seizure and possession of land from “the other people,” whether by a small “pressure group” of returnees (Carroll 1992a: 8889) or by non-Judean deportees from various countries during the Persian period (Thompson 1999: 190–225). The debate concerns usurpation of territory from the indigenous Palestinian population and absolutely not repossession of land. The myth of the empty land “reflects an ideology of occupation and control” (Carroll 1992: 83, 89). (4) The “traditional scholars” from the nineteenth century on, with their “paraphrastic recapitulating of the biblical stories” and “antiquated views” (Barstad 1996: 19, 26), “conspire and collaborate with the biblical texts” in furthering the myth of the empty land (Carroll 1998: 67) and thus create “preposterous views” (Barstad 1996: 42, 80). These are “unfortunately still looming in the scholarly rear garden” (Barstad 1996: 77). So, where can the “myth of the empty land” be found? It is worth noting at the start that all scholars who study Judah during the Neo-Babylonian period see fit to emphasize that the information available to us is very meager indeed, and the situation in Judah is shrouded in obscurity. In fact, the great majority of the events that the mythographers consider historical are taken from the Bible simply because it is impossible to write the history of ancient Palestine or ancient Israel without relying on the Bible, despite its tendentious nature and the fact that it was composed and ideologically edited centuries after the events described therein took place (Machinist 1994: 36). From what source do we know about Zedekiah? About the conquest of Jerusalem in 586? About Gedaliah in Mizpah? About the “vinedressers” and “ploughmen”? Barstad asserts at the end of his monograph about the Myth of the Empty Land: “we have seen from the archaeological, as well as from the biblical evidence, that there was a substantial [note that now, at the end of the monograph, it is “substantial” not the “great majority”—B. O.] continued settlement all over Judah” (1996: 81). What is the biblical evidence and what are the archaeological data for the problem of whether the land all over Judah was populated during the Neo-Babylonian period? How is it possible that at the same time and in the same Bible there is a myth about the emptiness of the land of Judah proper?

Where Is the “Myth of the Empty Land” To Be Found? 59
The Bible
2 Kings 17, 24, 25
Chapter 17 explicitly states that “the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel” (v. 20) and that Israel was carried away to Assyria (v. 23). The Assyrian king brought many deportees from Mesopotamia to the defunct Northern Kingdom of Israel (Naaaman and Zadok 2000: 177–83). From several passages in the Hebrew Bible it is clear that not all the Israelites had been deported (e.g., 2 Kgs 23:15–20; Jer 41:5; 2 Chr 30:1–11; 34:33; 35:18). In describing the conquest of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 597 b.c.e., the text states that the Babylonians carried away lk ta μylçwry. Since Nebuchadnezzar did not abolish the kingdom but replaced the deported king with Zedekiah, and since the text has nothing to do with the creation of a myth of empty city/land, it is evident that lk in this verse is in the end an exaggeration, a hyperbole, a stylistic device to express a great calamity. This is also Barstad’s own interpretation: “When the ancient writer says ‘all the people’ he does not mean ‘all the people’ but a large number” (1996: 31), “expressive of the totality of the disaster” (Thompson 1996: 214). Hyperbole was a conspicuous feature of ancient Near Eastern history writings. Tiglath-pileser III, for example, says, “The land of BitHumria. All of its people (puhur nisesu) I carried off to Assyria, Peqah their king I/they killed, and I installed Hoshea as king over them” (Tadmor 1994: 141). As for the deportation in 586 b.c.e., this is reported in 2 Kgs 25:11 (as well as in Jer 52:15–16) to have been massive (including the “rest of the multitude”), but at the same time and in the same passage it is explicitly said that the Babylonian officer did not deport everyone but left ≈rah tldm and there is mention of ≈rab raçnh μ[h (vv. 12, 22. For the typical “correcting note,” see also Deut 28:61–62; 1 Kgs 11:11–13). Hence, the phrase in v. 21, wtmda l[m hdwhy lgyw (see also 2 Kgs 17:19–23; Jer 52:27) as well as lk in Jer 43:4–5 cannot be taken literally, exactly as we saw above (and see also Jer 52:27 in comparison with Jer 40:11). Compare, for example, Amos 9:8, ynp l[m hta ytdmçhw
bq[y tyb ta dymça dmçh al yk spa hmdah, and Jer 4:27, lk hyht hmmç
hç[a al hlkw ,≈rah. The same applies to μ[h lk in v. 26. ‘All the people’ in this verse may very well relate to Mizpah, mentioned in v. 25, just as we read in Jer 40:12, “and they came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah” (and see also 2 Kgs 25:23; Jer 40:8; 41:16–18). Here too we can mention the typical Assyrian hyperbolic phrase, “all its population” were taken into captivity, even though it is apparent



60 B. Oded
that we are dealing with a trope and mere exaggeration, not the creation of a myth by the Assyrians with the intention of legitimizing or justifying the settling of deportees from other conquered countries in an empty land, in place of “the other people,” who had been deported. Hence we should interpret lk or wtmda l[m larçy/hdwhy lgyw as literary tropes and not interpret them ideologically (see Amos 7:17). The very word wtmda (‘his land’) in 2 Kgs 25:21 (see also 1 Kgs 8:34) makes the invention of emptiness of the land unnecessary, from the Deuteronomist’s (Dtr) point of view, because there would have been no need to legitimize or justify the repossession of the land by owners who were driven from their own land by force, a land promised by God to Israel. Accordingly, the book of Kings furnishes no unequivocal evidence for the myth of emptiness of the land of Judah during the exilic period. Moreover, even if we take “all the people” (v. 26) literally, encompassing the entire remnant in Judah after 586 (which is not the case), just claiming that this verse supports “the myth of the empty land” is not proof that the large majority was left in Judah.
Prophecies
Some passages in the prophecies are taken as an intimation of the existence of a myth of the empty land as a prerequisite for the return from exile. For example, in Jer 36:29 we read, “The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause man and beast to cease there.” Carroll takes this verse as proof of the existence of this myth: “Thus the Judean territory was emptied of human kind and beast” or was made “a kind of tabula rasa” (1992a: 81–82). In the same way he takes the vision of the two baskets of figs in Jeremiah 24 and the prophecy in chap. 29 as proof of the existence of a myth, according to which the returned exiles will “occupy the now emptied land,” and a “legitimation of the returned deportees’ takeover of the land” from “the other people” (1992a: 82–83). When dealing with prophecies, one should differentiate the language of threat and intimidation used to exhort people “to return to God” from the description of a certain factual or fictional state. A typical example is the vision of Isa 6:11–13; “Until cities be laid waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and land become utterly waste; until the Lord moves them far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land” (see also 1 Kgs 9:7; Ezek 6:3–5; 33:28–29). This is a threat in poetic style (like all prophetic texts) and not an ideological invention of a myth of empty land to legitimize a future return.



Where Is the “Myth of the Empty Land” To Be Found? 61
In Jer 25:9–14 there is a prophecy to the nations at large in which Jeremiah speaks of total destruction and perpetual desolations, saying that “the whole land shall be a desolation.” Can we claim that this passage reflects an ideological invention of the empty land in order to legitimize a future return? Jeremiah considers the deportees of 597 b.c.e. to be “good figs” because they have already been punished by deportation; he promises them a bright new future through his belief that God will grant salvation to his people and bring them back to the homeland, whereas those still in Judah during the reign of Zedekiah have continued with their transgression and abominations. Jeremiah threatens that they will be punished by being driven from the land (see also Jer 7:3–12). The issue here is rebuke and punishment, as are the curses in contracts from the ancient Near East and Deuteronomy, not legitimization of a “takeover” of the land from the indigenous inhabitants by the (future) returnees. The principle here is not to destroy “the other people” in order to make oaliyya5 possible but intimidation, punishment, repentance, and divine will. This is the idea in Lev 20:22: “Be careful then, to observe all my statutes and ordinances, lest the land into which I am about to bring you to live, vomit you out.” The issue of possession of the land or dispossession of “the other people” is not raised at all. Isaiah says: “Comfort you my people, said the Lord, that her time of service is accomplished, that her guilt is paid off.” No mention whatsoever of cleared and empty land as a prerequisite for the return. No legitimation for a return to the homeland is needed but repentance and the will of God concerning a radical new beginning. Ezekiel speaks of repentance and a new, pure heart, not of “annihilation and dispersion of the other people” as a prerequisite for Restoration (Carroll 1992a: 83). The exiles are coming to larçy tmda (Ezek 11:11, 17). The prophet speaks about ruins but with certain inhabitants designated as twbrjh ybçwy (33:24) and μlçwry ybçwy (11:15)—indeed ruins, but not ruins cleared of inhabitants. These passages in Ezekiel do not reflect a controversy between two groups in the
5. Carroll intentionally uses the Modern Hebrew term oaliyya “in order to make obvious connections between ancient and modern times and practices” (1992: 91 n. 2). Moreover, he readily admits that he writes his observations on the discussed subject thus: “I am very conscious of writing this piece during the Marching Season in Northern Ireland (July 1997), so can hardly avoid referring to the trek back from Babylon to Jerusalem as if it were a Grand March back to Jerusalem ‘Orangemenstyle’ ”( 1998: 70 n. 17). The very idea of a linkage between academic research of the ancient past with contemporary conflicts is preposterous and does not differ from political propaganda. Political propaganda is “created for very anti-historical purposes” (Thompson 1999: 195).

Persian province of Judah. In the book of Haggai there is no distinction between those who returned from Babylonia and those who had remained in the land (Hag 2:2–4; Grabbe 1992: 44). The prophets envisage a radical new beginning, not emptiness of the land on the one hand or a continuity of the “great majority” on the other. Zechariah calls the exiles to return and rejoin those already in the land (2:6–13; 6:9–15; 8:2–8). There is nothing in the text to indicate emptiness as a prerequisite for return. It is assumed by some scholars that some prophets even envisioned exile without any mention of return.6
The Book(s) of Ezra–Nehemiah
The book reflects the situation four to six generations after the first return from Babylonia. In Ezra–Nehemiah it is clear that twxrah ym[, ≈rah μ[ (‘the people of the land’) are not considered among those who are descendants of the returned exiles from Babylonia—that is, the people of Judah, Israel. But what is the identity of the “people of the land”? According to Ezra 4, the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin had been brought to the “cities of Samaria” by the Assyrian kings (Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal). Accordingly, the author of Ezra–Nehemiah considers the “adversaries” foreigners. Nevertheless, those who advocate the existence of the “myth of the empty land” are among the commentators who believe that they are the indigenous inhabitants who did not go into captivity and they were excluded from the Judean/Israelite community.7 If this interpretation were correct (and it is not), what about the “myth of the empty land” in Ezra–Nehemiah? Carroll’s answer is that besides the myth of emptiness invented for legitimizing and justifying oaliyya there was another myth, “a myth of the occupied land,” invented to “allow the holy community, on its return, to keep itself separate” from the polluted local inhabitants. So we have two contradictory myths at the same time, in the same place (Judah), in the same book, and within the same community! Haggai and Zechariah did not know such a myth. It is an established fact that the deportations were not total. There was a remnant dwelling among the ruins (Ezek 33:23). The Judeans (μydwhyh) are mentioned in Neh 4:6[12], probably referring to the descendants who had remained in the land.

In the list of returnees (Ezra 2; Nehemiah 7) many settlements were in the territory of Benjamin. This means that the author of Ezra–Nehemiah considered all the people of Judah and Benjamin to be returnees, whether or not they went into exile (Japhet 1981: 114).8 There is not the slightest hint in the book that “emptiness” of the land was a prerequisite for the resettlement of the returnees. From the viewpoint of the author(s) of Ezra–Nehemiah, such a myth is unnecessary. In the genealogy in Ezra 7:1–5 there is a linkage with preexilic persons. The author stresses the continuity between preexilic and postexilic features. Ezra is a descendant of the preexilic Seraiah (Ezra 7:1). Nehemiah repeats that Jerusalem is “the place of my fathers’ sepulchers” (Neh 2:3, 5). The Torah is the “Torah of Moses” (Ezra 7:6). In the book (see especially Ezra 3, 4, 5, 8; Nehemiah 8, 9, 13) there are repeated mentions of the deportation/exile as a punishment of the forefathers who inhabited the land before the exile. There is no mention of conflict in regard to fields or houses but in regard to religious laws and traditions (Neh 10:27–30). There is no stigmatization of the non-exiled (that is, indigenous inhabitants) as horrendous sinners who should be dispossessed (see the Pentateuch and the books of Joshua and Judges). Repossession is the word, not possession or retaking of the land from the “other people.” The main issue in Ezra–Nehemiah is separation from the “peoples of the land,” not possession of their land. In the eyes of the author, the land is not empty but full of foreigners. The bottom line is that in the book(s) of Ezra–Nehemiah there is no invention of a myth of the empty land during the exilic and postexilic periods in order to legitimize “oaliyya.”
Chronicles
The theory of the myth of the empty land capitalizes on 2 Chr 36:21, according to which the land was desolate for seventy years. The Chronicler took “another step towards the final establishing of the myth of the empty land” (Barstad 1996: 41). He created the myth of the empty land in order to facilitate a return of people to repopulate the land, the “imagined land of ‘Ancient Israel’” (Carroll 1998: 68). Who is this “people” whose return the Chronicler wants to facilitate, at least two centuries after Nebuchadnezzar, and at least eight generations after the Edict of Cyrus? The text lbb la brjh ˆm tyraçh lgyw in v. 20 refers to the
8. Japhet 1981: 114: “It is intentional legitimating of the people who were not exiled, made necessary because of the book’s understanding of the concept of Israel.”



64 B. Oded
rest that were left in Jerusalem in light of vv. 18–19 and of the dependency of v. 20 on the parallel verse in 2 Kgs 25:11, according to which the Babylonians carried away the people that were left in the city (Japhet 1993: 1074).9 It is quite clear that 2 Chr 36:21 is a Midrash on Lev 26:33–35 and 43 concerning the cessation of cultivation of the soil because of the broken covenant. Leviticus 26 has nothing to do with evacuation of the local inhabitants in order “to facilitate” the possession of the land by people who came from abroad. “Return” is not mentioned at all in Leviticus 26 but punishment and atonement are (v. 43; see also Deut 4:25–31). The words constitute a warning of divine punishment and not a prerequisite for restoration. Cessation of agricultural activity does not mean “annihilation and dispersion of the other people” or “land clear of all its occupants” in order to “represent the legitimation of the returned deportees’ takeover of the land” (Carroll 1992a: 82–83). Scholars who advocate the invention of the “myth of the empty land” should explain why, in the book of Joshua, a fictional composition from the Persian or Hellenistic period according to pan-mythic scholarship, there is no myth of the empty land in order to justify the possession of the “Palestinian homeland” or “the imagined land of ‘ancient Israel’ ”(Carroll 1998: 65, 68). “Seventy” years is a symbolic and unrealistic figure, following Jeremiah (29:10), yet Jeremiah himself does not speak of an empty land but of exile, and he addresses the Judean deportees in Babylonia as well as all nations (25:11–14). Moreover, the overall idea of the Chronicler is that there were always Israelites/Judeans in the “promised land” (Japhet 1997: 363–73). He does not even use the phrases from 2 Kings and Jeremiah (52:27) about the deportation of “all the people” or wtmda l[m hdwhy lgyw. To state that the Babylonian king deported the rest who survived (2 Chr 36:20, in Jerusalem; see above) is not to invent a myth of emptiness with the aim of legitimizing the future oaliyya to a “land purified from pollution and empty of people . . . as a prerequisite for return” (Carroll 1992: 80). The connection that Carroll makes between the idea of keeping a Sabbath for seventy years and the idea of the pollution of the land that should be empty and purified in order that “people may return to live in it” is misleading. First, the Chronicler does not refer to the pollution of the land but of the temple (2 Chr 36:14). Second, the idea of
9. Japhet 1993: 1074: “In fact, according to the Chronicler’s own description, the destruction fell upon Jerusalem alone. . . . There is no hint in the passage itself of any damage to the land of Judah or to its people.”



Where Is the “Myth of the Empty Land” To Be Found? 65
the pollution of the land in various compositions of the Bible is connected with the biblical perception of exile, not of redemption or restoration. The land was contaminated by Israel because of idolatry, unfaithfulness, and wickedness (Lev 18:24–36; 2 Kgs 16:3; 21:2). It needed purification by the deportation of the inhabitants and by being left uncultivated and waste for a fixed period. The idea of purifying the land has nothing to do with inventing a myth of the empty land in order to legitimize the possession of land “by annihilation and dispersion of the other people” (Carroll 1992a: 83). Be that as it may, again, presuming that the empty land was a myth does not conversely mean that the great majority of the inhabitants with their institutions remained intact in Judah proper.
Lamentations
Lamentations is referred to by the mythographers to demonstrate that not only the material culture remained as it was before 586 but also the spiritual culture—robust intellectual activity. Barstad contends, “when we find that poetry of such high quality in the book of Lamentations could actually be produced in Judah after the disaster of 586, it follows that other kinds of literary activity might also have taken place in Judah” (Barstad 1996: 81), and “consequently poetic texts of a very high literary quality actually were produce in Judah in the exilic period” (1996: 20). First, we can learn from what we have. We have no composition that can with certainty be attributed to a certain person (or circle) in Judah during the exilic period (contra Williamson 1999b: 253 n. 48). Even if we take for granted that the book of Lamentations (as well as, for example, Psalm 74) was composed in Jerusalem (Renkema 1998) immediately after the fall of Jerusalem (and it is not certain that this is the case: Gwaltney 1983; North 1993: 200), what is important for the present discussion is the content of the book. The impression one gets from it is of a ruined and empty city characterized by death, famine, misery, mass deportation, and desolation (Lam 1:1–4). The prophet Zechariah mentions the former days (8:11), which were worse because of God’s wrath (1:2), in contradistinction to the time of the preexilic “former prophets” (7:7). Life in Judah was not “as usual.” All in all, even if we assume that there is a myth of the empty land in the biblical text, why not consider the possibility that the myth was created because of the heavy destruction of the land of Judah proper and its historical lamentable reality during the exilic period. Why not a literary

trope, a hyperbole, instead of a theological and ideological idea of emptiness and purifying of the land as a prerequisite for restoration, or a legitimization for a takeover of the non-exiles’ lands by the returned exiles?
Archaeological Finds in Judah from the Exilic Period
Does archaeology buttress the presumption that the large majority of the inhabitants of Judah proper remained in the land? I shall make this section short, because the reader can find essays in the present volume by competent archaeologists relating to this issue, with their highly contested interpretation (since the archaeological data can be interpreted in more than one way). Note that many years ago it was already suggested by the so-called “traditional scholars” with their “antiquated” and “preposterous views” (Barstad 1996: 19, 42, 80)—but based on analysis of the biblical texts—that the Babylonians did not devastate the northern part of the kingdom of Judah, that is, the territorial area of Benjamin (Malamat 1950: 226–27), where towns such as Bethel, Tell el-Fûl (Gibeah), Tell en-Naßbeh (Mizpah), Gibeon (el-Jîb), Mozah (in Benjamin, Josh 18:26) and Anathoth are located. The archaeological evidence clearly supports the biblical evidence. On the other hand, important cities in Judah proper and many towns and villages suffered violent destruction (Shiloh 1989: 102; Vanderhooft 1999: 106–10; Stern 2000). The archaeology of Neo-Babylonian Judah is the archaeology of destruction, reflecting the “fury of Babylon” (Stager 1996). Second Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel mention the destruction of Jerusalem and the cities of Judah (Isa 44:26; 51:3; 52:2, 9; Jer 33:10; 51:24; Ezek 24:21; 33:24). The Babylonians spared the area of Benjamin. This is why many Judeans fled to Benjamin, and perhaps to the province of Samaria, including privileged families such as Gedaliah and Yaazaniah, priests, and many vinedressers, as we learn from the wine production in Gibeon and Mozah. Gedaliah settled in Mizpah and did not stay in Jerusalem or Hebron or Bethlehem. The eighty mourning men from the north tried to come with offerings to the ruined Temple in Jerusalem but were persuaded by Ishmael that there was no point in going to the ruined city; better they go to the new center at Mizpah (Jer 41:5–7). The trauma of the fall of Jerusalem and its destruction are reflected in the symbolic actions of Ezekiel (Smith-Christopher 1997: 32). It is unacceptable to look for remains (including very few seal impressions) and survivals (Barstad 1996: 51, 55) of an occupation in Jerusalem or

questionable caves at Ketef Hinnom (Barkay 1994),10 or Ein-gedi, Jericho, and a few poor villages around Bethlehem (Lipschits 1999: 47376; Stern 2000 for the archaeological and epigraphic remains) in order to substantiate a hypothesis that the large majority of the inhabitants remained in Judah, “where life went on after 586 b.c.e. pretty much in the same way as it did before the arrival of Nebuchadnezzar’s armies” (Barstad 1996: 79). One really should speak about “the Babylonian gap” in Judah (Vanderhooft 1999: 206; Stern 2000) in line with Ezekiel (33:24) and Nehemiah (1:3; 7:4). The situation in Benjamin (or Transjordan) could not be analogous in any way to the situation in Judah proper (contra Barstad 1996 and Lipschits 1999). We are dealing with two completely different situations and circumstances.
What Actually Happened in Judah during the Exilic Period?
Here are some observations and conclusions in tandem with the awareness that it is impossible to reconstruct past history exactly “as it actually happened.” The paucity of literary, epigraphic, and archaeological data concerning civil, military, or ecclesiastical matters during the exilic period in Judah proper is of significance, in contradistinction to the situations in preexilic and postexilic Judah (Hoglund 1991; Vanderhooft 1999: 104–14; Stern 2000). Plenty of epigraphic material from the preexilic and postexilic periods was in fact discovered in Judah. There is next to nothing from the exilic period, a real “dark age” (Vanderhooft 1999: 106), except (not by chance) inscriptions from the area of Benjamin (Gibeon, Mozah), which survived the Babylonian conquest. Symbolically, a Neo-Babylonian inscription was found in Tell en-Naßbeh, and epigraphic material about Judeans came from Babylonia concerning Jehoiachin and other exiles (Oded 1995). The Babylonians caused havoc and devastation (Jer 4:23–27; 44; 51:34; Hab 1:6, 9, 17; 2:8, 17). Only a relatively small number of towns and villages survived the
10. The family burial caves have been dated to the seventh century and continued to be used during the sixth century b.c.e. In light of the belief that it was a matter of honor to be buried ‘in his city’(wry[b, 1 Sam 28:3) and with his “fathers” (e.g., Gen 49:29; Judg 2:9–10; 2 Sam 17:23; 1 Kgs 14:31), it is plausible that the buried people had previously fled from Jerusalem (see Jer 37:12) and found refuge in one of the cities north of Jerusalem (such as Tell el-Fûl). After their death they were buried in the city where they had been born. If this was the case, it is not by chance that the caves (and vessels) “are similar to the Iron IIC ones found at Tell el-Fûl.” See Barkay, Qadmoniyot 17 (1985) 104; Lipschits 1999: 474.

traumatic events. In Jer 42:2 we read, “for there are only a few of us left out of many.” The destruction of big cities and fortresses, the elimination of the political entity that had existed for more than four centuries, the deportations of the civil, military, and religious leaders, together with a multitude of craftsmen—all this indicates that life could not have continued “in the same way.” From ≈rah tld (‘poorest of the land’, for example, “vinedressers” and “ploughmen”) and from several small settlements, “Torah” and the “word of the Lord” (that is, cultural activities) cannot go forth; they can do so only from urban and well-developed centers (see Isa 2:3). It is particularly indicative that we hear about the Province of Yehud during the Persian period (Grabbe 1992: 27–145; Carter 1999; Williamson 1999b for discussion and bibliography), but we do not have ample information or concrete evidence that the Babylonians turned Judah into a province (contra Lipschits 1999). The first governor (hjp) known from the extant sources is Sheshbazzar (Williamson 1999b: 246–48). The suggestion that during the exilic period (586–538 b.c.e.) Judah was under the authority of Samaria’s governor is much more plausible (Weinberg 2000, and the bibliography there).11 We hear about the Assyrians’ rebuilding of Samaria and other towns and the bringing of deportees to live there, but not about the Babylonians’ rebuilding of Jerusalem or any other town (Stern 2000). This is probably because the objectives of the Babylonian Empire differed from those of the Assyrian (Vanderhooft 1999: 4, 61–62, 82–83). Gedaliah was appointed over the remnant in the towns (not “land”) of Judah (Jer 40:5) and as a representative for them before the Babylonian authorities—and probably not as a governor of a presumed Babylonian province of Yehud (Vanderhooft 1999: 105). It was already suggested that the distribution of the stamp impressions of Mosah “marks the approximate limits of the territory administered by Gedaliah . . . corresponds roughly with the area of the tribe of Benjamin” (Zorn 1994: 183). Is it just by chance that we hear nothing about priests, poets, and prophets (see Ps 74:9) acting in Judah during the exilic period, but only in the Babylonian exile (Jer 29:5) and later on in Judah (Neh 6:14)? Haggai and Zechariah started to prophesy only after the return but
11. Williamson (1999b: 254) concludes that, “unless further texts are discovered, such possibilities are likely to remain in the realm of tantalizing speculation.” The extreme difference in estimating the population of the province of Judah during the Persian period between Weinberg (200,000) and Carter (13,000–21,000) demonstrates the degree of obscurity (but see Lipshits’s paper, pp. 323–376).

may have been born in Babylonia. Barstad devoted a concise monograph to the question of “the home of Second Isaiah” (Barstad 1997). His tentative conclusion on the last page was: “In fact, we can probably claim a Palestinian setting as little as we can claim a Babylonian one. In the meantime we shall simply have to live with the possible assumption that the text in question originated on Palestinian soil” (1997: 93). It would be equally plausible, in fact far more plausible (because of linguistic and stylistic similarities between Akkadian literature and Isaiah 40–55), to say that in the meantime we shall simply have to live with the probability that the text in question originated on Babylonian soil (Vanderhooft 1999: 169–72). Jerusalem faded into darkness throughout the exilic period (see 2 Kgs 21:13), and it was only with the return from exile that the city rose from oblivion and gradually regained its prominence (Geva 1994: 7–9; Carter 1999: 134–35; Stern 2000: 46; Weinberg 2000: 308–9). It is only right that the mythographers answer the following questions. Why did Cyrus grant permission to the returned exiles to build the Temple in Jerusalem after 50 years (two generations), including authorization of a governorship of the province of Yehud (Sheshbazzar), and did not grant permission to the presumed existing leaders of the hypothetical large majority in Judah with assumed institutions, priests, and prophets (unless we consider the edict a myth too)?12 Would it not have raised resistance and incited rebellion among the indigenous Judean “large majority”? There is no political wisdom in empowering a (foreign?) minority from outside to rule over a local, well-developed (materially and culturally) native majority. If only a few had been deported, and life in Judah continued as before 586, why did the exilic attitudes of a very small minority prevail in the biblical literature (Williamson 1999a: 118)? How could the returned minority force its version of Judaism (“the Babylonian ideology,” Carroll 1992b: 574) on the presumed well-organized majority, with their firmly founded and continuous “Palestinian” religious, economic, and cultural activities? One should expect the opposite development, even according to Thompson (1996: 195). Can we claim that a few returnees burned or silenced all of the religious and nonreligious literature, to the last letter (except possibly
12. My assumption is that the biblical version of the Edict of Cyrus is not an outright invention but a late Jewish, hidden polemic against the Samaritans, based on an original decree of Cyrus to the Judean exiles in 538 b.c.e.

Lamentations), of the “large majority” left in Judah with their “functioning state, with many of its different political institutions still intact”(Barstad 1997: 86)? In their fantasy the mythographers write about a “chauvinistic point of view” (Carroll 1998: 69), “social oppression” and “an ideology of occupation and control” (Carroll 1992a: 83), a “repressive elite” and “ideological imperialism” (Davies, 1997: 114–15), “Talibanism” (Thompson 1999: 199) and “Leninism” (Carroll 1992a: 89). This tendency to use exaggerated and pejorative phrases is telling. Moreover, if only the upper classes from Jerusalem and the people who owned land in Judah returned to Judah, following the decree by Cyrus in 538 b.c.e. (Barstad 1996: 75–76), why fabricate a myth of the empty land? Since the Babylonians did not practice bidirectional deportation, there was no shortage of cultivatable plots of land in Judah, so why invent a myth of empty land? In Ezra it is stressed that the exiles “returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone unto his town” (2:1)nothing about possessing the lands of “the other people.” According to Hoglund, the presumption of a protracted class struggle between exiles and nonexiles over land rights does not fit the evidence (Hoglund 1991: 59–60). At the same time, one should not exclude the possibility that a certain degree of tension arose between the returnees and those who remained in Judah during the exile. How may one assume (for example, Thompson 1996: 214), on the one hand, a continuity in the religious and social institutions in Judah and a mythical distinction between preexilic and postexilic Judah, and on the other hand, argue for a complete discontinuity between the “old Israel” of the tenth through sixth centuries b.c.e. and the “new Israel” (that is, Jews/Judaism) of the Persian/Hellenistic Period?
Conclusion
In conclusion, the mythographers13 have failed to present real, clear, unequivocal documentary evidence to substantiate the claim concerning “a society where life went on after 586 b.c. pretty much in the same way as it did before the arrival of Nabuchadnezzar’s armies.” Although they cannot prove it, for them it is a fact to be invented. Indications and remains (Barstad 1996: 78) based on dubious interpretation are not evidence or proof. The observations that I have presented above allow us

Where Is the “Myth of the Empty Land” To Be Found? 71
to conclude that “The myth of the Empty Land” is not only unproved but also unnecessary. There is no point to inventing a myth of the empty land because, from the biblical writers’ point of view, the exiles returned to their home and repossessed their property. Even if we agreed with Davies and Thompson (which I do not) that we are dealing with non-Judean deportees transferred to Judah from various conquered countries by the Persians, there would be no need to invent a myth of the empty land in order to legitimate their very existence in Judah, because “ultimately, the land was the empire’s, and could be possessed or dispossessed at imperial whim” (Hoglund 1991: 59). The very fact of being deported and settled by the great king, the king of kings, constitutes the needed legitimating. Compare the words of the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin, who asserted that Esarhaddon, king of Assyria and Asnapar aryqyw abr (more than eight generations earlier), deported them (that is, their forefathers) to Palestine (Ezra 4:2, 10).14 All the lines of evidence converge to the conclusion that Judah was not an empty land, a tabula rasa, during the exilic period. Nevertheless, the population was very small (Stern 2000: 51). Continuity yes, but with a marked decline in quality and very limited in quantity. Judah proper was a land with no state or capital, no leader or elders (except in Babylonia), no organized community with political, social, and religious institutions, no priests or prophets to consult (except in exile: see, for example, Jer 29:15; Ezek 33:33), no significant economic activities or trade (except in Benjamin), no cultural or literary activities (except in exile). A significant gap existed in the history of Judah during the exilic period. Concerning history versus myth, the point to grasp is that Judaism is a religion of historical memory, not a religion of inventing myths.

Periodization:
Between History and Ideology
The Neo-Babylonian Period in Biblical Historiography
Sara Japhet
Hebrew University of Jerusalem
While contemporary students of history continue to debate the objective justification of historical periodization (Croce 1921: 112–16), and while the concepts of continuity and change are constantly being confronted as two opposing dimensions of the historical process (Ritter 1985), there seems to be no doubt that “to think history is to divide it into periods” (Croce 1921: 112) and that periodization “is a basic part of the process of historical understanding” (Morris 1997: 96) and has always been “a tool for the reconstruction of the past” (Golden and Toohey 1997: 93). It is thus a major facet of historiography,1 one of the ways the historian has for expressing his or her view of history. Within the historical work, periodization is often expressed by the structure of the work and its division into chapters, and thus its significance for the historian, and consequently for those who study his work, lies in its being expressed indirectly, embedded in the literary format of his work. When studying the history of any period—in our case, the history of ancient Israel—we encounter the problem of periodization on two different planes. The first plane is that of modern history-writing, since historians have different views regarding the dividing lines between the time-blocks (Morris 1997: 96). How is the periodization of the history of ancient Israel to be defined? Where does Israel’s history begin? Where does it end? How should the internal time divisions be drawn and defined?2 The other plane on which the issue of periodization

should be attended to is that of the biblical sources themselves, particularly the historiographical texts. Since the periodization of biblical historiography is expressed and indicated, among other things, by the scope of the biblical works, a major facet of the problem is the preliminary literary decision regarding this scope. One may ask, for example, whether the first book of Scripture is a Pentateuch (Genesis to Deuteronomy) or a Hexateuch (Genesis to Joshua), the decision having extensive implications on every aspect of the work, including the definition of its topic: if a Pentateuch, it ends with the death of Moses at the eve of the conquest, and the topic of the work may be defined as “the Lord’s covenant with Israel”; if a Hexateuch, the work ends with the conclusion of the conquest, and its topic may be defined as “promise and fulfillment.”3 The attention of the present paper is confined to the second plane alone, to the periodization as expressed by biblical history. The period under consideration is not as important as “beginnings” or “endings” but, because it is quite well documented, it is of great methodological import. I will examine the Neo-Babylonian period from the perspective of periodization, as expressed by four biblical works: the book of Kings, Ezra–Nehemiah, Chronicles, and 1 Esdras, in this order.4
The Book of Kings
The book of Kings is the first among the historical books to introduce the reader to the “Neo-Babylonian” period and, more specifically, to the topic of our discussion. This period, the definition of which belongs to the modern historian, is presented in the last section of the book, 2 Kgs 24:18–20; 25:1–30. The system of periodization employed by the book of Kings is well known: the Deuteronomist (or: whoever wrote this book) views history as a succession of reigns of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel “synchronically,” as long as Northern Israel existed as a political entity, and
3. On the predominance of “Hexateuch” in biblical studies of the nineteenth century, see Römer and de Pury 2000: 39–41. 4. The definition of the works and their order has been determined by their literary nature as independent works, and by the assumed order of composition. On these problems, see further below, and see Japhet 1993: 3–5; 2000: 146–47.
monarchy? Each of these views has found expression in some modern “history of ancient Israel.” The “end” of the biblical period, less debated, is also placed at different points: the end of the monarchic period, the end of the Persian rule, the establishment of the Hasmonean reign, the appearance of Jesus, and the destruction of the Second Temple are the common candidates.

of Judah alone thereafter. Each reign is well defined: literarily as a unit of the story, by means of what we call “the deuteronomistic framework”; chronologically, as the length of each reign is specified; and synchronically, in the constant explicit chronological reference to the other kingdom (Eissfeldt 1965: 282–85). According to this method of periodization, the book should have ended with the reign of Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, that is 2 Kgs 25:21. This, however, is not the case. The narrative continues, and thus the last section of the book is composed of three parts: (a) 24:18–25:21: the reign of Zedekiah; (b) 25:22–26: the governorship of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam; (c) 25:27–30: the rehabilitation of Jehoiachin in the 37th year of his reign. While the most extensive part of the chapter is indeed dedicated to the destruction of Judah and the tragic fate of Zedekiah, this is not the conclusion of the narrative. The destruction itself, no matter how severe the event may have been, is not presented as the end. From the point of view of historical periodization—which might very well reflect the actual historical circumstances—there is no period after the last line wtmda l[m hdwhy lgyw (‘and Israel was exiled from its land’). In one continuous flow and in the same tone and style, the story moves on to describe two additional matters: the short history of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, and the rehabilitation of Jehoiachin. Moreover, the conclusion of this narrative evokes no sense of closure; the reader feels that the author has simply stopped at the point in history in which he found himself at the time of writing.5 According to the book of Kings, then, there is really no defined “Neo-Babylonian period” (just as there is no “Assyrian period”). The continuous flow of events in the kingdom of Judah includes the destruction of Jerusalem, the execution of its king, and the exile of part of its population, but the story goes on and returns to Jehoiachin and his rehabilitation. At this point, however, some literary-critical remarks regarding this unit are indicated because they may have important implications for the picture I have just drawn. The historical periodization and its underlying historical understanding presented above are expressed by the canonical form of the book of Kings, the originality and authenticity of which have been variously challenged. Many recent studies of
5. This is certainly the reason that this date has traditionally served as a starting point for the dating of the book. See, among others, Noth 1943. The references are to the English translation: Noth 1981: 12; see also Gray 1964: 8.

Kings have reached the conclusion that the book is the work of several authors, all of them “deuteronomistic.” According to the “American School,” the first author (Dtr I) composed the basic deuteronomistic work in the time of Josiah, from the optimistic perspective of this period, while the second (Dtr II) completed the work after the exile (Cross 1973).6 According to the “German School,” all of the three redactional stages by which the book came into being were postexilic (Dietrich 1972; Römer and de Pury 2000: 67–72). According to this literary analysis, the historical periodization of the Neo-Babylonian period as presented above would reflect more specifically the views of one redactional deuteronomistic stage rather than “the” deuteronomistic work as a whole. Of particular interest in this matter is the position of M. Noth, which exerted so much influence on biblical scholarship.7 While Noth regards the last section of Kings to be written by the Deuteronomist himself, either on the basis of Baruch’s narrative or of “his own knowledge” (Noth 1981: 74), he nevertheless regards the concluding words of v. 21, “and Judah was exiled from its land,” as the actual end of the work, the purpose of which was to explain the destruction of Jerusalem as “the end of history,” “seeing the fall of Jerusalem, not unjustly, as the final act in a long historical drama” (Noth 1981: 79).8 However we conceive of the literary origin of the last section of Kings—whether the work of “the” Deuteronomist, the work of one redactional layer, or the work of some editor responsible for the final “canonical form”—the book of Kings now includes some important data about the Neo-Babylonian period: the settling down of “the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and ploughmen” (2 Kgs 25:12), the appointment of Gedaliah as governor and his installment in Mizpah (vv. 2223), the names of some of the commanders who joined him and stayed with him (v. 23), Gedaliah’s assassination by a group of soldiers, headed by a member of the royal family (v. 25), the flight of many to Egypt (v. 26), and finally, in Babylon, the rehabilitation of Jehoiachin
6. Cross has been followed by many, for example, Nelson 1981; see Römer and de Pury 2000: 63–67. 7. Noth 1943. On the response to Noth’s views, in acceptance, rejection, or modification, see the various essays in McKenzie and Graham 1994; Römer and de Pury 2000: 44141, and the other relevant articles in the same volume. 8. Noth’s attitude (one may even say, preconception) is very well expressed by the correlation that he finds between his own view and that of the Deuteronomist: “what the historian looking back can determine about the time of Dtr. as a period of decisive change, agrees with what Dtr. quite rightly understood . . .” (Noth 1981: 79).



Periodization: Between History and Ideology 79
(vv. 27–30). Nevertheless, for the book of Kings, there is no “Babylonian period”; it is not marked by a literary framework, has no chronological definition, and there is no marked break in the flow of the historical continuity.
The Book of Ezra–Nehemiah
The book of Ezra–Nehemiah presents an entirely different approach to the periodization of history, which I discussed elsewhere and will not repeat here (Japhet 1994). I will limit my observations to its view of the period under discussion, the Babylonian period. (a) Ezra–Nehemiah opens with the edict of Cyrus and its date: “In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia” (Ezra 1:1). The beginning of the story is thus placed in a politically-determined framework that modern historians define as “the Persian Period.” While the term may be modern, the historical conception underlying it was expressed already in Ezra–Nehemiah. [To be sure, literary-critical considerations may be brought to bear also at this point. Scholars who believe in the existence of a “Chronistic History,” in which Ezra–Nehemiah was originally a direct continuation of Chronicles, will see the present beginning of Ezra–Nehemiah as the accidental result of a secondary intervention that separated this last part of the work from the main body, now in Chronicles. This question has been extensively dealt with in recent scholarship (among others, Japhet 1968; 1991b; Williamson 1977: 1–70; Steins 1995: 49–82; Kelly 1996: 14–26), and I will just state my view on the matter. I regard Ezra–Nehemiah as a separate literary work, earlier than Chronicles and composed by a different author. The distinctive view of this book (even when regarded as “merely” canonical) should be examined in its own right.] (b) The historical significance of the new political scene is highlighted in the edict of Cyrus, quoted in the first verses of the book.9 In the first year of his reign, Cyrus authorizes the Jews in Babylon to take three steps: (1) to build the Temple in Jerusalem; (2) to return to Jerusalem for this purpose; and (3) to transfer money and valuables from Babylon to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:3–4). This is the chronological and
9. The authenticity of this document has been called into question by many scholars (see the summary and an extensive bibliography in Williamson 1985: 3, 6–7), but this problem is irrelevant for the purpose of our discussion. As a matter of fact, the more inauthentic the document, the better it expresses the position of the book’s author.



80 Sara Japhet
historical starting-point for the following narrative, which proceeds to describe in detail how these aims were accomplished (Ezra 1–6). This starting point refers back, with no intermittance, to the destruction of the Temple, the direct connection being articulated in Cyrus’s declaration: “The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah” (Ezra 1:2). This connection is expressed further by the reference to the prophecy of Jeremiah, “that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished” (Ezra 1:1), illustrating the theological pattern of “prophecy and fulfillment.”10 Although the author is certainly aware of the time gap between the two extremes—the gap of 70 years being the essence of Jeremiah’s prophecy—there is no consequence in his account of this gap, either historical or theological. Historical time moves from destruction to restoration, from prophecy to fulfillment. (c) Another aspect of Cyrus’s edict is its addressees. The edict is addressed to the Jews in exile, in Babylon or Persia, who need to “return” in order to build the Temple: “whoever is among you of all his people . . . let him go up to Jerusalem . . . and build the house of the Lord” (Ezra 1:3). As has been amply demonstrated, this is very much in line with the interests of Ezra–Nehemiah, whose sole concerns are the “returnees,” the “returned exiles,” or simply “the exile” (Japhet 1983). The book of Ezra–Nehemiah does not acknowledge the existence of a Jewish or Israelite community in the land of Israel other than the returned exiles, and accordingly, views the inhabitants of the land as either “returnees” or foreigners, “peoples of the land.” To be sure, the modern historian does not accept this view as an authentic reflection of the historical circumstances, but this is nevertheless the view of EzraNehemiah, the influence of which on biblical historians for many years cannot be overestimated.11
10. I follow the common interpretation of this statement as an allusion to Jeremiah’s prophecy about the 70 years of Babylonian rule (Jer 25:11–12; 29:10); I do not think that “Isaiah” should be restored here or that the reference is to Jeremiah 51. See Williamson 1985: 9–10. 11. This is now strongly refuted by the commonly used term “the myth of the empty land” (see also in this volume, pp. 3–20). The material incorporated into Ezra–Nehemiah sometimes seems to reflect a different historical reality: a second version of Cyrus’s edict (Ezra 6:3–5) that does not contain permission to return and originally seems to have been addressed to people living in the land; the reference to the existence of an altar in Jerusalem prior to the building of the Temple, the building of which is attributed to the returnees, may actually be a description of earlier times (see Japhet 1991a: 224–28); and
spread is 6 points short



Periodization: Between History and Ideology 81
The conjunction of the historical events on the one hand and the specific periodization on the other results in an interesting historical picture. According to Ezra–Nehemiah the period of Babylonian rule in the land had no concrete historical realization. The author knows that years have passed, but the new beginning “in the first year of Cyrus” “hangs in the air” and is connected neither to the Babylonian period that preceded it nor, for that matter, to anything else. When is this “first year” to be placed?12 Moreover, while the contents of the opening of Ezra–Nehemiah refer back to the destruction of the Temple, that is, to Jerusalem, the geographical milieu of the edict is Babylon; the decree is addressed to the exiles, with complete discontinuity of geographical domain. The history of Judah is seen from the perspective of those who left it and are now about to return. From whatever perspective we look at this matter, for the book of Ezra–Nehemiah the Neo-Babylonian period in the land of Israel is nonexistent. It is a historical vacuum. A comparison with what we have observed in the book of Kings may further elucidate this statement. As we have seen, the Babylonian period does exist as a historical reality in the book of Kings: it is the scene of several events and is represented by the continuity of the house of David, through the rehabilitation of Jehoiachim. True, this period is not marked in Kings as a defined historical period, nor is it assigned a specific setting in the historical periodization (which is organized by the principle of the Kings’ reigns); yet this span of time does have historical concreteness, in the continuation of settlement and in the occurrence of several events. In Ezra–Nehemiah, by contrast, the Babylonian rule in Judah does not exist as a historical reality. There is a direct transition from the destruction of the Temple to its restoration, from Jeremiah’s prophecy to its fulfillment. With the move of the historical arena from Judah to the Judean exile in Babylon, there is also a move in the line of continuity: from the destruction in Judah to the exile in Babylon, and then through the return to Judah to the beginning of restoration in the first
12. We may compare this beginning to the opening of Joshua: “after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua” (Josh 1:1); or to the beginning of Judges: “after the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the Lord” (Judg 1:1).
Nehemiah’s description of the inhabitants of Jerusalem as “the survivors there in the province who escaped exile” (Neh 1:3), a term that may refer to those who were not exiled; and so on. All these, however, are now absorbed into the story of Ezra–Nehemiah, the subject of which is “the returned exiles.”

year of Cyrus.13 Cyrus constitutes a new beginning, an antithesis to the destruction of the Temple, historically and theologically.14
The Book of Chronicles
Yet another historical understanding is reflected in Chronicles. The overall periodization of Chronicles is clear-cut. The book ends with the edict of Cyrus, and the long history from Adam to Cyrus is structured in three eras: (a) beginnings: from Adam to David (1 Chronicles 1–9); (b) David and Solomon (1 Chronicles 10–2 Chronicles 9); (c) the kings of Judah (2 Chronicles 10–36). This tripartite periodization is expressed neither in literal definitions nor in chronological statements but, rather, through the literary style and forms, the underlying theology, and the historical presuppositions (Japhet 1993: 8–13). While employing the book of Kings as his main literary source for the third section of the narrative, the Chronicler differs from his source in the details of the account, in the historical and theological presuppositions, and also in the periodization system he adopts. In his account of the reign of Zedekiah (2 Chr 36:11–21), the Chronicler presents the destruction of Jerusalem as its sole concern, described after the introduction of Zedekiah: “Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men . . . , and all the vessels . . . and the treasures . . . he brought to Babylon. And they burned the house of God. . . . He took into exile in Babylon those who had escaped the sword” (2 Chr 36:17–20a). This statement is followed by a transition to the Persian period in two stages: (1) “and they became servants to him and to his sons until the establishment of the kingdom of Persia, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths . . . to fulfill seventy years” (vv. 20b–21); (2) “now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia . . .” (v. 22).
13. This specific line of continuity is expressed in a different way in the introduction to the list of returnees, in Ezra 2:1 (= Neh 7:6). The returned exiles are identified as those who were exiled by Nebuchadnezzar and are now coming back, “each to his own town.” This highly improbable identification and equally improbable resettlement, “each in his own town,” underline the line of continuity that goes through those who were exiled, sojourned in Babylon, and are to return and reestablish the community. This line of continuity—through return and not through existence in the land—is also expressed by the motif of the Temple’s vessels that return with the exiles (as shown by Ackroyd 1987). 14. One wonders whether this is not the reason for Cyrus’s title in this verse, “The King of Persia,” rather than his official title, “King of Babylon”—a problem that attracted much attention in biblical scholarship (see, e.g., Williamson 1985: 9).



Periodization: Between History and Ideology 83
This mode of historical transition is the overt expression of the underlying system of periodization, which divides the relevant time span into three time units: the destruction in the time of Zedekiah; the Babylonian rule (vv. 20–21); and the Persian period, beginning with Cyrus (vv. 22–23). These are three consecutive historical periods, defined in political terms by the identity of the political rulers of the land of Judah: the house of David represented by Zedekiah, the kings of the Chaldeans (“he and his sons”), and the Persian kingdom. The dominant historical principle is that of change within a framework of continuity, of time and place; the underlying principle of periodization is the political regime, by which the time units are determined. So different from the view of Ezra–Nehemiah, chronological continuity and unity of the geographical arena provide the framework for political change. The picture portrayed by Chronicles also differs from that of Kings. The Chronicler provides no data regarding the Babylonian period itself and omits the notes about the settlement of the remaining farmers in the land of Judah and the governorship of Gedaliah. The elimination of all reference to these matters creates the sense that life in the land of Judah after the destruction continued unchanged, a corollary of the Chronicler’s view that the destruction affected Jerusalem alone.15 The historical understanding thus presented is unique: while the period of the Babylonian rule receives for the first time a defined place in the periodization system, the time span is not filled by any historical contents. Life in Judah continued as before, while for Jerusalem it was a “sabbath.” As already mentioned, Chronicles concludes his narrative with the opening words of the edict of Cyrus, taken from the book of Ezra.16 Regarding this conclusion two points should be emphasized. (a) The Chronicler’s decision about how and where to conclude his work, just like his decision about where to begin it, is of the utmost significance. While the author of Kings seems simply to have concluded his account upon arriving at his own “present,” the Chronicler’s conclusion is an expression of a specific historical outlook. Having written his book
15. On the limitation of the destruction to Jerusalem and to this period alone, and its historical and theological presuppositions and consequences, see Japhet 1989: 367–74. 16. Here again, some scholars would regard the last paragraphs of Chronicles as inauthentic, secondary accretions, thereby altering significantly the book’s message and standing in danger of walking in a vicious circle. In justification of Williamson’s position, I may say that his arguments seem to be literary: his view that Ezra–Nehemiah was composed after Chronicles precludes the possibility of authentic borrowing in Chronicles from Ezra–Nehemiah. See also Williamson 1982: 419; 1983: 29–30; Steins 1995: 63–67.



84 Sara Japhet
many generations after the destruction, he could have continued and elaborated the story to include much more information regarding later periods.17 His decision to conclude the account at this point and with this specific text was certainly deliberate. (b) The Chronicler quotes only the first part of the edict—that is, God’s charge to Cyrus to build the Temple; the concluding words, “whoever is among you of all his people, may the Lord his God be with him. Let him go up,” become in this context an expression of general blessing and encouragement. We may grasp the full meaning of the Chronicler’s conclusion by the double mention of Jeremiah in this section. The first reference to Jeremiah (v. 21) is related to the “land’s rest”: the 70 years in which the land lies desolate should compensate for its lost sabbaths,18 interpreting the length of the Babylonian rule as the fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prophecy of destruction. The second reference to Jeremiah is related to the prophecy of salvation, for the people and the land, but this prophecy has not yet been fulfilled and is still a matter for the future. In Chronicles, Cyrus’s edict is not followed by any account of the period of restoration because the realization of this prophecy—release from servitude, independence and restoration—is yet to come. For the Chronicler, “restoration” is not a matter of the past, like the history he recounted, but a matter of the future, the realization of which is still to be expected. In its general philosophy of history, then, the book of Chronicles is more future oriented than any other piece of biblical historiography. The past has laid the foundation for the future, but this is still to come.19
The Book of 1 Esdras
Although the canonical status of 1 Esdras is problematic,20 it is no doubt a continuation of biblical historiography, and for the matter under consideration a very apt place to conclude our discussion.
17. This is true even for scholars who regard the book’s date as relatively early (that is, at the end of the sixth century b.c.e.) and certainly for those who regard its date as much later, as is the more common view (see Kalimi 1993). 18. The Chronicler’s interpretation of Jer 25:11–13 is combined with Lev 26:43, as has been observed by many commentators. See, for example, Curtis and Madsen 1910: 524. 19. One of the debates regarding the Chronicler’s outlook revolves around the question of “eschatology”: should this view of Chronicles be defined as “eschatological”? See recently Kelly 1996: 135–85. It seems that much of this debate lies in the realm of definition and terminology: if the term eschatology is used in its authentic, strict meaning, it cannot be applied to the Chronicler’s view. 20. It was not included in the Hebrew Bible, and even in the Greek Bible its status is not unequivocal. See Japhet 2001: 751.

1 Esdras is a reworked form of two earlier biblical works, Chronicles and Ezra–Nehemiah. Its first chapter is taken from 2 Chronicles 35–36, with very light changes, and what follows is taken from Ezra–Nehemiah, with some changes in order and detail. At a certain point in the narrative the author introduces the story of the three guards (I Esd 3:15:2), the origin of which is yet unknown. In format and method the book is most similar to Chronicles: it presents a new description of a period that has already been recounted, based primarily on the reworking of extant materials (Talshir 1999). The narrative of 1 Esdras begins with Josiah’s Passover and proceeds to recount the events of the last kings of Judah, including the destruction of Jerusalem, according to its version in 2 Chronicles 36. Immediately thereafter the author goes on to Ezra 1 and continues the story exactly where the Chronicler had stopped; he then attaches the whole of Ezra and one chapter of Nehemiah (Neh 8:1–12).21 What are the underlying historical presuppositions of this account, and what is its significance for the issue of periodization? It seems that the most important concept underlying the book’s plan is continuity: the history of Israel from the end of the Judaic kingdom to the period of restoration is presented as one continuum. On this unbroken time-line, the destruction of the temple loses much of its prominence and is not seen as a real turning point; history existed before it—and afterward. From the perspective of periodization, although the Babylonian period does exist as a unit (since 2 Chr 36:20–21 is quoted verbatim in 1 Esd 1:54–55), the book’s attitude toward this period differs both from that of Ezra–Nehemiah and from that of Chronicles. As we observed above, the book of Ezra–Nehemiah opens with the Persian period and refers back to the end of the kingdom of Judah through its contents: the rebuilding of the destroyed Temple. Cyrus’s edict in Ezra 1 is thus not a continuation of the events of the Babylonian period as recorded in 2 Kgs 25:22–30 but a new beginning—in time, in place, and in the protagonists of the story—that is then continued by the detailed account
21. Here again, the literary-critical question is of significance. This continuation has been regarded by many scholars as reflecting the “original” chronistic work, although the precise process of composition has been variously presented (compare, for example, the views of Cross [1975] and Pohlmann [1970]. My own conclusion, in accord with other scholars [see Williamson 1996], is that it is an independent work, probably written in the second century b.c.e. See Japhet 2001: 751–52. The abundance of works defined as a “rewritten Bible” in the library of Qumran adds one more argument to this view (Williamson 1996: 215–16).



86 Sara Japhet
of the restoration. The Chronicler also ignored the actual history of the Babylonian period but did create a time unit for it. The edict of Cyrus in 2 Chr 36:22–23 is indeed connected to the destruction of Jerusalem but is seen as the beginning of a future, which is still to be realized. By joining the account of the restoration to the story of Chronicles, 1 Esdras places the edict of Cyrus as one stage in a continuous historical line. This simple act creates a bridge between the two periods and reduces the implication of the destruction to the point of insignificance. In principle, perhaps, it may be compared to the position expressed by the book of Kings, but it is viewed from a much later period and with a much broader perspective. It is interesting to note that, although the Babylonian period functions in 1 Esdras as a bridge, there is no interest in this period for its own sake. Following Chronicles, the Babylonian period is alloted a time unit in the chronological sequence, but 1 Esdras refrains from filling the time span with any historical contents, even the data that could be found in 2 Kings 25 or in Jeremiah. Contrary to Chronicles, for 1 Esdras the period of restoration as described in Ezra–Nehemiah is the actual continuation of the history of Judah. This line of continuation is expressed in another way by the figure and role of Zerubbabel who, as the scion of David, is the central protagonist of the story (Japhet 1982–83; 1983: 218–19; 2001: 751). We may say that the goals of 1 Esdras were twofold: to present the continuity of the history of Israel through the bridge between destruction and restoration, and to grant the period of restoration the status of “fulfillment,” elevated by the central figure of Zerubbabel.
Conclusion
What, then, is the place of the Neo-Babylonian period in biblical historiography and in biblical historical thought? As a concrete historical reality, the Neo-Babylonian period exists only in the book of Kings, through the few data relating to the people who remained in the land of Israel, the fate of Gedaliah, and the rehabilitation of Jehoiachin. None of these is found in the other three works, Ezra–Nehemiah, Chronicles and 1 Esdras. Yet, in the book of Kings, and later in Ezra–Nehemiah, the Babylonian period is not defined as a period in any of the forms that such a definition may take. The Neo-Babylonian period exists as a defined time unit in the book of Chronicles: it is a period of servitude to the Babylonian kings, spanned between the reign of the Davidic kings on the one side and the Persian



Periodization: Between History and Ideology 87
period on the other, but it has a theological rather than a historical significance. It is the period of sabbath; and the restoration, the continuation of Judean history, is for the Chronicler still a matter of the future. For 1 Esdras, for whom the main object is the manifestation of continuity, the restoration is the anticipated continuation of the history of Judah. Although the Babylonian period retains its place as a time unit in the historical process (following 2 Chr 36:20–21), it has no meaning in its own right. The examination of four biblical historiographical works has brought to light four different views regarding the Neo-Babylonian period. What they all have in common is the almost total indifference to the topic of our conference, “Judah and Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period.” It seems that this period did not attract the attention of biblical historians, and the theological burden ascribed to it in Chronicles, a sabbath of the land, served perhaps to intensify its historical insignificance. Some data about this period may be found in other biblical genres, in particular contemporary prophetic and poetic literature: Jeremiah and Ezekiel at the one end; Lamentations, Haggai, and perhaps Zechariah at the other end. The period is also reflected to a certain degree in the material embedded in Ezra–Nehemiah and to a lesser degree in Chronicles. The modern historian who wishes to know more about the Neo-Babylonian period and to assign to it its proper place in the history of Israel cannot be satisfied with what the biblical historians have preserved and recorded. Only after having used all the available materials from all sources, including extrabiblical and archeological, will he be able to justify, or refute, the claim of the Babylonian rule of the land of Judah to be defined as a “period” in the history of ancient Israel.

Bethel in the Neo-Babylonian Period

University of Notre Dame
Introductory Remarks about Bethel
For the history of Bethel in the Iron age, including its last phase, we have to depend almost exclusively on the biblical texts. Since Edward Robinson’s epic horse ride through Palestine in 1838, the site has been identified with, and is to a considerable extent covered by (all but four acres or sixteen dunams), the Arab village of Beitin. It lies about 16 km north of Jerusalem and 2.5 km northwest of Ai (assuming the identification of Ai with et-Tell), on a hilltop site with springs nearby, on the main north–south route from the central hill country to the Jordan Valley. It was excavated initially in 1934 by W. F. Albright assisted by Kelso, then by Kelso alone in 1954, 1957, and 1960. Unfortunately, the report of the excavation, published in 1968, provides no reliable stratigraphy and follows the still-familiar practice of extrapolating conclusions from the biblical data (Albright 1934; Kelso 1968, 1975, 1993; Dever 1971, 1997). Bethel features in the city and boundary lists of Ephraim (1 Chr 7:28) and Benjamin, the southern branch of Ephraim (Josh 18:22), and was situated on the southern boundary between Ephraim and Benjamin (Josh 16:1–2; 18:13), near the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Samaria. Its former name was Luz (Gen 28:19; Judg 1:23), but in the Josephite boundary list Luz is located west of Bethel, between Bethel and Ataroth (Josh 16:1–2). In the Benjamin boundary list the corresponding points—reading east to west—are Beth-aven, Luz, and Ataroth (Josh 18:12–13). The discrepancy can be explained as follows. As the name suggests, and as it is explicitly interpreted in Gen 28:17 (Jacob’s vision of the ramp), Bethel is a sanctuary dedicated to a local hypostasis of El (El-Beth-el) later appropriated by Yahveh.1 This
1. Alternatively, there may be an association with the deity Bêt-ael attested from the seventh century b.c.e. and named among the deities invoked as witnesses in the vassal treaty of Esarhaddon with Baal I of Tyre (ANET, 534). See Jer 48:13, where Bethel is a deity

sanctuary was situated not on the site of the city but to the east, in the direction of Ai, as we learn from Abraham’s itinerary (Gen 12:18; 13:3) and the military dispositions of Joshua.2 Once it became a dissident and heterodox center from the point of view of Jerusalemite orthodoxy, it acquired the dysphemism Bet-aawen,3 a term deemed appropriate because aawen ‘evil, mischief’ can also connote an unacceptable cult object.4 Like other originally derogatory designations, however, it became an ordinary place-name in the course of time (Josh 7:2; 18:12–13; 1 Sam 14:23). At some point, then, and under circumstances unknown to us, the sanctuary gave its name to the nearby “city” of Luz, as we see from the gloss identifying Luz with Bethel (Gen 35:6; Josh 18:13). The biblical texts provide little information about Iron Age Bethel. The conquest narratives, in which Bethel is closely associated with Ai, provide two different accounts of its capture (Josh 7:2; 8:1–29; 12:9, 16; cf. Judg 1:22–26), and during the Philistine wars there was a high place for sacrifice at Bethel frequented by nébîaîm (1 Sam 10:3; cf. 2 Kgs 2:23, 23). The name itself would suggest the existence of an ancient sanctuary, though Kelso’s archaeological arguments for its existence from MB on are not persuasive (Kelso 1968: 23). Bethel came into its own when Jeroboam made it the principal sanctuary of his kingdom, situated on its southern border, as Dan was on its northern extremity (1 Kgs 12:28–33; cf. Amos 7:13, miqdas melek, bet mamlakâ). Bethel was established deliberately as a rival to the Jerusalem Temple (1 Kgs 12:2728), with a different liturgical calendar (12:32–33), and non-Levitical priests referred to by the Historian in a derogatory fashion as kohånê habbamôt (12:31–32). We shall see that the descendants of these priests were destined to play an important role in the religious history of emergent Judaism. The animus of the Historian against Jeroboam’s cult center is apparent from the prediction of its destruction by Josiah immediately following its establishment (1 Kings 13), the fulfillment of which is duly noted (2 Kgs 23:4, 15–20).

the two kingdoms, we are not well informed. It may have changed hands more than once in the frequent wars between the two kingdoms (2 Chr 13:19 mentions one occasion during the reign of Abijah), but the important point is that it survived the Assyrian conquest (2 Kgs 17:2428). According to Kelso (1968: 37) it was destroyed in 722, but he offers no evidence in support of this assertion apart from the absence of pottery. We may therefore conclude that it continued in existence without interruption as a central place of worship, serving the remaining indigenous population and the mixed population brought in by the Assyrians.5 Josiah is reported to have desecrated the Bethel sanctuary and dismantled its cult apparatus (2 Kgs 23:4, 15, 20) but, even granted the historical reliability of the report in 2 Kings 23, the effects of Josiah’s reforming zeal would have been no more lasting here than they proved to be in Jerusalem. There is therefore no reason to doubt that Bethel continued to function down into the Neo-Babylonian period.
Bethel during the Babylonian Exile
In common with other sites in Benjaminite territory, Bethel was not destroyed during the Babylonian punitive expedition of 588–586. The archaeological evidence for the last phase of Beitin is inconclusive, but it is clear that it survived the Babylonian conquest and continued in existence until at least the mid–sixth century b.c.e.6 Bethel could have been destroyed during a phase of internal strife at the hands of the dominant Judeo-Babylonian element, or as a result of encroachment from Samaria, or in connection with one or other of the military crises of the mid– to late sixth century affecting the province (for example, the obscure events, news of which was brought to Nehemiah in Susa by Hananiah [Neh 1:1–4], or the revolt of Megabyzus, assuming this was not what Hananiah’s news was about). In the absence of both reliable archaeological data and written information, we can only speculate.
5. In addition to the deportations and relocations effected by Sargon II after the conquest of Samaria, we hear of later arrivals of foreign groups under Esarhaddon (681–669) and Ashurbanipal (668–627). (See Ezra 4:2 and 10 and the gloss at Isa 7:8b.) 6. The dating of the evidence for destruction has gradually been pushed back from the early sixth century (Albright 1934: 14) to the last decades of the same century (Kelso 1968: 11, 37, 51); Sinclair (in Kelso 1968: 75–76) puts it during the reign of either Nabonidus or Cyrus II. But, in view of the reservations noted earlier about the excavation of the site, it is still a case of caveat lector.



96 Joseph Blenkinsopp
The particular circumstance affecting Bethel at that time was its proximity to Mizpah (Tell en-Naßbeh), center of the Babylonian administration of the region. Beitin is about 6 km north of Tell en-Naßbeh on the north–south highway. The location of the old Beth-aven sanctuary is unknown, but if it was between Bethel and Ai, as the relevant biblical texts suggest, it could have been even closer to Mizpah. The archaeological data attest that the territory of Benjamin escaped retribution at the hands of the Babylonians. The evidence has often been reviewed (see, most recently, Lipschits 1999) and its interpretation in this sense widely accepted, so I may be excused from repeating it here. The same conclusion is suggested by the census of Ezra 2:1–67 = Neh 7:6–68, according to which twelve or thirteen of the twenty or so locations in which the first Judeo-Babylonian immigrants are said to have settled are in Benjamin, and only two (Bethlehem and Netophah) lie south of Jerusalem (Ezra 2:20–35 = Neh 7:25–38). This circumstance has been explained on the hypothesis that the inhabitants of the Benjaminite region surrendered at an early stage of the campaign (for example, Malamat 1950: 227; Miller and Hayes 1986: 178). This is possible, but it seems to me more likely that, like Jeremiah who was arrested during the siege of Jerusalem as a deserter, and who owned real estate in Benjamin (Jer 37:11–16; cf. 32:6–15), the inhabitants of the region belonged to the antiwar or appeasement party from the beginning of the Babylonian takeover. Whatever the explanation, after the catastrophe of 586 the center of gravity, politically, socially and, I believe, religiously, moved decisively northward from the Judean heartland to the region corresponding to the tribal territory of Benjamin. For our knowledge of the Babylonian administration of the region, we have to rely almost exclusively on the biblical texts. Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions are not forthcoming on the subject of provincial organization and administration, but this does not justify the conclusion that none existed in the Cisjordanian region.7 The relevant biblical texts are Jeremiah 40–41 and the much briefer account in 2 Kgs 25:2226, which may be an abstract of the Jeremiah text. Gedaliah (Gedalyahu), member of the influential Shaphanite family associated with the
7. As Vanderhooft (1999: 105) maintains. We have even less evidence from Persian royal inscriptions for provincial organization in the west, but the existence of a provincial system there is quite certain. In these matters, arguments e silentio are notoriously subject to correction and, moreover, as Vanderhooft notes (1999: 38–39, 91), the inscriptions of Nebuchadrezzar II do refer to kings and governors in Eber-nari and Hatti land. Wiseman (1985: 38) claimed that the appointment of Gedaliah was typical of Babylonian practice but unfortunately did not provide evidence.

antiwar party, was established as the Babylonian appointee in Mizpah, either as puppet king or governor (bel pihati),8 only to be assassinated by Ishmael, a member of the royal family, with Ammonite support. By mentioning only the seventh month (2 Kgs 25:25; Jer 41:1), the texts have left us in doubt about how soon after the fall of Jerusalem this event took place. Several scholars, most recently Lipschits (1999: 162), have argued the shorter option, a period of no more than two months rather than several years. The best and possibly the only argument in favor of this opinion rests on the pattern of dating from the siege of Jerusalem, concluding with a sequence of the fourth, fifth, and seventh months (2 Kgs 25:3, 8, 25). But the problem with this argument is precisely that the year is missing only for the date of the assassination. Moreover, two months is hardly enough to allow for the dust to settle after the destruction and mayhem of the Babylonian campaign, some administrative apparatus to be set up at Mizpah, the conspiracy to develop in Ammon (Jer 40:13–16), people to dribble back from other regions, some of them quite distant (Jer 40:7–8, 11–12), and the last harvest of the agrarian year to be gathered in (Jer 40:12). It therefore seems preferable to connect Ishmael’s terrorist act with the deportation mentioned in Jer 52:30, dated to the 23d year of Nebuchadrezzartherefore 582 b.c.e.
Bethel as a Cultic Center
The destruction of the Temple, which had served to confer religious legitimacy on the revolt of the “rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces” (Ezra 4:15), was a deliberate and demonstrative act, and we can be sure that the Babylonian generalissimo Nebuzaradan did a thorough job of it. (For the condition of the ruins, see Lam 1:4; 2:6–7, 20; Ps 74:1–7.) The leading priests were executed (2 Kgs 25:18) to discourage any further cultic activity on the site, and the altar was, in any case, corpse-contaminated and rendered ritually inaccessible. Even if the book of Lamentations was written for recital at the site of the ruined Temple, which is possible but unprovable, such lamenting would
8. The texts state simply that the Babylonian king appointed (hipqîd) him (2 Kgs 25:22–23; Jer 40:5, 7, 11; 41:2); “as governor” is a gratuitous addition of the modern versions. That Gedaliah was not of the Davidic line could account both for the reticence of the texts and the use of hipqîd rather than himlîk, as with the appointment of the Davidite Mattaniah, also known as Zedekiah (2 Kgs 24:17). The setting up of Zedekiah as a Babylonian puppet constitutes a precedent, and we can be sure that, after the latest rebellion, another member of the native dynasty would not be eligible.

no more have qualified as cultic activity than praying today at the kotel. Hence the need arose for an alternative cult site, comparable in some respects to the situation following the fall of Samaria in 722 (2 Kgs 17:27–28). In view of the political and social shift into the Benjaminite region after 586, it would be natural to think of a location for cult in connection with the administrative center of the region at Mizpah. And in fact a late narrative strand in the history of the prestate period locates cult activity, much of it characteristic of post-destruction piety, at Mizpah, where the people gathered in plenary cult assembly (lipnê Yhvh). These acts included intercessory prayer, a water-pouring ceremony, fasting, sacrifice, and preaching (Judg 20:1; 1 Sam 7:5–10; 10:1725). Furthermore, the memory of Mizpah as a ‘place of prayer’ (topos proseuches) was still alive centuries later (1 Macc 3:46). In this connection, the puzzling incident recorded in Jer 41:4–8, in which the 80 pilgrims from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, calls for comment. As they approached Mizpah on the day after the assassination of Gedaliah and his courtiers, in mourning attire and bearing grain offering and incense for ‘the house of Yhvh’ (bêt Yhvh), Ishmael went out to meet them, accompanied them into the city, and treacherously slaughtered them there. The final phrase of Jer 41:4, wéaîs loa yadao (‘and no one knew [about the assassination]’), suggests that the reason for this further deed of blood was to gain time for Ishmael by preventing the knowledge of his terrorist act from spreading, which in its turn suggests that the destination of the Northern delegation was a “house of Yhvh” in or near Mizpah rather than in Jerusalem.9 Whatever the date of the assassination of Gedaliah, whether 586 or 582, it seems incredible that the group from the North would not have known that the Jerusalem Temple was inaccessible for making offerings, even if the sacrifice was not an animal sacrifice.10 Further confirmation may be found in the fictional account of the crime of Benjaminite Gibeah and the campaign of extermination waged
9. The objection that Ishmael went out of Mizpah to meet them in order to intercept their further progress to Jerusalem is not cogent, since a glance at the concordance will show that liqraat + yßa very often means to go out to meet someone in order to escort them back to the starting point. 10. Jones (1963: 12–31) noted the absence of animals from the offerings and speculated that animal sacrifice was discontinued in the period between the destruction and reconstruction of the Jerusalem Temple, analogous to the situation at Elephantine. But we have seen that there is no evidence that sacrifice of any kind was going on after 586.



Bethel in the Neo-Babylonian Period 99
by a tribal coalition led by Judah that followed (Judges 19–21). Mizpah was the base camp for the pan-Israelite force, where decisions were made and oaths were taken, but it was also the place where the qahal (20:2) or oedâ (20:1; 21:10, 13, 16) assembled lipnê Yhvh (‘in the presence of Yhvh’, therefore in cultic assembly, 20:1). However, for the more explicitly religious acts—inquiring of God (20:18, 23, 27–28), sacrifice (20:26; 21:4), fasting (20:26), and communal lamenting (20:23, 26; 21:23)—the allies gathered at Bethel where, we are told in a brief addendum, the ark of the covenant was located under the care of Pinhas (Phineas), grandson of Aaron (20:27b–28a). Several features of this narrative can be read as reflecting the situation in the years immediately following the fall of Jerusalem: animus against Benjaminites, described in the story as aansê bénê béliyyaoal (‘a perverse lot’, 19:22; 20:13); liturgical praxis, especially fasting and communal lamentation characteristic of the post-destruction period; and the practice of deciding important issues in the plenary assembly of the qahal or oedâ, terms of frequent occurrence in post-destruction compositions (the Priestly source and Ezra–Nehemiah). It is noteworthy that presence at the assembly is required under pain of death (Judg 21:5); as in the Ezra narrative (Ezra 10:8), absenteeism from the qahal is punished with the social death of ostracism. The data at our disposal, such as they are, are no doubt capable of more than one interpretation. But it seems to me a reasonable hypothesis—and by no means a new one (see, for example, Meek 1929: 149–66; North 1954: 191–99; Judge 1956: 70–74)—that, following the elimination of the Jerusalem Temple, the old Bethel sanctuary, having survived the Assyrian conquest and the reforming zeal of Josiah, obtained a new lease on life by virtue of the favored status of the Benjamin region and the proximity of Bethel to the administrative center at Mizpah: hence, the juxtaposition of Mizpah and Bethel in Judges 20–21. Unfortunately, we have no information on Babylonian administrative arrangements at the southern end of the Syro-Palestinian corridor. If, as seems plausible, even probable, the Babylonians took over the provincial system more or less unchanged from the Assyrians (as in Alt 1964: 188), it is possible that Mizpah and the Bethel sanctuary served both Judah and the territory corresponding to the Assyrian provinces carved out of the old kingdom of Samaria. This would fit well with a visit to Mizpah by devotees from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria and would also help to explain the endemic hostility of the Samaritan population to the reestablishment of a political and religious center in Jerusalem during the early Achaemenid period.

Something should now be said about the very problematic reference to Bethel in Zech 7:1–7.11 The MT may be translated as follows:
1In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Yhvh came to Zechariah on the fourth of the ninth month, in Chislev. 2Sar-eser, Regemmelech, and his men had sent to Bethel to placate Yhvh, 3and to ask the priests who were attached to the house of Yhvh of the (heavenly) hosts and the prophets, “Should we lament and practice abstinence on the fifth month, as we have been doing for these many years?” 4Then the word of Yhvh of the (heavenly) hosts came to me: 5“Say to all the people of the land and the priests: When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and the seventh month during these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted? 6And when you eat and drink, do you not eat and drink for yourselves? 7Was not this the message that Yhvh proclaimed through the former prophets when Jerusalem was still inhabited and at peace together with the cities round about it and when the Negev and the Shepelah were still inhabited?
Since the word of Yhvh announced in v. 1 is cited only in vv. 5–7, introduced by the resumptive v. 4, the account of the mission to placate Yhvh (lé ̇allôt aet-pénê Yhvh) appears to have been inserted to provide an occasion for the statement about fasting that follows. The assumption would then be that wayyisla ̇ is pluperfect and that the mission preceded the date of the saying, that is, the 4th year of Darius I, 518 b.c.e. The most natural construction of 7:2 would be to read bêt-ael as the destination and either Sar-eser alone (since the verb is singular) or Sar-eser plus the others as subject; therefore, “Sar-eser [Regem melech and his men] had sent to Bethel. . . .” This reading has the support of the LXX, Syr., and Tg. (Vulg., implausibly, has ad domum dei for bêt-ael), even though it is unusual (though clearly not out of the question) for the destination to precede the sender after the verb sl ̇. More importantly, by reading the text in this way we avoid the problem that the Jerusalem Temple was not yet rebuilt at the time of the mission. This interpretation is admittedly uncertain, but less so than the alternative, which takes “Bethel” to stand for “the people of Bethel,” a construction that is unusual and perhaps without parallel except in poetic and symbolic personification of a city (for example, Zion as a designation for Judeans in Isaiah 49–66). A third option is to take Bethel-sar-eser as one personal name, corresponding to the Akkadian form bit-ili-sar-ußur and many other personal names formed with

bêtael. This is a stronger claimant than the one just mentioned. The name does exist,12 but Sareser tout court is also attested (2 Kgs 19:37 = Isa 37:38), and we are still left with the problem of the date. I would therefore hold out for reading the Bethel sanctuary as the destination of the delegation, sometime before 518 b.c.e. A similar request for a decision presented in the context of a prophetic saying is reported in Hag 2:10–14 and dated two years earlier than the date in Zechariah. In this instance, the issues are ritual contamination and sacrifice rather than fasting, but the outcome is a similar statement of prophetic disapproval of what is offered there (sam, Hag 2:14)—namely, a place where sacrifice of some kind was going on other than Jerusalem. Just as the reproach in Zechariah is addressed to the oam haaareß and their priests who have been engaged since the fall of Jerusalem in disingenuous acts of piety, so the religious activity, including sacrifice, of ‘this people’ (haoam hazzeh) and ‘this nation’ (haggoy hazzeh) in Haggai are declared to be compromised and ritually unacceptable. The conclusion suggests itself that those addressed in both texts are to be identified with the oam haaareß (oammê haaareß, oammê haaåraßôt), whom the dominant Judeo-Babylonian faction considered to be religiously compromised, and who opposed the political and religious restoration of Jerusalem recorded in Ezra–Nehemiah (Ezra 3:3; 4:1–4; 9:1–2, 11; 10:2, 11; Neh 10:31–32). The picture as a whole is still far from clear, but the three prophetic texts considered (Jer 41:4–5; Zech 7:1–7; Hag 2:10–14) have certain features in common: a mission or a question concerning cultic matters—lamentation, fasting, ritual purity and contamination, sacrificearising during the period from the destruction to the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple; a negative attitude to the religious practices of the indigenous population; recourse to a place of worship other than Jerusalem. They do not constitute irrefutable evidence for an alternative cult site at Bethel, but they are consistent with a situation during the Babylonian interim (586–515) when, for all or most of that time, Bethel served as the official sanctuary of Judah, Benjamin, and perhaps also the central hill country.
12. The Babylonian name belongs to a certain sirku (temple servant) whom Hyatt (1937: 387–94) and Kraeling (1953: 90) identified, improbably in my opinion, with the person mentioned in our text.

Politics and the Deuteronomistic Historian
If this reconstruction of the cultic situation during the Babylonian interim is correct, it would be of interest to know who the priests were who served at the Mizpah-Bethel sanctuary. A preliminary clue is the information that Pinhas (Phineas), son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, ministered to the ark at Bethel during the tribal war against Benjamin (Judg 20:27b–28a). This notice is generally taken to be a late addition, following in sequence the presence of Eleazar at Shiloh (Josh 14:1; 17:4; 19:51; 21:1), and his death and burial at Gibeah (24:33; Moore 1895: 433–34; Martin 1975: 213; Soggin 1981: 293; Gray 1986: 357, 386), but it is consistent with the association of Aaron qua eponym of the bénê aahåron with Bethel. That the Bethel connection can be deduced from the parallels between the episode of the Golden Calf (Exodus 32), in which Aaron plays the leading role, and the cult establishment of Jeroboam at Bethel (1 Kings 12) has long been acknowledged, and by this time hardly calls for further elaboration.13 The episode concludes with the slaughter of the apostates, abetted by Aaron, at the hands of the bénê lewî, who in consequence were assured of priestly status (Exod 32:25–29). The same note of disparagement as we hear in the texts from Zechariah and Haggai quoted earlier can be picked up in Deut 9:20, where Aaron is saved from death at the hands of an angry God by the intercession of Moses. A strong case can be made for the thesis that the Golden Calf episode in the Sinai-Horeb pericope (Exodus 32) was edited, and perhaps even composed, by a Deuteronomistic author as a polemical rewriting of what was originally the cult etiology of the Bethel sanctuary.14 The parallel etiology of the Dan sanctuary in Judg 18:27–31, consisting in the setting up of Micah’s icon (pesel) in the newly-conquered city, gave rise to embarrassment of a different kind, since the Dan priesthood traced its origins back to none other than Moses. It is not surprising therefore that the Masoretes felt obliged to disguise the association with Moses by introducing a nun suspensum, transforming “Moses” into the reprobate “Manasseh” at the stroke of a pen (Judg 18:30). In neither Deuteronomy nor the associated History are priests known as ‘sons of Aaron’ (bénê aahåron). In Deuteronomy the standard

designation ‘Levitical priests’ (hakkohånîm haléwiyyîm) would in fact appear to have a polemical edge in view of the notice that the priests appointed at Bethel by Jeroboam were non-Levitical (1 Kgs 12:31). If it is accepted that both Deuteronomy and the History date in their final form to the Neo-Babylonian period, currently the opinio communis, the much-discussed centralization of cultic activity in Jerusalem, repeated redundantly in the law section of the book (chaps. 12 and 16, in particular), would be especially relevant to and consistent with the situation existing at that time as I have described it. In other words, the injunction to sacrifice and celebrate the festivals only in Jerusalemwhether the law was ever implemented or not—only makes good sense in the very limited confines of the province after the Babylonian conquest. The same could be said about the uncompromising rejection of non-Yahvistic cults and opposition to their practitioners among the indigenous inhabitants attested in Deuteronomy (Deut 7:1–6; 9:15–21; 12:1–4, 29–31) and the last eleven chapters of Isaiah (Isa 57:3–13; 65:112; 66:3, 17). Further confirmation of the association of the bénê aahåron with Bethel is at hand in the prophetic condemnation of the Eli priesthood at Shiloh recorded by the Historian (1 Sam 2:27–36). The ancestor of this priestly family, chosen by God to offer sacrifice and wear the ephod (v. 28), can be none other than Aaron, and the ‘faithful priest’ (kohen neaéman) who will displace the descendants of Aaron (v. 35) none other than Zadok. This is not exactly what happened, however, because the priestly genealogies suggest a compromise by which the Zadokites were incorporated into the Aaronite line, but the incident testifies to conflict between two priestly factions preceding the final compromise. Aaronite descent is also indicated by the location of Eleazar, Aaron’s son, in Shiloh during the conquest of the land (Josh 19:51; 21:1–2), followed by Phineas, his son, at Bethel (Judg 20:28). Of special interest in this respect is the parallelism between the condemnation of the Shiloh priesthood, descended from Aaron, in 1 Sam 2:27–36, and that of the Bethel cult and its priesthood in 1 Kgs 13:1–10. Both condemnations are delivered by an anonymous “man of God” using the traditional prophetic incipit (1 Sam 2:27; 1 Kgs 13:1–2), both predict bad news for the priests in the distant future, and both give a verifiable sign in confirmation of the prediction (1 Sam 2:34; 1 Kgs 13:3). The Historian is making his point by placing the reprobation of the Shiloh-Bethel priesthood at important points in his History: the beginning of the prophetic movement (see 1 Sam 3:1a) and the beginning of the period of the kingdoms.



104 Joseph Blenkinsopp
The “law of the Temple” in Ezekiel 40–48 calls for a brief comment at this point. Whether the so-called Zadokite strand is from Ezekiel or a later scribal hand, it testifies to the priestly faction that opposed the Aaronite or proto-Aaronite priesthood in Neo-Babylonian Judah. To judge by the patronymic, Joshua ben Jehozadak (Hag 1:1, 12; Zech 3:110; 6:8–14) was the principal representative of the Zadokite house in the early Persian period. According to the Zadokite strand in Ezekiel, all legitimate priests are Levitical, but among Levitical priests only the descendants of Zadok (mizzerao ßadôq, bénê ßadôq, Ezek 40:45–46; 43:19; 44:15; 48:11) are legitimate. In this Zadokite strand, restriction of the priestly office to Zadokites is justified on the grounds that they and they alone remained faithful to their charge ‘when the Levites went astray’ (kaaaser taoû haléwiyyîm, 48:11). Wellhausen took the “time of straying” to refer to the period prior to the abolition of the “high places” (Wellhausen 1927: 115–19) but, since the author must have known that quite a bit of priestly straying took place after that point in time, the reference is more likely to the situation in Judah after the fall of Jerusalem (Blenkinsopp 1998: 41–42). How tensions and conflicts between these priestly factions were resolved is beyond the scope of this inquiry. Our sources for the early Persian period, meager and uncertain of interpretation as they are, testify to conflict in Achaemenid Judah, not least between the dominant Judeo-Babylonian element and indigenous groups both within the province and in neighboring territories. If the hypothesis presented above can be sustained, opposition to the reestablishment of Jerusalem as the cult center of the province and of the Jewish ethnos elsewhere must have played a part. Archaeological data are notoriously subject to revision but, if the evidence for the destruction of sites in Benjamin, including Bethel (Beitin), in the early fifth century b.c.e. holds up (Stern 1982: 254), it would not be surprising if religious factors had a significant part to play. Be that as it may, the resolution came in the form of a compromise between Aaronites and Zadokites, the final expression of which can be read off in the priestly genealogies (especially 1 Chr 5:27–41). In these matters, we are working more in the interstices of the biblical texts than with information that they explicitly provide. Much is uncertain, but the several lines of inquiry that I have pursued converge on a strong probability: that during most or all of the period between the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple and its rebuilding, Bethel served as the alternative, imperially-sponsored sanctuary associated with the administrative center at Mizpah; and that this privileged

position of Bethel put the priests claiming descent from Aaron who functioned there in serious but by no means undisputed contention for cultic supremacy after the restoration of Jerusalem in the early Persian period.

The Relationship of the Priestly Genealogies
to the History of the
High Priesthood in Jerusalem
Gary N. Knoppers
Pennsylvania State University
Of all the priestly lineages found within the Hebrew Bible, the priestly genealogy of 1 Chr 5:27–41 is the longest. Most genealogies in the ancient Mediterranean world list just a few generations, but the lineage of 1 Chr 5:27–41 extends some 25 generations. The emphasis on continuity from Levi in the Ancestral age to Jehozadaq in the early sixth century b.c.e. is striking. The interest in heredity and the connections made between bloodlines and status were, of course, major issues in ancient times. One is reminded of the comment in the list in Ezra 2:61–63 (// Neh 7:63–65) that the returning priests who could not verify their pedigree were “exiled” from the priesthood. Given the paucity of thorough genealogical information about priests (for example, in earlier biblical books), some of the priests who considered themselves to be of excellent pedigree may have had difficulty substantiating their claims. But the problem of genealogical verification in Persian period Yehud was not a matter affecting just a few marginal priests (Willi 1999). However prominent the Zadoqite house became in preexilic and postexilic times, the origins of the Zadoqite line are shrouded in mystery. The Zadoq of Samuel has been described by Wellhausen (1885; 1889) as a homo novus, without precedent and without genealogy.1 Even the
1. Actually, in 2 Sam 8:17 (// 1 Chr 18:16) Zadoq is listed as the son of A ̇i†ub. On the textual problems in this verse, see Cross 1973: 212–15.

book of Ezekiel, which promotes the exclusive rights of the Zadoqites, does not furnish a genealogy for their eponymous ancestor.2 The long priestly genealogies in 1 Chr 5:27–41 and 6:35–38 are often thought to be a remedy for this problem. Living in the late Persian period or the early Hellenistic age, the authors of Chronicles create sweeping lineages from shorter fragments. A succession of high priests is traced back before the time of the founding of the First Temple. If the priestly lineage of Neh 12:10–11 documents a succession of chief priests in the Second Temple from Jeshua to Jaddua, the genealogies in Chronicles do the same for the First Temple from Zadoq to Jehozadaq.3 By linking Solomon’s contemporary Zadoq to a whole line of priests who served after him, the authors purportedly buttress the claims of Zadoqites to the high priesthood during the Persian age. But not all scholars agree that Chronicles furthers the cause of the Zadoqites. Some think that the book validates the claims of the Aaronide priests during the Persian period. In this line of thinking, the Aaronides and the Zadoqites represent two different priestly factions in Israel and Judah (Kennett 1904–5; Judge 1956; Meek 1929; Allan 1982; Blenkinsopp 1998).4 This second group of scholars cites two facts to support its position. First, Chronicles often employs the expression (“sons of Aaron”) to refer to priests.5 In contrast, it never employs the expression “sons of Zadoq” to refer to priests. Second, these scholars point to the fact that that the related priestly lineage in 1 Chr 6:35–38 begins with Aaron and not with Zadoq. The lineage of 1 Chr 5:27–41 begins even earlier, with Levi, before passing on to Qohath, Amram, Aaron, Eleazar, Zadoq, and assorted other figures. In this line of thinking, Chronicles strengthens the cause of the Aaronide priests in Persian period Judah. The figure of Zadoq is simply grafted onto a much broader and well
2. Ezek 48:11. The book traces the Zadoqites to Levi, but only the Zadoqites may approach Yhwh to minister to him (Ezek 40:46; 43:19–21; 44:9–16). 3. Jehozadaq (qdxwhy) appears often as the father of Jeshua, the high priest, in the biblical literature dealing with the early Achaemenid period (Hag 1:1, 12, 14; 2:2, 4; Zech 6:11; qdxwy in Ezra 3:2, 8; 5:2; 10:18). 4. In this hypothesis, the Zadoqites were supplanted, perhaps only temporarily, by the Aaronides during the exilic period. In a related line of thinking, the figure of Aaron was used genealogically to seal a compromise between certain exiled Levites and the Zadoqites (e.g., Cody 1969: 168–74). As a result of this reconciliation, both Zadoqites and non-Zadoqites became Aaronides. 5. 1 Chr 15:4; 23:13, 32; 24:1, 19, 31; 2 Chr 13:9, 10; 26:18; 29:21; 31:19; 35:14 (cf. 1 Chr 12:28). The expression, indebted to the verbiage found in the Priestly source, is much less common in Ezra–Nehemiah (cf. Neh 10:39; 12:47).

established Aaronide tree.6 In supporting the Aaronides, the Chronicler purportedly traces a contemporary sacerdotal institution all the way back to the time of Israel’s origins.7 The connection to Aaron legitimates Jehozadaq’s priesthood and, by implication, that of his Persian period successors. Both the Zadoqite and the Aaronide reconstructions share some assumptions. Both assume that the lineages pertain to high priests, and both seek to situate the genealogies socially in the context of ancient debates among different priestly houses. Both suppose that the Chronicler (or a later editor) wrote to support the claims of one particular group or priestly house in the Persian period. Both theories share some common notions about the composition of the genealogies. Many, but by no means all, commentators suppose that the Chronicler, having access to a short priestly genealogy, such as the priestly genealogy found in Ezra 7:1–5 or that in Neh 11:10–11 (// 1 Chr 9:10–11), invented a highly elaborate statement of ancestry that extended the older lineage and filled in its gaps. Since the line of descent found in 1 Chr 5:27–41 is even longer than the lineage found in 1 Chr 6:35–38, the former is often considered to be secondary to the latter. In other words, 1 Chr 5:27–41 is not only the longest but also the latest of the various priestly genealogies found within the Hebrew Bible. In what follows, I would like to reexamine a number of the common assumptions about the high priestly hypothesis. On the basis of a comparative analysis of relevant texts,8 I question whether the priestly genealogy of 5:27–41 is best viewed as simply an elaboration of one of the shorter lineages found in 1 Chr 6:35–38, Ezra 7:1–5, and Neh 11:10–11 (// 1 Chr 9:10–11). The genealogy of 5:27–41 may, in fact, be an abbreviated and stylized version of an even longer priestly genealogy. That Levi, Aaron, and Zadoq have prominent roles within the genealogies in 1 Chronicles 5–6 suggests that the author(s) adopts a highly nuanced
6. Some scholars do not view this as a simple process of grafting (Cross 1973: 207–15; Olyan 1982; Laato 1994: 96–97). On both philological and historical grounds, these scholars tie Zadoq to Aaronide circles in Hebron (Num 26:58; Josh 21:10, 13; 1 Chr 6:42). In this theory, the highly unusual move of appointing both Zadoq and Abiathar as priests during David’s tenure represents a compromise designed to win support from two rival priestly houses. The Mushite clans are associated with Shiloh and Dan, while the Aaronides are associated with Bethel and Hebron. 7. By “the Chronicler,” I mean the author of 1 and 2 Chronicles. For a recent defense and overview of this position, see Japhet 1991: 298–313. 8. Especially, 1 Chr 5:27–41; 9:10–11 // Neh 11:10–11; Ezra 7:1–5; 1 Esd 8:1–2; 2 Esd 1:1–3; Josephus, Ant. 10.152–53; 20.231.

stance to the whole issue of legitimate priests. Rather than being a highly partisan participant in these debates, the Chronicler may be better viewed as attempting to mediate them.
High Priests or Priests? The Consensus Critiqued
The two major theories about the composition and functions of the priestly genealogies in Chronicles have some merit. They point to the particularly close connections of the line of descent in 1 Chr 5:27–41 to the line in 1 Chr 6:35–38 and infer that the genealogies are works of literary artifice. The scholars who propose these theories also raise legitimate questions about whether the priestly lineages are truly lineages or are, rather, lists of high priests cast as lineages. The antiquity of the high priestly position is itself in doubt, because most of the historiographic and prophetic materials point to the late Judahite monarchy as the earliest period in which references are made to chief priests and high priests.9 Bartlett contends, for example, that most, if not all, of the major Temple priests during the monarchy were royal appointments.10 The king’s choice for the office served only as long as the king wished (Bartlett 1968: 13–15). Only in a few cases is priestly succession documented in the Deuteronomistic History.11 What the lineages of 1 Chr 5:27–41 and 6:35–38 offer, in this reconstruction, is not an actual hereditary succession of high priests but a high priestly succession in genealogical dress.
9. 2 Kgs 12:11; 22:4, 8; 23:4; 25:18 (// Jer 52:24). Compare with Josh 20:6. The terms “chief priest” and “high priest” become much more common, of course, during the Achaemenid period (Lev 21:10; Num 35:25, 28; Zech 3:1, 8; 6:11; Hag 1:1, 12, 14; 2:2, 4; Neh 3:1, 20; 2 Chr 19:11; 24:6, 11; 26:20; 34:9; Gunneweg 1965). 10. 1 Kgs 1:7; 2:27–35; Amos 7:10–17 (cf. Judg 18:19). See, further, Bartlett 1968 and Cody 1969: 100–107. 11. The central question is not whether there was ever such a thing as a hereditary priesthood in ancient Israel (pace Wellhausen 1885: 127–31). Rather, the question centers on whether the priests who served at the Jerusalem Temple did so at the king’s behest. Royal prerogative is the pertinent consideration (Cody 1969; Rooke 2000). In this context, one should distinguish between the impulse toward priestly succession within a given family and the occupation of major priestly posts. There is evidence from various lands in the ancient Mediterranean world of heredity in cultic affairs. A stela from Carthage, for example, mentions three generations of priests from one family (KAI 81). Some priestly offices were handed down through the generations in ancient Egypt (te Velde 1995: 1733–35). Continuity in the holding of a prebend was a mark of status. Nevertheless, even in Egypt a specific bloodline did not automatically entitle one to the occupation of a specific post or overrule all other considerations. Important priestly offices were always subject to royal ratification. Central and local officials might also seek temple positions for friends and relatives (O’Connor 1995: 321).



The Priestly Genealogies and the High Priesthood 113
In spite of these strengths, both theories exhibit some serious shortcomings and need to be rethought. To begin with, one has to question whether the lineages of 1 Chr 5:27–41 and 6:35–38 are indeed lists of high priests recast as a hereditary succession. The texts themselves make no such assertion. The first genealogy (5:27–41) simply begins with the rubric “the sons of Levi.” Were either Levi or Qohath high priests? When the genealogy switches from segmented to linear form, it does so with a view to Eleazar’s progeny (v. 30). Unlike the author of Ezra 7:5, who refers to Aaron as ‘the chief priest’ (hakkohen haroas), the author does not label any of the figures in these verses as ‘the chief priest’ (hakkohen haroas)12 or ‘the high priest’ (hakkohen haggadôl).13 Second, the priestly genealogy in 1 Chr 6:35–38, stretching from Aaron to A ̇imaaz, is prefaced by a job description (1 Chr 6:34).14 Its work profile for “Aaron and his sons” revolves around their “sacrificing upon the altar of burnt offering and upon the incense altar for every work of the most holy place to atone for Israel according to all that Moses the servant of God had commanded” (1 Chr 6:35). The passage connects the priests to sacrifice in much the same way that the work of the Levitical singers (1 Chr 6:33) is tied to song. There is nothing said about high priests, chief priests, commanders of the house of God, or leaders of the priests (¶arê hakkohånîm; 2 Chr 36:14; Ezra 8:24). There is no discussion of the supervision of other priests or of the administration of the sanctuary. In speaking of the high priest, the Priestly authors refer to his being anointed with oil (Lev 21:10; Num 35:25) and to his “consecration to wear the vestments” (Lev 21:10), but no such references appear here.15 Third, in narrative sources (Kings and Chronicles) some of these figures are listed as having one of the titles, ‘the chief priest’ (hakkohen haroas) or ‘the high priest’ (hakkohen haggadôl), but most are not. A comparison with the Davidic genealogy may be apt. Even though this lineage plots a continuous succession from David (3:1) to the generation
12. 2 Kgs 25:18 // Jer 52:24; 2 Chr 19:11; 24:6, 11; 26:20. 13. Lev 21:10; Num 35:25, 28; Josh 20:6; 2 Kgs 12:11; 22:4, 8; 23:4; Zech 3:1, 8; 6:11; Hag 1:1, 12, 14; 2:2, 4; Neh 3:1, 20; 2 Chr 34:9. 14. It is true that 1 Chr 6:35 (or 1 Chr 6:34–38) may be the work of a later editor (see Relationships among the Priestly Lineages, pp. 116–122, below); but, even if this is so, the passage still provides vital clues about how an early interpreter understood the lineage of priests in 1 Chr 5:29–41. Even as an addition, 1 Chr 6:35–38 is still the earliest exposition of the priestly line of descent available to us. 15. On the figure of the high priest in the Priestly writing, see most recently Rooke 2000: 11–39.

of Elioenai many centuries later (3:24), no one contends that all of the figures mentioned actually held kingly office.16 To be sure, some of David’s descendants rose to kingship, but others did not. Fourth, some of the most prominent priests who figure in the Deuteronomistic and Chronistic accounts of the Judahite monarchy, most notably Jehoiada (2 Kgs 11:4–12:17; 2 Chr 22:11–24:3), Uriah (2 Kgs 16:10–16), and Azariah (2 Chr 26:20), do not appear in this account.17 To complicate matters further, the narrative portions of Chronicles mention a number of priests and Levites who, while not having the titles “chief priest” or “high priest,” are depicted as sacerdotal leaders or as heavily involved in the supervision of the Temple. These include “Jehoiada, supervisor (nagîd) for Aaron” (1 Chr 12:28), “Azariah, supervisor of the house of God” (négîd bêt haaélohîm; 2 Chr 31:13), and perhaps “Zechariah,” the son of Jehoiada (2 Chr 24:20–22).18 But with the possible exception of Azariah, none of these figures appears in the genealogy.19 In one case, Chronicles refers to three different “supervisors of the house of God”: Óilqiah, Zechariah, and Je ̇iel (négîdê bêt haaélohîm; 2 Chr 35:8).20 Nevertheless, only one (Óilqiah) appears in this genealogy.21 In other words, the problem is not one of terminology. Whether one chooses the title hakkohen haroas, hakkohen haggadôl, or
16. The genealogist ties David to the patriarch Judah by linking David’s ancestors to Ram (1 Chr 2:10), the grandson of the patriarch Judah (2:3–9). See further Knoppers 2001: 35–50. 17. It should be pointed out that figures bearing the title ‘the priest’ (ˆhkh) in Chronicles are also presented as high/chief priests (Koch 1992). See 1 Chr 16:39; 24:6; 29:22 (Zadoq); 2 Chr 22:11; 23:8, 9, 14; 24:2, 20, 25 (Jehoiada); 26:17 (Azariah); 34:14, 18 (Óilqiah). In contexts in which clarification is needed (for example, the mention of other priests), the author adds further specification—lwdgh ˆhkh or varh ˆhkh. 18. The name Zechariah (whyrk[z]) appears on a recently discovered Hebrew ostracon (line 3) as the addressee in a widow’s petition (Bordreuil, Israel, and Pardee 1996). This inscription has yet to undergo full critical scrutiny. 19. At first glance, it might be tempting to correlate this Azariah (III) and the previous Azariah (II; 1 Chr 5:37) with the two Azariahs appearing during the reigns of Uzziah (2 Chr 26:17) and Óezeqiah (2 Chr 31:10; Laato 1994: 93), but the placement of these two figures frustrates such an attempt. Azariah III, for example, appears after the time of Óilqiah (and Josiah—2 Kgs 22:8–12; 2 Chr 34:9, 14–22; 35:8). Confirmation of this may come from epigraphic evidence. The name appears on a late-seventh/early-sixth-century Jerusalem bulla, whyqlj ˆb whyrz[l ‘belonging to Azaryahu son of Óilqiyahu’ (Davies 1991, §100.827; Schneider 1988) and on a seal dating to the same time, whyqlj whyrz[l ‘belonging to Azaryahu (son of) Óilqiyahu’ (Avigad and Sass 1997: 139, §307). 20. In 1 Chr 9:20 Phine ̇as (pîn ̇as) is depicted as the supervisor (nagîd) of the Qohathites in their work of service (méleaket haoabôdâ) as guards of the threshold of the Tent. Cf. Exod 6:25; Num 25:11–13; Josh 24:33; Judg 20:28; Sir 45:23; 50:24. 21. Cf. 2 Kgs 22:8–12; 2 Chr 34:9, 14–22; 35:8.



The Priestly Genealogies and the High Priesthood 115
négîd bêt haaélohîm, there is at best only a partial correlation between the figures who bear these titles in narrative sources and the figures who appear in this lineage. One could argue, of course, that these absentee priests dropped out of 1 Chr 5:27–41 through some sort of textual accident (for example, haplography), but it seems unlikely that all of these figures did so. Moreover, the genealogy appearing in Josephus (Ant. 10.152–53; 20.231) mentions a number of additional figures between Zadoq and Jehozadaq, but only one of these names (Ourias = Uriah [hY;riWa]) matches those of the missing priests.22 Given the universal understanding of the genealogy as a high priestly list, it is not surprising that scholars have expressed consternation that Azariah would be singled out as officiating at the Solomonic sanctuary.23 Why mention Azariah (1 Kgs 4:2), as opposed to Zadoq (2 Sam 20:25; 1 Kgs 2:35; 4:4–5; Josephus, Ant. 8.12; 10.152; 20.231), Jehoiada, or Óilqiah? The question may, however, presume too much. Not all of the figures listed in vv. 29–41 may have been regarded by the author as high priests. Some of the persons mentioned in the genealogies may have, in the author’s judgment, served as high priests, but others may not have. If not all, or even most, of the figures were viewed as chief priests, it should not occasion great surprise that a particular figure would be singled out as serving at Solomon’s shrine. The
22. The medieval chronicle Seder Olam Zuta (atwz μlw[ rds) provides an even longer sequence of priests in the First Temple period, each of whom is tied to the reign of a particular king. The authors of this chronicle seem to be indebted to the work of Josephus, but they go beyond it in positing high priests, for example, Joa ̇az (in the reign of Jehoshapha†), Jehoiarib/Jehoiada (in the reign of Jehoram), Jehoshapha†/Joshua (in the reign of Azariah), Jehoiada (in the reign of Athaliah/Joash), who are unmentioned in the lists provided by Josephus. Some of the names appearing in the chronicle (for example, Jehoiada in the reign of Athaliah/Joash) can be explained exegetically. Prominent priests mentioned in the historical literature of the Bible, but who go unmentioned in the genealogies, are inserted into the sequence of high priests. On the sequence in Seder Olam Zuta, see Beckwith (1985: 469–71), although I do not agree with all of his attempts to correlate the names appearing in Seder Olam Zuta with the (Greek) names mentioned by Josephus. 23. Following many commentators, I am transposing the anecdote of 1 Chr 5:36 to 5:35: “it was he who officiated as a priest in the Temple which Solomon built in Jerusalem” (cf. 1 Kgs 4:2). At some point in the transmission of the text of Chronicles, the Azariah of v. 35 became confused with the Azariah of v. 36. This anecdote does not appear in the other genealogies. Instead, Josephus (Ant. 10.152) and the other lists provide other variants. Josephus speaks of Zadoq as the first high priest (archiereus) of the Temple that Solomon built, while 1 Chr 9:11 (// Neh 11:11) depicts A ̇i†ub as “the supervisor (nagîd) of the house of God.” Ezra 7:5 mentions Aaron as the ‘chief priest’ (varh ˆhkh), while 1 Esd 8:2 describes Aaron as the ‘first priest’ (protou hiereos). 2 Esd 1:1–3 lacks any reference to a particular priest or leader of the Temple.



116 Gary N. Knoppers
anecdote about Azariah may serve as a clue about the function of the genealogy. Rather than being a lineage of high priests, the genealogy of vv. 27–41 may simply be a corrupted version of a Qohathite (Aaronide) lineage. In the genealogist’s reckoning, some of the priests, such as Azariah, served as major figures within the Jerusalem Temple administration, but others may not have. The point of such a genealogy is to establish a line of priests that could be profitably employed in Persian period Yehud (see Ezra 7:1–5; 1 Chr 9:10–11; 1 Esd 8:1–2; 2 Esd 1:1–3), rather than to provide a continuous list of chief priests.
Relationships among the Priestly Lineages
Scholars have long observed some significant overlap among the priestly genealogies in Chronicles (1 Chr 5:27–41; 6:35–38; 9:10–11), Ezra (7:1–5), Nehemiah (11:10–11), 1 Esdras (8:1–2), 2 Esdras (1:1–3), and Josephus (Ant. 8.12; 10.151–53; 20.231). Not only are many of the names common to the various lineages, but so also are entire sequences of names. The question thus arises whether all these lines of descent derive from a common source or whether one of the lineages is the source for all of the others. Bartlett (1968), Johnson (1988: 38–41), Braun (1986: 83), and others think that the longest list (1 Chr 5:27–41) is the latest of the various lists found in Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, 1 Esdras, and 2 Esdras. The briefest of all the lists—Neh 11:10–11 // 1 Chr 9:10–11—is the oldest (or based on the oldest sources). This prevalent way of dealing with the differences among the lists legitimately calls attention to the possibility of expansion among the lists. One wonders, for example, whether the unparalleled appearance of Eli, Phine ̇as, and A ̇ijah before A ̇i†ub and Zadoq in the late genealogy of 2 Esd 1:1–3 (second century c.e.) attempts to harmonize the lineage of the Elides (1 Sam 14:3; 22:20; 1 Kgs 2:27, 35) with that of the Aaronides.24 The similarities between the the lineages of 1 Chr 5:27–41 and 6:3538 are particularly noteworthy. In line with the dictum lectio brevior potior, many scholars view the shorter priestly lineage of 6:35–38 as the base for the longer lineage of 5:27–41 (for example, Noth 1957: 120–21; Willi 1972: 214; Braun 1986: 81–82; Kartveit 1989: 77–87). In this reconstruction, the elaborate lineage of 5:27–41 is a later addition based on the parallel and more limited list of Aaronide priests in 6:35–38 (Aaron
24. The three extra names appearing in 2 Esd 1:2 (Eli, Phine ̇as, and A ̇ijah) before A ̇i†ub and Zadoq are not found in any of the other lineages (Ezra 7:1–5; 1 Chr 5:29–41; 9:10–11 [// Neh 11:10–11]; 1 Esd 8:1–2; Josephus, Ant. 10.152–53). Cf. 1 Sam 14:3; 22:20.



The Priestly Genealogies and the High Priesthood 117
to A ̇imaaz). But many of the arguments tying brevity to originality are problematic. It may be appropriate to begin with the make-up of the priestly genealogy in 5:27–41 and its relationship to 6:35–38. In my judgment, there is much to be said for the minority view that the lineage of the “descendants of Aaron” in 6:35–38 is a later addition, based on the parallel and more extensive list of priests in 5:27–41 (for example, Möhlenbrink 1934: 203–5; Williamson 1982: 74). To begin with, the genealogy of 5:27–41 fits better contextually. Having Levi appear first conforms to the regular pattern of the genealogies in 1 Chr 2:38:40, in which the eponymous ancestors of the Israelite tribes appear in the initial position.25 The origins of each tribe are traced back to the Ancestral age (2:1–2). In conformity with this pattern, the Levitical genealogies emphasize the age of Matriarchs and Patriarchs as pivotal to the development of Israel’s priestly tribe (1 Chr 5:27–28; 6:1–4a, 23, 28, 32). Second, mentioning Qohath (5:27–28) conforms to the interest in the Qohathite phratry displayed elsewhere in the Levitical genealogy.26 By contrast, the reference to “the sons of Aaron” in 6:35 is a non sequitur, genealogically speaking. There is no antecedent in the earlier lineages for the reference to Aaron in 6:35, apart from the mention of Aaron in 5:29 and the mention of the duties of “Aaron and his sons” in 6:34. Third, the coverage of the priestly genealogy of 6:35–38 is somewhat odd, when seen against the other priestly genealogies. The other lineages all extend to the Neo-Babylonian period or beyond, whereas the lineage of 6:35–38 only extends to A ̇imaaz, the son of Zadoq. The partial repetition of the genealogy from 5:27–41 in 6:35–38 could have been created when an editor wished to insert a priestly complement to the united monarchy–centered genealogies of the Levitical singers (1 Chr 6:1–32).27
25. 1 Chr 2:3; 4:24; 5:1, 11, 23, 27; 6:1; 7:1, 6, 13, 14, 20, 30; 8:1. 26. See 1 Chr 6:3, 7–12, 18–23, 39–41, 46, 51–55, and further below. 27. The Levitical genealogies typically begin with the Ancestral age and center on the united monarchy. In their present form, the lineages exhibit an eightfold structure. There are two genealogies of priests (5:27–41; 6:35–38), two genealogies of Gershonites and Gershonite singers (6:5–7, 24–28), two genealogies of Qohathites and Qohathite singers (6:712, 18–23), and two genealogies of Merarites and Merarite singers (6:14–15, 29–32). Within this eightfold structure the attention given to the priests forms an inclusio around the coverage given to the Levites. Two genealogies of priests (5:27–41; 6:35–38) frame six genealogies of Levites (6:1–33). In this respect, the lineage of Aaronides (6:35–38) complements the lineages of the Levites (Qohathites, Asaphites, and Merarites in 6:18–33; Oeming 1990: 144–57; Japhet 1993: 143–65; Johnstone 1997: 82–97). Given the stated connection with the United Monarchy, it is appropriate that the lineage stops with A ̇imaaz, the son of Zadoq (6:38), rather than continuing to the Babylonian exile (cf. 1 Chr 5:41).



118 Gary N. Knoppers
To return to the question of whether the shortest of all the priestly lineages (1 Chr 9:10–11 // Neh 11:10–11) has priority over the rest of the priestly lists in biblical and postbiblical writings (Ezra 7:1–5; 1 Esd 8:1–2; 2 Esd 1:1–3; 1 Chr 5:27–41; 6:35–38), it will be helpful to discuss some basic issues. First, there is the issue of length. If an editor expanded a short lineage to create a priestly genealogy that would span the ages from the time of Levi to the time of the Babylonian exile, the 25-generation genealogy of 1 Chr 5:27–41 would be in all likelihood too short for the extensive period covered.28 By way of contrast, Josephus presents 17 (Ant. 10.152–53) or 18 (Ant. 20.131) generations of priests following Zadoq.29 The total of 12 generations of priests may also be compared with the tally of 17 generations of kings from Solomon to Zedeqiah in the Davidic genealogy (1 Chr 3:10–27). A line of descent that mentions 12 names to cover the period extending from the tenth century to the sixth century (Zadoq I to Jehozadaq) is inherently difficult. Second, the theory neglects the possibility that some of the lists (for example, 6:35–38) may represent abridgments of a longer list either directly or indirectly related to 1 Chr 5:27–41. The variations in length do not seem to have resulted from a process of amorphous growth.30 Both the beginnings and the endings of the genealogies reflect conscious choices on the part of authors. The point about endings should be quite obvious. The editor of the book of Ezra incorporates Ezra into a traditional priestly genealogy that links Ezra to Seraiah and ultimately to ‘the chief priest’ (hakkohen haroas) Aaron (7:1–5). The editor of Neh 11:10–11 (// 1 Chr 9:10–11) ties the figures of Jachin, Jedaiah, and Jehoi
28. This is especially true if one takes the common figure used in anthropology of 20 years or at most 25 years per generation. See, for example, the reconstruction of Katzenstein (1962: 382–83), which employs a 20-year average per generation. Only if one employs a figure of 40 or more years per generation (see below) does one approximate the time span in question. 29. The additional priests listed in Josephus (Ant. 10.153) are not found in either the MT or the LXX (Iouelos, Iothamos, Ourias, Nerias, Odaias). These names show a Hebrew Vorlage (yôael, yôtham, aûrîyah, nerîyah, hôdawyah) and cannot be dismissed for text-critical purposes. The medieval chronicle Seder Olam Zuta (n. 22) mentions even more priests than Josephus does. Interestingly enough, there is only a partial overlap among the priests mentioned in this work, the priests mentioned in the Chronistic genealogies, and the priests mentioned by Josephus. 30. One of the contributions of the work of Wilson (1977) on ancient Near Eastern genealogies was to demonstrate that the fluidity long recognized to be characteristic of oral genealogies also obtained for written genealogies. Wilson gave special attention to the differences among the Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian king lists.

arib to a priestly lineage.31 The author of 1 Chr 6:35–38 ends his lineage, appropriately to the context (6:16–18, 24, 29), with A ̇imaaz of the United Monarchy. Similarly, the different starting points of the genealogies do not seem to be accidental. That the genealogy of Josephus begins with Zadoq and that of Neh 11:10–11(// 1 Chr 9:10–11) with the father of Zadoq privileges the Zadoqites. In these lineages, the genealogy of priests becomes a genealogy of Zadoqites. By contrast, the lineages of 1 Chronicles 6 and Ezra 7 (1 Esdras 8; 2 Esdras 1) privilege Aaron. In these lineages, the genealogy of priests becomes a genealogy of Aaronides. Since the names appearing at the beginning and end of ancient genealogies were most relevant in fulfilling the author’s purpose (Wilson 1977), the variant beginnings and endings of these genealogies should not occasion too much surprise. The point is that at least some of the writers may have had access to longer versions of the priestly genealogy than the genealogies that these writers actually chose to include within their works. Third, the theory approaches the differences among the lists from primarily a literary (redaction history) point of view. A series of editors supposedly add a name or a cluster of names to an older and much briefer text. Redaction criticism has its legitimate place in the study of the priestly lineages. The beginnings and endings of these genealogies are, as we have seen, cases in point. But in addition to literary criticism, one should confront the evidence supplied by comparative anthropology and textual criticism. Genealogists may provide longer or shorter versions of lineages, depending on individual circumstances, context, and need.32 The genealogies themselves may be adjusted to reflect current social conditions (Wilson 1979; Thomas 1992). In this respect, one could make the claim that the author of 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:1011) has deliberately telescoped a much longer line of descent. Since the beginning and end of a lineage are critical, genealogically speaking, a genealogist may choose to highlight certain prominent names and ignore others. The middle past, covering intermediate generations, is the most likely to be shortened or left out altogether (Thomas 1989).
31. There are textual problems with both passages. See the treatments of Rudolph (1949; 1955); Cross (1975; 1998); Williamson (1985); Gunneweg (1987); and Blenkinsopp (1988). Since Jachin, Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib all figure in the priestly courses (1 Chr 24:119), Blenkinsopp contends that the names represent three postexilic priestly houses. 32. To take one example, see the shorter (§1.2–3) and longer (§2.1.3–6) versions of the genealogy of Darius in the same (Behistun) Old Persian royal inscription. The latter immediately follows the former (Kent 1953: 116 [DB I]).

From a source-critical standpoint, one has to inquire about the state of a genealogy available to a given writer, assuming that the writer had access to an oral or written source. Whether a writer has access to a full or an abbreviated genealogy will very much affect his own presentation of that genealogy. From a text-critical standpoint, one must ask whether changes may have been made to that genealogy through the course of textual transmission. Most text-critical variants arise from inadvertent or unconscious scribal errors. Since the major priestly lineages in the Hebrew Bible all stem from late books and are related in some fashion to one another, source criticism is very much related to textual criticism. With a focus on the latter, one can make some progress in understanding the internal relations among the major witnesses.

Examination of these lineages reveals clear signs of textual confusion, some of which may have been caused by haplography.37 In Ezra 7:1–5 (and 1 Esd 8:1–2) a major haplography (homoioteleuton) may have occurred from Amariah (I) to Azariah (father of Amariah II). The considerable gap in the ascending list of priests in 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:10–11) may have also been triggered by haplography. The other possibility is that the A ̇i†ub who appears as the grandfather of Zadoq in 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:10–11) is in fact A ̇i†ub II (Bartlett 1968). In this case, 15 of the first 25 names in 1 Chr 5:27–41 are lacking in 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:10–11). The problem is Meraioth, however, who appears as the son of Zera ̇iah in 1 Chr 5:32–33; 6:36–37; Ezra 7:3; and 1 Esd 8:2 (Mareroth tou Zaraiou). There is only one Zera ̇iah attested, Zera ̇iah b. Uzzi of 1 Chr 5:32; 6:36; and Ezra 7:4 (1 Esd 8:2, Zaraiou tou Saouia). This evidence makes it more likely that 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:10–11) has suffered a major haplography from Meshullam to Zadoq (I) triggered by the repetition of Zadoq in the list (from Zadoq II to Zadoq I). To be sure, my theory does not explain why A ̇i†ub is the
33. On the name Shallum (μwlv), compare the Qohathite Meshullam (μlvm), who helps supervise the Temple reconstruction project in the time of Josiah (2 Chr 34:12). The list of priests in 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:10–11) mentions a Meshullam (μlvm) b. Zadoq. The two—Shallum (b. Zadoq) and Meshullam (b. Zadoq)—are likely variants of the same name. 34. Seraiah was “chief priest” at the time of the second Babylonian exile of 586 b.c.e. (2 Kgs 25:18, 21; Jer 52:24, 27). Ezra’s lineage is traced through Seraiah (Ezra 7:2; 1 Esd 8:2; 2 Esd 1:3). The name is lacking in Josephus (Ant. 10.153) and 1 Chr 9:10–11 but not in Neh 11:11. The name reappears in the sequence provided by the medieval chronicle Seder Olam Zuta. The discrepancy between the two totals of Josephus—17 (Ant. 10.15253) versus 18 (Ant. 20.231) generations of First Temple high priests—may reflect the loss of Seraiah. The Babylonian Talmud (b. Yoma 9) also maintains that there were 18 high priests during the First Temple era. It is interesting to note that Joseph’s Hypomnestikon (fourth–fifth century c.e.), which uses both Josephus’s Jewish Antiquities and the Greek Chronicles, mentions Saraios but not Azaraias (LXX 1 Par. 6:14)/Azaros (Josephus); Grant and Menzies 1996: 44–45. 35. Jehozadaq (1 Chr 5:40) is absent from all of the Ezra lists (Ezra 7:1–5; 1 Esd 8:1–2; 2 Esd 1:1–3) and from 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:10–11). 36. So Ant. 10.150, 153; Iosedekos in Ant. 11.73; Iosadakes in Ant. 20.231. 37. See further the textual notes on 1 Chr 5:27–41 in my commentary (forthcoming).

father of Meraioth (1 Chr 9:10–11 // Neh 11:10–11) instead of his grandson (1 Chr 5:33; 6:37), but this is a problem for any theory.38 Given the evidence for haplography in the shorter lists, one cannot dismiss the value of the longer lists for scholarly reconstruction. In short, because of the anthropological evidence for telescoping and the text-critical evidence for haplography, it is unlikely that the shortest of all the priestly lineages was also the earliest lineage and the source of all of the others. It seems more likely, given the variants among the lineages, that the original source for all of the priestly lineages appearing in Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Josephus was not any one of the particular priestly genealogies found within these works.39 Presumably, such a list or genealogy could have originated with priestly scribes in the Second Temple. In addition (or alternatively), priestly families in the Persian and Hellenistic periods may have kept their own genealogies. In any case, given the comparative evidence from the ancient Mediterranean world, one should not think of such a list or genealogy as fixed and fast, immutable in all of its details. The work could have been drawn from and adapted (shortened, changed, lengthened) by different writers, depending on their backgrounds, interests, and social circumstances. Each writer would put the lineage to his own use and interpret it accordingly. If one version of the genealogy passed through a number of hands, one has to allow for the possibility, even the probability in this case, that it would suffer corruption. That such a lineage was not immutable can be seen, for example, in the many variants between the version of the genealogy in 1 Chr 5:27–41 and the later version of Josephus (Ant. 10.152–53). The issue is not simply the beginning and ending of the work in question but also its very content.
Structure, Adaptation, and Function
Returning to the long genealogy of 1 Chr 5:27–41, comparison between it and the other priestly lineages elucidates some of its distinctive features. Unlike all of the other priestly genealogies, it begins in seg
38. In the transmission of long, linear genealogies, names appearing in the middle sections are the ones mostly likely to be changed, omitted, or (inadvertently) reordered. 39. One might be tempted to point to the Chronicler’s version of the priestly genealogy (1 Chr 5:27–41), the longest of all the biblical priestly genealogies, as the original source, but this work bears its own clear signs of selection, stylization, and textual corruption (see further below). Hence, it seems that 1 Chr 5:27–41 is only indirectly related to the original source.



The Priestly Genealogies and the High Priesthood 123
mented form (1 Chr 5:27–29). The second part of the genealogy appears in descending linear form. The writer is indebted to earlier texts for his presentation of the segmentation in vv. 27–29 and for the information in v. 30 (for example, Gen 46:11; Exod 6:16–25; Num 3:2, 17–20). Many of the remaining relationships in vv. 31–41 are unique to Chronicles.
That the segmented line of descent in v. 27 begins with Levi is highly important, because it conforms to the consistent literary pattern displayed by the other major genealogies (see Relationships among the Priestly Lineages, pp. 116–122 above). In Chronicles the Ancestral age, and not the Sinaitic age, is of paramount importance for tracing the origins of each of Israel’s tribes.40 By using the same starting point as that used for the other tribes, the author underscores how important the Levites are to the very constitution of his nation. Of Levi’s three male offspring (Gershon, Qohath, and Merari), the author begins by tracing the lineage of the second son Qohath, whose descendants include Amram, Aaron, Eleazar, and Phine ̇as.41 Given the limitations of our sources, it is not totally clear what the emphasis on the Qohathites amounts to. By continuing the priestly line back to Qohath b. Levi, the genealogist distinquishes the entire Qohathite phratry from those of its peers. Within the larger structure provided by the Levitical lineages in Chronicles (1 Chr 5:27–6:66), the Qohathites occupy a privileged
40. It is useful, in this context, to keep the distinctive literary presentation of the Chronicler’s work separate from that of the Deuteronomist. See further Japhet 1989. 41. 1 Chr 6:1–2 presents a more traditional course by pursuing the lineage of the firstborn Gershon.

position. The Levitical genealogies open with a lineage of Qohathite priests (5:27–41). Similarly, the section on Levitical towns opens with Qohathite settlements in Judah and Benjamin (6:39b–45 // Josh 21:9–19). In listing the Qohathites first the author replicates the precedent of the Priestly writer in Numbers 4. There the Qohathites receive special attention, presumably because they have responsibility for transporting the most sacred sancta of the Tabernacle (Milgrom 1989: 24). References to the Qohathites may be found only in P, Chronicles, and (the Priestly influenced text of) Joshua 21.42 Within Chronicles the Qohathites appear both in the genealogies (1 Chr 5:27–41; 6:1–7, 18, 23, 39, 46, 51, 55; 9:32) and in the narratives about the monarchy (1 Chr 15:5; 23:6–12; 2 Chr 20:19; 29:12; 34:12).43 Vis-à-vis the Qohathites, there is also a contrast between the coverage of Chronicles and that of Ezra–Nehemiah. In the latter work, references to Qohath and the Qohathites are wanting. The priestly genealogy of 5:27–41 bears clear marks of stylization. The list purports to establish an unbroken succession from the Ancestral era (5:27) to the Babylonian exile (5:41). Taken as a whole, the genealogy has been structured to call attention to its beginning, center, and end. There are 25 descendants from Qohath to Jehozadaq. If Qohath is the first pertinent scion of Levi and Jehozadaq is the last, the midpoint is Zadoq. Twelve generations of priests precede him (Qohath to A ̇i†ub) and 12 generations of priests succeed him (A ̇imaaz to Jehozadaq). The chiastic arrangement of 5:27–41 draws attention to the figure of Zadoq,44 but it also draws attention to the importance of the beginning and end of the genealogy: Levi, representing the Ancestral age, and Jehozadaq, representing the beginning of the Neo-Babylonian period. Commentators have called attention to a possible connection to MT 1 Kgs 6:1, which dates the building of the Temple to 480 years after the exodus (12 generations x 40 = 480), but the exodus is not in view (Knoppers 1993: 95–96). Rather, the time of Zadoq marks the halfway point between the Ancestral era and the Babylonian exile. In the Chronicler’s
42. Gen 46:11; Exod 6:16–18; Num 3:17–30; 4:2–15; 7:9; 10:21; 16:1; 26:57–58; Josh 21:4, 5, 10, 20, 26. 43. Whereas the Priestly writers acknowledge Aaron’s Qohathite ancestry (e.g., Num 26:58–60), they usually distinguish between the status and work of Aaron (and his sons) and the status and work of the Levites (e.g., Num 3:1–4:49). 44. Zadoq also plays a consistent role during David’s reign (1 Chr 12:28; 15:11; 16:39; 18:16; 24:3, 6, 31; 25:11; 27:17; 29:22). Little sustained attention is given, however, to his actions and character.

a. A ̇imaaz appears as the son of Zadoq in a number of contexts (2 Sam 15:27, 36; 17:17, 20; 18:19–29; cf. 1 Kgs 4:15), but Azariah appears as the son of Zadoq in 1 Kgs 4:2. Recognizing that Hebrew ben can mean both ‘son’ and ‘descendant’, the genealogist may have harmonized the two claims by presenting A ̇imaaz as Zadoq’s son and Azariah as Zadoq’s grandson (1 Chr 5:35; Josephus, Ant. 10.152). b. The sequence in 1 Chr 5:37–38, “Amariah . . . A ̇i†ub . . . Zadoq” is suspect, given the appearance of these three names in precisely the same order in earlier verses (1 Chr 5:33–34; cf. Ezra 7:2–3 and 1 Esd 8:1–2). In 1 Chr 9:10–11 (// Neh 11:1011) an alternate sequence occurs (A ̇i†ub . . . Meraioth . . . Zadoq). To take another comparison, Josephus (Ant. 10.153) reads “Axioramos . . . Phideas . . . Soudaias.” I am unconvinced by the attempt to derive these Greek names from the Hebrew sequence Amariah, Jehoiada, and Zadoq (Katzenstein 1962: 383). If, for example, Josephus’s Vorlage read Zadoq, one would expect to find Sadokos (or something similar) in his genealogy, as one does at the beginning of his list (Ant. 10.152). That the sequence in vv. 37–38 duplicates the sequence found in vv. 33–34 suggests that the lineage of 1 Chr 5:27–41 is corrupt. The question involves not simply the repetition of certain names (the practice of papponymy was common in Persian and Hellenistic times) but the repetition of an entire sequence of names (contra Curtis and Madsen 1910: 129).



126 Gary N. Knoppers
stylized lineage, 12 generations (or 480 years) precede Zadoq and 12 generations (or 480 years) follow him.45 The two narrative notes found within the genealogy, pertaining to Azariah’s work in Solomon’s Temple and the exile during the tenure of Jehozadaq, underscore the import of the united monarchy and the exile in the genealogist’s overall schema.46 These two anecdotes clarify the vague chronology inherent in the genealogy itself. The list ends with Jehozadaq, but by implication the pattern of priestly succession extends into the Persian period.47
Appropriations and Negotiations
Given the consolidation (if not establishment) of the high priestly office in the Persian period and the appearance of some figures, identified in other (narrative) contexts as high priests or chief priests, it is not surprising that later interpreters construed the entire list of 1 Chr 5:2741 as a high priestly inventory. The priestly lineage in Ezra 7:1–5 may have contributed to this interpretive conclusion, because it explicitly refers to Aaron as the ‘the chief priest’ (hakkohen haroas). Josephus (Ant. 10.152–53; 20.224–31) repeatedly refers to the figures in his genealogy as high priests and emphasizes an unbroken high priestly succession. The point about succession is inherent to the passage, but the point about the genealogy’s being a high priestly lineage is a later extrapolation. Once the high priestly interpretation became dominant, early interpreters would be confronted with another question: who, precisely, belonged to the line of high priests?48 Given the different purposes to
45. Victor Hurowitz (personal communication) calls attention to the fact that Zadoq is the 12th priest in the sequence beginning with Aaron in the lineage of Ezra 7:1–5. 46. The second priestly genealogy (6:35–38) calls attention to the united monarchy in a different way. In the case of the latter list, the lineage begins with the Sinaitic era (Aaron) and ends with the united monarchy (1 Chr 6:35–38). If the Sinaitic era is the definitive age for the establishment of the priesthod, the united monarchy is the definitive age for the establishment of the Temple, its priests, and its singers (6:1–33). The Levitical singers receive their charge and their employment in the time of David and Solomon (6:16–17, 18, 24, 29). In short, one can discern a logic in the partial repetition of the list from 5:27–41. 47. There is no text-critical warrant (contra Rothstein and Hänel 1927; Michaeli 1967) to adding a reference to Jeshua (cf. Ezra 3:2; Hag 1:1). Both in the MT (followed by the LXX) and in Josephus (Ant. 10.153), the list ends with exile. 48. Josephus himself had to wrestle with this question in his treatment of the reigns of David and Solomon, in which both Zadoq and Abiathar functioned as priests. Josephus explained the situation by positing a transfer of the high priesthood from the line of Eleazar (or of Phine ̇as; Ant. 8.12) to the line of Ithamar (Ant. 5.361–62; cf. 1 Chr 5:27–29)



The Priestly Genealogies and the High Priesthood 127
which the priestly lineages could be put, it is not surprising that early interpreters disagreed about this issue.49 In this context, it is appropriate to return to one of the issues raised at the beginning of this essay, namely, whether the lineage of 5:27–41 constitutes a charter for Zadoqite control over the postexilic priesthood. This assertion needs to be qualified. To be sure, situating Zadoq within a long lineage validates Zadoqite claims to an excellent pedigree (Blenkinsopp 1998: 40–41). To underscore the point, Zadoq appears at the very center of the lineage. Nevertheless, the presentation cannot be construed as exclusively pro-Zadoqite. Chronicles characteristically speaks of the priests as “the sons of Aaron” (see above) and never as the sons of Zadoq. In only one instance does Chronicles refer to a house (dynasty) of Zadoq (2 Chr 31:10). In the case of the priestly genealogy in 5:27–41, the author pushes things back further. There are other priestly lines within the Levitical family tree. The segmented part of the genealogy (vv. 27–29) recognizes the existence of other offshoots of the Qohathite line and allows for the possibility that nonZadoqites could officiate as priests. Aside from the phratry traced through Eleazar, the other surviving priestly phratry within the broad Qohathite designation is the sons of Ithamar.50 In 1 Chr 24:5 both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar are described as ‘officers of the sanctuary and officers of God’ (¶arê-qodes wé¶arê haaélohîm). From the Chronicler’s point of view, the members of these sacerdotal families might serve in a variety of cultic posts, but it was their bloodline that made them eligible to fulfill such vocations.51 Recognizing the existence of different priestly lines in Chronicles clarifies why the figures included within the lineage of 5:27–41 do not all match the lists of personnel in Kings, Jeremiah, and Chronicles, who are said to have held the titles of hakkohen haroas, hakkohen haggadôl, and

during the time of Eli. If Eli was the first Ithamaride high priest, Abiathar was the last (Ant. 5.362; 8.10–11). With Solomon’s banishment of Abiathar, the high priesthood returned to the house of Eleazar/Phine ̇as. In this manner, Josephus could maintain an unbroken Aaronide succession of high priests throughout Israelite history.

négîd bêt haaélohîm. Given that the author is only furnishing one priestly pedigree, albeit for what he presents as the most prestigious line, he does not make any claim that all high priests or chief priests belonged to this particular lineage. The matter may be put differently. Even if the author of 1 Chr 5:27–41 had intended to supply a high priestly genealogy, that is, a list of Zadoqites who attained the high priesthood following the line that extends from Levi, Qohath, Amram, Aaron, Eleazar, and so forth to Zadoq, he would not have been compelled to include all of the figures mentioned in Kings, Jeremiah, and elsewhere in Chronicles, who carried the titles ‘the chief priest’ (hakkohen haroas), ‘the high priest’ (hakkohen haggadôl), and the ‘supervisor of the house of God’ (négîd bêt haaélohîm). From the perspective of the Chronicler, there were other descendants of Eleazar, as well as descendants of Ithamar, who would have been eligible to attain this high position in the preexilic era. These other figures were, after all, also “descendants of Aaron.” To be sure, the genealogist does not furnish long priestly lineages for the other Eleazarites or for the sons of Ithamar. This has the effect of showcasing the lineage from Levi to Jehozadaq. Such a continuity throughout the generations suggests divine favor. Nevertheless, the presentation in Chronicles provides a broader purview than other texts, such as Ezekiel’s Temple vision, which grants sole legitimacy to the Zadoqites. It is telling that the Chronicler’s presentation also differs from the later stance of the book of Ben Sira, which bestows lavish and extensive praise on Aaron and the Aaronic priesthood (45:6–22). Ben Sira’s coverage of Aaron is, in fact, almost triple that of his coverage of Moses (Sir 44:23–45:5), but his treatment of Israel’s heroes (Sir 44:149:16) makes no mention whatsoever of Zadoq. Nor does Zadoq figure in the lengthy panegyric to the high priest Simeon II (Sir 50:1–24). Only in the concluding litany of praise (Sir 51:12i–xvi), often considered to be a later addition on text-critical grounds (Skehan and Di Lella 1987: 568–71), do the sons of Zadoq make a brief appearance (Sir 51:12ix). Josephus (Ant. 20.224) begins one of his discussion of high priests with Aaron and states that, according to his sources, the only legitimate high priests stem from his descendants. Josephus seems to be indebted to a version of Chronicles for part of his list, but his presentation of this material differs in some respects from that of Chronicles.52 In some Second Temple writings, Levi himself is elevated to the priesthood.53
52. Given the differences in some names and his additional names, Josephus’s Vorlage cannot have been too close to the MT and LXX Chronicles. 53. Jub. 31:11–20; 45:16; T. Levi 2, 4, 5, 8–9; Aramaic Levi (cf. Deut 33:8–11; Mal 2:4–9). See further Kugel 1993 and Kugler 1996.

The Priestly Genealogies and the High Priesthood 129
Ben Sira, Aramaic Levi, Jubilees, and Josephus postdate Chronicles, but their positions reveal that debates about the priesthood did not disappear in the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods. Situating the Chronicler’s work within one camp or the other may not be particularly helpful. His stance cannot be construed as a passive aquiescence to the emergence of a new status quo; because, as the evidence provided by Malachi suggests, it is unlikely that any one stand on the priesthood won unanimous acceptance in the Neo-Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenistic periods (O’Brien 1990). It is more likely that the authors of Chronicles attempt to mediate different positions. The sons of Zadoq are related to Aaron (1 Chr 5:29) and appear within the context of a larger Levitical genealogy. The concern with whether Chronicles supports a pro-Zadoqite monopoly on the postexilic (high) priesthood ironically obscures one of the distinctive features of the presentation in 1 Chr 5:27–41. By situating the descendants of Zadoq within a broader Levitical genealogical context, the author avoids developing antitheses between priests and Levites, Aaronides and Zadoqites. The writer negotiates between established positions and synthesizes disparate traditions. In Chronicles the Aaronides are also, broadly speaking, Levites (1 Chr 5:27). In Chronicles even Zadoq is a Levite. The genealogies repeatedly speak of distinctions among Qohathites, Merarites, and Gershonites. Within these large phratries, there can be specializations. Some Qohathites are priests (1 Chr 5:27–41), while other Qohathites are singers (1 Chr 6:713, 18–23). The Qohathite priests clearly have a privileged position. But the Merarites, Qohathites, and Gershonites, who function as singers (1 Chr 6:5–33), can lay claim to the same impeccable roots (1 Chr 6:1–4) as the Qohathite priests (1 Chr 5:27–29). All are Levites, who share a common genealogy. Some biblical and postbiblical authors draw clear contrasts between sacerdotal groups, but the authors of Chronicles seem anxious to negotiate the differences between them.

Epoch and Genre:
The Sixth Century and the Growth
of Hidden Polemics

Preface
Deportations, destruction, changes of superpowers, living in exile yet maintaining national identity, the option of returning to the homeland, the reorganization of political and cultural life in the homeland, the efforts to rehabilitate a devastated land—these were the upheavals experienced by the Judeans in the sixth century b.c.e.1 In this constantly shifting reality, written records assumed a paramount, if not permanent, significance. They made it possible to explain the past, to interpret the will of God, to draw lessons about dealing with the present, and above all, to nurture hopes for the future. It is no wonder, therefore, that this was a period of intensive writing. It was during this time that the great Deuteronomistic compilation took place,2 including the beginning of the crystallization of the Torah literature,3 and more.4
1. For a general description of this period as a background for all the mentioned phenomena, see: Noth 1960: 280–316; Bright 1972: 310–55; Herrmann 1975: 274–306; Miller and Hayes 1986: 406–60; Ahlström 1993: 784–852. 2. Thus according to Noth (1981) and those who have followed him. On Noth’s heritage, see McKenzie and Graham 1994. I do not touch on the question of the early Deuteronomistic composition, because even scholars who support this possibility are convinced that the composition was compiled in the sixth century b.c.e. I therefore mention only two bibliographical items: Cross 1973 and Nelson 1981. 3. It is agreed by most scholars that the Torah literature in its final form was not completed before the sixth century b.c.e.; see recently Blenkinsopp 1992: 229–42. Following Martin Noth, many scholars accept the assumption that the compilation of the Tetrateuch (Genesis to Numbers) resulted from the crystallization of the Deuteronomistic History, to serve as its prologue; see, for example, Whybray 1987: 242. 4. In this period the prophecies of the prophets from before the destruction were edited, so they gained paramount importance; for example, an edition of Jeremiah’s prophecies was completed (see Hoffman 2001: 74–76). For another example, see the next paragraph.

Inevitably, the general circumstances gave rise to certain genre preferences. For example, it was during this time that national or public lamentations came to prominence, filling as they did a clear social need. It seems safe to assume that this period, in which no fewer than four days of mourning were established, all of them related to the destruction (the fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months [Zechariah 7; 8:19]),5 was a suitable backdrop for composing, or perhaps compiling, lamentations in order to fill certain emotional and ritual needs, such as a book of lamentations. 6 It is not my contention that the lamentation genre was established during this time. It had clearly been in existence since ancient times, as is evident in the Mesopotamian and biblical literatures, both of which contain personal and public lamentations.7 I do maintain that historical circumstances can play a significant role in encouraging the widespread adoption of one kind of writing over another, and that the upheavals and uncertainty of this period, the sixth century b.c.e., promoted the genre of the hidden polemic. I take this opportunity to reexamine the stories, in which I have found hidden polemics, from a chronological point of view and to reveal the common denominator that most, or all, of them share: they date from the sixth century b.c.e. on. But, since the phrase “hidden polemic” is often used, but not always with the same meaning, I begin with a short presentation of my classification and definition of biblical polemics, focusing on two issues: first, to shed light very briefly on biblical literature as a polemical literature and on its common types of polemic, so as to clarify the background of the phenomenon of the hidden polemic;8 second, to point out stories containing hidden polemic and show the sixth century b.c.e. as a fertile ground for it. All of this estab
5. For an analysis of the prophecies of the fasts in Zechariah and the conclusion “that the prophecy also attested to the . . . reality of the early Second Temple period,” see Hoffman’s essay in this volume (pp. 169–213); the citation is taken from p. 205. Hoffman suggests that we examine these prophecies in Zechariah “to see whether its purpose was to anchor the Destruction of the First Temple in the collective memory of the returnees to Zion. . . . [T]he fashioning of this collective memory was bound up with disputes about differing goals and interests. Consequently, traditions had to have been established in a gradual fashion, after many transformations” (p. 208). 6. On relating the book of Lamentations to the sixth century, see for example, Westermann 1994: 54–56; Renkema 1998: 54–57; and see also Provan (1991: 7–19), who dates the book to between the sixth and the second centuries b.c.e. 7. An example of an old Israelite lament is the poem on the death of Saul and Jonathan (2 Sam 1:17–27), which the author of Samuel states was taken from an earlier book entitled The Book of Jashar. On old Sumerian laments, see Jacobsen 1987: 447–84. 8. My book on this subject is available, so a reader looking for a fuller description can find it (Amit 2000).

The Sixth Century and the Growth of Hidden Polemics 137
lishes my working assumption that the upheavals and uncertainty of this period promoted the genre of hidden polemic.
Biblical Polemics: A General View
The reader of biblical literature is accustomed to polemic, since by its very nature it is a polemical literature. Stephen Geller’s statement about biblical religion, “It is a minority faith, a protest, and, as such, essentially polemical,”9 is clearly borne out by the greater part of the biblical literature. The polemical topics that appear in the Hebrew Bible typically deal with the questions that preoccupied the minds and beliefs of contemporary people. These include, for example: the concept of the deity, his ways of ruling the world, the nature of the relationship between God and his believers, the appropriate ways to worship God, who Israel is, the nature of Israel’s bond with the land, what constitutes good leadership, and what its rights and functions should be. These and other issues lie at the heart of the Hebrew Bible as polemical literature. In other words, reading the Bible as a reflection of an emerging culture that was struggling to find a unique and innovative identity explains why polemics flourished as they did, both in contemporary life and in its literature. Obviously, it is the latter category, the literary polemic, that is still with us today, and there is no dispute about the explicit and implicit polemics present in the various genres—in the stories, in the law, and the prophetic literature, or indeed in the genres of psalms and wisdom. I propose to focus on biblical narratives, where I have discovered the phenomenon of hidden polemics. The two common types of polemic are the open and the indirect, or in other words, the explicit and the implicit. A polemic is considered open when its subject is stated explicitly, such as the stand taken on a matter—that is, when there is no need for conjecture in trying to elicit the subject. An explicit position is expressed either by the narrator or in the speech of one of the trustworthy characters in the story.10 Encountering this clear position, the reader does not need to guess at the tone of the words, whether approving or critical and condemnatory. An example of an explicit polemic is the story of the marriage of Isaac to Rebekah (Genesis 24). Right at the start the reader is presented
9. Geller 1996: 4. 10. On the question of reliability, see Amit 2001: 93–101.



138 Yairah Amit
with an unequivocal stand on the open issue, the marriage to Canaanite women: such marriage is utterly and completely prohibited (24:3). This prohibition becomes a critical factor in the development of the plot, which begins with the quest to bring a woman “from there” and ends with bringing Rebekah from the family of Nahor, the brother of Abraham, to be a wife to Isaac.11 A polemic is considered indirect, or implied, when its subject is open but the attitude toward it is expressed indirectly—that is, not in explicit statements made by the narrator or one of the trustworthy characters but by means of story elements—for example, the plot, the order of events, the nature of the characters, the analogies, the literary style, and so on. The story of Ruth is a case in point, representing an indirect polemic on the subject of marriage to foreign women. The issue of the polemic is explicit: can a Moabite woman find refuge under the wings of the Lord, the God of Israel, and become part of the Israelite nation (Ruth 2:12)? The answer to this question is not given explicitly. The reader deduces the author’s position only indirectly, as the story progresses: through Ruth’s marriage to Boaz and the birth of Obed; through the description of the heroine’s personality as a model for disengagement from foreign roots and a perfect integration into Israelite society; through the analogies to such characters as Abraham (2:11), Leah (4:11), Rachel (4:11), and Tamar (4:12) and the contrast with Orpah, who turned back (1:14–18); through the almost obsessive reference to Ruth’s Moabite or foreign ancestry (1:4, 15–16, 22; 2:1, 6, 10–12, 21; 4:5, 10); and through other devices. All of these serve to cast a positive light on the acceptance of Ruth “the Moabite” as part of Israel. To achieve this, the God of Israel (who blesses the marriage to Ruth with offspring) and King David (the later offspring of this union) are marshaled in support of this position.12
What Is a Hidden Polemic?
A polemic is said to be hidden when its subject is not stated explicitly or when it is not stated in the usual or expected manner or word
11. According to Westermann (1986: 384), the reworking of Genesis 24 into its present form reflects a relatively late period. Van Seters (1975: 240–48, 277–78), who emphasizes divine providence, assigns the story to J, which was composed in the sixth century b.c.e. Rofé (1990), on the basis of linguistic, legal, theological, and literary aspects, dates the story to the fifth century b.c.e. 12. On the late date of the book of Ruth, the end of the sixth century b.c.e., see Brenner 1988: 153–57.



The Sixth Century and the Growth of Hidden Polemics 139
ing. The reader senses through various clues or signs that the text is the scene of a struggle between two opposing impulses: to hide the polemical issue and avoid stating it outright, but at the same time to leave a trail of clues. These clues signal the readers, jolt them in the process of reading,13 and direct their attention to the presence of the hidden polemical issue. The position taken in these texts may be made directly or indirectly, but it always relates to a hidden issue, and so it can only be evaluated later—that is, after the issue has been discovered. The discovery of the issue is therefore an essential precondition that gives meaning to the author’s position.14 The use of the technique of hidden polemic could serve rhetorical needs and the need for concealment. From the rhetorical point of view, it could help to remove any potential opposition to a polemical opinion that would arise if it were stated openly, and, furthermore, it forces the reader to figure out the reason for avoiding explicit discussion of the subject. At certain times, due to the special sensitivity of the subject and the fear of hostile response, open polemic was suppressed and the issue was driven underground.15 This was especially important in regard to the polemics of the sixth century b.c.e.
Examples of Hidden Polemic and Its Relation to the Sixth Century
To make things clearer, I will present a few examples, beginning with the one that first alerted me to the phenomenon of the hidden polemic: the story of Micah, who built a shrine in the hill country of Ephraim (Judges 17–18).16
Bethel
This story is full of place-names. Readers are told on three occasions that the Levite traveled to Micah from Bethlehem, Judah (17:7, 8, and 9).
13. Aristotle (Rhetoric [trans. W. R. Roberts and I. Bywater; New York, 1954] 3.2: 1404b) recognized the phenomenon of alienation or enstrangement, in the sense of making strange: “People do not feel towards strangers as they do towards their own countrymen, and the same thing is true of their feeling for language. It is therefore well to give to everyday speech an unfamiliar air; people like what strikes them, and are struck by what is out of the way.” This subject was developed in literary theory; see Shklovsky 1965. 14. On the definition of hidden polemic and its restrictions, see Amit 2000: 93–98. 15. See Amit 2000: 97–98, 250. 16. I first dealt with this story in 1990, and lately in my book on hidden polemics, 2000: 99–129.



140 Yairah Amit
They know that the men sent by the Danites to spy out the land had set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, which are also mentioned three times in the story (18:2, 8, 11), and also that the spies were headed for Laish, which was “far from the Sidonians in the valley that liew by Bethrehob,” which would later be renamed Dan (18:7, 14, 27, 29). We are even told the name of the place where the Danite tribe camped before they reached Micah’s house—at “Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why that place is called ‘the Camp of Dan’ to this day” (18:12). Yet, despite all of this, the readers do not know the name of the place where Micah himself lived, though his house is the setting for most of the scenes in this story. Four times in the course of the story it is stated that Micah’s house was in the hill country of Ephraim (17:1, 8 ; 18:2, 13),17 and readers must wonder why the narrator was content to name the area but not the specific location. We are left with the curious picture of Micah’s house standing in splendid isolation on top of a mountain in the hill country of Ephraim—clearly a wrong impression, since the text later mentions that there were other houses there besides Micah’s (18:22). Obviously it was part of a village, or even a town. Considering that it is not the biblical narrator’s habit to omit place-names in this manner, especially not in this story, we can only conclude that the absence of the place-names was not accidental but was done deliberately to give the reader a clue and to alert him to the fact that something is amiss. The reader who senses this anomaly or enstrangement will naturally try to account for it and perhaps speculate about the precise location of Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. The hunt for such indications unearths some more clues that point to Bethel, of which I will mention two: the Hebrew phrase “house of God,” without a definite article or possessive form but, as stated in Judg 17:5, “and the man Micah had a house of God,” appears only twice more in biblical narrative. The passage in which both references appear is precisely the story that establishes the ancient sanctity of Bethel and explains its name as meaning God’s abode, where a house of God would be established: “This is none other than a house of God . . . and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house” (Gen 28:17, 22).18 It seems, there
17. In the kjv the place is called “Mount Ephraim,” an exact translation of the Hebrew text. However, as “Mount Ephraim,” it is the name of a hilly region, not a specific mountain. This area, for a small country such as Israel, is fairly large. Thus, I prefer the translation “the hill country of Ephraim,” as in the nrsv, njpsv, and other versions. 18. Out of the 97 times that the phrase “house of God” appears in the Hebrew Bible, it appears only 6 times without a definite article or possesive form, and 3 of them are in poetical texts. The other 3 times are in the context of Bethel.



The Sixth Century and the Growth of Hidden Polemics 141
fore, that the use of the phrase “house of God,” which is the etiology of Bethel, in a context referring to the hill country of Ephraim and to the setting up of an image, may well have been designed to hint at a link with the shrine of Bethel. Another clue is the connection of Bethel with the city of Dan, which was a center of religious worship in the Northern Kingdom (1 Kgs 12:28–30; 2 Kgs 10:29). Similarly, in our story, the shrine in the hill country of Ephraim is directly linked to the shrine of Dan, because the ritual objects and the priest of Micah’s shrine were transferred to Dan. In my opinion, these three clues, and others I have not listed,19 are enough to confirm that the author was hinting at Bethel but preferred to avoid naming it. We may, therefore, conclude that in this story Bethel is the object of a hidden polemic. The existence of a hidden polemic does not prevent us from finding yet other polemics in the same story (Judges 17–18). For example, this story also contains an open promonarchy polemic, presenting the monarchy as the only way to avoid the situation where “every man did that which was right in his own eyes.” Also present is an indirect polemic against the city of Dan and its cult: its name is openly mentioned in the clearest way (18:29). However, it is not openly condemned but only indirectly, by a critical description of the way it was established and maintained. By contrast, Bethel is not mentioned by name but has a “house of God,” and, as we have seen, it is closely linked to Dan. The task of uncovering hidden polemics should be constrained by a number of considerations, to avoid finding polemics to suit the needs of the interested or modern reader where none was intended by the writer. In addition to the absence of an explicit reference to the polemical subject, the considerations should be as follows:
a. The discovery of a hidden polemic must be supported by cumulative evidence, a series of clues that converge on one point, the hidden subject of the polemic. In most cases one clue is not enough.20 b. The subject of the polemic should also be a polemical issue in other biblical texts. Bethel, as we know, is a controversial subject throughout biblical literature. Amos and Hosea condemn it,21 as

In the story of Micah, for example, I found no fewer than 7. See n. 16 above. 21. Amos 3:14; 4:4; 5:5; cf. 7:10, 13; Hosea calls the city “Beth-aven” (House of Iniquity): 4:15; 5:8; 10:5; cf. 10:8. On the possibility that the denomination “Beth-aven” originally had a positive connotation, see Naaaman 1985: 16 and n. 10 there.

does the book of Kings,22 while in the book of Genesis it is a holy place.23 The prophecy of Jeremiah (48:13) also refers to Bethel pejoratively as a cultic symbol of Northern Israel. c. Finally, the commentator is advised to find evidence of the hidden subject of the polemic in the tradition of interpretation. If the polemic is so hidden that it escaped the notice of commentators through the ages, perhaps it exists not in the text but only in the commentator’s imagination. In the case of the story of Micah, the Sages already identified Micah with Nebat, the father of Jeroboam I who built the calf (b. Sanh. 101b; compare Rashi on 103b). According to Midr. Tan ̇uma, it was Micah who made the calf during the wandering in the wilderness (ki Tisa 19). In the Alphabet of Ben Sira, Micah is identified with the old prophet from Bethel; and according to Rashi, Micah also took part in the conquest of Bethel in Judg 1:22. Needless to say, there are modern scholars, from Halevi at the end of the nineteenth century to Naaaman today, who link the hill country of Ephraim in this story with Bethel.24
The question remains why Bethel was suppressed and is never named in the entire story. To my mind, the answer has to do with the status of the city, which had an ancient sacred tradition, was the site of a royal shrine, and retained its importance and centrality after the fall of Samaria (2 Kgs 17:28) and apparently after the reform of Josiah and the fall of Jerusalem.25 In other words, Bethel was a subject of polemic because of its potential as an alternative to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was perceived as the exclusive site of the worship of God (from the days of Josiah onward), there was no problem about openly condemning Bethel. But less than 40 years later, when the status of Jerusalem became uncertain, while Bethel continued to serve as a ritual center for the worship of God, there were those who prudently took their antiBethel polemic underground, preferring the technique of the hidden polemic. However, there were others who emphasized the traditions

that made Bethel holy (as in the book of Genesis), and still others chose to condemn it explicitly (the book of Kings).26
Jerusalem
The absence of the mention of the name Jerusalem anywhere in the entire Torah literature is curious, especially since there are numerous opportunities to mention it. For instance, it should have been possible to name Jerusalem as a Jebusite city alongside other foreign cities, such as Hivite Shechem (Gen 12:6; 33:18–19; 34; 35:4; 37:12–13; see also 48:22), Hittite Hebron (Gen 13:18; 23; 35:27; 37:14), and Canaanite Bethel, known by its previous name, Luz (Gen 28:19, 35:6; see also 12:8; 13:3; 31:13; 35:1, 3, 7–8, 15–16), and other sites through which the Patriarchs passed and sometimes named and sanctified as places of worship. Mount Zion might have been mentioned, as were Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal (Deut 11:29–30; 24:4, 12–13), as one of the places that the Israelites were destined to reach, to pass through, or at least to see from afar. Even in the book of Deuteronomy, Jerusalem could have been named as the future exclusive center of worship, and so on. In other words, the Torah’s silence on the subject of Jerusalem is remarkable if not astonishing.27 But this silence is not accidental, as we learn from certain allusions to Jerusalem in the Torah literature. The first allusion occurs in a hidden polemic embedded in the description of the meeting between Abram and Melchizedek, king of Salem (Gen 14:18–20). This narrative unit, which most scholars believe was inserted at a later period, does not mention Jerusalem by name but hints at it by means of various clues.28 Among these clues are: the name Salem, which is a component
26. In my previous writings on this subject (see n. 16 above), I argued that the hidden polemic against Bethel took place as early as the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the seventh—after the fall of Samaria and before Josiah’s reform. Now I am convinced that the background of this hidden polemic was the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of its Temple. Moreover, it is possible to propose that, in the older versions of this story, Bethel was mentioned explicitly and that its name became hidden when the status of Jerusalem was upset. See also Schwartz 1985, his approach to chaps. 31–32 in the book of Jubilees, and his interpretation of the status of Bethel and its cultic priority as an alternative to Jerusalem in the time of the Second Temple. See also Blenkinsopp 1998: 27–37. 27. On this silence and the attempts to explain it, see Amit 2000: 130–68. 28. Already medieval commentators such as Rashi and others noted the fragmentary nature of this passage. Most modern commentators view it as an interpolation; see the full discussion in Emerton 1971, 1990.

of the name Jeru-salem and appears as its poetic parallel name in Ps 76:3; the element Zedek (‘justice’ in Hebrew) in the king’s name, which appears in the name of Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, in Josh 10:1 and 3, and represents the ideal of all the Judean kings of the city and at the same time alludes to the dynasty of the Zadok priests (2 Sam 8:17; 1 Kgs 1:26, 32–40, 44–45, and more); the mention of the Valley of the King, which is known as a place near Jerusalem (2 Sam 18:18), as the meeting-place of Abram and Melchizedek; and more.29 The second allusion appears as an addendum to the story of the sacrifice of Isaac: “whence the present saying, ‘On the mount of the Lord there is vision’ ” (Gen 22:14b, njpsv).30 In other words, the story of the sacrifice originally contained no hidden reference to Jerusalem at all. Abraham walks for three days (Gen 22:4), which may be a typological number and does not necessarily indicate the distance from Beersheba to Jerusalem, and then sees the place from afar. Moreover, nowhere is it said that he headed north, in the direction of Jerusalem. We must also distinguish between the intertextual treatment of the author of the late book of Chronicles, who interpreted the phrase “land of Moriah” in Gen 22:2 as “Mount Moriah,” the Temple Mount in Jerusalem (2 Chr 3:1), and the story of the binding itself, which does not hint at Jerusalem except in the comment by the later editor or reader: “whence the present saying, ‘On the mount of the Lord there is vision’ ” (v. 14b). The third allusion is in the book of Deuteronomy, which refers to Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim by name (Deut 11:26–30; 27; compare Josh 8:30–35) but carefully avoids mentioning the Temple Mount. It is reasonable to assume that the repeated use of the phrase in Deuteronomy, “the place that the Lord your God shall choose,” in the postJosiah period, is an implied reference to Jerusalem—yet notably only an allusion, not an explicit reference. It would appear, therefore, that the editors of the book of Deuteronomy were anxious to avoid too strong of an association with the city while its destiny still hung in the balance, its political and economic situation was unstable, and it was still the object of harsh criticism.31 This anxiety is especially marked in the genre of law, which was supposed to mold reality and establish which principle was more important: the principle of cult centralization or

The Sixth Century and the Growth of Hidden Polemics 145
the place of centralized worship, Jerusalem. The legislator in the book of Deuteronomy was clearly interested above all in the centralization of worship, leaving Jerusalem as an option. He therefore used very generalized wording, “the place that the Lord your God shall choose,” which indicates nowhere in particular. By only implying that this phrase referred to Jerusalem, he left open other interpretations, in accordance with changing trends and historical circumstances. The legislator of Deuteronomy thereby declared the paramount theological principle, the centralization of worship, and left it to the vagaries of history to choose the site. A final allusion to Jerusalem in the Torah may be found in Moses’ blessing of the tribe of Benjamin (Deut 33:12): “Beloved of the Lord, he rests securely beside Him; ever does He protect him, as he rests between his shoulders.” According to most commentators, the blessing alludes to Jerusalem, but I do not count it as a hidden polemic, since the language here is poetic. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the absence of the city’s name in this passage complements and conforms with the general tendency to avoid its name and aids the hidden polemic on Jerusalem throughout the Torah literature. The tension in the Torah literature between the systematic silence and the presence of certain allusions shows that avoiding the mention of Jerusalem was not accidental. In all probability, the destruction of the city and the Temple by the Babylonians (in 586 b.c.e.) gave rise to bitter disappointment and deepened the doubts about the preference of Jerusalem over all other cities and the exclusive status that had originated in its liberation from the siege of Sennacherib. In the reality of the sixth century b.c.e., when Mizpah and Bethel reasserted their positions, it would have been ironic to refer to Jerusalem as the preferred city. After the downfall of 586 b.c.e., the city lost its central status, the criticism leveled against it had grown, disillusionment set in, and the scene was set for considering alternative cities with a holy tradition.32 Thus, the Torah literature—while noting the special and fragile bond between the people of Israel and their land, and describing the exile both as an option for temporary refuge in times of famine and as a form of punishment that secured the continued existence of the nation in exile—this literature did not shirk from ignoring Jerusalem on the one hand, and presenting other cities as holy, on the other hand. In so doing, it tacitly communicated to its readers and believers the preeminent holiness of the people and their continued existence as a

God-worshiping nation, in preference to clinging to one particular site or another or to historical circumstances that might change with time.
Saul of Gibeah
The sixth century was also an appropriate time for criticizing the Jerusalem-based regime that had failed its people. The book of Kings places the responsibility and blame for the destruction of Judea on the house of David. But there were other voices that depicted the dynasty whose roots were in Bethlehem in a positive light, by condemning the dynasty whose roots were in the town of Gibeah, in the land of Benjamin. It seems that this theme—condemning Saul in favor of Davidalso preoccupied the author of the much later work, the book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 10).33 In any event, chaps. 19 through 21 of the book of Judges (which in the opinion of many is a later work34) present an explicit polemic against the town of Gibeah and the tribe of Benjamin, and an implicit polemic against the king whose roots lay in Gibeah of Benjamin. It is no accident that the Levite cuts up the body of the concubine into twelve parts (Judg 19:29), as if he is prefiguring the action of Saul, who would later cut up a yoke of oxen (1 Sam 11:7). Nor is it an accident that Jabesh-Gilead (Judg 21:1–15), which is depicted as an outsider, proved loyal to Saul (1 Sam 31:11–13; 2 Sam 21:12–14; 1 Chr 10:11–12). 35 This polemic probably served needs and interests that emerged in the sixth century, after the downfall of the house of David, and the rising status of the Benjaminite region after the fall of Jerusalem.36
The Northern Population
Another continuing polemic born out of the circumstances following the exile concerns the attitude toward the inhabitants of Samaria after the fall of the Northern Kingdom. We find unequivocal positions on this issue, rejecting any association with the Northern population, in 2 Kgs 17:24–41 and in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
33. 1 Chronicles 10, especially vv. 13–14, has the clearest and most intensive blame, but see also 1 Chr 11:2; 12:1–2, 24; 13:3. 34. See lately Blenkinsopp 1998; and in this volume, pp. 98–99. 35.

The Sixth Century and the Growth of Hidden Polemics 147
Certain indications or signs in Genesis 34—for example, the choice of the multiethnic Shechem as background to the incident of rape, the reference to the majority of the local population as Hivite,37 the relations of minority and majority, the motif of circumcision, which became an identifying sign of Judaism in the time of the Second Temple, and others38—lead me to consider this chapter a hidden polemic against the people who would later be known as Samaritans, though they are not described in this story as the Northern population. Thus, the open polemic reflects a struggle against marriage with the prince of Shechem and his people, but the hidden polemic concerns the inhabitants of the Northern province. This, as we know, ties in with the problematic relationship with the Northern populations that was one of the central issues facing the Judeans in the early days of the Second Temple, from the sixth century on.39 A hidden polemic with the opposite intention is found in the book of Chronicles, where the Northern population appears as an integral part of the people of Israel, who must not be regarded as a separate entity.40 So we should not be surprised that the Northern exile (720 b.c.e.) is described in Chronicles as consisting primarily of inhabitants from Transjordan (1 Chr 5:26); or that Hezekiah sent runners “throughout Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan” (2 Chr 30:5) to invite all the people, including those of the North, to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 30), as though they had not been exiled by the Assyrians. These and other signs are part of the hidden polemic of the Chronicler, implying that those “who dwell in Samaria” (Ezra 4:17) are in his eyes an integral part of the people of Israel.
The Seemingly Hidden Polemic
As well as hidden polemics, there are some polemics that only seem to be hidden. While the subject is not stated explicitly, the references to
37. Hivites were allowed to take part in worship; see Joshua 9, where the covenant with the Hivites was attained by means of deceit. 38. See Amit 2000: 189–211. 39. The book of Jubilees (30:1–26), which contains a polemic on the subject of marriage to foreigners; the Testament of Levi (7:2); Ben Sira (50:25–26)—all allude to the Samaritans. See also Kugel 1992: 23–25. And Genesis 34 served the debate against the Samaritans. 40. See Japhet 1989: 325–51 and there the review and the bibliography of the different approaches by scholars.

148 Yairah Amit
it are too obvious to be overlooked. An example of this type of polemic is the story of the creation in Gen 1:1–2:4a.41 The observation of the Sabbath is another polemical subject that appeared on the public agenda toward the end of the First Temple era and thereafter, as shown in the prophecies of Jeremiah (17:19–27), and, notably, in Ezekiel (20:11–24; 22:8, 26; 23:38; 44:24; 45:17; 46:1–5, 12), and the later Isaiah (56:2–6; 58:13; 66:23), as well as in the later historiography (Neh 9:14; 10:32; 13:15–22). There is no doubt that the story of the creation, which consecrates the seventh day and, without mentioning the Sabbath, takes a clear stand in the polemic on the Sabbath. God is shown “creating” the Sabbath as a day of rest and as the basis for a distinctive calendar, based neither on the moon nor on the sun but on the deeds of God. Thus, showing that God himself rested on this day suggested imitatio deithat is, a clear, categorical position on the subject of the holy and blessed Sabbath. All this was accomplished without once mentioning the word. In my opinion we cannot overlook the absence of the term “Sabbath” in Gen 1:1–2:4a. Yet, when we understand that this is a deliberate omission, we recognize a facet of the polemic of this text and the rhetoric of the argument, which together give the story of the creation greater depth and significance. History has shown to what extent the commandment to observe the Sabbath played a central role in the conditions of the Diaspora.42 It provided the Israelites with a common denominator: a new calendar for Sabbath-keepers, to help them distinguish themselves from their social surroundings. The Sabbath became a crucial factor in the preservation of the national identity. Furthermore, it was possible to practice it independently of the Temple. Diachronic observation leads us to conclude that the destruction of the Temple and the Babylonian exile accelerated the perception of the Sabbath as having central importance to Israelite society and thus being a polemical subject worthy of introducing the Torah literature.
Conclusion
In view of all the above examples, I conclude as I began: the upheavals and uncertainties of the sixth century b.c.e. set the scene for the

growing use of hidden polemics during this period. There may have been several reasons for the use of this poetics or technique: unease about dealing with a particular subject in an open or direct way; the thought that the indirect approach is more effective; even the wish to compel the reader to figure out the reason for avoiding an explicit mention of the expected subject. In any case, it is interesting to see that writers in the epoch of the sixth century b.c.e. frequently chose this genre.

Gibeon and the Gibeonites Revisited
Diana Edelman
University of Sheffield
In 1973, Peter Kearny noted a strong anti-Gibeonite bias that pervades the Deuteronomistic History, but he was unable to propose a rationale for the attitude (Kearny 1973: 1–19). A year later, J. Blenkinsopp pointed out what seems to have been a deliberate attempt in the books of Samuel to disassociate Saul from Gibeon, the site of his probable capital, in part by referring obliquely to the locale as “the hill” (Blenkinsopp 1974: 1–7). In this essay, I will suggest that the history of Gibeon during the Neo-Babylonian and early Persian periods provides the key for understanding the origin of the anti-Gibeonite bias in the History, which scholars agree was either written or heavily edited during one of these two periods. The politics and dynastic rivalries that were prominent at the time during which the Deuteronomistic Historian or editor was writing were what influenced his disguising of Gibeon as Saul’s capital and his negative portrayal of the Gibeonites.
The Archaeological Evidence
Gibeon, modern el-Jîb, was excavated in five seasons between 1956 and 1962 by James B. Pritchard (1993: 512). Approximately 8–10% of the total intramural site was dug. In addition, extramural tombs were excavated. Since the site was occupied at the time of the excavations (and continues to be occupied today), the area available for excavation was limited. Most of the area uncovered was in the northeast quadrant of the site. It included the pool and the areas immediately joining it, which contained, on the one hand, part of the city wall system, and on the other, a number of below-ground storage vats or cellars. Diagnostic
Author’s note: This article is a slightly revised version of a paper with the same title presented at the 2001 Annual ASOR Meeting in Boulder, Colorado. I want to thank O. Lipschits for inviting me to include it in the present volume. I attended the initial conference for which the majority of the papers in the volume were written and have benefited greatly from numerous points made there and issues discussed; they have influenced my current understandings directly and indirectly.

ceramics, some with inscriptions, were recovered from the fill inside the pool and from debris inside a number of the underground chambers but, since they were not from stratified contexts, they are of limited use for recreating the stratigraphy needed to understand the occupational phases of the site. Further complications include trenches dug on the site in 1917, when el-Jîb served as a bastion of Turkish resistance, as well as damage done by British shelling from across the valley at Nebi Samwîl, during their attempt to rout the rebels (Pritchard 1962: 87–88). The history of Gibeon in the sixth century b.c.e., our focal century, is difficult to piece together from the excavations. There are no destruction layers in the Iron I or Iron II periods (Pritchard 1962: 161), making the identification of strata and phases more difficult. The lack of clear ceramic diagnostics for the sixth century even today makes the separation and identification of Neo-Babylonian occupation from late monarchic and early Persian occupation extremely problematic. Debates continue over the dating of the inscribed materials from the pool and the purpose of the below-ground storage areas as well, which have repercussions for understanding the history of the site. The lack of any destruction layer indicates that the site was not destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 b.c.e., when Judah was incorporated into the expanding empire. Evidence for ongoing occupation during the sixth century b.c.e. is provided by various artifactual remains. First, Pritchard admits that there are some pottery forms that may be dated as late as the end of the sixth century on the basis of parallels from Tell Beit Mirsim but concludes that they are limited in number and so do not represent a major occupation at the site (Pritchard 1964: 39).1 The published pottery with reed impressions found in the “Israelite” buildings in Area 17 has been identified by E. Stern (1982: 33, 13336) and O. Lipschits (1999: 176) as characteristic of the sixth century. Second, Neo-Babylonian occupation is probably indicated by the MWÍH-stamped jar handles that were recovered from the fill in the pool (Pritchard 1959: 27), from cellar 136 in Area 17, and from the unstratified debris of a house area in 17-H-19 (Pritchard 1964: 29). The dating of these handles has been problematic because of their failure to
1. In spite of Pritchard’s failure to identify a Persian stratum at Gibeon, P. Lapp noted that the dump contains plenty of Persian-era pottery, “from which several Palestinian archaeologists have gathered their teaching collections for the Persian period” (Lapp 1968: 392). However, C. Carter has pointed out Lapp’s own tendency to call exilic pottery Persian, which has resulted in an over-exaggeration of Pritchard’s failure to identify actual Persian-era pottery (Carter 1999: 121 n. 26).

be recovered from secure contexts during excavations conducted prior to 1962. J. Zorn, J. Yellin, and J. Hayes have argued that the geographical distribution of these stamped jars, which currently is limited to the region of Benjamin and northernmost Judah, suggests a date in the Neo-Babylonian period (Zorn, Yellin, and Hayes 1994: 161–83). Until their study, the stamps had commonly been assigned to the Persian period without firm corroborating stratigraphic proof (for the history of the discussion, see Stern 1982: 207–9). O. Lipschits has accepted them as indicators of the Neo-Babylonian era (Lipschits 1999: 176). The use of Aramaic script on the MWÍH-stamped handles does not help identify the period of their use. While Aramaic became the lingua franca of the Persian Empire and developed a particular form, Imperial Aramaic, as a result of its use for Persian bureaucratic purposes in royal and satrapal directives (Kuhrt 1995: 699), Aramaic had already had a long history of use in the Assyrian Empire and probably had continued into the Neo-Babylonian period. Its use as a spoken and written language among the large population forming the Aramaean states in Syria and upper Mesopotamia that had begun to be incorporated into the Assyrian Empire as early as the late tenth century b.c.e. (Kuhrt 1995: 398) made it a logical second language for correspondence in the empire. In addition, its simplified alphabet made it an easy written language to master. By the eighth century b.c.e., Aramaicisms had appeared in Assyrian (Kuhrt 1995: 398), and records of certain events or transactions were being kept bilingually. A bas relief depicts two scribes of Tiglathpileser III (ca. 744–727 b.c.e.) taking dictation, one using a reed stylus on a clay tablet and the other using a reed pen on a scroll (Saggs 1995: 141). In addition, a cuneiform letter sent to this king from an official in Tyre mentioned that it was accompanied by a sealed Aramaic document, while another cuneiform document written about the same time refers to a palace scribe’s receiving a roll of papyrus, presumably for the purpose of writing Aramaic (Saggs 1995: 142). By the mid–seventh century, cuneiform documents mention the frequent use of Aramean scribes as witnesses; one dated 697 b.c.e. denotes a person with an Aramaic name as “palace scribe” (Saggs 1995: 142). Weights from Nimrud from the mid–seventh century are marked with Aramaic characters (Saggs 1995: 142). Since both Hebrew and Aramaic were Northwest Semitic languages, Aramaic was the logical choice for the Assyrians and Babylonians to use in official business dealings and diplomacy in Israel and Judah. Hebrew was much closer to Aramaic than to East Semitic Assyrian or

Babylonian, and the two states had a history of writing in the alphabetic script on papyrus. The portrayal of the desire of the city officials to use Aramaic to negotiate with the Assyrian officials on site during the siege of Jerusalem in 701 b.c.e. rather than Hebrew, to limit the understanding of the people (2 Kgs 18:17–37), shows that Aramaic had already become the spoken and written language of diplomacy. This use undoubtedly continued in the Neo-Babylonian period, making it the logical choice as the official lingua franca by the Persians after 538 b.c.e., when they took control of the Babylonian Empire. At this point, Aramaic was spoken and written from Iran to Egypt, inclusively (Saggs 1995: 142). In light of the foregoing sketch of the history of the use of Aramaic as a diplomatic and business language, the use of Aramaic script to create the MWÍH stamps in Judah/Yehud cannot be used to argue for their belonging to a Persian administrative system as opposed to a Babylonian one. It is highly likely that Aramaic would have been used for official business in the area after 586 b.c.e., when the Babylonians incorporated the area into their empire. More problematic is the suggestion of C. Carter (1999: 120–21), apparently accepted by O. Lipschits (1999: 174–75), to date the jar handles from the pool fill inscribed with private names or seals to the NeoBabylonian period, as evidence of a flourishing wine industry in the area under the Babylonians. N. Avigad had previously voiced this idea as a logical re-creation of the historical situation if one favored a sixthcentury setting for the handles (1972: 8–9). However, the date of these handles is disputed both paleographically and typologically. Only the necks and upper portions of the shoulders of the jars have been preserved, so the shape of the whole vessel on which the names were inscribed remains uncertain. In addition, their recovery from the pool fill means there is no clear stratigraphic context that can provide clues for their dating. On paleographic grounds, W. F. Albright (1960: 37), F. M. Cross (1962: 23), and G. E. Wright (1963: 210–11), all of the Albright school, have suggested a sixth-century date, while N. Avigad (1959: 132), A. Demsky (1971: 23), and A. Lemaire (private communication) have proposed a late-eighth/early-seventh-century date contemporary with the many lmlk stamps also found in the fill. Typological arguments cannot help resolve the dispute any more than paleographical ones can. According to R. Amiran, the closest parallel to the postulated jar type is a vessel found in a tomb from the early sixth century b.c.e. at Beth-shean, leading her to date the vessels at Gibeon to the Neo-Babylonian period (Amiran 1975: 132). She notes



Gibeon and the Gibeonites Revisited 157
a long history of development for the form, however, which she traces back to the tenth–ninth centuries in examples from Megiddo V and Beth-shemesh III. In her opinion, the type also existed in the eighthseventh centuries b.c.e. in examples from Megiddo III–II and Bethshemesh IIc, which would not rule out the earlier date, approximately 701 b.c.e. (Amiran 1975: 129–32). N. Avigad (1972: 8 n. 7) pointed out that this jar type was missing from all late preexilic sites, including Ramat Ra ̇el, Ein-gedi, and Arad. Since that time, only one possible example of the jar has been found (Lipschits 1999: 175 n. 37): at Tel Batash, in the destruction debris on the floor of building 950 of Str. II, a seventh-century level that was destroyed between 605 and 603 b.c.e. by the Babylonians (Mazar and Panitz-Cohen 2001: pl. 49:6, Amphora 3). The excavators acknowledge that the upper part of the vessel closely resembles the shape of the spout and handles of the inscribed jars from the pool fill at Gibeon, but they consider the closest parallel to their new find to be an amphora from Megiddo III–II (Lamon and Shipton 1939: pl. 10:39). The uncertainty of the jar type makes proposed parallels tentative and any conclusions about its period of use based on typology premature. The date and function of the underground storage areas that were cut into the limestone bedrock in the open area immediately adjoining the pool are likewise under dispute. Pritchard (1964: 1–27) identified them as wine cellars and dated their use to the monarchic period; O. Lipschits (1999: 173) has accepted their function as cellars but has connected them with a proposed Neo-Babylonian wine industry, while P. Lapp (1968: 391–93) proposed, on the basis of parallels from Tell el-Óesi, Tell el-Fûl, and Tell en-Naßbeh, that they were originally grain silos that were secondarily used to store various consumables kept in jars. Most of the areas were not plastered and were waterpermeable (Pritchard 1964: 9), making it unlikely they were used to store grain directly; only foodstuffs stored in sealed containers would have escaped rotting in these underground chambers (Pritchard 1964: 25). The retrieval of funnels from the pool fill (Pritchard 1962: fig. 23) in addition to the jars handles with Gibeon and the names of private individuals strengthens the likelihood that wine was produced locally as a commodity, making cellars for jar fermentation and storage desirable. However, there is no way to prove that all the underground storage areas were used exclusively for wine storage; they could have held a number of commodities stored in jars in addition to wine. Evidence of continuing occupation at Gibeon in the Persian period is provided by two animal-figure stamps from the fill of the pool



158 Diana Edelman
(Pritchard 1961: fig. 46, #556 and #533). One stamp depicts a lion rearing up on its hind legs, with a stylized fire altar symbol or spade above its tail in the upper left-hand corner (#556). The other depicts a lion in profile, on all fours, facing right, with an uplifted tail (#533). Pritchard gave no definitive date for seal #556 but assigned seal #533 to the end of Iron Age II on the basis of its similarity to an impression found at Ramat Ra ̇el alongside a royal seal impression (Pritchard 1961: 20). The nine seals from season two at Ramat Ra ̇el were found on top of the stone-paved courtyard of the Iron II fortress or in pits cut into the surface. They were intermixed with refuse that included limited amounts of late Persian and Hellenistic pottery and 35 YHWD stamps. The area appears to have served as a rubbish dump for the Persian-era and Hellenistic settlement, the location of which has not been pinpointed but that probably lay farther south (Aharoni 1962: 5, 10, 28, 34). It is now known that both seal types belong to a series of such seals that have been found at sites in Yehud and at Shechem (Stern 1982: 211). Stern suggests a date for this style of seal in the Persian period: the end of the sixth century through the fifth century b.c.e. (Stern 1982: 210). Less clearly so but probably Persian in date is a gold signet ring found while workers were cleaning dirt from a stump of the city wall (Pritchard 1962: 116, fig. 78; Lipschits 1999: 176). Two animals, one a horse and the other a deer or gazelle, face one another. The style was identified as Persian by Pritchard in initial publications, without any elaboration (Pritchard 1962: 116). But Edith Porada (1963: 370) subsequently suggested that it reflects the orientalizing style of Greece in the seventh century b.c.e., and Pritchard (1964: 38) appears to have accepted this emended dating. C. Uehlinger agrees with Porada’s assessment of the iconography but points out that this style and subject matter continued from the seventh century until the early Achaemenid period, making a sixth-century date equally possible (Uehlinger: personal communication). E. Stern, on the other hand, classifies it among oval seals engraved with non-Greek motifs that date to the Persian period (Stern 1982: 199) without explaining what criteria have led to this assessment. The find spot provides no stratigraphic help in dating. Greek presence in the Cisjordan, via both trade and physical presence, began during the second half of the seventh century b.c.e. Evidence of trade is provided by imported Corinthian and east Greek pottery that has been uncovered at a number of coastal plain sites, such as Al Mina, Ras el-Bassit, Tell Sukas, Byblos, Khaldeh, Sidon, Kabri, Acco, Tell Keisan, Tel Dor, Meßad Hashavyahu, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Tel Miqne, Tel Batash, Tel oErani, Tell el-Hesi, Tell Jemmeh, and



Gibeon and the Gibeonites Revisited 159
two Negev sites, Tel Mal ̇ata and Tell er-Ruqeish (Waldbaum 1994: 59; Waldbaum and Magness 1997: 24; Waldbaum 1997: 1–17). The physical presence of Greeks as Egyptian mercenaries is likely at Meßad Hashavyahu at the end of the seventh century and in the Negev at the beginning of the sixth century, as indicated by the reference to the kittîm, who were to be supplied with provisions from Arad (Naaaman 1991: 45–48). Evidence for the continued presence of Greek trading ventures in the western Levant during the sixth century is supplied by phases II and III of Stratum G at Tell Sukas and at Naucratis, Daphnae, and Migdol in the Nile Delta. The Babylonian extermination of the Philistines ended Greek imports into Cisjordan proper via Philistine contacts but appears to have left trade intact within the empire at large, including Cisjordan, via the Egyptians and Phoenicians.2 Continuing trade contact between Greece and the Levant during the Persian era would allow a date in the fifth century as well for the silver signet ring. Finally, there is a ring that dates from the earliest to the Neo-Babylonian period, but which generally is thought to be from the Persian period—sixth or early fifth century b.c.e. The silver ring, inscribed in Aramaic, was found in 1959 in an unspecified context (Pritchard 1962: fig. 79, 116). As argued above, it is likely that Aramaic would have been the official language of correspondence and commerce in the area in the Neo-Babylonian period, so this is the earliest likely date for the ring, although it could also date to the Persian period, when Aramaic continued as the official language of the area.3 Proposed dates for the ring on paleographic and linguistic grounds include the late sixth century (Pritchard 1962: 116, fig. 79) and the fifth century (Avigad and Sass 1997: 284; Stern 2001: 545).
2. Here I would differ with D. Vanderhooft (1999: 86) in his conclusion that the Babylonians did little to foster trade between the Levant and the Greek world. They eliminated one trading partner, Philistia, but this provided less competition for the remaining Phoenician and north Syrian markets, which would have developed a monopoly of sorts for supplying Greek goods to the Babylonians once Egypt was left outside the empire. Philistia was probably eliminated because of its close ties with Egypt, preventing constant revolt supported by Egyptian troops in the area. The loss of Philistine ports would not necessarily have prevented luxury goods from reaching the Babylonian heartland, since they could have been secured via Phoenicia and north Syria, which was closer to Nineveh than Philistia. It is unfortunate that so little of Sidon and Tyre has been excavated; material evidence to support the increase in Greek imports in the sixth century would be most welcome. 3. E. Stern (1982: 201) dates it to the Persian period, grouping it with two unpublished gold signet rings from Wadi ed-Daliyeh but, again, provides no reason for dating it as Persian versus Neo-Babylonian. He admits that seals of his proposed grouping are quite rare.

The ring is unusual in that the inscription is cut positively rather than negatively, as though the ring face itself were a writing surface. Thus, it could not be used as a working seal by its owner. The carving is crude, making the reading of the letters difficult. Pritchard initially reported the inscription as lmrtsmn (Pritchard 1962: fig. 79, 116), but Avigad and Sass have indicated that the first mem and the taw are not certain (Avigad and Sass 1997: 284, #757), while P. Bordreuil has suggested the alternate reading mrasmn, without the initial lamed, and reading an aalep rather than a taw (Bordreuil 1992: 175).4 Personally, I do not see any clear evidence for an initial lamed in the only published photo available, and the last letter on the top line looks more like an intended aalep, whose diagonal stroke was inadvertently omitted, than an attempt at a taw, where no overlap of strokes has occurred. Given the unskilled, probably illiterate, hand that carved the letters, as well as the tendency to produce much too long a diagonal stroke in both mems, I would have expected overlap of the two strokes forming the inverted v of the last letter on the top row, had the carver been engraving a taw. This would have been easier than cutting the two strokes to meet as they do—and as they should to create an aalep. In addition, the angles of the existing strokes are correct for an aalep and less so for a taw, though this might be coincidence, given the carver’s lack of skill. Unfortunately, it appears as though the current location of the ring is uncertain, making a badly needed first-hand reexamination impossible (Avigad and Sass 1997: 284). If Pritchard’s original reading is adopted (lmrtsmn), the inscription would seem to read, ‘(belonging) to (the) lady of heaven’, with the preposition lé prefixed to the feminine-singular construct noun mrt, followed by the final masculine-plural absolute noun smyn, written defectively without its yod. The use of the construct to express a genitive relationship is not standard in Imperial Aramaic, where the relative particle dî would normally be used, but it is common in Biblical Aramaic (Rosenthal 1974: 25) and may reflect a continuing use of Hebrew genitive construction within the province, coloring the local dialect of Aramaic in Yehud. Assuming this reading, the ring either may have been a votive gift “to” the female deity whose title was “Lady of Heaven” (Avigad and Sass 1997: 284), or it might have been a gift used as an actual finger ring in the cult (Uehlinger: personal communication), to identify (“belonging to”) a priestess who was representing the female goddess

Gibeon and the Gibeonites Revisited 161
known as “Lady of Heaven,” or as a finger ring placed on the finger of a cult statue of such a goddess. The ring size is unknown. If the second reconstruction, mrasmn, is adopted, however, the inscription would read “Lord (is) aEshmun,” “strength (is) aEshmun,” or “aEshmun has reinforced” (Bordreuil 1992: 175). In this case, the ring may have borne the personal name of its owner, a nonnative to the region, who had commissioned the ring in order to have a working seal with his name; however, he was unable to use it as a seal, due to the error of an inexperienced engraver who forgot to carve the letters in reverse. He may simply have worn the ring as is, as jewelry. In the case of the second and third possible meanings, the ring might have been intended to function as an amulet, placing its owner under the protective power of aEshmun. Alternatively, if the first reading is adopted, the ring may have been a votive gift to the deity aEshmun, being worshiped locally—it may also have been intended as a finger ring, as suggested for the second reading above. Given the poor craftsmanship, however, I suspect that the ring was carved for its human owner, who may not have been literate himself if he accepted such poor work, and who may or may not have discovered that the engraving was done incorrectly for the ring to be used to produce a signature. More significant for determining the date when the pool was filled in is the failure of Yehud- or Yerushalayim-stamped handles to appear in the debris in the pool. Stern has suggested a relative dating for the Aramaic yhd stamps from the end of the fifth century down to Alexander’s conquest in approximately 333 b.c.e. (Stern 1982: 206) and a date for the Hebrew Yehud stamps (type C) and the yrslm stamps in the third and second centuries b.c.e. (Stern 1982: 209). The latter date is now confirmed by finds from excavations in the Jewish Quarter. In 1970, three yhd and three yrslm stamps were recovered alongside late Hellenistic sherds from a thick fill underneath the floor of an early Herodian building in Area C (Avigad 1974: 53). In 1971, a stamped handle of the yrslm class that was still attached to the neck and shoulders of its original jug was removed from Locus 936 in Area F, allowing the jug shape to be reconstructed with a high degree of certainty. In the same season, a group of whole and broken jugs of the same type, without the stamp, were found in Cistern 745 in Area E alongside folded, Hellenistic lamps of the open type, wheel-made delphiniform lamps locally produced, Hellenistic cooking pots and large jar fragments, all datable to the second century b.c.e. The entrance to the cistern was overlaid by the wall of a building dating to the first century b.c.e. (Avigad 1974: 56–57).



162 Diana Edelman
Before a final assessment can be made of the date that the pool was filled in and the town wall was destroyed, a consideration of Pritchard’s claim that the city wall was torn down and its stones used to fill in the pool at the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. (1962:163) is needed. The presence of stones from the city wall in the pool precludes a gradual filling by erosion and supports the idea that the pool was deliberately filled in. However, the proposed dating of this filling at the beginning of the sixth century, presumably around the time of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 b.c.e., is not based on any firm, stratigraphical evidence and is contradicted by the presence of the MWÍHstamped jar handles and the animal-stamped handles in the pool fill. Both of these stamps were introduced sometime after the end of the monarchy. Their presence toward the bottom of the fill, below the lmlk jar handles and inscribed jar handles, also indicates that the filling began sometime in the Persian period and was a deliberate action that pulled dirt either from one excavated area in the town or from various areas of the town where surface exposure preserved debris from the late eighth century onward. Pritchard’s subsequent argument that the discovery of the ring with the two animals in orientalizing Greek style that was found in a crack in the top level of the remaining wall in 17-0/P-20 in Area 10/9 indicates the end of the seventh century as the terminus ad quem for the destruction of the wall in this area is not conclusive either (Pritchard 1964: 38). The date of the ring is not certain, and the date and circumstances of its deposition are also unknown; it could have been hidden in the crack or between chinking stones when the wall stood intact, during a time of danger, and never retrieved. Or it could have been dropped by accident in a much later period after the wall had been reduced to a stump. The ring does not help date the destruction of the wall. The limited evidence available indicates that the pool was deliberately filled in some time in the early Persian period, as indicated by the presence of the MWÍH-stamped jar handles, the Aramaic-inscribed ring, and the two rearing lion stamps on the one hand, and the absence of the later series of stamped yhd and yrslm handles and any Persian or Hellenistic coins, on the other. Pritchard’s claim (1962: 163) that stones from the city wall were used to help fill in the pool cavity to ensure its permanent blockage would explain the wall stump in 17-0/P-20 in Area 10/9 without any evidence of a destruction layer. Who would have been responsible for these actions? It is extremely unlikely that the local residents would have blocked access to their own water and destroyed their protective defenses of their own accord.



Gibeon and the Gibeonites Revisited 163
Thus, it is logical to posit that the filling in of the pool and the weakening of the town’s long-standing defenses reflected some sort of deliberate governmental policy imposed on the settlement by local provincial authorities. The actions taken against Gibeon were most likely designed to prevent it from becoming a stronghold of resistance, a problem noted in various biblical texts (for example, 1 Sam 23:7–12; 2 Sam 17:13–14; 20:6).
The Textual Evidence
Textual evidence for Gibeon’s occupation during the Neo-Babylonian period is probably provided by Jer 41:12. After the murder of Gedaliah, the official Johanan, whom the Babylonians had put in place at Mizpah to oversee the non-golah community’s continued farming of the land, Johanan met the murderer, Ishmael, at the great waters in Gibeon. There he took away the Judeans that Ishmael had taken prisoner and was planning to take to Ammon. Strictly speaking, the mention of the waters does not require the site to have been settled at the time. It may or may not have been a reference to the pool within the town and may simply have been a well-known local landmark. Textual evidence for Gibeon’s occupation in the early Persian period is provided by Neh 7:25 and 1 Chr 8:29–40 and 9:35–44. The Nehemiah text lists men from Gibeon among those returning, while the two genealogies in Chronicles name Jeiel as the refounder of Persian-era Gibeon (Edelman 2001: 79–81). At first glance, these texts would seem to indicate that the site had been unoccupied in the Neo-Babylonian period. But in light of the pro-golah stance of the author of Nehemiah on the one hand, and Chronicler’s distance from these events and his uncritical reliance on the views of other writers on the other, we should be suspicious of such claims. They may merely reflect the resettlement of some members of the golah in Gibeon among the non-golah community already resident there and the desire to portray this as a new beginning for the site. The claim in Neh 3:7 that men of Gibeon helped rebuild the wall under Nehemiah’s initiative would require the site to have been occupied until about 440 b.c.e., if it is factually accurate. Such a date need not be inconsistent with the filling in of the pool and the weakening of the wall sometime in the sixth century. These actions need not have ended occupation at the site but may merely have prevented it from being a potential place that could withstand siege with its own internal water supply and strong defenses. The date of the final abandonment of the



164 Diana Edelman
site in the Persian period until its resettlement in the Roman era remains uncertain. With 90% of the site unexcavated, however, clearer evidence for the date of the final abandonment of the site prior to Roman occupation is available, should future excavations be undertaken.
Synthesis
What sort of dispute between the Persian-appointed golah representatives and the citizens of Gibeon would have led to the decommissioning of the city wall and the great pool? The genealogies in 1 Chronicles 8 and 9, as well as the account of Solomon’s dream incubation at Gibeon in 1 Kings 3 and 2 Chr 1:3–13 provide potential clues. The genealogies tie the royal house of Saul very closely to Gibeon, while 1 Kings 3 and 2 Chronicles 1 describe Gibeon as the religious precursor to Jerusalem, implying that it was the main sanctuary site under Saul (Edelman 2001: 81). With the arrival of the Persians as the new overlords, local hope that a puppet king would be put back on the throne in a rebuilt capital was probably renewed (Edelman 2001: 7478). Among the non-golah living in Gibeon and in nearby towns in Benjamin, hope in the restoration of the original ruling dynasty of the area, the Saulides, to their seat of power at Gibeon might logically have grown and been given voice. Such a hope would have met concrete opposition with the return of the pro-Davidic, pro-Jerusalemite golah faction, who gained control of the local provincial administration and the endorsement of the Persian authorities. Once the pro-Davidic golah had consolidated their position in power, they would have moved against their pro-Saulide opposition to ensure that they did not cause trouble in the future. The filling in of the pool at Gibeon and the weakening of its defensive wall would have been designed to prevent it from becoming a rallying point and unassailable bastion for pro-Saulides who opposed the newly established regime and contemplated overthrowing it. In the wake of its physical neutralization, new, loyalist golah settlers may have been moved in to serve as watchful eyes and ears as well (Edelman 2001: 79 n. 11). The reconstruction just proposed, admittedly based on circumstantial evidence, provides a plausible background against which the antiGibeonite bias in the Deuteronomistic History becomes intelligible. Saul’s connection with Gibeon is deliberately obfuscated in the History; instead of mentioning Gibeon by name, he is associated with “the hill” or “the hill of Saul.” The DtrH or a subsequent editor appears to have wanted to avoid acknowledging that Gibeon had served as the first



Gibeon and the Gibeonites Revisited 165
capital of the nation under Saul. Such textual “documentation” would have provided the non-golah faction with written, quotable proof for their argument for Gibeon’s historical precedence over Jerusalem and for the Saulide line’s chronological primacy over the Davidic line. Rather than simply ignore Gibeon’s former preeminence, however, the Historian has gone out of his way to villify the Gibeonites in Joshua 9. They are portrayed as non-Israelites who are deceitful in their dealings and so not to be trusted, even after they are joined to Israel via covenant. As a result of their deceit, they are made hewers of wood and drawers of water for the altar in Jerusalem, the place Yhwh will choose. How much of this story is based on reliable premonarchic tradition alone, on reliable tradition that has been edited in view of the early postexilic conflicts, and how much is a story composed in the Persian period in light of the conflicts and retrojected to the period of the occupation to function as a justification for the later neutralization of Gibeon remains unclear, but warrants further investigation. In an early Persian context, however, these accusations are especially revealing: the Gibeonites are not fully legitimate members of the returned golah community and cannot be trusted in spite of what they say; their bid to make Gibeon the cultic center of the Persian province and to be in control of a reestablished temple there has backfired and now they have been reduced to being temple slaves at the restored altar of Yhwh in Jerusalem.

The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah
and the Fashioning of
National Remembrance
Yair Hoffman
Tel Aviv University
Introduction
Zechariah 7–8 has a basic question-and-answer structure: to the question of whether mourning practices are to be maintained (“Shall I weep . . . in the fifth month?” 7:1–3), the prophet responds with a lengthy answer that includes preaching (7:4–14) and assurance of the complete salvation of Jerusalem (chap. 8). This will be expressed by, among other things, the transformation of the days of fasting and mourning observed by the people into days of joy and festivals (8:1819) and the establishment of Jerusalem as a spiritual center for all peoples (8:20–23). A similar structure is known from other prophecies as well. The dominant model in the visions of the prophets is a question posed by God (such as Isa 6:8; Jer 1:11–12, 13–19; Amos 7:8; 8:2; Zech 5:1) or by the prophet (such as Zech 1:9; 2:2; 4:4, 12; 6:4). In other prophecies a question (or statement that the prophet quotes) is voiced by a certain individual or by the people, and the prophecy is the response—such as: Isaiah 37; Jer 18:18–23; 21:1–10; 42:1–22; Ezek 12:21–28; 18:1–32; 20:1ff.; 26:1–21; 28:1–11; 33:23–29; Mal 2:17–3:12; 3:13–18. The book of Haggai, a contemporary of Zechariah, also contains prophecies that are presented as the response to a question: Hag 1:2–6 (or 11); 2:10–19. Accordingly, there is no structural reason not to view the unit of Zechariah 7–8 as a single prophecy.1 Furthermore, the question pertains directly to mourning practices, and the direct answer to it appears toward the end of chap. 8, thus indicating an inclusio that
1. Thus, for example, Zer-Kavod 1957: 27, 91; Uffenheimer 1961: 122; Hanhart (1998: 456) considers these chapters to be a single tripartite unit (dreigliederig Inhalt).

further bonds chaps. 7–8 into a single prophecy: its opening (7:1–6) is a question concerning mourning practices and a direct, though partial answer; and its conclusion (8:19) completes the direct answer; in the middle are digressions that ensue from the question and that eventually return to a complete answer to this question. A more reasonable hypothesis, however, which is the first basic assumption of this essay, is that the present structure of Zechariah 7–8 is the end product of the redaction of a number of prophecies. In order to unite the individual prophecies into an editorially coherent unit, the editor created an inclusio structure: an opening question that is answered in the conclusion.2 Indeed, the subject of the mourning practices mentioned both in the question and answer is of independent standing in this unit. These practices are discussed expressly only in the two sections, 7:1–6 and 8:19, while there is no allusion to them in the other parts of the unit. Moreover, these two sections may be isolated from their context without inflicting any harm to their meaning. We will therefore relate to them as an independent unit capable of standing on its own, which we will refer to as the “prophecy of the fasts” (PoF), which is the sole subject of the current essay. This obviously does not negate the option of examining chaps. 7–8 as a single, complete, redactional formulation and of exploring its significance as such, but this would exceed the purview of the current study. The second assumption on which this discussion is based is the accepted explanation that the fasts mentioned in the PoF pertain to the events at the time of the destruction of the First Temple:3 the fast of the
2. Thus, int. al., H. G. Mitchell 1912: 84, 194; Elliger 1967: 132–34; Ackroyd 1968: 207; Meyers and Meyers 1987: 376–442; Butterworth 1992: 70–72; Tollington 1993: 25. I will forego a discussion of the delimitation of the prophetic units that were redacted together in this section, since it not the purpose of my paper. 3. This is not the proper venue for a discussion of all the questions relating to the various phases of the erection of the Temple until its dedication. The order of events that I propose is as follows: Zerubbabel and Joshua came to the land of Israel in the first year of Darius (522 b.c.e.; all the dates in this article are b.c.e. unless specified otherwise), and not with Sheshbazzar in 539. Immediately upon their arrival they built “the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it” (Ezra 3:2). “In the second year after their arrival” (v. 8), the builders began laying the foundations for the Temple (v. 10) which is the same as “the day when the foundation was laid for the Lord’s Temple” (Hag 2:18; for the date, the ninth month of the second year of Darius, see Hag 2:10). The date of the dedication of the Temple was “the sixth year of the reign of King Darius” (Ezra 6:15, 516 b.c.e.). Much has been written about the problems pertaining to the construction of the Temple, the arrival of Zerubbabel, and so on; see, inter alia, Ackroyd 1968; Cross 1975: 4–18; Myers 1965: 26–29, 43–46, 50–54; 1982: 66–98. Recently, see Lipschits 1999: 271–310; Hoffman 2000: 103–26.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 171
fourth month (8:19) is connected with the day in the month of Tammuz when the city wall was breached (Jer 52:6–7); the fast of the fifth month, Ab (Zech 7:3, 5; 8:19), is linked to the burning of the Temple (2 Kgs 25:8–9 = Jer 52:12–13); the fast of the seventh month (Zech 7:5; 8:19) relates to the assassination of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam (Jer 41:1); and the fast of the tenth month (Zech 8:19) was apparently established in connection with the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem (Jer 52:4).4 A third assumption, which is maintained by most scholars5 but which I accept only partially, is that the vague answer to the simple question that requires a “yes” or “no” answer presumes that the observance of the fasts is to be continued. Displeasure at the very request to consider favorably the cessation of the mourning practices sounds throughout the rhetorical question, “did you fast for my benefit? . . . [W]ho but you does the eating, and who but you does the drinking?” (Zech 7:5–6).6 This dissatisfaction is also indicated by the pledge that every one of the memorial days “shall become occasions for joy and gladness, happy festivals for the House of Judah” (8:19). I can find no basis for the argument raised by some scholars that Zechariah ordered the cessation of the fasts.7 In a decision of this typethe cancellation of an existing practice—a more unequivocal statement would be expected, while here there is not even a hint of such a ruling. So, then, why do the prophet’s words also not contain a definite
4. According to R. Simeon b. Yohai, however, ”’The fast of the tenth month’—this is the fifth of Tevet, on which the report came to the exile that the city had fallen (Ezek 33:21) . . . , and they put the day of the report on the same footing as the day of the burning” (b. Ros Has. 18b, where the rabbis discuss the question of the fasts and their order), meaning that the fast was established in Babylonia (see below). Ackroyd (1968: 207) offers the hypothesis that the fasts of the fourth and tenth months possibly ensued from other reasons and were unrelated to the destruction of the Temple, but there is no support for such a conjecture. 5. See, inter alia, Licht 1971: 694; Uffenheimer 1961: 127; Meyers and Meyers 1987: 393–94. Some commentators accept the ambiguity of the prophet’s answer and make no attempt to resolve it. Thus, Abarbanel states: “Since you, on your own volition, fasted, now too you will be eating and drinking, without asking this of me, and the mouth that forbade will be the mouth that permits” (Don Abarbanel: 221). But what is the identity of that “mouth”? Abrabanel does not illuminate this point. In the final analysis, Zer-Kavod (1957: 91–93) also does not explain what Zechariah’s answer to the question was; neither does Mitchell 1912: 197–200. 6. See Mitchell 1912: 197: “The question, therefore, though in form a request for instruction, is really a proposal for the abolition of the now meaningless fast.” 7. Thus, for example, Hanson (1975: 104) argues that “Zechariah reports the abolishment of these fasts” and even uses this assumption as the basis for the determination of a terminus ante quem for the time of the prophecy of the fast in Isaiah 58, which, in his opinion (erroneously, see below) refers to the memorial fasts.



172 Yair Hoffman
instruction to continue the fasts but only an indirect message?8 The accepted explanation, which I maintain is deficient, is that a clear decision for the continuation of the mourning practices was liable to be interpreted as derogatory of what had already been attained; as if the return to Zion, the restoration of the ruins of Jerusalem, and the rebuilding of the Temple bore no relation to the vision of redemption. Consequently, the prophet “does not state explicitly that the fasts are to be canceled or to be observed, and his words may be viewed as a sort of allusion that for the time being the fasts are not to be annulled” (Licht 1971: 694); ”He is careful not to cancel them, lest this be understood as a sign that the time of divine compassion and redemption has already arrived” (Uffenheimer 1961: 127). If this were so, however, then the prophet would likely have responded with a clear affirmative to the question “Shall I weep . . . as I have been doing?” with the addition of a fitting clarification, lest his intent be misunderstood. I also am of the opinion that the vagueness of the answer, the use of rhetoric that must be read “between the lines,” is not coincidental. But the proposed reason is insufficient, and I will attempt to add a more vital explanation below. Another traditional argument that I wish to challenge is that this section in Zechariah attests to a reality in which the memorial fasts were a prevalent popular practice on the eve of the dedication of the Second Temple,9 an observance that endured in Israel for a prolonged and continuous period after the destruction of the First Temple, in the format known to us from after the destruction of the Second Temple. I will seek to refute this view and demonstrate that the passage shows a gradual formulation of the practice of memorial fasts. This process was in an initial stage during the time of Zechariah and was finally defined only in a much later period.
8. According to another view, the prophet simply did not answer the question. Thus, for example, Kahana (1930: 155) notes in his commentary that “specifically regarding this matter he found it difficult to issue a definite ruling.” Similarly also Kaufmann 1977: 4.297, 299: “There is no legal ruling in his response. . . . Zechariah does not really answer the question of the Babylonian delegation at all”; see also Ackroyd 1968: 208; Beuken 1977: 145. This conjecture, however, can hardly be accepted: to what end would the text pose an unequivocal question if it did not intend to respond to it? According to Elliger (1967: 134), the prophet’s response is indirect: everyone will do as he pleases, provided that he or she loves “honesty and integrity.” 9. Mitchell 1912: 200: “these fasts had been observed since the beginning of the Exile, or since Jerusalem was taken in 586”; and also: “These four fasts were observed in the period between the destruction of the First Temple and the construction of the Second” (Tabory 1995: 398; Tabory’s discussion of the “memorial fasts” appears on pp. 396–406).



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 173
There were three factors influencing this process—the manner in which the events of the destruction were commemorated, the number of days on which they were observed, and the degree of popular acceptance of the memorial days—as the commemorative fasts were developed into their later format, with which we are familiar from the halakhic literature. I maintain that Zechariah 7–8 is to be understood in the context of a struggle over the fashioning of the national collective memory10 in the second half of the sixth century b.c.e. The Bible occasionally uses a short narrative focused within a defined time and place to present a topic of a general and fundamental nature that exceeds the bounds of the immediate time of the narrative. Thus, for example, the real subject of the Korah narrative (Numbers 16) is the general state of relations between priests and Levites, not the one-time rebellion in the wilderness; the narrative of the prophesying by the 70 elders (Numbers 11) is directed to the fundamental questions connected with the essential nature of prophecy; the narrative of the scroll burned by Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 36) refers to the issue of the validity of written prophetic statements; and there are many more like examples. Our section of Zechariah should be regarded in a similar light, and I will adopt a methodology that is consistent with this subtle literary style. The methodology seemingly required for a discussion of this topic would be an analysis of the passage itself, including an examination of its problems and our proposed solutions. When joined together, the analysis, examination of problems, and solutions would provide a firm basis for dealing with the conjectures that were raised. In this case, however, we will follow a different path. I begin with a presentation of data external to the PoF that shed light on the general subject of fasting, and only then move on to examining the PoF itself. The reason for this procedure is that an unequivocal and satisfactory solution cannot be offered for most of the interpretive problems in the passage. Each suggested resolution is, at best, only possible—but not essential, and not free of difficulties. Accordingly, if we were to base our position on the sum of the solutions that we selected and argue that the text by itself contains proofs for such a stance, we would run the risk of circular reasoning. However, the early presentation of a broader framework for the discussion will direct us to a more thorough understanding of the texts, a more intelligent selection of solutions to the problems raised by
10. For the term “collective memory,” see the more extensive discussion below, n. 79.

these texts, and, as we shall see, a justification for the skeptical approach that accompanies our examination of the passage.
Fasts in the Bible outside the Book of Zechariah
Fasts commemorating the destruction of the Temple were the result of the application of a fundamental ritual idea according to which fast days came to be associated with specific annual dates. The ancients were aware that fast days could be established for various purposes—in the current case, the fashioning of the national memory. In other words, if the medium (the practice of fast days on fixed annual dates) was already available in Israel, then all that was needed to fix the destruction of Jerusalem in the national memory was to use this medium for a new purpose and provide it with new dates. This could not have happened if the mechanism had not already been in place. It would have been necessary first to create such a medium before filling it with specific content. Obviously, this does not mean that a vehicle was created in the abstract to be loaded with particular content later, because this is not how customs are created. However, when the vehicle does not yet exist, it is plausible that it will evolve gradually, not in a single casting, ex nihilo, for the purpose of holding content that has just now been imagined—the commemoration of the catastrophe of the destruction. This is especially true because we are not dealing with a modern state, in which memorial dates are established (using an existing, recognized, accepted model) by an official government and immediately assume validity; nor is the venue an orderly kingdom from the ancient world, in which it was possible to fashion the national memory by royal command; neither are we speaking of postbiblical Judaism, which was subordinate to the all-powerful, definitive halakhah. Our venue is Judah, whose national and religious center had recently disintegrated when the people were exiled from their land, and whose sons were dispersed in more than one land: in Judah and its neighboring regions (see Jer 40:11, which speaks of “all the Judeans who were in Moab, Ammon, and Edom, or who were in other lands”), in Egypt, and in Babylonia. Under these circumstances, the memorial fasts could have been realized as a uniform national practice only if the very concept of an annual fast day was already known and applied in other contexts. Consequently, when we examine the PoF, it will be of importance to determine if the memorial notion of a specific annual day for fasting for any purpose was already available in post-destruction Israel.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 175
Noncalendrical Fasts
The practice of fasting is described in many passages in the Bible outside the book of Zechariah but none except Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement; see below) is an annual, calendrical fast day. The fasts in the personal realm and in the national sphere may be divided into two main types.11 The first type may be called a “preventive fast” or in rabbinic terminology a ‘public fast’ (taoanit zibur; see, for example, y. oErub. 6.8; Yoma 8.112). Its purpose is to prevent anticipated calamity or to deter the aggravation of an already difficult situation, with an entreaty for its amelioration. The most common circumstances for this category of fasting are documented in the Bible in the context of war. After their defeat and on the eve of their second battle against the Benjaminites, the Israelites went up to Bethel, and “they fasted that day until evening” (Judg 20:26); Samuel established a day of prayer and fasting consequent upon the debacle at the hands of the Philistines and prior to the next war against them (1 Sam 7:6); as the Babylonian army approached Jerusalem, Zedekiah called for a fast day (Jer 36:15).13 Fasting is also evident in the context of natural calamities, such as drought (Jer 14:12), a plague of locusts (Joel 1:14; 2:12, 15), or any event, the consequences of which are liable to be disastrous (Jonah 3:5; Esth 4:3). The other context for a “preventive fast” is the personal sphere. Such was the fast observed by David, who feared for the life of his son (2 Sam 12:16, 21–23), or the fast of the poet who sought the salvation of his God and attested of himself, “I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Ps 35:13). Similar to this was the fast evoked by Ezra on the eve of his departure on the perilous journey from Babylonia to Jerusalem (Ezra 8:21, 23). Although this was not fasting done by only one individual but by the entire group of immigrants, it nevertheless was not a fast for the people or community as a whole.
11. A more detailed classification of the various fasting contexts is provided by Gamberoni 1970: 257–60. 12. Taoanit appears only once in the Bible, in the form: “I arose mi-taoaniti,” Ezra 9:5), and it is not clear whether this refers to fasting or to other mourning practices. 13. Rudolph and Holladay maintain that this fast day was called because of the drought depicted in Jer 14:1–13; I can find no foundation for this conjecture. Nor is there any basis for the supposition by Kraus (1963: 13–15) that this refers to Yom Hakippurim, since the context and wording of the text, “proclaimed a fast before the Lord” (Jer 36:9), clearly demonstrate that this was not a fixed annual fast. See Rudolph 1969: 232; Holladay 1989: 255–57. See also recently Hoffman 2001: 663–66.

The second type is a “mourning fast.” The inhabitants of JabeshGilead fasted for seven days after the death of Saul (1 Sam 31:13), with both David and the people adopting mourning practices and fasting “until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the soldiers of the Lord and the House of Israel who had fallen by the sword” (2 Sam 1:12).14 Evidence of a mourning fast is also found in the Elephantine papyri, which postdate Zechariah by about a century. In letter no. 30, following Cowley’s (1923) count,15 the Jews of Elephantine relate that, after the destruction of their temple, they “put on sackcloth and fasted and prayed to Yaau the Lord of Heaven” (line 15);16 “till this day we wear sackcloth and fast. Our wives are made widow-like; we do not anoint ourselves with oil, and we drink no wine” (line 20).17 This letter clearly conveys the information that this fast was not a memorial day, a calendrical annual fast day, but was part of the mourning practices that were observed for about three years,18 from the time of the ruin of the Elephantine sanctuary in the summer of 410 until the dispatch of the letter in the month of Marheshvan in the year 408 (for a further discussion of this letter, see below). Also of relevance here is the late biblical testimony of the book of Esther. The book relates that, when the Jews learned of the decree by the king and Haman, they engaged in “fasting, weeping, and wailing, and everybody lay in sackcloth and ashes” (Esth 4:3). They thereby complied with Esther’s request to “fast in my behalf; do not eat or drink for three days” (v. 16). The royal decree was overturned, and the day designated for the destruction of all the Jews became one for the taking of vengeance against their enemies. Then “the Jews undertook and irrevocably obligated themselves and their descendants . . . to
14. It is related of Jezebel that she wrote letters as follows: “Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth at the front of the assembly” (1 Kgs 21:9), without specifying the reason for this fast. The narrator apparently intended to emphasize Jezebel’s cynicism, since she sought to publicly display the presumed sin of Naboth, who “has reviled God and king” (v. 13), as one that was extremely grave, that could bring calamity upon the entire people. Thus, employing a tactic with which a certain type of leader has always been familiar, she mobilized the people as a whole against Naboth. 15. A similar formulation appears in an additional copy of this letter that is marked as no. 31 (see lines 14, 19–20).

18. “The three year duration of mourning for the Temple suggests that mourning for the deceased was an intense affair” (Porten 1968: 186). Porten does not raise the possibility of an annual fast on a specific date.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 177
observe these two days in the manner prescribed and at the proper time each year . . . these days of Purim shall never cease among the Jews, and the memory of them shall never perish among their descendants” (Esth 9:27–28). This, however, refers to the commemoration of days of rejoicing, while nothing is said about an annual fast.19 This is especially arresting, because the conclusion of the book of Esther, which emphasizes that this time “had been transformed for them from one of grief and mourning to one of festive joy” (9:22), is an apparent allusion to the prophecy of Zechariah that the fasts shall become occasions “for joy and gladness, happy festivals” (Zech 8:19). This, then, is additional proof that the establishment of annual fast days was not a customary practice, not even in a late period such as the time when the book of Esther was composed.20 All the fasts enumerated above share two common characteristics that distinguish them from the fasts in the book of Zechariah: (1) none of them is a “memorial fast”; and (2) all are fasts of a temporary nature; they were not established in the calendar for all time.21
Yom Kippur
To what extent does Yom Kippur, which is established in the yearly calendar as “a law for all time: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month” (Lev 16:29), exceed the above-mentioned dual common denominator? Does it attest to the existence of a vessel, or medium, for establishing a yearly fast day for posterity?
19. The verse “just as they have assumed for themselves and their descendants the obligation of the fasts with their lamentations” (Esth 9:31) does not establish this as a permanent observance, although this was so expounded in the later halakhah (see Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Fasting 5:5). Ibn Ezra, who interpreted the verse in this manner, notes that this is “the opinion of many”; this probably reflects reliance on a tradition that this was the simple meaning of the text, although not necessarily his own view. For the late practice of “The Fast of Esther” on Adar 13, see below. 20. Esther is commonly regarded to be one of the late books of the Bible, if not the latest. The scholars positing a late composition date it to the late Hasmonean period (John Hyrcanus); thus Pfeiffer 1942: 732–33, 742. Those placing the book of Esther in the late third century include Bardtke 1963: 252–55. Those in favor of an early date place the time of its composition in the late Persian period; see Kaufmann 1977: 4.518–22; Hirschler 1930: 228; Heltzer 1994: 215–16; Eissfeldt 1964: 691; Gerleman 1973: 37–39. 21. In Isa 1:13 the prophet speaks of hrx[w ˆwa in the context of “new moon and Sabbath,” “your new moons and your festivals.” The Septuagint renders this as nhsteian kai argian (‘fast’). It is doubtful if this version is to be accepted, and even if so, we should not conclude from this rendering that the verse reflects the observance of a calendrical fast in the Israel of Isaiah’s time.



178 Yair Hoffman
The Torah commands the ‘affliction of the soul’ (μkytwçpn ta μtyn[w, for example, Lev 23:27, and see below) on Yom Kippur and, if it existed as an annual fast day prior to the time of Zechariah, this idea could have been used as a model for establishing new annual memorial fasts. The question, therefore, is a double one: from what date was Yom Kippur observed, and when was fasting on Yom Kippur instituted? This holy day is mentioned in only three biblical passages, all part of the Priestly stratum of the Torah: Leviticus 16; 23:26–32; Num 29:7–11. Aside from these texts, there is no additional reference to Yom Kippur in the entire Bible, not even in the most expected contexts, such as several of the passages surveyed above that speak of fasting. In his vision of the Temple, Ezekiel commands the cleansing of the Temple “on the first day of the first month” (Ezek 45:18) and “you shall do the same on the seventh day of the month” (v. 20; in the Septuagint it is: ejn tΩ eJbdovmw mhnμ miaÅ touÅ mhno;Í ‘in the seventh month, on the first [day] of the month)’ but does not mention Yom Kippur. The prophet Malachi, who voices many reproaches on matters relating to the Temple rite (1:7, 8, 12–14; 2:13; 3:8), does not speak of it. Nor is there any allusion to this day in the events connected with the rebuilding of the altar by the returnees to Zion, which happened “from the first day of the seventh month” (Ezra 3:6) until “the Festival of Tabernacles” (v. 4). Similarly, there is no reference to Yom Kippur in regard to the reading of the Torah and the sealing of the covenant (hnmah), which began “on the first day of the seventh month” (Neh 8:2), continued on the Festival of Tabernacles (vv. 13–18), and ended “on the twenty-fourth day of this month” (9:1). Loewenstamm (1958: 599) takes note of the narratives of the dedication of the First Temple in 1 Kgs 8:65, 66, and in 2 Chr 7:8–10, according to which the tenth of the seventh month fell during the days of the dedication of the Temple. It is inconceivable, however, that they would engage in such activity on the date of Yom Kippur, and certainly not without mentioning it at all. Loewenstamm raises the possibility that “the reliability of these texts is doubtful.” But if these texts are the product of a late addition, then they teach that the later redactors, whose perception of the past was most likely influenced by the practices of their time, also were not bothered by the dating of the Temple dedication to the week in which Yom Kippur fell. According to the well-known dictum of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, on Yom Kippur (and on the fifteenth of Ab), “the daughters of Jerusalem used to go forth in borrowed white garments. . . . [T]hey went forth to dance in the vineyards” (m. Taoan. 4:8). Regardless of whether or not there is a firm historical basis for this depiction, it reflects a tradition that, in



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 179
the First Temple period, Yom Kippur was observed in a manner completely different from the manner mandated by the law of the Torah. All these data lead to the conclusion that the law of Yom Kippur in the Torah postdates the time of Zechariah (and possibly also that of Ezra) and that Yom Kippur was not yet celebrated as a nationwide holy day; it certainly was not a fast day. The obligation to fast on Yom Kippur is known from five verses in the Torah (Lev 16:29, 31; 23:27, 29; Num 29:7), none of which uses the root μwx but, rather, the expression μkytwçpn ta wn[t\μtyn[w (‘you shall afflict your souls’, Num 29:7)22 and, in the passive, hn[t al çpnh lk rça (literally, ‘every soul that is not afflicted’, Lev 23:29). Thus, the question arises: if the text meant an actual fast, why did it not even once employ the unequivocal root μwx, which is quite common in biblical language (23 occurrences)? I share with others the view that, by using the root hn[, the Torah meant that people should refrain from certain foods, such as meat or other delicacies, rather then absolute fasting.23 ‘Affliction of the soul’ hn[ appears in direct parallelism to μwx only in the prophecy regarding proper fasting: “Why when we fasted [wnmx] . . . when we starved our bodies [wnçpn wnyn[]” (Isa 58:3); “a fast [μwx] . . . a day for men to starve their bodies [wçpn μda twn[]” (v. 5); “and satisfy the famished creature [hn[n çpnw]” (v. 10). This prophecy, however, is dated to the Second Temple period, after Zechariah’s time. The second occasion is Ps 35:13: “I afflicted my soul with fasting [yçpn μwxb ytyn[],” a psalm whose dating is very doubtful.24 None of these verses provides proof that vpn ywny[ is necessarily identical to μwx, but rather that fasting is the most extreme expression of afflicting one’s soul. We may therefore surmise that the expression vpn ywny[ in the law of Yom Kippur was
22. çpn, with the meaning of ‘throat, mouth’; see BDB, 660 (5); KB, 672. 23. Thus, Loewenstamm 1958: 595–600. Licht (1971: 695) is of the opinion that the çpn ywny[ of Yom Kippur means fasting, but he also comments that “the wording çpn ywny[ could also be used other than in the context of a fast, for we have found it in the context of vows (Num 30:14). The majority view of the commentators is that the intent is abstinence from a certain food or from a certain pleasure . . . but it is doubtful whether it was considered to be a fast in the biblical period.” 24. The psalm contains no clear reference by which to date it, and therefore scholars date it each in accordance with his or her fundamental approach to Psalms, one assigning it an early date, while another attributes it to a late period. Thus, for example, those who assign it a very late date place it in the Hasmonean period (such as Kittel 1914: 141), others advance it to the Persian period (e.g., Briggs and Briggs 1906: 302; Buttenweiser 1938: 444–53), and those who assign it an early date, in accordance with their general approach, place it in the First Temple period (e.g., Kaufmann 1960: 2.506–10; Weiser 1962: 91–95; Dahood 1966: xxix–xxx).

interpreted only later as an absolute fast, in one of the later developments of this holy day. Consequently, Yom Kippur as well does not exceed the two characteristics mentioned above, and there is no proof for the existence of the model already discussed—an annual calendrical fast—prior to the time of Zechariah.25 Still to be clarified, however, is the testimony of the texts other than the PoF regarding the memorial fasts.
Are There Proofs Other Than the Prophecy of the Fasts of the Observance of Fasts Commemorating the Destruction?
The text in Zechariah indicates that the practice of fasts was observed “all these seventy years.” If so, then we could reasonably expect to find testimonies in additional biblical texts of the existence of this practice before the time of Zechariah. An examination reveals that such testimonies do not exist, not even in texts whose context seems to invite such a reference. The book of Ezekiel, some of whose prophecies were most likely written after the destruction, contains no mention of memorial fasts. The same is true of Psalm 137, which describes the practice of the exiles who resided “by the rivers of Babylon” and wept over the destruction as they remembered Zion.26
25. A similar conclusion regarding Yom Kippur is accepted by many scholars. See, e.g., de Vaux 1965: 510; Guthrie 1962: 242; Rylaarsdam 1962: 314. 26. The precise time of Psalm 137 is the subject of scholarly debate: was it written in Babylonia, as soon as the deportees arrived at their place of exile, or perhaps many years after this in Babylonia, or possibly even in the land of Israel? The past tense ‘we sat’ [wnbçy] and ‘we wept’ [wnykb] does not aid greatly regarding this question. The wording “there [μç] we sat . . .” shows that they are no longer sitting by the rivers of Babylon, but it is unclear whether it may be concluded that they no longer are in Babylonia because they have already returned to the land of Israel; or perhaps this wording indicates that they were moved from “the rivers of Babylon,” where they had first arrived, to other locations in Babylonia. The wording hdwdçh lbb tb (v. 8) also is not unequivocal: if it is to be interpreted as Babylon’s having already been hdwdç [‘destroyed’], then this would have been after its conquest by Cyrus in 540. In this case the continuation of the verse “a blessing on him who repays you in kind” is to be understood as the expression of disappointment that the conquest of Babylonia did not lead to its destruction, as it deserved. The word hdwdç, however, may also be understood in an active sense (as tddwç), in which case this statement may have been made before 540. The same is true of the reference to the Edomites (v. 7): the hatred of Edom continued for many years after the fall of Jerusalem, and it is difficult to date the psalm in accordance with the curse directed against the latter.

The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 181
There is no allusion to memorial fasts in the book of Lamentations, although it mentions mourning practices for Jerusalem and its people (1:2, 4, 16, 17, 21; 2:10). In a retrospective view of the destruction, the poet grieves, “because of this our hearts are sick; because of these our eyes are dimmed” (5:17), but does not allude to memorial fasts. Scholars disagree regarding the unity of the book of Lamentations and its specific historical background.27 This is not the proper occasion to examine this question. Even if we follow the view that ascribes an early date to the composition of Lamentations, it still could not have been written during the fall of Jerusalem itself,28 for it contains many passages (mainly in chap. 5) that reflect a perspective of looking back, such as: “Judah has gone into exile because of misery and harsh oppression; when she settled among the nations . . .” (1:3); “our heritage has passed to aliens, our homes to strangers” (5:2); “slaves are ruling over us, with none to rescue us from them” (5:8); “because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it” (5:18); “why have You forgotten us utterly, forsaken us for all time?” (5:20). The conclusion must be, then, that no memorial fasts were established immediately after the destruction. If
27. According to Perles (1930: 97–98), the book was written by a number of authors after the fall of Jerusalem and before the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus. A similar view is held by Klein 1994: 111 and, with minor changes, Gottwald 1954: 19–22; Weiser 1957: 300–302; Eissfeldt 1964: 682; Hillers 1972: xviii–xxiii; Renkema 1998: 54–57; 35–40. Rudolph maintains a similar position, but he suggests that chap. 1 may have already been written in 597, during the siege that preceded the exile of Jehoiachin; see Rudolph 1962: 193–99. For a survey of the scholarly research on the book of Lamentations and the date of its composition, see Gous 1992: 184–205. 28. This is the view of Kaufmann (1960: 3.584), who maintains that the entire book is “the work of a single craftsman.” Regarding its time, Kaufmann comments: “these poems contain quite clear testimony that they were composed during the very time of the destruction” (1960: 3.591). According to him, the book contains a lament over the violation of the Temple, but “mention is not made of its burning by Nebuzaradan. Similarly, the burning of the houses of Jerusalem is not mentioned. . . . The gates of Jerusalem are deserted (1:4), the wall was laid waste . . . but the wall exists. . . . Jerusalem appears in these poems as a city whose inhabitants are still present in it. Granted, it is in ruins and destroyed. ‘Her king and her leaders’ have already been sent into exile (2:9) . . . but its people still dwells in it” (Kaufmann 1960: 3.593). All these claims, however, are baseless. The book patently offers literary portrayals of different situations in order to illustrate graphically the dimensions of the disaster and, for dramatic effect, the authors also depict “authentic” scenes dating to the destruction itself, along with descriptions written with the perspective of time (see the examples below). It is inconceivable that the book was “concluded” before the burning of the Temple, but no attempt was made to “update” this detail! Consequently, the absence of any explicit reference to the conflagration is in no wise proof of its composition during the course of the battles in which Jerusalem fell.



182 Yair Hoffman
one follows the later dating, then this conclusion may be applied to a period even closer to Zechariah. In either case, the book of Lamentations contains no proof that its author (or authors) was cognizant of a practice of fasting to commemorate the destruction. Two other texts in which we would expect to find allusions to memorial fasts are the prophecies in the so-called “Trito-Isaiah” (Isaiah 56–66), which is universally dated after the return to Zion, with some scholars even placing it after the dedication of the Second Temple and the construction of the wall.29 In Isaiah 58 the prophet responds to the complaints by the people: “Why, when we fasted, did You not see? When we starved our bodies, did You pay no heed?” (Isa 58:3). There is no hint here of memorial days, the fast is not linked to any specific date,30 and the context teaches that this refers to the practice of preventive fasts (rwbyx tyn[t; see above), which apparently was a prevalent custom in this period.31 Another illuminating reference is “Rejoice with Jerusalem . . . join in her jubilation, all you who mourned over her” (Isa 66:10). First, it mentions mourning but does not speak of fasting. Second, no allusion is made to calendrical days commemorating the past destruction of Jerusalem but, rather, most likely to mourning practices pertaining to the difficult situation of Jerusalem in the present. Support for this interpretation is provided by the continuation of the prophet’s vision:
29. See the surveys of the scholarly research in the commentaries and in the various introductory works, such as Eissfeldt 1964: 459–66; Weiser 1961: 205–8; Westermann 1969: 295–308. See also Hanson 1975: 32–46. 30. Westermann does not distinguish between the memorial fasts and the various public fasts, and his statements on this matter are totally baseless. See, for example, his commentary on Isa 58:2–3: “As Zechariah tells us (7:3, 8:18) to the post-exilic community the fasts were a source of great perplexity. As attested in particular by Lamentations [? Y.H.] the fast days, basically seasons of lamentations, came into being following upon the disasters of the year 586. . . . [I]n the course of time people began to question such continuing occasions of lamentation. In all probability the utterance of Trito Isaiah . . . contributed towards their being given up” (Westermann 1969: 335). A similar opinion regarding the essential nature of the fast in Isaiah 58 is voiced by Hanson 1975 (see above, n. 7). 31. This tendency intensified and reached its peak in the wake of the destruction of the Second Temple. Possibly as a result of this trend, the rabbis saw fit to list in Megillat Taoanit the days on which fasting is prohibited (for Megillat Taoanit, see Tabory 1995: 30722). Urbach (1975: 434) is of the opinion that “the fasts that multiplied after the destruction also assumed the character of a surrogate and replacement for the atonement effected by the sacrifices.” See also Urbach 1975: 446–47. Isaiah 58 is read as the Haftorah in the Shaharit service of Yom Kippur, but it plainly does not speak of this day, and the commentators over the centuries understood the prophecy as referring to a public fast; they did not relate it to Yom Kippur.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 183
“. . . that you may suck from her breast consolation to the full. . . . I will extend prosperity to her like a stream. . . . The power of the Lord shall be revealed on behalf of his servants; but he shall rage against his foes. . . . Those eating the flesh of the swine, the reptile, and the mouse shall one and all come to an end, declares the Lord” (vv. 11–17). These verses attest the poverty of Jerusalem and the sinful behavior of its dwellers, and this, not the destruction of the First Temple, is what the mourners grieve. But even when the destruction is mentioned in the public entreaty in Isa 63:7–64:11 (“Our holy Temple, our pride . . . has been consumed by fire; and all that was dear to us is ruined,” 64:10), the worshiper makes no allusion to any memorial fast. Another text tells of a fast called by the people in the Ezra–Nehemiah period, the middle of the fifth century b.c.e., “on the twentyfourth day of this [the seventh] month” (Neh 9:1). This, too, does not relate to memorial fasts but to a public preventive fast that was instituted in light of the harsh situation in Judah (“Today we are slaves. . . . They rule over our bodies,” Neh 9:36–37).32 The book of Daniel also provides an apt opportunity for mention of the fasts commemorating the destruction. Daniel relates that, in the first year of Darius, “I consulted the books concerning the number of years that, according to the word of the Lord that had come to Jeremiah the prophet, were to be the term of Jerusalem’s desolation—seventy years. I turned my face to the Lord God, devoting myself to prayer and supplication, in fasting, in sackcloth and ashes” (Dan 9:23). Even though the passage expressly mentions the fall of Jerusalem (and the 70 years that are also mentioned in the PoF) and refers to “your desolate sanctuary” (v. 17), the reference does not pertain to fasting in remembrance of the destruction. It relates to Daniel’s pious personal practice of fasting regularly, not on public and memorial days. This is patently indicated by the divine response to Daniel: “Have no fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your mind to get understanding, practicing abstinence before your God . . .” (Dan 10:12). On the historical level, this attests to mourning practices in the Greek period, the time of the composition of a part of the book of Daniel; on the literary level, it depicts the ways of a righteous individual, living allegedly in the Persian period, near the time of the return to Zion (“in the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia,” Dan 10:1). Regardless of the perspective, this passage does not relate that Daniel was ac

customed to observing memorial fasts for the destruction of the Temple but fasting and “practicing abstinence before your God” (10:12) in order to improve the national circumstances. Early postbiblical sources are also silent on this matter. The book of Judith, apparently from the Persian period (Grintz 1958: 512–14), extols the practice of engaging in frequent fasting, both public (4:9–15) and individual (8:6), but contains not a hint of the memorial fasts. This might be explained by its fictional-narrative background—the Assyrian period, prior to the destruction of the Temple. However, such an explanation certainly could not be applied to the book of Baruch, which most likely was composed after the destruction of the Second Temple (Kahana 1960: 352). It consists entirely of confession, prayer, and fasting (1:5) but with no suggestion that the destruction was marked by calendrical memorial days. The Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch, which speaks at length about the mourning for Zion and mentions a seven-day fast33 in the wake of the destruction of the First Temple (9:2; 12:5; see also 21:1; 35:2–3; 47:2; 81:1–2), similarly does not claim that there were fixed memorial fasts at that time. Even in Baruch’s preaching, “Do not forget Zion, but remember the distress of Jerusalem” (31:4), he does not propose the observance of memorial fasts; nor does his depiction of the period of redemption speak of fast days that would become days of gladness. Also noteworthy is Josephus’s silence on this topic. In Jewish Antiquities, written after the destruction of the Second Temple, Josephus tells about of the fall of the First Temple, the assassination of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, and the building of the Second Temple but not about memorial fasts. In The Jewish War, his book on the destruction of the Second Temple, with an analogy to the First Temple, Josephus also does not allude to memorial fasts: “That building [the Temple], however, God, indeed long since, had sentenced to the flames; but now in the revolution of the years had arrived the fated day, the tenth of the month Lous [Ab], the day on which of old it had been burnt by the king of Babylon” (J.W. 6.4.5). And in the continuation: “And one may well marvel at the exactness of the cycle of Destiny; for, as I said, she waited until the very month and the very day on which in bygone times the temple had been burnt by the Babylonians” (J.W. 6.4.8). In 10.1, as well, Josephus summarizes the conquests and destructions of
33. The seven-day series of fasts (see 1 Sam 31:13, mentioned above) is also mentioned in the Vision of Ezra (e.g., 3:13, 20; 4:31, 35) but not as mourning; rather, seemingly as purification in preparation for “discourse” with the Almighty.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 185
Jerusalem but makes no mention of any of the memorial fasts that appear in Zechariah.34 To conclude this short survey of the early postbiblical literature, we should note that the literature of the Dead Sea sect likewise pays no heed to a practice of fasting on memorial days for the destruction. In light of the above data we may state, to paraphrase the rabbinic formulation, “if it were not for the written text, we could not say” that during the time of Zechariah fasts in commemoration of the destruction of the Temple had been observed “all these seventy years.” This written text, the PoF, is thus a lone island among all the biblical and extrabiblical sources, because it alone argues for the existence of these memorial fasts. Therefore, when examining the PoF itself, we should not take an a priori skeptical attitude toward the conclusions that many scholars derive from it. If memorial fasts were in fact observed in the time of Zechariah, then it may correctly be concluded that “the practice of fasting in an established manner on specific dates during the year most likely was rooted in Israel only after the destruction of the First Temple and in response to this event, as we learn from the section on fasts in Zechariah 7–8” (Licht 1971: 692–95). However, in light of all the testimonies cited above, we should examine whether the evidence in Zechariah 7–8 is so unequivocal that it can support an established practice of annual fasting, even without corroborating evidence.35
The Memorial Fasts as Indicated in the Prophecy of the Fasts
The PoF raises many questions of an interpretive, literary, contextual, and historical nature. My intent, however, is not to clarify all these problems but solely the ones necessary to establish the three pillars on which my hypothesis stands: (a) the manner in which the events of the national catastrophe were commemorated; (b) the number of days so observed; and (c) the degree of popular acceptance of the memorial days.
34. Following the Loeb Classical Library translation: Josephus, The Jewish War. In Ant. 14.66, p. 481, Josephus speaks of “the third month, on the Fast Day” and of ”the third month, on the day of the Fast” (14.487, p. 701). Many interpretations have been offered for the nature of this fast day, which is inconsistent with the dates in the section on fasts in Zechariah; see Tabory 1995: 399 n. 36. 35. We certainly cannot accept a more far-reaching conclusion, such as: “The practice of commemorating disasters in the life of the people seems to have been commonplace in this period (cf. Zech. 7.3, 5)” (Johnstone 1997: 263).

The Relationship between the Question and the Answer
The Problem of the Inconsistencies
There are a number of inconsistencies between the question presented to the priests and the prophets (Zech 7:3) and the response given by the prophet: (1) The question states that the “abstinence” of the questioners continued “all these years” (7:3), while in his response the prophet speaks of “all these seventy years” (v. 5). (2) The first part of the reply to the question “shall I weep and practice abstinence . . . as I have been doing?” (v. 3) is “when you fasted and lamented . . . , did you fast for My benefit?” (v. 5), and the second part of the reply (8:19) also speaks of fasts, not of abstinence. Are weeping and abstinence (rznh) identical with fasting (μwx) and lamentation? (3) The question relates to the practice “in the fifth month” (7:3), while the first answer refers to “the fifth and seventh months” (v. 5), and the second answer speaks of “the fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth month, the fast of the seventh month, and the fast of the tenth month” (8:19). The common denominator in all these inconsistencies is the ancient inclination to narrate as though with precision, while employing a “between-the-lines” rhetoric on the topic of a general, fundamental nature that exceeds the bounds of the immediate time of the narrative (as discussed above): not “all these years” but an exact number, “seventy years”; not merely “abstinence” but fasting; and not only in the fifth month but also in additional months. We therefore find that both the people who raise the questions (who are not depicted as representing all the people; see below) and the priests and prophets (to whom the queries are addressed) are not proficient on the subject under discussion. Based on an awareness of the biblical method of giving narrative expression to general situations and to abstract principles and ideas, I maintain that the PoF is a narrative36 meant to illustrate graphically the reality of a given time: some Israelites were observing mourning practices connected with the destruction of the Temple, but there was no consensus on the question of how long this practice had been in existence, nor was there general agreement concerning the manner and dates of its observance. (4) In addition to these three inconsistencies between the question and the answer, there are also differences between those to whom the
36. It does not necessarily ensue from this that what was related had no basis in reality; rather, the literary fashioning of the historical report on which the passage is founded was adapted in accordance with the orientation of the author.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 187
question is addressed (“the priests of the House of the Lord and the prophets,” 7:3) and the respondent (the prophet Zechariah); and between the questioners (Sharezer and Regem-melech, 7:2) and those to whom Zechariah’s reply is addressed (the people of Bethel).
Suggested Solutions to the Problem
(1) The wording “all these years” (7:3) alludes to one of the two following possibilities: either the author is presenting those using the phrase as not knowing how long the mourning practice in the fifth month has been observed, or he is implying that they saw no importance in being specific about it. With this background, the wording of the answer emphasizes the exact time of the establishment of the practice: “seventy years.” It is difficult to determine whether the wording “all these [hmk hz] years” refers to a lengthy period spanning decades or to a short period, of only a few years. The word pair hmk hz is a hapax legomenon. In interrogative language, which is the usual context of hmk, the word at times has an accompanying tone of multiplicity, such as in the question “How many [hmk] are the years of your life?” (Gen 47:8), which refers to the 130-year-old Jacob. “How often [many times!] did they defy him in the wilderness?” (Ps 78:40) and “How many are the days of your servant?” (Ps 119:84; they are so few!). The Septuagint seemingly is faithful to the true intent of the expression in Zech 7:3 in its rendition of μynç hmk hz as ¥kana; eßth (not posa, which is the usual translation of hmk). The use of the root akanoÍ, with the meaning ‘sufficient’, ‘suitable’, ‘satisfactory’, teaches that the translator understood hmk hz in the sense of ‘sufficient time’, noting the questioners’ intent that the time had come to stop weeping and engaging in abstinence in the fifth month. This was not necessarily because they had behaved in this manner for many years, but, most likely, because of changing circumstances. It therefore can hardly be determined whether the formulation refers to a lengthy period of “seventy years” of mourning customs.37 However, an allusion to the changed circumstances that led to the question appears in the opening of the chapter, where the date is given: “In the fourth year of King Darius” (518 b.c.e.). The foundations of the Second Temple already stood, it was obvious that it was being completed, and the questioners therefore saw fit to consider the cancelation
37. Other interpretations for the wording hmk hz in this verse were presented in the Targums and in modern commentaries: Zer-Kavod (1957), ‘so and so many years’; Mitchell (1912) translated it literally, ‘as I have done now how many years’; Meyers and Meyers (1987) rendered it ‘all these years’.

of the mourning practices that were related to the destruction of the First Temple.38 The prophet’s emphasis on “all these seventy years” in his answer refers to the continuation of the Babylonian servitude, after which the Lord would remember His people. This tradition is stated expressly in the book of Jeremiah (25:12; 29:10), in the first nocturnal vision of Zechariah (Zech 1:12), and in Chronicles (2 Chr 36:21); is alluded to in other passages (such as Jer 27:7; Ezra 1:1); and is the object of exposition and interpretation (as in Dan 9:24). The number is patently typological39 and as such need not be precisely accurate. Only the starting point of this count (and in the book of Daniel also the very term “seventy years”) is interpreted as necessary to attain the required result. In Zechariah 7–8 the starting point for the count is the year of the destruction of Jerusalem, as is indicated by Zechariah’s words in his first vision: “How long will you withhold pardon from Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, which you placed under a curse seventy years ago?” (1:12). There is no significance to the disparity of two years between the two prophecies (“of the second year of Darius,” 1:7; “in the fourth year of King Darius,” 7:1). By giving a precise answer, counting the years of fasting as seventy, the text stresses that the fasts have been universally observed, beginning immediately after the destruction of the Temple. I suggest that this emphasis should be viewed as a response to a different reality, wherein the mourning practices did not begin immediately after the destruction and certainly not among the people as a whole. First, it can hardly be assumed that, while the people were still reeling from the immediate shock of the fall of the Temple and exile, without an official leadership accepted by all, and in the absence of any history of an annual fast, a fast day would have been established and won popular acceptance. In the book of Jeremiah we read an aside (that supports our thesis) about people “from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria” who came to the site of the Temple after the destruction, “carrying meal offerings and frankincense to present at the House of the Lord” (Jer 41:5).

38. I disagree with Westermann (1969: 335) that this date is to be doubted and that we are to assume that the question was addressed to Zechariah only after the dedication of the Temple in 516, the 6th year of Darius. 39. See the recent works: Applegate 1997: 91–110 (for Zech 7:5, see p. 109); Hoffman 2001: 496–98.

tion, and it is highly likely that no fast day commemorating the catastrophe of 586 was established among the people living in the land of Israel as long as this practice was maintained. The question how long the site of the Temple ruins functioned as a ritual site is complex and deserves a separate discussion. Certainly it was used until the assassination of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam (that occurred, according to my estimate, in 582),40 and possibly even later, by those who remained in the land and were not exiled to Babylonia or to Egypt. It is plausible that those who remained sought to rehabilitate themselves. As part of this process, perhaps they also sought to restore the site of the Temple and to continue the rite there prior to or even after the assassination of Gedaliah in order not to afford the destruction a permanent status or memorialize it. The exiles in Babylonia could not have practiced mourning immediately after the destruction, since the report of it reached them only later: “In the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth day of the tenth month” (Ezek 33:21).41 We should also recall (see n. 4, above) the teaching by R. Simeon b. Yohai that the day of the report became a fixed day of mourning; accordingly, this was a solely Babylonian practice that did not begin with the actual day of the destruction but sometime later. This is definitely true for the fast of the seventh month (it could only have been established after the assassination of Gedaliah, a few years after the destruction; see above), about which the prophet was not asked but which he added to his first answer (Zech 7:5). The statement that this fast was observed for seventy years is joined to a Deuteronomistic incident that ensues indirectly from the assassination of Gedaliah in 2 Kgs 25:25–26 and Jer 41:1–10. The aim of the
40. This is the “twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar,” in which “Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, exiled 745 Judeans” (Jer 52:30), apparently in response to the assassination of Gedaliah. For a detailed treatment of the assassination of Gedaliah (Jeremiah 40–42) and the historical and historiographical conclusions that may be drawn from it concerning the extent of the exile, the Temple, and the year of the assassination, see Hoffman 2000. 41. The Peshi†ta and some mss of the Septuagint, which have “in the eleventh month,” are not to be accepted, because they most likely result from the tendency to conform to “the eleventh year” in 2 Kgs 25:2, the date of the lifting of the siege. The question of when Ezekiel learned of the destruction of the Temple is also raised by the prophecy regarding Tyre in Ezekiel 26 (the date in its heading is “in the eleventh year, on the first of the month,” 26:1) and by the continuation of the prophecy (Tyre is quoted as saying about Jerusalem, “The gateway of the peoples is broken,” v. 2). If the implication (and this is not necessarily so) is the downfall of Jerusalem, then presumably in this year Ezekiel already knew of the destruction. In this instance, we should perhaps prefer Codex A of the Septuagint, “in the twelfth year,” to that of the MT, “in the eleventh year.”

2 Kings narrative is firmly to establish in the national memory the destruction of the Temple and the exile to Babylonia as the event that brought Judah to its termination (“Thus Judah was exiled from its land,” 2 Kgs 25:21), with the assassination of Gedaliah being no more than a fleeting episode. To this end Gedaliah’s term in office is blurred, and the impression (which is probably historically erroneous) gained is that he served for less than three months, from the destruction of the Temple in the fifth month to his assassination in the seventh month.42 Additional proof that the days commemorating the destruction were not established immediately following the catastrophe may be deduced from the narratives of the destruction in 2 Kings 25 and Jeremiah 39–40. The exact time of the composition of both narratives cannot be determined, but the author patently possessed a later perspective on the events, for he already had knowledge of the exile and of the appointment and assassination of Gedaliah. He also mentions the release of Jehoiachin from prison “in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah” (2 Kgs 25:27), in 561.43 If the narrator knew that mourning practices had already been established in memory of the destruction, he would likely have alluded to these customs in his narrative,44 in the manner of the author of the book of Esther, who reports, “that is why Jews . . . observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar . . .” (Esth 9:19). It follows from this that the text of the answer in Zecha
42. For this tendency, its purpose, and the ways in which it is expressed, see Hoffman 2000; Barstad 1966. 43. However, this narrative may be a late addition, and we cannot expect from its authors what we could from the authors of the destruction narrative itself. For this episode, see Begg 1986. 44. This argument can hardly be applied to the destruction narrative in 2 Chr 36:1121. The Chronicler provided a quite abbreviated version of the destruction narrative, possibly with the aim of emphasizing the continued tie between Israel and its land, and was not interested in noting the terminal dimension of the calamity but, rather, the “continuity of Israel’s settlement” in the land of Israel (the terminology of Japhet 1989: 363–73; and also: “[In Chronicles] the dimensions of the Babylonian conquest and exile are reduced considerably; the people’s settlement in the land is portrayed as an uninterrupted continuum” [Japhet 1989: 386]). If this characterization is correct, then it may reasonably be presumed that Chronicles represents circles that did not insist on the memorial fasts commemorating the destruction of the First Temple, because they had no interest in stressing this event, which is also a proof for the differentiation of the memorial dates. Support for this hypothesis may be brought from the omission from Chronicles of any dates regarding the destruction, unlike the parallel narratives in the books of Kings and Jeremiah. Is it conceivable that the dates on which the destruction was universally commemorated with fasting and lament would not be mentioned in the narrative of the destruction itself?

riah, which determines that the fasting practices began immediately after the destruction (“seventy years”), does not reflect the reality. The actual situation is instead inferred from the wording of the question. The abstinence of the fifth month was not instituted among those dwelling in the land of Israel (and possibly not among the people exiled to Egypt after the assassination of Gedaliah) immediately after the destruction; rather, at the earliest, it was instituted only when the location of the Temple ceased to be a ritual site, following the murder of Gedaliah. A memorial day may have been established among the Babylonian exiles on the “day of the report,” that is, in the tenth month (Ezek 33:21), at least a year and a half after the fall of the Temple. This, however, is not the sole possibility. It is likely that a portion of those exiled with Jehoiachin already observed mourning practices prior to the destruction, in memory of the month of their own exile.45 If this was the case, then at least three memorial dates are plausible: the beginning of the siege and the two dates of the deportations. According to the chronicle of Nebuchadnezzar published by Wiseman (1956), the siege of Jerusalem began in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign (598), in the ninth month (Kislev), and the city fell in the month of Adar. The chronicle does not provide the date of the exile to Babylonia. The Bible, in contrast, specifies two different dates for this event: Jer 52:28 speaks of the exile “in the seventh year: 3,023 Judeans”; while 2 Kgs 24:12 states that Jehoiachin and his household were exiled “in the eighth year of his reign,” and the number of those deported was “10,000 exiles” (v. 14). Thus, there seemingly were a number of deportations (Liver 1956: 523), and it is plausible that different groups were likely to establish diverse dates to mark their separate exiles, with no common date shared by all. An additional datum that should be mentioned in this context is the prophecy in Ezek 24:15–24. The prophet is commanded not to engage in mourning for the death of his wife and to make this behavior a portent for all after the Temple was destroyed and the nation experienced catastrophe: “I am going to desecrate My Sanctuary. . . . Accordingly, you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover over your upper lips
45. According to Zer-Kavod (1957: 92), sustained mourning practices among those exiled with Jehoiachin may be inferred “based on the principle ‘from the positive we derive the negative by implication’ ”; also from Jer 29:4–6, which calls upon the exiles to build, plant gardens, and take wives. The adequacy of this evidence is doubtful. For the complexity of this passage and the conclusions that may be drawn from it regarding the views prevalent among the exiles, see Hoffman 1995: 57–72 .

nor eat the bread of men;46 and your turbans shall remain on your heads, and your sandals upon your feet. You shall not lament or weep.” Is this a mandate for the future? Or is it perhaps an apologetic for the actual reality, that the exiles of Jehoiachin did not commemorate the destruction of the Temple by engaging in mourning, possibly in contrast to the recently arrived exiles? It is difficult to decide. At any rate, all these data apparently reflect a lack of uniformity regarding the year of the initial observance of mourning practices connected with the deportations during the last years of the Judean Kingdom. The statement “all these seventy years” is therefore meant to remove this lack of unity and probably also to denote the exclusivity of the four memorial months specified in the answer: only in them is fasting to be observed, and not in others. Just as the questioners did not state a specific day for their abstinence in the fifth month,47 so the prophet does not define the days in these months in which mourning is to be observed (see below). (2) The wording of the question “Shall I weep and practice abstinence?” is taken from the realm of mourning customs, in which weeping and lament dominate in the wake of both a personal tragedy, such as “Sarah died . . . and Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her” (Gen 23:248), and a national disaster, as is indicated, for example, by the prophecy of Ezekiel cited above (Ezek 24:23). One might therefore argue that there is a chiastic relationship between the formulation of the question and that of the answer (“Shall I weep and practice abstinence?” \\ “When you fasted and lamented,” Zech 7:3, 5) and might conclude that “to practice abstinence” means to fast, as this was understood by many commentators.49 This meaning of rzn, however, is unparalleled in the Bible, and other commentators interpreted this specific language differently. The Septuagint renders this agiasma, with the meaning ‘consecration, sanctification’.50 Targum Jonathan does not use the language of μwx either but
46. An apparent reference to the mourner’s meal, as in Targum Jonathan: ˆylba μyjlw ‘mourners’ bread’. 47. There therefore is no basis for the statement by de Vaux (1965: 387) that “men fasted on the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple (Za 7:1–3).” 48. See Jer 16:6; 22:18, and more. The roots dps and hkb are juxtaposed, at times even as a hendiadys, such as in Ezek 24:16; 27:31; Esth 4:3. 49. Ibn Ezra: “That they should abstain from all delicacies and food”; R. David Kim ̇i: “That is to say, if I abstain from food and drink and from delight,” and similarly, Metzudat David; and R. Eliezer of Beaugency. Mitchell (1912: 196) renders this ‘abstain’ but with fasting implied. 50. Thus in Liddel and Scott 1961 and also in BDB: ‘dedicate, consecrate’.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 193
renders the verse: ˆynv hmk ˆnd tdb[d amk ˆyqynptm ˆyvpn [nmah (‘should I
refrain from pleasures, as I have done these many years?’). Similarly Rashi, “to refrain from pleasures. . . . hryzn always means abstinence,” who is followed by Zer-Kavod, “Shall I practice abstinence and refrain from meat and wine and other pleasures, as is the practice of mourners?” (Zer-Kavod 1957: 92). This corresponds with the rabbinic dictum: “When Ab comes in, gladness must be diminished” (m. Taoan. 4:6), because no date in the fifth month was specified. Since a month-long total fast is inconceivable, the wording rznh in the formulation of the question clearly refers to abstinence from various pleasures, possibly also in the realm of eating. In this context, we should return to the Elephantine letter mentioned above. This document also does not mention one memorial day but, rather, mourning practices that were observed over the course of years, during which people obviously could not refrain totally from eating. It follows from this that the wording rznh in the question does not refer to an absolute fast, and the response “When you fasted and lamented” (Zech 7:5) is to be understood as a stringent interpretation: “you ask regarding abstinence, while I say: an absolute fast!” Instead of general mourning practices that were observed in certain circles in the fifth month, the prophet speaks of a fast—that is, a single, stricter practice than the practice referred to by the question. This is also what we learn from the Elephantine letter, which states that the Jews of this community would wear sackcloth, conduct themselves as widows (either regarding mourning garb or regarding abstinence from sexual relations), fast, and refrain from drinking wine and anointing the body. Now, if the fast were obligatory, why would they mention refraining from the drinking of wine? Furthermore, is it conceivable that the Jews of Elephantine would have engaged in such stringent mourning practices for three consecutive years, from the destruction of their temple to the dispatch of their letter? The answer to these questions seems to be that throughout these years the Elephantine Jews engaged in mourning at different, nonfixed periods, and in diverse ways. Some fasted, others refrained from drinking wine, and the like. The plausible conclusion to be drawn from all these data is that following the destruction the various Jewish communities in and outside the land of Israel engaged in mourning practices, the precise nature of which was subject in great measure to the discretion of the individual or his close community. The prophecy was attempting to consolidate the various expressions of mourning into a uniform practice—that of a complete fast.



194 Yair Hoffman
The prophecy does not, however, contain the last step needed for the total unification of the memorial days: exact dates for the fasts were not yet established—just the months. It obviously might be argued that silence on this matter shows that the dates were clear and known to all, and therefore it presumably was unnecessary to mention them, but this argument is difficult for several reasons. First, it is puzzling that the prophet, who sought to provide exact information, would be so laconic on such an important issue. Second, the texts describing the events of the destruction exhibit no uniformity regarding dates, which reveals the existence of more than one tradition. The breaching of the city “on the ninth day” is shared by all three of the sources that report the destruction (2 Kgs 25:3; Jer 39:2; 52:6) and, although the specification of the month (“the fourth”) appears only in Jeremiah, this does not mean there were differing traditions on this point. Likewise, there are no contradictions concerning the beginning of the siege: “on the tenth day of the tenth month” (2 Kgs 25:1; Jer 52:4), although Jer 39:1 cites only the month, without indicating the day. Unanimity does not characterize the reports of the burning of the Temple, however. According to 2 Kgs 25:8, the date was “the seventh day of the fifth month,” while, according to Jer 52:12, it was “the tenth day of the fifth month.”51 The assassination of Gedaliah is dated only by the month (“the seventh”), not by the day (2 Kgs 25:25; Jer 41:1).52 Consequently, one can hardly expect uniformity in the determination of the date of the memorial day,53 and the answer by the prophet also contains no allusion to a specific day but only to the month of the fast. (3) Why does the question mention only the fifth month, while the first answer by the prophet (Zech 7:5–6) adds the seventh month, and the second answer (8:19) adds the fourth and tenth months as well? An interesting explanation for this is offered by Abrabanel in his commentary on the verse. It was clear to the questioners that the other fasts,
51. In an attempt to resolve this contradiction, the midrash explains: “On the seventh the non-Jews entered the Temple, and took the basin, the stalls, and the pillars, and they reveled with them on the seventh, the eighth, and the ninth, until the day passed away [i.e., until nightfall]. . . . When night fell they put it to the torch and it was burnt on the tenth of the month” (Mirsky 1966: 121–22). 52. The Jewish tradition that established the Fast of Gedaliah on the third of Tishrei is late and was definitely not observed in the Second Temple period, for “the third of Tishrei is mentioned in the tractate of Taanit as a day on which fasting is prohibited.” See Tabory 1995: 398. Consequently, it is doubtful if any fast in commemoration of Gedaliah was observed in the Second Temple period. 53. For the absence of dates in the destruction narrative in 2 Chr 36:11–21, see above, n. 44.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 195
which are mentioned in the continuation of the text, were canceled after the return to Zion, but “here, there remains the redoubled doubt concerning the fifth month, in which the House of the Lord was burnt and Judah was exiled.” This interpretation, however, is not to be accepted. First, as we have seen, there is no proof for the observance of mourning customs immediately after the destruction; second, Abrabanel does not thereby explain why in the first part of the answer only one fast (that of the seventh month, 7:5) is added, while two additional fasts (those of the fourth and tenth months, 8:19) are mentioned only in its second part. These difficulties also are unresolved in the commentary by Kahana (1930), who explained that they asked regarding the main fast in order to deduce an a minori ad majus argument from it: if this (“the fifth month”) is canceled, then the others certainly are abrogated. But what would they say if they were to be told only that the fifth month’s fast is not canceled; would they continue to inquire regarding the other, less “important” fasts? Moreover, if we assume that the text quotes the question exactly as it was posed (ipsissima verba), we would have to ask ourselves, why did the questioners see fit to use such concise wording and to formulate a (one-directional) a minori ad majus question; if, on the other hand, we were to assume that the text stylizes the question (and it seems that this hypothesis is preferable), then the question arises, why did the author choose to formulate the passage in a manner that creates a lack of correspondence between the question and the answer? It is our opinion that the disparity between the question and the answers reflects the situation at the time the section was formulated: some people fasted only in the fifth month but not in the others. The prophet’s answer is intended to impart the same status to other memorial months as the fast of the fifth month. These months were certainly not “invented” by him. Some were commemorated in various circles, in different communities, and there may have been pietists who observed all of them (“Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her! Join in her jubilation, all you who mourned over her,” Isa 66:10). The disparity between the formulation of the question and its answers says to us: a fast is to be observed not only in the fifth month but also in the seventh, and you should act in a similar manner in the fourth and tenth months. The graduated fashioning of the prophet’s response may express the degree of importance (or distribution) of the memorial months. In this respect, both Abrabanel and Kahana were heading in the right direction when they argued that the formulation



196 Yair Hoffman
of the question and the answer teaches the importance of the “fast of the fifth month” in relation to the other fasts (see also below). What, however, is the significance of the distinction between the first answer and the second? The conjecture (which is reasonable but can neither be proved nor refuted) that the second answer (8:19) is a late addition does not resolve this problem because, if it is a late addition, why was it separated from the main body of the answer? It must therefore be assumed that the divided and graduated structure of the answer is part of the statement itself and is part of the indirect rhetorical style—of implications “between the lines.” The prophet’s response does not completely conceal the distinction (in importance and in distribution) between the various memorial months, but it hints that such a distinction should be set aside and that it would be proper to uniformly observe all these fasts (but not others, if others had been observed, as noted above). Even this, however, is not stated expressly by the text. This is not just for the reason mentioned in the beginning of this article but also for a more substantial consideration: since fasts were not observed by the nation as a whole and not everyone performed mourning practices in all these months, then an answer such as “the abstinence in the fifth month is not to be stopped” would not have attained the goal of the PoF, which was to establish these four months, and only them, as memorial months. What is indicated by our argument, that not everyone observed all the memorial months in Zechariah’s time, is reinforced in even more certain fashion regarding the “fast of the seventh month,” assuming that this refers to the assassination of Gedaliah (see Jer 41:1–2). Who were those likely to observe mourning in commemoration of this event? The answer is, primarily those who remained in the land of Israel, whose hopes for Jewish rule, albeit under the patronage of the Babylonian king, were dashed by the murder of Gedaliah; and perhaps also those who fled to Egypt, who were loyal to the slain governor. It is unreasonable, on the other hand, that the Babylonian exiles—and later, those who returned from Babylonia—saw fit to commemorate this event, for, as far as they were concerned, Judah had come to an end with the exile, and the assassination of Gedaliah was no more than a minor episode in relation to the cataclysmic events surrounding the destruction. Furthermore, the elite among the Babylonian deportees, who led the exile community, was composed of those loyal to the royal line: Jehoiachin, Zedekiah. It is not plausible that the establishment of mourning

The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 197
practices for the death of Gedaliah was of interest to this elite, either in Babylonia or upon their return to Zion under the leadership of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, who was also from the royal family. On the contrary:54 the inclusion of the “fast of the seventh month” among the fasts connected to the destruction ensued not only from the goal of attaining uniformity but, more importantly, from the objective of reconciliation and of lessening the differences among the various factions within the Jewish population. The response therefore juxtaposes the “fast of the seventh month” with the most important of the fasts, that of the fifth month, as if to say: the fast of the seventh month is no less significant than that of the fifth month, about which you asked. Additional support for the argument that the answer by Zechariah is reflective of different realities regarding the observance of the memorial months may also be obtained from the words “the fast of the fourth month . . . and the fast of the tenth month” (8:19). The narrative relates that the delegation came “on the fourth day of the ninth month” (7:1), bearing the question “Shall I weep in the fifth month?” (v. 3). The closest memorial month to the time of the question was the tenth month, and next, the fourth month. Why did they not ask concerning them? In my opinion, the text thereby alludes, once again employing its typically indirect tactics, that the questioners had no knowledge of (or, they had this knowledge but did not observe) the mourning practices in the months between the ninth and the fifth (that is, the fast of the tenth month and the fast of the fourth month). By means of elimination we see that, at the time this section was formulated, the standing of the fifth month as commemorating the catastrophe of the Temple’s fall was stronger the standing of the other memorial months. (4) According to the text, the question was addressed to “the priests of the House of the Lord and to the prophets” (Zech 7:3), but it underlines that the prophet Zechariah, not the priests and prophets, responded to the question. What can be deduced from this inconsistency? The address to the priests is understandable, because they were considered to be the teachers of the law, as is indicated by the charge of Haggai, “Seek a ruling from the priests” (Hag 2:11), and by, “the lips of a priest guard knowledge, and men seek rulings from his mouth” (Mal 2:7).
54. Especially since Gedaliah represented allegiance to Babylonia, the rival of Persia in the not-so-distant past. Persia’s king was also Zerubbabel’s patron.



198 Yair Hoffman
The mention of “the prophets” is difficult in this context, and we should prefer the view that this text is a late addition55 that was intended to justify Zechariah’s interference in the matter. By responding to the question, Zechariah is presented as one who presumably “snatched away” the answer from the priests, as if to say: this question is not within the realm of your authority, because it is not halakhic (in other words, is not based on the Torah). This is also alluded in the rhetorical question, “did you fast for my benefit?” (7:5).56 An additional possibility that will be discussed below from the broader view of the PoF is that this is more than a formal argument about exceeding the priests’ authority. The priests who served in the Temple were, to a great degree, an “interested party”: their concern would have been to depreciate the importance of the memorial practices, which were likely to weaken the status of the Second Temple as a complete substitute for the First.57 The wording of the answer indirectly hints, in the manner of the section, that the priests are not to be consulted for a ruling concerning the commemoration of the First Temple; instead, the
55. As is maintained by Mitchell 1912: 198; Beuken 1977: 146. According to Johnson (1979: 64, 198), the reference is to cultic prophets, such as, in his opinion, Haggai and Zechariah. This was also conjectured recently by Mason 1990: 212; Cook 1995: 139. Many scholars concur regarding the priestly origin of Zechariah. That was deduced from the name of his grandfather (or father; see Ezra 6:14) Iddo, who is described as a priest (“Zechariah, of the Iddo clan,” Neh 12:16; also see Neh 12:4). See, int. al., Cassuto 1954: 924; Zer-Kavod 1957: 64; Meyers and Meyers 1987: 92; Mitchell 1912: 81–82; but there is no decisive proof for this. At any rate, Mitchell correctly notes that Zechariah’s priestly descent does not necessarily make him a representative of priestly interests; and similarly Meyers and Meyers, who state that the title of prophet that was given to him (but not to Haggai) was “setting him apart from the priestly aspect of his family background.” 56. This was noted by several commentators, such as Ibn Ezra, who writes: “I did not command you this”; and similarly, Abarbanel, 221: “Have you fasted because of My commandment and My word? Behold, I have not commanded you regarding this.” 57. A reflection of the feeling that the Second Temple could not be an equal substitute for the First Temple appears in Haggai: “Who is there left among you who saw this House in its former splendor? How does it look to you now? It must look like nothing to you. . . . The glory of this latter House shall be greater than that of the former one” (Hag 2:3–9). The wording ‘who is left?’ [raçnh], which portrays those who depreciated the worth of the Second Temple, is generally interpreted, following Ezra 3:12, as referring to the elderly returnees from the exile. But it is not inconceivable that the reference is to the elderly who remained in the land of Israel and were not exiled to Babylonia, thus emphasizing their special attitude toward the First Temple. Compare “only the poorest in the land were left” (2 Kgs 24:14); “the people whom he left in the land of Judah” (25:22); “among the people who were left in the land” (Jer 40:6); and other passages. Nonetheless, the root raç in the locative sense appears in Scripture dozens of times, not necessarily in the context of those left in the land after the exile.

The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 199
stance of the prophet, as such, is to be accepted: the memorial observances are not to be abrogated. Moreover, Zechariah’s answer is not addressed directly to the questioners from Bethel (see below) but “to all the people and to the priests” (7:5). This wording appears to be a merism: from ordinary Israelites,58 such as the questioners, to those serving in the Temple. The passage thus establishes that, not only are the priests not authorized to respond to the query, they must also accept the ruling by the prophet on this issue, even if it is not to their liking. The literary fashioning of the PoF suggests this (polemical?) stance: the author separates the question from the answer with the formula “thereupon the word of the Lord of Hosts came to me” (v. 4), in order to stress that this is not a spontaneous response by the prophet but the statement of the Lord to him on this subject. The passage thus alludes to the model that appears in the Torah: when Moses, the prophet, was asked a question for which he did not have a ready answer, he waited for the word of God, and then he delivered his ruling. This theme is transmitted as a basic principle in the Tent of Meeting narrative: “and whoever sought the Lord would go out to the Tent of Meeting. . . . Whenever Moses went out to the Tent . . . the Lord would speak to Moses” (Exod 33:7–11). A concrete example is found in the passage about the daughters of Zelophehad (Numbers 36): the family heads presented the problem to Moses, and he instructed “the Israelites, at the Lord’s bidding, saying . . .” (v. 5).59
58. This apparently is the intent of the phrase “all the people of the land” in this verse. Würthwein (1936: 51–57, 60–61), followed by others, was of the opinion that “the people of the land” in the return to Zion period is a term referring to those who remained in the land of Israel and were not exiled to Babylonia. If we were to accept this understanding, then “the people of the land” may have engaged in mourning only in commemoration of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, and they are the ones commanded by the prophet also to observe the fast of the fifth month. This interpretation, however, would force us to assume that the answer completely disregards those who asked the question, the people of Bethel (although this may be resolved by suggesting that the prophet’s words are implicitly directed also to them). Most plausible is the explanation by Nicholson (1965: 59–66) that the phrase “the people of the land” appears with a number of nuances in the Bible, including passages from the return to Zion period. We therefore should not forcibly impose the interpretation by Wurthwein here. 59. An extended example of the use of this model appears in Jer 42:7, which especially stresses that the prophet waited ten days before issuing his response to the questioners.

The Questioners and Their Place of Residence
In prophecies that are a response to a question, the Bible usually denotes the identity of the questioners if there is a direct connection between them and the content of the prophecy. However, it ignores the names when the prophecy is of a general nature. Isaiah specifies Hezekiah’s name when the question pertains to the salvation of the king’s city (Isaiah 37), and the text relates in similar fashion to Zedekiah (Jer 21:1–10) in a comparable situation. Ezekiel explicitly mentions the prince of Tyre (Ezek 28:1), with the prophecy directed to him in the wake of his statement, which is cited by the text. Jeremiah, in contrast, does not state the name of those who seek to harm him, to indicate that they come from among all the people (Jer 18:18); and similarly Ezekiel (12:21–28; 18:1). Haggai likewise does not report the names of those who claim that the time had not come for rebuilding the Temple (Hag 1:2); and similarly Malachi (Mal 2:17; 3:13). In one instance, the narrator provides the names of the leaders of the questioners in order to mark their importance, but also adds to this all “the rest of the people, great and small” (Jer 42:1) in order to level criticism at the leadership, on the one hand, and also to impose responsibility on all the people, on the other hand. The people who ask the question regarding the fasts are not anonymous. The writer supplies their names and apparently also their location (see below), even though the answers that are given are addressed to all the people. It may be concluded that the importance that the writer attributes to the identity of the questioners is not related to the answer. This piques our interest beyond the usual interpretive concern in understanding the verse “When bethel sharezer and Regem-melech and his men sent [jlçyw] to entreat the favor of the Lord” (Zech 7:2). The first problem is the identification of the subject of the verse. The singular number of the predicate, jlçyw, does not necessarily imply the single number of the subject, since there are numerous instances in which the Bible places a singular predicate before a plural subject, as is well known.60 Presumably, all the names in the verse, “Bethel,” “Sharezer,” and “Regem-melech and his men,” are the subject of jlçyw.61 In
60. Such as: “Then Moses and Aaron went [ ̊lyw]” (Exod 4:29); “Now Korah, son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, betook [jqyw] himself, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—descendants of Reuben” (Num 16:1); “Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand [dm[y] before me” (Jer 15:1); and many more examples. 61. Thus Rashi: “They were righteous individuals, and they sent from Babylonia to their relatives in the land of Israel to come to entreat the favor of the Lord in Jerusalem”; and similarly, Ibn Ezra and others.

this scenario, however, the verb jlçyw would lack a complement (although this might be interpreted as a deficient inner object: ‘and he sent who was sent’). Another prospect is the “literal interpretation”62 of bet el as a locative complement: “Sharezer and Regem-melech and his people” sent to bet el—to the House of God—that is, the Temple in Jerusalem. In the next verse, however, the Temple is called “the House of Yhwh,” and it could hardly be assumed that in our verse it would be called bet el, an appellation for the Temple that does not appear in the Bible. It is also difficult to interpret bet el as an accusative loci without the prepositional prefix (-l or la) or suffix (h—hla tyb*, casus loci). The most likely solution, albeit not free of difficulties, is to consider bet el as the subject and all the other names as the object—those sent by bet el.63 Although in this interpretation the absence of the object particle ta might pose some difficulty, this problem would exist in any scenario in which the verb has an object. This understanding of the syntax makes possible a dual interpretation of bet el: the name of an individual (in which case some scholars maintain that the full name is Bethelsharezer64) or the name of the settlement Bethel. Since there is no other instance in the Bible of bet el as a person’s name, the second possibility is to be preferred, understanding it as elliptical language or as metonymy: “the people of Bethel” (the quotation is from Ezra 2:28 = Neh 7:32)65 sent “Sharezer and Regem-melech and his people to entreat the favor of the Lord” (Zech 7:2). Similar syntax (a collective noun that requires an object in the singular) is not foreign to the language of the Bible.66
62. The wording of R. David Kim ̇i; and similarly, Abarbanel (“an allusion to the House of the Lord, and this is indeed the correct interpretation,” p. 220). This syntactical conception of bet el as the description of the place to which people were sent (accusatives directionis) is also indicated by the Septuagint: kai ezapesteilen eis Baiqhl. Thus also the Vulgate, which expressly mentions what is apparently implicit in the Septuagint, that this is an appellation for the Temple: ad domum Dei. 63. Thus, among others, Mitchell (1912: 195), who surmises that the original version was “the people of Bethel”; Meyers and Meyers 1987: 382. 64. Thus, e.g., Wellhausen 1898: 186; Noth 1928: 127–28; Hyatt 1937: 387–88; Porten 1968: 170, 328–33; Mitchell 1912: 197; Zer-Kavod 1957: 91; Mason 1990: 212. For a detailed discussion and possible interpretations of the passage, see Hanhart 1998: 462–64. 65. Thus, for example, Mitchell 1912 and Horst 1992, in their commentaries on this verse. An interpretive variation of this syntactic conception was proposed by van Hoonacker (1908), who understood bet el as an appellation for Israel, and rendered this: “La maison d’Israel envoya Schareser, ministre du roi, avec ses hommes” (cited by Beuken 1977: 144). 66. Such as ”Gilad—the Gileadites—held the fords of the Jordan” (Judg 12:5); “for Gilgal [i.e., its inhabitants] shall go into exile; and Bethel shall become a delusion”

The view that those who sent were the inhabitants of Bethel has been rejected by a number of scholars,67 who argue that the Babylonian names imply a delegation from Babylonia (to the House of God: bet el), but such a claim has no basis. First, Babylonian names could also have been given to people born in Judah; second, many, if not the majority, of the returnees to Zion were born in Babylonia and were given names that could have been Babylonian.68 It should not be assumed that as soon as they arrived in the land of Israel (or even later) they exchanged their names for Hebrew ones. Furthermore, if the intent of the text were a delegation from Babylonia, it undoubtedly would have expressly stated this, thus emphasizing the dependence of the Babylonian diaspora on decisions made in Jerusalem. It nonetheless must be conceded that even the solution I prefer is not without problems, and it is all for the best that our general argument is not dependent on any specific reading of this verse. Although it is not possible to determine the exact identity of the members of the delegation, by listing their names the text seemingly desires to express their importance, to present them as honored and authorized representatives, and in this way to show that the answer they receive to their question will be binding on the people who sent them. We do possess information, albeit scanty, regarding Bethel in the return to Zion period: the list of the returnees from the diaspora “who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city” (Ezra 2:1 = Neh 7:6), also includes “the men of Beth-el and Ai” (Ezra 2:28 = Neh 7:32).69 The delegation and the question they voiced probably reflect an issue that troubled the returnees from Babylonia. This same conclusion, with one minor change, would also be valid for the hypothesis that we rejected—that the delegation came directly from the exiles in Babylonia. Regardless of whether the delegation set out from Bethel or from Babylonia, the text clearly portrays them as representing only some of the people. This would support the assessment that the text reflects a lack of unanimity on the issue of mourning practices—in this case,

concerning their use in various communities or circles. The answer, in contrast, is directed to all the people. The outline of the passage is this: one sector of the people asks how to conduct itself, and the prophet responds with a ruling that applies to the people as a whole. He also relates what was not asked: the other memorial months and the manner in which their mourning is to be observed, which is a total fast.
Conclusion
Summary and Conclusions
The period between the return to Zion in about 540 b.c.e. and the conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 is directly documented by the Bible in the books of Haggai, Zechariah 1–8, Malachi, Ezra and Nehemiah, and apparently in Isaiah 56–66. Some scholars add to this list the book of Joel, the second half of Zechariah (chaps. 9–14 in full or in part), and a few of the Psalms. According to one school, indirect documentation of this period is found in later redactive passages dispersed throughout the various books of the Bible, including the Pentateuch; some scholars even find oblique echoes of the Persian period in all of the books of the Bible, assuming that the entire biblical literature was written during that period,70 a view that I utterly reject. A comprehensive study of this period would require a thorough analysis of all of these sources in order to determine which are really reflective of this time span. This would exceed the purview of this essay, however. It is preferable in this instance to rely solely on direct sources in order to delineate the context of the phenomenon discussed here and not to enmesh ourselves in endless conjecture. The extant testimonies suffice to inform us clearly that the society was replete with contradictions, divisions, differing positions, and clashing interests on social, economic, religious, and national questions.71 It was a formative society that was composed of recently-arrived immigrants, some of whose relatives undoubtedly remained in Babylonia; of inhabitants who had never been sent into exile; of a population that did not universally acknowledge its affiliation with the Judean people; and of many people who had married foreign women.
70. See, e.g., Davies 1992. 71. An extensive discussion of the various trends in the Second Temple period prior to the Greek conquest would lead us far beyond the current subject and would require an examination of its own. Among the important studies on this topic are Hanson 1975; Ackroyd 1968; Smith 1987: 75–112; Laato 1992.



204 Yair Hoffman
The books of Haggai and Zechariah contain many polemical statements that reflect tensions within the returnee community (Hag 1:2, 4, 9–11; 2:3, 14; Zech 1:2–6); the entire book of Malachi consists of a series of these argumentative passages. We read in the book of Ezra about a harsh rivalry between the exiles returning to Judah from Babylonia and “the adversaries of Judah” who asked to be part of the Templerebuilding community (Ezra 4:1–3), and about a rivalry with ≈rah μ[ (‘the people of the land’, v. 4); there were struggles concerning the expulsion of the foreign women (Ezra 9:1–2, 12; 10:2–44); severe social tensions (Neh 5:1–15); and stresses within the religious establishment and between them and the government (Neh 6:7–15; 7:62; 13:4–5, 1013, 22, 28–30). The necessity of forging a social contract (Nehemiah 10) is also evidence of tensions that the leadership was having to release or attenuate. One of the focal points of this friction that are clearly documented in Haggai and Zechariah pertains to the relations between Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, scion of the Davidic line, and Joshua son of Jehozadak, who occupied the post of high priest in the newly reconstructed Temple. The prophecy of Haggai that promises a far-reaching revolution, in consequence of which God says, “I will take you, O My servant Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel . . . and make you as a signet” (Hag 2:23), evinces, on the one hand, a messianic aspiration to renew the Davidic dynasty and, on the other hand, a need to moderate this ambition so that it did not lead to active rebellion against Persia. Of similar orientation is Zechariah’s admonition to Zerubbabel, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the Lord of Hosts” (Zech 4:6), with the juxtaposed assurance, “Whoever you are, O great mountain in the path of Zerubbabel, turn into level ground” (v. 7). The two verses reveal support for the messianic idea but also an attempt to temper it, so that it will not result in rash actions. In contrast to Zerubbabel, the high priest Joshua was content with maintaining the status quo, which resulted in tensions between the two leaders, echoes of which resound vibrantly in several of Zechariah’s visions. In the vision of the heavenly judgment, Joshua is depicted as being “clothed in filthy garments” (Zech 3:3)—an allusion to a grave sin. Tension is further indicated by the prophecy of the lampstand (Zechariah 4) and by the vision of the crowns (6:9–15), in each of which Zechariah plays a calming, compromising role. Granted, Joshua sinned, but he is “a brand plucked from the fire” (3:2), and his guilt has already been expunged (v. 4); “[H]armonious understanding shall prevail between them” (6:13), that is, between Joshua and Zerubbabel.



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 205
Joshua the high priest views the reconstruction of the Temple as the embodiment of redemption, and it may be presumed that the observance of mourning practices to commemorate the destruction of the First Temple would have weakened this conception, while emphasizing that the Second Temple was not an equal substitute for the Temple of Solomon. These mourning observances, on the other hand, were consistent with Zerubbabel’s intent to emphasize that the redemption was not perfect as long as the Davidic line was not restored, since the Temple was an integral part of the Davidic dynasty’s governmental system.72 Our analysis of the PoF showed that the prophecy also attested to the above-described reality of the early Second Temple period. My conclusions and their implications may be tested against this background—a society in formation, sated with tensions and conflicting interests, that was seeking to define its identity and develop its national memory by means of one of its foremost instruments for doing this, the calendar. My main conclusions are the following: (1) No fixed annual fast day, not even Yom Kippur, was observed in Israel until at least the mid–fifth century, the time of Ezra and Nehemiah. It is therefore plausible that the anchoring of such days in the calendar was the result of a development extending over many years and was not the product of a one-time decision that was implemented immediately after the destruction. (2) The various groups that were adversely affected by the fall of the Temple in disparate manners and at separate times preserved distinct collective memories of their own—those exiled with Jehoiachin, those who remained in the land of Israel, those dwelling in Babylonia who had been removed from their land in separate deportations and at different times. Each of these groups observed memorial dates of their own; and some of them possibly did not observe any mourning practices in commemoration of the destruction.
72. An example of the connection between messianic pretension and memorial fast (the ninth of Ab), the message of which is that the messianic era has not yet arrived, can be found in b. Meg. 5a–b: “R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Hanina: Rabbi [Judah haNasi] planted a shoot on Purim, and bathed in the karon [Rashi: on the market day, in public] of Sepphoris on the seventeenth of Tammuz and sought to abolish [the fast of] the ninth of Ab, but they did not consent to this. R. Abba b. Zabda said to Rabbi: This was not the case. What happened was that the ninth of Ab fell on a Sabbath, and they postponed it until after the Sabbath. Rabbi said, Since it has been postponed, let it be postponed altogether, but the Rabbis did not concur” (see also y. Meg. 1.6). Urbach (1975: 678) already ties this with R. Judah ha-Nasi’s messianic pretension, as a result of which he “wished to abolish the fast of the Ninth of Ab.” See also Tabory 1995: 403.

(3) The mourning practices themselves were not uniform: some people probably fasted, while others practiced another type of abstinence. (4) Mourning practices focused upon memorial months, and not days. Even the prophet’s answer, not merely the question, does not establish the mourning practices on specific dates but only in defined months. This last step of fixing annual memorial days on standard dates was a later phase, to which the Bible contains no reference or allusion. (5) It was the custom of some to mourn only in the fifth month, not in other months. The prophet’s answer places additional memorial months on the same level with the fifth month, thereby indirectly instructing the people not to engage in mourning on yet other commemorative dates that might have been observed by some groups within the nation. (6) The answer by Zechariah clearly inclines toward uniformity and shows a close link between all the fasts and the destruction of the Temple, “all these seventy years” (7:5). The purpose of this uniformity was not solely to bridge the various customs and create a single national practice but also to determine the proper standing of the First Temple and its destruction in the national memory. The indirect style of Zechariah’s ruling to continue and unify the commemoration of the destruction is a distinctive also observable in his other prophecies. In Zechariah 7–8, the ruling about fasting also speaks indirectly to a compromise between Zerubbabel and Joshua, between the messianic and the pragmatic. This conciliatory orientation is also evident in the fact that the list of fasts includes the Fast of Gedaliah, which memorialized a traumatic event that was most likely known only to the inhabitants of Judah and Benjamin who had not been exiled to Babylonia. (7) With the exception of Zechariah 7–8, there is no evidence of the observance of memorial fasts in Israel, either before the time of Zechariah or later, until the time of Daniel (second century). Unequivocal testimonies of the observance of memorial fasts, mainly the ninth of Ab, appear only in the Mishnah, after the destruction of the Second Temple, and the establishment of these fasts is seemingly connected with the fall of the latter. Josephus’s discussion concerning the identity of the dates for the destruction of both Temples (see above) patently reflects the goal of anchoring both in the national memory,73 and the status of
73. “Five things befell our fathers on the seventeenth of Tammuz and five on the ninth of Ab. On the seventeenth of Tammuz the Tables [of the Covenant] were broken,



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 207
the fasts mentioned in Zechariah may not have been established until the time of Josephus. All this indicates that the answer by Zechariah was not successful in implanting the destruction of the First Temple in the national memory by institutionalizing the fasts. The pragmatic need to establish a stable daily existence prevailed over the fostering of messianic hopes accompanied by yearnings for the past, and the standing of the memorial fasts was not enhanced. Notwithstanding this, the prophecy of Zechariah was undoubtedly an important factor after the destruction of the Second Temple in the formulation of the mourning practices for the national catastrophe. (8) All the above gives rise to the question of when the passage on the fasts was composed. Had the PoF truly reflected a clear reality of fixed and orderly fasts shared by the entire community, as is commonly thought, then, in light of all the above evidence, we would assign it a date later than the destruction of the Second Temple. This would have compelled us to put forth the difficult argument that entire sections were still being inserted into the canon at such a late phase. It is now obvious, however, that a late date is not necessary, because the passage reflects a completely different reality. The ancient versions, in all of which the section on the fasts is represented, also negate the possibility that this was a late addition. The time of this text must therefore be sought in a period when mourning practices were observed in varying fashions, as described above. If this is true, then there is no need to question the tradition that attributes the PoF to
the tamid daily offering ceased, the city was breached, Apostomus burnt the Torah [scrolls], and he set up an idol in the Sanctuary. On the ninth of Ab it was decreed against our fathers that they should not enter the Land of Israel, and the Temple was destroyed the first and second time, Bethar was captured, and the city was plowed up” (m. Taoan. 4:6; the talmudic discussion appears in b. Taoan. 28b–29a). If indeed some communities counted the years from the ninth of Ab, as a few scholars have suggested (see Stern 1999: 182–185, and additional literature there), then this practice also is an expression of the same trend. Yerushalmi (1982: 116 n. 22) also notes the (inaccurate, in his opinion) tradition that the expulsion from Spain occurred on the ninth of Ab. See also Yerushalmi (1982: 42–45) regarding the tendency of the collective memory to bypass, when necessary, historical knowledge. The inclination to ascribe many events to the ninth of Ab is further expressed in the tradition that the Messiah will be born on this day (thus the Sabbatean tradition of the birth of Shabbetai Zevi on the ninth of Ab). For a discussion of this topic, see Scholem 1973: 103–6. In this manner the ninth of Ab is transformed from a “historical” event to a “mythical” one. On such a transformation, see Assmann 1990: 5–33: “The mythical event is a basic pattern that recurs in the infinite repetition of rites and fasts. The historical event has an actual site, a locus in time and place, and cannot be repeated. The mythical event ‘cyclicizes’ time, the historical event linearizes it” (1990: 17).



208 Yair Hoffman
Zechariah, especially since we have seen how closely the answer given to the questions corresponds to the prophet’s goals and indirect style when dealing with controversial subjects. Nonetheless, it is not inconceivable that the PoF was not cast in a single mold, and its second part (8:19) might have been added later.
Analogies
I have suggested examining the PoF to see whether its purpose was to anchor the destruction of the First Temple in the collective memory of the returnees to Zion. I argued that the fashioning of this collective memory was bound up with disputes about differing goals and interests. Consequently, traditions had to have been established in a gradual fashion, after many transformations. In order to strengthen the theoretical aspect of this argumentation, which pertains to the manner in which collective memory is generally fashioned, my theories would have been examined best on the basis of a relevant sociological model. Unfortunately, I am not aware of such a model,74 and I seriously doubt whether it is possible to present one that is equally applicable to every society and to all the events commemorated in each society’s memory.75
74. A seminal work on this topic is the book by the French Jewish sociologist Maurice Halbwachs, which was first published in French in 1950 (English edition: Halbwachs 1992). Halbwachs stresses the gap between collective memory and historiography. Yerushalmi (1982) similarly emphasizes the continuity of the Jewish diaspora’s collective memory over the course of the millennia, in contrast to the absence of Jewish historiography from the time of Josephus until the nineteenth century. For the reciprocal relationship between collective memory and historical consciousness, see Funkenstein 1993: 321. Funkenstein defines collective memory with recourse to an analogy to language (langue, in contrast to parole, following the distinction drawn by de Saussure) as “a system of signs, symbols, and practices: memorial dates, names of places, monuments and victory arches, museums and texts, customs and manners, stereotype images . . . and even language itself” (Funkenstein 1993: 6). I concur with Funkenstein (as opposed to the position of Halbwachs and, to a certain degree, that of Yerushalmi as well) that there are reciprocal ties between the collective memory and historiographical writing, but not an unbridgeable gap. The arguments raised above concerning the historiography of the destruction generation and the connection of this generation to the practice of fasts supports this view. For a theoretical discussion of the term “collective memory,” with the adoption of a critical attitude toward Halbwachs and against the very use of the term he coined, see Gedi and Elam 1996: 30–50. Their conclusion: ”’Collective memory’ is but a misleading new name for the old familiar ‘myth’. . . . Indeed, collective memory is but a myth” (1996: 47). A discussion of the fundamental aspects of this topic is not pertinent here; my use of the term “collective memory” shows that I do not share the conclusion drawn by Gedi and Elam. 75. A discussion of the “dynamics of collective memory” is provided by Zerubavel (1995: 3–12), with a theoretical discussion also in the chapter containing her conclusions



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 209
For this reason, and because I am not a sociologist, I will seek a substitute for such a model in another, less pretentious, manner: a comparison with analogous phenomena, on which we possess clearer information.
Esther’s Fast
Current practice calls for fasting on Adar 13, in memory of the fasts mentioned in Esth 9:31. The tradition, however, originated in a later period than the time of the events in Esther. “We have not found such a fast documented in the literature of the Tannaim and Amoraim. The first mention of such a fast is in the Tractate of Soferim: ‘It is the practice of our masters in the West to afflict themselves by observing three separate days of the fast of Mordecai and Esther, that is, after Purim, Monday, Thursday, and Monday.’ ”76 Not only is this a late tradition, the rabbis disagreed regarding the date and possibly also regarding the number of days of the fast: in Babylonia they apparently fasted in a certain period on three separate days before Purim, while in the land of Israel the fasting followed the holiday. Afterward, however, the fast was observed in Babylonia on Adar 13, despite the prohibition in Megillat Taoanit on fasting on this day, because it is the “day of Nicanor.” Three points about this analogy should be mentioned in the context of the PoF in Zechariah: (1) “Esther’s Fast” was also formulated as a late tradition and was not established immediately after the institutionalization of the holiday of Purim; (2) the practice of a single fast day commemorating Purim also developed after a period in which a number of fast days were observed; and (3) different communities also commemorated the fast of Esther in disparate ways. Moreover, the Fast of Esther is a prime example of the process of the superseding of one memorial day (“the day of Nicanor”) by another, first in Babylonia, and afterward throughout the Jewish world. This supports the plausibility of the thesis that I raised (without, of course, proving it), that the establishment of four fast days in Zechariah 7–8 was intended to supplant other days that had been observed by various groups and communities.
The Contemporary “Return to Zion”
The second comparison that may add theoretical support to my argument is between the post-destruction period and the present.
76. The citation is from Tabory 1995: 405, with additional literature on this matter.
(1995: 214–37). This work, correctly, in my estimation, has no pretensions of constructing a uniform fixed model but instead concentrates on the manner in which the Zionist collective memory was fashioned.



210 Yair Hoffman
Despite the justified reservations about comparing two such distant periods, this analogy is warranted because of the many points of similarity between the modern Zionist “return to Zion” and the time of Zechariah. Both cases concern a society of Jewish oolim (immigrants; literally, ‘ascendants’), who regarded themselves as returnees to their homeland for ideological, economic, and social reasons; and both concern a land that was already inhabited, for either a long or a short time, by a diverse (Jewish and non-Jewish) population. These were and are societies forced to coalesce as a national entity in order to achieve goals, the precise definition of which is the subject of debate, accompanied by a continual struggle, both internal and external, against elements opposed to the very idea of return. On the background of these shared elements, reference should be made to a number of examples pertaining to the struggle among various groups regarding the collective memory of the Palestine British Mandate and the State of Israel in the past century (not necessarily concerning fast days). These examples are likely to shed light on the dynamics of such processes. They relate not necessarily to religion but to the formulation of a “civil religion” in Israel; however, the fasts in commemoration of the destruction in their early formative phases may also be included in this category.77 Some Israelis sought to establish the Second oAliyah as the beginning stage in the construction of the Zionist national home in modern times. Others stressed the importance of the oaliyot (movements of immigration to the land of Israel) that either preceded or followed it, while still others saw fit to establish a national tradition based specifically on the argument that Jewish settlement continuity in the land of Israel never ceased. Some people sought to establish the achievements of the “organized Yishuv” (the official establishment of the Jewish community in Palestine, including the Jewish Agency and the Hagganah) in the collective memory, while others extol the pre-State underground movements. The calendar of holidays and memorial days78 plays an extremely important role in the formulation of the national memory in contemporary times just as it did in the time of Zechariah. A study of the cal

See: “The holiday cycle can be seen as a semiotic system that offers a nonhistorical framework of representation of the past. The holiday cycle determines which aspects of the past become more central to collective memory and which are assigned to oblivion; which events are commemorated . . . and which . . . are . . . ignored” (Zerubavel 1995: 216).



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 211
endars preceding and proximate to the declaration of the State of Israel in 1948 reveals dates that were to be observed with special ceremonies in order to forge a national memory. In practice, however, many of these dates—whether of mourning, of a celebratory nature, and/or entailing a public day of rest—were observed only within certain circles and were not common to the public as a whole, in contrast to the original intent of these days. Some are still observed at present, to whatever extent, while others have faded away with the passing of time: the first of May, the work holiday of the various socialists, and the twentieth of Tammuz, the anniversary of Herzl’s death, which revisionists proposed as a holiday for the “national worker,” have both lost their attraction; Tel-Hai Day, which was once a common memorial day for commemorating national heroism, lost its status several decades ago.79 The “day of Biriyyah,” which had been established to symbolize the Jewish right to settle their land, has waned completely.80 And the list is still long.81 After the establishment of the State of Israel, some fought for the recitation of the Hallel prayer on Israel Independence Day, Iyyar 5, in order to anchor its standing as a day denoting the “first flowering of our redemption,” while others, from the ultra-orthodox faction, strongly opposed this, instead instituting it as a semi-mourning day. Recently there are those in Israel, and within the Jewish society as well, who speak of Independence Day as the Naqbah, the disaster of the Palestinians, which therefore should not be celebrated. In remembrance of the destruction of European Jewry, some place “heroism” at the center of the national memory, while others, the aspect of “Holocaust-martyrdom” (as reflected in the name of the day of Holocaust commemoration: Heroes and Martyrs Remembrance Day, hrwbghw hawçh μwy).82
79. Zerubavel (1995: 39–47, 147–77) devoted an extensive discussion to the status of Tel Hai Day. Two additional examples related to the fashioning of the national memory in contemporary Israel examined in the book are the Bar Kokhba revolt and the fall of Masada. 80. The initial settling of Biriyyah in 1946 was called “Operation Gidem” (the “onehanded,” a reference to Joseph Trumpeldor), and it is not coincidental that the date for this operation was set for Adar 11 (= Tel Hai Day, February 12, 1946). Here as well as for the destruction of the First and Second Temples, we find the tendency to link one symbolic day with another to indicate the similar nature of both. 81. For some of these memorial dates (and several others), with the drawing of a distinction between the socialist and revisionist camps before and after the establishment of the State of Israel, see Liebman and Don-Yehiya 1983. 82. On this subject see, recently, Stauber 2000.

When the question arose of determining a date for commemorating the Holocaust, one group called for linking it with the Ninth of Ab. Some seek to ensure the place of “Jerusalem Day” (Iyyar 28, the day on which Jerusalem was reunified during the Six Day War) as a holiday denoting one of the high points in the realization of the Zionist vision, while others prefer to minimalize the importance of this day. The fashioning of the national memory by means of the establishment of calendrical holidays and memorial days, the minting of coins, the issuing of stamps, the preparation of school curricula, and the like, is the subject of a continual struggle, in which there are some polar forces, while other elements in Israeli society seek to obscure the differing viewpoints and forge a common denominator, around which the national memory will be fashioned. An outstanding example of the struggle over the fashioning of the collective memory by a calendrical date is provided by the Mimunah celebrations. The establishment of this date is based on the tradition of North African Jewry, and it could have been expected that it would have been celebrated in Israel immediately upon the mass immigration to Israel from these countries in the 1950s, “all these fifty years.” This did not happen, however; not until the 1970s was the Mimunah first publicly celebrated, when the inclusion of this date in the calendar (as an optional holiday) was perceived as a social need that also reaped political rewards. However, this situation may be nothing more than a transitional phase: in recent years there has been an increasing tendency to change the ethnic nature of this day to a holiday of “national unity.” As part of the preservation and intensification of the ethnic collective memory, there are parallel attempts to anchor the status of certain days, such as the Saharanah of Kurdish Jews; the Rozah Bajh of Jews from Iran; and recently, the date of the Red Army’s victory over the Nazis (celebrated by Red Army veterans, among immigrants from the former Soviet Union). On the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the movement for Progressive (Reform) Judaism sponsored large advertisements entitled “The Fast of Yitzhak,” in which it announced that “on this day the rabbis of the movement will not conduct wedding ceremonies, nor will they hold Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebrations.” This was an additional attempt to root a fast day in the national memory. History alone will tell whether this “fast” acquired a pan-national dimension, whether it remained factional, or whether it faded with time. What is instructive, for our purposes, is that the text
spread is 12 points short



The Fasts in the Book of Zechariah 213
of the advertisement did not contain a specific date for the “fast,” and the dates it mentioned for the conducting of memorial events fell between Heshvan 10 and 13, 5760 (= October 20–23, 1999).83 The final example of the dynamics of the creation of a fixed annual date in modern Israel, albeit not in the sphere of national memory, is Mother’s Day. This day was first observed in Israel in the 1950s, on the initiative of the city of Haifa. It was then copied by other cities, where it was observed on different dates until one date was fixed for Mother’s Day throughout the country. It has recently emerged as a “Family Day,” and I am doubtful whether this is its final formulation. The above analogies do not prove any of our arguments concerning the topic of fasts in the book of Zechariah, since an example never constitutes a proof. The proofs were presented within the analysis of the text itself. However, the modern examples show that the conclusions we reached are consistent with the manner in which a national society establishes annual dates as a means of formulating its collective memory. This is always a dynamic and controversial process that takes shape in response to changing national circumstances. Although history does not repeat itself, to a certain degree “what goes around comes around.” If the past is likely to shed light on present phenomena, at times the present is capable of illuminating processes and phenomena that are hidden by the mists of the past.
83. It is also noteworthy that in previous years voices were heard calling for the observance of a memorial day for Yizhak Rabin on the Fast of Gedaliah (the third of Tishrei), thereby uniting two traumatic political assassinations. It is also instructive in this context that some contemporary Israeli calendars denote the day of Rabin’s assassination, while others make no reference to it.

Nebuchadnezzar II and the Old Testament:
History versus Ideology
Ronald H. Sack
North Carolina State University
In the month of Tashritu, 539 b.c.e., the city of Babylon fell to the armies of Cyrus the Great of Persia. According to the sixth chapter of the book of Ezra, the new “king of Babylon” issued an edict in the first year of his reign allowing the Judeans, held captive in Babylonia for almost five decades, to return to their homeland. ”Let the house (of God in Jerusalem) be rebuilt,” it read,
as a place where sacrifices are offered and fire-offerings brought. . . . Also the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar carried away from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned; they are all to be taken back to the temple in Jerusalem, and restored each to its place in the house of God. (Ezra 6:3–6)
Thus, after nearly half a century, the Judeans were on their way back to their homeland; the Babylonian Captivity had finally come to an end. Yet this event did not erase the memory of the previous fifty years from men’s minds, nor did it result (over the next several centuries) in the writing of accounts that neglected the monarch responsible for the conquest of Judah. Indeed, the name or deeds of Nebuchadnezzar II, directly or indirectly, would find their way into several books of the Old Testament, most notably 2 Kings, Jeremiah and, especially, Daniel. In addition, Josephus, writing in the first century when Judah endured a second siege led by the Roman emperor Titus, included an account of Nebuchadnezzar’s taking of Jerusalem in his Jewish Antiquities, and even specified the number of captives who (according to his narrative) were deported to Babylonia (Ant. 10.7.1). Eupolemus, a hellenized Jew of the second century b.c.e. who authored On the Kings of Judaea, also provided us with a description of Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem that is extremely important, because it represents a knowledge of both Jewish heritage and a decidedly cosmopolitan view of history that resulted from the spread of Greek ideas to the east in the time of



222 Ronald H. Sack
Alexander the Great (Wacholder 1974: 25ff.). Finally, in late Roman and Medieval times, Eusebius and Jerome composed chronicles or commentaries on books of the Old Testament that included Nebuchadnezzar’s name and a discussion of his reign. Through an examination of these works (or what portions of them survive today), one can, I believe, draw conclusions about what Nebuchadnezzar II meant to their authors and to the cultures their accounts reflect. However, what I would like to address in this essay is the question of the influences that may have been exerted on the authors of the books of the Old Testament in which Nebuchadnezzar’s name occurs or which, indirectly, refer to the king. Did they draw exclusively from a rich body of tradition that was passed on from century to century in both written and oral form, or did their accounts also reflect the impact of what I should like to call “intrusive” elements on their culture? If the latter is true, then can these elements (historical, literary or even administrative) be identified? Many years ago, when assessing our knowledge (or lack thereof) of the conquest of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great, the late Tom B. Jones made the following observation:
There are three Alexanders: the legendary Alexander, the historical Alexander, and the real Alexander. The first was born in men’s minds soon after the death of the last, and he still lives in the East as Iskander. He has been many things: a saint and a devil, a defender of civilization and a barbarian, a perfect knight and a worthless debauchee. The historical Alexander is dead, but he is frequently revived in the pages of histories and biographies that fashion him in the image that each particular age admires; in one age he may be “a greater than Napoleon,” and in another he may be the man who first dreamed of “one world.” The real Alexander died in Babylon about the thirteenth of June, 323 b.c.e. We know a little of what he did, but we shall never know what he thought or what he was like. The real Alexander is gone forever. (Jones 1966: 283)
If our intention is to examine the treatment of a figure cross-culturally, then we could, with necessary modifications accounting for time and place, substitute the date 562 b.c.e. for 323 b.c.e. and the name of Nebuchadnezzar II for Alexander the Great in the body of Jones’s remark. Even if we consider the royal inscriptions surviving from sixth-century b.c.e. Babylonia as largely formulaic in both structure and content, they nevertheless provide us with at least some detail regarding the king’s activities. In addition, the dated contract tablets not only establish the length of the king’s reign but also provide us with glimpses of daily life in a number of cities and territories that were under the sway of the



Nebuchadnezzar II and the Old Testament 223
Babylonians. Not only have many of the royal inscriptions been known and analyzed for over a century, but new ones continue to be discovered, analyzed, and published (Beaulieu 1997: 93ff.). In short, we know much more about the historical Nebuchadnezzar (from primary sources) than we do about Alexander. Our knowledge includes details of campaigns in Syria and Judah as well as important building activity in Babylon and elsewhere. As Beaulieu (1989; 1995: 969ff.), Grayson (1992: 764–66), and others have pointed out on more than one occasion, the reign of Nebuchadnezzar marks the beginning of significant, if not totally unprecedented, expansion. “Babylonia reached its greatest heights as a political power during his reign, and the Babylonian empire came to include essentially the same territory as the Assyrian empire” (Grayson 1992: 765). Despite what survives, however, one is left with the reality that our knowledge of the historical Nebuchadnezzar is deficient. The Babylonian Chronicle, which otherwise would have provided a yearly account of the king’s military campaigns, is incomplete. Comparatively speaking, we know perhaps less about the actual events of his reign than about those associated with almost any other king of the Neo-Babylonian period. As a consequence, one must resort to an examination of the legendary figure whose memory was preserved in writings representing a number of different cultures and periods of time. This is especially true since he turns up in more secondary sources for the Neo-Babylonian period than any other monarch of his dynasty, and in many of them, descriptions of the king’s deeds bear little, if any, resemblance to historical accuracy. A case in point is the History of India written by Megasthenes, an Ionian who lived at the time of Seleucus I Nicator (312–280 b.c.e.) and who included in the fourth book of his history an account of Nebuchadnezzar’s conquests in the west. “That Nabuchodrosorus . . . ,” he wrote,
having become more powerful than Hercules, invaded Libya and Iberia, . . . and when he had rendered them tributary, he extended his conquests over the inhabitants of the shores upon the right of the sea. (Cory 1876: 71)
The Seleucids, of course, took an interest in the areas of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt (Eddy 1961: 125–26). Hence it should not be surprising to find Nebuchadnezzar’s name appearing not only here but also in the Babyloniaca of Berossus, a third-century b.c.e. Babylonian priest also writing in Greek on Babylonian history. However, while Berossus’s account is strikingly similar to the language one would expect to find in



224 Ronald H. Sack
the Babylonian Chronicle, Megasthenes’ work represents a somewhat “nationalistic” characterization of Nebuchadnezzar as a sort of “world monarch.” Such a depiction is also reflected in Plutarch’s essay On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great, where the Macedonian conqueror is portrayed as being superhuman, or “god-like.” I have argued previously that these two works were intended for a Seleucid audience (Sack 1991: 97), a local Greek public that could identify itself with the times and people these men were writing about. While the building activities of Nebuchadnezzar appear to have been their primary concern, emphasis on the expansiveness of Babylonian authority through conquest would only serve further to strengthen Nebuchadnezzar’s image as the king responsible for the Neo-Babylonian Empire. At last we arrive at the characterization of Nebuchadnezzar in the books of the Old Testament, in particular, 2 Kings, Jeremiah and, of course, Daniel. These works represent the culture affected by the very conquests discussed above. They, in their own interesting ways, provide us with, perhaps, different perspectives on the “king of Babylon” responsible for the conquest of Judah and the deportation of the Judeans to Babylonia. If we begin with a focus on the book of Daniel, we find that Nebuchadnezzar’s name appears everywhere. However, Dougherty, von Soden, and others pointed out decades ago the relationship of the narrative in Daniel to the events of the reign of Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian period (Dougherty 1929; von Soden 1935). While the problems associated with Nabonidus’s origins and his seizure of power in Babylonia lie beyond the scope of this inquiry, few today would argue that the events of the reign of the historical Nabonidus were not used by the authors of the book of Daniel to enhance the image of the already legendary Nebuchadnezzar. Although the name of Nabonidus appears only once in the writings of Hebrew authors, we know from contemporary cuneiform sources (fragmentary or otherwise) that he, like Nebuchadnezzar before him, campaigned outside of Babylonia and rebuilt and/or refortified temples and cities in southern Mesopotamia (Sack 1997: 457ff.). However, he was absent from Babylon for at least ten years, during which time his son, Belshazzar, ruled the kingdom in his father’s stead. Thus, since the conquest of Judah, the capture of the city of Jerusalem, the dismantling of the temple of Solomon and the deportation of captives were acts never to be forgotten, the Hebrew writer could portray the author of such horrible deeds in such a way as, not only to emphasize the destruction and wickedness, but also to demonstrate that the apparent power or might of Nebuchadnezzar was merely the result of



Nebuchadnezzar II and the Old Testament 225
his being used as a tool in the teaching of a lesson. “In the process, however, the Hebrew writer used borrowed historical materials associated with Nabonidus, not because he was ‘confused’ but because Nabonidus appeared in his own and later sources in a way that fit the situation involving Nebuchadnezzar that was being described” (Sack 1991: 99). He did indeed have a correct knowledge of history in the postexilic period, but he represented a character as he thought he should be represented in order to fulfill the purposes of a didactic treatise. “Drawing from folklore and history, his desire was to create a figure whose attributes could be applied to any future individual monarch who dared emulate the architect of the Babylonian Captivity” (Sack 1991: 100). Among the best examples of such characterizations can be seen in the stories of Nebuchadnezzar’s disturbing dream and, especially, his supposed setting up of an image which, the Persians later claimed, represented a god whom nobody had ever seen in the country before (Pritchard 1966: 313–14). Nabonidus, of course, repaired the temples of Sin and restored his image, as he tells us in his own inscriptions (Sack 1997: 457). But the accounts in Daniel 2ff. remind us of the narrative in Genesis (40–41) where Joseph interprets the dreams of pharoah; they are characterized by virtually similar motifs inherited from wisdom literature. ”The two stories have a similar purpose—to magnify the God of Heaven over and against the heathen deities, and to paint a negative picture of the pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar while highlighting the skill and sagacity of the Jewish sage” (Sack 1991: 102). History and folklore were in harmony; only the name of the individual associated with the history was changed. If we now turn our attention to 2 Kings and, especially, Jeremiah, we find the narratives to be considerably different. The madness of Nebuchadnezzar is nowhere to be seen; neither are the dream interpreters nor the image previously foreign to the Babylonians. Instead, we read of the events prior to and immediately after the invasion of Judah, of the setting of Zedekiah on the throne of the kingdom and, ultimately, of the later return of Nebuchadnezzar’s armies and the taking of Jerusalem. We know that the “king of Babylon” captured a number of cities on his way to Jerusalem. “These Judaean cities were not plundered but were treated mercifully in a deliberate attempt to weaken the resolve of Jerusalem’s defenders” (Grayson 1992: 765). As a result, because of the treatment these cities received, Jeremiah urged his city to surrender. He had no success, however, and Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians. Nevertheless, the chapters in Jeremiah immediately preceding the account of



226 Ronald H. Sack
the fall of Jerusalem are replete with references both to territories that Nebuchadnezzar “subdued” and, specifically, to the city of Babylon itself. Nebuchadnezzar’s own contemporary cuneiform inscriptions detail his extensive building projects in his capital city. The later Greek sources (including Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus), “mythologized” his works in such a way as to represent something unreal or fantastic, in the realm of the “superhuman” (Sack 1991: 75ff.). However, the Babylon of Jeremiah is much more a symbol of power and conquest than anything else, which raises the important question of just what impact the “empire” of the Babylonians had on subject peoples, including the Judeans. Did the campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar II and their consequences represent something unique in the western fertile crescent, or were they just another manifestation of an “imperial” policy that long antedated the fall of Jerusalem in 587/586 b.c.e.? After all, Judah had been invaded and Jerusalem besieged by the Assyrian king Sennacherib over a century earlier (Luckenbill 1924: 31ff.); it would be invaded again over six centuries after Nebuchadnezzar’s death. Three decades ago, in the first volume of his proposed three-volume study of Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions, Paul Richard Berger raised the question of the influence the Babylonians may have exerted over subject peoples in the lands conquered (Berger 1973: 96ff.). Much more recently, David Stephen Vanderhooft has substantially broadened the scope of Berger’s inquiry and provided us with his own detailed analysis of both biblical text and sixth-century b.c.e. cuneiform sources (Vanderhooft 1999). If I understand his position correctly, our present evidence does not allow us to conclude any longer that Neo-Babylonian administrative or imperial policy simply involved ”a transfer of power from Nineveh to Babylon.” Instead, Nebuchadnezzar’s reign represents something different, namely, an “imperial program shaped by Nebuchadnezzar,” that, in the royal inscriptions, can be detected as “traces of a relatively coherent Neo-Babylonian period world view”; unlike the Assyrians before him, he “attempted . . . to adapt traditional Babylonian conceptions of the king’s role to the new realities of empire” (Vanderhooft 1999: 90ff.). With this I respectfully disagree. First, by Vanderhooft’s own admission, sources such as the Etemenanki inscription contain references to personnel bearing titles that are subject to varying interpretations according to context and the periods of time with which they have been associated. Consequently, the presence of such terms as sakkanaku and pihatu, long associated with Assyrian administrative tactics, in the sources for Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, suggest to me a continued use of those methods in the Neo-Babylonian period



Nebuchadnezzar II and the Old Testament 227
rather than discontinuity with the past. Second, although scholars such as Joannès have pointed out that some aspects of Assyrian provincial administration are “exceedingly rare” in the sources for Nebuchadnezzar (Joannès 1994: 21–22), one might legitimately ask the question: are they rare because they were rarely used, or are they rare only because our present knowledge does not allow us to conclude otherwise? Last, but certainly not least, information from Babylonia itself, as well as a parallel transfer of power occurring in a later time lead us to another conclusion. I shall cite two specific examples. I referred above to the reign of Nabonidus in association with the contents of the book of Daniel. If we look for a moment at just what Nabonidus tells us he did in Babylonia, then we can focus on the city of Uruk. We know that he liked to emphasize his Assyrian and Babylonian “ancestry.” He portrays his “antiquarian” and even Akkadian interests (as illustrated by his excavations at Uruk) as evidence of respect for his predecessors and of his reign’s continuity with the past (Sack 1997: 458). It also appears that he allowed the bureaucracies of such major temples as Eanna in Uruk to function largely as they had prior to his accession to the throne. Although San Nicolò, Frame, and others have debated the subject of Nabonidus’s possible “reorganization” or “intervention” in the affairs of Eanna (Frame 1991: 65ff.), there is very little evidence that anything “new” actually took place. San Nicolò pointed out decades ago that temple administrative documents clearly do contain mention of such officials as the sa res sarri bel piqitti Eanna; he concluded that, not only did these officials represent an attempt at increased royal control over temple affairs but also that this “policy” became a feature of later Achaemenid temple administration (San Nicolò 1941: 18ff.). Furthermore, Frame, when discussing the supposed “reorganization of offices in the Eanna temple and appointment of new officials” (Frame 1991: 65), cites a previously unpublished text in the Princeton Theological Seminary collection (no. 2097) in which, he states, ”we see the first appearance of the title (and presumably official position) sa res sarri bel piqitti Eanna (‘royal official and supervisor of Eanna’) early in Nabonidus’s reign (Frame 1991: 65). This “new position,” he concludes, was only one of ”a number of administrative reforms or changes involving the Eanna temple at Uruk” (1991: 79) for which Nabonidus was responsible. It is true that previously published texts from the Neo-Babylonian period suggested an absence of this “official” prior to 555 b.c.e. Yet the holder of this supposed “new position,” a certain Nabû-sarra-ußur, is attested in the documents from Eanna as early as the 33d year of

Nebuchadnezzar, where he is found bearing the title sa res sarri. In addition, it was recently pointed out (Sack 1995: 431) that evidence from the Eanna temple (contained in texts from the very same Princeton Theological Seminary collection that were then and, regrettably, are still unpublished) clearly shows that the longer official title did not first appear with the reign of Nabonidus; text no. 74 clearly shows that it was well established as early as at least the 8th year of Nebuchadnezzar. The two officials existed side by side. If anything, royal intervention or control of temple affairs was an established fact long before Nabonidus became king. What Frame refers to as “the good old days” were alive and well with regard to temple administration throughout the duration of the dynasty. Nabonidus was no different from his predecessors in “attempting to consolidate and extend his authority . . . in conformity with the Neo-Babylonian respect for the past and with a desire to connect himself with earlier kings of Babylonia” (Frame 1991: 79). Indeed, Nabonidus, Neriglissar, and Nebuchadnezzar may have acted according to a tradition going back to at least the Neo-Assyrian period (Sack 1995: 425ff.; 1994b: 1ff.; 1994a: 16ff.). Frame was certainly correct when he concluded, “a thorough study of temple and court officials in the Neo-Babylonian period is much needed” (Frame 1991: 79). If we turn the clock ahead and examine Babylonia and the Levant in the Seleucid period, then we can also address the question of the impact that Macedonian conquest had on the same geographical area. Plutarch, a Macedonian himself writing nearly 500 years after Alexander’s death, attacked the notion that Alexander the Great detested anything thought to be Persian (including provincial administration) and thus did away with it (Bailkey 1995: 298ff.). Amelie Kuhrt, in assessing the impact hellenism had on the east, observed over a decade ago that ”the conquest of Alexander was thus in Babylonian terms not a major disruption” with “no immediate or sudden change in political, cultural or religious life” (Kuhrt 1987: 49–50). She further concluded that, “not only did the Persians not destroy Babylonian temples, they had clearly wrought little perceptible change on traditional Babylonian royal ideology” (1987: 50). When focusing on Seleucid Babylonia in general, and Babylon and Uruk in particular, Susan Sherwin-White and R. J. van der Spek concluded that “ancient Babylonian cities followed their own traditional life, religion and institutions. . . . [T]hey did not try to adapt their institutions to Greek customs” (van der Spek 1987: 74; SherwinWhite 1987: 2–31). Studies of hellenistic Syria and Judea by Fergus Millar and others came to the same conclusion (Millar 1987: 110ff.).

Nebuchadnezzar II and the Old Testament 229
During the period 1986–88, several Achaemenid history workshops were held in Groningen (Kuhrt and Sancisi-Weerdenburg 1990: 128). They examined, among other things, the question of the nature of the empire created as a result of the conquests of Cyrus II and Darius I. Aside from its size, was it truly a Persian empire or an empire ruled by Persians? I should like to pose the same question with regard to the empire resulting from the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar II. Was it truly a Babylonian empire or an empire ruled by Babylonians? We have already noted that the expansion outside of Babylonia that took place in the first half of the sixth century b.c.e. was unprecedented. Tension between Assyrians and Babylonians, culminating in the revolt of Nabopolassar and in the establishment of a dynasty ruling from Babylon, was followed by the conquest of Judah, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the deportation of captives to Babylonia. These events, however, did not mean that the Babylonians were not influenced by their Assyrian predecessors (Brinkman 1984: 13–34). It is my view that available evidence does not warrant our drawing a conclusion that the Neo-Babylonian Empire represented, either administratively or in terms of conquest, a decided break with the Assyrian past. As Grayson has noted, the image of Nebuchadnezzar II in his own royal inscriptions is one of a pious ruler who was, nevertheless, a “vigorous warrior” (Grayson 1992: 767). Hence, the contents of the book of Jeremiah (which, like the book of Daniel, appeared in its final form long after the exilic period; Millar 1987: 110) represent both the historical Nebuchadnezzar as the monarch responsible for the conquest of Judah and the city of Babylon as the symbol of conquest that, sooner or later, would suffer the same fate. From there, the Hebrew writer could take the next step and develop a characterization that no longer harmonized with historical accuracy and could easily be related to the rule of any monarch at any point in time (Sack 1991: 103). Thus, the authors of Esther Rabbah could refer to Nebuchadnezzar’s leading “Decumanian and Augustan legions” into Judah in order to “destroy the temple” (1991: 103–4). The later, Arabic Chronology of Ancient Nations by Albiruni, much more concerned with historical accuracy, could, as a result, conclude that
Nebukadnezar came to Jerusalem nearly four hundred and forty-five years before the death of John; and the second destruction was the work of the Greek kings Vespasian and Titus. But it seems that the people of Jerusalem call everybody who destroyed their town Nebukadnezar. (Albiruni 1879: 297)



230 Ronald H. Sack
The last statement of Albiruni, perhaps, is the most important of those found in the Arabic sources. It best speaks to the question of the relationship of culture to the characterization of a nominally historical figure. Clearly the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple of Solomon by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 b.c.e. were bitter pills to swallow; in addition, the deportation to Babylon added fuel to an already kindled flame, resulting in the association of anything destructive or wicked in the postexilic period with the character of Nebuchadnezzar. To this image the Jews attached purely folkloristic elements for various purposes at various times, elements that enable the true historical figure to become lost in a picture intended to preserve memory of the Babylonian captivity. History had become mythhistory; characterizations knew no limits of time or space and were applicable to all periods of history. In presenting my own conclusions, I am constantly reminded of the advice of W. G. Lambert who, when addressing the topic of the background of the Jewish apocalyptic, cautioned us all (Lambert 1978: 3ff.) not to derive conclusions from surviving source material as though it were the whole. The picture of Nebuchadnezzar as a king whose dwelling place was with the “beasts of the field” or of someone’s appearance after a long stay in prison may, indeed, not be a single item of tradition. The combining of traditions related to Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus may not depend on simply the few surviving bits or pieces of information. No doubt there was much more at an earlier time (probably written in Aramaic) of which we know nothing, of course. Thus, I recognize that caution must be taken to avoid being too specific when only general conclusions (in some cases) from similarities found in the sources are justified. As a consequence, it may be that I have not adequately accounted for the expansion to the west that Nebuchadnezzar’s conquests reflect or accurately analyzed or represented the nature of administration in territories subject to Babylonian authority (Grayson 1995: 959–68). It is certainly true that some of the conclusions that both I and others have drawn with regard to the characteristics of cities (including Babylon) and territories outside of Babylonia in the Seleucid period rest largely on evidence contained in administrative documents from Uruk. It also appears that opposition to the succession of a number of monarchs apparently emerged at various times and, thus, the presence of an official such as the “royal officer and supervisor of Eanna” in temple administrative documents should not be surprising. However, we must also not rule out the possibility that folkloristic motifs were



Nebuchadnezzar II and the Old Testament 231
attached to Nebuchadnezzar long before the books of Daniel and Jeremiah were put in their present form, and quite apart from Nabonidus. The book of Jeremiah may represent the simple attachment of traditional folkloristic elements to Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon that represent no connection at all to a Babylonian imperial or administrative policy. The “king of Babylon” was a conqueror whose kingdom would be brought to its knees by conquest. Let us hope that future discoveries and research will provide a more complete understanding of the sources already known and the cultural relationships that may have then existed and influenced their contents.

in the West:
Royal Practice and Rhetoric

Between the mid–eighth and mid–sixth centuries b.c.e., the numerous small kingdoms of the southern Levant experienced wrenching transformations as they came under the influence of the powerful Mesopotamian empires, first the Assyrian and then the Babylonian. The two imperial states did not influence these western kingdoms in identical ways, however, and did not install identical administrative mechanisms to exert their influence in the Levant. The characteristics, logic, and consequences of Babylonian hegemony in the southern Levant and Judah, particularly during the reign of Nebuchadrezzar II (605562), deserve further investigation (see recently Lipschits 1998). Too little evidence exists to support the claim that the Babylonians installed an effective imperial administration in these regions during Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, and the absence of such an administration, coupled with repeated military incursions, decisively shaped Judahite historiography of the period. Mario Liverani developed a helpful approach to the study of ancient empires in his programmatic essay on Assyrian imperialism (Liverani 1979; Larsen 1979). Liverani argued that the Assyrian imperial ideology was, at base, a blunt instrument designed to justify “unbalance and exploitation.” In his view, the phenomenon of imperialism develops to effect “the dominion of the few over the many, the surrender of wealth by classes or groups of producers in favour of non-producing consumers, [and] the delegation of political decisions in favour of
Author’s note: I would like to thank Prof. Oded Lipschits for the invitation to attend the Tel Aviv conference and for his many kindnesses.

groups which have different interests” (Liverani 1979: 297). Whether or not one agrees with Liverani’s understanding of the causes of imperialism, he outlined an approach that remains heuristically useful for the historian. Imperial control is effected, on the one hand, through a series of individual actions: economic, demographic, technological, and so on. Such individual actions—like the “history of events,” in the language of the Annales School—can be reconstructed by the modern historian, given sufficient evidence. Thus, for example, the Babylonian Chronicle (Grayson 1975: 100, obv. 18) and modern archaeological data (Stager 1996) converge to prove that the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Philistine city of Ashkelon in December of
604 b.c.e.
In addition to such individual actions, Liverani argued that a complex ideological system developed to facilitate the actions of empire. This system served, in his view, to justify unbalance and exploitation and was promoted by the principal beneficiaries of the imperial system. He also suggested that the Assyrian imperial ideology, known mainly from the royal inscriptions and monuments, possessed its own “grammar,” susceptible to analysis as part of a coherent system (Liverani 1979). For Liverani, this imperial ideology represented a “false consciousness,” and the historian ought to try to uncover the “real” motivations for empire. This remains a problematic endeavor and runs the risk of elevating the economic motivation for imperial expansion, for example, to the status of prime mover in historical reconstruction. Despite this danger in Liverani’s approach, however, he is right that the modern historian can describe imperialism in terms of the mechanisms of empire and in terms of the rhetoric of imperialism. This schematic model can illuminate the period when the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar began to influence the Levant. The historian can sketch in outline some of the distinctive features of Babylonian imperial control in the Levant at the practical level and some of the distinctive features of Babylonian imperial rhetoric. The combination of practical and rhetorical elements of the Babylonians helped to shape the historiographical perspectives of subject populations, particularly Judah. In 605 b.c.e., Babylonian forces led by Nebuchadnezzar, Crown Prince of Babylon, defeated Pharaoh Necho of Egypt at Carchemish (Grayson 1975: 99, obv. 2–5). The Babylonians thus curtailed Egyptian influence in Syria and became the dominant military force in the region. It is important to recall, however, that by 605 direct Assyrian control of the southern Levant had been defunct for two and perhaps as



Babylonian Strategies of Imperial Control in the West 237
many as three decades (Ephoal 1979). Despite this, modern historians have characteristically asserted that the Babylonians not only inherited the territory that the Assyrians had controlled but also the administrative apparatus of the Assyrian Empire. A. K. Grayson, in discussing the fall of Assyria, argued that “the event was . . . a transfer of power from Nineveh to Babylon. The geography of the empire and its administration remained basically the same and there was no prolonged period without a central authority” (Grayson 1991a: 161). A. L. Oppenheim suggested that Nebuchadnezzar “invaded and took over the provinces of the Assyrian Empire from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf” (Oppenheim 1979: 163). Y. Aharoni argued that “the Babylonians generally did not introduce changes in the provincial organization which they inherited from Assyria” (Aharoni 1979: 408). A. Kuhrt, expressing more caution, recently made a similar argument: “The system of provinces and the duties of governors were probably organised along lines analogous to the earlier Assyrian ones” (Kuhrt 1995: 607). The assertion that Babylon was a direct and substantial successor of Assyrian imperial territory and procedures in the Levant, however, does not bear scrutiny. The Sargonid kings of Assyria, famously, annexed many Levantine kingdoms and transformed some into provinces of Assyria—ana mißir mat Assur utîr, in the Assyrian idiom (for a survey, see, for example, Grayson 1995). Some of the geographical divisions that the Assyrian kings established or consolidated in the Levant did subsequently form the basis for local control (Forrer 1920; Parpola and Porter 2001). One thinks, for example, of the province of Samerina, named for its capital, Samaria, which persisted under the name Samerina (Heb. Somérôn) after the Assyrians created it in 722/21 (Ezra 4:9–10; Becking 1992; Naaaman and Zadok 2000). Nevertheless, Assyrian provincial governmental structures had dissolved in Samerina and elsewhere in the Levant before Nebuchadnezzar’s time. Shomérôn, thus, may have persisted as the name of a geographical entity (for example, Jer 31:5), but it was no longer a provincial unit. And in a number of other cases in the southern Levant, royal regimes were resuscitated in areas or citystates that had previously been transformed into Assyrian administered provinces. This may have been the case especially in the coastal zones of Phoenicia and Philistia. In 738, Tiglath-pileser III transformed Íimirra into the main Assyrian province on the coast of Phoenicia. The island city of Arwad in northern Phoenicia was likely subsumed into the province at that time (Tadmor 1994: Summ. 4:1’–5’; 8:8’–9’; and possibly 9:rev. 1–2). We know, however,



238 David Vanderhooft
about several kings of Arwad in the reigns of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal, including Iakinlu and his son Azibaoal, whom Assurbanipal appointed in his third campaign (Borger 1996: 19 C II 46). It remains a question whether Arwad retained its monarch after the mid-660s, or whether an Assyrian administrator governed the city, perhaps from Íimirra. The mainland Assyrian province of Íimirra possessed an Assyrian governor (sakin mati), Mannu-ki-ahhe, even after Assurbanipal’s death; he is mentioned among the postcanonical Assyrian eponyms (Millard 1994: 99). Not later than the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, however, Arwad certainly possessed a monarch: a king of Arwad is mentioned by title in Nebuchadnezzar’s Istanbul Prism inscription (Unger 1970: 286 v 26), which Landsberger rightly dated to 598/97, Nebuchadnezzar’s 7th regnal year (Landsberger 1933: 298).1 South of the Assyrian province of Íimirra, Esarhaddon razed Sidon in 677 and beheaded its king, Abdimilkutti; Esarhaddon built the town of Kar-Esarhaddon in its stead, organized the area as a province, and installed one of his sut-resi officials there as governor (Borger 1956: 48 ii 65–iii 19; Grayson 1975: 83 iv 3–7). Significantly, Nebuchadnezzar’s Istanbul inscription confirms that by 598, Sidon, like Arwad, possessed a king, not a governor (Unger 1970: 286 v 25). The construction of the karu and the Assyrian reorganization of Sidon’s administration cannot have been cosmetic (contra Naaaman 2000: 40 n. 27). The fact that the Assyrian provincialization of Sidon did not persist into the Babylonian period, then, proves that Nebuchadnezzar cannot have simply inherited the Assyrian provincial system. Farther to the south, Esarhaddon annexed the territory of mainland Tyre a few years after the provincialization of Sidon (Borger 1956: 110 rev. 9–10). Tyre may have been formally transformed into a province only under Assurbanipal (Naaaman 1995: 109). In any case, Tyre, like Sidon and Arwad, was governed by a king no later than the 7th year of Nebuchadnezzar (Unger 1970: 286 v 23). The incorporation of these Phoenician city-states into the Assyrian province system, thus, did not persist into the early Babylonian period. Nebuchadnezzar’s Istanbul Prism enumerates at least two additional kings (and probably more, but the text is broken) who were obligated to contribute to Babylonian building programs. The first is

listed as LUGAL sa kurmir-[. . .] ‘king of (the land of) Mir[. . .]’, but the place-name is entirely missing for the last king (Unger 1970: 286 v 2829). Although the first partial toponym should be sought in SyriaPalestine, like all the others in the text, it has resisted identification. Naaaman recently made the ingenious suggestion that this might be an abbreviated writing of Samsimuruna, where the first element, Samsi (Samsi), has been dropped (Naaaman 2000: 41). Samsimuruna, an Assyrian provincial capital, was perhaps located on the Mediterranean coast just north of the Nahr al-Kalb (Naaaman 1995: 109). If Naaaman’s restoration of the prism text is correct, it would constitute evidence for another Phoenician city-state that was governed by a king at the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. Farther south on the coast, Dor was apparently also transformed into the capital of an Assyrian province, although textual sources do not explicitly say so (Stern 1994: 131–45; 2001: 65–68; Naaaman 1995: 106). No archaeological evidence of its destruction at the end of the Assyrian period exists, and the nature of the local administration during the Babylonian period remains unknown. Stern suggested, based on his assumption that there was continuity between the Assyrian and Babylonian administrations, that Dor continued as a provincial capital in the Babylonian period. No stratum associated with this period has been isolated, however, and Stern has become less sanguine about the suggestion (1994: 147; 2001: 315–16). It is equally possible that after the Assyrian period Dor possessed its own king, or came under the control of Tyre. In Philistia, the situation is less clear and the provincial divisions established by the Assyrian kings remain opaque. Sargon II established Ashdod as a province after 711 and placed a sut-resi official there to administer it (Fuchs 1998: 44 VII.a:13–15; 44–46 VII.b:1–48; and for discussion, see pp. 124–31). We learn from the inscriptions of Sennacherib, however, that a king of Ashdod, Mitinti, paid tribute only about a decade later. Subsequently, the Assyrian eponym chronicle records that Samas-kasid-ayabi, the Assyrian saknu of Ashdod, served as limmu in 669 (Millard 1994: 52; Reade and Finkel 1998: 253). At nearly the same time, however, Ahimilki ruled as king of Ashdod (Borger 1956: 60 v 62). Given this oscillation between references to native kings and Assyrian governors, it seems possible, as Tadmor suggested, that Ashdod was permitted to retain its royal seat alongside that of the Assyrian prefect, perhaps an exceptional circumstance (Tadmor 1966; also Cogan 1993: 406–8). By the beginning of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, however,



240 David Vanderhooft
Ashdod possessed a king, as the Istanbul prism indicates (Unger 1970: 286 v 27). No evidence points to the installation of any Babylonian administrators at Ashdod. According to the Babylonian Chronicle (Grayson 1975: 100, obv. 18) and the Weidner tablets (Weidner 1939: 928), Ashkelon was ruled by a king, Aga, at the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign; Aga was perhaps killed or deported along with his sons when the city was destroyed in 604. Ashkelon was abandoned until the Persian period, and there is no indication that the Babylonians installed any kind of administration in the vicinity.2 Gaza also possessed a king who was a client of Nebuchadnezzar in 598, according to the Istanbul prism (Unger 1970: 286 v 24). The so-called Saqqarah papyrus may illuminate the status of another kingdom in Philistia in the early years of Nebuchadnezzar. This Aramaic letter was addressed to the king of Egypt by a client who calls himself “Adon, king of [. . .],” or “Adonimelek.” He claims the status of obd ‘servant’ of Pharaoh and requests military assistance against the king of Babylon, no doubt Nebuchadnezzar, whose troops had reached Aphek (Dussaud 1948). Porten argued that the Hieratic docket on the outside of the papyrus identified the city as Ekron in Philistia (Porten 1981: 43–45). What seems clear enough, even if Adon wrote from somewhere other than Ekron, is that the city-states of Philistia were ruled by independent kings at the beginning of the Babylonian period. To reduce the opportunity for Egyptian encroachment, Nebuchadnezzar rapidly overran the region upon his accession, but there is no evidence that he installed an imperial administration to replace the local ones. The evidence reviewed above indicates that in Phoenicia and Philistia at the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, local governance was in the hands of independent kings. Available evidence does not point to the installation of Babylonian administrators when these cities were captured. Whatever Assyrian provincial administration had been established earlier in the seventh century was a thing of the past. For other areas of the Levant we have relatively little precise information about Babylonian practices upon Nebuchadnezzar’s arrival. He conquered the region of Hamath in the year before his accession to the throne (Grayson 1975: 99, obv. 6–8). There is some ambiguity about whether Hamath was made into a Neo-Assyrian province (Naaaman 1999: 426), so the use of the phrase pihat kurHamatu ‘district of Hamath’ in the Babylonian Chronicle (Grayson 1975: 99, obv. 6) may not reflect

Babylonian Strategies of Imperial Control in the West 241
Assyrian organization or diction (see below). Apart from Hamath, the Babylonian Chronicle notes for Nebuchadnezzar’s first regnal year, 604/3, that ‘all the kings of Hatti’ (sarrani sa Hattu kalisunu) came before him and he received ‘their vast tribute’ (bilassunu kabittu; Grayson 1975: 100, obv. 17). A similar, but partially preserved, statement about the kings of Hatti is repeated for his 10th year, 595/4 (Grayson 1975: 102, rev. 23–24). The entries for 605 and 602 state simply that Nebuchadnezzar carried the “heavy” or “vast” biltu ‘tribute’ of Hatti back to Babylon, no doubt after he received it from subjugated kings (Grayson 1975: 100, obv. 13; 101, rev. 4). In the entries for 605, 604, 601, and probably 603, the Chronicle claims that Nebuchadnezzar ‘marched about victoriously in Hatti’ (ina kurHatti sal†anis ittalak; Grayson 1975: 100, obv. 12–13; 100, obv. 16; 101, rev. 5; 100, obv. 23?). Hatti in the Chronicles is a vaguely defined geographical term which embraced Syria–Palestine (Hawkins 1973: 154–55). An unpublished exemplar of Nebuchadnezzar’s Etemenanki cylinder in the Harvard Semitic museum (of uncertain date) uniquely states that he conscripted ‘all the kings of Ebir Nari’ (lugal. meß sa e-bé-er na-[a-ri])3 to construct the ziqqurat of Marduk in Babylon. Scholars have long been inclined to take all such statements literally: that all the kings in Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean corridor were immediately subjugated and paid tribute. This interpretation dominated already in antiquity (see 2 Kgs 24:7; Josephus, Ant. 10.86; Berossus in Josephus, Ag. Ap. 1.136; see also the helpful review of Sack 1991: 56–71). Overall, however, little precise information about the geography of Hatti or its kings was included by scribes of the Chronicle and the royal inscriptions. The Chronicle, for example, does not name the place where the Babylonian and Egyptian armies clashed in 601, while it provides only a vague account of a campaign against the Arabs (Ephoal 1982: 171–76). We do learn that Nebuchadnezzar razed Ashkelon (604); captured Jerusalem (597); and invested another town, whose name is not preserved (possibly Kumuhu; see Naaaman 1992). Most of the notices concerning the Levant in the first twelve years of Nebuchadnezzar, however, are generalized notices either about the receipt of tribute or about Nebuchadnezzar’s having “marched about victoriously” in Hatti. Does this suggest that the region was already well organized administratively in the early reign of Nebuchadnezzar or that its independent kingdoms were rapidly incorporated into an imperial bureaucratic system?

Perhaps not. In fact, Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant at least nine times in his first twelve regnal years (including his accession year). The Chronicle creates the impression of a sweeping conquest of Hatti during these first twelve years; the impression is achieved partly through repeated use of the locution sal†anis ittallak and partly through rhetorical embellishment of several key conquests (Ashkelon and Jerusalem, for example). One is reminded, however, of what Halpern has called the “Tiglath-pileser principle.” Halpern points out that Tiglathpileser I (1114–1076) claimed in his annals that he crossed the Euphrates 28 times during his career, including twice in one year, to battle the ahlamû-Aramaeans. When the annals state categorically that he brought about their defeat (dabdâsunu lu askun, Grayson 1991b: 43, A.0.87.4:34–36), the historian may well question the thoroughness of the accomplishment. The royal scribes maximize the regent’s achievements, but without overt prevarication (Tiglath-pileser no doubt skirmished with the Aramaeans); they put maximal spin on minimal accomplishments, but without fabricating them (Halpern 2001: 12432). On this principle, and allowing for the difference in genres between annals and chronicles, it is interesting to note what the scribes of the Babylonian Chronicle fail to say. Although Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in Syria–Palestine nine times in his first twelve years—a fact that is itself a concession to his failure to subjugate its kings rapidly—he makes no claims for annexation of territory or the installation of Babylonian officials to rule them. He pushed Egypt out of Syria in 605 but fought to a stalemate with Egypt in 601. He collected tribute, but the Chronicle usually asserts simply that this came from all the kings of Hatti.4 Do his achievements in Hatti, as reported in the Chronicle, reflect an effort to consolidate or install an imperial bureaucracy in the Levant during these twelve years? The available evidence points less to maintenance or installation of an imperial system on the model of Assyria than to an ad hoc program focused on the collection of tribute from client kings, some of whom repeatedly tested the limits of their status as clients. Nebuchadnezzar’s related goal, as Stager argued and as Lipschits also recently emphasized, was a desire to stem potential Egyptian encroachment into the Levant, which explains the Chronicle’s precision in reporting the sack of Ashkelon and Jerusalem, both border king

doms (Stager 1996; Lipschits 1998: 470). Nebuchadnezzar did not immediately achieve this goal with the thoroughness his design must have dictated, and the scribes of the Chronicle could not conceive of a way to claim even a partial victory against Egypt in 601. There is no disputing that Nebuchadnezzar led the dominant military force in the Levant during his long reign: this is no doubt recounted more fully in the unrecovered portions of the Chronicle postdating his twelfth year, and it is certainly attested in the material record of destruction in the region. For the Levantine coastal zone, however, the historian must be cautious before asserting that Nebuchadnezzar inherited or perpetuated the Assyrian provincial administration or that he developed one like it. Nebuchadnezzar seems rather to have established his control in the Levant through the subjugation of a network of client kings. This is reflected in Jeremiah 27 as well. In this text we read of a summit in Jerusalem of the emissaries of Levantine kings who conspired to resist Nebuchadnezzar, probably in 594 b.c.e., his 11th regnal year.5 Jeremiah notes the presence in Jerusalem of envoys of the kings of Sidon and Tyre,6 and the Transjordanian states of Moab, Ammon, and Edom. These are warned that their contemplated resistance to Nebuchadnezzar is futile, for God has placed ‘all these lands’ (kol haaåraßôt haaelleh, v. 6) into his hand. ‘Many nations (gôyim rabbîm) and great kings (mélakîm gédôlîm7)’ (v. 7)—designations that pertain to independent polities—will come under his control, or perish in their resistance. According to the prophet, God will permit any nation (gôy) that brings its neck under Nebuchadnezzar’s yoke to remain on its own land, to “work it” (27:11). Jeremiah’s oracle paints a picture of Nebuchadnezzar as God’s servant working to subdue refractory kings among Judah’s neighboring kingdoms. The language of Jeremiah’s oracle dovetails with the other evidence about Nebuchadnezzar’s interaction with independent kings throughout the Levant. It does not suggest that Nebuchadnezzar inherited or built upon the older Assyrian provincial administration in the region, or that he attempted to install a similar

one. He made the petty kings of the Levant into clients and required tribute payments; refractory kings would be punished, and conquered people were sometimes exiled to Babylonia. In Judah, which had retained its king through the Assyrian period and had not been transformed into a province, Nebuchadnezzar deposed king Jehoiachin in 597 and replaced him with Zedekiah (2 Kgs 24:12–17), whom the Babylonian hoped would be more compliant. That hope proved to be misplaced, and Zedekiah rejected his status as a Babylonian client about 588, whereupon Nebuchadnezzar initiated a siege of Jerusalem and took it in 586 (2 Kgs 24:20–25:10). But what happened in the kingdom after the sack of Jerusalem? It is often assumed that after the deportation of the king and part of the population, and after the destruction of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar transformed Judah into a Babylonian province when he appointed, hipqîd, the Judean nobleman Gedaliah ben A ̇ikam (2 Kgs 25:22–23; Jer 40:7). Cogan and Tadmor, and also Machinist, have noted, however, that the biblical text does not specify Gedaliah’s office or Judah’s status (Cogan and Tadmor 1988: 327; Machinist 1992: 79; also Becking 1997). When Gedaliah and the “Chaldeans” supporting him in Mizpah were killed sometime soon afterwards, we learn of no effort by the Babylonians to install a replacement. Only the assumption that Babylonian procedures mimicked Assyrian ones would require the supposition that Judah became a Babylonian province under the rule of a series of governors (thus Barstad 1996: 41–43; and Lipschits 1998: 483). This is one suggestion forwarded recently in a superb paper by Naaaman, with which I disagree (2000: 35–44). This is not to say that the Babylonians did not impose any control in the Levant under Nebuchadnezzar. There are textual (but scant material) indications for the installation of a few Babylonian garrisons in the west before and during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Nabopolassar, in his 16th year (610), defeated the Assyrian king Ashur-uballit II at Harran. The Babylonian king then installed a garrison (sulûtu) in the city, which was in turn reduced by the Assyrians and Egyptians the following year (Grayson 1975: 96 68). In Nabopolassar’s 19th year (607), the king captured Kimuhu on the Upper Euphrates and installed a garrison (sulûtu) there that was again reduced by the Egyptians the following year (Grayson 1975: 97 13–15). These garrisons were obviously small outposts designed to maintain a formal presence in the city and did not represent field forces. The Babylonian Chronicle, interestingly, preserves no mention of garrisons installed by Nebuchadnezzar. On the other hand, the Chron



Babylonian Strategies of Imperial Control in the West 245
icle does note that Nebuchadnezzar captured the region of Hamath and dislodged the Egyptians from it in Nabopolassar’s 20th year (605). Biblical narratives also state that Pharaoh Necho earlier had a presence at rblh barß  ̇mt ‘Riblah in the land of Hamath’ (2 Kgs 23:33); Riblah was a town at the northern end of the Beka Valley on the east bank of the Orontes. Necho brought Jehoahaz of Judah there for judgment after he rebelled. Nebuchadnezzar, after ousting the Egyptians, used Riblah as a Babylonian outpost (2 Kgs 25:6, 20, 21)—part of his strategy to eliminate Egyptian influence in the Levant (2 Kgs 24:7). He summoned Judean rebels there to answer for their recalcitrance. Riblah, however, had been part of the Neo-Assyrian province of Íubat. The fact that Judean historians contemporary with Nebuchadnezzar identify the city as rblh barß  ̇mt rather than rblh barß ßbh or even  ̇mt-ßbh (2 Chr 8:3–4) may suggest that the Neo-Assyrian organization had dissolved and the region came to be designated again by its main urban center. Naaaman proposed a different solution: that Hamath and Íubat were merged into one Assyrian province, which was the basis for the designation Hamath-Zobah in 2 Chr 8:3–4 (Naaaman 1999: 424–25).8 His evidence, however, is too indirect to decide the matter, and the references to Hamath alone in the biblical and Babylonian texts speak against the persistence of such a composite entity. In addition to Riblah, we hear that Chaldeans were present in Mizpah with Gedaliah after 586 and may have been organized as a small garrison (2 Kgs 25:25), small enough to be overwhelmed by a minimal Judean force, if the biblical narrative should be accepted at face value. The installation of Babylonian garrisons in these instances, with the exception of Riblah, was not a particularly robust strategy, because three of the four were reduced after a year or less. Such garrisons, in any case, hardly represented the levers of imperial administration in the Levant. Two other indications from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar do suggest that pihatu-officials, ‘governors’, were present in Syria: one is the geographical summation in Nebuchadnezzar’s Etemenanki inscription, which lists regions obliged to contribute to the construction of Marduk’s ziqqurat in Babylon. This summation mentions kings in Ebir Nari, but also pihatu and sakkanakku officials in Hatti who were obligated to contribute to Babylonian construction enterprises (Wetzel and Weissbach 1938: 46 4.11–25). Two administrative tablets from Sippar

also indicate that Arpad possessed a pihatu official in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar.9 The texts do not preserve his name and thus do not indicate whether he was a Babylonian official. Arpad was the capital of the Assyrian province of Bit-Agusi and remained an important center in the region. These cases may therefore indicate a greater Babylonian involvement in the Upper Euphrates region than elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean. Other evidence is lacking, in any case, to show that Nebuchadnezzar installed any Babylonian officials in the Southern Levant, although some scholars have argued that he did. Eckhard Unger, for example, argued that Nebuchadnezzar installed a sandabakku-official in Phoenician Tyre (Unger 1926; followed by Katzenstein 1993: 332–33; Wiseman 1991: 235; Elat 1991: 32–33). His evidence was a group of eleven Neo-Babylonian tablets written at a city called Íurru between the 31st and 42d regnal years of Nebuchadnezzar (see now Joannès 1987: 147–48). The sandabakku, Enlil-sapik-zeri, is the first witness to a transaction described in one of the tablets. Landsberger, however, already suggested that there was probably a small site named Íurru near Uruk and that these tablets do not refer to Phoenician Tyre (Landsberger 1933: 298). Joannès has conclusively proved that the toponym Íurru should be located between Nippur and Uruk and that the sandabakku was resident in Nippur, the usual seat of that official (Joannès 1982: 39–40; 1987: 149; Vanderhooft 1999: 100 n. 159). Settlements near Nippur during the Neo-Babylonian period were often named after the ethnicon or place of origin of the deportees who populated them (Ephoal 1978; Zadok 1978; Joannès and Lemaire 1999), and Íurru may have been linked to Phoenician Tyre in the same way. Another text written at Íurru in the fortieth year of Nebuchadnezzar (564 b.c.e.) mentions one mmil-ki-i-†i-ri lúen.nam (bel pihati) sá uruki-di-is ‘Milki-eteri, governor of (the city of) Kidis’.10 A few scholars understood this as a reference to Qadesh on the Orontes River in Syria, which would place a Babylonian administrator in the region south of Arpad and immediately north of Riblah (Unger 1926: 316–17; McEwan 1982: 5 n. 5; Wiseman 1985: 28; 1991: 235; Zadok 1985: 255, s.v. Qidis; Elat 1991: 33; Naaaman 1999: 425). Again, however, it is probable that Kidis, like Íurru, was a settlement near Nippur (so also Joannès 1982:
9. Nbk 74:3’–4’ (15.Ayaru.19) has lúNAM sá uruar-pa-da; CT 56, 439:13 (17.Ayaru.19 Nbk) mentions [lúe]n.nam sá uruar-pa-du; the texts were reedited by Joannès (1994). 10. The text (BM 81-4-28, 88) was first published by Pinches and later discussed by Unger (1926: 316–17). It was reedited by Joannès (1982: 37), from which source it is cited here.

42 n. 1). In fact, the scribe of the text in question wrote it in Íurru. In another tablet written at Kidis, we read of a slave transaction in which the slave is delivered to the buyer’s father, who lives in Nippur (McEwan 1982: no. 2, obv. 8–9). This certainly suggests that Kidi s was near Nippur, not in northwestern Syria.11 Thus, “Milki-eteri, governor of Kidis” was not a Babylonian imperial official in the Levant; he was a local official in southern Babylonia. Recently, Dandamayev has argued that a group of five Neo-Babylonian tablets from the reign of Nabonidus points to the earlier establishment of a Neo-Babylonian “colony” on the Upper Euphrates (1999). These tablets were composed in 549 and 548 at a place called uruelammu (written urunim-mu, the same writing used for the country of Elam). Dandamayev suggested that uruelam-mu should be identified with uruE-lam-mu, just south of Carchemish; according to the Babylonian Chronicle, Nabopolassar captured the town in 606 (Grayson 1975: 98 21). Dandamayev proposed that a Babylonian “colony” may have settled in the town. It is also possible, however, that Elammu was a settlement in the vicinity of Uruk, named either for Elamite deportees or for the Syrian city. As Dandamayev himself noted, a witness in one of the texts, Innina-ahhe-iddin, son of Nabû-bun-su†ur, descendant of Hunzu, also appears in a document from Uruk dated to 536 (Dandamayev 1999: 544 and n. 18). Even if Dandamayev is correct about the Syrian origin of these tablets, it remains unclear whether the presence of such a “colony” of Babylonians on the Upper Euphrates should lead us to reconstruct a systematic Babylonian administrative system there, let alone elsewhere in the Levant. Another contrast between Assyrian and Babylonian procedures in the West should be highlighted in the context of this discussion: deportation. As has long been recognized, the Assyrian policy of crossdeportation, transferring foreign populations into recently conquered territories, was not followed by the Babylonians. The Babylonians settled deported groups in Babylonia but apparently did not transplant others into the conquered zones. This difference is best explained as a consequence of the Babylonian failure to install or promote an imperial provincial administration outside of Babylonia (Vanderhooft 1999: 110–12 with literature; on Babylonian practices, see most recently Joannès and Lemaire 1999: 24–27).
11. Whether the settlement at Kidis was named for deportees from Syrian Qadesh is uncertain but possible.



248 David Vanderhooft
On balance, therefore, the historian lacks strong evidence to argue for a ramified Babylonian bureaucracy in the southern Levant. The Babylonian mechanisms of control there centered on the extraction of tribute (biltu) from subjugated or client kings of local polities, and a conscious effort to prevent Egyptian encroachment.
The Rhetoric of Empire: Some Examples
How may we characterize the rhetoric of imperialism under Nebuchadnezzar? The Babylonian royal inscriptions hold out less hope than the Assyrian inscriptions do for reconstructing what Liverani termed the “grammar” of imperialism. This is because of the form and content of the royal inscriptions: in terms of form, they self-consciously mimic a model developed already in Sumerian royal inscriptions; and in terms of content, they do not much occupy themselves with the relationship of the king to the non-Babylonian world (for an overview, see Berger 1973). Nevertheless, a quick survey of Nebuchadnezzar’s inscriptions suggests that he struggled, like his father, Nabopolassar, to distance himself from the rhetoric of the Neo-Assyrian kings. Instead, as many scholars have recognized, Nebuchadnezzar projected an image of himself as a king in the mold of Sargon of Akkad and Hammurapi of Babylon (Berger 1973: 92–95; Vanderhooft 1999: 50–51). The royal titles and epithets adopted by Nebuchadnezzar allow a glimpse into the imperial self-consciousness of the king. Nebuchadnezzar’s scribes, it would appear, made a deliberate effort to appeal to an archaic titulary. The use of archaic titles is not unusual for royal inscriptions, but it is also not random. Following Berger, among others, I have argued that together with a special interest in titles that originated with Hammurapi in the Old Babylonian period, the titulary illuminates specific ways in which the scribes portrayed Nebuchadnezzar as the bearer of an ancient Babylonian royal tradition. A number of royal epithets that appeared first in the inscriptions of Hammurapi appear subsequently only in inscriptions of Babylonian kings. A few examples include asru ‘humble’ (Seux 1967: 366); babil igisê rabûtim ana X ‘who brings expensive gifts to X (= temples and gods, or both)’ (p. 46);12
12. Hammurapi uses only babil hegallim ana Ekisnugal ‘who brings abundance to Ekisnugal’, but the parallel to the Neo-Babylonian phrase is exact; and this use of the active participle babilu in the titulary is shared only by Hammurapi and the Neo-Babylonian kings.

emqu ‘wise’ (p. 82);13 etel sarri ‘prince of kings’ (p. 91); mugarrini karê bitrûtim ‘who stores barley in immense piles’ (only Hammurapi and Nebuchadnezzar II, p. 96); mustalu ‘judicious one’ (p. 171);14 mustemiqu ‘suppliant’ (only Hammurapi and Nebuchadnezzar II, p. 171); and qarrad qarradi ‘hero of heroes’ (only Hammurapi and Nabopolassar, p. 231). There is a self-consciously Babylonian character to the titulary of the Neo-Babylonian kings (for a fuller discussion, see Vanderhooft 1999: 16–23). I have also argued that an important contrast exists between the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian titularies. Seux already suggested in his study of royal epithets that the Neo-Assyrian titulary is based on a group of five common epithets; these are: sar mat Assur ‘king of the land of Assyria’, sarru rabû ‘great king’, sarru dannu ‘mighty king’, sar kissati ‘king of the universe’, and sar kibrat erbetti ‘king of the four corners’ (Seux 1967: 13 n. 2). Despite the venerable status of these epithets and the appearance of some of them even in the inscriptions of Hammurapi, the Neo-Babylonian kings avoid them almost entirely in their royal inscriptions, as Tadmor also recently noted (1998: 356). There is, however, a conspicuous exception: Nabonidus employs all four in his inscription dedicated to the rebuilding of the Ehulhul temple in Harran, an inscription that a number of scholars have shown appeals to literary models of Assurbanipal (Gadd 1958; Tadmor 1965: 353; Berger 1973: 96; Beaulieu 1989: 143, 214). I would hypothesize that the avoidance of these epithets in the royal inscriptions of Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar should be related to their effort to distance themselves from their Neo-Assyrian forebears who had recently claimed the kingship of Babylonia, and who had based their militaristic and expansionist agenda, in part at least, on precisely these epithets. Nabonidus, by contrast, knew no such reticence. The titularies of Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, in fact, contain few royal epithets that refer to ruling the world. A few other observations about the royal inscriptions reinforce this idea that the Babylonian scribes sought to express the king’s role in terms different from those used by the Assyrian kings, including those
13. Rubû emqu ‘wise prince’ is also a characteristically Neo-Babylonian title (Seux 1967: 252). It is used twice by Esarhaddon but in nearly identical inscriptions—one intended for Nippur and the other for Uruk (Borger 1956: 70 §39; 74 §47: 24). 14. It is also used as an adj. in the NB titulary: reaum mustalu ‘judicious shepherd’ (Seux 1967: 246); and rubû mustalu ‘judicious prince’ (p. 253).

who ruled Babylonia and composed inscriptions there. Thus, for example, Nabû grants the king a ha††u isartu ‘just scepter’, ana sutesur kal dadme u summuhu tenesetim ‘to lead all the inhabited regions aright and to make humanity thrive’ (Langdon 1912: 112 i 16–17; 122 i 44; 102 iii 11). On other occasions Nebuchadnezzar’s inscriptions call the royal emblem sibirru musallim nisi ‘the scepter for keeping the people well’ (Langdon 1912: 140 i 9; 150 A ii 1; 102 iii 13). This consistently benign presentation of the scepter in his texts contrasts with the Assyrian royal inscriptions of the first millennium, where the sibirru is often a weapon of terror granted by Assur for crushing foes and expanding the realm (e.g., Borger 1956: 98 32; Machinist 1993: 95). The Assyrian king, furthermore, vowed at his investiture to extend the realm of Assur. The Neo-Babylonian image of the royal scepter is benign, in the royal rhetoric at least. Even the idea of deportation, for example, which is explicitly referred to in the Assyrian inscriptions in connection with the sibirru, is only hinted at in Nebuchadnezzar’s inscriptions. This conforms with the common assertion in Nebuchadnezzar’s inscriptions that he causes people everywhere to thrive (summuhu). Marduk placed the people of the entire world under his care, a very common Mesopotamian concept. But Nebuchadnezzar, as the good shepherd, “directs them in the proper path and the correct way of life,” a line borrowed from his Old Babylonian mentor, Hammurapi (Vanderhooft 1999: 41–43). Such contrasts between the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions cannot be explained solely on the basis of the Babylonian abhorrence of Assyria. It also has to do with native developments in the royal inscription genre. But in the few cases in the titulary that I have described, in the general reticence of the Babylonian royal inscriptions to trumpet an explicit militarism, and in the later evidence from the reign of Nabonidus where he appeals to textual models furnished by Assurbanipal and the Sargonid kings of Assyria, I think it is legitimate to hypothesize that there was a deliberate rhetorical contrast. This rhetorical distinction may have been exacerbated by the bitter war for Babylonian independence during the reign of Nabopolassar. Regardless, I would argue that Babylonian administrative mechanics in the Levant, or lack thereof, likewise do not reflect Assyrian methods and tactics. It is, therefore, a mistake to consider Nebuchadnezzar the heir of Assyrian imperial practices or rhetoric. This conclusion, tentative though it may be, finds support in the historiography of the kingdoms subjugated by Nebuchadnezzar in the Levant, particularly Judah.



Babylonian Strategies of Imperial Control in the West 251
Judahite Historiography
How may we begin to assess the consequences of Nebuchadnezzar’s administrative and rhetorical achievements for Judahite historiographical traditions? A variety of responses to Babylonian subjugation appear in the Hebrew Bible (Vanderhooft 1999). The texts give voice, for example, to the ubiquitous Near Eastern view that associates subjugation by a foreign enemy with displeasure of the patron deity—in the case of Judah, Yhwh. According to this pattern, Nebuchadnezzar is “the servant of Yhwh,” to use Jeremiah’s language (e.g., Jer 27:6), who fulfills God’s purpose for punishing Israel. Such typological responses had already been recorded in connection with the earlier depredations of the NeoAssyrian kings (Machinist 1983). What is more interesting for the present discussion is that certain fundamental historiographical concepts originate in reflection upon the decisive actions and associated imperial rhetoric of Nebuchadnezzar, who, in biblical usage, came to be known simply as melek babel ‘the king of Babylon’. The historiographical presentation of Judah’s last decade according to biblical texts focuses on the termination of the kingdom’s institutional structures. In 2 Kings 24–25, Jeremiah 39 and 52, and 2 Chronicles, the biblical writers present a fairly detailed catalogue of the actions taken by Nebuchadnezzar and his field commander, Nabuzaradan, during the first and second assaults on Jerusalem. The element of first importance in these descriptions is the fate of the king, together with his court and associated elites; second is concern with Temple paraphernalia, the kelîm, and the palace treasury; third is the physical integrity of Jerusalem, its structures and defenses. None of this is surprising, since we expect a conqueror to be preoccupied with precisely these aspects of Judah’s institutional life, and their removal or compromise would of course represent a psychological trauma. What is more interesting in terms of the Babylonian influence on Judahite historiography is the Judean treatment of the following era (see the trenchant essay by S. Japhet in this volume, pp. 75–89). An epilogue appears in 2 Kings concerning the abortive rule and assassination of the Judean nobleman Gedaliah ben A ̇ikam (2 Kgs 25:22–26), followed by a terse notice that the Babylonian king Evil-Merodach (Amel-Marduk) released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison in Babylon and provided him with a state pension (25:27–30; Weidner 1939). Apart from these episodes, Kings, Chronicles, Jeremiah, Lamentations, and Ezekiel all paint, with slightly different palettes, the same

252 David Vanderhooft
portrait of the period after Nebuchadnezzar’s assaults: that of an empty landscape. A number of scholars have asserted recently that modern historians have uncritically accepted this “Myth of the Empty Land”—and perhaps the whole concept of a Babylonian Exile (Barstad 1996; Grabbe 1998; for the contrary view, see Smith-Christopher 1997). They charge that modern scholars present in historical costume an ideal biblical projection, a projection designed to legitimate later communities who were to claim the land as their rightful patrimony. Biblical scholars such as Barstad and archaeologists such as Finkelstein have recently argued that the land of Judah was not a tabula rasa in the Babylonian period (Barstad 1996; Finkelstein and Silberman 2000: 305–8; also Graham 1984). For them, the biblical portrait is a fabrication. Finkelstein has suggested that the majority of the population, perhaps 75 percent, remained after the Babylonian campaigns; Barstad concludes that life would have gone on more or less as usual. This entire argument, interestingly, bears a remarkable resemblance, as Barstad himself recognized, to a similar one developed earlier in the twentieth century. C. C. Torrey argued that there never was a captivity, and as a result there could not have been a restoration of Judeans to Palestine in the Persian era (Barstad 1996: 21–23). The biblical writers, especially the Chronicler, fabricated this presentation to disenfranchise members of the community and facilitate the purportedly xenophobic programs of Ezra and Nehemiah. W. F. Albright responded to Torrey’s views as follows: “they are as totally devoid of historical foundation as they are of respect for ancient oriental records” (Albright 1957: 246). The reconstruction of the revisionists, from Torrey to more-recent (if less-extreme) exponents, is unpersuasive. It fails to persuade in part because of an inaccurate assessment of Babylonian imperial procedures and attendant reconstructions of Judahite and Levantine history in the mid–sixth century. The reconstruction fails, just as importantly, because it improperly impugns the historiographical work of the biblical writers. The revisionists recognize, rightly, that some of the biblical writers had an agenda: to legitimate the community and institutions of the later Persian period by asserting their fundamental continuity with the period before the Babylonian conquest. The revisionists conclude, wrongly, that because some biblical writers had an agenda, their historiographical reconstruction must be false and that instead of disruption there must have been significant continuity between the era of the monarchy and the Persian period.

Babylonian Strategies of Imperial Control in the West 253
The archaeological evidence does not favor an argument for continuity. Ephraim Stern has argued that in the wake of the Babylonian conquests in the Levant the archaeological record exhibits a “gap” at a large majority of sites until the Achaemenid era (Stern 2001). I have made a similar argument, and I think it remains the best interpretation of the evidence (Vanderhooft 1999: 83–86; 104–10). Here I will not offer a detailed discussion, which can be had in other essays in the present volume, but will only outline my position.15 The evidence pertaining to the Babylonian period may be contrasted with that from the Assyrian imperial rule of the southern Levant. The following types of material appear in the Assyrian period: imported Assyrian pottery and local imitations, Assyrian architecture, cuneiform tablets, monumental inscriptions, glyptic art, and explicit evidence for provincialization and installation of Assyrian administrators at many places in the southern Levant. By contrast, very little explicitly Babylonian material culture appears in the Levant in the sixth century (details in Vanderhooft 1999; Stern 2001). Neo-Babylonian stamp seals, despite their ubiquity elsewhere, are exceedingly rare;16 there are no examples of Neo-Babylonian architecture; while only one cuneiform inscription fragment is known that might date to the period, and, significantly, it is not an administrative text but is, rather, some kind of dedicatory item (McCown 1947: 150–53 and pl. 55:80).17 Meanwhile, Babylonian conquests in the southern Levant are attested in many sealed destruction
15. See the essays in the present volume by C. Carter (301–322) and O. Lipschits (323–376). See also Carter 1999; Lipschits 1998; 1999; Milevski 1996–97; Stager 1996; Stern 2001; and Zorn 1997. I have sketched an outline similar to the one here in Vanderhooft forthcoming. 16. In his catalogue, E. Stern could point to only one Neo-Babylonian seal, from Eingedi, and it is from a late-sixth-century context (Stern 1982: 197). Such Neo-Babylonian seals, furthermore, continue to appear in Persian contexts elsewhere, which makes them unreliable indicators of Neo-Babylonian imperial presence in any case. 17. Zorn hypothesized in his Tel Aviv lecture on Tell en-Naßbeh that the piece probably does reflect Babylonian presence and practices in the former kingdom of Judah. After discussions with Zorn and after renewed efforts to read the text with Wayne Horowitz of Hebrew University, I would maintain the view that the text cannot with certainty be connected to the putative Babylonian administration in Judah. Neither its stratigraphic context (cistern no. 166, dated broadly to the seventh century; McCown 1947: 153) nor its palaeography (definitely Neo-Babylonian, but datable almost anywhere in the first half of the first millennium; A. Sachs in McCown 1947: 152) provides a secure date in the mid–sixth century. It might have arrived at Naßbeh in Babylonian hands after the conquest of Jerusalem, but it is impossible to rule out either an earlier or a later arrival. For a full discussion, see Horowitz and Vanderhooft 2002.

layers securely dated before the import of Attic ceramics, which begin to arrive in the Levant in the second half of the sixth century (Stern 1982: 136–41; Boardman 1999: 46–54; Waldbaum and Magness 1997). Absent Greek imports, whose dates can be calibrated fairly closely, or a ceramic chronology from secure stratigraphic loci, archaeologists, it seems, are reduced to speculation about what pottery forms might belong to the post-destruction Babylonian period. The most hopeful evaluations suggest that Tell el-Fûl (Gibeah) phase IIIB dates to the period between 586 and 538 (Lapp 1981: 84101);18 if so, it might provide a fixed reference point in the ceramic chronology. The case, however, remains somewhat problematic. In the final publication, it was argued that a “homogenous group” of ceramic types from Tell el-Fûl should be dated to the exilic period. Some of the pottery included in this group, however, comes from mixed loci at Tell el-Fûl, such as the Mid-Field silos. More problematic is the fact that comparative forms adduced come from Late Iron II or Persian period strata at other sites, or from tombs (Beth-shemesh, Lachish), mixed Iron II–Persian groups, or sites without reliable stratigraphy (Bethel). Thus, while the absence of a site-wide destruction at Tell el-Fûl suggests that it continued to be occupied through the sixth century, the pottery assigned by N. Lapp specifically to the “exilic” period cannot be confined to that period: there are parallels either with Late Iron Age II or early Persian forms at other sites. Meanwhile, the stratigraphy of stratum II at Tell en-Naßbeh, Mizpah, where biblical texts report that Gedaliah made his abortive effort to rule, resists easy analysis. Recent attempts by J. Zorn to clarify the site’s settlement history show that it did not undergo a massive destruction in the sixth century (1997; Lipschits 1999). Zorn has hypothesized that the site was deliberately abandoned, partially leveled (at the end of stratum III), and then partially rebuilt to serve as a Babylonian administrative center (at the beginning of stratum II). However the case is eventually decided, the site was not originally excavated in such a way as to permit recovery of a secure ceramic typology for the mid–sixth century. At present, therefore, archaeologists have not been
18. Prof. Joseph Blenkinsopp protested that too many archaeologists have sought to link the destruction of Judean sites to particular historical moments on the basis of biblical data (for example, B. Mazar’s dating of the destruction at Ein-gedi to 582). In fairness, we must be skeptical of the same efforts when linked to arguments that favor continuity between the Babylonian and Persian periods. The published report of the excavations at Tell el-Fûl, for example, cannot have arrived at the dates for phase IIIB (586538 b.c.e.) by a happy coincidence (Lapp 1981: xvii).



Babylonian Strategies of Imperial Control in the West 255
able to refine the ceramic chronology of the Late Iron II precisely enough to identify “Babylonian” or “exilic” period strata at sites in the southern Levant.19 Without such a typological sequence, and given the meager evidence for Babylonian presence in the region, it will be difficult to sustain the idea that the Babylonians promoted a provincial administration designed to exploit the former kingdom of Judah. In fact, the opposite of exploitation seems to have happened: the Babylonian destructions disrupted patterns of trade and economic prosperity throughout the Levant; resulting, notably, in the cessation of east Greek imports into the southern Levantine corridor, and a shift of such imports into the Nile Delta, particularly at Daphnae and Naucratis, but also Migdol (Vanderhooft 1999: 83–87; Stern 2001). Nebuchadnezzar’s conquests could hardly have served as the basis for colonization or economic exploitation of conquered kingdoms, let alone for their development as provincial units. Judah, as Lipschits and others have shown, was certainly not completely depopulated during the Babylonian era—something, incidentally, that Albright explicitly acknowledged for the Negev and Benjamin regions (1957: 247) and that others, such as Martin Noth (1963: 267), emphasized. To argue, however, that there was some degree of demographic continuity through the sixth century is not the same thing as arguing that the Babylonians installed a provincial government in Judah or that they had a coherent bureaucratic policy in the Levant. Meanwhile, biblical texts often refer to a shift in the locus of Judah’s elite after the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and deported elements of the population (e.g., 2 Kgs 24:12, 15–16; 25:7, 11; Ezek 1:1; 8:1; Jer 52:28; Psalm 137). This corresponds too with what we know of Babylonian procedures for deporting conquered elites: as mentioned above, the Babylonians did not repopulate conquered zones with settlers from elsewhere but, rather, settled groups of deportees in Babylonia according to their place of origin or ethnicity. Admittedly, reconstruction of the condition of Judahite deportees in Babylonia in the sixth century remains a hazardous enterprise because of sparse data. Even here, however, new information continues to appear, most notably the cuneiform tablets from Babylonian settlements, including al Yahudu ‘the city of Judah’, some of which were published by Joannès and Lemaire (1999;
19. That there was a disjunction in the southern Levant associated with the transition from the Iron Age II to the Persian period is not in question. For analysis of the corresponding ceramic caesura in the northern Levant in the first decades of the sixth century, see Lehmann 1998: 7–37.

Vanderhooft forthcoming).20 The presence of high percentages of Hebrew names in these texts suggests that the biblical insistence on the shift of the elite into Babylonia was not mere fancy. Overall, the archaeological and demographic data coupled with the anecdotal evidence concerning Jewish scribes and functionaries in the early Persian period (Vanderhooft forthcoming) conform quite well in outline with the historiographical reconstruction of the sixth century offered in biblical texts. The Judean historiographers reconstruct the era of the mid–sixth century in Palestine as one characterized by sharp, if not total, demographic decline; as one in which a significant part of the Judean elite was relocated to Mesopotamia; and as one devoid of any effective administrative apparatus, local or imperial. From what we can learn of Babylonian imperial practices and the rhetoric that informed them, such a reconstruction was won through close observation. Some biblical writers of the Persian era may have seized the opportunity to emphasize the emptiness of Judah in this period to further their agenda of connecting the institutions in the Persian period with their forerunners from the time of the monarchy. But evidence for the existence of such an agenda does not prove that the writers fabricated their reconstruction of the Babylonian era out of whole cloth. This is where the revisionists err. The modern historian is better served to ask why the biblical writers offer the reconstruction that they do. In the case of their reconstruction of the period after the fall of the kingdom, the answer depends more on an understanding of the actions of Nebuchadnezzar described above than on any proposal about the biblical authors’ efforts to fashion an image of the Jewish ethnos in a later period.
20. L. E. Pearce will soon publish additional Neo-Babylonian tablets of this type, which, she has kindly informed me, contain a significant number of West Semitic names.

The Fall of Nineveh and the Rise to Power of the Neo-Babylonian Kingdom
In the late seventh century b.c.e., Neo-Babylonian military forces successfully defeated their Neo-Assyrian rivals, establishing Babylon’s hegemony over all the Near East. Although the Assyrians might have struck a “deal” with Babylon, the Medes carried the day, invading Assyria and capturing all three of its major centers by the end of 612 b.c.e., including Assur, the religious capital, Nineveh, the administrative center, and Nimrud, the military headquarters (Roux 1992: 37576). The last Assyrian resistance was suppressed by the Medes and the Babylonians in 609 b.c.e., when Harran fell along with the few Egyptian troops who had been sent to assist Egypt’s “Assyrian allies” (Roux 1992: 376; Oates 1986: 127–28; Tadmor 1999: 188–89).1 While the Medes apparently stationed troops in Harran as a possible staging area for action in Asia Minor, the Babylonians were left in complete control of Mesopotamia. As George Roux puts it, Assyria had “been wiped off the map” (Roux 1992: 377; Langdon 1912: 61; Borger 1959: 62–76).2 The Babylonians turned all their attention to a revival of the strength and religious standing of southern Mesopotamia and the subjugation of Syria–Palestine to the West. In 609 b.c.e., in an effort to
1. The Assyrian king, Sin-sarra-iskun, is said to have died in the burning of Nineveh. The Assyrians seem to have had no idea that their kingdom was in such dire straits. Hayim Tadmor argued recently that the office of the Chief Eunuch in Assyria had become so strong as to seize the imperial throne just before Nabopolassar’s accession. 2. Nabopolassar wrote Assyria’s epitaph: “I slaughtered the land of Subarum (Assyria), I turned the hostile land into heaps and ruins. The Assyrian, who since distant days had ruled over all the peoples, and with his heavy yoke had brought injury to the people of the Land, his feet from Akkad I turned back, his yoke I threw off” (Langdon 1912: 61).

assist the Assyrians, Pharoah Necho II invaded Judah en route to the north. In battle near Megiddo, King Josiah of Judah was killed in a useless, foolish effort to stop the Egyptians (see 2 Kgs 23:29; 2 Chr 35:20; Jer 14:2; Herodotus 2.159; Roux 1992: 377; Duncan and Opatowski 1992: 21).3 If we examine Babylonian foreign policy at this juncture, we may assume that the leadership was willing to cede the northern mountainous regions to the Medes. However, Egyptian control of Phoenicia and Judah was totally unacceptable. Necho II put Jehoiakim on the throne in Jerusalem, believing him loyal to his person. But the Babylonians had to do something to open up their trade routes to the west into the Mediterranean basin. Babylonian prosperity depended on open trade with the west. Nabopolassar, who was now aging, came to rely more and more on his son, Nabu-kudurri-ußur (‘Nebuchadnezzar’) to conduct the necessary military operations (Roux 1992: 378). In a lightning attack against Carchemish, Nebuchadnezzar defeated the Egyptian garrison, which had been reinforced by Greek mercenaries. The fighting was pitched and difficult, but Carchemish fell, and all its remaining defenders were killed. A part of the Egyptian force escaped to the south toward Hama, where a Babylonian force caught up with them and “defeated them so that not a single man escaped to his own country” (Oates 1986: 128; Wiseman 1961: 59–61; Saggs 1973: 166; Starr 1991: 138–39). This victory had an immediate “impact on sensitive opinion in the west.” Jeremiah foresaw that Babylon would take control over the entire western region (25:1–14; 46:112). Nebuchadnezzar pushed his advantage, turning toward Egypt, only to learn of Nabopolasssar’s death. Fearing a possible coup d’etat, he returned to Babylon “in twenty-three days”—a remarkably fast journey—and was crowned king in his father’s stead in September, 605 b.c.e. (Roux 1992: 378; Wiseman 1983: 14–15). Although Babylon wished that Syria, Phoenicia, and Judah would simply pay their tribute as they had to Assyria, these small city-states and kingdoms had different ideas. Also the Egyptians were not through with their dream of reestablishing a Syrian or Canaanite province as had once been the norm under Thutmosis III. Nebuchadnezzar had little choice but to campaign in the Levant annually to impress the local authorities with his resolve and power. In 604, he collected tribute from Damascus, Tyre, Sidon, and Jehoiakim’s Jerusa

lem. He also destroyed Ashqelon, whose ruler had revolted. Evidence of this massive destruction has recently been uncovered in renewed excavations of the city. Judah, under Jehoiakim, became a vassal state of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, according to 2 Kgs 24:1.
The Neo-Babylonian Destruction of Judah and Jerusalem
The Babylonian Chronicles describe a great battle in 601, when Nebuchadnezzar attacked the king of Egypt, with the two rulers “inflicting great havoc on each other” (Roux 1992: 378–79; Oates 1986: 128). When the Babylonian forces retired to refit and regroup, Jehoiakim may have seen an opportunity to assert himself, rebelling and refusing to pay more tribute to Babylon. In 598 b.c.e., Nebuchadnezzar was back, arrayed against Judah and Jerusalem with the help of vassal forces from Syria, Moab, and Ammon—all under the command of the Babylonian king. From the perspective of Jeremiah and the Deuteronomistic historian, the sins of Manasseh were weighing heavily upon Judah and the nation’s only course of action was to submit to Babylonian control (Bright 1981: 326–27; Wiseman 1983: 31–32). Jehoiakim, who owed his throne to the Egyptian pharoah, was in the middle of a great Near Eastern power struggle. Apparently he sensed that the balance of power was shifting once again toward the Egyptians, so he defied the Babylonians, withholding tribute. This provoked Nebuchadnezzar, who marched on Jerusalem in the winter of 598/597 b.c.e. (Duncan and Opatowski 1998: 22; Stern 2000: 48). Jehoiakim died suddenly and his 18-year-old son, Jehoiachin, took his place on the throne. He ascended to power in Jerusalem in the middle of a crisis, with an enemy army bearing down on his capital city, intent on reasserting their hegemony. According to the biblical account, Jehoiachin surrendered to the Babylonians, along with his mother, his court, all his officials, and his eunuchs. All were made prisoners of the Babylonian army and deported to Babylon, along with about 3,000 Judeans and men of Jerusalem. The account in 2 Kings 24 mentions specifically “people of substance,” “craftsmen and smiths, all of them able-bodied men and skilled armourers.” Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, was made king and his name changed to Zedekiah. Some of the deportees, like the prophet Ezekiel, were settled in the region of Nippur (Oates 1986: 128–29). If we are to believe the account in 2 Kings, Zedekiah must have been in collusion with the Egyptians even before Nebuchadnezzar anointed him to be the new king over Jerusalem and Judah. Although he swore



266 John W. Betlyon
a loyalty oath to the Babylonian king, he openly rebelled against Babylon in 589 b.c.e., siding with the Egyptians. Necho II’s successor, Psammetichus II, had marched his armies into Syria in approximately 600 b.c.e. The Egyptian army’s presence may have bolstered Zedekiah’s belief that Egyptian arms would be victorious. But once more Babylonian forces surrounded Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar directed operations from his headquarters at Riblah, near Homs in Syria (Wiseman 1983: 34; Roux 1992: 379). Wiseman writes of the elaborate steps taken by Nebuchadnezzar to cut Jerusalem off from its supporting cities and towns and to bring up siege towers to make the breach in Jerusalem’s northern walls. The breakthrough happened in August, 587 b.c.e., and its Temple destroyed in 587/586 b.c.e. after an eighteen-month siege. Nebuchadnezzar captured Zedekiah as he fled toward Jericho, forcing him to watch as his sons were executed, before he himself was blinded (see 2 Kgs 25:6–7; 2 Chr 36:13–20; Jer 34:1–18). The people of the city who had not run toward Egypt were carried into exile and could only mourn the loss of Jerusalem and the Temple of God. They were in such dire straits that they may have been forced to surrender because of hunger (Jer 37:21; 2 Kgs 6:24–7:4). Ephraim Stern notes the pathos evident in the mournful tone of the book of Lamentations, grieving over the loss of the city that once was thronging with people. Now everything and everyone was gone; the sacred festivals were over, the pilgrims and priests gone; Jerusalem’s gates desolate (Lam 1:1–4; Stern 2000: 48; Wiseman 1983: 36–38). Excavations in and around Jerusalem in the past twenty years have unearthed evidence of this massive destruction by the Babylonian army (Cahill and Tyler 1994: 37–40). These excavations also demonstrate that the Babylonians made no effort to rebuild what they had destroyed. Apparently they feared a resurgent Jerusalem more than they believed that a restored city would benefit them economically and politically. There is little evidence of a Babylonian presence in Judah or Jerusalem in the following years, except for some occupation of Mizpah—Tell enNaßbeh—which became the provincial capital (Stern 2000: 46–47; 1994: 147).4 The Babylonians appear to have had their “hands full” with continuing problems in Egypt, resulting in a 568 b.c.e. campaign (approxi

At Tel Dor, for example, the population was predominantly Phoenician. Excavations have not revealed evidence of a Babylonian destruction, suggesting that the city simply surrendered rather than be destroyed.



Neo-Babylonian Military Operations Other than War 267
mately) that may have included fighting in the Nile Valley (Wiseman 1961: 30, 94–95). Indeed, Judean feelings for their new Babylonian overlords were made perfectly evident when Gedaliah—the Judean who had been appointed provincial governor by Babylon—was assassinated in about 580 b.c.e. This resulted in a third deployment to Judah by the Babylonian army and more punitive actions, which totally sapped the strength of the once-proud province. Nebuzaradan, the commander of the Babylonian Imperial Guard, took additional captives into exile, and Judah was annexed to the province of Samaria (Jer 52:30). Three times in less than twenty years, Judeans and the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile—in 596, 586, and 580 b.c.e.—probably totaling at least 20,000 deportees (Bright 1986: 344–46; Wiseman 1983: 38; Galling 1964: 51ff.). This last action would not have required a massive military force from Babylon. A small, highly trained, and motivated force of infantry could easily have completed this operation against a weakened opponent like Judah. Babylonian policy continued old objectives of mass deportation, which were also well documented in the Assyrian annals. Deportation was a punishment imposed on a population that, after recognizing Assyrian rule, rebelled against it. This is precisely the penalty imposed by the Neo-Babylonian rulers in the first quarter of the sixth century b.c.e. (Oded 1979: 41). The Babylonians learned this tactic from personal experience. Sennacherib, in order to subdue the rebellious people of the Babylonian homeland, dispersed parts of its population to various countries as a punishment for disloyalty to the Assyrian throne (1979: 41).5 Other Assyrian kings were known to have imposed the same penalty—including Ashurbanipal and Esarhaddon. Treaties established by the Neo-Assyrian kings with their subject peoples often included provision for deportation if a vassal king and his people broke covenant with Assyria. Indeed, the treaty between Ashur-Nerari V and Matiailu of Bit Agusi stated: “If Matiailu sins against (this) treaty . . . Matiailu together with his sons, daughters, officials, and the people of his land [will be ousted] from his country, will not return to his country, and not behold his country again” (Jer 22:10–13; Ezek 12:6, 12; Pritchard 1969: 532–33). This form of punishment, either for breaching a covenant or for some other misdeed, was not just an Assyrian practice. The Old Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, from as early as approximately 1750 b.c.e., included a similar warning for those who ignored its laws.
5. Asarhaddon, in a message to the king of Elam, threatened to deport him and many of the people of his principal cities.



268 John W. Betlyon
Certain texts from Egypt note that Egyptian and Hittite forces would deport rebellious subjects to far-off places as well (Oded 1979: 42; Pritchard 1969: 204, 530). So deportation was a serious punishment, inflicting sure calamity on individuals and governments, destroying homes and peoples’ livelihoods (Oded 1979: 43). Thus, Judah and Jerusalem fell in the first quarter of the sixth century b.c.e. These deportations strengthened Babylon’s resolve to dominate the region, eradicating rival powers that might have threatened Babylon’s existence. We would expect Babylonian forces to be firmly in control of Judah and Jerusalem, therefore, by approximately 580 b.c.e. With so many people deported, holding onto power in Judah should have been an easy affair. Charles Carter has demonstrated that the population at this time was substantially reduced from its pre-586 b.c.e. levels (Carter 1999: 195–205). The Babylonians, in their attacks against Judah, had also destroyed much of Philistia, including Ekron, Tel Batash, Tell Jemmeh, Ruqeish, and Tel Serao. The evidence from Ashqelon, cited by Lawrence Stager, substantiates that city’s devastation in approximately 604 b.c.e. (Stager 1996; Stern 2000: 46). Stern discusses these and other destructions throughout the country. From north to south, from Tel Dan to Tell elKheleifeh, and at major sites north and south—at Hazor, Megiddo, Dor, Ramat Ra ̇el, and Lachish—the major towns of the old Assyrian provinces and of Judah were totally destroyed (Mazar 1990: 458–61). At none of these sites was there evidence of any Babylonian or related military occupation. For about half a century, from 604 b.c.e. until 540 b.c.e., there is a “complete gap in evidence suggesting occupation. In all that time, not a single town destroyed by the Babylonians was resettled” (Stern 2000: 46–47; Weinberg 1969: 78–97). Even the Assyrian fortresses located along the Via Maris were left unoccupied—at least until the Persian period (Stern 1993; Wolff 1996: 744).
Neo-Babylonian Provincial Administration
Nebuchadnezzar appears to have been preoccupied with his own fear of a possible invasion by the Medes from the north. In an effort to resolve a threatening war between Cyaxares, the Mede, and Alyattes of Lydia, he negotiated a truce between the two armies and stationed forces of his own in Cilicia and several towns “along the border of Urartu” (Roux 1992: 380). This was the result of a famous battle that, according to Herodotus, had been interrupted by an eclipse (Herodotus 1.74). Nebuchadnezzar apparently died of an illness in October 562



Neo-Babylonian Military Operations Other than War 269
b.c.e. Little is known of his final years in power. His son, Amel-Marduk (called Evil-Merodach in the Hebrew Bible) ruled for just two years. Berossus claims that his rule was corrupt and lawless, with numerous plots against his life. He was killed by his brother-in-law Nerglissar, who had been a trusted adviser of Nebuchadnezzar (Berossus 3.10810; Sack 1978: 129–49). Apart from some repairs to several temples and a campaign in western Cilicia, Nerglissar ruled for only four years. His young son, Labashi-Marduk, succeeded him on the throne. The Babylonian annals suggest that this child-king exhibited such weakness and evil, that his friends plotted and tortured him to death only a few months later. The conspirators put one of their own on the throne, Nabu-naaid (‘Nabonidus’), in June 556 b.c.e. (Roux 1992: 381; Oates 1986: 131; Beaulieu 1989). A pattern of Babylonian “administration” had been established. It was a laissez-faire approach to provincial governance, at least as long as tribute was being paid. The nearly endless border incursions and rebellions appear to have been contained by this time, although the king had other pressing concerns. He was keenly aware of his nation’s religious traditions, excavating at the temenu of the temple of Marduk in Babylon and rebuilding it. He also focused on remodeling the temple of Sin in Harran, to which he had a significant family attraction (Beaulieu 1989: 205ff.; Roux 1992: 381–82). Nabonidus was devout, but politically and militarily uninterested and purportedly weak. Ancient sources depict him as an “aging antiquarian” who was more concerned with proper rituals and embellishments of the ancient shrines of Sumer and Akkad than with governing his kingdom.
The Rise of Persia and the Defeat of Babylon: Persia in the West
Cyrus II, “Great King, the Achaemenian, King of Parsumash and Anshan,” ascended the Persian throne in 559 b.c.e. Nabonidus, recalling previous occasions when Babylon had called on its eastern neighbors for military assistance, asked the Persians to join him in an attack on Harran to wrest it from control by the Medes. He desperately wanted to work on the temple of Sin. Cyrus apparently accepted this offer. A bitter war ensued between the Medes and the Persians resulting in the death of the Medes’ king, Astyages, in 550 b.c.e. Nabonidus had a dream in which the god Marduk told him that the Persians would expel the Medes from Harran; Marduk also ordered him to rebuild E.hul.hul, Sin’s great temple (Oates 1986: 132–33; Langdon 1912:



270 John W. Betlyon
221; Roux 1992: 383–84). Economic texts from Mesopotamia reveal that endless military campaigns and a lack of confidence in Nabonidus’s leadership led to exceedingly high rates of inflation. Between 560 and 550 b.c.e., prices allegedly rose by nearly 50% throughout the empire (Saggs 1962: 147–48, 261ff.). Cyrus thereupon embarked upon a series of successful campaigns intended to enlarge his kingdom. He turned to the west and attacked Lydia, occupying Cilicia in the process. Breaking his alliance with the Babylonians, he defeated Croesus at Pteryum in 547 b.c.e. Neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians were strong enough to come to the Lydians’ aid. One by one, the east Greek cities of Ionia and Asia Minior fell to Cyrus, who then turned to the east, absorbing Parthia, Aria, Sogdia, and Bactria (Roux 1992: 385). At the time, Nabonidus, who was very unpopular in Babylon, was campaigning in Arabia, subduing the oasis of Tema, which once had been an Assyrian stronghold. The New Year’s Festival usually celebrated in Babylon was cancelled for at least six years while the king was in Arabia, celebrating the festival there. Historians have no idea what Nabonidus was doing in Arabia for all this time. Perhaps Tema was at the intersection of several important trade routes; it may have also been a center for the cult of Sin (Oates 1986: 134; Roux 1992: 38586; Röllig 1964: 21–32; Lambert 1972: 53–64). Nabonidus may have been developing relationships with the Arab tribes to resist Cyrus’s western advances. For ten years he was absent from his seat of governmental power in Babylon. This caused a serious crisis in his capital (Oppenheim 1977: 152–53). The government had been left in his son’s hands, but Bel-sar-ußur (‘Belshazzar’) was not much of a politician and had difficulty managing affairs at home. Some have speculated that the references in Daniel (4:28–33) to the madness of Nebuchadnezzar are merely a textual corruption, instead referring to the madness of Nabonidus (Gadd 1958; von Soden 1935; Milik 1956; Henze 1999: 57–73; Sack 1991: 101–4).6 There was probably a pro-Persian party lobbying for submission to Cyrus. Cyrus’s victories over cities and city-states were always accompanied by efforts to gain the goodwill of the newly conquered peoples. Unlike his Babylonian predecessors, he chose not to frighten his subjects into obedience but to

pose as a liberator, treating prisoners with mercy and respecting local cults and customs (Beaulieu 1989: 232; Roux 1992: 386). One text from this period refers to Cyrus’s invasion of Babylon as the coming of a savior who restored traditional religion and freed Babylon from the oppression of Nabonidus. Cyrus’s attack came in the autumn of 539 b.c.e. The Nabonidus Chronicle clearly states that Babylon fell without a battle, and from the beginning the Babylonians were not offended in any way. An inscription describes the attack as one in which Marduk, offended by Nabonidus’s actions, marched alongside Cyrus to free Babylon (Grayson 1975: 109–10; Beaulieu 1989: 228–29). Every effort was made to restore conquered peoples to their homes and to enforce law and order throughout the country. Whatever the situation, Cyrus acted immediately to extend Persia’s borders to the west, launching forays into Egypt and throughout Asia Minor. Cambyses, who succeeded him, attempted to establish Persian hegemony in Egypt’s Nile Delta. Although he failed, Darius I succeeded soon thereafter. Archaeologically, the mid–sixth century is a difficult period in Judah and Israel because so much was destroyed. Babylonian destruction of the major harbor towns along the Palestinian coast also ended the previously intensive import of Greek ceramics into the country (Stern 2000: 51). How could the Babylonians expect to rule successfully over a vast kingdom when the economic infrastructures were in ruins? The Persians seem to have understood this problem because they immediately began the process of allowing exiled peoples to return home. The evidence from Persian Yehud suggests that few people actually returned, and those who did were faced with a daunting task of rebuilding. Yet at the same time, Persia engaged the Greeks in a lifeor-death battle for the Greek mainland, only to be turned away by a coalition of Athenians and Spartans at Marathon and, in the Aegean, at Salamis (Hammond 1986: chaps. 3–4). Persia’s focus turned to Egypt, which fought against the Persian invaders incessantly. Some provinces were quiet, such as Yehud, where the faithful remnant was returning from exile, and construction of a second Temple was completed in Jerusalem, in approximately 515 b.c.e. It appears that, at first, Persia followed the Babylonian practice of not stationing troops in conquered territories. However, when Darius I died, the great Egyptian revolt broke out, changing all of this. The revolt pitted Egyptians and their allies from the Delian league against Persian forces and their provincial allies. The war was hotly contested,

particularly in the Nile Delta, resulting in great loss of life. This campaign against Egypt and its allies necessitated the use and refurbishment of several old Judean logistical bases at sites such as Tell el-Hesi, Tell Jemmeh, and Tel Masos. Although initially they were sites built to help defend Judah and Lachish, Persia found a new use for them in the early fifth century b.c.e. Along with other fortresses at sites such as Hazor, Megiddo, Tell Qasile, and Tell el-Faroah (south), these sites were used to support troops involved in the massive campaign against Egypt during the revolt of the 460s (Betlyon forthcoming; 1991: 39–42; Stern 1984: 14; Hoglund 1992: 165–205; Stern 1982: 53–54). The sites in question were not usually fortified with large perimeter wall systems, but they had a fortress located near their center, or at least a fortified “watch tower.” Persian or Persian-related mercenary forces manned these installations. The fortresses were located along major highways and in the larger cities and towns of the region. It seems certain that Judah played a significant role in Assyria’s and Persia’s efforts to control the southern Levant and guard against Egyptian intervention in their affairs. From a military perspective, the substantial fortresses were probably used, abandoned, and then reused when needed. It seems clear that the biraniyot mentioned several times in the 1–2 Chronicles descriptions of Judean installations during the time of the monarchy are really Persian-period fortified buildings. The stratigraphic records bear out this change in dating. The biraniyot became the focus of Persia’s administration of the provinces, the Persians building a moreefficient, stronger presence in these regions than their Neo-Babylonian predecessors had done.
Persian Administration and Military Operations Other Than War
In a recent paper, I argued that Persian authorities adopted the use of “military operations other than war” (MOOTW) in their administration of Persian-period Yehud. Excavations at many sites have revealed buildings or fortified areas used in the early and/or late Persian periods (that is, ca. 540–450 and ca. 450–332 b.c.e., respectively). Tell en-Naßbeh, for example, was probably the Neo-Babylonian capital of the province. Jerusalem still remained in ruins, so the administrative center of the province was a large public building, building 74.01, which dates to the Late Iron II period and was used through the late sixth century b.c.e. (Carter 1999: 134–35; 1994: 106–45; Reich 1990: 16



Neo-Babylonian Military Operations Other than War 273
17; 1994: 111–18). Tell en-Naßbeh, biblical Mizpah, is a site that was part of the province’s administration when the Temple in Jerusalem was restored. Later, Jerusalem once again played a major role in provincial affairs, although it remained a small city with few people (see Carter’s [1999: 286–94] arguments for early Persian Yehud). The public building found at the site may well have been one of the biraniyot (the fortress/watch towers), which housed small detachments of troops. In this particular case, the soldiers kept watch over the northern approaches to Jerusalem and guarded Persian officials in the provincial “offices.” The Greek and east Greek ceramic forms found at the site closely parallel similar forms known from Tell el-Hesi and Tell Jemmeh, which were sites used for Persian military logistical operations in this period (Betlyon 1991: 39–41; Bennett and Blakely 1990: 134–37).7 Buildings in Óorvat Zimri (Nadelman 1993), the Ketef Hinnom in Jerusalem (Barkay 1994), Khirbet er-Ras (Carter 1999: 148–50), Ramat Ra ̇el (Aharoni 1962; 1964), Maoale Adummim (Carter 1999: 150–53), Beth-Zur (Reich 1992b: 113–23), Ein-gedi (Mazar and Dunayevsky 1967), Khirbet Abu et-Tuwein (Mazar 1982: 95–97; Hoglund 1992: 19395),8 and Khirbet Nijam (Dadon 1994: 87–88) typically have a central courtyard and are identifiable as “fortresses.” All of these sites are either close to Jerusalem or located on major roads leading up to the capital. We believe that troops—certainly not Judeans, but foreigners such as Greeks or eastern Greeks—were assigned to these “fortresses” as part of a “military operation other than war.” There is ample evidence to imagine Persian troops on a major military campaign, with thousands of infantry, cavalry, and support troops from all over the Empire moving toward contact with an enemy force on the western fringes of their vast empire. Historians know about some specific situations that demanded such large mobilizations of forces on a war footing. The Egyptian revolt of the 460s was an operation like this. When it was completed, however, the Persians had learned a lesson and did not abandon their conquests. The territory
7. Bennett and Blakely (1990) take a very conservative position, unwilling to suggest what the Greek pottery or pits at Tell el-Hesi may connote. 8. Hoglund rightly argues that this is a mid–fifth-century fortress. A small village was contemporaneous with the fortress. Parallels for such situations are known from other sites. “Camp followers” were not uncommon. Soldiers may have married local girls and established families. Small villages grew up to support these families and the small garrisons of troops. Similar practices are known from the “Roman” Limes, after the large military buildup of Diocletian in the late third and early fourth centuries c.e.

and security along the border had been won with great effort and a high expenditure of men and materials. MOOTW place soldiers in situations that require them to meet specific objectives during peacetime (in this case, the mid- to late-fifth century and the fourth century b.c.e.). These forces provide security for local authorities and secure highways, strategic intersections, toll booths, industrial complexes, and the like. Their presence is intended to promote stability and orderly progress, particularly in the aftermath of war or revolt, when the rebuilding of infrastructure takes precedence, such as in the province of Yehud (United States Army 1979: L1-AS-3-1–L1-AS-3-2). Military forces in an “operation other than war” support diplomatic and political efforts to maintain peace, such as the missions of Ezra and Nehemiah. These soldiers are also a “show of force,” however, lending credibility to imperial promises and commitments. Military forces in an operation other than war also provide humanitarian assistance when needed, they help with reconstruction using military engineering assets (such as rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem in the mid–fifth century b.c.e.), while also assisting with refugee resettlement, food distribution to the needy, medical treatment and care, and the reestablishment of networks of communication, roads, and water systems (United States Army n.d.: 1-5–1-7). Military forces in an operation other than war would be employed in sufficient numbers to accomplish their missions and to provide for their own security. The “rules of engagement” in these deployments are usually very strictly enforced and are defined narrowly to prevent unnecessary casualties and to allow the force to operate throughout the area of operations with impunity (United States Army 1979: L1AS-3-1–L1-AS-3-2). Some scholars have argued that there is no evidence that military forces were stationed in the region in the Persian period, citing the lack of evidence for “revolts” or rebellion. Traditionally archaeologists look for a thick, ash-filled layer, indicating that the site had been burned in a great conflagration; this, some say, is evidence of a “revolt.” However, fire may only be a sign of a spilled oil lamp, rather than destruction from battle. Stone-throwing crowds of teenagers do not leave behind “ash layers”; they may only leave behind piles of stones on street corners. Stationing highly trained, well-armed professional soldiers in villages and towns throughout the western satrapy Abernahara must have dampened any rebellious tendencies within the local populations. The very nature of MOOTW is one of “heavy involvement with the people of the host nation and its government and military” (United States



Neo-Babylonian Military Operations Other than War 275
Army 1979: 4–7).9 Therefore, most of an army’s activities in this kind of situation are “HUMINT-intensive,” meaning that intelligence is gathered by interrogation, observation, elicitation of personnel, and the exploitation of documents and other material. This sort of “human intelligence” is also used to counter any threats that may arise from within the population, including espionage, sabotage, subversion, and terrorism. This includes nascent rebellion. Sending disciplined soldiers into potentially hostile areas would decrease or neutralize these threats. Local people will seldom take up arms against heavily armed professional soldiers. The mercenaries and other troops employed by the Persian government to police their western provinces were probably these sorts of soldiers. The record suggests that they accomplished their missions well. With problems on the border with Egypt, fortresses were built throughout Yehud, along the coastal plain, the Way of the Sea (Via Maris), in the Negev, and in the city-states of Gaza, Ashqelon, and Ashdod. These fortresses were intended to (1) keep the peace, (2) provide local security, (3) provide humanitarian assistance, (4) provide a “show of force” to keep local populations in check, and (5) be prepared to check hostilities, if necessary. MOOTW were intended by Persian officials to preclude the likelihood of going to war, with its massive investment of financial and human resources. Obviously, however, some situations could not be controlled, and conflicts did escalate. The soldiers stationed in Yehud were there to prevent this eventuality, if possible. Judean soldiers assigned in Egypt had the same mission in the upper Nile River Valley at Elephantine. Furthermore, when Egyptian forces revolted and waged war against Persia, as they did several times in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e. (usually when there was a change of ruler in Persepolis), the forces in Yehud had the mission of facilitating the reception and onward movement of men and supplies destined for the “front.” Today the province would be considered a “power projection platform,” a place from which power was projected into the heartland of the enemy force. Sabotage by hostile forces operating in the “rear” also had to be overcome by whatever means was available. Military leaders always
9. Having soldiers stationed in strategic places through the region gave Persian authorities immediate access to HUMINT—human intelligence. Soldiers on the ground in potential trouble spots provide instant access to information collection and analysis in MOOTW, enabling the occupying force to deal with the subtleties encountered daily by its forces.



276 John W. Betlyon
had to be concerned with protecting their forces, conserving their fighting potential for the enemy. All of these missions were part of the MOOTW carried out by the Persian armed forces in Yehud and neighboring parts of the satrapy in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e.10 These troops were a deterrent against Judean participation in any sort of revolt or war initiated by the Phoenicians, the Cypriots, or the Egyptians. Greek and eastern Greek voices vocally decrying Persian hegemony over the eastern Mediterranean city-states must have been heard “loud and clear.” But it is no wonder that Yehud remained quiet, even when Egypt, Cyprus, and the Phoenician city-states attempted to break away. It is no wonder that Yehud appeared so docile in Persian hands. Soldiers were “in place” to enforce the peace and to curb antiPersian activities in these very sensitive places, so close to the troubled border with Egypt. We assume that local authorities in Yehud received Persian directives and acted upon them affirmatively. But there were many initiatives from the region to tempt Yehud into a revolt. Revolt, however, is a matter of ideas and issues of the mind, and these do not show up easily in stratified remains. Protest marches, rallies against the Persian occupying forces, intrigues to undermine Persian-appointed officials, and even bloody attacks on patrols or troops positioned in or around the many biraniyot that the Chronicler mentions would not produce easily recognizable archaeological remains.11 Yehud may have been far less tolerant of her Persian overlords than we might have expected, given the friendly reports in Ezra and Nehemiah. Dan Barag has gathered some “hard” evidence of revolt, including destruction layers from sites such as Tell Abu Hawam and Tell en-Naßbeh (Barag 1966: 7; Widengren 1977: 500–501). But this evidence is only a small part of what really happened. Elsewhere I have argued that Persia could have assigned a “light brigade” of infantry to the region—a force too small to combat an aggressive Egyptian army but more than large enough to control the villages and towns of Yehud (Betlyon forthcoming). All facets of “rebellion”
10. The military nature of the fortresses is not in question. The nature of the missions assigned to the soldiers who garrisoned these fortresses is of paramount importance for understanding Persian intentions and goals while they ruled over Yehud. The biraniyot enabled the Persian army to put forward a credible military force to underscore governmental policy interests. Political concerns always dominate a “show of force.” 11. The intifada in Palestine is a real “revolt”; yet the remains may be no more than piles of stones on the street, bullet holes in the sides of buildings, or new graves in communities on both sides of “the line.”



Neo-Babylonian Military Operations Other than War 277
could have been easily met by this force, which could also have secured important “choke points,” such as mountain passes, highway intersections, water sources, food distribution points, and industrial areas, in time of war. Several thousand soldiers occupying the fortresses and patrolling the roads could have been ready for anything, while also dealing with day-to-day problems such as civil disobedience, assassination, ambushes of patrols, nonpayment of taxes, strikes by laborers, and so on—all activities falling short of “total war.” This model for imperial provincial administration appears to have been in place no later than the conclusion of the great Egyptian revolt. In other words, by approximately 455 b.c.e., Persian or Persian-allied military forces were engaged in “operations other than war” throughout the western provinces and satrapies. These operations aided Achemenid authorities to hold on to their conquered territories, no matter who was on the throne in Persia.
The Neo-Assyrian Model: Military Force and MOOTW
Ephraim Stern recently argued that the Assyrians not only conquered Samaria in approximately 722/721 b.c.e. but they subjugated most of Judah at the same time. Many sites were damaged or destroyed in the Assyrian campaigns of the mid- to late eighth and seventh centuries b.c.e. Even so, stone memorial stelas were found at Samaria, Ashdod, Ben-Shemen, and Kakun, and other Neo-Assyrian inscriptions were found at Sepphoris, Tell Keisan, Samaria, Gezer, and Hadid (Stern 2000: 47; Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: 35, pl. 4:2–3; Kapera 1976; Porath 1985: 58 n. 3; Macalister 1912: 22–29; Becking 1983; Reich and Brandl 1985; Donbaz 1988: 6 n. 13; Sigrist 1982; Cogan 1995; Beckman 1977: 81–82, no. 3). Additionally, Assyrian structures have been unearthed at Ayeleth ha-Sha ̇ar, Gezer, Tell Jemmeh, Tel Serao, and Tel Haror, as well as a line of fortresses that was established along the Via Maris (Stern 1993; Wolff 1996). Throughout the country, Assyrian-style gates and fortifications were built, and in the north, Mesopotamian-style open-court houses replaced the typical Israelite four-room (or pillared) plan (Stern 2000: 48 n. 9; Amiran and Dunayevsky 1958; Fritz 1979; Reich 1992a). Assyrian influences even included burial customs, with Mesopotamian-style clay coffins found at sites in all the territories of Northern Israel under direct NeoAssyrian control, which included Dor, Megiddo, Tel Qatif, Dothan,



278 John W. Betlyon
Samaria, Tell el-Faroah (North), and Jezreel (Stern 2000: 48 n. 10; Zorn 1993; 1997; Ussishkin and Woodhead 1997). These signs of Neo-Assyrian influence in Israel and Judah illustrate the Assyrians’ efforts to rebuild and reutilize a new “Israel” following Samaria’s fall at the end of the eighth century b.c.e. Indeed, Megiddo was rebuilt by Neo-Assyrian authorities, who turned it into their own provincial capital controlling the regions of the Galilee and the Jezreel Valley. Unearthed structures rebuilt by the Assyrians stand in stark contrast to finds in the Neo-Babylonian period, when the policy of destruction and deportation was strictly enforced, with no apparent exceptions (Stern 2000: 48–49) Assyrian forces initially destroyed villages and towns that resisted their dominion. We know this destruction was total and ruthless. However, this policy was reversed. The Assyrians rebuilt almost every destroyed town, sending in large numbers of new people from other lands, on a scale seldom seen in the long history of the region. The rebuilding of Megiddo, Dor, Dothan and other towns completely changed the character of the desolated countryside (Stern 2000: 50–51). Stern rightly observes that the Neo-Babylonians did nothing to “reverse the damage inflicted during their initial phase of domination when, in addition to destroying, burning, and looting all the settlements they occupied, they also systematically deported the inhabitants of the region whom they did not kill. Unlike their Assyrian counterparts, the Babylonian authorities never built anything” (2000: 50–51). The region was reduced to poverty under the Babylonians. Perhaps it was in response to this economic situation that the Persians eventually adopted a different policy, reverting to the Assyrian plan, rebuilding and refurbishing infrastructure.
The Neo-Babylonian Model: A Structure for Failure
Archaeologists have found no evidence that Neo-Babylonian administrators did anything to rebuild or repair the infrastructure of province Yehud. There is also no evidence of military occupation in an “operation other than war.” This means that, despite official Babylonian governmental connections to the provincial leadership in Mizpah, Babylon had little to do with the province of Judah. Indeed the province was so ruined, that tribute and taxes must have been meager, at best. Without a presence throughout the province, the Babylonians had little chance of exerting much influence upon developing events. The bizarre tale of Babylon’s final monarch, Nabonidus, means that there



Neo-Babylonian Military Operations Other than War 279
was a vacuum of leadership at the top of governmental and military administration. The result was a short-lived period of hegemony, when a longer period would surely have been possible. Military operations other than war proved to be successful to a limited degree under Assyrian rule. But the Achaemenid kings fully realized the potential of these operations, solidifying their hold on the Levant from the late sixth through the late fourth centuries b.c.e.

Nabonidus in Arabia and Judah in
the Neo-Babylonian Period
André Lemaire
École pratique des Hautes Études, Paris–Sorbonne
At first blush, it may seem strange in a book about Judah and Judeans in the Neo-Babylonian Period to write an essay on Nabonidus, especially “Nabonidus in Arabia.” What is the connection, if any, between Nabonidus in Arabia and Judah in the Neo-Babylonian period, about which we know so little? We may approach this problem from several angles: the Bible, Qumran, iconography, and inscriptions. Even if, according to most of the modern commentators (for instance, Wilkie 1951: 41; Sack 1983: 66; D’Agostino 1994: 93; Ackerman 1997: 34), Dan 3:31–4:34 was originally about Nabonidus and not Nebuchadnezzar, the last Neo-Babylonian king (556–539) does not appear in the Hebrew Bible and, so far, no contemporary text connects him with the province of Judah (Albertz 1998). So, it seems that we are condemned to elaborate on the only literary text connecting Nabonidus and a Jew, that is, the so-called “Prayer of Nabonidus” found at Qumran and designated 4Q242. However, after many studies on this very interesting text (see bibliography in Collins 1997; Martinez and Tigchelaar 1997: 486–87), it is clear that we have only the beginning of it:
Words of the pr[ay]er that Nabonidus, king of [the] la[nd of Baby]lon, the [great] king, prayed [when he was afflicted] by a malignant inflammation, by decree of the G[od Most Hi]gh, in Tema . . . (MLY Í[L]Ta DY ÍLY NBNY MLK . . .).
It apparently deals with Nabonidus in Tema—and not in Judah—and the figure of the exorcist Jew who plays the positive role is not a Jew from Judah but ‘a Je[w] fr[om the exiles . . .’ (WHa [GBR] YHDY M[N BNY GLWTa . . .]), at least if we accept the conjectural restoration generally proposed.

286 André Lemaire
Furthermore, the legendary character of this fragmentary literary text is evident, even though it does draw on historical tradition, especially on two points:
1. The sojourn of Nabonidus in the Tema Oasis, only changing its historical “ten years” into a symbolic ‘seven years’ (SNYN SBo): for once, the legend is less than the truth! 2. The unusual religious ideas of Nabonidus, who was famous for exalting the position of Sin (Lewy 1946) over Marduk.
This competition between Sin and Marduk to decide who was the Most High God (Ackerman 1997: 55–57) may have ended in a kind of assimilation of both gods (Beaulieu 2000: 311) and seems, at first glance, a simple quarrel between theologians. However, it illuminates the religious atmosphere at the time that monotheism was born, along with the clear affirmations of the Deutero-Isaiah prophet:
I am Yhwh/the Lord; there is no other (aanî Yhwh wéaên oôd); there is no god beside me. (Isa 45:5)
The precise connection between the reign of Nabonidus and the birth of monotheism is certainly worthy of research by historians (see, for instance, Vanderhooft 1999: 169–88), especially historians interested in the province of Judah. But there is also the problem of the home of Deutero-Isaiah. Although most commentators think of Babylonia as the provenance of Isaiah 40–55 (see recently Vanderhooft 1999: 169–71; Korpel 1999: 90; Bedford 2001: 63 n. 49; Weippert 2001: 36), Hans M. Barstad has recently tried to show that the texts may not be so clear and that, “In fact, we can probably claim a Palestinian setting as little as we can claim a Babylonian one” (Barstad 1997: 93). Actually, I wonder whether we could not also consider Tema, the capital of Nabonidus in the desert. At least certain verses of Deutero-Isaiah are clearly alluding to a desert connection:
Prepare a road for Yhwh through the wilderness, clear a highway across the desert for our God. (Isa 40:3)
Let the wilderness and its towns rejoice and the villages of the tribe of Qedar. Let those who live in Selao1 shout for joy and cry out from the mountain-tops. (Isa 42:11)
1. See the neb, sometimes translated ‘rock’ (cf. TOB 1975, but see note s): “Soit de la montagne en général, soit du ‘Roc’, nom propre d’une forteresse édomite, 2 R 14,7.”



Nabonidus in Arabia and Judah in the Neo-Babylonian Period 287
I will make a way even through the wilderness and paths in the barren desert; the wild beasts shall do me honor, the wolf and the ostrich; for I will provide water in the wilderness and rivers in the barren desert. (Isa 43:19–20)
If these verses do not show conclusively that Isaiah was himself in the desert, they somehow illuminate the atmosphere of the time during which Nabonidus settled in the oasis of Tema for ten years. Actually, thanks to several Neo-Babylonian texts, the sojourn of Nabonidus in Tema (ca. 552–543) is now clearly admitted as historical, especially after the studies of R. P. Dougherty (1922, 1929, 1933), W. Röllig (1964), W. G. Lambert (1972), I. Ephoal (1984: 179–91), and P. A. Beaulieu (1989: 149–203). Nabonidus himself declares in his Harran stela:
[Sin] made me leave my city Babylon on the road to Tema, Dadanu, Padakku, Hibra, Yadihu even as far as Yatribu. For ten years, I was moving around among these (cities) and did not enter my own city, Babylon. (ANET, 562; D’Agostino 1994: 90; Beaulieu 1989: 151)
This sojourn has been lately illustrated by two new types of documents: the relief of Selao and North-Arabian graffiti. 1. The Selao sculpture was discovered in 1994 by Hamad Qatamine from Muata University, studied by a small expedition directed by Anne Goguel in 1996, and published by Stephanie Dalley and Anne Goguel (1997), as well as Fawzi Zayadine (1999). The rock of Selao is located on the western flank of the Edom Plateau, about 3 km northwest of Bußeirah and about 1200 m above the oArabah. The rock-relief is located halfway up the steepest part. It is engraved in a recess 3 m wide by 2 m high and visible from the bottom of the rock at a distance of about 200 m. It shows the standing figure of a Mesopotamian king whose characteristics allow us to identify him with near certainty as Nabonidus. Unfortunately the Neo-Babylonian inscription on the right is practically illegible. S. Dalley and F. Zayadine agreed that this relief was connected with the campaign of Nabonidus against Edom (see line 17 of the Nabonidus Chronicle), on his way to Tema at the end of 553 or, more likely, the very beginning of 552 b.c.e. (Beaulieu 1989: 169). “Presumably the eroded inscription would have narrated details of this campaign” (Dalley and Goguel 1997: 174). I should like to go a step further and propose that this relief commemorated the main battle between Nabonidus and Edom in Selao.



288 André Lemaire
Three arguments may be proposed in favor of this conjectural interpretation:
a. It is necessary to find a good reason to have such a relief engraved in such an unlikely place, and the commemoration of such a battle seems a good one. b. Selao is already known as the place of a battle against Edom in the biblical tradition of the war of Amaziah of Judah (2 Kgs 14:7; compare 2 Chr 25:11–12). c. Three biblical passages2 probably allude to such a battle: the reference to Selao in Isa 42:11 and Ps 137:9. This last, in a typical exilic psalm, asks for vengeance against the people of Edom (v. 7) because they took part in the destruction of Jerusalem. The last verse states:
Happy is he who shall seize your children and dash them against the rock (hasselao).
Now, besides the mention of Selao (Savran 2000: 56 n. 50), this verse is somehow illuminated by 2 Chr 25:12:
The men of Judah captured another ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of Selao (/cliff) and hurled them over from the top of Selao (/cliff) so that they were all dashed to pieces.
This addition of the book of Chronicles to the battle of Amaziah against the Edomites probably refers to the same place-name Selao, mentioned in 2 Kgs 14:7, but could also allude to the way Edomite prisoners of war, perhaps especially their chiefs (see Ps 141:6), were condemned to death after the battle. Since it is missing in 2 Kgs 14:7, it is probably a kind of midrash inspired either by Ps 137:9 or, perhaps, by the battle of Nabonidus against the Edomites. 2. North-Arabian graffiti: in 1999, in an Arabic book entitled Dirasa Ta ̇liliya Muqarana li-Nuqus min Min†aqat (Ramm) Ganub farb Taymaa (An Analytical and Comparative Study of Inscriptions from the “Rum” Region, Southwest of Tayma), Khalid M. Eskoubi published several North-Arabic, more precisely, Taymanite, inscriptions. Among them two contain the name of Nabonidus. These inscriptions have recently been studied by Hani Hayajneh (2001a; 2001b; see also Müller and AlSaid 2001; Gruntfest and Heltzer 2001)3 with a well-developed philo
2. See perhaps also Num 24:21; Jer 49:16–17; Obadiah 3–4; Ps 141:6. 3. I am very grateful to Hani Hayajneh, who informed me about the content of this article before its publication.



Nabonidus in Arabia and Judah in the Neo-Babylonian Period 289
logical commentary. Winnett and Reed (1970: 88–108) already thought that Taymanite inscriptions were among the earliest North-Arabic inscriptions, and these last inscriptions are a clear confirmation that at least some of the Taymanite inscriptions are to be dated to the sixth century b.c.e. (Lemaire 1995: 59–63). Apparently they were engraved by servants of Nabonidus in the following manner:
1. aN.MRDN.HLM.NBND.MLK.BBL 2. aTWT.Mo.RBSRS . . .
1. I, MRDN, the servant of Nabonidus, the king of Babylon, 2. came with the Rab-saris . . .
or more simply:
aN aNDS HLM NBND MLK BBL
I, aNDS, servant of Nabonidus, king of Babylon.
Another inscription refers only to the “king of Babylon”:
aN.aNDS.SDN.MLK.BBL.NˇRT
I, aNDS, the overseer of the king of Babylon, have guarded,
while another one mentions only the Rab-saris:
1. SKTRSL.BN.SRTN.aT(W) 2. Mo.RBSR(S)
1. SKTRSL, son of SRTN, came 2. with the Rab-saris.
These inscriptions give flesh to the sojourn of Nabonidus in Tema, generally considered to be very enigmatic (Ephoal 1984: 179). Actually, for most commentators, “the purpose of his visit to Arabia and the oasis of Tema remains unclear” (Sack 1992: 974). Several propositions have been made (Beaulieu 1989: 178–85; D’Agostino 1994: 97–108):
• economic reason (control of the trade routes from Arabia to Mesopotamia) • sickness (= impurity), • perhaps even madness?
The last—extreme—interpretation does not seem very likely. At the most, one could call Nabonidus a “visionary” (see von Soden 1983: 68), but his move to Tema seems to have been conscious and almost planned. There are two facts that may explain this move, at least partially (Beaulieu 1989: 190):

a. Nabonidus wanted to follow the tradition of the Assyrian Empire (for the “Assyrian connection”: Mayer 1998: 254–59; Vanderhooft 1999: 52–59), which launched expeditions against North Arabians. b. Nabonidus could not expand northward because of Cyrus’s power; so he tried to expand southward, and taking over North Arabia would make his Empire geographically much more coherent. Tema was, after all, a more central capital than Babylon was.
Whatever the reasons, the successful takeover of North Arabia was a great achievement, and the move to Tema meant the disappearance of the kingdom of Edom, the probable integration of its territory within greater Arabia with its capital at Tema, and a firmer Neo-Babylonian control of southern Palestine, not to speak of the introduction of Aramaic in Arabia. The disappearance of the kingdom of Edom and its probable integration into Arabia (Knauf 1988: 75; Lemaire 1996: 147; 1997: 92) seems to be confirmed by biblical tradition as well as epigraphy: a. The biblical tradition of numerous maledictions against Edom is well known, especially Isa 34:1–15; Jer 49:7–22; Ezekiel 35; and Obadiah (Dicou 1994: 105–14; Glazier-McDonald 1995). One can understand that, since Edomites took over a great part of the territory of the Judean Kingdom (1 Esdr 4:50) and helped Nabuchadnezzar to take Jerusalem (1 Esdr 4:45; Myers 1971: 379), Jews could only rejoice when, about 30–35 years later, the kingdom of Edom disappeared in its turn. Some of the Jews may even have taken part in this campaign (Gadd 1958: 86); however, this is only conjecture. The disappearance of the kingdom of Edom means that, from 552 on, southward, the province of Judah had a border with Arabia. This political context explains the mention of Geshem/Gashmu, the Arab, in the book of Nehemiah (2:19; 6:1, 2, 6) and accords with Herodotus’s tradition of Arab control of southern Palestine (2.158; 3.5, 7, 9; Lemaire 1990: 45–54; Laperrousaz and Lemaire 1994: 24–30). b. During the last 20 years, more than 1,000 Aramaic ostraca have been discovered between Hebron and Lachish and are now in private or public collections. More than 400 have already been published by me (1996; 1999a), I. Ephoal and J. Naveh (1996), as well as by H. Lozachmeur and me (1996; see also A ̇ituv 1999), and hopefully several hundred more will be published soon (see now Lemaire 2002). These ostraca contain many personal names, mainly Aramaic, Edomite, and Arabic, with a minority of Jewish names. The number of Arabic names



Nabonidus in Arabia and Judah in the Neo-Babylonian Period 291
accords with the fact that this country was part of Neo-Babylonian Arabia and later on part of the Arab kingdom of Qedar before the creation of a Persian province called Edom/Idumea at the beginning of the fourth century b.c.e. (Lemaire 1999b). Actually, these Aramaic ostraca are probably connected with the administration of this province of Edom/Idumea between 363 and 313/312 (Lemaire 1999b: 13; 2000). The ostraca confirm that the southern border of the province of Judah probably did not change from 582 to the annexation of Idumea by John Hyrcanus in 112/111—that is, Beth-Zur was the last Judean fortress, while Lachish (Lemaire 1974), Mareshah, and Hebron were in Edom/Idumea or Arabia (contra Carter 1994: 118–19; 1999: 99). Actually, these ostraca mention at least two Idumean toponyms: Maqqedah (probably Khirbet el-Qôm: Lozachmeur and Lemaire 1996: 131–33; Lemaire 2000: 133) and oIdnah (Lemaire 2001; 2002), perhaps the place where they were written. Not only the Negev but most of the Judean Shephelah and a part of the hill country of Judah were outside the Neo-Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenistic province of Judah. In this historical and geographical context, it is useful to consider the problem of the capital of the Judean province. Since the southern part of the kingdom of Judah was no longer part of this province, in a way it is no wonder that its capital moved northward, the new capital being fixed at Mizpah with the appointment of Gedaliah as governor. Now the question is: when did it change again to Jerusalem? This problem does not seem to be discussed much by scholars, probably because, if they accept Alt’s theory that Judah was part of the province of Samaria, this problem does not exist. Jerusalem was capital of the province of Judah only when it was created, that is, with Nehemiah. But Alt’s hypothesis, still defended not so long ago by S. McEvenue (1981: 353–64) and P. R. Bedford (2001: 45), has no serious foundation and is now generally disregarded (Lemaire 1990: 32–36; Blenkinsopp 1998: 37; Lipschits 1998: 483; Mittmann 2000: 28–42). So where was the capital of the province of Judah before Nehemiah? From what we know about Nabonidus and his probable direct control of southern Palestine, there is no reason that the Judean capital would have had to move during his reign. Mizpah was probably the capital of Judah until at least the end of the Neo-Babylonian period. Actually, in the studies that I have read, I found only very short answers4 to the question of the capital of Judah before Nehemiah (see
4. See, for instance, Carter 1994: 127: “The debate concerning when Jerusalem was again designated the capital of an autonomous province must be left for others to settle.”



292 André Lemaire
Miller and Hayes 1986: 424). So, for instance, Blenkinsopp writes, in a footnote: “From Neh 3:7 it appears that Mizpah remained the administrative center of Judah down to the time of Nehemiah” (Blenkinsopp 1998: 42 n. 48). Actually this verse speaks about people from Gibeon and Mizpah belonging to the seat of the governor (pa ̇at) of Transeuphratia and can only be an indirect argument. However, one arrives at the same conclusion by taking into account the role of the capital of a province in the Neo-Babylonian and Persian Empires. Generally, such a provincial capital is called a birtah ‘a fortified town’ (Lemaire and Lozachmeur 1987: 1995). Now we know that Jerusalem was no longer a fortified town after 587, because “the Chaldean forces with the captain of the guard pulled down the walls all round Jerusalem” (2 Kgs 25:10). It was still the same situation when Nehemiah was at the court of Susa: “the wall of Jerusalem was broken down and the gates had been destroyed by fire” (Neh 1:3). It is very unlikely that a Persian governor had its seat in a ruined and unfortified city. Actually, the first thing that Nehemiah did when he arrived in Jerusalem as governor was to build the walls as quickly as possible (Neh 2:11–17). Thus, Mizpah very likely was the capital of Judah not only under Gedaliah but for 142 years, from 587 to 445. This throws some light on the problem of the archaeology of Jerusalem during this period5 and makes a careful study of the archaeology of Mizpah all the more necessary and fascinating. At this point, it may be useful to draw attention to two enigmatic inscriptions from Tell en-Naßbeh: 1. An inscription, probably in Hebrew, was engraved before firing and, following W. F. Albright (in McCown 1947: 168–69), is usually (Renz 1995: 223–24 with bibliography) read as:
[?B]N MRSRZR[KN] ‘[?s]on of Mar-sarri-zera-[ukin]’.
Actually, the shape of the letters is difficult to classify, and we thought for a while that it was an Aramaic inscription (Delavault and Lemaire 1979: 1 n. 1). A better solution is, as proposed by Renz (1995: 223–24), that it was engraved by an untrained hand, since we can compare the shape of the letters, especially M, N, and R, to the same letters in the Hebrew ostracon of Ahiqam from Horvat oUza, written by an untrained hand (Beit-Arieh 1986–87: 36). This comparison shows that such a writing could be as late as approximately 600 b.c.e.
5. See Neh 7:4, “The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it and no houses had yet been rebuilt.”



Nabonidus in Arabia and Judah in the Neo-Babylonian Period 293
Furthermore, on one side, there is clearly a small vertical stroke on the left of the so-called Z, and thus, it is better read as a Í than as a Z. On the other side, if a B should be restored before the first visible letter (N), one should expect to see some traces of it. In this context, one could think of a name such as:
[?]N MRSRÍR[?, [?]? Mar-sarri-ußur[?6
Such a name would be parallel to aSRSRÍR, BLSR(a)ÍR, NBSRÍR, SNSRÍR (WSS 8507) (Maraqten 1988: 233–48)8 with MR as a theonym (APN 257; WSS 1094). However, such a name seems to follow the Assyrian tradition of transcription of the sibilants, not the Babylonian one (Millard 1976). In this case, we should not use it for the Neo-Babylonian period! However, after the discoveries of the Seh Óamad/Dur Katlimmu tablets, we know that Assyrian scribal tradition went on into the early Neo-Babylonian period (Postgate 1993: 109). Under these conditions, the use of Hebrew writing by the provincial Judean administration under Gedaliah does not seem impossible, and one could even tentatively date from this period the incised Moßah inscription on a jar-handle published by N. Avigad (1972: 5–9). This inscription was soon followed by the Aramaic Mozah stamp impressions (Zorn, Yellin, and Hayes 1994: 175, 183). 2. A fragmentary cuneiform inscription with 11 Neo-Babylonian characters incised on a slender bronze circlet. It is generally read (McCown 1947: 150–53; Zorn 1997: 66):
?]a-ia-da-ra sar su(/kissati)? ana bala† napisti-su [?
?]Ayadara, his king(/king of the world) for his life [. . .
But so far, King “Ayadara” or “?]ayadara” is unknown, and this inscription is very enigmatic! In summary, the main changes during the reign of Nabonidus concern the clear affirmation of monotheism, on the one hand, and the probable integration of Edom into Arabia, on the other hand. Even if we do not know the names of the governors at Mizpah, during the reign of Nabonidus, Neo-Babylonian control was still very strong, while the
6. One could also think of reading [S]NMRSRÍR[?, but such a name lacks parallels and would be difficult to explain. 7. The dating of WSS 850, “no earlier than the second half of the sixth century,” may be an error for “seventh” century. 8. The ending -ußur is well attested in the Bible: SRaÍR (2 Kgs 19:37; Isa 37:38), NBWKDRaÍR, BLS aÍR, SNaÍR.

province was limited southward by Neo-Babylonian Arabia, which included sites such as Lachish, Mareshah, oIdnah, Maqqedah, Hebron, and probably Ein-gedi. Our study led us also to propose two working hypotheses:
1. Before using Aramaic (and Akkadian?), the Babylonian province of Judah may still have used Palaeo-Hebrew writing under Gedaliah. 2. Mizpah was the capital of the province from 587 to 445 b.c.e.

Ideology and Archaeology in the
Neo-Babylonian Period:
Excavating Text and Tell
Charles E. Carter
Seton Hall University
Biblical scholars and archaeologists have often neglected and/or misinterpreted the Neo-Babylonian period. Like the Persian period, it owes much of its darkness to the interest of the writers of the First and/or Second Testaments and later interpreters in the “golden ages” of monarchic Israel/Judah and nascent Judaism(s) and Christianities.1 Additionally, scholars who did examine the Neo-Babylonian period tended to accept uncritically the basic chronology and ideology of the biblical writers.2 Any emphasis placed on the Neo-Babylonian period gave pride of place to the Babylonian community and the leaders of the Jewish community that was relocated there. Scholars acknowledged that Jewish communities existed in Palestine and Egypt but placed considerably less value on either one of them, except as it related to the dominant golah community. It was the Babylonian community that was credited with composing and/or editing the bulk of the Torah and Prophets. Some suggested that the entire “Primary History” (Genesis through 2 Kings) was edited in the
1. This disinterest in the period is combined with a lamentable anti-Jewish polemic in the work of the many Christian scholars, perhaps most notably, Julius Wellhausen. His claim that the Priestly source/editor and the documents produced by that community marked the nadir of biblical religion has been uncritically followed by generations of biblical scholars. Yet, whether one accepts or rejects the traditional dating of P, there are many reasons to reject the Wellhausenian view and to see these traditions instead as providing a vigor and insight that Wellhausen only believed possible in the preexilic prophetic voices. See the more extended discussion in Carter 1999: 31–39. 2. One of the earliest exceptions to this trend was C. C. Torrey, whose critique of the concepts of “exilic” and “postexilic” periods was rejected if not ignored by most of his contemporaries. It has received a more sympathetic hearing in the past decade in some areas of Hebrew Bible scholarship, having been accepted though perhaps modified by P. R. Davies, L. Grabbe, R. Carroll, and others. Some of Torrey’s most important contributions to this discussion have been collected in Torrey 1970. For a recent assessment of the extent and nature of the Babylonian “exile” (deportation?), see Grabbe 1998.

exilic period;3 others would suggest a separate compilation of protoTorah and a relatively final form of the Deuteronomic History. Likewise, considerable portions of the prophetic materials were given a Babylonian setting: Deutero-Isaiah and Ezekiel were composed there as was much of Book of the Twelve, except the books thought to have a Persian period provenance.4 A theological commitment to the biblical orientation, therefore, led to a distinctive lack of attention to the existence and significance of a Jewish community in and around Judah. Given the theological orientation of most nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Hebrew Bible scholarship and archaeological endeavors, it is not surprising that this status quo developed and was maintained until recently.
Ideas, Theology, and Ideology
Before examining some of the more prominent biblical ideologies of the Neo-Babylonian period, we may find it helpful here to define the term ideology itself and to consider the appropriate usages of the biblical traditions in reconstructing the period. In this study I prefer the term ideology to theology since, as many claim, theology has historically been primarily a Christian enterprise, one that was often expressly anti-Jewish and later anti-Semitic.5 From the time that the two reli
3. D. N. Freedman proposed this title for Genesis through 2 Kings in two articles published in 1963 and 1976 and used this framework in other articles concerning the Hebrew canon. Freedman suggested that sometime during the exilic period a version of the Torah and Deuteronomic History was “published” and that shortly after that time (late sixth/early fifth century) a collection of some of the latter prophets was added to this primary history. As part of his mission, Ezra separated these two collections, giving us perhaps an early version of a (then) twofold canon: the Torah and a prophetic collection that comprised the former and latter prophets. He builds on this notion in Freedman 1983; 1990. All four essays have been reprinted as part of a two-volume collection of Freedman’s work, Divine Commitment and Human Obligation: Selected Writings of David Noel Freedman, vol. 1: Ancient Israelite History and Religion; vol. 2: Poetry and Orthography (ed. J. R. Huddleston; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1997). According to S. McKenzie, Freedman’s view has not received a strong following; see McKenzie 1992. 4. G. Garbini provides a helpful summary of traditional and newer datings for much of the Hebrew Bible (Garbini 1994). 5. The contributions of Jon D. Levenson (1987a; 1987b) are particularly instructive. Wellhausen, for example, likened Judaism to a “ghost” and to waters that formerly flowed freely but are now stored in cisterns (i.e., stale rather than “living” [Levenson 1987a: 30]). Schleiermacher considered Judaism to be a “dead” or “mummified” religion (Levenson 1987a: 30 n. 10). Hegel (not a theologian, but writing from a Christian perspective) characterized Judaism as excrement (Levenson 1987a: 30–31). Finally, Eichrodt considered Judaism to be “torso-like” when compared with what he identified as morecomplete or fully-formed Christianity (Levenson 1987a: 37).

gions became separate, much Christian theology was rooted in a desire to disenfranchise the Jewish people and to replace them as “God’s people” (Levenson 1987b). To be sure, theology may be broadly defined as any reflection upon and/or systematic attempt to define the divine and any relationship that might exist between the divine and humankind. But many, if not most, scholars of rabbinic and later forms of Judaism were careful not to consider their reflection on the divine as theology.6 More recently Philip Davies (1992, 1994) and Robert Oden (1987) have objected to the term theology in order to protest the type of hegemony that theology has held over biblical studies and the archaeology of Syria–Palestine. In biblical studies, the work of Noth, von Rad, and Bright embodies this theological orientation. In archaeological studies, the concern of Albright to validate the biblical narratives is well attested (Finkelstein and Silberman 2000; Marcus 2000). His student, G. Ernest Wright, began a move away from this biblical orientation,7 and Wright’s student, William Dever, argued that the term biblical archaeology should be abandoned and replaced by a more secular orientation. Gradually Syro-Palestinian archaeology came to be more widely used for the archaeology of the biblical world.8 So what is ideology? Is it simply a less “offensive” term than theology?9 Are ideas and ideologies the same; and are ideologies “primemovers” in cultural development? It strikes me that ideology is one of those terms that is increasingly used by biblical scholars but rarely defined with any precision.10 But before I attempt to define ideology, let
6. A good example of this tendency can be seen in the works on rabbinic thought by Max Kadushin (1938, 1972) and E. E. Urbach (1979). 7. C. Meyers and E. Meyers provide insight into this development in “Expanding the Frontiers of Biblical Archaeology” (1989). 8. For a history of Syro-Palestinian archaeology, see Dever 1985, 1993, and 2001. Curiously, however, Dever seems to have returned to a more Albrightean perspective in his arguments against P. Davies, T. Thompson, and even Israel Finkelstein, all of whom he identifies as revisionists. A comprehensive assessment of the state of Syro-Palestinian archaeology and its relationship to biblical studies may be found in his recent (2001) work, What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did they Know It?
9. Concerning the relationship between theology and ideology, I would define theology as a particular type of ideology, one that is particularly concerned with the relationship of the God of both biblical Israel and Judah and earliest Christianity. Perhaps we are justified in viewing theology as an ideology when it is approached as a historical set of ideas but as a theology when it is applied to the current setting by individuals or groups who seek to maintain a relationship with this deity. Thus, ideology is more than a less-offensive synonym for theology; the two are related but not the same. 10. S. Briggs (1992) and D. Penchansky (1992) provide useful discussions of the origins of ideological criticism and its recent use in biblical scholarship.

me first address the question of the relationship between ideas and ideologies and the roles that ideas and ideational constructs play in human culture. Ideology is neither a synonym for nor a more sophisticated word for ideas. Nor is it appropriate to dismiss the term ideology as a modern construct that is being incorrectly applied to biblical cultures. Ideas can and do exist apart from ideologies. Ideas may provide an individual’s or group’s understanding of the world around them. The ideas that a deity exists, that the state provides certain benefits to society, that differences exist among and between peoples are not in and of themselves ideologies. What causes any of these concepts to become an ideology is the use of power to enforce them or the attempt to use these ideas to coerce people and cultures into particular behaviors. Thus, one might tentatively define ideology as ideas plus power. This is not to deny that protest groups that lack political control are capable of constructing powerful ideologies. But consider the ultimate aim of the powerless who critique the elite and espouse a more equitable distribution of resources—is it not empowerment? This latter aspect of ideologies suggest that one more element is necessary for an idea to become an ideology: its existence within a community. Thus, one might suggest that ideologies = ideas + power + community.
A brief look at the definitions of ideology by social scientists may be helpful here. Gerhard Lenski suggests that an ideology is a type of cultural information “used to interpret experience and help order societal life” (Lenski, Lenski, and Nolan 1991: 34). All ideologies have three common elements: a set of beliefs about the world, a moral orientation that springs from or validates these beliefs, and a set of norms that define specific acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. These norms may be official— in the form of laws—or informal—in the form of customs and mores (1991: 35–36). In either case, the norms function in service of the overarching ideology. Michael Mann identifies ideological power as one of four major sources of social power that groups and “societies” use (1986).11 Like Lenski, Mann identifies three elements within ideological power: (1) beliefs or “concepts and categories of meaning”; (2) norms that govern interpersonal behavior and identify cultural values; (3) esthetic and ritual frameworks that reinforce these concepts and mores. Ideologies are sometimes thought to mask either false views of reality (what
11. The other three sources are economic, military, and political power, and the four together make up his IEMP (ideological, economic, military, and political) model of understanding the interrelationships of groups within “societies.”



Ideology and Archaeology in the Neo-Babylonian Period 305
we might consider propaganda) or a crass desire for material domination, though Mann would reject the notion that ideologies must embody either or both of these characteristics. People, he argues, are not inherently fools, and will not follow an ideology unless it meaningfully intersects with their understanding of reality.12 Thus, I would define an ideology as a comprehensive view of the world invented or espoused by particular group(s) or people(s) that seeks to give order and meaning to experience and that uses this world view to exert power and/or influence over others. Ideologies usually function as more than a world view; they generally arise from the desire of a ruling class (or a protest movement) either to enforce a particular set of mores or to stir people to particular beliefs and/or actions. Ideologies often validate a particular understanding of the past, present, or future, but all seem to be aimed at present actions;13 hence the notion that ideology is rooted in the desire for power. It is important to recognize, according to Mann, that ideological power functions within a matrix of other types of social power. Ideology undergirds, validates, and sanctions military, economic, and political power. Indeed, without ideological power, the other forms of power are reduced to displays of brute force—it is ideological power that makes the use of the other types of power more palatable. A few examples of the relationship between power and ideology might be instructive here. The ideology that the gods need to be provisioned or that kingship descended from heaven gives the peasantry more of a reason to part with the little surplus that it produces. Certainly, state and temple could extract this surplus without the benefit of an ideology of god or king, but the ideology reinforces the power and the economic stability of both institutions. A similar example might be found in the formulaic differences among Suzerainty-Vassal treaties of the second and first millennium b.c.e. Kinship language (often father-son) is characteristic of these treaties in the second millennium b.c.e. A historical prologue often provides an extensive account of the prior relationships between both powers. These features are intended to suggest that the vassal had more reasons to enter into the relationship with the suzerain than simply the military supremacy of the latter. Treaties known from the Neo-Assyrian period lack both the
12. While I agree with Mann on this point, there are plenty of examples even in recent history of people following ideologies that appear to the outside observer to be strange, if not disconnected to reality. 13. On the important distinction between ideational and behavioral sources of culture, see M. Harris, Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.: Altamira, 1999).



306 Charles E. Carter
kinship language and the pretense of an extended, mutually beneficial relationship between the parties as a reason for the agreement. Indeed, many scholars refer to them not as treaties but as “loyalty oaths.” Also absent is the sense of benefits (blessings) for compliance to the oath; instead only various types of punishment (“curse”) are detailed for the power that might break the oath. This fits well with the reputation the Neo-Assyrians had for the exercise of brute force in political and military arenas. Theirs was a regime in which indeed “might makes right”; there was no need to mask this in an ideology of largesse.14
Archaeological Evidence
The archaeology of the Neo-Babylonian period with the “province” of Judah is limited to a few excavated sites and the remains from archaeological surveys.15 What makes reconstructing this period difficult is its relative brevity, its continuation of Iron II (some would prefer the term Iron III) material culture, and the paucity of excavations with remains dating specifically to the period. The surveys that have provided the most important information are those in the tribal territory of Benjamin (Finkelstein 1993), the hill country of Judah (Ofer 1993), and Jerusalem and its environs (Kloner 2000, 2001). To these one should add the 1967 survey of Judea, Samaria, and the Golan (Kokhavi 1972). Together these surveys demonstrate the importance of combining archaeological data with biblical texts, for the most recent surveys appear to challenge the notion that the territory of the former kingdom of Judah lay in near complete devastation after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem. Excavations in Jerusalem suggest that the capital itself was laid waste, but it is unclear that the entire former kingdom was destroyed.
14. A final example from the last decade of the twentieth century shows what Mann (1986) calls the “promiscuous interrelationships” among these four types of power. According to the West, the Gulf war was fought to “liberate” the Kuwaitis from the aggression of Iraq. According to Hussein, it was fought so that the Arab Nation could defend itself against the imperialist West. Both ideologies functioned to galvanize public opinion and, in the case of the Western alliance, to cement political, economic, and military resolve against a common enemy. The reality behind both facades of ideology, however, was that regional and international access to oil, a strategic economic resource, was behind the war. Few in the West were so naïve as to doubt the economic reasons for the war, although the official ideology was still widely accepted. 15. For the purposes of this study, I use the boundaries of Yehud that I have proposed for the Persian period in chap. 2 of The Emergence of Yehud in the Persian Period (Carter 1999).



Ideology and Archaeology in the Neo-Babylonian Period 307
Nevertheless, the evidence from excavations within the Neo-Babylonian territory of Judah is limited to seven occupied sites and possibly five tombs. Excavations were conducted at Beitin (Bethel), Tell el-Fûl (Gibeah of Saul), el-Jîb (Gibeon), and Tell en-Naßbeh (Mizpah). Salvage excavations at Kh. Er-Ras (S) revealed remains of an industrial complex. To these we should add two sites that have recently been excavated but are not yet published: Mozah and Nebi Samwîl (biblical Ramah?), so while we know that they were occupied in the NeoBabylonian period, we do not yet know the nature or extent of their remains (Stern 2001). Two tombs from the area around Jerusalem (Mamilla and Ketef Hinnom) and three in the territory of Benjamin (Tell el-Fûl, Tell en-Naßbeh, and Kh. oAlmit)16 suggest that people were buried in Judah in the Neo-Babylonian period, even though the ideology of an empty land has been proffered by biblical authors! Since the nature of the remains at some of these sites is the subject of other papers in this volume, I will only summarize some of the major finds from each. A more complete description may be found in my Emergence of Yehud in the Persian Period (Carter 1999) and Stern’s recent work on the archaeology of the Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, and Persian periods (Stern 2001).
Beitin (Bethel)
Albright and Kelso conducted excavations at Beitin over four seasons, in 1934, 1954, 1957, and 1960. Minimal architectural remains dating to the period were discovered; presumably some of the Iron II structures would have continued in use during the Neo-Babylonian period. This would explain Stern’s reference to a building associated with a cult site (Stern 2001: 347; see also Kelso 1993: 194) and would support the common assumption that sacrifices were offered at Bethel after the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple in 587/586 (Blenkinsopp 1998). A Neo-Babylonian seal with parallels to Ein-gedi and Kh. Nijam was purchased from villagers, and is dated generally either to the Neo-Babylonian or the Persian period (Carter 1999: 125; Albright and Kelso 1968: 51, 91). A stone scarab reflecting a Neo-Babylonian style was discovered in the 1960 campaign, but it was not found in a clear archaeological context. The pottery from the site is characteristic of the
16. Stern dates the tomb to the Neo-Babylonian period, though I have not had the opportunity to reexamine the excavation report (Stern 2001: 343). Dinur notes the existence of Iron II remains but does not identify them specifically as Neo-Babylonian (Dinur 1986: 1).



308 Charles E. Carter
late seventh/early sixth centuries b.c.e. Paul Lapp identified the pottery from Area II of the 1934 excavations as part of the “latest sixthcentury horizon” (Lapp 1970: 181 n. 14). Kelso suggests that Bethel was destroyed during the reign of Nabonidus (Kelso 1993: 194).
Tell el-Fûl (Gibeah of Saul)
Excavations by Albright (1922–23, 1933) and Paul Lapp (1964) show important remains at this site that had been fortified in the late seventh/early sixth centuries b.c.e. According to both excavators, there is evidence for a minor destruction level, perhaps in 597 (Albright 1924; Sinclair 1964) or 587 (N. Lapp 1981), after which the village seems to have increased in size. Some of this expansion is evidenced in extramural occupation. The most important ceramic remains from the site are from a homogeneous grouping from Cistern 1. Paul Lapp dated the pottery to the last half of the sixth century, suggesting an abandonment of the site at around 500 b.c.e. Nancy Lapp refined this dating, dividing the third stratum into two phases. Stratum IIIA is Late Iron II (650–587) and Stratum IIIB dates from 587 to 538, thus suggesting that the site was abandoned at the end of the Neo-Babylonian period.17
El-Jîb (Gibeon)
Six seasons of excavations at el-Jîb were conducted by James Pritchard, from 1956 to 1960. This site was rich in ceramic and epigraphic remains and provided evidence of significant storage facilities. The epigraphic remains are primarily in the form of inscribed jar-handles, many of which bear the name of the town, ˆ[bg. Others have personal names and the names of at least two other Benjaminite cities. Pritchard tended to date these to the Late Iron II period, primarily in the seventh century b.c.e., but in 1962 Cross suggested that the epigraphic remains should be dated broadly to the sixth century b.c.e. (a dating that is now questioned).18 What Cross says of the inscriptions, G. E. Wright concluded about the ceramic remains themselves: while Pritchard had dated them to the seventh century, most in fact represent a sixth-century (that is, Neo-Babylonian) horizon. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the el-Jîb excavations is the existence of what Pritchard interpreted as a thriving wine industry.
17. This is based in part on P. Lapp’s study (1970) that used Stratum V of Bala†ah as one of the exemplars of Persian period pottery. According to N. Lapp, pottery that parallels Stratum V of Bala†ah is absent from Tell el-Fûl; therefore, the village must have been abandoned before the early Persian period. 18. As pointed out by André Lemaire in discussions during the Tel Aviv conference.
spread is 6 points long

This was deduced from a series of underground pits that Pritchard suggested functioned as a wine cellar in which the inscribed jars would have been stored (1954). N. Lapp and P. Lapp challenged this interpretation and proposed instead that the pits were grain storage facilities similar to those found at Tell en-Naßbeh and Tell el-Fûl (N. L. Lapp 1993: 448).19 In either case, it appears that el-Jîb was occupied during the Neo-Babylonian period and functioned as something of a regional storage facility.
Tell en-Naßbeh (Mizpah)
In the biblical traditions Mizpah is identified as the site of the NeoBabylonian provincial capital. The excavations seem to support this interpretation. While the stratigraphy of the site is notoriously difficult, the most recent interpretation suggests the presence of both administrative complexes and dwellings for the elite who are thought to have lived at Tell en-Naßbeh during the Neo-Babylonian period. Zorn identifies five strata at the site, with Stratum 2 dating to the Neo-Babylonian period through the middle of the Persian period. Several three- and four-room houses date to the period, some of which are larger than their Stratum 3 counterparts. In addition, a large public complex was discovered in the northeast portion of the tell. Much of the pottery from Tell en-Naßbeh is characteristic of Late Iron II ceramic traditions, something one would expect in the Neo-Babylonian period. According to the original excavation reports, some Greek pottery was discovered in dwellings and cisterns at the site, some of which were dated to the midto-late sixth century. No summary of the Tell en-Naßbeh remains would be complete without mention of the numerous but enigmatic m(w)ßh impressions, 30 of which were recovered at the site. According to Zorn the geographic distribution of all of these impressions20 closely resembles that of the former tribal territory of Benjamin, which he believes “was most likely the heart of the Babylonian province” (1993: 1102).21

Iron Age–Persian period remains.” Outside the building was a complex with 16 winepresses with similar form, at least one of which is contemporaneous with the building. Adjacent to the building and winepresses was an agricultural terrace (Zehavi 1993: 66–67).
The Ketef Hinnom and Mamilla Tombs
Cave 24 in the Ketef Hinnom complex, excavated in five seasons by G. Barkay, was in use from the late seventh century through the sixth and perhaps into the early fifth century. While the Greek coin from Kos, dating to the latter half of the sixth century, is perhaps one of the most spectacular find of the tomb, ceramic remains are characteristic of Late Iron II and Persian period pottery. Soundings that Barkay conducted under a Byzantine church on Ketef Hinnom revealed domestic pottery that also dates generally to the Iron II through early Persian periods. Barkay believes that this indicates that, in addition to the cemetery, a small fortress or hamlet was occupied opposite the walls of Jerusalem and thus suggests that settlement continued around Jerusalem in the Neo-Babylonian period (Barkay 1994). His contention that “ritual activities were still carried on in the ruined temple” is conjecture, with no basis in the archaeological remains. The Mamilla excavations revealed a complex of tombs, one of which was apparently in use from the Late Iron II period through the Persian period. Artifacts that date roughly to the Neo-Babylonian period and that parallel those discovered at Ketef Hinnom indicate as well that the area around Jerusalem continued to be used for burials in the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods (Reich 1994).
Conclusion
Archaeological evidence for the Neo-Babylonian period is sparse at best. Excavations show most of the settlement in the area of the former tribal territory of Benjamin, north of Jerusalem. The tombs just discussed near Jerusalem, however, may indicate that a small settlement around the former capital existed, and if not, they show that the site was still “prime real estate” for burials. Does this, then, lead to the conclusion that the Babylonians adhered to a “scorched-earth” policy with the former Judean state? If the excavations were our only data, the answer might be affirmative, but surveys suggest a different response. In particular, I refer to the surveys of Avi Ofer and Amos Kloner, though the former is more extensive in its reach. The remains from Kh. Er-Ras (S) would not have been known apart from Kloner’s recently published survey. More important is the work of Ofer. His survey of the hill coun

try of Judah points to continuity rather than discontinuity in the area south of Jerusalem. It is true that Ofer combines the Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods in his work, a periodization that is problematic. It is also true, however, that he regards the results of his survey as a corrective against the view of Albright and many of those who followed him that the entire kingdom of Judah was destroyed and left barren and uninhabited. It is not accurate, therefore, to dismiss the Neo-Babylonian period as being absent from the archaeological record of Syria–Palestine. Minimal evidence is not the same as no evidence. While it is true that the type of imprint that we have from the Neo-Assyrian period is not evident in the Neo-Babylonian period, this does not mean either that the Neo-Babylonians systematically destroyed the entire kingdom of Judah or that they quickly reestablished its productive capacities. Unlike Hans Barstad, I do not think that “life went on pretty much as usual.” There was very likely a substantial disconnect, given the absence of a monarchy and its attendant infrastructure. And the imprint of this disconnect is present in the biblical traditions themselves. An empty land? Not at all. A subsistence-level economy for those who remained, probably overseen by a Neo-Babylonian appointee? A good guess. And the best we can do here is guess.
Biblical Ideologies
Having defined ideology in the first part of the paper and examined the archaeological witness, we must now examine some of the prominent ideologies of the Neo-Babylonian period. By naming it NeoBabylonian instead of the exilic period, I am making a conscious choice not to be bound by the biblical writers’ world views or ideologies. The ideology of the golah was powerful; indeed it has framed a particular vision for the Jewish community for much of its history since the destructions of 586 b.c.e. and the Maccabean revolt; since the destruction of 70 c.e. and the revolt against Hadrian (Cohen 1987). For many Jewish thinkers throughout history, a perpetual Jewish golah was a direct result of the breaking of the covenant by the Israelites and Judeans. The Deuteronomic ideology, then, has informed and been a formative force for generations of Jews who, until 1948, had no homeland. This sense of loss was reinforced through liturgies mourning the destruction of the Temple, in which notions of exodus and exile are juxtaposed (Yerushalmi 1982: 43).



312 Charles E. Carter
The issues surrounding the minimalist and maximalist debate in the last decade are not dissimilar from questions this essay raises for the Neo-Babylonian period: how should we understand the biblical traditions? And how do we interpret the archeological remains? Do we use the Bible as our primary source? Is it simply one of many (more accurately, few) sources? Do we adopt its ideologies, do we seek merely to give them voice, or ought we to critique them as we critique other biblical and cultural viewpoints? My answer to these questions is by now clear, but I repeat it here for emphasis. We ought not to adopt the biblical writers’ ideologies uncritically, but we should also avoid simply naming them. We ought instead to look beyond them at other historical and cultural markers, in order better to understand both the ideologies and the traditions they produced. I view the Hebrew Bible as I view any other literary remain from the archaeological record—it is one of many sources that gives voice to the past. Like the remains from Tell en-Naßbeh or Beitin, it must be excavated, its contexts recovered, its stratigraphy carefully analyzed, and its site mapped as fully as possible. However, unlike the remains from archaeological excavations, it has been for many a living document, its witness applied to communities of faith whose history was quite different from those who produced it. We may argue whether a particular artifact or ecofact belongs to a particular period, but this cultural remain has had a living past and present that the artifact or ecofact cannot have had, unless, of course, it is linked with the biblical record. So, what ideologies most likely come from the Neo-Babylonian period? I must confess that I would be more confident in attempting to answer this question were we speaking of the Persian period. Perhaps the question should not be what ideologies come from the Neo-Babylonian period but, rather, what ideologies have been retrojected to the period, since it appears that some Neo-Babylonian period ideologies emanate from the golah community itself. In the paragraphs that follow, I shall look at these from the perspective of the period in which they originated.
Judean Ideologies from the Neo-Babylonian Period
Here, the prophetic messages of Jeremiah in the time leading up to and immediately after the Babylonian deportation of 597 and destruction of 586 are most instructive. Jeremiah’s message may be divided into two subgroups: pro-Babylonian and anti-Egyptian ideologies. As a member of the pro-Babylonian party, Jeremiah identifies the Babylonians as Yhwh’s chosen instrument to punish the Judeans for their



Ideology and Archaeology in the Neo-Babylonian Period 313
offenses against the covenant (Jeremiah 20–22). This viewpoint simply applies the Deuteronomic ideology to the emerging events of the early sixth century. Jeremiah repeatedly counsels the Judeans not to resist the Babylonian military advances, for Nebuchadnezzar is Yhwh’s servant (db[; Jeremiah 25). The Judeans who were deported to Babylon Jeremiah likens to “good figs,” while those who remained in Judah he likens to inedible figs (Jeremiah 24). The good figs will ultimately be restored and replanted; the bad figs will be banished and will become “a reproach and a byword, an object of ridicule and cursing.” Jeremiah also declares that the yoke of Babylon is to be accepted as Yhwh’s will (Jeremiah 27). For this he is threatened with death (Jeremiah 26), charged with treason, and imprisoned (Jeremiah 37–38). Jeremiah’s letter to the exiles counsels them to prepare for a long stay—build houses, plant gardens, get married, engage in business as usual (Jer 29:4–7). Ultimately, after seventy years of serving the Babylonians, the Lord will bring the people back to Judah (Jer 25:8–14; 29:10–14). The anti-Egyptian rhetoric also serves to establish the legitimacy and primacy of the Babylonian Jewish community. Gedeliah himself had encouraged the Judeans not to fear the Babylonians, to serve them “and it will go well with you” and to “settle in the towns you have occupied” (2 Kgs 25:22–24, Jer 40:9–10). This ostensibly led to the return of many Judeans who had fled to Moabite, Ammonite, and Edomite territories (Jer 40:11–12). After the assassination of Gedeliah, a group led by Johanan and Azariah, and unnamed army officers approach Jeremiah and ask for guidance (Jer 42:1–3). Jeremiah seeks the Lord and instructs them to stay in the land, where Yhwh will certainly prosper them. However, he continues, they are not to go to Egypt. If they do, they will provoke Yhwh to anger, and the same fate that befell Jerusalem will befall them there. They will not escape God’s judgment, which will come through the same sword, famine, and pestilence that they seek to avoid. Though they will long to return to their homeland, they will perish in Egypt (Jer 42:13–22). The Egyptian diaspora community is therefore doomed from its inception. Since, according to Jeremiah, the rest of the people who had remained in the land after Jerusalem’s destruction in fact fled (or were forcibly led by Johanan and the army officials) to Egypt (Jer 43:4–7), the land was left empty.22 This anti-Egyptian rhetoric serves,
22. The motif of the empty land is not explicitly stated in the text but seems to be an appropriate conclusion, given both the deportations at the hand of the Babylonians and the statement that the leaders led away “all the remnant of Judah who had come back to

therefore, to validate the golah group, since those not deported to Babylon were taken to Egypt in defiance of Yhwh’s command. In effect, the group that went to Egypt received the same judgment that Jeremiah had placed upon the Judean community in the previous prophecy of the two baskets of figs (Jeremiah 24). Ultimately, however, Jeremiah was wrong: the Egyptian community eventually became one of three centers of Jewish life and thought.
Ideologies from the Golah Community in the Neo-Babylonian Period
Accepting the biblical ideology of the exile, Daniel Smith (1989) views the exile/deportation as a defining event in Judean history. In his view, the golah community sought to find meaning and stasis in a new, albeit foreign, setting through four adaptive strategies that characterize other communities in crisis. Using a social-science orientation, he identifies the following “mechanisms for survival”: structural adaptation, a split in leadership, development of new rituals, and the development of hero literature. He sees structural adaptation in the development of the new, but I would argue fictionalized, bêt aabôt, which sought to create lines of continuity between the pre-586 community and those who “return” from Babylon. The split in leadership is embodied in the conflict between Hananiah and Jeremiah, each advocating a very different attitude toward Babylonian policy. Ritual adaptation is evident in the purity laws that establish new ethnic and religious boundaries, ones that both create and heighten the distinction between oppressed and oppressors and, in the case of the golah community, those Jews who were not “exiled.” Finally, Smith sees in the Joseph narratives, the Servant Songs of Deutero-Isaiah, and the Daniel stories the development of a hero literature intended to give hope to an oppressed community of deportees. Although these strategies were developed by the golah community during the Babylonian exile, they continued to have a direct effect on the broader Jewish community, particularly during the Persian period.
The Deuteronomic Ideology
A generation ago, virtually all scholars placed the final editing of the Deuteronomic History sometime in the early exilic period and pro

Ideology and Archaeology in the Neo-Babylonian Period 315
posed Babylon as its literary and historical context. Using this understanding, I should have treated it under the previous heading (the golah ideology). This view has recently been challenged, with some, though a minority, proposing the social location of the Deuteronomic school in Jerusalem during the Persian period (Person 1993; Davies 1992). Whatever dating is appropriate, it is clear that the Deuteronomic ideology was one of the winners of the cultural wars of the Persian period. This may be seen in some of the early Persian period prophetic texts (Zechariah 1–8) as well as the Ezra–Nehemiah traditions. The history itself claims that the destruction of Jerusalem and deportation of at least the elite was a result of the continuous breaking of the Deuteronomic covenant. The litany of sins in 2 Kings 17 (written primarily to explain the fall of Israel) included Judean failures (2 Kgs 17:19–20); the judgment statement of 2 Kings 24–25 left no doubt that the Judeans were punished for the social and ritual sins of Manassehwho typified but intensified the failures of all rulers but Asa, Hezekiah, and Josiah. This ideology clearly disenfranchises the people of Israel and Judah; their failures led to expulsion, though Jeremiah’s own prophecies promised an eventual return. While I am not claiming that Ezra–Nehemiah is Deuteronomic, the ideology in Ezra is at the very least influenced by the Deuteronomic viewpoints (or what might be called Torah-ideology or a Deuteronomic “texture” [Duggan 2001]). An example of this is found in Ezra’s prayer uttered as a result of the report that some of the returnees had intermarried (Ezra 9). Ezra mentions the guilt of the ancestors, for which the people were “handed over to foreign kings, to the sword, to captivity, to pillage, and to humiliation.” This is because, while warned by Yhwh’s “servants, the prophets” (Ezra 9:11, a Deuteronomic code phrase?), they failed to obey the covenant. Ezra wonders how the “surviving remnant” that has been given “a stake in His holy place” will now escape God’s wrath for their new (but old) sin. Intermarriage was one of the primary means of breaking the Deuteronomic covenant, so it is no surprise to see it mentioned in Ezra–Nehemiah, particularly with Ezra establishing the hvmAtrwt as the law of the land. What is surprising, however, is that the ones deemed foreigners might in fact have been Jewish women who were not considered ritually pure by the members of the golah community, a position recently advocated by Eskenazi and Judd (1992). It is worth noting here that these two strategies—establishment of new legal codes and ritual activities are two major ways in which new groups assert ideological power (Lenski 1966; Mann 1986). Lenski

suggests that in times of transition from one ruling base to another the new ruling elite needs to bolster its new claim to power—thus “transforming force into authority and might into right” (Lenski 1966: 52). One of the major forces in this transformation is often rewriting the laws or taking over the position of those in the former regime who wrote the laws. This would seem to be the purpose of Ezra’s missionthough he did not come to power through military means, he certainly claimed imperial authority as he instituted this new law code. It validated the position of the golah group and concomitantly invalidated the claims of any who it wrote out of power. Additionally, ruling elite frequently “uses institutions that shape public opinion.” Says Lenski, “A determined and intelligent elite working through them can usually surround itself with an aura of legitimacy within a few months or years” (Lenski 1966: 52). Reinforcing any ideology is the power of ritual, art, song, and dance. According to Mann (1986), where meaning, norms, and esthetic and ritual practices are monopolized by a distinctive group, it may possess extensive and intensive power. It can exploit its functionality and build distributive on top of collective power. Further, Mann notes that ideological power is often realized in two forms: transcendent and immanent. Both seem to describe the EzraNehemiah traditions. Transcendent power may have a “sacred” quality and is often more diffuse and autonomous. In this form of ideological power, groups may create “a society-like network, a religious or cultural community, out of emergent, interstitial social needs and relations.” Immanent ideological power typically intensifies the “cohesion, the confidence, and therefore the power of an already established social group.” The ritual innovations are retrojected to Moses and ultimately to the God of Israel in order to legitimate the ideology. Here we have the transcendent power, one that expands but also carefully delineates membership in the golah group and its adherents. In this respect, it seems to create a new religious community. The immanent aspect of ideological power also is seen in the golah group that originated in Babylon and considers itself the legitimate extension of the “true Israel.” This group that actually comes from outside of Palestine has the authority of the Empire behind it. As its ideology is enforced, its power base expands and its vision of Israel becomes reality.
The Empty Land
Since Hans Barstad discusses this ideology at length elsewhere in this volume (pp. 3–20, and see Oded’s response, pp. 55–74), I will discuss this theme only briefly. However, this much bears repeating. The



Ideology and Archaeology in the Neo-Babylonian Period 317
idea of the empty land is best seen in two brief passages in 2 Chronicles and 2 Kgs 25:21// Jer 52:27. In the latter, Judah “went into exile out of its land”; however, this notion of emptiness is only stated after the emigration of the remaining Judeans to Egypt. In 2 Chr 36:20–21, the empty land ideology is most clearly stated: at the destruction of Jerusalem (and Judah), God gave all people, young and old, feeble and strong, into the hands of the Babylonians. The entire kingdom was destroyed, its people either killed or exiled. The land was empty for a period of 70 years, fulfilling the prophecy of Jeremiah and providing a perfect sabbath rest. The concept of an empty land is also evident, though from a slightly different perspective, in the Holiness Code. Leviticus 26 sets forth blessings and curses for breaking the covenant. The ultimate curse, as in Deuteronomy 28 is defeat and exile, but the writer of the Holiness Code adds this twist: the land shall be desolate, its cities empty. Thus, the land will enjoy its sabbath rest.
Conclusion
These soundings in both the archaeological record and biblical ideologies present two differing realities. It is important, however, to remember that, just as in excavations there are different strata (with the exception of one-period sites), sometimes concurrent and demonstrating continuity, other times with substantial gaps in both settlement history and material culture, so here we are not dealing with just one ideology. The ideological remains are multivalent and represent multiple social and historical contexts. But do the archaeological and ideological artifacts intersect? I have argued elsewhere that the small, poor Yehud that the archaeology of the Persian period reveals becomes more understandable in terms of the ideology of separation. Is there a similar connection in the NeoBabylonian period? I am inclined to see a disconnect, one based on the ideology of the golah community that we have seen above. The texts in Jeremiah and 2 Kings hedge on the fate of those who were not killed or exiled. On the one hand, some of the poorest of the land are said to have remained, and even some native Judeans who had fled to Ammon, Moab, and Edom returned. On the other hand, most of these are represented as fleeing to Egypt and sure destruction, rather than obeying the word of the Lord and remaining on the land—something that would have resulted in limited prosperity. 2 Chronicles 36 and to a lesser extent Leviticus 26 propose an empty land that enjoyed that sabbath rest it had been denied through years of unfaithfulness to the



318 Charles E. Carter
covenant. This ideology is not at all consonant with the archaeological record, for as we have seen, life went on in some manner in Judah after the destruction and deportations of 597 and 586. Perhaps we can say this much, however: both text and tell when properly excavated agree that the destruction and deportations rendered a different reality in the land, one that was without monarchy and without Temple. A new ideology needed to emerge to explain the failure of both to endure. This ideology seems to have been the ideology of the golah, one that would disenfranchise those who remained in the land, one that distinguished among a clean and accepted Babylonian community (Jeremiah 24, 29), a rejected Egyptian community (Jeremiah 24, 40), and an unclean and rejected community in Palestine (Jeremiah 24, 29; Hag 2:20–24; Ezek 11:14–21; Ezra 10). This ideology has ruled the day for some 2500 years and continues to dominate the interpretive landscape.

Demographic Changes in Judah between the
Seventh and the Fifth Centuries b.c.e.
Oded Lipschits
Tel-Aviv University
Most of the major sites in the land of Israel were excavated during the last century. Despite problems with some of the publications and the need to adapt many of the old conclusions to more modern ceramic, historiographical, and chronological approaches, a fairly reasonable picture of the history of settlement can be drawn from them for most of the historical periods. Since the end of the 1960s, large areas have been surveyed, including almost all of the territory of the kingdom of Judah. Surveys of the Benjamin region, the Judean hill country, and the Shephela were conducted, for the most part, during the 1980s; the majority of these surveys were published in the early 1990s. In addition, Jerusalem and its surroundings have been surveyed for many years, and the two volumes of the survey were published in 2000–2001. These survey data make it possible to draw periodic settlement maps and to distinguish the changes that occurred in the history of settlements in various regions. The combination of excavation data and surveys allows an examination of the history of the country from a varied array of standpoints: from the material culture, and from the social, political, economic, and religious aspects as well. All these may be studied in parallel with historical data generally and biblical accounts in particular. The possibility of formulating an independent historical picture (not reliant on the Bible and as unfettered as possible by prior historiographical and theological perceptions) is a privilege of modern research and is of prime importance regarding even the examination of the biblical descriptions themselves. In this paper, I intend to examine

the demographic state of the kingdom of Judah at the end of the Iron Age (the second half of the seventh and the beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e.) and compare it with the demographic situation of the province of Yehud at the height of the Persian period (mid–fifth century b.c.e.), using archeological tools. The material culture of these two time periods was well defined, and the periods themselves are also well defined chronologically. By presenting the solidly based data of these two time periods, we can show a long, complex settlement and demographic process, at the center of which are the changes that occurred during the Babylonian rule (mainly the first half of the sixth century b.c.e.). The methods of estimating population size on the basis of the archaeological finds, as controversial as they may be, have become better established in recent years, both in terms of the theoretical discussion and in terms of the data base by which populations may be estimated at given periods of time.1 Among the major essays in which the population of the land of Israel was examined, the work of Gophna and Portugali (1988) on the population of the coastal area between the Chalcolithic period and the Middle Bronze Age must be noted, as well as that of Broshi and Gophna (1984; 1986), Finkelstein and Gophna (1993), and Gophna (1995) on the Early Bronze Age and the Middle Bronze Age; of Finkelstein (1989) on the Intermediate Bronze Age; of Finkelstein (1984) and Sharon (1994) on the Israelite population during Iron Age I; of Shiloh (1980) on the Iron Age; and of Broshi and Finkelstein (1990; 1992) on the population of the land of Israel in the eighth century b.c.e. To these, one must add Broshi’s work (1974; 1978) on evaluating the size of population in Jerusalem during the Iron Age, additional studies that dealt with various aspects of the demographic situation during the Bronze and Iron Ages,2 and many studies completed on the population of the land of Israel in later periods.3 Most scholars based the population estimate on a combination of excavations and survey finds in a given region from a specified period,
1. This is not the place to discuss models and the theoretical background of the demographic studies. There are references to these in a large number of the articles mentioned below that deal with the Bronze and Iron Ages. On this subject, see also Portugali 1988; 1989. For literature on the various methods of estimating population, see Finkelstein 1990; Esse 1991: 131 n. 18; Zorn 1994: 32–35; and Carter 1999: 195.

For a summary of the preliminary discussion of population density per dunam, see Carter 1999: 195–99, with further literature. 2.

Demographic Changes in Judah 325
from which they tried to establish an estimate of total settled dunams. This estimate is largely speculative, because the vast majority of the sites (especially the small- and medium-sized sites) have not been excavated. Thus, the figures are based on the general impression of the surveyors and an estimate of the overall area of a site, weighted against the relative quantity of pottery shards from the various periods.4 Despite this deficiency, the estimate of total settled dunams is of great importance. The estimate serves as a fixed number that allows for a comparison among various periods for the purpose of defining the processes of change that took place during those periods in terms of settlement pattern and population size.
4. The publication of the surveys excludes many facts, and this exclusion makes it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the surveys. Among the missing data, one must mention the size of the area relative to the number of surveyors (the overall area of the site, extent of the area surveyed, number of surveyors, the number of times they went over the area and the pace at which they walked, the dexterity of the surveyors, etc.); visibility data and an evaluation of the ability to make finds while conducting the survey (the season in which the survey was conducted, the weather on the day it was conducted, the vegetation above the site, and evidence of human activity in later periods); general data on the survey’s finds (number of pottery shards collected; their size, color, and density; the relative number of identified pieces of pottery; the relationship among the various historic periods; and the manner of documenting the finds and the degree of precision in registering the items); and so forth. The need to unify the data also makes it difficult to collect and process it, because there are large time gaps among the various survey reports and a conspicuous absence of uniformity, which is reflected even in the terminology given to the periods that were surveyed and the subchronological divisions that were made. The lack of uniformity in the survey data is partly the result of differences in the type of the area being surveyed. However, for our purposes, the main problem is the different world views of the surveyors, which are reflected primarily in the quantification of the data and basing it on precise statistics to make estimates of the area and strength of the settlement. This is not the place for a discussion of the worldview of the survey or for judging the different survey techniques. However, inasmuch as these estimates are, ultimately, one of the purposes of the discussion, it is important to note that there are serious methodological problems hampering our ability to estimate the relative size of settlements in any given period on the basis of survey data alone. In my opinion, using the present survey methods, there is no way to arrive at precise estimates of the area of most types of sites. Any attempt to make use of evaluations based on mathematical calculations or the use of fixed formulas is based on data that is itself the surveyor’s estimate. Accordingly, it is better to be aware of the limitations of the information garnered by the survey and to make do with a general evaluation of the characteristics of the site: classification into the main types of settlement sites, estimate of the area of the site at its peak size, and as precise a calculation as possible of the quantities of pottery indicative of each period. This information can serve as the basis of an evaluation of the intensity of human activity on the site throughout the different eras. It is preferable to state in advance that this is only an estimate and to be aware that such an estimate contains elements of speculation. On this subject, see also London 1992: 71 and Zorn 1994: 32, with further literature, as well as Broshi and Finkelstein’s words (1991: 5) in favor of “the educated guess.”



326 Oded Lipschits
Converting the number of settled dunams into estimates of population size is a derivative of the estimate of the number of settled dunams and is dependent on the coefficient of the number of people per dunam.5 In the latest studies, support has stabilized around the figure of 25 people per dunam.6 Although this seems quite high for the population of small villages, and quite low for the populations of walled cities, it seems to be the average and is appropriate for estimating the total population in specified regions, at least as a maximum evaluation of the settled area.7
The Archaeological Data: Processes of Destruction and Continuity in Judah between the Seventh and the Fifth Centuries b.c.e.
Processes of Destruction and Rehabilitation in Jerusalem and Its Environs
The combination of the data from the extensive excavations and surveys that were conducted in the city limits of modern-day Jerusalem and its immediate environs has vast importance in the establishment of a settlement profile of Jerusalem and its environs at the end of the Iron Age.8 In the eighth and seventh centuries b.c.e., Jerusalem
5. On the problems related to this subject, see the review by London 1992: 74–77, with further literature. 6. The figure of 25 persons per dunam is based primarily on ethnoarchaeological studies in traditional societies and the data of rural Arab villages during the British Mandate. This is the coefficient used by Shiloh and most of the researchers whose studies were cited above, and to which many more can be added (see the reference in London 1992: 75, and nn. 27–30 on p. 78). On this subject, see also Zorn 1994: 32–35, and the comparative table on p. 34; Carter 1999: 194–99, with further literature. 7. For the main references to these methods and discussions of various coefficients for calculating population size, see the prefaces to all of the demographic studies cited previously, as well as Portugali 1988: 4–38; London 1992: 74–77; Zorn 1994: 31–48; Carter 1999: 195–98, with extensive further literature. All of the comparisons that researchers bring to the demographic situation in the Arab villages during the British Mandate are evidence that the coefficient of 25 people per dunam is quite high. This was also the main criticism voiced by London 1992: 74–75; and Biger and Grossman 1992: 108–21. However, because most of the sites were not excavated for the periods with which this study deals, and because the estimates of settled area size are only general, one should make do with an estimate of population based on a fixed coefficient of 25 people per dunam. The use of this coefficient will make it possible to compare the demographic data from the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period with the data from other periods in the history of the land of Israel. 8. I would like to thank Amos Kloner for kindly enabling me to study the finds of the archaeological survey of the map of Jerusalem before its publication. The profile of



Demographic Changes in Judah 327
expanded,9 its population grew, and a large settlement bloc was created around the city. Unfortified neighborhoods were built north of the city walls,10 and agricultural farms lay in the area around it.11 Large villages were found in the more remote ring and apparently delineated the territory known as “the environs of Jerusalem.”12 A wellplanned array of fortresses, which were within these limits, was built in a wide circle around the city.13 On the basis of this compilation of data, Barkay hypothesized that the built-up area of Jerusalem at the end of the seventh and the beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e., including the fortresses and neighborhoods outside of the city wall (and in my opinion, also including the farms that were scattered all over the area of “the environs of Jerusalem”), reached a size of approximately 900–1,000 dunams (Barkay 1985: xiv, 165, 487).14
9. One may learn about the boundary of the fortified part of the city principally from the many tombs that encircled it. Barkay collected data on approximately 115 burial caves in the various parts of the necropolis (and see, e.g., 1985: 472; 1991: 103). There are roughly 50 burial caves in the eastern burial ground in the village of Silwan, approximately 15 north of the Shechem Gate, about 38 throughout the Ben-Hinnom Valley, and 12 in the neighborhoods outside of the city wall and in the villages and farms that were around the city. 10. The neighborhoods outside the city wall in the hills north of the city apparently began at the end of the eighth century b.c.e. and reached their highest development in the seventh century b.c.e. (Barkay 1985: 161–65, 500, with further literature). 11. The accepted hypothesis is that the entire area of the new city was the agricultural hinterland of Jerusalem. This area reached up to 10 km west of the city that was enclosed by a wall at that time, some 5 km north, 3.5 km south, and much less of it to the east. In this context, see Barkay (1985: 367–71), who also attributes to the farms several burial caves that are located in the wider sphere within the limits of the modern city of Jerusalem. On this subject, see also Feig 2000: 388–94, 398–409. 12. This array of villages surrounded the Jerusalem territory in which there were only farms (between Mozah in the west, el-oAzariyah in the east, oAnata in the north and Ramat Ra ̇el in the south). 13. Fortresses were found on French Hill and in Giloh, Kh. el-Burj(?), and Abu-Dis (Mazar 1981: 246–48; Barkay 1985: 371–73). There is a fine parallel to this in Samaria. Around the capital, three known fortresses were built, and they continued to exist during Assyrian and Babylonian rule (Zertal 1990: 9–30). Barkay (1985: xi, 373) compares these to the fortresses that existed around Rabbath-Ammon. On this subject, see Kletter 1991: 33–51. 14. In my opinion, an estimate of this entire settled area must include all of the small farms that were included in the archaeological survey in the territory of “the environs of Jerusalem.” The estimates accepted in the scholarship for the limits of Jerusalem at the end of the Iron Age reach approximately 600 dunams (Broshi 1974: 21–26; 1991: 66; Geva
settlement in the Jerusalem region at the end of the Iron Age has been discussed at length in the literature. On this subject, see, for example, discussion by Gibson and Edelstein 1985; Barkay 1985; Lipschits 1997: 246–75; 2001: 132–34; Feig 2000.

From the finds at the excavations in Jerusalem, a clear picture emerges of the Babylonian destruction in all the different parts of the city from the end of the time of the First Temple: in the City of David (Kenyon 1974: 170–71; Shiloh 1984: 3–22; Franken and Steiner 1990: 57); in the Ophel (E. Mazar 1991: 139; 1993: 25–32); in the modern-day Jewish Quarter (Avigad 1980: 52–54); and in the citadel (Johns 1950: 130, and fig. 7, no. 1; Geva 1983: 56–58). In contrast to Kenyon and Barkay’s opinion,15 it seems that the inevitable explanation for the finds is that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians and was emptied of most of its population (Lipschits 2001: 132–34). One of the major sites near Jerusalem at the end of the seventh and the beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e. was Ramat Ra ̇el (ancient Beth-Haccerem). Naaaman suggested interpreting the early edifice of Stratum Vb as the seat of an Assyrian official, built either in the late years of Tiglath-pileser III or in the early years of Sargon, who was nominated to supervise the affairs of the kingdom of Judah and, in particular, the city of Jerusalem (Naaaman 2001: 273).16 After the suppression of Hezekiah’s rebellion, the new residence of Stratum Va was rebuilt on a larger scale and with a quality that befitted the seat of an imperial representative, together with his staff and guard.17 The stores of the palace were made to supply the tribute that the vassal kingdom
15. Based on her excavations in the City of David, Kenyon (1963: 15; 1966: 81–83; 1967: 105–11) hypothesized that the Babylonians did not destroy all sections of the city. In her opinion, some of the residents continued to live there after the destruction and even continued to maintain some of the Temple rituals. Barkay (1985: 266–82, 301–5; 1994: 85–106) expanded on Kenyon’s opinion. Basing his opinion on the finds of his excavations at Ketef Hinnom, he determined that families of the nation’s elite continued to live in Jerusalem after the destruction. Barkay’s archaeological conclusions seem reasonable and well grounded, but it is difficult to accept his opinion, using these scant remnants, to reconstruct evidence for continued life in Jerusalem after the destruction. This surely cannot be proof of continued residence in Jerusalem of people from the elite of the nation. Subsequently, one must reject outright the view expressed by Laperrousaz (1989: 56) that 12,000 people lived in Jerusalem during the period of exile, even before the return to Zion. A population of this size should have been living on 500–600 dunams, and the figures available to us even from the peak of the Persian period are only 20% of that number. 16. This early edifice either was destroyed or abandoned as a result of Hezekiah’s rebellion against Assyria (Naaaman 2001: 274). 17. According to Naaaman (2001: 273), the Assyrians imposed the task of rebuilding the site on Hezekiah (and, hence, the similarity between the architectonic elements in Jerusalem and Ramat Ra ̇el).

was required to pay; hence, one can understand the many stamped handles at the site, most of them dated to the seventh century b.c.e. (Naaaman 2001: 273–74). In contrast to the information concerning the end of Jerusalem, clear evidence on the time and circumstances of the destruction of the late edifice of Stratum Va at Ramat Ra ̇el is lacking. It was either destroyed or abandoned after the Assyrian retreat from the land of Israel during the last quarter of the seventh century b.c.e. (Naaaman 2001: 274).18 However, it is possible that a diminished settlement continued to exist at Ramat Ra ̇el during the sixth century b.c.e., when Jerusalem was in ruins.19 The City of David excavations showed that there was a settlement gap after the destruction. Pottery was found in only a few excavations conducted on the western hill. This pottery is parallel to the pottery found at Ketef Hinnom and can be dated to the sixth century b.c.e.20 This is significant because there is no clear-cut archaeological evidence of the settlement in Jerusalem between the Babylonian destruction and the mid–fifth century b.c.e. It would appear that, with regard to Jerusalem, the interpretation given by Weinberg to the finds of Kenyon’s excavations remains unchanged: Jerusalem was wretchedly poor, not just in the period after the destruction, but also at the height of the time of the return to Zion (Kenyon 1967: 105; Weinberg 1970: 204).21 The settlement that was reestablished in Jerusalem at the beginning of the Persian period was small. The Temple Mount was an area of religious ritual, and the settled area was concentrated on the narrow
18. Compare with Naaaman 1991: 33–41. 19. Barkay (1993: 108) argued that pottery from the sixth century b.c.e. could be identified within the Stratum IV finds. 20. From the finds in the Ketef Hinnom repository (Barkay 1993: 107), one cannot draw any unequivocal conclusions regarding the continued presence of any elite society in Jerusalem. The finds are exceptional and unusual. In addition, one may postulate that, before the destruction, those buried in this tomb lived in Jerusalem, and, after the destruction, they lived in the area surrounding the city (perhaps in the Benjamin region or Bethlehem environs) and continued to bury their dead in the family burial plots. Even if we accept Barkay’s ceramic distinctions and treat the scant and scattered finds that he identified in the western hill as belonging to the sixth century b.c.e., these finds can, at most, attest to the existence of a limited, indigent population that lived around the historical City of David and the Temple Mount, within the limits of the devastated city at the end of the Iron Age. 21. On this subject, see the summary in Lipschits 2001. See also Ackroyd 1968: 25–29; Miller and Hayes 1986: 426; Naaaman 2000: 43. Barstad had a different view (1996: 5354), but it is not clear to me on what basis he says that the destruction of Jerusalem was “enormous and probably impossible.”

ridge of the City of David, where most of the finds from the Persian period were also unearthed.22 In this area, too, the evidence from the Persian period is meager and poor, and the fact that hardly any architectonic evidence has been uncovered reinforces the hypothesis that Jerusalem did not manage to establish itself as a large urban center during the Persian period.23 In light of the scant finds from the Persian period uncovered outside of the limits of the narrow range of the historic City of David, it appears that the built-up part of the city at the height of the period did not exceed 60 dunams,24 and the western hill was abandoned entirely until the beginning of the Hellenistic period.25 It seems that the proper way to define the city at this period is as a Temple, alongside of which there was a settlement both for those who served in the Temple and for a small number of additional residents. During the fifth century b.c.e., after Jerusalem again established its status as the center of the Province of Yehud, the Persian authorities
22. Most of the finds from the Persian period excavated at the City of David at the beginning of the twentieth century were not uncovered in a clear stratigraphic context (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 188–201; Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 67–68; Duncan 1931–32: 139–42). Additional finds from the Persian period were also found in Kenyon’s excavations in the northern section of the eastern slope of the City of David, and naturally, in Shiloh’s excavations. It was only in the excavations held on the eastern side of the City of David that, for the first time, a clearly defined settlement layer from the Persian period was found (Stratum 9; Shiloh 1979a: 168; 1984: 20; Shiloh and Kaplan 1979: 45). Apart from “clean” ceramic material from the Persian period found east of the fortification line, two thin walls were also found in this section that are attributed to this period and that may have been used as supporting walls. Supporting walls and layers of landfill were also uncovered in Areas E-1, D1–2, and B. In area D, an additional section of the city wall was unearthed and corroborated evidence for its course along the top of the ridge’s slope, greatly reducing the size of the city limits (Shiloh 1979b: 16; 1983: 130; Ariel 2000: 97–98). Although Shiloh’s excavations uncovered the major proof of the Persian period, the stratum from this period is meager, and the main find attributed to it was from outside the new line of fortification (Kenyon 1974: 182–85; Shiloh 1984: 14, 29; 1984: 57). The dating of the stratum was made primarily on the basis of the pottery shards and seal impressions typical of that period, as well as a small silver coin dated to the first half of the fifth century b.c.e. (Ariel 1990: 99–100, 111–13). 23. On this subject, also see the estimates of Weinberg 1970: 204; and Stern 1982: 34. 24. The accepted estimates of Jerusalem’s size during the Persian period range in the area of 130–40 dunams, of which 80 are on the Temple Mount and some 50–60 are at the Ophel and in the City of David. On this subject, see Tsafrir 1977: 34; Kenyon 1974: 18285; Broshi 1978; Williamson 1984; Ofer 1993: 2.204–5; Carter 1991: 109–20; 1999: 148, 2012. In my opinion, it is a mistake to include the Temple Mount in calculating the settled area of the city. Carter (1991: 150, table 2; 1999: 190, 201–2) rightly estimated the settled area in the city at some 60 dunams. 25. On this subject, see the summary of the finds from the western hill, together with a discussion, in Lipschits forthcoming.

rebuilt and resettled Ramat Ra ̇el (Stratum IVb), making it their center of government, which was nominated to supervise the affairs of the province, particularly the city of Jerusalem (Naaaman 2001: 274–75).26 They transferred their center of government there from Mizpah, as indicated by the relative number of mwßh and yhwd seal impressions at Tell en-Naßbeh and Ramat Ra ̇el.27 In spite of the importance of Ramat Ra ̇el as the administrative center of the province, the architectonic finds from Stratum IVb, as in other sites of the period, is remarkably poor, and there is almost no information about its plan and characteristics.28 When settlement in Jerusalem and its environs was reestablished at the end of the sixth or first half of the fifth century b.c.e., a completely different settlement pattern was created. Most of the population was concentrated in the historic City of David, which did not exceed 60 dunams of settled area. Around the city, a very small number of small farms appeared, mainly characterized by the small number of structures (from a single building to three or four buildings), and agricultural installations and terraces were situated alongside these farms. Approximately half of these settlements were established south of Jerusalem, in the area west of Ramat Ra ̇el and Bethlehem, and their presence can be connected both to the administrative center that was situated in Ramat Ra ̇el and to the growth that characterized the entire region of the northern highland of Judah.29 North and east of Jerusalem proper, in the area between Pisgat Zeaev/French Hill and
26. The finds from the Persian period were uncovered mostly in the fills and dispersed across the tell; the main concentration was discovered on the eastern side of the fortress and in the courtyard of the earlier Israelite fortress. In most cases, the find was mingled with other pottery shards and finds from the Hellenistic and Herodian periods (Aharoni 1955: 165–74; 1960: 28–41; 1964: 19–23, 42–48). Aharoni dated all this material, which he assigned to Stratum (IVb), to the end of the Persian period and the transition to the Hellenistic period (NEAEHL 4.1482–83). Stern objected to this and argued that some of the pottery and seal impressions should be dated to the fifth century b.c.e. He found further support for this view in the fragments of Attic pottery (Stern 1982: 35–36). 27. From a total of 42 “mwßh” seal impressions, dated to the sixth century b.c.e., 30 were unearthed at Tell en-Naßbeh and only one at Ramat Ra ̇el. From a total of 412 “yhwd” seal impressions, dated to the fifth through fourth centuries b.c.e., 194 (47.1%) were unearthed at Ramat Ra ̇el and only 19 (4.6%) at Tell en-Naßbeh. On this subject, see Naaaman 2001: 274–75; see also Lipschits 1997: 362. 28. The remains of the few rooms in this stratum were found some 2–3 m south of the Israelite fortress wall (Aharoni 1964: 17–19, figs. 2, 11–15; pl. 17). Besides these rooms, a massive wall was discovered on the eastern side of the excavation area, dated by Aharoni (1964: 18–19) to the fifth through third centuries b.c.e. 29. See more on this in the discussion below.

el-oAzariyah, there were 14 farms, compared with more than 60 farms that had been there during the Late Iron Age. All of the area northwest and west of Jerusalem, which had been settled in a mosaic of small farms in the Late Iron Age, remained desolate of settlement activity throughout the Persian period. The overall area of settlement sites that had existed around Jerusalem may be estimated at approximately 50 dunams at most, so that the total of the settled area in Jerusalem and its environs at the height of the Persian period did not exceed 110 dunams. In comparing the data between the Iron Age and the Persian period, we find a decline of 83.5% in the number of settlements, from 170 in Iron Age II30 to 28 in the Persian period.31 The region close to Jerusa
30. In the survey data, 197 sites from the Iron Age are listed. Of these, 27 sites are registered as burial caves. These sites were not taken into account here. 31. In this region, 30 sites from the Persian period were listed (except, of course, for the city itself). One site was classified as a burial cave, and pottery from the sixth century b.c.e. was found there (Ketef Hinnom). Two sites are doubtful, because the pottery assemblage discovered in them was not clearly classified. For the purpose of calculation, 28 sites are classified here as Persian period.

lem, at a range of up to 3 km from the city, saw an even sharper drop, a decline of 89% of the number of settlements.32 A parallel decrease is also noted in the estimated total settled area (from approximately 1,000 dunams at the end of the Iron Age to approximately 110 dunams in the Persian period). These data reinforce the evidence of the discontinuation in use of the family tombs around Jerusalem and the sharp decline in the amount of pottery from the Persian period found at the various sites. Together, these data confirm a very low level of human activity during this period.33 The first conclusion that arises from the survey data is that, between the Iron Age and the Persian period, there was a sharp decline in settlement, the demographic significance of which, for the “environs of Jerusalem,” was more than 90%. If we assume (based on the data from the excavations in Jerusalem) that the finds from the Persian period reflect a demographic recovery that began at the end of the sixth century b.c.e. and continued during the fifth century b.c.e., we may safely conclude that in the sixth century b.c.e. the drop in settlement was even more drastic and that Jerusalem and its environs experienced a veritable settlement vacuum. This would mean that the region closest to Jerusalem suffered a mortal blow at the end of the Iron Age, causing the evacuation of most of its population. This drop must be related to the Babylonian onslaught on Jerusalem and the blow probably suffered by the immediate environment of the city during the long months of the siege.34 This region was not settled again until the Persian period, and even then recovered only partially and in limited fashion, another indication of the extent of the damage. All of this supports my previous hypothesis that Jerusalem remained desolate through the period of Babylonian rule (Lipschits 1997a: 272–75; 2001: 129–42). As long as the city had not recovered, there was no economic basis for villages and farms in Jerusalem’s immediate environs; the villages and farms that were maintained were located in the Benjamin region, north of the city, and in the Bethlehem district in the south. In light of these finds, the possibility may also be raised that, similar to Hadrian’s policy toward the Jews after the Ben-Kusbah revolt
32. In this area, 134 Iron Age sites were surveyed (not including the burial caves). Only 15 sites were classified as being from the Persian period (not including the tomb at Ketef Hinnom and another site, in which the pottery assemblage discovered there was not classified clearly). 33. These two points arose in a conversation that I had with Prof. Kloner and Mr. Alon de Groot. I wish to thank them for this. 34. On this subject, see the summary by Lipschits 1997: 272–75; 2001.

(135 c.e.), the Babylonians prohibited Jews from settling in Jerusalem. If this were not the case, it would be difficult to understand why at least some of the refugees did not return to the city and why the city did not experience any recovery until the beginning of the Persian period.
Processes of Collapse and Destruction in the Southern Part of the Judean Hills and in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys
The unprecedented flourishing of settlement experienced in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys in the course of the seventh century b.c.e. was short-lived.35 Aside from the settlement sites and the fortresses that were excavated in this area, in the surveys conducted by Beit-Arieh and Govrin pottery shards from the end of the Iron Age were uncovered at 37 sites, most of them quite small.36 The overall settled area in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys at the end of the Iron Age is estimated at 116 dunams.37 Taking into account the characteristics of the settlement, the alignment of the area, and the areas not yet surveyed, one must be satisfied with a summary evaluation of approximately 120 dunams.38 In most of the Negev fortresses, one can detect clear evidence of destruction that took place at the end of the Iron Age: in the fort at Óorvat oUza and in the small settlement that existed nearby,39 in Stratum VI of
35. On this subject, see, e.g., Beit-Arieh 1985: 17–24; 1995: 310–15; 1999: 1–3; Naaaman 1987: 4–15; 1991: 48–49; Halpern 1991: 62; Finkelstein 1994: 176–78; Meshel 1995: 173–74. 36. In the survey conducted by Beit-Arieh, pottery shards from the end of the Iron Age were uncovered in 30 settlement sites (Beit-Arieh, personal communication), and, in the survey conducted by Govrin (1992), 7 additional sites were found (nos. 3, 10, 11, 63, 162, 216, 271). 37. The overall settled area of the 30 sites surveyed by Beit-Arieh can be estimated at 15 dunams at most (Beit-Arieh, personal communication). The overall settled area of the 7 sites surveyed by Govrin can be estimated at 8 dunams at most. An additional site, a bit larger in area, apparently existed at Bir es-Sabao, in the area of the Bedouin market of modern-day Beer-sheba can be estimated at approximately 10 dunams (Gophna and Yisraeli, in Aharoni 1973: 115–19). 38. The Tel oIra excavations (Beit-Arieh 1999: 173) indicate that the construction in the fortified settlements was not dense, and many areas remained available for processing agricultural produce, storing grain (including many granaries), and additional uses. It appears that this was the situation in the unfortified settlements as well, and one must consider this fact in making demographic estimates. 39. The fortress in Stratum IV was built during the seventh century b.c.e. It is 42 x 51 m, with an area of 2.1 dunams. A settlement of 7 dunams was built north of it. On the major evidence of the destruction of the fortress in the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e., see Beit-Arieh 1986: 37–39; 1994: 34–40; Beit-Arieh and Cresson 1991: 129–33; NEAEHL 3.1157.

the tell of the fortresses in Arad,40 as well as at Óorvat ˇov (Khirbet Tov),41 and Óorvat oAnim (Khirbet oUweina et-Ta ̇ta).42 In at least one of the five fortresses in the Negev (Óorvat Radum), it may be hypothesized that there was an orderly abandonment before the place was destroyed.43 Evidence of the destruction at the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. was also found in the settlement sites that existed in the center of the region, close to the junction of the Beer-sheba and Arad Valleys: Stratum VI of Tel oIra44 and Stratum III of Tel Mal ̇ata.45 No clear traces of destruction were found at Tel oAroer, apparently because Stratum II from the Iron Age was badly damaged in the construction
40. The fortress at Stratum VI dated to the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e. It was 50 x 55 m, and its area may be estimated at 2.75 dunams. One must add to these figures the few structures found outside of the fortress, whose total area may be approximated at 2 dunams (Beit-Arieh, personal communication). It is probable that the fortress existed for only a short time, in direct continuation of Stratum VII (Herzog 1997: 172–79). On the destruction of Stratum VI, see also Herzog et al. 1984: 29. 41. Very little data is available about the excavations at this fortress, but the information reveals that the plan of the fortress was similar to that of the fortress at Arad. It was 38 x 38 m and had an area of approximately 1.5 dunams. This fortress, too, was destroyed, parallel to the destruction of the fortress at Arad (Cohen 1995: 115–16; cf. Óadashot Arkheologiyot 92 [1988] 56–57).
42. Óorvat oAnim (Khirbet oUweina et-Ta ̇ta), located on the southern slopes of the Óebron Hills, is close to the borderline with the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys. Cohen excavated the fortress, whose dimensions are 21.5 x 21.5 m. The fortress’s external walls are very thick (approximately 5 m), and its interior area is approximately 11 x 11 m. The built-up area of the fortress may be estimated at 120 m sq. (Cohen 1995: 118). The settlement around the fortress during the Late Iron Age was relatively poor, and a limited amount of pottery shards was discovered on the site (Ofer 1993: vol. 2, appendix 2A, 62, no. 8; pl. 27: c). The excavation itself revealed a few vestiges of walls and floors from the Late Iron Age in limited areas, so it would be difficult to believe that the area of the settlement after this time ever reached more than a few dunams. 43. Excavators at this site detected three different strata of the same fortress that were all dated to the seventh and early sixth centuries b.c.e. The area belonging to the fortress has been estimated at approximately 0.6 dunam (Beit-Arieh 1991: 88; 1992: 107, 111). 44. Stratum VI was built in the first half of the seventh century b.c.e. and is a continuation of Stratum VII, which was destroyed at the end of the eighth century b.c.e. The built-up area at the end of the Iron Age is estimated at 25 dunams (Biran 1985: 25–28; 1987: 26–29; Beit-Arieh 1985; 1987: 34–38; 1999: 176–77, with further literature). On the evidence of the destruction of the site, see Beit-Arieh 1999: 45–49, 76–77, 115. 45. Stratum III at Tel Mal ̇ata revealed two stages dated to the seventh century b.c.e. (Beit-Arieh 1998: 34–35). It seems that this stratum continues the contour of Stratum IV, which was destroyed at the end of the eighth century b.c.e. (1998: 35). On the evidence of the destruction in the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e., see Beit-Arieh 1998: 34–35.

activity that occurred during the Herodian Age.46 In area G close to Tel Masos (Khirbet el Msas) as well, there is no clear evidence of the destruction of the site at the end of the Iron Age, but one may accept Beit-Arieh’s hypothesis that eventually the site was abandoned and its inhabitants gathered together in the fortified zone of oIra before it also was destroyed.47 It seems that the gradual collapse of fortresses and settlements in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys is the best explanation for the archaeological finds and the historical, demographic, and geopolitical processes,48 even though it cannot be proved either archaeologically or historically. The existence of the settlement in this region was contingent upon the ability of the kingdom of Judah to defend it, and when Judah was no longer able to do so (whether on the eve of the destruction of the kingdom or in a process that continued after the destruction), the border fortresses collapsed and, with them, the entire array of settlements. After the destruction, there was a marked process of evacuation of the area, which continued for most of the sixth century b.c.e., and a diminished settlement began to reestablish itself only in the fifth century b.c.e. Nonetheless, a sparse Judean population lived in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys in the Persian period, together with an Arab and Edomite population,49 allowing the speculation that the area was not totally abandoned during the sixth century b.c.e. and that, while the tribes from the south were making their incursion, a sparse Judean population continued to subsist in the region. A process parallel to the one taking place in the Negev also occurred in the southern highland of Judah (in the entire region between Óebron and the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys). Only two major excavations were conducted in this area. In the stratum from the seventh and the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. uncovered at Debir (Tell Rabud),50
46. The area of the settlement during this period may be estimated at 20 dunams (Biran 1987: 29–33; Biran and Cohen 1981: 253, 264; NEAEHL 4.1274–75). 47. Remnants from the second half of the seventh century b.c.e. were uncovered in limited excavations performed at a small tell (4 dunams) in an area located approximately 200 m west of a settlement from Iron Age I (area G). On the various hypotheses regarding the end of the small settlement at Tel Masos, see Kempinksi et al. 1981: 167–68; Fritz and Kempinski 1983: 1.124–27, and see also remarks by Zimhoni, in Fritz and Kempinski 1983: 1.130; NEAEHL 3.1025. 48. See on this the discussion in Lipschits forthcoming. 49. Evidence for the presence of people bearing Judahite names is found in the Aramaic ostraca from the Persian period, which also shows the great diversity of the population in this region. 50.

there were traces of a fire, but there is no tangible proof of destruction. Neither the circumstances of the abandonment of the site nor the period of the settlement gap are clear.51 Similarly, at Óebron (Tell er-Rumeida), the circumstances of the demise of the settlement at the end of the Iron Age were not clarified, but it seems that the Tell was abandoned in the sixth century b.c.e., and there was a settlement gap throughout the Persian period (Ofer 1989: 91; 1993: 2.59–60, 132; 1994: 194; NEAEHL 2.478).52 At most of the sites in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys there was a settlement gap as well, and the next stratum may be dated to the Persian period. There was a settlement gap in Arad, after the destruction of the fortress from Stratum VI, and the next stratum of the site (Stratum V) was dated to the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e.53 Also at Tel oIra, there are remains of pits and buildings (Stratum V) from a new settlement site that was established during the Persian period.54 A diminished settlement was also rebuilt at Tel Masos at some stage during the Persian period.55 An even larger settlement gap (up to the Hellenistic period) can be noticed in Tel Mal ̇ata (Beit-Arieh 1998: 38; NEAEHL 3.949–50). From the surveys, one can detect only 11 additional sites that existed in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys during the Persian period (a decline of
51. On the evidence from the Persian period, see Kochavi 1973: 55, 59, 61; see also NEAEHL 4.1440. Kochavi tried to learn about the destruction of the settlement at the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. from the settlement gap; however, there is no clear-cut archaeological evidence of this. 52. There is no evidence that the settlement had migrated to its new site in the valley at the foot of the tell in the Persian period, and it seems that the settlement activity there began only in the Hellenistic period. 53. This stratum yielded mostly pits, in which many ostraca were discovered (Aharoni 1975: 5). On the basis of the ostraca find, Aharoni hypothesized that there had been a fortress in Arad during the Persian period as well. This is a reasonable assumption and accepted in the scholarship, but there is no archaeological evidence to support it (and see Cohen 1995a: 114, with further literature). On this stratum in the tell, see also Herzog 1997: 245–49. The ostraca from this strata were published by Naveh (1975: 175–214), and they mainly contain instructions for supplying foodstuffs to the animals and people, evidence of Arad’s major role as the central administrative city that must have served as part of the Persian imperial system. 54. It seems that the site of Stratum V was an unfortified settlement that only existed at the edge of the tel and was abandoned at the end of the Persian period (Beit-Arieh 1999: 177–78). 55. Only a scant quantity of pottery shards was found from this period; and see Fritz and Kempinski 1983: 1.127.

more than 75% from the number of sites at the end of the Iron Age).56 The overall area of these sites may be estimated at a maximum of 30 dunams (a decline of approximately 75%). There is a parallel decline between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period in the southern highland of Judah. In this area there is a marked drop (of about 60%) in the number of sites between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period (Ofer 1993: 2.131; 1998: 46–48) and an even sharper decline (of more than 70%) in the overall size of the settled area (from about 300 dunams to about 85 dunams).57 The meaning of these changes is that, practically speaking, the northern and southern Judean Hills became different settlement units. The northern unit was clearly connected with the areas north of it, and one must draw parallels between the settlement processes taking place there and those taking place in the Benjamin region (and see below). The southern unit was clearly connected with settlement processes taking place in the Negev and the southern part of the Shephelah and was discrete from the settlement processes that took place in the northern highland (Ofer 1998: 46–48; Lipschits 1997: 298–99).
Processes of Collapse and Destruction in the Jordan Valley, the Judean Desert, and along the Western Littorals of the Dead Sea
At the end of the Iron Age, an unprecedented flowering took place in the eastern regions of the kingdom of Judah (Stern 1993: 192–97; 2001: 134–38; Lipschits 2000: 31–41). Jericho and Ein-gedi were agricultural and industrial centers that supported a whole array of settlements, particularly along the routes that connected them with the economic and political centers on the mountain ridge.58 The most prominent find from this period was uncovered at Ein-gedi (Tel Goren).59 The beginning of settlement at the Tel (Stratum V) should be
56. In the survey, small amounts of pottery shards were found at several sites (Govrin 1992: sites nos. 3, 63, 87, 162, 174, 205). Apart from the fortress (site no. 205), whose area is 150 x 300 m (4.5 dunams), all of the other sites consisted of isolated structures and small amounts of pottery shards. 57. These estimates are based on data collected in the Judean highland survey conducted by Ofer (1994 [only in the Hebrew version, 1990: 203]; 1993: 2.127–31; 1998: 4748). Nonetheless, Ofer’s overall estimates seem extravagant (Finkelstein 1994: 174–75) and are not uniform in the various publications. The raw data reported by Ofer (1993: vol. 2, appendix 2/a) and a cautious estimate of the area produce a much more modest estimate than the one reached by him. 58. On the importance and significance of this region, see Lipschits (2000: 31–41), with a reconstruction of the trade routes and maps of the settlement (with further literature). 59.

Demographic Changes in Judah 339
fixed at the second half of the seventh century b.c.e.60 An industrialtype settlement was located on this site, on an area of roughly 2.5 dunams, and at the foot of the Tel there may have been a lower city whose size is unclear.61 The settlement at Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) also gradually expanded in the second half of the seventh century b.c.e., and extensive agricultural activity developed in the site’s immediate environs, thanks to the establishment of irrigation systems, agricultural farms, and fortresses (Magen 1983: 57; Stern 1993: 192; 2001: 134; NEAEHL 2.738). On the basis of the rich finds excavated on the slopes of the tell, including a four-room house unearthed on the eastern slope, one may assume that the settlement at this period extended over the entire area of the tell (approximately 40 dunams). The data from the surveys conducted in this region give conclusive evidence of the intensity of settlement activity at the end of the seventh–early sixth century b.c.e.62 At the end of the Iron Age, there was a relatively densely populated settlement in the area between Jericho and Ein-gedi. A large part of the 59 sites included small settlements with few buildings. Several forts were located at strategic sites, and many encampment sites stood alongside. The entire array of settlements in the eastern hinterland of the kingdom of Judah was destroyed at the end of the Iron Age,63 apparently as a result of the collapse of the military and economic system after
60. For a summary of the various opinions in the scholarship about the time that Stratum V was established, and a discussion of the finds from this stratum and their significance, see Lipschits 2000: 31–33; Stern 2001: 136–37. 61. This settlement is remarkable for its many unique finds—buildings with a uniform plan, industrial installations (particularly ovens and large clay containers), and pottery vessels—which attest to a special industry, apparently for the manufacture of perfumes (Mazar, Dothan, and Dunayevsky 1963: 24–58; NEAEHL 3.1191–92). On the unique products produced at Ein-gedi and their importance for the Judean economy at the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e., see Lipschits 2000. 62. The most important and comprehensive survey in this region was conducted by Bar-Adon (Kochavi 1972). Despite the difficult conditions of the terrain, the survey was conducted rigorously, as evidenced by the discovery of only a few additional sites up to the present time. For a summary of the settlement picture in the Jordan Valley and along the western littorals of the Dead Sea, see Lipschits 2000: 38–39, with further literature in n. 5 on p. 40. 63. There are no data to connect the destruction of the sites in the Jordan Valley and along the Dead Sea western littorals with the date of the destruction of Jerusalem (contrary to the view of Stern 2001: 137–38). On the date of the settlement of Jericho at the end of the Iron Age, see Stern 1993: 192, and n. 9 on p. 196, with further literature. See also Stern’s description in NEAEHL 2.738. On the date of the destruction of the settlement at Tel Goren, see Lipschits 2000: 32, with further literature.

Jerusalem was destroyed.64 After a certain period of an absolute lack of settlement activity in the entire region, settlement at Jericho and Eingedi was renewed during the fifth century b.c.e. The industrial site established at Tel Goren at the end of the sixth or beginning of the fifth century b.c.e. spread over the entire area of the Tel (which is only 2 dunams in size). The buildings overflowed down the slope as well, so that the settlement’s total size may be placed at approximately 4 dunams.65 There is almost no information about the small settlement that existed during that same time period in Tell es-Sultan. The pottery finds reveal that it was a small settlement, whose remains were discovered in only part of the Tel, making it doubtful that it was larger than a few dunams.66 The data from the surveys conducted in this region provide conclusive evidence of the severity of the collapse of settlement at the end of the Iron Age. The drop in settlement between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period is estimated at 95%, a rate without parallel in other regions in Judah at that time. In contrast to 59 sites in the entire region between Ein-gedi and Jericho at the end of the Iron Age, only 3 sites were occupied in this region (Jericho, Ketef Jericho, and Ein-gedi) during the Persian period. The rate of decline in the total number of settled dunams was approximately 89% (from approximately 90 dunams at the end of the Iron Age to about 10 dunams during the Persian period). However, assuming that there was a settlement gap during the sixth century b.c.e. in the 3 sites in evidence during the Persian period, we can assume that the collapse of settlements in this region at
64. One could conceivably assume that the total devastation of all of the sites in the eastern part of the kingdom of Judah was the result of a well-planned military offensive mounted by the Babylonian army or auxiliary forces sent to the region. Nonetheless, in some of the sites in the region, one can detect an orderly process of abandonment and a gradual destruction (see, for example, the conclusion reached by Mazar, Amit, and Ilan 1984: 236–50 regarding the circumstances of the destruction of Óorvat Shil ̇a). This orderly process, together with the lack of logic in any organized military campaign to the border areas, reinforces the possibility that the entire settlement array in this region collapsed after the destruction of Jerusalem, in a process that may have begun during the Babylonian siege. 65. On the date this site was built, see Mazar 1986: 86; in contrast, see Stern 1982: 3839. On the structure, design, and characteristics of the settlement of this period, see the summary in Lipschits 1997: 312–15; 2000: 36–37, with further literature. 66. The remains of this settlement had been uncovered in the excavation by Sellin and Watzinger (1913: 79–82, fig. 186; pls. 1, 3, 42), and they correctly dated it to the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e. On this subject, see also Stern 1982: 38. In Garstang’s excavations (1930–36), as well as in Kenyon’s (1952–58), only scant information was added about the Persian period (Kenyon 1964: 201).



Demographic Changes in Judah 341
the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. was categorical and that the area was depleted of its entire population.
Processes of Destruction and Rehabilitation in the Shephelah
It is possible to establish a comprehensive history of the settlement in this region through the combination of data from the excavations conducted in the Shephelah since the end of the nineteenth century and the archaeological survey conducted in the same area since 1979.67 Accordingly, we find that, in the ninth and eighth centuries b.c.e., the Shephelah experienced a massive flowering of settlement activity.68 Then, as a result of Sennacherib’s campaign (701 b.c.e.), the area was dealt a severe blow, from which it did not recover.69 The decline in the settlement is marked in the smaller sites, and it seems that, as the seventh century b.c.e. progressed, the settlement gathered itself into the eastern parts of the Shephelah, with most of the population concentrated in the major cities (Dagan 1992: 261–62; Finkelstein 1994: 173). These cities were refortified and again became the western border fortresses of the kingdom. The total built-up area in this region in the
67. The data from the Shephelah survey, based primarily on Dagan’s M.A. thesis, 1992: 259–63; see also 1996: 136–46. It must be emphasized that the survey published from this region is only partial, and many data collected since the early 1990s have not yet been published. In his thesis, Dagan focused mainly on the Iron Age, and the data from the Persian period was pushed aside. He does not even include all of the data on the Persian period as presented, for example, in the emergency survey (Kochavi 1972). 68. The quantity of pottery vessels parallel to Stratum III at Lachish is significant at almost every one of the Shephelah sites and constitutes evidence of the intensity of human activity, particularly in the eighth century b.c.e. 69. As of the early 1990s, a bit more than 50% of the entire Shephelah had been surveyed. In the survey, 276 sites were identified that contained pottery from the end of the eighth century b.c.e. The overall area of these sites is estimated at 4,651 dunams. In contrast, pottery from the seventh century b.c.e. was found only in 38 sites. The overall area of these sites is estimated at 1,124 dunams. These data reflect a decline of 86.2% in the number of sites and 75.8% in the total size of the settled area. The significance of the survey data lies in the agreement between the data and the number of exiles mentioned in Assyrian sources about the Sennacherib campaign. It is probable that the problematic economic, political, and security conditions in the region as the seventh century b.c.e. advanced (the rending of territory from Judah, the presence of the Assyrian army, the destruction of fortresses on Judah’s border, and the flourishing of the kingdom of Ekron) contributed to the dwindling of the population. It is reasonable to assume that after the grave blow that the Shephelah suffered during the Sennacherib campaign (especially during the siege of Lachish), there was not enough manpower to populate the settlements and rebuild them. On this subject, see Dagan 1992: 259–63; Naaaman 1993: 112–15; Finkelstein 1994: 173, 176.



342 Oded Lipschits
second half of the seventh century b.c.e. may be placed at approximately 900 dunams.70 The dwindling of the settlement in the Shephelah continued in the sixth century b.c.e., when the Shephelah became a settlement and geopolitical frontier.71 Evidence of the destruction of the fortified cities in the Shephelah in the early sixth century b.c.e. may be seen as the “opening of the door” to the heart of the kingdom of Judah by the Babylonian army.72 The major evidence of the Babylonian destruction comes from excavations in Stratum II of Lachish (Tell ed-Duweir).73 The intensity of the devastation in this stratum was apparent to the excavators and included traces of a raging fire, arrowheads, evidence of breaches in the city wall, and overall destruction of the buildings (Tufnell 1953: 56–58). The site contains no evidence of settlement renewal until the mid–fifth century b.c.e. (1953: 48). Nonetheless, it is difficult to accept the view that links the renewal of settlement at the site with the activity of the people who returned to Zion from exile during the beginning of the Persian period.74 Lachish never reverted to being a part of Judah; the plan of the palace built in the center of the site and the characteristics of its construction and the finds uncovered there demonstrate that it was built by the Persian ruler, apparently as the center of the province known in later periods as Idumea.75
70. This estimate is lower than Dagan’s estimate (1992: 259–60), in which the maximum settled area was 1,124 dunams. Dagan himself (1992: 260) admits that he calculated the entire area of the tells, despite the uncertainty of whether it was totally settled. For a lower estimate than the one given here, where the entire settled area of the Shephelah in the period consisted of 800 dunams, see Finkelstein 1994: 173. 71. In studying the change that took place in the settlement pattern between the Late Iron Age and the Persian period, I found that the borders of Judah had shrunk, and extensive areas of the Shephelah were no longer included within its boundaries. On this subject, see the detailed discussion in Lipschits forthcoming. 72. Military logic dictates that the conquest of these cities was essential for the army’s thrust into the mountain region; control of this area and the major supply routes that connect the coast with the mountain ridge were necessary for the continued siege of Jerusalem. 73. In addition to Tufnell’s theory (1953: 56–58), see the characteristics of Stratum II at Lachish in Ussishkin 1978: 53–54, 64–67; 1983: 134–36, 146; NEAEHL 3.863; Barkay 1993: 108. 74. See Tufnell’s judgment (1953: 48), and compare it with the opinion accepted by many scholars (NEAEHL 3.864). 75. For discussions that no longer meet the standards of modern research regarding the construction characteristics of the palace at Lachish and its parallels, see Amiran and Dunayevsky 1958; Aharoni 1967; 1975b: 33–40. For a critique of these discussions, see Reich 1987: 182, 185.



Demographic Changes in Judah 343
No conclusive archaeological connection can be made between the destruction of the other cities of the Shephelah and the Babylonian military campaign. Nevertheless, this region contains evidence of a drastically dwindling population and, at most of the sites, there are indications of a gap that lasted at least until the beginning of the Persian period. One can connect these two archaeological facts to both the contents of several of the Lachish Letters76 and the evidence in Jer 34:7: “. . . when the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all of the cities of Judah that were left—against Lachish and against Azekah—for these were the only fortified cities that remained of the cities of Judah.” No clear-cut evidence was uncovered of the destruction of Azekah (Tel Zakariya).77 There are only scant remains from the Persian period, but conspicuous among these is a rare Athenian coin dated to 526–430 b.c.e. (Bliss 1900a: 7–16; Bliss and Macalister 1902: 26, pl. 56: 44). Thus, it can be assumed that settlement activity resumed in Azekah at the end of the sixth century or the beginning of the fifth century b.c.e. Settlement activity also resumed at Tel Íafit (Tell eß-Íafi) as early as the fifth century b.c.e., apparently after a gap of approximately 100 years, which began with the destruction of the Iron Age settlement. An analysis of the find reveals that, along with pottery vessels from the end of the Iron Age, there are additional remains (among them figurines) dated to the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e.78 At Tell Goded (Tell Judeideh), the gap apparently lasted longer, throughout the entire Persian period.79 At Mareshah (Tell Sandahannah), there was a large gap between the destruction of the city at the end of the Iron Age and
76. See especially ostracon no. 4 in Tur-Sinai [Torczyner] 1940: 106–25. 77. For a review of the history of excavations on the site and the major finds, see NEAEHL 3.1165–67; Dagan 1992: 27–34. On the fate of Azekah, compare with Jer 34:7 and ostracon no. 4 at Lachish, and see Albright’s appraisal, 1960: 30–31. One may accept Dagan’s analysis (1992: 33–34) indicating the ability to distinguish between two main stages that existed in the fort at the top of the tell. The earlier phase can be dated to the ninth and eighth centuries b.c.e. and ended with the Sennacherib campaign, parallel to Strata III at Lachish. The later phase existed in the seventh and early sixth centuries b.c.e. Thus, the fort was destroyed at the same time as the destruction of Strata II at Lachish. 78. For an analysis of the finds at Tell eß-Íafi, see NEAEHL 4.1336–38; Dagan 1992: 34–40. On the finds at the site, see also Aharoni and Amiran 1956: 222. 79. For a general review of the excavation finds, see NEAEHL 1.273–75; see also the analysis by Dagan 1992: 41–45, with further literature. Prominent at the site were pottery assemblages parallel to the one found at Strata III and II at Lachish. In addition, there is evidence of a small Hellenistic settlement.

the Hellenistic city, and finds from the sixth–fifth centuries b.c.e. are very sparse.80 Except for evidence of a settlement gap in the sites that were excavated, the archaeological survey shows that, during the Persian period, an entirely new settlement pattern began in the region. At the end of the Iron Age, the settled area was concentrated in the eastern parts of the Shephelah, in the area at the foot of the western slopes of the mountain ridge. The settled area extended along the mouths of the large wadis, making use of the silt deposits and water sources of the region. In contrast, during the Persian period, the settled area was concentrated in two major locations:
1. In the area north and northeast of Mareshah and Beth-govrin, there was a fairly dense bloc of nine sites. It is probable that these sites are part of the rural zone of Mareshah, about which there are accounts from the Hellenistic period.81 2. In the area between Beth-shemesh and W. Ha-Elah are four “clusters” of small sites that create a settlement bloc bounded by W. Zanoa ̇ and W. Nativ on the east, W. Ha-Elah on the south, and the road between Beth-shemesh and Ha-Elah junction on the west.82
It may be assumed that this array of settlements that sprang up in the Shephelah during the Persian period and continued to develop during the Hellenistic period was the result of a settlement vacuum that was created in the region during the sixth century b.c.e. This vacuum enabled new people—Arabs and Edomites—gradually to penetrate into the region from the south up to the area north of Mareshah.
80. For a summary of the excavation finds, see NEAEHL 3.1015–17; Dagan 1992: 4547; Kloner 1991; see also Kloner and Eshel 1999: 150. 81. This find is only partial, and one may assume that a complete publication of the survey data will allow a comprehensive reconstruction of the geopolitical and settlement processes that caused the development and shaped the borders and character of Idumea in the Hellenistic period. In the light of this, it is possible to conclude that the border of Yehud province ran west and north from this area; see below. 82. These settlement “clusters” consist of three-to-four sites each: the area of Zanoa ̇, the meeting of W. Sansan and W. Nativ, Tell Yarmut and its environs, and the W. Ha-Elah region. In the distribution of settlements, there are three other salient sites, located on the Tarkumiya-Adullam line, mainly on the upper part of W. Ha-Elah. Noticeable among these is the Persian fortress at Kh. er-Rasm, which could have been part of the line of Persian fortresses in the hill region and may be viewed as the fortress established opposite Mareshah and the rural area that crystallized around it. Alongside it is Keilah (Kh. Qeile), which historical sources place at the center of the southwestern district of the province of Yehud.



Demographic Changes in Judah 345
This incursion was halted only with the reestablishment of the Judean settlement in the northeastern Shephelah during the Persian period.83 The distribution of the sites during this period evinces an ingathering into the area between Beth-shemesh and W. Ha-Elah. If all of the sites in this area did indeed belong to the Judahite province, this is evidence of the western boundary of the province on the Beth-shemesh–Azekah line, up to W. Ha-Elah. The Judahite settlement at this time was concentrated in large- and medium-sized villages, and the central tells of the Iron Age did not yield any evidence of settlement strata from the Persian period.84 There was, overall, a very insignificant presence within the limits of the Yehud province in the Shephelah. According to the finds of the survey, a total of 22 sites may be assigned to Judah within this area. At
83. More than 70% of the Persian period sites in the Shephelah (23 out of 32) were established in places where there were no settlements at the end of the Iron Age. This constitutes evidence of a settlement gap in the sixth century b.c.e. and the creation of a new array of settlements. 84. Considering this state of settlement, the establishment of the Persian palace in Lachish is even more remarkable.

most of the sites, very few pottery shards were found from the Persian period, testimony to a very low level of human activity. Even allowing a large margin of error and taking into consideration the regions not included in the survey, the sum total of settled area in the entire region never exceeds 150 dunams. There was a similar-sized settled area at Mareshah and its environs, outside of the limits of the province of Yehud.
Processes of Continuity between the Seventh and the Fifth Centuries b.c.e. in the Benjaminite Region and in the Northern Part of the Judean Highland
Many scholars have noted the different fate that befell the region of Benjamin and the archaeological reality that prevailed there after the destruction of Jerusalem.85 This region, according to the biblical accounts, was the center of Judah in the period following the destruction of Jerusalem. The region had four important, central settlements that were not destroyed by the Babylonians and, indeed, even flourished during the sixth century b.c.e.86 The central, most-important settlement in Judah at this time was Mizpah (Tell en-Naßbeh).87 The excavations at this site have produced finds indicating full settlement continuity throughout the Iron Age and the Babylonian period.88 In Stratum 2, apparently at the beginning
85. See, e.g., Malamat 1950: 227; Wright 1957: 199; Lapp 1965: 6; Weinberg 1970: 206; Avigad 1972: 10; Weinberg 1972: 47–50; Stern 1982: 229; 2000: 51; Barstad 1996: 47–48; Milevski 1996–97; Lipschits 1999; 2001: 131–35. This view was adopted by most of the summary works that deal with this period, and see, e.g., in Miller and Hayes 1986: 41617; Ahlström 1993: 795; Stern 2001: 321–23. 86. For a detailed discussion of the excavation sites and the resulting archaeological profile, see Lipschits 1999: 155–90. 87. For a review of the history of geographical and historical scholarship, including the fierce controversies surrounding the identification of the site, see McCown 1947: 1349; Muilenberg 1954: 25–42; Diringer 1967: 329–30; and see also the summary in Lipschits 1997: 203. I reject the attempt recently made (Magen and Daddon 2000: 62) to return to Albright’s proposal (1923: 110–12), which identified Mizpah as Nebi Samwîl. At Tell en-Naßbeh, there were five excavation seasons (1926, 1927, 1929, 1932, 1935) directed by Badè. McCown and Wampler, who published the summary reports of the excavation on the site, were unable to present a clear stratigraphic picture. Additionally, because of the way the reports were published and the data presented, there were only a few repeat studies that dealt with the excavation finds. In this light, Zorn’s doctoral thesis (1993) is of marked importance, because of both the processing of the raw material left by Badè and the attempt at presenting a well-formulated stratigraphic profile of its history. For a detailed discussion, see Zorn’s paper in this volume (pp. 413–447). 88. McCown (1947: 181–203), followed by Zorn (1993: 103–62, 312–36), emphasized the continuity of settlement at Mizpah throughout the entire Iron Age.



Demographic Changes in Judah 347
of the sixth century b.c.e., the plan of the city and the fortification system underwent a significant change (Zorn 1993: 151, 161–63, 175–76; Lipschits 1999: 167–68). Mizpah had ceased to be a Judean border city with a diversified Judean population and had become a governmental and administrative center, noteworthy for its storehouses and the number of relatively large residential buildings (Zorn 1993: 167–83; and see also in this volume, pp. 413–47; Lipschits 1999: 167–70). There is also marked settlement continuity at Gibeah (Tell el-Fûl),89 and in most of the settled area there is full settlement continuity.90 One may even assume that, in the first half of the sixth century b.c.e., the built-up area extended beyond the city wall, and the local population grew (Lipschits 1999: 178). Likewise, at Bethel (identified in the village of Beitin),91 no evidence of Babylonian destruction was found, and Albright contends that the settlement continued to exist until a later stage in the sixth century b.c.e.92 This view is supported by the summary reports in which the destruction of the last Iron Age Stratum is dated to the last third of the sixth century b.c.e. (Sinclair 1964: 62; Lapp 1965: 6; Kelso et al. 1968: 37, 75–76). Another site apparently not destroyed at the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. was Gibeon (identified in the village of el-Jîb).93 An analysis of the excavation finds reveals that, at this time, Gibeon even thrived and increased in prominence, and there is no archaeological evidence of destruction of the city
89. For a summary of the subject of identifying the Gibeah at Tell el-Fûl, see Arnold (1990: 39–60, with further literature), but it is hard to accept his historical reconstruction of the Gebao-Gibeah transformation. Four excavation seasons were conducted at Tell elFûl, directed by Albright (1922–23; 1933) and Lapp (1964). For a discussion of the excavation finds on the site in the time span between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period, see Lipschits 1999: 177–78. 90. N. Lapp (1976: 25; 1981: 39) showed that the Babylonian destruction on the site was selective, and except for the destruction of the fortress and one of the buildings in the northeast part of the site, the settlement continued in the sixth century b.c.e. She demonstrated that this sixth-century b.c.e. stratum (IIIb) represents a direct continuation of the settlement stratum from the end of the Iron Age (Stratum IIIa; 1981: 59). 91. On the identification of Bethel, see Albright 1928: 9–11 and Kelso 1968: 1–2. There were 4 excavation seasons held at Beitin, with a gap of 20 years between the first season, conducted by Albright (1934), and the next 3, conducted by Kelso (1954, 1957, and 1960). 92. In this claim, Albright (1949: 142) based himself largely on the dating of pottery vessels to the sixth century b.c.e. and seeing them as intermediate types between the late Iron Age pottery and the Persian period pottery. 93. On the identification of the site, see Albright 1924: 94; Abel 1934: 2.347–73; Pritchard 1960: 1–2. Five major excavation seasons were held at Gibeon under the direction of Pritchard (1956–57, 1959–60, 1962), but the method of excavation and publication do not allow for clear stratigraphic distinctions (Lapp 1968: 391–93).

wall or the various structures at the end of the Iron Age.94 An analysis of the pottery assemblage and mwßh seal impressions found in the winepresses and pits in the northwest part of the tell give evidence of the continued existence of the settlement in the sixth century b.c.e.95 This dating should also be applied to the large cemetery unearthed at the foot of the tell (Eshel 1987: 51).96 At the end of the sixth century b.c.e. and during the Persian period, the Benjaminite region went through a process of depopulation and settlement decline. The settlement at Tell el-Fûl was deserted at the end of the sixth century b.c.e. and the beginning of the fifth century b.c.e.; the settlement remained desolate until the beginning of the Hellenistic period (Lapp 1981: 39, 59).97 At Bethel, the remains from the beginning of the Persian period are scant. It seems that during the fifth century b.c.e., the settlement at this site recovered, and the major evidence of this recovery was found in the central section (Area II), which contains remains of structures that continued to exist until the Hellenistic period (Kelso et al. 1968: 37–38, 52, pl. 7).98 At Mizpah, the circumstances surrounding the end of Stratum 2 are unclear, but it seems that the transition to Stratum 1 was unaccompanied by destruction. Presumably, the settlement at Mizpah existed at least until the midfifth century b.c.e. There are even a small number of finds that show continued existence throughout the Persian period, with a prolonged process of desertion that lasted until the beginning of the Hellenistic
94. Pritchard (1956: 73–75; 1964: 27, 35–40) claimed that Gibeon was destroyed at the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e. and that there is a settlement gap until the first century b.c.e. It seems that his opinion is based on historical considerations and has not been established archaeologically (de Vaux 1966: 130–35), and see the criticism of Albright 1966: 32–33; Barag 1967: 143; Lapp 1968: 391–93. An analysis of the finds shows the opposite picture: the settlement on the site continued in the sixth century b.c.e. and, during this period, flourished even more than previously. For an extensive discussion of the finds for this period and its significance, see Lipschits 1999: 172–76. See also D. Edelman’s discussion in this volume (pp. 153–167). 95. The uninterrupted existence of a settlement at Gibeon at this time is supported by the finds dated to the sixth century b.c.e. in the “Israelite” structures in Area 17 (which include pottery vessels decorated with wedge-shaped and reed impressions, and mwßh seal impressions), and in the 56 gban gdr engravements on pilgrim flask handles, which were discovered in the filling of the large pool. For a discussion of this subject, see Lipschits 1999: 174–76, with further literature. 96. On the finds in some of the tombs, see Dajani 1953: 66–69, and compare with Eshel and Kloner 1991: 39. 97. On this subject, see also Stern 2001: 321–22. 98. This conclusion is problematic, because, at least according to Lapp’s analysis (in Kelso et al. 1968: 77), the pottery vessels from this stratum do not belong to the fourth century b.c.e. On this subject, see also Dever 1971: 466.

period (McCown 1947: 62–63, 185–86, 202, 225–27; Zorn 1993: 184–85). The unique fate of the Benjaminite region during Babylonian rule requires particular caution with respect to the survey’s finds.99 One may assume that, because of the settlement continuity in the region of Benjamin during the transition from the Iron Age to the Babylonian and Persian periods, the finds from the sixth century b.c.e. are included in the survey data as part of the broad definition of Iron Age II.100 One must also assume that the picture that emerges from the survey regarding the Persian period largely reflects the fifth century b.c.e., when the Benjaminite region was in the middle of a process of depopulation and settlement decline. If these assumptions are correct, the finds of the Persian period discovered in the survey reflect this low point, rather than a peak in settlement activity or a stage of rebuilding, such as took place in Jerusalem during this same period.101 The first fact that emerges from the survey is the sharp drop (60%) in the number of sites (from 146 during Iron Age II to 59 in the Persian period). A parallel drop of 56.5% is estimated in the number of settled dunams (from 1150 in Iron Age II to approximately 500 in the Persian period; Lipschits 1999: 180–84). An analysis of the excavations generates the premise that, for both parameters (number of settlement sites and estimate of total size of settled area), the state of settlement in the sixth century b.c.e. was better then that of the Persian period.102
99. The survey’s finds must be interpreted on the basis of the data from the excavations in the main sites. These data show that the central settlement sites in the Benjamin region continued to exist uninterrupted throughout the years of Babylonian rule and dwindled gradually, beginning at the end of the sixth century b.c.e. and continuing throughout the fifth century b.c.e. 100. This is significant, because the sixth century b.c.e. is not recognizable from the survey data and, thus, did not exist there (not even as a period of settlement gap). The result is that the Iron Age II encompassed a period of more than 500 years. On this subject, see the remarks by the surveyors in Magen and Finkelstein 1993: 138, 346. 101. On this subject, see the comment by Finkelstein (in Magen and Finkelstein 1993: 27). The paucity of pottery vessels from the Persian period at the sites where this pottery was found demonstrates a lower level of activity than that which had existed at those sites during the Iron Age. This subject must be taken into account when comparing estimates of the size of the settlement in both periods. 102. This hypothesis is opposed to the one expressed by Finkelstein (in Magen and Finkelstein 1993: 27). Finkelstein hypothesized that in the early sixth century b.c.e., parallel to the destruction of Jerusalem, a severe crisis beset the settlement in the Benjamin region, and the picture was even grimmer than what is reflected in the survey. In the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e., by comparison, a certain recovery took place, which is the situation that the survey reflects. In my opinion, this is a general historical assessment with no archaeological evidence. There is no doubt that the settlement in Benjamin underwent a settlement crisis. However, as stated, the only possible point of comparison here is to the sites that were excavated in Benjamin, which indicate the opposite picture.



350 Oded Lipschits
The sharpest drop in the number of sites occurred in the eastern part of the Benjaminite region, especially the northeastern sector.103 A marked reduction in the scope of settlement was also noted in the northern part of the region of Benjamin (the area of today’s Ramallah).104 These data agree with what we already know about the complete cessation of settlement that took place throughout the Jordan Valley and the western littoral of the Dead Sea. It seems that this, too, was related to the collapse of the economic, military, and political system of the kingdom of Judah.105 One may conclude from these data that in Benjamin, apparently by the sixth century b.c.e., the people had withdrawn to the core of the region. Most of the surviving settlements were concentrated around the main economic and administrative centers in the region, along the mountain ridge and the upper mountain slopes (in the central and western Benjamin region).106 The relative prosperity of this area must be attributed to the political centrality assigned to Mizpah and the economic importance of Gibeon and Mozah. The agricultural hinterland surrounded and based itself on these centers. The gradual impoverishment of the settlement in the region of Benjamin took place at the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth centuries b.c.e., possibly because of the transfer of the provincial center to Jerusalem and the reduced status of Mizpah, as well as the change in economic and security conditions in the region during the
103. East of the line of Bethel-Michmash-Gibeah-oAnathoth, approximately 71 sites from Iron Age II were surveyed, compared with only 14 sites from the Persian period (a drop of approximately 80%). The major decline in number of sites is registered in the area between Michmash and the slope running down toward Jericho. In this area, 27 sites from the Iron Age were surveyed, as compared with only one site from the Persian period, which was located in the northern part of the area. On this subject, see also Milevski 1996–97: 18–19; Lipschits 1999: 181–82. 104. During Iron Age II there were about 12 sites, most of them west of the watershed, compared with only 2 sites during the Persian period. 105. One must also remember that the northern region of Benjamin bordered the province of Samaria. It is doubtful that the leaders of the province of Yehud or representatives of the Babylonian/Persian imperialist regime were able to guarantee safe living conditions to the residents of the border areas. This may have been another reason for the sharp decline in the settlement in northern Benjamin and the abandonment of pasture areas in the eastern part. 106. See on this subject the description and model presented by Magen and Finkelstein (1993: 20–21), and see the assessment of the surveyors as cited there (1993: 138).
In the sixth century b.c.e., the settlement in Benjamin continued to flourish and prosper, and the dwindling of the settlement began in the late sixth and early fifth centuries b.c.e. The testimonies of the centrality of Gibeon at this time as a wine-producing center also oblige us to postulate that there was a strong agricultural hinterland in the region.



Demographic Changes in Judah 351
Persian period (Lipschits 1998: 17–31; 1999: 182–85). These changes undermined the economic base of the settlements in the region, resulting in a marked demographic decline for the Benjaminite region. This decline may be estimated at about 60%: from approximately 1150 settled dunams at the end of Iron Age II107 to about 500 settled dunams in the Persian period. In the northern part of the Judean Hills, the settlement and historical processes between the seventh and the fifth centuries b.c.e. were similar to those of the region of Benjamin. Only one major site was excavated in this area, Beth-Zur (Kh. e†-ˇabaqa),108 where there is no tangible evidence of a destruction at the end of the seventh and the beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e.109 However, many scholars believe that there was a settlement gap that lasted until the beginning of the fifth century b.c.e. (Sellers and Albright 1931: 9; Sellers 1933: 43).110 This is a problematic premise in terms of the archaeological data and does not seem to be based on finds of any kind.111 Aside from Beth-Zur,
107. Compare with the estimate by Broshi and Finkelstein (1991: 10; see also Finkelstein 1994: 175), who estimated the total settled area at the end of the Iron Age at approximately 900 dunams. However, Broshi and Finkelstein only related to 100 of the 146 settlement sites. 108. On the identification of the site and the history of its excavation, see NEAEHL 1.196–98; Ofer 1993: 2.65–73. 109. On the finds from the late Iron Age, see Sellers et al. 1968: 13–24; see also Albright 1943: 8, and n. 9; Funk 1958: 14; Ofer 1993: 70–72. After the first excavation season, the excavators decided that the site had been destroyed by the Babylonians and not resettled until the late Persian period. This argument is rooted in the historical perception that the Babylonians totally devastated Judah, but this claim has no archaeological evidence. 110. Beth-Zur did not yield the seal impressions that were widespread in Yehud province in the fifth and fourth centuries b.c.e., and only one fragment of an Attic pottery vessel was found, which was dated to the early fifth century b.c.e. The chief pieces of evidence from this time period were found in the first excavation season, at Loci 5862, especially in Room 59 (Sellers 1933: 15, fig. 5, pl. 14: 1). Sellers found corroboration for his hypothesis about the gap during the sixth century b.c.e. in the excavations held in the second season, especially in Area II, where a large gap was noticed between the sixth century b.c.e. and the second century b.c.e. (Sellers et al. 1968: 29, 54–69). It was further stressed that very few pottery shards from the Persian period were found in Areas I and III (and see the discussion by Lapp in Sellers et al. 1968: 70–71). Stern agrees with this view (1982: 36–38; 2001: 437–38), as does Funk (NEAEHL 1.197). 111. From an archaeological perspective, one may cast doubt on the hypothesis of a gap between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period. As stated previously, there is no evidence whatsoever of a destruction. In addition, pottery vessels that can be dated to either the sixth century b.c.e. or the early Persian period were found on the site in mixed assemblages with pottery from the end of the Iron Age. Thus, for example, a carrot-shaped Persian bottle was found in Room 146, south of the fortress in a complex of rooms where most of the pottery vessels can be dated to the Late Iron Age (Sellers 1933:

there have been no major excavations in this area and, because of the unclear settlement and historical processes at this site together with the fact that the site is in the margin of the area of Judah, one must base his or her discussion on the data from the surveys. The data of the survey conducted on the highland of Judah indicate a constant increase in the number of settlements and in the overall settled area in the entire mountain region from the eleventh century to the eighth century b.c.e.112 It seems that the entire region was dealt a severe blow during Sennacherib’s campaign (701 b.c.e.), but in contrast to the rapid recovery made by the region north of Óebron (and primarily in the area around Bethlehem), it seems that the area south of Óebron recovered only partially during the seventh century b.c.e., with settlement there remaining sparse.113 The area north of Óebron continued to be within the limits of Judah during the Persian period. There is a marked dwindling in this area as one goes farther south from Bethlehem to Beth-Zur. At the end of the Iron Age, there were 63 sites in this area, most of them either near the major road that passes over the watershed line or close to the roads that split from it eastward and westward.114 One may estimate the overall settled area of these sites at about 305 settled dunams.115
112. For a summary of the settlement picture in the Judean highland at the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period, see Ofer 1993: 4.16–18; 1998: 46–48. Between the eleventh and eighth centuries b.c.e., almost total continuity may be noted in all of the sites; there is expansion into the border areas and a sharp rise in the importance of small settlements (small farms and sites of less than 5 dunams). For a discussion on this subject, see Ofer 1993: 2.121–26. See also the summary by Finkelstein 1994: 174–75. 113. On this subject, see the data presented by Ofer 1993: 2.125–34, 138–42; 4.13–18; 1998: 46–48; see also the critique of Ofer’s conclusions by Finkelstein 1994: 174–75. 114. In most sites, there is no evidence of any emphasis on a topographical location that is convenient for defense purposes, and there is no evidence of fortification. The sites are scattered at distances of 1–2 km from each other (except for “blocs” of settlements of 2–3 small sites) and are located in areas relatively convenient for settlement and agriculture. The dwindling of the number and size of the sites is noticeable as one moves farther east or west from the watershed (Ofer 1993: 2.125–34, 138–42). 115. Of these 63 sites, 6 sites are particularly central: 3 in the northwest (Kh. Zakanda ̇—21 dunams; Kh. Óubeilah—20 dunams; Kh. Judur—19 dunams) and 3 in the southeast (Kh. et-Tuquo—28 dunams; Kh. ez-Zawiyye—18.4 dunams; Kh. Ras e†-ˇawil40 dunams). The overall area of these sites is 146 dunams, which is 48% of the total settled area in the region. To these central sites, one may add 10 more whose area is greater than 5 dunams and whose total settled area is approximately 96 dunams (approximately 31.5% of the settled area in this region). Most of the sites (47, which is approximately 75% of the
20–35). In the water reservoir found in the southern part of the site, many pottery vessels from the Persian period were also discovered in mixed assemblages, together with pottery vessels from the Late Iron Age (Sellers 1933: 27–31; Sellers et al. 1968: 69–70).



Demographic Changes in Judah 353
The characteristics of settlement in this area show a clear continuity in the Persian period.116 There was an 11.5% drop in the number of settlement sites (56 sites in the Persian period as opposed to 63 at the end of the Iron Age). However, there was hardly any change in the scope of settled area (299 dunams in the Persian period, as compared with 305 dunams at the end of the Iron Age, a drop of less than 2%). No settlement larger than 5 dunams in size was abandoned, and the main difference is in the distribution and nature of the settlements. One may define three major changes that took place in the characteristics of the settlement in the transition from the Iron Age to the Persian period:
1. A drastic decline in the importance of the larger sites.117 2. A marked increase in the importance of the medium-sized sites, which were larger than 5 dunams.118 3. A significant increase in the location and importance of the sites smaller than 5 dunams.119
In my opinion, these changes in the characteristics of settlement between the Iron Age and the Persian period reflect a prolonged period of quiet, a time when the population was able to develop in small settlements. The dispersal of the settlement sites and their continued existence over an extended period of time can attest to the respite in the preoccupation with defense during the Persian period and the internal stability that prevailed in the land at this time.
116. Ofer studied this phenomenon (Ofer 1993: 2.131); see also my discussion, in Lipschits 1997: 291–99. 117. This decline is reflected in the number of large sites (from 6 to 3) and the estimated size of the settled area they contained (from 146 dunams to 69 dunams, a drop of about 53%). Before the destruction of Jerusalem, the large sites represented 48% of the total settled area in the Judean highland; in the Persian period they represented only 23%. 118. There is a sharp rise (60%) in the number of these sites (from 10 sites at the end of the Iron Age to 16 during the Persian period). There is also an increase of 50% in the total settled area of these sites (from 96 dunams at the end of the Iron Age to 145 dunams during the Persian period). This is also reflected in the proportion of these sites in the sum total of settled dunams, which increases from 31.5% at the end of the Iron Age to 48.5% during the Persian period. 119. There is no change in the number of sites that belong in this category (37 sites in both periods), but there is an increase of 36% in the total estimated area of settled dunams (from 61.9 dunams at the end of the Iron Age to 85.2 dunams during the Persian period). This is also reflected in the relative weight of the sites of this type in all the settled area, which increases from 20.5% at the end of the Iron Age to 29% during the Persian period.

But the settlement and historical processes in the region between Bethlehem and Beth-Zur were not homogeneous. In the region close to Bethlehem one can see the same number of sites, the same number of settled areas, and the same settlement pattern at the end of the Iron Age and during the Persian period. Nevertheless, there was a marked change in the area around Tekoa. Many sites that existed in this region during the Iron Age no longer existed during the Persian period.120 It is probable that this settlement reflected the economic and security situation that prevailed at the end of the Iron Age, during which a settlement could expand more effectively to the edge of the desert near Tekoa, especially along the main roads leading from the mountain ridge eastward.121 It may well be that this settlement array collapsed due to changing economic, military, and political conditions, thus eliminating the economic base on which most of the settlements surrounding Tekoa relied. It is likely that, bereft of both security in those frontier regions and possibilities for a livelihood, the local populace abandoned most of these settlements during the sixth century b.c.e. During the Persian period, this area saw renewed settlement activity and a totally new pattern of settlement.122 The settlement array in the area of Tekoa, which had spread to the eastern frontier too diffusely at the end of the Iron Age, “moved” westward during the Persian period and settled in more densely-packed concentrations near the watershed line.123 Most of the settlement sites were established where there were more reliable water resources and more diversified possibilities for a livelihood based on agriculture. This region is the heart of the Pelekh of Tekoa, known from the days of Nehemiah, whose importance in terms of settlement in the fifth century is significant. South of the area of Tekoa, mainly in the watershed line around the 3 large settlement sites that existed during the last phase of the Iron
120. Almost all of these sites are located east of the watershed, and most of them may be circumscribed within a radius of about 4 km around Tekoa. 121. The thriving of the desert frontier at the end of the Iron Age parallels the flourishing of the desert frontier in Benjamin at that same time. This situation may be related to the establishment of Ein-gedi, the growth of Jericho, and the establishment of the array of settlement sites in the Jordan Valley and along the western littoral of the Dead Sea (Amit 1992: 347). 122. The survey data indicate that in 21 sites, pottery shards from the Persian period were uncovered, without any evidence of Iron Age pottery shards (or at least not from the end of the period). 123. Apparently, the lack of brisk commercial traffic over the roads that led toward the Judean Desert and the Jordan Valley made it impossible to maintain a densely populated array of settlements east of the watershed line.



Demographic Changes in Judah 355
Age (Kh. Zakanda ̇; Kh. Óubeilah; Kh. Judur), the total number of sites increased from 16 at the end of the Iron Age to 21 in the Persian period. The total settled area in this region increased from 81 dunams at the end of the Iron Age to 104 dunams in the Persian period. The settled area south of Tekoa in the Persian period reached approximately 35% (compared with 26.5% at the end of the Iron Age) of the total settled area between Beth-Zur and Bethlehem. This increase was at the expense of the area south of it, toward BethZur, whose importance shrank considerably. The total number of sites decreased from 13 at the end of the Iron Age to 11 in the Persian period, and the total settled area in this region decreased from 102 dunams at the end of the Iron Age124 to 77 dunams in the Persian period. It may be hypothesized that the area of Beth-Zur declined because it was a frontier area opposite the southern Judean highland and the Negev.125
Demographic Changes in Judah between the Seventh and Fifth Centuries b.c.e.
Table 1 contains a summary of the estimated total number of settled dunams, according to the excavation data and surveys conducted in Judah (based on the discussion above). The main conclusion that emerges from the data is that between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period there was a decline of approximately 70% in the size of settled area. Even if the figures presented for one or more regions in either of these periods is not exact, the final figures are enough to show
124. Almost half of the settled area at the end of the Iron Age is at Kh. Ras e†-ˇawil (40 dunams); there are 5 sites of medium size, whose overall area should be placed at 48 dunams. 125. Apparently, during the Persian period, the area of Beth-Zur was characterized by instability because of the population that made incursions from the south. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, south of Beth-Zur (which had probably been an imperial Persian fortress), there are no known Persian fortresses. In contrast, there are 4 known fortresses north of Beth-Zur that lay along the two major longitudinal roads: Kh. ez-Zawiyye and Kh. Shanah are located on the southeastern road, coming from W. Sioir, and Kh. el-Qatt lies on the main mountain road, about 2 km north of Kh. e†-ˇabaqa. Kh. Umm e†-ˇalao is situated at the vertex of the “triangle of fortresses” and also controls the road running eastward toward Tekoa. In my opinion, these fortresses indicate the course of the southern boundary line of the province of Yehud; this line was established as protection against the population that lived south of it. In this light, it is reasonable to conjecture that the area of W. Sioir from the west and the Beth-Zur line in the east were the certain southern settlement points of the province, and the area south of them was outside of the province limits.

the general trend: between the end of the Iron Age and the Persian period there was a demographic and settlement crisis. It probably took place during the Babylonian rule over the region, and it centered on the campaign against Jerusalem (588–586 b.c.e.). It is not surprising that the sharpest decline occurred in Jerusalem and its environs (89%), which were the focus of Babylonian activities (Lipschits 2001). A similar rate of decline also took place in the Judean Desert, Jordan Valley, and western littoral of the Dead Sea; one may assume that there was a rapid process of collapse in these regions from the moment the kingdom’s administration and army ceased to exist (Lipschits 2000). The heavy devastation in the Shephelah may be explained by the concentrated Babylonian campaign against the fortresses on the western border of the kingdom of Judah and the rapid process of collapse that took place, particularly in the southern part of the Shephelah, after the

As defined above, this refers to the entire region between Óebron and the Beersheba–Arad Valleys (outside of the borders of the province of Yehud) and was not included in the count of the total settled area during the Persian period. c. The settled area of this region only includes the northern limit (consisting of 150 settled dunams), which was included in the border of the Yehud province during the Persian period. An area parallel in size lies near Maresha and south of it and was not included in the total settled area during the Persian period. d. This region was not included in the borders of the Yehud province during the Persian period, and thus, it was not included in the totals for the settled area during this period.

destruction and in the subsequent years of Babylonian rule. The southern border of Judah also capitulated rapidly, and the nomads who had inhabited the area south of the Judean border for many years quickly invaded the empty expanses of the southern Judean Hills and the southern part of the Shephelah. During the Persian period, these areas were not considered part of the province of Yehud. In the region of Benjamin, there was a more moderate decrease (approximately 55%) in the size of the settled area. From an analysis of the central sites in the region, one may assume that this decrease occurred gradually at the end of the sixth and the beginning of the fifth centuries b.c.e. (Lipschits 1997: 196–245; 1998; 1999). In contrast, throughout the region between Jerusalem and Beth-Zur, there is marked full settlement continuity, with an impressive increase in the number of small sites, evidence of a prolonged period of stability and security (Lipschits 1997: 276–99).

words should be offered in explanation. Apart from Finkelstein’s summary article (1994) on the archaeological situation in the days of Manassah, almost no other studies have been published on the demographic situation of Judah during the seventh and the beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e.126 Historical evaluations that were based on lists and descriptions in the Bible resulted in exaggerated and farfetched numbers, double or more than the most “generous” archaeological estimates.127 A comparison with the data collected by Finkelstein shows a striking difference in the overall conclusion: 3,866 settled dunams estimated in this essay compared with 2,250 dunams in Finkelstein’s work (1994: 173, 176–77). The major reason for this difference is the settled area in the Shephelah (according to Finkelstein, 800 dunams, close to the estimate made in this study), which Finkelstein omitted in his calculations. In my opinion, this omission is without either archaeological or historical justification. Finkelstein himself (1994: 173) is aware that, despite the harsh blow the Shephelah was dealt in Sennacherib’s campaign, the settlement in the region did recover to some extent during the seventh century b.c.e. Additional differences in estimates of the settled area are the result of the Jerusalem survey’s new data, which attest to the strength of the settlement in the periphery close to the city (an overall estimate of approximately 1,000 settled dunams, in contrast to Finkelstein’s estimate [1994: 175], which focuses only on the area within the city limits, according to the accepted estimate of 600 dunams of settled area). In addition, Finkelstein does not take into account the total settled area in the Jordan Valley, Judean Desert, and along the western littoral of the Dead Sea (approximately 90 dunams).128 The estimated total settled area in the Negev (1994: 175–76) is also missing 20 dunams of settled area, which must be added, on the basis of the new survey data.
126. On the difficulty in estimating the population of Judah at the end of the Iron Age, see Meyers and Meyers 1994: 281–82. 127. See, for example, the view of Weinberg (1972: 45–50) who, using the biblical accounts and general appraisals as a basis, estimated the population of Judah at 220,000250,000 people. This is further evidence of the caution one must exercise in population estimates that are based either on historical accounts or lists that were preserved in secondary sources that underwent reworking and adaptation for the purposes of the historiographer. 128. Finkelstein (1994: 175–76) mentions this region in the discussion, but neither defines the total number of settled dunams or calculates it in the overall total.

Past estimates of population size in the province of Yehud during the Persian period were based only on biblical accounts, especially the list of people who returned to Zion (repeated in both Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7). This is because most scholars speculated that this list reflected multiple waves of immigration to the province during the days of Cyrus and his descendants, even as late as the days of Nehemiah.129 Up to this point, Carter (1991: 2.150–65; 1999: 195–213) is the only one who has tried to estimate the population of Yehud on the basis of archaeological data,130 but one must reject his archaeological method regarding the Persian period. My criticism of Carter’s work chiefly relates to his classification of the Persian period archaeological finds into two subdivisions: Persian period A (from 539/538 to the mid–fifth century b.c.e.) and Persian period B (from the mid–fifth century to 332 b.c.e.). This division is problematic from almost every angle but especially so in its attempt to define a material culture using historical data. The view that a change in the local material culture can be defined in parallelism with historical information about changes in imperial rule (which is largely the thesis of Hoglund 1992: 202–5) does not stand the test of reality. Carter does not even try to establish the model that he presents: clearly defined assemblages of pottery that are distinguished definitively from a stratigraphic perspective and dated decisively from a chronological perspective. To a large extent, these ideas remain a theoretical model that should not be adopted. Accordingly, his final figures are significantly lower than the figures presented here. A comparison of the summary data from the Persian period with Carter’s data (1991, 1994, 1999) shows striking differences, most of which stem from his methodological approach to the archaeological data and from the distinction he makes between the two segments of
129. It should be noted that the list in Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7 contains the only historical count of all the inhabitants of the province. The total given at the end of the list is 42,360 (Ezra 2:64; Neh 7:66; 1 Esd 5:41), but the total does not correspond with a sum of the various numbers given in the list itself (which, if added up is 29,818 in Ezra 2; 31,089 in Nehemiah 7; and 30,143 in 1 Esdras 5). For the various explanations offered in the literature for these numerical discrepancies, see Zer-kavod 1949: 39–40; Myers 1965: 20–21; Blenkinsopp 1988: 93; 1991: 44. On the basis of these lists, the various estimates of the province’s inhabitants ranged around 50,000. On this estimate, see, for example, Albright 1949: 87–88, 110–11; Bright 1959: 376–77; Blenkinsopp 1988: 83; Smith 1989: 31–35. Weinberg (1972: 46–50) offered an exceptional estimate of about 200,000 people, and following this came his interpretation of the meaning of the list in Nehemiah 7 (= Ezra 2), but see the criticism by Blenkinsopp 1991: 42. 130. Meyers and Meyers (1994) followed the direction taken in Carter’s dissertation.

the Persian period.131 The figures obtained from the archaeological surveys do not enable more than a general dating for the Persian period, and even this has great limitations in identification of the pottery indicative of the period. The division of the data between the two different “phases” of the Persian period requires mathematical speculation with the figures.132 Furthermore, because he is unable to provide a well-established archaeological profile in Judah for both phases of the Persian period, Carter projects the settlement picture in Benjamin onto Judah (although he is conscious of the risky and speculative nature of this measure) and creates a general picture that raises doubts about its compliance with the archaeological data (Carter 1999: 200–201).133 An additional problem with Carter’s study (1999: 103–13, 202) is his regional division, which is based on an analysis of ecological niches rather than on the historical and geographical evidence from Judah during the days of the kingdom and the Persian period. As a result, it is impossible to understand either the historical or the archaeological significance of the division he makes or to compare it with the division made here.
The Demographic Meaning of the Archaeological Data
In an attempt to give the archaeological data a demographic meaning, one must take into account a reasonable range of deviation in order to allow for the known gaps in the archaeological surveys. Some
131. Thus, for example, Carter’s conclusion (1999: 199–201) is that the total settled area during the Babylonian and Persian periods (including an error coefficient that he adds to his figures) is approximately 868 dunams (about 75% of the estimate of the total number of settled dunams given above). At the same time, the distinction he tries to make between the two different phases of the Persian period requires a manipulation of the data—injecting various error coefficients for each of the periods and adding general estimates of the size of Jerusalem at these two stages on the basis of the biblical descriptions in Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah. 132. Carter himself (1999: 199–200) acknowledges this. Based on his assumption that many sites were abandoned in the first third of the fifth century b.c.e., he decides on a lower error coefficient for the first “phase” (10%) than the one he uses for the second “phase” (20%). 133. Thus, Carter decides (I think without justification) that 25% of the sites in Benjamin existed in “Persian Period B.” Consequently, he projects this relativity onto all of the sites in Judah, while omitting from the discussion the Persian fortresses, whose date he fixes independently. It is, therefore, not clear why he determines that 41 out of 55 sites in Judah were in existence in “Persian Period A” or how he divides the total settled area on this basis.



Demographic Changes in Judah 361
scholars have added a fixed deviation of 20% to the final figures;134 other scholars have tried to estimate the amount of deviation for each region separately.135 The second method seems preferable, because it offers the option of considering the deviation, while taking into account the extent of coverage and quality of the survey, the characteristics of the area surveyed, and the characteristics of the settlement pattern that existed in each region. Likewise, one must remember that the coefficients are added to speculative evaluations and not to objective measurements; these may change periodically as the archaeological picture becomes more clear and the amount of data from each region increases. In the Benjamin region, all of the central sites have been excavated, and a comprehensive survey was conducted in most of the region. The area not yet surveyed includes primarily the western slopes of the mountain ridge, an area with almost no water resources and only a few settlement sites throughout history (Magen and Finkelstein 1993: 19–21). The estimate of settled area at the end of the Iron Age also seems quite realistic. Eighty percent of the total settled area comprised two sections: one section contained 14 settlement sites, with an area of more than 30 dunams; the second section contained 32 settlement sites, with an area greater than 10 dunams. It would be unlikely that sites of such size did not come to light in the archaeological survey; furthermore, even if some of the smaller sites were not uncovered by the survey, their overall area would be insignificant in relation to the total settled area.136 There was a scarcity of pottery finds from the Persian period in most of the sites where pottery shards of the period have been found, which attests to a lower level of activity than the activity in the same sites during the Iron Age. Thus, the estimate for this period seems to be realistic and, perhaps, even too high. In Jerusalem and its environs, the surveyors encountered great difficulty, because a large part of the survey was conducted in a built-up area. It must be assumed that the survey’s coverage was low, and the discovery of a site in this region is often casual. There were many small villages and farms surrounding the city, particularly at the end of the Iron Age, which seems to mean that a high error coefficient should be
134. See, for example, the range of deviation used by Broshi and Gophna 1984: 4142; 1986: 73–74. 135. A similar method was employed by Broshi and Finkelstein 1990; 1992; Finkelstein 1994; Ofer 1993: 2.135–37, 216–21. 136. Compare this with Finkelstein 1994: 176.



362 Oded Lipschits
added. Still, about 90% of the total settled area in this region was included within the limits of Jerusalem’s fortified walls, which is evidence that the importance of the small farms was not great within the overall estimate of the settled area in this region. The overall evaluation of settled area in the Iron Age is one of the highest given in the research, and it seems unnecessary to add any error coefficient whatsoever. The quantity of pottery in most sites from the Persian period is very small, which attests to a much lower level of activity than in parallel sites from the Iron Age. In this period, too, most of the settled area was within the city limits that are encircled by the city wall. This allows the assumption that, in this case as well, there is no need for any error coefficient. In the Judean Hills, there are great gaps in our knowledge (Ofer 1993: 2.218). About one-third of the area has not been surveyed, including large sections south of Jerusalem that may be assumed to have been settled in a relatively dense manner. However, it is unlikely that large, central sites did not come to light in the archaeological survey, and therefore, the major gaps in information must relate to the small sites in the region. It seems sufficient to add an error coefficient of 30% for both periods, which were settled with similar intensity.137 In the Shephelah, there are great gaps in our knowledge. The only publication of the data has been Dagan’s M.A. thesis, and this included less than half of the total area of the region and focused primarily on data from the Iron Age.138 However, most of the central sites in this region are well known, which is evidence that the major gap in our information relates only to the medium-sized and small sites. Likewise, Dagan’s estimates of settled area define the maximum area of each site, and his ceramic estimates are only general, which shows that we are probably overestimating the total settled area in the Shephelah. Consequently, a 30% error coefficient for the two periods seems realistic for this region.
In the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys, Jordan Valley, Judean Desert, and western littoral of the Dead Sea, almost all of the central sites have been excavated, and the conditions of the terrain and quality of surveys are evidence that most of the settlement sites that existed in these regions are well known and familiar.139 The gaps in these surveys do not ap

See the data presented by Dagan (1992) and my discussion (1997: 302–10) on their significance for the periods under discussion. 139. For an evaluation of the survey conducted in the Judean Desert, Jordan Valley, and along the western littoral of the Dead Sea, see Lipschits 2000. Regarding the survey

pear to be significant; thus, it would seem unnecessary to add any error coefficient.140 The corrected figures, including the error coefficients proposed above, are presented in table 2.141 As discussed above, the accepted density coefficient in the demographic research is an average of 25 people per settled dunam. Table 3 assesses the total population for both periods, on the basis of estimates of the settled area multiplied by the accepted coefficient. On the basis of these figures, and rounding off the numbers, we estimate that the number of inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah as it came to an end was approximately 110,000, and the population of the province of “Yehud” was approximately 30,000.
The Significance of the Demographic Assessments
These demographic assessments have great significance in our reconstruction of the historical processes that transpired in Judah between the seventh and fifth centuries b.c.e., because they allow a

conducted in the Beer-sheba–Arad Valleys, it appears that the data cited above, including those reported by Beit-Arieh (personal communication), reflect the settlement picture in the periods in question. The main question mark in this region concerns the size of the site under the city of modern-day Beer-sheba (the area of the Bedouin marketplace).

different perspective of the biblical descriptions that, until now, have served almost exclusively as a source for all historical discussions. Thus, for example, it seems that the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the kingdom of Judah brought about the gravest demographic crisis in the history of the kingdom of Judah—much more severe than that of the Sennacherib campaign (701 b.c.e.).142 The data on settlement and demography may lend support to the historical premise that most of the exiles to Babylon had been residents of Jerusalem. It is also reasonable to assume that the Babylonians dealt a major military blow to the inhabitants of the Shephelah. However, there is no evidence of a deportation from either the region of Benjamin or the northern Judean Hills. It seems that, if there was such an exile, it was limited and demographically insignificant.

142. These data do not leave any room for various theories of “the myth of the empty land” and further attest unequivocally that the destruction and exile were indeed historical events, described in their full harshness in the biblical historiography and also reflected in the lamentations and prophecies of this period.

tion of Jerusalem and throughout most of the sixth century b.c.e. Jerusalem and its environs were thoroughly razed by the Babylonians, and there is no evidence of any settlement there whatsoever until the Persian period. In contrast to the settlement picture in Jerusalem, settlement in Benjamin declined only at the beginning of the Persian period, a fact for which the archaeological data provide unequivocal evidence. It appears that settlement in this area continued unabated throughout the sixth century b.c.e., and it is even probable that population density was greater than it had been just prior to the destruction of Jerusalem. The total settled area during the sixth century b.c.e. may be estimated at approximately 1,600 dunams (a decline of about 60% when compared with the size of the settled area at the end of the Iron Age). The dwindling population in the Benjamin region at the beginning of the Persian period led to an additional drop in the size of settled area, a drop of approximately 25%; the resettling in Jerusalem is of almost no demographic significance. The evidence shows that the “return to Zion” did not leave its imprint on the archaeological data, nor is there any demographic testimony of it. At the end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries b.c.e., there was a marked dwindling of settlement (particularly in the Benjamin region), and there is no indication whatsoever of either a demographic increase or any change in settlement pattern, apart from the resettlement of Jerusalem and its environs. The demographic figures from the Jerusalem region also attest that even at the height of the Persian period, the city’s population was only 3,000, which is about 12% of the population of the city and its environs on the eve of the destruction. Even if all of the residents of the region were among the exiles who made the return to Zion, the returnees only amounted to several thousand. Thus, at the beginning of the Persian period, it is probable that a few thousand of the nation’s elite, especially of the priestly caste, returned to Judah and settled in Jerusalem and its near environs. Nonetheless, the city remained poor, and the returnees found it difficult to recruit the resources and manpower required to build the Temple. Parallel to this, with the shift of the political and religious hub to Jerusalem, a rapid dwindling in population took place in the Benjaminite region. Apparently, part of the region’s inhabitants migrated out of the province, either to the Ono-Lod area or to other parts of the Shephelah, most likely the eastern sectors.143
143. On this subject, see the detailed discussion in Lipschits 1998: 8–32.

In spite of this, the demographic figures indicate that, at the height of the Persian period, the region of Benjamin and the Judean Hills continued to serve as a habitat for most of the population of the province (75% of the total population). Less than 15% of the populace of the province lived in the Shephelah, and approximately 10% lived in Jerusalem and its environs. This demonstrates the significance of the blow that Jerusalem suffered at the hands of the Babylonians at the time of the city’s destruction and the extent to which Jerusalem’s recovery and move toward becoming a large, demographically significant urban center up to the beginning of the Hellenistic period was unsuccessful. This accords with descriptions in the book of Nehemiah, in which Jerusalem was bereft of populace. The figure given in Nehemiah, which states that the city was populated by a tenth of the province’s inhabitants (approximately 3,000 people), accords with our estimate of the total population at that time.144

The Province of Samaria (Assyrian Samerina)
in the Late Iron Age (Iron Age III)
Adam Zertal
Haifa University
Introduction
This paper is a continuation of and a bridge between my previous works about Samaria and its region in Iron Age I (Zertal 1998), Iron Age II (Zertal 2001), and the Persian period (Zertal 1989a). In those three consecutive essays, I made an effort to gather data and build an image of the northern part of the central hill country of Israel/Palestine during the Iron Age. The papers deal mainly with the areas relating to Samaria, the capital city of the territory of the same name, defined in the Bible as a part of the allotment of the tribe of Manasseh. The archaeological information about the other Assyrian territories and provinces (Mt. Ephraim, the Mediterranean Coast, the Jezreel and Beth-shean Valleys, Galilee) is less complete, a fact to be discussed below. In addition to the introductions on history, Bible, and the administrative division of the territory, I shall emphasize the pattern of settlement in the present work. This interdisciplinary field has not been explored enough, and the data were gathered during our 23-year survey of Manasseh. This project consisted of systematically combing the area of nearly 2500 sq. km between the Jezreel Valley, the Sharon Plain, the Wadi Qanah—Wadi Ahmar line, and the Jordan River (Zertal 1993a; see fig. 1 below). The survey provides us with diversified information: topography, natural factors, and settlement history. Together with the historical sources, a historical-archaeological image of the province can be formed. With the recent publication of the book by Stern (2001), supposed to sum up the research of the Late Iron Age, one could expect the first, much sought-after, thorough synthesis of the cultures of Palestine between the years 722 and 535 b.c.e. Yet large pieces of data have either been ignored by the author or, in other cases, misjudged by him. In

The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 379
addition to the central subject, I shall try to bring forth here the new information gathered in this significant area of Iron Age Israel/Palestine, information ignored in Stern’s book.
The Term Iron Age III
Since Albright’s (1945; 1953) old division into Iron Age I (ca. 12001000 b.c.e.) and II (1000–586 b.c.e.), plenty of new data has been accumulated, making necessary a modification in the division within Iron Age II.1 Many years ago Amiran and Aharoni (1958) suggested a new subdivision of IA II, according to which Iron Age III would be defined as the period from 800 to 587 b.c.e. Without entering into their argumentation here, I believe that the year 800 b.c.e. does not coincide with any of the divisions, and has barely any historical or archaeological significance. Instead, I propose to use Iron Age III in another way. From most of the chronologies and divisions of the Iron Age, which are based on history and king-lists (Andersen 1969; Clines 1974; Cogan
1. A. Mazar (1990: 368ff.) uses the terms IA, IIA (the United Monarchy, 1000–925), and IIB (Divided Monarchy, 925–587 b.c.e.), a schemata that basically corresponds to Albright’s division.

The gradual transition of the country from a vassal, half-independent Israelite state into a Mesopotamian colony changed the material culture. The next 400 years (722–332 b.c.e.) saw a continued rule of the large territories of Northern Israel by the Mesopotamian empires (Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian). In consequence, the material culture of the north differed, gradually but in a more and more defined manner, from that of the preceding period. The differences were in many components, justifying the new term Iron Age III for the period 722–535 b.c.e. These views are not completely new (Barkay 1992), yet we shall concentrate here on the data from the province of Samaria itself. The features involved can be formulated as follows:
1. a new administrative division for the provinces of Dor, Megiddo, and Samaria; 2. the rise of Samaria into the largest and most important city of Palestine; 3. the intrusion of new Mesopotamian architectural style in the official and military buildings. Domestic and other architecture remains predominantly local; 4. the intrusion of a few imported pottery types (Assyrian “palaceware,” with other small finds). Local pottery remains predominant; 5. the settlement of new ethnic groups, primarily the Samaritans; 6. the appearance of pottery decorated with Mesopotamian “cuneiform”-like signs. This seems to mark the settlement of the populaces mentioned above, exiled from Mesopotamia, Elam, and Arabia. The pattern of settlement changes accordingly.
The Historical Background
The Development of the Assyrian Province System
The history of northern Palestine in the Assyrian and Babylonian periods suffers from a lack of historical data. In fact, with the exception of the documentation that concerns the conquest of Samaria (ANET, 235–38) and the transfers of populations that followed, only scanty



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 381
information can be gathered on this subject. Assyria finally conquered the southern Levant through a series of campaigns, starting with Tiglath-pileser III, who arrived at the southern coast of Palestine and conquered the Philistine city-states (Tadmor 1990; Garelli 1991). In addition, he destroyed the kingdom of Aram Damascus (732) and conquered the Galilee (733 b.c.e.). The city of Samaria and the surrounding area, left untouched for a while by the Assyrians as a tiny vassal-state, were finally conquered in 722 b.c.e. following a three-year siege (Tadmor 1973: 69). The final liquidation of this state by Shalmaneser V and Sargon II was connected with the crushing of the revolt in Ashdod. The division into provinces (Aramaic pa ̇wah) was related to the events in Ashdod, followed by a reorganization of the newly-conquered empire. Sargon seems to have been the organizer of the new scheme of provinces, a scheme later retarded and upset by the revolt led by Hezekiah of Judah and Sadqa of Ashqelon. The Assyrian king Sennacherib (705681 b.c.e.) came to crush the Judahite rebel in 701, but the results of his campaign are controversial (Tadmor 1958; Ephoal 1982: 192–93; Naaaman 1991b). The demise of this rebel, though presented as Hezekiah’s victory described in 2 Kings 18–19, in effect stabilized the Assyrian rule in the provinces, and the pa ̇wah-system remained more or less unchanged, as far as we know, for the next 400 years. The rules of Esarhaddon (681–668) and his son Ashurbanipal (668–627 b.c.e.) involved the country in perpetual conflict between Egypt of the Late Kingdom and Assyria (Oates 1965; Naaaman 1979; 1991a; 1991b). An interesting innovative view of the development of the Assyrian Empire has been suggested by Liverani (1979; 1988). According to his research in the Habur region and the Middle Euphrates, the Assyrian Empire was not created simply by quick conquest of large territories but, rather, by “implanting” Assyrian “islands” within the newly-conquered countries. The process continued with the large-scale transfer of exiled populations and transplanting them around those islands, which were actually military forts. In many respects Liverani’s ideas may well explain the development of the province under discussion, and they also coincide with the newly discovered forts, administrative centers, and areas settled by exiled populaces.
The Administrative Division of the Assyrian Territories
Of the three kinds of units (provinces, vassal states, and nomadic tribes), I am dealing only with the province of Samaria. Administratively, the Assyrian provinces replaced the former independent states of the Levant. A governor (Assyrian bel pihati or saknu; for this title, see



382 Adam Zertal
Henshaw 1967–68) was appointed head of each province/pihatu, and the conquered populaces became Assyrian citizens. In the region of Samaria, other titles such as rab alani (‘district governor’, Fisher and Lyon 1924: 247; Saggs 1963: 243ff.) and hazannu (‘city governor’, Johns 1912: 25) are mentioned. As part of the new organization, the Assyrians changed the social and ethnic structure of the provinces through large-scale replacements of populations (Oded 1979; Parker 1997: 8485; Ephoal 1991). In the region of Samaria this process created a new populace—the Samaritans.

Forrer (1920) was the first (see also Alt 1929) to show the existence of three Assyrian pihati in Transjordan (Horan, Gilead, and Qarnaim) and another three in western Israel (Megiddo, Dor, and Samaria—fig. 4). Despite the lack of historical material and the several contradictions in the Assyrian texts themselves (Ephoal 1982: 197), Forrer’s division is still the least controversial and the best evaluation of the data. The controversy over the existence of the province of Dor came to an end only with the appearance of this name in a newly discovered list of the Assyrian provinces published by Fales and Postgate (Stern 2001: 12). The boundaries of the province of Samaria seem to originate, in my view, from the old Israelite tribal division—the hill country allotment of Manasseh, followed by the third Solomonic district (1 Kgs 4:10; Albright 1931; Zertal 1984; 1992b; 1992c; see fig. 4). Judging by the other provinces’ boundaries, it seems that the governor of Samaria had under his jurisdiction only the area of the hill country, bordered by the Jezreel Valley (north), the Jordan River (east), the Coastal Plain (west) and the Jericho–Naßbeh–Eqron line (Aharoni 1979: map 31).
The Biblical Evidence
This material, presented in 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, and the prophetic books, is largely concerned with the events and situation in Judah. Only a few pieces of information relate directly to the Northern territories, ruled by the Assyrians and the Babylonians. These concern, to a large extent, the Samaritans and their crystallization in the eighth through seventh centuries b.c.e. It also reminds the reader of the existence of the large Israelite groups who remained in the area of the former kingdom of Israel. The origin of the Samaritans is one of the principal controversial issues in the Second Temple literature. While the Samaritans themselves trace their origin directly to the Northern Israelites, others (Josephus, Ben Sira [Purvis 1965], and the Talmudic literature; and see Talmon 1973: 20–22) adopt the biblical attitude, namely, that the Samaritans originated from the newcomers brought by the Assyrians. This debate is the product of the scanty and laconic biblical description in 2 Kings 17–18. According to Talmon (1973: 24–26), Cogan (1978), and Oded (1987), the literary description of 2 Kings 17–18 is not an original part of the sequence of the 2 Kings narratives. This material was transplanted into the story for historiosophic reasons. This perspective is based on the difference between the two stories about the fall of Samaria (2 Kgs 17:5



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 385
6; 18:9–11). The lack of synchronistic data at the beginning of 2 Kings 17 is additional evidence for its not being an original part and for the whole story’s having been added by a Judahite writer, presumably during the Persian period (2 Kgs 17:26–27). At the same time, the historical basis of the story should not be rejected. This unclear situation presents the following problems, already raised by Talmon (1973: 24):
• What were the political situation and the socioeconomic conditions of the Israelite population left in Samaria after the Assyrian conquest? • What were the number, origin, and settlement areas of the newcomers?
More than a generation after these problems were raised, they can be answered with some certainty. Based on the archaeological evidence, some new understandings of the Samaritans’ origin can be offered. The biblical story moves away from the Northern Israelites to Judah (2 Kings 18–21) after the fall of Samaria (2 Kgs 17:5–6); it is only with Josiah’s reforms, dated from 609 b.c.e. on, that the Israelites from “Ephraim and Manasseh to Zebulun” (2 Chr 30:10), are mentioned in the biblical account. The Northern Israelites are mentioned again in Jer 41:5: “and people came from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria—eighty persons, their faces shaved and their clothes torn.” The fact that organized communities of Israelites still saw Jerusalem as their holy place may be interpreted as evidence of the existence of the Yahwistic cult as the main faith in the North, some 150 years after the conquest of Samaria. It may also indicate the victory of this cult over the imported Mesopotamian idols, as evinced by 2 Kgs 17:24–41. The archaeological data seem to support this idea, that in spite of the population changes, most of the people remained Israelite in faith. Even if the number of exiled people from Samaria by the Assyrians (approximately 27,000) is reliable, it still did not exceed 20–25% of the Israelite population. The estimated eighth-century b.c.e. Israelite population has been 50,000 (Zertal 1989a: 14). This figure has grown now with the development of the survey and the discovery of many new sites, and we now estimate 60–70,000 persons. Therefore, the overwhelming majority of the Israelite population should be seen as stable. In the text dealing with the number and settlement areas of the newcomers, the short description of the fall of Samaria in 2 Kgs 17:5–6 is followed by a long explanation about the religious reasons for this fall (vv. 7–23) and additional phrases about the kutîm (Cuthaeans) brought by the Assyrians from the Mesopotamian area (vv. 24–41). The



386 Adam Zertal
new archaeological data concerning this problem is discussed in “The Archaeological Evidence,” below. Only a few hints or none at all are to be found about the Babylonian period in Samaria in the biblical narratives.
The Archaeological Evidence
Architecture
Mesopotamian influence on architecture in Samaria is seen primarily in the building of complexes similar to first-millenium b.c.e. Assyrian structures. The basic features of Assyrian architecture have been analyzed by Loud (1936) and Turner (1970), with additions by Reich (1979) and Heinrich (1984). Reich (1992: 214) defines royal Assyrian architecture as “distinguished by a series of architectural conventions, uniform ground plans and characteristic building materials and architectural elements.” The discovery of Assyrian-type building in ancient Hazor was analyzed by Amiran and Dunayevski (1958). The Assyrian city (Stratum III) of Megiddo was built in the same style. As Shiloh (1993: 1023) states: “Megiddo became the center of the new Assyrian province. It was built on an entirely new, orthogonal city plan, quite uncommon in Palestine up to that time. . . . The Assyrian style is particularly evident in two large public buildings (nos. 1052, 1369—fig. 2), built near the city gate according to similar plans: a large, spacious central courtyard, surrounded on all sides by halls and rooms.” This imported architecture is seen also in other areas of the site (Holladay 1997: 110). In some cases, there are projections from the walls into the open spaces, presumably the remains of Mesopotamian brick architecture (Stone 1981). In spite of the above statements, Stern’s (2001: 18–19) statements, such as “the Assyrians’ impact on every aspect of Palestine’s culture may be regarded as revolutionary,” seem to be much exaggerated. In most aspects, life in Iron Age Palestine seems to have continued without much change, as far as daily life is concerned. The new architecture seems to have appeared mainly in the new administrative and military posts. Together with the excavations, surveys of several sites in the territory of ancient Manasseh, published in three volumes (Zertal 1992; 1996; Zertal and Mirkam 2000), seem to indicate the presence of a system of Mesopotamian-like centers. If they have been defined accurately, they help our understanding of the organization of the Assyrian/Babylonian province. The centers are divided into administrative complexes and military forts and camps.



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 387
Administrative Complexes
Literary evidence for the Assyrian administration includes a letter from Nimrud (NL 67 = ND 2666), first published by Saggs in 1963 and later republished by Parker (1997: 78–81). Parker’s (1997: 77) introduction to the letter should be quoted here:
It is clear from the royal correspondence of the Assyrian empire . . . that the construction of forts was an integral part of the permanent establishment of Assyrian sovereignty in newly conquered regions. Forts served as garrison outposts in formerly hostile areas and were therefore the first footholds of Assyrian expansion into recently annexed territories. They were military centres, from which campaigns and intelligence operations

388 Adam Zertal
were conducted into and beyond the frontier, administrative centres where the daily affairs of the surrounding areas were directed and monitored, and communications hubs through which news and information were channeled. In addition to these roles, forts or garrison centres also served as conduits through which the Assyrian ideology of imperialism could be diffused into the periphery of the empire and the process of acculturation of the “foreign” inhabitants of peripheral zones could be conducted.
At least three such complexes were explored in our survey. They were identified by their architectural similarity to the Assyrian courtyardhouse type, by their pottery, and by their distribution on the area.
Fig. 6. Plan of Jellamet Wusta.



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 389
Accordingly, an administrative division of the region of Samaria can be proposed: 1. Kh. Merajjim. The site (see figs. 3, 5 above—Israel grid 1744/1935; Zertal 1992: no. 119) is located on a saddle of the high Jebel Hureish, in the central Shechem syncline, some 10 km north of the city of Samaria
Fig. 7. Plan of the Complex of Umm Qatan.



390 Adam Zertal
(fig. 5). The six-dunam (6,000 sq. m) site consists of a large central courtyard surrounded by rooms, with two or three other smaller courtyards arranged in the same pattern. Although most of the pottery dates to the Persian period, it seems reasonable to presume that this style was inherited from the former Assyrian or Babylonian period. 2. Jellamet Wusta (figs. 5, 6—Israel grid 1824/1924; Zertal 1992: no. 152) is located in the eastern part of the territory under discussion, some 15 km northeast of Samaria and 3 km west of the village of Tubas. The site was built on a plateau surrounded by plains. Here, too, the similarity to buildings 1052 and 1369 in Megiddo Stratum III is prominent. The eight-dunam site is well planned. It consists of two or three courtyards surrounded by many rooms, and each unit is built along the same pattern. About half of the pottery here belongs to Iron Age III (ca. 722–535 b.c.e.), and the other half is Persian. Thus, the life-span of the site could have been 300 years (from the eighth to the fourth century b.c.e.). As with site no. 1, the setting of this site hints at an administrative center. 3. Kh. Umm Qatan (fig. 5, 7 above—Israel grid 1947/1841; Zertal 1996: no. 133) is located on the fringes of the desert, at the center of the large inner valley of Buqeioah (fig. 5). It stands on a low hillock and covers an area of three dunams. Unlike the other sites, the architecture of Kh. Umm Qatan was greatly disturbed in later periods (Byzantine, Early Moslem, and Middle Ages). In spite of the difficulty of tracing the original building, dating to Iron Age III (represented by 50% of the surface pottery counted), its original plan seems clear. In the plan (fig. 7) the black lines represent the presumed IAIII walls, similar to the other sites above: a large enclosed complex, with inner courtyards surrounded by rooms and halls. Kh. Umm Qatan stands at a natural crossroads (fig. 5) of the road coming from the north (C23) and the one coming from the northwest (C19–C21) that goes along the Buqeioah. As such, it may also have been an administrative center for the Buqeioah and its environs. What may the function of these centers (and the forts) have been? From the Nimrud letter and other sources (Parker 1997: 79), we can determine that the role of the centers was multipurpose: they were used as supply or equipment centers, as communication centers and posts for troop movement, as centers for enemy prisoners, and as control posts for the shipment of raw material (the letter discusses in detail the use of bitumen and the shipment of logs, though these are more typical of the northern provinces, near the Euphrates; Parker 1997: 80–84). All these roles, and others, may be connected to our newly-discovered centers.

Military Posts and/or Fortresses
This section describes the military camp near the Sanur Valley and the fortress near the Sartaba Massif (Kh. Meras ed-Din). Both belong to military installations that can be related to one of the Mesopotamian regimes—most likely the Assyrian—and that continued to be used during the Babylonian and Persian periods. Their relevance to the Assyrians is in the architectural similarity and the Iron Age III pottery, in addition to the literature published.
Fig. 9. Plan of the Camp at el-Qaoadeh.



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 393
4. The el-Qaoadeh Camp (Israel Grid 1789/1916; Zertal 1992: site no. 154; Zertal 1993b: figs. 9–10) is situated within a natural park of evergreen oak, south of Sanur Valley and on the road between it and Tell el-Faroah (Tirzah). It is located some 12 km northeast of Samaria (fig. 5). The camp of el-Qaoadeh is a large, square (ca. 70 x 70 m) site surrounded by a wide wall containing rooms and halls (fig. 9). The camp was administered from these rooms. In addition, two similar rows of rooms penetrate the interior of the camp from its northern wall. The camp is entered through a gate protected by an outer wall, which is a reminiscent of the Roman clavicula. The area enclosed by courtyards outside the western wall of the camp, with the main cistern in its center, was probably a service area (for cooking, and so on). The empty space of the inner area is a typical feature of military camps, unlike Iron Age II forts, which were smaller in area and fully built-up inside (Arad, Qadesh Barnea, oUza, Óorvat Rosh Zayit, Abu et-Tuwein, and others). The pottery (collected along the surrounding walls) comes from the Iron Age II (5%), IAIII (20%), Persian (70%), and Hellenistic (5%) periods. In addition, an Assyrian-type iron arrowhead was found. The pottery division points to a longevity of the camp, which

394 Adam Zertal
was probably founded in Late Iron Age II (end of eighth century b.c.e.?) and lasted until the Hellenistic period. A prominent feature of this unique camp is its similarity to the Assyrian military camps depicted in the reliefs of the Sargonid kings of Assyria. These reliefs appear to provide basic evidence on how the camps looked: a camp was a space surrounded by walls and occupied by horses, chariots, and soldiers doing various jobs. It had an entrance crowned by towers but no entrance protected by a wall, as ours does. Camps of this style are depicted on the bronze gates at Balawat (ImgurBell—see Unger 1912; King 1915) and the relief from Nineveh showing the siege of Lachish (Ussishkin 1982: fig. 73). Our camp is similar to the Assyrian camps in plan, shape, and period. In all the Mesopotamian (Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian) empires, no such camp has been found archaeologically, perhaps due to the fact that they were mostly made of wood. If indeed an Assyrian (or Babylonian/Persian) camp is dealt with here, this rare example was preserved due to its remote location and its stone construction.

The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 395
Nimrud letter NL 67, mentioned above, was written to the king by the fort commander, a certain Duri-Assur, the eponym of the governor of the city of Tushan (728 b.c.e.), most likely in the days of Tiglathpileser III (Parker 1997: 81). The text reveals that an important part of the fort, and the first to be built, was the defensive wall. The fort had a central courtyard (ki-sa-lu(?)—Parker 1997: 82, line 17) and a main water cistern (ia-ar-hu sa gi-da-ni, line rev. 4—1997: 80), located outside the main body of the fort. This arrangement coincides with the elQaoadeh camp. Other details (barracks, wooden doors, yards plastered by asphalt, drainage system, commander residence, and so on) may be better understood against the “Northern” background of the letter. If indeed Assyrian, the camp could have been involved in the siege of neighboring Samaria in 722/723 b.c.e.
5. The Fortress (?) of Kh. Meras ed-Din (Israel grid 1862/1675: figs. 5, 8) is a complex of buildings of the same Mesopotamian style. The elongated hill upon which the fortress is located, some 100 dunams in area, was surrounded by a fortifying wall (not preserved on the western and southern sides). The length of this wall was some 400 m, with a possible entrance near the northeastern corner. The site consists of three smaller forts: the southern fort was a building of two courtyards surrounded by rooms; the northern fort has two large courtyards, surrounded by walls composed of large boulders. Some of the rooms around have disappeared, but their remains point to the same basic plan. The small western complex consists of a single courtyard with rooms in its western wall. Complexes similar to Meras ed-Din, protected by a surrounding wall, have a long tradition in Mesopotamia, such as the great temenos (sacred enclosure) of Ur from the end of the third millenium b.c.e. (Lloyd 1978: fig. 57). Yet the best parallels come from the Assyrian world: these are the fortified citadel from Sargon II’s palace at Dur Sharrukin (Khorsabad—Lloyd 1978: fig. 143 [fig. 11 here]) and the citadel mound at Nimrud (Lloyd 1978: fig. 140). In both cases, the hill on which the complex stands was surrounded by a fortifying wall, within which complexes of courtyards surrounded by rooms were located.
Pottery
The pottery of the Late Iron Age in northern Palestine has been analyzed by various scholars, mainly relating to excavations in the area discussed: Samaria-Sebaste (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957), Tell el-Faroah (N) (Chambon 1984), and Shechem-Balâtah (Holladay 1966). To these should be added the excavations at Hazor (Yadin et al.

The Main Pottery Types of the Province of Samaria in the Assyrian-Babylonian Period (Eighth–Sixth Centuries b.c.e.): 1. wedge-decorated bowl (from Tell el-Faroah [N]); 2. carinated bowl with wide-ledge rim; 3. a jar with ridge on the neck; 4. hole-mouth jar with wide rim; 5. gray Assyrian carinated bowl.

1955–61) and Megiddo (Megiddo I). Contrary to Stern’s (2001: 36–37) classifications, most of the Iron Age III ceramic inventory remained local and continued from the eighth into the seventh/sixth centuries, with some modifications and additions. The Assyrian influence is expressed by the addition of a few imported vessels (“palace-ware”), which appear in small quantities; the only addition of a new style into the dominant local repertory seems to have been the wedge-decorated bowls. Following are the most typical styles and vessels of the area of Samaria in the seventh/sixth centuries b.c.e., based on the excavations and survey in Shechem, Samaria, and Tirzah:
The Wedge-Decorated Bowl (Fig. 12:1)
This bowl (Zertal 1989b) can now be considered a good indicator of the period. Its special decoration, made in a cuneiform pattern, was first discovered in the early digs of the hill country: the 1908–10 Harvard excavations of Samaria-Sebaste (Reisner, Fisher, and Lyon 1924: fig. 162:14a), and Tell en-Naßbeh (Wampler 1947: pl. 63: 1454; 88: 3 and pp. 39, 174). It was also presented in the reports of Tell el-Faroah (N) (Chambon 1984: pl. 56: 19, 21–22) and Tell es-Saoidiyeh in the Jordan Valley (Pritchard 1985: 41 and fig. 16:14); but its similarity to the Mesopotamian decoration was recognized later, and its distribution in the territory of Samaria emerged with the development of the Manasseh survey. The main points concerning the vessel are as follows:
1. The bowl itself (rounded bowl with ledge-rim, below) is local in origin. Its chronology coincides with the periods of the Assyrian and Babylonian rules—that is, approximately 720–535 b.c.e. It does not appear before the fall of Samaria, nor is it present in the fifth century b.c.e. Its appearance in the sixth century is also not prominent. 2. The special decoration originated in the Euphrates Valley, as far back as the fourth millenium b.c.e. Specimens similar to ours, dated to the first millenium b.c.e., were found in the Habur Valley, in Kish, in the survey of Uruk-Warka, Nippur, and other places (Zertal 1989b: 80–82). 3. The combination of the Mesopotamian elements with a local bowl may connect the appearance of the vessel in Samaria with the arrival of the populaces brought by the Assyrian kings from southern Mesopotamia, from Arabia, and from Elam (Tadmor 1973: 71; Deshayes 1969: 121, 167, 609; Oded 1979: 75–115). This definition makes it possible to follow their pattern of settlement; see below.



398 Adam Zertal
The following vessels are all local:
Rounded Bowl with Ledge-Rim (Fig. 12:2)
This vessel, decorated by Mesopotamian wedges, is a large, deep bowl, 30–40 cm in diameter. It has a medium ring base and a thick, rounded ledge-rim, protruding outward and inward. In some cases the bowl is carinated or, rarely, red slipped (Chambon 1984: pl. 56: 17). The bowl is very common in the period discussed, as in the “chronological horizon,” 733–722 b.c.e., in Tell Balâtah–Shechem (Holladay 1966: fig. 32: A–O); in Samaria-Sebaste period VI (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 7: 1; 13: 16–18); in Megiddo Strata I–V (Lamon and Shipton 1939: pl. 25:62); and in Faroah (N) Strata VIIe–VIId (Chambon 1984: pl. 56: 9–20).
Jar with a Ridge on the Neck (Fig. 12:3)
Jars with a ridge on the neck were the main storage jars of Late Iron Age II and Iron Age III in the Samaria region and can also be used to date the seventh through sixth centuries b.c.e. This type of jar was a medium-sized jar with a capacity of 20–30 litres, two handles on its shoulder, and a neck with a ridge on it. The rim is thickened; on earlier specimens (ninth–eighth centuries—Hazor II, pl. 60: 6; Zimhoni 1997: fig. 2.11: 4) the rim was rounded, whereas later ones had a sharpened rim, inclined outwards. Along with the other vessels, this type dates the period discussed (for parallels, see Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 11: 24; Chambon 1984: fig. 45: 6; and Holladay 1966: fig. 80: A–M).
Wide-Rimmed, Hole-Mouth Jar (Fig. 12:4)
This vessel, like the other ones, has a long history of development. In the ninth/eighth centuries it had a wide mouth with a thickened rim, whereas in the later periods a wide, plate-like rim was developed (Crowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon 1957: fig. 11: 29–30; Chambon 1984: fig. 45: 20; Holladay 1966: fig. 88: A–C).
Assyrian Wares (Fig. 12:5)
Petrie (1928: 7 and 23, pls. 48, 65) was the first to recognize the carinated bowls as being imported from Assyria. Amiran (1969: 291 and pl. 99) displayed the various Assyrian wares imported to Israel/Palestine. She included in the repertory the special bottle from SamariaSebaste (Amiran 1969: pl. 99:6) and, reservedly, the jar (1969: pl. 99:7). The thin, carinated, gray bowl, attested to in some of the excavated sites in the Samaria region, reached as far north as Hazor. It was also found in some of our survey sites.



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 399
The Assyrian wares are evidence of trade between the pa ̇wah of Samaria and Assyria and, at the same time, possible evidence for the presence of Assyrians in Samaria. They can also, together with the other vessels, date the repertories to the seventh/sixth centuries.
Other Finds: Assyrian and Babylonian Cuneiform Inscriptions, Tablets, and Seals
A series of Assyrian and Babylonian cuneiform inscriptions, tablets, seals, and other items found in the region of Samaria and beyond, shed some light on the administration and, in a limited matter, on the history of the territory. However, these finds are few, considering the long period in which Samaria was under these regimes. Of the four pieces of monumental Assyrian inscriptions discovered in Israel, one was found in Ashdod and the other three in the Samaria region: one in the city of Samaria itself, and the others in Tel Hadid and Qaqun. The first three are related to Sargon II, and the fourth from Qaqun—probably to Esarhaddon (Stern 2001: 14–15). Of the few Assyrian cuneiform clay tablets found, the one from Samaria with the rab alani title deserves mention (Henshaw 1968: 478). In Gezer, some 65 km southwest of Samaria, two Assyrian sale contracts, dated to 649 and 651 b.c.e., were discovered (Galling 1968: 81–82; Reich and Brandl 1985). In Tel Hadid, not far from Gezer, a complete Assyrian legal document was recently unearthed, dating between 701 and 689 b.c.e.; it contains Babylonian and Aramaic names, probably relating to deportees brought into the country (Stern 2001: 16). As for seals, as justly noted by Geva (1981: 298–99), no local imitations of the Assyrian “imperial” style in glyptics are known. In Samaria, seals commemorating the names of Assyrian rab-saknu and bel pihati (governors) were found (Grayson 1963: 126, 126; Postgate 1970: 148). R. A. S. Macalister (1907: 130 and pl. 9) published a cylinder seal from Beth-shean, depicting a Neo-Assyrian scene; and other seals and seal-stamps are known as well. As for Babylonian rule, the two tablets found so far add nothing to the Samaria area (Stern 2001: 332). Apart from the cylinder seal from Samaria with the name of the scribe Nabu Zabil, only one tablet was found (see below). In addition, other nonepigraphic Babylonian seals (mainly conical by shape) are known from all over the country, all of them related to Persian stratigraphical contexts. Their small number may attest to the short period of the Babylonian rule and its limited influence (Stern 2001: 335).

Pattern of Settlement
Use of the term Iron Age III and its defining elements has made it possible to follow the pattern of settlement of the seventh/sixth centuries b.c.e. in the Samaria region. This we will discuss in two sections: destruction levels and the settlement of the Mesopotamian exiles.
Destruction Levels Dated to the Assyrian Conquest
Unlike the villages and farmsteads, most, if not all, of the fortified towns in the region continued to exist after the 722 b.c.e. conquest. Strata dated to the seventh–sixth centuries b.c.e. are found in SamariaSebaste periods VII–VIII, Tell el-Faroah (N; Strata VIIe–e1; Chambon 1984: 47–48), Shechem-Balâtah (Campbell 1993: 1352–53), Kh. el-Óammam (Arruboth-Narbata, personal communication; see Zertal 1992b; 1995), and Taanach Stratum V (700–650 b.c.e.—Rast 1978: 42–44). In Samaria, the British Joint Expedition did not find clear evidence of Assyrian destruction (Kenyon 1966: 110–12), a fact relating either to peaceful occupation or to the massive leveling activities later on. In Tell el-Faroah (N), Stratum VIId was destroyed, most likely by the Assyrians, but the town was rapidly reconstructed. The building plans kept the lines of Stratum VIId, and only minor modifications were found. The principal change was in the pottery, as new types of vessels appeared. At Balâtah-Shechem Stratum VII (Assyrian occupation, seventh century b.c.e.) was destroyed, and the stratum above shows “limited occupation” (Campbell 1993: 1352–53). At places such as Tel oAmal (Edelstein and Feig 1993), Shiloh (Finkelstein 1993: 389), and other villages, no destruction layers were attested. No doubt, several of the main cities were fully or partly destroyed, but it seems that most of the rural settlements were left intact. In none of these sites can traces of the short Babylonian period be identified.
Settlement of the New Populaces Brought by the Assyrians
According to our views, the distinction between Iron Age II and III (Zertal 1992: 54–56; 1996: 84–86; Zertal and Mirkam 2001: 48) enabled us to follow the settlement of the newcomers. Unfortunately, this distinction appears neither in the survey of Ephraim (Finkelstein and Lederman 1997) nor in the neighboring surveys, of Beth-shean (Zori 1962) and the Valley of Jezreel (Zori 1977; Raban 1983).2

The most prominent feature of Iron Age III is the sharp decline in the number of sites, as shown in figs. 11–12 and table 1. Within a few decades the number of sites declined by 68% or, another words, only one site was left out of three. Even if we consider a

margin of error due to the inaccuracy of pottery identification, these figures are impressive. We tend to see the main reasons for this crisis in the large deportations by the Assyrians. In spite of the figure of 27,290 persons deported from Samaria given by Sargon II (ANET, 284), it seems from the survey that these numbers could indeed have been a little larger. This view is also supported by the fact that there were three “waves” of exile, by Sargon II, Sennacherib, and Ashurbanipal (Zertal 1989b: 81–83). There must have been a certain amount of proportion between the figures of the deportations and the imported populations. Nevertheless, the new populace influenced the later Israelite policy and religion only a little, as is apparent from 2 Kgs 17:24–41.

The mass deportations seems to have influenced primarily the eastern valleys (Zebabdeh and Tubas) and the fringes of the desert, between Shechem, Tirzah, Dothan, and the Jordan River. The aridity of the region has always been the main factor affecting settlement in the area: while in Iron Age II many small family farmsteads seem to have filled the 1,200 sq. km territory (Zertal 2001: 45–49 and fig. 2.3 [fig. 14 here]), only a few of these remained into the IAIII period (fig. 15). On the other hand, we have a concentration of IAIII sites (that is, bearing an especially large number of surface-found, wedge-decorated bowls) in the eastern valleys and in the triangle between Shechem, Tell elFaroah (N—Tirzah), and Samaria (Zertal 1989b: fig. 2 [fig. 13 here]). Though much prudence is needed here, I tend to interpret this concentration as being due to the settling of newcomers in sites founded (or, in some cases, resettled) by the Assyrian authorities. If this is true, the conquerors chose to settle the exiles in special villages and not to mix the two populaces, Israelites and Cuthaeans. True, none of these sites has been excavated, but they differ on several accounts from the “regular” settlements of the area:
1. most of the pottery is dated to the IAIII period; 2. wedge-decorated bowls are present in large quantities; 3. in many settlements, where building plans can be delineated, the buildings are also “Mesopotamian” in character (sites 56, 142, 219, 224, 237–40, and 250 in Zertal 1992; and sites 12, 18, 82, 127, 132, 144, 197, 236 and 246 in Zertal 1996).
Only future excavation will fully reveal the material culture of the newcomers.
The Neo-Babylonian Interlude
The victory in 605 b.c.e. of the Neo-Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II (605–562 b.c.e.) over the Egyptian army in Carchemish, also echoed in Jer 46:2, was a crucial event in the history of the region. The government in the Levant was transferred from the deteriorating Assyrian Empire into the hands of the Chaldeans. The revolt of the Judahite king Jehoiakim (604 b.c.e.) was crushed by Nebuchadnezzar; and the results of the new revolt against Babylon, declared by Zedekiah (597–586 b.c.e.), were tragic: Jerusalem was conquered and destroyed by the Babylonian army. Along with the end of the city and the half-independent, tiny kingdom of Judah, came the destruction of the First Temple (586 b.c.e.) and the exile of the lower classes of Judah to Babylon.



The Province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age 405
The extreme lack of information on the northern part of the country in this short period is a serious obstacle to any historical reconstruction. No accurate data exist regarding the administrative division by the Babylonians. The Assyrian provinces of Transjordan and Syria mentioned in Ezek 47:15–18—Hammath, Damascus, and Gilead—seem to hint that the Babylonians did not alter the former provincial system. From the archaeological point of view, the material culture of this period also seems to have changed but little from the Assyrian period. Several strata and finds belong to the time of Babylonian rule: there are only a few remains from that period at Samaria, among which was a cuneiform tablet written in the Babylonian language and sent to the local governor Abi-Ahi and the Nabu Zabil cylinder seal. Stratum II at Megiddo, dated 650–600 b.c.e. and related to the time of Josiah, is probably out of context; but the date of its end should presumably be lowered. The city wall ceased to exist in this stratum, as did the open-court “Assyrian” buildings. The large building in Stratum II, built in the southeastern corner of the tell (Area C), was clearly erected on top of the preceding city wall. The lack of small finds in this building has prevented dating it accurately. In any case, the traditional dating of Stratum II means that Megiddo has no Babylonian stratum. The same is true for Hazor, where Stratum III is Assyrian and Stratum II is Persian (Yadin 1993: 603), and for Tell el-Faroah (N), where in Stratum VIIe1, which is dated to the sixth through fifth centuries b.c.e., only “squatters” are attested; pottery of IAII and the Persian period is attested by Chambon (1984: 12).
Conclusion
An overview of the province of Samaria in the Late Iron Age (IAIII) reveals some new features. This territory is located near the southwestern edge of the Mesopotamian empires. In comparison with other areas closer to Assyria and Babylonia, Mesopotamian rule left only limited traces here. The boundaries of the province continued under the old Israelite border system (tribal and district) with few changes. The Assyrian conquerors seemed to destroy only some of the larger cities, whereas most of the towns and villages were left intact. Their occupation was a gradual process of population change, settlement, and partial destruction, as suggested by Liverani (contra Stern 2001: 18–20). During the Assyrian rule, a system of military posts and centers was established as a basis for the new subdivision of the province. These

were built in the new style and were concentrated mainly in the midst of settlements of the deportees (eastern Samaria). The Mesopotamian influence is recognizable by the introduction of Assyrian city planning and architecture in the military and administrative centers. This type of architecture is characterized by an open-court building surrounded by rooms. Other material culture, such as pottery and so on, remained basically local. The main impact of the new rule was the deportation of sections of the Israelite population. During this process, parts of the eastern area of Samaria were emptied and then replaced by the new Cuthaeans. The wedge-shaped decoration of local IAIII bowls, a design that originated in Mesopotamia, has been used to trace the settlement areas of the new populaces. The new pattern of settlement is manifested in the eastern valleys and the fringes of the desert, where the people brought by the Assyrians were settled. This new wave of settlement followed the abandonment of the Iron Age II sites. Following building activities and population replacement, the province of Samaria became the base for Assyrian and Babylonian rule in Palestine, with the city of Samaria being the capital of the whole country. The population continued to be mainly Israelite, worshiping Yahweh. The short Babylonian rule, approximately fifty years, left few traces in the province, if any. Most of these features continued, with few changes, into the Persian period.

Tell en-Naßbeh and the Problem of the
Material Culture of the Sixth Century
Jeffrey R. Zorn
Cornell University
When I first began looking at the material from Tell en-Naßbeh fifteen years ago, an international conference on the sixth century or Babylonian period would have been an almost unheard-of event. At that time we had bits and pieces of material scattered over many sites and publications. Stern’s volume (1982) on the Persian period was the only available synthetic treatment to include the sixth century, but of course it canvassed material from subsequent centuries as well. It is gratifying indeed that a variety of important works discussing this period have appeared since that time, including Stern’s new Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, vol. 2: The Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian Periods (732–332 b.c.e.) (Stern 2001). After the destruction of Jerusalem in 586, the Babylonian appointed ruler Gedaliah established his administrative center at Mizpah (Jer 40:5–6). There he was joined by the prophet Jeremiah, eunuchs, Babylonian soldiers, Judean soldiers and officers still in the field, and the “king’s daughters”/princesses (Jer 40:7–8; 41:3, 10, 16; 43:6). Judeans who had fled to surrounding lands returned to the area around Mizpah (Jer 40:11–12). Apparently the initial stages of this local restoration of civic life went well. Soon, however, Gedaliah was murdered by a disaffected member of the Davidic line, aided and abetted by the king of the Ammonites (Jer 41:1–2). After this crime, most of those caught up in the incident, fearing a Babylonian reprisal, fled to Egypt. Nothing more is heard of Mizpah until the time of Nehemiah, when work detachments from Mizpah, at this time a district capital within Judah, helped in the reconstruction of the walls of Jerusalem (Jer 43:1–7). This much is what we know of the history of Mizpah in the sixth and fifth centuries. Tell en-Naßbeh, accepted by most as biblical Mizpah of Benjamin1 (fig. 1), just 12 km north of Jerusalem, is a prime example of what we

can and cannot learn about the archaeology of the little-known period following the Babylonian destruction and also the problems we face in its investigation. Tell en-Naßbeh (fig. 2) was excavated over the course of five seasons, between 1926 and 1935, by William F. Badè of the Pacific School of Religion (Zorn 1988; TN I.3–11). Approximately two-thirds of the site was excavated down to bedrock, providing one of our best examples of settlement organization in Iron Age Israel. However, the excavation and recording methods were children of their time. While not up to the standards of Megiddo and Tell Beit Mirsim, they were superior to those at Beth-shean and Beth-shemesh (Zorn 1999: 61–63). Large blocks of contiguous architecture were uncovered. These coherent architectural units, apparent on the unpublished 1:100 site plans, allowed me to arrive at a significant reappraisal of the site’s stratigraphy, which showed that there was a clear, distinct architectural phase that postdated the main Iron Age ring-road phase. I have posited that this stratum belongs to a period spanning the Babylonian exile down to the latter part of the Persian period, from the early sixth century to late fifth century.2 The key problem at Tell en-Naßbeh, which is also an issue at other sites thought to contain sixth-century material, is finding clean deposits that can be used to characterize this period (Zorn 1993c: 70–81;

Iron I and sixth-century material, which any site equated with Mizpah must possess to be considered a serious candidate for such an indentification.

1999: 62–63). There are two primary reasons for this: one methodological, the other a consequence of history. First, loci, such as they were, consisted of all of the contents of a fill bounded by at least three walls down to a floor, threshold, or the base of the walls (Badè 1934: 16–18, 40–41). The digging was also untidy, meaning that pure dirt loci, such as pits, would have been missed, and floors, unless made of stone, would usually be missed as well. This combination of methods means that unless obviously in situ artifact assemblages were found on a plain dirt floor the laborers would have gone completely through such a floor, mixing material from above and below floor level, and mixing in material from unidentified deposits such as pits. On the basis of a comparative analysis of sherd material recovered from these undifferentiated fills, and the contents of tombs, with stratigraphically secure deposits from other sites, it is possible to see that Tell en-Naßbeh was inhabited throughout the Iron Age. However, for reasons discussed below, Tell en-Naßbeh is sorely lacking in in situ deposits. Only two houses were uncovered that can unequivocally be said to contain such material, Buildings 110.01 and 125.01.3 This makes it impossible to characterize in broad terms the artifactual assemblages from the final phase of any of the Naßbeh strata. That is, while we may be able to date the strata broadly, it is impossible to say which vessel forms were in use at what times within and between these strata. I can show that Stratum 2 belongs, in part, to the Babylonian period, but I cannot provide a clean assemblage of material from the sixth century. The second issue we face at Tell en-Naßbeh is a stumbling block shared by other sites as well. The period spanned by the Babylonian and Persian Empires, while turbulent enough as a whole, seems to have left the hill country of Judah and Benjamin largely unscathed (Stern 2001: 353–60). Our main biblical sources, Kings and Jeremiah, leave off with the flight of a band of fugitive Judeans into Egypt not many years after Jerusalem’s destruction (2 Kgs 25:26; Jer 43:6). The next clear references we have to activities in Judah come in the later sixth century, after Cyrus had allowed the Judean elite to return home (Ezra 1–6; Zechariah 1–8; Haggai). Even these few texts have a limited scope of
3. The numbering system for buildings at Tell en-Naßbeh is based first on the section of 1:100 site plan in which the majority of the building is found and second on the order of discussion of the building in the author’s dissertation. For example, 110.01 indicates that this is the first building in map section 110 treated in the dissertation. Note that on all plans solid black indicates existing walls, and gray indicates reconstructed walls.



Tell en-Naßbeh and the Material Culture of the Sixth Century 417
interest, focusing primarily on Jerusalem and on the rebuilding of the Temple. Similarly, the Babylonian Chronicle is very fragmentary after Nebuchadnezzar’s 11th year (593); there are no reports of military campaigns aimed at Israel after the 597 campaign, not even the final destructive campaign of 587–586 (Grayson 1975: 19–20, 99–102 for Nebuchadnezzar II’s reign; also pp. 20–22, 103–10 for later monarchs). Moreover, despite the revolts and civil wars that often rocked the succeeding Persian Empire, especially the ones involving Egypt, there are no certain military actions against Judah during this entire era. Known military activities involving the Persians and Egyptians seem limited to the coast and Shephelah (Stern 2001: 576–78).4 What of more localized conflicts? While Nehemiah may have been concerned with military threats from his neighbors (Neh 4:1–9; 6:1–9), there is no clear evidence for the destruction of settlements at this time. Thus we are faced with strata that may begin in the sixth century (or perhaps even earlier) but continue after the return from the exile and even beyond the end of the sixth century At Tell en-Naßbeh I can demonstrate that Stratum 2 begins in the early sixth century and thus describe the architecture that characterizes this period, but other material indicates that these buildings continued in use into the later fifth century, meaning that artifactual remains recovered from fills from this stratum are a hodgepodge that cannot be said to characterize any one phase of this approximately 150-year period. Thus, at Tell en-Naßbeh we can achieve some idea of the kinds of buildings in use in the sixth century but little about the other aspects of daily life, unless we have other kinds of data that suggest a sixth-century date. Before moving on to a discussion of the remains from Naßbeh Stratum 2, we need briefly to summarize the architectural remains of the preceding Iron II stratum, which I have called Stratum 3. This will help establish the distinct nature of the Stratum 2 material.5
4. Stern (2001: 576–77), on the basis of the presence/absence of imported Greek pottery, suggests that a number of sites in the central hill country (Shechem, Tell enNaßbeh, Bethel, Tell el-Fûl, and Gibeon) were destroyed approximately 475 b.c.e., though he can find no historical agent for these destructions (also Ahlström 1994: 858; Aharoni 1979: 412). Most of theses sites were poorly excavated and/or published. The material from Naßbeh, as presented herein and including the Greek wares, demonstrates that at least one of these sites continued to exist until the end of the fifth century. 5. The stratigraphy developed by this author diverges markedly from the stratigraphy proposed by McCown and Wampler in the 1947 Tell en-Naßbeh report (TN I.179232). In that report the strata were numbered using Roman numerals. The revised stratigraphy employs Arabic numerals to differentiate the new stratigraphic scheme from the old.

Some of the basic characteristics of Stratum 3 have been known for years. The coffin-shaped form of the hill on which the town was constructed dictated its basic outline. The stepped structure of the natural limestone terraces of the hill helped determine the location of roads and the dwellings that faced them. The Iron II settlement’s main constructional phases are relatively clear (Zorn 1993c: 114–62; 1993b: 1099–1101; 1997b: 31–35). The initial phase of Stratum 3, 3C, consists of buildings and roads that followed the hill’s natural contours. The back rooms of the houses along the periphery of the site formed a casematelike wall, a rudimentary defense system. At some point a massive insetoffset wall was constructed down-slope from the existing town. This is phase 3B. Access to the town was provided through a monumental inner-outer gate complex. The southern intramural area was dotted with stone-lined storage bins, while the lower northern half of the intramural area was crossed by drains used to carry runoff water outside the walls. Phase 3A consists of remodelings of the original 3C houses, most clearly attested when they expanded into the intramural area. The initial phase of construction of Stratum 3C is dated to approximately the tenth century, primarily because a number of house walls are built over the mouths of rock-cut silos containing pottery from the Iron I period. On the basis of 1 Kgs 15:22, which records the construction of fortifications at Mizpah by King Asa of Judah, the offset-inset wall and gate complex are assigned to the ninth century (Zorn 1997b; 1999). The remodelings of 3A span the period from the ninth century down to the construction of Stratum 2 in the sixth century. Houses of the 3-room type make up almost half of all identifiable buildings in Stratum 3, while 4-room houses amount to only 1/10th of the total. Most buildings range in external size from 44 m2 to 86 m2, with an average of 65 m2; even the 4-room buildings average only 80 m2. Walls of 3C are a single stone in width, while those of 3A are two stones wide. Stone-paved floors were found in approximately 20 of the 73 identifiable buildings, and stone pillars, mostly built of rough stone drums, were found in 38 buildings (Zorn 1993c: 116–30). These statistics are vital when it comes to differentiating the relative quality of construction between Strata 3 and 2. Perhaps the most striking feature of Stratum 3 is how well the architecture is preserved. Often pillars are found still standing, and there are even lintels still in place; many rooms contained installations such as ovens and olive presses. In contrast to the state of the structural remains is the complete absence of in situ artifactual material. Room after room in building after building across the entire site was found

completely empty. It is important here to note that Badè’s team found no evidence of burning or any other destruction material in these buildings, something that would not have been missed even with the techniques then in use. What are we to make of this lack of in situ material? It seems that the entire population of Mizpah was allowed to collect all of its personal belongings and was then evacuated from the town, which was then demolished. My suggestion is that this deliberate peaceful destruction of Stratum 3, followed by its replacement with buildings of similar types, though of larger and finer construction and laid out in a completely different settlement plan, represents Gedaliah’s transformation of Mizpah from a fortified town on Judah’s northern border into a new administrative center. Form follows function. When I first began my work on Naßbeh, my eye was drawn to the stratigraphic and architectural relations of three large 4-room buildings located along the periphery of the Stratum 3 ring-road settlement. The first structure (fig. 3; Zorn 1993c: 898–901 = Building 194.01), in the southwest corner of the site, is clearly constructed over the line of the walls forming the casemate-like defenses of Stratum 3C, out into the intramural area and over some of the 3B bins. The second structure (fig. 4; Zorn 1993c: 710–14 = Building 145.02) is located just a few meters inside the inner, 4–chamber gate, an extremely awkward

420 Jeffrey R. Zorn
place for a dwelling because it is in the middle of the gate plaza, interrupting traffic flow in the area, and is in the immediate line of attack of any enemy who breeched the inner gate. It is also built over one of the 3B bins. The third structure is just inside the outer, 2–chamber gate (fig. 5; Zorn 1993c: 538–45 = Building 110.01) and is constructed over the wall that once connected the western parts of the inner and outer gates (Zorn 1997a: 60–61). None of these buildings is oriented in accordance with the ring-road. This is an important observation. Once the buildings of Stratum 3 had been filled in and leveled off, they functioned to create broader areas within the settlement than had been available before, when construction was dictated by the presence of the natural terracing of the hillside. It is thus clear that these three buildings postdated certain elements of the main Iron II stratum; this had already been noted by others.

These scholars generally dated these houses to sometime in the latter part of the Iron II period, approximately 700 b.c.e. or later (McClellan 1984: 54, Phase D; Branigan 1966: 208; Herzog 1997: 237). What they did not recognize is that these buildings were not an isolated series of

422 Jeffrey R. Zorn
structures along the periphery of the site but were part of a larger, though fragmentary, architectural phase that can be isolated in similar stratigraphic contexts scattered across the site. That is, these three buildings are part of a much more extensive, separate stratum later than Stratum 3 than is usually realized.6 First, there are remains of what appear to be three additional 4room houses, all of approximately the same size as those previously identified, about 12.5 x 10.5 m, and likewise oriented independently of the ring-road. The first of these is located in the north center of the tell; it clearly blocks remains of adjacent 3-room buildings and a transversal road cutting across the ridge of the tell (fig. 6; Zorn 1993c: 568–70 = Building 125.01). The second is located to the east, near what appears to be the intramural area adjacent to the outer gate (fig. 4; Zorn 1993c:
6. The following presentation discusses only the most-significant architectural remains of Stratum 2. Zorn 1993c provides a full discussion of all remains assignable to this phase in the site’s development.

602–5 = Building 127.03). The third is just to the northwest of the inner gate (fig. 5; Zorn 1993c: 501–4 = Building 93.03). Remains of a fourth building of roughly similar proportions, though with little of the interior preserved, or perhaps not excavated, were found between this house and the one just inside the outer gate (fig. 5; Zorn 1993c: 592–95 = Building 127.01). In the north-central part of the site are remains of a building with double-stone-wide walls that clearly interrupts the flow of Stratum 3 buildings to the west (fig. 7; Zorn 1993c: 173–74, 424–27, 449–50 = Building 74.01). This building was not completely excavated, due to the massive pile of rubble to the south, nor completely preserved on the north and east. However, enough survives to indicate that it was about 18 m wide and well over 15 m long. Two patches of cobblestone paving were found in the large central room. The visible part of this building is over 2.5 times the size of any Stratum 3 building. The surviving remains suggest that this was a courtyard-style building in the Mesopotamian tradition, similar to Buildings 1052 and 1369 from Strata III–II at

424 Jeffrey R. Zorn
Megiddo (Megiddo I.69–72, fig. 89) though on a smaller scale, more like Building 736 of Stratum I (Megiddo I.88, fig. 98). Just to the west of the inner gate are the remains of an approximately 25-m-long wall built over the outer wall of the original casemate-like defenses of Stratum 3C (fig. 4; Zorn 1993c: 694–96). The only preserved corner is on the north, so its full extent is unknown. The majority of remains preserved inside this wall seem to belong to Stratum 3 structures. That there are no interior walls branching off this long wall suggests that this was an enclosure or terrace wall for some other structure to the west. A 3-room house was sandwiched into the area between the inner gate, the enclosure wall, and one of the 4-room buildings, 127.03 (fig. 4; Zorn 1993c: 686–92 = Building 144.01). Indeed this dwelling is built right against the north face of the gate and would have blocked all access to it if it belonged to Stratum 3. In the south-central part of the site there are remains of two long rooms connected to each other diagonally at the corner (fig. 8; Zorn 1993c: 785–88 = Building 160.10). The more northern of the two lies

over a Stratum-3 road that crosses the center of the town and over what may be remains of a 3-room house. The southern room is built over the back rooms of two 4-room houses. Additional walls to the east and the west are likely also associated with this structure. Such long rooms are often used for storage, which might then be the function of these rooms. Unfortunately the remains are fragmentary, and so the character of these rooms is only conjectural. Just to the southwest of these rooms is a confusing mass of architecture (fig. 9; Zorn 1993c: 742–47 = Building 159.07; pp. 845–49 = Building 177.06). It is clear that many of the double-stone-wide walls here are constructed over the back parts of at least six houses ranged around the periphery of the Stratum 3C town and into the fill poured up against the massive offset-inset wall of 3B. The remains stretch over an

area at least 44 m long by about 16 m wide. What cannot be determined is whether these remains are part of one extremely large structure (possibly of the open-court variety) or represent two or more buildings. During the leveling operations that created the surface area for Stratum 2, the old inner-outer double gate complex that defended the entrance to the Stratum 3 down was partially dismantled (Zorn 1997a).7 The inner, 4–chamber gate went out of use, as did the western
7. Note that Herzog’s contention (1997: 237) that my reconstruction of the innerouter gate complex at Tell en-Naßbeh “is unacceptable because of the long distance separating the units and their almost level topographic position” was written before Zorn 1997a appeared. This article explains in detail the local topographic conditions that necessitated the construction of the system as reconstructed and answers the issues raised by Herzog.

wall that connected the two gates; only the outer, 2–chamber gate remained in use. Evidently this was a prime area for redevelopment in Stratum 2, and the need for building space outweighed defensive considerations under the Babylonian administration. The broad chronological limits of Stratum 2 are established by the in situ pottery from two of the 4-room houses: 110.01 near the two chamber gate and 125.01 at the center of the tell. Room 642 in the latter structure produced remains of four huge sack-shaped pithoi (fig. 10). The hole-mouth specimens have good parallels at sites with early sixth-century destructions, such as Lachish II (Zimhoni 1990: 421–24, fig. 31:3) and Jerusalem (Mazar and Mazar 1990: 44; phs. 85–86; pl. 20:6–7). The example with the high raised neck has a good parallel in Arad Stratum VI. In Building 110.01, Rooms 376 and 380 produced a number of storage jars (fig. 11) with good parallels at Tel Michal Strata IX and VIII, dated by the excavators to between 450 and 400 (Tel Michal, 122, 124; figs. 9.3:2–6, 9.5:5–8). How can two buildings of the same stratum have in situ pottery dating around 100–150 years apart? In her work among traditional potters on Cyprus, Gloria London discovered that massive pithoi, such as those from Building 125.01, once set in place can be in use for decades; in fact, she reported examples from Cyprus that were a century old (London 1989: 44). It is therefore likely that the pithoi on the floor of Building 125.01 were installed when Stratum 2 was constructed near the beginning of the sixth century, whereas the jars found in 110.01 were produced in the latter part of the fifth century and represent the final period of the life of Stratum 2. Besides these relatively clearly identifiable architectural remains, there are other fragmentary buildings scattered around the site that are obviously later than Stratum 3. Sometimes these are just wall fragments, other times they make up nearly an entire room, but not enough is preserved to suggest a reconstruction. There are also certain identifying constructional differences between Strata 2 and 3 (Zorn 1993c: 167–71, 173). Stone paved floors were more common in Stratum 2 buildings than in Stratum 3. In buildings containing pillars, all of the Stratum 2 pillars were of the more costly to produce monolithic type. Stratum 2 walls were almost always two stones wide, except often in areas that needed more reinforcement, such as corners or doorways, where single large stones of almost ashlar quality were found. The leveling operations that destroyed Stratum 3 also created broader internal spaces in which the new larger buildings could be erected. The smallest buildings in Stratum 2 are the 4-room



Tell en-Naßbeh and the Material Culture of the Sixth Century 429
houses. These average approximately 130 m2, more than twice the size of typical Stratum 3 buildings, and more than 1.5 times the size of even the 4-room houses of Stratum 3 (Zorn 1993c: 119–20). No doubt the officials now residing at Mizpah did not want to live in the same sort of cramped conditions as the townspeople of Stratum 3 had. Finally, not only were the buildings larger, but they seem more widely spaced. It is clear that buildings of Stratum 2 were universally larger, less crowded, and of better construction than those of Stratum 3. Joseph Wampler, who published the Naßbeh pottery, identified a number of cisterns that he dated to the sixth century and later (Wampler 1941: 31–42; 1947: 124–25; TN II.129–39). Many of his conclusions about the general dating of these features are still valid. Indeed his “feel” for the dating of the pottery, especially the late forms, was often remarkably sound. These cisterns, though cut earlier in the Iron Age, continued in use into the sixth century and later. Unfortunately, earlier Iron Age material is also found in these features, and they cannot be considered homogenous deposits. Here I want to mention only two of the more important cisterns: 361 and 304. Cistern 304 was found at the highest point of bedrock in the center of the mound. Fragmentary building remains, including a pillared wall and sections of other single-stone-width walls, suggest that Cistern 304 was initially in the courtyard of a Stratum 3 house that

fronted on a road running perpendicular across the spine of the hill (fig. 12; Zorn 1993c: 679–82 = Building 143.02). The thicker walls in the area that cut across remains of this building, the crossroad, and the contemporary Stratum 3 structure across the road should be assigned to Stratum 2. The cistern contained a mix of Iron Age and later material (fig. 13). Among the later finds are the bottom portion of a

Clazomenian amphora of the second half of the sixth century, a portion of a vessel with wedge-impressed decoration, and a wall-handle fragment of a fifth-century kylix or cup. Another piece of interest is an ostracon (see below) that preserves part of what appears to be a Mesopotamian name (Wampler 1941: 31–36; TN I.135, 141, fig. 26:D). Cistern 361 was found in Room 604 in the center of a large Stratum 3 building (fig. 14; Zorn 1993c: 644–49 = Building 142.01). This structure is located along the downhill side of the adjacent ring-road. A set of stairs leads up from Room 604 to what would have been the building’s second story. We are thus only dealing with the building’s lower floor. There was no access to Room 604 from the adjoining rooms, only from the upper floor. A large boulder, perhaps a reused stone basin,

pierced through its center, is shown in photographs adjacent to the opening to the cistern, apparently after it had been moved away from the cistern mouth during excavation (fig. 15).8 It seems that this pierced stone was used to raise the mouth of the cistern so that it was directly accessible from a higher level, something like a well shaft. Most likely this would have been in Stratum 2, after the lower portion of Building 142.01 had been filled in to create a new surface for Stratum 2. Unfortunately, few Stratum 2 building remains were found in the vicinity, so it is impossible to say with what kind of structure the cistern was associated in its latest phase. The cistern contained two M(W)ÍH impressions, parts of two vessels with wedge-impressed decorations, and a shoulder fragment of a black-figure oionoche of the

fifth century (fig. 16). The cistern also contained a nice torpedo-shaped jar of the Persian period, bowls reminiscent of Assyrian palace ware and Persian vessels, and other vessels of the post–Iron Age period (Wampler 1941: 36–42; TN I.137). Thus far we have examined the major architectural remains from Tell en-Naßbeh that clearly postdate the Iron Age ring-road phase, establishing their locations on the mound and something of their construction techniques. We have also been able to show that they date to a period spanning the sixth century down into the latter half of the fifth century. The architectural remains of Stratum 2 have the clearest claim to a Babylonian-era pedigree due to the breadth of their exposure, their secure stratigraphic position, and the clear dating material found in situ on the floors of two of the buildings. We now come to the artifactual remains, the smaller objects. The fact that most Stratum 2 buildings are preserved only at foundation level means that virtually none of these pieces comes from a clean stratigraphic context, which, as mentioned in the introduction, is one of the primary dilemmas we face at many sites and which makes establishing the material culture of the sixth century so difficult. The first groups of objects to be examined will be those with the greatest claim to a Babylonian-era provenance. Tell en-Naßbeh has produced fragments of three Mesopotamianstyle bathtub-shaped coffins (fig. 17; Zorn 1993a). These were all found on the tell itself in areas in which clear building remains from Stratum 2 were located. One fragment was found in the same square that produced a small bronze button base beaker, commonly found in coffin and jar burials in Mesopotamia (Boehmer et al. 1995: 40, pls. 104 and 107; Zorn 1996).9 It is significant that these coffins were found on the tell. Because corpses were considered a source of ritual pollution, Israelite practice was to inter the dead in extramural tombs. Their presence on the tell shows that the Mesopotamian practice of interring the dead below the floors of their homes was being followed. Were these the graves of Babylonian officials or of Judeans aping Babylonian fashion?
9. In Zorn 1996 the association of the bronze beaker with the coffin fragment found in the same square was not discussed because it did not seem likely that the beaker, found in a cistern, and the coffin fragment, found in the surface fill, could be related, especially since most of the pottery in Cistern 363 is clearly Iron Age. However, fragments of a fairly large Stratum 2 building (Zorn 1993c: 675–76 = Building 142.00) were found immediately east of the cistern, and the mouth of the cistern had been artificially raised by surrounding it with a low stone wall, perhaps not unlike the effort made to raise the mouth of Cistern 361. In light of these observations there may be a relation of Cistern 363 to the early part of Stratum 2 after all, and so the beaker with the coffin.

No doubt the most enigmatic object from Tell en-Naßbeh is a fragment of a bronze circlet bearing a cuneiform inscription (fig. 19; TN I.150–53, pl. 55:80; Zorn 1997b: 38 is a clearer image). This object was found in Cistern 166, which contained Late Iron Age pottery; unfortunately, the area around it was largely denuded of any architectural

context (Zorn 1993c: 883–84; TN I.130–31, 145, fig. 30:D). The piece is approximately 1.5 mm thick, 11 mm wide, and 16 cm long, suggesting an original diameter of 50 cm. Eleven characters out of what was likely a 30–35-character text are preserved. The shortness of the preserved portion makes translation difficult. In the opinion of Wayne Horowitz and David Vanderhooft, it is clearly a private donation inscription, but their initial readings differ markedly from those in the original publication.10 Moreover, it is unknown to which deity it was dedicated, to what sort of object it was affixed, or how it was attached to this object.
10. The interest of both these scholars was drawn to this piece as a result of the public lecture on which this article is based. It is gratifying that this important inscription is being rediscovered by a new generation of scholars. They hope to publish a new edition of this text in the near future.

Cistern 361, as mentioned above, produced an ostracon (fig. 20) that contains an apparently Mesopotamian name written with Hebrew characters (Wampler 1941: 31 and n. 9, fig. 9; TN I.168–69, pl. 57:23). The preserved signs are: rxrsrmn and should be read as: [be]n mar-sarriußur = ‘[so]n of [?], protect the crown prince’.11 Names compounded

with sarru or ‘king’ were often the names of Mesopotamian officials (Stamm 1939: 317). It may be that names similarly compounded with mar sarri or ‘crown prince’ were also most often those of officials.12 The coffin fragments, circlet, and ostracon provide strong evidence of the depth of Babylonian influence at Mizpah. Ancient Israel has produced 43 examples of stamped jar handles bearing an inscription reading hxm = MÍH or hxwm = MWÍH (fig. 18; Zorn et al. 1994). Thirty of these come from Tell en-Naßbeh, suggesting that Mizpah was the key center in the use and distribution of jars sealed with these stamps. The remaining impressions come from an area defined by Íobah on the west and Jericho on the east, and from Tell en-Naßbeh on the north to Ramat Ra ̇el on the south—roughly the area of the tribe of Benjamin. Few of these pieces come from stratigraphically secure contexts, but those that do suggest a date from the end of the Iron II period to the beginning of the Persian period—that is,

the sixth century. Neutron Activation Analysis has shown that the jars themselves were produced in the Jerusalem area. It is likely that they were used to store and transport some product produced at a government estate at the town of Mozah, just west of Jerusalem. The limited distribution of these stamps to the area of Benjamin and the fact that 70% of such stamps come from Tell en-Naßbeh are significant for our understanding of the post–Babylonian destruction administrative and economic structure of Gedaliah’s territory. As was suggested by Malamat long ago (1950: 227), the Babylonians seem to have left the area of Benjamin relatively undisturbed during their year-and-a-half-long siege of Jerusalem. Certainly it was to their advantage to spare this area, if only to exploit it as a source of supplies during a siege of uncertain duration. This suggests that this was also the core area that Gedaliah could count on for material support at the beginning of his administration. While most of Judah and Jerusalem suffered great devastation as a result of the war, and no doubt many perished in the conflict and in the immediately following period of civil and economic dislocation, some number of people were left to eke out their survival in the gutted areas. These survivors and refugees were in no position to help support the central administration in Mizpah, and we find no real trace of that administration’s presence in those areas. The next group of artifacts has a somewhat lesser claim to a sixthcentury pedigree. They might be earlier (seventh century) or some

what later (fifth century), but at least a reasonable case can be made for attributing them to the Babylonian era. Tell en-Naßbeh produced four examples of bronze, trilobate, socalled “Skythian” arrowheads from fills inside the tell (TN I.263, 302; fig. 71:9–10; pl. 104:8–11).13 Stern (2001: 309, 532) suggests that the introduction of these arrowheads is to be linked with the Babylonian campaigns into the Levant, though they continued in use through the

Persian period. If this is so, and since Mizpah was not destroyed in the Babylonian invasions, and since our biblical text reports the presence of Babylonian soldiers at Mizpah (Jer 41:3), and since the arrowheads were found inside the town, it may be that the arrowheads are evidence of this garrison, or perhaps the adoption of this type of arrowhead by the Judeans. Brief mention should also be made of the justly famous Jaaazaniah seal (fig. 22; TN I.163, pl. 57:4–5; Badè 1933). The inscription on the upper part of this 19-mm-long stone seal reads: “Jaaazaniah, the servant/

officer of the king.” The lower half is decorated with the image of a rooster in a fighting stance. The seal was found in Tomb 19. Unfortunately, aside from a few fragments of pottery, this seal was the only object from the Iron Age found in this tomb, which had apparently originally been a typical Iron Age bench tomb that had been recut and reused in the Byzantine period (TN I.118–20, 122). The question naturally arises whether the individual who owned this seal was the same military officer named Jaaazaniah mentioned in association with Gedaliah at Mizpah in 2 Kgs 25:23 and Jer 40:8. While certainty on the issue is unattainable, it is not impossible that the Jaaazaniah of the biblical text was one of the Judeans who was murdered during Ishmael’s attempted coup and who was subsequently buried at Mizpah, along with his seal. Approximately 160 examples of vessels, primarily hole-mouth jars and deep kraters, decorated with rows of impressed wedges or circles, have been published from ancient Israel; including unpublished material, this figure climbs to over 200 (Zorn 2001). Of the 160 published vessels, 130 come from the area of Judah, and 62 of these specimens come from Tell en-Naßbeh (fig. 21). Most of the rest come from Jerusalem, Ramat Ra ̇el, Ein-gedi, Tell el-Fûl, Beth-Zur, and Jericho, a wider distribution than the MWÍH impressions. In addition, 2 examples come from oUmeiri in Jordan, and 8 are known from sites in north Arabia. The distribution of this material suggests that Naßbeh was an important center in the production or trade of these vessels. A source analysis of the clay of these containers is a desideratum. At this stage it is not certain exactly what the find pattern of these vessels signifies. Perhaps the distribution from north Arabia through Jordan and into Judah is connected with the increased interest in the trade in incense that began with the Assyrians and carried through into the Persian period. Perhaps the vessels may be taken as markers indicating trade connections extending from north Arabia through Judah to the coast. Their wider distribution in Judah, as compared with vessels with the M(W)ÍH impressions, may suggest an initial phase for the production of these

vessels at a time when the economy in Judah had begun to recover from the devastation wrought by the Babylonians, but when Mizpah was still one of, if not the, major center in Judah—perhaps the mid-tolate sixth century. In general this entire corpus of artifacts is attributed to the sixth century for several reasons. First is that most often they are unknown in the seventh century and seem to be more sparse in the fifth century, suggesting a sixth-century date for their main or initial period of use. Second, while some of them could come from the seventh century or earlier, suggesting a context of a small Judean border town of that era seems less plausible than attributing them to a minor provincial center of the Babylonian Empire. That is, they seem to fit the latter historical/ functional category best, though a firm set of chronological boundaries is elusive. For example, what would Mesopotamian-style coffins be doing in the middle of a crowded Judean town of the Late Iron Age? It seems more reasonable to assign them to a period when Mizpah was a known center of a local Mesopotamian installed administration. A final issue relevant to our understanding of the sixth century is whether Mizpah of the Babylonian period possessed a significant cult site or temple. This is a vexed question and cannot be examined here in depth. Essentially, some see Jer 41:4–5 (assuming that “temple of the Lord” is a reference to a structure in Mizpah, not Jerusalem) and 1 Macc 3:46 (reference to a former place of prayer at Mizpah) as evidence for a temple or cult site at Mizpah in this period (TN I.32), and further see any references to cultic activity at Mizpah in Judges 20–21 and 1 Samuel 7 and 10 as attempts by authors writing in the Persian (or later) period to give Mizpah an older but unwarranted cultic pedigree (TN I.24–28). Most, however, do not accept the Jer 41:4–5 reference to a “temple of the Lord” as relating to Mizpah at all but believe that the pilgrims intended to make their offerings in the ruined Jerusalem Temple (for example, Bright 1965: 254). Some of these scholars, and others, accept the Judges and 1 Samuel traditions as reflecting a genuinely ancient set of cultic associations for Mizpah (for example, Fohrer 1972: 112; McCarter 1980: 143–44; Langston 1998: 148–49) and not as later story-making. In a passage of general condemnation of the cultic practices of the Israelites (Hosea 4–5), mention is made of priests’ and kings’ being a “snare” at Mizpah (5:2), an expression echoed in other biblical passages dealing with improper worship (for example, Exod 23:33; Judg 2:3; and others). Unfortunately, it is unclear which of the several known Mizpahs is meant, though the focus seems generally to be on places in the Ephraim-Benjamin area. If so, this may be one of the



Tell en-Naßbeh and the Material Culture of the Sixth Century 443
few pieces of evidence for an Iron II cultic role for Mizpah of Benjamin (Andersen and Freedman 1980: 385–86). The question of the cultic role of Mizpah is one area to which archaeology might be expected to make a contribution, considering how much of Tell en-Naßbeh has been excavated. However, while artifactual remains of a cultic nature were recovered (TN I.233–48; pls. 84–90; TN II, pls. 78–79), some of them in significant concentrations (for example, Holladay 1987: 274–75), it is not possible to isolate anything on the scale of the Arad temple at Tell en-Naßbeh (Langston 1998: 15154). Surely there were household shrines at Mizpah, as suggested by the scores of female pillar-base figurines recovered, but these do not make a shrine of such significance as to attract pilgrims from the North. On the other hand, given the great number of local shrines and temples in ancient Israel, attested both biblically and archaeologically, there is no a priori reason that Mizpah could not have possessed a small local shrine of its own.14 However, did this picture of Mizpah as a minor, at best, cultic center change after 586? Did the establishment of Mizpah as the new focal point of political life also necessitate the elevation of Mizpah to the position of the region’s cultic center, or were the remains of the Temple complex in Jerusalem still functioning sufficiently for certain rites to be practiced there? If there were sanctuaries or temples still functioning in the old hill country of Ephraim and Manasseh (2 Kgs 17:24–34), it is difficult to believe that pilgrims would journey all the way to Mizpah, only recently transformed into the capital of a minor province and possessing a cult site of no major importance, when they could have gone to their own shrines or temples.15 It seems more likely that only the remains of the old national Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem could elicit such a response from the Northerners (as in the time of Jeroboam I; 1 Kgs 12:26–28) and that Mizpah had no significant national cultic role during the Babylonian period. Mention should be also be made of certain remains that also help establish the continued existence of Tell en-Naßbeh to the end of the fifth century. Tell en-Naßbeh produced 29 pieces, mostly smaller fragments,

Dever (1995) provides a review of recent trends in the field of Israelite religion and contains useful bibliography. 15. Josiah reportedly destroyed the temple at Bethel (2 Kgs 23:15), but how far his “reforms” were carried out in the north is uncertain. In any event, given how largely ineffectual they were in his own kingdom, it would not be surprising if cultic activities at Bethel and other Northern sites were renewed following Josiah’s death.

of Attic pottery, mostly of black figure or black slipped variety. These span the late sixth to fifth centuries (TN I.175–178, pls. 59–60). In addition, 18 Yehud stamp impressions, spelling either hy = YH (12) or dhy = YHD (6), were found, confirming Tell en-Naßbeh’s inclusion within the Persian administrative system (TN I.164–65, pl. 57:1–3, 13–19). An imitation of an early Attic bronze tetradrachm was found in square AA24 in the fill of Room 324 of 3-Room Building 114.01 of Stratum 2 described above (TN I.174, 275; pl. 102:1). It is dated to the end of the fifth century. The lack of Greek pottery and coins of the fourth century suggests a gap in occupation from the late Persian period until the early part of the Hellenistic period, when Stratum 1 was founded, which seems primarily to have been an agricultural estate of sorts (Zorn 1993c: 186–99). The in situ remains in Building 110.01 suggest that Tell en-Naßbeh was destroyed, though not burned, in the second half of the fifth century. The lack of any significant amount of fourth-century or later material from the general debris tends to confirm this date. The fundamental cruxes are: who destroyed Mizpah and when? Unfortunately, the historical data to decide these issues are lacking. Possibly this event should be connected with the successful Egyptian revolt against Persia at the end of the fifth century and the ensuing Egyptian–Cypriote activities in Syria and Israel in the early fourth century (Ahlström 1994: 872–87; Aharoni 1979: 413; Hayes and Miller 1986: 465). The material presented from Tell en-Naßbeh clearly shows the potential and the limitations that we face in reconstructing the material culture of the sixth century. On the one hand, we have here clear architectural remains of a reasonably flourishing provincial center founded in the sixth century and continuing into the fifth century. The size, nature, and quality of construction of the buildings shows that these were no mean hovels but were the residences of officials and other administrative structures. The coffins, circlet, ostracon, and courtyard building suggest a not-insignificant Mesopotamian influence at the site. The M(W)ÍH impressions attest to the relatively small resource area that the new administration could effectively draw on. The wedge-impressed pottery, Greek pottery, and Yehud impressions attest to a further, broader revival of Judean society in the latter part of the sixth and fifth centuries. Clearly the Babylonian administration did not collapse after the murder of Gedaliah. On the other hand we have a stratum apparently established in 586 that continued for approximately 150 years to the latter part of the fifth century. Because there was no destruction during this time, and



Tell en-Naßbeh and the Material Culture of the Sixth Century 445
because most of the Stratum 2 buildings are so poorly preserved, we cannot establish a clear idea of the material culture of any single subphase of this period. We are left with a collage of objects mixed together that covers the entire life of the stratum. While this is not what we, as archaeologists and historians, might prefer, it is what the vagaries of excavation have given us and what we must work with. However, it is not such a bad thing. Fifteen years ago we could say relatively little archaeologically about the Babylonian period in ancient Judah. The curtain has been pulled back just a little now. Perhaps someday, when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is resolved, we can return to the area of Benjamin to reexcavate some old sites and explore some that are still untouched, because it is just in this area that our greatest hope for material from the early sixth century lies.

Settlement of the Jews at Elephantine and
the Arameans at Syene
Bezalel Porten
Hebrew University of Jerusalem
All migration is a function of push-pull. There are forces that drive persons out of their home territory and counterforces that attract them into their new homes. Jacob and his family migrated to Egypt because of famine in the land of Canaan and the invitation of Joseph to come and settle. When and why did Jews and Arameans leave their respective homelands to take up residence in the twin forts of ElephantineSyene at the first cataract of the Nile in Egypt, in what is today Aswan and gezirat-Aswan? This question cannot be separated from its companion—when and why did the Jews erect a temple at Elephantine? It is not enough to say that, just as the Arameans set up temples on the mainland to Bethel, the Queen of Heaven, Banit, and Nabu (TAD A2.1:1, 2.2:1, 2.3:1, 2.4:1), so the Jews did for their deity on the island. Were there no temples along the waters of Babylon to imitate? Yet there the exiles even declined to sing the songs of Zion, let alone offer up animal sacrifices. There they sufficed with a f[m çdqm ‘a reduced holiness’, ‘a diminished sanctuary’, to use the expression offered by Ezekiel as translated by the njpsv (Ezek 11:16). But on the banks of the Nile, the Egyptian-born wife of a minor temple official identified herself as atrb by ˆkç ahla why yz hnjl ‘servitor of YHW the God (who) dwells in Elephantine the fortress’ (TAD B3.12:1–2). Barely a çdqm in Babylon, but the hnykç rested in Elephantine! And even more fascinating is the fact that, were it not for the discovery of Aramaic papyri and ostraca, we would never have known of the existence of the Elephantine Jewish community with its temple. There was no Josephus to record its annals; no Mishnah to tell of its sacrifices; no reference in Herodotus, who visited the island during his stay in Egypt. Jeremiah knew of the Jews who lived in Migdol, in Tahpanhes, and in Memphis, but if they also resided on Elephantine in his day, they were subsumed under the heading “land of Pathros” (Jer 44:1). Imagine writing today about Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem, but referring to Eilat as “the



452 Bezalel Porten
southland,” for that is what Pathros means. In a word, the Elephantine Jewish community, temple and all, left no impression on the collective Jewish memory. Or virtually none. In one of his prophecies of restoration, DeuteroIsaiah foretells the ingathering of the exiles from the four corners of the earth, commencing in the east and proceeding counterclockwise. His southern and final compass point reads in the Masoretic Text ≈ra μynys ‘land of the Sinim’ (Isa 49:12). Though some scholars identified this early on with Syene (Olmstead 1931: 598), it was not until 1950 that we learned that the prophet had indeed intended μyynws ≈ra ‘land of the Syenians’, for this was the reading in the newly discovered Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa) from the Dead Sea (Parry and Qimron 1999: 83).1 In fact, in one of the important Elephantine letters, the Jews called themselves “Syenians” (TAD A4.10:6), a designation that continued through the Byzantine Greek papyri (EPE D22:7, 25:5, 33:24, 39:11). The prophet Ezekiel knew the place from the Egyptian equivalent of the Israelite “from Dan to Beersheba” (1 Sam 3:20, etc.), namely, “from Migdol to Syene” (Ezek 29:10; 30:6). But this was purely topographical, without reference to a Jewish settlement. It remained for the discovery of the Elephantine papyri and ostraca to flesh in Deutero-Isaiah’s bare-bones reference to Jews at Aswan. The first Aramaic papyrus to be discovered was a letter sent from Shelomam to Osea, and it opens with the greeting byb why ty[yb μlç] ‘[Greetings to the Te]mple of YHW in Elephantine’ (TAD A3.3:1). This was acquired by the Italian explorer and adventurer Giovanni Battista Belzoni sometime between 1815 and 1819 but lay in the Padua Museum until published by Edda Bresciani (1960: 11–24). Some 75 years after Belzoni’s acquistion, the American entrepreneur Charles Edwin Wilbour acquired (in 1893) the archive of Anani, son of Azariah, the above-cited atryb byb yz ahla hhy yz ˆjl ‘servitor of YHH the God who is in Elephantine the fortress’ (TAD B3.3:2). These documents, too, lay unknown to the world until bequeathed to the Brooklyn Museum in 1947 by Wilbour’s daughter Theodora and published by Emil G. Kraeling in 1953, 60 years after their discovery. It was only in 1903, 10 years after their discovery, that the scholarly world first encountered the Aramaic name for Elephantine (by) and read a document drawn up there by Jews. The name was recognized by Charles ClermontGanneau in an Aramaic papyrus published by Julius Euting (TAD

A4.5:3; Kraeling 1953: 11). The document was an IOU published by Archibald Henry Sayce, drawn up approximately 487 b.c.e. by Gemariah, son of Ahio, and witnessed by, among others, Mahseiah, son of Jedaniah (TAD B4.2:1, 14, 16). The nature of the document led to the conclusion that the Jews there were money-lenders. A year later, in 1904, the English Lady William Cecil and Sir Robert Mond acquired the archive of this Mahseiah, and in 1906 it was published by Sayce and Arthur Ernest Cowley. Two items discussed by them are noteworthy here. (1) Two documents depict the ahla hhy yz arwga as one of the house boundaries (TAD B2.7:14, 10:6). The editors alternated between “altar” and “chapel” in their explanation of the site. (2) Second, they observed that almost every party had an affiliation to a Persian or Babylonian, introduced by a word that could be read either lgrl or lgdl. They preferred the former reading and proposed that it meant clientship, as in ancient Rome and Mamluk Egypt, and later came to indicate residence in a particular quarter (Cecil and Mond 1906: 11, 41, note to line 14). The title the editors gave their work indicates another bad choice they made. Though the actual spot on the island of Elephantine from which the papyri came was pointed out to them, they preferred to believe a second version, that the papyri were found at Aswan (Cecil and Mond 1906: 9). Not so Otto Rubensohn. He gained the confidence of the dealer and the sebbach diggers who led him to the find spot in Elephantine, secured the support of the Royal Museum of Berlin and the permission of the Director of Antiquities, Gaston Maspero, and began the first of three seasons on January 30, 1906. Almost a year later, less than a month into the second season, on New Year’s Day, 1907,2 he made the great discovery, one meter south of the spot pointed out to him earlier, of three of the letters concerned with the destruction and attempts to secure the restoration of the atryb byb yz ahla why yz arwga (TAD A4.7–9). On 25 July, Eduard Sachau presented to the Royal Prussian Academy a preliminary edition, published on 10 October, corrected on 12 December, and reprinted on 8 February, 1908. A complete edition of all the Aramaic papyri was completed by Sachau on 1 July, 1911, and published that same year. It contained 75 Plates, including one of the Euting Papyrus (Sachau 1911).
2. The first reference to discovery of Aramaic papyri in Rubensohn’s Tagesbuch (Müller 1980: 82) falls on January 1, 1907, when he raised the question, “Are we here at the spot whence the Mond Aramaic papyri stem? Seems to me very likely?” He affirms this in a brief note (Sachau 1908: 45–46) and again later (Honroth, Rubensohn, and Zucker 1909–10: 14).

Let us have a look at the first of Rubensohn’s three letters, the one from the head of the Elephantine Jewish community, Jedaniah, to the Persian-named governor of Judah (dwhy tjp), Bagavahya, popularly known as Bagohi. We cite the letter in full and comment on pertinent passages:
The Text of the Letter
Recto
Internal Address
1To our lord Bagavahya, governor of Judah, your servants Jedaniah and his colleagues the priests who are in Elephantine the fortress. Fourfold Salutation
The welfare 2of our lord may the God of Heaven seek after abundantly at all times, and favor may He grant you before Darius the king 3and the princes more than now a thousand times, and long life may He give you, and happy and strong may you be at all times. Report 4Now, your servant Jedaniah and his colleagues thus say: Plot In the month of Tammuz, year 14 of Darius the king, when Arsames 5left and went to the king, the priests of Khnub the god who (are) in Elephantine the fortress, in agreement with Vidranga who 6was 5Chief here, (said), 6saying: “The temple of YHW the God that is in Elephantine the fortress, let them remove from there.” Order Afterwards, that Vidranga, 7the wicked, a letter sent to Nafaina, his son, who was Troop Commander in Syene the fortress, saying: “The temple that is in Elephantine 8the fortress let them demolish.” Demolition Afterwards, Nafaina led the Egyptians with the other troops. They came to the fortress of Elephantine with their implements, 9broke into that temple, demolished it to the ground, and the pillars of stone that were there—they smashed them. Moreover, it happened (that the) 105 9gateways 10of stone, built of hewn stone, that were in that temple, they demolished. And their standing doors and the pivots 11of those doors, (of) bronze, and the roof of wood of cedar—all (of these) which, with the rest of the fittings and other (things), 12were 11there—12all (of these) with fire they burned. But the basins of gold and silver and the (other) things that were in that temple—all (of these) they took 13and made their own. Precedents And from the days of the king(s) of Egypt our fathers had built that temple in Elephantine the fortress and when Cambyses entered Egypt—14that temple, built he found it. And the temples of the gods of Egypt, all (of them), they overthrew, but anything in that temple one did not damage. Aftermath Mourning I Punishment
15And when (the) like(s of) this had been done (to us), we, with our wives and our children, sackcloth were wearing and fasting and praying to YHW the Lord of Heaven 16who let us gloat over that Vidranga, the cur. They removed the fetter from his feet, and all goods that he had acquired were lost. And all persons 17who sought evil for that temple, all (of them), were killed, and we gazed upon them.

1. The internal address informs us that Jedaniah stood at the head of a coterie of priests and, like Mordecai in Susa the fortress (Esth 1:2), at one end of the Persian Empire, they were located in Elephantine the fortress at the other. 2. Jedaniah invokes the divine epithet (aymç hla) regularly used in official Aramaic letters embedded in the book of Ezra (5:11–12; 6:9–10; 7:12, 21, 23), in the Cyrus Proclamation (Ezra 1:2 || 2 Chr 36:23), and in Nehemiah’s memoirs (Neh 1:4–5; 2:4, 20). 3. While the satrap Arsames was away on home leave, the local Persian governor, Vidranga, conspired with the Egyptian priests of Khnum to have the Jewish temple destroyed. The act was carried out by Egyptians under the command of Nafaina, who was the Troop Commander of Syene and the son of Vidranga.
Appeal Moreover, before this, at the time that this evil [Verso] 18was done to us, a letter we sent (to) our lord, and to Jehohanan, the High Priest, and his colleagues, the priests who are in Jerusalem, and to Avastana, the brother 19of Anani, and the nobles of the Jews. A letter they did not send us. Mourning II Moreover, from the month of Tammuz, year 14 of Darius the king 20and until this day, we, sackcloth have been wearing and have been fasting; the wives of ours like a widow have been made; (with) oil (we) have not anointed (ourselves), 21and wine have not drunk. Cessation of Cult
Moreover, from that (time) and until (this) day, year 17 of Darius the king, meal-offering and ince[n]se and burnt-offering 22they did not make in that temple. Petition Now, your servants Jedaniah and his colleagues and the Jews, all (of them) citizens of Elephantine, thus say: Threefold Request
23If to our lord it is good, take thought of that temple to (re)build (it) since they do not let us (re)build it. Regard 24your 23ob24ligees and your friends who are here in Egypt. May a letter from you be sent to them about the temple of YHW the God 25to (re)build it in Elephantine the fortress just as it had been built formerly. Threefold Blessing
And the meal-offering and the incense and the burnt-offering they will offer 26on the altar of YHW the God in your name, and we shall pray for you at all times—we and our wives and our children and the Jews, 27all (of them) who are here. If thus they did until that temple be (re)built, a merit it will be for you before YHW the God of 28Heaven (more) than a person who will offer him burnt-offering and sacrifices (whose) worth is as the worth of silver, 1 thousand talents, and about gold. About this 29we have sent (and) informed (you). Addendum I Moreover, all the(se) things in a letter we sent in our name to Delaiah and Shelemiah, sons of Sanballat, governor of Samaria. Addendum II 30Moreover, about this which was done to us, all of it, Arsames did not know. Date On the 20th of Marcheshvan, year 17 of Darius the king.

4. The account of the destruction affords a glance at the configuration of the temple—pillars and five gateways of stone, pivots of bronze, roof of cedar, and basins of gold and silver. A not unimpressive structure. 5. As double justification for the presence of the Jewish temple, Jedaniah asserts that it existed during the days of the native Saite monarchs and was not destroyed by the Persian conqueror Cambyses. 6. Fasting and mourning for the destruction of the temple, the Jews saw their prayers for the downfall of Vidranga and his coconspirators answered,3 but authority to reconstruct the temple was not forthcoming and appeals to the several authorities in Jerusalem to intercede on their behalf went unanswered. 7. Fasting and mourning continued and the temple sacrificial cult (hwl[w hnwbl hjnm) had ceased functioning. 8. New appeals to Bagavahya in Jerusalem and to the sons of Sanballat in Samaria were undertaken, this time also in the name of “the Jews, all (of them) citizens of Elephantine” (by yl[b), with promises of spiritual rewards if their pleas were answered.
In a word, the Jews had a full-fledged temple, built under Pharaonic rule, confirmed by the Persian conqueror Cambyses in 525, destroyed in 410 by the local Egyptian priests in collusion with the Persian governor, and remained unrestored while the Jews appealed to their homeland to get it rebuilt. The Sachau Papyri contained two documents that further defined the nature of the Jewish community: the Passover Letter (TAD A4.1) and the Collection Account (TAD C3.15). Each referred to it as alyj aydwhy ‘the Jewish troop’. It thus became clear that the Elephantine Jews constituted a military colony, divided into detachments (ˆlgd) and subdivided into centuries (twam; TAD C3.15:19–20, 31, etc.), all under the command of Persians or Babylonians. A companion garrison was known as aynknws alyj ‘the Syenian garrison’ (TAD C3.14:32) comprising, no doubt, the Arameans. The dual question thus becomes, at what point during Pharaonic rule did soldiers and priests from Judah, along with their families, migrate to Elephantine and build a temple there, and from where did the Arameans who established temples on the mainland come?

Settlement of Jews at Elephantine and Arameans at Syene 457
Prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel record an active involvement with Egypt. In a sweeping prophecy covering the lands from which the exiles would be gathered in, Isaiah cites Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Nubia (Kush), Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the coastlands (Isa 11:11).4 A tantalizing passage tells of messengers sent to the “land of winged [Nile] boats [μypnk lxlx; Driver 1968: 45] that is beyond the rivers of Nubia” (Isa 18:1–2), and two oracles relate failed embassies to Egypt proper, seeking aid from Pharaoh against the Assyrians (Isa 30:1–5, 31:1–3). Isaiah’s threefold division of Egypt and its neighbor recalls the titles that Esarhaddon took after he conquered Egypt in 671: “King of the kings of Mußur, Patures, and Kush” (ARAB, 2. no. 758). Early in his career Jeremiah rebuked the powers of Judah for wavering between détente with Egypt and with Assyria (Jer 2:18). He recounts how Jehoiakim sent a delegation led by Elnathan b. Achbor to extradite the prophet Uriah, who had fled to Egypt (Jer 26:21–23). Perhaps Troop Commander Conayahu b. Elnathan, who led a mission to Egypt on the eve of the destruction, was his son (Lachish 3:13–16). Earlier, after the exile of Jehoiachin, Jeremiah had a vision of two baskets of figs. The good figs symbolized the exiles in Babylonia; the bad figs, the remnant in Judah and those in Egypt (Jeremiah 24). After the destruction, Jeremiah was forced to join the military officer Johanan b. Kareah, with his soldiers and their families in their descent into Egypt. Their first stop was Tahpanhes, where Jeremiah prophesied in the presence of Jews (μydwhy μyçna), at the house of Pharaoh, that Nebuchadrezzar would erect his throne there and bring destruction upon Egypt. He subsequently addressed a large assembly of Jewish men and women from Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, as stated above, berated them for their worship of the Queen of Heaven, and foretold their destruction. Egypt would not be a safe haven (Jeremiah 43–44)! Already Ezekiel had condemned Zedekiah for relying on Egypt (Ezek 17:15), then castigated Egypt for failure to deliver Judah and prophesied Egypt’s destruction (Ezekiel 29–31). So here we have intense diplomatic activity in the time of Isaiah and of Jeremiah to secure the assistance of Egypt, first against Assyria and later against Babylonia. In both cases, Egyptian forces suffered defeat

For an argument on behalf of the literary unity of Isa 11:11–16 and its links with chap. 10 (places threatened in Judah [10:28–32] vis-à-vis places from which the exiles will be returned), see van Wieringen (1998: 195–96, 202). See also Irvine (1990: 288–90), who argues for the unity of 11:11–16 except for 11b and 15aa; and Kaufmann (1937: 220), who argued for the section’s Isaianic authenticity, except for v. 14.

in the land of Israel, in the time of Isaiah at Eltekeh (ANET, 287–88), probably under Tirhakah (Taharqa; Kitchen 1986: §§128–29, 346), and in the days of Jeremiah, in their efforts to relieve the Babylonian seige of Jerusalem (Jer 37:5, 11). Jewish refugees were present in Upper and Lower Egypt at the end of the eighth century and at the beginning of the sixth century. It is explicitly recorded that Jewish soldiers with their families fled there after the destruction of the Temple. The involvement with and presence in Egypt is considerable, but nothing yet that explicitly points to settlement at Aswan. For this we must probe deeper, turning both to biblical and to extrabiblical sources. There is one prophetic source that gives warranty for the establishment of a shrine in the Aswan region and that is Isa 19:19. It comes as the third of five prophecies of what will happen “on that day”
hwhyl hlwbg lxa hbxmw μyrxm ≈ra  ̊wtb hwhyl jbzm hyhy awhh μwyb
On that day there shall be an altar to the Lord inside the land of Egypt and a pillar to the Lord at its border.5
This verse was invoked by Onias IV in his appeal to Ptolemy VI Philometor to be allowed to cleanse an abandoned temple in the fortress of Leontopolis in the Heliopolitan nome “and build a temple to the Most High God in the likeness of that at Jerusalem and with the same dimensions, on behalf of you and your wife and your children, in order that the Jewish inhabitants of Egypt may be able to come together there in mutual harmony and serve your interests.” After the Maccabees gained control of the Jerusalem Temple and the high priesthood was given to Alcimus (1 Macc 7:5–25; 2 Macc 14:3–13) and not to the son of Onias III, that one fled to Egypt, was given a territory named after him (“the land of Onias”), and was placed in charge of a military contingent. Establishing a temple in this territory and appointing therein priests and Levites would give him “the eternal fame and glory” he had failed to achieve in Jerusalem (Josephus, Ant. 13.3.1, 6272).6 Here we have all the elements that may serve as an analogy for the establishment of the Elephantine temple: (1) prophetic support for
5. For an attempt to date Isaiah 18 and the first half of Isaiah 19 to the decade before Shabako’s conquest of Egypt, see Currid (1997: 232–40). For a 715 date for this conquest, see Kitchen (1986: §340). For the Isaianic authorship, see Kaufmann (1937: 226–27). 6. Gideon Bohak (1996: 27–28) and others regard this letter of appeal as a forgery from the Roman period designed to smear the Temple as impure, but except for the placename Leontopolis, which occurs nowhere else in the sources on the Temple, the other details bear historical verisimilitude and comport with what is otherwise known. On the question of the dimensions, see Bohak (1996: 29–30).

a border temple; (2) a disaffected priest, interested in establishing such a temple; (3) an Egyptian monarch ready to support such a temple; (4) the temple would unify the Egyptian Jews in support of the Egyptian monarch; (5) the temple would follow the dimensions of the Jerusalem temple and be dedicated to the Egyptian monarch; (6) the temple would be part of a military colony. A text that provides a major clue as to who this Egyptian monarch might be is Aristeas 13. Relating the origin of Jewish settlement in Egypt, the author states, “many had come into the country along with the Persian, and even before this others had been sent out as auxiliaries to fight in the army of Psammetichus against the king of the Ethopians.” Since both Psammetichus I (664–610) and II (595–589) fought the Nubians, who would have been the Judahite ruler to send them to aid the Egyptian monarch? Were he Zedekiah, the dispatch would have taken place between May/December 595, the accession of Psammetichus II, and October 593, the date of his Nubian campaign (Fontes Historium Nubiorum 1994: no. 41; Goedicke 1981: 188–90).7 In 594/593 Zedekiah journeyed to Babylon to acknowledge his allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar (Jer 51:59), and it is unlikely that he would have turned around so soon to engage in what would have been viewed as an unfriendly act. Unfortunately, the Chaldean Chronicle breaks off in the year 594 so that it is not known whether any subsequent weakening of the Babylonian regime would have encouraged Judah to revolt just then. But, since the prophet Ezekiel condemned Zedekiah for rebelling against Nebuchadnezzar by seeking troops and chariots from Pharaoh (Ezek 17:15), is it at all likely that he had troops to spare to send to Pharaoh (Sauneron and Yoyotte 1952b: 132–33)? It is conceivable that Josiah sent troops to Psammetichus sometime during the decade prior to the reform of 622, since Jeremiah castigated the people for considering an alliance with Egypt (Jer 2:18; Milgrom 1955: 65–69; Bright 1959: 295). Nothing is known of the short reign of Amon that would suggest what his policy toward Egypt might have been (Malamat 1953: 26–29). The best conjunction of circumstances appears to have been during the reign of Manasseh. He had already in 667 contributed a contingent (one of the “22 kings of the seashore, islands, and mainland”) to Ashurbanipal in his campaign against Egypt. The Assyrian monarch occupied Memphis and “made the garrisons stronger” (ANET, 294). Might

the contingent from Judah have been stationed in one of those garrisons? Three years later Psammetichus came to the throne, and Herodotus (2.30) reports that during his reign garrisons “were established” at Elephantine in the south, Daphnae in the east, and Marea in the west.8 Having been on guard for three years without relief, the Egyptian warrior class at Elephantine picked up and headed south into Nubia. Efforts by Psammetichus to persuade the “Deserters,” as they were called, to return were unsuccessful (Lloyd 1988: 126–32; Fontes Historium Nubiorum, 1. no. 56). Might not Jews have been established then to replace the fugitive Egyptian warriors? Ashurbanipal reported that Gyges of Lydia sent troops to Psammetichus, who had thrown off the Assyrian yoke (ARAB, 2. no. 785), and Herodotus (2.152–54; Lloyd 1975: 14–16; 1988: 132–39) states that they were Carians and Ionians, settled in the camps at Daphnae. In similar fashion we may imagine that it was Manasseh who sent the contingent of Jewish soldiers to man the southern fortress at Elephantine. Why would he have done this? We may take our cue from 2 Chr 33:1–13. There it states that because Manasseh disobeyed the Lord, He brought against him Assyrian officers who took him captive to Babylon. There he became penitent and was restored to his position in Jerusalem. When would the rebellion that underlies this chastisement have taken place? Some think it occurred in 671, when Esarhaddon besieged rebellious Tyre on his way toward the conquest of Egypt (ANET, 29293) and reputedly received the submission of the 22 western monarchs (Cogan 1974: 69). A more telling period would be the uprising under Ashurbanipal in the years 652–648, at the end of which the king was in Babylon, which would account for Manasseh’s being brought there (Cogan 1974: 68; Evans 1992: 498–99; Rainey 1993: 160–61; Nelson 1983: 182; Gutman 2001: 52–53; Frame 1992: chap 8). In 656 Psammetichus had consolidated his rule over Thebes, secured his western frontier by 654, and was ready to push south into Nubia (Kitchen 1986: 404–6). Seeking the backing of Egypt in his rebellion against Assyria, while it
8. “The verb is katestesan (katevsthsan), the 2nd aorist active indicative of kathistemi (kaqÇsthmi). This aorist is always used as a quasi passive in meaning, as it is intransitive. So while the present and the 1st aorist active mean ‘I set up, establish’ the 2nd means ‘was established’ even though the form is active. It means Psammetichus set up the garrisons. The verb really does mean ‘were established’ and it was in the time of Psammetichus. By itself the verb could mean the garrisons already existed, but the phrase ‘in the time of Psammetichus’ nails it down. If Herodotus meant to say the garrisons existed already in the time of Psammetichus he would have used a different verb” (Joel Farber: personal communication).



Settlement of Jews at Elephantine and Arameans at Syene 461
was occupied in the east, Manasseh sent Psammetichus a contingent of soldiers to aid him in his campaign against the king of the Ethiopians. If the Deuteronomist is relevant here, it was with Manasseh in mind that he enjoined the king not to return the people (that is, warriors) to Egypt in order to multiply horses (Deut 17:16). Soldiers for horses. But where did the Temple come from? Manasseh is best known for his paganization of the Jerusalem Temple—altars for the hosts of heaven and the sculptured image of Asherah (2 Kgs 21:5, 7).9 But he is also accused of shedding much innocent blood (2 Kgs 21:16). We may assume that his radical measures did not go down well with all the Temple priests. Some may have been killed, while others would have fled to the sanctuary of Egypt. Fortified with the decades-old prophecy of Isaiah that there will be a pillar to the Lord on Egypt’s border, they joined the Jewish garrison at Elephantine. With royal approbation they brought in cedar from Lebanon (TAD A4.7:11 || 4.8:10) and erected a temple that faced the mother country and accorded with the dimensions of the Temple they had left behind. The dimensions and orientation were worked out by me in my first published article 40 years ago (Porten 1961: 38–42) and have now been confirmed by Cornelius von Pilgrim, the current coexcavator on the site. He even claims to have uncovered traces of that very temple (von Pilgrim 1998: 485–97; 1999: 142–45). We have satisfied the push-pull requirements for migration and put forth a theory that sees the establishment of the Jewish garrison with temple at Elephantine approximately 650 b.c.e. as very similar to the establishment of the Jewish garrison with temple in the land of Onias—a disaffected priest with prophetic support entering into the service of the king and building a temple like the one in Jerusalem. So much for the Jews of Elephantine. What can we say about the Arameans in Syene? No document has survived from these Arameans comparable to the letter of the Jew Jedaniah to the authorities in his metropolis of Jerusalem. What has survived is a 22–column Aramaic text in Demotic script that concludes with an elaborate tale of the conflict between Ashurbanipal and his brother Shamashshumukin (CoS, 1.99 [Steiner]). This places us in the same historical situation in which we sought the origin of the Jewish community at Elephantine. The narrator of the papyrus relates a dream in which he is a youth in the land of Rash (X.8–13). He prays frequently to Mar, the god of Rash, for personal salvation (VI.1–12), rain (IX.1–13), the rising of the Nile
9. For this deity, see N. Wyatt, “Asherah,” DDD 99–105.



462 Bezalel Porten
(X.1–6), and social justice (IX.7–20). He laments the destruction of the country, perhaps Rash itself (V.1–11), and prays for the destruction of its enemies, the Kassites and the Elamites (X.16–20, XV.13–17). Marah of Rash is the male deity’s female counterpart and is identified with Nanai (XIII.1–9). This Rash (also called Arash) has been identified with the land of Rashu/Arashu, a mountainous region east of Deru, and perhaps south of modern Ilam, on the border of Babylonia (Zadok 1985: 259–60). It was captured in a campaign by Ashurbanipal in 647 that also included the destruction of Susa (ARAB, 2.805–10). Just as that monarch exiled Elamite Susians to the cities of Samaria (Ezra 4:910), so must he have exiled the inhabitants of Rash to that same territory (CoS, 1.99:310). Most striking is the passage that records a migration: “I come from aJoudah, my brother has been braoughto from Samaria, and now a man aiso bringaingo up my sister from Jaerousalem” (XVI.1–6). There is no time frame or topographical locus, but several items point to the Aramean settlement at Syene. (1) The deities most frequently mentioned in the text are Nabu10 (VII.1–7 [Nabu from Borsippa], VII.7–19, XIV.4–6, XV.1–9 [3x]), Bethel11 (VII.7–19, VIII.8–10 [Resident of Hamath, also VIII.3–8], VIII.10–11 and XI.11–19 [lord of Bethel], IX.1–13 [|| Mar in prayer for rain], XVI.7–19 [Horus-Bethel]), and Nanai (IVa.6, VII.1–7 [Nanai from Ayakku], XIIIXIV, XVI.7–19). Nabu and Bethel are also the deities that occur most frequently in personal names in the Egyptian Aramaic documents. While some of the Nabu names are linguistically Akkadian and therefore ethnically Babylonian (Iddinnabu, Nabua ̇bulli† [Saqqarah], Nabukaßir, Nabukudurri, Nabuzeribni, Nabusumiskun, Nabutukulti), at least a dozen are clearly Aramean (Akabnabu, Nabuakab, Nabubarech, Nabudalah, Nabudalani [Lair], Nabunathan, Naburai, Nabushaliv, Nabushillem, Nabußadak, and Nabusharah [both Saqqarah], Nabuyahab [provenance?]). All eleven Bethel names are Aramean—Bethelzabad, Bethelnadar, Bethelnuri, Bethelnathan, Bethelakab, Bethelrai, Betheltadin, Betheltakum, Bethelsagab and Bethelsharah and Bethelshezib (Saqqarah; Porten and Lund 2002). The goddess Nanai appears in three names—(Akkadian?) Nanai ̇am (TAD A2.1:1, 15, 2.2:4), Aramean Nanaishuri (TAD B4.7:1), and Nanai (TAD B1.1:16).
10. For discussion of this deity, see A. R. Millard, “Nabû,” DDD 607–10. He was particularly popular among the Aramaic-speaking peoples of north Syria; see below. 11. For discussion and references outside the Amherst text, see S. Ribichini, “Baetyl,” DDD 157–59.



Settlement of Jews at Elephantine and Arameans at Syene 463
(2) The Arameans had temples to Bethel and Nabu at Syene (TAD 2.1:1, 2.3:1), and a priest of Nabu at Syene was buried at Saqqarah (TAD D18.1:1). (3) The New Year’s festival, which is the theme of the text, is held in the month of Epiph, roughly equivalent to Babylonian Marcheshvan, the eighth month, which Jeroboam instituted as the month of the fall festival in Bethel (1 Kgs 12:33). (4) In the eighth century an exiled priest from Samaria was brought back to Bethel to instruct the foreigners newly introduced into Samaria in the worship of the Israelite deity, YHWH. These people had also brought with them their own deities, Succoth-benoth (“the image of Banit”),12 Nergal,13 Ashima, and others (2 Kgs 17:24–34). As noted, there existed a temple to Banit at Syene (TAD A2.2:1, 2.4:1), and the deity appeared as a theophorous element in Aramean Makkibanit (TAD B1.1:17, etc.) and Akkadian Banitsar (TAD A2.2:5, 2.6:3, 8), Banitsrl (TAD A2.3:2), Baniteresh (TAD B2.1:19), and in Banit (TAD D20.1:1, 3). (5) The epithet for Bethel, “Resident of Hamath,” recalls the exiles from Hamath settled in Samaria who worshiped Ashima (2 Kgs 17:30),14 often related to Eshem (consequently vocalized Ashim), which appears as a divine epithet in one Akkadian name (Eshemkudurri [TAD C4.8:6]) and at least three Aramean names (Eshemzabad, Eshemram, Eshemshezib). The interrelationship of these deities is seen in the filiations Bethelzabad b. Eshemram (TAD D18:7a, 19.2:1), Eshemram b. Nabunur[i]/Nabunad[in] (TAD C4.8:8), and Nabushillem b. Bethelrai (TAD B3.9:11). (6) Several items point to the existence of a certain Jewish-Aramean symbiosis:
a. In a greeting letter, the Aramean Jar ̇u blesses the Jew Haggai in the name of Bel and Nabu, Shamash and Nergal (TAD D7.30). Bel (VII.1–7 [from Babylon], XV.9–12 [the king]) and perhaps Shamash (IVA.6–21) were among the deities in the Amherst text, while all four deities appeared in theophorous names in Egypt—Belhabeh (TAD D22.13:1 [graffito]); Shamashnuri (TAD B4.2:12; D18.16:1); and possibly Smslk (TAD A6.2:8) and Shimshai (TAD D11.7:1); the Babylonian Nergaliddin (TAD D1.33fragd:2), the Babylonian/Aramean Nergalshezib/Nergalushezib (TAD B3.9:9), and perhaps Nargi (TAD B1.1:16–17); and the numerous Nabu names cited above. Jar ̇u, himself, may be a descendant of the
12. See M. Cogan, “Sukkoth-benoth,” DDD 821–22. 13. See A. Livingstone, “Nergal,” DDD 621–22. 14. The deity has also been found among the gods of Teima; for discussion and references, see M. Cogan, “Ashima, ” DDD 105–6.

Arabians settled in Samaria by Sargon (ANET, 286 = CoS, 2.118A, 2.118H; Ephoal 1982: 105–7).15 b. The deity Eshembethel (default spelling [XV.1–9, 13–17 {Mar}]) is one of the other two Aramean deities who benefits alongside YHW from the two-shekel contributions recorded in the Collection Account (TAD C3.15:127). c. The other Aramean deity in that Account is Anathbethel (TAD C3.15:128). In Papyrus Amherst one offers sacrifices to Anath (VII.7–19); while at Elephantine Menahem takes an oath for Meshullam by AnathYHW (TAD B7.3:3);16 one Anathi is the grandfather of the contributor Mena ̇emeth, daughter of Jedaniah (TAD C3.15:11); and another Anathi is greeted in a letter sent to Syene (TAD A2.1:3). d. The goddess Anath may lie behind the epithet Queen of Heaven (tklm ˆymç), who had a temple at Syene (TAD A2.1:1; Porten 1968: 176–79; van der Toorn 1992: 97, 101 n. 67).17 In Egypt, the prophet Jeremiah castigated the Jewish fugitives, particularly the women, for their continued worship of the Queen of Heaven (Jeremiah 44). e. The authors of the Amherst Papyrus incorporated elements of Israelite Psalm 20 (XI.11–19) into their liturgy (Zevit 1990: 213–28).18 f. When their temple was destroyed, the Elephantine Jews simultaneously appealed to the satraps in Judah and Samaria for intercession (TAD A4.7:1, 29 || 4.8:1, 28). In the Amherst Papyrus, the man from Judah and the man from Samaria are brothers (XVI.1–6). g. The fact that the worship of YHWH was centered in the city of Bethel and that the Israelites hallowed a divine being associated with that place (Gen 31:13; 48:16; Jer 48:13) would have heightened the devotion of the Arameans to their god Bethel.
In addition to Rash there is evidence that points to another Aramean site from which the Arameans may have come, namely, the kingdom of Arpad, also known as Bit Agusi, in the Jebel Seman:19
15. Because of the final waw that is so prevalent in Arabian names, one is inclined to take wjry as Arabian as well, but this is not straightforward because of initial yod where waw is expected (Ran Zadok, personal communication). 16. I had argued that this deity was a Jewish composite (Porten 1968: 177); van der Toorn (1992: 94–95) argued that she was of Aramean origin. 17. For identification with Ashtoret (Astarte), see Weinfeld 1996: 522–23. For full discussion, see C. Houtman, “Queen of Heaven,” DDD 678–80. 18. M. Weinfeld (1985: 130–40) argued that Psalm 20 was a Judahite reworking of an Israelite reworking of an Aramaic original. 19. Bit Agusi was conquered and “ravaged” after a three-year seige by Tiglathpileser III in 743–740 (Tadmor 1994: 186–87) and joined the unsuccessful revolt of Ilubidi of Hamath against Sargon II in 720 (ANET, 285). The Rab-shakeh of Sennacherib is said to have challenged Hezekiah at the walls of Jerusalem in 701 with the taunt, “Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?” (2 Kgs 18:34 || Isa 36:19). For full treatment of the kingdom of Arpad, see Sader 1987: 99–152; Dion 1997: 113–36; Lipinski 2000: 195–219.



Settlement of Jews at Elephantine and Arameans at Syene 465
1. The presence there of a town named Bethel (Sefire i A 34 [KAI 222 = TSSI, 2.7]), identified variously with Beth Laha, 30 km west of Aleppo (Astour apud Lemaire and Durand 1984: 75), Kafr-Laha, 15 km southwest of Aleppo, or with Bitin on the oAfrin River (Lipinski 2000: 203). 2. The appearance in an Aramaic tablet of 570/571, probably from Sefire, of four names compounded with Bethel—Bethelasani, Betheliada, and Betheldalani (2x; KAI 227 = TSSI, 2.22; Dion 1997: 135–36). 3. Preservation of the name of the god Nabu in the name of the village Kefr Nabu, while the Jebel Seman was formerly called Jebel Nabu (Butler, Morris, and Stoever 1930: map opp. p. 60, pp. 68ff.; Butler 1908: 293ff.; Prentice 1907: 180ff.; Littmann 1934: 42ff.; Aimé-Giron 1931: 99–100). 4. The discovery at Kefr Nabu of a Greek dedicatory inscription on an oil mill, dated 224 c.e., “To Seim(i)os and Symbetylos and Leon, ancestral gods” (Prentice 1907: 180ff.; Vincent 1937: 664). Seimios has been linked to the patron deity ‡aym, to Ashima at Hamath and at Teima, and in turn to Elephantine Eshem,20 while Symbetylos can hardly be separated from Eshembethel (Lipinski 2000: 605–7). 5. Worship of Nabu during the Antonine age at Edessa and elsewhere in the Jebel Seman (Duval 1891: 228–29; Aimé-Giron 1931: 99–100) as well as at Dura-Europas (Welles, Fink, and Gilliam 1959: 61ff.).
Finally, we may turn to the Egyptian evidence, sparse as it is. Two Egyptian documents intimate that, like the Jews, the Arameans were in Egypt before the Persian conquest. The first is a stela from Elephantine of Es ̇or (Nesu ̇or), “Overseer of (the) Doors of/to (the) Southern Foreign Lands,” under Apries, biblical Hofra (Jer 44:30). He dissuaded the mercenaries on the island from fleeing to Nubia, as had an earlier garrison under Psammetichus I. In addition to the Greeks and others, there were two groups of (whom scholars dub) “Asiatics”—o·mw and Sttyw (ARE, nos. 989–95; Porten 1968: 45; Otto 1954: 162–64 [Inscription 25a]). One may refer to the Jews and the other to the Arameans. An Elephantine Demotic papyrus (Berlin P. 13615) from the end of the reign
20. For discussion of Seimios, Simios, Simia, Semea, see Ingholt 1954: 17–23; Prentice 1907: 182ff.; Aimé-Giron 1931: 113–16; Vincent 1937: 663–67. The relationship of these Greek deities to Eshem and Ashima is much debated; see Lemonnyer 1914; Milik 1967: 567–71.

of Amasis (530 b.c.e.) recorded an expedition into Upper Nubia that
included two or three Asiatic groups, rmt n Hr, rmt n Iaswr, and perhaps stm-mnt, corresponding to the earlier Sttyw (Erichsen 1941: 56–61; Capart 1943: 251–53; Sauneron and Yoyotte 1952: 205; Kienitz 1953: 129
30).21 Since three of the fourteen persons designated rmt n Iaswr bore an Egyptian name and patronym (col. vii.3, 6, 8), these persons must have arrived at least three generations earlier, that is, at the end of the seventh century (Zauzich 1992: 361–64),22 though it is not certain that they were stationed at Elephantine. In sum, then, if it is the religious element that allows us to suggest a date of approximately 650 b.c.e. for the establishment of the Jewish community at Elephantine, it is the religious element that enables us to trace the origin of the Arameans at Syene. The former are Jews who came from Judah and were in close contact with the metropolis, while the deities worshiped by the latter suggest that they arrived from distant Rash and such places as Bit Agusi and Hamath, with prior settlement in Samaria. Unlike the evidence for the Jews, however, evidence for the Arameans does not allow us to assign a date for their arrival.
21. Johnson (1999: 214–15) noted that Hr is the old term for Syria, while Iaswr is the
new term, usually rendered ‘Assyria’, but perhaps rmt Iaswr means an ‘Aramaic speaker’,
much as sh Iaswr means ‘Aramaic writing’. 22. I am grateful to Prof. Zauzich for providing me with a copy of this valuable text.

Nonbibliographical abbreviations are atyp. = atypical, desc. = descendant; and WSem. = West Semitic. The months are the Babylonian months. I should like to thank the trustees of the British Museum and Mr. C. B. F. Walker for permission to quote from unpublished BM tablets and to consult the Bertin copies (henceforth Bert.), as well as Profs. P. Steinkeller, S. Cole, and P.-A. Beaulieu and the Harvard Semitic Museum for permission to quote from unpublished HSM tablets. Prof. E. V. Leichty kindly allowed me to quote unpublished tablets from the University Museum, Philadelphia (CBS, UM) and the Princeton Theological Seminary (PTS), for which I am very thankful. I also thank the Colgate Divinity School, Rochester, New York, and Prof. R. Henshaw of that institution for kind permission to quote from Crozer 203; as well as the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire, Geneva, Dr. J. Chamay, and Prof. A.

Robinson and Tammi Schneider (Claremont Graduate University, California) for permission to quote from tablets of the collection of the Institute of Antiquity and Christianity (IAC). DINGIRmes in West Semitic names is rendered il, seeing that it is most likely a pluralis maiestatis (see Zadok 1978: 31).

0. Introduction
0.1. The documentation and its relationship to the local inhabitants The number of Neo- and Late-Babylonian economic documents published (fully or partially) is no less than 20,000.1 They are mostly from “Chaldean” and early Achaemenid Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, and Uruk. Rural settlements are underrepresented. Regarding methodology, I limit my discussion to deeds as distinct from administrative records. The simple criterion, namely the presence of witnesses is not applicable in very few cases. In fact only three atypical cases come to mind:
• Hi-ni-ìl (WSem.), pledge by a person of himself; the second party has Akkadian names. The document is witnessed, but its place of issue and date are not indicated (found at Ur; UET 4 203:9); • Ab-hal-la-lu4 (presumably WSem.) and Ìl-na-atano? (WSem.; Gehlken, AUWE 11, 221, 2, rev. 2; und.[“Chaldean”?]): two guarantors guarantee for Abhallu and another two for Ilnatan (concerning livestock; the text is almost complete). • Another document is neither dated nor witnessed, but a scribe is mentioned, and the protagonist (Nusku-iddina s. of Taqis-Gula) signed with his own hand (Nippur, 7 Artaxerxes II = 398/7 b.c.e., see Joannès, TÉBR 80 ad 23, 19f.). This abundant and compact documentation yields an enormous prosopographical sample: an estimate of approximately 100,000 in
1. Dandamayev (1984: 6ff.) lists 13,726 N/LB documents from the the Late Assyrian to the Arsacid period, inclusive (as of March 1983). The number 20,000 is obtained by taking into account the numerous text editions published since then as well as my acquaintance with no less than 4,000 unpublished texts in various museums and collections. These unpublished texts have basically the same chronological and geographical distribution as the pubished ones.

The Representation of Foreigners in Legal Documents 481
dividuals would not be exaggerated, keeping in mind that a typical legal deed or administrative list usually contains the names of at least five nonrecurrent individuals.
The importance of this huge corpus for reconstructing the structure of the Babylonian society cannot be overestimated. However, as I have already shown (Zadok 1995b), this extremely rich documentation consists almost exclusively of the archive owners (protagonists), the other parties (principals) to the transactions, and their circle (mostly witnesses), with a mandatory overrepresentation of notaries-scribes.2 Almost all of these individuals were Babylonian urbanites. The sample does not adequately represent all the important ethnolinguistic groups in Babylonia: no more than two percent of the individuals mentioned in private archives bore foreign names and/or had blood relatives with such names. The only exception is the Murasû archive, which covers Nippur and its countryside, but consists of no more than five percent of the pertinent Neo/Late-Babylonian (henceforth N/LB) documentation. The material from this rather atypical archive is not discussed below (except for the endorsements in 6). Contrary to the other private archives, that of Murasû has an exceptionally fair representation of non-Babylonians. This is the reason that most of the Judeans that we know about in pre-Hellenistic Babylonia are recorded in the Murasû archive. I have long suspected that this may be just an accident of documentation, and it does not necessarily mean that their largest concentration was in the Nippur region. This somewhat one-sided picture is about to change with the forthcoming publication of more documents from uruIa-a-hu-du and other settlements in the Babylon-Borsippa region. The Babylonian urbanites, or more precisely, the urbanite elite, consisted of free citizens (mar-banê). Their means of identification is their affiliation with clans. Each of them is mentioned in the sources, not only together with his father’s name, but also with his surname (see Garelli 1969: 161f.; cf. Joannès, TÉBR 203f.), that is, the name of his clan (generally formulated as PN1 A-sú sá PN2 A PN3; PN1 = given name, PN2 = father’s name, and PN3 = surname). These surnames were current as early as the very end of the second millennium / beginning of the first millennium b.c.e. (see Lambert 1957; Zadok 1995b; 1996: 598), but they do not seem to have been crystallized finally before the ninth century b.c.e., if the existence of the surname Ar/Ár-ba-A+A, that is, ‘Arabian’ is any indication: based on what we know, Arabians are not

mentioned in any source before the middle of the ninth century b.c.e. Therefore, it seems improbable that this surname, which refers to a Urukean clan (recorded in 603/2 and 552/1 b.c.e.3), was coined before that time. The urbanite elite was generally Babylonian and was the main bearer of the Babylonian culture and the backbone of the socalled civic-temple community, but this does not mean that the community did not absorb foreigners up to a certain date. Not only does the just-mentioned clan, Arbayu, point to a foreign extraction but also Suhayu ‘Suhean’ (a region that had always been under Babylonian cultural influence), Su-a-ti-ia/Si-(a)-ti-ia/Su-ti-ia4 ‘Sutean’ (= West Semitic seminomad), as well as several Kassite surnames, such as Sá-ga-e-ri-ia5 and Sá-am-ba-a/Sá-ab-ba-a,6 and other non-Akkadian surnames (e.g., Ia-ru-ru,7 Sag-di-di/ti,8 Ba/Bi-hi-ri,9 Ab/p-sa-en-na,10 and Su-bar-ma

The Kassite royal name Ku-ri-gal-zu was in use among commoners in first-millennium Babylonia (e.g., TuM 2/3, 30b, with references) as was the Old Babylonian (< Amorite) royal name Ha-mu-ra-b/pu (desc. of Eppes-ili, witness; Babylon, 18.XI.662/1 b.c.e.; VAS 4 2:6). 7.

na11). The case of the clan of Mißirayu ‘Egyptian’ is more complicated, because the earliest member of this important clan is mentioned as early as the reign of Nabû-suma-iskun (ca. 760–748 b.c.e., Zadok 1997a), almost one hundred years before Esarhaddon’s conquest of Egypt, which resulted in massive deportations of Egyptians to Mesopotamia. The statement of van de Mieroop (1997: 108) that several Chaldean and Aramean groups integrated themselves within the southern Babylonian cities is too general: such an integration seems unthinkable after the late Assyrian period. Van de Mieroop (1997: 1078) cautiously considers the possibility that descent was not the determining factor for membership in the urbanite clans. However, such a possibility is not supported by any hard facts: the rich documentation, rather, suggests a separation between prebendary and nonprebendary craftsmen (cf. Bongenaar 1997: 140ff., 299). The issue of acculturation and assimilation can only be touched upon here. The nonassimilating tendencies and even a certain degree of segregation of the Babylonian society are discernible. A case in point is the fact that the Babylonians, unlike the Assyrians, neither conducted mass deportations (cf. Ephoal 1989: 36f.) nor aimed at a total integration of foreigners within the Babylonian society. Recorded cases of intermarriage between Baylonian urbanites and foreigners are rare. Mixed marriages between the long-established and culturally influential Babylonian urbanites and foreigners were in one direction: the Babylonians would marry alien wives, but they did not give their daughters in marriage to non-Babylonians. We would expect Babylonians, who were the influential group in their country, to marry accultured foreign wives, but we would hardly expect urbanite Babylonians to give their own daughters in marriage to foreign commoners. As I have just pointed out, the huge documentation represents almost exclusively (over 97%) the archive owners and their circle, who were basically urbanite Babylonians. The temple archives also record

Other surnames that are not straightforward Akkadian are Adad(dISKUR)-ra-mu (ancestor of Gimillu s. of Nabû-zera-iqisa, first witness out of two, both with surnames; Uruk, YOS 7 37:13), Adad(dISKUR)-ra-ma (ancestor of Inninsuma-eres s. of Bel-suma-ukin? UCP 9/1, II, 24); Za-ka-ri-Adad(dISKUR), ancestor of Sîn-suma-ußur, son of Samas-ekal-usezib, scribe, 4(?).XII.624/3 b.c.e.; UET 4 62:10); and Sîn(dXXX)-qu-na (ancestor of Nabû-belsunu s. of [DN]-GÁL-SE[S], first witness out of five, Ka-ab-[bar?]-tu4, 17(?).-.561/0 b.c.e.; GCCI 2 95:13). Ba-ri-hi (e.g., Ellis 1984: 46: 9, 30) is perhaps Akkadian. SB from the NA period has ba-ri-hi ‘shining (stone)’ < ‘translucent’ (see CAD B 110b). The surname Sag-gi4-ia (YOS 17 6:20, Kar-Eanna, 584/3 b.c.e.) is to be read Sag-gil-ia.

no more than approximately 2–4% non-Babylonians. The reason for the underrepresentation of foreigners in N/LB documents is that cuneiform writing was confined to the urbanite Babylonians, who can be easily identified due to the fact that all of them bore surnames in addition to their Akkadian names and Akkadian fathers’ names (a case in point is the rab-banê in the Ebabarra archive, who bear Akkadian names, the majority having surnames; Jursa 1995: 75ff.). Only the individuals who belonged to this system of clans were considered “indigenous” Babylonians. This also applies to the just seventeen individuals bearing foreign names who belonged to the group who used the system of surnames (see 0.2 below).12
0.2. Exceptions: Bearers of Foreign (Mostly West Semitic) Names of Males within the System of Surnames

12. More cases that need clarification are: Iqisa s. of Gi-lu-auo-a (non-Sem.) desc. of Sîn-sadunu, creditor, Babylon, 9.XIIb.560/59 b.c.e. (Sack, Nergl, 9, 1f.; Egibi archive). Ú-ku-mu is presumably non-Semitic rather than West Semitic ‘black’ (Zadok 1978: 137, 337), because Aram. (OSyr.) actually has aukkama: Ú-ku-mu (f. of Ina-†esî-e†er first witness out of six, Uruk, 624/3 b.c.e., Knopf 1931: 124, 9), Sadunu, son of Ú-kum-mu, desc. of [. . .], first witness, Uruk, 28.IV.616/5 (TCL 12 18:11)–28.II.601/0 b.c.e. (YOS 17 191:4); Nabû-e†er s. of Ú-ku-mu desc. of É-kur-za-kir, owner of real estate near the Gu-za-ru canal in the Uruk region, Babylon, 539/8 b.c.e. (Dillard 1975: FLP 1533, 6f.; cf. 1607). Allegedly non-Akkadian names within the system of surnames are Am-mi-ìl (mistake for Ammeni-il? f. of Bel-iqbi desc. of Hanab, Uruk, 24.VIII.588/7 b.c.e.; YOS 7 2:31); Su-KUru (not -qu-!; recte Ku-dur-ru f. of Sa-Nabû-su, desc. of Paharu, Babylon, 11.VI.555/4 b.c.e.; Rutten 1947: 100f., 21). Is Ta-at-ti-di s. of Iqupu desc. of Egibi a foreign name? The context and milieu are not in favor of a foreign derivation. fA-ha-ta-a fsa-gi-it-tu4, (Scheil 1915: 1f., 4) and Pu-di-ia (YOS 7 189:4, 9) are either West Semitic or Akkadian. Another Pu-di-ia is listed among the prebendary oil-pressers of Ebabbarra, who all bear Akkadian names and surnames; also fBu-a-i-tu and fBu-sa-sa have surnames (Bongenaar 1997: 281, 465). The latter is atypical like fBi-is-sa-a, Ba-zu-zu (cf. Streck 2001: 116) and Ba-assi-ia (Sarkisian 1955: 144: II 31, 5).

Nabû-iddina s. of Na-d/tan-nu (WSem.) desc. of Nappahu, first witness out of two (the second one and his father bear Akkadian names and a surname); Borsippa, 29.IV.518/7 b.c.e. (BM 29087, 11f.); 13.

Both are defined as mar-banê ‘free citizens’ in Babylon, 18.VI.511/0 b.c.e.; all the other free citizens (and their fathers) in this list bear Akkadian names and surnames (VAS 6 127). Sulluma is also the first witness out of five (all with Akkadian anthroponyms, such fathers’ names and surnames) on 7.XII.510/9 b.c.e. (Babylon; VAS 6 129); 15. D/†a-hu-ú-a s. of Di-hu-um-mu (both WSem., see Streck 2001: 116f.) desc. of Eppesili, fourth witness (out of seven); Alu-sa-Zumba (possibly near Babylon), 20.XI. 508/7 b.c.e. (Dar. 392, 21). 16. Sîn-ibni s. of Ba-di-ìl (WSem.) desc. of Si-†u-kan¢(?); Kish, 25.VI.503/2 b.c.e. (BE 8 113:4); 17. Samas-e†er s. of Ina-qibit-Anu was the grandson of S/Sib-qát-Anu(dDIS) (WSem.) desc. of Ekur-zakir in Hellenistic Uruk (21.-.193/2 b.c.e.; Wallenfels 1998: 34, 168: 6, 29: “Sibqat-Anu”).
It seems that the attitude regarding naming of females was somewhat more lenient and “open”: a certain fGu-zu-um-ma-a was the sister of the scribe Nabû-sarra-ußur s. of Nabû-ahhe-sullim (Uruk, 20.II. 561/0 b.c.e.; AnOr 8 11 = BR 6 14:13). The only member of the Murasû clan bearing a non-Akkadian name was a female (Naqqitu, WSem.). fHa-na-si (WSem.) has an Akkadian filiation (with surname), Borsippa, 22(?). IV.550/49 b.c.e. (VAS 5 25:6, 9, 1). It should be pointed out that, although a high degree of precision is attained, there are still cases in which the distinction between Babylonian (practically non-Assyrian Akkadian) names and West Semitic ones is not clear-cut.13 In addition, there might have been cases where

the same individual had a West Semitic alias in addition to his Akkadian name: Kin-zeri, the father of the Babylonian pretender NidintiBel, in the Babylonian version of the Bisutun inscription (von Voigtlander 1978: 19: 31) is named Ha-a-na-a-ra in Elamite and Aina[ira]hya (gen.) in Old Persian (presumably WSem. *Ay-ner(i) or sim.). The Babylonian version, which occasionally has more details on Babylonian matters than the other versions, is the only source for Nidinti-Bel’s title, viz., zazakku (cf. Zadok 1981: 661f.).
0.3. More- and Less-Prestigious Groups It must be clear from the outset that the urbanite elite was not necessarily identical with the political ruling class. The leading political force in first-millennium Babylonia were the Chaldean14 and Aramean tribesmen rather than the Babylonian urbanites. Is it incidental that one of the Babylonian pretenders in the Achaemenid period has no surname (cf. above, 0.2 in fine) and another one is defined as an Armenian? Royal officials, such as inspectors of temples and the chief com

mercial agent of the Neo-Babylonian court, bore West Semitic,15 including Phoenician, names.16 At least fifteen individuals with foreign names or relatives of such individuals (all mentioned in N/LB deeds) bore names with the component sarru ‘king’, an indication that they (1.1.1.3.1, 58; 1.1.1.3.2, 14, 3.1.1.2.5, 1, 3.1.3, 3, 6, 3.1.7.1.2, 2, 3.1.29.1, 2, 3.1.34.1.1, 2 below; explicitly defined as a royal official: 1.1.2.1.2.1, 4) or their fathers (1.1.2.2.10.3, 2.4.4, 5 below) served in the palatial sector or were presumably transferred from that sector to a temple (1.1.1.3.1, 36). This list would not be complete without mentioning Milkumu-sarraußur, Kamusu-sarra-ußur (1.1.2.2.4.5, 1.1.2.2.4.9 [paternal name]), both apparently with Transjordanian connections, as well as two individuals who were in all probability Judeans, viz., dIa-hu-ú-sarra(LUGAL)ußur(URÙ) s. of Samas-iddina and Sá-ab-ba-ta-A+A s. of Nabû-sarrabulli†. They witnessed two deeds that were issued in Susa. dIa-hu-úsarra-ußur is recorded on 18.I.494/3 b.c.e. (the deed belongs to the Babylonian archive of Egibi; both parties are Babylonian, and the debt is to be paid in Babylon; OECT 10 152:15), whereas Sá-ab-ba-ta-A+A is mentioned on 6.XII.493/2 b.c.e. (VS 6 155:17; both parties are Borsippean). It is noteworthy that both appear in Susa, the Achaemenid capital where Nehemiah served as a royal official in the late Achaemenid period. The Achaemenids employed both Babylonian and nonBabylonian functionaries in Babylonia and adjacent regions. It stands to reason that under certain circumstances the authorities might have regarded the nonindigenous functionaries more reliable than the Babylonian ones, who might have possessed a particularistic potential. The most conservative sector among the Babylonian urbanites is that of the Babylonian scribes (sg. †upsarru as distinct from the alphabet scribes, sg. sepiru). Except for one case (an Elamite writing a tablet for his own people, who came from a country with a very long tradition of

The inspector (qipu) of Sippar did not belong to the local “aristocratic” families of Sippar (see Bongenaar 1997: 34), but originated—like his colleagues in other temple cities—from the men of the king (see Jursa 1997–1998: 424). Il-ta5-mís-hi-di-ri (WSem.), the inspector of Ebabbarra (Larsa, 4.XI.527/6 b.c.e.; YOS 7 156:4); Salammanu, the decurio of the inspector and the rab-sirki of Ebabbarra, and Salammare (both WSem.), the alphabetic scribe and messenger of the same inspector (Bongenaar 1997: 52f.); cf. 2.1.1 below. I do not include here the “fifty”-plot of Gup-pa-a (WSem.), which was situated on Narsarri in the Uruk region in 25.IV.611/0 b.c.e.

cuneiform writing; see Zadok 1976: 62ff.),17 all the many thousands of scribes of cuneiform documents bore Akkadian names, including one case of an Assyrian scribe18 as well as two with Aramaic fathers’ names19 and two whose grandfathers have such anthroponyms.20 It is noteworthy that the alphabet scribe is listed after the Babylonian scribes in the letter order (MacGinnis 1995: 60). The alphabet scribe is listed after the two cuneiform scribes—all three were senders of a letter order (MacGinnis 1995: 60, 61, 79, 99, 100). Out of hundreds of senders of N/LB letters, only a handful bear non-Babylonian names. Biruqa (WSem., s. of Ellil-mukin-apli), the rab-suti of Ebabbarra (see Jursa 1995: 113ff.) and the addressee of numerous letter orders (MacGinnis 1995: 105, s.v.; cf. 190), is never a sender. It should be remembered that the Babylonian elite were basically concentrated in the urban centers and were gradually confined to the temple cities, where they were, for all we know, the only prebendaries (e.g., É.DUB.BA-hu-uß-ßu s. of Kalbiya was assigned the bakers = nuhutimutu prebend of Edubba, the temple of Bel-Sa†ir, Sa†ir, 4.IX.2 Artaxerxes II = 403/2 b.c.e., TÉBR 35, passim). Only two out of hundreds of prebendaries have no surnames: Iddina-Nabû and Kußura sons of A-qa-bu-ia (WSem.), who bought the baker prebend in the

The guarantor and all four witnesses (equerries) bear Elamite names. The debt in barley is to be delivered in the measure of Mardû. The latter acted as the first witness; was he their foreman? 18. Issar-iqbi s. of Issar-iddina (Assyrian), scribe (Bongenaar 1997: 487), wrote documents of the Issar-taribi archive. 19. Mukin-zeri s. of Za-bi-da-a, Uruk, 13.V.631/0 b.c.e.

The case of Musezib-Marduk s. of Se-gus from Uruk, 12.X.7 Sin-sar-iskun (edel babi) may be different, because the linguistic affiliation of his paternal name is not transparent (hypothetically WSem., San Nicolò, BR 8/7 128 ad 71 compares Se-gu-su, Nbk. 365, 14; Cyr. 151, 12). 20. Samas-e†er s. of Ina-qibit-Anu was the grandson of S/Sib-qát-Anu(dDIS) (WSem.) desc. of Ekur-zakir (above, 0.2, 14) and Bel-bullissu s. of Bel-ana-bitisu was the grandson of Mar-da-A+A (WSem.) desc. of Mißirayu (148 b.c.e.; SBH 14 = AOAT 2, 167, 2ff.). Ninurta-apla-iskun s. of Za-bu-sú (Zbs), scribe, Nippur, 14.IX.563/2 b.c.e. (BE 8 1:27) has an unexplained father’s name. Mit-ra-a (Iran.) s. of Bel(d+EN)-[. . .] (Strassmaier 1888: 149: 10 26.31), scribe (lúSANGA/SID), is listed as the last witness, preceded by Hu-ra-a (Iran.?), who bears the same title. They did not write the tablet. The scribe of the deed was Nabû-naßir/ußur (PAP) s. of Nabû-iddina; Babylon, 25.-.306/5 b.c.e. (see Oelsner 1971–72: 163 with n. 9; Dandamayev 1992: 100:195). Two scribes in one deed are recorded, for example, in Borsippa, 20.III.559/8 b.c.e. (VAS 4 32). It is noteworthy that the same tendency is discernible much earlier: in a sample of 61 scribes from MB Nippur, only one has an impeccable Kassite name (see Sassmannshausen 2001: 139).

E-imbi-Anu temple (Dilbat) from a descendant of Risiya (28.II.505/4 b.c.e.; VAS 5 83). The rural settlements were largely inhabited by West Semites, who also were considered free citizens there. This is amply proved by the pertinent documentation. The geographical distribution of the foreigners is typical, but with a fair coverage of the countryside: 30.31% (164 individuals) of the 960 foreigners who are mentioned in the N/LB deeds are recorded in rural settlements (see 4 below). The secluded Babylonian elite were confined to certain temple cities in the last periods of the recorded existence (the Hellenistic and early Parthian). This may be the reason why almost no cuneiform tablets from these periods were issued in rural settlements. Generally the parties of Neo- and Late-Babylonian legal documents bore Akkadian anthroponyms and fathers’ names, as well as, in many cases, surnames. There is a seemingly undefined segment, namely, the individuals bearing Akkadian anthroponyms and fathers’ names without surnames. Since their number is very large compared with the negligible share of the bearers of foreign names, they are considered here, grosso modo, Babylonian, but no decision can be reached on the level of the individual. This decision of mine to regard them collectively as Babylonians is based on a purely statistical consideration, but I deliberately avoid labeling them simply “Babylonians,” because this would be an exaggeration of the onomastic potential. In addition, we happen to know that the scribes did not always indicate the surnames. The segregation of the urbanite Babylonians can be empirically proven. The parties to the numerous transactions (recorded in approximately 10,000 deeds published so far) are mostly Babylonian. In the few N/LB transactions (no more than 200—i.e., just 2%) where one party is non-Babylonian, the other party is almost always Babylonian. Exceptions are very few. Most of the witnesses with non-Babylonian names are relegated to the end of the witnesses’ lists, unless such lists are ranked or have a special relationship to the operative sections preceding them. This is the leitmotiv of sections 1 and 3 below. Therefore, significant segments of order of witnesses, as well as important statistics, are printed below inside bold double brackets.

23. Elammu: Crozer 203 (unpubl., listed in Sigrist 1991: 28) is from uruIl-lu-um-mu, 30.IX.523/2 b.c.e. The principals are Nadna(SUMna-a) s. of Gab-ri-ia (WSem.) and Beliddina, concerning dates from the field of Nabû-ban-ahi. The deed belongs to the archive of the Eanna temple in Uruk. The Carchemish region is located well beyond the northern border of the fertile date palm. I cannot agree with Dandamayev (1999: 541; cf. Zadok 1989: 157, which apparently was not available to Dandamayev) on the identification of Elammu with the Transpotamian village near Carchemish. In my opinion, it is more likely that NB Elammu near Uruk is a colony of people from Elumu near Carchemish. Dandamayev (1999: 544) admits that “It cannot, however, be excluded the possibility that the documents under consideration were drawn up at a village near Uruk named after Elammu in Syria,” but several lines later he states: “It is, however, unlikely that a settlement in the Uruk region is meant in the documents under discussion.” However, Dandamayev himself does not conceal that there may be one prosopographical link between Elammu and the documentation from the Uruk region: Innina-ahhe-iddina s. of Nabû-sutur desc. of Hunzû, a witness in FLP 1607, 10 (549 b.c.e.) and in an Uruk document from 536 b.c.e.; Dandamayev rejects the identity of Kina s. of Nabû-balassuiqbi (FLP 1582, 10 from 548 b.c.e.) with Kina s. of Nabû-balassu-iqbi desc. of Mandidu from the reigns of Nabonidus and Cyrus (Kümmel 1979: 154).

3. Witnesses (447)
3.0. Introduction (cf. von Dassow 1999) A high official is listed as the first witness in ranked witness lists: the royal official A+A-i-ga-a-si (2.1.1, 2 above) is followed by six witnesses, all with Akkadian anthroponyms, as well as Akkadian fathers’ names and surnames; 10.XII.552/1 b.c.e. (YOS 6 64:1; cf. YOS 6 40:23 from 23.VI.553/2 b.c.e.). He appears second in a list of witnessing free citizens (the other three and their fathers bear Akkadian names); 16.VIII.546/5 b.c.e. (YOS 6 131:2). He explicitly precedes the witnesses in the list (in the presence of A.) and then lúmukinni, who consist of five witnesses (four have Akkadian anthroponyms, as well as Akkadian

fathers’ names and surnames, and the last one and his father bear Akkadian names; YOS 6 206:14). A deed was drafted in the presence (ina usuzzu) of the commissioner of Eanna and A+A-i-ga-a-sú. Then follows the witness list (five with Akkadian anthroponyms, as well as Akkadian fathers’ names and surnames); 12.–.– Nbn. (YOS 19 66:14). Another ranked witness list is arranged as follows: (1) governor (sakinmati), (2) chief slaughterer, (3) Nabê(d+AGe)-na-ta-nu, governor of É AD, (4) rab-unqati, (5) rab-kißir, (6) Bit(dÉ)-ìl-da-la-a-an, rab-zabbu, (78) individuals without titles, (9) governor (sakin †emi) of Uruk, and (10) royal official; Larsa, 28.I.555/4 b.c.e. (TÉBR 37 = YOS 6 11; see below, 3.1.31). Before the witness list: in the presence (ina usuzzu) of Il-ta[5mís-hi-di-ri], the inspector (qipu) of Ebabarra of Larsa; Sa†iru, 4.XI. time of Cambyses (sometime between 529 and 522 b.c.e.; BIN 2 108:11). The first witness is the chief administrator (satammu) of the Ezida temple of Borsippa, followed by the chief administrator of Eanna, and the commissioner of Eanna (third). The only witness with a West Semitic paternal name is Adad-ú-se-zib s. of Sa-mi-ku, herdsman (naqidu, 4.V. 538/7–23.VI.525/4 b.c.e.), the last (eighth) witness; Uruk, 4(?).V.539/8 b.c.e. (TCL 12 119:25; cf. TCL 13 171:36). A+A-áh(SES)-nu (WSem.) is the last witness in a “protocol.” He is preceded by six witnesses, all with Akkadian names (some with paternal names that are also Akkad.); place unknown, undated (VAS 6 253:12). Samas(dUTU)la-ma-a s. of Su-ub-ba-du (WSem.) is listed in the fourth place; most of the preceding elders bear Akkadian names, several with surnames; probably Sippar (prosopographically connected with Cyr. 328 from Sippar), 30.XII.531/0 b.c.e. (Cyr. 329, 7; see Kohler and Peiser, Rechtsl. 2, 78f.). A man with an Akkadian name and an Akkadian father’s name is listed as the last witness after several witnesses bearing surnames—we happen to know from other sources that he was an alphabet scribe (Sippar, —.VIII. 523/2 b.c.e.; see MacGinnis 1998: 328; cf. 325f.).

One suspects that it is a [[ranked]] witnesses list because of the presence of Iranians, the more so since one of the neighbors mentioned in the transaction which involves pledge of a real estate, has a non-Semitic name; cf. above, 2.3, 23.

4. Summary
Only 420 individuals with non-Akkadian anthroponyms and fathers’ names acted as principals in Neo- and Late Babylonian deeds. The individuals belonging to the other parties of these transactions always bear Akkadian anthroponyms and fathers’ names and in many cases also surnames. For the sake of completeness, I include not only foreigners acting as principals but also other such individuals mentioned in the operative sections of deeds. The documentary distribution is as follows: altogether 960 individuals with non-Babylonian names (out of over 50,000 individuals in deeds, i.e., less than 2%), out of which 420 acted as principals. Another 93 individuals are also mentioned in the operative section (altogether 513 in the operative section). 447 individuals played the passive role of witness. Geographical distribution (roughly from north to south):
Sippar: 63 Baß: 4 Upi: 13 Babylon: 200 Kish (Hursag-kalamma): 27 Borsippa: 39 Dilbat: 4 Nippur: 40 Sa†ir: 5 Uruk: 159 Larsa: 17 Ur: 20 Susan: 4
Total of urban centers: 595 (61.97%) Rural settlements: 164 (30.31%) Provenience unknown: 201 (20.93%)

In only 20 out of over 10,000 of Neo- and Late Babylonian deeds are all the principals non-Babylonian (48, i.e., just 11.42% out of the 420 nonBabylonian principals). These exceptions are mostly slave sales and bail documents. As was demonstrated by Stolper (1989: 85), the seller had to clear the conveyance of those slaves to the buyer through the royal tax office in the late Achaemenid period. In all probability this office accepted both cuneiform and Aramaic deeds, but apparently in certain cases the office and the parties preferred to record these important transactions on the more durable cuneiform tablets. This applies at least to seven individuals (above, 1.2.1.4; cf. 1.2.2, 1–4). The alphabetic scripts of the Arabians were different from those of the Arameans. The ancient North Arabian scripts, notably Safaitic and probably Thamudic, were not used for administrative and other useful functions. We know this because they are the product of a nonliterate society of nomadic pastoralists (see Macdonald 1989: 68–69). Therefore, it is not surprising that the 5 ± 4 individuals with Arabian names (above, 1.2.1.1, 1.2.1.2) preferred to record their slave sales on cuneiform tablets rather than in Aramaic deeds. Other remarkable exceptions are marriage contracts of Egyptians from Babylon and Susa (see Joannès 1984 and Abraham 1992). It stands to reason that Egyptians, as foreigners who were not attracted by any of the two Semitic writing traditions, had the choice to employ the services of either Aramaic or cuneiform scribes (see above, 1.2.3.1). 1.2.2, 6–7 perhaps belonged to the palatial sector, if they had a relationship to the royal merchant, who acted as the first witness. The absence of Babylonian parties in several tablets from Nerab, which is outside Babylonia (in northern Syria), is understandable. Concerning the few deeds from Babylonia with no discernible Babylonian party (above, 1.2.1.3, 1.2.3.2, 3), we cannot exclude the possibility that—like the archive of Belsunu (Belesys)—the servants acted in lieu of their master. This resembles the situation in the Murasû archive, in which many agents were involved in the transactions of their master. Does the tablet UCP 9/1, II, 38, where six individuals are listed (above, 1.2.3.2, 4–9), belong to the Eanna archive, as do most tablets of the same edition? The group mentioned in Brinkman 1989 (1.1.2.2.4.1) lived in the first half of the eighth century b.c.e.—that is, several decades before the appearance of Aramaic script on Babylonian soil. The remaining 351 (83.57%) foreigners had a Babylonian party. For 20 foreigners (4.76%; above, 1.3, 1.4) the other party is perhaps Babylonian, or the names of the other principals are not preserved.

Almost all of the thousands of witnesses in this huge corpus of deeds are Babylonian. Most (238/447 = 53.24%) of the few non-Babylonian witnesses are relegated to the end of the lists of witnesses of the deeds,36 another indication of the exclusiveness of the urbanite Babylonian society. But this is just a minimum based on the apparent cases. If one excludes the first witnesses from the statistics (9 ± 8 second ones, mostly in rural settlements, where the witness lists are often very short, consisting of two or three individuals) and those appearing in ranked37 witness lists or having a special relationship with individuals mentioned in the operative section (altogether 10 + 7 + 8 + 7 = 25). There are more or less clear cases of ranked lists in which the last four witnesses are servants of the same master. The Persian witness Ahseti is listed right after the high officials of the temple of Dilbat and before eight witnesses of the Dilbatean elite. In one case, the appearance of Iranian witnesses may be linked to the presence of a neighbor with a non-Semitic name, perhaps Iranian, in the operative section. After all, the Babylonian scribes, who arranged the ranked witness lists, were not masters of ceremonies. It is noteworthy that a non-Babylonian judge was also placed at the end of the list of judges: [. . .]-ari/hu?o-ri dayyan E-la-mu-ú (the Elamite judge) is listed as the last of three judges (the first two judges have Akkadian surnames!) and before [Nabû]-nadin-ahi (s. of E†eru), the uppadetu official (Roth 1991: 33 n. 41: Rm 681 = Bert. 2708, 20). Moreover, in most cases, the witnesses with Akkadian anthroponyms and fathers’ names, who follow the foreign names, do not have surnames. Typically, almost no surnames are encountered among wit
36. The distribution of the pertinent witnesses is as follows:
last: 129 practically last: 13 last?: 9 last/last but one: 2 Grand total of last: 153
last but one: 80 practically last but one: 4 practically last but one?: 1 Grand total of last but one: 85
37. Ranked 7, presumably ranked 3, and questionably ranked 4 (ends with four servants of the same master). In one case, the appearance of Iranian witnesses may be linked with the presence of a neighbor with a non-Semitic name, perhaps Iranian, in the operative section (3). The Persian witness Ahseti is listed right after the high officials of the temple of Dilbat and before 8 witnesses of the Dilbatean elite. Seven witnesses have a special relationship of the witnesses with the principals in the operative section.

nesses from rural settlements. Therefore, there is some reason to suspect that at least some of these witnesses are accultured foreigners. If this proves true, then the overwhelming majority of the foreign witnesses are at the end of the lists. To sum up, in relative terms foreigners are poorly represented in the Neo- and Late Babylonian deeds, but their absolute number and distribution is (due to the magnificent size of the general sample) much larger than in any primary source from the ancient Near East. It should be remembered that, in addition to the 960 individuals mentioned in deeds, there are at least 672 in N/LB administrative records and 57 in letters and letter orders. Altogether there are no less than 2,500 N/LB individuals with foreign names if one takes into account the Murasû archive.
5. Appendix 1: Individuals Bearing Non-Babylonian Names Mentioned in N/LB Deeds Issued Outside Babylonia (Except for Susa)
5.1.1.3.15.1. Persepolis: both parties are Babylonian (Stolper 1984).
5.1.1.3.15.2. Hidalu (6.XIIb.653 b.c.e., Leichty 1983) all the individuals and their fathers bear Akkadian names, except for Ul-da-ga who presumably was of Babylonian extraction as well in view of his father’s name Ina-tesî-e†er (line 18).
5.1.1.3.15.3. Bit-Hu-lum-mu (“probably no further east than Khuzistan”), 2.XI.2 Hallusu (707/6 or 698/7 b.c.e.), all the individuals and their fathers have Akkadian name s (no surnames, see Stolper 1986: 238f.); an orchard in Ú-bullu4 (of) dKa-ni-sur-ra38 is pledged.
5.1.1.3.15.4. Sumundanas (Sumuntunas), 15.XII.15 Hallusu (beginning of the seventh century b.c.e.), all the individuals and their fathers bear Akkadian names (see Weisberg 1984: 213ff., esp. 215).
5.1.1.3.15.5. Humadesu (in Persis). Contrary to the other non-Babylonian sites, many of the individuals from Humadesu bear foreign (mostly Iranian) names (see Zadok 1976: 70f.). In one of the documents, all the individuals (two principals and four witnesses; 17.X.7th year, presumably of Cambyses, in which case it can be dated to 523/2 b.c.e.; Pinches 1891) have Iranian names (mostly with Iranian filiation), except for one of the parties whose father’s name is Akkadian. Oddly enough, the name of the scribe is not indicated.
5.1.1.3.15.6. Ecbatana. Most principals are Babylonian (Dandamayev 1986). One deed belongs to the Tattannu archive.
38. Ubullu: Presumably a settlement; the addition of a divine name to its name (cf. dka-ni-su-ra; see D. O. Edzard, RlA 5, 389; Krebernik 1985: 27) is probably in order to distinguish it from homonymous settlements; cf. dKa-ni-sur-ra* (the copy looks like UM)-ri-sat, GCCI 2 142:1).

6. Appendix II: The Distribution of the Aramaic Argillary Endorsements in “Chaldean” and Achaemenid Babylonia Compared with Those of the Exclusively Cuneiform Documents39
6.0. Introduction In Babylonia, unlike Upper Mesopotamia, there are very few purely Aramaic documents written on clay (at best two or three: Fales 1978 and Müller-Kessler 1998; KAI 227 [34 Nbk. II = 571/0 b.c.e.] is perhaps from Sfire in Syria) and only short Aramaic endorsements on tablets with longer Akkadian texts. “Endorsements” here are synonymous with other terms, such as “dockets,“ “notes,” and “notations.“ The comparison that I shall make here is between two uneven corpora. I shall start with the much larger corpus, the purely cuneiform one. Regarding the scope, this comparison is confined to economic documents: legal, administrative, and epistolary. The sizable corpus of 20,000 N/LB tablets with economic contents serves as a basis for comparison with other corpora of different scripts stemming from “Chaldean” and early Achaemenid Babylonia. However, the usefulness of the other corpora, the two Aramaic ostraca from Nippur and Larsa and the notations in an unknown script on a tablet from Babylon, is negligible.40
39. The gist of this section was delivered as a lecture at the second conference on Aramaic argillary texts (Tübingen, 20.3.1999). 40. See Oelsner 1986: 247 (notations), 248–49; BM 47361 = 81-11-3, 66 = Pinches 1883 from Babylon, 11.XII.23 Artaxerxes (442/1 or 382/1 b.c.e., cf. Bobrinskoy 1936).



The Representation of Foreigners in Legal Documents 559
The earliest example of an Aramaic text from Babylonia is an endorsement from 728/7 b.c.e. (the Assur ostracon, which was sent from a Chaldean territory, cannot be taken into account because it is an official Assyrian document).41 Only two inscribed ostraca from Babylonia have been published (RES 957 from Nippur and Dupont-Sommer 1945–46 from Larsa, both Achaemenid). The bricks from Babylon stamped with Aramaic inscriptions are mostly unpublished and devoid of economic content. Typologically, the Aramaic endorsements on N/LB tablets can be compared with Aramaic and Greek notations on Elamite tablets from Achaemenid Persepolis. The number of the tablets bearing Aramaic endorsements or traces of them is 231 (a maximum number including questionable cases, such as 85),42 that is, slightly over 1% of the entire corpus of N/LB economic documents established above. In other words: almost 99% of the pertinent cuneiform tablets do not have Aramaic endorsements. But this statement probably does not represent the entire picture; we must remember that many, possibly even numerous tablets, had inked Aramaic endorsements that were entirely washed out.

6.2. Chronological Distribution Most of the 231 endorsements are dated or datable. The earliest endorsement is from 728/7 b.c.e. It is the only pre-“Chaldean” endorsement (Brinkman and Kennedy [1983: 23:J.20] report that the unpublished tablet YBC 7166 from Uruk, -.IV.646/5 b.c.e., also has an Aramaic endorsement). It is noteworthy that only 112 endorsements, 48.48%, are from the “Chaldean” and early Achaemenid periods (593486 b.c.e.: “Chaldean” 37, “Chaldean” or early Achaemenid 20, and early Achaemenid 55), whereas the majority of endorsements, no less than 120 (51.94%), are from the late Achaemenid and the very beginning of the Hellenistic period (116 and 4, respectively). This distribution is not in accord with that of the purely cuneiform documentation, since the overwhelming majority of the Neo- and Late Babylonian tablets are dated or datable to the “Chaldean” and early Achaemenid periods. This clearly reflects the process of partial replacement of cuneiform script by Aramaic script, a process that will be touched upon later on. On the other hand, Aramaic notations are extremely rare in Babylonia during the Hellenistic period (see McEwan 1984: 183). Is it due to the wider use of purely Aramaic texts, not only on papyrus, but also on parchments (cf. Dougherty 1928)?44

The provenience of most of the endorsements can be established. The largest group of endorsements (at least one hundred) comes from Nippur and its region. The Nergal-iddina archive, which belongs to three generations of the same family from the Nippur region, has twelve tablets. All of these tablets are with endorsements (nine are relatively well preserved: 28, 30, 31, 33, 48, 51, 54, 59, 65; see Zadok 1986: 283; cf. van der Kooij 1986: 176–77), thereby being the earliest compact group of Aramaic endorsements from Babylonia. A certain Assyrian connection is discernible here. Five endorsements were found at Neirab in northern Syria but, since they all belong to the late “Chaldean” period, they may have been issued in Babylonia, possibly near Nippur. In this case, the north Syrian and Upper Mesopotamian tradition of writing on clay in Aramaic was transplanted to central Babylonia (the Aramaic script is recorded in Upper Mesopotamia earlier than in Babylonia, and there may have been several venues of transmission of this scribal tradition from the north into Babylonia). The Sippar collection has yielded no less than 70 endorsements, but only a minority thereof are explicitly from Sippar and its region, including one from Upi. As is well known, the Sippar collection, like the Babylon collection of the British Museum, is just a cover name for tablets of different origins and much research is required in order to establish the provenience of individual tablets. Thirty-three endorsements, including 21 late Achaemenid ones, originate from Babylon and its region. One tablet from Babylon is early Hellenistic (228). The abun



The Representation of Foreigners in Legal Documents 573
dant documentation from Uruk has only 12 endorsements (cf. MüllerKessler 1998). Likewise, the ever-increasing and uninterrupted documentation from Borsippa and Kish has yielded only 4 endorsements. The numerous late Achaemenid tablets from Ur bear only 2 Aramaic endorsements. On the other hand, the handful of tablets from the Chaldean territory of Bit-Dakkuri bears 3 endorsements (79, 80, 105). They belong to the archive of Zababa-sarra-ußur s. of Nabû-zeraiddina, major domo of the crown prince’s manor (bit-ridûti). An additional endorsement was issued at Bit-reaê that may be identical to the homonymous settlement of Bit-Awkani, another Chaldean territory. On the whole, contrary to the purely cuneiform documentation, rural settlements are somewhat overrepresented in the tablets with endorsement. It should be remembered that the Babylonian elite were basically concentrated in the urban centers and have been gradually confined to the temple cities. The rural settlements were largely inhabited by West Semites (cf. above, 0.3). This is amply proved by the purely cuneiform documentation.
6.4. Archival Distribution The huge temple archives contain a negligible number of endorsements: Eanna has four (32, 34, 50, 62), Ebabbarra a handful (39 and some other texts from the Sippar collection), Esaggila perhaps two (218, 228), and Ekur has none. A more compact concentration of endorsements in the “Chaldean“–early Achaemenid period is found only in the private archive of Nergal-iddina from the Nippur countryside. Another group of endorsements from the early Achaemenid period appears in the archive of Zababa-sarra-ußur from the Chaldean territory of Bit-Dakkuri. The largest private archive (Egibi) has only one Aramaic endorsement (106), which appears on a tablet issued in BitHa-ri-ma-re-e, a small settlement with an Aramaic name, WSem., possibly G pf. 3d sing. masc. of  ̋-W/Y-R + mray as a theophorous element, that is, ‘Mray has roused himself’ (cf. Salam-mare). The most coherent documentation is from the late Achaemenid Murasû archive, which has no less than 76 endorsements of various types (see Stolper, EE, 1213 with lit.). Next comes the rather heterogeneous find from the excavations of late Achaemenid Babylon (Jakob-Rost and Freydank 1972; 21 endorsements). Unfortunately, large private archives such as Eailuta-bani and Oxherd have hardly any Aramaic endorsements.
6.5. Classification of the Tablets Bearing Endorsements Endorsements are found on documents of any type: receipts, promissory notes, contracts, and administrative records.

6.6. A Preliminary Typology of the Endorsements Themselves This typology is confined to the textual contents of the endorsements and does not take into account their external appearance and the shape of the letters. It is generally not based on collation. Badly broken texts are ignored.
6.6.1. “Attribution” or “Etiquette“ 1. s†r/awt PN or lPN (in both cases father’s name and/or title), e.g., s†r Plyh “deed (of debt) of Plyh” (140). The latter was the debtor and the tablet bears his finger nailmark. This is generally the case where we have the sequence s†r + PN (e.g., 165 and possibly 171; ± father’s name; co-debtor: 147). In the Murasû archive and other late-Achaemenid archives the tablet has either his finger nailmark (140, 144, 146, 183, 185, 194–97) or his seal (143, 191). Petitioners: 206–8 (a coherent group, same granter; mentioned with their fathers’ names); their finger nailmark is found on the tablets. Other petitioners who left their finger nailmark are 153, 155, 158, 164, 170, and presumably 168. The petitioner in 165 impressed his ring; the granter—who is presented as a copetitioner—is Ninurta-uballi† s. of Musezibu, an agent of Murasû; the seller of the female slave (29). 186–88 are administrative accounts of sheep and goats entrusted by Murasû’s agent to shepherds (see Augapfel 1917: 83). They left their nailmark (186, 188) or ring (187) on the tablets. The common denominator of the debtors and petitioners is that they constituted the other party from the point of view of the archive owner, namely the Murasû firm: in all the cases the second party is this firm, who acts in most cases through its agents. The other party deserves to be marked in Murasû’s bookkeeping. This is clearly the case of 175 (partner) and 162 (where the indication of the title renders the father’s name redundant); cf. 182. The status of 132 is unknown as the operative section is lost. 2. awt < Akkad. amatu ‘legal case’ is found only once (its occurrence in 127 and 199 is very doubtful), viz. awt aykla?] br Zora, where it is followed by the debtor’s damaged name. However, the name is fully preserved in the Akkadian text: É.AN.NA (for Ayyaki)-sulmu (79). 3. L ‘of’ in this function is followed only three times by the debtor’s or co-debtor’s name (± father’s name): lady (46), lSnal (37) and lBrkal br ˇba (105). 4. zy + PN (± father/ancestor’s name): zy Swsbl† £br¢ S[ws]£aa ̇dn, debtor (65); zy Bladn br np ̇y = debtor (107); zy Klby¢ = second (= last) witness (48); zy Tas†r (administrative, 95).

5. Given name only. PN is just short for s†r PN and is generally the debtor’s or co-debtor’s name (27, 31, 33, 39, 72, 77, 85, 107 and 87, 109 resp.; cf. 141). Occasionally the father’s name is also mentioned (49, 89). Exceptionally the creditor (36, 67, 69, 139), his representative (142) or another principal (54) are recorded. The “attribution” does not mean that in most cases the existing copy of the tablet was assigned to the individual who is mentioned in the endorsement. There are numerous examples to the contrary. For instance, s†r Sy†a (143) and all the other endorsements of the same formulation are an integral part of the Murasû archive which was found in situ. However, it should not be forgotten that a sizable number of these individuals were Murasû’s slaves whose documents might have been kept in their master’s archive. A hint that at least in one case the attribution is possible is the fact that aanowbls(?) (s†r ~, 144) was the second of four debtors. Therefore it stands to reason that the preserved copy is the one assigned to him. The same applies to the second (last) witness in 48 (zy Klby¢).

A short summary is given in 142. The most succinct summary is byt arza (Bit-Arza, 161), i.e., just the settlement where the pledged bow lands of sevral debtors were situated.

6.6.3. Short definition of the transaction The distinction between this type and the preceding one is not always clear cut, as a definition may sometimes be regarded as a short summary. PN + item of debt (52); s†r + PN + item of debt (43); s†r + PN and the definition of the transaction): e.g., s†r Zbdnna zy qna (189) “Deed of Zabid-Nanâ concerning sheep“; s†r PN (+ father) + item + quantity/sum of debt (180); s†r R ̇ymal zy tmrn krn = = (= 40 kors) (176); s†r Bladn [. . .]stydr ms ̇ krn III III (= 6) (172); PN (debtor, left his finger nailmark) + item and quantity/sum of debt (82, 118; 134 has the same formulation with zy before the item). Therefore, s†ar Pwmso zy kwr 5 (78) is—if the reading is correct—somewhat exceptional. PN1 (+ father’s name) lPN2 (127); s†r PN1 (+ father’s name, presumably petitioner) . . . lPN2 (presumably granter, 117); zy kspa zy yhb (PN1) lPN2 (88, 102); s†r zy + debt (sum only) + explicit debtor (ol PN, 81); s†[r sat] zy ol a ̇yl[d Slmbbl was(?)]rh (all brothers, petitioners, their finger nailmarks are marked on the tablet, 136); s†r + debtors (+ father = brothers) + codebtor zy rasowhm(? 133); s†r PN (+ father, debtor) zy snt n (131); Definition + PN + father: 51; zy PN + father + item and quantity/sum of debt (59); debt (item + quantity/sum)+ explicit debtor (66, ex latere debitoris); s†r [. . .] ol a ̇yl[y]—ex latere creditoris (215), more explicit in lÓny, aba, Slmd (creditors) [ol Nrglad]n (debtor; 30).
6.6.4. Direct Itemization asnyn (asne ‘Tilmun dates’, 94); abt = Akkad. abattu ‘lime(stone)’ (47).

6.7. Ethnolinguistic Affiliation of the Individuals Mentioned in the Endorsements The use of tablets bearing Aramaic endorsements was by no means confined to West Semites. In fact, in most cases it cannot be demonstrated that the parties were of West Semitic extraction. Members of almost all the major ethnolinguistic groups living in “Chaldean” and Achaemenid Babylonia acted as principals in these documents.
6.8. Ramifications: The Writers of the Endorsements (cf. Pearce 1995) The earliest recorded alphabet scribe (sepiru) is from the time of Nabopolassar (626–605 b.c.e.; Sarrani sepiru of the rab-mugi; 22.VI., the year is not preserved; to judge from his name, he may have served in the palatial sector). The earliest fully dated occurrence is from 574/5 b.c.e. An Aramaic scribe (lúUMBISAG Ar-ma-A+A, the Neo-Babylonian



The Representation of Foreigners in Legal Documents 577
equivalent of Neo-Assyrian lúA.BA Ar-ma-A+A) acted as a witness in a document (BM 29391) from Borsippa dated to Ashurbanipal (presumably from the 660s), but the witnesses are from Nineveh (see Zadok 1997b: 454–55). The occurrence of trgmna (Müller-Kessler 1998: 193) makes the traditional rendering ‘interpreter-scribe’ for sepiru unlikely; the word sepiru was an alphabet—that is, practically Aramaic, scribe. Alphabet scribes acted in various units and bodies. Only four alphabet scribes (sing. sepiru) out of 34 (Bongenaar 1997: 501–2) had West Semitic names or fathers’ names (Ab-di-mil-ki, Sá-lam-ma-re-e, IddinaBel s. of Ab-di-ia, and the Jew Ga-da-la-a-ma). Two, Kalba and Ba-zuzu, had Akkadian–West Semitic names. All the other 28 had Akkadian names, including one Assyrian (Pan-Assur-lumur). However, none of them belonged to the Babylonian elite, in view of the complete lack of surnames (cf. Jursa 1997: 118 ad 37, 11; very few are mentioned with a patronym; only one may have had a surname). Joannès (TÉBR 226 ad 55) draws attention to the mention of an alphabet scribe in a document concerning a suite of furniture from Eanna for the royal palace in Ab/manu (early Achaemenid, same time as BIN 1 95; YOS 7 86:123, 129). He points out that the royal administration conducted their correspondence and calculation on papyrus in Aramaic. Finkel (1998) published a NB school exercise (BM 25636, acquisition no. 98-2-16, 690) that is essentially a Babylonian ABC, an attempt at an Akkadian transcription of the Aramaic letter names arranged in their traditional order (this observation was made by M. Civil apud Finkel). Most of the names of the letters are given in an abbreviated form (the first syllable, the only exception being aß for Íade, presumably because za was already used as an abbreviation for Zayin), except for oAyin, the full name of which is transliterated (A+A-nu). The scribe chose bi and me and not ba, ma, which were indistinguishable in the N/LB script. This shows that the Akkadian scribes tried to become acquainted with the Aramaic script that had gradually become the dominant script in Western Asia, making communication and administration more efficient (this process was completed by the seventh century b.c.e. at the latest; Finkel [1998: 22] tentatively dates the tablet to the late seventh century). The Akkadian scribe, who had thorough training in a very complicated scribal system, probably had no difficulty in studying the much simpler alphabetic script. Finkel (1998: 22) is of the opinion that cuneiform scribes were competent in writing both Akkadian and Aramaic documents. On the other hand, the alphabet scribe had no such advantage. In addition, the average Aramaic scribe had no practical reason or motivation to study the cuneiform script, the use of which in



578 Ran Zadok
economic documents (as well as in other documents) was confined to the secluded Babylonian elite. On the whole, the increasing use of the alphabetic system of writing made communication and administration more efficient (Cole, SAAS 4, 22).
6.9. On the Importance and Contribution of the Small Corpus of the Endorsements The philological and linguistic importance of the Aramaic endorsements is obvious. They are of great help in establishing a dated/datable Aramaic paleography, throw light on early Aramaic orthography (e.g., mixed defective and plene spellings), phonology (especially the consonants in relation to the NA and N/LB ones), and lexicography. Above all, they are one of the best sources of Akkadian-Aramaic linguistic interferences. In addition, they establish the normalization of exclusively Akkadian names, such as adnnbw < Iddina-Nabû (27, 108). In exceptional cases, the Aramaic endorsements contain additional details on the genealogy or titulary of the pertinent individuals. For instance, the father of 104 has a hypocoristicon (the compound name appears in the Akkadian text). The same may apply to the father of 49. If these two cases are representative, then it seems that the scribe abbreviated the fathers’ names because the Aramaic endorsements tended to be as short as possible. 51 may have had an alias of Samasaha-iddina. The titles of 162 and 172 and the surname of 190 are recorded only in the Aramaic endorsement. The Akkadian text has only the gentilic lúAr-ba/ma-A+A, whereas the Aramaic indicates the name of the individual in question: name, Bqß (88). The mother’s name of Eriba (andblty = Amti-Beltiya) is recorded only in the Aramaic endorsement (145).
