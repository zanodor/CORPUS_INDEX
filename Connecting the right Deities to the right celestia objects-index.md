Connecting the right Deities to the right celestia objects.
The LIGHT of the Sun, Moon, Planets, Stars, Star Constellations and
the very light and crescent looking contours of the Milky Way galaxy
and it ́s luminous center, plays a great role. It is paramount to
decipher the specific light sources correctly in order to interpret the
ancient Myths of Creation and it ́s astronomical and cosmological
descriptions and explanations.
Of course our Ancestors did a lot out of following the Sun at the day
and the Stars at night. Of course the Moon and some few Planets
also was noticed. All these are of course mentioned in the
connection of LIGHT, which not should be confused with the
meaning of WHITE below.



The WHITE Milky Way Circle
The Myths of the Milky Way have long be forgotten, which is
remarkable as having the most important connection to the basically
Story of Creation. The picture above shows the most of the WHITE
circled band around the Earth, The Serpent, the Midgårds-Snake,
the Norse Mythology Heimdal Rainbow Bridge, Ouroboros etc.



In order to differ between the specifically Mythological Telling and
Symbolizing of The LIGHT of the Sun, Moon, Stars, Star
Constellations and Planets, the very words of "GIANT" and "WHITE"
are VERY SIGNIFICANT analyzing tools in order to envoy the
confusions between Sun, Moon and Planet Deities and the large
Milky Way Deities.

Basically Symbolic specifics of the Northern Hemispheres Milky

The northern hemisphere Milky Way contour/figure is fantasized and
depicted as white MALE human and animal Giant symbols or
sometime both as anthropomorphic creatures. An endless amount of
Deities, Qualities an Attributes can of course be added. Link: Links to
lots of Deities all over the World
Basically Symbolically specifics of the Southern Hemispheres

The southern hemisphere Milky Way contour/figure is fantasized and
depicted as white FEMALE human and animal Giant symbols and
sometime both as anthropomorphic creatures. An endless amount of
Deities, Qualities an Attributes can of course be added. Link: Links to

The Milky Way God and Goddess



Every cultural mythological telling contains the story of the first
deities and of the first human beings. These Star Atlas figures belong
to the basically symbols in every cultural Story of Creation in the
World. The yellow drawn spiral low on the right/woman figure is
marking the Centre of our Galaxy in the star constellation of
Sagittarius.

Wikipedia text: "Many creation myths share broadly similar themes.
Common motifs include the fractionation of the things of the world
from a primordial chaos; the separation of the Mother Goddess and
Father Fod; land emerging from an infinite and timeless ocean; or
creation ex nihilo (English: out of nothing)".
Regarding the beginning of the Norse Creation Myth, look here for
my attempt to retell this Myth in a modern and alternative way:
Myths of Creation
No further explanation are needed . . .
The Milky Way Centre Creation



Modern cosmological and astrophysical science are working with the
hypothesis that everything in our galaxy are being pulled by gravity
towards the centre of the Milky Way, but that ́s not true. Even to day
new stars are born in the centre of our Milky Way and that ́s very
consistent with the all Stories of Creation. From the galactic Womb
of the Egypt Milky Way Mother Goddess Nut above to the right, rays
of Stars and Matter are floating OUTWARDS from the Centre. This
outwards movement are also confirmed in myths telling of "milk
floating OUT from the Norse Cow Audhumbla".

The Polar Circle



Of course our Ancestors did notice the northern and southern point
of the Night Sky that seemingly not was moving. Therefore all
cultures have their special symbol for this important matter.
Imagine the above Star Atlas figure of both the northern and
southern Milky Way seemingly moving around an also seemingly
stationary Polar Point in the night Sky. The right picture here could
very well depict this situation. If one should stretch the
argumentation a little and use some fantasy, the dot in the middle
could be symbolizing the Earth, next ring of dots could represent the
Sun and it's positions in the Seasons (Could also symbolize some
Planets) and the the third ring of dots could represent the Stars
seemingly moving around the Earth.
The whole scenario on the right picture above also could tell of the 3
Norse Mythology "Garde" of Midgard, the location where your tribe



live, the second ring would then be the Asgard with the Star
Constellations and the third ring would be the Udgard with the
symbols of Giant figures which Mythological and Cosmological
belongs to the Milky Way figure, which of course are the largest
phenomenon people all over the World can observe.

The 4 spooked Wheel
The 4 spooked Wheel Circle on the Star Atlas pictures above also
belongs to the very basically Myths. The number of 4 is very
important in this part of the Story of Creation. 4 Rivers, 4 Floods and
4 Directions are often mentioned in this story. The symbol of the 4
spooked Wheel is very misinterpreted.



I don't know how someone can create the fiction that "the Sun is
pulled over the Sky on a Ship by a Horse" I've heard this impossible
statement from many mythologists and archaeologists. It's totally
impossible to observe this and therefore it is false! And
unfortunately, by the same mistake, the very 4 spooked Wheel
generally are connected to the Sun, but in fact, this 4 spooked
Wheel symbol can depict several mythological, astronomical and
cosmological meanings of directions - even as so extended to having
a Mythological meaning of the Galactic Sphere.
Cosmological Wheels within Wheels
The Day, and the Seasons, the Night Sky and the Night Sky year and
even the specific Earth directions in the Solar System and even more
as the directions regarding the localization of our Solar System
regarding the Centre of our Galaxy in the direction of the Star



Constellation of Sagittarius.
A Bronze Age Museum replica from Finland which very well could
show our Solar System and its location in our Galaxy.
"The Sun Carriage" is really a Galaxy Carriage!
Since it's totally impossible to create a fantasy-image of a Horse
pulling the Sun, this picture of the "Sun Carriage" of Trundholm,



Denmark, must symbolize something very different, and this must, in
my opinion, be another symbol of the full Milky Way Contours.
The "Sun Wheel" does NOT specifically belong to the myth of "a
horse dragging the Sun" but "dragging the Galaxy Centre. The
orange Swirl drawn on the Star Atlas to the left are marking the
Galaxy Centre.
The famous Uffingtong Landscape Horse
Big landscape Horses are found in Britain and in the Norse
Mythology Odin even have an eight legged Horse called Sleipner, a
very fast Horse who could transport Odin "all over the World". And
when symbolizing the Milky Way, the ride really went on high in the
Night Sky over the Earth.



As shown in Star Constellations Rock Art Cupmarks often depicts
Stars and Star Constellations. Stare are light, birght an white.
Cupmarks on the animal both depicts the contours of our Galaxy.
The northern Milky Way contour, symbolizing a Horse in the high
horizontal position, are really "pulling" i.e. connected to the southern
contour, and in the constellation of Sagittarius is the centre of our
Galaxy, above marked both as a Wheel and as a Circle.

The Heavenly Ship
The whole Milky Way is even mythically and biblically referred to be 1
Flood itself. Or a great Ocean on which a large Ship are sailing.
The Norse Noah Arch. In the Norse Tradition we also have the Story
of a Great Ship, called Hringhorne, which is so large that it can
contain all living beings, the Vanir, the Aser and all their equipment.
An even so, it "filled nothing more than a cloth". Ok. it depends of
course how big/small a cloth you have. But if you hold a cloth up in
straight arms in a clear winter night and point at the Milky Way, the
cloth don't have to very large in order to cover the whole view of the
Heavenly Ship . . .

But I know for a fact, that there is a big interpretative mistake going
on in the circles of Mythology and Archaeology confusing the
worshipping of a LIGHT Sun Deity and Planetary deities in stead of
worshipping the WHITE Milky Way Deities. This confusion origin of
course in a false interpretation of ancient symbols, glyphs and text.
