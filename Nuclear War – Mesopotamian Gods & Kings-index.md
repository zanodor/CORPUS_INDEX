the storms gather to strike like a flood.



(Anu, King of the Anunnaki, son & heir Enlil, Earth Colony Commander, Enki, eldest & wisest
son to Anu, Ninhursag, Anu‘s eldest daughter)
3-11 An, Enlil, Enki and Ninhursaja (Ninhursag) (2 mss. have instead: Nin
mah (Ninhursag) have decided its fate



(Sumer, land of the
gods “between the rivers” Euphrates & Tigris)
to overturn the divine powers of Sumer, to lock up the favorable reign in its
home,
to destroy the city, to destroy the house, to destroy the cattle-pen, to level the
sheepfold;
that the cattle should not stand in the pen, that the sheep should not multiply
in the fold,
that watercourses should carry brackish water, that weeds should grow
in the fertile fields,
that mourning plants should grow in the open country,
12-21 that the mother should not seek out her child, that the father should not
say “O my dear wife!”,
that the junior wife should take no joy in his embrace, that the young child
should not grow vigorous on his knee,



that the wet-nurse should not sing lullabies; to change the location of king
ship, to defile the seeking of oracles,
to take kingship away from the Land, to cast the eye of the storm on all the
land,
to obliterate the divine plans by the order of An (Anu) and Enlil;
(Anu, King of the Anunnaki giants, in his
winged sky-disc)

ble seed” law of succession)
after Nintud (Ninhursag) had scattered the creatures that she had created,
after Enki had altered the course of the Tigris and Euphrates, after Utu had
cast his curse on the roads and highways;
27-37 so as to obliterate the divine powers of Sumer, to change its preor
dained plans,
(early photo
of Ur ruins prior excavation)
to alienate the divine powers of the reign of kingship of Urim (Ur),



to humiliate the princely son in his house E-kic-nu-jal (holy of holies within
Ur ziggurat),
to break up the unity of the people of Nanna (Nannar), numerous as ewes;
to change the food offerings of Urim, the shrine of magnificent food
offerings;
that its people should no longer dwell in their quarters, that they should be
given over to live in an inimical place;
that Cimacki and Elam, the enemy, should dwell in their place;
that its shepherd, in his own palace, should be captured by the enemy,
that (King) Ibbi-Suen should be taken to the land Elam in fetters,
that from Mount Zabu on the edge of the sea to the borders of Ancan,
like a swallow that has flown from its house, he should never return to
his city;
38-46 that on the two banks of the Tigris and of the Euphrates bad weeds
should grow,
that no one should set out on the road, that no one should seek out the
highway,
that the city and its settled surroundings should be razed to ruin-mounds;
that its numerous black-headed people should be slaughtered;



that the hoe should not attack the fertile fields, that seed should not be plant
ed in the ground,
that the melody of the cowherds’ songs should not resound in the open
country,
that butter and cheese should not be made in the cattle-pen, that dung should
not be stacked on the ground,
that the shepherd should not enclose the sacred sheepfold with a fence,
that the song of the churning should not resound in the sheepfold;
47-55 to decimate the animals of the open country, to finish off all living
things,
that the four-legged creatures of Cakkan should lay no more dung on the
ground,
that the marshes should be so dry as to be full of cracks and have no new
seed,
that sickly-headed reeds should grow in the reed-beds, that they should be
covered by a stinking morass,
that there should be no new growth in the orchards, that it should all
collapse by itself
so as quickly to subdue Urim (Ur) like a roped ox, to bow its neck to the
ground:



the great charging wild bull, confident in its own strength,
the primeval city of lordship and kingship, built on sacred ground.
56-57 Its fate cannot be changed. Who can overturn it?
It is the command of An and Enlil. Who can oppose it?
58-68 An frightened the very dwellings of Sumer, the people were afraid.

facts of the giant gods & their giant mixed-breed offspring appointed to kingships, are
shamefully being destroyed by Radical Islam, attempting to hide the truth of our forgotten
past)
Ninjirsu (Ninurta) poured Sumer away like milk to the dogs.
Turmoil descended upon the Land, something that no one had ever known,
something unseen, which had no name, something that could not be
fathomed.
The lands were confused in their fear.
The god of the city turned away, its shepherd vanished.
69-78 The people, in their fear, breathed only with difficulty.
The storm immobilized them, the storm did not let them return.
There was no return for them, the time of captivity did not pass.



What did Enlil, the shepherd (Commander) of the black-headed people,
do?
Enlil, to destroy the loyal households, to decimate the loyal men,
to put the evil eye on the sons of the loyal men, on the first-born,
Enlil then (after nuclear missile attacks) sent down Gutium (ape-like prim
itives, barbarians) from the mountains.
Their advance was as the flood of Enlil that cannot be withstood.
The great wind of the countryside filled the countryside, it advanced before
them.
The extensive countryside was destroyed, no one moved about there.
79-92 The dark time was roasted by hailstones and flames.
The bright time was wiped out by a shadow.
(2 mss. add 2 lines: On that bloody day, mouths were crushed, heads were
crashed.
The storm was a harrow coming from above, the city was struck by a hoe.)
On that day, heaven rumbled, the earth trembled, the storm worked with
out respite.
Heaven was darkened, it was covered by a shadow; the mountains roared.



Utu (the Sun God) lay down at the horizon, dust passed over the mountains.

The city ...... stepped outside.
The foreigners in the city even chased away its dead.
Large trees were uprooted, the forest growth was ripped out.
The orchards were stripped of their fruit, they were cleaned of their
offshoots.
The crop drowned while it was still on the stalk, the yield of the grain
diminished.

There were corpses floating in the Euphrates, brigands roamed the roads.

The mother turned away from her child without saying “O my child!”
He who had a productive estate neglected his estate without saying “O my
estate!”
The rich man took an unfamiliar path away from his possessions.
In those days the kingship of the Land was defiled.
The tiara and crown that had been on the king’s head were both spoiled.
The lands that had followed the same path were split into disunity.
The food offerings of Urim, the shrine of magnificent food offerings, were
changed for the worse.

104-111 Its king sat immobilized in the palace, all alone.
Ibbi-Suen was sitting in anguish in the palace, all alone (last king of Ur).
In E-namtila, his place of delight, he wept bitterly.
The devastating flood was leveling everything (blasts, then nuclear fall
out).
Like a great storm it roared over the earth — who could escape it? — to de
stroy the city, to destroy the house,
so that traitors would lie on top of loyal men and the blood of traitors flow
upon loyal men.

In Urim no one went to fetch food, no one went to fetch water.
Its people rushed around like water being poured from a well.



Their strength ebbed away, they could not even go on their way.
Enlil afflicted the city with an evil famine.
He afflicted the city with that which destroys cities, that which destroys
houses.
He afflicted the city with that which cannot be withstood with weapons.
He afflicted the city with dissatisfaction and treachery.
In Urim, which was like a solitary reed, there was not even fear.
Its people, like fish being grabbed in a pond, sought to escape.
Its young and old lay spread about, no one could rise.
303-317 At the royal station (?) there was no food on top of the platform (?).
The king who used to eat marvelous food grabbed at a mere ration.
As the day grew dark, the eye of the sun was eclipsing, the people experi
enced hunger.
There was no beer in the beer-hall, there was no more malt for it.
There was no food for him in his palace, it was unsuitable to live in.
Grain did not fill his lofty storehouse, he could not save his life.

The grain-piles and granaries of Nanna held no grain.
The evening meal in the great dining hall of the gods was defiled.
Wine and syrup ceased to flow in the great dining hall.

Its food offerings could not be taken to Enlil in Nibru.
Its watercourse was empty, barges could not travel.
328-339 There were no paths on either of its banks, long grass grew there.
The reed fence of the well-stocked cattle-pen of Nanna was split open.
The reed huts were overrun, their walls were breached.



The cows and their young were captured and carried off to enemy territory.
The munzer-fed cows took an unfamiliar path in an open country that they
did not know.
Gayau, who loves cows, dropped his weapon in the dung.
Cuni-dug, who stores butter and cheese, did not store butter and cheese.
Those who are unfamiliar with butter were churning the butter.
Those who are unfamiliar with milk were curdling (?) the milk.
The sound of the churning vat did not resound in the cattle-pen.

“O father who begot me, why have you turned away from my city which was
built (?) for you?
O Enlil, why have you turned away from my Urim which was built (?) for
you?
The boat with first-fruit offerings no longer brings first-fruit offerings to the
father who begot him.



(Enlil‘s temple residence in Nippur, Command Central for all alien Anunnaki gods
stationed on Earth Colony)
Your food offerings can no longer be brought to Enlil in Nibru (Nippur,
named after their planet Nibiru).
The en priests of the countryside and city have been carried off by phantoms.
Urim, like a city raked by a hoe, is to be counted as a ruin-mound.



(mud-brick-built

The Ki-ur, Enlil‘s resting-place, has become a haunted shrine.
O Enlil, gaze upon your city, an empty wasteland.
Gaze upon your city Nibru, an empty wasteland.

(Nannar & son Utu, Nannar’s Moon Crescent symbol, &
Inanna’s 8-Pointed Star symbol)
360-370 Enlil then answered his son Suen:
“There is lamentation in the haunted city, reeds of mourning grow there.
(1 ms. adds the line: In its midst there is lamentation, reeds of mourning
grow there.)
In its midst the people pass their days in sighing.
(1 ms. adds the line: My son, the noble son ......, why do you concern your
self with crying?)
Oh Nanna, the noble son ......, why do you concern yourself with crying?
The judgment uttered by the assembly cannot be reversed.



(Anu, King of all Anunnaki on
planet Nibiru & on Earth, his son & heir Enlil)
The word of An and Enlil knows no overturning.
Urim was indeed given kingship but it was not given an eternal reign.
From time immemorial, since the Land was founded, until people multiplied,
who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence for ever?
The reign of its kingship had been long indeed but had to exhaust itself.
O my Nanna, do not exert yourself in vain, abandon your city.”
371-377 Then my king, the noble son, became distraught.



(Nannar, patron god of
Ur, & his Moon Crescent symbol, as is now with Islam; & the 8-pointed star symbol of Anu,
later given to Inanna)
Lord Acimbabbar (Nannar / Sin), the noble son, grieved.
Nanna who loves his city left his city.
(huge metropolis of Ur with Nannar‘s temple residence, home of Biblical Abraham)
Suen (Nannar) took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved Urim.



In order to go as an exile from her city to foreign territory,
(Nannar‘s spouse Ningal, mother to Inanna &
twin Utu)
Ningal quickly clothed herself and left the city.
(giant

The Anuna stepped outside of Urim.
378-388 ...... approached Urim.
The trees of Urim were sick, its reeds were sick.



(Nannar & Ningal‘s ziggurat residence in Ur, city way below, place of Biblical Abraham &
father Terah, Nannar‘s High-Priest, butler of Nannar‘s residence)
Laments sounded all along its city wall.
Daily there was slaughter before it.
Large axes were sharpened in front of Urim.
The spears, the arms of battle, were prepared.
The large bows, javelin and shield gathered together to strike.
The barbed arrows covered its outer side like a raining cloud.
Large stones, one after another, fell with great thuds.
(1 ms. adds the line: Daily the evil wind returned in the city.)



Urim, confident in its own strength, stood ready for the murderers.
Its people, oppressed by the enemy, could not withstand their weapons.
389-402 In the city, those who had not been felled by weapons succumbed to
hunger.
Hunger filled the city like water, it would not cease.
This hunger contorted people’s faces, twisted their muscles.
Its people were as if drowning in a pond, they gasped for breath.
Its king breathed heavily in his palace, all alone.
Its people dropped their weapons, their weapons hit the ground.
They struck their necks with their hands and cried.
They sought counsel with each other, they searched for clarification:
“Alas, what can we say about it? What more can we add to it?
How long until we are finished off by this catastrophe?
Inside Urim there is death, outside it there is death.
Inside it we are to be finished off by famine.
Outside it we are to be finished off by Elamite weapons.



In Urim the enemy oppresses us, oh, we are finished.”
403-410 The people took refuge (?) behind the city walls.
They were united in fear.
The palace that was destroyed by onrushing water was defiled, its doorbolts
were torn out.
Elam, like a swelling flood wave, left (?) only the ghosts.
In Urim people were smashed as if they were clay pots.
Its refugees were unable to flee, they were trapped inside the walls.

cut off.
Its unblemished oxen and grass-fed sheep were slaughtered.
(1 ms. adds the line: They were cut down as date palms and were tied
together.)
The palm-trees, strong as mighty copper, the heroic strength,
were torn out like rushes, were plucked like rushes, their trunks were
turned sideways.



Their tops lay in the dust, there was no one to raise them.
The midriffs of their palm fronds were cut off and their tops were burnt off.
Their date spadices that used to fall (?) on the well were torn out.
The fertile reeds, which grew in the sacred ......, were defiled.
The great tribute that they had collected was hauled off to the mountains.

destroyed.

The sacred box that no one had set eyes upon was seen by the enemy.
The divine bed was not set up, it was not spread with clean hay.
The statues that were in the treasury were cut down.
The cook, the dream interpreter, and the seal keeper did not perform the cere
monies properly.
They stood by submissively and were carried off by the foreigners.
The holy usga priests of the sacred lustrations, the linen-clad priests,
forsook the divine plans and sacred divine powers, they went off to a foreign
city.



(top: Inanna in her sky-disc above mountains, bottom: Utu, Nannar, & Ningal)
449-459 In his grief Suen approached his father.
He went down on his knee in front of Enlil, the father who begot him:
“O father who begot me, how long will the enemy eye be cast upon my ac
count, how long ......?
The lordship and the kingship that you bestowed ......, father Enlil, the one
who advises with just words,



the wise words of the Land ......, your inimical judgment ......,

Grain, spouse Ninlil, also Grain Goddess, & unidentified with dinner, when gods did the

460-474 Enlil then provided a favorable response to his son Suen:
“My son, the city built for you in joy and prosperity was given to you as your
reign.
The destroyed city, the great wall, the walls with broken battlements: all this
too is part of that reign.



...... the black, black days of the reign that has been your lot.
As for dwelling in your home, the E-temen-ni-guru (ziggurat), that was
properly built
indeed Urim shall be rebuilt in splendor, the people shall bow down to you.
There is to be bounty at its base, there is to be grain.
There is to be splendor at its top, the sun shall rejoice there.
Let an abundance of grain embrace its table.
May Urim, the city whose fate was pronounced by An, be restored for you.”
Having pronounced his blessing, Enlil raised his head toward the heavens:
“May the land, south and highland, be organized for Nanna.
May the roads of the mountains be set in order for Suen.
Like a cloud hugging the earth, they shall submit to him.
By order of An and Enlil it shall be conferred.”
475-477 A Father Nanna stood in his city of Urim with head raised high
again.
The youth Suen could enter again into the E-kic-nu-jal.

Lamentation for the Destruction of Ur (Short Version)
Source: Thorkild Jacobsen, The Treasures of Darkness: A History of Mesopotamian Religion



The Sumerian civilization dwindled approximately 3500 years ago, replaced by
peoples from the North and East; a replacement that was often the result of
war. There are several lament texts that have been found, each mourning the
destruction of a different Sumerian city.
These texts are all from the same time period, which explains the effect of the
nuclear holocaust, the attack of Nergal and Ninurta against Marduk and his
sons, Nabu and Ashur.
The goddess of Ur, Ningal (Nannar‘s spouse), tells how she suffered
under her sense of coming doom.

(Ningal, Nannar‘s spouse, Goddess of
Ur, earthlings in her image & likeness)



“When I was grieving for that day of storm, that day of storm, des
tined for me,
laid upon me, heavy with tears, that day of storm, destined for me,
laid upon me heavy with tears, on me, the queen.
Though I was trembling for that day of storm, that day of storm
destined for me
I could not flee before that day’s fatality.
And of a sudden I espied no happy days within my reign, no happy
days within my reign.
Though I would tremble for that night, that night of cruel weeping
destined for me,
I could not flee before that night’s fatality.
Dread of the storm’s floodlike destruction weighed on me, and of a
sudden on my couch at night,
upon my couch at night no dreams were granted me.
And of a sudden on my couch oblivion, upon my couch oblivion
was not granted.
Because (this) bitter anguish had been destined for my land



as the cow to the (mired) calf — even had I come to help it on the
ground,
I could not have pulled my people back out of the mire.
Because (this) bitter dolor had been destined for my city,
(winged goddess in her sky-disc hovering
above her semi-divine kings)
even if I, birdlike, had stretched my wings, and, (like a bird),
flown to my city, yet my city would have been destroyed on its
foundation,
yet Ur would have perished where it lay.
Because that day of storm (nuclear war) had raised its hand,



and even had I screamed out loud and cried; “Turn back, O day of
storm, (turn) to (thy) desert,”
the breast of that storm would not have been lifted from me.
Then verily, to the assembly, where the crowd had not yet risen,
while the Anunnaki, binding themselves (to uphold the decision),
were still seated, I dragged my feet and I stretched out my arms,
truly I shed my tears in front of An.
Truly I myself mourned in front of Enlil: “May my city not be de
stroyed!” I said indeed to them.
“May Ur not be destroyed!” I said indeed to them.
“And may its people not be killed!” I said indeed to them.
But An never bent towards those words,
and Enlil never with an, “It is pleasing, so be it!” did soothe my
heart.
(Behold,) they gave instruction that the city be destroyed,
(behold,) they gave instruction that Ur be destroyed,
and as its destiny decreed that its inhabitants be killed.

(Enlil, Earth
Colony Commander, Gibil, God of the Kilns, metals)
Enlil — choosing Gibil (Enki‘s son) as his helper
called the (great) hurricane of heaven. The people mourn.



The (blinding) hurricane howling across the skies — the people
mourn
the tempest unsubduable like breaks through levees, beats down
upon, devours the city’s ships,
(all these) he gathered at the base of heaven. The people mourn.
(Great) fires he lit that heralded the storm. The people mourn.
And lit on either flank of furious winds the searing heat of the
desert.
Like flaming heat of noon this fire scorched.
The storm ordered by Enlil in hate, the storm which wears away the
country,
covered Ur like a cloth, veiled it like a linen sheet.
On that day did the storm leave the city; that city was a ruin.



(Nannar, Enlil‘s son, Moon Crescent patron god of Ur,
the god of Biblical Abraham)
O father Nanna (Nannar), that town was left a ruin. The people
mourn.
On that day did the storm leave the country. The people mourn.
Its people(‘s corpses), not potsherds, littered the approaches.
The walls were gaping; the high gates, the roads, were piled with
dead.
In the wide streets, where feasting crowds (once) gathered, jum
bled they lay.
In all the streets and roadways bodies lay.
In open fields that used to fill with dancers, the people lay in
heaps.
The country’s blood now filled its holes, like metal in a mold;



bodies dissolved — like butter left in the sun.
(Nin
gal, King Ur-Nammu twice, & Nannar)
(Nannar, god of the Moon and spouse of Ningal, appeals to his
father, Enlil)
O my father who engendered me!
What has my city done to you?
Why have you turned away from it?
(Enlil, King Anu‘s son & heir to planet Nibiru‘s throne,
& their Earth Colony)



O Enlil! What has my city done to you?
Why have you turned away from it?
The ship of first fruits no longer brings first fruits to the engender
ing father,
no longer goes in to Enlil in Nippur with your bread and food
portions!
O my father who engendered me!
Fold again into your arms my city from its loneliness!
O Enlil! Fold again my Ur into your arms from its loneliness!
Fold again my (temple) Ekishnugal into your arms from its
loneliness!
Let renown emerge for you in Ur!
Let the people expand for you: let the ways of Sumer, which have
been destroyed, be restored for you!



(Enlil & son Nannar, giant
alien Anunnaki gods stationed on Earth)
Enlil answered his son Suen (Nannar) (saying):
“The heart of the wasted city is weeping, reeds (for flutes) of
lament grow therein,
its heart is weeping, reeds (for flutes) of lament grow therein, its
people spend the day in weeping.
O noble Nanna, be thou (concerned) about yourself, what truck
have you with tears?
There is no revoking a verdict, a decree of the assembly,
a command of An and Enlil is not known ever to have been
changed.
Ur was verily granted a kingship — a lasting term it was not
granted.



From days of yore when the country was first settled, to where it
has now proceeded,
Who ever saw a term of office completed?
Its kingship, its term of office, has been uprooted.
It must worry.
(top: semi-divine king & mother goddess Ninsun, bottom:
high-priestess decorates Nannar‘s ziggurat)
(You) my Nanna, do you not worry!
Leave your city!”

his Land,
approached him for the sake of his city — bitterly she weeps.
She approached the lord for the sake of his house — bitterly she weeps.
She approached him for the sake of his devastated city — bitterly she weeps.
She approached him for the sake of his devastated house — before him she makes its bitter
lament.
The woman, after she had composed her song (?) for the tearful balaj instrument,
herself utters softly a lamentation for the smitten (?) house: (Speaking in the 1st Person)
“The storm that came to be — its lamentation hangs heavy on me.
Raging about because of the storm, I am the woman for whom the storm came to be.
85-94



The storm that came to be — its lamentation hangs heavy on me.

Because of this wretched storm I could not see a good day for my rule, not one good day
for my rule.
“The bitter lament having come to be for me during the night,
I trembled on account of that night but I did not flee before the night’s violence.
The awesomeness of this storm, destructive of cities, truly hangs heavy on me (catching radia
tion poisoning by delaying).
Because of its existence, in my nightly sleeping place, even in my nightly sleeping place truly
there was no peace for me.
Nor, because of this wretched storm, was the quiet of my sleeping place,
not even the quiet of my sleeping place, allowed to me. (2 mss. add 1 line: Truly I did not for
sake my Land.)

(giant alien
goddess in flight, sky-disc over mountains)
Because there was bitter distress in my city, I beat my wings like a bird of heaven and flew
to my city;
and my city was destroyed in its foundations; and Urim perished where it lay (nuclear
devastation).
Because the hand of the storm appeared above (missiles), I screamed and cried to it “Return,
O storm, to the plain”.
The storm’s breast did not rise.
“To me, the woman, in the Agrun-kug, my house of queenship, they did not grant a
reign of distant days.
Indeed they established weeping and lamentation for me.
As for the house which used to be where the spirit of the black-headed people (earthlings)
was soothed,
instead of its festivals wrath and terror indeed multiply.
Because of this wretched storm, heavy spirit, and lament and bitterness,
lament and bitterness have been brought into my house, the favorable place,
112-122



my devastated righteous house upon which no eye had been cast.
My house founded by the righteous was pushed over on its side like a garden fence.
“For E-kic-nu-jal, my house of royalty, the good house, my house which has been given
over to tears,
they granted to me as its lot and share: its building, falsely, and its perishing, truly.
Wind and rain have been made to fall on it, as onto a tent,
a shelter on the denuded harvest ground, as onto a shelter on the denuded harvest ground.
Urim, my all-surpassing chamber, the house and the smitten city, all have been uprooted.
Like a shepherd’s sheepfold it has been uprooted.
The swamp has swallowed my possessions accumulated in the city.”

In return for the speech (?) which I had given them, they both bound me together with my
city
and also bound my Urim together with me.

My queen, you have indeed left the house, you have left the city.
How long will you stand aside from your city like an enemy?
Mother Ningal, you confronted your city like an enemy.
Although you are a queen who loves her city, you abandoned your sheepfold.
Although you are one who cares for her Land, you set it on fire.

TABLET I
Narrator invokes Marduk, chief deity of Babylon, and Ishum (Ninurta),
vanguard and companion of Erra (Nergal). Erra is restless and breaks
into a soliloquy. He is anxious to fight and campaign, but hesitates
through natural inertia.
Speaking of himself in the third person, Erra says that what he needs to
stir him to action is Ishum ́s encouragement (Ninurta & Nergal Battle
Marduk)
438



O king of all inhabited lands, creator of the world,
O Hendursagga (Utu‘s son), first born (grandson) of Enlil [ ]
Holder of the sublime scepter, herdsman of the black-headed folk, shepherd
of mankind,
(Ninurta, zealous
slaughterer, Enlil‘s warrior son & heir)
O Ishum (Ninurta), zealous slaughterer, whose hands are suited to bran
dish fierce weapons,
And to make his sharp spear flash, Erra (Nergal), warrior of the gods, was
restless in his dwelling,



(Nergal, god of the Under World, sometimes in texts Enlil‘s son,
sometimes in texts Enki‘s son)
His heart urged him to do battle!
Says he to his weapons.
“Smear yourselves with deadly venom!”
To the Seven, warriors (nuclear missiles, alien technologies) unrivaled,
“Let your weapons be girded!”
He even says to you:
“You are the torch, they will see your light
“You are the vanguard, the gods will [ ]
“You are the stanchion, [zealous] slaughterer!



(Nergal, spouse to Ereshkigal, the powerful Queen of
the Under World)
“(So) up, Erra, from laying waste the land
“How cheerful your mood will be and joyful your heart!
“Erra ́s limbs are sluggish, like those of a mortal lacking sleep,
“He says to himself, ‘Shall I get up or go to sleep?’



(Inanna‘s shem parked at her temple; alien Anunnaki gods missiles on launch pad & in
flight, god in landed command module / shem)
“He says to his weapons, ‘Stay in the corners!’
“To the Seven, warriors unrivaled,
‘Go back to your dwellings!’
“Until you rouse him, he will sleep in his bedrooms,
“He will dally with Mami (unidentified), his mate”.
(With a second invocation, now of Ishum, the narrator introduces the terrible
Seven (nuclear weapons), who stand ready to massacre the “black-headed folk”
or Mesopotamians) (plus Marduk and Nabu)
O Engidudu, (unidentified?) who patrols at night, ever guiding the noble,
Who ever guides young men and women in safety, making light as day,



The Seven, warriors (the 7 nuclear missiles) unrivaled, their divine (alien)
nature is different,
(Egyptian 3-stage rocket; ancient Nubian missile with 2 alien pilots, technologies used
on Earth in our long forgotten ancient past)
Their origins are strange, (alien technologies from planet Nibiru) they are



terrifying,
Whoever sees them is numbed with fear.
Their breath of life is death,
People are too frightened to approach it!
Yet Ishum is the door, bolted before them.
(Anu, King of entire planet Nibiru, father to royal ruling princes &
princesses on Earth Colony)
When Anu, the king of the gods, sowed his seed in the earth,
She bore him seven gods (nuclear missiles), he called them the Seven.
They stood before him, that he ordain their destinies,
He summoned the first to give his instructions,



“Wherever you go and spread terror, have no equal.”
He said to the second,
“Burn like fire, scorch like flame”.
He commanded the third,
“Look like a lion, let him who sees you be paralyzed with fear”.
He said to the fourth,
“Let a mountain collapse when you present your fierce arms”.
He said to the fifth,
“Blast like the wind, scan the circumference of the earth”.
He said to the sixth.
“Go out everywhere (like the deluge) and spare no one”.
The seventh he charged with viperous venom,



” Slay whatever lives”. (nuclear missile #7, brought to Earth by fleeing
Alalu many years prior)
After Anu had ordained destinies for all of the Seven (nuclear missiles),
(Nergal, powerful warrior god of the
Netherworld / Under World / Hades / Hell)
He gave those very ones to Erra, warrior of the gods, saying:
“Let them go beside you, when the clamor of human habitations becomes
noisome to you,
“And you resolve to wreak destruction,
“To massacre the black-headed folk and fell the livestock,



“Let these be your fierce weaponry, let them go beside you”.
The Seven offer the encouragement that Erra needs. . In a rousing call to arms,
they extol the heroic excitement of the campaign, the honor, prestige and grati
fication it brings. The Seven claim vaguely that they are not respected enough,
that others are growing more important than they. They bring up the old
charge that men (earthlings) make too much noise for the gods to sleep, al
though this was not the cause Erra had given for his own lack of sleep. The
Seven claim further that there are too many wild animals on the loose. Their
final claim no doubt the most important one, is that they are bored and out of
training. (for war against Marduk & Nabu!)
These are the ones who are in a fury, holding their weapons aloft,
They are saying to Erra, “Up, do your duty!
“Why have you been sitting in the city like a feeble old man,
“Why sitting at home like a helpless child?
“Shall we eat woman food, like non-combatants?
Have we turned timorous and trembling, as if we can’t fight?
“Going to the field for the young and vigorous is like to a very feast,
“But the noble who stays in the city can never eat enough.
“His people will hold him in low esteem, he will command no respect,



“How could he threaten a campaigner?
“However well developed is the strength of the city dweller,
“How could he possibly best a campaigner?
“However toothsome city bread, it holds nothing to the campfire loaf,
“However sweet fine beer, it holds nothing to water from a skin,
“The terraced palace holds nothing to the wayside sleeping spot!
“Be off to the field, warrior Erra, make your weapons clatter,
“Make loud your battle cry that all around they quake,
“Let the Igigi–gods (those who transport to & from Nibiru & Earth) hear
and extol your name,
(giant aliens
standing upon their zodiac signs & symbols)



(Anu‘s royal alien
giants, those controlling things on Earth Colony)
“Let the Anunna-gods hear and flinch at the mention of your,
“Let all the gods hear and bend for your yoke,
“Let sovereigns hear and fall prostrate before you,
“Let countries hear and bring you their tribute,
“Let the lowly hear and perish of their own accord,
“Let the mighty hear and his strength diminish,
“Let lofty mountains hear and their peaks crumble,
“Let the surging sea hear and convulse, wiping out her increase!
“Let the stalk be yanked from the tough thicket,
“Let reeds of the impenetrable morass be shorn off,
“Let men turn cowards and their clamor subside,
“Let beasts tremble and return to clay,



“Let the gods your ancestors see and praise your valor!
“Warrior Erra (Nergal), why do you neglect the field for the city?
“The very beats and creatures hold us in contempt!
“O warrior Erra, we will tell you, thought that we say be offensive to you!
“Erra the whole land outgrows us,
“You must surely hear our words!
“Do a kindly deed for the gods of hell, who delight in deadly stillness,
“The Anunna–gods (those colonizing on the Earth) cannot fall asleep for
the clamor of humankind,
Beasts are overrunning the meadows, life of the land,
“The farmer sobs bitterly for his field,
“Lion and wolf are felling the livestock,
“The shepherd, who cannot sleep day and night for the sake of his flocks, is
calling upon you,
“We too, who know the mountain passes, have forgotten how to go,
“Cobwebs are spun over our field gear,
“Our fine bow resists and is too strong for us,



“The tip of our sharp arrow is bent out of true,
“Our blade is corroded for want of a slaughter!”
The warrior Erra heard them,
What the Seven said pleased him like finest oil.
He made ready to speak and said to Ishum (Ninurta):
“Why, having heard, did you sit by silent?
“Lead the way, let me begin my campaign!
“[ ] the Seven, warriors without rival,
Make my fierce weapons (the Seven) march by my side,
But you be the vanguard and rear guard”.



(Ninurta, Enlil‘s son & heir, born of the “double seed”, by
father Enlil & mother Ninhursag)
When Ishum heard what he said, he felt pity and said to the warrior Erra:
“O Lord Erra, why have you plotted evil against the gods?
“To lay waste the lands and decimate the people”.
(Nergal attacks Marduk as either his brother or his cousin)



Erra made ready to speak and said to Ishum (Ninurta), his vanguard:
“Keep quiet,Ishum, listen to what I say, as concerns the people of the inhabit
ed world, whom you would spare.
“O vanguard of the gods, wise Ishum, whose counsel is always for the best,
“I am the wild bull in heaven, I am the lion on earth, “I am king in the land, I
am the fiercest among the gods,
“I am warrior among the Igigi–gods, mighty one among the Anunna–gods!
“I am the smiter of wild beasts, battering ram against the mountain,
“I am the blaze in the reed thicket, the broad blade against the rushes,
“I am banner for the march, I blast like the wind, I thunder like the storm,



(Nergal‘s sky-chariot / sky-disc, earthling misunderstood tech
nologies of the alien gods, 1,600 B.C.)
“Like the sun, I scan the circumference of the world, “I am the wild ram
striding forth in the steppe,
“I invade the range and take up my dwelling in the fold,
“All the gods are afraid of a fight, so the black-headed folk (the earthlings)
are contemptuous!
“As for me, since they did not fear my name, and I have disregarded
Marduk ́s command,



(Enlil‘s descendant-son Ninurta & Nergal vrs. Enki‘s descendants Mar
duk & son Nabu, Inanna on Ninurta‘s side)
so he may act according to his wishes “I will make Marduk angry,
stir him from his dwelling, and lay waste the people!” (earthlings die by
tens of thousands)
The warrior Erra (Nergal) set out for Babylon, city of the (Marduk) king
of the gods.



He entered Esagila (Marduk‘s residence), palace of heaven and earth and
stood before him.
(king high-priest atop ziggurat / temple / Marduk‘s
residence, & Marduk prepare for war)
He made ready to speak, saying to the king of the gods:
“Why has your precious image, symbol of your lordship, lost its brilliance?
(Marduk‘s Tower of Babel attempt to possess his own launch & landing central station,
Enlil had them destroy it)
“Your lordly diadem, which made the inner sanctum shine like the outside



tower, why is it dimmed?”
(Marduk, Enki‘s eldest son
& heir, builder of the Tower of Babel, god of Babylon & Egypt)
The king of the gods (Marduk claimed to his supremacy from Babylon)
made ready to speak,
saying to Erra, these words, “O warrior Erra, concerning that deed you said
you would do,
“Once, long ago indeed I grew angry, indeed I left my dwelling and caused
the deluge!
“When I left my dwelling, the regulation of heaven and earth disintegrated:
“The shaking of heaven meant: the positions of the heavenly bodies changed,
nor did I restore them,
“The quaking of netherworld meant: the yield of the furrow diminished, be
ing thereafter difficult to exploit.



“The regulations of heaven and earth disintegrating meant: underground wa
ter diminished, high water receded.
When I looked again, it was struggle to get enough.
“Productivity of living offspring declined, nor did I renew it,
“Such that were I a plowman, I could hold all seed in my hand.
“I built another house and settled therein
(Marduk towers the ziggu
rats / pyramids, founder-god of Babylon & Egypt)
“As to my precious image, which had been struck by the deluge that its ap
pearance was sullied,
“I commanded fire to make my features shine and cleanse my apparel.
“When it had shined my precious image and completed the task, “I donned
my lordly diadem and returned.
“Haughty were my features, terrifying my glare!
“The survivors of the deluge saw what was done,



“Shall I raise my weapon and destroy the rest?
“I sent those craftsmen down to the depths, I ordered them not to come up,
“I removed the wood and gemstone and showed no one where,
“Now then, warrior Erra, as concerns that deed you said you would do,
“Where is the wood, flesh of the gods, suitable for the lord of the universe,
“The sacred tree, splendid stripling, perfect for lordship,
“Whose roots thrust down an hundred leagues through the waters of the vast
ocean to the depths of hell,
(Anu, king of planet Nibiru, father to Enlil &
Enki, the Biblical “sons of God“)
“Whose crown brushed Anu ́s heaven on high?
“Where is the clear gemstone that I reserved for [ ]?
“Where is Ninildum, (unidentified?) great carpenter of my supreme



divinity,
“Wielder of the glittering hatchet, who knows that tool,
“Who makes it shine like the day and puts it in subjection at my feet?
“Where is Kunig-banda, (unidentified?) fashioner of god and man, whose
hands are sacred?
“Where is Ninagal (Enki‘s son), wielder of the upper and lower millstone
“Who grinds up hard copper like hide and who forges tools?
“Where are the choice stones, created by the vast sea, to ornament my
diadem?
“Where are the seven sages of the depths, those sacred fish,

50)

ones who cleansed my person?
The warrior Erra heard him..... [ ]
He made ready to speak, saying to noble Marduk,
“[ craftsmen ],

“Clear gemstone [from] its place will I bring up.”
When Marduk heard this, he made ready to speak, saying to the warrior Erra:
“(When) I rise from my dwelling, the regulation of heaven and earth will
disintegrate,



“The waters will rise and sweep over the land,
“Bright day will turn to darkness, whirlwind will rise and the stars of heaven
will be...
“Ill winds will blow and the eyesight of living creatures will be darkened,
“Demons will raise up and seize [ ],
“They will .... the unarmed one who confronts them!
“The gods of hell will rise up and smite down living creatures,
“Who will keep them at bay till I gird on my weaponry once more?
When Erra heard this, he made himself ready to speak, saying to noble Mar
duk:
“O noble Marduk, while you enter the house, fire cleanses your apparel and
you return to your palace,
“For that time I will govern and keep strong the regulation of heaven and
earth,
“I will go up to heaven and issue instructions to the Igigi gods, (gods in orbit
transporting goods between planets)
“I will go down to the depths and keep the Anunna (Anunnaki) gods in
order.
“I will dispatch the wild demons to the netherworld,



(Nergal with his double-lion-headed alien high-tech
weaponry, used against gods & earthlings)
“I will brandish my fierce weaponry against them,
“I will truss the wings of the ill wind like a bird’s.
“At that house you shall enter, O noble Marduk,
“I will station Anu and Enlil to the right and left, like bulls.”
Noble Marduk heard him, the words which Erra spoke pleased him.
TABLET II
He arose from his dwelling, an inaccessible place,
He set out for the dwelling of the Anunna–gods.
He entered that house and stood before them.



(Utu, Nannar‘s powerful son, Enlil‘s grand
son, symbolized as the Sun god, & damaged king)
Shamash (Utu) looked upon him and let his protective radiance fall...
(Ninsun & uncle Nannar / Sin, the
moon crescent god & patron god of Ur)
Sin (Sin / Nannar) looked everywhere, and did not leave the
Netherworld,

(Gap)
The gods convene to discuss the situation. Ea (Enki), intent upon restoring
Marduk to his place, reasons that, even though the original sublime craftsmen
cannot return, Marduk authorized reproduction of them to be made that are
endowed with wondrous powers by Ea at Marduk ́s command. The repairs are
proceeding well. Erra, while standing guard at the hour where the work is be
ing done lest harm approach, is taking the opportunity to usurp Marduk ́s
power by keeping everyone away from him. So vainglorious is Erra ́s shouting
that Ea resolves to see him humbled.

THE EXPLOITS OF NINURTA OR NINURTA LUGAL-E
“Ninurta, Enlil’s son, was handing down decisions.
At that moment the Lord’s battle-mace looked towards the Mountains,
the Car-ur (Ninurta’s weapon? /general?) cried out aloud to its master:
‘Lord of lofty station, foremost one,
who presides over all lords from the throne dais,
Ninurta, whose orders are unalterable,



whose decisions are faithfully executed; my master!
Heaven copulated with the verdant Earth,
Ninurta: she has born him a warrior who knows no fear
the Asag (Marduk), a child who sucked the power of milk
without ever staying with a wet-nurse, a foster-child,
O my master — knowing no father, a murderer from the Mountains,
a youth who has come forth from ......,
whose face knows no shame; impudent of eye, an arrogant male,
Ninurta (1 ms. has instead: Ninjirsu), rejoicing in his stature.
My Hero, you who are like a bull, I will take my stand beside you.
My master, who turns sympathetically towards his own city,
who is effective in carrying out his mother’s wishes:
it has sired offspring in the Mountains, and spread its seeds far and wide.
The plants have unanimously named it king over them;
like a great wild bull, it tosses its horns amongst them.
The cu, the sajkal, the esi (diorite), the usium,
the kagina (haematite), and the heroic nu stones,



its warriors, constantly come raiding the cities.
For them a shark’s tooth has grown up in the Mountains; it has stripped the
trees.
Before its might the gods of those cities bow towards it.
My master, this same creature has erected a throne dais: it is not lying idle.
Ninurta, Lord, it actually decides the Land’s lawsuits, just as you do.
Who can compass the Asag’s (Marduk’s) dread glory?
Who can counteract the severity of its frown?
People are terrified, fear makes the flesh creep; their eyes are fixed upon it.
My master, the Mountains have taken their offerings to it.”
“Hero! They have appealed to you, because of your father; son of Enlil,
Lord, because of your superior strength they are looking to you here;
since you are strong, my master,they are calling for your help,
saying, Ninurta, that not a single warrior counts except for you!
They wanted to advise you about .......
Hero, there have been consultations with a view to taking away your
kingship.
Ninurta, it is confident that it can lay hands



on the powers received by you in the abzu (Enki’s domain).
Its face is deformed, its location is continually changing;
day by day, the Asag (Enki’s son Marduk) adds territories to its
domain.”
“But you will force it into the shackles of the gods.
You, Antelope of Heaven, must trample the Mountains beneath your hooves,
Ninurta, Lord, son of Enlil.
Who has so far been able to resist its assault?
The besetting Asag is beyond all control, its weight is too heavy.
Rumors of its armies constantly arrive, before ever its soldiers are seen.
This thing’s strength is massive, no weapon has been able to overturn it.
Ninurta, neither the ax nor the all-powerful spear can penetrate its flesh,
no warrior like it has ever been created against you.
Lord, you who reach out towards the august divine powers (alien technolo
gy),
splendor, jewel of the gods, you bull with the features of a wild bull,
with a prominent backbone, ...... this fellow is clever!
My Ninurta, whose form Enki contemplates with favor,



my Uta-ulu (Ninurta), Lord, son of Enlil, what is to be done?
The Lord cried “Alas!” so that Heaven trembled,
and Earth huddled at his feet and was terrified (?) at his strength.
Enlil became confused and went out of the E-kur.
The Mountains were devastated.
That day the earth became dark, the Anuna trembled.
The Hero beat his thighs with his fists. The gods dispersed;
the Anuna (Anunnaki) disappeared over the horizon like sheep.
The Lord arose, touching the sky;
Ninurta went to battle, with one step (?) he covered a league,
he was an alarming storm, and rode on the eight winds towards the rebel
lands.
His arms grasped the lance.
The mace snarled at the Mountains, the club began to devour all the
enemy.
He fitted the evil wind and the sirocco on a pole (?),
he placed the quiver on its hook (?).
An enormous hurricane, irresistible,



went before the Hero, stirred up the dust,
caused the dust to settle, leveled high and low, filled the holes.
It caused a rain of coals and flaming fires; the fire consumed men.
It overturned tall trees by their trunks, reducing the forests to heaps,
Earth put her hands on her heart and cried harrowingly;
the Tigris was muddied, disturbed, cloudy, stirred up.
He hurried to battle on the boat Ma-kar-nunta-eda;
the people there did not know where to turn, they bumped into (?) the walls.
The birds there tried to lift their heads to fly away,
but their wings trailed on the ground.
The storm flooded out the fish there in the subterranean waters,
their mouths snapped at the air.
It reduced the animals of the open country to firewood,
roasting them like locusts. (alien nuclear technology)
It was a deluge rising and disastrously ruining the Mountains.
The Hero Ninurta led the march through the rebel lands.
He killed their messengers in the Mountains, he crushed (?) their cities,



he smote their cowherds over the head like fluttering butterflies,
he tied together their hands with hirin grass,
so that they dashed their heads against walls.
The lights of the Mountains did not gleam in the distance any longer.
People gasped for breath (?); those people were ill,
they hugged themselves, they cursed the Earth,
they considered the day of the Asag’s birth a day of disaster.
The Lord caused bilious poison to run over the rebel lands.
As he went the gall followed, anger filled his heart,
and he rose like a river in spate and engulfed all the enemies.
In his heart he beamed at his lion-headed weapon,
as it flew up like a bird, trampling the Mountains for him. (skyship)
It raised itself on its wings to take away prisoner the disobedient,
it spun around the horizon of heaven to find out what was happening.
Someone from afar came to meet it,
brought news for the tireless one, the one who never rests,
whose wings bear the deluge, the Car-ur (terrible weapon).



What did it gather there ...... for Lord Ninurta?
It reported the deliberations of the Mountains,
it explained their intentions to Lord Ninurta, it outlined (?)
what people were saying about the Asag.
“Hero, beware!” it said concernedly.
The weapon embraced him whom it loved,
the Car-ur (general / pilot / weapon) addressed Lord Ninurta:
“Hero, pitfall (?), net of battle,
Ninurta, King, celestial mace ...... irresistible against the enemy,
vigorous one, tempest which rages against the rebel lands,
wave which submerges the harvest,
King, you have looked on battles, you have ...... in the thick of them.
Ninurta, after gathering the enemy in a battle-net, after erecting a great reed
altar,
Lord, heavenly serpent, purify your pickaxe and your mace!
Ninurta, I will enumerate the names of the warriors you have already
slain:
the Kuli-ana, the Dragon, Gypsum, the Strong Copper,



the hero Six-headed Wild Ram, the Magilum boat,
Lord Saman-ana, the Bison bull, the Palm-tree King,
the Anzud bird (Anzu), the Seven-headed Snake
Ninurta, you slew them in the Mountains.”
“But Lord, do not venture again to a battle as terrible as that.
Do not lift your arm to the smiting of weapons,
to the festival of the young men, to Inanna’s dance!
Lord, do not go to such a great battle as this!
Do not hurry; fix your feet on the ground.
Ninurta, the Asag is waiting for you in the Mountains.
Hero who is so handsome in his crown, firstborn son (of Ninhursag)
whom Ninlil has decorated with numberless charms,
good Lord, whom a princess bore to an en priest,
Hero who wears horns like the moon, who is long life for the king of the
Land,
who opens the sky by great sublime strength, inundation who engulfs the
banks ......,
Ninurta, Lord, full of fearsomeness, who will hurry towards the Mountains,



proud Hero without fellow, this time you will not equal the Asag!
Ninurta, do not make your young men enter the Mountains.”
The Hero, the son, pride of his father,
the very wise, rising from profound deliberation,
Ninurta, the Lord, the son of Enlil, gifted with broad wisdom, the ......
god,
the Lord stretched his leg to mount the onager, and joined the battalions
.......
He spread over the Mountains his great long ......,
he caused ...... to go out among its people like the .......
He reached .......
He went into the rebel lands in the vanguard of the battle.
He gave orders to his lance, and attached it ...... by its cord;
the Lord commanded his mace, and it went to its belt.
The Hero hastened to the battle, he ...... heaven and earth.
He prepared the throw-stick and the shield,
the Mountains were smitten and cringed beside the battle legions of Ninurta.
When the hero was girding on his mace, the sun did not wait, the moon went



in;
they were forgotten, as he marched towards the Mountains;
the day became like pitch.
The Asag leapt up at the head of the battle.
For a club it uprooted the sky, took it in its hand;
like a snake it slid its head along the ground.
It was a mad dog attacking to kill the helpless, dripping with sweat on its
flanks.
Like a wall collapsing, the Asag fell on Ninurta the son of Enlil.
Like an accursed storm, it howled in a raucous voice;
like a gigantic snake, it roared at the Land.
It dried up the waters of the Mountains, dragged away the tamarisks,
tore the flesh of the Earth and covered her with painful wounds.
It set fire to the reed-beds, bathed the sky in blood, turned it inside out;
it dispersed the people there.
At that moment, on that day, the fields became black potash,
across the whole extent of the horizon, reddish like purple dye



truly it was so! (nuclear war, Ninurta & Nergal vrs. Marduk and Nabu)
An (Anu) was overwhelmed, crouched, wrung his hands against his
stomach;
Enlil groaned and hid himself in a corner,
the Anuna flattened themselves against walls,
the house was full of fearful sighing as of pigeons.
The Great Mountain Enlil cried to Ninlil:
“My wife, my son is no longer here; what is there to support me?
The Lord, the authority of the E-kur,
the King who imposes the strong shackle for his father,
a cedar rooted in the abzu, a crown with broad shade,
my son, my security — he is not here any more: who will take me by the
hand?”
The weapon which loved the Lord, obedient to its master,
the Car-ur ...... for Lord Ninurta to his father in Nibru .......
The awesome splendor enveloped Ninurta like a garment, .......
...... bound him: therefore the Lord .......
The weapon ...... spoke to Enlil.



“...... Ninurta, having confidence in himself; ...... he will be standing;
the waters will be dried up as if by the sun’s heat;
...... he will breathe again, he will be standing full of joy.
I shall cause horrid storms to rise against ...... of the Hero Ninurta .......
...... as for him who resisted (?) the Mountains,
he has been amazed by his strength.
Now I shall give my orders, you are to follow these instructions:
1 line unclear
...... in the fields, let him not diminish the population.
...... let him not cause a lack of posterity.
Let him not cause to perish the name of all the kinds of species (alien
weapons)
whose destinies I, Enlil, have decreed.”
The weapon, its heart ......, was reassured:
it slapped its thighs, the Car-ur began to run,it entered the rebel lands,
joyfully it reported the message to Lord Ninurta:
“My master, ...... for you, Enlil has said:



“As the Deluge i.e. Ninurta, before whom the venom has piled up,
attacks the enemy, let him take the Asag by the shoulder,
let him pierce its liver, let my son enter with it into the E-kur.
Then, Ninurta, to the limits of the earth my people
will deservedly praise your power.”
You, Lord who trusts in the word of his father, do not tarry, great strength of
Enlil.
Storm of the rebel lands, who grinds the Mountains like flour,
Ninurta, Enlil’s seal-bearer, go to it!
Do not tarry. My master:
the Asag has constructed a wall of stakes on an earthen rampart;
the fortress is too high and cannot be reached, ...... its fierceness does not
diminish.
3 lines unclear
My master, .......”
Ninurta opened his mouth to speak to the mace .......
He aimed the lance at the Mountains .......
The Lord stretched out an arm towards the clouds.



Day became a dark night.
He yelled like a storm, .......
2 lines unclear
The Lord ...... clouds of dust.
In his battle he smote the Mountains with a cudgel.
The Car-ur made the storm-wind rise to heaven,
scattering the people; like ...... it tore.
Its venom alone destroyed the townspeople.
The destructive mace set fire to the Mountains,
the murderous weapon smashed skulls with its painful teeth,
the club which tears out entrails gnashed its teeth.
The lance was stuck into the ground and the crevasses filled with blood.
In the rebel lands dogs licked it up like milk.
The enemy rose up, crying to wife and child,
“You did not lift your arms in prayer to Lord Ninurta“.
The weapon (alien technology) covered the Mountains with dust,
but did not shake the heart of the Asag.



The Car-ur threw its arms around the neck of the Lord:
“Hero, ah, what further awaits you?
Do not on any account meddle with the hurricane of the Mountains.
Ninurta, Lord, son of Enlil, I tell you again, it is made like a storm.
It is a blister whose smell is foul,
like mucus which comes from the nose it is unpleasant,
Lord, its words are devious, it will not obey you.
My master, it has been created against you as a god; who can help you?
Hero, it falls on the land as a whirlwind, it scrubs it as if with saltwort,
Ninurta, it chases the onagers before it in the Mountains.
Its terrifying splendor sends the dust into clouds,
it causes a downpour of potsherds (alien nuclear technology).
In the rebel lands it is a lion striking with savage teeth; no man can catch it.
After reducing everything to nothing in the north wind, it .......
The sheepfolds have been closed by ghostly demons.
It has dried up the waters in the ground.
In the whirlwind storm, the people are finished, they have no solution



(?).
From an implacable enemy, great Hero, Lord, turn away,” he said quietly.
But the Lord howled at the Mountains, could not withhold a roar.
The Hero did not address the rebel lands, he .......
He reversed the evil that it had done .......
He smashed the heads of all the enemies, he made the Mountains weep.
The Lord ranged about in all directions,
like a soldier saying “I will go on the rampage”.
Like a bird of prey the Asag looked up angrily from the Mountains.
He commanded the rebel lands to be silent and .......
Ninurta approached the enemy and flattened him like a wave (?).
The Asag’s terrifying splendor was contained, it began to fade, it began to
fade.
It looked wonderingly upwards.
Like water he agitated it, he scattered it into the Mountains,
like weeds he pulled it up, like rushes he ripped it up. ...”
ERRA (Nergal) AND ISHUM (Ninurta)



TABLET I
Narrator invokes Marduk, chief deity of Babylon, and Ishum (Ninurta),
vanguard and companion of Erra (Nergal). Erra is restless and breaks
into a soliloquy. He is anxious to fight and campaign, but hesitates
through natural inertia.
Speaking of himself in the third person, Erra says that what he needs to
stir him to action is Ishum ́s encouragement (Ninurta & Nergal Battle
Marduk)
“O Ishum (Ninurta), zealous slaughterer,
whose hands are suited to brandish fierce weapons,
And to make his sharp spear flash, Erra (Nergal), warrior of the gods,
was restless in his dwelling,
His heart urged him to do battle!
Says he to his weapons.
“Smear yourselves with deadly venom!”
To the Seven, warriors (alien technology-nuclear weapons) unrivaled,
“Let your weapons be girded!”
He even says to you:
“You are the torch, they will see your light



“You are the vanguard, the gods will [ ]
“You are the stanchion, [zealous] slaughterer!
“(So) up, Erra, from laying waste the land
“How cheerful your mood will be and joyful your heart!
“Erra ́s limbs are sluggish, like those of a mortal lacking sleep,
“He says to himself, ‘Shall I get up or go to sleep?’
“He says to his weapons, ‘Stay in the corners!’
“To the Seven, warriors unrivaled,
‘Go back to your dwellings!’
“Until you rouse him, he will sleep in his bedrooms,
“He will dally with Mami, his mate”.
(With a second invocation, now of Ishum, the narrator introduces the terrible
Seven (nuclear weapons), who stand ready to massacre the “black-headed folk”
or Mesopotamians) (plus Marduk and Nabu)
O Engidudu, (?) who patrols at night, ever guiding the noble,
Who ever guides young men and women in safety, making light as day,
The Seven, warriors (the 7 nuclear missiles) unrivaled,
their divine nature is different,



Their origins are strange, (alien technology from Nibiru) they are
terrifying,
Whoever sees them is numbed with fear.
Their breath of life is death,
People are too frightened to approach it!
Yet Ishum is the door, bolted before them.
When Anu, the king of the gods, sowed his seed in the earth,
She bore him seven gods (7 missiles), he called them the Seven.
They stood before him, that he ordain their destinies,
He summoned the first to give his instructions,
“Wherever you go and spread terror, have no equal.”
He said to the second,
“Burn like fire, scorch like flame”.
He commanded the third,
“Look like a lion, let him who sees you be paralyzed with fear”.
He said to the fourth,
“Let a mountain collapse when you present your fierce arms”.



He said to the fifth,
“Blast like the wind, scan the circumference of the earth”.
He said to the sixth.
“Go out everywhere (like the deluge) and spare no one”.
The seventh he charged with viperous venom,
” Slay whatever lives”.
After Anu had ordained destinies for all of the Seven (nuclear missiles),
He gave those very ones to Erra, warrior of the gods, saying:
“Let them go beside you,
when the clamor of human habitations becomes noisome to you,
“And you resolve to wreak destruction,
“To massacre the black-headed folk and fell the livestock,
“Let these be your fierce weaponry, let them go beside you”.
The Seven offer the encouragement that Erra needs. . In a rousing call to arms,
they extol the heroic excitement of the campaign, the honor, prestige and grati
fication it brings. The Seven claim vaguely that they are not respected enough,
that others are growing more important than they. They bring up the old
charge that men make too much noise for the gods to sleep, although this was
not the cause Erra had given for his own lack of sleep. The Seven claim further



that there are too many wild animals on the loose. Their final claim no doubt
the most important one, is that they are bored and out of training. (for war
against Marduk & Nabu!)
These are the ones who are in a fury, holding their weapons aloft,
They are saying to Erra, “Up, do your duty!
“Why have you been sitting in the city like a feeble old man,
“Why sitting at home like a helpless child?
“Shall we eat woman food, like non-combatants?
Have we turned timorous and trembling, as if we can’t fight?
“Going to the field for the young and vigorous is like to a very feast,
“But the noble who stays in the city can never eat enough.
“His people will hold him in low esteem, he will command no respect,
“How could he threaten a campaigner?
“However well developed is the strength of the city dweller,
“How could he possibly best a campaigner?
“However toothsome city bread, it holds nothing to the campfire loaf,
“However sweet fine beer, it holds nothing to water from a skin,
“The terraced palace holds nothing to the wayside sleeping spot!



“Be off to the field, warrior Erra, make your weapons clatter,
“Make loud your battle cry that all around they quake,
“Let the Igigi-gods (those who transport to & from Nibiru & Earth)
hear and extol your name,
“Let the Anunna-gods hear and flinch at the mention of your,
“Let all the gods hear and bend for your yoke,
“Let sovereigns hear and fall prostrate before you,
“Let countries hear and bring you their tribute,
“Let the lowly hear and perish of their own accord,
“Let the mighty hear and his strength diminish,
“Let lofty mountains hear and their peaks crumble,
“Let the surging sea hear and convulse, wiping out her increase!
“Let the stalk be yanked from the tough thicket,
“Let reeds of the impenetrable morass be shorn off,
“Let men turn cowards and their clamor subside,
“Let beasts tremble and return to clay,
“Let the gods your ancestors see and praise your valor!



“Warrior Erra, why do you neglect the field for the city?
“The very beats and creatures hold us in contempt!
“O warrior Erra, we will tell you, thought that we say be offensive to you!
“Erra the whole land outgrows us,
“You must surely hear our words!
“Do a kindly deed for the gods of hell, who delight in deadly stillness,
“The Anunna-gods (those on Earth doing the work)
cannot fall asleep for the clamor of humankind,
Beasts are overrunning the meadows, life of the land,
“The farmer sobs bitterly for his field,
“Lion and wolf are felling the livestock,
“The shepherd, who cannot sleep day and night
for the sake of his flocks, is calling upon you,
“We too, who know the mountain passes, have forgotten how to go,
“Cobwebs are spun over our field gear,
“Our fine bow resists and is too strong for us,
“The tip of our sharp arrow is bent out of true,



“Our blade is corroded for want of a slaughter!”
The warrior Erra heard them,
What the Seven said pleased him like finest oil.
He made ready to speak and said to Ishum:
“Why, having heard, did you sit by silent?
“Lead the way, let me begin my campaign!
“[ ] the Seven, warriors without rival,
Make my fierce weapons (the Seven) march by my side,
But you be the vanguard and rear guard”.
When Ishum heard what he said, he felt pity and said to the warrior Erra:
“O Lord Erra, why have you plotted evil against the gods?
“To lay waste the lands and decimate the people”.
Erra made ready to speak and said to Ishum (Ninurta), his vanguard:
“Keep quiet, Ishum, listen to what I say,
as concerns the people of the inhabited world, whom you would spare.
“O vanguard of the gods, wise Ishum, whose counsel is always for the best,
“I am the wild bull in heaven, I am the lion on earth,



“I am king in the land, I am the fiercest among the gods,
“I am warrior among the Igigi-gods, mighty one among the Anunna-gods!
“I am the smiter of wild beasts, battering ram against the mountain,
“I am the blaze in the reed thicket, the broad blade against the rushes,
“I am banner for the march, I blast like the wind, I thunder like the storm,
“Like the sun, I scan the circumference of the world,
“I am the wild ram striding forth in the steppe,
“I invade the range and take up my dwelling in the fold,
“All the gods are afraid of a fight, so the black-headed folk are
contemptuous!
“As for me, since they did not fear my name,
and I have disregarded Marduk ́s command,
so he may act according to his wishes”I will make Marduk angry,
stir him from his dwelling, and lay waste the people!”
The warrior Erra (Nergal) set out for Babylon, city of the king of the
gods.
He entered Esagila (Marduk’s), palace of heaven and earth
and stood before him. ...



When Marduk heard this, he made ready to speak, saying to the warrior Erra:
“(When) I rise from my dwelling,
the regulation of heaven and earth will disintegrate,
“The waters will rise and sweep over the land,
“Bright day will turn to darkness,
whirlwind will rise and the stars of heaven will be...
“Ill winds will blow and the eyesight of living creatures will be darkened,
“Demons will raise up and seize [ ],
“They will .... the unarmed one who confronts them!
“The gods of hell will rise up and smite down living creatures,
“Who will keep them at bay till I gird on my weaponry once more?
When Erra heard this, he made himself ready to speak, saying to noble Mar
duk:
“O noble Marduk, while you enter the house,
fire cleanses your apparel and you return to your palace,
“For that time I will govern and keep strong the regulation of heaven and
earth,
“I will go up to heaven and issue instructions



to the Igigi (gods in orbit under Marduk, to transport goods) gods,
“I will go down to the depths and keep the Anunna (Anunnaki) gods in
order.
“I will dispatch the wild demons to the netherworld,
“I will brandish my fierce weaponry against them,
“I will truss the wings of the ill wind like a bird’s.
“At that house you shall enter, O noble Marduk,
“I will station Anu and Enlil to the right and left, like bulls.”
Noble Marduk heard him, the words which Erra spoke pleased him.
TABLET II
He arose from his dwelling, an inaccessible place,
He set out for the dwelling of the Anunna-gods.
He entered that house and stood before them.
Shamash (Utu) looked upon him and let his protective radiance fall...
Sin (Sin / Nannar) looked everywhere, and did not leave the
Netherworld,
Ill winds rose and the bright daylight was turned to gloom,
The clamor of the peoples throughout the land was stilled,



The Igigi gods were terrified and went up to heaven,
The Anunna gods were frightened and went down to the pit of hell,

1-11 After the cattle pen had been built for the foremost divine
powers
how did it become a haunted place? When will it be restored?
Where once the brick of fate had been laid — who scattered its di
vine powers?
The lamentation is reprized: how did the storeroom of Nibru (Nip
pur),
the shrine Dur-an-ki, become a haunted place? When will it be
restored?
After Ki-ur, the (inner) sanctuary, had been built,
(E-kur, Enlil‘s zig



gurat residence in Nippur)
after the brickwork of E-kur (Enlil‘s temple residence) had been
built,
after Ubcu-unkena had been built, after the shrine Egal-mah had
been built
how did they become haunted? When will they be restored?
(excavations
of Nippur, Enlil‘s residence way above)
12-21 How did the true city become empty?
Its precious designs have been defiled!
How were the city’s festivals neglected?
Its magnificent rites have been thrown into disorder!



In the heart of Nibru, where the divine powers (alien technolo
gies) were allotted
and the black-headed people (earthlings) prolifically
multiplied,
the city’s heart no longer revealed any sign of intelligence
there where the Anuna (Anunnaki alien gods) used to give advice!
In Ubcu-unkena, the place for making great judgments, they no
longer impart decisions or justice!
22-31 Where its gods had established their dwellings, where
their daily rations were offered,
their daises erected, where the sacred royal offering (?) and the
evening meal in their great banquet hall
(alien drinking



bouts lasting weeks)
were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup
Nibru, the city where the black-headed people used to cool
themselves in its spreading shade
in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals.
It was he who sent them scattering, like a scattered herd of
cattle.
How long until its lady, the goddess Ninlil (Enlil‘s spouse),
would ask after the inner city, whose bitter tears were
overwhelming?
(Enlil‘s equal
spouse Ninlil)
32-41 As though it were empty wasteland,



no one enters that great temple whose bustle of activity was
famous.
As for all the great rulers who increased the wealth of the city of
Nibru — why did they disappear?
For how long would Enlil neglect the Land, where the black-head
ed people ate rich grass like sheep?
Tears, lamentation, depression and despair!
How long would his spirit burn and his heart not be placated?
Why were those who once played the cem and ala drums spend
ing their time in bitter lamenting?
Why were the lamenters sitting in its brick buildings?
They were bewailing the hardship which beset them.
42-52 The men whose wives had fallen, whose children had fallen,
were singing “Oh! Our destroyed city!”.
Their city gone, their homes abandoned
as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city,
as the lamenters of wailing,
like the foster-children of an ecstatic no longer knowing their own
intelligence,



the people were smitten, their minds thrown into disorder.
The true temple wails bitterly.
(mud-brick
built Nippur ruins)
1st kirugu
...... built the temple, Ninlil .......
Its jicgijal
The true temple gave you only tears and lamentation
it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansing-rites that are
forgotten!
53-61



(E-kur, Enlil‘s temple
residence ruins in Nippur)
The brickwork of E-kur gave you only tears and lamentation
it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansing-rites that are
forgotten!
It weeps bitter tears over the splendid rites and most precious
plans which are desecrated
its most sacred food rations neglected and ...... into funeral offer
ings, it cries “Alas!”.
The temple despairs of its divine powers (alien technologies),
utterly cleansed, pure, hallowed, which are now defiled!
The true temple, which it is bitter to enter on one’s own, passes
the time ...... tears.
62-67



Because the sealings of the abundant materials stored in the
temple have been broken open,
they have placed the loads on the ground.
Because the property in its well-tended storehouses has been sent
back,
it says “What will they weigh out for me now?”;
because the enemies who do not know good from evil have cut off
all good things,
it sings a bitter dirge;
because they have finished off its populace there like animals, it
cries “Oh! my Land!”.
Because they have piled up the young women,
young men and their little children like heaps of grain, it cries
“Woe!” for them.
Because they have splashed their blood on the ground like a rain
storm,
there is no restraint to its crying.
The temple, like a cow whose calf is cut off, groans bitterly to
itself;
62-67
68-78



it is grief-stricken, and the sweet-voiced lamenters,
like nursemaids singing a lullaby, respond tearfully with its name.
In anguish they bewail the fact that the city’s lord has smashed
heads there,
that he has looked away from it and toward a foreign land instead.
The true temple of all the countries, which had come before
him
what have the black-headed people, who had taken a true path,
done,
what have they forsaken, that their lord has become enraged with
them and walks in anger?
2nd kirugu
It voices bitter cries because he has removed the great divine
powers (alien technologies) from within it.
Its jicgijal
How long will the city’s lord who became angry with it not
turn to it, not say “Alas!” for it?
Why did he cut off the road to its brickwork?
He made the noisy pigeons fly away from their windows.
79-85



Why did he transform the appearance of the temple which knew
voices,
where they used to while away the days in sweet playing of tigi
drums in the brick buildings?
The temple, once a place to offer salutations in humility,
is now as deathly silent as a temple which no one reveres!
As though its purification priest’s equipment were not utterly
sacred,
as though its cleansing-rites did not bring calm in all countries, he
has abandoned it,
turned his breast away from it, among dejection and lamentation
he has made it a sacrilege.
After its fate, how long till his face would be streaked with
teardrops?
He rejected it thus as though it were a blasphemy!
Why has joy left its brickwork?
Night and day he has filled its heart with tears!
Even now, he has made it foreign and a sacrilege!
86-94
95-102



Its lord, who has despoiled it like an evil wind, has de
stroyed that city and its temples!
He has ripped out their foundations, struck them with the
adze,
killed wives and their children within it,
(city ruins areal view,
destroyed by gods & time)
he has turned that city into a deserted city — when would he
restore its ancient property?
Its possessions have been carried off by the wind!
Enlil turned the city which used to be there into a city no longer!
95-102
103-116



He made its mind wander!
He threw its intelligence into disorder and made it haunted!
He took away its food and its water!
He brought to an end its days of familiarity with milk and with
beer!
The temple which he has made a sacrilege utters bitter
lamentations;
he has made its eyes blurred with tears.
The lamenters who perform the dirges respond to it sorrowfully.
No one touches the arm of the city’s lord who has removed its di
vine powers!
No one intercedes!
3rd kirugu
103-116



(Enlil in his sky-disc traverses the skies over Earth Colony)
How did Enlil make all his greatest divine powers fly
away!
No one ever touches his arm!
No one ever intercedes!
Its jicgijal
I am going down to my dirge singer of bitter fates and I
shall weep tearfully to him.
Even now the lamenters who are expert in song make ululating
wails over me!
Now my people who are overcome by hardship voice laments for
me one by one!
Even now the places of refuge of my people whose hearts are
114-115
117-126



burning in dark distress
have been made known to me!
My people whose hearts have been broken on the bitter way
perform the lullabies of my young ones for me in tears!
The well-built houses, ladies’ dwellings, were falsely
founded,
and they have been eroded by the winds!
They are making a lament for me of how the foe has finished off
my Land!
They are addressing the cries of my heart, overwhelmed with bit
terness, in order to soothe it!
(Enlil, Earth Colony Commander, King Anu‘s son
& heir, his decision is final)
127-138



They are beginning their laments about my lord Enlil!
He will have mercy and compassion on me
Enlil, father of the black-headed people, he who will give the order
to restore me!
4th kirugu
My heart is dark, I am destroyed, I am in chaos, I have been
devastated!
Its jicgijal
In the foremost brick buildings they sing that your fate is
bitter!
Even now, to Enlil who will accept your tears for you, weeping bit
ter tears of your own accord,
speak supplications to your lord himself concerning what he did to
you, concerning that fate!
Say to him “My lord, how long?
Look upon me with favor, my lord!”.
Say “Why ......?”.
Say “May your heart be soothed for me — overturn this sacrilege
for your own good!
139-149



The day is ......!”.
Say “Re-enter for me your dwelling in my darkened shrines!”.
Say “Like a bright, cleansed, sacred day, give ...... for your own
good!”.
Say “......!”.
Say “Your misfortunes ...... will rebuild it!”.
Perhaps by this means I can make him have compassion
and mercy for you.
Depression has weakened your heart, but I am the one who has
established good cheer for you.
He will fix it forever as your lot that you shall lift your head high,
he will make good again the hostilities he is directing against you.

Even now your lord has smitten the enemy fury for you!
He has had mercy on you and decreed your fate!
He has said “Enough”, so that he has removed lamentation from
your brick buildings!
In good mood and with a joyful heart he has entered in there
again for you!
Ninurta, the mighty commissioner, has looked after things!
He stood there before the hero, his provider Icme-Dagan,
and issued the command to him to completely rebuild the E
kur, the most precious shrine!
157-166



(Enlil‘s
E-kur, & ziggurat residence in Nippur)
He has restored its ancient property!
Enlil has ordered Icme-Dagan to restore its ziggurat temple,
to make it shine like the day, to make fitting the dais upon its
platform!
He has put back in their place the rites which the enemy disor
dered and desecrated,
along with the scattered divine powers!
He has given him his sacred unchangeable decision
that they should sanctify and purify again the cleansing-rites which
the enemy had put a stop to!
He has told Icme-Dagan, his beloved shepherd,
that spirited bulls and spirited bucks should be slaughtered!
167-180



When decrees the fate of the sacred royal offering place (?),
he will offer salutations and stand there daily in supplication and
prayer.

6th kirugu
How long before you will rest at ease?
Its jicgijal
How long will the brickwork strain its eyes upwards in tears
and lamentations?

universe,
has removed lamentation from your brick buildings and made fa
vorable your humor!
Now, city, your lord who has had compassion and mercy for
you,
181-183

(Ninlil on shore,
Enlil, & son Nuska)
Father Enlil, lord of all countries, who has commanded that you

Nibru!”

and said to him “Rebuild my womens quarters for me! Re-estab

he who mulled things over so that he came to a decision about
them,
Enlil, who found agreeable his command of true words,
who beneficently entered the true temple which had suffered de
struction
he himself is removing what he turned upon you in distress.
Just as he silenced you, when he made joy enter again
he decreed as your fate the sound of choice beer and syrup being
poured out to overflowing.
“Enough! It is time to stifle the lament” he said to you himself.
Because you have been living in a state of neglect, Enlil who has
decreed your fate has said
“My city, you have placated my sacred heart towards you!”.
He has returned to you! “Nibru, you have placated my sacred
heart towards you!”.
He has returned to you!
True city, he has decreed your great fate and made your reign
long!
Nibru, he has decreed your great fate and made your reign long!

10th kirugu
284-296 Father Enlil, the lord whose command cannot be altered,
prince of all countries,
has fixed among the black-headed people, and commanded for
their benefit,
a time when no one is to speak hostile words to another, when a
son is to respect his father,
a time to establish humility in the Land, for the inferior to be as
important as the mighty,
a time when the younger brother, fearing his big brother, is to
show humility,
a time when the elder child is to treat the younger child reason
ably and to pay heed to his words,
a time to take neither weak nor strong away into captivity, but to
serve with great acts of good,
a time to travel the disordered roadways, to extirpate evil growths,
a time when anyone is to go where they will, to hurl no insults at
one’s fellow,
(1 ms. has instead the line:a time when anyone is to go where they will,



to carry oneself humbly in the plain, to perform no sacrilege,)
a time no one is to speak hostile words to another, to perform no
sacrilege,
(1 ms. has instead the line:a time to go from one’s own city to a foreign city,
to have no fear on the plain, to perform no sacrilege,)
a time to remove bitterness from the Land, to establish light
therein,
a time when darkness is to be lifted in the Land, so that living
things should rejoice.

desecrated by the enemy!

salutations!
When he had begun the lament and spoken the supplication,
the prince of all countries treated his body with oil of abundance
as if it were the sweetest syrup!
And his prayer was heard
Enlil looked upon him with favor, Icme-Dagan whose words bring
Enlil pleasure!
Enlil’s constant attendant, with whose thoughts he agrees!
Because the humble one prostrated himself in his devotions and
served there,
because he will entreat him in supplication and will do obeisance,
because he will complete and honor the royal offering and will
return,
because he will keep watch over everything and will not be
negligent,
Enlil has promised to Icme-Dagan (his semi-divine descendant)



his dominion of extended years!
315-323 He promised him that he will be a man of pre-eminent
kingship!
He promised him that he will be a king whose reign is good!
He promised him that he shall have the people inhabit safe
dwellings!
Enlil found agreement in what he had said to the numerous
people!
On the day for decreeing fates, every part of Sumer and Akkad,
among the black-headed people flocking like sheep, among
their well-tended people,
will praise forever the majesty of the Great Mountain Nunamnir
(Enlil), enkara weapon of the universe!
It is his awe-inspiring way!
