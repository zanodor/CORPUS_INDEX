“Iranian plateau (as a direct consequence of the 4th millennium Uruk expansion),
around c. 3500-3000 BC (Hamblin 2006: 40-2), sees the “development of trading
towns and trade networks from Mesopotamia to Turkmenia and Baluchistan” along
with a “settlement in Seistan and foundation of Shahr-i Sokhta” (McIntosh 2008: 420).
The existence of this trade link between Elam and Baluchistan is important for the
emergence of the Indus culture and script. This is because Baluchistan settlements are
associated with the very earliest cultural periods in the Greater Indus Region; the
considerable increase in “the number of settlements known in Baluchistan and in the adjacent lowlands had greatly increased” by around 4300 BC, and they included
important settlements such as Periano Ghundai (in the Zhob Valley), Mundigak (in the
Kandahar region), Faiz Mohammad (in the Quetta Valley), Togau (in the Sarawan
region), and Sheri Khan Tarakai (in the Bannu Basin) (McIntosh 2008: 62). “ (opcit.

Linking these two sites (Mehrgahr and Mundigak) with these early lapis
trade routes places proto-Harappan traders in the Elamite world, in there
were “an assortment of administrative artifacts that includes Proto
Elamite tablets, cylinder seals, and clay sealings found in association at
sites within a large geographical territory from Susa in the west [of the
Iranian plateau] to Shahr-i Sokhta in the east [of the Iranian plateau]...
In relation to this convergence of Elamite and Sumerian cultures,
William Sumner (2003) remarks that “[i]n addition to identical ceramics,
the complex tokens from Sumer (Uruk) and Susa were practically
indistinguishable”” (Sumner, William M. Early urban life in the land of
Anshan: excavations at Tal-e Malyan in the highlands of Iran.
Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology, 2003, p.1. ) (opcit. p.105 Le Blanc)
