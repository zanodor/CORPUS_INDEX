kuṭi 'water-carrier'proves Indus Script is logographic, rebus kuṭhii 'smelter'
Indus Scrript pictograph on a Ur seal is a logograph. It reads in Meluhha kuṭi 'water-carrier' rebus: kuṭhii 'smelter'. This is a clear demonstration of the logograhic nature of Indus Script
Cipher. The pictograph becomes a frequently used Sign 12 and also gets ligatured with the most frequent sign Sign 342 to yield composite hypertext Sign 15.
Sign 342 (rim-of-jar).
On the Ur seal, Sign 12 is indicated by the 'water-carrier' pictograph PLUS two 'stars' PLUS split parenthesis. Seal Ur (Upenn; U.16747); dia. 2.6, ht. 0.9 cm.; Gadd, PBA 18 (1932), pp. 11-12, pl. II, no. 12; Porada 1971: pl.9, fig.5; Parpola, 1994, p. 183; water carrier with a skin (or pot?) hung on each end of the yoke across his shoulders and another one below the crook of his left arm; the vessel on the right end of his yoke is over a receptacle for the water; a star on either side of the head (denoting supernatural?). The whole object is enclosed by 'parenthesis' marks. The parenthesis is perhaps a way of splitting of the ellipse (Hunter, G.R., JRAS, 1932, 476). An unmistakable example of an 'hieroglyphic' seal. The parenthesis is split oval or lozenge shape which is an Indus Script hypertext: mũh 'lozenge-shape' rebus: mũh '(copper) ingot' (Santali) mũhã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron smelters' (Santali)
The reading of the Ur seal is: kuṭi ‘water-carrier’ rebus: kuṭhi ‘smelter’ meḍha ‘polar star’ rebus: meḍ ‘iron’ dula ‘pair’ rebus: dul ‘metal casting’ PLUS mũh 'lozenge-shape
(split parentthesis)' rebus: mũh '(copper) ingot' mũhã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron smelters' (Santali) Thus, the Ur seal signifies seafaring cargo of iron metalcasting ingots from smelter.
The reading of the Ur seal is reinforced by the hieroglyph signifiers on the obverse boss of the seal. kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS dotted circle: dhāv, dāya 'one in dice' + vaṭṭa 'circle' rebus धावड dhāvaḍa 'red ferrite ore smelter' PLUS gaṇḍa 'four' rebus: khaṇḍa 'equipment'; thus, equipment from smelter (for) smithy/forge.

Sign 15 which is a hypertext reads: metalcasting ingot (from) smelter (Sign 12) PLUS Sign 342 karṇika 'rim-of-jar' Rebus: karṇika 'scribe; karṇaka 'steersman';karaṇi 'supercargo'; (upa)karaṇa 'equipment'. Thus, Sign 15 signifies metalcasting ingots and equipment (from) smelter.
