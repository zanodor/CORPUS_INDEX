Ahaṃkāra (अहंकार, “ego”) Buddhi generates Ahamkara (the I-doer) or ego, which has the sense of
possessiveness. Ahamkara determines whether an object is his or not. Its dominant quality is Rajas. In
Hindu iconology, Kālī (‘goddess of time’) holds asevered head in one of her hands. The head
represents the ego (the notion of individuality). The severed head reminds all living beings that there
is no escape from time (which is represented as Kālī).” The triple world is pervaded by pride
(ahaṃkāra) and ego (mamakāra). I will give up deceit and especially lust and anger. Tradition and
virtue (vinaya)—this Kaula (teaching) has emerged today. I will observe all that. O Kaulinī, be
gracious!”.-- Yogakhaṇḍa of the Manthānabhairavatantra.” Ahaṃkāra (अहंकार) is a Sanskrit word
referring to the “individuality, ego”. It is one of the fourteen Adhyātma (pertaining to the body)
mentioned in the Subālopaniṣad (fifth section). The corresponding Ādhibhūta (pertaining to the
elements) is called ahaṃkartavya (that which is done by the self) and the corresponding Adhidaivata
(presiding deity) is rudra. Accordingly, “the nādis form their bond (or connect them). He who moves
in the ego (ahaṃkāra), in ahaṃkartavya, in rudra, in the nādis, in prāṇa, in vijñāna, in ānanda, in
the ākāśa of the heart and within all else—That is Ātman. It is that which should be worshipped. It is
without old age, death, fear, sorrow or end.”

“Hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell respectively form the subjects of the five
intellectual (Vuddhi) organs of man, whereas the faculty of speech, handling,
pleasure, ejections or evacutation, locomotion successively belong to the
(remaining) five operative (Karma-Indriya) ones. The original nature (Avyakta),
Mahan[2] (intellection), Egoism (Ahamkara), the five sensibles (Tanmatras), and
the five gross material principles in their nascent stage in evolution form what is
included within the eight categories of Nature (Prakriti), the remaining sixteen
categories being her modifications (Vikara). The objects of intellection (Mahan)
and Egoism (Ahamkara) as well as of the sense organs of knowledge and actions
are the material principles (Adibhautika) though they are spiritual in themselves
and in their nature...”

“The tutelary god of intellection (Buddhi) is Brahma.
The god Ishvara is the presiding deity of the sense of egoism (Ahamkara);
the moon god is that of the mind (Manah);
the quarters of the heaven, of the ears;
the wind god is that of the skin;
the sun is that of the eyes;
the water is that of the taste;
the earth is that of the smell;
the fire is that of the speech;
Indra is that of the hands;
Vishnu is that of the legs;
Mitra is that of the anus
and Prajapati is that of the organs of generations”-

“The twenty-three creative hierarchies are:—The live devas of sensation,
the five devas of action, the five devas presiding over objects of sensation,
the five devas of elements, and the devas of Manas and Ahāmkaṃra
[Ahaṃkāra?] and Buddhi. But are not these 23 tattvas insentient objects?
No. The text of our Upaniṣad shows that they are sentient beings; and
the Bhāgavata Purāṇa also says the same”.
