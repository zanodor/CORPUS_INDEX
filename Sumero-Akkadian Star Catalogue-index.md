# Index for Sumero-Akkadian Star Catalogue.pdf

Star Catalogue
This catalogue is derived from BPO2. The Sumerian transliteration is in all-caps, and then the Akkadian is in italics. The English translation of the name is in quotes, followed by the modern star or constellation to which it refers.
I have not included alternate spellings for any of the constellation names, as this would lead to a maze of circular definitions. Also, this catalogue is alphabetized by the Sumerian. In the event that the Sumerian name is not known, the constellation is still included and alphabetized by its Akkadian name, but only in this event.
For the sake of anyone looking for the Sumerian or Akkadian translation of a particular constellation, I may try to make an English-Sumerian version of this list. However, because many of the ancient constellations defy modern constellation boundaries, I've gone ahead and done the Sumerian-English first. If I do make an English version, it will probably only include the major zodiacal constellations. Until then, just skim the list and you should find what you're after.
For quick reference, here is a diagram:
For more information on the transliteration of the Sumerian and Akkadian, please see the Introduction.
