Dice Game in Old India
from the essay of
Heinrich Lüders
Das Würfelspiel im alten Indien
Berlin, 1906

Introduction
I could finally lay my hand on an essay of Heinrich Lüders, written for the
Scientific Royal Society - Philology and History - at Göttingen in 1905. As it brought
many answers to my questioning about the way dice games were played in old India,
and particularly in the Mahæbhærata, I first translated it into French, and then tried to
give a abstract in English. You see, from the beginning on, I speak of dice games:
actually, a major difficulty in comprehending the dice game is that they are different
sorts of dice and different types of games that are talked of in the same words.
Another difficulty is that the commentators tend to describe the type of game of the
text in terms of the one they know from their own time
Lüders has done a tremendous work tracing through Indian literature, from the
Veda to some texts already written in Pali, the passages where game terms were
mentioned. He quotes in his essay 270 passages coming from 52 different works1.
I will hereunder summarise his essay, giving only the broad outlines, without
entering into the details The main stress will be laid on the dice game in the
Mahæbhærata. The passages directly translated from Lüders are in blue, to distinguish
them from my version.
Dice
Under the generic term akÒa, very different type of dice are to be found. I will
review them:
Vibh∞taka Nuts: the fruits of the Vibh∞taka tree, the size of a hazelnut, were
called “ the browns, babhru ” in the Veda. They were the dice used in the oldest
periods, from the Vedic to the ritual and the epic dice games. We will see later
how they were played.
Cauri Shells, (kaparda, kapardaka) could have played the same role as the vibh∞taka
nuts. They could also have been played by counting those which fall the
rounded side upside or downside. As they play a very secondary role, we will
come no more on them.
Pæ‹aka (or pæ‹a): right prisms, about 7 x 1 x 1 cm for some, sometimes in gold or in
any other matter, sometimes coloured. The four long sides are marked with
dots (eyes, akÒas), generally from 1 to 4. In certain games played with three
1 I give a list of the quoted works at the end of this article.

pæ‹akas, each one is marked with a special sign. pæ‹akas seems not to have been
known in Vedic times
Accessories
dyotama≈∂ala: a circle drawn in the earth around the gamblers. A gambler can’t
go out of it if he has not paid his debt.
phalaka, pa††aka: a tray on which the dice are thrown during the game or a tray
on which the dice are placed before the game.
adhidevana, æstara, iri≈a: an area slightly dug in the ground on which the dice
are thrown in order they can’t roll everywhere.
aÒ†apada: a board on which pawns are moved according to the result given by the
dice. For different types of game, the boards are different and could maybe
have other names..
særa: pawns moved on a board.
Number of dice
With the vibh∞taka nuts a great number of those nuts was used (150, 400, more
than 100 or even more than 1000 ...). With the pæ‹akas, according to the type of
game, three dice or one dice thrown three times, two dice, one dice.
Throws (ayas, æyas)
aya is the generic name given to the result of a throw (we will see later other
throws with the pæ‹akas, named æyas) . There are four ayas: kƒta, tretæ, dvæpara and
kali (in some specific cases also five).. kƒta is the winning throw, kali the losing one.
- Vibh∞taka nuts
With the vibh∞taka nuts, the dice thrown on the adhidevana are divided in 4
equal parts. If there is no remainder (the number divisible by four), we have kƒta; if
the remainder is three, we have tretæ; if it is two, dvæpara; if it is one, kali.
a) In the ritual games, a certain number of dices are divided between the
participants. In the Agnyædheya, the father receives 12 dice from 49 (a kƒta amount),
in the Ræjasoya, 400 dice are thrown in favour of the king (a kƒta amount again), and
5 given to him, but he doesn’t play with them.
b) For the Vedic game, Lüders wrote:

“ How could we imagine the dice game in the most ancient times, that is difficult to say. We could think for example that the gambler who challenges the other throws at first a certain number of dice on the adhidevana and that the second gambler must throw straight away a number of dice such as the total of the two throws be kƒta (divisible by four) ”
c) In the Mahæbhærata: for Lüders, the dice game played in the epic was
always a game played with Vibh∞taka nuts, apart from some passages in Parvan IV.
He wrote;
“ The type of the dice game appears to be not different in the
Mahæbhærata and in the Vedic hymns. In the epic game, dice were obviously
thrown; the sentence akÒæn kÒipati in MBh III, 34, 5 proves it. Moreover, all
the informations we can collect from the epic match perfectly with what we
know about the ritual game. In the epic as we have seen, piling up of dice is
also mentioned. In III, 34, 5, even and odd dice are mentioned:
akÒæ‡‹ ca dƒÒ†væ ›akuner yathævat kæmænukolæn ayujo yuja‹ ca | ‹akya‡ niyantum abhavisyad ætmæ manyus tu hanyæt puruÒasya dhairyam ||
The expressions yuj and ayuj are understandable only if the number of dice plays a role, like in the ritual game.
“ Granted this hypothesis, a point in Nala’s story that I didn’t understand
till now would be explained. We know that Nala, who, possessed by Kali, has
always been an unlucky gambler, becomes again able to win when ·tupar≈a
passes the akÒahƒdaya on him. The exact circumstances are told in MBh III,
72. We are shown how Nala, in the guise of the chariot driver Bahuka, sets off
with ·tupar≈a and VærÒ≈eya. ·tupar≈a looks with envy at Nala’s skill in driving
horses and prides himself on his perfect command of the numbers (7:
sa‡khyæne parama‡ balam); he gives straight away a proof of his talent, by
counting in a flash the leaves and the fruits of a vibh∞taka tree which stood in
the way. Nala is not convinced by the display; he stops the horses and wants to
go down to fell the tree and count the fruits again. Only after a long harangue
of ·tupar≈a urging him to continue the journey, he contents himself with a
partial test on a branch and finds out that ·tupar≈a’s count is right. Nala is
amazed at this skill. ·tupar≈a explains; “ Know that I am acquainted with the
dice’s secret and that I am an expert on numbers ” (26):
viddhy akÒahƒdayajña‡ mæ‡ sa‡khyæne ca vi‹æradam |
“ And now, Nala suggests they exchange their mutual talents. He
promises ·tupar≈a the a‹vahƒdaya, the secret of the horses and receives
immediately from ·tupar≈a the great secret of the dice (29: akÒænæ‡ hƒdaya‡
param). A soon as he possesses it, Kali gets out of him and enters the



-5
vibh∞taka. Nala is now able to win at the dice game. He comes back home,
challenges PuÒkara and wins his kingdom again. “ This story leaves no doubt that the a‹vahƒdaya consists in the ability to count in the wink of an eye a big number of similar objects. It is blindingly obvious that such an ability was of the utmost importance for the game when the number of thrown dice was concerned. When, for example, the point was to bring the number of thrown dice by the adversary to a multiple of four, as I have supposed above, the victory came naturally to the gambler who was able to count in a flash this number2. “ The relation between the counting ability and the dice skill is alluded to in Sabhæparvan (II, 59, 7). ›akuni praises a good gambler:
yo vetti sa‡khyæ‡ nikƒtau vidhijña‹ ceÒ†æsv akhinnaß kitavo ‘kÒajæsu | mahæmatir ya‹ ca janæti dyota‡ sa vai sarva‡ sahate prakr∞yæsu ||
“ According to St Petersbourg Dictionary, sa‡khyæ could be “ an attentive examination of the pros and cons3 ”, as much as “ a calculation ”, But it seems impossible to me in this context that sa‡khyæ is the same that the sa‡khyæna the gambler has to understand, according to MBh III, 72, 26. Therefore, I translate the verse on the following way: “ The gambler who knows the numbers, who knows the rules in case of cheating, is tirelessly in the activity related to the game the one who is able of everything in the (different game’s) types4 ”, “ If I am right, once in the Veda, the matter is also about numbers. In Av. IV, 16, 5, Varu≈a says:
sa‡khyætæ asya nimiÒo janænæm akÒæn iva ‹vaghn∞ ni minoti tæni ||
The meaning of the two last words is uncertain. I believe, in spite of the difficulties due to the gender, that tæni has to be completed by a concept like “ the flutter of eyelashes ”, and I would translate ni minoti, according to St Petersbourg Dictionary, by “ to measure, to calculate ”; “ He has counted men’s
2 Grierson (JRAS (1904, pp. 355 sq) has compared ·tupar≈a’s talent with the talent of modern kæ≈iyæs who value the crops of wheat or fruits. However interesting be this remark, it doesn’t explain the structural relation between the counting ability and the dice skill. Gierson seems not to have recognized such a relation, although it shows up very clearly from the whole story, and particularly from verse 26. On other minor points, I don’t agree either with Gierson’s interpretations. He thinks ·tupar≈a has challenged Nala to play “ even or odd ”, but there is nowhere a question of such a challenge. I believe even less that ·tupar≈a has chosen the vibh∞taka tree to show his counting ability only because he was a good gambler. He could have chosen any tree to show his talent; the vibh∞taka is chosen because Kali enters it afterwards.
3 N∞laka≈†ha’s explanation is similar: sa‡khyæ‡ samyak khyæna‡ jayaparæjayadværa- vivekam.
4 N∞laka≈†ha explains prakriyæsu by dyotakriyæsu; Böhtlingk, in P.W. translates by “ by his energy ”.

flutters of eyelashes5, he counts them like the gambler counts the dice ”, But whatever the meaning of ni minoti tæni, Varu≈a is compared here with a dice gambler, and when it is said “ he counts ”, it is impossible for the numbers he counts to be others than those which play such an important role in the dice game, according to the Mahæbhærata description. “ We have still to tackle another point. The game’s description, as it is given in MBh (II, 60 sq; 76), will seem to every reader, first surprising, then really incomprehensible. ›akuni, who plays for Duryodhana, and YudhiÒ†hira are seated face to face. First YudhiÒ†hira names his stake, then Duryodhana tells his representative what he has to stake as an equivalent. The storyteller goes on (II, 60, 9):
tato jagræha ›akunis tæn akÒæn akÒatattvavit | jitam ity eva ›akunir YudhiÒ†ham abhæÒata ||
“ ›akuni then, who knew the art of dice, took the dice. “ Won ” said ›akuni to YudhiÒ†hira ”. “ YudhiÒ†hira names straight away another stake. Again, immediately after that, it is said (II, 61, 3):
Kauravæ≈æ‡ kulakara‡ jyeÒ†ha‡ Pæ≈∂avam acyutam | ity uktaß ›akuniß præha jitam ity eva ta‡ nƒpam ||
“ The same dialogue is reproduced 17 times. YudhiÒ†hira stakes all his treasures, his brothers and himself; every time, the issue is briefly announced in the same way:
jitam ity eva ›akunir YudhiÒ†hiram abhæÒata ||
“ Only the first sentence differs; in II, 61, 7; 11; 14; 24; 28; 31; 65, 5; 7; 9; 11; 16; 22; 26; 29, it is:
etac chrutvæ6 vyavasito nikƒti‡ samupæ‹ritaß | In II, 61, 18:
iti eva‡ vædina‡ Pærtha‡ prahasann iva Saubalaß | In II, 61, 21;
iti eva‡ ukte vacane kƒtavairo durætmavæn | In II, 65, 14;
evam uktvæ tu tæn akÒæn Chakuniß pratyad∞vyata7 |
Finally ›akuni commits YudhiÒ†hira to stake Draupad∞, and this he agrees to. It is said (II, 65, 45):
Saubalas tu abhidhæyaiva‡ jitakæs∞ madotka†aß |
jitam ity eva tæn akÒæn punar evænvapadyata ||
5 Sæya≈a understands sa‡khyætæ as the Nom. Sing. of sa‡khyætƒ and links it to nimiÒaß as a Gen. going with asya.
6 .In II, 61, 7: eva‡ ‹rutvæ.
7 The words evam uktvæ relate to ›akuni’s short sarcastic remark when YudhiÒ†hira begins to stake his brothers.



-7
The game’s procedure is described in the same way for the second dice game. ›akuni draws up precisely what is at stake: the losing party will have to live twelve years in the forest and one year unrecognised among the men. It is then briefly said (II, 76, 24)
pratijagræha ta‡ Pærtho glana‡ jagræha Saubalaß | jitam ity eva ›akunir YudhiÒ†hiram abhæÒata ||
It could be concluded from the complete silence of the text on YudhiÒ†hira’s throws that he, during all the game, never threw dice, but I believe that this conclusion isn’t right. It isn’t said either, in 17 of the 21 cases, that ›akuni throws the dice, and yet, as far as he is concerned, nobody doubts it. In one case (II, 65, 14), it is said however that “ he plays in answer ”, pratyad∞vyata, and that seems to suggest clearly YudhiÒ†hira has thrown the dice before him. If the previous hypothesis on the game’s procedure were correct, the description of the Mahæbhærata would be perfectly clear: YudhiÒ†hira names his stake and straight afterward throws a certain number of dice; ›akuni throws immediately such a number of dice that the total would be kƒta. “ Concerning the value of the ayas in the epic game, kƒta seems to always occupy the first place, while kali occupies the lowest. This last sentence becomes clear in Nala’s story: Nala always loses because he is possessed by Kali, the personified losing throw. Thus the epic game is the same as the one we have recognized as usual in the Vedic times..
“ Concerning the word akÒa in the Mahæbhærata, it is always explained as
pæ‹a by N∞laka≈†ha. The description of the game between ›akuni and
YudhiÒ†hira in Sabhæparvan, between Nala and PuÒkara in Æra≈yaparvan,
shows clearly that what is played here is the ancient Vedic game with
Vibh∞taka nuts8, that probably N∞laka≈†ha didn’t know. In few other passages,
akÒa seems to designate pæ‹aka.. akÒas are mentioned in MBh, IV, 7, 1, that
are made of cat’s eye gem and gold9, in IV, 1, 25, black and red akÒas made in
cat’s eye gem, in gold, in ivory10, and if it is possible to reproduce Vibh∞taka
8 I hope to prove that later on..
9 vaidoryaropæn pratimucya kæñcanæn akÒæn parigƒhya væsasæ |
N∞laka≈†ha, who had evidently in mind the Caupur or the Chess with dice, tries to complete vaidoryaropæn and kæñcanæn ‹ær∞n interpreting them as akÒæn: vaidoryaropæn kæñcanæ‡‹ ca ‹ær∞n | ida‡ ‹vetarakta‹ær∞≈æ‡ ‹ariphalakasya copalakÒa≈am | akÒæn pæ‹æ‡‹ ca. This construction seems impossible to me if I consider that the matter is about a dice game combined with a board.
10 vaidoryæn kæñcanæn dæntæn phalair jyot∞rasaiß saha | kƒÒ≈ækÒæl lohitækÒæ‡‹ ca nivartsyæmi manoramæn ||
The second pæda isn’t clear for me. N∞laka≈†ha understands here dæntæn as Òær∞n, and relates vaidoryæn, kæñcanæn et jyot∞rasaiß to it, that would mean black and red. He analyses phalaiß as ‹aristhæpanærthæni koÒ†hayuktæni kæÒ†hædimayæni phalakæni taiß., by what he means “ wooden board a.s.o., provided with fields for placing the pawns ”, and not as Hopkins (Position of the Ruling Caste in Ancient India, JAOS,

nuts or cauri shells in gold, their reproduction in gems, or ivory, or in different
colours is very unlikely, and in any case, not confirmed elsewhere. In MBh,
IV, 68, it is told how the king Viræ†a got angry with YudhiÒ†hira during a dice
game and, furious, hit him with a dice on the nose, making it bleed (45-46):
tataß prakupito ræjæ tam akÒe≈æhanad bhƒ‹am |
mukhe YudhiÒ†hira‡ kopæn naivam ity eva bhartsayan ||
“ Here the word akÒa can’t designate a Vibh∞taka nut, the size of a hazelnut, with which one can’t make somebody bleed. The author could only have a pæ‹aka in mind, which is long and heavy enough to wound. “ And it is certainly no accident if all these passages where akÒa can be understood as pæ‹aka, are found in Viræ†aparvan, i. e. the Parvan in which other lifestyles and customs appear, apparently more recent than in the others parts of the epic11. I find no difficulty in admitting that akÒa has another signification in this fourth Parvan , which speaks about another type of game, than in the others12 ”
“ According to all that, it seems evident to me that the Vedic game and the epic game are identical. With one exception only in the Viræ†aparvan whose author, as I have shown before, had in mind a game with pæ‹akas, probably combined with a game board; to which we will come back later on. The word vƒÒa in MBh III, 59, 6; 7 could make us think of a game with pæ‹akas if we understand it really as the name of a dice throw, because, from all we know, such a name could be found only in the game with pa‹akas and not at all in a game with vibh∞taka nuts. But I believe this conclusion isn’t right; I rely for that on the argument I have given above against the interpretation of vƒÒa as the name of a throw. For, if we interpret vƒÒa this way, we would have to admit that the author of Nala’s story III, 59, 6; 7, had in mind a completely different type of game than in the rest of his work, which seems very unlikely ”
8
Vol. XIII, p. 123): “ an hollowed vessel for rattling the dice ”. He has in mind the same game than in IV, 7,1. In the Hariva‡‹a, it is also told about red and black dice..
11 The reason for that is probably that, concerning the Fourth Book’s content, apart for the didactic parts, there is no former source by which the author could feel himself bound, while for the other books, he has to older descriptions at his disposal.
12 I will return on this later on. A picture in the Bombay edition of this Parvan, on which YudhiÒ†hira is depicted holding two pæ‹akas in hand, shows that the modern Indians imagine Viræ†a Parvan’s akÒa as a pæ‹aka. Concerning our problem, that proves nothing, for today as in N∞laka≈†ha’s time, dice game is seen all over the Mahæbhærata as a game played with pæ‹akas.



-9
d) in the Cha≈∂yoga UpaniÒad and the Mƒcchaka†ika, the rule seems to
be more complex: The stake is divided in ten parts, five brought by each player. The
rule is:
ubhayor dhane pratyeka‡ da‹adhæ kƒte | yadi vædi ekæ©ka‡ pætayet tadaikam
a‡‹a‡ dhanæd dharet | dvya©kapæte porve≈a saha tr∞n a‡‹æ‡s | trya©kapæte
porvais tribhiß saha Òa∂ a‡‹æ‡‹ | catura©kapæte porvaiß Òa∂bhiß saha da‹æpy
a‡‹æn hared iti.
If the player makes kali, he takes one part of the stake (dhana), three with
dvæpara, six with tretæ, and all the ten parts with kƒta.
e) In Pali Literature: in some passages, the game is played with vibh∞taka
nuts.
“ While in the Jætaka, the bad loser, every time he loses, hides a dice in
the mouth what leads as a result to the game’s cessation, according to the
Pæyasisuttanta he swallows up all the oncoming kalis (ægatægata‡ kali‡ gilati)
and turns thus the game in his favour, for his adversary reproaches him for
getting only winning throws (tva‡ kho samma ekantikena jinæsi). ... The author
of the Suttanta could only have had in mind the game with (swallowable)
Vibh∞taka nuts, and understood by kali the rest of the division by four; to
swallow them shifted the throw from the losing to the winning one ”
But the games are more often played with pæ‹akas.
- Pæ‹akas
Generally, the upper side of the pæ‹aka gives the result of the throw, from 1 to
4. There are many different ways to play with pæ‹akas.
a) Oracle: with three dice, each one marked with a sign: pot, discus and
elephant, to give an order for reading the figures of the throw or with one dice
thrown three times. Actually, the combinations do not have the same value: 421 is
not equivalent to 124 or 214. There are thus 64 possible different throws, each one
receives a name, called æya. I suppose that each æya has a particular meaning to read
the future, like the 64 figures of the Yi King.
b) With one or more dice: We meet again our ayas, from kƒta to kali (the
winner is the one who makes the winning aya, i.e. kƒta (ka†a in Pali), or our æyas, the
winner being the one who throws the chosen æya. It seems to be a pure question of
luck, but there is also a part of skill in this game. Once the dice thrown, the gambler
can catch them into the air and throw them again. The Vidhurapa≈∂itajætaka tells:
“ After the king has sung the Game’s Song and rolled the dice in the
hand, he threw them in the air. Because of Pu≈≈aka’s magical power, the dice
were falling in the king’s disfavour. But, due to his great skill, the king realised
that the dice were falling wrong. He picked them into the air, and threw them
again. This second time, they were falling again in the king’s disfavour. He
realised that and seized them again the same way ”. ...



- 10
“ The gambler’s skill, as the storyteller highlights it, consists in recognising
in the wink of an eye if the dice will fall in his favour or not (ræjæ jotasippamhi
sukusalatæya pæsake attano paræjayæya bhassante ñatvæ) ”.
If we compare these Gæthæs with the Mahæbhærata we find the same
expressions:
“ Gæthæ 91 says about the two gamblers: te pævisu‡ akkhamadena mattæ.
The epic also knows the expression “ intoxicated by the game”, or “ by the
game’s drunkenness”: It appears even in triÒ†ubh, to the detriment of Òloka..
MBh II, 67, 4 reports the embassy of Draupad∞:
YudhiÒ†hira dyotamadena matto Duryodhano Draupadi tvæm ajaiÒ∞t |
and she answers (5):
mo∂ho ræjæ dyotamadena matto hy abhon nænyat kaitavam asya ki‡cit |
In ‹loka, for reasons of metrics there is a slight modification. In MBh III, 59,
10, Nala says:
tam akÒamadasa‡atta‡ suhƒdæ‡ na tu ka‹cana |
niværa≈e ‘bhavac chakto d∞vyamænam ari‡damam ||
In the same way that Pu≈≈aka had insisted before playing on the fact the
game should take place without cheating (G.89-90): dhammena jiyyæma
asæhasena and passantu no te asa†hena yuddha‡, YudhiÒ†hira insists as well on
the “ fair play ” (MBh II, 59, 10;11:
dharme≈a tu jayo yudhe tatpara‡ na tu devanam | ajihmam a‹a†ham yuddham etat satpuruÒavratam ||
These correspondances show the close link between the epic and the Gæthæ’s poetry ”.
c) With a board. Pawns are moved on a board, according to the result given
by the dice. For different types of game, the boards are different, and it is very
difficult to find which game is played and how. Sometimes, we have a description
quite complete; Lüders gives for example Amaracandra’s Bælabhærata (II, 5, 10 sq)
where the game played between ∑akuni and YudhiÒ†hira is described in the
following way:
“ This text is about a dice game played on a board. In verse 11, there is
talk of two dice (akÒau), like in Bhartƒhari and Mayora, and they are called
aÒ†æpadæÒ†æpadamordhni pætyamænau. So each player uses one dice and one
aÒ†æpada, the latter used as a game board, like the phalaka of the Jætakas ”...
“ The pawns are mentioned many times, and seem to be very important
for the game: verse 10 tells us that Duryodhana was about to play with pawns
against YudhiÒ†hira (særai rantum). The verses 13 and 14 show that they are
one half black and the other red; they correspond thus to the colour of the
dice. The verse 12 speaks of the clatter of the pawns moved from one field to



- 11
the other (gƒhæntaræropa≈a) and in verse 14 they are compared to the kings,
for as the kings, they are put in, elevated, imprisoned and freed again.
utthæpitæropitabaddhamuktaiß ‹yæmai‹ ca raktai‹ ca nƒpair ivaitau |
‹ærair vicikr∞∂atur ekacittau gama‡ care ‘py ædadhatæv alakÒam13 ||
The mention of pawns moving according to the result of dice’s throws
shows clearly that we are dealing with a variant, maybe with the ancestor of
the TricTrac game or of the modern Pac∞s∞ or Caupur14. The mode in which
the pawns were moved was obviously similar to the present one, at least if we
keep to Patañjali’s commentary on Pæ≈ini (V, 2, 9) for the game in question15,
which seems quite obvious. In the rule above, Pæ≈ini teaches us that ayænaya
kha, i. e.. the taddhita suffix ina, has the meaning of “ to move toward ”, and he
adds:
ayænaya‡ neya ity ucyate tatra na jñæyate ko ‘yaß ko ‘naya iti | ayaß
pradakÒi≈am | anayaß prasavyam | pradakÒi≈aprasavyagæminæ‡
‹æræ≈æ‡ yasmin paraiß padænæm asamæve‹aß so ‘yænayaß | ayænaya‡
neyo ‘yænay∞naß ‹æraß
“ That means: to move toward ayænaya. But we don’t know what is aya,
and what is anaya ? aya goes toward right anaya toward left16. When the
fields in which the pawns arrive as they are moved to the right or to the
13 The last Pæda is incomprehensible for me, however I would say that gama et cara, according to Hemacandra, Anekærthasa‡graha (II, 313, 405) are used with the meaning of dyotabheda and dyotaprabheda.
14 Mahe‹vara thinks obviously to these games when, in his commentary on Amara, he explains akÒa, devana and pæ‹aka as three synonyms of dice, “ which allows the pawns’ movement ” (‹æripari≈ayane hetubhotasya pæ‹asya).
15 According to Mac Donell (a. a. O., p. 121), this game would have been exactly the same than the present one. He says: This game is described this way in Patañjali’s MahæbhæÒya: “ Two opposed parties move with their pieces (‹æra) to the right and then, after traversing the fields or squares (pada) on their own side, turn to the left and try to move into the position of the adversary ”. If we compare this description with the above quoted texts, we see that it shares not much with the original, but coincides marvellously with the way Weber (Ind. Stud. XIII, pp. 422 sq) depicts the German TricTrac game: “ BhæÒya’s indications .. and Kaiyya†a’s explanation ... don’t left any doubt that the game in question is our TricTrac, in which the opposite camps move first to the right, then, after having crossed the fields on their side, turn toward the left and try to enter the position of the adversary.”.
16 Weber (Ind. Stud. III, pp. 472 sq), who was the first to show the connexion between these passages of the MahæbhæÒya and Bartƒhari, thinks this explanation of aya and anaya has to be purely rejected and he translates ayænay∞na by “ (piece that) is exposed to luck and unluck, i.e. to chance ”, but we see no reason not to trust Patañjali’s explanation. Macdonell (a. a. O.) goes farther and claims that this game was called ayænaya, luck and unluck), as shown in the above quoted texts. Patañjali doesn’t absolutly speak of the game’s name.

left are unoccupied by the pawns from the opposite camp, it is ayænaya.
The pawn to move toward ayænaya is called ayænay∞na17”.
So we can follow this game until Pæ≈ini’s time. However it seems
impossible to me that this is the game which is thought of in the Mahæbhærata,
except in the quoted passages of Book IV and maybe in V, 69, 29 sq. In
more recent times, it seems that the TricTrac game (if we could call it this
way) has developed itself a lot, making the old dice game decline ”.
There are obviously many games played with dice and a board, but, contrary to
Lüders, I don’t think that the modern games, like Pach∞s∞ and Cauri, could be derived
from the TricTrac-like game described above.
Conclusion
According to this essay, we are quite certain that from the Vedic to the epic
time, dice game was played with vibh∞taka nuts. This kind of dice was used for ritual
purposes with specific modus operandi, and for gambling. The numbers of thrown
dice played a predominant role. Lüders tells us very cautiously (it could be thought
for example ..) how he think the game was played (see pp 3-4, in bold, Vedic game).
Then the vibh∞taka nuts gave way to pæ‹aka dice which could be played alone for
divination or gambling purposes, or with a board, giving way to the modern games.
Lüders is very humble concerning his work. He wrotes:
In conclusion to his article “On Vibh∞taka Tree”, Roth had to recognize:
“ How was this game going on and what was its purpose, nobody could tell ”. If
I dare, in spite of that, deal with this difficult question, it is because a whole
series of texts have appeared reecently that could throw some light on the
obscurity in which the dice game is shrouded. I think I could, thanks to them,
bring some light, on some points at least. But, in spite of that, a lot remains
unexplained and this new material itself brings new difficulties that I am not
able to solve. I can thus consider this article only as a timid essay in a field that
has known until now no satisfactory description.
