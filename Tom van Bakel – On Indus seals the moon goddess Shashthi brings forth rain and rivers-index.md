On Indus seals the moon goddess Shashthi bring forth rain and rivers
It seems that the activities of only four gods are often symbolized on Indus seals, in particular the activities of Kartikeya and Shashthi are shown on almost every seal. They prove to be extremely important: some seals even show that these two gods produce rain and rivers.
First let us look at Shashthi. Her name literally means ‘sixth’:
‘Shashthi (Sanskrit: Ṣaṣṭhī, literally ‘sixth’) is a Hindu folk goddess, venerated as the benefactor and protector of children . She is also the deity of vegetation and reproduction and is believed to bestow children and assist during childbirth.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
Her worship is prescribed to occur on the sixth day of each lunar month of the Hindu calendar:
‘The worship of Shashthi is prescribed to occur on the sixth day of each lunar month of the Hindu calendar as well as on the sixth day after a child's birth. Barren women desiring to conceive and mothers seeking to ensure the protection of their children will worship Shashthi and request her blessings and aid. She is especially venerated in eastern India’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
And thus, she is related to the crescent, which looks like a scale, a vessel or a beaker: she is symbolically represented by an earthenware pitcher:
‘She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants. She is
symbolically represented in a variety of forms, including an earthenware pitcher, a banyan tree or part of it or a red stone beneath such a tree; outdoor spaces termed shashthitala are also consecrated for her worship.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
She may be heaven’s wide vessel:
Rigveda 1-46 called: ‘Asvins’.
7 ‘Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore O Asvins, harness ye the car. 8 The heaven's wide vessel is your own on the flood's shore your chariot waits Drops, with the hymn, have been prepared.’



H-764 B
On Indus seals Shashthi is symbolized by U-signs. On this seal are three of them because the moon goddess is three-fold: she is Tridevi, together with the river goddess Valli and the storm goddess Devasena.
M-1290
To the left the crescent of Shashthi is transformed into a cup. In this cup is a ladle and in the Rigveda they are linked to soma:
Rigveda 10-91 called: ‘Agni’.
15 ‘Into thy mouth is poured the offering, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle’.
In the Rigveda this ritual drink was connected to the moon god Soma, but in the Indus Valley Civilization it was connected to Shashthi.
M-33 a
To show it well again: to the right side of this seal a deity is wearing this cup with a ladle.



H-2091 B
Shashthi is a mother goddess and she is symbolized by this womb. It is divided in six parts as Shashti literally means ‘sixth’.
M-1801 a
To the right side of this seal a jar contains this six-divided womb, which confirms that this jar is equal to the mother goddess.



M-1005 A M-1101 H-413 A
On these broken seals three beakers are turned and now rain is falling down, symbolized by the small lines.
Rigveda 9-96 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
13 ‘Flow onward, Soma, rich in sweets and holy, enrobed in waters on the fleecy summit. Settle in vessels that are full of fatness, as cheering and most gladdening drink for Indra. 14 Pour, hundred-streamed, winner of thousands, mighty at the Gods' banquet, Pour the rain of heaven,
While thou with rivers roarest in the beaker, and blent with milk prolongest our existence’.
Two of these beakers contain a six-divided womb, which symbolize that these beakers and the mother goddess Shashthi are one and the same.
H-254 A
In the Rigveda 9-96 we read that soma roast with the rivers in the beaker:
Rigveda 9-96 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
13 ‘Flow onward, Soma, rich in sweets and holy, enrobed in waters on the fleecy summit. Settle in vessels that are full of fatness, as cheering and most gladdening drink for Indra. 14 Pour, hundred-streamed, winner of thousands, mighty at the Gods' banquet, Pour the rain of heaven, While thou with rivers roarest in the beaker, and blent with milk prolongest our existence’.
On the right side of this seal this beaker is turned and now a river is decending: Shashthi let the rivers flow.



M-1496 A
On the left-hand side there are two small lines on both sides of the U-shape. These lines indicate that the moon goddess is united with the four aspects of Kartikeya, who is identical with four different gods in the Tolkāppiyam:
1. Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), 2. Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) 3. And Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) 4. And Varunan ‘the sea god’.
One of these gods is Varuna, the sea god. In Rigveda 5-85 he lets the big cask, opening downward, therewith the universe's Sovran waters earth, as the shower of rain bedews the barley’.
Rigveda 5-85 called: ‘Varuna’. 3 Varuna lets the big cask, opening downward, flow through the heaven and earth and air's midregion.
Therewith the universe's Sovran waters earth as the shower of rain bedews the barley. loose them’.
This means, that Karikeya is a rain god.
M-1324
On this seal the U-sign with four small lines is placed on a figure that bears water-skins, he will open these water-skins and then it will rain. This figure with his U-sign symbolizes that Kartikeya and Shashthi cause rain to fall.



Proceedings of the British Academy, XVIII, 1932, pp. 11-12, Plate II, No. 12
This is an impression of a seal found at Ur. It is of ancient Indian style and depicts a god who carries a water-skin hung on each end of the yoke across his shoulders.
In Rig Veda 5-83-8 a prayer ask Parjanya to open his water-skin and to draw it downwards and to lift up the mighty vessel to pour down water:
‘Thunder and roar: the germ of life deposit. Fly round us on thy chariot water laden. Thine opened water-skin draw with thee downward, and let the hollows and the heights be level. Lift up the
mighty vessel, pour down water, and let the liberated streams rush forward. Saturate both the earth and Heaven with fatness,’
H-157
On this seal the U-sign with four small lines symbolize that Kartikeya is united with Shashgthi. Placed on a figure carrying water-skins it symbolizes that Kartikeya and Shashthi sends rain like Parjanya:
Rigveda 9-2 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
1. ‘Soma, flow on, inviting Gods, speed to the purifying cloth: Pass into Indra, as a Bull. 2 As mighty food speed hitherward, Indu, as a most splendid Steer: Sit in thy place as one with strength.
9 Indu as, Indra's Friend, on us pour with a stream of sweetness, like Parjanya sender of the rain.
10 Winner of kine, Indu, art thou, winner of heroes, steeds, and strength Primeval Soul of sacrifice’.



M-995 H-516 M-229 M-188
On these four seals Kartikeya/Shashthi carry water-skins: they will open these skins and then it will rain:
Rigveda 9-17 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
1. ‘Like rivers down a steep descent, slaying the Vrtras, full of zeal, The rapid Soma-streams have flowed.
2 The drops of Soma juice effused fall like the rain upon the earth: To Indra flow the Soma-streams.
3 With swelling wave the gladdening drink, the Soma, flows into the sieve, Loving the Gods and slaying fiends’.
In the middle of these seals is a single line symbolizing a soma-stalk: like a pillar it supports the sky:
Rigveda 9-74 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’. 2 ‘A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way. He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move!’
These four seals show that Kartikeya/Shashthi produce rain as well as soma.
H-81 M1885 a M-1880 a M-1888 a
Again, on these four seals Kartikeya/Shashthi carry water-skins and like Parjanya they will send rain:
Rigveda 9-2 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’. 1. ‘Soma, flow on, inviting Gods, speed to the purifying cloth: Pass into Indra, as a Bull.
2 As mighty food speed hitherward, Indu, as a most splendid Steer: Sit in thy place as one with strength. 9 Indu as, Indra's Friend, on us pour with a stream of sweetness, like Parjanya sender of the rain’.
Besides that they give Indra, who has the shape of a bull, his soma drink:
Rigveda 9-8 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’. O Indu, flow into thy Friend.
Send down the rain from heaven, a stream of opulence from earth. Give us, O Soma, victory in war. 9 May we obtain thee, Indra's drink, who viewest men and findest light, Gain thee, and progeny and food’.



H-764 B
Again, on Indus seals, Shashthi is symbolized by three U-signs because she is triple in the first place: she is Tridevi. But these three U-signs also correspond to the signs on the back, which also represent the moon goddess.
H-764 A
To the left there are two small lines on both sides of the U-shape. These lines indicate that the moon goddess is united with the four aspects of Kartikeya, who is identical with four different gods in the Tolkāppiyam:
1. Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), 2. Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) 3. And Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) 4. And Varunan ‘the sea god’.
‘In Tamil literature: The Tolkāppiyam, one of the most ancient texts of the Tamil literature, mentions cēyōṉ ‘the red one’, who is identified with Murugan, whose name is literally Murukaṉ ‘the youth’; the other gods referred to in the Tolkāppiyam are Māyōṉ ‘the dark one’ (identified with Vishnu), Vēntaṉ ‘the sovereign’ (identified with Indra) and Korravai ‘the victorious’ (identified with Kali) and Varunan ‘the sea god’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan
The sign is the middle is the crescent shaped like a sheep-skin filled with soma:
Rigveda 9-69 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
3 ‘He flows about the sheep-skin, longing for a bride: he looses Aditi's Daughters for the worshipper. The sacred drink hath come, gold-tinted, well-restrained: like a strong Bull he shines, whetting his manly might. 4 The Bull is bellowing; the Cows are coming nigh: the Goddesses approach the God's own resting place. Onward hath Soma passed through the sheep's fair bright fleece, and hath, as 'twere, endued a garment newly washed’.
And the third sign is a womb, which symbolizes that after Shashthi is united with Kartikeya, she gives birth to a child.



H-2050 A H-2050 B
Finally, on these seals the Shashthi cups are shown in two ways: first they are turned over and two water-skins hang on them and then a ladl is placed within them. The left cups symbolize that the moon goddess causes rain and the right cups symbolize that the moon goddess offers soma.
All in all: the above seals show that Kartikeya and Shashthi produce rain and rivers as well as soma.
