Bronze sunrise Sit Shamsi of Susa is visual image of
Veda sacred fire-prayers signified by काण्डर्षितिर्ण
oblations to ancestor equipment makers
Sit Shamsi bronze was discovered in the area of the Ninhursag temple on the Acropole, Susa.
Akkadian name for this Elamite bronze object in an Elamite inscription! based on कार्ण्डषितिर्ण Jaiminīya Sāmaveda tradition. Soma is one of the four कार्ण्डषि ancestors venerated. A synonym of Soma is amśu (RV) cognate ancu 'iron' (Tocharian)
12th century BCE Tell of the Acropolis, Susa J. de Morgan excavations, 1904-05 Sb 2743 Louvre. The base measures 60 X 40 cm. Behind one of the adorants are the following objects:a big jar (H), a water reservoir, two square tubs (I,J),three tree stalks without branches (K),a stèle connected to a platform (M) with raised edges.
Elamite craftsmen diplayed brilliant and new metallurgical techniques for the execution of large monuments, statues and reliefs.

-- Sit Shamshi 'bronze sunrise' of Susa is Vedic कार्ण्डषितिर्ण purification by water oblations & the Sun, veneration of ancestors who created wealth-resources of equipment, etc. An Elamite inscription tells us the name of the piece's royal dedicator and its meaning in part: "I ShilhakInshushinak, son of Shutruk-Nahhunte, beloved servant of Inshushinak, king of Anshan and Susa [...], who made the kingdom grow, protector of Elam, I made a bronze sunrise." The inscription

on the model is in Akkadian. So, Gian Pietro Basello exclaims: "So, an Akkadian name for an Elamite object in an Elamite inscription !" We may add, 'So, an Akkadian name for an Elamite object in an Elamite inscription in the Vedic tradition !!' See the reading of the inscription at http://www.elamit.net/elam/sit_handout.pdf This is how Gian Pietro Basello asks: [quote] Sit Shamshi an Akkadian loan-word in Elamite? "Do you know this object? I hope so. It is perhaps the most stimulating object found in the entire Ancient Near East, even if handbooks on Mesopotamian art do not talk much about it. It is a three-dimensional bronze model whose base measures 60 X 40 cm, excavated in the 1904-05 campaign by the French Mission at Susa. The scene is focused on two squatted human figures: one stretches its hands out, the other seems to be pouring water over them from a jug. Around them, there are possibly some kinds of altars, a large vessel, two basins, a stela and three trunks of trees. This act, perhaps a cultic scene which took place in the second half of the 12th century BCE, was fixed for eternity by will of ShilhakInshushinak (1140-1120 BCE), king of Anshan and Susa, according to the short inscription in a corner of the base. If you are so lucky as to run into a picture of it (unless you are directly visiting the Louvre Museum), looking at the caption you would learn that the name commonly given to this object is sit shamshi. Actually , this name, meaning 'the rising of the sun, sunrise' in Akkadian, appears in lines 5-6 of the inscription. But only in the unlikely event that you are both in front of the Louvre showcase with the sit shamshi in and an 'Elamist', i.e. a specialist in Elamite studies, you could go further in reading the inscription, though even an Elamist, having been ready to interpret the most stereotyped Akkadian inscription -- you know, Akkadian was very spread in Susiana --, so even an Elamist will jolt becoming aware of the language of the text. Apart from brushing up the revered edition by Scheil (1909) or Konig (1965), this is the only way to learn that the inscription is compiled in Elamite language. So, an Akkadian name for an Elamite object in an Elamite inscription!" (Gian Pietro Basello, 2003, Loan-words in Achaemenid Elamite: the spelling of old Persian Month-names, in: 5th European Conf. of Iranian Studies, October 10th 2003 http://digilander.libero.it/elam2/elam/basello_sie2003.pdf ) See: https://www.scribd.com/doc/254053980/Basello-Gian-Pietro-2003-Loan-words-in-AchaemenidElamite-the-spellings-of-old-Persian-month-names[unquote] The 3D Model from Susa called Sit-shamshi: An essay of interpretation
by Gian Pietro Basello
"Sit shamshi is the name used in an inscription of the Middle Elamite king Shilhak-Inshushinak (ca. 1150-1120 BC) to refer to its textual support, a bronze model (base 60 × 40 cm) representing in three dimensions two squatted individuals, one pouring a liquid over the hands of the other, in an open space with buildings, trees and other installations. The common interpretation of this name (meaning ‘sunrise’ in Akkadian) has become also the key for the understanding of the whole scene, supposedly a ritual ceremony to be performed at the sunrise in a sacred precint.
From one hand, I would like to discuss the interpretation of sit shamshi as an Akkadian syntagm, considering that the inscription is written in Elamite and that sit e sham- are also known as Elamite terms. On the other hand, I would like to have feedback from scholars skilled in ritual texts from Mesopotamia, trying also to understand if there is some further element in support of the sunrise ritual interpretation. http://www.academia.edu/1706512/The_3D_Model_from_Susa_called_Sitshamshi_An_essay_of_interpretation

Gian Pietro Basello is justified in his exclamatory and laudaory references to the Sit Shamsi bronze objec. He will be thrilled by the links the object provides to Veda sacred prayers to fire and Sun divinities.
Shilhak-in-Shushinak and ceremony of the sun mentioned on the Akkadian inscription dates the inscription to 12th century BCE. It is possible that the model itself might have been made at an earlier date. One adorant sprinkles water on the palms of another also kneeling in adoration in front. It is a process of purification paralleling the purification of metals in a smelter and a furnace or crucible.
The thesis of this monogra;ph is that a Vedic ceremony of the rising sun is signified on a bronze model with Indus Script hieroglyphs, dated Susa, 12th cent. BCE.
This monograph posits that कार्ण्डषितिर्ण of Veda tradition is offering of water oblations to ancestor equipment makers; is also a veneration of seeking blessings from the rishis and ancestors who are he authors of the काण्ड of the Veda and protectors of dharma tradition.. The monograph demonstrates that this tradition is archaeologically attgested Sit Shamsi bronze model of worship with water oblations, in front of ziggurat-shaped, step-pyramid ziggurat temple and kole.l 'temple, smithy, forge'.
The hieroglyphs on the Sit Shamsi bronze are read rebus as Meluhha hieroglyphs and hypertexts, thus pointing to the presence by migrant artisans and merchants who went out of Sarasvati River Basin into Susa.
Meluhha seafaring merchants and artisans moved into Susa traversing the navigable waterway of Sarasvati River and the maritime seafaring route of Persian Gulf..
-- archaeological evidence for prātaḥsandhyā vandanam 'prayer of sunrise' by metalwork artisans, 12th cent.BCE
-- sit shamsi bronze model is an Indus Script hypertext expressions containing detailed signifiers of metalwork in mint, smithy, forge
-- kole.l 'temple, smithy, forge' to process अष्टन् -लोहकम् 'eight metals'
-- ceremony offering prayers to the Sun takes place in front of the kole.l 'smithy, forge' and kole.l 'temple,ziggurat'
--offering prayers are signified by pouring water as ablations from the hands of the worshippers; the signifier is: काण्ड 'water' rebus: काण्ड 'equipment, arrow'
--offering spaces and structures are signified by a skámbha and four कु ण्डम् kunḍam
-- a large storage pot with a rim is signified rebus: kanda kanka rebus काण्ड

कारणी or कारणीक kāraṇī or kāraṇīka a (कारण S) That causes, conducts, carries on, manages. Applied to the prime minister of a state, the supercargo of a ship;thus, the expression signifies rebus: 'equipment supercargo' (Marathi).
-- काण्डऋर्ष who are specifically offered water oblations are four in number;they are: 1. प्रजा -
र्त 'lord of creatures'; 2. सोम 'personified as one of the most important of Vedic divinities , to whose praise all the 114 hymns of the 9th book of the RV. besides 6 in other books and the whole SV. are dedicated';3. अर्ि 'gold, divinity of fire'; 4. र्िेश्व देिााः 'all the divinities; of a class of
deceased ancestors'. Collectively, the four काण्डऋर्ष constitute the रत्नी and देिजी. I submit that
the water oblations offered to four specific कार्ण्डषि signify prayers to wealth resource creators,



6
i.e. those who have pioneered production of metal equipment and embedded gemstones and lapidary jewellery such as those signified by two unique hieroglyphs: monkey dressed as woman and monkey dressed as man:: रत्नी ratnī f (रत्न ) In monkey-sports. A term given to the female
monkey habited as a woman; देिजी or देिजीधसाडा dēvajī or dēvajīdhasāḍā or ड्या m A name given to the male monkey (in monkey-sports) which is accoutred as a man. The female is termed रत्नी . धसाडा dhasāḍā a Coarse and thick--thread, grass, कड- बा &c; m A piece of stubble, a stub, stump, snag. The two hieroglyphs signifying monkeys dressed as woman and man and offered as wealth tributes of gems and precious stones are seen on the Black Obelisk inscription of Shalamaneseer III together with four friezes of wealth resource signifier hieroglyphs, rebus: karba, ib 'iron': Ta. ayil iron. Ma. ayir, ayiram any ore. Ka. aduru native metal. Tu. ajirda karba very hard iron.(DEDR 192)
-- काण्डऋर्ष तिर्ण are annual celebrations venerating sages in the Jaiminīya Sāmaveda tradition
because one of the four ऋर्ष specifically offered water oblutions is Soma. I submit that this Sāmaveda tradition of venerating ancestors who processed Soma as wealth is exemplified by the water oblations ceremony represented in visual images on the hieroglyph narratives of Sit Shamsi bronze. The central narrative is offering of kāṇḍa 'water' to Sun divinity. The rebus rendering of kāṇḍa 'water' is rebus: kāṇḍa 'bow and arrow (implements)'. Thus, काण्डऋर्ष तिर्ण is celebrated on Sit Shamsi bronze narratives as veneration of ancestors who made metalwork products as wealth-producers for the community.

Does the काण्ड 'arrow' memorial stele topped by two śikhara (ziggurat) signify veneration of
Veda tradition of कार्ण्डषितिर्ण water oblations and Veda sacred fire-prayers? The answer lies in the meanings conveyed by Sit Shamsi bronze of 12th cent. BCE -- documenting bronze age metalwork processes, producing काण्ड 'equipment'. The stele (Figure H below) shown on Sit Shamsi is comparable to the śivalinga discovered by MS Vats in Harappa.

There are two ziggurats: one is a dagoba (dhatugarbha) in three tiers, the other is a kuThi 'smelter'. Two linga stambhas flank the ziggurat. In front of the ziggurat is a table with six narrow hollows, perhaps to hold flagposts or bronze standards comparable to those taken on processions shown on cylinder seals or Indus Script tablets. The ziggurat is flanked by 8 round objects, 4 on either side as offerings of bronze bun-ingots to the divine. Also flanking the ziggurat are two linga stambhas.

Ziggurat on Sit Shamsi and veneration of karandi 'fire-god' (Remo)
Ziggurat on Sit Shamsi is a multi-tiered pyramid temple, flanked by two skambha and two rows of four wedges.

Rebus: loh ‘copper’ (Santali) The glyphic representations connote a guild of coppersmiths in front of a ziggurat, temple and is a veneration of ancestors. The authors of the bronze model seem to have interacted with the groups of artisans of Mohenjo-daro who had a ziggurat in front of the ‘great bath’.

Three stakes on Sit-Shamshi bronze.
Three jagged sticks on the Sit Shamshi bronze, in front of the water tank (Great Bath replica?) If the sticks are orthographic representations of 'forked sticks' and if the underlying language is Meluhha (mleccha), the borrowed or substratum lexemes which may provide a rebus reading are:
kolmo 'three'; rebus; kolami 'smithy' (Telugu)
Glyph: मेंढा [ mēṇḍhā ] A crook or curved end (of a stick, horn &c.) and
attrib. such a stick, horn, bullock. मेढा [ mēḍhā ] m A stake, esp. as forked. meḍ(h), meḍhī f., meḍhā m. ʻ post, forked stake ʼ.(Marathi)(CDIAL 10317) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.) Vikalpa: P. khuṇḍ, °ḍā m. ʻ peg, stump ʼ; khuṇṭ ‘stump’. Rebus: 1. khũṭ ‘community, guild’ (Mu.) 2. Skt. kuṇḍa- round hole in ground (for water or sacred fire).
Thus, three jagged sticks on the Sit Shamshi bronze may be decoded as khũṭ
kolami ‘smithy guild’ or, kuṇḍa kollami ‘sacred fire smithy’ or, meḍ kolami 'iron (metal) smithy'. 'Iron' in such lexical entries may refer to 'metal'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=3WfuhPYTP0s
