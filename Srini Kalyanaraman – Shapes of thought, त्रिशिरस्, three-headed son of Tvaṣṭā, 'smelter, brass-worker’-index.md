Tvaṣṭā (त्वʼा ).—A Prajāpati. This Prajāpati was an asura also. (Sūkta 94, Anuvāka 14, Maṇḍala 1, Ṛgveḍa). Birth. There are contradictory statements in the Purāṇas regarding the birth of Tvaṣṭā. (See full article at Story of Tvaṣṭā from the Puranic encyclopaedia by Vettam Mani). Tvaṣṭā (ष्टत्वा ) is the name of one of the twelve Ādityas: the offspring of Aditi, according to one account of Vaṃśa (‘genealogical description’) of the 10th century Saurapurāṇa: one of the various Upapurāṇas depicting Śaivism.
Tvashta, also called Bhaumana is the divine carpenter. He is the father of Saranyu (the wife of Vivasvant) and the grand-father of the primeval twins Yama and Yami. The Rig Veda calls him the 'artificer' of the Gods. He does not have a whole hymn dedicated to him in the Rig Veda, but is mentioned in conjunction with other deities in [R.V.1.13], [R.V.2.1] etc. He is said to be the most skillful of workmen, having fashioned the bolt of Indra and a drinking-cup for the Gods. He is the guardian of Soma (Amrit), which is called the food of Tvashta. Indra drinks Soma at Tvashta's house.
Tvashta is also thought to be the same as Vishwakarma. (who is the divine architect, and who has a daughter who married the sun god Surya)

Tvaṣṭa (त्वʼ ):—mfn. (√tvakṣ) = taṣṭa, [cf. Lexicographers, esp. such as amarasiṃha, halāyudha, hemacandra, etc.] Tvaṣṭa (డ౷ లౣ ):—[adjective] trimmed and smoothened with or as with an adze (said of wood).
Pāṇini-Śikṣā. 52. The story concerning “indra-satru” is told in the Taittirīya-Saṃhitā 2-4-12 as follows: Tvaṣṭā, “the Vulcan of the Hindus,” whose son had been slain by Indra, prepared to get up the Soma sacrifice without Indra. The latter wished for an invitation for it, but Tvaṣṭā would not invite him, who had slain his son. Then Indra interrupted the sacrifice and forcibly drank away the Soma juice. Thereupon Tvaṣṭā poured into the fire an oblation of the Soma juice that then remained, praying “O Agni, grow up into an Indra-satru.” Thence rose a person, named Vṛtra, who began to extend his form rapidly over the three regions of the earth, the interspace and heaven. Tvaṣṭā was afraid of his growing power and gave Indra a
consecrated weapon to kill him with. With this weapon and with the whole strength of Viṣṇu at his back, Indra was able to draw away the whole strength of Vṛtra into himself and
Viṣṇu, when Vṛtra became absorbed in Indra’s body. Tvaṣṭā of course prayed that the person should prove Indra’s destroyer; but, as he had mispronounced “Indra-satru,” with udātta
(acute accent or high tone) on the first instead of on the last syllable, the result was quite the contrary.
Taittiriya Upanishad
by A. Mahadeva Sastri | 1903 |
Study of Phonetics
ͦ शीक्ां ʩाख्या˟ामिः ͡ वणषिः sरिः ͡ मात्रा बलम् ͡ साम सन्तानिः ͡ इुत्यक्तिः शीक्ाध्यायिः ͢
oṃ śīkṣāṃ vyākhyāsyāmaḥ | varṇaḥ svaraḥ | mātrā balam | sāma santānaḥ | ityuktaḥ śīkṣādhyāyaḥ ||
Om! We shall treat of the phonetics: sound, rhythm, quantity, strength, modulation, union. Thus has been declared the lesson on phonetics.
Phonetics (Śikṣā) is the science which treats of sounds and their pronunciation. Or, the word ‘śikṣā’ may here signify the sounds etc., which are treated of in that science. Sound: such as ‘ā’. Rhythm: such as udātta or high-pitched tone. Length: short, long, etc. Strength: intensity of effort. Modulation: pronunciation of sounds in the middle tone. Union: conjunction of several sounds.—These are the things to be learnt. Thus far is the lesson on phonetics, in these Words the Upaniṣad concludes the present subject with a view to proceed to the next.
For him who, by the recitation of the mantra given in the first anuvāka, has removed
obstacles, it is proper to proceed with the text treating of the ways of contemplation and
of the nature of Brahman. As the text of the Upaniṣad is mainly intended for a knowledge of the things therein treated of, one should spare no pains in learning the text; and accordingly
the Upaniṣad proceeds with a lesson on phonetics. Here one may ask, what if one be careless? We reply: carelessness will lead to evil. It has been said, “The Mantra, when wanting in rhythm or sound, or when wrongly used, conveys not the intended idea. That thunderbolt
of speech will ruin the worshipper as the word ‘indra-śatru’ did owing to a fault in rhythm”]
Two antelopes are put next to the hayrick on the platform of the seal on which the horned person is seated. mlekh 'goat' (Br.); rebus: milakku 'copper' (Pali); mleccha 'copper' (Skt.) Thus, the composition of glyphs on the platform: pair of antelopes + pair of hayricks read rebus: milakku kundār 'copper turner'.

Noting the semantics ‘merchant’ and ‘metallurgist’, Forbes notes:“...like the mercatores of the Middle Ages who were often both artisans and merchants at the same time. Hence the trade was only partly a State-affair and dam-gar (tamkaru) was allowed a certain latitude to do some business of his own. Hence the lots of 6-12 talents of metal sometimes go to the eDUB-ba, the State storehouse, also called ‘house of the silver and the lapis lazuli, the great storehouse’. Several tons of copper were consumed yearly in each Sumerian town and the

gold-smith’s shops seem to have worked some 6K of red gold, 8K of refined gold and nearly 6K of silver in one year.” (RJ Forbes, 1964, Studies in ancient technology, Volume I, EJ Brill., p.86).

There is a possibility that this seal impression from Haft Tepe had some connections with Indian hieroglyphs. This requires further investigation.
“From Haft Tepe (Middle Elamite period, ca. 13th century) in Ḵūzestān an unusual pyrotechnological installation was associated with a craft workroom containing such materials as mosaics of colored stones framed in bronze, a dismembered elephant skeleton used in manufacture of bone tools, and several hundred bronze arrowpoints and small tools. “Situated in a courtyard directly in front of this
workroom is a most unusual kiln. This kiln is very large, about 8 m long and 2 and one half m wide, and contains two long compartments with chimneys at each end, separated by a fuel chamber in the middle. Although the roof of the kiln had collapsed, it is evident from the slight inturning of the walls which remain in situ that it was barrel vaulted like the roofs of the tombs. Each of the two long heating chambers is divided into eight sections by partition walls. The southern heating chamber contained metallic slag, and was apparently used for making bronze objects. The northern heating chamber contained pieces of broken pottery and other material, and thus was apparently used for baking clay objects including tablets . . .”

A gold disc is now in al-Sabah collection of Dar al-Atharal-Islamiyyah (Kuwait National Museum). This gold disc is a veritable metalwork catalogue, consistent with the entire Indus Script Corpora as catalogus catalogorum of metalwork.
Two types of antelopes are shown, both with heads turned back. One pair has thrown-back horns; the other pair has two bifurcating curved horns. The orthographic intent is to distinguish two distinct word and related semantics of markhor and goat-antelope.

HYMN VIII. Agni. 8
1. AGNI advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens. He hath attained the skys' supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the lap of waters. 2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and neverceasing- Calf hath bellowed. Bringing our offerings to the Gods' assembly, he moves as Chief in his own dwellingplaces-. 3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre. In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of Order. 4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins' illuminator. For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest Mitra. 5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varuna when to sacrifice thou comest. Thou art the Waters Child O Jatavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest. 6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest, Thy lightbestowing- head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the oblationbearer, Agni. 7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sires' intention, Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes forth to combat. 8 Wellskilled- to use the weapons of his Father, Aptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle.



16
Then Trita slew the foe sevenrayed-, threeheaded-, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tvastar. 9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty. He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the oniniform Son of Tvastar.
HYMN IX. Waters. 9
1. YE, Waters, are beneficent: so help ye us to energy That we may look on great delight. 2 Give us a portion of the sap, the most auspicious that ye have, Like mothers in their longing love. 3 To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on; And, Waters, give us procreant strength. 4 The Waters. be to us for drink, Goddesses for our aid and bliss: Let them stream to us health and strength. 5 1 beg the Floods to give us balm, these Queens who rule over precious things, And have supreme control of men. 6 Within the WatersSoma- thus hath told medwell- all balms that heal, And Agni, he who blesseth all. 7 O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm, So that I long may see the Sun. 8 Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought, If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me. 9 The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come: O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.

Wilson translation RV 10.8.7 to 9
10.008.07 Trita by (his own), desiring a share (of the sacrifice), for the sake of taking part in the exploit of the supreme protector (of the world), chose (Indra as his friend); attended (by the priests) in the proximity of the parental heaven and earth, and reciting appropriate praise, he takes up his weapons. [Legend: Indra said to Trita, 'You are skiled in the weapons of all; aid me in killing Tris'iras the son of Tvas.t.a_'. Trita agreed on condition of having a share in the sacrifices offered to Indra. Indra gave him water to wash his hands with and a share in the sacrifice, whereby Trita's strength increased; seven-rayed: i.e., seven-tongued, seven-rayed, like the sun, or seven-handed]. 10.008.08 He, the son of the waters, incited by Indra, skilled in his paternal weapons, fought against (the enemy), and slew the seven-rayed, three-headed (asura); then Trita set free the cows of the son of Tvas.t.a_. 10.008.09 Indra, the protector of the virtuous, crushed the arrogant (foe), attaining vast strenth; shouting, he cut off the three heads of the multiform son of Tvas.t.a_ (the lord) of cattle. [Shouting: s'abdam kurvan; gona_m acakra_n.ah, appropriating the cattle].
Griffith RV 10.8.1. AGNI advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens.



24
He hath attained the skys' supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the lap of waters. 2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and neverceasing- Calf hath bellowed. Bringing our offerings to the Gods' assembly, he moves as Chief in his own dwellingplaces-. 3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre. In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of Order. 4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins' illuminator. For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest Mitra. 5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varuna when to sacrifice thou comest. Thou art the Waters Child O Jatavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest. 6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest, Thy lightbestowing- head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the oblationbearer, Agni. 7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sires' intention, Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes forth to combat. 8 Wellskilled- to use the weapons of his Father, Aptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle. Then Trita slew the foe sevenrayed-, threeheaded-, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tvastar. 9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty. He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the oniniform Son of Tvastar.

Rebus readings from R. in two parts of hypertext. Part 1 (with four hieroglyphs):
Sign 1 (Mahadevan concordance)
1. meḍ 'body' rebus: meḍ 'iron' med 'copper' (Slavic) karṇaka 'spread legs' rebus: karṇī 'supercargo, merchant's responsible for the cargo of shipment')
2. ḍato =claws of crab (Santali) Rebus: dhātu 'mineral ore'.
3. kāru pincers, tongs. Rebus: khār खार् 'blacksmith' (Kashmiri)
4. sal stake, spike, splinter, thorn, difficulty (H.); sal ‘workshop’ (Santali) PLUS Glyph of ‘rim of jar’: kárṇaka m. ʻ projection on the side of a vessel, handle ʼ ŚBr. [kárṇa -- ]Pa. kaṇṇaka -- ʻ having ears or corners ʼ; (CDIAL 2831) kaṇḍa kanka; Rebus: furnace account

(Telugu) káraṇa n. ʻ act, deed ʼ RV. [√k ̥r1] Pa. karaṇa -- n. ʻdoingʼ; NiDoc. karana, kaṁraṁna ʻworkʼ; Pk. karaṇa -- n. ʻinstrumentʼ(CDIAL 2790) karNI 'Supercargo'. Thus, cargo handed/accounted from workshop account to supercargo.
Part 2 with two hieroglyhs:
5. aya 'fish' Rebus: aya 'iron' (Gujarati); ayas 'metal' (Rigveda).PLUS khambhaṛā ʻfinʼ rebus:kammaTa 'mint, coiner, coinage'
6. PLUS kanka, karNaka 'rim of jar' rebus:karNI 'Supercargo' karNaka 'account,scribe'. Thus, this second part of the hypertext reads: Mintwork account (to) Supercargo, a representative of



29
the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale.
Thus, seal m0304 Mohenjo-daro is a comprehensive metalwork catalogue of a mint documenting, using dharma saṁjñā 'responsibility markers or hieroglyphs, the tasks assigned to kuṇḍi-a = village headman' ; leader of a village (Pkt.lex.) i.e. śreṇi jet.t.ha chief of metalworker guild.
This is an unambiguous, remarkable example proving that Indus Script is a knowledge system. There are over 7000 inscriptions on Indus Script Corpora detailing the technical specifications of the knowledge system which facilitated trade/exchange transactions by seafaring merchants of Meluhha.
Shapes of thought of Tvaṣṭ ̥r’s Germanic People and Bhāratam Janam, Indus Script, 3rd millennium BCE
-- Shared artificers’ wealth creation heritage
Takṣa,Tvāṣṭra, and Tuisco, Tuisto are cognates. It is impossible to posit the direction of borrowing of these tadbhava expressions. Both sets of expressions are Indus Script hypertexts and occur on inscriptions and in temple sculptural friezes.
The monograph is organized in two sections:
Section A. Tvastr =Tuisto, Takṣa =Tuisco
Section B. triśiras tvāṣṭra, Viśvarūpa, Divine fashioner of Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12); Tuisto, Tuisco Divine ancestor of Germanic people

Wilson translation: RV1.13.10 I invoke the chief and multiform Tvaṣṭ ̥r (= Viśvakarmā); may he be solely ours. Sāyaṇa explains: Tvasṭā = Viśvakarmā, artificer of the gods, the fabricator of the original sacrificial vase or ladleTvasṭā vai paśūnām mithunānām rūpak ̥rt---iti śruteh (Taittirīya.Samhitā 6.1.8.5):
Tvasṭā forms in animals in pairs. This remarkable elucidation seems to anticipate the characteristic hieroglyphic multiplex forms -- particularly antithetical, pairs -- of composite animals used repeatedly in Indus Script Corpora. This characteristic pairing seems to be reflected in the explanation for the cognate word Tuisto in Germania--as derived from tvai 'two'.Alternative translation: Prasanna Chandra Gautam:
I call Tvasṭā with many forms place in front near here. Let him only be ours.
Section A. Tvastr =Tuisto, Takṣa =Tuisco

Neo-Assyrian Agate Cylinder Seal, 8th-7th Century BC Engraved with two scenes; the first shows a triple or four-faced bearded god (god of the four winds?) in a winged solar disc above a Sacred Tree or Tree of Life, a bull above each wing, with standing bull-men flanking the tree.

The second scene shows a bearded hero standing upon an ibex, holding two winged lions by a hind leg, a bird perched on their tails, with a star on either side, and a running ibex on either side below.

HYMN VIII. Agni. 8
1. AGNI advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens. He hath attained the skys' supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the lap of waters. 2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and neverceasing- Calf hath bellowed. Bringing our offerings to the Gods' assembly, he moves as Chief in his own dwellingplaces-. 3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly



36
lustre. In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of Order. 4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins' illuminator. For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest Mitra. 5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varuna when to sacrifice thou comest. Thou art the Waters Child O Jatavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest. 6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest, Thy lightbestowing- head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the oblationbearer, Agni. 7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sires' intention, Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes forth to combat. 8 Wellskilled- to use the weapons of his Father, Aptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle. Then Trita slew the foe sevenrayed-, threeheaded-, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tvastar. 9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty. He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the oniniform Son of Tvastar.
HYMN IX. Waters. 9
1. YE, Waters, are beneficent: so help ye us to energy That we may look on great delight. 2 Give us a portion of the sap, the most auspicious that ye have, Like mothers in their longing love. 3 To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on; And, Waters, give us procreant strength. 4 The Waters. be to us for drink, Goddesses for our aid and bliss: Let them stream to us health and strength. 5 1 beg the Floods to give us balm, these Queens who rule over precious things, And have supreme control of men. 6 Within the WatersSoma- thus hath told medwell- all balms that heal, And Agni, he who blesseth all. 7 O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm, So that I long may see the Sun. 8 Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought, If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me. 9 The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come: O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.

Cyprus produced cylinder seals only during the late 2nd millennium BC. These seals combine Syrian and Mesopotamian imagery in a uniquely Cypriot fashion. In this example, female figures wearing crowns hold long-necked animals in a pose derived from the Mesopotamian composition called "mistress of animals." The bead-like decoration on the dresses and the wings are also characteristic of Cypriot seals. between 1400 and 1150 BC (late Cypriot) carved hematite

"Cyprus produced cylinder seals only during the late 2nd millennium BCE. These seals combine Syrian and Mesopotamian imagery in a uniquely Cypriot fashion. In this example, female figures wearing crowns hold long-necked animals in a pose derived from the Mesopotamian composition called "mistress of animals." The bead-like decoration on the dresses and the wings are also characteristic of Cypriot seals. Cylinder seals are cylindrical objects carved in reverse (intaglio) in order to leave raised impressions when rolled into clay. Seals were generally used to mark ownership, and they could act as official identifiers, like a signature, for individuals and institutions. A seal’s owner rolled impressions in wet clay to



40
secure property such as baskets, letters, jars, and even rooms and buildings. This clay sealing prevented tampering because it had to be broken in order to access a safeguarded item. Cylinder seals were often made of durable material, usually stone, and most were drilled
lengthwise so they could be strung and worn. A seal’s material and the images inscribed on the seal itself could be protective. The artistry and design might be appreciated and considered decorative as well. Cylinder seals were produced in the Near East beginning in the fourth millennium BCE and date to every period through the end of the first millennium BCE." https://art.thewalters.org/detail/18369/cylinder-seal-with-rows-of-genii/
Five Indus Script inscriptions from Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization depict a multi-headed Divinity seated in a classic Yogic posture -- a Ganweriwala clay tablet, four seals --m305, m453, m1181 and m304. All the five inscriptions signify a person seated on a platform in yogic posture, in penance or meditation. Of these, m1181 and m304 clearly, legibly signify a hypertext, ligatured composition of three faces or heads which in Hindu tradition is called tri śiras, 'three-headed'. A sixth Indus Script inscription h1971B shows a horned, seated person.
. Plano convex molded tablet showing an individual spearing a water buffalo with one foot pressing the head down and one arm holding the tip of a horn. A gharial is depicted above the sacrifice scene and a figure seated in yogic position, wearing a horned headdress, looks on. The horned headdress has a branch with three prongs or leaves emerging from the center. One side of a planoconvex molded tablet found in 1995 in Mound ET at Harappa. Mark Kenoyer writes about his narrative scene depicting the killing of a water buffalo: "A person, possibly a man, with hair tied in a bun on the back of the head, impales a water buffalo with a barbed spear. The hunter's foot presses down on the water buffalo's head as he thrusts the spear into its shoulder. In Later Hindu rituals, the water buffalo sacrifice is associated with the worship of the goddess Durga, but on this seal the sacrifice takes place in the presence of a priest or deity seated in yogic position. The seated figure wears bangles and a horned and



41
plumed headdress. Above the head of the hunter is a gharial, a small species of crocodile with a narrow snout that was once common in the Ravi and Indus rivers, but is now almost extinct. Similar scenes of an individual spearing a water buffalo have been found on other terracotta tablets from both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro."(Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, pp. 114-5).

kaṇḍa karṇaka 'rim of jar'; rebus: 'furnace scribe (account)'. Thus the inscription reads rebus: iron, iron (metal) workshop, copper (mineral) guild, fire-altar (furnace) scribe (account workshop), metal furnace scribe (account) As the decoding of m0304 seal demonstrates, the Indus hieroglyphs are the professional repertoire of an artisan (miners'/metalworkers') guild detailing the stone/mineral/metal resources/furnaces/smelters of workshops (smithy/forge/turners' shops).
In fact we encounter this exact same posture in later depictions, long after collapse of Harappan civilization. For instance we have here is a coin from Ujjain dated to 2nd-1st century BCE depicting multi-headed Lord Shiva seated in same Yogic posture.
m1181 Square seal depicting a nude male deity with three faces, seated in yogic position on a throne, wearing bangles on both arms and an elaborate headdress. Five symbols of the Indus script appear on either side of the headdress which is made of two outward projecting buffalo style curved horns, with two upward projecting points. A single branch with three pipal leaves rises from the middle of the headdress. Seven bangles are depicted on the left arm and six on the right, with the hands resting on the knees. The heels are pressed together under the groin and the feet project beyond the edge of the throne. The feet of the throne are carved with the hoof of a bovine as is seen on the bull and unicorn seals. The seal may not have been fired, but the stone is very hard. A grooved and perforated boss is present on the back of the seal.

Wilson translation RV 10.8.7 to 9
10.008.07 Trita by (his own), desiring a share (of the sacrifice), for the sake of taking part in the exploit of the supreme protector (of the world), chose (Indra as his friend); attended (by the priests) in the proximity of the parental heaven and earth, and reciting appropriate praise, he takes up his weapons. [Legend: Indra said to Trita, 'You are skiled in the weapons of all; aid me in killing Tris'iras the son of Tvas.t.a_'. Trita agreed on condition of having a share in the sacrifices offered to Indra. Indra gave him water to wash his hands with and a share in the sacrifice, whereby Trita's strength increased; seven-rayed: i.e., seven-tongued, seven-rayed, like the sun, or seven-handed]. 10.008.08 He, the son of the waters, incited by Indra, skilled in his paternal weapons, fought against (the enemy), and slew the seven-rayed, three-headed (asura); then Trita set free the cows of the son of Tvas.t.a_. 10.008.09 Indra, the protector of the virtuous, crushed the arrogant (foe), attaining vast strenth; shouting, he cut off the three heads of the multiform son of Tvas.t.a_ (the lord) of cattle. [Shouting: s'abdam kurvan; gona_m acakra_n.ah, appropriating the cattle].
Griffith RV 10.8.1. AGNI advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens.
He hath attained the skys' supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the lap of waters. 2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and neverceasing- Calf hath bellowed. Bringing our offerings to the Gods' assembly, he moves as Chief in his own dwellingplaces-. 3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre. In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of Order. 4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins' illuminator. For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest Mitra. 5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varuna when to sacrifice thou comest. Thou art the Waters Child O Jatavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest. 6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest, Thy lightbestowing- head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the oblationbearer, Agni. 7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sires' intention, Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes forth to combat. 8 Wellskilled- to use the weapons of his Father, Aptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle. Then Trita slew the foe sevenrayed-, threeheaded-, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tvastar. 9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty. He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the oniniform Son of Tvastar.

About Germanic tribes, Tacitus (56-120 CE), senator and historian of Roman Empire, wrote
in Germania (in De origine et situ Germanorum):
The Germans themselves I should regard as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive; and the boundless and, so to speak, hostile ocean beyond us, is seldom entered by a sail from our world. And, beside the perils of rough and unknown seas, who would leave Asia, or Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past, they celebrate an earth-born god, Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ingævones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Istævones. (Complete Works of Tacitus. Tacitus. Alfred John Church. William Jackson Brodribb. Lisa Cerrato. edited for Perseus. New York. : Random House, Inc. Random House, Inc. reprinted 1942, p.2). http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text
"In ancient days, their only type of historical tradition, they celebrate Tuisto, a god brought forth from the earth. They attribute to him a son, Mannus, the source and founder of their people, and to Mannus three sons, from whose names those nearest the Ocean are called Ingvaeones, those in the middle Herminones, and the rest Istvaeones. Some people, inasmuch as antiquity gives free rein to speculation, maintain that there were more sons born from the god and hence more tribal designations—Marsi, Gambrivii, Suebi, and Vandilii—and that those names are genuine and ancient." (Germania, chapter 2;Tales of the Barbarians: Ethnography and Empire in the Roman West, p. 40, Greg Woolf, John Wiley & Sons; loc. cit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannus).
Tuesday (n.) third day of the week, Old English tiwesdæg, from Tiwes, genitive of Tiw "Tiu," from Proto-Germanic *Tiwaz "god of the sky," the original supreme deity of ancient Germanic mythology, differentiated specifically as Tiu, ancient Germanic god of war, from PIE *deiwos "god," from root *dyeu- "to shine" (see diurnal). Compare Old Frisian tiesdei, Old Norse tysdagr, Swedish tisdag, Old High German ziestag. http://etymonline.com/index.php It is significant that, according to Tacitus, the Germanic peoples celebrate the earthborn god, Tuisco (variant Tuisto), a name derived from Rigveda, Tvaṣṭā, Tvaṣṭṛ, the divine artificer, born of Viśvakarma, the divine architect, artisan.

Visvakarman. 81 1. HE who sate down as Hotarpriest-, the Rsi, our Father, offering up all things existing, He, seeking through his wish a great possession, came among men on earth as archetypal. 2 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that supported him? How was it? Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with mighty power disclosed the heavens. 3 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on all sides, arms and feet on all sides, He, the Sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them, with his arms as wings, together. 4 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven? Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things. 5 Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy midmost- here, O Visvakarman, Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thyself, exalted, to our worship. 6 Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and Heaven to worship. Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron. 7 Let us invoke today-, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the thoughtswift- Visvakarman. May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid, whose works are righteous.

Visvakarman. 82 1. THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness. Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the earth were far extended. 2 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence. Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven Rsis. 3 Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races and all things existing, Even he alone, the Deities' narnegiverhim-, other beings seek for information. 4 To him in sacrifice they offered treasures, Rsis of old, in numerous troops, as singers, Who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all these things that have existence. 5 That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the Asuras and Gods had being, What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Gods were seen together? 6 The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together.

1. THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness. Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the earth were far extended. 2 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence. Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven Rsis. 3 Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races and all things existing, Even he alone, the Deities' narnegiverhim-, other beings seek for information. 4 To him in sacrifice they offered treasures, Rsis of old, in numerous troops, as singers, Who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all these things that have existence. 5 That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the Asuras and Gods had being, What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Gods were seen together? 6 The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together. It rested set upon the Unborns' navel, that One wherein abide all things existing. 7 Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another thing hath risen up among you. Enwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymnchanters- wander and are discontented. Tvaṣṭā, is the heavenly builder, the maker of divine implements, especially Indra's Vajra and the guardian of Soma.

moreover, a doubtful legend is told of his having offered up all beings, including himself, in sacrifice; the Rāmāyaṇa represents him as having built the city of Laṅkā for the Rākṣasas, and as having generated the ape Nala, who made Rāma’s bridge from the continent to the island; the name Viśva-karman, meaning ‘doing all acts’, appears to be sometimes applicable as an epithet to any great divinity), [Ṛg-veda] etc. etc. (Monier-Williams) Source: McGill: The architectural theory of the Mānasāra
Viśvakarman (तवwकमषन्).—According to the Mānasāra II.2-4, the proper name of the deity is Viśvakarman (which means “forger of the universe”), of which lokakṛt, meaning “worldmaker,” is a synonym. There is great respect reserved in the text for this deity, evident from the adjective mahat, “great,” that is prefixed to this name.
References to the deity Viśvakarman are found from the Ṛgveda onwards, usually in connection with cosmogony. He was the “patron” of manual labor and the mechanical arts
and, therefore, worshipped with great reverence by guilds of artisans. Next, the text mentions that Viśvakarman is also known as Īśvara, “Lord”. The notion of “lordship” of the deity belongs ta a devotional religiosity that implies a personal relationship between deity and devotee. Thus, Viśvakarman is not only maker of the world, but a1so personal lord of devotees.
Viśvakarman is said to he born with four faces. Each face has a name that signifies a
particular role which seems to be an attempt ta further delineate the different aspects of the grand process of cosmic generation. Thus, the eastern face is called viśvabhū, literally, “the world-born one”, here to mean the one who grants the world its existence; the southern face, viśvavid, “the world-knowing one”; the northern face, viśvastha, “the world-establishing one”; and the western face, viśvasraṣṭā, “the one who is maker of the world”.
From the eastern face of Viśvakarman was born (also) Viśvakarman; from the southern face, Maya; from the northern face, Tvaṣṭṛ; and from the western face, Manu. The four members of the builder’s guild, namely sthapati, “master-builder”, sūtragrāhin, “cord-bearer”, vardhaki,



70
“stone-cutter”, and takṣaka, “carpenter”, are said to the sons of Viśvakarman, Maya, Tvaṣṭṛr and Manu respectively.

"King Shaushtatar (ruled c. 1430) extended the boundaries of Mitanni through the conquest of Alalakh, Nuzi, Assur, and Kizzuwatna. Egypt, under Tuthmosis III (1479-1425 BCE), defeated the Mitanni at Aleppo after a long period of contention over control of the region of Syria. Later Egyptian dynasties entered into pacts and treaties with Mitanni and the daughter of the Mitanni King Tushratta, the princess Taduhepa, was given in marriage to Amenhotep III (1391-1353 BCE) as part of a treaty which balanced power between the two nations.This treaty was put to the test during a power struggle in Washukanni between Tushratta and a relative of the previous king, Shuttarna, known as Artatama II. Egypt backed Tushratta in this conflict while the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I backed Artatama II. Tushratta seemed poised to succeed when Egypt, fearing the growing power of the Hittites, withdrew its support. Suppiluliuma I, tired of diplomacy and now free to do as he pleased without fear of Egyptian reprisal, led his forces on Washukanni and sacked it. Tushratta was assassinated by his son, perhaps in an effort to save the city. Following this conquest, Mitanni was ruled by Hittite kings."http://www.ancient.eu/Mitanni/ The name Tushratta may also be a phonetic variant of Tvaṣṭ ̥r, Tuisto. Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni is postulated.
"In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni (between Suppiluliuma and Shattiwaza, ca. 1380 BC), the deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya (Ashvins) are invoked.Kikkuli's horse training text (circa 1400 BC) includes technical terms such as aika (Vedic Sanskrit eka, one), tera (tri, three), panza (pañca, five), satta (sapta, seven), na (nava,
nine), vartana (vartana, round). The numeral aika "one" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper (Vedic Sanskrit eka, with regular contraction of /ai/ to [eː]) as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has *aiva; compare Vedic eva "only") in general. Another text has babru(-nnu) (babhru,
brown), parita(-nnu) (palita, grey), and pinkara(-nnu) (pingala, red). Another text
has babru(-nnu) (babhru, brown), parita(-nnu) (palita, grey), and pinkara(-nnu) (pingala,
red). Their chief festival was the celebration of the solstice (vishuva) which was common in most cultures in the ancient world. The Mitanni warriors were called marya (Hurrian: maria
nnu), the term for (young) warrior in Sanskrit as well;[1] note mišta-nnu (= miẓḍha,~ Sanskrit mīḍha) "payment (for catching a fugitive)" (Mayrhofer II 358). Sanskritic interpretations of Mitanni names render Artashumara (artaššumara) as Arta-smara "who thinks of Arta/Ṛta" (Mayrhofer II 780), Biridashva (biridašṷa, biriiašṷa) as Prītāśva "whose horse is dear" (Mayrhofer II 182), Priyamazda (priiamazda) as Priyamedha "whose wisdom is dear" (Mayrhofer II 189, II378), Citrarata as citraratha "whose chariot is shining" (Mayrhofer I 553), Indaruda/Endaruta as Indrota "helped by Indra" (Mayrhofer I 134), Shativaza
(šattiṷaza) as Sātivāja "winning the race price" (Mayrhofer II 540, 696), Šubandhu as
Subandhu 'having good relatives" (a name in Palestine, Mayrhofer II 209, 735), Tushratta (tṷišeratta, tušratta, etc.) as *tṷaišaratha, Vedic Tveṣaratha "whose chariot is vehement"

About German tribes Tacitus wrote:”In ancient days, their only type of historical tradition, they celebrate Tuisto, a god brought forth from the earth. They attribute to him a son, Mannus, the source and founder of their people, and to Mannus three sons, from whose names those nearest the Ocean are called Ingvaeones, those in the middle Herminones, and the rest Istvaeones. Some people, inasmuch as antiquity gives free rein to speculation, maintain that there were more sons born from the god and hence more tribal designationsMarsi, Gambrivii, Suebi, and Vandilii—and that those names are genuine and ancient.
(Germania, chapter 2).”( Tales of the Barbarians: Ethnography and Empire in the Roman West, p. 40, Greg Woolf, John Wiley & Sons.) Note: Germania, written by the Roman historian Publius Cornelius Tacitus around 98 CE and originally entitled On the Origin and Situation of the Germans, is a historical and ethnographic work on the Germanic peoples outside the RomanEmpire.
The Germania begins with a description of the lands, laws, and customs of the Germanic people (chapters 1–27); it then describes individual peoples, beginning with those dwelling



79
closest to Roman lands and ending on the uttermost shores of the Baltic, among the ambergathering Aesti, the Fenni, and the unknown peoples beyond them.
Tacitus says (chapter 2) that physically, the Germanic peoples appear to be a distinct nation, not an admixture of their neighbors, since nobody would desire to migrate to a climate as horrid as that of Germania. They are divided into three large branches, the Ingaevones, the Irminones, and the Istaevones, deriving their ancestry from three sons of Mannus, son of Tuisto, their common forefather.
In chapter 4, he mentions that they all have common physical characteristics, blue eyes (truces et caerulei oculi = "sky-coloured, azure, dark blue, dark green"), reddish hair (rutilae comae = "red, golden-red, reddish yellow"), and large bodies, vigorous at the first onset but
not tolerant of exhausting labour, tolerant of hunger and cold, but not of heat or thirst.[1]
In chapter 7, Tacitus describes their government and leadership as somewhat merit-based and egalitarian, with leadership by example rather than authority, and punishments are carried out by the priests. He mentions (chapter 8) that the opinions of women are given respect. In chapter 11, Tacitus describes a form of folk assembly rather similar to the public Things recorded in later Germanic sources: in these public deliberations, the final decision rests with the men of the group as a whole.
Tacitus further discusses the role of women in chapters 7 and 8, mentioning that they often accompany the men to battle and offer encouragement. He says that the men are often motivated to fight for the women because of an extreme fear of losing them to captivity. Tacitus says (chapter 18) that the Germanic peoples are mainly content with one wife, except for a few political marriages, and specifically and explicitly compares this practice favorably to other cultures. He also records (chapter 19) that adultery is very rare, and that an adulterous woman is shunned afterward by the community regardless of her beauty. In chapter 45, Tacitus mentions that the people to the north of the Germanic peoples, the Sitones, "resemble [the Suevi Scandinavians] in all respects but one - woman is the ruling
sex."[2] "This," Tacitus comments, "is the measure of their decline, I will not say below freedom, but even below decent slavery." "Tacitus - Germania". www.unrv.com
