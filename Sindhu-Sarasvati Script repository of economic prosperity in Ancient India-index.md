Sarasvati Script
S. Kalyanaraman, March 2017
Abstract
The suggested decipherment framework covers both the Script and Itihāsa of Bhāratam Janam. I submit that deciphered Sarasvati Script constitutes a primary resource (with over 8000 inscriptions) together with Ṛgveda Ṛcas (10,600) to narrate the Economic and Cultural Itihāsa of Bhāratam, identifying the roots of the civilization and identity of Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12). Bhāratam nation contributed to about 32% of Global GDP as of 1 CE (pace Angus Maddison1 using Purchasing Power Parity computations). It is significant that vāk (‘speech’ related to Script) calls herself Rāṣṭrī (RV 10.125). Sarasvati Script is a logo-graphic, logosemantic, visible form of spoken language of Bhāratīya sprachbund (expressed by the French word, parole). Sprachbund is a language union, a group of languages that have common features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact. The underlying language of the Script is mleccha (meluhha). Graphics signify the speech forms of words composed as inscriptions. Sarasvati Script Corpora are inscriptions documenting metalwork by artisan guilds. The challenge of historians is to trace the creation of wealth of this Rāṣṭram, nation from ca. 8th millennium BCE. A hypothesis is suggested for further researches that a Maritime Tin Route linked Hanoi and Haifa (between the largest tin belt of the globe in Ancient Far East and Ancient Near East), a trade route which preceded the Silk Road by two millennia.
Prologue defining a decipherment framework
So far, over 8000 inscriptions have been recorded in Sarasvati Script Corpora.
Semantics of plain texts are derived from rebus renderings of ‘sounds of’ cipher-texts or words or graphic compositions. Such compositions are hypertexts with combined or multiple graphics. For example, the mostfrequently used ‘rim-of’jar’ as a hieroglyph graphic in Sarasvati Script
1 Maddison, Angus (6 December 2007). Contours of the world economy, 1–2030 AD: essays in macro-economic history. Oxford University Press. p. 379.

Corpora signifies karṇaka कणर्क , kan-kha ‘a prominence or handle or projection on the side or sides (of a vessel)’ (ŚBr.Santali) Daimabad seal.
Rebus renderings are karṇika कणर्क ‘steersman, helmsman’ or kāraṇīka
कारर्ीक ‘supercargo, a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale.’
(Note 1. The semantics ‘brow of a hill’point to the possibility that another hieroglyph graphic ‘hill-range’ – allograph + ficus
religiosa leaf [Seal Kalibangan063] --may also signify the same word kan-kha + loa ‘ficus’ rebus: loh ‘copper’, creating the plain text message or expression loh kankha ‘copper supercargo’.) Pronunciation variants in spoken forms are evident in thousands of lexemes of ancient languages of Bhāratam. In ancient texts of Bhārata, such pronunciation variants are characterized as mleccha speech, called in another pronunciation variant -- meluhha in cuneiform texts. Hence, the underlying language of Sarasvati Script is Meluhha, or parole of Bhāratīya sprachbund (language union). It is significant that Vātsyāyana refers to ‘mlecchita vikalpa’ in Vidyāsamuddeśa which is described as ‘cipher
writing’ and lits it as one of the 64 arts and sciences (including disciplines such as deśabhāā jñānam, ‘knowledge of dialects’, akṣara muṣṭika kathanam, ‘narration through mudra-s’) taught to the youth.
Considering that visual images are highly graphic representations of the Script, select thumbnails of inscriptions of Sarasvati Script Corpora are embedded, images or art forms of graphics. To these samples should be added the inscriptions with Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs/hypertexts found along sites on the Persian Gulf (about 2000) and in Ancient Near East (Susa, Shahdad, Ur, Tello (Girsu), Gonur, Mari, Haifa, Kultepe etc.) (about 1000).

About 80% of the 2600+ archaeological sites1 of Sarasvati Civilization are located on the Vedic Sarasvati River Basin. In Bhāratīya tradition, for ready reference and to avoid elaborate descriptions.
Sarasvati is also called vāk, ‘speech’. Hence, what is generally referred to as ‘Indus Script’ is renamed as Sarasvati Script. The objective of decipherment of Sarasvati Script is thus to render hieroglyphs/hypertexts as vāk, ‘speech forms’. वाक्य --पदीय [p= 936,2] of भतणर् -हरर is divided into ह्मब्र -काण्ड or आगम-समुच्चय , वाक्य -काण्ड , पद-काण्ड or प्रकीणर्क ‘miscellany’. On a comparable framework, the ‘meanings’ of
combinations of hieroglyphs or hypertexts have to be derived by composing – in language traditions of Bhāratīya sprachbund vākyārtha ‘meanings of word compositions as sentences’. With this step, messages intended to be communicated -- using Sarasvati Script inscriptions as cipher-texts -- can be expressed in plain texts consistent with the Bronze Age life-activities of Bhāratam Janam.
Background, methodology, decipherment and significance

Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa details the activities of round-the-year, 360-day, 36 ten-day cycles of aśvamedha yajña performance which include itihāsa narratives such as: Nârâsamsî Gâthâs and ākhyāna. The narratives are sourced from Veda and Purāṇa.
Topics covered by these itihāsa are outlined in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.6.8, 13.4.3.12 and 13.4.3.13.
These narratives are commented upon in an ancient text: Itihâsam is a darśana. Itihâsa (cosmogonic account) and Purâna (ancient legend), according to SBr. 11.5.6.8, are traditional narratives and
the Narāśaṁsa Gathas are precepts, sciences, dialogues offerings, are honey-offerings to the divinities and Fathers, ancestors. 'Itihâsam âkakshîta, itihâsavedasya prithagbhâvena darsanât,' comm. on Sâṅkh. S.

Itihâsa (cosmogonic account) and Purâna (ancient legend), according to SBr. 11.5.6.8, are traditional narratives and the Narāśaṁsa Gathas are precepts, sciences, dialogues offerings, are honey-offerings to the divinities and Fathers, ancestors.

Aśvamedha, is an ancient, recurrent, cyclical mission of sovereignty, wealth creation/acquisition, reiteration of a dharma social order.
The expression aśvamedha yajña is a metaphor for the reiteration of the sovereignty of the state. This is clarified in the detailed account of the narratives presented on each-day of the ten-day cycle (36 such ten-day cycles are held in a year) of Rajarshi, the philosopher-kings' valour, the battles they fought and won in ancient times. It is a declaration of undisputed sovereignty. A horse accompanied by the king's warriors is released to wander for a period of one year. In the territory traversed by the horse, any rival could dispute the king's authority by challenging the



5
warriors accompanying it.
The narration of itihāsa by Adhvaryu is called pariplava 'revolving, recurrent, or cyclic legend,' so called because it is renewed every ten days during the year.
The coverage in itihāsa pariplava narrative in Aśvamedha is comprehensive: "he (adhvaryu) tells of all royalties, all regions, all Vedas, all gods, all beings..."
अध्वयुण [p= 24,1] m. one who institutes an अध्वर any officiating priest a
priest of a particular class (as distinguished from the होतर् , the उद्गातर् , and
the ह्मब्रन् classes. The अध्वयुण priests " had to measure the ground , to build
the altar , to prepare the sacrificial vessels , to fetch wood and water , to light the fire , to bring the animal and immolate it " ; whilst engaged in
these duties , they had to repeat the hymns of the यजुर् -वेद , hence that वेद
itself is also called अध्वयुण ). Adhvara is a Soma yajña.
Seating arrangements: Yajamana sits on a gold stool on the right of Hotr.
Next to him sit Brahman and Udgatr priests on cushions of gold. In front of these three people, Adhvaryu sits on a slab of gold.
Masters of the lute players sing and play their musical instruments before
each legend starts with prakrama oblations done by the Adhvaryu. Each legend refers to an ancestor ruler, so that the lute players 'share the same world with the righteous kings of yore.'
Each lute player sings three stanzas composed by himself related to the topic selected for each day. There are 3 topics for each stanza: for e.g., Prithu, Bharata, Bhagîratha, Yudhishthira &c. The topic covers how the battle was waged and won: "i.e. surrounded by heroic warriors, fighting on
elephants, steeds, chariots, and on foot, with bows and arrows, spears, swords, &c.) didst thou battle, thus didst thou fight such and such battle (i.e. like Yudhishthira, Dushyanta, &c., having engaged in a battle attended by thousands of great heroes, thou, armed only with thy sharp



6
sword, didst slay the king of Kashmir, Magadha, Pundra, &c., comm.)."
Itihâsam is a darśana
Itihâsa (cosmogonic account) and Purâna (ancient legend), according to SBr. 11.5.6.8, are traditional narratives and the Narāśaṁsa Gathas are precepts, sciences, dialogues offerings, are honey-offerings to the divinities and Fathers, ancestors. 'Itihâsam âkakshîta, itihâsavedasya prithagbhâvena darsanât,' comm. on Sâṅkh. S.
ŚBr. 11.5.6.8 (page 98) http://sacredtexts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44030.htm
ŚBr. 11.5.6.8. And, verily, the precepts 1, the sciences 2, the dialogue 3, the traditional myths and legends 4, and the Nârâsamsî Gâthâs 5 are honey-offerings to the gods; and whosoever, knowing this, studies day by day the precepts, the sciences, the dialogue, the traditional myths and legends, and the Nârâsamsî Gâthâs, for his lesson, satisfies the gods with honey-offerings; and, being satisfied, they satisfy him by (granting him) security of possession, by life-breath, by seed, by his whole self, and by all auspicious blessings; and rivers of ghee and rivers of honey flow for his Fathers, as their accustomed draughts.
98:1 The Anusâsanâni, according to Sâyana, are the six Vedâṅgas, or rules of grammar, etymology, &c.
98:2 By vidyâh, according to Sâyana, the philosophical systems, Nyâya, Mîmâmsa, &c., are to be understood. More likely, however, such special sciences as the 'sarpavidyâ' (science of snakes) are referred to; cf. XIII, 4, 3, 9 seqq.
98:3 Vâkovâkyam, apparently some special theological discourse, or discourses, similar to (if not identical with) the numerous Brahmodya, or disputations on spiritual matters. As an example of such a dialogue, Sâyana refers to the dialogue between Uddâlaka Âruni and Svaidâyana Gautama, XI, 4, 1, 4 seqq.
98:4 Itihâsa-purâna: the Itihâsa, according to Sâyana, are cosmological myths or accounts, such as 'In the beginning this universe was nothing but water,' &c.; whilst as an instance of the Purâna (stories of olden times,



7
purâtanapurushavrittânta) he refers to the story of Purûravas and Urvasî. Cf. Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 40.
98:5 Or, the Gâthâs and Nârâsamsîs. Sâyana, in the first place, takes the two as one, meaning 'stanzas (or verses) telling about men;' but he then refers to the interpretation by others, according to which the Gâthâs are such verses as that about 'the great snake driven from the lake' (XI, 5, 5, 8); whilst the Nârâsamsîs would be (verses 'telling about men') such as that regarding Ganamegaya and his horses (XI, 5, 5, 12). On Aitareyâr. II, 3, 6, 8, Sâyana quotes 'prâtah prâtar anritam to vadanti' as an instance of a Gâthâ.

On ākhyāna
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa ŚBr.13.4.3.12 and 13.4.3.13 (p.368 to p.370 http://sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44104.htm ) explain how on the 8th and 9th days of aśvamedha, stories from Purāṇa and Veda are narrated as itihāsa, ‘history’. The same practice of narration continues on 36 ten
day periods of yajña.

Section 1. Pre-Sanskrit civilization of Meluhha speakers. Sarasvati Script is hieroglyphic in nature and decipherment can be attempted the way Egyptian hieroglyphs were decrypted
Hieroglyphic nature of the writing system rendered rebus in Meluhha speech forms, is demonstrated by a Mohenjo-daro seal with Sarasvati Script. Mohenjodaro m290 is the seal of a metals turner from Mohenjodaro showing खर khar, equus hemionus as a hieroglyph in the text of the inscription.
Seal Mohenjodaro m290 Inscription message: smiths' guild, turner, blacksmith, metal implements/stamped coins.
1. Pictorial motif: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' PLUS pattar 'trough' rebus: pattar 'goldsmith guild' 2. Text message: Hieroglyphs: खर khar rebus: khār खार् 'blacksmith'
(Kashmiri)+ ṭāṅka ʻleg, thighʼ (Oriya) rebus: ṭaṅka टङ्क [p= 429,2]
mn. ( L. ) a spade , hoe , hatchet , stone-cutter's chisel Hariv. 5009ff. R. ii , 80 , 7 Mr2icch. &c ; stamped coin PLUS khar 'ass, onager' (Kashmiri) PLUS kharedo = a currycomb (Gujarati)



11
The text is thus deciphered as: ṭaṅka 'mint' PLUS khār खार् 'blacksmith' PLUS kharādī ‘turner’ (Gujarati)
A unique artistic tradition of Sarasvati Civilization evidenced in sculptures and in hieroglyphs of the Sarasvati Script is the expression of multiple metaphors (which can be called hypertext image representations).
Some examples of hypertexts explain the Sarasvati Script cipher.
For example, heads of an antelope or a one-horned bull are joined to the body of a bovine to create a hypertext and signify a cargo of metalwork.

On the salient features of Sarasvati (Indus) Script, some remarkable observations – of relevance to decipherment researches -- were made by John Hubert Marshall, who was Director-General of Archaeological Survey of India from 1902 to 1908 and associated with excavations of two major sites: Mohejo-daro and Harappa. That he made these observations based on the then available corpus of 541 seal impressions should be
underscored. “The proper names and names of professions on these seals do not supply sufficient material for successful decipherment. It is not possible to separate word and sign groups; the declensions and verb



14
inflections cannot be detected here, and the pronouns are entirely absent. Until longer inscriptions of a literary and historical character are discovered, not much advance in the interpretation can be expected. A good many important facts can be determined, however, to clear the ground for satisfactory research. In the first place this script is in noway even remotely connected with either the Sumerian or Proto-Elamitic
signs...The Indus inscriptions resemble the Egyptian hieroglyphs far more than they do the Sumerian linear and cuneiform system. And secondly, the presence of detached accents in the Indus Script is a feature which distinguishes it from any of these systems. Although vowels must be inherent in all the signs, nevertheless some of the signs and accents must be pure vowel signs. For this reason alone it is necessary to resign further investigation to Sanskrit scholars. If future discoveries make it possible to transliterate the signs, and the language proves to be agglutinative, it will then be a problem for Sumerolotists...I am convinced that all attempts to derive the Brahmi alphabet from Semitic alphabets were complete
failures...This study of the script of a pre-Sanskrit civilization of the Indus Valley is made from the material supplied by 541 impressions of small press seals.” (Marshall, J.H., 1931, Mohenjo-daro and the Indus
Civilization, Repr. Asian Educational Services, 1931, Vol. I, Delhi, pp. 423-424)
These observations provide the framework for the decipherment attempted by this researcher who started the investigations by delineating the courses of a ‘Pre-Sanskrit’ Vedic River called River Sarasvati in North-western Bharata. Since the days of Marshall’s archaeological work of 1920’s,
remarkable progress has been made by the explorations identifying over 2000 archaeological sites (or 80% out of a total of over 2600) on the Sarasvati River Basin. These explorations and limited excavations in about twenty sites have now taken the Sarasvati Script Corpora to a substantial size of over 8000 inscriptions making them fit for cryptographic analyses or cryptanalyses. The Corpora constitute a quantum leap from 541 seal impressions studied by Marshall.
Corpora of Sarasvati Script inscriptions
Based on numerous resources and from the collections of inscribed objects held in many museums of the world, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Sarasvati Writing Corpora include Sarasvati heiroglyphs, representing many facets of glyptic art of Sarasvati Civilization. The corporas also transcribes many texts of inscriptions, corresponding to the



15
epigraphs inscribed on objects. The compilation is based mostly on published photographs in archaeological reports right from the days of Alexander Cunningham who discovered a seal at Harappa in 1875, of Langdon at Mohenjodaro (1931) and of Madhu Swarup Vats at Harappa (1940). The corpus includes objects collected in Bharata, Pakistan, other countries and the finds of the excavations at Harappa by Kenoyer and Meadow during the seasons 1994-1995 and 1999-2000.
Parpola’s initial corpus (CISI 1973) included a total number of 3204 texts. After compiling the pictorial corpus, Parpola notes that there are approximately 3700 legible inscriptions (including 1400 duplicate inscriptions, i.e. with repeated texts). Both the concordances of Parpola and Mahadevan complement each other because of the sort sequence
adopted. Parpola’s concordance is sorted according to the sign following the indexed sign. Mahadevan’s concordance is sorted according to the sign preceding the indexed sign. The latter sort ordering helps in delineating signs which occur in final position.
Two subsequent volumes of the pictorial corpus include a total of inscriptions as collections from Bharata and Pakistan (e.g., Harappa 2590, Mohenjo-daro 2129, Lothal 281, Chanhudaro 50). Additional inscriptions have been discovered which are not included in the three volumes of Corpus of Inscriptions of Parpola et al.: e.g. Khirsara, Farmana, Gilund, Bhirrana, Kunal, Garo Biro, Rakhigarhi). Mahadevan concordance (1977) with only 2906 artifacts, excludes inscribed objects which do not contain ‘texts; for example, this concordance excludes about 50 seals inscribed with the ‘svastikā’ pictorial motif and a pectoral which contains the
pictorial motif of a one-horned bull with a device in front and an overflowing pot. Parpola concordance has been used to present such objects which also contain valuable orthographic data which may assist in decoding the inscriptions. Many broken objects are also contained in Parpola concordance which are useful, in many cases, to count the number of objects with specific ‘field symbolś, a count which also provides some valuable clues to support the decoding of the messages conveyed by the ‘field symbolś which dominate the object space. Along the Persian Gulf, in sites such as Failaka, Bahrain, Saar, nearly 2000 Sarasvati Script inscriptions (so-called Dilmun or Persian Gulf seals) have been found on seals and sealings. These are in addition to the Gadd seals of Ancient Near East (Gadd, CJ, Seals of Ancient Bharata Style found in Ur in: Possehl, GL, ed. 1979, Ancient Cities of the Indus, Delhi, Vikas Publishing House, p.119). In many sites of Ancient Near East such as Shahdad, Susa (lady

spinner artifact with Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs, pot containing metal implements with Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs of fish, quail, flowing water), Tepe Hissar, Haifa (three tin ingots with Sarasvati Script found in a shipwreck), Anau, Altyn Depe (also spelt as Altin Tepe), caravan routes from Ashur and Mari to Kish, Anatolia. Many cylinder seals with cuneiform inscriptions also contain uniquely characteristic Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs such as ‘overflowing pot’, sun’s rays, safflower, pine-cone, fish, scorpion, zebu, buffalo, hair-styles with six curls.
With the publication of CISI Vol. 3, Part 1, the total number of inscriptions from Mohenjo-daro totals 2134 and from Harappa totals 2589; thus, these two sites alone account for 4,723; bring the overall total number of inscriptions to over 6,000 from all sites (even after excluding
comparable inscriptions on ‘Persian Gulf type’ circular seals from the total count).
Meluhha-MaganDilmun=Mesopotamia2
Sarasvati Script is a corpus of symbols constituting a logo-phonetic writing system which was used in Harappa (also known as Sarasvati-Sindhu) Civilization, during the Bronze Age from ca. 3300 BCE 1 to 600 BCE1 in the doab of Vedic Rivers Sarasvati and Sindhu. The people and their language was called Meluhha in ancient cuneiform texts. Sarasvati Script inscriptions occur also in the Persian Gulf (also called Magan and Dilmun in ancient cuneiform texts), in contact areas of Mesopotamia (Ancient Near East) and in Dong Son/Karen Bronze Drums Culture areas of the Ancient Far East (L'Extrême-Orient pace George Coedes3)
Researches have also progressed in delineating the ‘Pre-Sanskrit’ language bases of the civilization. The received wisdom of 1920’s of the framework of languages such as Sanskrit, Egyptian (Coptic), Sumerian, Elamite, Greek, Indo-European has been significantly expanded thanks to ProtoIndo-European language researches. “Proto-Indo-Europen (PIE) is the linguistic reconstruction of the common ancestor of the Indo-European



17
languages. Since there is no written record of this language, the knowledge of it that we have has been reconstructed using historical linguistics, by comparing and extrapolating back from the properties fo the languages descended from it. It is thought that Proto-Indo-European may have been spoken as a single language (before divergence began) around 3500 BCE, though estimates vary by more than a thousand years...Today, there are about 445 living Indo-European (IE) languages descended from PIE, with Spanish, English, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Punjabi, German, French and Marathi being the ten Indo-European languages with the most native speakers in descending order. PIE is thought to have had a complex system of morphology that included inflectional suffixes as well as ablaut (vowel alterations, for example, sing, sang, sung). Nouns and verbs had complex systems of declension and conjugation respectively... In 1816 Franz Bopp published On the System of Conjugation in Sanskrit in which he investigated a common origin of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German. In 1833 he began publishing the Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavic, Gothic,and German...JuliusPokorny's Indogermanisches
etymologisches Wörterbuch ("Indo-European Etymological Dictionary", 1959) gave a detailed, though conservative, overview of the lexical knowledge accumulated up until that time. ” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language ‘The original speakers may have originated in the Pontic-Caspian steppe of Eastern Europe north of the Black Sea’ or from the Ganga River Basin or
Mekong-Irrawaddy-Salween River deltas in the Ancient Far East (with evidence of Austro-Asiatic or Proto-Munda languages). A major resource has been compiled called the Indian Lexicon with over 8000 semantic clusters from over 25 Ancient Languages of Bharata.

Adapted from R. Bouckaert et al, Science, 2012. More than 400 IndoEuropean languages diverged from a common ancestral tongue; the
earliest ones (top right), Anatolian and Tocharian, arose in today’s Turkey and China, respectively. http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/mysterious-indo-europeanhomeland-may-have-been-steppes-ukraine-andrussia?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=face book
Georges Pinault pointed to the concordance between Vedic and Tocharian: amśu ~~ ancu, 'iron' (Tocharian). Amśu (Vedic Sanskrit or Chandas) is a synonym for Soma. This concordance makes Soma a metaphor for metal of th Bronze Age. See Harosheth hagoyim – Smithy of nations.

commander of the army of ‘Jabin, king of Canaan’. Harosheth hagoyim ‘smithy of nations’ is cognate with kharoṣṭī खरोष्टी A kind of alphabet; Lv.1.29 PLUS gōya (Prākṛt) ‘gotra or guild or lineage’. These two anecdotal evidences point to the Sarasvati Script inscriptions as repositories of metalwork catalogues. Sarasvati Writing in Ancient Near East is a tribute to the Meluhha artisans who have established an expansive contact area in Eurasia and left for posterity the bronze-age

discovery of a knowledge system detailing contributions of Bharata artisans to the Bronze Age Revolution, traceable to ancient times of 5th millennium BCE.
It is interesting that Dr. Moti Shemtov refers to Nahal Mishmar as Nachal Mishmar. It is similar to the identification of Meluhha and Mleccha, as cognates ! – both terms derivable from mliṣṭa म्लिष्ट [p= 837,3] mfn. spoken indistinctly or barbarously Pāṇ. 7-2 , 18, indistinct speech.
The hypothesis of this monograph is premised on the definition of
mleccha (meluhha) as the spoken forms of ‘Pre-Sanskrit’ or ‘Proto-IndoEuropean’ (PIE). Borrowings have occurred among Dravidian, Munda and
IE language-families since the present-day consensus among linguists is that Bharata was a sprachbund (language union or linguistic area) of the Bronze Age, since many language speakers absorbed language features from one another and made them their own.
Variants of hieroglyph ‘rim of jar’ in Sarasvati Script. This characteristic feature of Bharata sprachbund explains the sheer variety of phonetic
speech forms as exemplified by the example of Santali word, kankha ‘rim of jar’, a hieroglyph which is of the most frequent occurrence in Sarasvati Script corpora.
The cognates of this word and concomitant semantic expansions of the Pre-Sanskrit forms such as kankha (Austro-Asiatic), kaṉṉam (Tamil) can be seen in the vocables of Indo-Aryan languages: kárṇaka m. ʻ projection

Mleccha, as cognate of Meluhha speech is attested in Mahabharata, Jatugrihaparva which records that conversation took place between Yudhishthira and Khanaka in



21
‘mleccha’ tongue. It is hypothesized that Mleccha aka Meluhha was the vernacular, spoken version of what John Maynard Marshall refers to as ‘Pre-Sanskrit civilization’.
The Mekong-Irrawaddy-Salween River deltas formed by the three Himalayan glacial rivers are crucial to an understanding of the Bronze Age civilizations, because these deltas are coterminous with the largest Tin Belt of the globe. Tin was a crucial mineral to substitute for the scarcity of naturally occurring arsenical bronzes. Tin or cassiterite mineral added to copper mineral yielded Tin-Bronze which created the Bronze Age revolution, from ca. 5th millennium BCE.
Let us continue to use Marshall’s expression, ‘Pre-Sanskrit’ civilization, but call it populated by Meluhha speakers, a hypothesis to be tested by further researches. This is suggested because this particular language Meluhha is attested by a seal with cuneiform text which refers to the translator of the Meluhha language. The cuneiform text reads in Akkadian: ShuIlishu EME.BAL.ME.LUH.HA.KI (i.e., interpreter of Meluhha language). Roll out of Mesopotamian Cylinder seal of Shu-Ilishu. Late Akkadian ca. 2200-2113 BCE.

Hieroglyphic nature of Sarasvati (Indus) Script writing system justifies the use of rebus method to decipher and read out the plain text Meluhha inscriptions.
Examples of inscriptions reviewed are:
• Water carrier as a hieroglyph • Scorpion as a hieroglyph • Human face as a hieroglyph • Feeding trough as a hieroglyph
A classic paper by Cyril John Gadd F.B.A. who was a Professor Emeritus of Ancient Semitic Languages and Civilizations, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, opened up a new series of archaeological studies related to the trade contacts between Ancient Far East and what is now called Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization.
The paper was published in the Proceedings of the British Academy, XVIII, 1932.
Gadd presents examples of seals from Ur and considers them 'Indian style'. Two such examples were that Seal impression No. 12 (Watercarrier) and Seal No.11 (Scorpion and Ellipse) which are presented in this monograph.
GR Hunter commented on Gadd's insight in Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, 1932 pointing out that the enclosure of the pictorial moif (of water-carrier PLUS two stars on either side of the head) by 'parenthesis' marks is perhaps a way of splitting of the ellipse and that this is an unmistakable example of an 'hieroglyph' seal.
Water carrier as a hieroglyph



23
Seal impression. Ur. C.J. Gadd, Seals of ancient Indian style found at Ur, Proceedings of the British Academy, XVIII, 1932, pp. 11-12, Plate II, No. 12; Description: water carrier with a skin (or pot?) hung on each end of the yoke across his shoulders and another one below the crook of his left arm; the vessel on the right end of his yoke is over a receptacle for the water; a star on either side of the head (denoting supernatural?). The whole object is enclosed by 'parenthesis' marks. The parenthesis is perhaps a way of splitting of the ellipse (Hunter, G.R., JRAS, 1932, 476). An unmistakable example of an 'hieroglyphic' seal.
In the context of the water-carrier hieroglyph PLUS stars enclosed within parenthesis, CJ Gadd had rightly noted that these are determinatives that the writing system was hieroglyphic.
kuṭi ‘water-carrier’ (Telugu) rebus: kuṭhi ‘smelter’ kuṛī f. ‘fireplace’ (H.); krvṛi f. ‘granary (WPah.); kuṛī, kuṛo house, building’(Ku.)(CDIAL 3232) kuṭi ‘hut made of boughs’
(Skt.) guḍi temple (Telugu) meḍha ‘polar star’ rebus: mẽṛhẽt,
meḍ ‘iron’ (Santali.Mu.Ho.) dula ‘pair’ rebus: dul ‘metal casting’.
The most frequently occurring glyph -- rim of jar -- ligatured to Glyph 12 becomes Glyph 15 and is thus explained as a kanka,
karṇaka: ‘furnace scribe’ and is consistent with the readings of glyphs which occur together with this glyph. Kan-ka may denote an artisan working with copper, kaṉ (Ta.) kaṉṉār ‘coppersmiths, blacksmiths’ (Ta.) Thus, the phrase kaṇḍ karṇaka may be decoded rebus as a brassworker, scribe. karṇaka, karNIka ‘scribe, accountant’ karNi 'supercargo'
Semantic expansion occurs when this hieroglyph is superscripted with 'rim-of-jar' hieroglyph:



24
Glyph15 variants (Parpola)
Sign 15: kuṭhi kaṇḍa kanka ‘smelting furnace account (scribe)’.
kuTi 'water-carrier' rebus: kuThi 'smelter' kanda 'pot' rebus: kanda 'firealtar' kanka, karanika 'rim of jar' rebus: kāraṇika 'smelter producer'. Thus the hieroglyph-multiplex is an expression: kuThi kāraṇika 'smelter-maker.' kuTi karaṇī 'Supercargo smelter' (i.e. Supercargo responsible for trading produce from smelter and carried by seafaring vessel).
Scorpion as a hieroglyph
Seal; UPenn; a scorpion and an elipse [an eye (?)]; U. 16397; Gadd, PBA 18 (1932), pp. 1011, pl. II, no. 11 Rectangular stamp seal of dark steatite; U. 11181; B.IM. 7854; ht. 1.4, width 1.1 cm.; Woolley, Ur Excavations, IV (1956), p. 50, n.3.
bicha, 'scorpion' rebus: bica 'haematite, ferrite ore'.
Hieroglyph: oval shaped bun ingot: mũhe 'ingot' (Santali) mũhã̄ = the quantity of iron produced from a furnace (Santali). Thus, the two hieroglyphs signify haematite ore ingot.
Since the insights of Gadd and Hunter in 1932, the Sarasvati Script Corpora has grown to include over 7000 inscriptions.
Hieroglyphic nature of the Sarasvati (Indus) Script writing system may also be seen in the following examples.
Human face as a hieroglyph

[The 'cross' or X hieroglyph is incised on all three tin ingots found in a shipweck in Haifa.]

The inscription on the tablet juxtaposes – through the hand gestures of a person - a ‘trough’ gestured with the right hand; a ligatured glyph composed of ‘rim-of-jar’ glyph and ‘water-carrier’ glyph (Sign 15) gestured with the left hand.
A characteristic feature of Indus writing system unravels from this example: what is orthographically constructed as a pictorial motif can also be deployed as a 'sign' on texts of inscriptions. This is achieved by a stylized reconstruction of the pictorial motif as a 'sign' which occurs with notable frequency on Indus Script Corpora -- with orthographic variants (Signs 12, 13, 14).

The Pali expression usu -- kāraṇika -- m. ʻ arrow -- maker ʼ provides the semantics of the word kāraṇika as relatable to a 'maker' of a product. usukāraṇika is an arrow-maker. Thus, kuTi kāraṇika can be explained as a
smelter-maker. Supercargo is a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale. The Marathi word for Supercargo is: kārṇī. Thus, it can be suggested that kuTi kāraṇika was an ovrseer of the cargo (from smelter) on a merchantship. In the historical periods, the Supercargo has specific duties "The duties of a supercargo are defined by admiralty law and include managing the cargo owner's trade, selling the merchandise inports to which the vessel is sailing, and buying and receiving goods to be carried on the return voyage...A new supercargo was always appointed for each journey who also had to keep books, notes and ledgers about everything that happened during the voyage and trade matters abroad. He was to present these immediately to the directors of the Company on the ship's return to its headquarters." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercargo While a captain was in charge of navigation, Supercargo was in charge of trade. कारण 1[p= 274,2] a number of scribes or कायस्थ s W. instrument , means;that on which an opinion or judgment is founded (a sin, mark; a proof; a legal instrument, document), Mn.

T rough PLUS buffalo/bull Other examples of trough as a hieroglyph on Indus writing seals shown in front of animals.



34
A trough is shown in front of some domesticated animals and also wild animals like rhinoceros, tiger, elephant. The trough glyph is clearly a hieroglyph, in fact, a category classifier. Trough as a glyph occurs on about one hundred inscriptions, though not identified as a distinct pictorial motif in the corpus of inscriptions. Why is a trough shown in front of a rhinoceros which was not a domesticated animal? A reasonable deduction is that ‘trough’ is a hieroglyph intended to classify the animal ‘rhinoceros’ in a category.

Section 2. Preparation for the decipherment attempt



38
Preparation for the decipherment effort is in two parallel stages: Stage 1. Compilation of the Sarasvati Script Corpora; and Stage 2. Compilation of the Bharata sprachbund lexicon called Indian Lexicon.as a comparative dictionary for over 25 ancient languages of Bharata in semantic clusters to reconstruct the phonetic forms of the language spoken by the creators of the Corpora. Since the preliminary indicators point to the Corpora to be metalwork catalogues, these two parallel stages are complemented by the compilation of data archives related to archaeo-metallurgy in respect of 1. Metal alloys and 2. Cire Perdue (lost-wax) techniques of metalcastings. A tribute has to be paid to many savants who have researched into Sarasvati Script ever since 1875 when Alexander Cunningham published a surface find of Harappa seal with Sarasvati Script. Many concordance lists have been compiled. Many inscriptions are not restricted to the River Basins of Rivers Sarasvati and Sindhu (Indus) but extend over an expansive contact area which stretches from Hanoi (Vietnam, e.g. Dong Son Bronze Drum) to Haifa (Israel, three pure tin ingots with Sarasvati Script).



39
Mari in relation to Persian Gulf. The concordance lists constitute the Sarasvati Script Corpora which now number more than 8000, thanks to the discoveries of Persian Gulf or Dilmun seals and also artifacts such as the sculptural frieze of Spinner lady with Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs, now in Louvre Museum or Standard of Mari held in a procession. The standard upheld by the central figure is itself an emphatic hieroglyph because the post which holds the standard of ‘one-horned young bull’ a very frequently used hypertext in Sarasvati Script Corpora, is neither a stick nor rod, but ‘culm of
millet’. karb ‘culm of millet’ rebus: karba ‘iron’. kaḍambá, kalamba - 1, m. ʻ end, point, stalk of a potherb ʼ lex. [See kadambá -- ] B. kaṛamba ʻ stalk of greens ʼ;

Section 3. Methodology developed
There are enormous documented resources available from ancient texts of Bharata for trying out various methods. This resource relates to the method of documenting a research and is called tantra yukti. This method of research documentation in over 32 categories. The method is also called, in the context of mathematical and astronomical researches as Yuktibhāṣā (Malayalam: യുക്തിഭാഷ ; "Rationale in the Malayalam/Sanskrit language"[(K V Sarma; S Hariharan (1991). "Yuktibhāṣā of Jyeṣṭhadeva: A book on rationales in Indian Mathematics and Astronomy: An analytic appraisal" in: Indian Journal of History of Science. 26 (2), pp. 185-207.)

Yukti or rationale is evaluated in terms of the meanings and many categories such as 32 devices listed in Arthaśāstra:
अर्िकरर् (topic), र्विानों (statement of contents), योगः (employment of
sentences),पदाथणः (meaning of the word), हेत्वथणः (reason), उेद्दशः (mention),
र्नदेशः (explanation), उपदेशः (advice), अपदेशः (reference),अर्देशः
(application), प्रदेशः (indication), उपमानों (analogy), अथाणपर्ि (implication),
सोंशयः (doubt), प्रसोंगः (situation), र्वपयणयः (contrary), वाक्यशेषः (completion
of a sentence), अनुमोंर् (agreement), व्याख्यानों (emphasis), र्नवणचनों
(derivation), र्नदशणनों (illustration),अपवगण (exception), स्वसोंज्ञा (technical

अर्क्क्रों िार्वेिोंर् (reference to a past statement), र्नयोगः (restriction),
र्वकल्प (option, alternative), समुच्चय (combination), ऊोंह्य (what is understood). (Kautilya Arthaśāstra, Vol. II, 1972, Delhi, MLBD).

Tantra is synonymously used with äyurveda, a branch of Veda, education, aphorism,
knowledge, śāstra and definition. (Carakasamhitä, siddhisthänam,
uttaravastisiddhih ,12 adhyäyaù, s’lokaù 29, 30 païcamakhANDah, Edited and Revised by Kaviraja Narendranath Sengupta, Kaviraja Balaichandra Sengupta, Caukhambä Orientalia Varanasi–1, 1991 (Reprinted) https://www.academia.edu/12132105/Tantrayukti
समुच्चय (combination) method is apparent from the orthographic device of
combining animal parts to साोंगडेंर् (p. 495) sāṅgaḍaṇēṃ v c
(sangada), that is, ‘To link, join, or unite together (boats, fruits, animals).’ Similar combination occurs on other hieroglyphs, the so-called signs, using the ‘ligatures’, for e.g. by infixing short linear strokes within ‘rim of jar’ or by ligaturing the ‘water
carrier’ hieroglyph with a ‘rim of jar’. साोंगड (p. 495) sāṅgaḍa is thus ‘f A body formed of two or more (fruits, animals, men) linked or joined together.’ It is also a lathe or a joined canoe



44
called ‘catamaran’, साोंगड (p. 495) sāṅgaḍa m f (सोंघट्ट S) A float composed of two canoes or boats bound together.
Such a समुच्चय (combination) method is referred to as ‘hypertexting’ in modern computer jargon to signify cross-referencing between sections of text and associated graphic material.
Sarasvati Script inscriptions are very short. The average number of ‘text signs’ is 5 with or without pictorial motifs or field symbols on seals and tablets. The short texts and the 400+ symbols on ‘sign list’ are pointers to the logo-phonetic nature of the Script. These ‘signs’ are NOT pictograms but logograms because they represent words in Harappa language. Unfortunately, many attempts at decipherment were premised on a conjecture of alphabetical or syllabic nature of the Script and searching for ‘names or titles or sentences composed of morphemes and grammatical units such as prepositions’ on the assumption that the seals and tablets should have recorded names or titles or even poems of prayer. Such assumptions ignored the essentially pictorial nature of the Script
composed of hieroglyphs both as ‘text signs’ and as ‘pictorial motifś and pictorial narratives such as a tiger looking back and a person sitting on a tree branch. An approach frameḍ on the hypothesis that Sarasvati Script was necessitated for trade transactions to cope with the Bronze Age Revolution, provides a framework for the use of rebus method evidenced on Egyptian hieroglyphs which are rebus renderings of consonants in words (See discussions on rebus readings of hieroglyphs which are complete messages on Narmer palette and on Ivory tags with one to four hieroglyphs, from U-J of Abydos tomb dated to ca. 32nd cent. BCE). Thus, it will be a futile and speculative exercise to look for long texts in Sarasvati Script which has achieved comprehensive messaging to render utterances in Harappa language, using rebus principle to compose hypertexts in Meluhha cipher (pairs of homonymous words, one set signifying logograms and another set signifying similar sounding metalwork catalogue items).



45
The hypertext principle of Sarasvati Script is demonstrated effectively by Dennys Frenez and Massimo Vidale4 for Sarasvati Script, identifying pictorial components which constitute a composite orthographic construction as in the example of a composite animal orthographed by various parts of various animals on m0300 Mohenjo-daro seal. Orthographic components are identified and explained by Dennys Frenez and Massimo Vidale.
The evidence is remarkable that many single glyphs or glyptic elements of the Sarasvati Writing can be read rebus using the repertoire of artisans (lapidaries working with precious shell, ivory, stones and terracotta, mineworkers, stone-masons, metal-smiths working with a variety of minerals, furnaces and other tools) who created the inscribed objects and used many of them to authenticate their trade transactions. Many of the inscribed objects are seen to be calling cards of the professional artisans, listing their professional skills and repertoire. Many are veritable mining- and metalwork catalogs.
Continuing legacies of glyptic art noted by Huntington: “There is a continuity of composite creatures demonstrable in Indic culture since Kot Diji ca. 4000 BCE.”5
The identification of glosses from the present-day languages of Bharata on Sarasvati river basin is justified by the continuation of culture evidenced by many artifacts evidencing civilization continuum from the Vedic Sarasvati River basin, since language and culture are intertwined, resulting in a unique, logo-semantic writing system. .
Over 7000 inscriptions of Sarasvati Script are metalwork documents. Data mining techniques are applied to this Corpora for knowledge discovery
about aspects of the Bronze Age Revolution such a: 1. Cire perdue lostwax technique for creating metal sculptures of exquisite beauty and artistry (e.g. dancing girl bronze statue of Mohenjodaro); and 2. Techniques of alloying of minerals to create hard alloys necessary to forge
useful tools, implements, weapons, pots and pans; 3. Organization of guilds of artisans and merchants as Corporate forms to control the worksin-process (e.g. circular platforms of Harappa) and shipment of cargo of metalwork merchandise using dhows, seafaring vessels.
Tin-Bronze Revolution as a trans-Eurasian phenomenon is attested by archaeological discoveries of artifacts and ancient cuneiform text records,



46
which validate Sarasvati Script inscriptions, datable to ca. 5th-4th millennium BCE.
Sarasvati Script is mlecchita vikalpa cryptography, uses rebus method of substitution cipher
Mlecchita vikalpa is an expression used as the 52nd item in the list of 64 arts learnt by youth (Chapter 3, Part 1, Vatsyayana’s Kamasutra dated to ca. 1st cent. CE). Translators Richard Burton, Bhagavanlal Indrajit, Shivaram Parashuram Bhide explain the expression mlecchita vikalpa as ‘the art of understanding writing in cipher’ or cryptography or, simply, encryption.
Definition of terms
The intended message is plain text and the encrypted vikalpa (alternative representation) is ciphertext. Decrypting the ciphertext using Meluhha (mleccha) language of Bharatiya sprachbund (language union), is decipherment of Sarasvati Script. Mleccha of Meluhha is the reconstructed spoken form characterized by mispronunciations and variant spellings identified from the comparative lexicon of over 25 ancient languages of Bharata (called Indian Lexicon)

civilization. The date of this potsherd compares with the date of bone/ivory tags with Egyptian hieroglyphs discovered in Abydos U-j tomb ca. 3200 BCE. It is remarkable that the writing systems of Egyptian hieroglyphs, cuneiform texts on cylinder seals with pictorial



47
motifs which include Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs were invented ca. 3000 BCE almost simultaneously with the invention of Sarasvati Script ca. 3300 BCE.
Yasodhara’s Jayamangala (13th cent.) is a commentary on Kamasutra and describes that the mlecchita vikalpa method of writing is ‘substitution
cipher’ and that -- as in the methods called Kautiliyam and Muladeviya--, the letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations.
Kautiliyam is a mlecchita named after Kautilya, the author of the ancient Indian political treatise, the Arthaśāstra. In this system, the short and long vowels, the anusvara and the spirants are interchanged for the consonants and the conjuncts. The following table shows the substitutions used in the Kautiliyam cipher. The characters not listed in the table are left unchanged.

Cryptanalysis or breaking of codes and ciphers is the method to decipher Sarasvati Script writing system. Atbash (name derived from first, last, second and second to last Hebrew letters, Aleph-Tav-Beth-Shrin) is a method of monoalphabetic substitution cipher dated to ca. 600 BCE. In this cipher, the modern Hebrew alphabet would be:

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash
The reference to kautiliyam is significant because the text of Kautilya is titled Kauṭilīyaṃ
Arthaśāstram, ‘the science of wealth creation’.
The glyphs of the Sarasvati Script or Sarasvati Writing include both pictorial motifs and signs. Both categories of glyphs are read rebus. As a first step in delineating the Harappa language, an Indian lexicon provides a resource, compiled semantically in clusters of over 1240 groups of words/expressions from ancient Bharata languages as a Proto-Indic substrate dictionary.
Rebus method to signify phonetic sounds of words, is a logo-phonetic writing system
The writing system seems to use the rebus principle to phonetize its hieroglyphs. Such a rebus principle is seen in ca. 3100 BCE Egyptian hieroglyphs of Narmer and Abydos tomb. At Tomb UJ at Abydos in Upper Egypt (dated to ca. 3250 BCE), Dreyer found place names written in Egyptian hieroglyphs (up to four in number) recognizable as hieroglyphs which persisted and were employed during later periods and which are written and read phonetically. The rebus principle may explain the pictorial motifs of some cylinders of Ancient Near East of ca. 3100 BCE.

Dryer notes: “As most of the signs manifest themselves as hieroglyphics in the dynastic period (i.e. after 3170 BCE or so), and since their later arrangement can already be observed in the beginning, it makes sense to take them, at least in part, not simply as symbols/markers, but to read them like hieroglyphics...Also other groups of signs can be read with the same phonetic values...The stork beside the chair (No. 103)...b..st = Basta. The fact that names of
places occur among the signs, can be proven on a non-decipherable (nicht lesbaren) sign, the wrestlers, which are (also) inscribed as a hieroglyphic, identifying a place on the pallet of cities in one of the city-rings. A series of tags with the combination of tree + animal can be read, similarly to inscriptions on vessels, as designations of commodities that are named after their originator...Although it is often difficult to decide whether a sign is an ideogram or a phonogram. In some cases only one definitive interpretation is possible.” (loc.cit. Richard Mattessich, 2002, The oldest writings, and inventory tags of Egypt, A review essay of Gunter Dreyer’s Umm El-Quaab I-Das pradynastische Konigsgrab U-j und seine fruhen Schriftzeugnisse, in: The Accounting Historians Journal 29 (June 2002), pp. 195-208; Contaduria No. 41, Medellin, September 2002). https://aprendeenlinea.udea.edu.co/revistas/index.php/cont/article/viewFile /25609/21149

Clearly, the ivory and bone tags of royal tomb U-j Abydos were inventory tags (‘vouchers’ or ‘inventory labels’) with
some accounting information. Early token and token-envelope accounting systems of Mesopotamia were also precursors of the syllabic cuneiform writing.
The hieroglyphs on inventory tags not merely show but say. Thus a remarkable advance has occurred over pictographic writing as it moved into the phase of logographic writing.
Hieroglyphs: N’r M’r (N’r ‘cuttle fish’ M’r ‘awl’) rebus: Narmer (king’s name of 33rd cent. BCE in Egypt).
“ Linguistic terminology makes it possible to identify the various units of language that helped to transform communication in early Egypt from merely pictorial expression to speech writing, which is important in identifying the nature of early graphic material: "1) Logograms: symbols representing specific words "2) Phonograms: symbols representing specific sounds "3) Determinatives: symbols used for classifying words "Moreover, writing on the tags shows that the Egyptian writing system had adopted the rebus principle, which broadened the meaning of symbols to include their homophones—words with the same sound but different definitions..." (Elise V. Macarthur, "The Concept and Development of the Egyptian Writing System" IN: Woods (ed), Visible Language. Inventions of Writing in the Middle East and Beyond [2010] 120).

Bone/ivory tags measuring 2 by 1 1⁄2 cms. With one to four glyphs, clay seal impressions bearing hieroglyphs were unearthed by Germn Archaeological Institute from the tomb of predynastic ruler Scorpion at Abydos, south of Cairo. These are dated to ca. 3400-3200 BCE and constitute the earliest examples of Egyptian hieroglyph writing. “According to Jim Allen of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, such early hieroglyphs represent a rebus system, akin to modern Japanese, in which pictures are used according to the way they sound. In early phonetic systems phrases such as "I believe," for example, might be rendered with an eye, a bee, and a leaf. The Abydos hieroglyphs are simple precursors to the complex hieroglyphic forms discovered at later sites such as Metjen and Turin.”

Mlecchita vikalpa exemplifies tantra yukti, the Bharatiya method of composing a writing system. Tantra can be termed as that which discusses and details subjects and concepts; yukti is “... that which removes blemishes like impropriety, contradiction, etc., from the intended meaning and thoroughly joins the meanings together.” The expression, Tantrayukti denotes those devices that aid the composition of a text in a
systematic manner to convey intended ideas clearly. Cakrapāṇi lists 40 distinct devices of tantra yukti; 32 or more of these devices are
exemplified in the treatises of Suśruta, Caraka, Vāgbhaṭa, Kautilya, Panini on knowledge domains of Ayurveda, Arthaśāstra and grammar of Samskrtam. Caraka notes:
ोंेत्रर्समासव्यासोेक्त भवेर्न्त्या र्ह रत्स्नशः एकदेशने ेदृश्यन्त समासार्भर्हेर् र्था ‘al l these tantrayukti-s occur in a scientific work in brief and in detail. But only some of them occur in a work written in brief.”
A characteristic feature of the structure and form of Sarasvati Script is crispness of expression. This is governed by the cardinal principle of tantra yukti :
ु स्फटर्ा न पदैरपाकत र्ा न च न स्वीकत र् मथणगौरवम् ‘Crispness (of an
expression) is not obliterated by verbosity, nor is the depth of meaning that is intended to be conveyed compromised (to attain crispness).
Precision of speech expression is achieved by unambiguously orthographed devices of hieroglyphs signified by images of wild and domestic animals (tiger, elephant, rhinoceros, boar, buffalo, zebu, ox,



52
goat, markhor, ram, serpent hood), narratives such as a tiger or an antelope with head turned backwards, an archer or person seated in penance, a worshipper, tumblers, drummer, ficus religiosa leaf, claws of crab, rice-plant sprout, pincers, harrow, comb, scarf, lid of jar, rim of jar, rimless pot, ladle, stool, hayrick, platform, crocodile, frog, turtle, fish, fish-eye, quail, duck or aquatic birds, black ant, svastika, fire-altar, hillock, mountain-range, twig or sprig, numerical markers – one, two, three, four to signify numeral words. Semantic expansion to signify speech expressions is achieved by the ‘crispness’ feature of ligaturing combining animal heads, animal parts, infixed or circumscribed or superscripted hieroglyph multiplexes creating hypertexts. Such hypertexts have been matched with words and expressions of Harappa language (Meluhha) using the lexis of Indian Lexicon. Such words and expressions of animals, etc. hieroglyph-muliplexes have homonyms (rebus, similar sounding words) in the parole(speech forms) of Meluhha (again using the lexis of Indian Lexicon). All the homonyms for words and expressions so discovered relate to metalwork catalogues.
Some typical tantra yukti devices in the narratives of Sarasvati Script Corpora
are: upamānam (or दृष्टान्त dRṣṭānta or analogy), vākyaviśeṣa (completion of a sentence meaningfully even in the absence of a word which is understood), pūrvapakṣa (objections, prima facie or provisional view), uttarapakṣa (correct view or answers). These devices are among 32 devices inArthaiśāstra list of Tantra yukti. Nidarśana (illustration) The illustration of the devices of tantra yukti occurs on a cylinder seal from Ancient Near East. Cylinder Seal of Ibni-Sharrum Agade period, reign of Sharkali-Sharri (c. 2217-2193 BCE) Mesopotamia Serpentine H. 3.9 cm; Diam. 2.6 cm Formerly in the De Clercq collection; gift of H. de Boisgelin, 1967 AO 22303 The

Section 4. Steps of the Decipherment with illustrations
When hieroglyphs or hypertexts are ‘organized’ on an object, for e.g. a seal, there is an integral unity in the message (plain text) intended for



54
communication. The Bogazkoy seal is intended to create a seal impression, say, on a cargo consignment by a metal merchant. All the hieroglyph components of the inscription have to be read together to generate a sentence. In this case, the sentence reads: three mineral ores metal casting.

2.5 inch long Mohenjo-daro gold pendant has a 0.3 inch nib; its ending is shaped like a nib of a stylus pen or sewing or netting needle. It bears an inscription painted (perhaps with ferric oxide pigment) in Sarasvati Script. This inscription is deciphered as a proclamation of metalwork competence.

Sarasvati Script is a mlecchita vikalpa which employs the method of word or expression substitution cipher, i.e. substituting the word or expression signified by a picture with a similar-sounding word or expression (called homonym).
Sarasvati Script uses the method of word substitution cipher which can be called rebus, i.e. substituting the word signifying a hieroglyph with a similar-sounding word to convey the intended meaning, plain message. Thus, original pictorial message in cipher is substituted by the plain message.
For example, the picture of ‘rim of jar’ signifies the expression kanda kankha (variant pronunciation karṇika). This pictorial expression is substituted by a similar-sounding expression to signify the plain text: khāṇḍā 'tools, pots and pans, metal-ware' PLUS karṇī 'supercargo, a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale."; karṇika 'helmsman'. Thus, the picture ‘rim of jar’ signifies rebus: khāṇḍā karṇika '(metal) equipment, (metal) ware helmsman, supercargo, clerk (accountant)'.
loa 'ficus glomerata' rebus: loh 'copper' PLUS
kaṇḍa kankha 'rim of jar' rebus: khāṇḍā karṇī,
karṇika 'metal equipment account scribe, supercargo'.
khōṇḍa m A young bull, a bullcalf rebus: kunda ‘fine gold’.
Thus, the inscription with three hieroglyphs on the seal conveys the inventory of: copper, gold of supercargo, a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale.
The young bull is a hypertext with a number of hieroglyph components: one-horned young bull + rings on neck + pannier

A bullcalf. kodeduda. A young bull (Telugu) (NOTE: the hieroglyph is a hypertext composed of young bull, one horn, pannier (a काों बळा 'sack' of which one end is formed into a cowl or hood), rings on neck.)
The importance of the 'jar' khāṇḍā can be seen from the use of the jar as cargo container, exemplified by the discovery of Susa pots as storage devices. A particular storage pot which contained metal implements from Meluhha is the defining archaeological evidence for the semantics of the 'rim-ofjar': 'metal equipment account scribe, supercargo'. This is a rivetting evidence for the purport of the entire Sarasvati Script corpora of over 8000 inscriptions since the 'rim-of-jar' hieroglyph occurs in about 70% of the inscriptions.
Below the rim of the storage pot, the contents are described in Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs/hypertexts: 1. Flowing water; 2. fish with fin; 3. aquatic bird tied to a rope Rebus readings of these



60
hieroglyphs/hypertexts signify metal implements from the Meluhha mint.

Santali glosses. Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs painted on the jar are: fish, quail and streams of water; aya 'fish' (Munda) rebus: aya 'iron' (Gujarati) ayas 'metal' (Rigveda) khambhaṛā 'fin' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint' Thus, together ayo kammaṭa, 'metals mint'

mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formeḍinto an equilateral lump a little pointed at each end; mẽṛhẽt, meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.) Thus, read together, the proclamation on the jar by the painted hieroglyphs is: baṭa meṛh karaḍā ayas kāṇḍa 'hard alloy iron metal implements out of the furnace (smithy)'.
This is a jar closed with a ducted bowl. The treasure called "vase in hiding" was initially grouped in two containers with lids. The second ceramic vessel was covered with a copper lid. It no longer exists leaving only one. Both pottery contained a variety of small objects form a treasure six seals, which range from Proto-Elamite period (3100-2750 BCE) to the oldest, the most recent being dated to 2450 BCE (First Dynasty of Ur).
Therefore it is possible to date these objects, this treasure. Everything included 29 vessels including 11 banded alabaster, mirror, tools and weapons made of copper and bronze, 5 pellets crucibles copper, 4 rings with three gold and a silver, a small figurine of a frog lapis lazuli, gold beads 9, 13 small stones and glazed shard. "In the third millenium Sumerian texts list copper among the raw materials reaching Uruk from Aratta and all three of the regions Magan, Meluhha and Dilmun are associated with copper, but the latter only as an emporium. Gudea refers obliquely to receiving copper from Dilmun: 'He (Gudea) conferred with the divine Ninzaga (= Enzak of Dilmun), who transported copper like grain deliveries to the temple builder Gudea...' (Cylinder A: XV, 11-18, Englund 1983, 88, n.6). Magan was certainly a land producing the metal, since it is occasionally referred to as the 'mountain of copper'. It may also have been the source of finished bronze objects."
Writing instruments/devices and pigments
240 copper tablets with inscriptions and scores of metal impements, tools, weapons inscribed with Sarasvati Script are evidence of metalwork and competence to write on metal. Many Sarasvati Script inscriptions are



63
incised using a sharp stylus. Some inscriptions are hypertexts composed as raised script on metal. Some inscriptions on metal (for e.g. on a gold pendant) are written in some form of ink of ferric oxide or carbon black as pigment (perhaps using a writing brush). Some inscriptions are created with dotted orthography as on a gold fillet signifying the standard device which normally occurs in front of a one-horned young bull on many inscriptions. Hard metal styluses have been used to create over 240 copper plate Sarasvati Script inscriptions. Many copper inscriptions in bas-relief, raised script may have been used to created printed copies using ferric oxide ink. Evidence for writing in paint is provided by an inscription on a gold pendant and on pots with painted with Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs, for e.g. Susa pot with ‘fish’ hieroglyph and Nausharo pot showing a tied to a post.
Animals on Sarasvati Script are Meluhha metalwork hieroglyphic hypertexts, NOT totems
Animal pictographs in Sarasvati Script narratives are NOT totems. A totem is a symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of people, such as a family, clan, lineage, or tribe. The animal pictographs are NOT totems but hieroglyphs sacred symbols of kole.l 'smithy' which is kole.l 'temple; of pasara 'animals' rebus: pasara 'forge, smithy'.
meḍh 'ram' Rebus: meḍho 'one who helps a merchant' This is the explanation for the recurrence of a ram as a hieroglyph on hundreds of Dilmun, Persian Gulf seals.



64
Animals as hieroglyph signifiers is evident from these two examples. A 'joined animal' is created as a hypertext, composed of hieroglyph components: human face, horns of zebu, trunk of elephant, forefeet of a bovine, hindfeet of a feline, serpent-hood as upraised tail, scarves on neck.

aya, ayo 'fish' aya 'iron' (Gujarati) ayas 'metal alloy' (Rigveda.Samskrtam)
Section 6. Sarasvati Script Decipherment in the context of wealth creation, evidenced by Archaeometallurgy
"Benoit Mille has drawn attention to copper alloy 'amulets' discovered in the early Chalcolithic (late 5th millennium) levels of Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, Pakistan. He reported that metallographic examination established that the ornaments were cast by the lostwax method (Mille, B., 2006, 'On the origin of lost-wax casting and alloying in the Indo-Iranian world', in Metallurgy and Civilisation: 6th international conference on the beginnings of the use of metals and alloys, University of Science and Technology, Beijing, BUMA VI). The amulets were made from copper alloyed with lead. Mehrgarh is well recognised as a centre for early pyrotechnologies. The wax models of the amulets would have been solid and may have had a simple core inserted. This is understandably the first stage in the technology. Mille also draws attention to the 'Leopards weights' from Baluchistan, dating to about 3000 BCE which were made using a complex core keyed into the investment mould."(Davey, Christopher J., The early history of lost-wax casting, in: J. Mei and Th. Rehren, eds., Metallurgy and Civilisation: Eurasia and Beyond Archetype, London, 2009, ISBN 1234 5678 9 1011, pp. 147-154; p. 151).
Remarkable evidences of the excellence achieved in cire perdue metal castings are provided by bronze or copper alloy artifacts kept in the British Museum, said to have been acquired from Begram, and dated to ca. 2000 to 1500 BCE. These are also referred to as compartmented seals.

The cire perdue spoked wheel of copper+lead alloy was NOT an amulet, it was a metal artifact, a metal coin, akkam; it was a compartmental Harappa seal with Sarasvati (Indus) Script hieroglyph. May or may not have been used as a coin to value and exchange goods but a proclamation of the metallurgical excellence achieved by Bharatam Janam of 4th millennium BCE.

Shan craftsmen made drums there for the Karens from approximately 1820 until the town burned in 1889. Karen drums were cast by the lost wax technique; a characteristic that sets them apart from the other bronze drum types that were made with moulds. A five metal formula was used to create the alloy consisting of copper, tin, zinc, silver and gold. Most of the material in the



75
drums is tin and copper with only traces of silver and gold. The Karen made several attempts in the first quarter of the twentieth century to revive the casting of drums but none were successful."

The pinnacle of achievement in Bronze Age Revolution relates to the invention of cire perdue technique of metal castings to produce metal alloy sculptures of breath-taking beauty. This achievement is exemplified by Nihal Mishmar artifacts dated to ca. 5th millennium BCE.
Mehergarh. 2.2 cm dia. 5 mm reference scale. Perhaps coppper alloyed with

Octobre-Novembre 2007 - n° 312-313:54-60) have reported the finding (probably in the later still unreported excavation period) of small Chalcolithic “amulets” which they claim to have been produced by the process of Lost Wax. According to them, “The levels of the fifth millennium Chalcolithic at Mehrgarh have delivered a few amulets in shape of a minute wheel, while the technological study showed that they were made by a process of lost wax casting. The ring and the spokes were modelled in wax which was then coated by a refractory mould that was heated to remove the wax. Finally, the molten metal was



82
cast in place of the wax. Metallographic examination confirmed that it was indeed an object obtained by casting (dendrite microstructure). This discovery is quite unique because it is the earliest attestation of this technique in the world.” They then, further on, state that “The
development of this new technique of lost wax led to another invention, the development of alloys...Davey (Davey C. 2009.The Early History of Lost-Wax Casting, in J. Mei and Th. Rehren (eds), Metallurgy and Civilisation: Eurasia and Beyond Archetype, pp. 147-154.

Shahi Tump. Kech valley, Makran division, Baluchistan, Pakistan (After Fig. 1 in Thomas et al) Benoit Mille calls the bronze stamps of ShahiTump 'amulets' (made from copper alloyed with lead). Mehrgarh is well recognised as a centre for early pyrotechnologies.The wax models of the stamps would have been solid and may have had a simple core inserted.This is perhaps the first stage in the technology:"Small copper-base wheel-shaped “amulets” have been unearthed from the Early Chalcolithic levels at
Mehrgarh in Balochistan (Pakistan), dating from the late fifth millennium B.C. Visual and metallographic examinations prove their production by a lost-wax process—the earliest evidence so far for this metalworking



83
technique. Although a gap of more than 500 years exists between these ornaments from Mehrgarh and the later lost-wax casts known in the IndoIranian world, the technological and compositional links between these artefacts indicate a similar tradition. We already know that the lost-wax process was commonly used during the second half of the fourth millenium B.C, as exemplified by figurative pinheads and compartmented seals, the latter of which were produced and distributed across the region until the early second millennium B.C. Most, if not all, of these artefacts were made using the lost-wax technique. This intensive practice of lostwax casting certainly stimulated the technical development of the process, allowing the elaboration of more complex and heavier objects. The
“Leopards Weight” (Balochistan, late fourth or early third millennium B.C.) is one of the best examples of these developments: the lost-wax copper jacket, with its opened hollow shape, constitutes an extraordinary technical achievement.(Mille, B., Bourgarit, D., and Besenval, R. 2005. 'Metallurgical study of the 'Leopards weight' from Shahi-Tump (Pakistan)', in C. Jarrige and V. Lefevre, eds., South Asian Archaeology 2001, Editions Recherches sur les Civilisations, Paris: 237-44) True hollow casting does not appear until the third millennium B.C., as illustrated by the manufacture of statuettes, including the Nausharo bull figurine (Balochistan, 2300–2100 B.C.), or those from BMAC sites in Central Asia (based upon analyses of items in the Louvre collections). The birth of the lost-wax casting process can also be paralleled with the first emergence of alloying in South Asia, as many of these early lost-wax cast artefacts were made of a copper-lead alloy (c. 10–40 wt% Pb and up to 4 wt% As). Significantly, it seems that the copper-lead alloy was solely dedicated to artefacts made using the lost-wax technique, a choice no doubt driven by the advantageous casting properties of such an alloy."

Section 7. Conclusion & Executive Summary
Two unique discoveries resulted in a breakthrough to confirm the decipherment of Harappa Scrip Cipher as metalwork catalogues recorded in Meluhha language. The discoveries are: 1. Mohenjodaro three-sided tablet with Sarasvati Script inscription showing a boat loaded with ox-hide ingots 2. Three pure tin ingots found with Sarasvati Script inscriptions from a shipwreck in Haifa.
m1429 Mohenjodaro prism tablet. A hieroglyph to
signify bagalo ‘shipping vessel’ is bagala ‘Pleiades’. Such a hieroglyph showing 6 or 7 women as Pleiades is signified on three inscriptions of Sarasvati Script Corpora. bagalo = an Arabian merchant vessel (Gujarati) bagala = an Arab boat of a particular description (Ka.); bagalā (M.); bagarige, bagarage = a kind of vessel (Kannada) Rebus: bangala = kumpaṭi = angāra śakaṭī = a chafing dish a portable stove a goldsmith’s portable furnace (Telugu) cf. bangaru bangaramu = gold (Telugu) karaṇḍa ‘duck’ (Sanskrit) karaṛa ‘a very large aquatic bird’ (Sindhi) Rebus: करडा [karaḍā] Hard from alloy--iron, silver &c. (Marathi) A pair of palm trees flanking a pair of oxhide ingots.

Tin ingots in the Museum of Ancient Art of the Municipality of Haifa, Israel (left #8251, right #8252).
Three pure tin ingots each bear inscribed Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs; I have argued in a monograph in Journal of Indo-Judaic Studies, that the inscriptions were Meluhha hieroglyphs (Sarasvati Script writing)[19]. A



86
third ingot was found inscribed with an added hieroglyph: moulded head, hieroglyph: mũhe ‘face’ (Santali) Rebus: mũh ‘ingot’. Thus, the inscriptions on the tingots signify ranku dhatu mũh, ‘tin mineral ingot’.
These two discoveries PLUS the discovery of Susa pot containing metal implements confirm the function of Sarasvati Script to document trade transactions related to metalwork of Meluhha artisans. Significantly, they also point to the contributions made by Bharata seafaring merchants for transactions in tin trade to provide the important resource for the Tin
Bronze Revolution. The world’s major source of tin is the Mekong River delta of Ancient Far East. This has led to a hypothesis of a Maritime Tin Route from Hanoi to Haifa for further testing and researches.
Databases of Sarasvati Script7 inscriptions (which may also be called: Dharma saṁjñā – Corporate badges of responsibility or Bharata hieroglyphs) narrate the cultural, socio-economic history of a civilization. It is called Sarasvati Script since the discovery of the first inscription on a seal (surface find) from Harappa in 1872 reported by Cunningham8. The number of Sarasvati Script inscriptions total over 7000 (as of 2016). Select inscriptions with illustrations and details of decipherment are presented in a 799-page book: Sarasvati Script & Language9. This book is intended to be a basic resource for further historical researches on the Script and
Meluhha language and to complement the Mythic Society’s multi-volume History and Culture of Bharata. Examples presented in this article are taken from this book.
Sarasvati Script Corpora: an overview
Seafaring Meluhha merchants used Sarasvati Writing in trade transactions; artisans created metal artifacts, lapidary artifacts of terracotta, ivory for trade. Glosses of the Proto-Indic or Harappa language are used to read rebus the Sarasvati Script inscriptions.
The glyphs of the Sarasvati Script or Sarasvati Writing include both pictorial motifs and signs. Both categories of glyphs are read rebus. As a first step in delineating the Harappa language, an Indian lexicon10 provides a resource, compiled semantically in clusters of over 1240 groups of words/expressions from ancient Bharata languages as a Proto-Indic substrate dictionary.

The legs of the platform and the seat are feline; the fish is ligatured with six blobs to signify the hieroglyphic nature of the orthographic, sculptural frieze composition.
What unites the bizarre components of the composition (for e.g. spinner and fish on platform with feline legs) and a person with winnowing fan, is an example of rebus rendering, the mlecchita vikalpa, cryptography.
Spinner (kātī) lady rebus khātī 'wheelwright'; ayo ‘fish’ rebus: aya ‘iron’ ayas ‘alloy metal’ PLUS baTa ‘six’ rebus: bhaTa ‘furnace’ kola ‘tiger’ rebus: kol ‘working in iron, blacksmith’. kulā ʻwinnowing fan ʼ(Oriya) rebus: kol ‘working in iron’.
Framework of data mining to decode inscriptions
Mahadevan concordance of about 2000 inscriptions excludes inscribed objects which do not contain ‘texts’; for example, this concordance excludes about 50 seals inscribed with the ‘svastikā’ pictorial motif and a pectoral which contains the pictorial motif of a one-horned bull with a device in front and an over-flowing pot. Parpola concordance has been used to present such objects which also contain valuable orthographic data which may assist in decoding the inscriptions. Many broken objects are also contained in Parpola concordance which are useful, in many cases, to count the number of objects with specific ‘field symbols’, a count which



88
also provides some valuable clues to support the decoding of the messages conveyed by the ‘field symbols’ which dominate the object space.
In the process of normalizing the orthography of some glyphs to identify the core ‘signs’ of the script, some information is lost and at times, the
process itself impedes the possibility of decoding the writing system. This can be demonstrated by (1) the ‘identification’ of a ‘squirrel’ glyph and (2) the failure to identify ‘dotted circle’ or ‘stars’ as glyphs.
It is, therefore, necessary to view the inscribed object as a composite message composed of glyphs: pictorial motifs and signs alike. Many scholars have noted the contacts between the Mesopotamian and Sarasvati Sindhu (Indus) Civilizations, in terms of cultural history, chronology, artefacts (beads, jewellery), pottery and seals found from archaeological sites in the two areas.
Section 8. Some select Critical comments on the decipherment by other leading experts.
Gregory Possehl has provided a bibliography of attempts at decipherment of Sarasvati Script.11 This bibliography also includes reference to my preliminary attempts positing the possible economic context of the entire corpora of inscriptions. As research progressed and additional evidences could be collated from the civilizational contact areas of the Ancient Far East and Acient Near East, a new hypothesis has emerged, that of the Maritime Tin Route which linked Hanoi and Haifa, predating the Silk Road by two millennia. This is subject to further detailed researches and further excavations of all the sites of the civilization on the Vedic River Sarasvati Basin.
Historical researches by savants have led to the present state of knowledge which is poised for a paradigmatic shift in our understanding of the civilizational Pre-history. I invite a reference, in particular,to the 9th Maulana Azad Memorial Lecture delivered on November 11, 2016 by Prof. Shivaji Singh on the links between archaeology and the Veda to write afresh, the early history of Bharata. The full text of the lecture is at https://www.academia.edu/30071331/With_Veda_in_One_Hand_and_Spa de_in_the_Other_Writing_Early_History_of_India_Afresh_-_Lecture_by_Prof._Shivaji_Singh
Prof. Shivaji Singh notes: “So clear and decisive is this Sarasvati evidence (rediscovery of the Lost River Sarasvati with majority of Harappan sites in



89
its valley and other cultural and chronological facts that show that the Harappan Civilization should better be designated as Sarasvati Civilization) that many scholars, who earlier believed in Vedic-Harappan dichotomy and shared the view of Aryan arrival in India from outside, now, accept Vedic-Harappan identity. A noteworthy example of this shift in perception is presented by Prof. BB Lal who is an internationally recognized archaeologist and well-known for his extremely judicious approach. I name him particularly because as a former Director General, Archaeological Survey of India, he has been an eye witness and himself an active participant in harvesting much of that data and evidence we call the ‘Sarasvati evidence’...the Rigveda (3.53.14) refers to a people called KIkaTas and their leader Pramaganda. And, all the scholars including Griffith, the famous English translator of the text, agree that KIkaTas were a people of Magadha (South Bihar)...the episode of Videgha MAthava and his priest Gotama RAhugaNa reaching the banks of SadAnIrA (modern Gandak in Bihar) described in the Satapatha Brahmana (1.4.1.1417)...Gotama RAhugaNa is a famous Rigvedic Rishi, a scion of AngIrA family, who has composed as many as twenty of the Rigveda (1.74-93). The Satapatha Brahmana itself informs that the event behing described belongs to a bygone age. Is there any room left to doubt that this journey from Sarasvati to SadAnIrA took place in the Rigvedic period itself?...Bharatas were the greatest champions of the Yajnya-based Vedic ideology...it is Kalibanga that was the capital of the Bharatas...Indianness or Bharatiyata cannot be defined in geographical and political terms. It can be articulated only culturally as a set of values based on intuitive
recognition of transcendental spirituality...Bharatiyata or Indianness is
distinguished by a unique spiritual vision of life which the Rigvedic Rishis have bequeathed to humanity.”
With such a resonant call to write the integrated history of Bharata using spiritual texts of the Veda and archaeological evidences, the over 8000 inscriptions of Sarasvati Script provide a textual framework to outline the urban progress in the sphere of metallurgy, as active participants in the Bronze Age Revolution.
I submit that the decipherment announced in this monograph is consistent with the vision of integrated History and Culture of Bharata framed on the Veda and Archaeology. This integration is dramatically validated by a discovery reported in April 2015 by the Students of Institute of Archaeology, New Delhi of a yajnakunda found in Binjor together with a Sarasvati Script Seal. The decipherment has shown that a Soma SamsthA



90
Yaga was performed at Binjor. See: अष्टार्श्र यूप in yajna kunda Binjor (4MSR) archaeological evidence of Soma Yaga dated to ca. 2500 BCE. Significance of the discovery for Vedic and civilization studies http://tinyurl.com/zkwyh7s See also 744 monographs posted at https://independent.academia.edu/SriniKalyanaraman
I deem it a privilege that Prof. Shivaji Singh sought it fit to comment in a private communication: “I consider your work extremely important because you have broken the myth that Bharatiya tradition has downgraded the status of the artisans and placed them with the Shudras. In fact, it is this myth on which the entire structure of Subaltern history is based.”
I submit in all humility that if this monograph which outlines the framework of decipherment has contributed to a better understanding of the contributions made by Bharatam Janam to Bronze Age Revolution, it will be a precursor to the paradigm shift in early history of Bharata.
Principal reason for failures in past decipherment efforts
Received wisdom about Aryan Invasion as a ‘linguisticdoctrine’12 is also a principal reason for the polemics of dubious decipherment claims. It is heartening no note that many linguists now recognize the nature of the Bharata sprachbund. A language X is also proposed to explain the nature of lexical, semantic structures with common features noticed in many ancient Bharata languages explained by sustained sustained cultural contacts among the people of Bhāratam.
Since Sarasvati Script is NOT syllabic, long texts of inscriptions are NOT necessary for decipherment. Now that over 7000 inscriptions are available, there is enough evidence to unravel the cipher of Sarasvati Script. Recognizing the metalwork catalogues of Sarasvati Script Corpora, the contributions of Bhāratam Janam to the Bronze Age Revolution and as intermeḍiaries along the Maritime Tin Route which preceded the Silk Road by 2 millennia, can be re-evaluated and the Bronze Age interaction maps can be re-drawn.
It is a leap of faith to rush to judgement that Sarasvati Script is NOT based on language because the length of inscriptions is very short (composed of upto 5 symbols). It has been demonstrated from the evolution of Egyptian hieroglyphs from ca. 32nd cent. BCE that short texts as inscriptions are read rebus. If each symbol or hieroglyph is logo-phonetic, words and



91
combinations of words are identifiable on hypertexts created by Sarasvati Script.
Momentous, defining discovery of Vedic cultural foundations of
Bharata
Discovery of Binjor Vedic fire-altar with an octagonal Yūpa and a seal inscribed with Harapp Script by students of Institute of Archaeology of
India Museum in 2015 is momentous. It conclusively establishes the Vedic culture continuum in Vedic River Sarasvati Basin because the octagonal Yūpa is a signature tune of a Soma Yaga Samstha. The seal of Binjor is a metalwork catalogue. Octagonal shape is the rudra bhāga of
linga metaphored as Pillar of light and fire. cf. skambha sukta Atharvaveda (AV X.7,8).
A remarkable archaeological evidence validates the Vedic culture and provides an indication of the spoken language of the people who invented and used Sarasvati Script. The evidence is from Binjor (near Anupgarh) in an archaeological site called 4MSR. At this site, agni kunda with aṣṭāśri Yūpa was found evidencing the performance of a Soma Yaga. Vajapeya is one of 7 samstha (profession) for processing/smelting soma (a mineral, NOT a herbal): सोमः [सू-मन् Uṇ.1.139]-सोंस्था a form of the Soma-sacrifice; (these are
seven:- अर्ग्नष्टोम , अष्टत्यर्ग्नोम , उक्थ , षोढशी, अर्रात्र , आप्तोयाणम and वाजपेय). The Vajapeya performeḍ in Binjor and Kalibangan should have been related to the Soma-samstha: सोमः सोंस्था specified as वाजपेय with the shape of the Yūpa with eight- or four-angles. For every Soma Yaga such a Yūpa is installed. 19 such Yūpas have been found in Rajasthan, Allahabad, Mathura and East Borneo.13 At the Vājapeya, the yūpa is eight-angled (as in Binjor), corresponding to the eight quarters (Sat.Br. V.2.1.5 aṣṭāśrir yūpo bhavati) अर्श्र [p= 114,2] f. the sharp side of anything , corner , angle (of a room or house) , edge (of a sword) S3Br. Ka1tyS3r. often ifc. e.g. अष्टा *र्श्र , र्त्रर् -/अर्श्र , च्/अुर्र् -र्श्र , शर्ा *र्श्र q.v. (cf. अश्र ) ;([cf. Lat. acies , acer ; Lith. assmu3]). “The first Yūpa inscription of Mulavarman (in East Borneo) was erected to commemorate a bahusuvarnaka sacrifice,'that on which gold is spent (used?) in profusion'.”14 I suggest that bahu-suvarnaka refers to the many wealth-giving metals worked in a Soma Yaga.

Sarasvati Script hieroglyphs on priest statue of Mohenjo-daro signify dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron-smelter', pot ̥r, पोतृ'purifier'
The ‘purifier’ is also a dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron-smelter'. Metallurgical smelting process is a process of purification. Purification of minerals is achieved through smelting in fire.
The hieroglyph signifiers are related to some etyma of Bharata sprachbund in this addendum. vaṭa- string, rope, tie (Samskrtam) is signified by the string which ties the 'dotted circle' on the forehead and right-shoulder of the Priest. The rebus reading is: -vaḍ వటగ 'clever, skilful' (Telugu).

[√dhā]
Thus, the 'dotted circle' dhāī ̃ PLUS vaṭa 'string' is read: dhā̆ vaḍ 'smelter'. The uttarīyam ̃ worn by the Priest is potta -- , °taga -- , °tia -- n. ʻ cotton cloth ʼ (Prakrtam) potti 'cloth' (Kannada) Rebus: Pot ̥r, पोतर् 'purifier' Priest

The fillet worn on the forehead and on the right-shoulder signifies one strand; while the trefoil on the shawl signifies three-strands.
Single strand (one dotted-circle)
Two strands (pair of dotted-circles)

These orthographic variants provide semantic elucidations for a single: dhātu, dhāū, dhāv 'red stone mineral' or two minerals: dul PLUS dhātu, dhāū, dhāv 'cast minerals’ or tri- dhātu, -dhāū, dhāv 'three minerals’ to create metal alloys’. The artisans producing alloys

Semantics of single strand of rope and three strands of rope are: 1. Sindhi dhāī f. ʻ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ʼ, Lahnda dhāī ̃ id.; 2. tridhāˊtu -- ʻ threefold ʼ (RigVeda)
Evolution ḍha-, dha- in Brahmi script syllables are evocative of 'string' and 'circle, dotted circle' as may be seen from the following orthographic evidence of epigraphs dated from ca. 300 BCE:
It may be seen from the table of evoution of Brahmi script orthography that
1. a circle signified the Brahmi syllable 'ṭha-' and a dotted circle signified the syllable 'tha-';
2. a string with a twist signified the syllable 'da-', a string ending in a circled twist signified the syllable 'ḍha-' and a stepped string signified the syllable 'ḍa-'.

Thus, the two cire perdue statues of women and the hieroglyph on Bhirrana potsherd signify: metal furnace turner, merchant.
These are clear, unambiguous evidences of the spoken language (Mleccha or Proto-Prakritam of Bharata sprachbund) which is a continuum of the Vedic culture exemplified by chandas of 10,800 Rigveda rica-s. Complementing the rica-s are the Sarasvati Script Corpora with over 7000 inscriptions. Both resources are veritable data mines for further historical researches in Vedic culture continuum in Bharata, economic history with particular reference to Bharata’s archaeo-metallurgy contributions to
Bronze Age Revolution and formation/evolution of Bharata languages. One hypertext comes closest to a metaphor in Vedic cultural tradition. It is in the depiction of three faces on a horned person seated in penance (Seal m0304). Vedic metaphor is related to Vis’vakarma, Tvasta. He may signify Triśiras, son of Tvaṣţā, कु बेर. Such a parallel interpretation is consistent with 1) decipherment of hieroglyphs on the seal m0304, 2) the Germanic tradition of Tuisto, Father of Germanic people, 3) tatara 'smelter' (Japanese), 4) ṭhaṭherā 'brassworker' (Sindhi), 5)
kamaḍha ‘penance’ Rebus: kammaṭa ‘mint, coiner, coinage’.
Are the torcs on Karnonou (Cernunnos) corporate badges (bracelets) of dharma samjnA? If so, karã̄ n. pl. ʻ wristlets, bangles ʼ (Gujarati) Rebus: khār 'blacksmith'
Triśiras 'three heads’ of person seated in penance Seal m0304.
Germanic people are divided into three large branches, the Ingaevones, the Herminones and the Istaevones. Their ancestry is derived from three sons of Mannus, son of Tuisto, their common forefather. (Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Germania, 98 CE). Tuisto is equated to the Vedic Tvaṣṭṛ.15 It is possible that the three branches of people associated with Tuisto may explain the metaphor of three heads, triśiras remembered from Rigvedic tradition: र्त्र --र्शरस् [p= 460,3] mfn. three-headed (त्व ाष्ट र , author of RV.x,8) Ta1n2d2yaBr. xvii

The kāraṇī or kāraṇīka, ‘helmsman’ signified on Seal m0304 may also relate to karnonou (Cernunnos) on the Pillar of Boatmen of 1st cent., CE.
Another possibility is that the three heads signified on seal m0304 may relate to Kubera ~Triśiras,son of Tvaṣţā of Rigveda. One meaning of tvāṣṭra त्व ाष्ट र is
'copper’. mũhe ‘face’ (Santali) Rebus: mũh ‘ingot’ PLUS kolmo ‘three’ rebus: kolimi ‘smihy, forge’. Thus, the orthography of ‘three faces’ may signify pewter, bronze, brass. (three alloys of copper formed by adding zinc and tin in varying proportions). Hence, the rebus reding to signify coppersmith, brass worker, bronze worker: *ṭhaṭṭhakāra ʻ brass worker ʼ. 2. *ṭhaṭṭhakara -- . [*ṭhaṭṭha -- 1, kāra -- 1]1.

Bharata artisanal competence in metals technologies is exemplified by Wootz (ukku) steel sword presented by Purushottama (Porus) to Alexander on the banks of Jhelum river and Delhi (Besnagar) or Kodachadri nonrusting iron pillars.

bronze statues are exemplars of the Bronze Age Revolution which
impacted Bharatam Janam, ‘metalcaster folk’, an expression used by Viśvamitra in Rigveda (RV 3.53.12).
Significance of Sarasvati Script decipherment to explain the wealth of Bharatam ca 1 CE
It is a fact of great historical significance that Bharata accounted for 32.9% of World GDP in 1 CE.16
At the turn of the Common Era, Bharata was indeed a land of bahusuvarnaka, riches of gold and metallurgical excellence as evidenced by the decipherment of Sarasvati Script.
This cultural continuity foundation built over millennia sets the tone and tenor for the History and Culture of Bharata.

Select inscriptions of Sarasvati Script Corpora
Background
Seafaring meluhhan merchants used Indus Writing in trade transactions; artisans created metal artifacts, lapidary artificats of terracotta, ivory for trade. Glosses of the proto-Indic or Meluhha language are used to read rebus the Sarasvati script inscriptions.
The glyphs of the Sarasvati script or Indus Writing include both pictorial motifs and signs and both categories of glyphs are read rebus. As a first step in delineating the Indus language, an Indian lexicon17 provides a resource, compiled semantically cluster over 1240 groups of glosses from ancient Indian languages as a proto-Indic substrate dictionary.
The evidence is remarkable that many single glyphs or glyptic elements of the Indus writing can be read rebus using the repertoire of artisans (lapidaries working with precious shell, ivory, stones and terracotta, mine-workers, stone-masons, metal-smiths working with a variety of minerals, furnaces and other tools) who created the inscribed objects and used many of them to authenticate their trade transactions. Many of the inscribed objects are seen to be calling cards of the professional artisans, listing their professional skills and repertoire. Many are veritable mining- and metal-work catalogs.
Continuing legacies of glyptic art noted by Huntington: “There is a continuity of composite creatures demonstrable in Indic culture since Kot Diji ca. 4000 BCE.”18
The identification of glosses from the present-day languages of India on Sarasvati river basin is justified by the continuation of culture evidenced by many artifacts evidencing civilization continuum from the Vedic Sarasvati River basin, since language and culture are intertwined, resulting in a unique, logo-semantic writing system. .
Sarasvati Script in Ancient Near East is a tribute to the Meluhhan artisans who have established an expansive contact area in Eurasia and left for posterity the bronze-age harosheth hagoyim, ‘the smithy of nations.’

‘Pict-‘ Pictorial motifs ( 0 to 145) described as illustrations of field-symbols in Appendix III of Mahadevan corpus (pp. 793 to 813); ‘it’ inscribed tablet; ‘si’ seal impression; ‘t’ tablet.
Illegible inscribed objects are excluded in the following tabulations. Many potsherds Rahmandheri and Nausharo are excluded since the ‘signs’ are considered to be potters’ marks; only those inscriptions which appear to have parallels of field symbols or ‘signs’ in the corpora are included.
Based on a number of resources and from the collections of inscribed objects held in many museums of the world, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Indus Writing Corpora include Sarasvati heiroglyphs, representing many facets of glyptic art of Sarasvati Civilization. The corporas also includes many texts of inscriptions, corresponding to the epigraphs inscribed on objects. The compilation is based mostly on published photographs in archaeological reports right from the days of Alexander Cunningham who discovered a seal at Harappa in 1875, of Langdon at Mohenjodaro (1931) and of Madhu Swarup Vats at Harappa (1940). The corpus includes objects collected in India, Pakistan, other countries and the finds of the excavations at Harappa by Kenoyer and Meadow during the seasons 1994-1995 and 1999-2000.
Primary resources for decoding epigraphs of Sarasvati Sindhu Civilization
This is also intended to serve as a pictorial and text index to Mahadevan Concordance and to the three volumes published so far of pictorial corpus of Parpola et al.
Many texts are indexed to the text numbers of Mahadevan concordance. The choice of this concordance is based on four factors: (a) the concordance is priced at a reasonable cost; (b) it is a true concordance for every sign of the corpus to facilitate an analysis of the frequency of occurrence of a sign and the context of other sign clusters/ sequences in relation to a sign and for researchers to cross-check on the basic references for the
inscribed objects; (c) the exquisite nature of orthography is notable and ‘readings’ are authentic, even for very difficult to read inscriptions; and (d) signs and variants of signs have been delineated with cross-references to selected text readings.
Mahadevan concordance excludes inscribed objects which do not contain ‘texts’; for example, this concordance excludes about 50 seals inscribed with the ‘svastikā’ pictorial motif and a pectoral which contains the pictorial motif of a one-horned bull with a device in front and an over-flowing pot. Parpola concordance has been used to present such objects which also contain valuable orthographic data which may assist in decoding the inscriptions. Many broken objects are also contained in Parpola concordance which are useful, in many cases, to count the number of objects with specific ‘field symbols’, a
count which also provides some valuable clues to support the decoding of the messages conveyed by the ‘field symbols’ which dominate the object space.

In most cases, these text numbers are matched with the inscribed objects after Asko Parpola concordance [Two volumes: Rs. 21,000: 1.

Memoir of ASI No. 96 Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions, Vol. II by Asko Parpola, B.M. Pande and Petterikoskikallio (containing copper tablets) is in press (December 2001).
The debt owed to Iravatham Mahadevan, Asko Parpola, Archaeological Survey of India, Department of Archaeology and Museums, Govt. of Pakistan and Finnish Academy for making this presentation possible is gratefully acknowledged. I am grateful to Iravatham Mahadevan who made available to me his annotated personal copy of a document which helped in collating the texts with the pictures of inscribed objects. [Kimmo Koskenniemi and Asko Parpola, 1980, Cross references to Mahadevan 1977 in: Documentation and Duplicates of the Texts in the Indus Script, Helsinki, pp. 26-32].
Four epigraphs from Bhirrana from ASI website http://asi.nic.in and five epigraphs from Bagasra (Gola Dhoro) reported by VH Sonawane in Puratattva, Number 41, 2011 have also been included.
Pitfalls of normalising orthography of some glyphs
Parpola (1994) identifies 386 (+12?) signs (or graphemes) and their variant forms. Mahadevan (1977) identifies 419 graphemes; out of these 179 graphemes have variants totalling 641 forms.
Parpola observes: "...the grapheme count might be as low as 350...The total range of signs once present in the Sarasvati Script is certain to have been greater than is observable now, for new signs have kept turning up in new inscriptions. The rate of discovery has been fairly low, though, and the new signs have more often been ligatures of two or more signs already known as separate graphemes than entirely new signs." (Parpola, 1994, p. 79)
Many ‘signs’ are ligatures of two or more ‘signs’.
In the process of normalizing the orthography of some glyphs to identify the core ‘signs’ of the script, some information is lost and at times, the process itself impedes the possibility of decoding the writing system. This can be demonstrated by (1) the
‘identification’ of a ‘squirrel’ glyph and (2) the failure to identify ‘dotted circle’ or ‘stars’ as glyphs.



108
It is, therefore, necessary to view the inscribed object as a composite message composed of glyphs: pictorial motifs and signs alike. Many scholars have noted the contacts between the Mesopotamian and Sarasvati Sindhu (Indus) Civilizations, in terms of cultural history, chronology, artefacts (beads, jewellery), pottery and seals found from archaeological sites in the two areas.
An outstanding contribution to the study of the script problem is the publication of the Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions (CISI) Three volumes have been published so far:
Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions, 1. Collections in India, Helsinki, 1987 (eds. Jagat Pati Joshi and Asko Parpola)
Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions, 2. Collections in Pakistan, Helsinki, 1991 (eds. Sayid Ghulam Mustafa Shah and Asko Parpola)
Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions, 3. 1 Supplement to Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, 2010 (eds. Asko Parpola, B.M. Pande and Petteri Koskikallio) in collaboration with Richard H. Meadow and Jonathan Mark Kenoyer. (Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae, B. 239-241.) Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia.
These volumes in which Asko Parpola is the co-author constitute the photographic corpus. The CISI contains all the seals including those without any inscriptions, for e.g. those with the geometrical motif called the ‘svastika’. Parpola’s initial corpus (1973)
included a total number of 3204 texts. After compiling the pictorial corpus, Parpola notes that there are approximately 3700 legible inscriptions (including 1400 duplicate inscriptions, i.e. with repeated texts). Both the concordances of Parpola and Mahadevan complement each other because of the sort sequence adopted. Parpola’s concordance was sorted according to the sign following the indexed sign. Mahadevan’s concordance was sorted according to the sign preceding the indexed sign. The latter sort ordering helps in delineating signs which occur in final position. With the publication of CISI Vol. 3, Part 1, the total number of inscriptions from Mohenjo-daro totals 2134 and from Harappa totals 2589; thus, these two sites alone accounting for 4,723 bring the overall total number of inscriptions to over 6,000 from all sites (even after excluding comparable inscriptions on ‘Persian Gulf type’ circular seals from the total count).
Compendia of the efforts made since the discovery by Gen. Alexander Cunningham, in 1875, of the first known Indus seal (British Museum 1892-12-10, 1), to decipher the script appear in the following references:

It is seen from an enlargement of the bottom portion of the seal impression that the ‘prostrate person’ may not be a person but a ligature of the neck of an antelope with rings on its necks or of a post with ringstones. The head of the ‘person’ is not shown. So, I would surmise that this is an artist's representation of an act of copulation (by an animal) + a ligatured neck of another bovine or alternatively, a pillar with ring-stones ligatured to the bottom portion of a body. It is not uncommon in the artistic tradition to ligature bodies to the rump of, for example, a bull's posterior ligatured to a horned woman (Pict. 103 Mahadevan) or standing person with horns and bovine features (hoofed legs and/or tail) -- Pict. 86-88 Mahadevan.
Bison (gaur) trampling a prostrate person (?) underneath. Impression of a seal from Chanhujodaro (Mackay 1943: pl. 51: 13). The prostrate
‘person’ is seen to have a very long neck, possibly with neck-rings, reminiscent of the rings depicted on the neck of the onehorned bull normally depicted in front of a standard
device. 6114 Pict-108

Two horned heads one at either end of the body. Note the dottings on the thighs which is a unique artistic feature of depicting a rhinoceros (the legs are like those of a rhinoceros?). The body apparently is a combination of two rhinoceroses with heads of two bulls
attached on either end of the composite body.
