# Index for Meet International Ministries – Trinity is Baal Worship!.pdf

Ba'al (ba®al;Arabic,ÈÚá; Hebrew: áòì)
(ordinarily spelled Baal in English) is a
Northwest Semitic title and honorific meaning
"master" or "lord" that is used for various gods
who were patrons of cities in the Levant, cognate
to Assyrian Bçlu. A Baalist means a worshipper
of Baal.
Nombre jeroglífico:
Transliteración: bal
Iconografía: Dios cananita y del área semítico occidental que penetró en Egipto con los hiksos y se identificó con el dios egipcio Set
"Ba'al" can refer to any god and even to human officials. In some texts it is used as a substitute
for Hadad, a god of the rain, thunder, fertility and agriculture, and the lord of heaven. Since only pagan
priests were allowed to utter his supposed divine name Hadad, Ba'al was used commonly.
Nevertheless, few if any Biblical uses of "Ba'al" refer to Hadad, the lord over the assembly of gods
on the holy mount of Heaven.
But rather Hadad refers to any number of local spirit-deities worshipped as cult images, each
called ba'al and regarded as a false god.

Judges 2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth!
"Long ago - right after the Flood, a man named Nimrod began to be a mighty
1
one against God, a son begat by Cush who was begat by Ham, the burnt one. Nimrod
established his apostasy kingdom in Nineveh and Babylon the city/kingdoms he had
built. It is later prophesied to be destroyed that, ‘Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded,
Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in
pieces.’2
When Nimrod, that is Tammuz for he was the father and the son at the same time died, the Bible states
there was great weeping by women for him at the gate of the Lord’s house which was an abomination. It also goes on to state that there was a greater abomination when about twenty five men had their backs towards
the temple of God and facing the sun, worshiped it toward the east, Ba'al worship.3
His wife Semiramis recognized that without him she might loose her position of power, so she devised
a clever plan. Semiramis became pregnant and told everyone that the child in her womb was none other than
Nimrod being reborn with the name Tammuz. This was the beginning of the greatest perversion against God
ever devised by satan and those he would use to propagate it, the concept of a pagan ba'al 'father/son' deity."
"Semiramis became pregnant after Nimrod's death. And to cover up her
indiscretion she claimed that her baby was Nimrod reincarnated. So now she claimed
that he was both the Father and the son making herself also divine. Still she is
worshipped directly and indirectly by millions by the name of Mary, mother of god.
The supposed divine mother who gave birth to this divine son was Isis, the Egyptian name for Semiramis. Thus there were now three gods to whom worship
was due– A PAGAN TRINITY, a father god, a son god, and a holy mother
goddess--and all of these were to be considered equal parts of a triune god like ba'al."
"After Nimrod’s death, Semiramis claimed his son Horus, that is Tammuz to have been Nimrod reincarnated.
These three—Osiris (Nimrod), Isis (Semiramis) and Horus (the son)-came to be exalted as a triad of deities.4
Resurrection Sunday and the Babylonian Connection, The UN-Holy Trinity
"Semiramis replaced the emperor ship of Nimrod with this new trinitarian religion. She indoctrinated
her "divine son" into this religion, teaching him the Babylonian mystery of the three gods in one, and she set
him up as the first high priest or Pontifex Maximus of trinitarianism."
"At first the people had to be convinced that this trinity was really true. In response, Semiramis offered
a golden cup of intoxicants to the people who would come to pay tribute to her and her divine son. These
concoctions dulled their senses, convincing them to submit to initiation into the Babylonian mysteries of the
three separate gods as one god. She at the same time indoctrinated some of the people into a priesthood."

"All Pagan religions from the time of Babylon have adopted in one form or another - a Trinity doctrine
or a ba'al triad of gods.
In Babylon it was Nimrod, Semiramis, and Tammuz.
In Egypt it was Osiris, Isis, and Horus.
In Plato's philosophy it was the Unknown Father, Nous/Logos, and the world
soul. Plato began his philosophical career under the guidance of Socrates. When
Socrates died he traveled to Egypt and Italy studied in Pythagoras and then remained
as an advisor for the rulers of Syracuse. When he returned to Athens around the age
of forty he started his own academy, where he tried to impart the Socratic style of
teaching to his students. The Academy operated till 529 A.D. after which it was closed,
thinking it was a threat to Christianity.
The Greek triad was composed of Zeus, Athena and Apollo.
Romans had their Trinity of Jupiter, Mercury and
Venus.

The Hindus had their trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva."5
"Many ancient pagan nations had three headed gods and a trinity doctrine. All
these have existed from ancient times, and originated with Nimrod, a mighty hunter against God in Babylon."6
The Stella to the right is the first symbol of Ba'al Sun worship which has very
deep meanings that are spiritual and sexual with fertility rights. See the authors booklet

"Semiramis was initially included in the pagan Babylonian trinity as the holy
spirit and her symbol was that of the dove. Deified as Ishtar, she was raised far above the
7
level of all creatures, and was worshipped as the third member of this pagan trinitarian
godhead. It’s interesting that the ancient Babylonians pronounced the name Ishtar in
exactly the same way as we pronounce the word Easter."8
The concept of a trinity godhead system goes back to the first city nation called
Babylon which was built after the flood in Noah’s day. This took place during the time of Nimrod and
Semiramis. In this first pagan trinity - Nimrod the king was the first person, Semiramis his Queen was the
second person, and Tammuz their son was the third person, of this godhead system."9
Trinity - Ba'al Worship Spread Like A Cancer after the flood.
Prior to the flood, God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination
of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the
earth, and it grieved him at his heart. The earth was also corrupt and full of violence, therefore GOD said, “I
WILL DESTROY THEM WITH THE EARTH.”10

The trinity form of baal worship comes from a hideous rebellious spirit. Ham came through the flood
in the ark of Noah into the new world and is known as the burnt one because of his deeds after the flood.
The scripture states in Genesis 9:22, that Ham “saw the nakedness of his father” Noah. According to
a most highly acclaimed Jewish Historian, Moses Maimonides who wrote, “The Guide for the Perplexed” on
page 264, he states that when a man sees the nakedness of a man as Ham had done, it means a homosexual
relation took place with his father. The scripture says this also that when Noah awoke from his wine, “he knew
what his younger son had done unto him.”11
Since the scripture in Leviticus 20:11 tells us that seeing ones nakedness is to lay with that person. The
12
rebellion of Cush’s father Ham became the seed that was passed to and became the root of Nimrod’s apostasy
against GOD. From it came an international pagan religion that spread throughout the world that started in
Babylon. Thus from Semiramis came a whole new type of paganism. Some of this religion contained the
worship of the sun, moon and stars as god as declared in scripture, but most importantly, it produced the triune
god with Nimrod being god. Nimrod became incarnate in the son through the spirit of satan, and Semiramis
became the first Madonna. Thus this trinitarian - baal rebellious religion was formed and spread into all the
world.
"After the flood of Noah’s day is when Nineveh and Babylon were built by Nimrod. Their disobedient actions
brought judgement from God and the city/kingdoms were destroyed. The inhabitants were scattered from the
13
tower of Babel which was a part of the city kingdoms, but still they continued their pagan creeds and took the
doctrine of Nimrod/Semiramis/Tammuz with them. Thus the earth was in a repopulation process with a pagan
trinity - baal religion that started in Babylon. Even in their new languages the general characteristics of the
trinity-baal system remained the same. This system eventually infected the Christian religious world in AD and
is spoken of in hidden detail in Revelations chapters seventeen and eighteen."14
"So utterly idolatrous was the Babylonian recognition of their divine unity, that the ONE True GOD
Yah , the I AM, the El Shaddai, severely condemned His own people for giving any credence to it. In the unity
15
of that one and only god of the Babylonians, there were three persons, and to symbolize that doctrine of the
trinity, they employed the equilateral triangle as it is well known. Even as the Church of Rome and their harlots
do to this day. In both cases such a comparison is most degrading to the King Eternal."16
"A great deal of regalia and pomp accompanied this pagan trinitarian religion.The Pontifex Maximus,
or "chief priest," wore a great hat or miter shaped like a fish as the Pope does even to this day, since they said
that Nimrod had originally come into the world from the sea. These narration's show Nimrod's identity with the

Philistine fish god Dagon. The Pontifex Maximus held a shepherd's crosier,
representing the fact that Nimrod had been the "shepherd king" who herded the
people into cities after the flood. And the Pontifex Maximus bore with him the
"keys of Janus and Cybele, keys representing the "mysteries" brought into the
world by Nimrod and Semiramis."
"This trinitarian - baal religion spread all over the world. The people of
Greece got their religion from Phoenicia and Egypt which had both been part
of Nimrod's empire. Rome also got its religion from Phoenicia and Egypt. This
pagan religion trinity worship spread throughout Europe, so that the Druids in
England, the Norsemen, the Danes, the Norwegians, and the Germans all had
the same trinity - baal gods, only under different names."
"The throne of satan did not die -It was continued in the kingship of Pergamum in Asia Minor, which
is Turkey today. The second chapter of the Book of Revelations describes Pergamum as the city of satan's
throne (Revelations 2:12-13) where trinitarian - baal paganism entered Christianity. Once the kingship of
Pergamum died out, the position of Pontifex Maximus needed a new home. The pagan triune god found its new
capital city in Rome."
"Pergamos itself became part and parcel of the Roman Empire, when Attalus III, the last of the kings,
at his death, left by will all his dominions to the Roman people, B.C. 133."17
"When Julius Caesar, who had previously been elected Pontifex Maximus became also, as emperor, the
supreme civil ruler of the Romans, then, as head of the Roman state, and as head of the Roman religion, all the
powers and functions of the true legitimate Babylonian Pontiff were supremely vested in him, and he found
himself in a position to assert these powers. Then, on certain occasions, in the exercise of his high pontifical
office, he appeared in all the pomp of the Babylonian costume, as Belshazzar [an ancient Pontifex Maximus
of Babylon himself] might nave done, in robes of scarlet, with the crosier of Nimrod in his hand, wearing the
miter of Dagon and bearing the keys of Janus and Cybele."18
"The trinity originated with Babylon, and was passed on to most of the world's religions. The idea of
"God the Son" is Babylonian paganism and mythology that was grafted into Christianity. Historical Background
of the Trinity.19
Nimrod's Trinity Continues Today in Rome
"Semiramis--who was Ashtoreth to the Jews, Aphrodite in Greece, Venus in
Rome, known also as Astarte, Ishtar, Aurora, Diana, Rhea, Urania, and Isis--was
worshipped now as Jesus' mother Mary. These pagan practices and concepts of the
trinity continue in full bloom today in the Catholic church!" "Some of this trinitarian
religion retained worshiping the sun, moon and stars as god, but most importantly, it

produced the triune god of Babylon Nimrod becoming incarnate in the son through the Holy Spirit, and
Semiramis being the first Madonna. Thus this trinitarian religion was born into the world."
"In Babylon the planet Venus was revered and was worshipped as a Trinity consisting of Venus, the moon and
the sun. This triad became the Babylonian holy Trinity in the fourteenth century before Christ. Other religions
for thousands of years before Christ- also worshipped triune gods."20
"In 325 A.D. at the Council of Nicea in Rome, Constantine made an official decree combining the
doctrine of the pagan trinity with the Revelation of Jesus Christ. The trinity became the law of the Roman
empire. If anyone refused to accept the new trinity with Jesus as the physically incarnated divine son of the
father god, they would be put to death."
"The doctrine that Jesus Christ - 'the Son of God' - was - 'God the son' - was decreed by worldly and
ecclesiastical powers. Men were forced to accept it at the point of the sword or else. Thus, the error of the trinity
was propounded to the end that ultimately people believed it to be the truth. Thus Christianity became in
essence like 'Babylonian heathenism', with only a veneer of Christian names."21
“But they have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalam, which their fathers
taught them.” Jeremiah 9:14
One of the most horrifying and blasphemous paintings ever produced
was the Tyrolean (Ca 1516) Trinity which even the Catholics revolted because
of it. Rebellion against God!
It was an attempt by a Tyrolean artist from Tyrol, a Catholic region in
Austria so people could comprehend the doctrine of the Trinity as set forth in
the Athanasian Creed. Tyrol is probably the most Catholic of all the regions of
Austria, itself a predominantly Catholic nation.
"The trinitarian pagan clergy withheld the Bible from the people for over a
thousand years in order to firmly establish the trinity in Christianity."
The so called Christian Trinity! Who was behind this deception?
"The apostle John described satan the devil as having “deceived the whole world” (Rev. 12:9). His goal
has been to keep man from having a relationship with his Creator Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul described
22
satan as “the god of this world” who “has blinded them that believe not.”23
Is it strange to think of satan as this world’s god? Does this seem impossible to believe? Yet, there it is

in your Bible. After all, as arch-deceiver, what would the devil most want to deceive—blind—mankind to, other
than the identity of the true God?" Apostle Paul speaks of satan having the ability to deceive by transforming
24
himself into an angel of light.
"In fact, you will learn that satan, an evil spirit is the author of the trinity - baal doctrine — and that this
false god is a counterfeit—a substitute deity—designed to deceive millions into unwittingly worshiping him,
while thinking they are serving the God of the Bible."
The "Trinity" was a Major Part of the Foretold Apostasy
A Major Departure From The Jewish Messiah's Teachings
A Major Departure From The Apostle's Teachings (All 12 Apostles were Jewish)
"During the second century, the Apostle Polycarp, who had been trained by John, had to confront this
apostate movement: “The steady progress of the heretical movement in spite of all opposition was a cause of
deep sorrow to Polycarp, so that in the last years of his life these words were constantly on his lips, ‘Oh good
God, to what times hast thou spared me, that I must suffer such things!25’
"Both Polycarp and his successor, Polycrates, witnessed the wholesale departure of organized
Christianity from observing Passover on the 14th of the first month of the sacred calendar, to the observance
of Easter, a pagan holiday. The few who held to the original teachings. A faithful minority in Asia Minor, along
with the Nazarenes of Syria, were the last holdouts of true Christianity in the eastern Mediterranean area of the
Roman Empire."26
"Secular history also shows how false leaders changed the direction of the Church and cast out the few
brethren who remained loyal to the apostles’ original teachings. And that apostasy, (which threw away the
teachings of Christ), was called “orthodox”—while the small, remnant of the original Jewish Apostolic Church
was suppressed, persecuted and forced into hiding."
Philosophy and the Trinity
"Since the concept of triad deities permeated all ancient religions, Plato was deeply ingrained with
trinitarian thought. Ignoring the Bible, men came to regard Plato’s definition of the trinity as mankind’s best
effort to define God. The first-century Apostles rejected the idea of using philosophy to interpret Scripture."27

“Metaphysics and speculative theories were valueless for the Apostle Paul."28
"In Colossians 2:8, Paul warns against absorbing philosophy, calling it a vain and worldly deceit:
“Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.” In I Timothy 6:20-21, Paul is even more direct: “O Timothy, keep
that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babbling, and oppositions of science falsely
so called which some professing have erred concerning the faith.” Here, the Greek word for “science” is Gnosis.
Clearly, Paul condemns Gnosticism. And his example reflected the position of the first-century Church in
condemning all philosophy in general."29
"The first chapter of Romans describes the ancient philosophers, including Plato, and how they had
rejected the true God and His divine authority, and engaged in vile personal conduct (vs. 18-32). Inspired by
God, Paul describes their philosophical conclusions as being as much an abomination as their promiscuous
perversions. Yet, the form of Christianity that came to dominate the religious scene during the third and fourth
centuries exalted these philosophers’ opinions. Their human reasoning and speculation were viewed as a pillar
of understanding, and were used to interpret Scripture."
The "trinity" was Adopted in Nicea by a Pagan Emperor
"The Council of Nicea, the first ecumenical council of the Catholic Church, was conducted at
Constantine’s imperial summer residence in Nicea of Bithynia, from May 20th until July 25th, A.D. 325."
"Constantine recognized the political benefit of aligning with established Christianity. Not only did he
credit it for establishing him as emperor, but he understood its potential for serving as a means to unify the
empire. Constantine had the authority to force everyone—pagan and all brands of Christianity—into either
conformity or exile. The trinity was decreed to be doctrine in the Roman Empire. But it was not until A.D.
381, at the Council of Constantinople, that the Catholic Church finally adopted the Nicene Creed, which
officially approved the trinity doctrine."30
An Incredible Fact! Man-Made Philosophy Takes precedence over the Bible
"It is incredible that this decision - by men - regarding the nature of the God of the Universe was born
in such an environment, but it was. With the seeds of the trinity cultivated at Nicaea, it took many years for
this doctrine to become deeply ingrained in Catholic thought. Eventually it took hold and has stayed firmly in
place. In fact, none of the Protestant sects that separated during the 1500s ever questioned its validity. It had
become blindly accepted, despite its completely non-biblical origins."
"In regards to the trinity, there is a distinct difference between the beliefs of the original first-century Church,
as led by the apostles, and the church that developed later, as influenced by Greek philosophy and other schools
of thought. Although historical evidence of this transition was deliberately shaded (and hidden), sufficient
details remain to confirm what actually happened."

"The philosophy of men appealed to the intellectual vanity of theologians who were Christian in name
only. The leading contributors to trinitarian thought were devoted to Platonism and other shades of human
wisdom. They considered the Bible as of secondary importance, interpreting Scripture as allegories revealing
philosophical principles they saw as infinitely more profound than God’s inspired Word. The faithful who
upheld Scriptural authority were labeled “Judaizers” and were persecuted and killed."
The "Trinity" Doctrine Enforced by Torture and Death
"The faithful who upheld Scriptural authority (over and above the pagan trinity compromise) were
labeled “Judaizers” and were persecuted and killed." As Catholic influence spread in the middle ages across
Europe and beyond, great numbers of people from many regions were forced to acknowledge acceptance of the
trinity under pain of death. They spread the trinity doctrine by the edge of the sword, with infidels (heretics)
routinely being slashed to death. This enforcement and submission was by the point of the sword, where
Christian infidels were generally pierced to death.
"While not the central purpose of this book, it should be noted that the history of the trinity is indeed
one of blood, murder and vicious savagery. It is a history of intolerance and condemnation—of totally blind
allegiance and conviction. Thousands who have lost their lives fighting for the cause of the trinity worshipped
it in ignorance—never having been able to understand, let alone explain, it. Nevertheless, the trinity has
survived as part of the trappings of a religious system that has sought to redefine God. To this end, this system
and her wayward daughters have succeeded. But there is more—much more—to consider!"

During one of my trips to China in Shandong province I came across a very
interesting site. Standing in the center of the city Weihei was a statue of a
Madonna/child. Much to my amazement
the child had a serpents tail and not feet
like a normal child.
I questioned extensively a
historian of the area as to why this statue
was in the midst of a Chinese Province
with no apparent inscription. I was told
only that it was a symbol of their ancient
