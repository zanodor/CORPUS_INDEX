Hūṇa (हूण ).—A tribe. There are a number of references in the Purāṇas to the Hūṇas, who were created from the froth in the mouth of Nandinī, the cow which was in Vasiṣṭha’s āśrama. (Ādi Parva, Chapter 174, Verse 18).
Among the tribes of the north are the Mlecchas, and the Kruras, O best of the Bharatas; the Yavanas, the Chinas, the Kamvojas, the Darunas, and many Mleccha tribes; the Sukritvahas, the Kulatthas, the Hunas, and the Parasikas; the Ramanas, and the Dasamalikas.(MB 6.9.506)
Origin of Hunas with sage Vasishta. Viswamitra attacked the cow of Vasishta. Then many armies emerged for the protection of that cow and they attacked the armies of Viswamitra. Thus this war was fought with the tribes allied with Vasishta for their own land. And from the froth of the cow’s mouth came out hosts of Paundras and Kiratas, Yavanas and Sinhalas, and the barbarous tribesof Khasas and Chivukas and Pulindas and Chinas
and Hunas with Keralas, and numerous other Mlechchhas
(Mbh.1.176.9041)
Nakula conquered the Hūṇas in the western regions. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 32). The Hūṇa kings took part in the Rājasūya of Yudhiṣṭhira and made costly presents. (Sabhā Parva, Chapter 51, Verse 24)...Hūṇa (हूण ) is a name mentioned in the Mahābhārata (cf. II.47.19, VI.10.64) and represents one of the many proper names used for people and places. Note: The Mahābhārata (mentioning Hūṇa) is a Sanskrit epic poem consisting of 100,000 ślokas (metrical verses) and is over 2000 years old...Hūṇa (हूण ) is the name of a kingdom that was conquered by Udayana (king of Vatsa) during his campaign to obtain sovereignty over the whole earth, according to the Kathāsaritsāgara, chapter 19. Accordingly, “His glory, after he had inflicted a defeat on the Hūṇas, made the four quarters resound, and poured down the Himālaya like a second Ganges”.
The Kathāsaritsāgara (‘ocean of streams of story’), mentioning Hūṇa, is a famous Sanskrit epic story revolving around prince Naravāhanadatta and his quest to become the emperor of the vidyādharas (celestial beings). The work is said to have been an adaptation of Guṇāḍhya’s Bṛhatkathā consisting of 100,000 verses, which in turn is part of a larger work containing 700,000 verses.Hūṇa refers to an ancient district or cultural territory, as mentioned in the 7th-century Mudrārākṣasa written by Viśākhadeva. Hūṇa corresponds to a western or northern region...1) Hūna (हून ) refers to a sub-division of the Mlecchas: one of the two-fold division of men born in Mānuṣottara and in the Antaradvīpas, situated in the “middle world” (madhyaloka), according to chapter 2.3 [ajitanātha-caritra] of Hemacandra’s 11th century Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra (“lives of the 63 illustrious persons”): a Sanskrit epic poem narrating the history and legends of sixty-three important persons in Jainism.

Accordingly:—“In these 35 zones on this side of Mānuṣottara and in the Antaradvīpas, men arise by birth; on the mountains, Meru, etc., by kidnapping and power of learning, in the 21⁄2 continents and in 2 oceans. [...]. From the division into Āryas and Mlecchas they are twofold. [...] The Mlecchas—[e.g., the Hūnas, ...] and other non-Āryas also are people who do not know even the word ‘dharma’”.
2) Hūna (हून ) is the name of an ancient kingdom, according to chapter 4.2 [vāsupūjyacaritra].—Accordingly, as Vasupūjya and Jayā spoke to Vāsupūjya:—“All the existing kings, among men and the Vidyādharas, who are of good family, capable, heroic, wealthy, famous, possessing the fourfold army, known for guarding their subjects, free from blemish, faithful to engagements, always devoted to dharma, in Madhyadeśa, Vatsadeśa, [...] and also [... the Hūṇas, ...] and other realms in the north. [...] These now, son, beg us constantly through messengers, who are sent bearing valuable gifts, to give their daughters to you. [...]”.(archive.org: Trisastisalakapurusacaritra)

Huna Shahi Kings and Patola Shahi Kings (275 BCE to 340 CE).—Hunas were the original inhabitants of North-western India since pre-Mahabharata era. It appears that the Hunas were the vassals of the Kushano-Sasanian kings and had only the title of “Shahi” (King) and not “Shahanushahi”(King of Kings). Most probably, the Hunas had taken over the kingdom of north-western India after the fall of Kushano-Sasanian empire. They also invaded north India for the first time during the reign of Kumaragupta (241-199 BCE). Huna King Toramana Shahi reigned around 190-160 BCE and his son Mihirakula reigned around 160-130 BCE.Hunas and Harahunas were Indian tribes of North-western region.—Hunas are mentioned as “Mlecchas” in Mahabharata and Purana. Mahabharata also refers to another trine called “Harahuna”. Sabha parva records that Nakula subdued Hunas, Harahunas, Chinas, Sakas, Ramathas etc. in the west. Hunas were dominating in the west during the lifetime of Kalidasa. It is possible that Kalidasa mistakenly speculated them to be Hunas whom King Raghu subdued. In all probability, Hunas were a clan of Kambojas because the Huna King Toramana calls himself “Shahi” in his coins.

It was one of the ancient mints for Indian dynasties as evidenced by the diverse coins excavated here. The site has 5th and 6th-century Gupta era temples and monuments, particularly the colossal stone boar with sages and scholars depicted on the body of the sculpture. The inscription stones found at Eran are important to reconstructing the chronology of Gupta Empire history. Eran or Erakina was the capital of Erakina (Airikina) Pradesha or Airkina Vishaya, an administrative division of the Gupta empire...The ancient name of Eran (Sanskrit: ऐरण), Erakaina, Erakanya or Erakina (as mentioned in the
inscriptions); Airikina (Sanskrit ऐररकिण, as mentioned in the inscription of Samudragupta) or Erikina (as mentioned in the inscription of Toramana) is derived from Eraka. The word erakā probably refers to a tall grass commonly called the Elephant cattail, botanical name Typha elephantina, which grows at Eran in abundance....The Eran boar inscription of

Toramana is a stone inscription with 8 lines of Sanskrit, first three of which are in meter and rest in prose, written in a North Indian script. It is carved on the chest of a freestanding 11 feet (3.4 m) high red sandstone boar statue, a zoomorphic iconography of Vishnu avatar, and dated to the 6th century. The inscription names king Toramana, a King of the Alchon Huns, as ruling over Malwa ("governing the earth") and records that a Dhanyavishnu is dedicating a stone temple to Narayana (Vishnu). (A. Cunningham (1880), Report of Tours in Bundelkhand and Malwa, Archaeological Survey of India, Volume 10, Calcutta, pages 8485). https://archive.org/details/reporttoursinbu01cunngoog/page/n99/mode/2up?view=theater &q=eran

Portrait of Alchon king Khingila (c.450 CE), and the bull/ lunar tamga of the Alchon (known as Tamgha S1), as visible on Alchon coinage.
"The Alchon Huns, also known as
the Alchono, Alxon, Alkhon, Alkhan, Alakhana and Walxon, were a nomadic people who established states in Central Asia and South Asia during the 4th and 6th centuries CE. They were first mentioned as being located in Paropamisus, and later expanded south-east, into the Punjab and central India, as far as Eran and Kausambi. The Alchon invasion of the Indian subcontinent eradicated the Kidarite Huns who had preceded them by about a century, and contributed to the fall of the Gupta Empire, in a sense bringing an end to Classical India.

The invasion of India by the Huna peoples follows invasions of the subcontinent in the preceding centuries by the Yavana (Indo-Greeks), the Saka (Indo-Scythians), the Palava (Indo-Parthians), and the Kushana (Yuezhi). The Alchon Empire was the third of four major Huna states established in Central and South Asia. The Alchon were preceded by the Kidarites and succeeded by the Hephthalites in Bactria and the Nezak Huns in the Hindu Kush. The names of the Alchon kings are known from their extensive coinage, Buddhist accounts, and a number of commemorative inscriptions throughout the Indian subcontinent.
The Alchons have long been considered as a part or a sub-division of the Hephthalites, or as their eastern branch, but now tend to be considered as a separate entity." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchon_Huns

This issue has traditionally been attributed to a ruler named Prakasaditya, who has been placed with the Guptas. While the types have parallels to certain Gupta issues, the shape of the horseman’s head and the type of headdress he wears have a clear affinity with issues of the Alkhon Huns. This had led to a debate among scholars, with a minority advocating that it was actually a Hunnic issue. Compounding the problem is the fact that the most accessible of these coins have been struck on compact flans, obscuring most of the letters of the name in the obverse legend. Recently, though, this debate came to a conclusion with Pankaj Tandon’s discovery of a coin in a provincial museum in India with the full obverse legend visible. This coin clearly showed that the issuer was the Hunnic king Toramana, and the word Prakasaditya is an epithet for him. https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=301345

The image is the famous Eran varAha from the reign of the lord dhanyaviShNu the brother of king mAtR^iviShNu who appear to have been feudatories of the hUNa king toramANa, as he is named as mahArAjAdhirAja in inscription on the neck of varAha. The date of the installation has been placed between 500-515 CE but at we shall see the garland specifies it reasonable& originally probably precisely. As some people noted, there is the rAshI vR^ishchika (Scorpius) vR^ishchika is the only rAshI depicted on the garland. So, we can rule out the intention of depicting all 12 of them but only specifically depicting 1 for a reason. We take this to indicate the solar month during which the installation was made. That would correspond to November in the common era civil calendar. Where is the vaidika tradition the nakShatra-s were named with different genders, they were seen as the daughters of prajApati and the wives of soma. Hence, they are all taken to be female. There are 18 surviving female figures and we take these to be unoccupied nakShatra-s and the remaining 8/9 with male figures as those which have a graha in them. As aside the tale of the 27 nakShatra-s are the wives of soma first comes in the maitrAyaNIya saMhitA of the kR^iShNayajurveda.



13
Interesting the v1 lords like dhanyaviShNu, mAtR^iviShNu, hariviShNu, varuNviShNu and indraviShNu of Eran were maitrAyaNIya-s. When we look just below the the dhanyaviShNu inscription (orange). We see 7 planetary archons (blue) among the multitude of v1s (perhaps reflecting the belief that they merge with the stars on the cosmic body of viShNu). Of the archons the first is sUrya wearing his characteristic Iranian dress & holding two sun flowers as ordained in the scriptures. Two the right of the 7 archons there is 1/2 figure that probably represents rAhu and ketu. Above them is the puruSha nArAyaNa representing viShNu in his characteristic form as the world axis. Below we find two nakShatra circles with male figures. It our interpretation is right and these are the nakShatra-s occupied by planets when the sun was in vR^iShchika. Then it would ~ around 501 CE
Note the dhanyaviShNu inscription talks of a certain 10th of phAlguna which would be in spring rather than Nov. We believe that the inscription was installed at a date distinct from the sthApana that is indicated by the Scorpius symbol.

Eram – A Lost Monumental Legacy
Introduction – Eran (ऐरण), a small village, is situated at the south bank of river Bina, a tributary of river Betwa. Eran enjoys the status being one among the most ancient towns in India. In ancient times, the town was known as Airikina, Erakaina and Erakanya as evident from the epigraphs and coins discovered here. Eran was an important stop on an ancient route from the east towards Ujjain and from the north linking Mathura and Vidhisa19.
Alexander Cunningham was the first to notice the antiquities of the town and his account was published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal vol. clxxxi m 1847. He again visited the town during his tour in 1871-72 and this account was included in the seventh volume of his survey reports. He narrates a local legend, that assigns the foundation of the town to Raja Barat or Vairat. Bheem, a Pandava, during his exile came to this town. At the expiration of his terms of exile, he shot an arrow, named Kichak, in joy. This arrow, which was shot at a deer, instead hit the hoof of the cow, splitting that into two. However the cow survived, its wound healed immediately and since then the hoof of all cows became cloven. Witnessing this event, the king came to know the real identinty to the sojourner. Bheem left his gada and his mother’s churning stick and erected his own statue and left the town1. The pillar standing at Eran was known as Bheem Gada, another shorter column as his mother’s churning stick and the status of Vishnu as Bheem Sen among the locals.

On the etymology of the name of the town, Cunningham quotes Wilson stating that ‘Eraka’ is a ‘a sort of grass of emollient and diluent properties’ thus the town may have been named



16
from the prevalence of this particular grass2. Noticing the importance of the town, extensive excavations were carried out by K D Bajpai, under the auspices of University of Sagar, between 1960 and 1965. These excavations revealed various layers of settlement patterns taking back the history of the town to the second millennium BCE. On the basis of stratigraphy, Bajpai3 classified the periods of settlement as below
1. Period I (Chalcolithic) – BCE 2000 – BCE 700 2. Period II A (Early Historical) – BCE 700 – BCE 200 3. Period II B – BCE 200 – 1st century CE 4. Period III – 1st century – 6th century CE 5. Period IV (Late Medieval) – up to 1800 CE
The most important finding of the period I was a mud defense wall and its associated moat. This wall suggests that the residents of the town were confined within the boundary marked by this wall. This wall served two purposes for the residents, first it acted as a defense machinery as the town had the advantage of a natural barrier at its other three sides, being surrounded by river Bina. The second purpose this wall served was in form of a moat which was used accommodate the access water in case of heavy rains, thus saving the town. The wall was 154 feet wide and 21 feet deep4.
Among the other significant findings, a circular lead piece bearing the name of king Indragupta, belonging to period II A is the most important. A hoard of 3,268 punch marked coins is am0ong the most significant finding belonging to Period II B. This hoard and finding of other large number of coins suggests that Eran would have served as a mint during that period. Bajpai5 tells that before the conquest of the Guptas, Eran served as a mint minting coins for the local Naga rulers. Later these mints served the Gupta rulers. One copper coin, bearing the name of king Dharmapala, is counted among the earliest inscribed Indian coins, assigned to third century BCE6. An important finding of Period III is a clay seal depicting Gaja-Lakshmi icon with a Brahmi inscription.

The early history of the town can be satisfactorily traced from the time of the Sakas. Eran witnessed at least two foreign invasions, that of the Sakas and Hephthalite (might be taken synonymous with the Hunas of Sanskrit). During the start of the Christian era till the middle of the fourth century CE, Eran seems to be under the rule of the Sakas and their kshatrapas as evident from a clay seal inscription which mentions Saka kshatrapa Isvaramitra and his son Simhasrisena7. On the basis of paleography, the date of Simhasrisena cannot be taken beyond 350 CE. It was the Gupta king Samudragupta who would have wrestled this territory from the hands of the Sakas as attested by his inscription found at Eran. The Saka king ousted by Samudragupta, in all probability, would be Balavarma8.
Though Samudragupta was successful against the Sakas, however that success was not of a permanent nature. After Samudragupta, his sons and successors, Ramagupta and Chadragupta II, continued their battle against the Sakas. Finally, it was Chandragupta II Vikramaditya who is credited as the exterminator of the Sakas, taking the title ‘Sakari’. Ramagupta and Chadragupta II would have spent considerable time at Eran as evident from the variety and volume of their coins found at the site. Bajpai9 suggests that the episode of a Saka king demanding the hand of the wife of Ramagupta, Dhruvadevi, may have happened at Eran as we find inscriptions of the Sakas as well as of the Guptas here. Therefore Eran would be the place where the Sakas were exterminated by the Gupta king Chandragupta II.
Within the Gupta period, Eran was subjected to a foreign invasion once again, and this time it was the Hephthalites (Hunas of Sanskrit) who invaded the town during the waning period of the Gupta authority. An inscription found in Eran mentions Toramana as maharajadhiraja and is dated to his first year of reign. This inscription, on a stone Varaha, refers to the erection of a temple by a Brahman named Dhanyavishnu. The same Brahman is mentioned, along with his brother as the reigning king, in another inscription where the brothers, jointly, erected a Vishnu-pillar, in year 165 of the Gupta era, corresponding 484 CE, referring to the Gupta king Budhagupta. As this pillar inscription does not mention Toramana, therefore it is assumed that Toramana captured Eran after 484 CE, probably around 500 CE10.
However, Toramana enjoyed this possession for a very short period of time. Another inscription at Eran, dated year 191 of the Gupta Era, corresponding 510 CE, mentions the Gupta king Bhanugupta fought a battle though it does not mention with whom this battle was fought. This battle might be fought against the Huna king Toramana either to defend against his invasion or to wrestle back the Gupta territories taken by him. Most probably it might be the case of recapturing the lost territories as from an another inscription the Aulikara king, Prakashadharma, we come to know that he routed Toramana in about 515 CE11.
After the Guptas, the history of the town went into obscurity till the thirteenth century CE when we find many sati stones being erected in the town. More than ten such stones have been reported. Later the town went into the Mughal rule.

1. Stone inscription of Samudragupta – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III written in Sanskrit – undated – This stone inscription was found by Alexander Cunningham near the Varaha temple – The inscription mentions the Gupta king Samudragupta who is compared with Dhanada (Kubera) and Antaka (Yama) in joy and wrath respectively. A mention of setting up a temple of Janardana at Airikina to augment his own glories. 2. Pillar inscription of Budhagupta – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III – written in Sanskrit -dated in year 165 of the Gupta Era (484-85 CE) – The inscription opens with a verse in praise of Vishnu whose ensign is Garuda. Then we are told that when one hundred and sixty five years had elapsed and when Budhagupta was the lord of the earth and when Surasmichandra was a protector of people protecting the province intervening between the Kalindi (Yamuna) and Narmada, this dhvja-stambha of Bhagwan Janardana was caused to be erected by the Maharaja Matrivishnu and his younger brother Dhanyavishnu, son of Harivishnu, grandson of Varunavishnu and above all the great-grandson of Indravishnu, the Brahmana sage, who was the head of the Maitrayaniya school of Yajurveda and performed sacrifices. 3. Inscription on the neck of the boar – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum (Fleet’s edition) Vol III – written in 8 lines in Sanskrit in Brahmi script – dated in the first reign of Toramana – The object of the inscription is to record the building of the temple in which the present Varaha statue stands, by Dhanyavishnu, the younger brother of the deceased Maharaja Matrivishnu. 4. Stone pillar inscription of Bhanugupta – Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol III written in Sanskrit – dated in year 191 of the Gupta Era (510-11 CE) – This 2.5 feet tall linga was found by Cunningham12 on a high mound named Dana Bir. It was turned into a Shivalinga and was under worship when found – The inscription does not mention any reign of any particular king but mentions a certain Bhanugupta who might be not be sovereign but some king of the Gupta family. The object is nonsectarian and mentions that in company of Bhanugupta, who was a great ruler, his chieftain Goparaja came to Eran and fought a battle with the Maitras, and that Goparaja was killed, and that his wife accompanied him, by cremating herself on his funeral pyre, apparently near the place where the pillar was setup. This is probably the earliest record of Sati tradition. Goparaja is stated as the daughter’s son of the Sarabha king. 5. On the same pillar as no 2 – this another inscription on the same pillar refers to the Saka prince, Sridharavarman. His commander Satyanaga is said to be a resident of Maharashtra.
6. Inscription on a small varaha statue, now in Sagar University – Descriptive List of
Inscriptions in The Central Provinces and Berar – written in Sanskrit – undated, dated to 5th century CE on paleographic studies – This Nr-Varaha image was found by Cunningham in possession of a local Brahman in Eran who told the former that the image was brought from the location of the Buddhagupta pillar. A short inscription near the pedestal reads two names, Mahesvara-datta and Varaha-datta, apparently two brothers who caused the statue to be made. 7. Circular lead piece13 – script Mauryan Brahmi – inscribed ‘Rano Indagutasa’ 8. Gajalakshmi clay seal14 – script Brahmi – reads ‘Airikine Gomika Visha(ya)’ translating the seal of the officer of Gomika vishaya of Airikina 9. A clay seal14 – Gupta Brahmi characters – read ‘Mahadandanayaka Simhanandi’ translating Simhanandi, a mahadandanayaka

10. Another clay seal14 – Brahmi characters – reads ‘Isvaramitraputrasya rajno Simhasrisenasya’ translating King Simhasrisena, son of king Isvaramitra
Monuments – All the monuments of principal antiquities are located within one complex. There are remains of four-five temples, three main temples standing in single line in north to south direction.
Varaha (courtesy – Universitat Wien, The Countenance of the Other Project)
Varaha Temple – Though once this statue would be inside a small temple however now its stands below an open sky. The Varaha statue at Eran is the most ancient specimen of its kind. Varaha at Ramtek might be slightly earlier than that of Eran, however the one at Ramtek is very simple representation of zoomorphic form and not the ornamented as found in later period. Varaha in its zoomorphic form is known as Yajna Varaha representing the yajna (sacrifice) with its aahutis (offerings) in an animated form.
This varaha image measures about 14 feet in length, 5 feet in width and 11 feet in height15 making it the biggest such statue in India. The Varaha faces west and is ornamented with 1185 figures of sages, arranged in twelve rows, carved all over his body including legs, neck, forehead and throat16.
Varaha (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
Let us have a look on various figures found on this Varaha. A figure of Bhudevi is shown hanging with the right tusk of Varaha. A female figure, her hands on her waist, is standing in sambhanga posture at the snout of the Varaha. Rangarajan identifies her with Sarasvati while



20
Becker17 identifies her with Vac, goddess of speech. I would be going with Sarasvati as we find the Sarasvati images on the snouts of the Varahas at Khajuraho and Dudhai.
Varaha with a garland of Hindu zodiac signs
In the ears are found Vidhyadharas. A garland of twenty-eight circles is shown around the neck of the Varaha. A male and a female figure is present inside the twenty-seven circles, while one circle has a figure of a scorpion. Rangarajan suggests that these twenty-seven circles represent the those number of Hindu Zodiac signs, while the scorpion figure suggests that the figure of Varaha was installed during Vrschik Rashi period, which is an auspicious time for such activities.
Four rows of male figures are shown across the throat and chest area. There are total of ninety-six figures, except the one, all are two-armed sages holding a water pot in one hand. Between the first and the second row, from top, in middle is an image of Vishnu, who is shown standing on a lotus. He is shown with two hands, but both hands are broken. Rangarajan suggests that he might be holding a gada (club) and chakra (discus). This is also the opinion of Becker.



21
Varaha chest with seven planets including Surya
The third row on the chest shows seven male figures, the leftmost holding two lotus in his hand and wearing a tunic while the rest holding a water vessel. These are identified with the Saptagrhas (seven plantes) by Joanna Williams17. Stephen Merkel17 mentions that these Saptagrahas are the earliest representation of the seven planets. Rahu and Ketu are excluded



22
here as the early texts mentions only the seven planets. The tunic Surya is shown wearing suggests the foreign influence as also attested by the fact that the statue was installed during the rule of Toramana.
On the shoulders of the Varaha is a stump like protrusion which has four niches on its four sides. Rangarajan identifies the figures in the niches with Saumya Purusa (Vasudeva) on the west, Shiva on the south, Brahma on the north and Vishnu on the east. She quotes Ahirbudhnya Samhita, where these four figures are identified with four vyuhas of the supreme being, namely, Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradhyumna and Aniruddha. Joanna Williams17 suggests that this mound or stump on the Varaha’s back is a manifestation of Brahma and it might also represents a yupa or sacrificial post.
Sages of Janaloka on Varaha body
Twelve rows of figures, in shape of a U, are carved along the body of the Varaha. All the twelve rows have figures of two- armed sages, holding water vessel in one hand and one hand

either in abhaya-mudra or in vismaya-mudra. Legs and tail of the Varaha is also decorated with rows of sages, six rows in forelegs and three rows in hind legs. Rangarajan is of opinion that these various sages, arranged in different rows in different parts of Varaha, represents that sages of Janaloka, who witnessed the episode of Varaha rescuing Bhudevi from the depths of an ocean.
Becker points to the erection of this image during the rule of the Huna king Toramana. She digs deeper into the idea and the reason erecting a Vaishnavite symbol or image in the reign of a foreign ruler. Installing a Vaishnavite image, which may be taken as an association to the previous Gupta rulers, might have brought wrath from the new Huna rulers. Though Hunas are known as barbaric and tyrant tribe, Becker tells that Toramana appears to be somewhat a tolerant ruler.
Becker quotes Thakur who mentions that Toramana, a shrewd statesman and foresighted administrator tolerated various religions of his subjects in order to maintain his authority as ruler. Becker tells that the Sassanians used boar as a symbol of royal authority however she also tells that the Sassanian boar imagery cannot be linked to Toramana directly or to the style of the Eran boar except the suggestion that boar was used as a royal symbol during the fifth and sixth century CE in the west and central Asia.
The two points which come to my mind are, how the donor of this statue got aware that boar could also be used as a royal symbol for the new ruler. And second is whether Toramana did not get the reading of the inscription which eulogized Narayana, a Hindu god. I believe that theory that Toramana allow some religious freedom to his subjects is more favorable here rather than Dhanyavishnu, the donor of the statue, getting an idea of using boar as Varaha as well as the royal symbol of Toramana.

Vishnu Pillar
Vishnu Pillar – This dhvaja-stambha erected in the honor of god Janardana is about 47 feet high, resting on a pedestal of 13 feet square. It was known locally as Bhim Gada as told by Cunningham.The shaft is square at bottom and turns octagonal till the capital. Two lions, seated back to back, are carved on the abacus of the capital.

Garuda Capital (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
The capital of the pillar is made of two human images, standing back to back with a wheel in between, one facing east and other west. Cunningham tells that these figures were locally known as that of Rama and Lakshmana. Both the images represent Garuda. The one, facing east, shows Gardua holding a serpent in his hands which Bajpai18 takes as a representation of a crushing defeat of the Sakas under the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II. As Garuda is associated with serpents, as an enemy, it is not surprising to see him holding a serpent. Whether there is any political agenda behind this posture of course is a matter of conjecture.

Garuda capital of Vishnu pillar
As per an inscription, this pillar was erected by brothers Matrivishnu and Dhanyavishnu during the rule of the Gupta king Buddhagupta. Matrivishnu was referred as a king which suggests that he was ruling under the patronage of the Gupta emperors.

Narasimha Image (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
Narasimha Temple – This temple was probably only consisted of a sanctum and mandapa, former 12.5 feet long and about 9 feet wide as Cunningham mentiuons. Now only a damaged statue of Narasimha is what remains of this temple. It is broken below its knees, however its pedestal was in it situ when Cunningham visited. Now the pedestal is also lying on the platform. The pedestal has the remain of feet of Narasimha.
Narasimha
It would have been a 7 feet high statue in its original glory. The iconography is interesting as such this is a kevala-Narasimha image, shown standing but not in action. The mouth wide open shows an amiable appearance rather than the rudra aspect as witnessed in other icons.

Vishnu Temple (courtesy – travellingslacker.com)
Vishnu Temple – This is the best preserved temple at the site. Though its roof is fallen however its sanctum doorway is intact with its decoration. Cunningham suggests that, when complete, it would have measured 32.5 feet long and 13.5 feet wide while its interior dimensions would be 18 feet by 6 feet. Two pillars, 13 feet high, still standing in front of the sanctum suggests that a roofed mandapa adorned the temple. Only the pillars have survived, the walls between are all fallen.

An image of Vishnu, 13 feet high, is placed inside the sanctum. This image was known as an image of Bhim Sen by the locals as mentioned by Cunningham. The sanctum doorway has river goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna, at the door jambs. Usually these river goddess are found at the upper part of the door jambs, at the terminals, in the Gupta period temples. Krishna Deva20 seems to agree here stating that the sanctum doorway and the front mandapa



32
was installed during the Pratihara period of 8th-9th century CE. Dvarpalas are present at the pilasters on either side of the door.
Food and Accommodation – Eran is a small village, you will not find any place to stay and eat. Mandi Bamora is the nearest big town, however that also does not offer good staying options. Best would be that you stay at Sanchi and visit Eran as a day trip from there. Mandi Bamora railway station and nearby area gives some options for food.
How to reach – Mandi Bamora is a railway station on Bhopal-Bina railway line. Eran is about 15 km far from here on eastern side. You can either ask some auto rickshaw or take lift from people going towards that village. There is no direct bus to Eran, buses going to Khurai will drop you at the crossing to Eran, from where it is about 5 kms.

https://puratattva.in/2011/07/14/eran-a-lost-monumental-legacy-2-163 [quote] The Eran boar inscription of Toramana, is a stone inscription found in Eran in the Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is 8 lines of Sanskrit, the first three of which are in meter and the rest in prose, written in a North Indian script. It is carved on the neck of a freestanding 11 feet (3.4 m) high red sandstone Varaha statue, a zoomorphic iconography of Vishnu avatar, and dated to the 6th century. The inscription names king Toramana, ruler of the Alchon Huns, as ruling over Malwa ("governing the earth") and records that a Dhanyavishnu is dedicating a stone temple to Narayana (Vishnu).
The inscription does not give any date, but mentions Toramana is "governing the earth", which is interpreted to mean the Malwa region site where this inscription is found. According to Radhakumud Mookerji, this means that the inscription was made after 510 CE when the Gupta king Bhanugupta and his local chief Goparaja had lost Malwa region after Toramana's invasion. It must be before 513 CE, because Toramana died in Varanasi while on his campaign to conquer eastern India.
The inscription was made by a Vishnu devotee named Dhanyavishnu, the younger brother of the deceased Maharaja Matrivishnu, who is the same person who also erected a pillar in Eran. John Fleet calls it an inscription belonging to 6th-century Vaishnavism, a tradition of Hinduism.
The inscription is written under the neck of the boar, in 8 lines of Sanskrit in the Brahmi script. The boar represents the God Varaha, an avatar of Vishnu. The inscription was found in 1838 by T.S. Burt, who brought it to the attention of James Prinsep. It was published in 1838 by Prinsep with a translation.[3] In 1861, FitzEdward Hall disagreed with Prinsep's report and



34
published a revised edition of the inscription and a new translation. Fleet published his own translation and interpretation of the inscription in 1888. The translations for the inscription vary significantly, though the central theme is similar.
The region around the inscription, the boar sculpture's wall is covered with reliefs, predominantly of rishis (sages) and saints of Hinduism. This iconography follows the Hindu texts where the boar avatar is symbolically shown to be protective of the saints and scholars. Goddess earth (Bhudevi, Prithivi) is depicted with a woman sculpture hanging on to the right tusk of the boar.On the shoulder of the boar is a small shrine. The boar along with the site is damaged, and cracks run across the boar, one of the cracks passes through the inscription.[3]
The John Fleet translation of the inscription reads: {{quote| "Om ! Victorious is the god (Vishnu), who has the form of a Boar; who, in the act of lifting up the earth {out of the waters}, caused the mountains to tremble with the blows of {his} hard snout ; {and) who is the pillar {for the support) of the great house which is the three worlds !
(Line 1 .)— In the first year; while the Maharajadhiraja, the glorious Toramana of great fame {and} of great luster, is governing the earth.
(L. 2 .)— On the tenth day of (the month) Phalguna, — on this {lunar day}, {specified} as above by the regnal year and month and day, {and} invested as above with its own characteristics.
(L. 3 .)— By Dhanyayishnu,— the younger brother, obedient to him {and} accepted with favour by him, of the Maharaja Matrivishnu, who has gone to heaven; who was excessively devoted to the Divine One; who, by the will of (the god) Vidhatri, was approached {in marriage-choice} by the goddess of sovereignty , as if by a maiden choosing (him) of her own accord {to be her husband} ; whose fame extended up to the border of the four oceans; who was possessed of unimpaired honour and wealth ; {and} who was victorious in battle against many enemies; who was the son of the son’s son of Indravishnu; who was attentive to his duties; who celebrated sacrifices; who practiced private study {of the scriptures}; who was a Brahman saint; {and) who was the most excellent {of the followers} of the Maitrayaniya {sakha} who was the son’s son of Varunavishnu, who imitated the virtuous qualities of {his} father;— and who was the son of Harivishnu, who' was the counterpart of {his} father in meritorious qualities, {and} was the cause of the advancement of his race
(L. 6.)— (By this Dhanyavishnu) accomplishing, in unison with {the previously expressed wishes of} him, a joint deed of religious merit, for the sake of increasing the religious merit of (his) parents, this stone temple of the divine (god) Narayana, who has the form of a Boar {and} who is entirely devoted to {the welfare of} the universe, has been caused to be made in this his own vishaya of Airikina.
(L. 8.)— Let prosperity attend all the subjects, headed by the cows and the Brahmans! |Eran boar inscription, Translator: Fleet

Triumphant is the God who, in the likeness of a Boar, lifted up the earth; who, by blows of his hard snout, tossed the mountains aloft; the upholding pillar of that vast mansion, the threefold world.
In the first year that the auspicious Toramana, sovereign of great kings, of extended fame and wide-spread effulgence, is governing the earth; on the tenth day of Phalguna; even so, in the year and month and on the day of his reign before mentioned, during the first watch of the said lunar day
