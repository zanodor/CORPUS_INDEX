SBr. 6.8.SECOND BRÂHMANA.
6:8:2:11. Now, then, as to the taking down of the ashes (to the water 1). Now, the gods at that time threw out the ashes (from the pan). They said, 'If we make this, such as it is, part of our own self, we shall become mortal carcases, not freed from sin; and if we cast it away, we shall put outside of Agni what therein is of Agni's nature: find ye out in what manner we shall do this!'-They said, 'Meditate ye (kit)!' whereby, indeed, they said, 'Seek ye a layer (or altar, kiti). Seek ye in what manner we shall do this!'
6:8:2:22. While meditating, they saw this,--'Let us take it down to the water; for the water is the foundation of this universe: having settled it on that wherein is the foundation of this universe, we shall reproduce from out of the water what there is of Agni's nature in this (heap of ashes).' They then took it down to (and threw it into) the water; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now take it down to the water.

6:8:2:33. [Vâg. S. XII, 35] 'O divine waters, receive ye these ashes, and put them in a soft and fragrant place!'--that, being consumed (matter), has run its course (is useless): regarding that he says, 'Put it in, the most fragrant place!'--'May
p. 294
the wives, wedded to a good lord, bow down to him,'--the wives, doubtless, are the waters, for from the waters this universe is produced; and in Agni the waters have indeed a good lord;--'bear it on the waters, even as a mother (bears) her son!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear her son on her lap, so bear ye this!'
6:8:2:44. [Vâg. S. XII, 36; Rik S. VIII, 43, 9] 'In the waters, O Agni, is thy seat,'--that is, 'in the waters, O Agni, is thy womb; as such thou clingest to the plants,'--for he does indeed cling to (love) the plants,--'being in (their) womb thou art born again,'--when he is in the womb he is indeed born again,--[Vâg. S. XII, 37] 'Thou art the child of the herbs, the child of the trees, the child of all that is, O Agni, thou art the child of the waters;'--he thus makes him (Agni) the child of this entire (universe).
6:8:2:55. With three (verses) he throws (the ashes into the water),--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus throws them down. First with one (prayer), and then with two; or first with two, and then with one,--but at two separate times he throws them down: he thus throws them down by means of the two-footed animals.
6:8:2:66. He then takes some (of the ashes) therefrom: he thereby reproduces from the waters what there is of Agni's nature in that (heap of ashes). [He takes it] with that (nameless or little finger), for with that (finger) medicine is prepared: it is with that one he thus puts him (Agni) together. [Vâg. S. XII, 38-41] 'Having settled 1 in the womb, as
p. 295
ashes, in the waters, and the earth, O Agni,'--by his ashes he is, indeed, settled in the womb, that is, both in the waters and in the earth;--'having united with the mothers, thou hast again, brightly shining, seated thee;'--that is, 'Having joined thy mothers, thou, the shining one, hast again seated thyself (in thy home).'--'Having again seated thee in thy seat, the waters and the earth, O Agni, thou liest in her (the earth, or pan) most happy, as in a mother's lap.'--'Return again with sustenance, again, O Agni, with food and life; guard us again from trouble!--With wealth return, O Agni, overflow with the all-feeding stream on every side!'--that is, 'With all this return thou to me!'
6:8:2:77. With four (verses) he takes (some of the ashes);--he thereby supplies him (Agni) with four-footed animals; and animals being food, it is with food he thus supplies him. With three (verses) he takes (the ashes) down (to the water),--that makes seven, for of seven layers consists the fire-altar 1, seven seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
6:8:2:88. Having taken some of the ashes, and returned, he throws it into the fire-pan, and stands by (the fire) worshipping it; for when he throws Agni into the water he does what is improper; he now makes amends to him so that he may not injure him. With two (verses) relating to Agni (he worships),--for it is to Agni that he makes amends,--and with such
p. 296

as contain (the verb) 'budh' (to attend to, awake), in order that Agni may attend to this speech of his.
6:8:2:99. [Vâg. S. XII, 42-3; Rik S. I, 147, 2; II, 6, 4] 'Attend thou to this word of mine, O youngest!'--that is, 'attend to this word of mine, O youngest!'--'put forth most plentifully, O faithful one!'--that is, 'put forth most abundantly, O faithful one!'--'this one revileth thee, and that one singeth thy praises,'--that is, 'one (man) reviles thee, and another sings thy praises;'-'reverently I revere thy body, O Agni!'--that is, 'I, thy reverer, revere thy body, O Agni!'--'Be thou a munificent patron of offerings, O lord of wealth, the bestower of wealth, keep off from us the haters!' this he says in order that he may keep off haters from him. With two (verses) he worships the fire, a Gâyatrî and a Trishtubh verse: the significance of this has been explained.
6:8:2:1010. These make nine (verses),--there are nine regions 1, and Agni is the regions; nine vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
6:8:2:1111. He then performs two expiations; for it is for (the obtainment of) all his desires that he sets up that (fire);--thus whatever part of his desires is here cut off when the fire is thrown into the water, that he thereby joins together and restores. He performs both expiations which (are performed) when the fire has gone out 2: the significance of this has been explained.
p. 297
6:8:2:1212. This makes ten (performances),--the Virâg consists of ten syllables, and Agni is the Virâg 1; there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
Footnotes
293:1 The ashes removed from the 'ukhâ' or fire-pan are put in a bag made of leaves of some sacred tree, and are then thrown into the water in two portions. As they are floating on the water, a small portion is taken from them again with the little finger and put in the pan.
294:1 'Pra-sad' (= pra-âp, Mahîdhara) seems here really to have the p. 295 meaning of 'abhiprasad' or 'anuprasad,' as the accusative can scarcely be taken along with 'âsadah.'
295:1 See p. 249, note 3.
296:1 Viz. the four cardinal points, and the four intermediate points, of the compass, and the upper region. To these paragraph 12 adds, as a tenth, the lower region.
296:2 VI, 6, 4, 10 seq.
297:1 That is, the wide-shining, or wide-ruling one.

Twenty four is the count of kāru, and nāru village officers:
नारू nārū m A common term for village-personages otherwise named अलुतेदार or अलुते.
नारूकारू nārūkārū m pl A term for certain personages of a village otherwise named
अलुतेिलुते for whom see under अलुता & िलुतेदार. अलुता or त्या alutā or tyā m (A formation
alliteratively from िलुत्या in extension of the application of that word.) A common term for
certain Village officers secondary to the िलुते. Thus िारा अलुते आबण िारा िलुते of whom see the
full list under िलुतेदार.
िलुतेदार or िलुता balutēdāra or balutā or त्या m (िलुतें &38;c.) A public servant of a village
entitled to िलुतें. There are twelve distinct from the regular Governmentofficers पाटील,
कु ळकरणी &38;c.; viz. सुतार, लोिार, मिार, माुंग (These four constitute पबिली or थोरली
कास or वळ the first division. Of three of them each is entitled to चार पाचुुंदे, twenty bundles of
Holcus or the thrashed corn, and the मिार to आठ पाचुुंदे); कुुं भार, चाम्हार , परीट,
न्हावी constitute दुसरी or मधली कास or वळ, and are entitled, each, to तीि पाचुुंदे; भट, मुलाणा, गुरव,
कोळी form बतसरी or धाकटी कास or वळ, and have, each, दोि पाचुुंदे. Likewise there are
twelve अलुते or supernumerary public claimants, viz. तेली, ताुंिोळी, साळी, माळी, जुंगम, कळवाुंत,
डवऱ्या , ठाकर, घडशी, तराळ, सोिार, चौगुला. Of these the allowance of corn is not settled. The
learner must be prepared to meet with other enumerations of the िलुतेदार (e. g. पाटील, कु ळ
करणी, चौधरी, पोतदार, देशपाुंड्या , न्हावी , परीट, गुरव, सुतार, कुुं भार, वेसकर, जोशी; also सुतार, लोिार, चाम्हार , कुुं भार as constituting the first-class and claiming the largest division of िलुतें; next न्हावी ,
परीट, कोळी, गुरव as constituting the middle class and claiming a subdivision of िलुतें; lastly, भट,
मुलाणा, सोिार, माुंग; and, in the Konkan̤ , yet another list); and with other accounts of the assignments of corn; for this and many similar matters, originally determined diversely, have undergone the usual influence of time, place, and ignorance. Of the िलुतेदार in the Indápúr
pergunnah the list and description stands thus:--First class, सुतार, लोिार, चाम्हार , मिार;
Second, परीट, कुुं भार, न्हावी , माुंग; Third, सोिार, मुलाणा, गुरव, जोशी, कोळी, रामोशी; in all fourteen, but in no one village are the whole fourteen to be found or traced. In the Panḍharpúr districts the order is:--पबिली or थोरली वळ (1st class); मिार, सुतार, लोिार, चाम्हार , दुसरी or मधली वळ (2nd class); परीट, कुुं भार, न्हावी , माुंग, बतसरी or धाकटी वळ (3rd class); कु ळकरणी, जोशी, गुरव, पोतदार; twelve िलुतेand of अलुते there are eighteen. According to Grant Duff, the िलतेदार are सुतार,
लोिार, चाम्हार , माुंग, कुुं भार, न्हावी , परीट, गुरव, जोशी, भाट, मुलाणा; and the अलुते are सोिार, जुंगम, बशुंपी, कोळी, तराळ or वेसकर, माळी, डवऱ्यागोसावी , घडशी, रामोशी, तेली, ताुंिोळी, गोुंधळी. In many villages of Northern Dakhan̤ the मिार receives the िलुतें of the first, second, and third classes;
and, consequently, besides the मिार, there are but nine िलुतेदार. The following are the
only अलुतेदार or िारू now to be found;--सोिार, माुंग, बशुंपी, भट गोुंधळी, कोर- गू, कोतवाल, तराळ, but of the अलुतेदार &38; िलुते- दार there is much confused intermixture, the अलुतेदार of one
district being the िलुतेदार of another, and vice versâ . (The word कास used above, in पबिली कास,
मध्यम कास, बतसरी कास requires explanation. It means Udder; and, as the िलुतेदार are, in the



10
phraseology of endearment or fondling, termed वासरें (calves), their allotments or divisions are
figured by successive bodies of calves drawing at the कास or under of the गाुंव under the figure of
a गाय or cow.)
This is a tribute to Smt. Rekha Rao for the brilliant identification of a gmelina arborea shape leaf which matches with the unique shape of an exquisite Harappa faience tablet with Indus Script inscription.
I agree with this identification of the leaf as signifying gmelina arborea. This Kashmiri teak wood is NOT called Kashmira but kumuda read rebus as कु -मुद kumuda, 'silver'

குமிழ்ந்ை் யாதை.Thus, the kumi ̤r, kumuda, gmelina arborea leaf signifies bas-relief writing.
Rebus: कु -मुद 'silver' (Monier-Williams)
Thus, the gmelina arborea leaf shape signifies kumuda 'silver'. With this decipherment, the entier Indus Script inscription on sides of the Harappa tablet is read rebus: khōṇḍa 'leafless tree' rebus: kunda 'fine gold' PLUS kuṭi, 'tree' rebus: kuṭhi 'smelter'
dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metalcasting' PLUS barad, balad 'ox' rebus: bharata n A factitious metal compounded of copper, pewter, tin &c. Thus, the pair of bulls (oxen) signifies: copper-pewtertin-alloy metalcasters.
The text message PLUS 24-dots of a text box read rebus: 24-dot text box as hypertext: dul kāru (2X12) signifies metalcaster artisans (making) dul khaṇḍa 'metalcast equipment'
The four-signs of the text message read from r. to l.

3.kaṇḍa kārṇī which reads ‘rim of jar’ rebus: ‘equipment cargo, scribe’
4. karaḍā खरडें 'daybook, wealth-accounting ledger'. Rebus: kharādī ' turner'.
Thus, the text message trogether with the text-box of 24 dots conveys the details of the wealth cargo: alloy metal, equipment cargo, wealth-accounting ledger of metals turner. silver and alloy metal smelter, PLUS dul kāru (2X12) metalcaster artisans (making) dul khaṇḍa 'metalcast equipment'.
A unique mold-made faience tablet or standard (H2000-4483/2342-01) was found in the eroded levels west of the tablet workshop in Trench 54 of Harappa by HARP Team.
