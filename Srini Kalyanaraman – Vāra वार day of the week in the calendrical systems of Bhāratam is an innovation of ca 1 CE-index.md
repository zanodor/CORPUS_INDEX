Vāra ( ) 'day of the week' in the calendrical systems of
Bhāratam is an innovation of ca. 1 CE
Vāra ( ) 'day of the week'. When did the use of this word with this meaning come into vogue in Bhāratam? Was it in vogue for MBh calendar? The answer is: No, it was not in vogue in the Vedanga Jyotisa calendar of MBh times.

Jayasree Saranathan @jayasartn 31 July 2021 If Kali Yuga date is changed by a single day, today cannot be Saturday. It's a pity this knowledge known to common man until not long ago is not known to current generation. There are 2 India's- one that knows and the other out to destroy this knowledge. https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/03/kali-y
Common parlance is vāsaraḥ ‘a day of the week’. Synonym is used in Jyotistattvam as
a signifier of the vāraḥ -- , ‘a time or period of the day when no act is performed’.
It appears that the word vāraḥ was not used in the calendrical systems of ancient times and may have been brought into vogue, perhaps in the historical periods, say, Gupta reign. I agree with PV Kane that the week as a time-reckoner is an innovation in Bhāratam in the Common Era, say from 1 CE.
“A continuous seven day cycle that runs throughout history, paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon and having a fixed day of rest, was most likely first practised in Judaism, dated to the 6th century BC at the latest.” (Eviatar Zerubavel (March 15, 1989). The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week. University of Chicago Press.)

“Historically, the system of dominical letters (letters A to G identifying the weekday of the first day of a given year) has been used to facilitate calculation of the day of week. The day of the week can be easily calculated given a date's Julian day number (JD, i.e. the integer value at noon UT): Adding one to the remainder after dividing the Julian day number by seven (JD modulo 7 + 1) yields that date's ISO 8601 day of the week. For example, the Julian day number of 30 July 2021 is 2459426. Calculating 2459426 mod 7 + 1 yields 5, corresponding to Friday.” (Richards, E. G. (2013). "Calendars". In S. E. Urban & P. K. Seidelmann,
eds. Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 3rd ed. (pp. 585–624). Mill Valley, Calif.: University Science Books. 2013, pp. 592, 618. This is equivalent to saying that JD0, i.e. 1 January 4713 BC of the proleptic Julian calendar, was a Monday.)... The seven-day week seems to have been adopted, at different stages, by the Persian Empire, in Hellenistic astrology, and (via Greek transmission) in Gupta India and Tang China... The seven-day week was known in India by the 6th century, referenced in the Pañcasiddhāntikā. Shashi (Shashi, Shyam Singh
(2000). Encyclopaedia Indica India, Pakistan, Bangladesh Vol. 76 Major dynasties of ancient Orissa: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. Anmol Publications PVT. LTD. pp. 114–115.) mentions

the Garga Samhita, which he places in the 1st century BC or AD, as a possible earlier reference to a seven-day week in India. He concludes "the above references furnish a terminus ad quem (viz. 1st century) The terminus a quo cannot be stated with certainty".( Pandurang Vaman Kane (1930–1962). History of Dharmaśāstra.)
