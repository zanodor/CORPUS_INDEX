About prehistoric images scratched on two bones found in Neveh Yam and Ha-Gosherim (Israël)
Fig. 1. Bone figurine from Neveh Yam (photograph by E. Galili; drawing by Leonid Ziegler)
This bone figurine is recovered from the Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah culture) site of Neveh Yam, dated to the sixth–fifth millennia BCE.
Neveh Yam on the map
These two maps show the location of the kibbutz Neve Yam.
Neve Yam (Hebrew: נְ וֵה יָם , lit. Sea Oasis) is a kibbutz in northern Israel. Located around twenty kilometres south of Haifa, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof HaCarmel Regional Council. In 2021 it had a population of 237. History: The kibbutz was established in 1939 by members of the Gordonia youth movement, and served as a base for the Palyam. Nearby is a geyser that is activated when the sea is stormy. The kibbutz has fallen into financial difficulties and is attempting a rejuvenation project by attracting twenty-seven families from Elei Sinai, Dugit, and Nisanit, who had been evicted from the northern Gaza Strip as part of the Israel's unilateral disengagement plan of 2005 and allotting them land adjacent to the sea for permanent housing. The new project would give the evictees a housing solution similar to their original homes. The Israel Union for Environmental Defense is struggling to prevent the project, which it deems is too close to the beach.

Fig. 2. Bone figurine from Ha-Gosherim (after Getzov 2011: fig. 10:43a,b)
In this essay I study the bone figurine from Neveh Yam together with this one found in HaGosherim.
HaGoshrim on the map
These two maps depict the location of the kibbutz HaGoshrim:
HaGoshrim (Hebrew: הַ גּוֹשְ ִרים , lit. 'The Bridge Builders') is a kibbutz in the Galilee Panhandle in
northern Israel, 5 km east of Kiryat Shmona. The kibbutz is adjacent to the Hurshat Tal National Park and bisected by tributaries of the Jordan River, the Snir (Hatsbani), Koren, itself a tributary of the Dan and Tal. In 2021 it had a population of 1,010. Archaeology: Excavations at the Neolithic site of Hagoshrim in 2003 yielded a large assemblage of skeletal fragments, mainly of cattle and pigs, providing evidence of the domestication of these taxa in the southern Levant.
(Further information on these two bones can be found in the PDF: Symbolic artifacts from the submerged Neolithic village of Neve-Yam and contemporary Israeli sites as fossil director for the Wadi Rabah culture.)

On the drawings you can see the images scratched on the bones. This essay searches for the meaning of images using the images on cylinder seals that were made much later in the Near East.

Two radiant eyes are scratched at the top of this bone figurine. These are not placed in a face but more or less stand on their own. I therefore assume that these shining eyes symbolize the sun and the moon. It was not at all unusual to see the sun as an eye as we can read in 'The lament for Sumer and Urim':
The lament for Sumer and Urim: c.2.2.3
At the royal station (?) there was no food on top of the platform (?). The king who used to eat marvellous food grabbed at a mere ration. As the day grew dark, the eye of the sun was eclipsing, the people experienced hunger
And in Hindu mythology, the right eye of Shiva is the sun and his left eye is the moon:
Lord Shiva’s Third Eye
by Sunita Shah May 16, 2021 Lord Shiva the god or destruction and regeneration. He is also known as Triambake, which in
Sanskrit means ‘Third Eye’. His right eye is supposed to symbolise the sun, his left eye the moon.

Bone figurine from Neveh Yam Drawing by Leonid Ziegler
If we therefore assume that the two radiant eyes indeed represent the sun and the moon, then we can see that these two eyes on this bone figure more or less overlap. That may be the case at new moon. Sun and moon are close together and sometimes the moon is even completely or partially in front of the sun and there is an eclipse.
This brings me to familiar territory because a lot of AME cylinder seals have a crescent moon, symbolizing new moon, engraved on them. The cuneiform texts show that various activities were carried out during the period of the new moon. I will show this by means of some imprints of a number of cylinder seals.



Number 1
We start with this imprint. According to the inscription, the man on the left is named Ludigira. He is the son of Mash-gula. It's important to know that the bird, depicted in the center of this imprint, symbolizes ‘fate’. From this we may conclude that the sitting god pronounces a 'fate' or a 'destiny of life' on Lu-digira: according to the inscription he must become a smith. The sickle at the top symbolizes that the granting of this destiny of life happens with new moon: in the following text we can read that the gods perfect the divine powers with a new moon, they decree judgments and decide verdicts:
A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan A): c.2.5.3.1
When standing in the heavens she is the good wild cow of An, on earth she instils respect; she is the lady of all the lands. She received the divine powers in the abzu, in Eridug; her father Enki presented them to her. He placed the lordship and kingship in her hands. She takes her seat on the great dais with An; she determines the fates in her Land with Enlil. Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land gather around her so that the divine powers are perfected. The great Anuna gods, having
bowed before them, stand there with prayers and supplications and utter prayers on behalf of all the lands. My lady decrees judgments in due order for the Land. { (2 mss. add the line:) Inana decides verdicts for the Land together with Enlil. } Her black-headed people parade before her.
Number 2
On this imprint we see the singer Ur.Ur under the crescent moon: the owner of the original
seal makes music. In the story 'The building of Ninĝirsu's temple' we read that great rites
and festivals are performed during new moons:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
‘I founded the Tiraš shrine with as much majesty as the abzu. Each month at the new moon the
great rites (?), my ‘Festival of An’, are performed for me perfectly in it.’
And that is the case on this imprint: with the new moon, the gods have a festive gathering where the singer Ur.Ur. makes music.



Bone figurine from Ha-Gosherim After Getzov 2011: fig. 10:43a,b)
On this bone we see the sun and the moon staring at us: various texts state that the gazing of the gods gives life:
Enki and Ninḫursaĝa: c.1.1.1
Ninḫursaĝa cursed the name Enki: ‘Until his dying day, I will never look upon him with life-giving eye.’ The Anuna sat down in the dust. But a fox was able to speak to Enlil: ‘If I bring Ninḫursaĝa to you, what will be my reward?’ Enlil answered the fox: ‘If you bring Ninḫursaĝa to me, I shall erect two birch (?) trees for you in my city and you will be renowned.’
A hymn to Ḫaia for Rīm-Sîn (Rīm-Sîn B): c.2.6.9.2
Leader, leader (?) of the gods, complete the great fates of the people. Look favourably upon the king with your gracious gaze that is full of life. Duly grant a joyous reign of long days to prince Rīm-Sîn, marking its years on the tablet of life, forever unalterable. May An and Enlil love the shepherd Rīm
Sîn in the office of high priest. The singers will make your praise resound sweetly in their mouths; Ḫaia, the singers will make your praise resound sweetly in their mouths. Lord of heaven and earth, king of the abzu, its praise is august. Father Enki, king of the abzu, your praise is sweet.
A praise poem of Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan B): c.2.5.3.2
At Enlil's command, your gaze brings men life, your conversation brings men health. Enlil rejoices in your speech. Ninlil declares ‘so be it’ to your desires. Shepherd Enlil is your support. IddinDagan, who is built like you? People's eyes are directed towards you.
And without any doubt, the gazing of the sun and the moon gives life too.

A triangle is scratched at the bottom of the bone which corresponds to the Sumerian vulva sign.
[1] mug2
1. female genitals, vulva
Akk. bişşūru ’female genitals, vulva’; ūru ’(nakedness, i.e.) pudenda (of man, woman)’.
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
In the first place, a vulva sign obviously symbolizes 'a woman', but in this case it will, however, symbolize 'Mother Earth', on which crops grow and a gazelle walks.
Number 3
Anyway, on this imprint we see that a man and a woman unite with each other. The sickle at the top makes it clear that this act of love is performed at the new moon.
A tigi to Nanaya for Išbi-Erra
O Nanaya, the goddess has created your holy powers ...... for you. You have ...... turned the
favourable eye of life onto the bedchamber, and Išbi-Erra is the youth chosen for his beauty.
As Nanaya turn the favorable eye of life onto the bedchamber, so shall the sun and the moon at new moon turn their eyes of life on the couple that make love.

A gazelle is scratched above the vulva on this piece of bone. It is suggested here that at new moon the sun and the moon with their gazing also gives life to this beautiful quadruped.
Number 4
The same is the case here: at the new moon, the sun and the moon gaze at the mating cows and give these animals new life, as can also be concluded from the following text excerpt:
A šir-namšub to Utu (Utu E): c.4.32.e
60-66. Gaze upon him, gaze upon him! O Utu, gaze upon him, gaze upon him! O wild bull of the E
babbar, gaze upon him, gaze upon him! O bearded one, son born to Ningal, ......, gaze upon him!
When you gaze upon the bulls in the cattle-pen, bulls fill the cattle-pen. When you gaze upon the sheep in the fold, sheep fill the fold. When you have gazed upon the man, .......

A triple grain stalk is scratched under the radiant sun eye and moon eye. This arrangement suggests that the sun and moon multiply the grain stalks with their gazing.
Number 5
On this imprint we see that a farmer is plowing and on the right is a stalk of corn. After plowing, of course, a new crop is sown. The grain stem suggests the harvest. The crescent at the top shows that these two events happen at new moon. This means that the sun and the moon with their gazing gives life to the crop that is sown and to the crop that is harvested.
A balbale (?) to Inana (Dumuzid-Inana P): c.4.08.16
‘These genitals, ......, like a horn, ...... a great waggon, this moored Boat of Heaven ...... of
mine, clothed in beauty like the new crescent moon, this waste land abandoned in the desert
......, this field of ducks where my ducks sit, this high well-watered field of mine: my own
genitals, the maiden's, a well-watered opened-up mound -- who will be their ploughman? My genitals, the lady's, the moist and well-watered ground -- who will put an ox there?’



Number 6
Even the birth of a probable divine child (because of the star sign) took place at the new moon.
Number 7
By the way, I see some resemblance to the temple figurines found in Northern Syria. We see that here the eyes protrude high above the temple, just as the eyes on the two bones protrude above the gazelles, the stalks of wheat and the vulvas

Grids, scratched on this bone, can have different meanings.
Archaic Sumerian Pictographic Signs by Ashur Cherry
u [BED]
u [BED] wr. u2 ’bed’ Akk. Eršu
u2
A grid can symbolize a bed, but I don't think this applies here.

siki

A grid can be a wool, fleece; hair; (animal's) pelt', this does not seem to apply here either.

But a grid can also have other meanings:

kid [MAT]
kid [MAT] (509x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. gikid; kid ’a
reed mat’ Akk. Kītu
kid
It can symbolize a reed mat but I don't think that applies here either.
u [PLANTS]
u [PLANTS] (4129x: ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian, unknown)
wr. u2 ’bread, loaf; food; grass, herb; pasture; plant(s)’ Akk. akalu; rîtu; šammu
See u susu[dine].
u2 http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
At last, a grid can also symbolize 'grass, pasture and plants' and that seems to me to be applicable here. When that is the case, the sun and the moon at new moon give their life to all crops.



Bone figurine from Neveh Yam Drawing by Leonid Ziegler
In the middle of the bone two mountains are scratched and this reminds me of the following text:
A šir-namšub to Utu (Utu F): c.4.32.f
(Inana speaks:) ‘My brother, awe-inspiring lord, let me ride with you to the mountains! Lord of heaven, awe-inspiring lord, lord, let me ride with you to the mountains; to the mountains of herbs, to the mountains of cedars, to the mountains; to the mountains of cedars, the mountains of cypresses, to the mountains; to the mountains of silver, the mountains of lapis lazuli, to the mountains; to the mountains where the gakkul plants grow, to the mountains; to the distant source of the rolling rivers, to the mountains.’ 31-34. "My brother, come, let me ....... My brother, the midst of the sea ...... my eyes. My brother, women ....... Utu, women ......." 35-38. "I am unfamiliar with womanly matters, with ....... I am unfamiliar with womanly matters, with sexual intercourse! I am unfamiliar with womanly matters, with kissing! I am unfamiliar with sexual intercourse, I am unfamiliar with kissing!"
Inanna wants to make love to Utu, the sun god, on the mountains and this will obviously benefit the whole earth.
I'll end this very small essay by dating the two bones.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar
Together the sun and the moon represent Gemini. Besides that the moon god Sin is the presiding deity of this constellation as you can see on the above table. From 6480 to 4320 BC new year started in Gemini and that is why I think that the images were scratched on the two bones about 7000 years ago.

Number 7 Idole Aux Yeux. Grande idole aux yeux, le corps quadrangulaire sculpté sur chaque face de façades de temple entre des registres de chevrons, de croisillons et de losanges. Le long cou tronconique est surmonté de deux grands yeux percés. Chlorite ou stéatite noire. Cassure au sommet des yeux. Proche-Orient, ca. 3000 av. J.-C. H_20,2 cm Les idoles aux yeux seraient la représentation abstraite d'une divinité à une époque où les dieux étaient très rarement montrés avec une apparence humaine. Elles ont été retrouvées dans des sanctuaires et avaient un lien avec les pratiques religieuses ou cultuelles. Les représentations des façades de temples se rencontrent sur de nombreux vases de pierre de la fin du IVe millénaire av. J.-C. Pour un modèle similaire, cf. Christie's, Londres, 7 octobre 2010, n° 69. Bibliographie: C.J. Dury, Art of the Ancient Near East and Middle East, New York, 1970, p. 43.
