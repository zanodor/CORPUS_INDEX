Scythian religious terms
Fred Hámori
Most of the Scythic gods mentioned by Herodotus around 500BC.
have excellent Ural-Altaic, rather than Iranian explanations. Here is
a more detailed list of religious & mythological terms which were
recorded by Herodotus and their Ural-Altaic comparisons.
The main agglutinative languages of Asia today are Finn-Ugor(Uralic),
Altaic (Turkic,Mongol,..) and Dravidian (in India). In the past most
of Iran and the near east also spoke such languages, like Sumerian,
Elamite, Hurri, Urartuan, Hatti, Guti, Lulubi, Kassite..
Their effect on Semitic languages therefore is also evident. These
ancient Mesopotamian agglutinative languages in fact shared a lot
of common vocabulary with the current language families, and
were not isolated and unrelated until they were split due to the
P.I.E. invasion, even though there were naturally some differences
in pronunciation and some changes in the meaning of the root words.
The following list will emphasize the commonly shared basic words
as they relate to Scythian religious terms.

According to Herodotus, they use no images, altars, or temples except
in the worship of Ares the war god. .. whose main symbol is the blood
soaked sword placed on top of a mound. Similarly in 12th century
Hungarian Chronicles, -not invented recently- the custom of the
blood soaked sword, was carried around in times of war calling to arms
all able bodied men. Those not heeding this warning could be tossed
into slavery. Also the custom of burrying swords on top of mountain



top point up continued amongst Transylvanian Hungarians. Blood oaths
were also identical to Scythian and Parthian customs.**
Their burial customs included the burial of the chief with his favorite
horses and often his wife in a burial mound. The horse burial was
common among Sumerians (onager), Scythians, Huns, Turks, Cumans,
Hungarians.

The Buddha was a prince of the Scythian [SAKA] tribe of the Budda.
Herodotus also mentions a "Bud-ini" tribe in Eastern Europe. Budun
can mean "people" in Turkic.
Daughter of Boristen(es)
Herodotus mentioned more than one myth of origin for the Scythians.
One of these claimed the mating of Papaois (Zeus) and the daughter
of "Bor-isten", as the father of Targi-taur-us the father of the
Scythian nations. His sons were supposedly Leip-ox-ais, Arp-ox-ais,
and Col-ax-ais. The "ax" term is U.A. [UK] for clan,family while
"ais" is more common in Turkic [yas] and Hungarian [o"s] as
"ancestor". The root name is therefore Leip, Arp, and Col ..
similar to the the following:
Scyth Mede ................Parthian .........................Hungarian ***
Arp-ox-ais
Arp-ax-ad ..................Ehrp-at ..........................Arp-ad (-ed=diminutive)
Leip-ox-ais ......................................................- Leb-ed=Lev-ed b>v
Col-ax-ais ..................Kal-du -.......................... Kaal,Kal-ti,Gaal
The Targi-taur name is also but a variant of the Tarx-an name, which
were the Parthian "prince" and Turk "nobility" and also the source
of the Hungarian Taryan tribal name. (Etrusk Tarkini-us ??) ***



Another version claimed Heracles and a half serpent (mermaid like)
being as the ancestors of the Scythians. Both have ties with similar
stories among other Ural-Altaic legends. Starting with the serpent
like mother of the Scythians, who in India was called Naga, by the
local Scythian incomers. The NAK suffix and root word also has a
very rich set of meanings in the Ugrian languages, including
( 4, feminine, joint-vertabra, genetive - source, navel, rule of
important person.)
To a lesser extent the root word is part of most U.A. and Sumerian
languages. Several of the local Scythian tribes use this word for
chief/ruler "Naick". Similarly the Ugrians Nay=queen, Nayer=king.
Hungarian Nyek tribe. (Scythian NAICK-erde tribe next to the Aral
Sea.)
BOR-isten
The term Bori, Buri, Pur is an ancient term referring to a totemic
ancestor of many Ural-Altaic nations. Seen on the pertoglyps of
the Altai and Sayan. Now due to its animal - totemic nature, the
animal may be different even though its totemic name is the same,
for it represents the "ancestor spirit". Among some, the *"horned"
deer is the ancestor like Hungarians and some Scythians.
In time some of the characteristics of the stagg totem were
transferred over to the horse, which was on ceremonial occasions
decorated with antlers. The Persian story of Rustvanshad (of
eastern, non Iranian origin) reflects the close analogy with the
Hungarian legend and even calls the queen "sar-istani"=doe-goddes.
Some Hun tribes also had a hind totem as is illustrated in stone
engravings from Mongolia and frescoes from Dung-Huan.
Also European references to their myths. The Greek goddes Artemis
which is just the borrowed form of the Scythian Artimpaz, is
also symbolized with the horned-doe, indicating her identity
with the Scythian totemic mothergoddess. These symbols can be
traced from Luristan, to the Scythians, and Huns over a very



wide area of Asia rather than from I.E. terrytories to them.
There is even a Japanese legend of the ancestors hunting a
magical stagg, who in the process find the island of Japan.
A few references from Gyula Laszlo's "Regeszeti Tanulmanyok"
illustrate the BUR, PUR, BUW name with examples.
BUR-kan =god in Teleut, Sor, Sagaj, Kachinco, Koibal, Kara-gas,
Soyot. "PUR" =the son of the chief god Ulgen, among the Teleut.
He is the ancestor of man. The Urjanchai shaman calls the ancestor
spirit, the horned-doe, as my "grandmother". The Kirghiz call
their ancestress "Bu-gu", who is imagined as a horned woman.
Some tribal names which derive from the horned ancestress/ancestor
are the Ujgur Buga-syr clan, Kirghiz Bur-lak (bull), Bur-das.
Among the Ugrians PARI-aske, I believe is the name of Noah, the
ancestor of man. This again is Christianized from the original.
The Hungarian word for people/man em-BER is probably related.
A Hungarian balad of the stagg also shows the heavenly association
as the mother not just of man, but the cosmos. It has been slightly
Christianized over a millenia.
"Wonderous headed hind, with horns of thousand branches and knobs
Thousand branches and knobs (shining like) a thousand candles
Amongst its horns it carries the light of the blessed sun
On its forehead a star, on its chest the moon
It starts on the banks of the heavenly Danube (Milky Way/river)
That it may be the messenger of heaven and bringer of good news
About our creator and caring god."
According to the Byzanteen historian, Procopius.
"The nation of the Uti-gurs and Kuti-gur Huns originate from the
twin sons of a Hun king. The twins separated from their father
during the hunting of a stagg. .. These same Huns also had two
princes called Mauger and Gorda, who ruled after their father's
death." Much like parts of the Hungarian legends Hunor & Magor.
A Greek legend of the origin of the Anatolian Megari claims that
Zeus maries a Scythian nymph and their childred are the source of



this nation. In another variation the sons of Zeus and Nemesis,
are known as the Gemini twins. According to Greek tradition even
Zeus originates from the east. The pre-Vedic Gathas also call
the constellation Capricorn by the name Makar, while Gemini is
Mit-huna. Much like the Hunor and Magor twins of Hungarians
dealing with the mythical stagg. Similarly the Sumerian god
ENKI is also known as Daramah the "great stagg", whose other
symbol is the fish, the combination of the two is Capricorn.
Many of the Hun and Turkic tribes had the wolf and various dog
breeds as the totem animals and in Turkic languages bo"ru" refers
to wolf. Herodotus also mentions the Scythian NEURI, who "turn
into wolves once per year.. as a ceremony no doubt. This tribal
name is much like the Hurrian NAIRI tribal name. The royal tribes
of the Huns had the dragon (LIU-ente dynasty) as their totem like
the Medes and royal Scythians. It would only be natural for the
royal Scythians to have the half serpent half woman being to be
their ancestress with the type of legend Herodotus related about
the mating of Zeus with such a mythical "mermaid", which Herodotus
calles the daughter of Bor-isten(es).
bor-ISTEN
Isten in Hittite and Hattic was a sun god while in Parthian and
Hungarian it is God, (Is=Os=ancestor). A Parthian temple to their
mother goddess Nana in the city of Nisa included an inscription
on its walls of the following phrase N.N.Y.S.T.N. ="Nana Isten".
Ysten in the ancient Yzdanite religion of Iran, was the uncreated,
eternal, nonmaterial creator of all, the ONE-god=universal.
Their sacred book the DAB-ISTAN was supposedly handed
down from the time of the pre-Iranian Peshdadian monarchs and
translated to Iranian. **
