Life and Consciousness: Metaphors of Indus Script
hieroglyphs and Naṭarāja. Is चित् cit, 'consciousness'
अप-स्मार , 'epilepsy' computable?
Some definitions of terms: Life, Consciousness, Information, Cognitive Science
Life
Life exists in various animate forms: e.g., plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, bacteria. Animate forms have a life-cycle of biological processes adapting to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. When biological processes terminate, death occurs.
Consciousness
An intuition or introspection or private thought of any living form is that consciousness exists. Sense-impressions like visual perceptions or bodily pains are manifestations of consciousness.
Consciousness is a sub-set of life. Consciousness is the ability to experience.
Information
This can be further elaborated as the ability to directly know and perceive, to feel, or to be cognizant of events. To directly know is to be aware of some information. The consequence of such awareness results in the direction of a wide range of behavioral action. Biological actions are computed responses of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs. whether internal or external, These stimuli or inputs constitute information.
Cognitive Science
Cognitive Science is a study of how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information.
This monograph analyses the contours of consciousness from two metaphors: 1. Indus Script hieroglyphs and 2. Cosmic dance of Naṭarāja.
Metaphor of Indus Script hieroglyphs
HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol was invented in Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization to create (Artificial Intelligence) Indus Script hypertexts using, combining hieroglyphs. This hypertext composition as a Cipher is an indicator of चित् cit, 'consciousness' as an operational process of the scribe in creating a visual language based on his or her personal experience of recording sensory, principally visual, perceptions.

Thus, the hypertext reads the hieroglyph components which signify: smelter, factory; iron, alloy metal; supercargo, scribe; quantity of iron produced from smelter. Together, the message is a metalwork catalogue Documntation of iron smelting and production of ingots from factory.

Courtesy: Dennys Frenez The component hieroglyphs in this hypertext are metalwork wealth resources of a phaḍa 'cobra hood' rebus: phaḍa, paṭṭaḍa 'metals manufactory' Components read rebus in Meluhha are: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working iron'; khonda singi 'spiny-horned young bull' rebus: konda singi 'guild of ornament goldsmiths'; miṇḍā́l 'markhor' (CDIAL 10310) Rebus: meḍ (Ho.); mẽṛhet 'iron' (Munda.Ho.); ibha, karibha 'elephant' rebus: ib, karba 'iron'; kamadha 'penance' rebus: kammata 'mint, coiner, coinage'; muh 'face' rebus: mũh 'ingot' mũhã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end (Santali); पोळ pōḷa, 'zebu, bos indicus taurus' rebus pōḷa 'magnetite, ferrous-ferric oxide Fe3O4' . Thus, the hypertext is a metalwork wealth resource catalogue of a phada 'metals manufactory'.

Cosmic Dancer Naṭarāja sculpture narratives of Gajasamhāra, Apasmāra, intimations from Indus Script
https://tinyurl.com/ybewu85s
Note: The roots of Naṭarāja sculpture narratives are traceable to Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization with the discovery of a dancer statue dated to ca. 2500 BCE, because the dance step is a karaṇa rebus: karaṇa 'scribe' in Indus Script.
Photographs of Male Dancing Figure from Harappa harappa.com "Although its contours are soft and effeminate, the figure is that of a male, and it seems likely that it was ithyphallic, since the membrum virile was made in a separate piece. I infer, too, from the abnormal thickness of the neck, that the dancer was three-headed or at any rate three-faced, and I conjecture that he may represent the youthful Siva Nataraja." (Marshall, Mohenjo-daro, I., 45-46.)

Naṭarāja, Chennakesava Temple
The Naṭarāja sculpture of Chennakesava temple, Belur shows amazing details: a snake entering into eye of a skull and emerging out of the throat of the skull, as the cosmic dance progresses. On his left hands, dhanus (bow), palm leaves and a writing instrument are held. On his right hands are held the damaru, the post holding up a skull,rudraksha bead necklace. He also wears small snakes as ornaments. Holding a triśula with both hands, the trident spear pierces into the belly of an attacking demon. Naṭarāja dances on the body of अप

The sculptural prayers offered by the sculptors at Belur and Halebidu have no parallel anywhere in the globe. It is as if, the sculptors entered into the state of samadhi, recollecting the splendour of the cosmic dance and rendering narratives recounted in texts of the Dance King. The sculptural prayers are accompanied by musicians heralding the events.
Many splendid moments of the Cosmic Dance are frozen in stone and seen in Chennakesava, Hoysalesvara temples, Belur, Halebidu.

Is चित् cit, 'consciousness' computable?
Another way to pose this question is: since चित् cit, 'consciousness' is a personal experience, is it computable?

Cosmic dancer in CERN, Geneva. One way to pose the question is to ask who is apasmara? "According to Hindu mythology, Apasmāra was a dwarf who represented ignorance and epilepsy. He is also known as Muyalaka or Muyalakan. To preserve knowledge in the world, Apasmāra could not be killed; to do so would throw out the balance of knowledge and ignorance—as to kill Apasmāra would mean attaining knowledge without effort, dedication and hard work. Consequently, this would lead to the devaluing of knowledge in all forms. To subdue Apasmāra, Lord Śiva adopted the form of Śrī Naṭarāja - the Lord of Dance and performed the cosmic dance of Tāṇḍava. During this dance, Śrī Naṭarāja suppressed Apasmāra by crushing him with his right foot. As Apasmāra is one of the few demons destined to immortality, it is believed that Lord Śivaforever remains in his Śrī Naṭarāja form suppressing Apasmāra for all eternity. This mythological dwarf is generally depicted with his hand in Añjali Mudrā. He is often depicted in this posture in depictions of Naṭarāja. Apasmāra is also a neurological disorder described in Āyurveda, known as epilepsy According to Maharṣi Caraka, there are 4 types of apasmāra." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apasmara
