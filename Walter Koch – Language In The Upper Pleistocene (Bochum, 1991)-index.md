Bochum Publications in
Evolutionary Cultural Semiotics
EDITORIAL
BPX is a series of monographs or collections of papers (also resulting from pertinent colloquia) that are published at irregular intervals. The series is designed to bring into focus the interaction of nature and culture. Particular emphasis will be given to the overall ideas of integration and focus. Communicative processes will be considered to be integrated parts of cosmogenesis, biogenesis, psychogenesis etc. The fundamental processes underlying all levels of evolution are assumed to be identical. Not unlike most other sciences, evolutionary semiotics is considered to share in an ultimately unitary and indivisible reality. Its specificity is derived solely from its focus on a particular level of evolution: although seemingly obvious, the exact nature of this inevitable bias (human or proto-human predicament) continues to deserve concentrated attention. The prototypical structure for this is considered to be culture: a phenomenon whose true integrative potentialities have not yet been fully discovered or explored. For a semiotics thus conceived, structure and process are not different phases of reality and/or sciences but rather mere faces of a unitary field. In the view of this series, then, any fruitful attempt at semiotic analysis will be based on premises of macro-integration - or evolution - and of micro-integration - or culture. While it is the ambitious goal of this series to encourage interdisciplinary work on the nature of culture as outlined above, BPX will have to be content especially in its initial stages - with more modest attempts at elucidating semiogenesis. In addition, most contributions will presumably be relatively specific, covering all possible areas of culture or proto-culture, with the desired unity or homogeneity - regarding aim and scope - largely confined to the background.

I ntroduc t or v Remarks
The following essay was designed as an introductory contribution to the symposium on "Language and Culture in the Palaeolithic" con vened at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, May 1990. It will also serve as an introductory chapter to the proceedings of this symposium (to be edited by Udo L. Figge und W. A. Koch: "Language in the Würm Glaciation. Acta Colloquii. BPX 27"). Some of the wordings of this essay are, accordingly, framed in such a way as to adumbrate the contributions of the other symposiants: Robin Allott, Bernard H. Bichakjian, Tatiana Chernigovskaya, Udo L. Figge, Eric de Grolier, Vitalij Shevoroshkin and Jan Wind (pertinent brief excerpts of whose writings are recorded in the appendix of the essay). In view of the accelerating pace in the attempts at long-range reconstruction of the evolution of language, I thought it not in appropriate to acquaint those interested in such endeavours, as soon as possible, with such an essay - although more elaborate versions are to follow suit, hopefully in the not too distant future.
Bochum, March 1991 W.A.K.






To Ladislav G. Altmann on the Occasion of His Sixtieth Birthday
Language and Würm Glaciation
Many pieces of evidence support the hypothesis that humans of the Würm glaciation had at their disposal a relatively elaborate kind of vocal communication (cf. KOCH 1990, 1991 dawn). Very probably they used such signifiers as [kukku:?] or [wuluiku] for referring to animals ("cuckoo" or "wolf) and it is likely that they should even have used cross-modal associations (mutual mapping of visual/motor units and vocal units) leading to such words as [gini] for "tooth" or [piku] for "mountain". And, of course, such rudimentary language was far from being "arbitrary". However, the fossil evidence for the Würm-phase is anything but homogeneous. It has recently become apparent that two different subspecies or "superraces" of Homo sapiens came to live side by side; they probably even mixed and merged in some places: Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and early Homo sapiens sapiens (SMITH, SPENCER (eds.) 1984; FREEMAN 1980; SHACKLEY 1980; ECCLES 1989: 62ff.). The following figure may serve as a simple frame of orientation (cf. CALDER 1983; CLARK 1961; VARAGNAC (ed.) 1960; DAVIDSON, NOBLE 1989; SHERRAT (ed.) 1980):

Neanderthal Speech
I. Neanderthal Speech
To the 19th century, Neanderthals seemed to be the quintessence of low intelligence and lack of speech. Ernst Haeckel christened the Neanderthal Homo alalus, the human lacking language (NARR 1982). Until very recently, Neanderthals have been held in low esteem. And it were the most knowledgeable and meticulous researchers like Philip Lieberman (cf. LIEBERMAN, CRELIN 1971; LIEBERMAN 1975, 1984; KRANTZ 1980) who even in modern times came to the conclusion that the reconstruction of the supralaryngeal vocal tract suggests that all hominids except modem Homo sapiens lacked consonants like the velar stops, [ k ] and [ g ], that they could not clearly differentiate between [ i ], [ a ], [ u ], in short that they could not boast the rudiments of speech, it was also pointed out that the speech apparatus of Homo erectus or of Neanderthals was more like that of a human infant (LIEBERMAN, CRELIN 1971; cf. WHITE, BROWN 1972: 103). But then it ought to come as a surprise that young infants - aged four months - start - with the onset of the "babbling phase" - to form "normal" consonants and vowels (cf. LOCKE 1983: 44). Thus, an echogenelical (i.e. anatomical/neurological/linguistic) correlation between "babbling" and the language capacity of as early a hominid as Homo habilis (cf. Fig. 2.1) - let alone that of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis - suggests that there must have been a reasonable set of consonant-like and vowel-like phones for more than two million years. And a lot of severe criticism as to the purely anatomical interpretation of Lieberman's reconstruction has also piled up in the meantime (cf. de GROL1ER 1989: 86ff.; WIND 1989: 187f.). The far older acoustic qualities of hominoid calls (JORDAN 1971) and the findings of paleoneurology (FALK in KRANTZ 1980: 780, FALK 1983) rather suggest a very deep-rooted ability of forming distinct sounds of speech. It may well be the case that early Homo sapiens sapiens (Broken Hill, Djebel Qafzeh, Skhul V etc.: 100,000 - 90,000 ya) was phonically superior to the stouter and more stolid contemporary Neanderthals (La Ferrassie, La Chapelle) (cf. Figs. 0, 3.1, 3.2; LIEBERMAN 1975: 160; LIEBERMAN 1984: 306; FREEMAN 1980; ECCLES 1989: 70). At any rate, since we have to assume that Homo habilis was already capable of producing rhythmical chains of articulated consonant-like and vowel-like sounds (TOBIAS 1986: 757; FIGGE 1990 language: 220), Neanderthals may safely be assumed to have been potentially glib speakers of a human language. If we shy away from making concrete proposals as to what Neanderthal speech may have sounded like, we can make little progress. There are no refutations where there are no hypotheses. Without a concrete stage model (cf. Fig. 2.1) the entire area between Habilis and Neanderthal will remain shrouded in some vague idea of "sound symbolism". Two pieces of paleofiction and their film versions have been

Neanderthal Speech
more audacious and less restrained than scientists and scholars usually are. Thus, the fdm "La Guerre du feu" (based on a novel by ROSNY (1977)) and "Ayla and the Clan of the Cave Bear" (following AUEL (1980)) are two attempts at reconstruing life in the southern parts of Central and Eastern Europe during Wiirm 111, i.e. at a time when HSN and HSS (cf. Figure 0) lived side by side, as contemporaries, roughly 35,000 ya. While HSS is shown in the films to be more voluble than HSN, Neanderthals are credited with a powerful, though halting kind of speech. Fig. 1.1 shows some of the efforts at palaeofictional reconstruction. Part A treats us to some samples of "Ulam" - supposedly the language of early HSS, a contemporary of HSN. The reconstructionist's imagination seems to have been kindled by a mixture of present-day or - at least well-known languages: thus dekte for "speak" seems to be related to German zeigen or Latin dicere, Greek deiknumi etc., wei "victory" makes us recall English woe, German wehe, Latin vae (victis) ! Vir and cur are definitely Latin, sleckt German and only Tir Meg for "mammoth" betrays an attempt at deeper reconstruction. While Tir (German Tier, English deer) may be at least common to Germanic, if not to Indo-European *dheu-z-om "the breathing thing" (cf. POKORNY 1959: 261), Meg (mak/mok/mek) may even be "Universal-Proto-Speech" (cf. § 5; SWADESH 1971: 210) for "big, giant, powerful". But then the really probable etymology for mammoth (Russian marnant' < Tungus, Yakut mamma "earth" - "because the Tungus and Yakuts believed that this animal worked its way in the earth like a mole" (SKEAT 1958: 358)) can more easily be recognized as some very ancient word: mamma for "mother, milk, nature as yielding food to humans" may be due to a design-scheme (TATA cf. Fig. 2.1) that is at least half a million years old. As a rule, however, HSS or HSN speech as conceived of in the first film (cf. A in Fig. 1.1) is - like Esperanto - more a mélange of today's arbitrary languages than a good try at the reconstruction of the natural design schemes of yore. (The same holds for the reconstrual of HSS gestural language, Fig. 1.1; the question of whether or not these suggestions turn out to be natural may be tested by a comparison with such sign-languages as ASL, BSL, CSL etc. (cf. KLIMA and BELLUG1 1979)).

Neanderthal Speech
Although the second film's reconstruction continues to be palaeofiction, it is, to my mind, far nearer a probable kind of reality. The speech used in "Ayla and the Clan of the Cave Bear" (cf. Fig. 1.2) is definitely meant to be that of the late Neanderthals. Although the stills taken from this film are only a poor rendition of the actual pictures of the movie, they may betray a portion of discrete concreteness that transcends the normal vague reconstruction of Neanderthal reality. The same sort of combined haziness and vividness which is given in the two pictures of Fig. 1.2 (first still: Ayla, the HSS girl, adopted by a HSN band as a foster-child, second still: male members of the HSN band deliberating on whether or not the group's shaman (named "Kreb") will have to be outlawed from the band.) is matched by what we can know about HSN-speech (or about early HSS-speech, for that matter): it is a combination of inevitable uncertainty and necessary minimum concreteness. Unlike the assumptions made by the first film, Neanderthal speech is here the result of a more or less necessary sequence of more and more complex, though natural, layers. The particular scheme Prae-Neanderthals may already have arrived at, about 120,000 ya, I propose calling the DING-DONG scheme (cf. Fig. 2.1; KOCH 1991 dawn). The classic Neanderthal of about 35,000 ya is probably more advanced in that he already put to everyday public use (SING SONG II: cf. KOCH 1990,1991 dawn) a capacity for speech which was initially developed by the exclusive mother-infant dyad - cf. Fig. 2.1, §2. The main point to be made about DING DONG is that it was a phonic translation that connected stimuli given by visual or motor processes to responses that were entirely auditory. A process that needs a lot of explaining and commenting on. "Sound symbolism" is a poor description of such a process (cf., however, ALLOTT 1989; KOCH 1990, 1991 dawn). I am aware of the need for detailed presentation of evidence. I have, however, to postpone a minute sort of analysis. I have here to be content with advancing hypotheses and only alluding to supportive data. Fig. 1.2 notes a putative Neanderthal speech-act (as taken from the film):

Neanderthal Speech
This sentence is in accordance with the Ding-Dong scheme which - it is suggested (Fig. 2.1, KOCH 1991 dawn) - was highly operative in Neanderthals; kreb may be connected to German Kraft, English craft. Old Norse kroptr "power, charm", but also to cripple, cramp; it is related to an Indo-European *grep~. A. more universal sound - symbolic interpretation of g(r)a(m)p or k(r)a(m)p may reveal a syncretic field of meanings which have to do with "powerful use of one's hands and tools (catching, grasping, hitting etc.)." Thus, while the first form has been arrived at by metagenetic ( ^| ) reconstruction and its putative
(reconstructed) form has been asterisked, the second form is rather gained by genetic ( £>) reasoning (cf. §6). Its approximate distinctness is not only deduced from panchronic manceuvers of "sound symbolism", but also from a step-by-step evolution of sequential design-schemes (cf. Fig. 2.1). Its putative form is therefore marked by a mini-circle:
A 2 [^> °kra(m)p ... *grep
The possible time-interval ("...") may be 30,000 years or - in case those concerned with long-distance reconstruction succeed in reconstruing, on the basis of today's arbitrary language forms, human languages of 25,000 - 35,000 years ago (SHEVOROSHK1N (ed.) 1989 Methods, 1990 mother) - the time-interval may become zero. Similar interpretations may hold for the remainder of A 1. In other words, the intuitive reconstruction applied to the second case of palaeofiction was not a bad show. If my reconstruction (KOCH 1991 dawn) is reasonable, Neanderthals - although possibly counting over 3,000 different dialects all over Europe, Asia and Northern Africa - were still pretty conservative in dealing with their phonetic shapes. They will have made it a point that sound-shapes, however much diverging from its initial format, did not abscond into total arbitrariness: they were probably able to reinterpret (etymologize) almost every word according to its sound-symbolism motivation. (In the same way as present-day manual sign-languages such as ASL - can, in the majority of their segments, at least be reinterpreted as natural signs). - Similar things may have applied for the contemporary early HSS in Africa and Asia. - Thus, HSN could not have afforded to let a BOW-WOW word (BOW WOW being even "more natural" than the more frequent DING DONG words of HSN) such as
A3 °mwuu "cow"
phonically drift away as probably it did in later Indo-European languages and in Modem English [kau]:
8



Neanderthal Speech
A4 [kau] < Germanic *ku < Indo-European *gwU < "UPS"***mwuu
[kau] nowadays no longer evokes the onomatopoetic intent which we find in the BOW-WOW neologism of Modem English:
A 5 [mu:] "moo" (as of cows!)
On the other hand. Neanderthal speech will have had many possibilities for rendering similar (or identical) concepts. Thus sentences 1 and 2 (in B of Fig. 1.1) may have been more or less synonymous: Mugu (meg "big", u referring to "awe") may be another word for a powerful, respected leader of a band; ka^k (like kna, ayka, noga etc.) may have been a DING DONG word for making a striding movement of the leg (knee etc.), 5 possibly referring to a gliding, disappearing aspect of movements, mara conjuring up a process of "flowing", "disintegrating", "crumbling". As I said before, the crucial point is the plausibility of the DING DONG phonic-semantic pairings. I have here to shortcut the explanation of the rationale. It would need an entire volume. Old types of evidence will have to be reevaluated, new experiments on the various types of "sound symbolism" (not unlike layers II through VII of Fig. 2.1) will have to be implemented. But since evidence of this kind seems to be mounting, 1 cannot here resist the temptation to preempt on more refined analyses and present a possible case of concreteness. Ding-Dong schemes, although more powerful than Bow-Wow schemes (the former possibly presenting an average of 3,000 different sound shapes or "roots" as against - at least - 300 of the latter), involve many cases of ambiguity. And these are the germs for budding arbitrariness. One and the same concept, e.g. "powerful leader", could have been associated with many different sound shapes - depending on the underlying perceptual scheme (kreb having to do with "gripping/ hitting movement", mug referring to a "more static visual impression of 'might' as in words for 'mountain' or 'muscle'").
A 6 "powerful man —> °kreb, °mugu
And since the phonic repertoires of Neanderthals possibly consisted of no more than 15-30 'phonemes' and relatively simple (noncompounded) words, the risk of one and the same signifier meaning different things was very high. Thus °kreb may have meant "powerful, gripping etc.", deriving from motor-action-sound correlations imitating a gripping/grasping arm/hand-movement, but °kreb may also have been the result of a more pristine sound-imitative (BOW-WOW II) process imitating the crawling and pincing movements of animals; it may thus have served to also signify crab, Krebs, Käfer, scarabaeus, scorpion etc. Thus there may have been
9



Design Schemes for the Evolution of Language
homonyms such as the following ones:
A 7 °kreb 1. Power, powerful man. 2. Crawling animal. 3. Container serving to hold things...
Yet, although there should have been in Neanderthal speech a lot of non-uniqueness and equivocalness (synonyms and homonyms), and a wide variety of forms of the same word
A 8 °kreb variants in the same dialect: ogsr£p, °kxapp , °kharp etc.,
such relative uncertainty would probably never go as far as mixing up essential bits of speech. Thus a sentence meaning "whenever a wolf howls, mother is numb with fear", however wide its margin of phonic realization, could hardly ever be mistaken for meaning some such thing as "If Kreb leaves us, he will die" (cf. Example 3 in B of Fig. 1.1).
2. Design Schemes for the Evolution of Language
In the beginning (i.e. before fully fledged modem arbitrary language began to hold its sway), everything was natural. The only question is how natural patterns became transferred from one part of morphology/behaviour to another part (in our above cases of Neanderthal speech: from visual/motor processes to auditory copies of them). The processes at work in the evolution of language seem to be aptly characterized by Stephen Jay GOULD's post-neo-Darwinian view of evolution (in: PARKER, GIBSON 1979: 385):
A 9 "I believe it is no longer permissible to build a speculative model on the premise that nearly all bits of morphology and behavior are direct results of natural selection working specifically for them. We must take more seriously the issues of developmental and design constraints (limits imposed by the delicate orchestration of ontogeny and by the nature of biological materials), and the importance of nonfunctional correlation (emphasis mine)."
Independently of Gould's more embracing view of evolution, I have come to emphasize dimensions which initially seemed but truisms to me, but which turned out to be worth holding on to in the most radical manner. A simple paraphrase of these dimensions is given by Fig. 2.1. It shows a horizontal dimension of design features and a vertical one offering a sequence of design schemes (details in KOCH 1991 dawn). One important design-feature aspect is still missing in this preliminary
10



Design Schemes for the Evolution of Language
diagram: it is the interrelationship of the coexisting and coevolving modes of sensory input and motor output (i.a. facial mimics, manual gestures, vocal gestures - alluded to in Fig. 2.1 via "g = gestural communication"!. The synchronicity and mutual overflow (F1GGE 1990 language, KINSBOURNE 1978) of different modal processes that probably existed in early hominid evolution are the richest subsoils for the transfer of naturalness and for the fixation of signs flowing from biological processes (DAVIDSON, NOBLE 1989: 133; GIBSON 1966). It indeed plays a great role in the DING-DONG scheme of language that probably originated no later than 150.000 ya. And it played equally important roles in preceding schemes: e.g. in as early a scheme as the BLA BEA of Homo habili.s comparable to the cross-modal overflow and synchronicity in the proto-conversation (TREVARTHEN 1986 Development, Form; HALL 1984) and babbling stages of human ontogeny. The origin of language is often linked to the supposedly great surge in cognitive faculties of about 40,000 ya (Gordon HEWES in KRANTZ 1980: 781). Other researchers emphasize the probability that language evolution is a gradual integrative process involving many subsequent schemes. In such a view, there is little leeway for punctuated big bangs or monogenetic uniqueness (cf. Maciej HENNEBERG in KRANTZ 1980). Alexander MARSH ACK (in PARKER/G1BSON 1979: 385) described the need for multilayered mosaic-like constellations very nicely:
A 10 "If human language is cross-modal and associative, involving, in its evolution, the use of the spectrum of available coinmunicalixe and marking modes, then what evolved was cross-modal and associative and probably simultaneously involved gestural, facial, vocal, behavioral and relational aspects. This formulation implies an inadequacy in all simple, unitary, one-dimensional explanations for the origin of language."
Very simply, Gould's two pieces of admonition (A 9) relate to the two dimensions of our admittedly highly simplified mosaic of language evolution (Fig. 2.1): design features (among them the features of cross-modal "synchronicity": cf. KIMURA 1982, KENT 1984) are tantamount to Gould's "nonfunctional correlations", our design schemes, i.e. the ten schemes of glottogenesis. are characterized by Gould's "design constraints". The lingual translation of motor action (at the roots of the TA TA. CLICK CLICK, DING DONG schemes) is initially nonfunctional, as is any other part of the evolutionary mosaic. Babbling, the mother-infant dyad (cf. "situation ot the v-schemc in Fig. 2.1 showing the evolution of this important feature) and further decisive factors tor glottogenesis are characterized by the very tact that they apparently lack any visible adaptive function. As is normally the case in microevolution, "structure precedes function" (FALK 1985); even such
11



Design Schemes for the Evolution of Language
wide-ranging phenomena as "neoteny" (a collective label for many hominid gene-governed innovations leading to prolonged childhood and also contributing to language) are but preadaptations waiting for a possible, much later functionalization (Doris JONAS in KRANTZ 1980: 783). The vertical dimension cf. Fig. 2.1 gives us an epitome of what Gould’s "design constraints" could mean in glottogenesis. Thus the design for the modem type of language (layer VIII) could not have evolved without the stage-by-stage precedence of the other schemes and it could not have outdone the 'inventiveness' of any prior stage without limits nor have overreached itself for the sake of some putative adaptive goal. The limits are set by the naturalness of each single stage. Very simply, language was largely hatched by mothers and infants, by the specific constraints imposed by such dyads and by the superfluity ("overflow" and "superfluousness") of their playful traditions (cf. details in KOCH 1990, 1991 dawn).

Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
3. Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
"Correlates" had been said (by Gould, cf. A 9) to be highly "non functional". Yet, they are assumed to be in mutual interdependence, they are expected to coevolve. Among the most general correlates conceivable are the dimensions of ecogenesis and echogenesis (KOCH 1991 dawn). "Echogenesis" is a cover term for possibly correlative types of geneses: phylogenesis, ontogenesis, cenogenesis etc. (cf. Fig.6). "Ecogenesis" is to refer to the innumerable "eco-taxa" which made up the complex and simultaneous environment of the specific part of evolution under focus. We here focus humans and, more specifically, glottogenesis. Figs. 3.1 and 3.2 are meant to suggest thirteen different areas (or ecotaxa) of coevolution: from "climatological environment" (A) to "cultural artefacts" (F). A naively "functional" reading would tend to offer a simple reading from left to right: A led to B, B led to types of C, C to D, D to E etc. Interpretive concepts such as "selection" and "adaptation" would then be relatively easy to apply. We have by now come to learn that such simple linear functionalization is far from being realistic. It is true that the transition from A on the one hand to B and all subsequent ecotaxa on the other will remain uni-directional: Ice ages will have had a hand in producing sea level falls, these will have led to savannahs to emerge (especially in the Miocene), the latter habitat will have led to bipedal locomotion and to "K-selection" etc. - rather than the other way round. Except for A, however, all ecotaxa have to be suspected to be in some sort of mutual selectivity: human 3-year-lactation (as against shorter periods in nonhuman primates) might have influenced the mother-infant dyad, the emergence of food-sharing and communal joy/grief/humour or give-and-take games, tool-making or even the beginning of typically human vocalization: the BLA BLA design-scheme of Homo habilis; yet all of these ecotaxa - and many others which are not mentioned in Figs. 3.1, 3.2 - will also admit of an interpretive direction which shows the reverse to be true. Ultimately, any constellation of the horizontal axis is a candidate for mutual morphogenesis. Since even the reduced implications of Figs. 3.1, 3.2 cannot nearly be exhausted here, let us be content with developing a taste for construing an eco-mosaic of structural and temporal correlation. And to this intent, a cursory glance at the message conveyed by these Figures might do. Let us try to correlate the stages of glottogenesis ( as in Fig. 2.1 and hinted at in Fig. 3.2) with corresponding stages of other ecotaxa. The most conspicuous feature for stage-comparison may be the impact of Ice Ages. Since the late Pliocene (from 3.25 mya) through the whole of the Pleistocene period (from 1.8 mya onwards) there have been 35 ice ages and a corresponding number of warm interglacials (CALDER 1983:147). As glottogenesis shows dramatic bursts since the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene, the last four glaciations (Giinz 1 mya, Mindel 500 kya,

Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
Riss 200 kya, Wiirm 100 kya) and their corresponding interglacials and interstadials may be expected to be of particular importance. From Homo erectus onwards (Fig.3.1), humans tended to migrate or "disperse" after great climatic changes: from cold to warmth and vice versa. Growing body size and growing brain size, particularly, follow from migrating to new (mostly periglacial) habitats. Valerius GEIST (1978: 190), one of the proponents of "dispersal theory", states the following:
A 11 "During dispersal into uninhabited terrain such as becomes available after glacial withdrawal, selection favours increased body size as well as a specialisation of combat and defensive adaptation during the population's dispersal phase."
Neoteny - i.a. prolonged or even generalized periods of cognitive plasticity - is a recurrent feature of such dispersal adaptation. Ever new types of neoteny emerged in the course of hominoid and hominid evolution (cf. column E in Fig. 3.1). It is again GEIST (1978: 352) who emphasizes this correlation between Ice Ages and neuro-cognitive development implicit in neoteny:
A 12 "... the further the species penetrated into unexploited, uninhabitated terrain, the more neotenous it became, that is, the more juvenile features characterized the sexually mature adult form. Therefore, where hominids colonized last we can expect them to be most neotenous; neotony or increase in juvenile characteristics in fully grown adults becomes a measure of evolutionary change."
Recently (since about 15,000 - 20,000 ya), Aleuts, Eskimos and Mongoloids have had the longest ontogenetic growth among human populations and thus are most neotenous. However, relative bursts of neoteny have attained every part of the world's population, at different times. Changes of climate (cf. Fig. 3.1. again), then, are generators of neoteny. Bipedalism, which is older and less "recurrent", and neoteny are among the crucial eco-taxa influencing glottogenesis. The former leading to, i.a., face-to-face behaviour, handedness, multimodality, the latter leading to, i.a., greater neuronic capacity and prolonged plasticity. Both combine to form the unique and extended hominid mother-infant dyad which was the cradle for any design-schemes of language (KOCH 1991 dawn). We must not forget: the preceding suggestions make for a very simplified picture of glottogenesis. And so does the following conspectus. It tries to collect some (echogenetic and ecogenetic) criteria in support of the "absolute" chronology for the evolution of design schemes (as suggested in Figs. 2.1 and 3.2):

Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
BLA BLA Homo erectus mothers will at best have tended to imitate, repeat, reinforce their hyperactive babes, CLICK CLICK becomes a slightly more cortex-governed scheme (cf. feature of "physiology of v-scheme" in Fig. 2.1). Mothers tend, in an early type of "baby talk" or 'molherese", to exploit some of the infants' vegetative sounds (while the baby sucks or impatiently tries to suck). Bilabial, dental and palatal clicks as concomitant vegetative sounds are turned - by observing mothers - into stereotyped phones with first definite meanings attached to them (bilabials meaning "mother, suck ...", dentals focussing "attention" etc.). All through half a million years the intimate mother-infant dyad may have developed about 30 different protowords referring to syncretic meaning areas that involve "eating, mother, you, I, attention, swallowing, tongue, lips, etc." [0303] (cf. Fig. 2.2), which mother emits when referring to the "child having to continue sucking", is among the first words, then. In actogenesis, today, such clicks are still being used in various types of motherese; as phonemes, clicks have mainly been preserved in Khoisan languages. At any rate, clicks were probably the first sounds to result from some unwitting sort of imitative stereotypisation. It were stereotypes of what had initially been a non-communicative sound (i.e. transfer of "sucking"—"lip-smacking"). In ontogeny, both pointing (as a manual gesture) and clicking tend to derive from the same underlying freezing type of processes (cf. DAVIDSON, NOBLE 1989: 133 - REICH 1986, TREVARTHEN). - Clicks survive in actogenetic telegraphic speech, e. g. in English or German [ / ] (alveolar click) expressing "impatience, attention, disapproval".
IV (500 kya) TA TA: The two main processes that make TA TA improve upon CLICK CLICK are the transformation of clicks into corresponding simple distinct expiratory phones and the beginning of mother-child cooperation (cooperative games, "peekaboo" etc.: TREVARTHEN 1989) leading to reference. Reference is, in this case, transcending the mother-infant dyad: it becomes directed towards a third party: a toy, a cooperative game, a 'peripheral' father 1 (Cf. again the abstract description of the evolution of the "situation of the v-scheme" in Fig. 2.1). In TA TA the set of protowords begins to evolve to a lexicon of about 30 units. Lingual fossils of this scheme are today such words as [mama], [papa], [dada], [kaka]. But also more complex meta-vegetative sequences such as [gula], [dirya], [leka] referring to "tongue (movements)" or [maqa], [hapa] referring to "eating (movements)". - In ontogenesis, TA TA is tantamout to the first words (e.g. dada meaning "look there", "father" etc. - REICH 1986 - at about 8/9 months). - Frank LIVINGSTONE (in KRANTZ 1980: 784) suggests that language evolved in erectus populations. From what is offered in our (as yet) simple picture of ecogenesis (cf.Figs. 3.1, 3.2), the TA TA scheme - which, like in a
23



Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
nine-month-old in ontogeny, is real protoreferential language - is more likely to have emerged with Homo sapiens archaicus . Infant cooperative playing is here correlated to cooperative hunting and first types of self-reference (strange landmarks or "sites" serving as centres for tribe/band-identity) etc. These behaviours seeem to start with Archaicus (Figs. 3.1, 3.2).
V (250 kya) BOW WOW: Homo sapiens praesapiens developed a totally new mechanism of vocalization. Imitation of the sounds of other species or of nature at large cannot be observed with his predecessors or with any of the hominoids: [mu:mu:] for bovids or [wulu:k] and [bau wau] for wolf-like or hyena-like animals and up to 300 different further words enriched the repertoire of referential words dramatically. This new tendency of referring to and imitating the outside world may have led to an early kind offuror onomasticus. Although the mother-infant dyad, as I understand it, concocted these and other new phonic potentialities and had little need or reason for passing them on to the adult world of the band/tribe, stereotyped naming (for interpersonal and geographic maps) might have set in on a large scale even in adulthood. More complex and creative "conversation" was probably reserved to the plasticity-bond of mother and infant. - What made Homo sapiens praesapiens in general so apt at 'inventing' this new powerful ploy? Some of the correlations may be found in the phenomenon of "large-bodied desert types" of humans emerging as a result of migrations in the Holstein interglacial (GEIST 1978; cf. Fig. 3.1). LAITMAN (1985) thinks that there is especial palaeo-neurological evidence for H. s. praesapiens having had "language". It is noteworthy that the Bow-Wow imitation scheme is coeval with further mimetic feats of praesapiens. "250 kya" is a time that also saw the symbolic use of red ochre (imitation of "blood", "life" etc.; V.V. IVANOV in PARKER, GIBSON 1979:388f.), the first mimetic figurines (GOREN-INBAR 1986), emblazoned tools (CALDER 1983:150; cf. Fig. 3.2). In ontogeny, Bow Wow sets in with 10-month-olds (REICH 1986). In actogenesis, present-day typologies for rendering the bark/howl of wolves and canids have a wide range of variation (cf. KOCH 1991 dawn), there seems, however, to be an unmistakable universal consonantal formula for it: "Labial (+liquid) (+velar/palatal/labial)" or any permutation of it: [wulk], [kalb], [klaf], [lup], [balk], [bark], [wub], [bel], [jap] etc. (Possibly we have to be more specific regarding different types of canid vocalization and thereby reduce the range of variation.). At any rate, the percentage of Bow Wow in today's languages is higher than is normally assumed to be the case, especially if we include onomatopoetics which have become opaque (like "cow" in English).
VI (120 kya) DING DONG: H.s. praeneanderthalensis and types of early HSS (ECCLES 1989:62ff.; TRINKAUS 1983) came to revolutionize
24



Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
Bow Wow. The imitative process was transferred from the scheme "vocal copies vocal" to the scheme "vocal copies motor or visual process". There are processes of mutual mapping (in neighbouring zones of the sensory-motor areas - the perisylvian system of the dominant cortical hemisphere (KINSBOURNE, HICKS 1978; FIGGE 1990 language)) for "instinctively" matching distinctive perceptual (motor and/or visual) constellations with exactly corresponding distinctive vocal patterns. Thus "(bending of the) leg, knee, arm, elbow" and, by extension, "giving birth to, woman etc." tend to be referred to by "Nasal + Velar Stop" (or permutations of it): [kne], [gone], [noga], [anka], [agna], [kuna]. While the combination of "something heavy or blunt plus something pointed, or processes involved therewith" (more specifically: "objects falling to the humus-covered ground", "mountain", "hill", "triangle", "tent") are rendered by "Labial + Dental/Velar": [pet], [pek], [kep], [tep]. The two overall processes - however wide their own inner margins of phonic variation - are, in their motor formats, kept strictly apart. The story of DING DONG is a long and complex one. 1 have to cut it short here. Max Müller, who invented the nickname for the process, was certainly wrong in denigrating the idea of it (cf. KOCH 1991 dawn). DING DONG is certainly the natural basis of all subsequent arbitrary languages. Nothing arbitrary fell out of the blue. Everything has a DING-DONG origin (or an origin relating to preceding schemes). DING DONG is in principle omnipotent in that it may acoustically imitate anything. Thus a set of 3,000 different DING DONG words could easily have been reached by later Neanderthals (60,000 ya) or early Cro-Magnons (40,000 ya). We might note here that L.L. CAVALLI-SFORZA and others think that - because of evidence in the gene-tradition - early HSS - i.e. humans of the Eem interglacial, 100 kya - developed language "as we know it" (and DING DONG is essentially language "as we know it") (cf. BATEMAN et al. 1990: 10). - In ontogeny, eleven-month-olds start inventing idiomorphs (lakell "chair", likill "doll chair", lukull "overstuffed chair" (REICH 1986:39)). Idiomorphic processes are identical with the proto-types of "DING DONG la": mik "small" vs. mak "big" (KOCH 1991 dawn).
VII (70 kya) SING SONG: Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and his small-face contemporaries of early HSS may be credited with many cultural inventions: rituals, proto-narratives, large-scale cooperative hunting etc. And there are especially large brains, too (PFEIFFER 1982, TRINKAUS 1983). I have to cut my story short. In view of the fact that Neanderthals tend to ritually forge units larger than bands (dialectal tribes of 500 people; cf. column three in F of Fig. 3.2) and to institute complex rituals, it seems highly probable that by the time of the Würm interstadial, Homo sapiens may have had women/mothers and juveniles/infants attend the sacred male rituals. Initially such things happened only on the
25



Ice Ages and Hominid Evolution
periphery of the pantomimic male performance. The mother-infant community transferred their own specific vocal competence (last surge of it in DING DONG!) onto complex, consecutive, protonarrative motor behavior: onto the rituals of the male hunters. At later stages (SING SONG II), the females' and infants' verbal accompaniment of male action turned from being superfluous comment to being the sole semiotic vehicle of narration. Thus DING-DONG language becomes fully functionalized and is from now on the standard means of communication in dialectal tribes (cf. KOCH 1991 Stereotypy).
VIII (40 kya) CONVENTION: The early art of depiction of the Upper Paleolithic shows first signs of opacity (DAVIDSON, NOBLE 1989: 136). Art and, presumably, languages tend to lose their natural underground. DING DONG allows people to fall back on natural processes fairly well known to them, again and again. But with the advent of HSS proper (40 kya) and the respective fine-tuning of phonetic abilities, exact copies not so much of extemal/natural stimuli but of language habits themselves {allophonic exactitude!) became a new target for tradition. The xenofactor, the awareness of both tribe-identity and otherness, became the seedbed for more radical arbitrariness (KOCH 1991 Biology, chapter 4). The fine-tuning of phonation has its well-known analogue in the fine-tuning of manual sequential dexterity (blade industries; cf. Fig. 3.1). While with HSN there probably was already relatively high differ entiation of genes (cf. Figs. 5.3, 5.4), HSS may develop extreme lingual differentiation, too (cf. §§ 4, 5).
IX (20 kya) "UPS": "Universal Proto-Speech" is here used to cover the types of human language that existed during Würm III. This point-in-time is considered by some researchers to be a period where human language still reflected the first phase of (monogenetic?) differentiation, i.e. of little differentiation, if any (cf. WESCOTT 1974, SWADESH 1971); others think that it is the time of different human races and different macrophyla of language (cf. Figs. 5.1 ff.). Some long-range reconstructions hold that proto-proto-proto-languages (PL III = "UPS") were initially under differentiated. They place these beginnings in the Near East, about 35,000 years ago. Words belonging to that era are thought to be nigi/gini for "tooth" or tal/dal for "tongue" (SHEVOROSHKIN 1989: 26). From such "PL III" or "UPS" seven or so macrophyia of languages (reconstructed as proto-proto-languages (PL II)) are said to have descended: Nostratic, Congo-Saharan, Khoisan, Austric, Amerind, Dene-Caucasian etc. (cf. Fig. 5.1). Differentiation in language may then be coeval with the greater migrations of HSS into Asia, America and Australia, from 25 kya to 10 kya.

X (10 kya) PROTO-LANGUAGE-STAGE: From "UPS’ and PL II a stage reflecting simple proto-languages such as Indo-European (cf. GAMKRELIDZE, IVANOV 1990) is said to derive. Protolanguages (PL I), which may date as far back as 8,000 ya (RENFREW 1987), are the farthest point a cautious linguist is prepared to go back in his recon structions. Proto-languages, i.e. differentiation that is even greater than PL II - a Tower-of-Babel effect -, set in as an aftermath to the beginning explosion of the population in the Neolithic (cf. Figs. 3.1, 3.2).
4. Design Schemes in the Würm Glaciation
Reconstruction, like any other type of con-struction, is best executed by starting out on a polar basis. Thus, we try to cover the period of the "Würm glaciation" by approaching it from two opposite directions (Fig.4). Metagenetic ) reconstruction proceeds from present-day languages to ever more "asterisked" stages:
A 13 Proto-Language (e.g. Indo-European): * gwena "woman" Proto-Proto-Language (e.g. Nostratic): **kuni "woman" Proto-Proto-Proto-Language (i.e. "UPS"): ***kuna "woman"
Genetic ( ) reconstruction proceeds the other way around:
A 14 DING DONG I/II: a variety of phonetic gestalts . SING SONG I/II: referring to"woman": °kuna/noga/kw'ni
CONVENTION: -remaining more or less unchanged (?)
The seam (or rather the "zone") where the two ways of linguistic epistemology conspicuously meet (or rather "overlap") is between 20 kya and 35 kya (Fig. 4). As I see it, there are at least three big problems. One is the question as to what extent reconstructions of PL II and PL III are really now exhibiting the soundest basis they should or could have. Despite some misgivings, I should venture to claim that there is - to say the least considerable heuristic value in such endeavours. Overskepticalness in such matters does not bear any concrete fruit. But, very trivially, the inferences as drawn from long-range reconstructions will have to become more sophisticated. The second problem concerns the reverse approach. The various natural schemes proposed (from BLA BLA to SING SONG) have to be based on far more numerous data than seem to be readily available at present. The third point - given some plausibility for both types of reconstruction - is the query to what extent, where exactly in the

time-scale, and how often the two underlying main characteristics of language, namely arbitrariness and naturalness, gain a temporary upper hand. Metagenetic reconstructionists are mostly keen on language forms which they implicitly assume to be unique (i.e. arbitrary) (cf. ILLlC-SVITYi 1971 - as reported in SHEVOROSHKIN (ed.) 1989, 1990). Genetic reconstructionists expect natural schemes not only for a time between 2 mya and 40 kya but they are also looking for them as recurrent phenomena in present-day languages. Thus, the astonishing fact that, for instance, some such forms as kuna, gune, agna meaning "woman" have survived in so many languages almost unchanged through at least 100 ky may point to some inherent stability of this very word, or it may point to the possibility of there being a recurrent DING-DONG process at work which from time to time (every 5-10 ky, say) substitutes a DING DONG neologism kuna/gona ... for an archaism that may have become opaque. And this, of course, in many different languages, independently of each other. (Initially kuna "woman" is almost as universal as kuna "knee", which points to the underlying DING-DONG link: knee-bending as prototypical for birth-giving (cf. KOCH 1991 dawn)). Thus, the naturalness phenomenon may render the arduous task of reconstructing words even more difficult.
5. Languages of Würm III and "UPS"
Würm III saw the last few millenia of a time when recent HSS and HSN coexisted in some way or other. The last definite HSN skeletal remains date back to about 34 kya (Tabun, Middle East, SHACKLEY 1980:123). HSS (with possible admixtures of HSN) had started to migrate into America (LAUGHLIN, HARPER 1979:3) and Australia (Lake Mungo: THORNE 1980) 20 kya or 40 kya, respectively. From about 20 kya onwards (during the time of Western and Central European Gravettian cultures), there appears to have built up another big wave of migration (involving the Americas and Australia again, and also Africa, and - as always - Asia). Very probably, there were many more waves of human migration and genetic differentiation and intermingling. But while we undoubtedly have to reckon with differentiation - there will be unification (convergence) as well. So far we have known too little about processes regarding populations supplanting, mixing with, or exterminating each other. It may be wise to make allowance for a high portion of admixture - even for HSS and HSN - and this on the level of both genes and languages. In the whole of biology and also in linguistics, a branching-tree model of reconstruction seems to be inevitable. Though in the view of both epistemology and ontology, there invariably is something to this fundamental idea of differentiation, the least we could do in terms of
30



Languages of Würm III and "UPS"
realistically balancing such a trivial view is our always calling to mind opposite manoeuvres as well. There seldom is - in biogenesis or glottogenesis - total uniformity at the start and extreme differentiation at the end. There sometimes is rather the need for the opposite view, for the idea of a tree-tumed-upside-down: differentiation transmuting into more and more uniformity. The latter phenomenon can be seen at present: despite tremendous growth in population (heading towards the six-billion mark), there is more and more overall uniformity in the cultures and languages of today. The following Figures (5.1 through 5.4) are meant to refer to the problem of "tree-bound reconstruction". Fig. 5.1 deals with the 16 or 17 language families as reported on by RUHLEN (1987: 258). These families are seen to be the result of both language typology and genealogy. This is why they may also be looked upon as representing the seventeen Proto-Languages which possibly existed at the beginning of the postglacial, neolithic periods. Long-distance reconstruction sets in here (SHEVOROSHKIN (ed.) 1989 Reconstructing, Explorations; SHEVOROSHKIN 1990); it tries to reconstrue, for the preceding millenia, i.e. for the peak of the Würm III glaciation, those proto-protolanguages which are supposed to have been more or less uniform linguistic areas. We thus arrive at about seven macrophvla Fig. 5.1 may show the probable distribution of the 17 phyla and the 7 macrophyla - from which the former are thought to have sprung. It is the distribution of the transitional time of ca. 12-14 kya. Fig. 5.1 is - in more than one way - superficial (for instance, "Caucasian" should really be split into North-Caucasian (NCA) and South-Caucasian (SCA) - Kartvelian -; then only NCA is said to form part of the macrophylum "Dene-Caucasian", while SCA is assumed to be part of Nostratic). The main disadvantage of Fig. 5.1 is its character of snapshot. A more time-dynamic view is attempted in Shevoroshkin's World Languages Tree (Fig. 5.2). But here we are not expressly told how the time-axis (bottom-up) proceeds. If, e.g., Khoisan is assumed to have been the first split about 40 kya and Niger-Nilotic ca. 35 kya, the separation of Eurasian languages and Austnc-Australian languages should come relatively late, namely (if the tree is meant to be roughly drawn to scale), ca. 25 kya. And Australian itself should then be seen as dating from ca. 15 kya. Are we supposed to assume that the early Australians (near Keilor or Lake Mungo, 45 kya), whose contacts with the rest of the world were certainly no better than 30 kya later, were speaking a more uniform language which connected them intimately with all the other humans on our globe, especially with people all over Asia and Europe? It is obvious that the palaeogeographic inroads we made into the past - inspiring though they might be - still lack a multidimensional component. The big-bang idea of human monogenesis in terms both of genes and of languages is, unfortunately, still prevailing. But perhaps we should be more patient. We may have to start with tree-diagram views
31

which will later become necessarily modified. Thus, despite many a piece of reasonable criticism levelled against it (BATEMAN et al. 1990), L.L. CAVALLI-SFORZA's attempt at correlating population groups of the Würm glaciation and its reconstructed lingual macrophyla (Fig. 5.3) may be a source to further inspiration and even for real facts coming to the fore. Noone expects genes and languages to be unequivocably correlated but then noone should be surprised if there is some correlation after all. The latter phenomenon seems to be exhibited by Fig. 5.3. A mild reminder of the fact that there is not only progressive and correlative differentiation of genes and languages, but also admixture, superstratum, substratum, unification etc. is to be seen in the non-correlative items of Fig. 5.3. Thus, Ethiopian, though here definitely "African" (near "Khoisan") in genes, is conspicuously Afro-Asiatic in language. Similar relationships seem to hold for Melanesian or Tibetan. Thus again: Fig. 5.3 is fine - as long as we see it as a still taken from an integral film. A simple, yet significant approach to multiplication of snapshots is made by André LANGANEY (Fig. 5.4). He suggests that the human populations during the entire Würm period were already distributed and relatively diversified. Geographic-genetic bottlenecks (Gibraltar, Sinai), especially during peaks of glaciation: Caspian-Sea, Pamir-Himalayan bottlenecks, tended to temporarily hamper intercommunication. But there probably were no entirely closed gene/language systems at any time. Relative closure and relative openness in systems, changes in environment and population, kept influencing what already was a highly diversified landscape. This had come to pass from the very beginning of Würm, 100,000 ya. Not only because of this is the idea of progressive decrease in differentiation in progressively earlier periods (as also to be seen in Fig. 5.4) one that carries little a limine conviction. Thus, we should put in a plea for constantly calling to mind all the mechanisms that may run counter to the exclusive idea of progressive differentiation. There always is some probability for admixture, waves, polygenesis, and convergence, too. Monogenetic "trees" often are mere ideals of metagenetic simplicity.

Genetic and Metagenetic Reconstruction
6. Genetic and Metagenetic Reconstruction: A Mosaic
Reconstruction cannot properly work without countercurrent strategies. The main reason for this is that reality itself is polarly constructed on all levels of its systems. Fig. 6 is a collage or superimposition of four different models. First, we have a fragment of a cosmological model, second an extract of a glottogenetic model (cf. Fig. 2.1), third the model of echogenesis (cf. "window" 6a), and fourth a simplified model for language change (6b). Although several comprehensive views on language change have been proposed (cf., e.g., LUDTKE (ed.) 1979, HOCK 1986, BYNON 1977, HOENIGSWALD, WIENER (eds.) 1987), we still need more information about many parameters of change: e.g. the time-ratio for language becoming unintellegible to itself or non-reconstructible, respectively (e.g. DECSY 1987, BENDER 1973), time-ratios and networks/fields of (progressive) semantic and/or phonetic change (e.g. HAGEGE, HAUDRICOURT 1978, GROLIER 1981/1989), time-ratios for lexical change (e.g. LEES 1953; SWADESH 1955, DOLGOPOLSKY 1986), tableaus of long-term directionality of language change in general (e.g. HAGEGE 1985, DRESSLER 1987, MAYERTHALER 1981, BICHAKJIAN 1988) etc. etc. And we need countercurrent formats of theories, too. Thus while we would be one-eyed if we viewed cosmogenesis from the sole point-of-vantage of "SLS" (i.e. of increasing negentropy or "complexation" in systems, cf. KOCH 1991 dawn, appendix) - thus ignoring "SLT" (the "Second Law of Thermodynamics", i.e. entropy), we would equally espouse an extremely biassed view of language evolution if we considered change as mainly or exclusively heading in one direction: complexation or (as, for instance, BICHAKJIAN 1988 is suggesting) simplification. The lesson to be leamt from phenomena of echogenesis (Fig. 6a again, more details in KOCH 1991 dawn) and of change in general (Fig. 6b) is, it seems to me, that, despite some overall unidirectional tendencies in the latter 100,000 years of glottogenesis (cf. Fig. 2.1), there is a high amount of recurrent and countercurrent tendencies (circular or "pendular" systemic trends as indicated by bidirectional arrows in Fig. 6) which will have to be elaborated on in the future.
7. Some Queries Concerning the Mosaic
I can here, of course, only speak for myself. The participants of the symposium will, at least in part, develop views that may differ from each other and from my suggestions. Nevertheless, I assume that, as far as the temporal-structural outlines of the preceding paragraphs go, we will share a recognizable common territory. Thus I expect that the symposium and,
43



Some Queries
consequently, the various contributions to the present collection of essays may shed some light on the queries I have brought up (cf. Fig. 7). No contribution ought to be seen as an "island in itself but rather as a small chip of the eco-puzzle which we have been suggesting (cf. §§ 2f.). And while we cannot talk about the language of Neanderthals or of Cro-Magnon people without the framework of a more comprehensive glottogenesis, our focus will be narrowing down on the WiirmLanguage (WL). Yet even on this behalf we need the view of an eco-mosaic (cf. Fig. 7).

into words and what processes govern the selection and combin ation of phonemes into words related Io objects or actions? If the existence of distinct phonemes as is here suggested is a by-product of the oigairizrilion of the motor system, then one would expect that parallel to the vaiiety of distinct elementary movements which vertebrates and humans can perform, there would be a $ct of distinct phonemes Looked at from the opposite direction, assuming that lire phoneme-sets lor many languages are in (he range of forty to sixty, then this would imply the existence of at least forty-sixty distinct elementary units of motor action, forty-sixty partial movements or positions of the limbs which can Ire matched with (he array of phonemes. I'hc hier archical structure of the motor system would be built err the basis of a limited set of motor elements, which could be combined in an unlimited number of different ways (motor-words), just as phon emes can fotm an unlimited number of spoken words It becomes relevant to seek to observe and analyse into their elementary components the range of bodily actions that (he human, or indeed the rhesus monkey or the chinchilla, can perform. If, as Kimura has suggested, there is in fact a special neural relation between speech and movements of the upper limb, one can concentrate first on analysis of human, or monkey, arm move ments. The essence of a motor element, a motor sub-routine, for the atm is that it can be referred Io a particular musclc/joinl complex operating in a specific co-ordinate system formed from the vertical and horizontal co-ordinates of the body. For elemen tary movements, the human or monkey arm can move forward and up, sideways across the body or it can be bent and moved up in front of (he body. In these movements there is a succession of positions which could be correlated with the set of articulatory paltcrnings requited Io produce the range of phonemes, using the musculature of the vocal apparatus. I he specificity of the phon eme is the accidental result ol the application of the dilfcrent elementary motor subprograms to (he muscles which went to form the articulatory system, livery phoneme is <orrclatcd with a par ticular position or movement ol the arm; each phoneme is the result of a distinct motor subprogram which specifics (he degree of contraction in a complex of muscles, the tension and the balancing forces deter milling the position assumed by the limb or the trajectory of the limb movement.

group controlling arm position or set the biases between agonist and antagonist muscles which determine position. What we are concerned with is the existence of a motor-alphabet underlying all complex bodily action which has been given a particular application, interpretation and external expression by being redirected to the special set of muscles involved in articulation. Gesture is the most obvious demonstration of the parallel expression of motor programs in speech and bodily action. As McNeill has repeatedly pointed out, 'The omnipresence of con crete sensorimotor ideas in speech is a phenomenon that has received almost no attention from linguists or psychologists’ (McNeill 1979: 3). The translation of speech motor-programs into skeletal motor programs has been demonstrated in human beings (gesture and synchronized movement). But we are faced with the question: Where do the specific forms of words come from, if, as is suggested in the motor theory advanced here, the components of words, phonemes, are derived from the elemen tary motor programs for bodily action? Words are a read-out of neural structures in much the same way as actions or facial expressions are a read-out of internal states, thought and feeling processes. Logically prior to the meaning of a word is its physical manifestation as a unit of neuromuscular action in the speaker and as an event in the listener (Swinney 1981: 303). A set of signals in the optic nerve represents the presence of a cup in the visual field. In each case certain groups of cortical nerve cells will be activated. This is J.Z. Young’s (1978: 73) account of perception as related to individual words. Before we speak a word we have the impression from introspection that some process of ‘mental’ organization occurs before the movements of a response begin and the preparations are by no means confined to the first movement of the contem plated response. (To type the word ‘contemplated’ we do not have the pure idea of pressing the ‘c’ and then waiting to see what movement will appear next, as the Markov-chaining theory would predict). Somewhere in the nervous system there is an activity corresponding to the whole word and beyond that in all probability a still higher order of activity corresponding to the meaning that is to be conveyed by the sentence in which the word appears (Milner 1970: 92). If one accepts that the distinct phonemes found in the world’s different languages were an accidental product of the set of

1-3.2 Towards a theory of linguistic paedomorphosis
Since “paedomorphosis played a central role in human evolution” (Gould, 19776:364), since articulated language is a species-specific feature of man, and moreover since there are good reasons to believe that language acquisition is genetically controlled—perhaps in a manner comparable with the regulation of structural genes—it seems logical to pursue matters one step further and investigate whether language evolution is not produced by a changing rate of language acquisition. By slowing down the rate of language acquisition, the regulatory genes would make languages evolve towards ever more paedomorphic features. Just as it was pointed out that man is not an infantile ape, it is not suggested that Modern English, for instance, is Indo-European baby-talk, but that languages evolve through a steady process whereby late-acquired features are repeatedly eliminated and replaced with ever-earlier-acquired ones (cf eg. the earlier-acquired Lat. f replacing the later-acquired I.E. ¿h). An investigation of the above-mentioned process cannot be conducted in full: gene regulation is still not adequate!) understood and the biological correlates of language remain putative. Nevertheless, we might recall that the heliocentricity of the universe was established long before the launching of the first interplanetary rocket, and that Saussure posited his “coefficients sonantiques” before Hittite provided the necessary empirical support. Hence the present endeavor, but also the full awareness that it cannot prove, but only suggest, that language evolution is produced b\ the retardatory action of man’s regulatory genes. The investigation will proceed along the following steps. Chapter two will present and compare some of the theories on the evolution of species and of man in particular. Chapter three « ill tn tempt to show that there are good reasons for thinking that man’s faculté de langage has cellular correlates, and that the acquisition of language is a genetically regulated development. Chapter four will be devoted to language acquisition: Jakobson's seminal work (1941/68) will be discussed in the light of the observations to which it has given rise. Chapters five, six, and seven will take up the evolution of phonology, morphology and s ynlax, । espectively, and will attempt to show that the Indo-European languages have evolved in the direction of earlieracquired speech sounds and grammatical features. Since the lexica of languages do not lend themselves to systematic study, and since new words ar- acquired throughout the speaker's lifetime, the evolution of the lexical items will not be discussed, although some of them may very well display a paedomorphic history. The concluding chapter will stress that, while the data clearly show that the Indo-European languages have evolved or are evolving by eliminating late-acquired features and by replacing them with earlier acquired ones, it can only be inferred that the evolution of languages is produced by a change in the regulation of the genetic elements that are responsible for the acquisition of human speech. The conclusion will no doubt be putative, but the present work will, it is hoped, define the direction of language evolution in terms of a clear and quantitatively verifiable criterion and suggest a logical explanation. Obviously, the conclusive argument will have to come from geneticists and molecular biologists.

ON LANGUAGE ORIGINS
However, laterality was probably not only connected with the performance of complex sequenced movements with the upper limbs, but also with the production of complex se quenced articulatory movements, i.e. the interspersing of consonant-like sounds between the inherited vowel-like voca lizations. Originally this was probably only a more or less epiphenomenal ability, just enriching the available behavi oural repertoire, Including the repertoire of signals.
Yet, as articulate sequences of vowel- and consonant-like sounds allow a much more concise and accurate transmission of memory elements than the complex inherited communication system as a whole, it can easily be assumed that these se quences little by little gained a central position within this system, at the expense of its other elements, or, as Jane H. HILL puts it, "the 'language' system, heavily depen dent on sound production," has been overlaid "on top of ol der display systems involving simpler types of sound produc tion and visual and tactile displays" (1972:311).
Ronald E. MYERS distinguishes between three different theo ries concerning the relationship between animal vocalizations
and human speech:
gradual evolution of animal vocal responses
into speech (e.g. HOCKETT), origination of human speech not from animal
vocalizations, but from gestures (e.g. HEWES), de novo origin of speech.
MYERS himself pleads for the last hypothesis (1978:62s.). Ne vertheless, it seems that things have been more complicated: although it may well be that human vowels originated from animal vocalizations, it appears that (most) consonants
evolved de novo and that human speech, characterized by ra pid sequences of more or less inherited vowels and more or less newly created consonants, developed within a more com plex signal system (including gestures) and, little by litt¡e, replaced its other elements or was overlaid on top of them.

CONSONANTS AND COGNITTON
When these sequences had assumed the function of convey ing pieces of knowledge from one individual to the other, the two strands discussed in this chapter had combined to form the true precursor of modern human language.
It is, of course, difficult to say when this happened, but in any event it is by no means cogent to follow Philip LIEBERMAN in his contention that for reasons concerning the development of the vocal tract (see WIND 1970, 1976) speech could not have begun before the period of Borno tapitnt tap-iens (LIEBERMAN / CRELIN / KLATT 1972, LIEBERMAN 1984: 316-324). His results are not uncontroverslal (cf. DU BRUL 1977, SPUHLER 1977:546s., STEKLIS / RALEIGH 1979:290-293), but even if they were correct they would not be as decisive as he claims. His main argument is that a vocal tract like that of Neanderthal or chimpanzee does not permit the pro duction of certain vowels that help the hearer to calibrate the speaker's voice (1984:146-168). Nevertheless, his fi gures (1984:161) show that this is only a matter of degree, and in relatively small groups whose members know each other
from birth voice calibrating presumably does not have the
·,
same importance as in the big modern societies . In any case, I would not be surprised if already Bomo habilit pro duced and processed vocalizations articulated by consonants in order to transmit elements of memory (COPPENS 1983:118120; following SEITELBERGER, this stage had already been
reached by the Australopithecines, 1983:127).

11. Symbolism
Many — perhaps most — sorts of symbolic behaviour do not leave physical traces in archaeological remains: tattooing and body painting, dances, songs, rituals (including a large part of funeral rites; see Guiart, 1986:5) and, of course, speech. Drawings or writings on perishable mate rials could survive only in rarely encountered favourable conditions: few Easier Island tablets have been preserved, and none of the first Chinese books written on wooden plates. Besides, symbolic practices like ritual can nibalism can rarely be detected by unambiguous proofs — see the recurrent controversy on the Zhoukoudian and other mutilated skulls (Eliade, 1980:19-20, Leroi-Gourhan, 1983:41-52, Camps, 1982:377-383, Coppens, 1983:134). The only undisputed mark of a truly ritual practice so far seems Io be the traces of scalping on the Bodo skull (found at Hadar, considered as intermediary between ereclus and sapiens, but unfortunately not pre cisely dated). Since the years 1898-1913, when Thieullen and Dharvent introduced the idea that Acheulean humans retouched stones to form anthropomor phic and zoomorphic shapes, which they called “pierres-figures'", profes sional prehistorians have remained unwilling to admit the existence of any attempt at sculpture before the Aurignacian (Vngelherd, Hohlenstein Stadel, around 0.03 mya): three-dimensional art could not have preceded two-dimensional representations. At the 1st International Congress of Human Palaeontology (Nice, 1982) laughter and hisses were the response of the audience to the presentation of Gaietto's paper on this subject. Ercoie (1976, 1985) has collected ca. 4000 stones, which she believes Io have been retouched by prehistoric men from the Mousterian to the Epipalaeolilhic, mainly from Corsica, but also from other Mediterranean countries, France, and even Iceland. She also used an earlier find by Biberson (1961) from Morocco for hypothesizing an Acheulean origin of these early sculptures. However, all of Ercole's stones have been found in surface sites, and they lack datations; according to E. Bonifay, responsible for the archaeological sites in Corsica (personal communication) many of them are considered as without human retouches. But nt least a number of the speci mens in Ercole's collections are rather strikingly similar to other, less debatable pieces, and it would be desirable to submit them to detailed sci entific investigation. We could express the same desideratum concerning the scries of some 700 pebbles found near Oujda (Morocco), provisionally dated ca. 0.015 mya and interpreted by their discoverer, Fleury (1985) as anthropomorphic/zoomorphic smoothing-tools. A most interesting finding has been reported by Sohn (¡987): a scries of representations of human figures on bones found in Korean caves, dated 0.066 mya, which he compared to similar figures in the Henri-Martin's col lection from Fontéchevade deposited at the Musée des antiquités nationales (St. Germain, near Paris) of which only one specimen was described, and which could be dated earlier than 0.15 mya. between 70.000 and 50,000 years ago". Velo (1986), though admitting ear lier dates, thinks that the early utilization of red ochre was mainly non-symbolic, as “a healing or medicinal agent'*.' Oosthuizen (1979) conjectures that red ochre mining might have occurred in southern Africa before 0.04 mya. the ochre being used for medicinal, cosmetic, or religious purposes. But Dart (1968) emphasized its relation to symbolic behaviour. In the recent hunter-gatherer culture of the Selk'nam (disintegrated about 1933), red ochre was mainly used (or body painting (mixed with grease) and as protec tion against wind and cold, as well as (or aesthetic and symbolic (ritual) reasons. It also served to decorate their guanaco skins (Chapman, 1983:49, 51, 55-56, 114, 150). lite Oropoin people — a San tribe, apparently now

considered ns n West European invention (Conkey, 1983) despite the fact that newly found rock art specimens from Tanzania have been dated at ca. 0.04 mya (Anati, 1985). 1 will not enter into details of this field of research, which would neces sitate writing a separate paper. Let us only remark, with Vialou (1987:6203), that in fact the Upper Palaeolithic art , "in spite of its apparent realism, due to the animal representations" is abstract. Its symbolic founda tion is proved by the absence of "objective figurative quality in the human representations” and by the wealth of abstract signs, generally organized in series; the most complex signs appear to be restiicted to a local culture, but the elementary ones show a wide distribution, and form a continuation of the signs incised on bones found at Pech de I'Azi (date debated: 0.2 mya according to Bordes, 1969), Bilzingsleben, ca. 0.3-0.25 myn (Mania and VRek, 1987) and at La Chaise (about 0.2 mya: Dcbdnatli, 1982:911-912). (See also below, }14, for ideas on Palaeolithic art in relation to demo graphic structures, and J16 for its relation to early writing systems). In her paper for the Nice Congress (1982), Botscharow cited some cases for symbolic behaviour in later Acheulean sites, including the quartz crystals collected by the ¿houkoudian people and the fossilized sea-urchin flaked at Swanscombe. At Singi Talav (India), in a site dated ca. 0.4-0.2 mya, quartz crystals have been found, two of them having been apparently collected for non-utilitarran attention (D'Errico, Gaillard and Misra, 1987). But it must be noted that such evidence appears to have become less excep tional in the Mousterian agi: see, for instance, the mammoth ivory plate and the fossil nummulite with an incised cross on one surface found al Tata (Hungary) and dated at ca. 0.1 mya. Related to symbolism, art and "religious” thinking is the problem of the use of red ochre (and of pigments in general) during the Palaeolithic. Wreschner (1982, 1983) was sceptical about the alleged presence of red ochre at Olduvai (ca. 0.5 mya), at Terra Amata (supposedly occupied by humans since about 0.38 mya; but (he red ochre strata could be more recent, perhaps 0.23), and at Ambrona and Beiov (which he dates about 0.25 mya). He did not mention the Melka Kunturi find, ca. 0.4 mya, so that he did not accept that ochre was used symbolically before "somewhere extinct, from Uganda — ’applied a mixture of oil and ochre Io the hair and body" (Wilson, 1970:133). For the symbolic connotations of Greek and Latin words referring to ochre, see Alinei (1981). Then, there are the pyramidal heaps of stones, of which up to now we have two examples from the African Middle Stone Age, unfortunately imprecisely dated: one at El Gucttar (Tunisia) and another at Windhoek (Namibia) (Gruct, 1955) and a third one in France (Arcy-sur-Curc) dated ca. 0.034 mya (Leroi-Gourhan, 1983:23-24, 74). Gruct, the discoverer of Fl Guettar, referred to many similar cairns from various cultures since the Neolithic. He did not, however, mention the Klioisan so-called "llcitsi Eibib graves” found all over South Africa (Schapera, 1930:384-386); Jef freys (1968:18, 21) erroneously considered them as confirming his theory of “Semitic influences on Hottentot culture", arguing that such monuments are described in Arabia and among the ancient Jews. 1 have pointed out the .special interest of these cairns, particularly from the linguistic point of view, in a previous paper (1985:4, 65). See also Sutton (1973) for burial cairns in Kenya. To most specialists, "art” properly speaking, defined as “image mak ing" — a sharp distinction being made between “non-represcntational' signs and notations and "representational" images (Davis, 1986) — did not arise earlier than the Chatelperronian, ca. 0.034 mya, and it is still generally

But let us return to Nostratic. Since there were no words for cultivated plants in Nostratic, one may suppose that the "Nostrates" gathered plants and used them for food but did not cultivate any. Nostratic also had no words for domesticated animals. Thus, in the Up per Old Stone Age (around 15,000 B.C.), the Nostrates were apparently hunters, not cattlemen. ./»Nostratic has the same word for both the wolf and the dog, kujna, which came to be applied more to the dog in Indo-European languages and to the wolf in most other Nostratic offspring. In Indo-European, kudn was 'dog,* and the genitive form was kun-es; in Uralic kiijna 'wolf'; Afro-Asi atic kjn 'wolf, dog'; Latin canis 'dog'; French chienne, German hund and English hound; in Cel tic the archaic meaning for 'wolf' can be traced in ceil and genitive con, a 'destroyer of cattle' or 'monster'. This linguistic information indicates that the speakers of Nostratic were beginning to domesti cate wolves, gradually transforming these wild animals into dogs, making friends of foes. A few more Nostratic roots may illustrate cer tain phonetic laws of these languages, the general patterns for shifts in the typical sounds that make up words: If in the eastern Nostratic languages a 'u' follows a k,' then western languages obtain the consonant blend 'kw' or a similar compound
with a consonant and 'w'. Again, in the Indo-Eu ropean, the Nostratic 'k' as in 'cut' becomes a hard 'g* or voiced sound, as in 'gut'. The Nostratic kuni ('wife' or 'woman') becomes in the Afro-Asiatic languages KwVn ('one of the wives', 'woman'). (The capital 'K' here and in other examples symbolizes a glottal sound — one

made in the bach of the oral cavity, at the vocal chords, and the 'V* symbolizes a vowel whose sound is undetermined, so the word is pro nounced something like 'kwen'.) In the Indo-Eu ropean, kuni becomes gwen ('wife', 'woman'), with the vowel 'e' expected here — a word that carried over into Middle English and whose root
is still present in the English tfueen. Tire vowels in Altaic, the mother of Mongolian, more closely reflect the older forms than do those
in the western group, as in kiint one of the wives'. Students and followers of llliC-S«it yd and Dolgopolskv are at work both on the further recon struction of Nostratic and on the reconstruction of another proto-proto-language called Sino-Caucasian or Dene-Caucasian. This macro-famuy com prises the North Caucasian (Abkhazian. Chechen, Kabardian and many languages in Daghestan); Sino-Tibetan (Mandarin, Cantonese and other Chinese tongues, also Burmese and Ti betan); Yeniseyan (spoken in eastern Siberia) and Na-Dene languages (including the Apache, Navajo, Chippewayan and other Athapascan lan guage^ of Western North America, and Tlingit, spoken by the seafaring 'American Indians’ of southern Alaska and British Columbia). According to their research, there was in Asia a foundation language that broke up into the North Caucasian, Yeniseyan, Sino-Tibetan (which in cludes Chinese) and Na-Dene languages. The speakers of Na-Dene migrated to North America and became the Northwest American 'Indians.' Like Nostratic, the Dene Caucasian proto· proto language existed about 14,000 years ago. TTic famous American linguist Joseph Green berg, of Stanford University, identified a few years ago a further proto-proto-language, though he made only a preliminary reconstruction of it. fie named this foundation language Amerind. To this macro-family of languages belong most tongues of the Americas: the Penutian languages
in California and Oregon, theTi’okan languages in the American Southwest, the Uto-Aztecan lan guages of New Mexico and Mexico, and many Central and South American languages as well. Greenberg's book on this subject. Language in the Americas, will appear this fall.)

Appendix
Long before any speakers of Indo-European
languages came to this hemisphere, then, the Amerind macro-family existed in the Americas the languages in the north of the hemisphere be longing to the Dene-Caucasian macro-family that also includes languages in northeastern Asia and that segment of the Nostratic grouping that in eludes Eskimo-Aleutian.
But are these three large macro-families, the Nostratic, Dene-Caucasian and Amerind, genet ically related to one another? Ivanov and other comparativists believe not only that these three linguistic proto-proto-lan guage families are related, but that the others are as well, through what may be called a protoproto-proto language spoken 25,000 years ago. To reconstruct such a language would require com parison of many of the stablest words whose roots bear similarities in the Amerind, Dene-Cau casian and Nostratic linguistic families, and in other languages of the Earth. There are many tentative comparisons between the proto-proto-families. Tire words for 'fog' in the forerunner of the Athapascan Native Ameri can language is KVni (globalized 'k', an undeter mined vowel then'm') and in North Caucasian it is KKwomV. The words for 'foot' in these two lan guages are Tah and TwehwV, respectively. Amer ind has kuna for 'woman', which is close to the Nostratic kuni. And the Nostratic mVno and mono for 'man', 'husband' or 'master' is almost identi cal to the Amerind main) 'husband'. A chief task for linguists now is to identify other large linguistic families, to reconstruct their remote ancestors and then to begin a svstematic comparison of all stable roots. For example, Indo European ey/io becomes German idi, English / and Old Russian az. Computers will provide tremendous assistance to any researcher attempting to build the still-un reconstructed other sister proto-proto languages of Nostratic. In addition to Dene-Caucasian and Amerind, these include: — the macro-Asiatic language that gave rise to Polynesian, Thai, Micronesian, Tagalog, Khmer, Vietnamese and numerous other languages, — the mother languages of the New Guinea and Australian tongues — and what seems to be the oldest of all lin guistic families, the Khoisan, which often em ploys clicks made in the back of the throat (Hatsa,

Sandawe, "Bushman" and "Hottentot" languages of southern and eastern Africa). Much also remains to be done on African lan guages that seem to belong to the Nostratic fam ily, including the Niger-Kordofanian family of south and central Africa (Swahili, Zulu, Congo and other Bantu languages, and also Fulani, Ash anti, Mande and Kwa); and the Nilo-Saharan family (Saharan, Dinka, Efe, the Songhai lan guage of Mali and languages spoken in parts of Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Zaire, Uganda, Cam eroon and Tanzania). The thesis that all languages are related through a single language spoken in the farthest prehistoric past is persuasive and by now sup ported by linguistic research. It effectively refutes the long-held notion that many of the world's lin guistic families stand in no genetic relationship to each other, a view like the pre-Darwinian as sumption that humans, animals and other crea tures were distinct and unrelated. We must stop speaking about the "unrelated ness" of languages and start to describe the de gree of reiatedness. Recovering ancestral languages spoken in the remote past will give us the key to many central issues about the origin, development and diffusion of peoples, cultures and humankind itself.

Methods in Interphyletic Comparisons
By V. Shevoroshkin (Ann Arbor. Michigan)
I. NOSTRATIC
The Danish linguist Holger Pedersen stated in a review in 1903: “There is no doubt that many language families are related to Indo-European..."; thereafter he proposed the term “Nostratic languages' for I[ndo-]E[ropean], L'r(alic], Alt(aic] and Semito-Hamitic (= Aflro-]As(iatic] in modem termi nology)—languages he considered to be remotely related. PEDERSEN was aware of the fact that it is necessary to limit the investigation of this kind of remote relationship to a certain amount of stable roots/forms which never or seldom become subject of borrowing from language to language: “We should limit ourselves to a rational review of pronouns and negational forms, including in part the numerals which can be traced through a number of language families" (ZDMG vol. 57, p. 560; in German. The above translation by J. R. Krueger has been taken from the reference book "Global Linguistic Connections.” Eurolingua. Bloomington 1983. p. 82). Pedersen’s statement appears to have special significance in the lighr of A. Dolgopolsky's study on the methodology of comparisons of distinatly related languages (Dolgopolsky 1986: translation from a paper written in Russian in 1964). He set up a list of the “universally stablest words"; such words only seldom (if ever) undergo replacements by new words of the same language. In Dolgopolsky’s view the following units display the highest degree of stability: personal pronouns (1st and 2nd person); inter rogative pronoun(s); negational and prohibitive forms. Nevertheless, there are words in the hierarchy of stability revealed by Dolgopolsky which are more stable than negational forms, belonging, at the same time, to the list of full-lexemes: a few designations of body parts (’tongue', ’eye’, ’heart', ’tooth/teeth'), as well as the word ’name'. We note that in the sequence of the 15 next-stablest words we find no grammatical units: all are full-lexemes: •fingemail/toenail', ’louse' (which meaning may change to ’flea’), ‘tear (in eye)’ ’water’, ’dead', ‘nit’, ’moon’, ’hand', ‘night’, ‘blood’, ’horn', ’full’, ’sun’, ’ear’, ’salt’ (Dolgopolsky 1986. 33-35; Shevoroshkin 1986. XVIII). It is remarkable that among these all-stablest words there are no verbs: evolutionarily, verbal notions might be secondary. Pedersen’s restriction might be useful as the very first step of an analysis to determine if certain languages are (remotely) related; but we must take

into consideration that the “Nostratic languages' as a unity (phylum, macro family) contain, even among all-stablest words, many lexical units -(roots) which appear in “non-Nostractic languages' as well: this might indicate the next, even deeper, degree of i elationship—that among more remote phyla. For instance, most Nostratic daughter-languages (Indo-European. Uralic. Kartvelian. etc.: see below) contain the pronoun T in the form 'me or *mi. but this pronoun can be found also in Amerind (Greenberg 1987.276) and other phyla: Tibeto-Burman ‘lap ’leaf is almost identical with the Nostractic word for leaf (present in Engl, leaf) which, as correctly noticed by Helimsku 1984.40. does not necessarily mean that Tibeto-Burman is a Nostratic language: indeed, this word, in a more archaic shape * X’ap'-. appears both in NorthCaucasian and in Amerind (as in Penutian: Yokuts *t'7dap·.: cf. Greenberg 1987.153-154. No. I39).-etc. The most successful adherents of Pedersen, scholars whose works are free, or almost free, of serious mistakes and internal contradictions (like B. COLLINDER. K. MENGES. N. POPPE). compared IE. Ur. Alt and other languages using not just a handful of forms but a rather large amount (several hundred) of basic words; any serious critic would agree that the vast majority of these words were not borrowings: they were inherited in each language in question. Relying on the comparisons of these scholars and offering many new data, two Muscovite scholars. V. IlliC-SvttyC and B. DOLGOPOLSKY, have recon structed in the early sixties (basically, independently from each other) the Nostratic proto-language, correctly anticipated by "PEDERSEN six decades earlier. IlliC-SvttyC used known reconstructions of IE. Ur, Kartv(elian) (Proto-Kartv had been reconstructed by G. Klimov shortly before), as well as his own reconstructions of Altaic. Drav(idian) and AfAs. Initially, DOLGOPOLSKY did not consider Drav languages (but started to do so later); he did not reconstruct Altaic, but operated with three Altaic proto-units (Turkic. Tungusian. Mongolian), considering them as direct sub-branches of Proto-Nostratic: both scholars considered Korean and Japanese as Altaic languages as well. Their earliest publications on the topic appeared in 1964 (see Bibliography below). Later on. DOLGOPOLSKY published his own results on Nostratics in the Russian series “Etimologija*; he also found time to prepare for publication two first volumes of the Nostratic dictionary of IlliCSvrTYC who died as a result of a tragic accident in 1966. Both volumes of the dictionary have received high marks in V. Ivanov’s reviews (see trans lations of both reviews in Typology... 1966. 51-56 and 57-65. respectively); both volumes, as well as the first part of the third volume have been expertly edited by V. Dybo-IlliC-SvityC's friend and an excellent comparatist himself (see I.-S. 1971, 1976 and 1984 in the Bibliography). The results of Nostratic reconstructions achieved by IlliC-SvityC and DOLGOLPOSKY independently are due to the thorough knowledge of languages involved: they display precise comparisons, outstanding linguistic intuition and also the ability to deal with a large number of languages simultaneously

EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF HUMAN SPEECH ORGANS
Diagrammatic representation of a number of processes that during primate evolution
are likely to have contributed to the origin and evolution of speech. This reconstruction
shows that speech emergence must have been the result of a large number of different
evolutionary processes that virtually completely cover the whole course of hominization.
(From Wind. 1983).



Appendix
So, what can we conclude from this thought experiment'’ Though the encoding and decoding speeds may be different, all these humans may be assumed to be using language by means of sound signals. What they all have in common is the central nervous system’s capacity and propensity for decoding and encoding signals from and for fellow humans, and for proces sing them, thereby establishing the communication system that we call lan guage (the characters of which need not to be discussed here having ably been treated by others, also in this volume). Whether speaking softly or loudly, whether using a clear or a harsh voice, whether using more or fewer distinctive sounds, whether having undergone tooth extraction or a laryngectomy, and so on, the average human is able — if not driven — to communicate by voice with other humans, the underlying system being called language. This system also operates when other véhicula are used such as in written or gestural communication. fh< only ess nt tai differences between the various communication modes are to be found in the encoding and decoding speeds. Even if the most recent prespeech hominids and the earliest speaking hominids still possessed an ape-like vocal tract, their potential encoding speed is likely to have been about similar to ours. Their actual encoding and decoding speeds must have been determined entirely by the properties of their nervous system (like cognition). In view of the evidence from evolutionary biology in general, it is likely that during the evolution from nonhuman primates to man there have been mutual feed-back forces shap ing the morphology and the physiology of the vocal tract and the central nervous system. I presume, however, that these forces have been relatively weak because the vocal tract, like the auditory system for that matter, is like ly to have been already preadapted for speech in our prehominid ancestors. Interestingly, over the last decades language-like abilities have been shown to be present in apes (Hayes, 1951; Gardner and Gardner, 1969; Touts, 1972, 1973; Premack and Premack, 1972; Rensch, 1968; Rumbaugh, Gill and von Glasersfeld, 1973; Menzel and Halperin, 1975; Miles, 1983). The apes appear to use mainly the brain —» limbs/face channel rather than the brain —» vocal tract channel. My comparative observations suggest that the fact that the apes leave their vocal tract idle cannot be explained by the tract's inadequacy but rather by a lack of internal, cerebral, wiring. And rather than vocal tract novelties, it appears that cerebral reorganization has been decisive for the origin of speech-like communication, such as an increased ability to form cross-modal associations (Geschwind, 1964) and an increased memory. In addition to this and the vocal-tract preadaptations discussed above, there must have been many other adaptations and their interactions that have contributed to the emergence of speech during pri mate evolution as schematically pictured in Fig. 4 (cf. also Wind, 1970; 1983). Hence, when we want to assess the role of the peripheral vocal organs in the emergence of speech, wc have to investigate which encoding speed fits into the picture that wc are now able to reconstruct for ancestral pri mates, including their behaviour and the selective pressures that shaped them.
