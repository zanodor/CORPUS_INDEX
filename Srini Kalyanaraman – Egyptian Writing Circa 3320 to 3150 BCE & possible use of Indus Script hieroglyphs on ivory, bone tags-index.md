[quote]Quite recently, moreover, small tags of bone and ivory, about postage-stamp size, have been discovered on which are carved symbols that, in some cases, bear similarity to later-known hieroglyphs. These have been dated to around 3400–3200 BC by the German archaeologist, Günter Dreyer, who discovered them, and the symbols have been interpreted by Dreyer as writing. The dating of the tags and, perhaps more crucially, the interpretation of their markings as writing requires further investigation.[unquote]-Writing Systems R.D.

"In 1988 Dreyer and his colleague Werner Kaiser excavated in Abydos (Umm el-Qaab) on the cemetery "U" the burial site of the king (U-j), which is dated to the Naquada period IIIa2, known as king Scorpion I. Currently, this is the earliest known large royal tomb of old Egypt. The most important finds were about 400 large wine jars being inscribed resp. having tags showing phonetically readable characters of a script, the first of its kind in Egypt. They identify the person laid into the grave, as the inscription says "plantation of (king) Scorpion." Script also name his successor, a king Double Falcon I. The scientific importance lies in the fact of finding Egyptian hieroglyphs which predate cuneiform script. The mentioned hierogylphs are on small wooden tags applied to the jars probably marking their origin and "are fully developed", as Dreyer stated. In 1998 Dreyer found another writing on small ivory labels, he concluded that these support the challenge to the prevailing view that the first people to write were the Sumerians of Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) sometime before 3000 BCE" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/235724.stm

Axes of copper were status symbols in the First Dynasty. Several were found with retainers buried around the king's funerary temples, who may have served as special guards. On this axe an inscription includes a drawing of an elephant, probably giving the name of the owner, but the reading is uncertain.Broad rectangular axe-head with concave butt and gently convex sides, which turn out slightly at the corners of the cutting edge. As one of the sides is more convex and shorter than the other, the cutting end, which is moderately convex, is a little lop-sided. The blade has been cleaned since its acquisition; previously it was thickly corroded on one face, where the surface is now pitted. The same face has a number of fine cracks, which are probably the result of the process of manufacture. Except for small surface imperfections and a gash on one side, the other face is in excellent condition. Marks of the original hammering are plainly visible on the cutting edge, which is quite sharp and shows distinct signs of wear. The better-preserved face of the axe bears a motif or inscription in hieroglyphs, executed in a punched pointille technique, consisting of three separate elements. Length 153 mm, width 108 mm, thickness 11 mm, weight 1243 grams.Catalog: Abydos, First Dynasty, EA30065 Photo: Don Hitchcock 2015Source: Original, British Museum Text: Card at the British Museum, http://www.britishmuseum.org/, © Trustees of the British Museum, CC BY-NCSA 4.0

A tag from the pre-dynastic period (after O’Connor, D. 2009. Abydos: Egypt’s First Pharaohs and the Cult of Osiris. London: Thames & Hudson. p.145). Archeologist G. Dreyer reads these two hieroglyphs, the elephant 3b and the triple mountain peaks dw, thus spelling the name of Abydos. O'Connor suggests that this may represents the name of a town, which may not be Abydos. Neither seems to address the third element, a schematic tree. (The circle upper left is a hole).

Abstract (quote) Günter Dreyer's Umm El-Quaab I — Das prädynastische Königsgrab U-j und seine frühen Schriftzeugnisse presents comprehensively the results of archaeological diggings in the tomb U-j. It also outlines Dreyer's claim to have discovered the origin of writing. The primary aspect of this review essay is to draw the attention of accounting historians to Dreyer's book and to the claim therein to have discovered the earliest known writing. Since this discovery is closely connected to an accounting function (though in a somewhat different way from that of the Sumerian proto-cuneiform writing), a review of Dreyer's book is well justified. Dreyer's claim is based on a series of small inventory tags (identifying in proto-hieroglyphics the provenance of various commodities) found in the tomb of King Scorpion I (c. 3400 B. C. to 3200 B. C.). 1 Another aspect of this review is a discussion of the controversy surrounding Dreyer's claim and the counterhypothesis of accounting archaeology, which sees in the tokenenvelop accounting of Mesopotamia the origin of writing.

Abstract [quote]Ancient Egyptian civilization is one of the oldest cultures in human history.
Ancient Egyptians are well-known for pioneering the fields of art, medicine, and the
documentation of discoveries as mythological tales. The Egyptians mastered the integration
of anatomy and mythology into artistic symbols and figures. The mythology of Isis, Osiris,
and Horus is arguably one of the most recognized mythologies in ancient Egypt. The Eye
of Horus was used as a sign of prosperity and protection, derived from the myth of Isis and
Osiris. This symbol has an astonishing connection between neuroanatomical structure and
function. Artistically, the Eye is comprised of six different parts. From the mythological
standpoint, each part of the Eye is considered to be an individual symbol. Additionally,
parts of the Eye represent terms in the series 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32; when this image
is superimposed upon a sagittal image of the human brain, it appears that each part
corresponds to the anatomic location of a particular human sensorium. In this manuscript,
we highlight the possible scientific speculation of the ingenuity of ancient Egyptians’
remarkable insight into human anatomy and physiology. [unquote]
