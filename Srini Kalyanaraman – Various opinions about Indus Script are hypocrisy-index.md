# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Various opinions about Indus Script are hypocrisy.pdf

Various opinions about Indus Script are hypocrisy. They are falsified by decipherment of hieroglyphs, N'yāyavijñāna darśanē
नाना मतें पाखंड । कममठता अतत बंड तयाचें ठे चणें त ंड । न्याय -तिज्ञान दमर्ने ।।
Nānā matēṁ pākhaṇḍa. Karmaṭhatā ati baṇḍa tayācēṁ ṭhēcaṇēṁ tōṇḍa. N'yāya-vijñāna darśanē.
Translation: Various opinions are hypocrisy, false doctrines, heresy. With hard (अतत ati,
'extreme') work, jurisprudence, philosophy perception, his face (त ंड tōṇḍa) is
crushed (ठे चणें ṭhēcaṇēm,'bruised'), crippled (baṇḍa).
Some examples of opinions about Indus Script; it is shocking that such पाखंड opinions are expressed without presenting even a single decipherment of an Indus Script Inscription:
1. The underlying language is Tamil. 2. The script is syllabic, alphabetic with diacriticals. 3. It is not a writing system; Harappans were illiterates (those, who do not know how to write language words). 4. The signs are heraldic signifiers. 5. The animals on field symbols are totem symbols of tribes. 6. The pictorial narratives on inscriptions are religious stories. 7. The text messages are liquid measures and the short linear strokes are number counters. 8. The 'unicorn' is a rhinoceros or an antelope. 9. The 'rim-of-jar' sign is a nominative marker. 10. Brahmi script is derived from Indus Script. 11. The writing system died with the collapse of the Sarasvati-Sindhu or Indus Civilization. 12. Links with Rgveda are absurd because Rgveda was created only after 1500 BCE by Aryan Invasion/Migration/Trickling-in/Tourists. 13. The writing system was learnt from Cuneiform of Mesopotamia and Hieroglyphs of Egypt.
These examples of opinions have been crushed, crippled with the announcement of Indus Script Decipherment. https://www.hashcut.com/v/x28zsKv (3 min. excerpt of Budget 2020 by Hon'ble Finance Minister of India)

In summary, Indus Script with over 8000 inscriptions in the Corpora has been deciphered. The underlying language is Meluhha (Bharatiya sprachbund, 'speech union') and the system is logragraphic, i.e. each symbol (whether a sign or part of a field symbol picture) is a hieroglyph. Each hieroglyph is read rebus in Meluhha spoken forms of words. The words signify 1. images such as 'forward-thrusting, spiny-horned' 'young bull', 'rim-of-jar': and words which sound similar to the hieroglyph (hypertext) words which relate to lapidary-metalwork creating wealth of a nation, through guilds of artisans, smiths, lapidaries, turners, seafaring merchants. The inscriptions are wealth-accounting ledgers, catalogues of lapidary-metal work products documenting trade and work-in-process transactions by seafaring Meluhha merchants and artisans.
Thus, the people of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization were literate and documented the wealth of the nation in epigraphs. The earliest inscription is dated to ca. 3300 BCE recorded, inscribed on a potsherd discovered by HARP Team.

This signifies: kolom 'three' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' PLUS tagaraka 'tabernae montana fragrant flower' rebus: tagara 'tin ore'.
Three pure tin ingots found in a shipwreck in Haifa (ca. 1500 BCE?) had Indus Script inscriptions which read: ranku 'liquid measure, antelope' rebus: ranku 'tin cassiterite ore' PLUS dhATu 'cross' rebus: dhatu 'mineral' PLUS muh 'face' rebus: muh 'ingot'; thus,
together, ranku dhatu muh 'tin mineral ore ingot'.

The Meluhha merchants traded in copper and tin as evidenced in Shu-ilishu cylinder seal, ca. 2500 BCE. The inscription reads: mlekh, 'goat' rebus: milakkhu 'copper' PLUS ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin ore'; thus copper, tin ore merchants since the goat and liquid measure were carried by the Meluhha merchants signifying traded commodities. The recipient of the message is Shu-ilishu who is a Meluhha interpreter (into Sumerian/Akkadian).
Isotope analysis Ancient Near East bronze artiffacts has proved that the copper used in the bronze products came from Gujarat/Rajasthan, khetri mines of Bharat. Similar isotope analysis will establish that tin ore came from the largest tin belt of the globe on the Himalayan River basins of Mekong, Irrawaddy, Salween; the Himalayan rivers had ground down granite rocks and acccumulated cassiterite tin ore deposits making the river basins the largest tin belt of the globe. Meluhha seafaring merchants were intermediaries who handled the cargo (stamped, inscribed the pure tin ingots with Indus Script inscriptions declaring the nature of the products signified by the ingots) along an Ancient Maritime Tin Route (Indian Ocean PLUS navigable rivers of Mekong, Irrawaddy, Salween, Brahmaputra, Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Persian Gulf, Tigris-Euphrates, Mediterranean) stretching from Hanoi (Vietnam) to Haifa (Israel). Note the Himalayan ranges which stretch from Hanoi (Vietnam) to Teheran (Iran) and the major navigable Himalayan rivers.

The decipherment of over 8000 Indus Script inscriptions has led to positing an Ancient Maritime Tin Route from Hanoi to Haifa; this Ancint Maritime Tin Route pre-dated the Silk Road by two millennia. The decipherment has also demonstrated that the Indus Script Inscriptions are wealth-accounting ledgers documentations of how the wealth of a nation was created; thus, the epigraphs constitute primary sources for narrating the Economic History of Ancient Eurasia during the Tin-Bronze Revolution, from 4th millennium BCE.
Examples of decipherment of hieroglyph/hypertext 'Rim-of-jar' and field symbol hieroglyphs of 'spiny-horned young bull are provided in Section 1 and Section 2 below:

The semantics explain why dotted circles are embroidered on the shawl of the Mohenjo-daro priest; this procedure of embroidering is at the investiture ceremony of a priest after successful performance of a yajna, according to र्तपथब्राह्मण Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa. The dotted circle is also the shape of the gold-bead of the fillet worn on the priest's forehead and right-shoulder.
