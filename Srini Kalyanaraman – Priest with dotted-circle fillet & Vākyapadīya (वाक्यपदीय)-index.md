13.6.2.17. ...The Traidhâtavî is the final offering (Udavasânîyâ): the
mystic import is the same (as before 1). (Note: The process is as set
forth in V, 5, 5, 6 seqq. As noted in V.5.5.7, the Traidhâtavî ends
with presentation of gold coins. Such gold coins are either tied as
gold-bead-fillets on the forehead and right shoulder of the priest or
stitched on as embroidered adornments on the robe of the priest.

5.5.5.16. Three gold pieces of a hundred mânas 2 each are the sacrificial fee for
this (offering). He presents them to the Brahman; for the Brahman neither
performs (like the Adhvaryu), nor chants (like the Udgâtri), nor recites (like the
Hotri), and yet he is an object of respect. And with gold they do nothing 3, and yet
it is an object of respect: therefore he presents to the Brahman three gold pieces of
a hundred mânas each. Note: According to Sâyana, these 'satamânas' are similar to
the round plate worn by the king during the Consecration-ceremony; see p. 104,
note 2. These plates (as the 'rukmas' generally, VI, 7, 1, 2 seq.) were apparently
used for ornament only, not as coins

Indus Script HTTP शतपथ-ब्राह्मण evidence: ैत्रधातवी इष्टि Traidhātavī (iṣṭi) https://tinyurl.com/xrv64fy7
--ैत्रधातवी इष्टि provides for attainment of three minerals, copper, silver, gold
through yajna. Trefoil on priest’s garment is an investiture ceremony after this
yajna.

‘The objective of the yajna is achieved’; “एष्टिययेज्ञष्टिः इदािीष्टंियमाणैः स्तोत्राष्टदरूपैः
पूजिैः (RV 1.166.14) ‘The investiture ceremony involves prayers prescribed’ for
having attained the desired objects.

A button or sequin made of thin gold foil with a small interior loop for attachment to
clothing. This piece was found crumpled into a small wad, possibly in preparation for
remelting to make a new ornament. (H2000-4445/2212-01, Mound E, Trench 54)

त्रष्ट tri -धातुः signifies ‘the aggregate of the 3 mineral’. ष्टत्रधातुः , धातुत्रये , गणेशः । इष्टत ष्टत्रकाण्ड -शेषः ॥ --शब्दकल्पद्र ुमः
इष्टिः iṣṭiḥ ‘any desired object; yajna’ शबि seems to interpret the word especially in the sense of 'a दशयपूणयमास Rājasūya Caturmāsya yajna’ इष्टििाजसूयचातुमायेस्यषु .
This yajna is performed by सम्राज् samrāj a paramount sovereign; येिेिं िाजसूयेि मण्डलेस्य - श्विश्च यः । शास्तस्म यश्चाज्ञया िाज्ञः स सम्राट् Ak.;

दशकोष्टटष्टमतो यावद् ष्टविाट् तु तदिन्तिम् Śukra.1.185. (Apte) िाज—सूय is
performed at the coronation of a king, e.g. inauguration of युष्टध -ष्टिि described in
MBh.ii (AV); relating &c to the िाज- सूय ceremony (e.g. °यो मन्त्रः ,
a मन्त्र recited at the िाज's ceremony) (पाष्टणष्टि 4-3 , 66)
Traidhātavi needles are needles of copper, silver and gold used to decorate the
robe with single dotted circle, double dotted circles and trefoils (three dotted
circles fused into a flower-like adornment).

Brain chooses yajna contex for meaning of pota, as ‘priest’
Priests are celebrated in an investiture ceremony, anointed with gold,
silver, copper fillets after the successful performance of a yajna.
A narrative of yajna on a Bactria silver
vase, ca. 2nd m. BCE
Fired steatite beads appear to have been extremely
important to the Indus people because they were
incorporated into exquisite ornaments, such as this
"eye bead" made of gold with steatite inlay found
in 1995 at Harappa [Harappa Phase].

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT [quote] Sentence comprehension is known to
engage a distributed cortical network, spanning temporal, parietal, and
inferior/superior temporal cortex (Lau et al., 2008; Binder et al., 2009). However,
how sentence-level meaning is constructed from words and represented throughout
this “semantic network” remains weakly understood....A modern-day scientific
challenge is to understand how the human brain transforms word sequences into
representations of sentence meaning. A recent approach, emerging from advances in
functional neuroimaging, big data, and machine learning, is to computationally model
meaning, and use models to predict brain activity. Such models have helped map a
cortical semantic information-processing network. However, how unified sentence
level information, as opposed to word-level units, is represented throughout this
network remains unclear. This is because models have typically represented
sentences as unordered “bags-of-words.” Using a deep artificial neural network that
recurrently and nonlinearly combines word representations into unified propositional
sentence representations, we provide evidence that sentence-level information is
encoded throughout a cortical network, rather than in a single region.[unquote]

Figure 1 [quote]Overview of our primary analysis. Top left, fMRI sentence reading experimental protocol. Top right, A schematic illustrating how InferSent forms sentence-level representations from context-independent word-level semantic representations (GloVe). Bottom left, Baseline models, which formed sentences by combining GloVe vectors according to grammatical rules, concatenation, or averaging. Bottom right, The ridge regression approach used to map the sentence models to predict fMRI activation. In the diagram, this is illustrated for only the BoW(GloVe) vector; however, mappings were estimated in the same way for all models. The procedure used to evaluate model-based predictions is illustrated in Figure 4. [unquote]

Figure 4. [quote]Evaluation of predicted fMRI sentences. Predictions were evaluated using
two metrics. Left, The rank metric provided a measure of how accurately the predicted fMRI
representation reflected the original sentence recording, comparative to recordings of all of
the other 239 mismatched sentences. Right, The semipartial rank metric controlled for the
predictions made by other models in evaluation. Specifically, before evaluating the prediction
made by one model (InferSent above), the predictions made by other model(s) are regressed
out from InferSent's prediction (in the above illustration BoW(GloVe) is regressed out). The
residual is then compared with the original fMRI activation, and ranked relative to the other
sentences. Both rank and semipartial rank metrics were normalized to the range 0-1. For
instance, if the score was 229, the normalized score was 0.95, computed as (229
1)/239.[unquote]
