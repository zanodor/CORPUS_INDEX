This is a bronze sculpture attributed to Bastar artisans. I found this statue shown in a blog post. This description claims the bronze to be from Bastar (Orissa). But, a blurb on a slide showing the same statue on a school ppt links it to Indus civilization reads: "Small sculptures in stone, terra cotta, and bronze appear to represent priestly or governmental officials, dancing girls, and perhaps mother goddesses." http://www.leon.k12.fl.us/ Location of Bastar (southern Chattisgarh, close to Orissa border)
