THE BEGINNINGS
B
y the second millennium before Christ the formula used by Mesopotamian kings to show that their power extended over the whole Land of the Two Rivers was ‘King of Sumer and Akkad’ The great alluvial plain from the site of the modern city of Baghdad, where the Tigris and the Euphrates approach most closely to each other, down to a point a little below Kuma, where was then the head of the Gulf, was divided into two parts, the boundary between these was ill-defined, shifting this way and that with the vicissitudes of conquest and with the rise and fall of rival elements in the population, but in the main the two countries
stood m sharp opposition to one another, distinguished by the race and language of those who
lived m them Akkad, in the north, was predominantly Semitic, Sumer, in the south, was more mixed, but the Semitic element here was swamped by the Sumerians who had imposed on it their language and their civilization and had the land called after their own name Lower Mesopotamia, which includes both Sumer and Akkad, is a delta redeemed from the Persian Gulf whose waters once reached nearly as

far north as Hit, and it is a delta of very recent formation The upper Euphrates valley and the
high plateau of the Syrian desert had been in
habited by man long before the gulf waters had
receded there the monuments of the palaeolithic age abound, and the later stone age has left its
traces in the valleys of the Euphrates, the Khabur and the Sajur, but in Mesopotamia itself nothing
of the kind is found in the earliest human settlements flint instruments indeed are common, but
they are associated with metal or betray the influence of metal-working, and we can only conclude that It was comparatively late in human history, when man had already advanced into the calcho
hthic age, that the lower valley became fit for his occupation Just by the modern town of Muhammerah in Persia, where in old days stretched the waters of
the greater gulf, the river Karun empties into the
Shatt al-Arab Almost opposite to it is the Wadi alBatin, now dry but once a great nver running up from the heart of Arabia The Karun brings down from the Persian hills as much silt as do the waters of the Tigns and the Euphrates combined, and the
old al-Batin stream, though more sluggish, must have been almost as rich in silt, in the course of time the mud discharged by them into the gulf massed below their mouths in banks which gradu

ally advancing across the gulfjoined up and made a bar from shore to shore The bar neutralized the scouring action of the gulf tide and enabled the Tigns and the Euphrates to deposit at their mouths the silt which had hitherto been swept out to sea, and at the same time the silt of the southern rivers began to fill in what had now become a great lagoon, while the waters of all of them joined in turning it gradually from salt to brackish and from brackish to fresh The mud of the two northern streams that did not go to swell the delta now forming at their mouths was dropped, now that the current was checked by the bar, over the whole of the old gulf area and helped to raise the level of Its bed; thus, while dry land was formed first and most quickly in the north and in the south, the lagoon between grew more and more shallow, islands appeared, and at last where all had been a waste of water there stretched a vast delta of clay and sand and mud, diversified by marshes and reed-beds, through which wound rivers so flush with their banks that they were for ever changing
their courses it was a delta periodically flooded, and in the summer scorched by a pitiless sun, but
Its soil, light and stoneless, was as rich as could be found anywhere on earth, and scarcely needed man’s labour to produce man’s food. The description in Genesis of the creation of the earth as man’s



4 The Sumerians
home agrees admirably with the process of the formation of the Mesopotamian delta ‘Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear and it was so And the earth brought forth grass, and
herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree
yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind and God saw that it was good/ The manner in which the land formed is im
portant as serving to explmn the differences in the population that occupied it A country so nch
potentially invited settlers, and these were forthcoming, but they must have come in gradually as the process of transformation took place, and they did not come from the same regions, but from all the shores of the ancient gulf The northern part of the Syrian desert and the upper Euphrates valley were inhabited by a people of Semitic speech known, when they first appear in
history, as the Martu or, later, as the Amurru. It
was natural that as the delta formed in the north at the mouth of the Euphrates the new land should be colonized by these neighbouring folk following
the retreating waters and cultivating the freshlydried alluvium they occupied Sippar and Opis, on either side of the neck of land where the two
rivers come closest together, and thereby secured
possession of the northern triangle which was to



The Beginnings 5
be the land of Akkad To the north and east of
them, m the Zagros hills and across the plain to
the Tigris, there lived a people of very different
stock, fair-haired and speaking a ‘Caucasian’ tongue, a hill-people akin to the Guti who were to play no small part in Sumerian history, they seem
to have moved down into the Tigris valley, but their advance south was blocked by the Martu occupation of the land neck, so that they failed to
gam a footing in the new delta and remained in what was afterwards Assyna, the neighbour land to Akkad Scattered over the central Arabian plateau were the ancestors of the modem Beduin and these nomads also took advantage of the rich opportumties offered by the drying up of the lower delta
to change their mode of life, individual famihes or
clans drifting down from the desert uplands into the marshes wherever an island site made agriculture possible Thus into Sumer there came a Semitic element which was quite distinct from the Semitic population of Akkad, except for a similarity of language (and even here the dialects must have been very different) they had little in common
with them and certainly had not attained anything
like the same degree of civilization. The colonists of Akkad, coming from a comparatively civilized home-land with which they needed not to lose



6 The Sumerians
touch, were better organized and capable of
common action, so that city life would have been possible from the beginning the southern Semites were strangers to town life, owing to the nature of the marshy country their occupation of it would tend to be more sporadic, and both character and
circumstances would prevent such social unity as
would enable them to hold their own against
neighbours better equipped. The last of the incomers were the Sumerians
These were a dark-haired people—''black-heads’,
the texts call them—speaking an agglutinative language somewhat resembling ancient Turkish (Turanian) in its formation though not in its etymology, judging by their physical type they were of the Indo-European stock, in appearance not unlike the modern Arab,^ and were certainly
^ ‘The Mesopotamian peoples, both past and present, represent a transition between Iranian and Semitic types, but they have retained more of the Iranian than of the Semite As to the racial nature of the al-‘Ubaid people there cannot be any doubt, if they were living to-day we should call them Arabs There is no trace of any round-headed element of the Hittite type nor of a Mongolian type The southern Mesopotamians at the beginning of the fourth milleimium b c had big, long and narrow heads, their affinities were with the peoples of the Caucasian or European type, and we may regard south-western Asia as their cradleland until evidence leading to a different con



The Beginnings 7
well developed intellectually What their original
home was we do not know The fact that Sumenan gods are constantly represented as standing upon mountains would imply that the people came from
a hill country, that their earhest building style is
based on a tradition of timber construction is an argument to the same conclusion, for such could only originate in the heavily-timbered uplands;
the description given in Genesis, ^and the people journeyed from the east and came into the plain of Shinar and dwelt there’, refers to the Sumerians and must incorporate some Sumerian legend as to their own movements, but the obvious conclusion that they descended from the Elamite mountains which border the delta valley on the east does not
meet the case, for though there are common elements in the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Elam it does not seem possible to derive the Sumerian from the latter, nor does the physical type show identity of race • Sumenan legends which
elusion comes to light They were akin to the predynastic people of Egypt described by Dr Foquet, but differed from all other predynastic and dynastic Egyptians The Neolithic people of English long barrows were also related to them—^perhaps distantly, the Sumerian type made its
appearance in Europe in Palaeolithic times, for one of the
earliest of Aurignacian skulls—that found at Combe Gapelle in the Dordogne, France, is near akin to the ancient Arab type ’ Sir Arthur Keith in Al- Ubaid, pp 216, 240



8 The Sumerians
explain the beginnings of civilization in Mesopotamia seem to imply an influx of people from the sea, which people can scarcely be other than
the Sumerians themselves, and the fact that the historic Sumerians are at home in the south country
and that Eridu, the city reputed by them to be
the oldest in the land, is the southernmost of all,
supports that implication SirArthur Keith states ^
‘One can still trace the ancient Sumerian face eastwards among the inhabitants of Afghanistan
and Baluchistan, until the valley of the Indus is
reached—some 1,500 miles distant from Mesopotamia ’ Recent excavation in the Indus valley has
brought to light extensive remains of a very early civilization, remarkably developed, which has a good deal in common with that of Sumer, particularly striking are rectangular stamp seals found
in the two countries which are identical in form, in
the subjects and style of their engraving, and m the
inscriptions which they bear, while there are simi
lanties hardly less marked in terra-cotta figures,
in the methods of building construction and in
ground-plans To say that these resemblances
prove identity of race or even political unity would
be to exaggerate the weight of the evidence, to account for them by mere trade connexion would be, in my opimon, to underrate it no less rashly, it

The face, modelled by Katharine Woolley over a female skull of the period, reproduces as exactly as possible the physical type of
the original. The dimensions of the wig were given by the gold ribbons of the head-dress ; the arrangement of the hair is based on (later) terra-cottas. All the details ofthe head-dress, wreaths, &c.
,
are in their original order






The Beginnings 9
IS safest, for the time being, to regard the two
civilizations as offshoots from a common source which presumably lies somewhere between the Indus and the Euphrates valleys, though whether
the centre from which this culture radiates so far
afield is to be sought in the hills of Baluchistan, or where, we have no means of knowing as yet There is another factor which further compli
cates the question The oldest levels yet tapped in southern Mesopotamia produce a very fine painted
pottery which disappears entirely before the begin
ning of the historic period as we know it, i e
before the earliest of the graves at Ur which must date to about 3500 b c The pots are hand-made or, more rarely, turned on the slow-moving wheel,
the tournette, the walls, of greemsh grey, buff or red ware, are sometimes extremely thin, and are ornamented with a decoration built up from simple geometric motives executed in a brown or black semi-lustrous paint Between this pottery and that
found m the lowest levels at Susa, at Musyan in Elam and at Bushire on the Persian Gulf, there are points of resemblance which undoubtedly connote a certain relation and have by some writers been taken to prove a close parentage, actually there
are also points of difference which make such close parentage impossible The Mesopotamian ware IS older in time than the Elamite and belongs to a



lo The Sumerians
considerably earlier stage of development, so that
It cannot be derived from the Elamite, consequently it supplies no evidence for the Sumerians being descended from Elam Further, we cannot even be sure that the Mesopotamian pottery is Sumenan at all Campbell Thompson, who first drew attention to it at Endu, considered it to be pre-Sumenan, and this may very well be true At a place called Jemdet Nasr near Kish painted pottery distinct from that of the southern Sumerian sites, later in date and more nearly resembhng the Musyan wares, has been found associated with very
early clay tablets inscribed with a semi-pictographic
script, but this discovery only proves that at Kish
painted pottery survived into the period of Su
menan culture, it does not establish its authorship As painted wares of very early date also having points of resemblance to and of difference from those of southern Mesopotamia occur further to the north and as far west as Carchemish, where a Sumenan population cannot have existed at that time, the case for the Sumerian ongin of the Mesopotamian pottery is weakened and that for the
Elamite ongin of the Sumenan people disappears.
Who then can have been responsible for this dis
tinctive and almost sole surviving product of the earliest occupation of the lower nver valley? It is highly improbable that the finely made and

12 The Sumerians
beautifully decorated pottery of Eridu, Ur and al-‘Ubaid was the handiwork of Semitic colomsts
from central Arabia, desert nomads are by reason
of their manner of life unready potters, and what we know of later Arabian pottery would not lead
us to suspect so artistic a beginmng Perhaps the
real clue is given by the parallels noted in the far north. At Ur we have found a crude painted clay figunne ofa man, contemporary with the decorated vases, who wears a long thin pomted beard quite unlike anythmg represented on the oldest Sumerian works of art but cunously like certam figures
on mother-of-pearl inlays from Kish, which is an
Akkadian, not a Sumenan centre, the painted pottery may be of Akkadian origin In that case Its occurrence at Endu and Ur may mean that the Martu, who, for all that their speech in histone
times was Semitic, must have been of Asia Mmor stock, pushed down further south than has been
supposed 2ind controlled the country and its scattered population of Arabian colomsts as far as the
shores of the Persian Gulf, that, in other words, an Akkadian Mesopotamia preceded the incoming of the Sumenans and that the division of the land as we know it later resulted from the dnving back of
Its earhest rulers by invaders from the sea Of the three elements then the Sumenans were
probably the last to enter the south country They



The Beginnings 13
came from a distance and were not likely to be
tempted to migrate so far until the land was suffi
ciently formed to offer reasonable facilities for
agriculture and for commerce, whereas the Semitic nomads were on the spot and would naturally have moved down on to the fertile soil as it appeared ‘Mankind when created did not know of bread for eating or garments for wearing The people walked with limbs on the ground, they ate herbs with their mouths like sheep, they drank
ditch-water’, says a Sumenan hymn, and the de
scription, which scarcely fits the Sumerians them
selves as the apostles of civilization, would be apt
enough for the despised dwellers in the swamps whom the new-comers found on their arrival and
enslaved to their service The account given by the Babylonians of how
civilization was introduced (cf p. 189) implies
that there were already people m the land and that their manner oflife must have been very much that described in the hymn
A glimpse of these marsh-dwellers is afforded by the excavation at al-‘Ubaid near Ur of a primitive settlement of the painted pottery age Upon a low
mound rising above the level of the flooded land there was planted a village made up of little huts whose walls were of reed matting stretched between wooden upnghts and waterproofed with



14 The Sumerians
pitch or with a thick mud plaster; their roofs were flat, of mud spread over mats supported by cross beams, or else arched like those of many modern
huts in the district, in which bundles of tall reeds
tied together serve instead of the wooden upnghts and the tops of each facing pair are bent inwards and lashed together so as to form a senes of arches,
then horizontal nbs of reed are tied to these and reed mats laid over the whole The huts had wooden doors whose hinge-poles revolved on sockets of imported stone, and the hearths were
either holes in the beaten mud floor or were^built up with bncks of unbaked mud Cows, sheep, goats and pigs were kept, barley was grown, and the people ground it in rough querns or pounded it in mortars to make a kind of porridge, and fish was a staple article of food Copper was known, but was still a luxury, for most purposes stone was
used, and small knives, saws, the cutters of the
threshing-machines, arrow-heads and so on were chipped out from flint or chert picked up m the high desert or from translucent obsidian, like
bottle-glass, imported from the far-off Caucasus.
Indeed metal was so rare that the sickles for cutting the barley were made of baked clay, and because these so quickly broke or grew blunt and were thrown away we find hundreds of them strewing the ancient sites Bone was used for awls

and netting-needles Besides the painted pots, there
were coarser clay wares, sometimes with incised decoration, and food-bowls of limestone for those
that could afford such The villagers went on the marshes in narrow canoe-shaped boats with high curled prows made of reeds tied together They wore garments of sheepskin or of homespun cloth, and judging from the painted marks on a clay
figurine they may have tattooed their bodies their
ears were pierced to take studs of bone, bitumen or baked clay, and the women wore heavy necklaces of beads roughly chipped from crystal, carnelian
and shell and dressed their hair in a 'bun’ at the back of the head; the men seem to have had long pointed beards They buried their dead in the
earth lying on one side with the knees bent, and as they placed with them offerings of food, personal ornaments, tools, &c , we may suppose that they had some kind of belief in the continuation of life after death
It IS impossible to assign even an approximate
date to the village settlement of al-'Ubaid, only the presence of the painted pottery shows that it must
have flourished very long before the semi-histonc age which is illustrated by the excavations of Kish and Ur and can be brought into relation with the written records of the Sumerians. But it does
throw some light upon the conditions of life in the



1 6 The Sumerians
delta when human occupation was still in its early
phases, conditions which otherwise we can only
deduce from the natural course of events and from
what we find to have evolved m later times
One must picture the opening stage as one m
which isolated settlers ventured into the drying marsh, put up their reed huts on natural islands or
raised them on just such platforms of reeds and
mud as are described m the Babylonian Epic of Creation, according to which Marduk kneaded clay and spread it over a mat made of rushes
which he laid on the face of the waters, and began
to cultivate their little patch of ground, trenching It for drainage or digging channels for its more
regular irrigation On the wider stretches of land,
and especially along the river’s banks where the
soil was richest, villages would grow up, and with
their growth would come in corporate effort leading to the construction of more important canals
and to something like the scientific control of the river With the advent of the Sumerians, who seem to have been pre-eminently town-dwellers, a further development took place
The conditions of the earliest settlement and the
physical character of the country at the time made
inevitable the segregation of each little colony, in
tent upon putting as much land as possible under cultivation and cut off from any neighbours by



The Beginnings 17
barren reaches of marsh. As the gradual drying of the land did away with the marsh barriers, the separate commumties were brought not only into touch but into competition with each other, all were afflicted with land-hunger, the soil naturally fertile was limited and the reclamation of the Noman’s Land would lead to quarrels between neighbours, canals dug to water a wider area might pass
by or across the territory of another village which could tap Its waters for the benefit of their own lands, cattle-lifting was easier and quicker than
cattle-breeding, disputes over land, water, and flocks must have been common and forced men to band themselves together for protection against enemies around them. Experience had taught that buildings made of mud or sun-dried bnck had to
be raised above water-level, on an artificial platform, if needs be, and that an earthen rampart was the best thing to keep out the recurrent floods, common sense remarked that a rampart more sheerly built would keep out an enemy also, and so the village developed into a walled town Such a town became the centre and the place of refuge for the surrounding district where the inhabitants of scattered farms and hamlets were too weak to protect themselves, Sumerian gemus introduced or evolved a system of government, the building in the town of a temple to that god of the pantheon

who was most in favour with the settlers and the recognition of him as the town’s pecuhar patron
gave religious sanction to the principle of local
autonomy, Xhtpatesi or chief pnest of the temple, as
the god’s direct representative on earth, naturally,
in a theocratic state, assumed the position and powers of civil governor from a very early date Mesopotamia became a land of small city-states.
The result, though inevitable, was not really a logical one. Throughout the whole country the Sumerians, as we shall see, were predominant, and
there was to that extent at least a homogeneous population They had imposed everywhere the same material civilization, the Sumerian language,
used exclusively in the south, had its vogue in the north also, and law and custom were uniform,
even the religion was the same, m spite of the
emphasis on individual deities which served to
differentiate the city-states The unification of the
country was obviously the next step forward, and
a very necessary one if the nch agricultural valley
was to be safeguarded against attack from without,
two things hindered it, the incessant quarrels over land and water, and the local patnotism which grew up in the population of the several states
The clash of these two motives, for centralization
and disruption, explain in a measure the subsequent history of Sumer The ordinary citizen.



The Beginnings 19
husbandman or merchant, demanded pnmanly from his government peace and respect for the rights of property, together with such aggrandizement as circumstances might afford Since most troubles had their roots in quarrels over land and were due to the action or the existence of independent neighbouring states, the surest way to stop them was to suppress that independence and establish a single government This gave a ready handle to the ambition of a governor, and just because there was so much in common between the populations of the various cities the vanquished might acquiesce without too much difficulty in the domination of a kindred neighbour, the change of government need not involve oppression and it did secure peace But such domination rested entirely on force, and power was unstable; let the suzerain once be weakened by intrigue at home or by a blow dealt by some foreign enemy and there was no traditional loyalty to prop up his authority, every city had as good a claim to rule as any other, and its governors, if they entertained the ambition to empire, could count on the old sectarian
spirit to back their rebelhon. Civil war was the rule rather than the exception.
The above is an attempt to reconstruct the history of the begmmngs of Sumer from very intangible evidence There is no written record of



20 The Sumerians
this early period and very few archaeological data have as yet come to light, geography and eth
nology afford suggestions rather than facts, and
for the rest we must deduce from the conditions of
a later age the chain of events that led up to them rightly or wrongly imagined, our sketch has brought
us to the time when history begins, and before
going further we must turn aside to see what are
the sources on which that history rests.

THE EARLY HISTORY OF SUMER
T
he main written sources for the history of
the early periods are the lists of kings, certain
legends, references to events in omen-texts, and,
later, royal inscriptions and the year-names of the kings The results of excavations at Kish, Fara, Ur, al-^Ubaid, Tello, Warka, Nippur, and Asshur, to mention the most important sites, have done much to illustrate the written records and to add to the scanty information which they contain. About 2000 B G , after the fall of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Sumerian scribes took it in hand to record the glories of the great days that had passed away They must have had at their disposal a mass of documentary evidence, and from this they compiled on the one hand the pohtical history and on the other the rehgious traditions of the land
Their histones have penshed, or survive only m excerpts embodied in Babylonian chromcles of much later date, but there do remain contemporary copies of the schematic hsts of kings which they drew up as the framework of their narrative and, for the earliest part, a version made by the priest Berossus in the Greek period
The list gives the names of kings arranged in



28 The Sumerians
their dynasties, the number of years of the reign of each, and the total for the dynasty, it starts with ten kings who reigned before the Flood and details mneteen dynasties which bridged the long period between the Flood and the close of the Third Dynasty of Ur. Unfortunately the list, as an historical instrument, is of unequal and uncertain value When they are dealing with times not too far removed from their own and could consult contemporary monuments or trustworthy records the scribes’ statements can be accepted so far as they go, but even here may be misunderstood The dynasties, as wntten down, would appear to be consecutive, so that by simple dead reckoning we imght obtain the date of any king, but actually some of them are in whole or in part contemporary, one starts with the natural supposition that the kings are suzerains of the whole country, but from the fact of their overlapping it is clear that some at least could not substantiate the claim, and it is hard to understand why they are included, especially when no mention is made of kings whom we know to have exercised a rule limited indeed but none the less important For the purposes of chronology therefore the figures given by the scribes have to be checked and modified by such outside information as is available, and this on so generous a scale that the date of

( Restored)






The Early History of Sumer 29
about 4600 B c which the sum oftheir figures would ascribe to the First Dynasty of Ur must be brought down to about 3 1 00 b c The ten antediluvian kings are credited with reigns which added together make the modest
total of 241,200 years according to one list (which gives only eight names) or, according to the other,
456,000 The figures are m multiples of sars or
cycles of 360 years each, behind these grotesque sums there may be some confusion between different systems of notation, but even so another schematizing influence has been at work and it is not difficult to see that numbers have been modified or invented to harmomze with some theory of astronomy. Even in the hst of the first two dynas
ties that ruled after the Flood and before the First Dynasty of Ur, though the scheme on which the figures are based is not the same (reigns are not reckoned by sars)^ an exaggeration hardly less gross deprives them of any dating value of the kings of
Kish one is credited with 1,500 years and three with 1,200 each, and the twenty-three kings between them account for 24,510 years 3 months
3J days, the twelve kings of Erech rule for 2,310
years. Another point on which criticism has been directed is that amongst the names of the kings occur some which reappear later as those of gods



30 The Sumerians
or heroes of mythological legends. The antedi
luvian Dumuzi IS Tammuz or Adonis, the vegeta
tion-god who dies in winter and is revived each
spring, and he figures again in the dynasty of Erech, Gilgamesh of Erech is the hero of the great legend of which the Flood epic forms a part, Lugalbanda ‘the shepherd’ is a god, Mes-ki-ag-gase-ir IS a son of the Sun-god, and Etana ‘the shepherd’ IS a hero who flew to heaven on the back of
an eagle; it is only when we come to the last seven names of the dynasty of Erech that the kings lose
their divinity and the years of their reigns become
consistent with the span of mortal life
Are the kmg-lists then to be dismissed as mere fables^ Until recently none of the names given was substantiated by contemporary documents until the Third Dynasty of Kish, the eighth in order after the Flood now the discovery of monu
ments of the First Dynasty of Ur, the third after
the Flood, confirms its historical character, and certainly encourages one to suspect a substratum
of fact under the fantastic dates and divine names
of the prehistoric period. The names indeed need
cause httle difficulty At a later time Sumerian
kings were deified after death and even in their life
time; there is no reason to suppose that the practice
was an innovation, on the contrary the human sacri
fices which accompany the burials of the earliest



The Early History of Sumer 31
rulers whereas the graves of commoners do not at any period show traces even of a survival of such
honours may well be interpreted as evidence that
the king was distinguished from his subjects by the attribute of divinity, and round the memory of a
deified king legend was sure to gather. That the Babylonians themselves regarded Gilgamesh as a human ruler and a builder of walls still extant in their day is not a proof, but it is a pointer, we need
not try to make history out of the legends, but we ought to assume that beneath much that is arti
ficial or incredible there lurks something of fact
The mere fact that the scribes recorded ante
diluvian kings and mention cities which existed
before the Flood must signify that the Sumerian occupation of the country dated from before that
great disaster. The king-hsts only mention the
Flood, the descnption ofit is preserved in the wellknown Deluge Epic and, of course, in that variant which is the Flood story of Genesis However much tradition may have magnified and coloured the account, it would be absurd to deny the ultimately historical character of a story which bears
on Itself the stamp of truth, the details harmomze
so perfectly with the local conditions of the south
ern delta that only here could the tale have
originated. Floods ansing from various causes are common in Lower Mesopotamia, and it only re



32 The Sumerians
quires just such a combination of these causes acting simultaneously as is actually described in the legend for an inundation to take almost the proportions attributed to the Deluge ofNoah’s day
The total destruction of the human race is of
course not involved, nor is even the total destruc
tion of the inhabitants of the delta,—thus some at
least of the antediluvian cities survive into historic
times,—^but enough damage could be done to make a landmark in history and to define an epoch.
Its effect must have been far-reaching The cities
which, walled and raised on artificial platforms,
resisted the flood, were the seats of the Sumerian
invaders, it was the open \allages of the more barbarous Semitic-speaking folk that felt the full fury
of the waters, and it is probable that the depopulation of the land by the Deluge assisted more than anything else the northward advance of the Sumerians into territory in which the Akkadians had hitherto been supreme Uta-Napishtim, the
Sumenan Noah, who hved at Suruppak m the middle country and received early warning of
the rise of the waters, may have been an isolated
settler in an Akkadian district, and the 'wicked
ness’ alleged as the cause of the flood may reflect the racial ammosity between Sumenan and Sem
ite, the instructions given to his house to 'be fruit
ful, and multiply, and replenish the earth’ were



The Early History of Sumer 33
literally fulfilled by the Sumerian occupation of the empty land. The two dynasties, of Kish and of Erech, that come after the Flood should be more historical in character, but here again httle can be made out until excavation has brought to light, as at any moment it may do, some further records to confirm or supplement the lists and legends which are all we have to-day The most that we can gather from the king-lists is this The Sumerians of 2000 B G believed, probably with reason, that the Flood interrupted but did not dislocate altogether the national life, for a period which they could not estimate but which was probably very long two city-states enjoyed in succession the suzerainty over the whole country; it would follow that the period was one of comparative peace and consequent prosperity The third dynasty after the Flood, the First Dynasty of Ur, was founded by Mes-anni-padda, the cylinder seal of whose wife has been found at Ur Mes-anni-padda was succeeded by his son A-anm-padda, as we know from the foundation-tablet of the temple which he built at al-'Ubaid, though owing probably to a confusion between the two names he does not figure in the kmg-hsts, and four others of his house are recorded as ruhng over Ur and, presumably, over all Sumer with two kings proved by external



34 The Sumerians
evidence to be histoncal the whole dynasty can reasonably be accepted If the wntten records of this penod are scanty
and of doubtful value, the latter end of it is illus
trated by archaeological discovenes which almost
compensate for the silence of history. At Kish there has been unearthed part of a royal palace of the period of the dynasty of Erech, it would be rash to date the building by the most mteresting
single object found in its ruins, a small stone tablet engraved with an inscnption in pictographic characters which must go back to a very early
time, for such a thing is not easily destroyed and
its presence m the debris covenng the nun might be accidental, but there is no doubt that the palace IS older than the First Dynasty ofUr. Thebuildmg,
which covers a large area and contains many
rooms arranged on an elaborate plan, is constructed of sun-dned bricks of the plano-convex type, i e oblong bncks with a rounded top wherein are two impressed finger-marks mtended to give lodgement to the mud mortar, a monu
mental flight of stairs led up to the entrance, the surface of the walls is reheved by shallow panelhng in the bnckwork and, most surpnsmg of all, there are colonnades with massive bnck columns and bnck columns support the roof of the mam hall Fragments were found of a very remarkable wall

decoration, slabs of slate inlaid with human and
animal figures silhouetted in shell and mother-of
pearl, pastoral scenes and scenes of victory in war
with bound captives being led before the kmg. The technique of the work is admirable, but the
drawing, especially of the human figures, is primitive and the type represented is pecuhar, contrasting strongly with what we have on nearly contemporary monuments from Ur the men with long pointed beards are presumably meant for Akkadians, but the workmanship of the plaques and the
construction of the building as a whole are purely
Sumenan ^ Of the kings of the First Dynasty of Kish four have names which are apparently
Semitic, the rest Sumenan, Sumerian influence therefore had long been prevalent so far north
as this, and though the rulers of the later Kish dynasties seem to have been Semitic Akkadians,
Sumerian civilization dontunated absolutely. This palace of an unnamed king, who presumably was a vassal of the Sumerian overlord of Erech, illustrates the prospenty of the country as a whole and the high level of workmanship attained by the
artists and architects of the south At Ur has been found a cemetery of which the
earlier graves would sgem to date to about 3500 B c and the latest to come down to the beginning of the First Dynasty of Ur, amongst them^are the



36 The Sumerians
tombs of local kings not recorded in the king-lists
The graves of the commoners consist of a square shaft sunk in the soil and measuring on the average
five feet by rather less than four, at the bottom of
this the body, in the simplest type of grave, is laid
wrapped m matting, sometimes the bottom of the
shaft is Itself lined with matting, sometimes there IS a regular coffin made of matting or wattle-work
strengthened with wooden uprights, and occasion
ally there is a coffin of wood, a distinct but contemporary type of burial has an oval coffin of clay, the ornamentation ofwhich is derived from basket
work The dead man is laid on his side, the legs
more or less bent, the hands brought up before the face and generally holding to the lips a drmkmg
bowl of pottery, copper, or stone, his more personal
possessions are placed with him, other offerings
outside the matting roll or coffin in the free half of
the shaft area. In some early graves there were apparent signs of burmng, as if the upper part of the body had been partly cremated, a custom which had died out completely before the historic
period; m many there is placed near or over the grave proper a model boat of bitumen charged with a cargo of clay vessels containing food
The royal graves consist of buildings in stone or
brick constructed at the bottom of a shaft sunk in
the soil, the walls of the building are of rough

limestone, the roofs are in the form of vaults with
apsidal ends, sometimes corbel-built m stone, 1 e with each course projecting beyond the one below It so as to form a ^false arch’, sometimes of brick
built as a true arch with radial joints, the doors in the walls of the tomb chambers were arched with brick or stone Mud mortar was used for the con
struction of walls and roof, but a fine lime plaster was applied to the whole inner face of the chamber
and in some cases to the floor also It is astonishing
to find that at this early period the Sumerians were acquainted with and commonly employed not only the column but the arch, the vault, and (as may be argued from the apsidal ends of the chambers) the dome, architectural forms which were not to find their way into the western world for thousands of years That the general level of civilization accorded with the high development of architecture is shown by the richness of the graves Objects of gold and silver are abundant, not only personal ornaments but vessels, weapons, and even tools being made of
the precious metals, copper is the metal of everyday use. Stone vases are numerous, white calcite (alabaster) being most favoured, but soapstone,
diorite, and limestone also common, while as rarities we find cups or bowls of obsidian and lapis
lazuli, lapis and carnelian are the stones ordinarily

used by the jeweller The inlay technique that was illustrated by the Kish wall-decoration, car
ried out in shell, mother-of-pearl, and lapis lazuli,
occurs freely in the graves at Ur
A description of the contents of the grave of a prince, Mes-kalam-dug, belonging to the latter part of the cemetery period, will show the wealth of this civilization The grave was an ordinary
one, a plain earth shaft, at the bottom of which was a wooden coffin contaimng the body with a space alongside it wherein the offerings were placed The pnnce wore a complete head-dress or helmet
of beaten gold in the form of a wig, the hair rendered by engraved lines and the fillet which bound It by a twisted band also engraved, the helmet came down to the nape of the neck and covered the cheeks, the ears being represented in the round
and the side-whiskers in rehef , it is just such a head-covering as is represented on Eannatum’s
Stela of the Vultures. With the body were two
plain bowls and a shell-shaped lamp of gold, each inscribed with the name of the prince, a dagger with gold blade and gold-studded hilt hung from his silver belt and two axes of electrum lay by his side, his personal ornaments included a bracelet
of triangular beads of gold and lapis lazuli, hun
dreds of other beads in the same materials, ear
rings and bracelets of gold and silver, a gold bull

amulet and a lapis amulet in the form of a seated calf, two silver lamps shaped as shells, a gold pin
with lapis head Outside the coffin the offerings were far more numerous The finest of them was a gold bowl, fluted and engraved, with small
handles of lapis lazuli, by this lay a silver hbationjug and a patten, there were some fifty cups and bowls of silver and copper and a great number of weapons, a gold-mounted spear, daggers with hilts decorated with silver and gold, copper spears,
axes and adzes, and a set of arrows with triangular
flint heads The royal graves with masonry tomb chambers had been even richer, and these presented a
feature to which there was no parallel in the plain
shaft graves The burial of the kings was accom
panied by human sacnfice on a lavish scale, the bottom of the grave pit being crowded with the bodies of men and women who seemed to have been brought down here and butchered where they stood In one grave the soldiers of the guard,wearing copper helmets and carrying spears, lie at the
foot of the sloped dromos which led down into the grave, against the end of the tomb chamber are nine ladies of the court with elaborate golden head
dresses, in front of the entrance are drawn up two heavy four-wheeled carts with three bullocks har
nessed to each, and the driver’s bones he in the



40 The Sumerians
carts and the grooms are by the heads of the ani
mals, in another grave, that of Queen Shub-ad, the
court ladies are in two parallel rows, at the end of
which IS the harpist with a harp of inlay work decorated with a calf’s head in lapis and gold, and
the player’s arm-bones were found lying across the
wreckage of the instrument, even inside the tomb chamber two bodies were found crouched, one at the head and the other at the foot of the wooden bier on which the queen lay In no known text is
there anything that hints at human sacrifice of this sort, nor had archaeology discovered any trace of
such a custom or any survival of it in a later age,
if, as I have suggested above, it is to be explained
by the deification of the early kings, we can say
that in the histone penod even the greater gods demanded no such nte its disappearance may be
an argument for the high antiquity ofthe Ur graves.
The temple of al-‘Ubaid illustrates the religious
architecture of the First Dynasty of Ur On a little mound some four miles from the city A-anni-padda built a shnne to Nm-Khursag, the Mother Goddess,
which is no less surprising than the tomb furniture
of the preceding period and in its way as rich
A
flight of stone steps led up to the top of the plat
form on which the shnne stood, at the stair-head opened a porch with wooden columns overlaid
with copper or with a mosaic m mother-of-pearl,

black shale, and red limestone set in bitumen, the
entrance was flanked by life-size heads of lions
worked m copper with inlaid eyes and teeth, and above the door was a great copper relief showing the eagle-god Im-dugud grasping two antlered
stags The walls of the building, constructed in plano-convex mud brick, were adorned on the outside with copper statues of bulls modelled in
the round, with a copper frieze of bulls in relief,
and with two friezes of inlay work, figures m white
stone or shell set against a background of black
shale, the subjects of the lower frieze being cattle
and scenes from pastoral hfe, while the upper
consisted of a row of birds, clay flower rosettes
with inlaid petals of red, black, and white further
enriched the facade
The discovery in the ruins of a limestone tablet inscribed in well-developed cuneiform with the dedication of the building by 'A-anm-padda king of Ur, son of Mes-anni-padda king of Ur^ and of a gold bead also inscribed with the king’s name and title fixes the foundation of the temple to
a defimte period m Sumenan history and proves
that thus far back at least the king-lists rest on a basis of sohd fact, the cemetery at Ur, being of
considerably earlier date, should belong to the time when according to the king-lists, Erech held
the suzerainty of Sumer and Ur was a vassal

state But it is interesting to observe that between
the contents of the graves and the wall-decorations of al-‘Ubaid there can be traced no real develop
ment of style, even where, as in the case of hons’ heads worked in the round, we have earher and
later versions of the same theme, the artistic conventions are the same and the technique has not changed, clearly we are in the presence of a
civilization which for a long penod was static.
The tomb objects taken by themselves show that art had reached already a level which would have been impossible without a previous history so long that the growth of certain rigid conventions would be easily explamed On the techmcal side alone, the knowledge of metallurgy proved by the use of
alloys and the skill shown in the casting of these
alloys IS remarkable and was assuredly not acquired in the course of two or three generations The Sumenan had a very thorough understanding of metal, and the socketed axes, for example, which
are normal in the graves, are far m advance of anything produced by Egyptian smiths, who for the haftmg of their weapons did not get beyond the pnmitive system of tang and nvet until late in
history, whether the metal be gold, silver, elec
trum, or copper, the casting is without a flaw and
the design is so admirably suited to its purpose that
spear-blade, dagger, and axe become things of

beauty. The same mastery of material is shown in
the more complex field of sculpture a silver cow’s head and a pair of silver heads oflionesses from the grave of Queen Shub-ad combine a digmty of conception and a delicacy of treatment which could only be attained by a craftsman whose skill of hand did justice to his imagination even more
striking perhaps is the solid-cast electrum ass which decorates the rein-nng of the queen’s chariot-pole, for here there is a frank realism such as in more hackneyed subjects had been ousted by
the traditions of art and at the same time a respect
for matenal, evinced by the resolving of curves into planes, which was only recovered by the Greek masters of the fifth century b c If we can
sometimes detect a garish element in their art, as
for instance in the harps with their ammal’s heads in gold and lapis lazuli or in the head-dress of the queen, overweighted with rings and wreaths and flowers and nbbons of gold and beads of lapis
and carnelian, this is but due to the difference between Oriental and Western taste. The Sumerian* did not let colour and complexity blind him to
the beauty of pure line, as is shown by the plain bowls and goblets of exquisite shape which were amongst the treasures of the graves of Shub-ad and Mes-kalam-dug, and when he does adorn such with fluting and engraving the decoration is per



44 The Sumerians
fectly harmonious and emphasizes the structural
lines of the vessel In the engraved shell plaques,
especially those from the bull figure with gold and
lapis head found in the king^s grave, there is a
power of composition, a sense of balance and a clean sure draughtsmanship which, quite apart from the character of the subjects, make them
remarkable So far as we know, the fourth millen
nium before Christ saw Sumerian art at its zenith By the First Dynasty of Ur if there is any change it IS in the nature of a decadence, and from later
ages we have nothing to parallel the treasures of
the prehistonc tombs To some extent this may be
owing to the accidents of survival—^no royal tomb of the Third Dynasty of Ur has been found, and that great period of history is illustrated to-day by
strangely few rernmns of its art The principles
of architecture understood by the early tomb
builders were not forgotten and the use of the
vault, the arch, and the dome seems to have been
continuous, and stone sculpture certainly did advance beyond the crude efforts of the First Dynasty
artists, but for the rest the evidence that we have
would seem to show a steady decline both m imagination and in craftsmanship The conventions already fixed in the time of A-anni-padda gradually crushed all originality and with lack of
interest the worker lost his skill also, so that when

The Early History of Sumer 45
Babylon inherited the art of Sumer we are brought
up against the stereotyped and lifeless figures, smothered with meaningless ornament, of Ham
murabi and the Kassite kings But in 3500 b c. Sumerian art stood at a level seldom reached in the ancient world, and it must have had behind it centuries of growth and experience To this extent the excavations at Ur support the tradition
latent in the fantastic chronology of the kmg-lists
that between the Flood and the rise of the First Dynasty of Ur the lapse of time was very long That the rule of Mes-anm-padda extended beyond the boundanes of his own city-state over the whole of Sumer is only an inference from the kinglists, which presumably deal pnmarily with the suzerains of the land; he himself makes no such claim But the contents both of the al-^Ubaid temple and of the prehistoric graves show that the
civilization of Ur at that time was no localized and
isolated thing. Rich as were the irrigated plains of Lower Mesopotamia, their wealth is purely
agricultural, there is no metal here and no stone,
and not the least interesting point about the treasures recovered from the site of Ur is that the raw matenal of nearly all of them is imported from abroad. Bitumen was brought down river from Hit, then Subartu land, copper came from Oman, as is shown by analysis of the ores, and probably



46 The Sumerians
also from the Caucasus, silver from Bulgar Maden in northern Cilicia and from the hills of south Elam; gold may have been imported from Elam, from Cappadocia, from the Khabur district and from the Antioch region of Syria Limestone could be got from Jebel Simran, a hundred miles
to the south, or, for the finer qualities, from the upper Euphrates valley, diorite was brought by
sea from Magan, some point on the Persian Gulf,
of the ‘alabaster’ or calcite, as it is more properly
termed, some seems to be of Persian origin, some
IS stalagmitic calcite probably from cave de
posits on the western shore of the Gulf, lapis
lazuli is said to have come from Persia where is a
mountain called by the later Assyrians ‘the moun
tain of lapis’, but It appears that there is no lapis
found there, nor any signs of ancient working, the
stone IS fetched from much farther east, from the Pamirs, and the ‘mountain of lapis’ is but the commercial station at which the eastern caravans discharge and the lapis is sold and taken over by
the western traders, such trade with the far east is
entirely consistent with the existence in the Indus
valley of a civilization akin to the Sumerian and,
as is proved by the seals found in the two countries, contemporary with that of the Ur graves and of Mes-anni-padda Lastly there are found in Egypt, about the time of the First Dynasty there, which



12. GOLD VASES FROM THE ROYAL GRAVES AT UR






The Early History of Sumer 47
IS roughly contemporary with the First Dynasty of Ur, certain products which are unmistakably borrowed from Mesopotamia, stone mace-heads, cyhnder seals, stone vase shapes and the panelled decoration of walls, and such borrowings denote at least a trade connexion with the Euphrates valley
Trade as extensive as this could not have existed
unless the civilization to which it ministered had been sufficiently widespread to afford a good market
and sufficiently strong to secure safety on the roads
Evidence for this is not lacking, for there have been
found at Kish graves of the same type as those at
Ur, the earliest buildings at Asshur, the later capital ofAssyria, are purely Sumerian, and though they are some hundreds of years later in date (they
belong to about 2700 b g ) they prove the north
ward extension of Sumerian culture at an early
period as far afield as the village of Hammam on
the northern frontier of Syria there have been
found in Hittite graves shell cylinder seals of Sumerian workmanship dating from about 3000
B.G , and lastly at Astarabad at the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea there was discovered
a treasure of gold objects which show at least the
influence of Sumenan art. Clearly then, during the period which preceded the First Dynasty of Ur, Sumerian civilization had
consolidated itself and enlarged its area It is true



48 The Sumerians
that even in the south country the population was mixed with a Semitic element probably derived from the western desert but perhaps containing
also remnants of an earlier Akkadian occupation, but such formed only the substratum of a society absolutely dominated by the Sumerians In the north where the Akkadians were in the numencal majority the moral ascendancy of the Sumerians was hardly less pronounced, the Senutes were a more virile and a more warlike stock, but they were savages compared to the southern race and
unable to stand out against its higher civilization.
Such hints as we have of the political situation
may reflect this cultural victory The seat of the
first postdiluvian dynasty is at Kish, in Akkad
(perhaps owing to the greater havoc wrought by the Flood on the older Sumerian centres nearer to
the Gulf), and four of its kings bear Semitic names,
then the focus of power shifts to the south, to the purely Sumerian city of Erech, and the next change is to the south again when Ur assumes the suzerainty Mes-anm-padda must have ruled that
part of Mesopotamia which m later times was distinguished as Sumer and Akkad, and though there are no grounds for claiming for his house any wider dominion, yet both they and their predecessors of Erech must have been powerful enough to induce the neighbounng states to allow

passage to their trade caravans As well as grain and dates, almost the only natural products of the country, finished articles of Sumerian manufacture must have been exported to pay for the raw materials coming in from abroad, and thereby the superiority of Sumenan culture was duly advertised and the way paved for further political penetration, the commercial settlement at Ganes in
Cappadocia ofwhich we hear m the time ofSargon of Akkad had already then been long established and Its origins may well go back to the First Dynasty, nor is there any reason to suppose that it was the only trade colony of the sort founded in foreign parts Without assuming any wars of conquest beyond the boundanes of the delta kingdom, we can picture Sumer as a powerful political unit held together partly by force but in a greater degree, at the present time, by the bond of a civilization which had imposed itself uniformly on the different elements of the population and was exercising a profound influence on the neighbouring peoples In the advance ofcivilization the lead is generally taken by military science and equipment In the case of the Sumerians, set down in the midst of peoples physically more powerful and addicted to
war as a pastime, intellectual and artistic superiority would have made little headway, could not

indeed have held its own against the covetousness It must have provoked, unless that genius had been applied to war not less than to peace They built up an empire because they had a better army and better weapons than their neighbours, and through
out their annals war plays a very large part. A
sketch of their military organization is therefore
desirable at this stage, even though it means that
we must to some extent anticipate history The materials on which such a sketch must be based are for the fourth millennium b c a ^standard’ from a royal grave at Ur, the actual weapons from the same cemetery and from the cemetery at Kish,
and the Kish inlays, for the early part of the third millennium b o the stela of the Vultures set up by Eannatum of Lagash and the stela of Naram-Sin,
both now m the Louvre, for the later period
pictorial records help us httle, but we have various
notes from royal and other inscnptions and certain clauses in the Law Code of Hammurabi The ‘standard’ of Ur is a panel of mosaic in shell
and lapis lazuli with figures arranged in three
rows, it dates from about 3500 b c On one side is a scene of war. In the bottom row are chanots,
each drawn by four asses—the horse was not known in Mesopotamia until 2000 b c or later The chariots are low-hung on four solid wheels each made of two pieces of wood clamped together

and fixed to the axle which revolves with it, the tyres, judging from actual examples found in the graves, seem to have been of leather. The body of
the car was square with a lower step at the back,
lightly built with a wooden frame filled in with
leather (?) panels, for the protection of the driver
the front was carried up higher m two roundtopped shields with between them a V-shaped depression through which passed the reins The reins, sometimes decorated with beads of lapis and
silver, went through the loops of a rein-nng fixed to the chanot-pole and were attached to the silver
headstalls, there was no bit, and a broad collar of metal over wood or leather is the only other element
of the harness that can be distinguished In each
chariot there was a driver and a fighting man, the weapons of the latter are light throwing-spears
carried in a quiver attached to the front of the car, actual examples of these have been found in sets of four, of which two are fitted with pronged butts for use with a throwing-thong and would be dis
charged at a greater range, two have plain butts and are intended for in-fightmg In the middle row of the standard come the infantry On the
left are men advancing together in close order, the artist probably meant to represent a phalanx. They wear conical copper helmets with fixed
cheek-pieces and chin-straps, the latter made of



The Early History of Sumer 53
leather or of silver chain, they wear kilts cut in
points or possibly made up of leather stops sewn to
a belt, and over this long cloaks of thick heavy stuff, probably felt (or the spots on them may mean leopard’s skin), such as would have afforded very
fair protection to the wearer, the cloak is fastened at the neck by a toggle and hangs open down the front The weapon of the phalanx-man is a shorthandled spear In front of the phalanx are seen men engaged in single combat with the enemy;
they are armed indifferently with the axe, scimitar,
or with a short spear and with a dagger, and
instead of the straight heavy cloak they wear over
the kilt a cloak or rather shawl of lighter stuff which passes round the waist and over the left
shoulder, these are presumably the skirmishers or light infantry In the top row the king armed with a broad-bladed spear and an adze is seen standing
in front of his chanot to receive the prisoners. The grave of the Pnnce Mes-kalam-dug produced a
remarkable head-dress m the form of a wig of beaten gold which is undoubtedly a royal helmet, on the standard, however, the king is shown wearing
a plain comcal helmet like that of his soldiers
The cemetery, and the royal graves mparticular, have supplied numerous examples of copper pikeheads square in section and sometimes as much
as two and a half feet long, this is an arm not

represented on the standard On the standard
again there are no archers (as there are none on
the stela of the Vultures, they appear only on the stela of Naram-Sm, an Akkadian monument, whence it has been argued that the bow and arrow was not used by the early Sumerians, a conclusion apparently supported by Dungi’s statement that in the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur he ^en
rolled the sons of Ur as archers’) , but m the graves arrow-heads of many types are found and even fragments of decorated bows, some of the former, such as the flint heads from the grave of Meskalam-dug, were not likely to have been used for
war, but others are certainly military weapons,
and we are therefore obhged to assume the exis
tence of a force of archers in the Sumenan army of the fourth miUenmum b g The pear-shaped stone mace-head, a typically Sumerian weapon which continued to be employed as a symbol of authority down to a quite
late period, had already fallen out of practical use; in the cemetery a single example has been found of
a copper mace, a cylinder closely set with short pointed knobs Another weapon which may be regarded as a survival is a scimitar-blade of thin copper attached to a crooked wooden handle by copper bolts and a gold band, two such were found in the grave of Queen Shubad, and one

exactly similar is represented as carried by the king on a shell inlay from Kish The sharp cutting adze such as is carried by the king on the Ur
standard is common in the graves No shields are
represented on the mosaic, but discovenes made in the tombs seem to imply that there were already in use large rectangular shields of wood ornamented with metal bosses or with reliefs executed in copper In the royal graves adzes, axes and spears of
gold occur, in a few other graves axes of silver, the
latter may well be the insignia of officers. By the time of Eannatum [c. 2800 b c
)
changes have taken place in the army. On the
stela of the Vultures no force of chariots is repre
sented and only the king is mounted in a car, this time apparently a lighter two-wheeled vehicle resembling that on a limestone stela of early but uncertain date found in the graveyard of Ur; in
another register of the stela he is shown fighting on
foot at the head of his men It looks very much as
if the chariot were merely for transport and not for
the actual field of battle, the army is on the march with spears at the slope, not engaged with the
enemy; the king is alone m his chanot and holds the reins himself, which he could hardly do if at the same time he had to make serious use of the very long and heavy spear which he holds above



56 The Sumerians
his head m his left hand as if pointing the way to
hisfollowers. The phalanxtoo has been developed. It now consists of six close ranks of men wearing the old copper helmets but armed with heavy pikes and axes, and the front-rank men carry big
rectangular shields, their dress is a more elaborate form of the ‘kaunakes’ flounced skirt and they have
discarded the protective felt cloak, leaving the
body bare above the waist the king’s dress is the
flounced skirt and a shawl of the same material which passes over the left shoulder and under the right arm, and he wears a wig-helmet with chig
non and ears modelled m rehef like the golden wig of Mes-kalam-dug at Ur No light infantry are
represented in the battle-scene, but the task of burying the dead is earned out by men, perhaps soldiers in ‘undress umform’, perhaps camp
followers, who wear only a short fringed kilt open
in front and carry daggers at their belts. On the stela of Naram-Sm the costumes are
of the Akkadian type, the weapons are the javelin,
the battle-axe, and the bow, as is natural in
mountainous country, the men are all on foot and
there is no phalanx formation, the troops, sym
bohzed by their standard-bearers, advancing in
open order. There was no regular paid army, every citizen
was a potential soldier and all were liable to be

The Early History of Sumer 57
called to arms The king m person led his people
to war and fought in the forefront of the battle
From the outset there must have been, as later we know there was, a permanent nucleus for this citizen army; the king presumably had a bodyguard (Sargon of Agade speaks of 5,400 men who
‘ate daily at his cost’) and there were officials
responsible for calhng out the levies who probably
also took command in the field; the use of the phalanx reqmres a certain amount of imhtary traimng and discipline, and the fact that standards
were carried implies that the army was made up of umts or regiments which may have had a territorial
or a clan basis, in either ofwhich cases the head-men would naturally assume the command in war Well equipped and well orgamzed, the forces of the city-states were able to give a good account of themselves, and the wars fought by them were
serious affairs by no means like the bloodless skir
mishes ofArab tnbal warfare* Eannatum claims to have killed 3,600 of the men of Umma, and as he admits to having buried twenty heaps of his own dead the victory was not cheaply won, Rimush of
Agade claims that m a battle against Ur and
Umma he killed 8,040 of the enemy and captured 5,460, whilst for a fight with Kazallu the figures he
gives are even higher, 12,650 dead and 5,864 prisoners, and though the numbers may be grossly



58 The Sumerians
exaggerated they surely bespeak very considerable
casualties 5 on the other hand, a raid of Elamites
against Lagash about 2750 b c was carried out by
a force of only 600 men, but this was not a serious
invasion, and the fact that only sixty of them escaped death or capture rather confirms the view
that the army of a city-state was large, well
equipped, and able to take the field at short notice
A victory was usually followed by a fairly whole
sale slaughter of prisoners, and those who were
spared were earned off to be slaves of their conquerors or were held to ransom, the capture of a
town meant its looting and destruction, and when Rim-Sin took Ism the whole of its population that escaped with their lives were scattered and the
city left desolate the ruthless character of the
wars between the city-states was one of the reasons for the decay of the Sumerian power and the final disappearance of the Sumerians
It IS easy to believe that the influence of the
Semites, first as nvals in war and later as masters
or as predominant partners in the common state, introduced a more thorough regularization of the somewhat spasmodic nuhtary efforts of the Sumerians The foreign conquests of Sargon of Agade must have required a standing force of
more or less professional soldiers and the organiza
tion of the whole people on a war footing under



The Early History of Sumer 59
the Third Dynasty of Ur, as can be seen from contemporary documents and from the Code of
Hammurabi, which reflects an earlier system, the 'army’ employed for the safeguarding of the throne and for any sudden emergency such as a punitive
expedition is distinct from the levee en masse The
regulars were recrmted from, or ex officio formed part of, the higher rank of the citizens and by way of pay and pension received grants of land which they were compelled to cultivate under penalty of
forfeiture, this land was inalienable and heredi
tary, its succession apparently involving on the son the same mihtary duties as had been performed by the father, of the profits derived from it one
third was assigned to the wife or son of the holder,
who looked after it during his absence on service. Presumably the soldier received his rations while
with the colours—^he 'ate at the kmg’s cost’, should
one be captured m war, his ransom was to be paid
out of his private fortune (other than his real
property) if that sufficed, in the case of a poor man
his local temple became responsible for finding the
money or, faihng the temple, the State, he further
enjoyed personal protection against the civil
authorities, a necessary precaution for a man hable to be so much away from home In return
for all this he was absolutely at the king’s disposal;
he could not escape service when called upon and



6o The Sumenans
according to the letter of the law the procuring of a
substitute was a capital offence, in practice exemption might sometimes be bought by payment of an
ilku tax The levee en masse applied to the middle
class of the citizens, the burgher class, who were
not professional soldiers, they performed camp duties and may have formed the light arm of the service. Slaves were exempt from military duty
In this later period there is no mention of chariotry or mounted troops, reference has already been
made to the statement of Dungi that he 'enrolled the sons of Ur as archers^ the Third Dynasty army
therefore included bowmen, as had the earlier Sumerian forces, perhaps the meaning of the phrase is that from this date the archers were normally drawn from the burgher class of non
professional soldiers, while the professionals were
reserved for service m the heavy-armed phalanx
where better disciphne and more regular drill
would be essential The growth of the mercenary principle had the immediate advantage that it enabled the Sumerian kings to utilize the Semitic man-power at a time when the two populations were becoming more and more mixed, and there can be no doubt that the Sumerian revival under Ur-Nammu relied largely on the employment of Akkadian recruits;
of course it substituted allegiance to the king^s

person for the old loyalty to the city-state, and it
tended to enervate that burgher class which had once been the backbone of the city but was in
these days of empire relegated to a second place
and seldom called upon for active service or, if
called upon, might be able to avoid service by money payments The army of the Third Dynasty was probably much supenor techmcally to that of
the fourth millenmum b.g., but the Sumenan state was by so much the weaker, it was the famihar
story of mihtary specialization and mercenary
service leadmg to national decay.



Ill
THE PERIOD OF CIVIL WARS
T
he first dynasty of Ur is stated to have lasted
for a hundred and seventy-seven years, un
fortunately after that the evidence of the kmg-lists fails us According to them the hegemony of Ur was succeeded by that of Anshan and thereafter come nine other dynasties about which nothing whatsoever is known To the kings of some of these are attnbuted again reigns offabulous length, and the sum total of their recorded years, amount
ing to several thousands, is vastly too great for the interval which we know must have elapsed between the dynasties of Ur and Agade
This does not justify us m dismissing the king
lists altogether as mere fable These kings prob
ably ruled, and their names are correctly given, but into the schematic hsts there have crept two errors, one of figures and one of arrangement The impossible longevity of the rulers is due either to some system of reckoning which we do not understand or to a scheme, astronomical or other, to which they have been made subordinate, the
second error is due to the fact that the different
dynasties are set in order as if they were consecutive, whereas the Sumenan scribes themselves



The Period of Civil Wars 63
were aware that there was between them a certain amount of overlapping and it is probable that many of them were contemporary throughout their whole length Since the lists are supposed to
deal with kings who were overlords of the whole
country, it is difficult to understand why contemporary dynasties should appear in them at all, and why, if some are inserted who can at most have been only rival disputants for the hegemony, such a monarch as Eannatum of Lagash, whose domimon extended over all Sumer at least, should have been omitted Were those histones extant of
which the king-lists are an abstract, it might be
seen that the compilers had a motive for what they did, or again it might become evident that they
had suffered from having at their disposal only very incomplete matenal for history, local records giving a prejudiced and partisan view of events within a narrow sphere as they affected
certain cities and from other cities no records at
all In any case it would be wrong for us to take the king-hsts here at their face value, we muSt be content to deduce from them the vague and scanty data which alone they justify and to supplement these by the information derived from other
sources The penod was undoubtedly one of turmoil and civil war, one city-state after another competing



64 The Sumerians
for the supremacy which it was either too weak
to realize or not strong enough to hold for long From the statement that the dynasty which succeeded that founded by Mes-anni-padda had its^
seat at Awan, a city apparently situated east of the Tigns, It might be argued that the Elamites were now taking a hand in the game and were responsible for the downfall of Ur, and again after the Second Dynasty of Kish it is Khamasi, another city east of the Tigns, that imposes its rule on Sumer,
and we may suspect yet another raid by the hill
people on the distracted valley One thing, how
ever, comes out clearly The North was re
asserting Itself against the South, the Semitic element was entenng into rivalry with the Sumenan Three times the overlordship is attnbuted to Kish, once to Opis and once even to the city of Mari high up on the Euphrates by Hit The rulers of Man did at least wnte in Sumerian, whatever their
racial stock, the first three kings of Opis bear
Sumenan names, but the rest are Semitic, as are
the names of all the kings of the Fourth Dynasty of Kish, and when Lugal-zaggizi of Erech rebels against Kish and in a whirl of conquest subdues the whole land from the Lower to the Upper Sea this would-be founder of a Sumenan empire proclaims his victones in the Semitic tongue But the recru
descence of the northerners, though it resulted m



The Period of Civil Wars 65
the division of the land into two parts, the semiticspeaking Akkad and the Sumenan south, did not at all upset or even greatly modify the land’s civilization. The Akkadians had absorbed all that the Sumerians had to teach them; they were now on a footing of equality with their masters in all those respects wherein they had once been so sensibly infenor, and in the process of learning they had not lost the advantage of a sterner and more virile race, if the Sumerians were worsted, it was largely with their own weapons Although a few names of kings, such as Mesihm
of Kish, survive m independent documents to support the historical character of the king-lists, it IS only late in the period of civil war that much light is thrown on the happenings in Sumer and Akkad by contemporary inscriptions or by the late Babylonian Chronicle, which undoubtedly is based on ancient sources Their history really begins with the short-hved conquests of Lugalzaggisi of Erech and with the nse of Sargon of Agade, what else we know is derived from the results of excavations at Tello A dynasty had been founded at Kish apparently by a woman named Ku-Bau, to whom later tradition assigned a very humble origin, the keeper of
an inn or brothel, she had m some unexplained way risen to power and for a hundred years (so
3517 F



66 The Sumerians
legend averred) ruled the whole country But whatever truth there may be behind the stones of Ku-Bau, and she was a famous character in later legend, the dominion attnbuted to her must have
been of a loose descnption, for it is in this period that we can follow, from the contemporary records unearthed by the French mission at Tello, the
vicissitudes of the practically independent state of Lagash, whose rulers, important though they were, find no place in the canon. Seeing that the dynasty of Akshak also was contemporary with Ku-Bau, the Imuts of her power and the anarchy that prevailed in Mesopotamia are the more manifest The mounds of Tello he on the Shatt al-Hai, the
ancient course of the Tigris canalized probably by Entemena, the city of Lagash which the mounds represent never attained to the hegemony of the whole land, but throughout this penod itwas ruled by a house whose members assumed the title of king
{lugat) instead of that of patesi or governor The
first of these, Ur-Nina {c 2900 b c ), seems to have enjoyed a peaceful reign, for his records deal
with such matters only as the building of temples and the digging of canals and, though this is per
haps ominous, the fortification of his capital, three
bas-reliefs preserve the portraits of the king and his family His grandson Eannatum was on the contrary a man of war Between Lagash and the

city of Umma, lying to the north, there was an ancient quarrel which had before now broken out into open hostihties, supported by Kish, whose suzerainty it acknowledged, Umma again declared war and on his great stela of the Vultures, which IS one of the glories of the Louvre, Eannatum records his victory The patesi of Umma was slain
and terms were imposed on Umma whereby the boundaries between the two states were fixed to the advantage of Lagash and tribute was exacted Not content with repelling his enemies, Eannatum embarked on a war of conquest He claims to have conquered Ur, and a tablet beanng the name of his brother Enannatum and a statue ofhis nephew
Entemena have actually been found m the rums of that city, Erech he claims to have captured, and Kish, while the king of Opis was beaten and driven within the walls of his own city; even Man on the middle Euphrates is said to have fallen to his arms and Elam to have been conquered. If the boasts are even reasonably true, the king of Lagash was de facto lord of Sumer and Akkad, and the fact that he made benefactions to the holy city of Nippur would seem to support his boasts, but the triumph was short-hved and within a generation Umma had seized the canal which was the mam source of contention between the two towns, had destroyed by fire the stela of the Vultures, and had F2



68 The Sumenans
defeated and probably killed Enannatum Ente
mena restored the position Having defeated Umma, he installed there a governor of his own with orders that he should see to the control of the irngahon so that Lagash should not be starved of its due supply of water, but not content with that he proceeded to make assurance doubly sure by
the construction of new canals with which an
enemy could not so easily interfere, and amongst these seems to have been the Shatt al-Hai It is no wonder that the king was deified by a grateful people and that after nearly a thousand years
statues were still set up to his godship A splendid silver vase engraved with the arms of Lagash is the best-known monument bequeathed by him to modern times The next ruler, Enannatum II, was the last of his hne and was succeeded by a man who had been high pnest of Nmgirsu, the patron god of the city
Extant documents make it clear that in this and the next two reigns Lagash enjoyed a time of peace, seeing that even the people of Umma, the old enemy, could reside at Lagash and exercise full
religious and civil hberty, but the peace was prob
ably enforced, for the kings of Kush seem to have
recovered their suzerainty over the south and even to have mterfered in the appointment of the
governors It is typical of the country and the



The Period of Civil Wars 69
period that material prosperity coupled with the
fact that the real seat of government was at a dis
tance and the local authorities dependent and not
too sure of themselves led to wholesale corruption
and oppression of the poor by the rich When at last a strong man, Urukagma, came into power and throwing off allegiance to Kish could proclaim himself king of Lagash, he, like a good many
others m other states who had risen in like fashion,
found It necessary to secure his position and win popular support by issmng a series of enactments intended to put a stop to the abuses which had crushed the lower classes Most of his reforms are
directed against extortion by the priesthood The high pnest might no longer ^come into the garden of a poor mother and take wood therefrom, nor gather tax in fruit therefrom^ burial fees had become extortionate and could be reduced to less than a fifth, the clergy and the high officials were forbidden to share the revenues of the god between themselves and to use the temple lands and cattle
as their own ‘If to the subject of the king a fair
ass be born and his overlord say ‘T will buy if ^ or
‘if the house of a great man adjoins the house of a
subject of the king and the great man say to him
“I will buy if’’, the poor owner had the right to
refuse to sell, or, if he were willing, to say to his
overlord, ‘Pay m silver as much as satisfies my

heart and my house’ It was the king’s boast that
'he gave liberty to his people’ Since he claimed the title of 'King of Lagash and Sumer’, Urukagma must have extended his authority over Nippur and probably also over some of the other southern cities which had formed the kingdom of Entemena, but with the possible exception of Erech there is no evidence for this, nor
do the royal inscriptions speak of any warlike
exploits The king’s energy found an outlet in
temple-building, and in his short reign he must have virtually rebuilt all the shnnes of Lagash; the
pnests who suffered from his zeal for social reforms
could not accuse him of lack of piety. Then, m his
sixth year, the end came; the army of Umma made a sudden and unprovoked attack on Lagash, seized the city, slew the pious king, burnt the shnnes he had so lately built, and earned off the image of his god Ningirsu The disaster is commemorated in a lament wntten by some priest or senbe of the vanquished city and found amidst the rums of its buildings by the French mission which excavated the mounds of Tello
The men of Umma have set fire to the Eki-kala, they have set fire to the Antasurra, They have earned away the silver and the precious stones They have shed blood in the palace of Tirash, they have shed blood in the Abzu-banda,

They have shed blood in the shnne of Enlil and in the shrine of the Sun-god, They have shed blood in the Akush, They have earned away the silver and the precious stones . They have shed blood in Abzu-ega, they have set fire to the temple of Gatum-dug, They have earned away the silver and the precious stones and have destroyed the statue They have removed the gram from Gmarbamru, from the field of Nmgirsu, all of it that was under cultivation* The men of Umma, by the despoiling of Lagash, have committed a sin against the god Nmgirsu* The power that is come unto them from them shall be taken away* Of sin on the part of Urukagma, king of Girsu, there is none But as for Lugal-zaggisi, patesi of Umma, may his goddess Nidaba bear this sm upon her head*
Lugal-zaggisi, the patesi of Umma, followed up
his destruction of Lagash by a career of conquest which made him master of the whole delta. The southern cities seem to have submitted to him with
out any great struggle, for he adopts their patron gods as his own, born of Nidaba the grain-goddess of Umma he was nursed by the mother-goddess Ninkhursag of Adab, chosen by Babbar the sun-god of Larsa and by Sm (=Nannar) the moon-god of Ur he bestowed on their temples, and on those of

dued the lands from the Persian Gulf to the Upper or Mediterranean Sea, and we have no right to doubt the claim, but it is curious that no mention IS made of any war against Kish, which lay across the path of his advance up nver and might have been expected to oppose it, the more so as Lugal
zaggisi had staited life as a vassal of the king ol
Kish and was now in open rebellion against his
suzerain The reason would seem to be that he was able to take advantage of mternal troubles in the capitaL Sargon, a cup-bearer of Ur-Ilbaba
of Kish (or so legend states), revolted and proclaiming himself king set up a rival capital at the
new city of Agade, since Lugal-zaggisi seems to
have entertained friendly relations with Sargon he
may have fostered the revolt and must certainly have welcomed the spht which weakened the Semitic state For the Semitization of the north,
which made of it really a distinct country, and the domination of the upstart Akkadian power over the south had given birth to a spirit of Sumenan
nationalism. Lugal-zaggisi posed as the champion
of Sumer. There is no other explanation for the
fact that he so easily secured the submission of the
southern cities, whose pohtics had hitherto been jealously individual, that he showed such deference
to their gods, and that when at last the duel came
with Agade he was followed by the governors of no



The Period of Civil Wars 73
less than fifty Sumenan states His shifting of the
capital to Erech was itself a bid for nationalist
support, for Umma had no traditions of empire and its elevation would only perpetuate old local
rivalries, but Erech had been the seat of the
oldest southern dynasty, and the title 'Lord of
the province of Erech, king of the pro\ance of Ur’ was a symbol of Sumenan umty Lugal-zaggisi’s campaign to the north-west cannot have been more than a raid achieving no permanent result, for within the space of three or four years the country which he had overrun was owning allegiance not to him but to Sargon The new king of Akkad was a remarkable man Of no
family,—he is said not to have known who was his father, whence it has been surmised that he was
the son of one of the temple prostitutes,—exposed as an infant and rescued by a poor workman who brought him up as a gardener (so, in the legend, he IS made to tell his own story), he became a cup
bearer in the king’s service and by rebellion against his master himself mounted the throne, he found a kingdom fallen on evil days and reduced
almost to the level of a city-state, he made it the
capital of the greatest empire that Mesopotamia had yet known Sargon seems to have reahzed from the first that the danger-point for Akkad lay to the north



74 The Sumerians
Sumer and Akkad had formed one kingdom in the past and might again be umted in spite of the racial division now so much more pronounced than formerly, and he fully intended to absorb the
southern country, but he could bide his time for that If Sumer would but keep qmet its independence did not greatly matter, and the best means to secure its keeping quiet was to strengthen
himself elsewhere, to smash Lugal-zaggisi’s federation might cost dear and would not repay the loss, for Sumer and Akkad would still be at the mercy of the more savage people to the north, the brunt
of whose attacks must fall on Akkad, and—here
was the crux—^in any case they must be dependent on the northerners, for the delta had to import all
its luxuries and most of its necessities through the northern terntones by roads that at any moment might be cut To be self-sufficing the kingdom had to enlarge itself So Sargon gave Lugal-zaggisi a
respite and turned his arms in other directions He first secured his hold on the higher Euphrates as far as Man, then advanced north between the nvers, where Baghdad now stands, and attacked Assyna, and the rums of Asshur seem to show that he sacked that city, from Assyna he marched east and conquered the distncts of Kirkuk and Arbil
and next in order the Guti, the hillmen of the Zagros range From Der, east of Baghdad, he

passed on south to Malgium, the territory between the Tigris and the Persian hills, near Amara, and
perhaps from there carried a raid into Sumer and captured Lagash, another campaign took him north of Diabekr into the highlands of Asia Minor Sargon had now thoroughly consolidated his position and was ready to deal with Lugal-zaggisi, he invaded Sumer, defeated the national army, and earned off the king in bords to Nippur ^ Ur apparently held out, but was captured and its walls razed to the ground , but it must have put up a
stout resistance, for Naram-Sm, Sargon’s son, sym
bolizes the whole campaign by the defeat of the
one city when he tells the praises of his father who ‘destroyed Ur and gave hberty to the people of Kish’ The capture of Umma crushed the last em
bers of resistance and the soldiers of Akkad washed
their weapons in the waters of the Persian Gulf
But It was no part of Sargon’s policy to deal too hardly with the south country when once he had conquered it, and even Ur did not suffer
greatly for its obstinacy There was a custom, last honoured by Nabonidus of Babylon in the sixth century b c , whereby the eldest daughter of the

leignmg king became high pnestess of Nannar the moon-god, the patron deity of Ur A limestone relief found in the temple of Nin-gal there and
dating from soon after 3000 b g shows that the
custom goes back to very early days, and an in
scribed relief in alabaster from the same building
gives a portrait of the Princess En-khedu-anna, Sargon’s daughter, holding the same office; the king
evidently was at pains to conciliate religious feehng in Sumer, and his successors followed his example in the honours which they paid to Sumerian temples The Akkadians had borrowed the whole
of their matenal civilization from their more
advanced neighbours, what is curious is the degree
to which they assimilated the religion of the Su
merians, taking over in toto their pantheon, their cosmology and their legends, and seldom even attempting to engraft anything Semitic on to the borrowed stock But their political predominance, which swelled not only the importance but the numbers of the
Semitic element m the south, inevitably brought in cultural change also. Semitic names begin to
appear more often amongst officials, the old Sumerian dress, though retained for ceremonial
use, begins to give place for everyday wear to the
northern costume consisting of a long 'chiton’ or shirt, above which was a big shawl with fringed

edges, earned over the left shoulder and under the nght arm, while for women there was a long garment with rows of pleated or goffered flounces
reaching from the neck to the ankles, and their
hair too was differently dressed, long tresses
braided with gold being brought across the fore
head above an oval frontlet of thin gold plate, even
in such things as cylinder seals there was a noticeable change, and at Ur the great size and bold
cutting of the seals distinguish at the first glance
the graves of the Sargomd period The famous stela of Naram-Sm, Sargon’s son, shows Akkadian
influence at work in another field It is almost Sumenan, certainly it could not have been produced but for the schoohng of Sumerian sculpture, but there is something in it that is new The pictorial freedom of the composition is in curious
contrast to that orderliness which seems to charactenze the southern art The Sumenan might have drawn the individual figures in the same way, but he would have arranged them in formal registers, and his conventions were too set for experiment in perspective such as we have in this scene of moun
tain warfare, the mnovatmg spirit here is that ofthe Semite, and that it should have found its way into
the graphic arts is the most staking proof of the change that was taking place and was to end with the suppression of the Sumenan by the Semite

The Period of Civil Wars 79
Still it was essentially a Sumenan civilization and
art that was diffused by the conquests afield of the
Akkadian kings, and these were so far-reaching as
to influence profoundly the culture of the Near
East
Having consolidated his power in and round the delta Sargon embarked on a senes of foreign wars. On the east Elam submitted to him, on the west he reached the Mediterranean, overran Syria as far south as the Lebanon, and is by some supposed to have invaded the island of Cyprus The ^King of Battle’, a legend of which versions have been found at Tel el-Amarna in Egypt and at Boghazkeui in Cappadocia as well as in Mesopotamia, gives an account of a yet more adventurous expedition Appealed to by certain Mesopotamian merchants who formed a trading colony in Cappadocia, probably at Ganes, and had been oppressed by the local native king, Sargon crosses the Taurus and carries his arms into the heart of Asia Minor, on his return he was careful to bring back specimens
of foreign trees, vines, figs, and roses, for ac
climatization in his own land There can be no doubt that the principal motive of these foreign wars was commercial, the control
of the trade routes and of the sources of supply The kings themselves make no mystery of this. Mamshtusu,the second ruler ofAgade after Sargon,



8o The Sumerians
ends a triumphal inscription describing his victories
over thirty-two allied pnnces of southern Elam with the statement that he thereby secured the
silver-mines of their land and diorite for the making of statues The nvalry of the city-states which compelled an ambitious king to maintain something like a standing army really furthered
the policy of expansion, for when there were no
longer troubles at home he had at his disposal a force which needed employment and could be employed for foreign wars without dislocating the normal economy of the state And these wars were no longer mere raids, an attempt at least was made to organize the newly-won territories as dependencies under governors either sent from the capital or chosen from some local family whose loyalty seemed sure, and the governor acted as the
vassal and under the direct orders of the king of Agade There is no reason to suppose that this was wholly an innovation, something of the sort may well have been done by earher rulers who aspired to empire, but the wider conquests of the dynasty of Agade made the policy inevitable and the preservation of contemporary documents belonging to the penod proves and illustrates its
practice For the ancient cities of Sumer conciliation was the pohcy of Akkad, we have seen that the daughter of Sargon became high priestess at



The Period of Civil Wars 8i
Ur, dedications in the temples of Ur, Nippur, and other states show that the suzerain was at pains to keep on good terms with the Sumerian gods and
therefore with their local followers, and of course Sumer benefited to the full by the commercial expansion of the empire But neither the favour of the king nor the material prosperity of the country could reconcile the Sumenans to their domination by the Semites whom they had once governed and taught, Sargon’s reign ended in a general revolt of the provinces, and Sumer, under the leadership of Ur, took part in the rebeUion.
Rimush, Sargon’s successor, reasserted the dominion of Akkad and smote Ur, carrying off many captives, but the fact that vases have been found dedicated by him in the temple of Nannar in that city shows that when once the rebelhon was crushed the king returned to a policy of conciliation Both he and the next king, Manishtusu, were mostly occupied with wars against Elam and the north-eastern states, Rimush’s vases at Ur are taken ‘from the spoil of the city of Susa’, and at Susa was found part of a stone statuette of the king dedicated there by a patesi whom he had installed for the government of Elam, and the Mamshtusu records victories over Anshan (the province of Susa) as well as over the thirty-two kings of the southern country. But Naram-Sin on his accession

82 The Sumerians
was also faced with a Sumenan revolt, headed this time by Kish under Ipkhur-Kish, it is remark
able that as well as such a thoroughly Sumerian city as Erech there were involved in the rebellion Sippar and other Akkadian towns wherein one would not suspect Sumenan nationalism NaramSin not only put down this domestic revolt, but
proceeded in the course of his long reign of over
fifty years to extend the domimon of Agade to the farthest hmits it had known in the days of Sargon His famous stela records a victory over Lulubu, in the Zagros mountains east of the Tigns, a people neither Sumenan nor of the Semitic stock of Agade but, as an inscnption at Seripul shows,
practising the Sumenan religion, a proof of the
extent to which Sumerian culture was spread by the arms of Akkad At Pir Hussen near Diabekir a rock carving commemorates his conquest of the region, and inscnptions found at Lagash descnbe
him as ‘the smiter of Armanu and Ibla’, that is, of north Syria and the Lebanon, he conquered Elam and invaded Magan, the distnct whence came fine
stone for statues, situated probably on the west
coast of the Persian Gulf, and like Sargon he invaded Cappadocia ‘the four regions bowed
before him’. In spite of the trouble which he had expenenced in Sumer, the government of the south country was



The Period of Civil Wars 83
entrusted to officials the names of many of whom show them to have been Sumerians and the cities enjoyed a considerable degree of local independence, so much so that Lugal-ushumgal, patesi of Lagash, while acknowledging the suzerainty of Agade, yet ventures to date documents by the years of his own tenure of office, at the same time
he sends to Agade heavy tnbute m gram, sheep
and cattle, gold and silver, salt and fish, and work
men had to be supplied for corvee in the capital the religious pre-eminence of the south was shown by the fact that in accordance with the precedent set by Sargon the granddaughter of Naram-Sin was installed in the Moon-god’s temple at Ur, and
the king was active m the work of rebuilding and repainngSumenan temples at Nippur, for instance, at Adab and Sippar Sumerian tradition also
justified the deification of the ruler, and contemporary inscriptions of Naram-Sin almost invanably give him the title of god In the reign of Shargalisharri, Naram-Sm’s
successor, fresh troubles broke out in the north and east and twice there are references to wars with Gutium wherein no victory is claimed After his time the storm burst in earnest, the Guti invaded theriver-land, and the empire built up by Sargon’s house crumbled ignommiously a feeble line of kings maintained a purely local rule at Agade,
G2



84 The Sumerians
Erech for a time boasted an independence con
fined to narrow limits, but the country as a whole was overrun by the northern barbanans ‘who knew not kingship’, and the Sumerian scribes
wrote in their dynastic hsts after the name of
Shargalisharri the despainng note ‘Who was king, who was not king ^ ’ A period of complete
anarchy seems to have followed the invasion, and
there are no records to fill in the historical gap,
but in time the Guti set up kings of their own
whose control, however exercised, did certainly
extend over the entire delta
It is to the credit of the Sumenan civilization
that It survived unhurt the disaster which put an end to the political organization of the country. Doubtless Akkad, which bore the first brunt of the Guti invasion, suffered most material damage, but Sumer also must have been completely devastated by ‘the pest’ The temple hymns bewail the violation wrought by the Guti in the shrines of Nippur, Adab, Erech, and Kesh,and if the accident of time
has preserved no records dealing with the destruc
tion of other Sumenan cities the silence is none the
less eloquent, dunng the Guti penod of 125 years business documents and works of art are alike
lacking Yet of Sumer too it might be said that
capta ferum victorem cepit^ and before long the Guti
kings were dedicating their offenngs in the temples



The Period of Civil Wars 85
of the Sumenan gods which the first invaders had
despoiled, Sumerians were installed as patesis or
governors in the cities—the Guti, one must suppose, were ill equipped for such complicated
administrative posts—and the foreign trade on which the country so absolutely depended recovered Its old importance and extension. As the
conquerors assimilated, or were assimilated by,
Sumerian civilization, the city-states were allowed to regain no small measure of autonomy, the excavations at Lagash have shown what prospenty might be enjoyed by one of them under a
line of active native rulers towards the close of the
Guti period Ur-Bau, the first of these Lagash patesis whose works survive, was a great biulder of temples and in the shrine which he put up to Ningirsu he
dedicated a dionte statue of himself, now in the Louvre, the fact that he could do this and that his
successors used their own series ofyear-dates proves
that only a loose control was exercised over the
city by the Guti suzerain A later ruler, Gudea, whose long penod of governorship dates to about 2400 B G , is one of the great figures in Sumenan history The very numerous records of him that survive are almost all concerned with commerce and with temple bmlding, one only deals with a war and that merely the repulse of a raid by the



86 The Sumerians
Elamites of Anshan It is clear that the country
was under the rule of the Guti and that mihtary
campaigns were outside the scope of the sub
ordinate city governors, but it is equally clear that there was internal peace and prospenty The trade routes were open and commerce with foreign lands went on as freely as in the great days of Sargon of Akkad, Gudea describes the sources from which were denved the matenals used by
him m the building of his temples, and they cover all the countries neighbounng to Mesopotamia, from Elam to the Mediterranean, from the Persian Gulf to the Taurus mountains, and if the royal
inscriptions testify to an international orgamzation very efficient in its working, the many private business documents of the period prove that internal trade too was unhampered and flounshmg But it IS as a patron of the arts that Gudea chiefly
claims our respect Eighteen statues of him are
still in existence, all dedicated by him in his temples at Lagash, in one of them the ruler is
represented as an architect seated and holding on
his knees a tablet inscribed with the ground-plan of a temple Sculpture in the round has made a noteworthy advance smce the days of Entemena It IS true that the proportions of the body are still
squat and heavy—a fault most obvious m the
larger works and perhaps m some measure due to

the matenal, diorite was imported in the shape of
natural boulders, seldom very large, and the artist, anxious to emphasize the most important feature of his subject, might be tempted to make the head too big for the body whose size was conditioned by the block, but though the forms may be heavy and the attitudes are conventionally stiff, there is in the
treatment of the flesh a quality that fully atones
for this The musculature is faithfully observed, but rendered without any of that harsh exaggera
tion which disfigures later Assyrian art; having
achieved strength by his mam lines, the sculptor indulges in a modelling which by contrast might be thought almost morbidly delicate, probably in
this too he IS being true to nature, and in these
figures, where underlying force seems belied by softness of texture, exposes the tragedy of the
Sumerian It is cunous that he cares not at all for drapery, and represents dress as a sheath which
has no particular beauty of its own and betrays nothmg of the body it envelops it must be remembered that art here was not an end in itself
but subservient to religious ends and limited by
strict and ancient canons, the wonder is that, thus
conditioned, the artist yet attains to such a degree of beauty and truth Ever since de Sarzec’s discovery of the first
twelve statues at Tello they and the fragments of



88 The Sumerians
bas-reliefs which were found with them have been regarded as the critenon of Sumerian art and the
Gudea period as illustrating best the purely Sumer
ian civihzation None the less, in the business
tablets from Tello, Semitic names occur freely and even in the rehgious texts Semitic phrases are
introduced, it is clear that so far south as Lagash the population was becoming more and more mixed, and the racial element which was strong enough to gain a footing of equahty with the old

merian civihzation had imposed itself first on the Akkadians, then on the Guti, and had pursued its own course of development umnfluenced by its proselytes, but the pohtical mdividuahty of the south country was being steadily undermined The process must have been obvious at the time and have wakened the resentment of the Sumerians, who would not without a struggle rehnqmsh their traditional supenonty. Gudea’s records are
curiously silent as to pohtics, so silent that the
chronology ofhis period is a matter of conjecture

there is no mention of any Guti overlord, no reference to ^tpalesis of other towns which might help to synchronize events, but there can be httle doubt that he hved to see the end of the Guti tyranny And this end was a Sumerian renaissance. Utu

khegal, the patesi of Erech, revolted against ^the enemy of the gods’ and proclaimed the independence of Sumer, it is symptomatic that in his proclamation the name Sumer occurs for the first time as that of the united south land Tingan, the Guti king, attempted a compromise, sending as envoys to Erech two men, a Sumerian and a
Semite—and his choice of the latter further shows how important had become the Semitic popula
tion of the south—but the embassy failed In the battle that followed Tirigan was abandoned by his own troops and, made prisoner by the people of the village of Dubrum, was handed over to Utukhegal, and the forces of the Guti were finally expelled from the land. Utu-khegal assumed the title of king, appointed native governors to the various cities, and under a Sumerian dynasty revived or earned on the imperial organization of Sargon

efore dealing with the political revival of Sumer under the Third Dynasty of Ur we may turn aside to examine the social organism which had been growing up in southern Mesopotamia
and was to be stereotyped by the legislation of a
more settled age Sometimes it is possible to trace
that growth or to illustrate earlier phases of it^ but very often customs undoubtedly old come to light
for the first time in documents of relatively late
date, and in so far as these are quoted the following
chapter is an anticipation of events Since, how
ever, It IS the life and thought of a people that give
value to Its history the descnption of them ought
not to be postponed until the history is ended, here
It will serve as an introduction to the last but the
most glorious age of Sumer, the real greatness of which it would otherwise be hard to understand
The period of the wars of the city-states which elapsed between the downfall of the First Dynasty of Ur and the Sumerian revival under Utu-khegal saw the evolution and development of civil law That this should result from the anarchy of the
times may sound paradoxical, but it has already been remarked that when anarchy led to the



Sumerian Society 91
oppression of the many by the few the best pohcy
of an individual pretender to power was to con
ciliate the bulk of his subjects by the reform of
abuses and the re-enforcement of law The famous code of Hammurabi of which the text, discovered at Susa, IS now in the Louvre, was drawn up about 1900 B c by a Semitic ruler after Sumer had ceased to exist, but it throws no httle light on the penod with which we are concerned It is of course not a series of arbitrary enactments invented by the Babyloman king but a redaction of
old partial or local codes and of old customs, and the tradition which it embodies was, hke nearly
everything else in Babylonian civilization, derived directly from the Sumenans Nor was this the first time that an imperial code had been drawn up
Dungi, king of Ur m the Third Dynasty, was the author of a code on which Hammurabi’s was more immediately based, and before his time there
existed others such as that of Urakagma The
kings of Ism had codified the law, and there were collections known as ‘the laws of Nisaba and Ham’ which may date from their time, of these fragments were found at Nippur and at Erech Moreover, every city had its inheritance of law, founded
largely on decisions of the courts and so corresponding more or less to our Common Law, and these were either incorporated by Hammurabi or



92 The Sumerians
not superseded by him, thus in deciding a legal case the judges of his time could give as their
ruling that ‘the law of the citizens of Sippar shall
be the law applied to the parties’. The only arbi
trary feature in Hammurabi’s code is the application to the whole empire of laws whose ongm had been local and their vogue restricted, the extension
of their scope made possible and sometimes in
evitable certain modifications which would better recommend them to a wider public and, in view of the fact that the Sumerians had now been swamped
by the Semites, the modifications are inspired by
and appeal to the Semitic spirit Comparing what exists of the old Sumerian codes with that of Hammurabi, we see that the tendency ofthe Semite
has been to exact severer penalties for certain
offences, especially for offences against the sacred
ness of the family tie, adultery involves death for both gmlty parties, whereas under the Sumerian law it did not necessanly mean even divorce, the harbouring of the runaway slave belonging to the
palace or to a free citizen was a capital offence, whereas in Sumer it was atoned by restitution in
kind or by a fine of twenty-five shekels; a slave
who disputed his master’s rights over him had his ear cut off, according to Hammurabi’s code, by Sumerian law was simply sold, but allowing for such sharpemng of penalties we can derive from



Sumerian Society 93
the Babylonian code a very fair idea of the law which the Sumenans had evolved and under
which their highly-organized civilization flour
ished, The actual working of the laws can to some extent be followed from the numerous pnvate
tablets recording legal decisions, contracts, busi
ness affairs, &c Practically every act of civil life,
of buying and selling, loans, contracts, legacies, adoption, mamage, divorce, was a matter of law and as such was duly recorded in writing and
confirmed by the seals of witnesses A dispute in any such subject required the production in court
of the original documents, and though the written evidence might be supplemented and sometimes had to be replaced by verbal evidence given on
oath, yet for the transaction to be really legal 'the
tablet’ was essential. There were two kinds of
court, civil and ecclesiastical, for every temple was
a place of justice and every pnest was entitled to pronounce judgements, but there were also regular judges appointed by the king, and certain of the higher officials such as the mayor of the city and
the patesi or ishakku^ the governor of the province,
possessed judicial functions; in all cases the ulti
mate appeal was to the king’s person.
The plaintiff made his first apphcation to a functionary called the mashkim who was not properly
a magistrate but rather an arbitrator and whose



94 The Sumerians
duty it was to attempt to settle the case by arrangement between the parties without regular process
of law If his efforts failed, or if the case was too
important to he within his province, recourse was
had to the regular court presided over by pro
fessional judges, called two to four in number,
the mashkim being associated with them on the bench The two principals and the witnesses gave
their testimony on oath ^by the name of the king’ and precedents were quoted to support the judgement A judge was forbidden to reverse his sentence when once that had been recorded in writing, and the penalty for so doing was a fine and
dismissal from office, but the finding could be upset
on appeal to the higher court Constables attached
to the court under the judges’ orders would see to
the execution of sentence, in the majority of cases
this would take the form of a fine or confiscation of
property, but in cases of assault and injury to
the person the rule of 'an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth’ was prescribed and was presum
ably carried out by officials of the government, the capital penalty was not uncommon for senous offences and mutilation was ordered for certain cnmes, not only as a retahatory measure In every action the sentence had to be recorded in writing; the court scnbe drew up a tabjet in concise
form, entenng the special features of the case, the



Sumerian Society 95
names of pnncipals and witnesses, and the result
of the trial, and this tablet was authenticated by
the seals of the interested parties, was filed in the
archives of the court or temple, and served as a
precedent for the future sometimes it was en
closed in a clay envelope on which a summary of the case was written and the seals of the witnesses
impressed It is evident that in ancient Sumer
justice was put within the reach of every man, and a litigious pubhc took full advantage ofthe facilities given them, by assigmng heavy penalties for false
evidence and by granting free right of appeal the State did its best to check the abuse of the courts. But men were not all equal before the law The Code of Hammurabi recognized certain social
grades which, if we have the first clear defimtion
of them only so late as 1900 B c , had existed earlier and may well have been a legacy from primitive ages The population of the country was
divided into three classes, the patrician order
{amelu) included all government officials, pnests,
and soldiers of the regular army, the burgher class {mushkinu), merchants and shopkeepers, school
masters, labourers, farmers, and artisans, were
free men but infenor to the first, at the bottom of the scale came the slaves who, whether captured in
war, purchased, or bom in the house, were legally
little more than chattels of their masters Between



1 he bumerians
9^
these classes the law made a very sharp distinc
tion An offence committed against an amelu was
punished with far more severity than if the sufferer
had belonged to the second order in the state, the
accidental killing of a nobleman involved a fine of half a mma and that of a burgher a fine of a third of a mma only, if a blow dealt to the daughter of a nobleman caused a miscarriage, the pumshment
was ten shekels as against five in the case of a
burgher’s daughter, and if it caused death the
aggressor’s daughter would be put to death m the first case whereas to a burgher he would pay only
a half-mina of silver On the other hand, where an
amelu was the aggressor m such affairs of violence he was punished more severely than was his social
inferior, and the principle of 'an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth’ was apphed to him where a
mushkinu escaped with a money fine, further, he
paid for his superior status in other ways and the medical fees chargeable to a nobleman were double those to which the burgher was legally
liable It has been suggested that this class distinc
tion IS ultimately one of race, the aristocracy
representing a conquermg and the middle class a
subjugated people, and it is of course true that the
ranks of the latter were constantly reinforced by the enfranchisement of slaves who were often of dif
ferent stock; but it would be difficult to explain



Sumerian Society 97
why a conquenng race imposed on themselves the disabihties from which the amelu actually suffered, and as a matter of fact the Sumenan aristocracy did not form a close racial corporation in that men with Semitic names are constantly found holding offices which earned with them the rank of nobility. I think it more hkely that the caste system was in its ongin mihtary Slaves were not employed in war, naturally, because once armed they would be a danger to the state The mushkmu were hable to the levee en masse and might be sent on campaign as camp-followers or transport-workers and perhaps as light-armed troops, and they would be called upon to defend their own homes when invasion threatened. But the amelu filled the ranks of the regular army and were the backbone of the State; as such their hves were of more value than those of the non-combatant citizen and they merited the privileges they fought for, but because the efficiency of the army depended on its disciphne, offences committed by them were regarded more seriously and pumshed more severely than those of other men it is noteworthy that the law differentiates between amelu and mushkmu only in such matters as affect the person, where the value of the individual as such comes into question, where property is concerned, as in the case of theft, the two classes are on exactly the same footing.
3517 H



gS The Sumerians
Though the slave was so much the property of
his master that the fine for the killing or maiming of one was payable not to him but to his owner, yet the law did not leave him altogether without
rights He could protest against his own sale and
submit the matter to the courts; he could give
evidence, own property, engage m business in his own name, borrow money, and buy his freedom, liberty whether purchased by himself or granted by his master with the proper formula of enfranchisement was final and beyond dispute On the other hand, he might be branded and flogged, had little or no protection against bad treatment, and was punished severely if he attempted to escape, for a man to give asylum to a run-away slave was
a serious offence and he had to make restitution
of a slave to the defrauded owner or pay a fine of
twenty-five shekels of silver The methods by which slaves were recruited and the possibility, always open, of enfranchisement
resulted in there bemg no real stigma attached to the status, it was a man’s nusfortune that reduced
him to servitude, not his fault Prisoners of war, who might be Sumerians of good family from a neighbouring state and were hable to be ransomed at any moment, would hardly form a despised
class, and even in the case of real foreigners there was not that degree of difference between them



Sumerian Society 99
and their masters which enabled an American slave-owner to regard his negroes as outside the pale of humanity, nor had the Sumenan that racial exclusiveness which made the ancient Greek look upon ‘barbanans’ as natural slaves The view of slavery as an accident and not an axiom accounts
for certain Sumerian customs which at first sight appear inexplicably callous not only was the free
born citizen punished for certain offences by being reduced to slavery, as when an adopted son repudiated his foster-parents, but a man and wife
nught legally sell their own child as a slave, and in payment of debt a man might hand over his wife,
his son, or daughter to his creditor to be his slave for the space of three years. The same view caused the gulf between bondman and free to be bridged in a converse manner, if a freeman took a slave as his concubine and had children by her, she might not be sold, and on his death both she and her children were automatically enfranchised though without a specific act of adoption they were not
his heirs, and if a free woman married a slave (as she could do without disgrace), the children mhented the mother’s freedom and on their father’s death half his property came to them and only half reverted to his owner In a society where the free man may become a slave and the slave may acquire his freedom slaves are not likely to be ill

treated; amongst the Sumenans slavery must have been of a mild type contrastmg well with the practice of many other lands where it has been
instituted. One of the cntena by which a society can fairly be judged is the position which it accords to women In Sumer monogamy was the law of the land, and though in practice this was modified by the toleration of concubinage, yet the status of
the legitimate wife was so well protected that the principle was not senously impugned Mamage was arranged by the elders of the families and the betrothal was signahzed by the
presentation from the bridegroom to his future
father-in-law of a money gift, which he forfeited if he broke off the engagement and could recover twofold if the bnde changed her mind; this was a survival of an older custom of mamage by purchase, retained in order to make the betrothal more bmding Probably there was more freedom of intercourse between young people of both sexes than the practice of ‘arranged mamages’ suggests, a man who seduced a girl was obhged to
ask her of her parents m mamage, and a betrothed girl might before mamage take up her abode in the house of her future father-m-law, and her freedom after marriage appears inconsistent with
any strict cloistering in youth. The weddmg



Sumerian Society lor
ceremony seems to have consisted simply m the
wnting and sealing of the tablet—the ‘marriage
lines’—^wherein the position of the two parties was
clearly defined and the penalty for infidelity and
the conditions for divorce detailed beforehand On marriage the bnde assumed possession of the
betrothal-gifts and further brought to her new home a dowry given by her own relations, this was her inalienable property which on her death she could bequeath to her children, failing which
It reverted to her father’s house, but for the time being it was held jointly with her husband A
special clause in the marnage contract could
secure the wife against the creditors with whom her
husband might be involved previous to the wed
ding, and in no case could he dispose of their joint property without her consent, but for debts contracted during marned hfe both parties were
jointly responsible She could keep and dispose of her own slaves and engage independently in business, as could an unmarried woman, she could give witness in a court of law, and in the event of her husband’s absence she admimstered his estate unless there was a grown-up son to undertake the
task. If her husband died, she inherited the same
share ofhis property as did each ofhis children and could marry again at pleasure, taking with her her original dowry but rehnquishing her share of her



102 The Sumenans
late husband’s estate, over the children she enjoyed
equal rights with their father and could disinhent an undutiful son and even have him branded and expelled from the city On the other hand, she
suffered certain disabilities as against the man
A husband could under certain conditions sell his
wife, and he could hand her over as a slave for
three years in payment of debt, he could (unless
she were protected by a special clause of the marnage contract) divorce her on very shght grounds, whereas for her divorce was a much more difficult matter and was only possible if her own conduct had been above reproach, adultery by the woman, in early days a venial offence, was more and more senously regarded as time went on and by the penod of the Third Dynasty of Ur was punishable with death by drowmng Moreover, her position in the house was rendered precarious by the impenous demand of the peoples of the Near East for children to carry on the name, barrenness, if it
did not dissolve the marnage tie, at least deprived
the wife of her exclusive nghts in wedlock
A barren wife could be divorced, taking back her dowry and receiving a sum of money by way of compensation, otherwise the husband could take a second wife, but in that case he not only continued to be responsible for the maintenance
of the first but had to safeguard her position in the



Sumerian Society 103
home, the new wife was legitimate, but not the
equal of the old, and a written contract defined the degree of her subservience, thus she might be
obhged 'to wash the feet of the first and to carry
her chair to the temple of the god’. In practice, however, the status of the two women must have been somewhat anomalous, and to forestall this the wife might present to her husband one of her own slaves as a concubine, on giving birth to a child the slave-woman automatically became free (which was not the case if the husband took one of his own slaves into his harem) but was by no means
the equal of her old mistress; indeed, should she
rashly aim at beconnng her rival, the mistress could
reduce her again to slavery and sell her or other
wise get rid of her from the house,—^the history of Abraham, Sarah and Hagar is an illustration of this, for in every detail Abraham was not acting
weakly or arbitrarily but was putting into practice the old Sumerian law in which he had been brought up A man who had thus received a second wife from the hands of his first could not brmg another woman into his house, should the introduction of
a secondary wife displease the first, she could withdraw to her father’s house takmg her dowry with her, but though such alleviations were provided, it
IS evident that in marnage the personality of the
wife was subordinate to her function as mother, if



104 Sumerians
childlessness were due not to physical inability but
to the wife’s refusal of conjugal relations, she was thrown into the water and drowned By Sumerian law children were absolutely under
the authority of their parents who might at will
disinherit or disown them, the domestic sentence involving banishment from the city, they could
also be sold into slavery or temporarily sur
rendered as slaves in payment of debt, the parents
could in their hfetime make benefactions outside the family which would lessen or annul their
children’s inheritance But in the normal course of events a man’s property descended to his children, and the division of it among them was fixed by law there was no pnvilege of primogeniture, but after a sum had been set aside to provide bndepurchase money for the sons not yet of age the remamder of the estate was apportioned on the scale of one part to the widow and to each son, this
being in fee simple, the interest in one part to each daughter who had not received a dowry, the prin
cipal ultimately reverting to her brothers, a hfe interest in one part to a daughter who had become a lay sister, and a third of a part for a daughter who had become a temple prostitute there was, however, an old custom recogmzed by the Sumenan ‘Law of Nisaba and Ham’ whereby a son had the nght to claim his share of the inheritance during



Sumerian Society 105
his father’s lifetime (a custom which persisted long
amongst the Jews, as witness the Parable of the Prodigal Son) , the advance would be recorded in legal form and he would have no further claim on his father’s estate The mother’s dowry was divided equally among all her children
Besides the recognition of children whom he
might have by a concubine—and these even when
legitimated remained in a position of inferiority as
against the sons of the true wife—adoption of
unrelated children was very common A deed had
to be drawn up secunng the position of the child vis-d-vts children who had been or might be born to the foster-parent, givmg it absolute equality with them; should he at any time wish to rid himself of the adopted child, he could repudiate him,
but the child had a nght to one-third of the movable property of the house, did the son deny his
foster-father and, having discovered his real parents, attempt to return to them, he was branded and sold as a slave, and if the mother were of the
prostitute class his tongue was cut out. It may
well be that the prevalence of adoption was in
a large measure the result of the practice of temple
prostitution and that it was encouraged and safeguarded by the law as being one way out of the
social difficulty arising from the number of children whose fathers were not to be known and who



io6
otherwise would have been a burden on the temple revenues
Side by side with a domestic life so carefully
regulated by laws which on the whole are liberal
and tend to uphold the rights of the individual so
far as those do not conflict with the superior claims
of the family, there existed a system of religious
prostitution Attached to every temple there was a body of women who formed part of the god’s household, since by the anthropomorphic beliefs of the time he was credited with human needs and
his temple and its servants were but a replica of the
palace and following of an earthly king* the chief
of these women was the bnde of the deity, the rest were his concubines and his domestics, as such
they were members of a religious profession dedi
cated to the divme service and entitled to the
respect of the law. When a man entered his
daughter for this honourable profession the initiating ceremony was celebrated with sacnfice and he brought with her to the temple the dowry which was required by her marriage with God, but the votaress was not vowed to virginity. There were vanous grades of temple women but all were
prostitutes.
The entu^ the legitimate first wife of the god,
belonged to the highest caste in her sisterhood, and of her we know httle She had to be circumspect



Sumerian Society 107
and correct m her life, as befitted a lady of high rank, and it must be remembered that she might be actually a king’s daughter, as was commonly the
high priestess of Nannar at Ur—and the penalty
for an act so unseemly as that she should enter a wine-shop was, under the law of Hammurabi, death by burning. The priestesses of the second caste, the Sal-Me, were more numerous and since they engaged much in trade and have therefore
left behind them records in the shape of contracttablets more can be said about them They hved in the convent of the sisterhood, at least in the
early years of their service; they had children, but
by an unknown father—the child of a SaUMe is called after his mother only she could marry a man but was not allowed to have children by him, for that she must give him one of her slaves
as a concubine theoretically she was the god’s
wife and the human intercourse which the fulfilment of her vows imposed on her was glossed over as a mystical mamage Less mystery attached
to the lower orders, the ztkru and the kadishtu^ who are temple harlots pure and simple (the latter are those proscribed in Deuteronomy xxiu 18), though the former were sufficiently respectable to be taken by men in marriage, while at Erech, the
seat of the hcentious worship of Ishtar, there were
yet other grades lower m rank and against mar

nage with such even the popular proverbs gave warning There is no evidence for the existence at an early penod of that custom described by Herodotus in the fifth century b g whereby every woman had to present herself at the temple and
submit her body to a stranger before she was
ehgible for regular marnage, but it is certain that the temples of Sumer housed a great number of prostitutes and that rehgion managed to throw over the profession a cloak of honour. Perverted
as It was, and the degraded ministrants of Ishtar arc an extreme example of the perversion, the underlying idea must have been that of real devo
tion, of sacnfice, the devotee gave to the service of
god the virgimty which as plenty of clauses m the law prove was no less precious to the Sumerian woman than to others Like the medieval monasteries of Europe the temples of Sumer were tLe centres of education Attached to most if not all of them there were schools where boys and girls were trained to the
profession of the scnbe. The wnting of cuneiform, with its hundreds of signs, many of them with a multiphcity of values, was an art not to be mastered by every one, but because Sumer was
essentially a commercial country, so that correspondence was large, and because by law virtually
every transaction of life had to be recorded m



Sumerian Society 109
writing, the number both of professional scribes and of pnvate citizens who could read and write for themselves must have been great Many ^school
tablets’ survive and illustrate the course of study
practised in the temple classes First there are long
lists of single signs with their phonetic values for
the pupil to memorize, then lists of signs grouped together in alphabetical order, and of ideograms,
the signs which stood for a single word or idea and
might be inserted in the text before a compound group to give its genenc meaning in advance

thus the sign hlu^ gave warning that the following group was the name of a god, ^matu^ that it was the name of a people, and the sign for Vood’ would come before the word for ^box’ or the name of
a tree Then come short sentences, the common
formulae of the texts, honorific titles, and so on, and from these the pupil advanced to the grammar ofthe language and we find tablets giving the paradigms of verbs and the declension of nouns. By this time he was writing on his own account, on one side of a flat round tablet of soft clay the teacher
wrote his Tair copy’ and the learner after studying this turned the tablet over and endeavoured to reproduce on the back of it what had been written After grammar came mathematics, and
we find tables of multiphcation and division, tables
for the extraction of square and cube roots, and



no
exercises in applied geometry—^for instance, how
to calculate the area of a plot of ground ofirregular
shape by squaring it off so that the total of the complete squares included in it added to that of
the nght-angled tnangles which fill in its contours gives an answer approximately correct then there
are hsts of weights and measures, and for those
whose studies had a more scholarly purpose there are introduced towards the end of our period
dictionaries in which Sumenan and Semitic synonyms are given in parallel columns Some of the
men and women thus trained lived on in the
temples as religious scribes, making fresh copies of
the ancient texts stored in the library of the god,
preparing the ‘books’ for the temple services,
hymns and litanies and so on, keeping the volu
minous business accounts of the institution and
putting on record the details of the legal actions
brought before the priestly courts, some even indulged in onginal research and might collect and
copy out the old inscnptions on brick or stone
which threw light upon the past history of their
own city it IS to the labours of these that we owe
most of what we have learnt concerning the hfe and thought of their time Other students went mto Government employ or used their accomplishments in pnvate business, but It is probable that members of the more

specialized professions, doctors, architects, &c , kept up their connexion with the temples Gudea, the patesi of Lagash in about 2400 b c , whose oflSce
was as much a religious as a civil one, holds on one of his statues a tablet with a plan of a temple
perhaps of his own design, plans of estates and of
canals, of houses and towns survive and most of these would be either for government purposes or for the use of the temples, the gods being landowners on a very large scale a map of the world
intended to illustrate the conquests of Sargon of Akkad (2700 b c ) was presumably drawn up at
the royal order, though m this case the powers of the geographer are by no means adequate to his task, but the idea of the umverse which it embodies
is clearly that of a school of religious thought. Medicine too was a curious mixture of surgery, herbahsm, and magic, and a large part of the
doctor’s stock-in-trade consisted of charms to exorcize the evil spmts which plagued the invalid, he
was as much a priest or a sorcerer as a man of
science. Surgical operations, based on a very limited empirical knowledge of the body, must have been hazardous and the law had to protect
the pubhc against unskilled or over-rash practitioners, in Hammurabi’s code, which embodies
regulations much older than his time, severe penal
ties are adjudged for failure and the surgeon



112 The Sumerians
worked at his own risk, ‘if a doctor shall operate on the eye of a man with a copper lancet and that man shall lose his eye, the eye of the doctor with a copper lancet they shall put out’, and if he
operate on a wound and the patient die, his hand is to be cut off, one may imagine that the surgeon preferred to use charms and simples rather than
the knife ^
The prosperity of Sumer depended on its agri
culture and on its commerce. The carefully irngated fields produced amazing crops of barley and spelt, omons and other vegetables grew along
the canal banks, and as early as 2800 b c the date
gardens were very extensive—a number ofvarieties of dates were cultivated, and the harvest afforded
one of the staple foods of the people A good deal of the land was the property of the temples and the king or governor would own his private estates, there were communal lands under collective ownership, but mdmdual nghts in land were very common and it was the rule rather than the exception for the countryman to have a small holding of his own a certain proportion of these
private possessions would be ilku lands granted by
the king to ex-soldiers, the tenure of which was inahenable and involved the duty of military
service The possession or the transference of land
was witnessed by wntten deeds of ownership.



Sumerian Society 1 13
The need to irrigate complicated matters because the same canal would serve many properties ^ for the upkeep of such all the owners of land watered by it were collectively responsible and
could be called upon for its clearing even when
their own interests were not directly concerned,
and similarly the use of water by different owners
had to be regulated, and disputes were frequent. A smallholder might of course cultivate his own farm, employing labour hired by the year and
paying wages m barley, wool, beasts, and sometimes in silver, if he were a poor man and compelled to borrow for seed-com, instruments, &c
,
perhaps mortgaging his field for the purpose, he received legal protection against his creditors until the harvest, and should that fail through no fault of his own, was excused interest on the loan Very often land was cultivated as a speculation by an outsider, the owner perhaps supplying seed-corn and receiving one-half of the yield or one-third if
he had supplied nothing, m the case of an orchard in bearing the owner’s share was two-thirds of the crop, while unplanted orchard land was let for a term of five years, four for planting, in respect of which no rent was paid, and one when the young trees would first bear and owner and tenant divided the yield equally. Failure to cultivate was severely
punished—^in the case of ilku land held from the

1 14 The Sumerians
Crown It involved confiscation—^while a tenant would have to compensate the owner on the basis of the average yield of neighbouring farms, simi
larly dishonesty on the part of the tenant, such
as the stealing of seed-corn, brought on him a heavy fine, and should he be unable to pay this he became a serf The plough was used at a very early time,
though the first picture that we have of one dates
only from the fourteenth century b c , it is fur
nished with a tubular seed-drill and is drawn by a yoke of oxen after harvest the corn was piled
in great heaps on the threshing-floor and round and round over it were driven ox-drawn sledges of
wood with flints set in their under side so as at once
to release the grain and to cut up the straw for
cattle-food, the same process and earned out with the same instruments as are in use to-day The gram was used for bread, ground to flour between
flat rubbing-stones, or was parched and bruised for a kind of porridge or brewed into beer, wine was manufactured from dates as well as from grapes,
and from dates was also made the thick honey-like
treacle called dibs by the modern Arab The cattle
and goats provided milk, cheese and the sour cooking-butter beloved of the East, and the nver and the canals yielded coarse fish, meat was
probably then as now rather a luxury for the rich,



Sumerian Society 1 1

and the poor man’s diet was mainly vegetanan^
though sacnfices on feast-days might relieve the monotony of his table
Thus Sumer was self-sufficing so far as the feeding of the population was concerned, as for their clothing also Wool was produced in abundance by the flocks scattered all over the country and flax for hnen was grown, especially in the north, something has been said about the cloth-factones managed by the temples, and besides these there were plenty of workshops run by private enter
prise m the later periods Babyloman stuffs were freely exported and fetched a high price in foreign markets and it is probable that the same is true of
the early penod also—^mushn may have been in demand thousands of years before Mosul gave its name to the fabric But everything else had to be imported The riches of the south country must have been largely due to the fact that its cities controlled the head of the Persian Gulf up which came the merchant vessels bnnging their goods from over sea one trade route led thence up the eastern bank of the Tigris to the north, and goods in transit for the Syrian towns passed up the Euphrates to the fords at Carchemish and so made their way south or north-west. By the same route, floated downstream in wooden boats which were broken up at their journey’s end, where the timber

ii6 The Sumerians
found a ready sale, came silver and copper ore, cedar from the Lebanon, walnut-wood, lye and
cystus-gum, but m the great days of Sumer the Gulf traffic must have been vastly more important than that from the north We have the bill of lading of a ship commissioned by the temple of Nin-Gal at Ur for the Gulf trade, it had been absent for two years at Dilmun when in the eighth year of Sumu-ilum of Larsa {c 2048 b c ) it unloaded on the quay at Ur, in its cargo were gold,
copper ore, ivory, precious woods, and fine stone
for the making of statues and vases. These raw matenals were worked up by the skilled craftsmen of Sumer and re-exported by the land routes to the west and north The merchants of the south had
their agencies or branch houses in distant towns with whom they kept up a correspondence and did
business by letters of credit, or they entrusted their goods to independent commercial travellers who sold to the best advantage and had to render
account on their return, receiving a share of the
profits, the law dealt hardly with such as failed to keep accounts or otherwise cheated their employers, but allowance was made for loss by robbery on the road Mention has already been made ofthe trading colony estabhshed at Ganes in Cappadocia
early in the third millennium b.c , before the reign of Sargon ofAkkad; in Syna there must have been

similar colomes, and in spite of slow commumca
tions, occasional oppression by local governors and
the raiding of caravans, the great houses of the
east carried on their business with these distant outposts and conducted much of it on very modern lines It must be remembered that there was no corned money and that all trade was by barter For local dealing values were generally reckoned
in barley—but for larger sums and for distant trade gold and silver were more workable stan
dards, the shekel of silver being the unit, in the period of Sargon of Akkad gold was worth eight times its weight in silver. Sometimes, undoubtedly, the metal was handled in a recognizable form,
ingots, rings, &c , which would facihtate reckomng, but even so the value had to be venfied by the
scales,—Abraham buying the cave at Macpelah
^weighed 400 shekels of silver, current money with
the merchant The manner of doing business may
be illustrated by a (later) letter from a merchant to
his partner living in another city, who has sent to him one Shamash-bel-ilam with a demand-note
for fourteen shekels, he writes T have sent to
Warad-ilishu two-thirds ofa mina ofsilver’ (i mina
= 60 shekels) 'and the receipt of that has been
acknowledged in wntmg m the presence of my witnesses He has gone to Assyria . . As concerning what thou hast wntten about the fourteen



ii8 The Sumerians
shekels of Shamash-bel-ilam, I have not paid him the money Catch Warad-ilishu and make him weigh out the silver with interest more or less;
from this sum take the fourteen shekels and send me the balance ’ In nearly every case a purchase had to be confirmed by a written and duly witnessed agreement,

to buy from a man’s son or slave without putting the matter in wntmg and having a formal receipt
was an offence severely pumshed by law* the conclusion of the bargain was signahzed by the buyer
giving a present over and above the agreed price,

the inevitable ‘baksheesh’ of the East Women
indulged in trade as freely as did men and con
tracts are frequently in their names For a business
system so far-reaching as that of Sumer credit was
necessary and borrowing was regulated by the
law, for loans of barley, that is, calculated on a basis of gram and payable in such, the maximum
legal rate of interest was 33J% per annum, and
for silver it was 20%, but money could generally be had on easier terms than these, at Ur dunng the Third Dynasty the silver rate, however, rose
to 25%, probably owing to the trade boom in the capital of the empire and the abnormally large
profits ansmg from the import business. The Government too, perhaps because it was so directly
interested owing to the wide possessions and busi



Sumerian Society 1 1
9
ness activities of the temples, which were essen
tially Government institutions, was always trying
to fix maximum rates for the hire of houses and
store-buildings, of ships, wagons and land, and to
regulate the wages of the different orders of labourers and artisans, such measures could only have a temporary success, but the fact that they
were made is an interesting comment on the economical problems of the time.
The Sumenan religion was polytheistic and its gods were innumerable All of them were recognized and honoured throughout the whole land, but in every city there was one chosen to be par excellence the patron and the pecuhar god of that city. At Babylon Marduk, at Larsa Shamash, at Ur Nannar, at Nippur Enlil, at Erech Inmni or Ishtar, was the owner of the principal temple, the
lord of the land, the governor of the State in time
of peace and the leader of its host m war, the other
gods might have their shnnes m the courts of his temple or might boast lesser temples of their own, but they were little more than attendants upon
his honour and offered no challenge to his supre
macy So far was he set above all others that his
isolation almost defeated its own purpose; he was too great to be approached by mere man, and every man therefore would have his own tutelary god, one ofthe minor deities, who acted as mediator between



120 The Sumerians
him and the city god and received his more
intimate and probably his more sincere devotion While ternfymgly aloof, the gods were at the
same time peculiarly close to man The religion was anthropomorphic and the gods were but men writ large, the temples were their houses in the city^s midst, where they hved a normal human life, eating the meats of sacrifice of which their wor
shippers also partook, marrying human women and having children by them, their ceremonies symbolized and secured the recurrence of the
seasons and the success of the crops in which, as
landlords, they were no less interested than were
men, they went to battle, and the defeat of an enemy was not complete unless his gods were brought as honoured captives into the palace of the divine lord of the city. In everything they shared
the prosperity and the disasters oftheir worshippers
the embodiment of the State, they rewarded virtue and punished social wrongdoers, but their rewards and their pumshments were hmited to this world The Sumenans had a very hazy idea about any other hfe than this For them there was no Hell
and no Paradise, the spint of man lived after death
but at best in a ghostly and a miserable world
Earth is their food, their nourishment clay,
Ghosts like birds flutter their wings there, On the gates and the gate-posts the dust lies undisturbed

Such was the ‘Land from which there is no return’ to which a man might win if respect were paid to his corpse, but if he were not duly buned,
if no offerings of food and dnnk were placed m the
grave to satisfy his needs, then his spint must haunt the streets and byways of this world and vampire-like attack benighted travellers in search
of food the offerings made to the dead were for
their comfort, but were also a protection for the
living In this after-life the gods played no part,
man’s devotion, and his prayers, aimed at temporal and material rewards, ‘To Nannar his King, Ur-Nammu for his own hfe has presented this’ is
the usual form of dedication, and when KudurMabug restores the temple Ga-nun-makh at Ur ‘for my life and the hfe of Warad-Sm my son’ he prays thus ‘Over my work may Nannar my King rejoice, a decree of hfe, a prosperous reign, a throne securely founded may He grant me as a gift, the shepherd beloved of Nannar may I be, may my days be long^’
All the gods had originally their functions Enki

each city naturally tended to usurp the provinces of others and a good deal of confusion in the pantheon resulted, one deity duplicating many parts
or similar functions being in different cities attri
buted to powers differently named even the ancient legends might be modified to suit the local cult, and the pre-eminence given to Marduk
in the story of the Creation is due to this political
bias,—as Babylon became the capital of the empire
Its patron god Marduk had likewise to take the lead in heaven The great Gilgamesh Epic with the stories of the Creation and the Flood, the legend of Etana who flew to heaven, of Adapa who broke the wings of the south wind, and of Tammuz who came back from the Under-world were from the earhest times
familiar and gave stock subjects for the artist, but
(with the exception of the elaborated TammuzAdonis myth) they were not of a kind to have any
moral influence on people’s hves, their picturesque
side might appeal to the vulgar, the learned might
read into them something of philosophy, but it reqmred the more spiritual imagination of the Semite to transform them into religion In the Sumenan legend of the Flood the gods are angry and decide to destroy the race of man by drowning, but Enki betrays the secret to Uta-Napishtim, a good man dwelhng in the village of Shuruppak on

ticular moral, that of the Creation with its bestial brood of Chaos, its cowardly gods, its hero Marduk who enters the conflict strengthened by magic spells, creates the firmament out of the body of the slam monster and, simply in order that the gods may be fed, makes man out of clay and dragon’s
blood, IS absolute barbarism, and the picture that
It draws of the gods could m no way commend them to man’s moral judgement The fact is that throughout the religion of the Sumerians is one
not of love but of fear, fear whose hmits are con
fined to this present life, fear of Beings all-powerful,
capncious, unmoral Somehow or other virtue does appeal to the gods (that this should be so seems to be rather a necessity of human nature than an attnbute of the godhead as conceived of in Sumer), but expenence shows that mere virtue IS not enough to engage and keep their favour,
practical rehgion consists in the sacrifices and the
ritual that placate and in the spells that bind them
The daily sacrifices made to the god were in
the nature of meals and were m fact shared by the priests and personnel of the temple, they consisted
of beer, wine, milk, bread and dates and meat of
all sorts; m a temple where there were several hundred persons to be fed the number of animals
killed was proportionately great, on feast-days
there was a special diet and those who were em



126 The Sumerians
ployed in the preparations for the ceremony were
treated to the best portions of the sacrifice Other ntes were of the nature of sympathetic magic and a symbolic act performed by the pnests was intended to prompt the god to exercise his power in
some particular direction, tlius the libations of
pure water poured into a vase containing ears of com and bunches of dates were meant to procure the due amount of water for the crops Pnvate sacnfices earned out in the temple were really
charms to secure an answer to prayer, bread, sesame wine, butter and honey and salt were
placed before the statue of the god and a beast was killed of which the god’s portion was the right
leg, the kidneys and a roast, while the rest would
be shared amongst the participants in the rite
In these cases the animal stood for the man, as the
liturgy was careful to explain—^The lamb is the substitute for humamty, he hath given up a lamb for his life, he hath given up the lamb’s head for
the man’s head’—and we have here a rehc of
human sacnfice such as was actually found in the graves of the prehistonc kings at Ur. In these
sacrifices there was so much magic and so little
religion that, in the case of a sick man praying for
health, for instance, the carcass of the victim duly dismembered was laid on the body of the offerer in order to punfy him of his complaint Medicine



Sumerian Society 127
was a well-recognized art and for every disease there was an appropriate drug to be prescnbed, but at the same time all sickness was brought about by the malignant spirits which thronged the universe and preyed on men, and while the doctor might deal with the physical s^nnptoms the demons
must also be exorcized Prominent m the priesthood then were the magicians whose duty it was to conjure away evil when it came, and next to them came the soothsayers who gave warning of Its approach and told how it might be avoided One form of soothsaying was closely connected with sacnfice, for from the shape and marking of
the victim’s liver the pnest took his omens, con
sulting a tablet in which all possible signs, favour
able and unfavourable, were descnbed, the British Museum possesses a clay model of a hver divided
up into fifty squares in each of which is written the
omen for that particular spot (cf. Ezekiel xxi 21) But every kind of accident, every chance event or unusual phenomenon had its meaning and its bearing on the future, generations of industrious
priests made record of these, noting that such and such a portent was followed by good happemngs or evil, and so compiled books of omens which could be consulted for future guidance Astrology was one of the most important branches of the magic art The Sumenans had already by observation



1 28 The Sumerians
acquired a little astronomical knowledge, and
since the sun and moon and the planets were
identified with gods the changes m the face of the
heavens reflected the dispositions of the gods and
were directly responsible for events on earth, the
student of the stars therefore might hold the key of
the future in his hands
In considering the pnesthood we have to re
member that the Sumenan state was essentially
theocratic The god of the city was in reality its
king, the human ruler, patesi (governor) or king,
was simply his representative—the ^tenant farmer’
of the god Civil and ecclesiastical ojBSces were not
clearly distinguished The king or governor was
himself a priest, in fact in the case of the patesi the
religious aspect was the older and in early days the
more important, when Lugal-zaggisi, who in Erech was priest of Anu, conquered all Sumer by
force of arms he established his claim to rule by
assuming priestly functions in the temple of Enlil, and Gudea as patesi of Lagash performed his own sacnfices and took his own omens, and when his son Ur-Ningirsu lost his temporal power he was
not stripped of his consecration as priest of Nina
The deification of the Sumerian kings-only earned to its logical conclusion the theory that they ruled in the name of god Conversely the high pnest of one of the larger temples was a person of great



Sumerian Society 129
political importance and was often chosen from the royal house Church and State were so inextncably mingled that while the State has to be regarded as a theocracy the Church must in part at least be judged as a pohtical institution and the
state religion as a political instrument It would be interesting to compare Sumer and Akkad under the Third Dynasty of Ur with the Roman Empire of the third century when the state worship of the gods of Rome and of the genius of Augustus and the city was a profession of political loyalty empty of
rehgious content, and men, if they believed, believed in other gods To the Sumenan the greater gods were something more than symbols, but they touched his life very hghtly, the priestly magic which dealt with demons and minor deities came closer, but we shall not understand what were his real behefs until we find out more about that domestic religion concermng which the temple texts are silent The chapels in the private houses
and the little clay figures (the teraphim stolen by Rachel in the story ofJacob) which we find in the rums of the houses and in the graves may mean simply more magic brought into the home, but equally they may bear witness to a faith more intimate, more simple and more genuine than that contained in the elaborate sacrifices and set liturgies of the church.



V
THE THIRD DTHASTY OF UR
A MONGST the local governors installed by
2^Utu-khegal was, apparently, Ur-Nammu patest of Ur, on mscnptions found at Ur he makes dedications to Nmgal the wife ofNannar on behalf ofhis suzerain. Then he revolted, conquered Erech,
and by a senes of victories made himself master of
the whole country; the fact that Kish, the old
Semitic capital, rebelled against ‘the Land’, i e
against the unification of Mesopotamia under
Sumenan rule, shows how truly nationahst was the king’s policy, he was not merely adding one more
chapter to the rather sordid history of nvalry be
tween city-states, he was aiimng dehberately at a
Sumenan revival m which Ur, his native city,
should take her old place as capital of the empire From the moment of his accession and throughout
his eighteen years of kingship he busied himself m
making the city worthy ofits position and in elevating to the front rank in the Mesopotamian pantheon the Moon-god Nannar, the patron deity of
Ur; not at Ur only but m other cities, such as Lagash and Nippur, was the Moon-god honoured by new temples and pubhc works called after his name On the other hand, Ur-Nammu would seem



The Third Dynasty of Ur 131
to have been content with establishing the theory of Sumenan supremacy, in his time and in that of his successors there was no attempt at repression of the Semites as such, they enjoyed equal status with the Sumerians, were eligible for all offices of State, and Ur-Nammu’s grandson, Bur-Sin, himself bore a Semitic name Such magnanimity was wisdom enforced The population of the south country was now too mixed to allow of invidious distinctions between its elements, for a long time the Sumerians had been steadily losing ground and undue favouritism ofthem would have brought immediate disaster, real umfication was the only statesmanlike course, and if the empire was to be extended by foreign wars, it was the more neces
sary to enlist for the army soldiers of the stouter Seimtic stock If the portraits of Gudea do indeed represent fairly the Sumenan ofhis day, it is evident that a softness and a degeneration had set in which would have made it impossible to win or to hold an empire by Sutnerian arms alone To the equal treatment meted out to all his subjects we may attnbute the many encomiums of the king’s justice, ^hemadejustice to reign’, Vickedness tamed not before him’, ‘the righteousness of Ur-Nammu, a treasure’ ‘King of Sumer and Akkad’ he called himself, and he appears to have deserved the double tide It was in accordance
K2



132
with ancient precedent that the king should be
deified m his lifetime, and Ur readily fell in with
the practice, but in contemporary inscriptions
from other cities the divine title is never added to the king’s name, and his worship seems to have been limited to his native place It may be that
inter-state jealousies were still too strong for Erech or Kish to accept the godhead of one who was primarily ruler of Ur, it may be simply that they doubted the permanence of an authority which had begun, as so many others had begun, with rebelhon and might itself fall a victim to the same, time and use were needed for factious grudges to be appeased and for the benefits of the regime to
win such recognition that the symbol of it might acquire more than mortal reverence, Dungi, Ur
Nammu’s son, by the twelfth year of his reign was adopted by all Sumer and Akkad as a god, We know very little of the wars of Ur-Nammu,
though there must have been such; foreign lands paid him tribute and trade flounshed along the
international roads, and this could hardly have
been without at least a show of arms, but the royal records which survive deal rather with the immense bmlding operations undertaken by the king. At
Ur he built the city wall, the great Ziggurat tower,
the temples of Nannar, Ningal, and Nin-e-gal, and
the royal palace, at Nippur his work was scarcely



The Third Dynasty of Ur 133
less comprehensive, at Lagash, Endu, Umma, Larsa, and Adah he founded or restored temples,
and he was no less active in that other task, indispensable in Mesopotamia, the digging of
canals
The waters of the Euphrates are so rich in silt that neglect to clean the channels will render them
useless m the course of a few years, again the river may shift its bed and suddenly disorganize the whole irrigation system Something of the kind may have happened during the penod of anarchy which preceded Ur-Nammu’s rise to power, for apart from his usual activity in canal building one
of his inscriptions implies that the old channels
had failed and that the province was suffering from drought and loss of waterways. It was charactenstic of Ur-Nammu that his first thought
in such a case was to propitiate the gods, and his restoration of the temple of the Moon-god Nannar was intended to avert the drought Tor Nannar, the eldest son of Enlil his King’, so runs the dedication, ‘Ur-Nammu the mighty man, king of Ur, king of Sumer and Akkad, who built the temple
of Nannar, gloriously restored its former state, saying “Open it!”, he saved the vegetables in the
garden plot, and the ships of Magan he restored to Its hand ’ In the immediate neighbourhood of the capital alone at least four canals were excavated



134 Sumerians
by his orders, one of them, as is implied above,
connecting the city directly with the sea so that the
trading-vessels of the gulf could unload on the quays of Ur, the canal of Nannar at Lagash was his work, and on his great stela found at Ur he
gives a whole list of others.
It IS clear that the mam energies of the king were
directed to the consolidation of his authonty at home, and he may have been content to leave to neighbounng states their independence, at least for a while, provided that they kept the peace and respected his merchant trams The limestone stela set up in the capital, the fragments of which have
been found in the rums, was intended to summarize
m
pictorial form the chief exploits of Ur-Nammu’s reign, those which would most command the gratitude of his people, judging from what remains of
It, ‘the merciful lord who brought prosperity to Ur’
deserved his title The stone, measunng five feet
across and perhaps three times as much in height,
was sculptured on both sides with rehefs arranged
m honzontal registers. Of the scenes only one, in
which bound prisoners are led before the king, has
to do with war The top scene on either side refers to the digging of canals whose names are wntten
below, the king IS shown standing in the attitude of worship and there flies down to him from heaven an angel holding a vase from which the water of



The Third Dynasty of Ur 135
fertility is pouring out upon the ground Another scene showed cattle and men milking them, the
two staple industries of Mesopotamia, the agn
cultural and the pastoral, had received the protection and encouragement of the king The
remaining registers illustrate his piety towards the
gods In one there is a scene of sacnfice, animals
being killed and libations poured out before an
altar m another the king himself makes his liba
tion to Nannar and to Ningal Here Nannar holds
m
his hand what appear to be the measuring-rod
and line of the architect, as if commanding the
king to build him an house; in the next scene below, Ur-Nammu obediently comes before the god as a workman beanng on his shoulder the tools
of the builder, and on another register is shown the
actual building in progress, men climbing ladders and laying the bncks of what must be the king’s greatest work, the Ziggurat of Nannar at Ur The
monument is in its spint a striking contrast to most of those whereby oriental monarchs have sought to perpetuate their memory; to turn from it to the
wall-reliefs of Ashur-natsir-pal with their scenes of
battles and the assault of cities, the enemy being
flayed alive or impaled on the battlements, the
scribes taking tally of the severed heads and hands, the captive gods being earned away from the flaming towns, is to understand at a glance the



136 The Sumerians
difference between the Sumerian and the Assynan
character Dungi, Ur-Nammu’s son, who reigned for fifty
eight years, fought many wars and reduced to the status of provinces within his empire the outlying countnes which his father seems to have left auto
nomous Some of these, especially the states east
of the Tigris, continued to give trouble throughout
his reign and time after time revolts had to be put
down by the royal armies, thus Lulubu was conquered no less than mne times On the other hand,
Susa, the seat of a palest^ remained loyal and con
tented,—^Dungi built there a temple to the god
Shushmak,—^Anshan, Kazallu, and Kimash were also governed by patesis^ but these were the only provinces east of the Tigns which could be brought into the regular organization of the empire, the
more intractable states to the north had no civil governors appointed to them and may have been ruled by something more like martial law Most of these conquests were made in the latter
half of the king’s reign, his earher years were spent
m consohdating what he had inhented from his father and in carrying out a policy which empha
sized the nationalist revival under the Third Dynasty. Dungi was as active a bmlder as had been Ur-Nammu, indeed the latter had not lived long enough to complete his programme of temple



The Third Dynasty of Ur 137
construction and there was plenty for Dungi to do even if he had not had plans of his own, but as a matter of fact his name is found on bricks and foundation-tablets throughout Sumer and Akkad
The chromcle states that Dungi ‘cared greatly
for the city of Eridu which is on the shore of the
sea’, Endu was traditionally the oldest city of Sumer and its temple of Ea the water-god was the most revered in all the south country, so that the king’s devotion to the place may well have had a
political motive. On the other hand, he laid waste the temple E-sagila at Babylon which had been rebuilt and endowed by Sargon and successive kings of Agade and was probably regarded as the rehgious centre ofAkkad; since Dungi had nothing material to fear from Babylon, as yet a town of no military importance, and so far from being gene
rally an iconoclast was everywhere building and
restoring the temples ofthe Sumenan gods, at Erech and Lagash, Nippur, Adab, Maer, and did not
hesitate to show honour to a foreign deity such as
Shushinak of Susa, this isolated act of destruction
must reflect the same nationahst pohcy as dictated his patronage of Endu. But at the same time the king was perfectly ready to make use of his Semitic subjects, and we find Semitic Babylonian names
amongst the governors of provinces it would seem that while he was anxious to foster the union of



138 The Sumerians
Sumer and Akkad, which indeed was essential if his empire was to endure at all, he was determined that the general colour of the union should be Sumerian Tablets found at Lagash throw light upon the very business-like orgamzation of the empire The local governors owed their appointment to the king as did also the minor officials, and though
their authority in their own provinces was con
siderable the admimstration was largely directed
from the central government at Ur, the patesi might himself have to report in person to head
quarters, couners passed frequently along the roads with instructions, and imperial officers were
dispatched from Ur on special missions inciden
tally this meant further orgamzation, for not only
had the roads to be kept in repair but provision
had to be made for the transport and rationing of
the officials passing through on business This centralization of government tended to weaken
greatly the power of Xh^patesis who m the old days
of hereditary office had always been potential
rebels against their overlord while their quarrels amongst themselves had often led to wars between
the city-states Only m Nippur did the patesiship
continue to descend from father to son, and there
as a particular concession to the religious sanctity
of the place, for some reason, possibly because the



The Third Dynasty of Ur 139
cult of Nannar of Ur was not taken up by the kingdom at large with any enthusiasm, Dungi and his
son Bur-Sin after him paid especial attention to
Nippur and elevated its god Enlil to the chief place
m the Sumenan pantheon, and every province was made to contribute to the revenues of its temple.
The raising of taxation and the dispatch of tri
bute to the capital and to the privileged temples
was one of the mam duties of Xhtpatesi^ since taxes were paid in kind it was important that weights and measures should be uniform, and Dungi established a fixed standard for the whole empire;
there was an official testmg-house at Ur, placed under the patronage of Nannar and attached to his temple, and a number of stone weights have been found there and elsewhere with inscriptions
testifying to their correctness and dating them to
the reign of Dungi The period must have been one of great prosperity Throughout the king’s whole long reign of over fifty years Sumer and Akkad enjoyed internal peace, foreign conquest had included within the boundaries of the empire many of the sources of supply of those necessary commodities which the delta Itself could not produce, the later wars were little more than raids which may well have paid for themselves by the booty they produced and the
slaves which they furnished for the army and for



140 The Sumerians
the public works. The tablets from Lagash giving
hsts of the sheep, cattle and asses belonging to the temple and details concermng the adnumstration of the temple domains prove how rich was the
shnne even of a provincial town, at the great reli
gious centre of Nippur the god Enlil possessed a
sacred farm, Drehem, where there was a receiving
station for the tithes and offenngs of cattle, grain, and fruit which poured in from all over the em
pire Private business tablets show that commerce
was no less prosperous, and the standard of life must have been higher than it ever was in later Mesopotamian history. The king had funds and
labour at his disposal suflScient for the most ambitious building schemes and the outward magmficence of his reign was in full accord with eastern
traditions, Bur-Sin, who succeeded him and
reigned for eight years, was almost as active a
builder as his father had been, and if the last two kings of the dynasty set up fewer monuments it
may well be because there was httle left for them
to build
From the excavations at Ur one can get some idea of what the capital of the empire was like in the palmy days of the Third Dynasty. Of the temples erected by Ur-Nammu and his descen
dants some survive to the present day, others were
rebuilt by later kings, but in that case the ground



The Third Dynasty of Ur 141
plan of the onginal was so faithfully followed

often indeed the foundations were the same—that the new work may be taken as a replica of the
old and can be used indifferently to complete the
picture
The outstanding feature of the city was the Ziggurat or staged tower Every great town in the land possessed a building of this type, which seems to have been a pecuharly Sumenan invention. One of the facts from which it is deduced that the Sumerians were by origin a hiU-people is that their gods are often represented as standing upon moun
tains; It would naturally follow that m their first home they worshipped their gods ‘on high places and on every high hilF. Coming into the alluvial plain of southern Mesopotamia those hill-folk were confronted with the difficulty that here were no
hills on which their ntes could decently be practised But the swampy character of the soil and the recurrent floods had from the outset taught the
earliest setders that their mud bmldings must be
raised on platforms, natural or artificial; a com
bination of this necessary precaution and of the
traditional idea of a hiU-temple resulted m the
Ziggurat, an artificial mountain. In so far as it was the base on which stood a shnne, the ziggurat was only the platform of the king’s palace wnt large, just as that in its turn was a more ambitious



142 The Sumerians
version of the platform of the commoner’s house
m so far as it was a hill,—and the ziggurat would have a name such as ‘the Mountain of God’ or ‘the
Hill of Heaven’—^it possessed a sanctity of its own
and was elaborately planned so that every part and every hne should have significance and symbolize the creed which it subserved The most famous ziggurat was that of Babylon, the ‘tower of Babel’
of Hebrew legend, now utterly destroyed, the Ziggurat of Ur, which in plan closely resembled that of Babylon, is the best preserved in Mesopotamia Ur-Nammu’s building, which occupied the site of an older and smaller ziggurat, is a rectangle measuring a little more than two himdred feet in length by a hundred and fifty feet in breadth and Its onginal height was about seventy feet, the angles
are orientated to the cardinal points ofthe compass
The whole is a solid mass of brickwork, the core of crude mud bncks, the face covered with a skin,
eight feet thick, of burnt bricks set in bitumen, at
regular intervals in the face there are ‘weeper’holes for draining the intenor and so preventing the mid bnck from sweUing and bursting the outer walls The walls, reheved by broad shallow buttresses, lean inwards with a pronounced batter
which gives a fine impression of strength, and it is noteworthy that on the ground-plan the base of each wall is not a straight line but convex, from



23.
THE
ZIGGURAT
OF
UR






The Third Dynasty of Ur 143
which again an idea of strength results—^it is the
same principle as was observed by the builders of the Parthenon. The upper terraces were curiously
irregular, narrow along the long sides, they were
broader at the ends of the building, so that the top
stage approximated rather to the square, and at the south-east end the bottom terrace was lower than
at the north-west, from it a central flight of stairs
led to the shrine on the top stage The approach
was on the north-east face Three stairways, each of a hundred steps, converged before a monumen
tal gateway on the level of the lowest terrace, the
two side staircases leant against the wall of the
ziggurat, the central flight running out boldly at
right angles from the building, the two angles
between the staircases were filled by buttresses with
sides of panelled bnckwork It is probable that
both the tops of these buttresses and the terraces of
the ziggurat itself were planted with trees m closer
imitation of the wooded hills ofthe Sumenan home
land As an architectural feat the ziggurat is remarkable Limited by his matenal, the architect has dispensed with ornament and rehed on mass and hne The design might easily have been both primitive and ugly, a mere superposition of cubes, as it
IS, while bulk predominates, all the lines, those of
the sloped outer walls and the sharper slant of the stairways, lead the eye inwards and upwards to the



144 Sumerians
temple which was the religious as well as the artis
tic crown of the whole structure This ethical idea
was emphasized by the horizontal division of the
terraces which contrast with but do not interrupt
the upward-converging hnes, in the late period at least, when the tower was restored by Nabomdus of Babylon, but probably in Ur-Nammu’s day
also, the stages symbolized the divisions of the universe, the underworld, the earth, the firmament of heaven, and the approach to the House of God passes through them all The Ziggurat stood on a high raised terrace
called E-temen-ni-il, surrounded by a double wall
Partly on this terrace and partly at its feet, below
the north-east face of the Ziggurat, lay the great temple of Nannar The shnne on the Ziggurat’s summit was the holiest place of all, but it was too
small to be the sole temple of so great a god and
the mam building had perforce to be elsewhere
The sanctuary of this lower temple stood against the north-west side of the tower, and on the lower stage stretched its wide outer court surrounded by
store-chambers and offices Since to every temple
there were attached lands more or less extensive, the produce of which either belonged to the god or
paid tithe to him, and since offerings in kind were
brought by tenants and by worshippers alike, nlentv of store snare was essential and the affairs









The Third Dynasty of Ur 145
of the god had to be run on business lines The
temple officials duplicated in title and in function
those of the king’s palace, besides the pnests proper there were ministers of the Harem, of War, of Agnculture, of Transport, of Finance, and a host of secretanes and accountants responsible for the revenues and the outgoings of the temple To the Ga-makh, the Great Storehouse, perhaps this courtyard below the Ziggurat, the countrymen
would bring their cattle, sheep and goats, their sacks of barley and rounds of cheese, clay pots of clarified butter and bales of wool, all would be checked and weighed and the scribes would give for everything a receipt made out on a clay tablet and would file a duphcate in the temple archives, while the porters would store the goods in the magazines which opened off the court. Immediately to the south-east of the Nannar temple lay another, E-N\m-Makh, which was sacred to the same god and to his wife Nin-gal. This was a building wherein a particularly secret form of ritual must have been practised, for there was here no wide court such as charactenzed most shnnes, but the sanctuary, a small square building contaimng an entrance lobby and two duphcate sets of two chambers, one for each of the deities its patrons, was hidden away in a maze of long vaulted rooms and was only approached by a narrow
3517 L



146 The Sumerians
winding passage, certainly the pubhc never were admitted here, and so small were the sanctuary
chambers that even the officiating pnests must
have been few in number Of the vaulted rooms which occupied most of the buildmg’s area some
were presumably storerooms, but others, judging
from the inscriptions found m them, were the
quarters of the Sal-Me priestesses, the women of
the god’s harem The head woman, the Nm-An,
was the god’s true wife, these others were his concubmes, they might bear children, but the fathers of such would never be known, they might marry, but to their human husband they must not bear a child, they owned property of their own and ear
ned on business in their own names,—contract tablets are often signed by the Sal-Me pnestesses, they were nch and honoured, forimng a class so different from that of the common temple prostitutes that they might boast of prmcesses in thenranks It was natural that such should be housed in what was really the harem temple of the Moongod E-Nun-Makh was a very ancient foundation,
dating back to the First Dynasty of Ur, but it had constantly been restored and had been completely
rebuilt by Bur-Sin important though it was m the
rehgious hfe of the city, it can have been known to most only from the outside, and the long blank
wall of It frontmg on the Sacred Way had no



The Third Dynasty of Ur 147
architectural ment to draw the attention of the
passer-by. Very different was the next temple, Dublalmakh The Sacred Way led through a double gateway into a large paved courtyard, at one end of which projected from the corner of the Ziggurat terrace a small but lofty building consisting of an inner and an outer chamber only The outer chamber was vaulted, the inner, even at this period, may have been surmounted by a high dome, but its most arresting feature was the huge arched doorway which occupied the greater part of the width of the fagade and was closed by doors elaborately adorned with silver, copper, and gold/ when they were open there could be seen an interior whose walls were enriched with a many-coloured incrustation ‘this house, the wonder of the land, he,
Bur-Sin, built for him, he finished it splendidly,
with gold, silver, lapis lazuli he adorned it’; against the back wall of the inner chamber stood the statue of Nannar The bmldmg had in early times been open to the sky and was really the entrance from the courtyard level to the terrace of the Ziggurat, and it never lost its name of ‘the Great Gate’. Bur-Sin
* The decoration of the doors is only proved for a later period, but the work done then was probably a reconstruction on ancient lines



148 The Sumerians
had roofed it and the back had been walled up so that the gateway was transformed into a shrine
with only small side-doors leading to the terrace,
but one of its functions survived the change, for
in old times the judges had sat here in the gate to
give judgement and still it was called ‘the Hall of Justice’ and from its steps, one can suppose, the
decisions of the courts were read to the public m
the courtyard and received their sanction as oracles coming from the Moon-god^s shnne. Round the courtyard were more store-chambers and workrooms, and in one corner of it the house of the keeper of the business archives of the temple Here there were found thousands of clay tablets
throwing light on the vanous activities practised
within the sacred precincts The vast quantities
of goods brought as tribute to the god and stored
m
his magazines were utilized for all sorts of pur

demands, inevitable in such a commumty as minis
tered to the temple, there were outgoings connected with the commercial interests of the god
Within the temple precincts there were regular factones where worked the women attached to the temple Thus the raw wool brought in by the country people was spun and woven on the premises, the ledgers of the factory give a nominal roll of the women, the weight of wool issued to each at the begmmng of the month, the lengths and weights of the specimens of cloth of various qualities which she produced at the month’s end (a due allowance is made for unavoidable wastage in the process of manufacture), and then in parallel columns the rations issued for her mamtenance dunng the period, so much grain and cheese and
cooking-butter, the whole making a profit-andloss account for the month In their book-keeping, as in everything else, the Sumenans were a most
business-like people, but the particular interest of
these tablets lies m the picture that they give of the
life led in the ecclesiastical buildings of the Third
Dynasty In one of the rooms by the courtyard there were found the remains of a smelting-furnace and a clay pot filled with scrap copper, here then the temple servants were employed in melting down metal, perhaps that brought in by the mer
chants of the city, into ingots for storage such as

were unearthed in another part of the building These temples resembled less a church than a medieval monastery wherein besides the purely rehgious observances there went on mdustnes of all kinds and the workshops and the schools were scarcely less important than the chapel From the courtyard of Dublal-makh a continuation of the Sacred Way led along the south-east wall of the Ziggurat terrace to the doors of another
temple, dedicated to Nin-gal, the wife of the Moongod From the outside, with its enormously massive walls and its angle towers, it must have looked like
a fortress rather than a rehgious building Double gateways with a guard-chamber between led into the outer court of the northern of the two temples
enclosed withm the great wall, the court of the lesser worshippers On to this opened a small sanctuary with a high statue-base immediately facing the door and visible from the court, on one
side the paved floor sloped to -a dreiin, the apsu, dovra which were poured the hbations to the god. Behmd the sanctuary lay a long narrow chamber, apparently an ablution-place, through which one
passed into the inner court, from this two doors, set in an ornamental fagade decorated with elaborate buttresses, led through htde anterooms into the holy of hohes, a long and shallow room, against the back wall of which stood the stepped altar and

the benches for the statues and the sacred vessels
This temple formed one of the three sections into which the whole building was divided, the central block contained at one end the hving quarters of
the priests, and their graves, for they were buried
beneath the floors of their houses, and at the other
end a maze of winding passages, in the centre of which was the cult chapel of King Bur-Sin, the temple’s founder An older shnne of Nin-gal, the work of Ur-Nammu, seems to have occupied the site, but It was razed to the ground by his grandson to make room for his own more ambitious building, but Bur-Sin’s temple was of crude mud bnck, and about a hundred years after its foundation It was rebuilt in burnt bnck by one Enannatum, pnnce of Ism and high pnest of Nannar at Ur, but the new temple was a faithful reproduction of the old and Bur-Sin as first founder continued
to receive his divine honours. At one end of the chapel room a tall oval-topped stela of white limestone was set up, inscnbed with the king’s titles
and the record of the temple’s building, two grey
marble stelae similarly inscribed lay at its foot
embedded m the bitumen covenng of the floor, and round these would be grouped the symbols of power, maces and standards, with sacrificial
vessels on the bench against the wall through two doors at the other end the worshipper would pass



152 The Sumerians
across the room, pausing to pay his respects to the dead king The third section, occupying the south-eastern end of the enclosure, was a second temple of Nm
gal built on quite different hnes from the first The outer court was reduced to little more than a
passage and led directly into the central court which was the mam feature of the building In the north corner stood a bnck bitumen-proofed water-tank and beside it a low stone column where
on stood the laver or ablution-stoup, probably of
metal In the centre of the south-west side was the
entrance to the sanctuary, in front of the door, almost blocking it, was the altar, probably metal
sheathed, and flanking it, against the wall, brick
bases on which stood statues and inscribed stelae
Three great archways led to the sanctuary, a tiny
square no deeper than the thickness of the arch,
entirely filled by the brickwork of the statue-base and by the lower platform, approached by a flight of steps, whereon the priest mounted to make his
oblation between the arches were narrow vaulted chambers with bnck benches against their walls,
these were the subsidiary chapels to the minor
deities who formed the goddess’s retinue On one side of the sanctuary was the treasury, on the other
the bedroom of the goddess; behind these lay magazines (in one the great oil-jars were found

still standing in their places) and the temple
kitchen This was a very necessary feature of the
temple and occupied quite a large space, there
was an open court with a well and fireplaces for
heating water and a brick table for the cutting up of
the carcasses of the ammals, here too the grain was ground on flat saddle-shaped querns ofhard stone, off it opened two roofed chambers, one containing
the beehive-shaped bread-oven, the other the cooking-range of fire-clay with flat top and circular flues, here were prepared the meals both of
the goddess and of her pnests and servants South-east of the Gig-Par-Ku, the temple of
Nin-gal, stood the houses of some of the pnests,
then more temples—these too ruined now for their
character to be certainly known, and then a large and massive building of burnt brick which would appear to be the royal palace whose construction was begun by Ur-Nammu and finished by his son Dungi One part of it was residential and divided into two sections, perhaps the men’s quarters and
the harem respectively, for whereas one was easy of access, the other was approached only by roundabout ways through several doors the major part contained the public rooms where the king gave audience It has been remarked already that the personnel ofthe temple duplicated that ofthe king’s
court. It was also true that the temple, as the god’s



The Third Dynasty of Ur 155
house, reproduced the features of the palace of the
earthly ruler. The king upon his throne received the
obeisance of his subjects, the statue on its base that
of the god’s worshippers, it was a difference of de
gree only, and that difference was very small in a country where custom deified the king. Consequently we find that this part ofthe palace is scarcely to be distinguished from a temple in the arrangement ofits outer and inner courts, its antechambers, and Its sanctuary-like throne-room; the sacred
character of the home of the divine ruler was
further emphasized by the fact that it lay within,
though on the outskirts of, the Temenes, the great terraced and walled area within which stood the Ziggurat and all the temples described above, the
core of the city and its ultimate stronghold
For all these buildings were linked together to
form a single complex known as E-gish-shir-gal,
and though each possessed its particular name and function, all were included in the Temple of Nannar’ in the wider sense of the word The enclosure measured some four hundred yards by two hundred and might be compared to the keep of a medieval castle; round it, correspondmg to the
bailey, stretched the inner town, its houses closely huddled together inside the great enceinte wall built by Ur-Nammu, and beyond that, along the river-bank and between the canals, lay the suburbs.

giving to the city a total length of about four miles and a width of a mile and a half In the town narrow and irregular streets ran between high blank walls pierced only by doorways; they were unpaved and undramed, there was no wheeled traffic in the town, carnage was by porters or by
donkeys, and occasionally against the wall of a house there would be a mounting-block for the convenience of nders and the corners of the bmld
ings were rounded off to give easier passage to the
beasts of burden. In the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur and of the succeeding dynasties of Ism and Larsa the
well-to-do citizen was housed remarkably well The ordinary private house conformed more or less to a recognized type, modified merely by the means of the owner and the exigencies of ground-space, the general idea was that of a quadrangle facing
inwards on to a court which served as light-weU for all the rooms The front door opened into a httle lobby, sometimes provided with a water-jar and a drain for the washing of the feet of those entering,
from which one passed directly into the central court, this was paved with brick and in the middle was a drain, a smaU opemng in the pavement below which was a round pipe, 20 or 30 feet long,
made of terra-cotta nngs set one above the other;
there were holes in the sides of the rings and round






158 The Sumerians
them there was a packing of broken pottery which kept the earth from blocking the holes, it was a seepage dram allowing the water to percolate away mto the subsoil The house was two stories high and was bmlt of bnck throughout, the lower
courses of burnt bnck, the upper of crude bnck, but as the walls seem to have been plastered and
whitewashed all over the difference of matenal would not have been noticeable The ground-floor
rooms had no windows at all—such are indeed
unnecessary m this country of strong suns—^but denved all their hght and air through their high arched doorways, the same was probably true for the most part of the upper rooms also, but here the
evidence is lackmg A staircase, the lower treads
built of bnck, the upper of wood, led from the court to a wooden gallery runmng round the inside of the house and givmg access to the first-floor rooms, which were the living-quarters of the
family, the roof made of mud laid over matting and beams, almost flat but sloping slightly in
wards, projected so as to shelter the gallery and
left only a comparatively small opemng over the middle of the court, from its edge gutters stuck out so as to carry the rain-water into the dram
below Of the groimd-floor rooms the largest, generally facing the entrance firom the street, was the guest

chamber or reception-room The kitchen, with its brick fireplace, was another room, and below the
stairs was a lavatory with a drain in its paved floor, while another room was probably for the domes
tic servants In some of the houses there was also
a private chapel, this was a small chamber, rather narrow, with the pavement at one end slightly
raised and on it, against the back wall, a bnck
altar, either behind the altar or in the side-wall
close to It there was a mche or recess intended to
receive the cult figure, painting or clay statuette,
and close to the altar again a square pillar of bnck
set against the wall, the meamng of which we do not know A normal house might therefore contain twelve to fourteen rooms, and though none of these were very large the total accommodation was on a generous scale, of course there were houses smaller than this, and there were others in which a second courtyard with its surrounding chambers might bring the number of rooms to over twenty in any case the size of the house, its arrangement,
and the quality of its construction show that the standard of hving was remarkably high and that the public prosperity of the Third Dynasty penod was reflected in the comfort of domestic hfe Of the furmture and decoration of the rooms
we Idiow httle The interior walls were mudplastered and whitewashed, the floors spread with



i6o The Sumerians
matting, but of the actual furniture nothing remains and we must rely upon sculptured repre
sentations and notes from inscnbed tablets There
were low tables for eating at, often with crossed
legs, stools and high-backed chairs with rush seats and cushions, the woodwork of which in wealthy houses might be encased in silver or copper, and
beds with wooden frames filled m with stnng-work or rush, the bedstead might have a tall head-board
decorated with figures of birds or flowers House
hold vessels were of clay, copper, or stone, baskets and chests made of clay or wood served for storing
the clothes of the family Rugs and carpets
adorned the rooms of the better class At a later penod, and perhaps thus early too, there might be
affixed to the wall of the room near the door clay
rehefs representing gods or demons, these were in the nature of amulets intended to protect the in
mates against the spirits of evil and to avert death Under the nave of the chapel, ifthe house boasted such, and if not, under the pavement of any one of the ground-floor rooms, was the burymg-place of the family In most cases this was a brick vault which was opened and reused for each member of the house that died The dead man, wrapped in matting and wearing his clothes and
personal trinkets, was laid in the vault on his side (the bones of the last occupant being unceremom

ously bundled away into a comer) with a cup of water held to his lips, the door of the tomb was bricked up, two or three clay vessels contaimng food were leant against the blocking, the earth put back and the brick pavement relaid over the hole Sometimes instead of the family vault we find an individual grave, the body laid on the ground at the bottom of the shaft and a bath-shaped clay coffin inverted over it, children are often buned in clay jars or in a bowl over which a second bowl IS set upside down as a lid The custom of burying the dead immediately below the floor of the house seems a strange one, yet it was the general rule Sometimes, but rarely, occupation ceased after the interment, the front door was walled up and the empty house became a mausoleum, but usually the family continued to hve there and the vault was penodically re-used (it is not uncommon to find ten or more bodies in a tomb, and under the floor of one chapel there were thirty infants’ graves)
,
It must have been insanitary, and not merely single houses but whole quarters must, one would suppose, in time have become virtually uninhabitable,
if this were the case the desertion of a number of houses might help to account for the surprising
extent of many ancient Babylonian sites,—the area occupied by the towns is so great and the buildings are so congested that the population

seemingly implied exceeds all likelihood, the facts would be more easily understood if we could suppose that at any one time a fair proportion of the houses and even whole districts might be occupied
only by the dead At the close of the third millennium b c burial customs had been modified and the graves of the Third Dynasty contain no such wealth of objects as come from the cemetenes of the fourth millen
mum to illustrate the art and industries of the early penod Gold ear-rings, sometimes of very delicate
granulated work, are almost the only things that
represent the goldsmith’s craft, the clay and copper
vessels are simple and of little interest, though
rarely a vase of glazed fnt bears witness to a new techmque, and the most important documents for art are the cyhnder seals The deep and bold engraving which had made of the seals of the Sargomd age works of the ‘grand style’ in miniature has by now given place to a cutting more
meticulous, very assured, regular and clean, but
invention and design have suffered. The subject IS monotonously the same and only the details change; the owner of the seal is shown being led by his particular patron deity into the presence of
Nannar or some other of the greater gods, but in
spite of this limitation many of the seals are extra
ordinarily fine and the royal seals are ventable



The Third Dynasty of Ur 163
gems of engraving In staking contrast to these are
the terra-cottas, the other most interesting objects
from the graves, for here the execution is summary
—though the moulds may well have been better than the rough impressions struck from them
would lead one to suppose—but the subjects are more varied and the treatment is strong and free
The terra-cottas, either figurines in the round taken from a two-piece mould, or reliefs, represent gods and their worshippers, in the case of the latter the range of types is limited, or rather there
are a great many repetitions of the same types showing only minor vanations and a smaller number of more individual pieces, but the god figures possess the peculiar interest of being in many
cases copies, more or less free, of the cult statues
m the temples, so that from them we can get some idea of the great works of sculpture It was inevitable that most of the latter should disappear, if they were of metal they have been melted down, if of stone they have been smashed by iconoclasts and their fragments dispersed, they were not hidden away in graves where they might have been preserved, but exposed in temples to the covetousness or mahce of any enemy, and even the rough clay copies of them therefore possess especial value How fine the originals were is shown by the
httle salvage that is left; two female heads from

Ur, one in black dionte, one in white marble with
eyes inlaid with shell and lapis lazuli, illustrate an
art unsuspected before in Mesopotamia In the short period that had elapsed since the making of
the Gudea statues the Sumenan sculptor has
advanced not only m techmque but in his ideals, here there is the defimte staving after beauty which inspired the Greek artist but is seldom
found amongst the natives of hither Asia, it requires no effort, no special understanding of an ahen mentahty to appreciate such works of art as
these The great stela of Ur-Nammu also is very
fine but, partly because the subjects are more
stereotyped and partly because the medium of
bas-relief was more m use and by use more con
ventionalized, it lacks the spirituality of the heads and if compared with the stela of Gudea betrays
but shght signs of progress It is cunous how httle matenal we have for judgmg the art of the Third Dynasty, considenng that this was one of the great
penods m Sumenan history and probably one of the most productive, and for the most part there is nothing to mdicate that the craftsmen of the time were even on the level of those of a thousand years
before, indeed, there would seem to have been a steady process of degeneration implying that the Sumenan gemus was played out, only architec
ture and sculpture m the round, two arts which

answer the demands and require the patronage of
an imperial and luxurious age, equal or outstrip
the efforts of a younger civihzation From Dungi, at the end of his long and pros
perous reign, Bur-Sin inherited the title 'King of
Ur, king of the four quarters of the earth’ together
with the vast empire which justified the boast,
and on his accession he was admitted, as his father had been, into the pantheon of the empire’s gods It IS noteworthy that he, his son, and his grandson
alike have names Semitic m form, and this may well have been a concession to the growing power of the Semitic race The expansion of the empire westwards had made such concessions more
pohtic, for besides the Akkadians the ruler of Ur had now to reckon with the Amorites of the upper Euphrates and ofnorthern Syria, while to the north the Semitic-speaking land of Assyria had become an important province ruled by a governor appointed from Ur (the name of one Zanqu, the governor, is preserved on a tablet in which he
dedicates a temple to 'hns Lady Belti-Ekallim, for the hfe of Bur-Sin the mighty, king of Ur’) The
mixed character of the empire is well illustrated
by a collection of tablets found m Cappadocia, at
Kultepe m the Halys basin here there was a trading colony whose merchants used Sumerian seals and employed Sumerian scribes, but their



1 66 The Sumerians
language, a dialect of Semitic, connects them not
with the south country but with Assyria, and the names of the months and the system of dating by eponym officials is another link with Asshur, the
dependence of the outlying parts of the realm on the capital city must have been loose Sumer had gained its position through moral and cultural supremacy, now that rivals had learned so much the maintenance of power required a force which
Sumer by itself could not afford and to secure it the Semites had to be placated and employed
During the reign of Bur-Sin policy prevailed the only wars which he had to wage were against the turbulent mountaineers of the Zagros range Gimil-Sm, who succeeded him after mne years,
also had to face troubles eastwards of the Tigns, but the mere record of his campaign fails, perhaps
deliberately, to give a full picture of the decay
which was already setting m The palest of Lagash, a city in the heart of Sumer, w2ls made governor of
Urbillum (the district of Arbela), of Subartu, Khamasi, Gankhar, Gutebum, and Kardaka It is obvious that this man, Arad-Nannar, could not from Lagash, where he continued to reside, adequately admimster a number of distant provinces east of the Tigns, precisely those which most con
sistently gave trouble and required firm control on
the spot, yet the fact that after the third year of



The Third Dynasty of Ur 167
Gimil-Sm no local governors of those provinces are mentioned proves that Arad-Nannar was not exercising his powers by proxy We must conclude
that he was patesi in partibus infidelium and that the
provinces in question had shaken off their alle
giance to Ur Susa still kept to its allegiance and patesi could build a temple in honour of the king of Ur, but that he should have a new title, ‘Master
of the defences’, shows that the position was none
too secure Equally symptomatic is an inscription from Umma recording the building by Gimil-Sin of the wall ‘Munk-Tidnim’, the ‘Wall which keeps off the Tidanu’ or Amontes of the Anti-Lebanon. Former emperors had preserved their western
trade-routes by more offensive action, this building of a wall tells not only of danger in the west but of weakness in dealing with it Disaster was not long delayed Ibi-Sin in the
early years of his reign is still mainly concerned
with the hill-people of the north-east, and his wars against them and against Susa and Anshan seem
to have been successful, though his victories do not
appear to have resulted in any recovery of terri
tory, at least there are no mentions of officials appointed to rule the rebellious provinces where the fighting had taken place That few monuments mentionmg his name are extant and that outside Ur Itself business documents dated by his reign



1 68 The Sumerians
all fall within its earlier years may be due to the
acadents of survival and does not necessarily imply any gradual loss of empire, so far as we
know, when after twenty-five years the end came. It came suddenly
An Amonte, Ishbi-Irra of Man, rose in revolt and marching down from the middle Euphrates invaded Akkad, he occupied the city of Ism and opened negotiations with Elam Ibi-Sm sent orders to the governor of the province of Kazallu
to take action against the rebel, probably he hoped to cut communications between the conspirators
and at the same time to crush his enemy m the north by a flank attack But the attempt, what
ever it was, was unsuccessful While Akkad was in the hands of the Amontes the Elamite forces crossed the Tigns and overran Sumer, ‘Ur was smitten with weapons’ and its unfortunate king taken captive and carried away to Anshan The ruins of Ur bear witness to the savagery with which the Elamites revenged their long subjection to its
rule; the great braidings of the Third Dynasty have shared a common fate of wanton destruction,
the sacred vessels of the temples, the treasured
offerings of ancient kings, were looted, and such as were not worth carrying away were smashed to pieces; it was now that the stela of Ur-Nammu was broken up, so that fragments of it were used as



The Third Dynasty of Ur 169
building material in the succeeding age the im
penal city was utterly laid waste
When they overthrew, when order they destroyed Then like a deluge all things together (the Elamite) consumed Whereunto, Oh Sumer • did they change thee^ The sacred dynasty from the temple they exiled, They demolished the city, they demolished the temple, They seized the rulership of the land By the command of Enlil order was destroyed. By the Storm-Spirit of Anu hastening over the land it was seized away Enlil directed his eyes towards a strange land The divine Ibi-Sin was earned to Elam
So runs a lamentation of which the text has been found at Nippur, and throughout all later history the name of Ibi-Sin was associated with the omens
of disaster



VI
ISIN AND LARSA
T
he poet of Nippur was right when in his lamentation over the downfall of Ibi-Sin he spoke not of Ur alone but of Sumer, for the fate of the city involved that of the whole land and people From the destruction wrought by the Amorites and the Elamites the Sumenans never recovered and their history as an independent nation stops
at this point For a long time the process of decay had been going on, by intermixture with Akkadians and other Semitic-speakmg stocks the purity of the race had been lost and the numbers of those who could call themselves Sumenans had diminished until they formed a minonty only of the population, parallel with this physical decay there
had been a moral degeneration which is reflected in the art of the people, where softness has taken the place of strength and convention has swamped ongmality When the political predominance which had been precanously won and upheld by collaboration with the Akkadian element was now violently wrested from them they had not energy to recover it On the other hand, old traditions of mdependence and hegemony died hard, and abortive attempts were made by different cities



IsinandLarsa 171
and at various times to revive the glories of the past the only result was to plunge the country into a welter of civil war and to usher in once
more an era of division into city-states. Ism, Larsa, Erech, Sippar, Babylon, and Kash were to have
kings of their own, and in their squabbles the manpower and the morale of the south country was
frittered away
Ishbi-Irra established himself at Ism and foun
ded a dynasty which lasted for five generations and enjoyed fairly wide dominion, from the outset he obtained control of Ur, whose rums his successors
took It in hand to rebuild, Erech, and part at
least of the north country; possibly the rule of Ism
stretched on occasions as far as Nineveh But at
the same time an independent state arose at Larsa,
only seventy miles from Ism at the head of the marshes which extended along the east bank of the lower Euphrates to the head of the Persian Gulf That this should have been possible is cunous and difficult to explain in view of the undoubted power of the Ism kings who were scarcely hkely to be patient of a rival so close to their doors
It has been suggested that the explanation hes in
the inaccessible character of the marshes which in
later history formed the domain of the ‘kings of the Sea Lands’ and seldom acknowledged the
control even of the great rulers of Babylon, their



1 72 The Sumerians
scattered inhabitants might easily defy a power which could overawe the cities of the west bank,
exposed to the attack of land troops, and the
natureil political base for them would be on the
marsh’s edge, to the north, where they could hnk
up with the trade-routes of the nver valley There IS much in this view to commend it, but even so the difficulty remains that though the marshlands were safe from mvasion the city of Larsa, the core
of their resistance, was open to assault and the
terram favoured the attackingforces rather than the
marshmen, who would find it not easy to reinforce
the defence, yet Ism does not seem to have at
tempted a blow at the rival capital, on the con
trary the relations between the two cities remained
fnendly throughout the reign of Ishbi-Irra’s dynasty The mfluence of Elam may account for this. For the overthrow of the Third Dynasty of Ur the kmg of Anshan and Ishbi-Irra of Man had made common cause and the former had appar
ently borne the brunt ofthe campaign m the south, he would naturally expect his share in the spoils of
war, temtonally as well as in the form of loot, yet
there is no sign of any direct Elamite control permanently influenced over Sumer, it would not be
rash to conclude that control was exercised indirectly and that Naplanum, who founded the Larsa dynasty, was a nominee and vassal of the



Ism and Larsa 173
Elamite king As such, supported by the redoubtable armies of Anshan, Larsa might well be immune from attack by Ism even after the bond of alliance between Anshan and Ishbi-Irra had
worn thin, hostilities between the two cities only begin at a time when Larsa was in revolt against
Elam and had to rely on its own strength
So frankly acknowledged was the prestige of Sumer that the conqueror from Man at once transferred his capital from the middle Euphrates to Ism, and so impregnated was even the Amonte north with Sumenan culture that his immediate task was the rehabihtation of the Sumenan towns
laid waste by the invaders At Ur the names
of Gimil-ilishu, Ishme-Dagan and Lipit-Ishtar appear constantly on the bncks of temples once
destroyed by Elam Gimil-ilishu brought back to Ur the statue of Nannar which the Elamite conquerors had earned off to Anshan Ishme-Dagan revived old memones by adopting the title ‘ELing of Sumer and Akkad’, and Enannatum, the son of Lipit-Ishtar, was made high pnest of Nannar and during his term of office rebuilt the great temple of Nin-gal which Bur-Sm had founded An optimist might have thought that a Sumenan
renaissance was stiU within the bounds of possibihty although the ruhng power had been usurped by Semites



174 The Sumerians
For one moment such hopes seemed to be justi
fied, for Lipit-Ishtar came to a violent end (the details are unknown) and was succeeded on the throne by one Ur-Ninurta who, whatever his origin, IS shown by his name to have been of Sumerian stock. He claimed domimon over ‘the four quar
ters of the earth’ and did m fact control the western
delta from Nippur to the sea his rise to power involved almost immediate hostilities with Larsa Gungunum of Larsa had been on excellent terms with Ism, so much so that when Enannatum built his temple he made of it an offering for the life of Gungunum, implying for Libit-Ishtar a fnendship
little short of vassalage, and Larsa was not likely to welcome the advent of a Sumenan adventurer to the Ism throne Gungunum was at the time engaged with a war, perhaps a revolt, against Elam, but as soon as that was brought to a successful conclusion he set his house in order against his
new enemy and built forts and a city wall as a prehminary to war The first clash of arms was in favour of Ur-Enurta and Gungunum was appar
ently killed on the field, but his son Abi-sare earned on the struggle and seemingly with more
success, no records deahng with the vicissitudes of
the war survive, but at Ur, a stronghold of the Ism kings and one of their mam possessions in Sumer, the names of Ur-Enurta and his successors fail



Ism and Larsa 175
altogether whereas Abi-sare, Sumu-ilum and the
following kings of Larsa all have monuments to
their credit, it can only mean that the city had
passed from the hands of Ism to those of Larsa as
early as the time of Abi-sare if not in the days of
Gungunum and Lipit-Ishtar, and that the title assumed by Ur-Enurta, ‘benefactor of Ur and
Eridu’, was m the nature of an empty boast The attempted ‘Sumenan revivaF had not seriously affected Ur except that it brought a change of masters, before long another change came The independence won or maintained by Gungunum through his war with Anshan was ill tolerated by Elam, and Sumu-ilum by his campaigns directed against Kazallu must have further embittered
relations without adding to his territory A new
power had ansen m the north, where Western Semitic immigrants had established an indepen
dent dynasty m Babylon and by mtrigue or conquest were making themselves a real danger to
the southern monarchies, a fresh revolution had brought to an end the Sumenan dynasty of Ism without improving the relations between that city and Larsa, Nur-Adad was able to keep the peace
for the space of sixteen years, but Sm-iddinam was faced with a war against Elam, now in alhance with
Ism, and after two more short reigns by kings of his house we find an Elamite on the throne of Larsa



176 The Sumerians
The details of the campaign are not known, but Kudur-Mabug of Elam, probably in alliance with Ism and Babylon, invaded Larsa, crushed Silli
Adad, who had only reigned for one year, and or
ganized It as a vassal state under the rule of his son Warad-Sm, with Larsa went Ur, Eridu, Lagash, and Nippur, Erech was a separate bngdom also perhaps subj ect to Elam For all practical purposes
the delta was now divided into three states, Larsa, Ism, and Babylon, with the growing power of
Assyria to the north, of these Ism and Babylon
would naturally tend to gravitate together, Ism and Larsa were bound first to come to blows and there could be little doubt that Larsa was the stronger of the two. Rim-Sin who succeeded Warad-Sin, after
many campaigns m which he had sometimes to meet Babyloman forces allied with his immediate enemy, in the thirtieth year of his reign captured and
laid waste the city of Ism and set the stage for the
final struggle between the Babylonian Semites and the South It was the obvious pohcy for the Larsa kings,
foreigners as they were, to placate Sumerian feel
ing m order to win support against Babylon Kudur-Mabug began by strengthening the de
fences of the city of Ur although his political
capital was at Larsa, the old impenal city came in
for much attention on his part, and for control of



Ism and Larsa 177
the south It was essential, moreover, Ur gave him the command of the head of the Persian Gulf, with which Ur-Nammu’s canal afforded direct communication for ships, and therefore of the sea-borne trade, still a factor of tremendous importance The Ziggurat with its walled terrace has been described as the ultimate stronghold of the city, an earlier king of Larsa had strengthened with a revetment of burnt brick the original mudbnck wall of the terrace, Kudur-Mabug added to this a comer fort with tower and sally-port, and both he and his successor Rim-Sin were lavish in building new temples and in restoring old, their bmldmgs have for the most part perished, but their inscribed foundation-cones bear witness to their pious zeal In this too the Elamite conquerors were following the example set by the native kings of Larsa, Nur-Adad had rebuilt E-Nun-Makh, the temple of Nannar and Nin-gal, both he and his son Sin-idmnam restored the ziggurat of Endu, the ancient centre of the worship of Ea, and at Ur Sm-idmnam and all three of the succeeding kings
of his line, including even the short-lived SilhAdad, left their record in temple-construction Sumerian rehgion had been so readily adopted by the Semitic subjects of the old empire that the possession of its ancient sacred places was a valuable asset and the pious care of its temples was a

178 The Sumerians
bid for the support not only of Sumerian national
ists but of a far wider circle of believers The
rehgious weapon was particularly effective as
against Babylon at this period, for the western
Semites installed there were pushing the claims
of the local Semitic god Marduk, who had hitherto
commanded slight allegiance outside his own boundanes, but must now needs assume a preeimnence proportionate to the political influence
of his city, against this upstart the south could
muster the forces of tradition, and Akkadians as well as Sumerians might be expected to answer to the appeal This is probably the reason why in the decadence of the Sumenan nation we find the period of their
greatest hterary and historical activity. It was
under the Larsa Dynasty that the scribes took in hand the composition of those historical works of
which the King-lists are a digest and the late Babyloman Chromcle an echo. They collected the books of Omens and not only explained the meaning of the signs in the hver of the sacrificial
victim or of natural phenomena but illustrated them by precedents drawn from history, they redacted the temple hymns, they set down in writing the old legends which told of the cosmogony, the Deluge, the deeds of the demi-gods, and they drew up the list of the official pantheon. It



Ism and Larsa 179
IS a strange fact that the great days of the Third
Dynasty of Ur have left us virtually no trace of
any literary records of this sort, the antiquanan
zeal of the scribes was only kindled in the deca
dence, but these by their studious labours set the
seal to the conquest which their forefathers had
made with the sword The Semitic-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia, Akkadians, Amontes, Assynans, had accepted Sumerian religion together
with Sumerian culture, that religion was now
reduced to a system, and that system inspired by
intense Sumerian patriotism and intolerance of anything foreign, and so complete was the moral subordination of the Semites that even this almost defiant mamfesto of a conquered and dying race acquired pontifical authority Not a single Semitic
god found his way into the official pantheon or was mentioned in the hturgies, even though he
might still have a place m popular worship The forms of service as well as the stories concerning the gods were fixed according to purely Sumerian
traditions, but the Semites translated into their own tongue the canon from which everything
Semitic had been so sedulously excluded, and two thousand years later the Assynans of Nineveh were still bound by the legacy of a people whose very name they had forgotten.
But for this the historian of the Sumerians might



i8o The Sumerians
have concluded his task with the lamentation over the downfall of Ibi-Sin as it is, the long-drawn death-agony of the race is of importance because It gave them time to assure their immortality
No sooner was the work done than final disaster
overtook Sumer Under the kings of Larsa they had enjoyed favour though depnved of independence, Rim-Sin, after his conquest of Ism which made him master of the whole south country, was
necessarily the champion of Sumer as against the western Semites of the First Dynasty of Babylon, and if he was known to his enemies as ‘king of Ur’ it may be that he hoped, by reviving memories of Ur-Nammu, Dungi, and Bur-Sin, to pose as something more than an alien ruler But the long period of internecine warfare had weakened and impoverished the south, and in the meanwhile there had arisen in Babylon a leader of very diffe
rent calibre from the kings his predecessors Hammurabi came to the throne immediately after Rim-Sm’s victory over Ism, an ally which the
Babyloman forces under his father had failed to
protect Babylon had suffered materially and m
prestige, and the new king’s first concern was to
restore order at home; six years later he wrested Ism and Erech from the hands of Larsa, nulhfying
the results of Rim-Sm’s victory and re-establishmg
the credit of his own city* For twenty-five years



Ism and Larsa i8i
he rested on his laurels, then, when Rim-Sin was a very old man (he had been on the throne for sixty-one years) , he launched a fresh attack on him, defeated the armies of Elam, captured Larsa, and made himself undisputed master of Sumer. In the temple of Nm-gal at Ur the king of Babylon
set up a diorite stela recording his exploits; there
is no mention of any assault upon the city, in the rums no evidence of destruction, the fortune of
war had exchanged one foreign ruler for another, and Ur had accepted the change apparently with
indifference There was to be one more flicker of independence, though whether this was due to Sumenan feeling as such cannot be said A quarter of a century later, in the eleventh year of Samsu-iluna,
Hammurabi’s son, the south rose in revolt Within a twelvemonth it was crushed The twelfth year of Samsu-iluna was described as that in which ‘he razed the walls of Ur’, excavation has shown that in this very year the temples of Ur were plundered and burnt and whole quarters of the town devastated, Babylon punished rebelhon with a heavy hand Other cities of Sumer shared the same fate,
and so far as history goes that was the end Of the Sumerians nothing more is heard Their language, though fallen out of popular use, might
long survive in rehgious texts to be studied by the



1 82 The Sumerians
cunous and painfully understood by the aid of a
dictionary, but the race had gone, exhausted by wars, sapped by decay, swamped by the more
vigorous stock which had eaten of the tree of their knowledge



VII
THE CLAIM OF SUMER
T
hree generations ago the existence of the Sumerians was unknown to the scientific world, to-day their history can be written and
their art illustrated more fully than that of many
ancient peoples It is the history and the art of a race which died out nearly four thousand years ago, whose very name had been forgotten before the beginmng of our era, and it might well be asked whether the knowledge recently acquired IS not merely a matter of curiosity, whether the
Sumerians at all deserve this literary resurrection
It IS true that a novel discovery is liable to upset our perspective and an individual or a nation may from an accident of discovery or from the intnnsic excellence of their products assume an importance altogether out of proportion to the role they have
filled in history the records of man’s activities, the works of his hands, are never without interest,
but those activities may end in a blind alley, the works be isolated examples of art doing no more than illustrate how the human mind reacts to
certain stimuli, the real cntenon of value is, how far have these people coutnbuted to human progress^ what part had they in forming that culture



184 The Sumerians
which IS the heritage of the living world ^ and it is
by this standard that we must estimate the im
portance of the civilization now rescued from
oblivion The earliest cemetery found at Ur, with its royal graves and wonderfully nch furmture, has
been assigned to a date of, in round figures, 3500 B c The date is admittedly vague, based on the
lowest estimate for that of the First Dynasty of Ur, 3100 B G , and allowmg for a reasonable lapse
of time during which the existence of these royal
graves, sanctified as they were by the wholesale
slaughter of human victims and by the deification
of their occupants, could be forgotten and their site
violated by the intrusion of fresh interments. To
this theoretical argument has to be added that
of succession in the graves themselves and the
development of fashions in their structure and
contents, and even if it be supposed that the graves form a continuous senes coming down to the beginmng of the First Dynasty, the earhest of them
must none the less be more ancient by wellnigh four hundred years.
Now this means that the earliest graves of Ur are somewhat older than the First Dynasty of Egypt Egyptian chronology has been a subject
of much dispute and very different conclusions have been reached for the date of the umfication



The Clam of Sumer 185
of the two prehistonc longdoms under Menes, the most conservative view, which also is that held by the majonty of scholars, would put this about 3300 B c , but whether this be accepted or not, the fact remains that the chronologies of Egypt
and of Mesopotamia are so far interdependent that
if Menes be placed further back m time the same thing must be done for Sumenan history and the relation between the two countnes must be left unaltered here the shorter chronology is adopted
for both countnes, but the positive date is for the purposes of the argument of httle importance and
the essential point is the relation between the two whereby the graves of Ur are as old as or older than Menes. Three things have to be compared: the contents of the Ur graves, the contents of the royal graves
of the First Egyptian Dynasty discovered by Professor Fhnders Petne at Abydos, and the character
of the predynastic civilization of the Nile Valley
The prehistonc civilization of Egypt and that of Sumer have nothmg in common Between the prehistonc art of Egypt and that of its First Dynasty
there is a very great difference, not so complete as to amount to a breach of contmmty but enough to mark an epoch, the changes are commg in towards the end of the predynastic penod and by the time
of ‘Menes’ we have what is virtually a new culture.



1 86 The Sumerians
It has long been recognized that this rapid development, which laid the foundations of what we know as Egyptian cmhzation, was due to some foreign influence, and it has long been remarked
that the developed civilization presents in its early
stages certain features common to the Euphrates
valley, for instance, cyhnder seals, pear-shaped
mace-heads of stone, a panelled construction in building, features which appear suddenly with no apparent antecedents and subsequently disappear altogether, whereas in Mesopotamia they would
seem to be native and persist m history To these common features we can now add more, the use
of the sistrum, a musical instrument too peculiar
to have originated independently in two places,
certain types of stone vases, grotesque ammal drawings, and over and above such material
resemblances there are elements m the religion of Egypt which would seem to be denved from Sumerian mythology Even if the character of the borrowings left any doubt as to which country was indebted to the other, which indeed they do
not, the argument of priority m date would be decisive The Egyptians traced back the beginnings of their history to Menes, before whom came
darkness and the demi-gods, and the discoveries
of archaeology have justified their behef, for the Sumenans the First Dynasty of Ur came at the



The Claim of Sumer 187
end of a period of civilization whose duration was to be reckoned in thousands of years, and though recent excavations have carried us back but a
little way into that legendary period, yet they do
substantiate in principle the Sumenan contention.
Nobody looking at the contents of the graves, themselves older than Menes, can fail to see that
they belong to a civilization already old if not actually decadent Nothing is in an experimental
stage, on the contrary, art is subject to conventions
so stereotyped that it is hard to distinguish between objects which are demonstrably hundreds
of years apart in age, there is a technique, es
pecially in metallurgy, which could only result
from centuries of apprenticeship—the Egyptians never in their best periods produced weapons as
good as the socketed axes and adzes of early
Sumer,—and the potter’s wheel, introduced into Egypt well on in the Old Kingdom, had been used by the Sumerians for long ages In the time of ‘Menes’ not only was the cultural level of Mesopotamia far higher than that of Egypt, but whereas
the civilization of Egypt was a novelty, that of
Sumer was ancient, Sumenan civilization, whatever its ultimate ongm, had developed in its own country and on its own Imes for so long that it could fairly by now be called endemic, while that of Egypt was inspired and made possible by the



1 88 The Sumerians
introduction of foreign models and foreign blood. The character of the borrowings and the proximity
of the supenor culture leave no alternative source
for the influence which affected Egypt at the close
of Its predynastic age, directly or indirectly that came from southern Mesopotamia
In the course of this history emphasis has been laid upon the fact that Sumenan arms and Sumenan commerce not only spread up the valleys of the Tigns and Euphrates but obtained a firm
foothold m Syna and penetrated into Asia beyond the Taurus, so that from the very outset there was imposed upon these more backward countnes at
least a veneer of Sumenan civihzation Had that civilization died with the race which onginated
It the early conquests imght have had but an ephemeral effect, but such was not the case In
Mesopotamia the pohtical extinction of the Sumenans made astomshmgly httle difference to culture The old laws of Sumer became with very shght modifications the code of Babylon: rehgion
was imaffected, and though the gods preferred to be called by Semitic names, they were the old Sumenan gods and no Semitic deity could obtain official recognition the Sumenan language fell
mto disuse, but its hterature was translated for the
benefit of the Semitic reader the arts mamtamed
their old traditions so well that even the wall



The Claim of Sumer 189
sculptures of eighth-century Assyria, individual as they appear, betray their parentage with works of the Third Dynasty of Ur and of the fourth millennium b.g The whole civilization of Baby
lon, and in a scarcely less degree that of Assyria,
are rooted in the alien past, as their own historians
of the decadence confessed
Berossus, writing in the fourth or third century before Ghnst, descnbes a race of monsters half man and half fish which, led by one Oannes, came out of the Persian Gulf and settling in the coast towns of Sumer introduced the arts of writing,
agriculture, and working in metal, ^in a word,’ he
declares, ‘all the things that make for the amelioration oflife were bequeathed to men by Oannes, and since that time no further mventions have been made ’
Sumerian genius evolved a civilization which
persisted for nearly fifteen hundred years after its authors had vanished, and Babylon and Nineveh did not keep this hentage to themselves, they also were imperial peoples, and their domimon over or their
intercourse with the west fostered in those lands the seed which earher Sumenan conquerors had planted. The Hittites of Asia Minor adopted the cuneiform scnpt which was one of the greatest of the Sumenan inventions; Babyloman became the diplomatic language of the courts of Syna and



I go The Sumenam
even of Egypt; the cylinder seals of Syria and Cappadocia are both in form and in style denved from Mesopotamia, the sculptures of Carchemish
trace their descent through Assyna to Sumer, the
eclectic art of the Phoenicians m so far as it drew from Onental models was in the same indirect way an offshoot of the Sumenan, This is not to
say that these countnes were slavish copyists of a civihzation which had as a matter of fact passed
clean out of their ken; in each of them the arts developed in a normal way and received a more
or less distinctive stamp of their nationality. But on each of them the Sumenan tradition has had
a profound influence, stronger, naturally, m the
home lands of the lower river valleys where it is
indeed the direct begetter of all that is to follow,
more subtle in the outlying provinces where it is a
collateral rather than a source, and through these
later peoples of the Near East it has influenced the matenal civilization of the modem world Such a claim is not easy to establish by concrete example, partly because we can seldom, if ever,
know all the links in so long a chain, partly be
cause the arts are not static and the inspiration
which originates also modifies and transmutes so that Its first and its final mamfestation may seem to have nothing at all in common. But an instance of plain indebtedness may illustrate a wider truth.



The Claim of Sumer 191
The arch in building was unknown in Europe until the conquests of Alexander, when Greek
architects fastened eagerly on this, to them, novel
feature and they, and later the Romans, introduced to the western world what was to be the
distinguishing element in architecture Now the arch was a commonplace of Babylonian construc
tion—Nebuchadnezzar employed it freely m the Babylon which he rebuilt in 600 b c , at Ur there is still standing an arch in a temple of Kuri-Galzu, king of Babylon about 1400 b c , in private houses of the Sumenan citizens of Ur in 2000 b c the doorways were arched with bncks set in true
voussoir fashion, an arched drain at Nippur must
date to about 3000 b g , true arches roofing the royal tombs at Ur now carry back the knowledge of the principle another four or five hundred years
Here is a clear line of descent to the modern world from the dawn of Sumenan history What is true of the arch is true also of the dome and the vault Here, where the principle once invented is fixed for all time and only minor changes in form can be
introduced, the sequence is easier to follow than in the more fluid arts of design the influence of
Sumer on the plastic art of later peoples is perhaps just as real, but it can be apprehended rather than demonstrated But it is in the more abstract realm of ideas that the Sumerians have most



192 The Sumerians
obviously and most directly contributed to the development of western civilization, through the Hebrew people Not only did the Semites adopt ready-made those stones of the Creation and the Flood which viewed as history or as parable have affected the Chnstian even more than the Jewish
Church, the Jewish religion, as it owed not a little of its ongin to the Sumenan, so also was throughout the period of the Kangs and the Captivity brought into close contact with the Babylonian worship which was taken over from Sumer, and
partly by its precept and partly m opposition to it attained to higher growth. The laws of Moses were largely based on Sumenan codes, those same codes which lay at the bottom of the great Code of Hammurabi, and so from the Sumenans the Hebrews derived the ideals of social hfe and
justice which informed all their history and have
by Christian races been regarded in theory if not
in practice as cntena for their own customs and
enactments The difficulty lies not m recogmzing the fact but in estimating the importance of the debt which the modern world owes to this race so recently rescued from complete oblivion If human effort is to be judged merely by its attainment, then the Sumenans, with due allowance made for date and circumstance, must be accorded a very honourable though not a pre-eminent place

if by Its effect on human history, they merit higher
rank Their civilization, lighting up a world still
plunged in primitive barbansm, was m the nature
of a first cause We have outgrown the phase when all the arts were traced to Greece and Greece was thought to have sprung, like Pallas, full-grown from the brain of the Olympian Zeus, we have learnt how that flower of genius drew its sap from Lydians and Hittites, from Phoenicia and Crete, from Babylon and Egypt But the roots go farther back behind all these hes Sumer The mihtary conquests of the Sumerians, the arts and crafts
which they raised to so high a level, their social orgamzation and their conceptions of morahty, even of rehgion, are not an isolated phenomenon, an archaeological cunosity, it is as part of our own substance that they claim our study, and in so far as they win our admiration we praise our spiritual forebears
