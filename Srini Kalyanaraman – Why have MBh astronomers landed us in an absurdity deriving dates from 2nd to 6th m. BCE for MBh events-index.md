Why have MBh astronomers landed us in an absurdity
deriving dates from 2nd to 6th m. BCE for MBh
events?
This question has to be answered.
Searching for the reasons why we are in such a mess, I find that one contentious issue among astronomers is the resolution of the two eclipse dates on a trayodaśī. This is one reason why the absurd situation has resulted, rendering us as a laughing stock in the academic community that we cannot chronologically narrate Itihāsa of Bhāratam.
MBh astronomers who are in denial of Kali Yuga are doing disservice to Vyāsa tradition. Astronomers who torture Vyāsa's words about, say, eclipse pairs are also doing disservice to Vyāsa tradition and the tradition of intellectual inquiry. Why torture the text rendered in such an expressive, precise language of Samskrtam with absurd jyotiṣa interpretations and misreading of the text?
caturdaśīṁ pañcadaśīṁ bhūtapūrvāṁ ca ṣoḍaśīm imāṁ tu nābhijānāmi amāvāsyāṁ trayodaśīm (Bhīṣmaparvan 6.3.28) candrasūryāv ubhau grastāv ekamāse trayodaśīm aparvaṇi grahāv etau prajāḥ saṃkṣapayiṣyataḥ (Bhīṣmaparvan 6.3.29)
Executive summary by Kisari Mohan Ganguly: Three lunations twice meeting together in course of the same lunar fortnight, the duration of the latter is shortened by two days. On the thirteenth day therefore, from the first lunation, according as it is the day of the full moon or the new moon, the moon and the sun are afflicted by Rahu. Such strange eclipses, both lunar and solar, forebode a great slaughter. (Aparvaṇi, i.e., not on Parva days or days of full-moon and new-moon as ordinarily coming. The Bombay edition, after aparvaṇi, reads graheṇau tau. A better reading unquestionably grastavetau, as many Bengal texts have.) https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m06/m06003.htm Thus, KM Ganguly's translation clearly refers to two strange eclipses both lunar and solar. KM Ganguly's comment is vivid: "A better reading unquestionably grastavetau, as many Bengal texts have."
Whether one reads the expression as spell-check variants of grastavetau 'two planets eclipsed' or grahāv etau 'two seized planets', the two precise descriptions of Vyāsa are clear references in BP 6.3.28 and BP 6.3.29 to two eclipses, lunar followed by solar.
I am just baffled why some astronomers claim that such eclipses did not occur and that the verses are an elaboration of a particular tithi, trayodaśī. How clever can one get?
How can anyone accept such a claim which flies against the jyotiṣa, skymap observations? I am only a विद्यार्थी , not a nimittajna, not a jyautiṣiká; I am baffled on how have we landed in such an absurd situation dating MBh events to dates between 2nd to 6th m. BCE? This absurdity has to resolved to restore Bhāratīya Knowledge systems, jnāna paramparā, and declare 'Nay Science' as Vishwa Adluri ji and Joydeep Bagchee ji have done so brilliantly exposing the shenanigans of some German indologists.



In my view, Krishen Kaul nails the jyotiṣa pramāṇa brilliantly. MBh daters waxing eloquent about the MBh events before 3102 Kaliyuga start date should rethink their opinions and erroneous conclusions. MBh events occurred AFTER the onset of Kaliyuga as repeatedly mentioned by Vyasa in MBh text. I have shown the importance of 3102 BCE date when kiśora Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, 11 year youth restores dharma, killing Kamsa, thus explaining the raison d'etre of the avatāra. Conclusive proof of the avatāra puruṣa, Gitācārya. I cannot understand why some MBh astronomers link Kaliyuga date to end of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa avatāra.
Two consecutive eclipses within 13 tithis or within less than 14 days serquence, are reported by Vyasa. This shows that 3139 BCE cannot be the date of the MBh war; only 3067 BCE can be. Here is a link to an excellent article by Krishen Kaul.
