Three hieroglyph motifs can be readily identified to demonstrate the continuity of representation of the motifs on seals from Meluhha to Ancient Near East. The three motifs are the following which are explained as rebus readings of Meluhha glosses:1. Overflowing water from a vase Hieroglyphs: lo 'pot overflow' kāṇṭam 'water' Rebus: lo 'copper' khāṇḍā 'tools, weapons'2. Six hair-curls Hieroglyphs: āra ‘six’, ‘rings of hair’ Rebus: āra 'brass'. 3. One-eyed person Hieroglyphs: kāṇa 'one-eyed' Rebus: kaṇṇahāra -- m. ʻhelmsman, sailor’. kannār 'coppersmiths'.Meluhha settlements in Mesopotamia of the Bronze Age are attested in cuneiform texts. There is a possibility that some of the hieroglyphs deployed on cylinder seals of Mesopotamia were based on Meluhha cipher: that is, Meluhha hieroglyphs rendering rebus as Meluhha glosses to denote stone-/metalartefacts.A number of cylinder seals are presented from Ward, William Hayes,1910, The cylinder seals of western Asia, Carnegie Institute of Washington, Publication No. 100 Рипол Классик wich has 1315 illustrations.

One-Eyed Hero with Lions Flanked by Enclosures Iran (?) (ca. 3100 B.C.E) 50 x 40 mm Seal No. 4 "Seal 4 presents as its central figure a cyclopic hero holding lions. The rest of the scene includes animals, pots, and other types of containers, as well as a human figure and two lion-headed eagles, all apparently meant to be within an inclosure indicated by two stockade-like frames. A related theme is found in a fragment of a vase from Khafajah.... The nude bearded hero seen in 4 remained a stock figure of the Mesopotamian repertory, aapearing for the most part in contst scenes. The cyclopic version of this figure in 4 is paralleled in only one other instance, an Early Dynastic seal impression from Fara (ancient Shuruppak). A plaque from Khafajah of some thousand years later shows a cyclopic demon whose head has the form of a sun. Because of the wide gap in time, however, there is no assurance that the hero in 4 is to be associated in any manner with this figure."--Porada, CANES, p. 3Center: nude one-eyed hero holding two reversed lions, two more lions forming pyramid above him -- Left: section of inclosure containing sheep, latter between two pots, with lion-headed eagle perched on head of sheep; basket, pouch(?), fish, and bird in upper field -- Right: sheep-headed demon grasping pole of second section of inclosure; within latter, human figure(?) with upturned curls holding in outstretched hands indefinable curved object marked by vertical incisions; lion-headed eagle above horns of sheep-demon; crib(?) in upper field.

Cylinder Seal of Ibni-Sharrum Agade period, reign of Sharkali-Sharri (c. 2217-2193 BCE)Mesopotamia Serpentine H. 3.9 cm; Diam. 2.6 cm Formerly in the De Clercq collection; gift of H. de Boisgelin, 1967 AO 22303 "A scene testifying to relations with distant lands Buffaloes are emblematic animals in glyptic art in the Agade period. They first appear in the reign of Sargon, indicating sustained relations between the Akkadian Empire and the distant country of Meluhha, that is, the present Indus Valley, where these animals come from. These exotic creatures were probably kept in zoos and do not seem to have been acclimatized in Iraq at the end of the 3rd millennium BC. Indeed, it was not until the Sassanid Empire that they reappeared. The engraver has carefully accentuated the animals' powerful muscles and spectacular horns, which are shown as if seen from above, as they appear on the seals of the Indus."

Goddess Pleading Before Enki c.2330-2150 B.C.E Akkad period. Marble. Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia A supplicating goddess of lower rank, indicated by her single-horned miter, approaches the enthroned Enki flanked by his two-faced minister Isimud and his acolyte, the nude hero. With her arm uplifted and her hand held before her mouth, she appears as a supplicant to Enki.
Attacking Demons c.2000-1600 B.C.E Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period. Hematite. Cylinder seal. Ischali, in the Diyala region, Mesopotamia. A kneeling figure with upraised arm is attacked by demonic creatures with leonine heads and bird feet, and by a male figure with multiple mace and scimitar. The exact nature of the demonic figures is difficult to determine, but the association of birdlike beings with the nether world is common in the Near East and the Aegean. The galla are described as those "who flutter over heaven and earth" in "Dumuzi1s Dream", suggesting their birdlike nature. And as Henri Frankfort has shown, soul-birds in Egypt and harpies and sirens in the Aegean area all objectified certain aspects of terror inspired by

death. The frightening, bird-clawed monsters with gaping mouths may represent similar underworld beings threatening the small cringing man with
death. Goddess from the Other World 2000-1600 B.C.E Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period. Hematite. Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia An enormous winged bird-footed goddess stands frontally with hands clasped. A double register scene appears alongside her. In the upper register a nude goddess and a bearded deity receive homage from human worshippers. A row of composite beings appear in the lower register. A fly, a hedgehog(?), and a human head appear above these creatures in the field. This goddess with bird features has been identified with Lilith. She may represent the chthonic aspect of Inanna/Ishtar derived from her association with the demonic and frequently bird-like creatures and gods that inhabit the underworld. Here, the goddess1s horned head appears alongside deities and their human worshippers while her bird-feet appear beside demonic creatures. The hierarchical arrangement of this scene may signify her dual nature, partially of "heaven and earth" and partially of the underworld.
Inanna on Her Throne c.2000-1600 B.C.E Akkad period.Nephrite. Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia During the period of Akkadian control of Mesopotamia (c.2334-2154 B.C.), the early Sumerian "Lady of Heaven" and fertility goddess Inanna merged with the Semitic Ishtar, a warrior goddess. The goddess Inanna/Ishtar appears on this Akkadian seal, seated on a throne decorated with two crossed lions. Weapons, including a scimitar and a mace, rise from her shoulders as she gestures to two worshippers and looks full-face at the viewer. Her flounced garment covers only one shoulder, and her long hair falls in curls down to her elbows. To the left of Inanna/Ishtar stands an attendant goddess wearing a single-horned miter. To her right a female figure gestures in worship and pours a libation into a vessel.

Goddess in Underworld c.2330-2150 B.C.E Akkad period. Hematite. Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia Flanked by two forms shaped like mountains, perhaps symbolic of the kur (the underworld), stands a frontal-facing goddess. Undulating rays or flames rise from her shoulders and may indicate either her solar or infernal nature. A ring -- possibly similar to the ring that was taken from Inanna when she entered the fifth gate of the underworld -- is held in her hand. To the right, within one mountain, a deity with rays or flames rising from his shoulders grasps the tail of a bull-man. To the left, a deity with a scourge stands grasping the horn of another deity who collapses within another flaming mountain. A small figure kneels beside the mountain to the left.
Scorpions and Rosette c.3300 B.C.E Gawra period. Steatite. Stamp seal. North Mesopotamia Inanna1s symbol, the eight-pointed star or rosette, appears between the pincers of two scorpions on the square face of this stamp seal.

Rosette Flowers to Sheep c.3200-3000 B.C.E Late Uruk-Jemdet Nasr period. Marble. Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia
A bearded male figure wears a round cap and a skirt with netlike pattern. This man appears on many artifacts excavated at Inanna1s city, Uruk, and may represent the en, or priestking, of the city, who assumes the role of divine consort of Inanna in the sacred marriage ceremony. Clasped to his chest are two curving branches ending in rosette-flowers. These rosette symbols of Inanna are nibbled by maned sheep, literally portraying the nourishment of the flocks ensured by the union of the goddess and her consort. The emblems of Inanna that flank the scene suggest that it is taking place within the sacred precinct of her temple. http://wings.buffalo.edu/english/faculty/christian/syllabi/375/hhjw1/hhjw1.htm
Foundation Figure of a Kneeling God Holding a Peg
Mesopotamia, period of Gudea (ca. 2144–2124 b.c.); copper Height: ca. 19.5 cm Purchase: AZ 145
"This well-preserved copper figurine is a god, identifiable as such by his headgear, topped by several pairs of bull's horns. He is symbolically "nailing" the foundation of the temple permanently to the earth. The sculptor vested a figure, fully realized in the round, with an inherent naturalism and delicate fluidity. Though immobilized by the act depicted, the muscular interaction of his body parts is well understood. By analogy with earlier inscribed foundation figures, the deity probably represents the personal god of Gudea, ruler of Lagash." Copper Foundation Figure with a Kneeling God Holding a Peg [sculpture]. God (probably the personal god of Gudea) wearing short kilt and long split skirt in semi-kneeling posture, supporting between its legs a large peg. Gudea was the leader of Lagash around 2150 B.C.
Traces of fabric remain in the corrosion in the area around the beard on the god’s head. Foundation figures were often wrapped in cloth prior to burial. Inscription names "Gudea" and "Lagash", but because of the corrosion, it is impossible to read the remainder, which would have named the god and the templehttp://www.themorgan.org/collections/collectionsPaging.asp?page=92&id=Seals

Hero Grasping Lion Griffin; Monkey Perched on Tree Flanked by Ibex and Bird of Prey Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Middle Assyrian period (ca.thirteenth century B.C.E) Chert 15 mm diameter Seal no. 596 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 571 Lion-griffin in grasp of bearded hero brandishing ax -- Terminal: tree with volute below branches; monkey perched at top, eating fruit; ibex at left, bird of prey at right. "Palm trees marked with volutes are found in 596 and 597. This use of volutes recalls Mitannian designs, though in the latter the tree as a whole always conveys an impression of artificiality, whereas on the Middle Assyrian seals it has the appearance of a natural tree merely ornamented with metal bands." Porada, CANES, p. 69
Bearded Hero with Daggers Between Two Ibexes Facing Tree Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Middle Assyrian period (ca. thirteenth century B.C.E) Jasper 29 x 12 mm Seal no. 597 Bearded hero (full face), dagger in each hand, standing between two ibexes that jump away from him, each toward tree that is flanked by them as scene repeats. "Palm trees marked with volutes are found in 596 and 597. This use of volutes recalls Mitannian designs, though in the latter the tree as a whole always conveys an impression of artificiality, whereas on the Middle Assyrian seals it has the appearance of a natural tree merely ornamented with metal bands."

"Scenes showing worshipers standing before a deity without an intermediary (245247) are rare in this period and later." Porada, CANES, p. 30

Suppliant Goddess with Scorpions Before Winged Goddess with Weapons in Chamber Formed by Guilloches Cylinder seal and impression Syria (ca. 1720–1650 B.C.E) Hematite 21.5 x 11 mm Seal no. 960 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 957 Two facing suppliant goddesses, between them, star disk in crescent, three scorpions, one above other -- Winged goddess with spear and scimitar in chamber formed by guilloches "A number of cylinders (958-960) picture a winged goddess holding a spear or some other weapon that indicates her martial character. That the figure represents a goddess and not a god is indicated by the headgear, a square horned miter seen only on female deities ... In 959 the goddess appears to be supervising a contest between two gods, one of whom is identified by the crescent on his helmet as associated with the moon. Seal 960 shows her in a chamber formed by guilloches, while outside of this inclosure suppliant goddess are worshiping scorpions, perhaps her symbol. ... The portrayeal of the suppliant goddesses in 960 does not deviate greatly from Old Babylonian examples; this may support a dating of the seal near the time of the First Dynasty of Babylon." . Porada, CANES, p. 128
Male Figure Before a Goddess Drawing Aside Her Mantle Cylinder seal and impression Syria (ca. 1720–1650 B.C.E) Hematite 23 x 11 mm Seal no. 945 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 924 Male figure before goddess drawing aside her mantle, bird perched on her finger -Secondary motif: two sitting lions, facing, above guilloche -- Below it, ibex pawed by griffin."In 945 and 946, the nude female is partly clothed, but the mantle falling over one leg, far from covering her nudity, serves only to accentuate it. This is especially true in 945, where she is shown holding the mantle to one side. The male personage facing her in 946 is clad much like the worshiper in 910. in what has been judged to be royal attire (in 945 only his cap is like that in 910). The fact that the nude female usually appears with a mantle in scenes in which she is associated with such a personage, for example in Louvre A.934, may indicate that this rendering illustrates her specific aspect in relation to that figure, presumably a king."--Porada, CANES, p. 124-125

God with Lightining Fork and Foot on Bull Facing Male Figure; Nude Femaile Above Antelope Head; Male Figure Approaching Enthroned Figure Cylinder seal and impression Northern Mesopotamia, Mitannian period (ca. 1600–1350 B.C.E.) Hematite 27 x 13 mm Seal no. 1020 God with lightning fork placing foot on bull and facing mace-bearing figure in ascending posture -- Small nude female beside vessel above antelope head -- Figure with scimitar facing enthroned figure, between them sun disk, lion, and ball staff -- Stand(?) composed of five globes behind head of enthroned figure -- Six scattered globes in field. "Seals 1020 and 1021 still recall Old Babylonian designs in the general arrangement of their principal figures and in the ascending posture of the gods with emblems. However, the Mitannian elements in these seals are more pronounced; they are manifested by the small designs in the field, and in 1021 by the secondary motif and by the standard held by the god."--Porada, CANES, p. 141
Female Worshiper Facing God Enthroned on Two Human-Headed Bulls Cylinder seal and impression Southern Mesopotamia, Kassite period (ca. 1430–1155 B.C.E) Jasper 32.5 x 16 mm Seal no. 575 Ward, Morgan, no. 125 Female worshiper facing god who holds vase(?) and is seated on throne supported by two kneeling human-headed bulls -- Terminal: Inscription, one line carried into field."Seals 568-585 represent the earlier stage. Most of the designs of this group show elongated figures and extensive inscriptions containing prayers. This style seems to have evolved at about the beginning of the Kassite period. The phase of transition from Old Babylonian designs to Kassite cylinders of this type is clearly marked by pieces like 568 and 569. The style is therefore referred to as Early Kassite, despite the fact that it appears to have survived into the later centuries of Kassite rule. This is indicated by the names of the Kassite kings found in some of the inscriptions..."--Porada, CANES, p. 63

Hero Grasping Lions Standing on Kneeling Bulls, Winged Sun Disk Above: Birds of Prey Perched in Palmette Tree Flanked by Sphinx and Griffin Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Middle Assyrian period (ca. fourteenth century B.C.E) Rock crystal 27 x 13 mm Seal no. 592 Ward, Morgan, no. 165 Center: hero grasping lion at either side, each lion on back of kneeling bull; above each lion, bird of prey; below first lion, kneeling antelope; over whole group, winged sun disk -- Terminal: bird of prey between female sphinx and griffin, each monster resting hind foot on one lion of main motif, other hind foot on small antelope, while forefeet of both monsters rest on crown of palmette tree."A fourteenth-century dating is indicated for 592 by the fact that the design retains many Mitannian features. There is still a considerable use of the drill, the composition takes in the entire height of the seal, and certain figures--the kneeling bulls, the sphinx, and the griffin--are taken over almost unchanged from Mitannian seal designs." Porada, CANES, p. 68
Lion Griffins Attacking Bull; Palmette Tree Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Middle Assyrian period (ca. fourteenth century B.C.E) Chert 24 x 11.5 mm Seal no. 594 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 698 Two lion-griffins attacking bull between them -- Terminal: palmette tree. "Dating of 594 in the fourteenth century is indicated by its similarity to a seal impression of that time (Weber 316a). In each instance a decorative motif is formed by using the wings of the lion-griffins to frame a palmette tree. In the scene of the impression the shoulder feathers of the lion-griffin’s wings are indicated by drillings. This distinctive detail (which appears to derive from Mitannian designs), though it is lacking in 594, does appear in 595." Porada, CANES, p. 68
Griffin Demon Grasping Bull Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Middle Assyrian period



18
(ca. fourteenth century B.C.E) Chalcedony 20 x 10 mm Seal no. 595 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 636 Walking bull with its tail grasped by griffin-demon on one knee, whose other hand touches same bull, thus initiating repetition of scene -- In field, inscription. "Dating of 594 in the fourteenth century is indicated by its similarity to a seal impression of that time (Weber 316a). In each instance a decorative motif is formed by using thw ings of the lion-griffins to frame a palmette tree. In the scene of the impression the shoulder feathers of the liongriffin’s wings are indicated by drillins. This distinctive detail (which appears to derive from Mitannian designs), though it is lacking in 594, does appear in 595. Furthermore, the delicate modeling of the latter seal indicates that it belongs to the fourteenth-century group of Middle Assyrian cylinders. It may be noted that in 595 the tip of the second horn of the bull is indicated; thus the bull’s head is shown in a quasi three-quarter view. While such three-quarter profiles remain unparalleled in Mesopotamian designs, they occur frequently in contemporary Aegean art." Porada, CANES, p. 68
Hero Grasping Bull and Mouflon Menaced by a Lion Attacked by a Second Hero Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Early Dynastic II period (ca. 2750–2600 B.C.E) Marble 28 x 24 mm Seal no. 52 "The heros in the contests often, as in 52, wear flat caps as well as skirts tucked up above the knee to provide freedom of movement. The fact that in a contemporaneous limestone inlay from Kish a king is similarly attired shows that such caps and skirts were characteristic of the Second Early Dynastic period." . Porada, CANES, p. 910
Lion-Armed Demon with Human Torso and Legs; Two Scorpions; Small Seated Figure, and Crossed Lions Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Early Dynastic II period (ca. 2750–2600 B.C.E) Marble 37 x 24 mm Seal no. 61 "Equally distinctive of this age is the two-pointed headdress seen in 60 and 61 and rendered on a larger scale in an alabaster plaque from Fara... In 61 the composite monster with two-pointed headdress is comparable to the composite figures in the contest friezes of the Second Early Dynastic period, as found in 59. Though the meaning of this monster, as well as that of the rest of the scene, is enigmatic, the arrangement of the figures and their strange actions suggest that the scene may be connected with some mythological concept." Porada, CANES, p. 10-11

Horned Deity (?) Seated Before a Shrine, with a Nude Hero Attacking a Lion; Entwined LionHeaded Snakes Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Early Dynastic II period (ca. 2750–2600 B.C.E) Lapis lazuli 25 x 12 mm Seal no. 62 "The theme of 62, in which a hero and a lion--both figures of the contest frieze--take part in the main scene, has been interpreted by Frankfort as representing the god of fertility seated before his temple. The classification of this seal is not quite certain, because the engraving shows an application of the drill that is unusually pronounced for this period." Porada, CANES, p. 11
Seated Figures Drinking Through Tubes; Eagle Between Small Animals, with a Boar and Scorpion Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Early Dynastic III period (ca. 26002334 B.C.) Marble 38.5 x 24 mm Seal no. 112 "Seals 105 and 106... and perhaps also 107 and 112, belong to the Second Early Dynastic period... In the lower register of 112, the monster whose tail ends in a scorpion recalls the composite monsters of the Second Early Dynastic period; a dating in this period is also indicated by the linear execution of the design."

Heroes Protecting Animals From Felines Cylinder seal Mesopotamia, Early Dynastic III period (ca.2600–2334B.C.E) Lapis lazuli 24 x 13 mm Seal no. 80 Nude hero with dagger and curved weapon attacking leopard that menaces stag -- Latter clasped by hero with upturned curls who also clasps mouflon assailed by lion -- In field: inscription. "Seals 80-84 probably originated in the same time [as Seal 78], since the small figures on these seals are in the same style as those on the impression of the seal of Barnamtarra, Lugalanda’s wife."

Frequently a symetrical effect is obtained by a duplication of the humanheaded bull (147-52, 154). These scenes... show the lack of cohesion in composition that is characteristic of Early Akkad seals. Equally characteristic is the more developed modeling of the figures. Lastly, a number of details serve to distinguish this class of seals: the attitudes of the heroes and of the bull-men, who often show a characteristic flexion of the elbow in reaching toward the top of the victim’s head; the lion’s head frequently seen from above, as in the representations of the Third Early Dynastic period; the attire of the heroes, most often plain or fringed kilts, with flat caps or feather crowns appearing in several instances."-Porada, CANES, p. 21

A Lion-Headed Eagle Grasping Two Mountain Goats, inscribed Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Post-Akkadian period (ca. 2154–2100 B.C.E) Steatite 30 x 17 mm Seal no. 267 Ward, Morgan, no. 13 Lion-headed eagle clutching hindquarters of two ibexes -- Terminal: inscription. "Seals 264-266, each of which presents a frieze with an eagle in the center, are characterized as Post-Akkad stones by their deeply incised engraving. Moreover, the eagle in 264 and 265 corresponds with a similar figure in Berlin 247, a seal showing in its lower register the birds found to be distinctive of Post-Akkad cylinders (258, 260). Of this group, 267 is the only seal that shows a continuation of Akkad style. It is included here because of its Sumerian inscription, which is typically Post-Akkad. The subject of the seal, a lion-headed eagle clutching animals, is an Early Dynastic theme found especially on the monuments of Lagash, where it still persisted in Post-Akkad times. For example, the theme is treated in a manner similar to that of this seal, but with lions replacing the ibexes, on a stele of Gudea, a ruler of Lagash in the latter part of the PostAkkad period. It seems possible, therefore, that 267 was made at Lagash in or about the time of Gudea." Porada, CANES, p. 32
Worshiper Led by Goddess Toward Enthroned God, inscribed Cylinder seal and impression Mesopotamia, Third Dynasty of Ur (ca. 2112–2004 B.C.E) Jasper 32 x 20 mm Seal no. 277 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 308
The religious sentiment of the period is profoundly visualized on this seal. The enthroned deity on the right receives a worshiper led by an interceding goddess. The deity is characterized by his erect posture, long flowing beard, and the steady gaze of his eye fully sculpted in profile. The scene is remarkable for the interaction of the figures expressed by their gestures, specifically through their delicately carved hands. Commerce was crucial to the success of the Third Dynasty of Ur; the inscription on the seal identifies its owner as a trader. "The type of scene most frequently found on cylinders of the Third Dynasty of Ur



30
shows a minor goddess leading a worshiper by the hand toward an enthroned deity (277287), who is more often female than male. Usually the throne resembles a shrine. This scheme is derived from such Akkad seals as 190, with the difference that now the enthroned deities are rarely identified by the objects they hold or by other distinctive features of their appearance. A crescent is usually placed in the sky before the enthroned deity; often a bird or some other animal appears near the knees of the figure."--Porada, CANES, p. 35
Suppliant goddess and worshiper before god with rod and ring on temple throne, his feet on kneeling bull -- Goddess (full face) -- God holding vase with three leaves protruding -- In field, nude male figure; bull (in sky); star disk in crescent above goat sitting on platform behind throne; nude female. Cylinder seal Mesopotamia, First Dynasty of Babylon (ca.1894–1595b B.C.E) Hematite 23.5 x 12.5 mm Seal no. 391 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 327 "In 387 and 388, the god stepping on the dragon rests his hand on a scimitar. In 389 and 390 he is enthroned with his feet on the back of the dragon and appears to hold a rod. Such a rod, together with a ring, appears in the hands of a number of apparently different gods on Babylonian seals. For example, the two objects are held by the enthroned god in 391. This deity may be the sun god, since the latter appears without his saw but with a rod and ring in the relief on the stele bearing Hammurabi’s code. This suggestion is possibly confirmed by the appearance in 391 of a bull in the sky and of another under the feet of the deity, since this animal is frequently depicted in association with the sun god on Old Babylonian seals... The double pleats in the robes of the deities resemble corresponding details in impressions on tablets of the time of Hammurabi and of Samsu-iluna, his successor (Louvre A. 527 J, E; Louvre A. 553 A, E). A similar dating is therefore suggested for 391.". Porada, CANES, p. 48-49

"There may be some significant relation between the sun god and the goddess standing with clasped hands at the left in 399... The double pleats in the robes of the deities on this seal and on 401 are similar to those seen in 391 above, for which a dating in the time of Hammurabi and Samsu-iluna has been suggested."

"... while the arrangement of the Old Babylonian contests is similar to that used in the earlier period, the introduction of new figures, especially in 359

"Seals 910-913 show worshipers before a seated deity; ... The shape of the throne, which in 910-913 resembles that of a temple, is characteristic of scenes of the Third Dynasty of Ur and of early Old Babylonian designs ... Since 910 has been referred to the time of Hammurabi, 911-913, which present related subjects, may be similarly dated, though the deities are rendered not with horned miter as in 910 but with the more typically Syrian short curled hair. The worshiping scenes of 910-913 can be differentiated from their Mesopotamian parallels by the egyptianizing character of the objects held by the enthroned deities ... Of the small symbolic designs that appear in the field in Old Babylonian seals, only the ball staff and vessel recur with any frequency in these Syrian seals."--Porada, CANES, p. 118-119

"Indubitable renderings of the weather god are found in 967 and 968. In both these seals he is standing on mountains an dbrandishing a mace in one hand. In 967 he is shown holding a snake and a bull’s rein in the other hand, like the god in 964, though here the snake is clearly depicted, while the third object in the same hand is a lotus blossom, not an ax. This blossom invites comparison with a relief from Ras Shamra in which the weather god holds a spear topped with a plant element, probably a transformed lightning symbol. ... In 967 he faces a nude goddess standing on a bull, like the female deity in 942 and 943. This representation, and a similar one in Brett 90, where, however, the nude goddess appears in a winged inclosure, suggest a connection between these two figures like that predicated in regard to the nude female and the weather god in Old Babylonian seals. ... 966 and 97 show the fastidious engraving that marks the height of Syrian glyptic."--Porada, CANES, p. 129
Nude Goddess with Open Veil and Worshiper Holding Hare Before Enthroned Male Figure, Vultures Above Cylinder seal and impression Syria (ca. 1720–1650 B.C.E) Hematite 21 x 10 mm Seal no. 937 Ward, Seal cylinders, no. 917 Nude goddess with opened veil -- Worshiper holding hare behind leg before enthroned deity(?) with cup -- In sky, star, sun disk in crescent -- Fish in field -- Terminal: sitting antelope above two small female figures -Upper border, three vultures with spread wings."The figure of a woman lifting the ends of her veil and displaying her nudity, as found in 937-944, is differentiated from the earlier Syrian and Cappadocian representations of a nude female by a more rounded form and a more elaborate coiffure. The hair is bound up in the back, but otherwise it resembles the ornate coiffure of the goddess in an ivory relief from Ras Shamra that reflects the feminine fashion prevailing in the Levant and in the Aegean regions around the middle of the second millennium. A dating at about this time is likewise suggested by the vase held by the enthroned figure in 937, since it corresponds in shape with a Mycenean gold cup dated in the second half of the sixteenth centuy B.C. ... Sometimes she stands before an enthroned male figure who my, by the mere fact that he is seated, be characterized as a superior deity
