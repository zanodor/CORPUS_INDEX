# Index for Tom van Bakel – The fire god Agni appears to be the main deity of The Mature Harappa Civilization.pdf

The fire god Agni appears to be the main deity of The Mature Harappa Civilization
From 3240 to 2160 BCE New Year began at the moment the sun appeared in Pleiades. These 1080 years roughly coincided with the Early and Mature Harappa Civilization, which lasted from about 3300 to 1900 BCE. Usually marriages were performed during the New Year Festivals and because Agni was the presiding deity of Pleiades he was the one who gave life during the wedding nights:
'(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis;
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25, Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
And that is one of the reasons why the fire god was so loved in The Mature Harappa Civilization.
When we want to recognize the different deities on the Indus stamps it is important to know that they cannot be known by their mount, because in the Indus Valley Civilization animals were not yet mounted. It turns out that the animals themselves embodied the deities, just as it is described in the Rigveda. For example, in hymn 4-16 it is said to Indra: 'Thou a wild elephant' and on the stamps the storm god is indeed depicted as an elephant.
Unfortunately, then a new problem arises, because in the Rigveda many gods are called ‘a bull’. For example Indra is the Bull of earth etc.:
Rigveda 6-44 Indra 21 Thou art the Bull of earth, the Bull of heaven, Bull of the rivers, Bull of standing waters.
For thee, the Strong, O Bull, hath Indu swollen. juice pleasant, sweet to drink, for thine election.
The sun gods Surya and Vishnu are Bulls:
Rigveda 10-189 Surya.
1. This spotted Bull hath come, and sat before the Mother in the east,
Rigveda 1-154 Vishnu
3 Let the hymn lift itself as strength to Vishnu, the Bull far-striding, dwelling on the mountains,
Soma is a Bull:
Rigveda 9-6 Soma Pavamana
1. Soma, flow on with pleasant stream, a Bull devoted to the Gods,
The deities Rudra, Parjanya, Usas and the Maruts are Bulls too:
Rigveda 2-33 Rudra
15 O tawny Bull, thus showing forth thy nature, as neither to be wroth, O God, nor slay us.
Rigveda 5-83 Parjanya
1. Sing with these songs thy welcome to the Mighty, with adoration praise and call Parjanya. The Bull, loud roaring, swift to send his bounty, lays in the plants the seed. for germination.
Rigveda 3-61 Usas
7 On Law's firm base the speeder of the Mornings, the Bull, hath entered mighty earth and heaven.
Rigveda 7-56 Maruts
21 Never, O Maruts, may we lose your bounty, nor, car-borne Lords! be hitidmost when ye deal it. Give us a share in that delightful treasure, the genuine wealth that, Bulls! is your possession.
It is clear that many deities are embodied by this beautiful quadruped, hence, if we only see this animal then it is impossible to say which god it represents. So we have to find out to which text the seals refer, and who is mentioned in them as an elephant, a bull or a bird.



M-1093
A bull can be linked to Taurus in the first place: from 4320 to 2160 BCE, New Year started when the sun entered this constellation.
A bull is also mentioned in the ‘Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25’. Yet, in Hermann Oldenberg's translation of this Sutra a bull is only mentioned once: in Khanda 22 the following is said: 'A bull is the fee for the sacrifice’.
But in the 'Älteste Indische Dichtung und Prosa' by Klaus Mylius we can read:
‘Diese angenehmen Samentropfen, die die Männer für uns erzeugen, aus diesen gebare du einen Sohn; sei eine gut gebarende Milchkuh! Brülle, bewege dich, lege den Embryo in (sie) empfangen;
einen Stier, o Stier, lege in (sie)!’ Älteste Indische Dichtung und Prosa Klaus Mylius
An this is the English translation:
‘These agreeable drops of semen that men produce for us, from these you bear a son; be a goodbearing dairy cow! Roar, move, put the embryo in (her) conceive; a bull, o bull, put in (her)!’
So according to Klaus Mylius an embryo is a bull put in the mother. Of course it is called 'a bull' as it is put in her in Taurus.
Hermann Oldenberg did not mention this four-legged animal at all: he translated this phrase as follows:
'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow. 'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, put into her; to generation we call thee.’
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
On the broken stamp you can see that the bull is eating. This demonstrates that in Khanda 24 the father gives food to eat to the child:
Khanda 24
3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon), 4. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the wisdom (‘veda’) raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!'(with these words) he gives him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, consisting of two syllables, or of four syllables, or also of six syllables; he should take a krit (suffix), not a taddhita.
So if we base our analysis on the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra, then we must conclude that the male embryo is embodied by a bull and his father feeds him immediately after his birth.



M-259
After studying pots from the Indus Valley I found out that the zebu bull represents Soma. This drink is mentioned in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25, in the tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse:
Rigveda 1-91 Soma.
7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, And energy that he may live.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
And thus Soma has a role in this Sutra and that is why it is depicted on this stamp as a zebu.
See: (29) Richly decorated Soma jars from the Indus Valley Civilisation | Tom van Bakel - Academia.edu
Fig.16: Narrative seal BNL5683 © NHK 2000
In Khanda 23 a medicine (Soma) is prepared to drive away the Rakshas and on this stamp this is visualized by the zebu defeating five enemies.
Khanda 23
1. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the egg-plant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order
to drive away the Rakshas.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg



M-9 a
I always thought that a ‘unicorn’ bull embodies Kartikeya, but recently I found out that it represents Agni, because several times the fire god was called ‘a Bull’ in the Rigveda:
Rigveda 1-31 Agni
5 Thou, Agni, art a Bull who makes our store increase, to be invoked by him who lifts the ladle up.
The horn of the unicorn looks like the horns of an Indian aurochs:
Drawing based on an aurochs bull skeleton from Lund and a cow skeleton from Cambridge, with characteristic features of the aurochs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs#/media/File:Aurochsfeatures.jpg
The so called ‘unicorn’ may be visualized like this aurochs showing one horn instead of two.
M-35 a
And thus, the bulls are depicted in characteristic ways: a bull that is eating embodies an embryo, a zebu embodies Soma, and a 'unicorn' embodies the fire god Agni.



Agni sitting on a red goat, as medicine Buddha in 15th-century Tibetan Buddhist art.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni
Usually in India today Agni's vehicle is a ram, but in Tibet he is one of the fifty-one Buddhist deities and his vehicle is a goat:
In Tibet, he is one of the fifty-one Buddhist deities found in the mandala of medicine Buddha. He appears in Tibetan Manjushri's mandalas as well, where he is depicted with Brahma and Indra. The Tibetan iconography for Agni strongly resembles that found in the Hindu tradition, with elements such as red-colored skin, a goat vehicle.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni
And some just write that Agni rides on a goat:
Agni rides upon a goat, which symbolically represents impurity, lust and desires.
https://www.hinduwebsite.com/vehicles.asp
Yet, on Indus stamps we can see that the fire god was depicted as a bull, a ram or as a goat.
M-272
And thus this Markhor goat, with its ‘fiery’ horns, represented Agni himself.



As said before, from 3240 to 2160 BCE in India, and in the Indus Valley Culture, New Year began when the sun appeared in the Pleiades. This period roughly coincided with the early and mature Harappa Culture that lasted from about 3300 to 1900 BCE.

A color-composite image of the Pleiades from the Digitized Sky Survey https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades
This is a color-composite image of the Pleiades. With the naked eye we can only distinguish seven stars of this small constellation in Taurus:
The Pleiades (/ˈpliː.ədiːz, ˈpleɪ-, ˈplaɪ-/), also known as The Seven Sisters, Messier 45 and other names by different cultures, is an asterism and an open star cluster containing middle-aged, hot Btype stars in the north-west of the constellation Taurus. At a distance of about 444 light years, it is among the nearest star clusters to Earth. It is the nearest Messier object to Earth, and is the most obvious cluster to the naked eye in the night sky. It is also observed to house the reflection nebula NGC 1432, an HII region.
Galileo Galilei was the first astronomer to view the Pleiades through a telescope. He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim to be seen with the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades



The Nebra sky disk, dated circa 1600 BC. The cluster of dots in the upper right portion of the disk is believed to be the Pleiades.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades
And thus the Pleiades are seen as a cluster of seven stars, as we can see from this Nebra disk.
Number 1
In the Babylonian star catalog, the Pleiades is called MULMUL, meaning ‘star star.’:
The Babylonian star catalogues name the Pleiades MULMUL (𒀯𒀯), meaning ‘stars’ (literally ‘star star’), and they head the list of stars along the ecliptic, reflecting the fact that they were close to the point of vernal equinox around the 23rd century BC.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades
In Mesopotamia, this constellation was represented in the above way.
In India the Pleiades are called: 'Krittika'. It is one of the 28 nakshatras, a Hindu star system that already was known in the Indus Culture:
3. Krittika — ‘The One Who Cuts’
Range: 26°40' Aries — 10°00' Taurus (-) Animal symbol: Sheep or Goat Primary Motivation: Kama Enemy: Vishakha
Published: en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
As you can see, the symbolic animals of this nakshatra are a sheep and a goat. This also appears to have been the case in the Harappa Civilization.



B-12 a
And thus, on this stamp, found it Banawali, Krittika is symbolized by seven small cones. In the previous table, we can see that a goat or a sheep is the symbolic animal of this nakshatra, which means that both the seven cones and the sheep symbolize Krittika. (The tree on top represents the fire god Agni, the presiding deity of this nakshatra.)
Rigveda 5-1 Agni
1. Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch-cow.
Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of heaven.
B-10 A
On this stamp we see seven dashes at the top, which of course represent Krittika. Besides that, the (Markhor) goat is its symbolic animal. So, together the seven dashes as well as the goat symbolize this nakshatra. (The trident indicates that Agni protects the embryo:)
Khanda 21
1. In the fourth month (Leo) the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the
embryo),
2. Sacrificing six oblations from a mess of cooked food with (the six verses of the hymn), 'Agni, joined with the prayer':
Rigveda 10-162 Agni
1. May Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Raksas-slayer, drive away The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.
2 Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of the flesh,
The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb. 3 That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo, That which will kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive far away. (Etc.)



According to the next table a knife is one of the symbols of Krittika:
3 Krittika
an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Pleiades Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun) Symbol: Knife or spear Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire
Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
Stone Tools of Indus Valley Civilisation Stone Saws heritage.gov.pk
This photograph depicts two stone knives from the Ancient Indus Valley Civilization.
H-286 A
And on this small tablet a knife is depicted standing on the right, next to a human figure.
H-286 B
A goat or ram is depicted on the other side. So on this tablet we see that a knife is depicted on one side and a ram on the other side: both symbolize Krittika.



B-11 A
A knife is also depicted on this stamp, which is unfortunately broken. This time this knife is situated in front of a Markhor goat. Both the knife and the goat symbolize Krittika.
B-8a
The surprising thing is that according to this table the Rigvedic name of Krittika is Agni:
3 Krittika
an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Pleiades Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun) Symbol: Knife or spear
Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire
Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
We saw earlier that the symbolic animals of Krittika are goats or sheep: if the Rigvedic name of this nakshatra is indeed Agni, then the fire god is of course also symbolized by a goat or a sheep. And that is why all the previous rams and goats with their fiery horns may represent Krittika as well as Agni.



B-5 A
In the Rigveda we can read several times that Agni may grant us food and offspring:
Rigveda 1-96 Agni
8 May the Wealth-Giver grant us conquering riches; may the Wealth-Giver grant us wealth with heroes. May the Wealth-Giver grant us food with offspring, and length of days may the WealthGiver send us.
The goat or sheep, the womb sign and the two dashes may indicate this.
This womb sign is an Indus variant of a symbolic abstract representations of external female genital:
‘Six symbolic abstract representations of external female genitals which have been used in various historical/cultural contexts. Upper left: A schematized drawing of the pubic triangle; among other things, this is the earliest archaic form of the ancient Sumerian cuneiform sign MUNUS (meaning ‘woman’.)
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vulva_symbols.svg
So the stamp shows a goat or a sheep together with a womb sign. When this is the case something is suggested, namely: the goat or sheep suggests that Agni fathers a child and the womb sign suggests that this child is born about nine months later. Moreover, the two dashes in the middle symbolize 'beans' and 'grain', indicating that Agni grants us food too.



K-34 A
A goat and a fish are depicted on this stamp. The goat represents Agni in Krittika: the animal suggests that the fire god gives offspring:
Rigveda 1-23 Vayu and Others
24 Fill me with splendour, Agni; give offspring and length of days; the Gods Shall know me even as I am, and Indra with the Rsis, know.
It will be understood that if this offspring is begotten in Krittika by Agni, it may be born in Pisces about ten months later. This constellation is of course symbolized by the fish.
K-37 a
A sheep and a fish are depicted on this stamp. The sheep represents Agni in Krittika and the fish can represent Varuna among others:
25 Shatabhisha
‘Comprising a hundred physicians’ Sadachbia Astrological Mate: Rahu (North lunar node) Symbol: Empty circle, 1,000 flowers or stars
Rigvedic name: Varuna, god of celestial waters
Indian zodiac: 6° 40′ – 20° Kumbha Western zodiac: 2° 40′ – 16° Pisces
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
According to this table the water god Varuna is the Rigvedic name of Shatabhisha. In the Indus Valley Civilization his animal symbols were a fish and a crocodile. And thus, the images on the stamp suggested that Agni gave life to a child, who may have been born in Varuna/Shatabhisha.



M-1179 a
On this stamp Agni is again depicted as a Markhor goat. In Krittika he will give life to a child. Then this child may have been born in Sravana about nine months later. The river goddess Saraswati is the deity of this nakshatra and is of course symbolized by the two meandering lines:
23; 20 Sravana (hearing or ear) Range: 10°00' — 23°20' Capricorn Symbol: ear, trident, row of three uneven footsteps Deity: Vishnu, Saraswati Mode of Functioning: Passive Cast: Mleccha Gender: Male Body parts: ears, genitals Humor (Ayur Vedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: south, northwest Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): air Gana (Type): Godly Orientation: Upward Disposition: Moveable Ruling Planet: Moon Sounds: Ju, Je, Jo, Gha Animal symbol: monkey Primary Motivation: Artha
Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
So, the goat on this stamp suggests that in Agni gives life to a child in Krittika. This child is born about nine months later in Sravana with the help of Saraswati.



As I have already written in other essays that arrows are depicted on Ancient Near East cylinder seals as well as on Indus Valley stamps. In Sumer these arrows indicated a number of concepts:
In Sumer the word ‘Ti’ means ‘arrow’, ‘timber’, ’rib’ and it also means ‘life’.
http://www.volker-doormann.org/slavery.htm.
Nevertheless, on the cylinders seals they mean ‘life’. In the Indus Valley Civilization arrows had different meanings.
H-2144 A
Here is such an Indus arrow, it may symbolize ‘The Arrow of Love’ as it is described in the next Khanta from the Atharva-Veda-Samhita:
III, 25. To command a woman's love.
1. Let the up-thruster thrust thee up; do not abide in thine own lair; the arrow of love that is terrible, therewith I pierce thee in the heart. 2. The arrow feathered with longing, tipped with love, necked with resolve — having made that wellstraightened, let love pierce thee in the heart. 3. The well-straightened arrow of love which dries the spleen, forward winged, consuming—therewith I pierce thee in the heart. 4. Pierced with consuming pain, dry-mouthed, do thou come creeping to me, gentle, with fury allayed, entirely [mine], pleasant-spoken, submissive. 5. I goad thee hither with a goad, away from mother, likewise from father, that thou mayest be in my power, mayest come unto my intent. 6. Do ye, O Mitra-and-Varuna, cast out the intents from her heart; then, making her powerless, make her [to be] in my own control.
Atharva-Veda-Samhita Translated With A Critical And Exegetical Commentary By William Dwight Whitney
About the arrow see: ‘The meaning of arrows depicted on Indus stamps, according to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 (Ritual rules for birth)’

H-1687 A
But an arrow can also stand in for an embryo which is being engendered, because according to a hymn in The Atharva-Veda-Samhita a male embryo may come into a womb as an arrow to a quiver:
.
Book III, 23. For fecundity.
1. By what thou hast become barren, that we make disappear from thee ; that now we set down elsewhere, far away from (dpa) thee.
2. Unto thy womb let a foetus come, a male one, as an arrow to a quiver; let a hero be born unto
thee here, a ten-months' son. 3. Give birth to a male, a son ; after him let a male be born ; mayest thou be mother of sons, of those born and whom thou shalt bear. 4. And what excellent seeds the bulls generate, with them do thou acquire (vid) a son ; become thou a productive milch-cow. 5. I perform for thee the [ceremony] of Prajapati ; let a foetus come to thy womb ; acquire thou a son, O woman, who shall be weal for thee; weal also for him do thou become. 6. The plants of which heaven has been the father, earth the mother, ocean the root —let those herbs of the gods (datva) favor thee, in order to acquisition of a son.
Book III. The Atharva-Veda-Samhita. Translated With A Critical And Exegetical Commentary By William Dwight Whitney
And in the ‘Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25’ we read something similar: a male embryo enters a womb as an arrow the quiver:
.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda Khanda 19
6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son
after ten months. 'Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth. 'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhâtar (possessing; bearing), thus Pragâpati has said. 'Pragâpati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man. 'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
Arrows are carved on the following stamps and therefore we can assume that these stamps depict scenes from this 'Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25'.



M-956
This stamp shows an arrow with a knife next to it. This knife suggests that the male embryo enters the womb like an arrow in Krittika, because according to the next table this nakshatra is symbolized by a knife.
3 Krittika, an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun) Symbol: Knife or spear Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire
Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
It is plausible that in itself an arrow can already be linked with Krittika which is symbolized by a knife or a spear, and according to the next table, by an axe, a razor, and by a blade:
3. Krittika — ‘The One Who Cuts’
Range: 26°40' Aries — 10°00' Taurus Symbol: axe, razor, blade, knife, flame, peacock Deity: Karttikeya, Agni (God of fire) Mode of Functioning: Active Caste: priestly or brahminical Gender: Female Body parts: hips, loins and the crown of the head Humor (Ayurvedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: the arc covering the directions from east, south-east to south Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): Earth Gana (Type): Rakshasa (demonic) Orientation: Downward Disposition: Mixed (alternates between sharp and soft) Ruling Planet: Sun Sounds: A, Ee, Oo, Ay Animal symbol: Sheep or Goat Primary Motivation: Kama Enemy: Vishakha
Published: en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
It is clear that an arrow is related to these tools and weapons, so it is not unreasonable to link it to the nakshatra Krittika.



H-698 A
This Indus tablet shows a stone knife on the left, an arrow in the middle, and a fish on the right. It will be clear by now that these three signs suggest a story.
o The knife is a symbol for the nakshatra Agni/Krittika.
o The arrow symbolizes a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow the quiver.
o And the fish symbolizes that a child is born about nine months later in Pisces.
H-698 B
A bull is depicted on the other side. Once again, this animal can of course be linked to Taurus in the first place: from 4320 to 2160 BCE, the new year started when the sun entered this constellation.
Again, in 'Älteste Indische Dichtung und Prosa' by Klaus Mylius we can read:
‘Diese angenehmen Samentropfen, die die Männer für uns erzeugen, aus diesen gebare du einen Sohn; sei eine gut gebarende Milchkuh! Brülle, bewege dich, lege den Embryo in (sie) empfangen;
einen Stier, o Stier, lege in (sie)!’ Älteste Indische Dichtung und Prosa Klaus Mylius
Translated into English:
‘These agreeable drops of semen that men produce for us, from these you bear a son; be a goodbearing dairy cow! Roar, move, put the embryo in (her) conceive; a bull, o bull, put in (her)!’
So, an embryo is a bull put in the mother, which of course happened in Taurus.
On the tablet you can see that the bull is eating. This scene demonstrates that in Khanda 24 the father makes food and give it to eat to the child:
Khanda 24
3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon),
All in all, the knife and the arrow symbolize Krittika. This small nakshatra is situated in Taurus which is represented by the bull on the other side of the tablet.



M-1906
A number of Indus stamps have in common the three characters that are framed on this stamp: an arrow. three long lines and a ladle in a pot.
It is clear that these three signs can be linked to scenes from the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25. This Sutra describes eight ritual acts that must be performed before the conception of a son up to and including ten days after his birth.
In this Sutra Agni and his wife Svâhâ are mentioned just like a number of other gods, including Indra, Soma, Surya. But Kartikeya and Shashthi are not mentioned at all. This comes as a surprise to me, as I had always thought that these two deities were most important in the Indus Valley. Not so. Knowing that the inscription is linked to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra we can easily find out which gods are depicted on the many Indus stamps.
M-1161
As said before, the elephant is Indra's mount, but in the Indus Valley Civilization this big animal represented Indra himself. In the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19 it is written that Indra impregnates heaven:
5. Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!'
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
And thus the storm god is acting in this Sutra and that is why he is depicted on this stamp as an elephant.



M-85 a
The bird at the right may represent Svaha. When Agni’s seed burned, she transformed herself into a bird and dropped it into a golden pot:
At this time, the goddess Svaha desired Agni and resolved to seduce him through trickery. After
transforming herself to look like one of the sages’ wives, she made love to him. But because Agni’s
seed burned, she transformed herself into a bird and dropped it into a golden pot far away on a
mountain plateau. Six times she took on the form of one of the wives, and each time she left the seed in the pot on the mountain.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaha
She is depicted on this stamp as she may give birth to the male embryo that enter the womb as an arrow the quiver in Krittika.
M-631 A
On this stamp the bird at the right may represent Svaha too. It may be linked to Aquilae:
23 Shravana α, β and γ Aquilae
Astrological Mate: Chandra (Moon) Symbol: Ear or Three Footprints Rigvedic name: Vishnu, preserver of universe Indian zodiac: 0° – 23° 20′ Makara Western zodiac: 6° – 19° 20′ Aquarius
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
This means that the two stamps tells us that a male embryo enters a womb as an arrow the quiver in Krittika. As a baby it is born about nine months later in Aquilae, which is suggested by the bird.



M-1776
Pragâpati is mentioned in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra. He may equated to Brahman:
Prajapati (Sanskrit: प्रजापति , romanized: Prajāpati, lit. 'Lord of creation') is a Vedic deity of Hinduism. In later literature, Prajapati is identified with the creator-god Brahma.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajapati
The mount of Brahman is Hamsa, a goose, a swan, or even a flamingo:
The hamsa (Sanskrit: हंसhaṃsa or hansa) is an aquatic migratory bird, referred to in ancient Sanskrit texts which various scholars have interpreted as being based on the goose, the swan, or even the flamingo.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa_(bird)
And thus, on the stamp the goose or swan at the right may represent Brahma/Prajāpati.
But the bird is also related to the Nakshatra Abijit. Besides that, Brahma is one of two deities of this nakshatra:
Abhijit nakshatra lord planet - Mercury or Ketu Abhijit nakshatra symbol - Horse Head
Abhijit nakshatra deity or lord - Lord Brahma or Mahavishnu
Abhijit nakshatra Gana - Deva Abhijit nakshatra Element - Prithvi or Earth Abhijit nakshatra Animal - Male Horse and Female Elephant
Abhijit nakshatra Bird - Hamsa (Swan)
Abhijit nakshatra Tree - Poison Nut Tree Abhijit nakshatra Lucky Number - 7 and 9 Abhijit nakshatra Lucky letter - J and K. Abhijit nakshatra Lucky Color - Brownish Yellow
https://instaastro.com/nakshatra/abhijit/
This means that the stamp above tells us that a male embryo enter a womb, as an arrow the quiver in Krittika. As a baby it is born about nine months later in Abhijit, which is indicated by the swan.



M-308 A
And here is another surprise: on this stamp the deity standing in the middle may represent the Âgya salve and the two tigers may represent ‘malady’ this salve is driving away:
Khanda 21 3. With (the verses), 'From thy eyes, thy nose', verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
Rigveda 10-163
1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin, Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2. From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine, From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart, From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet, From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails, From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
Besides that the two tigers may represent a twin, which is the symbol of Uttara Bhādrapadā:
26; 4 Uttara Bhādrapadā
‘the second of the blessed feet’ γ Pegasi and α Andromedae Lord: Shani (Saturn) Symbol : Twins, back legs of funeral cot, snake in the water Deity : Ahir Budhyana, serpent or dragon of the deep Indian zodiac: 3°20' - 16°40' Meena ; Western zodiac 29°20' Pisces - 12°40' Aries Andromeda constellation map (1).png
Published: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
This means that the stamp above tells us that a male embryo enters a womb as an arrow the quiver in Krittika. About nine months later a child is born in Uttara Bhādrapadā. This nakshatra is symbolized by the two tigers.



About the rhinoceros and the unicorn
M-276 AC
I always thought that the rhinoceros embodied Kartikeya, the son of Agni and Svâhâ. This appears not to be the case because Kartikeya is not mentioned in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra. It turns out that this rhinoceros embodies Agni, the fire god, himself, who is called ‘a bull with sharpened horn’ in a Rigveda hymn:
Rigveda 6-16 Agni
39 Mighty as one who slays with shafts, or like a bull with sharpened horn, Agni, thou breakest down the forts.
Besides that, in Khmer art, Agni has been depicted with a rhinoceros as his vahana.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni
The god agni on a rhinoceros -- an iconographic tradition that is widespread in East Asia & the archipelago (where the animal might also be assigned to kumAra). We posit that this iconography might have emerged from the rhinoceros manifestation (vibhava) of viShNu that has faded.
https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1532566522593480716/photo/2
And thus we must accept that in the Indus Valley Civilization a rhinoceros represented Agni.



Photo of Bhimbetka Rock paintings by LR Burdak https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bhimbetka.JPG
A bull embodies Agni too. Here is a rock painting of an Indian aurochs, the wild ancestor of the domestic zebu cattle:
Drawing based on an aurochs bull skeleton from Lund and a cow skeleton from Cambridge, with characteristic features of the aurochs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs#/media/File:Aurochsfeatures.jpg
The Indian aurochs[a] (Bos primigenius namadicus; Sindhi: انڊين جهنگلي ڏاند ) is an extinct aurochs subspecies that is considered the wild ancestor of the domestic zebu cattle, which is mainly found in the Indian subcontinent and has been introduced in many other parts of the world, like Africa and South America. In contrast, the domesticated taurine cattle breeds, which are native to Europe, the Near East, and other parts of the world, are descendants of the Eurasian aurochs (Bos primigenius primigenius). According to IUCN, the Indian aurochs disappeared before the 13th century AD, leaving only the Bos primigenius primigenius, whose range was by then restricted to Europe. The wild population of Indian aurochs was likely extinct millennia earlier than that; the most recent skeletal remains, from Uttar Pradesh, date from around 1,800 BC.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_aurochs
It still lived during the Mature Harappa Civilization.
M-753A
I think that the unicorn has the hors of an Indian aurochs. It is depicted as a unicorn, showing one horn instead of two, because in this way it is linked to the rhinoceros, which embodies the fire god too.



M-1662
Again, many times Agni is called: ‘the Bull’. This should not be a surprise, as Agni is the presiding deity of Krittika, as this small nakshatra is situated in Taurus the fire god can be embodied by a bull:
Rigveda 10-187 Agni
1. To Agni send I forth my song, to him the Bull of all the folk: So may he bear us past our foes. 2 Who from the distance far away shines brilliantly across the wastes: So may he bear us past our foes. 3 The Bull with brightly-gleaming flame who utterly consumes the fiends So may he bear us past our foes. 4 Who looks on all existing things and comprehends them with his view: So may he bear us past our foes. 5 Resplendent Agni, who was born in farthest region of the air: So may he bear us past our foes.
He is a Bull of all folk and whets and brandishes his horns:
Rigveda 8-49 Agni
13 Agni is even as a bull who whets and brandishes his horns.
Well-sharpened are his jaws which may not be withstood: the Child of Strength hath powerful teeth. 14 Not to be stayed, O Bull, O Agni, are thy teeth when thou art spreading far and wide.
He is bellowing to the earth and heavens:
Rigveda 10-8 Agni
1. Agni advances with his lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to the earth and heavens.
He hath attained the sky's supremest limits. the Steer hath waxen in the lap of waters. 2 The Bull, the youngling with the hump, hath frolicked, the strong and never-ceasing Calf hath bellowed.
And he is a youngling with the hump.



Bagasra 4
He is like a bull with sharpened horn:
Rigveda 6-16 Agni
39 Mighty as one who slays with shafts, or like a bull with sharpened horn, Agni, thou breakest down the forts.
His hair is flame:
Rigveda 1-127 Agni
Thee, wandering round as 't were the sky, who art the invoking Priest of men, Whom, Bull with hair of flame the people must observe, the people that he speed them on.
He has teeth of flame:
Rigveda 1-58 Agni
5 With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds, triumphant like a bull among the herd of cows,
His tongue is like the sharp stone weapon:
Rigveda 6-6 Agni
5 Forth darts the Bull's tongue like the sharp stone weapon discharged by him who fights to win the cattle. Agni's fierce flame is like a hero's onset: dread and resistless he destroys the forests.
And he has seven tongued flames (number of the Pleiades).
Rigveda 3-6 Agni
2 Thou at thy birth didst fill both earth and heaven, yea, Most Adorable, thou didst exceed them. Even through the heaven's and through the earth's expanses let thy swift seven tongued flames (Pleiades) roll on, O Agni.



M-757
In a Rigveda hymn, Agni is said to have a pointed flame. This, of course, corresponds to the one horn of the bull:
Rigveda 7-1 Agni
1. The men from fire-sticks, with their hands' swift movement, have, in deep thought, engendered glorious Agni, Far-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the homestead.
It is also said that Agni has a sharpened flame and in this we can also recognize the one horn of the bull:
Rigveda 8-43 Agni
26 Slaying things deadly, burning up foes, Riksasas, on every side, Shine, Agni, with thy sharpened flame.
He has a piercing flame:
Rigveda 8-60 Agni.
10 Let our songs come anear to him beauteous and bright with piercing flame Our offerings, with our homage, to the Lord of wealth, to him whom many praise, for help: 14 Solicit with your chants, for help, Agni the God with piercing flame, For riches famous Agni, Purumilha and ye men! Agni to light our dwelling well.
The unicorn holds its head with the horn up almost all the time: This could express that fire god has a high heaven touching flame:
Rigveda 5-11 Agni
1. The watchful Guardian of the people hath been born, Agni, the very strong, for fresh prosperity. With oil upon his face, with high heaven touching flame, he shineth splendidly, pure, for the Bharatas.
It may also show that Agni supports with his flame the height of heaven.
Rigveda 3-5 Agni
10 Best of all luminaries lofty Agni supported with his flame the height of heaven,
When, far from Bhrgus, Matarisvan kindled the oblation-bearer where he lay in secret.



M-681
We now look at this Indus sign. It is a flat depiction of a Sacred Fire as it can still be seen in perspective in the next photo.
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2000/04/sacred-flames-vedic-fire-ceremony-celebrates-hinduism/
Here is an image of a Sacred Fire, the fire place is made of stone square bins.
M-1103
A fire sign is also engraved on this stamp as on a number of other stamps. When we study the position of these marks on this stamp and on other ones, we can conclude that these marks do indeed symbolize a fire place.



M-828
On this stamp the fire sign depicted on the left suggests that fire, so Agni, is the creating god. In the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 this is also the case, for the earth is pregnant with Agni:
Khanda 19
5. Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni,
Sacred Fire At Traditional Hindu Wedding https://www.storyblocks.com/video/stock/sacred-fire-at-traditional-hindu-wedding-in-jodhpur-gcc28qp
This is another picture of a Sacred Fire.
M-925 a
And on this stamp the unicorn as well as the ‘fire-place’ indicate Agni as because in the
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra the fire god gives life to a child twice: during his conceiving and after his birth.



H-67 a
The unicorn embodies Agni again and the fire god is linked to the nakshatra Krittika, which is symbolized by a flame:
3. Krittika — ‘The One Who Cuts’
Range: 26°40' Aries — 10°00' Taurus Symbol: axe, razor, blade, knife, flame, peacock Deity: Karttikeya, Agni (God of fire) Mode of Functioning: Active en.vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
In Krittika Agni gives offspring:
Rigveda 1-23 Vayu and Others
24 Fill me with splendour, Agni; give offspring and length of days; the Gods Shall know me even as I am, and Indra with the Rsis, know.
This offspring may be born about nine months later. When the son is born Agni still gives life, which is symbolized by the Sacred Fire sign:
Khanda 25
'(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis;
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25, Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
This happens in Purva Bhadrapada and Uttara Bhadrapada, because the four dashes symbolized the front and back legs of a funeral cot:
26 Purva Bhadrapada
‘the first of the blessed feet’ α and β Pegasi Astrological Mate: Guru (Jupiter) Symbol: Swords or two front legs of funeral cot, man with two faces Rigvedic name: Ajaikapada, an ancient fire dragon Indian zodiac: 20° Kumbha – 3° 20′ Meena Western zodiac: 16° – 29° 20′ Pisces

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra



M-1066
This piece of an Indus stamp shows a vulva sign divided into six. I thought that it
represented the vulva of Shashthi (whose name literally means: ‘Sixth’). But I now think that it symbolizes Svaha, the wife of Agni:
In the Mahabharata Vana Parva, Markandeya narrates her story to the Pandavas. Svaha was the daughter of Daksha. She fell in love with the God of Fire, Agni, and was pursuing him. Agni did not notice her. He presided over the sacrificial rituals of the Saptarishis. The deity became highly besotted with the wives of the Saptarishis who were so ravishing that he kept staring at them.
Finally, Agni could not bear the guilt of longing for wives belonging to someone else and he went to the forests to perform penances. Svaha followed him and understood his desire. She took the forms of the wives of the Saptarishis (though she was unable to take the form of Arundhati, wife of Vashishtha) and approached Agni six times, seducing him and throwing the seed of each union into a golden pot, from which Skanda was born.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaha
She took the forms of the wives of the Saptarishis and approached Agni six times, and that is why she is symbolized by a six-divided womb sign.
H-649
In the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 her name is mentioned after Rigveda verses:
Khanda 19
1. Let him pound the root of the Adhyândâ plant (Prisniparnî ('speckled-leaf,' Hemionitis cordifolia) Hemionitis cordifolia); and sprinkle it at the time of her monthly period with the two (verses), Rig-veda X, 85, 21. 22),
21 Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. I laud Visvavasu (Some of the most prominent gandharvas include Tumburu, Visvavasu (who was the father of Pramadvara), with hymns and homage. Seek in her father's home another fair one, and find the portion from of old assigned thee. 22 Rise up from hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee. Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride.
with Svâhâ at the end of each, into her right nostril. Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
As she is the wife of Agni she gives birth to the children he creates and among others she is symbolized by the six-divided womb like on the stamp above.



M-86
A six-divided womb sign symbolizing Svâhâ is also depicted on this stamp. Again, according to Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 24 her name has to be mentioned several times:
Khanda 24
8. If he likes (let him do so) with the words, 'Bhûh! The Rig-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Bhuvah! The Yagur-veda I lay into thee, N.N., Svâhâ! 'Svah! The Sâma-veda I lay into thee, N.N., Svâhâ! 'Bhûr bhuvah svah! Vâkovâkya (colloquies), Itihâsa, and Purâna—Om! All the Vedas I lay into thee, N.N., Svâhâ!'
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
M-163
Here is another six-divided womb sign depicted on the right. In this way it suggests that Svâhâ gives birth to a child Agni, depicted as a unicorn, created.



K-65 a
Khesin Devasena Kartikeya Valli Kartikeya
I have thought that Kartikeya was the most important god of the Harappa Civilization because some cylinder seals and stamps had a story told on them, and this story was about Kartikeya and his wives Valli and Devasena.
On the left of this imprint of a cylinder seal Kartikeya fights with Khesin because of Devasena, who is standing in-between them.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartikeya.
M309
Valli Kartikeya
On this seal a tiger represents Kartikeya and a girl, seated in a neem tree (Azadirachta indica), is his wife Valli. Both the tiger and tree make sense when we know that in a legend Subramaniam (another name of Kartikeya) turned himself into a ‘vengai’, a tiger. ‘Vengai’ is also the name given to the neem tree in its male aspect before it flowers:
‘In Tamil Nadu, there is a legend that Subramaniam (another name of Kartikeya), the son of Shiva and the forest mothers, loved an aboriginal virgin named Valli. To win her love he turned himself into a ‘vengai’, a tiger. ‘Vengai’ is also the name given to the neem tree in its male aspect before it flowers.’
Book of Durga, by Chitgopekar, Nilima



M-1186 A
And this impressive stamp shows the birth of Kartikeya:
In the Mahabharata Vana Parva, Markandeya narrates her story to the Pandavas. Svaha was the daughter of Daksha. She fell in love with the God of Fire, Agni, and was pursuing him. Agni did not notice her. He presided over the sacrificial rituals of the Saptarishis. The deity became highly besotted with the wives of the Saptarishis who were so ravishing that he kept staring at them.
Finally, Agni could not bear the guilt of longing for wives belonging to someone else and he went to the forests to perform penances. Svaha followed him and understood his desire. She took the forms of the wives of the Saptarishis (though she was unable to take the form of Arundhati, wife of Vashishtha) and approached Agni six times, seducing him and throwing the seed of each union into a golden pot, from which Skanda was born.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svaha
I thought these story stamps were the norm. Nevertheless, despite these impressive cylinder seals and stamps, Kartikeya and Shashthi were not the predominant gods in the Mature Harappa Civilization, but just from the number of unicorns depicted on the Indus Valley stamps, we must conclude that Agni and Svâhâ were the most important gods in that period.
