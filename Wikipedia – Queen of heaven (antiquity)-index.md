Queen of heaven (antiquity)
Queen of Heaven was a title given to a number of ancient sky
goddesses worshipped throughout the ancient Mediterranean and
Near East during ancient times. Goddesses known to have been
referred to by the title include Inanna, Anat, Isis, Astarte, and
possibly Asherah (by the prophet Jeremiah). In Greco-Roman times
Hera, and her Roman aspect Juno bore this title. Forms and content
of worship varied. In modern times, the title "Queen of Heaven" is
still used by contemporary pagans to refer to the Great Goddess,
while Catholics, Orthodox, and some Anglican Christians now apply
the ancient title to Mary, the mother of Jesus.
Inanna
Main article: Inanna
Inanna was the Sumerian
goddess of love and war.
Despite her association with
mating and fertility of humans
and animals, Inanna was not a
mother goddess, and is rarely
associated with childbirth.[1]
Inanna was also associated with rain and storms and with the planet
Venus.[2]
Although the title of Queen of Heaven was often applied to many
different goddesses throughout antiquity, Inanna is the one to whom
the title is given the most number of times. In fact, Inanna's name is
commonly derived from Nin-anna which literally means "Queen of
Heaven" in ancient Sumerian (It comes from the words NIN meaning
"lady" and AN meaning "sky"),[3] although the cuneiform sign for her



name (Borger 2003 nr. 153, U+12239 !) is not historically a ligature
of the two. In several myths, Inanna is described as being the
daughter of Nanna, the ancient Sumerian god of the Moon.[4] In
other texts, however, she is often described as being the daughter of
either Enki or An.[5][6][7] These difficulties have led some early
Assyriologists to suggest that Inanna may have been originally a
Proto-Euphratean goddess, possibly related to the Hurrian mother
goddess Hannahannah, accepted only latterly into the Sumerian
pantheon, an idea supported by her youthfulness, and that, unlike
the other Sumerian divinities, she at first had no sphere of
responsibilities.[8] The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean
substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely
accepted by modern Assyriologists.[9] In Sumer Inanna was hailed as
"Queen of Heaven" in the third millennium BC. In Akkad to the north,
she was worshipped later as Ishtar. In the Sumerian Descent of
Inanna, when Inanna is challenged at the outermost gates of the
underworld, she replies:[10]
I am Inanna, Queen of Heaven,
On my way to the East
Her cult was deeply embedded in Mesopotamia and among the
Canaanites to the west. F. F. Bruce describes a transformation from a
Venus as a male deity to Ishtar, a female goddess by the Akkadians.
He links Ishtar, Tammuz, Innini, Ma (Cappadocia), Mami, Dingir-Mah,
Cybele, Agdistis, Pessinuntica and the Idaean Mother to the cult of a
great Mother-goddess.[11]
Astarte
The goddess, the Queen of Heaven, whose worship Jeremiah so
vehemently opposed, may have been possibly Astarte. Astarte is the
name of a goddess as known from Northwestern Semitic regions,



cognate in name, origin and functions with the goddess Ishtar in
Mesopotamian texts. Another transliteration is ‘Ashtart; other names
for the goddess include Hebrew עשתרת (transliterated Ashtoreth),
Ugaritic ‘ṯtrt (also ‘Aṯtart or ‘Athtart), Akkadian
D
As-tar-tú (also
Astartu) and Etruscan Uni-Astre (Pyrgi Tablets).
According to scholar Mark S. Smith, Astarte may be the Iron Age
(after 1200 BC) incarnation of the Bronze Age (to 1200 BC) Asherah.
[12]
Astarte was connected with fertility, sexuality, and war. Her symbols
were the lion, the horse, the sphinx, the dove, and a star within a
circle indicating the planet Venus. Pictorial representations often
show her naked. Astarte was accepted by the Greeks under the
name of Aphrodite. The island of Cyprus, one of Astarte's greatest
faith centers, supplied the name Cypris as Aphrodite's most common
byname. Asherah was worshipped in ancient Israel as the consort of
El and in Judah as the consort of Yahweh and Queen of Heaven (the
Hebrews baked small cakes for her festival):
[13]
"Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the fathers
kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes
to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other
gods, that they may provoke me to anger."
[14]
"... to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out
drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers,
our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the
streets of Jerusalem ..."
[15]
Hebrew Bible references
Worship of a "Queen of Heaven" (Hebrew מלכת השמים , Malkath



haShamayim) is recorded in the Book of Jeremiah, in the context of
the Prophet condemning such religious worship as blasphemy and a
violation of the teachings of the God of Israel. In Jeremiah 7h18:
The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the
women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the Queen
of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke
me to anger.[16]
In Jeremiah 44h15-18:
Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense
to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a
large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper
Egypt, said to Jeremiah, "We will not listen to the message you
have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! We will certainly do
everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen
of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and
our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of
food and were well off and suffered no harm. But ever since we
stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out
drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been
perishing by sword and famine."[17]
There was a temple of Yahweh in Egypt at that time, the 6th-7th
centuries BC, that was central to the Jewish community at
Elephantine in which Yahweh was worshipped in conjunction with the
goddess Anath (also named in the temple papyri as Anath-Bethel
and Anath-Iahu).[18]
The goddesses Asherah, Anath and Astarte first appear as distinct
and separate deities in the tablets discovered in the ruins of the
library of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria). Some biblical



scholars[who?] tend to regard these goddesses as one, especially
under the title "Queen of heaven".
John Day states that "there is nothing in first-millennium BC texts
that singles out Asherah as 'Queen of Heaven' or associates her
particularly with the heavens at all."[19] F. F. Bruce, an evangelical
(Biblical) scholar differentiates between Astarte and Asherah as two
distinct feminine deities.[20]
Isis
Main article: Isis
Isis was venerated first in Egypt. As per the Greek historian
Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, Isis was the only goddess
worshiped by all Egyptians alike,[21] and whose influence was so
widespread by that point, that she had become completely syncretic
with the Greek goddess Demeter.[22] It is after the conquest of Egypt
by Alexander the Great, and the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture
initiated by Ptolemy I Soter, that she eventually became known as
'Queen of Heaven'.[23]Lucius Apuleius confirms this in Book 11, Chap
47 of his novel, The Golden Ass, in which his character prays to the
"Queen of Heaven". The goddess herself responds to his prayer,
delivering a lengthy monologue in which she explicitly identifies
herself as both the Queen of Heaven and Isis.
Then with a weeping countenance, I made this orison to the
puissant Goddess, saying: O blessed Queen of Heaven...
Thus the divine shape breathing out the pleasant spice of fertile
Arabia, disdained not with her divine voice to utter these words
unto me: Behold Lucius I am come, thy weeping and prayers has
moved me to succor thee. I am she that is the natural mother of
all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial



progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, Queen of Heaven... and
the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine,
and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do
call me Queen Isis.[24]
