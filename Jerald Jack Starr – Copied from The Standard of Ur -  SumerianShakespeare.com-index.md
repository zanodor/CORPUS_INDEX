This Sumerian “tablet” was found in Bulgaria, of all places. The New York
Times reports, “Acting on a tip, the police raided four homes in eastern
Bulgaria, looking for contraband that regularly traverses this country on
the way to markets in Western Europe and America. In one rusting shed
behind an apartment block here, they found a cache of looted antiquities:
19 classical statues and fragments of marble or limestone.
Among them was a square tablet depicting a procession. If genuine, its
style would make it neither Roman nor Greek, like the rest, but even older,
dating back nearly 5,000 years. Its appearance suggested it came from the
ancient Sumerian city of Lagash, in what is today southern Iraq.
McGuire Gibson of the University of Chicago, a leading expert on
Mesopotamian art, reviewed a photograph of the tablet and noted unusual
features, like a smooth bore hole in the center, that suggested it could be a
well-made reproduction. But he added, “If that were real, they could sell it
for millions.”
The article goes on to state that the tablet may have been sold by the
Islamic State (ISIS) which uses the sale of stolen artifacts to help fund its
campaign of terrorism. The tablet was confiscated and it is now being held
in the Shumen Regional Historical Museum in Bulgaria.
I suggest the “tablet” is actually a plaque. It is probably a back-plate for a
door handle.

A votive plaque dedicated to the god Dumuzi by king Lugalzagesi.
I further suggest that the plaque is from the city of Ur, not Lagash, as
stated in the article.
Ur is the most likely choice for the provenance of the plaque because all of
the images on it look like they were copied from the “peace side” of the
Standard of Ur.
The Royal Standard of Ur, peace side.
The plaque shows people in a religious procession going to the temple.
Unfortunately, the temple is hidden beneath the tape.

In the procession is a long-haired priest. His hands are folded in prayer.
Because of the long hair, it’s tempting to say this a woman, and thus a
priestess rather than a priest. Although Sumerian priests were usually
shown with shaven heads, some of them had long hair (or wore a wig), as
shown below on the Standard of Ur (left) and on a plaque from the city
Mari:
The long-haired priests have their hands folded in prayer.

“garlanded
for the sacrifice”.
The same exact scene is on the Standard of Ur.
Part of the procession includes Akkadians bearing tribute to the
conquering Sumerian king. They carry the tribute in bags and in
backpacks.

The Akkadians are led by a Sumerian. He performs the gesture of
obedience for his king
and the gods.

Notice the distinctive “angled-skirt” of the Akkadians. It is the same kind
of skirt that is shown on the Standard of Ur.

A pair of Akkadians carry tribute in a bag and a backpack. The backpack is
supported by a head strap, like the one shown on the plaque. The
backpacks were elaborate contraptions,
but they match in all their details.
Three pairs of Akkadians, bearing tribute in bags and backpacks, show up
in the second row
on the Standard of Ur.
The rams are herded forward in the procession.

The bodies of the rams blend together. This was a popular motif in
Mesopotamia.

A plaque from the city of Shuruppak.
A cylinder seal from Akkad.
The religious procession is accompanied by musicians.

The musicians are led by a man who holds his hands in the prayer
position. Behind him, a man plays a bull-headed lyre. He is followed by a
man carrying a flute.
A bull-headed lyre on the Standard of Ur.
We do not have a complete picture of the plaque, so there are probably
other scenes that mirrored those on the Standard of Ur.
Although some of the motifs shown above (the rams, the hands held in
prayer, and the
gesture of obedience) are rather formulaic, and they occur in other works
of art, many of the motifs on the plaque are very specific to the Standard
of Ur. They look like direct copies.

So now we need to ask the question:
Is the plaque genuine because it looks just like the Standard of Ur, or is it
a fake because it looks just like the Standard of Ur.
In other words, did an ancient artist copy the standard to conform to the
artistic conventions
in Ur at the time, or did a modern artist copy the standard merely to
create a forgery?
If genuine, the plaque is historically important, and worth millions. If it
can be associated with the king on the Standard of Ur, then it is priceless.
On the other hand, if the plaque is a fake, then it is just a clever fraud.
You have already seen all the evidence.
Take a moment to make up your own mind about the plaque. Is it real, or
just a fake?
