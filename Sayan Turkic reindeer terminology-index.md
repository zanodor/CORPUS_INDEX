Sayan Turkic reindeer terminology
Elisabetta Ragagnin
Freie Universität Berlin
1. Sayan Turkic languages and peoples
Sayan Turkic is the technical term used in Turcology to refer to the South-Siberian
branch of the Turkic language family, which includes standard Tuvan, Tofan and
various related languages spoken by small communities in neighbouring Mongolia,
China and Buryatia Sayan Turkic can be further divided into two groups: Steppe
Sayan Turkic and Taiga Sayan Turkic. To the former belong Standard Tuvan and its
dialects together with Altay-Sayan varieties spoken in China and western Mongolia,
and Uyghur-Uriankhay (Tuhan) of East Khövsgöl. The traditional lifestyle of Taiga
Sayan Turkic peoples used to be based on low-land i.e. steppe pastoralism,
characterized by herding of sheep, goats, cattle (cows and yaks), horses and camels.
The Taiga Sayan Turkic branch includes Tofan, the Toju variety of Tuvan and
some varieties of the Tere-Khöl area as well as Soyot of Buryatia and Dukhan of
Mongolia’s northern Khövsgöl Aimag. Reindeer breeding and hunting has
characterized the lifestyle of these groups until recently.1 During the last decades
reindeer herding has dramatically decreased in the Taiga-Sayan area - see, for
instance, Donahoe and Plumley (2003). Presently, reindeer herding is best
maintained among the Dukhan people.
2. The Dukhan people
Secluded in the northernmost regions of Mongolia’s Khövsgöl region – bordering in
the northeast with Buryatia and in the west with the Tuvan republic – the Dukhan
people total approximately 500 people and are divided into two main groups: those
of the “West Taiga” (barïïn dayga) originate from Tere Khöl, whereas those of the
“East Taiga” (ǰüün dayga) came from Toju, both of them regions in Tuva. Presently,

around 32 Dukhan families are reindeer herders in the surrounding taiga areas, on
the southern slopes of the Sayan mountains. They follow what has been called the
Sayan-type of reindeer breeding, characterized by small-size herds of reindeer used
as pack and riding animals and as a source of dairy products. (For more on the
Sayan-type of reindeer herding, see Vainshtein 1980). Hunting used to be an
important part of the Dukhan economy. However, the Mongolian government has
recently banned hunting and fishing and, in order to balance the impact of these
proscriptions, the Dukhan families were granted dwelling in the taiga and a state
pension for tending to reindeer, calculated on the basis of the number of family
members. The remaining Dukhan families have settled down in the village of
Tsagaan Nuur and in the neighbouring riverside areas, abandoning reindeer
breeding. Some families, however, regularly return to the taiga in the summer
months and tend to reindeer. Although the Dukhan people identify themselves as
duhha, in Mongolia they are generally called Tsaatan, a rather derogatory term
meaning ‘those who have reindeer’, stressing in this way the fact that they are not
like Mongolian herders. Recently the more neutral Mongolian term tsaačin ‘reindeer
herders’ has been introduced to refer to them.2
Nowadays, Dukhan is actively spoken by the older generation, that is, by
speakers older than 40. Younger Dukhans communicate in Darkhat-Mongolian,3
although they possess a passive knowledge of Dukhan. Furthermore, language shift
is more acute in Tsagaan Nuur and riverside areas, where most of the households
have already completely switched to Darkhat-Mongolian. For a linguistic
description of Dukhan, see Ragagnin (2011).
2 In the available published materials, Dukhans have been designated by several other names such as “Urianxay”, “Taiga Urianxay”, “Taigïn Irged” ‘peoples of the taiga’, “Oin Irged” ‘peoples of the forest’ and “Soiot” (Badamxatan 1962: 3). Dukhans do not call themselves Uyghur, as claimed in some publications. 3 The general view among scholars is that the Darkhat people are of Turkic origin and that their language and customs have become Mongol in the past few centuries. For a short survey of Darkhat grammatical features, see Sanžeev (1931) and Gáspár (2006). On Darkhat Mongolian’s substrate of Turkic features, see Ragagnin (2012b).



Sayan Turkic reindeer terminology 41
Below I shall alphabetically list and comment on Dukhan reindeer terminology,4 a
very unique part of Dukhan lexicon.5 The data is supported with materials from the
other neighbouring Taiga Sayan Turkic varieties:
(1) anhay ‘new-born reindeer calf’; cf. Toju-Tuvan aˁniy ‘reindeer calf’ (Čadamba
1974: 63), Tofan anhay ‘new-born reindeer calf’ (Rassadin 2014: 52) and Soyot
aˁnay ~ aˁnhay ‘reindeer calf up to year of age’ (Rassadin 2006: 22). Steppe Sayan
Turkic displays cognates referring to the young of other animals, e.g. Tuvan aˁnay
‘young offspring of a goat or mountain goat’ (Monguš 2003: 130b). Etymologically,
anhay is rather obscure. It could be traced back to Turkic ana ‘mother’ augmented
with the hypocoristic suffix -KAy, thus meaning ‘mommy’. Similar expressions are
used, for instance, in Turkish (see Ragagnin 2012a: 135–136 for details). For other
views, see Rassadin (2014: 54).
(2) bogana ~ mogana ‘male reindeer castrated at an advanced age’; cf. Tere-Khöl
Tuvan boxana ‘gelded reindeer’ (Kuular and Suvandi 2011a: 165); in Toju-Tuvan a
cognate of this term occurs in the compound bogana čarï denoting an older breeding
reindeer. Etymologically, bogana ~ mogana may represent a nominal formation
built with the Mongolic suffix -gAnA, used for names of plants and animals (Poppe
1954: 41), or a deverbal formation involving the Mongolic suffix -gAn (Poppe 1954:
45) or the corresponding denominal suffix -gAn deriving zoological and botanical
names in Old Turkic (Erdal 1991: 87). Moreover, bogana ~ mogana may be related
to Gagauz bobana ‘seven/eight-year-old sheep’ (Ščerbak 1961: 153). This claim,
however, needs further scrutiny.
(3) döŋhʉr ‘young reindeer buck’; cf. Toju Tuvan döˁnggür ‘without antlers, with
dropped antlers, one of the terms in use for a breeding reindeer’ (Čadamba 1974:
64), Tofan dönggür ‘male domesticated uncastrated ridable reindeer in its third year
and first mating season but not ready for mating’ (Harrison 2010: 57) and Soyot
döŋkir ‘reindeer buck’ (Rassadin 2006: 46). In Tuvan, the primary meaning of
döŋgür is ‘antlerless, bold’ (Tenišev 1968: 178a); also cf. Altay Turkic toŋkur
‘komolyj, bezxvostyj, obrezannyj, kucyj; derevo bez veršiny i vetvej’ (Verbickij
2005: 364). Also, see Tatarincev (2002: 235–236) and Monguš (2003: 495b) in this
4 Some Dukhan reindeer terms are listed in Badamxatan (1962: 9), Somfai-Kara (1998: 1819), Kuular and Suvandi (2011b) and Ragagnin (2010 and 2012a). 5 This scarcely documented special lexicon is rapidly getting lost. In my fieldwork sojourns, I could personally see how fuzzy it is among many Dukhans.

respect. It is a moot question whether this term may have originally been applied to
a young reindeer buck after its first (autumnal) antlers fell.
(4) ehsɨrɨk ‘new-born reindeer calf’; cf. Toju-Tuvan eˁzirik ‘affectionate name for
reindeer calf’ (Čadamba 1974: 63) and Soyot eˁsirik ‘new-born reindeer calf’
(Rassadin 2006: 85, 204). Steppe Sayan Turkic, on the other hand, displays
corresponding items referring to the young of other animals, cf. ezirik (eˁzirik)
‘goatling, (kid), fawn’ (Tenišev 1968: 608b, Dorlig and Dadar-ool 1994: 242a).
Etymologically, ehsɨrɨk is a transparent Turkic agent formed from the verbal stem
ehsɨr- ‘to get drunk’ (cf. ED 251: esür- ‘to be, or become, drunk, intoxicated) and
literally means ‘drunkard’. This denomination is most probably is based on the fact
that the new-born baby reindeer tumbles like a drunkard. Moreover, it likely belongs
to the set of taboo names applied to the young of both humans and animals in order
to protect them from evil spirits. It is quite unlikely that evil spirits would take away
a drunkard. In addition, from ehsɨrɨk the verbal stem ehsɨrɨkte- ‘to calf/to fowl’ is
formed.
(5) ehter ‘breeding reindeer’; cf. Toju Tuvan eˀder (Čadamba 1974: 63-64) and
Soyot eˀter ~ eˀtǝr (Rassadin 2006: 205) ‘reindeer buck’. Cognate forms are
documented in neighbouring Buryat Sayan dialects as well: eteer ‘breeding reindeer’
(Rassadin 1996: 149). Etymologically, ehter literally ‘screamer in rut’, is a Turkic
participial form derived from eht- ‘to scream in rut’ (cf. ED 39-40 and Röhrborn
2010: 200). Evidently, ‘screaming in rut’ is the most important characteristics of a
male reindeer on heat. Dukhan ehter also occurs in the expression ulɨγ ehter, literally
‘big ehter’ with reference to an “experienced” reindeer buck.
(6) guuday ‘castrated reindeer buck’; cf. Soyot quuday ‘domesticated three-year-old
reindeer buck’, Tere-Khöl Tuvan kuuday ‘small/young male reindeer (general term)’
(Seren 2006: 82) and Tofan kuuday ‘reindeer buck of about 2-3 years of age’
(Rassadin 1995: 33a). Ščerbak (1961: 91-92) and Tatarincev (2004: 327), derived
the term kuuday from Turkic kuu ‘grey’ and day ‘foal, young horse’.
(7) hokkaš ‘young reindeer up to one year of age’; cf. Tere-Khöl Tuvan xokaš
‘reindeer calf below one year of age’ (Seren 2006: 81), Tofan hokkaš ‘one-year-old
reindeer calf’ (Rassadin 1971: 190) and Soyot hoqaš ~ hokkaš ‘one-year-old
reindeer calf (in its second year)’ (Rassadin 2006: 85). Etymologically, hokkaš is
rather obscure. Arguably it goes back to the diminutive formation kuškaš ‘small
bird’ from kuš ‘bird’ through phonological distortion, not uncommon in taboo



Sayan Turkic reindeer terminology 43
names. Note in this respect that a structurally similar lexeme is documented in Sarig
Yugur gohqaš ‘small bird’ (Nugteren and Roos 2006: 110).
(8) hospayak ‘new-born reindeer fawn rejected by its own mother’; no cognates are
documented so far in the rest of Taiga Sayan Turkic. Morphologically, hospayak is a
nominal form derived from the verbal stem hos- ‘to refuse animal’s babies’.
Standard Tuvan employs the form xosturgan (xos- ‘to refuse animal babies’ +
causative + part) to characterize a young animal refused by its own mother, e.g.
xosturgan xuragan ‘rejected lamb’6.
(9) ǰarɨ ‘“calm” riding and packing reindeer older than four years of age’; cf. Tofan
ǰarǝ, Soyot čarï ‘riding and packing reindeer’ (Rassadin 1971: 194; 2006: 153),
Tere-Khöl and Toju Tuvan čarï ‘castrated reindeer’ (Seren 2006: 82). Interestingly,
Steppe Sayan Turkic varieties show a rather different picture. The standard Tuvan
cognate čarï refers to a breeding male reindeer (Tenišev 1968: 520a) and in the
Uyghur Uriankhay Sayan-Turkic variety of Eastern Khövsgöl ǰarɨ is the only
existing term meaning ‘reindeer’ (Ragagnin 2010: 142). Note, in this respect, that
Sayan western Buryat dialects, which show several Turkic features, displays the
cognate zari denoting both a gelded reindeer (older than 4 years of age) and a
(breeding) reindeer (Čeremisov 1973: 251b). Cognates of this term are quite
widespread in Siberia. Yeniseian terms such as for instance Yugh 4sɛh:r ‘reindeer’
and Ket sʼɛlʼ ‘reindeer’ may be related items (Werner 2002: 183); also see
Khabtagaeva (2015: 116). Historically, a cognate of ǰarɨ is documented in Rašīd-ud
Dīn’s Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh (Compendium of Chronicles). In section 107 dealing with
the “forest” Uriangqat tribe, the Ilkhanid Persian historian wrote: “They had no
cattle or sheep but raised and caught instead mountain oxen, mountain rams, and jür
(antelope), which is like a mountain sheep, which they milked and drank”
(Thackston 2012: 42, §107). Also see the information supplied by Marco Polo’s
13th century travelogue concerning reindeer herding nomads in the neighbouring
Bargu area (cf. Ragagnin 2015). Furthermore, Dukhan ǰarɨ occurs in the nominal
compound ehter-ǰarɨ which designates a breeding reindeer. Formal and semantic
cognates are well documented in other Taiga Sayan Turkic varieties, e.g. Tofan eˀter
ǰarï (Rassadin 1996: 149-150) and Soyot eˀter čarï (Rassadin 2006: 153). In these
6 I wish to thank my colleague Choduraa Tumat for providing me with this example.



44 Elisabetta Ragagnin
forms, ǰarɨ is clearly used as a species collective denomination.7 The compound
noun can thus be interpreted as ‘the category of rutting reindeer’.
(10) iβɨ general term referring to ‘reindeer’ (rangifer tarandus sibiricus); close
formal and semantic cognates are documented throughout Sayan Turkic, cf. Tofan
ibi ‘reindeer’ (Rassadin 1995: 24), Soyot ivi ‘id.’ (Rassadin 2006: 50), Tuvan ivi
‘id.’ (Tenišev 1968: 200). Etymologically, iβɨ is possibly related with iwiq ‘a she
antelope which frequents stony tracks and deserts’, recorded in Maḥmūd Al
Kāšγarī’s encyclopaedic work Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk (Compendium of the
languages of the Turks) and glossed with Arabic ẓabya (Dankoff and Kelly 1982:
108; also cf. Hauenschild 2003: 100).
(11) mïndɨ ‘fertile reindeer doe’; cf. Toju Tuvan mïndï ‘reindeer doe’ (Čadamba
1974: 63) and Soyot mïndï ‘adult reindeer doe; camel cow’ (Rassadin 2006: 93).8
Beyond Sayan Turkic, cognates of mïndɨ are widespread across north Asian
languages whose speakers are reindeer herders, see Tatár (1985) for examples.
Etymologically, mïndɨ most likely represents a loanword from Samoyedic; cf. Mator
méinde ‘rangifer ferus’. According to Helimski (1997: 301-302), Mator méinde may
be traced back to Proto-Samoyedic *məjan-ce̮ ɜ (məjan ‘ground [gen]’ + ce̮ ɜ ‘[tamed]
reindeer’). In Dukhan, the term mïndɨ also occurs in the following expressions: haš
(‘hairless’) mïndɨ ‘older reindeer doe with little fur’ gïsɨr (‘barren’) mïndɨ ‘dry doe’
and ulɨɣ mïndɨ ‘big/mature reindeer doe’.
(12) mïndɨǰak ‘reindeer doe that has fowled once’; cf. Tofan mïndïǰaq ‘two-year-old
reindeer doe’ (Rassadin 1995: 47b), Soyot mïndïǰaq ‘three-year-old reindeer doe’
(Rassadin 2006: 93) and Toju Tuvan mïndïčak ‘važenka dvux let’ (Čadamba 1974:
63). Etymologically, mïndɨǰak is a diminutive form of mïndɨ.
(13) öskʉsek ‘motherless fawn’; cognates of this Dukhan lexeme are not documented
in the rest of Taiga Sayan Turkic. Morphologically, öskʉsek represents a diminutive
formation from öskʉs ‘orphan’ (cf. ED 116–117: Old Turkic ögsüz ‘motherless’).
(14) bir düktǝɣ guuday9 ‘three-year-old castrated reindeer’ (one hair-der guuday).
Based on the same syntactic structure, i.e. cardinal number + dük ‘hair’ augmented
7 In this regard, also see Hauenschild (2003: 105–106). 8 Tofan, on the other hand, employs the term iŋgen (cf. ED 184: Old Turkic ingēn ‘female camel’) with reference to a reindeer doe. On the term ingēn, see also Hauenschild (2003: 94). 9 According to several Dukhan informants, bir düktǝɣ guuday is a synonym for düktǝɣ mĩĩs.



Sayan Turkic reindeer terminology 45
by the adjectivalizing suffix -LXɣ + guuday, ihx̃ɨ tüktǝɣ guuday and üš tüktǝɣ guuday
refer, respectively, to ‘two-haired guuday’ and ‘three-haired guuday’, i.e. ‘four-year
vs. five-year old gelded reindeer’. Cognates are documented in the other Taiga
Sayan Turkic varieties: Tere-Khöl Tuvan iyi tüktüg kuuday ‘three-year-old male
reindeer’, üš tüktüg kuuday ‘four-year-old male reindeer’ and Toju Tuvan bir düktüg
mïyïs ‘male reindeer of about 3 years of age’, iyi düktüg mïyïs ‘male reindeer of
about four years of age’, üš düktüg mïyïs ‘male reindeer of about five years of age’
(Seren 2006: 82).
(15) sããrsǝk mĩĩs ‘reindeer with one dropped antler’ (sããrsǝk ‘one of two’ and mĩĩs
‘antler’).
(16) dasfanaŋ ‘wild, i.e. not tamed reindeer’. Among Taiga Sayan Turkic varieties
merely Soyot displays the formally and semantically close cognate daspanaŋ ‘wild
reindeer’ (Rassadin 2006: 43). The term dasfanaŋ possibly goes back to taspan (see
below) and aŋ ‘wild animal’.
(17) daspan ‘one-year-old young reindeer’; cf. Toju Tuvan daspan ‘one-year-old
reindeer’ (Sat 1987: 77), Tofan daspan ‘two-year-old young wild reindeer’
(Rassadin 1995: 21a). The etymology of daspan is obscure; for some proposals, see
Tatarincev (2002: 105–106).
(18) doŋgʉr ‘approximately 18-month-old male reindeer’; cf. Tere-Khöl Tuvan
toŋgur/tuŋxur ‘approximately two-year-old male reindeer’ (Kuular and Suvandi
2011a: 165), Toju Tuvan dongur ‘approximately one-year-old young reindeer’ and
Soyot doŋγur ~ doŋγïr ‘two-year-old reindeer buck’ (Rassadin 2006: 45).
Etymologically, doŋgʉr might be traced back to a rhotacised form of Turkic toŋuz
‘pig’. This assumption, however, needs further investigation. In this respect, it
should be kept in mind that names of strong and dangerous animals, such as the
boar, belong to the set of taboo names in use across Siberia and neighbouring areas.
(19) doŋgʉy ‘approximately 18-month-old reindeer doe’; cf. Tere-Khöl Tuvan
tuŋxuy ~ tuŋguy ‘approximately two-year-old reindeer doe’ (Kuular and Suvandi
2011a: 165). Further formal cognates of doŋgʉy are Mator toŋoi ‘pig’ (Helimski
1997: 365, §1060), Toju Tuvan doŋay ‘two-year-old wild reindeer’ and Tuvan
doŋay (Monguš 2003: 474a) ‘bear cub’. Etymologically, doŋgʉy may also ultimately
go back to a rhotacised form of Turkic toŋuz. Note that in this regard that Helimski
(1997: 365, §1060) traced Mator toŋoi ‘pig’ back to Proto-Turkic *doŋur. Further
Dukhan expressions including the term doŋgʉy are ǰaš doŋgʉy, literally ‘young



46 Elisabetta Ragagnin
doŋgʉy’, referring to a young doe about to foal, and hur doŋgʉy, literally ‘last year’s
doŋgʉy’ employed for a reindeer doe that has foaled twice.
(20) düktǝɣ mĩĩs ‘three-year-old castrated reindeer’; cf. Soyot düktɨγ miis
‘domesticated young reindeer buck in its third year of age’ (Rassadin 2006: 47). The
expression düktǝɣ mĩĩs literary means ‘hairy antler’.
(21) uzǝn but literally ‘long leg’; this term specifically refers to a reindeer buck that
will be castrated in the autumn, at least according to some informants; cf. Soyot
uzïn-but ‘young reindeer buck in its third year of age’ (Rassadin 2006: 139).
3. Transcription and abbreviations
The transcription employed here follows general principles employed in Turcology,
with the following additions: the symbols ɨ and ʉ represent the high central vowels
occurring beyond first syllables, and the super-script h designates preaspiration of
fortis consonants, corresponding to Tuvan and Tofan glottalization/
pharyngealization, marked here with the symbol ˀ. Abbreviations occurring in the
grammatical glosses are: CAUS: causative, DER: derivation, and PART: participle.
