FOREWORD
In this volume, Egyptian words beginning with m- are examined from an etymological standpoint. Collecting external (Afro-Asiatic) parallels for m-words started back in 1994 (with pauses), while additional Egyptian lexicographical data for m- were gathered in summer 2002 and since 2004. A preliminary draft of the m-section of the lexicon was completed in March 1998. The research for volume three was interrupted between 2001 and March 2004, when work on the comparative dictionary of the Angas-Sura languages (Takács 2004) was carried out. Then, during two years of intense "ling from March 2004 to June 2006, the Egyptian etymological word catalogue (ongoing in Székesfehérvár since 2004) was enriched with the materials that have accrued in recent years. As a result, the new – signi"cantly enlarged and revised – manuscript of the present volume was prepared during the summer and autumn of 2000 and from June 2006 to August 2007.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I am grateful to a number of colleagues for their precious communications on etymological matters. Naturally, any shortcomings of EDE III are solely my responsibility. The most outstanding assistance in Egyptian lexicography since 2004 has been provided for me by Hofrat Prof. H. Satzinger (Institut für Ägyptologie, Wien), whom I cannot thank enough for his moral correctness as well as for his divine patience and readiness to provide any detail at any time over the past three years. Warm thanks are due to Prof. D. Meeks (Aix-en-Provence and Cairo) for his innumerable comments on rare Egyptian words between 2000 and 2004 as well as for providing me with several inaccessible publications. I am greatly indebted also to Drs. O. Witthuhn (Seminar für Ägyptologie, Marburg an der Lahn) for his unsel"sh help throughout 2006 with unavailable Egyptological literature. As for questions of Semitic etymology, I have had the privilege of being guided by Prof. R. M. Voigt (Freie Universität, Berlin). I am indebted also to Dr. W. G. E. Watson (Newcastle upon Tyne), Dr. A. Måacelaru (Bucure!ti and Riyadh) and Dr. L. Kogan (RGGU: Russian State University of the Humanities, Moscow) for their occasional communications. In Berber linguistics, my heartfelt thanks go to Prof. K.-G. Prasse (Værløse, formerly København) and Dr. M. Kossmann (Leiden), whose constant professional guidance throughout 2006–2007 has helped me to avoid several mistakes. My thanks are due to Dr. C. Taine-Cheikh (Paris) for her help with the Zenaga (West Berber) material. On issues of Cushitic etymology, I have consulted Prof. D. Appleyard (SOAS, London, for Agaw and EthioSemitic), Prof. G. Banti (for Lowland East Cushitic) and Prof. M. Tosco (for Dahalo, both from the Istituto Universitario Orientale, Dipartimento di Studi e Richerche su Africa et Paesi Arabi, Napoli), Prof. Ch. Ehret (UCLA, Dept. of History, Los Angeles, for South Cushitic), Prof. H.-J. Sasse (Universität zu Köln, Institut für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, for East Cushitic), and Dr. M. Vanhove (CNRS-LLACAN, Villejuif, Paris, for Beja). Questions of Omotic lexicon and linguistics have been discussed with Prof. Emer. M. L. Bender (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale). For his invaluable support and help in Chadic linguistics over the past ten years, I wish to express my utmost gratitude to Prof. H. Jungraithmayr (Institut für Afrikanische Sprachwissenschaften, J. W.

Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main). Certain details of Hausa and Chadic linguistics were clari"ed to me by Prof. P. Newman (Indiana University, Dept. of Linguistics, Bloomington) and Prof. H. Tourneux (LLACAN, CNRS, Villejuif, Paris), respectively. I had the privilege to discuss some relevant questions of Indo-European linguistics with Prof. J. Puhvel (Encino, California). Those facilitating and unsel"shly assisting the success of my numerous research fellowships in the period of preparing this volume deserve due acknowledgement. During my stay at the Institut für Afrikanische Sprachwissenschaften ( J. W. Goethe-Universität) in Frankfurt am Main (April–August 2002 and May 2005), which was sponsored by the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (Bonn), I have been assisted considerably by the accomodating and truly helpful staff of the “Orientalistik, Judaistik, Afrikanistik” Department of the Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek. I managed to greatly enrich my Berber lexical materials signi"cantly thanks to my visit to the Fonds Roux in May–June 2002 (IREMAM: Institut de Recherches et d’Études sur le Monde Arabe et Musulman, Aix-en-Provence), where I received invaluable help from Mme C. Brenier-Estrine, the charming librarian of this Berberological collection. I am highly grateful to Dr. M. Arbach (Aix-en-Provence, now at CEFAS: Centre Français d’Archéologie et de Sciences de Sanaa, Sanaa, Yemen) for his generous permission to use his extensive specialist library in Semitics in Aix. Mrs and Mr Scherp (Frankfurt am Main) deserve my heartfelt thanks for their friendly help with transporting my scholarly materials from Aix to Frankfurt. My research at the Oriental Library of Leiden University (April 2003) has also brought considerable results. Most fruitful and pleasant were my unforgettable stays (supported by the Hungarian National Scienti"c Research Fund) at the Ägyptisch-Orientalische Sammlung of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Wien ( June and then October –November 2004, June–September 2007) thanks to the exceptional assistance and generosity – that I cannot suf"ciently appreciate – of the charming staff of the Sammlung: "rst of all to Hofrat Dr. E. Haslauer (by whose rare self-sacri"cing kindness I am still moved) as well as to Dr. R. Hölzl, Dr. M. Hüttner, Mrs G. Döbbelin, Mrs R. Egner, Mrs M. Gregor, and Mrs B. Poropatisch. I am indebted also to Prof. Holaubek as well as to Mag. I. Kaplan and Miss M. Buhl for facilitating my fruitful research at the Institut für Ägyptologie, Universität Wien. I wish to express my sincere thanks to the DAAD (Deutsche Akademische Austauschdienst) for granting me a fellowship for my research in Berlin in August–September 2004, during which I was

able to consult the old "les and the library of the research project “Altägyptisches Wörterbuch” at the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (thanks are due to Dr. I. Hafemann and Dr. Topmann for their assistance) as well as the library of the Institut für Semitistik und Arabistik der Freien Universität (upon the kind invitation of Prof. R. M. Voigt). Last, but not least, it is with deep gratitude that I mention my brief visit at the Seminar für Ägyptologie in Marburg an der Lahn in early May 2006, where, in spite of its brevity, I was able to collect signi"cant additional materials on Egyptian lexicography thanks to the assistance of Drs. O. Witthuhn. I have received many otherwise inaccessible publications and much data over the past "ve years from countless colleagues. It is impossible to list all of them. In 2007, outstanding help was provided by Hofrat Dr. E. Haslauer (Ägyptisch-Orientalische Sammlung of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Wien), Drs. H. Kovács (library of the Oriental Institute of Chicago), Hofrat Prof. H. Satzinger (Institut für Ägyptologie, Wien), and Prof. R. M. Voigt (Institut für Semitistik und Arabistik der Freien Universität, Berlin). I also wish to thank (in alphabetical order) Prof. Kh. Alio (N’Djamena), Prof. Emer. M. L. Bender (Carbondale, Illinois), Dr. R. M. Blench (Cambridge, London), Prof. B. Caron (CNRS-LLACAN, Villejuif, Paris), Dr. R. Cosper (Linguistics Program, Dept. of Sociology, Saint Mary’s University, Hailfax), Prof. M. Dziekan (Oriental Institute, Warsaw University), Miss C. Geisenheyner (Institut für Afrikanistik, Hamburg) for sending me rare and older sources on Angas-Sura, Prof. R. Hannig (Seminar für Ägyptologie, Marburg an der Lahn) for sending me the volumes of his magni"cent Ägyptisches Wörterbuch (ÄWb I–II), Prof J. Huehnergard (Harvard University), Prof. R. Keißling (Institut für Afrikanistik, Hamburg), Prof. U. Luft (ELTE, Hungary), Dr. G. Savà (Dept. of African Languages and Linguistics, Leiden), Prof. R. G. Schuh (Dept. of Linguistics, UCLA, Los Angeles), Dr. R. Sottile (Università di Napoli “L’Orientale”), Prof. H. Tawil (Yeshiva University College, New York), and Dr. W. G. E. Watson (Newcastle upon Tyne). I am deeply indebted to several persons and organisations for their generous help in very many technical matters, especially to the staff of the former ARÉV Printing Works (Székesfehérvár): "rst of all, Mrs Anna Huber for her scrupulous work over the past "fteen years (since 1992) that I greatly appreciate, Mrs Júlia Rácz and Mr L. Bárdosi for their friendliness. My sincere thanks go also to Mr A. Szilágyi (formerly Raszter Print Nyomda, now BriBen Nyomda Kft., both in

Székesfehérvár), Mr Á. Reiter and Mr B. Luttor (Printer Nyomda, Székesfehérvár) for their generosity as well as to the pleasant and friendly teams of the copy-shops in the Adalbertstraße in Frankfurt a/M (KopieCorner) as well as in the Dorotheenstraße in Berlin (TAT-Triumph Ost GmbH). Over the past "ve years (August 2002, September and November 2004, May 2005, June 2007), my father, Mr J. Takács, has given me outstanding and invaluable technical help with transporting hundreds of kilogrammes of scholarly materials from abroad back to Székesfehérvár. Special thanks are due to Drs. E. Tóth (Institute of Linguistics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences) for her unsel"sh technical help over the past three years and especially for creating the pdf version of my manuscript. I am indebted to Prof. E. Gaál (1941–2005), my revered old teacher and to Dr. T. Bács (both at ELTE, Hungary) as well as to Prof. I. Kenesei and Prof. R. Simon (Institute of Linguistics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences) who have allowed me a #exible timetable in both my positions since 2003, facilitating a maximal exploitation of time. The wonderful conversation with Prof. Kenesei on 13 May 2003 remains unforgettable. I thank Mrs Alice Csoba and Mrs Judit Tiba (ELTE, Hungary) as well as Mrs Mária Kovács and Mrs Anikó Ferenczi (Institute of Linguistics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences) for their care and friendly interest. It is here that I wish to acknowledge with gratitude the diligent assistance of Miss Terézia Horváth and Mrs Szilvia Muhr (ELTE, Hungary) over the past "ve years in countless practical matters. I am glad to acknowledge the support given by a number of foundations to my various projects, which helped me to "nance my scholarly work at different stages over the past "ve years: Lánczos-Szekf,/" Foundation (City Hall, Székesfehérvár), Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (Bonn), OTKA (Országos Tudományos Kutatási Alap, National Scienti"c Research Fund, Hungary), Deák Ferenc fellowship granted by the Hungarian Ministry of Education (Oktatási Minisztérium), Talentum Prize (Hungary). It is here that I wish to thank to Mrs Armène Vycichl (Genève), this wonderful lady, for her vivid attention and generous support. Over the past "ve adventurous years, I could not have overcome the dif"culties that arose without the constant and implicit moral support of my four elder friends, four outstanding "gures of Afro-Asiatic comparative linguistics of our time (in alphabetical order), namely Prof. Emer. M. L. Bender (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), Prof. A. B. Dolgopolsky (University of Haifa), Prof. H. Jungraithmayr (Insti

tut für Afrikanische Sprachwissenschaften, J. W. Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt a/M), and Prof. A. Zaborski ( Jagellonian University and Institute of Oriental Philology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków). I hold their trust and friendship in high esteem. I wish to express my gratitude for the enthusiastic attention and encouragement of Drs. M. I. Sokolova (Moscow), Dr. C. Taine-Cheikh (Paris and Nouakchott, Mauritanie), Dr. A. Boucherit (Sorbonne, Paris), and Prof. A. Lonnet (GLECS: Groupe Linguistique d’Études Chamito-Sémitiques, Paris) as well as my colleagues in the Oriental Research Group at the Institute of Linguistics (Hungarian Academy of Sciences). I thank Prof. R. Hannig (Seminar für Ägyptologie, Marburg an der Lahn) for both of our lengthy conversations (May 2005 and May 2006), which provided precious background information. I was honoured by the warm Sicilian affection and hospitality of Mr P. Galfo and Mr G. Scrofani as well as other friends from Via degli Normanni during my stay in Ragusa-Ibla ( June 2005). Most recently, my short visits to Balaton in 2006–2007 and to Martinique in June 2007 (my cordial thanks go to Mme F. Péaud and Dr. A. Anselin for their friendliness) helped me to recuperate from a heavy schedule over the past half decade, and so have signi"cantly facilitated the completion of this volume as planned. I am grateful to Michael Mozina (E. J. Brill, Boston) for all of his hard work with volume three. Special ackowledgement is due to Patricia Radder (E. J. Brill, Leiden) for her ef"cient editorial work on both previous volumes of this dictionary and for her exceptionally friendly attitude. My special thanks go to Dr. W. G. E. Watson (Newcastle upon Tyne), who was kind and unsel"sh enough to take out the necessary time from his many-sided commitments in order to check the English of the introductory paragraphs. This volume is dedicated to the memory of Acad. J. Harmatta (1917–2004), my former teacher, and it is here that I wish to commemorate Mr. Eduárd Káldor (1921–2006), the dear old friend, who had always shown true interest in my work. !çh kwrb.






INTRODUCTION
The aims and principles of this etymological dictionary remain, as outlined in EDE II xiii–xviii. The structure of etymological entries is also unchanged. Two important aspects have, however, gained more emphasis than before in the light of my experience with EDE II. On the one hand, Semitic loan-words are from now discussed in full without exception (unless there is absolutely no suggestion for an etymology), since there are often diverse (sometimes equally unconvincing) etymologies suggested for the same Ramesside form, and a critical discussion and appraisal of the competing views is desirable. In other words, the standard works dealing with this segment of the Egyptian lexical stock (Helck 1962, 1971; SCR 1992; Hoch 1994) are unfortunately not as reliable as it seemed to me a decade earlier when EDE II was prepared. On the other hand, as I declared right in the beginning (cf. EDE I ix), EDE is merely an etymological compendium presenting and analyzing the Afro-Asiatic parallels to the Eg. roots and by no means a dictionary examining “. . . .the philological and textual background of the discussed Egyptian roots”, since “my work does not and was not intended to serve such purposes”. Nevertheless, I partly revised this reluctant position, in spite of seeing the controversies of Egyptian lexicographical research (including the diverse trends of vowel reconstruction). Accordingly, from 2002 on, the primary and secondary literatures of Egyptian philology have also been "led in my Egyptain etymological word catalogue (EEWC) ohne Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit, although I still maintain that this kind of analysis (demanding double amounts of efforts and time) should be basically the task of another project even if our standard dictionaries of Egyptian are evidently imperfect. Whether the extra efforts invested in securing this additional aspect of the etymological analysis will essentially contribute to the fundamental aim of EDE (cf. vol. I ix) and will be thus ultimately compensated by a corresponding scienti"c pro"t, has to be decided by the reader. Unfortunately, the etymological investigation of Egyptian has recently been disturbed by the reappearance of certain alarming negative tendencies in#uencing even some leading authorities of Egyptian linguistics. These are either a distorted interpretation of the so-called Wurzelprinzip

or a far-fetched application of the Rössler theory, which has otherwise given us a number of brilliant observations (for a critical survey and analysis of these phenomena cf. Takács 2003, 59ff.; 2005, 14ff.; 2005, 207–211; 2005, 623ff.). It is hoped that – as in more fortunate areas of comparative-historical linguistics, such as Semitic or Indo-European, where similar teething problems have already been successfully eliminated (e.g., Kogan 2003) – these dif"culties of Egyptian linguistics will be also overcome.

!"
*m . . . “(a species of ) owl”, to be reconstructed on the basis of the hrgl. with the phonetic value m depicting an owl specimen: “Eule” (Wb II 1, 1) = “eagle owl (Bubo ascalaphus)” (EG1 27, 460, G17) = “barn owl (Tyto alba alba)” (Newberry 1951, 72 reaf"rmed recently also by Houlihan 1986, 108–110, #56) = “plusieurs espèces de la famille des strigides” (Vycichl 1990, 55).
nb: For further discussion of the hrgl. cf. also Grif"th 1898, 20; BIFAO 43 (1945),
71; Keimer 1951; Newberry 1951, 72–74; Fischer 1983, 10–11. Newberry (1951,
72) debated Grif"th’s de"nition of the hrgl. (“varies but is not long-eared until very late
times”) and maintains that “the type invariably employed in the Protodynastic period is the
Eagle Owl and this bird occurs sporadically from Dynasty III throughout dynastic times” and
that “from Dynasty III the common type for the hrgl. m is the barn owl. Newberry
(1951, 72, fn. 2) equally disputed the opinion of Cottevieille-Giraudet (that the
prototype of the hrgl. m was the small owl, which is, however, round-headed and
did not appear before Dyn. XXVI) as well as that of Gardiner (since eagle owl
has no ears). Shaheen (1996, 77) holds the “horned” form of the hrgl. m to be the
earliest hieratic shape of the sign (he examined also the OK inscription evidence
for the “horned” m).
! We know only the "rst radical with certainty, the rest of the word is still debated. " 1. In Egyptology (cf. e.g. Müller 1899, 259; Sethe 1912, 92; 1916, 153; Wb I 1; Ember 1930, 61; Newberry 1951 with further lit.; CED 82; Vcl. 1990, 55), the hrgl. m is usually explained on the basis of acrophony from Cpt.: (O) *emoulj (KHW) = e[moulaj] (Spg. KHW), (S) (Ha)moulaHj, (B) moula(H)j “night raven” (CD 165–6, cf. xix) = “"#$%&$'()*” (Champollion, cf. Newberry 1951, 73) = “owl” (CED 82, for vars. see Smith 1975, 198f.; 1978, 360) = “night raven” (CD 166b) = “Nachteule” (Spg. KHW 59 & fn. 7; OLZ 35, 254; KHW 92), which occurs also in Dem. as 3mwl3 “Nachteule” (DG 5, dem. mag. pap. of London & Leiden 24:31, 27:9, 3rd cent. AD, cf. Grif"th & Thompson 1908, 24, 31) = «mwl3 (so, «-!) “eagle
owl” (Newberry l.c.). The hypothetic PEg. *mwl3 [ perhaps irreg. < *mwl2?] could be perhaps identical with Bed. miláike (f ) “owl” [Rpr. 1928, 216; absent in Rn. 1895] !! LECu.: perhaps Afar milliko (f ) “bird of prey (= osprey, Pandion halinitus?)” [PH 1985, 168] !!! ECh.: WDng. múrkúkù [-rk- perhaps < *-lk-] “chouette” [Fédry 1971, 139], which all would lead to assuming AA *m-l-k “owl” [GT], whose *-k would, however, be irregular in comparison with Dem. -3 < PEg. *-g.



lit.: the Bed.-Eg. comparison was observed independently by V. Bla&ek (2000 MS, 21
on Beja fauna; 2003, 266: Bed.-Eg.-Afar) and G. Takács (EEWC: Eg.-Bed.-WDng.).
nb1: The origin of the Dem.-Cpt. word is obscure. The above listed Cu.-ECh. paral
lels speak for an inherited tricons. AA etymon. In Egyptian philology, in turn, the
Dem.-Cpt. word has been usually analyzed as a compound of *mou- and *-laj
in various unconvincing ways. W. M. Müller (1899, 259–260) was unable to identify
either parts of his “Kompositum” mw + l) (?), and rightly added that “doch ist es sehr
unsicher”. The identi"cation of both components is disputed. K. Sethe (1912, 92)
identi"ed the second component of Cpt.: (S) moulaHj, (B) moulaj with Cpt.:
(B) *lwji “to hide”, (S) qual. lhj+ “to be hidden” (KHW 83), and translated Cpt.
*mou-laj as “die im Verborgenen lebende Eule”. Newberry (1951, 73) rightly
criticized Sethe giving mou (sic) “Eule” as a word of its own (without query-mark),
which does not exist. A. Ember (1930, 61) suggested that the Cpt. element *mou
was onomatopoetic. J. ,erný (CED 82, 226) and W. Westendorf (KHW 92), in turn,
equated Cpt. *mou- with the element *-mau of (S) kakka-mau, (B) cakka-mau
“small night owl, kleine Nachteule”, in which *kakka- is supposedly related to (S)
kouk “a bird” ~ Ar. q$q- “small owl” (KHW 59). Kaplony (cited in KHW 92)
sees in the "rst component OEg. m33 “to see” (!).
nb2: Smith (1975, 198–200, §3) suggests a fully different etymology for Cpt. (S)
HamoulaHj (hapax, Pierpont Morgan MS 51:35, considered in CD as var. (B)
moulaj), cf. Dem. %mr ~ %m3r (associated with ghosts, dead men, monsters,
monsters, demons and other noxions, Sethian creatures who might af#ict the living
with death or disease, thought to arrive upon the death of a man and to carry his
soul off to the underworld). Rejecting its comparison with (SB) Hrim “pelican” (sug
gested by Thompson), he sided with a derivation of (S) HamoulaHj, (B) moula(H)j
from *%m3r-%3 “destroying owl”, cf. (SF) Hwj “to be in straits (of death)” > Haj
“some sort of plague which pursues the dying man like strong wind and devouring
"re” (cf. CD 742b), whereby Dem. %m3r > *Hamoul. Alternatively, Smith proposes
(“less plausibly”) a connection with late NK %mrq (GW, name of a demon, mag. Pap.
Leiden 343, 3:9 & 6:4, cf. Wb III 96, 6).
nb3: The initial Dem. 3- (claimed by Hodge 1990, 168 to be “unexplained”) was
treated by Edel (1963, 99–101) as a re#ex of an older j-.
" 2. N. Skinner (1996, 204) suggested another explanation with acrophony, comparing WCh.: Hausa múú‰ììyáá “owl” [Abr. 1962, 682], Gwandara mú‰ìya “owl” [ Mts. 1972, 83]. Cp. perhaps also CCh.: Daba mimbi&imbi&im “hibou” [ Mch. 1966, 136]. Improbable with regard to #1.
nb1: O. V. Stolbova (1987, 77; 1996, 112) thinks that Hausa -‰i- can derive from
WCh. *-‰- (= OEg. -z-). If the suggested Hausa-Eg. etymology nevertheless proves
correct, we have to postulate OEg. *mz (or sim.) “owl”.
nb2: Skinner (l.c.) mistakenly combined the Hausa form with Eg. mš« “ein Vogel”
(Med., Wb II 156, 17).
" 3. There are further ways of explaining the hrgl. m by acrophony (of which #3.1. appears especially tempting).
nb: Cp. (1) CCh.: Mada máwwá “hibou sp.”, but cf. wáwwá “hibou” [Brt. & Brunet
2000, 195], which would "t very well Sethe’s (1916, 153) hypothetic *mou “owl”.
(2) NBrb.: Zayan & Sgugu muka “chouette” [Lbg. 1924, 569] !!! ECh.: Lele mígí
“un oiseau: rapace nocturne” [ WP 1982, 62]. (3) SBrb.: Ayr m-ttyoyy-n “esp.
d’oiseau (ressemble au hibou)” [PAM 1998, 228].
" 4. The value of Eg. m has hardly anything to do with Sem. *b$m“owl” [ DRS 52, #2] as seemingly maintained by C. T. Hodge (1990, 168), who attached here also Lat. b$b. from a common AA-IE “proto-base” beginning with *b-.
2 *m



" 5. E. Edel (1963, 95, 99–101), followed by W. Vycichl (1983, 112), W. Westendorf (LÄ VI 588), W. Schenkel (LÄ V 716), and Th. Schneider (1997, 252), explained the hrgl. value m from an unattested *jm. w (Edel), which they identi"ed (as defective wtg.) with the word m (Weltkammer). Thus they tried to link the hrgl. m to LEg. jm “Name eines Vogels” (XXII., Festival-Hall of Osorkon II, Wb I 78, 5) = “entenähnlicher Vogel” (Edel 1963, 99), for which they suppose an onomatopoetic origin < jm “wehklagen, jammern” (Wb I 77, 12), arguing that it was act. “Jammervogel” (Edel), since “hibou est prob. l’oiseau qui émit des sons plaintifs” (Vcl. l.c. referring to semantical parallels in IE), because of “das unheimliche, klagende ‘Uhu’ dieses Nachtvogels” and “der Ruf der Athene noctua glanx, einer der drei Eulenarten, die nach Newberry . . . in der Spätzeit das Schriftbild des m bestimmt” (Edel), “the call being a plaintive ‘kew-kew’ ” (Newberry 1951, 1951, 72). Edel saw the “vermutliche Grundform” of Cpt. st.cstr. (e)mou- vs. st.abs. *emoou (*/m!w) “Eule” (sic) in OK *jm.w (*j'måw, accepted by Schenkel l.c.) “der Klagende, der jammernde (Vogel)”, a nomen agentis formed with -w (cf. AÄG §225–232). Unconvincing. Declined already by H. S. Smith (1978, 199, fn. 6). " 6. P. Kaplony (IÄF 388) explains the hrgl. *m “owl” from a *m(3) “der Sehende (Vogel)”, since “besonders deutlich gezeichnet sind die Augen der Eule an der Städtepalette” (so!). Weak.
m “1. in, 2. mit, 3. als” (OK, Wb II 1–2) = “1. in, 2. with, by means of, together with, 3. from, out of, 4. as, namely (m of predication), 5. (before suff. conj.) when, as, though etc.” (FD 99; cf. Grd. 1927, §162) " adv. jm “da, dort, dorthin” (OK, Wb I 72) = “there(in), therewith, therefrom” (FD 17).
nb1: Vocalized as *ma (MBab., Amarna) vs. *me (NAss., 7th cent. BC) acc. to the
cuneiform evidence re#ecting Eg. personal names (KMAV 50; Czermak 1934, II,
196; Edel 1948, 15, §VIII; 1954, 38; 1980, 16, 20, 37f.). Thus, Fecht (1960, 40, §72)
and Osing (1979, 313) reconstructed it as *ma- in st. nom. Edel (1948, 15) set up
*jm-= and Fecht (1960, 189, §392) *( j()ma= in st. pron. Note, however, that Vergote
(1962, 74) segmented the pre"x in the underlying cuneiform personal names only as
-m- (leaving the subsequent vowel for the following noun), e.g. MBab. Pa-ria-m-a0$
< p3-r«-m-%3.t, NAss. Manti-m-e01 < mn2w-m-%3.t. The latter PN is attested in a
cryptographic form (seated Month holding a sail) read mn2w-m%j.t (as suggested by
Spg. in ZÄS 65, 1930, 131 and corroborated by Smither 1939, 168, fn. 1), which,
however, suggests -em-, cf. (L) !Hh (note that Drioton 1943, 177–8 proposed an
alternative cryptographic reading mn2w-m-%t3w).
nb2: The bilabial articulation of the pre"x shifted to a dental one by the NK
(sporadically, acc. to Czermak, only in a “weak syllable”, but acc. to Böhlig “sehr
m3



häu!g”), which yielded (SALBF) N- prep. of diverse functions, i.a. nota accusativi
(Erman NÄG 1933, §603, §606; Czermak 1934, II, 196–7; Fecht 1960, 40, §72;
Böhlig 1977, 17–23; Osing 1979, 313). For a detailed discussion of the acc. marker
usage of LEg. m > N-, !mo= v. Spg. 1904, 34–35, §XII. Similary, the “intrusive”
m- of the LEg. indep. prons. seems also relevant to this LEg. phonetic shift m > n.
Albeit Erman (NÄG 1933, §98) assumed m- to indicate that n- was not lost (NB:
this could have been achieved rather by the doubling of nn-) as in the rel. pron. ntj
> et, while ,erný & Groll (1978, 5) explained it via assimil. of [m]/[n] before -t-,
S. Uljas (2005, 87–90) has now demonstrated that m- in mntk etc. was a relict of
an old jn (in the construction jn + nomen), which is explainable by an [ jn] value
of m, which was also functionally assimilated to jn. Similarly, Dem. jn-jw > of (S)
nhu (stative of jw “to come”, which in Dem. it refers to a progress, not a state) is
usually explained from MEg. m-jj.t “in coming” (so most recently e.g. L. Depuydt
1998, 63 noting that qualitatives with jn- always indicate progressive actions just
as MEg. m + inf.).
nb3: For a new use of m “together with” (with exx. from OK, MK, LEg.) see
Smither 1939, 166–9, also EG3 §162.7a. For its additive meaning see Gdk. 1967
(KDAR), 46.
! Not excluded that behind the many-sided functions of Eg. m we have to suspect three (unrelated?) AA morphemes: (1) “in, from” vs. (2) “with” vs. (3) “as, like”. Thus, (1) Eg. m with locative function may be ~ Sem.: perhaps Geez "2m
“from, out of (place) etc.” [Lsl. 1987, 22] and Gafat 2mmä ~ mä “à, dans (lieu, temps), de” [Lsl. 1956, 176] !!! Agaw: Kemant -—3 [reg. < *m3] (postp.) “dans” [CR 1912, 239] !!! NOm.: Benesho -m ~ -n “on, at, in” [ Wdk. 1990, 115] !!! WCh.: Fyer "m ~ m “nach, zu,
an, in” [ Jng. 1970, 87] ! Kupto -m-/-m “in”, cf. mà “von” [Leger 1992, 20, 27] !! CCh.: Glavda mà ~ má “in, from, within, out of ” [RB 1968, 61], Mnd. Öm (preverb) “hinein, herein” [ Wolff 1974, 19], Dghwede me “in, into, apart” [Frick 1976, 8] !! ECh.: Mkl. "úmméy ~ "úmmèy “là, là-bas, voilà” [ Jng. 1990, 190] ! Mubi má
“1. her von, 2. beim Komparativ, 3. und” [Lks. 1937, 184] < AA *m “in” [GT]. Here might belong the Akk. adv. case ending -um (Djk.: -m here was not the mimation) which I. M. Diakonoff (1988, 61) took from AA *-Vm “locatativus-adverbialis”.
nb: The Eth.-Sem. parallels are problematic. These were derived by W. Leslau
(1945, 161) from Eth.-Sem. *2mnä ~ *2m “from”. The origin of the Gafat prep. is
dubious. Leslau (1956, 213) proposed two alternatives: (1) < )mn in the sense “de”
(i.e., < Sem. *min) with the loss of *-n just as in the case of e.g. S’a«dah (Yemen)
m1 “von” [Behnstedt 1987, 305], (2) perhaps a “variante phonétique” of Gafat bä
in the sense “dans”.
(2) Eg. m “with " by means of ” ~ Om.: cf. perhaps Ongota (if it belongs with Om.) -mi ~ -me “by (means of ), with (noun suf"x, agentive or instrumental)” [Flm. 1992, 212] !!!

AP: L. Homburger (1929, 168; 1930, 283) compares Eg. m with various Afr. words
like Bantu (sic) mu “dans”, Mande ma “dans”, Peul ma- (pre"x of possessive pro
nouns). Similarly, Th. Obenga (1993, 291, #19) suggests that Eg. m = Bantu (sic)
mu ~ omu “dans, au moyen de, hors de, ainsi, précisément”, Mbochi m- (mo, ma,
m’) “id.”, LECu.: Oromo mo “aussi” (!), Ngambay m1 “dans”. A certain part of
all these forms (“aussi”) is surely irrelevant.

! To the best of my knowledge, there are no unambiguous cognates in Sem. despite the various attempts to "nd a Sem. etymology. There are also other unacceptable suggestions. Note: " 1. For phonological reasons, Eg. m cannot be related to Sem. *b(prep.) “in, from” as supposed by many scholars. Rejected already by W. Vycichl (DELC 134–5). This misleading similarity was correctly formulated already by J.-J. Clère (1945–8, 25), who pointed to that the identical meanings of Eg. m vs. Ar. bi- are due to “l’évolution simplement parallèle, sans liens historiques”.

nb1: Eg. m vs. Sem. *b are irregular and nothing seems to justify a secondary
change of *b " m or vice versa.
nb2: For Sem. *b- cf. also OEg. bw “place” (above).
" 2. H. Möller (1911, 66) combined a whole range of unrelated terms: Eg. ( j)m “in(ter)”, mt.t “Mitte”, mtr.t “Mittag” ~ Sem. *matn“Hüfte” (Möller: < *”Mitte”!) ~ Gk. *+%) < IE *(e)m-/*À- + ext. *-t- as well as with IE *médh-Êo-s (with ext. *-dh-) “medius” (sic). Unacceptable. " 3. F. Behnk (1927, 81, #11) and A. Ember (1930, #10.b.14), followed by V. Bla&ek (2004, 5), equated Eg. m mistakenly with Sem.: Akk. ema “in”. But the Akk. form is correctly 1m ~ 1ma, which is a compound of ai ~ 1 + -ma, i.e.: “wo immer” [AHW 210] = “in whatever/every part of ”, conj. “whatever” (< Sem. *"ay-ma) [GAG
§114.i & CAD]. " 4. G. Feichtner (1932, 219) combined Eg. m der Indentität with the Eg. verbal pre"x m- (sic) and the “Hamitic” marker *m expressing a “Tätigkeit mit/gegeneinander ausgeübt”. Similarly, K. Petrá'ek (1987, 319, §2.3) compared AA pre"x *mV- ~ i.a. Eg. m- (noun pre"x) & m (prep.) “in” and even (S) ma “place”, which is unacceptable (cp. LEg. m3«).
" 5. C. T. Hodge (1976, 49; 1981, 374, #35; 1983, 43; 1985, 17; 1991, 640; 1995, 636) used to combine Eg. m and Sem. *b- with Hbr. prep. m1-, positional var. of min- “from, in” (Dahood 1970, 391, 395).
nb1: Dif"cult to accept, since Hbr. m1- is actually just a variant of Hbr. min- before
the de"nite article ha- via assimilation, i.e. *min-ha- " *mih-ha- " m1-ha- (con
"rmed to me by D. Testen in a p.c. on 12 April 1999). Hbr. min- goes back to
Sem. *min + Eg. m.
nb2: Moreover, C. T. Hodge (1991, 156, #15.1) traced back the following words
to an ultimate common origin: Cpt. ma “place”, OEg. m- (pre"x of nomina loci),
m “in, from” ~ Sem. *min “from” and *m- (place pre"x) [cf. Msc. etc. 1964, 80]
~ Brb. *m5n “without” (!) ~ Ch. *mb2 “place” [after IS 1966, 19] and *m- (place
pre"x) and further IE words. No doubt, these are different roots, treated in EDE
under bw, m, m-.
" 6. G. R. Castellino (1984, 14–15) connected the OEg. m der Identität to the Slavic ending -om, cf. Russ. !"# $%&# '!&()*!+ “he was a soldier” etc.! To be examined in a wider Nst. context, which is out of range of EDE. " 7. Ju. N. Zavadovskij (1980, 141–142) views that the NEg. (!) nisba jm.j “which is in . . .” is actually *imi-j “belonging to mouth” (sic)
6m



and goes back to an unattested etymon “mouth”, which is cognate with Brb. *imi “mouth”. Baseless. Rightly rejected by W. A. Ward (1985, 243): “impossible”.
nb1: On the analogy of Eg. jmj, Zavadovskij (l.c.) derived Ar. f5 “in” from PSem.
*p- “mouth”!
nb2: By the way, for the etymology of Brb. “mouth” cf. Eg. mh.wt.
" 8. R. M. Voigt (1999, 42) combined Eg. m & jm “da” with Akk. in (a) “in” derived from *ima (with a shift of *-m- > -n- under the in#ience of Akk. ana), which was rejected by Bla&ek (2004, 5) pointing out that Akk. ina is cognate to Ebl. in (whereby Akk. ana has no traces in Ebl.).
m- (nominal pre"x with several functions).
nb: Its examples are listed e.g. apud Grapow (1914, 16–17), who classifed the fol
lowing sorts of m- pre"x: (1) nomen instr., (2) nomen loci, (3) abstracts (e.g. m«š3
“Menge”, ms0« “Erscheinung”), (4) act./tr. participle (e.g. mnhp “Begatter”, mnhz
“Wachender”), (5) pass./intr. participle (m%nk “Beschenkter”), (6) pre"x of body
parts (Grapow’s exx. are very uncertain: mjz.t “Leber”, mn3r “Eingeweide”, msjn.t,
q.v.), (7) pre"x of “Zeitnomina” (exx. weak). Grapow himself recognized that the
existence of the last two pre"xes is dubious. G. Jéquier (1921, 145) explained the m
in a group of fem. “nomes d’objets” in the MK cof"ns other way: “le sens apparaît
clairement dès qu’on a établi celui de la racine originale: le pré"xe se présente alors
comme une simple préposition, avec son sens usuel”.

The underlying AA *ma- [Old.] = *mV- [ Dlg. & GT] = *ma(i)- or *-m- (!)

ap: NS has a noun derivation morpheme *m in Songhay-Komuz [Bnd. 1994, 51].
K. Petrá'ek (1987, 319, §2.3) compared Eg. m i.a. with the Saharan -m suf"x “der
Lokativität, des Instruments und der Art”, PBantu *mu- pre"x of “Lokativklasse”
[ Mnh.] = *mo- “inside” [ Welmers], Niger-Congo class pre"x & prep. *mo- [ Welm

nb1: It requires further investigation to clarify whether this AA morpheme is related
to Eg. prep. m “in etc.” and its supposed AA re#exes (above). Recently, A. Zaborski
(2001, 598) surmises an etymological connection to Eg. mn “bleiben” and its Ch.
cognates (HSED #1795). Elsewhere, Zaborski (1999, 36–38; 2005, 25, §5.6) derived
the AA participial pre"x *m- from AA *VnV ~ *VmV “to be”.
nb2: The comparison of this common AA derivational morpheme with Sem. *b
“in” & *min “from” (!), Eg. bw “place”, common Cpt. ma “place” (NB: < LEg.
m3«, q.v.), Brb. *m5n “without” (!), Ch. *m-b2 “place” (!), IE *me- “in middle” etc.
(proposed by C. T. Hodge 1990, 653, similarly also Petrá'ek 1987, 319, §2.3) can
be certainly excluded.
nb3: Similarly unconvincing is the comparison (going back to a long tradition) of
the AA *ma- pre"x with the Eg.-Sem. interrogative pron. *m3 “who?” (e.g. apud
Ol’derogge 1956, 7–8; Vycichl 1994, 247), which was rightly rejected by A. Zaborski
(2005, 25, §5.6).

G. del Olmo Lete (1998, 59) combined the Sem. interrogative base *m- with Sem.
*-m (“emphatic, specifying, coordinative postpositive functor”, sic) as well as Sem.
*ma (“negative functor”), which is rather improbable. For the Sem. enclitic particle
*-ma (originating in the interrog. base *m-), which is used for deriving indef. prons.

suggesting an ultimate relationship with the AA *b neg. particle. Hardly so. The
suggestion on the relationship of the AA *m particle and IE *m1 should be discussed
in the frameworks of the Nst. theory.
nb6: G. del Olmo Lete (1998, 59) combined the Sem. *ma “negative functor” with
the Sem. interrogative base *m- as well as Sem. *-m (“emphatic, specifying, coor
dinative postpositive functor”), which is rather improbable. I. M. Diakonoff (1988,
83), in turn, following his master A. P. Riftin, assumes that the AA demonstrative
stem *m- “sometimes evolved . . . into negative and prohibitive particles” (without
providing any typological evidence), which is equally highly dubious.
m (non-encl. part.) “1. siehe, 2. denn” (OK, Wb II 4–5) = “behold” (Grd. 1957, 178, #234; FD 100) = “siehe (hier)” (GHWb 370) = “argumentative Partikel” (LEg., JW 1996, 206–7, #346). ! Usually welded together with a 2nd person suf"x: mk (mostly), also m2 and m2n.

! Origin disputable. #2 & #4 seem to be the most promising solutions. " 1. K. Jansen-Winkeln (1996, 205–6, #346) denied the imperative nature of the particle (“Bei mk/m!n hat man es . . . sicher nicht mit einem Imperativ zu tun, wie manchmal vermutet wird . . .”), although he says “Dennoch wird Edel letzlich recht darin haben, mk . . . mit den Imperativen jmj ‘gib’, mj ‘komm’ und mj ‘nimm’ zusammenzustellen . . .” (cf. Edel AÄG §606–613), and "nally ends up with assuming for all these words an underlying Eg. “deiktisches Element” *m( j) “hier, da!” (sic).
nb: For a Sem. enclitic deictic element *-m see recently W. W. Müller’s (1985, 272)
paper. Cf. also Testen 1993, 306–8, #4.
" 2. G. Takács (1996, 17, §7.2): agreeing with A. H. Gardiner (1957, 178, #234: “possibly an obsolete imper. meaning ‘behold’ ”) and W. Czermak (1931, 46: “Element m etwa ‘siehe’ imperativischer Bedeutung”), OEg. m can be rightly supposed to have originally been a frozen impv., lit. “see!” (cf. also AÄG §612–3). Thus, the otherwise unattested OEg. *m or *mj “to see” (or sim.) could be equated with NBrb.: (?) Qbl. ta-maw-t “regard, attention” [ Dlt. 1982, 527] !!! LECu.: Afar ma«aye

The only problem to hinder this Eg. < AA derivation might be the unexpected medial ECu. *-«- (the apparently purely orthographic -« in the Eg. particle
after m has hardly anything to do with it).
ap: NS *(-)mo “eye, face” [Bnd. 1994, 1160, #25; 2005, 101, #148] vs. NS *mã “to

1918–1919, 27–28; Ehret 1982, 174).
nb1: As noted by Takács (1996, 17, §7.2), this Eg.-Cu.-Ch. isogloss is to be separated
from OEg. m33 [*mrr/*mll] “to see, look” (Eg. -33 + Ch. *-y), although the WCh.:
Bole-Tangale *mayu “to see” and its African areal parallels have been frequently
compared with Eg. m33, see Mnh. 1912, 238 (Khoisan-Eg.); Pls. 1960, 125, #2
(Eg.-Ngamo); OS 1992, 200–201 (PWCh.-PCCh.-Eg.); JI 1994 I, 145 (Eg.-Ch.);
HSED #1761 (Eg.-Buduma) etc.
nb2: G. Lefèbvre (1940, #361) derived OEg. m directly from OEg. m33, which, as
said above, is improbable.
nb3: H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 I, 145) take the Chadic forms
from PCh. *m-y-* “to see” with a supposed erosion of the "nal *-* > -y in all BT
examples but Kupto mè*-, which is in fact the only argument for the "nal *-* in
this PCh. root. JI l.c. opinion that “this root may be analysed (so, -s-) in the light
of the possible cognates in Anc. Eg. mrr (sic!) ’to see, look at’ and Akk. amaru (so,
-a-) ‘to see’ . . . ”, which, however, explains neither Ch. *-y- nor *-*. But with respect
to the extra-Ch. evidence, and also to my observations in inner Chadic historical
phonology, it seems more defendable to assume two distinct Ch. roots, namely *m-y-*
(Kupto) and *m-y (Sha, BT, Bdm.). By the way, in an earlier work H. Jungraithmayr
& K. Shimizu (1981, 219D) still set up bicons. PCh. *m-y “see”.
nb4: There can be no connection between Hdy. mo"- and “OCu.” *bek- “to see”
[Lmb.] as suggested by M. Lamberti and R. Sottile (1997, 312).
nb5: It is uncertain if the developed meaning “to think” < “to see” of the same
AA root is attested in WCh.: Kulere mà “denken” [ Jng. 1970, 353] !! CCh.: Mafa
maya “intelligence, manière, savoir-faire” [Brt.-Bléis 1990, 236] !! ECh.: WDng.
mòyè “méditer, avoir la nostalgie de, regretter, penser à, songer, être triste” [Fédry
1973, 136], EDng. móyé “se rappeler, se souvenir, se remémorer, se ressouvenir,
penser, songer, méditer, ré#échir, rêver, révasser, être préoccupé, être triste, ressasser,
se soucier, se faire des soucis, être en soucis” [ Dbr.-Mnt. 1973, 210] = “sich erin
nern, sich Sorgen machen” [Ebs. 1979, 128; 1987, 81, 93], Bidiya moy “penser,
ré#échir, se souvenir” [AJ 1989, 100] (as it is in fact attested in WCh.: Ngamo moy
“1. to see, 2. think” [Ibr.], above) or we should assume a cognacy with Eg. m%j
“sich Sorge machen” (Wb, q.v.). From this viewpoint especially noteworthy is the
alternative equation of the AA root for “to see” (decribed above) with Eg. *m% (?)
" Cpt. (S) mouH, (B) moh “to see” (below).
" 3. A. Ember (1914, 305, #3) suggested a comparison with Akk. mâ “thus, as follows”. But W. von Soden classi"es the functions of Akk. -ma as follows: “hervorhebende Partikel und Konjunktion: 1. zur meist identi"zierenden Heraushebung einzelner Wörter, 2. zwischen koordinierten Sätzen und In"nitiven nach dem ersten Präd.: und dann, und daher” [AHW 560].
m 17



nb: I suggest that the conjunctive, viz. emphatical function of the Sem. particle
*-ma, should be distinguished:
(1) On the one hand, cp. Ug. -m (copulative) “and” [ WUS #1492] !! Tigre -mä
“and etc.” [ Lsl.] etc. (Sem.: Lsl. 1969, 19) !!! NAgaw: Hamir -me, -im, -m “und,
nun” [Rn. 1884, 390] !!! CCh.: Bdm. ma (Konjunktion) [Lks. 1939, 118]. This
cognate set might be identi"ed, following Ember’s proposal, with OEg. m (of m-k
etc.), although semantically not too suggestive.
(2) On the other hand, cp. ES: Geez -mma “particle of emphasis: precisely, quite,
then” [Lsl. 1987, 323], Har. -ma “as to, indeed” [Lsl. 1963, 102], for which cf.
rather the OEg. encl. part. m (below).
" 4. If the deictic sense *“here you are” or “dann, then” of Eg. m was the original one, cf. Ch. *m with deictic and demonstr. function: CCh.: Mafa má, mé “pour le bon, cette fois, maintenant” [Brt.-Bléis 1990, 218], Mada máyá “alors, donc, vraiment” [Brt.-Brunet 2000, 197] !! ECh.: Mkl. mê, mè, mî, mì “là” [ Jng. 1990, 138].
nb: Perhaps of the same origin are Sem.: Akk. -m of mimation [ Djk.: origin. an
article] !!! WCh.: Angas ma ~ mwa “they” !! CCh.: Buduma ma “this” ! Masa mu
“he” etc.? See IS 1976, #303 (Sem.-Ch.).
" 5. F. Calice (unpublished, quoted by W. F. Albright 1937–1939, 71), followed by C. H. Gordon (1955, 288, #1098), W. G. E. Watson (1996, 707), and recently Y. Muchiki (1999, 282) equated Eg. mk with Sem.: Ug. mk “behold” [Alb.] = “lo” [Gordon & Segert 1984, 192] = mk (adv.) “1. dort, 2. dann” [ WUS #1652] = mk II (deictic functor!) “behold, see!” [ DUL 542: etymology uncertain].
nb1: This parallelism is all the more indeed striking, because Ug. mk – to the best
of my knowledge – has no safe common Sem. etymology as con"rmed also by
Muchiki l.c. (unless what noted in nb2 is valid). But Eg. mk is a combination of the
m (particle) + -k (2nd person masc. sg. suf"x). It is questionable whether Ug. mk can
be analyzed the same way as Eg. mk. Another solution could be that OEg. m2 and
m2n (suggesting a common root m-) were just secondary back formations due to
a Volksetymologie which treated the orig. OEg. bicons. (?) root *mk as suf"xed by -k.
Otherwise, the Eg. and Ug. forms cannot be genetically cognate. Or, as W. G. E.
Watson (l.c.) and Muchiki (l.c.) suggestively argue, Ug. mk could have been borrowed
from Eg. (before the reign of Suppiluliuma I as Muchiki l.c. assumes q.v.).
nb2: J. Aistleitner (WUS #1652) and DUL 542 related the Ug. particle mk to Ug. mk
“dort, dann” [ WUS] and Akk. amma-ka(m) " NAss. maka “there”, cf. amma interj.
“da (ist)!” [AHW 43] = “lo!” [ Muchiki 1999, 282], which DUL l.c. divides into m(h)
+ enclitic -k. S. Segert (1984, 192), in turn, compares it with Akk. (NAss.) muk(u)
~ m$ (nach 1.Sg. vor dir. Rede stat m3) [AHW 669: of obscure origin] = muk(u)
~ mu (particle, introducing direct speech after verbs in the "rst person sing.) [CAD
m 180]. Not clear whether the Sem. forms have any connection to EBrb.: Gdm.
MK: 2mm2k “conjonction et adverbe: emploi à l’af"rmatif, et à l’interrogatif ” [Lnf.
1973, 208, #993] !! SBrb.: Ayr 2nka/- < 2772k-a (pron. dém. coll.) “ceci (auprès
de moi), cela, ce dont, il est question, 2. adv.: ainsi etc.” [PAM 2003, 608].
" 6. A. S. Chetveruhin (1990, 137–138) derived Eg. m directly from PAA *m-l “day, light etc.”. Cf. also Takács 1996, 16, §7.
nb: To be rejected for semantic reasons. For the problem cf. OEg. m33 (below).
Hardly any etymological connection between OEg. m “see, behold” and m33 (for
which cf. also Czermak 1931, 46).
18 m



" 7. C. T. Hodge (1990, 171, #3) had a similar, but perhaps even more far-fetching proposal: Eg. m [< *mj after E. Edel] “behold!” < **"2-NblV- ~ Eg. *bl = bnr & br “eye” (q.v.) ~ m33 (q.v.), all from
an AA-IE (Lislakh) proto-root **b-l “eye, to see”.
nb: Eg. m vs. *bl vs. m33 are three different roots.
m ~/< mj (encl. particle) “doch: 1. nach einem Imperativ (z.B. sage doch, komme doch!), 2. jw m (MK) als Satzanfang in Briefen” (OK, Wb II 36, 6–7) = “enclitic particle occasionally found after imperatives or . . . after the s3m.f form when used to express a wish” (Grd. 1957, 185, §250) = “pray” (Caminos 1954 LEM 460 with further lit.) = “(nach Imperativ, selten davor) bitte, dich!” (GHWb 323) = “please, pray” (DLE I 210).
nb1: Perhaps originally mj as suggested e.g. in Wb (NK & GR exx. for mj), GHWb
l.c. after E. Edel (AÄG 62, §140) who gives sporadical OK (PT) exx. for mj (cf. also
ÜKAPT VI 129) compared with (S) Ha-moi “o daß doch, wenn doch” (KHW 372)
< LEg. h(3)n-mj “o that!” (DLE II 80, cf. AL 77.2477). The var. mj occurs also in
Edfu (PL 392 and 410).
nb2: Occurs also non-enclitically before “cohortative” sdm=f (Caminos l.c.).
nb3: Note that the interpretation of PT (429c & 687b) mjw “Imperativ oder
Interjektion als Imperativersatz” (K. Sethe, ÜKAPT VI 129) is disputed (cf. e.g.
ÄWb I 512). The same is the case with PT 264 & 520 mj (following 3d “sagen”)
rendered as “vielleicht eine Form des Fragewortes m” (Wb II 36, 8), which has
been compared with the enclitic particle m( j) of Wb II 36, 6–7, cf. JEA 16 (1930),
171–2; AL 77.1639.
nb4: W. G. E. Watson (1999, 130) as well as G. del Olmo Lete & J. Sanmartín (DUL
519) see in Ug. m« “I pray (enclitic of entreaty)” [ Watson] = (postpositional emph.
after an impv.) “please!” [ DUL] a probable match of Eg. m( j), but the -« vs. Eg.
-Ø can hardly be explained. Note that the occasional -« in the writing of the Eg.
particle was purely orthographical.
! A. Ember (1914, 303–304, #2) combined the Eg. particle with certain re#exes of Sem. *-ma (emphatic part.) [GT] = *-m (“emphatic, specifying, coordinative postpositive functor”) [OL 1998, 60]: Akk. -ma “hervorhebende Partikel und Konjunktion: 1. zur meist identi"zierenden Heraushebung einzelner Wörter” [AHW 560] !! perhaps Ug. -m (emphatic, determinative encl. morpheme) [ DUL 509, cf. also Watson 1996, 259–268], Canaanite (Amarna) -ma (“adds special emphasis” on an inf. functioning as a "nite verb) [Rainey vs. Hnrg. 1998, 75, III.229] !!

m ~/< mj 19



polite commands)” [Gragg 1982, 283] = (Borana, Orma, Wellega) m1 [m6] (particle used in questions and commands) [Strm. 1987,
365, cf. Strm. 2001, 55] ! Dullay: Dbs. má (emphatische Partikel bei Fragen) “etwa?” vs. (bei Imperativen) “doch!” vs. (bei Negationen) “keineswegs!” [AMS 1980, 173] !!! WCh.: Goemai ma (kind of adv.) “indeed” [Srl. 1937, 132] (GT 2004, 239: apparently isolated in AS) ! Dera mà “hortative marker” [ Nwm. 1974, 129] !! CCh.: Gisiga ma “verstärkerndes ma: doch, auch” [Lks. 1970, 127] !! ECh.: Mokilko mê, mè “Verstarkungspartikel” [Lks. 1975, 224].
nb1: The conjunctive, viz. emphatical function of the Sem. particle *-ma should
be distinguished, cp. Ug. -m (copulative) “and” [ WUS #1492] !! Tigre -mä “and
etc.” [Lsl.], Gafat -m (conjonction d’instance) [Lsl.] etc. (ES: Lsl. 1956, 212; Sem.:

Bdm. ma (Konjunktion) [Lks. 1939, 118] !! ECh.: Mubi mà “et, puis” [ Jng. 1990
MS]. This cognate set could hardly be identi"ed (contra A. Ember’s l.c. proposal)
with the non-encl. OEg. m (of m-k etc.). Beside the conjunctive particle, there is
also an AA *m particle of opposition, which should also be separated, cf. NBrb.:
Mzab & Wargla ammwa “mais” [ Dlh. 1984, 113; 1987, 182] !!! WCh.: Dera àmmá
“but” [ Nwm. 1974, 121]
nb2: G. del Olmo Lete (1998, 59–60) combined Sem. *-m (“emphatic, specifying,
coordinative postpositive functor”, sic) with the Sem. interrogative base *m- as well
as Sem. *ma (“negative functor”), which is rather improbable.
nb3: Cf. perhaps also Akk. -mi ~ -me (all) “wird in zitierter direkten Rede an betonte
Wörter angehängt” [AHW 650]?
m “nimm!” (PT, Wb II 36, 1; GHWb 323) = nimm! empfang!” (ÜKAPT VI 127) = “take!” (FD 100).
nb1: The commonly accepted reading mj (suggested e.g. in Wb l.c.; CED 79; NBÄ
510, n. 233; DELC 107; and GHWb l.c. DCT 151; ÄWb I 507) seems, for the time
being, questionable. J. ,erný (CED l.c.) rightly put a query-mark to his hypothetic
m- (?) “take!”. At any rate, Osing’s pre-Cpt. form *má" < Eg. *máj/w- (NBÄ 510)
seems less risky than Fecht’s (1960, 131, §252) twofold far-fetched Eg. *jm3 (sic!) <
(pl.) *j'mã3'j ~ *j'mÉ3'j (with *j- and *-3), but neither is proven.
nb2: Whether the special orthography of mn n-k “nimm im Empfang (eigtl.: nimm
für dich)!” (PT, Wb II 60, 1–4) = “take to yourself !” (FD 106; Grd. 1927, #336) =
“nimm!” (GHWb 333) with the mnw-sceptre covered an impv. ( j).mn “take!” (cf.
e.g. Hodge 1990, 173), or a contraction of mj + dat. (as alluded to in Wb l.c.), is
uncertain. Cf. s.v. mn below.
! Cpt. re#exes: (S) !mo, mw, pl. !mheitN, (SB) mo (m), (B) me (f ), (A) mau “nimm!” (KHW 87) = “prends! (DELC 107, cf. Vcl. 1990, 240) = “take!” (CD 159a). " 1. I suggest it is cognate with WCh.: Ngamo maa-t- [-t- prob. af"x] “to take back” [Ibr. 2003 MS, 6] ! Ngizim máw [Frj. & Schuh] = m3u “to take (up), pick up, take up as a load” [Schuh 1981, 112] = mì “to take” [Schuh], Duwai mùwó “to take” [Frj., Schuh] = àamí “to take” [Schuh] (Ngz.-Duwai: Schuh 1977, 151, 155; Frj. 1982, 32). Any connection to MSA: Jbl. míy “to touch” [ Nkn. 1986, 80, #597]?
20 m



ap: L. Homburger (1929, 171) combined OEg. m with Mal mo “prends!”. Th.
Obenga (1993, 290, #18) also suggested tempting Afr. parallels: Mbochi má
“prends!”, Bantu (sic) má “prends, tiens, viens!”, Sotho mme “prends!”, Senufo ma
“tiens!”, Bambara mo “tiens!”, Yoruba mu “prendre”, Sango mu “prendre”, Kuba
(Bushong) mmá “prends!”, Isekiri mT “prends!”.
nb1: It seems that ECh.: Somray mì ~ myÜ “voler (to steal)” [ Jng. 1978, 188, also
JI 1994 II, 309] does not belong here. It derives presumably from PCh. *m-r “to
steal” with erosion of *-r (for further deatils cf. Eg. m3r “to rob”).
nb2: V. M. Illi'-Svity' (1984, #376) treated OEg. m as the only re#ex of AA *m
“take!” < Nst. *qamV “,-)*)*.”. Hardly so. For the suggested Nst. proto-form cf.
rather Eg. 0m«.
" 2. Alternatively, if the OEg. impv. was indeed *mj [< *ml], it might be compared with Sem.: OSA (Sab.) mly “to get, win, obtain as booty”, ml-t “booty, loot, prize of war” [SD 86] = mly “to take as booty” [Biella 1984, 276] !!! CCh.: Vulum (Mulwi) mìlì “to pick up, lift, take, ramasser, prendre” [Trn. 1978, 304; Brt. 1995, 217], Mbara màl “to pick up, lift, ramasser”, cf. mùl “1. ramasser, 2. prendre (plusieurs choses à la fois)” [TSL 1986, 199, 273], Musgu-Puss mili “prendre (plusieurs choses)” [Trn. 1991, 106], Musgu-Girvidik m2l- ~ mul- “nehmen” [ MB 1972–73, 70].
nb: Biella’s l.c. etymology for OSA mly is dubious (Ar. mlw). Cf. perhaps rather
Akk. mll (under Eg. m3r “to rob”).
" 3. C. T. Hodge (1990, 172–3) presented a far-fetching hypothesis on the origin of Eg. m [Hodge: alternatively jm] “take!” (PT), which he relates to OEg. jmj ~ m “give!” (from an earlier *má3 < *"2mbá3 <
*"2-Nb-l). The supposed ultimate source would be Lislakh (IE-AA)
**b-l “to carry” with the semantic shift: “moving an object by hand” " i.e. “carrying it” " “to take” (cp. Hausa *àùkáá “to take away” & *áúkóó “to bring”). Unacceptable for me, just like the author’s further proto-roots and suggestions summarized in the NB.
nb: Hodge derives the following forms from LL **b-l “to carry” in the frameworks of
his consonant ablaut theory (more on this in Hodge 1986, 143–162): Eg. nb3 “carrying

" 3. Another, less probable, way of explaining OEg. *m3 “sickle” is a relationship with AA *m-l “to cut off, shave (?)” [GT]: Hbr. mll II qal & mwl qal “beschneiden”, m$l3(h) “Beschneidung” [GB 404, 430–1] = mwl & mll qal “to circumcise” [KB 555, 594] !!!

m3.t “das Rohr des Schilfs” (V., Niuserre, Weltkammer, Wb II 6, 11) = “joncs” (Bissing 1955–6, 333) = “Phragmites communis” (Edel 1961, 252, cf. pl. 13) = “tige” (Charpentier apud Baum, also Borghouts 1978, 30–31 apud AL 78.1595) = “Phragmites australis (plante, herbe aquatique)” (Baum 1988, 120, 241) = “*gemeines Schilfrohr (Phragmites communis syn.

" 4. N. Skinner (1984, 33) treated OEg. m3 as a re#ex of AA *-B-"

m3.tj (dual) “two ends (?) of a sinew” (late NK hapax: Pap. Chester Beatty VII, rt. 4:1, Grd., HPBM III 58) = “the two shafts (of the crest of a heron)” (Dawson 1936, 106) = “terminaisons (d’un tendon) (?)” (AC 1978, 8) = “extrémités (?)” (AL 77.1573 & 78.1593) = “termination of a tendon” (DLE I 208) = “*die beiden Enden (der Sehne, vom Kopf der Phoenix)” (GHWb 315). Hapax: Pap.Chester Beatty VII, rt. 4:1 (late NK Mag.).
nb: Quoting Dawson (l.c.) apud AC l.c. is misleading, since the former author did
in fact not accept the rendering “two ends (?) of a sinew” from a bird’s brow (Grd.)
in the context (m3.tj n rw3 m wp.t=f ) referring to a ‘phoenix’, i.e., a heron with
a long crest springing from the top of the head (wp.t “vertex, division, parting of
the hair”) and directed backwards similarly to “two long "laments”. According to
Dawson, rw3 denoted here the semi-#exible shafts of these crest-feathers, which
were made of gut, while the bird in question was presumably a wooden model.
" 1. D. Meeks (AL 77.1573) regarded it as a dual of OEg. (Abusir) m3.t “proue (d’un navire)” (above), which is disproved by the rendering by Dawson (above), which would lead instead rather to assuming an etymological connection with Eg. m3w.t “Stange, Schaft (des Speeres)” (PT, Wb, below).
m3.tj 27



" 2. GT: in principle, the common rendering “end” (or sim.) would make a derivation from AA *m-l “end” [GT] probable, cf. LECu.: Afar mùluy (m) “end, "nish, last time”, muluye “to terminate” [PH 1985, 171] !!! WCh.: perhaps Sha má% ~ má “beenden” " mumá% ~ múmá«i [«/% reg. < *r] “Ende” [ Jng. 1970, 287] ! Dera mal
“enden, aufhören” [ Jng. 1966 MS, 10] = máalè [-l- < *-l-/*-r-] “to have "nished” [ Nwm. 1974, 129].
nb1: At the "rst glance, SBrb.: EWlm. 3-mur, pl. i-marr-3n “pointe de #èche” [ Ncl.
1957, 55] could also belong here. But its etymology is questionable, cf. EWlm. &
Ayr 2-7ur ~ 2-77ur, pl. i-7-rr--n “#èche” [PAM 1998, 221], Hgr. --mor, pl.
i-murr-en “#èche” [Fcd. 1951–2, 1224]. Any connection with AA *m-l “arrow,
lance” [GT] (see Eg. m3w.t “shaft” below)?
nb2: Ch. Ehret (1997, 203, #1799) suggests that Afar muluy ~ OEg. mnq (q.v.) <
AA *-mul- “to end” (intr.). Wrong.
" 3. GT: less probably, provided Eg. m3- derived from *m"-, a con
nection to the monoradical Brb. root *m should not be ruled out, cf. NBrb.: Snh. 2a-ma, pl. 2a-mi-win “pan d’un vêtement” [Rns. 1932, 384], Temsaman & Bqy. 2i-mûu-an “board” [Brn. 1917, 93], Mzab t-ma, pl. ti-mi-wa “côté, direction” [ Dlh. 1984, 114], Bugi 2a-ma & Tarudant tsa-ma “côté” [Bst. 1890, 312], Qbl. ta-ma, pl. ta-mi-win “1. côté, face, 2. lisière” [ Dlt. 1982, 479] !!

nb: These forms might well be derived from the root *m “mouth” (as suggested by
K.-G. Prasse in PAM). On the other hand, the Berber root might be alternatively
equated with Sem.: Sqt. my«: mí«eh “côté” [SSL 1991, 1466, cf. Lsl. 1938, 248 with
false Sqt. etymology], which, naturally, excludes a connection with Eg. m3.tj.
m3 “eine wohlriechende P#anze” (LP, GR, Wb II 11, 10) = m33 (!) “un arbre ou arbuste de la famille des platanacées (non indigène en Égypte), qui produit à la fois l’oléo-résine (recherchée pour la parfumerie sacrée); un végétal arborescent, odorant, porteur de ‘graines’, contenant une gomme-résine” (Goyon 1984, 82). Cf. also Dem. m33 “scented plant used in preparing styrax” (Pap. Wien 3873, Vos 1993, 349, no. 238).
nb: Reading (m3 or m33) and meaning debated. Similarly to Wb. l.c., Junker (1959,
154) identi"ed this m3 of Wb with the second component of LEg. g3j(w)-m3 “eine
wohlriechende P#anze” (LP, GR, Wb V 158, 5). Following this idea, Goyon (1984,
81–82, cf. also AEB 84.303) assumed a resin name *g3l-m33 “Styrax of"cinalisL.
(Styraceae)” (identi"ed with nnjb “Liquidambar Or. Mill.” and its product styrax in
a text from the laboratory at the Edfu temple of Horus) with the second component
-m33 akin to Eg. m3 (Wb II 11, 10) transcribed by him as m33 and designating, in
Goyon’s view, the family of platanaceae (where Liquidambar also belongs). Goyon
saw the same word in nh.t-m33 “un arbre ou arbrisseau producteur de gommes ou
oléo-résines” (botanically unidenti"ed) as well as in m33 (Pap.Ramesseum V 56:53,
28 m3



see below). But Aufrère (1986, 9–10, §XI.4 & p. 10, fn. 2) denied the equation of
the 2nd element of g3jw-m3 with that of nh.t-m3 (which he de"ned as “une arbre
odoriférante, le Liquidambar orientalis”), and considered (contra Goyon l.c.) LEg.
m3 (Wb II 11, 10; Mariette: Dendara I 72c) as “une écriture fautive pour” m3t.t (q.v.),
which in Dendara “servait de phylactère à la déesse Hathor de Dendara” and “désignait le
céleri et non le calotrope” (i.e., it is = m3t.t, q.v. + m32.t, q.v.).

m3 29



m33 “sehen” (OK, Wb II 7–10) = “to look, see” (FD 100).
nb1: H. Satzinger (1994, 200; cf. Hodge 1966, 44; Lpr. 1982, 78 & 88, n. 23) sees
in the MEg. subjunctive m3n=f [< *mll-f ] “daß er sehe” (cf. also Snk. LÄ IV 210,
n. 19; Vrg. 1971, 55 quoting Thacker 1954) the trace of an original *-ll > -33,
cf. also the CT divine name m3-%3-f ~ mn-%3-f, act. *“der hinter sich schaut”.
C. Peust (1999, 169) assumes three allomorphs: m33, m3, m3n > later mn (see
Smith 1984), and leaves undecided whether m33 or m3n was the basic form. For
the wtg. of m33 in CT cf. Cenival 1977. Note that Wit (1979, 446) explained the
GR value mn of the two eyes hrgl. from an interchange of m3n ~ m33 (with the
loss of -3-?).
nb2: Sh. Allam (1987, 3) surmizes a Nebenbedeutung “beaufsichtigen” (not in Wb) in a
few occurences of m33 or its derivative m3.w “inspection” from Dyn. XVIII (Urk.
IV 57, 124:9, 1006:16, 1119:16), which, in his view, is surviving also in Eg. Ar. dial.
m3"a “etwas anstarren, scharf beobachten”. Allam even reinterpreted the famous
Dyn. III ex. of mr “overseer” (cf. Helck 1954, 76; for sources cf. also Allam 1987,
1, fn. 6) as m3.(w) “Beaufsichtiger”, which is very dubious.
! From the same root (m33 < *mll or *mrr) derive i.a. the following forms: (1) m3.w-%r “Spiegel” (CT, Wb II 10, 15). (2) m3.tj “die Augen (von Sonne und Mond als Augen des Himmels” (LP, GR, Wb II 11, 12) = “les deux yeux (du Soleil et de la Lune)” (El-Sayed 1987, 64), attested already in CT m33.tj (RT 14, 1893, 165) “les deux voyants (comme désignation des yeux)” (Volten 1959, 27, fn. 3) = m33.w.tj “eyes” (DCT 153: CT VI 123b). Cf. also m33.t (dual m33.tj) “Auge” in Mundöffnung, Spruch 33 (Helck 1967, 35). Dubious whether the same word occurs in CT I 241e m3.tj (sun det.) “(subst. de sens inconnu)” (AL 78.1599 referring to Wb II 11, 12!), since Faulkner (AECT I 52, n. 5 of Spell 53) surmised here a noun “light” (identical with m3w.t “rays of light”). (3) mr.t “Auge (einer Gottheit)” (BD, GR, Wb II 107), q.v. (4) m3r “surveiller, superviser” (Edfu IV 279:1, Meeks 1999, 580). (5) Probably m3r.w “viewingplace (in sun-cult)” (XVIII., FD 103).
nb1: W. Helck (ZÄS 79, 1954, 76–77) derived also Eg. mr “Aufseher”, alongside
with m33 “sehen” and mr.t “Auge”, from the root *mll. Sh. Allam (1987, 3), in turn,
explained the Dyn. III ex. of the title mr (written with the owl + 2 eyes) directly
from m33 (for an early wtg. of m33 “to see” with owl see IÄF 388). Both sugges
tions are improbable in this form. See the entry for Eg. mr below.
nb2: This root *mll > m33 has been connected Edel (1956, 9, fn. 1), Volten (1959, 27
& fn. 3), Helck (1967, 35), Roccati (1970, 32), Westendorf (KHW 22), and Loprieno
(1982, 88, n. 23) also with Cpt.: (SB) bal “Auge”, which is certainly unacceptable
phonologically (as rightly pointed out already by W. A. Ward 1978, 145, #288 &
#289.3), since the true Eg. etymon of the latter was GR br.wj “die beiden Augen”,
cf. br “sehen, erblicken” (Wb I 465, 5–6) < AA *b-l “to see” [GT]. For details see
the entry for Eg. br in EDE II.

DP: H. Möller (1911, 166) combined Sem. *"mr “sagen, sprechen” with IE *m-r
(sic) “verkündigen”.
nb1: There were debates on the basic sense of Sem. *"mr (see KB 65 with further lit.).
Although the semantic shift “to say” vs. “see” (presumably via “to let see, know”) is
widely attested, Rundgren (1963, 181) claimed the etymological connection between
Hbr. "mr “sagen” vs. Akk. am3ru “sehen” as “nie erklärt”. Instead, rightly and cor
rectly, Rundgren (l.c.) pointed to such typological parallels as IE *sekw- “1. bemerken,
sehen, 2. zeigen” [IEW 897] > i.a. Gk. (Homer) .""!/! (= Lat. 5nseque) “sage an!
erzähle!”, German sehen vs. sagen etc.; or IE *dei«- “zeigen” [LEW I 348] > Lat.
d5c. “spreche” vs. Gk. 0!1$"#2& “zeige”. He explained (1) Ar. "amar-at- “Zeichen,
Wegweiser”, tu-"m$r- “sign, or mark, set up to show the way in the waterless desert”
[Lane 97–98] from *”sehen lassen”; (2) Hbr. "3mar as a “neu gebildet” after y.mar
< *y3mir < caus. *ya"mir “sehen lassen, zeigen, befehlen, sagen” or via *"a"mar <
*ha""mar; (3) Tigre "amra “wissen” as a denom. verb < "3m2r “verständig” [LH].
Finally, however, Rundgren (as several authors also) concluded that the underlying
root might be etymologically connected to Sem. *"mr “hell sein, strahlen” (cf. Geez
"am5r “sol, di1s”) via a “possessivischer Stativ” *"amir “ist gesehen” (cf. Or.Suec. 9,
1961, 98) with the same semantic shift as in Ar. "ab)ara “erblicken”, denom. <
ba)ar- “Blick” (orig. *“Glanz”) or German blicken < Gmc. *bleik-a- “glänzen” [Kluge
1999, 119]. Interestingly, Rundgren (l.c.) found Koehler’s Grundbedeutung “hell sein,
sichtbar machen, kund tun” as hardly "tting. Leslau (1958, 11) also compared Sem.
*"mr “to see, say” with Tigre "ammära “hell, klar sein”. Similarly, KB 65: PSem.
*"mr basic sense “to be light”. J. Sanmartín (1973, 263-270), in turn, discussed the
Ug. & Sem. exx. of *"mr “sehen” vs. “sagen” separately.
nb2: H. Bauer (1935, 174, #2) derived Syr. dmr “admirari” from a t-pre"x (sic) +
Sem. *"mr “to see”.
nb3: A. Ju. Militarev (MM 1983, 173) found W. Leslau’s (1938, 315) explanation
of the sporadic change «- < *-"- in MSA (as being due to the in#uence of *-r)
unsatisfactory, and instead sought in MSA *«- a Sem. heritage shared with Ar.
«amm3r- “grave et doux dans ses paroles” [BK II 366], which is a mistake, since
the basic sense of Ar. «mr was fully different. The same is valid for Militarev’s (l.c.)
comparison of Sem. *"mr with Ar. hamm3r- “2. bavard, loquace, qui, pour ainsi
dire, répand un torrent de paroles”, which is in fact a metaphoric sense of “1. qui
verse à la fois une grande quantité de pluie (nuage)” < hamara I “2. répandre,
verser (de l’eau, des larmes)” [BK II 1445].

nb6: Jungraithmayr & Ibriszimow (1994 I, 145) equated the isogloss of Eg. m33
vs. Akk. "am3ru with their PCh. *m-y-* “to see”, which is phonologically highly
disputable: PCh. ** + Eg. 3 vs. Akk. r. In addition, the WChadic (Sha, BT group)
forms in question ( JI 1994 II 284–5) display rather an etymon *may ~ *moy, cf.
Bole-Tangale *mayu “to see” [Schuh 1984, 217], which is hardly cognate with the
single piece of evidence for PCh. *-* set up by JI, namely WCh.: BT: Kupto mè*-,
for which, cf. rather perhaps Ar. m9w: ma93 I “7. ouvrir les yeux” [BK II 1124].

“arbre ou arbuste de la famille des platanacées, qui produit à la fois l’oléo-résine et
la gomme-résine (recherchée pour la parfumerie sacrée)”. Thus, in his view, pr.t-m33

nb1: The striking similarity of PSomray *muy- “lion” and Cpt.: (SBAF) moui “lion”
may be due to a pure chance too. In any case, the explanation of Eg. -3- would be
a bit problematic, although the 3rd yods are in perfect match. Nevertheless, I would
identify PSomray *muy “lion” rather with OEg. m%j.t (below).
nb2: Is HECu. *m.yy- “beast of prey” related (Takács 1999, 107, #34)? Cp. Burji
m.yy-a, Had. m.-''a, Kmb. m.-''u, Sid. moy-''o etc. (HECu.: Hds. 1989, 25;
414; Lsl. 1988, 195). Or does belong to OEg. mw.t (q.v.)?
" 4. K. Piehl (1893, 492) views that Eg. m3j “lion” can hardly be separated from mj.w “cat”, since “les deux doivent avoir été différenciés originairement d’un même mot”, which eventually may perhaps hold true of PAA (where roots *m-r ~ *m-l for both animals were present), but hardly of Eg. " 5. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 215, #1839) suggests AA *-ma"- “to become
big” " Sem. *m" “to be come large, wide” [Ehret] ~ Eg. m3j ~
SOm.: Ari ma"at “big”. Unacceptable.
m3j “die Samen#üssigkeit im Mutterleibe” (Amarna, Wb II 12, 10) = “foetus” (FD 101) = “Foetus” (GHWb 315). Fem.: m3j.t “semence” (KRI II 197, 11, AL 79.1103). ! Presumably from the same root: (1) NK mjw “seed of man” (FD 104: Urk. IV 1679:7) vs. mj ~ mjw “1. der Same des Menschen, 2. Sohn” (XIX.-GR, Wb II 36, 4–5) = mj “seed” (de Wit 1956, 114: Edfu IV 178:12) = mj “semence, germe” (AL 79.1176 quoting KRI II 179:11, 603:3) = mj “seed (human)” (XIX., DLE I 210) = mj “1. Same (des Menschen), 2. ("g.) Sohn, Foetus” (GHWb 323) = mj “semen” (Edfu, PL 413). (2) mwj “Same (bildlich für Sohn)” (LP hapax, Wb II 53, 4) = “semence, germe” (AL 79.1176).
nb1: Written with the hrgl. “three riples” (N35) due to a contamination with mw
“water, urine”?
nb2: Its earlier attestation is uncertain. The attempts to "nd one seem rather to be
arti"cial projection of a late hapax to rare and obscure PT forms. Ch. Leitz (1996,
417–8) suggested for PT 426b mwj (written alphabetically) “(Wort im Zaubertext,
anscheinend im Wortspiel mit mw ‘Wasser’)” (Wb II 53, 10, hapax) the sense “Same”
in a very obscure Schlangenzauber: jb4 mwj m mw “Der Same (= das Gift) vermische
( jb4 für 3b0??) sich im Wasser”, which was rendered by R. O. Faulkner (AEPT 86)
quite differently (but equally speculatively): “(spit them out at once?) they (= the
poison-sacs) being "lled (?) with water” by adopting K. Sethe’s (ÜKAPT VI 92)
arti"cial jb4mwj (sic) (m mw) “reich an Saft, überfüllt (mit Wasser)”.
nb3: R. O. Faulkner (AEPT 38, utt. 205, n. 4) read the divine name in PT 123a
as mw.t “Mowet: Semen personi"ed as goddess?”. R. Hannig, in turn, reconstructs
mm.t “Memet, ’Hervorquellendes Wasser’ (e. Personi"kation)” (ÄWb I 1593).
m3j 39



! Origin uncertain due to the late attestation and because of -3-. At the moment, most hopeful seems a genetic relationship either with #1 or #2.
nb: LEg. mj can hardly be “a corruption of mw(t) semen” (as suggested e.g. in AL
79.1176 and PL 413). The orthography of Amarna m3j was clearly distinguished
from that of mw “water”. The former was probably only later assimilated occasion
ally to that of mw “water” as a result of a possible contamination, which proves
no etymological relationship between Eg. mw “water” and Amarna m3j “seminal
#uid”.

m3jn.w (PT) " m3n.w (NK) “Bezeichnung des Westgebirges” (BD, Wb II 12 & 29) = “the Western Mountain” (FD 103) = “le Couchant (en rapport avec le Soleil)” (AL 77.1615 with PT m3jn.w; ElSayed 1987, 64) = “1. Westgebirge (wo die Sonne untergeht), 2. (lit.) Westen” (GHWb 320, cf. Zibelius 1978, 84–85). Further lit.: SAK 22, 1995, 298. ! G. Takács (1998–99, 105 f.) analyzed OEg. m3jn.w as a nomen loci (with m- pre"x) of an unattested *3jn, which could be a regular OEg. re#ex of AA *r-y-n, *l-y-n, *r-y-l etc. OEg. m3jn.w was the “place of *3jn”. Summing up my etymologies, I propose that the Western Mountain meant actually either the “place of overnighting” (*mal5n.aw) or the “place of darkness and shadow” (*ma-r5n.aw or sim.). Which of the two solutions is the correct one, remains open:
nb: This is how F. Kammerzel’s (1994, 61, n. 37) bold and purely speculative state
ment made without any analysis (“. . . eine Derivation mit prä!giertem m- . . . für m3jnw >
m3nw ‘Westgebirge’ ist . . . wohl ausgeschloßen”) breaks down.
" 1. A possibility could be identifying OEg. *3jn = Sem. *lyn/*lwn “to overnight” [GT]: Ug. ln [*lyn] G “übernachten” [ WUS #1470] = “dormir, pernoctar” [ DLU I 246] = “to sleep, stay the night” [ DUL 500], Phn. lyn [ DNWSI 575], OHbr. & NHbr. lyn qal “übernachten, die Nacht zubringen” [GB 385]. Should we postulate OEg. m3jn.w = *m[a]-l5n.aw (?) “place where (the sun) overnights”?
nb1: The attestation of Sem. *lyn ~*lwn is, however, rather limited. The GB knows
of a Hbr. attestation only. Moreover, Gesenius’ Dictionary (followed by A. Zaborski
l.c.; Gray 1934, 22) explains the Hbr. root lyn from OHbr. láyil & láyl3 “night”
as a secondary denominative verb by an assimilation of l- to n-. Acc. to DLU, this
root is attested also in Phoenician (ln). A. Zaborski (1991, 1686), in turn, gives also
a certain Ar. lwn “to spend a night”.
" 2. Eg. *3jn could be cognate with also Sem. *layl- “night”, although this possibility is semantically less suggestive (i.e., we should suppose OEg. m3jn.w to have meant something like *“place of night”), cf. Akk. l5li3tum, later l5lâtu (pl. tante) “evening” [AHW 552], Ug. ll “noche” [ DLU I 245], Hbr. láyil & láyl3 “night” [GB] !! Ar. layl- & layl-at- “nuit” [BK II 1050] !! Geez lelit “night” [Lsl.] etc. (Sem.: GB 385; Djk. 1970, 463; Rabin 1975, 88, #61; Dlg. 1986, 81, #25; Lsl. 1987, 314). The AA etymologies offered for Sem. *layl- are uncertain.
nb1: The Sem. root has been equated by the “old school” of Egypto-Semitic com
parison with LEg. nn “Finsternis, Nacht” (GR, absent in Dendera, Wb II 274, 5) =
nn & nn.t “l’obscurité” (AL 78.2126 & 2127). For this Eg.-Sem. etymology see: Erman
1892, 113; Clc. 1936, #424 (as a late loan!); Vrg. 1945, 136, #9.b.15; Chn. 1947,
183, #440; Vcl. 1958, 377; Hodge 1976, 13 (comparing Eg. nn.t “lower heaven”).
On the other hand, it should be noted that V. É. Orel and O. V. Stolbova (1992, 200)
risked a fragile comparison of LEg. nn with their WCh. *nwan- “darkness, shadow”.
m3jn.w 43



Actually, this WCh. reconstruction is based only on Dera nóonì [ Nwm. 1974, 130
& Schuh] = nôni [Kraft] and Ngizim nunuwÜ “shadow” [Kraft] = nÖnúwâ “shade,
-ow” [Schuh 1981, 120] (Dera-Ngizim: Mkr. 1987, 319), which represent possibly
a dissimilation < Ch. *r-n “shadow” (discussed below) + LEg. nn.
nb2: V. É. Orel (1995, 107, #102) combined Sem. *layl- with his hypothetic LECu.
*lul- “to slumber ((/0+)*.)” (by the way, Orel uses the classi"catory term “Galla
Somali”, which is a non-existing unity!). But this proto-form relies solely upon Somali
†-o (f ) “Schläfrigkeit, Schlummer”, l†l- “schläfrig werden, nicken mit dem Kopf
infolge Schläfrigkeit” [Rn. 1902, 277] = lúl-o (adj.) “drowsy” [Abr. 1964, 166]. Not
too convinced, semantically too vague.
nb3: In another publication, V. É. Orel and O. V. Stolbova (1988, 77) identi"ed
Sem. *layl- falsely with WCh.: Zaar lii, liil “moon”. It cannot be accepted both for
the evident semantical lapse and for the fact that this South Bauchi root has a fully
different history, cf. AA *li«- “moon” [GT] > OEg. j«% [< *l«%] “moon” (OK, Wb
I 42, 8) !!! (?) SBrb. *ta-lli-t ~ *ta-illil-t “moon, month”: EWlm. ta-lli-t, Ayr te-lli-t,
Ghat ta-illi-t, Ahaggar ta-illil-t, ta-llil-t, Azger (Adjer) ta-lli-t (SBrb.: Alj. 1980, 108;
Bst. 1883, 325; 1887, 457) !!! ECu. *le«- “moon” [Sasse 1979, 21] !!! WCh.: SBauchi
*l5 < *liH “moon” [GT]: Tala lii, Sho ( Ju) lii, Zangwal (Soor) lii, Boghom lio, var.
lyo-—, Dikshi & Bandas li-m (SBauchi: Smz. 1978, 27, #28; JI 1994 II, 238). For
the Eg.-ECu.-WCh. etymology see Takács 1997, 253, #3.8.1.
nb4: The only (and so far unnoticed) Afro-Asiatic parallel of Sem. *layl- may be
SCu.: Ma’a (Mbugu) -laGu [dissim. < *-lalu?] “evening” [Flm. 1969, 12, #28].
" 3. The most likely solution for the etymology of OEg. m3jn.w is identifying PEg. *3jn with PCh. *r-n “shade” [Schuh 1982, 14] = probably *rin- “shadow” [GT], cp. WCh.: Gwandara áwrí—ya “shade” [ Mts. 1972, 21] ! AS *r5n > *r¢n (secondary var. *rigin in Gmy.?) “1. shadow, 2. spirit” [GT 2004, 310] = *r5n [Stl. 1977] = *r[5]n “shadow” [ Dlg.]: Angas rin “shade” [Ormsby 1914, 314] = riin “the shadow of inanimate objects”, ma-riin “the shadow of animate moving objects, supposed to be essential of life, if not the life itself ” [Flk. 1915, 272, 243] = riin “Schatten (Sache)”, mà-riin “Schatten (Mensch und Sache)” [ Jng. 1962 MS, 25, 35] = riin “shadow” [Hfm.] = rin “shade, shadow” [ALC 1978, 55] = rin “shadow” [Krf.], Sura riin “Geist, Dämon, Schatten” [ Jng. 1963, 80] = riin “shadow” [Hfm.] = riyin “shadow” [Krf.], Mpn. r5in “shadow, re#ection, spirit”, mì-r5n “shadow, picture” [Frj. 1991, 12, 37], Kfy. riin “shadow” [ Ntg. 1967, 34] = riin “shadow” [Hfm.], Msr. riin ~ rin “1. shade, shadow of person, 2. spirit”, rin sekep “shade of a tree” [ Dkl. 1997 MS, 261, 271], Chip rin “shadow” [Krf.], Gmy. rûn [rün < *r¢n] “shade, shadow” [Srl. 1937, 192] = r[[n [rün] “shadow” [Hfm.] = rigin (so, -g-!) “shadow” [Krf.] = r[[n “shade” vs. r;g;n (so, -g-!) “shadow” [Hlw. 2000 MS, 30] (AS: Hfm. 1975, 21, #122; Stl. 1972, 183; 1977, 157, #182; 1987, 236, #833) ! BT *r$ni “shade” [Schuh]: Tng. riwin ~ rigin [ Jng. 1991, 137], Kir" rùnní [Schuh], Glm. rúuná [Schuh], Krkr. %ùni [Kraft] = rÜnní [Schuh], Bole rùuní [Schuh], Ngamo rùnní [Schuh], Gera rìní [vowel harmony < *runi] [Schuh] (BT: Schuh 1978, 153; 1984, 212) ! NBch. *(’a)r-N “shadow,
44 m3jn.w



shade” [Skn.] = *a-rena “shadow” [Stl.]: Warji arnái, Tsagu arné, Kariya arín, Mburku réèna, Jimbin aréná, Diri ma-rna, Pa’a árnà (NBch.: Skn. 1977, 39) (WCh.: Kraft 1981, #261; Stl. 1987, 236–237, #833) !! CCh.: Mbara rìgín “black” [TSL 1986, 276] !! ECh.: Kera gÜsáatÖrna [Stl.: *gÜsáa-tÖ-rna] (adv.) “im Schatten” [Ebert 1976, 50] ! Tumak mù-rÖÜn “nuit” [Cpr. 1975, 85] ! Mokilko dô-rnònò (adj.) “ombrageux, sombre, ténébreux”, cf. ráà—é “suie (dans les casescuisine), noir de fumée, moissisure” [ Jng. 1990, 84, 165], Bidiya ’ére— “nuit” [AJ 1989, 74] (Ch.: Stl. 1996, 31–32).
nb1: Noteworthy are still WCh.: Hausa rínà “to dye (with indigo, with henna)”,
rínè “to dye all of . . .” [Abr. 1962, 736–737] = rine “to become dark in colour”
[Stl.] ! Tangale riine “to dye” [ Jng. 1991, 137], which, however, may represent
an areal word. N. Skinner (1981, 192, #137) explained these with a query-mark
ultimately from Ar. ("an)-n5l-(u) “plante dont on tire l’indigo (indigifera tinctoria)”
[BK II 1376].
nb2: Cf. also WCh.: Tng. rim & Waja rim “darkness” (Kwh. 1990, 101) ! NBch.
*r-m-n “black” [Skn.] < *r-n-n (?) [GT]: Warji r2n-na, Miya rinni, Kariya rimina
(NBch.: Skn. 1977, 13).
nb3: Some of the Ch. forms (display an assim. *r-n " *n-n, cf. Dera nóonì [ Nwm.
1974, 130 & Schuh] = nôni [Kraft] ! Ngizim nunuwÜ “shadow” [Kraft] = nÖnúwâ
“shade, -ow” [Schuh 1981, 120] (Dera-Ngizim: Mkr. 1987, 319) !! ECh.: Bdy. nynto
(f ) “ombre” [AJ 1989, 102].
nb4: The position of WCh.: Bade rÖrwán [Lks. 1968, 223] = rÜrwán “shadow”
[Kraft] is dubious, since R. Lukas analyzed it as rÖrw-án, i.e. the was here suppos
edly *r-w-r, with suf"x -an. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded at the pres
ent that Bade *r-w-r was an assimilation from *r-w-n, thus connected to Ch. *r-n,
nevertheless (although its difference from the Ngizim form is strange).
nb5: O. V. Stolbova (1996, 31) explains ECh.: Kabalay t2n, Lele tùnò, Gabri tún.,
Somray dun etc. “shadow” from *t-urn- by the “lenition” of the medial *-r-.
" 4. E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 172) combined the Eg. toponym with Nubian (Kunuzi, Dongola) ma5n “links”, which cannot be accepted for more reasons.
nb1: First of all, in accordance with the results of Afro-Asiatic comparative linguistics,
we may safely claim that Egyptian and Nubian are not related genetically (despite
A. Ju. Militarev’s 1984 efforts).
nb2: If, in turn, we suppose a borrowing, it is almost impossible to explain how and
why the meanings shifted in case of a loanword, not to mention that in Egypt, the
notion of “West” was associated not with the left, but with the right side.
*m3« (the object depicted by the hrgl. m3«, Aa11) “pedestal (for Min,
Ptah), an indication of the earth (in the oldest times)” (Kristensen 1926, 51) = “terrace with a step” (Boeser 1932, 45) = “base, socle, piédestal” (AL 77.1585, 79.1104) = “platform or pedestal” (Brovarski 1987, 28) = “Sockel (dem Zeichen ähnlich)” (GHWb 315).
nb: Gardiner (1927, 525, Aa11) still failed to de"ne the hrgl. sign, but rightly aban
doned the old identi"cation with the #ute (m3.t) suggested by Grif"th (1898, 56)
pace Maspero, Loret, and Erman. Rejecting most of the former proposals (e.g., 1.
Champollion: “coudée égyptienne”; 2. listed by Brugsch among the musical instru
ments; 3. Loret followed by Müller 1894, 29, fn. 2 & Borchardt 1897, 104, Nr. 37:
“wahrscheinlich eine Doppel#öte, später vielleicht eine einfache Flöte”; 4. Erman:
*m3« 45



“ein Hausgerät”), Boeser (l.c.) relied with his de"nition of the hrgl. m3« on a hymn
(MK Cairo stela 20089): s0m wj mnw r 0tjw “How mighty is Min on (his) terrace!”.
Nevertheless, H. G. Fischer (1996, 229 & fn. 420–421) explained the hrgl. from a
certain m3«.t (sic) “baton, i.e., a short stick (with a variety of wedgelike form)”, and
saw in it originally “sg. straight (a straight-edge or cubit-rod?)” (i.e., a derivative of
Eg. m3« “richtig”), whose tapered variants “might be reproducing the beveled edge” (NB:
at least one species of cubit road with a beveled edge survived).
! Perhaps related to Eg. m3« “ein hölzerner Teil der Barke” (CT, Wb
II 25, 14), and also “als Teil des Sonnenschiffes: ob Bord?” (XX., Wb II 25, 1) = “Bord (e. Schiffes)” (GHWb 318). ! To the best of my knowledge, it has not been much discussed in the etymological lit. so far. In the light of its false rendering “#ute”, F. L. Grif"th (1898, 56) af"liated it with Eg. m3.t “stick, cane” (above) and tried to explain both from Eg. m3« “straight, just, true” (which
he regarded “an idea that may be connected either with the cubit rod or with the "ute”). I have two suggestions. The "rst solution seems more convincing than #2: " 1. ES: Geez m2r3« ~ m2r«3 ~ m2«r3 “earthenware tripod on which
the cooking pot rests above the "re” [Lsl. 1987, 356, 327] !!! HECu.: Burji mero ~ mera “pot-support (ring)” [Hds. 1989, 115, 212].
nb: Led by the wish to link the word to Geez mar"a “to carry” (treated in the same
lexical entry as Geez m2r3« ~ m2r«3 “leather”!), W. Leslau (1987, 356) added to
m2r3« ~ m2r«3 quite suggestively: “that is, the tripod that supports the pot”.
" 2. With respect to the etymology of Eg. ps< (suggested in EDE II q.v.), a derivation from a basic meaning “wide” might be also justi"ed. Cp. Bed. m3ra" [-" < *-« reg.] (intens.) “breit, weit, geräumig,
entfernt sein” [Rn. 1895, 172] = mir"(a) “to be wide”, mar"- “wide,
broad, ample, numerous” [Rpr. 1928, 218] = marrai “broad, spacious” [Hds. 1996, 94] !!! ECh.: Kbl. mári “weit”, Nnc. márin “weit” (ECh.: Lks. 1937, 90, 93).
nb1: N. Skinner (1995, 29) combined the Bed. ex. with SBrb.: Tuareg (sic) mar
(sic) “to be wide”.
nb2: There are parallels for the supposed semantic shift, cf. e.g. IE *plå3t- “breit
und #ach” > i.a. OIndic pÓthivñ “Erde” < “Erdober#äche”, OSaxon #et, #etti
“Fußboden im Haus”, OHGerm. #azzi, #ezzi “geebneter Boden, Tenne, Haus#ur”
(IEW 833–4).
m3« “richtig, wahr” (OK, Wb II 12–15).
! The quite diverse verbal meanings of Eg. m3« (as classi"ed in Wb II
22–23 & GHWb 317) can be summed up as follows (with additional references). From these, the original idea of Eg. m3« seems to have
been “to (be) direct(ed) in the right direction”:
(1) “1. eigentlich: richtig, in Ordnung sein” (Wb) = “in guter Richtung sein” (Pusch
1974, 20 after Junker: Giza IV 59f., 63) = “to set aright (light)” (DCT 155). Cf.
Allen 1984, 557: PT m3« adj. “in order, proper”.
(2) “2. mit Bezug auf Opfern: (MK-LP) dargebracht werden, (alt) etwas geben” (Wb)
46 m3«



(3) “3. mit Bezug auf gehen, leiten: (alt) einen Weg weisen (tr.)” (Wb) = m3« “to
set aright, direct” (PT, Allen 1984, 557) = “to lead, guide”, as a noun “leadership,
guidance” (DCT 155).
(4) “4. (BD, GR) den Arm ausstrecken” (Wb) = “3. ausstrecken (Körperteil)” (GHWb)
= “to direct (limbs, winds)” (DCT 155).
(5) “5. (old, GR) jmdn. führen, an einen Ort leiten, jemdn. aussenden” (Wb) =
“1. führen, leiten, weisen (Weg), 2. aussenden” (GHWb). The sense ‘schicken’ occurs
already in Illahun (MK, Pap. Berlin 10016, rt. 2, Luft 2004 MS, 23). Zeidler (1999
II, 251, fn. 4): m3« “zuführen” (Pfortenbuch, scene 55). Cf. also “5. hinauswerfen
(Tau aus Land)” (GHWb) = “to throw out (a rope)” (DCT 155).
(6) “6. (since NK) richtig gehen: fahren, (herbei)kommen” (Wb) = “6. aufbrechen,
sich auf den Weg machen, 7. fahren (e. Schiffes), usw.” (GHWb) = “to go straight,
lead” (Edfu, PL 395).
(7) “7. das Ziehen des Schiffes” (CT, Wb II 23, 7) = “treideln, das Ziehen von
Schiffen vom Ufer aus durch Menschen (oder durch Tiere?)” (Martin-Pardey in LÄ
VI 755, n. 4) = “4. steuern (Schiff ), paddeln” (GHWb) = “to navigate ariht” (DCT
155). For this verb cf. also SAK 13 (1986), 105, fn. 57; WD III 49. Hence: m3«
“Zugseil” (Amduat, Hornung 1963 II, 86, n. 303) = “guide-line” (AECT I 109–110,
Spell 117, n. 6: CT II 13 & AECT II 39, spell 398, n. 52: CT V 147a, cf. also CT
II 135d–e, 137c) = “cordeau” (AL 78.1610: CT II 134d & V 147a; also Barguet
1986, 354, spell 398 & Lacau in RT 30, 1908, 68, no. 43) = “cordage d’avant”
(Barguet 1986, 84, spell 644) = “(prow?)-rope in boat” ( Jones 1988, 167, #64: CT
VI 264m, cf. AECT II 220, spell 644) = “Vordertau, Zugseil” (GHWb 318).
! Hence, i.a.: (1) m3«.t “das Rechte, Wahre, Wahrheit” (OK, Wb II 18–20) = “cos
mic order” (Vergote 1971, 47) = “ordine, (propriamente) ciò che è diritto, ciò che mette (in) ordine” (Roccati 1998, 90). For a critical discussion of m3«.t de"ned by J. Assmann (1990) see Quirke 1994.
W. Vycichl (DELC 105) isolated the Cpt. re#exes in three groups: (OS) me, (SM) mee, (BF) mei, (F) meei vs. (SAL) mhe, (BF) mhi vs. (A) (a)mie, (AL) mie “Wahrheit, Gerechtigkeit” (KHW 86).

has been explained by Fecht (1960, 9, §12) with the identical pronunciation of both
m3«.t and mr “bull” in the Ptol. era. Orel and Stolbova (1992, 201; HSED #1742),
however, compared Eg. mr (q.v.) with CCh.: Zeghwana maran adj. “right” [OS],
which is probably baseless.

(2) m3«.w “(richtiger) Wind (gern mit dem Zusatz nfr ‘günstiger Wind’)”
(MK: Peasant B 1:55, Wb II 23) = “wahrer Wind” (Vogelsang) = “wind, breeze (with a nuance of good sailing wind, blowing upstream from the north, enough to "ll the sails and propel a boat or ship, but not too "ercely)” (Edfu, PL 395) > denom. m3« “segeln (mit Objekt
des Schiffes oder Gewässers)” (late NK, GR, Wb II 24) = “to sail (with the implication that this is smooth, true sailing)” (Edfu, PL 395).
nb: The derivation of Dem. mj “wind, breath” (only in the myth of the sun-eye
3:30) from this root (Cenival 1987, 3–8; cf. Manning 1991, 156) is phonologically
dubious.
! Etymology is disputable due to the various senses of OEg. m3«.
Another obstacle is the disputable origin of OEg. -3- (*-r-, *-l-, *-"-?).
nb: W. Vycichl (DELC 105) assumed the original *-r- > -3- to have been preserved
by (B) smarwout+, qual. of smou “segnen” (KHW 185, 187) < sm3« “beten zu
einem Gott, ihn anrufen” (late NK, Wb IV 125, 17–18) = “to pray to god” (CED),
but this is not evident. Although ,erný declined the derivation by Brugsch from
*smaJrwout, he (CED 152) preferred to analyze it as a secondary qual. from
*smaro < smou ero= (on the analogy of naro < nau ero=).
" 1. At the present, perhaps the most tempting seems the etymology proposed by V. É. Orel and O. V. Stolbova (HSED #1742): CCh.: Zeghwana ma%à “correct” [Kraft 1981, #287], for which cp. also ECh.: Smr. márúwè “directement” [ Jng. 1978, 205]. There exist vars. with *-l- as well in NOm.: SEOmt. *mol-o “straight” [Bnd. 2003, 110, #94]: e.g. Zayse & Zrg. mol-o [Bnd. 2003, 336, #94] !!! CCh.: Hwona mhlmhl “correct” ! Kilba mìl m5lú “correct” (CCh.: Kraft 1981, #287). The primary meaning of the underlying AA root *m-r-« ~ *m-l-« might have been “straight” [GT].
nb1: Erosion of "nal *-« in Chadic. OEg. m3« < *mr« or *ml«?
nb2: For these CCh. data cp. also Eg. mr (below) and OS 1992, 201.
" 2. G. Takács (2006, 107–8): or perhaps cf. Brb. *--mVl “se diriger vers” [Ksm.] > NBrb. *2-m2l “arriver à” [Ksm.]: Qbl. mel “arriver à, échoir” [ Dlt. 1982, 495] = 2-m2l “arriver à” [Ksm.] !! WBrb.: Zng. e-mel (sic, -l) “hingehen, sich wohin wenden” [Zhl. 1942–3, 87, 104, #34] = a-m2‰ [‰ reg. < *l] “se diriger vers” [ Ncl. 1953, 209] = a-7iy “se diriger vers” [Ksm.] !! SBrb. *2-m2l “être dans un lieu” [Ksm.] (Brb.: Ksm. 2001, 93–94, n. 7) < AA *m-l-[«] (?) with
a semantic dispersion seen e.g. with the re#exes of IE *res- “gerade (richten), (st)recken” [IEW]?
nb1: Cf. OIndic ,Ójyati “streckt sich, eilt (Pferd)”, rají- “sich aufrichtend, gerade”, Av.
raz- “(gerade) richten, ordnen”, rašnu- “gerecht”, Lat. reg. “gerade richten, lenken,
herrschen” > dirig. etc. (IEW 854–7).
nb2: As pointed out by M. Kossmann (2001, 93 & 94, n. 7), WBrb.: Zng. a-7iy
!! NBrb.: Qbl. 2-m2l may be etymologically related with Hgr. e-mel “être dans un
lieu”, which have been compared (below) with LEg. m3« “place”, which would
imply an eventual connection of both Eg. m3« roots.

" 3. GT: with special regard to the semantic shift in CT m3« “guide
line”, cf. ES: Geez mar%a & Tigre mär%a “to guide” [Lsl. 1987, 83], which was borrowed into Cu., cf. Bed. melah [-l- < *-r- reg.] “(an)führen, den Weg zeigen” [Rn. 1895, 168] = milh “to guide, go before, precede, announce” [Rpr. 1928, 216] = melah “to lead the way” [Hds. 1996, 93] !!! NAgaw: Bilin marh “den Weg zeigen, (an)führen” [Rn. 1887, 274] !! LECu.: SA marah (-h) “den Weg zeigen, führen wohin”, marã% (-%) “Führer, Wegweiser” [Rn. 1886, 884; 1890, 271] !!! NOm.: Yemsa marra"e/o “to lead” [ Wdk. 1990,
130] ! Kafa mar “guidare” [Crl. 1951, 473]. AA root vars. *m-r-«
vs. *m-r-% “to direct” [GT]?
nb1: L. Reinisch (1886, 884; 1887, 274) falsely derived the Cu. forms from SA arã%
“Pfad, Weg”. E. Cerulli (l.c.), in turn, erroneously explained the Kafa verb as a
caus. counterpart to HECu. *mar- “andare” [GT], which, however, represents a
fully distinct AA root (cf. Eg. mrr.t “street”, q.v.).
nb2: Strangely, W. Leslau (l.c.) considered the connection with Bed. melah “guide”
(suggested already by M. Bittner in WZKM 23, 1909, 146) to be “doubtful”, although
the shift of Bed. -l- vs. ECu. *-r- is attested.
! All other etymological suggestions ignore the basic sense of Eg. m3«:
" 4. GT: a semantically weaker solution would be the comparison with NOm.: Jnj. (Yemsa) m3"3r “good” [Aklilu n.d.; Aklilu-Sbr.
1993, 21] (unless its root is *ma"-) !!! WCh.: Hausa móórè “to feel
enjoyment” [Abr. 1962, 678], which might be connected rather with OEg. m«r (q.v.).
nb: Probably related (via in"x -«-?) to the AA *m-r-(y/w) “good” [GT] attested in

ma«- “1. spalten, zerteilen, 2. öffnen, 3. offen, ehrlich handeln gegen jmdn. etc.”
compared with LEg. m3« (knife det.), which is problematic. We are dealing here
with m3« (read only m«?) “to slay” (Edfu III 4:2), the simplex of LEg. m«m« (q.v.),
which is apparently a distinct root.
nb2: V. É. Orel and O. V. Stolbova (1992, 200; HSED #104) combined ECh.: Sokoro
maia with Eg. jm3 “to be kind, pleasing etc.” (OK, FD 20), which is improbable
(cf. of ECu. *-«).

" 7. A. Ember (1917, 86, #118; 1926, 303, #9, 311, #4) and M. Cohen (1947, #400): Eg. m3« ~ Ar. bari"a “to be free from guilt”,
bari"- “acquitted, innocent, free”.
nb: Phonologically untenable: there is but one regular correspondence (Eg. -3- = Ar.
-r-). This etymology was rightly rejected already by F. Calice (1936, #617).
" 8. W. F. Albright (1923, 68) sought the cognate of Eg. m3« in Ar.
bara«-at- “excellence, merit, perfection”.
nb1: Phonologically improbable: Eg. m- vs. Ar. b- are irregular. I see in this case
no motivation for an eventual change of PEg. *b- " OEg. m-.
nb2: D. Cohen (DRS 85) gives no sure Sem. etymology for Ar. bari«a “to excel,
be superior”.
" 9. L. Homburger’s (1930, 284) idea on Eg. m3« = (>) Peul mody
“vrai, bien” is perfectly wrong.
nb: By the way, this word could be an AP for Eg. mtj (q.v.).
" 10. E. Zyhlarz (1932–1933, 93; cf. also KHW 86) identi"ed the Eg. root with NBrb.: Zayan i-ma “es ist wahr” (which was originally a verbal form), now an adv. “wahrlich, wahrhaftig” [Zhl.] = i-ma c’est exact” [Lbg. 1924, 564]. See also Takács 1999, 107, #35. " 11. C. T. Hodge (1966, 45, #31) derived Eg. m3« = *mr« from a
supposed *3« = *r« (via pre"x m-) which he identi"ed with WCh.:
Hausa Ûài “life”, Ûáyá ~ Ûááyà “to give live to” " máÛááyáá “place of safety or well being” [Abr. 1962, 716, 729, 657]. Semantically very weak. In the same article, Hodge (1966, 50–51, #31) extended the Eg.-Hausa etymology to Hbr. r«y “to pasture, tend, govern, rule”,
Aram. r2«3 “to pasture, take pleasure in”, Ar. r«y “to pasture, rule”,
Geez ré«ya “to pasture, lead to” arguing that “the pastoral background
of ancient Egyptian culture also supports the hypothesis that the order of the universe is that imposed by the divine cattle tender”.
nb1: Hodge supposed to have found the cognate of Sem. *r«y without a pre"x m- in
OEg. j3« (word used in connection with the handling of calves).
nb2: For Sem. *r«y cf. rather PBoni *r3«- < PSam *r3«- “to follow” [Heine 1982, 107].
nb3: Later, Hodge (1992, 212) derived Eg. m3« “to offer” and m3« “to lead, guide”
erroneously from Lislakh (AA-IE) **b-l “to carry”!
" 12. O. Rössler (1971, 286): Eg. m3« < *mrd ~ Sem. *mrd: Syr. m2r5d
“munitus, tutus” [Brk.] ! Ar. mrd “7. être audacieux, hardi” [BK II 1088] = “beständig sein” [Rsl.].
nb: Declined already by G. Conti (1976, 52, fn. 80), J. Osing (1997, 226), and G.
Takács (2006, 107–8). The latter pointed out that the basic sense of Sem. *mrd was
rather different: “widerspenstig, trotzig, unbeugsam sein, sich au#ehnen, empören”,
which has hardly anything in common with that of Eg. m3«. O. Rössler’s examples
for the Lautentsprechung of Eg. « = Sem. *d are disprovable (cf. EDE I 346–352). Cf.
also Eg. m«r (q.v.).

Evidently, we are dealing with an inner Eg. innovation from the root m3« “reg.” (above), not a separate root with an original mean
ing *“to offer, give” (or sim.) as often erroneously suggested in the etymological literature. " 1. In Egyptian philology, explained from the verbal sense of OEg. m3« “richtig; richten” (above). P. Wilson (PL 396): a variation of m3«
“to lead” (i.e., to their recipient). F. von Calice (1936, #618): m3«
(which he mistakenly attributed solely to the GR) from sm3« “rich
tig machen”. GT: perhaps in fact *“reach sg. to s’one (darreichen)” with a semantic shift known from the re#exes of IE *res- “gerade (richten), (st)recken”?

ECh.: EDng. míirì “impôt” [ Dbr.-Mnt. 1973, 206] seems tempting, since Arb. -Ø< *-«- is reg. (Sasse 1979, 36), but, for the reasons outlined above, it
is here fully improbable.
nb: V. É. Orel and O. V. Stolbova (1992, 194) equated Eg. m3« with CCh. *mar- “to
give” (sic). But the only accessible re#ex is Chibak mari “to give” [IL in JI 1994
II, 188]. False, should be rejected. PBura-Margi *-r- is regular < PCh. *-n- (NM

nb: Evidently untenable both semantically and phonologically (only Eg. m- = Akk.
m- correspond regularly).
" 5. A. Ember (1926, 310, #2) suggested a development Eg. m3« <
*ml« < *bl« ~ Ar. bala3a “to reach”. Unconvincing. Rejected already
by F. Calice (1936, #618). " 6. C. T. Hodge (1990, 173) presented the following Lislakh etymology: LL **Nb-l: Eg. j3m [met.?] “to offer” & m3« “to present” !!!
Ar. %amala “to carry” – LL **Nb-lH: Eg. mrj “sounding-pole” (q.v.) !!! Ch. *mari “to give” (sic, cf. JS 1981, 116) etc. Further details see apud Eg. m “nimm!”.
nb: In his paper, Hodge derived the following Eg. words from an ultimate LL
proto-root **b-l: Eg. jm “give, take!”, mn “take!” (sic), mrj “sounding-pole”, j3m
“to offer”, m3« “to present”, fnfn.w “recompense (?)”, f3j “to lift, present”, tbj “to

m3« “Art Ente” (OK, Wb II 24, 8) = “a duck” (EG 1927, 464, H2) =
“sp. de la famille des ardéides” (Godron apud Vycichl).
nb: Hapax. Depicted in a mastaba (Dyn. V or VI) in the company of two other
duck species (%p and z.t), cf. Godron (1957, 20).
! Reading and existence of the word is doubtful. Seems to be a ghostword.
nb1: G. Godron (1957, 20), followed by R. Hannig (cf. GHWb 321), suggested to
read OK m3š (q.v.), which seems more convincing that m3>, since (1) Eg. m3š has
a further OK (V./VI.) ex. (ÄWb I 505), and (2) Eg. m3š [< *mrš] “duck” can be
convincingly identi"ed from an etymological standpoint, which would also justify
the existence of m3š.
nb2: The possibility (pondered in Wb l.c.; EG l.c.) of OK m3« being related to the
det. depicting the “head of a crested bird: heron (?)” (EG l.c.) in m3« “Schläfe”
(MK, Wb II 24) seems weak, since we are probably dealing with two clearly distinct
species (duck vs. heron).
nb3: W. Vycichl (1983, 106) pondered whether Cpt.: (S) me (f ) “name of a bird”
(hapax, CD 157a) represents its trace or that of a different Eg. etymon: CT m3«
“le héron cendré” (below). Finally, however, Vycichl, followed by D. Meeks (1994,
204–5, #8) proposed rather the second solution.
nb4: J. Osing (1998, 258) assumes a very late (2nd cent. AD) ex. of Eg. m3« (?) “Ente
(?)” in a papyrus from Tebtunis. The context (preceded by bn “Reiher”, rd “Art
Reiher” . . ., followed by qb < *gb “Art Gans (?)”, smn “Nilgans”), however, does not
exclude that the bird in question was identical rather with m3« “egret”.
! No suggestive etymologies proposed. G. Godron (1957, 19–20) and W. Vycichl (1983, 106) rightly separated it from the supposed Eg. *m3«.t
“héron”. Vycichl suggested a connection to Ar. mur«-at- “appartenant
à la famille des gallinacés” [ Vcl.] = mur(a)«-at- “sorte d’oiseau de la
famille des gallinacés” [BK II 1093] = mura«- “the bird so called”
[Lane 3019] and eventually with Ar. mur«-at- “graisse” [BK l.c.].
m3« 53



(*)m3«, hrgl. depicting the “head of a crested bird: heron (?)” (EG
1927, 464, H2 & n. 1) = “la tête d’un oiseau de la famille des ardéidés, appelé *m3«.t: l’aigrette” (Godron 1957, 19–20) = “un oiseau qui
porte deux plumes sur la tête, vraisemblablement une sur chaque côté” (Lacau 1970, 53) = “héron” (Vcl. in DELC 106) = “l’ardéidé, le héron cendré, image du phénix égyptien (bénou)” (Meeks 1994, 205, cf. also Houlihan 1986, 15–16).
nb: The sign is usually a (phonetic) det. (beginning from MK) in m3« “forehead”
(q.v.). This sign appears already in the OK ex. of m3« “Ufer” (from Dyn. VI,
ÄWb I 503).
! The same word may occur also in CT VI 285c as m3« (!) “heron”
(Faulkner, AECT II 231) = “heron (?)” (DCT 156 following EG l.c.).
nb1: The reading of the CT hapax has been disputed. Meeks (1994, 204):
m3«.wj.f( j), which would literally mean “celui aux deux aigrettes”. R. van der Molen
(DCT l.c.): m3«.wj. Faulkner (AECT II 233, n. 34), in turn, probably correctly
rejects the reading m3«.wj=f( j) considering (1) the dual strokes after the word as
being due to confusion with the two truth-goddesses (cf. CT VI 282ef ), and (2) the
suf"x after m3« as an error.
nb2: Osing (1998, 258) assumes a very late (2nd cent. AD) Eg. m3« (?) “Ente (?)” in
a papyrus from Tebtunis. Its context (preceded by bn “Reiher”, rd “Art Reiher”,
followed by qb < *gb “Art Gans (?)”, smn “Nilgans”), however, does not exclude
that the bird in question was identical rather with m3« “egret” or “heron”.
! Hence: D. Meeks (1994, 204) supposes a Cpt. attestation of the word: (S) me (f ) “un oiseau” (CD 157a) = “a bird named me” (Godron).
nb: This is a hapax occuring in a pun with (S) me “justice”, cf. aFnau euHalht
evaumoute eroF je tme . . . pejaF naF NCi andreas je eijerok
Ntok pHalht Ndikaios “He saw a bird, which is called ‘me’, . . . Andrew told her:
it is to you that I am speaking, (o) truthful bird’.” (the latter phrase was rendered by
Godron l.c. as “oiseau juste”, while by Meeks l.c. as “l’oiseau de la justice”).
! Etymology highly debated. Cannot be decided with certainty whether the bird’s name was an inner Eg. derivation or an inherited AA term. In any case, probably unrelated to OK m3« “Art Ente” (above) as
rightly noted by G. Godron (1957, 19–20) and W. Vycichl (1983, 106). " 1. P. Lacau (1970, 53, §125) explained the name of the bird (lit. “celui qui a deux plumes aux tempes”) via *m3« “une plume placée sur la
tempe” (cf. the feather hrgl. with the phon. value m3«, orig. “celle
de la tempe”) ultimately from Eg. m3« “Schläfe” (MK, Wb, below).
The same idea was expressed by Meeks’ (1994, 204) rendering of the exceptional instance of our word in CT VI 285c as m3«.wj.fj
“celui aux deux aigrettes”. " 2. W. Vycichl (DELC 106) identi"ed the etymon of the (S) me-bird arguing that “il est plus probable que ce soit le héron, en raison de ses aigrettes «droites» (m3«) . . .”. Note that Crum (l.c.) listed Cpt. (S) me-bird simply
under the entry for (SO) me “justice”. Similarly, D. Meeks (1994,
54 (*)m3«



204–5, §8) postulates the bird’s name to be connected with m3«
“right”, but another way: the phoenix, the “symbole de la renaissance, devient à l’époque chrétienne une image du juste”, although it is anachronistic to project this conception to the CT or the age when the script was developed. But already G. Godron (1957), without knowing the CT VI 285c ex., correctly separated the intuitively supposed etymon *m3«.t > (S) me-bird from m3«.t “truth” as terms that are purely
homonymous, but etymologically unrelated. " 3. GT: there is only one striking AA etymology to Eg. m3« [<

(1969, 31, fn. 2) suggests that the supposed etymon m3« “Kanal am
Uferdamm” was a derivation from m3« “das Ufer des Flußes” (MK,
Wb, below), while m3«.tj act. “ein Fahrwasser für die m3«.tj-Barken”
(?) < m3«.tj “Barke der Sonne” (OK, Wb II 25, 11–12). P. Wilson (PL

“to offer” (because the canal ran “straight” or because it “brought” water). Neither of these solutions is too suggestive.

to the common origin of OEg. bw & (SAB) ma & Rnd. m1l, but he believed Rnd.
-l to be an “additional element” (not part of the root).
nb1: As pointed out by M. Kossmann (2001, 93 & 94, n. 7), Hgr. e-mel “ être dans
un lieu” may be etymologically related with WBrb.: Zng. a-7iy “se diriger vers”
!! NBrb.: Qbl. 2-m2l “arriver à”, which have been compared (above) with Eg. m3«
“to direct (or sim.)”, which would imply an eventual connection of both Eg. m3«

“gerade richten, lenken, herrschen” > dirig. etc. (IEW 854–7).
nb2: L. Reinisch (1902, 294) considered LECu. *m1l- a nom. loci *ma-[w«]il-, derived
from ES *w«l “to spend the day”. Hardly so. The *-«- is not re#ected in LECu.

b2ri “place” [Skn.] (NBch.: Skn. 1977, 34) are probably unrelated.
" 8. GT: possible that the OEg. etymon of GR m3« was a nom. loci (as
intuitively surmised already by Vycichl, DELC 104 without recognizing the simplex) from a hypothetic OEg. *w3« (i.e., *wl« ~ *wr«)

" 9. GT: a relationship to CCh.: PTera *mV- “place” [GT]: Tera ma [ Nwm. 1964, 44, #323], Pidlimdi mìyà, Ga’anda mìta, Gabin mìta etc. (CCh.: Kraft 1981, #264) !! ECh.: Mokilko "ùmé “Ort” [Lks.

190] seems phonologically (unless LEg. m3« < *m«) doubtful.
nb: The initial PTera *m- is supposed to go back to *mb- = OEg. bw “place” (q.v.).
Or was PTera *mV- a distinct root?
m3« “to swallow” (GR: Hibis, Cruz-Uribe 1988, 267).
! GT: cognate with Sem.: Ar. (Dathina) ml« “avaler” [GD 2717]?
nb1: Cf. also Ar. mala«a “teter sa mère (se dit d’un petit chameau)” [BK II 1149] !!!
SCu.: Dhl. mila«- “to stick out the tongue” [Tosco 1991, 143, not in EEN 1989]?
nb2: For a different Sem. etymology (Ar. bl3 with a distinct basic sense) of the
Dathina root cf. R|&i'ka (in WZKM 27, 1913, 1f.).
m3w “neu werden, sich erneuern” (OK, Wb II 25–26) " m3 “neu” (OK, Wb II 26, 5–15).
nb: The IVae inf. root m3wj appears only from Dyn. XVIII (cf. Wb II 25) and
later in Dem. m3j “neu” (DG 148:1) > Cpt.: (SF) moui, (F)Amououi,Amouei, (F)A
mai “neu” (KHW 88), while in the earliest attestations (OK) only m3 was written.
The inf. was masc. Thus, W. Vycichl (DELC 108) and C. Peust (1999, 131) rightly
suggested Eg. )m3w “to be new”. Note that the old -w- is con"rmed also by the
supposed Chadic cognates (#1).
! Hence: m3w.t “Neuland: das neu vom Nil abgesetzte #ache Acker-land” (since Amarna, Wb II 27, 8) = “not only islands lying in the stream, but also all the lands situated between the high- and low-water marks” (H. Lyons quoted in Grd. 1948, 27) = “(doubtless really) a new island thrown up by the shifting course of the river” (Grd. l.c.) = “(lit.) ‘new land’ (that has recently emerged from the Nile)” (CED 79) = “neues Land” (NBÄ 611) = “the new land: common word for a special kind of arable land” ( Janssen 1961, 79: "rst attested under Thotmes III: Urk. IV 747:10) = “(m3w) banc de sable terre nouvelle” (Aufrère 1990, 673) = “low lying land situated on the edge of the river” (PL 400 after Yoyotte in GLECS 8, 100–1) " Dem. m3j “Insel” (DG 148, 2) " Cpt.: (SL) moue, (S) mouei,Amouie,Amou, (SB) moui (f ) “Insel, Neuland” (KHW 87).
nb1: Following A. H. Gardiner (1948, 27), J. ,erny (CED 79) surmises m3w.t to be
probably an abbreviation of *jw-n-m3w.t ‘new island’ (‘island of newness’), which
has been con"rmed by C. J. Eyre (1994, 75–76), who examined the nature of m3w.t
in detail, concluding that it denoted a genuine island only exceptionally, while
typically, it may have signi"ed (as an equivalent of Eg. Ar. gez5ra, pace Grd. l.c.)
the riverside low land between high and low water that emerged from retreating
waters, often bordering the Nile or the major seasonal water-courses or lying around
swamps. P. Wilson (PL 400), in turn, assumes that this land received a “new” layer
or silt during the #ood every year and this how it would be “renewed”. The sense
“Insel (in Fluß oder Meer)” is "rst attested in Ptol. Eg. (Edfu VI 199:2f. etc., cf. PL
400) acc. to Schenkel (1978, 62 with further discussion on the semantic history of
Eg. m3w.t), who saw in NK m3w.t the highest parts of the land most dif"cult to
water and thus brought into use as “new”.

nb2: Vergote (1959, 19): (S) moueA< *ma33wat. The derivation from NK m3w.t
has not been declined in Grd. (l.c.) as erroneously noted in Janssen (l.c.).
nb3: The etymology of the (B) place-name qmoui (Gk. <29#&7, Ar. Tem3y el
"Amd5d) is debated. W. Spiegelberg (KHW 299) erroneosly derived it from (t3)-%w.t
b3.(w). W. E. Crum (CD 161a) assumed in it a (B) *mouiA“Widder” (cf. also Smith
1978, 362), whose existence was doubted by J. Osing (1978, 189; 1985, 60, n. 11;
cf. NBÄ 489, n. 159) and by W. Westendorf (KHW 481), who, in agreement with
A. H. Gardiner (AEO II 151*), J. Yoyotte (GLECS 8, 1957–60, 100f.; GLECS 9,
1960–63, 5–9), A. Czapkiewicz (1971, 69), and recently W. Schenkel (2002, 21),
explained (B) qmoui from a LEg. *t3-m3w.t “die Insel” (Snk. l.c.: *t'3-må3w.'t).
Note that the same etymon has been assumed also for Idm$ ~ Dum$ (dumwa) by
Czapkiewicz (1971, 68) and Schenkel (2002, 20).

“barre de bois, perche” (as well as “banc de rameurs”).
! Its etymology is disputed. Most promising seem solutions #1, #2 and #3. " 1.

Nevertheless, the wtg. with the 3w hrgl. (F40) that appears only later (NK), may indicate a secondary re-etymologization of the word, which may have misled modern research.

nb2: The rendering of m3.tj (in CT I 241e) is controversial. R. O. Faulkner (AECT
I 52, spell 53, n. 5): in the version of B10Cb & B16C (p.t m3.tj) an old perf. “(the
sky) is in light” from the root m3(wj), while in B12C (p.t m m3tj) & B10Cc (p.t mm
m3tj) might be a noun “light”. DCT 157: m3w.tj (sic) “radiation”.
! Its origin is disputable. Premature to claim with certainty whether the inner Eg. or the exteneral (AA) etymology is correct. " 1. In Egyptian philology (Ceugney 1880, 6; Grapow 1914, 22; NBÄ 206), usually derived with m- pre"x from Eg. 3wj “to be long”, i.e. “those stretching out (from the sun)” (GT) = “étendu ou grand en lumière, en splendeur” (Ceugney).

1991 MS, #1014a] see Takács 2004, 208.
nb: Questionable is the etymological position of the Sem. (and henceforth Agaw)
data. It is also problematic who borrowed from whom (unless we are dealing with
a genetic parallel). M. Cohen (1947, #9), V. M. Illi'-Svity' (1971, #124), and most
recently W. Leslau (1987, 26) derived the ES forms from Sem. *"mr “to see” via
an ultimate basic meaning *“to shine, be light”. Rundgren (1963, 181–3), in turn,
assumed an opposite semantic shift: Sem. *"mr “sehen” < “hell sein, strahlen”,
which seems more convincing, cf. e.g. IE *leuk- “1. leuchten, 2. sehen”: i.a. Gk.
4!#$'7 “licht, glänzend, weiß”, Lat. l$x “Licht” vs. OIndic lókate “erblickt, wird

LEW I 823–4; KEWA III 112–3). Cf. Eg. m33 “to see” (q.v.).
! Other proposals are out of question: " 4. W. M. Müller (1893, 36): Eg. m3w (sic) “denken”, m3( j.t) (sic) “Syenitstein”, m3wj “glänzen” & “Glanz” “sind etymologisch verbunden”. Naturally they are not.
nb: Cf. Eg. m32 (orig. *m3w2?) “to think”, m32 “granite” (q.v.).
" 5. W. F. Albright (1927, 213), in turn, eqauted both m3w.t and OEg. m3wj “new” with Ar. bah3 “glänzend sein”. Unconvincing both semantically and phonologically. Querried by F. Calice (1936, #619) as “höchst unsicher”. " 6. P. Wilson (PL 400) derives (pace Osing in NBÄ 746) GR m3w “rays etc.” from m3w “to be new” (“because new things are bright”!) and assumes that m3w refers to “the renewing of life giving properties of the rays of the sun”.
m3w.t (or m3wt < *m3t?) “der Refrain eines Liedes” (NK 3x, Wb II 27, 15) = “(technical term for) repeat” (Brunner, JNES 25, 1966, 130–1) = “refrain (?)” (AL 77.1606) = “chorus, refrain (?)” (NE 2x, DLE I 207, cf. also Lichtheim in JNES 4, 193, n. 4) = “*Chor, Refrain (eines Liedes)” (GHWb 319) = “title (< announcing of the name)” (Hodge 1997, 201–4) = “Wiederholung, Erneutes, Refrain” (WD III 49).
nb: To the NK occurences of m3w.t (the Harper’s Song in Pap. Harris 500, 7:1–2;
also Med. Pap. London 18:5 & 17:2), P. Wilson adds GR ones meaning “songs,
chanted utterances” (Edfu, PL 402), whose phon. det. (W7, granite bowl), however,
suggests a different etymology (cf. m32 “to think out” below?), while in all three NK
exx. the det. is T19 (harpoon-head) occuring in NK m3w.t “Stab, Halm” (Wb).
! Origin debatable. " 1. In Egyptian philology (Wb l.c., GHWb l.c., D. Meeks in AL 77.1606, C. T. Hodge 1997, 198, PL 401–2), usually derived from Eg.
m3w.t 69



m32 “erdenken, ersinnen” (Wb, q.v.), which would logically imply that -t < -2 was part of the root (contrary to Wb’s segmentation ‘m3w.t’). The rather problematic semantic shift has, however, so far not been satisfactorily elucidated in either of the quoted proposals.
nb1: Moreover, Meeks (l.c.) assumes a relationship to LEg. m3wt “tristes pensées,
complaintes” (below).
nb2: Hodge (1997, 201–4) presumed in the case of m32 a large root family eventu
ally derived from AA *l-k (!).
" 2. The suggestive rendering “repeat (Erneutes)” by H. Brunner ( JNES 25, 1966, 130–1, cf. WD III 49) and “to renew, repeat again” by J. Assmann (quoted in PL 402) implies a derivation from Eg. m3w “(to be) new”, since the refrain begins a short paraphrase of the whole text. " 3. GT: in agreement with the rendering “refrain” (perhaps < *“the part to be repeated”), one might postulate an unattested underlying Eg. *m3 [< *ml] “to repeat (or sim.)” (of which m3.wt may be an abstract), for which one might consider AA *m-l “to repeat (???)” [GT ], cf.

Meeks (AL 79.1149), in addition, pointed out the underlying verbal root in m32 “se lamenter” (KRI II 883:3), which, if correct, de"nitely decides the question.
nb: All exx. have the W7 hrgl. (granite bowl, present also in m32 “to think”), which
also suggest this etymology.
" 2. P. Wilson (PL 401) assumed the “extra dimension” of old Eg. m32 " m3wt “thought” obtaining a negative connotation in LEg. to have arisen from confusion with m32rw “to weep for” (since CT, q.v.). Or, vice versa, should we account for an evolution of LEg. m3wt via *m3t < NK *m3tj < OK-CT m32r with a deviant orthography due to the in#uence of LEg. m3wt < old m32, the only comparable root after the extinction of old m32r?
nb: There is, however, some evidence for that the old root m32r was still known (as
m3tj) in the latest centuries of Eg. (cf. Osing 1998, 272, n. ag & fn. 1287).

! Origin debated: " 1. W. R. Dawson (1934, 135, §5) apparently suggests an etymological connection to Eg. m3t.(t) “mandrake” in the Mag. Pap. Leiden I 348, 5:8–6:1, where its “fruit” is identi"ed with the testicles ( jns.wj=fj m pr.t m3.t) and which eventually derives from OEg. (PT 1440e) m32.t “mandrake goddess” (Dawson) = “Oschur, Apfel von Sodom (Calotropis procera): ein Strauch mit großen, steifen, rundlichen, blau bereiften Blättern und viel Milchsaft” (ÄWb I 506). This theory implies a shift from OK m32.t via NK m3t.t down to GR m3wt.

nb: Dawson (o.c., p. 134) cites further exx. for mandrake conceived as testicles (a
Syr. med. MS q.v.: fruit of mandrake is compared with testicle of man; one of the
Ar. names of mandrake is “devil’s testicles”).
" 2. G. Takács (2004, 56, #345): if m3w.tj was a nomen actoris (suf"x -tj), lit. *“producer of seminal #uid”, it might be in principle etymologically connected with NEg. m3j “sperm” (q.v.)?
nb1: It would be tempting to compare also SBrb.: Ayr & EWlm. mul2y “être male,

Ghat a-mali, pl. i-mulay “étalon” [ Nhl. 1909, 158]. But these forms look rather
like m- pre"x participial derivations from Brb. *l-y “to mount” [GT ] = *d-hl$/iy
“monter” [PAM 2003, 509]. Note that C. Gouffé (1974, 371) derives Hausa ámáálì

tion from common Brb. *m-l-l “(to be) white” (cf. Bst. 1885, 180–181; Dst. 1925,

Thus, it cannot be compared with NOm. *mUl- “egg” unless there was a secondary
contamination between PBrb. “egg” vs. PBrb. *m-l-l “white”.
nb3: NOm. *mUl- should be etymologically separated from Om. *”ul-/*bul- “egg”
[GT ] (Om.: Mkr. 1987, 33) !!! HECu.: Burji bub$le “egg” [Sasse]. For details cf.
Eg. pj (EDE II 414). M. L. Bender (l.c.) reconstructed POm. *mbul “egg” for all
Om. forms. But assuming two different AA roots seems more justi"ed.

see Kogan & Stolbova 1994, 2, #15. (4) H. Abel (1933–1934, 305) compared OEg.

not borrowed, and Nub. -r vs. Eg. -Ø would be unexplained.
" 2. K. Piehl (1897, 130): originally “celle . . . qui donne”, derived from Eg. m3« “donner”. False, since the -« cannot shift into -w.
" 3. P. Wilson (PL 402) did not exclude a connection with Eg. m3w3 “die Arme” (NE, Wb II 28, 16), which she de"ned as “referring to sg. straight or strong”. Besides, m3w3 derives rather from m3w3 “Art Stock” (NE, Wb II 28, 14) = “perche, palanche” (AL 77.1610) = “carrying-pole” (NE, DLE I 207) = “Stab, Tragestange, Stange (an e. Kasten)” (GHWb 319). Plausible provided we assume OK m3w3 > NK m3wd > GR m3wt (secondarily conceived as fem. m3w.t).
m3w3 (GW for m3w, mw3, or mw?) “unbotmäßig, ungehorsam sein” (late NK, Wb II 28, 10; GHWb 319) = “être désobéissant” (AL 78.1626).
nb: The actual root might have been *mw3 [from *mwr ~ *mwl]. Wb & GHWb
read m3w3, while D. Meeks m3w(3).

From the same root derive: (1) m3w3 “Art Stock” (late NK, Wb II 28, 14) = “corniche” (Ceugney 1880, 6) = “Stab” (Wreszinski 1909, 175) = “une palanche (sur l’épaule), aux bouts de laquelle sont suspendues des bottes” (Keimer 1942, 318) = “Holzstab” (Helck 1958, 27; MWNR 857) = “Stock” (WMT 349; MWNR 852) = “perche, palanche” (AL 77.1610; 79.1126 with lit.) = “Tragstange oder Joch, urspr.: Querholz bei Pferden und Rindergespannen, auch: ein einfacher, wenig bearbeiteter Holzbalken” (Hassan 1979, 121–4, esp. 121, fn. 19–30 with a list of NK etc. occurences) = “carrying-pole, two variations: (1) carried by two men (the load hanging in between them), (2) carried by a single man” ( Janssen 1975, 385–7) = “carrying-pole” (late NK 5x, DLE I 207; Vrg. 1982; cf. also Janssen 1961, 44 and Leitz 1999, 33, fn. 13 with exx. and lit.) = “Tragstange” (Helck 1989, 140, §6) = “Stab, Tragestange, Stange (an einem Kasten)” (GHWb 319) = “balancier, palanche” (Vernus 1997, 439–441) = “type of stick, refers to a simple unworked or lightly worked length of wood, used as a stick with which to carry things like a yoke, carried in the hand and can also be used as a measuring stick” (PL 402).

VI 129) = “Brückenjochen” (ÜKAPT II 321–2) = “*Brückenjoch, *Stäbe” (GHWb
322), which Meeks read as m3w3. P. Vernus (1997, 439f.), followed by F. Junge (2003,
247, n. 417), translated m3d.w (obscure det., identi"ed by Vernus with D41 + pl.
strokes) of Pap. Prisse 13:2 (Wb II 35, 4; Baba 1956, 153–4, n. 417: “impartialité”)
as “les balanciers, les équilibres” (Vernus) = “Balancierstange, Tragejoch” ( Junge)
and linked it to PT 445d m33.w.
nb2: A. H. Gardiner (1948, 18) rendered m3w3 “stick, staff ” in Pap. Wilbour in a
"gurative sense “foundation” (following Breasted’s translation “endowment”, which
Gardiner treated as “at least approximately correct”). Hassan (1979, 121–4), in turn,
found the general sense “stick, staff ” incorrect and preferred “Joch” and hence
metaphorically “Feldbezeichnung” (on the analogy of Lat. iugum “Querholz” vs.
iugerum “die von einem unter dem Joch stehenden Gespann beim P#ügen erreichte
Leistung”). P. Vernus (1997, 439–441), however, declined the meaning “yoke” (as less
convincing) in favour of “balancier, palanche”, from which he derived the "gurative
sense “apports, revenus, fondation” (in Pap. Wilbour). P. Kaplony (LÄ I 635, n. 6)
derived m3w3 “Totenstiftung” from m3w3 “versehen” (q.v.).
nb3: Naturally, m3w3 has nothing to do with m3w.t “Schaft (vom Stock)” (q.v.)
as erroneously supposed by Brugsch (Wb 540) and P. Wilson (PL 402), cf. Müller
1893, 33 & fn. 3.

nb4: P. Vernus (1997, 442 & n. 21) sees in the hrgl. (from the 1st IMP) depicting a
man carrying a balance with the reading k3rj “gardener” (cf. Fischer 1968, 154–5)
the proof for the existence of m3w3 “balance”, cf. Pap. Sallier II 6:5–8: k3rj %r
jn.t m3w3 “le jardinier en train de porter le balancier” (cf. also Brunner 1944, 133;
Seibert 1967, 155).
nb5: W. Helck (1971, 513, #86; 1989, 140, §6) suggests a GW reading má-wad (not
ma-wa3) for NK m3w3 based upon its suggested Hbr. etymon m.9, which, in view
of the OK attestation, cannot be accepted.
nb6: Smith & Gadd (1925, 235, 4) found a cuneiform (Amarna) re#ection of *pds
n m3w3 as pi9aš ni mu"da (rendered as “the kind of box in which the m3w3 were
carried”) in a list of Eg. words (in the tablet of Ashmolean Museum from Tell el
Amarna 1921, nr. 1154, rt. 4), in which they recognized but misunderstood m3w3.
J. Vergote (1982) rendered pitaš ni mu"tu “coffre à brancard” declining the rendering
“pets carried in a cage”.
(2) m3w3 “die Arme” (late NK, Wb II 28, 16, cf. Brunner 1944, 34, text 6:5; Janssen 1961, 44).
nb1: A poetic expression (Ostr. Edinburgh 916, 9, cf. W. R. Dawson & T. E. Peet:
“The so-called poem on the king’s chariot” in JEA 19, 1933, 173, pl. 29.3). Derives
metaphorically from m3w3 “carrying-pole” as rightly con"rmed by Hassan (l.c.).
nb2: P. Kaplony (LÄ I 635, n. 6) denied the sense “Arme” (to be replaced with
“Totenstiftung”).
(3) m3w3 “gezwungen sein etwas zu tun” (late NK, Wb II 29, 1). Hence also: m3w3 “vassal (?)” (late NK 1x, DLE I 207) & “Frohnde” (XXII., Wb II 28, 15). Further details in the entry below. Perhaps via a shift of meanings “to be burdened by a duty” < “to carry on shoulder”? (4) m3w3 “versehen sein, geschmückt sein mit etwas” (late NK, Wb II 28, 17): for further details see the entry below. Perhaps via “to be equipped” < “to be burdened” < “to carry on shoulder”? ! The original meaning of the Eg. root is questionable. The origin of the strange consonant structure is also dubious. Most probable is solution #3. " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 22) saw in OEg. m3w3 a pre"x m-, but he was unable to identify the basic root (OEg. *3w3 or sim.). It would imply that OEg. *3w3 must have been a verb and m3w3 its nom. instr. So far, however, I was unable to "nd parallels of OEg. *3w3 in AA.
nb: The derivation from w3 “élever” (sic!) > w3 “stela” proposed by Ceugney (1880,
6) is certainly out of question.
" 2. Uncritically following the unchecked commentary of Wb II 28, 14 and ignoring the probable OK attestation of the root m3w3, a number of authors have erroneously presumed LEg. m3w3 to represent a foreign loan-word, whereby they treated Eg. m3w3 as a GW for mwd “carrying-pole” [ Ward] = má-wad (not m-wa3) [ Helck] = m3-wd [Snd.] (sic!) and suggested a borrowing from Can., cf., e.g., Hbr. m.9 ~ m.93 “1. Tragstange, Tragesstelle, bestehend aus mehreren dergleichen Stangen, 2. Joch” [GB 404] = m.9 “1. carrying-frame, 2. pole” vs. m.93 “1. yoke, 2. carrying-pole” [KB 555], NHbr. m.9
m3w! 77



“größere Tragstange”, m.93 “kleinere Tragstange” [ Dalman 1922, 227; cf. Levy 1924 III, 44–45] etc. This solution has rightly been rejected already by W. M. Müller (1893, 33, fn. 3).

san (1979, 121–4), Vergote (1982), Ward (1989, 76), Th. Schneider (1996, 175).
nb1: With respect to the OK attestation of its root, NEg. m3w3 cannot be a loan
word borrowed from NWSem. If there was a connection, perhaps the Can. word
was borrowed from LEg.
nb2: Th. Schneider (1996, 175), in addition, falsely combined Hbr. m.9 ~ m.93
even with Hbr. ma99eh and Ug. m9 “rod, staff, riding crop” [ DUL 602] = “Stab,
virga virilis” [ WUS #1551], although the two should be carefully separated from
one another (cf. Eg. mdw below). Similarly false is Hassan’s (1979, 121–4) derivation
of Hbr. m.9 from an absurd )md9 (sic!). Besides, in GB 404 and KB 555, Hbr. m.9
is af"liated with Sem. *)mw9 attested by Hbr. mw9 qal “wanken”, nifal “wackel,
wanken”, Palm. mw9 “Schwankung”, Ar. my9 “abweichen” (these are explained in
GB as denom. from Hbr. m.9!), which seems equally unconvincing.
" 3. G.

Geez malgam from a *lgm, which is, however, unattested. The Amh. -y- + Geez

! Exact specimen disputed. No fully satisfactory etymology. Although almost all specialists agree in presuming a derivation by a pre"x m-, the etymon *3fd is disputed.
nb: The details of its supposed etymologies were most recently discussed by F. Kam
merzell (1994), who, however, failed to consider or apparently overlooked several
pieces of the etymological literature on m3fd.t, e.g. the works by Reinisch, Jéquier,
Brockelmann, Smith discussed below.
" 1. L. Reinisch (1873, 249) combined the following parallels: Eg. b%wj “Hyäne” (sic) bgs.w “Tiger” (sic) & p30.t & m3fd.t & m3j “Löwe” ~ Teda duguli “Löwe”. Absurd. " 2. H. Grapow (1914, 6, 22): OEg. m3fd.t derived by m- pre"x. But he left *3fd unidenti"ed. " 3. G. Jéquier (1921, 146–7, also 1921, 100): probably m- pre"x + fd “4” (the additional -3-caused in his view by the initial “a” [sic!] of fd “4”) " m3fd.t meant originally “pour les quatre (membres)”. Very weak. " 4. C. Brockelmann (1932, 105, #26; cf. GÄSW #620) and (apparently independently) A. Militarev (2005, 98; also SED II 226) suggested a relationship of the supposed OEg. *3fd with Sem.: Ar. fahd- “Gepard” [Brk., cf. BK II 640] = “the lynx, lupus cervarius (a well-known beast of prey, with which one hunts, and which sleeps much)” [Lane 2452]. Militarev: “a striking semantic coincidence makes this comparison interesting in spite of only a partial similarity”.
nb1: Phonologically improbable: Eg. 3-vs. Ar. -h- are irregular. Militarev (l.c.) assumed
an in"x (!) -h- in Sem.
nb2: This proposal was apparently overlooked by F. Kammerzell in his 1994
monograph.
nb3: For further Sem. cognates see Kogan (2000, 1, #1) & SED II 225–6, who set
up PSem. *pahd- “,34"!0 53-!*"!0” (Kogan) = “cheetah” (SED).
" 5. H. Kees (1941 & 1956, 33), followed by W. Westendorf (1966, 137; cf. ZDMG 118, 1968, 249f.), M. Smith (1979, 162), and K. Kuhlmann
m3fd.t 81



(LÄ II 701): Eg. m3fd.t originally meant “die Kletterin” (Kees) = *“die Läuferin” (Westendorf ) = “the ranging (lioness)” (Smith) = *“die Rennende” (Kuhlmann), a substantivized participle derived by m- from Eg. jfd “to #ee” (XVIII., FD 17) = “to hasten through” (Smith) < orig. *3fd (Kees). Cf. also LEg. mfd [< *m3fd?] “(ein Land) durchlaufen” (GR, Wb II 58, 6) = “to travel through” (Smith) and mfd “der Dahinstürmende” (Westendorf: Edfu I 312). Dubious. No proof for NK jfd < OK *3fd.
nb: Cf. the det. of m3fd.t depicting “die senkrecht am šms-Gerät hrau#aufende
m3fd.t” (Westendorf ).
" 6. H. Altenmüller (1972, 242): OEg. m3fd.t meant actually *“die Feßlerin”, akin to MEg. m3fd “Art Armband” (CT, Wb II 29, 4), derived from an unattested OEg. *3fd “schnüren, fesseln”. Not too convincing.
nb: PT 672 22.t «3.t “die Große Feßlerin” is parallel with PT 440–441 m3fd.t
“Mafdet”.
" 7. F. Kammerzell (1994, 17–31) renders OEg. m3fd.t as *“reißende Katze” or *“reißender Löwe”, composed of m3j “lion” + fdj “ausreißen” (on the analogy of m3j-%z3). Impressive.
nb1: But the mass of AA comparanda offered by Kammerzell for Eg. fdj is more than
problematic (details discussed in the entry for Eg. fdj in EDE II, q.v.).
nb2: W. Westendorf (1966, 137) cites evidence for Eg. m3fd.t occasionally apparently
conceived as a compound. Thus, BD (Naville) 39 (var. Ba) has m3j instead of m3fd.t,
while BD 34 (Pc) has only fd.t (cat det.) as if only the 2nd component were written.
Westendorf considers the writing f3jfd.t (sic) quoted by Allen (1960, 123) as a proof
for a reinterpretation of the compound as *f3j-jfd “die von vier Füßen getragene”,
while he conceived the later var. writing mjfd.t either (1) as a pseudo-etymology mj.t
“cat” (+ fd “?”) or (2) as a derivation by m- pre"x + jfd still in use.
" 8. GT: *3fd < *rfd, perhaps cognate with WCh.: Hausa furdi “lion, wild beast” [ Robinson apud Pls. 1960, 106, #12] = húrdì < *furdi “epithet of: 1. chief, 2. lion, 3. energetic person” [Abr. 1962, 392].
nb: N. Pilszczikowa (l.c.) analyzed Hausa -di as complement (sic), not as part of the
root, which seems unjusti"ed.

re#exes apparently show no trace of a medial *-r-. Therefore, the relationship of
PCh. *m-y with SAgaw & WOmo-Tana *mar- “hunger” [GT ] can be safely ruled
out. But, in principle, if MEg. m3r was in fact a “pseudohistorical” orthography
(Müller 1909; Schenkel 1965, 115; Vycichl 1951, 71; 1983, 29: graphie archaïsante) of
OEg. *m3j < *m-"-y, we may not exclude an eventual connection with PCh. *m-y.
H. Jungraithmayr & D. Ibriszimow (1994 I, 96) mention “a remote possibility that Ch.
84 m3r



*my is related to Sem. *mny ‘wünschen, wollen’ (A. B. Dolgopolsky p.c.)”. Hardly so. There
is no match of Sem. *-n- in the Chadic root.
nb2: The semantic shift “poor” < “hungry” is attested in AA, cf. e.g. in OEg. %qr
“hungry” (OK, Wb III 174) " Dem. %qr “1. hungry, 2. poor” (DG 334) " Cpt.:
(S) HhkeA“poor” (CED 277).
m3r (T12 “bow-string” det.) “berauben von . . . (m)” (MK, Wb II 30, 5) = “berauben an (m)” (Anthes 1928, 49 after Sethe) = “to dispossess (s’one of )” (FD 103) = “verdrängen, beseitigen aus (m)” (GHWb 320).
nb: Cf. perhaps also the name of the god mj (with T12 det.) in CT 292b (hapax,
DCT 160)? R.O. Faulkner (AECT III 134, sp. 1041) sees in a var. of 3j < 3r (T12
“bow-string” det.) “Oppressor” (CT ibid.: vars. B13C, B4L, B2Bo). L. Lesko (1972,
46, n. h), in turn, interprets it as “Mummy-wrapper” (or alternatively “Equalizer”).
! Etymology debatable depending on whether the m- represents a root radical or a pre"x: " 1. In Egyptian philology (Wb l.c.; Reintges 1994, 226; GHWb l.c.), usually derived directly from Eg. 3r (T12 “bow-string” det.) “jem. verdrängen von” (MK, Wb I 11) = “to drive away from, oppress (the poor)” (FD 3) = “to dispossess” (Reintges), i.e., as verbal pre"x m-. Plausible.
nb: R. Anthes (l.c.) declined his earlier rendering for m3r “jmdn. verelenden auf . . .”
and thus apparently also its denom. derivation from m3r “wretched”.
" 2. G. Takács (2005, 169, #88): less probably, Eg. m3r (if < *m"r)
might be perhaps cognate with the re#exes of AA *m-(")-r “to rob”

this additional HECu. -g- be compared with the hypothetic PCh. *m-g-r “to steal”,
which is based on WCh.: Kir" mò3òrú-, Zaar mugùr and ECh.: Mkl. "òògrá [ JI:
< *"owgra < *"omgra < *mogra?] (while in the other re#exes an erosive process
is postulated: *m-g-r " *m-3-r " *m-H-r " *m-r). With respect to the AA data,
I suspect that -g- & -3- were in the quoted Chadic words only secondary (cf. Dlg.

cow bought with ivory” ! Ma’a mmarú “load” (SCu.: Ehret 1980, 154). Recently,
V. Bla&ek (2000, 70, #103) adopted the Bed.-HECu.-SCu. comparison, quoting an
interesting extra-AA parallel: OElam. muri- “to grasp” [Koch-Hinz 1987, 885].
The SCu. etymology seems to me semantically unconvincing. I am reluctant to
compare Kmb. mass- with HECu. *m.r- esp. because of the different vocalism.
Cf. OEg. mz(3).
nb6: M. Lamberti (LS 1997, 465) af"liated Sid. m.r- “to steal” with NOm.: Wlt.

nb: W. Leslau (l.c.) forced comparing Amh. mlml both with Akk. mll and Geez
mäl0a “to extract, extirpate”, which is unacceptable for me. Amh. mlml clearly
belongs with Akk. mll, while Amh. ml0 displays a different root (cf. Eg. mn0). Thus
explaining Amh. mlml from an orig. tricons. *ml0 (so Leslau) is baseless.

LÄ VII 464 index) = “sortes de reposoirs où l’on exposait les statues divines au cours des processions” (Chassinat in Edfu VIII introduction, p. xiii) = “summer house, pavilion, (in general) a place in which a god can appear and be seen when he is resting; small temple (such as the mammisi and pylon gate, the falcon’s temple or even the balcony of appearence and the whole of the temple building itself ” (GR Edfu, PL 404–5). Hence: Dem. m3rw “kiosk, belvedere” (Dem. Pap. Ashmolean D.7, line 4, 2nd cent. BC, Reymond 1973, 78–79 & n. 7).

PN I 263:25), in which -m3(3)nr (Wb: -m3nr, Ranke: -mnr) may be a GW for *-mll.
Similarly, the var. m33 in Pap. Sallier IV (Leitz 1994, 399: to be read m3rw) is written
just like m33 “to see” (+ D35: “arms in gesture of negation” + house det.).
nb2: For archaeological evidence as well as for a supposed m3rw in the late MK
cf. El-Sayed 1979, 180, 202.
! Etymology disputed: " 1. A. S. Chetveruhin (1990, 139, fn. 18); G. Takács (1995, 106, #4; 1995, 159): if the suggestive rendering “viewing-place” proves correct, there seems to be an etymological connection with Eg. m33 “to see” (q.v.).
nb: Eg. m3rw was usually written with the eye hrgl. (D6) accompanying also m33
“to see” as det.
" 2. A. Badawy (1956, 58–64) explained m3rw lit. “viewing-place (where Aten could be seen every day)” eventually (to be derived with pre"x m-) from Sem. *r"y “to see”, cf. Hbr. mar"eh “1. seeing,
2. appearence, 4. lustre, brilliance” [KB 630]. P. Wilson (PL 405) extended this equation (“from the same Semitic root”!) to GR m3r “likeness” (hapax, Edfu IV 279:1). Unacceptable. " 3. W. M. Müller (quoted in GB 426) explained Eg. “manra” (sic) as a borrowing from OT Hbr. mill." “Name eines Teiles der Festung

rendered also as “Bauwerk auf Terrasse und zwar an der Ost#anke des Südosthügels (Ophel) Jerusalems, der alten Davidsstadt” [B. Mazar apud Görg] = “eine besonders hervorgehobene Auffüllung, die beispielsweise die Residenz des Stadtfürsten trug, dann auch die Aufschüttung für Tempel und Palast (im Norden der (nach)salomonischen Davidsstadt) oder einfach die salomonische Akropolis” [P. Welten apud Görg 1976, 30, n. 6–7]. " 4. Following Müller’s (l.c.) idea, M. Görg (1976, 29), in turn, insists on a continuity between NK mr.w “(nicht Kanäle, sondern) Gärten vor einem Tempel” and the m3rw-“Anlagen” (which he considered as a GW for mr.w). Similarly, W. Helck (LÄ II 378) assumed a relationship of OK mr.t “Häuser mit einem Kult von Hathor und Horus” ~ NK mr.w “Gärten, die vor einem Tempel angelegt sind” and XVIII. m3rw. In addition, Görg (1978, 30) ponders whether the OT term was borrowed (!) from NK m3rw, i.e, GW mrw (Görg: act. *mallu) with an original sense “Bez. einer parkähnlichen, wohl auch mit auffälligen Bauten besetzten Anlage im Süden des solomonischen Tempelbezirks”, that is, a “Miniaturausgabe des M3rw-Jtn, ein Gottesgarten in Jerusalem”, concluding with a poetic query “lag das Paradies . . . vielleicht im Ägypten? ”. Rather problematic.
nb1: The OT term was compared by Schwally (ZDMG 52, 137) and Haupt (AJSL
26, 235 & 27, 53) with Akk. mulû & tamlû “Erdaufschüttung, Terrasse (der Tempel
und Paläste)” [GB] that has recently been rendered as m$lû “1. Höhe von Mauern
usw., 2. Anhöhe, 4. Aufstieg (Berg)” [AHW 671] = “1. height, 2. hill, high ground,
3. ascent” [CAD m 193], which would imply an eventual derivation from Sem. *«ly.
But in Hebrew, the underlying root was ml" “to "ll” (KB 584).
nb2: OK mr.t (q.v.) and NK mr.w can hardly have anything in common with Sem.
*ml", for which cf. rather Eg. mrj.t (q.v.).

“Schale, Napf ” (XVIII., Wb II 126, 11–15). J. ,erný (CED 98) and J.-L. Fournet

(l.c.) eventually (but unconvincingly) explained equally from Eg. m%. Fournet (l.c.)
rendered the Gk. mng. “récipient” (not to be deduced from Eg. m3%) as second
ary (from “mesure”) arguing that “la mesure déterminée par un contenant a pu engendrer

" 1. K. Jansen-Winkeln (1996, 34) derived it from a hypothetic Eg. *m30j (sic) “zusammenbinden”, from which he erroneously explained also two further unrelated terms, namely Eg. jm30 “(backbone with) marrow (issuing from it)” (EG 1927, 456, F39) as well as Eg. jm30.w “ehrwürdig, der Würdige (von Alten und Verstorbenen)” (OK, Wb I 82). Highly improbable. Rejected by Takács (2005, 45, #4.9). Both of the suggested Eg. comparanda are out of place.
nb1: Deriving jm30 “Wirbelsäule” < *m30 “zusammenbinden” has been sup
ported also by Osing 2001, 574. But Eg. jm30 “Stück der Wirbelsäule mit dem
hervorquellenden Rückenmark” (Wb I 81, 11) = “spinal cord” (Dawson, JEA 22,
1936, 107; DCT 36) = “moelle (aussi d’une plante) > essence” (Grdseloff 1952, 485:
inscription of Shabaka) = “Wirbel(säulen)kanal” (Grapow 1954, 58) = “Rückenmark”
(Otto: ÄMÖR II 108–110: in pun with jm30.w) = “spinal cord, spinal marrow”
(CT, FD 20) = “Rückgrat” (Hornung 1963 II, 188, n.1: Amduat) = “un fragment
de la colonne vertébrale avec la moelle qui s’en échappe” (Lacau 1970, 75, §189) =
“backbone and spinal cord” (Fischer 1983, 25, F39) has probably a fully different AA
etymology (mentioned already by W. Vycichl 1958, 404), cf. Sem. *mu00- “midollo,
cervello” [ Frz. 1964, 267, #2.37] = “brain” [SED I 169–170, #187]: Akk. mu00u
“skull, upper part” [AHW 667] !! Ug. m0 “Mark” [ WUS], Hbr. m.a% “Mark” [GB]
= m.a% “bone-marrow” [KB 567] !! Ar. mu00- “moelle, cervelle” [BK II 1071] =
mu00- “Mark, Gehirn” [GB] (Sem.: GB 413; Holma 1911, 12; WUS #1542; Frz.
l.c.; SED l.c.) !!! CCh.: perhaps Mandara mÜk0y,k0è “brain” [Kraft 1981, #37].
For Sem.-Mandara see HSED #1800. Note that Bed. míkw’ål ~ mík’ål (f ) “Mark,
Knochenmark” [ Rn. 1895, 167] !!! WCh.: AS *mwa3al “1. fat (adj.), 2. muscular,
strong” [GT ] = *mw
1a3al “fat, greasy (53/"%6)” [Stl.] (AS: Stl. 1972, 184; 1977,
156, #140; most detailed: GT 2004, 256) seem to belong here with an extension *-l
(or suf"x *-al as proposed by LS 1997, 459). Should we assume AA *m-"-l “marrow,
grease” [GT ], whence Eg. jm30 [*j-ml0?] may also derive?
nb2: On the other hand, the way JW (l.c.) reinterpreted the basic sense of Eg. jm30
as “materiell versorgt " angesehen” < orig. “(in die Wirkungssphäre eines Gottes)
eingebunden” (< *m30 supported also by P. Vernus 2000, 180, fn. 91) is also highly
uncertain. Beside its rendering “als Bez. der Totenversorgung” (Gdk. 1966, 47, fn.5,
cf. Helck, MDAIK 14, 1956, 69f.) = “attaché à, solidaire de” (Lacau 1972, 48, nr. 2),
the former understanding of jm30 is also maintained: e.g., “être favorisé” (Vernus)
= nb-jm30 “possessor of reverence, venerated state” ( Jones 2000, 478, #1778),
which is supported also by the external evidence:
(1) E. Zyhlarz (1934, 115–6) linked Eg. j.m30 via metathesis [< *j-mr0 < *j-m0r] to
Brb. *m-3-r “être grand, vieux, notable” [ Dlg.], for which, cf., e.g., NBrb.: Wargla

(2) W. Vycichl (1958, 404), in turn, combined Eg. jm30 [perhaps < *j-m"0?] with
Sem.: Geez "m0: "amm@0a “salutavit”, "amm@03 “osculum salutatio, munus, donum,
munera (venerationis causa oblata)” [ Dillmann] = “to greet, salute, worship, revere,
pay respect to” [Lsl. 1987, 23]. Cf. also Eg. m0 “jem. ehren” (MK, Wb, q.v.).
(3) Or, less probably, cf. CCh.: PLamang *m-l-0 [-l- < *-r- poss.] “old” [GT, cf.
Büchner 1964, 41–42; Wolff 1971, 65, 69, 71; Mkr. 1987, 279] !! ECh.: Bdy. muràk
“vieillir, s’user”, múrkò “vieux, ancien, âgé” [AJ 1989, 101]?
" 3. GT: the etymon *m30 ~ *ml0 “to bind” to which Eg. m30 “Korngarbe” might indeed in theory be traced back has perhaps in fact Cpt. evidence overlooked by Jansen-Winkeln (l.c.): (SL) moulH, (B)A molJ etc. “zusammenfügen, verbinden, befestigen, einhüllen”, (B) moulJ(t) “Verbindung” (KHW 91). For the re-appearence of old *l > Eg. 3 > Cpt. l see Satzinger 1994.
nb: The Cpt. verb has been usually traced back to Eg. mn0 “(einen Halskragen,
Perlen auf einen Faden) aufziehen” (OK, Wb, below), but its basic mng. is debated.
Thus, for Eg. *ml0 cf. also (or instead?) AA *m-l-0 “to bind (?)” [GT ] > NBrb.:
Mzab ta-m3il-t [met. < *-mli3-?] “collier formé de tout petits coffrets” [ Dlh. 1984,

1980, 344, #17].
" 2. GT: alternatively, m30 could be also a var. to an unattested Eg. *m3g, which, in principle, might be regarded as extended by pre"x m-, cf. Eg. 3gg.t “gerbe de tiges de lin” (OK, AL 78.0107) = “Garbe (der Flachsstengel)” (GHWb 16; ÄWb I 21: VI., hapax). " 4. GT: most probably OEg. m30 < *mr0, cognate with Sem.: perhaps Yemeni Ar. mar%-ah [irreg. -%-?] “heap of corn”, mer%5 “bunch of bananas” [Piamenta 1990, 463] !!! NAgaw *mu[0]r-, met. < *mur0- (?)

Lele mòr‰ò [-‰- < *-g-?] “botte (ensemble)” [ WP 1982, 64].
nb1: The Eg.-Hamir comparison is not problematic. Eg. -0 = PAgaw *0 & *3,
which are regularly re#ected by Hamir zero (Apl. 1984, 51). As D. Appleyard (p.c.
on 20 April 1999) con"rmed to me, Hamir m%r-3 could conceivably derive from
a PAgaw *mur[3/0]-, but it could equally derive from PAgaw *mut[3/0]-. He has
also con"rmed that the Hamir word has no parallels in Bilin, Qemant, and Awngi.
Another etymology for Hamir m†r-3 could be HECu. *mut- “to sprout” [ Hds.
1989, 418], which is semantically improbable.
nb2: A striking parallel appears also in Akk. (aAK, a/jB) bira00u ~ biri00u etwa
“Bund (von Gemüse u.ä.)” [AHW 128] = “botte (de légumes, etc.)” [ DRS 83:
isolated], whose b- is, however, hard to explain. In view of its OAkk. attestation,
bira00u ~ biri00u can be hardly a Hurr. loan (cf. -00u).
nb3: The origin of LECu.: Som. perhaps máraq (m) “Werg zum Verbinden des
Euters der Kamelstute, um das Fohlen am Saugen zu verhindern, der Zitzenstrick”
[ Rn. 1902, 302] is uncertain.

PEg. *% > OK 4 discussed in EDE I 171–3).
nb2: Ernštedt (1953, 156) explained Gk. ?2FI6 “cuire à l’étouffée” from Eg./Cpt.,
which is clearly false with regard to its convincing IE etymology (Boisacq 1916,
886–7).
! Its etymology is still obscure. " 1. G. Takács (EEC): the only (both phonologically and semantically) plausible cognate is found in WCh.: PAngas *mwalak > *muluk “blister caused by burning” [GT 2004, 257]: Angas mulk ~ mwalk “a blister caused by heat”, mwalk “the skin all burnt off by "re (as by one falling into it)” [ Flk. 1915, 247, 249] = mwTMlk “to get burned” [ Jng. 1962 MS].
nb: The correspondence of Eg. 4 ~ 0 vs. AS *g & *k is regular. We may not,
however, exclude a derivation of the Angas root from AA *m-l-k “scar, ulcer”

Ceugney (1880, 7) combined it with Eg. m03j “action de brûler” (XX., q.v.), which he considered as the “forme complète” of Eg. m34 and derived from 0«w “bûcher”. False.
" 4. F. Hommel (1907, 383, #4): Eg. m34 ~ Ar. m3r “to be red”. Unacceptable both sematically (“red” vs. “to burn”) and phonologically (Eg. -4 vs. Ar. -3- are irregular, normally Eg. 4 = Ar. ~ 0). " 5. A. Ember (1911, 88), followed by W. Czermak (1931, 101) and F. von Calice (1936, #521), linked Eg. m34 to Ar. mar0- “2. sorte d’arbre (cynandum viminale) dont le bois, frotté contre celui de l’arbre” [BK II 1088] = “a tree used for striking "re” [Ember] = “Holz zum Feuerbohrer” [Clc.].

nb1: Ar. mar0- is act. “ein Baum, durch dessen Reiben man Feuer gewinnt” [Clc.] =
“wood, used to kindle "re by friction” [KB 634], and comes from the root mara0a

“thighs” (AEO II 242*), which has been rightly abandoned in most of the standard
dictionaries. Nevertheless, R. Caminos (1954, LEM 129) explained m3s.t “shoal” in

1974, 195] could also belong here. This possibility is, of course, irrelevant as to
the “short” wtg. of Eg. m3 (sic) “knee” (cf. RdE 1, 1933, 62, b; WD I 83), which
must be purely an orthographical problem. Note that, in principle, a hypothetic

connected Ma’a “knee” to Irq. mondoroq-at- “to slither, move in the fashion of a
snake” < SCu. *m.do=- “to bend ( joint of body)”, which seems unconvincing both
phonologically and semantically.
nb3: Eg.-MM *m-l-s “knee” [GT ] should be presumably distinguished from AA
*m-s-l “thigh” [GT ] represented by the isogloss of LEg. mnz.t (act. mns.t) [< *msl

Thausing (1932, 292, fn. 1): OEg. m3s “to kneel” and %msj “to sit” are of common origin (%msj was supposed to contain a %- pre"x). Cannot be accepted for several reasons.
nb: Semantically (“to kneel” vs. “to sit”) not as problematic as phonologically: the
OEg. root for “to sit” was not OEg. *%m3sj as Sethe’s hypothesis would require). In
m3s.t 101



spite of Sethe’s etc. unconvincing idea, the presence of the %- pre"x in Eg. %msj “to
sit” cannot be ruled out, cf. CCh.: Masa (Banana) mús3 “to sit down” [Brt. 1995,
218], which shows not even syllabic trace of an initial *%V- (i.e. *Vmús3 or sim.).
This Eg.-Masa comparison, however, can by no means justify the false derivation
of OEg. %msj from OEg. m3s.
" 3. P. Lacau (1970, 3, fn. 1 & 133, §356) saw in Eg. m3s.t a nomen instr. of Eg. 3s “se hâter” (MK, Lacau) = “to hurry, #ow fast (of water)” (FD 5) = “eilen, #ießen” (Wb I 20). Semantically evidently wrong. The etymological connection of “foot, leg” ~ “to run” would be in principle plausible, but it is not at all valid for “knee”.
nb: Westendorf (1987, 461, fn. 14) declined Lacau’s idea arguing that the deriva
tion m3s < 3s should have taken place before the shift of OK z > MK s, which is,
besides, ill-founded, since Westendorf ’s OK *3z is not attested (ÄWb I 18: the "rst
ex. originates from the 1st IMP written with -s).
" 4. C. T. Hodge (1976, 20, #51) speculated whether the m3- of OEg. m3s.t could be related to the "rst two root radicals of Sem. *birk-“knee” [ DRS 84]. Out of question.

Sem. *-k).

Westendorf (1987, 460–1) explained Eg. m3s.t from the primary sense “Stütze, Träger” derived from a hypothetic (unattested) Eg. *w3s “heben, tragen, erhöhen”, whose existence he tried to demonstrate on equally certainly mistaken parallels (q.v.). " 7. Ch. Ehret (1995, 313, #603) analyzed Eg. m3s “to kneel” as a re#ex of AA *-ma/i"- “to bend, fold (tr.)” extended either by a “non
"nitive” suf"x *-š or a “fortative” suf"x *-). Baseless.
nb: Ehret equated Eg. m3s.t with SCu. *ma"/«- “to bend, fold” !!! NOm.: Mocha

lists of aprons among leopard (b3-šm«), gepard (n2r.t), lynx ( jnb), jackal (wnš), (5) a
possible connection with *ms (hrgl. depicting “drei Fuchsfelle”). The latter one is
certainly false as )msj + )m3s. Moreover, Leitz failed to explain how then m3s can
go in teams (Gespann) in the NK (Caminos 1956, 32) and ignored the CT evidence
speaking in favour of a horned mammal (cf. Edel 1975, 29).
102 m3s ~ m3s.t



! The instances of (possibly) the same (?) word are as follows (this list is not complete, for some further exx. cf. PL 408): (1) m3s.t (Dyn. III) rendered by J. Kahl (etc. 1995, 249) ambiguously: “Antilope(nfell)” (cf. below).
nb: Osing (1998, 122, fn. 548) and Leitz (l.c.) equally abstained from rendering
the recently found new instance from Balat, Dakhla (late OK, cf. Posener-Kriéger:
“Les tablettes en terre crue de Balat”, in: Bibliologia, Elementa ad librorum studia
pertinentia 12, 1992, 45). D. Meeks (2005, 245, #505c) is uncertain whether this
animal is identical with that known from later sources.
(2) m3s.w (CT VI 241a, sg. despite the pl. strokes) “unidenti"ed animal” (AECT II 208, spell 624, n. 6) = “taureau (au poil roux)” (AL 78.1640) = “(wahrscheinlich) Fuchs” (Leitz 2000, 275) = “antelope, gazelle, or bull (?)” (DCT 158). Cf. also m3s.w “Masu-Tiere (des Onuris-Tempels)” (1st IMP, ÄWb I 82, not listed on p. 505, cf. Meeks 2005, 245, #505c). (3) m3s (BD Naville 84:6) “e. Tier von roter Farbe” (Wb II 33, 2) = “red deer” (Allen 1973, 72) = “taureau sauvage” (Barguet 1967, 122) = “red animal” (PL 408). (4) m3s.t (Memphis stela of Amenhotep II, line 11, cf. Urk. IV 1304:6, with pl. strokes, but sg., no det., published by A. Badawy in ASAE 42, 1943, 1–23 & E. Edel in ZDPV 69, 1953, 97–176) rendered as “Art Gazelle, Hirsch, Antilope” (Keimer, BIE 30, 1948, 119f.; cf. Vikentiev, BIE 30, 1948, 266f.) = “ein rotfarbiges Tier” (GHWb 321).
nb1: Badawy (ASAE 42, 1943, 14, n. e) identi"ed it as a rare wtg. of NK msj.t (nt
ssm.t) “Füllen” (XVIII., Wb II 140, 15).
nb2: R. O. Faulkner (AECT II 208, spell 624, n. 6) conceived it as fem. pl. (m3s.
wt) for of m3s.w in CT VI 241a (above).
(5) m3s (text of the “Sporting King”, XVIII.) “unidenti"ed mammal (was red, go in teams perhaps pulling the divine bark in the feast of Sokar?): could be Typhonic animals of some kind (donkeys?)” (Caminos 1956, 32 & fn. 5 with further lit.) = “taureau (au poil roux)” (AL 78.1640) = “(team of ) ox(en pulling the bark of Sokar)” (Brovarski, LÄ V 1069, n. 69) = “donkey” (Westendorf 1989, 80 after Caminos) = “ein Rind (roter Farbe)” (GHWb 321) = “ein Tier von rot(braun)er Farbe, das im Gespann eingesetzt werden kann” (Osing 1998, 122, n. i & fn. 549).
nb: Caminos (l.c.) speculates about a connection with CT I 289c mz.t “horned
animal” (reading debated, cf. DCT 161), which is rightly considered in PL 408
as improbable (cf. the entry for mjz.t below). D. Meeks (AL 78.1639) speaks of a
“confusion” of the two terms.
(6) m3s.t (Edfu V 270:1), var. m3s.tj (Edfu V 219:2) “taureau (au poil roux) comme épithète d’Horus” (AL 78.1640) = “ein Tier” (Kurth 1994, 12, §49: Edfu) = “animal (deer?) with red colour (fox?)” (PL 408: Edfu).

" 2. W. Westendorf (1987, 461, fn. 16; cf. also 1989, 80), in addition, extended this etymology to a derivation from a hypothetic Eg. root *w3s “heben, tragen, erhöhen” (!), from which he eventually explained a number of etymologically certainly unrelated Eg. terms such as

*ms “Dreierbündel von Fuchsfellen” (q.v.), msj “gebären” < orig. *“tragen, hervorbringen” (q.v.), and m3s.t “knee” (q.v.). Similarly, Ch. Leitz (2000, 275) assumes a connection with the Eg. hrgl. ms (F31) de"ned as “drei zusammengebundene Fuchsfelle” (Borchardt, ZÄS 44, 1907, 75–76 & Ranke, ZÄS 45, 1908, 92). Excluded, since )msj + )m3s. " 3. S. Smith (1933, 155) pondered a connection to Eg. m3s.t “knee”, since “the word m3s.t would suggest that it was a knee-length skirt or apron”. At the same conclusion arrived E. Staehelin (1966, 35) too: “es ist möglich, daß . . . m3st . . . ein Kleidungsstück . . . [ist], das nur bis zu den Knien reicht ”. P. Kaplony (IÄF 328), albeit with a query-mark, repeated this equation, although already Smith (l.c.) himself a priori declined this assumption, because some representations show the m3s.t much longer, which has been con"rmed also by E. Edel (1975, 29, §34): “nicht zu halten, da das Gewand auch länger als knielang ist ”.
" 4. GT: the external evidence is also not too helpful. Cf. perhaps NBrb.: Mzab LMS: a-l2msu, pl. i-l2msa ~ met. var. a-m2lsu, pl. im2lsa “peau tannée servant de sac” [ Dlh. 1984, 106, 118]?

Ceugney (1880, 6) saw in m3s.t an m- pre"x + s.t “endroit, lieu, place”. False both on semantic (“place” vs. “shoal”???) and phonological grounds (since s.t + *3s.t).

unjusti"ed.
" 3. Similarly, W. Westendorf (1987, 460–1, fn. 16) explained “Sandbank” (lit. *“Bank”) from his hypothetic *w3s “heben, tragen, erhöhen” (!), from which he eventually derived a number of etymologically certainly unrelated Eg. terms such as s.t (*3s.t) “Sitz”, *ms “Dreierbündel von Fuchsfellen” (q.v.), msj “gebären”, orig. *“tragen, hervorbringen” (q.v.), and m3s.t “knee” (q.v.).

m«q “brochette (Grillspieß)” (since OK, below). (3) Ignoring this and overlooking the
OK attestation of m«q, J. Hoch (1994, 170–1, #227) treated both aforementioned

nb: The reading of the Anlaut is debated. H. Brugsch (1891, 129) saw before the

P. Barguet (1953, 25) reconstructed an initial %- lost because of the break in the stone.
Henceforth, J. R. Harris (1961, 118) is of the view that “a reading %m3ky may . . . be

R. Hannig (GHWb l.c.) too put after m3gf a question-mark.

nb: The hypothetic Berber etymology would also speak for Eg. m3g (with suf"x =f )
as suggested by Faulkner. In principle, Eg. m3g could derive from *3g or *w3g or
*j3g. But common Brb. *k vs. Eg. g are irregular. From the viewpoint of this Eg.-Brb.
etymology, most noteworthy are two facts: (1) Zng. -g- < *-k- (cf. the irregular Eg.
-g < *-k?), (2) the met. in SBrb. *l-k-w < *k-l-w (cf. Eg. *m-lg < *m-gl?).
m3t.t “eine Nutzp#anze, die besonders im Delta, am Ufer, und in der Wüste vorkommt” (Med., Wb II 33, 11–15) = “curcuma” (Brugsch) = “céleri cultivé (Apium dulce Mill.)” (Loret 1894, 4–11, esp. 7 & 11, §1) = “wild celery” (Blackman 1910, 120, n. v) = “céleri cultivée (Apium graveolens L.)” (Keimer 1924, 39–40) = “carthame” (Deny 1948–51, 13–14) = “une plante de la famille des ombellifères: céleri cultivé (Apium graveolens L.)” (Lefébvre 1955, 208–9, §6) = “Sellerie/ Petersilie” (WÄDN 216) = “le persil (Petroselinum crispum)” (Darby & Ghalioungui apud AL 77.1628) = “celery (Apium graveolens)” (Germer 1979, 92–99; 1985, 137; 2002, 60, so also Ebbell quoted in WÄDN 217; PL 409; Manniche 1999, 76–77) = “soit le céleri Mill. (i.e., Apium graveolens, L.), soit le persil (Petroselinum crispum, Apium petroselinum, L.)” (Aufrère 1986, 10) = “*Sellerie” (GHWb 322).
m3gf – m3t.t 109



nb1: Since parsley can be "rst attested only in Ptol. Egypt (as a medicinal herb),
R. Germer (1985, 137) excluded identifying m3t.t with parsley.
nb2: Vocalized as *m'3ñt.'t (Edel l.c. excluding an etymon *m'32."rj't yielding in
principle a PCpt. *Àt!je) = *m'3ñt.'t > *em35t't (Peust 1992, 122).
nb3: Should be carefully distinguished from Eg. m32(r).t “Baum oder Gesträuch
Calotropis procera (mit Doppelfrüchten)” (PT 1440e, CT, Edel, q.v.) as correctly
pointed out by F. Daumas (1957, 59–66), E. Edel (1969, 12–13, n. e), and S. Aufrère
(1986, 10). This differenciation is sometimes possible only in the light of context,
since the distinction of old -2- vs. -t- disappeared by the MK. For further discussion
of the frequently confused m3t.t vs. m32.t cf. also Kákosy 1971, 164, n. v. For m3t.t
smsm.t in Pap. Ramesseum III 26 see Barns 1956, 19, n. 26. Note that m3t.t in
Pap. Leiden I 348, 5:8 has been rendered “mandrake” (Edel l.c.). Med. m3t.t has
been identi"ed by Dawson ( JEA 19, 1933, 133–5, §5 followed in FD 103) falsely
as “mandrake” and traced back to PT 1440e m32.t (q.v.) just as Blackman (1910,
120, n. v), which was rightly rejected already by Lefébvre (1955, 208) and Germer
(1979, 93) and ignored in WÄDN 216–7. On the other hand, Aufrère’s (1986, 4
& 9, XI) m32.t (sic, -2-!) “céleri” (sic!) is equally false, since m3t.t “celery” has no
attestation older than Med. (WÄDN 216). For further details cf. also the entry for
Eg. m32.t “mandrake” (q.v.).
nb4: The expression m3t.t n.t sw.t in Pap. Budapest 51.1961, rt. 2:4 was mentioned
already by Dawson (1934, 137) as “cannot be commented”. It was equally left
untranslated by Kákosy (1971, 161, 164, n. v), who pondered two alternatives: (1)
either a mistake for m3.t n.t sw.t “Halm der Binse”, or (2) m3t.t n.t. sw.t as a not
yet identi"ed species of “celery”. Since sw.t “Binse” would make little sense in the
latter case, the "rst solution is to be preferred with Dawson (l.c.), who, however,
baselessly surmised that m3t.t was “originally the name of a speci!c plant” and then “may
have become a generic term for magical plants of various kinds . . .”.
nb5: Aufrère (1986, 10, fn. 2) considered (contra Goyon 1984, 81–82, cf. AEB 84.303)
LEg. m3 (Wb II 11, 10, Mariette: Dendara I 72c) as “une écriture fautive pour” m3t.t,
which in Dendara “servait de phylactère à la déesse Hathor de Dendara” and “désignait le
céleri et non le calotrope” (i.e., it is = m3t.t + m32.t, q.v.).
! Occurs also in the following compounds:
nb: R. Germer (1985, 137) assumed in m3t.t 03s.t and m3t.t m%j.t “nur unterschiedliche
Herkunftbezeichnungen, aber nicht zwei verschiedene P"anzenaerten” as Loret and Lefébvre thought.
(1) m3t.t m%j.t “persil (Apium petroselinum L.)” (Loret 1894, 11, §4, followed by Jonckheere 1944, 18, fn. 4 & 19, fn. 2) = “Apium dulce Mill. (?)” (Keimer 1924, 39–40, so also LÄ II 521) = “céleri du Nord, une variété propre au Delta, peut-être: Apium dulce Mill.” (Lefébvre 1955, 208 contra Loret) = “céleri cultivé” (Aufrère 1986, 4).
nb: Dawson’s (l.c.) rendering “Mandragora autumnalis Bertol. (of the Mediterranean
region)” for m3t.t m%j.t is false.
(2) m3t.t jd%.w “céleri sauvage, ache de marais (Apium graveolens L.)” (Loret 1894, 11, §2). (3) m3t.t 03s.t “Crithmum pyrenaicum Forsk.” (Loret 1894, 11, §3) = “céleri du désert, persil (Apium petroselinum L.)” (Lefébvre 1955, 208; so also Keimer 1924, 39–40 & LÄ II 521) = “céleri sauvage” (Aufrère 1986, 4) = “Sellerie des Berglandes” (HAM 838) = “mountain celery, parsley: Apium petroselinum L. (?)” (Manniche 1999, 78).
nb1: Cf. Lat. petro-selinum “selinum des rochers ou des pierres” (DELC).
nb2: Dawson’s (l.c.) rendering “Mandragora of"cinarum L. (common to Syria and
Palestine)” for m3t.t. 03s.t is false.

MK m3t (falsely conceived as fem.) to Dyn. XX m3 (Pap. Harris I) ~ m3jw (Pap.
Torino, under Ramses IX).
! Hence: m32 “Granitschale” (IÄF 281: 1x also mj2) = “Salbvase” (Pusch 1974, 20 after Junker: Giza X 155) > m32 “granite bowl” (CT VII 18b, DCT 158).
nb1: The root m32 (or m3w2?) was written with the hrgl. representing a “heart
shaped vase (not heart)” (Platt 1909, 173) = “granite bowl” (EG 1927, 512, W7) =
“ein #aches bauchiges Gefäß mit zwei Henkelösen” (Sethe 1933, 17).
nb2: Following K. Sethe (1933, 13), J. R. Harris (1961, 72) supposed an opposite
way of derivation, i.e., that the name of the stone derived “from that of a particular
type of vessel of which granite was the characteristic material”.
! Etymology debated. " 1. According to the traditional Eg.-Sem. etymology, it was met. of *m23 < *mkr being akin to Sem. *mkr “to be red” [GT ]. Improbable. Cf. rather Eg. mkrr (below). Besides, it is doubtful if the original meaning was “red” and it was expressed by a root unattested in Eg. with this sense.
lit. for Eg.-Sem.: Alb. 1918, 230, #48; Ember 1930, #3.b.45, #10.a.12, #22.a.21;
Clc. 1936, #622.
nb: Attested in Akk. (aA, jB) makrû “rot” [AHW 590] !! Syr. mkr “schwarz sein”
[Brk. apud Clc.] !! Ar. makira “être rouge”, makr-, pl. mak$r- “terre rouge avec
laquelle on marque en rouge”, mumtakir- “marqué de terre rouge” [BK II 1138]
= makira “to be red”, IX “to be red”, makr- “red (noun), red chalk” [Ember].
May be cognate also with CCh.: PMusgu *m-k-l “red” [GT ]: Musgu m ́kel1 (m),
makalaí (f ) “rot, braun” [Krause apud Müller 1886, 400 & Lks. 1941] = mekelé
“rot” [Lks. 1937, 142] = mekele “weiß” [ Decorse apud Lks. 1941, 67] = m\k\l\
“rouge” [ Mch. 1950, 37], Kaykay mékélé “rot” [Sgn.-Trn. 1984, 26], Puss mekele

o- < *m-?] “rot” [Lks. 1937, 99]? Perhaps, with special regard to Ar. makr-, SBrb.:
EWlm. & Ayr ta-7r2k ~ ta-72r2k (via met.) “1. marque de propriété (faite au fer
rouge), 2. fer à marquer, fer rouge” [PAM 1998, 222] should be also compared. As
con"rmed by K.-G. Prasse (p.c., 6 August 2006), the Tuareg form is not a French
loan (not indicated as such in PAM l.c. either) but rather “it should be a genuine
Tuareg word, although it seems to be an isolated word with no other words akin
to it of the same root”.
" 2. GT: although Eg. m32 < *mlk is fully plausible, a comparison with AA *m-l-k “clay” [GT ] > Ar. mil3k- “4. boue” [BK II 1152] !!! WCh.: Angas mwalk “clay (for building houses, pots, etc.)” [ Flk.
m3& 115



1915, 249] = mwàlk “clay” [ Jng. 1962 MS, 27] ! Dwot (Zodi) mulkut “clay for pottery” [Caron 2002, 210] would be semantically rather problematic. ! Other suggestions are out of question: " 3. W. M. Müller (1893, 36) erroneously assumed an etymological connection to m3w (sic) “denken” (see m32 below) and m3(wj) “glänzen, Glanz” (see m3w.t above). " 4. V. É. Orel & O. V. Stolbova (HSED #1758; Orel 1995, 152, #1) combined Eg. m32 with Sem.: Akk. mekku ~ mikku (Ugarit, nA) “ein Stein” [AHW 642: of unknown origin] = “a type of (raw) glass” [CAD m2, 7]. False.
nb: In the theoretical and very improbable case if LEg. m3kj (hapax, q.v.) were to be
read mkj (and not *%m3kj < %m3g.t), it might be compared with Akk. mekku ~ mikku
“ein Stein” [AHW ], which breaks down also because of the CAD rendering.
m3t (originally m3wt?) “1. erdenken, ersinnen, 2. bes. auch vom Ersinnen eines Namens für jem., 3. den Namen verkünden, 4. jem. mit (m) Namen benennen” (OK, Wb II 34, 17–21) = “von der Namengebung: benennen, (den Namen) nennen” (Sethe 1928, 22, 57) = “Namen bestimmen” (Sethe 1933, 18, fn. 61) = “to excogitate” (AEO II 286 index) = “to proclaim” (CT I 141, Urk. IV, BH: FD 104; DCT 158) = “(be)nennen” ( Junge, LÄ II 885) = “concevoir par la pensée” (DELC 127) = “1. erdenken, ersinnen (auch einen Namen), 2. sich vorstellen, 3. verkünden (Namen, Bezeichnung), 4. benennen (mit Namen)” (GHWb 322) = “to pronounce (in the ritual endowment of s’one or s’thing with a name and its attendant attributes) “ (Hodge 1997, 200) > LEg. m3wt ~ m3jw ~ m3w (AEO II 286 index: m3j) “to think, imagine” (XIX., DLE I 208) " Dem. mwj “denken” (DG 156) " Cpt.: (SAL) me(e)ue, (S) meeu (rare), (B) meui, (A)Ameoue, (F) mh(h)oui,AmeeueiA“to think” (CD 199; CED 95) = “denken, überlegen, merken, vorstellen” (KHW 106) = “penser, ré#échir, s’imaginer” (DELC 127).
nb1: On the basis of the LEg., Dem., Cpt. re#exes, several works (Wb; GHWb;
PL; Hodge l.c.; Peust 1999, 151, etc.) postulate a root *m3w2 vocalized as *m°3w'2
(Fecht 1955, 396, fn. 4) = *mí3VwtV (Peust l.c.). W. Vycichl (1983, 127) regarded
the appearence of -w- in NEg. m3wt etc. surprising and the Cpt. re#exes dif"cult
to explain, since normally, *mi3we2 would yield (S) *maiue, (B) maiui.
nb2: K. Sethe (1933, 18, fn. 61) categorically declined the connection of old m32
“Namen bestimmen” to LEg. m3w.t (sic) “denken” > (S) meeue (fem. inf. < *m3wj),
which is untenable. As rightly formulated by W. Vycichl (DELC 127), “Il est certain
qu’il s’agit toujours du même mot attesté de l’Ancien Empire jusqu’à l’époque grecque”.
nb3: Even worse is the analysis by W. M. Müller (1893, 35–36): (S) meeue < m3-3w
(sic) with 3w considered by him as a false replacement of the det. interpreted in the
Tanis “Sign Papyrus” as “ein #iegendes (oder hüpfendes) Herz” (eF-pei). False,

since the this det. (in use since XVIII.) derives ultimately from a reinterpretation
of the old phon. det. depicting a “granite vessel” (W7) accompanying diverse roots
)m32 (Sethe 1933, 18, fn. 61).
! In the light of the evidence listed below, the primary root sense might have been “to think out” (as rightly suggested in Wb, AEO, DELC l.c.), whence a secondary association with names could have resulted in a semantic shift to “to proclaim, give a name” (or sim.). This assumption seems con"rmed by the AA cognates (discussed in #1 below) too.
nb: C. T. Hodge (1997, 196–204) surveyed and (re)interpreted certain occurences
of the verb m32 as follows: (1) Louvre C15.7 stela (XI.): m32 “to ritually enumerate
(the sacred bark for its beauty)” (Hodge) contra “to acclaim” (FD), treated after Wb
& GHWb as a distinct root meaning “preisen” (q.v.); (2) CT I 141c, also VI 237f,

(of the King of Upper Egypt)” (Breasted 1906 I, 284), i.e., “who magically endows
s’one with a name” (Hodge), which hardly "ts a nomarch; (4) coronation scene of
Hatshepsut on the wall of her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahari (Urk. IV 260:2,

endowing the recipient with the name of power)” (Hodge somewhat differing from
Sethe 1928, 21, 32, 57; Wilson in Pritchard 1969, 4–6), (14) Pap. Bremner-Rhind
(BM 10188) 11:6 (around 300 BC): m3wj “commemoration (for)” (Hodge) contra

Schneider (1997, 198, #32) identi"ed (independently from one another) OEg. m32 [reg. < *mlk] with Sem. *mlk “to give advice, counsel” [ Hodge] = “einen richtigen Rat geben, entscheiden” [Kottsieper, UF 22, 1990, 150, n. 3], cf.

*“to advise, counsel”) [KB 591], NHbr. mlk “(be)raten” [GB] = “1. sich beraten, 2. mit sich zu Rate gehen, den Sinn ändern” [ Dalman 1922, 238] !! BAram. *m2lak, st.cstr. milk- “Rat” [GB 913], Aram. of TTM *milk3y, milk2y3 “deliberation, vacillation” [ Jastrow 1950, 790], Samar. Aram. mlk qal “4. to advise”, "etp2«1l “to consult”,

nb1: In Semitic etymology, Sem. *mlk “to give advice, counsel” is usually linked
to Sem. *mal(i)k- “king”. The traditional assumption that “to give advice” was
the basic meaning, whence “to rule” vs. “king” were derivative, goes back to Ibn
Jan3% (around 1000 AD, cf. Fürst & Ryssel 1876 I, 742), but in recent lexicographi
cal works the two roots are separated (e.g., König 1936, 226; Holladay 1971, 198
after Koehler & Baumgartner; Klein 1987, 350). Jastrow (1950, 790–1) derived
MHbr. mlk “1. to preside, of"ciate, 2. be ruler” from an original sense *“to lead in
council”, while melek “chief, king” from “leader in council”. Kopf (1976, 202–3,
§17), in turn, explained the kinship of Hbr. mlk “herrschen” & Ar. mlk “besitzen”
vs. Hbr. mlk nif «al “mit sich selbst zu Rate gehen” with a shift from the primary
sense “besitzen, in Besitz nehmen” > “sich einer Sache bemächtigen” > “(mein
Herz) wurde mir entrissen” (i.e. “ich war außer mir, geriet außer Rand und Band”).
Murtonen (1989, 260) assumed “in#uential advice” as a common basic meaning for
both Sem. *mlk “to advise” and *mal(i)k- “king”, while A. Mdcelaru (p.c., 22 April
2004), in turn, assumes a primary sense “to guide” for Sem. *mlk, whence all other
meanings can be derived. Thus, for instance, Ar. malik- may have originally signi
"ed “the one who guides”, i.e, Ar. mlk “to possess” was a secondary denom. verb.
These hypotheses do not satisfactorily clarify if there was indeed an etymological
connection between Sem. *mal(i)k- “king” and Sem. *mlk “to advice”. Was Sem.
*malk- “king” a pass. participle (pattern *pars-), i.e., “the one who was advised” (that
is: “suggested, appointed” for chief )? From this viewpoint, noteworthy is Emar ma
al-lu-ki “intronisation” [Zadok 1991, 117, #24]. This reasoning would be externally
corroborated by Eg. m32 “to proclaim”. For a different biconsonantal etymology of
Eg.-Sem. *mlk see Takács 1996, 14, §6.
nb2: Steinthal (1857, 408) saw in Hbr. mlk a biconsonantal root *lk. For an alterna
tive biconsonantal origin of Eg.-Sem. *mlk (eventually < AA *m-l), cf. Takács 1995,
159 and the entry for Eg. m33 (below).

nb3: Aside from Eg. m32, Sem. *mlk has no known AA parallels. The only extra
Sem. cognate may be perhaps NOm.: Kaffa mulèkk-o “intenzione” [Cecchi apud
Rn. 1888, 317], which, however, L. Reinisch (l.c., following A. Cecchi) derived from
a compound of two juxtaposed forms: mulÉ “stecken” + kavu “desiderare”.
! Other proposals on the etymology of Eg. m32 are evidently false: " 2. L. Reinisch (1873, 245) compared Eg. m32 with Cpt. mekmok (q.v.), Eg. m% (q.v.) and Teda ten “denken” (sic). False. " 3. W. M. Müller (1893, 35–36) assumed an Eg. etymon m3-3w (sic), in which he treated 3w as “nur eine Entstellung” of the det. explained as “#iegendes Herz” (since XVIII., derivining ultimately from the old det. W7 depicting “granite vessel”). He combined the “old stem” *m3 (!) with Eg. m3( j).t (sic) “Syenitstein” (correctly m32 “granite”) and m3wj “glänzen”. " 4. W. F. Albright (1927, 205) and C. T. Hodge (1976, 15, #145; 1997, 208) suggested comparing Eg. m32 = Sem. *brk ~ *krb “to bless”. Impossible both phonologically and semantically. " 5. L. Homburger (1929, 158; 1930, 284) and H. G. Mukarovsky (1959, 7, #8) compared Eg. m32 with Ful midy-3de “denken, betrachten, ré#échir” (Homburger adds Malinke miri, Ateso mita). Impossible even as areal parallels, since Eg. -2 < *-k.
nb: Following Taylor, Mukarovksy derives from Peul midy- < *mic-.
" 6. C. T. Hodge (1997, 212–213) postulated OEg. m3w2 “to formally name”, which he derived from Lislakh **l-k “to vocalize”. Hodge’s theory summarized below needs no comment.
nb1: Hodge suggested the common origin i.a. of the following roots according to
his so-called “consonnat ablaut” theory (cf. Hodge 1986): (1) LL **l-k “to vocal
ize”: Sem.: Akk. mal3ku “1. to give advice, 2. care for”, Ar. lwk: l3ka “to mumble”,
"al3ka “to transmit a message”, Geez malk2" “poetic eulogy” !!! Eg. j3k “to lament”
& j3kb “mourning” & m3tj.t “mourner” !!! SCu.: Irq. alki«-a (inf.) “to narrate” !!!

(2) LL **l-k “to think”: Eg. m3w2 “to think” !!! CCh. *lak- “to think” (OS). (3)
LL **l-k “to identify”: Sem. *malk- “ruler” (one designated) & Geez malkata “to

nb2: Hodge (1997, 207–213) treats these four Lislakh roots in the frameworks of
a greater word-family, which ultimately originates in LL proto-root **l-k “tongue”
(acc. to Hodge, the following sematic shifts are involved: 1. “tongue” " 2. “lick”
& “suck, suckle, milk” & “spit, spurt, pour out” – 3. “vocalize” " “special speech,
advise, think, knowledge” & “identify by naming” etc.). Hodge suggests an ultimate
etymological relationship of the most diverse Eg. roots: n2 “tongue”, snk “tongue”,
32 “to nurse”, rnn “to nurse”, jr2.t “milk”, z32 “to pour out”, b3q “olive oil”, nk “to
copulate”, nq.wt “moisture”, j3k “to lament”, j3kb “mourning”, m3tj.t “mourner”,
Frq “to swear an oath”, rnn “to rejoice”, n2%2% “to shout for joy”, m32 “to think”,
rn “name”, m3wt “title”, rk “time”. Unacceptable.

Br., appartenant à la famille des Asclépiadacées (ar. «ušar- ‘Asclepias gigantea’, BK II 261)” (Daumas
1957, 59–60) = “sehr wahrscheinlich ein Gesträuch mit dem Namen Calotropis procera mit seinen Doppelfrüchten” (Edel 1969, 11–13, d; cf. Edel 1981, 49) = “a plant of fragrant smell: sodom apple tree” (Borghouts 1971, 93, #160, cf. also 245) = “Art Baum” (Pusch 1974, 20 after Junker: Giza V 96) = “le calotrope (Calotropis procera)” (AL 77.1633) = “1. mandrake (?), 2. sodom apple tree (1x)” (DLE I 208) = “le calotrope, le Bed el-Ossar des Arabes, au lait particulièrement caustique employé comme dépilatoire (est incomestible)” (Aufrère 1986, 10) = “ein Baum” (Kahl 1992, 102, 110–1) = “Oschur, Apfel von Sodom (Calotropis procera): eine Art Strauch mit großen, steifen, rundlichen, blau bereiften Blättern und viel Milchsaft” (GHWb 322; ÄWb I 506).
nb1: The OK form was m32.t (in a Giza offering list and PT 1440e, cf. Wb II 34,
23; ÄWb I 506). In the view of some authors (following Edel 1969), the same word
appears in CT II 401a as m32r.t (5 times: B1Bo, B2Bo, B4Bo, Y1C, T3C) vs. m32.t
(B6C, BH2C, G1T). Thus, E. Edel, D. Meeks, R. Hannig, J. Kahl and others assume
the original form as m32r.t (Edel: from *m32rj.t), which later was reduced to m32.t
due to the erosion of -r. Or assimilated to *-j-: *m'32.'rj't > *m'32.'jj't (Edel)? But
since both cases of OK m32.t are attested without -r, while the occasional CT var.
m32r.t may be due to a later contamination with m32r.t “female mourner” (below),
the hypothetic original form *m32r.t remains dubious.
nb2: The interpretation of the CT instances is not completely evident. In the view
of Edel (1969, 11–13, n. d) and Borghouts (1971, 93, n. 160) followed by Aufrère
(1986, 10, n. 160), it was the name of a tree-goddess in PT 1440e, CT II 401a
and VII 228q. Among the older occurences, in the view of Borghouts (l.c.), m32.t
meant the very plant only once (OK, Junker: Giza V, "g. 26). R. O. Faulkner saw
in all vars. of CT II 401a (AECT II 140–1, spell 162, n. 12) the mythological
"gure M3tr2.t, the plant det. of B6C and tree det. of Y1C being evidently due to a
120 m3&.t



“misreading” as the m32.t plant. The same confusion occurs in the case of CT VII
228q, where Faulkner (AECT III 112, spell 1012, n. 4) restores m32r.t from m32.t
(with plant det.!). Note that R. van der Molen (DCT 158–9) reads the tree-goddess
basically as m32.t. In CT IV 121b, it signi"es clearly the plant (AECT II 242, 244,
n. 38 of spell 317; DCT 158). CT IV 122h is out of question, m32r.wt evidently
standing here for “female mourners” (AECT II 242, 244, n. 45 of spell 317; DCT
159). According to D. Meeks (AL 78.1648), in turn, CT II 401a (!) m32.t ~ m32r.t
& CT IV 121b m32.t signi"ed the plant, while at the same time, he (AL 78.1650)
translated CT II 401a (!) m32r.t and CT IV 122h m32.t as “pleureuse”. Note that
among the "ve vars. of CT II 401a m32r.t only one (Y1C) has a tree det., the others
do not differ from the wtg. of m32r.t “female mourner”.
nb3: As rightly pointed out by Daumas (1957, 59–66), Borghouts (1971, 93), Kákosy
(1971, 164, n. v), Meeks (AL 77.1633), Aufrère (1986, 10) and others, Eg. m32.t
“mandrake” has been later confused with Eg. m3t.t “celery” (not attested before
Med., q.v.), which it has nothing to do with as mistakenly supposed even most recently
(e.g. by W. Vycichl in DELC 124 and C. T. Hodge 1997, 209). Sometimes, due to
the merger of 2 vs. t after the OK, only the context can decide (cf. Barns 1956, 19;
Aufrère 1986, 10). Against the false interpretation of Med. m3t.t as “mandrake”
(Dawson 1933, 133–5) see Loret (1894, 4–11), Lefébvre (1955, 208), and WÄDN
216–8. Daumas (l.c.) declined the sense “mandrake” also for OK-CT m32.t. Daw
son (1933, 137) erroneously projected the plant-name m32.t (as “a generic term for
magical plants of various kinds”) into m3t.t n.t sw.t (Pap. Budapest 51.1961, rt. 2:4),
which may be an error for Med. m3.t n.t sw.t (cf. Wb II 6, 12; Kákosy l.c.).
! Etymology debated. " 1. E. Edel (1969, 11–13, d; also 1981, 49) proposed to identify OKCT m32.t < m32r.t as the name of plant and tree-goddess (Edel: act. “der Baum Calotropis procera am Himmelstor, der schützend den Eingang zum Himmel bewacht”, lit. “die Preisende”) with OK-CT (since Dyn. IV) m32r.t (pl. m32r.wt) “Frauenbezeichnung” (Edel: actually “Baumgöttin personi"ziert”, lit. “die Preisenden”), which he eventually explained from Eg. m32 (orig. *m32r?) “preisen”. Thus, in his view, the m32r.t-tree was “der Baum, der die Sonne bei ihrem . . . Aufgang ‘preise’ ”, while the OK-CT m32r.t-women (NK m3trj.t) were ultimately “im Ritualspiel die Darstellerinnen des heiligen m3G(r)t-Baumes, der als Wächterin des Himmelstores des Morgens die aufgehende Sonne ‘preisend’ begrüßt ”. That is, Edel suggested the following derivational chain: “to praise” " “tree praising the sun” " “Calotropis”. This theory breaks down on a few points.
nb1: Following Dawson (1933, 133) and Sethe (ÜKAPT V 373–4), Edel assumed
a continuity between PT 1440d m32.t (giving its arms to the dead and named “die
Türhüterin des Himmels”, jrj.t-«3 n.t p.t) and CT II 401a m32r.t (named “Tochter
des Morgensterns”, z3.t n2r dw3.j), whose jaws («r.tj “die beiden Kinnladen”) they
considered as a metaphor of both door-leaves (“die beiden Tür#ügel”) of the heav
enly gate. This led Edel to the assumption that “nichts scheint im Wege zu stehen, in den
m3Gr.t-Frauen des Alten Reiches die Darstellerinnen jenes Himmelsbaumes zu sehen, der dem Toten
hilfreich seine Hände entgegenstreckt, um ihm den Eintritt in den Himmel zu gewähren”. He
took it granted that the “auffallende imposante Laubfülle” of Calotropis procera, which
grows “in Gestalt riesiger Stauden und nimmt selbst Bauform an” (Keimer 1967, 26–27),
was conceived in ancient Egypt “als ein die ‘Türe’ des Himmels ausfüllendes Hindernis,
das . . . dem Toten den Durchgang nicht verwehrt, sondern freundlich ‘seine Arme (Zweige)’
m3&.t 121



hinstreckt ”. Besides, “wegen ihrer hohen Giftigkeit . . . ist Calotropis procera als Türwächter aufs
beste geeignet ” (Edel). Indeed, this function of the plant as protection of houses is
attested in modern Egypt (cf. Keimer 1967, 27; Aufrère 1986, 10; cf. also Borghouts
1971, 112–3, n. 235). Accoding to R. O. Faulkner (AECT I 140–1, spell 162, n. 12),
however, the name of the goddess m32r.t was only misread as the m32.t-plant, i.e.,
these are two distinct words.
nb2: This far-fetching theory can hardly be founded on MEg. m32 “preisen”
(hapax), which, according to the Belegstellen to Wb II 34, 22, is attested only on
one stela (XI., Louvre C 15, 7), and was rendered “to acclaim” in FD 104, which
expresses more properly the sense of the underlying verb m32 “to proclaim” (CT,
FD 104; DCT 158). Moreover, this must go back to m32 “erdenken, ersinnen (bes.
einen Namen)” (OK, Wb, below), whose root was, besides, certainly not )m32r,
but rather )m3w2 (details below s.v. m32). Thus, the derivation of OK-CT m32r.wt
“female mourners” from m32 “to praise” is certainly excluded both on semantical
and phonological grounds. The name of the tree-goddess, in turn, with an extra
-r in CT II 401a may be due to a contamination with m32r.t “female mourner”
(discussed above).
" 2. GT: provided CT II 401a indeed re#ects the correct reading (m32r.t) of the plant, and with respect to the milk-like juice issuing from Calotropis procera, it would be tempting to risk interpreting it as the *“weeping tree” and identifying it with Eg. m32r “to weep for” (DCT 159). The milky juice of the tree is presumably has no link to the association of the plant-name with the testicles (below). " 3. W. R. Dawson (1933, 135, §5) considered it to be etymologically akin to Eg. m3w.tj “testicles” (above), which in principle might derive from *m32 via *m3wt. This assumption, based on the rendering “mandrake”, however, implies a derivation of LEg. m3wt( j) “testicles” from OEg. m32.t, not vice versa, since the former has no OEg. etymon.
nb1: There might have been an association between the “fruit” of the m32.t-plant
(due to its shape) and the testicles in Egypt, cf. Mag. Pap. Leiden I 348, 5:8–6:1
(in an enumeration of parts of the body ascribed to gods): jns.wj=fj m pr.t m3t.t
“seine Testikeln sind die Früchte der m3t.t-P#anze” (Edel l.c. after Dawson 1933,
133). Similarly, in a text from a Dendera socle (BIFAO 56/1, 1957, 44: col. 11
& 46, n. 3), m32.t is compared to the testicles (Daumas l.c.). Dawson (1933, 134)
explained the dets. of m32.t in PT 1440e (P727: circle, M751: two grains) as due to
an association with the testicles and quoted a Syriac med. manuscript with a long
passage devoted to the mandrake: “. . . and after the "ower of this root . . . had died away,
there remain on the top thereof two little balls which are like the testicles of a man”.
nb2: Ar. marik- “jeune homme supçonné de se livrer à la prostitution” [BK II
1095] can hardly be a "tting external parallel to a hypothetic OEg. *m32 (or sim.)
“testicle”.
" 4. GT: the most convincing AA parallels suggest PAA *m-l-k ~ *ml-g “tree with sticky fruit or yielding gum resin” [GT ], which meets certain features of Eg. m32.t.

nb: Plausible provided we accept the sense “acclaim”. Questionable on semantical
grounds if we stick to the sense “to praise”.
" 2. E. Edel (1969, 14) explained m32 from an older *m32r > *m32j, which he etymologically related eventually with CT m32r “beweinen” (q.v.). Semantically untenable.
nb: D. Meeks (AL 79.1149) rightly distingished our Dyn. XI hapax from LEg. m32
“se lamenter” (KRI II 883:3).
" 3. GT: if we maintain the sense “to praise” and treat it as a distinct lexeme (but not necessarily as a different root), it could be compared with the secondary denominative sense of ES *"amlak (formally pl.

"amlaka “to worship God, a deity, idols”, "aml2ko(t) “cult, godli

nb: Since ES *mlk ultimately derives from Sem. *malk- “king” (cf. Leslau l.c.), we
may assume an eventual relationship with Sem. *mlk “to advise”, and thus possibly
also with Eg. m32 “to proclaim”. If this is the case, the following semantic develop
ment in Sem. may be postulated: “to give an advise” " “one who was advised (i.e.:
appointed) " (deverbal noun) “king” " denom. Ar. mlk “to rule, possess” vs. ES
pl. *"amlak “God” " denom. “to worship”. The semantic shift in our Dyn. XI
hapax might be thus compared to that of ES *mlk.

P. Munro (1993 I, 91f.) rendered the OK title as “die zum m32j.t-Gewand Gehörige”,
which is hardly correct (cf. below). It is true that the m32r.t-women are some way
connected with garment or strip of cloth both in OK and NK instances, but how
it relates to the duties of m32r.wt remains open (cf. Edel l.c., esp. fn. 8).

Instead, he preferred a derivation from m32 “erdenken, ersinnen, den Namen verkünden”, although Hornung himself referred to m3trj.t (XVIII.) published by R. Caminos (1956, 28). Rightly rejected by Edel (l.c.). " 3. E. Edel (1969, 11–14; also 1981, 49) identi"ed the mythological tree-goddess m32.t (PT 1440e: jrj.t-«3 n.tp.t “Türhüterin des Him
mels”), m32r.t (CT II 401a: z3.t n2r dw3.j “Tochter der Morgensterns”), m3t.t < *m32r.t (CT VII 228: daughter of Re, AECT III 112, n. 4), which he regarded a personi"cation of m32.t “Calotropis procera” (Daumas 1957, 60) with a literal meaning “die Preisende” (“Baumgöttin personi!ziert, durch Frauen dargestellt, die bei den Bestattungszeremonien eine Rolle spielen”). Eventually, Edel sought the etymon of OK m32r.t in the Eg. hapax m32 “preisen” (XI., Wb, q.v.), since as he was arguing – “eine ‘Preisende’ ” "ts “gut zu der Weinenden’, ‘Trauernden’ und ‘Klagenden’ . . .”. Dubious for several reasons.
nb1: For Edel (l.c.) “nichts scheint im Wege zu sein, in den m3!r.t-Frauen des Alten Reiches
die Darstellerinnen jenes Himmelsbaumes zu sehen, der dem Toten hilfreich seine Hände entge
genstreckt, um ihm den Eintritt in den Himmel zu gewähren”. Moreover, he extended the
features of PT-CT m32r.t to an unattested conception “wonach der Baum die Sonne bei
ihrem . . . Aufgang ‘preise’ . . . ‘preisend’ begrüßt . . .”.
nb2: There is no proof for that m32 “preisen” (XI.) represents a root *m32r > *m32j
as Edel surmised, since not even the trace of *-j was preserved (as e.g. in Amduat
m3tj.t). Accoding to R. O. Faulkner (AECT I 140–1, spell 162, n. 12), the name of the

nb: This etymology ignores the -r- of OK m32r.t. Besides, a nisbe of m3t.t would
be *m3t.t.j. Moreover, it has not been satisfactorily clari"ed how the cloth relates
to the duty of the m32r.wt.

môry-3 ~ môrê-3 ~ m.rey-3 [ Rn.: *-rd-] “Feile” and even to Amh. moräd “"le”.
Phonologically unconvincing.
nb2: The Cushitic forms like LECu.: Orm. m.rod-ã “"le, rasp” [ Rn. 1888 l.c.], Som.
mor†d (m) “Instrument womit man beim Gerben die Haare vom Fell wegkratzt” vs.
(vb. tr.) “ein Fell enthaaren” [ Rn. 1902, 300] ! HECu.: Sdm. morod-à “whetstone,

"le” [ Hds.], Brj. morad- “to "le” [Sasse 1982, 147] (HECu.: Hds. 1989, 121) are
hardly to be compared with Eg. m3d, since these represent a late borrowing from
ES, cf. Amh. moräd “"le”, denom. morrädä “to "re”, which, in turn, ultimately
come from a nomen instr. *mä-wräd < *mä-bräd < Sem. *brd, cf. Amh. bärrädä

mabrad “"le, rasp”, Ar. mibrad- “"le, razor” etc. (Sem.: Lsl. 1987, 103). L. Reinisch
(1888, 315) and W. Leslau (1959, 40) saw in Kaffa mõder-. and Mocha modar-o
too loans with a met. from Amh. moräd “"le”. Questionable. Note that L. Reinisch
(l.c.) erroneously af"liated the Somali form with Sem. *mr9 “enthaaren”.
nb3: Margi mùrd_È seems unrelated to WCh.: Hausa múrzà “1. to roll some thread,
2. rub sg. between one’s palms, 3. massage (husband’s) limbs to remove tiredness

Margi: IS 1965, 358; 1976, #310), since WCh. *z seems to have a distinct re#ex
in BM (Stl. 1996, 114, table 22).
" 4. GT: or m3d < mrd, perhaps an irregular (Eg. -d vs. Sem. *-t) re#ex of OSA: Sab. mrt “clay(ey)” [ Ricks] = “clay(ey soil)” (listed with squared stones, muddy soil, lead) [Biella 1984, 285] = “lime

stone (?)” [SD 87; Lsl.] = “calcaire” [Arbach], Qtb. mrt “Lehm” [ Rdk. 1924, 47 rejected by Sima] = “limestone, gypsum” [ Ricks 1982 MS, 145] = “calcaire” [Arbach] = “Ziegel, Keramik” [Sima], Madhabi mrt-n “sorte de perre taillé” [Arbach 1993, 71], Min. mrt “Keramik” [Sima] !! Geez mar1t “Erde, Lehm, Ton” [Sima after Dillmann] = “dirt, dust” [ Ricks] = “clay(ed soil)” [Biella] = maret “earth, dust of the ground, dirt, soil, clay, plaster, dung” [Lsl. 1987, 361] = “vielleicht ein dem Ziegel ähnliches Baumaterial?” [Sima], Tigre & Tna. & Amh. märet “earth, ground” [Lsl.]?
nb: The Sem. etymology of the OSA-ES isogloss is debated. The Sem. cognates (Ar.
mal39 “gypsum”, Modern Yemeni Ar. mr9 “to plaster”) suggested by M. A. Ghul
(1959, 4) are doubtful for the consonantal correspondences. Sima (2000, 299–301)
assumes for the OSA forms a root )mrr with the basic sense “unglasierte, gebrannte
Keramik, d.h. Terrakotta” etymologically based on Yemeni Ar. murr- “eine Erde, die
für Landwirtschaft und als Rohmaterial für Keramik sehr geeignet ist” [Sima, not in
Piamenta 1990–91, 462; Behnstedt 1993, 194], but he failed in explaining the con
nection with the ES forms which derive from )mrt (“ist nicht eindeutig zu klären”).

Tsamay mid “lower grindstone” [Sava 2005 MS, 259] seems to be accidental, since there is no re#ex (*-r/l/"-) for Eg. -3-.
nb1: L. Reinisch (l.c.) assumes in Saho-Afar a nomen instr. from a root akin to Ar.
wa2ada, wa9ada, cf. mi-y9ad-at- “Walze”. Phonologically problematic.

Etymology uncertain due to the late attestation. Only guesses are possible. Nevertheless, the solution nr. 2 seems quite promising.

" 1. GT: the det. (W8: “granite bowl”) suggests prima vista (perhaps misleadingly) a connection with the root m32. Perhaps a nisbe of *m3d < MK m3t < OK m32, lit. “carriers of granite dishes?”, akin to Eg. m32 “Granitschale” (IÄF, discussed above)? " 2. GT: in spite of the (purely phon.?) det. W8, perhaps a substantivized part. (on the pattern of sdm.jw, wnnj.w) of an old *m33 (var. of the attested m3w3, above?) “to carry (on shoulder?)”?
m3dj.w 129



! The chances of external etymologies are here rather little: " 3. GT: assuming mdj.w (GW), a comparison with LECu.: Som. mid5dín “servant, assistant” [Abr. 1964, 179] !!! NOm.: Omt. mad“lavorare, servire, ministrare, aintare” [ Mrn. 1938, 143] !!!

prêter assistance à qqn., l’aider avec qqch.”, IV “2. aider, assister qqn., lui donner
des secours (en troupes, en vivres, etc.); envoyer des troupes auxilières à qqn.”, X
“1. demander des secours, de l’assistance chez qqn. contre qqn.” [BK II 1075–6]
!!! LECu.: Som. m3d “protection”, m3d-iy- “to protect, safeguard” [LS] !!! NOm.
*m3d- “to help” [LS 1997, 456] !!! WCh.: perhaps Tng. madî “to protect, help,
save” [ Jng. 1991, 118]. O. V. Stolbova (1996, 113) equated Tng. madî (semantically
unconvincingly) with CCh.: Mafa me'- “donner tout ce que est dû à qqn.”.
" 4. GT: or act. substantivized part. of an unattested Eg. *m3d “to wait” < *mld (lit. - Eng. “waiter”, German “Aufwärter”?), eventually cognate with WCh.: Tala milidu “to wait for” [Csp. 1994, 37]?
m3dd “somnoler” (LP, Vernus 1978, 145, n. 1; AL 78.1651).
nb: Its det. (A7: “man sinking to ground from fatigue”, EG 1927, 436) suggests
tiredness.
! Etymology uncertain due to the late attestation. No evident cognates. " 1. GT: any connection to LEg. m3t “von der auf der Bahre liegenden Osiris"gur” (GR, Wb II 33, 10) = “le gisant (?)” (AL 79.1145)?
nb: LEg. m3t (q.v.) comes from an unattested *m32 “who is lying on the bier (or
sim.)”, derived (by participial m-) from OEg. 32.t “1. Bett, 2. auch von der Bahre
des Osiris” (OK, Wb I 23, 11).
" 2. GT: or GW for mdd, eventually cognate with LECu.: Orm.-Borana mudda (var. of muga!) “to feel sleepy” [Strm. 1987, 370; 1995, 211] !!! WCh.: Zeem (taarù) ma*aì, Tule (dar) m2*Ü “to sleep” (NBch.: Smz. 1978, 37, #71)?
nb: Very uncertain comparison. The main form in Orm. was apparently muga “to
sleep a little, slumber” [Gragg 1982, 293], while the SBch. forms seem isolated
within Chadic, unless they are somehow connected to SBch. *mUr- (or sim.) “to
sleep” as H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 II, 298) are suggesting, which
excludes any connection to LEg. m(3)dd.

130 m3dd – m3!.w



nb1: Context obscure. Occurs in the expression m33.w jpn n.w zm.t “these m33.w
of the desert” (AEPT), cf. OEg. zmj.t ~ zm.t “Wüste” (OK, Wb III 444–5). R. O.
Faulkner (AEPT 89, utt. 300, n. 7) found “dif"cult to accept” K. Sethe’s (ÜKAPT
l.c.) rendering, though he had “no alternative to offer”. Indeed hard to imagine
how this meaning can "t context, cp. perhaps NK m3w3 “yoke (?)” in its "gurative
sense “foundation” in Pap. Wilbour (Gardiner 1948, 18) = “endowment” (Breasted
received by Grd. with reservation) = “Feldbezeichnung (vgl. lat. iugum ‘Querholz’ vs.
iugerum ‘die von einem unter dem Joch stehenden Gespann beim P#ügen erreichte
Leistung’)” (Hassan 1979, 121–4).
nb2: Meeks (l.c.) reads m33.w not as pl. (contra Wb; ÜKAPT; GHWb; ÄWb), but
as sg. m3w3 (q.v.) changing the sequence of 3 + w to w + 3. The three dets. speak,
however, in favour of a pl. *m33.w.
! From the same root (?): m3d.w “(Substantiv)” (hapax, Pap. Prisse 13:2; Wb II 35, 4) = “impartialité (renvoie probablement à la distribution et au nombre égal des pions avant l’ouverture du jeu)” (Baba 1956, 153–4, n. 417) = “les balanciers, les équilibres” (Vernus 1997, 439f.) = “Balancierstange, Tragejoch” ( Junge 2003, 247, n. 417).
nb1: Its obscure det. (left in hieratic in Wb) was identi"ed by P. Vernus (l.c.) with
a ligature of D41 (forearm with palm of hand downwards) + pl. strokes, while
Z. Baba suggested “peut-être le damier”.
nb2: The context suggests a "gurative sense “impartialité” (Baba) derivable from
“balanciers” (Vernus).
nb3: Already P. Vernus (l.c.), followed by F. Junge (l.c.), linked Pap. Prisse m3d.w
to PT 445d m33.w.
! If the rendering “Balancierstange” (or sim.) is correct, we may assume evidently an old *m33 as var. to the better attested m3w3. The AA cognates, besides, suggest a primary form *m33 < *mrg, which is a perfect match of ECh.: Kera ámàrgá “Rückentrage für Säuglinge” [Ebert 1976, 26], cf. also NOm. *mUrg- “shoulder” [GT ] (further details s.v. Eg. m3w3).
nb: Note that, in spite of the speculation on the context of PT m33.w and the
metaphoric sense of Eg. m3w3 in Pap. Wilbour (above), there can hardly be any
kinship with ECh.: WDng. mórgó “champ” [ Fédry 1971, 137] = mòrgó “"elds
(farm)” [ JI 1994 II, 135], which V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED #1741) erroneously
equated with Ar. marC- “pré, prairie” [BK II 1087] = “meadow” [Kogan]. The
latter is an Iranian loanword, cf. Av. mar233 “Wiese” [Bartholomae 1901, 1147]
as pointed out by L. Kogan (2002, 195, #1741).
mj “komme!” (OK, Wb II 35, 9–14) = “come!” (FD 104, cf. EG §336).
nb: Note the OK pl. form mjw (AL 77.1636).
! Hence: Cpt.: (SBAF) amou (m), (SBF) amhA(f ), pl. (S) amheitN “komme!” (KHW 5).
nb: Vocalization by Fecht (1960, 131, §252): *jamãj'j (m) vs. *jamÉj'j (f ). Edel’s
(AÄG §296) *j'm5j'" was declined by C. Peust (1992, 120), who, following W. Vycichl
(1936, 172), identi"ed in the Cpt. endings -ouA< *-ã(m) vs. -h < *-)(f ) the AA gender

nb3: Chadic “to return” is hardly related to NOm. *ma==- “to return” [GT ], cf.

Kaffa ham “andare” [Crl.], Shn. am- “to go” [Lmb.] (ECu.-NOm.: Crl. 1938 II,
188; Shn.-Som.: Lmb. 1994, 115), although these parallels suggest a Cu.-Om. root
*"am- [GT ]. Lit. for Eg.-Cu.: Rn. 1886, 877 (Afar-Eg.); Zhl. 1932–1933, 165, fn. 1
(Saho-Eg.); Chn. 1947, #484 (Som.-Eg.); Rsl. 1987, 384 (Eg.-LECu.); Hodge 1990,
172 (Eg.-PCu.); Ehret 1995, 301, #570 (Eg.-PCu.); Blz. 1997, 177 (Bed.-HECu.);
Apl. 2005 MS, 27 & 2006, 47 (Eg.-Cu.). But H.-J. Sasse (1982, 21) analyzed the
LECu. root as *am- + vowel ending, which would be misleading to compare with
the Coptic re#exes of OEg. mj (with a prothetic j- of the imperative).
NB5: It is dif"cult to "nd an agreement in Cushitic studies concerning the etymo
logical analysis of the Cu.-Om. verbs for “to come” described in this entry, cf. e.g.:
(1) L. Reinisch (1886, 877), M. Cohen (1947, #484): Bed. ma"a ~ LECu. *mV"- ~
LECu.: Afar am, Somali imo ~ Eg. mj. Reinisch (1890, 277) treated Saho amõ
“komm!” as impv. of the maw “kommen” under the same root. (2) E. Zyhlarz
(1932–33, 165–166, fn. 1): Saho impv. analyzed as a-m. < mat- “to come”.
(3) A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 246), followed by A. Zaborski (1989, 579): ECu. impv.
*am-/*im- “come!” ~ LECu. *mV"- “to come”, derived (Dlg.) from ECu. *mVt- “to
come”. (4) H.-J. Sasse (1982, 21) and G. Hudson (1989, 404): HECu. impv. “come!”
< *am- ~ Saho impv. am-o (Sasse). (5) M. Lamberti (1986, 684): Arb. impv. sg. may
~ Som. impv. imaw < “OCu.” *im3t-/*imit-. Later Lamberti (1994, 115) proposed
Sns. am- ~ Som. im-3d- < “OCu.” *im-. (6) Ch. Ehret (1995, 301, #570): Cu.
*"im(t)- (with a “durative” suf"x *t) ~ Eg. mj ~ Ch. *mb- “to come” [ Jng.] < AA
*-im- “to come”. Similarly, D. Appleyard (2005 MS, 27; 2006, 47): stem *mV"- >
HECu. *am-, Bed. m"a, Agaw *"2nt-(ät)-, ECu. *mVt- ~ Eg. mj.
nb6: L. Reinisch (1887, 253) combined má"a “veni!” with a number of impossible
parallels, e.g. Bilin la%w, lan%/0 “komm!” and its Agaw cognates, Eg. n« (q.v.) >
nhou “venire”.
NB7: P. Newman (1977, 30) derives also CCh.: Zime mbu “to come” from PCh.
*ma “to return”. Although the change mb- < *m- seems plausible in the Masa
group, the vowel -u and the slightly different meaning suggest that Zime mbu and
Ch. *ma are not connected. Cf. also Lame mbù “1. venir, 2. apporter” [Scn. 1982,
308], Zime-Dari mbù “venir” [Cooper 1984, 18]
NB8: J. Lukas (1975, 224) gives ECh.: Mkl. mâa"édí “come!” (which looks as if
the root were *mâa"-), but recently H. Jungraithmayr (1990, 97) has recorded
only Mkl. k-édí/k-áàdí “viens!” (cf. Mkl. ’éttó “venir, arriver, s’approcher, amener,
apporter”).
NB9: Of course, Bed. *ma"- “kommen” has nothing to do with Eg. n« as suggested
by L. Reinisch (1895, 161). This Eg. etymology was rightly abandoned (as “fern
liegendes”) already by C. Brockelmann (1932, 805).
NB10: L. Homburger (1930, 283) equates Eg. mj with Ful (Peul) ma “auxiliaire
futur impératif ” (sic). No comment.



nb11: In the frames of his “consonant ablaut” theory, C. T. Hodge (1990, 172)
derived Eg. mj & Cu. *"im(t)- “to come” [Ehret 1987, 107] from Lislakh **"2-NbCV
and **Nb-C, resp. (ultimately from LL **b-C) with the following alleged cognates:
Sem. *b" (sic) “to enter” [ WUS #45] !!! LEg. nbnb “to come” (GR, Wb II 245) !!!
Cu. *bA%- [ Hodge: suf"x *-%-] “to go in” [ Dlg. 1973, 318] !!! PCh. *mb- “to go,
come” [ JS 1981, 118] & Ch. (act. only NBch.) *buw- “to come” [Skn. 1977, 16]
!! CCh.: Ga’anda Ha- “to come” [Nwm. > Hodge]. These forms represent at least
three (or four) distinct roots. Cf. Eg. b34 & bj3 & nbnb.
mj.t “Art Schiff (bei der Fahrt des Toten)” (MK, Wb I 41, 12) = mj.t ~ mj.tj “kind of boat” (MK, Jones 1988, 137, #32) = “ein in seiner auf eine elliptische Bogenform reduzierten Seitenansicht archaisch wirkender, papyrusförmiger Bootstyp, aus dem die gesamte Flottille der Bestattungsfahrt besteht” (VI–XII., Dürring 1995, 150) = mj.t( j) “Art Schiff (bei der Fahrt des Toten)” (VI. 3x, ÄWb I 515).
nb: R. Hannig (ÄWb l.c.) assumes an older mr.t (fully plausible, since the word is
written with the hrgl. W19).
! J. Settgast (1963, 75, fn. 1) connected it to MK mr.t “Art, Schiff ” (Wb, q.v.). Approved by Dürring (l.c.), who extended this comparison (in a semantically rather unconvincing manner) to m3.t “proue (d’un navire)” (AL 77.1572; Meeks 1994, 258, discussed above), since “die Gleichsetzung des mj.t mit m3.t mit der . . .

nb1: Already K. Piehl (1893, 492) surmized, purely on Eg. grounds, that Eg. mjw

136 mj.t



nb1: LEg. mt (with a different orthography and masc. article p3!) “Weg” quoted by
Fischer-Elfert (1986, 76, 89: three exx.) is probably not the same word, but may
directly continue old m2n (q.v.).
nb2: For LP mj.t see also Jansen-Winkeln (1996, 95, §148).
! Origin debated: " 1. Most authors (e.g., CED 92; KHW 89; AL 77.1646 & 1938; DELC 109) agree on the continuity of OEg. m2n “way” (OK, Wb II 176), act. *måj'2'n > *måj2'n (Fecht 1960, 180, §373) " NK mj.t " Dem. mjt (masc.) “Weg” (DG 153:11) " Cpt.: (S) moeit, (A) maeitAetc. “1. Weg, 2. Ort, Stätte” (KHW 89) = “road, path” (CD 188a).
nb: The OEg. > Cpt. derivation is certainly correct, but the etymology for the
fem. NEg. mj.t remains doubtful. The shift of OEg. -n > NEg. -j or -Ø is indeed
explainable (Lacau 1970, 29–41; cf. also NBÄ 592f., n. 534; Vcl. 1990, 220f.; Peust
1999, 157, §3.14.5). Thus we might assume OK m2n > NK *mtj (cf. masc. mt apud
Fischer-Elfert l.c.) > Dem. mjt (m) with metathesis > Cpt. Burkard (1977, 21) explains
the unexpected replacement of old m2n of the original text of Merikare by mj.t.t
“similarity” (!) in the P var. as Lesefehler for NK mj.t which was purely a younger
synonym of old m2n (contra Scharff assuming a Hörfehler, i.e., an identical pronuncia
tion of *mjt < old m2n vs. mj.t.t already in the NK). Moreover, NK mj.t had a fem.
article, the root being apprently conceived as *mj. Thus, in spite of their similarity,
old m2n and NK mj.t may represent two distinct etymons that were probably only
confused as correctly surmised by Smith (1978, 360). It was presumably Dem. (with
the vacillation in gender) when the two had merged. Similarly, the identi"cation of
the two has been carefully avoided already in Wb (l.c. vs. II 176).
" 2. H. Smith (1978, 360) admitted that the derivation of (S) moeit from old m2n may be valid, but “it seems conceivable that” LEg. mj.t was a distinct word derived by m- preformative from Eg. )w3 (sic, cf. w3.t “road, way”) and not “directly” connected with the late form of old m2n.
nb: Dubious because of the lack of an old etymon *m3.t proving the alleged shift
-3- > -j-.
" 3. GT: perhaps from *)mj, cognate with ES: Gafat mäya “road” [Lsl. 1945, 165] = mäyä [Lsl. 1956, 219], Grg. *meya “road, way” [GT ]: Enm. meya, End. meyä, Gyeto mäya (Grg.: Lsl. 1979 III, 441) !!! WCh.: Bokkos & Butura ma" “bridge” [ Magwa etc. 1985, 10]?
nb1: The ES parallels are isolated in Sem. W. Leslau (1945, 1956 l.c.) connected the
Gafat word to MSA: Sqt. mi«eh “side” ! ES: Harari mihe ~ mihiye “side” vs. mi%i
“vicinity, near, beside”, Grg.: Chaha ema, mea, meyä etc. “rib, side of the body”.
Later, however, Leslau (1979) avoided this semantically unconvincing equation.
nb2: The semantic shift “road” > “bridge” is banal, cf. e.g. Lat. p.ns < IE *pœt
“path” (LEW 336).
nb3: The underlying verbal root may have eventually been AA *m-() “to go, come”
[GT ] (with an uncertain weak second root consonant), cf. esp. WCh.: Glm. máyà
“journey”, yí máyá “to travel” [Alio 1988 MS]. The same semantic shift may be
observed also in SCu.: WRift *"am-o “path, way” [GT ]: Alg. amo, pl. amamu, Brg.
amo, pl. ama"i (WRift: Wtl. 1958, 24, #79), which seems to be related to Cu.-Om.
root *"am- “to come, go” [GT ]. For further details see Eg. mj “komm!” (q.v.).

utt. 674, n. 13) = “Messer” (PT 1999c & GR, Wb II 31, 13) = “ein altes Wort für
Messer” (Helck, LÄ IV 111–2) = “ein Messer” (PT 1999c, GHWb 321; ÄWb I
505). P. Wilson’s untenable rendering of PT 1999c m3z.w tpj.w rmn.wj 3%wtj as
“knives in (sic) Thoth’s hands (sic)” (PL l.c.), contra Faulkner’s (AEPT l.c.) “the spines
which are on the arms of Thoth”, continues presumably an ancient contamina
tion, which, in fact, the use of m3z “knife” (with knife det., m3 hrgl., no -j-) in PT
1999c (and also the T1C var. of CT I 289c) instead of mj3z “spine” (spines det.,
usually spelled alphabetically or with initial mj/mr) is due to. This assumption is
corroborated by further instances of the same context (PT 1560, CT I 289 & VI
103h), where clearly mj3z is used in association with the “spines” of Thoth. Thus,
following Wb (II 42, 11 vs. 31, 13), R. Hannig rightly lists PT 1999 m3z “Messer”
vs. PT 1560 mj3z “Stachel usw.” in two separate entries as two distinct lexemes
mj3z.w 141



(ÄWb I 505 vs. 512, resp.). In CT 289c, the “grains of corn” (M33) det. of mj3s.w
(T2C) vs. mj3z (T9C) is probably a transformation of the old “spines” det. (PT
1560c), which, along with the “knife” det. of T1C var. of CT I 289c as well as in
CT VI 103h, also testi"es to that the original sense of mj3z was no longer fully
understood. Note that K. Sethe (ÜKAPT VI 129) transliterated PT 1560c mj3z
falsely as m3z. Cf. also Leclant 1975, 144.
nb2: Thoth in this context could have hardly been envisaged as a baboon (as Faulkner
AECT II 147 thinks), but rather as an ibis (cf. PT 1560c: šw.wt tpj.wt rmn.wj=fj
m mj3z.w “the plumes on his shoulders being like spines”, AEPT), and the shaft
of its feathers (AEPT) or its pinions (DCT) are meant, although it may have been
equivocal originally which part of the bird was exactly meant. Thus, in both PT
1999b–c (“your nails which are on your "ngers, the spines which are on the arms
of Thoth”) and CT VI 103h (mjz.w «n.t tpj.t 3b«.w=k mj mjz.w tpj.w 3b«.w 3%wtj
“the spines of the nails which are on your "ngers”), presumably the claws (AECT)
or talons (DCT), resp., on the bird’s toes are referred to.

Ch. Ehret (1987, 110, #466) set up PCu. *"ar- “forehead” based on Agaw *"ar- and

There was no uniform orthography of the root especially until the MK (as is shown by the table of Edel 1986, 32–33; Hodge 1992, 211–2 listing the various spellings of the word, for a survey cf. also Smith 1933, 153; Drenkhahn 1976, 117 & fn. 59): (1) mnjb.t with nb hrgl.

146 mjb.t



till GR usually mjnb (masc., cf. JNES 36, 1977, 150f.), although (7) mjb occurs again in the late NK also: both in pap. (Doomed Prince 8:4, cf. LES 8:3) and ostr. ( Janssen 1975, 322).
nb1: The original form of our word has been much disputed. In E. Edel’s (AÄG
lvii Nachtrag to §34 & 17, §34; 1986, 32) view (pace Hodge 1976, 20–21; 1981,
408; 1992, 204), the OK writing with the hrgl. jb (heart) was used actually for *jnb
(Hodge: var. *j3b!), thus OK mjb.t would act. have to be read *mjnb.t (cf. also Jans
sen 1975, 322–323, §92 & fn. 57; Osing 2001, 576), which can hardly "t the earliest
attestation mnjb.t (III./IV.), where we should thus read an improbable *mnjnb.t.
E. Kühnert-Eggebrecht (1969, 3) surveyed all vars. that, in her view, “sind sämtliche
Schreibungen mjnb.t zu lesen”. P. Lacau (1970, 38–39, §18), in turn, assumed in OK
mjb.t (IV.) an instance of the change of -j- < -n-, the hrgl. mj- in his opinion re#ect
ing an older *ml-/*mn- (!), which he considered justi"ed in the light of MEg. mnjb
(MK cof"n, Lacau 1906 II, 13, nr. 20) and mjnb (Sinuhe R 160). Against Barta’s
view (“vielleicht . . . mjnb, das erst vom M.R. an vorkommt, nur eine andere Schreibung des alten
mjb.t-Beiles”), Drenkhahn (1976, 119 & fn. 65) distinguished two etymons: mjb.t vs.
mjnb (not necessarily to be explained from the former). Similarly, D. Meeks (AL
77.1652 & 1655: cf. JNES 36, 1977, 150f.): “mjb.t . . . peut-être un mot différent de mjnb”.
The resolution of all these controversies is, however, only possible if we assume a
reading of OK mjb.t as mrb.t (with respect to the value mr of the sign W19 mj
in the early OK), which was accepted already by C. T. Hodge (1992, 211): “the
reading can only be m-r-b-t”. The variation of OK -r- ~ -n- can only reveal an *-l
corroborated also by the Bed. cognate (m-l-w < *m-l-b). MEg. mjnb and the late
NK reappearence of mjb probably cover *mlb. This is why Edel’s (1986, 31) purely
speculative Cpt. *mNbw, pl. *mNbooue breaks down.
nb2: For a description of the object see :liwa 1975, 22–24, §1.
! The *-l- in the root is con"rmed by the correct etymology discovered by V. Bla&ek (1990 MS Bed., 5–6, #9; Blz. & Boisson 1992, 20): OEg. mjb.t < mrb.t [*mlb-t] is cognate with Bed. (to")-melaú “(die) kleine
Axt” [ Munzinger] = mallo “Axt” [Krockow] = málau (f ), pl. málawa “kleine Axt” [Almkvist 1885, 45] = maláw ~ maláû, pl. málawa [-w < *-b reg.] “Axt, kleines Beil” [ Rn. 1895, 170] = m"álau, pl. m"alãwa
“adze” [ Rp. 1928, 217] = mallo (f ), pl. mallauw"a “axe” [ Hds. 1996,
92], which, being the only known parallel to Eg. mjb.t, A. Zaborski (2000, 152) is inclined to regard as an Eg. loan-word.
nb1: The change of -w < *-b is reg. in Bed. The correspondence of Eg. b = Bed. w is also
attested elsewhere. Bed. maláw might have derived from *malab via *malav ~ *mala1.
nb2: OEg. *mlb-t and Bed. maláw have probably nothing to do with CCh.: Buduma
màràH “lance” [Brt.-Trn. 1993, 134].
! Any other etymology is either unproven or erroneous: " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 23), P. Lacau (1970, 38–39, §18), and E. Edel (1986, 29–30) saw in it a nomen instr. with a pre"x m-, but they were unable to identify the underlying simplex, which Lacau de"ned as *nb/*lb, although he also confessed that “l’étymologie du mot nous échappe”. Edel treated late OK mjnb.jt (VIII.) < *mjnb.wt as “die ausführlichste Schreibung” re#ecting the pattern m-ABC-wt > -yt of nomina instr. " 2. G. Jéquier (1921, 147; 1921, 271 & fn. 5) assumed in MK mnjb a compound of the prep. (!) m- “pour” (!) + nbj “former, façonner,
mjb.t 147



bâtir”, since “une hache de menuisier est en effet un outil ‘pour façonner’ le bois”. Clearly false. " 3. L. Homburger’s (1929, 158; 1930, 284) etymology for Eg. mjnb Ful (Peul) dyambe-re, pl. dyambe “hâche”) is evidently false. Later Homburger (1931, 253) equated Eg. mjnb with Nub. gambu “hâche”. Unconvincing. " 4. C. T. Hodge (1992, 211 & 220–222, §6), following Grapow, supposed OEg. mrb.t to be a nomen instr. derived with a pre"x m- from a root *lb, which Hodge identi"ed with his Lislakh (AA-IE) **l-b “to pierce, cut, strike”, suggesting very problematic parallels.
nb: Such as Eg. 3b “"ngernail” (LP, Wb I 7, 21) & 3b.t “chisel” (sic after Shorter,

ent (albeit less convincing) inner Eg. etymologies for it, cf. also J. F. Quack (1997,

geachtet, geehrt” and combined it with mjn.t “Art Gewässer” (PT, Wb, q.v.) as well
as mjn “Trank aus Weinbeeren” (GR, Wb, q.v.), in which Goedicke (1957, 66)
contra Meeks (1999, 580–1) – saw a masc. form of mjn.t “ein Getränk” (Lit. MK,

to render OK mjn (0r) (in his view, “closely related to an activity in the !elds of art”) as
“companion, attaché” (explained from the original meaning “one who is attached,

Eg. mn.w “monument” (OK, Wb, q.v.) or mnj.w “throne-room (?)” (cf. Wb II 75,

thither” (CD 174b) as if we had to do with an old compound of *m-n3 “in this”

C. de Wit (1956, 116) rendered GR mjn.tj in Dendera IV 56:9 as “a kind of "eld”,

nb: The etymology of NOm. *m5çz- “cow” [ Mlt.] is highly disputed:
(1) There seems to be a great confusion in the handling of the re#exes of NOm. miz
“Rind” (above) and NOm. *min‰- “cattle” [GT ]: Gofa mín‰-o “Rind” [ Rn.] ! Kefoid
*min‰- [GT ]: Kaffa min‰-. “bestiame bovino (?)”, cf. min‰-if. “sterco di bovini”
[Crl.] = min‰-o “cattle” [Lmb.], Sns. min‰-3 [d’Abbadie/Crl.] = min‰-. “vacca”
[Beke/Crl.] = m5nz-a “cattle” [Lmb.], Anf. mints-. “bestiame bovino” [Crl.] =
mints-o “cow, cattle” [ Flm., Lmb.], Guba minz-a “cow, head of cattle” [ Flm.],
Naga min‰-o “id.” [ Flm.] (Kefoid: Flm. 1987, 146, §5) ! Sheko m5n‰-o “cows, cattle”
[Lmb.] (NOm.: Lmb. 1993, 106). The re#exes of both NOm. roots are usually
mentioned together in Omotic etymologies by L. Reinisch (1888, 318), E. Cerulli
(1929, 33; 1938 III 80; 1951, 471–2), H. Fleming (1987, 146), M. Lamberti (1993,
100, 106) as if the coll. NOm. *min‰- “cattle” had derived from a reduplication
(*mim‰- < *mimz-?) of NOm. *miz-. On the other hand, NOm. *min‰- “cattle”
(palatalized < *ming-?) is fairly close to ES: Amh. mänga, Gafat mänga “#ock,
herd”, which Praetorius (1879, 169) derived from *nhg “to guide, conduct”, while
D. Appleyard (1977, 26/68) prefers a Cushitic borrowing, cf. LECu.: Afar mang-o
“herd” < mag- be full”.
(2) L. Reinisch (1888, 318) equated the NOm. root with Cpt. mase, mesiA“bos
vitulus”. Incorrect both phonologically and semantically, the underlying Eg. being
msj “to bear (child)”.
(3) H. G. Mukarovsky (1987, 135) compared it with Sha nísí mú rà¬ó" “Kuh”
[ Jng. 1970, 288], which is false, since the latter lit. means “female of cattle”, cf.
Sha nísí “weiblich” [ Jng.].
(4) M. Lamberti (1993, 100; 1993, 355; LS 1997, 473–4) derived Wlt. m5za, Sns.
m5nz-a (treating the sibilant as a “formative suf"x”) from an OCu. (Cu.-Om.) *m3l
“to milk” (sic). The segmentation of -z- is unfounded. Moreover, the shift of Om.
*-n- < older *-l- cannot be accepted on historical phonological grounds. A similar
position has been taken by Philippson (2003 MS, 3) who assumed “an -s- increment”
added to a root *m5- attested in Chara & Yemsa mi(y)-, Kafa m5m-, Mao: Sezo &
Hozo "im(m)-, which is equally dubious, since the shift of *-z- > -y- is well known
in NOm., while the Mao form represents a distinct root.
(5) V. É. Orel & O. V. Stolbova (1992, 182; HSED #1809) ECh.: Birgit m$zo
“ox” combine with Eg. m3.t (coll.) “stalled cattle” (MK, FD 123) = “Vieh, Herde”
(Wb II 185). Incorrect both phonologically and semantically (rejected already by
G. Takács 1996, 443, #6.1; 1996, 140). Orel and Stolbova ignored that MEg.
m3.t “stalled cattle” is a secondary meaning developed from OEg. m3.t “byre”
(FD 123) = “Viehhof, Stall” (OK, Wb II 185). Moreover, Eg. -3 vs. ECh.: Birgit
-‰ seem irregular.
(6) A. Militarev (SED II 200–1, #148) af"liated NOm. “cow” with the re#exes (denot
ing “goat” and “antelope”) of his AA *ma«i(n)„- “kind of ungulate” (see below).

lit.: Skn. 1977, 191 (Ar.-Ch.); SED II 200–1 (Sem.-Ch.-NOm.). A. Militarev
(2005, 87) considers Sem. *ma/i«(a)z- as a mV- pre"x formation from Sem. *«Vnz
“goat” [SED II #35]. L. Kogan (SED l.c.) treats JA m1«azz1, m1«azz2y3, m2«izz1,
m2«izzayy3 “from goats, goats-hair, horn etc.” [ Jastrow 1950, 814] = “was von
Ziegen kommt, Ziegenhaar u. dgl., caprinum” [Levy 1924 III 185] as re#exes of the
same PSem. stem with a “secondary derivation” (adopted also in Sem. lexicography)
from Sem. *«Vnz- “goat” (via the synchronic analysis of JA m1«azz1 < *min-«azz1
“from goats”), which, in his view, “can be only a popular etymology”. Kogan explained
Ar. mir«izz- ~ mir«izz3 “poil "n, duvet sous le poil plus gros (chez les chèvres)”
[BK I 881] as a possible Aramaism.

nb3: Following O. V. Stolbova (1996, 115), A. Militarev (SED l.c.) equated the Chadic
forms with the isogloss of ECh.: Bdy. má*ay “gazelle ourebi” [AJ 1989, 96] !!! SCu.:
Dhl. má«a3e “female topi” [Ehret 1980, 156, #24 with false comparanda] = má«aRe
“female kudu” [EEN 1989, 36], which seems phonologically problematic (Bdy. -*- <

“goat” [ JI 1994 I 80] < AA *m-«-d “1. gazelle, 2. goat” [GT ]. Note that CCh.:
Masa m·-da “goat” [ Mch.] derives from Ch. *m- [ JI l.c.].
nb4: A. Militarev (SED II 200–1, #148) af"liated also NOm. *m5çz- “cow” (see
above) with the re#exes of his AA *ma«i(n)„- “kind of ungulate” (denoting “goat”
and “antelope”).
NB5: SCu.: Dhl. mõ‰o “eland, greater kudu” [EEN 1989, 38] = m.‰o (m.d„o) “sp.
large antelope” [ MSSL 1993, 40, #102] cannot belong here, being a late loan-word
from SNil. (as suggested by EEN l.c.).
" 4. GT: Akk. (mA) ma"išu “eine Schafrasse (?)” [AHW 586] = “(a
breed of sheep)” [CAD m1, 116] or MSA: Jbl. mGy: moG+t “livestock” [ Jns. 1981, 175] are probably out of question.
mjz.t “Leber” (PT, Wb II 44, 11) = “liver” (FD 105; cf. AEO II 245*–249*, §598) = “Leber (Mensch, Tier)” (GHWb 326; ÄWb I 513–5).
nb: The word occurs in great number of instances in the OK offering lists, mostly
written the alphabetical signs m + z, where no -r- (!) was written (ÄWb I 513–5).
158 mjz.t



We also know that the hrgl. mj (W19) had already lost its old mr value (Kahl 1994,
801, W19: value mj already in the archaic period, cf. also FÄW 176–177) by that
time when they began to write mjz.t “liver” occasionally with W19 too, let alone
the common and well-attested erosion of old r > j in the OK (AÄG 56, §128).
G. Roquet (1979, 442–3, 437–8) brings two exx., in which the -r- was written
alphabetically, namely late OK (Dyn. V offering list) mrz.t and CT I 289c (T1C)
mrz.t, which are hardly suf"cient for setting up an etymon *mrz.t (accepted also in
NBÄ 695, n. 793; AL 79.1164; Peust 1999, 140), since even if there was formerly
an -r- in our word, it must have certainly been long lost by the late OK and MK,
and henceforth these two pseudohistorical forms hardly re#ect the actual spelling
of the word, which was written without the r sign everywhere else during the OK
(numerous exx. listed in ÄWb l.c.). In spite of CT I 289c (T1C) mrz.t, a number
of recent standard works (DCT 162 & 174; Kahl 1992, 111) stick to assuming OK
mjz.t. Similarly rightly assumes W. Westendorf (1962, 32–33) the OK wtg. mz.t
to be a defective form of mjz.t. P. Kaplony (1974, 224) "nds only mjz.t in Abusir.
The problem of *mrz.t strikingly resembles the phenomenon observed, e.g., with
the OEg. root bnj, where usually a process of old bnr > later bnj is accepted. As
shown, however, by W. Vycichl (1951, 71; 1978, 73; 1983, 29), W. Schenkel (1965,
114–115), and H. Satzinger (1999, 144, fn. 8), the original root might have been
bnj (OK when -r does not appear in most cases), which was replaced then by a
false bnr in the later times (MK) due to a “pseudohistorization” (Vycichl 1951) or
“archaizing orthography ( graphie archaïsante)” (Vycichl 1983) or “hypercorretcion”
(Satzinger). By analogies (where the historic process of erosion of r > j indeed took
place), the scribes of the MK might have felt bnj too as a development from an
earlier *bnr (which actually never existed from an etymological viewpoint).
! Hence: Dem. mws “Leber” (DG 157) " OCpt. maouseA~ maousi “an internal organ: (?) liver” (CED 95; AEO II 245*; exx. apud Richter 1998, 138) = “ein inneres Organ, wohl: Leber” (KHW 107) = “(prob.) foie” (DELC 127) = “ein Organ in der Bauchhöhle: Leber (?)” (Spg.

an eventual connection of AA *may„- “liver” [ Dlg.] to the etymon of Ar. myz II

uncritically adopting the reading of Eg. mjz.t as mrz.t suggested by G. Roquet (1979,

Brugsch (quoted by Horrack 1894, 143–4) assumed a connection to Eg. jmstj “einer der vier Horussöhne, Schutzgott der Eingeweide” (OK, Wb I 88) based on the old (false) rendering of mjz.t as “great intestine” (Chabas) = “(perhaps act. some) internal organ of the animals body, perhaps the stomach” (Horrack).
nb: In the Canopic jars, mjz.t “liver” (with few exceptions) was indeed identi"ed
with Imsety (presiding over the embalmed viscera), but hardly because of a real
etymological connection, “since paranomasia has here played an unmistakeable
part” (AEO II 247*; Ghalioungui 1981, 15).
" 2. H. Grapow (1914, 23), P. Lacau (1970 phon., 39, §19; 1970, 150, #406), and W. Vycichl (1983, 127) supposed an m- pre"x in Eg. mjz.t, but they were unable to identify the root (*jz ~ *wjz or sim.), which mjz.t might have originated in.

ECh.: Sokoro meíld-nm “deine Leber” [Lks. 1937, 36]. But the correspondence of Ch. *-d vs. OEg. -z is irregular.
nb: The position of ECh.: Sarwa ngál-màndà, Gadang mùyò “liver” (both derived
in JI 1990 MS, 6, #113 from Ch. *m-l-d) is uncertain. It has not been researched
whether Gadang -y- can be < *-yy- < *-yz- (as in the case of NOm. *mayz

Blackman (1916, 69): since mjzw.t “produces assonance with” Eg. nsw “king” in PT 724a–b, it “is likewise a derivative of ” Eg. sw.t “eine P#anze: Art Binse” (MK, Wb IV 58), “mj- being a pre!x”.

Similarly, P. Wilson (PL 412): “a connection with either swt or nswt seems possible”. False.
nb: As rightly noted by A. H. Gardiner (quoted by Blackman 1916, 69, fn. 3, cf.
RT 33, 75), mjzw.t cannot be a derivative of sw.t, as the hrgl. W19 is only used in
m- formations when either the 1st radical is j- or when the 1st radical becomes j-.
" 3. P. Lacau (1970, 38 & fn. 2) suggested a “prototype” *m-nzw.t originating in OEg. nzw “roi du Haute Égypte” (see nsw) with a pre"x m-, which later shifted to m-jzw.t with the rare change of Eg. n > j. In his view, mjzw.t is “à comparer sans doute avec métathèse le nom de couronne nws” (Lacau, RT 31, 1909, 30, l. 2 & 7). " 4. D.

Eingang in ägyptische Tempel mit lokaler Bedeutung fand ”. Henceforth, he identi"ed mjk.t “mit Vorbehalt” with Meroitic mkdj “Göttin” (“aus mk ‘Gott’ und kdj ‘Frau’ kontaminiert”), which was later personi"ed. Accepting this theory, Handoussa (1987, 101–5) saw in this “egyptianized” name (perhaps mjktj?) a “vivid example” of a local divinity, which “the theologians of Egyptianized Nubia tried to interrelate . . . with the Egyptian pantheon”.

Traditionally (e.g. Wb II 45; EG 1957, 132, §178) explained as a compound prep. consisting of Eg. m “in” + « “hand”, which is
widely accepted in Egyptian philology. " 2. I. Eitan (1928, 48; 1929, 47, 49), followed by P. Lacau (1913, 219, §451; 1970, 17), compared it with Ar. ma« ~ ma«a “avec”, cf. also
ma«3 “ensemble”, ma«iyy-at- “1. propriété conjonctive de la copula
tive, 2. compagnie, juxtaposition” [BK II 1125], both projecting to Ar. the same compound as in Eg. m-«. Ar. ma«a is cognate with Ug.
m« II (adv.) “as one, together” [ DUL 519] (cf. Renfroe 1992, 128)
and distantly probably also with NBrb.: Mzg. )m: a-mu [-Ø < *-«

[Ehret] < AA *m-« “(to be) together” [GT ].
nb1: Eitan did not even exclude that the isolated Ar. prep. “may have come over directly
from Egypt”. But contrary to Eitan, such an Eg.-Ar. comparison would exclude the
inner Eg. etymology of Eg. m«.
nb2: Similarly to Eitan, V. Bla&ek (2004, 12, §9) assumes in Ar. ma«a (“a formal
parallel”, in his view, to Ar. lad3 ~ laday “chez, auprès” [BK II 984] derived in
DELC 145 from li- “to” + yad- “hand”) the same construction as in Eg. m« (above)
and mdj (m “in” + *d “hand”, lit. “at hand”) as well as IE *me-“h(s)ri- “near”, lit.
“at hand”, P. Lacau (1913, 219, §451; 1970, 17), in turn, derived Eg. m«, Ar. ma«a,

m« 165



nb3: The connection of Hbr. «am and Ar. ma«a (supported also in GB 594; MM
1983, 180; KB 839) is dubious. On the other hand, J. Aistleitner (WUS 233–4, #2041)
af"liated NWSem. *«Vm “mit, bei” with Ar. «an “von, für, mit, zu”. Note that Ar.
ma«a has also a var. «am (via met.?) in the dial. of Maroccan Huwara (GB 594).
nb4: Ma’a -mu"i was wrongly af"liated by Ch. Ehret (1980, 159, #52) with Brg.
mu«ud- “to pommel” and Dhl. mu2u«-u<d- “to masturbate” (rendered by Tosco
1991, 143 more correctly as “to pull down the foreskin”) and explained from his
SCu. *mu«(ut)- “to handle lightly (esp. in a sexual sense)”.

lit. for Eg.-Sem.: Ember 1926, 5, #1; 1930, #3.c.3, #5.a.19; Vcl. 1934, 55; 1958,
372; 1983, 108; Clc. 1936, #623; Chn. 1947, #57; HSED #1768.
nb1: Cf. Ar. mi«wal- “barre de fer pointue avec laquelle on brise les pierres” [BK
II 412] = mi«wal- “a pickaxe or stone-cutter’s pick, the iron implement, a large
fa"s-, with which are pecked or hollowed out rocks or great masses of stones” [Lane
2201] = “Spitzhaue” [Clc.] = “pic” [Chn.] with a shift of -b- > -w-?
nb2: W. F. Albright (1919, 179, #11), followed later by W. Leslau (1987, 84), com
bined the Geez and Ar. noun with Akk. (nA, jB) bêlu “etwa: Waffe” [AHW 120],
which is uncertain. Following Dillmann, Albrigh derived Ar. mi«bal-at- “arrow with
a thick head” from «abila “to be thick”.
nb3: Already Th. Nöldeke (1910, 55) separated Geez m3«2bal “arrow” from Geez
mab«al “instrument”. Following him, A. Ember (1926, 5, #1) treated Ar. mi«bal-at
“a kind of arrow” as a borrowing from Geez m3«2bal “arrow”.

nb4: P. Fronzaroli (1977, 160–4), in turn, saw the source of Geez ma«bäl “arrow”
and Ar. mi«bal- “cutting tool”, mi«bal-at- “large arrow point” in Sem. *«bl > Ar.
«abala “to cut”, «abl3"- “white rock, narrow strip in the blackness of the earth, the
stones of which are white”, "a«bal- “white stone or mountain of which the stones
are white” [ Frz.], Dathina «ib3l (pl.) “heaps of corn” [ Frz.] ! Sqt. pl. «ébhaléten
“sharp stones”, cf. má«bher “rock” [Lsl. 1938, 293, 296], Mhr. "ayb1l [ Frz.] = "áyb2l
“#int(stone)” [ Jns. 1987, 10] ! Geez «ub3l “hill” [Lsl. 1987, 54]. Fronzaroli set up
two PSem. etymons, namely *«abl-at- “a white stone” vs. *«ibal- “white stones”
(supposed source of the name of Ebla), both carrying the basic meaning “a rock
of clear, shining appearence similar to #int but coarse-grained, prob. a variety of
granite”. In Fronzaroli’s view, the occasional use of this rock as #intstone explains
the Mhr. and Sqt. data, while the Ar. re#exes suggest the stone *«abl- was used for
making baldes and points.
nb5: The authors of SISAJa I, #96 considered Geez ma«bal to be the met. of Geez
mab«al (lit. “working tool”) explained from Sem. *p«l ~ *b«l “make, do”.
nb6: W. Leslau (1987, 54, 84) assumed in Geez the following scenarios: (1) Geez
m3«2bal(t) derives directly from Geez «bl II «abbala “to make, do” (which Leslau
linked to Sem. *«ml “to work”). (2) Geez m3«2bal(t) is met. of Geez mab«al ~
mab«2l “iron tool, axe”, cognate with Ug. b«l “to make, manufacture, work” [ DUL
203] !! ESA b«l “to work, excavate bedrock (travailler, creuser le soubassement
rocheux)” [SD 26].
nb7: V. É. Orel & O. V. Stolbova (HSED #1768) combined Ar. mi«bal-at- and
Eg. m«b3 with WCh.: Bole "umoul “wegschleudern” [Lks. 1971, 133] < AA *mi
«Vbal- “arrow, spear”, which is untenable. Elsewhere, more convincingly Orel and
Stolbova (1990, 80, #51) compared Bole "umoul with Ar. nabala “jeter, lancer des
traits, des dards”, nabl-at- “une #èche” [BK II 1187–8]. For Bole "umoul cf. also
WCh.: Klr. o ìl “werfen (Stock usw.), bewerfen” [ Jng. 1970, 351] = “to throw”
[ Nwm. 1977, 186] ! Tng. bal “spear with a long blade” [ Jng. 1991, 70], Kupto
bùuléy “werfen, schleudern” [Leger 1992, 18], Grm. bèel-áalà “to throw” [Schuh
1978, 118] !! CCh.: Glavda bal “to throw, cast” [ RB 1968, 13] ! Zelgwa mbál “to
throw an arrow” [Brt. 1995, 202], Mada bál “to shoot” [ Rsg. 1978, 324, #635]
! Puss bili “lancer, jeter (une seule chose)” [ Trn. 1991, 79], perhaps Mbara vlà
[vl- < *bl-?] “jeter” & vùl “lancer, jeter” [ TSL 1986, 280] ! Masa b5l “couteau
de jet” [Ctc. 1983, 38]. Note that these Ch. cognates are to be distinguished from
Ch. *Hal- “(to shoot an) arrow” [Stl.] (discussed below), which Stolbova (2005, 35)
erroneously equated with Ar. nabala.
nb8: Assuming that Geez m3«2bal “arrow etc.” [Lsl.] and Eg. m«b3 are unrelated
to any of the above listed forms, the two diverse basic meanings of Geez m3«2bal
~ m3«2balt “1. tool” vs. “2. arrow” being due to contamination, we cannot exclude
a derivation from AA *«-b-l “to shoot” (or sim.) [GT ], cf. WCh.: Hausa Híllà “to
throw” [Stl. 1996, 27] ! Ron *Hol “schießen” [GT ]: Fyer Hol, Bks. Hol, DB Hol (Ron:
Jng. 1968, 12, #143; 1970, 392) !! CCh.: Daba Hàl “to throw (an arrow)” [Brt. 1995,
225] !! ECh.: Sarwa Hál3w, Gadang H3l$ “lance (de guerre)” (Somray gr.: JI 1993
MS, 8, #144). Note that Ch. *H is reg. < *«/*%/*"/*h + *b. O. V. Stolbova (1996,
27) prefers equating this Ch. root with Ch. *mb-l “to throw” [GT ] (presented above),
although the initial labials (*H- vs. *b-) are different.
! Other etymologies cannot be accepted.
nb1: L. Homburger (1929, 168) compared Eg. m«b3 with Bantu (sic) u-goba “cro
chet”, while in another paper (1930, 283) she equated Eg. m«b3 with Ful (Peul)
gawal “lance”. Absolutely baseless.
nb2: H. Satzinger (1999, 376) considered GR m«b3 as a Graphie of *m«b and af"li
ated it with Eg. «bb.t > «bb “Speer” (MK, NK, GR, Wb I 178, 13) as well as ndb
“verwunden” (BD), which he derived from AA *dVp “ausstoßen, werfen”.
m«b3 175



m«b3 “30” (OK, Wb II 46, 15), vocalized *má«ba3 (Vrg. 1973 Ib, 32)
" Cpt.: (O) mop in mop-tie “35” (,erný & Kahle & Parker 1957, 94) > (S) maab, (A) maabe, (B) map etc. “30” (KHW 87). ! Origin not clear. One of the “hard words”. Presumably enlarged by a pre"x m- (as speculatively assumed in Grapow 1914, 23; ,erný 1937, 57; DELC 108 without identifying the etymon). " 1. W. F. Albright (1918, 92) & A. Ember (1926, 5, #2; 1930, #5.a.20): Eg. m«b3 < *«br identi"ed with PB Hbr. m2«ubb3r “passage” [Albright] =
“intercalated” [Ember].
nb1: Cp. also OHbr. *ma«db3r, st. cstr. ma«abdr “1. das Einfahren, Vorübergehen,
2. Ort des Übergangs”, ma«2bb3r3 “Furt”, JAram. ma«2bb2r3 “Furt, Fähre”, NHbr.
m1«db3r “pass(age), crossing”, m2«ubberet “pregnant”, š3n3 m2«ubberet “leap year
(in the Hebrew calendar consisting of 13 lunar months)” (Hbr.: GB 442; Šapiro
1963, 354).
nb2: This comparison leads us to Sem. *«br “to transgress” [GT ], which is semanti
cally dif"cult to explain, cf. Akk. eb1ru “überschreiten”, ebertu “jenseitiges Ufer”
[AHW 182] !! Hbr. «br “vorübergehen, überschreiten”, «1ber “das Jenseitige eines
Ufers, Tales, Meeres” [GB 558, 442, 560] !! ESA: Sab. «br “to transgress, pass a
boundary”, «br-n “other side (?)” [SD 11], Qtb. «br “side” [ Ricks 1982, 170].
Albright guessed whether “can it refer originally to the number of days in a lunar revolution
or ‘passage’?”, while Ember surmized that Eg. m«b3 “perhaps denoted primarily a month
consisting of thirty days . . . Eg. m«b3 has very early lost its original astronomical connotation,
and survives only as ‘thirty’ ”.
" 2. A. Loprieno (1986, 1309): the original meaning of Eg. m«b3
might have been *“Komplettheit”, which he derived from Eg. «b3
“to present, provide” (OK, FD 41) = “ausgestattet sein” (Wb I 177, 5; GHWb 135). Semantically very weak. " 3. GT: the primary meaning of Eg. m«b3 presumed by A. Ember
(1926, 5, #2) as *”lunar month of thirty days” "nds typological support in NBrb.: Nefusa u-y@r “30” coming from u-y@r “lune” [ Vcl.] = u-yér “luna nuova” [Bgn. 1942, 240] “à cause des 30 jours de mois” (DELC 108, cf. Wlf. 1954, 31). In the light of these parallels, the coincidence of Eg. m«b3 < *«br ~ *«rb (?) with Cu.-Om. *HarP
“moon” [GT ] is highly noteworthy.
nb1: Attested in Agaw *"arb- > *"arf- “moon” [Apl.]: Bilin arb-ã [ Mnh.] = "2rbá

Flm. 1974, 90, #16; 1976, 320).
nb2: H. C. Fleming (1974, 90, #16) compared the Cu.-Om. root with Sem.: Ug.
«rp-t “cloud” [ WUS 243, #2102]. Cp. still Akk. urpatu “cloud” [AHW 1432], Hbr.
«ar3pel “dark clouds” [GB 621] !!! Bed. afra “cloud” [ Rn. 1895, 9]. For Ug.-Bed.
see Ehret (1995, 353, #694). If Bed.-Sem. *«-r-p “cloud” is related to Cu.-Om.
*H-r-P “moon”, we have probably to give up combining the latter with Eg. m«b3
“30” (Eg. -b- + Sem. *-p-).
176 m«b3



m«n “verschönern (von Stöcken) (?)” (late NK Pap. Anastasi IV, rt.
17:3, Wb II 47, 5) = “to embellish” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 216) = “embellished” (DLE I 213) = “verschönern” (GHWb 327).
nb: For a different interpretation cf. Junge 2003, 259, n. 528.
! As pointed out by H. Grapow (1914, 23) and R. Caminos (l.c.), it derives from Eg. «n “schön (sein)” (MK, Wb I 190), whose origin
is disputed.
nb: The etymologies offered so far are: (1) A. Ember (1913, 115, #52) suggested
an etymological connection with the lost PEg. *«( j)n “eye” quoting parallels like
Germ. schön ~ schauen or Hbr. r3"$ “proper, worthy” < Sem. *r"y “to see”. (2)
C. Brockelmann (1932, 102, #14): ~ Ar. pl. "a-«y3n- “die Notabeln”. (3) O. Rössler
(1971, 291): Eg. «jn (sic) equated with Ar. zyn “verschönern, schmücken”, but there
is no convincing evidence for Eg. « ~ Sem. *z (cf. EDE I 357–361). (4) GT: perhaps
~ HECu. *el- “to be better” [ Hds. 1989, 409]? HECu. *el- < *«al-? (5) GT: of
extra-AA origin? Cf. PCKhoisan *!an “good” [Baucom 1972, 20]?
m«n “(Hände und Füße) schlagen, Bastonade geben” (XX., Pap. Mayer
A, Wb II 47, 6) = “Fesselung” (Grapow 1914, 23) = “twisting of limbs” (Peet 1930, 21) = “a torture applied to witnesses, suspects, and culprits” (Smith 1978, 362) = “to be twisted” (DLE I 216) = “drehen, schrauben” (Helck, LÄ II 279 after Peet) = “(denotes a corporal punishment affecting a criminal’s arms and feet)” (Willems 1990, 34, fn. 29) = “verdrehen (bei der Folter)” (GHWb 327) = “etw. winden, (ver)drehen” ( Junge 1999, 351) = “schlagen” (WD I 85 after Willems l.c.). R. Caminos (1958, 123, §192) found the same word in the Chronicle of Prince Osorkon: [m]«n “to beat, bastinado or
perhaps twist (as a form of punishment)”.
nb: The -«- was apparently to be read as certain GW forms (in Pap. Mayer A 3–4
passim, 3:6) betray, therefore mn (proposed in DLE or by Willems) or mnn (Helck,
LÄ II 279) can hardly be correct, albeit not to be excluded either.
! Reading and meaning debated. Origin obscure.
nb: As R. Caminos (l.c., fn. 1) rightly states: “the exact meaning of mn or m«n remains to be
determined, at all events, the verb denotes the in"iction of some form of physical punishment”.
" 1. H. Grapow (1914, 23): enlarged by pre"x m- < Eg. «nn “umwinden
(?)” (PT 425, Wb II 192, 9), which is certainly valid for Eg. m«nn
(cf. the following entry).
nb: H. Smith (1978, 362), W. Helck (l.c.), and R. Hannig (GHWb l.c.) suggest
(reading -nn) a direct identi"cation with Eg. m«nn (q.v.).
" 2. H. Willems (1990, 34 & fn. 29) read mn and supposed to have found its older etymon in MK mn “to sever (neck as capital punishment)” (stela no. 9 of Sirenput I in the Heqaib sanctuary). Improbable.
nb: The other instance of MK mn occuring in CT VI 162k has been rendered
diversely. AECT II 169: a spelling of mnj “to die”; AL 78.1703 and Willems: “être
séparé”; Barguet (1986, 343): spelling of mn “to suffer”.
" 3. GT: if, however, the rendering “to beat” is correct, the following AA parallels should be noted:

nb: The exx. of Dyn. XX lack -«-, while the GR one has it combined with m- (EG

! From the same root: (1) m«nn “das aus zwei Stricken zusam

178 m«nn



nb1: The traditional reading m«nn (Wb, GHWb) is doubtful. It is perhaps in#u
enced by the hypothetical derivation from Eg. «nn (below). Both NEg. mnn (GW)
“gewunden sein” (Wb) and mnn.wj “die beiden Verschlungenen” (Wb) were writ
ten without -«-, in which W. Westendorf (1989, 109) supposes a loss (Schwund, sic!)
of -«-. However, both J. ,erný (CED 85) and W. Vycichl (DELC 116) transcribed
consistently all re#exes of the root as mnn.
nb2: Vocalized in NBÄ 209, 682, n. 766 as *m'«n)/un'(y) in the pattern *m's35m'w
of nomina agentis and instr., hence XX. *ma(")n5n2 (Zeidler 1999 II, 167, fn. 2).
W. Vycichl (DELC 116), however, assumed a pass. part. *mann$n.aw
nb3: Pfortenbuch m«« “Schlangenseil, aus dessen Windungen die Stunden entstehen”
(Kákosy, LÄ VI 1363) has hardly anything to do with «m.w “Verschlinger” (Hornung
1980 II, 194–5), but may be rather a strongly abbreviated var. of m«nn, which
W. Westendorf (1989, 109) explained with an (unjusti"ed) Lautübergang n > 3 > «.
! Hence: Cpt.: (S) manin, mallin, malil “band, cord” (CD 176a) = “Band, Schnur” (NBÄ 682, n. 766) = “Biegung, Windung” (KHW 95) derived by H. Smith (1978, 362) directly from NK m«n (XX.,
above). This etymology is absent in CED.
nb1: The dissimilation of -n- > -l- was in#uenced by m- (Osing, LÄ III 948). Or
vice versa (*m-l-l > m-n-n due to m-?)?
nb2: The 2nd sense of Cpt. (B) monmen “1. bewegen, 2. #echten, drehen” (KHW
95, 519) = “1. to (be) shake(n), twisted” (CD 176a) = “1. mouvoir, ébranler, 2. tressé
(?%(!/%'7)” (DELC 116) may be due to a late contamination of two two distinct
roots (cf. also Eg. mnmn “to move”, below).
! Etymology highly disputable. " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 7) derived mnn from nn (sic), cf. Eg. nn.t “replis (?)” (CT, AL 78.2131) = “coils (?)” (DCT 232), which he considered to be related with nnw% (sic) as its “forme élargi” (!). " 2. W. Vycichl (1933, 178, #8), J. Osing (NBÄ 209), and J. Zeidler (1999 II, 167, fn. 2) assumed a root m«nn originating from Eg. «nn
(rope det.) “umwinden (?)” (PT 425b, Wb II 192, 9; GHWb 144; ÄWb I 271–2) = “1. sich winden, wenden, 2. umwinden” (NBÄ 209) = “to bound up, wind round, surround, coil up” (CT, DCT 73), cf. hence «nn.w “coil, ribbon” (CT II 115c, DCT 73) and «nn.wj “Bez.
zweier Schlangen, die umwinden” (NK, Wb I 192, 10). The latter occurs in Amduat II 19 in connection with mnn.wj (written without -«-). This derivation was apparently abandoned by J. ,erný (CED
85) and W. Vycichl (DELC 116) who assume a root mnn.
nb1: Was the similarity of PT-CT «nn vs. NK m«nn pure chance? Was the occa
sional -«- of NK-GR m«nn ~ mnn perhaps due to a secondary contamination, a
false Volksetymologie?
nb2: Vycichl (l.c.) equated Eg. «nn mistakenly with SBrb.: Hgr. e-qqen, caus. s$3en,
habit. s$3$n “umwinden, (ver)binden”. Phonologically incorrect (Brb. *q- + Eg. «-).
Moreover, the Brb. root is cognate with Eg. qn “weben (?)” (GR, Wb V 50, 5), qnj.

Untenable (Eg. 3 & Sem. *z). (4) V. É. Orel & O. V. Stolbova (1992, 176): Eg. «3
equated with ECu. *"1g- “to watch, look out” [Sasse 1982, 67]. Unconvincing both
phonologically (Eg. «- + ECu. *"-) and semantically. Besides, ECu. *"1g- is related
to SBrb.: Hgr. agg “bewachen” as suggested by O. Rössler (1964, 207).

229) = “prospérer” (Ceugney) = “glücklich, eig. gedeihend (?)” (Erman), which was
erroneously derived in some early works from Eg. rd “to grow” (Ceugney 1880, 7;
Erman 1896, 35), is probably just a miswritten form due to a contamination of
m«r vs. rd “wachsen” (PT, Wb II 462) motivated by their common det. (M31–32)
as supposed by Gardiner (1904, 76) and Langlois (1919, 158, fn. 2). It has therefore
hardly any connection with Sem.: Syr. m2r5d “munitus, tutus” [Brk.] ! Ar. mrd
“7. être audacieux, hardi” [BK II 1088] = “beständig sein” [ Rsl.] (Rsl. 1971, 286:

Spg. KHW 56) to OK m«r (which he falsely read mjr/*mj!r= with G10 for mj-):
mio=k (mjr=k) “du bist glücklich”, miw=tn (mjr=2n) “ihr seid glücklich”, but this
etymology is not commonly accepted as there are a number of alternative pro
posals. Thus, ,erný (CED 78–79) saw in it a contraction from an earlier mnio=,
where explained -io= from j3wj “old age” (rejected in DELC 109). Osing (NBÄ
510): < *mj j3w=, act. “nimm deinen Lobpreis”? Westendorf (KHW 88 & fn. 1):
< jmj «3j=k “mögest du geehrt, groß sein” or < m3«=k. The ideas of Westendorf
and Spiegelberg were declined by Osing because of the missing trace of -«- in the
Vortonsilbe (whereby it should have been *maio=).

“perfection, excellence, improvement” [ Jastrow 1950, 817] is striking, but probably only accidental.
nb: This sense of the underlying root (Sem. *«ly) is not re#ected in Eg. j«r, whence
m«r might be in principle derived.

[ R!u&i'ka]. Nevertheless, similarly striking is the (equally accidental) coincidence of
Ar. mara«a “2. oindre abondamment d’huile (la tête, les cheveux)” [BK II 1093]
with Eg. (CT VI 5a) m«r “anointed one (of wig)” (DCT 163 contra AECT II 108,

like outer garment (either non-sacral or formal vestment of the high-priest)” [KB
612] in spite of its Sem. etymology.
nb2: C. Ceugney’s (l.c.) derivation of maire “fasciculus alligatus” < m«r.t is false
(cf. CED 88; KHW 99; DELC 119).

1975, 16, §27) = *m'«%°«(w).'t (NBÄ 209) > later *em%å«w.et (Steindorff 1904, 65)
= *m%a«w.@(t) (Lacau 1970, 128–9, §13) = *m'«%°"(w).'t (sic) > *m'"%°"w.'t (NBÄ
746, n. 906) = *m'%)«w.'t (Edel 1986, 30, §1) = *maj%3«.at > *m1%3«.at (Vcl. 1990,
235). Note that the shift of -j- < -«- in m«%«.t > NK mj%«.t was in#uenced by -%
(Lacau l.c., Edel l.c.).
! Whether it survives in Dem. m%w ~ mhw (with the shift of -h- < –) “das Grab” (DG 171, 174:6) > Cpt. (S) mHaa(o)u,AmHaaue, emHaou, (A) mHw (L) mHeeu, (F) emHeou, (B) (e)mHau “tomb, cavern” (CD 212b) = “Grab, Höhle, Gedenkstätte” (KHW 112) is a strongly debated question.
nb1: Most of the leading "gures of Eg. linguistics belong to the proponents of
the continuity between MK m«%«.t vs. Dem.-Cpt. m%w, e.g. G. Steindorff (1889,
108), G. Fecht (1960, 180, §373), P. Lacau (1970, 126, 128), J. Vergote (1973 Ib,
156), E. Edel (1975, 16, §27), J. Osing (NBÄ 209), W. Westendorf (KHW 112),
H. Smith (1978, 361), W. Vycichl (DELC 132; 1990, 234). Others, however, such
m«"3 – m«"«.t 185



as W. Erichsen (DG) and J. ,erný (CED 100), carefully avoided the mention of
m«%«.t in the entry for the Dem.-Cpt. term “perhaps on phonetic grounds” as Smith
(l.c.) surmised, who missed it in CED as a “probable” etymology (with met. of -«-).
A fundamental dif"culty is the gender difference of MK fem. vs. Dem.-Cpt. masc.
forms (cf. Möller 1913, 138, fn. 2; Graefe & Wassef 1979, 117, fn. 33) and that
“weder in m«%«(w).t noch in «%«(w).t scheint das durch das Koptische gesicherte w jemals ausge
schrieben zu sein” (Fecht 1960, 180, §373, fn. 504). Moreover, Dem. «%«j3.t ~ m«%«j.t
are attested, which are clearly distinct from Dem. m%/hw (Graefe & Wassef 1979,
117, fn. 34). Therefore, as W. Vycichl (1990, 235) remarked, m«%«.t “ne peut pas passer
directement à mHaau (S)”. For these reasons, E. Graefe and M. Wassef (1979, 115–7,
also 109, n. j) sharply rejected this equation and combined Dem.-Cpt. m%w (pace
Möller 1913, 138) with Eg. m%j “Grabkammer (?)” (hapax, Ramses III, Wb, q.v.),
see below for further details.
nb2: KHW 523: (O) mHaou(e) “ist zu streichen”, being identical with mhw.t “Fami
lie” (q.v.).
! May be a nomen loci (pre"x m-) as suggested by H. Grapow (1914, 7, 17, 24). Apparently, m«%«.t signi"ed the place of «%«(w), but the
exact de"nition of the underlying etymon is ambiguous: (1) Eg. «%«.w “Denkstein, Grabstein” (XVIII., Wb I 221) = “stela”
(FD 47)?
nb: This solution was preferred by G. Fecht (1960, 180, §373), J. Vergote (1973
Ib, 156), H. Satzinger (p.c., 17 April 1999), and others: “proprement: le lieu où
se trouve la stèle «%«w” (Boreux 1931, 45–46) = “Stelle des Grabsteins” (Osing) =
“where the stela is standing” (Stz.). Eg. m«%«.t denoted the Abydos cenotaphs too
in contrast to Eg. jz “tomb” (PT, FD 29) = “das Grab” (PT, Wb I 126). Rejected
by Osing (NBÄ 747).
(2) Eg. «%« “Haufen” (OK, Wb I 220) = “heap” (FD 47)?
(3) Eg. «%« “to stand (up), erect, rise up” (OK, FD 47)?
nb1: Preferred by Smith (1978, 161), Osing (NBÄ 209), Lacau (1970 phon., 128–9,
§13), and Peust (1997, 269). Lit. “un tombeau développé en hauteur (par opposition
à la tombe souterraine jz)” (Lacau) = “eig. ‘Stehendes’, urspr. wohl als Bezeichnung
für mastaba-artige Gräber” (NBÄ 747).
nb2: V. É. Orel & O. V. Stolbova (1992, 193; HSED #1781) connected, perfectly
falsely, Eg. m«%«.t “tomb” with ECu.: Gwd. may- “to bury” [AMS] !!! CCh.: Musgu
mou “to bury” (sic) [OS! not found in Müller 1886; Lks. 1941; Trn. 1991] ! Lame
mu"u “to bury” (sic) [OS contra Scn. 1982, 320]. Rightly rejected by C. Peust
(1997, 269).
m«q “Art Spiess oder ähnlisches Gerät zum Braten” (XVIII., Wb II
50, 1) = “Grillspieß (bei dem Aufstellen des Feuerbeckens)” ( Junker 1941, 117) = “Bratspieß” (OK, Pusch 1974, 20; so also Junge, LÄ III 833, n. 32) = “Bratspieß, Braten” (Guglielmi, LÄ VI 1290) = “Grillspieß” (Verhoeven 1984, 28; Fischer-Elfert 1986, 76) = “Grill(spieß, auch als Kultgerät)” (GHWb 328; ÄWb I 517) = “roasts on a spit, kebabs, orig.: a spit” (Edfu, PL 416–7).
nb1: Attested already in the OK, from Dyn. V (cf. Junker: Giza V 96; Pusch 1974,
20; Quack 1996, 510, #227; Meeks 1997, 43, #227; ÄWb I 517).
186 m«q



nb2: Should be carefully distinguished from the (sometimes deceitful) writing mg/
m«g3 (Wb II 164, 4) of the Sem. loan-word mq«r “Ofen des Bäckers und seine
Glut” (late NK, Wb II 158, 15; Helck 1971, 515, #124) > (L) mekre “lodern (?)”
(KHW 90), cf. also Verhoeven 1984, 50, fn. 1.
! From the same root: m«q “braten” (NK, GR, Wb II 50, 2–4) = “to
grill” (Zandee 1960, 145, B.4.e) = “braten (als Bestrafung durch Feuer und Schwert)” (Amduat, Hornung 1963 II, 122, n. 8) = “(die spezi"sche Zubereitungsart) am Spieß braten” ( Junge, LÄ III 833, n. 32 after Klebs) = “den Spieß benutzen, am Spieß grillen” (Verhoeven 1984, 52) = “grillen (mit Spieß)” (GHWb 328) = “griller sur une brochette” (Meeks 1997, 43, #227) = “to roast” (PL 417).
nb1: Does it derive as a late denominative verb from OK m«q?
nb2: For the problem of a NK var. *m«g cf. Fecht 1965, 89, fn. 49; Verhoeven
1984, 80.
! Origin disputed. " 1. D. Meeks (1997, 43, #227) and P. Wilson (PL 417) derived it (via m- pre"x of nomina instr.) from Eg. «q “to enter, penetrate”, which
would imply that the OK noun m«q was primary “re"ecting the use of
the spit as sg. which enters/skewers meat portions so that they can be roasted ” (PL).
nb: Dubious. The writing of m«q signi"cantly differs from that of «q.
" 2. J. Hoch (1994, 170–171, #227) treated several late NK examples of m«q “grillen” as var. forms of late NK mgr “to boil, grill” (q.v.).
Hoch overlooked the OK attestation of m«q. Rightly rejected by J.
F. Quack (1996, 510, #227) and D. Meeks (1997, 43, #227). " 3. GT: provided the verb was primary, it represents both phonologically and semantically a perfect match of SBrb.: EWlm. 2-my23 “griller (des grains de céréales) dans leur épi encore vert, 2. être grillé”, hence d-mayo3, pl. i-mdyo3-dn “grains grillés encore verts (de céréales)” [PAM 1998, 230; 2003, 569], Tadghaq & Tudalt a-mdya3 “grilled grains (eaten only when the "rst millet heads are harvested)” [Sudlow 2001, 286]. Note that Brb. *y < *« is reg. (cf. Vcl. 1992).
nb1: Noteworthy is AA *m-w-= “to burn (or sim.)” [GT ] (var. root to the hypothetic
AA *m-«-=?): ES *mwq “to be warm, hot” [GT ] vs. Geez maqaqa “to burn, sting
(e.g. a medicine), burn the throat, cauterize”, Tna. mäqmäq bälä “to burn (pep

[pre"x a-] “cendre” [ Trn. 1977, 19]. The underlying AA root might have contained
medial *-w- instead of ayin. The NOm.-CCh. isogloss *mu=- “ashes” [GT ] also
displays no trace of * -«-.
m«q 187



nb2: Conti Rossini (l.c.) compared the SEOmt. forms also with NOm.: Haruro m1gg
1 “luogo ove l’erba è stata bruciata”, which is perhaps related rather with ECh.:
Mobu me:ge “(se) dessécher” & Ngam mìyèke “dessécher” [Lenssen 1984, 69].
nb3: A further var. root, namely AA *m-k [GT ] appears in ES: Tigre mäk bela,
Tna. mo§ bälä, Amh. mokk alä, mokkäkä “to boil roughly” (ES: Lsl. 1982, 51) !!!
SBrb.: Tadghaq & Tudalt ta-mdk-at “charcoal” [Sudlow 2001, 308] !!! Bed. mukwa
“to burn clay to make pots” [ Hds. 1996 MS, 92].
nb4: Cf. also AA *m-= “to give light” [GT ]: SBrb.: EWlm. ta-m1eqq-it “étincelle”
[ Ncl. 1957, 570] !!! WCh.: NBch. *mukw-/*mu=w- “sun” [Stl.] = *m-k [ JS 1981,
256C]: Miya múkù, Mburku mú=ù, Jimbin mùkwá (NBch.: Skn. 1977, 42; Stl. 1987,
259; JI 1994 II, 312). Note that J.D. Wölfel (1955, 147, §5) directly combined Eg.
sm«q “rösten, braten” (NK, Wb IV 131, 11), apparently ignoring that it is just the
caus. of Eg. m«q, with SBrb.: Hgr. semeqq-et “briller (être brillant: soleil, lune, étoile,
éclair, feu, #amme etc.)” [ Fcd. 1951–2, 1231], EWlm. & Ayr s2m2qq-2t “miroiter,
briller (p.ex. chose/arme bien astiquée)” [PAM 2003, 724]. The segmentation of
the SBrb. root is not evident in the lit. (Fcd.: listed under )mqq PAM: under )smq),
but K.-G. Prasse (p.c., 25 August 2006) con"rms that “semeqqet is not a causative, as
this would require gemination of the m: semmeqqet. This is so also in the Hoggar dialect. So
root: SMGh (Gh = voiced spirant uvular: ghayn). If it is an original causative, this must be
a prehistorical derivative”.
" 4. GT: or, assuming a shift of m«q from an incompatible *m«k, we
might compare Hbr. m«k qal “1. to squeeze (breast), 2. squash (tes
ticles), 3. thrust into (a spear into the ground)” [KB 612].
nb1: The basic sense of the Sem. root was slightly different, cf. MHbr. & JAram.
m«k “to crush” [KB], NHbr. (TTM) m«k “(z)erdrücken” [ Dalman 1922, 245]
= “zerdrücken, zerquetschen” [Levy 1924 III 190] ! Ar. ma«aka “to rub on the
ground, struggle” [KB].
nb2: Hence derive also Hbr. ma«dq3 “stupid (as PN)” [KB 612] ! Ar. ma«(i)k- “sot,
imbécile” [BK II 1129], for which cf. Eg. m3q ("re det.) “der . . . (als spottender?
Beiname)” (late NK, Wb II 33, 8), presumably a var. of m«q. For the problem of
this form see the entry for m3q above.
m«d (or md or perhaps m«f?) “(mng. unknown, perhaps) anvil (?)”
(CT, AECT I 124, spell 146, n. 16) = “un instrument de torture (?)” (AL 78.1680) = “ein Folterinstrument (*Schlachtblock)” (GHWb 329) = “Hackklotz” (Snk. 1999, 88 & fn. 11 with CT exx.) = “slaughtering-block” (DCT 163, 193).
nb1: R. van der Molen (DCT) assumes a reading without -«-: m3 (sic) (CT II 205a)
suggesting even a fem. form m3.t (CT IV 19d), which, however, is rather to be read
nm.t “execution-blocks” (AECT I 208).
nb2: The reading of its "nal consonant is uncertain, several works give m«f “Block
zur Köpfung” (CT, Wb II 47, 4) = m«f “Richtblock” (Vcl. 1933, 173, #2) = m«f
“headsman’s block (FD 105) = m«f “Hinrichtungsblock (zum Köpfen)” (GHWb
327). The Berlin Wörterbuch project has both readings (Hafemann, p.c. on 19 May
2000). Similarly, R. Hannig (GHWb) listed both m«f and m«3.
! Origin debated: " 1. W. Vycichl (1933, 173, #2) read its Wb ex. equally as m«f consid
ering it as nomen loci from an unattested Eg. *«f “head” (*“Ort, an
den der Deliquent seinen Kopf hinlegt”), which he identi"ed with
188 m«!



Brb. *5-3ef “head” [ Vcl.]. The comparison of Eg. « vs. Brb. *3 is
problematic.

Mlt. 1991, 264, #40.1).
nb2: For semantical reasons, it is equally dubious whether the Brb. word is cognate
with AA *=-P “back of the head” [GT ] = *=apay- “occiput” [ Mlt.] as often proposed
in the lit., cf. Sem. *=apy- “occiput, back of the head” [SED]: BAram. qarqapt3

[Bnd. 1983, 270, #38]. Some authors compared also IE *kap-ut- “Kopf ” [ IEW
529–530]. A.Ju. Militarev (l.c.) presumed a semantic development in “back of the
head” " “back” vs. “head” " “forehead” (Gurage, Harari). Lit.: Rsl. 1952, 139

HSED #1548 (Brb.-ECh.-Sem.); Mlt. 1999, 6, #165 (Sem.-Brb.-ECh.-PIE).
nb3: There exist some untenable views on the af"liation of the Brb. root and its
AA etymon. (1) E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 98) reconstructed PBrb. *e-3rif (sic, with *-r-)
“head” ~ Eg. 0rp “leiten”. (2) C. T. Hodge (1978, 3, #67): Hgr. e-3äf “head” and
PIE *kap-ut- ~ PCh. *ka “head” (!) and Sem. *kapp- “dish, head” (sic). (3) V. É.
Orel (1995, 105, #82): Brb. “head” ~ Sem. *qab- (sic) [Orel] > Hbr. qab “a measure
of capacity (acc. to the Talmud, approximately two litres)” [KB 1060] and Eg. qbj
“Krug” (MK, Wb IV 25). (4) C. Peust (2006) reinterpreted the phon. value of the
hrgl. tp “head” (D1) as 3p in which he saw a regular re#ex of Brb. *3-f < AA *=-p
in the frames of the Rössler theory.
" 2. GT: the rendering “slaughtering-block” suggests a nomen loci of a hypothetic unattested OEg. *«3 “to slaughter” present in «3
“zerstückeln (Feinde)” (GR, Wb I 238, 21), «3.t “Gemetzel” (MK,
Wb I 239, 1) = “slaughter, massacre” (FD 51), whose etymology is disputed. Already W. Schenkel (1999, 88) supposed in m«3 a pre"x
m- (but leaving the simplex unidenti"ed).
nb: (1) Most probably a secondary sense deriving from Eg. «3 “(zer)hacken” (OK,
Wb I 238) = “to hack up, to destroy” (FD 51). For the AA etymology of this root
see EDE I 96. (2) C. T. Hodge (1966, 44; 1968, 27): MEg. «3.t equated with Ar.
3u**-at- “lessening, shortcoming” [ Hodge] !!! WCh.: Hausa gácá ~ gààcáá “to bite
off ”, gúcúré ~ gúcùráá “to break piece off ” [Abr. 1962, 311, 347]. Later, Hodge
(1969, 110, #24) compared MEg. «3.t with Ar. 3** ~ 3y* “to diminish”, 3yK “to
m«! 189



distress, enrage”, «aK3- “harm”, «KK “to fell to the ground”, and even «** “to bite,
torment” [ Hodge] and WCh.: Hausa gáú*á ~ gáú*à “to give a severe blow” [Abr.
1962, 311]. (3) A. B. Dolgopolsky (1989, 96, #44) equated it with Sem. *«¢w “to
cut asunder, divide” [ Dlg.] and SCu. *ha*- “to be separated, divided up”. (4) Th.
Schneider (1997, 197, #24) linked it to Ar. zqq “to skin, #ay, schinden”. Unaccept
able, since Eg. « + Sem. *z (see EDE I 357–361). (5) GT: perhaps MEg. «3 < *«n3
[from *«lg]? Cf. ES: Geez «allaga “to castrate, defeat, vanquish”, Tigre «alläga “to
kill in close combat” (ES: Lsl. 1987, 60).
" 3. GT: or perhaps m«3 < *m«g ~ AA *m-g-(«) “head” [GT ] (dis
cussed s.v. Eg. m33 “Haube”, NK, GHWb, infra)? " 4. L. Reinisch (1887, 263) compared a certain Eg. m«3 (sic) with
Sem. *m%) “to hit”, Bed. må3d “auf den Kopf schlagen, den Kopf blutig schlagen jmdm.”, etc., which is a baseless confusion of diverse roots.
m«d.t “corn-measure” (CT V 185ad: B7C, omitted in B9C and B10C,

nb: Perhaps occurs already in the OK: following D. Mueller (1972, 301–2),
P. Posener-Kriéger (1976, 325) resolved the logographic phon. value of the hrgl.
U9 (EG 1927, 502: “corn-measure with grain pouring out”) in the Abusir papyrus
as m«3.t (cf. AL 77.1674).
! Presumably from the same root: NK m«33 (or m33) “Art Maß für

have been of standard size), a mass of dates pressed and preserved in baskets (a container of wicker-work) used as measure” (Grd. 1940, 157–8) = “baskets of date-cake (?)” (AEO I 66*, #151 & II 286 index) = “Ziegel für getrocknete bzw. gepreßte Datteln (wie sie auch jetzt in den Handel kommen)” (Helck, MWNR 760) = “the block into which dates were pressed” ( Janssen 1975, 474) = “Dattelzubereitung” (KHW 113, fn. 4) = “measure: basket” (DLE I 258) = “*Ziegel (für Feigen)” (GHWb 329) = “mesure, récipient servant de mesure de capacité, à l’origine une façon de présenter des dattes réduites en pâte et pressées” (Meeks 1997, 43–44, §239 after Helck MWNR V 760–1; Cauville, RdE 32, 1980, 47–64; Smith, Enchoria 15, 1987, 83) > Dem. m33.t “measure of capacity” (Parker, JEA 26, 1940, 99) = m33.t “Art Maß” (DG 194) = m33 “ein Raummaß” (Lüddeckens 1960, 187, n. 39 & 363) > Cpt. (S) maaje, maje, maatse, mati (f ) “en Maß für Korn und anderes” (Lange 1925, 78) = “a measure
190 m«!.t



of grain, fruit etc. (its capacity: 12 to the rtob)” (CD 213a) = “a capacity measure of one-twelfth of an artabe that was used for grain, fruit, etc.” (Grd. 1940, 157–8; AEO II 225*, #505: especially for dates) = “ein Maß (für Früchte und Getreide)” (KHW 113, 523) = “nom d’unemesure (fruits, blé)” (DELC 132). The Dem. word passed into Gk. as 25%&9" “mesure de capacité” (Fournet 1989, 70, §10 & fn. 49 with occurences).
nb1: The continuity between CT m«3.t vs. the NK-Cpt. word was proposed
D. Mueller (1972, 301–2): “despite the different spelling and gender, CT m«3.t is in
all likelihood the MEg. form of this NK/LEg. word”, whose idea was followed by
W. Westendorf (KHW 523; 1989, 47 “gewiß identisch”), D. Meeks (AL 77.1674),
P. Wilson (PL 417). But W. Helck (LÄ III 1204, 1210) carefully avoided to mention
this equation.
nb2: The Ramesside word has also a pre-Amarna record: jm(«)33 (Urk. IV 1992:3),
cf. Meeks 1997, 44.
nb3: A. H. Gardiner (1940, 157; AEO I 66* & II 286 index), followed by West
endorf (KHW 113, fn. 4), Schenkel (1978, 31, fn. 116), R. Hannig (GHWb 329),
D. Meeks (1997, 43–44), "rmly sided with a full reading of the NK lexeme with
-«- as m«33 (partly because of Cpt. -aa- re#ecting -«-) against m33 (suggested by
Wb; Janssen 1975, 474; Helck in MWNR 760 & LÄ III 1204; Vycichl in DELC
132; Westendorf 1989, 47). Strangely, Westendorf even tried to project the reading
m33.t to CT m«3.t. L.H. Lesko’s (DLE I 258) m3.t (sic) is clearly false. Or, should
we assume a LEg. GW for *m«3 as masc. counterpart to CT m«3.t (GT)?
nb4: A. H. Gardiner (1940, 157) and E. Lüddeckens (1960, 187, n. 39) assumed a
"gurative sense of the same word in m«33 “gain, pro"t” (Adoption Pap., rt. 5–6,
time of Ramses XI, Grd. 1940, 158) = “Pro"t, Nutzen, Gewinn” (Lüddeckens
1960, 187, n. 39) = “Zugewinn in Ehe” (GHWb 329) = “produit, pro"t, revenu”
(Meeks 1997, 43–44, §239 with further lit. on this lexeme) re#ected also in Saite
m«33 (-«- in GW!) “pro"t” (2x, Grd.). Gardiner surmised a metaphor “basket for
dates” > “pro"t” like “fruit of labour” ($)(/'7, fructus) since “dates were valuable
annual produce of Eg. agriculture”. In Gardiner’s (1940, 157, fn. 15) view, this word was
“obviously related” with m3« (2x) “vom Ackerbau als Dienstp#icht” (Wb II 189, 3:
XXII.) = “to grow, cultivate” (Hoch 1994, 178, #240: XIX.), which J. Hoch (1994,
177–8, #239) was inclined to treat it separately from the m33-measure for dates
(Pap. Harris I 37a:5) as a variation of m3« (GW) “produce, crops” (XX., Pap. BM
10052, 10:15), which, besides, he explained as a borrowing from NWSem. *)m%
(or *)m0) “to grow”. Denying this, D. Meeks (1997, 43–44, §239) "rmly maintained
Gardiner’s position.
nb5: W. Spiegelberg (KHW 71) read the Dem. word (in Dem. Pap. Heidelberg
738) m«3.t (sic).
nb6: P. Wilson’s (PL 417) rendering “a capacity measure of half an artaba . . .” (sic)
for Cpt. is erroneous.
nb7: As pointed out by A. H. Gardiner (1940, 157–8), the NK term is identical
with m«33 n bnj in GR offering rituals: “m. von Datteln (eine Opfergabe)” (Wb II
186, 16–17) = “an offering in the shape of a shrine surmounted by a pyramidion”
(Grd.) = “the exact amount required for the dates (connected with the ability to
give life and rejuvenate the body)” (PL 417; cf. also Cauville 1980).
nb8: Several works (Wb, Helck in LÄ III 1204 & MWNR 760, GHWb, DELC 132)
suggest a connection of NK-GR m33 or m«33 with n33 “ein Maß für Kuchen und
Datteln” (NK, Wb II 377, 9–10) = “Ziegel für getrocknete bzw. gepreßte Datteln”
(MWNR 760) = “measure for loaves and dates” (XVIII., FD 144) = “Datteln in
Ziegeln gepreßt” (Guglielmi, LÄ III 684) = “Ziegel, Maß für Datteln, Natron, Salz,
m«!.t 191



3%” (Helck, LÄ III 1204) = “Ziegel (ein Maß)” (GHWb 448) as an earlier variation
of Ramesside m33. In the view of A. H. Gardiner (1940, 158, fn. 1), however, the
m«33-basket can have nothing in common with n33 (with the brick-like det. sug
gesting “sweetmeats” made of ground-up dates).
! Etymology debated: " 1. D. Mueller (1972, 301–2), followed by W. Westendorf (1989, 47), found it tempting to take CT m«3.t as nomen instr. from Eg. 33 “mit
Korn versorgen o.ä.” (XI., Wb V 516, 1) = “to provide (with food)” (FD 318: cf. JEA 16, 1930, 196, n. 6) connected with measuring, but since its obj. was not the grain, Mueller (pace FD) was disposed to treat it as metaphorical use of 33j “to extend”, and remained sceptical: “for the same reason, the suggested etymology of m(«)+.t remains exceedingly
doubtful ”. Declined by P. Wilson (PL 417): “origin not clear”. " 2. GT: lit. perhaps “block (as unit of measurement)” (as ingeniously suggested already by Janssen 1975, 474 for NK m«33: “the block
into which dates were pressed”) and thus eventually related with CT m«3 apparently carrying the same basic sense: “Block zur Köpfung”
(Wb) = “Richtblock” (Vcl.) = “headsman’s block (FD) = “Hinrichtungsblock (zum Köpfen)” (GHWb) = “slaughtering-block” (DCT 163, 193)? " 3. GT: or any connection with Eg. m«3.t “*Köcher” (1st IMP, WD
I 85; GHWb 329; cf. JEA 61, 1975, 50) = “*Lanzen- oder Pfeilenköcher” (ÄWb I 518a) from a common basic sense “container”?
*mw.t “1. Geier, nur aus der Schrift zu belegen”, hence: “2. die Geiergöttin D9#E von Theben” (Wb II 53, 15–16) = “divinité vautour (Gypsfulvus)” to be distinguished from *3 “Neophron percnopterus” (Keimer 1935, 186, fn. 4).
nb1: P. Lacau’s (1954, 110) rdg. m3w.t (sic) for “la déesse Maout” is false.
nb2: Survives also in (S) petemout “a village near Thebes”, now El-Me/id3m$d

nb2: There is hardly any connection between Eg. *mw.t and Bed. bit “vulture, Geier”
[ Rn. 1895, 53] as proposed by E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 168). Eg. m- + Bed. b-, and
Bed. -t is part of the root, while the "nal -t in Eg. *mw.t is the fem. marker.

nb1: After W. Spiegelberg (1917, 104, §7; 1928), an unde"ned 2nd weak consonant
has been reconstructed in its root on the basis of the Cpt. evidence (S -aa-, LF
-ee-): *mjw.t (Spg.) = *m’w.t (Zeidler 1992, 197, fn. 33: m"w.t), vocalized *må"w.et
(Spg.) = *mí"w.at (Vrg. 1973 Ib, 45) = *m°"w.'t (NBÄ 427) = *mñ’w.'t (Edel 1980,
18) = *ma3wi(y).at (Vycichl). Spiegelberg (1917, 105) quoted for the rdg. mjw.t
MK and Amarna exx. of the word written as mj.t. But P. Lacau’s (1954, 110)
and W. Westendorf ’s (KHW 106) rdg. m3w.t (sic) is far-fetched at the moment.
W. Vycichl (DELC 126; 1990, 197, §11) assumed a tricons. root *)m-w-y: *mawwi(y).t,
whence the cluster *-3w- arose secondarily from *-ww-. Its st.pron. *mw1te=f is
preserved in P)2BQR&7 < DN k3-mw.t=f “taureau de sa mère” (Vcl.).
nb2: Eg. mw.t n.t gjw “sicherlich etwas mütterliches, hervorbringendes: evt. eine

on the alleged analogy of the IE nomina actoris *m3-tér- “Mutter” [ IEW 700], i.e., Eg.

supposes a genetic connection between the AA word for “mother” and *m (2nd
pers. sg. fem. pron., on which most recently cf. Gensler 1999 MS), present e.g. in

Dolgopolsky (1988, 215, #11) compared the Sem. word for “mother” with Eg. jm3.t
“female of an animal”, which is mistaken.
nb4: N. Skinner (1995, 33) erroneously af"liated Eg. mw.t with a number of unre
lated terms derived from an AA *m-n “person” (!), e.g. Sem. *mann- “who?”, Ar.
mar"- “human being”, Eg. mn “so-and-so” (q.v.), PCu. *m-n “person, man” vs.

nb1: Frozen (fossilized) pl. tante (i.e. m.w < act. *mj.w?), where -w was not part of
the original root (as correctly suggested by A. Erman apud Nöldeke 1910, 166–9 and
by W. Spiegelberg 1917, 104, fn. 3). The external parallels (derivable only from AA
*ma"-) indicate that the actual Eg. root might have been either *)m or *)mj, which is
corroborated by the supposed phon. value mjw of the hrgl. “three ripples” (N35a) in
MK nmjw “dwarf ” (Gunn 1920–21, 102, fn. 2). The Eg. primary noun can hardly be
derived from a root *)mwj as suggested by P. Lacau (1972, 300, §11) and W. Vycichl
(1991, 120). J. ,erný (CED 95) left the question of *)mjw or *)mwj undecided.
nb2: Vocalized *måw (NBÄ) = *maw (Lpr. 1995, 44).
nb3: K. Sethe (1912, 92) assumed the hrgl. “ripple” (N35) to have signi"ed both n
vs. m in the early times. Similarly, following Sethe, P. Lacau (1913, 64) attributed
an early rdg. mw (!) to N35 whose pl. was in fact the word written with the “three
ripples”. G. R. Driver derived the Phn. letter m1m from the Eg. hrgl. “ripple” (N35,
cf. n.t “water”), which, however, Cassirer (1949, 113) disposed to explain rather from
the GW phon. value m of “three ripples”.
nb4: To mw “water” in Ptahhotep 458 and Admonitions 3:13, Z. Bába (1956, 156)
attributes a metaphoric sense “nécessité (?), bésoin impératif, pressant (?)”, water
being an indispensable thing in Egypt.

! Hence: (1) mwj “1. der Harn, 2. das Harnen” (Lit. MK, Wb II 53, 2–3). (2) mwj.t “Harn” (Med., Wb II 52, 7–9) = “urine” (FD 105) " Cpt. (SBF) mh, (SB) mi, (F) memhA(f ) “urine” (CD 158a) = “Harn, Ausscheidung” (KHW 86) = “excrément” (Dévaud) > Pi-Solsel m5 “Harn” (Vcl. 1936, 172).
nb1: E. Dévaud (1921, 166–8) explained the Cpt. word from a certain MK mrj
~ mj “excrément” (orig. *mr, voc. *m°r > *m°ô), which is not accepted in the
standard lexicons.
nb2: The etymological position of the LP hapax mwj “Same (bildlich für Sohn)”

nb1: The second root consonant in PSem. may be either *-" or *-y. The recon
struction of PSem. word (above) is disputed. In any case, J. Osing’s (NBÄ 704,
n. 808) PSem. *maw (sic) is baseless. Considering Ar. m3"- to be “of course secondary”,
L. Kogan (2000, 723–4) thinks that J. Tropper’s (2000, 164) reconstruction of *-"- in
the PSem. stem “is against the evidence” presented in Lsl. 1987, 376 and KB 576–7,
although he too admits that “some AA cognates” (EDE I 120) have -"-.
nb2: Ch. Ehret (1995, 507, #604) derived a number of unrelated Ar. roots from the
bicons. PSem. *m"- “to be wet, produce #uid”: m"d “to become juicy and begin to
grow”, m"r “to break open again (wound)”, m"š “to wash the ground”. Similarly,
H. Möller (1911, 168–9) identi"ed Sem. *m- (sic) “water” with the hypothetic bicon
sonantal *mw- falsely deduced from Ar. mwh “aquam multam habuit (putens)”, mw2
“to moisten (a thing) in water”, mawC- “unda”.
nb3: The etymological analysis of common Brb. *aman “water” [ Mkr.] is highly
disputed:
(1) Most widespread is the theory that PBrb. *aman derives from a monoradical root
*m (as usually stated also in the Brb. lexicons), i.e. *aman was a fossilized masc. pl.
form: *a-m-an (Bates: coll. < *m3), identical with the Eg.-Sem. root (Bst. 1883, 336;
Brk. 1908, 332; Prv. 1911, 112; Möller 1911, 155; Bates 1914, 82; Möller 1924, 42;

Mkr. 1969, 34; Osing 1976, 704, fn. 808; Behrens 1981, 24–25; Djk. etc. 1986,
64; Hodge 1988, 273; Sasse 1991, 271, #1.2; Djk. 1992, 33; HSED #1699; Stl.
1997, 81, #1.1). This Eg.-Brb. comparison was "rmly rejected by W. Vycichl (DELC
126–127). Following E. Laoust, J. Bynon (1984, 278–9, #42) did not exclude even
a borrowing of the Brb. word from Punic (?). Improbable.
(2) G. Möller (1921, 193–5), P.-H. Zunke (1923/1997, 39), W. Vycichl (1933, 177;
1934, 46), and W. Helck (in Haussig ed. 1965, 331), in turn, combined PBrb. *aman
“water” with a hypothetic LEg. *jmn “Meer (?), Teich (?)” (Möller) = *aman (sic!)
“Wasser” (Vcl.) deduced from the phon. value late hrgl. used (from XXII.) for
writing Eg. jmn “Amon” (Wb I 84, 17). This would, however, imply that the Brb.
word should be analyzed as *a-man (i.e., with -n as part of the root), which J. Osing
(NBÄ 704, n. 808) already rightly rejected (although his reconstructions are gravely
mistaken: Brb. *m3, Sem. *maw, sic!). Möller thinks to have found the same Brb.
word also in LEg. «mn (GW) attested as the hieratic gloss for Dem. brg.t “Teich”
in the bilingual (hieratic LEg. vs. Dem.) “bigger” Theban Pap. Rhind rt. 6:7. The
hrgl. jmn, however, can be better explained on Eg. grounds, namely from *jw-m-nw
“Insel mit Wasser” as suggested by K. Sethe (Vcl. 1934, 46, fn. 1).
(3) With special regard to the Guanche data (from *a-hem-on [GT ] = *a-hamV-n
[ Mlt.]), other scholars (e.g. Wlf. 1955, 87, #22; 1965, 513, #232; Vcl. 1955, 314;
1960, 263; 1983, 126–127; Dlg. 1964, 62; Prs. 1974, 146, 410; Rsl. 1979, 22–23;

Skn. 1995, 34; Takács 1996, 49, #19; Blz. 2000, 38, #19; PAM 2003, 518) prefer
mw 199



to analyze PBrb. *aman “water” as *a-am-an [ Wlf.] = *i-im1-in [ Vcl. 1955] =
*i-ymiyu-n " *1m1n " *aman [ DELC] = *ham3h-an [Prs.] = *am-an [Skn.]
= *Ham-Vn [ Mlt. 1984] = *ama-n [ Mlt. 1991] = *hdm3h-dn [PAM], i.e. as the
pl. of a hypothetic stem *-am-, which was reconstructed various ways by various
authors: e.g. PBrb. *yemi [ Vcl. 1960], = *y-m [ Rsl. 1979] = *em ~ *am [ Wlf.].
The supporters of this etymology identi"ed PBrb. *aman with Sem. *yamm- “sea”
[ Djk. 1965, 42] !!! Bed. yam (pl. tante) “water” [ Vcl.] !!! CCh. *y-m “water” [GT ].
G. Takács (1996, 49, #19) demonstrated that Brb. *a-ham-an may be akin to Ar.
hmw ~ hmy “couler (une larme qui s’échappe de l’oeil)” [BK II 1450] !!! Ch. *am
[ Nwm.] = *ham- “water” [GT ] !!! Eg. hmh “Speichel” (NK, Wb II 490, 8).
(4) E. Zyhlarz (1950, 436) explained Guanche: Ferro ahemon as a borrowing from
Canaanite: Pun. "gmn “Wassertümpel” < "gm “Sumpf ” suspecting a “Mißverständnis
bei der Aufnahme des Vokabels für ‘Wasser’, wahrscheinlich unter Hinweis auf eine Tümpel ”.
False.
nb4: The Brb. word passed into Nubian, cf. ONub. & Mahasi aman “water” (Zhl.
1934–35, 185; Wlf. 1955, 87, #22; Behrens 1981, 24–25), but the time of bor
rowing is debated: P. Behrens (1981, 37) suggested a Nubian wandering during
the NK into their present area ousting a Berber population, while I. Hofmann
(1983, 39, 41) preferred a late date (2nd half of the 10th cent. AD) when a sudden
Berber migration occured eastwards under the Fatimides (for further discussion cf.
Bechhaus-Gerst 1996, 145f.). A. Zaborski (1989, 176, n. 1), in turn, has rejected

*mhw, cf. Ar. mahuwa “être clair et aqueux” [BK II 1164] = “to be liquid, waterish”
[Zbr. 1971, #139] !! ES *mhw “to (be) melt(ed)” [Lsl.], which, however, represent
a distinct AA root (probably *m-h-w), cf. Eg. mhwj “etwas Flüßiges” (Med., Wb
II 114, 1–3) !!! LECu.: perhaps Som. m3h- [or secondary -h-?] “1. hervorquellen,
#ießen, 2. frisches, #ießendes Wasser” [ Rn. 1902, 289] = “eau courante, faire couler

WCh.: Angas-Sura *mwa2 (orig. *mw32?) “1. (milky) sap, juice, 2. tear” [GT 2004,
256] may also belong here. Note that W. G. E. Watson (2002, 798, §6) derived
Ug. mhy-t (3x) “rain” from Ug. my “water” (contra Badre et al., Syria 53, 1976,
121–2 who saw in the former a part. < )hyh expressing “l’idée de la chute de la
neige . . . ou de la pluie . . . ‘averse’ ”).
nb6: M. Lamberti (1993, 362), in turn, equated Bed. m$" with HECu.: Kmb. &
Alb. mu9-a “naß” derived from his OCu.-Om. *may*y- “to wash”.
nb7: It is not yet clear whether AA *m-" “water” [GT ] has anything to do with
either of the following Ch. roots: (1) WCh.: Hausa mííyà “soup or gravy (made from
meat and leaves etc.)” [Abr. 1962, 676–7]; (2) Ch. *m-y “saliva” [GT ] (discussed
in the entry for Eg. m««, q.v.); (3) WCh.: Tsagu mo"oyi “dew” [Skn.] !! CCh.: Ktk.:

common AA *m-" “water” [GT ] vs. AA *y-m “water” [GT ] vs. AA *h-m “water”
[GT ]. O.V. Stolbova (1997, 81–82, #1.2) supposes in PCh. *"amma “water” [Stl.]
an assim. of *"amwa, which she considered an old broken pl. of AA *ma"/y/w
“water” [Stl.] following the pattern *"apr3s- just like Ar. "amw3h- or WCh.: Bok
kos re, pl. "arya “man” (which is the only known Chadic example of this type of
broken pl. acc. to Stolbova). H. Jungraithmayr and D. Ibriszimow (1994 I 176), in
turn, explained almost all Ch. forms from their PCh. *y-m-n “water”. This great

nb: The old renderings of mw.w (A. Moret 1927, 258: “rois bouffons”; G. van der Leeuw
quoted by Brunner-Traut: “bekrönte Narren”; Jéquier 1925–7, 144–151: “Wasser
geister”) were rejected by E. Brunner-Traut (1992, 57–59), who saw in the mw.w “die
Vertreter einer Nekropolengottheit, die dem Jenseits entstiegen, um (den Toten) in
ihre Welt zu holen”. H. Junker (MDAIK 9, 1940, 1f., 26, 28), in turn, identi"ed them
with “die Seelen von Buto als die verstorbenen Könige von Buto, Seelen der Könige,
die aus ihren Gräbern dem Trauerzug entgegeneilen”. Emphasizing the parallel
ism of CT I 281c (“Es schütteln für dich die beiden Herrinnen von Buto/Dpw ihre Locken”)
vs. the Eg. burial ritual (cf. Junker, MDAIK 9, 1940, 8f., 24, 26; Fakhry, ASAE 42,
1943, t. 52 etc., where “ähnlich schütteln die Mww bzw. die Seelen von Buto . . . vor dem Toten
ihr vorüberfallendes Haar”), P. Kaplony (KBIÄF 181, n. 261 & 186, n. 272), in turn,
202 mw.w



surmised in mw.w “die unterägyptische Ahnenkönige oder die Urgötter der Flut . . . als Trauergefolge
des Toten (Osiris)”. After a thorough discussion of the mw.w, H. Altenmüller (1975,
2–36) suggests (o.c., pp. 36–37) that “die Tracht der Muu deutet ihre Funktion als Fährleute
und Grenzwächter an. Wie die Bewohner der Sump"andschaften sind sie mit den Kränzen aus
Papyrusstauden geschmückt”. The mw.w “. . . als Fährleute haben die Aufgabe, den Transport der
Mumie einzuleiten und dessen Durchführung zu überwachen. Sie werden als Grenzwächter an den
Gewässern des Osthimmels mythologisiert und sind zugleich die Fährleute, die für die Überfahrt des
Toten zum Osthorizont . . . sorgen”. They are – in Altenmüller’s formulation – “Wesen, die
einst selbst sterblich waren, aber durch ihren Tod in den Stand von ‘Geistern’ (30w) ja von ‘Göttern’
(ntrw) erhoben worden sind ”. So also H. Altenmüller (LÄ IV 271–2): “. . . wahrscheinlich,
daß aufgrund ihrer Tracht in den Muu Fährleute oder Grenzwächter zu erkennen sind. Sie sollten
im Ritual die Rolle der . . . mythischen Fährleute übernehmen, die . . . für den Himmelsaufstieg des
Toten sorgten”. In the view of D. Meeks (2001, 357–8) too, their dance was performed
when the procession reached the tomb differed in the “less sophisticated scenes”
from the that of others only by their special head-dress (woven of papyrus-stalks)
is identifying them as marsh dwellers, more precisely, as ferry-men, their role being
to ferry the dead across the waters leading to the netherworld.
! Etymology obscure. " 1. G. Jéquier (1925–27, 147–8) explained it from Eg. mw “water”, lit. “celui des eaux . . ., créatures . . . que les Égyptiens se "guraient résider au sein du grand abîme”. Similarly, P. Kaplony (KBIÄF 181, n. 261) considered mw(.j).w as an old nisbe, lit. “Wasserleute”, hence: “unterägyptische Ahnenkönige“. This etymology was adopted also by H. Altenmüller (1975, 36–37), even if with hesitation (“von unklarer Etymologie”) and from a different standpoint: he maintains that mw.w literally meant “die zum Wasser gehörenden Männer”, which “möglicherweise hängt mit den Wasserwegen zusammen, an deren Ufer die ‘Muu’ Dienst tun (mit der ursprünglichen Aufgabe, als Fährleute, . . . die für die Überfahrt des Toten . . . sorgen)”.
nb: Jéquier falsely included in this equation also nmjw “dwarf ” (MK) misread by
him as mw (sic).

nb: For the late wtg. mnf cf. RdE 9, 1952, 15, n. 4; WD II 60. The omission of
-n- (mwf ) in Pap. Anastasi I 5:6 may be due to m- (Fischer-Elfert 1986, 54). Its
wtg. mnf3 in Pap. Anastasi I 9:1 looks like a reinterpretation *m-nf3 “durch (o.ä.)

! Etymology still obscure. " 1. Already H. Grapow (1914, 24) surmised in it the participial m- pre"x, but he did not explain the meaning of *wnf. W. Vycichl (1934, 102; 1959, 37) and H. Smith (1979, 161), in turn, suggested a nomen agentis m- form derived from Eg. wnf “sich freuen” (MK, Wb I 319) = “to be joyful” (FD 61). A direct derivation from this Eg. root is semantically baseless, albeit a remote connection is not fully unjusti"ed. " 2. GT: Eg. mwnf denoting a con"dential status, the underlying root (*wnf < *wlf ?) is perhaps related to Sem. *wlp “to be intimate, friendly” [GT ]: JAram. ylp “1. gewohnt sein, sich gewöhnen, p#egen, 2. lernen” [Levy 1924 II, 242–3], Mnd. ylp ~ "lp ~ «lp peal “to

(from Ar.?): Qbl. wellef “1. durer, rester (par accoutumence), 2. s’habituer”, walef “être habitué, accutumé” [ Dlt. 1982, 864].
nb1: A. Zaborski (l.c.) set up a biconsonantal Sem. *lp “to get accustomed”, cf. Ar.
lwf: l3fa “to join friendship with” [Zbr.], Ar. "alifa “1. s’habituer (à un lieu, une
demeure), 2. devenir doux, apprivoisé” [BK I 46] = “vertraut sein, sich dauernd
aufhalten” [GB], Hbr. "lp qal “etwa: vertraut werden” [GB 44] = “to learn (accustom
o’self to)” [KB 59]. GB l.c., however, suggests a connection with Sem. *"lp “sich
verbinden” (a Volksetymologie?).
nb2: Eventually, a remote etymological connection of Sem. *wlp “to be friendly”
vs. Eg. wnf “sich freuen” is not excluded, although the -n- of Cpt. (SB) ounoF
“to rejoice” (CD 485) seems to speak against this connection (but cf. Takács 2005,
77–82), cf., e.g., IE *pr3i- “gern haben” > i.a. OIndic pr5Nãti “erfreut”, med. “ist
vergnügt über etwas”, pr5yate “liebt”, pr5tí- (f ) “Freude, Befriedigung”, Germanic
*frij-.- “freundlich behandeln, umwerben”, hence *frij-ond- (part.) “Freund, Ver
wandter”: Gothic frij.nds “friend” etc. (IEW 844; Kluge 1999, 285–6). Note that
E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 89, §10; 1934, 117) and V. Bla&ek (1992, 141, §11) equated
Eg. wnf with SBrb. *w-n-f: Hgr. unnaf “etwas gern haben, vorziehen”, wenif-et
“etwas zu sehen wünschen” [Zhl.].
! Other etymologies cannot be accepted: " 3. C. Ceugney (1880, 6) derived its late var. mwf (sic) via pre"x mfrom Eg. w«f “dompter, châtier” (Ceugney) = “gekrümmt, eingebogen
sein, niederbeugen” (MK, Wb I 285) = “to bend down, subdue, be bent, curled up” (FD 57).
nb: To be declined both semantically and phonologically (MEg. mwnf can hardly
derive from MEg. w«f ).
" 4. L. Homburger (1930, 284) equated it with Ful ballowo, pl. walluHe “a help”. Baseless. " 5. H. Goedicke (1977, 155, n. 190) supposed a “probable” connection to Eg. mnf3.t “Art Soldaten” (MK, Wb, q.v.), which can be safely excluded, the underlying roots (*wnf vs. *nf3) being clearly distinct.
mf% j “Getreide sieben” (OK, Wb II 55, 13) = “to pass (grain) through sieve” (Grd. 1909, 115) = “setacciare (- nqr)” (Curto 1959, 238, fn. 1) = “tamiser (du grain)” (AL 77. 1683, 78.1689) = “passare i cereali al vaglio” (Conti 1978, 158) = “(durch)sieben (Getreide)” (GHWb 332; ÄWb I 526) = “sieben” (Altenmüller 1998, 122, 281).
nb: Regarding its fem. inf. mf0.t, most probably IVae inf. mf0j, which is con"rmed
also by its supposed denom. origin (suggested already by P. J. Watson 1979, 106,
n. 25).
206 mf#j



! Already W. Czermak (1931, 28, fn. 1) correctly surmised the m- pre"x in Eg. mf0 on the basis of the incompatibility laws: “altes m- Prä!x, sonst m + f unmöglich im unzertrennlichen Wortstamme”. The identi"cation of the underlying root is, however, debated: " 1. P. J. Watson (1979, 106, n. 25), Ch. Reintges (1994, 226), and P. Wilson (PL 420) tried to explain it as an m- pre"x form of Eg. f0 “(ab)lösen” (OK, Wb I 578) with diverse semantical derivations.
nb: Watson rendered the unattested *mf0 “looser”, while Reintges used an erroneous
rendering “to sift” for Eg. f0. Wilson, in turn, saw a remote connection to Eg. mf0
“sledge” derived by P. Kaplony (KBIÄF 157. n. 197) equally from Eg. f0 (assuming
a lit. sense “der entfernbare Untersatz”).
" 2. G. Conti (1978, 93–94, 97, 147, 158), followed by W. G. E. Watson (2000, 570, §22), af"liated it with Sem. *np0 “souf#er (avec la bouche)” [Cohen] = “sof"are” [Conti] = “to blow” [GT ], which would imply either a pre"x *n- in Sem. or assuming an assim. of Eg. mf0 from *nf0, which can hardly be correct, since Eg. n + f were not incompatible. Semantically also rather improbable.

nb2: The etymological analysis of Sem. *np0 is somewhat uncertain. W. von Soden
(1968, 176) assumed (probably correctly) a pre"xation by n-: “pu%/0 machen”.
G. Conti (1978, 95–97), in turn, supposed a bicons. *np-, whence he derived a
number of semantically unconvincing comparanda: Sem. *npd “to penetrate, sepa
rate” (sic), *np¿ “to shake, sieve”, *npg “to smell”, *npy ~ *npp “to sieve”, *npš “to
breathe” !!! Eg. mf0, nf3, fn3, nf, nfj.t. Most of these roots are unrelated. Cf. also
(via met.) AA *n-#-f [GT ] > Ar. na0afa “1. faire sortir l’air par le nez, comme si

[BK II 1222] !!! NBrb.: Mzg. ngef > nyef “perdre halaine, être essou#é, haleter”
[ Tai" 1991, 475].
nb3: Following von Soden’s analysis, we may derive Sem. *np0 from AA *f-Q
(probably *fu1O-) “1. to blow” [GT ], cf. SCu. *fU=- [GT ] = *f.=- “1. to catch one’
breath, 2. rest” [Ehret]: Asa fu"-it- [-"- < *-=- reg.] “1. to catch one’s breath, 2. rest”

Angas f$k “bellows” [ Flk. 1915, 178] = fuk (K) “Blasebalg” [ Jng. 1962 MS] =
fuk “bellows” [ALC 1978, 18], Kfy. fuk “1. to blow, 2. operate bellows” [ Ntg. 1967,

" 3. GT: mf0j is presumably a denominal verb of an unattested *mf0 “sieve”, which must be a nomen instr. of a hypothetic Eg. *f0 (or *wf0) “to sieve”. This assumption seems to be corroborated (in spite of the anomalous initial labials) by AA *p-Q (perhaps *pu0-?) “to winnow,

nb2: Caïtucoli (l.c.) derived Masa from pùk “accoucher, mettre bas” (?)
nb3: The eventual relationship of AA *pu0- “to sieve grain, winnow” [GT ] and AA
*fu"- “to blow” [GT ] (above) is more than dubious. Although the sematic develop
ment “to sieve grain, winnow” < “to blow” would not be strange, cf. e.g. NOm.:
Haruro pumm-3ys “1. sof"are, 2. vagliare, stracciare” [CR 1937, 657], nevertheless,
Brb. *k (i.a. < AA *q) and Dhl. = (i.a. < AA *‘) clearly contradict.

(Wb I 579–580) with regard to the use of jnm “skin” of the surface of turquoise

Ember (quoted in Alb. 1918, 230, fn. 1; Clc. 1936, #409) combined Eg. mfk3.t ~ fk3.t (rendered by Müller “Malstein”) with OT Hbr. p$k “Stibium, Augenschminke” [GB 636] = “eye make-up (the composition of which is disputed: either black make-up, stibium, kohl or a red pigment, R#Q$97 obtained from lichens)” [KB 918] explained by Müller from a hypothetic *pwk “1. malen, 2. bes. (später) schminken”. False.
nb: Müller (followed by KB 918) meant an old Sem. loan-word in Eg. (!). The origin
of the Hebrew word is disputed. (1) Usually (GB 636; Albright 1918, 230, fn. 1;
KB 918), the root of Hbr. p$k is identi"ed with Syr. pkk “to crush” [KB] !! Ar. fkk
“1. dégager, défaire, briser, 2. séparer, disjoindre deux objets, 3. ouvrir, etc.” [BK
II 623] < Sem. *pkk “zerbrechen, pulverisieren” [GB] = “powder” (sic) [KB].
(2) Th. O. Lambdin (1953, 152), J. Aistleitner (1948, 7), and W. Vycichl (DELC
117), in turn, suggests a borrowing from LEg. mfk ~ fk.t (malachite having been
used in the preparation of green stibium).
" 2. Later, W. M. Müller (1899, 39–41) suggested that the Eg. term should be derived from OT nopek “ein grüner Edelstein” supposing “eine uralte Entlehnung aus dem Semitischen” (!). Similarly, W. Helck (1971, 505) treated LEg. mfk.t (!) as an “altes Fremdwort” from Hbr. nopek (!). False.
nb1: Such an early borrowing of an OK word (attested already in Dyn. III) from
an isolated Sem. word (the common Sem. nature of which is not at all clear) seems
almost an anachronism.
210 mfk3.t



nb2: Assuming an interchange of n- ~ l-, Müller (1899, 41) combined Hbr. nopek
with a certain Amarna Akk. lupakku (not listed in Ebeling 1915; AHW; CAD),
which he equally rendered as “ein grüner Edelstein” and included in his dubious
comparison of Hbr. p$k vs. Eg. mfk3.t in a rather obscure way (o.c., p. 40): “meine
Vermutung, dass es mit [hbr.] pwk zusammenhängt, lasse ich dahingestellt”.
" 3. W. F. Albright (1918, 230; quoted also by Ember 1930, 55; Clc. 1936, #409), assumed an irregular correspondence of Eg. f vs. Sem. *2 and compared Eg. mfk3.t < *fk3 < *fkl with Sem. *"i2k3l- “cluster
of grapes” [Gray] = *2kl “grape” [Shalunov]. Dif"cult to accept.
nb1: Attested in Ebl. /"i/a2k3lum/ [Krebernik 1983, 26] !! Ug. "2kl “bunch, cluster”
[ DUL 125] vs. |škl [ Virolleaud 1954–57. 22, §4], OT Hbr. "eškol (1x) ~ "ešk.l

with clusters of fruits” [Shalunov] !! Geez "ask3l, pl. "ask3l3t ~ sakwal3t “grape(s),
cluster (of grapes, dates), bunch (of fruit)” [Lsl.], sakala “to bear grapes” [Lsl.]
(Sem.: GB 71; Gray 1934, 45; Lsl. 1987, 42–43; Shalunov 1994 MS, 1, §5). In KB
l.c., a borrowing of the NWSem. exx. from Akk. (a/jB, nA) is/š0unnatu [irreg.
-s-] “Weintraube” [AHW 387] = “cluster of grapes” [CAD I 190] is pondered.
H. Bauer (ZS 10, 1935, 168) assumes the same Wanderwort to be present also in
JAram. s2g.l ~ s2g$l3 [irreg. s-] “Traube, racemus, der Kamm, woran Beeren oder
Blüten traubenförmig wachsen” [Levy 1924 III 475].
nb2: Although Eg. f normally + Sem. *2, it is not fully impossible (cf. the old com
parison of Eg. fq3 vs. Sem. *2ql).
nb3: Albright considered this Eg.-Sem. comparison to be justi"ed by the fact that
“malachite frequently occurs in botryoidal formation”. However, a different semantical jus
ti"cation would be perhaps more appropriate. Some Chadic data point to an orig.
meaning “blue” (AA *'-k-l?), from which Sem. *2kl may eventually also derive, cf.
CCh.: MM *'-k-l-t “blue” [GT ]: Muyang 'ok(e)lete, Hurzo 'ákùlét (MM: Rsg.
1978, 214, #77).
nb4: Later, Albright (1921, 83) spoke of “the identity of Assyr. sâmtu with Eg. mfk3.t”
that “may be regarded as absolutely certain” (cf. JEA 6, 1920, 90, n. 7), which can hardly
be maintained, cf. Akk. sâmtu “Röte” [AHW 1019].
" 4. GT: Eg. *fk3 < *fkl, perhaps from AA *f-k-l (with diverse vars. via met.) “a (dark) colour: blue (?)” [GT ]? Cognate with Ar. kalifa I “3. tirer sur le noir (se dit d’une couleur rouge sale)”, XI “contracter une couleur rouge foncé et sale (p.ex., d’une jarre à vin)”, kalf- “rouge sale tirant sur le noir, couleur brune”, kulf-at- “couleur rouge sale, brun” [BK II 924–5] !!! WCh.: Angas kd-fáldk “a colour name” Hausa gunya “cream-coloured” (i.e., Hs. gúnyáá “1. cream-dun horse, 3. yellow sandals, 4. saddle-cloth with yellow embroidery”, Abr. 1962, 343) [ Flk. 1915, 205] ! Pero pákálàw (adj.) “yellow, pale, blue” [ Frj. 1985, 44] = pa3alawì “yellow” [Krf. 1981, #276] !! CCh.: (?) Boka pûkin [-n < *-l?] “blue” [Krf. 1981, #277] !

nb1: Note that Eg. -f- vs. Angas -f-, Pero p- < Ch. *f- are regular.
nb2: A common origin of Eg. *fkl and Eg. 2frr [from *k#l] “to be blue” (GR, Wb
V 300, 4; GHWb 953), 2frr.t ~ tfrr.t “das Land, aus dem der Lapislasuli kommt”
(MK, Wb V 300, 1) is not excluded, cf. Takács 2005, 73 & fn. 227.
mfd “(ein Land) durchlaufen” (GR, Wb II 58, 6) = “traverser, parcourir en sautant” (Ceugney) = “durcheilen (ein Land)” (Grapow) = “to travel through” (Smith) = “to run through” (PL 421).
nb: The alternative rdg. m3fd proposed by C. Ceugney and H. Smith has no ety
mological support.
! As suggested in Wb and by C. Ceugney (1880, 7), H. Grapow (1914, 24), H. Smith (1979, 162–3) and P. Wilson (PL), it derives from Eg. jfd “1. davonrennen (wie Wild), 2. (einen Ort) durcheilen” (XVIII., Wb I 72, 1–2) = “sauter, bondir” (Ceugney) = “to #ee” (FD 17) = “to hasten through” (Smith) = “#iehen, laufen, schnell marschieren, durcheilen (Ort)” (GHWb 46).
nb: The etymology of Eg. jfd is debated. (1) Most probably, this is cognate with
Ar. "a"da “se dépêcher” [BK I 39] = “eilen” [ Vrg.] = “to hurry” [ Hodge], cf. also
Sem. *pdd “to #ee” [GT ]: Syr. pdd “evanuit, discessit, defecit de siiti” [Brk.] !! Ar.
fdd “3. courir (se dit d’un homme)”, fdfd “courir en se sauvant devant l’ennemi ou
devant une bête féroce” [BK II 554, 556] (Sem.: Dlg. 1967, 306). Lit. for Eg.-Sem.:
Ember 1930, #4.a.15; Vrg. 1945, 144, #23.a.1; Hodge 1968, 22; Blv. 1987, 279;
1991, 88, #1; 1993, 53. (2) A few authors (Hannig in GHWb l.c.; Wilson in PL
l.c.) derive it apparently from Eg. fd “4” via “#iehen wie Wild mit ‘vier’ Beinen”
(GHWb) = “to go on four legs (i.e., fast, implying speed and directness)” (PL). (3)
Th. Schneider (1997, 195, #10) compared it in the frames of the Rösslerian cons.
correspondences with Ar. "abi)a “être agile et rapide à la course” [BK I 4].

nb1: A. H. Gardiner’s (l.c.) rendering “seed-corn of emmer” (widely accepted in
the lit.) was rejected by W. Helck (MWNR 803), R. Germer (1979, 279 excluding
“Sorghum” as “nicht feststellbar”), Charpentier (1981, §506), and D. Meeks (2005, 245
equally rejecting “Durra, Sorghum”). Helck considered it “überraschend, wenn es Synonym
von bd.t wäre”, which is, however, just the case in Pap. Lansing 3:6 (Caminos LEM 382:
“synonym of bd.t with special reference to the grain itself ” disproved by Germer l.c.).

suggested by Spaull (1969, 222, §3).

! Etymology uncertain due to the disputable mng. and root (*mjmj or mm?). " 1. Following H. Brugsch (l.c.: “äth. Ursprungs”), W. R. Dawson (l.c.) identi"ed it with Gk.

Keimer (1967, 149) and R. Germer (1979, 2) " 2. E. Edel (1970, 23–24, §11), followed by P. Wilson (PL 411), compared it to a number of terms of dubious relationship: (1) late OK (Qubbet el-Hawa) mm.t “eine P#anze” (VI., GHWb 333; ÄWb I 527) = “a form of grain” (Spaull 1969, 222, §3) vs. PT 1362b mm.t (rendered in ÜKAPT “Wurfholz”!) > CT mm.t “une plante comestible” (CT VII 424d, AL 78.1695); (2) Med. mjm.t “eine of"zinell verwendete P#anze, deren Blätter Saft enthalten” (Edel, q.v.); (3) LP mm-n2r vs. mm.t-n2r “das mm(t) des Gottes in kultischer Verwendung (vgl.

simpli!ée de deux objets complètement differents, damier et palissade (a wattle and a daub fence
with ends projecting at the top)”, sometimes “un damier, dans la plupart des cases . . . une
palissade en clayonnage, une ‘sériba’ ou une barrière dont les pieux verticaux solidement enfoncés
en terre sont réunis par un travail de vannerie ou de barres”. Reaf"rmed by S. Curto (1967,
20–22, §C) who saw in the hrgl. “1. "gura di scacchiera, 2. di palizzata o di muro”
quoting evidence from a Giza mastaba where it “raf!gura chiaramente un muro con
paraste che salgono oltre il bordo superiore della parete, alternatemente più o meno alte”, while
in the temple of Darius at El-Khargeh it represents “sicuramente un muro di mattoni
coronato di una palizzata” (cf. ASAE 40, 1940, 367, n. 140). The interpretation by
Pillet was secondary and divergent from the original representation as pointed out

with Ug. mn-t “Teil, Glied, Portion” [ WUS] < Sem. *mnw ~ *mny (?) “to count”

nb2: For the semantic development in Eg. mn, cf. e.g. Eng. one “1” ~ “someone
(in general)”.
nb3: A similar (but not the same) idea was proposed by A. Dolgopolsky (2005,
25–26, #35), who explained Eg. mn, along with IE *monwo-/*menu- (?) “alone”,
eventually from Nst. *me[y]=U “oneself, one’s own, body” (see below).
" 3. A. H. Gardiner (1916, 182) derived it (along with mn.t “nature”, mn.t “wine-measure”, q.v.) from Eg. mn “to be "rm, established”. Unconvincing. " 4. J. Osing (NBÄ 604, n. 572) af"liated it with Eg. mn.t (*mñn.'t) “Art und Weise”, which is in fact certainly a distinct root. " 5. V. Bla&ek (1992, 139–140; 1999, 61, #23), in turn, identi"ed Eg. mn with the re#exes of AA *man- “man” [1992] = *manw-/*many“man” [1999] (preserved in Brb.-ECu.-NOm.-Ch.). Similarly, L. Homburger (1960–63, 56) equated Eg. mn with Sid. mann-a “men, people” [ Hds.]. Possible only if we assume an eventual cognacy of AA *m-n “who” vs. AA *m-n “man” [GT ].
nb1: For the semantic development, cf. e.g. (as typological parallel) PIE *manu
“man” " i.a. German Mann & man (IEW 700).
nb2: For a detailed discussion of the derivatives of AA *man- “man” see the entry
for Eg. mnw “Min” (below). Note that Bla&ek (1999 l.c.) mistakenly compares here
NOm.: Wlt. min-. “warrior” and Haruro (Kachama) mon-o “strong”.
" 6. A. Dolgopolsky (2005, 25–26, #35) combined it with Brb. *-m3n “soul, person” [ Dlg.] !!! HECu.: Sid. mann-imma “body” [ Hds. 1989, 29] !! SCu.: Dhl. móni “self ” [ Dlg.] = maní “re#exive” [EEN 1989, 37], whereby he explained Brb. *m- (pre"x of the reciprocal-re#.-pass. stirp) !!! Cu. *m- (pre"x of pass.-re#.) too, along with some Alt., Drv. parallels, eventually from Nst. *me[y]=U “oneself, one’s own, body” [ Dlg.]. Some of these comparanda are hardly tenable.
nb: (1) The Brb. re#exes are usually listed under the monoradical root )m (with a
fossilized pl. circum"x), which is clearly con"rmed by the AA evidence, cf. LECu.:
Das. mã “person, man” [ Tosco 2001, 516] !! SCu. *mi “people” [Ehret 1980,
160, #55] !!! NOm.: Sezo may & Hozo mo “man (vir)” [Bnd. 1990, 610, #148] !!!
WCh.: PGmy. *-may “man” [GT 2004, 243–4] ! BT *mu/*mi “person” [Schuh
1984, 211] = *m5 ~ *m$ [GT after Schuh 1978, 150] etc. (2) Sid. mann-imma
is rather cognate with Kmb. mann-.mat “body” [ Hds.], which may derive from
HECu. *man-a, pl. *mann-a “man” [ Hds. 1989, 96]. For the semantic shift cf.
HECu. *naf-a “body” [ Hds. 1989, 29] !!! WCh.: Fyer & Monguna náaf, Klr. naafú,
Mangar nàaf “man (vir)” (Ron: JI 1994 II, 230; Seibert 2000 MS, a001) !! CCh.:
Ga’anda n3f-'á “person” [ Nwm. 1977, 123]. (3) As indicated in EEN 1989, 37,
Dhl. maní has no SCu. cognates. (4) The Brb.-Cu. pass.-re#. marker *m- is of
common AA nature and has no *-n.

lit.: Ehret 1995, #588 (Eg.-Orm.-Kyr.); Bnd. 1983, 340 (Birale-Orm.).
nb1: Ch. Ehret (l.c.) analyzed Koyra mínl-e as *mil-n-, extended by a suf"x -n- (whose
function was left unexplained). Instead, a dissim. (mínl-e < *míll-e) is better to be
suspected, which is supported by the Oromo parallel.

In principle, a connection to either of these forms is not excluded (Angas bw5n and Musgu bul are distinct roots).
nb: The development of Eg. m- < PAA *mb- suggested by Greenberg is problematic,
and Cpt. b- may be an inner Eg. innovation too (due to a dissim. of nasals: OEg.

parallel in OEg. bnw “waist, buttocks” (PT, above).
" 8. P. Lacau (1970, 128, §338; 1972, 49, §15) derived Eg. mn.t from wnj “eilen” (PT, Wb I 313). Semantically very weak.

nb: The CT hapax was conceived by R. O. Faulkner (AECT II 169) as an irreg.
spelling of mnj “to die”, while by P. Barguet (1986, 343) as that of mn “to suffer”, but
the right sense was surmised already by D. Meeks (AL l.c.). In addition, H. Willems

Heqaib sanctuary (Elephantine island) of Sirenput I: mn-tw 2z=f “his neck will be
severed”. Alternatively, Willems supposed MK mn to be the old form of NK m«n

(1) GB l.c.: derived from Sem. *myn ~ *mwn, cf. Ar. myn “furchen, spalten” &
“erdichten, lügen”. Also KB l.c.: ~ Ar. myn “to invent, fabricate”. (2) L. Kogan
(SED I 303, #41), in turn, explained it from a primary mng. “seed, sperm” < Sem.

distinguished from Ar. manan “4. certaine manière, façon déterminée” < mny: man3
“3. départir qqch. à qqn., lui assigner une certaine quantité de . . .” [BK II 1159].
(4) Guillaume (1965, IV, 9) combined Hbr. m5n with Ar. fann- “kind, species”, but
Hbr. m- vs. Ar. f- cannot be accepted. (5) Hbr. *m5n was perhaps just a borrowing
from LEg. *mñn, (not its cognate) as suggested by M. Görg (1984). Surprisingly,
KB l.c. explained Eg. mn.t, vice versa, as a loan-word from Hbr. (!), which is an
untenable anachronism.

nb2: The wider Sem. etymology of the NWSem. word is dubious (some scholars
derive it from Sem. *"ny).
! Other solutions are less probable: " 4. A. H. Gardiner (1916, 182), followed by J. Osing (NBÄ 127) and W. Schenkel (1983, 223), derived Eg. mn.t (Osing: lit. “Bleibendes”, sic) ultimately from Eg. mn “bleiben” (Wb) = “to be "rm, established” (Grd.). Unconvincing.

Tigre mela “skill, opinion”, Tna. mela “capacity”, Grg. (most dials.) mäla “occasion,
by chance” (ES-LECu.: Lsl. 1963, 107). The (secondary) meaning of the Tigrinya
word is interestingly identical with that of Eg. mn.t “content (of receptacle)” (Pap.

! Origin a bit uncertain. " 1. In Egyptian linguistics, usually explained from MEg. n wn ~ nn wn “es existiert nicht, es gibt nicht” (Wb I 308, 8–9), which was left unmentioned in EG §108 and Lefébvre 1955, §314–6.

Peust 1999, 163.
nb1: Most of the listed authors accept the common view that m- was due to a
contraction (assimilation) of Auslaut -n# + w-, i.e., *nn-w!n " *nm-m!n "
*mm!n (Lacau l.c.) = orig. *n£'n-wån lit. “es gibt nicht einen Existierenden (etwas
Existierendes)” (Fecht l.c.) = n-wn/*n[ V ]-wán (Peust l.c.). The latter scenario is less
probable, since the assimilation n-w > m is supposed to have taken place in direct
contact of -n# vs. Anlaut w-. K. Sethe (l.c.) assumed a “change” (Wechsel) of m
~ w: *"@mm!n < *"@n-m!n. W. Spiegelberg (l.c.), in turn, did not exclude a shift
nn > mn via dissimilation.
nb2: Strangely, J. ,erný (CED 82) suggested that it was “etymologically the same word

" 2. GT: the apparent communis opinio on LEg. mn < MEg. nn-wn is somewhat disturbed by the fact that (1) traces of mn in the OK can be detected (above), although there is no convincing evidence for an early shift nw > m. In addition, (2) there existed an AA negation morpheme *m-n [GT ].

*ma/3nn- “person of outcaste status, casted worker, tanner”: Mocha m3nn-ó !!! Ch.
*m-n-(t) “to forget”, which are even mutualy unrelated.
*mn “to see” (?), cf. the eye det. of mn “es ist nicht” (NK, Wb II 59) > (???) Dem. mn “to see” (Smith 1984).
nb1: We have several examples of Dem. mn “to see”, including Dem. Pap. BM
10507, Pap. Harkness, and 2 examples in the Hor ostraca, which J. Ray (1976)
did not recognize (kind p.c. by J. Johnson, 15 May 2007). It has been discussed by
M. Smith (1984, 193–210) and F. de Cenival (RdE 29, 1977, 21–37).
nb2: GR mntj “eyes” (Edfu III 4:7, VI 284:14) is hardly a dual of *mn.t, but a
development of GR mnd “das Auge” < BD mn3.t “Teil des Gesichts am Auge”
(Wb II 93, 11–12; PL 440). Thus, it has to be regarded as unrelated.
! Existence as a distinct lexeme dubious. Etymology uncertain. " 1. H. Brugsch (1882, 68) derived both GR mntj and mr.tj from a common etymon with *-l-. False.
nb: As to GR mntj cf. BD mn3.t (discussed above).
" 2. J. D. Ray (1992, 134, n. 15) combined it with Luvian mana- “to see” (sic). Absurd.
nb: The meaning of the Luvian word is debated (cf. HEG l-m, 117).
" 3. GT (contra Takács 1995, 95, #4): the *-n- of Cpt. (SALF) (m)mNetc. “not to be” (CD 166b) hardly allows any connection to Eg. m33 ~ m3n [< *mll] “to see” (above), although the interchange 3 ~ n does not a priori suggest *l (Watson 1980, 47–54). Besides, the var. m3n is restricted only to certain cases (subjunctive, inf.).
nb: Cf. the CT divine name m3-%3-f ~ mn-%3-f, act. *“der hinter sich schaut”
(Satzinger 1994, 200), where the var. form *mn may underly.
mn.t “happy state of being” (late NK, DLE I 217) = “erfreulicher Zustand” (GHWb 334). ! Origin not clear. " 1. R. Hannig (GHWb 334) explains it from mn.t “Art und Weise”. Semantically dubious. " 2.

nb2: K. Naït-Zerrad (l.c.) erroneously compared also Hgr. a-mel “louer, faire d’éloge

mn “to remove, displace” (late NK 1x, DLE I 216) = “déplacer” (AL 77.1704) = “versetzen, beseitigen” (GHWb 335). ! Etymology debated. " 1. D. Meeks (AL l.c.) & R.

compared Sem. *m"n to a certain Eg.-Cpt. m"n “wegtreiben, abstoßen” (sic), while
Guillaume (1965, I, 10) combined Hbr. m"n with Ar. mana"a “macérer la peau
avant de la tanner” [BK II 1156], which is semantically unacceptable.
nb2: On a bicons. basis, Sem. *mn« may be also related, cf. Aram. mn« “!*2)1%-)*.,

clear whether ECh.: Bdy. moo" [-" < *-nH reg.] “effrayer les oiseaux en frappant

" 4. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 206, #1807): ~ Ar. mnn “to cut/tear off ” (sic, contra Lane 3024; BK II 1155) !!! SCu. *mâny- “cleared and enclosed ground” [Ehr. 1980, 154, #16].

nb1: Vocalized *emn$t < *ewn$ty (AEO) = *m'nãt'j, fem. pl. *m'nãtj.'t (NBÄ 776,
n. 958) = *m'n.ãtiô < *m'nô.ãtiô (Snk.).
nb2: Because of its A7 det. (“man sinking to ground from fatigue”), its usual render
ing was declined by W. Vycichl (DELC) who thinks that “ce mot doit signi!er ‘malade’
et non ‘portier’ ”. R. Hannig (GHWb), in turn, assumed the det. A7 to be the carrier
of the nuance “Nachtwächter”. Interestingly, Vycichl (l.c.) claims ,erný not to have
translated NK mn.tj, although CED (l.c.) gives the mng. “porter”.
! Hence: Dem. mnŸ “Türhüter” (DG 165:3; Spg. KHW 62; Thissen 1984, 76) = “porter” (CED) > Cpt. (SLBF) mnout, (BF) emnout “porter, doorkeeper” (CD 176b) = “Türhüter” (KHW 96) = “portier, gardier de la porte” (DELC 117).
nb2: The Cpt. word survives in Eg. Ar. "amn$t “sexton” (Vcl. apud Worrell 1942, 331
quoted by Bishai 1964, 40; Ishaq 1991, 115, §viii.2) = “Küster” (Vittmann apud Snk.)
vs. Upper Eg. Ar. emn$t “portier (d’une église, d’un monastère)” (DELC 117).
! Apparently nomen agentis (-tj) from *mn, whose basic meaning and etymology is disputed: " 1. Following F. L. Grif"th, A. H. Gardiner (AEO I*62), quoted also by J. Vergote (1950, 294) and W. Westendorf (KHW 96 contra 519) derived it (act. *mnw.tj) from Eg. wnw.tj “Stundenbeobachter” (MK, NK, Wb I 317, 9) = “hour-man” (AEO) = “hour-watcher, astronomer” (FD 60) with the shift of w- > m- (*ewn$ty > *emn$t), where “the suspicion arises that jmj-wnw.t is only a late writing of wnwtj, naturally conveying a false etymology ‘he who is in the hour’ . . .” (Grd.). Trying to explain the signi"cant semantic shift, Gardiner views that “it is not unlikely that the hour-watchers when off duty served as temple watchmen, warders or doorkeepers”. Dubious. Declined by W. Vycichl (DELC).
nb1: The change w- > m- worked in a direct contact with the preceding Auslaut
-n#, i.e., there was a merger of -nw- > -m- which otherise did not apply (Lacau
1970, 48–49, §2 & §9–11; Peust 1999, 163–4).
nb2: Ignoring NK mn.tj (not in Wb), F. L. Grif"th (1909, 222, n. 4 & 238, n. 2)
and W. Westendorf (KHW 96) were disposed to explain the Cpt. word directly
from Dem. jmj-wnw.t “the warders (who were guarding)” (AEO) < jmj-wnw.t “der
Stundenbeobachter” (since the end of NK, Wb I 316, 1). Declined by Westendorf (in
the “Nachträge und Berichtigungen” of his KHW 519) as well as W. Vycichl (DELC).
" 2. R. Hannig (GHWb l.c.) surmised a connection with Eg. mnj.tj “ein Ackersmann” (q.v.) and also eventually mnj “Arbeitsdienstler” (q.v.). Not too likely. " 3. W. Schenkel (2002, 22, fn. 64) suggests an etymon *m'nô.ãtiô derived
(as a nomen actoris) from Eg. m( j)nj “anbinden” (sic) > “hüten”. Attractive, although not supported by the orthography.

1905, 209].
" 1. J. Osing (1976, 122, 595, fn. 538) and W. Schenkel (1983, 223) explained the lit. sense of LEg. mn.t as “dauerhaftes, festes Gefäß” derived from Eg. mn “von Dauer sein” (above). Dubious. Rejected by Takács (2004, 208).
nb1: Osing’s translation is based on (B) biniA“Schmelztiegel” and on rejecting the
rendering of LEg. mn.t in Wb etc. He apparently ignored LEg. mn.w “ein Kohl

nb: G. Möller (1921, 193–195), W. Vycichl (1933, 177; 1934, 46), and W. Helck
(1962, 331) combined Brb. *a-man with the hypothetical Eg. *jmn “water”, which
they reconstructed on the basis of the late (not before NK) hrgl. representing an
island with the water sign (n) in it. This combination of hrgls. is to be read jmn in
the name of jmn “Amon” (Wb I 84, 17). This theory would imply dividing the Brb.
word into *a- (article) and root *man (with *-n as part of the root). Both Müller and
Vycichl declined the explanation for the phonetic value of the sign on the basis of
criptography, offered by K. Sethe ( jmn < *jw-m-nw “island with water”). J. Osing
(1976, 703–704, fn. 808) rejected Helck’s etymology.
mnj (orig. *mjnj?) “(eigtl.) anp#ocken: A intr. 1. landen, 2. sterben, B tr. 3. landen lassen, ans Land bringen, 4. (LP, GR) sterben lassen, 5. (ein Land u.ä.) gut lenken” (OK, Wb II 73–74) = “1. to moor (ship, tr.), 2. die, 3. (XVIII.) attach (m) to cult-service” (FD 107) = “1. landen, andocken, anp#ocken, 2. (euph.) sterben” (GHWb 336) = “1. to moor, land, 2. die” (DCT 167).
nb1: Although -j- after m- does not appear in wtg., it is commonly accepted to assume
an original root *mjnj (*mônj) (proposed by K. Sethe 1899 I, §111; ÜKAPT VI 129;
cf. also Müller 1894, 28, fn. 1; 1905, 419, fn. 1; Czermak 1934 II, 235; Vrg. 1973
Ib, 146; DELC 115; Allen 1984, 581) on the basis of the double vowel of the Cpt.
re#exes, which, however, is not attested acc. to CD. W. M. Müller (l.c.): môn (sic),
false. A. H. Gardiner (1905, 120–1) held the theory of Sethe “absolutely certain” and
de"ned the root as mônw. J. Vergote (l.c.): pre-Cpt. *má"na < *máynay. However,
the old rdg. mnj is still mainatined in in some standard works (FD, DCT, PL).
nb2: The basic mng. of the underlying root has also been diversely understood: “to
attach to a peg” (Grd.) = “to be made fast” (Vrg.) = “anp#ocken” (ÜKAPT, Wb,
KHW, etc.) = “accoster” < “attacher à un poteau” (DELC 115). The latter sense
would imply a denom. verb root, which is questionable. Its tr. use was mistranslated
by W. M. Müller (1894, 27–28) as “stoßen, treiben”, later as “vor sich hertreiben,
(an)stoßen” (Müller 1905, 419, fn. 1).
nb3: A. H. Gardiner (1905, 120, fn. 5) considered the frequent metaphorical usage
“to die” (not determined with ship until the NK) to be of unclear origin: perhaps
it derived not directly from the sense “to land”, but perhaps its original mng. was
the restraint which is implied both in the stage of being tied and in that of death.
Kuhlmann (1992, 193), in turn, explained the shift of mng. from a conception where
“offenbar das Bild der Totenbarke im Vordergrund der Assoziation stand, zur Bestattung gehört . . .,
mit der Barke bei Osiris am ‘Hohen Land’ bzw. Ufer, t3 wr, im Westen anzulanden”.
! Hence: Dem. mn “landen” (DG 160:2) > Cpt. (SLBF) amoni, (B) mene-, mane-, manou- “to be made fast, come to land, into port (of ship)” (CD 173).
nb: W. Westendorf, J. ,erný, and W. Vycichl, in turn, gave (S) mo(o)ne, (A)
ma(a)ne, (F) maan(e)I (KHW 94) = (S) moone, (B) amoni (CED 84) = (S) moone,
(B) (a)moni for both (1) “landen”/“to be made fast” and (2) “weiden”/“to pasture,
feed” (sic), although these forms with the Doppelvokal are attributed in CD solely
for “to pasture”.
! From the same root: (1) mnj.t “P#ock an dem das Schiff am Land festgemacht wird, 2. als Werkzeug zum ‘pfählen’ (als Strafe), 3. als Pfahl an welchen der zu Strafende gebunden wird” (OK, Wb II 72–73) = “gewiß . . . ein

Marterinstrument, an welchesder Deliquent gedrückt wird, wohl nur ein eingerammter Pfahl, an den der Deliquent gebunden oder gehalten wird, um Zappeln mit Armen und Füßen zu verhindern” (Pap. Abbott 6:12–13; Spg. in OLZ 2, 1899, 245; cf. OLZ 2/11, 1899, 365) = “le piquet d’amarrage” ( Jéquier 1911, 77, §46; 1921, 74) = “1. mooring-post, 2. whipping-post” (FD 107; AECT III 203; DCT 168) = “pieu” (Aufrère 1990, 433) = “1. Landep#ock (an dem das Schiff festgemacht wird), 2. Pfahl (zum Pfählen als Strafe), 3. Marterpfahl (an den Sünder gebunden werden)” (GHWb 336; ÄWb I 530) = “Landep#ock zum Festmachen des Schiffes, eingeschlagen” (Dürring 1995, 85) = “Marterpfahl (hinter, selten vor dem Gemarterten)” (WD I 87: cf. JEA 58, 1972, 215).
nb: Dif"cult to decide whether mnj.t was a deverbal noun from mnj or vice versa.
(2) mnj + prep. m “1. jemd. mit etwas beschenken, 2. jemd. mit einer Frau verheiraten” (Lit. MK, NK, Wb II 74, 15–16) = “1. to attach to (cult-service), endow with, 2. marry to” (FD 107) = “7. *belohnen (m: mit Äckern)” (GHWb 337).
nb1: Wb II 74 discussed Eg. mnj “beschenken” in a separate entry. But as pointed
out by R. O. Faulkner (FD 107) and R. Hannig (GHWb 336–7), this sense is a
secondary development from “to moor”. Therefore, a connection to AA *m-n “to
give” [GT] (discussed s.v. Eg. mn) is to be excluded.
nb2: As H. Goedicke (1984–85, cf. AEB 85.324) demonstrated, the term mnj
m implies in Sinuhe B 78 that Sinuhe married the girl without having ta pay
anything.
(3) Dem. mne “to ful"l, accomplish successfully (lit. moor)” (Smith 1987, 169). ! Origin debatable. No unambiguous etymology. " 1. GT: most probably, related to NBrb. *mun “se réunir” [GT].

AA *m-n “to join so., accompany” [GT]?
nb2: This Brb.-Ch. root presumably derives from AA *m-n “to attach "rmly” [GT],
cf. NOm.: Wlt. min-t- “to glue” [Lmb.], Dache min-is- “to glue” [Lmb.] !!! Ch. *m-n
“to stick "rmly to sg.” [GT]: WCh.: Hausa mánnà “to gum on to, af"x to”, mánné

stick to”?) | WDng. mììnè “attacher solidement” [Fédry 1971, 130]. This equation
implies that Eg. mnj (*mjnj) derives probably ultimately from the same root as Eg.
mn “to remain” (above) as surmised also by P. Wilson (PL 422).
nb3: Ch. *m-n “full” [GT] may be perhaps also related (via “to join, unite” > “to
make complete”), cf. WCh.: Bole man- “genügen, genug sein” [Lks. 1937, 137]
!! ECh.: Sokoro ménna “voll” [Lks. 1937, 36] | EDng. míné “(r)emplir, combler,

is the Nebensinn of Eg. mnj in CT V 188i: “to saturate (with)” (DCT 167) = “to
af"x” (AECT II 49).
" 2. GT: if, in turn, Eg. mnj was a denom. verb (as usually supposed, cf. Wb, ÜKAPT, KHW, etc.) from mnj.t, the underlying etymon (*mnr.t) might be perhaps equated with NBrb.: Shenwa a-mnar, pl. i-mnar-en “montant vertical de la porte” [Lst. 1912, 147] !!!

1962 MS].
! All further proposals are out of question. " 3. W. M. Müller (1905, 419, fn. 1) combined it with Hbr. m"n “urspr.:
weg/abstoßen”. Semantically unconvincing.
nb1: The basic sense of Sem. *m"n was different, cf. Hbr. m"n piel “sich weigern”
[GB] = “to refuse (to do sg.)” [KB 540], Syr. m(")n “to be abhorrent to s’one” [KB]
!! OSA: Sab. m"n “sich weigern” [GB] (Sem.: GB 393; Müller 1963, 311).
nb2: Müller assumed an early borrowing (!) from Sem.: “man könnte . . . behaupten, das
semit. m"n sei eben als myn in Aegyptische aufgenommen und nur zufällig dann durch inner
ägyptischen Wandel der semit. Form wieder angeglichen worden . . .”.
" 4. W. F. Albright (1918, 231, #49) related Eg. mnj (with the secondary meaning “to die”!) with Ar. manan [*manay-] “1. mort, trépas, 2. destin(ée)” [BK] = “death” [Alb.], both derived from a common Eg.-Sem. *mny “to stretch, make "rm” (sic), whence he explained also Ar. manna, Hbr. "mn, Eg. jmn “to conceal” and mn “to remain”.
Perfectly wrong.
nb: The basic meanings of Eg. mnj vs. Ar. *manay- (act. “fate”) are fully different,
cf. Sem. *mny “to share out” [GT]: Ug. mn-t “Teil, Glied, Portion” [GT] !! Ar.
mny “départir qqch. à qqn.” [BK II 1158–9] = “zumessen” [WUS] (Sem.: WUS

have nothing to do with Eg.-Sem. *mny.

" 6. M. Lubetsky (1978–79, cf. AEB 33, 1979, 49–50, #79.225) assumed a change of Eg. m( j)nj < *mnl, which he af"liated with NHbr. of TTM l5m5n ~ lim5n(3) “Hafen, Bucht” [Levy 1924 II, 501] = l5m1n “Hafen” [Dalman 1922, 218] = also l2m1n “haven, bay” [ Jastrow 1950, 712] as well as Gk. 4&2@" “port” [Boisacq]. He assumed a common Eg.-Sem. root *lmn, whereby the Gk. term derived either via Hbr. or Eg. Absurd.
nb: The NHbr. word cannot be a cognate of Eg. mnj, since it is merely late bor
rowing of the Gk. term, which, in turn, comes from the IE heritage, cf. Gk. 4!&2G"
“tout lieu humide, prairie, pelouse”, 412B" “eau stagnante, marais, étang, lac” < IE
*slei- (Boisacq 1916, 565).
" 7. Ch. Ehret (1995, 307, #590) derived Eg. mnj “moor” from AA *-ma/ un/—/Ÿ- “to tie up” based on the false equation of MSA *mn« “to
take, catch, hold” !!! Eg. mn0 “to string” !!! Cu. *ma/unÉc- “to twist (e.g. in making rope)”. Impossible
nb: Ehret derived the secondary meaning of mnj (“to die”) from a distinct AA root,
namely *-mdn- “to lose, lack, be without” > Ar. mn« “to refuse, hinder, prevent”
!!! Eg. mn “there is not” !!! NOm. *mo(:)nn- “person of outcaste status” !!! Ch. *m
n-(t) “to forget” (!).
" 8. N. Skinner (1995, 30) derived Eg. mnj “to die” from his AA *mw/y- “death, hunger” (sic). False. " 9. GT: the similarity to Ar. m5n-at- ~ m5n3"- “rade, port” [BK II
1175] > NAram. (Ba0«a) m5na “Hafen” [Correll 1969, 171] is mis
leading, being due to pure chance.
nb: The Ar. term is traditionally (BK) derived from Ar. wny “abandonner” [BK
II 1612]. Note that M. Lubetsky (1978–79, cf. AEB 33, 1979, 49–50, #79.225)
explained Ar. "al-m5n3" via Cpt. (!) ultimately from Eg. mnj (!), which is baseless.
" 10. GT: because of Cpt. -n-, a comparison with Brb. *2-m2l “arriver à” [Ksm.] is out of question.

be cognate with Eg. m3« (q.v.).

nb1: Whether the verb mnj is denom. from mnj.w or vice versa “can hardly be deter

Alternatively (von Bissing apud Jéquier 1921, 74, fn. 7), it was a “collier d’animal”, lit. “l’attacheur, le !xeur”. In either cases, Jéquier suggested an etymological connection with Eg. mnj.t “piquet” (above). " 3. W. Westendorf (ZÄS 94, 1967, 145), followed by L.

Handgriff des Hathorsymbols ursprünglich ein phallusartiger Tampon war”), whereby Westendorf suggested a connection (“wenigstens im Wortspiel”) with Eg. mn.t “thigh, womb” (sic). Far-fetched.
nb1: The basic sense of Eg. mn.t had nothing to do with “vulva”, for which other
words were used. Moreover, the -j does not appear in the wtg. of mn.t “thigh”.
nb2: J. Quaegebeur (BSFE 98, 1983, 17–39), followed by P. Springborg (1990, 112f.,
135f.), in turn, saw in mnj.t a symbol of regeneration (Nagy 1977, 205 & fn. 51
with further lit.) consisting of a pair of testicles (in spite of noted studies on the
subject, cf. LÄ IV 53), which was doubted by J. G. Grif"ths (1994, 238): “why should
a goddess of sexuality symbolically sling a pair of testicles around her neck?”. Nevertheless, he
too, assumed the sacred necklace of Hathor to consist of testicles, namely those of
Seth with regard to some Ptol. texts suggesting that the mnj.t “was given to the goddess
to secure her aid in the destruction of Seth”.
" 4. GT: a comparison with Akk. (Amarna, Qatna, Alalakh) maninnu “ein Halsschmuck” [AHW 603] = “a necklace” [CAD m1, 211] is equally to be excluded.

nb3: The similarity with Aram. of TTM m3n3" “4. P#ug” is misleading (basic
mng. “Gerät” < *)"ny).
! Other solutions are unlikely: " 2. W. M. Müller (1894, 28, fn. 1) was disposed to relate it either with Ar. ma"n- “bois de la charrue sur lequel on adapte le soc” [BK II
1054] or Hbr. mn" (sic, mng. not indicated).
" 3. C. W. Goodwin (1867, 85–86) combined it with Eg. *mr “hoe” (with a false var. *mn) as well as a number of untenable parallels. Similarly, Seibert (1967, 116, n. d) ruled out a connection to Eg. mnj.t “(Lande)P#ock” and pondered an eventual derivation from Eg. mrj.t “als Name der Hieroglyphe: die hölzerne Hacke” (LP, Wb II 98, 11) with reservations (as to whether it is “lautgeschichtlich” correct). False, since -n- + -r-. " 4. An etymological connection with Eg. mnj “Zwangsarbeiter” (q.v.) assumed by Baillet (1907, 6, §18 with doubts) and R. Hannig (GHWb l.c.) is unlikely.
nb1: Eg. mnj might have denoted a quite different type of work (discussed above).
nb2: Equally unconvincing are the alternative Eg. etymologies offered by Baillet
(1907, 6, 21): (1) mn2.w “captifs étrangers, Arabes (!), gens de la montagne ou des
sables (?)” or (2) m-mn.t > (S) !mine “quotidie” ! mnj.tj lit. “journaliers” or
(3) mjn “today” (mistranslated “journée”).
" 5. N. Skinner (1996, 209) assumed a met. from *nmj identi"able with WCh.: Hausa nóómáá “farming”, nóómà “to till, work (farm)”, nóómè “to till, weed all of ” [Abr. 1962, 706], Gwnd. noma [met. of *mona?] “to do farm-work with large hoe”, nòmu “to be cultivated”

nb: Skinner proposed also a number of untenable parallels, e.g. ES: Grg.: Chaha

mnj.t (particles det.) “als Material zu kleinen Figuren” (XIX–XX., Wb II 76, 9) = “a semi-precious stone or resin: a species of resinous material occasionally employed in the manner of precious stones” (Harris 1961, 172) = “ein Material: *Menitperlen, Harzkügelchen” (GHWb 338) = “ein Produkt für die Vorbereitung eines Salbmittels” (Koura 1999, 171 & fn. 189).

stela 45: “as the label beside a necklet, although this may be the name of the object
rather than its material”; Amon-hymn of Leiden 1:8: “a species of resin”), Harris
(l.c.) considers the third one as a distinct word, although resin was used for beads
and other small objects (Lucas 1948, 444).
! Etymology debated. " 1. J. R. Harris (1961, 171) and B. Koura (1999, 171) af"liated it with Eg. mnj “ruddle (?)” (Grd., discussed above), which Koura ultimately explained from the lit. mng. “das Bleibende” derived from Eg. mn “bleiben”. Dubious.
nb: This comparison was extended by Harris also to NK mn “ein Produkt aus Syrien
von schwarzer Farbe” (XVIII–XIX., Wb, q.v.) = “either a semi-precious stone or
even a resin or a form of red ochre” (Harris).
" 2. GT: if, in turn, the mng. “bead” and its identi"cation with MK mnj.t “necklace” is correct, it may derive perhaps from *mnr.t, cf. LECu.: Sam: Boni munyúur “Perle” [Heine 1977, 290] = Boni (Bireeri dial.) munyúùr “beads” [Heine 1982, 93] | Yaaku múnyúrí, pl. múnyúr “chain” [Heine 1975, 122].
mnj.t (wood det.) “cornice (?)” (late NK 1x, DLE I 218) = “*Gesims” (GHWb 338). ! Origin obscure. GT: the following alternatives are to be accounted for: (1) Perhaps Eg. mnj.t < *mnr.t ~ NBrb.: Qbl. a-mna8 “1. seuil, 2. linteau”, ta-mna8-t “petite marche” [Dlt. 1982, 506]?

Etymology not yet clear. " 1. W. M. Müller (1909, 186) erroneously linked it to Eg. rmn “shoulder”, which he explained from *jmn (!) > Cpt.: (S) amoni “to seize, possess, detain” (CD 8a), treating r- as a “false archaisation”. " 2. J.

Walker (1996, 269): “a formation in m-” of Eg. nj3 ~ nj “underside of forearm” (Med., Walker) = “Körperteil, in einer Schwangerschaftsuntersuchung parallel zu den Fingern des Artzes genannt” (WMT 446) = “avant-bras dont la main a la paume retournée” (Keimer 1957, 97–99 after Lefébvre 1955, 349: D41).

" 1. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 168) and M. Cohen (1947, #37) identi"ed it with Bed. amna “Kindbetterin, Wöchnerin, Amme” [Rn. 1895, 19] = “woman in child-bed” [Rpr. 1928, 149].
nb1: A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 65) rejected this Eg.-Bed. comparison. He emphasized
that the meaning of Bed. amna was not “nurse”, but rather “woman in childbed”,
act. *”woman having given birth not long ago ("0()-"!# =!(3-;):# 50"43"))”.
Following L. Reinisch (1895, 19), Dolgopol’skij equated Bed. amna with Agaw
*k-b-n ! *k-m-n [assim.] “to give birth”, which is phonologically unacceptable
(Bed. Ø-/6- + Agaw *k-).
nb2: M. Cohen (1947, #37) combined the Bed. and Eg. forms with Sem.: Hbr.
"om1n “attendant”, "omenet “nurse” [KB 64] = ".men (sic) “tutor, educator”, fem.
“nourrice” [Chn.], cf. NHbr. ".menet “governess, preceptress, nurse” [Šapiro 1963],
which can be only an alternative etymology for Bed. amna. W. F. Albright (BASOR
94, 18, fn. 28), in turn, explained the Hbr. word as a back-formation from *"omn5m
(pl.) < *"umm3n5m ~ Akk. umm3nu “Menschenmenge” [AHW 1413].
" 2. A. Ember (1926, 302, fn. 10; quoted also by F. von Calice 1936, #626) equated Eg. mn« with Ar. ma3ila “allaiter un enfant étant
enceinte d’un autre” [BK II 1133] = “to suckle” [Alb.] = “to be pregnant” [Clc.]. Unlikely due to both met. and Ar. -l- + Eg. *-n-.

and q), cf. e.g. NBrb.: Izn. & Rif. & Snh. e-n3 “tuer, assassiner” [Rns. 1932, 394]

nb3: The AA etymology of Brb. *n-3 is highly disputed. (1) GT: most probably
akin to Ar. na0a«a “2. égorger un animal en portant le couteau au haut du cou,
presque au haut de la colonne vertébrale, 3. (en gén.) tuer, mettre à mort, anéantir”
~ var. naqa«a “7. tuer qqn., 12. égorger un chameau pour ses hôtes, 13. éclater

60; 1987, 399), which J. Vergote (1945, 133, #3.c.8) connected with with Eg. nq«
“schneiden” (WMT 485) = “to tingle, prick” (late NK, DLE II 36) = “(das Herz)

" 4. GT: with regard to the sense of Eg. «mn.t, the etymology of
the Eg. root might be NBrb.: Qbl. l-b!unya “poing”, a-b!unyiw, pl. i-b!unyiw-en “1. boxeur, 2. bagarreur, 3. fort” [Dlt. 1982, 30].
nb1: In this case we should suppose Eg. mn« ~ *«mn < *bn« ~ *«bn = Qbl.
b-n-y < *b-n-«.
nb2: The Qabyle root occurs in Maghrebi Arabic too (Qbl. l-b!unya contains the Ar.
def. article), but it is dif"cult to suppose an Arabic origin, since the Maghrebi Ar. root
has no Sem. background (cf. DRS 71). On the other hand, K. Naït-Zerrad (DRB
I 80–81) does not discuss the etymology of the Qbl. root either. The connection to
Fr. poing seems also to be excluded. The origin of this Qbl. root is obscure.

nb: GW: ma-n-«á-tá (Helck) = ma-n-«a-ta [*ma«anta/*man«ata?] (Hoch).
! Origin debated. " 1. J. C. Hoch (1994, 127, §163) a priori assumed it to be a loanword from Sem. and suggested three alternative etymologies: (1) Sem. *«wn “to dwell” > BHbr. m2«on3 “dwelling place”, MHbr.
m3«.n “residence”, Phn. m«wn “temple”; (2) Sem. *mn« “to hold
back” > Ar. man3«-at “to be strongly forti"ed, impregnable”; (3)
“less likely” Sem. *nw0 “to rest” > BHbr. m2n$%3 “resting place”, neither of which is convincing (either semantically, geographically or phonologically).
nb: The assumption of the Sem. origin was uncritically adopted by J. Osing (2001,
572: “deutlich wie ein nicht-äg. Wort geschrieben”) and J. F. Quack (2002, 173), who, how
ever, did not detail which one of the three false etymologies they prefer. Disproved
by G. Takács (2005, 67–68, #5.3).
" 2. G. Takács (EDE I 96–97; 2005, 67–68, #5.3 & fn. 202): in spite of its GW, perhaps it represents a native word, which goes back to AA *m-n-« “1. to (take) hold (of ), 2. possess (or sim.)” [GT]?

nb: A. R. Bomhard (1986, 248) and L. Kogan (SED l.c.) suggest that Ar. mny I “to
ejaculate” vs. mny V “to desire” are etmologically related. The latter author traced
back Sem. *mny “to desire, wish, want” via “to have sexual desire” to a primary
sense “to discharge sperm, exude vaginal secretion” purely on the basis of the Ar.
mng. This semantic connection (or contamination?) is especially apparent in Gurage
*mny where both senses (“to wish” vs. “to have sexual intercourse”) are attested (Lsl.
1979 III, 414). The semantic connection of “to wish” ~ “to copulate” is indeed
plausible, cf. e.g. Sem. *ptw “to desire, love”: Ug. pty “to tup” [Gordon 1955, 314,

! Other solutions are less credible or false: " 5. G. Ebers (1868, 71–72) spoke of a Phn. origin (!) and considered the name to signify “mit Bezug auf den Phallus . . . der Aufgerichtete”. Baseless. " 6. A. Roccati (1970, 35, n. b): Eg. mnj.w (or mjn.w) “pastore” (with god-det.) “. . . è certamente in relazione con Min”. This derivation was supported by H. Goedicke (1999). Rather unlikely.
nb: Alternatively, Roccati (1970, 34, n. e) quoted a pun on Min in CT VII 168c:
jr mnmn=j mnmn=j m mnw “se mi scuoto, mi scuoto come Min”. Goedicke (l.c.) sees
e.g. in the epithet of Horus “Hirte der Herde seines Vaters” a justi"cation of this
theory.
" 7. H. Goedicke (1999, 96) suggested alternatively (as a “recht spekulative anmutende Erklärung”) a derivation from Eg. mn “bleiben” (i.e., a primary sense *mn.w “Bleibender”).

! Basic meaning and origin disputed. " 1. In Egyptian philology (e.g., Grd. 1915, 66; DELC 109), usually explained from Eg. mn “to remain”, lit. *“Bleibendes” (Wb) = “Aufenthalt (sic), *Dauer, Dauerhaftes” > “(seit MR) (sic) Denkmal” (Osing, NBÄ 548).
nb: If the common rendering of Eg. mnw as “monument” is correct, this etymology
seems much more convincing than any other proposal. Nevertheless, if the basic
meaning was “sign” (as preserved by Coptic), solution #2 should be preferred.

(1984, 271, #275) equated IE *m2/an- “to think, re#ect” with Sem. *mny “to count,
reckon”. It may be indeed supposed that the underlying root was AA *m-n “1. to
count, 2. think, 3. know” [GT]. For the shift of meaning in Sem. *mnw, cf. e.g. Eg.
%sb “to count” ~ Sem. *%šb “to think”. Deriving Eg. mnw “monument” from AA
*m-n “to think” seems also defendable, cf. e.g. German Denkmal vs. denken.

nb1: Eg. nm is usually listed as nm« in the standard dictionaries (so also apud Osing
1998, 81, n. v). With respect to PT mnm.t, XIX. nmnm.w, (B) -nim “to sleep”
(below), and Sem. *nwm, however, the Amarna form must have been evidently a GW
for nm (with the combination of m & « for m so frequent in MK-NK orthography)
as pointed out already by W. Vycichl (1990, 234; DELC 139) and J. Hoch (1994,
185–6, §249): “le groupe m« signi!e tout simplement m et l’absence de formes à voyelle brisée
en copte montre clairement qu’il n’y avait pas de «ayin dans le mot égyptien” (Vcl.). “The «ayin
was probably erroneously inserted by confusion with either nm« ’to be partial’ or the verb ‘to cover,
spread’ . . .”. The origin of Amarna nm (GW nm«) has been strongly debated. E.g.,
(1) A. Baillet (1881–83, 35, fn. 1) af"liated it with nm« “Mauern mit feinem Stein
bekleiden” (late NK, Wb II 266) = “maçonner” (Baillet) = “to build” (Caminos
1954 LEM, 351) = “to line with stone, build” (Badawy 1956–57, 71) = “to set out,
lay down walls” (DLE II 19) = “to cover, spread” (Hoch 1994, 186), which is hardly
tenable for semantical reasons. (2) J. E. Hoch (1994, 185–186, #249–250) treated
it as a Sem. loan-word, which was rightly rejected by (3) J. F. Quack (1996, 510),
who, in turn, traced it back to a basic meaning *“sich auf die Seite legen” with
respect to Eg. nm« “parteiisch sein (bes. beim Richten)” (MK, NK, Wb II 267, 1)
= “to be one-sided, partial” (FD 133; DLE II 20) = “voreingenommen, parteiisch
sein (bes. beim Richten)” (GHWb 413). This explanation is by no means convincing,
because NK nm “to sleep” goes back to an unattested OEg. *nm [< *nwm], whose
existence is corroborated by the PT nomen loci mnm.t and Sem. *nwm.
nb2: Cpt. (SALF) -nhb, (B) -nim in compound with hi- (Vcl.: < %wj “battre”?) “1.
dormir, 2. (m) sommeil” (DELC 139) has been explained either from Amarna nm
(Vcl. 1983, 139; 1990, 234) or as a loan-word from Sem. *nwm (Lambdin 1987,
186, fn. 43). Vycichl (l.c.): *n5baw ~ *n5maw < *niybaw < *nim/byaw < *)nmj.
Lambdin (l.c.): < *n1m < *n$m.
nb3: There are some untenable proposals as to the etymology of Sem. *nwm. H.
Möller (1911, 175) explained it from a biconsonantal *nw- > Sem. *nwp “sich
hin- und herbewegen”, *nw3 “(sch)wanken”, Ar. nw*: n3*a “movit (ramum)”, nwt:
n3ta “to move from side to side in walking”. MM 1983, 246, §II.8: ~ Ar. n5m

re#exes are to be explained via assim. (Dera and Smr. gr. from *n-w-m) and met.,
resp. (Mokilko from *n.m-?).
nb5: Sha munu-munyà “Schlafplatz, Bett” [ Jng. 1970, 287] is unrelated, originating
(as nomen loci) from PRon *nya(h) “to sleep” [GT] (Ron: JI 1994 II, 298), which
is clearly incompatible with Sem. *nwm (in spite of the suggestion by Ch. Rabin
1982, 28, #32). JI 1994 I 154 consided the Ron root as a borrowing from NC *na
“to sleep”. Cf. perhaps also ECh.: Ngam Ÿà:Ÿe: [< *n-y-H?] “coucher avec femme,

" 3. H. P. Blok (1930, 24), P. Kaplony (1969, 37, fn. 33), and P. Wilson (PL 430) derived it from Eg. mnmn “to move” (q.v.), which would suggest a literal meaning *“etwas, das sich bewegt, die wogende Menge der Herdentiere” (Blok). Not too convincing.

" 4. G. Takács (1995, 105–106, #3; 1996, 135, #28) explained it from the basic meaning *„building” (hence “fortress” due to a contamination with Eg. mn “"rm”) comparing AA *m-(y)-n “1. to create, 2. build” > AA *min- “house” [GT].

nb2: For a different interpretation of PT 662 mnnj (< mnj “landen”) see ÜKAPT

" 2. J. Hoch (l.c.), ignoring, Faulkner’s idea, a priori assumed a Sem. borrowing, although he himself admitted that “no convincing etymology can be proposed”.
" 3. W. A. Ward (1996, 28, §167), too, saw in it a “native Eg. lexeme”, which “must be a colloquial term derived from mnj ‘moor (a boat)’, in its common derived sense ‘to die; death’, hence the place of death, an appropriate term for either a sarcophagus or burial chamber”. Far-fetched, since there are many other parts of a tomb that might be explained this way.

nb1: Mostly read as mnnn (Wb, Harris, CED, KHW, Fuchs, GHWb, PL, Koura,
WD, etc.), while Aufrère (1990 l.c.) suggested mnn, which seems preferable in the
light of the Cpt. re#ex.
nb2: Lucas (1948, 384f.) hold the sense “bitumen” (part of the embalming procedure
only from the GR times) to be unlikely
! Hence: Cpt. (B) miolwn ~ miolon ~ mholon “bitumen (extracted from embalmed corpses)” (CD 165a; CED 81) = “Bitumen, Pech” (KHW 89) = “bitume” (DELC 109).
nb: E. Chassinat (1921, 65; 1922, 463) doubted the identity of Eg. mnnn with the
Cpt. word.
" 1. Its traditional comparison with its synonym (in the Cpt. scalae), Ar. m$miy3- “sorte de bitume auquel on attribue des vertus vulnéraires extraordinaires” [Vcl.] = “Mumie” [KHW] > Mand. mumi(i)a “piss-asphalt, a kind of bitumen used as ointment and preservative” [DM 262], maintained by V. Loret (1894, 161), W. Westendorf (KHW 89), and W. Vycichl (DELC 109 with further lit.), has serious (phonological) drawbacks and can in no way be accepted.
nb: This etymology does not account for the presence of *-l- in the Eg. word, and
ignores that Eg. -n- + Ar. -m-. Moreover, Ar. m$m- “wax” was borrowed from Pers.
m$m “Erdpech oder Bitumen” (so also Hannig 2006, 15).
" 2. A. NiwiIski (1992, 468) derived it (and mn denoting a product of black colour) from Eg. mn “to be "rm, established, remain”. He regarded it “imaginable that the black substance mn or mnnn used in the mummi!cation process was intended to make the mummy like a monument (mnw) as !rm (mn) as a fortress (mnw)”.
" 3. GT: with regard to LEg. mnr and Cpt. -l-, it may be supposed that Eg. mnnn re#ects *mll ~ *mnll (or the like) > PCpt. *miolol. As noted by W. Vycichl (DELC 109), the "nal syllable in Cpt.

compared Eg. nhp with NBrb.: Beni Snus tu-fu-t “matin” !!! SBrb.: Tuareg (sic) u-fu
“commencer à faire clair pour”, which is out of question. Brb. *ta-faw-t “sunshine”
[Mlt. 1991, 259] is cognate with Sem. *wp« ~ LEg. p«p« (GR, EDE II, q.v.). (4)
P. Lacau (1972, 58, §26.7): ~ Hbr. n"p, which is semantically out of question.
mnhp “der Begatter” (GR, Wb II 82, 17) = “procreator (of the ram of Mendes)” (Smith) = “Begetter” (PL 431). ! From the same root: (1) mnhp “phallus et dos réunis” (Yoyotte, BIFAO 61, 141; AC 1978, 14) = “appareil génital” (AL 78.1738) = “Phallus” (WD II 61); (2) mnhp “ein Aphrodisiacum” (GR, Wb II 82, 18) = “aphrodisiac plant” (PL 431) = “‘Mittel zum Begatten’-P#anze (nicht feststellbar, welche Name ist)” (Germer 2002, 126). ! It derives (by pre"x m-), as pointed out by H. Grapow (1914, 24), H. Smith (1979, 162), and P. Wilson (PL), from Eg. nhp “bespringen (vom Stier), begatten (vom Menschen)” (OK, Wb II 284, 3–4) = “to copulate” (FD 135) = “to procreate” (Smith).
nb: The etymology of this root has been disputed: (1) K. Sethe (ÜKAPT ad PT
582b) and M.-Th. Derchain-Urtel (1973, 43): the meaning of Eg. nhp was secondary
(euphemistic) < Eg. nhp “to spring” (XVIII., Wb II 283–284) = “to pulsate” (FD
135). (2) Others, however, prefer equating it with Hbr. n"p “to commit adultery,
ehebrechen” [GB 477], which is questionable due to the irregular Eg. -h- vs. Hbr.
-"- (cf. EDE I 294–5). Lit. for Eg.-Hbr.: Erman 1892, 113; Ember 1911, 89; 1930,
#8.a.3, #11.a.27, #13.b; GB 477; Trb. 1923, 137, #247; GÄSW 164, #663; Chn.
1947, #446; Vcl. 1960, 175; DELC 151. (3) M. Cohen (1947, #446) extended the
Eg.-Hbr. etymology to a certain Brb. *)n-b-y “coïter (en parlant de l’homme)”, which
is out of question, since – to the best of my knowledge – it exists only in SBrb.:
Ahaggar e-nbi “monter (une femme), accomplir l’acte sexuel” [Foucauld 1951–52
III, 1288], while in almost all other Brb. lgs. it denotes “to taste” (eventually PBrb.
*m*i, cf. Ksm. 1999, 191, #560), which may be the primary sense the metaphoric
and euphemistic Hgr. mng. might have derived from.
mnhz “Wächter (von Göttern)” (PT 816a, XVIII., Wb II 83, 2) = “Wachender” (Grapow 1914, 25) = “Bewachender” (AÄG 110, §256) = “watcher” (Smith 1979, 161; PL 432) = “Wächter (von Göttern), Bewachender” (ÄWb I 535). ! Derives (via participial m- pre"x) from Eg. nhzj “er-, aufwachen aus dem Schlaf ” (OK, Wb II 287), cf. Grapow 1914, 25; Ol’derogge 1956, 7; Smith 1979, 161; PL 432.
300 mnhp – mnhz



nb: The etymology of this root is obscure. GT: cf. either (1) Sem. *nhz (?): Mand.
)nhz “to move noisily, cause disturbance, clatter about, bluster about, reel about,
move boisterously, violently, shake about, struggle violently” [DM 291], Syr. )nhz
“to arouse commotion, excite” [DM] ! Ar. nahaza “6. lever la tête en se mettant
en marche (se dit d’une bête)” [BK II 1355]; (2) or, as irreg. match (or a root var.
to Sem. *nhz?), PClass. Yemeni Ar. nkz I: nukuz “to be frightened from a sudden
noise, wake up (intr.)”, II “to wake up, disturb” [Piamenta 1990, 497]?
mnh& “das Schreibgerät” (PT, XVIII., Wb II 83, 3) = “a writing out"t” (Grd. 1915, 65) = “écritoire” (Lacau 1954, 88, fn. 2) = “scribe’s palette” (FD 109) = “das Schreibzeug, das alte aus Steinpalette, Farbbeutel und Binsenkapsel zusammengesetzte Gerät (noch im A.R. durch eine neuartige Palette gstj ersetzt)” (Schott 1968, 46) = “das Schreibgerät, die Palette, Schreibpalette (älteren Typs)” (ÄWb I 535).
nb: H. Grapow (l.c.) and A. H. Gardiner (l.c.) both read it erroneously mn%3 (sic,
-%-).
! Apparently a nomen instr. (as already suggested by H. Grapow 1914, 25) derived (via m- pre"x) from an unattested Eg. *nh3, which is dif"cult to identify.
nb: Perhaps lit. *“tool of drawing (lines)”? Cf. Ar. naha6a “1. tracer, frayer un
chemin, 2. être bien tracé, frayé, distinct (se dit d’une grand’route), 3. suivre un
chemin” [BK II 1352], which, however, derives from Sem. *nhg “to drive” [GT],
cf. Lsl. 1987, 393.
mn# (orig. mn#j?) “Papyrus oder eine ähnliche Sumpfp#anze” (MK, Wb II 83, 8; Germer 1988, 249) = “papyrus-plant” (FD 109; DCT 169) = “Cyperus papyrus L.” (Germer 1979, 138–9 with detailed discussion) = “reeds, plants” (DLE I 221) = “(*junger) Papyrus (Cyperus papyrus *antiquorum): *‘Jüngling’ ” (GHWb 340; ÄWb I 535) = “a less usual term for papyrus, the symbolic plant of Lower Egypt (may have denoted a certain type of papyrus, or perhaps speci"cally the tuber or stem of the papyrus plant, or the papyrus at a certain stage of maturity)” (PL 432) = “Zypergras, Papyrusstaude” (Germer 2002, 81).

of Eg. -%- > Gk. -?- on the analogy of Eg. w%3.t “oasis” > Gk. C)?&7 and discussing
on pp. 310–4 the late alternation of Gk. intervocalic *-?- > *-h-/-Ø- ~ -?-).
! Fem.: mn%.t “Papyrusstengel” (NK, Fischer-Elfert 1986, 54).
nb: The name of the goddess mn%(j).t “she of the papyrus-plant (whose milk is
sweet: bnj-jr2.t)” (CT VII 205k, AECT III 101–2, spell 993, n. 6; DCT 169; cf.
Jéquier 1921, 14) is regarded by R. O. Faulkner (AECT l.c.) as the origin of mn%j.t
(Wb II 84, 3–8) applied to a number of goddesses often depicted as bearing a
papyrus-stem staff. Note that H. Smith (1979, 162), in turn, derived this name (as
“doubtless”) from Eg. mn% “to slaughter”.

! Origin obscure: " 1. H. Brugsch (1882, 68), A. Erman (1892, 111), and F. von Calice (GÄSW #628) suggested that it was an early loan from NWSem., cf. Hbr. mall$a% “Melde (Gk. X4&297), atriplex halimus Linn., ein salatähnliches Gewächs, dessen junge Blätter roh und gekocht eine Speise armer Leute abgaben” [GB 426] = “Mesembrianthemum Forskalii” [Löw] = “oarche, Atriplex Halimus (eaten as food by the poor), mallow, saltwort” [Hölscher] = “salt-weed” [KB 587] = “a salt-marsh plant” [Hnrg.], PBHbr. mall$a% “Melde, ein salatähnliches Gewächs, dessen junge Blätter den Armen als Speise dienten” [Levy 1924 III 127]. Improbable both semantically and because of Gk. -"-.
nb: Hbr. mall$a%, along with Akk. ma/ulla0tu “ein salziges Gras” [AHW 596] and
Ar. mullay%- “sorte de plante (reaumuria vermiculata)” [BK 1145], derives from
Sem. *mil%- “salt” [Hnrg. 2000, 2065].
" 2. R. Hannig (GHWb & ÄWb l.c.) suggested an etymological connection with Eg. mn% “Jüngling, Bursche” (NK, Wb, below).
nb: In Edfu VII 173:9–10 (also Edfu III 193:3), the verb mn% “to make young”
is used in a pun on mn% “papyrus” to parallel w33 “papyrus” vs. “child” ~ w33
“green or young” (PL 432).
" 3. GT: or any connection with LECu.: Saho malñ% (m) “eine P#anzensorte (Bilin takan3), als Futterkraut sehr geschätzt” [Rn. 1890, 266]? Doubtful because of Gk. -"-.
nb: Dif"cult to decide whether the similarity with LECu.: Orm.-Borana mell-3 “a
papyrus-like reed, found in swampy areas” [Strm. 1995, 209] is only accidental (no
trace of *-%- in Orm.), cf. rather Eg. m3.t [< *ml.t] “das Rohr des Schilfs” (OK,
Wb, q.v.). In principle, Orm. mell- < *mel%- is plausible.
mn#.w “Schaum (auf den Lippen einer wütenden Göttin)” (XVIII., Wb II 84, 10; GHWb 340) = “froth on lips” (FD 109). ! G. Takács (lit. infra): presumably, it re#ects AA *m-l-% “to exude bodily ef#ux (orig. of abscess?)” [GT].

of Eg. -0 + Cpt. -k, who derived the Cpt. verb from Eg. mnq (q.v.).
! Origin obscure. The lack of AA cognates with m- indicates probably a nomen instr. with m-. " 1. W. Westendorf (1973, 138) assumed an Eg. etymon *mn0 whence he explained both mn0 “mit dem Meißel arbeiten” (lit. “treffen”) & mn0 “Meißel” (lit. “tref#ich”, sic) and mn0 “fähig, tüchtig, tref#ich” on the analogy of German tref#ich < treffen ~ OEng. drepan “schlagen, stoßen” as well as German tauglich, tüchtig (derived from the basic sense “herrichten, herstellen”). Dubious.
nb: Westendorf derived Eg. mn0 “Bez. für große Haufen” (XXII., Wb II 87, 5),
lit. *”Stöße”, too from the same etymon (but cf. WD III 52 after SAK 22, 1995,

mn# 313



" 1. H. Lallemand (1923, 87–98) saw in it a metaphoric usage (lit. “solide”) of Eg. mn0 the basic idea of which he "gured as “assemblage, "xation, monter (en joaillerie)” on the basis of its supposed connection with Eg. mn0 “menuisier” (q.v.) " “former un ouvrage à l’aide d’instruments” " “bien travailler” " “bien, faire de bonnes oeuvres, être bienfaisant, généreux” (sic). " 2. W. Westendorf (1973, 139) suggested a different scenario: he regarded “tref#ich, fähig, tüchtig” as a secondary "gurative sense (lit.) of his hypothetic Eg. *mn0 “treffen”, whence he explained also Eg. mn0 “(mit dem) Meißel (arbeiten)” (OK, Wb, q.v.). Uncertain.
nb: As parallels for the semantic shift Westendorf quoted the alleged connection
of (1) Eg. %mw “Steingefäße ausbohren” ~ %mw.w “kunstfertig, geschickt” ~ %m
“Keule (mit dem man auf den mn0-Meißel schlägt)”; (2) German tref#ich < treffen
~ OEng. drepan “schlagen, stoßen”; (3) German tauglich, tüchtig derived by him
falsely from the basic sense “herrichten, herstellen” (contra Kluge 1999, 818).
" 3. Similarly, J. Osing (NBÄ 101, 581, n. 483) equated Eg. mn0 “Meißel” > (B) maJoul “Meißel” vs. Eg. mn0 “vortref#ich herstellen” > Cpt. (P) me01l “Heilung bringen, heilen” (q.v.), but he failed to suggest a satisfactory explanation for the semantic problems. Moreover, both Cpt. forms probably belong to two distinct etymons. " 4.

314 mn#



*ml% was not “good, nice” but “salty”, the eventual source being Sem. *mil%- “salt”
[Frz. 1971, 634, #7.46] as usually assumed in the lit. (recently cf., e.g., Gordon 1955,
288, #1117; Ward 1963, 427, fn. 2; Vcl. 1988, 485; 1989, 34; Durand 1995, 150;
Mlt. 2006 MS, 24, #34.6). This derivation is most evident in Ar. mal5%- “1. salé,
qui a un goût salé (eau, etc.), ou dont l’eau est salée (puits), 2. salé (poisson), 3.
beau de visage etc.”, which is a pass. part. of malu%a “1. être salé (eau de mer), 2.
être beau de visage etc.” [BK II 1144–5]. Or cf. Akk. 9abtu “Salz” < 9yb “schön,
gut sein” [AHW 1377].
nb2: The semantic connection of “salty” ~ “nice” was declined by W. Leslau
(1968, 358, #1482) arguing that Ar. malu%a means primarily “to be beautiful,
nice”. Similarly, M. Dahood (1965, 64, #1482) rejected the equation of Ug. ml%
“good” with Ar. mal5%- and preferred to derive the former from Sem. *l%% “to be
fresh, succulent”. A. Zaborski (1991, 1689) consideres the Eg.-Sem. etymology to
be valid. Zaborski regarded )mn% of EAr. dials. mn5% and Mehri mena% to be the
original root (!), which later underwent a secondarily dissimilation into )ml% due
to the in#uence of Sem. *mil%- “salt”. This theory cannot explain the irreg. Eg. -0
vs. Sem. *-%, nor Ug. ml%.
nb3: W. Leslau (1987, 343) rendered Geez mal%a ~ mall2%a “to do, work”, m2l%
“work” as orig. “to do good work” (salt being the symbol of good deeds). Alterna
tively, he assumed that it should be corrected to *mal0a and refers in general to all
the activities expressed by Geez mal0a “to pluck out”.
nb4: V. Bla&ek (1990, 207) and A.Ju. Militarev (2006 MS, 24, #34.6) related the
hypothetic Sem. *ml% “to be good, nice” with SBrb.: Ayr & EWlm. i-mal “forme
unique”, mol--n “good”, t2-mmul-t “good quality” [Alojaly 1980, 127], which is
more than questionable. In principle, Ayr zero < *% is possible, but Ayr -Ø + Eg.
*-0. Moreover, the SBrb. root derives from AA *m-l “good” [GT], which seems
to be related with Eg. jm3 [Blv.: reg. < *mjl] “angenehm (sein), freundlich” (OK,
Wb I 79) = “(to be) pleasing, kind, gentle” (FD 20)? For further details cf. Eg. mn.t
“happy state of being” (NE, DLE, q.v.).
nb5: The Sem.-Eg. parallel was combined by M. Cohen (1947, 191) and A.Ju.
Militarev (1984, 158, #9) with Mer. mle ~ mlo “good” [Meeks 1973, 12]. Its
genetic connection with Eg. mn0 is excluded, while a borrowing from Eg. is also
impossible due to Eg. -0 vs. Mer. -Ø as well as Eg. -n- vs. Mer. -l-, and also because
of the meaning.
nb6: A.R. Bomhard (1984, 275, #289) af"liated Sem. *ml% “to be good” with IE
*m2/al- > Hitt. malai- “to approve”, Lat. melior “better”.

5. être agréable, 6. être bon, convenable”, t--magne “1. bonne conduite, bon sens,
bonnes manières civilisées, 3. procédure, manière de procéder” [PAM 2003, 527].
nb2: Highly dubious whether the SBrb. root is related to CCh.: BM *m(2)na(gu)
“good” [GT]: Margi mÖnÖg_È [Hfm. in RK 1973, 126: “well”] = minagù, mÖnágù

[Krf.], Wamdiu mina0ù [Krf.], Hildi minag$ [Krf.] (Ch.: Kraft 1981, #293), where
*-gu was not part of the original root. N. Skinner (1977, 23) derived WMargi mna
from Ch. *mb-n- (!). But a derivation from PCh. *m-n “good” [GT] < AA *m-n ~
*m-y-n “good (or sim.)” [GT] (discussed s.v. Eg. mn.t “happy state of being”, NK,
DLE, q.v.) seems more probable.

(1.1) The root of the D-stem (ullu0u) of Akk. )yl0 has probably nothing to do
with the root of the G stem el10u “streuen, bestreuen” [AHW 197]. (1.2) Akk.

Eg. wn0. (3) The most convincing etymology for Eg. wn0 was found by E. Zyhlarz

D'49I (name of the Ammonite god Molek), cf. CED 81. The coincidence of the
Dem. spelling with -4 may have been in#uenced by Dem. ml4 “to "ght, battle” as
suggested by M. Smith (1978, 360). Nevertheless, W. Spiegelberg (KHW 58), followed
by W. Westendorf (KHW 91), explained Dem. ml4 > (B) moloc “planet Mars”
from the lit. mng. “Krieger (?)” (Spg.). Moreover, W. Vycichl (DELC 111) surmised
in the (B) orthography with -c an in#uence of Gk. D'49I, while he too derived the
expected (B) *malwJ < *mall34 “guerrier” from Dem. ml4 “Streit, Kampf ”.
! Origin debated. Most convincing is solution no. 2. " 1. GB 383 and W. Spiegelberg (KHW 58) treated it as a borrowing from Hbr. mil%3m3 “Kampf ” [GB], which originates from Hbr. l%m (below). " 2. G. Fecht (quoted in KHW 518) explained the Cpt. word as the 2nd inf. of Cpt. (SL) moulH “zusammenfügen” via a hypothetic secondary sense *”anbinden (mit jmdm.)” on the analogy of (S) mour mN- “mit jmdm. anbinden, streiten” (KHW 99). " 3. W. Vycichl (DELC 111) and J. ,erný (CED 81), in turn, equated Dem. ml4 directly with Hbr. l%m qal “kämpfen” [GB] = “to "ght” [KB 474] with met., cf. also Ar. la%ama I “7. tuer qqn.” [BK II 977] = III “combattre avec”, V “subir la dilaniation, être haché (par le bourreau) à coups de sabre”, VIII & X “hacher à coups de sabre (bourreau)” [Dozy II 521] = VI “to "ght” [KB, not in BK II 977!] = VI “handgemein werden (to come to blows)”, VIII “angezettelt werden, sich entzünden (vom Krieg, Streit usw.)” [WKAS II 345–6],
*ml$ 317



which is only possible on the basis of genetic relationship (not via borrowing). The origin of this Sem. root is highly debated.
nb1: Traditionally (cf. GB 383, KB 526; WKAS II 345), it has been explained
from Sem. *l%m “to join” via the basic mng. “to be pressed together” > “to come
to blows”.
nb2: W. Vycichl (DELC 111) compared also Ar. la0ama “1. couper, 2. frapper qqn.
sur le visage” [BK II 981], which, in the light of Ar. l%m, is out of question.
nb3: Instead of assuming in it a "g. sense of another Sem. root, it might be identi
"ed with the AA cognates appearing in NAgaw: Bilin l3mlãm “feindlich zusam
menwachsen, kämpfen, ringen, raufen miteinander” [Rn.] !!! CCh. *lVmV “1. war,

MS, 10, #229] = làm [Krf.] = l¢m [Lnh./Stl.]. Lit.: Rn. 1887, 256–7 (Bilin-Sem.);
HSED #1702 & Stl. 2005, 88, §285 (CCh.-Sem.). L. Reinisch (l.c.) derived the
Bilin word from an unattested basic mng. *“in einander verschlungen, verwickelt
sein” comparing also Bilin l3m-r “in Empfang nehmen”, laham “zusammenkleben,
-leimen”. Improbable.
" 4. GT: hypothetically, we might alternatively derive it from AA *ml-% “war” [GT] to be deduced on the basis of its comparison with WCh.: Glm. màalá “war” [Alio 1988 MS] ! (?) Bubure m+r, [-r- < *-l-?] “war” [Haruna 1992 MS, #B030]. Here too, a palatalization of *-% > LEg. -4 would have have to be assumed.

Grapow (1914, 13) and Lacau 1970, 150, #406) assumed in LEg. *mns.t an m- pre"x form deriving from Eg. jns.t “unterer Teil des Beines: Unterschenkel samt Fuß” (OK, Wb I 99, 18–20) = shin, shank, calf of leg” (FD 24).

nb2: Eg. jns.t cannot be related with Ar. nis«-at- “wrist” as suggested by A.G. Belova
(1989, 11), which derives from Ar. nis«-at- “girth, strap, belt”. Besides, Eg. j- vs.
Ar. -« are irregular.
" 2. A.B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 309) and V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 170) equated it mistakenly with LECu.: Somali ma‰ín-ti (sg.), pl. má‰in-o ~ mán‰-o “Fuß von Tieren” [Rn. 1902, 289, 444], Oromo man‰í “Fuß” [Rn.] = “&!(%52) (ankle)” [Dlg.] !

nb: These Cu. forms historically go back to ECu. *magin-/*migin- “foot” [Sasse
1979, 54], therefore the PCu. etymon *mAn!q-(An)- “foot” suggested by Dolgopol’skij
(l.c.) has no bases.

“claim on a debt”, mašš3"3 “secured loan” and Ar. nas5"-at- “sale
on credit”. This Sem. etymology was excluded by Woodhouse (2003, 279, #166). " 2. J. F. Quack’s (1996, 509) dubious suggestion (“könnte mit der geographischen Bezeichnung mnws für Kreta zusammenhängen”, i.e., zš mns “wäre dann ein Schreiber, der Kretisch kann”) was rightly declined by Woodhouse (l.c.): “Quack’s interpretation . . . is as good as anything offered by Hoch”.

both equally -s-.
! A de"nite etymology is impossible at the moment because of the uncertain origin of the NK sibilant (-s-/-z-) and also because of the ambiguous basic meaning of the underlying verbal root.

C. T. Hodge (p.c. on 4 September 1994) had a similar comment on Eg. mns3: “The mn- of mns3 I would analyze as two pre!xes, m- and n-, as in mnqb, etc. . . .”
mns – mns3 321



" 2. Alternatively, H. Kees (1922, 111) assumed an eventual etymological connection with OK mnz3 “Krugname” (PT32b, above), which “eine passende Etymologie bildet” provided the XVIII ex. mnz3 preserves the oldest spelling, although “möglich ist aber eine falsche Etymologie in dieser Schreibung” (i.e., in that of mnz3 at Deir el-Bahari). In this case, the hypothetic Eg. *nz3 “to ejaculate” would be the perfect match of Ar. nzl: cf. esp. IV “7. avoir une éjaculation du sperme (se dit d’un mâle)”, V “2. donner du lait (se dit d’une chamelle)”, nuzl“4. sperme que le mâle laisse échapper”, nazal- “2. pluie” [BK II 1240] = nzl IV “éjaculer” [Fagnan 1923, 171], which would imply an ultimate relationship with Eg. mnz3 “Krug” (OK, Wb, above) < *nz3 “to pour out” ~ Sem. *nzl “to #ow down” [GT] (Sem.: GB 494; Lsl. 1987, 411) < AA *n-„-l “to #ow, pour (?)” [GT]. " 3. J. Breasted (1930, 330) rightly ruled out an etymological relevance of the idiom jw=f mn z3.w “it remains stationary” explaining mns3 in Pap. E. Smith 10:20–21: “It would seem highly improbable that . . . mn ‘remain’ and s"w ‘protect’ . . . should have any etymological connection with mnT"
‘emissio’. The commentator has either been misled by the simple paranomasia, or found it too attractive to be resisted”.
" 4. W. Westendorf (1962 GMT, 11, §22.c.3) supposed in Med. mns3 vs. nms.w “Erguß” the very same word with met. Very dubious. Anyhow, mns3 cannot be derived from *mns. " 5. C. T. Hodge (kind p.c. on 4 September 1994) was disposed to analyze “the mn- of mns3 . . . as two pre!xes, m- and n-, as in mnqb, etc. . . . Due to its specialized nature, mns3 is not easily etymologized. In looking for possible cognates, I came upon Ar. wsl V ‘to curry favor’. Not a certainty but to be kept in mind”.
" 6. GT: if the underlying Eg. root was *ns3, cf. alternatively Ar. nasala IV “1. engendrer ou enfanter, donner naissance à un foetus”, VI “se multiplier par une génération successive (se dit des hommes, des animaux)” [BK II 1252].

ited mixed marriage” [KB] usually explained from Sem. *m3r “to decay, rot” [KB

explained the ES root in question from ES *mnzr “to waste money, be spendthrift”,

J. ,erný (CED 85), and C. Peust (1999, 118) derived the Dem.-Cpt. root from Eg.
mn0 “mit dem Meißel arbeiten” (OK, Wb, above), which they distinguished from

Guglielmi (1994, 113) explained the name of the jar as “die Vollendete” or “die Vollenderin” " 3. B. Mathieu (l.c.) derived the underlying root *mnq from a contraction of Eg. *m (pre"x) + (%)nq.t “beer”. Unacceptable. Eg. %- does not disappear after the m- pre"x. " 4. GT: since the basic word for “beer” in Eg. was %nq.t, we may suppose Eg. mnq.t to have signi"ed primarily a sort of jar (having only a secondary association with beer), which may be perhaps related with NAgaw: Bilin mä—=-a “pot of clay”, mä—=2= “pot of clay” [LT 1997, 510]. " 5. GT: a connection with Ar. mlq V “couler (eau qui s’écoule ou stagne sur un sol uni)”, malaq-at- “bourbier, fonds marécageux et non-cultivés” [Fagnan 1923, 165] seems less probable.
mnq “jem. belohnen mit (m) etwas” (XIX.-LP, Wb II 90, 3) = “3. belohnen mit” (GHWb 342).
nb: Cf. also mnq “(mit Obj. und n der Person) jemandem etwas vergelten, etwas
gewähren” (XIX.-LP, Wb II 90, 1–2) usually (Wb, DELC 116, GHWb) explained
from mnq “vollenden” (q.v.).
! GT: cognate with ES: Geez manqaqa “to distribute, hand out, give out” [Lsl. 1987, 351], which stands isolated in Sem.
mnq (vessel det.) “als Bez. für Milch” (GR, Wb II 90, 12) = “Milch” (Vcl. 1988, 489) = “Bez. der Milch” (Guglielmi 1994, 127, n. 10 with lit.) = “milk” (PL 437). ! Etymology disputed. Most promising seems #2. " 1. G. Fecht (1955, 295) derived it from Eg. nq.wt “Feuchtigkeit” (Med. hapax: Pap. E. Smith 21:18, Wb II 343, 17) = “moisture” (Breasted 1930, 497), which he eventually af"liated with Eg. snq “to suckle” and Sem. *yn= “to suck”. Untenable.
nb: Fecht confused two distinct AA roots: (1) Eg. nq.wt is akin to GR nqq “water”
(Osing 1998, 91), which may be cognate either with ECu.: Yaaku nRqRi “river”

G. Conti (1978, 27, fn. 2).
nb3: W.A. Ward (1972, 22) identi"ed the simplex of the caus. Eg. snq incorrectly

nb3: J. Vergote (1950, 291) views that Eg. ndfdf has hardly anything to do with (B)
eltoF “ausspeien” (contra Spg. 1919–20, 18–19, §1; CED 34; Stz. 1994, 198).
nb4: The Eg.-Sem. root clearly originates from an onomatopoetic biconsonantal
AA *9-f, cf. Eg. dfdf “to drip” (PT 133, AEPT 40, FD 312), dfdf.t “Tropfen” (XX.,
Wb V 448, 6). Eg. *df is akin to Sem. biconsonantal *9p “to drop, leak” [Zbr.],
which has been retained with diverse root extensions: (1) Sem. *9p9p: PBHbr. 9ip91p
“tröpfeln, tropfenweise fallen” [Levy 1924 II 178] = “to drip, drop” [Zbr.] !! Tigre
9äf9äfa “alternative de pluie et de beau temps” [Lsl. 1987, 587] = 9if9if “light rain”
[Zbr.]. (2) Sem. *9pp: PBHbr. 9pp “das Maß vollmachen (eine volle Schale)” [Levy
1924 II 182] = “to #oat, drip” [Zbr.] ! Ar. 9ff IV “4. remplir entièrement (un vase,
la mesure)” [BK II 87] = 9ff “to raise”, cf. 9aff-3n- “"lled to brim” [Zbr.]. (3) Sem.
*9wp: PBHbr. 9wp “1. strömen, #ießen, 2. überschwemmt werden, 3. aufsteigen,
in die höhe kommen” [Levy 1924 II 147] = “to #oat” [Zbr.], Syr. 9wp “to #oat,
over#ow, #ood, swim” [Zbr.] ! Ar. 9wf “to over#ow”, 9$f-3n- “#ood, deluge” [Zbr.].
(4) Sem. *9pw: Ar. 9fw “1. surnager à la surface de l’eau” [BK II 90] = “to #oat on
water” [Zbr.]. (5) Sem. *š9p: Hbr. š9p qal “1. to #ood over, 2. gush, pour down”,
nifal “1. to be rinsed, 2. be overwhelmed, #ooded away” [KB 1475] = “to wash off,
leak, over#ow” [Zbr.], JAram (Targum) š9p “sich ergießen, insbes. überströmen, fort-,
abspülen” [Levy 1924 IV 542] = “to over#ow” [Zbr.] ! Ar. s9f “to rinse off ” [KB] =
“'9!&)'23-)*.” [Blv.], cf. also Ar. š9f “to wash” [Freytag] = “rincer, laver” [Dozy I
759b] = “to rinse (out, off)” [KB]. For the Sem. bicons. comparison cf. Dlg. 1966,
85, #8.12; Ward 1968, 70–72; Zbr. 1971, #268; Blv. 1989, 12; 1993, 33, #8.
nb5: Since Sem. *9 regularly corresponds to both Eg. t and d, Sem. *n9p and *š9p
are equally comparable with Eg. ntf “begießen, benetzen” (OK, Wb II 356, 6–8)
and stf “vom sorgsamen Abgießen einer Flüßigkeit (bei der Arzneibereitung)” (Med.,

mndm “Korb für Früchte o.ä., auch bildlich gebraucht” (Lit. MK, NK, Wb II 93, 16–17) = “Art Korb oder Schale” (V.: Abusir 3x, Kaplony 1972, 212) = “basket for fruit (its lid was nqr)” (Lit. MK, XVIII., Janssen 1975, 147, §17) = “corbeille” (PK 1976, 369, 371–4) = “tamis (à farine), corbeille” (CT VI 283s, AL 77.1758) = “basket” (DCT 170) = “un tamis ou une corbeille à farine” (Aufrère 2003, 25) = “ein Korb” (ÄWb I 538).
342 mndm



nb1: Its oldest form is mndm (with -d-) as revealed by the Abusir papyri (in lists
of vessels). Therefore, the later (MK, NK) wtg. mn3m is apparently based on a
pseudo-etymology.
nb2: Written as mn( j) in Ostr. Torino 57068 vs. 2 & 57088 rt. 1:3 (AL 78.1763). The
connection with Eg. mnd “une mesure pour le grain” (XVIII. hapax, AL 78.1759)
> (?) Cpt. (S) mn«, (B) ment (m) “measure of grain” (CD 176a), suggested by
J. Osing (1978, 189), is uncertain.
! Apparently an m- pre"x nomen instr. as suggested by H. Grapow (1914, 25), but the root *ndm has not been identi"ed.
nb: With regard to the Abusir evidence for original -d-, one cannot agree with
H. Goedicke (1998, 120) who suggests that mndm “might be better understood as a descrip
tive mn-ndm ‘the sweet (good) shall remain’, denoting a separating sieve”.
mndt (GW) “Kostbarkeiten o.ä. (eines Libyerfürsten)” (XIX. Wb II 92, 10) = “equipment, ornament” (DLE II 224) = “Ausrüstung” (KRI IV 6:9, Helck l.c.; GHWb 343) = “equipment” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 90 index) = “tax, gifts, tribute (?)” (Hoch 1994, 131, §170).
nb: Written in GW: ma-n-da-tá (Helck, Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey) = ma4-n-da-ta:
*mandatta (Hoch).
! Borrowed from Sem., but the source is disputed: " 1. W. Helck (1962, 560, #93; 1971, 513, #93), followed by J. Hoch (1994, 131, §170), explained it from Akk. mad(d)attu ~ mandattu “Abgabe” [AHW 572] > Hbr. *midd3 “tribute, tax, payment” [KB 548]. " 2. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 16–17, §1.2.2.1) alternatively af"liated it with Sem. *mdd > Hbr. *mad “gown, robe” and midd3 “1. measured length, 2. measure(ment)” [KB 546–7].
mn& “Brust” (OK, Wb II 92–93) = “breast” (FD 110) = “breast, nipple” (Walker 1996, 269) > Dem.mnŸ “breasts” (CED 86, not in DG) > Cpt. (B) !not, dual !noT, emnoT “breast” (CD 176) = “Brust(warze)” (Sethe & Grd. 1910, 43; Till 1955, 330, §34; KHW 96).
nb: The var. bnd.t may be due to a contamination with bn.tj “die beiden weiblichen
Brustwarzen, Brüste” (Med., Wb I 457), cf. Piehl 1890, 47; Grd. 1904, 135. Sur
prisngly, L. Keimer (1984, 40, n. 9) assumed a shift bnd.t > (!) mnd.t (on the analogy
of PT n%b.t > XIX.-GR n%m.t “Knospe des Lotus”), which is impossible.
! Hence (?): (1) mn3 “altar (of Re)” (CT VI 354c, AECT II 275; DCT 170). (2) mn3j “la panse (d’un récipient)” (AL 77.1755) = “Bauch eines Gefäßes” (GHWb 344).
nb1: The latter occurs in fact in the epithet of the brazier wr-mn3j (< *mn3.wj?)
“great-breasted” (CT VI 9a, AECT II 108) = “mit großen Brüsten (vom Feuer
becken)” (Bidoli 1976, 79, n. f ) explained by D. Bidoli (l.c.) with the coincidence
of the form of the brazier and breast: “Das charakteristische Pro!l des Backens . . ., wie es
als Deutzeichen zu «& in Pyr. 558a angegeben ist, rechtfertigt das Beiwort ‘groß an Brüsten’, das
wir am besten mit ‘dickbäuchig’ im Deutschen übertragen würden. Die ‘Brüste’ im Dual . . . gehen
mndt – mn! 343



auf die zwei . . . niedrigen Füße zurück, die sich mit den Zitzen der Brüste vergleichen ließen”.
Since the epithet of brazier occurs already in PT 1961a as wr-mn3=f “the great
breasted one” (AEPT 284) = “Groß-ist-seine-Brust (die vergöttliche Personi"kation
des Feuerbeckens)” (Bidoli l.c.), Meeks’ CT mn3j (sic, with -j) “panse” as such has
to be considered a ghot-word.
nb2: D. Meeks (1977, 81, fn. 1; AL l.c.) derived CT mn3j from OK mn3.t “point
de fusion du métal” (q.v.), which, however, hardly represents the same root.
! Etymology disputable. " 1. Usually equated with Ar. mala6a (impf. ya-mlu6-u) I “saisir avec le bout des lèvres le sein de sa mère (se dit d’un enfant qui se met à téter)”, mali6a I “1. id., 2. sucer et ensuite mâcher une datte sauvage, 3. perdre son lait, ne plus en avoir (se dit d’une chamelle)”, IV “allaiter (enfant)”, VIII “sucer (le lait), tirer tout le lait à force de sucer” [BK II 1143] = mala6a “to suck (at) the breast of his mother (child)” [Möller; Ember] = “lutschen” [Clc.] = “se mettre à téter” [Chn.], which is akin to PBHbr. & JAram. mlg “eig. melken, dem Tiere die Milch entziehen” [Levy 1924 III 123] !! Amh. mällägä “to suck(le) (baby)”, mäläggägä “to suck dry, suckle vigorously”, cf. also moläggägä “to lick the hands clean with one’s tongue” [Kane 1990, 161–2] = mlg D “to suck strongly” [MM] (Sem.: MM 1983, 247) !!! LECu.: Afar muluke ~ mulke [irreg. -k-] “to be satis"ed with milk”, caus. muluk-use [PH 1985, 171], cf. perhaps Orm.-Orma mírga [-rg- < *-lg-?] “to yield milk, produce milk in abundance” [Strm. 1987, 368; 1995, 209; 2001, 56]. The Ar.-Eg. comparison was rightly queried by I. M. Diakonoff and L. E. Kogan (1995 MS, #1815; 1996, 34–35, #1815) as “not so evident” with regard to Cpt. (B) -n-, although they did not exclude “some assimilation processes”.

nb1: W. F. Albright (1918, 92, fn. 4) af"liated Eg.-Ar. *mlg with Akk. mul$gu ren
dered as “nursing fee”. Cf. Akk. mul$gu ~ mul5gu “eine Art Mitgift”, mul$g$tu
“Grundstück” [AHW 671], Ug. mlg (vars. mlk ~ mlk-t ~ ml3) “dowry, gift” [Watson
1995, 538], PBHbr. m2l$g “(eig. das Melken), nur übertragen: Nutznießung, insbes.
Güter, welche die Frau in die Ehe mitbringt, und die als ihr Eigentum verbleiben
sollen” [Levy 1924 III 123]. Note that W. G. E. Watson (1995, 538) assumed in
these forms a Wanderwort of Hurr. origin.
nb2: A var. root to Ar. ml6 is present in Ar. malaqa I “4. téter sa mère (un petit)”
[BK II 1150] (cf. also MM 1983, 162). C. Brockelmann (1907 I, 268–9), followed
by A. Zaborski (1991, 1687) treated Ar. lama6a I “manger qqch. avec le bout des
lèvres”, V “2. goûter, déguster légèrement un mets ou une boisson” [BK II 1023]
= “an der Brust saugen” (sic) [Brk.] as a metathetic variation of )ml6. Uncertain.
H. Möller (1911, 163–4) assumed Ar. ml6 to be eventually cognate with Ar. mala%a
“to suckle, give suck for (of woman)”, mry: mar3 “ubera strinxit”, marada “to
mumble the breast”, mara2a “to suck (breast)”, mara)a “pressit digitis”, which

is phonologically excluded. S. S. Majzel’ & A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 247), in turn,
combined Ar. ml6 with Hbr. gml qal “to wean”[KB 197], which is semantically
unconvincing. Note that Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 204, #1800) derived Ar. ml6 from
PSem. *ml- (sic) “to suck”. G. Takács (1998, 143, #6) did not exclude a bicons.
origin of AA *m-l-g.
nb3: A. B. Dolgopolsky (1968, 102; 1998, 28, §19; Blz. 1990, 208, #291) errone
ously compared Ar. ml6 with LECu.: PSam *m3l- “to milk”. Rejected already by
D. Appleyard (1999, 308–9, §19) and G. Takács (1999, 48).
" 2. Already H. Grapow (1914, 4) and P. Lacau (1970, 71, #178) has ingeniously surmised (without any extra-Eg. evidence) that Eg. mn3 may be a nomen loci or instrumenti (pre"x m-) of an unattested Eg. *wn3 “to suckle (allaiter)”. As pointed out by G. Takács (1997, 232, #22; 1998, 143, #6; 1999, 48; 2004, 60, #350), whose suggestion is supported by D.

sop up, slop, slurp” [Ehret 1980, 212]. Improbable both phonologically and semanti
cally (there is signi"cant difference between SCu. *-k + POromoid *-g, and SCu.
*-i- + POromoid *-$-). POromoid *l$g- can be better explained from ECu. *n$g-.
For Sqt. Ggg, in turn, cf. rather Ar. (Hadramaut) sa6a«a “couler” [Lsl.].
nb5: W. M. Müller (1903, 79) and M. Lamberti (1988, 61 etc.) combined the Cu.
root with NAgaw: Bilin näb- “to suck” with the labialization of *-gw, but this shift
is not proven for Bilin. M. Lamberti (1993, 365–7; LS 1997, 481–2) suggested
further unconvincing parallels, e.g. Sns. nibbà “heart” (along with other re#exes of
Cu.-Om. *l-b ~ *n-b “breast, heart”), Saho na0ar “die ganze Brust”, NOm. *na"
“child”, LECu. *n3g- vs. *mi/e"- “child”. Similarly, one can hardly agree with the
equation of Cu. *nagw-/*n$g- “to suck” vs. Som.-Baiso *na"as- “female breast”
proposed in HL 1988, 133–4.
nb6: Whether Afar nak- “to drink milk” [Black] = nake “to drink milk” [PH 1985,
174] is ultimately related with LECu. *n$g- “suck” is dubious.
nb7: O. V. Stolbova (2005, 60, #2.2) combined LECu. *n$g- ~ *l$g- “to suck”
with Ch. *lig- “to lap, lick”, which, however, certainly represents a distinct AA root,
namely *l-k ~ *l-= “to lick” [GT].
nb8: Ch. Ehret (1995, 317, #613) erroneously equated Cu. *"a/ungw- “breast” with
PSem. *ng- (sic) “to seep, ooze” and Eg. ngsgs “to over#ow” (although the underly
ing root was *gs, cf. Conti 1980, 65) < AA *-nugw- “to seep”.

nb: The rendering “globe oculaire” is somewhat dubious in the light of Eg. bnr
“ball of eye” (NK, CED 22; DLE I 156) < OK b33 (cf. EDE II 232). Eg. mn3j,

thought of a borrowing either from ES or Oromo, while G. Hudson (1989, 85)
pondered a connection with HECu. *g3nge “molars” [Hds.]. However, *mang3g

! Etymology very much disputed: " 1. In Egyptian philology, traditionally explained as a frozen nisba compound jmj-r literally meaning “celui qui est dans la bouche (des individus qui lui sont subordonnés” (Piehl) = “im Munde Be"ndliches” (Behnk) = “was im Munde ist, der welcher etw. zu befehlen hat” (Wb) = “im Munde von, Mundinhalt (sic)” (Sethe) = “he who is in the mouth (i.e., of his subordinates)” (Grd.) = “das, was im Munde ist” (Helck) = “in dessem Mund (die Befehlsgewalt liegt)” (Lange) = “der, in dem/welchem der Ausspruch (r) ist” (Fecht) = “darin be"ndlich ist der Ausspruch” (Westendorf ) = “1. der im Munde ist (seiner Untertanen), or 2. der, in dem der Spruch ist bzw. der, den Spruch hat” (Allam) = “he in whom speech is” (Fischer) = “der sich im Mund be"ndet” or “der, in dem sich der Spruch be"ndet”
354 mr



(Buchberger) = “einer, der der Mund ist” (Gdk.) in view of (1) the writing jmj-r (Wb I 74, 13) attested from the beginning of Dyn. VI (Edel 1956, 8, §8, perhaps already Dyn. II, cf. Allam 1987, 1 & fn. 2 after IÄF III, t. 126, "g. 755 & IÄF II 849, n. 961), which was, however, ignored by H.-G. Fischer (1985, 44–45) who dated this wtg. from the early MK; (2) the fem. form jmj.t-r (3x OK, 1x MK, Grd. 1955, 122), and (3) its pl. jmj.w-r (1x, early MK stela, Kairo 20465, Lange 1905, 142), as well as (4) the abbreviation with the “tongue” hrgl. (from the MK) suggesting a pun “what is in the mouth”, i.e., “tongue”. This etymology is presumably false due to the anomaly of Cpt. (S) *la-, *le-, *elo- vs. (S) ro “mouth”.
lit.: Piehl, RT 1, 1870, 133, n. 3 (later, in PSBA 14, 487, he abandoned this
hypothesis); Grd. in ZÄS 40, 1902–3, 142–4 (cf. also ZÄS 70, 1954, 76f.); Lange

Buchberger 1993, 628; Gdk. 1998, 101–2.
nb1: W. Vycichl (DELC 93–94) correctly maintained that “l’expression n’a pas de rapport
avec le mot r3 ‘bouche’ = ro (SB)”, although he also accepted that “il s’agit certainement
de jmj-l3 (sic) ‘qui est dans le . . .’ ”, in which “le sens de l3w n’est pas connu, mais on peut
supposer qu’il sagissait primitivement d’un bâtiment particulier où le chef exerçait ses fonctions”.
Baseless. W. Westendorf (1989, 110–1): “die Übersetzung ‘der im Munde ist’ . . . beweist
nichts hinsichtlich der Bedeutung . . .”. Also H. Goedicke (1998, 102) found this rendering
to be “eine Einstellung . . ., für die kein Nachweis erstellt werden kann”.
nb2: For rendering jmj-r as the inverted use of nisba see Erman 1928, §231b; ZÄS
52, 1915, 107f.; Grif"ths, JEA 28, 1942, 66f.; Fecht 1960, §70, fn. 126 & §259, fn.

icke 1998, 101–2. G. Fecht (1960, 134–5, fn. 399) took the apparent Endbetonung of
*( j'mej)-lå3 > OCpt. lo as a proof for an umgekehrte Nisbe, i.e., Nominalsatzkompositum
meaning “der, auf den zutrifft: das Innere ist der Ausspruch” > “der, in dem der
Ausspruch ist” (instead of an älteres Kompositum *j'm°j-l-3 “der in r3 Be"ndliche”).
The rendering of jmj-r as inverted nisbe has been "rmly disproved by K. Jansen
Winkeln (1993, 9–10), cf. also Schenkel, CdE 41 (1966), 55–57.
nb3: The anomaly of Cpt. (S) l- vs. r- has not been satisfactorily explained. F. L.
Grif"th (PSBA 21, 1899, 272) pondered an assimilation of Cpt. (S) *la- to the
homophonous form of the part.conj. pre"x (SLB) la- “possessing, endued with”
(CD 135a) = “Zugehörig” (KHW 74) “due to false analogy”. A. H. Gardiner (1902–3,
144), in turn: “From rw to lw is no dif!cult step: perhaps the change from r to l is due to the
in"uence of the lost element jmj . . .”. But as W. Helck (1954, 76–77) rightly stressed, for
the wtg. with the tongue hrgl. “vielleicht hat eine Rolle gespielt, daß las auch *l- hatte
wie mr > le-vwne, während bei jmj-r3 müßte man *r- (ro) voraussetzen”.
nb4: H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (1992, 40–43, §III) thinks to have found the clue for the
reading and rendering of jmj-r in jmj.t-r “als Name von Geräten” (CT, Wb I 74,
14) = “eine bestimmte Art von Stab oder Stock” (Fischer-Elfert after K. J. Seyfried
1977, 65–70), which he understood as a inverted nisba, lit. “das, in dem sich der
Ausspruch be"ndet (als eine materielle Manifestation des ‘Wortes’)”. He regarded
both jmj.t-r and mdw as “Würdezeichen des Beamten: Mund, Wort, Ausspruch”,
which signify the “Potenz des Wortes, des befehlenden, autoritätsheißenden Aus
spruches” as evidenced i.a. by the Sign Pap. of Tanis, where mdw “Stab” is explained
with “eine aufschlußreiche Glosse” ns n mdww “sprechende Zunge” (cf. Grif"th 1889,
20, pl. VI, II.A.3, l. 4). Note that A. Hassan (cf. Fischer-Elfert 1992, 41, fn. 37) and
E. Edel (AÄG §347.1) render jmj.t-r as “Stab, der sich im Tore be"ndet”.
mr 355



" 2. W. Helck (1954, 76–77) rightly queried the correctness of this Volksetymologie. He considered the wtg. with “tongue” hrgl. as a result of secondary re-interpretation of mr as ( j)m( j)-r “what is in the mouth” (i.e., “tongue”) due to homophony taking place by the MK (acc. to Edel 1956, 8, §8 by the late OK) on the analogy of titles like jmj-0nt and jmj-jz. He proposed an etymological connection of mr with a hypothetic OK *mr.tj “two eyes” (attested from BD, below) and eventually with Eg. m33 (act. *mll or *mrr?) “to see” (above) as suggested by W. Vycichl (1951, 72). E. Edel (1956, 9, fn. 1) did not rule out an ultimate etymological connection to Cpt. (S) bal “eye” either (incorrect, cf. EDE II 256). Rejected by A. H. Gardiner (1955, 121–2: “questionable, . . . mere groundless speculation”) as well as by H. G. Fischer (1985, 44–45).
nb: Helck found Dyn. III evidence (on the block from Akhti-Aa’s tomb, Berlin
15302/3) for mr being the original consonant sequence: in the title mr k3.t nb.t
nsw “Vorsteher aller Arbeiten des Königs”, it was written with m + two eyes. A. H.
Gardiner (1955, 121) queried this “not unplausible suggestion”, since “the assumed evapora
tion of the fem. dual ending presents an insuperable obstacle”, whence he considered the ex.
from Dyn. III a “sportively written equivalent” for mr, to be read jmj-jr.tj (read jmj-jr.tj also
by P. Kaplony, IÄF I 658 & III, "g. 755 as). E. Edel (1956, 9, §8, fn. 2) regarded “die
erwähnte bizarre Schreibung aus der 3. Dyn. . . . eher als kryptographische Spielerei . . . (Anspielung
auf den Titel jmj-jrtj . . .?)”, while M. Z. Allam (1987, cf. AEB 87.0228) read it as m3(w)
“overseer (Beaufsichtiger)” (he assumed the underlying Eg. m33 “beaufsichtigen” to
have survived in Eg. Ar. m3"a “etwas anstarren, scharf beobachten”). In the view
of H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (1992, 40 & fn. 28), in turn, in this early ex. “geht es um einen
eigenständigen Titel”, which he (pace Allam) read m3w.
" 3. Already F. Behnk (1927, 80) has observed (with reservations) the closeness of Eg. mr to Sem. *"mr “1. to see, 2. show, say, 3. order”
[GT], which is eventually cognate with Eg. m33 “to see” (q.v.). A cognacy with Eg. mr is improbable in view of Cpt. (S) l-.

*mr (hardly *m%r) word deduced from the phon. value mr of the hrgl. U23 depicting a “pointed instrument with wooden handle of peculiar shape (showing that it is to be worked by hand) of rushes (?) bound together: apparently a chisel or borer to be worked by hand, connected with drilling or piercing (not struck with the hammer)” (Grif"th 1898, 49) = “chisel (?)” (Ember 1917, 21; EG 1927, 503) = “Werkzeug (die älteste Form): zweifellos ein Meißel, bestehend aus dem Handgriff in Gestalt eines Kegelstumpfes und einer verschieden breiten, zugespitzten, angebundenen oder eingelassenen Klinge; hieraus die Form des AR & MR: ein gut in der Hand liegender Griff in der Form eines umgekehrten Kelches, der sich nach der Klinge hin so verbreitert, daß die Hand nicht abgleiten kann; am freien Endeist eine Scheibe als Schlag#äche so aufgesetzt, daß die Hand unter ihr geschützt liegt; . . . die Klinge, lang, mit geschweiften Rändern, endet in eine rhombische Spitze oder in eine breite Schneide, sie ist in den Griff eingelassen” (Wreszinski 1932, 133–4 after Petrie) = “hand chisel (in the OK with a projection at the front of the handle provided to

nb1: As stressed by W. Wreszinski (l.c.), it is to be distinguished from the hrgl. U23
with the phon. value 3b (the two were confused already in the OK), which originally
depicted “a pin for holding a lock of hair (perhaps the loop was intended for holding
the end of a strand of hair which was to be wound around it)” (Weigall 1911–12,
176, §13) = “eine Haarnadel (aus Elfenbein)” (Wreszinski).
nb2: Not clear if the MK hapax mr.t “mortier” ( Jéquier 1921, 298) = “*Mörser”
(GHWb 347: “Existenz des Wortes nicht gesichert”) represents the same word.
nb3: Often identi"ed with the second element of the PN n«r-mr rendered very
diversely (and rather unconvincingly in most of the cases): (1) “Cleaving Cat"sh”
based on Eg. mr “chisel” (Goldwasser 1992, 68); (2) “wütender Wels (angry cat"sh)”
(Kaplony, Orientalia 34, 1965, 132f.) = “schlimmer Wels (malapterus electricus)”
(Beckerath apud Gdk.), cf. Eg. mr “krank > schlimm” (q.v.); (3) “Der Befehlshaber
unter der mr.w-Mannschaft” < Eg. n«r “Tätigkeit: gackern” (sic!) ~ Eg. Ar. na«ar
“Schrei des Viehes, Gebrüll” (MK, cf. Wb II 209, 7) + Eg. mr.w “mercenaire” < mr
“Hacke” etc. (Moftah 1987, 128), perfectly false; (4) “excellent warrior (of Horus)”
(sic), where mr is read mn0 (Goedicke 1995, 82–83); (5) “Dappled One” based on
reading -mr as s3b (Ray 2003).
nb4: J. F. Quack (2003, 113–6) argued for a phon. value m%r of U23 based on 3
dubious exx.: (1) Eg. mr “pyramid” > Ar. haram- (not clear how this uncertain
etymology might be suggesting to read in fact *m%r); (2) Eg. mr “krank” re#ected
by Dem. mhl (Tebtunis onomasticon) ~ mhr (Pap. Carlsberg 304, 3:5) as well as
CT V 113b (T1C) %mr.t (usually considered an error for mr.t, cf. AECT II 32, spell
397, n. 91: “% in T1C is surely a misreading of original mr . . .”), although its rendering
“Pain” (AECT) is not at all certain (cf. T1Be mr%.tj pointing to a distinct lexeme);
(3) Eg. smr “friend” written s%mr in the Onomasticon of Amenope (Pap. Gole
nischeff 1:14, cf. AEO I 20*, fn. a: -%- is “intrusive and meaningless”), explained with
the Dem. gloss sm%3 in the Tebtunis onomasticon (Osing 1998 I, 172, 178, n. s) as
well as in Dem. Pap. Wien 6319, 1:16.
! Etymology uncertain. " 1. W. Westendorf (1989, 75) derived it from an unattested Eg. *mr “stechen” assuming a connection to Eg. mr “krank” (!) on the analogy of Eg. nq«.wt “stechende Schmerzen” < nq« “ritzen, schneiden”.
Far-fetched, since the we are not dealing here with the very same semantic shift.
" 2. F. L. Grif"th (1898, 49): “being constructed by binding the tool may have received its name” from Eg. mr “to bind”. " 3. A. Ember (1917, 21) and W. F. Albright (1918, 98, fn. 1) equated it with Sem.: Amh. märo “chisel” [Lsl.] = már. “chisel” [Ember, Alb.], which is to be identi"ed with ES: Gurage: Chaha & Ezha & Masqan mwarä, Ennemor & Endegeny & Gyeto & Selti & Wolane märo, Goggot & Soddo märä “chisel” (ES: Lsl. 1979 III, 418). Cognateship uncertain.
nb: As pointed out by W. Leslau (1979 III, 418; 1987, 265), the Amh. word comes
from an ancient var. m2hro ~ m2%ro [Dillmann 1865, 588], while the Gurage words
too are supposed to derive from a nomen instr. *m2-0ra/äw [Praetorius 1879, 157]
of *)0rw, cf. Geez 0aräwä “to pierce, perforate, make a hole, engrave, carve, chisel,
360 *mr



make a sketch, dig (out)” [Lsl.]. This analysis proves that the similarity of Eg. *mr
and ES “chisel” is purely accidental. Note that Geez marawa “to perforate, drill
a hole” [Lsl. 1987, 361] is treated by W. Leslau as a denom. verb deriving from
Amh. märo “chisel”.

nb: Attested in Ug. mll G “to caress, pinch, rub (?)”, mll “waste, scraps (?)” [DUL
558], Hbr. mll qal “(mit den Füßen) scharren” [GB 431] = “to scrape” [KB 594],

nb1: J. F. Quack (2003, 114, §2) tried to rewrite the phon. value of the hrgl. U23
as m%r. One of his arguments was Eg. mr “krank”: (1) glossed with Dem. mhl ~
m%l in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD, Osing 1998, 71, 73, n. ao & 218:
“der Grund der Entstehung des zusätzlichen h bzw. ' ist unklar”); (2) cf. ibidem mr-nsr
“Name des 8. Tores der Unterwelt: Die mit schmerzhafter Feuersglut” glossed with
Dem. m%l-nslj (Osing 1998, 201–3); (3) re#ected by [mh]r in Pap. Carlsberg 304,
3:5; (4) attested in CT V 113b (T1C) as %mr.t usually considered an error for mr.t
(cf. AECT II 32, spell 397, n. 91: “% in T1C is surely a misreading of original mr . . .”),
whose rendering as “Pain” (AECT) is, however, not at all certain (cf. T1Be mr%.
tj pointing to a distinct lexeme). Quack’s GR exx. for a rare interchange of mr- ~
m%- in epithets are even less convincing.
nb2: W. A. Ward (1961, 36, §16) assumed a primary sense “to be strong” appear
ing in Sinuhe B132–4 ( jb nb mr.w n=j “every heart was strong for me”) and
Wenamon 2:67–68 (n3 md.t j.3d.w n=f jw=w mr “the things that were said to
him were strong”), but D. Pardee (1978, 255) rightly rendered these and further
exx. as occurences of a metaphorical use “compassion, distress” deriving from the
basic mng. “sick, displeasing, disagreeable”. P. Kaplony (1965, 142) rendered n«r-mr
as “der wütende Wels” suggesting an early shift of mng. of )mr, which requires
further evidence.
! Hence: mr.t “1. Krankheit, 2. Böses, Schlimmes” (PT, Wb II 96, 6–12) > OCpt. (Pap. BM 10808) mre« “Schlimmes” (Osing 1976,

origin of Sem. *mr¿. It has hardly anything to do with Sem. *mrr “bitter” or Ar.

Similarly false is the idea of H. Möller (1911, 165) who af"liated Sem. *mr¿ on
a bicons. basis e.g. with Ar. mrmr “to become smooth”, mrr “to go (away), pass
(away, on)”, mrd & mr2 “to macerate (a thing in water)”, mrn “to be(come) smooth
with a degree of hardness”.
nb3: A. Drexel (1925, 14) erroneously equated Hbr. mr) “krank sein” with WCh.:
Hausa màrwáá “2. a serious quarrel, angry disputing and arguing, 3. any sudden
dazedness or giddiness” [Brg.] = “2. bickering” [Abr.] misquoted by him as márwaa
“Pein, Angst” (sic), although its basic meaning is quite different: “1. serious tangling
of two or more well-ropes let down simultaneously” [Brg. 1934, 776] = “1. tangling
of several well-ropes” [Abr. 1962, 660].
nb4: H. Möller (1911, 165) combined Sem. bicons. *mr- with IE *m-r- (sic) “zer
reiben, weich sein” (ext. *-k, *-H, *-d, *-X, *-g, *-s) > “sterben” (!). False. A.R.
Bomhard (l.c.) equated Eg. mr and Sem. *mr¿ with IE *mer- “to die”.
" 2. Eg. mr has been compared (often together with Sem. *mr¿ or Ar. mrh) also with Sem. *mrr “to be bitter” [Frz. 1964, 267, #2.39], cf. e.g. Hbr. mrr qal “1. to be bitter, 2. desperate, bewildered”, hi"l “to cause bitterness, grief, embitter etc.” [KB 638] !!

But the semantic connection of “ill” and “bitter” is not evident as rightly noted by C. T. Hodge (1976, 20, fn. 43). Rejected by Th. Schneider (1993, 81).

nb2: F. W. M. Philippi (1875, 88–87) falsely derived Sem. *mrr “bitter sein”, Ar.
mrmr “rinnen, #ießen”, Ar. mrr “1. vorübergehen, 2. binden, fesseln”, Hbr. mr"
“stark, fest, fett, gesund, kräftig sein”, Ar. mrh “krank sein”, Hbr. mrh “widerspenstig
sein”, Sem. *mr¿ “krank sein” etc. from a common bicons. PSem. *mar “streich/fen,
straff/mm sein” (sic). For Sem. *mrr ~ Ar. mrh cf. also Lsl. 1949, 315, #481.
nb3: W. A. Ward (1961, 36, #16; 1980, 357–360) explained both Sem. *mrr “to
be bitter” and Eg. mr “krank sein” from a primary sense “harsh, violent strength”
based on 2 Eg. exx. (above) and Job 13:26 (m2r.r.t “string things”), respectively.
P. Vernus (2000, 187) also de"ned the mng. of the Eg. root as “être piquant, amer,
douloureux” (sic), which is far-fetched. As correctly pointed out by D. Pardee (1978,
256), “there is no trace in Egyptian of a sense ‘strengthen’ . . .”, while, in his view, the seman



mr 365
tic development “bitter” " “strong” in the Sem. exx. (below) was restricted just to
certain idioms (Pardee 1978, 274–6). B. Margalit (1983, 70), however, defended the
etymologically distinct status of Sem. *mrr “bitter” vs. Sem. *mrr “strong”. L. Kutler
(1984, 111–8) too maintained the shift from “bitter” to “strong” (or vice versa!) in
all the levels of OT Hbr. as well as in Sem. The etymological connection of Sem.
*mrr “bitter” vs. “strong” has been frequaently maintained in Sem. lexicography
(Gordon 1955, 291–2, #1170; Ward l.c.; Dietrich & Loretz & Sanmartín 1973,
119–122; Pardee 1978, 249–288; Masson 1991, 92; KB 638; DUL 577). Note that
the basic sense of the Sem. root was etymologized in BK II 1084 from Ar. mrr X
“3. être tordu avec force, recevoir quelques tours de plus pour être solide (se dit
d’une corde), de là: être ferme, constant” (representing a distinct AA root, cf. Eg.
mr “binden”, q.v.), which É. Masson (1991, 92) extended even to Sem. *mrr “to
be bitter”. Dubious.
nb4: Sem. *mrr “to be strong”, however, seems to represent a distinct AA root, cf.
Akk. mar3ru “i.a. to prevail, be strong” [Kutler 1984, 117 after AHW 613–4; CAD

" 3. H. Holma’s comparison of Eg. mr with Ar. mariha “krank sein (vom Auge)”, marih- “krank (überhaupt)” [Holma] (frequently echoed in the lit.) is also false.

sans éclat (se dit des yeux), marih- “faible, abattu”, murh-at- “blanc pur, couleur
blanche sans aucun mélange” [BK II 1096–7]. Besides, Sem. -h vs. Eg. -Ø do not
correspond unless Ar. -h is a secondary root extension.

" 4. J. Vergote (1945, 136, #9.c.3) and W. Westendorf (1962, 29, §46. c.5) equated Eg. mr with Eg. mn (above) assuming an interchange of r ~ n. " 5. W. Westendorf (1989, 75) af"liated it with Eg. mr “Meißel” (q.v.) deriving both from the Grundbedeutung “stechen”. " 6. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 200) equated Eg. mr mistakenly with re#exes of Ch. *m-(w)-t “to die” [ JI 1994 I, 47] where the shift *-t > -r had taken place.
nb: Cf. e.g. WCh.: Dera mu’- [ Jng.] !! CCh.: Bcm. Œbúrò [Skn.] | Musgu mára

1994 II, 102–3).
" 7. Th. Schneider (1993, 81; 1997, 198, #34) equated Eg. mr with Hbr. "ml qal “sich schlaff senken (von den P#anzen), verwelken”, pulal
“verwelken (von P#anzen), vertrocknen” [GB 48, 430] = “"eberheiß sein” [Snd.] | Ar. mll “gebeugt sein, sich hinschleppen” [GB] = mll “verdrossen, müde sein”, mul3l- “krankhafte Unruhe, Fieberhitze” [Wehr] “heat of fever”. Similarly, Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 202, #1792) combined Eg. mr with ECu.: Dullay: Harso & Dbs. & Glg. mal3l- “1. schwach werden, 2. zusammenbrechen (Mensch), 3. nicht können” [AMS 1980, 174, 212]. Both etymologies are dubious semantically and also because of OCpt. -r.
nb: Ehret (l.c.) compared also Ar. mald- “tendre, délicat (de corps)” [BK II 1146]
= “soft and delicate” [Ehr.].
mr “Pyramide” (OK, Wb II 94, 14–16).
nb1: Part of the hrgl. O24 represents “le rectangle, une base comme représentation
du mur qui enclôt le tombeau (?)” - %!2+"97 (Gilbert 1935, 155–6).
nb2: J. F. Quack (2003, 113–4, §1) reconstructed the phon. value of the hrgl. U23
(chisel, above) partly on the basis of mr “pyramid” which he erroneously read as
m%r purely because of its supposed (albeit disputable) connection with Ar. haram
(below). Unconvincing, since there is no inner Eg. evidence for -%- in this lexeme.
nb3: Whether Gk. /#()217 contains the same word is not certain. The old Greek
popular etymology (/]( “"re” or /#('7 “wheat”) is evidently false. The derivation
from Cpt. pi- + Ar. %arama “to be sacred” (de Sacy) or Cpt. pi- or /]( “"re” +
Gk. «$r-«am$d “"re-column” (Hager) is equally improbable. K. Lang (1923–24,
551–3) and W. Schenkel (1997, 328, fn. 8) assumed a compound re#ecting Cpt.
pi- (“strong” form of the def. article p-), i.e., *pi-mar > via met. *pi-ram (Lange)
= *p-3-mår (Snk.), where Gk. /#- < */&- may have been in#uenced by a Greek
Volksetymologie (/]( or /#('7). J. F. Quack (2003, 114, fn. 6) explained Gk. /#()217
via *p3-hrm < *p3-m%r.
nb4: The same uncertainty pertains to the origin of Ar. haram-, pl. "ahr3m- ~
hir3m- “pyramide de l’Égypte” [BK II 1415], which is explained in the traditional
popular etymology from Ar. harim- “1. très-vieux, décrépit” [BK]. Instead, D. H.
Müller (1876) supposed Ar. haram- to have originally denoted a “tall building”
deriving from Sem. *rwm (cf. the town Haram in Yemen with a famous building



mr 367
erected by the Himyarite kings). K. Lang (l.c.), in turn, saw in it the Hbr. article
ha- + Eg. mr, which is rather anachronistic. Its connection to Hermes, Hermonthis,
Cheremon proposed by S. Fodor & L. Fóti (1976, 166 pace de Sacy) was rightly
declined by J. F. Quack (2003, 114, fn. 6), who, in turn, derived Ar. haram- directly
(!) from Eg. *m%r (!). W. Schenkel (1997, 328, fn. 8): Ar. háram- < (B) *fi-ram
(*phi-rám) reinterpreted as non-Bohairic *p-Hiram with epenthesis of *-h- of the
(B) article. Far-fetched.
! One of the most enigmatic words from an etymological viewpoint. Etymology still unsettled in spite of the abundance of suggestions: " 1. W. F. Albright (1919, 189; 1927, 218), F. von Calice (1936, #631) identi"ed Eg. mr with Ar. "amar-at- (pl. "amar-) “1. petite pierre qui

nb1: W. Spiegelberg (1908, 88–89) interpreted the hrgl. N36 (phon. value mr)
“channel "lled with water” (EG 1927, 479) = “Kanal” (Wb II 96, 13) solely as “ein

nb3: From the same root have been has been explained: (1) mr.w “von Geräten:
Becken o.ä. aus Metall” (LP, Wb II 97, 3–8) = “basins or receptacles of some sort”
(Caminos 1958, 103, §157, n. f ), cf. also Urk. IV 630 with a label to a relief showing

“Anlage” (Amarna, LP, Helck, LÄ II 378; Görg 1976, 29), which is rather dubious
(q.v.). (3) Usually mr.t n.t m3nw “als poet. Bez. der Stätte des Tempels von Medinet
Habu” (XX. hapax, Wb II 98, 7) = “name of the site/location of the mortuary
temple of Ramses III” (Darnell), cf. e.g. Geßler-Löhr 1983, 27, n. 94: “Vielleicht
wurde der Begriff von dem zu führenden Kanal (mr) zunächst auf den gesamten Vorbereich des
Tempelbezirks ausgedehnt und konnte im Laufe der weiteren Entwicklung auch ganz allgemein für
‘Gebiet’ stehen”. Darnell (1994, 37 & 38, fn. 18), however, suggests a rdg. sp3.t n.t

nb: That is, in this case, we should (1) either maintain its ultimate connection with
Eg. *mr “die hölzerne Hacke” (Wb, below), or, (2) as external cognates, cp. Akk.

forms from ES *mrmr “to examine, investigate”.
" 2. H. Abel (1933–34, 304) and E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 172, 174 and 1934–35, 256) equated Eg. mr with PNub. *marti “Bewässerungsgraben, -kanal”, also Mahassi mer1 “Teich, Tümpel”, which, cannot be cognate with Eg. mr only borrowed from it. Cf. also Takács 1998, 156, #15.

Eg. mr and the Ari cognate with SCu. *mur- “to #ow” (its re#exes in Ehret 1980,

an earlier *m-bwr. The three comparanda are, however, to be separated.
nb4: A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 104, fn. 31) connected the Brb. and WCh. forms “land,
"eld” (above) etymologically with PAA *marr- “hoe” [Mlt.] (attested in Sem., Eg.,
ECu., Ch.), which is still open for further research. This similarity is especially
apparent in WCh., where the stem for “farm, "eld” is dif"cult to separate from that
for “to cultivate land” (cf. esp. Mlt. l.c.; Stl. 1987, 233).

nb: P. Behnstedt (l.c.) identi"ed the Yemeni Ar. word with Ar. m3l- “goods, cattle”,
which would probably exclude the comparison with Eg. mr.
" 4. A. Anselin (2000, 80, fn. 6) combined both (!) Eg. mr.t and mrw “bande désertique, marge, frange, lisière” with a number of sematically unconvincing Ar. parallels: mrt “conduire hors de”, mart- “désert sans eau”, mr6 “envoyer un animal pâturer”, mrr “passer” (cf. Ehret 1989, 14).
*mr “als Schriftzeichen: die hölzerne Hacke (nur in der Spätzeit belegt als Name der Hieroglyphe)” (Wb II 98, 11) = “wooden hand-hoe, made of a long bent blade held in place by a cord attached to the handle” (Grif"th 1898, 48) = “une fourche d’arbre naturelle (on aurait perfectionné cet util en le composant de deux pièces assemblées, liées fortement)” (Langlois 1919, 160–1, §1) = “hoe” (EG 1927, 502, U6–7) = “una zappa fatta di due pezzi tenuti fermi da una legatura” (Conti 1978, 55, fn. 2) = “hoe (in the OK with either one or two crosspieces)” (Fischer 1983, 43, U6) = “Hacke (die sich zum P#ug entwickelt hat)” (Moftah 1987, 128, 139, n. 22).
nb: The view that it was a foundation symbol (Nibbi, ASAE 63, 1979, 148f.;
GM 29, 1978, 89f.; Odgon 1981, 63; Wildung 1981, 39f.) has been declined by
W. Barta (1982, 11–16).
! Hence (?): Cpt. (SAL) eme, (B) ame, amh (f ) “hoe (for digging)” (CD 55b; cf. Crum, JEA 8, 1922, 117) = “aratrum, manica aratri” (Langlois 1919, 160–1, §1) = “Hacke, P#ug” (KHW35) = “houe” (Dévaud 1921, 156–8; Muséon 36, 1923, 87, §16) > (?) Gk. S2B “faucille, fauchet” (Boisacq) = “a shovel or mattock” (Crum).
nb1: The etymology of the Cpt. word is disputed. E. Dévaud (1921, 156–8)
explained its supposed etymon *jmj.t not from a masc. *mr, but LEg./GR mrj.t (f )
(Tanis Sign Pap. 18:4, cf. Grif"th & Petrie 1889, pl. 4, p. 18, for its dating for the
Roman period cf. Iversen 1958, 4–6; Meltzer 1970, 193, fn. 1), where he assumed

š3 “pig”, (B) anaiw < Eg. n«j.t “piquet d’amarrage”. E. M. Meltzer (1970, 193),
however, surmised in the GR hapax a later loan-word (source not speci"ed). Simi
larly, J. Vergote (1950, 294) regarded (B) ame, amh to be “peut-être un emprunt au
grec S2B”, which, besides, has an IE background (Boisacq 1916, 53).
nb2: The etymology offered by Langlois (1919, 160–1, §1) for the Cpt. word (derived
from Eg. 3mm.t “"st, poing, la poignée” suggesting a basic sense “mancheron”) is
certainly false.
! From the same root (denom. verb): jmr “houer” (V. hapax, Dévaud 1921, 156–8 after Steindorff ) = “piocher” (Baillet 1905, 214 & fn. 14; 1907, 21). Cf. also the hypothetic (*)mr “hacken” (XVIII., Sethe 1929, 4) = “creuser” (AL 77.1765) = “graben (Kunstwort)” (GHWb 345).
nb1: K. Sethe (l.c.) derived Eg. t3-mrj “Ägypten” (lit. < *“das behackte Land, Kul
turland”) as well as mr “Graben, Kanal” from the same root. Uncertain. R. Moftah
(1987, 128, 139, n. 22) suggested even more improbable Eg. derivatives, e.g., mr.w
“Sklaven” (q.v.).
*mr 375



nb2: Hence may perhaps derive Dem. mr “tombe” in Dem. Pap. Leiden I 384,
18:10 (rejected by Spiegelberg, registered in DG under m%w), for which cf. Malinine
in RdE 14 (1962), 39, n. A4 and Cenival 1984, 224.
! The word is widespread also outside AA as an agricultural Wanderwort, whose ultimate source is dif"cult to determine. Within the AA family, Eg. *mr "nds its closest parallels in several branches, but here too we are probably dealing rather with areal words than cognates (independent interbranch borrowings?): Sem. *mar(r)- “houe, marre” [Chn.] = *marr- “+!*%?)” [Djk.]: Akk. marru “Schaufel, Spaten” [AHW 612] = marru “shovel, spade” [CAD m1, 287], Emar marru “shovel” [Sjöberg 1998, 265, #438] !!

dp: Outside AA, the following parallels have been compared: (1) Sum. (giš/urudu)mar
“houe, marre” [Labat 1976, 141, #307] = “Spaten” [Borger 1978, 125, #307] is
usually treated (e.g. AHW 612) as source for Akk. marru and hence for the further
Sem. re#exes. (2) Lat. marra “Hacke zum Ausjäten des Unkrauts” [LEW II 43] =
“sorte de houe à large tête” [DÉLL 388], borrowed into LGk. 25((9", 25(()
_(3)4!J9" ?&0B(9]" [Hesykhios], hence It. marra, Fr. (region of Orléans) la marre.
Their ultimate source was probably Akk. with the mediation of Aram. (cf. Lewy
1931, 33, fn. 1). (3) Drv. *m1E-i- (only SDrv., CDrv.) “plough(-tail, -handle)” [DED
#5097]. (4) Sino-Tibetan *mra “to plough” [Shafer quoted by Bla&ek & Boisson
1992, 20].
nb1: The source of Eg. *mr is very much debated. W. M. Müller (1909, 107) thought
Eg. *mr to have been borrowed from PSem. *marr-. B. Hrozný (1938, 371; 1938,
437) and E. S. Meltzer (1970, 193–194) supposed in Eg. *mr the proof for a stronger
Sum. in#uence on predynastic Egypt. D. G. Reder (1962, 167–168) rejected the
primary meaning “hoe” of Eg. *mr and its being a Sum. loan. W. A. Ward (1978,
54) Eg. *mr was borrowed indirectly from Sum. mar through Sem. On the other
hand, the Russian linguists (Stl. 1977, 65; 1987, 233; Djk. 1981, 50; Mlt. 1983,
104, fn. 31; 1984, 60, #12; 1985, 1, #1; 1989, 129; 1990, 33; Mlt.-Stl. 1990, 74;
Kvl.-Mlt. 1993, 27, #2; 1994, 2, #2.2; OS 1988, 75; 1989, 135; 1992, 174; HSED
#1738–1739) treat Eg. mr as genetically cognate with the AA parallels.
nb2: The etymological position of the Sum. and Sem. forms is equally disputed. Most
probable seems a borrowing via Sum. > Akk. > Aram. & Ar. etc. (as suggested e.g.
in CAD m1, 287; AHW 612). F. Perles (1905, 382) maintained that the Aram. and
Ar. forms were not borrowed from Lat. or Greek, but represented a “Semitic word ”
stemming eventually from Akk. (since Hbr. lacks it). W. M. Müller (1909, 107) saw
in Late Sum. mar a loan-word borrowed from Akk., while M. Cohen (1947, 191,
#478) derived the Sum. term from Sum. eri “cuivre” (sic), which would exclude
a genetic cognacy of the Eg. and Sem. terms. Recently, the Russian scholars (Djk.
1981, 50; Mlt. 1983, 104, fn. 31; 1984, 60, #12; 1985, 1, #1; 1989, 129; 1990, 33;
Mlt.-Stl. 1990, 74; Kvl.-Mlt. 1993, 27, #2; 1994, 2, #2.2) are, in turn, inclined to
interpret Sum. mar itself too as “a substratum loan” from an unspeci"ed (but not
Sem.) AA substratum supposed to have existed in the Ancient Near East (cf. also
Takács 1998). I. M. Diakonoff (1998, 213, fn. 9) too derived Sum. mar “hoe” from
PSem. *marr- because he considered its AA cognates as genetic. Or vice versa?
nb3: It is also dif"cult to judge whether Akk. (OBab.) mar3ru “durchgraben (?)”
[AHW 608] = “to break a "eld for cultivation”, Dt “to be split (?)”, N “to be
broken” [CAD m1, 268] !! Amh. märämmärä “to dig” & Gurage: Selti mirämärä
“to plow a "eld for the third time” [Lsl.] can belong here in any form as denom.
verbs from *marr- “hoe”. W. Leslau (1979 III, 422) explained the ES forms from
ES *mrmr “to examine, investigate”. I. M. Diakonoff (1998, 213, fn. 9) declined
the reconstruction of AA *mar- “to hoe, work in the "eld” (in HSED #1739) on
the basis of Akk. mar3ru “to hoe, dig up”, which is in fact a denom. verb of marru
“hoe”. Similarly, WCh.*mar- “to hoe” [GT] might be a secondary denom. verb,
whose source (Ch. *mar “cultivated "eld” [Ehr. 1997 MS, 207, #1808]), if correct,
indicates a distinct origin.
nb4: In I. M. Diakonoff’s (1998, 212, fn. 6) view, the comparison of Hbr. mar II
“Tropfen” [GB 457] = “speck” [KB] with ECh.: Smr. maari “rain” (apud HSED)
is false, since the misquoted Hbr. hapax (Isa. 40:15) was in fact a deverbal noun
from Hbr. *mrr “to dig” (sic).
nb5: A.Ju. Militarev (1987 MS, 1) suggested also NBrb.: Qabyle (dial.) a-mriri [root?]
“tillage, ploughing” [Mlt.] as cognate, but (as kindly con"rmed by K.-G. Prasse,
p.c. on 30 Oct. 2006) the basic meaning of it is reciprocal, i.e. “joint agricultural
labour” and especially “contract for agricultural labour by mutual exchange” (m- is a
*mr 377



378 mr.t
reciprocal pre"x). The rest is based on a root )r-r. Qbl. a-m-riri is a verbal noun, but
the verb itself does no longer exist in Kabyle. It does however exist in Mzg. mrara
“1. to exchange (words); 2. group together (tribes)”. The simple verb also exists:
Mzg. rar (pf. irura) “to give back, restore”, which is an iterative verb (which has lost
its iterative meaning), and must be considered to be derived from the simple verb
represented by Tuareg ärr, Qbl. and Mzg. ërr “to give back, restore” (pf. yërra).
nb6: Forms like Bed. malaw “hache” [Chn.] !! NAgaw: Hamir baruw “Erde hacken”
[Clc.] = “piocher” [Chn.] !! LECu.: Saho ma-bar. “Erdhacke” [Clc.] = “houe”

149–150). Cf. rather Eg. b3 above.
nb7: The same seems to pertain to the comparison of PBrb. *ta-mur-t “land” [GT]
suggested by A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 104, fn. 31; 1985, 1, #1).
nb8: Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 207, #1808) combined the Eg.-Sem. word with SCu.
*mara"- “den, burrow (of burrowing animal), cave” [Ehret 1980, 342] as well as
Ch. *mar- “cultivated "eld” [Ehr.] (Ch.: JI 1994 II, 134–5).

nb: (1) C. W. Goodwin (1867, 86) af"liated it with Eg. mn.tj “agriculturists or

analogy of Lat. ligo vs. ligare vs. diligere, since the blade and the wooden stock of
the Eg. hoe were held together by a rope (Grif"th: “apparently owed its common . . . value
mr to being made of two pieces ‘bound’ together”). (4) F. Behnk (1928, 139, #30): ~ Ful
remer-go “Hacke”. (5) R. Moftah (1987, 139, fn. 22): Eg. mr “Hacke” (rendered

Spiegelberg (1908, 89) rendered its basic sense as “Landarbeiter, Leute der Hackarbeit, d.h. Landleute, nicht nur die eigentliche Landarbeit besorgend, sondern auch in dem ganzen witen Gebiet der ägyptischen Landwirtschaft tätig”, which he explained from Eg. (*)mr “mit der Hacke arbeiten”. R. Moftah (1987, 139, fn. 22) too af"liated it with Eg. mr “Hacke” (rendered also “P#ug”) and even mr “Meißel, Sichel” (sic) ~ Brb. (sic) e-mir-an “Sichel” (absurd). " 2. Alternatively, J.

nb3: The primary sense of the underlying Sem./AA root is disputable. Thus, (1)
F. W. M. Philippi (1875, 87–88) explained the original sense of Ar. mar"- “Mann”

Similarly, W. F. Albright (1918, 235, #61) and P. Fronzaroli (1964, 267, #2.36)
derived Sem. *mar"- from Sem. *mari"- “grasso”, while V. Bla&ek (2002, 104, §1.2)
combined the re#exes of our AA root with SBrb.: Hgr. ta-mâra, pl. ti-mâri-wîn “1.
force, 2. personne considérable” [Fcd. 1951–2, 1221]. (2) GT: is the primary mng.

[Levy 1924 III 233] !! Ar. ma/i/ur"- “homme” [BK II 1085] etc. instead of Aram.
*bar, R. C. Steiner (1982, 195/15, fn. 6) was inclined to consider it “entirely possible”
that Akk. m3ru has “two sets of cognates” (sic), i.e., a contamination of two distinct
Sem. roots in Akk., the one being *mar"-, the other one Aram. *bar “son”. Similarly,
T. M. Johnstone (1987, 271) derived Mhr. %2-mr. from )br" “to create” via pre"x
m-, which L. Kogan & I. M. D’jakonov (2001, 148, §5) accepted (“a situation which
is in fact widespread in MSA”, cf. Mhr. %2-mb2ráwt2n “boys, male children”).
nb5: The AA cognates adduced by M. Cohen (1947, #47) for Ar. mar"- are unten
able. The same applies to V. Bla&ek (2002, 104, §1.2) who compared WBrb.: Zng.
2-ma"rh “elder brother” [Ncl. 1953, 101].
NB6: H. Jungraithmayr and K. Shimizu (1981, 174: A2, 202: A1) assumed a con
nection of Ch. *m-r to Ch. *m-t, *m-z, *m-n, *m-m, deriving all these from a
monoconsonantal root *m-. Similarly, N. Skinner (1995, 33) explained Ar. mar"- and
Dangla umirne (above) as well as Ch. *m-t “woman” (!) from AA *m-n “person”!

“Glied” via the primary sense *“Band, Kette”.
nb3: E. Dévaud (1916, 206) explained the Cpt. word from mrrj.t “paquets (?)
(d’encens sacré)” (MK, q.v.) with a hint on vulg. Cpt. (S) oumaire Ntectaknh
“fasciculus myrrhae” (MMIFAO 6, 198). An eventual connection of MK mrrj.t with
the AA root underlying Eg. mr is indeed not impossible, although a direct inner Eg.
derivation of mrrj.t < mr is semantically rather unlikely.

merouo(o)Ce “a thing girt about the middle (?), belt” (sic) = “Kinnbacken”
(KHW 100: act. “Kinnbacken-Band” < Eg. mr + wgj.t), although É. Boisacq (1916,
628) pointed out the connection of the former with Gk. (?)2@(&"E97 “"l”, which
excludes an Eg. origin. Similarly, A. R. Bomhard (1981, 449; 1984, 274, #284) af"li
ated Gk. 2+(2&7 “cord, string, rope” with OIcelandic merð “"sh-trap (Fischreuse)”
etc. < IE *mer- “#echten, binden” (pace IEW 733), which, however, he regarded
as a “long-range” (Nst.) cognate of Eg. mr.

Abusir, PK 1976, 183: B26 & 367) = “sac, ballot” (Abusir: V., AL 77.1776) = “bundle (most common measure of vegetable)” ( Johnson 1996, 77f. after Janssen) > (S) mhr, ma(a)r, mer (m) “bundle” (CD 182a; CED 88) = “Bündel, Bund” (KHW 99; NBÄ) = “paquet” (DELC).

n. 820) and W. Schenkel (1983, 223) vocalized as *mãr.'w “Binde, Zeugstreife”

mr.t “Benennung der vier mit Binden umschnürten Behälter (für die vier verschiedenfarbigen Kleiderstoffe), die vor den Gott gezogen oder ihm geweiht werden” (OK, Wb II 108, 3–5) = “Kleiderkasten” (Pusch 1974, 20 after Junker: Giza III 50; Osing 1992, 65, 82) = “coffre” (AL 77.1783) = “mr.t-chests which contain coloured clothing” (Egberts 1983, 29–30) = “Meret-Behälter, Kleidertruhe (vier Truhen mit jeweils einem anderen Kleiderstoff, im Kult)” (GHWb 347).
nb: For the rites relating to the four mr.wt cf. Egberts l.c.
! As noted by E. Pusch (after Junker: Giza I 226, note), it may be derived from Eg. mr “binden” (q.v.).
mr.t “in den Bez. gewisser, nach Königen des Alten Reiches benannter Tempel” (OK, Wb II 108, 9) = “Kultstätte (?) der Hathor” (Anthes 1928, 21) = “Taltempel dem Kult der Hathor und dem Andenken des Stifters geweiht” (Helck in PWR XXIII 2208) = “Heiligtum, eng mit Hathor verbunden, vielleicht eine Kapelle der Hathor innerhalb des r3-š, innerhalb des Rahmens des Pyramidenkomplexes” (Gdk. 1967 KDAR, 70, n. 29) = “Königsresidenz (auf jene Fälle beschrenkt . . ., wo der König nicht in der traditionellen Residenz Hof hielt, sondern freiwillig . . . eine persönliche Residenz errichtete)” (Goedicke 1967, 6, n. o) = “Gebäude (seine Funktion als Kultort der Hathor ist klar; seine Lokalisierung in allen Fällen ist unsicher; die Gleichsetzung mit Taltempel ist unrichtig; mr.t und Sonnenheiligtum sind nicht identisch – sie kommen in denselben Texten getrennt vor –, aber sie sind in ihrem Wesen verwandt)” (Wildung 1969, 137–8 & fn. 7–10) = “Heiligtum” (Pusch 1974, 20) = “der Palast- und Totentempelgarten” (Görg 1976, 29) = “der Vorläufer der späteren Geburtshäuser der Spätzeit” (Kaplony 1977, 315, 320) = “vielleicht eine Kapelle innerhalb des r3-š, Kultort der Hathor, Art Gebäude” (Zibelius 1978, 41, 102) = “Haus mit eigenem Kult der Hathor und des Horus” (Helck, LÄ II 378) = “Haus, nicht für den Geburt eines Götterkindes, sondern für den des königlichen Thronfolgers Gebäude als Teil des königlichen Palastes; könnte . . . die Zeremonialbühne für die wohl alljährlich gefeierte kultische Vereinigung des regierenden Königs mit der in Gestalt der Göttin Hathor agierenden Königin

nb: The rendering “Taltempel” (Helck) was declined by H. Goedicke (1967, 6, n.
o) on the basis of an OK letter (Pap. Boulaq 8, l. 10): “eine derartige kultische Erklärung
gibt aber im vorliegenden Fall keinen Sinn, da offensichtlich ein sekulärer Verwaltungsbegriff
vorliegt”.
! Rendering and origin disputed: " 1. W. Helck (quoted apud Zibelius l.c.) af"liated it with Eg. mrj.t “Landeplatz” (q.v.). " 2. H. Goedicke (1967, 6, n. o & fn. 7) assumed a connection to MK mrr.t “Residenz, Quartier” (Gdk.) = “(vom Palast)” (Wb II 110, 11).
nb: This, in his view, does not contradict Hathor’s cult, which belongs basically to
the residence.
" 3. P. Kaplony (1977, 315, 320) saw in it the OK variety of LEg. pr-mr.wt “Geburtshaus” (lit. “Haus der Liebe”). Although this equation was doubted by W. Barta (1983, 102–4), both scholars agreed on the etymological connection of OK mr.t to Eg. mrj “lieben” and mr.wt “Liebe” (q.v.). " 4. K. Zibelius (1978, 102) identi"ed it with Amarna m3rw (q.v.). " 5. M. Görg (1976, 29) and W. Helck (LÄ II 378) too, assumed its etymological connection to both NK mr.w “Gärten vor einem Tempel” and Amarna m3r.w (q.v.). " 6. GT: any connection to Eg. mr “Art Gebäude” (late NK, Wb II 106, 1–2)?
nb: Cf. also mr “Gebäude (?)” (Pap. Berlin 23040a, frag. b, l. x+9, Burkard 1994, 102).
mr.t “Sängerin (?), Name zweier Göttinnen, besonders als Musikantinnen, auch als Göttinnen, die das Götterkind aufziehen” (OK, Wb II 107, 2–3) = “le rivage, le berge divinisée sous la forme des déesses protectrices de l’une et l’autre rive” (Langlois 1919, 156) = “goddesses and priestesses depicted playing the harp and sistrum on temple walls” (Gardiner 1936, 196) = “chanteuse” (Hickmann 1958, 127) = “musician-goddess” (FD 111) = “Sängerin” (Pusch 1974, 20 after Junker: Giza VII 37) = “a pair of goddesses characterized as mr.t-šm«w and mr.t-m%w, likely that they were singers from the out
set” (Brovarski 1987, 43–44, §23, esp. p. 44, fn. 2) = “Sängerschaft, Sängergruppe” (Guglielmi 1991, 9) = “songstress, singer” (PL 445).



392 mr
Attested also as coll.: mr.wt (coll.) “Sängerschaft” (III., Kahl & Kloth & Zimmermann 1995, 13D, 249).
nb1: Its det. (D41: forearm with palm of hand downwards) is identical with what
follows Eg. %s “to sing” indicating “the pantomimic gesticulation or hand movements in
chironomy” (Brovarski after Hickmann l.c.).
nb2: Glossed in the Tebtunis onomasticon with the apparently homophonous Dem.
ml3 “Art Schiff ” (DG 168, cf. Osing 1998, 155, n. d, 166, 168, n. e).
nb3: It is this word that A. H. Gardiner (l.c.) explained the OT PN Miriam (sister of
Moses and Aaron) from with special regard to the “distinctive character of her own . . . as
a prophetess and as musician”.
! Etymology uncertain: " 1. P. Langlois (1919, 156) saw in it a personi"cation of mrj.t (!rw) “port” (!), which he ultimately derived from Eg. mr (mour) “lier”. Recently, W. Gugliemi (1991, 9–10) has regarded it as an original coll. fem. and assumed (besides, ignoring Langlois’ paper) a similar etymological connection: “Zwar lassen sich über seine verbale Wurzel nur Vermutungen anstellen, mir scheint eine Ableitung von mr ‘binden’, ‘sich anschließen’ am wahrscheinlichsten, aber er ist . . . eindeutig mit ‘Sängerschaft’, d.h. wohl, ‘die (durch Gesang) verbundene Gruppe’, wiederzugeben”.
" 2. A. H. Gardiner (1936, 196) rendered its basic sense “the beloved”, which would derive “in all probability” from Eg. mrj “to love”. This etymology was in fact the one maintained by the Eg. priests as early as the MK. Rightly declined by W. Guglielmi (1991, 15 with further lit.) as a Volksetymologie (although more exact would be to use here “priestly etymology”).
nb1: Equally righly has Guglielmi (1991, 15–16) rejected another old etymology:
“Ebensowenig sind die Deutungen älterer Autoren wie R. V. Lanzone, J. Dümichen und G. Maspero
als ‘Uferland’ und ‘Überschwemmung’ zu halten . . . Sie sind deutlich von dem den ‘Nilen’ und
Mr.t-Göttinnen gemeinsamen Lotus- und Papyrus-Kopfschmuck inspiriert”.
nb2: Much deeper Eg. roots has the conception explaining the mr.t “als ‘Augen’ des
Himmelsgottes, eine Metaphorik, die auch anderen Göttinnen zugeschrieben wird” (discussed in
detail by Guglielmi (1991, 16–18 with further lit.). Of course, this approach has to
be also kept away from modern etymological analyses.

mr “Kampfstier, Bulle” (MK, Wb II 106, 8; Guglielmi 1973, 111 with MK exx.; ÄWb I 546: Abusir, V. 1x) = mrj “"ghting bull” vs.



mr 393
mr.w “bulls” (MK, FD 111–2; Caminos 1956, 23, 28, 39) = mr “Art Rind” (V.: Kaplony 1972, 224) = mr “bovidé, boeuf ” (V., PK 1976, 252, 322, 673: det. doubtful) = mr ~ mrj “Kampfstier, Bulle” (GHWb 347).
nb: Vocalized as *m]'rj/j (Fecht 1960, 10, §14).
! From the same root: (1) probably mr-wr “Name des heiligen schwarzen Stiers von Heliopolis: Mnevis” (XVIII.: Amarna, Wb II 106, 4–5; WD III 54: cf. SAK 10, 1983, 259f.) = “der Name des heiligen Stieres von Heliopolis” (Sethe 1929, 12) = “Mnevis-bull” (FD 112) > Dem. mrwr (DG168) > Gk. D"U#&7 ~ D"!FB7 ~ D"!]&7 and OCpt. emneui “Mnevis-Stier” (KHW 498 after Stz., WZKM 68, 1976, 186; AL 77.1778). Cf. also Mourski 1983.
nb1: Its "rst component was found as “zweifellos identisch” with MK mr ~ mrj by
G. Fecht (1960, 9, §12).
nb2: Old mr-wr > LEg./pre-Cpt. *mn-wj is regular according to P. Lacau’s Laut
gesetz on the Lautübergang r + m > tonloses *n/m/*m/n (Lacau 1922, 722; Sethe
1929, 12). G. Fecht (1960, 9, §13, fn. 25 & 10, §16) modelled the hypothetic shift
of *mnÉwi < *m'nrÉwi < *m'rrÉwi < *m'rjÉw' < *merjéj-wur'r (compound of
*m]'rj'j “Kampfstier” + wrr) on the analogy of Eg. mhr > mhn “Milchkrug” and
(B) menre-, menrit= etc. < *m'nr- (under the in#uence of m-) < *m'rr- <
*m'rj- or (as Fernassimilation) npr “Getreide” > npn.t “Getreidekorn” (Wb) > (S)
napre ~ napne.
nb3: H. Schäfer (quoted in Sethe 1899, §221) read the name as nm-wr with regard
to the phon. value nmj of the hrgl. O5 rightly declined by W. Spiegelberg (1904,
45–46), who, however, excluded the relationship of Eg. mr-wr and Gk. D"U#&7 as
“lautlich undenkbar” (falsely arguing that Eg. wr > only Gk. -9B(-). Instead, he traced
the Gk. form back to Eg. mnj “als Name des Mnevisstiers” (Lepsius) not ruling out
an etymological connection with Eg. mnmn.t “Herde” (q.v.). Although the latter idea
is out of question, a var. mnj to mr-(wr) is indeed not excluded. G. Fecht (1960, 7,
§10 & fn. 20), following H. Kees, pointed out a deviant var. form of Mnevis writ
ten as mnj-wr (sic) in CT V 205k (M1C, Meir) as well as nm-wr in three parallel
texts of CT V 191b from Bershe (B5C, B9C, B10C). Nevertheless, Fecht regarded
the 12th Dyn. CT vars. nm-/mnj- as sporadic “Hörfehler” (Kees: “Hörvariante”) and
as isolated “private Erzeugnisse fern vom Kulturzentrum des Stieres sentstanden”, while the
original form mr- was paradoxically (but logically) preserved in the Amarna stelae
representing “hochof!zielle Königstexte mit der ursprünglichen heliopolitanischen Auffassung”.
Fecht assumed Bershe nm- (written with phonetic signs) to be due to a false resolu
tion of the hrgl. O5 “da in der zeitgenössischen Aussprache das alte mr- bereits ein -n hinter
dem m- entwickelt hatte”. Also M. Moursi (1983, 260) regarded mr-wr as the original
var., “auch wenn dort (i.e., CT) noch öfters Mn/Nm-wr erwähnt wird”.
(2) perhaps mr.t “schwarze Kuh” (GR, Wb II 106, 10).
nb: Dubious whether it belongs here. Following B. Bruyère (1927, 66), J. J. Clère
(1952, 637) assumed a lit. meaning “l’aimée (?)”.

nb1: The Sem. forms have been usually derived from Sem. *mr" “to be fat”, cf.
Akk. m5ru “Mästung” [AHW] !! Ug. mr "u/ô/"a [Gordon 1965, 1544; WUS 1663],
which was convincingly doubted by L. Kogan (SED l.c.), since (1) )mr" is virtu
ally unattested in OT Hbr., and (2) no OT passage suggests that Hbr. m2r5" was a
fat(tened) animal, while (3) Akk. m5ru is not derived from marû “to be fat” either in
AHW and CAD. M. Franci (2005, 58) equated CSem. *mari"- “fat” (as “generally
a synonym of power and virility”) directly with Eg. mr ~ mrj “("ghting) bull”.

Fecht (1960, 10, §14): perhaps a nisba (*mr.j) of Eg. mr “Viehweide” (q.v.), hence literally “der von der Viehweide”.
nb: Fecht argued that “Es könnte eine tabuistische Umschreibung für die eigentliche Bezeichnung
des gefährlichen Kampfstiers vorliegen”.
" 3. W. A. Ward (1980, 357f.; AEB 34, #80.222) derived Eg. mr-wr and mr( j) from his hypothetic Eg.-Sem. *mrr “1. harsh, violent strength,



2. pain, 3. illness, 4. bitter” (sic) along with other untenable derivatives, such as e.g. Eg. 4r-mrj.t “crocodile” (!). " 4. F. Kammerzell (1999, 250, table 15): Eg. ml- (sic) ~ IE *mel“black”. Absurd.

mr.t “Auge (einer Gottheit)”, dual mr.tj “die beiden Augen” (BD 1x, GR frequently, Wb II 107, 10–15) = “l’oeil (du dieu)”, dual “les deux yeux” (Lefébvre 1952, 16, §17; El-Sayed 1987, 64) = “Auge des Königs” (Edfu, Kurth 1994, 13, §52).

early existence of the word attested by an unusual wtg. of the title mr “Vorsteher”
(Wb, q.v.) from Dyn. III written with m + two eyes.
nb4: H. Brugsch (1882, 68) af"liated it with GR mntj “eyes” on the basis of the
interchange of n ~ r < *l, but this late form may have an entirely distinct etymon,
being a var. of GR mnd “eye” < BD mn3.t “part of face” (q.v.).
! Origin highly debated. Most probable is #1. " 1. W. Vycichl (1951, 72) and G. Takács (1995, 159): ultimately cognate with Eg. m33 “to see” (with an interchange of 3 ~ r).
nb: Cf. also LEg. m3.tj dual. “die Augen (Sonne und Mond als Augen des Him
mels)” (LP, Wb II 11).
" 2. P. Lacau (1970, 150, §406) derived it via m- pre"x from Eg. jr.t “eye”. Followed by W. A. Ward (1978, 144–6, §287): “attractive suggestion and would strengthen the idea of a late dialectal variant” (speci"c for the Ptol. lexicon). Unconvincing. None of the functions of mseems to "t here.

! The use of the arti"cial word mr (bull sign + phallus det.) as a synonym for m3«.t is due to the interchangeability of mr “bull” vs. m3«.t

mr.t “Kehle o.ä. eines Gottes (von der m3«.t ’Wahrheit’ gebraucht, die

nb: No trace of the word from earlier than the GR. D. Meeks (2000, 239, n. l)
observed a certain mr.t (?) (#esh det.) in Ostr. Petrie 36 = Ostr. DeM 1696, rt. 1
“désignant une pièce de boucherie ou une partie du corps (humain ou animal)” (not
listed in the standard lexicons, cf. also Grandet 1999, 15, n. 68), although he regarded
“un rapprochement avec mr.t ‘gorge’. . .” as “très hasardeux” in spite of “des graphies de ce mot”
(listed in Guglielmi 1991, 113) that are “assez proches de celles de nos ostraca”.
! Meaning to be treated with reservations due to the very late attestation. Etymology problematic: " 1. G. Lefébvre (1952, 22 & fn. 9), J. Berlandini (LÄ IV 85), W. Guglielmi (1991, 14), and P. Wilson (PL 445) identi"ed it with OK mr.t “songstress” (PL) as an “incarnation de la chanteuse-chironome antique, of"ciante . . .” (Berlandini) = “organ over which the songstress had particular authority” (Wilson), although Wilson seems to be undetermined whether the association of both lexemes with Eg. m3«.t
was because “the three concepts make a potent pun” being interchangeable as they “may have sounded the same in sounding” in the GR era.
nb: The same way has been explained the interchangeability of Eg. mr “bull” vs.
m3«.t in the GR by A. M. Blackman and H. W. Fairman (ASAE 43, 1943, 255f.)
as well as by G. Fecht (1960, 9, §12) who pointed out the identical pronunciation
of both roots in the Ptol. era, cf. (S) me “Wahrheit” < m3«.t vs. (S) me “lieben”
< *m°rji.t.
" 2. GT: both LEg. mr.t “throat” and OK “songstress” are perhaps connected with WCh.: Hausa múryà “1. voice, 5. throat extracted from chicken” [Abr. 1962, 687], Gwandara murya “voice” [Skn. 1992, 356], which would not exclude the "rst etymological option (above).
nb: To be borne in mind that, in theory, there “could” be an etymological connec
tion between Hausa murya ‘voice’ and wúyà ‘neck’ [Abr. 1962, 937] as con"rmed
to me by P. Newman (p.c., 13 Nov. 2006), although he has “never been able to !nd
good internal or comparative evidence to show that this is so. Semantically, there is no problem.
Phonologically, however, the connection is problematic. Murya comes from *muri (the ya being



mr.t 401
a feminative suf!x and not part of the stem) whereas wuya (where the /y/ is part of the stem)
comes from *wura (or some such), the *r to y change being well documented. Initial /m/ in
Chadic is generally quite stable, and so it would be hard to explain an *m to /w/ change that
would be required if wuya went back to the same proto-form. And then, contrary to common
practice among certain Chadicists, one cannot simply ignore vowels, i.e., the !nal -i in one case,
!nal -a in the other”. Cf. WCh. *[%w]-yara “neck” [Stl. 1987, 239, #860] < PCh.

clear whether in the sole ex., where r was written following W19 + D54 (in the from

D. Meeks 2005, 245, #538c). Note that the ex. from the tomb of Ti (V., quoted in
ÄWb l.c.) may be alternatively rendered mrj “to like” (Meeks l.c.).

The phon. value mr ~ mj of the hrgl. W19 led Guglielmi to presuming “daß es leicht lautlich mit mj ‘komm’ zusammenfallen konnte”. A. Erman (1910, 42–43, §viii) admitted the interchange of OK mr with mj “come!” (q.v.) only in the NK (cf. RT 8, 98), “mit dem er nichts zu tun hat”. Even if Erman’s "rst point cannot be con"rmed, the OK use of W19 (still mr) excludes an etymological relationship with OK mj “come!”. " 2. W. Guglielmi (l.c.) saw in its OK wtgs. (with W19) an evidence (!) speaking rather for a connection to Eg. mr “binden” rendering our word as “etwa: bleibe (mir) verbunden” or “halte dich (an mich)!”. False (mr “to bind” is written with U7).
nb: This rendering would eventually lead to Eg. mr “sich anschließen an” (PT,
Wb, q.v.).
" 3. Alternatively, Guglielmi (l.c.) did not exclude an interjection: “doch zweifelhaft, ob der Ruf mr/mj überhaupt von einem Verb ableitbar ist und nicht nur den Klang der Leute wiedergibt”.

ra-a-mu-um [*ra"3m-um] “to love” [Frz. 1984, 148] !! Ar. r"m: ra"ima
“aimer qqch.” [BK I 795]. Cf. also Ar. rwm: r3ma “désirer ardemment, rechercher” [BK I 957] = r3ma “(heftig) begehren, wünschen, lieben”, ma-r3m- “Wunsch” [Vcl.] !!! NBrb.: Qbl. )r-m: ssi-rem “1. désirer, 2. se proposer, 3. préférer” [Dlt. 1982, 725].
lit. of Eg.-Sem.: Ember 1912, 89; 1930, #6.a.15, #10.a.19; Alb. 1918, 84; Holma
1919, 38; Chn. 1947, #413; Vcl. 1953, 374, #6; 1958, 150; 1958, 393; 1959, 29;
1959, 69, #18; 1959, 73; 1983, 106; 1990, 222.
nb1: F. von Calice (1936, #633) and Th. Schneider (1993, 81) considered this Eg.
Sem. comparison unsatisfactory, although the metathesis in roots containing m is
indeed not uncommon in Eg. as pointed out by W. Vycichl (l.c.).
nb2: In theory, Sem. *r"m could be alternatively compared also with Eg. jm3 [<
*"mr?] “angenehm, freundlich sein zu” (PT, Wb I 79, 10–13), jm3.t “Freundlichkeit,
Liebeswürdigkeit” (OK, Wb I 80, 1).
nb3: O. V. Stolbova (2005, 226–7, §36) equated Sem. *r"m with WCh.: Gerka
luum “to love” [Ftp.], for which cf. rather ECh.: Sarwa lQmQ “aimer” [ JI 1990
MS, 1, §6].
" 3. D. Ol’derogge (1954, 145; 1956, 13; 1960, 800), I. M. D’jakonov (1965, 50), and N. Skinner (1996, 197/9) combined Eg. mrj alternatively with WCh.: Hausa mármáríí (m) “desire”, mármártóó ~ màrmártà “to long to get” [Abr. 1962, 659], for which cf. perhaps also LECu.: Rnd. marma “to demand (sg.), insist (on sg.)” [PG 1999, 220].
ap: PNil. *mar “to desire”: Teso maria “to rush for, scramble”, Pokot mar “to seek,
desire”, Acholi maro “to love, like” [Dimmendaal 1988, 38, #47].
nb: Ug. 9mr “Wunsch” [WUS 1963, 25, #284] (alternatively rendered “Rede (?)”,
not so in DLU I 35) can hardly be related. It may be connected with Sem. *"mr
“to say”.
" 4. GT: or cp. LECu.: Afar m3r (m) “attachment (of love)” [PH 1985, 158] | Orm. marara “to be dear, loved, pleasing” [Gragg 1982, 280].
nb1: G. Gragg (l.c.) af"liated Oromo marara with Oromo m3ra “to have mercy on
a person” [Gragg 1982, 271, 436] | HECu. *marar- “to pity” [Hds. 1989, 418],
which may derive rather from ES, cf. Amh. marä “to have pity” [Gragg] (and
mrj 407



eventually from Eth.-Sem. *mrr “to be bitter, sad”). See also Skn. 1996, 9 (Eg.
ECu.). Less likely is a link to NBrb.: Rif *)m-r-w: Tuzin mbw-e2 [from *marw-et?]
“faveur, générosité” [Rns. 1932, 387].
nb2: There may be perhaps an AA var. root *m-y [GT]. Cf. CCh. *m-y (?) “to love”
[GT]: Bcm. mÜ “être d’accord, aimer” [Brt.-Jng. 1990, 93] | Daba may “vouloir,
aimer” [Mch. 1966, 135] = m3y “to like, want (desire)” [LG 1974, 22, #591–2]
| Lame-Peve . . . mây . . . “to like, want (desire)” [Schubert 1971, 16, #329–330]. Is
ECu.: Harso & Dbs. & Gwd. mayy- “to kiss” [AMS 1980, 254; Black 1976, 229]
ultimately related?
" 5. M. Cohen (1947, #413) equated Eg. mrj also with Eth.-Sem.: Harari mariI “friend” [Chn.] = mär5~ “companion” [Lsl.: “with an enigmatic suf!x -5Ïn”]. Cf. also Gurage dials. märi “friend (boy), companion” [Lsl.], Argobba meri “companion (boy), friend” [Lsl.], the ultimate origin of which is still unclear.
nb1: E. Littmann (ZS 1, 66) took these from Oromo märi “guide”, while W. Leslau
(1979, 417) preferred a derivation from Oromo märi “best man”. Afar
nb2: There are further AA terms for “friend”, but their connection either with Eg.
mrj or the ES forms (above) is obscure: thus, (1) N. Skinner (1996, 9) compared
the Eg. & Eth.-Sem. forms also with LECu.: Saho m3rÉyt3 “Verwandter, Freund,
Geliebter”, m3r1yt5nõ “Verwandtschaft, Freundschaft, Liebesverhältniss” [Rn. 1890,
270, 273], Afar m3rÉyt3 “Freund, Geliebter” [Rn. 1886, 884] = marèy-ta “close
friend for whom one would die (made so at a big feast)” [PH 1985, 164]. L. Rein
isch (l.c.) assumed in SA an etymon *m3rÉ-y-t3 lit. “von der Verwandtschaft, vom
gleichen Wohnort seiend” < SA m3r “die Zeit zubringen, leben, bleiben, wohnen,
sein” [Rn.], cf. Afar mare (f ) “family relationship” [PH], which excludes any cognacy
with Eg. mrj. (2) Cf. perhaps Rnd. mbrmîr “Freund, Beischläfer, Konkubine” [Schlee
1978, 140, #759] and/or (3) CCh.: Musgu mármai [Krause] = marmaya [Barth]
= mirmé [Ovw.] “Freund” [Müller 1886, 400; Lks. 1941, 66], Puss marmay “1. (m)
ami, 2. (f ) amie, "ancée, 3. amitié” [Trn. 1991, 103], Vulum (Mogrum) màrmày
“ami” [Trn. 1977, 17], Girvidik marmay “Freund(schaft)” [MB 1972–73, 70]? As
con"rmed to me by H. Tourneux (p.c., 17 Nov. 2006), the connection of the 2nd
component *-may to Puss may “ami, voisin, camarade” [Trn. 1991, 104] etc. is fully
uncertain: the latter word signi"es in fact “quelqu’un ou quelque chose comme”
(somebody or something like), “et ce mot est toujours accompagne d’un pronom complement
(something like it, somebody like her, etc.). Je vois une ressemblance formelle avec marmay, mais je
ne vois pas de lien etymologique entre may et marmay. Il y en a peut-etre un cependant”.
" 6. Th. Schneider (1993, 81; 1997, 198, §35) combines Eg. mrj with Ar. myl “6. aimer qqn.” [BK II 1174] = “être incliné vers, avoir de la sympathie pour, aimer bien” [Snd.] = “1. geneigt sein, 2. Sympathie emp"nden für, 3. gern haben” [Wehr 1238] = “avoir une prédilection” < “se tourner contre qqn., s’incliner vers qqn.” [Dozy II 630] = IV “to favour” [KB]. Improbable because of Cpt. -rr-.
nb: The basic sense of Sem. *myl was, however, different from that of Eg. mrj, cf.
Ma«lula maila “Seite” [Bergstr. 1921, 57] | Ar. myl: m3la “1. se pencher, s’incliner,
être penché, incliné vers le bas, vers la terre” [BK II 1174] | MSA *myl “to turn
aside” [GT]. In KB 556, Ar. myl is combined with Hbr. mwl hi"l “to fend off ”.
For further discussion see Eg. m3 “sickle (?)” (q.v.). Noteworthy are WCh.: Hausa
mèèlú & Kts. dial. mèèlí “to feel inclined” [Abr. 1962, 673].
" 7. GT: remarkable is AA *m-l “to desire, like” [GT], although unlikely because of Cpt. -rr-.

! Other suggestions are evidently false: " 8. G. von der Gabelentz (1894, 249) combined Cpt. mei with Bsq. maitatu “lieben”. " 9. P. Langlois (1919, 161) assumed Eg. mrj “diligere” to represent a secondary derivative of the basic sense of Eg. mr “ligare, lier” (with the most absurd re#exes). " 10. L. Homburger (1930, 285) Ful muy-de “avoir envie de”, yi*-ude “aimer”. " 11. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 94; 1934, 109; 1936, 435–6, quoted also in KHW 86) compared Eg. mrj with NBrb.: Zayan meru “Wunsch”, merw-et “Phantasie(begehren)”, e-meri “Freund, Liebhaber”, merz5zwa “Melissenkraut” (lit. “geliebt von Bienen”, cf. z5zwi, pl. z5zwa “Biene”) and SBrb.: Tuareg (sic) merhí “wollen, lieben”, Lamta merw “Wunsch, Verlangen”, which represent the “Reziprozität-Bildung” (Feichtner) = “Sozialstamm” (Rsl.) = “sozial erweiterte Form” (Zhl.) = “erstarrte m-Bildung von Sozial-Verba” (Rsl.) = “reciprocal form with m-” (Zbr.), namely *me-ri “einander wollen, lieben, begehren” [Zhl.] deriving from the root *ri. Zyhlarz tried to project this analysis also to Eg. mrj, which was strangely adopted by some authorities (Feichtner 1932, 221; Vycichl 1933, 180; Rössler 1950, 488; Schenkel 1983, 12; Zaborski 1997, 56), who supposed both in Eg. mrj and ms3j “to hate” (q.v.) a similar pre"x m- derivation (of the “Sozialstamm”) from an unattested root *rj and *s3j, resp., which “in prähistorischer Zeit in ein m- Prä!x . . . zerlegbar gewesen sein mögen . . .” (Snk.). Reviewing his position on the question "fty years later, W. Vycichl (1983, 106) "rmly (and correctly) rejected this theory.
nb1: This Eg.-Brb. comparison is probably false, the etymology of the common

a connection of Bed. aray < *araw < *ara1 (?) [GT] with Som.-Brb.-Eg. *r-b “to

nb1: The MK form mrw.t (quoted in NBÄ 265, 839, n. 1130; Snk. 1983, 224 as
the original etymon) is attested in CT V 46e (B1Bo). But an older form *mrw.t can
hardly be based on one occurence. P. Lacau (1972, 89, §77.3) analyzed the word
as mr.jt (sic) with a suf"x -jt of “noms géographiques”, but elsewhere (o.c., p. 97, §91.4)

nb3: (L) mraut “Hafen, Kai” treated by W. Westendorf (KHW 100) as a pl. of

*m'råwt.'t (NBÄ 337), while W. Vycichl saw in it a nisbe *mr.wt.j “port”, lit. *“endroit

Dem. mrj.t “quartier en Assiut” (DG 169) and Dem. mrwŸ “Fruchtland” (DG 169).
The latter comparandum is unlikely.
! From the same root (?): (1) mrj “vom #ottmachen des festgefahrenen Schiffes” (XVIII., Wb II 109, 11) = “to ground” (Grd., JEA 9, 1923, 17, n. 10) = “to strand” (Grd. 1925, 69, l. 18: “clearly connected with mrj.t ‘shore’, whence the meaning ‘strand’ is fairly obvious”) = “to run aground (of boat, ship), stranding” (FD 112 & Jones 1988, 215, §34 after Grd.) = “au#aufen, auf Land geraten, stranden” (NBÄ 196, 728–9, n. 871 after ZÄS 60, 1925, 69, l. 18) = “stranden” (KHW 498, 637) = “auf Grund laufen, au#aufen, stranden” (GHWb 348).



412 mrj.t
nb1: Correctly af"liated with Eg. mrj.t “bank” already by A. H. Gardiner (l.c.). The
connection can only be a denominal derivation from the latter.
nb2: Behind the NK wtg. mrj (inf.), a root *mr > mj was proposed in NBÄ l.c.
nb3: J. Osing (NBÄ l.c.) saw in it the ultimate source of (SL) (t-)emhre, (B)
(T-)amhiri (f ) “Überschwemmung” (for which, however, different etymologies have
also been proposed, cf. CED 35; KHW 498).

nb1: Vocalized as *mÉ/†r(a)w (NBÄ 265) = *mñr'w (Peust 1999, 120 & fn. 21).
nb2: MK mrw strikingly resembles the var. wtg. of mrj.t as mrw in the late NK, e.g.,
in Pap. Anastasi I 21:2, IV 1b:4, 10:5, Wenamon 1:x+8, 1:x+24, 1:13, 1:22, 2:74
(cf. Belegstellen ad Wb II 109, 13, 15 & 110, 1–2; Jones 1988, 205, §8). Does MK
mrw perhaps represent an early ex. of the masc. var. form of mrj.t (late NK)? Note
that R. Caminos (1954 LEM, 129) identi"ed %r-mrw of Pap. Anastasi IV rt. 1b:4
(treated in Wb as a mere var. of mrj.t) with Cpt. (S) Hi-mhr “on, at other side”
(CD 180a), which implies its separation from mrj.t. This distinction was extended
by J. ,erný (CED 87) and D. Meeks (1979, 248, §54) also to other exx. of late NK
mrw treated in Wb as masc. vars. of mrj.t, “d’où il convient d’éliminer les examples du
masculin mrw ‘rive (opposée)’ . . .” (Meeks). Cf. also Vergote (1950, 291).
nb3: Several authors (DG 168; NBÄ 838–9, n. 1127 & 839, n. 1130; KHW 99;
DELC 119) have already assumed a remote etymological connection of the under
lying etymons of Cpt. (S) !rw vs. mhr tracing back the latter to MK mrw (Wb
II 109, 3). Their distinction was, however, mainatined by J. ,erný (l.c.).
nb4: J. ,erný (CED 87) and J. Osing (NBÄ 265; 1998, 107–8, n. d) derived the
Dem.-Cpt. word directly from Eg. mrw “desert” (q.v.), cf. esp. mrw snb.w “the coast
(lit. the desert) is clear” (FD 112 after JEA 28, 1942, 11, n. gg).
! Etymology disputable. Most promising seems #5. " 1. J. Osing (NBÄ 265, 838–9, n. 1127 & 1130) derived both Eg. fem. mrj.t < mrw.t (*me/urãw.'t) and masc. mrw (*mÉ/†r(a)w) “Ufer” as well as mrw “Wüste” (lit. *“Seite, Rand”) from Eg. mr (sic) “stranden, au#aufen”. Mistaken, since their connection is only plausible vice versa (assuming in mrj “stranden” a denom. verb). " 2. W. Vycichl (DELC 119): Eg. mrj.t was “certainement” a fem. nisbe originating from Eg. mr “canal, étang” (q.v.). Unlikely.
nb: Written in CT I 234b indeed like a nisbe (DCT 173).
" 3. W. Schenkel (1983, 223–4) tried to explain both Eg. mrj.t < mrw.t and mrw “Wüste” (!) from Eg. mr “binden”, whence he derived also Eg. *jam)r(w).'t “Überschwemmung (eigtl. das, was über die Ufer



mrj.t 413
tritt)” > (SL) (t-)emhre, (B) (T-)amhiri “inundation, high water” (CD 56a). " 4. W. F. Albright (1918, 93) and F. von Calice (1936, #634) combined the root *mrj with Sem. *ml" “to "ll”. Semantically plausible, but
note Cpt. (S) -r-.

linked the Sem. root to Alt. *mìltce “full”.
" 5. GT: remarkable is Bed. mar “Seite” [Rn. 1895, 171] = mari “side, direction” [Rpr. 1928, 218], which has apparently no reliable Cu. cognates.
nb: V. Bla&ek (1994 MS Bed., 27) tentatively equated Bed. mari with WCh.: NBauchi

24; 1982, 141], but this is semantically uncertain.
! Other suggestions cannot be accepted: " 6. P. Langlois (1919, 150, 156) derived Eg. mrj.t “portus” from Eg. mr “lier, assembler” (q.v.), whence he took also Eg. t3-mrj (q.v.), mr.w (Pap. Anastasi IV 10:5) and mr “bassin, lac, canal” (q.v.). This did not hinder Langlois in comparing Eg. -mrj with Sem. *mi)r- “Egypt” (!) and Eg. mtr.w “Flut” (Amarna, Wb, q.v.) as well (including further absurd comparanda).



" 7. W. Westendorf (l.c.) combined Eg. mrw (and mrj.t) with Bed. b$r “1. Erde, Erdreich, Boden, 2. Gebiet, Land” [Rn. 1895, 50] (after Zyhlarz 1932–3, 59). Excluded. " 8. Ch.

with Gk. /%&2#(&7 “Bez. für das Delta” as suggested by K. Sethe (1906, 145)
! Etymology uncertain. " 1. P. Langlois (1919, 150, 155–7) explained it from the sense “le territoire de l’inondation captée, lit. endiguée” derived from Eg. mr “lier, assembler” (q.v.), which was correctly rejected by W. Guglielmi (1991, 9, fn. 45) as “unwahrscheinlich”. Equally surprisingly, from the same root took Langlois also Eg. mrj.t “portus” and mr “bassin, lac, canal” (q.v.), which is similarly unconvincing. All this did not hinder Langlois in comparing Eg. -mrj also with Sem. *mi)r- “Egypt” (!) and Eg. mtr.w “Flut” (Amarna, Wb, q.v.) as well (including further absurd comparanda).
nb: The form mr.w quoted by him from Pap. Anastasi IV 10:5 represents in fact

" 3. J. ,erný (CED 35) af"liated Eg. t3-mrj with Cpt. (SL) (t-)emhre, (B) (T-)amhiri (f), (SL) emhr (m) “inundation, high water” (CD 56a) = “Überschwemmung” (Snk.), LCpt.

414 mrj



#I.A.1) = dim5/1ra “time of (Nile) #ood” (Vittmann 1991, 209) = dim5/1ra “Zeit der Flut” (Snk.), in which ,erný assumed a backformation from (S) *te-mhre vs. (B) *T-mhri, i.e., t3 was taken for the fem. article, and the compound was treated as fem.: (S) *te
mhre became *t-emhre.
nb1: The etymology of the Cpt. word is disputed (cf. NBÄ 196, 728–9, n. 871:

< mrj.t “Uferdamm” ~ mrw “Wüste” derived ultimately from Eg. mr “binden”).
Strangely, his own suggestion was apparently ignored or declined by W. Schenkel
(2002, 20) stating of (SL) (t-)emhre, (B) (T-)amhiri that the “Etymologie des auf
den Artikel folgenden Substantivs” is “unbekannt”.
nb2: In any case, the hypothetic Eg. *mrj might be in principle linked to Ar. ma"ara
“1. remplir (une outre)” [BK II 1052].
mrj “sounding-pole” (MK, FD 112) = “Lotstange (zur Bestimmung der Wassertiefe)” (GHWb 348). " 1.

Hodge (1990, 173) falsely combined it with Ch. *mari “to give” [ JS 1981, 116], IE *m2r- “hand” [IEW 740] < LL *Nb-lH, which he ultimately derived from his LL *b-l “to carry” based on the most absurd comparanda (cf.

The same approach was followed by A. Erman (1896, 54) “. . . als zu sitzen unter
den . . . mit den (?) Krokodilen”.
! Etymology highly debated: " 1. Usually either identi"ed with or derived from Eg. mrj.t “riverbank” (q.v.), namely either (1) as a frozen compound 4r( j)-mrj.t “die am Ufer” (as suggested in Wb l.c.); (2) or as a coll. fem. form used metaphorically, lit. “bank-lurkers” (as thought by Faulkner 1956, 37, n. 81). H. Goedicke (1970, 136) assumes that “it might equally be a euphemism used to avert potential danger”.

Barma màrà “crocodile” (Goundi, Bousso) vs. màr (Njamena). Similarly, J. Fédry
(l.c.) supposed in Dangla a loan.
mrj (GW) “ausrutschen (?)” (XIX. hapax: Pap. Anastasi I 25:9, FischerElfert 1986, 225, n. c; GHWb 348) = “fright, fear” or “(straight) shot” (Hoch 1994, 134–5, §174).

Gardiner (1911, 27, n. 18) and H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (1986, 225, n. c). " 2. J. Hoch (1994 l.c.) explained it as an m- pre"x derivative of Sem. *yry (sic, instead of *wrw) “to shoot”. Alternatively, he derived it from Sem. *yr" “to be afraid” (cf. hence Hbr. m.r3" “fear, terror”)
assuming the “leg” + “walking legs” dets. of Eg. mrj to indicate “the result of panic”.
mrj (GW) “Pferdeknecht” (late NK, Wb II 110, 5; Helck 1971, 513, #95) = “palefrenier, cocher” (Ceugney 1880, 7 after Pierret) = “groom” (Grd. 1911, 6*, n. 16 & p. 37, fn. 4; AEO I 93*, #203 after Burchardt) = “le groom, valet de cheveaux, un terme désignant les soldats, apparemment d’infanterie” (Sauneron 1964, 24, §32) = “Stallknecht” (Störk, LÄ IV 1011) = “groom, fattener of cattle” (DLE II 226) = “groom, squire” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 80 index) = “a military position involving horses: froom (?), squire (?)” (Hoch 1994, 132).

nb2: It is this word that G. Sauneron (1964, 24, §32) explained Ptol. mr “un soldat”

! Apparently borrowed from Sem., but the ultimate source is debated: " 1. C. Ceugney (l.c.) misread the word with -«- (not to be read in
GW) and derived it (with pre"x m-) from Sem. *r«y > Hbr. r«y “to

on a Mari letter (after Wintermute) containing allegedly a nominal re#ex of mr" describing “the occupation of one who feeds sheep

" 3. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 38, §2.1.4.2) and W. G. E. Watson (1995, 538) identi"ed it with Ug. mr† “eine Art ‘Stallmeister’” [Sanmartín 1989, 346–7 & fn. 92] = “equerry” [Watson] = “member of a group or class: chief groom (?)” [DLU 571].
nb1: The etymology of Ug. mr† is disputed. W. Helck, J. Sanmartín, and W. G. E.
Watson (l.c.) mention an alleged Hurr. origin but failed to quote the Hurr. etymon.
W. Thiel (UF 12, 1980, 354, fn. 35) explained the Ug. title from Eg. (!), which was
rightly rejected by W. G. E. Watson (1995, 546).
nb2: Hence may derive Akk. mur"u “(etwa) Of"zier (?)” [AHW 677: from Ug.] =
“(an of"cial)” [CAD m2, 228] too as a late borrowing, although its etymology is
equally uncertain. CAD l.c.: “foreign word”. D. Rainey ( JNES 24, 1965, 18) derived
it from Akk. warûm “to command” [AHW 1471f.], while E. LipiIski (WdO 20–21,

nb1: Traditionally, the Hurr. and, hence, also the Sem. and Eg. terms have been
explained from Indo-Aryan *marya- > Ved. márya- (m) “young man, lover”, lit.
“mortal man” [Monier-Williams 1899, 791]. In Iranian, cf. Avest. mairya- (m) “etwa
Jungmann, Junker, Mitglied eines Männerbundes”, as a “da1vic” word: “Bube”
[KEWA II, 596–597]. Perhaps the "rst one to notice the parallel of Akk. marjannu
and Ved. márya- was H. Winckler (OLZ 13, 1910, 291–300), cf. Grd. 1911, *25,
fn. 1. This view has been since then maintained by several authors: Albright (1930,
217–221); Gordon (1955, 292, #1166); Mayrhofer (KEWA II, 596–597); Mayer
(1960, 86); Ward (1961, 39, #24, fn. 103); Kammenhuber (1968); Helck (1971, 513,
#96); Laroche (1980, 168); Segert (1984, 193); Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1984, 727);
Huehnergard (1987, 149); Hoch (1994, 135–7, §175); Watson (1995, 547; 1999,
130, §4.9.5). W. G. E. Watson 1995, 131 does not exclude that “. . . some [Ug.] words
may even have been borrowed back from the language which initially borrowed them”. There
are different scenarios as to the proper way of borrowing of Indo-Aryan *marya-.
W. F. Albright (1930), for example, insisted that the Indo-Iranians (whose words for
“horse” and “chariot” passed into Eg.) themselves took part in the Hyksos invasion
and that the "nal -n in Eg. mrjn re#ects instead of the Hurr. ending an acc. pl. end
ing of OInd. máry3n. This latter assumption is surely wrong. Following D. Rainey,
W. von Soden (AHW 611) derived Akk. mar(i)jannu directly from Indo-Iranian
(OInd. marya-, Avest. mairya- “junger Mann”). Noteworthy that the Indo-Aryan
word is supposed to have passed as a borrowing also into FU, cf. Cheremis mari( j)
“Mann, Mensch, Tscheremisse” [KEWA].
418 mrjn



nb2: Note that H. Winckler (OLZ 13, 1910, 300) erroneously af"liated Eg. mrjn with
Aram. *m3ri"- “lord”. Even worse is the suggestion by A. G. MacDowell (quoted
by Meeks 1997, 41, §175) on comparing the Eg. var. mrj (KRI VII 125:6 & Urk.
IV 1305:2) without the "nal -n with Ug. mr« (sic) “commandant” (pace Chabas),
which was rightly rejected already by A. H. Gardiner (1911, 25*, fn. 1) together
with the false rendering of Eg. mrjn as “lords” and its alternative equation with
Hbr. mry “to be contentious, rebellious”. The derivation of Akk. mariannu from
Aryan *marya- was doubted already by A. Gustavs (1929, 58, fn. 1), since among
the listed PNs of the bearers of this title “kein einziger ‘Arier’ ist”.
nb3: Others derive the Near Eastern term from (or, at least, via) Hurrian instead of
Indo-Iranian. J. Huehnergard (1987, 149) and D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992,
40): Eg. ~/< Ug. < Hurr. < IE. But more reasonable seems the following way: Eg. <
Sem. (Akk./Ug.) < Hurr. < (?). Already A. Gustavs (1929, 58, fn. 1) tried to render
the title as a native Hurr. term deriving from the stem mari- “besitzen” + ending
-anni of participles (!) and thus denoting “Besitzer” (cf. also ZA NF 2, 301). I. M.
Diakonoff (1963, 89; 1972, 114, #c.5, 115, fn. 93; Djk-Sts. 1986, 21, #18; 1988,
173, #18) and M. L. Ha'ikjan (1985, 47) related the Hurr. expression with Urart.
LÚmari/e [*mar2] “1")*"%6” [Djk. 1963; Melikišvili 1971, 286] = “Bezeichnung
einer der höheren Gruppen der königlichen Angestellten” [Djk. 1972] = “a rather
highly placed group of people of the palace personnel” [Djk.-Sts. 1986; 1988] =
“category of warriors” [Djk. 1995, 122], from which Diakonoff reconstructed a
common Hurro-Urartean *mari-.
nb4: Most recently, some Russian specialists assumed the Hurro-Urartean word to
represent the heritage of the supposed common East Caucasian proto-language,
which implies that the ultimate Indo-Aryan origin of the ancient Near Eastern term
has to be declined. This theory was defended by M. L. Ha'ikjan (1985, 141, #54.3)
mentioning a common NCauc. root mari- (sic) “husband”. Later, I. M. Diakonoff
and S. A. Starostin (1986, 21, #18; 1988, 173, #18; cf. NCED 830–1; Djk. 1995,
122, #7) proposed the genetic comparison of PHurro-Urartean *mari- with PECauc.
*m[3]rÂV/*m.rÂV “male” (attested in Archi me§c-le, Kryz miîg/3-il, Dargwa marga
“male”, Tabasaran murgu-&vi “brave man, hero”, PNakh *m3re > Bacbi & Ingush
mar “husband”, Chechen mayra “husband, brave man, brave”), where HU *-r- <
PECauc. *-Â- was regular and the inlaut PECauc. *-r- was dropped in the cluster.
V. V. Ivanov (1979, 101–112) tried to combine both hypotheses supposing that the
PECauc. term itself was an early borrowing from some IE (Indo-Iranian?) dialect,
which was rejected by Diakonoff arguing that at the diachronic depth of the Proto
Hurro-Urartean level, it would be hard to point out any Indo-Iranian in#uence.
mrjn.t (GW) “a vessel” (hapax: Pap. BM 10795, fragm. C II 11, late NK or thereafter, CED 88) = “ein Gefäß” (KHW 520, 637) = “reservoir (?)” (AL 77.1788) = “*Reservoir, *Tank” (GHWb 348).
nb: Vocalized as ma-ru2-ya-ni-ta: *maluyanita (Hoch).
! Hence: Cpt. (B) meran, mhran (via *merant?) “trough, tank” (CD 183a) = “Wasserbehälter” (KHW 100, 520) = “bassin, auge” (DELC 120).
nb: This derivation suggested by J. ,erný (CED 88) and W. Vycichl (DELC) was
declined by J. Hoch (1994, 137, fn. 44) as “rather dubious”.
! Apparently a late borrowing, although its source is uncertain.
nb: J. Hoch (1994, 137, §176) proposed two weak options, neaither convincing:
(1) lit. *“that which is "lled” < Sem. *ml" “to "ll” (but Eg. -nt remains obscure);
(2) m- pre"x derivative of Sem. *rwy, cf. Hbr. rwy “to drink one’s "ll” (but it has
no m- pre"x forms).

Caminos 1954 LEM, 122 (with lit.).
nb2: To be separated from NK mr (GW) “a foreign timber” (as suggested by Glan
ville 1932, 13, §19)?
! No certain etymology. It has been (or might be) compared with various tree names (though their common origin is doubtful): " 1. H. Holma (1919, 39), F. von Calice (1936, #412), and V. M. Illi'Svity' (1976, #283) combined it with Ar. marw- “2. sorte d’arbre (macrua)” [BK II 1097] = “pierre ponce” [Dozy II 585] = “nomen arboris” [Holma] = “Holzart” [Clc.] (apparently isolated in Sem.).
nb1: OK mr(w) can hardly be a loan-word from Ar. as supposed by Calice and
Illi'-Svity'.
nb2: Illi'-Svity' ultimately derived the Ar.-Eg. parallel from Nst. *marV “(0/0-!
(tree)”.
" 2. GT: connected to AA *m-r “acacia” [GT]?

" 3. GT: in spite of their semantical closeness, it has hardly anything to do with Akk. ( jB) *amalu (hapax) “eine Fichte” [AHW 40] = *am3lu - aš$0u “"r tree” [CAD a2, 1].



nb2: May be a ghost-word created on the basis of one single (misunderstood?) place
by the Akk. commentator (p.c. by E. Reiner and D. Testen, 7 Feb. 2000).
" 4. A. M. Lam (1993, 412) af"liated it with Ful (Pulaar) meri “variété d’arbre utilisé pour la fabrication d’objets utilitaires”.
mrw “Wüste, bes. als Ort der Wüstentiere und als Herkunftsort kostbarer Gesteine” (XVIII., Wb II 109, 5) = “desert” (FD 112) = “desert edge” (CED) = “Ufer (sic), Wüste” (Schenkel 1983, 223) = “désert, lisière, bande, plateau désertique” (Aufrère 1990, 12, 16, 44, 721–2, 746).
nb: It is from this word that J. ,erný (CED 87) explained Dem. mr “the other side”
(cf. DG 168:1) and Cpt. (S) mhr “shore of river (esp. the opposite one)” assuming
a basic sense “edge”, which is probably mistaken. Vocalized by W. Schenkel (1983,
223) as *m†raw, which hardly accords with Dem. mjl “Wüste(nrand)” attested as
a gloss to Eg. mrw in the Tebtunis onomasticon (Osing 1998, 107–8 & n. d, 309
index).
! Its proposed equivalents are disputable: " 1. C. Brockelmann (1932, 105, #27) and F. von Calice (1936, #52) related Eg. mrw with Sem. *barr- “freies Feld” [Brk.] and Ar. barra “gut, fromm, gehorsam sein” [Brk.]. Impossible both phonologically (Eg. m- & Sem. *b-) and semantically (the Sem. root means “open, free”). " 2. E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 245) af"liated it with Nile Nub. bur “kahl, unbesät”. False. " 3. L. Reinisch (1887, 83), F. von Calice (1936, #52), J. Vergote (1945, 135, #8.b.1), M. Cohen (1947, #398), J. H. Greenberg (1965, 91, #17), A. Zaborski (1989, 587), and C. T. Hodge (1991, 99) compared Eg. mrw “desert” with common Brb. *ta-m"r-t “pays, terre cultivée” [Chn.] and even Cu. *bVr(r)- “desert (or sim.)” [GT].
nb: Brb. *ta-mur-t has a more convincing cognate in Eg. mr “Viehweide” (OK,
above). Comparing Eg. mrw with Cu. *bVr- should be de"nitely abandoned (cf.
Eg. b3.t in EDE II 33).
" 4. O. Rössler (1971, 313) equated Eg. mrw with Ar. mal3 ()mlw) “désert” [BK II 1153] = “Wüste” [Rsl.], although Ar. )mlw primarily means “marcher d’un pas vigoureux et rapide, et se mettre à courir de toutes ses forces” [BK]. " 5. J. Osing (NBÄ 838–9, n. 1127), followed by S. Aufrère (1990 l.c.), explained Eg. mrw from a basic sense “Seite, Rand” and af"liated it with Eg. mrj.t (q.v.) rendered by Aufrère “rivage, désert” > Cpt. (S) mrw (f ) “harbour”, which was rightly declined by H. S. Smith (1978, 360). " 6. W. Schenkel (1983, 223), in turn, derived it from Eg. mr “binden” (q.v.). Semantically very weak.
mrw 421



" 7. A. M. Lam (1993, 395) connected it with Ful (Pulaar) m1re “le vide”, m1ru “vide (en parlant p.ex. d’une chambre)”, which is incorrect, since (1) a genetic cognacy is excluded, while (2) in the case of borrowing, such a semantic shift would be dif"cult to explain.
nb: Nevertheless, cf. NBrb.: Qbl. e-mmir “être vidé, versé, vide” [Dlt. 1982, 511].
" 8. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 202, #1795) compared it with Omt. *mel“1. dry, 2. empty” [Ehr.], which represents a plausible cognate. " 9. GT: whether it is connected with Ar. )mrw: marwar-3t- “désert” [BK II 1097] or Ar. mar5r- “5. désert” [BK II 1084] cannot be decided.
nb: Ar. m$r- “poussière soulevée par le vent” [BK II 1167] = “dust” [KB], incor
rectly combined with Hbr. mar “speck” [KB 629], is certainly out of question, the
underlying root being Ar. mwr “s’agiter et aller çà et là” [BK].
" 10. GT: or cp.

nb2: W. Westendorf (KHW 100) derived the Cpt. term, with hesitation, from LEg.
wrm “hochragende Figur” (GR, Wb I 333, 1), whose root (Eg. *wrm “to rise, be

nection to Ar. ramr$m- “navis alta” (suggested in CD, KHW) is dubious.
! Apparently a late borrowing. J. Hoch (1994, 137–9, §177) assumed a pattern *marô/êma (?), which he explained from Sem. *rwm “to be high” (cf. Ug. mrym “heights”, Hbr. m3r.m “height”, Phn. mrm “elevated”, etc.), which is ultimately akin to Eg. *wrm (cf. above).

“under the root MLLY as there is no way of proving by means of Tuareg that it is a derived
verb. As all verbs of this type it may, however, be an assimilation of mëlëylëy. It is further
probable that the M is a re"exive pre!x. Fortunately, Tamazaight (Central Moroccan) can help
us to solve the problem as it has both a verb ëllëy ‘turn round; vibrate; be/feel dizzy’ (WLY)

too correctly pointing out the latter to be cognate with Ar. %mr (see below).
! Hence (as secondary denominative verb?) mr% “1. salben, 2. auch vom Versehen einer Ton"gur mit Glas#uß” (LP, Wb II 111, 11–12) = “salben, beschmieren” (Grapow).
nb1: H. Grapow (1914, 26) derived this late verb directly from wr%. Similarly, H.-W.
Fischer-Elfert (1986, 32, n. 3:3) points out mr% vs. wr% to be in Pap. Anastasi I 3:3
“orthographische Varianten éines Wortes: ‘Salben’ . . .” assuming an interchange of w- ~
m- (Westendorf 1962, §34.3.aa).

! Prima vista, it seems logical and natural to accept its traditional etymology (#1) spread in Egyptian philology. But since the origin of Eg. wr% is obscure, while Eg. mr%.t has convincing AA etymology (cf. #2), one is tempted to suppose in Eg. wr% a back-formation created when the use of m- as nomen instr. pre"x was still active in Eg.

gner de parfum” [BK II 946], cf. also Hbr. rw% B hi"l “to smell (a fragrance)” [KB

nb3: Cf., however, Ug. mr% (hapax of disputed mng. in a text relating generally about
objects for cosmetic use by women) “vessels for perfumes (?)” [Heltzer] explained
by M. Heltzer (1978, 27, 58, n. 136) from )rw% “to #avor” and combined by
W. G. E. Watson (2002, 924, fn. 35) with Eg. mr%.t “though this is only a surmise”.
Note that a Eg. mr%.t “oil-jar (?)” (hapax in CT VII 447a) was deduced by R. O.
Faulkner (1981, 173) from the cryptic hrgl. written with the ideogram of a (stand
ing vs. squatting) man pouring #uid from a jar on his head which in B1L-B3L is
det.-ed with an ointment-jar.
" 2. The identi"cation of Eg. mr% with Sem. *mr% ~ *mr0 “to anoint, rub with fat or oil” [Bomhard 1981, 448–9], which has also been maintained by numerous authors, represents a plausible etymology. Interestingly, both A. Ember (1911, 90) and A. G. Belova (1991, 88, #13; 1993, 53, #13) tried to af"liate Hbr. & Ar. mr% with both Eg. wr% and mr%.t pretending that the Sem. root may also contain a secondary m- extension, which is, however, excluded.

nb2: With respect to the generally accepted inner Eg. etymology of mr%.t < wr%,
F. von Calice (1936, #566) and W. F. Albright (1944, 24, #1) explained Sem. *mr%
as an early borrowing from Eg., whereby Calice considered Ar. mr0 a result of
contamination with mar0- “Holz, durch dessen Reibung man Feuer macht” (cf.
Eg. m34, q.v.). Albright (approved by Lambdin 1953, 152 contra Calice), in turn,
semantically separated Hbr.-Aram.-Ar. mr% (with a basic sense “to smear”) vs. Ar.
mr0 (basic sense “to soften”). Gaster (1944, 20–21) traced back Hbr. mr% to Sem.
*mr0 with regard to Ug.-Ar. mr0. Thus, Hbr. mr% cannot have been a loan from
Eg. mr%.t. Strangely, Muchiki (1999, 249–250) surmised in either Hbr. mr% “to rub”
or Eg. mr%.t “to rub” (sic) a loan stressing even that “it is very dif!cult to discriminate
between cognate and loanword in this case”. Surprisingly, Muchiki was ready to assume
two alternative scenarios (neither correct): (1) if the cognacy of Hbr. mr% with Ar.
mr0 is valid, it “is a Semito-Egyptian loanword” (sic), or, (2) if not, the Hbr. verbal root
was a “likely” loan-word (!) from Eg.
nb3: Whether Sem. *mr0 or *mr% was the original root is debatable. Eg. mr%.t
and the comparison with Brb. *m-r-y [reg. < *m-r-%/«] “to rub” [GT] (suggested
by A. R. Bomhard 1984, 276) speak for the AA origin of Sem. *mr%. Cp. NBrb.:

Ayr 2-mr2y “1. frotter (avec qqch. de dur), 2. effacer en frottant, 3. écorcher” [PAM
1998, 223; 2003, 555]. Note that Brb. *-y can continue i.a. PAA *-% but not -*0 (cf.
Mlt. 1991, 245–6; Vcl. 1992). However, Brb. *m-r-y < AA *m-r-y should also be
accounted for, cf. LECu.: Som. mári “reiben, streifen” & “Bestreichung, Reibung”
[Rn. 1902, 299], which might be an evidence for a bicons. AA *m-r “to rub (over),

nb4: The third root consonant in Sem. *mr% etc. can be analyzed as a C3 root
extension (complement) as pointed out by several authors (Reinisch 1887, 274;
Drexel 1925, 9; MM 1983, 166 comparing Ar. mr0, mr3, mr%; Bomhard 1984,
275–6, #291; Bomhard 1990, 404 comparing Sem. *mr0, *mr«, *mr=, *mr9), cp.
(1) Ar. mara«a I “2. oindre abondamment d’huile (la tête, les cheveux), 3. peigner
les cheveux” [BK II 1093] = mara«a “kämmen, salben, auch: voll (gestrichen) sein”
[Philippi] = mara«a I & II “reichlich mit Öl salben, kämmen”, mur«-at- & mir3«
“Fett” [R|&i'ka] = mara«a “to anoint abundantly” [Ehret] < Sem. *mr« “to rub,
anoint” [Bmh. 1981, 448–9]; (2) Ar. mara3a “oindre abondamment d’huile et en
imbiber un corps” [BK II 1093] = “to anoint with oil” [Ehret]; (3) Sem. *mr= “to

[Lsl.]: Tigre maraga “to cover with clay” [LH 116b; KB 638] = märräga “to smear

NAgaw: Bilin marg “mit Lehm, Ton verstreichen, verschmieren” [Rn. 1887, 274]
!! LECu. (from ES): Orm. máraga “to plaster, whitewash, smear (mud on house)”
[Gragg 1982, 279], which W. Leslau (1969, 20) equated with Sem. *mr=. (6) Ar.
marasa I “essuyer, p.ex. la main avec qqch.”, IV “3. essuyer (p.ex. sa main avec
une serviette)”, V & VIII “se frotter contre qqch.” [BK II 1090]; (7) Ar. marata
“lisser, glacer, rendre lisse, poli” [BK II 1086]; (8) Sem. *mr9 “to rub, polish, clean,
scour” [Bmh. 1984, 275–6] = “1. to rub, scratch, 2. make sooth by plucking out”
[GT] (discussed s.v. Eg. m3d, q.v.). Ch. Ehret (1989, 181–2, §53) established the
bicons. Ar. *mr- “to brush with the "ngers” i.a. on Ar. mr«, mr%, mr3, mrq, mrt
(above), but also on a number of semantically uncertain comparanda: mr2 “to crush
with the "ngers”, mrz “to press slightly with the "ngertips”, mrs “to macerate and
crush with the hand”, mrš “to scratch with the nails”, mry “to strike the udder of
the camel for milking”.
nb5: This biconsonantal analysis can be projected also to the AA cognates. Thus,
W. Drexel (1925, 9) correctly combined Sem. *mr- (deduced from Hbr. mr% vs.
mr9) with WCh.: Hausa múrzà “to rub sg. between one’s palms” [Abr. 1962, 687]
= “reiben” [Drexel].
nb6: This is why unacceptable is the suggestion by R. R|&i'ka (1911, 131) to take
Ar. mr% and mr« etc. from a common biconsonantal Ar. *r3 ~ *r0 ~ *l3 “von dicken,
fetten Körperteilen” (sic).
nb7: F. W. M. Philippi (1875, 87–88) af"liated Ar. mr0 “mit Öl bestreichen” and
mr« “salben (gestrichen voll sein)” with Hbr. mr" “stark, fest, gesund, kräftig sein”
and a number of unacceptable comparanda like Hbr. mry “widerspenstig sein”, Ar.
mry “uber stringere mulgendi causa, schlagen, peitschen”, marra “vorübergehen,
binden, fesseln”, marmara “rinnen, #ießen” (explained from *“dahinstreichen”),
marra “bitter sein (von stringendem Geschmack)”, mrh “krank sein” etc., which he
430 mr".t



derived from a common Sem. bicons. *mr- “streich/fen, straff/mm sein”. Similarly,
V. Bla&ek (1999, 70, #104) combined the Eg.-Ar. root mr% with the ECu. & WCh.
re#exes of AA *m-r “fat” [GT] (below).
nb8: A number of extra-AA parallels have also been suggested. Most convinc
ing is the comparison of Sem. *mr0 vs. *mr« and Eg. mr% with IE *(s)mer- “to
smear, anoint, rub with fat or oil” by A. R. Bomhard (1981, 448–9) as well as the
equation with MElam. mirri- “to smear” [HK 1987, 923, 935] ~ Drv. *mer- “to
smear, rub” [DED #4709] or *meEuk- “1. to smear, plaster; 2. wax” [DED] by V.
Bla&ek (1999, 70, #104). H. Möller (1911, 168) erroneously combined Ar. mara0a
with IE *mVrk- (sic) “eingeweicht sein”. L. Reinisch (1873, 255), in turn, af"liated
Eg. mr%.t and Amh. mrg with a number of absurd parallels. The same pertains
to the equation of Eg. mr%.t with Bsq. bilgor ~ milgor “Talg” apud G. von der
Gabelentz (1894, 197).
" 3. On the other hand, equally widespread is the alternative comparison of Eg. mr%.t with the re#exes of common AA *m-r (with diverse C2 vs. C3 extensions) “fat (noun/adj.)” [GT] = *maw/yr- [Blz. 1990,
209] = *mar- “fat” [Mlt. 2005, 360–1; 2005, 580].

did not exclude the common origin of LECu. *m.r- (!) and Ch. the root for “fat,

#291; 1990, 404; Blz. 1999, 70, #104; cf. HSED #1784 & #1804) also compared
Sem. *mr0/% “to rub, smear” with common Ch. *m-r “fat, oil”. In any case, this
would imply a kinship between Sem. *mr% vs. *mr" (declined for semantical reasons
by Diakonoff & Kogan 1995, #1804; Kaye 1997 MS, 2; Takács 1999, 105), which is

only plausible if we assume for Sem. *mr- (with diverse extensions) a primary mng.
*“to rub, smear with fat”, cf. especially Ar. mara«a I “2. oindre abondamment d’huile
(la tête, les cheveux)”, mur«-at- & mir3«- “graisse” [BK II 1093] = mr« “salben,

nb3: W. Leslau (1988, 195) explained the ECu. forms as loans from Eth.-Sem., cf.
Amh. mora “animal fat” [Gragg], but L. Bender (2003, 16, §46) assumed just the
opposite direction borrowing.
nb4: H. Jungraithmayr (1989, 256) derived some of the WCh. (Hausa, Sura, and
Kulere) re#exes from a common WCh. *m-k-l (!).
nb5: E. Wolff & L. Gerhardt (1977, 1538–9) combined the Ch. root for “oil, fat”
with BC: Mbla & Mama muru, Wurkum muru3, Nagumi m#r$. In the view of
H. Jungraithmayr & D. Ibriszimow (1994 I 63), the Ch. root for “fat” “cannot be
reconstructed, since they stem from different NC languages” (!). As to the Ch. words for “oil”,
here too, they ( JI 1994 I, 130) suggested a derivation from some NC source: “its
re"exes undoubtedly stem from NC languages . . .”, which is rather unlikely as they also
admit that the eventual cognacy with the Sem. parallels “deserves further consideration
in a wider African-Asian context”.

“a numerous family of words . . . signifying various kinds of natural products (both mineral and vegetable)”, in which they equated Eg. mr%.t (with original *-l-) as “etymologically identical ” (Goodwin) with Eg. mn% [*ml%] “wax” (q.v.), mr% “bitumen” (Goodwin) = “Asphalt” (Wb, q.v.), Sem. *mil%“salt” [Frz.] = “Salz, Fett” (!)

This absurd comparison is evidently wrong.
nb: These words stem from unrelated AA roots: (1) for Eg. mn% “wax” cf. above;
(2) for Eg. mr% “bitumen” see below; (3) Sem. *mil%- may be cognate rather with
Eg. %m3.t [*%ml.t from *ml%.t via met.] “Salz” (MK, Wb III 93–94) as suggested
by F. Behnk (1927, 82, #25) and W. Vycichl (1988, 485; 1990, 39).
mr# “Asphalt” (Lit. MK, Wb II 111, 13) = “a species of bitumen (or a mixture containing bitumen used in embalming) or (liquid) asphalt or possibly petroleum”, mr% n 0t “wood tar, wood pitch or resin” (Harris 1961, 173–4, 234) = “Holzteer oder Art Asphalt” (NBÄ 747, n. 909) = “Teer oder Pech (?)

genetic relationship. Possible, especially if we accept the derivation from the Sem.

nb3: É. Dévaud (l.c.) rightly stressed the distinction of Eg. mr% from mr%.t (contra
Loret 1894, 158), which J. R. Harris (1961, 173–4) accepted too (“the distinction is
right”), although he did not rule out that eventually both “may well be the same word”,
which is hardly correct provided we accept the Sem. etymology.
nb4: The inner Sem. etymology of the term is obscure. R.M. Voigt (p.c., 8 Dec.
2006) sees no reason for “Zweifel an der traditionellen Sicht, dieses Wort von der Wurzel
für ‘rot’ abzuleiten” since “Asphalt ist zwar eher schwarz, aber vielleicht leuchtet er rot bei der
Erhitzung”. M. Bulakh (Moscow, p.c., 15 Dec. 2006) views, however, “!"#$ #%#$
%&'('$%)$*+,-(%#$* %mr ‘'.(*%/0’ (1%)$%)2#%,"%#, 2#!)13 (*4(56" 7#58)%
(**#9&&.#+(":*, * '.(*%/1$ 9+)"#1)”.

Others, i.a., Loret (1894, 157–8), Chassinat (1922, 463), Harris (1961, 173–4), ,erný (CED 7), Osing (NBÄ 209, 747, n. 909), and Westendorf (KHW 6), however, treated it as etymologically identical with Eg. mr%.t < wr%. H. Grapow (1914, 26) too assumed an m- pre"x form, but carefully avoided the mention of wr% as well as mr%.t. Rejecting a direct m- pre"x derivation, G. Fecht (1960, 180, fn. 505), in turn, explained it from LEg. mr% “salben” (Wb, q.v.). J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 156) too saw in its supposed etymon *mar†%u a pass. part. (“celui qu’on étale”) of LEg. mr% “oindre”.
nb: C. W. Goodwin (1867, 87) assumed “a numerous family of words . . . signifying various
kinds of natural products (both mineral and vegetable)”, in which he erroneously equated
Eg. mr% (with original *-l-) as “etymologically identical” with Eg. mn% [*ml%] “wax”
(q.v.), mr%.t “oil” (q.v.), Sem. *mil%- “salt”, Hbr. man “manna” etc. Goodwin even
included Ar. mr% “to rub with oil”. Absurd.
mr# “verderben, vergehen (Seele, Leichnam, Platz)” (XVIII., Wb II 111, 14–20) = “to go to ruin” (Badawy 1956–57, 73) = “to decay (of buidings)” (FD 112) = “deterioration” (Ward) = “to decay, pass away” (PL 443). ! GT: most probably, (an irregular?) cognate of Akk. (a/jB) mar30u “to allow to become spoiled (?)”, cf. mir0u “ergot” [CAD m1, 265 & m2, 106] !! JAram. (TTM) m2ra% nifal “to be crushed into a viscid mass”, cf. pael “to strike off the pile, "nish” [ Jastrow 1950, 841], Samar.
Aram. mr% “spoiling”, mrw% (q!39ol adj.) “spoiled” [Tal 2000, 485] | OSA mr% “to destroy (/)1/<;3*.)” [IS 1976, §310 < ?].
nb1: The identi"cation of the Akk.-Aram. root is due to A. Tal (l.c.). Usually, Akk.
0 points to Sem. *0, but L. Kogan (1995) demonstrated the lexical evidence for
occasional shift of Akk. 0 < Sem. *%, which is con"rmed in our case by OSA mr%.
It was V. M. Illi'-Svity' (l.c.) to af"liate the OSA root with PBHbr. mr% “(ab)reiben,
bestreichen” [Levy 1924 III 248] = “ab-, zerreiben, glätten” [GB] = “/)'*3/)*.”
[IS] < OTHbr. mr% qal “mit einem Heilmittel bestreichen” [GB 461], which would
imply a remote cognacy with Eg. mr%.t “oil” (q.v.). W. von Soden (AHW 608) too,
suggested a relationship of Akk. mar30u ~ Sem. *mr0 “einreiben”.
nb2: Presumably no connection to NOm.: Gamu m.r- “1. to make a mistake, 2.
spoil, destroy” [Sottile 1999, 429] whose basic sense might have been different.

nb1: W. M. Müller (1893), W. Vycichl (1958; 1990) and others (above) insisted that
the source was Sem. *rm% and the met. of Eg. mr% < *rm% had been completed
in Eg. Strangely, W. Helck (1989, 134, §4) left the dilemma, whether LEg. mr%
(GW!) was borrowed from a common Sem. root or vice versa, open! C. H. Gordon,
G. Roquet, and others (above), in turn, explained Eg. mr% to have been borrowed
from the metathetic Ug. re#ex (or from a dialect close to it), where the stem *mur%
developed from the common Sem. *rum%-. P. Behrens (1987) has quoted further
convincing cases of an Eg. < Ug. borrowing. It is, however, risky to agree with
R. M. Voigt (1989, 91–92, #2) and D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, l.c.) in
that the original form was preserved by Ug. mr% and all the other Sem. cognates
suffered an early met., all the more because its rendering is far from unambiguous
(cf. Heltzer 1978, 27; Watson 2002, 924 & fn. 35).
nb2: As pointed out by M. Cohen (1947, #425) and W. Vycichl (1990, 101), the
same word (with the same metathesis as in Ug. mr%) survives also in NBrb.: Shilh
ta-mur-t “lance, canne ferrée, épieu” [ Jordan apud Vcl.], Sus ta-m$r-t “lance, épieu”
[Chn.], which may be derived from an etymon *ta-mur%-at [Vcl.]. A borrowing
(Brb. < NWSem. via Punic) seems fairly possible (for Punic in#uence on Brb. cf.
Vcl. 1952). Surprisingly, W. G. E. Watson (2000, 570, §23) assumed Ug. mr% to
have come from Brb. (!), although, as rightly stressed by Vycichl (l.c.), “. . . le berbère
connaît pas le son %A– sauf dans les mots arabes . . .”.
nb3: There may be a further (genetic, not borrowed) cognate to the Eg.-Ug. isogloss:
Bed. malk"a (fem.!) “spear” [Hds. 1996 MS, 93]. Bed. -l- < Cu. *-r- is irreg. But Bed.
-k# < AA *-% seems plausible, cf. Bed. m5lak “salt” ~ Sem. *mil%- “salt”.
nb4: Sem. *rm% may be eventually akin to WCh.: Bade rúum-Ön “Kriegslanze”
[Lks. 1968, 223] (from Ar.?) !! ECh.: Ngam rám “jeter, lancer (pierre), tirer (fusil)”
& Mobu rame “lancer” [Lenssen 1984, 72].
nb5: V. É. Orel (1986, 62) observed the traces of Sem. *rum%- “Lanze” borrowed
into the ancient Balcanic languages, cf., e.g., Thracian b92R1) “lance”, perhaps also
“arrow” (and hence “lightning” in Bulgarian and Albanian), usually compared with
OInd. rambhá- (m) “a prop, staff, support” or with Lat. rump. “to tear, break” ~
OInd. lup- (impf. lumpati) “to break, take away etc.” (rejected by Orel for phono
logical reasons).
! Other etymologies cannot be accepted.
nb: The Eg. etymology in Goodwin 1867, 86 is absurd. L. Reinisch (1873, 213, fn. 3)
combined Eg. mr% with Tigre bal0 as well as numerous phonologically absurd
African comparanda. Later, he (Rn. 1887, 78) equated it with Bilin balá% and SA
maháU. (-*-) “Spieß, kurze Lanze”.

may stem, besides, Eg. mr0.t “Denkstein” (1x in 1st IMP, ÄWb I 548).

may have been indeed employed also as name of clepsydre. D. Meeks (AL 77.1795)
carefully avoided this comparison. W. Vycichl (DELC 121), in turn, considered it as
“moins probable”. Moreover, J. ,erný (CED 89), W. Westendorf (KHW), and W. Vycichl

nb: There is no agreement in the lit. concerning the etymology of the underlying
Eg. root: (1) at the present, most probable seems the cognacy with Bed. erh- “sehen,

Ammar’ar reh- ~ rh- “to see (-3(0*.)” [Dlg.], Bisharin r1h- ~ rh- “to see” [Almkvist]

The Eg.-Bed. comparison has long been known, cf. Hommel 1894, 357; Rn. 1895,
29; Zhl. 1932–33, 169; Vcl. 1934, 46, 77; 1938, 134; Dlg. 1973, 170; OS 1992,
176. See Mnh. 1912, 238 (Hausa-Cu.); Chn. 1947, #46 (Eg.-Cu.); Zbr. 1989, 587
(Bed.-ECu.); Takács 2005, 210; 2006, 118, fn. 60 & 125–6 (Bed.-Agaw-Eg.). Because
of the lack of *«-, the Agaw-LECu. isogloss can hardly be compared with Eg. «rq
“1. klug, verständig sein, 2. verstehen, kennen” (MK, Wb I 212, 10–15) as often
proposed (Rn. 1884, 341; Vrg. 1945, 137, #10.b.6; Chn. 1947, #45; OS 1992, 178;
440 mr"nn



Orel 1995, 104, #62; HSED #1074). (2) In principle, Eg. r0 (if < AA *l-X) might
be alternatively combined with HECu. *la=- [Hds.] > Drs. la=- “to hear, know”,
Hdy. la"- “to know”, Sid. la"- “to see, know” (HECu.: Hds. 1989, 87), which seems
unlikely due to Cpt. -r-. (3) Its comparison with Sem. *r"y “to see” (suggested in
Erman 1892, 114; Chn. 1947, #415) is out of question (Eg. -0 & Sem. *-"-). (4)
The same pertains to the equation with Sem. *rw% “to smell” (Ember 1926, 304,
#1) due to both phonological and semantical dif"culties. (5) F. Behnk (1927, 82,
#23) and O. Rössler (1966, 228) equated Eg. r0 with Sem. *yd« “to know” although
Eg. r- vs. Sem. *-d- and Eg. -0 vs. Sem. *-«, resp., are not regular. W.F. Albright
(1927, 203) rightly called this comparison “dangerous”. (6) E. Zyhlarz (1934, 113):
Eg. r0 ~ NBrb.: Zayan 35 “können”. Improbable (Zayan can hardly derive from
*r35 < *r-0-y). (7) Th. Schneider’s (1997, 200, #54) surprising equation with Hbr.
l«« “stammeln, irre reden”, Ar. l3w “to chat, talk nonsense”, Tigre l«l« “to speak
in an animated way” (!) is semantically absurd and certainly false. In addition, this
Sem. root has long been correctly identi"ed with Eg. 3«« [reg. < *l33] “1. to gibber,
2. speak a foreign language” (late NK, DLE I 2), for Eg.-Sem. see Calice 1931, 36;

Hence: mrs.w “vessel in which mrs was carried” (late NK, XX., Ward) = “name of a container in which mrsw is kept or served, quite a small vessel, prob. a cup rather than a container for must” ( Janssen 1975, 428–9) = “nom d’un pot de cuivre” (AC 1978, 14 with lit.) = “pot (dans lequel on conservait le moût)” (AL 78.1798, 79.1281) = “cup” (DLE I 229) = “(in a list of metal vessels)” (Hoch 1994, 141, §184) = “(kleines) Gefäß (offenbar für Weinmost)” (GHWb 350) = “Art Kupfertopf ” (WD II 65).
nb: Vocalized *marî2u (Hoch). Surprisingly, J. J. Janssen (1975, 428–9, §163), followed
by J. Hoch (1994, 141, §184), was disposed to trace back (B) maures, maurhs,
maris (fem.!) “jug, jar” (CD 183a) = “vessel” ( Janssen) = “Krug, Gefäß” (KHW
100) = “(water) jug” (Hoch) to NK mrs.w (ignoring the former’s derivation from Gk.
25(&7 “measure for liquids of 6 cotylae” suggested, e.g., in KHW 100; CED 89).
! Borrowed from Sem. The proper source has been disputed:
mr#.t – mrs.w 441



" 1. W. F. Albright (1918, 250–1, #107), F. von Calice (1936, #415), J. Hoch (1994, 140–1, #183), and C. Peust (1999, 307) assume Eg. mrs.w to have been borrowed from Old Canaanite (Alb.: “Sem. *mêrîš ”), cf. (?) Akk. mêrisu ~ mêrištu “must” [Alb. after Luckenbill, AJSL 23, 293, not in AHW] !! Ug. mr2 “perhaps a wine product” [Gordon 1955, 292, #1171] = “new wine” [Hoch 1994, 141, fn. 59 after Gibson] = “must” [DUL 579; Watson 1996, 548 with lit.] = “vin nouveau (?)” [DRS] (not so in WUS!), JAram. (TTM) m1ri/at “Most, ungegorener Wein” [Levy 1924 III, 107] = (Targum) m1yrat ~ m/r5t “fresh unfermented grape juice” [Rabin 1963, 137–8] = (Talmud) m1rat ~ m2r1t “must, juice” [Hoch], Syr. merît. [Brk.] = mer5t3 “new wine” [Dahood] = mer5t3 “must” [Hoch]. The Cpt.Sem. parallel had been identi"ed much earlier than the Sem.-Eg. one (cf. Dévaud 1921, 168, fn. 6). Seems to be the most convincing solution both semantically and phonologically.
nb1: Ug. mr2 has been alternatively rendered “legacy, i.e., inherited farm or estate”
< *wr2 “to inherit” (Dijkstra, UF 19, 1987, 47–48; cf. Watson 1999, 789, §27,
fn. 29).
nb2: The origin of the NWSem. word is disputed. (1) Formerly, it was usually
derived from the hypothetic Sem. *wr2 “to press out, deprive” [Alb.] = “auspressen”
[Clc.] based on Ebl. /war52u(m)/ [Conti] !! Hbr. yrš II qal “keltern, auspressen”
[Loretz 1977, 353–4, with further lit., after Haupt, AJSL 26, 1909–10, 215, 223;
Köhler, ZAW 46, 1928, 218–220] = “to tread (down), press (wine)” [KB 442, 1727]
= “presser (?) (ou aussi: fouler aux pieds)” [DRS 638–9] | Ar. war2- “what is fresh,
juicy, or moist (of things)” [Lane 2934] = “ce qui est frais, juteux, humide” [DRS]
as well as the supposed etymological connection to the alleged *t- pre"x derivatives
of the same root, cf. Ug. tr2 “ wine” [Gordon 1955, 334, #1979; Dahood 1965,
65, #1558; Rabin 1963, 137] (not listed in WUS 329!), Phn. trš “must” [Hoch],
Hbr. t5r.š (mainly as poetic parallel to yayin) “Most, ungegorener Wein” [GB 877]
= “sweet wine, must” [KB 1728] = “wine” (sic) [Rabin 1963, 137 & fn. 3 with
further lit.] = “moût de raisin non fermenté” [DRS] = “must, new wine” [Watson]
(supported by GB 877; Gordon 1955, 292, #1171; 1978, 52; Dahood 1965, 65,
§1558; DL in UF 10, 1978, 426; Hoch 1994, 140–1, §183; Watson 1999, 789, §27;
DRS 638–9; DUL 579). M. Görg (l.c.) even tried to link Sem. *wr2 II “to press” to
*wr2 “to inherit” assuming a semantic shift “to take into one’s possession by force”
> “to drive out” > “to press out”, which is very weak. The existence of Hbr. *yrš
(and Ug.*yr2) has been queried by several authors (Loretz 1977, 353–4; KB 1727).
(2) Recently, however, the mutual connection (and even the Sem. origin) of the
forms with initial *m- vs. *t- has been queried (cf. KB 1727). Thus, Ug. mr2 has
been alternatively af"liated (as a tricons. root with m- as part of it) with Ar. mr2
(var. to mr3, mrs) discussed below (see Köhler, ZAW 46, 1928, 219f.; Rabin 1963,
137–8; Loretz 1977, 353–4; DRS 639; KB 442). W. A. Ward (1961, 40, #27)
compared Ug. mr2 with Akk. mrs. Note that Akk. s does not regularly correspond
to Ug. 2 < PSem. *2 (yielding Akk. š). Therefore, Ug. mr2 and Akk. mrs cannot be
directly etymologically related. On the other hand, some authors have identi"ed
the NWSem. *t- pre"x forms with Hrgl. Luwian tuwarsa- “grape wine” and Gk.
EF(?97 “wreathed staff of Bacchantes” as Old Mediterranean Kulturwörter (Rabin in
Or. NS 32, 1963, 137, §20; Brown 1969, 168–170; Görg 1979, 7–10; Watson 1999,
789, §27; 2000 MS, 4, §38; KB 1727; DUL 579), but there is no agreement on the
way of borrowing. Thus, e.g., Ch. Rabin (followed by J. P. Brown, M. Görg, and
442 mrs.w



KB) suggested Ug. < Hitt. (vigorously declining the inner Sem. derivation of the
former), while W. G. E. Watson (1999, 792, fn. 46) vacillated between Ug. > Hitt.
(labelled by him as “not impossible” with regard to Ug. mr2 < *wr2) and a reverse
direction of borrowing with hesitation.
nb3: C. H. Gordon (1978, 52) explained both Syr. m1r5t and Hbr. tarš5š “sea”
(which literally designates a colour, cf. the Gk. epithet of sea 9d"9e ~ 9d"Ge “wine
dark”) from NWSem. *yr2, which he erroneously ultimately af"liated with Cpt. (S)
trovrev “rot sein, werden” (KHW 245), the underlying Eg. root being dšr. Note
that W. F. Albright (BASOR 83, 1941, 21) saw in Hbr. tarš5š a taq95l of )ršš (lit.
“smelting plant, furnace”).
" 2. O. Rössler (1971, 314) and W. Vycichl (1983, 120), in turn, identi"ed Eg. mrs.w with Eg. Ar. mar5s-a(t) “espèce de bière” [Dozy II 581] = “Dattelwein” [Rsl.] = “Sudanese beer, zythum” [Elias quoted by Vcl.] = “date-wine, barley-wine, zythum” [Ishaq 1991, 115, §xi.6] = “barley wine, a type of beer” [Hoch], cf. also Palest. Ar. mer5se “cake made from sour milk thickened by heat and dissolved in water” [Rabin 1963, 137–8 after Denizeau], Dathina mar5s-at “bière” [GD 2687]. These are treated by them seemingly as cognates. From Sudan Ar. mar5s-a(t) [Rn.] = “kind of beer” [Ishaq] were probably borrowed Bed. merñsa (f ) “Bier” [Rn.] = meriss!a “fermented drink
made from durra” [Hds. 1996 MS, 95] as well as Nub. mers3 ~ -1 [Rn.] (sic). E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 245) equated Eg. mrs.w directly with Nile Nub. mer5sa “Dattelwein, Durrabier” [Zhl.] = “bière faite de doura ou de doura et de dattes” [Massenbach quoted by Vcl.] = mer5sa “must, beer” [Peust 1999, 307]. The Eg.-Ar. etymology has been "rmly rejected by J. Hoch (1994, 141).
nb1: The Ar. word derives eventually from Sem. *mrs, cf. Akk. mar3su “durchrühren”
[AHW 609] = mar3su “1. (SBab.) to stir into a liquid, 2. (NAss. < Aram.) squash”,
(LL) marsu “mixed (said of malt steeped for beer)”, (OBab.) mirsu (mersu, mirisu)
“a confection made of dates, oil, butter, etc. [CAD m1, 108, 269, 290] = mar3su

mrs.w 443



nb3: As mentioned above, several authors maintain the eventual etymological con
nection of Sem. *mrs & *mr2 to Ug. mr2. That is, Eg. Ar. mar5s-a(t) vs. Ug. mr2
etc., might ultimately be related.
nb4: R. Dozy (l.c.) sought the source of Ar. mar5s-at- in Eg. (!) with a false etymolgy:
“elle semble tirer son nom de la province dont il sera question dans l’article suivant, cf. mar5s-iyy
(les Coptes appellent la Haute Égypte marhs, ce qui est au midi)”. Naturally, (SBF) marhs
“Südbezirk” (KHW 166) < Eg. m3«-rsj + (S) mris < Eg. mrs.w.
nb5: M. W. F. Philippi (1875, 88) derived Ar. mrs, mrš, mr2 from bicons. Sem.
*mar- (sic) “streich/fen, straff/mm sein”. H. Möller (1911, 165) explained Ar. mr2
from *mr- based on false Sem. comparanda as well as IE *m-r- (sic) “zerreiben, weich

mrš “lichtrot (von der Farbe einer Art ‘Myrrhen’)” (GR, Wb II 113, 1) = “hellrot” (Ebbell 1938, 98) = “(être) rouge, roux” (AL 77.1797 after BIFAO 75, 1975, 381) = “rötlich” (NBÄ 641, n. 668 with further lit.; Snk. 1983, 224) = “light red” (PL 445).

Iversen (l.c.) too considered this equation “as uncertain and obscure”, although Eg. pnš (occasional var. of prš) occurs in a list of pigments at the expected place of mnš. Therefore, Iversen was disposed to state that “. . . in spite of the linguistic dif!culties which cannot be

nb: J. R. Harris (1961, 147) identi"ed the rare pnš (in Ostr. Strassburg H.41) as an
error for mnš.t.
" 3. J. Osing (NBÄ 149) and W. Schenkel (1983, 224) explained it via met. from an unattested Eg. *mšr (sic). Baseless. " 4. W. Vycichl (DELC 121) pondered a comparison with Ar. wars“plante tinctoriale appelée Memecylon tinctorium, pour teindre en jaune, bonne pour faire disparaître les taches de rousseur”, war5s“teint en jaune” [BK II 1519]. " 5. GT: a relationship to ES: Geez malasa “to gleam, shine, glitter, #ash, sparkle, be polished etc.” [Lsl. 1987, 345] should not be ruled out either.
nb: However, the underlying Sem. root (attested in Ar., ES) signi"ed “to be smooth”.
" 7. L. Reinisch (1873, 90) set up a root *mš (!) compared with Teda mado, wada “rot”. Absurd.
mrq#.t (GW) “?” (late NK, Wb II 113, 2) = “#ight (?)” (MDAIK 16, 110, n. 12) = “Beute” (Helck 1962, 560, #100) = “to melt away (?)” (DLE I 229) = “to yield” (AEL II 65) = “booty” (Sivan & CochaviRainey 1992, 80) = “to #ee, #ight, retreat” (Hoch 1994, 142–3, §185) = “*wegschmelzen (in der Flucht)” (GHWb 350). ! Apparently a Sem. loan-word, but its source is uncertain. " 1. Traditionally af"liated with Hbr. malq.a% “Beute” < Sem. *l=%, which, in J. Hoch’s (l.c.) view, “should be dismissed”, since the dets. of Eg. mrq%t show a motion and its context requires a mng. like “to #ee”.
lit.: the Eg.-Hbr. etymology was suggested L. Burchardt (1909–10, #480) followed
by W. F. Albright (cf. Hoch l.c.), W. Helck (1962, 560, #100; 1971, 513, #100), and
D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 12, #1.2.1.1 & p. 17, #1.2.2.2).
" 2. J. Hoch (1994, 142–3, §185) preferred an equation with an mpre"x re#ex of Sem. *r%= “to be far” (with met.), cf. esp. Syr. r2%iq “to depart”, Geez r2%qa “to be far off, depart, withdraw, recoil”.
nb: As a “less likely” alternative, Hoch (l.c.) compared Ar. mul3%aqa “to pursuit,
chase” < la%iqa “to catch up, overtake”.
mrq&n (GW) “?” (middle of XX., Ostr. DeM 434, 2:7, Janssen 1975, 325, §95) = “un outil” (AC 1978, 14; AL 78.1799; 79.1283) = “a metal tool” (DLE I 229; Hoch 1994, 143).
nb1: Written as ma-r-qi2-di4-na vocalized as *mar/lqizina (?) (Hoch).
nb2: J. J. Janssen (l.c., fn. 72) excluded a miswriting for qr3n, and compared also
m3rn in the Libyan war inscription of Merneptah (l. 61, i.e., KRI IV 9:9).
! As rightly stated by J. J. Janssen (l.c.), it is apparently a Sem. borrowing (extended with m- pre"x of nomina instr.), but the underlying root is
mrq".t – mrq!n 445



uncertain. J. Hoch (1994, 143, §186) suggested two possible sources, namely (1) Sem. *gzr “to cut” (hence: Hbr. *magz1r3 “axe”, JAram. migz2r3 “cutting tool, pruning knife” ~ (met.) marg2zayy3 pl. “meat choppers, mincing knives”) vs. (2) Sem. *zlg > Hbr. mazl1g “(threeprongd) meat-fork”, MHbr. mazl1g ~ (met.) malg1z “fork (used in cooking)”, cf. Akk. mazlagu “fork (in list before spoon)”.
mrk “Geschenk” (XX–XXI., Wb II 113, 3) = “cadeau, présent” (RT 21, 1899, 86) = “Königsgeschenk” (W. M. Müller) = “Königsgabe” (Erman, Ranke, Hintze) = “tribute” (Breasted) = “royal gift” (Wilson) = “coronation gifts” (Gdk.) = “cadeau, offrande” (AL 78.1801 after Couroyer, RB 85, 1978, 584, n. 54) = “gift” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 80) = “gifts” (Hoch).
nb1: Attested acc. to Wb in Wenamun 2:11–12 and Pap. Chester Beatty I vs. B31.
The ex. in Pap. Wilbour A35:23 suggested by A. H. Gardiner (1948–52 III 37 & IV
75) and W. Helck (1962, 560) is in fact a TN and was henceforth declined M. Görg
(1974, 13) and H. Goedicke (1975, 137, n. 101). B. Couroyer (1963, 173) excluded
even the Pap. Chester Beatty ex., representing in his view “sans doute” just a variation
of brk. J. Hoch (1994, 104) added two further exx. expanding the time limits of the
attestation: KRI II 246:13 (XIX.) and Pap. Berlin 23252 vs. 2:8 (XXII.).
nb2: Written in GW as ma-l-kú (Helck, Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey).
! From the same root: mrk “offrir, présenter” (AL 78.1800 after Couroyer l.c. and Alliot 1954 II, 796, n. 4) = “opfern” (GR Edfu, Kurth 1994, 13, §53). ! Apparently a loan, but the source of borrowing is highly debated (cf. also Galán 1997, 43, fn. 48). " 1. A. H. Gardiner (1931, 42, n. 1), J. H. Breasted (ARE 1927 IV 282, §577, n. a), B. Couroyer (1963, 170, 173, 176–7, also in RB 66, 1959, 591–4), G. Vittmann (1975), and J. Hoch (1994, 104–6, §129 & p. 145, §188) considered it merely as a var. of NK brk (GW) “Geschenk, Gabe” (Wb I 466, 10; cf. Galán 1997, 41–43) < Hbr. b2r3k3 with the “strange” (Grd.) interchange of m- ~ b-. Rejected by M. Görg (1974, 14), since Sem. *brk was re#ected as Eg. brk. " 2. Many other authors, in turn, explained it eventually from Can. *malk- “king”, cf. Hbr. melek “1. König, 2. Königsgabe” (sic) [Helck].

(1971, 514, #101), H. Goedicke (1975, 79, 137 & fn. 99–100 with lit.).
nb: Albright assumed a false Can. (sic) etymon *mulku (sic) “royalty, dominion”.
" 3. M. Görg (1974, 18), rejecting the derivation from both NWSem. *brk and *mlk, explained it from Akk. mul$gu “eine Art von Mitgift” [AHW 671], Ug. mlg “dowry” [Gordon 1965, 433, #1480, not listed in WUS]. Rejected by G. Vittmann (1975).
446 mrk



" 4. G. Vittmann (1975, 45) pondered whether its source was a Can. form close to Punic mlk “Darbringung, Opfer” [Donner & Röllig] representing the “Verbalnomen zum Jiphil von hlk”. But ultimately he also agreed with the old view that Eg. mrk was purely a var. to brk.
mrkb.t (GW) “Streitwagen” (late NK, Wb II 113, 4) = “chariot” ( Janssen 1975, 329, §100; Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 81) > Cpt. (S) brCoout, bereCwout, (B) bereCwouts (f ) “Wagen” (KHW 27) = “char voiture” (DELC 31).
nb1: Its earliest ex. dates back to Dyn. XVIII (Karnak stela of Amenhotep II,
Urk. IV 1311:12), cf. Helck 1971, 514, #102; Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 35,
§2.1.3.2.2.
nb2: Consistently written in the GW with the syllabic group -bu-. Vocalized as
*markábata, pl. *markabãta (Hoch).
nb3: The shift of m- > Cpt. *b- may be due to the proximity of r ~ l in the root
(Peust 1999, 167).
! Borrowed from the Can. re#ex of Sem. *ma-rkab-(a)t- (nomen instr.) < Sem. *rkb “to ride” [SED I 317], cf. Hbr. merk3b3 “Wagen, bes.: 1. Kriegswagen, 2. Sonnwagen (im Kultus), 3. Cherubwagen” [GB], JAram. markabt3 [GB].

nb: Represents a ghost-word erroneously handled in DLE as a new gloss. It is, in

Hardly possible because of the consistent wtg. of MK mh.wt vs. h3.w without vs. with -3-, resp. This false etymology was carefully (and rightly) abandoned by W. Vycichl (DELC 131) who also assumed a m- pre"x in mhw.t as “probable” but avoided to reconstruct more than *mhwX.t/*mhXw.t.

Ward (1969, 265; 1977, 283–4, §7) rendered Eg. mhw.t “speech, words” as an m- pre"x form deriving from a hypothetic common Eg.-Sem. *hwy “to speak” [Ward] attested – in his view in Akk. awû(m) “sprechen” (AHW: denom.!), aw3tu [*hawy-at-?] “1. Wort, 2. Angelegenheit” [AHW 89, 91] = awû(m) “plaider”, aw3tu “1. mot, message, nouvelle, 2. ordre, décision, 3. procès, 4. chose, affaire” [DRS], Mari "à-wa-tum /hawatum/ [Gelb] !! Ug. hw-t (fem.)

“word” [Gordon 1955, 258, #548] = “Äußerung” [WUS #820] = “exhaled breath” [Margalit, RB 91, 1984, 113f.; ZAW 99, 1987, 394] = “mot” [DRS] = “1. word, statement, 2. matter, assignment (?)” [DUL 349] (Sem.: DRS 386; DUL 349) as well as in an obscure OT form.
nb1: The commonly accepted rendering and etymology of OT Hbr. haww.t
(fem. pl.) “words” (sic) [Ward] used by Ward in his comparison is fully different.
In the view of R. M. Voigt (p.c., 19 Dec. 2006), here “könnte vielleicht hawwôt in der
Bedeutung ‘Drohungen’, gebraucht mit dem Verb dabber in Ps. 38:13, gemeint sein”, but “die
Grundbedeutung von hawwôt ist ‘Verderben’ (von der Wurzel für ‘fallen’)”. Thus, Sem. *hwy
“to speak” is probably baseless.
nb2: It is, however, impossible to agree with Ward in relating this hopeful Eg.
Sem. isogloss with several further Eg.-Sem. roots, which are clearly distinct: (1)
Eg. hwt “jammern, klagen, schreien (?)” (BD, Wb II 485, 2–3; GHWb 490), in
which -t is part of the root and which occurs already in CT IV 160a–b, rendered
as “to shout” (Ward 1969) = “to speak” (Ward 1977), has been rightly connected
by Ward (1969, 265, fn. 4) with Sem. *hwt, cf. Hbr. hwt “anfahren, einstürmen
auf ” [GB 178] = “to attack” [KB 243] | Ar. hawwata (Damascus) “anschreien,
drohen” [GB] = “anschreien” [WUS] = “to shout at” [KB]. Cf. also Sem. *htt:
Hbr. htt “to overwhelm with reproofs” [KB 257] = “to shout” [Ward] | Ar. hatta
“to damage s’one’s reputation” [KB] = hatta l-kal3ma “to speak continuously”,
hatt3t- “one who speaks continuously or eloquently” [Ward]. The erroneous com
parison of Sem. *hwy with Ar. hwt has been proposed also in WUS #820. For the
same reasons, Ug. hw-t and Akk. aw3tu are similarly unrelated to Eg. hwt (contra
F. Calice quoted in Albright 1937–39, 71). (2) Hbr. nhh qal “to lament” [KB 675]
!!! Eg. hh “klagen, jammern” (GR: old text, Wb II 502, 9), cf. Ward 1969, 267 for
a new Dyn. XXI occurence. (3) Ward is mistaken also in af"liating Eg.-Sem. *hwy,
*hwt, *(n)hh with Eg. hhj “to deafen” (late NK, DLE I 88) and (4) Sem. *hwy “to
desire” (contra WUS l.c.).
nb3: Note that Akk. amû < awû “sprechen” [AHW] cannot have anything in com
mon with Geez %amäyä “to speak ill of ” etc. as W. Leslau (1944, 55–56) falsely
conjectured. As for Eth.-Sem. *%my, cp. rather ECu. *%am-/*%um- “bad” [Sasse
1979, 38; Heine 1978, 64] !!! (?) Eg. %m.t “Unglück, Übel” (GR, Wb III 80, 12).
" 2. G. Takács (1999, 144): if Eg. mh.wt displays the same semantic development as Eg. r “mouth” > “speech, utterance” (OK, FD 145) does, it is unavoidable to remark the parallelism with NBrb.: Wargla i-mi “dire” [Prv.], Wed Righ i-mi “dire” [Bst./Wlf.], Sened e-mma (iu-mma) “dire” [Wlf.] !!

NAgaw (< ES): Qemant mo “glass, cup” [Lsl.] !!! SOm.: Dime maye [Flm.] = mãy! [Sbr.] “pot” [Bnd. 1996 MS, 1, #68]?
nb: The Sem. etymology of the ES word is uncertain. (1) F. Praetorius (1879, 54)
af"liated it with Amh. w2ha “water”. (2) Th. Nöldeke (1910, 170 after Gesenius), in
turn, combined it with Ar. mah3-t- “crystal” (which, in turn, eventual comes from
the word for “water”). (3) This was received rather reluctantly by W. Leslau (l.c.),
who (Lsl. 1963, 106) assumed instead a connection with Harari mä%awa “object,
goods, utensil”.
*mh.w (?) > OCpt. mHau (m) “Hitze, Fieber” (KHW 523). ! Explained by J. Osing (1976, 76; NBÄ 107) from Eg. hm “heiß sein” (XVIII. Mag., Wb II 489, 15) via metathesis.
mhj.t “Milchkuh” (hapax: PT 550a, Wb II 113, 16; ÄWb I 548).
nb: The -r of the rare GR mhr “Milchkuh” (Esna hapax, Wb II 115, 17) may
be due to the in#uence (via contamination) of mhr “melken, Milch saugen oder
geben, säugen” (GR, Wb II 115, 9–16) and can thus hardly be a serious argument
for reconstructing an old etymon *mhr.t. Parallel to the well known -r > -j process,
there was a tendency of a “false archaisation” already in the MK, where etymo
logically correct "nal -j was hypercorrected into -r which in fact never existed in
the root (as pointed out by Müller 1909; Schenkel 1965; Vycichl 1983, 29). There
is no convincing evidence for assuming in PT mhj.t a development from an early
OK *mhr.t.
! Etymology debated: " 1. F. von Calice (GÄSW #636) assumed an etymological connection with LEg. mhr “melken” (GR, Wb, q.v.) < mhr “Milchkrug” (MK, Wb II 115, 5). Unlikely for the reasons outlined above. " 2. A. Ember (1913, 110, #3; 1930, §10.a.20, §13.a.5; quoted also in GÄSW #636) af"liated it with Ar. mah3-t- [< *mahaw-t-], pl. mahaw-3t- ~ mahay-3t- “vache sauvage ou antilope” [BK II 1164] = “(semble être) une espèce de buf#e” [Daumas: Sahara apud Dozy] = “une antilope du genreappelé meha” [Daumas: Ghadamès in Dozy II 622] = “wild cow” [Ember], cf. also Dathina mah3 “vache sauvage, antilope” [GD 2727], which represent a plausible cognate.
nb: The Ar. term is formally listed under Ar. mhw: mah3 “être d’un beau et brillant
pelage blanc (se dit d’une vache sauvage, d’une antilope)” [BK] in the lexicon, but
this is hardly a convincing etymology (denominal verb?).

in the light of Ar. "mh to Sem. bicons. *mh- “to forget (?)” [GT]. But Ug. mhy has
been rendered variously as demonstrated in Watson (1999, 789, fn. 28) and DUL
537, which hinders the Eg.-Ug. etymology, cf. (1) “abyss” [Hvidberg 1962, 28, fn. 3]
vs. “lowland” [De Moor 1987, 217; De Moor & Spronk 1987, 149], (2) “meadow,

“vergessen (?)”, Gt “nachläßig sein (?)” [Ebeling 1915, 1461] is out of question
(Eg. -h- + Sem. *-k-), cf. Eg. mk%3. (4) Sem. *mhh is far too remote semantically,
cf. Hbr. mhh or mhmh hitpalpel “zögern, zaudern” [GB 402] = mhh “to hesitate,
tarry, delay” [KB 552] = “weigern, verneinen” [Drexel 1925, 21] | Ar. mahah
“Verzug, Langsamkeit des Ganges” [GB] = “slow, ambling pace” [KB]. A. Drexel
(l.c.) considered Hbr. mah (sic) to be of onomatopoetic origin. (5) A connection with
MSA: Hrs. mhn: máthen “not to know” [ Jns. 1977, 88] is also unlikely because of
the C3 with no match in Eg. and Agaw.
nb2: No convincing cognates in Brb. either. SBrb.: Hgr. mihi, pl. mihî-t-en “1. doute

Nslm. miši < SBrb. *)m-z-h1 [Prs. 1969, 79, #514].
nb3: L. Reinisch (l.c.), followed by F. von Calice (l.c.), erroneously combined the
Eg.-Agaw root also with Ar. fahiha “1. être faible, débile, 2. oublier” [BK II 640] !!!
LECu.: Saho biya-š-it “vergessen” [Rn.], Somali m.g “Trägheit, Faulheit, Nachlaßig

nb4: The cognacy of WCh.: Ron: DB nyây "à-mâh “vergessen” (cf. nyây “verän

*mam- “to forget” [Skn.] = *manw- (?) [GT] > Siri & Jmb. mama, Miya man-,
Mburku mamw-, Pa’a mbambur- (NBch.: Skn. 1977, 22), which are to be derived
rather from PCh. *m-n()- “to forget” [NM].
nb5: A remote connection to the Ch. root (perhaps *m-w-h?) for “drunken, intoxi
cated” (lit. *“confused”) is not to be ruled out, cf. WCh.: Hausa mààyéé “intoxication”
[Abr. 1962, 670] !! CCh.: Mofu môwPhP & Mboku m.PhPy i vã— “(s’en)ivre(r)” [Mch.

! Other etymologies cannot be accepted. " 1. In Egyptian philology (Ceugney 1880, 7; Grapow 1914, 26; Feichtner 1932, 220; Vycichl 1933, 179), it was traditionally derived from Eg. whj “entgehen, verfehlen” (Wb) with an m- pre"x, which Feichtner identi"ed with the AA pre"x *m- of reciprocity (Gegenseitigkeit) presuming Eg. *m-whj to originate from a literal signi"cation “‘der Gedanke’ und ‘der Denkende’ verfehlen einander”, in which “die zwei Subjektsbegriffe, ‘Vergessender’ und ‘Vergessenes’ in Wechselbeziehung stehen” (sic).
" 2. A. Ember (1913, 117, #65; 1930, #10.c.2, #13.c) and H. Holma (1919, 39) risked to combine Eg. mhj with Akk. mašû (Ass. maš3"um) D
“vergessen” [AHW 631] !! WSem. *nšy “to forget” [GT], but Eg. -h- + Sem. *-š-. This idea was correctly declined by F. Calice (1936, #635).

secondary inner Sem. innovation.
" 3. Ch. Ehret (1995, 304, #581) af"liated it with Ar. mhk “to enervate (by sexual intercourse)” and SCu. *mâh- “to be sterile” < AA

nb1: Cf. also mhw.t ~ mhwj (grain det.) “etwas Körniges (of"zinell verwendet)”

The same may hold true of mhj.wt (grain det.) “Art Frucht (zwischen Weihrauch

PL 448) a late trace of the same word, which D. Meeks (1999, 581) received with
scepsis (“me paraît des plus hasardeux”) being disposed to suppose that it “pourrait désigner
soit l’eau du godet soit le godet lui-même”).
! Exact mng. obscure. But what we have learnt about it seems to (be) corroborate(d by) the suggestion by W. W. Müller (1961, 202, #8) who identi"ed Eg. mhwj with the re#exes of Sem. *mhw “to (be) melt(ed)” [GT]. Especially the Ar. root is remarkable from a semantic viewpoint.

nb4: Th. Nöldeke (1910, 170) saw in Sem. *mhw a denom. derivative from the
common Sem. *may (sic) “water”. Similarly, A. Zaborski (1971, #139) treated both
Ar. mhw and mwh: m3ha “avoir beaucoup d’eau (se dit d’un puits)” [BK II 1169]
= “aquam multam habere (putens)” [Möller] = “to be abundant in water” [Zbr.]
as denom. verbs from Ar. m3"-, pl. "amw3h-. Accepting this for the case of Ar.,
W. Leslau, however, suggested a different etymology for Geez (where, in his view,
“the enlargement through -h- does not occur” and thus “this procedure does not apply”), cf.
Ar. mahha “traiter avec douceur, avec humanité (ses bestiaux, etc.)”, mahiha “être
doux” [BK II 1159]. H. Möller (1911, 169) erroneously treated Sem. *-h as a C3
root ext.
nb4: The cognacy of Ug. mhy-t is unlikely. It has been rendered and etymologized
very diversely (cf. Watson 2002, 798, §6): “rain” < )hyh expressing “l’idée de la
chute de la neige . . . ou de la pluie” [Badre et al., Syria 53, 1976, 121–2] = “meadow,
watered place, fertile land” < my “water” (!) [DLU 267].
nb5: Remotely related may be also Sem. *mhl, which seems to have a C3 root ext.
*-l, cf. Hbr. m3h$l “(vinum) castratum, verfälscht, schwach” [GB 403] = “watered
down, diluted (with the addition of water)” [KB 552], PB Hbr. m3hal “langsam
#ießen” > m.hal “1. Saft, das Flüßige, Ausgeschwitzte” [Levy 1924 III, 37] =
m.hal “broth with oil” [Löw/KB], JAram. mhl “to dilute wine with water” [KB],
JPAram. mhl “to dilute” [Sokoloff 1990, 294] | Ar. mahala “être lent, doux” >
muhl- “2. cuivre fondu, 3. huile ou marc d’huile, 4. goudron, pox liquide, 5. sanie

ZDMG 40, 741] = muhl- “fruit-juice”, mahl- “liquid asphalt” [KB].

mhwj ~ mhw.t 461



" 2. F. Jonckheere (1947, 16, fn. 2) separated its var. mh3w.t (in Pap. Ch. Beatty VI rt. 1:1–7) which he explained from Eg. h3j “descendre” with a pre"x m- (lit. “ce qui fait descendre”). " 3. W. Westendorf (1962, 35, §51.8) assumed in its var. mhn (Med. XIX., Wb II 115, 4) “eine mögliche Wiedergabe von” *mhl (contra Wb l.c.: “anscheinend irrig für mhwj”), on the basis of which he surmised an etymological connection to Eg. mhr ~ mhn ~ mhj “Milch(gefäß)” vs. “melken” (sic, q.v.) with an interchange of n ~ j ~ w ~ 3 (sic). P. Wilson (PL 448) had apparently a similar idea. False.
mhn “Art Kiste aus Holz” (late NK, Wb II 115, 1) = “Truhe” (Edel) = “chest, coffer” (AEO I 68, II 212*, #440) = “Kästchen, auch als Ausfuhr” (Helck MWNR 304) = “chest (made of wood)” (Wente 1967, 73, n. l) = “(may have been) a rather rough, though not too small chest (used for i.a. grain)” ( Janssen 1975, 207–8, §45) = “Kiste, Kasten” (NBÄ 322, 867–8, n. 1385) = “cof"n” (Smith 1979, 161) = “wooden chest” (DLE I 230).
nb1: Appears also in an Amarna cuneiform list of gifts (EA 14, 4:20–22 & 4:34) as
ma-0a-an “Gefäß aus uš$-Holz (hinter Gefäßen aus Elfenbein erwähnt)” [Ranke]
= “an ebony or, at least, wooden object: a type of wooden chest” [Lambdin 1953,
366, §17] = “Kasten, Truhe (aus Ebenholz)” [Edel 1988, 106–109, #5] = “a type
of wooden chest” [CAD m2, 50; Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1997, 99–100], which
had earlier been mistakenly explained by H. Ranke (KMAV 23) from NK mhn
“ein Gefäß” (Ranke) = “rare name of a vessel” (Lambdin) < mhr “Milchkrug”
(Wb, q.v.).

! Clearly (cf. Wb l.c.; NBÄ 322; Smith 1979, 161) an m- pre"x form derived from Eg. hn ~ var. hn.w “Kasten” (OK, Wb II 491–492) = “box, coffer, chest” (Smith 1987, 127–8), whose etymology is still unclear.
nb: V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED #1713) compared Eg. mhn with Akk. ma00alu
“ein Korb oder Kasten (?)”, cf. ma00altu “Sieb” [AHW 582], which is a grave
error for several reasons: i.a., (1) this is a nomen instr. (*ma-n0al-) of Akk. na03lu
“(durch)sieben” [AHW] (for which cf. rather Eg. nqr “to sieve”), (2) only the "rst
consonants correspond (Eg. -h- + Akk. -0- and Eg. -n proven by the Amarna evi
dence + Akk. -l either). Rejected by G. Takács (1997, 113, #1713; 1999, 112). For
further discussion of the Akk. word see Eg. m0jr (below).

Sauneron (l.c.) hesitated to explain it via pre"x m- from an Eg. simplex like hnj.t “une partie de la coloquinthe 33r.t” (Pap. Ebers 109:10) = “Art Schröpfkopf ” (WMT II 567), which “ne fournit pas guère de sens”. Instead, he was pondering whether it was a late NWSem. loan e.g. from Hbr. m2h-l3 “maladie, in"rmité”, whose sense is, however, too general.
mhr > var.

nb1: Not this word is re#ected in the Amarna letter EA 14, 4:20–22 & 4:34 (as
falsely suggested by H. Ranke, KMAV 23), cf. Edel 1988, 106, §5.
nb2: Attested once already in Dyn. VI (Cairo 43371 stela, cf. ASAE 17, 1917, 163
& Urk. I 254) and once in the 1st IMP (MDAIK 50, 1994, 73, pl. 9), cf. ÄWb I
548.
nb3: Determinated in the GR with the hrgl. W19 (phon. value mr > mj) rendered
“Milchtopf mit der Tragschlinge/Tragnetz” (Wb) = “milk-jug as carried in a net”
(EG 1927, 514) = “Jochgefäß” (Faltings 1998, 20 following P. Montet 1925, 259).
As pointed out by D. Faltings (l.c.), the det. of the MK ex. of mhr (from Meir)
was, however, not identical with the hrgl. W19 (as suggested by A. H. Gardiner in
EG 1927, 514) but depicted in fact “ein typischer, länglicher Milchtopf des AR, allerdings
ohne Grasbüschelverschluß”. M. Lichtheim (1947, 173 & fn. 33–34) admitted that mhr
could have occasionally denoted a situla (namely “a certain type of situla, the broad
shouldered, narrow-necked shape” that “is primarily a milk vessel because of its regular
appearence in the milk-sprinkling ceremony”), although the “support for this is not evident” (cf.
inscriptions of Thotmes III in Urk. IV 172:12, 743:15 contra Urk. III 123, “where
‘milk vessels of silver’ are listed twice, and in both cases the det. for mhn are not situlae”).

the Great) cf. Jasnow 1994, 107, n. v (with further lit.). The shift of NK mhn < MK
mhn.t – mhr 463



mhr has been explained by G. Fecht (1960, 9, fn. 25 & 26) with the “assimilatorische
Einwirkung von m- auf -rr-” (!), cf. Eg. mr-wr > mn-wr “Mnevis”, and also before n,
cf. npn.t “Getreidekorn” ~ npr “Getreide”.
! From the same root: (1) mhr “Melker” (late NK, Grapow 1914, 26; GHWb 351) = “milkman” (Grd. 1911, 20*, fn. 7; AEO I 64*).
nb: Cf. also mh3 (GW) “eine Personenbez.” (late NK, Wb II 44, 9) = “ein Beruf:
*Melker” (GHWb 326).
(2) mhr (denom.?) “1. melken, 2. Milch saugen, 3. Milch geben (Kuh), 4. säugen, ein Kind stillen (mit Milch, mit den Brüsten)” (GR, Wb II 115, 9–16; WD II 66: cf. RdE 7, 1950, 69, n. 9) = “to provide with milk” (Grd. 1911, 20*, fn. 7; cf. Piehl in Sphinx 4, 12–14) = “to suckle, milk” (PL 448). ! Etymology disputable. " 1. In Egyptian philology, traditionally derived as an m- pre"x form from the rare Eg. hr “melken” (late NK Mag. hapax, Wb II 498, 3; GHWb 495), whose existence has been doubted by P. Wilson (PL 448: “not attested”). Dubious also for NK mhn can hardly agree with Cpt. -r-.
lit.: Grapow (1914, 139 emphasizing his reservations); Gardiner (AEO I 64*); Smith
(1979, 161); Vycichl (DELC 307); Faltings (1998, 20, fn. 78).
nb: J. ,erný (CED 291) reaf"rmed the rendering of LEg. hr “to milk” with a
further late NK occurence: Horus & Seth 10:7 (“the meaning is certain”). R. Hannig
(ÄWb I 751), in addition, has two OK exx. from Dyn. V. This is supported also by
Cpt. (SB) Hwr “to squeeze out milk, milk” (CD 697b) = “melken” (KHW 385) =
“traire” (DELC 307). This Eg. root has only a semantically weak Sem. etymology
(offered by Albright 1918, 222, #1; Ember 1930, #12.a.30, 13.a.9), cf. Ar. hrr “to
#ow” and nhr (pre"x n-?) “to #ow”.
" 2. P. Langlois (1919, 161–2) assumed in NK mhr an “orthographie nouvelle” of OEg. mr “Topf für Milch” (PT, Wb, above). This derivation of MK mhr from the “obsolete” PT mr (late OK mj, cf. AÄG §30 & §128) was "rmly rejected by D. Faltings (1998, 20) as “zweifelhaft” wondering “wie sollte ein Lautwandel von mj (auch wenn es aus mr entstanden ist) zu mhr aussehen?”.
" 3. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 198; HSED #1709) supposed Eg. mhr to be cognate with WCh. *mwar- (sic) “to suck” [Stl.] based solely on Angas moor “to suck” [Flk.]. Uncertain especially because LEg. mhr “säugen” (Wb) seems a denom. verb), but not to be ruled out fully.
nb1: The underlying AS root was in fact *mo3or (var. *mu3ur in Msr.?) [GT 2004,
250]: its basic sense presumably refers to the (stirring?) movement of the jaw when
chewing and sucking. This original meaning “to stir (?)” has been preserved in Msr.
kam mukur [< *mu3ur] “stirring stick”, cf. ka tung ngwom ku kam mukur “you
stir the food with a stirring stick” (kam “stick”) [Dkl. 1997 MS]. Elsewhere, it is
attested with the sense (1) “to suck”, cf. Angas moor “to suck” [Flk. 1915, 246]
464 mhr



= mor “to eat” (so!) (- Hs. >áá “to drink”, Abr.) [ALC 1978, 39], Kfy. mogór “to

compared with Ar. mwr “s’agiter et aller çà et là (se dit de l’eau dont les vagues sont

nb: The long *-3- of PSam *m3l might be explained from an earlier (pre-PECu.)

nb1: Its duties and characteristics were summed up by Zorn (1991, 133) as follows

his travels, (3) a soldier equipped with a bow (the weapon of the chariotry), quiver,
and a knife, (4) could also lead troops, (5) equated with the maryannu or chariot
warriors, (6) expected to possess a broad geographical knowledge (major towns,
roads, passes, fords from the Eg. border to Hatti, the distances involved and the
dangers on the way. Rainey (1967, 58–60) discussed arguments against rendering
Eg. z> mhr (Pap. Anastasi I 18:4) as OT Hbr. s.per m3h5r “expert (swift) scribe”,
which he regards as an “all-too-simple equation” (suggesting that Can. *mahr “was some
type of soldier, perhaps the Sem. counterpart of maryannu”).
nb2: For a detailed list of the exx. of Eg. mhr with sources see Zorn (1991, 133–4,
fn. 35–48) and Hoch (1994, 147, §190).
nb3: Its child det. was borrowed from mhr “Säugling” (XIX., Wb, q.v.), cf. RT 18,
162; Grd. 1911, 20*, fn. 7. But both mhr terms may be etymologically distinct.
B. Couroyer (1964, 443f.) rightly rejected the derivation of Eg. mhr of this entry
from hr “to milk”.
nb4: The forms written in GW were vocalized by W. Helck (1971, 514, #103) as
*mah2r and by J. Hoch (l.c.) as *mah5ra, which A. F. Rainey (1998, 441–3, §190)
regarded as “baseless”. Similarly, G. Vittmann (l.c.) reconstructed Eg. *mahir. Instead,
Rainey (1967, 59; Israel Exploration Journal 19, 1969, 107) proposed (following W. F.
Albright) an original vocalisation *mahr > *mahar (with the added anaptyctic vowel)
re#ecting the pattern of Hbr. %3k3m “wise” or y3š3r “righteous”. Z. Cochavi-Rainey
& D. Sivan (1992, 81) reconstructed LEg. *mahar. H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (1986, 244)
too assumed a NWSem. etymon *mahr (sic). This might be in principle corroborated
by Amarna lúpa-ma-0a-a (EA 162, 74), for which various interpretations have been
proposed (e.g., Albright 1937, 200, n. 4: < p3 m%-jb “the commissioner”, for further
details cf. Eg. m%j.t), and which was recently identi"ed by J. Zorn (1991, 131–8)
as an Egyptianized form of NWSem. *mahar (pronounced in the 14th cent. BC as
*/maha/) + p3 (de"nite article), lit. “the soldier”. Zorn’s (1991, 133) assumption
that the -r in Eg. “at the end was no longer pronounced” and its writing was purely due
to a “frozen spelling in the traditional writing” is, however, not satisfactory (even when
one can easily agree with Z. Cochavi-Rainey 1997, 105–6 in that “the absence of the
!nal -r is easier to accept than the supposed absence of the !nal -b in Albright’s suggestion”),
since it could have been the case only when the NWSem. had been present in the
Eg. vocabulary for long centuries before the end of the 14th cent. BC (as supposed
by Zorn), which would be an anachronism, and if Eg. mhr had thus undergone
the same erosion process of OK -r > MK -j > late NK -Ø as the native Eg. words.
Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1997, 105–6) sees the proof of the "nal -j in question in the
wtg. of the LEg. PN mhrj (XX., cf. Ranke PN II 292:1), which, however, may be
rather a re#ection of OT PN mahray (one of David’s mighty men).
nb5: Attested also as mhrn (KRI III 370:4), cf. Meeks 1997, 41, §190.
nb6: LEg. mhr is supposed to have survived until the Ptol. and Roman times, when
it appeared in Edfu (I 180, I 203, IV 234) as mhr.w (pl.) “Bez. der Genossen des
Seth” (Wb II 116, 5) = “Seth and his associates” (PL 448) and in the Tebtunis
onomasticon (2nd cent. AD) as mhr.w (pl.) “die Feinde (in der Liste von verderben
bringenden Wesen, neben «p-Feinden usw.), als Bez. für die Genossen des Seth
(- 0ftj.w)” (Osing 1998, 100, n. d & fn. 458, p. 286–7, n. o & fn. 1354). As pointed
out by P. Wilson (PL), this shift of meaning of Eg. mhr applied to the allies of
Seth may have occured “either because of its military and !ghting associations or because it
represents a foreign soldier”.
! A NWSem. loan, cf. esp. Ug. mhr “serviceman, soldier” [Gordon] = “Dienstmann, Junker, Soldat” [WUS] = “soldier, young hero (?)” [Segert 1984, 191] = “hero’s vigor or courage” [Zorn 1991, 135–6], cf. Ug. mhr st “drunken soldier” [Ginsberg] = “ready in battle” [Driver] = “Sutean warrior” [Margalit] = “warrior of the Lady”



[Gibson] = “champion of (the Eg. god) St” (sic) [Grdseloff ] (for Ug. cf. Zorn 1991, 136; Watson 1993, 217 with further lit.) as well as Punic mhr “warrior” [Hoch] | OSA t-mhr-t “contingent of Bedouin mercenaries” [Lsl.] = “elite troops” [Hoch]. Ug. mhr may have properly meant “skilled, trained” (or the like), being cognate with Sem. *mhr “gewandt, erfahren” [WUS] = “to be skilled” [Ullendorff ].
lit. for Eg.-Sem.: Goodwin 1858, 267; Chabas 1866, 81–82; Grd. 1911, 20*, fn. 7;

561; Couroyer 1964, 443–453; Zorn 1991, 131–8; Hoch 1994, 147–149, #190.
nb1: For the wider Sem. relationship of the NWSem. term, cf., e.g., Hbr. m3h5r
“gewandt, geschickt” [GB] = “quick, skilled, expert, practised” [Ullendorff, VT 6,
1965, 195], Imp. Aram. mhyr “capable, skillful” [Lsl.], Syr. m2h5r3 “geschickt” [GB] =
“skill, knowledge” [Ullendorff ] = “trained, skillful” [Lsl.] | OSA mhr (part of PNs)
“(perhaps) skill, expertness” [Ullendorff ] = “Handwerker (?)” [Müller 1963, 311], Ar.
mahara “être habile dans qqch., savoir faire qqch. avec habileté” [BK II 1160–1]
= “begabt, tüchtig sein” [GB] = “to be skilled” [Lsl.] !! Eth.-Sem. *mhr “to teach”
[Lsl.] > i.a. Geez mahara ~ m2hra “üben, lehren” [GB] = “to teach, instruct,
educate, train, discipline” [Lsl.] (Sem.: Gordon 1955, 287, #1075; Ullendorff 1956,
195; WUS #1532; Lsl. 1987, 334; Hoch l.c.).
nb2: F. Chabas (quoted by Lauth l.c. and Gardiner l.c.: “very uncertain, but has not been
bettered”) and W. Helck (1971, 514, #103) explained Eg. mhr directly from Hbr. mhr
piel “1. eilen, 2. schnell bringen, schnell fertig machen”, m2h1r3 “Eile, Schnelligkeit”
[GB 403], although it is treated in GB as a distinct root akin to Ar. mhl II & V
“voranseilen”, mahal- “Vorangehen” [GB]. Still, in the light of the pun between
Eg. 3s “schnell” vs. mhr in Pap. Anastasi I 27:9 “wegen der Synonimität beider Wörter”
(Fischer-Elfert 1986, 234–5), there must have been an etymological connection to
Hbr. mhr piel “eilen”, which (along with rendering Eg. mhr as “courier”/“Eilbote”),
in spite of the pun, was "rmly denied by H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (1986, 244–5).
nb3: Ignoring the Sem. cognates of Ug. mhr “serviceman, soldier”, V. Orel &
O. Stolbova (HSED #1710) erroneously connected it with WCh.: Ron: Kulere mahor,
Daffo-Butura moor “slave” !! CCh.: Lame muhor “immigrant”. This false Ug.-Ch.
comparison has been rightly rejected by I. M. D’jakonoff & L. Kogan (1995 MS,
#1710). Besides, for Ron “slave” see Eg. mr.t above.
mhr (GW) “Kaufpreis” (XIX.: Pap. Anastasi I, Fischer-Elfert 1986, 213, 219–220) = “Brautpreis” (Quack 1996, 512). ! Explained by H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (l.c.) from Hbr. mohar “der Kaufpreis, den der Bräutigam an den Vater der Braut zahlte” [GB 403] = “bride-money, an indeminity for the bride’s family” [KB 554], cf. also Ar. mahr- “dot qu’on assure à la femme qu’on épouse” [BK II 1161] = “Morgengabe” [GVGSS I 194, §74]. His rendering was doubted by J.-F. Quack (l.c.): “im Kotext nicht zweifelsfrei”.
mhrn (GW) “praise” (XX. hapax: Ostr. DeM 429, 3, Hoch 1994, 149).
nb: Read by W. Helck (1962, 565, #158) as hrn (ha-ri-na), which, however, “makes
little sense” in Hoch’s view, who assumed *mahal3la.

Etymology debatable: " 1. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 53, 162), followed by W. Westendorf (KHW 111) saw in it a late loan from Bed. melhái “Kahlköp"gkeit” [Zhl.] = melh3y “calvitie” [Vcl.] = melhai (m) “1. scar due to abrasion, 2. baldness due to injury” [Hds. 1996 MS, 93] < lehi “abschälen, abrinden”, leh “kahl, abgerindet sein” [Rn. 1895, 156] = leh! “to be(come) bald (usually on top of head only)”, l2h!i (f ) “baldness” & “bald, tonsured” [Rpr. 1928, 211] = lehi “abschälen” [Zhl.] = lehi “peler” [Vcl.] = lehai “partially bald” [Hds. 1996 MS, 85]. Righly rejected by W. Vycichl (DELC).
nb: The Bed. root was )l-h-y, which stemmed from Ar. l%y: la%3 “1. enlever l’écorce
intérieure d’un arbre, d’un bois” [BK II 979] as a recent borrowing at a much
later date than that when a possible Bed. > Eg. borrowing could have at all taken
place. M. Vanhove (p.c., 18 Dec. 2006) con"rms that “it seems highly unlikely that any
borrowing from pre-classical Arabic could have taken place as early as 3rd cent. BC. There is no
mention I know of that refers to any particular (intense or loose) contact between the small bedouin
tribes of the Arabic peninsula and the forefathers of the Bejas”.

ex. of the ethnonym (cf. JEA 53, 1967, pl. xi) con"rming that the 7th hrgl. is in fact a

"3. F. Hommel (1904, 110, fn. 1) compared it with Akk. ma030u “aufquellen lassen, in Flüssigkeit au#ösen” [AHW 577]. False both semantically and phonologically (as a rule, Eg. % vs. Akk. 0 do not correspond).
nb: The Akk. root is perhaps connected with Syr. )m%%: "etm2%a% “zerstäubt

" 4. A.

peu d’eau pour remplir son seau, 2. tirer, prendre, puiser de l’eau, 7. se remplir la

" 7. A. R. Bomhard (1990, 376): ~ Geez m%s “to cause to grow, rear”. Incorrect. Semantically dubious. The Geez "nal -s has no match in Eg. " 8. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 199, #1781) derived Eg. m% “auslegen (mit Steinen, Glas#üssen usw.), eigtl.: füllen” (late MK, Wb II 119) = “to inlay” (FD 113) from AA *-ma/e%- “to stick into” based on untenable comparanda: Ar. m%z “to lie with” and NOm.: Zayse meh-et-s(-et- durative, -s- caus.) “to copulate”. " 9. GT: the idea (expressed e.g. in GM 114, 1990, 92) of its kinship with Sem. *ml" “to be full” has to be discarded.
nb: The evident phonological disagreement between Eg. -% vs. Sem. *-l" has to be
admitted in spite of the suspiciously similar (and unsolved) dilemma of comparative
Eg.-Sem. phonology represented by the apparent cognacy of Eg. sm%j “left (side,
hand)” (late NK, Wb IV 140; DLE III 53) with Sem. *Gm"l ~ *G"ml “left (hand)”
[WUS #2622] = *Ga"mal- [Frz. 1965, 265, #4.27] (Eg.-Sem. suggested by Erman

m# “Arm (gern neben «)” (PT, Wb II 120, 1) = “forearm” (FD 113)

nb: The Cpt. evidence speaks in both cases for a quadricons. word in Eg.: *m%j.w
or *m%«.w (!) (KHW 89, 110 & fn. 3) = *m'%C3'C4 (Vcl.) = perhaps *m%3.w

nb1: Without further Chadic and extra-Chadic data, it is hard to determine the
second root cons.
nb2: Is the supposed Eg.-Ch. isogloss ultimately related ES: Harari mi%i “vicinity,
near, beside”, 3n mi%iye-be “at my side” Grg.: Chaha & Gyeto & Masqan meyä
“rib”, Wolane miyamo “side of ribs” !! MSA: Sqt. mi«eh [irreg. -«-] “side” (Leslau
1963, 105)?
! Other suggestions are unconvincing: " 1. P. Lacau (1970, 107, #281) considered Eg. m% to be an m- pre"x form related to Akk. a0u “arm, side”. This is not well founded. W. A. Ward (1972, 22, §279–282) rightly declined Lacau’s idea.
nb: Eg. % does not regularly correspond to Akk. 0 (but cf. Kogan 1995). In addition,
the function of m- in this case has not been explained.
" 2. W. A. Ward (1972, 22, §279–282) derived Eg. m% “forearm” from m% “to seize, hold” (below). Improbable.
nb: A semantic connection between “"st” and “to grasp, seize” is understandable,
but this is not the case here.
" 3. L. Reinisch (1873, 246–7) combined it with Teda t5 ~ tihi “Ellbogen”, tumma ~ tu—ga “Hand” (!), which is absurd.
m# “fassen, packen” (NK, Wb II 119; ÄWb I 550: attested 1x already in VI.) = “to hold, seize, lay hold of (m), grasp, capture” (FD 113) > Dem. m% ~ (3)m%Ÿ (DG 5:4, 172:2) > Cpt. (S) amaHte, (A) emaHte, (B) amaHi, (F) meHi “to prevail, grasp” (CD 9a; CED 7).

" 2. Ch. Ehret (1995, #582) equated it with PCu. *m-/i%- “to attack, assail” (sic, Cu. re#exes not mentioned). Similarly, G.

strike hard with stick, clod, brick” [Mlt.-Stl.] !! ECh.: Migama múkkìyò “battre”
[ JA 1992, 108]. Lit. for this AA root: Mlt.-Stl. 1990, 71; HSED #1802.
nb2: Ehret (l.c.) compared also Ar. m%z “to strike the chest with "st” and m%n “to
beat” (Ehret: root extensions -z, -n).
" 3. GT: the etymological connection to HECu.: (?) Sidamo moh “to seize” [Lsl. 1944, 56] !!! CCh.: Bata mõ “accepter” [Mch.], Gude mu"u “to clench "st, close hand around sg.” [Hsk. 1983, 245] |
Musgu ma “accepter”, imã “saisir” [Lks./Mch.] | Musgoy may “accepter” [Mch.] (CCh.: Mch. 1950, 50, 54) would be semantically right, but the second root cons. in Ch. is obscure.
nb: In addition, the Sid. mng. was given only by W. Leslau (l.c.) referring to Cerulli
(1938 II, 213), who, however, glossed this word as “regnare” (which certainly rep
resents a distinct root surely unrelated with Eg. m%).
" 4. GT: Sem. *m%w “verschwinden, verlöschen, vertilgen” [Tropper] = “to efface” [GT] seems a plausible cognate to Eg. m%.

[Tropper] (suggested e.g. by J. Tropper 1995, 64 listing exx. for Akk. 0 < Sem. *%)

Cf. the Wortspiel with m%.w vs. m%j in PT 766d (ÜKAPT VI 133). In this case, the meaning “north” etc. would be an innovation.

" 2. K. Sethe (1899 I, §97.a & p. 34; ZÄS 44, 1907, 3, 13–14), in turn, followed by P. Wilson (PL 454), supposed an opposite way of derivation assuming Eg. m%.tj “nördlich” to be a secondary (orig. *m%w.tj, lit. “zum Nordwind gehörig”) form coming from Eg. m%w.t “Nordwind”, which would have to be regarded as a primary noun.

Although this scenario was a priori declined by J. Osing (NBÄ 857–8, n. 1328) as “hardly explainable”, W. Vycichl (DELC 130) ingeniously pointed out the striking identity of Eg. m%w.t “north-wind” with Ar. ma%w-at- “1. vent du nord, 2. pluie” [BK II 1071], which may, of course, be due to pure chance as well as well due to cognacy.
nb: I. D’jakonov & L. Kogan (1995, #1714) af"liated the Ar. word with Akk.
me0û “Sturm” [AHW 642] and derived both from Sem. *m%w “effacer, anéantir”
[Kogan], cf., e.g., Ar. m%w: ma%3 “effacer” [BK], which – as we have seen above
may probably be eventually akin to Eg. m% “to seize” (q.v.).
" 3. GT: taking into view that north in Egypt was in fact conceived as “ce qui est derrière”, which “d’après le système d’orientation des anciens Égyptiens est derrière lui, le Sud en face” (Lacau 1970, 11, fn. 1; 1913, 219, §453), the closeness of Eg. )m% to AA *m-[%] “1. back, 2. bottom” [GT] is also noteworthy.

nb: Ch. Ehret (l.c.) combined the Ma’a word with Irq. ma"aye “kind of medicine”
(explained from a certain SCu. *mâ"a- “bush, shrub, plant”), which is semantically
unconvincing.
! Other suggestions are either irreal or unlikely: " 5. W. Spiegelberg (1902, 180) explained the Eg. name of Delta (lit. “Flachsland”) from Eg. m%j (sic) “Flachs”. False, since the oldest form of the latter was m%« (q.v.).
" 6. Following A. Erman (1928 ÄG4, §128) and G. Lefébvre (1955 GEC, §160), P.

" 7. L. Homburger (1930, 253) af"liated it with Nub. kalo “Nord” (!). Absurd. " 8. G. R. Castellino (1984, 17–18) proposed a connection with Sum. immer (misquoted as immer) - Akk. išt3nu > ilt3nu “north(-wind)” [Labat 1976, 159, #347]. Evidently wrong. Naturally, Sum. mer and Eg. m%.w have nothing in common either semantically or phonologically.
nb: The original meaning of Sum. mer is totally different being translated by Akk.
ag3gu “êre en colère” and ezzu “furieux” [Labat], while IM (TU15) signi"es “wind”.
Sum. tu15/immer thus means actually “vent furieux”.
" 9. A. M. Lam (1993, 395) combined Eg. m%.w vs. t3-m%.w “Lower Egypt” with Ful (Pulaar) Hakke “boue” vs. to-Hakke “le pays de la boue” (sic) and also to-muh5 “le pays couvert de boue” (sic). Absurd.
nb: The quotation of the Ful(fulde) data is, besides, inexact (kind p.c. by H. Tour
neux, 22 Dec. 2006): to- may in no case be a Ful formative. It may be a conjunction
meaning “if ”. Anyhow, it is not clear what to Hakke could be, neither to-muh5.

nb1: P. Wilson’s (PL) both GR exx. (Edfu I 558:17, III 49:13) were rejected by
D. Meeks (1999, 581) as not convincing (with false rdg.).

moeiH, moiaH, maieH, (F) moeiaH, maiaH (masc.!) “1. a measure for fodder etc.,
reeds, or grain, 2. a vessel (?)” (CD 208a; CED 98) = “ein Maß für Futtermit
tel” (KHW 89), which is improbable not so much because of the gender change
(projected by Osing for Dem., although the masc. var. occurs already in the NK),
but much rather due to the apparently different basic senses: (1) Dem.-Cpt. *mj%
“a measure” vs. (2) NK m%.t (sort of vessel). Note that the mng. “2. ein Maß für
Kraut” attributed to Eg. m%.t.t (used for sm.w only in Pap. Leiden I 350, vs. 1:x +

nb: Following G. Mattha, J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 132), W. Westendorf (KHW 89), and
W. Vycichl (DELC 109–110) too explained Dem.-Cpt. *mj% “a measure” eventually
from Eg. m% “to "ll”.
" 2. W. A. Ward (1961, 40, #33) saw in its supposed metathetic form *%m > Cpt. (S) Home (f ) “cup” (CD 676a) = “Schale, Tasse” (KHW 371) a cognate of Ug. %m (sic) “bottle (for wine)” [Gordon 1955, 263, #637]. Hardly correct. Both comparanda are etymologically problematic.
nb1: J. Osing (NBÄ 186, 710, n. 822) convincingly derived the Cpt. word from Eg.
%nw.t “Becher, Napf ” (OK, Wb III 106) via *%ånw.'t > *%åm.'(t), although in the
light of his own syllable rules, C. Peust (1999, 163–4, §3.16.3) denies here the effect
of the assimilation or merger process of -nw- > -m-, which is supposed to have
worked only in direct contact of -nw-.
nb2: The Ug. form is enigmatic, not listed as such in any of the standard lexicons
except for that of Gordon, who distorted in fact Ug. %m-t “Lederschlauch” [WUS
105, #945] = %m-t “wineskin” [DUL 365], which hardly suits either Eg. m%.t or

nb: The etymology of the Harari word is uncertain. W. Leslau (l.c.) assumed this
to be connected with Geez mah2w “utensil of glass, bottle” and its ES cognates,

nb: V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 199; HSED #1712) equated the Somray word
with Eg. m03 (below). This isolated form, however, being of a rather unclear his

" 3. GT: its striking resemblance to Common Aram. m%" “to weave”

connected with the basic meaning ’to strike’ even if the semantic shifts implied are not yet properly

Traditionally (Wb II 120, 11–12; Erman 1928, 5; Grapow 1950, 74) rendered as a "gurative use (Erman: lit. “ellenlang”) of Eg. m% “cubit” (q.v.), which is supposed to have been regarded in Egypt as the size for a baby.
nb: The new-born (future royal) children are in Westcar 10:10 one cubit in length,
cf. 4rd n m% w« “Kind von einer Elle” (Wb l.c.).
" 2. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 184) equated it with ECh. *may“child” [OS], cf. Kwang (dials. of Alowa, Tchagine Golo) kê-may “enfant” [Coates 1991 MS, 1] | Tumak mài “child” [ JI 1994 II, 75]. Not clear whether the ECh. forms can be derived from AA *m-% (or sim.).
*m# (?) > Dem. m% “sehen” (BM 10507, 1:9, TLA, kind p.c. by H. Satzinger, 28 Dec. 2006) " Cpt. (SL) mouH, (A) mouG, (B) moH “(intr.) to look”, (B) “appearence” (CD 210b) = “sehen, blicken”, (B) “Anblick, Erscheinung” (KHW 111).
nb: In the light of (B) -o-, an original *-% is to be preferred to *-h (cf. Lacau 1965,
9–11; Peust 1999, 237, §5.6.2.2), which is con"rmed by the Dem. ex. But (A) -G is
quite unexpected with regard to (B) -H.
! No evident pre-Cpt. etymon is attested (CED, KHW, DELC). GT: eventually an irregular cognate of ECu. *mV«- “to see, look at” [GT]
!!! WCh. *m-y “to see” [GT] (discussed s.v. Eg. m “behold!”, q.v.)?
nb: Ch. -y-/-Ø- may in principle be derived from AA *-%-, but ECu. *-«- + Eg. -%-.
Note, however, that the common AA af"x *% (nominal class marker of anatomical
terms) > Eg. % appears in ECu. as *«.

m#3 “Hinterkopf ” (PT, Wb II 128, 1; GHWb 356) = “nuque” (Massart 1959, 233, §34) = “back of the head” (FD 114).
nb: J. Breasted (1930, 113) surmised in m%3 a scribal error for mk%3 (q.v.), although
it occurs a few times.
! Derives (via pre"x m-) from Eg. %3 “Hinterkopf ” (PT, Wb III 8, 5–11) = “occiput, back of ear” (FD 161). GT: the same pre"x mV- (for which cf. Mlt. 2005, 87) may occur in Ar. ma-%3l-(at)- “milieu du dos, vertèbre” < %3l- “8. paquet, hardes qu’on porte sur son dos, 9. dos du cheval, surtout cette partie que l’on couvre d’un drap, sou la selle” [BK I 518, 520].

n. 1378 (ad Grapow); Smith 1979, 161.
nb1: The etymology of Eg. %3 has been disputed. (1) Most probably akin to Ar.
%al3"-at- “milieu, surtout du derrière de la tête”, cf. "a%l3- & %al3w3n, pl. %ul3win
“milieu du derrière de la tête” [BK 484] = %u/al3w-at-u ’l-qaf3 “the middle of
the back of the neck” [Lane 634] = %al3"-at- “the middle part of the back of the
head” [Ember] = %al"-at- “Hinterkopf ” [Vrg.] < Sem. *%a/ul(l)- “spinal column with
thigh bones” [SED I #114]. For Eg.-Sem.: Ember 1917, 88, #138; 1930, #3.c.6,
#14.a.9; Vrg. 1945, 130, #1.d.16. (2) The equation with Sem. *"0r “dernier” (sic)
suggested by P. Lacau (1970, 37–39) is false (Eg. % + Sem. 0). (3) Eg. %3 can have
nothing to do with WCh. *%ama “head” either (as proposed in OS 1992, 186;
HSED #1208).
nb2: Eg. m%3 has nothing to do with Eg. m%.tj “northern” (as suggested by P. Lacau
1913, 219, §453).
m#3 “eine Krankheit” (NK Med./Mag., WMT 386, cf. Borghouts 1971, 111, n. 225) = “an illness” (Osing 1978, 189) = “en#ures (?)” (AL 78.1826) = “eine Krankheit: *Geschwulst” (GHWb 356) = “Hautausschlag” (HAM 839).
nb: Regarded by J. Osing (l.c.) as the etymon of Cpt. (S) mhHe (f ) “tumour, abscess”
(CD 211a) = “Abszeß” (KHW 110), which is highly dubious, since the fem. Cpt.
form suggests an etymon *mÉ/†%.'t (with "nal fem. -t rather than -3), which
W. Westendorf (KHW), in addition, explained from Eg. m% “full”.
! Etymology obscure. W. Westendorf (1957, 298; WMT l.c.) assumed in it an m- pre"x derivative of the Grundstamm *%3 based by him on the erroneous comparison of clearly unrelated words like %3.t-jb “Kummer, Leid”, w%3.w “Hautausschlag oder ähnliche krankhafte Erscheinung der Körperober#äche (wahrsch. Trachom)”, n%3 “Bez. einer unebenen (welligen, zerfurchten oder körnigen) Ober#äche”, n%3.t “Augenkrankheit, eig. Unebenheit (Follikelbildung?)” originating in distinct roots. A derivation from *w%3 is not excluded.
m#j “1. im Wasser sein, schwimmen, im Wasser ertrinken, jem. ertränken, ins Wasser werfen, zu Wasser gebracht werden (vom Schiff ), ge#ößt werden (von Holz), 2. voll Wasser sein: überschwemmt sein,
484 m"3 – m"j



reichlich #uten usw.” (OK, Wb II 121–2) = “être immergé, être dans l’eau” (Montet 1928, 8–9) = “1. ertrinken, im Wasser sterben, 2. zu Wasser bringen, ins Wasser werfen, 3. schwimmen, geschwemmt werden” (ÜKAPT VI 133) = “1. nager, 2. mettre à l’eau (?)” (Posener 1950, 296) = “1. to (be) drown(ed), 2. over#ow (of Nile), inundate (land), 3. swim, 4. to launch (a vessel, boat)” (FD 114; AECT III 201) > OCpt. meHia= “versinken” (Osing 1976, 54; KHW 522). ! Hence: (1) m%j.t “Flut”, occurs mostly in m%.t-wr.t > Gk. D!E#!( (PT, Wb II 122), (2) m%.w “als Bez. für die Krokodile” (LP, Wb II 122, 20) = “crocodile (lit. ’immersed’)” (Leitz 1999, 99), (3) m%j.t (coll.) “die Fische” (OK, Wb II 127, 10) = “Bez. der Fische im allgemeinen ohne Spezi"zierung der Art (ebenso alt wie rmw, nur als Kollekt.)”, lit. “die Wasserbewohner” (GW 1970, 19), etc.
nb1: For further possible derivatives of this root cf. Erman 1928, 5; Montet 1928,
8–9. However, Eg. m%.t “das Sump#and von Unterägypten” (q.v.) does not neces
sarily belong here, cf. Eg. m%.w “Unterägypten” (q.v.).
nb2: There are some false etymologies proposed for the coll. Eg. m%j.t (mistakenly
separated from the underlying root). Thus, L. Homburger’s (1930, 254) comparison
of it with Nub. kare “poisson” is absurd. The same applies to its equation with
Class. Ar. %$t- “"sh” apud A. Ju. Militarev (2006, 21, §29.3).
! Origin disputable. A couple of attractive solutions have been offered so far, by neither of these is entirely convincing. It is uncertain if these comparanda are ultimately related. " 1. W. Vycichl (1953, 373) equated it with Ar. my%: m3%a I “1. descendre dans le puits où il y a peu d’eau pour remplir son seau, 2. tirer, prendre, puiser l’eau, 7. se remplir la bouche de salive”, VIII “1. puiser, tirer de l’eau, 4. faire suer abondamment, p.ex. la partie convexe de la tête du chameau (se dit du soleil qui agit sur cette partie de la tête)” [BK II 1170] = “waten” and “Wasser schöpfen” [Vcl.].
nb: Semantically, Ar. “waten” would "t Eg. m%j “im Wasser sein, schwimmen”.
" 2. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 198; HSED #1756): Eg. m%j “to swim” ~ WCh.: SBauchi: Boghom myau “to swim”. GT: add perhaps also NBrb.: Mgild â-um “to bathe, swim” [Harries 1974, 227] !!! LECu.: Somali mã%-ayya “to cross (the ocean), ford, thread one’s way (through the people)” [Abr. 1964, 171]?
nb: In theory possible, though one single isolated Ch. word cannot be of serious
use in AA etymologies.
" 3. GT: the cognacy with WCh.: Dera m3y- “benetzen” [ Jng. 1966 MS, 10] = (?) màyé “1. to take a bath, 2. bathe (a person)” [Nwm. 1974, 129] = m3y- “to pour, wet” (sic) [Stl.] | Bubure —aa"a [—- <
*m-?] “wet” [Haruna 1992 MS, #c026] !! CCh.: Mbara mò & Vulum
m"j 485



mì “verser” [TSL 1986, 199] is equally uncertain, since these comparanda might be equated – at the present level of our knowledge of Ch. historical phonology – also with the re#exes of AA *m-" “water”
[GT] > Eg. mw (q.v.).
nb1: Surprisingly, V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED 375, #1726) explained the Eg.
root (combined with Dera) via an absurd shift of LEg. -%- < old *-0- (sic), whereby
the set up AA *maq- (sic) “to pour”.
nb2: Whether Ar. ma%w-at- “2. pluie” (listed under )m%w: ma%3 “effacer”) [BK II
1071] belongs here is also dubious.
! Other suggestions are certainly false: " 4. W. F. Albright (1918, 93), A. Ember (1930, §10.b.9, §14.a.6), F. von Calice (1936, #637): ~ Ar. b3%-at- “#ood, mass of water”. Phonologically incorrect (Eg. b- + Sem. *m-). " 5. Ch. Ehret (1995, 305, #583): ~ PCu. *m3%- “to get wet” < AA *-m3%- “to get wet”.
nb: The PCu. form was based by Ch. Ehret (1987, #416) on the false equation of
LECu.: Som. m3%o (sic, -%-) “to leak, seep” [Ehret] !! Agaw *maw- “to dissolve”
[Ehret]. Nevertheless, the Som. word has been recorded with -h-: m3h- “her
vorquellen, #ießen” > m3hi “frisches, #iessendes Wasser” [Rn. 1902, 289], which
corresponds to Sem. *mhw (cf. Eg. mhwj).
" 6. N. Skinner (1997, 77–78, §7) derived both Eg. mw “water” and m%j “to swim” from AA *m “water”, which is absurd. " 7. Th. Schneider (1997, 198, #36): ~ Brb. *m-3 “feucht, naß, durchnäßt sein” > *m-3-y “wachsen (von P#anzen)”. Phonologically false (Eg. -%- + Brb. *3).
m#j.t “die Löwengöttin von This und von Sebennytos” (OK, Wb II 127, 7–8).
nb: Vocalized form reconstructed as (OK) *ma%†j.at > (NK) *ma%† > (LP) *ma%É

shift of NK *-†- > LP *-É- on the basis of its re#ection in cuneiform (Amarna, EA

Lpr. 1995, 39. Note that EA 7, 76 m/lúpa-ma-0u-[u/ú] should be separated from
EA 162, 74 mpa-ma-0a-a (Edel 1948, 24 contra Albright, JEA 23, 1937, 200–1,
n. 4), whose rendering is debated (cf. Zorn 1991, 131–8). An indirect re#ection
of the presumed LP (7th cent. BC) vocalization *ma%É ~ *me%É of Eg. m%j.t has
been pointed out by E. Edel (1988, 34–35) in the cryptogram composed by a fal
con (Month) + lioness (m%j.t) rendered by J. Leclant (BdE 35, 1961, 247) and L.
Habachi (ASAE 51, 1951, 458f.) as the secret form of PN mn2.w-m-%3.t vocalized
at that time (7th cent. BC) presumably as *manti-ma-%É, cf. (NAss.) ma-an-ti-me
<am>-0e-e and Gk. D9"%92BQ7.
! Etymology highly debated: " 1. Usually derived from Eg. m% “full” (q.v.), whereby its literal sense has been rendered as “die Volle” or “das (wieder) Vollgemachte (Himmelsauge)”. This connection, in L. Kákosy’s (l.c. infra) opinion,
486 m"j.t

" 2. Following H. Junker (1917, 131), J. Osing (NBÄ 201, 731) and W. Schenkel (1983, 224) explained its original meaning from Eg. m% “to hold” (q.v.) as “die Packende (Löwin)” . " 3.

Strangely, J. Osing (1998, 295, n. b) prefers m%« treating the arm det. (probably
due to the in#uence of m% “arm, cubit”) as the 3rd root consonant -«.

138), W. Spiegelberg (KHW 71), J. ,erný (CED 100), E. Graefe & M. Wassef (1979,
117), who either demonstratively ignored or "rmly and probably rightly declined
the usual derivation of the Cpt. word from Eg. m«%«.t (q.v.). J. Osing "gured a
development *m'«%°«(w).'t > *m'«%°"(w).'t (sic) > (?) *m'"%°"w.'t (NBÄ 209, 746,
n. 906), but his arguments are weak or even contradictory: (1) the fact that the
Dem. forms have -w instead of -« can only prove the identity of the Dem. and
Cpt. word; (2) the fact that the diverse Cpt. re#exes of Eg. )«%« indicate no trace
of -« does not make it necessary the derivation from m«%«.t; (3) the Cpt. double
vowel is not necessarily an evidence merely for -« but also for -j- (act. *-"-), cf. e.g.
(S) bwwn “bad” < bjn (Peust 1999, 206 with lit.) or (S) msooH (pl.) “crocodiles”
< mz%.jw (BD 130 of Budge) via met. with the epenthesis of -j- in the root (Lacau
1903, 157; Spg. 1927, 656; Edel 1954, 36; Vcl. 1990, 186, §3). In addition, no
-w- is attested in Eg. m«%«.t as forced by Osing (Fecht 1960, 180, §373, fn. 504).
Moreover, Dem. «%«j3.t ~ m«%«j.t are attested (Graefe & Wassef 1979, 117, fn.

nb3: The rdg. of m%- in the DG ex. of m%w is dubious, perhaps rather mr- (Graefe
& Wassef l.c.).
! Origin obscure. E. Graefe & M. Wassef (1979, 117) assumed an old etymon *m%w. GT: no certain external (AA) cognates, only ECh.: Toram mohe “grave (tomb)” [Alio-Jng. 1988, 22; Alio 2004, 260, #328], whose Ch. background has to be investigated.
nb: Any connection to HECu.: Burji múh-1 “two stones placed on grave of deceased

nb1: The old rdg. of the OK root as m%j (e.g., Loret l.c.; Wb l.c.; Pusch 1974, 21;
Germer l.c.; Manniche l.c.) is incorrect and it is to be read m%« (cf. Lacau 1903,

Bidoli 1976, 63; DELC 129; DCT 177). Edel (l.c.) assumed a quadrilit. m%«w (OK)
> m%«j (MK). Later, m%«w may have indeed shifted into *m%«j, where -j- was in
fact -"- (Peust 1999, 103). The OK forms m«% (Badawy 1952–54, 140) and %m«
(Spg., Lacau) may represent in fact a “simple disposition calligraphique” (Lacau) rather
than a real metathesis.

! Origin obscure. " 1. W. Spiegelberg (1902, 180) af"liated it with Eg. m%.w “Delta” (rendered lit. as “Flachsland”) on the analogy of 3.t “papyrus” vs. “Delta”. But the roots (m%« vs. m%) hardly accord.
" 2. W. Vycichl (1991, 119) assumed in it the trace of an African substrate, but was unable to quote any lexical evidence for it. GT: no AA parallels that could be equated with Eg. m%«.

would be only plausible if we assume Eg. -%« < *-«« corresponding (in principle) to
Sem. *-¿¿ (*-$T$T) acc. to the Rössler theory (cf. EDE I 336). L. Reinisch (l.c.) af"liated

nb: The Eg. Ar. word may be alternatively either derived from Class. Ar. 0awal
“Besitz an Vieh” > ma-0w3l- “food storage-room, crop storing-room” [Dostal apud

Usually rendered as a compound, where the "rst component was identi"ed with Cpt. (S) maH “nest”, but the etymology of the second one is not evident. J. ,erný (1973) derived (S) *oual from LEg. w3nr “Hof (?)” (cf. Bojowald 2003, 17 & fn. 16).

nb: The hapax w3r hardly suits as the second element of m%wn. J.F. Borghouts
(1981, 272) maintains that it “is not a new word, but wr ‘swallow’ in group-writing”
like bwn3 for bnw “heron” in Ostr. DeM 1436, x+4. W. Guglielmi (l.c.), however,
rightly rejected its equation with Eg. wr “swallow”. But as S. Bojowald (2003, 16)
points out, the rendering of w3r is against the context. Moreover, he (o.c., p. 18)
explained it as a late borrowing from Akk. wâru “(heran)gehen” [AHW 1471] =
“gehen, laufen” [Bojowald].

Gwandara kwaši [Mts. 1972, 75] is dubious.
nb2: Sh. Yeivin (1936, 80, #41) compared Eg. %s with Hbr. & Aram. s2%5t3 “dirt,
unclean things”, Ar. s%y “to scrape off, clear away” via met., which seems less
probable.
m#&r.t (GW) “Fischteich” (late NK, Wb II 129, 11) = “pond” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 343; DLE I 236) = “"sh dike, "sh net” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 81) = “"sh pond or enclosure(s) made with small dykes” (Hoch 1994, 150).
nb: Written syllabically as ma-%Ü-sá-r-tá ~ ma%-sa-r-ta (Helck) = ma-%à-)i-r-tá ~
ma-%à-)a-r-tá ~ ma%-)a-r-tá (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey). Vocalized as *ma%)arta (?)
(sg.) vs. *ma%)ar3ta (pl.) (Hoch).
! Apparently a nomen loci/instr. borrowed from Sem., although the underlying root is disputed: " 1. W. Helck (1971, 514, #106) explained it from the basic sense “wasserreich” < “grün” in the light of the assumed connection with Sem. *0$Tr > Hbr. %3)5r “grass” [KB 344] | Ar. 0a*ira “to be green” [KB]. Declined by J. Hoch (1994, 150) as “virtually impossible”, the suggested primary sense being “inappropriate”. " 2. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 35, §2.1.3.2.2 & p. 62, §2.4.2), followed by J. Hoch (1994, 150), compared it with Sem. *%.r > Ug. %Kr “mansion, cuartel, measure of length” [DUL 382], Hbr. %3)1r “yard without walls, court(yard), enclosure (around building)” [KB 345] | Ar. %aKara “to make inaccessible, con"ne cattle in fence”,
m"!r.t 495



%aK5r-at- “enclosure, corral, pen” [KB, Hoch]. Cf. also Ar. %a)ara “to encircle, enclose”, %a)r- “enclosure” [Hoch].
nb: No m- pre"x re#exes attested in Ug. and Hbr., but cf. Ar. ma-%K$r-at- “chose
sacrée, dont l’accès est défendu” < ma-%K$r- “1. tenu, enfermé dans une cloison,
2. ("g.) inaccessible, inabordable, autour duquel on élève une muraille” [BK I 454],
which, however, hardly suits LEg. m%3r.t.
" 3. Alternatively, J. Hoch (1994, 150, §193) af"liated it with Sem. *%$Tr > Hbr. %-)1r5m (pl.) “1. permanent settlements” [KB 345] | Ar. %a*ara “to be present, settle”, %a*ar- “place of residence, Bedouin camp” [KB] with hesitation (“not very likely on semantic grounds”).
m% “jemanden ehren” (MK, Wb II 129, 12; GHWb 357) = “to respect (so.)” (FD 115) > Dem. mj0 “Ehre”, m0j “ehren” (DG 153, 176). ! Hence: m0 “the honoured one (?)” (CT VII 482, AECT III 174, spell 1137, n. 3).
nb1: For its doubtful and unlikely occurence in the Eg. Aram. epithet %stm% (on
a stela from Saqqara, 482 BC) rendered via Eg. %zj.tj “Günstling” + Dem. m0j
“ehren” (Grelot) see Vittmann 1993, 240.
nb2: Whether this root has anything to do with Eg. m0.t in Pap. Leiden I 348, rt.
10:4 (alternatively m-0.t, rendered by J. F. Borgouts 1971, 111, n. 227 as “means”)
and/or in Pap. Chester Beatty VII, rt.3:3 (2zj r m0.t “rise to the . . .”) is not clear.
! GT: it could be eventually cognate with Geez "amm20a “salutavit”,
"amme03 “osculum, salutatio, munus, donum, munera (venerationis
causa oblata)” [Vcl.] = "amm20a ~ "amm2%a “to kiss, embrace,
greet, salute, worship, revere, pay respect to, offer a gift out of respect”, "amm203 “kiss, salute/-ation, greetings, gift offered out of
respect, present”, "2mm30e “greeting, salutation” [Lsl. 1987, 23:
isolated in Sem.] = "am0a “baiser, donner des signes de plaisir et de
vénération à qqn.” [DRS 22: isolated in Sem.] !!! WBrb.: Zng. emgek (1st sg. aor.) “louer, célebrer” [Bst. 1909, 244] !!! NAgaw: Hamir mikek “verherrlichen, preisen, Ehrenbezeugungen erweisen (einem Mächtigen, Grossen)”, mikk-eš “mächtig sein” < *”geehrt werden” [Rn. 1884, 392] < AA *m-q (?) “to respect” [GT].
nb1: The etymology of the Geez root has been strongly debated. E.g., F. Praetorius
(1890, 30) explained Geez "amm20a < *"am"a0a as a denom. verb stemming from
m3"20a “brotherhood, friendship” literally denoting “to treat so. as a brother”.
C. Conti Rossini (1905, 205) and C. Brockelmann (1950, 15), in turn, assumed a
borrowing from the NAgaw verb “to kiss”, cf. Qemant y2ma3 [Rn., Apl.], Qwara
ima3 [Rn.] = y2ma3- [Apl.], Hamir (i)emqw [Rn.] = 2mqw- [Apl.], Hamta am$0
[CR, Apl.], Damot amaq [Rn.]. Both suggestions were (rightly) rejected by W. Leslau
(l.c.). D. Appleyard (2006, 89) suggested just the opposite direction of borrowing
(NAgaw < ES/Geez). Besides, L. Reinisch (1895, 24) combined the Agaw root for
“to kiss” with Ar. wmq “lieben” as well as Eg. jm30j “verehren, lieben” (sic) (Rn.)
= “(tr.) jem. ehren” (XXII., Wb II 81, 15) < (intr.) “würdig, geehrt sein” (MK, Wb
I 13–15) < jm30 “1. Würde, Würdigkeit; 2. Ehrung” (OK, Wb II 81, 16–17). W.
Vycichl (1958, 404) too combined Geez )"m0 with Eg. jm30. This comparison is
496 m#



hardly correct due to the semantic and phonological (Eg. -3- + Geez -Ø-) dif"cul
ties. In addition, L. Reinisch (1895, 97) equated the Geez root with NAgaw: Qwara
*magwa > magå-š (caus.) “singen” [Rn.] = mago-šow “to sing” [Flad].
nb2: There may be further Sem. cognates. Cf. PBHbr. m%y hi"l “3. to recognize as
an authority, (in gen.) authorize, appoint” [ Jastrow 1950, 759], which M. Jastrow
treated as a denom. verb from m$m%e(h) “tried, skilled, expert, practical”. Or cf.
Ar. my0: m30a “avoir une démarche "ère, se donner des airs en marchant” [BK
II 1171]?
nb3: The Eg.-ES-WBrb.-NAgaw isogloss may be eventually connected with SCu.:
Ma’a -máka “to wonder, be astonished” [Ehret] !!! WCh.: Hausa mààmáákì “being
surprised”, àbím mààmáákì “wonder, marvel” [Abr. 1962, 652] < AA *m-q (unless
*m-k) “to wonder” [GT]. For the semantic shift cf. Hung. csodál “to admire,
respect” ~ csodálkozik “to wonder” < csoda “miracle”. Note that Ch. Ehret (1980,
155, #21) explained the Ma’a word from his SCu. *mâ=- “to be happy”, which is
semantically unlikely.
nb4: Eg. m0 and its AA cognates above might be (alternatively) af"liated with AA
*m-Q (*-[#]?) “elder relative” [GT]: Sem. *m0"x > Akk. (OAss.) ma03"um “uncle
(?)” [AHW 582] = ma03"um or ma003"um “(mng. uncertain, seems to indicate a
relationship) possibly elder brother or sister (in a family or in a commercial partner
ship)” [CAD m1, 85] !!! CCh.: Higi-Kamale mu0a “old men” [Mkr. 1987, 253]
!! ECh. *m-K “grandparent” [GT]: Kwang-Mobu mùg-dúm “grand-père” [Ebert
1977 MS, 8] | Bdy. migi “grand-père” [AJ 1989, 99], Mkl. mùgìyé (m) “grand
père”, mògá (f ) “grand-mère” [ Jng. 1990, 140, 142], Mokilko mògá “grand-mère”
& mùgìyé “grand-père” [ Jng. 1990, 140, 142], WDng. mígò (mìgò?) “parent par
alliance: beau-père, gendre (terme réciproque)” [Fédry 1971, 131], EDng. mìgò
“beau-père, gendre” [Dbr.-Mnt. 1973, 204] | Birgit mòkòo-tù “mon grand-père”
[ Jng. 1973 MS], Toram mogot “grandfather” [AJ 1988 MS, 20], Kofa mógótá
“grandfather” [ Jng. 1977, 15, #34]. The etymology of the OAss. term is disputed:
the authors of CAD surmised a connection to Sum. ma0. W. von Soden (AHW 582,
586) assumed a cognacy with Akk. ma00û “Ekstatiker, Prophet” < ma0û “rasen”
(unconvincing). O.V. Stolbova (1994 MS, 1; HSED #1801), in turn, connected the
Akk. word to the Ch. term for “chief ”, which is eventually possible (discussed below
within this entry), but there can be no connection to Eg. mh.wt “relatives etc.” (q.v.)
as suggested in HSED #1801, since Eg. h + AA *Q. This Akk.-Ch. isogloss may
be related also with CCh.: Higi mu0a, Fali-Muchella mu0a-ruku “old” !! ECh.: (?)
Sokoro mù"iyá [-"- < *-0-?] “old” (Ch.: Mkr. 1987, 279).
nb5: The same applies to its eventual kinship with AA *m-[#] “chief ” [GT]. Cf.
NOm.: Haruro m3g3 “capo della communità del villaggio” [CR 1937, 653] !!! Ch.
*mu=a[V"] “chief ” [Stl. 1996, 130] = *m-k-m “chief ” [ JI 1994 I 34C] = *m-[0]-y
[GT] > WCh.: Jimbin mùgà"á “chief ” [Skn.] !! CCh. *muq1a “king” [Stl.]: Higi
mÜ3, “chief ” [Krf.], Higi-Nkafa mb2g! “chief ” [Meek], Higi-Kamale —g2 “chief ”
[Meek] Fali-Kiria ,—3ù “king” [Stl.: *m3u < *mu3V], Kapsiki m232 “chief ” [Stl.]
| Dghwede màgàmá “chief ” [Frick] = mà0ámá [IL] = mù3àma “king” [Stl.] |
Lamang mbagam [Meek] = ámghàm ~ Ömghàm [Lks.], Hide (Hitkala) m3àm
“chef, roi” [Eguchi 1971, 219] | PKotoko *m3ai “chief ” [GT] = *mVHV “-!5(.,

= my[ZDe [Mch.] = mían3é [Lks./JI] = mán/e ~ m/ai [Mkr.] = m/ai “chief ” [Stl.]
(Ch.: Mkr. 1987, 124; JI 1994 II, 72–73; Stl. 1996, 130). Note that the Chadic
terms listed above should be separated from the misleadingly similar Wanderwort
ultimately borrowed from Kanuri mâi “king”, cf. WCh.: Hausa mài “he/she who
owns, chief of . . .” [Abr. 1962, 637] | Gerka m"i “König, Häuptling” [ Jng. 1965,
174] | Tangale maî “king, chief, head, leader, owner” [ Jng. 1991, 118], Kir" me

who descends from the line of the Mais of Birni Ngazargamo” [Schuh 1981, 109] !!
m# 497



CCh.: Ngala mai “king, chief ” [Meek/Slk.], Buduma mei ~ mai “König, Häuptling”
[Nct./Lks. 1939, 118], Makeri & Affade mê (act. mee) “king, chief ” [Barth/Slk.] =
mê “chef ” [Lbf./Slk.], Sao me “chef ” [Gaudefroy-Demombynes/Slk.], Gulfei me
“chef ” [Gaudefroy-Demombynes/Slk.] = me “Häuptling” [Lks. 1937] = mê “chef ”
[Lbf./Slk.], Kuseri me ~ men “chef ” [Gaudefroy-Demombynes/Slk.] = mê “chef ”
[Lbf./Slk.] (Ktk.: Slk. 1967, 273, §363; Prh. 1972, #1.6). The etymology of WCh.:
Bokkos màkàày, pl. kayà “king” [ Jng. 1968, 10, #108] = “König, Häuptling” [ Jng.
1970, 144] is obscure, but in any case it may be a ma- pre"x form. N. Skinner
(1977, 28) falsely derived Jimbin mùgà"á from NBch. *malv-.
nb6: The semantic connection of “respect” vs. “chief ” vs. “old” seems to have
existed in AA, cp., e.g., NAgaw: Bilin bähär, bahar “vieux, respectable, grand,
notable” !! LECu.: Somali boqor, bo3or “chief, king” (Cu.: Dlg. 1967, 7, #3) or
PBrb. *m-=-r > *m-3-r “être vieux, notable, grand” [GT] (Brb.: Dlg. 1967, 7, #3;
Mlt. 1991, 252, #5.1).
! Other suggestions cannot be accepted: " 1. C. H. Gordon (1955, 287, #1085), followed by K. Aartun (1979, 1), af"liated it with Sem.: Ug. m0 “indeclinable interjection” (attested a few times in the Aqht-poem in: hw/hy m0 interpreted as “may he/she prosper!”) [Gordon] = “ein Ausdruck des Ausrufs” [Aartun] and even Ar. m00: "ama00a “to be fat”. False. These comparanda
can hardly belong to the same root.
nb1: J. Aistleitner (WUS #1543) glossed the Ug. form s.v. m0 “beruhigt, betrost”
combined with Ar. mw0 “ruhig, besänftigt sein, sich beruhigen”.
nb2: Ar. "ama00a is in fact just a denom. verb < mu00- “1. moelle, 2. cervelle, 3.
graisse, 4. matière adipeuse de l’oeil” [BK II 1071] deriving ultimately from com
mon Sem. *mu00- “brain” [SED I 169–170, §187], which has hardly anything to
do either with the Ug. word in question or with Eg. m0.
" 2. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 196, #1772) equated Eg. m0 with LECu.: Afar ma«an (misquoted as *magan) “sg. that is taboo” [PH 1985,
160].
m% (or better m% j?) “Verbum von einer Krankheit: sich ausbreiten o.ä.” (Med., Wb II 129, 13: hapax) = “s’étendre” (Lefébvre 1956, 24) = “bändigen, einstellen” (WMT I 388) = “juguler” (AL 78.1832) = “im Keime ersticken” (GHWb 357) = “einstellen (schädliche Tätigkeit)” (HAM 578) = “eindämmen” (Hafemann after WMT, p.c. on 19 May 2000).
nb: Obscure word attested with three exx. It has apparently a fem. inf. (1) The read
ing of the supposed ex. in CT IV 328a is highly debated. R. O. Faulkner (AECT
I 271, spell 336, n. 11) left it untranslated surmising a connection to 0w.t.t (#ame
det.) “als Name eines der Tore des Jenseits” (BD, Wb III 247, 6), while R. van der
Molen (DCT 178) read the whole expression as one word (m0«.wt “#ame?”). But D.
Meeks (AL l.c.) maintained the rdg. as a compound: m0.w s3.t “celui qui jugule la
#amme”. (2) The context of Pap. Ebers 36:14 deals with a disease of the stomach
and liver of a patient whose condition is apparently on the way to bettering, when
the physician has to state: 03j.t pw %r m0.t wnm-s “c’est que la maladie s’étend et
qu’elle dévore” (Lefébvre 1956, 24, rejected in WMT) = “it shows that the disease
m0.t, it is consumed (i.e. decreases?)” (Ebbell 1937, 47) = this is a disease during
498 m#



m0.t (inf.) of its consuming” (GT). The translation “to extend” has been rejected
by W. Westendorf (in WMT I 388), who corrected its reading to m0r rendering it
as a Nebenform of m03 “fesseln”, which led him to translating the passage as “die
Krankheit bändigt (oder stellt ein) ihr Fressen” (WMT) = “es ist (der Fall, daß)
die Krankheitserscheinung dabei ist, ihre schädliche Tätigkeit (wörtlich: Fressen)
einzustellen” (HAM l.c.), which can hardly be projected to the other two occurences.
This suggestion has been rightly rejected by D. Meeks (AL l.c.: “cette correction n’emporte
pas l’adhésion”), who found the third occurence of Eg. m0 (3) in Edfu VII 112:15–16,
where the mng. “‘juguler’ conviendrait tout à fait”.
! Any etymology would be premature. " 1. GT: most attractive seems a derivation from AA *m-q (hardly *m-k because of Sem. *-0-) “to reject” [GT].
nb1: Attested in Ar. m0y: II ma003 “emmener qqn. pour qu’il soit loin de qqch.”,
V “2. se contenir et s’abstenir de qqch.” [BK II 1075] = “abstinuit” [Levy] !!!
HECu.: Sid. makk-i’r- “to refuse” [Gsp./Hds. 1989, 122, 384], Hdy. makk-at- “to

nb2: Whether Can. *m%/0y “eliminate by force (?)” [GT] > OHbr. m%y qal “to

PBHbr. & JAram. m%y “2. verbieten, wehren” [Levy 1924 III, 72–73] = i.a. “2.
to wear out, destroy”, piel i.a. “2. to forewarn, interfere, try to prevent” [ Jastrow
1950, 759] represents the same Sem. bicons. root is highly doubtful (a secondary
contamination with Can. *m%y “to wipe off ” is plausible).
" 2. GT: a connection to SBrb.: Tudalt & Tadghaq m-k--t “to be extinguished” [Sudlow 2001, 180] is hardly possible.
nb: Cf. SBrb.: EWlm. & Ayr m-=--t “être reduit à l’état de braises ardentes, 2.
se consumer, s’éteindre par manque de bois (feu)” derived from Ewlm. a-=u “être

braises ardentes sans #amme, 2. (par ext.) être achevé, tué, recevoir le coup de grâce,
s’achever” < u-ku “être allumé (avec ou sans #amme)” [Fcd. 1951–2, 720–1].
" 3. GT: presumably unrelated also to WCh.: PAngas *muk “to squeeze, throttle” [GT 2004, 254].
nb: Attested in Angas muk “to press, squeeze” [Flk. 1915, 247] = mùk “würgen”
(- Hs. >áá=è “1. to strangle, 2. "ll chock-full, be brimful”, Abr. 1962, 643, 799), mùk
twà—-twà— “to throttle” (twà—-twà— “Adam’s apple”) [ Jng. 1962 MS, 26].
" 4. GT: does it represent a tr. re#ex of AA *m-= “(to be) waste, empty” [GT]?
nb: Cf. Sem.: Yemeni Ar. ma00 “freilassen, befreien” [Behnstedt 1993, 193] !!!

“ausgehen, -fallen (Haare, Zähne), glatt, kahl werden” [Rn. 1888, 317] = makok-at
“cogliere” [Cecci apud Rn.].
" 5. GT: since the mng. “sich ausbreiten” (Wb) in Pap. Ebers 36:14 has been "rmly disproved, a comparison with Ar. )m00 > mu-mi00“long, qui se prolonge (affaire)” [BK II 1072] is excluded.

“schlagen, kämpfen” (DG 176) < Eg. m0(3)j “durchstossen (vom Speer)” (GR, Wb,

nb1: M. K. Feichtner (l.c.) erroneously identi"ed the "rst cons. of the denom. verb
m03 with the AA pre"x *m- expressing Gegenseitigkeit.
nb2: Following P. Kaplony (ZÄS 88, 1962, 11, n. 2), H. Goedicke (1966, 20 & fn.
3–4) doubted the derivation of Eg. m03.t < 03j (arguing that the latter denoted
“das Messen mit dem Scheffel, also einen völlig anderen Vorgang”) and suggested instead a
rather unlikely connection to Eg. 03.t (OK) > 03w.t (MK) “Platte mit Untersatz
(einbeiniger Tisch) zum Darbringen von Speisen” (PT, Wb III 226) = “(Tisch)Platte”
(Gdk.) as well as m03.wt “Landesteg” (MK, Gdk., below, plausible) and even m03
“verbinden” (Lit. MK, q.v.), which has little in common with measuring and cer
tainly represents a distinct root.
nb3: The etymology of Eg. 03j is not fully certain: (1) C.T. Hodge (1990, 371)
identi"ed it with Ar. 0ll: V ta0allala “to be or come between”, cf. 0il3l- “interval,
middle”, 0alal- “interval, gap, split” [Hodge]. Semantically weak. (2) GT: it might
be perhaps an irreg. (Eg. 0 + Sem. *k) cognate to Sem. *kyl > Ar. kyl: k3la “to
measure” !! MSA: Jbl. )kyl: mi'ol “measure” (Sem.: Lsl. 1987, 339). For the reg.
correspondence of Eg. IIIae -j roots with Sem. hollow roots see Vcl. 1953, 373–7.

! Other suggestions are either unlikely or cannot be accepted: " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 7) derived Eg. m03 “cordes” from Eg. 03j “to measure” (q.v.). " 2. H. Goedicke (1955, 33) and E. E. Knudsen (1962, 35, §7), in turn, combined Eg. m03 with Eg. m3.t “Art Klammer oder Fessel” (PT, Wb II 184–5, below) on the basis of the supposed interchange of Eg. 0 ~ 3.
nb: The presence vs. absence of -3 is disturbing. Moreover, there are but very
few truly convincing examples for the alleged alternance of Eg. 0 ~ 3 among the
examples gathered by Goedicke (1955), Vycichl (1957, 71–73), Knudsen (1962,
33–36).
" 3. W. W. Müller (1961, 202, #9) af"liated it with Sem.: Geez 0am(m)aya ~ %ammaya “to chain, tie, bind, shackle” [Lsl. 1987, 262–3] = 0amäyä “fesseln, mit Ketten binden (vinculis constringere, ligare, vincire)” [Müller] via met. But Eg. -3 vs. Geez -y are irregular.
nb: For Geez 0my, a different etymology has been suggested by W. F. Albright and
A. Ember, cf. Akk. 0amû “lähmen” [AHW 319] = “to immobilize, paralyze, stun”
[CAD 0 72] = “to hold, seize” (!) [Alb.], to which W. Leslau (l.c.) added also Ar.
%my: %am3 “défendre, protéger, empêcher, 2. interdire” [BK II 497] via the semantic
shift “to restrain” > “to tie, bind”. The suggested connection of Akk.-Geez parallel
to Eg. 0m« “fassen, packen” (PT, Wb III 281–2) is rather unlikely. The latter root
may be akin rather to SCu.: PRift *kom- “to hold, have” [GT] | Dahalo kam- “to

" 4. Later, H. Goedicke (1966, 20, fn. 4) seems to have changed his view and af"liated this root with Eg. m03.wt “Landesteg” (MK, Urk. VII 48:6) and m03.t “Wage” (OK, Wb, q.v.) derived from Eg. 03.t (OK) > 03w.t (MK) “Platte mit Untersatz (einbeiniger Tisch) zum Darbringen von Speisen” (PT, Wb III 226) = “(Tisch)Platte” (Gdk.). Semantically rather doubtful whether all these forms derive from the same root. " 5. R. Caminos (1977, 28), followed by L. Lesko (DLE I 258) and R. Hannig (GHWb 357), saw in it a var. of Eg. m33 “eingesperrt sein” (late NK, Wb, q.v.) = “einsperren” (Lange) = “to tie up, fetter” (Caminos) = “fesseln” (GHWb) with the interchange of Eg. 0 ~ 3.
m#3 503



nb: Plausible, provided Eg. m33 < AA *m-g-r/l (and not < AA *m-ç/æ/*-r/l, which
is not to be ruled out either), but this does not ultimately contradict the etymology
suggested above. Moreover, it adds nothing to the very etymology of Eg. m03.
" 6. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 199; HSED #1712) combined Eg. m03 with ECh.: Somray (Sibine) m3 “nouer” [Brt.-Jng. 1990, 114] = “to tie” [OS].
nb: Due to the lack of further Ch. lexical evidence, it is dif"cult to judge the etymol
ogy of the Somray word (cf. also Eg. m% “to spin or sim.”, above).
" 7. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 197, #1775) af"liated it with LECu. *m3g(sic) “to collect together”.
nb: His proto-form was based on Afar m3goy-ise “to collect together” [PH 1985,
157] and Som. m3g1r “enclosure” [Ehr.] that are even mutually unrelated.

nb1: The second ex. (suggested in Wb Belegstellen), namely m(-)03.w in CT I 269e,
has been rendered by H. Goedicke 1966 (after Belegstellen Wb ad II 130, 2) as
m03 “verbinden” (q.v.), while R. O. Faulkner (AEPT I 58) and R. van der Molen
(DCT 371) rendered it as m 03.w “in thousands”.
nb2: D. Meeks (p.c., 15 March 2000) doubts that it denotes the name of an animal
surmising in it rather a word for “skin”. But the context suggests the former solu
tion, cf. msktwj m msq n m03.w “armring of skin of m03.w”.
! Meaning dubious. Etymology uncertain. Since it is listed among the tributes of Syria and Palestina, we may not exclude a foreign origin. " 1. D. Meeks (p.c., 15 March 2000) supposes that it may be a pre"x m- extension of Eg. 03.w “Haut und sonstiger Abfall von Kleinvieh” (OK, Wb III 225, 8).

nb: The root is “in seinem Konsonantenbestand nicht eindeutig” (Fecht 1955, 291, §3). The
Ptol. Edfu vars. m0j ~ m0 ~ mš (PL 456) as well as the Cpt. re#exes suggest a IIIae
-j root in spite of the common view that its inf. (correctly vocalized) contained a
3rd alef, cf. *m50'3 (Vrg. 1973 Ib, 147) = *mñ0'3, st. pron. *m°/)03= > (B) mav=
(NBÄ 401) = *m50i3 (Zeidler 1999, 285, fn. 9), which is greatly motivated by the
(popular?) etymology (discussed under #1 below) based on the rather dubious
ultimate derivation of the sense “schlagen” from “gleich machen” (sic). Instead of
this controversial theory, which fails to answer also why the typical pattern of the
IIIae -3 verbal roots did not result in Cpt. (S) *!vai in this case, more appropriate
seems to assume an Eg. )m0j (*mñ0'j) regularly yielding (S) mive.

" 2. P. Wilson (PL 456), in turn, assumed an etymological connection to Eg. m03 “to bind” arguing that “by skewering sg. on a skewer separate pieces can be held together” (!), allotting that it “may be also (!) connected with” Eg. mšw “blade, weapon” and mš« “army”. The latter idea
is absurd.
nb: In the light of its GR context as well as the sense of its Cpt. re#exes, LEg. m03

nb1: This etymology also suggests an original Eg. )m0j. In order to a priori leave the
inner Eg. derivation from m03 (above) untouched, G. Fecht (1955, 291–2, esp. fn.
5) tried to render the Eg.-Can. match as a late borrowing. In his view, “an einfache
Entlehnung des äg. Wortes aus dem Semitischen ist gewiss nicht zu denken”, since the late
verbal loans from Sem. were in Eg. were vocalized acc. to the *C1ãC2'C3 pattern
(besides, for a possible late Eg. loan from Can. *m%" cf. Helck 1971, 514, #107).
Instead, as he argued, “vielleicht hat . . . das semitische Wort ein älteres ägyptisches m03 ‘sich
messen’ = ‘kämpfen’ in seiner Bedeutung dahingehend beein"ußt, daß dieses nun auch den Begriff
‘schlagen’ (und ‘durchstossen’) in sich aufnahm (Bedeutungsentlehnung)”. Although Fecht (l.c.)
regarded “diese freilich . . . hypothetische Lösung” as “wohl die nach dem Stand unserer Kenntnis
wahrscheinlichste”, this far-fetched hypothesis also fails to resolve the controversy of Eg.
)C1C2j (*C1ñC2'j) > (S) C1iC2e + Eg. )C1C23 yielding typically (S) *C1C2ai. Even
more unlikely is the suggestion by W. Vycichl (DELC 128) to assume an opposite
route of borrowing (Hbr. m%" from Eg. m03!).
nb2: W. von Soden (Or. 35, 16) and M. Dietrich (1967, 299) considered the Akk.

a hypothetic *ma0û as pointed out by B. Landsberger (quoted in CAD l.c.).

HO 61/3, rt. 2 & 13 (rendered both by D. Meeks 1997, 42 and E. RowiIska l.c.
as a sort of sieve); (3) HO 85/1 (Ostr. BM 5639a), vs. 6; (4) HO 63/1, vs. 2, out
of which D. Meeks (1997, 41–42) accepted only the "rst two exx. (“doît être retenue”),
while he eliminated the third ex. (being act. part of the name of the p3-n-m0jr
festival as pointed out in ,erný 1943, 174) and the fourth one (“plus que douteuse”,
a metal object, perhaps to be corrected).
nb3: For its occurence in the festival name p3-n-m0jr (late NK, cf. Wb II 131,
13–14), which resulted in the name of the 6th Cpt. month: (SLB) mvir, (SB) emvir,
(S) mevir, mpvir, (F) mivhr (hence Eg. Ar. "amš5r) ~ Gk. D!I!1( (from the pre
Bohairic Delta dialect, where the palatalization shift -0- > -š- did not take place),
see ,erný 1943, 174; 1958, l.c.; KHW 109; DELC 129. Note that (SB) mecir,
(F) mecil were re-borrowed from Gk. Note that ,erný (1958 l.c.) associated the
month name alternatively with Hbr. m2%5r “price”.
nb4: For a fem. m0r.t “panière” (Ostr. DeM 1657, l. 2) see Mathieu 1993, 344 & fn. 44.

CRAIBL 1945, 565) = “Gefäß, Behälter” (KHW 109) = “encensoir” (DELC 129) = “basket” (sic) (Zeidler 1993, 581).
nb: A direct derivation of the Cpt. term (denoting a metal vessel) from Eg. m0jr
“a basket” ("rst proposed by M. Burchardt and then defended in CED 97) was
rightly doubted by J. ,erný (1958, 213), who, however, presumed both words to
have originated separately from the same month name. Later, he (CED 97) did not
exclude this to have happened vice versa, namely that the eponymous festival was
named after the object. This Eg.-Cpt. etymology was declined by D. Meeks (1997,
41–42, §195). Similarly, J. Zeidler (1993, 581) assumed in Cpt. (S) m(e)vir vs.
!vir purely homophones.
! Etymology debated: " 1. J. ,erný (1958, 206–7, §3 & p. 213) rendered the “prototype” of Eg. m0jr in the name of the LEg. festival p-n-m0jr (and month D!I!1() as a term originally signifying a building, assuming that the festival and month gave the name to the receptacle, which, in his view, was presumably “a prominent object used athe festival” ( just as the vessel named after the LEg. festival/month k3-%r-k3 served for measuring incense).

" 2. W. Helck (1962, 561), D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 12, §1.2.1.1), and J. Hoch (1994, 151, #195) presumed Eg. m0jr to have been borrowed from Sem. *m0r “to receive” (although this root is not attested in OTHbr. with this mng., cf. Akk. m0r “to receive”, hence nam03ru “bowl, jug”, ESA m0r “to receive”), whereby they rendered Eg. *m30iru as a G stem part., literally “receptical” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey) = “that which receives” " “receptacle” (Hoch). Rejected by D. Meeks (1997, 41–42, §195) as not “valable”. " 3. E. RowiIska (1992, 43–44), rejecting the idea of Helck, explained Eg. m0jr as a borrowing from Akk. ma00alu “ein Korb oder Kasten (?)” [AHW 582] = “a basket” [CAD m1, 89] = “a basket used as a sieve” (- Sum. gi.gur.sè.sè.ga “a basket of throwing/shaking” & gi.gur. še.nu.tuk “a basket that does not hold #our”) [RowiIska after Salonen 1965–66 I, 68, 222], cf. also Akk. ma00altu “Sieb” [AHW 582] = ma00altu “a type of sieve” [CAD m2, 89], which are nomina instr. of the Akk. verbal root )n0l “(durch)sieben” (following the pattern ma-pras-, i.e., *ma-n0al- > *ma-00al-, cf.

Hoch (l.c.) and D. Meeks (l.c.) failed to consider RowiIska’s (1992) paper.
nb1: As pointed out by C. Brockelmann (1932, 107, #36) and H. GyZry (1990, 4,
#8), PSem. *n0l “Getreide sieben” [Aro 1964, 476; Tyloch 1975, 58, #26] has also
a genetic re#ection in Eg. nqr “(durch)sieben” (OK, Wb II 344, 7–10) in spite of
the irregular correspondence of Eg. -q- vs. Sem. *-0- (for other etymologies of Eg.

nb2: V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED #1713) falsely compared Akk. ma00alu with
Eg. mhn “box” (!) deriving both from an irreal PAA *ma0al- “box, basket” (sic!)

#1340: Eg. 0nt < *0mt via partial assim. of the labial *-m- to dental -t and the
met. of *0tm ~ Akk. 0u99immu “snout” [AHW 362], PBHbr. %.93m “the distinctive
feature of the face, nose, nostril” [ Jastrow 1950, 431], Ar. 0a9m- “bec, museau” [BK
I 596] = “snout, muzzle” [Alb.]. (3) There is a long tradition of comparing Eg. 0nt
with WCh.: Hausa hán'í, pl. hántú-nà “nose” [Abr. 1962, 369] (Eg.-Hs. supported
by Behnk 1928, 140, #38; Vcl. 1934, 71; Old. 1952, 38; 1956, 12; 1960, 800; IS

#13A; 1991, 160, §18). False, because (as pointed out in JI 1994 I, 129) the Hausa
form can be divided into the ha- pre"x of body parts + Ch. *-ntin/r “nose”. This
Eg.-Hausa comparison was rightly rejected already by N. Pilszczikowa (1958, 99), who
identi"ed in Hausa hán'í the well-known Hausa pre"x ha- occuring in Ch. names
of body parts (Takács 1997, 255–260). (4) Hodge (1981, 373, #30; 1983, 37; 1985,
18; 1990, 646, #13A; 1991, 160, §18) combined the alleged Eg.-Hausa parallel with
Ar. 0nn “to speak nasally”, which contains no match for the Eg. C3. In addition, the
basic sense of Eg. 0nt is “front”, not “nose”. (5) Hodge (1985, 18; 1990, 646, #13A):
Eg. & Hausa ~ SCu. *ntse “in front” [Ehret]. (6) Bla&ek (1994 MS Bed., 19): ~
Bed. *hanat “before” [Blz.] attested in hánat-"3wi “forenoon”, cf. "3wi “noon”. (7)
Its long-range (Nst.) comparison (often with the inclusion of Hausa hantii) with PIE
*Hant- “Vorderseite, Stirn”, loc. *Hanti “im Angesicht, Gegenüber” [IEW 48–49]
has been maintained by several scholars (Forrer 1930, 243, #3; Ivanov 1965, 15–16;
1966, 106–107, fn. 9; IS 1966, 336, #8.4; Hodge 1968, 20; 1981, 373, #30; 1983,

n. 15). It is not possible in the framework of this dictionary to judge this proposal
pointing far beyond the limits of AA. (8) Zyhlarz (1934–5, 253) combined it with
ONub. koant(i) Vorfahr”. Genetic cognacy excluded. The rest of the etymologies
for Eg. 0nt are clearly absurd. (9) Homburger (1930, 283): Eg. m0nt (!) ~ Ful Vari
“visage”. (10) Lacau (1970, 49) : Eg. 0nt < *0nr ~ *0nj (!) ~ Ar. na0ara “ron#er,
reni#er”, man0ar- “narine” mentioned as “pure hypothèse”. (11) Hodge (1991, 160,

nb3: W. Erichsen (DG 153:8) explained Dem. mj4l “Gießform des Töpfers” from
Eg. m4r. Semantically highly doubtful. Cf. also Eg. mn0 “Meißel” (Wb, q.v.).
! Origin highly disputed. GT: nevertheless, it is dif"cult to ignore its risky albeit semantically perfect comparison with OHbr. m2g$r3(h) “Vorratskammer”, cf. *mamgur3(h), pl. mamgur.t “Vorratshaus, Kornspeicher” [GB 397] = m2g$r3(h) “grain pit, storage room” [KB 544], MHbr. m2g$r3(h) “1. Vorratshaus, Speicher, Magazin, 2. Behältniss, Fach, bes. Wasserbehälter” [Levy 1924 III, 14] = m2g$r3(h) “1. store-room, bin for wheat, "gs, etc., 2. reservoir, 3. pericarp of nuts, almonds etc., 4. drupe” [ Jastrow 1950, 727] = m2g$/.r3(h) “grain pit, storage room” [KB], JPAram. mgr “to store” [Sokoloff 1990, 291], whose Sem. background is uncertain.
nb: There have been proposed the most diverse Sem. etymologies for the Hbr. word.
(1) Perhaps the most realistic opinion has been formulated in GB l.c.: “ein auch im
nhebr. vorkommendes Wort unklarer Wz.: viell. mgr?”. (2) Jastrow (l.c.) explained it from
Hbr. grr qal “to drag away” [KB 204] associated with Hbr. g.ren “threshing-#oor”
[KB 203] and PBHbr. & JAram. g$rn3(h) “gathering of rain water, reservoir” [ Jas
trow 1950, 227], which is rather unlikely. (3) Sokoloff (l.c.) treated JPAram. mgr
as a secondary root stemming from Hbr. )"gr “to bring in (the harvest)” [KB 11].
(4) KB l.c.: fem. form of Hbr. *m3g.r “1. Aufenthalt, 2. Wohnung” [GB 397] =
“grain pit, storage room” [KB 544], which, in turn, has been derived in KB l.c.
from an unattested Hbr. *gwr IV [KB 185] ~ OSA gwr “name of a grave” [Mül
ler], Ar. 6wr II: 6awwara “to hollow out” > Ar. mu6awwar- & 6$r-at- “drain, pit”
[KB]. This would replace the old derivation of Hbr. *m3g.r from )gwr I qal “sich
als Gast und Schützling irgendwo niederlassen, dann allg.: wohnen” [GB 134]
(suggested, e.g., in GB 397).
nb2: The derivation of LEg. mgrt “Gruben” (q.v., suggested in GB l.c.) from the
Can. word is doubtful.
! Other etymologies are either less attractive or clearly false: " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 15), followed by P. Wilson (PL 457) and R. Hannig (ÄWb I 556) derived it from Eg. 4r “unter” via a pre"x mof the nomina loci, lit. “place which contains” (PL). On the other hand, F. von Calice (1936, #638) assumed a derivation from Eg. 4rj.t “Bedarf ”. Both suggestions are false.
nb: OK m0r has not too much in common with OK 4r “under”, which is revealed
by their fully different orthographies. Although the development of OEg. m0r > MEg.
m4r may have indeed been in#uenced by a contamination with 4r “under”, it could
have only been secondary with no bearing on the ultimate origin of OK m0r.
" 2. S. Birch (1868, 9) noted its resemblance to the Numidian magalia huts or cottages, cf. Lat. m3g3lia “runde (fahrbare) Hütten nomadisierender Berberstämme” [LEW II 9].
nb: This word (of Punic origin) was associated in the LEW (l.c.) with diverse
alternative Sem. etymologies: (1) Hbr. ma«g3l “Geleise, Weg (eig. wo man fährt)”
[Lewy] = “waggon track, "rm path” [KB 609] after Lewy (KZ 59, 189); (2) Ser
vius suggested a dubious derivation from Punic magar (sic) “villa” [Servius cited
in LEW] = mager (sic) [Placidus apud Goetz quoted by Harris], for which cf. Lat.
M3g3ria “Vorstadt Karthagos”, which Z. S. Harris (1936, 92) identi"ed with Phn.
m#r 513



*mgr “country house, farm” [Harris] derived )g(w)r > Phn. gr “temple dweller”
[Harris] ~ Ar. 63r- “voisin” [BK I 352]; (3) P. Schroeder (1869, 104) combined it
with Hbr. m2«3r3(h) “cave” [KB 615]. The Hbr. word was quoted in LEW with the
false comment that this “stammt aus” (sic) a certain Ar. ma3arr-at- (sic), for which cf.
instead Ar. ma33r-at- “1. caverne, 2. gîte (de gazelle)” [KB II 517].
" 3. W. F. Albright (1918, 232, #50, quoted also in GÄSW #638) and A. Ember (1930, #10.a.21) equated it with Hbr. %omer “Haufe” [GB 242] = “heap” [KB 330], JAram. %mr “aufhäufen” [GB], and even with Akk. b5t 0amri ša Adad “heiliger Bezirk des Adad” [AHW 318] = “sacred precinct (of Adad)” [CAD 0, 70] = “treasure house of Adad” [Alb.], Ar. 0mr “couvrir, envelopper, cacher, etc.” [BK I 630]. False.
nb: Although, in theory, the Eg. met. *0mr > *m0r would be possible, Ar. 0mr is
unrelated to Sem. *%mr, for which cf. better Ar. %amara IV “2. ramasser, réunir de
tous côtés” [BK I 489]. In addition, Sem. *% + Eg. 0.
" 4. G. Conti (1978, 98–99, 147, 157) explained MEg. m4r as a “forbidden or restricted area” and compared it with Sem. *%rm “coprire” [Conti] (quoted also by P. Vernus 1986, 143, n. n with doubts). False. Rightly rejected already by A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 98, fn. 5).
nb1: Attested in Hbr. %1rem “(what is) ban(ned)” [KB 354], Phn. %rm “to devote,
consacrate” [Harris 1936, 104], Ar. %arama “éloigner, repousser, défendre, prohiber,
déclarer illicite”, %aram- “chose illicite, défendue, chose sacrée etc.” [BK I 1413–4]
etc. Note that Akk. (OAss./OBab.) 0ar3mu > (LBab.) ar3mu ~ er1mu “bedecken”
[AHW 323] cannot belong here as Conti claimed. For Sem. *%rm cp. rather Akk.
(LBab.) 0ar3mu “absondern” [AHW 323].
nb2: With regard to OEg. -0-, the suggested correspondece of Eg. m0r and Sem.
*%rm is not acceptable.
" 5. A.Ju. Militarev (1989, 129, #3; 1990, 34, #3; Mlt.-Stl. 1990, 74) assumed a common origin of Eg. m4r with Brb. *m-g-r “to reap” [Mlt.], which he af"liated with clearly unrelated roots such as Ar. ma0ara “3. introduire de l’eau dans un morceau de terre en y pratiquant des rigoles, des sillons” [BK II 1072] = “to till the land” [Mlt.], and others (discussed below), whereby he reconstructed PAA *mi-0aru “to reap, pick up (corn)”. Only the Brb.-Eg. comparison is plausible.
nb1: The Brb. root is attested in NBrb.: Shilh mger “moissonner, faucher” [ Jst.

í-mger “sickle” [Prd. 1960, 165].
nb2: The Ar. root, in turn, primarily means “1. fendre, sillonner l’eau, 2. fendre
les vagues, sillonner l’onde avec bruit” [BK], which excludes its comparison with
Eg. m0r.
" 6. A.Ju. Militarev (l.c.) af"liated it also with WCh.: AS *=2$r “to
gather, heap” [GT 2004, 209] = *k2ur [Stl. 1972, 182] = *g1ur “to
gather (intr.) ('!$3/)*.':)” [Stl. 1977] = *g1ur “'!$3/)*.':” [Stl.
1987, 243, #45] | Bole gar “to collect harvest” [Mlt.].
nb1: The AS root is attested in Angas gur “1. to collect in great numbers, 2. a great
gathering or assembly” [Flk. 1915, 191] = túr (K) “assembly” [ Jng. 1962 MS], Sura
kùur “Versammlung, Zusammenkunft, Menge, Masse”, kuur “sich versammeln”
[ Jng. 1963, 71], Mpn. kùur “gathering, congregation” [Frj. 1991, 29], Gmy. =ur
“to heap up, form a heap” [Srl. 1937, 108] = kur “1. heap, 2. to (make a) heap”
[Hlw. 2000 MS, 17] (AS: Stl. 1972, 182; 1987, 225, #740 & 243, #45).
nb2: The WCh. root is is akin to Sem.: Hbr. "gr qal “in Vorrat legen, für die Zukunft
sammeln” [GB 8] = “to bring in (the harvest)” [KB 11] = “to gather (food), gather
in” [Kogan] !!! ECu. *gur- “to pick up, collect” [Sasse 1982, 86] as suggested by
L. Kogan & O. Stolbova (1994 MS, 2, #14).
nb3: It would be tempting to combine the Hbr.-ECu.-WCh. isogloss (leading to
AA *g-r “to collect” [GT]) with a hypothetic Eg. *0r “to gather” (with an irregular
correspondence of Eg. 0 vs. AA *g), whereby Eg. m0r could be regarded a nomen
loci (*“place where corn is heaped up”?).
" 7. A.Ju. Militarev (1989, 129, §3), on the other hand, combined it also with WCh.: Angas *!gy232r < AS **y32r “granary, storehouse”
[GT 2004, 99]. Unlikely, since Angas *!gy
2- < AS **y- < AA *9- and
perhaps also *ç/æ/*- (cf. Takács 2003, 116).
nb: Attested in Angas gyeer ~ yeer “a store house, but especially used of a woman’s
grain store” [Flk. 1915, 197, 307] = ’géer ~ (KS) ’gyéer “Speicher” [ Jng. 1962 MS]
= *yer ~ *yer Hut “granary” [ALC 1978, 15] = gyer “barn, granary” [Gcl. 1994,

from the outside, it used to be accessible only to the head [man] of the household,
now women can take grain from this granary as well)” [Frj. 1991, 17], Msr. *yaar
“granary made of mud or corn-bin”, *yaar kaham “granary built together with a
house” [Dkl. 1997 MS, 380].
" 8. GT: the connection to NBrb.: Izn. & Wrg. a-n3ur “1. (only Izn.) cour, 2. enclos fait de branchages épineux, servant de parc à troupeaux” [Rns.], Amr. & Bq. a-n3ur “partie surélevée du sol de la chambre rifaine où sont parqués les ovins et caprins, qui y montent par des marches” [Rns. 1932, 395] is also uncertain, since we should assume Brb. *-n3Vr < *-m3Vr.
m#r 515



nb1: Alternatively, the Brb. root might be compared (via met.) with LECu.: Orm.
g.ran-./a “small granary” [Gragg 1982, 181] = g.ran-. “granary, grain store”
[Hds. 1989, 72] !!! ES: Amh. goranno “place for animals in house” [Gragg]?
nb2: The etymological relationship with SBrb.: Hgr. i-n3er “ravin (af#uent ou
sous-af#uent d’un ’vallée’, en montagne)” [Fcd. 1951–2, 1409], EWlm. a-n32r “1.

p.ext. creux (en gén., p.ex. creux laissé après la perte d’un oeil)” [PAM 2003, 606]
is also unlikely.

Although its origin has been highly debated in Eg. philology, most convincing is the ingenious observation by W. Vycichl (DELC 132) on its kinship with Bed. o"mehél “die Medizin” [Munzinger] = emhe
lána “Artz” [Seetzen] = m(e)h1l “1. (einen Kranken) p#egen, 2. (m) Arznei” [Almkvist 1885, 46] = mehÉl ~ emhÉl “Arzenei, Heilmittel”, emh1l “heilen, einen Kranken p#egen” [Rn. 1895, 166] = meh1l “to dose, treat medically, tend sick”, m2h1l (m) “medicine, medical treatment” [Rpr. 1928, 215].
nb1: A late borrowing (Cpt. < Bed.) is not improbable, although Eg. *-0- < Bed.
-h- could not be suf"ciently explained in this case. On the other hand, Eg. -0- vs.
Bed. -h- in genetic cognates is plausible.
nb2: The AA etymology of Bed. )m-h-l is not yet clear (the various Ar. parallels
suggested by L. Reinisch l.c. are all weak and unconvincing). Note that SBrb.: EWlm.

related, being a late borrowing from WCh.: Hausa máágàníí “a remedy, medicine,
prophylactic, a prevention” [Brg. 1934, 743].

this comparison also to Akk. sap30u “to scatter” (so also Ember 1930, §9.a.13, §15.

nb2: Although the Sem., LECu., and WCh. nominal parallels are mostly treated
as loans, not cognates, it is dif"cult to explain all verbal comparanda as denom. verbs
(this is probably the case with Qemant and Saho). With respect to the widespread
Sem. attestation, Th.O. Lambdin (1953, 151) has supposed a very early (2nd mill.
B.C.) borrowing from Eg., while Y. Muchiki (1994, 126, #1) considered Phn. %tm
a much later (9/8th cent. B.C.) borrowing from Eg. distinct (!) from the rest of Sem.

cf. Kurth 2003, 252, fn. 45). But his explanation for why the prep. 4r is written in
a form throughout the text conceivably different from that used in our word (“dem
kann ich vorerst nur die Möglichkeit entgegenhalten, daß der Schreiber dieses seltenen Wortes ent
weder die beiden ähnlichen Zeichen aufgrund einer indistinkten Vorlage verwechselt hat oder bloß
er bewußt differenzieren wollte, wofür sich Beispiele anführen lassen”) is not fully convincing
and satisfactory and this poses the most serious obstacle in the way of accepting
Kurth’s etymology (below).
nb2: Kurth’s (2003, 247, fn. 7) statement, that “das Wort !ndet sich auch nicht bei . . .
P. Wilson, A Ptolemaic Lexikon . . .”, is incorrect (cf. PL 475).
nb3: G. Sauneron (l.c.), J. ,erný (CED 182–3), and P. Wilson (PL 475) have com
bined Dem. mŸbl with Cpt. (S) tbhl, (B) qbhl, (?) qbal “fold (?) for sheep” (CD
400b) = “1. Hürde, Stall (für Schafe), 2. Gitter, Gatter, 3. Ge#echt, Weidenkorb,
Schutzdach” (KHW 222, 545) = “enclos (de brebis)” (DELC 211: “mot apparemment
isolé”), which, if correct, would make us maintain the old rdg. Dem. mŸbl after
Spiegelberg. Besides, J. Osing (NBÄ 202, 735–7, n. 890), W. Westendorf (KHW
l.c.), and W. Vycichl (DELC l.c.) eventually explained the Cpt. form from Eg. )dbn
(act. *)dbl), cf. esp. Eg. dbn “runder Kasten” (Wb V 437, 16).
! Reading of C2 and origin disputed. In spite of the lengthy (albeit
not perfectly convincing) analysis devoted to this lexeme by D. Kurth (2003), one is disposed to agree rather with F. de Cenival (1988, 106) on that “le mot n’est pour l’instant pas élucidé”.
" 1. W. Spiegelberg (l.c.), with right hesitation, assumed it to represent an m- pre"x nomen instr. of Ass. tab3lu “wegnehmen, wegtragen, an sich reißen, entführen” [AHW 1297].

" 2. G. Sauneron (RdE 15, 1963, 51f.), J. ,erný (CED 182–3), and P. Wilson (PL 475) compared the Dem. word (with -Ÿ-) as well as Cpt. (S) tbhl (above) with Eg. mtbr “champ de bataille” (GR: Edfu III 136:5, Sauneron l.c.) and even with Cpt. (SA) tbhr, (B) qrhb (sic) (m) “blow with foot, kick” (CD 401a) ignoring the anomalous third root consonants and the signi"cantly differing meanings, which has been rightly abandoned by W. Vycichl (l.c.) and correctly rejected by D. Kurth (2003, 247, fn. 7: “paßt hinsichtlich der Semantik keineswegs”). " 3. D. Kurth (2003, 247, 251, 253–4) explained it as a late borrowing from Hbr. mikm3r “Netz für das Einfangen von Landtieren (eig. Mittel, womit man überwältigt; gewöhnlich Netz, aber besser: Gehege mit Gruben, in denen die Gazellen gefangen werden)”, which can be semantically clearly opposed to fem. mikmeret “Netz für den Fischfang”. This theory is not fully certain on all points (above).
nb1: Kurth (2003, 253) preferred to explain Dem. -4- as a re#ection of the con
temporary spirantized -z- („begadkefat”) instead of assuming here the late (GR)
interchange of Eg. k ~ 0. Nevertheless, the fem. Can. term appears already in
LEg. as mkmrt (GW) with -k- (hapax: Amenemope 7:6, below). He explained this
anomaly with the more than 800 years time gap between the Dem. form vs. LEg.
mkmr.t (GW, discussed below), which “aus einer Zeit stammt, in welcher der betreffende
Laut vielleicht noch wie ein Verschlußlaut gesprochen wurde” (Kurth 2003, 254, cf. also fn.
62: “für wahrscheinlicher halte ich jedoch eine späte Wiederentlehnung mit innersemitisch geänderter
Ausprache, nachdem das Wort zwischenzeitlich in Ägypten außer Gebrauch gekommen wäre”).
nb2: For Eg. the interchange of Eg. m ~ b, Kurth (2003, 254, fn. 63) provided us
with an abundant lit., but he failed to satisfactorily explain the anomaly of Dem.
-l vs. Can. -r.
m' n “Art Stock oder Szepter” (PT, Wb II 133, 11; GHWb 359; ÄWb I 555) = “un bâton de voyage du type ordinaire” ( Jéquier 1921, 342) = “sorte de canne” ( Jéquier 1921, 167 & fn. 5) = “un bâton” (AL 77.1850).
nb1: W. Westendorf (KHW 111, 522, cf. AL 77.1850) af"liated it with Cpt. (B)
maJoul “Meißel, Beitel, Spitzhammer” and eventually even with Dem. mj4l
“Gießform des Töpfers” (explained in DG 153:8 from Eg. m4r), while J. Osing
(NBÄ 186, 581, n. 483 & 711, n. 825) saw the etymon of the Cpt. word rather in
Eg. mn0 “Meißel” (OK, Wb, q.v.), which is semantically equally uncertain.
nb2: G. Jéquier (1921, 167 & fn. 5) identi"ed it with MK mn0.t (< OK m«n0.t
“gegabelter Stock”, q.v.), which was rightly declined by J. Osing (1980, 224, fn. 66)
with regard to -4- + -0- and the gender difference.
! Etymology unknown. " 1. G. Jéquier (1921, 167 & fn. 5; 1921, 147) derived it (via the pre"x m- of nomina instr.) from Eg. 0n “s’arrêter, se reposer”, whence he rendered its lit. mng. as “un objet servant à se reposer”. False because of OK -4- + -0-. " 2. GT: perhaps to be connected with Geez m2%n ~ ma%n “shuttle, length of the warp, weaver’s reed”, Amh. mähan ~ m2h2n ~ män “weaver’s reed” (ES: Lsl. 1987, 336)?

nb1: In A. H. Gardiner’s (AEO II 217*–8*, §466) view, the exact mng. of m4n is
unknown, the sense “schlammige Stelle” (Wb) being “certainly not de!nitive enough to

#55). This is phonologically impossible, rightly declined by W. A. Ward (1972, 19).
nb: Lacau, at the same time, was admitting also the popular derivation from Eg.
jmj-4.t. Besides, the m- of Sem. *ma«y- is not at all a pre"x.
" 3. A. B. Dolgopolsky (1992 MS, 316, §30) af"liated Eg. *4t with Sem. *0y9 “to sew” and its “long-range” cognates: IE *H1ter “Eingeweide (Ader usw.)” [Dlg. after IEW 344], Turkic *e/ät- “to sew, tie” < Nst. *qe/ä9V “to tie, thread”. " 4. N. Skinner (1995, 31) derived it from AA *«and- “intestines”. False.
" 5. GT: is it perhaps an irregular cognate of Ar. mi«d-at- ~ ma«id
at- “estomac”, cf. ma«ad- “1. côté, #anc, 2. ventre, 3. chair sous les
omoplates, 4. veine dans la partie du corps appelée minsa6- chez le cheval” [BK II 1126] = mi«d-at- ~ ma«id-at- “1. estomac, 2. caillette,
quatrième estomac des animaux ruminants, 3. gros boudin fait avec des oeufs” [Dozy II 602] !!! LECu.: Afar ma%d-a (f), pl. ma%d.di “entrails, internal organs, innards, viscera” [PH 1985, 161] !!! SOm.: Dime mo3du “brain” [Bnd. 1994, 146]? Note that AA *m«d > Eg.
*m0d would be reg. (cf. EDE I 326–7), whereby Eg. )m<t might be conceived as a root var.
nb1: The Ar. word was af"liated in HSED 371, #1708 with ECh.: Jegu medet “belly”
(sic, not so in Jng. 1961, 115) and even CCh.: BM *mi*- “liver” [GT] = *mVhid
[OS] (all derived from AA *ma«id- “stomach”), which seems rather unlikely. This
set of dubious comparanda was combined by V. A. Dybo (2000, 53) with Saharan
*(k2)-matkun “liver”. Irreal.
nb2: Hardly any connection to Akk. m3tu “u.a. 5. ein bestimmter Teil der Ober#äche

mz ~/< mz3 “herbeibringen, -tragen, -führen, -schleppen, (Hand) hinstrecken” (OK, Wb II 135, 7; Erman 1910, 36–38, §iv) = “to bring with, carry” (Badawy 1956–57, 67) = “to bring, present to (n), bring away booty, extend hand, take aim” (FD 116) = “1. to bring, present, offer, 2. launch (a vessel)” (DLE I 238; Jones 1988, 215, §36) = “herbeibringen, -tragen, -schaffen, entgegenstrecken und rasseln, hinstrecken” (GHWb 360).
nb1: Its rare older (?) var. mz3 (PT 85) may re#ect the full root (cf. Wb II 136, 3;
FD; GHWb l.c.).
nb2: The wtg. (since NK) as mzb ~ mzbj ~ even mzbbj (sic) represents “nur eine
orthographische Verdrehung ” (Erman 1910, 47), which “nach Analogie von zbj ‘bringen’ gebildet
ist” (Sethe 1912, 81 & fn. 2), as it has been surmised already by P. Renouf (1868, 48):
“I cannot believe that in mzbbj the b is otherwise than ideographic (sic) of the sound mas”.
The view of G. Thausing (1941, 25), that these exx. in fact represent either a root
extended with -b or a verbum conjunctum (< mz + zbj), is erroneous.
nb3: OCpt. mas- (part. conj.) “bringen, schaffen, hervorrufen” may re#ect the part.
of either Eg. mz(3) or msj (KHW 520).
nb4: The derivation of LEg. tmz (or tms) “(das Gesicht) zuwenden jemandem (r/n)”
(XVIII., GR, Wb V 308, 14–15) from mz suggested by Ch. Cannuyer (1983, 28)
is dubious.
! Hence (?): mz “Blumenstrauß (zumeist die eigentümlichen sogen. Stabsträuße)” (XIX., Wb II 136, 1; Kaplony 1972, 223: "rst attested in Abusir; WD III 56 with lit.) = “elaborate garlands made of white #owers, or woven of separate petals” (Grif"th 1898, 27) = “bouquet” (XVIII., FD 117) = “bouquet monté, offrande #orale” (OK: Abusir, PK 1976, 414, n. d; AL 77.1856; 79.1337) = “1.

nb1: Rendered literally as “das Dargebrachte” (Erman) = “das Herbeigebrachte”
(Grapow). For its supposed derivation from Eg. mz(3) see Erman 1910, 39; PL 459;
Koemoth 1997, 153 & fn. 29. Note that H. Grapow (1914, 28) derived it directly
(!) from *zwj (sic) “Verb des Gehens” (via pre"x m-), which is certainly incorrect.
The same partains to the far-fetched idea of F.L. Grif"th (1898, 27) to derive mz
(rendered lit. “arti"cial”) from msj “to produce children” (supported also by P. Wilson
in PL 459) and (!) even late mzb (sic) < zbj “to bring, offer”.
nb2: The form described as “Stabstrauß” suggests to assume alternatively a con
nection to Eg. mz.t “Art Stab des Osiris” (NK, Wb, q.v.).
! Etymology disputable. " 1. Most convincing seems the comparison with the re#exes of WSem. *msr “1. to remove, 2. deliver, hand over” [Hnrg. 2000, 2065] suggested by Th. Schneider (1993, 168; 1997, 198, §37).

“enlever une inscription, un monument” [Arbach 1993 MS, 71] (Sem.: Voigt 1998,
174, 177). The OSA evidence (ms1r) re#ects a PSem. var. *mšr [GT].
nb2: WSem. *msr has no evident re#ex in ESem. The connection with Akk. muššuru
D “wegschicken, aufgeben” [Haupt] (suggested in GB 441) is out of question, this
being a var. to wuššuru < wšr. R.M. Voigt (1998, 177) compared Akk. mšr “(auf
dem Boden) schleifen” [AHW 624] = “1. to teasel cloth, 2. drag (over the ground),
3. make an impression of the hem on clay, 4. drive around” [CAD m1, 359], which
is semantically weak.
nb3: A. Guillaume (1965 I, 11) af"liated Hbr. msr with Ar. slm IV: "aslama “to deliver
up”, which is far-fetched (met. + -r vs. -l- unlikely). M. Bravmann (1977, 513f.), in
turn, assumed NWSem. *msr to have originally been a denom. verb from a *ma
pre"x derivative of Sem. *)"sr “to bind, tie”, i.e., the underlying basis was a noun
attested in JAram. m1s3r3 ~ m1sart3 “truss (of herbs)” [Levy 1924 II, 179b], Syr.
m1s3rt3 (Nestorian tradition: m1s3rt3) ~ m1sar “truss (of herbs), shackle (vinculum)”
[Brk.], Geez ma"s2/ar ~ ma"sart “shackle (vinculum)” [Bravmann]. Semantically
far-fetched. In addition, the OSA cognates also disprove this theory.
" 2. GT: or should we assume a met. < *m3z/*mlz ~ Ar. malaza I “emporter qqch., partir en emportant qqch.”, II “délivrer qqn. de qqch.”, IV “s’en aller en emportant qqch.” [BK II 1147]?
nb: Derived by Ch. Ehret (1989, 182, §55) from a hypothetic bicons. Ar. *ml- “to
remove”.
" 3. Other (phonologically equally plausible) alternatives are semantically less likely.
nb: Such as (1) Hbr. mzr qal “to spread (a net)” [KB 566], JAram. mzr “to stretch
o’self out” [KB], Ar. mzr “3. détendre et faire gon#er (p.ex. une outre en la rem
plissant d’eau, etc.)” [BK II 1099] = “to stretch out, in#ate (skin)” [KB], cf. Ar.
m3r II “disperser, disséminer”, IV “être dispersé, disseminé de tous les côtés” [BK

Eg. mz was the primary root, cp. NAgaw: Hamir mizez “(heraus)ziehen (Schwert
usw.), zerren” [Rn. 1884, 396].
! Other etymologies are not acceptable. " 4. An etymological connection (maintained by some egyptologists) with Eg. *zj “gehen?” (Wb III 424, 13) = zwj (sic) “Verb des Gehens” (Grapow) = z (sic) “to bring, come” (sic, Reintges) > j.zj “gehe!” (OK, Wb I 126, 8) can be safely excluded because of the meaning.
lit.: Ceugney 1880, 8; Grapow 1914, 28; Thausing 1941, 25; Reintges 1994, 226.
" 5. It is obscure why I. M. Diakonoff (1981, 43, fn. 52) related Eg. mz3 “to bring” with such Afro-Asiatic forms as Akk. mzy “to press”, (D) “to force, insult, debase, rape”, Ar. mzz “to overcome, keep one’s own (in contest)” !!! Bed. maykwa [< *mazikwa?] “dexter” !! ECu. *mizg- “dexter”.



" 6. Ch. Ehret (1995, 305, #584): Eg. mz3 ~ Ar. m3l “to make known a secret” !!! ECu. *mi/u/a'- “to stick out, come forth” !!! NOm.: Gonga *m.''- “young grain” < AA *-mu/a‰- “to come forth, emerge, stick out”. These comparanda are even mutually unrelated.
nb1: At the same time, Ehret (1995, 303, #577) af"liated LEg. ms “to launch” with
Ar. mKh “to set out on a journey” and Cu. *maæ- “to get up” < AA *-maæ- “to start”.

mz.t “Art Stab des Osiris” (NK, BD, Wb II 136, 2; GHWb 360) = “a staff ” (FD 116) = “Stab, ein Krummstab” (Hornung 1963 II, 27–28, §81 & 87, §305) = “eine Bez. des Krummstabes” (Kaplony, LÄ VI 1386, n. 71: already CT V 90f.).
nb1: Its occurence in CT V 90f (suggested by P. Kaplony l.c.) was rendered by R. O.
Faulkner (AECT II 29, spell 397, n. 25) as a corruption of ms2w “offspring”.
nb2: The supposed connection to Eg. mz “Blumenstrauß (zumeist die eigentümlichen

M. F. L. MacAdam (1949, 11, n. 44) as a vessel named after the food (Eg. mzw.t)
it contained (cf. Edel 1980, 14, fn. 8). For the problem of its alleged cuneiform

But the Hbr. has been explained in KB l.c. as a loan-word of entirely different basic

A.Ju. Militarev (1995, 118, #4), in turn, af"liated the Eg.-PNBauchi isogloss with

graithmayr & Takács 2000):
(1) The most widespread view is that Eg. zwr is cognate with common Berbero

cf. Brb. *š-w-y “to drink” [Rsl. 1964, 208] = *s-w-Õ [Rsl. 1987, 385] = *s-w-y [Vcl.

1994, 104–105; 1994, 230; 1994, 444–6. All these scholars overlooked or ignored
that Eg. voiced z- (as pointed out already by F. Hommel 1882, 10) does not regularly
correspond to the initial voiceless sibilants in Brb. and Ch., and, more importantly,
that there is no match of Eg. -r. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, l.c.) tried to justify the recon
struction of Brb. *-r by a comparison to the isolated Snus agricultural term e-ss$r
(sic) “tränken”, which must be in fact an error for a-sure3, verbal noun of sure3
“to bring to the watering place, to water”, causative of ured < Arabic warada “to
arrive (at a watering place or wird)” (kind p.c. by K.-G. Prasse, 24 Jan. 2007). The
similarity of Eg. zwr to CCh.: Tera (connecting stem) za-rá < )za “to drink” [Nwm.
1964, 47] < PCh. *sw- is also misleading. W. M. Müller (1909, 185), in turn, tried
to justify the Eg.-Brb. comparison by explaining Eg. -r as a false archaization of the
orthography, but it can hardly be accepted in this case because of the hrgl. wr (G36)
in the word. This etymology of Eg. zwr has been already rightly doubted by F. Hintze
(1951, 81: “unwahrscheinlich”), C.T. Hodge (1976, 23, #127), and even W. Vycichl
(1990, 227: “il semble dif!cile de comparer l’ég. zwr avec le berbère su et le haoussa sâ . . .”).
Moreover, O. V. Stolbova (HSED #1300; Stl. 1996, 58) has recently convincingly
identi"ed the Brb.-Ch. isogloss *s-w-y/H with Ar. %sw “boire en humant (l’eau),
absorber par petites gorgées, humer la soupe” [BK I 429] = “to sup, sip, drink by
little and little” [Lane 572] = “to drink by small gulps” [Stl.], cf. also Mehri %sw:
%2s$ “to dig for water, make a water-hole”, Jibbali %sy: EJibbali %sé & CJibbali
%asé “to dig for water” (MSA: Johnstone 1981, 116; 1987, 189). Thus the Brb.
Ch. root may be traced back to AA *s-w-% ~ *%-s-w “to drink” [GT], which de"
nitely rules out the problematic equation of Brb.-Ch. *s-w-H with Eg. zwr > zwj.
This is con"rmed also by the long-range parallels of the Ar.-Brb.-Ch. root, to
which add NOm.: Gimirra s. “Wasser” [Cohen 1947, #296], cf. IE *sew-/*s$
“1. moist(ure), 2. to gulp, suck” [IEW 912], Kart. *s1w- “to drink” (suggested by
A. Dolgopol’skij 1970, 622; 1990, 219). W. W. Müller (1975, 69, #68) and Th.
Obenga (1993, 320–322, #69) related the Chadic root to NOm. *uš- “to drink”
[GT] (with met.), although the SOm. evidence indicates that the sibilant was
deglottalized in NOm., cf. Ari woæ-, Hamer w2æ-a, Dime w¦æ- “to drink” (Bender
1994, 148, #20).
(2) A. Erman (1892, 117, with hesitation) and M. Cohen (1947, #296) compared
Eg. zwr with Sem.: Hbr. sb" “trinken, zechen”, though none of the root consonants
corresponds. Besides, Hbr. sb" is cognate with Ch. *s-H [*-H < *-b"] “to suck, drink”
[Nwm. 1977, 32]. See SISAJa III, 20, #32; HSED #403 (Sem.-Ch.). R. M. Voigt
(1998, 610) did not exclude the Urverwandtschaft of Hbr. sb" & Ch. *s2-H/*s2-b2
“saugen” [ JI] with Brb.-Ch. *s-w- “to drink”.
(3) A. Ember (1911, 90; 1926, 302, fn. 10, 305, #3.1; 1930, #6.d.3), in turn,
combined Eg. zwr with Sem. *Grb ~ *Grp: PBHbr. (Talmud) Grp “to sip”, Syr. srp
“to suck in, absorb”, Ar. šariba “to drink, suck out”, Geez Trb “imbibere, bibere,
sorbere” (Sem.: Dlg. 1972, 169, #6; Rabin 1975, 90, 87, #19; Mlt. 1976, 24, #13).
Rightly rejected by C. T. Hodge (1976, 23, #127). Evidently irreal: Eg. z- never
corresponds to Sem. *G-, while Eg. -w- vs. Sem. *-b are also irregular. Rejected
already by C. T. Hodge (1976, 23, #127). Sem. *Grb is supposed to be cognate with
Eg. š3b.w [perhaps *šrb-w] “food, meals” (MK, FD 261) !!! WCh.: Hausa šàrHáá
“to noisily drink soup” [Abr. 1962, 802]. For Eg.-Sem.-Hs.: Ember 1930, #3.b.34;
Hodge 1966, 46, #60; 1990, 647, #17.a.
(4) H. Jungraithmayr (1977, 52–53) combined Eg. zwr and Brb. *s-w-" with Ch.
*s/š-b-r/h (?) > WCh.: Sigidi Giabur (hl-), Polchi Gir (hlir) “trinken” < *GiB-r (sic).
Phonologically equally unlikely.
(5) G. Takács (1995, 101, #3) traced it back to a bicons. Eg. *z3 ~ *zr “to #ow”
based on Eg. z3b “#ießen” (PT, Wb III 420, 3–4) and z32 “Wasser sprengen” (PT, Wb
mzwr 535



III 422, 11). Far-fetched, although there are external parallels, cf. PCh. *z-l “to pour”
[ JS 1981, 206] > e.g. WCh.: BT *(n)zalu “to pour” [Schuh 1984, 217].
(6) GT: its kinship to the isolated NBauchi *)-w-r “Wasser” [ JS 1981, 283; JI 1994
I, 176] = *[c/ç]uwar- [GT]: Warji suwara [Gowers] = ts’ùwá8á (çùwá8á) [IL] =
’sùwará [Skn.], Diri tsuwaru [Skn.] = sùwà8ú [IL] is phonologically also unlikely
(NBch. *)- < AA *ç- + Eg. z-).
(7) GT: in view of GR mswr “canal” (GR, PL), noteworthy is Sem. *swr (hardly
*Gwr) > OSA m-s3wr-t “irrigation channel” [Lsl.] = “Bewässerungskanal” [Voigt] ||
Geez maTwar(t) [irreg. T-?] “funnel, container (for oil)” [Lsl.] = “Trichter” [Voigt]
(Sem.: Müller 1983, 283; Lsl. 1987, 539; Voigt 1994, 113) – albeit the correspon
dence of the "rst radicals is irreg. and the basic sense of the underlying PSem.
root is uncertain.
mzmz “Verbum (von der Sonne)” (PT hapax, Wb II 136, 9; GHWb 363) = “sich umgürten” (ÜKAPT VI 133) = “to gird” (AEPT 180) = “(mng. unknown, simplex mz?)” (Allen 1984, 571) = “gegürtet sein” (ÄWb I 564).
nb: Occurs only in PT 1088a: mzmz=f m pšr.t “he is girt with his kilt” (AEPT) =
“he is . . . in the girdle” (Allen). The lack of det. indicates that the word was no longer
fully understood. Even the interpretation of pšr.t (hapax of PT 1088a) is equally
questionable. It is usually rendered as “ein Schurz” (ÄWb I 474), but the oldest
var. (P) has a road det. (N31), which may suggest – in principle – assuming *p4r.t
“route” (or sim.) < p4r “go around”. This would lead to a different understanding
of the passage: “he is . . . during the route (?)”. Perhaps *mzmz “to shine or burn
(???)” (or sim.). But further research is needed.
! Meaning and origin obscure. We be con"ned only to speculations. " 1. GT: should the basic mng. “to roll (up in)” (or sim.) be valid, Eg. mzmz might be linked to Sem.: Dathina mzz “spremere” [Rossi] = “to squeeze, wring (the clothes)” [Stace] = “(res)serrer, tendre” [GD 2691], Yemeni Ar. mzz I “to squeeze, press hard, wring (clothes), VIII “to recoil, contract ("ngers)” [Piamenta 1990, 464] !!! NBrb.: (?) Qbl. m-z-y: e-mzi “être rond” [Dlt. 1982, 531].
nb: NOm.: Wlt. mayz “indossare, vestire” [Crl. 1929, 33] cannot be related, the
underlying NOm. root being just *may- (cf. LS 1997, 477).
" 2. GT: if, in turn, its basic meaning has anything to do with “shining” or “burning” (or sim.), cp. perhaps NOm. *mi'- (< *mi‰-?) “to burn” [GT].

Reinisch (l.c.) erroneously connected the Kaffa root with Eth.-Sem. *mwq “to be
warm”, although the medial -5- and the "nal -‰ speak against it. M. Lamberti (l.c.),
in turn, derived the NOm. root from a hypothetic OCu. (PCu.-Om.) *bud-, which
is phonologically also unlikely.

(4) The Gk. hapax I5μe)& “the Eg. name for crocodile” (Herodotos II 69) is
usually explained from Eg. %mz (discussed below) with met. (Sethe 1899 I, §253;
Lacau 1903, 156–9, §3; Spg. KHW 65; Grapow SBAW 1938, 348; Grdseloff 1944,

(1903, 158–9) saw in I5μe)& a LEg. fem. etymon *%-mse. A. Wiedemann (quoted
by Piehl 1891, 47, fn. †) "rmly denied the connection of I5μe)& to mz%. Th.O.
Lambdin (l.c.) assumed either a scribal error or Herodot’s mishearing as “strongly

recorded a LEg. *hn-ms% with the pl. indef. article *han-, although LEg. h- > Gk.
I- is “sans précédent” (Fournet). ,erný thought to have overcome this “real dif!culty”
by assuming the frequent interchange of old h- ~ %- in Roman times to have
worked in this case also, since LEg. % > Gk. I is plausible, cf. Eg. sm%j “left” > Gk.

Bishai 1964, 46; Ward 1986, 152; Powels 1992, 196 etc.). The Ar./Bed. word has

assumed in ti- a Sem. Präformativ attested, in her view, in Hbr. t3kiyy5m (pl.) < MEg.

Orel 1993, 39) erroneously explained Ar. tims3%- (and ECh.: Mubi tumsa, which
is, in fact, a late loan from Ar.) with “haplology and metathesis” (!) from thir absurd AA
*tüm-me%as (sic) along with Eg. tšmm “crocodile” (GR), which was rightly rejected
by a number of authors like C. Peust (1997, 270), G. Takács (1997, 114; 1999,
113), I. M. Diakonoff (1998, 211, fn. 6: “a quite fantastic mental construct”, “a spurious
word-compound”), and A. Zaborski (2000, 151: “horrendous mistakes”).
nb3: The “alte Schreibung” (Wb) %mz “Krokodil” (OK, Wb III 96, 11) is attested from
the 1nd Dyn. (Qaa, cf. Czermak 1931, 27; FÄW 197) throughout in the OK-MK
(cf. Lacau 1903, 156, §3), especially frequently in the CT (cf. DCT 83). K. Sethe
(1899 I, §253), P. Lacau (1903, 158–9 & fn. 6), and W. Vycichl (1990, 130) assumed
a real metathesis, which they projected also to LEg. fem. *%åmse (Sethe) = *%-ms/
< *m-s%/ (sic) (Lacau: instead of **%ems. < **ms%.), which they based on Gk.
(hapax) I5μe)& “the Eg. name for crocodile” (Herodotos II 69). The assumption,
that this met. occured only in the OK and then again 5th cent. BC, was strongly
opposed by J. ,erný (1943, 346, §4), who stressed that P. Lacau (1903, 157) had
already shown “beyond all doubt” that the OK form %mz.t was “nothing more” than a
“métathèse apparente due à un groupment”, i.e., “due to a mere graphic grouping of the signs”
(pace AÄG 40, §93, where -% as C3 is maintained), and thus “nothing allows to assume”
an OK *%mz. H. Ranke (1925, 79) also insisted on reading the OK-MK exx. in
question as mz%. J.-L. Fournet (1989, 68, §7), in turn, emphasized that P. Lacau
538 mz"



(1903, 158) in fact accepted for LEg. fem. ms%.t a real met. *%ms.(t), at least “à un
certain moment”, via “un changement de structure phonétique du mot, dû à la présence de l’article
féminin”. Even further went A. Loprieno (LÄ V 1212, 1214, n. 40) accepting a
reverse (!) met. also for OK masc. %mz > later mz% (adducing no evidence), which
he attributed to a Sprachtabu.
! Its origin still fully hides in obscurity. W. Vycichl (1991, 119) postulated an African substratum in it (without any etymological evidence). " 1. GT: its equation with the isolated SOm.: Ari m3*a “Krokodil” [Lmb.] !!! CCh.: Logone mídeg1, pl. mídgey1 “Krokodil” [Nct. apud Lks. 1936, 109] = mÖdgê “crocodile” [Mch. 1950, 22], Kuseri mur(u)gê [Lbf. apud Slk. 1967, 231, #221] is hindered by phonological dif"culties.
nb1: The correspondences of Eg. -z- vs. Ari -*- and Ktk. -g vs. Eg. -% have not
been evidenced.
nb2: M. Lamberti (l.c.) combined the Ari ex. with NOm.: Sns.-Bworo muççà (-tts’-)
“Fisch” [Lmb.] and even HECu. *n3''a “crocodile” [Hds. 1989, 45, 419], although
the latter is just a late borrowing from LECu.: Oromo. L. Homburger (quoted in
Lbf. l.c.) assumed in Ktk. a pre"x muru- attached to *)lig-.
" 2. GT: in the Ethiopian language groups, we "nd an areal word for “crocodile”, whose common etymon could be reconstructed as *[%]azz-. This may have been the source of Eth.-Sem. *[%]azzo. Purely hypothetically, if Eth. *%azz- was due to an assimilation of a former **%amz-, it could be a plausible equivalent of Eg. %mz (OK). This theory has, however, serious drawbacks: (1) it is dubious if OK %mz was the original form, (2) the ultimate origin of the Eth. Wanderwort seems to be unknown.
nb1: Cf. Eth.-Sem.: OAmh. hazzo > Amh. azzo [Apl.], Common Gurage azzo
[Lsl.: Ø- < old *%/0- plausible] !!! NAgaw: Qemant azo [CR] | SAgaw: Awngi azz$

87; 1979 III, 119; Apl. 1977, 42).
nb2: The etymology of these data is uncertain. Anyhow, their common Sem.
background being entirely obscure, an Eth.-Sem. borrowing from Cu. (not vice
versa) seems more probable just as E. Cerulli (l.c.) and D. Appleyard (l.c.) suggested.
W. Leslau (1963) af"liated our Eth. word also with LECu.: Somali ‰á%as ~ yá%as
(southern dial.) “das Krokodil” [Rn. 1902, 187] = ‰á%?s “crocodile” [Abr. 1964,
137] > ES: Harari %3s “1. crocodile, hence: 2. gluttonous” [Lsl. 1963, 87], which
is also uncertain, since (1) the anomaly of Harari -3- and (2) Som./Harari -s as
well as (3) Som. ‰a- > ya- vs. Eth. Ø- is unexplained. In addition, (4) L. Reinisch
(l.c.) and W. Leslau (1987) combined the Som. word Geez %aga) “lizard” (also
translated “crocodile”) [Lsl.].
" 3. GT: its connection to Brb. *a-mKaH “ogre” [GT] is also unlikely. This Eg.-Brb. comparison would suggest the semantic shift “(maneating) giant” " “crocodile”.

nb2: Traditionally (cf. Bates 1914, 82; Laoust l.c.; Tf. l.c.), the Brb. word has been

E. Laoust (l.c.) recorded different sibilant (-z vs. -K)
nb3: The loss of PAA *-% is regular almost in all Brb. lgs. (Mlt. 1991, 245). But Brb.
*K < AA *æ + Eg. z. The change of AA *-z-H > Brb. *-K (on the analogy of the
compensatory glottalization in Ch. after the loss of *H) has not been evidenced.

of which can be derived . . . from *me%as”.
" 11. Ch. Ehret (1995, 304, #579) derived it (with an alleged iterative suf"x *-%) from his AA *-m.„- “to become wet” based on dubious parallels.

of its sense either, but he regarded the rendering “mélanger” or “broyer, presser”
as unlikely, there being other verbs for these meanings. Its det. (two sticks crossed,
Z9) is typical of verbs signifying separation, mixing of diverse entities etc. (EG

de fenek (petits renards)” (Lacau 1954, 45–46, §21) = “(propriamente) #agello sacrale, ma anche scacciamosche di forma simile” (Curto 1959, 249, fn. 1) = “eig. ein Gebilde aus drei zusammengesetzten Fuchsfellen” (Staehelin 1966, 165) = “drei zusammengebundene Felle kleiner Füchse, Symbol der Fruchtbarkeit” (Edel 1980, 14) = “Dreierbündel von Fuchsfellen” (Westendorf 1987, 461, fn. 16) = “an object (#ywhisk?) made of three skins of small fenek foxes, tied together” (Goldwasser 1992, 77 & fn. 42).
nb1: G. Daressy (1903, 123) found a late (Saite) form of the hrgl. neatly elaborated
on a relief and representing “trois chacals allongés, vus de haut, semblant mordre
une disque au-dessus duquel se dressent trois tiges” (Daressy) = “drei an den Köpfen
zusammen befestigte vollständige Felle kleiner Füchse – nach den langen Ohren zu
urteilen, vielleicht von Feneks” (Borchardt). The same sign is depicted twice on the
obelisk of Antonius (2nd cent. AD) appearing “als trügen drei tierische Wesen den Korb
(V32)” (Erman 1909, 92). For the rare (unique?) GR phon. value ms of the hrgl.
“drei ganze Schakale” (on a Ptol. stela) that “beruht auf einer echt ptolemäischen . . . Spielerei
des Schreibers oder Steinmetzen, der an Stelle der drei Schakalfelle drei ganze Schakale hinzeichnete”
cf. Ranke 1909, 92 (after Brugsch).
nb2: F.L. Grif"th (1898, 27) misunderstood the object originally underlying hrgl.
suggesting that it depicts “three curiously shaped bonds, apparently garlands, strings
or chains of white #owers, tied together at the top” erroneously af"liating it with
mz “garlands made of white #owers” (above) ~ mzb (!) that he eventually derived
from zbj “to bring”. Its de"nition as “#ywhisk” (developing into “#agellum”) by
L. Borchardt (l.c.) and A. C. Mace & H. E. Winlock (1916, 94f.), adopted also in
Wb (l.c.), was "rmly rejected by H. G. Fischer (LÄ II 85, n. 22 with further lit.).
Strangely, the index of LÄ (VII 467) still has ms.t “Wedel”. Sometimes confused
with the hanging part of the #agellum n0303 (Daressy 1903, 122), but their iden
tity with the #ywhisk was declined by G. Jéquier (1921, 189) stressing that the use
of ms as #agellum was due to an “adaptation secondaire”. E. Staehelin (1966, 165 &
164, fn. 8 with further lit.) presented some evidence of the hrgl. ms representing a
“Fliegenwedel”. In addition, she (o.c., p. 165, fn. 2) also maintained the old view
that “die ‘Geißel’ als bekanntes Herschaftszeichen . . . ist nicht anderes als ein Fliegenwedel”.
! Hence: ms.t “Wedel aus einem Schakalfell oder aus drei solcher Felle (der Gegenstand, den die Heroglyphe ms darstellt)” (MK, NK, Wb II 137, 2–3) = “Fuchschwanz oder meist drei Fuchschwänze als Wedel (manchmal ohne Griff, häu"ger mit einem Stiele)” (Borchardt 1907, 75–76, §1, esp. p. 76, fn. 3 with exx.) = “le groupe de trois peaux de renards qui, suspendu à un bâton (modèle primitif de #agellum)” ( Jéquier 1921, 94) = “apron of fox-skins” (Grd. 1927, l.c.; FD 116) = “chasse-mouche (parmi les objets offerts au mort) fait de peaux de ms (le fenek?)” (Lacau 1954, 45, §21, fn. 2; 1970, 64, §10, fn. 2) = “1. (in ältester Zeit hat als) Schurz für Männer (gedient), 2. Amulett in der Form der Hieroglyphe ms” (Edel 1980, 14) = “Schurz aus Fuchsfellen” (GHWb 360). Cf. also Jasnow 1994, 107, n. cc.
nb: Vocalized as *másuj.a(t) > *måsja by E. Edel (1980, 14) on the basis of the much
disputed Amarna cuneiform gloss (EA 14, 1:14) ma-šu-ja rendered “unbekannter
Gegenstand aus Gold” [KMAV 23] = “an object, implement” [Lambdin] = “ein
544 *ms



Gegäßname (aus Gold)” [Osing] = “ein leichter, am Hals zu tragender Gegenstand,
eine Art Amulett” [Edel], which is supposed to re#ect either (1) Eg. ms.t (defective
wtg. of *msj.t) “Amulett als Symbol der Fruchtbarkeit” (Edel l.c.) or (2) the pass.
pf. part. of Eg. msj (tr.) “to form, fashion”, viz. *mas†j.a(t) (Lambdin 1953, 367,
§19 with an obscure a hint on Eg. msj.t “Füllen”, XVIII., Wb II 140, 15) or (3)
or Eg. msj.t (var. msj) “Schale, Schüssel (aus Gold, Silber)” (LP, NBÄ 815) or (4)
Eg. msj3.t “Rangabzeichen” (q.v.) suggested by E. Edel (l.c.) and J. Zeidler (1998,
24–25, §2; 1999, 286). Quoting only the solution offered by Th.O. Lambdin (l.c.),
D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 100) view that for the Amarna gloss “no !nal
conclusion can be made”.
! Etymology rather debated. Most likely seems solution #1. " 1. The old view, that it may be somehow connected with Eg. msj “to give birth”, still holds.
nb: G. Jéquier (1921, 93–94) saw in the object the hrgl. ms originated in “un devanteau
primitif formé de trois peaux de renards . . . tombé hors d’usage à une époque très ancienne, . . . un objet
destiné à couvrir les parties sexuelles de l’homme, donc à protéger les organes de la reproduction”,
which symbolically could “servir à exprimer la fonction même de ces organes et être employé
pour désigner le mystère de la naissance”, and it is only hence that it became later “le
"agellum . . . l’insigne particulier de certains dieux qui, comme Min et Osiris, . . . qui personni!ent
la renaissance régulière et perpétuelle, . . . un emblème de renaissance et du puissance vivicatrice”.
L. Störk (LÄ II 348 & n. 6 with lit.) believes that “die Fuchsfelle der Hieroglyphe ms zeigt
auch für Ägypten den weitverbreiteten Zusammenhang zwischen Fuchs, Erotik und Fruchtbarkeit”.
Similarly, V. Wessetzky (1989, 426) supposed the object depicted by the hieroglyph
ms to have probably been conceived in Egypt as a protective symbol at child-birth
(“günstiges Sinnbild bei der Geburt”) arguing that “das Zeichen msj wurde der Überlieferung
nach gegebenenfalls an die Tür des Zimmers der Kreißenden oder über die Wiege gehängt. Dieser
Brauch war in Nubien auch in jüngster Vergangenheit noch lebendig”. Note that n0303 “#a
gellum” (rarely confused with the hrgl. ms, cf. above) has been also explained “as
an emblem of birth” (Fischer, LÄ II 516 & 517, n. 8).
" 2. G. Daressy (1903, 122–3) maintained its derivation from Eg. mz “Blumenstrauß” (OK, Wb, q.v.), although even he found it “not entirely satisfactory”. False both philologically and phonologically (old *ms + mz).
nb: Daressy (l.c.) eventually regarded the formerly generally accepted view, that ms
was “pris pour une triple guirlande de "eurs”(Lepsius: “végétaux” and Grif"th: “three
curiously-shaped bands, apparently garlands, strings or chans of white #owers tied
together at the top”), as still valid. Since he failed to understand “le rapport . . . entre le
groupe de trois chacals bizarrement placés et le mot mes . . . former, façonner”, he regarded it
merely as “fantaisie d’artiste” (Daressy) = “die müßige Spielerei eines Künstlers” (Burchardt)
of the Saite ex. (above) and listed the hrgl. ms further on among #owers. But as
G. Maspero (1908, 176) rightly pointed out, the late model depicting the ms hrgl.
as a “combinaison de trois chacals ou renards” was “une des formes les plus anciennes du signe”,
which L. Borchardt (1907, 76) considered as the real form of the hrgl. “in allen
Zeiten” as attested from the OK (cf. e.g. Urk. I 11:16).
" 3. G. Maspero (1908, 176–7) af"liated it with a great variety of Eg.-Cpt. words, which are deriving from distinct roots.
nb1: Such as Eg. mss “cuirasse formée d’un cuir sur lequel les écailles de métal étaient
cousues” (q.v.), Cpt. (S) mous, (B) mouser “lorum, corium pour les sandales” (v.
s.v. Eg. mss), and even Eg. msq “peau” (q.v.).
nb2: The common origin of these forms is highly dubious: (1) Eg. mss “tunic” (NK,
FD 118) has been usually treated as a foreign word ( Janssen 1975, 260; Watson 1999,
789–790, §28; 2000, 570, §24; Lipi+ski 2001, 209; DUL 606 etc.). (2) The Cpt.
*ms 545



form has been explained as an “m-Bildung von srj Haar, Strähne” (NBÄ 322; KHW
520) contra Harris (Or. 30, 1961, 370). (3) Eg. msq (from NK) < OK msk3.
" 4. P. Lacau (1954, 45, §21; 1970, 64, fn. 2) derived it from a hypothetic Eg. *ms or *msj “fenek (petit renard)”.
nb: Unattested. To be distinguished from Eg. m3s (q.v.), which clearly represents a
separate root (with -3-).
" 5. W. Westendorf (1987, 461, fn. 16) explained it (via m- pre"x) from Eg. *w3s “heben, tragen, erhöhen” based on the most dubious comparanda like msj “gebären” < *“tragen, hervorbringen” (q.v.), m3s “ein Tier, dessen Fell”, Eg. m3s.t “Knie” (q.v., Wst.: orig. “Oberschenkel” < *“Schütze, Träger”), 3s.t “Sitz” ~ m3s.t “Sandbank” (q.v.). Uncritically adopting this, Ch. Leitz (2000, 275) too spoke of a “möglicher Zusammenhang” between the hrgl. ms, Eg. m3s.t “(in der Schurzlisten des A.R.)”, and m3s.(t) “Tier, wahrsch. Fuchs”. Unlikely.
nb: (1) Eg. *w3s “heben” is simply unattested. (2) Which animal hides behind Eg.
m3s is also uncertain: the specimen is highly debated and the rendering “fox” does
not "t all contexts (it went in teams in the NK, cf. Caminos 1956, 32). (3) The Ch.
cognates of Eg. m3s.t indicate that m- was part of the underlying AA (Ch.-Eg.) root
(*m-l-s). (4) Even the supposed cognacy of Eg. 3s.t (rdg. rather uncertain) vs. m3st
is ill-founded, since the reconstruction of 3- in the former is dubious and by far
not commonly accepted (cf., e.g., FD 206; DCT 431; ÄWb I 1033), moreover, it is
disproved also by the external data (cf. Vrg. 1945, 141, §16.b.13; Hodge 1968, 26,
§82; Takács 1999, 397), while (5) the latter word (m3s.t “shoal”) has been derived
from Eg. m3s.t “knee” (Caminos 1954, 129; GHWb 321).
" 6. GT: it cannot be excluded that the association of foxes’ skin to the archaic rituals around child-birth was only secondary (based on Wortspiel due to homophony?). In this case, cp. ES *ma"s- (?) “skin”
[GT], whose re#exes may perhaps be related with Eg. *ms.
nb1: Cf. Eth.-Sem.: Geez m3"s ~ m3«s “skin, hide, leather, headcover” [Lsl.], Tigre
ma"as “hide, skin” [LH 131] = mä"as “skin, leather” [Lsl.], Tna. ma"si “skin,
leather” [Lsl.], Gurage: Soddo & Aymellel mas & Zway m3s “tanned hide used to
lie down on” [Lsl.], Harari m3s “tanned hide” [Lsl.] !!! ECu.: Oromo m3si “tanned
hide” [Lsl.], Somali m?s “leather” [Abr. 1964, 176] = m3s-ka “leather” [Bell 1969,
174] (ES-Cu.: Lsl. 1963, 112; 1979, 426; 1988, 69).
nb2: The ECu. and Eth.-Sem. data may be due to various distinct mutual borrow
ings (e.g. Gurage from Oromo according to Leslau l.c.), while their ultimate origin
is unclear. The Sem. background of the ES root is obscure. (1) J. Barth (1893, 62)
af"liated it with Ar. m3«iz- “goat(skin)”, which W. Leslau (l.c.) rejected as “unlikely”.
(2) With regard to the distinction of -"- vs. -«- in Tigre, L. Kogan (2005, 192, §13)
has probably correctly denied the relationship of Geez m3"/«s etc. to ES: Tigre
mä«asä “to put hides into a mixture of acacia foliage for tanning” [LH 136] ~
LECu.: Saho ma«as- “gerben die Haut” [Rn. 1890, 257] = “to tan hide” [Lsl.],
which he linked rather with Ar. m32 “plonger, submerger qqn. dans l’eau” [BK II
1131] = “to steep, soak, macerate (a thing in water) and rub with the "ngers, mash
with the hand (medicine in water)” [Lane 2725] making (an obscure) hint on Ar.
ma"asa “frotter la peau” [BK II 1053] = “to rub leather vigorously” [Lsl.] vs. ma«asa
“frotter avec force le cuir” [BK II 1127] vs. ma«aša “frotter doucement” [BK II
1127]. Note that L. Reinisch (1890 l.c.) combined Saho ma«as- with a number of
impossible Eg. parallels (mr, md3, mt3j).
546 *ms



nb3: Eventually (at the PAA level), Sem. *ma/išk- “skin” [SED I 172, §190] may
be also related on a biconsonantal basis as surmised already by L. Bender (1975,
185, §72.1), who combined Geez ma"is and Akk. mašk- “skin” with CCh.: Margi
Öm'ì “skin (of man)” [Hfm. apud RK 1973, 101 & JI] = ínšì" [IL/JI 1994 II, 296].
The origin of the Margi word has been disputed. JI (1994 I, 153) saw in it a met.
of Ch. *z-m, but Margi -'- < Ch. *-z/„- is unlikely.
nb4: There are many other forms that seem to be prima vista similar, but their
cognacy is either unlikely or certainly to be ruled out. (1) Bed. míswa (f ) “Ledersack,
Schlauch” [Rn. 1895, 174] = miswá* (m) “leather bag made of whole skin esp.
of ox” [Rpr. 1928, 219] = mis$wud “leather sack made of more than one skin”
[Hds. 1996 MS, 96]: apparently an m- pre"x form with a C3 -*, which excludes a
connection with ES *m"s. (2) Yaaku misa", pl. mih-nin [mih- < *mis-] “rope, made
of skin” [Heine 1975, 132]: cf. rather ECu. *ma/is- “cord” [Ehret 1991, 218] =
*maš- [Sasse 1976]. (3) SCu.: Irq. mâyšot, pl. mâyšu “cow skin sack” [Wtl. 1953] =
mašõt (f ) “big leather bag for use on donkey”, mayšõt (f ) “leather bag” [MQK 2002,
71–72] was borrowed from Datooga. (4) Akk. maz3"u “ein Ledergegenstand” [AHW
637] = “a leather object” [CAD m1, 438]. (5) NOm.: Kaffa naš-o “cuoio” [Cecchi
apud Rn. 1888, 325] = n3š. “pelle tannata” [Crl. 1951, 481] was combined by H. C.
Fleming (1964, 46) rather with LECu.: Baiso neKi “bark of tree”. (6) Whether SBrb.
*)m-z-h1 [Prasse] = *ta-mz5-t “leather bag” [Mlt.]: Ahaggar ta-mhi-t, pl. ti-mh5-t-5n
“sac en peau de dimension moyenne (formée d’une seule peau tannée de chèvre,
mouton, jeune mou#on etc.)” [Fcd. 1951–2, 1173] = “middle-size bag made of a
whole goat or sheepskin” [Mlt.], Tadghaq & Nslm. ta-mši-t “leather bag (sac en
peau)” [Bst. quoted by Prs. and Mlt.], Tadghaq & Tudalt ta-mši-t “sack (millet was
stored and transported in leather sacks until recently)” [Sudlow 2001, 293] (SBrb.:
Prs. 1969, 79, §515) !! Guanche: Lanzarote & Fuertaventura maho “Fellschuh” [Wlf.
1955] = “calzado”, maho-s (-s Spanish pl. ending!) “calzados de los cueros de las
cabras, el pelo afuera, unos como zapatos” [Wlf. 1965] = “a shoe” [Mlt.] etc. (Brb.:
Wlf. 1955, 100, §11; Mlt. 1988, 197, #3.2.2.5, fn. 8) are related is rather uncertain.
A.Ju. Militarev (l.c.) explained Tuareg *ta-mz5-t from *ta-m-azay-t derived from *a
zayha “leather thing”, while D. J. Wölfel (l.c.) identi"ed the underlying verbal with
Hgr. ah “écorcher de sa peau” [Fcd.].
ms “enklitische Konjunktion: doch o.ä.” (MK Lit., Wb II 142, 4; GHWb 359) = “surely, indeed” (EG 1957, §251; FD 117).
nb: Cf. var. mjs in CT III 232b (M.C. 105) and VI 240r (T1Ca) “surely” (DCT
161).
! GT: cp. perhaps CCh.: Hide (Htk., Lmg.) ma'a [-'- < *-s/š-?] “certain, sûr” [Egc. 1971, 216] | (?) Musgu massi “aufrichtig” [Rohlfs apud Lks. 1941, 66]?
nb: It would be tempting to compare also Akk. (YBab.) amašša “sicherlich” [AHW
42: “Ableitung unklar”, cf. GAG §113.c & §121.d], but the rdg. of this particle has
been corrected in CAD for abarša “truly, surely (?)”.
ms “als Zins eingegangenes Getreide (neben: Korn der eigenen Ernte)” (XIX., Wb II 142, 2) = “Zins (auch als Getreide eingegangen)” (GHWb 362) (?) > Dem. ms.t (masc.!) “Zinsen” (DG 178) ~ ms “interest” (Ostr. Toronto D 55:3 etc., Caminos) ~ ms “to bear interest (intr.)” (Hermupolis Legal Code 4:23, 5:6, Mattha 1975, 136) = “porter intérêt” (Vcl.) > Cpt. (SAM) mhse, (B) mhsi, (F) mhsh
ms 547



(f ) “usury, interest” (CD 186a) = “Zinsen, Wucher” (KHW 101) = “intérêts d’un prêt” (DELC 122).
nb1: The etymon of Cpt. (S) Temhse “to give at an interest” has been identi"ed
by R. Caminos (1954 LEM, 238) with Eg. dj r msj “to give at an interest” (Pap.
Anastasi V, rt. 11:3).
nb2: Vocalized as *músy.at > *m†s.at (Vrg. 1973 Ib, 139) = old *m°s.w't > later
*m°s.j't > *mÉs.'t (NBÄ).
nb3: W. Helck (MWNR 576) found the alternative rendering “Korn” of ms in
certain contexts “schwer abzusetzen, da die vom Wb vorgenommene Erklärung als Zinskorn
wegen mhse sich wenigstens aus unserer Stelle . . . nicht ergibt”. This doubt, accompanied
by the shift of gender (not discussed in CED, NBÄ, KHW, and DELC), somewhat
queries the equation of the Wb gloss with msj “interest” (Pap. Anastasi V, rt. 11:3)
> Dem.-Cpt.
! Ultimately originates in Eg. msj “to give birth” > “to produce etc.” as usually proposed in the lit. Its literal or primary sense might have actually been “offspring of money” (CD 186a; Vrg. 1973 Ib, 139) = “Geburt, Nachkommenschaft” (NBÄ) = “Vermehrung (des Geldes)” (KHW). Semantically plausible, cf. Gk. %'$97 “interest” (rendered in Dem. just by ms/ms.t) < %1$%6.
lit.: Vrg. 1950, 291; Vrg. 1973 Ib, 139; NBÄ 471; CED 90; KHW 101; DELC
122; Quack 1994, 101, fn. 53 etc.
nb1: Its derivation directly from Dem. ms “Kind” (SAK 19, 1992, 9; WD III 56)
is rather doubtful.
nb2: In the light of the inner Eg. etymology, other suggestions are out of question.
(1) GT: this must apply to the prima vista tempting af"liation of Eg. ms with Hbr.
mas “Frondienst” [GB 439], Off. Aram. ms “forced labour, corvée”, mss “to pay
tax (?)” [Dupont-Sommer, DNWSI 662–3, 665] = ms “tax (?)” [Segal] !!! LECu.:
PBoni *m3s (f ) “debt” [Heine 1982, 101] > Boni m3s (f ) “Schuld” [Heine 1977,
292] !!! NOm.: Kaffa meš-. “debito” [Crl. 1951, 476]. (2) Comparing Eg. ms( j)
with CCh.: Logone msoaa “millet” (OS 1992, 184; HSED #1817) is evidently false.
(3) Similarly, the combination with the Ch. re#exes of AA *m-[ç] “to trade” [GT]
(Takács 1998, 157, #17) is also incorrect.
ms “Ehrfurcht bezeugen vor (n) . . .”, also: ms t3 n (XXII., Wb II 142, 7–8).
nb1: D. Meeks (kind p.c., 13 April 2000) views that “il n’est pas sûr que ‘to be afraid’
soit sémantiquement satisfaisant” and surmises rather a connection to 3ms-jb (var. jms-jb,
also ms-jb) “Verbum, von der Freude der Kuh am saugenden Kälbchen” (MK, Wb
I 11, 7) = “se réjouir, montrer l’intérêt pour” (AL 77.0054). But its supposed very
late occurence (ms n %r[ j=f (?)] “[seinem (?)] Vorgesetzten Ehrfurcht bezeugen”)
in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD, Osing 1998, 213, 214, n. af & fn. 1042
with further evidence) speaks for a separate gloss ms as in Wb.
nb: Related to mss “schlottern (vor Angst)” (XVIII., Wb, below)?
! Its meaning and the underlying root are uncertain. GT: if the sense suggested in Wb is correct, it might be af"liated with LECu.: SA *mays- “to fear” [GT] (with a possible Hbr. re#ex).

nb2: The origin of Hbr. msy hi"l “in große Furcht setzen” [GB 439] is uncertain.
Perhaps just a "g. sense of Hbr. msy hi"l “1. to cause to melt, 2. cause to disappear

nb3: The etymology of Akk. m1su II (pl.tantum) “Kulte” [AHW 647: u.H.] = m1s$
~ m3s$ “cultic rites, rituals” [CAD m2, 35] is obscure. In principle, the semantic

nb1: M. Kossmann (1999, 17) views that LEg. ms “n’est pas non plus preuve de l’appartenance
à la branche berbère: des termes comme ‘roi’ ou ‘chef ’ sont facilement empruntés”.
NB2: The "liative element *mas “lord (AB1:3")” [Mlt.] occurs in several Brb. personal
names (like Amastan, Massinissa, Masuna, Masgivin, Massulet, Mastigas, Mastiman
etc.), cf. Bates 1914, 80; Mlt. 1991,151.
nb3: The Brb. word seems to stem from the common AA heritage being cognate
with NOm.: Chara m1s3 (subst.) “grande” [Crl. 1938 III, 172] !!! Ch. *m-S “chief ”
[GT]: WCh.: Hausa mààsúú (pl. of mà5) “(s)he who owns, chief ” [Abr. 1962, 637] =
“maître de, propriétaire de” [Gouffé 1974, 369] !! CCh.: BM *m-G [secondary *G
< *s] “master” [Hfm. 1987, 459] > Margi mGa ~ mG! “chief, king” [Mkr.], Margi
Putai mGa ~ mGä “chief ” [Hfm. 1987, 471, §21] | PHigi *maz- “chief, king” [GT]:
Fali-Gili maz, Kapsiki maze, Higi-Bana maz-ca (Higi gr.: Mkr. after Krf.) | Mboku
masay “Oberhaupt” [Lks.], Mofu masay “Oberhaupt” [Lks.] = m\âsây “chef de
famille” [Mch. 1953, 178] (CCh.: Lks. 1973, table between pp. 248–9).
nb4: With regard to its pl. mààsúú, C. Gouffé (1974, 369) declined (“semble devoir
être écarté”) the traditional derivation of Hausa mà5 (sg.) from Kanuri má_y “king”
(Pls. 1958, 79, fn. 17).
nb5: The equation of CCh. *m-S [GT] with ECh.: Mokilko mózìgù “chief, king”
[Mkr.] = mózìgò “chef (roi)” [ Jng. 1990, 142] (suggested by H. G. Mukarovsky
1987, 124) is dubious. For the problem cf. Eg. mšwš (q.v.).
nb6: No convincing Sem. cognates. The etymology of PSinaitic m2 “lord” [Alb.]
= m2 “Herr” [Donner] = mš (sic) “don” [Loundine] is uncertain. W. F. Albright
(1966, 41–42) combined it with a certain Ug. m2 “lord” vs. m2-t “lady”, which are
ms 549



rendered recently rather as “infant, baby boy (title of Baal’s son)” vs. “damsel,
young lady (royal title in epic, chief wife of Keret and Danel)” [DUL 604, 606].
In addition, Albright assumed PSin. m2 to have “clipped by dissimilation” from Sem.
*m2l “to be like (to), represent” [Alb.], cf. Hbr. mšl qal “herrschen, Herr sein”
[GB 470] = “representieren, herrschen” [Donner], Off. Aram. mšl “-&)'*-!-)*.,
3+0*. -&)'*.” [SAN IV 204]. H. Donner (1967, 279), in turn, af"liated the PSin.
form with Eg. ms, Sum. mes, Ar. mayyi2- (sic, no details). The view of A. van den
Branden (quoted by Loundine 1991, 111) that the PSin. word was borrowed into
(!) Eg. (as ms!), is unacceptable.
nb7: There can be no connection to OAss. massu"um, OAkk. & OBab. massûm
“Anführer” [AHW 619] < Sum. maš.zu (cf. Watson 1996, 708) either.
nb8: Eventually, the ES-Ch. isogloss represented e.g. by Common Gurage m2s
“male” [Lsl.] !!! Ch. *m-S “husband, male” [GT] might be related. Note that
W. Leslau (1987, 83) rejected the usual comparison of the Grg. root with Ar. ba"usa
“to be strong, intrepid”, Geez b2"2si “man, male” (Praetorius 1879, 50).
ms3.w (?) “der Onanierer” (PT 1248, ÜKAPT V 148) = “who masturbated” (AEPT 198, n. 2). ! Rdg. and etymology disputed. Discussed s.v. Eg. jws3.w.
ms3q.t, in: ms3q.t-jb “als Beiname der Sachmet” (XVIII., Wb II 142, 10) = “(Epit. der Sachmet)” (GHWb 363).
nb: Act. “the self-possessed one”?
! Perhaps a participial m- pre"x form derived from Eg. s3q “zusammenfügen, zusammenraffen” (PT, Wb IV 25–26), cp. esp. s3q-jb “sich selbst beherrschend” (MK, Wb IV 26, 1–2).
nb: The etymology of Eg. s3q is debated: (1) A. Ember (1930, #3.c.30) incorrectly
equated Eg. s3q with Ar. salaka “to march along, wind off (thread)”. Impossible
both phonologically (Eg. -q & Ar. -k) and semantically. (2) E. Zyhlarz (1934, 118)
identi"ed it with SBrb.: Tuareg á-s23 “verbinden”. (3) M. Cohen (1947, 139, §283)
and G. Conti (1978, 28, fn. 1) af"liated it with Akk. s/šaqqu “Sack, Traergewand”
[AHW 1027] !! Hbr. Gaq “sack” [KB 1349–50] and the Agaw re#exes of AA *s-=
“to weave” [GT]. Unlikely. Eg. -3- vs. Sem. *-Ø- is problematic. (4) C.T. Hodge
(1966, 46, #56) combined Eg. s3q with WCh.: Hausa sár=à “to interlace, -wine,
-weave”, sár=èè “1. to become tangled, interlaced, interwined, interwoven, 2. pull
the door to and fasten the chain on it, fasten its hasp on its staple” [Brg. 1934, 908].
Possible both phonologically and semantically. (5) V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED
#380) assumed Eg. s3q < *slq ~ Ar. slq “to gather” [OS! not listed in BK] !!! CCh.:
Matakam (Mafa) cakal & Mofu 'akal “to gather, collect” [OS].
ms3&.tj (PT) > ms3d.tj ~ msd3.tj (CT) > msd.tj (MK-GR) (dual) “die Nasenmuscheln, auch die Nasenlöcher (durch die man riecht)” (Med., Wb II 153, 5–6; Grapow 1954, 37; GHWb 363, 366; WD II 67: cf. RdE 26, 1974, 144) = “Nasenlöcher oder Nasen#ügel” (Edel 1954, 88–89) = “les fosses nasales” (Lefébvre 1952, 19) = “two nostrils” (Breasted 1930, 242, 536; FD 117; PL 468; DCT 182) = “nasal cavities” (Ward 1972, 19) = “narines” (AL 79.1367) = “pair of nose-wings” (DLE I 244) = “sides of the nose, nostrils” (Walker 1996, 270).
550 ms3.w – ms3!.tj



nb1: For the PT evidence of the oldest form (ms33.tj) see Edel 1954, 88–89, §4;
1955, 110, §256; Roquet 1984, 372. The ex. in CT II 36a (msd3.tj < ms3d.tj <
ms33.tj) displays a metathesis and the regular shift of OK -3- > -d-.
nb2: Although no vocalized form is known, its syllabic structure was reconstructed
by G. Fecht (1960, 180, §373) as *m's]03't'j > *m's3]'3t'j.
! E. Edel (1954, 88–89, §4; 1955, 110, §256), followed by G. Fecht (1960, 180, §373), W. A. Ward (1972, 19), and P. Wilson (PL 468), saw in it an m- pre"x nomen instr. derived from Eg. s33 “frisch machen” (PT 565c), which is the caus. (*s-w33) of w33 “grün, frisch sein”. Henceforth, the proper meaning of ms33.t has been rendered as *“Frischmacher” (Edel) = *“die beiden frisch Erhaltenden” (Fecht) = *“those which make fresh” (Wilson). ! Other etymologies (mostly ignoring PT ms33.t) cannot be accepted: " 1. P. Lacau (1970, 50), although he accepted PT ms33.t “narine”, considered its source (*s33) only as hypothetic and unknown (!). Instead, he assumed an etymological connection to Eg. ms3j “to hate” (below) on the analogy of Eg. fn3 “nose” > fn3 “zürnen”. Rightly rejected by W. A. Ward (1972, 19). " 2. H. Smith (1979, 163) explained it from Eg. s3 “to break, open”, since the “embalmers ‘broke’ into the body through the nostrils”. False. Rejected by D. Meeks (AL 79.1367) " 3. The Russian linguists erroneously analyzed Med. msd.t as nomen instr. of an unattested Eg. *sd ultimately derived from PAA *'V9 “to smell” [Mlt.].
lit.: MM 1983, 218 (Ar.-Eg.); Djk. et al. 1986, 34 (Ar.-Brg.-Eg.-Angas); Mlt.-Stl.
1990, 56 (Sem.-Angas-Eg.); Djk. 1992, 17 (Ar.-Brg.-Eg.-AS).
nb: Based on Ar. 2"9 “sentir mauvais” [BK I 215] = “to have a bad smell” [Mlt.] !!!
NOm.: *ši*/9- “nose” [GT] !! SOm.: Ari dial. s$di “nose” [Flm.] (Om.: CR 1913,
407; Dlg. 1973, 110; Flm. 1974, 90, #18) !!! WCh.: Bade "Ü-st-án “nose” [Lukas 1968,
223] and some other forms that are certainly unrelated. Thus, e.g., SCu.: Burunge
'u"-ud “to smell” derives from SCu. *cu"- [*ts-] “to smell (intr.)” [GT after Ehret
1980, 199–200], while the quotation of WCh.: Angas 'et, Sura '+t “to smell” (sic)
is due to a mere translation error of O. Stolbova who misunderstood “to smelt”,
the correct mng. of Angas 'et (cf. Flk. 1915, 157). In addition, H. C. Fleming
(1974, 90) and A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 110) analyzed of the Om. data as *sin-tV.
" 4. A. M. Lam (1993, 379) linked it to Ful 'er*i “fosses nasales”. Absurd.

nb3: The name of Moses has been usually derived from Eg. msj (either from its
pseudopart. 3rd p.m.sg. or from Eg. ms “child”), which is due to K. R. Lepsius
(followed by F. J. Lauth and G. M. Ebers and many others listed by Gardiner 1936,
192 and Vergote 1980, 89f.), see also Spg., ZDMG 53, 1899, 633f.; Grd. 1911,

Grif"ths 1953, 228 (with further lit.); KB 642. This etymology is hindered in the
view of J. Vergote (1980, l.c.) by two anomalies: (1) the vowel of the 1st syllable
was in short Eg. but long in Hbr. (explained by J.W. Grif"ths l.c. with the in#uence
of Gk. D6?B7 ~ D6#?B7), while (2) Eg. -s- vs. Hbr. -š- also differ. Other etymolo
gies for the Hbr. PN have also been proposed: Grif"th ZÄS 46, 1907, 132–4 (Eg.);
Haupt OLZ 12, 1909, 164 (Hbr.); Grd. 1936, 194 (Hbr.); ,erný 1941, 349–353

cognate (!) even in Akk. m3šu ~ maššu ~ mašû “twin” [CAD m1, 401], which,
however, is treated in AHW 631 as a borrowing from Sum. máš.
nb2: For an Ug. var. mš-t (PN) cf. Watson 2003, 246. Ug. m2 has been traditionally
equated with Ar. mayyi2- “mou, tendre” [BK II 1170] = “soft, gentle” [Gordon], which
was rightly rejected by J. Aistleitner (WUS #1717) and C. H. Gordon (1955, 293,
#1185), while both of them supposed in Ug. m2 a foreign word borrowed from Eg. ms.
nb3: The Ar. parallels (if any) are doubtful, cf. msw: mas3 “1. introduire la main
dans le vagin de la chamelle pour en tirer le sperme de l’étalon qui vient de la
couvrir, quant on ne peut pas qu’elle retienne de ce mâle” [BK II 1107] and msy
“to cleans the uterus of camel (an action performed by inserting the hand in the
animal’s uterus and drawing out the offending matter)” [Guillaume] = “to clear
the uterus of a camel from sperm, wipe with the hand” [Ehr.], although both were
derived by Ch. Ehret (1989, 182, §54) from Ar. bicons. *ms- “to touch”, while Guil
laume (1965 II, 23) maintains a basic sense “to draw” and cognacy with Hbr. mšy
“to draw”. Moreover, Ar. -s- + Sem. *-2-. The same applies to the C2 of Ar. mašy:
maš3 “avoir beaucoup d’enfants ou de petits (se dit des femmes ou des femelles)”,
VIII “avoir une nombreuse postérité” [BK II 1113], massa I “cohabiter” [Fagnan
1923, 163], and nu/a/is"- “enceinte d’un enfant” [Dozy II 664]. In the latter case,
in addition, we should assume an interchange m- ~ n-. For the reasons mentioned
above, neither of these comparanda suits fully.
nb4: The Eth.-Sem. parallels are equally uncertain: (1) Harari m$s “to be preg
nant” is out of question, cf. ES *)«ms: Tigre «amsä(t) “to be pregnant” [Lsl. 1963,
112]. (2) The origin of ES: Gafat mossay “young child (enfant)” [Lsl.] = mosiet
“infant, child” [Beke apud Lsl.], Amh. mossa “young child” [Lsl.], Gurage: Chaha
& Gyeto mwäsa & Muher & Gogot mwässa & Soddo (Aymellel) mossa etc. “veau”
[Lsl.] (Eth.-Sem.: Lsl. 1956, 217; 1979, 425) is disputed. F. Praetorius (1879, 73)
equated the Gafat word with Argobba mans explained from *män"2s < )n"s “to
be little”, while W. Leslau (l.c.) maintained the cognacy of all these ES data, which
A. Faber (1984, 200, §1) derived from Sem. *"nS1 “weak, small”. For the pattern
of Gafat mosiet < *)msy cf. Gafat m2siet “evening, night” ~ Eg. msw.t. (3) A.Ju.
Militarev (2006, 36, §51.10) compared Ug. m2 and the related AA words also with
ES: Grg.: Soddo m2ss “man”, Arg. mis & Harari miš “fellow”, which can hardly
belong here (cf. Eg. mš«).
nb5: L. Reinisch (1873, 19, fn. 2) combined Eg. ms with a certain Brb. i-mis (sic)
“Kind, Sohn”, while A.Ju. Zavadovskij (1967, 22) equated Eg. ms “child” with a
certain Brb. ma„u„i (sic, -„-) “(0*0"%;” [Zvd.]. Both comparanda are obscure.
554 msj



nb6: V. Bla&ek (2002, 118, §8.6) explained NBrb. *m2mmi “"ls” as a compund of
Brb. *)m-s “être originaire de” + *)m “mother”. Unlikely, cf. Takács 1996, 127.
nb7: Ch. Ehret (1991, 235) reconstructed ECu. *mi/u/a'(')- “to stick out, emerge out
of ” based on the comparison of Had. miš- (above) with HECu.: Burji mus-3 or m$s-3,
var. míss-a “penis” [Sasse 1982, 145, 150] = mis-a ~ miss-a ~ mus-3 [Hds. 1989, 213].
nb8: LECu.: Som. mi«ís, pl. mí«ísó “newborn animal” [Abr. 1964, 180] seems also
unrelated because of the -«- unre#ected in Eg. msj.
nb9: Ch. Ehret (1995, #59) combined Eg. ms etc. also with LECu.: Afar mf-ta,
pl. m.y “kid (male baby goat)” [PH 1985, 170] erroneously equating Afar -y <
*-c (!) with Eg. -s-.
nb10: ECu.: Yaaku -!mus- [tr.] “to have sexual intercourse” [Heine 1975, 128] !! SCu.:
Dhl. "muš- “to give birth”, "umuš-ikuó- “to be born” [Eld. 1973 MS, 2, §79–80] =
"umuš- “to give birth”, "umuš-iku3- “to be born” [Ehret 1980, 295] are also unre
lated. V. Bla&ek & M. Tosco (1994 MS, 4) traeted the Yaaku verb as originally caus.
*-!m-us- compared with LECu.: Dasenech (Geleba) "um-u [Tosco] = úmm-o [Hhn.
1966, 96], Arbore umm-ó (pl.) “children” [Tosco] < ECu. *"$m- “to create” [Tosco].
Ch. Ehret (1980, 295) seems to decline the analysis of Dahalo -uš- as a caus. ending.
nb11: W. Leslau (1959, l.c.) explained the Mocha ex. as a loan from Orm. muæ3
“child” [Gragg 1982, 292], which cannot belong here (Orm. æ + Eg. s).
nb12: SCu.: Asa msumbe-tog, pl. msumbe “son (in address)”, Iraqw masómbá"-îma
“a youth” (SCu.: Flm. 1969, 10) are probably also to be left out of consideration.
nb13: D. Barreteau & H. Jungraithmayr (1990, 151) derived Mwulyen )mw-š from
their Ch. *mbw-(s), which is baseless. Ch. *)mw-s-y seems more likely (above).
nb14: J. Greenberg (1965, 91, #15), V. Bla&ek (1989, 216–217), and M. Bechhaus
Gerst (1998, 121) erroneously compared Eg. msj with forms preserving an original
AA *b-s [GT], which must be a distinct root, cf. NAgaw: Qemant b3s “engendrer,
devenir père” [CR 1912, 181] !! LECu.: Saho & Afar bus “matrice” [Crl.] !!! NOm.:
Kaffa buš-. “son, boy” [Lsl. 1951, 416], Mocha buš(o) “child, son” [Lsl. 1959, 23],
Shinasha (Bworo) buš. “son” [Lsl. 1956, 191] etc. This comparison was elaborated
in the framework of J.H. Greenberg’s (1958; 1965) theory on the special AA proto
phoneme *mb-, which was rightly rejected by V. M. Illi'-Svity' (1966).
nb15: Similarly unconvincing is the remark on ECh.: Dng. mw-s by JI (1994 I 77)
that it “resembles” Tubu bus “gebären”.
nb16: Because of the anomalous sibilant of ECh. *mi'- “child” [Mlt.] (above), ECh.:
Kera & Tupuri mesew & Kwang míséw “adultère de la femme” [Ebert 1977 MS,
7] = Kera m1s1w & Tupuri mësëw “adultère de femme” [Ruelland 1978, 167]
cannot be related.
nb17: Is perhaps AA *m-s (?) “seed” [GT] > SBrb.: EWlm. --7asa, pl. i-7asa-n “1.
semence, 2. origine” [PAM 2003, 557] !! SOm.: Ari m#àša & Hamer maš- & Dime
mišs,t “seed” [Bnd. 1994, 157] eventually related?
! Other etymologies are false.
nb: (1) G. von der Gabelentz (1894, 161) equated a certain Eg. mese, wese (sic)
with NBrb.: Qbl. a-bbuš and Bsq. pitcho “Penis”. (2) O. Bates (1914, 81) and
M. Bechhaus-Gerst (1998, 121) combined it with WBrb.: Zng. a-mo&& “accoucher,
mettre bas”, mo&&ei “enfants”, t-mu&&eg “accoucher”, ta-mu&&eg “accouchement”
[Bst. 1909, 243] = a-ma& “to bear, give birth to”, me‰i‰ “to be alive” [Bates] =
o-mu‰‰ih “enfanter, accoucher” [Ncl. 1953, 220], which is excluded (Zng. ‰ < Brb.
*l). (3) O. Bates (l.c.) extended this erroneous comparison to OBrb. mes- “"liative
pre"x” (for which cf. also Eg. ms above). Hmb. 1930, 284: ~ Ful mah-de “façonner”
and (!) Hes-do “femme qui vient d’enfanter” [Hmb.] = Hes-*o vs. H.sa “petit d’un
chat ou d’un chien” [Lam]. The latter comparison was suggested also by A. M. Lam
(1993, 413). Absurd. (4) L. Homburger (1929, 166): ~ Bantu byala (sic). (5) Z. S.
Harris (1936, 122), in turn, combined Eg. ms with Ph. mš “statue” and Sem. *nG".
(6) W. Westendorf (1987, 460–1 & fn. 16–17) assumed a primary root *m3s (unattested),
which he explained ultimately from a hypothetic Eg. *w3s “tragen, heben, erhöhen”,
msj 555



whence he derived (with m- pre"x) also Eg. m3s.t “Knie, Oberschenkel” (act. “Stütze,
Träger”), m3s Tier dessen Fell”, *ms “Fuchsfelle”. He made even a hint on IE *Xenu
/*Xneu- “Knie” vs. IE *Xen(H)- ~ *Xn1/.- “erzeugen” [IEW 373, 381], which
as he rightly remarked – “zur Vorsicht bei etymologischen Vergleichen gemahnt”.
msj.t “Art Wasservögel” (MK, Wb II 143, 3; cf. also Helck MWNR 505, 1199) = “eine Sorte eßbaren Ge#ügels, wohl irgendeine Gänseart” (Erman 1896, 53) = “an edible bird, presumably aquatic” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 348) = “waterfowl” (FD 117) = “Wasservogel” (Barta 1969, 16, 139) = “gibier de l’eau” (AL 78.1848) = “marsh bird, breeding fowl: geese (?)” (DLE I 241) = “Ge#ügel (coll.), *Hühner” (GHWb 362) = “type of waterbird, an edible waterfowl” (PL 461).
nb: R. Caminos (LEM 343) supposed in msr.t-bird of Pap. Sallier IV vs. 2:4 (cf.
DLE I 242) either a defective wrg. of msj.t or a haplographic compound *ms-sr.t
“young/offspring of the sr.t-goose”.
! Etymology uncertain. Most likely seem solutions #1 and #2. " 1. D. Meeks (AL l.c.) found “dif!cult to distinguish” it from OK mz.t ~ mz3.t (q.v.). " 2. G. Takács (1996, 45, #6): cognate with CCh.: PKotoko *m3[c]V “goose” [GT]: Logone mmáás2 [Lks.] ~ máási [Nct.] “größere Art von Wasserente, Gans” [Lks. 1936, 110] = mmás2 [Prh.] = (?) maši “oie de Gambie: Plectropterus gambensis” [Lbf. 1976, 24, #2], Affade mátsi “a fowl” [Barth] = mâtzi [ma:tsi/m3ci] “Gans” [Seetzen], Ngala m-see “a fowl” [Barth], Makari maasa “a fowl” [Barth], cf. Mara mà:sÜ “canard de la brousse” [Bouny 1977, 72] (Kotoko: Slk. 1967, 226, §188; Prh. 1972, 11, #1.4; 65, #40.1).
nb1: Takács (l.c.) connected the Eg.-Kotoko isogloss to doubtful Brb. parallels, for
which cf. perhaps Eg. mš« (below).
nb2: The Eg.-Kotoko etymology does not necessarily exclude the identi"cation with
old Eg. mz.t, cf. the rare (irregular?) correspondence of Eg. z vs. AA *c (EDE I

" 3. Ch. Ehret (1995, 302, #574) derived it from AA *-m3'- “to immerse, #ow over” based on false comparanda (below). Absurd.
nb: Ehret’s Sem. *m2- “to leak, run out”, Som. m3š- “to spread over (rain, #ood,

*-pr- > *-3r- (*m's]'p'r.'t > *m's]'pr.'t > *m's]'3r.'t) which he compared with that seen
in Amarna cuneiform (14th cent.) -0u"ru- < Eg. 0pr.w (KMAV 14, 58, 89; Ranke,
ZÄS 56, 1920, 74, fn. 3; Edel 1948, 14f.). The question is whether this change can
be projected to the MK.
! G. Fecht (1960 l.c.) explained it as the m- pre"x form of Eg. spr “Rippe”, which seems to be commonly accepted (Wb l.c., Jones l.c., GHWb l.c.).
mspr.t “Zu#uchtsort (für Schiffe)” (MK, Wb II 144, 7) = “Ankunft” (Amduat, Hornung 1963 II, 15, n. 36; Meeks 1994, 258) = “haven, landing-place” (Petrie 1900, 48; Fischer 1968, 140; cf. Jones 1988, 206, §10) = “der Ankunftsort” (Edfu, Budde & Kurth 1994, 13, §55).
nb: Jones (1988, 169, §74) rendered some of its exx. as mspr.t “ribs (?)” (q.v.).
! Nomen loci of Eg. spr “kommen zu, gelangen nach, erreichen” (PT, Wb IV 102–3), lit. “a place which enables arrival” ( Jones).
lit.: Grapow 1914, 28; Hornung 1963 II, 15, n. 36; Jones 1988, 206, §10.
nb1: H. Grapow (l.c.) and H. Smith (1979, 161) mentioned further possible m- deriva
tives of the same root, e.g., mspr “Name des dritten und sechzehnten (mspr sn-nw)
Tages des Mondmonats” (GR, Wb II 144, 3; Grapow), msprj.t “name of the 6th
hour of the night and its goddess” (Smith), mspr “ein Heiligtum” (GR, Wb II 144,
6), mspr.tj.w “Art Arbeiter oder Handwerker” (GR, Wb II 144, 6), which, however,
should be subject to further study. Cf. also OK mspr “? (in einem Dorfnamen)” (Wb
II 144, 5; GHWb 363), mspr (CT IV 8, AECT I 205, spell 270, n. 3 with a hint
on Wb II 144, 5–6), and the equally enigmatic mspr in CT VI 286 (AECT II 234,
spell 660, n. 50: “of the three mspr words of Wb II 144, 3–6, none !t here”).

nb2: The etymology of Eg. spr is not evident: (1) Usually identi"ed with Sem.:
Akk. špr “to send” [CAD š1, 430] !! Ar. safara I “11. se mettre en route”, II “2.
envoyer, expédier”, safr- “voyageur” [BK I 1098] !! Geez safara “to camp” [Lsl.
1987, 489] !! Jibbali sfÆr “to travel” [ Jns. 1981, 224], Soqotri sfor “voyager” [Lsl.
1938, 289]. For Sem.-Eg.: Hommel 1883, 440, fn. 30; Alb. 1927, #74; MM 1983,
226; Castellino 1984, 16. The Sem.-Eg. parallel was equated in SISAJa III, 8, 38
i.a. also with CCh.: Fali-Gili suvùrì “ausgehen” [Krf.] and falsely even with WCh.:
Ngizim sàafÖr “3. bringing water from a long distance” [Schuh 1981, 142], which
is but an Ar. loan via Kanuri. (2) Albright 1918, 244, #91; Ember 1926, 311, #9.2;
1930, #8.a.6; Vrg. 1945, 142, #16.c.2; Conti 1978, 27: Eg. spr ~ Sem.: JAram.
s2par “(an der) Grenze (gelegener Ort)” [Levy 1924 III 574] | Ar. šafara “arriver
au bord, à l’extrémité de qqch., ef#eurer”, šafr- “bord, extrémité, crête (de toute
chose), lisière d’une vallée” [BK I 1247]. Although this comparison is hindered by
the irregular Eg. s- vs. Ar. š- (for which, however, cf. Eg. sp.t ~ Sem. *Gap-at- “lip”),
it is semantically justi"able, cf. Fr. arriver < Lat. ad “to” + r5pa “river-bank”, Akk.
kiš3du “Ufer” < kaš3du “erreichen”.
msm.w (pl.) “eine Landbezeichnung (neben Städten und Gauen)” (PT 993b hapax, Wb II 144, 9; GHWb 363; ÄWb I 564) = “Gaue (?)” (ÜKAPT VI 134) = “(lands, mng. unknown)” (AEPT 168, utt. 480, n. 2). ! Mng. and etymology obscure. GT: only guesses can be made.
nb1: Cf. perhaps either (1) ES: Geez mas« “rural area” [Lsl. 1987, 362: no Sem.

[Lsl. 1959, 42] (3) or WCh.: Bokkos màšwà “Stadt” [ Jng. 1970, 144].
nb2: Any connection to EBrb.: Nfs. ta-mésna “fuori” [Prd.] !! Gdm. ta-mésna
“deserto” [Prd.] = ta-ma/esna, pl. ti-masni-w5$n “le désert (hors de l’oasis)” [Lanfry

msn.w “Harpunierer (besonders von Nilpferden), Harpunenjäger” (CT, Wb II 145, 4; Sethe 1922, 137–8; FÄW 199: archaic period) = “harpooner (of hippopotamus)” (EG 1927, 510, V32; AEO II 90*, §190A; FD 117) = “ceux qui participent à la chasse à l’hippopotame” (Vernus, LÄ IV 108).
nb: K. Sethe (ZÄS 54, 1918, 50f.) correctly rejected deriving Cpt. (SB) besnht
“Schmied” (KHW 28) from Eg. msn.w (cf. Spg. 1919–20, 42–43, §33, fn. 8).
! From the same (?) root: (1) Perhaps msn “Name des Schriftzeichens: der korbförmige Schwimmer an der Harpunenleine” (LP, Wb II 145, 1) = “wickerwork frail (possibly also used as a #oat by hippopotamus-hunters)” (EG 1927, 510, V32) = “name of the sign representing a reed basket for transport of dates” (CED 91) = “une bourriche tressée, et, sans doute, le #otteur attaché à la corde du harpon” (Vernus, LÄ IV 108–9, fn. 1) = “a woven basket and also the #oat attached to the harpoon” (PL
msm.w 565



462) > (?) Cpt. (S) mosN, mosne (m) “Korb, Gefäß” (Spg. KHW 65; Wst. KHW 102) = “a vessel or dry measure” (CD 186b; CED 91) = “nom d’un récipient” (DELC 122).
nb: As A. H. Gardiner (EG l.c., n. 3) confessed, the alleged connection of the sign
to harpoon(ers) is merely “a guess based partly on the use of the sign to determine msnw
‘hippopotamus-hunter’, partly on the occurence of a very late word bb . . . mentioned among the
equipment (spears, ropes, etc.) of the msnw. . . . But possibly the sign is really the det. of mTn
‘weave’, ‘plait’, though not so actually found, in which case it would only be phon. det. in msnw
‘hippopotamus-hunter’”.
(2) msn “das Harpunieren (?)” (I., Wb II 145, 9). Existence dubious.
nb: For the supposed verb *msn cf. Godron, ASAE 54, 1957, 195–198 (demonstrating
the non-existence of this gloss, the m- and the alleged msn hrgl. in its sole ex. being
due to a misreading of %rw and jb, resp.); Vergote, CdE 51, 1976, 276 (deriving
-!μ?#"&7 of Gk. gA(!μ?#"&7 from *mass3nu “le harponeur”).
(3) msn (OK) > msn.t (GR) “Name einer Kultstätte des Horus von Edfu” (OK, Wb II 145, 2) = “Harpunierstätte” (Barta, LÄ III 34) and hence msn.j “der von msn (als Beiwort des Horus)” (OK, Wb II 145, 3).
nb1: H. Kees (1956, 213, n. 1, 419, 426) rejected its interpretation as a toponym,
which has been disproved by K. Zibelius (1978, 102–5), who localized it primarily
in the middle of the Delta in the region of Sais and Buto.
nb2: Eg. %r.w msn.j “Horus of msn” is presumably re#ected in Gk. gh(!μ?#"&7
(Osing 1978, 69).
! Etymology disputed. " 1. K. Sethe (ZÄS 54, 1918, 50–54) regarded Eg. *msn as a denominative m- form deriving from Eg. *sn, a word reconstructed on the basis of the hrgl. T22 (phon. value sn) depicting a “Zweizack” (Wb II 148, 4) = “two-barbed spear-head” (EG 1927, 500) = “Speer mit zwei Wiederhaken” (Hintze 1951, 87) = “arrow-head” (Hodge 1976, 12) = “harpoon-point” (Hodge 1981, 410) = “double pronged spear (most often depicted at Edfu in hippopotamus hunting)” (PL 462). Similarly, J. Osing (1978, 69, §9) viewed that Eg. msn.w “kann solange nicht als deverbale Ableitung angesehen werden, wie kein Verbum msn ‘harpunieren’ nachgewiesen und eine etymologische Verbindung (m-Bildung) zu sn ‘Zweizack’ noch möglich ist”. Plausible.
nb1: Eg. *sn is akin to Sem.: Ar. sanna “2. aiguiser, repasser (un couteau), 3. munir de
fer le bois de la lance, 6. percer d’un coup de lance, 7. mordre qqn.”, sin3n- “1. fer
d’une lance, d’un javelot, 2. pierre à aiguiser, queux” [BK I 1146–47] = sin3n- “point
of lance, spear-head”, sanna “to sharpen” [Ember] = sin3n- “Lanzenspitze” [Vrg.] !!!
NBrb.: Shilh a-s/nn3n “épine” [Dst. 1938, 115] = a-s2nnan “thorn” [ Vrg.]. See Ember
1918, 31 (Eg.-Ar.); Alb. 1918, 89 (Eg.-Ar.); Vrg. 1945, 141, #16.b.17 (Eg.-Ar.-Shilh).
nb2: Eg. *sn and Ar. sin3n- have been usually af"liated with the common AA word
for “tooth”, cf. Sem. *šinn- “tooth” [SED I 219, #249; Lsl. 1945, 236; Rabin 1975,

nb3: For the semantic background of Eg. *sn, cf. Sem.: Akk. šêlu “to sharpen”, Sqt.
Ga«al “tooth”, Geez s%l “to sharpen” (Sem.: Lsl. 1945, 244); Eg. n%3.t [< *n%*-t?]
“tooth” (OK, Wb II 304, 5–8) identi"ed by A. Ember (1921, 177; 1926, 302, fn.
10; 1930, #24.b.3) with Ar. na%5*- “sharp, pointed”, na%a*a “to sharpen (a lance),
loosen #esh from bone”.
nb4: Traditionally (cf. e.g. Hintze 1951, 87), Eg. *sn has been associated with Eg.
sn “2” on the analogy of Eg. *w« “die einzackige Harpune” ~ w« “1” (Wb I 273),
which was "rmly declined by A. Ember (1926, 7, fn. 1).
" 2. M. Alliot (1954 II, 702, n. 1) and P. Vernus (LÄ IV 108), in turn, assumed an etymological connection with Eg. msn “Ausdruck für spinnen” (MK, Wb, q.v.) = “tresser, "ler” (Vernus). P. Wilson (PL 462) argues that Eg. msn.w signi"ed the person involved in the hunt for the hippopotamus with the instrument depicted by the hrgl. V32, namely the #oat attached to the harpoon. Rather dubious. " 3. GT: the noteworthy resemblance of Eg. msn to the HECu.-Kotoko isogloss *m-s-n “axe” [GT] is probably due to pure chance.

Grapow (l.c.) assumed in it a late writing of an old *mzn.(t?), which he explained as the m- pre"x nomen instr. of Eg. zn [< *zl?] “abschneiden, zerschneiden, töten” (PT, Wb III 457, 17–21).
nb: The etymology of Eg. zn is still uncertain. (1) W. Schenkel (1993, 145) noted
the variation with Eg. dn, which does not exclude a (2) comparison (GT) with
NBrb.: Shilh *)z-l-w: 2-zlu “töten” [Rsl. 1964, 207] !!! LECu.: Som. dil- “töten”

Hodge (1968, 25) is irreal.

! Origin disputed. " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 29) and W. Federn (1966, 55, fn. 4) assumed it to be the m- pre"x form of Eg. sn% “verkehrt sein (von den in Unordnung gerateten Monaten)” (late NK, Wb IV 169, 3) = “verwirrt, verkehrt, verdreht sein” (Feichtner) = “durcheinandergeraten sein” (GHWb 721), which is, however, a ghost-word. M. K. Feichtner (1932, 220) and Federn (l.c.) postulated here an m- “Ver-balprä!x der Reziprozität”, which “selektiert hier . . . aus einem ‘Wirrwarr vieler Richtungen’ eine Reziprozität zweier Richtungen” (Feichtner) = “a reciprocity of two directions” (Federn).
nb: As pointed out i.a. by R. Caminos (1954 LEM, 172 & 514, n. 13) and Federn
(l.c.), in the only source of sn% (Pap. Anastasi IV, 10:2), the authors of Wb ignored
the b- of bsn% (cf. also DLE l.c.), which should be in fact emended to msn%A(with a
shift of m- > b-). The Wb Belegstellen (ad Wb IV 169, 3) suggested a further pos
sible ex. of sn% making a hint on Urk. II 178:4, which is, however, not valid either.
Here, msn% occurs (Caminos after Sethe: due to “a certain corruption”).
" 2. W. F. Albright (1927, 218), F. von Calice (1936, #204), and A. G. Belova (1987, 277) have also supposed a pre"x m- in it, but avoided Eg. sn% of Wb IV 169, 3. Instead, they compared the purely hypothetic Eg. *sn% with Ar. )sn%.
nb: Cf. Ar. sana%a I “1. se présenter, 4. venir sur qqn., approcher (se dit de la proie),
6. détourner qqn. d’un projet, d’une entreprise”, V “1. tourner le dos à qqn.” [BK

P. Wilson (PL 463), in turn, saw in it an m- pre"x + Eg. sn% “to bind” (semantically doubtful), which, in addition, she falsely regarded as the caus. form of Eg. n%3 (!) “to be contrary”.

1968, 149, fn. 656) = “*Gründungsgrube” (GHWb 363) is dubious (cf. above).
! The GR word may be an m- pre"x nomen loci which derives from Eg. sn2j “gründen, schaffen” (PT, Wb IV 177–178) as suggested in Wb (l.c.), by H. Smith (l.c.), and P. Wilson (PL 463). Cf. also sn2 “Fundament, Grundriß” (MK, Wb IV 178–9).

sa— “demeurer, attendre” [Chn.], but Agaw *— usually stems from Cu./AA *m (cf.
Ehret 1987, 104–6).
nb3: Other etymologies suggested for Eg. sn2j are less convincing. (1) E. Zyhlarz
(1932–33, 99; 1934, 110, #5) compared it mistakenly with SBrb.: Tuareg a-senti

sn2j with NOm.: Mocha š°na(yé) “to make, work” [Lsl.], which displays no match
for Eg. -2- < *-k-.
ms# “gehen” (LEth., Wb II 147, 1) = “marschieren” (Peust). ! Origin uncertain. " 1. C. Peust (1999 phon., 105; 1999 Napat., 230) regarded it as “eine Variante” of old Eg. mš« “to march” (discussed below).
nb: He supposed here “einen Stimmtonverlust des /«/, der auch von anderen koptischen Wörtern

he confessed that “ich kann nicht erklären, warum im Napatanischen die Schreibungen mš«
~ m«š und ms% koexistieren”.
" 2. A. G. Belova (1987, 277; 1989, 11) identi"ed it with Ar. ms% I “8. mesurer (la terre, les champs . . .), 9. traverser, parcourir, arpenter la terre, 10. marcher toute la journée (se dit des chameaux)” [BK II 1102] = “31+0=:*. 9!-0=A"!'*., 9&!4)7. (10+&3), +050-)*., ;)?)*. -1)( 3 -90=0(” [Blv.].
nb: This Eg.-Sem. etymology is rather unlikely due to the signi"cantly different basic
sense (“to measure”) of the Sem. root, cf. Eg. ms0 below.
" 3. GT: or perhaps related the Brb.-Hs. isogloss *m-c-(?) “to move” [GT] (discussed s.v. Eg. mss)? Improbable because of the late and rare attestation of the Eg. root.

Presumably the same word is preserved by ms% (GW) “Gefäß für Öl und Wein (auch wie ein Maß gebraucht)” vs. ms% .t (GW) “Gefäß oder Maß für Öl” (late NK, Wb II 147, 2–3 vs. 4) = “a not very common container, jar (measuring 46 hin)” ( Jansen 1961, 72, 83, 88 with lit.) = “(vessel, jug)” (DLE I 242 after Janssen 1975, 330, fn. 1) = “a measure or container of liquid (used widely in Ramesside times)” (Gdk. 1975, 29, 121) = “1. ein Gefäß (für Wein und Öl), 2. ein Maß (ca. 46 Hin)” (Helck, LÄ III 1203; GHWb 364) = “a vessel” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 81) = ms0
572 ms" – ms#.t



(sg.) vs. ms0.t (pl.?) “amphora, a large vessel (for wine and sesame oil)” (Hoch, 1994, 152–3).
nb1: The OK instance occurs in a marketing scene “where its meaning seems quite obvi
ous” according to H. Goedicke (1957, 69, §1 & fn. 5), who – pace H. Balcz (l.c.)
identi"ed it with the LEg. forms (cf. also WD II 67).
nb2: The LEg. word is written syllabically as ma-Tá-0i vs. ma-Tá-0i-tá (Helck, also
Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 81) = ma-sa-0i (Hoch). Hence, its vocalisation has
been reconstructed as *masa0ta (Helck) = *maši0a vs. *maši03ta (Hoch).
! Etymology debated. Usually regarded as a late borrowing from Sem., but its alleged OK occurence (RdE 11, 1957, 69; WD II 67) – if correct – speaks for a native word. GT: perhaps akin to OAkk. maš0um “(a container)” [Gelb 1973, 185] = “ein Bierbecher” [AHW 625] = “(a vessel used for beer)” [CAD m1, 365]? Note that J. Hoch (1994, 152–3, #198) mentioned (probably erroneously) this etymology as a late Sem. borrowing in LEg.). ! Other etymologies are out of question: " 1. L. Reinisch (1887, 263) combined Eg. ms0 (mistranslated as “epulari”, sic) with Eth.-Sem.: Amh. m2sa “midday meal”, Geez & Tigre & Tna. m2sa% “meal” (Apl. 1977, 29/71; Lsl. 1979 III 426). False. " 2. Later, Reinisch (1890, 276) af"liated Eg. ms0 (erroneously rendered “unguere”, sic) with LECu.: Saho mišhõ “(zerlassene) Butter” (borrowed from ES *ms% “to smear, anoint”). Similarly, W. Helck (1971, 514, #111) explained it from Hbr. mš% “salben” [GB]. False both semantically and phonologically. Rejected by J. Hoch (l.c.) as “impossible” because of Eg. 0 + Sem. *%. " 3. Following GB 467 (after OLZ 3, 208), J. Hoch (1994, 152–3, §198–9) explained it from Akk. (N/LBab.) maš50u, pl. maš503tu “ein Hohlmaß von etwa 1 p3n (30–48 qa)” [AHW 626] = “measure, measuring container (of standardized size, 30 to 54 silas; contents: barley, other cereals, dates, linseed, beer; material: mainly made of wood, clay)” [CAD m1, 366]. Rejected by A. F. Rainey (1998, 443) as “hardly convincing”.
nb1: Although R. Woodhouse (2003, 279, #198) excluded the N/LBab. parallel as
the proper source of Eg. ms0 (as it “does not tally with” the supposed Eg. vocalism),
he too found the semantics of this equation to be “impeccable, even to the cubit capacity”.
Henceforth, he assumed the Eg. word to represent an otherwise unattested Akk.
cstr. state *maša00i “measuring vessel, measure of ” (cf. perhaps OBab. *maša00u,
pl. maša003tu “?”, CAD m1, 353a, bottom?), which he regarded – with a rather
strange and unconvincing etymological argumentation – as a “morpho-semantic”
parallel of Akk. eleppu “ship” < el1pu “to sprout” (cf. “the ship’s mast ‘sprouting’ from
the sea”!) or agammum “marsh” < ag3mu “to rage” (“perhaps due to !ercy re"ections of
sun on the surface of the water”!). Both of these derivations seem to be false (kind p.c.
by J. Huehnergard, 2 Feb. 2007).
nb2: The Akk. term ultimately derives from Sem. *mš% “messen” [GB 467] = *mš0
(so, with false *-0!) “to measure” [Hoch] (with an irreg. -0 < *-%), cf. Akk. maš30u
“(aus)messen (Grundstücke, Gebäude, Gegenstände)” [AHW 623] = “1. to measure,

Eg. Aram. mš%-t (st.cstr.) “Maß” [GB] | Ar. ms% I “8. mesurer (la terre, les champs

[Blv.] (Sem.: Blv. 1993, 45, #254). W. von Soden (AHW 623) af"liated Akk. maš30u
with Ar. masa0a “umformen”, which is semantically weak.
" 4. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 37, §2.1.4.1) and A. F. Rainey (1998, 443, #198–9), in turn, view that the Eg. word originates in a certain root *s0j which, however, they failed to identify.
ms% 3 (vars. ms% ~ msh) “1. sich (über etwas) freuen; 2. (das Herz jemandes) erfreuen” (GR, Wb II 147, 6–13) = “to rejoice (perhaps in the sense ’to celebrate’)” (Smith 1979, 163; PL 464–5).
nb: Its orthographic varieties disclose very little about how its primary root should
be reconstructed (GR -03 may stand also for -0 and vice versa, GR -0 < -03).
! Origin disputed (most convincing seem #2 and #3). " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 18, 29) surmised in it an m- pre"x, but left the underlying root unidenti"ed. H. Smith (1979, 163) and P. Wilson (PL 465) explained it from Eg. s03 “to remember”. Semantically very weak. " 2. A. G. Belova (1987, 277) has probably found the correct equivalent of Eg. *s03 in Ar. s0r.
nb1: Cf. Ar. sa0ira “se moquer, rire de qqn., le railler”, ma-s0ar-at- “1. risée,
moquerie, 2. objet de la risée, "gure ridicule, qui prête à rire” [BK I 1065] =

ma-s0ar-at- “9/0(+0* ")'+0;23, ;C*23” [Blv.]. Ar. ms0r may be denom. from
mas0ar-at-.
nb2: W. Eilers (1987–88, 44) mistakenly considered the -r of Ar. mas0ar-at- as a
root extension (!) on the basis of its false equation with Ar. mas0- “transformed or
metamorphosed into a worse or more foul or more ugly shape” [Lane 2715] =
“Mißgeburt, Cretin” [Eilers].
" 3. GT: alternatively, if Eg. ms03 < *mS0l, cf. SBrb.: EWlm. & Ayr m-&g-l “1. être joli, 2. p.ext. être sympathique, honnête (personne)”, a-m-&gol “1. homme joli, 2. chose perfaitement confectionnée, jolie, 3. beauté, belle femme, 4. homme sympathique” [PAM 1998, 232; 2003, 576].
nb: The Tuareg verb derives from *)&-g-l (with the pre"x m- of the re#exive stem).

ms% 3 “sich verbeugen vor (n)” (GR, Wb II 147, 14). ! As pointed out by H. Grapow (1914, 29), it derives (via pre"x m-) from Eg. s03 “sich verbeugen vor (n)” (GR, Wb III 235, 3), the caus. of 03 “sich beugen” (GR, Wb III 223, 1). M. K. Feichtner (1932, 221) identi"ed m- as the “Verbalpre!x der Reziprozität”, while O. Rössler (1950, 487) de"ned m- as pre"x of the “Sozialstamm (selten, erstarrt)”. Both authors assumed a primary sense “sich voreinander verbeugen”.
nb: A. G. Belova (1987, 277) af"liated Eg. m-s-03 with Ar. 0rr “to fall down”, but this
is akin to Eg. 0r “to fall”. G. Takács (2000, 93, #23.4), in turn, equated Eg. 03 [< *0"]
with SCu. *0o"- “to bend (around, intr.)” [Ehret]: Irq. 0u"-us- “to turn one’s back

inverted bag of linen-sheeting formed by a long rectangle folded over and stitched
up . . ., with a slit being left at the top of each side for the arms, and for sleeves
which could be attached if required. A keyhold-shaped cut, placed at or near the

ankle, had to be made suf"ciently wide to be easily put-on and taken-off . . .” (cf. also
Hall, GM 40, 1980, 29–38, pl. 1). J. M. Johnstone (2002, 595–601) too analyzed its
style and motifs. She distinguished a short version of Eg. mss which appeared in the
MK “worn either belted or loose, with(out) short kilt and apron”, while the long
version spread only in the NK as “a linen cloth of Syrian style”. In the Amarna

nb: Whether the very same Near Eastern Wanderwort is represented by these terms
is not at all evident. Their ultimate origin is not clear either. The speculations
on this question have been usually formulated from the standpoint of Hbr. mes5,
which has no Sem. cognate. In both OT passages (Ezek. 16:10, 16:13) it occurs
in, it is preceded by Hbr. š1š “(Egyptian) linen” [KB 1663], which was borrowed
from Eg. šs. The following scenarios have been proposed in the lit. Ellenbogen
assumed the Hbr. term to have been borrowed from Eg. Rabin (followed by de
Moor): Hbr. and Eg. < Hitt. Alternatively, Rabin derived the Hitt., Hbr., and Eg.
terms from an unde"ned common source. KB: Hbr. < Eg. or Hitt.? DUL: Ug.
and Hbr. < Hitt. ~ (?) Eg. Muchiki rightly stressed the semantic and phonological
(Eg. s + Hbr. š) dif"culties of the Eg.-Hbr. etymology, which he regarded as “open
to the choice” as follows: (1) Hbr. < Eg., (2) Hbr. < Hitt., (3) cognates (!). The latter
choice is certainly excluded. Lipi+ski preferred Hbr. < Eg. and hold Hbr. < Hitt.
or Ar. to be less likely. Hbr. mes5 has been explained by Ben-Yehuda (quoted by
Rabin) directly from Chinese ssu “silk” (!) with a “pre"x” me-, while Guillaume
1965 IV, 9 (quoted also by KB, Muchiki, Lipi+ski) connected the Hbr. word rather
with Ar. wašy- “1. couleur et dessin d’une étoffe à dessin colorié, 3. éclat ondoyant
d’une lame damasquinée, 5. étoffe de soie à "gures ou à ramages” [BK II 1545–6]
= “a kind of variegated or "gured cloth, garment” [Lane 3054] = “silk brocade”
[Guillaume, KB] = “embroidery” [Lipi+ski]. Watson: Ug. < Hitt. via Hurr. (cf. Ug.
cuneiform -nnu). Von Soden connected the Ug.-Hitt. term with Akk. aššijanni “wohl
ein Kleiderstoff ” [AHW 84] = “a decoration sewn on garments” [CAD a2, 465]
(whose ending -nni indicates a borrowing from or via Hurr.). Tischler (HEG l.c.),
in turn, did not exclude the derivation of Hitt. maššiya- from IE *mes- “stricken,

somewhat uncertain because of (B) -r, whereby J. Osing (NBÄ 322, 867, n. 1384)
has reconstructed the underlying etymon as *mãs'r treated as an “m-Bildung” of

“hair, line, stripe” (CD 353b; CED 160) = “Haar, Streifen, Strähne”. The use of
the hrgl. F27 (hide of leopard?) or V7 (loop of cord) in Dem. msr attested as a
gloss to Eg. ms “Ehrfurcht bezeugen” in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD)
also led Osing (1998, 215, n. af ) in the light of (B) mousehr to assuming that
the notion “leather belt (or sim.)” was “vielleicht vom Glossator mit äg. *ms < *msr in
Verbindung gebracht”. This theory, however, fails in explaining the anomaly of (S) -Ø
vs. (B) -hr, the unusual retention of old (MK) -r# in (B) -r as well as the traceless
loss of the whole 2nd syllable in (S) mous instead of *mouse.
! Existence of word and etymology very uncertain. " 1. The rendering “apron” given by E. F. Wente (1967, 73, n. aa) seems to suggest an equation with Eg. mss (above). Similarly, G.

groups for -s-.
" 1. J. Osing (NBÄ 206, 744, n. 900; cf. KHW 520), in the light of (B) metsobi, reconstructed *m'tbãs.'t (sic, with *-tb-), which he explained (via met.) as an “m-Bildung” of Eg. tbs “stechen (vom Dorn)” (GR, Wb V 262, 10) = “to prick, pierce” (PL 1133) > Cpt. (SA) twbs “anstacheln, antreiben, stechen, stoßen” (KHW 223). This etymology was (probably rightly) ignored by W. Vycichl (l.c.).
nb: A. H. Gardiner (HPBM III 17, nn. 2–3) identi"ed the etymon of GR tbs with late
NK dbs “to prick” (DLE IV 130; PL 1134), which speaks against Osing’s *Àssãb'
< *m'ssãb' < *m'tsãb.'(t) < *m'tbãs.'t. Moreover, (B) -ts- is not an absolute
proof for old *-ts- > *-ss-, cf. (S) mejpw(w)ne, mevpwne, (A) mavpwne, (B)
me(t)vfwni < old mšpn.t (discussed below), where an etymon *mtšpn.t or sim.

related directly to the AA root described above (contra AHW; Dlg. 1983, 137; Lsl.

msq (GW) “Art Bearbeitung von Metallwaffen” (XIX. hapax: Pap. Koller 1:7, Wb II 150, 1) = “aus-, wegziehen, -putzen” (Rn. 1887, 265–6) = “zerkleinern” (Thausing 1941, 22, fn. 1) = “(mng. unknown, old pf. qualifying the ‘facings’)” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 434) = “ziseliert” (Helck, MWNR II 197) = “Tatigkeit der Metallwaffenbearbeitung” (Helck 1971, 514, #112) = “schärfen” (KHW 520) = “frapper, battre (le métal)” (AL 77.1876, 78.1866) = “activity of a metal worker” (DLE I 243) = “metal working, a metallurgical activity pertaining to the making of weapons” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 24, 81) = “a metalworking activity: to emboss, hammer (?), hammered work (?)” (Hoch 1994, 153, §200 & 173, §229) = “(Metall) schmieden, schlagen” (GHWb 365).
nb1: Syllabic spelling: ma-Tá-qa (Hoch) = ma-Ta-qa (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey).
nb2: J. Hoch (1994, 172–3, §229) treated msq as the met. of mgs (GW) “Verbum von
der Arbeit am Schurz einer Statue” (XX., Wb II 164, 15) = “a metal working activity:
to emboss, hammer (?)” (Hoch). D. Meeks (1997, 43, §229), however, demonstrated
that of the two exx. of mgs suggested by Hoch, only that attested in Pap. Turin
(P + R) 32:5 (KRI VI 335:9) might "t msq of Pap. Koller 1:7, while mgs of Pap.
Turin (P + R) 32:7 (KRI VI 335:12) is merely a wtg. of mks “sceptre” (as correctly
indicated in Wb II 164 and Hoverstreydt 1997, 110, n. g, rendered in Woodhouse
2003, 280, §229 alternatively as “document case”), which has thus nothing to do
with the former two exx. For mgs in Pap. Chester Beatty V see HPBM III, vol. I,
49, n. 9. D. Meeks (l.c.) has regarded it also as dubious whether msq (Pap. Koller
1:7) and mgs (Pap. Turin P + R 32:5) represent the same word.
nb3: Is msq (knife det.) “ob Waffe (?)” (BD, Wb II 149, 18) = “(Subst.)” (GHWb
366) connected?
! Hence: Cpt. (SMF) mousk, (B) mosk+ “1. to strike, rub (?), 2. be sharpened be whetting (?)” (CD 186b) = “1. schlagen, 2. reiben, schärfen” (KHW 102).
nb: Its derivation from msq of Pap. Koller 1:7 was suggested by G. Fecht (KHW
520) and by J. Osing (1978, 189).
! Etymology highly debated. " 1. L. Reinisch (1887, 265–6) suggested semantically untenable Sem. cognates.
nb: Such as Hbr. mšk qal “ziehen” [GB 468], Ar. mšq I “5. déchirer (une robe),
6. abîmer (la jambe), froisser par sa rudesse (se dit d’un vêtement neuf qui n’est
pas encore assoupli)”, IV “fouetter”, V “1. être déchiré, lacéré”, VIII “2. couper,
retrancher une partie de la chose)” [BK II 1111–2], Ar. msk I “mettre la main
sur . . .” [BK II 1105].
" 2. O. Bates (1914, 82) equated Eg. msq “to pluck off, snatch” (sic) with Brb. *m-z (sic, correctly *m-K) “to seize, take away”. False.
msq 583



" 3. G. Thausing (1941, 22, fn. 1) and D. Meeks (1997, 43, §229) regarded it as the m- pre"x form of Eg. sqr > (OK) sqj “schlagen” (PT, Wb IV 306). Unconvincing, since the function of m- here has not been cleared.
nb: Thausing extended this etymology also to Eg. %sq “abschneiden, abhauen”
and jsq (sic).
" 4. R. Caminos (1954 LEM, 161) surmised a connection with Eg. nqs (Pap. Anastasi IV, rt. 7:11–8:1) ~ nsq (Pap. Anastasi I, 18:3) “bildlich von boshaften Reden (?)” (Wb II 336, 16). Similarly, D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 16, §1.2.2.1 & 24, §1.2.6) assumed Eg. *ma22aqa to derive “evidently” from *man2aqa (cf. also Vittmann 1997, 283), which they regarded as an m- pre"x noun connected with Sem. *n2” re#ected by Ug. n2q “a weapon: missiles, projectile, dart (?)”
[DUL 654], Hbr. n1šeq ~ nešeq “Waffen, Rüstung” [GB 528] = “equipment, weapons” < nšq II qal “to take one’s place in rank, acquiesce, 2. be armed (with a bow)”, hi"l “to touch one another (#apping wings?)” [KB 731] and eventually “probably” also Eg. nsq (GW) “sharp sayings”. Semantically dubious. " 5. W. Helck (1971, 514, #112) remained neutral: “Ableitung unsicher”. " 6. J. Hoch (1994, 173, §229) af"liated Eg. *maqaša (sic) with “(hammered/embossed) metal-work” with Hbr. miqš3 “gedrehte, gedrechselte Arbeit”, miqše “gedrehte Arbeit (von künstlich ge#ochtenen Haaren)” [GB 457]. Semantically weak.
nb: In Hoch’s view, the underlying Hbr. root ()qšy) is only known as a m- preforma
tive noun, but cf. Hbr. qšy qal “hart, schwer sein (Grundbedeutung fest drehn?)”
[GB 732].
" 7. GT: or perhaps related to Geez masaqa ~ maTaqa “to carve, hew” [Lsl. 1987, 366]?
nb: W. Leslau (l.c.) quotes a Geez var. form n- considered to be original.
" 8. GT: semantically, most attractive seems its genetic cognacy with WCh.: Ngz. màgsú “to #atten out, squash, smooth with rubbing motion” [Schuh 1981, 109], which would imply that Eg. mgs displays the original root.
msk3 (OK-NK) > msq (from XVIII.) “Haut, Fell eines Tiers, Leder” (PT, Wb II 150, 3–5 & II 149, 10–14) = “leather” (FD 118; WD III 56) = “oxhide” (DLE I 243) = “Haut von Tieren (Stier, Nilpferd, Schlange), Fell” (GHWb 365) = “leather, hide, skin of an animal” (PL 466).
nb: F. W. von Bissing (1955–56, 334) suggested an uncertain OK attestation of the
late var. msq (V., Abusir), which has not been con"rmed in ÄWb I. Drenkhahn
(1976, 12) supposes that the form msk3, which is “nur bis zum N.R. belegt”, was “danach
584 msk3



vermutlich durch das seitdem M. R. belegte d%r abgelöst”, although J. J. Janssen (1975, 398,
fn. 1) stressed the semantical distinction of MK msk3 “hide” vs. d%r “leather”.
! Etymology uncertain. Already H. Grapow (1914, 30) surmised a pre"x m- in it, but was unable to identify the underlying root. " 1. Most of the authors treat it as a probable cognate of Sem. *mašk“pelle (tolta dal corpo)” [Frz.] = *ma/išk- “skin” [SED], but the anomaly of Eg. -3 vs. Sem. *-Ø is a serious hindrance.

this is hardly convincing, cf. rather AA *m-s-K “part of leg” [GT] (discussed s.v.
Eg. msd.t infra, cf. also Eg. ms0tjw supra).
nb2: The Sem. term is probably of deverbal origin (lit. “das Abgezogene” as usually
suggested in the lit. after L. Koehler, cf. GB 468; Frz. 1964, 266, #2.30; Lsl. 1969,

*-mšuk- “scuoiare” [Frz.] = *ms1k “to pull” [Faber] (discussed s.v. Eg. ms2.t).
nb3: Accepting the equation of Eg. msk3 ~ Sem. *mašk-, P. Lacau (1970, 150,
#406) considered Eg. msk3 to be an ancient m- pre"x form of an unattested Eg.
*sk3 (“la correspondence avec héb. mšk indiquerait qu’il s’agit d’une formation ancienne en m
pré!xe . . . remontant au fonds commun”), which, however, certainly excludes the connection
with Sem. *mašk-, in which *m- was not at all a pre"x.
nb4: The Sem. term was borrowed (via Akk. or Aram.) into a number of non-AA
lgs.: Gk. (Hesychios, Nikandros) μ+)*'+ (- $G0&9", 0+(μ)) “pelle” [Mayer] = “skin,
leather” [KB] (Reinisch 1873, 272, fn. 3; Mayer 1960, 90), OPers. mašk3- “in#ated
skin” > NPers. mask (Kent 1953, 203), OIndic maTáka- (m) “leather bag” [MW
1899, 793] (Rn. l.c.), and (via some Iranian source) Burushaski mašk “skin bag for
carrying water” [Boisson] = “skin for water” [KB] (Boisson 1989, 10).
nb5: L. Reinisch (1887, 362) and M. Cohen (1947, #471) erroneously af"liated the
Sem.-Eg. isogloss with NAgaw: Bilin wåša‘ã “gegerbte Kuhhaut, welche man aufbreitet
um darauf zu schlafen” [Rn.] = wašaqa “peau, cuir (servant de couche)” [Rn.], which
derives in fact from NAgaw *wV'ä3-a “leather for sleeping on it” [Apl. 2006, 83].
nb6: Some authors opinion that either Eg. msk3 (OK) may be a very early loan
from Sem. (Conti 1978, 84, fn. 4; HSED #1744) or NK msq was a late borrowing
msk3 585



from Can. (Helck 1962, 506, #4; 1971, 506, fn. 4), but both scenarios are false.
Neither OK -3 can be explained from Sem. *-Ø nor NK msq can be separated
from OK-NK msk3.
nb7: L. Bender (1975, 185, §72.1) connected Akk. mašku “skin” with ES: Geez ma"is
“skin” and CCh.: Margi Öm'ì “skin (of man)” [Hfm. apud RK 1973, 101 & JI] =
ínšì" [IL/JI 1994 II, 296] on a biconsonantal basis. But the origins of the Geez and
Margi words are uncertain (for further discussion cf. Eg. *ms above).
" 2. G. Maspero (1908, 176) derived it from a biconsonantal root which he af"liated with Eg. *ms “peau de chacal”, mss “cuirasse formé d’un cuir”, Cpt. (S) mous “lorum, corium pour les sandales”. False. The origin of Eg. -k3 would remain unexplained. " 3. E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 172) combined it with Nub.: Kunuzi & Dongola busug “Ledersack”, which is equally unconvincing. " 4. C. T. Hodge (1991, 641) equated Eg. msk3 [< *mskl] with Hbr. maGk5l (- LXX ?#"+?!67, Vulgate intellectus), whose rendering is debated. Certainly excluded for a number of reasons.
nb: The Hbr. term has been translated as “Bezeichnung einer Psalmenart,
(gewöhnlich übersetzt als) Lehrgedicht, vielleicht eher Huldigungslied” [GB 465] =
“Meditation, Nachdenekn” [Delitzsch] = “cult song” [Kittel] = memory passage”
[Maag] = “wisdom song performed to music” [Mowinckel] = “a parchment docu
ment” [Hodge] (cf. KB 641), which hardly accords with Eg. msk3. In addition, the
underlying root is Hbr. Gkl hi"l “Acht geben, einsichtsvoll betrachten, verständnisvoll
sein usw.” [GB 785–6] = “to understand, comprehend, have insicht” [KB 1328],
which has hardly anything to do with the notion of “skin”. Besides, Eg. -s- vs. Hbr.
-G- would be also irregular.
" 5. C. Boisson (1989, 10) related it with Sem.: Akk. maškaru “Schwimmschlauch” [AHW 627] = “waterskin (used for #oating and wine)” [CAD m1, 374] !! Ug. mškr-t “skin (?)” [DUL 591]. Unlikely.
nb: This is apparently a *ma-pras- nomen instr. stem, which was derived by
W. von Soden (AHW l.c.) from Akk. šak3ru “betrunken werden” [AHW 1139],
which does not "t Eg. msk3.
" 6. GT: the hypothetic Eg. simplex *sk3 might perhaps represent an older variety (prior to the "rst Eg. palatalization) of Eg. s23 [< *sk"]
“ziehen” (PT, Wb IV 351–353).
nb1: For the supposed parallels of Eg. s23 in Bed., Yaaku, SBch., Tobanga see Takács
1999, 111, #57; 1999, 351.
nb2: For the semantic shift cf. e.g. Sem. *mašk- < *mšk (above), Norwegian tinder

1065–6), or Gk. 0+(μ) < 0+(6.
mskj “Gerücht, Klatsch” (Lit. MK, Wb II 150, 7; GHWb 365) = mskj n md.t “slander (?)” (FD 118) = “rumeur, médisance” (AL 77.1878).
nb: Attested also in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD) as msk “Vorwurf (?)”
with an OCpt. gloss mousk (Osing 1998, 77, n. h), which speaks against the proposal
by W. Westendorf (KHW 559) to explain Eg. mskj as the etymon of Dem. šmšk
586 mskj



“zischen” (DG 512:1) = “to hiss” (CED) > Cpt. (SL) vmvhCe, (B) vmvhji “to
whisper” (CD 568a) = “zischeln, wispern, spotten” (KHW 315). Because of Dem.
-k, equally unlikely is the proposal by J. ,erný (CED 245) to project the etymon of
the Cpt. verb as *šem«s1ded, the compound of Eg. šm« > (S) vma “to be(come s)
light” + Eg. s3d > (S) vaje “talking”, lit. “lightness of talk”.
" 1. J. Osing (1998, 77, n. h) suggests that it is “wohl eine m-Ableitung zu” Eg. sk “Beschwerde gegen jem., Beschuldigung jemds.” (MK, Wb IV 313, 11–12), which seems convincing.
nb: Eg. sk has been usually equated with Ar. škw: šak3 I “1. se plaindre de qqch.
à qqn., 2. souffrir de quelque mal, 3. affecter, faire souffrir qqn., lui causer de la
douleur”, šak3"-, šik3y-at-, šakw-at-, šakw3 “plainte” [BK I 1261] !! Geez säkäyä

" 2. GT: because of Eg. -j, much less likely seems a relationship to Akk. mas3ku (var. -š-) “schlecht sein, werden” [AHW 618] = mas3ku (var. -š-) G “to be ugly, bad”, Š “to give a bad name”, N “to become bad, receive blame”, mas/šiktu “bad reputation, bad feelings, wrongdoing” [CAD m1, 322–3].
msktw (var. msktwj) “Armring (am Unterarm) aus Gold oder Leder” (XVIII., Wb II 150, 8–9) = “armlet” (FD 118) = “breite, gewölbte, über dem Handgelenk sitzende Armreife mit #achen Rändern” (Staehelin, LÄ I 442) = “Unterarmreifen (gelegentlich tönnchenförmig, meist am rechten, ab und zu an beiden Handgelenken getragen)” (Feucht, LÄ II 731) = “Gegenstück für m0tb.t (breiter #acher Ring um das linke Handgelenk) am rechten Handgelenk (tönnchenförmig)” (Edel 1987, 45) = “Unterarmreif (aus Gold oder Leder)” (GHWb 365).

nb2: The rdg. msk.wt (suggested by Edel l.c.) is improbable due to the standard
wtg. of its Auslaut as -tw.
! Etymology uncertain. Neither of the proposals explain the ending -tw. " 1. A. G.

Lauth (1871, 635, §138) combined it with Hbr. mass1k3 II “Decke” [GB 440] = “covering” [KB 605] = “fusio metalli” [Lauth], ma- pre"x form of nsk II “#echten, weben” [GB 508] = “to plait, braid” [KB]. Semantically unlikely. " 3. L. Reinisch (1873, 280, fn. 2) linked it to Aram. pešak “palma manus” and Kanuri and Teda-Kanem musko “Hand”. Both suggestions are out of question. " 4. H.

" 3. I. Grumach-Shirun (LÄ III 741, n. 10) af"liated it with Eg. msd.t “Kleidungsstück” (PT 416) and msd.t ~ mstj “(nicht Korb, sondern) auf Seilbasis ge#ochtene Tasche” (NK, below) used parallel with 43r “Sack” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 408).

! Interpretation and etymology obscure. Presumably an m- pre"x derivation, but the underlying root has not yet been convincingly identi"ed. " 1.

" 2. GT: or should we assume Eg. *st3? This could be a regular match of either Ar. )stl or )s9l.
nb1: Cf. either (1) Ar. satala “sortir à la suite l’un de l’autre (se dit, p.ex., des gouttes

pris le meilleure partie” [BK I 1050–1] or (2) less probably Ar. sa9ala VII–VIII
“s’enivrer, s’étourdir de la boisson préparée avec une herbe” [BK I 1089] = sa9ala
I “to intoxicate (said of a medicine, a vulgar word)”, VII–VIII “to be in a state of
intoxication produced by the herb %aš5š- or perhaps species of herb” [Lane 1359]
= sa9ala VII “se prendre de vin, s’achever de peindre, achever de s’enivrer, être ravi

pour la verser sur le corps, 2. bénitier” [BK] = “small vessel having a loop-shaped
handle” [Lane] is not a Persian loan-word (as pointed out by R. Dozy l.c.).
" 3. A.G. Belova (1987, 277) compared Eg. *st3 with Sem. *šty “to drink” [GT], which is not at all convincing there being no correspondence between Eg. -3 vs. Sem. *-y.
mstj.wt “Galeeren” (Thotmes III, hapax: Pap. BM 10056, rt. 8:13, Helck MWNR 877, 887, after Glanville). The same word is attested in mstj (f ) “Art Schiff ” (late XIX., hapax: Pap. Anastasi IV 10:4, Wb II 151, 9) = “an unidenti"ed type of vessel, many-oared boat with a fairly small craft: naval cutters (?)” (Glanville 1932, 16–17, §32) = “a many-oared boat” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 173) = “boat” (DLE I 243) = “kind of boat” ( Jones 1988, 140, §42) = “small galley propelled by oars (must be a vessel of fairly large bank of oars, which were relatively small, and dependent upon larger war ships)” (Hoch 1994, 153) = “mit vielen Ruderern bemanntes Boot” (Dürring 1995, 148 after LEM).

nb: The oldest var. (Dyn. VI) has -t- (PT 40 + 12, spell 57K-L, cf. AEPT Suppl. 2).
! Origin uncertain, but most convincing seems etymology #1. H. Grapow (1914, 31) has already surmised the pre"x m- in it (although left the underlying root unidenti"ed). " 1. F. Buhl (GB 553; KB 771) and V.M. Illi'-Svity' (1966, 322, #2.24) regarded it as the nomen instr. of an Eg. (*)str ~ Sem. *str “9!/'2/%-)*.” [IS]: Hbr. str nifal “sich verbergen, verborgen sein”, sitr3 “Schirm, Schutz”, s1ter “1. Versteck, 2. Hülle, 3. Schirm, Schutz” [GB 553–4], Ar. satara I “(re)couvrir avec un voile, cacher” [BK I 1049] = “schützen, decken, verhüllen” [GB] etc. Possible both semantically and phonologically.
nb1: The supposed Eg. str is probably unattested, cf. the etymology suggested by
D. Meeks (#3).
nb2: GB compared also also Akk. šataru (hapax var. to šut$ru, OAkk. tut$rum)
“Kleidername” [GB] = “ein Prachtgewand” [AHW 1294] (which is in fact a Sum.
borrowing) and OSA h-Gtr “beschützen” [GB] = “to protect” [KB after Müller,
ZAW 75, 1963, 312].
nb3: Sem. *str has been usually identi"ed with Eg. št3 [< *štr] “geheim” (PT, Wb
IV 551–3), cf. Holma 1919, 45; Rsl. 1971, 304; Castellino 1984, 16; Dlg. 1987,
203, #62.
" 2. G. Jéquier (1921, 148; 1921, 18, fn. 2) explained it as the m- pre"x (or rather prepositional) form (rendered as “en matière "lée”, sic) of Eg. st (sic) “tordre, "ler”, which is in fact a late wtg. of s23 “spinnen” (PT, Wb IV 355). False.
nb: Jéquier supposed Eg. mst.w “Art Beutel” (MK hapax: Cairo cof"n 28027, Wb,
cf. above) to re#ect a var. without -r, “d’après laquelle on constate que la sonnante !nale -r
n’est pas . . . un élément indispensable du radical ” (sic).
" 3. D. Meeks (1977, 79–83, esp. 83) derived it from Eg. str ~ z2r “emmailloter, enrouler dans des bandelettes” (CT I 278g) = “(die
590 mstr.t – mztr.t ~ ms&r



Mumie) mit Binden umhüllen” (LP, Wb IV 344, 7) = “*einwickeln (in Binden)” (GHWb 786) and s2r.t “paupière” (XVIII. BD, Meeks) = “*oberes Augenlid” (GHWb 786), which he treated as originally caus. of a hypothetic Eg. *2r “(re)couvrir, faire couvercle” (Meeks) reconstructed from 2r.wt “le couvert boisé (?)” = “(als Dorfname)” (Wb V 387, 1) and 2r.t “Weide” (PT, Wb V 385–6) = “saule” (BIFAO 31, 177–226). The derivation from Eg. str is probably right, albeit the reconstruction of Eg. *str is problematic. " 4. J. Osing (1979, 13 & fn. 1; 2001, 577, fn. 118), being apparently unfamiliar with the paper by D. Meeks (1977), derived it from Eg. stj “knüpfen” (OK, Wb IV 330, 2–4), which he explained “nach der späten (!) Form str118, wohl stj < str” (Osing 2001, 577, fn. 118: “Wb IV 344, 5–7. Vgl. auch mstr.t Art Gewebe und der aus ihm gefertigte Schurz”), cf. str “Halskragen, Schmuck herstellen” (LP-GR, Wb IV 344, 5–6). This is probably mistaken as demonstrated by G. Takács (2005, 25–26, §1.13).
nb: First, the OK occurences of the verb stj were never written with an additional
-r (Wb l.c.). So also the OK nominal re#ex: stj “Halsbandknüpfer” (OK frequent,
ÄWb I 1253). The hapax str.w “*Halskragenmacher” (1x, Meir, reign of Pepi II,
ÄWb I 1259) can hardly be used for proving the alleged old *str, since this sole
occurence from the late VIth Dyn. may well be the case of a pseudohistorization.
In addition, its interpretation is dubious. Secondly, LEg. str “(die Mumie mit) Binden
umhüllen” has a signi"cantly differing sense from that of OK stj, which, besides, has
been identi"ed by V. Bla&ek (1991, 365) with Sem. *šty “to kni/ot” [GT] > Akk.
)atû “(Fäden) knüpfen” [AHW] !! Hbr. )ty “weben” [GB], PBHbr. )2t5 “der Aufzug

1924 IV 617] !! Ar. satan [< *satay-un] “woof, pattern in a garment, (a part of ) a
garment” [Lane 1306b] (Sem.: GB 866; KB 1667, 1669; AHW 1203).
mstr (GW) “Büro” (XVIII. 2x: Pap. Petersburg/Leningrad 1116B, vs. 60, 70, 75, 78 & Pap. BM 10056, 10:2, Helck 1971, 514 after Glanville 1931, 105f.) = “perhaps the name of a large compound enclosing a number of šmm.wt, or perhaps a foreign word for such a place or for ‘customs house’ ” (Glanville 1931, 108) = “bureau des écrits” (AC 1978, 14; AL 77.1882) = “of"ce” (Sivan & CochaviRainey 1992, 81) = “of"ce, chancellery” (Hoch 1994, 154) = “ein Gebäudekomplex, der Speicher umfaßt und Holz liefern kann, vielleicht Sägewerk” (Quack 1996, 510) = “Kanzlei” (WD II 67).
nb1: Syllabic spelling: maT-tá-r (Helck) = máT-tá-r (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992,
81) = mas-ti3-ra (Hoch).
nb2: The rendering “bureau” is purely based on its traditional comparison with
Sem. *š9r “to write” (below).
! Rendering and etymology disputed. " 1. W. Helck (1971, 514, #113) and J. Hoch (1994, 154–5, §202) assumed Eg. *maš9ira (Hoch) to re#ect a borrowed nomen loci of Sem.
mstr 591



*š9r “to write”, which is hindered by a number of obstacles. Thus, as rightly noted by E. A. Knauf (1982, 38) and J. F. Quack (1996, 510), one would have to admit two irreg. correspondences at a time (Eg. -s- < Can. *-š- vs. Eg. -t- < Can. *-9-). In addition, Hoch failed to specify which Can. m- pre"x nomen loci he prefers as the proper source denoting the “place of writing or where documents were kept” (which apparently cannot even be pointed out for OCan.). This etymology was excluded also by R. Woodhouse (2003, 279, #202) arguing that Quack and Rainey (below) presented “equally good ” etymologies.
nb1: On the basis of the available re#exes in Akk., Ug., and Hbr., it is dif"cult to
project such a term for ESem. or Can. and it is even more risky to presume such a
term to have been borrowed prior to the 15th cent. BC from OHbr. by the Egyptians
(and not vice versa), cf. Akk. maš9aru “inscription, text” [CAD m1, 396] !! Hbr. *miš93r
“Herrschaft, Amt (des Himmels über die Erde), die sternenbesäte Firmament” [GB
468] = “Amtsgewalt” [Knauf ] = “writing in the heavens”, meaning the stars in the
sky” [KB 645], Punic mš9r “(subst. indicating) a military function, military of"cer
(?) whose function is administrative”, mš9rh “(subst. probably meaning) military
administration” [DNWSI 700]. No Ug. re#ex with pre"x m-.
nb2: The borrowing from OHbr. was declined by Knauf (l.c.) also because there
“die Wurzel ursprünglich fremd gewesen zu sein scheint”, Hbr. šo91r “Beamter” and *miš93r
“Amtsgewalt” (sic) being “beides Lehnwörter in der Verwaltungssprache”.
" 2. E. A. Knauf (1982, 38, n. 26): “vielleicht” a nomen loci related to Syr. šaddar “schicken, senden (e.g. Schriftstücke, Briefe)” (no arguments provided). Baseless. " 3. A. F. Rainey (1998, 443, #202), considering “a theoretical *maTdir is as possible as *maš9ir” in Eg., combined it with Hbr. G2d1r3 “an architectural feature of the Jerusalem temple”. This is also a pure guess with no evidence for an m- pre"x re#ex that could be regarded as the source of Eg. mstjr. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 22, §1.2.5.3 & 26, §1.2.8.1) vacillated between this vs. Helck’s etymology. " 4. J. F. Quack (1996, 510, #202), confessing that “die korrekte Etymologie bleibt zu suchen”, viewed that if it was really a Sem. loan-word, then “wäre eine Verbindung mit der Wurzel Ttr ‘zerreißen’ phonetisch am naheliegendsten”. Unconvincing, since Quack failed in demonstrating any Sem. mnomen loci of this root which might be identi"ed with Eg. mstjr.

Helck’s etymology “impossible”.

Eg. evidence: “subjects”/“carrier” < lit. *“(those under) the yoke” < “shoulder”

364b; CED 166) = “Augenschminke (Ko%l)” (KHW 201) represents the very same
lexeme, is to be excluded. P. Lacau (1903, 152) derived (S) sthm from *ÀsdÉm/t
supposing the loss of m- before a cluster. J. H. Breasted (1930, 489) also supposed
msdm.t to have been “corrupted into sthm” (apparently so also in CED 166, where
both sdm and msdm.t are mentioned as etyma). Similarly, H. Grapow (1950, 73–74)
explained the Cpt. form either via a “mobile” m- pre"x or with an erosion of
*m/sd\–m/t > */sd\–m/t > */sd\–m. G. Fecht (1960, 180–1, fn. 505) has disputed
these views and rightly derived the Cpt. word from Eg. sdm.(w) “Schminke (für die
Augen)” (OK, Wb IV 370, 9), where he explained (B) -q- ?%1μB with the in#uence
of the posttonic -d- of *m's]'d'm't > *m's]'dm't.
nb2: Eg. sdm passed into Gk. ?%1μμ&7 ~ ?%1μμ& ~ ?%1μB ~ ?%1O& “eye-paint made of
antimony” [Grd.] = “noire d’antimoine pour se teindre les cils, les sourcils” [Vcl.]
> Lat. stimmi ~ stibi ~ stibium “Spießglas, schwarze Schminke” [LEW] = “anti
mony” (Brugsch 1891, 30–31, §3; Boisacq 1916, 912; Jéquier 1921, 154; Breasted
1930, 489; LEW II 591; WÄDN 289; KHW 201; DELC 199 etc.). (S) stmnkbt
“?%&μμM $9/%&$'"”, in the view of A.-A. Saleh (1972, 146), “probably refers to the region
through which it passed in transport ”. S. Aufrère (1984, 13) too saw in it the “souvenir
du fait que la galène transitait par Coptos”. W. G. E. Watson (1998, 755, §10) surmised
the trace of Eg. sdm in Ug. sdm “Kohl” (hapax, restored from: thgrn [s]dm “they
(i.e. her eyes) are surrounded by eye-shadow”), which is, however, not con"rmed
in either of the standard lexicons of Ug. (Gordon 1955, 300; WUS 218; DLU I
398; DUL 753).
nb3: As noted i.a. by J. R. Harris (1961, 174), the “nature of this black eye-paint has been
widely misunderstood, owing to the fact that ?%1μμ& and stibium refer principally to antimony
compounds, stibnite etc.”. But already A. Wiedemann (l.c.), V. Loret (quoted apud Harris
1961, 174, fn. 19), and A. H. Gardiner (1917, 37) declined its equation with (the
eye-paint made of ) antimony. The rendering of msdm.t by A. Wiedmann (l.c.) as a
compound of substances, most importantly among them lead sulphide (galena), was
supported by a number of scholars, e.g., Hofmann and Loret quoted by J. R. Harris
(1961, 174, fn. 18–19), who convincingly reaf"rmed and established the validity of
this suggestion. Besides, the Cpt. term for antimony was (B) basour (CD 44b; KHW
28). A further argument used by A. H. Gardiner (1917, 37) against antimony was
the late NK hapax ( jnr n) msd.t “als Material für die Sockel (?) der Flaggenmasten”
(RT 8, 1886, 9, pl. 4, Wb II 152, 15) = “stone for making of #ag-staffs” (Grd.:
Pap. Harris 41a:8, 53a:13) = “the material of two #agpoles of a model temple or
perhaps their bases” (Harris) = “*eine Steinsorte” (GHWb 366) explained by him
as an “abbreviation” of msdm.t, which is more than doubtful. Although he hold a
corruption of msdm.t “not impossible”, J. R. Harris (1961, 83–84) was rightly disturbed
that no parallel ex. of *jnr n msdm.t can be found and henceforth he was disposed
to regard it rather as a hapax “the meaning of which cannot be determined ”.
! Nomen instr. (pre"x m-) of Eg. sdm “schminken” (PT, Wb IV 370, 3–8) = sdmj (Grapow; Lacau after Sethe 1899 I, §305).

nb: The etymology of Eg. sdm is disputed.
(1) Its connection with Ar. "u2mud- ~ "i2mid- “antimoine dont on fait le collyre”
[BK I 235] = "i2mid- “an ore of antimony or antimony itself, stibium or stimmi,

whence the best is obtained, and in the West, whence the hardest is obtained, a

or collyrium itself or a substance resembling it (said to be an arabicized word)”
[Lane 352] ="i2mid- ~ "a2mud- (sic) “Antimon, zur Herstellung von Augenschminke”

1985, 171, #11; Saleh 1972, 145; DELC 199; Blv. 1987, 276). But it is not clear if
we should assume a met. in Eg. (sdm < *smd) or in Ar. (2md from *2dm). It cannot
be decided either if the Ar. word (isolated in Sem.) is a loan-word from Eg. Some
authors, however, suggested a reverse way of borrowing. W. M. Müller (l.c.): “Herkunft
schwer zu entscheiden, obwohl ich schließlich auch es eher als nichtägyptisch ansehen möchte”.
A.-A. Saleh (l.c.) treated this alleged Eg. < Sem. borrowing as a “linguistic evidence”
of that the eye cosmetic occured in Arabia or it was “imported from other country to the
African coast”, since the genuine Ar. "i2mid “was not available in Egypt, but in Arabia,
also Asia Minor and Persia” (the only valuable item of the imports, brought by Ibsha,
chief of the Aamu, to Khnumhotep, monarch of the Oryx nome under Sesostris
II, was msdm.t), while materials of other eye-paints (malachite, galena) were Eg.
products (Lucas 1962, 83, 196). Note that Ar. "i2mid- strikingly resembles the Gk.
stem ?%1μ(μ)&0-, cf. gen. ?%1μ(μ)&097. R. M. Voigt (kind p.c., 13 Feb. 2007) too "nds it
plausible, “daß das arabische "i2mid- nicht direkt aus dem Ägyptisch-Koptischen gekommen sein
kann. Wegen des auslautenden -d muß das Griechische als Vermittler angenommen werden”. If the
Ar. term comes from Gk., it makes its direct comparison with Eg. sdm baseless.

12. For Sem.-Eg.-Hausa: SISAJa II, 76–77, #154. T. H. Gaster (1944, 21) compared
Ar. dmm with a certain Ug. dm “coating” (hapax, in: šmr0t b-dm 0r) “overlain

sdm with Ar. damma%ara “das Auge mit Kollyr behandeln”. This second solution,
however, does not explain the mng. of the hypothetic Eg. simplex.

" 1. M. K. Feichtner (1932, 221), O. Rössler (1950, 488), and W. Schenkel (1983, 12) analyzed the "rst consonant in both antonyms, namely Eg. ms3j and mrj “to like” (supra), as a fossilized m- pre"x representing “Reziprozität” (Feichtner) = “Sozial-Verba, Sozialstamm” (Rsl.) = “an old (prehistoric) pre"x” (sic) (Snk.). Baseless.
nb: Neither of the presumed Eg. simplexes (viz. *s3j and *rj, resp.) can be justi"ed
etymologically (on the contrary, the m- of mrj was certainly part of the original
AA root), although, in any case, an m- pre"x, at least in the case of ms3j, cannot
be ruled out de"nitely.

nb2: The LEg. etymon mšt (from *mšd < *ms3) of the Cpt. (PL) re#ex is supposed
by W. Westendorf (1978, 154–7, §3) to have been preserved in Eg. mšt( j)-pnw (GW)
“P#anzenart, die zu Kränzen verwendet wird” (late NK school texts 3x, Wb I 136,
4: mistakenly read as jšt-pnw) = “(nicht unser ‘Vergißmeinnicht’, sondern) ein zu
derselben Familie gehörendes Bor(r)etschgewächs, das als Küchen- und Gewürz
p#anze diente” (Wst. 1978, 156) = “Vergißmeinnicht” (GHWb 369), cf. also AL
78.1873, 1884; Lauth 1871, 635, §141 (with a false etymology). Westendorf (1978,
156) located the dialect used in the school texts in question “in einem Gebiet . . . des
späteren Subachmimischen” or where later “vom Achmimischen beein"ußtes Sahidisch . . .”
dominated. A slightly modi"ed var. of this botanical term is attested in Cpt. (S)
maajeμppin (from *ms3r n p3 pnw) “mouse’s ear, myosotis” (CD 213a, 263a) =
“Vergißmeinnicht (wörtlich: ‘Mäuse-Ohr’)” (KHW 147).
nb3: K. Sethe (1899 I, §271) explained the loss of -š- < -s- in Cpt. (SAF) as assimila
tion (i.e., -s3- > *-š3- > *-33- > -3-), which is doubtful because is hardly accords with
the etymological evidence. P. Lacau (1910, 79), followed by W. C. Till (1928, §17.b),
ms!r 605



in turn, supposed -s- to have became -"- (on the analogy of -t-/-r- in similar cons.
cluster position), which was rightly doubted by H. J. Polotsky (l.c.), who suggested
that “die . . . Gruppe -vj- (= -vtv-) ist in den anderen Dialekten in der Weise vereinfacht
worden, daß eins ihrer beiden š dissimilatorischen Schwund ver!el”, i.e., in (L) the second -š
(i.e., that of -j- conceived as *-tv-), while in (SAF) the "rst -š- had been lost.
nb4: It has long been observed that most of the Cpt. re#exes cannot be directly
explained from old ms3r, which would yield rather, e.g., (B) *mavji, (F) *meeji
etc. The archetype *ms3« required by the Cpt. evidence has been identi"ed H. J.
Polotsky (1931, 76) with Dem. ms3« (ear det., hapax in Setna 4:30), whose earlier
form was found by J. ,erný (1950, 39, #5) in LEg. ms3« (written ms3r«3.t, ear det.,
XXI./XXII., hieratic list of body parts protected by a god, Pap. Berlin 10462, rt.
76:4). Cf. also Fecht 1960, 197 (with lit.); CED 100; Vcl. 1990, 197, §7; Osing 2000,
167. Although Polotsky did not know of parallels of the shift of r > « elsewhere, one
might compare perhaps the reverse process (OK « > MK r) attested presumably in
3 exx. (Peust 1999, 106, §3.6.4.4), one of which, namely the Eg. name of Nile, was
however, regarded by J. Kahl (1992, 102 & fn. 16) as an instance of old r > MK «.
He saw in PT (292dWT, 564aT, 2047cN) %p the defective wtg. of %rp (attested in the
MK), whence “könnte . . . ein Wandel %rpi > %«pi angesetzt werden und nicht – wie Kurt Sethe
[1910, 164] annahm – ein Wandel %«pi > %rpi”. At the same time, beside LEg. mšt( j)
yielding (P) mavta and (L) mevte, the LEg. var. *mš3(r) must have also survived
to yield (B) mavj. É. Drioton (1941, 124–5) analyzed a cryptographic pun for Eg.
ms3r (GR, Pap. Salt 825 = BM 10051, rt. 9:4) as a compound of ms (hrgl. of the
“vache qui vêle”) + 3r (hrgl. of leaf, cf. Eg. 3r3 “feuillage”). E. Edel (AÄG 109, §253)
derived (B) mavj ultimately from an old ms3 attested in his view already in PT
1673bMN (which he apparently did not consider to be just a defective wtg. contra Kahl
1992). Strangely, J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 45, 156) took (B) mavj directly (!) from *mís3ar.
! The validity of its inner Eg. derivation (no. 1) is beyond doubt. Or, at least, that the Sprachgefühl in ancient Egypt explained the word this way, can hardly be questioned. On the other hand, in the light of all presently available linguistic data, we may not fully exclude a more complicated scenario, where OK ms3r came into being as a secondary form due to the contamination (re-etymologization) of an inherited *ms3 “ear” (from an ancient AA nomen instr. literally signifying the “organ of hearing”) and the Neubildung ms3r “re"ned” from this inherited word (no longer felt to be native?) and s3r “to lie (on)” and accordingly extended by an additional -r in the prehistoric or archaic period when some other old anatomical terms (e.g., *«jn
“eye”, *jd “hand”, *jdn “ear”) were replaced by innovative names and when the pre"x m- was still in active use. " 1. Its derivation as the m- pre"x nomen loci form of Eg. s3r “die Nacht zubringen, schlafen, liegen” (PT, Wb IV 390–2) is widely accepted. The original sense of Eg. ms3r has been rendered as “la partie de la tête sur laquelle on s’appuie pour dormir” (Lacau) = “endroit où l’on dort” (Vcl.: “it is on the ear that one sleeps”) = “+0'*!, ") 2!*!/!+# '9:*” (Old.) = “l’endroit sur lequel on dort” (Vrg.) = “Stelle bzw. Vorrichtung zum Schlafen” > “Schläfe” (Osing) = “thing lain upon” (Smith) = “Schlafort” > “Schläfe” (Till: cf. Germ. leg dich aufs Ohr!

[AHW 1075] = “sich niederlegen” [GB] = “to sink to rest, lie motionless” [Driver
apud Lsl.] !! Hbr. )ll II qal “sinken” [GB 684] !! Geez )alala “to #oat upon, come to
the surface, swim” [Lsl. 1987, 555]. (2) O. Rössler (1966, 228; 1971, 306), in turn,
equated it – in the frames of his new system of cons. correspondences (Eg. 3 ~ Sem.
*«, Eg. r ~ Sem. *d) – with Hbr. s«d qal “stützen, befestigen, unterstützen, helfen”
[GB 548] = “to support, sustain, strengthen, help” [KB 761] (Rössler’s “ausruhen”
is unattested) !! Tigre s«d “Arm, Ellbogen, Nacken” [Rsl.], which is semantically less
likely. (3) Later, O. Rössler (1987, 384) combined it with Hbr. šq« qal “(ver-, zurück-,
nieder)sinken” [GB 861], which is even more dif"cult to follow. (4) V. Orel & O.
Stolbova (1992, 201) compared it with a certain CCh. *cVgur- (sic) “to sit” [OS]
probably “based” on Lamang ts0ur- “to sit” [Lks.] | Glavda 'a0war- ~ '0ur- “to
sit” [Rapp] | Muktele ‰áhàl “to sleep” [Rsg.] (CCh.: JI 1994, 295, 299).
" 2. The alternative comparison of Eg. ms3r with common Brb. *)mK-g “ear” [GT] is almost as old ("rst established by Rochemonteix) as its derivation from Eg. s3r and has been maintained also by many specialists. Accepting the Brb. parallel of Eg. ms3r, Ch. Rabin assumed the Eg. "nal -r to be an additional element that “occurs occasionally in HS as a suf!x, cf. Hbr. -l”. Rejected by A. Ju. Militarev (2005, 359, #21) for the sake of an evidently false etymology (below). If the underlying PBrb. root contained *-g (as supposed by Cohen, Brockelmann, Lacau, and Militarev, cf. below), the equation of the hypothetic pre-OEg. *ms3 (above) might be in principle explained with the shift of AA *ç/æ/*- + *g > Eg. s- + g > s- + 3 via loss of glottalization due to incompatibility (EDE I 327–9). Does the Eg.Brb. isogloss represent the nomen instr. of AA *æug- “to hear” [Mlt.] = *æ-g [GT]?

nb3: The etymological position of Brb. word for “ear” is very much disputed. The

608 ms!r



(1929, 45) compared it with NBrb.: Zwawa & Bugi â-zzug “sourd” < Brb. *)m-K-g
(sic) “être sourd”, for which cp. rather Eg. z4j “taub sein, taub machen” (MK, Wb
III 473–4). F. Nicolas (1953, 220) af"liated it with SBrb.: Taitoq s2g2d “dresser
l’oreille, écouter”. Surprisingly enough, V. Bla&ek (1994, 434) analyzed Brb. *-mazzu3
as an m- pre"x derivative of PAA *gy-0 [Blz.] (falsely deriving PBrb. *-zz- from
the palatalization of PAA *gy, for which he presented no evidence) and identi"ed it
with Sem.: Sqt. )0gy: mS 0&2-d-"ideh!n “lobe of ear” [SSL 1991, 1478]. But the
formal coincidence is misleading. There is great confusion in the lit. (listed at the
end of this NB) around a number of other external parallels suggested for Brb.
*)m-K-g (and sometimes also for Eg. ms3r), which are also rather dubious (mostly
on phonological grounds) and can hardly have anything to do with Eg. ms3r. This
linguistic material can be grouped as follows:
(1) Often (lit. below) equated with Bed. m3suw ~ m3su [Rn.: < *mesuhw, *mesuh]
“hören, vernehmen, aufmerksam sein” [Rn. 1895, 174; Rpr. 1928, 218] = m3s$
“to hear” [ Jean 1913, 84] = m3s$ ~ m3si(w) “to hear” [Rpr. 1928, 218] = mas$w
“to hear” [Hds. 1996, 96]. But Brb. *-z/K- + Bed. -s-. In principle, the hypothetic
Bed. *-h might correspond to Brb. *-3. It is, however, dubious whether Bed. -w
could derive from *-gw. M. Cohen (1947, #82) connected Brb. *)m-K-g “ear” and
Bed. )m-s-w with Eg. s3m “to hear” (apparently assuming development of Eg. s3m
< *ms3 < *msg), although Eg. s3m has been convincingly etymologized from *sm3
< *sm« ~ Sem. *šm« “to hear” (see EDE I 262).
(2) O. Rössler (1987, 384), followed by V. Bla&ek (1994 MS Bed., 28), connected the
Eg.-Brb. parallel with Bed. mišãkwi ~ mišakwãni (f ) “Schläfe” [Rn. 1895] = miš3kwi ~
šim3kwi ~ šim3kwani “temple” [Rpr. 1928]. But L. Reinisch (1895, 175, 215) related
the Bed. word with Eth.-Sem. *)mškw “to chew the cud, ruminate” [Blz.].
(3) Bed. )m-s-w has often been compared in Cu. studies (cf. e.g. Jean 1913, 84; Dlg.
1973, 301; Zbr. 1989, 583, #38) with the re#exes of Agaw *was- “to hear” [Apl.,
Dlg.] !!! NOm. *wayz- “ear” [Blz.] = *way‰- [Dlg.] (although no author succeeded
in explaining the function of Bed. m- as a pre"x in this case), which are, however,
most probably akin rather to Sem. *"u3n- “ear” [WUS 8, #89] !!! Eg. (*)jdn [irreg.
from *"‰n] “ear” (based on the phon. det. value jdn of the ear hrgl. contra Lacau

*manæ-a “ear” (cf. denom. *maææ-is- “to hear”) [Hds] = *maææ-a “ear” [GT]:
Hadiyya (Gudella) máææ-a ~ maææ-e [Mrn., PB] = maææ-ie [Crl.] = meæ-1 [Bnd.]=
maææ-e [Hds., Zbr.], Sidamo maææ-a [Mrn.; Hds.; Gsp. 1983, 217] = maææ-1 [Crl.]

nasal?) [Mrn.] = menša [Bnd.] = manš-a [Hds.] etc. “ear” (HECu.: Mrn. 1937,

1989, 55), which is also false. Bed. and Agaw *-s- + HECu. *-ææ-. The Cu./Om.
etymology of HECu. *maææ- is not settled. Following M. M. Moreno (1937, 237),
A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 183) erroneously derived the HECu. word from a PCu.
*À-"wVl- “ear”. Similarly, M. Lamberti (1987, 534, #16.b) saw in HECu. -ææ- the
palatalization of *-""w-. G. Hudson (1989, 417–418) set up HECu. *manæ-a “ear”
> *maææ-is- (denom.) “to hear”, but the *-næ- is not justi"ed suf"ciently (based on
Darasa only). The Eg.-HECu. comparison was rejected by A. Ju. Militarev (2005,
359, #21). Although the comparison of the HECu. word with Agaw *was- and Bed.
)m-s-w is evidently out of question on phonological grounds, its connection with
the hypothetic Eg.-Brb. *)m-æ-g is not necessarily to be ruled out a priori (HECu.
*maææ- assimilated < earlier *maæg-?).

the Brb. simplex. A. Ju. Militarev (in Sts. et al. 1995 MS, 6) referred to the eventual
common origin of Eg. ms3r, Brb. *)m-K-g, HECu. *maææ-a (amd mistakenly also
Bed. m-s-w) with ECh. *Seg- “to hear” [Mlt.] based on the isolated ECh.: Kwang
s1gí “to hear” [ Jng.], Kera Öskí “to hear” [Ebert] (ECh.: JI 1994 II, 185), which,
however, display no trace of AA *æ- ( JI 1994 I, 90 treat this ECh. root carefully
separated from PCh. *d2-gw “to hear”). Cf. also Takács (1999, 160, #2.3). Later,
A.Ju. Militarev (2005, 359, #21) equated the hypothetic Brb. root **)-K-g with ECu.
**e/og- “to hear” [Sasse 1979, 17] < AA *æug- [Mlt.], which seems phonologically
more convincing (AA *æ > Brb. *K has been demonstrated by G. Takács 2006,

literal sense has been rendered “la troupe en marche” > “le corps expéditionnaire” (Vcl.) = “Marschierendes” > “Expeditionstruppe, Heer” (Zeidler). Dubious. A reverse (denominal) way of derivation of Eg. mš«j seems more likely (provided there was an etymological con
nection at all). This comparison is hindered also by the unexplained anomaly of the Cpt. (SaAL) re#exes of Eg. mš« “troop” (-v-) vs.
mš«j “to march” (-H-) > Dem. m0« “gehen” (DG 170:1), which led
J. ,erný (CED 96) to assuming an original *m4«j in the latter case.

nb1: Some of the adherents of the Rössler theory (neuere Komparatistik) derived the
underlying root from pre-Eg. *mšd preserved in Dem. mšd “durchwandern” (which,
acc. to J. Zeidler, “nicht mehr aufgrund einer phonetischen Variation aus . . . mš«j abgeleitet
werden konnte”) treated as the Wurzeldublette of mš«j (for further details and lit. see
Zeidler 1992, 208; 1998, 26, fn. 30; Loprieno 1995, 45). Although mš«j (as verb)
is attested from the NK only, this hypothesis would imply that mš«j existed “schon
in der Zeit, als der «/9-Wechsel möglich war” (Zeidler). However, both J. Osing (1997,
229) and H. Satzinger (1999, 147) rightly viewed that this theory “semantically can
not be accepted ”, since NK mš«j derives from OK mš« “army” (as suggested also by
H. Goedicke 1998, 108).
nb2: There is, nevertheless, a weak external support for Eg. mš« ~ mš«j in the frames
of the “old school” of Eg.-Sem. cons. correspondences. In principle (pace Takács
2006, 113), we might regard Ar. mal«- “troupe, bande, partie” vs. mala«a “marcher
avec rapidité, d’un pas léger et rapide (se dit d’une chamelle)” [BK II 1149] as a
parallel displaying an interchange of the PSem. laterals (*-l- ~ *-G- > Ar. -l- ~ -š-),
cf. Ar. maša«a “3. marcher doucement” [BK II 1111].
" 2. H. Goedicke (1998, 109–110), in turn, noted some early (Dyn. IV and early Dyn. V) instances of mr-mš« written phonetically as
mr-š« (for lit. cf. l.c., fn. 38–40), whence he assumed that the root
“š« oder mš« zu lesen ist, wobei die Varianz darauf hindeutet, daß mš« eine
erweiterte Form ist ” (although he noted that “ob diese als m- Prä!x oder als *imj zu verstehen ist, läßt sich nicht entscheiden”). Goedicke offered various (often far-fetched) derivations from diverse Eg. roots )š«( j), neither of
which can, however, be regarded as convincing. Thus, one can agree with his own statement that “die etymologische Ableitung von m š« nicht mit
Sicherheit geklärt werden kann”.
nb: First, Goedicke considered “eine Verbindung mit š« ‘Sand’ ” that “könnte in Form einer
Nisbe-Bildung (š«j) oder als *imj-š« erfolgen, wobei ersteres als ‘der zum Sand gehörige’, letzteres
als ‘der im Sand be!ndliche’ übertragen werden müßte”, but confessed “weder das eine noch das
andere führt zu einer sinnvollen Bedeutung als Personenbezeichnung”. Alternatively, he suggested
that “es scheint besser š« mit dem Verbum š« (sic) ‘abschneiden’ . . . zu verbinden”, whereby he
admitted “verschiedene Deutungen”: (1) lit. “Abschneider”, which – as Goedicke confessed
– “macht wenig Sinn (wenn man an Bogenschützen denkt)”; (2) “als nominal gebrauchtes passives
Partizip wäre die Übersetzung ‘Abgeschnittener’ angebracht, was räumlich und persönlich verstanden
werden kann. Im ersten Fall wäre es ein Verweis auf die Trennung vom angestammten Wohnort,
im anderen ein Einschnitt am Körper des Bezeichneten. Es gibt keinerlei Unterstützung für die erste
Möglichkeit. . . . Die Möglichkeit des körperlichen ‘Einschnitts’ scheint auf einen Punkt beschränkt,
nämlich die Beschneidung derer, die im ägyptischen Militärdienst standen, wobei dies auch auf
Personen nichtäg. Herkunft zutrifft”, whence Goedicke concluded that eventually, “wären
die als *š«, bzw. mš« bezeichneten Bogenkämpfer als ‘Beschnittene’ zu sehen”.
" 3. GT: hypothetically, interpreting Eg. mš« as a coll. noun “men,
people (of war)” deriving from an original sg. meaning “man (vir)”, a comparison with AA *m-S-(?) “male person (vir)” [GT] might be taken into account, although the nature of the underlying sibilant and the reconstruction of its C3 (if there was any) is fully uncertain.
Thus, this weak alternative has to laid aside for further research.

nb3: The etymology of the Eth.-Sem. root is disputed. F. Praetorius (1879, 509),
followed by W. Leslau (1963, 114; 1979, 426) and D. Appleyard (1977, 10/52),
postulated in Eth.-Sem. a development m2s < *b2s < *b2"2s based on Geez b2"(2)si
“man”, Tigre b2"2s “husband”. C.F.A. Dillmann (1865, 519) explained Geez b2"2si
“man” from the basic meaning “to be strong” (cf. Ar. ba"usa, Appleyard: Sem. *b"š
“to be bad” > “strong”). In M. Cohen’s (1939, 421) view, Eth.-Sem. *m- < *b- was
due to an interference in#uenced by Geez m2t “husband”. In this case, Eth.-Sem.
“husband” cannot be related with WCh. “vir” and Eg. “Heer”. On the other hand,
A. Ju. Militatev (2006 MS, 36, #51.10) combined the ES word rather with Ug. m2
“infante” [DLU 309], which is semantically unconvincing.
nb4: JS (1981, 147A1, 202A4) erroneously af"liated Ch. *m-z with a number of
synonymous Ch. roots (*m-t-(N), *m-n, *m-m, *m-r) on a monoradical basis (PCh.

nb1: W. Westendorf (KHW) surmised behind the Cpt. re#exes a late root *m«šj or
*m«š« < mš«j. His supposition has been con"rmed by H.W. Fischer-Elfert (1986,
174), who found a “hybride Graphie” in Pap. Anastasi I 22:1 showing the met. m«šj

nb2: J. ,erný (CED 96) assumed the Cpt. (SaAL) re#exes with -H- to “point to” an
original *-4- in the original root, but this is false. The correspondence of (SFB) -v
vs. (L) -H- clearly indicates Eg. -0-, since (SFB) -v- can only represent the regular
re#ex of old -š-/-0- (cf. Peust 1999, 115, §3.8.1). In addition, as rightly noted by
W. Vycichl (DELC), the strange (A) re#ex with -H- is certainly irregular, since old -4/0
yield (A) -G-. W. C. Till (1955, 334, §56) quoted Cpt. (AL) maaGe (sic, with -G-!), while
J. Osing (1978, 187) too gave a certain (A) maGe (so, -G-), but these forms have not
been listed in the standard lexicons. The controversy could be resolved, at least, to
a certain degree, by assuming a (L) in#uence in the (A) re#ex, although in this case
we should stick to an old *m0« (as in Dem.), which should be explained as the var.
of the unattested old *m4«j. Alternatively, (SBF) -v- might be perhaps due to an
early (pre-Cpt.) in#uence of Cpt. (SALMB) ve, (F) vi “gehen” (KHW 301).
! Etymology highly disputable.

nb1: Although Yeivin too accepted that NK mš«j “may be of course denom.”, he sur
prisingly viewed that “this fact would not affect the suggested connection between” Eg. mš«
and Ar. mšy.
nb2: The Sem. etymology of Ar. mšy is uncertain. J. Aistleitner (WUS #1610)
equated it with Ug. msw D “überbringen, melden” (not listed in DUL). M. Cohen
(1947, #473), in turn combined Ar. mšy with Eg. šm “to go” with met., which seems
more convincing. GT: cf. also WCh.: Tangale mêsê [-s- < *-G-?] “journey, travel,

" 4. Some of the adherents of the Rössler theory (neuere Komparatistik), e.g., J. Zeidler (1992, 208; 1998, 26 & fn. 30 with further lit.) and A. Loprieno (1994, 127; 1995, 45), rejecting the derivation of LEg. mš«j from OK mš« as denominal verb (suggesting instead a nomen
agentis in old mš« “army”), derived it from proto-Eg. *mšd preserved
in Dem. mšd “durchwandern” (not in DG, cf. below) treated as the etymological doublet (Wurzeldublette) of LEg. mš«j, i.e., as the Nebe
nentwicklung < PEg. *mš9, which “nicht mehr aufgrund einer phonetischen Variation aus . . . mš«j abgeleitet werden konnte” (Zeidler). Although the verb
mš«j is attested from the NK only, this hypothesis would imply that
it existed “schon in der Zeit, als der «/9-Wechsel möglich war” (Zeidler).
Moreover, as rightly pointed out both by J. Osing (1997, 229) and H. Satzinger (1999, 147), the comparison with Dem. mšd “semantically cannot be accepted ”.
nb: Besides, Dem. mšt seems to be a denom. verb from Eg. mšd.t “die Furt (des
Orontes)” (XVIII., Wb, below), which is, in turn, a nomen loci of PEg. *šd identi"ed
by A. G. Belova (1989, 15) with Sem.: Hbr. G99 “to wander, roam”, Ar. ša99-/ša9"
“shore, coast, river-bank”.
" 5. G. Takács (2006, 113): perhaps akin to Ar. maša«a “3. marcher

be conceived as a parallel displaying an interchange of the PSem.

nb1: For a detailed discussion of the mšwš cf. Wainwright 1962, 89–99 (stating on
p. 92, i.a., that “the main body of the tribe only differed from the Libu in not being tattooed . . . and
in their fashion of wearing the phallus-sheath instead of the kilt which is the dress of the Libu”)
and Zibelius 1972, 130–2.
nb2: The var. mšw is attested under Ramses III (LD III 218c). In G. A. Wainwright’s
(1961, 72 & fn. 5; 1962, 99) view, the "nal -š (GW) “of the full name was not an integral
part of the name but only a termination as in the names of the Sea Peoples” like Qereqeš,
Eqweš, Tereš, Šekeleš. K. Zibelius (1972, 130) too was of the speculative opinion
that “der frühe Abfall des -š könnte zeigen, daß es nicht zur Wurzel gehörte”.
nb3: The supposed "rst occurence of mšw in Thotmes’ III list of northern peoples
(Urk. IV 792, no. 282) is problematic. It was considered by W. Hölscher (1955, 60)
as “perhaps the original and more corrrect form”, which both W. C. Hayes ( JNES 10,
1951, 91, fn. 119) and K. Zibelius (1972, 131) rejected (cf. already AEO I 119*,
#240). Also for G. A. Wainwright (1962, 99, fn. 5), it was “hard to see in it more than
a coincidence in view of time and place” but he “cannot have been derived from the Asiatic
tribes”, because the form mšwš was in use already in the 34th year of Amenhotep
III (15 jars labelled containing “fat of mšwš bulls”).

! Etymology uncertain. A number of scholars suggest that Eg. mšwš might reflect the PBrb. ethnonym *a-mazi3 “Berber man”, pl. *i-mazi3-2n “Berber people”, *ta-mazi3-t “Berber language” [Mlt.], which is supposed to have been preserved also in Gk. D5*#!7 (Herodot) ~ D)i&$!7 (Ptolemy) ~ D5i#!7 (Hecataeus) and Lat. Mazices (Aethicus, Euagrius, Nicephorus Callistus, Philostorgius, Ammianus Marcellinus) ~ Mazaces and Mazages (Claudian, Lucan,

In principle, as rightly stated by A. Ju. Militarev (1991 and 1991 l.c.), Brb. *-mazi3 could originate from an older *-maGi0, while Eg. mšwš might perhaps stem from *mšw0 via assim. But in fact, no convincing Brb. etymological evidence has been adduced for this theory in this case. K.-G. Prasse (1959, 200) ex cathedra declined equating Brb. *-mazi3 with Eg. mšwš (without further comment). There is good reason to agree with him.

[Sarnelli] = *a-ma-zwi3 [Mlt.]. This etymology, however, certainly excludes any
comparison with Eg. mšwš, which would be plausible only if Brb. *-z- < AA *-G-.
But this is not the case, since Brb. *z-w-3 is cognate with NOm. *zo"- “red” [Bnd.]
(as pointed out by Takács 2000, 268–9). Surprisingly, Sarnelli assumed a reverse
chain of phonological shifts: *m-z-w-3 < *m-z-g-3 < (!) PBrb. *)z-g-3 (!) “red” with
*-g- > *-w- > -Ø-.
mšwš ~ mšw ~ mš ~ m 625



(3) K.-G. Prasse (1959, 197–200) disapproved this argumention on morphological
grounds. He treated PBrb. *a-m3zi3 as a nomen agentis (with pre"x *ma-) of a tr.
verb with an initial weak consonant, which he (following Foucauld 1951–2, 665–674)
was inclined to identify with SBrb.: Hgr. a-he3 “razzier” [Fcd.] and to derive it from
an earlier *aze3. Thus, acc. to Prasse, Hgr. a-m3ha3 could have act. meant “qui
razie” > “un (beau) guerrier” and thence (since only free men could participate
in war) “un homme libre” > “un noble”. This is certainly mistaken. Later, Prasse
(1969, 80, #520; 1972, 9, fn. 4) himself declined this idea. As later Prasse (1972, 9,
fn. 4) also admitted and con"rmed, the h- of Hgr. a-he3 “razzier” is original (i.e.,
not from *z-), cf. NBrb.: Shilh a3 “prendre, atteindre” [ Jordan 1934, 21] | Qabyle
a3 “prendre” [Dlt. 1982, 597], Ait Khalfun a3 [Bst.] !! WBrb.: Zenaga yokka (aor.)
[Bst.] etc. (Brb.: Bst. 1885, 190) !!! NAgaw: Hamir h5q “stehlen, entwenden” [Rn.
1884, 370]. Note that E. Zyhlarz (1934, 118) and P. Behrens (n.d. MS) combined
SBrb.: Hgr. a-he3 vs. Hamir h5q, resp., with Eg. %3q “erbeuten, erobern” (MK,
Wb III 32–33), which has a fully different etymology (see Ember 1911, 88; 1917,
88, fn. 2; 1926, 302, fn. 10; 1930, #3.c.4; Holma 1919, 40; Lexa 1938, 217; Vrg.
1945, 130, #1.d.19; Chn. 1947, #442).
(4) Strangely, K. Zibelius (1972, 131) explained the Brb. word from Gk. and Lat.
(and not vice versa).
(5) It may well be that Brb. *-mazi3 cannot be explained purely on Brb. grounds.
Already O. Bates (1914, 42) surmised that this term “radically once was a common
ethnic name of Western Hamites”, which O. Rössler (1964, 205) suspected to represent
an ethnonym going back to the common AA heritage shared with LECu.: Somali
mudug [-d- reg. < ECu. *-z-] “Selbstbezeichnung eines Teiles der Somali” and
CCh.: Logone muzugu “Volk in Kamerun”.

! An m- pre"x form (as surmised already by H. Grapow 1914, 31) derived by J. Osing (NBÄ 743, n. 899), W. Vycichl (DELC 129), Ch. Cannuyer (1986, 98–99), and Th. Bardinet (1988, 23) from Eg. *špn attested in špn “eine Krankheit” (Med. hapax: Pap. Hearst 171–2, Wb IV 444, 15) = “Gonorrhoe” (Ebbell 1938, 49) = “eine Krankheit: eine schmerzhafte Harnerkränkung” (WMT 845 contra Ebbell) = “Auftreibung, Stauung” (NBÄ 744, n. 899) = “un engraissement inhabituel, accompagné de rétention” (Cannuyer after Osing) = “maladie: blennorragie” (Bardinet l.c.).
nb1: J. Osing (NBÄ 206, 742–4, n. 899) eventually explained Eg. *špn “ausgebaucht,
aufgetrieben sein” as a var. to Eg. 4pn ~ (later) 0pn “fett, gemästet” (Wb III 366,
12–14) = “wohlgenährt sein, werden” (Osing) = “feist, stramm, kraftstrotzend,

290, not in CD) = “sicher sein (?)” or rather “fett, fruchtbar” (KHW 382, 567) =
“gras. engraissé, gavé” (Cannuyer) with an old interchange of 4 ~ š (Sethe 1899 I,
§260–2; AÄG §120; ÜKAPT V 295), which is dubious with regard to the anoma
lous Cpt. re#exes: (A) mavpwne etc. (clearly pointing to an old -š-) vs. (L) Hpan
(indicating old 4-).
nb2: Ch. Cannuyer (l.c.) extended this comparison with Eg. špn.t “gute Eigenschaft
einer Frau” (Lit. MK: Ptahhotep 500, 503, Wb IV 444, 16) = “eine Wohlgenährte”
(Erman 1923, 95, n. 37) = “une femme atteinte de maladie (vénérienne?)” (Lexa).
The connection with Eg. 4pn was rightly rejected by Z. Bába (1956, 160, n. 499
following F. Lexa), at least, in the case of špn in Ptahhotep l.c. (“špn des papyrus
médicaux n’a rien de commun . . . avec notre mot”).

mšr.w 627



nb1: As stated by E. Hornung (1961, 109–111, §3), the PT det. of sunrays (replaced
from MK by that of the darkness) “weist daraufhin, daß mšrw ursprünglich eine Tageszeit
war, die noch nicht völlig dunkel ist, in der vielmehr die Sonne selbst oder zumindest das Abendrot
noch ‘strahlt’. Mehrfach erscheint mšrw . . . eindeutig als Zeit der Sonnenuntergangs”. P. Wilson
(PL 470) too viewed that the OK det. of sunrays of mšr.w “implies that it is the time
when the light has not quite gone, but perhaps the sky is red with ‘!re’ . . .”.
nb2: P. Lacau (1972, 58, §26.6) surmised in its "nal -w a noun suf"x “de noms de
divisions du temps” (!).
! Hence: (1) mšr.wt “Essen zur mšr.w-Zeit” (PT, Wb II 158, 1) = “evening-meal” (FD 119) = “main meal (- dinner), which is served either at midday or in the evening, the roast-meal” (Gdk. 1970, 140, 201, n. 176) = “Mahlzeit am frühen Nachmittag” (Helck, LÄ III 1164), (2) denom. mšr “am Abend sein” (GR, Wb II 158, 3) > (3) caus. smšr “den Abend zubringen” (XXVI., Wb IV 144, 1).
nb: The rendering of mšr in PT 1048d is disputed. R.O. Faulkner (AEPT 174, utt.
488) apparently took it to be the denom. of mšr.w (lit. “to be in the evening”), while
E. Hornung (1961, 110) and P. Wilson (PL 470) identi"ed it with mšr “verglühen
(Natron)” (1st IMP hapax, Hornung 1961, 110; GHWb 368; ÄWb I 570) = “to be
burnt, dry by "re” (PL). Whether the latter is indeed also a denom. verb from mšr.
w is, however, rather uncertain. If mšr “verglühen” represents a distinct root, cf.
perhaps alternatively Ar. mašira I “2. être vif, ardent”, V “2. être vert vif (feuillage),
2. avoir toute l’apparence d’aisance” [BK II 1109]?
! There have been suggested several tempting etymologies. Most attractive seem solutions #2 and #4 (eventually, perhaps from the same AA root with met.?). " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 31) assumed in Eg. mšrw an m- pre"x form (without naming its simplex). This derivation has become common in Eg. philology, albeit in diverse (sometimes controversial) forms. There is no agreement even in the basic sense of the underlying root. Semantically, neither of the proposed inner Eg. etymologies can be regarded as satisfactory.
nb1: G. Fecht (ZÄS 85, 1960, 105, fn. 1) derived it from a hypothetic Eg. *šr
“1. gelbrot, #ammenfarben, 2. heiß, dörrend” based on the unconvincing comparison
of 3šr “braten”, wšr and sšr (caus.) “trocknen”, šr.t “Kleid”, šr% “Name einer Art
Holz (von roter Farbe)”, dšr “rot” (quoted after Wb), which seem to display at least
four etymologically distinct roots (although a remote connection of Eg. 3šr and wšr
has been surmised also by A. Ember 1930, §19.a.11 and A. G. Belova 1989, 15):
(1) for Eg. 3šr see Hodge 1990, 647, #17.B; OS 1992, 197; HSED #573; Orel
1995, 102, #35. (2) For Eg. wšr cf. Ember 1930, §19.a.12; Dlg. 1970, 622, #8.46;
1989, 96, #33; OS 1992, 200; HSED #564. (3) For Eg. šr.t cf. perhaps OS 1989,
88; 1992, 174; HSED #2331. (4) Eg. šr% (GR) seems to be a foreign word, (5) The
origin of Eg. dšr is obscure as no convincing etymology has been proposed as yet.
In any case, it can hardly be related either with Sem. *Gr= “to be red” (contra Alb.
1918, 234, 235; Ember 1930, §19.a.9) or Sem. *)%r “rötlich sein” (as in Snd. 1997,
208, #113). Note that Eg. d- agrees neither with Sem. *-= nor with *)-. The idea
of L. Bender (1975, 181) on an eventual connection with CCh. *d-z “red” has to
be subject to further research.
nb2: E. Hornung (1961, 109–111, §3), maintaining that mšr.w “ist . . . die Zeit, in
welcher die Sonne ‘verglüht’ (untergeht)”, explained it from Eg. mšr “verglühen (Sonne,
628 mšr.w



Natron)” and ultimately from 3šr “braten (Fleisch), rösten (Feigen), backen (Brot)”
(PT, Wb I 21, 4–6). A similar position has been taken by P. Wilson (PL 470) who
derived mšr.w from *šr “to be dry, roast” concluding that it was “time of day when
the sun is ‘burnt up’ . . .”. Hornung found E. Otto’s (1954, 50) biconsonantal Eg. *šr
“trocken” as erroneous. Instead, Hornung (1961, 110, fn. 1) falsely assumed an
eventual connection with the Grundbedeutung “verringern (was beim Trocknen, Rösten
usw. eintritt)” (sic!) with a hint to Eg. šrr ~ šrj “klein sein” (OK, Wb IV 524), which
represents in fact a distinct AA root, cf. Ember 1912, 90; 1930, #12.a.40; Holma
1919, 45; Alb. 1927, #64; Chn. 1947, #293; Gordon 1955, 339, #2080; Zvd. 1967,
22; MM 1983, 230; Bynon 1984, 274–275, #36; EDE I 140.
nb3: H. Goedicke (1970, 140), ignoring its clearly secondary derivation from Eg.
mšr.w, explained mšr.wt “Bezeichnung der Mahlzeit” directly (!) from Eg. 3šr (above)
concluding that it was “die Hauptmahlzeit des Tages, die sich durch ‘a roast as its pièce de
résistance’ auszeichne” (Verhoeven 1984, 16), which was rightly doubted by W. Helck
(LÄ III 1165, n. 3).
" 2. F. Behnk (1927, 82, #14), F. von Calice (1936, #418), and W. Vycichl (1990, 222) equated it with Sem.: JAram. r2maš ~ ramš3 ~ ru/$mš3 “Abend” [Dalman 1922, 405; Levy 1924 IV, 456] = “evening” [ Jastrow 1950, 1483], Syr. ramš3 (sg.), ramše ~ ramšaw3t3 (pl.) “vesper” [Brk. 1928, 735b-736a] with met., although Aram. -š- does not regularly correspond to Eg. -š- (while Eg. -š- = Aram. -s- < Sem. *-G-). This etymology was rejected already by W. F. Albright (1927, 202) because of the Aram. sibilant.
nb: The Aram. word has no evident Sem. cognates (this fact has been con"rmed
by M. Moriggi, p.c., 20 Feb. 2007). C. Brockelmann (l.c.) supposed a connection
with Ar. )rms: "ar-raw3misu “1. ceux qui (se) cachent, 2. vents qui en dispersant
la poussière couvrent et effacent les traces des pas ou d’un campement, 3. oiseaux
nocturnes, ou, en gén., bêtes qui ne sortent que pendant la nuit” [BK II 924] =
“animalia noctu prodeuntia” [Brk.]. J. Levy’s (l.c.) analysis (root ext. r- + )mšš, lit.
“weichen, von der Sonne, die sich entfernt hat”) is, in turn, very unlikely. Perhaps
SCu.: Asa eramesa “night” [Ehret 1980, 387] is related, but cp. SCu.: PRift *amas
“night” [Ehret] (discussed in detail s.v. Eg. msw.t, above).
" 3. W. F. Albright (1927, 202) compared Eg. mšr.w with Ar. samara “1. passer la nuit à causer, deviser pendant la nuit, 2. veiller”, samira ~ samura “être brun, foncé, de couleur fauve foncée”, samar- “1. entretien, causerie de nuit, 2. nuit, 3. ténèbres, 4. endroit où il y a de l’ombre par un clair de lune, 5. temps, 6. endroit où l’on cause pendant la nuit” [BK II 1135–6] = samara “to be awake, not to sleep, occupy oneself during the night, pasture animals by night” [Lane 1424] = samar- “evening vigil, night, night darkness”, samura “to be dark, brown” [Alb.], although Ar. s- is just as an irregular match of Eg. -š- as Aram. -š-. In addition, the primary sense of the underlying Sem. root is quite different.
nb: Cf. Hbr. šmr “1. to keep, watch over, 2. take care of, preserve, protect” [KB
1581–2], Phn. & Punic šmr “to guard, watch over” [Donner-Röllig] | OSA 3mr
“to protect” [Conti, SD 39] etc.
mšr.w 629



" 4. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 173) supposed Eg. mšr.w to be cognate with NOm.: Wolayta cluster *omars-a “night, evening” [Bnd.].
nb1: Attested in Wlt. omarsa “evening” [LS] = "omársa [Alm., Azeb], Dorze
(Gerese?) & Gofa omarsa “evening, night” [Bnd.], Gofa "umarsa “night” [Alm.],
Dawro omarsa “evening” [Lmb.], Gamu omarsí “evening, night” [Lmb. 1985

2000 MS, 60, #95).
nb2: The Cu.-Om. etymology of this stem has been disputed, albeit no convincing
parallels have be proposed. A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 142) derived the Dache form
from his PCu. *«Vm(V)S- “1. evening, 2. darkness, 3. night etc.” (based on exx. with
no trace of *-r- re#ecting evidently diverse etyma), while M. Lamberti and R. Sottile
(1997, 287) postulated POm. *"om-ar- (with *-s- explained as “sibilant derivational
suf"x”, sic) derived from a certain OCu. (PCu.-Om.) *kwab-(ar)- (!) “time of darkness,
night” (with a shift *kw- > *"- and *-b- > -m-). Both suggestions are baseless.
nb3: Does the hypothetic Aram.-Eg.-Wlt. isogloss eventually originate from AA
*m-S-r ~ *m-r-S (its sibilant C3 cannot be exactly de"ned) “black” [GT] > NAgaw

! Other suggestions are evidently out of question: " 5. L. Reinisch (1887, 275): ~ NAgaw: Bilin mizÉ “Abend” (for which cf. Eg. msw.t above). " 6. O. Bates (1914, 83): ~ Brb. *)m-d-r > NBrb.: Mnsr. 2a-madir-2 “evening”, but Eg. -š- + Brb. *-d-. " 7. E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 173, 180) assumed in it a pre"x m- and compared Eg. *š with Nub. *šare “Abend” [BG 1984–85, 53].
nb: PNub. *šare “Abend” cannot be anyhow cognate. It might be, however, notewor
thy as a plausible AP to the AA root preserved by Eg. šs3.t [reg. < *šsr.t] “Nacht”

200; HSED #2261.
" 8. K.-G. Prasse (PAM 2003, 624) erroneously combined it with Sem. *msw/y (sic!) and PBrb. *--nsih “passer la nuit”, which are, in fact, akin to Eg. msw.t (above). " 9. GT: the connection with Yemeni Ar. našar “am Spätnachmittag gehen” [Deboo 1989, 197] = “to depart, go, set off, leave” [Piamenta 1990, 485] (with an alternation of m- ~ n-) is improbable.
nb: The basic sense of this Ar. root is signi"cantly different, cf. Ar. nšr “déployer
(les voiles), ouvrir et étaler, disperser, disséminer, divulguer, publier, répandre (des
connaissances), enseigner” [BK II 1258; Dozy II 671].
mšr.w (GW) “some damp or waterlogged place (?)” (late NK, Grd. 1948 II, 32) = “?” (AC 1977, 9 after Grd.) = “une catégorie de terres (?)” (AL 77.1894; 78.1879) = “une désignation de pièce d’eau” (Kruchten

of Edfu V 56:6 that J. F. Borghouts (l.c.) surmised to have signi"ed “the realm of

(hymn) and Pap. Jumilhac 21:10 (“both in a most aquatic context”).
! Mng. and etymology obscure. " 1. A. H. Gardiner (1948 II, 32) found its occasional det. of night/ darkness (occuring in Pap. Wilbour B17:8.28) to resemble Eg. mšr.w “afternoon, early evening” remarking that “that possible etymology (!) provides no apparent clue to the meaning”. Of course, there can be no etymological connection (which, besides, Gardiner missed to specify). " 2. J.-M. Kruchten (1978, 25), followed by D. Meeks (AL l.c.; 1997, 42, #207): “pourrait bien . . . n’être qu’une variante de ce même mot”, i.e., Eg. jšr.w “Tempel und heiliger See der Göttin Mut bei Karnak” (XVIII.-GR, Wb II 135, 6) = “un étang résiduel en demi-lune, voisin du désert, formé soit par les pluies d’orage à la base du cône de déjection d’un oued, soit par un méandre du #euve en voie d’assèchement” (Kruchten 1978, 25 afrer Sauneron 1964 and Yoyotte 1962) = “désignation du lac des déesses lionnes” (Meeks) = “1. name of a canal in the 18th LEg. nome, 2. also the name of the lake of Mut, the lioness goddess” (PL 113) “constituée au moyen de la particule préformante «m» qui . . . sert à construire notamment des noms d’instruments et des noms de lieux”. Kruchten assumed that both Eg. jšr.w and mšr.w “pourraient . . . être . . . synonymes et correspondaient peut-être . . . à des variantes dialectales”. Although this idea was accepted by P. Wilson (PL 470) and R. Woodhouse (2003, 279, #207), it appears to be rather poorly argued.
nb: More far-fetched and unlikely is Kruchten’s (1978, 27–28) further theory that Eg.
mšr.w “crépuscule” (above) might “fort bien d’ailleurs avoir la même origine: après désigné
simplement une variété de pièce d’eau, le même mot se serait appliqué au moment particulier de
la journée où ce lieu prenait une importance exceptionnelle aux yeux des Égyptiens préhistoriques,
à l’heure où, le soleil juste couché, cet endroit désert aux heures chaudes, s’animait pour devenir le
siège d’une vie animale intense”.
" 3. J. Hoch (1994, 158–9, §207) assumed it to have “possibly” derived from an m- pre"x re#ex of Sem. *w2r (sic!) ~ *yšr “to be level” [Hoch] like JAram. m1š3r ~ m1š3r3 “1. Ebene, Fläche, 2. Beet” [Dalman 1922, 235] = “Plan, Ebene” [Levy 1924 III 290] = (m) “straight line, horizontal level (dividing, e.g., a "eld)” vs. (f ) “1. bed, 2. plain, valley” [ Jastrow 1950, 779] = “garden bed, plain” [Hoch]. Cf. perhaps also Akk. m$šaru ~ muš/sar(r)û “Beet” [AHW 681: < eš1ru?] = m/$šar$ (pl.t.) “(a technical term for planting a
mšr.w 631



"eld)” [CAD m2, 262]. Rejected by D. Meeks (1997, 42, #207) and R. Woodhouse (2003, 279, #207).
nb1: Hoch’s PSem. *w2r (sic!) “to be level” is a grave error, since the Aram. and Ar.
re#exes clearly indicate Sem. *yšr “(to be) straight” (cf. GB 326; Dlg. 1983, 137,
#10.2; 1990, 213). His comparison with OSA (Sab.) "w2r “low ground (?), terre
basse (?)” [SD 166] = “plains, lowlands” [Hoch] is baseless.
nb2: Alternatively, Hoch combined Eg. mšr.w with Sem. *2rw “to be moist” (OHbr.
*mišr3, st.cstr. mišrat- “liquid”, MHbr. mišr3 “pond”, TAram. mitr$t3 “juice”, Ar.
2aran “moist earth, ground, soil”), but since the Can. evidence “points to extreme wet
ness, not appropriate for land producing cereal crops”, Hoch regarded this connection as
“somewhat questionable”.
" 4. GT: a relationship with Brb. *ta-mazi/ar-t “sort of "eld, land” [GT] seems not to be excluded on both semantical and phonological grounds (Eg. -š- ~ Brb. *-z- < AA *-G-).

nb2: The inner Brb. etymology of the Brb. word has been subject to strong debates.
(1) V. Loubignac (l.c.) derived it from a certain Brb. *a-zr (unattested). (2) E. Laoust
(1942, 82, §248), assuming that “c’est le nom donné à un ’ancien campement’ encombré de
détritus, puis celui du ‘fumier’ qui s’y trouve accumulé”, linked it to Shilh a-mazir “fumier”
[Lst.], cf. Mzg. a-mazir, pl. i-mizar “lieu de campement, tas de fumier” [Abès 1916,
110]. (3) Ch. de Foucauld (l.c.), in turn, listed it s.v. Hgr. a-her “mettre en associa
tion (être associé pour), avoir en commun” [o.c., p. 634], which was rightly rejected
by (4) K.-G. Prasse (1969, 80, #522), who supposed that our word might perhaps
originate from Brb./Tuareg *i-zar “précéder”.
" 5. GT: or, with regard to the occasional plant det. of Eg. mšr.w, cf. perhaps OSA: Qtb. mGr “plants, sprouts” [Ricks 1982 MS, 145–6], Ar. mašara I “produire ou avoir des feuilles appelées mašr-at-”, IV “2. produire des plantes, des herbes, se couvrir de végétation (se dit du sol)”, mašr-at- “1. feuille d’une plante ou d’un arbre dès qu’elle commence à s’ouvrir et quand elle est encore de forme oblongue et pontue, 2. rameau tendre et verte”, cf. m3šir-at- “champ gai dont les récoltes luxuriantes se balancent au vent” [BK II 1109–1110] = mašr-at- “sprouts, vegetables” [Ricks]?

! Etymology uncertain. Apparently a loan-word, but neither of the suggested Sem. etyma can be regarded as "tting. " 1. W. Helck (l.c.) explained it (“wohl ”) from Hbr. *šrr “winden” (sic) [Helck] = “be strong, linked (?)” [Hoch], but this is unattested and has no m- pre"x derivative in the OT (cf. GB 864; KB 1658). J. J. Janssen (l.c.) rightly expressed his doubt (“I fail to see to what kind of furniture this could point ”). Declined by J. Hoch (l.c.) as “unfounded”.
" 2. J. J. Janssen (1975, 195) too supposed a borrowing from Can., cf. Hbr. m5š.r “level place, plateau, plain” < yšr “straight, smooth”. But this is similarly baseless. As J. Hoch (l.c.) has emphasized, there is “no evidence in Sem. for a word designating an item of furniture” from this root. " 3. J. Hoch (1994, 157–8, §206) identi"ed it with the Sem. word for “table” having an anomalous *p- (Akk. paššuru, IAram. ptwr",
JAram. p3t.r(t)3, Ar. f32$r-), which is phonologically unconvincing.

! Mng. debated. Etymology uncertain. Already A. H. Gardiner (l.c.) surmised that it “looks like a Sem. pass. part. *mašr$r”, although the Sem. “word ” it might have originated from was for him “unknown”. " 1. J. Lauth (1871, 635, §140) mistranslated it as “ein Wagenteil, der eingeölt werden mußte: Axe (?)” and assumed a connection either with Hbr. m5š.r “Geradheit” or m2sill3 “Bahn”. " 2. W. Helck (l.c.) tried to explain it from Hbr. šrr “winden” (sic), but failed to demonstrate this comparison. " 3. J. Hoch (1994, 159–160, §208), followed by G. del Olmo Lete & J. Sanmartín (DUL 594), set up a vocalized form *mašarrira stating that “it seems almost certain that there is a connection with” Sem. *šrr “to be "rm”, whereby it “is no doubt a D-stem participle” like Ug. mšrr-m (pl.) “stabilizers, carats (small weights used to balance the scales)” [Dijkstra & de Moor, UF 7, 1975, 205] = “pointer (of the balance), pivot” [DUL with further lit.].
mšš.wt “eine Krankheit” (Med.: Pap.

nb: Th. Bardinet (l.c.) and R. Hannig (GHWb) identi"ed it with LEg. mšt (GW)
“*Krätze, *Haarausfall” (GHWb, below), which seems rather unlikely as correctly
remarked already by W. Westendorf (HAM 143, fn. 78: “. . . wohl kaum mit dem
maskulinen mšt . . . vergleichbar”). In the case of fem. mšš.wt, the root must have been
*mšš or *mšj, while the same can hardly be true of the masc. LEg. term ()mšt or

PN I 166:8 & II 186). P. Kaplony (IÄF l.c.) read the exx. from the archaic period
alternatively as š2.
! Derives from Eg. š2 “schmücken, bekleiden” (PT, Wb IV 558) = “1. kreuzweise übereinanderlegen, 2. bedecken, bekleiden, schmücken” (Osing 1998, 818, n. 1077), cf. š2 “Art Kleid (eigtl. gekreuzte Bänder?)” (PT, Wb IV 558) = “un ornament” (AL 77.1897) = “garment: crossed bands (often worn by Libyans)” (Darnell 1995, 70 & fn. 124) = “gekreuzte Bänder (als Bekleidung und Brustschmuck)” (ÄWb I 1322).

[Mch. 1966, 133] is misleading and may be purely accidental (unless these forms
too represent m- derivatives of a root akin to Eg. š2 < *šk).
nb2: The AA etymology of Eg. š2 is uncertain. (1) A.Ju. Militarev (1983, 102, §7,
fn. 26; 1985 MS, 6, §26) derived it from AA *Gakw “(2/<9"!0 3&3 /<$!0) 9&0*0930”
[Mlt. 1984, 38] based on its comparison with Ar. šak5k- “corbeille à fruits”, cf. šakka
“se coller, s’attacher” [BK I 1256], Dathina škk “zusammennähen (in"lare)” [Rossi]
= “en"ler” [GD 2071] etc. (2) GT: or related to Hbr. Gkl II piel (hapax) “kreuzweise
legen” [GB 786] = “to lay over cross-wise, exchange, cross” [KB 1329] = “to lay

nb: Acc. to the new Berliner Wörterbuch (in preparation, kind p.c. by I. Hafemann,
19 May 2000) this may be the same word as mšd “(Subst., in einer Aufzählung
von Opfergaben)” (NK, Wb II 158, 13) from a common basic sense “p#anzliche
Opfergaben”.
! In the view of P. Kaplony (l.c.), it was “abgeleitet wohl ” from Eg. šdj “nehmen” on the analogy of OK mz (also in Abusir) < mz “bringen”.
mšd “être enterré” (CT VI 100c, hapax, AL 78.1883) = “to die (?)” (DCT 187 pace AECT II 145, spell 513, n. 8) = “*‘abkleben’, abbinden (Stellen vor dem Firnissen bei der Sargherstellung)” (ÄWb II 1145). ! Mng. uncertain, etymology obscure. R. O. Faulkner (AECT l.c.): “unintelligible”. Only speculative guesses have been made.
nb: (1) D. Meeks (AL l.c.) seems to have pondered a derivation from Eg. šdj
“graben” (OK, Wb IV 563, 1), while the rendering by (2) R. Hannig (ÄWb l.c.)
apparently suggests a link with Eg. šd.w “Art Taue (des Schiffes)” (CT, GHWb 842;
ÄWb II 2494), although the neither the dets. (šd.w with V1 “coil of rope”, mšd in
var. B1P b with D40 “forearm with hand holding stick”) nor the context of mšd in
CT VI 100c (- mt “to die” in B9C and B1BO) really support this. (3) GT: is this
the MK etymon of Dem. mšd “durchwandern” (Zeidler 1992, 208; 1998, 26, fn.

Zeidler, DELC l.c.) is dubious. A contamination of diverse (i.e., etymologically distinct) roots is not to be ruled out.
nb1: Note that Dem. mšd “durchwandern” (Zeidler 1992, 208; 1998, 26, fn. 30)
= “to wander” (Lpr. 1994, 127; 1995, 45) is not listed in DG and its existence
has been doubted by H. Satzinger (1999, 147–8). The Dem./Cpt. verb has been
explained from the Grundbedeutung “to pass through” (,erný in CED; Smith 1978,
361) = “den Flußübergang auskundschaften, den Fluß bedachtsam überqueren”
(Wst. in KHW).
nb2: Strangely, J. ,erný (CED 97) derived NK mšd.t from an unattested verbal root
*mšd preserved in Dem.-Cpt. Note that a connection with mšd “to interrogate”
(XIX. hapax, KRI II 108:6, Kitchen in RITA II 15, n. 28 ad 108:1) = “renvoyer (?)
qqn.” (AL 78.1380) = “zurückkehren” (GHWb 369), which is replaced by wšd “to
address, question” in the parallel version, is surely excluded as correctly stated by
H. Satzinger (1999, 147–8), who declined also the mng. “send away” and assumed
a denom. origin (< *mšd “investigation” < wšd wia m- pre"x).
nb3: J. Osing (NBÄ 261) assumed Cpt. (S) mo(o)vte (CD 207a) = “Gegend,
Nachbarschaft” (KHW) to derive (via pre-Cpt. *måšt.'y/t) from (the same root as)
(S) mouv«.
! Etymology highly disputed. Most likely seems #2. " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 8 following E. de Rougé and G. Maspero) explained it as the m- nomen loci of a false Eg. šd “couper, trancher” (sic), which is certainly mistaken. H. Grapow (1914, 31) too surmised in it a pre"x m- but carefully abandoned Ceugney’s idea. " 2. W. Westendorf (KHW 109, fn. 2), in turn, assumed it to represent the “m-Bildung des Ortes” of Eg. šdj.t “1. Art Landbezeichnung, 2. Art Gewässer” (Wb IV 567, 11–14) = “Gesamtheit der Äcker (eines Verwaltungsbezirks), 2. Wassergraben” (GHWb 845), while J. Osing (NBÄ 256) derived Eg. mšd.t directly from the underlying verbal root, Eg. šdj “graben” (OK, Wb IV 563, 1). " 3. H. Smith (1978, 361) regarded it as a deverbal noun of Eg. šdj “to draw forth”, i.e. *“(the place) which draws (one) forth (from the water)”, which he af"liated with Ar. šadda, which is probably to be excluded the basic senses of the latter being “1. to make an assult or attack upon, 2. be quick (in running), hasten, 3. make or render hard, "rm, compact, sound, 4. hence: bind, tie "rmly, fast or strongly” [Lane 1517]. Semantically rather weak. " 4. A.G. Belova (1989, 15), followed by G. Takács (2006, 114), treated it as of nomen loci derived from an unattested Eg. *šd ~ Sem. *G99, which should be subject to further research.

G99 “$/!(3*.” (sic) is unattested (GB, KB).
nb2: As for the shift of meaning in Eg., cf. e.g. Russ. $/!( “ford” vs. $/!(3*.# “to
wander, roam”.
" 5. J. Zeidler (1992, 208; 1998, 26, fn. 30) and A. Loprieno (1995, 45), in turn, derived Eg. mšd.t as a deverbal noun from the alleged old etymon of Dem. mšd “durchwandern” (which, acc. to J. Zeidler, “nicht mehr aufgrund einer phonetischen Variation aus . . . mš«j abgeleitet werden
konnte”) treated by them as the etymological Wurzeldublette (*mš9) of pre-Eg. *mšd preserved in Eg. mš«j “marschieren” (NK, Wb, cf.
above), which implies in J. Zeidler’s view that this Wort/Wurzelspaltung occured “schon in der Zeit, als der «/9-Wechsel möglich war”. J. Osing
(1997, 229) and H. Satzinger (1999, 147) rightly rejected this theory as it “semantically cannot be accepted ”.
nb: The fact, that in Cpt. “auch sonst Überschneidungen zwischen moove und mouvt
‘wandern’ auftreten” (Westendorf, KHW 109, fn. 1), does not necessarily indicate a
etymological relationship.
" 6. GT: its connection with Akk. mašdu > maldu “(etwa) Rand (?) 1. von Bett, 2. von Fluß (Erde)” [AHW 625] = “edge (?), side (?)” [CAD m1, 363] seems also unlikely.
mšd (GW) “Art Holzbearbeitung von Särgen” (XX., Wb II 158, 2) = “Aushöhlung” (Grapow 1914, 31; NBÄ 589, n. 518) = “to hollow (a cof"n)” ( JESHO 11, 1968, 154, n. k; Janssen 1975, 221 & fn. 77; DLE I 247) = “Art der Holzbearbeitung” (Helck 1971, 515, #123) = “(exact meaning unknown, but seems to have to do with carpentry in the Giornale and with the preparation of a cof"n in O.Petrie 16)” (Zonhoven, JEA 65, 1979, 96–97) = “to (be) hollow(ed) out (?)” (Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 81, 37, §1.2.4.1) = “aushöhlen (bei der Sargherstellung)” (GHWb 369).
nb: J. Hoch (1994, 212, §164) identi"ed its occurence attested in the Turin Necropolis
Journal (year 17, vs. 8, 10, 16) with mšdd.t “comb” (below), which has not been
supported by other authors.
! Origin uncertain (Helck l.c.: “ohne Ableitung”). No convincing etymology has been suggested. " 1. H. Grapow (l.c.) derived it from Eg. š3d “graben (von der Arbeit am Tempel von Redesieh, der zur Hälfte in den Fels gehöhlt ist)” (Grapow: LD III 140b). " 2. W.

mšd 641



" 3. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 37, §1.2.4.1) maintained the rendering “to hollow out” with a remark “unless the root is *šdy” (not detailed). " 4. L. Zonhoven (JEA 65, 1979, 96-97) assumed an etymological relationship with Eg. mšdd.t “comb” (below). " 5. GT: cp. perhaps Akk. maš3du G “1. walken (Stoff, Seite), 2. etwa massieren, 3. (mit Krankheit) schlagen, 4. etwa eindrücken (?) (Foetus)”, D “massieren (?)”, Š “hämmern (?) (Tiara)” [AHW 623] = G “to strike with palsy”, D “to rub” [CAD m1, 351]?
mšdd.t “Wagendeichsel” (XII. hapax, GHWb 369; ÄWb II 1145) = “Wagenteile” (WD III 57).
nb: Occurs in the great Memphis inscription of Amenemhet II, col. 18 (RdE
32, 1980, 77, col. 18; SAK 18, 1991, 14, pl., col. 18; JEA 78, 1992, 14, col. 18).
H. Altenmüller and A. Moussa (SAK l.c.) rendered it as part of a chariot (lit.
“Kamm”, but here “sind . . . Wagenteile gemeint”) “en dépit de la date du texte” as rightly
noted by D. Meeks (1997, 42, §212), who, together with J. F. Quack (1996, 510),
saw in it the MK etymon of LEg. mšdd.t “comb” (below).
! As suggested by H. Altenmüller and A. Moussa (SAK 18, 1991, 14, fn. 8), it might be identi"ed with Akk. (M/LBab.) mašaddu ~ mešeddu (Nuzi mašandu) “Deichsel” [AHW 622] = “1. pole (in gen.), 2. referring to the pole of the Wagon constellation” [CAD m1, 350–1], cf. OAkk. mašaddum “1. a weapon, 2. shaft of a wagon or a part of it” [Gelb 1973, 184].
nb1: The Akk. term for “pole” (nomen instr.) has been derived from Akk. šad3du
“ziehen” [AHW 1121] = “1. to pull taut, stretch, draw, pull (off ), 2. pull a cart,
tow a boat, bear a yoke, chair, haul, drag objects, transport, convey, drag down,
carry away, 3. remove, transfer, take along, bring along, 4. measure (out), survey (a
"eld), draw a line, 5. extend, stretch (intr.), etc.” [CAD š1, 20–21; Gelb 1973, 265].
W. von Soden (AHW l.c.) equated this root with Hbr. šdd qal “gewalttätig sein,
2. verheeren, verwüsten” [GB 808] = “to devastate, despoil, deal violently with”
[KB 1419], which is semantically very weak.
nb2: That this special mng. would have evolved independently in both Akk. and
Eg. is unlikely. A borrowing from Akk. seems, however, also dubious because of
the Genuswechsel.
mšdd.t (GW) “comb” (XX.: Ostr. Wien Äg. 1, CED 97; Zonhoven, JEA 65, 1979, 90, 96–97, §1.8; DLE I 247; Ward 1989, 76) = “peigne” (AL 77.1900; 79.1381) = “(Web)Kamm” (GHWb 369; WD I 96) > Cpt. (S) mivtwte, mvtwte, (B) mavqwti (f ) “weaver’s comb” (CD 207b; CED 97; Osing 1978, 186) = “Kamm” (KHW 109, 522) = “peigne” (DELC 129).
nb1: Vocalized by J. Hoch (l.c.) as *muš93ta (sic, *-9- vs. *-t-!) (?), which is certainly
erroneous. Perhaps *m'šdãd.'(t).
nb2: W. E. Crum (CD l.c.) derived the Cpt. re#ex from (S) mouvt “to examine,
search out” (CD 206b) = “durchwandern” (KHW), which was approved also by
642 mšdd.t



H. Smith (1978, 361) in his comment on CD 206b (“probably correctly”) in spite of
late NK mšdd.t and the Sem. parallels. This false idea was repeated by W. Vycichl
(DELC 129), who explained (S) m(i)vtwte either (!) from (S) mouvt or (!) from
Ar. mu>9-.
nb3: Following Altenmüller & Moussa (SAK 18, 1991, 14, fn. 8), J. F. Quack (1996,
510) and D. Meeks (1997, 42, #212) maintain that this LEg. term for “comb”
occured once already in the MK (Dyn. XII: Memphis inscription of Amenemhat
II), but this is disputed (cf. above).
! It has been usually explained as a Sem. borrowing eventually related to Akk. (from OAss./OBab. on) muš9u > mušdu ~ mul9u (fem.!), pl. muš93tu “Kamm”, muš39u “1. ausgekämmtes Haar, 2. Tuch aus ausgekämmter Wolle” [AHW 682, 687] = “comb” [CAD m2, 290] | Ebl. /mu:9um/ “Kamm” [Krebernik 1983, 44, #1359] !! Mand. maš9a “comb” [DM 255: from Ar.] | Ar. maša9a “peigner (les cheveux, la personne)”, maši9a “1. être comme les dents d’un peigne, 2. être couvert d’aspérités ou de déchirures et de crevasses (se dit des mains abîmées par un travail dur ou par les épines”, muš9“1. peigne de tisserand” [BK II 1110] = maša9a “to comb and dress (hair), loose and separate (hair) with the comb”, muš9- “1. comb, a curry comb, 2. an upright loom, a loom with which one weaves, set upright” [Lane 2717] !! ES (from Ar.): Tigre mässä9a, Tna. mäšä9ä “to comb” (ES: Lsl. 1982, 4), although the nature of this etymology has not been elucidated in all details.
lit. for Eg.-Sem.: CED 97; KHW 109; Smith 1978, 361; Hoch 1994, 164–5, §212.
The Cpt.-Ar. parallel was noted already by Rossi in 1808 (quoted in CED l.c.).
W. A. Ward (1989, 76) too assumed in LEg. mšdd.t a “foreign loan-word”.
nb1: The Sem. root has parallels in Brb. *)m-š-* > NBrb.: Shilh mš/* “peigner,
corder la laine” [ Jst. 1914, 145] | Qbl. e-mše* “peigner”, i-mše* “grand peigne
"xe qui retient la touffe de laine dont on tire le "l de chaîne”, ti-mše99, pl. ti-meš*-in
“peigne (à cheveux)” [Dlt. 1982, 482] !! EBrb.: Gdm. e-mš2* “1. peigner, 2. racler
la terre après semailles, pour recouvrir le grain”, ta-mš2/i9, pl. t2-mša9/* “peigne à

[Quibell 1918, 99] !! WBrb.: Zng. t2-mša*, pl. t2-måš9-2n ~ tu-m2š9-2n “peigne,
deméloir” [Ncl. 1953, 217] !!! LECu.: Saho mašši9 (m) “comb” [Vergari 2003, 134],
Afar musut (m), pl. musutitte ~ mus$ta (so, with -t) (f ) “comb” [PH 1985, 172]
!!! CCh.: Mada mèGé* mèGé* “lisse (barbe, cheveux) bien peigné” [Brt. & Brunet
2000, 185]. The ultimate origin of these AA parallels is hard to determine. Most
convenient would be to assume in Brb. and LECu. a late borrowing from Ar. (this
may be certainly the case, e.g., with Afar but hardly with Mada, for instance), albeit
there is no common agreement in the lit. on this.
nb2: On the other hand, it would be dif"cult to identify the proper Sem. source
of the LEg. word as well, whose syllabic structure excludes a borrowing from Akk.
or an etymon preserved in (or close to) Ar. mus9-. In addition, in the light of the
alleged MK (XII.) occurence, “on peut mettre en doute le fait que ce terme soit un emprunt”
as remarked by D. Meeks (1997, 42, §212). Similarly, R. Woodhouse (2003, 279–280,
#212) views that the MK attestation excludes the Eg.-Sem. comparison “despite the
evidence for being reborrowed from Semitic . . . since Ar. š points to Sem. *T (not *š) . . . despite
Hoch’s contradictory misgivings about this”. But if we accept the MK attestation, the
phonological correspondence can be regarded as regular (for Sem. *G ~ Eg. š see
EDE I 202–9). In this case, the new structure of Eg. mšdd.t could be also better

3. einziehen, 4. herausnehmen, 5. abliefern, 6. entnehmen”, ÄWb II 2494–6?).
nb3: M. Dietrich, O. Lorentz, and J. Sanmartín (1975, 164, §51) af"liated Akk.
muš39u (above) with Ug. m29 (an object that “zur Ausrüstung eines Mannes gehört”),
but the latter has been recently (DUL 606) rendered “oar” in comparison with Hbr.
m3š.9 “rudder” [KB 643], although its alleged relationship (suggested in KB l.c.)
with Ar. mi-swa/39- “a thing with which one mixes a thing and stirs it about, i.e.,
a stick or the like used for that purpose” < sw9 “to mix one part with another, stir
about and beat it until it become mixed” [Lane 1466–7] indicates PSem. *š- (and
not *2-). Strangely, Hbr. šw9 qal “1. to rove about, roam, 2. row” [KB 1440] has
been combined in KB l.c. with Ar. šw9 II “to make a long journey, become long (a
journey), voyage (with ship)” [Lane 1619], which is an entirely distinct root.
nb4: Hoch (l.c.) af"liated the LEg. word also with Akk. maš3du G “(Stoff ) walken
(?), etwa massieren”, “(mit Krankheit) schlagen (v. Schlaganfall)”, D “massieren”, Š
“hämmern (?)” [AHW 623] = maš3du “to comb out hair, card, comb wool”, *mašdu,
pl. mašd3tu “dressed or combed hair” [CAD m1, 351–2, 363] and even Hbr. šdd
qal “to harrow” [KB], which is certainly false. As for Akk. )mšd (combined in AHW
with Ar. msd D “massieren”), its basic sense seems also to be different.
nb5: Zonhoven ( JEA 65, 1979, 96-97) surmised a connection with Eg. mšd whose
“exact meaning is unknown, but seems to do with carpentry in the Giornale and with the preparation
of a cof!n in O.Petrie 16 ”. Alternatively, he erroneously analyzed mšdd.t as a compound

of Hbr maqq1l. Instead of *ma-nqil, Rundgren suggested *ma-qill, lit. “(etwa) was

nb: The existence of this fem. lexeme for “situla” is highly debated. The occurence in
PT 2286 has been rendered by R.O. Faulkner as “razor-case” (AEPT 318, utt. 756,
n. 1) = “étui à rasoir” ( Jéquier 1921, 127 with a dubious rdg.). A. H. Gardiner (1957,

VI, 62) = “(Augen)Höhle” (Osing apud JW 1997, 112-3, n. 3) claiming that “it is
unknown elsewhere, but both the determinative and the context point to its equivalence with” qrr.t
“als Stelle des Grabes, wo beim Begraben dem Toten (seiner Statue) geopfert wird
(wohl auf dem Dach der Mastaba über dem Schacht)” (OK, Wb IV 61, 14) and qrr.t
“Höhlung, Loch” (MK, Wb IV 62, 1). Nevertheless, D. Meeks (AL 79.1382; 1997,

fem. counterpart just as C. Evrard-Derriks & J. Quaegebeur (1979, 49, fn. 2) supposed.
! From the same root (?): mqr (GW) ~ var. mkr (1x: Pap. BM 10209, 2:12, cf.

in Eg. Ar. (Bag$r) makro “mortar” (Ishaq 1991, 117, §xxi.3). C. Evrard-Derriks &
J. Quaegebeur (1979, 48) saw in LEg. mqr3 a var. corroborating the connection with
(B) makro. This evidence hardly accords with Hoch’s (l.c.) hypothetic LEg. *maq$rû.
However, A. Volten (quoted in KHW 518 & fn. 1 and AL 77.1916) explained the
Cpt. word from Eg. mgrg “Art Krug” (CT, Wb, below). S. Cauville (1982–83, 137,
mqr.t

s.v. mqr, fn. 5 pace Monnet & Saleh) rejected the equation of LEg. mqr with situla.
J. Hoch (1994, 167, §218) doubted even the identity of the two LEg. occurences of
mqr and their relationship to (B) makro.
! Mng. and origin disputed. No convincing etymology has been suggested. " 1. J. Quaegebeur & C. Evrard-Derriks (CdE 54, 1979, 48–49) and (apparently independently) J. Hoch (l.c., cf. also DUL 568) compared it (Hoch only the ex. of Ani l.c., while the former authors also PTMK fem. mqr.t) with Akk. (LBab.) maqartu “ein Gefäß” [AHW 605] = “a vessel” [CAD m1, 240] !!

Hoch meant a borrowing from Sem., but as rightly remarked by D. Meeks (1997, 43, #218), the PT/MK attestation hardly allows this. In addition, Quaegebeur and Evrard-Derriks (o.c., p. 49 & fn. 1) themselves doubted the Sem. etymology: “toutefois, le rapprochement se heurte à certaines dif!cultés” ("rst of all, according to G. Roquet, the case of Cpt. -k- < Eg. -k/q- ~ Sem. *-=-).
nb: The common origin and the etymologies of the Sem. comparanda are disputed.
W. von Soden (AHW l.c., followed by CAD l.c.) explained the Akk. term as a late
borrowing from Aram., cf. JAram. m2qart3 “Kühlung”. J. Hoch af"liated the Ug.
Akk. parallel with Ar. miqr3-t- “1. grand réservoir d’eau, 2. grande écuelle dans
laquelle on sert à manger à plusieurs hôtes à la fois” [BK II 730–1] = “a large bowl”
[Hoch] = “Schüssel” [WUS], which is unlikely the underlying Ar. root being qry
“recevoir qqn. comme hôte” [BK]. G. del Olmo Lete & J. Sanmartín (DUL l.c. pace
Hava), in turn, compared the Ug.-Akk. word with Ar. maqarr-at- “petite cruche” <
qrr “5. être frais, 8. verser un peu d’eau fraîche sur ce qui boût, 9. refraîchir qqn.
en jetant sur lui de l’eau fraîche, 10. couler, glisser, souf#er secrètement qqch. dans

" 2. J. F. Quack (1994, 123, fn. 142), who was even referring to CdE 54, 1979, 46–48 (where the MK attestation is also mentioned), suggested that LEg. mqr “könnte von hebr. m3q.r ‘Quell’ (sic) entlehnt sein”. Absurd.

H.-J. Thissen (et al. 1980, 64) did not render: “Eine andere Lesung ist wohl nicht möglich;
statt des m ein š zu lesen, ist . . . ausgeschlossen. Trotzdem bleibt die Frage nach der Bedeutung”,
for which Thissen suggested two alternative etymologies: (1) ~ Dem. mgt (read by
J. Johnson as mge.t, cf. Ray 1976, nr. 19, vs. 8:21, rt. 18) which J. Ray (1976, 76,
n. h) combined with Cpt. (B) moki “Gefäss” (CD 161b) or Dem. mgwt.t “Sänfte
Bahre”; (2) ~ (S) makot, magat “Dolch, Lanze”. Thissen identi"ed the det. of
Dem. mgt as a “nachlässig ausgeführte Schreibung des Messers oder des schlagenden Armes”,
which “spräche für die zweite der angeführten Möglichkeiten. Der Sinn der beiden Zeilen bleibt
dennoch unklar ”. J. Johnson (kind p.c., 17 April and 14 May 2007) too suggests that
it might be related either to Dem. mge.t “vessel, jar” or to Cpt. (S) makot (for
discussion see also Vittmann, Enchoria 11, 1982, 123).
! Etymology obscure. D. J. Wölfel (1955, 122, §6, cf. §8) saw in it an old Mediterranean Wanderwort related to NBrb.: Snus a-megdi “marteau à tailler la pierre” !!

nb1: J. ,erný (1965, 8) saw in it a “material and not a speci"c garment”, although E.
Edel (1974, 145, fn. 3) found that at least in two instances of the material examined
by ,erný “scheint es allerdings ein Gewand zu bezeichnen”, whence he has concluded that
“das sind Widersprüchlichkeiten, denen zuliebe man zunächst ein mk I ‘eine bestimmte Stoffqualität
und ein sehr seltenes mk II ‘ein Gewand’ unterscheiden möchte”. J. J. Janssen & R. M. Jans
sen (2000, 179) doubted the two diverse signi"cations suggested by E. Edel (l.c.),
P. Grandet (l.c.), and R. Hannig (GHWb l.c.) as unfounded because they see no
convincing evidence for mk as an item of clothing.
nb2: Presumably re#ected also in cuneiform, cf. Amarna Akk. (Boghazköy) miku “(a
quality of textiles)” [CAD m2, 66: “Eg. word”], which, however, can hardly re#ect
an Eg. *mñk'w (that would have presumably yielded Amarna *mika), but perhaps
better *m)kw'w as rightly noted by E. Edel (1974, 144).
nb3: Perhaps the same word has been preserved by the supposed "rst component
of Hbr. *mikn3s (dual st.cstr. miknis1-) “Unterbeinkleider (der Priester)” [GB 422]
= (st. cstr. mikn2s1) “the leggings of the priests (Noth, Hönig), a loin-cloth in two

cography) derived from Hbr. )kns “to sit”, but already N. L. Tidwell (VT 24, 1974,
507) has regarded the underlying root as “uncertain”, while M. Görg (1975, 17–18)
explained the OT word as a borrowing of Eg. *mk-nsw “königliches Schutzgewand
(o.ä.)”, although the vocalization of Eg. nsw as *nãs in the “UEg. dial.” (Fecht 1960,
§31, §34, §37–38, §102; Helck 1976, 122; 1984, 256; Snk. 1968, 539; Kahl 1994,

" 1. J. ,erný (1965, 17), followed by M. Görg (l.c.) and Grandet (l.c.), derived it from Eg. mkj “schützen” (OK, Wb, below). ,erný’s theory was adopted by E. Edel (1974, 144–5) with reservations (“Leider fehlt eine sichere Etymologie dieses *mñkw'w”) and restricting this etymology only to mk II, while for mk I, “amehesten denkbar erscheint . . . eine Verbindung mit dem . . . erst in ptol. Zeit belegten mk ‘Fest; festlich sein’ (Wb II 162, 7–10)”, whereby in the case of mk I “es läge dann ein ‘festlicher’ Stoff vor ”, i.e., a “festliche Stoffqualität”. Alternatively, “falls beide Worte gleich sind ”, Edel did not rule out a rendering of mk I as “eine magische Schutz(stoff )”. " 2. GT: a connection with Sem.: Ebl. mu-gú /mukk-u(m)/ “an inferior quality of wool” [Frz. 1984, 146] or NAgaw: Qwara m3=- “a kind of clothing” [LS 1997, 476] and HECu.: Sid. mâge (f ) “woof ” [Gsp. 1983, 219] seems unlikely.
nb: M. Lamberti (LS l.c.) combined the Qwara word with NOm. *may"- “to
dress” [GT], which he erroneously derived from an OCu. *m#à=- (cf. also LEg. mj
“MumieNBinde” above).
mk “überzogen sein mit Gold u.ä. (von Gegenständen aller Art)” (LP, GR, Wb II 162, 1–2) = “couvrir, envelopper” (Beauregard 1892, 182) = “(re)couvrir” (Loret 1894, 94) = “recouvrir, plaquer (d’un métal)” (2nd IMP: 1x, Cairo stela 38917, AL 79.1388: cf. El-Sayed, BIFAO 79, 1979, 168–170, esp. 173, t. 47, l. 4) = “überziehen” (ÄWb II 1152 with further lit.). ! Hence: mk “Überzug, Beschlag (aus Gold) eines Tores” (LP, Wb II 162, 3). " 1. The Wb (l.c.) explained it as a late form of old b3k “etwas ‘belegen’ mit einem feineren Stoff, ihn damit überarbeiten, (mit Gold) überziehen, vergolden, (mit Erz) beschlagen, (mit Lapislazuli) auslegen” (Wb I 427, 6–9), cf. also Keimer 1984, 40, n. 9 (with parallels for the shift of old b > m). The attestation from the 2nd IMP, however, seems to speak for a distinct root. " 2. O. Beauregard (1892, 182) and P. Wilson (PL l.c.), in turn, suggested a derivation from (or, at least, a connection with) Eg. mkj “to protect”, which was in Wilson’s opinion “extended in use for overlaying sg. with gold ”, since this “is the same as protecting it ”.
ap: Of interest might be (as AP) PNil. *muk “to cover” [Dimmendaal 1988, 36,
#36]. For the semantic change “to protect” < “to cover” cf. e.g. IE *wer- V “1.

mk3.t “stützender Unterbau” (OK, Wb II 162, 13) = “supporting, resting place, support (designed esp. to maintain in an upright posture a patient having a serious wound in the skull)” (Breasted 1930, 151, 236) = “Unterlage, Stütze” (WMT 399) = “1. support, pedestal, 2. trunk” (FD 119) = “1. socle, estrade, 2. lit funéraire” (AL 77.1908; 78.1890) = “als Bezeichnung der Mumienbahre” (Pfortenbuch, Hornung 1980, 169) = “1. supporting substructure, a structural support (horizontal beneath an object), a base, a platform, a pedestal or socle, a stela base, funerary bier etc., sometimes also a vertical, upright support such as a brick pillar (possibly also the supporting pillar behind statues) or column, 2. anatomical pillar (in human anatomy denotes vertical structures), probably not the entire trunk but only the spinal column within it, speci"cally the thoracic spine (behind the heart and mediastinum or the breast-bone in front of them) to which the cervical spine (wsr.t) is attached (or upon which the heart resides), 3. also the sternum (breast-bone, as support of the collar-bones)”, cf. mk3.t-jb/%3tj “a horizontal platform under the heart (perhaps a diaphragm?) or could be a vertical pillar supporting it (perhaps the sternum or spine?)” (Walker 1996, 155–6, 197, 199–202) = “1. stützender Unterbau (z.B. zwei Ziegel), Sockel, Podium, 2. Totenbahre” (GHWb 371; ÄWb I 573: V. 1x; ÄWb II 1152: CT VII 15k, VI 278o).
nb1: J. H. Walker (l.c.) maintains that the rendering “base (of the heart)” or “trunk
(torso)” and also “frame (i.e., the support surrounding the object) of the chest, i.e. rib
cage” (pace Borghouts 1978, 57) is “probably erroneous” in anatomical contexts, where
the basic sense “pillar (most often thoracic spine)” "ts well in every such context.
nb2: To be distinguished from mk.t “Stelle, Platz (richtige Stelle)” (PT, Wb, above)
in spite of Wb l.c.; Breasted 1930, 150–1; Walker 1996, 155, 197. But a contami
nation of the two lexemes (in the view of Walker 1996, 199, already in the PT) is
quite possible.
! Hence: mk3.tj “Art Gott” (NK, Wb II 162, 14) = “celui qui est couché sur son lit de mort” (AL 77.1909) = “he of the pillar” (Walker 1996, 199 after Hornung). For LP mk3tj (?) (Wb II 162, 15) cf. also Faulkner 1936, 140. From the same root: (1) mk3 “base (?) (the det. looks like a stela standing on a foundation slab)” (CT VI 176f, AECT II 174–5, spell 572, n. 10) = “socle, estrade” (AL 78.1890) = “pedestal, base” (DCT 187: also CT VI 237v, VI 278o), perhaps cf. also (2) mk3 “Vertiefung (wie sie durch einen Tritt hervorgerufen wird)” (Med., Wb II 162, 12) = “(perhaps a noun designating) some injury or dis"gurement of the nose (whereby the lower, #eshy and cartilaginous portions of nose might abruptly project, suggesting a support or notch or depression – this is only a hazardous guess)”
mk3.t



660
(Breasted 1930, 234, 236) = “einebnen, planieren” (WMT 399; GHWb 371). ! Origin disputed. Most convincing seems solution #2. " 1. W. Westendorf (1980, 101) and J.H. Walker (1996, 198) see in it an m- pre"x derivative of a hypothetic Eg. *k3( j) “heben, tragen” (Wst.) = *k3j “to carry, lift into being, produce, create by physical labour” (Walker), i.e., *m-k3.t, lit. “die Stelle, die etwas zu tragen in der Lage ist” (Wst.) having “strong connection with lifting sg. into being, with the erection and construction of buildings (re"ected by the determinatives stairway, stela on pedestal, brick, house, pillar?)” (Walker). Dubious.
nb1: The underlying verbal root is unattested. It cannot have been identical with Eg.
k3wt “tragen, hochheben” (GR, Wb V 103), which is a denom. verb of k3.t “Arbeit,
Tätigkeit” (OK Wb V 98) just like Eg. k3w.tj “Art Arbeiter” (MK, Wb V 102) = “a
porter, a builder’s labourer” (FD). W. Westendorf erroneously af"liated these words
also with Eg. k3 “Geist als Teil der menschlichen Persönlichkeit, Kraft, Eigenschaft”
(OK, Wb V 86–89) = “Ka: Hebekraft” (Wst.), *k (Wst.: *k3j/w!) “Art Korb” (Wb
V 83, 1) = “Trage(korb)” (Wst.), sk3 “Erhöhung als Bezeichnung des Thrones”
(Wb IV 316, 14), sk3 “(den Acker) p#ügen bzw. bestellen, (Getreide) aNBauen (Wb
IV 315–6) explained by Westendorf from a primary sense “zum Tragen bringen,
(Ertrag) liefern lassen” (sic). Walker derived even Eg. mkj “to protect” (OK, below)
from *k3j, which is equally unconvincing. For a critical appraisal of Westendorf ’s
etymologies cf. Takács 2005, 331–2, §iii, fn. 21–23.
nb2: Nevertheless, a remote connection of Eg. k3.t with Sem. *krr “to lay” [GT]:
Akk. kar3ru “setzen, stellen, legen” [AHW 447] !! Tigre kärära “to lie” [Lsl. 1964,
117] (Akk.-Tigre: Lsl. l.c.) !!! SOm.: Hamer (Galila) kari “place” [Bnd. 1994, 156]
!!! Ch. *kar2 “to carry” [Nwm. 1977, 24, #24] = *k-r- “to load” [NM 1966, 237]
cannot be excluded. C. T. Hodge (1978 MS, 2, #24; 1981, 234; 1981, 371) already
related Akk. krr and Ch. *k-r- [NM] to Eg. k3.t “work” (PT, Wb V 98–101) and
even to LECu.: Somali kár-ayya ~ karáynayya “is able to do” [Abr. 1964, 148],
although the latter is semantically dubious. AP: PCKhoisan *kuru “to do, make”
[Baucom 1972, 21]. Although a direct (inner Eg.) connection of Eg. k3.t vs. mk3.t
is rather unlikely (on semantic grounds), but an ultimate common origin (from AA
*k-r “to lay” or sim. [GT]) is plausible. In this case, Eg. mk3.t (*mkr.t) might be
indeed regarded as an m- pre"x form and its basic sense could be rendered *“(on)
what (sg.) is put down”.
" 2. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 199, #1783) equated it with LECu.: Afar makara (f ) “foundation”, makare ~ makre “to prepare a base, foundation” [PH 1985, 161] < AA *makr- “to make a base or foundation”, which "ts well the mng. “Unterbau” (Wb).
nb: GT: cp. perhaps also Agaw *"2nkw2r- [if *-nkw- < *-mkw-] “to put, place” [Apl.]:
Hamir 2qw2r-, Hamta 2gw2r ~ iqwir-, Qwara 2n0w2r-, Falasha on0or-, Qemant
2n0w2r-, Kailinya 2qw2r- | Awngi 2nkwr- (Agaw: Apl. 1989 MS, 4, fn. 10; 1991 MS,
10; 1994 MS, 3; 1996, 16). D. Appleyard (1989 MS, 4) combined the Agaw root
with ECu. *g3r- “to pick up, collect” (via pre"xed *mV-gur- > Agaw *"2nkw2r-),
which is semantically unlikely.
" 3. GT: if, in turn, the mng. underlying root was just the opposite, cf. perhaps Sem.: JNAram. mukra “heap (of stones)” [Sabar 2002, 213: < ?].

although an alternative etymology is also available, cf. Eg. ng3g3 [< *ngrgr?] “se
lever (en parlant du vent)” (CT II 1171, AL 78.2266), which was rendered by R. O.
Faulkner “to lack, be destitute” (AECT I 104, spell 106, n. 9).
" 4. GT: or cp. Ar. )mkl: muk$liyy- “vil, bas”, makila “contenir de la vase au fond (se dit d’un puits)”, mum3kil- “qui ramasse et conserve tout ce qu’il trouve par terre” [BK II 1138]?
mk3 (or mk?) “tapfer, kühn (vom Herzen)” (Lit. MK, Wb II 50, 6) = “brave” (FD 105) = “standhaft, tapfer” (Wst. 1989, 88) = “(m«k3-jb)
tapfer, kühn, draufgängerisch (wie Löwen)” (GHWb 329).
nb: The root cannot have been m«k3 (as in Wb, FD, and GHWb), since *«k do not
occur in native Eg. roots (cf. Peust 1999, 298; EDE I 323). For this reason, -«- can
only be considered as purely orthographical. Whether the same is true about the
"nal -3 (i.e., only mk is to be read), remains open.
! Etymology highly disputable. " 1. W. Westendorf (1989, 88) explained it from Eg. mk.t “die richtige Stelle auf der ein Körperteil sich be"nden muß (zumeist vom Herzen)” (Wb II 161, 9) and mk3.t “stützender Unterbau” (Wb II 162, 13) rendering the primary meaning of mk3-jb as “Herz auf dem (rechten) Fleck”. Unconvincing. " 2. R. Hannig (GHWb 329), in turn, referred to Eg. mk3 “aufmerken” (q.v.) apparently suggesting an alternative rendering of *mk3-jb as “aufmerksam”. Possible. " 3. GT: a cognacy with the isolated CCh.: Kotoko màg_μrá “coura
geux” [Bouny 1978, 109] = m3¿ Ürá “courage” [Bouny & Jouannet
1978, 185] is rather uncertain.
nb: The Ch. origin of the Kotoko word is obscure. In principle, a hypothetic AA
*m-k-r “brave” [GT] might be supposed, whose *-r might be a root extension pro
vided we assume a connection with AA *m-[k] “brave” [GT] (below).
" 4. G. Takács (2006, 677–8, #387) assumed a GW for )mk which he combined it with SBrb.: Ayr 2-mu=, pl. i-mu=--n (m) “homme de coeur, valeur” [PAM 2003, 533] !!! SCu.: WRift *magi “braveness” [KM] > Irq. migi “braveness, courage, daring” [MQK 2002, 73], Brg. mag$m3 “diligence” [KM] (WRift: KM 2004, 198) !!!

Cpt. re#ex from old mkj “(Körperteile) schützen” (NK, Wb II 160, 15) = “to protect

which seems unlikely and has not been con"rmed by other authors.
nb2: W. Vycichl (1983, 110) rejected the Eg.-SBrb. isogloss arguing that the primary
meaning of Hgr. e-mmek [Vcl.: < *e-wmek] was “indication, conduite, moyen,

“nur eine Ableitung von dem im NR belegten semitischen Fremdwort mkr ‘Kaufmann’ . . . sein”

disputed rendering, cf. Grd. 1957, 50, fn. 2 and the entry for Eg. mqr.t “situla”
above), which is unacceptable for several reasons: (1) it is hardly credible that a
hapax Sem. loan-word reappears seven centuries (!) later (2) in a fully different new
mng. (derivation of a new word is not at all typical with loan-words in Eg.). (3)
The late hapax mqr.t can be better explained from late NK mgr.t (GW) “Höhle”

not a French loan (not indicated as such in PAM l.c. either) but rather “it should be

! Origin highly debated. " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 9) erroneously saw in it the m- pre"x form of LEg. q% (head det.), which is in fact a fully distinct lexeme (cf. Wb V 66, 12–13) whose head det. is due to a mere association to the phon. value %3. H. Smith (1979, 161) explained both mk%3 and m%3 as m- pre"x derivatives of Eg. %3 “back of head” (Wb III 8, 5–11). Also W. Vycichl (DELC 110) assumed a pre"x m- but left the simplex unmentioned. " 2. K. Sethe (followed by a number of authors) analyzed it as a compound of Eg. mkj “to protect” + %3 “occiput”, literally “Schützer des Hinterkopfes” (Sethe) = “protecteur de l’occiput” (Vrg.) = “protecteur de l’arrière (de la tête)” or “protection de l’occiput” (Vcl.). G. Fecht rendered the "rst part *m)k- > (S) mak- as a participle, which would, however, require an impf. *mkk in the MK.

" 3. W. Westendorf (1962, 43, §68) surmised in it an extended var. of Eg. m%3 with “Zusatz von k (?)” (!) wondering “ob es sich um einen Übergangslaut handelt, der nicht als b oder p, sondern wegen des folgenden . . . % als palataler Verschlußlaut realisiert wurde”, although he was only disturbed by the “Schwierigkeit . . ., daß die betr. Konsonanten nicht aneinander stoßen, sondern durch den Tonvokal getrennt sind ”.
" 4. Others assumed a compound of two juxtaposed synonymous terms, where %3 denotes “occiput”, while the "rst component might be compared with Bed. m.k ~ máge (f ) “Hals” [Almkvist 1885, 48 apud Rn. 1895, 164] = m.k ~ máka, pl. m.ka “Hals, Nacken” [Rn. 1895, 167] = mok, pl. moka (f ) “front external part of neck”, m’áge (m) “neck, nape of neck” [Rpr. 1928, 214–5] = m’aggi (m) “neck”, m.k (f ) “front part of the neck” [Hds. 1996 MS, 90, 92], cf. Bed. to"-mok “der Nackenpreis der Frau” [Munzinger], Bisharin mäk,
pl. máge “neck” [Zbr. 1976, 20/130] (Bed.: Rn. 1895, 167; Zbr. 1978, 371), which is probably cognate also with EBrb.: Siwa ta-migâ “neck” [Quibell 1918, 103] = ta-m2Ca “cou” [Lst. 1931, 218]. The Bed.-Siwa isogloss may have further AA equivalents denoting some back and/or lower part of the trunk of body, cf. Ar. makw-at- “cul, derrière” [BK II 1140] !!!

ap: V. Bla&ek (1987, 159; 2000, 185–6, §21; 2000 MS, 5, §21) af"liated the underlying
AA *muk- “1. neck, 2. back” with remote Nst. paralllels like Drv. *mak(k)- “neck”
[DED #4622], Ur. *muka “back” [Sammallahti], Alt.: Korean mok “neck, throat”,
and Pamir Iranian: Shugni & Wakhi m3k, Sarikoli mok & Ishkashim mak “back of
the neck, nape” [Morgenstierne].
nb1: M. Lamberti (1988, 93, §115) combined the Bilin word with LECu.: Som.-Jiddu
g.m2 “vagina” (via met.), which is rather unconvincing because of the signi"cant
semantic change and the met. at a time.
nb2: The origin of SAgaw: Awngi m3qñ “spalla, schiena” [CR 1905, 168] = m3ck (so,
-ck) “spalla” [Waldmyeer/CR] = maq “shoulder” [Hetzron 1978, 140] is not yet clear.
nb3: W. Vycichl (1983, 110) ex cathedra rejected the Eg.-Bed. comparison arguing
that the morpheme boundary in Eg. was m-k%3 (although he failed to mention any
evidence in favour of *k%3), while he arbitrarily derived Bed. m.k from a triliteral
*m3keC3, pl. mak < *makC3ew (although he failed to list parallels for this pattern).
Therefore, the objection of Vycichl can hardly be accepted. The Eg.-Cu. compari
son may still be correct and one may explain Eg. -%3 two ways: (1) either identical
with Eg. %3 “Hinterkopf ” (PT, Wb III 8) = “occiput, back of ear” (FD 161) and
thus the proper Eg. correspondence of the Cu. cognates would be only mk-. (2)
In Afar maku% ~ muko% ~ muku%, the "nal -% probably represents the common
AA nominal class marker occuring in anatomical terms (Takács 1997). If Afar -%
is identical with the -%- of Eg. mk%3, we have to suppose an original Eg. *mk%,
which was only later extended to mk%3 due to a popular etymology in#uenced by
Eg. %3 as supposed already by W. Westendorf (1962, 43, fn. 2).
" 5. L. Reinisch (1873, 245) linked it to Eg. m4«q (!) and bgz “Hals”
(!) and even Teda ta5, dubu “Nacken, Hals”, which is absurd. " 6. G. von der Gabelentz (1894, 158–9) compared it with Bsq. gibel “Rücken”. Equally false.
mk#3 “vernachläßigen, sich nicht kümmern um” (XVIII., Wb II 163, 7–12) = “to disregard” (Grd. 1910, 94, n. i) = “to turn the head” (Alb.) = “être negligent” (Posener 1950, 297) = “to ignore, eschew (evil), be neglectful of (%r)” (FD 119) = “se détourner, négliger” (AL 77.1911: cf. Zivie 1976, 85, n. hhh ad l. 21) = “verabscheuen, sich enthalten, vermeiden” (Fischer-Elfert 1986, 30, 38) = “1. vernachläßigen, sich nicht kümmern um, sich abwenden von (%r, n, r), meiden, 2. verabscheuen” (GHWb 372; ÄWb I 573: 1x in 1st IMP, ÄWb II 1152: 1x XII./XIII.). Cf. also mq% “beseitigen” (late NK: Pap. Sallier I rt. 8:10, Wb II 159, 9) = “to neglect, forsake” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 325).

nb1: A. H. Gardiner (1955, 2) found the rendering “vernachläßigen” (Wb) as “surely
not strong enough”.
nb2: It has nothing in common with Cpt. (S) moukH “af#igere” (in fact, < Dem.
mq%, above) as suggested by G. Maspero (1903, 176).
" 1. Usually conceived as a denom. verb of Eg. mk%3 “back of the head” (Grd., above), lit. “(eigtl.) den Hinterkopf zuwenden” (Wb) = “to turn the back upon/to” (Grd., FD, DLE).

Fischer-Elfert 1986, 38.
" 2. W. F. Albright (1927, 218) and F. von Calice (1936, #641) equated it with Ar. kama%a “tirer à soi avec la bride (la tête du cheval)” & kama0a “1. id., 2. dresser le nez, le porter au vent” [BK II 928–9] = “to raise a horse’s head with the bridle” [Alb.] = “den Kopf des Pferdes mit dem Zügel hochziehen” [Clc.], Geez (ta)makk2%a “to praise o’self, glorify o’self, boast, brag, puff up, be honored” [Lsl.], Tigre (t2)mäkk2%a “to brag” [LH 132] etc. (ES: Lsl. 1982, 51; 1987, 339), which Albright explained from the basic sense *”to have one’s head turned”. Semantically unconvincing. In addition, Eg. -%- + Ar. -0-. Rightly rejected by W. Vycichl (DELC 110), although merely because he supposed a pre"x m- in Eg. mk%3 (+ Sem. *km%).
nb: Calice even supposed Eg. mk%3 to represent “vielleicht . . . ein Lehnwort (!)” that
“durch Volksetymologie an äg.: %3 ’Hinterkopf ’ angeglichen worden [ist]”. A borrowing (Eg.
< Sem.) can be here safely excluded.
" 3. GT: if the Eg. root was *mk% (whose wtg. was in#uenced by mk%3 “back of the head” as supposed by Calice), a noteworthy parallel emerges in Akk. (O/YBab.) mekû ~ makû “vernachläßigen, nachläßig sein”, (OBab.) m1kûm “inaktiver Mann”, (OBab.) temkûm “Vernachläßigung”, (Y/LBab.) mik5tu “Versäumnis (?)” [AHW 643, 651, 1346] = mekû ~ makû “to be negligent, neglect a task, disregard sg.” [CAD m2, 8].

nb1: Following H. Kees, W. Spiegelberg (1917, 102 & 103, fn. 3) maintains that the mng. “Behälter” in fact “mit dem ‘Schattenstab’ der Statuen nichts zu tun hat”, i.e., “von unserem m(j)ks-Futteral ist . . . das Zepter mks . . . zu trennen”.
nb2: Its combination with Cpt. (scalae) miakhs “Muscheln” (suggested by H. Brugsch
in his Wb VI 574) was doubted by W. Spiegelberg (1917, 101, §6 & 103), since it has “gewiß keine zureichende Begründung” and so this “läßt man besser ganz beiseite, da es nur durch Kircher belegt ist. . . . Sollte es wirklich existieren, so würde sich die die Perle umschließende Muschel gut mit dem Begriff des schützenden Futterals zusammenstellen lassen”.
! Etymology debated. Most attractive seems the 2nd possibility. " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 9) and G. Jéquier (1921, 150–1; 1921, 176) explained it from Eg. kz “se coucher” (Ceugney) = “courber,

Barta (LÄ IV 20–21) as well as K. Goebs (1995, 156) and P. Wilson (PL 473) saw in Eg. mks a derivation extended by the Ableitungssuf!x -s occuring in the names of other royal insignia (on the analogy of Eg. 3m-s, j3q-s, šm«-s, m%w-s, m2%-s, %r-s,
%q3-s, %t-s, on which cf. also Sethe quoted in Spg. 1917, 103, fn. 2 and Fecht, SAK 1, 1974, 179f.). Barta and Osing identi"ed the root with Eg. mkj “to protect” (above), which could be compared with Geez makkwaya (var. makwasa) “3. to guard, protect one another” [Lsl. 1987, 341]. Eg. mks might have thus literally denoted “Schutzhülle (für den Papyrus), die zu einem Abzeichen königlicher Würde geworden ist” (Spg., Barta). " 3. GT: a connection (via met.) with Ar. masaka I “1. mettre la main sur, saisir, 2. tenir beaucoup, avoir de la capacité (se dit d’une outre, etc.)”, masika “se contenir, se maîtriser” [BK II 1105] = I “prendre (une chose avec soi), arrêter, emprisonner, se maintenir” [Dozy II 591] = IV “1. garder son mari, 2.

rowed from Can. The Can. word has been traditionally explained from Can. *gdl
“big, etc.” (GB 396; Harris 1936, 93; Gordon 1955, 250, #392; WUS #632; KB

proved the existence of this gloss. In the Nile hymn VIIa (Pap. Sallier II 13:1),
they regard mg3.(t) as a corruption of m g3w “in Mangel” (Seibert) = “à l’état de

“traurig” as lectio facilior for m-g3w “in Not”. The form mgj in the stela of famine
(l. 3), in the view of D. Meeks, “en dépit de la graphie, pourrait être compris exactement de
la même façon”, although P. Seibert saw in it rather “eine abwegige Schreibung von b3gj”,
while P. Barguet (BdE 24, 15) accepted Wb’s mg3 “traurig”. In Pap. Anastasi VII
rt. 3:8, in turn, D. Meeks (AL 77.1914–5) assumes mg3.t to represent “sûrement un

by J. F. Quack (1996, 510, #227) and D. Meeks (1997, 43, §227), these forms have
to be distinguished from LEg. mgr and be identi"ed rather as the LEg. re#exes of
old m«q “1. Grillspieß, 2. grillen” (OK, Wb, above) = “1. la brochette, 2. griller
sur une brochette” (Meeks). Cf. also Verhoeven (1984, 50, fn. 1).

derivaton from LEg. mgr seems more likely.
nb3: Following the p.c. by D.B. Redford, J. Hoch (1994, 171 & fn. 210) was disposed

long demonstrated the IE background of the Gk. word (and hence, of Lat. mag5ra
“art du cuisinier”, cf. Ernout & Meillet 1959, 377), which literally signi"ed “qui
pétrit, qui prépare le manger”, cf. Gk. μ)317, gen. μ)310o7 “pâte pétrie, pain” < IE
*maX- “frotter en pressant, pétrir” [Boisacq] = “kneten, drücken, streichen” [IEW
696]. In the light of these facts, an Eg. origin can hardly be maintained.
! Rdg. and origin debated. " 1. Eg. mgr was treated in Wb V 181, 3 as prep. m + gr. This analysis was declined in DLE I 250 and Hoch 1994, 171, #227. " 2. J. Hoch (1994, 171, #227) reconstructed *maqala, which related with Sem. *=lw “to burn, roast”, although he admitted that “the m- is problemetic” (since this Sem. root was used only in G-stem). He assumed this to be due to a confusion with (or a back-formation from) LEg. mqr ~ mq«r “hearth” (cf. above), since “the Egyptians must have assumed
the root was *mql and not qly”, for which Hoch (1994, 171, fn. 213) thinks to have found an analogous LEg. m- root “which . . . apparently resulted from mistaking the mem-preformative as the !rst root consonant”. Since Hoch’s LEg. vars. with -q are probably to be separated from the -gforms, a comparison with Sem. *=lw is phonologically hardly possible. " 3.

corroborated also by the "re det. of mg3 “eine unbekannte P#anze” (Med., Wb, above). Whether we assume m + gr or a distinct lexeme mgr, it would be hard to separate our word from AA *g2r “"re” [Dlg.] = *gur- “ash” vs. *gir- “"re” [OS] = *g-r “to burn” [GT].

& Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 13), in turn, explained it from Sem. *3ry (sic).
nb2: GB 397 af"liated Eg. mgr.t with Hbr. m2g$r3 “Vorratskammer” (for which
cf. Eg. m0r above).
mgrg “Art Krug” (MK, Wb II 164, 12) = “grand vase à une puri"cation spéciale destinée à donner la vie éternelle au mort” ( Jéquier 1921, 151) = “une verseuse en pierre, vase à puri"cations” ( Jéquier 1921, 314) > mngrg “Krug für Öl” (late NK, Wb II 91, 9). ! Its m- pre"x has been surmised already by H. Grapow (1914, 32), although he was unable to "nd its simplex, which G. Jéquier (l.c.) identi"ed either with Eg. grg “1. équiper, fonder” or Eg. grg “2. mensonge”, but neither of his far-fetched and morphologically erroneous suggestions for its primary mng. are really convincing (either “pour la vie éternelle” or “un vase pour le mensonge, i.e., un ustensile destiné à puri"er, à laver l’homme de cette faute, pour le péché” re#ecting “l’idée de l’eau lustrale qui lave les péchés et par là même donne la vie”).
mgrg “der Lügner (als Bez. des Seth)” (GR, Wb II 164, 13). ! Derived (with “participial” m-) from Eg. grg “Lüge” (end of OK, Wb V 189–190), cf. Grapow 1914, 32; Smith 1979, 163.
nb: The AA etymologies suggested for Eg. grg (probably *glg) > Cpt. (S) Col “Lüge”
(KHW 449) so far are accompanied by serious phonological obstacles. (1) Albright
(1918, 251, #113; cf. Ember 1930, #12.a.46, #23.b.3) equated Eg. grg with Ar. qrq
“tromper qqn., en imposer à qqn.” [BK II 722]. But Eg. g vs. Ar. q are not regular.
(2) Behnk’s (1928, 141, #60) comparison of Eg. grg vs. Masai le‰ “betrügen” is
out of question. (3) Reinisch (1887, 162) and Cohen (1947, #236) combined Eg.
grg with Bed. g$har “betrügen, (be)stehlen” [Rn. 1895, 93] !! NAgaw: Bilin gwåre%
“jmdn. unter listigen Vorspiegelungen ausbeuten, hintergehen, betrügen” [Rn.] =
“tromper” [Chn.] !! LECu.: Saho-Afar gwåreh-it (re#.) “aussinnen eine List”, g(w)århÉ
“Tücke, Betrug, Hinterlist”, gwårãh “Hinterlist, Tücke, Verschlagenheit” [Rn. 1890,
164]. But Cu. *-% is incompatible with Eg. -g. Cp. also CCh.: Musgu argú0 “Lügner,
lügenhaft” [Rohlfs apud Lks. 1941, 45]. (4) Hintze (1951, 80) extended this Eg.-Cu.
comparison to NBrb.: Sus s-k5r2ks “mentir”, n.vb. ti-k2rkis-t, pl. ti-kerkäs [Dst. 1938,
184], Ntifa s-kirk2s “lügen” [Hintze]. Cf. also Tamazight s-karks “to tell lies” [Skn.
1971, 305]. But there is hardly any phonological agreement between the Cu. and
Brb. comparanda. There is not even one single common root consonant shared by
both Brb. *krks and Eg. *glg. (5) Mukarovsky (1987, 239) mentioned noteworthy
Ch. forms for “lie (Lüge)” in comparison with NMande: Soninke g3re “Lüge”, cf.
WCh.: Hausa =á‘ryáá “1. a lie, 2. (occasionally used for) a mistake, unintentional
lie” [Brg. 1934, 574] | Pa’a kwálì “lie”, nd2r kwali “to tell lie” [MSkn. 1979, 189]
mgrg



682
!! ECh.: Kwang kèla— “Lüge” [Mkr.] | Ndam "2 ma kÖrÜn “Lüge” [Mkr.]. But here
too, it is dif"cult to see regular consonant correspondences. For Hs. cf. also WCh.:
AS *=3r “to tamper with (a woman, another man’s "ancée)” [GT 2004, 202]: Angas
kaar “1. to tamper with (esp. of another man’s "ancée), 2. deceive” [Flk. 1915,
209] = káar “to talk to a girl not to marry her "ancé but oneself ” [ Jng. 1962 MS,
16], Gmy. =aar mat “to bring a young wife into her husband’s room on the third
day after their marriage” (mat “wife”) [Srl. 1937, 88]. Skinner (1971, 305) errone
ously related the Ch. forms to Brb. *)k-r-k-s (above). (6) Vycichl (1990, 106) linked
Eg. grg to Ar. 3ala9a “se tromper, commettre une erreur, une faute (en parlant, en
écrivant, dans le calcul), manquer” [BK II 492] = “lügen” (sic) [Vcl.], which is
equally unacceptable (there is just one single corresponding phoneme, namely -l-).
(7) Takács (2000, 88, #18.12) equated Eg. *glg (as partial redupl. of *gl) with ERift
*gil- [GT]: Asa gil- “to deceive”, gil-at “lie” (noun) [Ehret 1980, 364]. Cf. perhaps
also JAram. glg “plaudern”, galg3 “Geschwätz” [Dalman 1922, 78]?
mgs (GW) “Verbum von der Arbeit am Schurz einer Statue” (XX., Wb II 164, 15) = “ziseliert” (Helck, MWNR II 197) = “a metal working activity: to emboss, hammer (?)” (Hoch 1994, 153, §200). ! D. Meeks (1997, 43, §229) demonstrated that of the two exx. of mgs suggested by Hoch that attested in Pap. Turin (P + R) 32:7 (= KRI VI 335: 12) is merely a wtg. of mks “sceptre” (cf. Wb II 164 and Hoverstreydt 1997, 110, n. g; Woodhouse 2003, 280, §229: “document case”). Whether mgs of Pap. Turin (P + R) 32:5 (= KRI VI 335:9) represent the same word as msq of Pap. Koller 1:7 (for details cf. above) is dubious.
mgsp (GW, pl.) “crates made of palm-sticks” (XIX. hapax: Pap. Chester Beatty V vs. 1:11, Blackman 1936, 104, cf. HPBM III, 49, n. 9) = “cageot” (AC 1978, 14; AL 78.1896) = “crate” (DLE I 250) = “create, basket” (Hoch) = “*Kisten” (GHWb 373) = “Lattenkiste” (WD II 68).
nb: Syllabic spelling: ma-ga-sa-pa (Hoch).
! Origin uncertain. Looks to be a Semitic loan-word with an m- pre"x, but the source has not yet been satisfacorily identi"ed. " 1. A. M. Blackman (1930, 104) suggested that it “perhaps” might be related (with met.) to Ar. qafa)a “to tie the legs (of a gazelle), put things together”, qaf)- “lattice-work”, qafa)- “(the ordinary word for) crate made of palm-sticks in modern Egypt”, which in Blackman’s view “denoted exactly the same kind of crate used in Egypt ” not only in the Ramesside period, but from “immemorial times”. But as rightly pointed out by J. Hoch (l.c.), this comparison is doubtful phonologically. There is no agreement between Can. *-)- and Eg. -s- (Blackman would have expected Eg. -2-!), and the same is valid for Ar. q vs. Eg. g (contra Ember 1930, 106 referred to by Blackman).

" 2. J. Hoch (1994, 173–4, §230) reconstructed LEg. *maga2apa (?) assuming that it is perhaps akin to MHbr. k.peš “basket (for olives)”, k2p5š3 “a vessel with a bottom compartment”, cf. also kpt “to twist, tie”, k2p3t3 “travelling implements tied up, bundle” (with Aram. -t< *-2-). Unconvincing.
mgg (GW?) or mg3g3 (?) “(Verbum)” (GR hapax, Wb II 164, 16: Edfu Mammisi, cf. Chassinat 1939, 115) = “ululation (?)” (Smith 1979, 163) = “hurlement, lamentation” (AL 79.1397) = “cri, hululement” (Cauville 1987, 184). ! H. Smith (1979, 163) explained it as an pre"x m- derivative of Eg. g3g3 “to cackle (of goose)” (Pap. Westcar 8:23) = “schnattern (der Gans)” (Wb V 157, 2).
nb: S. Cauville (1987, 184) extended this etymology to a number of Eg. onomatopo
etic forms: pgg “grenouille” (Cauville) = “ein Tier, dessen «mm of"zinell verwendet
wird” (Med., Wb I 563, 8), pngg “petit animal: grenouille (?)” (Cauville), ngg “crier,
tinter” (Cauville) = “1. schreien (Falken), 2. klirren (Sistrum), 3. erschallen lassen (?)
(Stimme)” (PT, Wb II 350, 9–12). Doubtful. Eg. pgg.t can hardly belong here, cf.
EDE II 528. For Eg. ngg there is good AA etymology, which indicates that *n- was
part of the root.
mt “sterben” (OK, Wb II 165–6) > Dem. mwt “sterben” (DG 157) > Cpt. (OSALBF) mou “sterben” (KHW 87).
nb1: Although written regularly as mt (and listed so in dictionaries), the root was
originally probably *mwt. E. Edel (AÄG 64, §145) reaf"rmed the exceptional early
Dyn. VI exx. of writing med. -w- (PT 676bT) and -j- (PT 657eT) quoted already
in Wb II 165. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33), followed by G. Lefébvre (CdE 11, 1936, 279),
W. Vycichl (1938, 148), and Ch. Cannuyer (1983, 28), supposed Cpt. mouou« to
represent a piel (pi««1l) stem (quasi *s33m), i.e., *mVwwVt (Vycichl: with -t “durch
Systemzwang geblieben”), which was rightly queried by W. C. Till (1937, 133), who
argued that we are dealing here rather perhaps with the two (intr./tr.) types of the
Cpt. inf. following the pattern of (S) μkaH “sich kränken” vs. mouk=H “quälen”
(pointing out GR exx. with a secondary tr. mng. “to kill”). For the problem cf. also

ap: With special regard to Eg. mt “sterben”, hence “zu Grunde gehen: vom unterge
henden Schiff ” (MK, Wb II 166, 7) = “to perish (of boat), sink” ( Jones 1988, 215,
#37), Mukarovsky (1957, 138–9; 1959, 15, #23; 1994, 152) related AA *m-w-t (Eg.
mt) with Ful m$t-de “sinken, untergehen (von der Sonne oder einem Boot)”, mut
al “Untergang”, WAtl.: Bolante mota “auslöschen”, Temne mota “sinken (Schiff,
Stein), tauchen, untergehen (Sonne)”. Elderkin (1982, 79), in turn, combined Ch.
*m-t “to die” with Hadza misi “to die”.
dp: A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1967, 281) explained the AA root from Nst. *mut2
“1)2!"83*.':” based on Tungus-Mandju *muda “1)2!"83*.':”, Drv. *m$9-/*mu92
mt



691
“2!"8)*.':”. S. A. Starostin et al. (1995, 4) af"liated the AA root with Alt. *m$tei
“complete”, Drv. *mu9- “to end, be completed”, and ST *met “to perish”.
nb1: N. Skinner (1995, 30) erroneously reconstructed a certain AA *m-w/y- “1. to
die, 2. hunger” based on the mostly false comparison of a number of unrelated
comparanda like Ch. *m-y “hunger” vs. *k-m “corpse”, WCh.: NBch. *miy- “to die”
vs. *m(w)ay- “hunger”, Eg. mnj “to die” (original mng. “to moor”!), Bed. misis
“to die natural death (animal)”, miti “to dissolve, melt” and a number of further
absurd parallels.
nb2: Brb. *-mm- < *-mw- was regular, cf. Brb. *2-ss2n “to know” ~ Eg. swn as rightly
pointed out by E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 93) and F. Hintze (1953, 36–37 & fn. 48). The
latter author was, however, of the view that “möglicherweise ist -t im Berberischen eine
Stammerweiterung”, while in Sem. and Eg. it was not (cf. contra Zyhlarz 1932–33, 94
and Cohen 1947, 192, #488: “toutefois dans certains dialectes -t est traité comme suf!xe”).
Uncritically following Ch. Ehret (1995, 312), P. Vernus (2000, 175 & fn. 48) made
an obscure statement that “en couchitique, le t n’est pas intégré à la racine”. N. Skinner
(1977, 18, fn. 54) too assumed that *-t was a suf"x in NBch.
nb3: Not too many evident traces of AA *m-w-t in Cu. Note that LECu.: Somali
m.d- and Somali-Isaq mot- “death” were borrowed from Ar. (Dlg. 1973, 246). Fol
lowing R. Hayward (p.c.), H.-J. Sasse (1982, 148) related AA *)m-w-t to HECu.:
Burji mot-3 “lame”, mot-um- “to be paralyzed, dislocated” and Orm. a-mut-3
“mourning”. Ch. Rabin (1982, 30, fn. 4), in turn, was disposed to compare also
the homophonous Cu. root for “to pierce”/”to eat”.
nb4: No evident cognates in Om. either. Cf. perhaps NOm.: Gamu met-ó “1. lack,
2. trouble”, meto-t- “to lack” [Lmb. 1985 MS, #521–2] | Yemsa ( Jnj.) mett- “to
be sick” [Lmb. 1996, 334]?
(*)mt: an old word which may be reconstructed from the phon. value of the hrgl. depicting a “phallus” (EG 1927, 448, D52) = “le phallus ou le mâle” (Lacau 1912, 72, §6) = “pénis (un mot, qui a très vraisemblablement existé, mais il a disparu)” (Lacau 1952, 9, §7 & fn. 3) = “Hieroglyphenbild des erigierten Phallus” (Grapow 1954, 21) = “eine alte, wohl etikettierende Bezeichnung des Phallus (nur als Phonogramm belegt)” (Behrens, LÄ IV 1019, n. 5) > Dem. mt “phallus” (DG 184).
nb1: This may be considered – pace P. Lacau (l.c.) – a word “qui appartenait au vieux
fond de la langue”. I. M. D’jakonov (1965, 42) treated it as an attested lexeme, although
W. W. Müller (1968, 365) also warned that “mt ‘Phallus’ ist im Ägyptischen als Wort
unbekannt, nur als Schriftzeichen (belegt)”. Nevertheless, P. Lacau (1970, 81) maintains
to have identi"ed the word in PT 601: j«j %r n N jn n2r.w m . . . (three phallus hrgls.
+ -w) m %m.wt “le visage de N. est lavé par les dieux et comme mâles et comme
femelles” (Lacau) = “my face is washed by the gods, male and female” (AEPT 116).
But here, the phallus hrgl. has to be read rather as 23j. A. H. Gardiner (1957, 52,
fn. 2), followed by W. A. Ward (1972, 21, #209), in turn, thought to have found a
“unique” MK occurrence of mt “phallus” (“perhaps the otherwise unrecorded word from
which the sign takes its phonetic value”) in Pap. Ramesseum VI 71(?), 96 (cf. WD II 69).
But R. Hannig (ÄWb II 1153) lists a signi"cant number of its further MK (mostly
CT) occurences as a Kunstwort.
nb2: Whether mt.wt “1. männliche Same, 2. (bildlich) Sohn” (PT, Wb II 169,
1–3) originated from the same root is uncertain. J. Zeidler (1984, 47) seems to
have preferred deriving Eg. *mt “phallus” from mt.wt “sperm” (not vice versa). This
does not necessarily contradict to the etymology of Eg. *mt suggested below (Sem.
(*)mt

*mut- “man” etc.). Note that H. Grapow (1954, 86) maintained an etymological
connection between Eg. mt.wt “semen” and mt.wt “poison” (supposing that Egyp
tians conceived sperm as poisonous).

Several authors (e.g., Lsl. 1949, 315; Hintze 1951, 86; Blz. 1990, 265; Takács 1997, 372, #a) suggested an etymological connection of Eg. *mt “phallus” (and its Cu.-Om. parallels) with the re#exes of AA *m2t “man, husband” [Djk.] = *mut- “man, male” [GT]. Thus, Eg. *mt has been usually equated (also) with Sem. *mut- “man, warrior” [Hnrg. 1995, 2128; 2000, 2065] = *mut- “man, husband” [Fox 1998, 15; Djk.-Kogan 2001, 151, §2.1]: Akk. mutu “(Ehe)Mann” [AHW 690] < OAkk. mutum “mate, husband” [Gelb 1973, 186] (misquoted in HSED #1806, cf.

I. M. Diakonoff & L. Kogan (2001, 151, §2.1) af"liated Geez m2t with Ar. matta

chercher à s’allier dans la famille de qqn.”, mat3t- “lien par lequel on tient à la
famille de qqn.”, m3tt-at- “lien d’alliance ou de parenté” [BK II 1055]. But already
L. H. Gray (1934, 41) reconstructed the primary sense of PSem. *mut- as “mortal,
man”, evidently referring to Sem. *mwt “to die”. V. Bla&ek (1990, 265–266) and V.
Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED #1806) too, have suggested a relationship of PAA *m-w-t
“to die” vs. PAA *mut- “man” with special regard to the typological parallel found
in PIE *mer- “to die” > i.a. Indo-Iranian-Gk.-Arm. isogloss *mor-to- “man”.

explained as a metathesis from an earlier **a-wm2t.

M. Lamberti (1988, 69, §179; 1993, 105; 1993, 288; HL 1988, 129) derived
HECu.-NOm. *mut- “penis” from his “OCu.” (PCu.-Om.) *bu*-/*mu*- “to sprout,
spring” based on the phonologically dubious comparison of thise root with Bed.

Yemsa bur’a “penis”, and NOm.: Sns. b1ca (-ts-) “penis”.

for “family” (above) with NOm. *m#à''- “Frau” [GT], which he explained from
OCu. *may- “weiblich(es Wesen)” [Lsl.].

imet “people” [Dlg.] (WRift: Dempwolff 1916–17, 310, #56; Dlg. 1973, 176) is
also rather unlikely, while LECu.: Afar ummat (f ) “inhabitants, populace, people”
[PH 1985, 204] is evidently a borrowing from Ar. "umm-at- “1. assemblée, foule,
multitude, 2. famille, 3. peuple, nation” [BK I 52].
nb6: The etymology of the Ch. forms has been disputed. Lukas 1968, 104: Hausa
mùtûm < Ch. *1m-t-n! N. Pilszczikowa (1958, 78, §16 & fn. 12), rejecting M. Cohen’s
(l.c.) equation of Hs. mutum with Sem. *mut- and Eg. *mt (which she erroneously
combined with Hs. mi‰i “homme, mari”), compared the Hs. word rather with WCh.:
Dera mu and Bole memu, which she supposed to originate from “une jonction de mu
et tun” identi"ed by her with a certain “Nilo-Hamitic” (sic) nyetu,nunan, while Hs.
mu- “serait un pré!xe d’une ancienne classe humaine” comparable with Hs. -tun of the same
mng. (acc. to Delafosse). Similarly, H. Jungraithmayr & K. Shimizu (1981, 147A2
and 202A1–2) explained PCh. *m-z, *m-n, *m-m, *m-r “man (vir), male, husband,
person” from PCh. *m-. Later, however, H. Jungraithmayr & D. Ibriszimow (1994
I, 98, 114–115, 134–135) set up an original PCh. *m-t-m “husband, man, person”
remarking that the third radical *-m is re#ected only in Hausa, elsewhere a root
*m-t is attested with C3 “apocopated ” (whence they took also WCh.: Tng. muu and
Jimi ma as well as the ECh.: Sokoro and Dangla comparanda listed above, in which
C3 “has been clipped ”). JI (1994 I, 135) did not exclude that “originally R1 and R3 of our
root [i.e., PCh. *m-t-m] would have been class markers in an ambi!xal class language system
m- + -t- + -m”. This hypothesis has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Already

R. M. Voigt (1998, 612) correctly separated Ch. *m-t from Ch. *m-n. The same
applies to Ch. *m-z vs. *m-r vs. *m-, which represent diverse unrelatedAA roots.
nb7: R. M. Voigt (1998, 612–3) af"liated Ch. *m-t-m “Mann” (attested in fact only
in Hausa) with Ar. matuna “stark sein”, which he separated from bicons. Ch. *m-t
(Sokoro) ~ Sem. *mut- and Eg. *mt “phallus” (explained by him eventually from
the AA root re#ected by Eg. wmt “dick sein”).

nb4: The etymology of Bed. m5d has been debated. L. Reinisch (l.c.) compared it
with LECu.: Afar bu**É “das männliche Schamglied” and even m3» “coire”, while
E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 168) connected it rather with Eg. m23 “penis” (below). A.B.
Dolgopol’skij (1967, 8, #4) too, combined Bed. m5* (sic) with HECu.: Sidamo
mutã “membrum virile” and Eg. m2 (sic) “penis”. But the etymology of Eg. m23 is
disputed (see below). E. Haberland and M. Lamberti (1988, 129) too, derived Bed.
mid “penis” from an OCu. *mu*/t- “sexual organ” erroneously based on LECu.:
SA bu**e “penis”, Orm. bi99o" “penis”, Gdl. mi"-no “penis” and (!) be9ere “vagina”,
Baiso manto “penis” | HECu.: Burji misa “penis”, Sid. & Had. muta “penis”, Kmb.
mu9uro “vagina” !!! NOm.: Zala & Dache mute “vagina”, Yemsa bur’a “penis”.
nb5: The etymology of Brb. *midd-2n “gens” is also dubious. Its direct comparison
with WCh.: Hausa mutum !!! Eg. *mt !!! Sem. *mut- (above) is doubtful (phonologi
cally also), although it has been frequent in the lit., cf. Halévy (quoted by Prv. 1911,
117); Bst. 1885, 169; Lippert 1906, 341, §20; Wlf. 1955, 37; Lacau 1970, #213;

son was rejected already by Provotelle (1911, 117), who saw in the Berber word

a pl. form “dérivée avec la terminaison du pluriel d’une” Brb. *)* or *)d > NBrb.: Swy.
iu*-an ~ iud-an, Sened u*-un, Djerba & Nfs. iud-an ~ ida “les gens”. Similarly,
V. Bla&ek (2002, 129, #23.2) analyzed Brb. *)m-"-d (sic) “man” as a compound
of *)d + pre"x *m-.
nb6: It is just as well improbable that LECu.: Dasenech & Arbore *mVd- “man”
would be directly related with PCh. *m-t “man” [GT] (as proposed by H. G.
Mukarovsky 1989 MS, 5). The derivation of the Chadic forms for “man, person”
with *-d- from PCh. *m-t (with *-t-) seems to be commonly accepted in comparative
Chadic linguistics (cf., e.g., JI 1994 I 98, 115: Ch. *m-t-m > Birgit mìdìwó [ Jng.]
via *mitimo etc.; Lukas 1968, 104, 223: Bade "mldÖn < *mùtún). But both the inner
Chadic and the AA evidence speaks for two distinct root vars. (*m-t vs. *m-d).
nb7: The equation of WCh.: Hausa mí‰ì (sg.), mázáá (pl.) “1. male, 2. husband” [Abr.
1962, 671, 697] etc. with Sem. *mut- !!! Eg. *mt etc. (suggested by N. Pilszczikowa
1960, 123, #122 and I. M. D’jakonov 1974, 742) is phonologically incorrect. In this
case, one can hardly derive Hs. -‰i from *-di. The etymological interpretation of this
Ch. word is dubious (for details and the problem cf. Eg. mš« “Heer” above).
! Other etymologies for Eg. *mt are either less convincing or evidently false: " 3. H. Grapow (1954, 21) assumed that the “Hieroglyphenbild des erigierten Phallus . . ., der ja zugleich ein längliches Hohlgefäß ist . . .” was primarily “ein elastischer Strang . . .”, since “vielleicht hat der Ägypter sich die mt-Gefäße usw. ähnlich gebaut vorgestellt ”. This hypothesis maintaining the ultimate link of Eg. *mt “phallus” to mt “Gefäß des menschlichen Körpers” (Med., Wb, below) was uncritically adopted by J. Osing (2001, 578–9) and rejected by G. Takács (2005, 52, #4.22; 2005, 643–4, #20). " 4. L. Homburger (1930, 285) compared it with Ful -di ~ -ri “suf"xe de noms de mâle”. Absurd. " 5. E. Zyhlarz (1934, 110, #5) combined Eg. *mt “phallus” with Common Brb. *ta-m299-ut “woman”.
nb1: This Berber word has been af"liated also with the re#exes of AA *m-9 “to copulate
with a woman” [GT], which is equally dubious (cf. the following item of this entry).
nb2: Brb. *ta-m299-ut “woman” has nothing to do with Brb. *midd-2n (above) as
proposed by J. Bynon (1984, 276, #39).
" 6. M. Cohen (1947, #476) af"liated Eg. *mt (also) with NBrb.: Qabyle m9a “conjoint”, which is to be separated from the rest of his comparanda.

nb3: Ar. m9" & m9w “cohabiter avec une femme” [BK] is not necessarily related
with Brb. *ta-m299-ut “woman” as supposed by W. Vycichl (1990, 80–81).
nb4: Despite the suggestion by a number of authors (Hintze 1951, 85–86; Militarev
1984, 158; Bla&ek 1991, 362), it is not clear whether SBrb.: Ahaggar té-mi9 and
HECu.: Som. mi*-o can be related with Brb. *ta-m299-ut “woman”. Note that the
Som. word derives from ECu. *mi*- “fruit, seed” [Sasse 1979, 29; Heine 1978, 69]
< PCu. *mA9- “1. 9&!( (fruit), 2. E0+: (seed)” [Dlg. 1973, 250], for which cf. Eg.
mt.wt “der männliche Same” (PT, Wb, below) = “seed” (FD).
" 7. A. M. Lam (1993, 379): ~ Ful Hotte “testicules, sexe”. Absurd. " 8. GT: an alternative comparison to Ug. m9 “1. Stab, 2. virga virilis” [WUS #1551] (for lit. on the 2nd mng. v. DL 2003, 166, fn. 129) is impossible for a number of reasons.
nb: The Ug. term, which has recently been rendered as “rod, staff, riding crop”
[DUL 602], is to be compared to Hbr. ma99eh that is usually explained from *)n9w,
which, however, cannot be related to Eg. *mt (for further details cf. Eg. mdw below).
In addition, the alleged sense “phallus, penis” of Ug. m9 has been most recently
disproved by M. Dietrich & O. Loretz (2003, 166–9).

nb1: The preservation of Cpt. -t indicates a lost second syllable and a "nal (C3)
consonant not written in hrgl. (*-j or *-w), cf. XIX. pl. mtj.w (quoted in Wb II
167). W. Westendorf (l.c.) assumed an old *mtj or *mtw and found a further proof
con"rming the Auslautvokal of LEg. *mãt'(C3) in the Tale of Woe 1:12 (Caminos
1977, 11) where mt is written as md.t.

1984, 74) = *m3tej/w, pl. *matj/w-$ (DELC 124).

expressed a.o. in Pap. E.Smith 3:18 mt.w mr p%.wj wg.t( j)=fj mj 3d w3.t 0.t m
zš “the ligaments which bind the end of his jaw as one says, ’the cord’ of a thing

nb4: The pl. of the same lexeme is re#ected by Cpt. (S) mote, (F) maT, (M) mate,
(B) moT (m) “1. neck, shoulders, joint, 2. sinew, bowstring” (CD 189a) = “Hals,
Nacken, Schulter, Gelenk” (Till 1955, 328; KHW 103), which K. Sethe & A. H.
Gardiner (1910, 43) explained from *m!twej. Although W.C. Till (1955, 328, §26
pace CD 189a) maintained both (S) mout vs. mote to be “miteinander verwandt”,
he admitted that “seine Herkunft ist unbekannt” (!).
nb5: For the etymological connection of the forms meaning “sinew” vs. “neck”
speak a number of facts: (1) the occurence of Eg. mt in the expression “Band am
Nacken” (Wb II 167, 13); (2) CT VII 43: mt n 00=f “duct (?) in his neck” rendered
by R. O. Faulkner with hesitation (“what it means in this context is not clear ”) as a term
referring to “a blood-vessel to be cut after the stunning or the windpipe which is
to be strangled” (AECT III 27–28, spell 839, n. 13); (3) typological parallels like
ECu. *mur=- “gristle” [Ss.] > Orm. morg-aya “tendon, nerve”, Arb. morgi “tendon,
sinew”, Som. muruq “muscle (Rn.: die sehnigen Bestandteile am Oberarm oder an
den Waden, Muskeln)”, Yaaku mor‰-i" “sinew of neck” (ECu.: Sasse 1982, 148; HL
1988, 129; Lmb. 1988, 88, #130; LS 1997, 466). Nevertheless, pre-Cpt. *mãt' “neck”
might be alternatively combined with ECh.: Barein maato “Hals” [Lks. 1937, 51],
whose wider Ch. etymology is still obscure (cf. Takács 2005, 52, fn. 136).
nb6: J. Osing (NBÄ 321, 866, n. 1381) explained Cpt. (L) moome (m) “Ader” from
*måmt'( j) (via *må"m'), which he regarded as the partial reduplication of mtj (cf.
Fecht 1960, §206f ). Cf. also Eg. *mm.t (?) above.

besides, in fact Áaggw-ið- [Ehret 1980, 223; EEN 1989, 30]. Therefore, the sexual
connotation in both Dhl. and Ar. mut«-at- “enjoyment”, mat3«- “a woman’s puden

nb2: The primary meaning of the PSem. word has been disputed. It has been
almost generally accepted in Semitology (e.g. Holma 1911, 6, fn. 3; Lsl. 1945, 236;
1958, 32; 1987, 372; Frz. 1964, 268, #2.40; AHW 633) that Akk. matnu and its

H. Holma (1911, 6, fn. 3) in setting up a common PSem. basic mng. “Hüftsehne”.
Accordingly, the PSem. term has been reconstructed as *matan- “1. hip, haunch,
2. tendon, nerve” [Blv. etc. 1994, #68] = *ma/utn- “1. partie de dos; 2. loins”
[Mlt. in Sts. etc. 1995, 3]. But already J. Aistleitner (WUS #1524 vs. #1712) and
mt



702
W. Leslau (1969, 20) seem to have made a "ne distinction between the two basic
senses of Sem. *matn-. L. Kogan and A. Militarev (SED I 173, §191), in turn,
assumed two different and etymologically unrelated PSem. anatomical terms, namely
*matn- “1. sinew, tendon, 2. nerve” vs. *matn- “hip, loin”, which they also found
“semantically dif!cult to compare” assuming that “a semantic contamination with metathetic
*mV(")n-(at)- ‘tendon, sinew; muscle’ . . . is possible” (unlikely). The basic sense may be
closer Aram. mitn3 ~ mutn3 “Strich” [WUS].
nb3: Already A. S. Tritton (1933–35, 597) surmised (rightly) the Sem. biconsonantal

nb1: V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED 385, #1776) combined Sem. *m99 with CCh.:
Mtk. mit, which, however, seems to derive rather from AA *m-t (above).
nb2: J. Blau (IOS 2, 1972, 68, n. 3) compared Ar. m9w with Geez ma99awa “to
hand over, deliver, give over etc.” [Lsl.]. But the etymology of the Geez verb is
disputed. Th. Nöldeke (ZDMG 40, 1886, 736, fn. 5) explained it as an assim. from
an earlier *"am93, cognate to Ar. "an93 “to give” (in which Landberg 1942, 2786
saw a contamination of Ar. "a«93 vs. "and3 “to bring”). W. Leslau (1987, 374), in
turn, combined it rather with Aram. m293 peal “to attain, reach”, pael “to bring”
Sqt. m9y “to attain” etc.
nb3: A. R. Bomhard (1981, 448) af"liated Ar. m99 (above) and m9l “to expand, draw
out, lengthen, stretch” with IE *med- “to measure”, for which (in the frames of the
Nst. hypothesis) Sem. *mdd (below) would "t much better.
nb4: Mkl. "ón*è may be alternatively compared to Ar. n9y, which has been con
nected in GB 913 (pace Nöldeke, ZDMG 40, 736) to BA m9" peal “1. wohin
reichen, sich erstrecken, 2. wohin gelangen, 3. (an)kommen”, for which, cf. Eg.
*mtj below.
" 3. GT: in addition, there was also a var. root with *-d, cf. AA *m-d “to stretch” [GT] (whose re#exes are discussed s.v. Eg. mdd infra).
mt.wt “1. der männliche Same, 2. (bildlich für) Sohn” (PT, Wb II 169, 1–3) = “1. seed (CT, Med.), 2. ("g.) seed, progeny (PT, Urk. IV)” (FD 121).
nb: The existence and rdg. of mt.w(t)-k3 “als Synonym von m3«.t (’Wahrheit’)” (GR:
1x in Philae, Wb II 169, 4) has been con"rmed by D. Kurth (1984, 273f.) with further
exx. from GR temples and a discussion of the aspects of this expression.
! Etymology disputed. " 1. K. Sethe (ÜKAPT II 207) explained it from an unattested Eg. *mt “männlich” (“von dem” the phallus hrgl. “den Lautwert mt haben muß”). Similarly, Sh. Yeivin (1936, 71, §17) connected it with Eg. *mt “phallus” and Sem. *mut- “husband” (sic, discussed above), which was (rightly) doubted by W. Vycichl (DELC 125) and P. Lacau (1912, 76) viewing that its writing with the phallus (mt) hrgl. “c’est une pure coïncidence”. For E. A. Knauf (1984, 18) “weniger glücklich scheint . . . der Versuch, den Zusammenhang zwischen äg. mt.wt Same vs. akkad. mutum, äth. m/t Ehemann zu bestreiten”.
" 2. H. Grapow (1954, 86), in turn, maintained an etymological connection with Eg. mt.wt “Gift” (below), supposing Egyptians to have considered sperm poisonous. This is, however, only possible if we assume that the primary sense was “seed”. " 3. GT: perhaps related to ECu. *mA9- “1. 9&!( (fruit), 2.

376; ÄWb I 574) suggest an original spelling *mtr.t (for the problem cf. below).
nb2: The PT 285b instance was translated in Wb II 168, 2 as “Eignung” < mtj
“richtig” (q.v.). J. Osing (NBÄ 650, n. 673), in turn, has rendered Eg. mt.t in Pap.
Rhind 64:2–3 and Pap. E. Smith 2:2 as *“das Richtige, Richtiges, Eigentliche”

place a fem. adj. mtj.t “richtig”).
nb3: It is tempting to combine it with K. Sethe’s mt (sic) “Eingeweide, Inneres” (PT
1367b, ÜKAPT VI 135), which seems, however, to be a ghost-word, now read as
4rmt “*Aufweg” (GHWb 643), which occurs also in PT 2015b (AEPT 214, n. 14

! Origin debated. " 1. In Eg. linguistics, it has been usually explained as a defective wtg. of *mtr.t (or a late orthography re#ecting the loss of *-r-), which has been etymologically connected with Eg. mtr.t (Vrg.: *mútr.at " *mú"ra) “Mittag” (Wb, below) = midday (FD) > (S) meere etc. (lit.
*“the middle”) and ultimately derived from the Eg. root traditionally conceived as mtr (sic, -r) “gerade in der Mitte sein” (Sethe) = mtr “(adj. of ) accuracy of the stand-balance” (Smith). But this latter root has recently been (correctly) reconstructed as mtj “richtig, gerade, genau” (Osing, cf. also Grd. 1917, 85; 1955, 195; NBÄ 643, n. 672; Snk. 1983, 225; Junge 2003, 225, n. 199). Moreover, the relationship of mtj “correct” vs. mt.t “middle” is semantically also doubtful.

nb: That the word was written in Dem. also as mtr.t proves hardly anything about
the original spelling of the underlying root just like Dem. mtr (!) ~ mtj “Tiefe,
Länge” (DG 191) < Eg. m3.wt “Tiefe” (MK, Wb, below). J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 36
& 139) eventually explained both Eg. mtr.t “midday” vs. mt.t “middle” from an old
Eg. etymon *mútr.at resulting in (apparently via Wortspaltung) *mú"r.a(t) “midday”
vs. *mút".a(t) > (via met.) *mú"t.a(t) “middle”, whose the cluster *-tr- > *-t"- would
be re#ected by (S) -hht-. J. Osing (NBÄ 649), in turn, regarded the derivation of
Eg. mt.t & Dem. mtj “Mitte” from an old Eg. fem. adj. mt( j).t (*mÉ/†t.'t) “richtig,
gerade, genau” as “sicher”, whence the word was “neugebildet” (!) in or before Dyn.
XVIII as mtr.t (*mÉ/†tr.'t) > “Mittag” (lit. “richtig, genau”!). H. S. Smith (1978,
360) conceived the basic sense of Eg. )mtr as an “adj. of accuracy of the stand
balance”, whence he took (S) mhte (no mention of mt.t).

! Other etymologies are out of question. " 3. H. Möller (1911, 66) derived it (and Eg. mtr.t “Mittag”) from Eg. jm “in(ter)” (!) compared with Sem. *matn- “Hüfte” (erroneously explained from an orig. mng. “Mitte”) as well as with IE *(e)m-t (sic) “mit”, IE *ent-r (sic) “inner” (from *émter) and even IE *médh-Êo-s “medius” (!). Clearly absurd. Similarly, A. R. Bomhard (1981, 446; 1984, 271, #273) combined Eg. mt.t (and mtw “with”, sic) with IE *m2t-/*met- “middle, i the midst of, with, among”. Both proposals ignore basic facts of the Eg. morphological analysis. " 4. L. Homburger (1930, 289): Eg. mtr (sic) “milieu” ~ Ful nder “dedans”. False. " 5. A. M. Lam (1993, 391): Eg. mt.t “affection” (sic) ~ Ful mette “affection morale”. Absurd.
mt “Zäpfchen o.ä. als Form in welcher zusammengesetzte Medikamente in After und Vulva eingeführt werden” (Med., Wb II 167, 15–16) = “Darmzäpfchen” (Grapow 1936, 39, §9) = “le suppositoire, un moyen utilisé dans le but de provoquer une simple exonération intestinale ré#exe, à la manière de nos suppositoires laxatifs?)” ( Jonckheere 1947, 65) = “bolus” (FD 120) = “Zäpfchen (für After, für Vagina)” (GHWb 373). ! GT: perhaps an extended sense of the extinct Eg. *mt “phallus” (above)?
nb: Especially noteworthy are the NOm. re#exes of HECu. *mut- “penis” [GT]

nb: Vocalized as *mity.at (Vcl.) = *mídw.at (Ray).
! Etymology highly disputed. Most likely seems #2. " 1. E. Dévaud (Muséon 36, 1923, 95, §83) projected an anachronistic Cpt. etymon *m-ato (sic, m- and -o) as its etymon (lit. “in multitude”), consisting of Eg. m (prep.) “in” + (SL) ato, (SF) ata, (B) qo, (L) to, (SF) ate- “Menge” (KHW 13). Absurd. " 2. J. ,erný (CED 93; KHW 499) sought its ancestor in Eg. r-mtr (adv.) “richtig, genau” (GR, Wb II 174, 1) = r-mtr (sic, -r) “correctly, accurately (lit. according to correctness)” (,erný) = “avec justesse, exactitude” (AL 77.1923), which seems to be the only semantically suitable etymology that could be offered on Eg. grounds, although the semantic shift from “correctly” to “greatly” has not been demonstrated by him with parallels. In addition, the underlying Eg. root was mtj (not mtr, cf. below). " 3. Its derivation from “some form of ” (Ray) Eg. m3«.(t) that J. ,erný
(l.c. supra) and J. D. Ray (l.c. infra) also referred to is “phonetically dif!cult to accept ” (Ray) and is clearly a contamination (DG 149, 190). " 4. W. Vycichl (DELC 43) maintained that it re#ects “certainment un composé” of Cpt. (S) e- “à” + mate “atteindre, jouir”, (m) “succès” < Eg. *mtj which he ultimately explained (with hesitation) from Eg. mtr “être présent” (via an unattested sense “rendre présent”!). Semantically unconvincing. " 5. J. D. Ray (1999, 193, n. c), in turn, surmised that Dem. n-md.t (sic, -d-) “in any way” in Pap. Leiden I 382, rt. 5 (from Eg. mdw “to speak”) represents “perhaps the ancestor” of the Cpt. expression, and regarded it as possible that “two or more different etymologies merged in Coptic”.
" 6. GT: if, however, the inner Eg. etymology (#2) proves incorrect, the resemblance of the hypothetic pre-Cpt. *mt.t or *md.t “multitude (?)” to AA *m-t ~ *m-d “many” [GT] may be perhaps not fully illusory.

[Saadiah] = “strength of iron” [Ibn Ezra], JAram. ma9l3 “Stange” [GB; Dalman 1922, 232] = m293l “geschmiedete Stange” vs. ma9l3n3 “eiserne Stange” [Levy 1924 III 88, 90] = m293l “javelin for thrusting” [ Jastrow 1950, 767] = (Targum) ma9l(3n)3 “javelin (of iron)” [Rabin].
nb: The etymology of the Hbr.-Aram. word is so very much disputed that it cannot
be surveyed and evaluated here in full. H. Lewy (1895, 131f.) saw in it a borrowing
from Gk. μ+%)449". L. Koehler (KB) af"liated it with Ar. ma9ala “forger, étendre,
aplatir à coups de marteau (le fer, etc. pour faire un casque, etc.)” [BK II 1123] =
ma9ala “to beat iron into sheats”, ma95l-at- “tin” [Rabin]. C. H. Gordon (1965, §19,
#1037), J. Aistleitner (WUS #1118), and G. R. Driver (1956, 151a), in turn, equated
it with Ug. 9ll “to fall” or alternatively with Ug. mdl “lightning” (Gordon 1965, §19,
#1430; WUS #744a; Driver 1956, 161a; de Moor, ZAW 78, 69f.). Ch. Rabin (1963,
131, §15 & fn. 2–3), admitting that it “looks like” a derivative of Can. *n9l > Samar.
Aram. n9"lh “pole, bar” (- HBr. mo9), JAram. (Targum) "an9el ~ "a99el “to throw”,
surmised “an ellipsis of two different roots”, i.e., a contamination with a supposed cor
respondence of Akk. mutallu “noble, proud” (cf. Landsberger, JCS 8, 1954, 131–3
against Soden, Or. 22, 1953, 200f.) and Ar. rum% mitall “a strong spear” (normally
deriuved from Ar. talla, i.e., “a spear thrown on the ground”), which he eventually
explained from Hitt. & Luwian & HH muwat(t)alli- “strong (esp. of weapons)” (cf.
also Güterbock, ArOr 18/1–2, 216). Note that JAram. ma9l3n3 has been rendered
entirely differently by Dalman and Jastrow l.c.
" 3. GT: or cf. perhaps AA *m-t-l “to cast” [GT]?
nb1: Reconstruction highly uncertain as the common origin of its supposed deriva

nb2: As D. Appleyard (p.c. on 24 March 2007) con"rmed, C. Conti Rossini’s “Awiya”
and “Damot” forms “look blatantly like the Amharic verbal noun (in!nitive, nomen actionis)
mä9al from the verb 9alä ‘throw, throw away, drop’. However, mä9al is simply the verbal noun
‘to throw’ in Amharic, and the Amharic word for ‘sling’ (= It. !onda) is from an entirely different
root: wänæïf. The Amharic nomen instrumentalis from 9alä is mä9aya and this means ‘a place
where you throw things, a dump, rubbish tip’!”.
nb3: Akk. mudulu “eine Stange” [AHW 667] seems to be of Sum. origin (cf. OL

tora, Koyra t(ra (SEOmt.: Sbr. 1994, 20) | Sns. tora “spear” [Alm.] is rather
doubtful. Most of these forms look like borrowings ultimately originating from ES:
Amh. 9or “spear” [Apl.], which D. Appleyard (1977, 55/97) explained either from
ES *)wr > Geez )orä “to carry”, )or “burden, load” or Gafat )äwwärä “strong,
rigid”, although neither of these etymologies may be regarded as semantically
satisfactory. D. Appleyard (p.c., 24 March 2007) found a parallel for the semantic
shift for Geez )or “burden, load” > Amh. 9or in Tigrinya )or “burden, load”, pl.
)orat ~ var. "a)war “arms, soldier’s equipment”.
! Other suggestions are unacceptable. " 7. G. Jéquier (1911, 61, §18) treated it as the NK form of MK m33.t “(pl.) les bois autour desquels on arrimait les cordages, crochets, bittes ou taquets” (below). Excluded (MK -3- can hardly yield NK -t-). Later, however, Jéquier (1921 l.c.) regarded its origin to be unknown. " 8. A. A.-H. Youssef (1983, 259) combined Eg. mt3j.t with Ar. mudyat- “couteau” [BK II 1079], which is excluded both as a genetic parallel (Eg. -t- vs. Ar. -d- irreg., while Eg. -3- + Ar. -y) and as an Eg. > Ar. (via Cpt.) borrowing. " 9. G. Takács (1996, 52, #58; 1996, 127, #58; 1996, 136, #31) preferred to af"liate Eg. mt3.w on a biconsonantal basis with Eg. mtpn.t “Dolchscheide” (MK, Wb, q.v.), mtf.t “Art Dolch” (MK, Wb, q.v.),
mt3.w



714
and even mtnj.t “Art Beil” (MK, Wb, q.v.). Unconvincing in each case, since all of these comparanda presumably represent m- pre"x nomina instr.
mtj (n z3) “Vorsteher (einer Priestergilde, bei Handwerkerphylen)” (OK, Wb II 168, 10–14; GHWb 374) = “Leiter (einer Phyle)” ( Junker: Giza VI 21) = “chef (d’un collège)” (Pirenne apud Jones) = “Phylenobmann” (Kees 1948, 81–90 with discussion) = “controller (of a priestly phyle)” (FD 121; Ward 1982, 96, #803) = “regulator (of a phyle)” (Fischer 1996, 8, n. 5 & 227, 251; Jones 2000, 452, #1694) = “Phylenobmann, Regulator, Leiter (einer Priesterphyle, auch bei Handwerkerphylen)” (ÄWb I 573).

nb2: Was Mer. *mete “Phylarch” [Zhl. 1956, 26] = mte “ein Titel” [Hintze 1951,
359] borrowed from Eg. mtj?
nb3: It is not clear what evidence Brb. *mete (sic) “Libyertitel”, lit. “Erster, Fürst”
[Zhl. 1950, 421, fn. 5] has been based on (considered by E. Zyhlarz to be “alt
bekannt”), but it can hardly anything to do with Eg. mtj.
! There are more possible ways of its etymologization: " 1. J. Osing (NBÄ 647, n. 672.3) eventually explained this title from Eg. mtj “richtig, rechtmäßig, ordentlich, genau” (MK, Wb, below). GT: perhaps a substantivized participle deriving from a verbal use of mtj with the sense “to direct” attested also in CT VII 14k mtr (for *mtj) “to steer (the bark) straight for (?) (the land)” (AECT III 7, spell 815, n. 4) and LEg. (hapax) mt “führen, leiten” (WD II 68 pace Gdk. in RdE 38, 1987, 73, n. 49; absent in Wb)? Uncertain.
nb1: Although the etymologically correct reading of the underlying root seems to
have been mtj, the wtg. mtr occurs at least twice in the late Dyn. XII (Kairo 1478
and 20536, Belegstellen ad Wb II 168, 11; the latter ex. was quoted by Osing l.c.
as Kairo 20526), which can only be explained as the in#uence of Eg. mtj (written
also mtr) “richtig”. However, it is noteworthy that the det. of accuracy (two "ngers,
EG 1927, 447, D50) regularly accompanying Eg. mtj “richtig” is typically missing in
all exx. of Eg. mtj (as title) listed by Wb, which makes the etymological connection
suggested by Osing at least suspicious.
nb2: The semantic shift would be plausible, cf. e.g. PIE *reX- “(gerade) richten etc.”
(i.a. OInd. Ójú- and Av. 2r2zu- “gerade recht”) vs. IE *r1X-s “König” (OInd. r3j- &
rãjan-, Lat. r1x, OIrish r5), cf. IEW 854–7.
" 2. GT: on the other hand, in principle, an AA etymology should be also accounted for, cp. perhaps Bed. mityãy, pl. mítyay (m) “Befehl, Gebot”, mityay “befehlen” [Rn. 1895, 176 with a phonologically unconvincing Sem. etymology] = mity3 “to describe” [Rpr. 1928, 219] !!! ECh.: Kwang-Modgel méti “Häuptling” [Lks. 1937, 97].
nb1: The origin of NAgaw: Bilin m3d [irreg. -d] “1. Aufsicht, Oberbefehl über
jemanden, 2. Aufseher” [Rn. 1887, 263] = mäd “responsibility” and “someone who
watches over other people’s work” [Ki#emariam Hamdé] is not clear. L. Reinisch

(l.c.) compared it with ES: Tigre m3z (not in LH) and Geez mä«adä, var. m2«dä
“to counsel, warn, exhort, admonish”, which D. Appleyard (p.c., 26 March 2007)
is disposed to rule out. W. Leslau (1987, 325) compared this ES root with Soqotri
ma«ad “to intend” and other Semitic terms from the root *)w«d. Appleyard assumes
that if Tigre m3z is a genuine form then Bilin -d comes from earlier *-z (a com
mon sound change in this language), and Tigre could have borrowed it from Bilin
before the z > d change.

nb1: Its distinction from mtr “bezeugen” (Wb, infra) and that the correct reading of
the root seems to be mtj have been pointed out or indicated in a number of works
(Grd. 1917, 85; 1927, 447, D50, fn. 2; 1955, 2–3; Fecht 1958, 116, fn. 1; FD 120;
NBÄ 150, 643–7, n. 672; AL 77.1922; AECT III 7, spell 815, n. 4; Snk. 1983, 225;
GHWb 373 and 375; Junge 2003, 225, n. 199). It does not read mtr as erroneously
indicated (or sometimes even suggested) in a few older and more recent works (Wb
II 173; Sethe 1923, 198; Alb. 1927, 218; Clc. 1936, #642; Clère 1938, 242; CED
78; Smith 1978, 360; Snk. 1983, 225 rather delusively; DELC 119; Mlt. 1984, 22;
Junge 1999, 353; DCT 189; WD II 69, III 58). The occasional wtg. of -r (CT VI
337j, VI 404e, VII 14k, cf. DCT 189–190 & ÄWb II 1154; the NK exx. are quoted
in the Belegstellen ad Wb l.c.; WMT 412: Pap. Ramesseum III D 3:2?) may be
due to the in#uence of Eg. mtr “zugegen sein” (OK, Wb, below). J. Osing (NBÄ
643, n. 672) assumed even “gelegentliche Kontamination mit” Eg. mtr “Zeuge”, which is
perhaps a bit far-fetched. Although the original idea of separating Eg. mtj “exact”
from mtr “to be present” (hence mtr.w “witness”) stemmed from A. H. Gardiner
(l.c. supra), later he (Grd. 1955, 2–3) seems to have become somewhat irresolute in
this matter because of Eg. mtr.t “midday” (preserving its -r- both in hrgl. and Cpt.),
which he maintained to be also related. This brought him to confess that “this idea
of mine may well be a mistake” (i.e., that on Eg. mtj) and that “the question requires the
closest investigation”. The etymology of Eg. mtr.t “midday”, whose etymology is by
far not obvious, is discussed below in a separate entry.
nb2: The derivation of Cpt. (OS) mht from Eg. m3«.tj “tugendhaft, wahrhaftig,
unschuldig befunden, gerecht” (suggested in Wb II 21; Spg. KHW 66 pace Sethe;
Erman 1933, §232; CD 185a; AÄG §211) was and "rmly rejected (as what “semantisch
gar nicht übereinstimmt”) by G. Fecht (1958, 116, fn. 1), who convincingly demonstrated
that the “sportive” wtg. of the "nal component (-mdw) of the late PN ns-p3-mdw
“zum (göttlichen) Stab gehörig” (Ranke PN I 175:1) > Gk. n?/μBE&7 (2nd cent. BC)
vs. Eg. *ns-mdw > Gk. n?μB%&7, oμB%&7 as -mtr (for mtj) is proving the vocalized
form *m†t'j or *mÉt'j of the latter. The arguments of Fecht for explaining Cpt.
(OS) mht from Eg. mtj (not mtr) “richtig” have been almost generally accepted
(CED 78; NBÄ 643–650; KHW 104, 521; Schenkel 1983, 225). Note, however, that
the contamination of Eg. mtj vs. m3«.tj seems to have begun already in Dem. (DG
149, 192) - presumably, due to their similar (identical?) vocalizations.
nb3: Most authors, e.g., W. Spiegelberg (KHW 66), W. Erichsen (DG 190), J. ,erný
(CED 93), W. Westendorf (KHW 103), and J. Osing (1998, 93, n. ae & 165, n. l)
agree in explaining Dem. mtr (mtj) “1. passen, stimmen, richtig sein, 2. zustimmen,
zufrieden sein, übereinkommen, 3. erfassen, 4. unterweisen”, tj mtr (mtr) %3.x “das
Herz zufriedenstellen (in der Formel der Kaufverträge usw.)” (DG 190; NBÄ 648)
= “to agree (clause of sale)” (Reymond 1973, 161) = “to "t, be content, agree”
(CED) and Cpt. (S) T-mate etc. “1. consent, agree, 2. (m) assent, good pleasure”
(CD 189b–190a) = “1. übereinkommen mit, sich freuen über (ejen-, HN-, nμ-),
2. (m) Zustimmung, Zufall” (Spg. KHW 66; Wst. KHW 103) ultimately from Eg.
mtj “richtig”, the secondary sense of which has already been attested in LEg. texts
from Dyn. XXII/XXIII (cf. HPBM IV text, 49, n. 25): mtj “to be pleased, agree
upon” (Caminos, JEA 38, 1952, 46–51) = “zufrieden sein, zustimmen (vom Her
zen)” (NBÄ 648; GHWb 376) = “einverstanden, zufrieden sein” occuring only in
mtj %3tj “das Herz zufriedenstellen” ( Jansen-Winkeln 1989, 237–8 rendering Cami
nos’ mtj from the stela of Shoshenq I at Gebel es-Silsila, l. 35 & 38, as a wtg. of mtn
“belohnen”, q.v.). This (somewhat odd) late semantic shift can only be understood
by assuming LEg. mtj to have primarily signi"ed in fact “to accord exactly with,
be in exact (perfect) accordance”. More dif"cult is to explain the primary mng. of
mtj

Cpt. (S) ma(a)te, (SAL) mete, (AL) meete, (F) meT, (B) maT “1. to reach,
obtain, enjoy, bene"t by, 2. (intr.) be successful, hit the mark” (CD 189b) = “1.
erlangen, besitzen, genießen, 2. erfolgreich sein, teilhaben an” (KHW), which is
usually treated as etymologically identical with Cpt. (S) T-mate (above) and Dem.
mtj (mtr) “passen” (DG), which, in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD, Osing
1998 l.c.), is used as a gloss attached to Eg. m«r “glücklich gelingen, erfolgreich sein”
(Wb, supra). Neverthless, until the suspect, that we are dealing s.v. (S) mate with
the contamination of two distinct Eg. roots, is disproved and the derivation of Cpt.
(S) ma(a)te “to reach” etc. < Eg. mtj “richtig” (Wb) is convincingly demonstrated
in all details, it seems wiser at the moment to treat the latter Cpt. word apart in a
distinct entry (below).
! Hence: (1) mt.t “Eignung, Geeignetheit” (PT 285b, MK, Wb II 168, 2; GHWb 373), mtj (written also mtr) “1. Richtigkeit, Genauigkeit, Geeignetheit, 2. Eignung, Art” (MK, Wb II 173–4; GHWb 373; Junge 2003, 239, n. 344) = “exactitude, exactness” (FD 120), mtj.t (Osing: < old *mtw.t) “Geradheit des Charakters” (XVIII., Wb I 169, 12; NBÄ 645–6, n. 672.2; GHWb 373) = “rectitude” (FD 120) = “exactitude, adéquation” (AL 77.1924) etc.
nb1: W. Westendorf ’s (KHW 104) derivation of Cpt. (S) mhte “Mitte” (v. supra) from
Eg. mt.t is to be preferred to that from Eg. mtj.t (cf. NBÄ 650, n. 673; AL 77.1924).
nb2: The PT 285b instance of mt.t has been alternatively rendered as “middle”
(AEPT 64) = “Mitte” (ÄWb I 574).
nb3: From Eg. mtj a number of further words have been eventually explained,
although their derivation is doubtful or, at least, not perfectly evident. Cf. Eg. mtj
“Vorsteher” (OK, Wb, above). K. Sethe (1923, 198) reconstructed our OEg. root
as mtr (!) “gerade in der Mitte sein”, whence he deduced both Eg. mt.t “Mitte”
(PT 1x, 1st IMP 1x, ÄWb I 574, discussed above) = “?” (MK, Wb II 168, 3–6) >
(S) mhte “Mitte” (KHW 104) and Eg. mtr.t “Mittag” (Lit. MK, Wb, below) > (S)
meere “Mittag, Tag” (KHW 99). Similarly, H.S. Smith (1978, 360): Eg. mtr > (S)
mhte (no mention of mt.t). The latter has been conceived by W. Schenkel (1983,
225) as a var. (*m#tr.'t) akin to Eg. *m†t.'t “Mitte” displaying the semantic shift
“Richtiges” " “Mitte” " “Mittag” (!). Cf. perhaps also n-mt-n “(als Eigenschaftswort
guter Bedeutung) wegen der . . . des” (OK, Wb II 168, 1) = “wegen der Präzision
von” (VI. 1x: Cairo 1435 = Urk. I 102:11, ÄWb I 573).
! Its etymology is still obscure. " 1. GT: a relationship to ES *mtr “to cut” [Lsl.] > i.a. Geez m2tura “precisely, certainly, absolutely, decisively” < matara “to cut (off, up, asunder), break up, interrupt, shut off, depose, remove (from of"ce), exterminate, decree, decide, determine” " m2tur “cut (off ), amputated (piece), deposed, removed, also: decided, decisive, decreed, absolute, strict (commandment), stern ( judgement), severe” [Lsl. 1987, 372] !!! HECu.: Hdy. mutur- “to be sharp”, mutura “sharp (of knife)” [Hds. 1989, 132] seems fair likely whether we stick to the traditional reading mtr (accepted in Wb etc.) or the new spelling mtj, since Eg. -j < AA *-r is plausible, albeit scarcely attested (cf. EDE I 91–92), just like Eg. -j < AA *-l (with more evidence, EDE I 90). " 2. GT: alternatively, a derivation from AA *m-9 (var. *m-t?) “1. good, 2. right, correct (?)” [GT] cannot be excluded either.

mtj or mt(w)tj (?) “? (in einem Zaubertext)” (PT 236aW & LP: Mag. Pap. London 190, 13–14 passim, Wb II 169, 9) = “Giftschlange” (Leitz 1996, 405) = “(serpent?) venimeux (ou qqch. d’approchant)” (Meeks, p.c., 15 March 2000; so also Meeks 2005, 246, #573a) = “Zauberwort” (ÄWb I 573a: PT 236a).
nb1: The three varieties of the word occuring in PT 236a (mtj vs. mjtj in two dif
ferent orthographies) are all without det. The LP forms have either a worm/snake
or spitting mouth det.
nb2: Since PT 236a (utterance 232) is “all utterly obscure” (Faulkner, AEPT 55, utt.
232, n. 1), nothing really supports the rendering of mtj (?) but the mere fact that this
spell is placed among others spells against snakes and scorpions. K. Sethe (ÜKAPT
II 207, VI 135) conceived PT 236a mtj simply as an instance of mt.wt “Gift” in
spite of the clearly different orthographies.
nb3: Rdg. also debated: mtj (Wb, ÄWb) vs. mttj < *mt.wt.j (Leitz l.c.).
mtj



722
! Obscure word. Rdg. and mng. uncertain. Any etymology is premature. " 1. C. Wilke (1931, 127) suggested a quite different rendering: “das aus unbekennten Gründen in drei verschiedenen Schreibungen auftretende Wort mj.tj (sic) . . . sieht wie eine Pseudopartizip 2. Sg. (!) aus. . . . Es mag mit mwj.t ‘Harn’ (mh) zusammenhängen”.
" 2. Following K. Sethe (ÜKAPT II 207), Ch. Leitz (l.c.) and D. Meeks (l.c.) rendered it as a (substantivized) nisbe of Eg. mt.wt “poison” (above), which seems to be corroborated by the det. of spitting mouth in the LP exx. (the LP-GR wtg. of mt.wt having the same det.). This theory can, however, hardly explain either the PT var. mjtj (or *mjtwtj if we stick to Leitz’s idea?) with mj- or the signi"cantly differing PT orthographies of mtj vs. mt.wt (443a, 2255a, the supposed ex. in 128b being uncertain). Therefore, this etymology has to remain a purely hypothetic idea. " 3. G. Takács (1996, 137, #33; 1997, 94, #156.2; 1997, 98–99, #39; 1998, 141, #3.3.3; 2004, 208, #1028), followed by V. Bla&ek (2003, 265), surmised in it (with hesitation) a re#ex of AA *m-9 “1. worm, 2. snake” [GT]. This suggestion is also unprovable and, henceforth, unlikely.

Usually derived from Eg. mtj “richtig, rechtmäßig, genau” (MK, Wb, above) = “correct, accurate” (CED), the signi"cant semantic shift of which, however, has not been satisfactorily demonstrated in either of the relevant works (quoted below).

nb: The etymology of the SA root is still uncertain. L. Reinisch (1890, 253) errone
ously took the SA verb from a hypothetic LECu. *maw. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 214,
#1836) combined the Afar verb with Eg. mz3 “to betake os. to, bring present (to)
etc.” (q.v.). G. Banti (in Burtea et al. 2005, 13–15) and M. Vergari (p.c., 5 April 2007)
rightly separated SA m3d- (suf"x-conjugated) from Afar em1te (pre"x-conjugated) “to
come” < ECu. *-m‡t- as there is no alternation of SA -t- vs. -d-. Vergari excluded
a direct borrowing of Saho-Afar suf"x-conjugated màd- from Ethiosemitic (as “not
likely”), because “borrowed Semitic verbs are usually integrated as pre!x-conjugated verbs in
this East Cushitic subgroup” (as shown by Hayward and Orwin in African Languages
and Cultures 4, 1991, 157–176). Vergari does not know of phonologically possible
ES source that might have been borrowed into Saho-Afar with -d-.
" 5. GT: or, if the underlying old Eg. -C2- was *-3-, it might be even

J. Tropper (1994, 24) identi"ed Ug. m3y directly with Ar. m*y.

nb6: M. Cohen (1947, 190, §474) af"liated the Sem. var. roots with Brb. (sic) m2*

2. Gitter, Gatter, 3. Ge#echt, Weidenkorb, Schutzdach” (KHW 222, 545) to represent
“prob(ably) the same word as” GR mtbr and even (SA) tbhr (!) (in spite of the anomalous
C3 as well as the signi"cantly differing meaning), which was rightly abandoned by
W. Vycichl (DELC 211: “mot apparemment isolé”) and correctly rejected by D. Kurth
(2003, 247, fn. 7: “paßt hinsichtlich der Semantik keineswegs”). Besides, the 2nd cons. (-Ÿ-)
of the Dem. word has been recently read by D. Kurth (2003, 252) as -4- (cf. m0-"bl
below). In addition, J. Osing (NBÄ 202, 735–7, n. 890), W. Westendorf (KHW l.c.),
and W. Vycichl (DELC l.c.) eventually explained the Cpt. (S) tbhl etc. from Eg.
)dbn (act. *)dbl), cf. esp. Eg. dbn “runder Kasten” (Wb V 437, 16).
! Etymology uncertain. " 1. W. Spiegelberg (quoted by Sauneron 1963, 54) saw in it a nomen instr. (Sauneron: lit. “le lieu où l’on capture, le lieu où l’on garde une capture”) of an unattested *tbl that he identi"ed with Akk. tabalû “an sich reißen, entführen”. " 2. G. Sauneron (RdE 15, 1963, 54) and J. ,erný (CED 183) have suggested a connection with Cpt. (SA) tbhr, (B) qrhb (sic) (m) “blow with foot, kick” (CD 401a) = “donner un coup de pied, chasser du pied, ruer” (Sauneron) = “Fußtritt” (KHW 223) = “coup de pied” (DELC 211). Sauneron surmised in GR mtbr an “academic invention”, while ,erný assumed it to represent a borrowing from Sem. with a link to Ar. m$b3l-at- (sic!) “m- being the Semitic pre!x forming words of places”. This latter statement is no argument for a Sem. origin, since the same pre"x m- of nomina loci existed in Eg. also. Moreover, ,erný’s Ar. parallel is phonologically unacceptable. More realistic is P. Wilson’s theory that the Cpt. noun preserved an otherwise not attested Eg. verbal root *tbr “(sg. like) to thump or stemp with a foot” (Sauneron: “un mot du langage populaire”), whence GR mtbr
mtbr



727
was derived with an m- pre"x of nomina loci to signify lit. the “place of thumping of feet” (CED) = “place of stamping the foot” (PL), which might indeed suit as name for “an arena for "ghting or place for keeping animals” (PL). But, as confessed by Sauneron himself, “cette étymologie est, naturellement, incertaine”.
nb: W. Spiegelberg (1919, 58; Spg. KHW 142) and J. Vergote (1950, 293) erroneously
derived (SA) tbhr from Eg. t3-w«r.t “das Bein” (Wb I 287), which W. Westendorf
(KHW 223, fn. 2) considered to be “noch unwahrscheinlicher” after W. E. Crum ( JEA
8, 1922, 187) had disproved the existence of Cpt. (S) *ouhre “Bein”.
" 3. GT: alternatively, its eventual connection (as a late loan) with Akk. ma/udbaru “Steppe, Wüste” [AHW 572] = “steppe, desert” [CAD m1, 11–12] (from Can., cf. von Soden, Or. NS 35, 15 & 46, 189) !! Ug. mdbr “desert, grazing land” [Gordon 1955, 254, #458] = “Einöde” [WUS 75, #724] = “desert” [DUL 525], Hbr. midb3r “(eig. wasserlose) Wüste, Steppe” [GB 398] = “pasture, steppe, wilderness, desert” [KB 547], Off./Imp. Aram. mdbr" “desert, steppe” [DNWSI

nb: This m- pre"x nomen loci has been af"liated in Sem. linguistics (GB, WUS, KB,
Lsl.) with the following isoglosses the ultimate common origin of which has, however,
not been satisfactorily elucidated (their separation within the same entry in DRS
212 also indicates this uncertainty): (1) Ug. dbr “Trift, Weideland” [WUS], Hbr.

mtpn.t



728
nb: Whether m2pn.(t) of PT 40 + 17 (preceded by m3gs.w “dagger”) represents
the very same word is debated. R. O. Faulkner (AEPT 13, utterance 57Q , n. 1)
rendered it “dagger” (!), but recently R. Hannig (ÄWb I 574c) translated it more
cautiously as “Amulett” (suggesting a link rather to MK mtpn.t, see below), while
D. Meeks (2005, 246, #574c) supposed that perhaps it might be “un ex. ancien de
mtpn.t ‘fourreau’ ”.
! Etymology obscure. Already H. Grapow (1914, 32) surmised a pre"x m- in it, although he was unable to identify the simplex in the Eg. lexicon. Most attractive seems #1, but it may be also if the PT attestation of our word (with -2-) proves valid. " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 32) assumed a common origin of MK m2pn.t “Art Schurz” (Wb, infra, Grapow: in fact *”Tasche für den Phallus”?) vs. MK mtpn.t “Dolchscheide” (Grapow: actually *”Tasche für den Dolch”?) in spite of the consequent difference in the orthographies of the -C2-.
" 2. G. Jéquier (1921, 152; 1921, 200), followed by A. H. Gardiner (1927, 497, T8), P. Lacau (1954, 86, 1970 phon., 33–34, §10), and P. Kaplony (KBIÄF 184, n. 268) explained it as the m- pre"x form of an unattested Eg. *tpn regarded to be the older var. of *tpj “(l’ancien nom du) poignard” ( Jéquier) = “dagger” (Grd. l.c.: “the existence of a lost word tp ‘dagger’ is also suggested by the late name mtpn.t . . . ‘dagger’, . . . probably a derivative therefrom”) = “le nom primitif du poignard” (Lacau). Thus, mtpn.t (as a nomen loci) might have in fact denoted “place of the dagger”. Jéquier (1921, 152) accounted for a very early disappearence of Eg. *-n in the word (“le n, étant une consonne faible, a pu disparaître au cours de l’époque thinite ne laissant au signe hiéroglyphique que la valeur des deux consonnes fortes t et p”). Lacau (1970, 29–41) listed further exx. for the shift of Eg. -n > -j, while Kaplony (l.c.) postulated Eg. *tpl “Dolch” (as var. *mtpl.t), which would better explain the shift.
nb1: Note that Jéquier’s understanding the lit. sense of mtpn.t as “pour (!) le poig
nard” (with an m- prep. of dat.!) is false.
nb2: G. Fecht (1979, 108, fn. 1) and K. Jansen-Winkeln (1993, 10) rendered Eg. *tpj
“Dolch” as a nisbe (-j) of tp “head”, lit. “der zu dem eine Spitze gehört”, which
would rule out the suggested derivation of mtpn.t < *tpn.
" 3. GT: the comparison of the hypothetic Eg. *tpn with WCh. *p-n-d “quiver (Köcher)” [ JS 1981, 209B] seems – in the light of PT m2pn.t – also unlikely. " 4. G. Takács (1996, 52, #58) erroneously traced it back to a biconsonantal Eg. *mt- based on the unconvincing comparison with Eg. mt3j.t ~ mt3.w “Art Spieß” (Wb, supra), mtf.t “Art Dolch” (Wb, infra), mtnj.t “Art Beil” (Wb, infra).
mtf.t

mtf.t “Art Dolch” (MK, Wb II 170, 7) = “1. le fourreau de poignard, étui pour le poignard, 2. poignard (!)” ( Jéquier 1921, 200, 350 index) = “*Scheide (von Dolch, von *Säge)” (GHWb 374; ÄWb II 1157). ! Etymology obscure. In any case, it seems to be an m- pre"x nomen instr./loci.
" 1. G. Jéquier (1921, 200, fn. 9) analyzed it as a compound of a certain Eg. prep. m “pour” (!) (not pre"x!) + tf “scie”. The "rst assumption is certainly false. Besides, the latter root contained also a third -3 (Wb V 298: tf3 “Säge”). Nevertheless, R. Hannig (ÄWb l.c.) also seems to assume Eg. mtf.t to be a nomen loci of tf(3). " 2. GT: or cf.

mtmt “1. hin- und herreden, 2. (Plan) erörten, diskutieren” (XVIII., Wb II 170, 8–9; GHWb 374) = “s’enquérir” (Posener 1957, 132 & fn. 6) = “to discuss” (FD 121). Hence: mtmt “Klatsch” (late NK, Wb II 170, 10) = “discussion” (FD 121) = “*Diskussion” (GHWb 374).
nb1: Rendering disputed. Rejecting the LEg. hapax mtmt “Klatsch” (“ist zu streichen”),
J. F. Quack (1994, 103, fn. 68) found that mtmt of Wb II 170, 8–9 “nach pLeiden I

sinnvoll ” and “näherliegend” is mtmt in Urk. VI 105:8, for which he supposed the
sense “aufwiegeln” (unless to be read as smtj “verhören”).
nb2: E. M. Ishaq (1991, 116, §xix.2) deduced Eg. Ar. matmat “to argue”, matmata
“speech, prattle, argument” either from Cpt. (SAL) moute (< Eg. mdw, below)
or Eg. mtmt.
! Etymology uncertain. " 1. G. Posener (1957, 132 & fn. 6) views that mtmt “est apparenté au caus.

In addition, Eg. smt is not necessarily a caus.

certainly represents a distinct root.
nb2: A var. with a voiced -C2- is attested in NBrb.: Mzab mm2dm2d “grogner,

! Other suggestions that have been made for the etymology of Eg. mtmt cannot be accepted.
nb: (1) Eg. mtmt can hardly have anything to do with Nub.: Kunuzi, Dongola

semantically rather weak. (4) Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 211, #1823) af"liated it with

nb1: Occurs also in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD) as mdn (so, -d-, glossed
with OCpt. mouten) “beschriften” (Osing 1998, 89).
nb2: Perhaps a hypothetic LEg. var. *mtj (with the late shift of -n > -j, cf. its defec
tive form m2 in Amduat) may have been borrowed into Bed. as mity3 “to describe”
[Rpr. 1928, 219], which has been attested also as mityãy, pl. mítyay (m) “Befehl,
Gebot”, mityay “befehlen” [Rn. 1895, 176] (with a phonologically unconvincing
Sem. etymology).
! Hence: mtn “Steuerliste, der Kataster” (late NK, Wb II 171, 5; GHWb 375) = “Liste” (Lange 1925, 28). ! P. Wilson (PL 476) assumed a connection with NK mtn “to reward” (conceived by her as an act of providing “the reward of"cially con"rmed by the a written receipt or document”). An etymological connection between PT m2n “to assign (places)” (AEPT 292) vs. NK mtn “to mark” (PL, lit. *”to sign”) seems in fact semantically plausible.
mtn “evil renown (?)” (late NK, DLE I 253). ! GT: its coincidence with NBrb.: Mzg. a-muttel, pl. i-muttil-n “châtiment divin, punition, malédiction (divine)” [Tf. 1991, 443] may be due to pure chance.

and modern contamination (lit. see above s.v. Eg. mtj). W. Spiegelberg (1917, 115 &
mtn – mtr



732
fn. 1) erroneously explained the “vieldeutig” Eg. )mtr from the Grundbedeutung “gerade
sein” (of )mtj), whereby he rendered mtr (r) “unterrichten (über)” (late NK, Wb
II 171, 19) = “(über etwas) belehren” (Spg.) as a piel form lit. signifying “gerade
machen, erziehen (oder vielleicht auf den rechten Weg bringen”), cf. sb3j.t mtr.t
“Erziehungslehre” (Spg. contra Erman, ZÄS 32, 1894, 127 suggesting “mündliche
(?) Lehre”) = “enseignement éducatif (litt. enseignement et instruction)” (Bickel &
Mathieu 1993, 32). A. H. Gardiner’s view (1955, 2–3) is correct that “two stems are
involved ” here, namely (1) mtr “to witness” (as for its generally accepted identity with
mtr “to be present” cf. below) vs. (2) mtj “normal, regular, middle”. But that Eg.
mtr.t “midday” had -r also in Cpt. made Gardiner hesitate (admitting that “the idea
may be a mistake”). Most recently, F. Junge (2003, 225, n. 199) has correctly reaf"rmed
the separation of mtj “richtig” vs. mtr/j “bezeugen”.
nb2: One can hardly agree with setting up a separate verbal (basic!) sense of mtr
as “1. zugegen sein, präsent sein” (Wb II 171, 9; GHWb 375) based (acc. to the
Belegstellen ad Wb l.c.) solely on mtr(t) of Pap. Anastasi I 7:7 (rendered in DLE
I 253 “to assist”!). This verbal sense is attested neither in the OK (ÄWb I 574b)
nor in the MK (ÄWb II 1157b–c; DCT 190). For the problem of Eg. mtr (or mtj)
“Gegenwart” (NK-GR, Wb) occuring in the compound preps. see below.
nb3: W. F. Albright (1918, 87) explained Gk. μ5(%#(97 “witness” as a borrowing
from LEg. mtr.w (Boisacq 1916, 612: < IE *smer- “to remember”!). Considering
this proposal as “%) ;)-3*&#+%# 3((!)%”, P. V. Ernštedt (1953, 49–50) suggested
a LEg. etymon *ar-metré (cf. jr mtr.t “Zeugnis ablegen für jem.”, late NK, Wb II
172, 12) with hesitation (“#**()**, <(*'#6”), whence he took the Gk. term (with
met.) adding also Lat. arbiter [*ar-miter] “Augenzeuge, Schiedsrichter, Gebieter”,
arbitrari “beobachten, meinen”, whose IE etymology is obscure (cf. LEW I 62;
Ernout & Meillet 1959, 42–43). J. Katz (kind p.c., 3 April 2007) thinks “it would be
hard to relate the two words . . . in morpho-phonological terms”. Also J. Puhvel (kind p.c., 5
April 2007) sees “no way to relate martus and arbiter to each other”. He derives the Gk.
term from IE *smÓtu- > Skt. smÓti- ’memory, record, history’, thus an abstract “wit
ness” (as in “to bear witness”), marked with the suf"x *-ro-. He also "nds Thieme’s
game try *mÓt-tur- ’grasping death’ (cf. Lat. mort- vs. Lith. tver-/tur- “to hold”)
hardly likely. On the other hand, Puhvel regarded the etymology of Lat. arbiter
is fairly hopeless: “it has been considered a loanword from Umbrian, which allows ar- <
*ad-, but suggestions for the remainder are not worth repeating. Even the Umbrian origin (rather
than vice versa) is doubtful, since it occurs already in the Twelve Tables”. Cf. also H. Rix in
Indogermanische Forschungen 95 (1990) 281–283.
nb4: Eg. mtr may have been borrowed into ONub. (where the "nal -r was preserved).
E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 183) combined Eg. mtr with ONub. matar-ki “Symbolum”
(and Mer. mtr “Wahrzeichen o.ä.”), while W. Vycichl (1934, 58) compared it with
ONub. matar-a— “als Zeuge fungieren”.
! Hence: (1) mtr.w “Zeuge” (MK, Wb II 172; GHWb 375; ÄWb I 574: 3x already in V.-VI.) = “witness” (FD 121) > Cpt. (SAL) mNtre, metre, (FS) metrh, (B) meqre “witness, testimony” (CD 177a; CED 86) = “Zeuge” (KHW 105).
nb: Its OK vocalization has been reconstructed as *m'tr°w (NBÄ 176; Snk. 1983,
225 pace NBÄ).

“Mittag” (below) explained by him from the lit./basic mng. “Richtiges” (!), which
results from the confusion of three distinct Eg. roots that can hardly be approved
(cf. Eg. mt.t “Mitte” and mtj “richtig”, supra).
" 2. E. Zyhlarz and W. Vycichl (lit. infra) have convincingly compared Eg. mtr with certain (mostly NBrb.) re#exes of Brb. *ta-matár-t “Zeichen” [Zhl.], cf. NBrb.: Mzg. ta-matar-t (no pl.) “1. signe, indice, 2. point de repère, 3. signe de reconnaissance, mot de passe, 4. signe précurseur, avant-coureur” [Tf. 1991, 444], Zayan & Sgugu 2a-ma2ar2 “signe de reconnaissance” [Lbg. 1924, 570], Izdeg ta-matar-t, pl. ti-matar-in “signal, signe” [Mrc. 1937, 235] | Mzab ta-mtar-t, pl. ti-mitar “1. marque distinctive, signalement, 2.

nb1: Although both Zyhlarz and Vycichl quoted both meanings of Eg. mtr (“1.
zugegen sein” vs. “2. bezeugen, Zeuge sein für”) in their etymologies, this Eg.-Brb.
comparison reaf"rms just the likelihood of the Eg. basic meaning being closer rather
to “3. zeigen, 4. (an)erkennen, anmelden”.
nb2: The common Brb. root *)m-t-r has apparently no further AA parallels (in
Sem., Cu.-Om. or Ch.). K.-G. Prasse (PAM 332) af"liated the EWlm.-Ayr forms with
EWlm. 2992r “1. demander à Dieu dans la prière, 2. prier, 3. avancer, proposer un
prix pour”, which is semantically unconvincing. Equally unlikely seems a connection
with NBrb.: Ksur muter “trouver, estimer” !! WBrb.: Zng. mader “chercher, s’étonner”
(Brb.: Bst. 1890, 312). Cf. perhaps NOm.: Haruro mu9ur-o “voto” [Crl. 1937, 655]
and/or ECh.: Mkl. máddárá (f ) “trace, cause, motif, raison” [ Jng. 1990, 136]?
! Other etymologies cannot be accepted. " 3. L. Reinisch (1890, 274): ~ Sem. *m2l “gleich, ähnlich sein”. Excluded both phonologically and semantically. " 4. W. F. Albright (1927, 218; quoted also in Clc. 1936, #642) erroneously assumed the following chain of semantic changes: Eg. mtr (sic, -r!) “to be right, just” " mtr “to bear witness” " “middle”. His comparanda are also false: Ar. mtr “to stretch”, Sem. *matn- “hip” > Ar. matn- “1. middle of back, loins, 2. middle of the road”, Sem. *wtr “to stretch”. " 5. C. T. Hodge (1961, 36) suggested a connection with NOm.: Gimirra mite “testimonio” [CR 1925, 622 pace Montandon] | Kaffa mit- “ testimoniare”, mit. “ testimonianza” [Crl. 1951, 475],
Mocha m5`to ~ m5`9o “evidence, witness, proof ”, m5`9a-yé “to testify” [Lsl. 1959, 42–43]. This striking parallel (which yields no match for Eg. -r) may be purely accidental.
nb1: In this case, the writing of OK -r and Cpt. -r- do not allow to suppose that
the original spelling of the Eg. word was *mtj, although already in the MK there
was a tendency of “false archaisation” (during the -r > -j process, cf. Müller 1909;
Schenkel 1965; Vycichl 1983, 29).
nb2: Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 211, #1823) extended the false Eg.-Mocha etymology to
Ar. mtn “to swear, take an oath”, Eg. mtmt “to discuss” < AA *-mi(i)t- “to testify
to”.
nb3: Eg. mtr “to testify” can have equally nothing in common with LECu.: Baiso
amat- “to swear” [HL 1988, 68] !!! CCh.: Mada ámma*a “faire le serment, jurer
(le faux serment entraîne la mort)” [Brt.-Bléis 1990, 178].
mtr.t “Mittag” (Lit. MK, Wb II 174, 6–7; GHWb) = “midday” (XVIII., FD 121) = “midi” (Lacau 1970, 70) = “midi (ce qui est au milieu)”

" *mi3r.at (DELC 119; Vcl. 1991, 123). F. L. Grif"th (1901, 76), G. Maspero
(1903, 161, 163), and P. Lacau (1970, 69–70) provided further exx. for the shift of
Eg. *-tr- > *-"r- (if preceded by a Tonvokal) that may be opposed to those with *-tr
unchanged (if preceding a Tonvokal) like, e.g., Eg. mtr.w “witness” (Lacau: *metr.°j)
> (SA) mNtre, (B) meqre, (F) metrh. ! Origin uncertain. " 1. Usually explained from a hypothetic Eg. adj. root *mtr “middle” (unattested with this mng.) based on its frequent equation with Eg. mt.t “midst” (DLE I 251) = “Mitte” (GHWb 376) > Dem. mtr, mtj “Mitte” (DG 191) > Cpt. (SALK) mhte, (S) mhhte “Mitte” (KHW 104). Dubious.
nb: Over the past century, the most diverse scenarios have been put forward to
justify the relationship of both terms as well as their supposed derivation either
from Eg. mtj “correct” or mtr “to testify” (or even both!). In the view of K. Sethe
(1914, 114), mt.t (*m1t.et) originates directly from m/tr.et (lit. “Mitte”) “sehr früh nach
Ausfall von r”, while mtr.t “Mittag” retained the original stem with -r-. He (Sethe
1923, 198) postulated the basic sense of *mtr to have been “gerade in der Mitte
sein” (maintaining the connection with Eg. mtj “richtig usw.”, above). W. F. Albright
(1927, 218; quoted also in Clc. 1936, #642) erroneously assumed the following chain
of semantic changes: Eg. mtr (sic, -r!) “to be right, just” " mtr “to bear witness”
" “middle”. His comparanda are equally false (Ar. mtr “to stretch”, Sem. *matn
“hip” > Ar. matn- “1. middle of back, loins, 2. middle of the road”, Sem. *wtr “to
stretch”!). Besides, H. Möller (1911, 66, 158, 170) combined Eg. mtr.t “Mittag” and
mt.t “Mitte” (above) and Ar. matn- “the middle part (of a bow, a spear, a sword,
a road)” also with IE *médh-Ê-o-s “medius”. A. H. Gardiner (1955, 2–3) correctly
suggested a distinction between Eg. mtr “to be present” vs. mtj “normal, regular”,
although he derived the basic sense “middle” of mtr.t “midday” from the latter
(!). The fact that its -r was preserved also by Cpt. -r made Gardiner hesitate: “this
idea of mine may well be a mistake. The question requires the closest investigation”. J. Vergote
(1973 Ib, 36 & 139) eventually explained both mtr.t “midday” and mt.t “middle”
from an old *mútr.at, whereby he assumed a Wortspaltung resulting in *mú"r.a(t)
“midday” vs. *mút".a(t) > (via met.) *mú"t.a(t) “middle”. J. Osing (NBÄ 149, 649),
in turn, regarded the derivation of Eg. mt.t and Dem. mtj “Mitte” from the old
fem. adj. mtj.t > mt.t (*mÉ/#t.'t) “richtig, gerade, genau” as “sicher”, which was
- according to him - “neugebildet” (!) in (or before) Dyn. XVIII as mtr.t (*m°/#tr.'t)
“Mittag” (lit. “richtig, genau”!), but he failed to resolve the contradiction how and
why this additional -r was attached to the old root mtj. Even more far-fetched is
mtr.t



736
the position occupied by W. Vycichl (DELC 119), who pondered whether mtr.t
“midi” is related to both mtr “être présent” and mtr (sic, -r!) “exact”. W. Schenkel
(1983, 225) derived both mt.t “Mitte” and mtr.t “Mittag” from the literary mng.
“Richtiges” (!) related to Eg. mtr.w “Zeuge”, although he discussed these forms
separately from Eg. mtj “richtig”!
" 2. GT: its relationship (via var. *mdr.t) to the Brb. word for “evening” is not only semantically doubtful, but certainly excluded.
nb1: Cf. NBrb.: Rif: Tuzin, Iznasen 2a-meddi-2 “soir (après le coucher du soleil)”
[Rns. 1932, 385], Mnsr. 2a-mdir-2 (var. 2a-meddi-2) “soir” [Bst.] = 2a-madir-2 “eve
ning” [Bates], Halima 2a-meddi-2 “soir” [Bst.] !! EBrb.: Gdm. )m-d: ta-meddi-t,
pl. t2-m2ddi-t-5n “soir” [Lanfry 1973, 204, #969]. These parallels cannot derive
from *)m-d-r. K.-G. Prasse (kind p.c., 12 April 2007) believes tamdirt is an error
for tamde0t. Moreover, as he pointed out, there are several words for “afternoon”
derived from the common Brb. verbal root *)d-w-h “to depart or arrive in the
afternoon”, cf. Tuareg tadwat, tadwit, tadäggat, Shilh & Mzg. tadggwat [-ggw- <
*-ww-], Mzg. tamddit, Qbl. & Izn. tamëddit, Menacer tamdë0t [prob. < *tamdë3t],
tamëddë0t [< tamëddë3t]?
nb2: O. Bates (1914, 83) erroneously combined the Brb. term with Eg. mšr.w (q.v.),
which is phonologically certainly excluded (Eg. -š- + Brb. *-d-). For the Brb. root
cf. alternatively perhaps Ar. wamida “être d’une chaleur étouffante et humide (se
dit d’une nuit)” [BK II 1610] = “schwül sein (von der Nacht)” [Müller] (for which
Müller 1961, 201, #4 suggested a false Eg. etymology).
" 3. GT: if we assume an OEg. etymon *m2r.t < *mkl.t (for discussing the anomaly of old *-l- vs. Cpt. -r- in an etymological context v. Takács 2005, 82–83, #7.12–19), a striking parallel appears in the common Brb. term for “midday meal”.
nb1: Cf. NBrb.: Shilh: Tazerwalt i-mk/li “Mittagsbrot, Mittagszeit” [Stumme 1899,

3 April 2007] (Brb.: Prv. 1911, 109; LR 1999, 291).
NB2: This hypothetic Eg.-Brb. equation rises, however, the fundamental question of
why the simplex is not attested in Eg. (one might expect OEg. *2r or *2rj> MK *tr
or *trj, resp., “to spend the midday” or sim.; a relationship with Eg. tr is of course
excluded). The Brb. forms are extended by a pre"x m-, although there is no agree
ment in determining the primary root (*k-l-y or *k-l-w?). In any case, most likely
seems a derivation from common Brb. *k-l “passer le milieu du jour” reconstructed
by Aghali-Zakara (2002, 44f.), which – in the view of M. Kossmann (kind p.c., 3
April 2007) - represents in this case “the only serious etymology” that is “commonly accepted
among Berberologists”. M. Tai" (1991, 330) too, explained Mzg. mekla etc. from the
root )k-l: kel “passer la journée”. On the other hand, both Provotelle and Stumme
mtr.t



737
(l.c.) assumed a late borrowing from Ar. ma"kal- “a place and a time of eating”
[Lane 73] or ma"kal-at- “aliment, repas, festin” [Dozy I 31] (< Sem. *"kl “to eat”),
which would certainly rule out the Eg.-Brb. etymology suggested here. But K.-G.
Prasse (p.c., 3 April 2007) has "rmly excluded any derivation from Arabic. A rela
tionship of Brb. *k-l-y ~ *k-l-w (or sim.) with Sem. *"kl “to eat” is also impossible.
Lanfry (1973, 149–150, #744), in turn, took Gdm. a-m2kli from e-kl “être hôte de
passage”, which is rather unconvincing both semantically and phonologically (the
root )k-l has no third -w or -y). Prasse (PAM 1998, 216) explained EWlm. & Ayr
t2-melkew-t from *l-k-w, but PAM 1998, 193 give only EWlm. & Ayr 2-lk2w “puiser

nb: G. Roquet (1973, 162, fn. 1) reconstructed *imtárri (sic) " *imtájji (sic) "

should assume perhaps rather *m'tår.'t/w > *m'tåj.'(t/w) > *Àtåj('). J. ,erný
(CED 92), W. Westendorf (KHW 103 & fn. 6), and H.S. Smith (1978, 360) correctly
distinguished Cpt. (S) μto from (S) μtw (f ) “depth” < Dem. mtj (mtr) “Tiefe,
Länge” (DG 191:2) < Eg. m3.t (the two Cpt. forms were still confused in CD l.c.).
Gardiner (AEO I 7*, §23) rightly surmised that “perhaps there was contamination of the
two words”. J. Osing (1976, 217, n. 678) and W. Westendorf (KHW 104) separated
(S) μto < Eg. mtr.(t/w) also from (L) mht treated by J. ,erný (l.c.) as a var. of (S)
μto, while Roquet (1973, 162, fn. 1) surmised in (S) μto a merger of the re#exes
of two diverse etyma, namely (1) that meaning “profondeur” < Eg. m3.(w)t vs.
(2) that signifying “#ot” < Eg. mtr.t, their coincidence being due to “l’hybridation”
of (S) μtw vs. (S)μto.

Vittmann (1997, 283): “es ist auffallend, daß dieses mtr.t nie ‘syllabisch’ geschrieben wird. Handelt es sich wirklich um eine semitische Entlehnung? ”. This doubt is corroborated also by the Genuswechsel as well as by the suspect that the same Eg. mtr.t occurs already in Pap. Kahun l.c.

The same word (?) may be represented by: (1) mr0.t (var. mr0) “ein ge#ochtenes Hausgerät” (late NK, Wb II 112, 10; GHWb 350) = “strainer or sieve” ( Janssen 1975, 145–6, §16) = “Korb” (Gutgesell, LÄ III 1074) = “crible (désignant toujours un récipient en bronze)” (Aufrère 2003, 25 & fn. 65) vs. mr0 “das Sieb” (GR, Wb II 112, 12; WD II 65: cf.

nb: The sense “sieve” was doubted by W. Helck (LÄ V 924). The derivation of the
Cpt. forms from Eg. mr0.t "rst suggested by W. E. Crum (CD l.c.) and has been
maintained - in spite of the changes in the material of the vessel - by W. Westendorf
(KHW l.c.) and J. J. Janssen (1975, 145–7, §16 & fn. 60–61 with lit.) pointing out
that k3.t-m(t)r0.t was of metal at least in two contexts (elsewhere made of basketry)
signifying perhaps “the well-known type of metal strainer or sieve, of which several exx. were
discovered at Thebes and elsewhere”.
(2) k3.t-mtr0.t (Pap. Ebers 66:19) vs. k3.t-mr0.t (late NK) “ein Gefäß aus Bronze” (Wb II 112, 11 vs. II 174, 16 & V 94, 3–4) = “kind of vessel” (CED) = “ein Gefäß” (GHWb 376) = “ein Sieb von Metall” (Pap.

pound with k3.t “der äußere weibliche Geschlechtsteil” (PT, Wb V 93, 12–14) =
“(mot très ancien, désigne) la partie féminine” (Aufrère), in which he saw “une preuve
d’un lien . . . entre le crible et la naissance” demonstrated in detail throughout his paper.
nb2: There seems to be a communis opinio that, in spite of the additional -t-, both
mtr0.t and mr0.t represent the same word. W. Westendorf (1962, 44–45, §71.2)
supposed mr0.t to be due to the “Fortfall des t”, but in alternatively he (o.c., p. 45,
fn. 1) pondered whether a reverse process was the case: “oder ist mr0.t das urspr. Wort,
in das t als ‘Übergangslaut’ geschoben ist?” (cf. Hintze 1949, 46f.). J.J. Janssen (l.c.) too
maintained both mtr0.t and mr0.t to “indicate one and the same object”, the compound
k3.t-m(t)r0.t being the “de!nite proof of their identity” (both words never occur together
in the same text). He also supposed that probably mtr0.t was the earlier form (only
in texts from Dyn. XIX and early Dyn. XX, while some of the exx. of mr0.t occur
also in the middle of Dyn. XX) and because only the var. mr0.t survived into Dem.
Cpt. S. Aufrère (l.c.) passed by this problem only stating that mr0 “se lit aussi” mtr0.t,
while k3.t-mtr0.t “se retrouve également sous la forme” k3.t-mr0.t.
! Original (OK) spelling unknown. Etymology uncertain. Apparently an m- pre"x nomen instr. as surmised already by H. Grapow (1914, 32), although the underlying root is still debated.

" 1. H. Smith (1979, 162) pondered a possible derivation from Eg. r0t “to wash (clothes)” (Wb II 448, 8). Unlikely, since the latter had -t as part of the root. Should we suppose a met.

GT: if mtr0.t is the older var., in principle, a hypothetic basic verb *tr0 “to sift or shake” (or sim.) might be set up, which might be equated (via met. and an irreg. but attested correspondence Eg. t ~ Sem. *2) with Can. *02r (?) “to sift” [GT] > Ug. 02r “Schaufel oder Sieb (?)” [Ast. 1948, 221] = “Sieb” [WUS #1109] = “instrument for scattering” [Gordon 1955, 269, #755] = “strainer, sieve” [DL & Sanmartín, UF 5, 1973, 89; Stieglitz, JCS 33, 1981, 53; Healey, UF 15, 1983, 51] = “winnowing rake, sieve, a tool” [Watson 1996, 702] = “a tool” [DUL 416], NHbr. %šr “sieben, ausstreuen” [Dalman 1922, 163] = “streuen, in kleinen Teilen herabfallen lassen, daher auch: sieben” [Levy 1924 II 125] = “to peel, sift, distil drops as if through a sieve” [ Jastrow 1950, 511], JAram. %šr [irreg. -š- in#uenced by Hbr.?] “sieben, (aus)streuen” [Dalman & Levy & WUS] = “to sift” [ Jastrow].

nb2: The reconstruction of the Can. root is rather problematic. J. Levy (l.c.) assumed
a Grundwurzel *šr (based on the dubious equation with )nšr ~ )nšl). J. Aistleitner

qqch., en ôter les ordures ou les parties moins bonnes, 2. laisser les parties moins
bonnes d’un mets” [BK II 575] = “etwas von den schlechten Teilen befreien” [WUS
pace Al-Yasin], which is not generally accepted (Ug. -2- + Ar. -š-). GT: alternatively,
cp. perhaps Ar. 0a2ara I “2. être dans l’agitation, dans le désordre (se dit de l’esprit)”
[BK II 541] = “1. to heave, become agitated (soul or stomach) by a tendency to
vomit, 2. become disordered” [Lane 704] with var. 0atara (-t-!) “to heave, become
agitated (soul or stomach) by a tendency to vomit” [Lane 701]. In addition, Ug.
02r has been recently reinterpreted as “bieldo” [OL] = “a (bladed) weapon (?)”
[Watson 1996] = “dagger, knife” [Watson 2000] = “pitchfork” [Watson 1970,
110f. quoted after DLU] = “una herramienta” [DLU I 203], which led W. G. E.
Watson (1996, 702–3; 2000 MS, 3, §20) to explain it as a Wanderwort borrowed
from Hurrian 0ašeri “dagger, knife” [Watson] = “Dolch” [Haas & Thiel], albeit
he regarded this etymology to be “only (a) very tentative solution”.

! Etymology highly debated. Apparently a foreign word. " 1. J. Lauth (1871, 635, §142) and C. Ceugney (1880, 9) explained it from Hbr. meteg “Zaum” [GB 474] = “bridle” [KB] = “frenum” [Ceugney], PBHbr. & JAram. mitg3 “Zaum” [GB & Levy 1924 III 295], cf. also Tigre mateg “thin neck” [LH 126b], which was apparently ignored by both W. Helck and J. Hoch (below). " 2. L. Reinisch (1890, 257) af"liated Eg. mnt3 (misquoted as mn3t) with LECu.: Saho ma«as “gerben die Haut”, Agaw *mVr- “Leder
sack”, and even Eg. md3 “Lederschurz”. Absurd. " 3. W. Helck (1962, 563, #131; 1971, 515, #131) saw in Eg. mt3j the hitpael part. of Hbr. n)y qal “zerstört werden” [GB 516] = qal “to go to ruin”, nifal “to be destroyed, devastated” [KB 715] = “zerzaust werden” [Helck] = “to fall in ruins” [Hoch], which was rejected by J. Hoch (1994, 175). Eg. mnt3, in turn, has been derived by Helck (1971, 513, #92) with hesitation (“wenn überhaupt kan.”) from Hbr. nt) “1. niederreißen, zerstören, 2. ausschlagen (v.d. Zähnen)” [GB 531] = qal “to tear down, pull down” [KB 736]. This etymology was also rejected by Hoch (1994, 130) on semantic grounds. D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 16, §1.2.2.1 & 36, §2.1.2.5) derived both Eg. forms from Hbr. nt). " 4. J. Hoch (1994, 175, §233), in turn, supposed Eg. mt3j to “possibly” re#ect JAram. ma9r2q3 “Peitsche” [Dalman 1922, 233] = “Ruthe, Schlägel” [Levy 1924 III 95] = “a goad, whip” [ Jastrow 1950, 770], which he (Hoch 1994, 130, §168) extended also to mnt3 with reservations (“although quite dif!cult”). Phonologically unconvincing. In addition, Hoch ultimately af"liated all these words with O/PBHbr. )ir«3 (coll.) “Hornissen, Wespen” [GB 695; Levy IV 220] = “hornet,
wasp” [KB 1056], BAram. 92r5qayy3 (coll.) “hornets” [Hoch, not listed in GB, KB, Dalman, Levy, Jastrow], which raises several doubts.
nb: First, JAram. ma9r2q3 corresponds to Ar. mi9raq- “1. baguette avec laquelle
on bat la laine ou le coton, 2. battant de dégraisseur, de lavandier, 3. marteau
de forgeron, 4. bâton, gourdin de berger” [BK II 78] (< Sem. *9r=), which Hoch
forgot to quote. Secondly, Hoch (1994, 393–4, #591 & fn. 56) af"liated the Hbr.

nb: The word occurs during Dyn. XX in GW: ma-2i-tá (Ward).
! Origin obscure. " 1. It may be a late defective writing of OK mn23.t (as suggested by Wb, GHWb, Ward). Strangely, W. A. Ward (1985, 333, fn. 18) regarded both m2.t and mn23.t as “old Semitic loans which, by Late Egyptian times, had become part of the native vocabulary, their foreign origin having long been forgotten”, although he failed to present any evidence. " 2. GT: if, in turn, Eg. m2.t is a distinct (native) word, perhaps it might be derived from a old (pre-OK) etymon *mk.t < AA *m-k-w “sort of vessel” [GT] (discussed above s.v. Eg. mk “a vessel”, CED 80).

to write *m m23 jb=k (for the omission of m before an initial m- cf. ZÄS 56, 1920,

new interpretation has been followed by G. Fecht (1981 l.c.) and H.-W. Fischer-Elfert

late (and isolated) occurence of MK m23 “(to) challenge” as it has been suggested
by J. G. Grif"ths ( JEA 44, 1958, 78 and LÄ III 57) is disputed. Instead, D. Kurth

nb1: The relatedness of Ar. makara I “1. tromper qqn., agir avec ruse à l’égard
de qqn., séduire, induire en erreur” [BK II 1138] = “to deceive, cheat” [Zbr.] has
been suggested by Th. Nöldeke (1910, 76, fn. 4) and recently by A. Zaborski (1991,
1677) and others, while C. Brockelmann (1928, 385) af"liated Can. *mkr “to sell”
with Eth.-Sem. *mkr “to advise”.
nb2: H. Zimmern (quoted in GB 422) surmised in Hbr. mkr a loan eventually bor
rowed from Sum. via Akk. makkuru. Other authors (e.g., GB 422; Möller 1911,
141; Zaborski 1971, 73, #122), however, suggest that Sem. *mkr is an m- pre"x
extension deriving ultimately from Sem. *kry > Hbr. kry qal “1. to purchase, buy,
2. barter for («al)” [KB 497] | Ar. kry III “to employ for hire”, IV “to let on hire”,
VI & VIII & X “to hire” [Lane 3000] = III “locavit”, IV “to let on hire”, VI &
VIII “conduxit (rem)” [Möller]. Sem. *kry is supposed to have been borrowed into
PIE *kwrey- “to buy, trade” (IS 1964, 6, #18; GI 1984, 875; Dlg. 1989, 7).
m(3 (or GW for m() “das männliche Glied” (late NK, Wb II 175, 5) = “männliches Glied” (Grapow 1954, 57) = “Penis, männliches Glied” (GHWb 376) = “penis” (Walker 1996, 270) = “foreskin” (WD II 69 after Zonhoven) > GR m2 “phallus” vs. m23 (denom.?) “to erect phallus” (Hibis, Cruz-Uribe 1988, 268) = m23 “phallus” (Edfu, PL 477).
nb1: As to whether m23 (with linen det., V6) of the Berlin Leather Scroll (Pap.
Berlin 3029, 1:9–10) has to be rendered as m23m “swaddling clothes” (de Buck) or
as defective wtg. of 23m (de Wit, ZÄS 99/1, 1972, 42) or *m23m (Blumenthal) or
as m23 “foreskin” (here by no means “penis”), see Zonhoven, ZÄS 125 (1998), 84,
who suggests that the reading as m23 “has the advantage that no emendation of !nal m is
necessary – assuming that m23 may also designate the ‘foreskin’ . . .”. In addition, the word
occurs in a similar context also in Urk. VII 34:1 (MK) where surely m 23m “from
the foreskin” must be read.
nb2: The same word occurs presumably also in Dem. m33 ~ m3 ~ m«3 “Phallus”
(DG 150, 154, 193), which would have still to be proven. For LEg. -2 > Dem. -3
cf. Dem. 03n “ein Gemüse: Lauch” (DG 373:2) < LEg. 02n (GW) “ein Gemüse:
Lauch (?)” (Wb III 354), or Dem. g3 “eine Frucht” (DG 595:6) < LEg. k2 (GW)
“eine P#anze, deren Blüten und pr.t-Früchte als Schmuck verwendet werden” (Wb
V 148) = “saf#ower” (DLE IV 48). Relevent might be perhaps also the interchange
of GW -2- ~ -3- in LEg. (GW) k2n ~ k3n “charioteer” (Hoch 1994, 341–4, §506).
Note, however, that the velar environment is missing in the case of LEg. m2(3).
! Origin highly debatable, albeit is it dif"cult to a priori agree with P. Behrens (LÄ IV 1019, n. 4), who regarded this word as “nicht etymologisierbar”.
" 1. Most authors (Ceugney 1880, 9; Grapow 1914, 15, 32; Spg. 1917, 96; Lacau 1970, 149, #406; Wilson in PL) assume in it an m- pre"x form of Eg. 23 (phallus det.) “Mann” (OK, Wb V 344–5).
nb: The etymology of Eg. 23 (from *kl) is more or less evident. (1) G. Takács (1999,
39) combined it with SBrb.: NTuareg: Ghat pl. a-kal-en “gens”, SGhat dials. a-hel
< *a-kel [Bst. 1883, 324] !!! WCh.: (?) Sha ka(r)- “Leute von” [ Jng. 1970, 286] !!

Pero kpállè [kp- reg. < *kw-] “penis” [Frj. 1985, 37] !! CCh. *kwalV “penis” [GT]:

kw2la, Fali-Jilbu kw2làk$ | Nzangi kwÜr2, Mwulyen kwáàló | Kotoko-Makeri kòlí
(CCh.: Krf. quoted by Mkr. 1987, 284). For the semantic shift, cf. Eg. *mt “penis”
(above). Other etymologies for Eg. 23 are not acceptable. (3) Spiegelberg (1917,
96) derived it from a certain Eg. 23j “seminare” (sic) treated by him as the etymon
of Cpt. (S) Co, (B) jo “säen” (distinguished by Spiegelberg from the mng. “aus
senden” contra KHW 412), for which, however, cf. rather Dem. tj-šm “p#anzen”
(DG 506, 605). (4) Homburger’s (1928, 332) comparison of Eg. 23 with forms like
SCu.: Ma’a (Mbugu) mu-he, pl. wa-he “homme” etc. is just as well irreal. (5) C. T.
Hodge (1976, 16, n. 2) conjectured a relationship with Sem. *3ikr- “man, male” (!).
(6) HSED #1450: Eg. 23 ~ ECh.: Gabri k5e “child” (!).
" 2. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 168) connected it with Bed. m5d (m) “das männliche Schamglied” [Rn. 1895, 162] = m5d “penis” [Rpr. 1928, 213] = m5* (-*-!) “penis” [Dlg. 1972, 229] = mid “penis” [Hds. 1996, 89]. A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1967, 8, #4) erroneously extended this Eg.-Bed. comparison also to HECu.: Sidamo mutã “membrum virile” [Dlg.] = mut3 “membro virile” [Crl. 1938 II, 215] = mutá “membro virile” [Mrn. 1940, 231] = mutã [Hintze] = muta “penis (unpolite word)” [Gsp. 1983, 243; Hds. 1989, 387] = mut-3 “male genitalia” [Lsl.], although a direct genetic connection between the Sid. vs. Bed. words (on Cu. grounds) is impossible. Rejected by G. Takács (1999, 39).
nb1: For the AA background of Bed. m5d and the Sid. term see Eg. *mt “penis”
(above). The Bed.-Eg. comparison would be phonologically possible only if we assume
a late borrowing (in genetic cognates, Eg. 2 < *k + Bed. d), for which an attractive
parallel is to be found in Eg. fj2 “verlachen, für nicht achten” (XX., Wb I 576, 4)
= “être negligent” (AL 78.1570) = “to assail, deride, despise, be scornful” (DLE I
190) = “verlachen, verhöhnen, verspotten, verachten” (GHWb 305) identi"ed by
Zyhlarz (1932–33, 167) with Bed. f3"id ~ f3yd “(aus)lachen, verspotten” [Rn. 1895,
75] = f3yid “to laugh” [Rpr. 1928, 182] = f3yid “lachen” [Zhl.]. This would make
us suppose that NK 2 here represents in fact a dental plosive.
nb2: A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1967, 8, #4) compared Bed. m5d with a number of pho
nologically unacceptable cognates (Ar. ba*a«a “coire”, bu*«- “initus, vulva”, LECu.:
Saho-Afar m3»- “coire” and even bu**-1 “penis”, WCh.: Hausa buuraa “penis”,
Bole bola “penis”, sic), which has been critically commented in Takács 1999, 39.
" 3. GT: alternatively, GW m2 might perhaps indicate and represent the survival of a native Eg. word in the Volkssprache, namely that of Eg. *mt “penis” (discussed above), for which, nevertheless, a special LEg. “syllabic” orthography had to be invented due to the lack of its use in the orthography of the old Hochsprache. Another reason why it was not written with the “phallus” hrgl. may be that its identity with old Eg. *mt was no longer felt because of the anomalous LEg. -C2-, the odd secondary palatalization (?) of which remains at the
moment unexplained.

disproved by H. Schäfer (1906, 74–76) pointing out that the exx. of the det. from

daß der Sand ihm in etwas unnatürlich gezeichneter Kurve über den Kopf "iegt” (instead of
a bull “der in seiner stürmenden Kraft mit der an den Hörnern hängenden Fangleine dem Jäger
durchgegangen ist”). Similarly, L. Keimer (1943, 188) maintained that the "ghting bull
det. “représente un taureau qui fait jaillir sous son sabot un jet de sable. Ce sable ne peut être
perçu au même moment sur toute sa trajectoire telle qu’elle est représentée”. So also S. Sauneron
(1963, 51 pace Schäfer): “le taureau de combat, au moment où il frappe le sable ou la poussière

Hannig (GHWb): “à rapprocher de” 2pr2 (GW) “Streitwagen der Hethiter” (late NK, Wb V 364, 10) = 2pr.t (sic) “char de guerre” (AL) = 2pr “chariot” (DLE IV 109) = “bronze covered chariot” (Hoch 1994, 365, #542: borrowed from Akk.?) = 2pr2 ~ 2pr “*Lastkarren, Troßwagen”, n thr ~ “TeherKrieger der hethitischen Wagentruppe” (GHWb 952), which has also metal det. An Anatolian loan? But Meeks left the mng. of m2pr.t and the function of m- unexplained.
nb: Searching for a possible Anatolian source of LEg. 2pr.t, J. Puhvel (kind p.c., 12
April 2007), purely hypothetically and tentatively, would not exclude that a Hittite
"t might be zupparu-/zuppari- ’torch’ (cf. Akk. 9iparu “torch” [not listed in AHW
1392a]?), which would require an ex hypothesi second sense “war chariot”. Parallels
for the semantic change could be Hitt. tiyarit- “wagon” ~ Hurr. tiyari “spindle
or ’torch”, and Engl. ’torque’ (technical for “rotation”) < Lat. torques “twist” and
“torch” (hence French torche) < Vulgar Latin base vari. *torca. If the mng. “wheel(s)”
could be pars-pro-toto metonymy for “c(h)ar(iot)” (cf. Skt. rátha- “chariot” ~ Lat. rota
“wheel”, or Engl. “to get wheels” - “to buy a car”), so perhaps could “torque”
or “rotor” (cf. Myc. a-ko-so-ne > Gk.S*9"!7 “axles” alternating with a-mo-ta >
X(μ)%) “chariots” at Knossos).
" 2. J. Hoch (1994, 175–6, §234), in turn, saw in it an m- pre"x nomen instr. borrowed from Sem. re#ecting MHbr. m2passelet “plane, sculptor’s chisel”, NHbr. mapselet “chisel” < Hbr. psl “to hew”.

Dem.-Cpt. mjt and Eg. m2n, but no arguments were presented.
nb2: G. Burkard (1977, 21) erroneously explained also mj.t (fem.) “Weg, Straße” (late
NK, Wb, supra) from old m2n, which, however, may represent two distinct etymons
that were probably only confused as correctly surmised already by H. Smith (1978,
360). Note that this distinction was kept until Cpt., cf. Dem. mj.t (fem.) “1. Weg, 2.

different from that of Dem. mjt (masc., above) < LEg. mt < old m2n.
nb3: W. Schenkel’s (l.c. supra) rendering “Dammweg” (no evidence presented) seems
rather daring (cf. contra Kuhlmann 1992, 198, fn. 24). H.-W. Fischer-Elfert (1986,
177, n. d) pointed out the semantical difference between m2n vs. w3.t and mj.t “Weg”
rightly emphasizing that “eine semantische Wortfeld-Untersuchung wäre nötig”.

CCh. *kal- “to run, go quickly” [Orel] derived from AA *kal- “to move, go” (cf.
also HSED #1420, #1474), which is semantically dubious. The comparison of the
Brb.-Ar. isogloss with late Eg. 2n2n is due to G. Takács (1996, 52, #27).
nb2: The Ar. cognate suggested by A. Ju. Militarev (l.c.) is semantically dubious,
since its basic sense may be eventually different, cf. Ar. w3kil- “lent, paresseux, qui
a besoin de l’éperon et du fuet”, wukal-at- “impuissant, faible qui remet tout aux
soins des autres” [BK].
" 2. G. Fecht (1960, 180, §373) and J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 155) derived it directly from the LEg. hapax jtn “?” (Wb I 145, 14) = “marcher” (sic!) (Vrg.), which should be subject to further research.
nb1: With respect to its context ( j30.w jtn.w n r«, said of Osiris), it might be perhaps
identical rather to the late NK denom. verb jtn “(be)leuchten” (Mag. Pap. Harris
4:5, GHWb 112, cf. Wb I 145, 12) with a change of det.
nb2: W. Vycichl (DELC 109) assumed more carefully just a derivation of Eg. m2n
from a hypothetic OEg. *j2n “marcher” (without any reference to LEg. jtn).
" 3. P. Kaplony (1966, 80, §166) and K. P. Kuhlmann (1992, 198, fn. 24) saw in it “eine m-Bildung” of Eg. 2nj “erheben” (PT, Wb V 374–5, Kaplony: “wohl ‘vom Boden aufheben’, mit dem erhobenen Wurfholz der Vogeljagd determiniert”), which – according to Kuhlmann – “bezeichnet ursprünglich vielleicht den ‘aufgeworfenen Dammweg’, obwohl dies nach der Situation hier” (i.e., in the story of the Eloquent Peasant) “kaum der Fall sein wird ”, since “ein Dammweg erfordert einen Kanal auch jenseits der Straße” (not to be deduced from the examined passage). Kaplony also reconstructed a primary sense “erhobener (aufgeschütteter) Dammweg”. The mng. “Dammweg” and the same etymology (lit. “Erhobener”) was suggested by W. Schenkel (1999, 90 & fn. 37) too, who, in addition, extended the derivation from Eg. 2nj also to m2n “Führer” (lit. “Herausgehobener”).

m(n “der Führer auf dem Wege, bes. der Scheich der Beduinen” (MK, Wb II 176, 9–10) = “Sche(i)ch (?) oder Beduine” (Borchardt 1891, 63) = “sheikh (lit. path-"nder?)” (FD 122) = “guide chez les bédouins, khab5r” (DELC 109) = “Wegführer (bes. in der Wüste)” (GHWb 377; ÄWb II 1159).
nb1: For its occurence in Dyn. III see FÄW 203 (beside Ranke PN 167:19): “Weg

WD III 58); Kahl 1994, 730, #2265: “Führer”; Jones 2000, 453, #1696: “?”.
nb2: The title m2n in PT 952a has been rendered diversely, cf. Wb II 176, 11: “ein
Türhüter im Himmel (vgl. das vorsteh. Wort)”; ÜKAPT: “Wegewarte”; Fischer
1959, 263, fn. 71: “(designates) a doorkeeper of the netherworld”; AEPT 164 (cf.
Jones l.c. suggesting an erroneous rdg. m2n-w3.t): “Keeper of the Way”; ÄWb I

BIFAO 41, 1942, 16) = “to guide” (Gdk., RdE 38, 1987, 73, n. 49) supposed to
derive from the same root as a denom. verb.
! Its generally accepted rendering “Führer auf dem Wege” (maintained in the standard dictionaries, cf. e.g. Wb, FD, DELC, GHWb, FÄW, ÄWb, cf. esp. the Beleg ad Wb II 176, 9) suggests that it may be related with Eg. m2n “Weg” (OK, Wb, above) and eventually also with Eg. m2n “anweisen” (OK, Wb, below). ! Any other etymology is probably out of question. " 1. K. Sethe (ÜKAPT VI 135) surmised PT 952a m2n to represent an m- pre"x Berufsbezeichnung. H. G. Fischer (1959, 263, fn. 71), although rightly connected it with m2n “Plätze anweisen”, maintained the strange hypothesis that “it may be considered whether m2n ‘way’ is not a secondary (!) application of m2n ‘guide’ and whether the verb (!) m2n may not contain a preformative m + the verb 2nÕ ‘raise up, distinguish’ . . .” (hesitating to do so only because this derivation is “not among the examples listed by”

M. K. Feichtner 1932, 218f.). P. Kaplony (1966, 80, §167) too: 2nj “erheben” > m2n “Jäger mit dem erhobenen Wurfholz”. W. Schenkel (1999, 90 & fn. 38) derived m2n “Führer” directly (!) from Eg. 2nj “to raise” (supposing a basic sense “Herausgehobener”), whence, in addition, he explained also Eg. m2n “Dammweg” (sic) for which he suggested an original mng. “Erhobener”. " 2. GT: the coincidence of Eg. m2n < *mkn with Ar. makuna “avoir d’in#uence, du pouvoir, être homme considérable, jouir d’autorité”, II “établir qqn., surtout dans un poste élevé, donner à qqn. le pouvoir sur qqch.”, IV “1. établir qqn. comme chef et lui donner le pouvoir sur qqch.”, V “être puissant, in#uent, pouvoir beacoup, 2. pouvoir faire, être de force à faire telle ou telle chose, 3. se rendre maître de qqch. et avoir en son pouvoir”, mak5n-at- “3. autorité, pouvoir, in#uence dont on jouit auprès du prince, etc.” [BK II 1139–40] = makuna I “to be strong, powerful” [Zbr.] > ES: Tigre m2k2n “great hero, violent knight” [LH 133; Lsl. 1982, 51] may be purely accidental.
nb: The etymology of the Ar. root is disputed. Fagnan (1923, 165) took Ar. makuna
II “rendre maître de, donner comme territoire” to be a denom. verb of mak3n
(nomen loci < )kwn) “1. place, endroit, lieu, 2. place distinguée, élevée, rang élevé”
[BK II 1139]. For different (biconsonantal) inner Sem. etymology of Ar. mkn see
Zbr. 1971, 72, #119; Grande 1963, 15, 17.
" 3. GT: the same pertains to LECu.: Afar makawán, pl. makãw.n “Häuptling, Herrscher” [Rn. 1886, 881] = “chief, king” [Mkr.] erroneously equated by H.G. Mukarovsky (1987, 124) with a certain CCh.: Dghwede màgàná “chief, king” [Mkr.]. Both comparanda are clearly unrelated.
nb1: The Afar term seems to ultimately originate from ES *)kwn. But it is not
listed in Parker & Hayward 1985 unless – as suggested by D. Appleyard (p.c., 10
April 2007) – it is a poor transcription of mak3ban “elder, clan chief ”, the plural
of which is mak3bon ~ mak3bana, which may be an indigenous Afar term, as there
is no ES root it could derive from. Appleyard doubts if it could be a corruption of
Ge’ez & Amh. & Tna. mäkwännen “nobleman, of"cer” (< )kw-n-n).
nb2: On the other hand, the validity of the Dghwede form is controversial as Ch.
Kraft (1981 III, 112, #91) has Dghwede (Zeghvana) mù3àma “king”.
" 4. GT: that Ar. malk- “3. milieu ou le bord du chemin”, milk- “milieu du chemin” [BK II 1151] may eventually stem from Ar. malik- “king” on the basis of the function of king as guide or leader (A. M-celaru, p.c. 22 April 2004), may only be relevant as typological parallel but hardly as a genetic one.

nb1: R. O. Faulkner (AECT I 172, spell 215, n. 13) considered the mng. of m2n in
CT III 188a as obscure and, henceforth, he regarded its connection with m2n of
PT 2040 as “hardly” possible. D. Meeks (AL 78.1921), in turn, rendered it “prendre,
saisir (lit. élever dans sa main)” (suggesting a derivation from 2nj “to raise”).
nb2: P. Kaplony (LÄ II 1119, 13) rendered m2n in the Theology of Memphis (l.

he explained from Eg. 2nj).
! The same verbal root may be present in *m2n > mtn “1. jem. mit etwas (m) beschenken, belohnen, 2. mit etwas versehen” (XVIII., Wb II 170, 11–12; GHWb 374; JW 1996, 521: LP; WD I 98; ÄWb II 1157: XVII.) = “to reward” (FD 121) = “belohnen, angesehen sein” (!) (NBÄ 90). ! Hence (as deverbal as suggested in Snk. 1983, 225): (1) m2n.wt ~ mtn.wt > mtnj.t “Belohnung, Entlohnung (für eine Arbeit oder Herstellung eines Objekts)” (CT, Wb II 170, 14; GHWb 374–5; JW 1996, 521: LP) = “reward (used of such high rewards as might, victory, and jubilees bestowed by gods)” (Caminos 1954 LEM, 31; FD 121) = “Belohnung, Ansehen” (NBÄ 90) = “Belohnung, Ansehen” (Snk. 1983, 225) = “Abzeichen” (Snk. 1999, 90: CT I 29c, VII 162bf ) = “reward, indication, sign” (DCT 189–190) = “1. Belohnung, Entlohnung (für eine Arbeit oder Herstellung eines Objekts), 2. Abzeichen” (ÄWb II 1157).
nb1: Its OK attestation is problematic. J. Osing (NBÄ 90 vs. 563, n. 427) and
D. Meeks (2005, 246, #575a) projected the sense “Belohnung” to OK m2n.t
“Unterhalt (?)” (Wb II 176, 12 after LD II 103, cf. also Pusch 1974, 21 after Junker:
Giza V 51) considered to be merely “une graphie ancienne de” NK mtn.wt. K. Sethe,
followed by R. O. Faulkner R. van der Molen (DCT 189) rendered PT 161b m2n.t
as “Besoldung” (ÜKAPT 135) = “grant (?)” (AEPT 45). Others, however, conceive
it as m prep. + 2n.t “Unterschied” (ÄWb I 1450: cf. Spiegel 1971, 187).
nb2: It has long been uncertain whether an original -t- or -2- is to be read in this
word. Most of the standard dictionaries (Wb, FD, most recently even GHWb,
ÄWb II) list it with -t- (!) (even despite mentioning the var. m2n.wt beside mtn.wt).
In the majority of the CT occurrences, the word is written as m2n.wt (CT I 29c,
II 204a, II 151e, VII 162bf ) ~ var. mtn.jt (CT I 29c), cf. also the underlying verb
m2n (CT VII 152l, VII 153g). In the light of the supposed OK etymon m2n.t and
the CT vars. with -2- (above), J. Osing (1976, 90, 563, fn. 427) treated CT m2n.wt
as the primary form.

Schenkel (1999, 90) too supposed a pre"x m- pre"x but without naming the underlying root.

GT: its comparison with Ar. mkn II & IV “établir qqn. comme (chef ), donner (à qqn. le pouvoir sur qqch.)” [BK II 1139] = IV “arranger, ordonner” [Dozy II 607] = “in die Hand geben” [Wehr apud Behnstedt], Yemeni Ar. mkn: yemakkan (impf.) “übergeben, übermitteln” [Behnstedt 1993, 197] = mkn II («al3) “to give, hand
over” [Piamenta 1990, 470] is not to be excluded.
nb: The Ar. root seems, however, to be of denom. origin, cf. Ar. makuna I “avoir
de l’in#uence, du pouvoir” < mak3n-at- “1. place, 2. état, 3. pouvoir, in#uence,
autorité”, mak5n-at- “2. état de ce qui est établi solidement, 3. pouvoir, in#uence,
autorité” [BK II 1139–40]. Therefore, this Eg.-Ar. would ultimately imply having
to assume an eventual etymological connection to Ar. kwn: k3na “1. être, 2. avoir
lieu” [BK II 945].

nb2: The widespread assumption, proposed by H. Kronasser (1958, 127), Laroche
(1960, 200, fn. 3), M. Mayrhofer (1960, 143, fn. 58; 1961, 453; KEWA II 545–6),
and W. von Soden (1965, cf. KB 545; O’Connor 1989, 29, fn. 28), that the Akk. word
eventually originates from OIndic maghá-m (n) “Gabe, Geschenk, Lohn, Reichtum
(gift, reward, wealth)” [KEWA] via Hurrian makanni- “Geschenk” [Kronasser] (cf.
the Hurr. ending -nnu), has been recently doubted and rejected by several authors.
E. Laroche (1980, 164): “l’origine indo-arienne . . . n’est pas évidente. . . . Il peut s’agit de la racine
sémitique mgn”. A. Kammenhuber (1968, 222–9) maintained a native Hurrian (not
IE) origin of the stem magan- (!) leaving to Semitists to decide if it was eventually
Semitic. M. O’Connor (1989, 25, 29–30, §5) insisted that Sem. *mgn is “relatively
rare, but well enough documented across a variety of languages to ensure” that the Hurrian
word came from Sem. (not vice versa) and that W. von Soden’s hypothesis “is no more
tenable”. W. G. E. Watson (1995, 547) too, has admitted (pace M. Salvini) that the
Sem. root “is not necessarily a loan from Indo-Aryan” (Watson 2000 MS, 3, §26 lists fur
ther lit. for a Hurr./Vedic/Sem. origin). Whether Hurr. maganna (ma-ka-a-an-na)
of the Mitanni letter (Laroche 1980, 164: absolutive sg. of maganni + poss. pron.
of 3rd p.sg.: “son présent”, cf. Wilhelm, Or. NS 54, 1985, 487; others: absolutive
pl.) is Vedic or Sem., was discussed rather “inconclusively” (Watson 1999, 789, §26)
by Giorgieri and Röseler (1996, 282–3, esp. fn. 3–4), who conceived the Hurr. stem
maganni (Schuler) = magan- (Kammenhuber, Farber, Girbal) = mag3nni (Giorgieri
and Röseler) as an essive “als Geschenk”. W. G. E. Watson (1999, 131) only sup
posed that Ug. mgn belongs to the group of words that “may have been borrowed back
from the language which initially borrowed them” .
" 5. GT: on the other hand, its connection with Eg. 2wn “belohnen” (GR, Wb V 360, 2) = “to reward” (PL 1161) vs. 2wn “Zuwendung o.ä., Geschenk” (Wb V 360, 1) = “reward, gift” (PL) seems less likely. Note that LEg. mtwn (m) “reward (?)” (,erný, JEA 31, 1945, 33, n. l; DLE I 252) has been explained by R. Caminos (1954 LEM, 31) directly from MK m2n.wt, although the derivation from (or contamination with) an old var. *2wn is not to be ruled out either.
nb1: In principle, NK 2wn < OK *2nj (?) “to reward” cannot be excluded (from
which, however, it would be dif"cult to explain PT m2n “anweisen”, Wb), cf. Eg. 2wn
“Unterschied, Differenz” (Math., Wb V 360, 3) < 2n.t “Unterschied” (XVIII., Wb
V 376, 1; ÄWb I 1450: already PT?). Note that the GR verb 2wn (twn) might be
alternatively explained as a late wtg. of Eg. dwn “ausstrecken” > “jem. beschenken
mit (m) etwas” (LP, GR, Wb V 431, 17) = “1. to extend, 2. offer, 3. reward” (PL
1188). Nevertheless, this can hardly be true about NK 2wn.
nb2: For Eg. 2wn (if from *kwn) cf. perhaps WCh. *ky-n “to give” [GT] attested in
Angas-Sura *'in " *)in (from *kin?) “to give” [GT 2004, 52]: Sura 'ìn “geben”
[ Jng. 1963, 61] = 'ìn “to give” [Krf.], Mpn. 'ín ~ sín “to give” [Frj. 1991, 56, 10],

“to give” [Skn.] | Boghom kyay “to give” [Smz.] (WCh.: JI 1994 II, 158).

But in this case Eg. mtn.wt could hardly be the same deverbal m- pre"x form (from a not attested Eg. *ntn) as e.g. Hbr. matt3n(3).

Sem. root akin to Ar. dyn “prêter, rétribuer” [BK I 757], Jbl. edyín “to lend” [ Jns.

Sem. *malk- “ruler, king” (Hnrg. 2000, 2065). A. M-celaru (p.c., 22 April 2004),
treats Ar. malaka as secondary denom. verb from Ar. malik- “king” (lit. “the one

tions) in GR mdn.w a fully distinct root (old 3nj), cf. Eg. *m3nj.t (infra).
nb2: On the other hand, it is even less likely that GR mdn.w has anything to do
with Eg. mdn-0s “aiguisoir à rasoir” (MK 1x, Jéquier 1921, 127 & fn. 8) = “un

! Original spelling (-2-/-t-?) and etymology uncertain. In any case, it is probably an m- pre"x nomen instr., but the underlying root is not evident. At the moment, most likely seems #3. " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 9) and G. Jéquier (1921, 152) derived MK mtn. jt from Eg. dn “abschneiden, verstümmeln” (MK, Wb V 463, 7–8) = “couper, tailler, séparer” ( Jéquier), cf. also dndn “abschneiden” (BD, Wb V 465–6). This cannot be accepted without “phonological reservations” as rightly thought by G. Jéquier (l.c.), whose lit. rendering “(arme) pour trancher” (with an m- of dat., sic!) is baseless. The relationship with MK dn could only be possible if we assume a rare interchange of CT -t- ~ -d- (albeit ~ -2- would be rather odd, but not excluded).
nb: A number of authors (Grapow 1914, 33; Jéquier 1921, 153; SISAJa II, #158)
derived GR mdn.w from MK dn, which can only hold true if we either accept the
MK var. mtn.jt (~ *mdn.jt) as primary and the -2- of m2n.wt as purely orthographic
(rather improbable) and treat GR mdn.w as a distinct lexeme separate from MK
mtn.jt < m2n.wt (unlikely)
" 2. H. Smith (1979, 163), in turn, speculated whether it was perhaps an m- pre"x derivative of Eg. tnj “(Substantiv als Bez. des Königs im Kampf )” (XX., Wb V 311, 3) and tnj “(re#.) sich messen mit (%n«)
jem. (im Kampf )” (XX., Wb V 311, 4) = “to measure o’self with s’body in battle” (Smith), which have, however, probably nothing to do with our word for “knife”. Declined already by P. Wilson (PL 476) as “unlikely”. " 3. GT: if its root contained originally a -2-, there appear two CT verbs that might be relevant, but their rendering is rather debated and, henceforth, the etymology based on them remains uncertain, cf. CT II 112b 2nj “to lift up (bonds)” (AECT I 102, spell 105) = “to remove (fetters)” (DCT 760) = “zerschneiden (auch Fleisch in Scheiben); *markieren” (ÄWb II 2744) vs. CT VII 214k 2n (knife det.) “to sculpt (?)

nb: Already W. Schenkel (1999, 90) analyzed CT VII 17v (very suggestively) as m
2n.wt with a lit. mng. “Trenner”, but he failed to identify the underlying root.

nb1: The etymology of the Hbr./Can. root has been controversial in Sem. studies.
Levy (l.c.) took (PB)Hbr. msk from an OHbr. Grundwurzel *ms- > mss. Jastrow (l.c.),
in turn, derived Hbr. mesek from a root attested in PBHbr. skk (or swk) nitpo. “to
be enlightened” [ Jastrow 1950, 990]. Graetz (quoted by Loretz 1993, 258) consid
ered Hbr. msk (only “gießen”, not “mischen”) secondary from mzg “nach Analogie
des griechischen μ&?3+&" ‘Wein mit Wasser mischen’ gebildet”. A. S. Kaye (1991, 834, fn. 6)
768 m&k



assumed Hbr. msk to be an irregular (instead Hbr. *mGg) re#ex of Ar. mašaCa “to
mix” that was in#uenced (“semiotically realigned”) by Hbr. nsk “to pour”. But most
recently, Loretz (1993, 254–6) convincingly demonstrated the validity of OHbr.
msk as a primary root inherited a common Ug.-Hbr. *)msk “Wein mischen”.
gt: although the AA etymology of Can. *msk is not clear, cp. perhaps LECu.:
Afar mosok (m) “becoming soft (adoucissement)”, mosòk-e*«e “to fall into pieces,
decompose, disintegrate”, mosoke ~ musuke “become soft through boiling or much
wear” [PH 1985, 170].
nb2: Most of the authors dealing with the Sem. etymology of the Dem.-Cpt. term
(e.g., CD l.c., KHW l.c., Smith l.c., Wittmann l.c., most recently Quack 2005,
314) explained at the same time Dem. m2k etc. also from Sem. *mzg (making no
distinction from Hbr. msk), which, however, can hardly be accepted on phonological
grounds (LP -2- < Can. *s vs. LP -k < Can. *-k). Can. *msk may only be regarded
as a distantly related var. to Sem. *mzg, cf. Hbr. mezeg ~ -k “mixed wine, spiced
wine (meaning sperm)” [KB 564] = “Mischwein” [Graetz/Loretz] = “punch”
[Pope/Loretz], MHbr. & JAram. mzg “mischen”, PBHbr. mezeg “Mischwein” vs.

l’autre, l’un à l’autre” [BK II 1098] (Sem.: Möller 1911, 161). The etymology of
Sem. *mzg has also been debated. The old comparison of Hbr.-Arm. mzg with Akk.
mzq “saugen” [AHW 637] = “to suck” [CAD m1, 437] has been riqhtly queried by
by Wagner (BZAW 96, 1966, 73–74, #157, cf. Loretz 1993, 249, fn. 19). GB 410
eventually derived Hbr. mzg from Akk. muz5qu ~ munziqu “Rosine” [AHW 692]
= muz5qu “raisin” [CAD m2, 322] = munzi/uqu [GB], while Drower & Macuch
(1963, 264) assumed the following chain of borrowing: Ar. mzC (and also mšC!) <
Aram. mzg < Akk. munziqu “mixed wine” deriving from naz3qu ~ mussuku (mng.
obscure). Loretz (1993, 248–9) too supposed Hbr. mzg to have been borrowed from
Aram. mzg. GT: if, however, Sem. *mzg represents a primary (non-derived) root,
cf. CCh.: Buduma madegey [-d- < AA *-„-?] “mélanger” [Gaudiche 1938, 29]. W.
Vycichl (2005, 58) saw in WBrb.: Zng. u-mKeg-en (pl.) “les mélangés ou le "ltrés

770 m&t – md3



! GT: perhaps related to Ug. mdl I “to saddle, prepare a mount for a rider” [Gordon 1955, 286, #1068] = “Gespann (yoke, harness)”, denom. mdl “anschirren, satteln” [WUS #744a] = mdl “to tie, attach (?)” [Green"eld 1964, 527f.] = mdl “to attach a guide rope”, mdl “a guide rope (a rope to guide the ridden animals)” [Good, UF 16, 1984, 77–81] = mdl “strap, halter, a strip of tanned leather”, denom. mdl “to strap (or the like), put on or attach a halter (to an ass), tie a lead-rope to a donkey” [Watson 1986, 73–74; 1996, 76, §6; cf. also 1986, 18] = mdl G/D “to bridle”, mdl “part of the harness (?)” [DUL 527: etym. uncertain].
nb1: Although the rendering of Ug. mdl by diverse authors is quite coherent, its
Sem. etymology has been highly disputed. Aistleitner (WUS #744a) took the Ug.
verb mdl (as denom.) from Ug. mdl (noun) that he treated as nomen instr. of Ug. dll
D “erniedrigen, verachten”. Green"eld (l.c.), following Goshen-Gottstein (Biblica 41,
1960, 64–66), however, assumed a primary (not denom.) Ug. verbal root mdl akin
to Hbr.-Aram. *lmd “to tie, bind, tog” via met. (which has been partly accepted
by Margalit l.c.). Good (l.c.) also supposed a denom. verb in Ug. stemming from a
nomen instr. cognate to Aram. dallel “to lead” and Ar. dalla “to guide an animal”,
arguing that that “ridden animals ordinarily were not s a d d l e d in the Late Bronze Age”
adding that “the only piece of equipment a Late Bronze Age rider would need was a rope to
guide the ridden animals” (Good 1984: 80). Watson (1986, 73), in turn, was disposed
to assume rather a primary root mdl in the light of two alternative Akk. parallels:
(1) Akk. mad3lu “to salt, pickle meat” hence Ug. mdl lit. “a strip of tanned leather,
i.e., animal hide or skin treated with oil or salt” or (2) Akk. muddulû “elastischer
Streifen, Band” [Butz, JESHO 27, 1984, 305, n. 144: “kaum von muddulu abgeleitet”]
= “elastic strip” [Watson 1986, 76, n. 13], Ebla ma-da-LUM “(most probably) a
bridle or guide-rope of some kind (and certainly not such an expensive item as
a saddle, in an “equine” context, list of equipment) [Watson]. Al-Yasin (quoted
by Margalit 1984, 133, §xii) compared Ug. mdl with Ar. mdl V: tamaddala “to
enwrap” [Al-Yasin] = “to wrap” [Gordon] (not so in BK II 1078: “s’essuyer avec
une serviette”), which was endorsed by Olmo Lete (apud Margalit), but Margalit
preferred to explain Ar. mdl from Lat. manti/ele (pace Kopf, BiOr 12, 1955, 135).
As an alternative solution, Watson (forthcoming, kind p.c., 11 April 2007) suggests
that Ug. mdl may be compared with Akk. nadd/ttullu [AHW 703] = nattullu “(part
of a harness)” [CAD n2, 120–121] or “reins” [Adler, Görg] and Ebla na-da-lum
“oggetti per carri e cavalli” [Conti] = “part of the harness or else reins” [Watson].
For the correspondence of Ug. m- ~ Akk. n-, Watson lists Ug. mÕsp-t “a container”
~ Akk. n1septu, Ug. m3rn “a weapon” ~ Akk. nam)3ru, Ug. mlbš “cape” ~ Akk.
nalbašu, Ug. mpt% “key” ~ Akk. naptû, Ug. mrkbt “chariot” ~ Akk. narkabtu, Ug.
mšlm “pay” ~ Akk. našlamtu, Ug. mtn, “gift” ~ Akk. nidin/ttu and nidnu (see also
Tropper 2000, 155), but these exx. of a secondary delabialization in Akk. (in the
proximity of a labial consonant) can hardly be relevent in our case. GT: for Ar. mdl
cp. perhaps rather Brb. *m-d-l “to cover, close” [GT]: NBrb.: Mzab Qbl. e-mdel
“fermer (sans verrou)” [Dlt. 1982, 486] !! EBrb.: Gdm. e-md2l “fermer (les yeux),
être fermé (yeux), être caché par les nuages (soleil)” [Lanfry 1973, 205, #975].
nb2: Reinisch (1890, 257) rendered Eg. md3 as “Lederschurz” (!) and combined it
with a number of phonogically clearly false and unacceptable comparanda.
nb3: Less likely is a connection with NBrb.: Mzg. )m-d-r: ta-madar-t, pl. ti-madar
in “corde (de métier à tisser) qui sert à "xer l’ensouple enrouleuse aux extrémités

" 5. A. R. Bomhard (1981, 446; 1984, 271, §273) erroneously combined Dem. mtw with Eg. mt.t “middle” and even IE *me/2/at“middle, in the midst of, with, among”. Absurd.
mdj “Bez. des Seth” vs. mtj “als Bez. für Seth: das Böse o.ä.” (GR, Wb II 177, 21 vs. II 169, 15) = “Mede, used of Seth in Edfu as a term of abuse with a nationalistic mng.” (Grif"ths 1979, 177, cf. also LÄ III 57) = “le Mède (epithète de Seth)” (AL 79.1423 pace Grif"ths) = “als Schmähname des Seth” (Spycher, LÄ IV 357) = “das von Horus für Seth benutzte Schimpfwort: Medjai (!)” (Kurth 1992, 374, fn. 12) = “an abusive term for Seth (often at Edfu): the foreigner, the outsider par excellence” (PL 478) = “(vermutlich) Meder (gemeint ist)” (Peust 1999 Nap., 213).
nb1: P. Wilson (PL) listed two supposed exx. of Eg. mdj (in a dif"cult passage of
the Myth of Horus: Edfu VI 214:12 & VI 215:2–3) also s.v. m33j (q.v.), “où ils sont
effectivement mieux à leur place” in the opinion of D. Meeks (1999, 581), who, in addi
tion, regarded it not at all certain that GR mdj signi"es “the Mede” (cf. Enchoria
17, 161–2; BIFAO 89, 85), since “en fait les graphies tardives de m33j désignant un corps
de police ont souvent été comprises comme désignant, à tort, les Mèdes”, although C. Peust
(1999, 214) has at the same time arrived just at the opposite conclusion “dass das
neuägyptische m33j ‘Polizist’ im späteren Ägyptischen nicht fortlebt”. A.H. Gardiner (AEO
I 82*, 88*) too, found it “doubtful if there is any instance of M33j in the true meaning
‘Nubians’ after Dyn. XVIII” admitting (pace Kees 1930) that “in the Legend of Horus at
Edfu, . . . Mdj certainly alludes to the Persians”. Following him K. Zibelius (1972, 136–7)
also denied the survival of m33j after Dyn. XX claiming that this term “im Koptischen
ist überhaupt nicht belegt” (see below).
nb2: Vocalized as *madåj by J. Osing (NBÄ 361–3, n. 39 pace Till 1931, §27).
! Rendering still debated. The identity of all exx. listed in PL 478 is also uncertain. " 1. Usually rendered (following H. Kees quoted below) “as ‘Mede’ being an allusion to the recently departed Persian overlords of Egypt” (PL), which “re"ects the phase of Persian domination at least in one point of terminology” (Grif"ths, LÄ), i.e., it is “an impress of the expulsion of the Hyksos and the Persians” (Grif"ths 1979). The direct source may be PBHbr./JAram. m3day “Medien”, m3diyy5 “der Meder” [Levy 1924 III 29–30] = m3dãy (sic) “Meder, Perser” [Osing, NBÄ 361, n. 39]. At the moment, this seems to be the most convincing etymology, albeit not fully certain.

= “Persia, Persian, lit. Mede” (CED), whence most authors (e.g., Grif"th 1909 III,
319; Sethe 1916, 124–131; 1923, 169; Spg. KHW 66; Kees 1930, 346–7; AEO I

Peust 1999 Nap., 213–4; Quack 2005, 314) have derived Cpt. (SB) matoi, (SL)
matoei, (F) matai (m) “soldier” (CD 190b) referring originally, in H.S. Smith’s
(l.c.) view, to the class of professional Persian soldiers. Earlier, the Cpt. term was
explained from Eg. m33j “policeman etc.” (infra). Trying to resolve the semantic
dif"culties (caused by the elimination of old m33j as the alternative etymon of the
Cpt. term), C. Peust (1999 Nap., 214) has supposed that “das lautlich klar als solches
ausgewiesene Lehnwort mdy / matoi ‘Perser’ hat, vermutlich in der Epoche der persischen
Besetzung Ägyptens, eine zweite Bedeutung ‘Soldat’ (!) angenommen”. The Cpt. forms can
hardly be explained from *m3d-j as "gured by K. Sethe (l.c.). Instead, W. Vycichl
(DELC 125 pace Lacau) has assumed *matáj, pl. *mató3j (sic, *-3j), although he
denied the etymological connection with NK m33j. The etymology of the Cpt.
term has not been void of controversies, since it was earlier derived from Eg. m33j
(q.v.). As a compromise, some authors surmised that Cpt. (SB) matoi etc. “ist aus
den lautlich zusammengefallenen Begriffen mdj ‘Meder’ und m33j ‘m33j-Nubier’ entstanden”
(Kaplony, LÄ V 271, n. 15 pace DG 195; Hodge 1969, 11–12; KHW 105; DELC
125), i.e., via contamination of both lexemes, cf. Dem. m3w ~ m3j ~ mtj “Soldat,
auch: Polizist (später mit mtj ‘Meder’ zusammengefallen)” (DG 195:1). P. Wilson
(PL) took (rather equivocally) a position that one can hardly follow: “the basis of m33Õ
for matoi is clear enough (!) and if m33y is taken as a word for foreigners in general then this
may also be the term at the root of mdy . . . It is possible that in this passage the term already has
the meaning matoi”. J. ,erný’s (CED 93) allegation that Wb II 86, 4 “confuses mdy
with the African people m33y!” is somewhat misleading, since the relevant Belegstellen
have evidently m33j. Moreover, the authors of Wb (l.c.) have clearly denied the
connection of the Cpt. word with Eg. m33j: “vermutlich nicht das Kopt. matoi” (Vrg.
1950, 294: “sans doute à bon droit”).
" 2. D. Kurth (1992, 374, fn. 12) rendered mdj of Edfu VI 214:12 as an instance of m33j “Medjai”, while he saw in mdj of Edfu VI 215:2–3 a term of abuse rendered as “Wüstling (?)” but regarded as related (!) to m23 “das männliche Glied” (late NK-GR, Wb II 175, 5), noting (quite obscurely), however, that “der annähernde Gleichklang der beiden Schimpfwörter (i.e., mdj vs. m23) ist sicher kein Zufall”. Discussing the quoted passge of the Edfu Myth of Horus, P. Wilson (PL 478) too surmised that mdj “here may be the country m33y which supplied mercenary soldiers to Egypt and her police force”.

(Edfu) a term for the staff of Horus which he uses to smite foes and also for his harpoon” (PL 479).
nb1: Although reliefs, paintings, and statuary normally show the larger end of the
mdw-staff upward, the orientation of the staff in writing became standard with this
end downward presumably re#ecting the way the staff was originally held down to
Cheops’ reign (Fischer 1977, §45; 1978, 160). For the scenes in MK tomb chapels
showing a device in the production of mdw-staves (where these were straightened
rather than bent) cf. Fischer 1978, 158.
nb2: W. Spiegelberg (1923, 150–1) tried to demonstrate that Eg. mdw was “eig. auch
die Bezeichnung des Feuerbohrers” supposing that “was in den älteren Formen der Hieroglyphe

sowohl für den Spazierstock wie den Bohrer zweckmässig war”. Whether the late evidence
of the Edfu Calendar (l. 20: jnj s3.t sjn mdw “Bringer der Flamme, der den Bohrer
reibt”, cf. Lemm, ZÄS 25, 1887, 114) can be projected to predynastic times, has to

Fischer-Elfert (1992, 41–42 & fn. 38) assumed in it a typological parallel to Eg. jmj.t-r “Stab, Würdezeichen des Beamten” (conceived by him as a reverse nisbe, lit. “das, in dem sich der Ausspruch be"ndet”), since “ein Beamter, der einen dieser beiden Stäbe in der Hand führt, verfügt Kraft seines Amtes und dieses Machtattributs auch über die entsprechende Potenz des ‘Wortes’, . . . des ‘befehlenden . . . Ausspruches’ ”. The fact that it is sometimes combined in Eg. texts with Eg. mdw “sprechen” (in the Tanis “Sign Pap.”, e.g., mdw “Stab” is glossed by ns n mdw “sprechende Zunge”, cf. Wb II 180, 12), led Fischer-Elfert to stating that “ein Wortspiel im Sinne einer etymologischen Beziehung zwischen beiden Lexemen anzunehmen scheint unausweichlich”, which represents in fact a typical instance of adopting an old an Eg.

nb1: The etymology of the Hbr. parallel has been strongly debated. (1) Tradition
ally (GB 417; Gordon l.c.; Djk. & Kogan 1995, 16, #1807; KB 573; Tropper 2000,
198) it (recently along with Ug. m9) has been derived from Hbr. n9y qal “1. aus
strecken (einen Stab, ein Schwert, die Hand, um ein Zeichen zu geben, als Gestus
des Drohens usw.), 2. ausspannen (die Meßschnur, ein Zelt, den Himmel usw.),
3. neigen (niederwärts, die Füße jem. zum Fallen, eine Wand, den Himmel usw.),
4. (intr.) rechts oder links abbiegen vom Wege, abweichen” [GB 500] = “1. to reach
out (staff, sword, hand etc.), 2. spread out (tent), lay (measuring cord), stretch out
(heaven), 3. bow down low, 4. (intr.) stretch out, become long, turn aside, away from,
bend, incline, join together with, follow after, support, devote o’self to, be inclined to”
[KB 692–3], which, on the other hand, cannot be the root of Eg. mdw. L. Kogan
(2000, 726) rightly regarded the derivation from Hbr.-Ug. *n9w as “not so certain”
(although Hbr. ma99eh < *)n9w “is clear from its structure”), Hbr. n9y being semantically
“not very suitable to develop into ‘stick, staff’, although both the noun and the verb appear in close
connection in Ex. 9:23”. He found a connection with Akk. na9û ~ -d- ~ -t- “schla
gen” [AHW 768] = “to hit, beat” [CAD n2, 132] semantically better, although he
admitted that the derivation from a basic verb attested only in another language
may be problematic. (2) Alternatively, the Hbr. word was explained (in KB l.c. and
Muchiki 1999, 249) as a loan from Eg. mdw, whereby Y. Muchiki regarded Hbr. -eh
as a trace of the dropped Eg. -w. (3) As remarked by L. Kogan (l.c.), “the picture is
more complicated with” OAkk. mi99um “battle-mace” [Gelb 1973, 187] > Akk. mi99u ~
m59u ~ m19u “eine Götterwaffe” [AHW 664] = mi99u “mace” [AHW m2, 147] and
Hbr. m.9 ~ m.93 “1. Tragstange, Tragesstelle, bestehend aus mehreren dergleichen
Stangen, 2. Joch” [GB 404] = m.9 “1. carrying-frame, 2. pole” vs. m.93 “1. yoke,
2. carrying-pole” [KB 555], which have also been equated (in DUL 602 and DL
2003, 169) with the Ug.-Hbr. term, although neither can derive from a IIIae -w/y
or Iae n- root. A.Ju. Militarev (2005, 597, §90) too both Hbr. ma99eh (!) and Akk.
mi99u from a Sem. *ma/i99- “branch, rod, stick”. Seeing these controversies (without
resolving them), L. Kogan concluded that “I must therefore admit that the criticism against
Orel and Stolbova’s comparison of Hebrew ma99ä and Eg. mdw . . . expressed in Diakonoff and
Kogan 1996:34 was not fully justi!ed . . .”. This is surprising, since V. Orel, who ignored
elementary rules of Hbr. historical morphology and misquoted the Hbr. word as
ma9e (sic), derived it from Sem. *ma9- (sic), which he based, in addition, solely on
the Hbr. word. So, Orel’s arti"cial Sem. *ma9- and AA *mu9- were righly rejected
by I. M. Diakonoff & L. Kogan (1995, 16, #1807; 1996, 34, #1807).
nb2: V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED 379–380, #1750), followed by A.Ju. Militarev
(2005, 381, §90; 2005, 597, §90), eventually combined the Eg.-Hbr. parallel with AA
*maw/ya9- “tree” [OS] = *may9- [Mlt.] based on the erroneous equation of ECu.
*may9- “palm tree” [Mlt.]: Orm. m195 “palm tree” [Gragg 1982, 284] !!! CCh. *mV9
“baobab” [OS] !! ECh.: Mkl. mòoté (m) “arbre sp., donne des fruits très sucrés”
[ Jng. 1990, 141], whose resemblance is due to pure chance. Militarev’s (2005, 381,
§90) PSem. *mVy9- (sic) (no re#exes mentioned) seems to be a creatio ex nihil.
" 3. G. Farina (1924, 324) connected Eg. mdw with Sem. *maw9“bastone” (sic).
nb: Based on Hbr. m.9 ~ m.93 “1. Tragstange, Tragesstelle, bestehend aus mehreren
dergleichen Stangen, 2. Joch” [GB 404] = m.9 “1. carrying-frame, 2. pole” vs. m.93
“1. yoke, 2. carrying-pole” [KB 555], which, however, might have been borrowed
from LEg. m3wd < old m3w3 (q.v.).
" 4. W. A. Ward (1968, 68) compared Eg. mdw alternatively with Sem. *mdd “to stretch out, measure” (Sem.: Lsl. 1969, 19; Zbr. 1971, #138). Semantically less probable. " 5. A.Ju. Militarev (2005, 381, §90; 2005, 597, §90) compared it (among other parallels that cannot be connected, cf. above) to NOm.

! As pointed out by Sh. Yeivin (1933, 108; 1936, 71–72, #18), it re#ects act. *mtn (or represents a var. with -d- akin to it) that may be cognate with Sem. *mtn “to be strong, "rm " "rmly established, immobile” [Yeivin]: PBHbr. mtn hi"l “1. warten, 2. vorsichtig sein” vs. JAram. mtn peal “1. (er)warten, 2. vorsichtig sein” [Dalman 1922, 259] = PBHbr. mtn hi"l “abwarten, harren (eig. wohl fest sein)” [Levy 1924 III 297] = PBHbr. mtn qal “to be long, slow, wait esp. to lie over for complete ripening”, hi"l “1. to last, remain fresh, 2. keep, let (fruits) lie over, 3. wait, tarry, postpone, 4. be slow, patient” vs. JAram. mtn peal “to cause delay, let wait”, afel “to tarry, remain, wait” [ Jastrow 1950, 863], NHbr. mtn “to delay, wait, be slow”, m3t$n “careful, sedate, slow” [Yeivin], Samar. Aram. mtn “tranquility, waiting, rest” [DNWSI 492], JPAram. mtn “to wait” [Sokoloff 1990, 337], Syr. mat5nå “être indolent, doux” [Lsl.] !! Ar. matana “8. s’arrêter dans un lieu”, matuna “être ferme, solide, robuste et résister aux fatigues”, cf. perhaps also madana “1. se "xer, s’établir dans un lieu” [BK II 1058, 1079] = matuna I “fest, stark, solide sein”, matn- ~ mat5n“fest, stark, solide” [Wehr 1952, 793] = matina “to be strong, solid, "rm” [Yeivin] !! (?) Sqt. mí9en-hon [perhaps < *mitenhon] “mou” [Lsl. 1938, 242] (Sem.: Kopf 1976, 148 with parallels for “strong” vs. “to wait”).
nb1: In Yeivin’s (l.c.) view, a direct borrowing of Eg. mdn from Can. is not likely,
while C. Peust (1999, 308, fn. 415–6), who also considered this Eg.-Sem. etymology
“very probable”, attributed the just the opposite to Yeivin (as if he had “hesitatingly
taken” this parallel as a LEg. < Sem. loan). GT: in the light of the irreg. Eg. -d- and
the lack of GW, a genetic cognacy seems more probable.
nb2: Any other etymology is out of question. (1) C. Ceugney (1880, 9) analyzed it
as m- pre"x + tnw (no mng. provided). (2) W. Vycichl (1933, 180), in turn, derived
LEg. mdn (perhaps *mjdn) from *jdn “hören” (sic), which cannot be justi"ed at
all, because the extinct Eg. *jdn may have only meant “ear” (cf. Gilula 1975, 251;
Vcl. 1985, 172, §1) and by no means “to be silent”. The ear det. in mdn does not
necessarily indicate an etymological connection. It may be purely due rather to the
in#uence of the orthography of the words containing the sequence ( j)dn (cf. Wb I
154; V 463, 6 & 466, 3 & 470, 2–3).

nb: No pre-Cpt. evidence is available. In principle, both old *-t- and *-d- are plausible,
but the external parallels suggest rather a pre-Cpt. etymon *m)/°d'r (less likely than,
e.g., *m]$t'r). The retention of "nal -r indicates a lost third syllable and/or late bor
rowing in a period by that the erosion of old Eg. *-r# had completed, but by that
the shift of NK -d- > pre-Cpt. -t- vs. LP *-°- (from NK *-)-) > (SB) -a- had not.
! As suggested by A. Ember (quoted in Spg. KHW; Wst. KHW 105; DELC 125), it may be related to Sem. *midr- “terriccio” [Frz. 1969] = “loam” [Frz. 1975, 48]: PBHbr. meder “Erde, Lehm” [Dalman 1922, 225] = “ordure, a material used for vessels” [ Jastrow 1950, 735] = “argilla” [Frz.] = “clod of earth” [Lsl.], JAram. m2d3r “Erdscholle, weiche Erde, lutum” [Levy 1924 III 32], Syr. medr3 “zolla” [Frz.] = “clod, soil” [Lsl.] ! OSA (Sab.) mdr “territory, ground” [SD 83] = “1. earth, soil, 2. (rural) districts” [Biella 1984, 267] = “land” [Lsl. 1969] = “territory, ground” [Lsl. 1987], Ar. madar- “zolle di argilla” [Frz.] = “boue sèche et tenace, sans sable” [BK II 1078] = “Erdschollen, Lehm(klumpen)” [Wehr 1952, 800] = “aussi: (motte d’)argile” [Vcl.] = “clods of earth, mud” [Lsl.], fem. madar-at- “motte de boue, d’argile, avec laquelle on construit des maisons” [BK] = “fango” [Prd.], hence (as denom. verb) Ar. madara “enduire de boue, d’argile (le sol, l’abreuvoir)” [BK] !! MSA: Mehri mdêr “Lehmziegel” [ Jahn 1902, 210a quoted by Ember apud KHW, not in Jns. 1987] = med1r “sun-dried brick” [Lsl.] = mder (sic) “brique” [Vcl.] !! Geez medr “terra, campo” [Frz.] = medr “Land, Erde” [Lsl. 1969] = m2d2r “country” [Apl.] = m/dr “terre” [Vcl.] = m2dr “1. earth, ground, bottom (of a pit), soil, 2. "eld, country, land, territory, district, region” [Lsl. 1987], Amh. mader “Erde” [Rn. 1873, 10, fn. 1] = m2d2r “earth” [Apl.], Tigre & Amh. & Grg. m2d2r “soil, earth” [Lsl.] (Sem.: Frz. 1969, 308, #6.05; Lsl. 1969, 20; 1987, 330; Bnd. 1970, 34; Apl. 1977, 37/79). The "nal Cpt. -r suggests that the LEg./Cpt. word was borrowed from a certain (Aram.?) re#ex of the Sem. word.
nb1: Whether there is an Akk. parallel is dubious. Several authors, e.g., P. Fronzaroli
(l.c.), W. von Soden (AHW 651), W. Leslau (1969, 20), and D. Appleyard (1977,
37/79), have combined the Geez (etc.) re#ex(es) with the “enigmatic” (Zadok) OAkk.
midrum “eine Art Land (sorta di terra)” (but CAD m2, 48: mng. uncertain). R.
Zadok (1991, 117, §26), in addition, compared also Emar Akk. ma-da-ri-ia “"eld”
and even Akk. (OB, SB) mad3ru II “(mng. uncert.)” [CAD m1, 11b].
nb2: W. Vycichl (DELC 125) supposed that the Eg.-Sem. parallel represents perhaps
an m- pre"x nomen instr. (!), but he failed in presenting any evidence. This is certainly
excluded, the PSem. *C1iC2C3– pattern being typical of triconsonantal roots. M.
Jastrow (1950, 735) erroneously traced back the Can. word (via met.) to *)mrd,
comparing JAram. mird3 “ordure, a material for vessels”.
nb3: For the semantic dispersion in Eg. and Sem., cf., e.g., Gmc. *leima- (m) “Leim,
Kalk (LEW: eig. Klebstoff aus einer Erdmasse, Kluge: die Wurzel bezeichnet offen
bar zunächst einen Stoff zum Verschmieren von Wänden o.ä.)” ~ Lat. l1vis “glatt,
blank, schlüpfrig, #ießend” ~ Gk. 4!J97 “glatt”, eventually akin to Gmc. *lai-ma/.n

IE *lei- “schleimig, davon: 1. durch Näße glitschiger Boden, ausgleiten, worüber

(LEW I 789, 804–5; IEW 662–4; Kluge 1999, 510, 513).
nb4: The AA background of the Sem. term is obscure. L. Reinisch (1873, 10, fn. 1)
erroneously compared the Amh. re#ex with an odd (probably false) SBrb.: Wlmd.
ta-medur-t “Landschaft” (not listed in PAM 2003; K.-G. Prasse, p.c., 10 April 2007:
ta-medur-t “is unknown to me in Tuareg”) as well as NBrb.: Mzg. a-ma*al “earth”. Also
M. Cohen (1947, 191, §477) combined Sem. *mdr with Tuareg (sic, act. Hgr.) -
ma*al “terre”. The latter forms re#ect common Brb. *)m-*-l “earth” [GT], which
is, however, certainly unrelated to Sem. *midr-. U. Paradisi (1960, 160), in turn,
compared the Ar. re#ex with EBrb.: Audjila te-med3â-t ~ te-me*3â-t “1. argilla,
2. anche: terra rossa”, but Brb. -3- + Ar. GT: similarly, the connection of Sem.
*midr- with NBrb.: Mzg. ta-m*ir-t, pl. ti-m*ir-in “parcelle de terrain délimitée par
des sillons qu’on doit labourer en une journée” [Tf. 1991, 406] seems also unlikely
(Brb. *-*- + Sem. *-d-). GT: Sem. *midr- may be eventually akin to LECu.: Baiso
mad3r- “to build” [HL 1988, 126] = “bauen” [Lmb.] !!! NOm.: Sns. m3ddirà “1.

nb6: The etymology of NBrb.: Mzg. )m-d: mad “être de quantité égale, avoir la
même contenance, la même capacité” [Tf. 1991, 402] is uncertain. M. Kossmann
(kind p.c., 17 April 2007) assumes it cold be an m- derivation (not unexpected with
these semantics) of a verb ad, which could be derived from something like *abed
or *ebed.
nb7: Similarly obscure is ECh.: Mkl. míi*ò [-*- < ?] (f ) “mesure (avec une calebasse,
une tasse, par ex.)” [ Jng. 1990, 139].

nb: It occurs “oft ohne m (zumeist nach vorangehender Präposition m)” (presumably due
to haplography), but only “seit D.18 auch vereinzelt in anderen Fällen” (Wb l.c.), which
testi"es to that m- was part of the original root (*m3 or sim.).
! Etymology disputable. Most likely seems #3. " 1. H. Grapow (1914, 4): perhaps an m- pre"x form deriving from a weak root. Later, Grapow (1950, 73) modi"ed this hypothesis of the analysis of m- as a pre"x here and only spoke of a “mobile” min m3.t ~ 3.t (unlikely, see above), leaving the etymology unsolved. B. Koura (1999, 127), although she saw “keine deutliche Ableitung” (on Eg. grounds) either, rendered it in the light of its usual context (where it occurs in connection with 3.t) as a fossilized compound of the Eg. prep. m + 3.t “Leib” (Wb V 503) resulting in a basic sense “(etwas, das) aus dem Gottesleib (herauskommt)” or “(das, was) im Leib (sich be"ndet bzw. sich befand)”. Very weak. " 2. H. Brugsch (Wb II 732) af"liated it with Eg. mdd “auspressen”, which in principle might only be possible on a bicons. basis (cf. Hodge’s suggestion below), but this hardly "ts semantically (as noted by E. Chassinat 1930, 118: “le procédé de fabrication prescrit dans notre formule . . . n’opérait pas par pressurage”).

" 3. E. Chassinat (1930, 118-119 & fn. 2), in turn, suggested that it was probably a m«- (!) pre"x form of 3d3 “être gras” signifying originally
“ce qui sert à graisser” or “celui qui est graisseux”. Absurd. " 4. C.T. Hodge (1966, 45) equated it with WCh.: Hausa máácà (-ts-) “1. to squeeze out ( juice from the lime-fruit), extract (oil from the ground-nuts), 2. press together, 3. massage, eke out (food)”, mácà “to pinch together, squeeze together” [Abr. 1962, 666]. Cf. also ECh.: WDng. mí*yò (m) “pâte pressée pour faire l’huile” < mí*yé “presser” [Fédry 1971, 131]. Such an etymology would hardly "t a term connected with animal grease.
nb: For the AA background of the Ch. root cf. Eg. m3d (below).

nb1: GT: the NOm. root may be akin to SBrb.: EWlm. & Ayr 2-m2* “1. être

AA *m-9 too.

m&.t (usually in pl. m&.wt) “Art Klammer oder Fessel (für das Vieh)” (PT 2202, Wb II 184, 15) = “(semle être) un instrument qu’on pique en terre et qui servait à attacher les bestiaux dans les champs” (Lacau 1913, 81) = “hobble for cattle (made of cord with a wooden cross-bar to be hidden below the earth)” (Grd. 1927, 508–9, V19 & n. 1 pace Montet) = “les arceaux plantés en terre par une corde nouée autour de la lèvre inférieure, qui est juste assez longue pour permettre au captif de se lever sur ses quatre pieds (les arceaux étaient plantés à l’intérieur d’un espace clos)” (Montet 1954, 45–46 & fn. 3) = “fetter” (Gdk. 1955, 33) = “bonds” (FD 123; AECT I 64, spell 67, n. 30: CT I 289) = “Fesselklammern, Strickösen (für Vieh im Boden)” (GHWb 380; ÄWb I 579).
nb: The word is preserved by the hrgl. V19 depicting the same object that was
coloured in Dyn. 0/I black (Kahl 1997, 54, V20). L. Keimer (1949–50, 97)
demonstrated that the hobble signi"ed by Eg. m3.t may have been used the same way
as (probably) the same implement still in use today in Nubia: the hobble consists of a
palm "bre cord and a large loop held by two big stones (cf. also Vcl. 1987, 120, §4).
! Later this meaning was extended pars pro toto: m3.t “1. Viehhof, Stall " 2. Vieh, Herde” (OK, Wb II 185, 1–4) = “cow-house” (AEO I

Its origin has been very much disputed. Most likely seems #5 (and perhaps also #7). " 1. E. Zyhlarz (1934, 111) saw in Eg. m3.wt a cognate of SBrb.: Hgr. ta-mdí-t “grosse pierre (pièce de bois, bottillon d’herbages) à laquelle est attaché une corde (ou une chaîne), enfoncée, ou destinée à l’être, sous terre près de la surface du sol, l’extrémité de la corde restant hors du sol et pouvant servir à attacher un animal (cheval, âne, vache etc.)” < e-mdi “enfoncer sous terre près de la surface du sol” [Fcd. 1951–2, 1161] = “Viehkoppel” [Zhl. 1934] = “P#ock” [Zhl. 1936], Ayr te-md2y-t, pl. ti-m2dday & EWlm. ta-ndi-t, pl. ši-n2dday “pièce de bois, corde, chaîne, pierre dont une partie est enfoncé sous terre, l’autre extrémité sortant du sol et servant à attacher un animal” [PAM 1998, 209; 2003, 523, 588], Tadghaq & Tudalt 2-md2y “to tie (animal to stick)” [Sudlow 2001, 133]. However attractive it may be from a semantical viewpoint, this Eg.-SBrb. parallel can be by no means valid as SBrb. -d vs. Eg. -3 do not correspond.
nb: Later, Zyhlarz (1936, 442) compared the Hgr. word to a certain Eg. m’dy (sic)
“feststecken” (sic).
" 2. H. Goedicke (1955, 33) and E. E. Knudsen (1962, 35, §7) assumed in Eg. m3.t “bond” vs. m03 “fessel” a case of the supposed interchange of Eg. 0 ~ 3. But the uses of these words are different. In addition, a common origin is improbable in the light of convincing cognates to Eg. m03 con"rming -3 (not GW) < *-r. " 3. C. T. Hodge (1966, 45, #34) identi"ed Eg. m3.wt “bonds with WCh.: Hausa máácè (-ts-) “to "rmly wind on (turban)” [Abr. 1962, 668]. Phonologically possible (Hausa -c- < AA *-ç- ~ Eg. -3–). But cf.

Behrens (1984–85, 190, §4.27; quoted also apud Vcl. 1987, 120–1) erroneously derived Eg. m3.t “Viehhof, Stall” from the basic sense *“Dorngehege” or “umzäunter Platz zum Schutz der Tiere während der Nacht” and equated it with NOm.: Gimirra m3g “siepe” [CR 1925, 621] = mag “fence” [Bnd.] !

" 5. W.

Cf. esp. Om. *m$g- “to dig, bury” [GT] (discussed s.v. Eg. m3 “deep”). " 6. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 182; HSED #1809), ignoring its original sense, combined Eg. m3.t (coll.) “stalled cattle” (!) with ECh.: Birgit (sic) muuzo “ox”. Perfectly incorrect. Rejected already by G.

! This Eg. numeral has always been a challange for Eg./AA linguistics. One of the most dif"cult words from the viewpoint of etymology. There have been offered several etymologies, but until very recently a fully satisfactory solution has not been found. The etymologies described under #1/2/5/6/7 are out of question for phonological or/and semantical considerations. Some other etymologies also have considerable drawbacks enough to have to be careful about them. #3 may not be fully excluded, while #4/8/9/10 are perhaps possible. However, the solution outlined in #11 seems to be most probable both phonologically and semantically. " 1. A. Trombetti (1902, 198), C. Brockelmann (1908, 487), W. Worrell (1926, 272), and G.A. Barton (1934, 30) erroneously equated LEg. md, Dem. mt, and Cpt. (S etc.) mht with Sem. *mi"-át- “hundred”
[Dlg.] (ignoring OEg. m3 and the fact that the Sem. fem. marker *-atwas not part of the root). This phonologically fully irreal suggestion has rightly been declined already by W. F. Albright (1918, 92, fn. 6), later also by F. A. Dombrowski and B. W. W. Dombrowski (1991, 342), and by V. Bla&ek (1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10). " 2. There has been a long tradition of mistakenly comparing Eg. m3 with the re#exes of PBrb. *mÄraw “10” [Zhl. 1934–35, 185] = *mar3w [Prs. 1974, 403, 405] = *mra (m), *mra-ut (f ) [Zvd. 1975, 50–51, §14.0] = *märäw (sic) [Vernus] = *maraw [Mlt., GT]. Correctly rejected by W. Vycichl (1983, 124), followed by G. Takács (1995 MS, 4, #7; 1996, 139, #35; 1996, 442, #2.3), as there is no evidence for Eg. -3 ~ Brb. *-r-, while Brb. *-w is part of the root (contrary to Eg. masc. m3.w vs. fem. m3.t).

nb3: The various authors eleborated diverse (false) theories for justifying the com
parison of Eg. m3 and Brb. *maraw “10”, e.g.: (1) E. Zyhlarz (1931, 138, #8),
uncritically followed by D.J. Wölfel (1954, 58), analyzed Brb. *mer-aw as composed of
an original root *)m-r + pl. ending *-aw, whereby he equated PBrb. *)m-r directly
with Eg. m3. But the Lautentsprechung of Eg. 3 = Brb. *r (sic) suggested by Zyhlarz
never existed. (2) Alternatively, Wölfel (l.c.) argued that alternation of Brb. d ~ r
was “not unusual” (sic). I.e., he assumed a false correspondence of Eg. -3 ~ Brb.
**-d- > *-r-. (3) O. Rössler (1966, 227; 1971, 317), in turn, traced back Eg. m3 to
an earlier *m33.w/*m3æ.w (in Rössler’s transcription), which he equated with the
Brb. root reconstructed by him as *)m-r-" (not considering the "nal *-w as part of
the root). Thus, he maintained in fact a correspondence of Eg. -3 ~ Brb. *-" that
is not justi"ed by any etymological evidence. (4) Ju.N. Zavadovskij (1974, 104, 112;
1975, 44, 50–51) also supported the reconstruction of Eg. *m33 < *mrg that he
regarded as a match of Brb. *)m-r-w, although Eg. -3 [< *-g] is incompatible with
Brb. *-w. Zavadovskij (1975, 50–51, §14.0) eventually derived the Brb.-Eg. root from
AA *)m- (!) comparing also Hausa goma “10” (below) and Cu. *tama (sic) “10”.
Absurd. (5) Strangely, A. Loprieno (1986, 1309, 1316, n. 32) developed similar
ideas considering Eg. m3 and Brb. *märaw (sic) “eventuell” both related to Bed.
tamin “10” and HECu.: Hdy. tomo “10” (!) “durch Metathese” (!). In addition, at the
same time (!), he assumed even an ultimate connection with Eg. m3 “tief ” (below).
(6) V. Bla&ek (1987 MS, 40–41; 1989, 215–216; 1990, 41; 1997, 18) has postulated
(pace Rössler) a development of Eg. m3 < *m33 < *mrg, which he identi"ed with
the PBrb. root that he preferred to reconstruct as *mar3gw > *maraw with regard
to two isolated derivatives (WBrb.: Zenaga mereg and Guanche: Tenerife marago
“10”, see above). Although this argumentation seems fairly attractive, only the shift
of Brb. *-ww- > -gg- is attested and not vice versa (Prs. 1972, 64). According to
the Brb. comparative-historical phonology elaborated recently (Mlt. 1991, 244–246),
Zenaga -g and Tenerife -g- represent a secondary development from *-w, and not
traces of PBrb. *-gw (con"rmed for me by A.Ju. Militarev, p.c., Moscow, September
1995). Besides, K.-G. Prasse (1974, 403, 405) and A.Ju. Militarev (1991, 166) have
both reconstruct the PBrb. -C3 as *-w. Thus, the Zenaga-Guanche can only re#ect
PBrb. *mar3/aw and not *maragw. The coincidence with Ar. maCr- “5. grande
quantité, 6. armée nombreuse” [BK II 1064] = “much, many, numerous” [Ehret]
!!! NOm.: Male m!rge “many” [Sbr. 1994–95, 9] may be due to chance. Besides, the
Ar. root was connected by Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 196, #1771) with ECu. *-mig- “to
be full” (below). (7) Following O. Rössler’s hypothesis on identifying Eg. *m33 with
PBrb. *)m-r-", V. Bla&ek (1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10) has later alternatively
assumed a development *)m-r-" < *)m-r-« in Brb., cf. the occasional re#ection of
Sem. *« by Eg. 3 (EDE I 261–2).

" 3. K. Sethe (1916, 17) and A. Loprieno (1986, 1309) supposed the eventual relationship of Eg. m3 “10” with m3 “deep” (see below), which they failed to demonstrate with typological parallels for the odd semantic shift (which, naturally, cannot be ruled out completely). V. Bla&ek (1997, 17; 1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10) excluded a direct connection between the two Eg. words. " 4. F. Behnk (1928, 139, #33) suggested that Eg. m3 [< *mg] might represent a met. of the AA word attested in WCh.: Hausa góómà “10” [Brg. 1934, 397; Abr. 1962, 332] = góómàà [ JI]. I.e., should we presume Eg. *m†3.'w < (via met.) *3†m.'w < pre-OEg. *g†m.'w? Note that roots with the sequence 3m- were not typical in Eg. This quite realistic etymological approach to the Eg. word was regarded as possible also by V. Bla&ek (1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10). The Eg.-Hausa/Ch. comparison was repeated by Ju.N.

*-kumi “10”, which would exclude its equation with Eg. m3. However, a genuine AA
etymology of PCh. *gw-m is also possible, cf. AA *g-m “complete (or sim.)” [GT]
(discussed under #11 below). V. Bla&ek (1987, 41), in turn, combined the PCh.-Eg.
parallel with SBrb.: Ahaggar a-gyim (-D- apud Fcd.) “millier” [Fcd. 1951–2, 444],
Ghat a-‰im (a-djim apud Nehlil) [-‰- < *-gy-] “mille” [Nhl. 1909, 179].
" 5. Ju.N. Zavadovskij (1974, 112; 1975, 44) and A. Loprieno (1986, 1316, n. 32) have supposed that Eg. m3 could be a met. of Cu. *)t-m-n “10”. Fully irreal. Eg. -3 has nothing to do with Cu. *t-, not to mention the additional Cu. *-n, which is not re#ected in Eg. " 6. I. M.

Loprieno (1986, 1309, 1316, n. 33) suspected the ultimate common origin of Eg. m3 “10” and m3 “deep” with such Sem. roots as *m)) “aufsaugen” (!), *mdd (!) “lang ziehen, ausdehnen”, *m99 (!) “lang ziehen, ausdehnen”. Fully unacceptable. None of the Sem. roots can correspond to Eg. m3. The comparison with Sem. *m)) is to be excluded on semantical grounds (how should one "gure a relationship of “aufsaugen” vs. “ten”?), while that with Sem. *mdd and *m99 for phonological reasons (Eg. 3 & Sem. *d or *9). Rightly rejected already by V. Bla&ek (1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10). " 8. V. Bla&ek (1987 MS, 41; 1990, 41) has compared Eg. m3 to CCh.: Higi gr. *mu—- “10” [GT]: Higi m/ng° [Str.] = mw[$—!T [Mrl. 1972, 102] = mù—2y [Brt.-Jng.], Higi-Nkafa mù—2y [Krf.], Higi-Baza m$nge [Lks. 1937, 113] = mù—2 [Krf.], Higi-Kamale mù—$ [Krf.] vs. Kapsiki (= Kamale?) m-ng [Str.] = m2— [WL] = mÜ—(Ö) [Brt.-Jng.], Higi-Ghye mù—2y [Krf.], Higi-Bana mÜ—§ [WL] = mÖ— [Brt.-Jng.], Higi-Futu mù—i [Krf.], Fali-Gili mù— [Krf. 1972 MS] (Higi gr.: Str. 1922–1923, 123; Wente-Lukas 1973, 7; Kraft 1981 II, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 191, #10; Brt.-Jng. 1993, 131), which can be only be valid
provided Eg. *m†3.'w < *m,$n3.'w and if the Higi numeral stems from *mung-. This tempting Eg.-CCh. equation was mentioned also by G. Takács (1994, 217) in the context of further AA parallels (for which see #11 below).
nb1: Interesting to observe that this etymology would be supported also by the
vocalization of Eg. *m†3.aw/*m†3.'t (Edel 1955, 166–176) = *m†3.aw/*m†3.at
(Loprieno 1986, 1309) vs. *mö3 (Vcl. 1983, 124) > MBab. cuneiform mu-9u.
nb2: The etymology of Higi gr. *mu—- “10” is uncertain. Contrary to Bla&ek (l.c.),
D. Ibriszimow (1990, 211–2) excluded a met. from Ch. *gum-/*gwam- “10” (above).
Later, Bla&ek (1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10) derived Higi gr. *mu—- “10”
from *mu-mg-, which might be etymologically identical with Agaw *mang- “many”
[GT] !! LECu. *mang- “many” [GT] !!! NOm.: Shinasha manga “heavy” [Lmb.]
(discussed below, cf. #11). If this is correct, a remote kinship between Higi gr.
*mu—- with Eg. m3 is not impossible. Cf. also Takács 1995, 5–6; 1996, 140, #35;
1996, 443, #7 (Eg.-Higi-ECu.-NOm.).
" 9. C. T. Hodge (kind p.c. on 4 September 1994) has not excluded that Eg. m3 “10” is akin to PBrb. *t1-mih*ay, pl. *t5-muh3* “100” [Prasse 1974, 406]. Since PBrb. ** can go back to PAA ** (cf. Mlt. 1991, 242; Takács 2006, 57–59, 62), the phonological correspondence of Eg. 3 ~ PBrb. ** is regular. Hodge’s idea is to be accounted for, although PBrb. *-h- seems to have no match in Eg. m3.

nb2: The AA etymology of the Brb. numeral is obscure. (1) A. Klingenheben (quoted
by Wölfel 1954, 75) and M.G. Mercier (1933, 316) erroneously explained it as a
late borrowing from Ar. mi"-at- (!), which has rightly been excluded by Wölfel (l.c.).
Surprisingly, this absurd equation of the Brb. numeral with Sem. *mi"-at- “1.000”
has been recently suggested also by E. Lipinski (1997, 291, §35.20). (2) On the
other hand, F. Nicolas (1953, 206) combined the Brb. numeral for “100” with the
Brb. root attested in WBrb.: Zng. )m-d “"nir, être "ni”. (3) GT: cf. perhaps ECh.:
Mkl. mèedá (f ) “cent, centaine(s)” [ Jng. 1990, 138], although Mkl. -d- vs. Brb.
*-*- seem also irregular.
" 10. V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 202) identi"ed Eg. m3 with their ECh. *mwa‰- “10” (no re#exes mentioned), which is certainly a false reconstruction.

nb1: In theory, there could be a little chance that Somrai form derives from an earlier

evidence for that Somray mo‰ [Nct.] etc. re#ects *)m-w-d attested by its earlier

nb2: The AA background of the ECh. numeral is disputed. (1) V. Bla&ek (1997, 18;
1999, 251–3, §10; 1999, 47–49, §10) tried to derive it from a hypothetic *mV*V
supposed to correspond phonologically to Eg. m3 and even PBrb. *t1-mih*ay “100”
[Prasse 1974, 406] (above). In principle, Somray -‰ < ECh. *-* < AA *ç/*æ/**
might perhaps be indeed plausible, cf. ECh. *ga*-”cheek” [GT]: Kabalai kwa‰í

HSED #866 vs. #914). But in this case, there is no suf"cient and convincing piece
of evidence for reconstructing *-*- in the ECh. numeral against *-d-. Consequently,
the available records provide hardly any proof for the relatedness of the Eg. and
ECh. numerals. (2) G. Takács (1999, 136; 1999, 202–203, #3.2) connected ECh.
*)m-(w)-d with Sem. *ma”d- “many” [Djk.] !!! PBrb. impf. *ya-mduh, pf. *yu-mdah

“all” [Bnd. 1994, 1158, #1] (discussed in detail s.v. Eg. *mt.t). If this Sem.-Brb.
SOm.-ECh. comparison proves to be valid, the ECh. numeral can have nothing
in common with Eg. m3.

< )mag. C. Conti Rossini (1913, 71) extended this also to NAgaw (Kemant) assuming
a common PCu. *mag > *m-mag > *mamg > Kemant & SA mang-. G. Banti (p.c.,
19 April 2007) sees in the LECu. forms a pre"x ma- (“the form is like mabla ‘seeing’”
in Saho-Afar). D. Appleyard (p.c., 20 April 2007) shares the same view: “mamga
is certainly the more ‘archaic’ in so far as it is more transparently the nominal pre!x ma- + the
verbal root -mg-, i.e. PEC *mig-/mug- etc. ‘be full’ . . . it seems to me quite reasonable to build
a new ‘root’ on the basis of a nominal derivation *ma-m[V]g-; partial reduplication of the
C1VC1VC2– type seems less likely to me”. The Cu. stem was probably borrowed into
Eth.-Sem.: Gafat mängä, Amh. mänga, Gurage-Soddo mänga “herd, #ock” (ES:
Lsl. 1945, 163; 1979 III, 408–9; Apl. 1977, 26/68 with less like alternative Sem.

already by Gardiner (AEO l.c.), “perhaps there was contamination of the two words”.
G. Roquet (1973, 162, fn. 1), in turn, distinguished in (S) μto the contaminated
re#exes of two diverse etyma, namely (1) that meaning “profondeur” < Eg. m3.(w)t
vs. (2) that signifying “#ot” < Eg. mtr.t, their coincidence being due to “l’hybridation”
of (S) μtw vs. μto.

Zibelius 1972, 134–7. As formulated by I. Hofmann (1969, 1119), it was “kein
kleiner Gebietskomplex, sondern größere Regionen mit mehreren Hauptlingstümern”. In the MK
(probably by the time of the Ächtungstexte), the land name m33 disappeared as a
historic reality and “ceased to be an exactly de!ned geographic entity” (Grd.) as the old m33j
population was ousted by a new race, though the m33j still existed as a separate
clan/tribe (AEO I 78*–79*; Zibelius 1972, 136).
nb2: In C. Peust’s view (1999 Nap., 213 & fn. 88), the “Landesname m33 ist schlecht bezeugt”,
since “die meisten, vielleicht alle in den Belegstellen angegebenen Beispiele könnte man auch als plu
ralische Volksbezeichnung M33.w lesen”, which has not been maintained by other authors.
nb3: This toponym may have survived in the “LEth.” (à la Wb) inscriptions of
the Napatan and Meroitic kings as mdd(t) ~ mdj(t) (as suggested in Schäfer 1901,
41f.; AEO I 81*; Hofmann 1969, 1121–2; Zibelius 1971, 133–7), although even
the identity of mdj (Nastasen) with mdd (Harsiotef ) has been debated by K. Sethe
(1916, 129: “hat . . . nichst damit . . . zu tun”). A. H. Gardiner (AEO I 81*) regarded both
mdj and mdd as “doubtless identical”, although he maintained that these have “hardly
anything to do with the Medjay”. Paradoxically, he, nevertheless, admitted that Schäfer’s
hypothesis on the relationship of the m33j and the Beja “is advanced by the mention
of M33j (sic)” in the inscriptions of the “Ethiopian” kings, i.e., the attestation of
Napatan mdj ~ mdd. Although C. Peust (1999 Nap., 213–4) was disposed to equate
Napatan mdd vs. mdj and disconnect both from GR mtj ~ mdj “Mede” (as “his
torisch kaum plausibel” contra AEO I 81*), he doubted their etymological connection

after Dyn. XVIII”. K. Zibelius (1972, 136–7) also denied the survival of m33j after
Dyn. XX claiming that this term “im Koptischen ist überhaupt nicht belegt”. So also Peust
(1999 Nap., 214): “das neuägyptische m33 ‘Polizist’ im späteren Ägyptischen nicht fortlebt”.
One may indeed agree with C. Peust (1999 Nap., 213) in that depalatalization -3– >
-d- presumably did not occur in m33j, since its C2 was constantly written as -3– until
the late NK and also in the Ptol. texts. Most of the authors (e.g., Grif"th 1909 III,
m!3

319; Sethe 1916, 124–131; 1923, 169; Spg. KHW 66; Kees 1930, 346–7; AEO I
81*; Hofmann 1969, 1121, fn. 65; Zibelius 1972, 137, fn. 122; CED 93; KHW 105;
Smith 1978, 360–1; DELC 125; Peust 1999 Nap., 213–4; Quack 2005, 314) have
derived the Cpt. term from Dem. mtj “Medien, auch: Meder” (DG 185:2) = “1.
Meder, genauer: Perser, 2. (!) Soldat” (Peust). Although W. Vycichl (DELC 125) also
accepted the derivation from GR mdj “Mede”, he has still assumed (SB) matoi <
*matáj, pl. *mató3j (sic, *-3j, pace Lacau). As a compromise, some authors surmised
that Cpt. (SB) matoi etc. “ist aus den lautlich zusammengefallenen Begriffen mdj ‘Meder’ und
m33j ‘m33j-Nubier’ entstanden” (Kaplony, LÄ V 271, n. 15 pace DG 195; Hodge 1969,
11–12; KHW 105; DELC 125), i.e., via contamination of both lexemes, cf. Dem.
m3w ~ m3j ~ mtj “Soldat, auch: Polizist (später mit mtj ‘Meder’ zusammengefallen)”
(DG 195:1). J. ,erný’s (CED 93) allegation that Wb II 86, 4 “confuses mdy with the
African people m33y!” is somewhat misleading, since the relevant Belegstellen have
evidently m33j. Moreover, the authors of Wb (l.c.) have clearly denied the connec
tion of the Cpt. word with Eg. m33j: “vermutlich nicht das Kopt. matoi” (Vrg. 1950,
294: “sans doute à bon droit”). H. Satzinger (kind p.c., 14 April 2007), however, still
holds the opposite view: “It is clear to me that Coptic matoi goes back to this [i.e., LEg.
m33j], notwithstanding any late allusions to, or pun with, the Medes”.
nb2: T. Säve-Söderbergh (1941, 138f.) and M. Bietak (1966, 61–78; LÄ IV 999,
1003), followed by I. Hofmann (1969, 1127), J. Vercoutter (1970, 164), K. Zibelius
(1972, 135–6), and A. Eggebrecht (1974, 175, fn. 104) identi"ed the m33j with the
population of the pangrave-culture (Pfannengräberkultur, spread between Middle
Egypt and the 2nd cataract, late MK and 2nd IMP) as well as the beginning of the
tradition of the m33j serving in Egypt (end of Dyn. XIII) with the expansion of
the pangrave-culture. In the NK, there is hardly any proof for that the m33j “police
troops comprised men of Nubian stock”, while their of"cers were presumably Egyptians
(AEO I 83*-84*; Zibelius 1972, 136 & fn. 120 with lit.).
! Although the Eg. term has an abundant literature, its ultimate origin is still little known. This debate cannot be discussed here in full details. This entry has predominantly to be restricted to presenting the etymological aspect of the question. So far, no satisfactory etymology has been proposed. " 1. Following H. Schäfer, several egyptologists have identi"ed Eg. m33 with the name of the Beja tribes attested as Bed. be*aûye ~ be‰aûye “1. (m) Bedschavolk, 2. (f ) die Bedauyesprache” [Rn. 1895, 44] = be*awi ~ bi*awi “low-born”, hence be*áwi! ~ bi*áwi! “the language of the Hadendiwa and kindred tribes” [Rpr. 1928, 160] = t$-be*3wiy1 (with fem. art.) “Bedauyesprache” [Zhl.] = be*ãwie ~ be‰ãwie “Bedja” (m) vs. t$-be*awñye (f ) “Sprache der Bedja” [Behrens after Almkvist] = $-be*áuye “the Beja”, 3-be*áuye “the Bejas” [Zbr.]. E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 168) analyzed the name as *bi*a (Hadendowa) “Nomaden” + an ancient Formativelement *-3wi. P. Behrens (1981, 31) also isolated the element *be*a that “als ehemeliges Ethnonym der Bedja-Stämme anzusehen (ist)”. A. Zaborski (1989, 176, n. 5) found the pure stem *bi*a in bi*a-y gau “nomad’s hut” (gau “hut”, -y gen. ending). A.H. Gardiner (AEO I 81*) was disposed to accept Schäfer’s etymology assuming that it “might still be true if we suppose the
m!3 811



812
descendants of the Medjay were gradually pushed back from the Ba%n el-(agar southwards and eastwards towards the Red Sea, but it is not provable”. This etymology, which has a number of dif"culties, has been rejected by W. M. Müller (quoted in AEO I 80*), von Bissing (RT 34, 127), and L. P. Kirwan (1937, 75). C. Peust (1999, 214) has remained neutral: “ob diese Beja . . . mit den ägyptischen M33.w und/oder den napatanischen Mdy gleichzusetzen sind, lässt sich kaum sicher entscheiden”. But neither of the authors managed either to convincingly demonstrate the identity of OK m33 and the etymon of Bed. *bi*a or even to realize and address the most fundamental and most disturbing phonological hindrance, whereby we may probably de"nitely rightly discard this Eg.-Bed. comparison, namely that why b- shifted to m- in OEg. and how OK -3 could re#ect Bed. -Ø. Secondly, several authors assumed for Bed. *bi*a an old etymon with *-g- (below) but failed to explain how *biga (or sim.) became m33 in OEg., i.e., how *-g- was palatalized during the borrowing (as noted already by A. H. Gardiner, AEO I 81*: the -g- “makes a connection with Eg. m33 very dif!cult”).

108, 133, 137; Herzog in LÄ I 676–7 & n. 2 (Bedja/Bega, sic!); Grzymski 1982,
27–29. Besides, the rather poor lexicon entry by R. Herzog (l.c.) is to be treated
with caution, where, a.o., Beja is treated as “Sammelbezeichnung für . . . Stämme . . ., deren
Sprache zum Ostkuschitischen (sic!) . . . gehört”.
nb1: I. Hofmann (1969, 1127) maintained that “das Gebiet vom Ostufer des Nil bis
zum Roten Meer war von altersher von einer nomadischen Bevölkerung besiedelt, der die Pfan
nengräber-Kultur zugeordnet werden muß . . . Die M33j . . . sind wahrscheinlich mit diesen Pfan
nengräber-Leuten identisch. Die heutigen Beja-Völker gehören dem gleichen Kulturbereich an.”
But eventually, Hofmann hesitated to derive the name Beja from Eg. m33 (instead,
she saw its ancestor rather in bwgm occuring in the late Eg. sources, below).
P. Behrens (1981, esp. 24, 27, 33), in turn, tried to establish the relative chronology
of the supposed subsequent settlement of the Nubian and the Beja (identi"ed with
the Blemmyes, the brhm of the late Eg. sources in the second half of the 1st mill.
BC) tribes merely on the basis of a couple of lexical isoglosses, whereby he “takes
for granted” (Zbr.) “daß das Niltal nicht Urheimat der Bedja sein kann” and “daß die Bedja
erst nach den Nubiern das Niltal erreichten”, i.e., that the “Belhe . . . seine Bewohner – wohl
ein Unterstamm der Bedja – im Zuge schwindender pharaonischer Macht kurz vor Ende des Neuen
Reichesschubweise ins obere Niltal verstoßen”, whence he concluded to that “man geht wohl
nicht fehl, als Zeitpunkt des spätestmöglichen Erscheinens der Bedja im Niltal die Zeitwende
anzusehen”. This hypothesis has been fully rejected by A. Zaborski (1989, 169–170,
174–5), who doubts “whether M33w are to be identi!ed simply with Beja. In my opinion
– so Zaborski – such a possibility to identify them exists indeed though it is quite possible that
the name M33w was used not only for the Beja, i.e. not only for one and the same people. It
could have a broader and a not very precise meaning like ‘Ethiopians’, ‘Nubians’ and even ‘Beja’
m!3



813
in the Middle Ages”. In the light of the “quite attractive” hypothesis about the location
of the AA Urheimat in the Sudanese aj-Djazira or in Ethiopia, Zabosrki holds the
view that “there should be no need to consider the Beja as relatively late newcomers but as true
natives of the Red Sea Hinterlandsince very prehistoric times”. He tentatively accepted the
identity of Beja vs. M33 assuming “that political factors were crucial also in the process
of the introduction of the . . . name Blemmyes . . . when Egypt became gradually weak . . . and the
Blemmyan chieftains became strong . . . so that the old name M33w/M33yw especially with its
secondary meanings ‘hunters’, ‘policemen’ . . . was no more adequate . . .”.
nb2: The etymology of the name Beja (Be*awye) is very much disputed. No convinc
ing suggestion has been put forward. Some of the various re#exes of this ethnonym
in ancient sources are also uncertain.
(1) Its traditional derivation from Ar. badwiyy- ~ bad3wiyy- “nomade, bédouin,
habitant du désert” < badw- “désert où vivent des peuples nomades” [BK I 99–100]
(mentioned, e.g., in AEO I 81*; Vcl. 1958, 183) should be excluded (as there is no
correspondence between Ar. -d- and Bed. -*-). Note that I. Wajnberg (1935, 63)
erroneously explained Geez b3d3 “desertum” [Dillmann] and Tna. b3d. “deserto”
[Bassano] from the contraction of a hypothetic *b3«ed. or *ba + *"a%ad$.
Recently, it has been a common view that the name of the Beja originally contained
*-g- (and not *-*-) re#ected by a number of Nubian ethno-/toponyms of the type
*Bega/*Buga explained by A. Zaborski (1989, 173) as a re#ex “actually going back to
Beja which, in its turn, has the stem Be*a with a retro"ex /*/ as its source”, although there
is no evidence in each case for the common origin of all these names:
(2) E. Zyhlarz (1958, 14 & n. 18) tried to prove its presence as the 1st component
of the Eg. TN bgšgj (around the 4th and 5th cataract) occuring in a list of countries
in Kush (Thotmes III), which he interpreted as *bg “Beja” + Mer. Ta3i (sic) “small”,
lit. “small Bega (?)” (located in the Bayuda steppe). Rather dubious. K. Zibelius
(1972, 113) received Zyhlarz’s suggestion with right reservation and she was rather
inclined to emend the rdg. of the TN as gbšg.
(3) I. Hofmann (1969, 1124–7) maintained that the Beja were identical with the
enigmatic people bwgm ~ bwkm (in the Eastern Desert) of the Eg. religious sources
from the LP (she combined its suf"x -m with Bed. -b “dir. Objektssuf"x”).
(4) A number of authors, a.o., A. H. Gardiner (AEO I 81*), W. Vycichl (l.c.),
F. Hintze (1967, 79), P. Behrens (1981, 30–31, §4.1.2–3), C. Peust (1999, 214)
traced the name Beja in the inscriptions of king Ezana, ruler of the Axum Empire
(around 350 AD), where he is named a.o. as king of the Bega or Buga (Geez var.)
vs. O9#3)!&%6" (Gk. var. in gen.pl.), in which “möchte man die Vorfahren der Bedja sehen”
(Behrens). Gardiner (AEO l.c.) referred also to an inscription from Adulis (south of
Massawa), where q!35 is attested, rightly noting that “the -3- makes a connection with
Eg. m33 very dif!cult”.
(5) L. P. Kirwan (1937, 70) found the ethnonym Bega (B!35) in the work on Chris
tian topography by Kosmas Indikopleustes mentioning this as the name given by
the Ethiopians for the Blemmyes (a people settled between Egypt and Ethiopia),
whence P. Behrens (1981, 31) has quite convincingly stated that “somit dürfte an der
Identität Bega = Blemyer kaum noch ein Zweifel bestehen”. The relation of the two names
is obscure. A. Zaborski (1989, 173): “Whether there is any etymological connection between
Blhm.we and Beja/Bega is quite improbable. That this different usage could re"ect dialect
differences is possible”.
(6) W. Vycichl (1958, 183) correctly stated the identity of Beja with Ar. buC3
(Al-W3qd5, 790 AD) ~ beC3 (Ibn Hawqal, 988 and Maqr5z5, ca. 1400), whose -C
H. Almkvist (1885, 10) regarded as “fehlerhafte Aussprache” of the retro#ex Bed. -*- “seitens
der Araber”. Following him, P. Behrens (1981, 31) saw “eine gewisse Wahrscheinlichkeit,
daß Bex3 (Bux3) und Bega (Buga) Aussprachevarianten des Stammesbezeichnung Be*a (Buda?)
darstellen”. He also assumed that the Bed. retro#ex -*- was “von Sprechern des Arabischen
entweder als x . . . artikuliert . . . oder als g in Bega – so der Name eines Dorfes, das von Bedja bewohnt
m!3



814
wird, und gleichzeitig eine Bezeichnung für die Bedja selbst”. I. Hofmann (1969, 1125, fn.
103), in turn, postulated a reverse way of derivation, i.e., that in this case Bed. -*-,
which she de"ned as postvelar or supra-dental (Almkvist: präkakuminal), represents
in fact a borrowed Ar. -C-, cf. Ar. «aC5n- “1 pétri (farine, pâte, etc.), 2. pâte” [BK II
185] borrowed into Bed. "a*5n “Teig” [Rn. 1895, 8]. In Hofmann’s view, the old
name *bega became in Ar. *beCa-wiya, which, in turn, was re-borrowed into Bed.
as be*awiye. Zaborski (1989, 175) “it is possible that . . . the traditional names of the Beja
people are genuine and not of foreign origin”.
(7) In addition, Hofmann (l.c.) surmised that “möglicherweise hängt auch der Name der
Nilinsel Bigge (die im Nubischen Bijje ausgesprochen wird) mit dem Volk Bigga (sic, -gg-!)
zusammen”.
(8) K. Grzymski (1982, 27–29) assumed an etymological connection with Meroitic
medewi ~ bedewi “Meroe (D!('B)” [Peust] = bedewe ~ mdewe, act. /*berdowi ~
*mberdowi/ [Zibelius] (the name was identi"ed so by F. L. Grif"th 1917, 169–171;
1929, 70–71 after A. H. Sayce). Grzymski supposed the var. with m- (attested older)
to re#ect a southern dialect, while the var. with b- a northern Mer. dial. He compared
this variation to that of Eg. brw.t (XXV. and later) ~ mrw.t (Ptol., Zibelius 1972,
106–7) > Dem. mrw “das Land Meroe” (DG 169:7) > (?) OCpt. peroue (attested in
an obscure context, cf. Koenig 1987, 109). Ultimately, however, Grzymski hesitated
to maintain the continuity of OK m33 " LEg. md(3) " Mer. medewi ~ bedewi "
Bed. *bi*a, which “seems rather unsubstantiated in the light of” the different wtg. of Eg.
brw.t (LP-GR) vs. m33 (NK). Since “das meroitische <d> wird traditionell als retro"exes
[*] interpretiert”, C. Peust (1999 Nap., 209) supposed quite suggestively that “man
kann . . . als angenäherte Aussprache des Toponyms etwa *[berwe] oder *[be*we] rekonstruieren”,
but he refrained from drawing any further conclusions. Besides, M. F. L. Macadam
(Allen Memorial Art Museum Bulletin 22, 1966, 52) suggested that Begarawiya
[Macadam] = Bag(a)r3w5ya [Peust pace Engelbach], the modern name of the site
of Meroe preserves the ancient name (Mer. -d- being “close” to -r- “or more like” -‰-).
He presumed it to have sounded rather *be‰rawiya (coming from Mer. bedewi),
which Grzymski (1982, 30, n. 16) was inclined to accept with regard to the shift
of m- > b- conceived as a “chronological factor”, but Peust (1999 Nap., 208) correctly
voiced the reservation that the inlaut -g- (written with Class. Ar. -q-) “macht es eher
wenig wahrscheinlich, dass dieser auf das alte Meroe zurückgeht”.
(9) GT: on the other hand, any connection to Gumuz (in Ethiopia): Sai b2ga, Sese
bÖga, Gojjam bag(3), Kokit ba:ha, pl. bÜgá “person” (Gumuz: Bnd. 1979, 63)?
" 2. A. Ember (1911, 93, fn. 4), surprisingly enough, was deceived by the misleading coincidence of NK m33j “policeman” with Akk. ma))artu [< *ma-n)ar-t-] “Bewachung, Wache” [AHW 620], which have naturally nothing in common with one another. Absurd. This hasty etymology was soon rejected by F. Behnk (1927, 80).
nb: The Akk. word derives from Akk. n)r “bewachen, schützen, bewahren” [AHW
755] which is, of course, unrelated to Eg. m33. Note that the underlying Sem.
*n.r stem from a bicons. AA *æ-r “to watch” [GT], cp. WCh. Hausa mácàráá (-ts-)
“place occupied by those on guard”, mácàríí “watchman, watcher, lookout, picquet,
outpost” < cárì ~ cáróó (m) “guarding” [Abr. 1962, 667, 879].
" 3. O. Bates (1914, 42, fn. 15) suggested in a rather unprecise and obscure form, albeit “with great reserve” (no surprise), that “the name of the ‘Mazoi’ Aethiopians” (sic) might be akin to the Hamitic (i.e., in this case, Berber) names (i.e., ethnonyms) stemming from the root *)m-z-3, assuming that “also the Hamitic-Negro (sic) Masai (sic) may be a survival of it”. Absurd.

815
" 4. E. Zyhlarz (1934–1935, 172, 245) connected Eg. m33 with Nub.: Kunuzi, Dongola bo,gi “Freiland, Steppe”. Unconvincing (for the phonological problems cf. above). " 5. C. T. Hodge (1969, 11–12) eventually suggested a native Eg. origin of the name, which he erroneously based on the mistaken assumption that primarily m33 was “actually the name of these mercenaries sent by Egypt to guard her frontiers”. This made him explain Akk. mi/u)ru “Egypt (also: ‘boundary’)” and Hbr. mi)rayim “Egypt” < Sem. *mi)rregarded by him as a back-formation deriving from *mi)ray borrowed (!) from Eg. m33.j, the nisbe of Eg. m33 (which, in his view, merged with the genuine Sem. word for “boundary”!). In addition, Hodge ultimately af"liated Eg. m33.j with Eg. 3r.w “boundary”. Absurd.
nb: Alternatively, he proposed for Eg. m33.j a different (but equally far-fetched) ety
mology: pre"x m- + 33j “to cross over” resulting in *m-33j lit. *”traverser” (Hodge:
“not far from ‘hunter’ ”!) or *“the one who moves about” (Hodge: “specialized to a group
of nomads many of whom took service in Egypt and became a foreign name for Egypt, at least to
the northeast as these soldiers represented their adopted country on that frontier”) on the analogy
of 0abiru “an unsettled people” (< *«br, Hodge: lit. *”one who crosses from place
to place, transient”). He derived also Eg. 33j “boat” and 33j.w “opponent” ~ Akk.
)erru and Hbr. )ar “enemy”. Equally false. Hodge confused diverse roots that are
etymologically unrelated.
" 6. GT: provided (1) some of the Cushitic tribes (including ECu., and the Beja) had inhabited the area primarily signi"ed by Eg. m33 by the time when the palatalization of AA *g > pre-OK 3 took place, and if (2) this was a very old (pre-OK) Eg. toponym borrowed before the palatalization as *mg3 and later treated as a native word (hence subject to the shift of PEg. *-g- > OK -3–), then one might eventually compare LECu.: Somali magãl-o “Stadt, Landschaft, Stadt mit dem umgebenden Gebiet” [Rn. 1902, 288] = “town” [Abr. 1964, 170], hence Somali-Jabarti mágal (coll.) “Männer, Volk” [Rn. 1904, 77] (with a shift of the basic mng.). This daring theory naturally has to be further investigated so it may be either rejected or veri"ed.
nb1: The representation of borrowed *-l in OEg. as -3 seems possible (cf. Vcl. 1972,
220; Hodge 1979, 933; 1990, 649–650).
nb2: The etymology of the Somali term is not entirely evident. The possibility, that
it represents the nomen loci of ECu. *gal- “to enter, go home” [Sasse 1979, 17; 1982,
76; Black 1974, 182], seems attractive, which H.-J. Sasse (p.c., 23 April 2007) does not
exclude (“It is very well possible that mag3lo is a ‘nomen loci’ derived from *gal-”), although
the anomaly of long -3- of Som. mag3lo vs. short *--- of ECu. *gal- (attested with
short -a- also in Som.) would have to be explained. D. Appleyard (p.c., 24 April
2007) voices his reservations: “unfortunately, the root meaning ‘enter, go home’ has a short
vowel, including in its Somali re"ex, gal, whereas ’town’ has a long 3 . . . . Besides, ma- is not a
productive formative in Somali”. M. Tosco (p.c., 24 April 2007), in turn, surmises that
it might be a loan from Ethiopian Semitic. On the other hand, Ch. Ehret (p.c., 24
April 2007) thinks that “the long-vowel structure of -3l would normally indicate that we are
dealing with a stem *mag- and a noun suf!x element *-3l”.

underlying Eg. biconsonantal root as *33 “rouler, turner”, whence he derived also
Eg. 33 [< *gl] “der Feuerbohrer” (Lit. MK, Wb V 511, 10) = “le drill à faire le feu
(un instrument agissant par la rotation)” (Lacau) = “"re-drill” (FD 318) and m33.t
“Meißel” (Wb, below) = “le perçoir (?), act. an instr. “que l’on manœuvrait avec
l’archet de menuisier” (Lacau). He equally correctly identi"ed Eg. *33 with Sem.
*gll, although he still regarded it as “impossible de dire si nous avons à faire à un mot
appartenant au présémitique, ou si les deux groupes de langues ont crée séparément ces deux mots
par une même dérivation en m sur un même radical ”. Similarly, W. Wessetzky (1958, 14;
1959, 90) conceived the lit. mng. of Eg. m33.t as “Rolle als etwas Abgeschloßenes,
das innerlich und äußerlich eine Einheit darstellt”, which he etymologically combined
with 3333.t “Kollegium” (OK, Wb, below), 33 “der runde Feuerbohrer” (Lit. MK,
Wb, above), and even m33.t “Saugrohr” (Med., Wb, q.v.). Doing so, he assumed “eine
charakteristische Ausdrucksweise, die den Gegenständen, die einender in der äußeren Form gleichen,
die gleiche Benennung gibt”. Wessetzky explained these forms from an Eg. *33j (sic, -j)
that he apparently equated with 33j “eig. kreuzen, bes.: den Fluß beim Überfahren”
(OK Wb V 511), which seems plausible, albeit not fully certain.

Following the old view expressed frequently in both Sem. and Eg. linguistics (lit.
infra), L. Kogan (SED l.c.) too has recently admitted the etymological connection
with the re#exes of AA *g-l “round” [GT]: “Sem. *gll/*glgl ‘to be round’ . . . may eventu
ally be the source of Sem. ‘skull’ ”. Note that Ar. CulCul-at- [Holma] and CalCal-at- [KB]
- as Kogan rightly remarked - “are not found in the available dictionaries”. For disproving
the Rösslerian etymology of Eg. 3333 cf. Takács 2006, 102–3.

! Alternative etymologies for Eg. m33.t can be safely excluded.
nb: (1) C.T. Hodge (1966, 45, #32) suggested a comparison of Eg. *33 > m33.t
with WCh.: Hausa cáárà (ts-) “to arrange (hair, of woman), align, compose, edit
(newspaper)” [Abr. 1962, 878]. (2) A.M. Lam (1993, 385): ~ Ful ma‰‰at3 “qui ne
se perd pas, document écrit”. (3) Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 193, #1764) combined Eg.
m33.t with Ar. m** “to wrap up the head”, Eg. m3.wt “bonds”, m3% “belt, girdle”,
and Cu. *maÁ- (*madl-) “to roll, twist”.
m&3.w “Widersacher” (PT 1237b, Wb II 187, 2; ÄWb I 580) = “adversary” (Faulkner).
nb: R. O. Faulkner (AEPT 293–4, utt. 683, n. 3) abstained from rendering m33
in PT 2048 (“?”) maintaining that m33.w of PT 1237 “can hardly be intended here”
(contra ÄWb l.c.).
! Derives (via m- pre"x of participles), as correctly suggested by E. Edel (AÄG 110, §256), from Eg. 33j “sich widersetzen” (PT, Edel) = “to act hostile, oppose, oppose o’self to (m)” (FD 318; DCT 812–3), cf. hence also 33j.tj “Widersacher” (PT, Wb V 519, 1) vs. 33j.w “Widersacher” (PT, ÄWb I 1491), 33j.t “1. Widersetzlichkeit, Übertretung, 2. Unheil, Böses” (MK, Wb V 518, 3) = “1. Unheil, Übel, Schaden, 2. Mißwuchs” (PT 1582a, ÄWb I 1491). Cp. still 3333 “to be hostile” (CT II 382e, DCT 818) = “feindlich sein” (ÄWb II 2824–5) > 3333 “1. feindlich (sein gegen jem.?), 2. Feind, Widersacher” (GR, Wb V 532–3).
nb1: H. Grapow (1914, 33) eventually explained PT m33.w from 33j “entgegen
strecken” following the fairly common view expressed also in other works (Wb V
514; FD 318; Hodge 1976, 17, n. 13; DCT 812–3) that the primray sense of 33j
was “den Arm feindlich ausstrecken nach jemandem, feindlich jemandem ent
gegenstrecken, sich feindlich in den Weg stellen” (Wb) ultimately originating “in
übertragener Bedeutung als feindliche Handlung” (Wb) from 33j “den Arm ausstrecken”
(Wb) = “to extend arm, stretch forth arms” (DCT), which, however, can hardly be
related with the motion verb 33j of various signi"cations (“1. eig. kreuzen, 2. bes.:
den Fluß zu Schiff überfahren, tr., 3. übersetzen, durchziehen, nicht im Schiff ”,
hence “4. etwas fortbringen, 5. an den Mund führen, 5. eine Speise verzehren”) as
suggested in Wb V 511–4. We are dealing here with the confusion of diverse roots
which cannot be discussed (cf. 33j).
nb2: Due to the diverse values of Eg. 3 (from PAA *g or *ç/*æ/**) and 3 (*r or *l),
the proper etymology of the underlying Eg. root (33j sich widersetzen”, above) is
not unambiguous:
(1) Sem. *gry “to be hostile” [Testen]: Akk. garû “bekämpfen”, garû “Feind” [GB]
= gerû “befehden, prozessieren”, g1rû “Feind, Gegner” [AHW 286] = gerû ~ garû

(Sem.: Djk. 1967, 196, fn. 55; Zbr. 1971, #61; Testen 1992, 75–76). D. Testen (l.c.)
suggested a possible Ar. cognate, namely C3riy-at- “girl, slave woman” (orig. perhaps
*”woman associated with the enemy” arguing that “raids in military campaigns were
presumably an important source of slaves for the early Arabs”). Both I. M. D’jakonov (l.c.)
and A. Zaborski (l.c.) assumed a Sem. bicons. *gr “to attack, begin a quarrel” [Zbr.]
based on the comparison of Sem. *gry with Sem. *gwr > Hbr. gwr qal “angreifen”

nb3: W. A. Ward (1962, 404–405) and C. T. Hodge (1976, 11, 17, n. 13; 1981, 407)

Wb V 604; ÄWb I 1509: 1st IMP; II 2852: MK) = “strange, stranger” (FD 324),
although its meaning “fremd, feindselig handeln gegen (r) den Bruder” (Wb V 604,
12) represents a late and secondary use. As correctly pointed out by E.S. Meltzer
(1991), Eg. 3r3r is to be connected rather with Sem. *gwr > Ug. gr “foreign resident”

Eg.-Sem. etymology to WCh. *gwirVm “slave” [Stl. 1987, 219], although this term
(with *-m as part of the original root, lit. “garçon”) is probably cognate rather to

AEB 84.321) = “Holzzapfen” (KHW 522 pace Montet, Kêmi 1, 1928, 9) = “Rundholz, Dübel, Pfosten (mit dem Rücken des Beils oder des Dechsels eingeschlagen, verbindet Holzteile oder dient als Pfosten zum Anlegen einer Seilbindung dem Belegen mit einem Tau oder also Stütze)” (Dürring 1995, 85–86: CT 133b) = “1.

nb1: Occurs in the CT lists of ship parts following immediately cords. Both R. O.
Faulkner (AECT l.c.) and R. Hannig (ÄWb l.c.) separate the m33.t of CT V 134a
as a distinct gloss (AECT: “wooden tube”, ÄWb: “Holzdübel”) from the rest of the
CT occurences (AECT “roller?”, ÄWb: “Gestänge”), while other authors (Bidoli,
Piccione, Dürring) treat these as one and the same lexeme.
nb2: The attestation in CT V 133b is highly disputed. G. Jéquier (l.c.) regarded the
-b- of m33b.t attested on the cof"n from Assuan (Cairo 28127) as an error for -3,
which he disconnected from m33b.t “écope” (q.v.). Jéquier equated the m33b.t in
question (of the Assuan cof"n) with CT V 134a m33.t of Cairo 42826 (cof"n from
Meir) that he considered as the correct form. The same view has been maintained
also in Wb II 189, 1 where m33b.t “als ein Teil des Schiffes” (CT, Cairo 28127) is
treated as “anscheinend verschieden vom vorstehenden Wort”, i.e., from m33b.t “Schöpfkelle”
(CT, Wb, below). So also FD 123: “drainer for bilge (?)” (distinguished from m33b.t
“bailer of boat”). Later, R. O. Faulkner (AECT II 34 & 38, spell 398, n. 29) and
D. Bidoli (1976, 73) also assumed in CT V 133b m33b.t of both G1T (cof"n of jqr,
from Gebelein, in Turin) and A1C (MK cof"n, from Assuan, Cairo 28127) an error
for m33.t, although in the M13C var. (cof"n of n0t, from Meir, Cairo 28055), only
m33– is legible and the end of the word is damaged. Most recently, in addition,
both R. van der Molen (DCT 194) and R. Hannig (ÄWb II 1172a) conceive CT
V 133b as an instance of m33b.t “bailer of boat” (FD 123; DCT) = “*Ab#uß (für
Leckwasser)” (GHWb 381, ÄWb).
nb3: As pointed out by P. Montet (1925, 339), the same lexeme may have an attesta
tion already in the OK (mastaba of Ti, Dyn. V) that has been, however, rendered
equivocally: “die Holzrollen, welche ein Schiffsbauer zimmert (n3r)” (Bidoli 1976,
72) = Grabstichel (für Bearbeitung von Stein und Holz, auch bei der Mundöffnung)”
(ÄWb I 580).
! The same word may be preserved in m33.t (Wb: with masc. var.?) “ein Zubehör des Netzes” (BD, Wb II 188, 11–12) = “quatre objets pointus: les bois autour desquels on les arrimait, crochets, bittes ou taquets” ( Jéquier 1911, 61, §18 rejecting “chaîne” by P. Renouf )

! The suggestive rendering as “Holzrolle”/“roller” by R. O. Faulkner (AECT II 110, spell 473, n. 20) and by D. Bidoli (1976, 72) implies a supposed etymological connection with (derivation from) Eg. m33.t “scroll” (supra), which has been reaf"rmed also by N. Dürring (1995, 85 & 86, fn. 208): “der äußeren Form nach von der Buchrolle abgeleitet”. He extended this comparison also to Med. m33.t “Saugrohr” (infra) that “im nautischen Kontext, als Schiffsteil ’eine Holzröhre als Seilführung’ oder ‘Au"age für das Spanntau’ ist denkbar”. In P. A. Piccione’s (1981–2, 75–76, 86) view, m33.t basically signi"ed “a cylindrically shaped object”, which was the source of diverse speci"c senses of m33.t, namely “peg”, “book-roll”, “oral brace”, and “chisel” (q.v.).

nb1: As pointed out by A.H. Gardiner (AEO I 72*, §181), the Wb II 188, 6–10
“wrongly queries” the rdg. of its logographic wtg. as m33.t.
nb2: Vocalized as *m°33'j (Osing 1998, 97, n. i).
nb3: Cf. also m33.t in Mag. Pap. Torino CG 54003 (MK) rendered as “tooth (part
of a snake)” lit. “chisel (?)” (Borghouts 1999, 171). Especially noteworthy is CT V

and D. Bidoli 1976, 73 as an error for m33.t, see above) is compared to the teeth
of Osiris. But this coincidence may well be accidental and m33.t “chisel” vs. m33.t
“a wooden tube (?)” (Faulkner) may represent two distinct lexemes.
nb4: J. Osing (1998, 117–8, n. d) assumed the masc. counterpart of our word to be
attested in m33j (wood det.) “(in einer Aufzählung von Geräten)” (late NK, Wb II
187, 4) occuring with the same wtg. also in Ostr. DeM 239 rt. 2:5 and Ostr. CG 25670
rt. 2:7 as well as in the Tebtunis onomasticon (2nd cent. AD) as m33 “Art Hacke (?)”
(Dem. gloss m3j). Henceforth, Osing (1998, 118, fn. 534) supposes to have resolved
the anomalous Genuswandel of Eg. m33.t vs. the Dem.-Cpt. re#ex (m) by deriving
the Dem.-Cpt. form directly from Eg. m33 of Tebtunis “ohne Genuswechsel”.
nb5: W. Westendorf (KHW 522) and D. Meeks (AL 77.1959) combined the Cpt.
re#ex with Eg. m33.t “Holzzapfen” (KHW) = “cheville de bois” (AL), which is
erroneous, the latter being a distinct lexeme (cf. above).

! Etymology disputed. " 1. J. H. Breasted (1930, 184): “possibly identical with” Eg. Med. m33.t “a wooden brace” (Breasted) = “Saugrohr” (Wb, infra). KHW 522: ~ Eg. m33.t “Holzzapfen” (supra). In P.A. Piccione’s (1981–2, 75–76, 86) view, m33.t basically signi"ed “a cylindrically shaped object”, which was the source of diverse speci"c senses of m33.t, namely “peg”, “book-roll”, “oral brace”, and “chisel” (q.v.). Semantically doubtful. " 2. P. Lacau (1954, 72, U28; 1972, 37, fn. 2) saw in it an instrument “que l’on manoeuvrait aussi avec l’archet de menuisier”, which made him explain it (as an m- pre"x nomen instr.) from Eg. *33 “rouler, tourner” and af"liate it with 33 “le drill à faire le feu (un instrument agissant par rotation)”, 3333.w “pot (fait au tour)”, 3333 “tête (comparée à un pot)” (cf. Lat. testa), m33.t “le rouleau de papyrus” ~ Sem. *gll > Hbr. gll “tourner” (for details cf. Eg. m33.t “scroll”). Plausible. " 3. G. Fecht (quoted in KHW 522) traced it back to a hypothetic Eg. etymon *m-w33.t > m33.t “das Eindringende” (sic, not in Fecht 1960). Baseless. " 4. W. Westendorf (KHW 113, fn. 2) saw in it an “m-Bildung von” Eg. w33 “wohlbehalten sein” arguing that Egyptians regarded “Meißel als Lebenserhalter”, cf. s«n0 “als Titel des Bildhauers: der am Leben erhält
(durch sein Kunstwerk)” (NK, Wb IV 47, 14) ~ s«n0 “als Bildhauer
bilden” (XX., Wb IV 47, 17). Far-fetched, especially because Westendorf failed in demonstrating the derivation of the nomen instr. from Eg. )w33 (whose primary sense is not identical with that of )«n0).
" 5. C.T. Hodge (1966, 45, #33; 1969, 109, #16) treated it as nomen instr.

identi"ed Sem. *.rr with Cpt. (S) jwr “to sharpen, whet” (CD) = “schärfen, wet
zen” (KHW). Nevertheless, the absence of earlier an Eg. evidence as well as the
preservation of Cpt. -r seem to suggest a late loan from Sem. rather than a cognate
(CED 318). Besides, Ward erroneously quoted the Sem. proto-root as *)r (sic, *)-!)

Schwert” (GR, Wb I 402, 7) = “knife or sword” (PL), but the perspective of their
derivation from a common biconsonantal Eg. *33 is baseless. Eg. w33.t is a very
rare and late word and its meaning “knife” may be secondary (originating from
the destructive force of the w33.t-eye, cf. PL 288). On the other hand, for other
alternative etymologies of Eg. 33 cf. Alb. 1927, #96; Clc. 1936, #934; Chn. 1947,
#312; Djk. etc. 1986, 48.
nb4: The Russian authors (MM 1983, 199; Djk. et al. 1986 MS, 38; Mlt.-Stl. 1990,

instead of Eg. 33) with Eg. n33.w “Splitter o.ä. (von Holz und Stein)” (MK, Wb II
377, 7–8) = “(a general word for) chip, splinter” (Harris) = “chips of stone” (FD

bois” (Vrg.) = “éclat de pierre, ostracon, grain de poussière” (Aufrère 1990, 101,
684). Independently from this false AA etymology, E. Edel (AÄG lxiv, §256.A)
also regarded the initial n- as a pre"x in the light of the comparison (followed by
J. Vergote 1973 Ib, 156 and J. ,erný in CED 308) with Cpt. (S) jh, (B) jhi “chip,
mote (of straw, dust)” (CD 747b) = “éclat” (Vrg.) = “Spreu, Schnitzel, Span, Split
ter, Staubkorn” (KHW 410). But the function of n- would require an explanation.
J. Vergote (1973 Ib, 156) assumed an original pre"x *m- > n-, but he failed to prove
the reason of such a shift. In addition, the Cpt. term has been alternatively derived

306) with the interchange of Eg. 0 ~ 3 supposed by E. E. Knudsen (1962, 35, §8).
More reasonable is the theory put forward by J. R. Harris (1961, 27, cf. also ZÄS
110, 1983, 169, fn. 208) on Eg. n33 < n3r “zimmern” (OK, Wb II 382, 11–16),

words from a common source. But it can hardly have been Eg. n3rj “fassen” (as

" 1. J. Breasted (1930, 184) regarded it as “possibly identical with” Eg. m33.t “some kind of chisel or graver” (q.v.) and also m33.t “part of fowling net” (q.v.). Similarly, in their lexicon of medical texts, H. von Deines and W. Westendorf (WMT I 415) have treated m33.t of Pap. Smith 3:14 (rendered lit. as “Meißel aus Holz, bei einer Kieferngelenksperre”) as identical with Eg. m33.t “Meißel”. Similarly, P. A. Piccione (1981–2, 75–76, 86) maintains m33.t to have basically signi"ed “a cylindrically shaped object”, which was the source of diverse speci"c senses of m33.t, namely “peg”, “book-roll”, “oral brace”, and “chisel” (q.v.). " 2. W.(V.) Wessetzky (1966, 145), followed by G. Takács (1994, 172), in turn, supposed an etymological connection with Eg. m33.t “Buchrolle” (above) because of the similarity of the two objects. So also N. Dürring (1995, 86, fn. 208): m33.t lit. “Rundholz”.
nb: Takács (l.c.) pointed out the similar derivation of Akk. gillu “ein Stück Rohr”
[AHW 288] = “cut reed” [CAD g 73] < Sem. *gll “to roll” [GT] (discussed s.v. Eg.
m33.t “scroll” supra). In this case, Eg. m33.t [< *mgl.t?] was an m- pre"x form.
" 3. GT: a derivation from AA *m-ç-r “to suck” (or sim.) [GT] seems very unlikely.

m&3 (phallus det.) “begatten” (NK hapax, Brunner 1964, 16) = “féconder” (AC 1978, 14) = “féconder, engendrer” (AL 78.1939, 78.1941) = “to be fertile” (DLE I 258) = “befruchten, begatten” (GHWb 380; WD II 70).
nb: H. Brunner (1964, 17, n. d ad text ILa) and D. Meeks (AL 78.1939) maintain that
it was merely a var. wtg. of m23 “das männliche Glied” (NK-GR, Wb II 175, 5, cf.
supra): “la véritable lecture de ce mot est sans doute *m23 . . .” (Meeks), “dessen allgemeiner Sinn
sich . . . aus Zusammenhang und Determinativ mit Sicherheit ergibt, wenn auch die Nuance offenble
ibt”. (Brunner). Nevertheless, no verbal mng. of m23 has been attested. In addition,
the Belegstellen ad Wb II 175, 5 list no single ex. of m23 written with -3–. Therefore,
if the rendering of m33 is correct, it is dif"cult to accept the identity of both words.
! If distinct from Eg. m23, the following possibilities are to be accounted for for further research: " 1. R. Hannig (GHWb 382) surmised that it might be perhaps akin to Eg. m3r (phallus det.) “?” (PT 233b hapax, Wb, v. infra). Uncertain, since its mng. is unknown. " 2. GT: the suggested meaning of Eg. m33 “to beget” could be euphemism < Eg. m3r “*pressen, drücken” (PT 1022d, ÄWb, below) ~ CCh.: Mbara mùgúl “presser, appuyer sur” [TSL 1986, 296].

Etymology highly debated and debatable. Most likely seems #2. " 1. D. Bidoli (l.c.): “sicher aus m33.t ‘Gestänge’ abgeleitet”, since this CT term signi"es in fact “Verbindungsstücke des Netzes, die aus dem Holz emporragen”. A denom. derivation seems doubtful, albeit an ultimate cognacy – in the light of AA *m-g-r (discussed in #5) – is not be excluded. " 2. R. Caminos (l.c.): “doubtless a var. of m03 ‘to fetter’ ” on the basis of the supposed interchange of Eg. 0 ~ 3 (cf. Goedicke 1955; Vycichl 1957, 71–73; Knudsen 1962, 33–36). Seems convincing.
nb: Caminos’ (1977, 28, fn. 12) reference to Goedicke (1955, 33) and Knudsen (1962,
35, §7) is, however, rather misleading, since in fact both of the quoted authors have
combined Eg. m03 with m3.t “Art Klammer oder Fessel” (PT, Wb, supra), which
can be certainly excluded.
" 3. L. H. Lesko (DLE I 258), admitting that m33 might be a var. to Eg. m03, alternatively assumed a connection with Eg. m3d “to press hard, crush” (OK, below), which was primarily motivated by the similarity of the dets. Evidently false for semantical considerations. " 4. R. Hannig (GHWb l.c.), in turn, surmised a link to both Eg. m03 (above) and m3.t “bonds” (PT, FD, supra). But the latter word certainly represents a separate root. " 5. GT: the (probably correct) comparison with Eg. m03 does not eventually rule out a relationship to AA *m-[g/–]-r “to tie (or sim.)”
[GT] which may be a var. root to AA *m-‘-r “1. to bind, 2. twist” [GT] that Eg. m03 (above) may eventually derive from.

m33b.t in the versions of G1T (MK cof"n from Gebelein, in Turin) and A1C (MK

138b-139a and 204m. Ignoring this mng., R. van der Molen (DCT 194) conceived
all CT instances of m33b.t (even CT V 133b) as “bailer of boat”. But as R. O.
Faulkner (FD 123) and N. Dürring (1995, 86) have stressed, in the case of CT V

nb2: Among the phonologically acceptable Sem. roots that might be alternatively
cognate to Eg. *33b, we "nd *glb, *grb, *)rb, although neither of these "t semanti
cally as perfectly as Sem. *3rp. Which alternative is correct can hardly be decided
with absolute certainty.
(1) If Eg. *33b primarily denoted “to take out, away” (or sim.), cf. Ar. Calaba “1.
(at)tirer, traîner, 2. (a)mener quelque objet, ou des esclaves, pour vendre, 3. ammener
qqn., apporter chez . . ., à . . ., 4. réunir, rassembler, attirer un grand nombre, une
foule (d’hommes)”, Caliba “se réunir, se rassembler, af#uer de tous côtés chez qqn.”,

[Lsl.] etc. (Sem.: DRS 116–7; Lsl. 1987, 189).
(2) Assuming a similar basic sense (“to take away from sg.”?) for Eg. *33b, one
might compare alternatively Sem. *grb > JAram. g2rab “fortnehmen, entreißen”
[Levy 1924 I 354] = “to rob, seize, levy” [ Jastrow 1950, 263], JPAram. g2rab

“couper, arracher”, g2rbät “"n”, gärbän “nain”, g2rbit “courte lance” [DRS] (Sem.:

“to shorten”, which may be perhaps the case also with Eg. 33b “Mangel” (LP, Wb
V 522, 5).

[BK I 1356–7]?
! Other etymologies for Eg. 33b are evidently out of question. " 1. C. Ceugney (1880, 9) explained it from a certain Eg. tbw (sic) “puiser”. " 2. C. T. Hodge (1969, 110, #32) equated Eg. *-33b with Ar. *araba “1. frapper, battre, 2. remuer etc.” [BK II 16–17] = “to beat, throw overboard” [Hodge] !!! LECu.: Somali *ur “Suppe aus dem Topf, Wasser aus dem Eimer schöpfen” [Rn. 1902, 141] = *úr-ayya “to scoop up”, *ar$r-ayya “to take the clean part of the water” [Abr. 1964, 51, 70] !!! WCh.: Hausa *úúràà “to pour liquid through narrow ori"ce, into bottle”, *úrààréé “to trickle out”, *àwrayàà “to plate, rinse” [Abr. 1962, 236], but neither of these comparanda can be accepted.
nb: Ar. )*rb (basic meaning “frapper”) is clearly unrelated with Eg. m33b.t and the
Somali and Hausa isogloss, which, in turn lack the trace of AA *-b > Eg. -b.
" 3. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 194, #1765) combined it with PSem. *m¿“to make go away”, Eg. m3r “to shout out, wall in”, m3.t “byre”, Afar m1*- “to choose, select, set apart”, ignoring that m- in Eg. m33b.t is clearly a pre"x.

Vycichl as 1916).
! J. Osing (NBÄ 256, 829, n. 1110) derived it from Eg. 33r “1. (tr.) etwas kochen, 2. (intr.) kochen” (GR, Wb V 526, 1–2) = “to boil, cook with water” (Edfu, PL 1220) assuming for the latter an unattested Grundbedeutung *“(ver)brennen”, whence he explained also Eg. 3r (Osing: act. *33r!) “Feuer” (GR, Wb V 595, 14) as well as Cpt. (SSf ) jwr “(mit Ruß) schwärzen, dunkel färben”, (S) joor(e)+ “ver"nstert, verborgen sein” (KHW 432 & fn. 6) and Cpt. caus. (SAL) jero, (S) jerw, (Sff ) jela, (B) Cero (CD 781b) = “brennen, anzünden, lodern”, + ebol “anbrennen, schwärzen, verkohlen” (KHW 431). Although Osing has convincingly demonstrated Eg. -3r > (S) -l as a regular shift (NBÄ 676–8, n. 755), he failed to "nd the reason for the lack of this change in (S) jwr and jero etc. < Eg. 33r, which “läßt sich noch nicht bestimmen”. This theory, which was uncritically adopted in KHW 523, has been rightly rejected (as “dif!cile à admettre”) by W. Vycichl (DELC 132) in the light of the (1) different structures, (2) the anomaly of -r vs. -l , and (3) the distinct basic senses (“soot” vs. “to cook”).
nb: J. ,erný (1971, 46) derived (SAL) jero etc. from *dj-0.t-r “Feuer legen an”
(Wb III 217, 12), while W. Westendorf (KHW 431) took it from GR 33r and 3r.
This was accepted by J. Osing (NBÄ 829, n. 1110), who found the Dem. wtg. 23j-r

m«33 “gain, pro"t” (Adoption Pap., rt. 5–6, Ramses XI, Grd. 1940,

GW for m«3/m33?) “Art Maß für Datteln” (Wb II 186, 15; Lange
1925, 78) < CT V 185a-d m«3.t “corn-measure” (AECT, cf. above).
This assumption is dubious, since the three instances of m3« (GW)
hardly be regarded as erroneous wtg. or occasional met. of *m«3.
nb: Gardiner argued that the metaphor of “basket for dates” > “pro"t” via “fruit
of labour” (cf. Gk. $)(/'7, Lat. fructus) resulted from the fact that “dates were valu
able annual produce of Eg. agriculture”. D. Meeks (1997, 44) “l’apparentement des deux mots
peu ne pas paraître évident, même si Gardiner propose un rapprochement sémantique entre ‘frui’
(dattes) et ‘fruit’ (du travail)”.
" 2. J. Hoch (1994, 177–8, §239) was inclined to treat it separately from Eg. m«33 (or GW for m«3 or m33?) “gain, pro"t” (above) and
“a basket measure for dates” (Pap. Harris I 37a:5), which, in his view, “are almost certainly distinct”. He vocalized m3« (GW) “produce, crops”
as *)am%a/*)ama0a (sic!), which he explained as a borrowing from NWSem. *)m% (or *)m0) “to grow” [Hoch]. Phonologically unacceptable. Rightly denying this suggestion, D. Meeks (1997, 43–44, §239) "rmly sided with Gardiner’s position, arguing that Hoch’s idea would require assuming a met. and a shift Sem. *% > Eg. « “qui est
des plus improbables et semble une création purement ad hoc”. In addition, Meeks pointed out an ex. of m«33 “mesure de dattes” written with
initial j- (Urk. IV 1992:3), “qui ne cadre pas avec l’idée qu’il puisse s’agir d’un emprunt”.

Gau” (Helck 1974, 128 with exx.) = “auch ein Ort zwischen Pr-[ j]ffj und Herakleopolis Magna” (!) (Kuhlmann 1992, 205) = “Medenit (Name des 22. oberägyptischen Gaus)” (FÄW 204: "rst III.; ÄWb I 1558; II 2953).
nb1: The original spelling of the name has been reconstructed diversely. No agree
ment as to whether its C2 was *-3– or *-d-: *m3nj.t (Nims l.c.; Fecht 1960, 226–7,
Nachtrag zu §315; Helck, LÄ IV 112; Kuhlmann l.c.) = *mdnj.t (Helck 1974, 128;
ÄWb l.c.) = *m9nj.t, i.e. *mdnj.t (FÄW l.c.; Kahl 1994, 552, 922). The linguistic
evidence analyzed below speaks for *-3–.
nb2: Written logographically until the MK (therefore the OK spelling cannot be
deduced from the contemporary wtg.), but the original mng. of the underlying
ideogram is debated (Fecht 1960, 227: “das Gauzeichen ohne Standarte dargestellt” was
“jünger als die meisten Anderen”). Its (probably) earliest instance from Dyn. III (Kahl
1994, 552) contains the hrgl. K6 depicting a “"sh-scale” (Grd. 1927, 467) horizon
tally. In the late OK, in turn, e.g., in the biography of Uni (Urk. I 101, 105) and
the Weltkammer (Helck 1974, 128), “die Hrgl. zeigt vielleicht ein ‘gestopftes Loch’ und setzt
sich wohl aus der horizontal gelegten Loch-Hieroglyphe . . . sowie einem das Loch begrenzenden
‘Damm’-Strich zusammen” (Kuhlmann 1992, 206, fn. 50–51, for the hrgl. “Darstellung
eines stehender Schutzgrabens” cf. also Grd., JEA 6, 1920, 104 & t. 11). But as rightly
noted by Ch.F. Nims (1952, 346), the form of this late OK logogram of m3nj.t (Uni,
Weltkammer) somewhat resembles the hrgl. U8 depicting a “hoe, without the rope
connecting the two pieces” (Grd. 1927, 502) = “a cutting tool” (Nims 1952, 346 &
fn. 29) = “Schneidewerkzeug, eine Art Messer oder Muschelschale (?)” (Helck, LÄ
IV 112 referring another hrgl.: L6 “bivalve shell”), which is a associated in PT 278
with 3nj “to dike” (Nims) = “abdämmen” (ÄWb I 503) and in PT 716bT with 3nj.t
“quarter moon day, part day” (Nims) = “Monatsviertel (7. Monatstag als erstes
Viertel der Mondphase, Monatsfest)” (ÄWb I 1478), which was objected by A. H.
Gardiner (1927, 507, V11, n. 1): “the det. of 3nÕ in Pyr. 278, 716, namely a kind of hoe,
cannot well be the prototype of of our sign” (V11: “cartouche cut in half ”).
nb3: Identi"ed as by W. Spiegelberg (OLZ 23, 1920, 259, fn. 1) with A9f5%, which
was correctly rejected by A. H. Gardiner ( JEA 9, 1923, 7, n. 8) as a proposal
made “on rather slender grounds” since “it is on the wrong side of the Nile for a traveller
coming from the Wâdy Na9rûn” (cf. Peasant R 38), although later Gardiner (AEO
II 120*) also admitted that “occasionally the Fayyûm was reckoned as part of the XXIInd
nome”. In addition, Ch.F. Nims (1952, 344–5 & fn. 23) "rmly maintained that it
was the name of the nome. For the problem of m(-)dnj.t in Merikare (P) 98–99 cf.
Burkard 1977, 261.
nb4: Vocalized as *má3nay/t (Vrg.) = *ma3ånj.'t (Kuhlmann). Its earliest full wtg.
(with phonograms) in Peasant R38 reads mdnj.t (with -d-), which may be due to
the shift of old 3 > d (late OK by MK). The LP var. mdn.w (m) is re#ected also
*m!nj.t

dessen ältere Form”.
nb5: K. P. Kuhlmann (1992, 207) assumed a process of *ma3åánj.'t > *madåá"- >
*mad!"- > *mato(e/i) evidenced, i.a., by the var. mdj.t (Peasant A5) displaying the
positional erosion of -n- before -j- (cf. Peust 1999, 157, §3.14.5) seen also in dnj.t
“Teil, Anteil” (Wb V 465), i.e., *dånj.'t > *d!- > Cpt. (S) toe, to, ta, toei, (B) toi,
(P) tooe, (SaAL) taie, (AL) taeie “Teil, Anteil” (KHW 219). Moreover, Kuhlmann
projects an odd association in the story of the Eloquent Peasant between MK mdnj.t
(Kuhlmann: *Mato) vs. mrj-jtm (Maydum) and a hypothetic *mrj-dnj.t (lit. “who
desired share”) " Cpt. (S) mai-to referring to 3%wtj-n0t.w, “der nur auf seinen Gewinn
bedachte Gutsverwalter aus dem Landkreis von Mdnj.t:Mato”, whose "gure in the story “war
für den Ägypter ein lebendes Beispiel des ‘Habgierigen’, auf Ägyptisch auch mrj-dnj.t (n-%3w)
‘einer, der (viele) Anteile liebt’ ”, cf. Cpt. (S) mNtmaitoNHouo “Habsucht” (KHW 219)
misquoted by Kuhlmann with -NHoou (sic, -Hoou) “Habgier”. A similar change is
to be observed with Eg. dnj.wt (usually written with the hrgl. V11) “bellow, cry”
(DCT 780) = “Geschrei (Mensch)” (ÄWb II 2791) = “shriek” (Grd.) that occurs
in the MK (Sinuhe, Peasant, and once CT) “infolge Wegfall des n” (Wb V 466, 10)
also as dj.wt (written, a.o., with the ideogram of dj “5”). Although A. H. Gardiner
(1927, 507, V11, n. 5) has warned that “it seems doubtful whether the hieratic word . . . was
originally written with this sign” (i.e., V11), the var. lacking -n- is attested also in CT
V 221a (vars. B1C, B2L): (nb-k3.w) kh3 dj.wt=f “lord of the bulls who bellow his
cry” replaced in other versions by (nb-mt.wt) k3 djw “lord of the seed of the "ve
bulls” (AECT II 58 & 59, spell 407, n. 15).
! Whether mtn.w and mdn.w (written for mtn.w?) “Messer” (GR, Wb II 182, 10; Jéquier 1921, 210, fn. 2 pace Brugsch) = mdn.w “couteau” (Vrg.) = “knife, axe” (GR Edfu, PL 476) stems from the same root (as suggested e.g. by J. Vergote 1973 Ib, 155) appears to be highly doubtful.
nb: Queried also by Ch.F. Nims (1952, 346 & fn. 31): “as to whether mdn(w), ‘knife’, of
the Greek period comes from the name of the (22nd UEg.) nome or from the old word *m3nÕt, there
is no evidence . . .”. Cf. rather Eg. (CT) m2n.wt “Art Beil” > (LP-GR) mtnj.t “Messer”
(Wb, v. supra). The misleadingly similar late wtg. of the old name *m3nj.(t) of the
22nd UEg. nome as mdn.w (with knife det., AEO II 120*) may be due to a con
tamination of two separate lexemes.
! As suggested by Ch.F. Nims (1952, 343–6), G. Fecht (1960, 226–7, Nachtrag zu §315), J. Vergote (l.c.), and K. P. Kuhlmann (1992, 206), it may be explained as an “Instrumental- bzw. Lokativbildung zu” (Kuhlmann) Eg. 3nj “1. (PT) abdämmen (auch: gegen das Wasser), (die Ufer) befestigen (mit Stein), stopfen (Topf ), 2. (BD) jemanden zurückhalten, von etwas fernhalten, (an einem Tun) hindern” (Wb V 464, 10–17 & 575, 9; ÄWb I 1503; II 2790 vs. 2842) = “to sunder, divide, distribute, dam off ” (Grd. 1920, 104, fn. 5) = “to dam off, restrain” (Grd. 1927, 507) = “1. to dam (water), construct dam, 2. hold back, restrain s’one, 3. revet earthen banks with stone” (FD 314) = “1. couper (!), 2. barrer” (Vrg.) = “1. abdämmen, befestigen,
844 *m!nj.t



845
2. zurückhalten” (Kuhlmann). There is no agreement as to whether it is a nomen loci or instr. In the view of Nims (1952, 346 & fn. 29), “it seems probable that the origin of the nome sign was a cutting tool named *m3nÕt, a feminine nomen instr. formed by m pre!xed to the root”. Similarly, W. Helck (1974, 128; LÄ IV 112) saw in it a nomen instr. signifying a “Schneidewerkzeug, eine Art Messer oder Muschelschale (?)”. But Fecht (1960 l.c.) hold it equally possible that we are dealing either with “eine m-Bildung mit der Bedeutung des Part. Passiv: ‘der (das) Abgeteilte, Abgeschnittene’ oder Part. Aktiv: ‘der (das) Abgeteilende, Abgeschneidende’ ” (cf. Grapow 1914, 14; AÄG §253–6) or perhaps an abstract noun “Abtrennung, Abdämmung” (arguing that “diese Bezeichnung würde recht gut zu dem Grenzgau passen, dessen Nordgrenze ja tatsächlich Ober- und Unterägypten ‘abtrennt’ ”). Fecht regarded it also possible that it alternatively “das Grenzgebiet als das ‘(von Unterägypten) Abgetrennte, Abgeschnittene’ bezeichnet”. Kuhlmann (l.c.), in turn, reconstructed the literary sense of *m3nj.t (nomen loci) as “ein Ort, wo ein Damm, Wassergraben existiert” " “ein Schutzdamm gegen die Nil#ut”.
nb1: The etymology of Eg. 3nj has been debated. The primary form of this very
root had 3– (PT 278c, ÄWb I 1503). But the assumption that “die . . . mit dem Zeichen
[V11] geschriebenen Wörter haben ursprünglich den Stamm 3nj gehabt” (Wb V 464, 7 &
575, 8) can hardly be extended to all the (eventually unrelated) words written so.
R. Hannig listed an alleged OK (Dyn. V) ex. of 3nj “abdämmen” written as dnj
(ÄWb I 1478), which was not commented on by D. Meeks (2005, 259). Gardiner
(1927, 507, V11), followed by Nims (1952, 346) and Fecht (1960, 227, Nachtrag
zu §315), has suggested that Eg. 3nj “to dam” in fact “may originally have meant ‘cut
off’; cf. the later word dnÕt ‘portion’, ’fraction’ . . .” (Sethe 1916, 89), which would imply
an ultimate etymological connection with MK dn “1. abschneiden (Köpfe), töten
(Feind, Seele)” (CT, ÄWb II 2790) = “to cut off (heads), kill s’one” (DCT 797–8)
as well as MK dnj “aus-, zuteilen” > dnj.w “Anteil (was zusteht)” (ÄWb II 2791) =
dnj “to share out” > dnj.w “share, portion” (FD 314). The earliest certain instances
of both roots are, however, attested with d-. Note that both obscure PT exx. for
dnj (with d-) “aus-, zuteilen” (listed in ÄWb I 1478) were rendered differently by
R. O. Faulkner. PT 1284b: ndnj “to be cut up (?)” (AEPT 203) vs. PT 1965a: dnj
“to shape” as a metaphorical use of OK dn “to knead” (AEPT 284–5, utt. 669,
n. 9). CT V 381b 3nj (with 3–) “has been tentatively identi!ed with” MK dnj “to share
out (?)” (AECT II 98–99, spell 468, n. 2; DCT 799). Nevertheless, all these factors
make the supposed relationship of Eg. 3nj “to dam” vs. dn “to cut off ” vs. dnj “to
share” rather unlikely.
nb2: If Eg. 3nj (from *gny or *çny) represents distinct root, it might be akin either

tioned already by Th. Schneider (1997, 207 #107), but he erroneously quoted Eg.
9nj (i.e., dnj). (3) The comparison with Sem. *dlw “to draw water” proposed by
C. T. Hodge (1976, 13, #79) cannot be accepted either semantically or phonlogi
cally (Eg. 3– + Sem. *d-).

! Origin not clear with full certainty. Most likely seems #5. " 1. W. M. Müller (1909, 190, fn. 1), W. F. Albright (1918, 225), and G. R. Castellino (1984, 12) think Eg. m3r to be somehow related to m3d “treffen” (PT, Wb, below) = “to press” (Alb.). W. Vycichl (1933, 179) was even disposed to see in PT 498c m3r a hapax meaning “treffen”. But an interchange of Eg. r ~ d has not been justi"ed by convincing examples. " 2. W. F. Albright (1918, 225, #29), in addition, equated both Eg. m3r and m3d with Ar. ma)ara I “1. traire une femelle avec le bout des doigts, 2. tirer tout ce qu’il y avait de lait dans les pis” [BK II 1115] = “to milk by squeezing the teats between the "ngers” [Alb.], which is semantically doubtful.
nb: For the Ar. root cp. rather ECh.: WDng. mì*yìrè “sucer” [Fédry 1971, 131],
EDng. mí*yíré “sucer” [Dbr.-Mnt. 1975, 203]. It is not excluded, although it would
have to be demonstrated that the Ar.-Dangla isogloss comes from the primary sense
“to wring out (milk)” (cf. AA *m-[ç]-r “to turn, twist” [GT] discussed below). Less
probably, cf. CCh.: Gude mur2*2 “to pinch between thumb and knuckle of index
"ngers” [Hsk. 1983, 245].
" 3. W. Vycichl (1933, 179) rendered Eg. m3r as an m- pre"x form of a hypothetic Eg. *3r “packen, greifen” (postulated also in KBIÄF 160), on the analogy of NBrb.: Shilh: Tazerwalt g°r “anfassen” > mégg/r (m- “der Sozietät und Reziprozität”) “zusammentreffen” [Feichtner 1932, 218], with which he directly compared the Eg. root deduced from Eg. n3rj “fassen, packen” (OK, Wb II 382–3) = “to take hold of ” (Allen 1984, 582) and 3r.t “Hand” (Vcl.: lit. *“Greifer”). This derivation of Eg. m3r is ab ovo dubious (“to turn” + “to seize”). The etymological connection of Eg. n3rj vs. 3r.t and r3j “to give” (via met. < *3rj), which appears to be equally unconvincing, has been suggested and maintained also by a number of authors, e.g., K. Piehl (1893, 253), K. Sethe (1912, 96), K.M. Feichtner (1932, 224), F. von Calice (GÄSW 168–9, #684), P. Lacau (1972, 35, §40), and P. Kaplony (KBIÄF 160, n. 208). Neither of these Eg. comparanda has been etymologically clari"ed. This is why Vycichl’s proposal concerning Eg. m3r and 3r.t is highly problematic.
nb1: The common Brb. pre"x m- “der Sozietät, Reziprozität” [Feichtner] can hardly be
projected to Eg. m-. In any case, it has so far not been demonstrated on the basis
of a convincing etymological evidence.
nb2: Eg. 3r.t (< *gr-t) “Hand” (PT, Wb V 580–589), var. 33.t “Hand” (PT, Wb V

OHbr. zeret, Syr. zart3 “span (as measure)” represent probably an early (MK or even

*zart- (as pointed out by Lambdin 1953, 149–150; Conti 1976, 267, fn. 18) and
by no means cognate to it (as maintained by numerous authors: Bondi 1894, 132;
Sethe 1912, 94; Alb. 1918, 90; Farina 1924, 324; Ember 1930, #24.c.1; Yeivin 1932,
73, fn. 6; Brunner 1969, 88, #483; Ward 1972, 22, #293). Besides, Müller (1909,
191) declined any connection between the Eg. and Hbr. forms. (3) The comparison
of Eg. 3r.t with Sem. *3ir3«- “shoulder, arm” (suggested by Yeivin 1932, 73, fn. 6;
Bomhard 1984, 218; Bla&ek 1989 MS Om., 16, #52) is to be rejected, since Eg.
3 & Sem. *3, and there is no match for Sem. *-« in Eg. (4) E.A. Knauf (1982,
37, fn. 19) combined Eg. 3r/3.t with Akk. q3tu “hand”, but these have nothing in
common either (Eg. 3 & Akk. q, while Eg. -r- & Akk. -3-). (5) The same is valid
about C.T. Hodge’s (1979, 497) comparison of Eg. 3r.t with Ar. 9arr-at- “#ank” and
Brb. *a-*er “leg” (Eg. 3 & Sem. *9, while Eg. 3 vs. Brb. ** is in principle possible).
(6) Th. Schneider (1997, 208, #116): ~ Qbl. i-3il “Arme, Elle” ! Mzg. i-3il “Arm,
Vorderarm, Elle” !! Trg. *a-3il “(ganzer) Arm”, but Eg. 3– + Brb. *3- < AA *"-/*0-,
while the Cpt. evidence suggests an old Eg. /-r-/ (not /*-l-/).
nb3: The origin of Eg. n3rj is still just as uncertain as whether its initial n- was a
pre"x as Vycichl, Feichtner, and others (l.c. supra) presumed. (1) GT: most prob
able seems its connection with Sem. *n)l “herausziehen, herausfallen” [Soden] =
“herausreißen” [AHW] > Akk. (OBab.) na)3lu “hinausbringen (??)” [AHW 755] !!
Hbr. n)l qal “herausziehen, -reißen” [GB 517–8] = “to split, plunder, deliver, drop
off ” [Guillaume], Off.Aram. n)l “1. to (re)take, remove, 2. save, preserve” [DNWSI

“to detatch, separate” [Lsl. 1987, 404–5] (Sem.: Lsl. 1958, 34–35; Guillaume 1965
II, 25). W. von Soden (1968, 177) supposed a pre"x n- in this Sem. root. (2) GT:
or cp. perhaps Sem.: JNAram. ngl “to tidy, put things away” [Sabar 2002, 229] !
Yemeni Ar. naCal I “to transport, unload”, II “to strip off, take off etc.” [Piamenta
1990–1, 479], Dathina nCl “transporter, décharger” [GD 2748]? (3) A. Ember
(1913, 120, #96, 121; 1930, §12.a.18, §24.b.5), W. F. Albright (1927, 223), and C. T.
Hodge (1984, 416) combined Eg. n3rj with Sem. *n.r “to watch observe” [Ember]
!!! WCh.: Hausa cáórè (ts-) “to guard, keep the eyes open” [Brg. 1934, 1030], which
is rather unconvincing semantically. (4) V. Orel & O. Stolbova (1992, 198; HSED
#957) equated it with ECh. *)g-w-r “to catch” [GT]: Ndam goore “to catch” [Stl.
< ?] ! Sokoro góuree “angreifen” [Lks. 1937, 33]. GT: cp. still SCu. *ger- “to take”
[GT] > Irq. gagar- & Alg. geger- “to carry” ! Qwd. gel- [-l- < *-r-] “to choose” !
Ma’a -géra “to bring” (SCu.: Ehret 1980, 237). (5) GT: similarly unconvincing is
the equation with Sem.: Akk. galû “in die Verbannung gehen” [AHW] !! Tigre gäla
“to take away, carry off ” [Lsl.] (Sem.: Lsl. 1964, 116) !!! WCh.: Klr. gul “nehmen”
[ Jng. 1970, 352]. (6) E. E. Knudsen (1962, 36, §27) saw in it a var. to Eg. 0nr “ein
sperren” (MK, Wb III 295) via met. and on the basis of the supposed interchange
of Eg. 0 ~ 3, which appears even less likely. (7) Ch. Cannuyer (1983, 27), in turn,
analyzed it as pre"x n- + Eg. 3r “fernhalten von, einen Zustand beseitigen, Fuß
aufhalten” (PT, Wb V 595, 5–9) = “retenir, faire obstacle, empêcher” (Cannuyer).
Semantically weak. (8) Naturally, Eg. n3rj can have nothing in common with CCh.

" 2. GT: in theory, Eg. m3r may be derived from *mgl perhaps re#ected also by CCh.: Mbara mùgúl “presser, appuyer sur” [TSL 1986, 273, 296]. " 3. GT: or, if it stems from an earlier *mgr, cp.

rather Eg. m43 (above).

" 5. K. Sethe (1892, 54), followed by G. R. Castellino (1984, 12), treated MK m3d “drücken usw.” (infra) as a late var. (!) of old Eg. m3r, but both he and Castellino failed to etymologically demonstrate the alleged shift of old Eg. -r > MK -d. Alternatively, Sethe assumed an erosion of old m3r > *m3j > *m3, which was extended by an af"x -d in the MK. False. Rejected already by W. M. Müller (1909, 190 and fn. 1) as a “desperate explanation” (instead, he assumed an original *m3r, whereby -d appeared from the dissimilation of -3–, i.e., *m3[{]3[{] > *m3[{]d[{], which is equalls unconvincing). There was no Systemzwang of obligatory triconsonantization at all in Eg. Moreover, Eg. m3d is attested already in the OK. Later, Sethe (1899, §361) gave a third etymological solution: pre"x m- + *3r " m3r “(zusammen)pressen” " *m3j + af"x -d " m3d (rejected by E. Otto ÄMÖR II 61).
nb: Nevertheless, Sethe’s mistaken hypothesis may contain perhaps at least one
element of scienti"c truth, namely that we may not rule out the possibility that Eg.
m3r (provided < *mçr) and m3d (provided < *mçd) eventually stemmed from the
same PAA biconsonantal root, i.e., *m-ç “to press” (or sim.) [GT] (for details cf.
Eg. m3d infra). How the occasional MK var. m3r (XII., Wb II 89, 9) of old m3d
(whose basic mng. has been reconstructed by K. Sethe 1892, 55 equally as “pressen,
drücken”) to all this would be premature to decide.

nb4: The rendering and etymology of Ug. m)r “Gebiet (?)” [WUS #1644] =
“territoire (?)” [Caquot & Sznycer apud DUL] = “campo” [Mrs.] = “stronghold”
[de Moor apud DUL] = “sob” [DUL 587–8] has been strongly debated. G. del
Olmo Lete & J. Sanmartín (DUL l.c.) suggest a derivation from Ug. n)r “to sob”
[DUL 647].
nb5: The etymology of the Sem. name of Egypt has been also equivocal in the
lit. Thus, e.g., Halévy ( JÉS 13, 12 quoted in GB 454) derived it from the primary
sense “border”. P. Haupt (ZDMG 64, 710; AJSL 26, 216f., cf. GB 454) explained
this from the primary sense “Festung” assuming the underlying verbal root to have
been preserved by Hbr. )rr “zusammenbinden” [GB] (discussed below). O. Bates
(1914, 258, fn. 8), in turn, proposed the absurd idea (albeit “with great reserve”)
that Hbr. mi)rayim is related to Brb. *)m-z-3 with the “permutation” of *-3 >
-r. Alternatively, he took it from Akk. mu)ri (sic) “1. part of Cappadocia, 2. place
in the Anti-Taurus” assuming that the special toponym perhaps yielded a general
term. False. É. Naville (1917, 230–1) treated Hbr. mi)rayim as a secondary form
of Hbr. m3).r (quoted as m2).r) rendered literally as the “enclosed land connected
with the walls (built on the eastern frontiers to prevent invasion from the Sinaitic
peninsula)” and rejected Spiegelberg’s (l.c. infra) assumption that the Sem. term was
merely a “transcription” of Eg. m3r “wall” (since “it would be rather extraordinary to
!nd a regular Sem. dual to an Eg. word”, he suggested that Hbr. mi)rayim wass probably
a “translation” of Eg. m3r). W. von Soden (AHW), however, explained the Can.
and Ar. name of Egypt as a loan borrowed ultimately from Akk. mi)ru, in which,
in turn, he saw a deverbal noun of Akk. ma)3ru (above). E. Lipi+ski (1992, 139,
§1.2), on the other hand, maintains that the name has come originally from Can.
*mi)ru (sic) akin to Akk. mi)ru signifying in fact “territoire, c’est-à-dire une étendue
délimitée de terre dépendent ouvertes aux nomades”.
nb6: For the Hbr. dual ending too, diverse theories have been proposed. W. Spiegel
berg (1899, 40–41) took the Hbr. term from an etymon *me)er (sic) “Mauerland” akin
to Eg. j.mdr. He argued that, since the alleged Eg.-Sem. unity (!) must have preceded
the conception of Egypt as “Two Lands” (Eg. t3.wj), the Hbr. dual in fact re#ects
a borrowing from Eg. in a later period after the uni"cation of Egypt. Alternatively,
Spiegelberg supposed that Hbr. mi)rayim comes from Eg. *m3r with the primary
sense “Doppelmauer”, since “an einer Reihe von noch erhaltenen ägyptischen Festungen
läßt sich eine doppelte Mauer oder Umwallung nachweisen”. On the other hand, F. Buhl (GB
454) assumed that “die Endung ist wahrscheinlich keine Dual-, sondern eine Lokalendung . . .,
falls nicht (wie Jensen ZDMG 48, 439) urspr. *mi)r5m gemeint ist”. É. Naville (1917,
230–1) derived Hbr. mi)rayim from its Hbr. var. m3).r (misquoted as m2).r) “Egypt”
[KB 623; GB 453], whose literary mng. he rendered as “enclosed land” (!) argu
ing that Egypt was referred to herewith as “the two enclosures”. E. Lipi+ski (1992,
139, §1.2), following Buhl (quoted above), thinks that the Hbr. dual ending has
nothing to do with the duality of LEg. vs. UEg. ( just as Hbr. nah-rayim does not
denote the “Land of Two Rivers”). Instead, Hbr. -ayim ~ -ayin was rather an
ending of place names (as in Hbr. "eprayim, dotayin, %or.nayim, s/parwayim,
yir$š3layim).
nb7: The isogloss of Sem. *mi)r- and Eg. m3r is supposed in the lit. to have originated
from the very same biconsonantal root (attested in both AA branches), cf. Sem. *)rr

“8. réunir, rassembler” [BK I 1383]. One is disposed to agree with P. Marrassini
(1971, 103–4) who found it dif"cult to judge the relationship of Sem. *mi)r- (perhaps
pre"x *ma- ?) to Sem. *)rr vs. *)wr. The same is valid of Eg. m3r that has been
usually treated as the m- pre"x form of )3r (below), although the way of derivation
has not been perfectly clari"ed. The problem of Eg. m3r vs. Sem. *mi)r- ~ Sem.
*)rr vs. *)wr requires, however, further investigation.
nb8: The origin(s) of Hbr. m3).r is (are) uncertain. Th. Nöldeke (ZA 21, 381) equated
it with Ar. m)r “auspressen” (!), while F. Buhl (GB 453) explained its 3rd mng. via
borrowing from Akk. ma))artu ~ man)artu “Bewachung, Wache” [AHW 620b].
Similarly, KB 623 suggested the following alternative etymologies for Hbr. m3).r
II: (1) from ))wr or (2) nomen loci of )n)r or (3) borrowed from Akk. ma))artu
(above) ~ Ar. manKar-at- “place with a wide view, watchtower” [KB]. Note that
these forms are distinguished from Hbr. m3).r (“le nom poétique” for Egypt), which
E. Lipi+ski (1992, 139, §1.2) explained as a loan borrowed “probably” from an Akk.
var. form mu)ur (sic, not con"rmed in the lit.).
nb9: In the works of the “old school”, Sem. *)rr vs. *)wr > Sem. *mi)r- vs. Eg. m3r
have been usually equated with Eg. *3r reconstructed on the basis of the phon. value
of the hrgl. depicting in the OK a “bundle of green stems, of #ax”, later a “basket
of fruit” (Grd. 1927, 473: M36–38) = “(signe "gurant) un lien, un paquet” (Cohen)
= “rather a sheaf ” (Ward) > (?) 3r “basket used as a trap (?)” (DCT 846) as well as
a number of the most diverse Eg. parallels the relationship of which is, however,
problematic: 3r “fernhalten von jem. (r), einen Zustand beseitigen, Fuß (Schreiten)
aufhalten” (PT, Wb I 595, 5–9) = “to hinder, obstruct” (FD 323) = “aufhalten (Fuß,
Schritt), beseitigen (Zustand, Hunger)” (ÄWb I 1507–8: PT; ÄWb II 2851: CT, MK
Lit.), 3r (wall det.) “als Bez. für ein primitives Grab in der Fremde” (Lit. MK 1x,
Wb V 598, 12) = “primitives Grab (im Ausland)” (ÄWb II 2852), cf. also 3r (wall
det.) “als Ortsname: Djer (ein Weinort)” (Urk. I 64:2, ÄWb I 1579; Wb V 598, 11),
3rj (wall det.) “Umfassungsmauer, Einfassung” (OK, ÄWb I 1509 pace Gdk. 1967
KDAR 228–230, "g. 31), 3rj.t “wall (?)” (FD 323) = “*Mauer, Palissade” (MK,
ÄWb II 2852), 3r.w “walls” (MK, FD 324) = “*Mauern (des Hauses)” (CT, ÄWb
II 2852), 3r.w “Ende, Grenze” (PT, Wb V 585–9), 3rj “ein-, umschließen” (CT I
386a, ÄWb II 2852), 33r “Bedürfnis” (MK, Wb V 524–5) = “distress, need” (Ward
pace FD 319). Lit. for this bicons. Eg.-Sem. etymology: Spg. 1899, 39–41; Ember
1911, 94; 1930, §12.a.50; Clc. 1935, #375; Vrg. 1945, 147, §24.c.10; Cohen 1947,
#311; Ward 1962, 402–3 (with a few erroneous Sem. comparanda like Akk. u)urtu,
Hbr. y)r). W. Spiegelberg (l.c.) derived Eg. 3r( j) “einwickeln”, 3r.w “Grenze”, 3r( j)
“Mauer, Wall”, and m3r (m- pre"x, lit. “was Umschließt” " “Wall”) > denom.
verb m3r “umschließen”, from Eg. *3r ultimately related to Sem. *)r > Hbr. )wr
vs. )rr. He identi"ed Eg. m3r directly with Hbr. m3).r “wall (Mauer)”, which he

855
die bisherigen Versuche, von welchen keine annehmbar ist”). In the light of the PT evidence,
Spiegelberg maintained that the “Grenzmauern bei den Bitterseen schon für die älteste Zeit
anzunehmen haben” and supposed that “daß dieses Bollwerk, welches den semitischen Nomaden
den Eingang in das fruchtbare Niltal wehrte, für die Semiten den Namen für das gesamte Land
ebgeben konnte, ist mir durchaus nicht unwahrscheinlich. Ursprünglich bezeichnete der Name gewiß
nur das Delta . . . später aber . . . ganz Ägypten”. Even further went A. Badawy (1952–4,
140–1), who derived Eg. m3r from an Eg. *3r “écarter” based on the (often dubi
ous) comparison of s3r “forteresse”, 3rj.t “salle, chambre”, 3r.wt “sarcophage”, 3r.w
“famille, parent”, 3r “"n, limite”, 3r “obstacle, obsctruction”, 3r.w “mur”, 3rj “être
éloigné, écarter”, 3r.t “main”, 3r.w “crâne”, whose problems cannot be analyzed
here in detail. C. T. Hodge (1969, 11–12), in addition, considered the ultimate con
nection of the Sem. name of Egypt with Eg. m33j, Akk. mi)ru “boundary”, and
Eg. 3r.w “boundary” (supra) to be “likely”.
nb10: Note that for Eg. 3r.w “border” (frequently connected with these Eg. m3r ~
Sem. *mi)r-, cf. above), a few alternative etymologies should also be considered:
(1) E. Zyhlarz (1932–33, 173) and J. Vergote (1971, 44) combined it with Bed. gil
“Grenze, Ziel” [Rn. 1895, 95]. Rejected by Vcl. 1960, 262; 1978, 75. The Bed.
word may be connected rather with Nub. kel “Grenze” [Rn.]. In addition, the
Cpt. re#exes, e.g., (OSALMBF) thr= vs. (SB) tar (KHW 241–2) with -r- instead
of *-l-, also speak against the Eg.-Bed. equation. (2) C. T. Hodge (1966, 47, #99;
1969, 108, #13) proposed a connection with WCh.: Hausa càrnúú (ts-) “slender
post for fencing” and even cáráá (ts-) “middle of back from neck to coccyx” [Abr.
1962, 878–9], which is semantically very weak (for Hs. cáráá cp. rather Sem.
*.ahr- “back”). (3) GT: ~ Brb. *-grur “enclosure, fence, wall” [Mlt. 1991, 152, fn.
4; 1991, 169] !!! WCh.: Angas gir “1. to close up, 2. jam together, so as to leave no
aperture” [Flk. 1915, 188]?
! Other etymologies for Eg. m3r are evidently out of question.
nb: (1) F. L. Grif"th (quoted by Spg. 1899, 39, §xxxiii) derived it from Eg. m3r
“drücken, pressen” (above), which was tentatively accepted by W. Spiegelberg (“das
ist gewiß möglich”!), although he hold a connection with Eg. 3r( j) “einwickeln” (above)
more probable. (2) W. M. Müller (1909, 195): < 3rj ~ 3r “to ward off, exclude” (cf.
also Spg., RT 21, 39 with exx.). (3) P. Langlois (1919 passim, esp. 155) combined
Eg.-Sem. *mi)ru (sic) with Eg. t3–mrj and many other impossible comparanda derived
ultimately from Eg. mr “to bind” (supra). Absurd. (4) L. Homburger (1930, 283):
~ Ful meddy-ude “enfermer”. (5) Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 194, #1765): ~ PSem.
*m*- “to make go away”, Eg. m3.t “stalled cattle” (!), m33b “to expel” (!), LECu.:
Afar m1*- “to choose, select, set apart”. (6) GT: a connection with LECu.: Saho
makare “to surround” [Vergari 2003, 130] (ECu. *-k- + Eg. -3–) seems also to be
excluded.
m&rj (GW) “enclosure” (LEg. hapax, Sivan & Cochavi-Rainey 1992, 82) = “Umwallung, Umschließung” (GHWb 382).
nb1: Occurs in the toponym pn-m3rj (Pap. Wilbour B3:22, perhaps also B7:20
corrupted into n3–«n3r).
nb2: Syllabic spelling: ma-sá-ra-ja (Helck) = ma-)á-ra-ya (Sivan & Cochavi
Rainey).
nb3: Cf. also m3rj (GW) “(in dem Ausdruck: jr m3rj als ein Beruf neben Konditor)”
(LEg., Wb II 189, 10) = *Umhüllung (des Gebäcks)” (GHWb 382)?
! Etymology debated. " 1. R. O. Faulkner (1952 IV, 82) surmised that it might be “perhaps identical with” the LEg. toponym pn-m33, which A. H. Gardiner (1948
m!rj 855



856
II, 42) supposed to represent the late form of old pr-m3d (AEO II 111*, cf. Wb II 191) and the direct LEg. etymon of Dem. pr-m3 “Oxyrhynchos (el-Behna/esa/e)” (DG 134:2) > Cpt. (SB) pmjh, pmje “id.” (KHW 478). " 2. Other supposed it to have been borrowed from Can., but the source is uncertain. W. Helck (1971, 515, #134) identi"ed it with Hbr. m2)$r3 “Einschließung” < ))wr (for which cf. above s.v. Eg. m3r “umwallen”). D. Sivan & Z. Cochavi-Rainey (1992, 16, §1.2.2.1; 36, §2.1.3.2.4, and 37, §2.1.4.1), in turn, vacillated between explaining it from Sem. *)wr > Hbr. m3).r or m2)$r3 (so also Quack 1996, 175) or alternatively from a *ma- pre"x nomen loci of Sem. *n.r “to watch, guard”. Accordingly, they have reconstructed the LEg. form either as *ma)3r3/aya or *man)araya > *ma))araya, resp.
m&rn (GW, metal det.) “(?)” (XIX. 2x: Libyan war inscr. of Merenptah, line 61, KRI IV 9:9, also KRI IV 22:15, AC 1978, 14) = “(subst. inconnu)” (AL 78.1948) = “a weapon (?)” (Hoch).
nb: Syllabic spelling: (KRI IV 9) m-3a-ra-na2 vs. (KRI IV 22) ma4–3a-r-[. . .], vocal
ized as *ma3ar3na (?) (Hoch).
! Origin debated. In any case, it looks like a Sem. loan-word borrowed from a Can. (?) nomen instr. (but even this is dubious) signifying some sort of metal tool. " 1. J.-J. Janssen (1975, 325, fn. 72) saw in it a defective wtg. (or var. form?) of Eg. mrq3n (GW, metal det.) “metal object the nature of which is unknown, but which may be tool” (middle of XX., Ostr. DeM 434, II, 7) = “un outil” (AC 1978, 14; AL 78.1799, 79.1283) = “a metal tool” (DLE I 229). " 2. J. Hoch (1994, 178, §241), however, assumed it to be a distinct lexeme which is perhaps related to Ug. m3rn (sg.) “the weapon used by soldiers who are called mdr0glm” [Gordon 1955, 286–7, #1071a: cf. Nougayrol, Syria 25, 1953, 193, n. 1] = “a kind of weapon (for chariots): broadsword (?)” [DUL 530] the ultimate origin of which is uncertain. This term is present also in Akk. (CAD: WSem. word, i.e., < Ug.?) mazarunu “an implement” [CAD m1, 437–8]. Hoch’s a priori assumption that this “may not be Semitic” is perhaps premature.
nb1: Cf. also Ug. m3r>l “term for a military class, probably watchman, guard” [DUL
529], which, however, is explained by others from a Hurro-Akk. /ma))3r=u0l-/ with
the Hurr. nomen agentis (cf. also Goetze, JCS 1, 1947, 72; DL, WO 3, 1966, 198f.;
Djk. 1971, 78; Thiel, UF 12, 1980, 354, fn. 38). The authors of DUL (l.c.) regard
it recently “less likely” that the Ug. title denoted “soldiers who bear the m3rn”
[Gordon 1955, 287, #1071b; 1965, #1435] = “porte-m3r” [Nougayrol, Iraq 25,
m!rn



857
1963, 118, fn. 48] = “a m3r-bearer (soldier)” [Hoch] = “users of the m3rn weapon”
[Rainey quoted in DUL].
nb2: The equation of Ug. m3rn with Akk. nam)3ru “(großes) Schwert” [AHW
729] = nam)aru “1. sword, 2. (awooden stick or mace with stones af"xed to it)”
[CAD n1, 246] (Sanmartín, UF 21, 1989, 342; DUL 530) seems phonologically
equivocal. Alternatively, J. Aistleitner (quoted by Hoch l.c. who gave no reference)
associated it with Ar. 3arra “to scatter”, which for Hoch rightly “this seems unlikely
on semantic grounds”.
m&l ~ m&wl “Zwiebel” (Dem., DG 195:4; Vittmann 1996, 440) > Cpt. (SB) (e)mjwl “onion” (CD 213b; CED; DELC).

Quack (2005, 314), “die Reduktion des Vortonvokales” and the completion of the regular shift of old *ã > Cpt. -õ- point to “eine ältere Entlehnung”, which is corroborated also by the inner-Eg. change of m- < *b-.

nb1: Both Akk. and Ug. have a var. with -š (exactly with the same mng.), which
were earlier combined with Akk. 0am3šu and Ar. 0am3šu (cf. Held, Leshonenu
18, 1953, 151, n. 35). But as pointed out by M. Held (1959; WUS #1550), these
are more probably due to a “secondary phonetic modi!cation” (Held) of )m0), i.e., an
assimiliation of *-)t > -št. Nevertheless, M. Dahood (1965, 64, #1460) postulated
a separate root ()m0š) in the light of EA 252:19 (yima0ašši).
nb2: The rendering of Ug. m0)-m (pl.) has been equivocal: “Metzger (?) oder (nach
Held) Weber (?)” [Ast., WUS l.c. supra] = “members of a certain guild, perhaps
butchers” [Gordon l.c. supra] = “un corps de soldats ou de gardes” [Heltzer, UF
19, 1987, 449] = “tisseurs” [Xella 1990, 471].
nb3: For the problem of the Aram. re#exes cf. Held 1959, 171, fn. 38 (with lit.) and
the entry for Eg. m0j “durchstoßen” (GR, Wb, above with further disc. and lit.).
nb4: Ar. m0* is problematic semantically, but acceptable phonologically as rightly
stated by M. Held (1959, 171 & fn. 43–44), who argued against a direct association
of the mng. “to churn (milk)” with Sem. *m0¿ “to strike”. He maintains that its
other mngs. (“to be taken with the pains of parturition” and “to shake” in general)
indicate no semantic relation either with Sem. *m0¿ “to strike”, since “the process of
churning milk does not involve beating but rather shaking”. This latter use of the Ar. root he
combined with Akk. mâ)u (*mw)?) “buttern” [AHW 621] = “to churn” [CAD m1,
350], which is certainly false, cf. rather Ug. my) “Melker (?)” [AHW] ! Yemeni Ar.
mw¿: I m3¿ “to milk, make thick milk, churn butter” [Piamenta 1990, 474].
nb5: J. Aistleitner (1948, 212, §6; WUS #1639) and F. Renfroe (1992, 130–2) af"li
ated the Sem. root with the basic sense “to hit etc.” (above) also with Ug. m)0
“austoßen” [Ast.] = “(aneinander) stoßen” [WUS] = “to pull” [DUL 586] and Ar.
m)0 “wegstoßen” [WUS]. As pointed out by Renfroe, the Ug. root was used to
describe a struggle like like lsmm (obscure), while the Ar. one principally signi"es
“the characteristic con"guration of concentric sheaths or layers possessed by certain
plants”, cf. Ar. mu))30- “a plant which has layers like onion”, "um)$0-at- “such
a layer or sheath”, whence the verbal signi"cations, e.g., Ar. m)0 I “to pull away,
remove (a sheath, coat, layer)”, I, V, VIII “to peel, snatch off a thing from another

861
thing, remove sg. from around sg. else” [Lane 2718] are, in Renfroe’s view, of
denominative origin, while the same does not "t Ug. m)0Awhich Renfroe regarded
as cognate rather to Ug. m0) (above).
nb6: Whether Sem. * m0¿ “to weave” is ultimately related (as suggested e.g. in Held
1959, 175–6) is highly dubious. In any case, noteworthy is its parallelism with Eg.
m3% “Kopfbinde” (OK, Wb, above). D. Bidoli (1976, 32–33, fn. 10) tried to explain
the etymological connection of both Eg. roots in another way. He tentatively ren
dered the Eg. title m3% “der würdenverleihende Meister” arguing that “eine Weihe
oder Würdenverleihung bestand in einer zweifachen Umbindung” (cf. CT V 158a-d: “Seht
mich an, wie ich gegürtet bin [m3%-kwj] mit dem m3%-Gürtel, wie ich gebunden bin mit der
«fn-Binde . . .”), which led him to assuming that “möglicherweise bedeutet m3% wörtlich
‘der Umwundene’ (Zimmerer)”. This assumption and the double det. (Binde + Beil) of
m3% in Urk. I 253:18, however, can hardly be regarded as convincing etymologi
cal evidence.
nb7: H. Möller (1911, 156) derived Aram. m%« > m%" “schlagen” and Geez ma%a)a
from a biconsonantal Sem. *m%- based on their comparison with Hbr. m%q “zer
schlagen”, Ar. ma%ik- “rixator” and ma%aza “pugno percussit”.
nb8: A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973) erroneously derived Kafa maæ- (above) from PCu.
*mA*A[%]- “/-)*., /01)*.” [Dlg.] which he reconstructed on the basis of ES
(explained by him as borrowed from Cu.): Tigre /maæi%a/ “-%/%-)*.” [Dlg. pace
LH], hence re-borrowed into NAgaw: Bilin maæeh- “aus-, wegreißen, -putzen” [Rn.
1887, 265] = “abhäuten” [Rn. 1902, 287] = “-%/%-)*., '!/-)*., -%83'*3*.,
'":*. 2!5< !83'*3*. 9&!(% !* 2!5</%” [Dlg.] !! LECu.: Somali mu*a%- “ablegen,

Dlg.] (Cu.-Om.: Rn. 1887, 265; Dlg. 1973, 307–308). All these comparanda seem,
however, to have stem from Sem., cf. also Ar. ma)a0a I “1. tirer, extraire une chose”
vs. ma0a)a II “enlever, ôter qqch. de dessus, de manière à puri"er” [BK II 1067,
1115]. In addition, Dolgopol’skij compared the Cu.-Om. root also Sem. *b¿« “to
tear or break apart”, which has been rejected by G. Takács (1999, 53).
nb9: Probably no connection to WBrb.: Zng. )m-* ~ )n-* “1. plier, 2. mettre en
oeuvre, traiter, 3. forger” > a-n2-mu* “artisan, forgeron” [Ncl. 1953, 206].
nb10: V. Orel & O. Stolbova (HSED 385, #1779) compared Som. mu*a%- with
CCh.: Gsg. mo* “to tear” which they erroneously explained from an alleged AA
*moda9- (sic) “to tear”. But he failed to demonstrate the case of Hausa -r- < *-*- on
the basis of an extensive etymological evidence.
nb11: P. Newman (1970, 42) assumed Angas )mw-t (above) to be etymologically
related to WCh.: Hausa mààráá “to slap” [Abr. 1962, 655] and derived the C2 in
both cases from PWCh. *-*-.
nb12: A. Drexel (1925, 7) supposed a pre"x m- in Akk. m0) “schlagen” (baseless)
which he af"liated with WCh.: Hausa kácà (-ts-) “zerreißen, sprengen, brechen”
[Drexel] = “1. to scrape off, 2. plane wood, 3. snap (thread, rope), 4. pluck (fruit),
5. tog up etc. “ [Abr. 1962, 504] (semantically unconvincing).
! Other etymologies are out of question.
nb: (1) W. F. Albright (1918, 233, #52), followed by F. von Calice (1936, #644)
equated it with Hbr. %)b “to hew (wood, stone)”, Ar. %)m “to break wind”. cf. also
Akk. 0)b “to cut” [Alb.] = “abbrechen” [AHW 331]. (2) E. Zyhlarz (1934, 111)
compared Eg. m3% with SBrb.: Ahaggar a-mr2h “Handsäge, Sichel”. The two
words have nothing to do with one other: Eg. -3– + Brb. *-r-, while Ahaggar -h
re#ects PSBrb. *-z in this case (cf. Eg. m3z, above). (3) L. Homburger (1930, 285):
~ Ful lahal, la"al “écuelle en bois”, law-de “travailler de bois”. Absurd just like
(4) A. M. Lam’s (1993, 385) etymology: Ful ma''a “grande hache à large tranchant
pour le gros bois”.

nb1: The OK term only occurs in the expression Gz m3% “den Gürtel umbinden”
“mannbar werden” (Wb, so also Staehelin) = “nouer le bandeau” - “devenir élève”
(Grdseloff, ASAE 42, 1943, 118f.) = “to bind on the girdle” - “to attain puberty”
(Lambdin) = “an expression for reaching manhood” (Kerrn 1961, 93–95) = “eine
Art Reifezeremonie: das Knoten und Umlegen einer Kopfbinde zum Zeitpunkt
der Reife und der Verantwortungsfähigkeit (nicht das Anlegen des Galaschurzes)”
(Feucht 1995, 238–245), which was – according to Kaplony (KBIÄF 134–5, n. 111)
– in fact “eine schon im A.R. nicht mehr geübte Sitte”. The OK and MK terms derive from
the same root and both are supposed to represent even the same word (cf. Gunn,
JEA 25, 1939, 218; Kerrn 1961, 93–95), which may have had – in the view of Stae
helin (1966, 29) – the primary sense “eines einfachen Zugstreifen, d.h. im M.R. um die Taille,
im A.R. um den Kopf gelegt”. Goedicke (1967 KDAR, 69) rendered its occurence in PT
1214bPM as “Stirnband”. Although Staehelin (l.c.) "rmly disproved the rendering of
OK tz m3% as “eine Kopfbinde knüpfen”, and Feucht (1995, 242) also found the
argument prima vista attractive that “mit der Reife setzt das Schamgefühl ein, so daß sich
das Kind . . . beginnt zu verhüllen”, the latter author has nevertheless excluded “daß ein so
wichtiges . . . Handlungselement . . . sich von einem Schurz zu einer Kopfbinde verändert hat”. The
MK mng. “Kopfbinde” is reaf"rmed also in the Sign Pap. of Tanis (cf. Grif"th &
Petrie 1889, pl. 6, 26; Staehelin 1966, 26).
nb2: Kaplony (IÄF 327, 475f.) suggested an archaic var. b3% (as PN) “Kopfbinde”,
which seems rather uncertain and has been rightly declined by Staehelin (1966, 25,
fn. 5). For the problem of reading m3% in Pap. Westcar 7:4–5 and 8:25–9:1 cf. Eyre
1992, 281, fn. 14.
nb3: The assumption that old m3% is re#ected by Dem. m34 “Gürtel” (DG 195) >
Cpt. (S) majH, motjH, mojH, moujH, (A) majG, (B) mojJ, moujJ, moJj “gir
dle of soldier or monk” (CD 213b) = “Gürtel” (KHW 114) has been abandoned
already in the Wb II 189. Still, Staehelin (1966, 29) speaks of a late word “bewahrt in
der volkssprachlichen Traditon”. The Dem.-Cpt. form point to an etymon *m34, while
Erman (1892, 112) preferred to side with reconstructing *m30. The fact, that the
derivation of Dem.-Cpt. m34 from old m3% is not accepted in the Wb II 189, did not
hinder Vergote (1950, 292) in thinking that the reasons thereof “ne sont peut-être pas un
argument décisif ”. Moreover, W. Westendorf (KHW 114 & fn. 4) erroneously assumed
that the connection to old m3% “setzt einen Übergang % > 4 voraus”, which he – rather
illogically – compared to “den Wechsel von 0 zu % in der Umgebung von m” (mentioned
by Fecht, ZÄS 92, 1967, 26, fn. 2). W. Vycichl (DELC 132–3) misquoted the Dem.
word as m3% (sic). Lambdin (1953, 152) and Quack (2005, 314 and fn. 12) set up an
old *må3% on the basis of the Cpt. (!) evidence (with the Lautverschiebung of old *å
m!"



> o), albeit Quack too rejected the derivation from old m3% (contra DELC 132–3).
More realistic is – provided we keep maintaining that Dem. m34 has nothing to do
with OK m3% – to suggest that the Cpt. forms are due to a change of old *må3'%
~ *mã3'%.
! Hence (denom.): m3% “den Kopf umwinden mit einer Binde, mit einem Diadem, mit einem Kranz” (XVIII., Wb II 190, 2–4; GHWb 382; ÄWb II 1172: already CT V 158a) = “to invest with insignia” (FD 124) = “(urspr.) umgürten, (speziell) umbinden mit der Kopfbinde” (Bidoli 1976, 33, fn. 10) = “to be invested (with insignia)” (DCT 195). ! AA origin uncertain. Most promising seems #3. " 1. Usually identi"ed with Hbr. m1za% “1. Gürtel, 2. Damm, Deich” (cf. also *m2z5a% “Gürtel oder Damm”) [GB 411] = “waistband (always worn directly next to the skin)” (cf. also *m3zia% “belt, waistband”) [ KB 565] = “girdle” [ Ember] = “ceinture” [ Lexa]. Later, Hbr. m1za% and Eg. m3% were also equated with Akk. (LBab.) m1ze/ a0u ~ m3za0u “Schärpe (von Gottesbildern)” [AHW 650] = (NBab.) m1ze/a0u ~ m3za0u “a scarf or belt” [CAD m2, 46] = m1za0 (sic) “belt, waist-band” [ KB 565]. The suggested etymological connection of the Eg.-Hbr.-Akk. parallel full of controversies. At any rate, the cognacy of Eg. m3% with Akk. m1za0- or Hbr. m1za% is excluded (Eg. -3- + Sem. *-z- or *-3-). At the present moment, it is dif"cult to form a de"nite judgement on this matter. One may only underline some circumstances for orientation (discussed below), which suggest that probably there was no relationship at all.
lit. for Eg.-Sem.: Erman 1892, 112; Ember 1911, 90, 92; 1930, #10.a.22, #14.a.7;
Stricker 1937, 18; Lexa 1938, 222; Lambdin 1953, 152; Staehelin 1966, 26 & fn. 3;
Conti 1976, 267, fn. 18; KHW 114; MM 1983, 177, fn. 4.
nb1: The Hbr. word is attested three times in the OT, but in the view of Lambdin
(1953, 152), only one of these occurences can be certainly rendered as “girdle”. Stae
helin (l.c.) mentions even a Hbr. var. m2d5a% (sic, with -d-) “Gürtel”, which is in fact
a false transcription of the unattested *m2z5a%.
nb2: It is clear that – for phonological reasons – Hbr. m1za% cannot be a genetically
inherited cognate of Eg. m3% as rightly stated already by Vycichl (DELC 133): “le
correspondance [ Hbr.] z : [ Eg.] 3 ne vau que pour les mots d’emprunt ”, while “% : 0 n’est pas
une correspondance régulière”.
nb3: In theory, the Hbr. word might be late a borrowing from OEg. m3% (provided
we discard deriving Dem. m34 and the Cpt. re#exes from it) as it has been suggested
by a number of authors (Bondi 1894, 132; Erman 1892, 112; Clc. 1936, #643;
Lambdin 1953, 152; Staehelin 1966, 26 & fn. 3; Castellino 1984, 15). Indeed, Eg.
3 > Can./Hbr. z is possible, cf., e.g., Eg. 3r.t “hand” (OK) > (?) Ug. 3r-t [Dahood
1965, 7f. contra DUL 289], OHbr. zeret “Spanne” [GB] = “span of the hand (as a
measure)” [KB], Syr. zart3 ~ zirt3 [KB] etc. (Can.-Eg.: GB 208; KB 283). W. M.
Müller (1905, 362, fn. 1) too supposed a Hbr. < Eg. borrowing trying to explain the
sound changes another way: “nicht klar ist ms% (sic, probably for m)%) ‘Gürtel’ = h.
mz%, bei denen ägyptischer Ursprung nahe liegt” arguing that “in mz% könnte man das m auf
) einwirkend denken”. B. Gunn ( JEA 25, 1939, 218f.), in turn, correctly opposed the
m!" 863



identi"cation of the Hbr. term as an Eg. loan, since (1) Eg. m3% is wrongly tanslated
“girdle” (instead of “"llet”), while (2) Eg. -3- > late -d- + Hbr. -z-, and also because
(3) the Hbr. form has Sem. background (below). The latter argument has been reaf
"rmed by Vergote (1950, 292): “le mot m1za% cité par Spiegelberg pourrait aussi !gurer parmi
les mots hébreux”. Muchiki (1999, 248–9) also maintained that Hbr. term could not be
a loan from Eg. m3%.
nb4: The fact, that the Hbr. form has alleged Sem. cognates (below), led ,erný
(CED 101) and Muchiki (1999, 248–9) to treat Dem. m34 and Cpt. (B) mojJ etc.
(separately from OEg. m3%, cf. above) as late loan from Sem. But this LEg. < Sem.
borrowing suggested in CED 101 is impossible for the signi"cant anomalies of vocal
ization (LEg. *m!30 + Akk. m1za0- or Hbr. m1za%).
nb5: Searching for the further inner Sem. connections for Hbr. m1za%, most authors
in the lit. (GB 411; Ember 1911, 92; 1930, #14.a.7; Gunn, JEA 25, 1939, 218f.; KB
565) have suggested or preferred a derivation from Sem. *)%zm “girdle” [Gunn pace
Driver] (the most widespread etymology), cf. OSA (Minaean) %zm “Gürtel” [GB]
= “strapped” [Driver quoted by Gunn], Ar. %azama I “entourer et serrer avec des
cordes, faire des ballots, emballer”, %iz3m- “1. sangle (d’une bête de somme, d’une
monture), 2. langes (d’enfant), 3. (Eg. dial.) ceinture en soie rayée en trois lés, avec
franges” [BK I 420–1] = %azama “festbinden, die Gurten anziehen” [Clc.]. At any
rate, G. R. Driver’s (apud Gunn) PSem. *mz% is baseless, while his Ar. 0azama (sic,
with 0-) is simply erroneous. Though a metathesis in Hbr. m1za% is not impossible,
Calice (1936, #643) called this Hbr.-Ar. comparison as problematic (a comparison
of Sem. *%zm ~ Eg. m3% seems even less convincing). At the same time, Vycichl
(1934, 43; 1936, 109; 1939, 141), followed by Zaborski (1971, #227) and Belova
(1993, 43, #216, 45, #267), considered the initial %- to be a root complement, deriv
ing Ar. %azama from a biconsonantal *)zm > Ar. zamma I “1. lier, serrer etc.” [BK

Hbr. m1za% cf. GB 411. Recently, D. Testen (kind p.c., 28 February 1998) postulates
that Hbr. m1za% goes back to *miz%- or *miz0-, i.e., that the *m was an original radi
cal of the triconsonantal root rather than an af"x in it. This makes it hard to relate
it to Akk. m1za0u (the instrumental noun to the verb ez10u, cf. below). In addi
tion, Testen found it dif"cult to separate the Hbr. word from Ar. mis%- (pl. "ams3%-,
mus$%-) “2. feutre épais que l’on met sous la selle et immédiatement sur le dos d’une
bête de somme” [BK II 1103] = “a garment of thick, or coarse, hair-cloth, a piece of
such stuff as is spread in a house or tent, an old and worn-out garment” [ Lane 2714]
= “hair shirt” [Testen], which he suspects to result from devoicing of *-z- by a fol
lowing -%. If this is correct, so ponders Testen, either the Akk. form (with -0-) or the
Ar. form (with -%-) is a loanword from NWSem. If not, then both. It seemed best for
Testen to reconstruct an early NWSem. *miz%-, which might well be a loan, possibly
from Eg. m3%. This might well be in principle true if the OK-MK term is unrelated
to Dem. m34 and its Cpt. counterpart (re#ecting a different vocalism). R. M. Voigt
(p.c., 22 July 2007) still maintains that “die Verknüpfung von hebräisch m1za% mit dem
akkadischen Wort der Wurzel ez10u ist evident”. Militarev (MM 1983, 177, fn. 4) errone
ously combined the Akk.-Hbr. parallel also with Akk. (NAss.) maz3"u (mez3"u?) “ein
Ledergegenstand” [AHW 637] = “a leather object” [CAD m2, 438], which seems
rather unconvincing both phonologically and semantically. Besides, the Hbr. term
(in its 2nd mng.) has been combined by Landberg (quoted in GB) with Dathina m3si%
“palissade de branchage” [GD 2694] = “Damm” [GB 411].
nb6: As noted in AHW 269 & 650 and CAD l.c., Akk. m1za0- (treated in GB 411
mistakenly as a “Fremdwort”) derives (via pre"x *ma-) from O/LBab. )jz0: ez10u
“gürten” [AHW 269] = “to gird” [CAD e 426]. Thus, the LBab. noun goes back
to *ma-jza0-, i.e., a nomen instr. of the ma-pras- pattern. As rightly suggested already
by Lambdin (1953, 152), one has to point to the substantially different vocalization
864 m!"



of Hbr. m1za% < *miz%- (?) vs. Akk. m1za0u < *ma-jza0- vs. Eg. *må3% < *mag%
/*maç%- (or sim.?) [GT]. Similarly, J. F. Quack (2005, 314): “im Vergleich mit akk.
m1ze0u”, in Hbr. “*m1zia% ist die Vokalstruktur verändert”, which also speaks against an
Eg. > Hbr. borrowing. Naturally, all these facts certainly exclude that (1) the source
of the Akk. term was the poorly documented OT Hbr. m1za% (if there was any con
nection at all, it may have only been not vice versa, i.e., an Akk. > Hbr. borrowing),
and (2) that – as Vycichl (1983, 133) rightly emphasized – the false Akk.-Hbr. parallel
cannot be cognate to Eg. m3% as the only regular correspondence is the initial m
(Eg. % + Sem./Akk. *0). Note that Staehelin (1966, 26 & fn. 3) mistakenly surmised
in the Akk. term a borrowing from Eg.
nb7: If there was any connection, the only question can be: who borrowed from
whom? LEg. *m34 or *m30 could indeed have been borrowed from LBab. m1za0u.
But OEg. m3% cannot have come either from a LBab. or Can./OT source. LBab.
m1za0u cannot be a Can. or Eg. loan either as it originates from the Akk. root
)jz0. In theory, Hbr. m1za% could have been borrowed from Akk. m1za0u, but not
from Eg. *må3%. A cognacy between Akk. m1za0u vs. Eg. m3% is excluded. Besides,
PSem. *-0 ~ OEg. -% is impossible (though, in principle, a change *-30 > -3% under
the in#uence of -3- should not be ruled out). It would be just as well baseless to sup
pose in OEg. m3% a very early loan-word from a Sem. word akin to Hbr. m1za%,
since the data at hand are insuf"cient to set up a PSem. reconstruction. All in all, the
coincidence of the Eg., Akk., Hbr. forms is probably misleading that no safe com
parison can be based on.
" 2. H. Abel (1933–34, 304) and E. Zyhlarz (1934–35, 175) found an areal parallel of Eg. m3% in Nub.: Kunuzi am3 ̧i “Gürtel”, ama ̧1
“sich gürten”. " 3. C. T. Hodge (1966, 45, #34) identi"ed Eg. m3% with WCh.: Hausa máácè “to "rmly wind on (turban)” [Abr. 1962, 668]. Semantically good, phonologically problematic (PAA *-%- vs. Hausa zero is problematic). According to Stolbova (1987, 89, t. 2.7), WCh. *-%- yielded Hausa -g-. For the Hausa root cf. rather Eg. m3.t “hobble for cattle” (Grd. 1927, 508–9, discussed above). " 4. H. Goedicke (1967 KDAR, 69), in turn, supposed in Eg. m3% an m- pre"x derivative of Eg. 3%(3) signifying “eine spezielle Art von Personen” and also “Männer, die eng mit dem Königshof verbunden sind”, whereby Goedicke deduced that “diese Männer sind jung” and that the underlying basic sense was perhaps “Jungmann”. Even less convincing is his idea that Eg. w3% “ein Kind entwöhnen” (Wb I 409, 14) is “vermutlich” also related. Naturally, as Goedicke rightly noted, “ein Zusammenhang mit dem Ortsnamen z3-3%w ( Junker: Giza III 181) ist unsicher”. Neither of Goedicke’s etymologies can be accepted, since even if we a priori assume Eg. m3% to be a nomen instr., one might expect a quite different primary sense of its verbal root. " 5. W. Vycichl (1983 DELC, 133) suggests that Eg. m3% is eventually equivalent with Hbr. m1)a% “Stirn” (cf. *mi)%3, st.cstr. mi)%at“Beinschiene, gleichs. die Stirn des Beines”) [GB 453] = “brow” [ KB
m!" 865



623]. Attractive, but uncertain, as the etymology of the Hbr. term is highly disputed.
nb: The lexicographers surveyed in GB 453 left it without comment. W. Leslau
(1945, 242) combined the Hbr. word for “forehead” with MSA: Jbl. (Shahri) "z%ait
“forehead” [ Lsl.] (which has been, surprisingly, ignored in KB), while Guillaume
(quoted in KB 623) explained it from Ar. w*% “to be bright”.
" 6. A. Ju. Militarev (MM 1983, 177, fn. 4) extended the comparison of Eg. m3% vs. Akk. m1za0u to LECu.: Somali máy*á% “inner bark of trees used for rope-making” < mu*%-in-ayya “1. to strip off (the leaves), 2. undress, 3. (thief) despoil s’one” [Abr. 1964, 177, 182] = mú*a%- “abhäuten, abbalgen” [ Rn. 1902, 287]. The Eg.-Somali equation could be phonologically correct, but semantically it is clearly untenable. The suggested Akk.-Somali etymology evidently is out of question.
nb: A. B. Dolgopol’skij (1973, 307) derived the Som. root from his PCu.-Om.
*mAHA[%]- “/-)*., /01)*.” (based in fact on a Som.-Kaffa comparison), for which
cf. rather Eg. m3% “(Holz) behauen, (Schiffe) zimmern” (Lit. MK, Wb, above).
" 7. Ch. Ehret (1997 MS, 193, #1764) regarded its -% as a root extension and combined it with Ar. m** “to wrap up the head”, Eg. m3.wt “bonds”, m33.t “papyrus roll” (!), and Cu. *maÁ- (*-dl-) “to roll,
twist”. Incorrect.
nb: Naturally, Eg. m33.t (from *m-gl.t ~ Sem. *gll > Hbr. m2gill3 < AA *g-l, above)
is unrelated.
" 8. GT: noteworthy is the striking parallelism between Eg. m3% “to hew” ~ Sem. *m%/0.÷ “to hit” (cf. above) and Eg. m3% “(orig.) to bind, tie around (?)” ~ Sem. *m%/0.÷ “to weave”, the ultimate origin of both Sem. roots being supposed to be the same.
nb1: The latter Sem. root is attested in Akk. ma03)u [irreg. -0- < *-%-?] “2. weben”

nb2: That the root is attested also in Akk. ma03)u “weben” [AHW 580] !! MSA: Sqt.
mé%a* “tisser” [Lsl. 1938, 240] proves that Common Aram. m%" “to weave” is due
to a dissimilation of an earlier *m%« and can only derive from Sem. *m0¿/.÷ (Aram.
« < old *q being a regular re#ex of Sem. *¿/.÷).
nb3: Traditionally (Landsberger 1912, 130, §2; Lsl. 1944, 56; Held 1959, 175–6;
AHW 580), the basic sense of this Sem. root has been explained from that of the
homophonous root meaning “to hit” (e.g., J. Levy l.c.: “eig. wohl: die Fäden übereinander
schlagen oder mit dem Webeschiffchen anschlagen”, L. Kogan, p.c. on 26 Dec. 2006: it “must
be somehow connected with the basic meaning ‘to strike’ even if the semantic shifts implied are not yet

properly understood”). Although Sqt. -%- does not decide the question of the PSem. C2
(as Sqt. -%- < *-0- is also possible, cf. SED I lxix), the supposed semantic history (“to
weave” < “to hit”) suggests that all re#exes are ultimately to be derived from Sem.
*m0¿/.÷ “to hit, shoot” [Lsl.].
" 9. GT: alternatively, we might derive it from an AA *m-ç/æ/*-%
re#ected by (possibly without trace of the C3) HECu.: Sid. mi9-e (f )
“belt, girdle, especially used by children” [Gsp. 1983, 235].
nb: The etymology of CCh.: Mafa mózokw “ceinture de "bre rouge à laquelle sont
suspendus d’autres "bres, cache-sexe en "bre rouge” [Brt.-Bléis 1990, 236] is fully
obscure. At any rate, there seems to be no correspondence between Mafa -z- and
Sid. -9-, let alone the anomaly of Mafa -kw vs. Eg. -%.
" 10. GT: if, in turn, we assume an AA etymon *m-g-%, cp. WCh.: PAngas *muk ~/> *mwak [AS *-k# < AA *-g reg.] “to gird up loincloth” [GT 2004, 254]: Angas yem mwak “a grass used as dress by women instead of leaves” (cf.

! Mng. and etymology obscure. " 1. D. Meeks (AL 77.1836) explained it from an OK name of oil read as m%d.t (early Dyn. III & Dyn. V, cf. Altenmüller & Moussa 1977, 107, no. 21), which “pourrait être la forme ancienne de md%tj”. B. Koura (1999, 189), however, thinks that there is “kein Beiweis für die Behauptung Meeks”. Elsewhere, in the same work, Koura (1999, 125) labelled Meeks’ idea only as “nicht zweifelsfrei”.
nb: The rendering of the OK term for oil is debated. H. Balcz (1934, 77) assumed
it to be “vielleicht . . . mit dem späteren m3.t identisch” (approved also by H. Altenmül
ler, quoted by Koura 1999, 124–5), which is certainly out of question (due to -%-).
m!".t – m!".tj 867



P. Kaplony (IÄF I 308), in turn, read it m%-jb-3.t “Öl, welches das Herz der Götter
(?) füllt”, which is hardly more than pure speculation. B. Koura (1998, 71) assumed
in m%3.t a compound of m% “füllen” + 3.t “Leib” < (sic!) m3.t (q.v.): “zusammen mit
dem Wort m% für “füllen” ergibt sich ein sinnvoller Kontext, so daß m3t zu (m%)-m-3t ergänzt
werden kann in der Bedeutung ‘das Füllen mit dem, was sich in dem Körper befand ’ ”. Dif"cult
to follow.
" 2. On the other hand, in the light of Eg. m3%-mrw “Gefäßaufschrift: aus dem Behauen des mrw-Holzes gewonnene Öl” (Dyn. 0–III) and m3% “die Ölverarbeitung (im Goldhaus)” (early Dynastic), B. Koura (1999, 255) wondered – with right hesitation (“kann nicht festgestellt werden”) – whether LP m3%.tj derived directly from Eg. m3% “Holz behauen” or from a nisba (!) of the Berufsbezeichnung m3%.w “Zimmermann, Meister”, which would, however, require a more profound demonstration.

Cochavi-Rainey (1992 l.c. infra). In addition, as rightly pointed out by W. A. Ward (1996, 28, #171), the “Sem. cognates have to do with casting metal”. This made Ward regard the usual derivation of our word from Sem. as improbable and assume that “this is rather a native Eg. term appearing in a list ” that “has many similar statements where the Eg. term is given”.

Attested also as an arti"cial word in the Sign Pap. of Tanis (26): mdd (wood det.) “als Name des Schriftzeichens” (LP, Wb II 191, 13, cf. Peterson 1963, 85, fn. 3).
nb1: The sign was read by P. Lacau (1954, 79) as m3r, which was "rst suggested
by K. Sethe (1892, 55–56) for the verbal root m3d (below) assuming an erosion of
original m3r into m3, which would have been extended by an additional third root
consonant -d in the MK (on the analogy of the alleged derivation of Eg. š«j > š«d “to
cut”). For the problem cf. the following lexicon entry.
nb2: A. Badawy (l.c.) explained the hrgl. from the verbal root m3d (below), cf. m3d
nb3.t rendered by him as “an action of setting the posts in a line, using the stretched
cord”.
nb3: Although the hrgl. m3d “dem šzm-Zeichen sehr ähnlich ist (vgl. Šzm.w, der Gott der
Wein- und Ölpresse, dessen Wortzeichen zeigt eine Kelter)” (Peterson 1963, 85) that depicts “la
presse à sac (un ligne tendu entre deux piquets que l’on tord pour presser le raisin” and
thus šzm was often confused with mdd from the 1st IMP (Baud 1998, 24). However,
M. Baud (1998, 19, fn. 22) warns that “. . . il n’y a pas lieu de confondre avec le signe m3d, du
moins avant le Moyen Empire” (cf. also Moret 1907, 78) with respect to “l’emploi de m3d
pour le rassemblement des os du roi au Pyr. 530a, alors que c’est j«b qui est généralement employé”.
! P. Wilson (PL 485–6) explained it from the primary signi"cation of the Eg. verbal root mdd that she conceived as “to be (held) straight, strong”. In her view, the hrgl. Aa23 used for writing this root was “referring to the fact that in the determinative the warp-(thread) is held tightly and stright”. GT: since Eg. m3d can originate (i.a.) in an earlier *mgd, the coincidence with Sem.: PBHbr. m3g.d “Ausbreiter (Holzstange?)” [Dalman 1922, 223] = “ein Gegenstand, worüber etwas gezogen, ausgedehnt wird, wie z.B. ein Pfahl, auf welchem die Wäsche behufs Trocknens ausgebreitet wird” [Levy 1924 III, 12] = “a frame to spread clothes on” [ Jastrow 1950, 726] seems noteworthy, although its verbal root ()ngd) is apparently incompatible with the initial m- of Eg. m3d.

Cf. also m3d 2b.w “die Fußsohle folgen” (ZÄS 111, 1984, 136; WD I 100).
nb1: From the instances written as m3d, m«3, m3, H. Brugsch (1868, 23) errone
ously set up an Urwurzel *m3 (rendered as “offnen, aufmachen”). Whether the origi
nal root is to be read in fcat as *m3r had been long debated. K. Sethe (1892, 55–56)
872 m!d



listed two alleged exx. of MK m3d w3.t n.t (or m2n) written with "nal -r, whereby he
reconstructed the primary verbal root as m3r (!) assuming that the "nal consonant of
the original m3r was lost and the biconsonantal *m3 was then enlarged by an addi
tional third root consonant -d in the MK (false, since -d is already attested in the OK)
on the analogy of the alleged derivation of Eg. š«j > š«d “to cut” (cf. also Sethe 1899
I, §361). W. M. Müller (1909, 190) too surmised (falsely) an original (*)m3r (m)r)
“to press” and a secondary derivative m3d (m)d), but he declined Sethe’s “desperate
explanation” outlined above. Instead, Müller found it easier to assume an original
(*)m3r and -d as a result of dissimilation of -3- (for which he erroneously cited Eg.
psš ~ pšš, which are in fact two distinct roots), i.e., that the primary root was actually
reduplicated into *m3[{]d[{] < *m3[{]3[{], which is baseless. Even recently, G. R.
Castellino (1984, 12) maintains the change -r > -d in Eg. m3r > later m3d, which
is a mistake since the consonants of the root have long been safely identi"ed. The
right doubt as to the rdg. *m3r has already been expressed by Moret 1907, 78, fn. 1
(“la lecture mâzer [sic] . . . ne me semble pas solidement établie”). Note that OK m3r (written
without the logogram Aa23) “(den Weg jemandes) drücken” (PT 1022d, ÜKAPT VI
136) = “pressen, drücken” (PT 1022d, ÄWb I 580) is to be treated as an etymologi
cally distinct root (above).
nb2: A. Badawy (1956–57, 55) explained basic sense of the verbal root in accordance
with the “word-sign” of Eg. m3d (Aa23) showing “two forking posts about which
a cord is stretched”. P. Wilson (PL 486) too tried to understand the original sense
of the verbal root (given by her as “to be (held) straight, strong”) in the light of the
hrgl. Aa23 used for writing this root conceived by her as “a warp stretched between
two uprights (a weaving term, implies sg. held tight and straight with a measure of
force)”, which, in her view, was “referring to the fact that in the determinative the warp-(thread)
is held tightly and stright”. Naturally, the object depicted by the hrgl. Aa23 may be
presumably somehow connected with the basic notion carried by Eg. )m3d. Since,
however, a common agreement has not yet been achieved as for the “decipherment”
of the sign, it would be risky to build far-reaching theories on this.
nb3: The same (?) verbal root may occur also in the Eg. TN pr-m3d > Cpt. (SB)
pmjh, pmje “Oxyrhynchos”, whose lit. signi"cation is uncetain. Perhaps “Haus des
Bedrückers (?)” (KHW 478 pace Helck)?
! Hence, i.a.: (1) r m3d.w n jb n “gemäß dem Wunsche des . . .” (MK, Wb II 192, 12; GHWb 383). (2) m3d (in: m3d pw jr.t nb.t) “Verzahnung (in: ‘das ist die Verzahnung alles Tuns’)” (Merikare 123, Otto, LÄ II 37) = “Ineinandergreifen (in: ‘das ist das Ineinandergreifen allen Tuns’)” (Otto 1954 ÄMÖR II 66). (3) m3d.t “compress” (Med. hapax: Pap. E.Smith 5:4, Breasted 1930, 223: Wreszinski’s 1909, 179 rdg. is dubious). (4) m3d (divine name, BD 17) “He who hits a mark” (Piankoff 1955, 58) = “oppressore” (Rachewiltz 1958, 29) = “smiter” (Allen 1960, 90, 95 contra Peterson 1963, 87, fn. 1: “nicht so gut geeignet”) = “(allem Anschein nach) ein Beiwort, Bainame des Šzm.w (der Gott der Weinund Ölpresse, ein Keltergott, dessen Wortzeichen zeigt eine Kelter), der auf seine Strafausübung in Eigenschaft als Auspresser anspielt (wenn die in Strafe Verfallenen zum zusammenpressen verwendet

nb: E. Amélineau’s (1910, 37) rendering of BD 17 m3d as “Mélangeur” (in compari
son with Cpt. mojt “to mix”, for which cf. m2k above) has been rightly rejected by
K. Sethe (1892, 55f.).
! Basic sense disputed. One of the most dif"cult Eg. roots from the viewpoint of etymology. " 1. GT: in principle, Eg. m3d might stem from AA *m-ç-d that might be reconstructed as an ancient triconsonantal var. (extended with *-d) to AA *m-ç “1. to press out, 2. suck” [GT]. Probably F. Hommel (1883, 440, fn. 30) was the "rst to observe the connection between Eg. m3d (cited by him as “me9 ‘pressen’ ”, sic) and Sem. *m)) (quoted as “ma)”, sic). A remotely related triconsonantal match (with the same AA complement *-d) of Eg. m3d (with a more developed semantics) might be Ar. ma)ada “1. téter, sucer (p.ex. le sein de sa mère, se de l’enfant), 3. cohabiter avec une femme” [BK II 1115] = “to kiss and suck (her) breast in a certain manner, suck saliva from (her) mouth” [Lane 2718] = “to press, be oppressive” [Müller] = ma)ada “to suck the breast” [KB], which can only be explained from a basic sense “to press” (cf. also below). This Eg.-Ar. match has been observed already by W. M. Müller (1909, 190, fn. 1), although he viewed that the Ar. root “coincides only accidentally” with Eg. m3d (he did not disclose whether his reservation was of semantical nature). Cf. also Ar. ma)ata “1. presser la plaie pour en faire sortir le pus, 2. cohabiter avec une femme” [BK II 1114].
nb1: The authors of KB combined the Ar. verbal root )m)d with Ar. ma)d-/ma)3d
“mountain peak, place of refuge” [KB], but failed to semantically justify this con
nection.

W. M. Müller (1909, 190, fn. 1) too accepted the equation of Eg. m3d and Hbr. my)
but declined that of Eg. m3d and Hbr. m)w, Ar. m)w, and Sem. *m)) “to suck” (that
– to quote him – “do not belong, although usually compared ”). In addition, he regarded the
coincidence of Eg. m3d with Ar. m)d “to press, be oppressive” (sic) as being due to
pure chance, although it is by far the best match offered as yet for Eg. m3d (perhaps
beside Can. *ngd and WCh.: Ngizim màg*ú below). Approaching the etymology
of our Eg. root from a Chadic perspective, C. T. Hodge (1966, 45, #34) identi
"ed Eg. m3d with WCh.: Hausa macii “being crowded”. Hodge treated Eg. -d as
a root extension added to Eg. *m3-. Note that at the same time, Hodge (1966, 45)
equated Hausa máácà “1. to squeeze out, 2. massage” with Eg. m3.t “Salbe” (above).
N. Skinner (1996, 198–9) accepted Hodge’s comparison of Eg. m3d with Hausa (and
some further AA cognates).

" 3. GT: it has to be further investigated whether the fairly signi"cant overlapping of the rather wide semantical spectrum of Sem.: Can. *ngd with that of Eg. m3d (in theory, derivable from an earlier *mgd) is due to mere chance or perhaps a common feature inherited from PAA. The semantic history and the basic sense of the ultimate (PSem.) root of Can. *ngd is not fully evident. Whether this high semantical diversity covers one common root or we are dealing with more than one roots (despite the rather “suggestive” hypothetic primary senses listed in the standard lexicons), has still to be cleared.
nb1: Cf. esp. (1) PBHbr. ngd “geißeln” [Dalman 1922, 261] vs. n2g5d (m), n2g5d3 (f )

[Levy 1924 III, 333] = n2gad “1. to stretch, draw, pull, spread, 2. lash, 3. guide,

2. provide an explanation” [KB 666] is related (e.g., via a hypothetic sense *“to pres
ent sg. prominently or meaningfully before s’one” or *“to place sg. in front of s’one,
confront s’one with sg.” as in KB?) to all (or some of) these forms is equally dubious.
nb2: For the interchange of m- ~ n- in Eg.-Sem. etymologies cf., e.g., Eg. n33
[< *ngr] “ersticken, verdursten” (MK, Wb II 377, 5–6) = “to parch with thirst” (FD
144) !!! Sem.: Ar. naCara I “9. être pris d’un violent accès de soif (hommes, animaux)”

" 4. GT: in theory, Eg. m3d (basic sense “to press”?) can be derived also from a hypothetic AA *m-g-9 > WCh.: Ngizim màg*ú “to make pelvic thrusts, as in sexual intercourse” [Schuh 1981, 108]. The data are insuf"cient.
nb: Besides, the C3 of the Ngizim root may be a root extension, cf. Ch. *mug- “to
squeeze” [GT] > WCh.: PAngas *muk “to squeeze, throttle” [GT 2004, 254]:
Angas muk “to press, squeeze” [Flk. 1915, 247] = mùk “würgen” (- Hs. šáá=è

“comprimer, presser” [Gaudiche 1938, 30].
! Other etymologies are evidently out of question: " 5. L. Reinisch (1887, 263) combined it with Ar. mz% (sic, mng. not given, NB: BK II 1099 lists no mng. comparable to those of Eg. m3d) !!! NAgaw: Bilin m¡d “auf den Kopf schlagen, den Kopf blutig schlagen jemdm.” [Rn.] !! LECu.: Orm. mad3 “wound” [Gragg 1982, 273]. But Eg. -3- + AA *-μ / ̧-.
" 6. K. Sethe (1899 I, §361) divided it into pre"x m- + *)3r " *m3r " *m3j " *m3 " m3d explaining its Grundbedeutung “(zusammen) pressen” ultimately from Eg. *3r (phon. value of the hrgl. depicting) “bundle of green stems or #ax” (EG 1927, 473), which already E. Otto (1954 ÄMÖR II 66) has righly rejected: “paßt nicht zu den recht unterschiedlichen Bedeutungen von m3d”, let alone the problem of -r + -d. " 7. E. Zyhlarz (1934, 111) suggested a comparison with SBrb.: Hgr. ÄdÄd “beißen, stechen mit Zahn oder Stachel”, hence re#. m-ÄdÄd “sich verbeißen” [Zhl.] = eded “1. mordre, 2. piquer (un animal ayant un aiguillon)” [Fcd. 1951–2, 163], cf. also Ayr & EWlm. eded “mordre, piquer (scorpion)” [Alj. 1980, 18] = 2d2d “1. mordre, piquer (scorpion, serpent)”, t--ddod “morsure, coup de dent (plaie laissée par une morsure), piqure (faite par un animal ayant un aiguillon)” [PAM 2003, 78]. Approving and exploiting Zyhlarz’s idea, E. Otto (1954 ÄMÖR II 66 & fn. 5) saw in the case of Eg. m3d the underlying “Grundbedeutung in einem handwerklichen Terminus” that he de"ned as “verzahnen, ein Ding in ein anderes einpassen, einfugen”, whereby he deduced that here “. . . ebenfalls ein verbales m- Prä!x im Sinne der Reziprozität oder
878 m!d



Sozialität vorliegen könnte”. In addition, in Otto’s view, “möglich wäre eine Verwandtschaft mit” Eg. 3dm ~ 3db “stechen”, “ferner vielleicht auch” with Eg. 3df.t “Wurm, Schlange”. This is evidently incorrect both semantically (the far-fetched connection to teeth cannot be evidenced on Eg. grounds) and phonologically (Eg. -3- + Tuareg -d-).
nb1: For the Tuareg root cf. perhaps Sem. *%dd “to be pungent, sharp”, *%add
“pungent, sharp” [GT]: esp. Akk. eddu [< *%add-] “spitzig” [AHW 185] !! Hbr.
*%ad, pl. %add5m “sharp (sword)” [KB 291] ! Ar. %adda “to edge, sharpen (a knife,
a blade, a sword, or anything blunt), point, make sharp-pointed (an arrow-head or
the like, with a stone or "le)”, %add- “(extremity of the) edge, point (of sword, knife,
spear-head, arrow)” [Lane 524–5] !! Tigre %dd “to cut up” [KB] etc. !!! (?) Eg. %dd.t
“Göttin in Gestalt eines Skorpions” (BD, Wb III 206, 6) !!! presumably LECu. *%a**
[Dlg.: < *%add- in#uenced by *%-] “bitter” [Sasse] > esp. Konso ha**-3 “snake
venom” [Black] (LECu.: Dlg. 1973, 249; Black 1974, 196; Sasse 1979, 54). For Sem.
ECu.: Dlg. 1988, 631, #21; Eg.-AA: Takács 2005, 56–57, #4.31 & fn. 156.
nb2: Otto’s observation (borrowed from Kaplony quoted in ÄMÖR II 66, fn. 5) on
the relatedness of Eg. 3db ~ 3dm and 3df.t is, however, indeed correct, but their
AA correspondence is fully different from that suggested by Zyhlarz (cf. the entry for
m3f.t above).
nb3: In spite of some far-fetched attempts (like that by Zyhlarz 1934), the use of a
pre"x m- of reciprocity has not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated in Eg. In theory,
following Zyhlarz’s and Otto’s idea, one might ponder a derivation < fossilized pre
"x *m- + *gd “treffen”, cf. WCh.: AS *kat [k-/-t reg. < *g-/-d] “1. to "nd, 2. get”
[GT] = *k1at “to get” [Stl.] (AS: Hfm. 1975, 23, #188, Stl. 1977, 154, #90; 1987,
206, #570; GT 2004, 167–8). But this reasoning would contradict just the tr. root
mng. of Eg. )m3d.
" 8. C. T. Hodge (1969, 109, #22) too analyzed Eg. m3d as a compound of m- pre"x + *3d and erroneously equated the latter with Ar. )*dd and Hgr. )K-d that are semantically more than dubious.
nb: Cf. Ar. *adda I “1. avoir le dessus sur qqn. dans une querelle, 2. écarter qqn.
doucement, sans violence” [BK II 13] = “1. to overcome, 2. avert, turn s’one, send
away or back, prevent, hinder from doing sg. by gentle means” [Lane 1775] !!! SBrb.:
Hgr. e-Ked “moudre, réduire en poudre, à sec, par frottement entre deux corps durs)”
[Fcd. 1951–2, 1930].
" 9. W. Westendorf (1973, 139; KHW 234, fn. 9), in turn, surmised in it a metathesis of Eg. dm3 “zusammenfügen, vereinigen, vereint sein” (Wb V 457–9), to which he even attributed a baseless Grundbedeutung (!) “zusammenstoßen, treffen” (only very late attested).
nb: Cf. GR hrw-dm3 “Tag des Zusammentreffens (im Kampf)” (Wb V 459, 21–24) and
Cpt. (SALB) twmt etc. “treffen, begegnen, zusammenkommen” (KHW 234), which
evidently emanate from the (mostly late) pass. use of the old tr. mng. “vereinigen”.
m&d ~ m&d.w “Eigenschaftswort in den Namen der Cheops (%r. w-m3d.w als Horusname, m3d r nb.tj als nb.tj-Name)” (IV., Wb II 192, 10–11; cf.

actes du souverain, peut-être ‘celui qui touche au but’, ‘qui atteint ses objectifs’)” (Baud 1998, 23).
nb: M. Baud (1998, 23 & fn. 54) maintains the same m3d to occur in some older
(Dyn. II) private personal names assuming that “dans l’onomastique privée, son extinction
est encore plus ancienne: attesté dans les noms M3d-k3.j, M3d-sn et «n0-m3d, il se cantonne
à la période thinite”.
! The proper meaning is still to be de"ned. This question requires a more thorough analysis. Till then, we only may assume that it may have been an adj./part. signifying with a positive connotation. " 1. Whether m3d in the name of Cheops (and in others from the Thinite era) really has to do with this or that supposed primary sense of the Eg. verbal root m3d (above) or it represents rather a separate lexical root, has not yet been evidently demonstrated.
nb1: K. Sethe (1892, 52–56) and W. M. Müller (1909, 190) viewed that it represents
“apparently a participle” (Müller) of Eg. m3d “to press” (above). But their ideas on
the history of this root (Sethe: old m3r > *m3 with the loss of *-r > m3d with the
addition of -d in the MK, while Müller: m)r > m)d, sic!) can hardly be maintained.
P. Montet (quoted and refuted by M. Baud 1998, 21) rendered m3d.w as “celui qui
impose” (< m3d “presser, imposer”). Later, K. Sethe (ZÄS 62, 1926, 1–2) changed
his translation of the name m3d.w for “attached” (< m3d “to follow, adhere to”) that
was rightly declined by Baud (l.c.), since m3d in this sense is only attested accompa
nied by either w3.t or m2n “way” and only in private context. Its rendering as “der
Gelenkte” (Barta, ZÄS 114, 1987, 106) was received by Baud (l.c.) with reservation,
since a basic mng. “celui qui est guidé, dirigé” would imply that “elle donne à l’attribution
royale un caractère passéiste qui n’est guère admissible, et qui ne s’accorde pas à un contenu divin
de principe de gouvernement”. R. Gundlach (1998, 167–8) translated m3d.w as “(Horus)
der Austeilende” (Baud: “celui qui distribue, qui partage”), hence “der Wohltäter”
(Baud: “le bienfaiteur”), while m3d r nb.tj as “der gemäß den Beiden Herrinnen
Austeilende” (Baud: “celui qui partage conformément aux Deux Maîtresses”), which
was approved by Baud (1998, 21–22) arguing that “la répartition des richesses est effective
ment une prérogative royale”, which would allow an etithet “le dispensateur de bienfaits”.
Accordingly, Baud interpreted Redjedef ’s (Dyn. IV) name šzp m3d=f as “celui qui
reçoit sa distribution, (le fruit de) ses bienfaits” or “celui qui reçoit sa part, celui qui
reçoit sa juste dotation” or “le doté du partage” suggesting that m3d.w signi"ed “le
justement doté, le bien placé” and m3d-r-nb.tj “celui qui est doté conformément
à Nebty” wondering whether “peut-être s’agit-il de l’héritage royale envisagé comme un dû
envers un individu d’exception”. Alternatively, Baud (1998, 23) assumed in m3d.w an act.
part. of m3d “caractérisant l’individu associé à la manipulation de cet instrument”, thus šzp
m3d=f would denote “celui qui saisit, l’instrument à/pour m3d” or “celui qui reçoit
sa qualité de m3d” (arguing that “la nature exacte se rapporte à la justesse, à la précision et au
bien-fondé des actes du souverain”). In addition, Baud also proposed further possibilities
based on mdd “atteindre”: m3d.w “(peut-être) celui qui touche au bout”, šzp m3d=f
“(peut-être) celui qui atteint ses objectives”, respectively. At the same time, he (Baud
1998, 26) did not rule out that in these royal names simply the basic sense of m3d
“to press” underlies: mdd.w “peut véhiculer des images bien effrayantes de sorte que l’Horus
du même nom pouvait devenir sans dif!culté . . . ‘un oppresseur’ ”. J. Kahl (FÄW 207), in turn,
suggested a derivation from the alleged basic sense of Eg. m3d “richtig, genau sein”
(sic). But all these renderings have to remain equally speculative.
nb2: On the other hand, m3d occurs in further names of the archaic period and the
OK, whose signi"cation is equally uncertain. Baud (1998, 23 & fn. 56) found that
H. Ranke’s (PN II 293:4) rendering of m3d-k3=j (Dyn. II.) as “mein Ka trifft (?)” in
880 m!d



fact “ne fait évidemment guère de sens”. He equally doubted R. O. Faulkner’s hypothesis
that PT 2048 m3d.(t)-jt “Name einer Göttin” (Wb II 192, 13) denotes in fact “she
who does the will of the monarch” (AEPT 293–294, utt. 683, n. 2).
" 2. P. Langlois (1919, 160) too assumed an erroneous Eg. m3r.w (sic) vocalized by him as *mézru (sic) and identi"ed with Ar. mi)r- in an obscure way. Absurd. " 3. GT: if, however, we presume that it was derived from a distinct root that had become out of use (and no longer understood), our presumption seems to be supported by Sem. *mgd (var. to *ngd?). Of course, mapping the semantical history of both Sem. roots and their relations to the Eg. m3d lexemes (if any) has to te subject to further research.

hard (1984, 270, #271), in turn, regarded the C3 of PSem. *mgd “to be exalted,
eminent” as root extension (baseless).

I 12:7, 210:4, 211:17, AECT II 246–7, spell 681, n. 8) = “eine Au#age” (LÄ VII 468 index) = “Abgabe, Au#age” (GHWb 383) = “obligation, imposition, contribution, une corvée” (Baud 1998, 20), (2) jrj m3d. wt “to perform service due to” (CT VI 308d, AECT II 246–7, spell 681, n. 8; DCT 195). ! If this is a distinct root from Eg. m3d “treffen etc.” (above), Most attractive is naturally solution #1. " 1. A. Moret (l.c.) derived this kind of use of m3d from the basic mng. of Eg. m3d de"ned by him as “press(ur)er”, which seems quite logical (at least, for a European mind). " 2. H. Goedicke (1967 KDAR, 125, n. 23) and M. Baud (1998, 20), in turn, preferred to combine it rather with Eg. m3d.t “Anteil der Totenpriester” (OK, Gdk.) and m3d “Einteilung” (Urk. I 12:7). Baud conceived m3d “corvée” as “part qui pèse” suggesting an ultimate derivation from m3d “p(r)es(s)er”. " 3. GT: or, purely hypothetically, one might ponder whether we are dealing with a remotely related re#ex of Sem. *mgd “to make a generous offering” [GT] displaying a different semantic development, which is all the more noteworthy, since there is a certain semantical overlapping also between some other Eg. m3d words and certain further re#exes of Sem. *mgd (above).
nb1: Cp. esp. Can.: Palm. mgd pael “to make a generous present” [Zbr.] = mgd
“liberality, generous gift, offering” [DNWSI 592: from Ar.?] = mgd “to present as a
gift” vs. mgd" “precious offering” [KB after Jean], Hbr. *meged, st.cstr.pl. m2g3d5m
“köstliche, edle Gabe (der Natur)” [GB 395–6: “wohl ” < Palm.] = “gift, present”
[Zbr.] = “"ne fruits, delicacies” [KB 543], Hbr. meged “excellence, excellent or
choice things” [Bmh.], PBHbr. meged “1. köstliche, edle Gabe (bes. der Natur),
2. köstliche Früchte” [Levy 1924 III 12] = “precious goods, esp. "ne fruit (orig.:
alloted gift)” [ Jastrow 1950, 726], JAram. migd3 ~ magd3 “Kostbarkeit, köstliche
882 m!d



Frucht” [Levy l.c.] = magd3 ~ migd3 “precious ware, "ne fruit” [ Jastrow], Syr.
magd3 “fruit”, magdon1 “precious gifts” [KB] !! Ar. mCd II “3. faire un don généreux,
considérable” [BK II 1063] = II “reichlich schenken” [GB] = II “to bestow, make
a present” [Zbr.] !!! ECh.: (?) EDng. mágdyì “riche, fortuné”, m3gdy5n3w (f )
“richesse, abondance, fortune” [Dbr.-Mnt. 1973, 191] (GT: borrowed from Ar.?).
Note that CCh.: Mada mìyg*á “notable, riche” [Brt.-Brunet 2000, 197] is a recent
borrowing from Mandara.
nb2: The etymology of Sem. *mgd has long been disputed. M. Jastrow (l.c.) took
Hbr. mgd (via pre"x m-) from Hbr. gdd > g3d “fortune”. A. Zaborski (1971, 61,
#48) too derived it from Sem. biconsonantal *gd “to make a present, be muni"cient”
assuming an ultimate connection with Ar. Cwd: C3da “to be generous, muni"cient,
offer generously”, nCd “to help”, Cdw: Cad3 “to offer as a gift, make a present” and
OSA gdy IV “to make a present, bestow”. A. R. Bomhard (1984, 270, #271), in
turn, regarded the C3 of PSem. *mgd “to be exalted, eminent” as root extension
(baseless).
m&d “Einteilen” (OK: Urk. I 12:7, Gdk. 1967 KDAR, 125, n. 23) = “portion (of lands, people and everything)” (Breasted quoted by Moret) = “presser, peser avec une balance, mesurer” > “délimitation, dispositions” (Moret 1907, 78–79) = “partager” (V. 1x, PK 1976 I, 227; AL 77.1967) = “8. teilen” (GHWb 383; ÄWb I 583) = “partager; distribution, partage” (Baud 1998, 20).
nb1: The translations vary depending on whether the exx. are taken to be infs./ver
bal nouns or verbs.
nb2: The rendering of m+d (Baud 1998, 21: m+d.t, false, since it can only be an inf.
here) in Merikare 123 (+b3.tw z0 m mjtj=f, m+d pw jr.wt nb.wt, Baud l.c.: “un [mau
vais] coup est payé par son semblable, c’est . . . de tous les actes”) has been strongly
debated (cf. Baud l.c, fn. 42). E.g., Gardiner ( JEA 1, 1914, 33): “consequence”,
Otto (ÄMÖR II 66): “Konsequenz” < “das Ineinandergreifen (des allen Tuns)”;
Lichtheim (AEL I 105): “response”; Helck (1988, 76–77): “Verknüpfung”; PK (1976,
227–8) supported by Baud (l.c.): “la ( juste) part”.
! Hence: m3d.t “Anteil bei einer Teilung (?)” (OK: Urk. I 13:2, 14:1, 14:11, Wb II 192, 15; GHWb 383) = “Anteil (der Totenpriester)” (Gdk. l.c.) = “part (dans un partage)” (OK: V., PK 1976 I, 228, cf. fn. 1 for Urk. I 12–13 & CT VI 308d, AL 77.1968, 78.1953) = “part (d’un partage)” (Baud 1998, 20).
nb: Faulkner (AECT II 247, spell 681, n. 8) explained m3d.t in CT VI 308d as
“service due to”.
! Origin uncertain. GT: since no Sem. or other AA parallels with the sense “to divide” (or sim.) have been found, an inner Eg. innovation seems very likely.
nb: Following A. Moret (l.c.), H. Goedicke (l.c.) and Baud (1998, 20) related it to
Eg. m3d “Steuer” (above). Baud (1998, 21) explained both m3d “partager” and
m3d “contribution, imposition” from the primary sense “presser, peser” via “part
qui pèse”. R. Hannig (GHWb, ÄWb l.c.) too listed both the verb “teilen” and the
noun “Anteil” as derivatives of Eg. mdd “treffen”. P. Posener-Kriéger (l.c.), in turn,
remained more careful stating merely that the primary verbal sense of the underlying
root was unknown.
m!d 883



m&d#.t (GW, written also m&#.t ~ m&d.t) “(in einer Liste von Geräten)” (late NK, Wb II 193, 2) = “la pierre à moudre et à piler, mortier” (Dévaud 1921, 171–2) = “mortar” (,erný, JEA 31, 1945, 38; Janssen 1975, 326–7, §97; 1991, 86, n. o; DLE I 260; cf. also JEA 77, 1991, 86) = “Mörser” (KHW 638) = “mortier” (AL 77.1966, 79.1441 pace Frandsen 1979, 289, 295) = “objet en pierre” (DELC pace Wb) = “mortar, quern” (Hoch 1994, 179 with further lit.) > Cpt. (SB) mjatH, (via met.) mjaHt (f ) “mortier (pour piler)” (Dévaud 1921, 171; DELC 133) = “mortar” (CD 214a) = “Mörser” (Stricker 1937, 5; Vrg. 1950, 293; KHW 114).
nb1: The Ramesside form occurs in the following vars.: m3d%.t (Ostr. Cairo 25670,
rt. 2:6, XIX./XX.) ~ m3%.t (Naunakhte passim, XX. & Pap. BM 10401, 1:11, XX.)
~ m3d.t (Ostr. DeM 69, 5). J. J. Janssen (l.c.) adds an odd var. md%.t (spelled m3d%.
wt) in Ostr. Cairo 25678, 25 & 27.
nb2: The proper spelling of the word has been misunderstood as most works quoted
above (,erný, CED, KHW, AL, DELC, Ward, GHWb) suggest to read only m3%.t,
while the old rdg. m3d%.t (Wb) has apparently long been abandoned. For reading
the group -3d- in the late NK as -3- (GW) > -ja- cf. ,erný, JEA 31, 1945, 38; GMT
§23.2; KHW 114, fn. 5; Ward 1985, 333, fn. 20. Nevertheless, the Cpt. evidence
clearly testi"es to that -d- (whence Cpt. -t-) was indeed pronounced after -3- and
thus it cannot be regarded merely as part of a “group” for -3- in this case.
nb3: Syllabic spelling for the diverse vars.: m()-Ha-%()-t ~ var. m()-He-%-ta (Helck 1962,
587) = ma-3d-%-tá ~ ma-3d-tá (so, -3d-!) (Ward), which, for the reason discussed in
nb2, cannot be accepted.
nb4: W. Westendorf (KHW 114) surmised a connection between Cpt. re#exes and
(P) moujG “mischen”, which is certainly erroneous, the underlying root of the latter
being entirely different (m2k).
! Most attractive seems solution #3. " 1. É. Dévaud (1921, 171–2) surmised that it was perhaps “un mot étranger”. So viewed W. Helck (1962, 587) too classifying our word among the “asiatische Fremdworte im Ägyptischen”. However, both of them failed to present the lexical evidence. J. Hoch’s (1994, 179, #242) idea in this respect is hardly tenable: he projected an unattested *ma9%atta (?) re#ecting a fem. Can. nomen instr. of common Sem. *9%n “to grind” (cf. MHbr. ma9%1n “grinding mill”, NHbr. ma9%1n3 “grinder”) assuming that the anomalous Eg. 3 < Sem. *9 (“not expected ” by Hoch either) was “perhaps” due to *-%-. " 2. W. A. Ward (1985, 333, §6), in turn, maintained that the group -tj was a fem. ending (in GW) also for native words and derived our word from Eg. m3% “to hew wood, cut stone”, which is equally false as (1) the consonantal sequences do not overlap and (2) because, in the case of a quadriconsonantal term denoting an instrument and having an initial m-, one would logically (and a priori ) expect an original triconsonantal root (3d%) without m-.
884 m!d".t



" 3. GT: in principle, m3d%.t might be an m- pre"x nomen instr. of an unattested Eg. root *3d% “to pound (or sim.)”, which might derive from an earlier *gd% (or *g9%). In this context, highly noteworthy is NAgaw: Bilin m2gd2« “Mörser” [Lmb.] = “mortar” [LT 1997, 500,
505], whose origin is equally obscure (apparently from ES because of -«), but it clearly represents an m- pre"x nomen instr. of *)gd«. In
theory, we may not rule out a cognacy (inherited from AA) between ES *gwd« “to crush” (?) [GT] and pre-Eg. *gd%.
nb1: M. Lamberti and L. Tonelli (l.c.) supposed the (apparently isolated) Bilin form
to be “probably of Semitic origin”, but they failed to identify the ES root in question,
which, in any case (even if it is unattested and thus merely hypothetic), may be akin
to Sem. *gd« (or *gwd«?) > Hbr. gd« qal “1. to cut off (arm, horn, trees), 2. scatter
(staff, peoples, army)”, nifal “1. to be cut off, 2. be cut down into pieces, 3. cut to
pieces” [KB 180], JAram. g2da« “abstumpfen, abhacken” [Lévy 1924 I 303] ! Ar.
Cada«a I “1. mutiler qqn.” [BK I 264] = “to cut off the nose, mutilate, make injury,
diminute, destroy” [Lane 390] = “mutiler qqn., lui trancher le nez, l’essoriller,
trancher (la main, le pied)” [Blachère I 1364] !! ES *gwd« “to crush” [GT] > Geez
gwad"a ~ gwad«a “to strike, smite, thrust, knock, crush, shake, touch, butt, heave with
sobs” > magwd2", Tigre gäd"a “to push, pound”, Tna. gwäd«e “to crush, damage”
etc. (ES: Lsl. 1987, 180).
nb2: A remote AA cognate to ES *gwd« and Eg. *3d% “to pound in mortar” may
perhaps appear in CCh.: Mnd. •gdzP dzra “pilon” [Mch.] ! Musgu g ́;a “stampfen,
schlagen” [Lks. 1941, 56] = g23a “piler” [Mch.] (CCh.: Mch. 1950, 44) !! ECh.:
Kwang kùt1 “to pound (in mortar)” [ Jng./JI 1994 II 269] – unless the CCh. forms
come from AA *–-1 [GT].
nb3: For the irregular (?) correspondence of Sem. *-d« (a sequence that is incom
patible in native Eg. roots) vs. Eg. -d% (instead of -d0, cf. EDE I 326–7), a striking
parallel can be quoted, cf. Eg. 3d% [reg. < *gd%] “verhaften, einsperren, gefangen
setzen, (Feinde) einschließen (in einer Stadt)” (XVIII., Wb V 635) " 3d%.w “Gefäng
nis” (LP, Wb V 635, 13) > Dem. 3t% “1. Verhaften, 2. Haft” (DG 688) > (?) Cpt.
(O) jtaH “ins Gefängnis kommen, verhaftet werden” (Spg. KHW 280 pace Grif"th
1900, 78–79) = “Gefängnis (?)” (Wst. KHW 437) !!! Ar. Cada«a I “2. jeter qqn. dans
un cachot, dans les fers” [BK l.c.] = “to con"ne, restrict, imprison” [Lane l.c.] = “2.
séquestrer, incarcérer” [DRS 102].
nb4: Earlier, M. Lamberti (1988, 98, #236; 1993, 111; 1993 Yemsa, 364–5; 1993
Sns., 354) suggested a fully different (Cu.-Om.) etymology for Bilin m2gd2« “Mörser”,
which he ultimately derived from his hypothetic and baseless “OCu.” (i.e., PCu.
Om.) *m.gw- “Mörser” [Lmb.] and erroneously af"liated it with a number of unre
lated synonymous terms that can be grouped as follows: (1) LECu.: Saho m.góU, pl.
måwãgeU (m) [Rn.: *ma-ûgeU < *ma-ûge*] “Mörser” [Rn. 1890, 260] = môg4*
“mortier” [CR] = m.go* (-dh) “Mörser” [Lmb.] = m.goJ (-rh: voiced retro#ex #ap)
“mortar” [Vergari 2003, 136], whereby Lamberti assumed a deglottalization of the
velar C2 (*-gw-) and an additional suf"x -*- (-dh-). But the Saho term is in fact ulti
mately related to ES forms like Harari m.qäæ [Lsl.], Amh. muqaææa “mortar” [Lsl.]
= mawqaæ3 [Hds.], cf. also Amh. m4wg4æ4 “mortier” [CR] = mäwgäæa [Apl.] =
mawgaæ3 “mortar (of ‘mortar and pestle’, for grinding coffee, spices)”, which repre
sent an instrumental noun formation with mä- pre"x + -ya suf"x (palatalizing -9- as
-æ-) deriving from ES *wq9 “to crush” ~ Amh. var. wg9 “pound in mortar, crush
(testicles)”, signifying thus lit. “an instrument for pounding something” (Lsl. 1963,
109; also p.c. by G. Hudson, L. Bender, and D. Appleyard on 12 July 2007). (2)
m!d".t 885



LECu.: Afar madagge “Mörser” [Lmb.], cf. also Saho madagdag “little mortar for
coffee” [Vergari 2003, 129]. But this term can hardly be related (via metathesis) as
even M. Vergari (l.c.) supposed combining it with Saho m.goJ (-rh) “mortar” (above).
Instead, cf. rather NBrb.: Shilh a-mada3 “meule” [ Jst. 1914, 121] < Ar. madaqq
“endroit que l’on bat pour l’aplatir ou l’amollir”, cf. also muduqq- ~ midaqq- ~
madaqq-at- ~ midaqq-at- “1. battoir, 2. maillet en bois, 3. pilon pour broyer ou
égruger les aromates, les graines, le blé, 4. instrument pour aplatir le sol” < daqqa
“(con)casser” [BK I 715–6]. A connection with ES: Geez mad0e “upper millstone”
[Lsl. 1987, 130] (explained by W. Leslau 1988, 72 from Ar. da%3 “to push”) seems
less probable. (3) ECu. *m.y- “mortar” [Lmb. < *m.gw-], which clearly represents
a distinct AA root, namely AA *m-y “to pound” [GT] (cf. Takács: Lexica Afroasi
atica VII, forthcoming, #628). Besides, L. Reinisch (1884, 391; 1895, 96) and
G. Conti Rossini (1912, 234) also combined the LECu.: Saho m.góU “Mörser” [Rn.]
with NAgaw: Qwara mô ~ maû “Mörser” [Rn.] = “pilar” [Flad], Qemant maw
“mortier” [CR] !! LECu.: Orm. moyé [Rn.] and even LECu.: Hamir m4g† ~ mig†
“Mörser” [Rn.]. False. (4) NOm.: Yemsa mo=oy- “mahlen (durch Stampfen)”,
mo=oyò “Mörser” [Lmb.], for which cf. rather AA *m-k “to pound (in mortar)”
[GT] (cf. Takács: Lexica Afroasiatica VI, forthcoming, #546). (5) NOm.: Sns.
Bworo m.ngá “Mörser” [Lmb.], which seems equally unrelated.
