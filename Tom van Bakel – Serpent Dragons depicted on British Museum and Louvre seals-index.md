# Index for Tom van Bakel – Serpent Dragons depicted on British Museum and Louvre seals.pdf

Serpent Dragons depicted on British Museum and Louvre seals
In this essay I show the results of my research on two cylinder seals showing two heavily armed heroes running over two tall reptiles
Number 1
According to the experts at the British Museum, the original seal of this imprint was produced between 900 BC. and 750 BC in a neo-Assyrian style.
They believe that the snout-nosed horned reptile is Tiamat and that the bearded god running past the reptile is Ninurta: according to them, this print illustrates a scene from the Epic of Creation in which the forces of chaos, led by Tiamat, are defeated by Ninurta representing the cosmic order.
In this essay, however, I argue that this imprint depicts Ninĝišzida, who is portrayed as a dragon rising early in the morning, and Ninĝirsu, who is depicted as a running warrior.
Except for one detail, all scenes can be perfectly understood on the basis of the story: 'The
building of the temple of Ninĝirsu (Gudea, cylinders A and B)'.
I will say it in advance, the goddess on the left is Ninsumun and the man with a scepter is the
owner of the seal, he is the son of Ninĝišzida and Ninsumun just like the famous ruler Gudea.



Number 2
Here is the second imprint. According to the experts of the Louvre, the original cylinder seal was made in Assyria, in the 9th-8th centuries BC. They believe that it depicts a mythological scene: Assur, being cheered by a goddess, attacks a monster.
Again, I think this imprint depicts Ninĝišzida as a dragon rising early in the morning, and
Ninĝirsu is depicted as a running warrior.
Reading 'The Building of the Temple of Ninĝirsu (Gudea, Cylinders A and B)' the woman at
the temple is a slave woman beating a drum, and the kneeling man is not a king but a citizen:
he is the son of Ninĝirsu and this slave woman.
Number 3
This is one of three astrological tablets found in Uruk. Originally the set consisted of twelve tablets. This part shows Leo, Hydra and Jupiter. Here we can see that the constellation Hydra is quite similar to the reptiles on the two imprints.



Number 1
When naming the various figures on this imprint, we naturally start with the impressive reptile. It resembles the celestial serpent depicted in the drawing of the astrological tablet:
Number 4
In this drawing, the constellations Leo and Hydra are clearly visible, and the star on the left is Jupiter. According to the star catalog Mul.Apin, Ningishzida is the god of the constellation ‘the Snake’, we call: ‘Hydra’:
8 The Snake (MUSH), d.NIN.GISH.ZI.DA, lord of the underworld [Hydra]
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
The resemblance to the reptiles on the two cylinder seals is striking and therefore it is reasonable to assume that these two animals represent Ninĝišzida. In 'The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B)' much has been written about this god and, believe it or not, scenes depicted on the seals are described in this story.



That Ninĝišzida can be represented as a reptile is confirmed in the following balbale, for in this poem he is called both a dragon and a venomous serpent:
A balbale to Ninĝišzida (Ninĝišzida B)
1-7. Lord with holy dignity, imbued with great savage awesomeness! My king, Lord Ninĝišzida,

2 lines fragmentary Lord Ninĝišzida, your praise is sweet. 25. A balbale of Ninĝišzida.
Number 1
Ninsumun Gudea Ninĝišzida Ninĝirsu
In this drawing, based on two fragmentary seal impressions found in Lagash, the cuneiform inscription reads: 'Gudea, ruler (of) Lagash'. This, of course, meant that the original seal belonged to Gudea, the builder of Ninĝirsu's
temple.
Here his divine father Ninĝišzida is not depicted as a reptile, but as a human being
characterized by two dragon heads sprouting from his shoulders.



Number 1
In ‘The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B)’ the god Ninĝirsu is
constantly referred to as a warrior:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
39-51. ‘Warrior, rampant lion, who has no opponent! Ninĝirsu, important in the abzu, respected in Nibru! Warrior, I want to carry out faithfully what you have commanded me; Ninĝirsu, I want to build up your house for you, I want to make it perfect for you, so I will ask your sister, the child born
of Eridug, an authority on her own, the lady, the dream-interpreter among the gods, my divine sister
from Sirara, Nanše, to show me the way.’
He is therefore the one depicted as a running warrior on both imprints.
As you can see, Ninĝirsu is also called: 'rampant lion'. This means that if we replace the warrior in the imprint with a lion, the new scene will resemble the constellations of Leo and Hydra as depicted on the Uruk Tablet as well as on the next Dendera Zodiac. This means that the warrior and the reptile do not fight each other: they just represent two zodiac signs.
Leo and Hydra on the Dendera Zodiac
These are the constellations Leo and Hydra as depicted on the Dendera Zodiac made in Egypt.



Number 2
In both imprints, Ninĝirsu holds a striking weapon in his hand. It can act independently and
therefore has its own name: Šar-ur ('Smasher of Thousands'). In the temple story this weapon plays a crucial role:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
241-247. ‘I am Ninĝirsu who has turned back the fierce waters, the great warrior of Enlil's realm, a
lord without opponent. My house the E-ninnu, a crown, is bigger than the mountains; my weapon the
Šar-ur subdues all the lands. No country can bear my fierce stare, nobody escapes my outstretched
arms.’
405-411. Lord Ninĝirsu directed Gudea into the impenetrable mountain of cedars and he cut down
its cedars with great axes and carved the Šar-ur, the right arm of Lagaš, his master's flood-storm weapon, out of it.
It turns out to be an independent individual called ‘the mighty general of the E-ninnu’:
971-982. With his divine duties, namely to carry the seven-headed mace; to open the door of the an
kar house, the Gate of Battle; to hit exactly with the dagger blades, with the mitum mace, with the
‘floodstorm’ weapon and with the marratum club, its battle tools; to inundate Enlil's enemy land,
Gudea introduced Lugal-kur-dub, the warrior Šar-ur, who in battle subdues all the foreign lands,
the mighty general of the E-ninnu, a falcon against the rebel lands, his general, to Lord Ninĝirsu.
983-989. After the heavenly mitum mace had roared against the foreign lands like a fierce storm -the Šar-ur, the flood storm in battle, the cudgel for the rebel lands -- after the lord had frowned at the rebellious land, the foreign country, hurled at it his furious words, driven it insane (the text here seems to be corrupt, and there may be some lines missing).



Number 1
On the right side of this imprint is a female figure. A star is situated above her.
an [SKY] (1598x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. An ‘sky, heaven; upper; crown (of a tree)’ Akk. Šamû
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
As you can see, a star sign has several meanings: the usual meaning is 'heaven'.
diĝir [DEITY] (1837x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old
Babylonian) wr. diĝir; dim3-me-er; dim3-me8-er; dim3-mi-ir; di-me2-er ‘deity, god, goddess’ Akk. iltu; ilu
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
But the star sign also indicates a god or goddess. On the imprint, the star therefore indicates
that the woman is a goddess: she turns out to be the divine mother Ninsumun, the wife of
Ninĝišzida:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
1337-1354. 3 lines fragmentary ‘...... grown as tall as Gilgameš. No one shall remove its throne set
up there. Your god, Lord Ninĝišzida, is the grandson of An; your divine mother is Ninsumun, the
bearing mother of good offspring, who loves her offspring; you are a child born by the true cow. You
are a true youth made to rise over the land of Lagaš by Ninĝirsu; your name is established from below to above. Gudea, nobody ...... what you say. You are ...... a man known to An. You are a true ruler, for whom the house has determined a good fate. Gudea, son of Ninĝišzida, you will enjoy a long life!’



Number 1
A human
The same star is also above the owner of the seal. Here it may suggest that this owner has divine duties, for example to hold the scepter of never-ending days;
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
944-956. With his divine duties, namely to guide the hand of the righteous one; to force the evil
doer's neck into a neck stock; to keep the house safe; to keep the house pleasant; to instruct his city
and the sanctuaries of Ĝirsu; to set up an auspicous throne; to hold the sceptre of never-ending days; to raise high the head of the shepherd called by Ninĝirsu, as if he wore a blue crown; and to
appoint to their offices in the courtyard of E-ninnu the skin-clad ones, the linen-clad ones and those
whose head is covered, Gudea introduced Ig-alim, the Great Door (ig gal), the Pole (dim) of Ĝirnun, the chief bailiff of Ĝirsu, his beloved son, to Lord Ninĝirsu.
He appears to have a lot of divine duties of which I will mention a few here:
957-970. With his divine duties, namely to keep the house clean; to let hands always be washed; to serve water to the lord with holy hands; to pour beer into bowls; to pour wine into jars; to make emmer beer in the brewery, the house of pure strength, fizz like the water of the Papsir canal; to
make certain that faultless cattle and goats, grain-fed sheep, fresh bread and hind's milk are
available day and night; to wake from sleep the noble one, Enlil's beloved son, the warrior Ninĝirsu, by offering (?) food and drink, Gudea introduced Šul-šaga, the lord of the pure hand-washings (šuluḫ), the first-born son of E-ninnu, to Ninĝirsu.
971-982. With his divine duties, namely to carry the seven-headed mace; to open the door of the an
kar house, the Gate of Battle; to hit exactly with the dagger blades, with the mitum mace, with the
‘floodstorm’ weapon and with the marratum club, its battle tools; to inundate Enlil's enemy land,
Gudea introduced Lugal-kur-dub, the warrior Šar-ur, who in battle subdues all the foreign lands, the
mighty general of the E-ninnu, a falcon against the rebel lands, his general, to Lord Ninĝirsu.



Number 1
Here we see the female figure has 'united' herself with the head of Ninĝišzida with her arms.
This scene suggests a Sacred Marriage and therefore the female must be Ninsumun, the wife
of Ninĝišzida:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
1337-1354. 3 lines fragmentary ‘...... grown as tall as Gilgameš. No one shall remove its throne set
up there. Your god, Lord Ninĝišzida, is the grandson of An; your divine mother is Ninsumun, the
bearing mother of good offspring, who loves her offspring; you are a child born by the true cow. You
are a true youth made to rise over the land of Lagaš by Ninĝirsu; your name is established from below to above. Gudea, nobody ...... what you say. You are ...... a man known to An. You are a true
ruler, for whom the house has determined a good fate. Gudea, son of Ninĝišzida, you will enjoy a
long life!’
Ninĝišzida and Ninsumun are the divine parents of the seal owner, as they are also the
divine parents of the ruler Gudea
.
As you can see Hydra's head is under Cancer. If a marriage is consummated when the sun passes through Hydra and a child is conceived on the wedding night, then that child will be born about nine months later in Aries, Pleiades or Taurus.



Number 1
The sickle in the frame naturally symbolizes the new moon, and during the new moon all major rituals and festivals were performed:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
262-265. ‘I founded the Tiraš shrine with as much majesty as the abzu. Each month at the new moon the great rites (?), my ‘Festival of An’, are performed for me perfectly in it.’
Even the new year started with the new moon:
863-870. The year ended and the month was completed. A new year started, a month began and
three days elapsed in that month. As Ninĝirsu arrived from Eridug, beautiful moonlight shone
illuminating the Land, and the E-ninnu competed with the new-born Suen.
And so also the Sacred Marriage of Ninĝišzida and Ninsumun was celebrated during the
new moon.



Number 1
In the small frame we see a diamond, which symbolizes a heart and a womb:
http://en.finaly.org/index.php/The_earliest_precursor_of_writing
On the imprint, the diamond symbolizes a womb which indicates the birth of a child.
This diamond is placed below the warrior Ninĝirsu, suggesting that the child was born when Ninĝirsu is the presiding deity of the Aries month. From the table on the next page, we can
see that Bel, which means ‘Lord’. is the presiding deity of this month.
Bel (/ˈbeɪl/; from Akkadian: bēlu), signifying ‘lord’ or ‘master’, is a title rather than a genuine name,
applied to various gods in the Mesopotamian religion of Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. The feminine form is Belit 'Lady, Mistress'. Bel is represented in Greek as Belos and in Latin as Belus. Linguistically, Bel is an East Semitic form cognate with the Northwest Semitic Baal with the same meaning.
Early translators of Akkadian believed that the ideogram for the god called in Sumerian Enlil was to be read as Bel in Akkadian. Current scholarship holds this as incorrect, but one finds Bel used in referring to Enlil in older translations and discussions.
Bel became especially used for the Babylonian god Marduk and when found in Assyrian and neoBabylonian personal names or mentioned in inscriptions in a Mesopotamian context, it can usually be taken as referring to Marduk and no other god. Similarly, Bêlit mostly refers to Bel Marduk's spouse Sarpanit. However, Marduk's mother, the Sumerian goddess called Ninhursag, Damkina, Ninmah and other names in Sumerian, was often known as Belit-ili (‘Lady of the Gods’) in Akkadian.
Other gods called ‘Lord’ could be and sometimes were identified totally or in part with Bel Marduk. The god Malak-bel of Palmyra is an example, though in the later period from which most of our information comes he seems to have become very much a sun god.
Similarly, Zeus Belus mentioned by Sanchuniathon as born to Cronus/El in Peraea is unlikely to be Marduk.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_(mythology)



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_calendar
As you can see from this table, the presiding deity of Aries is called 'Bel/Lord' and in the
temple story Ninĝirsu is almost always called 'Lord'.
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
207-216. He rose to his master in public and prayed to him; he went to him in the Ubšu-unkena and
saluted him: ‘My master Ninĝirsu, lord who has turned back the fierce waters, true lord, semen ejaculated by the Great Mountain, noble young hero who has no opponent! Ninĝirsu, I am going to
build up your house for you, but I lack an ominous sign. Warrior, you asked for perfection, but, son
of Enlil, Lord Ninĝirsu, you did not let me know your will as to how to achieve it.’
217-225. ‘Your will, ever-rising as the sea, crashing down as a destructive flood, roaring like gushing waters, destroying cities (?) like a flood-wave, battering against the rebel lands like a storm; my master, your will, gushing water that no one can stem; warrior, your will inconceivable as the heavens -- can I learn anything about it from you, son of Enlil, Lord Ninĝirsu?’
And thus Ninĝirsu is the 'Bel', in other words: the 'Lord' of this temple story and when the diamond is placed below him it suggests that the child, who is conceived in Hydra is born in Aries, so the month of 'the Lord'.



Thus, the owner of the seal is conceived by Ninĝišzida and his wife Bau when the sun passes through Hydra and born about nine months later when the sun passes through Aries.
Number 4
This imprint broadly conveys the same message: a child was conceived when the sun passed through Hydra (represented by the serpent) and he was born about nine months later when the sun passed through Aries (represented by the sheep in the middle).



Number 1
Seal owner
Because Ninĝišzida and Ninsumun are the divine parents of the seal owner, the man in the
frame, he must be important and therefore he is allowed to hold the scepter of never-ending days:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
944-956. With his divine duties, namely to guide the hand of the righteous one; to force the evil
doer's neck into a neck stock; to keep the house safe; to keep the house pleasant; to instruct his city
and the sanctuaries of Ĝirsu; to set up an auspicous throne; to hold the sceptre of never-ending days; to raise high the head of the shepherd called by Ninĝirsu, as if he wore a blue crown; and to
appoint to their offices in the courtyard of E-ninnu the skin-clad ones, the linen-clad ones and those
whose head is covered, Gudea introduced Ig-alim, the Great Door (ig gal), the Pole (dim) of Ĝir
nun, the chief bailiff of Ĝirsu, his beloved son, to Lord Ninĝirsu.
On the other seal, the owner is just an ordinary citizen: although his father is the god
Ninĝirsu, his mother is an anonymous slave-woman.



Number 2
In the frame we see a woman beating a drum. In the story about the building of a temple we read that young slave women did that:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
1155-1181. With his duties, namely to fill the channels with flowing water; to make the marshes full with carp and perch (?) and to have the inspector of fisheries and the inspector of dykes stand at their posts; to fill the great waters with boats carrying grain; to see that tons, heaps and tons -- the yield of the land of Lagaš -- will be piled up; to see that cattle-pens and sheepfolds will be erected; to see that lambs abound around healthy ewes; to have the rams let loose on the healthy ewes; to see that numerous calves stand beside healthy cows; to see that breed bulls bellow loudly among them; to have the oxen properly yoked and to have the farmers and ox drivers stand beside them; to have
donkeys carry packsaddles and to have their drivers, who feed them, follow behind them; to see that
large copper ...... will be strapped onto jackasses; to see that the principal mill will produce (?); to ...... the house of Ninĝirsu's young slave women; to set ...... right; to see that the courtyard of the
E-ninnu will be filled with joy; to see that the ala drums and balaĝ drum will sound in perfect
concert with the sim drums, and to see that his beloved drum Ušumgal-kalama will walk in front of
the procession, the ruler who had built the E-ninnu, Gudea, himself entered before Lord Ninĝirsu.
The drum thus indicates that the woman is a slave. Then we read something very special: when the master entered the house, for seven days the slave women were allowed to be equal to their mistresses:
1211-1223. He had everything function as it should in his city. Gudea had built the E-ninnu, made its
powers perfect. He brought butter and cream into its dairy and provided its ...... with bread (?). He
had debts remitted and made all hands clear. When his master entered the house, for seven days the slave woman was allowed to became equal to her mistress and the slave was allowed to walk side by side with his master. But the ritually unclean ones could sleep only at the border of his city. He silenced the evil-speaking tongue and locked up evil.
And this, of course, gave Ninĝirsu the opportunity to unite with one of these slave women.
The child that came out of that was the civil seal owner who was on his knees.



Number 2
In the large frame we see that a drumming slave woman standing directly opposite the
warrior god Ninĝirsu. This arrangement suggests that these two unite with each other.
In the smaller frame we see the head of Hydra again. This suggests that Ninĝirsu's marriage to the slave woman was consummated when the sun passed through this constellation.
Number 2
In the lower frame we see another womb sign suggesting the birth of a child conceived on
the wedding night of Ninĝirsu and the slave woman. He was born about nine months later
when the sun passed through the constellation Pleiades (represented by the seven dots in the top frame).



So, the owner of the seal was conceived when the sun passed through the head of Hydra and was born in Pleiades about nine months later.
Number 5
This imprint broadly conveys the same message: a child (the griffin) was conceived when the sun passed through Hydra (represented by the serpent) and he was born about nine months later when the sun passed through Pleiades (the seven dots).



Number 2 \
Here the owner of the seal is depicted in the frame: he was conceived in Hydra and born in Pleiades. In the temple story it is said that the ruler (Gudea) made the whole city kneel down, made the whole land prostrate itself:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
892-906. They sheared the black ewes and milked the udder of the cow of heaven. They cleaned the
E-ninnu, they polished it with brooms of tamarisk and ....... The ruler made the whole city kneel
down, made the whole land prostrate itself. He levelled what was high, rejected chance utterances (?); the sorcerers' spittle (?) was removed from the roads. In the city only the mother of a sick person administered a potion. The wild animals, creatures of the steppe, all had crouched together. The lions and the dragons of the steppe were lying asleep.
This means, that the kneeling man is one of the citizans who has to kneel down and prostrate himself. The next sentence suggests that he has to pray:
907-909. The day was for supplication, the night was for prayer. The moonlight ...... early morning. Its master .......
Unfortunately, we cannot read of other duties, or what the object placed before him is supposed to represent, for the text breaks off.



Number 2
There are three characters on this imprint that correspond to the character 'me'.
me [BEING] (750x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Old Babylonian) wr. me ‘Being, divine properties enabling cosmic activity; office; (cultic) ordinance’ Akk. mû; parşu
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
One of the meanings is 'ordinance', and I think that meaning applies here.
One of the three signs is placed in front of the slave girl, as she is allowed to be equal to her mistress:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
1211-1223. He had everything function as it should in his city. Gudea had built the E-ninnu, made its
powers perfect. He brought butter and cream into its dairy and provided its ...... with bread (?). He
had debts remitted and made all hands clear. When his master entered the house, for seven days the slave woman was allowed to became equal to her mistress and the slave was allowed to walk side by side with his master. But the ritually unclean ones could sleep only at the border of his city. He silenced the evil-speaking tongue and locked up evil.
A sign stands by the rising Ninĝišzida serpent, which suggested that the important decisions
were made in the morning:
925-928. The daylight came out, the fate had been decided. Bau entered her E-mi quarters, and
there was abundance for the land of Lagaš. The day dawned. Utu of Lagaš lifted his head over the
Land.
A sign stands below the kneeling seal owner. This suggested that Ninĝirsu decided a fate for
this man as he did for Gudea:
647-650. The stela which he set up facing E-uru-ga he named as ‘Lord Ninĝirsu has decided a good
fate for Gudea’.



Number 2
Het crescent on top may have suggested that this citizan was born at new moon, when a new year started:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple (Gudea, cylinders A and B): c.2.1.7
863-870. The year ended and the month was completed. A new year started, a month began and
three days elapsed in that month. As Ninĝirsu arrived from Eridug, beautiful moonlight shone
illuminating the Land, and the E-ninnu competed with the new-born Suen.
All in all, you have seen that it is possible that different scenes on the two tablets from the temple story can be explained.

Number 1 British Museum number: 89589 Description: Black or dark brown and pale brown serpentinite cylinder seal in the linear style; a snout-nosed, horned reptile (Tiamat as a dragon?) faces left; the upper third of its long, crosshatched body rises vertically from two front paws or hands, one of which is raised; the remainder of the body runs around the bottom of the seal and supports three figures; there are no hind legs. A bearded god (Ninurta?) runs along the reptile's body towards the left; he wears a feather-topped head-dress and a vertically-striated, tiered and fringed open robe over a fringed kilt and has crossed, wedge-tipped quivers on his back. His arms are stretched out on either side, and in his right hand he holds a six-pronged thunderbolt below which is a rhomb, while in his left he holds two arrows. Behind the god, and advancing towards the left, is a smaller bearded god in a horned (?) head-dress with a long, tasselled streamer or necklace counterweight hanging down behind; he wears an open robe similar to that of the running god and holds a spear before him in both hands. On the tail of the reptile, with her back to the smaller god, stands an even smaller goddess, who wears a feather-topped, horned head-dress with a short tassel or necklace counterweight hanging behind, and a belted, vertically striated, tiered robe; she holds her arms open to seize the snout of the reptile. To the left of her head is a small globe-with-rays and to the right, a crescent. Line borders at top and bottom broken by the running god's head-dress. The seal may illustrate a scene from the epic of creation in which the forces of chaos, led by Tiamat, are defeated by a god representing cosmic order, probably Ninurta. Shiny, some chipping and weathering; note that there is a chip by the smaller god's shoulder and the tassel of his streamer may mask damage. Cultures/periods: Neo-Assyrian Production date: 900BC-750BC Made in: Asia Materials: serpentine Dimensions: Diameter: 1.75 centimetres, Height: 3.40 centimetres According to catalogue ‘Boehmer dates the seal to the third quarter of the eighth century but an earlier date is preferred here. Note that the arrows and spear are indicated by broken lines. Note also the fringed underside of the lower part of the running god's robe, parallel to the dragon's body and to his left leg. For a female assistant see two seals in Fribourg in the cut-and-drilled style of the early seventh century. An archer assistant is depicted on a fragmentary seal in the hard-stone version of this design’.

On a cubic seat whose ornamentation has almost entirely disappeared, a god (Enki?), Wearing the tulle of the hulticorne and dressed in kaunakes, sits in profile to the left. With his left hand, brought back to his waist, he holds by the neck a vase from which flow two waves rising above his shoulders; One falls backwards into a similar vessel placed on the ground; The other is going to throw himself into one of the two waves which spring forth on the right and left of a sacred plant with three stems, of a third vase which the god holds in front in his right hand. The footstool of his throne is formed by two vases, the undulating waters of which slip below the siege, spread out in four waves, which merge with those which spring from the vessel placed behind. The ishakku, shaved head and clad in fringed shawl, raises his right hand to the height of his face; His left hand, open in profile and his wrist held by his personal boss, the god Ningizida, who presents it to the god. Ningizida is characterized by two dragon heads erected above his shoulders; He is dressed in kaunakes and wearing the multicorne tiara;



Her long hair is raised in a large bun; His free hand is not raised, as might be expected, but is placed under the body of the vessel which the god of the abyss holds by the neck and seems to bear it. Behind the scene, near the ishakku, a goddess wearing the tiara with horns and dressed in Shawl
with vertical stripes, makes the gesture of adoration.
Legend: ‘Gudea, ruler of Lagash.’
Under the cartouche of the legend, a dragon passing to the right: a winged quadruped with anterior lion limbs, posterior hindquarters of a raptor, a scorpion's tail; Its flat head, with its forked tongue, is crowned with the hat with two horns and double egret, stylization of the divine tiara, and on the side it is adorned.
