THE SWORD
What rights the brave? The sword! What frees the slave? The sword! What smites in twain The tyrant's chain, And makes his gyves and fetters vain? The sword!
Chorus
Then cease thy proud task never While rests a link to sever! Guard of the free, We'll cherish thee, And keep thee bright forever!
What checks the knave? The sword! What smites to save? The sword! What wreaks the wrong Unpunished long, At last, upon the guilty strong? The sword!
What shelters wright? The sword! What makes it might? The Sword! What strikes the crown Of tyrants down, And answers with its flash their frown? The sword!
Still be thou true, Good sword! We'll die or do, Good Sword! Leap forth to light If tyrants smite, And trust our arms to wield thee right, Good Sword!
Chorus
Yes! cease thy proud task never While rests a link to sever! Guard of the free, We'll cherish thee, and keep thee bright for ever!
M.J. Barry - from "Song of The Sword and The Soldier"

territory was the islands at the mouth of the Rhine. He was in command of 50 ships of his father's fleet and his followers were called the Myrmidons (ants). During a military campaign into the land of the Trojans, the Achaeans destroyed a town of Troad and captured several beautiful women. Out of these, Achilles was presented with Briseis, a beautiful woman with whom he fell in love. In the early years of the war, he fought a single combat with the Amazon warrior chieftain Penthesileia. At the moment of her death, he looked into her eyes and was overcome with love for her. Achilles felt great sorrow at her passing and sang a lament at her funeral. Throughout the 10 years of the Trojan war, Achilles sacked so many cities of Troad that he struck fear into the Trojans more than any other Achaean warrior. For political reasons Achilles was forced to give up Briseis to Agamemnon, his superior. Achilles, who was described as a stubborn man with a volatile temper, pulled his troops out of battle in retaliation. The war began to go badly for the Achaeans so Patroclus, who was Achilles's best friend, donned Achilles's armor, borrowed his chariot, and led his troops into battle. As fate would have it, he was killed by a Trojan named Hector, a son of Priam. Achilles, hearing the news of his friend's death, went into a battle frenzy and slaughtered masses of Trojan warriors in revenge. When he found Hector, he chased him 3 times around the fort of Troy before killing him, then dragged his body back to his camp where he circled the bier of Patroclus. To further humiliate his enemies, he left Hector's body for the dogs until the old head chieftain Priam visited Achilles in his camp and begged him to return the body of his son. Achilles obliged the chieftain. Towards the end of the siege of Troy, Achilles was killed by an arrow that hit him in the heel, the only place that was unprotected by armor. The arrow was probably poisonous, as he died from the wound. Achilles was buried on the shores of the Hellespont (Netherlands). Odysseus and Ajax fought over his armor. His son Neoptolemus killed Priam, the Trojan chieftain, and abducted his daughter Polyxena whom his father had loved. On the way home with her, the god Achilles appeared and demanded the girl as a sacrifice.

When Achtan's time to give birth was near she collected her necessities and with her maid set off to her destination. As it was, the child was born on the way and his birth was accompanied by flashes of lightning and claps of thunder. From his raith, Lugna saw the lightning and heard the thunder and, knowing that his friend Art's child had been born, set out to find mother and child. When he reached their camp he was shocked to find only a distraught mother and her maid, because the child had been taken away by a wolf during the night. Lugna knew his foster was still alive and sent his warriors to search the area. A warrior named Grec found the child in a cave among the whelps of a she-wolf.

He came from a very troubled family that had the curse of the gods on them. He continued to aggravate the gods by killing a stag that was sacred to Artio and in revenge she becalmed the fleet he led to attack Troy. To appease the goddess, he sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia. Artio then spirited her away to the land of the Tauri where she trained as a druid. During a military campaign into the land of the Trojans, the Achaeans destroyed a town of Troad and captured several beautiful women. Out of these, Agamemnon was presented with Chryseis, a daughter of a priest to the sun god. During the 10th year of the war, a plague broke out in a camp of the Achaeans. It was believed that the plague was caused by the father of Chryseis in revenge for his daughter's abduction, so the Achaean army persuaded Agamemnon to return her to her people. Agamemnon then demanded Briseis, Achilles's consort. Achilles withdrew his troops in retaliation and the war began to go badly for the Achaeans. In an attempt to lure his best battle champion back to the conflict, Agamennon offered Achilles 7 towns: Aipeia (Eupen) east of Liège; Antheia (Anthée) west of Dinant; Cardamyle (Karden) on the Moselle River; Enope (Enneptal) on the Ruhr; Hire (Irrel) north of Luxembourg; Pedasus (Pedenberg) north of Duisburg; and Pherae (Vervier) east of Liège, all in the region of the lower Rhine. A bribe of 7 towns, great quantities of wealth and numerous women including Briseis still failed to bring back Achilles. Then fate intervened and Achilles' best friend Patroclus was killed by the battle champion Hector. This drove Achilles into a battle rage and he helped swing the tide of battle back to the Achaeans. The war ended in favor of the Achaean, and a victorious Agamemnon returned home with a new consort, Cassandra, daughter of Priam. On his arrival he was assassinated by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover. Agamemnon's son, Orestes, revenged his murder.

horses and when she turned he captured her. In exchange for not killing her, he extracted three promises from her. They were: that she and her sister would make peace, that she would bear his child and that she would train the child to be a mighty warrior. She agreed to this arrangement and Cu Chulainn stayed and trained with her until she bore him a son. Cu Chulainn told her to name the child Condlae and gave her his thumb ring. When the boy was old enough he was to be given the ring and sent out into the world with the geis that he was not to reveal his name to anyone should they ask. Aife also trained Ferdiad, Cu Chulainn's foster brother, and numerous other warriors.

He and his warriors then hunted, killed and ate her. Aige's brother Fafne was a poet and composed a satire which raised 3 blotches on the face of Meilge. Fafne's act was a serious offense because the high chieftain of Ireland had to be without physical blemishes or disfigurations. Fafne was captured and executed at the command of the high chieftain.

They were so insulted by this snub that they decided to take their services elsewhere and sailed to the territory of Lochlinners where they took service for a year and a day with Manus, the head chieftain of the Red Shields. The wife of the head chieftain fell in love with Ailbhinn and they all had to flee to escape her husband. The warriors of the Fianna decided to head to their summer hunting grounds and the head chieftain of Lochlinners followed with nine of his chieftains and their warriors. When Manus arrived at Dun Kincorry near the Hill of Howth, his champion Erragon waded into the Fianna with his sword. Ailbhinn was at the front of his warriors and he and the son of Leirr as well as 30 other Fianna lost their heads to the champion. Finally Goll, champion of the Fianna, challenged Erragon to combat. The two dragons of combat fought for 9 hours with mighty deeds and feats. In the end, Goll was the victor.

When the high chieftain of Ireland left for his tour of the five provinces of Ireland, Ailill was on his death bed. Believing the end had come, he confided in Etain and told of his love for her. Etain came each day and bathed his face and hands and cut his meat and in 3x9 days he was in good health again.

Now that Ailill was in better spirits he convinced Etain to make a tryst on the hill of Tara the next day. When the time came Ailill slept throughout the day and did not wake until evening. They again made a tryst to meet on the hill and again he slept throughout the day. The 3rd appointment to meet went the same way. When they finally discussed the matter, Etain told him that she had met him each day on top of the hill and had spent the day with him. It was then that Midhir, a deity of the Danann, appeared and told her that he had taken on the likeness of Ailill and had met with her on the hill. He had used his gifts to make Ailill fall in love with Etain and now he would reverse the process so that he would forget her.

REMARKS Ailill was born in Leinster, the son of Maga Muresc and Ross Ruad. Ailill had rights to the leadership of Connacht through his mother and grandmother. He was the only suitor that Medbh, Sovereign of Ireland, would accept. Medbh was the head chieftain of Connacht and her bride price was a chariot worth 21 slave women, a wedding ring the breadth of his face and made of red gold, silver bronze the weight of his left forearm (shield arm), and noble clothing for 12 men. Their union tied Leinster and Connacht together. Ailill was described as a tall red man wearing a diadem of gold on his head. He carried a hammered sword with a gold hilt in a scabbard of silver ornamented in gold. Before the Cualnge Cattle Raid he called on his uncles to help in the raid against Ulster. Cuillius was his charioteer during the cattle raid. Ailill congratulated himself on the Host of Connacht having laid waste to Cualnge, Ulster, the land of the Picts, from the end of summer until the beginning of spring. They captured the women, children, horses and herds, and he thought it was time to go to Raith Cruachain on Magh Ai in Roscommon to await the upcoming battle. At the end of the Cualnge Cattle Raid, Ailill made a 7-year peace with Ulster. Ailill killed Ferghus mac Roig while Ferghus was swimming with Medbh, in revenge for having an affair with his wife. Ailill's wife Medbh helped Conall Cernacht kill Ailill on a Beltainn with a spear while he was swimming, in revenge for his having killed Ferghus.

Desa / Ingcel REMARKS Da Derga was described as having red hair, ruddy cheeks and blue eyes with red eyebrows. He operated a hostel (bruidhean) on the Magh Liffey by Dodder river near present-day Dublin in the territory of Cua (Cualu). The hostel had 7 doors with 7 rooms, each between 2 doors, and there was a door-vent. The doors were always open unless they faced the wind, in which case they were shut. The hostel was also described as having 9 doors plus a doorvalve. In BC 38 there was a great battle or destruction at Da Derga's hostel (Bruidhean Dearg) between the high chieftain of Ireland and a force of raiders from Ireland and Britain. To get to the hostel, the invading army built hurdles across the river Liffey. This gave the name to the Town of the Hurdle Ford (Baile Atha Cliath) which was eventually built around the site. During the battle Da Derga was described as wearing a white hooded shirt and a green cloak and carrying a sword with an ivory handle. He had 3x50 personal warriors who were described as having long hair and wearing speckled green trousers and short cloaks to their buttocks. Their weapons were clubs of blackthorn with iron bands. Da Derga also had two attendants, Muredach and Corpre, who were his fosterlings and the sons of the head chieftain of Leinster. They served the guests of the hostel with ale and food. The cauldron of Da Derga's hostel was known to have been in continuous use since it first opened and was never taken from the fire. When Conaire became high chieftain of Ireland, he gave to Da Derga 100 kine, 100 swine, 100 mantles of close cloth, 100 blue-colored weapons, 10 red gilded brooches, 10 vats of ale, 10 slaves, 10 querns, 3x9 white hounds with silver chains and 100 race horses. When the high chieftain of Ireland and his entourage arrived at the hostel, Da Derga could not turn them away even though all the signs pointed to death and destruction. Da Derga and most of his bruidhean escaped the massacre. This story is similar to the invasion of Ireland by Bran and his army of Britons.

The Danann invaded Ireland on Beltainn and defeated the Firbolg during the first battle of Magh Tuireadh which was fought during the summer solstice. The Daghda was the spiritual leader of the Danann and mated with many war and earth goddesses of Ireland to ensure their success. In time, he became known as the Omnipotent God of Complete Knowledge. His mother was Danu, the eponymous goddess of the Danann, and his father was Eladu (fir), the tree of knowledge. Daghda could summon the seasons by playing his supernatural harp. The harp was stolen by Fomorians so, after the battle of north Moytura, Daghda, Lugh and Oghma followed the Fomorians to their camp and there on the wall of the banquet hall was his supernatural harp. Daghda called out to his harp: "Come apple-sweet murmurer, come four-angled frame of harmony, come summer, come winter, from the mouths of harps, bags, and pipes." At this command the harp flew off the wall of the hall to the hands of Daghda, killing 9 Fomorians on the way. The Daghda then played the 3 noble strains: Lament, Laughter and Slumber. When the Fomorians had fallen asleep, the 3 Danann made their escape. Daghda had a supernatural cauldron, a present from Lugh, whose contents satisfied all guests, a magical tree which continuously bore fruit and a black horse named Acein (ocean). Daghda had a supernatural club of oak that was so large he had to drag it on wheels. He could use one end to kill the living and the other end to revive the dead. When his son Cermat was killed by Lugh, Daghda used the club to resurrect him. On the eve of summer solstice before the second battle of Magh Tuireadh, Daghda met with The Morrighan (Danu) at the Unius river in Connacht. She was washing the blood from the clothing of the warriors who were to die in the upcoming battle. The Morrighan was dressed in red and her long red hair hung from her head in 9 loose tresses. She and the Daghda had intercourse while she straddled the river with one foot placed in the north and the other in the south. The site is still referred to as "The Bed of

the Couple". The Morrighan promised Daghda that she would take the blood from the heart of Indech, the Fomorian chieftain, and the valor from his kidneys. The Morrighan then gave Daghda two handsful of Indech's blood. The Daghda was then sent by Lugh to negotiate with the Fomorians in order to buy time and to spy on them in preparation for their upcoming battle. Daghda went to the Fomorians dressed as a fool with a short tunic that only reached his buttocks, a hood and cape which only came to his elbows and boots made of horsehide with the hair side out. He was forced to eat a porridge of meal mixed with goat, sheep, boar, 8 measures of milk and 8 measures of mead. They mixed the porridge in a hole in the ground lined with leather. They gave the Daghda a ladle large enough for a man and woman to lie in. He ate it all on pain of death, scraping the remainder out with his finger. Then, with a huge belly, he fell asleep. When he awoke and left the Fomorian camp, the daughter of Indech came to him. They performed ritual intercourse and she promised to turn her arts in favor of the Danann during the upcoming battle. During the 2nd battle of Magh Tuireadh, the Danann lost 3 female and 3 male chieftains and many warriors. Although Daghda was mortally wounded by the female warrior Ceithlenn in the battle, he succeeded Lugh as the head chieftain (oak god). Daghda served 80 years as head chieftain. After the battles of Taillcenn (Teltown) in Meath and Druim Lighean (Drumleene) in Donegal, the Danann were defeated by the invading Goidel. Daghda negotiated for the Danann and Amhairghin negotiated for the Goidel. Daghda allotted his chieftains the sidhes of Ireland, taking Uisneach Mide, the spiritual center of Ireland in the new province of Mide, as his home. Because MacGreine was dead, Daghda appointed Bodb Dearg as head chieftain of the Danann which rusulted in a civil war.

The druids had given a prophecy whereby he would be killed by a grandchild, so he imprisoned his daughter Danaë in a tower. Zeus, in a shower of gold, managed to reach her and impregnate her. When her son Perseus was born, she and her son were put in a wooden chest (boat) and given to the sea. Eventually they landed on the island of Seriphos (Ireland). Because the high chieftain of Seriphos was interested in marrying Danaë, he sent Perseus to Libya (southwestern France) to acquire the head of Medusa, which he did with the help of the goddess Athena. On his return home, Perseus saved Andromeda from being sacrificed to a sea monster by showing it the head of Medusa which turned it to stone. He and Andromeda were then married. He then proceeded to Seriphos where he showed Polydectes the head of Medusa and turned him into stone because he was mistreating his mother. Perseus then gave the head of Medusa to Athena. Next Perseus took his mother and wife to meet his grandfather Acrisius in Argos. Fulfilling the ancient prophecy, he accidentally killed his grandfather while playing quoits. He then took the position of high chieftain but later traded it for the position of high chieftain of Tiryns. Here he founded Mycenae (Troyes) which was later ruled by Agamemnon.

and moved to Argos (northern France) where he became head chieftain. The people of his territory were called Danaan (Danann/Danai) and by the time of the Trojan War, the name Danai referred to all the people of the territory. His 50 foster-daughters were called the Danaides and were promised to the 50 foster-sons of their uncle Aegyptus, but Danaus was afraid of a plot against him and asked the girls to kill their husbands on the wedding night. All of them did so except Hypermnestra, and as punishment they had to spend eternity in Hades pouring water into vessels with holes, symbolized by the springs and rivers of Argos.

Like her mother she was known for her expertise in the arts of combat and trained many of the Danann warriors. Danu's sexual character (life) was the link between her role as a mother goddess (birth) and a war goddess (death). As an earth goddess she resided at Sidhe Breg in Munster. Her daughters were known as The Cattle of Flidais. The hills near Killarney are often referred to as the Paps of Anu (Breasts of Danu), and Ireland is sometimes referred to as the Land of Anu. As blue is a sacred color to the bride or earth goddess, the woad plant was sacred to Danu. Danu was also known as as The Morrighan, a warrior who fought like a demon, spreading chaos and fear. During the battle of south Moytura she was referred to as the springs of craftiness and the sources of bitter fighting. She eventually became venerated as one of the 5 battle goddesses of Ireland along with Macha, Badbh, Fea and Nemhain and each had her own area of expertise. When mortals went to war the goddesses had to be appeased in order to have them on one's side. The Morrighan would sometimes appear as a spectre but mostly she favored the form of a large black raven. The whirlpool Corryvrecken, between Jura and Scarba Islands is sometimes referred to as Morrigan's Cauldron. The Morrighan sometimes appeared as a washer-woman washing the blood from the clothing of those warriors about to die in battle. This may have been an incentive to fight naked, as some did. The Morrighan's favor could sometimes be won over by sexual intercourse. The Daghda came across her while she straddled the river between the Danann and the Fomorii. He had intercourse with her so she helped the Danann win the war. The Morrighan was also someone not to cross, as Odras the Goidel cowherd found out when she tried to stop the Morrighan from taking her cows. The Morrighan appeared to Conaire in the form of a hag. In the form of a raven, she landed on a pillar stone in Cualnge and told the brown bull to move to Glenn na Samaisce (Heifers Glenn) in Sliab Culinn (Hollymount), northern Ulster. The brown bull took 50 heifers and Forgemen the Cowherd in order to escape capture from the Host of Connacht.

When the Morrighan approched Cu Chulainn at the river she had red hair and eyebrows. She was dressed in red and riding in her red chariot which was drawn by a huge ugly red horse with one leg. The chariot pole passed through the horse's body and came out through its forehead where it was held by a peg. Alongside the Morrighan was a crudelydressed man driving a red cow with a forked hazel stick. The Morrighan offered to help Cu Chulainn in return for sexual favors but he rejected her affection and sealed his fate. The Morrighan told Cu Chulainn that she had come with her treasures and her cattle because she loved him for his valor and great deeds. Cu Chulainn thought that a woman would weaken him at that particular time and refused her advances. She became angry and told Cu Chulainn that if he did not want her help then he would have her hindrance. The Morrighan interfered with Cu Chulainn 3 times while he was fighting for his life. The first time she interfered, she appeared as an eel that wound around his leg and tried to trip him. Cu Chulainn broke the eel's ribs with his toe and drove it away. The second time she appeared as a shaggy russet-furred wolf which drove a herd of cattle against him. Cu Chulainn put out an eye of the wolf with his sling and drove it off. The third time she appeared to Cu Chulainn she came disguised as a red heifer without horns. Cu Chulain broke a leg of the heifer and she retreated again. When Cu Chulainn was dying of thirst, an ancient oneeyed stooping hag with a limp came by leading a tawny milk cow with 3 teats. Cu Chulainn asked her for a drink of milk to quench his thirst and she gave him a drink straight from the teat. Cu Chulainn blessed her and the ancient hag straightened up. He then asked her if he might have another drink and she gave him milk from the 2nd teat. Cu Chulainn again blessed her and she looked at him with two good eyes. Cu Chulainn asked her if he could have just one more drink and she gave him milk from the 3rd teat. Cu Chulainn's thirst was quenched and he blessed her in the name of all the gods and non-gods. As she walked toward him he realized her limp was gone and that she was a young maiden of great beauty; in fact, she was the mighty Morrighan. Later when Cu Chulainn fought his final battle and had tied himself to the pillar stone, the Morrighan came in the form of a great raven and settled on his shoulder.

It was then drunk by a cow and was reborn as the Brown Bull of Cualnge. The bull was named after the district on the Carlingford Peninsula in the ancient province of Ulster and Forgeman was its herdsman (cowherd). The Brown Bull was a supernatural beast, being the reincarnation of a god of the Sidhe, and as he grew so did his fame. The bull would allow 50 youths to rest on his back in the evening to play draughts, assembly and leaping. Another virtue was that 100 warriors could be protected from the elements by his shadow or body heat. Goblins, boggarts or sprites would not come anywhere near him and his lowing was musical to the ear for anyone within hearing. Most important of his many virtues was that he would mount fifty heifers a day and they would calf within 24 hours or burst apart. Medbh, Sovereign of Connacht, desired the bull for her herd and sent MacRoth to negotiate a sale of the bull. She offered new land, a chariot and 50 heifers and the close friendship of herself, Sovereign of Connacht. Dare was

Upon hearing the insult, Dare refused the offer and sent the negotiators away. During the Cualnge Cattle Raid, Dare and his brothers were described as high-spirited youths, fiery and noble. They had their hair cut close to the head, wore sleeved tunics embroidered in red gold around their girth and over these they wore single-colored cloaks folded over them and held with gold fibulas. Each carried a shield, a goldhilted sword on his shoulder and a 5-pointed broad graygreen spear in his right hand. The Brown Bull, who was the object of the Bo Tain war, killed his enemy the Bull White Horn (Finnbhenach) and headed for home where he died at Druim Tairb (Bull's Back).

During a feast at which Aenchae, Sencha, Cathbad, Conchobar, Ferghus mac Roig and many of the heroes of Ulster were present, Deirdre let out a scream while she was still in her mother's womb. Cathbad prophesied a tall female of great beauty with golden hair, gray-green eyes, flawless skin and snow-white teeth. He also predicted that her great beauty would cause much hardship and many deaths among the Ulster warriors. The warriors wanted her put to death, but Conchobar said he would foster her and raise her away from everyone. She was fostered to a female filidh named Lebarcham and taken to a great woods of Ulster, never to see any man but Cathbad and Conchobar. One day, when she was reaching the age of marriage, Deirdre and Lebarcham were looking over the wall of their raith. It was winter and there was a new snow over the land. A spot was marked by the red blood of a newly-killed calf and as they were watching, a large black raven settled on the snow to eat the blood of the calf. When Deirdre saw this she cried out that she would like to see a man whose hair was as black as the raven, whose skin was as white as the newly-fallen snow and whose cheeks were as red as the blood of the newly-slain calf. Lebarcham told Deirdre that there was such a man: Naoise son of Usna, a young warrior of the Red Branch. Lebarcham arranged a meeting between Deirdre and Naoise and the young maiden fell madly in love with him. She did not want to marry Conchobar, whom she considered an old man, and tried to convince Naoise to help her to escape. One night Naoise and his two brothers came to the raith and rescued Deirdre, taking her and Lebarcham to Scotland where they became mercenaries for a head chieftain of the Picts. One night, the head chieftain tried to kill Naoise and his brothers so he could take Deirdre for himself, so the group moved on. Back in Ulster, the warriors wanted their brother of

the Red Branch back and were angry at Conchobar for forcing them to the wilderness because of a girl. Conchobar agreed to pardon them and sent Ferghus mac Roig to deliver the pardon. Naoise and his brothers were excited because they longed to see their comrades-at-arms and Emain Macha once again. Deirdre, on the other hand, perceived danger but was convinced by Naoise that no one including Conchobar would violate the protection of Ferghus. When Deirdre and her entourage landed in Ireland, they were met by Baruch, a Red Branch warrior who invited Ferghus to his raith for a feast. Ferghus could not refuse because it was a geis of his never to refuse an invitation to a feast. He put his sons Fiacha, Illann and Buinne in charge to safeguard the party to Emain Macha. Deirdre and her group arrived safely at Emain Macha and were housed at the Red Branch. Here Cathbad assured Naoise and his brothers that it was safe to leave the Red Branch hostel and he would guarantee their safety. Conchobar broke his promise, and warriors loyal to him commanded by Eoghan attacked the Red Branch. Naoise and his brothers and two of Ferghus's sons were some of the many killed in the fray. This black deed caused a split in the warriors of Ulster, and Ferghus led warriors loyal to him against Emain Macha and set it ablaze. He then left with his warriors for Connacht where they became mercenaries for Ailill and Medbh and fought a 17-year guerrilla war against Conchobar. Deirdre was no joy to Conchobar as she wept for her lost love. In anger Conchobar asked her what she hated most and she replied that she hated him and Eoghan, the killer of Naoise. Conchobar then told Eoghan that he could have Deirdre for a year and put her in his chariot. Before they went far Deirdre threw herself out of the chariot and dashed her head on a rock, killing herself. She was buried in a grave beside Naoise and in time yew trees grew from their graves and intertwined. They are said to be the yews at the great church of Armagh.

the master leech of the Danann when they invaded Ireland. When Nuadha, head chieftain of the Danann, lost his arm during the first battle of Magh Tuireadh, Diancecht replaced it with a silver hand made by Creidhne. Nuadha, now disfigured, could not remain the head chieftain of the Danann and was replaced by Bress. Diancecht's son Miach, who was also a physician, replaced Nuadha's silver hand with one of flesh and blood. This display of superior healing by his son made Diancecht so envious and jealous that he killed Miach. Diancecht replaced Midhir's eye that he had lost trying to settle a quarrel on the playing field of Bruig na Boinne. He wrote a thesis called the "Judgement of Dian Cecht" which dealt with the legal responsibilities of a person who had caused personal injury to another. During the battle of north Moytura, Diancecht and his children Miach, Ochttriuil and Airmid chanted spells over the sacred Spring of Health. Diancecht resurrected the dead and healed the wounded by immersing them into its well (Tiprait Slainge) which was located in Achad Aba (Ardagh) between Lough Arrow and Magh Tuiredh. Diancecht had filled the well with every herb that grew in Ireland so it was also called Loch Luibe. The well was destroyed when the Fomorian Octriallach led a raid by warriors who filled the well with stones from the Drowes river and built the Cairn of Octriallach. Diancecht died of painful plague, probably contacted from a poisoned weapon, during the battle of north Moytura.

"bright half". In Celtic mythology he was the son of Eperus, son of Tubal, son of Iafeth, and was the chieftain of the Epirotae on the Iberian Peninsula. His father seems to have been associated with the people of the same name from southern Albania, an area of the early Goidel. Dianos became the two-headed deity who guarded the entrance to The Land of the Dead in The Otherworld. Spain is also associated with this mythical place. Dianos was associated with the oak tree and the winter solstice which was the ending of the dark half and the beginning of the light half of the solar year. He was also associated with reincarnation and his head graced the pommel of many Celtic swords. Various Celtic sculptures of Dianos have been found: one from BC 6th century found at Holzerlingen, one of BC 4th century from Leichlingen, Germany and another found at Lothbury, England which also dates from BC 4th century. The Gauls had a temple dedicated to Dianos at Autun in Saône-et-Loire, France. The site was near the Arroux river and may have been a druidic center of learning. The site at one time was in the territory of the Sequani, who were settled there between BC 12th-8th century, and the Aedui tribe, who were settled in the area by BC 9th century. A sculpture of Dianos was found at Roquepertuse in southern France by the Rhône in the territory of the Vocontii, who settled there around BC 12th century. The territory was also settled by the Tricastini in BC 3rd century. The stone-carving style may have been influenced by the Ligurians (who were the original inhabitants) or by the later Iberian settlers, both of whom were excellent stone carvers. The Celts in Ireland venerated a sculpture of Dianos which is now in a small graveyard at the side of the road on Boa Island at Lough Erne in county Fermanagh, North Ireland. The style of carving is similar to that of the sculpture from Holzerlingen. The two-headed sculptures of Dianos are called Janiform and the god is often mistakenly credited to the Romans. Dianos predates the Romans and like most things Roman he was borrowed from another culture.

He was said to be fostered by the gods Anghus mac Og and Manannan of the Danann, meaning that he was fostered by their descendants. One day at a camp of the Fianna, Fionn's dogs were fighting amongst themselves. Diarmaid's half-brother hid between the knees of Donn for protection but Donn crushed him to death. The boy's father Roc used a magical wand to change the corpse into a gray-cropped white boar with no tail or ears. He gave him the same life-span as Diarmaid and the boar ran off to Beann Ghulban (Ben Bulben) in county Sligo to live his life. Diarmaid was given a geis not to hunt boar for his own protection. Diarmaid had a beauty spot (ball seirc) which made him irresistible to females once they saw it. He received the beauty mark from a goddess of youth when he, Oscar, Conan and Goll were out hunting. They spent the night in a cabin in the woods with an ancient man, his daughter, a wether sheep and a cat. During the evening meal, the cat jumped up onto the table and in turn each of the Fianna tried to remove it but failed. The ancient man explained to them that the cat was the symbol of death and none of them was stronger. That night each of the males tried to entice the maiden to sleep with him but only Diarmaid succeeded and she put her mark on him. Diarmaid was considered to be the 3rd best warrior of the Fianna. Diarmaid and Oscar were the best of friends and Diarmaid, the older, taught Oscar how to play Taileasg. One night at a feast held in honor of Fionn's marriage to Grainne, daughter of the high chieftain of Ireland, Diarmaid's love spot got him into trouble. Grainne did not want to be married to Fionn and she used Diarmaid's geis (always to help a maiden in trouble) to rescue her from this fate. Diarmaid loved his uncle and his life with the Fianna and did not want to elope with her but he had no choice. The two ran away to the forest of Ireland and at first

he left symbols so that Fionn would know that they were not sleeping together, but as time went on they fell in love. A cave named Ui Fiacrach Aidhne in the hills of Kenavarra at the western end of Tiree in the Inner Hebrides became known as the Bed of Diarmuid and Grainne. While they were being hunted by the Fianna, the couple entered the forest of Duvnos in which there was a magical rowan tree which produced berries of immortality. The tree was guarded by a giant called Searbhan the Surly. Diarmaid convinced the giant to allow them to hide in the tree on condition that they would not touch the berries. They agreed, but then Grainne complained of her hunger and wanted to eat some. This situation forced Diarmaid to kill the giant. The couple spent 16 years living off the land in Ireland and Scotland and having many adventures before Anghus mac Og and Grainne's father, the high chieftain of Ireland, put enough pressure on Fionn to allow them to come back to Tara. The couple returned to live in Raith Grainne at Tara, and Grainne bore four sons and a daughter by Diarmaid. While there, Grainne convinced Diarmaid to invite Fionn to a festival. One night during Fionn's stay, Diarmaid was woken by hounds of the Danann howling in the distance. In the morning he found Fionn and some of the Fianna ready to go on a boar hunt. Diarmaid was under geis not to hunt boar so he went along only as an extra. When the white boar of Ben Bulben had been killed, Fionn asked Diarmaid to measure it from snout to tail. Diarmaid realized it was his half-brother and while measuring out the 16-foot boar, he was stabbed in the sole of his foot (his only vulnerable spot) by a poisonous bristle. As Diarmaid lay dying, he asked Fionn for a drink of water from his hands because only this could save his life. Fionn said there was no spring in the area and Diarmaid pointed out that he was lying only 9 paces from a spring with the best water in the area. Fionn attempted to bring him water, but each time he remembered the pain Diarmaid had caused him, the water slipped through his fingers. Fionn's son Oscar, who was Diarmaid's best friend, threatened his father with his life if he did not bring Diarmaid a drink. Fionn brought a 3rd handful of water to Diarmaid but he was already dead. Anghus mac Og and his people of the Danann appeared on Ben Bulben and wailed over the death of Diarmaid, then carried away his body on a gilded bier to Sidhe Brugh na Boyna on Magh mBreg in Mide. Grainne then sent her sons abroad to learn the arts of combat so they could avenge their father's death but as time went on, Fionn wooed her. Much to the disgust of the Fianna, Grainne married Fionn and made peace between him and her sons.

Mane, a son of Ailill and Medbh, represented the Connacht host and Diarmait told him that Conchobar wanted the Brown Bull and his cattle back, plus restoration for the damage done. Because Medbh had pledged a meeting of the bulls, she could bring the White Bull to Cualnge. Mane delivered the message but Medbh and Ailill refused all conditions. When Mane delivered the reply, Diarmait suggested that they exchange spears. They both died along with 3 score of each side.

When Diarmuid became the high chieftain, Ireland was inundated with such hailstorms that 12 new streams were created. Diarmuid was one of the last great pagan rulers of Ireland and during his rule The Feast of Feis Temhra (ritual marriage between the high chieftain and the earth goddess of Mide) was still being practiced. He ordered the stories of Oisin and Caoilte to be cut into the poet staffs (Tamhlorgaibh Fileadh). Diarmuid killed two head chieftains of Leinster over the cattle tax (Boramha Tribute). After that he extracted the tax without a fight. While Diarmuid was high chieftain of Ireland, a legal representative of the court of Tara was murdered by a chieftain named Hugh Guairy. Diarmuid sent officers to arrest Hugh Guairy for the murder he had committed, but he was hidden away by the clergy of a new religion that was aggressively trying to defeat the established religion in Ireland at the time. Diarmuid had the premises searched and the murderer was brought to justice at Tara. The clergy of the new religion gathered at Tara and laid a curse upon it, but it failed and Tara continued to be used as a site for pagan rituals as late as AD 780. Diarmuid found that his wife was having an affair with Flann mac Dima, and on the eve of Beltainn attacked his raith on the Plain of Uisneach. While it was ablaze, Flann suffocated in a vat of water where he climbed to escape the flames. Diarmuid asked his druids how he would meet his own death. The first filidh said he would die from slaughter while he was wearing a shirt made from the single flax seed and a mantle made from the wool of one sheep. The second filidh said Diarmuid would die from drowning in a vat of beer made from a single seed of grain. The third filidh said Diarmuid would die from burning after eating the bacon of a swine that was never farrowed.

In return for Cu Chulainn's help, Labhraidh offerred him the hand of Fand. Li Ban returned with Cu Chulainn's charioteer Laeg so that he could do a reckoning of Magh Mell, Labhraidh's territory, which was an island in a lake. When Laeg returned to Cu Chulainn, he described Labhraidh as having long blond hair held back by a golden apple. In the garden of Labhraidh was a house that could hold 150 warriors, purple trees with beautiful songbirds, fruit trees that could bear enough fruit to feed 300 warriors, a supernatural well and a vat of intoxicating mead that never went dry. The island was also visited by troops of women. Cu Chulainn came to Magh Mell and Labhraidh put him in charge of his army and made him his champion. During the

battle with the Fomorians, Cu Chulainn killed Eochaidh Iuil and 30 of his warriors. The Fomorian chieftain Senach Siabarthe attacked next and he also was killed by Cu Chulainn. Labhraidh and his army, which had been held in reserve, then attacked and together they routed the remainder of their enemies including Manannan and his warriors who fought for Eogan Indber of the Fomorians. Cu Chulainn had to be cooled in three vats of water so that he would not turn his anger against his friends.

When Cobhthach poisoned Labraid's father, he cut out his heart and made Labraid eat it. The horror of the expierence caused the boy to lose his voice and he became known as Moen (dumb). Labraid fled from Ireland to the land of the Pretani where he served as a mercenary to the chieftain of the Armenia, a tribe who decorated their hair with flecks of gold. After some time passed, Labraid travelled on to Gaul to see if he could make use of his great-grandmother's connections. At the suggestion of his poet Ferchertne, he sailed to Aremorica and met Scoriath, the head chieftain of the Fir Morc. While Labraid was playing hurley one day, he was hit with a stick which made him yell out, thereby regaining his speech. Scoriath had a beautiful daughter named Moriath



Chapter 14 - G/H/W - L
771
who fell in love with Labraid and they eventually married. With the help of his father-in-law, Labraid raised an army and set sail for Dinn Rig. When they approached the shore, Cobhthach's druid asked the first ship if the leader could speak and the reply was "Yes, he is Labraidh Loineach (the mariner who speaks)" which was a play on his name. Labraid landed at Wexford with his army of Gaesatae (battle-line) which was made up of Galian and Luaighni warriors of the Cauci and Menapii tribes. They carried spears with blue-green iron heads called Laighne (Lyna). Labraid and his warriors seized control of Dinn Rig and called the territory Laighin {Ly-in} which became known as Leinster. Labraid spent a year secretly building a special iron house. On the eve of Samhain a great feast was held. Cobhthach and his chieftains who had survived the battle were invited as the guests of honor. They were tricked into entering the iron house which was then set afire and they were roasted alive. With the death of Cobhthach, Labraid became the high chieftain of Ireland. Labraid could hear everything that was happening around him, even if it was whispered, because he had horse's ears. He wore his hair so his people would never see his disfigurement. Every time he had his hair cut, he would have the barber killed in order to keep the secret. One barber managed to tell the tree he was hanged on before he died. Eventually a branch of the tree was cut off and made into a harp for Craiphtine. The first time Craiphtine played the harp, it told of Labraid's horse ears. Labraid spent 19 years as the high chieftain of Ireland before he was slain by Melge, son of Cobhthach, who became the next high chieftain. He ruled the island for 17 years until he was killed by Mug Corb, son of Rechtaid Rigderg of Mumu. Labraid's son Oengus Ollom also served 18 years as the high chieftain of Ireland until he was killed by Irereo, son of Melge.

Laeg was the charioteer and good friend to Cu Chulainn and could operate in a close proximity when Cu Chulainn was in his warrior's heat. He always called Cu Chulainn "Cucuc". Laeg was described as a slender, tall man with curly red hair and a freckled face. Laeg and Cu Chulainn shared many adventures, and Laeg had to fight in some of the battles himself. He fought his brother Id, charioteer of Ferdiad, during the combat between Cu Chulainn and Ferdiad at Ath Ferdiad. He also fought Mulcha, Lethan's charioteer. When Cu Chulainn had been cured by his god-father Lugh and had awoken from his 3-day healing sleep, he was told of the slaughter of the boy-troop of Ulster and their leader Follomain. Follomain and the troop of 3x50 warrior youths had been under Cu Chulainn's protection and now they were all dead. Cu Chulainn told Laeg to prepare his battle chariot and to attach the scythes to the wheels, then to prepare

the horses and himself. The battle chariot was a heavy war chariot covered with sharp points and barbs so that it resembled a charging porcupine. The scythes were long blades that were parallel extensions of the wheel. They spun around as the wheel turned, causing considerable damage to the lower parts of animals and humans. Laeg then prepared the horses: the Black of Saingliu and the Gray of Macha. He dressed them in their coats of armor and iron chain mail and attached them to the battle chariot. Laeg next put on his charioteer's battle dress with his tunic of buckskin and a cape of raven feathers over it. He wore his multi-colored battle-cap which was covered in figures. The battle-cap protected his shoulders and back and was fitted with a crest on the top. He then placed the strip of red-gold over his forehead which was his badge of charioteering. He took the hobbles off the horses, and with his golden goad in his right hand and the reins in his left, he drove over to pick up his master, Cucuc. Cu Chulainn was dressed in his battle armor of 27 waxed tunics girdled by cord, swathings and ropes. This was to protect himself when he became deranged by his riastarthae. Over this he wore his champion's battle girdle made from the forequarters of 7 young oxen. The girdle covered the area from under his armpits to the narrow of his waist. He then wore his silken trews with bands of golden plates against the soft parts of his loins. Over this he wore another battle girdle of cowhide. The next layer was a hide kilt made from the shoulders of 4 oxen. This protected him from the narrow part of his waist to the thick part of his legs. Cu Chulainn then loaded his battle chariot with his favorite weapons of war. He took with him 1 tusk-hilted long sword, 8 little swords, 1 quiver of 8 small spears, 1 five-pronged spear, 8 little darts, 1 javelin, 8 small shafts, 1 play-staff, 8 shields for feats and his dark red curved shield with its keen cutting edge of hard iron. Cu Chulainn then put on his crested four-cornered war helmet with a carbuncle at each corner and placed his purple fan over his face. He then put a cloak of invisibility over himself, his charioteer and his horses: a talent he had learned from his foster-father Manannan. Cu Chulainn then let out a warrior's yell that shook the very fabric of the earth and air around him, alerting the fiends, goblins and spirits of the coming slaughter. His body took on the contorted shape of his riastarthae, shifting bone and muscle. One eye was sucked into his head and the other grew to 5 times its normal size. His mouth opened from ear to ear, his hair bristled and his champion's light stood out on his forehead. In this monstrous state, he then mounted his war chariot and was driven to the camp of the Host of Connacht. Laeg manouevered the war chariot through the hoard of enemy warriors while Cu Chulainn delivered his thunder-feat

of 100, the thunder-feat of 200, the thunder-feat of 300, the thunder-feat of 400, until he reached the thunder-feat of 500. Laeg then drove the chariot in a large circle around the Host of Connacht, pushing the earth into a high wall (the hedge of Badbh) so that they could not escape. He then rode 6 times in a spiralling circle through the warriors of Connacht, with the scythes piling the slaughtered mutilated corpses onto a bed of six rows. Sessrech Breslige (Great Sixfold Slaughter) was the name of this massacre. Laeg then drove off the battlefield without having any wounds or injuries to his master, his horses or himself. Before the Battle of Gairech & Irgairech, Cu Chulainn had Laeg awaken the warriors of Ulster. Laeg reported to Cucuc that they went into battle naked (without armor) except for their weapons. Laeg also sailed with Li Ban to Mag Mell (Plain of Delight) of The Otherworld in a bronze boat to inspect the beauty of Fand. He then returned with Cu Chulainn to recover Fand's territory in The Otherworld. Laeg, the Black of Saingliu, Cu Chulainn and the Gray of Macha all died on the same day. Laeg was killed by a javelin that was especially made by the sons of Calatin to kill a champion. Lugaid mac Curoi was the warrior who threw the javelin. Laeg, the greatest of charioteers, was dead.

The followers of Refloir refused to be led by Agnomain and drove the children of Nel out of the territory. Agnomain secured 3 ships and put 20 female and 40 male warriors in each. After 7 years of searching the north side of the Caspian Sea looking for a way to the great ocean, Agnomain died. The 3 ships were now led by Allot, Cing and Caicher the druid, all under the head chieftain Lamfind. The Goidel travelled from Eastern Albania (Dagestan), a territory situated north of the Caucasus on the Caspian Sea, to the Euxine River (Strait of Kerch). The druid Caicher advised that when they should pass through the waters of the Sirens they could wax their ears for protection. Here north of the Rhipaean mountain they found a spring with water that tasted like wine. After 3 nights of rest they pushed onward to the Maeotic Marshes (Sea of Azov).

Lugaid went to the camp of Cu Chulainn and told him of Medbh's plan. When Larine arrived for battle in the early morning with his wagon of weapons, he was not accompanied by the usual array of warriors to watch the combat. The only followers he had were 3x50 women, boys and girls who went to jeer at him. Cu Chulainn had decided not to bring any weapons to the encounter and when Larine arrived, Cu Chulainn rushed him and knocked his weapon away. Then he grabbed Larine in a bear hug and shook him until the air was fouled by his waste. Cu Chulainn then threw him with all his might and he landed at the door of Lugaid's tent.

He and 3x50 boys sat on blue-silver chairs. Le Fer Flaith carried 15 darts made from the stocks of bullrushes with thorns for heads.

Conchobar sent Lebarcham to fetch Cu Chulainn for the Samhain festival at Emain Macha which led to the drunken ride to Temair Luachra. During another Samhain celebration, Lebarcham suggested to Cu Chulainn that he capture some birds for the women to wear on their shoulders. Cu Chulainn was angry because of the frivolousness of the deed until she reminded him that many of the women blemished themselves by going around with one eye closed in imitation of him when he was in his riastartha. The situation led to him trying to shoot down two Danann goddesses, Fand and Li Ban, who were disguised as birds. Lebarcham was the filidh whom Conchobar appointed to oversee the upbringing of Deirdre who would be his concubine when she was old enough. They lived in seclusion away from males with their female servants and Deirdre's maidens in a great wood of Ulster. One day when Deirdre was reaching womanhood and pining for a handsome man, Lebarcham told her of Naoise, a youth of raven-black hair, blood-red cheeks on snow-white skin. Deirdre immediately fell in love and demanded to meet this Red Branch warrior. When they finally met, Deirdre used her charms to persuade Naoise to take her away from her dreary life. Naoise and Deirdre eloped to Albainn (Scotland/northern England) where

Naoise and his brothers hired out as mercanaries and lived a life of youthful adventure. When Conchobar was forced by the warriors of the Red Branch to allow Deirdre and Naoise to return to Ulster, Conchobar sent for Lebhoecham and asked if Deirdre was still beautiful. Lebarcham spoke of her bad points and tried to convince Conchobar that Deirdre had lost her looks. The situation eventually led to the the civil war of Ulster. Years later when Cu Chulainn prepared for his death ride, Lebarcham begged him not to go and instigated 3x150 women to keen, lament and hit their hands in protest that they would not see him again.

During his reign he founded Caerleir (Leir's fort) on a tributary of the Soar river where present-day Leicester now stands. Leir had three daughters and when he became older he asked his daughters how much they loved him. Goneril and Regan, the two oldest, flattered the old man and were married off to two important chieftains with dowries of huge sections of Britain. Cordelia, who was his favorite daughter and who loved him the most, refused to answer such a silly question. The old man became angry and refused her a dowry, but she was allowed to marry a chieftain of Gaul. Not long after, the two elder daughters conspired and divided his territory between themselves. Leir was maintained by his elder daughter Goneril and was allowed to keep a retinue of 140 warriors, which were soon reduced to 30. Leir appealed to his second daughter Regan, who took him in but reduced his retinue to 5 warriors. This was a major insult to the once-powerful chieftain so he returned to live with Goneril who added insult to injury by reducing his retinue to 1. Leir, highly insulted, sailed to Gaul to visit his youngest daughter and there he was treated with the dignity he deserved. Cordelia outfitted her father with fine clothing that befitted his status and provided him with an army to recapture his territory. When Leir died, his daughter Cordelia buried him in a chamber under the Soar river downriver from Leicester and dedicated the chamber to Dianos, god of the portal.

When the time came for the women to make their grand entrance to the feast, the three wives of the champions and their 3x50 maidens began their procession slowly and with great dignity. As they came closer to the entrance they each began to hurry so they would be the first to enter. When each realized that the other was also trying to get there first, all three hiked their dresses to their hips and ran. Sencha realized that Bricriu was behind this and ordered the guards to close the door. Outside the door the women began a war of words as they praised their husbands.

Li Ban and her sister Fand changed themselves into birds and flew to the lake at Magh Muirthemni where Cu Chulainn was holding a Samhain festival. Cu Chulainn, against the wishes of his wife Emer, slung stones at the birds and grazed one. Later when he had fallen asleep sitting against a rock, he had a vision of two women approaching him. One wore a green cloak with five folds and the other wore a red cloak. They began to beat him with horsewhips and he went into a coma-like state that lasted for a year. On the following Samhain after her brother Aeonghus had cured Cu Chulainn, Li Ban arrived at Magh Muirthemni and made this proposal to Cu Chulainn: if he would help Labhraidh in his fight against his enemies, he would be rewarded with the love of Fand who had been deserted by Manannan. Li Ban took Laeg to the far side of the lake looking toward the island and they were met by a bronze boat that took them to the island and on to Magh Mell in The Otherworld.

When Daghda allotted his chieftains the sidhes of Ireland, Lir was given Sidhe Fionnachaidh on Slieve Fuad (Sliabh Fuait), close to present-day Newtonhamilton in county Armagh. When the Daghda appointed Bodb Dearg as the new head chieftain, Lir sided with Midhir during the civil war that followed. The main chieftains involved in the war were Bodb Dearg, Ilbhreach, Lir, Midhir, Ochall Ochne and Fionnbharr, who replaced Manannan after his death. When the civil war was over, Bodb Derg tried to make amends with Lir by suggesting that he marry one of his foster-daughters who were daughters of Ailill of Aran. Lir chose Aebh because she was the oldest of the three and, he hoped, the wisest. She died giving birth to their second set of twins and Lir was very sad until Bobd Dearg convinced him to marry again and he chose Aoife, the next oldest sister. Lir and Aoife were happy for a while and she was a good mother to her sister's children but she then started to become jealous of the attention they received, so she turned them into swans and cursed them to remain in that

He convinced his troops that the Romans had killed two Ædui chieftains named Eporedorix and Viridomarus and that they should attack Romans wherever they found them. After his trick was exposed, Litaviccus went to the Aedui stronghold of Bibracte where he convinced the Ædui vergobret (magistrate) Convictolitavis and other Ædui chieftains to raise troops to help Vercingetorix fight the invading Romans. They all made treaties with Vercingetorix and sent troops to help him at the fortress Gergovia. Eporedorix and Viridomarus arrived at the Ædui stronghold of Noviodunum and heard that their tribe was rebelling against the Romans. They killed the Roman guards and civilians at the fort, set Caesar's hostages free to return to their different tribes and recovered their stolen goods from the Romans. Litaviccus continued to fight skirmishes, recruited warriors to help Vercingetorix and disrupted the Roman grain supply and baggage trains.

RELATIVES Cymidei Cymeinvoll (wife); Lassar (son) ENEMIES Matholwch SEE ALSO Bran / Cassubellaunos / Cymidei Cymeinvoll / Matholwch REMARKS Llassar Llaes Gyfnewid was a supernatural being from The Otherworld who emerged from the Lake of the Cauldron. He was a giant of man with yellow-red hair carrying a cauldron and followed by his wife who was even larger than he was. Matholwch the high chieftain of Ireland was present when they appeared and agreed to support them for 16 months. As time went on, the couple and their children became a burden so he decided to rid Ireland of them. Matholwch built an iron house and invited Llassar and his family to a feast. When all had drunk their fill and had fallen asleep, Matholwch had the iron house covered with charcoal and fired white-hot. Llassar and his wife used their incredible strength to break a hole through the wall and escaped with the cauldron to Wales but lost their children in the iron house. Bran granted the two sanctuary in exchange for the supernatural cauldron. The cauldron had the gift of reviving the dead although it left them speechless. In Wales, the couple prospered and produced many fine warriors. They forged the best weapons and Llassar proved to be a master saddle-maker renowned for his system of coloring the saddlehorn with blue enamel (Azur Chaulk), a process called "Calch Llassar". Llassar and Cymidei had a son named Lassar who was one of the Seith Marchawg (7 horsemen) left to protect Wales when Bran and his warriors invaded Ireland. He was killed by the Belgae chieftain Cassubellaunos when he invaded Wales.

between the territories and spoke through a copper tube to keep their conversation from being overheard by the Corainied who were one of the pests. The tube was infested with a demon who twisted their words but pouring wine through the tube cured the problem. Llevelys then explained to his brother that the 3 pests or plagues of England were: the Corainied who could hear every whisper, two dragons that fought every Beltainn Eve, and a giant who was robbing his larder after using his sorcery to put everyone to sleep. Llevelys explained how Lludd could solve his problem, then sailed back to Gaul.

His mother Arianrod was the moon goddess and would have nothing to do with Llew because he was conceived by rape. Because they were of the Danann, it was the mother's privilege to supply the child with a name, weapons and a wife. Llew's father Gwyddion tricked Arianrod into giving Llew a name by disguising himself and his son as shoemakers and visiting Arianrod at her rath. Arianrod saw Llew pin a wren to the boat with an arrow without killing it. She asked who was the lion with the skillful hand and thus the boy was named. When it was time for Llew to be armed, Gwyddion took him to Arianrod's raith Caer Sidin disguised as bard. Gwyddion used his sorcery to create the illusion that Arianrod's raith was under attack. Arianrod armed everyone including her son only to find that she had been tricked into arming Llew and that her fortress was not under attack.

Because Arianrod had cursed Llew never to have a wife of any known race that inhabited the earth, Math set about to create one for him. With the help of his student Gwyddion, they welded the flowers of oak, broom and meadowsweet and produced a maiden that was the most beautiful of all. She was named Blodeuedd and the two were married. Math gave Llew the Cantref of Dinoding (Eifynydd / Ardudwy) to rule over from Mur Castell. Llew and his wife Blodeuedd lived happily and were loved by his people until, by chance, Blodeuedd met a young noble while he was hunting in their territory. Unknown to Llew, they began plotting to dispose of him. Llew had to be tricked into revealing his vulnerability because as a solar deity he was almost impossible to kill. As it turned out, Llew could be killed by a special spear that was forged during the special sacrificial days and took a year in the making. Llew could be killed neither inside nor outside a house; neither on horseback nor on foot; neither standing in water nor on dry land; neither naked nor clothed. One day, Blodeuedd tricked Llew into standing in a vulnerable situation and out from a hidden position came Gronw with the supernatural spear that he threw at Llew. The spear with its poisonous head sank into Llew's body. Llew let out a scream, changed into an eagle and flew off. Gwyddion found him by following a sow until it stopped beneath a tree beside a brook now called Nant y Llew. Gwyddion knew that the dying eagle was his son and beckoned him close so he could touch him with his wand. Llew changed back into his human shape and was taken to Caer Dathl where he was healed back to his former strength. Llew and Gwyddion went to take vengeance on his wife and her lover. After the ordeal was over, Llew invited the people of Gronw's territory to join with his, which they did.

During his time, England was plagued by 3 pests: the Corainied, a people who could hear every whisper on the breeze; a horrible scream that was heard every Beltainn Eve that would cause the crops to fail to grow and make the cows go barren; and the mysterious disappearance of all food from the larder every night. Lludd was perplexed about how to resolve the situation and sent a message for help to his brother Llevelys, a head chieftain in Gaul, to meet him in the channel between the two territories. The brothers spoke through a copper tube so that their conversation could not be overheard by the Corainied. The tube was infested with a demon who twisted the words of the two brothers and they were ready to fight until wine was poured down the tube to cure the problem. Lludd returned with poisonous insects given to him by his brother. He ground the insects and sprinkled them over the assembly of people. Because his own people were immune to them, only the Corainied died. The horrible scream was coming from the dragon of Britain who was fighting off a foreign dragon. Lludd dug a pit in the center of Belgic Britain near present-day Oxford. In the pit he placed a vat of beer and covered it with a sheet. When the monsters fought long enough they changed into the shape of two wild boars and settled onto the sheet where they sank into the vat and became drunk on the mead. He then trapped them in the sheet and took them to Wales and at Dinas Ffaraon Dandde (Flaming Pharaoh), which later became known as Dinas Emrys, they were buried in a stone chamber (tumulus). The third pest that was plaguing England was a giant who cast a spell over the raith, then stole all the food from the larder. Lludd stayed awake by submerging his head continuously into a vat of cold water. When the giant appeared, Lludd fought him and beat him by force and the giant swore that he would be Lludd's most loyal subject. During his rule, Lludd captured Trinovantum, the center of the Trinovantes tribe, and renamed it Caer Lludd (Lludd's fort) or Lludd-din (Lludd's city). The name slowly evolved as Lundein and eventually London. He also built a sun temple on the top of a hill. He was buried there and it was called Parth Ludd (Ludgate Hill). After his death, Cassubellaunos became the head chieftain of the Belgic tribes because the children of Lludd were too young to rule.

Manawyddan captured Llywd's wife while she and some of Gwawl's warriors were stealing the grain from Rhiannon's land in the disguise of mice. This was in revenge for the way Gwawl had been made a fool of when they used him to play Badger in the Bag after Rhiannon rejected Gwawl for Pwyll.

CALENDARS
The Celtic solar year was called the circle of Baal (Bealaine/Bliadhain) and was divided into halves. The first half (waxing half) of the year began at dusk on winter solstice. Already the longest night and the shortest day have passed. The second half (waning half) of the year began at dusk of summer solstice. Already the shortest night and the longest day have passed. The solar year was then quartered by the equinoxes (days of balance) when night and day are of equal length. These four important solar events were represented by four spokes of the solar calendar. The time between the solar events was again subdivided by four calendar events which were represented by the other four spokes of the solar wheel. The Celtic day was also divided into two halves. The first half (dark half) of the day began at dusk and the second half (light half) of the day began at dawn with high noon as its point of balance. A Celtic lunar/solar calendar was found in France at Coligny near Bourg-en-Bresse. The site was in the border zone of the Sequani and the Ambarri tribes who both settled the area around BC 6th century. The calendar was found with artifacts including a bronze statue believed to have been part of a temple where the calendar plaque was mounted for public use. The time that the calendar was in use is thought to have been between BC 3rd - AD 1st century. The script and numbers on the calendar are Roman and the language is Brythonic Celt. Alban Wall, Stonehenge and the Calendar of Coligny, asserts that it contains no Roman or Greek elements and, like Stonehenge, is based on a 19-year moon/sun cycle. Pliny (AD 1st c), Stonehenge and the Coligny calendar all present evidence that the Celts began their month on the 6th day of the moon, which is the waxing half or 1st quarter, the day of balance. The Coligny calendar had 16 columns showing 62 lunar months plus two additional intercalary months, giving it a 19-year cycle. The month was divided into a bright half of 15 days with the 3-day full moon at the center. The dark half had 14-15 days with the new moon at its center. The British and Portuguese, among others, still use the fortnight/15 days as a measurement of moon-time. The first half of the moon-month had maximum light and the second half had maximum darkness. The second half of the moon

calendar was called Atenoux or Athnugud (renewal). Some of the days and months of the Colingy calenday were marked good (Mat) or bad (Anm). The Celts believed even into recent time that people born in the night could see ghosts and phantoms which could not be seen by people born during the daylight hours. The Celtic tree calendar as presented by Robert Graves, The White Goddess, divided the year into 13 months. The tree year began in December just after the solstice with the month of Beth, represented by the self-propagating birch tree that was used to drive out the spirit of the old year. The oldest zodiac was the lunar zodiac with 28 houses or stations in which the moon could be seen. As the moon goddess lost in importance to her son it was overshadowed by the solar zodiac. The Saros cycle of the lunar calendar synchronizes with the sun every 18.03 solar years. Stonehenge has a lunar aspect and there is an interesting lunar calendar called Sagres ("sacred") in southern Portugal at Cabo de São Vincente. North America, especially in the province of Alberta, has many lunar calendars called medicine wheels. The solar zodiac calendar begins at the vernal equinox which is the day of balance in the waxing half of the sun year and the beginning of the bright half of the solar year. The sun and moon both move west to east in relationship to the movement of the stars. The solar zodiac calendar is regulated by the constellation in a band which is 8o on either side of the elliptic path followed by the earth and its moon as the planet orbits the sun. The band is divided into 12 equal sections called signs or houses and starts with the sun's position at the vernal equinox. The modern-day zodiac was standardized by Hipparchus in BC 2nd century with Aries at the vernal equinox. Before this time the starting constellation was Taurus. The ancients did not use the zodiac to predict the complicated future events for individuals; such a concept is relatively modern. It has been suggested that the Celts used a 13-month calendar. The constellation Libra, which is the house before Scorpio, was not used before BC 300 but the constellation Ophiuchus (Serpent Holder) was in use and fell between the houses of Scorpio and Sagittarius. The naming of the constellations had more to do with the mythology they told than with the physical appearance of the star configurations. In late September, the sunset and moonrise coincide for several days in the northern hemisphere and this is the time of the full moon called Harvest Moon. The winter moon rises earliest and sets latest while the sun rises latest and sets earliest. Stonehenge is probably best known as a solar calendar but it was also an excellent lunar calendar. The two calendars are in synchronicity every 19 years and the

bluestone horseshoe was used to keep track of the cycle. The end of the 19-year cycle would see the conjunction of full moon and winter solstice sunset. The moon would rise over the heelstone as the sun set through the arch of the Great Trilithon. The Greeks called the people who built and interpreted the calendars at Stonehenge Hyperborian (people of the north). They reported that these people used wheat straw in their rites to the sun god who visited them every 19 years on the great year. He visited them from the time of the vernal equinox and played his harp until the Pleiades rose (in Taurus) before leaving again. The Celts have used constructions such as Stonehenge, Aubrey Circle, mountain ridges such as Edderton in Scotland, the calendar of Coligny and medicine wheels in America and Iberia to track the stars, sun, moon and other planets so as to divine the calendar events of the future.

NAME Winter Solstice ALTERNATIVE An-fheill-shlinnein (great shoulder-borne feast-day) TYPE sun event PURPOSE death of the old / birth of the new DATE Giamonios (Dec) 21-22 / (2-day festival) DEITY Artio / Caer Ibormeith / Dianos / Belenos SYMBOL D / oak club / bull RITES bonfire / cider / veneration of nature REMARKS Winter solstice is the shortest day of year and follows the longest night. The solstice was a 2-day event for the Celts at which they mourned the death of the old sun god and celebrated the birth of the new sun god. The 2 days of minimum light were helped by lighting black (old sun) and gold (new sun) candles. A moon goddess such as Caer Ibormeith (yew) presided over this event. The first day of this event was concerned with the death of the sun god of the waning half of the year. He was associated with the holly tree and the lynx. The day began on the eve of winter solstice and continued until the sun's life was extinguished at the end of solstice. The color of that day was black. A needfire of elder, the death tree, was lit on the eve of winter solstice and sacrifices were made throughout the day as the solemn event took place. Only simple meals such as round oatcakes were eaten, washed down with a little water. The eve of the 1st day of the waxing half of the year was more hopeful, with the preparation of a feast and veneration to the Great Mother (moon). Trees were ornamented and homes were decked out with scarlet berries from plants such as mistletoe, yew, ivy and holly and boughs of silver fir in honor of Artio, the deity who helps with births. The mistletoe was important because it contained the soul of the oak tree until spring. As an act of sympathetic magic to help ensure that the son of The Great Mother would be born strong and friendly, a great birch or apple needfire was lit. The Celts spent this night chanting and dancing their way into a frenzy waiting for the new born sun to show himself. A portion of the Yule log was saved to start the needfire of the following year. When the new sun was born, the feast followed and the Celts ate and drank cider (or golden ale) in excess, then gave presents as charms to ensure abundance during the following year. The sun god of the waxing half of the year was associated with the bull and the oak tree. The Coligny Calendar indicates that the Celts divided

the solar year into two halves, with the solstices as the hinges. The first half started at winter solstice in the month of Giamonios (December). In the solar zodiac this was the month of the goat and in the tree calendar the festival started at the end of the month of Ruis (elder), tree of death, and ended with B (birch), the tree of new beginnings. The apple tree was known as the tree of eternal life. The god Dianos (Bright Phase) was of paramount important, being the god of new beginnings. As a god with two heads looking in opposite directions he was associated with death and rebirth, doors, brightness and oak.
NAME Imbolic ALTERNATIVE Imbolic {Imbolg} (Swelling Belly) / Oimelc / Oimelg TYPE calendar event PURPOSE to nourish the newborn sun god DATE Equos (February) 3-4 / (8-day festival) SITE Tara DEITY Brighid / Tea SYMBOL right-facing swastika-shaped fire wheels RITES bonfire / mead / chanting / song / instrument REMARKS In Ireland the festival of Imbolic was in honor of the fire deity Brighid (the bride) who was the wetnurse to the sun god. This was the time when the cows began to lactate, the time of the Water Bearer in the zodiac calendar and the tree month Luis (Rowan) tree of substance food of the gods. A needfire of rowan wood was lit, and firewheels in the shape of right-facing swastikas were constructed from rush and set ablaze. The Imbolic festival also marked the beginning of spring season (Earrach). Sacrifices were offered, food and mead was in abundance and with the help of music and chants the Celts danced themselves into a frenzy, inviting the fire goddess to inhabit someone's body and walk among them. The Celts prayed that she would nourish the newborn sun deity and that he would grow strong and friendly. Tea, a Celtic fertility goddess, was the patron of the feast (Feis Tara) that was held in honor of Brighid. There was a prescribed order of presentation of the food served, with Bride cakes and dishes with rowan berries having special importance. After the feast followed games of skill, music and stories by bards, entertainment by poets, horse races, foot races, and meetings between families, clans and friends. Mead was the drink of all the calendar events dealing with the sun god and any breach of the divine peace was instantly punishable by death.

Furze fires were lit on hilltops in honor of fertility goddesses such as Onniona. During this event night and day were in balance, it was the beginning of the bright half of the year and the first day of the zodiac calendar with the end of Pisces and the beginning of Aries. The day was also in the month of Alder (hottest-burning) in the tree calendar. The Great Mother (Triple Goddess) visited her admirers first as the hag, dressed in black and representing physical death. It was a day of sacrifice, first by the druids, then by everyone. During the second day The Great Mother appeared as, a youth wearing white, signifying intellectual birth. On this day (spring equinox) everyone visited the mother cave (unicursal maze) representing the womb of the earth goddess and asked for the return of the male oak spirit from its winter abode in the female mistletoe. On the third day of the festival, the Triple Goddess appeared as a maiden in the prime of her life and dressed in scarlet: the color of the spirit, fire and sexual energy. The young goddess attended a day of feasting, drinking (mulberry wine), chariot races, games of skill and story-telling. All three days of the event were enhanced by dance, song, music and decoration by any new growth of leaves or flowers. The Great Mother was the perpetual virgin, mother of all Celtic deities, mankind and all living things. She was associated with the moon, fertility and continual motion.

SITE Uisnech, Ireland / Chartres, France DEITY Belenos / earth goddesses SYMBOL sun discs / 8-spoked sunwheels RITES bonfires / mead / beltane cakes / incense / chanting / music / dance REMARKS Beltainn {Beltuinn} marked the beginning of the summer season (Samhradh). Beltainn had two fires and was a 2-day event with 3 days of festival on either side. Bel (god) teine (fire) was a fertility festival in which Belenos the male sun god and the female earth goddess fertilized nature (life force) and encouraged healthy livestock, game and foliage. Belenos was associated with the bull and the oak tree. This was the month of the bull in the zodiac calendar and the month of Saille (Willow) in the tree calendar. Willow was also a tree of great importance to the moon goddess. Hawthorn crowns were made for the god and goddess. On the eve of Beltainn all fires were extinguished and all wheels ceased to turn. At the crack of dawn, the needfire was lit using two large very dry trunks of oak. The oak was rubbed together by 81 males working in shifts of 9 men each. The Beltainn fires were special fires called Coelcerth (Gaelic), now known as bonfires meaning "good fires". Two large circles were drawn on the ground and the sods were cut out and placed around the edges. The fuel for the fires was gathered by 9 teams of 9 men each who had to be free of metal. In the center of each circle they erected an oak log (phallus). Logs of the 8 remaining chieftain trees were then arranged like the spokes of the wheels of the sun god's chariot radiating around the two oak axles. A tent of the wood was constructed at the hub with the spokes radiating from it. The phallus was usually the tallest tree to be found in the area. It was limbed, barked and made smooth. Ropes were tied to the top and wound around the trunk. People in costumes of birds then held onto the ends of the ropes, jumped into the air and flew around the pole as the ropes unwound. Residues of this ritual are still visible in Maypole festivities. Circular Beltainn cakes (Tcharnicanare) made from eggs, milk and oatmeal were quartered and put into a container of calf skin. All the members of the tribe then filed by and retrieved a quarter of the wheel-cake. The person who picked the cake with the charcoal-blackened mark on it was called the cailleach bealtine (Beltain Carline) and became the sacrifice. The sacrifice was slain and cut into quarters with two sections placed on each hub. The hubs were then lit from the needfire and the festival was on. The members of the tribe circled the fires in a sunwise direction 3 times. Next, two young bulls were ritually killed. The cattle were driven 3 times between the fires of Beltainn with a rowan stick in order to purify them and to stimulate

fertility. The festival was associated with spring flowers and new boughs of leaves from the hawthorn which was sacred to the moon goddess. People wore bright colors to enhance the cycle and to help it on. This was a precarious time of year because winter stores were still the main source of food, as most new growth would not yet be ready to eat. Circular cheeses were rolled down the hills in a sunwise direction and the feast that followed was of mead, boar, game, sweet milk, milk curdled over the fire and, most importantly, fresh beef. During the feast, incense was burned and music was provided by the bards. The festival included ritual ecstatic dancing around the phallic stone, ceremonial acts of bowing and kissing, and leaping over the Beltaine fires. There were different types of races, entertainment by bards and poets, friends and family were together and a festive atmosphere prevailed. Beltainn Sunwheels (Maltese crosses) made of ash were set ablaze and thrown or rolled into the fires. That night the red and white dragons, representing the sun and the moon, performed sacred rites throughout the night. The druids beat skin drums and blew horns, and male and female warriors beat their swords against their shields until the dragons finally pass out from drinking too much mead. On the following morning the sun was greeted with "Good morning and show your eye". Special cups were carved into stone to catch dew, which was collected each morning of the festival before dawn and used for purification rituals. Ivy was also used for collecting dew. Women made ropes of cow-tail hair and dragged them through the grass to collect dew to beautify their faces, then hung them by their cows to ensure a greater quantity of milk. Branches of the rowan tree were also placed over doorways and barns. The Partholean, Nemedian, Danann and Goidel all landed in Ireland on Beltainn. The Celts of Ireland held their Great Assembly on Beltainn at Uisnech, the navel of Ireland. The Gauls also held their Great Assembly on Beltainn at Chartres which was in the territory of the Carnuti tribe. This was a time when disputes were settled and the druid's word was law.

This was the

day that the sun god, associated with the oak tree and the bull, was defeated by his son who was associated with the lynx and the holly tree. The solar event coincides with the departure of the Mighty Twins (Gemini) and the arrival of the ship (Cancer) in the zodiac calendar and is in the month of Duir (Oak) in the tree calendar. The two great battles of Magh Tuireadh in Ireland were fought on summer solstice between chieftains who represented the bull and Lynx gods. The oak god was made drunk on heather mead then led to the sacred site with 12 standing stones and an altar stone. The sun god was tied in the 5-fold position with willow thongs to an oak tree that had been trimmed into a T. As the sun set the sacrifice was then beaten until he passed out, then blinded, flayed, castrated and impaled with a mistletoe stake. He was then cut into joints on the altar stone where his blood was caught in a basin and used to sprinkle the people of the tribe so they would be vigorous and fertile. The flesh of the oak god was then roasted over twin oak fires that were either lit from a needfire or from a lightning strike, which was even more sacred. When the meat was cooked, the 12 males who were left out of the 13 chosen as initiates for the god chewed his flesh as they danced and chanted in a frenzy around the two fires in a figure of eight. The head and genitals of the sacrifice were saved and the head was cured with smoke or oil and used by the druids as an oracle as they did with the head of Bran. Death was considered a precursor to fertility, and the festival which followed honored female fertility deities such as Artio (Artemis), a moon goddess who was associated with bears, bees and the production of honey. The Manx wore a sprig of Mugwort (Artemisia Vulgaris) on their person during this day. The celebration which had begun with the sacred fires and sacrifices was followed by feasting, drinking, dancing and music. During this festival, the youth performed ritual displays to impress the opposite sex. This is the longest day of the year and the heat of sun grows in intensity. The Coligny Calendar shows that summer solstice was considered the beginning of the second half or waning half of the year and was in the month of Samonios (June).

RITES bonfire / mead / first sacrifices / sacred foods / ritual combat REMARKS In Ireland, Lughnasadh was a 3-day festival in honor of the sun god associated with the lynx and the holly club. The festival began with a torch procession to the highest site in the area such as Croagh Patrick, where the main bonfire in Ireland was held. The calendar event of Lughnasadh occurs while the sun is in the house of Leo (lynx) of the zodiac calendar. The month of Tinne (Holly), the bisexual tree, has just ended and Coll (hazel) perfection is just beginning in the tree calendar. The festival also marks the beginning of autumn (Foghmhar). A larger than usual needfire was lit and the night was passed in fasting and keeping a quiet vigil for the first rays of the sun god. As soon as the sun god appeared, "First Sacrifices" were made, to show appreciation for the blessings that the sun god and the earth goddesses had bestowed on the people. The festival of the highland cattle herders was an old festival called Bron Tro Gain and came to Ireland with the Nemedians or the Firbolg. Bulls were sacrificed and this was the time when the cattle were taken to their winter pastures where they were fattened for winter slaughter. Some cattle were slaughtered in August so that their meat could be dried and the skins cured in the hot sun. At Emain Macha in Ulster, Lughnasadh also served as a wake for the goddess Tailtiu. A re-enactment of the events that led to her death was held and the races and other games were her funeral games. At Wexford in the province of Leinster, the festival was associated with the goddess Carman. Lughnasadh was also a commemoration of Lugh himself as a harvest festival as well as a cattle and horse fair, with chariot races, mock swordplay, women's races, entertainment by musicians and poets, and meetings between friends, family and clans. The feast itself began by eating curd cheese circles and butter made from the cows' milk of that morning. Special bread was also made from grain that was cut, dried, winnowed, ground and baked on a rowan fire that day. During the festival of Lughnasadh, deeds of violence, levying debts, abductions and the divorcing of a husband or a wife were all prohibited on penalty of death. Trial marriages of 11 days were consummated on this day.

RITES bonfire / triangle cakes REMARKS The autumn equinox is another day of balance between dark and bright, when the nights and days were of equal length. Bonfires were lit on the morning to lend strength to the sun god who is losing to the powers of darkness. In the zodiac calendar this was the end of the virgin earth goddess (Virgo) and the beginning of the house of balance (Libra). It is the month of Muir (Blackberry) in the tree calendar a plant of resurrection. Furrowed triangle cakes were eaten in honor of the mother goddess who would guide the spirit of the oak tree to the mistletoe where it would abide for the winter. This was the beginning of the dark half of the year, a time when preparations for winter began.

It was the time of the long winter nights when the deities of the underworld had the responsibility of maintaining order. The eve of Samhain began by breaking the day's fast with a feast of goose, chitterlings (boar intestines) and bread baked from acorn. All fires were extinguished and no wheels were allowed to turn until the next eve. During Samhain the door between this world and The Otherworld opened upon each other, permitting spirits from either side to roam freely. The hearth was prepared for relatives who had passed on as a show of respect for the dead and to keep them happy. During Samhain night, it was possible for those brave enough to raid The Otherworld for treasures, but the time between first cockcrow and daybreak was better spent asleep in the safety of one's home. Most warriors spent the night in their forts eating, drinking and boasting of their past brave deeds in an attempt to keep the souls of dead warriors at bay. The following eve the great needfire was lit on the Hill of Ward in Ireland in honor of Tlachtga, a goddess of knowledge. The needfire was lit by a druid on a specially prepared site. A circular trench was dug using the cut-out turf to make an inner shelf. The wood was rowan and was

donated by the chieftains of Ireland. The Samhain fire was lit by using a specially-built wheel with 8 spokes and an axle of sacred wood. The axle was placed on the starter wood and a long rope was wound once around the axle and pulled so that the wheel spun in a sunwise direction. The friction from the wooden axle against the starter wood created enough heat to start the Samhain fire (Tlachtgha). The head chieftains of Ireland then brought fire from the sacred needfire at Tlachtga to their provinces and all the hearth fires were relit with a torch from the chieftain fires. The Rites of Protection were performed to any corners in the home, thresholds, chimneys, windows and any other openings. When the druids lit the needfire at Tlachtga which was 12 miles from Tara, a white bull was sacrificed, marking the end of the grazing season. Selected people swung burning brooms and fire-balls around their heads during special sun dances. Filidhs divined using hazelnuts and apples in association with fire and water. The feast was held at Tara afterwards. The night was spent feasting with games, entertainment, and sword dances performed by 8 warriors. As at all calendar events, both instrumental and vocal music was important. Poets and bards remembered the brave deeds of the warriors now living in The Otherworld and sung their praises and beat their drums. Mead was the drink of most calendar festivals, and any breach of the Divine Peace was instantly punishable by death. Through the art of dancing, singing and use of intoxicants, the Celts could achieve ecstatic states which would allow the gods to walk among their admirers. After the festival, cattle were slaughtered and salted away for winter which was very rough in some Celtic areas. This was also the time for wars and combats. The dark half of the year was the time of the warriors and each made sure his or her weapons were ready. The druids prepared their Aspen rods which they used to measure corpses. The festival was in the month of Scorpio (serpent) of the solar zodiac or the old month of Ophiuchus (serpent holder). It was also the month of Peith (Guelder Rose) or Ngetal (reed) of the tree calendar.

TOTEMS
NAME Bear EPITHET The Brown Animal SYMBOL OF power / resurrection STAR GROUP Aries (bear) / Ursa Major (big bear) / Ursa Minor (little bear) / Arcturus (bear) ASSOCIATED honey / mead SEE ALSO Art / Arthur / Artio / Math REMARKS The bear was a mean adversary against a hunter armed only with a spear or bow, but its fur had many uses and its meat contained a great amount of fat to mix with fruit and berries and acorn meal to help ward off vitamin deficiencies in winter. The bear was a great fan of honey, from which the Celts made their sacred drink of mead. Bears also have a taste for salmon, another sacred food. The moon goddess Artio was associated with the bear and numerous Celtic characters were named after the animal including Art, Arthur and Math. Because the bear hibernates in winter it has a supernatural element dealing with resurrection. Many stone sculptures of the animal have been found in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The constellation Aries was known to the Celts as the bear, and today there are the constellations Ursa Major (big bear) and Ursa Minor (little bear). The old North Star was called Arcturus which also means bear.
NAME Bee EPITHET The builder ALTERNATIVE Beach (Irish) / Gwenynen (Welsh) SYMBOL OF resurrection / reincarnation / fertility ASSOCIATED mead SEE ALSO Artio / Creide / Uroica REMARKS The honey bee is a stinging insect with 4 wings and 6 legs. Their society is divided into 3 casts; the queen (fertile female), drones (fertile males) and the workers (sterile females). Because they have a highly developed parental instinct, they store masses of honey for their undeveloped offspring in larval state who then reincarnated into a bee. An important event in the life of the bee colony is the nuptial flight of the queen followed by the drones. She flys straight up where she mates with the strongest drone,

the weaker are then eliminated by the workers. This social style was imitated by the Amazons, and Celtic women also chose the best males to mate with. Another important event of the bee is the swarm. This happens when the hive becomes too crowded. A queen followed by up to 30,000 bees will leave the old hive behind and fly in a swarm until they find a new place to settle. The Celts used the swarm idea when their territory became overcrowded. Fermented honey, beeswax or honeycomb and water made mead, the oldest form of fermented liquor. Because the bees hibernated in winter they were a symbol of resurrection. They were also beneficial in the fertilization of flowers. The goddesses Artio and Uroica and the druid Creide were all associated with bees. Beeswax was also important in the making of candles and essential in the casting method called the lost wax process which was used in making bronze weapons and tools or ornaments of bronze, silver or gold.
NAME Boar EPITHET The Wild, Savage Beast ALTERNATIVE Torc (Irish) / sow (fully grown female) SYMBOL OF war / ferocity / fertility ASSOCIATED moon goddess / warriors SEE ALSO Aine na gClair / Amhairghin / Arduinna / Baco / Cerridwen / Danu / Mac Cecht / Manannan / Moccos / Pryderi REMARKS The wild boar is a fast powerfully-built animal with razor-sharp tusks and an ability to eat almost anything. They are easily aggravated and are known for their fierce fast zig-zag attacks. They are one of the cloven-hoofed animals with a short-legged heavy body covered with a tough bristly hide and a long mobile snout. The wild boar lived in a unit called a sounder which is like an extended family or clan. The boar was revered by the Celts, and was considered the royal beast of the Danann. They provided a sacred food, and Manannan had magical boars that could be eaten one day and were ready to eat again the next. Hunting the boar was a sacred act accomplished with a spear. In Bronze Age Ireland, the sacrifice of the boar was a sovereign right of Danu. Boar hides were also used for armor and shields. Boars were associated with the Otherworld and fed on the sacred acorn of the oak tree, as well as on beech nuts. Because their fur came in the colors red, white and black they were also associated with the moon goddess. The boars were prolific breeders and a symbol of fertility. The deities Arduinna, Moccos and Baco were all associated with boars in Gaul. In a Welsh tale, Pryderi chased a white boar with red ears into a fortress that disappeared. He was also killed over magical pigs which were given to his

father. As a magical animal, the boar was known for its healing powers. Under Brehon law, the domesticated sow had three equal divisions: one part for her body, one part for her anticipated value and one part for her litter. Warriors were associated with these animals and the words Torc and Triath both mean "chieftain" (hero) and "boar". A boar fire also meant a chieftain fire, and Mac Cecht lit one on a Samhain. Druids were sometimes called swine. Many Celtic stories make reference to warriors being turned into boars, and one on Ben Bulben was described as being a gray-cropped white boar with no tail or ears. Twrch Trwyth was a ferocious boar and leader of a sounder that caused destruction throughout Ireland. When the Goidel conquered Ireland, Amhairghin recited a poem which contained a line stating that he was the wild boar of valor. Attesting to their popularity are the great number of artifacts depicting the boar found throughout the Celtic world. They appear as decorations on coins, swords, shields, helmets, and as sculptures in stone, wood and bronze. There are three Irish words for pig: muc, orc and torc. Northwestern Spain and northern Portugal have numerous full-size stone sculptures, and Pictish pictographs in Scotland often have the image of the boar.
NAME Bull EPITHET To Swell ALTERNATIVE Tarbh (Irish) / Tarw (Welsh) SYMBOL OF virility / ferocity / waxing STAR GROUP Taurus (bull) ASSOCIATED sun god SEE ALSO Belenos / Esus REMARKS The Celtic zodiac at one time began in Taurus which initiated the waxing half of the year. Belenos was the sun god of that part of the year. The war god Esus was also associated with the bull. Druids sacrificed white bulls to the sun god and performed the bull feast as an important divining tool. The vicious war of the Cualnge Cattle Raid was over a majestic bull and the war ended with a battle between two supernatural bulls. The ox, on the other hand, was a castrated bull and was a docile animal of great strength (dumb ox) used to haul wagons, skids of logs or rocks. The steer was a young castrated male and was raised as a beef animal. The bull was a symbol of male fertility and strength and was a familiar motif in the art of the Celts. Stone sculptures have been found in northwestern Spain and northern Portugal, and their images have been found on cauldrons, coins, sword scabbards, and Pictish stone pictographs. Stone votive offerings depicting bulls were reclaimed from the harbor of Burghead in Scotland.

NAME Cat EPITHET The Stalker ALTERNATIVE Catt (Gaelic) / Tom (M) SYMBOL OF stealth / waning powers / hunter STAR GROUP Leo (lion) / Lynx ASSOCIATED moon goddess / sun god SEE ALSO Lugh / Cat REMARKS The cat is probably best known for its ability to climb and leap great heights and for its incredible sense of balance. All cats except the cheetah have the ability to retract their claws completely. They also have very keen night vision and the female is an especially notable solitary hunter. A blind cat had special supernatural association. The cat in Celtic mythology was often associated with the Otherworld and was an animal sacred to the moon goddess. Red, white and black cats were of special interest. The ancient Silures tribe of Wales venerated the the wildcat and in a cave at Clough in Connacht there was a chair of silver with a slender black cat relaxing on it. The Pictish founder of Caithness in Scotland was named Cat, and the Clanna Stewart of Scotland had the cat as its totem. The cat totem ruled the waning half of the Celtic year. The lynx, which was a common cat in Europe during the time of the Celts, had a heavy body, tufted ears, heavy side whiskers and green-gold eyes. They were night hunters and preferred to spend their days resting in a cool cave or other lair. The totem of the Danann hero Lugh was a lynx. In Celtic mythology there was an island called Lyonesse off the coast of Cornwall which sank beneath the sea. Lynx is also the name of a constellation between the Great Bear and Cancer.
NAME Cow ALTERNATIVE Bo (Gaelic) / Buwch (Welsh) SYMBOL OF fertility / wealth ASSOCIATED earth goddess SEE ALSO Boann / Bress / Brighid / Caibre / Cian / Cu Chulainn / Damona / Ethne / Morrighan / REMARKS All domestic cattle were originally bred from the Ur-cow (Aurochs). They were huge reddish-colored animals that roamed the forest of Europe in the wild state. The last one died in a Polish zoo in AD 1627. Cattle were important animals in the mythology of the Celtic people; the cow was a symbol of the earth goddess and the bull was associated with the sun god. Cattle with white hair and red ears were a definite sign of the Otherworld. Gray was also an Otherworld color for cows and both Cian and the Fianna had supernatural cows whose names referred to gray.



Chapter 26 – TOTEMS
1063
The fire goddess Brighid was weaned on the milk of a white cow with red ears, Boann was referred to as Boann of the White Cows and the handmaiden Ethne survived entirely on milk from a magic cow. The Morrighan appeared to Cu Chulainn as a red cow with 3 teats. When Cairbre Caithcheann (Cathead), a person of a service clan, took the position as high chieftain of Ireland by force, the goddess of Ireland showed her displeasure by making the udders of all the cows in Ireland go dry. Cattle were used as an exchange value, cows' milk was the favorite non-alcholic drink of the Celts and cheese was a major food staple. Cow hides were used to cover their coracle and for the making of clothing. The bride price for a noble maiden was 21 cows. The noble cow was displayed on Pictish stones in Scotland. The Danann Bress tried to trade the secret of cows with continuous milk for his freedom. Celtic society was inseparable from cattle herding.
NAME Crane EPITHET The Talkative / The Chattering SYMBOL OF curative powers / patience / augury / shapechanging STAR GROUP Grus (crane) ASSOCIATED moon goddess / willow trees / water / maze dance SEE ALSO Esus / Manannan / Midhir REMARKS The crane is a primitive but beautiful bird which stands on long stilted legs. It has a powerful neck, large wings and a long bill. Although it is not a water bird, it spends much of its life with its feet in the water catching fish. The Numidian and Balearic Cranes have black and white feathers with red skin showing through: colors sacred to the moon goddess. Cranes arranged their catch in a format that resembles the spokes of a wheel. They place the tails of the fish on top of each other with the heads pointing out in a fan. When they fly back to the nest they clamp the tails in their beaks and the weight of the fish is evenly distributed. Wheels were symbols of the cyclic movement of the sun, moon and zodiac. The constellation Grus was named for the crane. The Celts sacrificed wild cranes to the moon goddess. The god Esus was associated with cranes, and Manannan and the Fianna both carried their treasure in a crane bag. Mythology also mentions a number of stories where women were changed into cranes. The Celts performed a sacred dance called the Crane Dance (Spiral Castle). The dance (9 steps then a leap) was performed in a unilateral spiral maze through which the dead were carried on their way to the Otherworld. The maze dance was called Troy Town in England, Caer-Droia in Wales and New Grange in Ireland was referred to as the Spiral

category or someone who has had special training such as a champion warrior. The red dragon was the guardian of the intellect (sun cycle) and the white dragon was the guardian of the emotions (moon cycle). Because they danced to different beats they would have a yearly conflict, but only settled their differences every 19 years. When the Britons conquered England, Prydain put an end to the Dragon Tyranny (state of continuous warfare). Lludd had a problem with two dragons that fought every year, then changed into wild boars as they tired. The filidh Fedelm prophesied for Medbh that her troops would be colored crimson and held at bay by a dragon in his youth. Uther's epithet Pendragon meant "dragon head", a reference to the spring equinox. The dragon's tail is a reference to the autumn equinox. Dragon head and tail are terms used to denote the ascending and descending nodes of the moon and planets. Fingin the druid was described as having the sharp sight of the dragon. The fertility goddess Creddylad was fought over by two dragons every year. The filidh Caer lived on the lake of the dragon while she was in the form of a swan for half the year.

Another small ritual wagon carrying a funeral urn has 2 ducks at each end, with the pairs pointing in opposite directions. A cauldron has tiny sculptures of ducks affixed to the rim, suggesting reincarnation, and a belt was found with ducks and sun symbols alternating. Most Celtic associations with ducks seem to imply a connection with death and the Otherworld.

REMARKS Eagles are the largest members of the hawk family. They have strong hooked beaks with sharp cutting edges. They are birds of prey and totally carnivorous, eating animals from hares to young fawns, as well as fish. They tend to make their nests in remote and inaccessible places. Celtic images of eagles have shown up on the crests of helmets, on coins and as tiny figures on a cauldron flesh hook. One cauldron has mounts in the shape of bulls with eagles perched on their head. In Scotland, the Picts used the eagle on many of their pictographs. The mythology of the Celts has associated the eagle with shapechanging and the zodiac. In the Welsh story of Culhwch, Gwrhyr the interpreter questions the eagle as to the whereabouts of Mabon. In an Irish story, Llew changes into an eagle in an attempt to escape his predicament.

The bird has a long snakelike neck, hisses when irritated and will give a vicious bite when threatened. The wild birds breed in the north. Geese were domesticated very early and their feather and down were collected for their warmth. Because of its territorial nature and aggressive behavior, the gander makes an excellent guard. In Celtic mythology, the birds are sacred to the moon goddess and are also associated with the sun gods such as Ocelos. A votive offering from Roquepertuse shows geese pulling a sun chariot. A sculpture of a goose sat on the central column of the entrance of the sanctuary at Roquepertuse and another sat between the heads of the god Dianos on the sculpture from the same site. The goose was also thought to guard against disease, and although it was normally taboo to eat, it was a special food at Samhain. As Cu Chulainn offered to serve goose to his friend Lugaid, it must have been at the time of Samhain. Pictographs of the goose are found in the Scottish Highlands on the Pictish stones.

Etain, Rhiannon, Medbh and Macha all represented the mare goddess, and Epona was the Divine Mare, protector of the species. In Ireland, the high chieftain was ritually mated with a horse and the success of the tribe depended on the success of that relationship. Many men had epithets such as Eochaidh, meaning stud, having mated with the mares (women) who had the epithet of sovereignty. Ferghus mac Roig had such a large penis that he was called The Great Horse. A horse or horses also hauled the chariot of the sun god across the sky. The sun god Atepomaros had horses sacrificed to him and the war god Rudiobos had a sculpture of a man-horse dedicated to him. The sun god Lugh claimed to be the first person to use a horse in Ireland but at the same time the filidh Figol told Lugh he would bind the urine of the Fomorii warriors and their horses with his magic.

Horses were high on the lists of gifts that noble gave each other, and were often decorated in gold, bronze and precious stones. Horse remains have been found in chariot burials and their images were engraved on vessels, coins and the earth itself, such as at Uffington. Many warriors were born at the same time as their horses and they became bonded with them. The great female horse warriors, the Amazons, sacrificed horses to a deity. The Picts left pictographs of horses in Scotland and the ancients named star groups Pegasus (winged horse) and Equuleus (colt).

Ravens pair for life and tend to use the same nest every year, building it in remote rocky regions. The mating rituals of the raven involve dramatic aerial displays with power dives that cause their feathers to beat like drums. The ravens are the largest of the songbirds and will mimic numerous animal sounds, including human speech. They are very talkative birds and carry on conversations with each other even when they are long distances apart. It is these qualities that have earned the bird the epithet of Messenger of the Gods. As scavengers, the ravens were associated with battle scenes and became linked to the goddesses of war such as Macha, Morrighan and Badbh Catha, associating them with the Raven's Croak (to foresee evil). Lugh and Bran were two war leaders who had ravens in attendance. The bird was
