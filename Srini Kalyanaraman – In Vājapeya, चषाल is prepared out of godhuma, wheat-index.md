In Vājapeya, चषाल is prepared out of godhuma, wheat
chaff to accomplish bhasman, 'calcined metal'
This monograph posits three distinct markers of historical analysis of metallurgical repertoire of Tin-Bronze Revolution in Ancient India, from 5th millennium BCE.: 1.Evolution of Ujjain symbol on ancient coins is from Indus Script tradition
Siddham symbol. On Samudragupta, Gold Dinar, 7.70g, Ashvamedha typeRead as sidhato.'accomplished'.
2.sidhato mardana (Text of inscription on Ujjain coin, ca.2nd cent. BCE) signiies accomplishment of calcination of metal -- in the Ujjain mint. A synonym for mardana is māraka signified by the 'peacock' hieroglyph.maraka 'peacock' Rebus: (cf. लोहमारक) 'calcining' on Samarra bowl ca. 4000 BCE (i.e. 5th millennium BCE). 3.Yupa found in 4MSR Binjor archaeological site (dated ca. 2500 BCE) establishes the Veda continuum of calcination of metal and continues in 19 Yupa inscriptions of historical periods. See: Pine-cone (Vatican) and peacocks (Samarra bowl, Harappa) as hieroglyphs http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2013/11/pine-cone-vatican-and-peacockssamarra.html
The Samarra bowl (ca. 4000 BC) an exhibit at the Pergamonmuseum, Berlin.
The bowl was excavated as Samarra by Ernst Herzfeld in the 1911-1914 campaign, and described in a 1930 publication. The design consists of a rim, a circle of eight fish, and four fish swimming towards the center being caught by four birds. As is typical of cultures from this region, the use of a base six numerical system can be seen in the lines surrounding the bowl, so that there are a total of 120 lines, or four quarters with 30 lines each. At the center is a swastika symbol.
The bowl was broken, part of the rim is missing, and one crack ran right across the central symbol, so that the swastika symbol should be considered a reconstruction.

वृत्त -- transformation or pulverized calcination , change into (ऋगष-वेि-प्रादिशाख्य ). This term is signified by the vaṭṭa 'circle' on Ujjain symbol. There are four circles joined to a + symbol. The + signifies fire-altar kaNDa. The four circles signify four mineral ores. These are transformed into or calcined as bhasman, gaining the essence of the metal or alloy metal in a smelting operation in the fire-altar. Rebus: वृत्त a matter , affair , business.

Until now the legend on this coin type had been read as 'rathimadana'. This is the first specimen to show at least the first three letters of the legend clear beyond doubt. Credit goes to Harry Falk to have read the legend as 'sidhato'. The second part of the name appears to have been correctly identified from the available specimens except for the last letter which still is somewhat doubtful but '...madana' is well possible. In that case the complete name would be 'Sidhathomadana'. [unquote]

I suggest that the text on the coin should read sidhato ma(r)dana 'accomplished crushing, grinding, rubbing, anointing alloy metals). This is an extraordinary accomplishment in metallurgy: to achieve powdered metal referred to as bhasmam, 'metallic ash'.

Veda archaeology in 19 yupa inscriptions and Binjor aṣṭāśri octoganal pillar, associated Indus Script seal https://tinyurl.com/y7mu3rdl This is a tribute to the brilliant ongoing work of documenting Veda textual tradition. See links in: https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋेग्विः _सूिं_१.१ The very first ̥rca reads:
ॐ अ॒दिमीी॑ळे पु॒रोदही॑िं य॒॓ज्ञस्य िे॒वमृक्त॒ त्व िी॑मष । होिाी॑रं र॒त्नर्ािी॑ममष ॥१॥
I submit that there is abundant archaeological attestation of Veda tradition in many archaeological sites of Greater India. One site of Binjor (near Anupgarh) has yielded stunning evidence of a Yupa and an associated inscription on an Indus Script Seal which documents a metalwork catalogue.
The earliest evidence of Veda archaeology (ca. 2500 BCE) comes from Binjor (near Anupgarh) -where an aṣṭāśri octoganal pillar was found in situ, on the banks of River Sarasvati.

Shapes of Yupa: A. Commemorative stone yupa, Isapur – from Vogel, 1910-11, plate 23; drawing based on Vedic texts – from Madeleine Biardeau, 1988, 108, fig. 1; cf. 1989, fig. 2); C. Miniature wooden yupa and caSAla from Vaidika Samsodana Mandala Museum of Vedic sacrificial utensils – from Dharmadhikari 1989, 70) (After Fig. 5 in Alf Hiltebeitel, 1988, The Cult of Draupadi, Vol. 2, Univ. of Chicago Press, p.22).
Almost all yupa inscriptions, all are aṣṭāśri octoganal pillars (19 including 5 of Mulavarman in Borneo) refer to performance of a Soma Samsthā yajña. One Mulavarman inscription cites
from Rāmāyaṇa the expression bahusuvarṇaka..,.There is also archaeological evidence of śyena citi from Purola, Uttarakhand. Most emphatic veda continuum.
See: Binjor Indus Script Seal & Mulavarman yupa inscription, relate to yajna for बहुसुवणाक , bahusuvarṇaka, 'to possess many gold
pieces' Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/z2q2rk6 http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2015/12/binjorindus-script-seal-mulavarman.html बहुसुवणाक , bahusuvarṇaka, is a metaphor for the creation of wealth using fire, fire-altars as furnaces/smelters and yupa as invocations to Cosmic pillar to the Cosmic Dancer, the Paramatman to transmute mere earth and stones into metal, a form of wealth. The entire Vedic corpus is in nuce (nutshell) in the processing of Soma, which is NOT a herbal but a mineral. A synonym for Soma is ams'u with the cognate ancu 'iron' (Tocharian).
The key expressions on the Mulavarman Yupa inscription (D.175) are in Samskritam and one fragment reads: yaṣṭvā bahusuvarṇakam; tasya yajñasya yūpo ‘yam. This means "from yaṣṭi to possess many gold pieces; this Yupa is a commemoration of that yajna." The interpretation is comparable to the Indus Script seal found in Binjor in the context of a fire-altar with an
octagonal brick, yaṣṭi. The seal can be seen as an inscription detailing metalwork catalogue of



8
the bahusuvarṇnakam 'to possess many gold pieces' that was produced by the smelter/furnace operations using the fire-altar.
Prof. Kern identified the expression with bahuhiraNya, a particular Soma yajna. Balakanda of Ramayana has this citation: nityam pramuditAh sarve yatha kRitayuge tathA as'vamedha s'atair ishTvA tathA bahusuvarNakaih (Balakanda I,95) The referene is to the as'vamedha sattra desirous of possessing many pieces of gold. In reference to Meghanada's yajna, the reference reads:
agniSTomo 's'vamedha ca yajno bahusuvarNakah rAjasUyas tathA yajno gomedho vaishNavas tathA mahes'vare
(UttrakANDa, XXV, 87-9) A rajasuya yajna with prayers to mahesvara is also linked to many pieces of gold.
Another translation: "Thereupon that foremost of twice born ones Usanas of austere penances, wishing the prosperity of the sacrifice, said to Ravana the Rakshasa chief "Hear,I shall relate to thee everything, O king ;thy son hath met with the fruits of many a sacrifice Agnistoma, Asvamedha, Bahusuvarnaka." (vrm 7.30)
(B.Ch. Chhabra, Yupa Inscriptions, in: Jean Ph. Vogel, 1947,India antiqua, Brill Archive, p.82).
Generosity associated with the performance of yajna is referenced in a yupa inscription. “Let the foremost amongst the priests and whatsoever pious men (there be) hear of the generous deed of Mulavarman, let them hear of his great gift, his gift of cattle, his gift of a kalpavRkSam, his gift of land'.”
Thus, Yupa inscriptions of Mulavarma are delineation of an economic institution. Vogel also notes: “Both the scholarship and the workmanship of our yupa inscriptions bear testimony of a
considerable degree of Hindu culture in Eastern Borneo during the period to which they belong.” Mulavarman's grandfather KuNDungga had the cooperation of Hindu priests 'who had come here from different parts' (Vogel, 1918, pp. 167-232).
The names of yajnas are clearly related to the 'fruits of the yajna' which is to yield बहुसुवणाक , bahusuvarṇaka, 'many pieces of gold'. That this is recognized as a Soma yajna reaffirms Soma not as a herbal but a mineral smelted, furnaced through fire-altars, yajñakuṇḍa.
See: New light on Vedic Sarasvati River as navigable waterway, Binjor discoveries of Indus Script hypertexts https://tinyurl.com/y87y2hdv
An octagonal yupa has been found at the site Binjor 4MSR on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati, near Anupgarh, Rajasthan.

The OSL investigations demonstrate that the palaeo-channels seen on this satellite (LANDSAT) image which shows a wide (approx 6 km. wide) channel constituted a navigable waterway during periods between 13th and 3rd millennium BCE.
These two findings complement the earlier stunning discovery of a yajña kuṇḍda with an
octagonal brick pillar. Such an octagonal pillar is referred to as aṣṭāśri yupa in ancient Vedic texts. Binjor Yupa of Sarasvati Vaidika civilization is yajñasya ketu (RV 3.8.8), a proclamation emblem of performance of a Soma Samsthā yajña. Such a yajña yields bahusuvarṇakam; 'many gold pieces' and thus, a wealth-producing metallurgical enterprise performed with śraddhā, 'dedication, devotion' and prayers.
caṣāla is a unique metallurgical technique documented in the Veda texts to infuse carbon into metal in furnaces to harden the metal or to produced hardened alloys. caṣāla is godhūma, fumes of wheat chaff which infuse angāra, 'carbon'. The expression caṣāla 'wheat chaff fume' is signified by the sacred hieroglyph of caṣāla 'snout of varāha.'
The yupa is a conclusive evidence of Veda culture in the Binjor (4MSR) site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. This is specially described in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa & Rigveda.
An exposition by Sadhashiv A Dange: “the yūpa is described as being the emblem of the
sacrifice (RV III.8.8 yajñasya ketu). Though it is fixed on the terrestrial plane at the sacrifice, it



10
is expected to reach the path of the gods. Thus, about the many sacrificial poles (fixed in the Paśubandha, or at the Horse-sacrifice) it is said that they actually provide the path for reaching the gods (ib., 9 devānām api yanti pāthah). They are invoked to carry the oferings to the gods (ib., 7 te no vyantu vāryam devatrā), which is the prerogative of the fire-god who is acclaiemd as ‘messenger’ (dūta); cf. RV I.12.1 agrim dūtam vṛṇimahe). In what way is the yūpa expected to carry the chosen offering to the gods? It is when the victim is tied to the sacrificial pole. The
prallelism between the sacrificial fire and the yūpa is clear. The fire carries it through the smoke and flames; the yūpa is believed to carry it before that, when the victim is tied to it, as its upper end is believed to touch heaven. A more vivid picture obtains at the yajapeya. Here the yūpa is eight-angled, corresponding to the eight qurters. (śat. Br. V.2.1.5 aṣṭāśrir yūpo bhavati; the
reason given is that the metre Gayatri has eight letters in one foot; not applicable here, as it is just hackneyed. At Taitt.Sam. I.7.9.1, in this context a four-angled yūpa is prescribed.) The one yūpa is conceived as touching three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether subterranean. The portion that is above the caṣāla (ring) made of wheat-dough (cf.śat. Br. V.2.1.6 gaudhūmam caṣālam
bhavati) represents Heaven. This is clear from the rite of ascending to the caṣāla, made of wheatdough, in the Vajapeya sacrifice. The sarificer ascends to it with the help of a ladder (niśrayaṇī); and, while doing so, calls upon his wife, ‘Wife, come; let us ascend to Heaven’. As soon as he ascends and touches the caṣāla, he utters, ‘We have reached Heavven, O gods’ (ib., 12). According to Sāyaṇa on the Taiit.Sam. I.7.9.1, the sacrificer stretches his hands upwards when he reaches the caṣāla and says, ‘We have reached the gods that stay in heaven’ (udgṛhītābhyām bāhubhyām). Even out of the context of the Vajapeya, when the yūpa is erected (say in the Paśubandha), it is addressed, ‘For the earth you, for the mid-region you, for heaven you (do we hoist you)’ (Taitt. Sam. I.3.6.1-3; cf. śat. Br. III.7.1.5-6). The chiselled portion of the yūpa is above the earth. So, from the earth to heaven, through the mid-region the yūpa represents the
three-regions. The un-chiselled portion of the yūpa is fixed in the pit (avaṭa) and the avaṭa, which represents the subterranean regions, is the region of the ancestors (ib.4).The yūpa, thus, is the axis mundi...Then, it gave rise to various myths, one of them being that of the stūpa of Varuṇa, developing further into Aśvattha tree, which is nothing but a symbol of a tree standing with roots in the sun conceived as the horse (aśva-stha = aśvattha), a symbol obtaining at varius places in the Hindu tradition. It further developed into the myth of the churning staff of the mountain (Amṛta-manthana); and yet further, into the myth of Vasu Uparicara, whom Indra is said to have given his yaṣṭi (Mb.Adi. 6y3.12-19). This myth of the yaṣṭi was perpetuated in the ritual of the Indra-dhvaja in the secular practice (Brhatsamhita, Chapter XLII), while in the s’rauta practice the original concept of the axis mundi was transformed into the yūpa that reached all regions, including the under-earth. There is another important angle to the yūpa. As the axis mundi it
stands erect to the east of the Uttaravedi and indicates the upward move to heaven. This position is unique. If one takes into account the position of the Gārhapatya and the āhavaniya fireplaces, it gets clear that the march is from the earth to heaven; because, the Gārhapatya is associated with this earth and it is the household fire (cf. gṛhā vai gārhapatyah, a very common saying in the ritual texts), and the seat of the sacrificer’s wife is just near it, along with the wives of the gods, conceptually. From this fire a portion is led to the east, in the quarter of the rising sun (which is in tune with such expressions as prāñcam yajñam pra nayatā sahāyah, RV X.101.2); where the Ahavaniya fireplace is structured. As the offerings for the gods are cast in the Ahavaniya, this fire is the very gate of heaven. And, here stands, the yūpa to its east taking a rise heavenwards. This is, by far, the upward rise. But, on the horizontal plane, the yūpa is posted half-inside, halfoutside the altar. The reason is, that thereby it controls the sacred region and also the secular, i.e.



11
both heaven and earth, a belief attested by the ritual texts. (Tait. Sam. VI.6.4.1; Mait. Sam. III.9.4).”(Dange, SA, 2002, Gleanings from Vedic to Puranic age, New Delhi, Aryan Books International, pp. 20-24).
The Sukta RV X.101 reads, explaining the entire yajña as a metaphor of golden-tinted soma poured into a wooden bowl, a smelting process yielding weapons of war and transport and implements of daily life (Translation of RV X.101):
10.101.01 Awake, friends, being all agreed; many in number, abiding in one dwelling, kindle Agni. I invoke you, Dadhikra, Agni, and the divine Us.as, who are associated with Indra, for our protection. [In one dwelling: lit., in one nest; in one hall]. 10.101.02 Construct exhilarating (hymns), spread forth praises, construct the ship which is propelled by oars, prepare your weapons, make ready, lead forth, O friends, the herald, the adorable (Agni). 10.101.03 Harness the ploughs, fit on the yokes, now that the womb of earth is ready, sow the seed therein, and through our praise may there be abundant food; may (the grain) fall ripe towards the sickle. [Through our praise: sow the seed with praise, with a prayer of the Veda; s’rus.t.i = rice and other different kinds of food].
10.101.04 The wise (priests) harness the ploughs, they lay the yokes apart, firmly devoted through the desire of happiness. [Happiness: sumnaya_ = to give pleasure to the gods]. 10.101.05 Set up the cattle-troughs, bind the straps to it; let us pour out (the water of) the well, which is full of water, fit to be poured out, and not easily exhausted. 10.101.06 I pour out (the water of) the well, whose cattle troughs are prepared, well fitted with straps, fit to be poured out, full of water, inexhaustible. 10.101.07 Satisfy the horses, accomplish the good work (of ploughing), equip a car laden with good fortune, pour out (the water of) the well, having wooden cattle-troughs having a stone rim, having a receptable like armour, fit for the drinking of men. 10.101.08 Construct the cow-stall, for that is the drinking place of your leaders (the gods), fabricate armour, manifold and ample; make cities of metal and impregnable; let not the ladle leak, make it strong. 10.101.09 I attract, O gods, for my protection, your adorable, divine mine, which is deserving of sacrifice and worship here; may it milk forth for us, like a large cow with milk, giving a thousand strreams, (having eaten) fodder and returned. 10.101.10 Pour out the golden-tinted Soma into the bowl of the wooden cup, fabricate it with the stone axes, gird it with ten bands, harness the beast of burden to the two poles (of the cart). 10.101.11 The beast of burden pressed with the two cart-poles, moves as if on the womb of sacrifice having two wives. Place the chariot in the wood, without digging store up the Soma. 10.101.12 Indra, you leaders, is the giver of happiness; excite the giver of happiness, stimulate him, sport with him for the acquisition of food, bring down here, O priests, Indra, the son of Nis.t.igri_, to drink the Soma. [Nis.t.igri_ = a name of Aditi: nis.t.im ditim svasapatni_m girati_ti nis.t.igri_raditih].
Thus, what has been discovered in Binjor is in Rigveda tradition of a yupa topped by caṣāla
(godhuma, wheat chaff smoke) to carburize metal in furnace, fire-altar. The yupa is RV III.8.8
yajñasya ketu, the signature tune of the prayer, the signifier. Hieroglyph for caṣāla is the snout of varāha, the Veda Purusha. caṣāla and yupa are the vajra, which yield the adamantine glue, sanghgāta which is signified by the hieroglyphs: sangaDa, 'chain, lathe-portable furnace' in Indus Script tradition of data archiving.

A s'ivalinga is meḍhā -- with a unique octagonal/quadrangular shape as prescribed in Vedic texts -- rebus medha 'yajña'. Scores of s'ivalingas are found in India, Nepal, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand with such s'ivalinga and ekamukha s'ivalinga of octagonal shape in rudra bhAga (middle). Images of such lingas of octagonal shape in rudra bhAga are presented for ready reference.
On some linga-s mukha 'face' is ligatured in the middle of the linga -- the rebus Meluhha reading is: mũh 'face' rebus: mũhe 'ingot' rebus: muhã 'quantity of metal produced at one time in a native smelting furnace.'

From Binjor (4MSR) on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati, a yajña kuNDa with an अष्टादि 'having eight corners' (Vedic) yupa (brick pillar) was discovered in April 2015 by a young team of students from Institute of Arcaheology, National Museum, New Delhi led by Dr. Sanjay Manjul.
The yupa is a conclusive evidence of Veda culture in the Binjor (4MSR) site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. This is specially described in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa & Rigveda.
The key expressions on the Mulavarman Yupa inscription (D.175) are in Samskritam and one fragment reads: yaṣṭvā bahusuvarṇakam; tasya yajñasya yūpo ‘yam. This means "from yaṣṭi to possess many gold pieces; this Yupa is a commemoration of that yajna."

A remarkable discovery is the octoganal brick which is a yaṣṭi.in a fire-altar of Bijnor site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. Thi yaṣṭi attests to the continuum of the Vedic tradition of firealtars venerating the yaṣṭi as a baton, skambha of divine authority which transforms mere stone and earth into metal ingots, a manifestation of the cosmic dance enacted in the furnace/smelter of a smith.
Vajapeya is one of 7 samstha (profession) for processing/smelting soma (a mineral, NOT a herbal): सोमः [सू-मनष Uṇ.1.139]-संर्स्ा a form of the Soma-sacrifice; (these are seven:- अदिष्टोम ,
अत्यदिष्टोम , उक्थ , षोढशी, अदिरात्र , आप्तोयााम and वािपेय). The Vajapeya performed in Binjor and
Balibangan should have been related to the Soma-samstha: सोमः संर्स्ा specified as वािपेय with the shape of the yupa with eight- or four-angles.

At the Vājapeya, the yūpa is eight-angled (as in Binjor), corresponding to the eight quarers (Sat.Br. V.2.1.5 aSTās'rir yūpo bhavati) असि [p= 114,2] f. the sharp side of anything , corner ,

The shape seen commonly in all the shapes of yupa of Isapur is that they are octagonal (eight angles). The shape matches with the drawing based on Vedic texts by Madeleine Biardeau (See slide image given below).

The vedic text which specifies the octagonal shape of the yupa is Satapatha Brahmana.
Sbr. V.2.1.9: While setting up the ladder, the yajñika says to his wife, 'Come, let us go up to Heaven'. She answers, 'Let us go up'. (Sbr V.2.1.9) and they begin to mount the ladder. At the top, while touching the head of the post, the yajñika says: 'We have reached Heaven' (Taittiriya Samhita, SBr. Etc.) 'I have attained to heaven, to the gods, I have become immortal' (Taittiriya samhita 1.7.9) 'In truth, the yajñika makes himself a ladder and a bridge to reach the celestial world' (Taittiriya Samhita VI.6.4.2)
Eggeling' translation of Sbr. Pt III, Vol. XLI, Oxford, 1894, p.31 says: “The post is either wrapped up or bound up in 17 cloths for Prajapati is 17-fold.' The top of the Yupa carries a wheel called cas'Ala in a horizontal position. The indrakila too is adorned with a wheel-ike object made of white cloth, but it is placed in a vertical position.
The metalwork evidences reported from Binjor by Sanjay Manjul and his team of students from the Institute of Archaeology, New Delhi, attest to the wealth-producing activities at this industrial site of Binjor of the Bronze Age on the Sarasvati River Basin.
Considering that the Vedic River Sarasvati together with River Sindhu were navigable waterways, the links and interactions with Mesopotamia and Ancient Near East can be explained as trade transactions by seafaring Meluhha merchants and artisans. The five seals which document the metalwork and trade transactions are as follows:

Functions of 19 Yūpas from ca. 100 CE are a continuum of bahusuvárṇaka in Binjor, ca 2500 BCE (?) Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/pvr24zq
Functions of 19 Yūpas from ca. 100 CE are a continuum of the bahusuvárṇaka functions archaeologically attested in Binjor octagonal yupa + Indus Script seal + fire-altar, ca 2500 BCE (?)
This monograph argues for the continuum of functions attested in Binjor (Rajasthan) fire-altar (+ an octagonal Yūpa+Indus Script seal) with the functions revealed on yupa inscriptions of historical periods starting from 102 CE, mostly in sites of Rajasthan and in East Borneo (Mulawarman yupa inscriptions).
Yupa inscriptions and ancient texts refer to yajna-s (sattras) as bahusuvárṇaka, producers of gold, of wealth. This is matched by the archaeological evidence of inscription on an Indus Script seal discovered at Binjor (Anupgarh, Rajasthan) site related to Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization, ca. 2500 BCE (?)
The Binjor fire-altar with an embedded octagonal yupa of brick accompanied by an Indus Script seal also produces evidence of BahusuvarNaka, great wealth produced by artisans of the civilization working with smelters/furnaces and in smithy/forge.
The name of the sattra performed by Mulawarman (400 CE) is of significance; it was called bahuhiraNya, a kind of Soma sacrifice. BahusuvarNaka is an expression which occurs in Valmiki Ramayana in reference to Rama's yajna and Meghanada's sattra or yajna.

22
The dakshiNas which accompany the sattras detailed in Yupa inscriptions may also reasonably be related to the production and sharing of wealth produced by working with fire-altars. If Soma was NOT a herbal but a mineral, such as electrum or gold-silver compound in mAkshika, 'pyrites', if ams'u is cognate with ancu (Tocharian) signifying 'iron', it is also reasonably inferred that the products worked on with fire-altars might have included dhAtu, minerals and metals.
Isapur Yupa inscription (102 CE, dated in year 24 in Kushana king Vasishka's reign) indicates performance of a sattra (yajna) of dvadasarAtra, 'twelve nights'. (Vogel, JP, The sacrificial posts of Isapur, Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India, 1910-11: 40-8).
See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/12/yupa-inscriptions-document-yajna-sfire.html?view=classic
Chhabra provides a succinct account of the 19 yupa inscriptions known in 1947. (B.CH. CHHABRA, Yupa Inscriptions, in: Jean Ph. Vogel, 1947,India antiqua, Brill Archive, pp.77-82).
Of the 19 yupa inscriptions, nine are from Rajasthan, five are from East Borneo (Indonesia) and the rest from regions such as Mathura and Allahabad. The list of 19 yupa inscriptions is as follows:
1 Isapur Mathura, 102 CE 2 Kosam-Allahabad 125 CE 3-4 Nandasa Udaipur 225 CE 5 Barnala Jaipur 227 CE 6-8 Badva Kotah 238 CE 9 Badva Kotah 238 CE 10 Nagar Jaipur 264 CE 11 Barnala Jaipur 278 CE 12 Bijayagarh Bharatpur 371 CE 13-16 Koetei Borneo 400 CE 17-19 Koetei Borneo 400 CE



23
A significant fact to be underscored is that most of the Yupa inscriptions are from Rajasthan point to the geographical locus of over 80% of sites Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization, which are on the basin of Vedic River Sarasvati.

Thus, the text of Indus Script inscription on the Binjor Seal reads: 'metallic iron alloy implements, hard alloy workshop' PLUS the hieroglyphs of one-horned young bull PLUS standard device in front read rebus:
kõda 'young bull, bull-calf' rebus: kõdā 'to turn in a lathe'; kōnda 'engraver, lapidary'; kundār 'turner'.
Hieroglyph: sã ghāṛɔ 'lathe'.(Gujarati) Rebus: sangara 'proclamation. Together, the message of the Binjor Seal with inscribed text is a proclamation, a metalwork catalogue (of) 'metallic iron alloy implements, hard alloy workshop' .
The second significant fact is that almost all the yupas are square below and octagonal above (with the exception of Nandsa Yupa which is round throughout).
The octagonal nature of the top of the yupa is consistent with the octagonal yupa of SarasvatiSindhu civilization ca 2500 BCE (subject to validation by carbon 14 dating) site of Binjor discovered in March 2015. This is an emphatic indicator of the Vedic cultural continuum from the days of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization to the historical periods reported by the 19 yupa inscriptions which celebrate the Vedic tradition of yajna-s.
Based on the decipherment of the seal with Indus Script inscription, the fire-altar of Binjor is relatable to the functions of a furnace to produce the metalwork detailed in the inscription on the seal.
The first hieroglyph-multiplex on the Binjor seal is comparable to an identical hieroglyphmultiplex on another seal of the civilization m305 Mohenjodaro:
m 305 Seal. Mohenjo-daro.

Fish + scales, aya ã ̄ s (amśu) ‘metallic stalks of stone ore’. Vikalpa: badhoṛ ‘a species of fish with many bones’ (Santali) Rebus: baḍhoe ‘a carpenter, worker in wood’; badhoria ‘expert in working in wood’(Santali)
gaNDa 'four' Rebus: khaNDa 'metal implements' Together with cognate ancu 'iron' the message is: native metal implements.
Hieroglyph: aya 'fish' Rebus: aya, ayas 'iron, metal'

Thus the octagonal yupa of Binjor together with the seal containing a metalwork catalogue is a precursor to the yupa vedic yajna tradition recorded in 9 yupa inscriptions of Rajasthan.
The form and function of a Yupa is recognized from ancient texts, for exampe, the Brahmana adhyaya of the BhumikANDa of YadavaprakAza's Vaijayanti, a Samskritam lexicon:
“While a yupa is a consecrated sacrificial post, a homayupa is one that is set up at sacrifices only for the sake of decoration. The two yupas that flank every fire at sacrifices are known by the



27
name Upastha. Whatever, yupa and the like, stands in front of the fire, is called Agnishtha. The middle and the top of a yupa are called SamAdAn and Tarman respectively. The quoit or the ring near the top is kown as ChashAla. The rough unhewn bottom part of a yupa is called Tupara. Its girdle is known as ParivyANa, and wrappings KumbA. If a yupa is seventeen cubit long, these seventeen cubits, from bottom upwards, are designated Methika, UttrAsa, Svarurmochana, Anjana, Vaijathita, KshAlana, Savas'Irshaka, Sudhanva, Rathagaruta, S'aikhAlika, Karanjaka Vasava, VaishNava, TvAShTra, Saumya, Madhura, and Vejana respectively.”
Chhabra cites a description from Valmiki Ramayana of an As'vamedha and explains that 21 yupas ( 3 groups of seven each) were decorated in front of as many fire-altars during the great yajna, likened to the seven rishis (constellation of Ursa Major consisting of seven stars). They were in the nature of decorative, beautifying, commemorative pillars.
The yajna-s recorded are: dvAdas'arAtra, Saptasomasamstha, ekashashtirAtra, trirAtra, aptoryAman, puNDarIka and so forth. On inscriptions of Yupas Nos. 5 and 10, the reference is to a sattra. Yupa Nos. 6-9 and 11 reord gifts of cows and dakShiNA which is s'raddha vittam, earnings for discplined work. Mulawarman's Yupa inscriptions of East Borneo record gifts to brahmanas of cows, bulls, land, lamps, ghree, sesame seeds and so on as mahAdAnas mentioned in the PurANas.

Yupa inscriptions are a continuum of the Indus Script tradition of documenting metalwork catalogues with documentation of wealth distributed to the participants and performers of specific Yajna-s such as as'vamedha, agniSToma. This continuum lends credence to the possibility that Soma yajna did not involve a herbal but a mineral consistent with the synony of Soma, ams'u which has a Tocharian cognate, ancu, 'iron'.

Wilhelm von Hevesy wrote about the Finno-Ugric-Munda kinship, like "Munda-Magyar-Maori, an Indian link between the antipodes new tracks of Hungarian origins" and "Finnisch-Ugrisches aus Indien". (DRIEM, George van: Languages of the Himalayas: an ethnolinguistic handbook. 1997. p.161-162.) Sumerian-Ural-Altaic language affinities have been noted. Given the presence of Meluhha settlements in Sumer, some Meluhha glosses might have been adapted in these languages. One etyma cluster refers to 'iron' exemplified by meD (Ho.). The alternative suggestion for the origin of the gloss med 'copper' in Uralic languages may be explained by the word meD (Ho.) of Munda family of Meluhha language stream:

One suggestion is that corruptions from the German "Schmied", "Geschmeide" = jewelry. Schmied, a smith (of tin, gold, silver, or other metal)(German) result in med ‘copper’.
The remrkable feature of the Yupa inscriptions are that they are in Samskritam. Patanjali comments on the nature of mleccha mispronunciations in the context of evaluation of such inscriptions in Samskritam.
Seals have also been found on the fire-altars associated with the Yupa inscriptions.
This feature of the presence of seals in fire-altars and the use of inscribed Yupa is traceable to the inscribed Kaluban terracotta cake detailed at http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/12/kalibangan-terracotta-cake-hieroglyphs.html The Kalibangan terracotta cake recorded Indus Script hieroglyphs which signfied
bhaTa 'warrior' rebus: bhaTa 'furnace' kolmo 'rice plant' rebus: kolimi 'smithy, forge' koD 'horn' rebus: koD 'workshop'
kola 'tiger' rebus: kolle 'blacksmith', kolhe 'smelter' kol 'working in iron'
Thus, the terracotta cake inscription signifies a iron workshop smelter/furnace and smithy.
This Indus Script tradition of inscribed records as metalwork catalogues on seals and terracotta cakes continues in the historical periods as Yupa inscriptions of Rajasthan and Indonesia detailing the types of yajna-s performed commemorated by the Yupa inscriptions.



31
The Yupa inscriptions are recorded on large-sized yaSTi of the type found in Binjor, Kalibangan, Lothal.
Indus Script Corpora are catalogues of metalwork recorded in mleccha, the spoken version of later-day languages of Indian Sprachbund. Yupa Inscriptions are records of yajna-s performed in Samskritam, the litearary version of later-day languages of Indian Sprachbund.
This continuum of fire-worship tradition evidenced by metalwork catalogues and fire-worship in Yajna-s points to the possibility that some of the yajna-s were metalwork processes involving fire-altars and producing varieties of metals such as soma (electrum) or gold (suvarNam); inscriptions indicate that wealth was distributed by yajamAna or rulers such as GajAyana SarvatAta or Pushyamitra, to the priests and participants of the yajna-s.
One Yupa inscription of Mulavarman, Kutai kingdom, Indonesia refers to suvarNam, gold. Candi-Sukuh inscribed Sivalinga (6 ft. tall Yupa) may also be evaluated in this tradition of metalwork since the Candi-Sukuh linga has an inscription which refers to Gangga sudhi 'purification by portable furnace, kanga'.
According to the Allahabad Yupainscription, in 2nd century CE, a village was assigned by the king to a minister who donated it to a priest. (Epigraphia Indica, (EI), XXVII, no. 43, lines 8-9, also see cf. EI, XXIV, no. 34, p. 252).
“Patanjali deplores the barbarisms of his time, for example, the 'wrong' words for 'cow' (gAvI, goNI, gotA, gopotalikA), which he includes among the 'many debased' (apabhrams'a) forms of the 'few' correct words. Based on the evidence of the inscriptions, this describes the linguistic situation perfectly. Or, he complains about the wrong pronunciation of the three s-sounds of Sanskrit that had collapsed nearly everywhere in north India into one phoneme – a factor that, incidentally, again points to MathurA, where it is seen in inscriptions of brahmins. His advice therefore is not to talk like the barbarians (mleccha). The Sanskrit of his time is exemplified by the first known Sanskrit inscription, the Ayodhya stone inscription (Sircar 1965: 94 no. 9), which is a ittleFrom the beginning of our era (S'o(m)DAsa, circa 1 to 25 CE, Sircar 1965: 114 sqq, Luders, 1961), the Mathura stone inscription (Sircar no 26) or the Kushana time Isapur Yupa inscription (Sircar 1965: 149 no. 47A).”(Austin Patrick Olivelle, 2006, Between the empires: society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE, OUP, USA).
“In the Mahabhashya, Patanjali refers to sacrifices performed for...iha Pushyamitram
YajayAmah: 'here we perform the sacrifices for Pushyamitra'. This is supported by the Ayodhya inscription of Dhanadeva (JBORS, X, p. 203 I,2), which records the performance of two As'vamedha sacrifices by Pushyamitra and the MalavikAgnimitra of Kalidasa. The Mahabhashya also refers to different types of sacrifices – AgnishToma, RajasUya, Vajapeya, and the domestic ones – Pakayajna or Panchayajna, accessories needed in such sacrifices, their duration, the benefits that accrued from their performances, and lastly, the priests required for them, who received



32
handsome dakshiNAs. Patanjali also mensions the Yupas, which were associated with Vedic sacrifices. The S'unga-SAtavAhana-S'aka Period. During this period, sacrifices were performed, and the yupas (sacrificial posts) were erected at important places...In the second or first century BCE, GajAyana SarvatAta performed an As'vamedha sacrifice at MadhyamikA (EI, XVI, p.27; EI, XXIII, p.198). From the NandsA yupa inscription of VS 282 (226 CE)(EI, XXVII, pp.252 ff; IHQ, XXIX, p.80), it is known that the Malava leader Nandisoma of the Sogin clan, performed the EkashashTirAtra sacrifice to proclaim the independence of his republic. From the BarNAla inscription f 228 CE, it is known that a king, whose name ended in Varddhana, erected seven yupas (EI, XXVI, pp. 118ff.) The reference to the group of seven yupas may show that the king had performed seven sacrifices. Another yupa inscription foud here, commemorates a sacrifice performed fifty-one years later. This inscription, of 279 CE, commemorates the performance of five TrirAtra, or perhaps GargatrirAtra, sacrifices by a BrAhmaNa. The Maukharis of BaDvA also championed the Vedic religion. In 293 CE, MahAsenApati Bala and his three sons performed a TrirAtra sacrifice (EI, XXIII, pp. 42-52). From the inscription of VakATaka copper plates, it is known that the BhAras'ivas under BhavanAga performed as many as ten as'vamedhas and won the Ganges water by their prowess. KP Jayaswal rightly concluded that they must have flourished from about the beginning of the third century CE, and celebrated their As'vamedhas to commemorate their conquest of the Gangetic valley, after the expulsion of the KushANas. (History of India, 150-350 CE). At Vidis'A, the remains of some olf YajnakuNDas or sacrificial pits of the second or third century CE have been discovered, and they prove that Vidis'a was a great centre of the Vedic religion. (ASI, 1914-15, p.75). These are of exceptional interest because nowhere else have such remains been found. Near them, two drains were found, connected with the sacrificial pits. On the levels of the KuNDas and the brick pavement, the walls of two structures were discovered, which were intended to be spacious halls constructed for accommodating a large number of people gathered for sacrifice. These sacrifices instituted by kings or wealthy YajamAnas of the ancient times lasted for months, and some for years, and for their adequate performance, halls of permanent structure were as much a necessity as the kuNDas themselves. A sacrificial site was always a meeting place for Rishis, Yajnikas and distinguished guests of the sacrificer. The hall excavated in the south of the KuNDas served the purpose of a dining hall or for feasting, and the other huge and extensive hall was meant for the carrying on of philosophical debates. Some seals connected with the sacrificial site have been discovered. On some of them, the words hotA, potA and mantra, which are technical to sacrificial literature, have been carved. The sealings have been classified under four heads, viz., – 1) rulers,



33
2) officials, 3) private individuals, and 4) passport. Only two seals of the first class were found. One of these gives the name of Vis'vAmitra as the name of a ruler not so far known from any epigraphic or literary source. Of the three sealings of the second class, two belong to two different daNDanAyakas or police officers, and one to an officer haya-hasty-adhikArI (in charge of elephants and horses). There are also seals of private individuals. All these persons were followers of the Vedic religion. The seals of passport were meant for admitting persons to the sacrificial hall.”(Kailash chand Jain, 1972, Malwa through the ages, from the earliest times to 1305 AD', Dehi, Motilal Banarsidass, pp 192-194).
Mulawarman Yupa inscriptions
“The first yupa inscription of Mulavarman was erected to commemorate a bahu-suvarnaka sacrifice,'that on which gold is spent in profusion'. If the inscription can be taken literally, it points up the value of gold in the Southeast Aian world fo the fifth century. Another records that Mulavarman 'had given a gift (dAnam) of a thousand kine and a score the twice-born (i.e. the brAhmaNas)....(consequently) for that deed of merit (puNyasya) thi sacrificial post (yupo) has been made...A third inscription is similar: 'Let the foremost amongst the priests and whatsoever other pious men (there be) hear of the meritorious deed (puNyam) of Mulavarman the king of illustrious and resplendent fame – (let them hear) of his gret gift (bahudAna), his gift of cattle (?)(jivadAna), his gift of a wonder-tree (kalpavRkSam), hs gift of land (bhUmidAna). For these multitudes of pious deeds (puNyaganam) this sacrificial post has been set up by the priests.' It is the duty of men of prowess to give liberally of their substance so as to acquire greater wealth and status, thereby initiating an endless cycle of giving at all levels of society. It is also imperative that these meritorious deeds be properly recorded. In the second and third inscriptions, there is an expressed linkage between the giving of gifts (dAna) and the acquisition of merit (puNya). To record these pious acts a sacrificial post (yupa) was erected. What we have, then, is action on the temporal plane that was meant to have eternal impact in the sense that Mulavarman was building his field of
merit.” (Robert S. Wicks, 1992, Money, markets and trade in early Southeast Asia: the
development of indigenous monetary systems to AD 1400, SEAP Publications, Cornell, Ithaca, NY, p.245; loc. Cit. Mulavarman's First Yupa Inscription; FH van Naerssen, and RC longh, The economic and administrative history of early Indonesia, Leiden: Brill, 1977), p. 20; J. Ph.

“Kutai Kingdom was the oldest Hindu Kingdom in Indonesia placed in Muara Karman, East Borneo. This inscription formed Yupa, a stone pillar that is used to bind the victim in the form of animals or humans to be sacrificed to the gods. There are seven Yupa which contains the inscription, but only 4 were successfully read and translated. This inscription use Pallawa Pre

Nagari letters and in Sanskrit, which is estimated from the shape and type dating from around 400 AD.
... Contents of Mulawarman Inscription
Fill Yupa first inscription mentions that the first king of the kingdom of Kutai is Kudungga. Kudungga which is the original name of Indonesia at that time showed that he was not the founder of the royal family. Additionally, Yupa mention also that during the reign of Asmawarman in Kutai Kingdom Aswamedha ceremony held. This ceremony is a ceremony of release of the horse to determine the boundaries of the empire Kutai.
Mulwarman Inscription I
The Maharaja Kundunga, very noble, has a son of the renowned, namely the Aswawarman, which like the Amshuman (sun god) grow very noble family. The Aswawarman have three sons, such as fire (holy) three. Leading off the third son is the Mulawarman, civilized king good, strong and powerful. The Mulawarman has held receptions (salvation called) gold very much. Create a memorial feast (salvation) that stone monument was established by the brahmins.
A Yupa with inscription in the National Museum of Indonesia in Jakarta
Overall, contents of Mulawarman Inscription tell about Mulawarman that contribute to the Brahmans form the many cows. Mulawarman mentioned as the grandson of Kudungga, and children from Aswawarman. This inscription is evidence of the oldest of the Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia. Kutai name is commonly used as the name of this kingdom though not mentioned in the inscription, because the inscriptions found in Kutai, precisely in the upper Mahakam River. Mulawarman Inscription IV
The Mulawarman, the noble king and foremost, giving alms 20,000 cows to the the brahmins who such as fire, (located) in the holy land (named) Waprakeswara. Create (warning) will favor the king's goodness, this monument was created by the Brahmins who came to this place.

The + shape of these fire altars is consistent with the description provided in Mānava Śulbasūtra for a Caturaśra Śyena, or "four-sided falcon." The procedure is described lucidly by Patrick A. George in the following post for UPenn at http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/george/vedi.html (reproduced below for ready reference) चतुर् --ि mf(आ)n. four-cornered , quadrangular Ka1tyS3r. Kaus3. Pa1n2. 5-4 , 120 Hariv.12378 &c; quadrangular figure; a square (Monier-Williams).
The text indicates how the body of the Śyena 'falcon' is constructed as a square with the two wings, head and tail added in proportionately to the sizes of wings, head and tail of the falcon; such a construction described in the text (shown in a figure below) is consistent with the shape of the fire-altar shown on Mohenjo-daro seal m2094.
Ujjain Symbol with four arms is also a variant of the shape of the fire-altar shown on m2094 with each of the four arms ligatured with a dotted circle which has a unique Meluhha signifier expression: dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron smelter’.
In order that the four limbs of the falcon do not break away from the body, structural integrity is maintained by overlapping layers with different arrangements of bricks. The bricks of the first, third, and fifth layers of the Caturasra Shyena altar are are constructed with three different bricks in the following quantities and sizes, where a = angula:



47
• 110 30a x 30a • 85 12a x 12a • 5 12a x 6a The second, and fourth layers of the Caturasra Shyena altar are constructed with four different bricks in the following quantities and sizes:



48
• 110 30a x 30a • 75 12a x 12a • 10 12a x 6a • 5 18a x 12a The square 'body' of the altar may thus also be described as an 8 x 8 grid, a pattern which is most apparent in the arrangement of bricks in layers 1, 3, and 5. This 8 x 8 grid is proportionally equivalent to the plans of Indian temples, and the areas enclosed by the representations of walls in tantric yantras and mandalas.

Ujjain symbol found in potsherd of Surkotada site from Harappan civilization.
Coins from Ujjain depicting the famous 'Ujjaini symbol' [a], which is a really frequent symbol from coins and seals of central-west India during early historic period (~200 BCE).Same symbol could be traced back to the Harappan period [b]. It is also seen in other Chalcolithic cultures like from Navdatoli [c]. It may have been a regional/tribal symbol from Harappan era which survived till early historic era. https://www.facebook.com/groups/416065382227600/permalink/585214385312698/

Smelting or ore purification process occurs in a pot-kiln or in an enclosed space of a deep pit.
The Ujjain symbol of four dotted circles on four arms of a + hieroglyph, on
early coins of Ancient India provide the leads to decipher the semantics in Meluhha of hieroglyphs/hypertexts as signifiers of smelting processes and smithy/forge processes to produce ingots or metalware,wealth of a nation. This Ujjain symbol on coins of ca. 3rd/4th cent. BCE are derived from a hieroglyph registered on a Rojdi potsherd of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization ca. 3rd millennium BCE. A modification of the + symbol is the svastika showing the unique processes of sublimation of zinc in retorts; the sign is read rebus: sattva 'svastika symbol' rebus: sattva 'zinc'.
Proving that Svastika is NOT a syllable, but hypertext of logo-semantic Indus Script. History of svastika and its use on metalwork wealth-accounting ledgers https://tinyurl.com/y69rudws Thus, svastika symbol signifies the unique process for sublimating zinc ore. https://www.facebook.com/groups/416065382227600/ "Rojdi is an archaeological site belonging to the Indus valley civilization. It is located on the northern bank of the Bhadar River in Gondal taluka of Rajkot district in central Saurashtra peninsula of Gujarat state in India. It was continuously occupied from 2500 BCE to 1700 BCE...The pottery often has graffiti with signs from the Indus script, such as jar sign. There is also a short inscription in Harappan writing on the rim of a potshred. Five (four complete and one broken) copper or bronze flat axes were found, all belonged to Rojdi C period." .https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojdi

Typologically this type departs further from the Mauryan prototype towards the typical local Ujjain 'Shiva type'. On that type Shiva will henceforth occupy the dominant position to which the associated symbols are subordinated. As can be seen below these associated symbols are frequently still the same as on the Mauryan prototype, particularly sun and six-armed symbol. This coin is still punchmarked in contrast to the subsequent types which are all die-struck, but the symbol arrangement on the coin flan is already more a composition than a randomly done application of punches. On the reverse the 'bale-mark' is still maintained but now it is accompanied by the Ujjain symbol. In the further development the 'bale-mark' will disappear and the Ujjain symbol alone will become the reverse emblem of the whole series. Ujjain: Shiva types

Human depictions on ancient Indian coins are of special interest, as they are among India's earliest representations of deities in anthropomorphic form and thus most important for the study of their iconographic development. The earliest such depictions on coins appear on some of the punchmarked silver karshapanas of the Mauryan kings during the 4th/3rd century BCE. The deities on these early silver coins have been identified as crested Shiva holding danda (stick) and kamandalu (water-pot), as ithyphallic Shiva on one rare type from the Jan Lingen collection, as chakra (discus-weapon) holding Vaishnavite deity Vasudeva-Krishna or as plough holding Balarama. A number of female figures on some of these silver karshapana types have been regarded as Matrikas. And a unique silver karshapana from the Pieper collection depicts a chakra holding Vaishnavite deity / Vishnu together with what appears to be the earliest depiction of a Garuda.
On the local Ujjain coins with human depictions on them, these are in most cases single human figures, standing, squatting, dancing or sitting, representing various Hindu gods and goddesses. Different researchers have tried to identify them and have frequently come to divergent conclusions. The matter is not simple as in this early stage of iconography the depiction of many deities together with their characteristic symbols and attributes was not yet fully developed and sometimes different deities were even associated with the same symbols. The latest approach to the subject is Devendra Handa's brilliant paper on 'Divinities on Ujjain Coins', ICS-NL 51, 2013' who clarified controversies on some deities and originally proposed the identification of others. The most prominent figure on these coins is ceratainly Shiva Mahakala whose cult was very important at Ujjain, and Lakshmi who experienced a general adoration by believers of different cults who wouldn't have hesitated to beg assistance from the goddess of wealth, prosperity and fortune.
But apart from Shiva and Lakshmi there are several other deities who are depicted on the coins of ancient Ujjain, such as Karttikeya, Shashthi, Vasudhara, Krishna, Brahma and others, according to the well-founded identifications of Devendra Handa. Further details will be given with the respective coin descriptions below. Handa refers to some coins published by Sethi depicting a male human figure which either holds a bull or cow by its horn, or which drives a bull/ cow holding a stick in his hand, and proposes to identify this figure as Gopala Krishna (ICS-NL, no.51, pp.25-26). In the same context he proposes to regard another figure as a Krishna depiction as well: this figure appears on a coin published by Kothari which shows a dancing male figure with fan-shaped hairdress holding a flute-like object. Kothari's coin type 252 is seen by Handa as a depiction of Karttikeya (ICS-NL, 51, p.31); the deity is holding shakti (lance) and kamandalu (water-pot) and shows five protrusions of the head-gear as a "representation of sixheaded Karttikeya." In a similar way goddess Shashthi is identified by Handa on another Ujjain coin type depicted as a multi-headed female figure as indicated by the dotted marks around her head. The 'fish-holding deity' was already described by V.S. Agrawala as a representation of Vasudhara who is the consort of Jambhala- the Buddhist god of wealth.
A few early copper coins of the Ujjain region with three standing/ walking human figures on them are of special interest. Combining the evidence of the specimens at his disposal Devendra Handa identified this group of three figures, a female figure in the center with a bow-holding male figure on each side, as the earliest numismatic depictions of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana datable to the 2nd/ 1st century BC (ICS-NL, no.51, pp.29-30). "The dress of the female figure compares very well with the dress of numerous human figures which figure on Ujjain coins and

leaves little doubt to its being an indigenous piece of the area. The three figures with two males holding the bows seem to represent Rama, Sita and Lakshmana going in the forest and recall to our mind the description given in the Valmiki Ramayana".
UJJAIN diverse deities
Ujjain, anonymous AE 3/8 karshapana, 'seated Lakshmi type'
Weight: 3.18 gm., Diameter: 16 mm. Seated Lakshmi with feet parallel to each other, right hand on leg and left hand raised holding lotus flower. Ujjain symbol. Reference: Pieper 304 (plate coin) / BMC pl.XXXVIII, no.25 Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu, is the goddess of fortune, wealth and prosperity and one of the most popular divinities from the Hindu pantheon. Incarnations of Vishnu are Rama and Krishna, as incarnations of Lakshmi are Sita (Rama's wife) and Radha (Krishna's lover). Lakshmi has a special association to the lotus flower which stands for growth and fertility- so much that even the world is said to be continually reborn from a lotus which comes out of the navel of Vishnu.
Ujjain, anonymous AE 3/8
karshapana, 'abisheka-Lakshmi txpe'



66
Weight: 3.10 gm., Diameter: 15x11 mm. Lakshmi seated with feet parallel to each other, her right rests on her belly and her left on her leg; Lakshmi is flanked by two elephants which are sprinkling water on her head (abisheka Lakshmi). Reference: Pieper 305 (plate coin) / BMC pl.XXXVI, nos.4-5 Abisheka is a late Vedic rite originally performed by anointing government officials at special occasions. In Hindu worship the abisheka ritual is particularly connected with Lakshmi, though it is also performed by other believers. 'Rudraabisheka' for example is peformed on Shiva lingams. As can be seen on this coin Lakshmi is frequently depicted with two elephants adoring her by pouring water over her head.
Ujjain, anonymous AE 1/8 karshapana, 'fish
holding Vasudhara' Weight: 1.00 gm., Diameter: 8x8 mm. Standing goddess Vasudhara holding a pair of fish with her outstretched right, left hand akimbo.; standard on right. Ujjain symbol with extra circle in field. Reference: Pieper 295 (plate coin) The fish-holding goddess is known on coins and sculptural objects from Malwa, Vidarbha, Mathura, Kausambi and elsewhere and has been identified as Vasudhara, a goddess of wealth and auspiciousness. Like Lakshmi she was popular among traders and others who searched protection and promotion for their diverse activities. Handa emphasizes the symbolic importance of the pair of fish "as one of the eight mangalika-chihnas 'auspicious signs' in literature".
Central India, AE 1/8 karshapana,'fish
holding Vasudhara' Weight: 1.01 gm., Diameter: 8x8 mm. Standing goddess Vasudhara holding a pair of fish with her outstretched right, left hand akimbo; she wears large earrings and pinned up hair (as if wearing a vessel on her head); svastika on the top left. Lion standing to right Reference: Pieper 452 (plate coin)



67
The provenance of this and the next coin is uncertain but may be assumed to be in western Malwa or closely linked regions south of the Narmada.
Central India, AE 1/8 karshapana, 'fish
holding Vasudhara' Weight: 1.17 gm., Diameter: 11x8 mm. Standing goddess Vasudhara holding a pair of fish with her outstretched right, left hand akimbo; her hair is pinned up (as if wearing a vessel on her head; two crescent-like devices on the left. Tree Reference: Pieper 453 (plate coin)
Ujjain, AE 1/4 karshapanaa, 'snake
holding deity' Weight: 2.83 gm., Diameter: 11x11 mm. Frontally facing female figure, her left arm akimbo, her right raised hand holding an uncertain object; on the left is a curved object like a snake coming from a large basket that is standing at the bottom. Ujjain symbol. Reference: Pieper 296 (plate coin) It is possible that this is also a depiction of 'fish-holding' Vasudhara but there are some differences. The uplifted right is unusual and the fact that the deity would be holding one of the two fish directly in her hand seems to be unusual as well. Usually Vasudhara is holding the pair of fish with a string so that they are hanging below her outstretched hand. To me it looks more as if she was holding a snake in her hand and the curved object on left as well bears more resemblance to a snake. And the basket which is standing at the bottom reminds one of the baskets in which snake charmers keep their snakes. If this interpretation was true, the depicted figure might be a serpent goddess such as Manasa who is particularly worshipped in Bengal but also in other parts of northern and north-eastern India.

Ujjain, anonymous
AE 3/8 karshapana, 'Annapurna type' Weight: 3.17 gm., Diameter: 17x15 mm. Frontally standing female figure holding a vase or pot in her upraised right hand, left akimbo; 6-armed symbol on top left; horizontally placed Indradhvaja and taurine on bottom left; railed tree on right. Double-orbed Ujjain symbol. Reference: Pieper 294 (plate coin) /BMC pl.XXXVII, no.21 Handa suggested that the female on this coin may represent Annapurna (ICS-NL, 51, p.35). Annapurna is the Hindu goddess of nourishment, food, harvest and agriculture and hence very popular in the villages and rural regions of India. She is regarded as another form of Parvati, the consort of Shiva. Annapurna is depicted holding a bowl or pot filled with grain or other food. Her main temple stands in Varanasi but others are known at many other places among them a very famous one at Indore in Madhya Pradesh.

Reference: Pieper 300 (plate coin) Referring to depictions of six-headed Shashthi on some Yaudheya coins Devendra Handa takes the five dots around the main head of the female on this coin type as additional heads and identifies her as Shashthi on this Ujjain type as well (ICS-NL, 51, p.34).

In a note to the SACG website Shailendra Bhandare suggested the scene on this coin representing the mythical story of 'Balarama killing the ass demon' and the depiction seems to reflect that story indeed quite well- even if the deity on this coin has no specific Vaishnavite attributes. We are told that there had been a large grove where there were palmyras bearing delicious fruits. But nobody dared to go there because the site was guarded by Dhenuka, a demon in the form of an ass. Finally Balarama, inseparable companion of Krishna, killed the demon by crashing him against one of the palm trees. In his contribution to 'Between the Empires' Bhandare discusses the story of 'Balarama killing the ass-demon' in the context of the coinage of Erikachha where the palm-tree and ass had been characteristic coin devices. Typologically this coin type may thus rather belong to Erikachha than to Ujjain.
Ujjain,
anonymous AE, 'Brahma type' Weight: 2.84 gm., Diameter: 14x14 mm. Standing male figure holding long curved staff and kamandalu (water-pot) Ujjain symbol on top left and Brahmi legend 'bramha' on top right. Six-arched chaitya (hill/ multiarched structure) with indistict object on top; indistinct Brahmi legend below the chaitya . Reference: Pieper 410 (plate coin) In ICS-NL, no.50, p.31-32, Devendra Handa identified the deity on this coin type as Brahma as it is clearly indicated by the Brahmi legend on the right top corner of the obverse. Handa discusses the possibility that the object on top of the chaitya on reverse might be a swan (vahana or vehicle of Brahma) on post. Taking the chaitya symbol representing a temple in this case, it thus might be a temple dedicated to god Brahma. Brahma, creator of the universe, is part of the Hindu trinity together with Vishnu and Shiva. Although usually Brahma is represented as a four-armed deity with certain specific attributes, one cannot expect these features here, as the iconography was not yet developed that far and nowhere on these early coins do we see multi-armed deities. Staff and kamandalu (water-pot) are unspecific attributes which Brahma shares with other deities.

Ujjain symbol with a taurine in each orb. Reference: Pieper 302 (plate coin)/ BMC pl.XXXVI, nos.1-3 Several attempts have been made in the past to identify the two figures on this coin type. Amongst other explanations some researchers have tried to interpret the scene as representing the marriage of Shiva and Parvati but there is no clear evidence for any such definite attribution. In the abscence of any specific attributes one can only describe the scene as a depiction of a closely attached human couple.

UJJAIN, animal series
The most frequently seen animals on Ujjain coins are the bull, elephant, horse and lion, which occupied important places in the daily life and artwork of the people of India throughout the ages. The rich coinages of Ujjain present these animals sometimes in a simple form, in other cases in artistically high grade executions. Before opening the coin gallery a few words may be said on the symbolism and the extended meaning these animals carry.
BULL: The bull's domestication was an important step in the agricultural development of most ancient societies. In the case of India outstanding depictions of bulls had been engraved in prehistoric time on rocks and caves and later during the third and early second millenium BCE in outstanding form on many objects from Indus valley civilisation sites such as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. On early Indian coins, i.e. on some Mauryan karshapanas and certain local Deccan punchmarked types, we find the interesting depiction of yoked bulls drawing a ploughshare. The bull's vital role for human society, its strength, fertility and power soon raised it into a mythical



75
and religious context. Best known and well documented is the bull's association with the Hindu god Shiva serving as this god's vahana (mount) in the form of the magnificent bull Nandi, the son of Surabhi and Kasyapa. Its inclusion into religious and divine spheres soon secured the bull and cattle in general special respect, adoration and inviolability in Hindu society.
On the coins of ancient Ujjain the bull is mostly standing or walking to the right. Characteristically there are some associated symbols placed above the animal, among which the svastika, taurine, Indradhvaja, six-armed symbol, chakra or Ujjain symbol are the most frequently encountered, whereas other symbols such as vase or three-arched hill are rarely seen in association with the bull. In many instances the bull is facing a railed tree or very occasionally a railed yupa which is placed on the right.
ELEPHANT: The elephant was adored by Buddhists, Hindus and Jains. Even if the white elephant Airavata is mentioned as having been ridden by thunderbolt-wielding Indra it cannot be taken as Indra's vahana in the same close association as the bull is linked to Shiva. Indra rides Airavata when defeating Vrta, who appears as a dragon or huge snake causing drought by blocking the course of the rivers. Airavata sucks up the waters of the underworld and sprays them into the clouds, so that Indra can cause them to rain down thus ending the terrible drought on earth. This mythical story also emphasizes the elephant's close link to water and rain which is amply illustrated in abisheka depictions of elephants anointing the goddess Lakshmi. The elephant was used as a pack-animal and abused as a devastating weapon of war and in its power and matchless strength regarded as a symbol of royal authority. Its grandeur and noble character impressed people throughout the ages and diverse cults developed around it. One amongst many others is the famous story of Buddha entering the whomb of his mother Maya in his last incaarnation in the form of a white elephant.
LION: The outstanding position of the lion in Indian life, culture and art is vividly illustrated by the national Indian emblem, an adaptation of the lion capital of Ashoka at Sarnath (near Varanasi in UP) which is crowned by four lions standing on an abacus decorated with a frieze depicting an elephant, horse, lion and bull. In Buddhism lions are depicted as dharma protectors supporting the throne of lord Buddha and of bodhisattvas (followers of Buddha striving for enlightenment) symbolizing consistency, strength and wisdom. In Hindu mythology the lion appears as one of the avatars (personifications) of the god Vishnu. There was no threat and no enemy the 'king of the animals' had to fear and hence the lion's majesty and royalty are easily understandable attributes.
HORSE: The very important role the domesticated horse has always played in human society is self-evident. Horses, sometimes with wings and sometimes without, also had their parts in the myths of people all over the world. Uchchaihshravas, the legendary white, winged horse of Hindu mythology emerged from the ocean and was taken into heaven by Indra. Having removed its wings to prevent it from flying away Indra presented the horse to mankind. Speed, freedom, grace and beauty are attributes that immediately come to mind when thinking of horses. Depictions of horses drawing a chariot are known but extremely rare on coins of ancient India. There are 'horse type' coinages like the Malayaman, the Hiranjaka or the Suktimati coins where the horse occupies the dominant and largest element of the coin design. On the coins of Ujjain, however, the horse is rather a coequal part of a multi-symbol design.



76
Even a short comment on horses on Indian coins cannot conclude without mentioning the Vedic Ashvameda (horse-sacrifice) ritual. This unusual ceremony was the exclusive privilege of a king and was performed to celebrate a great victory or other very special event. The stallion, carefully chosen from the flock of the king, was set free to roam around for the time of one year during which it was followed by the king's army. Then the horse was brought back to the king's residence and the ceremony was performed. In its course the horse was tied to a sacrifical post and after a series of different rites, in which a great number of diverse animals were involved, the horse was slaughtered. Only very few ancient Indian kings such as Pushyamitra Sunga and Samudragupta are historically documented to have performed the Ashvameda ceremony and in the case of Samudragupta some famous gold coins bear witness to this event. Other claims to Ashvameda depictions on ancient Indian coins are mostly unbased or at least too unspecific to be sure about the depicted scene.

Rev.: Ujjain symbol with a dot in each angle. Reference: Pieper 366 (plate specimen) The makara is the vahana (mount) of Ganga, the goddess of the river Ganges, and of the sea-god Varuna. Its frontal part is that of a terrestrial animal, its hind part that of a sea-creature. The depiction of a creature with fish-tail and elephant's head, like on this coin, is frequently used in depictions of a makara.
The multi-symbol obverse designs of Ujjain's local copper coins document close affinities to those of the Mauryan silver karshapanas. As Allan rightly observed (BMC:cxiii): "They are struck on the same principle as the punch-marked coins; that is to say, on the obverse we have several symbols - often, as on the silver punch-marked coins, five, some of which change more frequently than others." This multi-symbol fashion with the single design elements having nearly the same size may help to date such coin types earlier than coin types with one large dominant design element which is accompanied by one or more small symbols.
Human and animal depictions on local Ujjain coins have been discussed and illustrated on the previous Ujjain pages. Inanimate, symbolic depictions most frequently occurring on Ujjain copper coins are the railed tree, chakra, six-armed symbol, svastika, taurine, Indradhvaja, srivatsa, river and fish-tank. A few other symbols like sun, wheel, tree-on-hill and railed lingam have to be added to this list but they are rarely seen. One is astonished to observe that the threearched hill symbol, which occupied a prominent place among the symbols on Mauryan karshapanas, is used on only a few Ujjain types. The dominant symbol here is of course the cross symbol with an orb attached at each end, the socalled Ujjain symbol. In a large form and as a single symbol it is used as the reverse mark of the local Ujjain coppers but as one among other symbols it also appears on many obverse types of this and many other ancient Indian coin series. The influence and the acceptance of Ujjain's coins has been so decisive that other authorities sometimes even marked their coins with the same reverse emblem as Ujjain itself - examples are some Erich types or certain types from Vidarbha. In that case a clear distinction is only possible by knowledge of findspots or a specific typology of the respective obverse design. Much has been speculated about origin and meaning of the Ujjain symbol. The most probable interpretation sees the symbol as symbolizing an important cultural, political and economical center where crossroads from all cardinal points met and emenated.

This is the first specimen to show at least the first three letters of the legend clear beyond doubt. Credit goes to Harry Falk to have read the legend as 'sidhato'. The second part of the name appears to have been correctly identified from the available specimens except for the last letter which still is somewhat doubtful but '...madana' is well possible. In that case the complete name would be 'Sidhathomadana'. [unquote]

There are two hieroglyphs in the dotted circle: 1. Dot; 2. Circle. The dot is an orthographic style to signify a strand (like a strand of thread inserted through a perforated bead). The circle hieroglyph also a livelihood activity, duty, office; the word is vatta ‘circle’ rebus:-ʻduty, office’ (Pali).
Thus, together, the hypertext of dotted ciecle signifies: dhã ̄ i 'strand' rebus: dhāū, dhāv m.f. ʻ a partic. soft red stoneʼ dhatu 'mineral ore' PLUS vaṭa'string' vaṭṭa 'circle' together rebus expression: dhāvaḍ 'smelter'.

Alishar Hüyük (in modern Yozgat Province, Turkey) was an ancient Near Eastern city. It is near the modern village of Alişar, Sorgun....Alishar Hüyük was occupied beginning in
the Chalcolithic Period, through the Bronze Age and the Hittites, and into Phrygian times. A number of Hittite-era cuneiform tablets in Old Assyrian of the Cappadocia type were found there. Mention in those tablets of the town Amkuwa has caused speculation that the site is the Ankuwa mentioned in other Hittite texts...The site was excavated between 1927 and 1932 by a team from the Oriental Institute of Chicago. The work was led by Erich Schmidt...About 12km northwest of Alishar Huyuk, there's another important archaeological site named Cadir Hoyuk (Çadır Höyük in Turkish alphabet).Recent excavators of Cadir Hoyuk have identified this site tentatively with the Hittite city of Zippalanda.Evidence of the first known settlement at Cadir Hoyuk has been radio-carbon dated to the Early Chalcolithic (5300-4500 BC); nevertheless the occupation may well be even earlier than that, and go back to Neolithic (ca. 5500 BC)...Cadir Hoyuk appears to have flourished during the Middle and Late Bronze Age (2000-1100 BC), continuing into the Iron Age.(I.

"Phyrgian painted pot (A65608) from the site of Alishar Huyuk in Turkey. The circles in the background behind the deer on the pot are thought by some scholars to be snow. " (Oriental Institute). I submit that the dotted circles are NOT snow but signifiers of dhā̆ vaḍ 'iron smelters’. The markhor is also an Indus Script hieroglyph: miṇḍā́ l 'markhor' rebus: meḍho a ram, a sheep rebus मृिु mṛdu, mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'metal', iron'. Thus the Phyrgian pot Indus Script hypertext signifies Meluhha iron smelters at work.
Indus Script Cipher explains the sign zero (circle) as a hypertext in Meluhha (Bhāratiya sprachbund, speech union) to signify vaṭṭa 'circle' rebus: baṭa 'iron'.
In the context of using the sign zero in place value notation, the same pair of homonyms (similar sounding words) signify: vaṭṭa 'circle' rebus: vartana 'interval or landing point in numeration'
Zero hieroglyph was chosen because it signifies hieroglyph: v ̥rttá ʻroundedʼ ŚBr. rebus: v ̥rttá ʻturnedʼ RV. The cognates in Bhāratīya sprachbund with pronunciation variations are: வட்டம் vaṭṭam Circle, circular form, ring-like shape; கிழரமவட்டம் kiḻamaivaṭṭam, n. < id. +. Week, as the cycle of seven kiḻamai;baṭṭa 'that is round' rebus: baṭṭa 'barrenness'. Given these semantics, the choice of sign zero as a circle reads: v ̥rttá 'turned' to signify a landing point or 'interval, vartana' of ten in numeration count on base 10.
A good example of the circle to signify baṭṭa 'that is round' is on this cylinder seal read rebus in Meluhha:

Kikkuli Hittite Text shows that Kikkuli was a Meluhha शहाणा śahāṇā 'expert' from Sarasvati Civilization We have seen that Kikkuli uses the expression vattana from Indo-Aryan (Meluhha, Bhāratīya sprachbund) to signify, 'intervals, rounds' in the context of horses put through paces of specific number of rounds during training. Kikkuli uses terms such as: Vedic eka-, tri-, pañcasapta-, nava-vartana. The numeral compounds used from Indo-Aryan are: aiga-, tera-, panza, satta-, nāwa-wartanna ("one, three, five, seven, nine intervals"). See:

The Hindu–Arabic numeral system, base-10. An ancient landing point in numeration is a count of ten which forms a set. Digits 1 to 9 gain their multiples of tens by the way they are positioned in a number. for example 10 signifies One Tens place 11 signifies One Tens place + numeral 1; 22 signifies Two tens place PLUS numeral 2; 123 signifies One Hundreds place + two tens place + numeral 3 Positional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place").
The word used for such placement system of counted numbers in Bhāratīya sprachbud (speech union) isvartana, vaṭṭa

Field Symbol 118 is ‘dotted circle’. Field Symbol figure 123 These hypertexts are also likely to be related to the orthography (and semantics) of ‘dotted circle +
string’. Field Symbol figure 123 is associated with a ‘portable furnace’ indicating the possibility of production of ‘crucible steel’.
These signs (ASI 1977 Mahadevan corpus) may be semantic variants of the ‘dotted circle+ string’ orthography of Sign 397.
Sign 397 dhāī 'strand' PLUS vata, 'string'; together, the expression is: a dotted circle + string which signifies dhā̆ vaḍ ''iron-smelter' who performs the act of purification to win the wealth, the metal from mere earth and stone -- replicating the immeasurability of cosmic phenomena. This symbol is worn on the fillets of the Mohenjo-daro priest (on his forehead and on his right shoulder).
