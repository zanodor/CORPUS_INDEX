ABSTRACT
The goddess Ištar is a complex and varied figure within ancient Near Eastern
culture. Despite having been the subject of much modern scholarship, Ištar’s
contradictory nature is poorly understood. The goddess is examined in general works
on Mesopotamia, such as Oppenheim’s Ancient Mesopotamia, Portrait of a Dead
Civilisation and Bottéro’s ReligionsinAncientMesopotamia, though often not in any
great detail. Few shorter articles have looked more closely at Ištar’s nature and
diversity, notably Inanna- Ištar as Paradox and a Coincidence of Opposites by
Rikvah Harris. Thorkild Jacobsen also addressed the theme of Ištar as a figure of
variety in his general work, TreasuresofDarkness. This study attempts to bridge the
gap in current scholarship found between textual translation and criticism, and
discussion on the nature of the goddess. Existing discussions such as those found in
the work of Jacobsen and Harris include textual evidence, but rarely extensive textual
commentary. This study examines Ištar through three important hymns and prayers,
the corpus of Assyrian oracle texts and a poem known as Agushaya. These texts
provide insight into how Ištar was viewed by the people who worshipped her and the



relationship between goddess and devotees. Consideration is given to recurring
themes within the texts as well as the wider body of literature referring to Ištar.
The purpose of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the multi
faceted character of the goddess, through examining her depiction in different types
of texts. By juxtaposing examples from a variety of genres in a previously untried
fashion, Ištar’s diversity is illustrated fully and can be acknowledged as central to her
identity.

INTRODUCTION
Mesopotamian religion is something that is challenging to define.
'Mesopotamia' spans several cultures, a large geographical area and a
correspondingly large time-span. Whilst there are striking similarities between the
religions of the region, with many of them sharing a common mythological heritage,
there are also distinct differences. In his authoritative work, Ancient Mesopotamia:
Portrait of a Dead Civilisation, Oppenheim argues that a history of Mesopotamian
religion should not be written.1 The rationale behind this statement is that the sources
are complex and cannot be fully understood across the cultural and chronological
barriers. Despite this assertion, Oppenheim provides a full account of known religious
practises and beliefs in Mesopotamia. This work has been taken as a point of
orientation for basic information contained within this introduction. As there is no
room to include a general chronological and cultural framework in the present study,
the reader is directed also to Jean Bottéro’s work, ReligioninAncientMesopotamia,
for more general information. Livingstone asserts that presenting a full history of
1 Oppenheim 1964: 172



2
religion is challenging, yet some understanding can be gained by arranging texts and
events in chronological order.2 This is a valid assertion. A chronological arrangement
enables scholars to track changes and form an impression of the development of
Mesopotamian religion through different time periods.
While focusing on certain aspects of Assyrian culture and religion, some
reference will also be made to Babylonian and Sumerian sources. One of the
common threads throughout these cultures is how people viewed and interacted with
their gods. Mesopotamian gods were very dissimilar to the Judeo-Christian God of
modern times. They were not 'better' than humans. They had many of humanity's
traits and flaws, just on a much bigger scale. They were often arranged into familial
groups, with a spousal couple, sometimes a child and a vizier who ran their
'household'. Worshipped in purpose-built temples, they were thought to inhabit cult
statues. The temples were viewed as the gods' private houses and were run by a
priesthood who dressed and fed the deities in the form of their cult statues on a daily
basis.
The mythology is centred on the gods and their dealings with each other, and

with humanity. These myths show how people viewed their gods and give scholars a
basis for discerning the nature and character of the pantheon. Texts such as prayers,
hymns and even building inscriptions assist in that discernment. Oracles and letters
purportedly from gods enable us to see the relationship from both sides. 3 This work
is concerned with examining the goddess Ištar through her relationship with
humanity, using primarily texts written to her and oracles from her. Some
mythological texts will also be referred to. This study aims to contribute to the
understanding Ištar’s diverse nature, through examining her depiction in different
types of texts. By juxtaposing examples from a variety of genres in a previously
untried fashion, Ištar’s diversity is illustrated fully and can be acknowledged as
central to her identity.
There is no definitive, substantial publication dealing with the syncretism of
Ištar or her diverse nature. Many scholars have commented on her multifaceted
character but relatively few have attempted to explain or interpret her often
contradictory nature. Groneberg, for example, has listed Ištar’s attributes but

edited by Livingstone

neglected to conduct any substantial interpretation.4 She itemises the various areas
of Ištar’s control and comments that the lack of order or system within this list is
striking, but again seems to offer little in the way of possible explanation.5
Oppenheim’s brief examination of Ištar seems to focus on her more well-known
aspects such as her relationship with the kings.6 He does also mention in passing the
difficulties in categorising Ištar and the ‘dichotomy of her nature’, but offers no actual
explanation of these issues.7 Jacobsen deals with the goddess in slightly more detail
but as this work is, as with Oppenheim, a more introductory publication this is
perhaps unsurprising. Jacobsen remarks on the Mesopotamian’s ability to take such
contradictory characteristics and unify them in one deity.8 He ends his discussion of
Ištar by calling her ‘all woman and of infinite variety’, suggesting perhaps that her
dominion encompasses a wide range of existence rather than simply war and sexual
love.9 Harris’ article explores her as a paradox10. Ištar is viewed as a goddess who

embodied and therefore transcended polarities and contradictions and Harris asserts
that this led to the goddess defining and protecting the norms and structure of
Mesopotamian civilisation.11
The scholarship surrounding the Ištars at Arbela, Aššur and Nineveh
concentrates mainly on cataloguing and commenting on different references to the
goddess from ancient sources. Barton collected mentions of Ištar of Arbela, Nineveh
and Aššur by various Assyrian kings in his article, TheSemiticIštarCult,in 1893.12
Beckman gives a survey of the references to Ištar of Nineveh from a variety of
contexts, including Hurrian and Assyrian sources.13 Parpola’s interpretation of Ištar,
principally Ištar of Arbela, is largely based on the Assyrian prophecies collected and
translated in volume IX of the StateArchivesofAssyria.14 As well as collecting and
commenting on references to Ištar, scholars have also tried to explain and interpret
the sources. Barton makes some interpretive comments and states that the power of
Assyria was attributed to Aššur and Ištar and categorises the ‘religious concepts’ of

Ištar of Nineveh based on her epithets.15 The previous scholarship on the multiple
Ištars of Nineveh, Arbela and Aššur will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 1,
below.
Chapter One aims to provide an overview of Ištar, including a brief description
of her offices, a discussion of her different forms and her perceived relationship with
the Assyrian kings. Chapter Two discusses a text known as Agushaya, a poem which
deals with the theme of Ištar as a deity of discord and warfare. This has been
included as it is an interesting mix of a hymn of praise, an aetiology and a
mythological narrative. It also successfully illustrates Ištar‘s associations with warfare,
which was one of her primary associations. Chapter Three provides a commentary to
three of the most important hymns and prayers to Ištar. This includes discussion of
literary features where applicable and considers what these texts reveal about the
nature of Ištar and her relationship with humanity. These have been selected as they
are good example of the genre and show how Ištar’s worshippers communicated with
their goddess. Chapter Four examines a corpus of texts known as Assyrian oracles,
specifically in the light of claims by Simo Parpola as to the apparently monotheistic
15 Barton 1983: 154



7
tendencies of Assyrian religion.16 These oracles are included as they provide a
counter-point to the hymns and prayers in Chapter Three. The hymns and prayers
were humans talking to Ištar, whereas the oracles were viewed as Ištar talking to her
human worshippers. An enquiry into the writers of the oracles is made to see what
conclusions can be drawn about these individuals. All Assyrian prophecy texts
referred to in this work have been translated and edited by S. Parpola in State
Archives of Assyrian IX. These will be referenced using their museum registration
number.
This study follows the standard Assyriological methodology. Where
appropriate, the most recent textual translations available are used, in conjunction
with reviews, discussion and comments from relevant academics, as well as the
writer’s own theories. Where possible, dates for the reigns of the kings mentioned
have been provided. With the exception of Adad-Nirari and Sargon of Akkad, these
have been obtained from Cambridge Histories Online.
In conclusion, Mesopotamian religion is a challenging field of study and is
most easily viewed through the textual record. The previous study of Ištar has

touched on her diverse and contradictory nature and this study aims to further the
discussion by examining the goddess through analysis several texts from different
genres. The following chapter will provide the reader with a brief overview of the
goddess including the problem of multiple Ištars, her relationship with Assyrian kings
and how Sargon of Akkad and his daughter, Enheduanna, related to the goddess.

CHAPTER ONE
IŠTAR: AN OVERVIEW
1.1Ištar:aprofile
Ištar is one of the most written about goddesses of the Mesopotamian
pantheon, in both contemporary academic literature and in ancient times. The
amount of textual evidence that is to, about, or viewed as authored by her, surpasses
that relating to any other deity. Due to her popularity and importance in ancient times,
a substantial amount of modern scholarship also focuses on her. It is well-known that
Ištar was commonly identified in ancient Mesopotamia with the Sumerian
goddess Inanna and that her astral manifestation was as the planet Venus. Her
relationship to the West Semitic Astarte and the Southern Arabian god 'Athtar is
much less well.17
The association with the male ‘Athtar and other evidence suggests a fluidity
with regard to Ištar’s gender, referred to by Harris as her ‘well-attested psychological
and more rarely evidenced physiological androgyny’.18 Harris views this as Ištar
17 Ringgren 1973: 59; Black and Green 1992: 109
18 Harris 1991: 268, Ringgren 1973: 59



10
transcending the mortal gender boundary by exhibiting and embracing male and
female traits.19 This is shown in a variety of texts which are both explicit and implicit
with regards to Ištar’s subversion of the genders. In several texts she exhibits
traditionally male characteristics, including sexual aggression and involvement in
war.20 Ištar also identifies herself to be male occasionally and in a Sumerian
incantation text she declares ‘I am a woman, (but) verily I am an exuberant man’.21
Ištar of Nineveh was worshipped in a bearded form, despite being female otherwise
and a hymn to Ištar under the name Nanâ reads ‘I have a beard in Babylon, still I am
Nanâ’.22 It is interesting to note the different forms Ištar takes in terms of her gender.
The bearded Ištar of Nineveh was clearly viewed as a bearded female deity rather
than as being male.23 Similarly, when she declares herself to be both male and
female she exhibits qualities of both genders. Bahrani argues that rather than being a
hermaphrodite, Ištar's 'masculine' qualities are a result of her feminine characteristics

of sexuality and beauty being exhibited to destructive extremes.24 It is her beauty
rather than her masculine violence which leads men to destruction, through making
them lose their masculinity.25 This does explain some aspects of Ištar's violence,
especially that which occurs between Ištar and her male lovers, but it does not
explain why the Assyrian kings would want her at their side in battle or why Ištar is
associated with war rather than social violence. It is possibly an over complicated
explanation of the goddess’ attributes and is certainly not one which is offered in any
significant way through the primary textual sources. Ištar is very deliberately
described as an armed war goddess who physically takes part in combat, rather than
a temptress who removes men’s masculinity.26
While Ištar came to absorb various other attributes, her major aspects were as
goddess of love and war.27 She is the one goddess who gained power through being
neither mother nor consort, despite having both a husband and children in various
myths.28 Ištar and Inanna share key attributes, including associations with rain, war

and the morning and evening star.29 She was also synchretised with the Hurrian
goddess Šawuška and was also referred to as Mullissu in her capacity as the wife of
Aššur30. A number of other, lesser goddesses also came to be identified with Ištar,
possibly because of her popularity.31 As Ištar would have been widely known and it is
possible that similarities, such as her association with love and war, between Ištar
and local goddesses led to them being identified as the same entity. Bottéro states
that despite the syncretisation, Ištar remained ultimately the ‘celestial Courtesan’.32
As a goddess she became so popular and widely-known that her name entered the
language as a designation for ‘goddess’.33 Her relationship with the rest of the
pantheon is similarly complex and she is referred to as the daughter of An, Nanna as
well as Enlil in various traditions.34
Ištar's challenging nature has been commented on by several scholars. She
was a goddess of paradox, representative of order and disorder, a goddess of infinite

13
variety.35 Vanstiphout asserts that she does not have a recognisable function or
domain, in contrast with some of the pantheon.36 He uses comparisons with other
gods, such as Utu, who is responsible for justice, and Nisaba, who is associated with
scribes, literacy and education.37 He argues that whilst Ištar is linked with a variety of
things, these are presented as being personal traits, such as her argumentative
nature.38 There is some merit to this argument as Ištar seems to have been
associated with more things than some other gods, but there is more validity in the
response that her personal domains could easily be sexual love and warfare. Her
contradictory natures of goddess of love and of war have been explained as being
linked through the creation and destruction of life, as Ištar is present for both.39 This
is a simplistic connection and does not take into account the whole complexity of the
figure of Ištar. She was more than the goddess of creation and destruction and her
contradictory variety is central to her whole being. Despite her disparate traits, the

14
myths surrounding Ištar create a believable, cohesive personality.40
Ištar is portrayed as a sexually confident young woman who is used to getting
her own way.41 She is perhaps best known from the myth Ištar’s Descent to the
Underworld where she journeys to the underworld ruled by Ereshkigal. Her
subsequent imprisonment leads to the disappearance of sexual acts from the world
above and eventually Ereshkigal is tricked into releasing her by the god Ea.42 She is
the wife of Dumuzi, the shepherd and vegetation god, who takes her place upon her
escape from the underworld and whose disappearance for a portion of the year is
seen as explanation for the seasons.43
1.2TheMultipleIštars
Three major Ištar deities are referred to in several sources, each defined as
being associated with one of the three Assyrian metropolis cult centres. These were
Ištar of Arbela, Ištar Aššuritu (Ištar of Aššur) and Ištar of Nineveh. There has been
some debate in the past as to whether these were just manifestations of a single

15
goddess or were separate entities. The view of current scholarship is that they were
separate goddesses who shared a name and some characteristics. Ringgren and
Saggs both compare these different goddesses under a single name to the existence
of ‘local madonnas’ in the Roman Catholic church.44 These are not comparable
situations as the Ištars were more delineated than the local madonnas. The Ištar
figures were also seen to interact with each other in a very specific way, as can be
seen from a hymn to Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela, reportedly by Aššurbanipal
(668-635 BCE), in which the two goddesses played complementary roles in forming
Aššurbanipal as king.45
Beckman focuses specifically on Ištar of Nineveh and her Hurrian roots and
discusses some of the less important Ištar forms.46 These Ištars are local varieties
found in the Boğazköy archives and are designated by their towns of origin.47 He
concludes that they are ‘hypostases of a single divine archetype’.48 Beckman refers
to the Ištars of Arbela, Nineveh and Aššur as separate beings, with Ištar of Aššur
44 Ringgren 1973: 59; Saggs 1962: 333

16
colouring the nature of the other two.49 Why the three main Ištars are distinct
goddesses whilst the lesser Ištars are aspects of Ištar of Nineveh is not adequately
explained. Beckman describes the lesser Ištars as having both distinct and common
characteristics.50 As this is true of the three major goddesses also, Beckman’s
assertion remains unexplained.
Porter uses grammatical evidence from a hymn written for Aššurbanipal to
show that it differentiates between Ištar of Arbela and Ištar of Nineveh as separate
goddesses.51 She does make the point that whilst this shows Aššurbanipal saw the
goddesses as distinct from each other, this does not mean that it was a more widely
held belief. We know little about the religion of the ‘common’ person and are unable
to discern whether they would share the king’s beliefs, or even how much they would
adhere to the state religion. It is possible that the educated members of society such
as priests and members of court would share more in the king’s beliefs. The king was
the high priest of Assyria and for him to express a religious view at odds with the

51 In line 3, the verb ‘have’ is written in the feminine plural form and following praises use plural
pronominal suffixes (Porter 2004: 41).



17
views and beliefs of society may not have been common.52 The two goddesses are
seen as different deities, responsible for different kinds of assistance throughout
Aššurbanipal's reign. Ištar of Nineveh is responsible for placing the king on the
throne, while Ištar of Arbela provided unspecified assistance. Lambert uses the same
hymn to see the goddesses as distinct beings and references a fragmentary text from
another king who refers to Ištar of Arbela and Ištar of Nineveh as different entities.53
Prism B of Esarhaddon (680-668 BCE) also shows an understanding of the
separate natures of Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela. When listing gods who
favour him, Esarhaddon refers to ‘the Ištar of Nineveh’ and ‘the Ištar of Arbela’.54 As
a minimum of three kings referred to two different goddesses, both named as Ištar, it
can be assumed that these goddesses were viewed, by the Akkadian elite, at least,
as different goddesses rather than manifestations of a central Ištar figure.

18
1.3IštarandtheKing
Ištar and the Assyrian kings were seen to have a special relationship.55 Kings
describe themselves as being loved by Ištar and credit her for their ascension to the
throne.56 In a hymn, she is responsible for the long life of a king and the success of
his reign.57 In TheSargonBirthLegend, Sargon of Akkad (2334-2279 BCE) states
that ‘While I was a gardener, Ištar granted me (her) love, and for four and [...] years I
exercised kingship’.58 Whilst this text is agreed to be inscribed during the Old
Babylonian period, between 1700 and 1600 BCE and may not accurately reflect the
tradition within Sargon’s lifetime, they may have been copied from tablets which were
contemporary with Sargon’s rule. Even if this is not the case, they contain some small
accuracy in the case of Ištar as there are so many other sources linking the Sargon
and Ištar which were contemporary.59 Sargon is not reported as declaring ‘Ištar made
me king!’, but the statements of her love for Sargon and his elevation to kingship are
too close together to not imply cause and effect. Sargon is portrayed as justifying his

rule through divine election as he was not born into the royal family.60 He is not the
only king to have portrayed himself as being loved by Ištar, or being singled out by
her as suitable to rule. Aššurnâṣirpal II (883-859 BCE) also says that she singled him
out and desired that he rule.61 Esarhaddon lists Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela
as two deities who decided he should be king.62 Esarhaddon’s mother states in a
building inscription, contemporary with his rule and therefore an accurate example of
how the king was portrayed, that ‘[Ištar of Nineveh, Ištar of Arbela] were pleased
(and) they happily put Esarhaddon, (my) son, my offspring, on the throne of his
father’.63 In a hymn contemporary to his rule, Aššurbanipal calls himself ‘creation of
Aššur and Ištar’ and Ištar is credited with making him king.64 Prophets also portrayed
their kings as beloved of Ištar. Prophecy texts directed at the king speak of Ištar
loving or owning the king.65 As these texts were inscribed during the reign of the king
they are addressed to, they can reliably show us how the relationship between the
king and Ištar was perceived and illustrated.

Ringgren points out that whilst Sargon may have needed to legitimise his
claim to the throne, Aššurnâṣirpal II and other kings who were sons of a king did
not.66 He says that this means that divine election was more important than royal
birth.67 It is clear that divine election was important, but it is unlikely to be more
important than royal birth. Assyrian kings emphasis their birthright as well as their
divine election. Adad-nirari (1327-1274 BCE) names his father, his grandfather and
his great-grandfather in a text which lists his virtues as a king.68 Esarhaddon states
that his father named him as his heir and refers to the ‘kingship of my father’s
house’.69 Aššurbanipal refers to Esarhaddon as ‘my father, my creator’ directly after
stating how Ištar chose him as king. In the same text, written around 639 BCE,70 he
mentions Sennacherib (704-681 BCE) as ‘the father of my father’.71 As can be seen
from these examples, divine election was important for legitimising one’s claim to the
throne, but so was emphasising birthright and royal family line. Sargon’s propaganda,
even when known through later sources, may have stressed his relationship with

Ištar, but other kings with a legitimate claim to the throne spoke of their relationship
with her side-by-side with their family lines.
Jacobsen suggests that the emphasis placed by the kings on this mother-son
relationship and the sense of absolute trust the kings placed in Ištar shows an
'unflinching piety'.72 This raises an important point. It is possible that the relationship
with Ištar was manufactured to uphold the king and the monarchy. It is key, however,
to not view the Assyrian religion with too cynical an eye. Not every source which
speaks of a close relationship between the king and Ištar was propaganda. These
texts were how the people and their king connected with their gods. The Assyrian
kings believed that they had a truly special relationship with Ištar and that she had a
significant influence over their lives. It is short-sighted to dismiss ancient expressions
of belief as less valid than modern expressions.
Parpola suggests that by referring to themselves as sons of Ištar they were
laying claim to being more than just human and that they would have been viewed as
somehow semi-divine.73 This seems somewhat unlikely. A close relationship between
the king and the gods is well-attested. The king being regarded as somehow divine is

73 Parpola 1997: XL



22
less so. The king may have divine origins as he was chosen and formed by the gods
but that does not make him a divine being.74
Ištar’s maternal relationship to the kings is a recurring theme in many texts.75
In the DialogueBetweenAššurbanipalandNabû, Nabû describes Ištar of Nineveh as
having suckled Aššurbanipal when he was a child.76 This tradition can be seen in the
prophecy texts, with Ištar describing how she carries the crown prince like a nurse, as
well as suckling him and playing with him.77 Ištar also refers to Aššurbanipal as ‘my
calf, whom I (have) rear(ed)’, which is in keeping with the image of her as a wild
cow.78 The word which Parpola translates as 'calf', 'mūru', can also be translated as a
‘foal’ but still casts the king as the child of Ištar.79 Aššurbanipal states that he did not
have a human mother or father, but ‘grew up on my goddess’ knees’.80 He refers to
Ištar of Nineveh as ‘the mother who bore me’, whilst Ištar of Arbela is ‘my creator’.81
Aššurbanipal seems to want to show a connection between him and these two Ištar

deities. Aššurbanipal clearly claims support from more than a single Ištar, showing
that he at least acknowledged more than one Ištar. Crediting the Ištars with his
existence and position of king shows a close connection that the he feels exists or
wishes to give the impression of existing. Other kings also make use of this imagery.
In a prophecy addressed to Esarhaddon, Ištar refers to herself as the king’s midwife
and wet-nurse.82 This is not the same maternal imagery that has been seen in
sources relating to Aššurbanipal, but Ištar shows a similar concern for his early years.
In the same prophecy, Ištar calls Esarhaddon ‘son of Mul[lissu]'.83 This again
emphasises the personal relationship between Ištar and Esarhaddon.
It is apparent that the relationship between Ištar and the king was envisioned
as a close, loving one. It is unlikely to just be a tool to strengthen a king’s claim to the
throne. The king appears to have used it to continually connect himself with the gods.
This perpetuated the idea of the divinely-chosen and inspired ruler and it reinforced
his position as the people's representative before the gods.84
As goddess of warfare, it is natural that Ištar was also considered to assist

‘her’ king with his military endeavours. The king carries out attacks and military
activities on behalf of the gods; in a text detailing Shalmaneser III’s (858-824 BCE)
campaign to Urarțu, the king states that he is ‘campaigning for Aššur’.85 Ištar,
sometimes in conjunction with other gods, gives the king victory.86 Her role in battle is
referred to in a variety of inscriptions and texts and the link between Ištar and victory
is visible in the prophecy texts. Ištar declares that she will ‘deliver up the enemy of
the king of Assyria for slaughter’ and ‘finish off’ the king’s enemies’.87 The majority of
the prophecies contain some allusion to Ištar’s military prowess being used for the
benefit of the king, either to protect him or to attack his enemies.88 Other texts
contain similar declarations. In his hymn to the Ištars of Nineveh and Arbela,
Aššurbanipal states that the ‘strength and might’ of the goddesses conquered enemy
territories, not his own.89 This is another way in which the Assyrian kings justified
their rule and the expansion of their kingdom. If campaigns are carried out on behalf
of the gods, the military activity must be just and correct. As the head representative

of the gods, his actions must be according to their will and any successful actions will
be represented as having both the gods’ blessing and assistance.
1.4Ištar,SargonofAkkadandEnheduanna
Hallo and van Dijk attribute Sargon’s emphasis on Ištar to a campaign to
justify a reputedly illegitimate rule and consolidate his rule over a new and expanding
empire.90 It would be amiss of scholars to assume that this was the only reason for
his interest in the goddess and it is equally plausible that he felt genuine piety toward
Ištar played a part. Sargon of Akkad gained hegemony over an area that had
traditionally been made up of independent city-states.91 As part of assimilating these
territories into his rule he made his daughter, Enheduanna, the high priestess of
Nanâ at Ur.92 Sargon was only able to do this because he had power over Ur and by
doing so he showed his power over the city in an obvious and non-aggressive way.
Again, personal feelings should not be totally disregarded in explaining this act. It is
possible that pride in his daughter, or fatherly affection, led Sargon to honour
Enheduanna by giving her this position. This also meant that there was an official
90 Hallo and van Dijk 1968: 7
91 Hallo and van Dijk 1968: 7
92 Hallo and van Dijk 1968: 7



26
royal presence in the city and showed that Sargon intended to respect the city’s
religious institutions.93 Hallo and van Dijk make the point that by adapting the
‘existing cultic and dynastic institutions’ to meet his own purpose, Sargon was
consciously trying to change the casual alliance between Sumer and Akkad into an
imperial system.94 That Enheduanna is credited with writing several hymns to Ištar
under the goddess’ Sumerian name of Inanna can be no co-incidence.
Enheduanna’s hymns of praise to Ištar may have been part of his propaganda. De
Shong Meador asserts that Enheduanna’s work was a promotion of her own views,
though this seems unlikely.95 As a princess and high priestess, Enheduanna would
have had some autonomy but it is difficult to conceive that her father and king would
have left her to her own devices.96 De Shong Meador has no compunction in saying
that Enheduanna’s temple hymns and not her hymns to Ištar are likely to have been
politically motivated as they link the temples of Sumer with those of Akkad, creating
an image of cohesion and unity.97 It seems illogical to view the hymns to Ištar as

27
separate from the propaganda. It seems more likely that, as a woman who was
raised in the royal household, she followed her father’s example and formed a
special relationship with Ištar. This would mean that her literary devotions to Ištar
may have been both propaganda to assist Sargon as well as genuine hymns of
praise to her goddess. There is no reason why the texts can’t have been intended to
fulfil multiple purposes as Enheduanna would have had multiple motivations as
priestess, princess and devotee of Ištar.
Hallo and van Dijk take the connection further and suggest that Ištar came to
prominence as a result of Sargon’s rule.98 They argue that the changing status of
Mesopotamian deities was often directly linked to the popularity of their priests and
cults, so if a cult was popular with the king then the deity to which the cult belonged
would similarly rise in status.99 This is a legitimate suggestion. As the cult of a deity
became more popular and influential, it is likely that the role that deity played in the
pantheon would become more significant. It has long been understood that Marduk’s
rise to prominence in the second millennium BC was linked to the rising importance

28
of his city, Babylon.100 Sargon seems to have taken Ištar’s involvement in his life very
seriously. His assertion that he came to power due to winning Ištar's love has been
mentioned and Hallo and van Dijk take this to mean that his influence at the court of
Kiš was due to an association with a Sumerian priestess of Inanna.101 That his
mother was a priestess is asserted in TheSargonBirthLegend, and TheSumerian
KingListdescribes his father as a gardener or a date-grower, though neither of these
texts are contemporary with Sargon’s reign.102 Although these are later texts, they
may have been copied from older tablets or been based on an oral tradition from
Sargon’s reign and therefore be accurate evidence for Sargon’s propaganda. If they
were wholly the creation of scribes, they illustrate how later society envisioned
Sargon and show a lasting connection in the Assyrian culture between Ištar and the
king.
As there are two mythological stories concerning the relationship between
Ištar and a gardener, this potentially inferred that Sargon was the son of Ištar through

101 Hallo and van Dijk 1968: 6
102 TheSumerianKingList,32, trans. Jacobsen



29
one of her priestesses.103 Installing Enheduanna, a devotee of Ištar, as high priestess
would have made Sargon the son and father of different priestesses of Ištar. With
such close ties, ‘real’ or imagined for the sake of propaganda, it would be
unsurprising if Ištar’s importance increased as a result of Sargon’s reign.
1.5Conclusion
Ištar was a powerful, multi-faceted goddess who is thought to be a
syncretised divinity encompassing several deities, including the Sumerian Inanna.
Her challenging and diverse nature is the subject of scholarly debate, not least
because of she occasionally self-identifies as a male. Primarily the goddess of sexual
love and warfare, Ištar features heavily in the mythology of Mesopotamia. She was
worshipped in three main forms at Nineveh, Arbela and Aššur. Although these
goddesses share many of the same attributes, there is evidence that they were
viewed as distinct and not as different versions of the same goddess. The
relationship between these Ištar deities remains unclear, though Aššurbanipal
portrays the Ištars of Nineveh and Arbela as having complimentary roles in his
103 TheSargonBirthLegend,12, trans. Morgan; TheSumerianKingList,32, trans. Jacobsen; Hallo
and van Dijk 1968: 6



30
creation.104 Several kings of Assyria had a special connection with her, something
which may have been initiated by Sargon of Akkad with the assistance of his
daughter, Enheduanna, in the propaganda surrounding his rise to power. Ištar was
viewed variously as a maternal figure that raised the king, one of the deities
responsible for his place on the throne and the king’s military champion. The
relationship between the kings and Ištar probably had some element of tradition and
political motivation, but it is still likely that the Assyrian kings believed they were
favoured by the goddess they put their trust in.
The following chapter contains a textual analysis and discussion of the
Agushaya poem. The poem’s chief concern is with Ištar’s associations with warfare
and strife. It is analysed in three sections; praise, narrative and ending.

CHAPTER TWO
THE AGUSHAYAPOEM
2.1TextualBackground
This poem combines a hymn of praise to Ištar, an aetiology and a mythological
narrative. It bears similarities to the Mesopotamian flood story, Atrahasis,and shares
concepts with EnkiandtheWorldOrder and the Babylonian creation myth, Enuma
Eliš. There is also an element that was potentially taken from Inanna’sDescenttothe
Underworld. The narrative details how Ištar’s warlike tendencies encroach on Ea’s
dwelling, making the god angry.105 Ea reacts by creating a double of Ištar and
naming it ‘Ṣaltu’, which translates as ‘discord’.106 Ištar is furious when the two meet
and requests that he destroy Ṣaltu. Ea complies and in an attempt to appease Ištar
he establishes a ‘whirling dance’ in her honour, which Foster suggests is an aetiology
for the mock-battles that were held in honour of Ištar.107 It is possible that Ea’s
creation of the ‘whirling dance’ is a direct reference to a cultic dance or mock.
Agushaya contains themes and actions with direct parallels to other
105 Agushaya,I iv-v trans. Foster
106 Foster 1996: 96
107 Agushaya,II vii 15-16; Foster 1996: 105



32
mythological texts. Ištar’s clamour for battle and Ea’s subsequent aggravation are
similar to the opening of the EnumaEliš. The text opens with a description of Apsu,
the father of the gods, plotting to destroy his children as the noise they make stops
him from sleeping.108 The narrative of the story within Agushaya opens in the same
way, with a god attempting to stop a younger deity from encroaching into his
personal space. Ea’s position in each text also presents the reader with an
interesting role inversion. In EnumaEliš, Ea is the rowdy offspring and in Agushaya,
Ea is the aggravated father-figure who wishes to subdue a violent and clamorous
youngster.109 This similarity would have been noticed by people familiar with both
texts and they may have gained amusement from the fact that Ea uses his
predilection for trickery in his roles as both elder and younger god. This theme is
similar to one in Atrahasis, where the gods decide to destroy humanity as they are
too numerous and noisy.110 Atrahasis shows the gods’ reaction to negative aspects,
whereas Agushayashows how the gods react to another deity’s negative tendencies.
The gods are as aggravated by the intrusion of other deities as they are by
humanity's intrusion.
108 EnumaEliš,I 36-40, trans. Foster
109 EnumaEliš,I 65-70; Agushaya,I iv 19-22
110 Atrahasis,II 90, trans. Foster



33
There is also a parallel between Agushaya and EnkiandtheWorldOrder. In
Agushaya, Ṣaltu is 'strife' personified. In Enki and the World Order, Enki, the
Sumerian version of Ea, gives the gods control over certain areas of life. Enkimdu is
given farming as his domain and Kulla is named as god of the brick moulds but
Inanna/Ištar is left out.111 When Inanna complains, Enki tells her that she tangles
straight threads and destroys what should not be destroyed.112 As Ṣaltu is strife, so
Ištar is responsible for causing discord.
Another shared aspect is the use of a deity's bodily fluids. It appears to have
been an important aspect of the creation of life. In Atrahasis, man is created through
mixing clay with the flesh and blood of a slain god.113 Ea uses dirt from his fingernails
and spittle to create Ṣaltu in Agushaya and in Inanna’sDescenttotheUnderworld,
Enki creates two creatures from the dirt under his fingernails.114 There is a sense of
irony in the juxtaposition between the two narratives. In Inanna’s Descent, Enki
creates two creatures to save Inanna from ‘death’ in the underworld. Enki makes

34
them with the express purpose of saving his daughter115. In Agushaya, the creation,
Ṣaltu, is made to be used against Ištar. They are made in the same way but for
opposite purposes. In both cases, Ea/Enki gives his creations specific instructions as
to what their purpose is. The instructions Ṣaltu is given are an altered echo of the
instructions the creatures in Inanna’sDescent are given. The creatures in Inanna’s
Descent are instructed to gain the favour of Ereshkigal by sympathising with her
pain.116 In keeping with her name, Ṣaltu is to antagonise Ištar as much as she can.
Ea tells her to ‘...show no respect to her, answer her never a word to ease her
feelings’.117 This is a direct contradiction to the instructions he gives the creatures in
Inanna’s Descent. This contrast may have been picked up by the reader or the
audience. It would remind the audience of less antagonistic meetings between the
god and goddess, whilst the wider cultural knowledge of their relationship would
evoke a fuller sense of their relationship.
115 In the Sumerian tradition, Enki is Inanna’s father. She is also given An or the moon god, Nanna as
a father, depending on the local tradition.

2.2TextualAnalysis
Agushayais split into ten numbered sections, which may have been related to
the poem’s performance.118 Foster suggests that it may have been sung, dramatised
or recited in a certain way, although he gives no reason for this supposition.119 The
material may have been linked to the cult of Ištar and could provide an aetiology for a
cultic dance in honour of Ištar.120 If the poem was connected with the cult of Ištar it
may have been recited as a precursor to this dance. There are large chunks of text
missing so some of the narrative must be reconstructed. The remaining text makes
this an easy job and Foster provides a logical summary based on his translation.121
The antiphons provide a commentary outside of the narrative, which may have
served to give the audience an explanation of the character’s actions.122
The verses can be grouped into three sections based on the contents and
themes of the lines. The first section is comprised of tablet I, verse i-iii and is
dedicated to praising Ištar as a war goddess. The second section is tablet I, verse iv
II vii and is the majority of the poem. It is the main narrative and the section which

36
tells the story of the poem. It includes the institution of the ‘whirling dance’ and
information about when the poem was written.123 The final section is tablet II, verse
viii and its antiphon which gives a brief overview of the narrative and an elegant end
to the poem. Each section will be discussed below.
A full translation of this text can be found in Appendix I.
2.3SectionOne:PraiseofIštar
The tone of the poem is established within this section and it sets the scene
for Ea’s creation of Ṣaltu. The actual reason, Ištar’s encroachment on Ea’s space, is
not given until the second section but the first section describes Ištar’s personality in
such a way that her transgression is not a surprise to the audience.
2.3.1TabletI,Versei
The main aim of the scribe is clearly set out in line 1, ‘Let me praise the
greatest one, the warrior among the gods’. This is the opening line of the poem and
the desire to ‘praise the greatest one’ shows the audience that this poem is dedicated
to the praise of Ištar. The entirety of section one follows this aim. The importance of
Ištar as warrior in this poem is also made clear in line 1. It is the first of her roles to be
123 Agushaya,II vii 15-17



37
mentioned and it figures prominently in the rest of the verse and the poem as a
whole. Ištar is referred to as ‘the warrior of the gods’ twice in the first verse, leaving
the audience in no doubt as to what aspect of her the author is revering. Line 2
names her as Ningal’s daughter. This creates a link between Ištar and the rest of the
pantheon and by naming her lineage the poet gives further backing to Ištar’s power
as a goddess.124 Ištar is not named directly until line 3, which is a repetition of line 1,
again emphasising her status as a warrior. Lines 4-5 are general praise of Ištar and
line 6 refers to her aspect of warrior goddess. Both statements made in line 6 refer to
Ištar’s state of being, rather than what she is like when physically present during
warfare. By saying that ‘She is always in battle, cunning is her str[atagem]’, the
putative author is making a comment on Ištar’s interactions with others. She is not
only present in war, she also makes conflict when she is in contact with others and is
cunning in her dealings. This can be seen from the body of mythology which relates
to Ištar. In Inanna’sDescent totheUnderworld, her attempt to seize power in the
underworld unsurprisingly causes strife with her sister Ereshkigal.125 Ištar’s sole
appearance in The Epic of Gilgamesh results in an argument between Ištar and
124 Groneberg 1997: 64
125 Inanna’sDescenttotheUnderworld,115



38
Gilgamesh, started by Gilgamesh’s rejection of the goddess, and eventually the
death of his closest companion.126 She steals the mes from Enki, defeats the
mountain Ebih in battle because it will not submit to her and forces her husband to
take her place in the underworld.127 Her interactions with others, except her sexual
exploits and her apparent affection toward the king, are rarely framed in a friendly,
open way.
2.3.2TabletI,Verseii
The second verse expands the praise into Ištar's authority over other deities
and humanity. Line 1 is another reference to Ištar’s prowess in warfare. Ištar’s
actions in battle were referred to as a dance and by saying that ‘she dances around
gods and kings’ the author is saying that she is superior in battle to gods and kings,
those who may be viewed as more manly than a goddess. Her ‘manliness’ is an
indication of her skill at the male art of warfare. Foster classes lines 2-3 as the
antiphon for the previous lines and they provide a good summary.128 Ištar is hailed as
a superior goddess and the putative author has expressed his intention to praise her.

128 Foster 1996: 97



39
One might expect for an antiphon to refer to warfare, which is so crucial to this text,
but it has been so forcefully presented to the audience previously that it is possible
the scholar did not see the need to provide another reminder. Lines 4-7 contain
general praise of her power. She is not only presented as goddess of warfare, but
‘she holds...all divine authority’ and it is hers to dispense as she sees fit. She controls
the destiny of all peoples and even goddesses listen to her commands. The scholar
makes sure that the audience does not see Ištar simply as a deity of battle, but as a
powerful and wide-ranging goddess.
2.3.3Tablet1,Verseiii
Verse iii deals solely with Ištar's association with war and the scholar makes
use of the 'battle as dance' simile in an interesting and innovative way, by describing
Ištar and human warriors as opponents in a dance. The simile in line 1, ‘Young men
are hacked off as if for spear poles’, is somewhat cryptic and Foster offers the
explanation that the young men are ‘cut down to size’.129 It is unclear whether he
means literally or metaphorically cut down, but one reading is that they are ‘cut down’
in the service of Ištar in battle. He also gives alternative translation of ‘vie with each
129 Foster 1996: 98



40
other, like spears’ but appears less convinced by that suggestion.130 Lines 2-3 are
marked as an antiphon and the scholar draws the audience’s attention to remind
them of the poem’s main themes: Ištar’s superiority and her warlike tendencies.
Lines 4-6 make use of the ‘battle as dance’ analogy mentioned previously. Line 4
states that Ištar is celebrated in ‘the melee’, which, when taken with the second half
of the sentence, suggests that the celebration of Ištar is found in the physical act of
battle. Lines 5-6 are more enigmatic and Foster suggests that they may combine
words for dancing and fighting, but that it is unclear.131 Line 5 may compare dancing
partners and fighting opponents. Ištar ‘comes to grips with heroes’, meaning that she
comes up against them in battle but she takes ‘...none by the hand’. The last part of
the sentence appears to make the distinction between partners and opponents. Ištar
and the heroes are not dancing together as a combined unit; they are fighting against
each other in conflict. Line 6 continues this idea. Only the most valorous is worthy of
dancing with her rather than fighting against her. ‘Leading off’ seems to be a term
connected with dancing and if Ištar is ‘leading off with’ someone then the inference is
that she is supporting the ‘most valorous’. Lines 7-9 are an almost identical repetition
130 Foster 1996: 98
131 Foster 1996: 98



41
of lines 4-6. Repetition is a well-known feature in Akkadian literature and whilst
Cooper is sceptical of the technique’s literary merit, when used sparingly it can serve
as a useful tool for enhancing a specific idea.132 In this text, the repetition serves to
highlight the metaphor of battle as dance whilst keeping the concept of warfare at the
forefront of the audience’s mind. Repetition is also useful in performance, and it is
possible that this poem would have been performed to an audience. The final lines
make the point that Ištar was allocated this area of life. Her obsession with battle and
her talent for creating strife are not just things she is personally interested in. Ištar
was given these areas, they were shown to her ‘as [her] portion’ by Ea, the god who
objects to her encroachment.
2.4SectionTwo:TheNarrative
The middle section of the poem is the longest in length and narrates the story.
Ištar’s frenzy intrudes on Ea and he creates Ṣaltu as her counterpart. Ṣaltu is sent to
confront Ištar, who is furious about this and demands that Ea remove her, which he
does. The ‘whirling dance’ is then created and Ištar is appeased. Any potential
mythological or cultic reason behind this dispute is unknown, outside of Ištar
132 Cooper 1977: 510



42
aggravating Ea through her desire for battle.133
2.4.1TabletI,Verseiv
This verse clearly sets out the problem which Ea has with Ištar, but it also
speaks in defence of the fearsome goddess. Lines 1-6 list everything that ‘he’, either
Ea or Anu, has given to her which includes ‘uncanny frightfulness’, ‘ghastliness’ and
‘valour’.134 This male figure is attributed with giving Ištar all of these qualities.
Lines 7-8 describe how these features affected Ištar and how she ‘felt’ what
she had been given. The fact that she is the recipient of these things causes her to
scheme battle. This clear link between being given unrequested qualities and feeling
the need to act on them suggests that Ištar is not entirely to blame for frightening Ea
with her noise and fearsomeness. Groneberg notes a similarity between these lines
and a section of the mythological text InannaandEnki, in which Inanna tricks Enki
into giving her the me, which were powers possessed by the gods which ensured
that civilised life could take place.135 In both texts Inanna is described as being given
these qualities or domains of power as if they were well deserved gifts. As Enki gives
her each me he says ‘I will give them to holy Inanna’ and Inanna receives mes

134 Foster 1996: 98
135 Groneberg 1997: 66-67



43
including ‘...heroism, power, wickedness...’.136 This language is similar to that used in
lines 2 and 3; Ištar is ‘given’ ‘...bravery, fame, and might’.
Despite the suggestion that Ištar is justified in her actions, it is her that Ea
becomes angry with. Line 9 describes either Ištar's presence within or close to Ea's
dwelling. Lines 10-11 show exactly what she has done to frighten him so much. Not
only can her 'terror' be found in Ea's dwelling, she is a fearsome sight and makes a
sound to match her appearance. Ea clearly decides that something must be done
about her and lines 14-16 are remnants of Ea’s address to the gods, presumably
trying to persuade them to help him.
2.4.2 TabletI,Versev
In the lines lost between verse iv and verse v, Ea appears to have proposed
that the gods create a rival for Ištar. The verse opens by describing what the rival
should be like. Ṣaltu is Ištar’s lust for battle personified as she is to contain Ištar’s
rage and strength. Her physical similarity to Ištar is not mentioned at this stage
suggesting that it is of secondary importance. Lines 5 and 6 could seem misplaced
but Foster assures us that being hairy was a sign of strength.137 In lines 7-10 Ea lists
136 InannaandEnki,D 1-5
137 Foster 1996: 99



44
qualities that are important for a warrior to possess, including strength, endurance
and rage. Line 10 relates directly to verse iv, lines 10 and 1, in which Ištar is
compared to a bull and her noise frightens Ea. As Ištar is clamorous, so too must
Ṣaltu be aurally terrifying.
Lines 11-14 show that the gods are not powerful enough to do as Ea suggests
and tells him he must do it himself. This calls to mind a similar passage in myth in
which Nintu says that creating man is Enki’s work.138 Ea creates Ṣaltu using the dirt
from his fingernails and spittle in a method very similar to his creation in Inanna's
DescenttotheUnderworld.
Lines 20-21 are the antiphon and help to show what the missing text may have
contained. They explain that Ṣaltu is being made to ‘fight with Ištar’, which has not
been mentioned in the surviving texts and so it is likely that Ea explained his plan and
Ṣaltu's purpose in the missing lines.
The remainder of the verse describes Ṣaltu. The verse opened with a
description of how Ea wanted her to be and closes with a description of how she
actually is. This gives symmetry to the verse as a whole and also keeps reminding
the audience that Ṣaltu has been created as a rival for Ištar and is therefore very
138 Atrahasis.I 195-200; Groneberg 1997: 67



45
similar to her. Once again, Ṣaltu's physical features are almost entirely eclipsed by
her creation as a warrior. She is not described in traditionally feminine terms. Her
form is not pleasing to look at, it is discord. She is not small, dainty or attractive but
'monstrous' and her flesh and hair, two things which could be described in attractive
ways are likened to 'battle' and 'melee'. The scholar does not want the audience to
forget why Ṣaltu was created.
2.4.3TabletI,Versevi
Lines 1-6 describe Ṣaltu in terms that are also applicable to Ištar, continuing in
the same vein as the end of verse v. She is fierce, as Ištar is shown to be through her
warlike actions in verses iii and iv. Ṣaltu raises a clamour as Ištar does in verse iv
and she wears combat like clothing as Ištar wears ‘...radiance, ghastliness, valour’.139
Ea tells Ṣaltu that she is to do what he tells her and describes Ištar as being ‘strange
and cunning’.140 He gives her detailed instructions as to her purpose. These revolve
around his main aim, humiliating Ištar. He makes it clear in line 2 that all of Ṣaltu’s
power was given to her by him which parallels verse iv in which an unspecified male
figure gives Ištar a variety of attributes. This further highlights the similarities between
139 Agushaya,I iv 6
140 Agushaya,I vi 24



46
Ištar and Ṣaltu and makes it obvious that Ṣaltu is an equal match for her. Ea
encourages Ṣaltu in lines 26, 30 and 31 to be rude to Ištar by saying exactly what
she wants to, with no concern for her feelings. In line 29 he tells her that she is equal
to Ištar as she is made entirely of Ea’s power. This whole section not only serves to
give Ṣaltu confidence in her abilities but shows the audience exactly what Ea is trying
to achieve through the creation of Ṣaltu. These actions will not only humiliate Ištar,
they will also make her very angry.
2.4.4TabletI,Versesviiandviii
This verse opens with the antiphon for the previous section of text, which
again makes it clear that Ea is the source of Ṣaltu’s power:
2 While Ea, in the midst of the depths, gives her might.
The scholar is at pains to emphasise that Ṣaltu alone does not have power or
strength. She is a match for Ištar because Ea created her and because the strength
of the god is supporting her. In contrast, Ištar may have been given ‘...bravery, fame
and might’, but it is made clear that this is because she deserves them and ‘...all of
them are her due’.141 As if his previous instructions were insufficient, Ea goads Ṣaltu
to ensure she acts as he wants.
141 Agushaya,I iv 1-10



47
Ea makes certain that Ṣaltu will go confront Ištar and not ‘avoid her’, as line 10
states. By praising Ištar so volubly Ea makes Ṣaltu jealous.142 In line 15, Ea is so
obvious in his intentions that it is surprising Ṣaltu does not realise what he is doing.
Foster notes that the full meaning of line 15 is obscure, but suggests that it means
that Ṣaltu cannot succeed in her challenge to Ištar.143 Whatever the full meaning,
when placed at the end of such an extravagant passage of praise the purpose is
clearly to make Ṣaltu try and prove Ea wrong.
In verse viii Ea continues to tell Ṣaltu why she cannot possibly beat Ištar, and
Ṣaltu becomes angry. Ea has made his creation angry and eager to show that she is
capable of humiliating Ištar and therefore fulfilling her purpose. Clearly Ea has not
given Ṣaltu Ištar’s shrewdness or artfulness as his trick, which seems obvious to the
audience, apparently goes unnoticed.
2.4.5TabletII,Versei
There is a considerable amount of material lost in between tablet I and tablet
II. Foster hypothesises that in this lost text Ištar becomes aware of Ṣaltu’s unfriendly
intentions and orders her messenger to investigate her new enemy (Foster 1996:
142 Foster 1977: 80
143 Foster 1996: 102



48
96). Tablet II opens with Ištar instructing Ninshubur to find out about Ṣaltu. As in any
well-planned battle, Ištar is trying to learn as much about her opponent as she can.
By understanding Ṣaltu’s behaviour, Ištar can try to find a weakness or a way of
besting her rival. Ninshubur finds Ṣaltu and reports back to Ištar. Line 12, ‘He looked
twice when he s[a]w the exceedingly great one!’, appears to mean that Ṣaltu is so
similar to Ištar that Ninshubur at first mistakes her for the goddess and must look
twice to see that it is actually Ṣaltu. In lines 15-21 Ninshubur recounts his
observations on Ṣaltu to Ištar, being careful not to mention of her physical
appearance or the similarities between the two.144 Foster translates the speech as
being distorted due to his fear, presumably of his mistress' reaction when she finally
sees Ṣaltu.145 If this poem was to be read aloud or dramatized, then giving clues as
to how it was to be read would assist in making the story more engaging for the
audience. Ninshubur gives an accurate description of Ṣaltu's aggression and lust for
battle, again using language similar to that used to describe Ištar previously. Line 15
describes Ṣaltu as being 'bizarre', which is similar to Ea's description of Ištar as
'strange and cunning' in tablet I, verse vi. In line 18, Ṣaltu cries for battle and in tablet
144 Foster 1996: 96
145 Foster 1996: 103



49
I, verse iv Ištar schemes for battle in her heart.
2.4.6TabletII,Verseii
Ištar's response to Ninshubur's description of Ṣaltu is, unsurprisingly, a
parallel to Ṣaltu's response to Ea's description of Ištar. She becomes angry at this
threat to her supremacy and prepares herself to confront Ṣaltu. Lines 3 and 4 are a
slightly altered repetition of lines 1 and 2. The remainder of the verse continues to
describe Ištar's response. By telling the audience that Ištar 'grinds up her enemies'
in line 5, the scholar removes any doubt from the audience's mind as to which entity
will triumph in their confrontation. The declaration of her often victorious state gives
no hint that Ištar might fail and reminds the audience that Ištar is never bested in
battle. Ṣaltu may be created in the image of Ištar, but that does not mean she is a
threat to her. Lines 6-7 once again refer to her aggressive tendencies. She 'turns not
back', she does not retreat in battle and 'like a young man' she is brave and skilled in
battle. Ištar is derisive in her assessment of Ṣaltu's might in line 9, giving some
amusement to the audience because as Ištar's double, Ṣaltu presumably has the
same signs of might as Ištar. While the opening of the entire poem declares that its
purpose is to praise Ištar, lines like this very slyly make light of how seriously Ištar



50
seems to take herself and her own abilities. It is not an outright criticism of Ištar, but it
does suggest that she is not as spectacular as she thinks she is.
2.4.7TabletII,Versevi
There is a large amount of text missing between verses ii and what Foster
chooses to label as verse vi. There is little evidence of what events this text covered
but verse vi opens with Ištar asking Ea why he created Ṣaltu, and in verse vii Ištar
asks Ea to return Ṣaltu to where she came from. In the missing lines it must have
become apparent to Ištar exactly who is responsible for Ṣaltu. Lines 4 and 7 show
that Ištar's aggravation stems from two problems. The first is that Ṣaltu was created
specifically to be set against Ištar. The second is that by creating Ṣaltu, Ea has
transgressed on Ištar's uniqueness. Line 7 is one of the issues Ištar has with Ṣaltu's
creation and is rooted in the idea that there cannot be more than one Ištar. She is
unique within the pantheon as a goddess whose identity comes from being neither
wife nor mother, despite having both a husband and children. Her power instead
stems from her individuality. If another goddess felt free to act as Ištar did then she
would lose all potency. The existence of Ṣaltu as another goddess who can
challenge Ištar’s individuality challenges the goddess' identity and place within the



51
pantheon. The multiple Ištars do not seem to present the same threat to one another.
2.4.8TabletII,Versevii
This verse contains Ištar's request to have Ṣaltu removed and Ea's response,
including the instigation of the 'whirling dance' to celebrate Ištar. Ištar requests that
Ea does something about Ṣaltu, as he was responsible for creating her and Ea gives
a reply that requires some interpretation. Line 5 tells Ištar that is was her own fault
that Ea created Ṣaltu, but the second part of the line appears to mean that she has
caused Ea delight in being finished with her previous attitude. Line 4 is interpreted by
Foster as Ea saying that Ṣaltu will disappear, or has disappeared because Ištar
changed her attitude.146 It is possible that by asking Ea instead of threatening him,
Ištar has shown enough of a change in attitude to justify Ṣaltu's disappearance. As
soon as Ištar asked for Ṣaltu to leave, she disappeared. As the embodiment of Ištar’s
aggression, Ṣaltu is reabsorbed into the goddess’ character once Ištar has
demonstrated self-control and restraint enough to control her own discord.
The rest of the verse is the establishment of the whirling dance and a few lines
referring to when the poem was written. In line 6, Ea appears to backtrack slightly
and say that Ṣaltu was created so that people would know about Ea and Ištar, after
146 Foster 1996: 96



52
having said that he was forced to create her to try and contend with the goddess.
Foster says that Ea created Ṣaltu to show Ištar what she looks like.147 This does not
match up with what Ea is telling Ištar. An alternative interpretation is that Ea is
attempting to make it seem as though Ṣaltu had a dual purpose; to help Ea get Ištar
to quieten down and to give future people help in remembering the gods through this
dance. Ea is attempting to calm Ištar down by telling giving her a yearly festival. He
points out what great numbers of people are dancing to her honour in a further
attempt at mollification. Ištar is silent for the remainder of the poem, and so must be
assumed was suitably flattered through the creation of the festival.
2.5TheEnding
In the final verse the scholar's voice resumes its commentary and an antiphon
is provided to end his praise. The poem closes as it opened, with a declaration of
Ištar's praise and lines referring to her might and glory. A brief overview of the
narrative is given and the scholar reminds the audience of Ṣaltu's might. The scholar
seems to leave it ambiguous as to whether he is referring to himself or Ea on several
147 Foster 1996: 96



53
occasions, leaving the audience to guess who is speaking this last section.148 The
last two lines of the poem are an antiphon which calls into question whether the 'her'
mentioned in lines 7 and 8 is Ṣaltu or Ištar. At first glance, line 7 seems to be
grouped with the text referring to line 3, in which case it is Ṣaltu who is being talked
about. Line 8 could potentially follow on from this section of text, which would mean
that only the final line refers to Ištar. This is complicated by the fact that both lines
could be seen to be talking about Ištar also. Given the ambiguity, and the similarities
between Ištar and Ṣaltu that have been pointed out consistently though the entire
text it would make more sense for these to be talking about them both. Ṣaltu is a
personification of Ištar's battle lust and therefore could be seen as an aspect of the
goddess who has been given a form. By leaving these lines ambiguous, the scholar
can praise both figures at the same time and yet be praising Ištar overall. If that is the
case, then Ea/the scholar has made all the people aware of the might of Ištar and
the might of her battle aspect in Ṣaltu, they have glorified both and given both fame
that they are worthy of.
148 Foster 1996: 105



54
2.6Conclusion
The Agushaya poem bears several similarities to other Mesopotamian myths,
including the opening of EnumaEliš; a main theme of Atrahasis; Ištar as strife from
EnkiandtheWorldOrderand the creation of creatures from clay in Inanna’sDescent
totheUnderworld. The text opens with a section of praise to Ištar, which makes it
clear that this is a poem about Ištar as a war goddess and instigator of conflict. The
narrative section of the poem tells the story of the creation of Ṣaltu, the reasons for
her creation and Ištar’s reaction to her, Ṣaltu is a parallel to Ištar and the goddess
sees Ṣaltu as a threat to her supremacy, potentially because Ištar’s power is derived
from being unique within the pantheon and Ṣaltu’s presence means that Ištar is no
longer unique. The narrative section of Agusyhaya ends with a possibly aetiological
explanation for a dance in praise of Ištar. The poem ends with praise that
ambiguously could refer to Ištar, Ṣaltu, or both.
The following chapter contains an analysis and interpretation of three major
hymns and prayers to Ištar. ASyncretisticHymntoIštaris both a hymn of praise and
a list of god’s names, which syncretises Ištar with other deities. TheGreatPrayerto
Ištar is a more traditional prayer which requests assistance from the goddess and



55
appears to focus on Ištar as a judge and ruler. Aššurbanipal’sHymntotheIštarsof
Nineveh and Arbela is a hymn in which the two Ištar are discussed as separate
beings and are credited with the creation of Aššurbanipal as king.



56
CHAPTER THREE
ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE
MAJOR HYMNS AND PRAYERS TO IŠTAR
3.1 ASyncretisticHymntoIštar
3.1.1TextualIntroduction
ASyncretisticHymntoIštar, translated by Lambert (2003), appears to be a
scholar’s attempt to bring coherence to the Mesopotamian pantheon. Written around
363 BCE, it lists names and attributes of Ištar in the form of a hymn of praise, whilst
simultaneously associating her with other deities in a syncretistic effort. Lambert
observes that the text appears to be both a hymn of praise and a list of god's
names.149 The structure of the hymn shows this to be a valid observation. The tone of
the hymn is reverent; Ištar is 'honourable, the most proud of goddesses' and 'the
queen of the totality of everything'.150 Her attributes are listed alongside the names of
other goddesses, as well as one god, whom the scribe amalgamates with Ištar.
Generally speaking, each line opens with either the name of a goddess, an
149 Lambert 2003: 26
150 ASyncretisticHymntoIštar,10, 20



57
epithet of Ištar, or a description of or reference to one of her attributes. Sometimes a
specific Ištar, such as Ištar of Akkad, is referred to and the Ištar is non-specific.
Eighteen lines in the prayer do not open with a reference to any specific goddess. It
is assumed that the reader can infer what goddess the scribe is discussing by how
she is described and by the fact that Ištar is referred to on a number of other
occasions. Lines 16 and 17 both syncretise Guše'a with Ištar, but Ištar is not
mentioned by name. It is clear from the description that it refers to Ištar. Both lines
give a description of a goddess and then the name 'Guše’a'.
16 the heroine who does not retreat in the conflict of unsheathed
weapons - Guše’a.
17 at whose battle cries the wall of the mountain buckles for her, and the
mountain stone melts for her – Guše’a.
The epithets used to describe the goddess clearly refer to Ištar. It is therefore
irrelevant that she is not mentioned by name as her identity can be discerned through
the description, as well as through the explicit references in the rest of the text.



58
3.1.2TextualComposition
Whilst lines 16-17 seem to be linked in their composition, Lambert suggests
that lines 15-16 were composed as a couplet as both relate to actual fighting.151 An
alternative theory is that lines 13-17 were composed as a verse, comprising of two
couplet pairs in lines 13-4, and 16-17 and a 'bridge' line, line 15.
13 Goddess of bow, arrow and quiver, who dances in battle like a
tornado - Ištar of Akkad,
14 Inninna, a strong shield, who stands erect when confronted with the
battle-line - Ištar of Akkad.
15 Lofty arms, at the shooting of whose savage arrow the mountains are
not covered – Šimaliya,
16 The heroine who does not retreat in the conflict of unsheathed
weapons - Guše’a,
17 At whose battle cries the wall of the mountain buckles for her, and
the mountain stone melts for her – Guše’a,
The lines in this verse refer to more tangible aspects of warfare, which can be
related back to the mortal experience of combat. The couplet of lines 13-14 mention
physical tools used in warfare, as does line 15. Lines 16 and 17 refer to actions taken
during a battle, namely the unsheathing of weapons and warriors giving battle cries.
151 Lambert 2003: 27



59
These mortal experiences are made grander and more divine in order to be suited to
Ištar. Ištar does not merely carry a shield in line 14, she is a shield. Her battle cries
do not just frighten the enemy, the very mountains quake at her shout.152 The first
couplet of this verse is imitated by the second. Both couplets open with a reference
to offensive aspects of warfare. In line 13, Ištar is the goddess who dances in battle
and in line 16 she is the heroine who does not retreat in battle, the inference being
that she advances towards her enemies. Each couplet also has a goddess that is
syncretised with Ištar, Ištar of Akkad or Guše’a. Line 14 is an anomaly within the
verse as it is the only one which names a goddess at the beginning of the line.
This verse structure also occurs earlier in the text. Lines 4-8 have a similar
format, with two sets of couplets and a bridging line. The theme of this verse is Ištar's
astral aspect, which can be seen from the language used.
4 Ištar, who is covered with radiance, enveloped with awe as with a
storm – Ninlil of Hursagkalamma,
5 Inninna, torch which flares up for all habitations from the distant
heaven -Dilbat,
6 Heroic goddess, who gives off bright flames on the royal dais of Anu
152 ASyncretisticHymn,17



60
– Ištar of Uruk,
7 Prostitute who exercises control right and left, and bars the land like
a bolt the Wagon star,
8 Ninsik[il]la, whose net surrounds the sphere of the people wherever
the wind blows – the Wagon star,
Line 4 is problematic in this interpretation as it contains no explicit
acknowledgement of Ištar as a star. The 'radiance' that Ištar is covered with and the
awe that envelops her suggests the divine glow that was thought to emanate from
deities.153 This glow is reminiscent of the light emitted by stars and links it with lines
5-8. Line 5 conveys the same sense as line 4 with a reference to Ištar as a torch in
the heavens, clearly depicting her as a star. This is emphasised by the introduction of
the name 'Dilbat', another name for the Ištar star, at the end of the line.154 The astral
association can be seen clearly in the second couplet, where Ištar is referred to as
'the Wagon star'. Reiner asserts that in the celestial omen texts at least the Wagon
Star was associated with the Ištar star.155 It has also been suggested that Ištar's
association with prostitution was linked somehow to her astral aspect, as prostitutes
153 ASyncretisticHymn4; Rochberg 2009: 49
154 ASyncretisticHymn5; Lambert 2003: 27; Langdon 1914: 179
155 Reiner 1995: 3; Reiner 1985: 594; The Wagon Star is known by the modern name of ‘Ursa Major’.



61
and the Ištar star were both visible in the evenings.156 It is hard to gauge the
accuracy of this statement as Jacobsen offers no explanation as to how we know the
working hours of Mesopotamian prostitutes. If this was an accurate suggestion, it
would further link the description of Ištar as a prostitute with the later designation of
her as 'the Wagon Star' in line 7. The Sumerian name for the god Anu, 'An', literally
translates as 'sky', so 'the royal dais of Anu' in line six is probably a reference to
heaven or the sky.157 This would make the goddess 'who gives off bright flames' Ištar
in her astral form. Line 8 syncretises the goddess Ninsikilla with Ištar through
association with the Wagon star, pairing it with line 7.
3.1.3AspectsofIštar
A systematic consideration of Ištar's attributes and epithets within this hymn
reveals elements that the original scholar considered to be most important.
Unsurprisingly, her association with war and battle is one of the most popular
associations and appears in eight of the thirty-nine lines.158 Ištar of Akkad is
associated with Ištar's warlike attributes four out of the five times she is mentioned
156 Jacobsen 1976: 141
157 Reiner 1995: 5
158 ASyncretisticHymn,11, 13-17, 25, 30



62
and is clearly closely related with the aspect of Ištar as goddess of war.159 It is
interesting to note that three of these lines focus on the more aggressive side of
Ištar.160 Clearly, Ištar of Akkad was associated more with Ištar's capacity as an
aggressor than a defender. The imagery employed by the scribe in relation to Ištar of
Akkad is also intriguing. Instead of the more usual image of Ištar as a lion, in two
instances the scribe describes her as being a viper and as making the land submit as
if it were a snake.161 By describing Ištar as a 'viper crammed with poison' the scribe
evokes a very different idea of her to the more common image of Ištar as a lion in
battle. Both references to Guše’a are also related to Ištar's warlike attributes. Line 17,
which refers to Ištar's battle cry, is potentially alluding to the myth of Ištar's battle with
Mt. Ebih, in which she defeated the mountain and sliced a portion off the summit.162
Ištar's involvement in control and justice is attested also in eight lines, making
it of as much concern to the scribe as her involvement with battle.163 Lines 1-3 open
the hymn with references that suggest Ištar is viewed as having supremacy over the
other gods, making it clear that this is in part a hymn of praise. Ištar's 'decision is not
159 ASyncretisticHymn,11, 13-14, 25
160 ASyncretisticHymn,11, 13, 25
161 ASyncretisticHymn,11, 25
162 InannaandEbih,131-151
163 ASyncretisticHymn,1-3, 7-8, 20-21, 35



63
rejected', she 'controls all the decrees' and 'is established by the totality of the
ordinances'.164 The scribe wishes to make the point that Ištar's position among the
gods was established by the divine ordinances, the me and that this sets her in a
position apart from the rest of the pantheon.165 The me included things such as
carpentry, wisdom and control over fire.166 The fact that she alone controls all of the
decrees and that whatever decisions she makes, presumably with regards to the
decrees she controls, are not rejected by the other gods implies her superiority.167
This theme is continued in line 7 where Ištar is referred to as exercising 'control right
and left', repeating the idea that she has supreme authority. Line 8 is less
straightforward but does still refer to the control Ištar possesses. The 'sphere of the
people' is possibly meant to encompass everything within the mortal realm, linking it
to the meand showing that Ištar has influence on or control over everything in human
society.168 Line 20 gives the most unequivocal declaration of her control over the
world as it states that she is 'queen of the totality of everything, mistress of all
judgements'. That this line then goes on to syncretise her with Ereshkigal, Ištar's

165 ASyncretisticHymn,2
166 InannaandEnki,D, 10, 14, 16
167 ASyncretisticHymn, 1, 3
168 ASyncretisticHymn, 8



64
sister and queen of the underworld, is very deliberate and shows Ištar as ruling the
underworld.169 Line 21 calls Ištar 'the noose of heaven and netherworld', again
implying that she has control not only over the underworld but the heavens as well. It
also refers to Ištar as 'mistress of the Igigi', a collective term for the gods of heaven
showing that the scholar is portraying her as having some control over other gods.170
Line 35 further enforces the idea presented in lines 1-3 that Ištar is supreme above
the other gods. Not only are her decisions upheld, but no god will transgress her
rules.171 Within this hymn, Ištar is systematically associated with and given power
over four main areas: the universe, the heavens, earth and the underworld, as well
as over humans and gods. Lines 4-8, which relate to Ištar's astral aspect, imply that
she has control over the heavens. Lines 20 and 21 give her dominion of the
underworld and line 8 appears to deal specifically with control over the earth and
human society. Lines 1, 3 and 35 do not necessarily give her control over the other
gods but they do show that she is superior to them and line 21 implies actual control.
Ištar is described in line 3 as being both Enlil and Ninlil. Given that Enlil and
Ninlil were a married pair this is somewhat unusual and even more unusual is Ištar's

direct syncretisation with a male deity, Enlil. The association with Ninlil can be
understood as helping to promote Ištar by amalgamating her with as many
goddesses as possible. This too can explain why such a wide variety of female
deities are shown within the hymn as the same as Ištar.172 The syncretism with Enlil
is problematic. Ištar is sometimes described as being bearded but this can be
explained as by the fact that the Ištar star has a beard and may be an astronomical
reference.173 To be directly connected with a male deity is clearly more of an allusion
to Ištar's masculine aspects than any astral association. As has been previously
discussed, Ištar embodied two traditionally male aspects, war and sexual love. Due
to some of her masculine personality traits it is unsurprising that she should
sometimes be viewed as having masculine physical features also. At the same time,
the beard could also have been an outward declaration of authority. As the Ancient
Near East was a society where men held the greatest authority, a masculine
appearance could have denoted that same masculine authority. As stated previously,
possessing an abundance of hair was a sign of strength and the importance of facial
hair as a sign of masculinity can be seen in the Assyrian palace reliefs from Nineveh

in which male figures have elaborate beards.174 By referring to Ištar as being
bearded, the scholars could be borrowing one of the outward signs of male authority
to give Ištar that same power. This is also excellent evidence for the view of Ištar as
somehow crossing the gender boundary and being viewed as both male and female
at the same time. By stating that ‘she is Enlil, she is Ninlil’, a married pair, the scholar
could be stating that masculinity and femininity are combined within Ištar’s entity.
This is a reference to Ištar’s unique, gender-crossing character and should not be
read as an attempt by Assyrian scholars to form a monotheistic practise out of a
religion that was polytheistic to its core. As a single being, Ištar is both male and
female.

3.2TheGreatPrayertoIštar
3.2.1TextualIntroduction
The Great Prayer to Ištar is known from three texts and is thought to have
been originally composed sometime around the middle of the second millennium
BCE.175 These are STC II, a text which is written in Late-Babylonian script, KUB
XXXVII 36, 37, a Babylonian text from Boğazköy, and KUB XXXI 142, which is in
Hittite. Güterbock and Reiner transliterated and translated all three texts in TheGreat
PrayertoIštarandItsTwoVersionsfromBoğazköy, although the present study is
restricted to the Neo-Babylonian and Akkadian translations.176 In contrast to A
Syncretistic Prayer to Ištar this appears to be a prayer requesting assistance and
follows a more traditional format. It opens with the Sumerogram 'ÉN', indicating that
this is an incantation text. The first line, 'I implore you, Lady of ladies, goddess of
goddesses' makes it clear that whomever is reciting this text is requesting help of
some kind.177 The bulk of the following text praises Ištar and seems to focus greatly
on her capacity as ruler and maker of decisions. The section of text from lines

68
27/24178 to 30/27 requests Ištar's mercy and addresses her different attributes. Then
follows more praise and lines 40/6' to the end once again requests the return of her
favour to the supplicant.
3.2.2TheOtherNamesofIštar
There are three lines in which the names of other goddesses are invoked in
the place of Ištar. The first instance is in line 3/7 where the goddess is referred to as
Irnini in STC II and Inanna in KUB XXXVII 36+37. Ištar's identification with Inanna is
well-documented and needs no further discussion here.179 Her association with Irnini
is somewhat less common and Jacobsen suggests that Ištar as Irnini is the
personification of victory.180 As this name is used in a line which declares Ištar's
superiority over the Igigi, this association would not be out of place. If Ištar is superior
over the Igigi, then it could be said that she is victorious in her superiority and using a
name which refers to victory invokes that implication. The name Guše’a is also used
instead of Ištar.181 It is parallel to the references to Guše’a in TheSyncretisticPrayer
178 When referring to TheGreatPrayerofIštar, the first line number will relate to text STC II and the
second will relate to KUB XXXVII 36+37, eg line 3/7 means line 3 in STC II and line 7 in KUB
XXXVII 36+37. Numbers follow Güterbock and Reiner's translation (1967).

69
as the name is used in conjunction with Ištar's aspect as goddess of war. The line
suggests an aggressive rather than defensive characteristic, describing her as being
'draped in battle, clothed in chilling fear'. It is worth remarking that this line uses
traditionally feminine features of clothing and appearance to highlight distinctly
masculine traits. The third name used in the place of Ištar is Irninitu and is used in
TheGreatPrayer when the supplicant wishes for her heart to be appeased.182 This
name is used in conjunction with a reference to her heart as 'a raging lion'. This is an
unsurprising comparison as Ištar was often referred to as, and associated with,
lions.183
3.2.3Ištar'sJustice
This prayer stresses Ištar's capacity as judge and ruler. Seven of the lines
refer to Ištar being responsible for just decisions or for making rules.184 When read in
conjunction with the sections that request mercy from Ištar, it can be seen that the
supplicant is emphasising these attributes to persuade her to take pity on him and
end whatever difficulties he is having. It is parallel to reminding someone of how
generous they are in order to benefit from said generosity. By reminding Ištar that
182 TheGreatPrayer,15/8'

184 TheGreatPrayer,7/11b, 13/15b, 25, 26, 38/4', 39/5', 41/7'



70
she has control over judgement and underlining her apparent tendency towards
mercy, the petitioner is trying to encourage her to exercise these qualities in his
favour. These reminders of mercy and judgement are spaced between general praise
to Ištar and praise focused on her position of ruler over men or the gods. As in A
Syncretistic Hymn, it is made clear that Ištar has a position of superiority. She is
referred to as 'Queen of all habitations', and 'the gods shake and the Anunnaku
tremble' at the mention of her name.185 The prayer states that the highest three gods,
Anu, Enlil and Ea placed her above the other gods, though presumably they did not
place her above themselves.186 The themes of Ištar's superiority, judgement and
mercy are closely intertwined within this prayer. It is likely that this was a deliberate
attempt by the scribe to not only 'persuade' Ištar to grant the supplicant's request, but
to prove that she has the authority to do so. Line 18/19 shows a kind of pedigree for
her position of superiority. The three great gods, Anu, Enlil and Ea gave her this
power and so it cannot be questioned by anyone. By emphasising her position of
power over men and the other gods the prayer makes it clear that if Ištar wishes to
have mercy, nothing can prevent her from doing so. This opens the way for her to do
185 TheGreatPrayer,2/6, 21/21
186 TheGreatPrayer,18/19



71
as requested.
As has been previously stated, the prayer contains sections of praise as well
as requests for mercy. The first section of requests comes directly after lines extolling
Ištar as a deity involved with justice and judgement. The lines preceding the requests
read:
25 You give decisions for all mankind in justice and equity,
26 You look with favour upon the mistreated and the oppressed (and)
daily give them true judgement.
This is an excellent example of the phenomenon discussed earlier whereby
Ištar is apparently reminded of her power. This reminder seems to be intended to
persuade Ištar to assist the supplicant. The language emphasises the rarely attested
merciful aspect of Ištar’s nature which reinforces the request.
27/24 Have mercy, Lady of heaven and earth, who shepherds mankind,
28/25 Have mercy, Lady of Holy Eanna, the pure treasury,
29/26 Have mercy, My Lady! Your feet do not tire, your legs are quick to
run,
30/27 Have mercy, Lady of battle and of all close fight.
The repetition of the words 'have mercy' serve to highlight the request. The
epithets which follow relate to Ištar's status as ruler of both heaven and earth, her



72
main temple and her status as the war goddess. At first glance it is surprising that her
other main concern, that of sexual love, is not mentioned as it is a powerful and more
obvious aspect than her placement within the pantheon. Being queen of heaven and
earth and goddess of war may have carried more authority than being goddess of
love and so the supplicant is appealing to the most powerful aspects of her that he
can. Line 28/25 helps to remind Ištar about her obligations to humanity and
specifically to the speaker of the prayer. By mentioning the Eanna temple, the
speaker brings to mind the sacrifices and worship Ištar receives from humans and is
prompted to 'have mercy', either out of a sense of obligation or out of a desire to
ensure the sacrifices and worship continue.
The last section of the prayer is another plea for mercy and for Ištar to
intercede on behalf of the supplicant. As with lines 27/24 to 30/27, the lines leading
up to this request are intended to persuade Ištar to help.
39/5' Goddess of men, Ištar of women, whose counsel no one can find out,
40/6' Wherever you look with favour, the dying gets well, the sick gets up,
41/7' The unjustly treated becomes prosperous, when he can behold you.
Line 39/5' makes it clear that Ištar's importance is equal to both men and
women; she is a goddess to both genders. The use of her name as a determinative



73
for 'goddess' has been discussed before but it is interesting that this line includes
both 'Ištar' and 'ilat', side by side. This could be for literary reasons. It is, after all,
more interesting to use a variety of words when referring to a single entity than to use
the same word repeatedly. Lines 40/6' and 41/7' return to the theme of Ištar’s mercy
and beneficial acts towards mankind. The return of this theme, which is present from
line 40/7' up until the close of the prayer, keeps the supplicant's request for help at
the forefront of the text. The fact that the prayer closes with a section comprised
mainly of requests rather than praise makes it clear that this text serves a purpose
other than the glorification of Ištar.
The final section of the Neo-Babylonian version and the penultimate section of
the text from Boğazköy contain the only mention of why the supplicant is suffering. In
traditional Mesopotamian style, it is assumed that the suffering man is having
difficulties because he has inadvertently offended or upset Ištar.
51/8' O Irninitu, may your heart, a raging lion, be appeased,
52/8'b May your mood, an angered wild bull, relent.
53/9'b May your propitious eyes be upon me,
11' [may my angry god and goddess be reconciled] with me, my prayer(?)
[...]



74
59/12' Until then, My Lady, will fools and weaklings overtake me?
Lines 51/8' and 52/8'b shows that the supplicant feels that he has angered
Ištar and she is the cause of his misfortune. If he successfully appeases her then he
will be successful again. The last line of the section, 59/12' could hint at what
hardships he has suffered. If this is a personal reference rather than a stock phrase it
could be that he was being surpassed in either business or his personal life by
individuals he regarded as 'fools and weaklings'.
3.3Aššurbanipal’sHymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela
3.3.1TextualComposition
This hymn is written as if it was a composition of the Assyrian king,
Aššurbanipal. It gives praise to Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbela. In the text it is
quite clear that the two goddesses are intended to be viewed as distinct beings,
rather than a manifestation of the same deity.187 They are named separately in the
first two lines of the hymn, alongside an instruction to 'exalt and glorify' Ištar of
Nineveh and 'magnify and praise' Ištar of Arbela.188 The author could have easily
187 Porter 2004: 41
188 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela,1-2, trans. Livingstone



75
written 'magnify and praise the Lady of Nineveh and Arbela' if they were intended to
be viewed as a single goddess, but the two are deliberately named in a manner
which delineates one from the other. This is not the goddess of Nineveh and Arbela
which is being referred to, it is the goddess of Nineveh and the goddess of Arbela.
This distinction continues throughout the hymn. The goddesses are frequently
referred to as 'they' and verbs are used in the feminine plural forms.189 Again, this
shows that two beings are being discussed rather than two aspects of one goddess.
3.3.2TextualAnalysis
This hymn differs from the previous texts as it is not dominated by praise or
supplication. Instead, it contains limited direct praise and a description of the
goddesses' great works through the medium of Aššurbanipal's reign. It opens with a
somewhat traditional declaration of the goddesses' superiority over the other gods.190
This makes one of the purposes of the hymn clear, to glorify Ištar of Nineveh and
Ištar of Arbela. The prayer continues by referring to their cult centres, which then
leads neatly to what is apparently a reference to the prophecies and oracles that
189 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 4, 6, 16, 18
190 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 3



76
issued from the cult centres of Ištar.191 Lines 6 and 7 read 'A word from their lips is
blazing fire! Their utterances are valid for-ever!'192 A substantial body of oracular
texts were written in the cult centres of Ištar, typically in her temple at Arbela.193
These were thought to be literally the words of Ištar which she delivered through the
prophet or prophetess for the benefit of the king. By talking about the 'word' of the
Ištars that are 'valid for ever', the text is referring to the words Ištar uttered in oracles.
As king, Aššurbanipal received oracles addressed directly to him from Ištar and
would have seen them as instructions or advice on his rule. As words of a goddess,
naturally they would be 'valid for ever'. This is not only a reflection of the way in which
the Assyrian royal family interacted with the cult of Ištar, it is an example of an almost
invincible security measure for the king. If he acted in a way that was based on the
'word of Ištar', he could not only be sure that he was doing what his goddess desired,
he could use it to mitigate against any discontent from the people in relation to his
actions. Unsuccessful action could be blamed on an unclear oracle, rather than the
incompetence of the king.
Following the opening lines is a section which introduces the speaker as
191 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 5-7
192 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela,6-7
193 K 4310, ii 9, 40, v 24, vi 31



77
Aššurbanipal and sets the tone for the rest of the hymn.194 The following lines of the
hymn stress the relationship between the goddesses and the king, which is
foreshadowed in lines 8-12. Aššurbanipal refers to himself as 'offspring of Nineveh'
and 'product of Emashmash and Egashankalamma'.195 The link created by calling
himself the son of Nineveh is somewhat self-explanatory and lines 9 and 10
emphasise this link as Emashmash and Egashankalamma refer to the temples of
Ištar in Nineveh and Arbela.196 By calling himself a product of those temples,
Aššurbanipal links himself to both the goddesses and their cult of worship in Assyria.
The remainder of the hymn is focused mainly on reinforcing Aššurbanipal's
connection with the goddesses in a way which is primarily concerned with his
position as king, as well as his reign. The hymn generally follows the chronology of
Aššurbanipal's life, though the line concerning his birth occurs at the very end of the
hymn in line 14.197 This chronology begins with line 13.

13 - 15 I knew no father or mother, I grew up in the lap of my goddesses.
As a child the great gods guided me, going with me on their right
and the left.
16-17 They established at my side a good genie and a good angel,
assigned my life to guardians of well-being and health.
The section deals with the king's early life. The statement that he 'knew no
father or mother' is figurative. As the familial line was crucial in the Assyrian dynastic
tradition, it is highly unlikely that Aššurbanipal did not know who his parents were.
Instead, this statement is intended to reinforce the closeness of the relationship
between the Ištars and the king. Lines 15-17 make it clear that Ištar of Nineveh and
Ištar of Arbela are not the only deities who wish for Aššurbanipal to succeed as a
king. 'The great gods' seems to refer to the Mesopotamian pantheon and clearly
implies that all of the gods guided Aššurbanipal in his early life.198 Lines 16 and 17
appear to still relate to Aššurbanipal's childhood. As a child, the king would have
needed divine assistance in terms of health and protection, if for no other reason
than because of high child mortality rates. In order to give their favoured prince the
best chance of becoming king, it makes sense for the goddesses to give
198 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 15



79
Aššurbanipal a genie, an angel and guardians of well-being and health.199 The
presence of this divine assistance again refers to Aššurbanipal's claim that he was
favoured by the goddesses.
The second section appears to refer to Aššurbanipal's life and rule. Lines 18
and 19 talk about how the goddesses set Aššurbanipal above all other kings by
glorifying his stature, fortifying his strength and spreading his fame 'over all rulers'.200
The fact that these lines mention strength and other rulers makes it clear that the
hymn is no longer referring to Aššurbanipal's childhood. He is being discussed in
comparison to other rulers rather than princes and strength in battle was a key
attribute of Assyrian kings. The lines which follow have a military orientation that is
unsurprising in a hymn to the Ištars of Nineveh and Arbela.
20-22 [All enem]ies heard (of me), [all] the recalcitrant lands, which did
not submit to the kings, my fathers, and did not bring [tribute and]
gifts before them, trembled with fear.
23 [I am] Aššurbanipal , the creation of the hands of the great gods.

3 [...] their words.
4-6 Not [with] my [own strength], not with the strength of my bow, but
with the power [... and] strength of my goddesses, I made the
lands disobedient to me submit to the yoke of Aššur.
This section opens with a statement of Aššurbanipal's power as king. His
declaration that lands which did not submit to his forefathers trembled in front of him
portrays Aššurbanipal as a king superior to his predecessors.201 Despite seeming like
a statement of Aššurbanipal's own superiority, it is actually used to praise the Ištars.
Lines 23-6 attribute Aššurbanipal’s position directly to the gods and the Ištars of
Nineveh and Arbela. In line 23, Aššurbanipal describes himself as 'the creation of the
hands of the great gods'. This appears directly after his statement of superiority over his
ancestors and therefore creates a link between his own power and the intentions of the
'great gods'.202 The inference of this line is that Aššurbanipal is only superior to the kings
before him because he is the creation of the gods. This theme is further elaborated on
through the rest of the section. Aššurbanipal states directly that this power is not due to
his own actions but that it was 'the power and strength' of the goddesses which subdued
201 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 20-22
202 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 23



81
the lands which resisted Assyrian rule.203 Lines 7-9 build on the image of other rulers in a
position of subservience to Aššurbanipal. They are described as bringing presents in line
7, directly contrasting how they acted in lines 20-22 where the point is made that they
'did not bring [tribute and] gifts'.204 Lines r.9-r.11 further emphasise Aššurbanipal's status
and therefore the power of the goddesses. The lands which he has subdued are
imagined as being in a position of supplication, kissing Aššurbanipal's feet and seeking
peace with him.205 By emphasising how much they are trying to please him, Aššurbanipal
shows how powerful and fearsome the goddesses have made him.
The last section contains praise directed at Aššurbanipal, final references to the
Ištars of Nineveh and Arbela and an assurance that Aššurbanipal's rule was decreed by
the goddesses. Lines r.11 to r.13 again proclaim the favour the gods have for
Aššurbanipal by stating that he 'calms the heart of the gods'.206 As king, it was
Aššurbanipal's duty to keep the gods happy and to mediate between the gods and his
people. The hymn has already stated that Aššurbanipal was king because he was
chosen by the gods and by referring to the performance of an action that only the king
could perform, the idea of being king through divine will is reinforced. Line r.15 states
203 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 4-6
204 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, 20-22, r.7
205 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, r.9-11
206 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, r.12



82
that 'the great gods' gave Aššurbanipal confidence, presumably in battle, and blessed his
weapons.207 This again attributes Aššurbanipal's success in battle to the gods rather than
his own military prowess.
Lines r.14 to r.16 recall the lines referring to Aššurbanipal's childhood as they call
Ištar of Nineveh his 'mother' and to Ištar of Arbela his 'creator'. This links to lines 13 and
14 where Aššurbanipal declares that he 'knew no mother or father' and 'grew up in the
lap of my [his] goddesses'. The hymn closes with a final assertion that the goddesses
chose Aššurbanipal as king, simultaneously showing the goddesses' relationship with the
king and giving divine legitimacy to his rule.208
3.4Conclusion
ASyncretisticHymntoIštar is both a hymn of praise to Ištar and a list of god’s
names, in which the general Ištar and specific Ištars are referred to and described.
Several sections appear to have been written in a verse form, in which two couplet pairs
are linked by a ‘bridge’ line. The hymn glorifies Ištar attributes, with war and battle being
the most prominent, and syncretises her with other gods and goddesses. The Great
Prayer to Ištar has a more traditional form and appears to be a prayer requesting
207 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela,1290, r.15
208 HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela, r.17 -18



83
assistance from the goddess. There is a distinct emphasis on Ištar as judge and ruler,
which is appropriate for a prayer requesting mercy, especially as the plaintiff feels he has
upset the goddess. Aššurbanipal'sHymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbelashows the
goddesses of Nineveh and Arbela as two distinct beings, rather than aspects of a single
deity. In contrast with the previous texts, it is not dominated by praise but stresses the
relationship between the two Ištars and the king and follows the chronology of the king’s
life.
The final chapter refutes a theory of an eminent Assyriologist, Simo Parpola, who
argued that the nature of Ištar and Assyrian religion could be linked with Christian
tradition; specifically that Assyrian religion was monotheistic. If this theory had been
accepted it would have revolutionised the whole discipline, thus it remains an important
argument despite the theory having been rejected. This chapter also uses the corpus of
Assyrian oracles to explore how Ištar’s worshippers felt she related to them. These
oracles were thought to be relayed directly from the goddess to her prophets and show
what mortals felt Ištar said to them.



84
CHAPTER FOUR
IŠTAR IN ASSYRIAN PROPHECY
4.1TheQuestionofAssyrianMonotheism
The corpus of Assyrian prophecy has been extensively discussed by Simo
Parpola in his contribution to the StateArchivesofAssyria, based on a new edition
and translation of known texts. He uses it to attempt to explain the nature of Ištar,
specifically in relation to Christian theology. He claims that Ištar can be equated to
the Holy Spirit of Christianity and that when she speaks to the king through the
prophecies she is ‘Aššur revealed in his mother aspect’.209 Parpola attempts to
support his theories by interpreting various prophecies in the State Archives of
Assyria Vol. IX as revealing similarities to Christian theology and beliefs. These
interpretations will be examined in detail, alongside the original prophecies later in
this text. As an eminent Assyriologist, Parpola could have overturned all accepted
theories and ideas about Assyrian religion as a whole, as well as the understanding
of Ištar. His ideas were not accepted by the wider academic community and there
209 Parpola 1997: XXVI, original emphasis



85
have been some scathing reviews from Cooper and Kwasman in particular.210
Cooper accuses Parpola of using ‘arguments that are often circular and flawed’ and
of treating his ideas as ‘doctrine more than theory’.211 Kwasman makes a similar
criticism, stating that Parpola tries to force the prophecies to support his theory rather
than altering his theory based on the evidence.212 The most damning assessment
Cooper makes of Parpola’s theories is that he has a strong personal stake in the
origin of ‘”Christian beliefs”’.213 There is currently no scholarship examining Parpola’s
claims in the light of the Assyrian prophecies and Biblical passages he uses as
evidence.
4.1.1 ExaminingtheEvidence
The following passage is one of the key pieces of evidence in Parpola’s theory
of Assyrian monotheism.

20 When your mother gave birth to you, sixty great gods stood with me
and protected you. Sin was at your right side, Šamaš at your left;
25 sixty great gods were standing around you and girded your loins.
27 Do not trust in man. Lift up your eyes, look to me! I am Ištar of
Arbela; I reconciled Aššur with you. When you were small, I took you
with me. Do not fear; praise me!
34 What enemy has attacked you while I remained silent? The future
shall be like the past. I am Nabȗ, lord of the stylus. Praise me!
40 By the mouth of the woman Bayȃ, ‘son’ of Arbela.
Parpola uses this prophecy to link the Assyrian and Christian religious
traditions. He states that the reader ‘cannot help being reminded of the Holy Trinity of
Christianity’, mainly because of the three deities named as speakers within the
text.214 In fact, the reader has to struggle to make this apparently obvious connection.
Parpola’s assertion seems to be based on the assumption that the deity speaking
through the prophecy remains the same throughout. A much more natural
explanation would be that that it is merely a case of multiple deities speaking through
a single prophecy. Cooper suggests this explanation and also suggests that Ištar was
speaking in the name of the other gods.215 Kwasman offers the explanation that each
214 Parpola 1997: XVIII
215 Cooper 2000: 439



87
deity within the oracle is linked to different stages in Esarhaddon’s life.216 This is
entirely plausible; each deity within the oracle can be very clearly linked to a specific
time period. Bel speaks of Esarhaddon’s birth, Ištar of Arbela refers to his childhood
and Nabû appears to be talking about his adult life. The deities could also be talking
exclusively about his birth and childhood. These alternative explanations are more
viable than Parpola’s claim that this is an example of three deities being shown as
‘different hypostases of one indivisible Divine Being’.217
It could be argued that there is some small link to Christian tradition. There are
various examples in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible of people being told to
trust only in God and not to put their trust in other men. Psalm 146 reads ‘Put not
your trust in princes, nor in the son of man’ and Micah chapter 7 verse 5 reads ‘Do
not trust a neighbour, put no confidence in a friend’.218 These are two references of a
recurring theme. These echo a similar theme in K 4310 II where Ištar of Arbela says
to Esarhaddon ‘Do not trust in man. Lift up your eyes, look to me!’.219 It is possible
that this common theme shows some small continuity of tradition. Equally, it could

merely be a similarity that has occurred due to cultural views of gods. If humanity
views their deities as all-knowing and all-encompassing, it makes sense for said
deities to encourage their followers to trust only them. Other humans can never offer
the same protection or assistance for the simple fact that they are not divine.
In discussing these prophecies, Parpola refers to several biblical passages to
establish more similarities between these and the Assyrian prophecies. These are
minor similarities that may hint at a continued tradition but are not the compelling
pieces of evidence that Parpola presents them as. He states that in Isaiah 45, the
Judeo-Christian God gives a similar self-presentation and a similar demonstration of
power in support of his chosen one.220 Both deities present themselves as being
powerful. Aššur proclaims ‘Let them see (it) and praise me, (knowing) that I am
Aššur, lord of the gods’, whilst in Isaiah 45, God continually declares his status as
Lord; ‘And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Saviour; there is
none but me’.221 The supreme deity of the Assyrians and the only deity of the Judeo
Christians both present themselves as being mighty and all-powerful. Surely this is
not a surprising thing? One might expect similar self-presentation in comparable
220 Parpola 1997: XIX; Isaiah 45
221 K 2401, 22-26; Isaiah 45.21-22



89
prophecies from other cultures. Gods at the head of polytheistic cultures and
monotheistic deities will present themselves as superior to all others because that is
their nature. Likewise, the show of power in both texts is entirely unsurprising. Deities
will be seen as using their power to protect their ‘chosen ruler’, especially if this ruler
has been having problems claiming their throne as Esarhaddon had. This is both a
method of legitimising one’s rule and of portraying the gods as righteous and
concerned with the ‘proper’ way of ruling. If the rule of a king was seen as being
divinely ordained, then it was necessary to show that the gods wanted the 'right'
person to rule to ensure that divine ordination continued to be accepted by the
people of the kingdom.
Parpola states that the collection of oracles that make up K 2401222 blend the
identities of Aššur and Ištar in an ‘unexpected and absolutely baffling way’. The main
proof of this claim is that four of the oracles are identified as being spoken by Ištar,
whilst the fifth seems to be Aššur’s personal response to a plea by Esarhaddon.
Parpola argues that oracle 3.3 is the centre of the “covenant tablet of Aššur”223 and
therefore is the essence of this covenant. For Parpola, the fact that Ištar concludes
222 An extract of this prophecy can be found in Appendix II.
223This is how Parpola refers to K 2401 within his commentary



90
the covenant between the gods and Esarhaddon implies, ‘unquestionly’, that Ištar
and Aššur were seen as identical by the prophet.224 Lines 12-15 of the oracle make it
clear that the “covenant of Aššur” was brokered by Ištar and it is referred to as being
between Ištar and her ‘fathers and brothers’.225 It does not follow that Ištar and Aššur
were viewed as being identical. In oracle 3.3, Aššur speaks of how he heard
Esarhaddon’s cry and slaughtered his enemies.226 There is no mention of a future
promise to continue to defend the king, though the idea is present throughout K
2401. This collection of oracles could be examples of how the gods have helped
Esarhaddon in the past, for example Aššur’s assistance in 3.3 and Ištar’s assistance
in 3.5 in conjunction with a covenant between the gods generally and Ištar on behalf
of Esarhaddon. As previously discussed, Ištar was seen as having a special
relationship with the royal family. It is therefore logical that she would be the deity to
intercede with the wider pantheon on behalf of her king. It is possible that Aššur was
viewed as one of the ‘fathers’ which Ištar makes the covenant with, rather than the
two deities were viewed as one being. If this was the case then Parpola’s later query
224 Parpola 1997: XX
225 K 2401, II 35
226 K 2401, II 14, 22



91
of how two gods can appear as identical and distinct in one text is irrelevant.227 They
do not appear here as identical beings, so the question is removed. This also means
that Parpola’s later argument on the Assyrian concept of God needs extensive
rethinking.228
Parpola also states, with no clarification or further explanation, that oracle 3.3
‘powerfully recalls’ Psalm 18. The two share the same theme of a deity, either Aššur
or the Judeo-Christian God, being successfully appealed to for assistance by a
mortal worshipper.229 Both deities rain hailstones and fire upon the enemies of their
supplicant.230 There the similarities appear to end. I doubt very much that any scholar
would agree that this particular oracle ‘powerfully recalls’ Psalm 18. There are certain
similarities but no more so than one would expect from a prophecy involving a mortal
cry for help and a vengeful deity.

4.2CharactersofProphecy
Each of these prophecies was written by a real person for a very specific
purpose. It is not always possible to discern a clear purpose or personality from
ancient texts, however nine of the prophecies discussed by Parpola were written by
four prophets, making specific details easier to identify. Through these prophecies we
can identify personal areas of interest on the part of the prophet as well as common
themes running through the prophecies as a corpus. These two areas will be fairly
well intertwined and may be hard to separate. It may not be possible to identify
whether a specific general theme, such as the safety of the king, is of widespread
personal interest to the prophets or if they were merely following a formula. An
attempt shall be made to identify these formulaic themes as distinct from the
personal concerns of the individual prophets, though this may not always be
possible.
Dunnaša-amur, one of these four prophets, will not be examined as one of her
two prophecies only remains in a fragmentary form.



93
4.2.1Sinqiša-amurofArbela
From reading her prophecies231, it is clear that Sinqiša-amur is very concerned
with the safety of the king and his rule. In both prophecies she talks about putting
enemies in neck-stocks and having vassals bring tribute to Esarhaddon.232 If we
assume that the deity speaking in K 12033 is also Ištar, then some general
statements can be made about the tone of these prophecies. It seems likely that the
deity in K 12033 is Ištar. Sinqiša-amur explicitly names Ištar of Arbela in K 4310 as
the speaker to Esarhaddon, which makes it likely that the speaker in K 12033 is Ištar
of Arbela as it is also addressed to Esarhaddon. The close relationship with
Esarhaddon that the speaker refers to makes this possibility even more likely. The
speaker is referred to as Esarhaddon’s ‘father and mother’ and professes a kind of
ownership and protection of the king.233 This is in line with how many of the other
prophecies refer to the relationship between Esarhaddon and Ištar. A prophet
discussed later, La-Dagil-Ili writes of Ištar referring to herself as ‘a winged bird ov[er
its young]’ in relation to Esarhaddon.234 In a prophecy from Urkittu-Šarrat, Ištar calls

233 K 12033, 26, 29-35
234 K 12033, ii 6-11



94
Esarhaddon ‘my king’ and in a prophecy by an unknown prophet, Ištar declares that
she was Esarhaddon’s midwife and wet-nurse.235
By emphasising this closeness between Esarhaddon and Ištar, Sinqiša-amur
makes it clear that Ištar favours Esarhaddon and his rule. This emphasis on the
relationship between king and goddess, when combined with the theme of protecting
the king and slaughtering his enemies could reflect a general concern amongst the
population of the stability for Esarhaddon’s rule. An unstable rule would have led to
possible revolts or invasions which would have affected the lives of ordinary people.
A stable rule meant that life would have continued as normal and would have been
far preferable. It may also be a reflection of the acceptable way to write prophecies.
Alternatively, Sinqiša-amur may have simply believed that she was a mouthpiece of
an Ištar who supported Esarhaddon. Other oracles which mention Ištar defeating the
king’s enemies include K 4310, and five other prophecies in the K 12033
collection.236 It is important to note that whilst the theme of vanquishing the king’s
enemies is prolific, these prophecies were all written about Esarhaddon so it is
possible that the conflict that occurred at the start of his reign coloured many of the
235 K 12033, ii 32; K 4310, iii 15-23
236 K 4310, i-18, ii 2-8; K 12033, i 10-12, 22



95
prophecies addressed to him.
4.2.2Bayâ,sonofArbela
Bayȃ237 is more concerned with emphasising Esarhaddon’s support from the
gods as a wider group than just Ištar. Ištar is mentioned by name only once, in K
4310 and even that mention is in the wider context of a prophecy from two other
named deities. This could be because Bayȃ as an individual may have felt less of a
personal connection to Ištar than some of the other prophetesses. It may also have
been that Bayȃ thought that Esarhaddon would benefit more from the support of the
one hundred and twenty gods that are envisioned as surrounding him than the very
enthusiastic support of Ištar that is shown in other prophecies.238
Parpola also notes the similarities in terms of the theme of ‘sixty gods’ and the
phrase ‘the future shall be like the past’, which occur in both oracles.239 This phrase
could allude to potential dynastic expectations of Esarhaddon and his successors. In
this context, the future imitating the past appears to refer to the care the gods have
taken over Esarhaddon’s safety and the stability of his rule, which would,
presumably, be extended to the rule of his descendants.

239 K 4310, ii 34-40; K 12033, 26-30



96
4.2.3La-Dagil-Ili
Out of the three prophets examined, La-Dagil-Ili240 is most concerned with
illustrating Ištar’s personal concern with the king. Esarhaddon’s personal safety, as
opposed to the safety of his rule, is mentioned in both of these oracles. Ištar declares
that she will ‘sniff out’ Esarhaddon’s enemies within his palace, which can be linked
to the fear of Esarhaddon being poisoned.241 If there are enemies within the palace
then fear for the king’s safety becomes even more heightened as the identity of these
individuals may not be known, making it easier for them to harm the king through
covert means. Ištar’s declared ‘presence’ within the palace shows a more personal
dimension to the protection of the goddess than some of the more formulaic
statements of defeating enemies on the battlefield, for example the defeat of enemies
found in K 4310, I 4-18.
In connection with Esarhaddon’s personal safety, La-Dagil-Ili also mentions in
both prophecies the safety of his family, in terms of the rule of his descendants. Ištar
reassures Esarhaddon that his ‘son and grandson’ will rule after him.242 This theme
of stability of the ruling family occurs throughout the prophecies, including in the
240 Please see Appendix V for prophecies by La-Dagil-lli.
241 K 12033, ii 6-11; K 4310, vi 19-31
242 K 12033, ii 11-15; K 4310, vi 19-31



97
prophecies authored by Bayȃ. Whilst La-Dagil-Ili expresses it in a particular way, it is
obviously a concern for more than this one prophet and as such could be considered
a more general theme rather than being of specific personal interest.
The collection of prophecies in ‘The Covenant of Aššur’ is also attributable to
La-Dagil-Ili. Again, this further emphasises Ištar’s relationship with Esarhaddon. Ištar
makes an agreement with the gods on behalf of Esarhaddon.243 As well as protecting
Esarhaddon from enemies within his own palace, Ištar is effectively protecting him
from the future ill-will of the gods. Enemies within Esarhaddon’s palace are again
mentioned and Ištar makes it clear that they will be or have been punished.244 One
further common theme between this prophecy and the rest of La-Dagil-Ili’s is the idea
of Ištar rebuking Esarhaddon for a lack of faith. In both K 2401 and K 4310 Ištar
gently upbraids Esarhaddon for apparently doubting her support and in K 2401 she
reminds him more vigorously that he has neglected her cult, despite the assistance
she has given him.245 This displeasure aimed at the king is somewhat unusual in the
prophecy texts as they are often more protective in nature. Therefore it is possible
that La-Dagil-Ili was working to a personal agenda for the good of the cult of Ištar. He

244 K 2401, iv 22-30
245 K 2401, 18-31; K 4310, 3-12



98
reminds the king of the good Ištar and her cult has done for him and uses the
displeasure of Ištar as a means of furthering her cult.
4.3Conclusion
Parpola’s claims of Assyrian monotheism, whilst daring and new, have been
roundly rejected by the academic community, in no small part due to his lack of evidence
and excessive assumptions. Despite having been criticised, few reviews have looked at
the evidence he cited in much detail and this work has attempted to go over the majority
of the evidence with a critical eye. Several of the oracles in the corpus were authored by
three specific prophets. The personal concerns, or the concerns that they felt Ištar had,
can be deduced from recurring themes within their oracles. Sinqiša-amur reports oracles
that are concerned with the safety of the king, Esarhaddon, and the stability of his rule.
Bayâ emphasises the support the gods as a group have for Esarhaddon, rather than just
Ištar and La-Dagil-Ili’s oracles show an Ištar more closely concerned about the king than
either of the other two. The main concern in these oracles is for the personal safety of
the king, rather than his rule. The final section of this study concludes the work and
highlights the most important elements out of those previously discussed.



99
CONCLUSION
This investigation has demonstrated the complexity of Ištar through
examination of a variety of ancient sources. She seems to have played a role in
almost every aspect of life, though the most prominent ones remain those of sexual
love and war. The sheer scale of textual sources that are directly connected with her
make it clear that she was both a popular and important goddess. Her extensive role
in mythology attests a wide-spread popularity and the texts which connect her with
the royal family show her political importance. Her close relationship with the king
means that her cult would have been a powerful force that would have had a
significant influence over the king and the rule of the empire, as can be seen from the
amount of oracular instruction that the king received from Ištar's priesthood.
By juxtaposing these texts in a way which has not occurred previously, Ištar’s
diversity can be recognised as an overriding theme, which the people of
Mesopotamia were well aware of. The use of these texts allows us to see recurring
patterns which have been previously overlooked, as has been explored above.
Agushaya shows just how central strife was to Ištar’s personality. It
emphasises that Ištar is not just the goddess of war. She creates disorder and



100
conflict on a personal level as is manifestly recognised in EnkiandtheWorldOrder
and this can be seen through her antagonistic relationship with the other deities,
including Ea. The poem may end with Ištar calming down but her creation of discord
is still central to the poem. Ṣaltu may disappear, but as the embodiment of Ištar’s
discord, Ṣaltu has not been unmade but reabsorbed into Ištar’s character. The
goddess has merely learnt some self-restraint. Her essential character has not
changed, as can be seen from her continued portrayals in the mythology as a hostile
figure.
Agushaya also shows that the gods’ interactions with each other are far from
smooth. They are not calm and peaceful; they fight with each other and become
impatient in exactly the same way that humans relate to one another. Agushayaalso
stands alone from the other texts examined in this work as it is the only one which
actually mocks Ištar. She is feared, adored and praised in the rest of the sources and
Agushayahas a less-than-reverent attitude. It is not overly obvious, but aspects such
as Ištar’s derisive comments about Ṣaltu, an entity who is similar enough to Ištar to
be mistaken for her, show that this text takes her less seriously than the hymns,



101
prayers and prophecies.246
The hymns and prayers examined in Chapter Three exemplify some of the
more usual ways in which people interacted with their gods. They show clear
attempts at syncretisation, not only in ASyncretisticPrayertoIštar. This makes it
clear that syncretisation is not a modern concept or an attempt to clarify ancient
confusion by modern scholars, but something which interested ancient society.
ASyncretisticHymn shows an attempt to organise the view of Ištar and the
Mesopotamian pantheon in a very unequivocal fashion, using a large number of
other names and goddesses. The structure includes what seems to be a verse
structure with couplets linked thematically. The majority of lines refer to her links with
battle but her astral form is also widely referred to. Unusually, Ištar is referred to as
both Ninlil and Enlil, apparently as a reference to her liminal gender. She is also
portrayed as being superior to the other gods, an unsurprising assertion in a hymn
dedicated to her. Ištar is systematically and comprehensively linked to all major areas
of life, those being the universe (seen in her astral form), the heavens (superiority
over the gods), the earth (concern with human affairs) and the underworld
(syncretism with Ereshkigal). She is shown as being engaged with all aspects of life,
246Agushaya, II ii 9



102
both human and divine.
TheGreatPrayertoIštar requests assistance from Ištar. Such prayers are a
well-known form of communication to the gods. The speaker of the prayer attempts
to persuade Ištar to help him through flattering her. This also has some small
syncretistic effort and shows that syncretising Ištar with other deities was not an
uncommon practise. The prayer has a different purpose to ASyncretisticHymn,but it
still uses multiple names for Ištar. These include the name ‘Guše’a’, which is used for
associations with war, as it is in ASyncretisticHymn. Clearly, specific names could
be used for Ištar based on the capacity she appeared in. A strong theme running
through the text is that of Ištar as a merciful deity. This is linked to her capacity as
ruler which can be seen in other texts, including A Syncretistic Hymn but Ištar is
placed in a position of judgement, instead of just ruler. This is a somewhat unusual
placement and is linked strongly to the purpose of the prayer.
The HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbela shows that at least one king
viewed the Ištars of Nineveh and Arbela as separate goddesses, with distinct actions.
The hymn shows a clear link between the life of Aššurbanipal and the goddesses. In
contrast to TheGreat Prayer, this text is voiced by a named royal, rather than an



103
unnamed, unremarked individual. The focus is placed almost as much on
Aššurbanipal and his deeds, even though they are glorifying the goddesses, as it is
on the Ištars. The two previous texts all but exclude the individual in favour of
celebrating the goddess. In TheGreatPrayer the addressee is in the background of
the text whilst in ASyncretisticHymn the addressee is not mentioned. The Hymnto
theIštarsofNinevehandArbela shows the king engaging the major aspects of his
life with Ištar. There are common themes with the previous hymns, namely rulership,
the goddesses’ superiority and war but there is a major difference in how Ištar is
portrayed. In this hymn and within the prophecy texts, Ištar is portrayed as a maternal
figure. The depiction of Ištar as a patroness is apparently restricted to the king and
the protective streak is somewhat out of character with her representation in other
sources.
The prophecies in Chapter Four have been used by Parpola to produce some
fascinating theories. Unfortunately, his theories are not backed up suitably by the
evidence he provides from the texts, despite his assertions to the contrary. There is
some small argument to be made for a continuity of tradition between Assyrian
religion and Christianity, but to argue that Assyrian religion was both monotheistic



104
and a forerunner of Christianity is simply not viable. His arguments have failed to
convince other academics and where alternative explanations have been offered
they appear to be more credible and obviously plausible than Parpola’s theories.
The prophecies show an exceptionally close link between the cult of Ištar and
the royal family. There seems to have been near-continual communication between
the two and Ištar’s support and advice was obviously valued by the Assyrian kings.
The characters of the prophets and prophetesses show some discrete, as well as
general concerns and it can be seen that these were real individuals who served both
the cult of Ištar as well as the best interests of the king. The interests of the prophets
serve as a filter through which we view the relationship between goddess and king.
The vested interest the prophets would have had for showing Ištar’s concern for the
king must be taken into account when reading these texts, but it must be understood
that these prophecies truly were viewed by both prophets and king as communication
from Ištar. A close relationship between Ištar and the king would have benefitted the
cult, and therefore the prophets, greatly, but this does not mean that oracles were
made-up to benefit the cult of Ištar.
The variety of texts examined shows recurring themes in the communication



105
between Ištar and humanity. As discussed above, she was revered under a variety of
names which are sometimes directly connected with specific incarnations. Whilst the
majority of references to her involve strife of some kind, she is associated widely with
her astral incarnation, as well as being viewed as a ruler in a variety of settings. It
has been demonstrated that the image of Ištar as a motherly figure was reserved for
the royal family, specifically for the king. This comes through strongly in both the
HymntotheIštarsofNinevehandArbelaas well as in the prophecy texts. Ištar does
not seem to have been viewed as a mother by any other individuals.
Ištar’s complexity has been shown above. Her involvement in so many
aspects of life and her contradictory nature is borne out in the textual evidence. She
is both goddess of order and disorder, of love and war and of men and women. This
multiple dichotomy was central to her status and power.

10 Now then, these traitors provoked you, had you banished, and surrounded
you; but you opened your mouth (and cried): “Hear me, O Aššur!”
14 I heard your cry. I issued forth as a fiery glow from the gate of heaven,
to hurl down fire and have it devour them.
18 You were standing in their midst, so I removed them from your presence. I
drove them up the mountain and rained (hail)stones and fire of heaven
upon them.
22 I slaughtered your enemies and filled the river with their blood. Let them
see (it) and praise me, (knowing) that I am Aššur, lord of the gods.
26 This is the well-being (placed) before the Image.
27 This covenant tablet of Aššur enters the king’s presence on a cushion.
Fragrant oil is sprinkled, sacrifices are made, incense is burnt, and they
read it out in the king’s presence.
