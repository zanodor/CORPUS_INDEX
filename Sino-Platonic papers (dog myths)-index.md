SINO-PLATONIC PAPERS is an occasional series dedicated to making available to
specialists and the interested public the results of research that, because of its unconventional or controversial nature, might otherwise go unpublished. The editor-in-chief actively encourages younger, not yet well established, scholars and independent authors to submit manuscripts for consideration. Contributions in any of the major scholarly languages of the world, including romanized modern standard Mandarin (MSM) and Japanese, are acceptable. In special circumstances, papers written in one of the Sinitic topolects (fangyan) may be considered for publication.
Although the chief focus of Sino-Platonic Papers is on the intercultural relations of China with other peoples, challenging and creative studies on a wide variety of philological subjects will be entertained. This series is not the place for safe, sober, and stodgy presentations. SinoPlatonic Papers prefers lively work that, while taking reasonable risks to advance the field, capitalizes on brilliant new insights into the development of civilization.
Submissions are regularly sent out to be refereed, and extensive editorial suggestions for revision may be offered.
Sino-Platonic Papers emphasizes substance over form. We do, however, strongly recommend that prospective authors consult our style guidelines at www.sino-platonic.org/stylesheet.doc. Manuscripts should be submitted as electronic files, preferably in Microsoft Word format. You may wish to use our sample document template, available here: www.sino-platonic.org/spp.dot.
Beginning with issue no. 171, Sino-Platonic Papers has been published electronically on the Web at www.sino-platonic.org. Issues 1–170, however, will continue to be sold as paper copies until our stock runs out, after which they too will be made available on the Web.
Please note: When the editor goes on an expedition or research trip, all operations (including filling orders) may temporarily cease for up to three months at a time. In such circumstances, those who wish to purchase various issues of SPP are requested to wait patiently until he returns. If issues are urgently needed while the editor is away, they may be requested through Interlibrary Loan. You should also check our Web site at www.sino-platonic.org, as back issues are regularly rereleased for free as PDF editions.

Canine Conundrums: Eurasian Dog Ancestor Myths in Historical and Ethnic Perspective

A cynic may be pardoned for thinking
that this is a dog's life. The Greek
word kunikos, from which cynic
comes, was originally an adjective
meaning "doglike," from kuon,
"dog." The word was most likely
applied to the Cynic philosophers
because of the nickname kuon given
to Diogenes of Sinope, the
prototypical Cynic. He is said to
have performed such actions as
barking in public, urinating on the leg
of a table, and masturbating on the
street.

PREFACE
When Donald Sutton first invited me to write this paper, he gently gibed at me by
saying that I would probably bring in Egypt and India. My ready reply was that I had no
such intention. Before I embarked on the research for this paper, I thought that the subject
was restricted wholly to the South of China, thus writing about it would be short, sweet,
and simple. Little did I expect that following up all the loose ends would take me not only
to India and Egypt, but to almost everywhere else in between!
INTRODUCTION
Bottle gourd (calabash) symbolism is ubiquitous in Chinese popular religion. It
may be traced back to soutbern, originally non-Sinitic, cosmogonic and anthropogonic
myths baving to do with chaos, creation, the flood, and the peopling of the world. In
particular, Tai and Tibeto-Burman peoples such as the Dai and the Ne (Modem Standard
Mandarin Yi{2}; traditional designation Lolo [currently considered to be pejorative by
many authorities]) regard the bottle gourd as central to the genesis of the universe and
themselves. Thus, the pervasive cucurbitic symbolism of Chinese culture is testimony to
the gradual absorption by the Han people of southern, essentially, non-Han myths.
On the other hand, there is a widespread myth that many southern peoples were the
descendants of a dog named P'an-bu{3 }. It is curious that the second graph of the most
common form of this name is that for bottle gourd. The source of this dog-ancestor myth
is obscure, but it appears initially to have been perpetuated largely among the Han peopl~
and only gradually did it become adopted by some of the southern peoples themselves.
It is well known, of course, that the dog is a common device throughout Eurasia for
ascribing lowly, bestial origins to the "other". Thus, the conjunction of the dog-ancestor
and the calabash in the context of the southern encounter between Han and non-Han attests
a curious inversion in which the Han exchange "other" for "self" and the non-Han
exchange "self' for"other".
BOTTLE-GOURD MYTHS
This section may be kept mercifully brief by referring the reader to a recent article of
the author entitled "Southern Bottle-Gourd (hu-Iu{ 4}) Myths in China and Their
Appropriation by Taoism" and to the extensive bibliographical references included therein. 1
Here it is necessary only to point out that, south of the Yangtze, bottle-gourd myths are
2

Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
coherent, integral, consistent, ritually powerful, and widespread, whereas, north of the
Yangtze, they are fractured and often dimly understood. This is just the opposite with
mythical accounts of southern dog-ancestors which are fragmented and frequently
incoherent in the south, whereas in the north they are prone to be lengthy, involved, and in
general highly historicized. On the basis of these initial impressions, we may hypothesize
that the bottle-gourd myths are the authentic heritage of the non-Han peoples living south of
the Yangtze, whereas the dog-ancestor myths have primarily been initiated, elaborated, and
fostered by Han peoples stemming from north of the Yangtze. The goal of the present
investigation is to examine the evidence for and against this hypothesis.
DOG-ANCESTOR MYTHS
Since the second century, Chinese sources have made sporadic reference to an
ethnogonic myth which asserts canin~ ancestry for various peoples living to the south of
the Yangtze River. The dog-ancestor myth finds its first full and more or less complete
expression in Kan Pao's{5} Sou shen chi{6} (Records ofSearching for the Supernatural),
the first story in scroll 14. Kan Pao (fl. 318) firmly believed that the "spiritual" or
"supernatural" (shen{7}) was just as important a part of the historical record as the
mundane, if not more so, and it was this conviction which spurred him to· record as many
manifestations of the spirit world as he could. Here is the story of the dog-ancesor, P'an
hu, as narrated by Kan Pao:
Origins of the Marn{8}2 Barbarians
In the time of Kao-hsin{9} an elderly woman attached to the palace suffered from
an earache for some time. The physician treated her and removed an insect the size of a
silkworm cocoon. When the woman left, the physician placed the insect in a gourd pot
(hu { 10}) and covered it with a dish (p 'an { 11 }). In no time it turned into a dog. mottled
with colorful patches. This is why the dog was called P'an-hu, and it was reared by the
physician.
At that time the Wu barbarians{ 12} had become numerous and strong and several
times penetrated the borders. Generals were sent against them but could not gain
victories. A declaration was sent throughout the kingdom: "Anyone bringing in the head
of the Wu leader will be rewarded with a thousand catties of gold. an appanage of ten
thousand households, and the hand of the emperor's youngest daughter."
3



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
Sometime later P'an-hu appeared carrying a head in its mouth and went straight
to the palace. The king examined the head and concluded that it belonged to the Wu
leader. What was he to do?
His officers all said, "P'an-hu is a domestic animal: he cannot be allowed to join
the ranks of officials and certainly cannot be given your daughter to wed! Though he has
achieved this merit, he cannot be given that reward."
When his youngest daughter heard this, she addressed the king: "Since Your
Majesty promised me to anyone in the world and P'an-hu brought you the head, ridding
your kingdom of danger, we have here the will of Heaven. This is not something P'an
hu's intelligence could have contrived. Kings must keep promises, rulers must be
believed. You cannot repudiate your word, clearly given to the world, for the sake of my
humble person; that would result in calamity for your kingdom."
The king feared she was right and ordered her sent to P'an-hu.
The dog took the girl into the southern hills where the undergrowth was so dense
the feet of men never trod. There she discarded her court robes, donned those of a
common freeman, and bound herself to P'an-hu as his servant. He then led her over
mountains and through valleys until they reached a cave in the rocks.
Now, the king sorely missed his daughter. and he often sent men forth in search
of her. However, the heavens would always rain, the mountain peaks would shake, and
clouds would so darken the sky that his men could not reach her.
Nearly three years passed. The princess had given birth to six boys and six girls
when P'an-hu died. Their offspring married one another. They wove cloth from the bark
of trees dyed with the juices of berries and fruits -- for they loved colorful garments -- and
they cut the cloth to fit their tails.
Later, their mother returned to the palace, and the king sent envoys to welcome
the children -- this time the heavens did not rain. But their clothes were outlandish, their
speech barbaric,* they squatted on their haunches to eat and drink and preferred mountain
wilds to cities. The king acceded to their wishes and gave them famed mountains and
broad swamps for their home. They were called Marn barbarians.
The Marn barbarians appear stupid but are in fact crafty. They are contented in
the lands they inhabit and set store by their old ways. They believe they were given
strange capacities by the will of Heaven. and therefore they act under laws not common to
others. They farm and they trade, but have no documents to show at borders, no
identifications or tallies -- nor do they have rents or taxes of any sort. They live in small
villages where the headmen Me given tallies and wear crowns of otter skin, for the Mam
secure their food from the waters.

Presently the Commanderies of Liang, Han, Pa, Shu, Wu-Iing, Ch'ang-sha, and
Lu-chiang{ 13} are all inhabited by Marn. They eat rice gruel mixed with the flesh of
various fish, they pound on containers and howl to honor P'an-hu with sacrifices. This
custom has lasted until the present day. The above are the reasons for OUf saying:
Bare buttocks, yellow trousers do
Reveal descendants of P'an-hu.3
*One annotator says the nonsense compound chu-li{l4} indicated how their speech
sounds to Han Chinese.
Kan Pao's fascination with plan-hu was repeated in his now-lost Chin-chi {IS} [Annals of
Chin] where he declared that various groups of Yi living in the south were descendants of
plan-hu and described the sacrifices that they made to him.4
Kao-hsin, also known as Kao-hsin shih{ 16} ("of the clan name Kao-hsin"), is Ti
klu{17} ("Emperor Klu"), the mythical great-grandson of Huang-ti{IS} ("Yellow
Emperor"), allegedly surnamed Kung-sun{ 19} ("Ducal Grandson"), the supposed founder
of Chinese civilization and of the first Chinese state. If it is possible to assign any sort of
historicity to the Yellow Emperor, he would have to be placed around the middle of the
third millennium BCE and in the northwest of China.5 Thus, it is highly unlikely that Kao
hsin (if he himself ever existed) could have had anything whatsoever to do with the
southern peoples whom the Han people were making contact with during the late second
and early third centuries CE and who were the inspiration for the cynanthropomorphic
stories about plan-hu and his descendants. Thus, almost from the beginning of the plan
hu myth, our suspicions concerning its authenticity as a self-expression of the southern
nan-Han peoples are aroused.
The story about plan-hu occurred already in the Feng-su t'ung-yi {20 }
[Comprehensive Connotations of Customs] by Ying Shao{21} (fl. 190),6 but it was lost
and had to be restored from the Hou Han shu{22) (History of the Later Han). Despite the
patently fantastic nature of the story about plan-hu in Feng-su t'ung-yi, Fan Yeh{23}
(398-445) adopted it wholesale for his "Nan Man chuan{24} (Biography of the Southern
Mam)," scroll 116 in the History ofthe Later Han:
Formerly, in the time of Kao-hsin, that emperor was troubled over the banditry and
depradations of the Dog Jung, but his attacks on them were unsuccessful. A chieftain of this
tribe named General Wu {25) was especially formidable. So volunteers were solicited from all

over the empire: whoever could obtain the head of a certain General Wu, a leader of the Dog
Jung, would be given a thousand yi of gold, a portion of land large enough to support ten
thousand families, and the emperor's youngest daughter.
Now at that time, the emperor had a domesticated dog whose fur was of five colors,
called P'an-hu. After this proclamation had been given, P'an-hu, holding a human head in his
mouth, came up to the imperial palace. The courtiers all wondered at it, and when they
examined it, they found it to be General Wu's head. The emperor was greatly pleased. His
intention was to reward the dog, but he did not know how to do so appropriately, since P'an-hu
could not very well be given a girl as wife or granted rank and emolument. But when his
daughter heard of all this, she felt that the emperor could not go back on what he had
proclaimed, so she asked permission to put the command into effect. The emperor then had no
choice but to give his daughter to P'an-hu. P'an-hu, having obtained a wife, bore her on his
back to Nan-shan{26} ["Southern Mountain," in the Lu-chih{27} district of Hunan province],
stopping at a stone chamber. That place was extremely treacherous: no human tracks went up
to it. There the girl took off her clothes, made ap'u-chien{28} (dog-coiffure) hair arrangement,
and donned a tu-li{29} (dog-tailed) dress. The emperor was sorrowful and missed her, and sent
envoys to search for her, but these met with winds, rains, earthquakes, and darkness, and could
advance no farther. Three years after this marriage, the girl gave birth to twelve children, six
of each sex. Then P'an-hu died. These children then took each other as husbands and wives.
They wove tree bark and dyed it with vegetable juices; they liked five-color clothing, and the
fashion and cut of their clothes always left a tail at the end. Their mother later returned to court,
in order to present an appeal to Kao-hsin, the White Emperor, whereupon he summoned his
grandchildren to his court. Their clothing was of variegated color, and their speech sounded
like chu-li. They preferred living in mountain and ravine areas and did not care for flat, open
country. The emperor acceded to their wishes, bestowing upon them spacious mountains and
wide marshes. Their descendants multiplied, and have since been known as Marn-yi, or
barbarians. They are cunning but appear silly; they are conservative regarding the old customs
and love to stay at home. Because their ancestral father [P'an-hu1 achieved merit and their
ancestral mother was an emperor's daughter. they are exempt from taxation even though they
make commercial use of their fields. They have villages and lords and chieftains; all of the
latter are given [or: bestow to their own ministers1 seals of office. Their caps are made of otter
skin. Their great leaders are called ching-fu{30} (spirited fellow); they call each other yang
t ru{3]}.7
The Marn people of present day Wu-ling in Ch'ang-sha [Hunan] are a branch of
these. 8

This is actually the manner in which the "Biography of the Southern Barbarians" in the
History of the Later Han begins. Fan Yeh provides no additional contextutalizing
information and offers no indication of any sort that this account is purely mythical. For
the innocent reader of his "Biography", the account is simply presented as a sequence of
historical facts. Thus, with the de facto imprimatur of the Chinese empire, the canine
ancestry of the southern "barbarians" was sanctioned by its historiographical apparatus and
enshrined in a succession of official dynastic histories which repeated it.
By the late T'ang period, the P'an-hu myth was firmly accepted as historical fact.
In the much-quoted Man shu{32} (Book of the Marn) of Fan Ch'o{33}, who had served
as a secretary of Ts'ai Hsi {34}, the Chinese Governor of Tongking (N.B.), the account of
P'an-hu from the beginning of the "Biography" in the History of the Later Han is quoted
matter-of-factly. The Man shu was completed shortly after the beginning of the Hsien
t'ung{35} ("Total Comprehension") reign period (860-873), in 863. It is worth noting,
however, that Fan Ch'o follows up his quotation of the P'an-hu story from the History of
the Later Han with another fantastic tale, which itself would seem to be a somewhat
distorted variant of the one in the "Biography":
According to the Kuang yi chi{36} [Extensive Records ofExtraordinary Thingsp
of Wang rung-ming{ 37}, it is said: In the time of Kao-hsin, a dog was born in a man's
family. At first it was like a young bullock (t'e{ 38}). Its master considered the dog to be
monstrous (kuai (39}) and abandoned it by the road. After seven days it was not dead.
The animals suckled it. Its form grew bigger and bigger day by day. Its master took it
back. At the time when he first abandoned it by the roadside, he had covered it with a
plate (p'an) containing leaves (or: contained it in a plate and covered it with leaves).1 0
So regarding it as auspicious, he then offered it to the Emperor; and it was called P'an-hu
("Plate-Gourd").
Afterwards it achieved merit by successfully biting off the head of the Western
Barbarian (jung{ 40}) bandit, General Wu. The emperor gave it in marriage the Imperial
Princess, and enfeoffed P'an-hu as Marquis Pacifier of the Frontier (Ting-pien-hou{ 41) ).
The princess gave birth to seven lumps of flesh. On cutting them open, there were seven
males. When they grew up, each acknowledged one surname. Nowadays, in the eastern
part of Pa [eastern Szechwan], the surnames are Tien, Lei, Tsai,11 Hsiang, Meng, Min,
and Shu-sun{42} families. Their posterity proliferated greatly. From Ch'ien-nan (i.e.,
the south of Kweichow). they overpassed the land of K'un (Yunnan?), Hsiang (Hunan),
and Kao-li (43} [Korea!], and formed a kingdom of their own. King Yu{ 44} (fl. 781-769

Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
BCE) was killed by Ch'iian-jung{ 45} ("Dog Barbarians"), that is to say, by their
descendants.
The skin and bones of P'an-hu are still visible today in Ch'ien-chung{ 46} (the
central part of Kweichow). The T'ien, Lei, and other families from time to time make
sacrifice to them. 12
By the very title of the work from which it is taken, this is a record of the "strange" or
"extraordinary," yet Fan Ch'o accepts it as containing reliable ethnographic data for
explaining the ancestry of the Southern Marn.
THE IDENTITY OF THE MARN
Regrettably, the etymology of Marn is obscure. The earliest (bronze inscriptional)
fonn of the graph used to write this name was without the "insect' bug' wonn" radical that
was added to the later seal forms by the Han period. The word that the early, "insect' bug
, worm"-less graph stands for is now pronounced luan{ 47} 'and is said by most Chinese
specialists on the script originally to have meant "chaotic".13 .This is purely because of
chance similarity (but not identity 14) of sound with the word for "chaotic" now
pronounced luan {48} and the desire to disparage the Marn by intimating that they were
unruly.1 5 In Chou times, however, the phonophore in the graph used to write Marn
would have had an initial labial-liquid cluster, probably ml-, which devolved into separate
series of words now pronounced luan or lilan and man. A few other graphs with the same
phonophore are now pronounced pien,wan, and shuan. While it is difficult to determine
what the root meaning of this phonophore originally was, judging from the meanings of the
two dozen or so graphs that it is now a part of, it would appear to have signified "tied up
neatly' tightly> cramped, contracted, mincing, tiny."
Actually, all of this etymologizing of the phonophore in the graph used to write
Marn should be irrelevant, since Mam was initially the Sinitic transcription of the sound of
the ethnonym and would have had nothing to do with the meaning of the native term.. Yet
the urge to ascribe a pejorative connotation to the transcription was visually and
semantically reinforced by the addition of the "insect' bug' wormII radical. The Shuo-wen
chieh-tzu{49} [Explanation of Simple and Compound Graphs] (c. 100 CE) states
succinctly the reason for affixing the "insect' bug' worm" radical to the graph: liThe
Southern Marn belong to the race of serpents, hence man is composed of the 'insect' bug /
worm' signific and the luan > man phonetic{50} .,,16 Linguistically, of course, both the
semantic interference of the phonophore and the addition of the "insect' bug' worm"
8



Victor H. Mair, "Canine ConundrumsII
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
radical are entirely specious, but they are vital clues to studying the history of Han attitudes
toward their southern neighbors. The contemptuous intention of the name Marn, as used
by the Han, is evident from the Sinitic compounds and phrases in which it is found, most
of which signify such notions as "savage, rude, unreasonable, brutal," and so forth.
Regardless of the pseudoetymological attempts to distort its meaning, Mam was
undoubtedly the Sinitic transcription of the ethnonym of some southern people, but what
that originally was is not now clearly known. I suspect that it may have been Mon, an
ethnonym having ancient roots (written inscriptions in Old Mon exist already from the sixth
century17) that ranges from northeastern India through Burma to Cambodia and Thailand.
Less likely (in terms of the probable linguistic affinities, geographical distribution, and
historical development of the Marn peoples), the Sinitic transcription may have derived
from Mien, a native name for the Yao.
Another widely and indiscriminately used name for southern non-Hannic peoples,
Miao{Sl} (often in combination with Mam as Miao-Marn{S2}), is derived from a form of
the ethnonym Hmong and originally had nothing whatsoever to do with the notion of
"sprouts," which is purely a deceptive transcriptional artifact.1 8 That did not deter the
Han-Chinese from inventing all sorts of quaint stories about how it was necessary to tend
the Miao as a farmer cultivates the plants in his fields. Here again, we witness the
formidable power of the sinographic script to concretize adventitious semantic overtones.
Not only is the etymology of the ethnonym Marn obscure, its usage is highly
perplexing. In the first place, it has both a broad and a narrow meaning. The broad
meaning is applied in the same way as the broad meaning of Miao, viz., to all the various
non-Han ethnic groups of South China. Before the T'ang period, this was more or less the
manner is which the name Mam was used. After the Sung, however, the term Miao or
Miao-Marn in combination was regularly used to cover all the tribal peoples of the south.
In the narrow sense of the name, Marn continued to be used in reference to those peoples
calling themselves the descendants of plan-hu or what might be termed the plan-hu group.
During the twentieth-century, these included the Yao (in Hunan, Kwangtung, Kwangsi,
and Yunnan), the She{53} (or Hsia) (of Fukien and Chekiang), and the Mam or Yao (of
-northern Tongking).19
Who were these people supposedly claiming descent from the dog-ancestor P'an
hu? Chungshee Hsien Liu has published claims that the four transcribed terms in the
account of the Southern Marn from the History of the Later Han are actually Thai
("Siamese") words.20 Despite considerable effort, using both the Modern Standard
Mandarin pronunciations and early medieval reconstructions of the Sinitic transcriptions, I
have not been able to confirm. that these words actually exist(ed) in any modern or ancient
9



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November. 1998)
Thai language or dialect.21 Unfortunately, many otherwise reputable scholars (whose
names, out of respect, I shall not mention here) have uncritically accepted Liu's claim.
This has led to the widespread assumption that the P'an-hu myth has its roots among Thai
peoples. But Liu was hopelessly vague on this point, stating that the majority of the "ten
tribal groups in Southern China, if not more," the best known of whom are "the Miao, the
Yao, the Lolo, the Li, the Shan, the Shaka, etc." "are said to be akin to the Nesiots [sic] ...
and others to the Proto-Malay. Culturally they belong to the Indonesian [sic] school of
civilization with considerable Chinese influence." Liu was also egregiously wrong about
the languages involved, regarding "Siamese, Burmese and so on" as "belong[ing] to the
same linguistic family". Furthermore, Liu gullibly takes almost all the details of the
numerous P'an-hu myth variants more or less at face value and readily applies them to
historical and ethnographic research.
There is evidence which leads me to believe that the four Marn terms cited in the
History of the Later Han may actually be Vietnamese or a language closely akin to
Vietnamese.22 For example, ching-fu (said by Fan Yeh to refer to the leaders of the Marn;
roughly reconstructed as *tsiayngpooeh for the fifth century) closely matches Vietnamese
trtrl!ng-ph8 ("precinct head"), hang-t'u (said by Fan Yeh to mean "we"; --> hang-t'u [see
note 7]; roughly reconstructed as *kyangduh for the fifth century) strongly resembles
Annamite kyung-toi ("we"),23 and p'u (said by Fan Yeh to be part of a word meaning
"dog-coiffure"; roungly reconstructed as *bawk for the fifth century) is almost identical to
Vietnamese bu~c (lito tie, bind up"; e.g., bu~c gut ["to tie a knot"]). It would seem,
therefore, that the four supposedly Marn words recorded by Fan Yeh in the story about
P'an-hu from the History of the Later Han are most likely of Austroasiatic (specifically
Mon-Khmer) origin, not Austro-Tai or Tibeto-Burman.24 This conforms to the suggestion
made above that the Chinese transcription Marn may have been derived from the name
Mon.
GENESIS OF THE P'AN-HU MYTH
We must now attempt to determine where and when the embryonic form of the
plan-hu story entered the consciousness of Chinese authors so that they could begin to
elaborate it and gradually (perhaps unconsciously) impose it upon their southern neighbors.
A key to clarifying these issues is the Shan-hai ching{54} [Classic ofMountains and Seas]
and its use of the name "Ch'tian-jung (Dog lung)". The lung were a supposedly war-like
people living to the west and northwest (N.B.!) of the Chinese. While other texts such as
the Tso chuan{55} [Tso's Chronicle] and Kuo-yii{56} [Conversations of the States] had
10



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
already used the term Ch'tian-jung, they in all likelihood meant no more by the fIrst element
of it than "ferocious, wild, bellicose". The Classic of Mountains and Seas, however,
comes right out and states that the Ch'uan-jung resemble dogs ([ch'i] chuang ju
ch'itan {57}).
The Classic ofMountains and Seas also mentions, in tandem with the Ch'iian-jung,
a Ch'iian-feng kuo{58} ("Dog-Fief Kingdom") that they inhabit.25 Furthennore, dogs
and dog-like monsters or people with canine features (voices [Le., barks], bodies, tails,
heads [the cynocephali], etc.) are mentioned at least 35 times in the Classic ofMountains
and Seas. 26 All of this canine fantasy must have made a profound impression upon the
Chinese psyche during the late classical and early medieval periods when the P'an-hu myth
was being devised.
Chinese scholars from the days of Kuo P'u{59} (276-324) to the present have
invariably related the P'an-hu myth to the Ch'tian-jung.27 By the time Fan Ch'o wrote his
Book of the Mam, the Ch'iian-jung were being identified explicitly as the descendants of
P'an-hu (see the quotation above). As we attempt to unravel the intricacies of the P'an-hu
myth and its variants, we must bear in mind that, whereas the Ch'iian-jung were located to
the northwest, the Marn and other peoples who are alleged to be the descendants of P'an
hu were all situated far away in the south. The P'an-hu myth, therefore, contains a
disturbing discordancy at its very core
Once the actual caninity of the Ch'tian-jung is established, this leads to even more
fantastic mythical musings which involve Huang-ti (the Yellow Emperor). In scroll 12 of
The Classic ofMountains and Seas, after an entry dealing with Hsi-wang-mu{60} (Mother
Queen of the West), there occurs the following declaration: "The Dog-Fief Country is
called Dog-Jung Country. Its people have the appearance of dogs."{61} Kuo Pu's note,
commenting on the second sentence, states as follows: "The Yellow Emperor's
descendant, Pien-ming, begat two white dogs, one male and one female, whence arose this
country which is called the Hound Country." {62 }28 This is an amazing statement, since it
connects the Yellow Emperor, father of the Chinese nation., with the Dog Jung
("[North]westem Barbarians"). Like the plan-hu myth for the Mam, it also attributes
incest to the Dog Jung. This is a common theme in Han myths about peripheral peoples.
Kuo plu's note about the Hound Country was probably derived from another
passage in scroll 17 of The Classic ofMountains and Seas: "In the Great Wasteland, there
are the Jung-fu Mountains into which flows the Shun River. There is a man there called
IDog Jung'. The Yellow Emperor begat Miao-Iung., Miao-lung begat Jung-wu, Jung-wu
begat Nung29-ming, and Nung-ming begat a white dog. The white dog was
hermaphroditic, thus giving rise to the Dog Jung30 who are meat eaters." {63 }31

Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
In his So-yin {64} [Tracing the Hidden Meanings] commentary to the "Hsiung-nu
chuan{65} [Biography of the Huns]" from the Shih-chi{66} [Records of the Scribe], Ssu
rna Chen{67} (eighth century), further distorts the gist of this story by misreading and
misciting it as follows: "The Yellow Emperor begat Miao ("Sprout"), Miao begat Lung
CDragon"), Lung begat Jung ("Ferociousll
), Jung begat Wu ("I"), Wu begat Ping-ming
("Conjoined Brightness"), Ping-ming begat Pai ("White") and Pai begat a dog. The dog
had two stout [offspring?].32 These were the Dog Jung."{68}33
Still more intriguing is the assertion elsewhere in the Classic of Mountains and
Seas, scroll 18, that the Yellow Emperor was also the ancestor of a horse: liThe Yellow
Emperor begat Lo-ming ('Camel Bright') and Lo-ming begat a white horse. This white
horse was Kun." {69 }34 This is an astonishing and very risky proposition, for it declares
that Kun, the father of Yii{70}, was quite literally an equine. Since Yii (mythic tamer of
the Yellow River) was the founder of the hypothetical Hsia Dynasty, this calls into question
the paternity of the entire Chinese nation. If, however, we accept the thesis of Tsung-tung
Chang that the Yellow Emperor was an Indo-European nomad of the steppes, it would
make perfect sense that one of his descendants would have been identified with a horse and
another with a dog. What would be more natural totemic devices for cattle-herding nomads
than horses and dogs?
The dating of the Classic of Mountains and Seas, which would appear to be the
chief source of much of this intricately interwoven fantasy, is extraordinarily vexed. Some
parts of it may derive from as early as the fourth or fifth century BCE, but the main
redaction was most likely carried out during the Han period (roughly the two centuries
before and after the beginning of the Common Era), and there appear to have been
substantial interpolations from still later periods.35 Furthermore, the portions of the
Classic ofMountains and Seas in which reference is made to the canine barbarians of the
west are recognized by the majority of scholars to be among the later additions to the text.
We may assume that they were composed not long after the beginning of the Common Era.
This is not to deny, however, that the Ch'tian-jung ("Dog Jung") were unknown until that
time. Indeed, they are frequently mentioned in oracle shell and bone inscriptions of the
Shang period (c. 1200 BCE).36
This rough dating is significant in two respects: 1. it is situated just after the tempo
of Chinese contacts with the West increased dramatically; 2. it comes just before the earliest
stories about P'an-hu begin to appear in China. We have already been exposed to the
evidence for the latter phenomenon above. As for the former, when confronted with an
impressive body of comparative evidence assembled by F. de M61y, Wang Yi-Chung, H.
Maspero, and B. Laufer, Needham admitted37 that many of the fabulous beings mentioned
12



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
in the Classic ofMountains and Seas were virtually identical with those found in Greek and
Latin authors (Herodotus [5th c. BCE], Strabo [mid 1st. c. BCE-early 1st c. CE], Pliny
[23-79], Gaius Julius Solinus [Collectanea Rerum Memorabilium, 3rd c. CE], et al.).
What is more, the illustrations for the Classic of Mountains and Seas assembled by Kuo
P'u and later editors were often reminiscent of illustrations of strange creatures in Solinus
and other Western sources. These depictions of the fantastic surely had an enormous
impact upon the Chinese imagination. This is made quit~ plain in a famous poem by T'ao
Ch'ien{71} (365-427), who was born just four decades after Kuo P'u was executed for a
failed prophecy:
On Reading the Seas and Mountains Classic
In early summer when the grasses grow
And trees surround my house with greenery,
The birds rejoice to have a refuge there
And I, too, love my home.
The fields are plowed and the new seed planted
And now is time again to read my books.
This out-of-the-way lane has no deep-worn ruts
And tends to turn my friends' carts away.
With happy face I pour the spring-brewed wine
And in the garden pick some greens to cook.
A gentle shower approaches from the east
Accompanied by a temperate breeze.
I skim through the Story of King Mu
And view'the pictures in the Seas and Mountains Classic.
A glance encompasses the ends of the universe -
Where is there any joy, if not in these?38
We should observe that by far the largest proportion of these extraordinary beings depicted
in the Classic of Mountains and Seas were thought of as inhabiting the heart of Eurasia,
that vast unknown space'to which the inquisitive souls of East Asia have perennially been
drawn. This was the jade-producing K'un-Iun{72} of the Chou period, the intoxicating
abode of the Queen Mother of the West from the Warring States and Han periods, the
exotic Western Regions during the T'ang period, and the fabled land of the Silk Road
(Japanese Shiruku Rodo) in modern times. We may also note that T'ao Ch'ien's other
13



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
favorite book, the Story of King Mu, was also about the Han-Chinese fascination with the
fables of Central Asia in antiquity.39
Early Chinese maps which attempted to locate the phantasmagoria of the Classic of
Mountains and Seas in the context of geographic realia put the land of the Dog-Men to the
northwest.40 The earliest Chinese records concerning the lung place them in the west
during the Shang and Chou periods (hence they are often also referred to collectively as the
Hsi-jung{73} ["Western Jung"]). Later, various branches of the lung appear to have
spread farther to the northwest, north, and other peripheral areas of China. Modem
geographers and historians place the Dog-Fief Country in the T'ai-hang mountain region of
Shansi, but recognize an earlier and more distant association with the Minusinsk Basin.41
This location is highly suggestive, since it was the center of the Andronovo and Afanasievo
cultures, Neolithic outposts of what were most likely Indo-European nomads.42 We may
further remark that, both in Chinese and in Western sources, the cynanthropomorphized
Central Asian peoples were often juxtaposed with an Amazonian race of women who are
now being archeologically substantiated by Jeannine Davis-Kimball.43
P'AN-HU AND P'AN-KU
As if the vagaries surrounding the origins and identity of P'an-hu were not
daunting and disconcerting enough, they are compounded by massive confusion with
another cosmogonic and anthropogonic mythical figure, P'an-ku{74}, who emerged
(probably not inconsequentially) at about the same time as P'an-hu. According to Bodde,
the latter is China's "only clearly recognizable creation myth.,,44 The earliest tellings of the
myth about P'an-ku date to the third century CE:
Heaven and earth were in chaos like a chicken's egg, and plan Ku was born in the
middle of it. In eighteen thousand years Heaven and earth opened and unfolded. The
limpid that was Yang became the heavens, the turbid that was Yin became the earth. plan
Ku lived within them, and in one day he went through nine transformations, becoming
more divine than Heaven and wiser than earth. Each day the heavens rose ten feet higher.
each day the earth grew ten feet thicker, and each day P'an Ku grew ten feet taller. And so
it was that in eighteen thousand years the heavens reached their fullest height, earth
reached its lowest depth, and P'an Ku became fully grown. Afterward, there were the
Three Sovereign Divinities. Numbers began with one, were established with three,
perfected by five, multiplied with seven, and fixed with nine. That is why Heaven is
ninety thousand leagues from earth. (San Wu Ii chi{75} [A Calendrical Record of the
14



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
Three Kings and Five Emperors] of Hsii Cheng{76}, cited in Yi-wen lei-chii{77}
[Categorized Gathering ofBelles Lettres], compiled in 642, Chung-hua edition, 1.2a)
When the firstborn, P'an KUt was approaching death, his body was transformed.
His breath became the wind and clouds; his voice became peals of thunder. His left eye
became the sun; his right eye became the moon. His four limbs and five extremities
became the four cardinal points and the five peaks. His blood and semen became water
and rivers. His muscles and veins became the earth's arteries; his flesh became fields and
land. His hair and beard became the stars; his bodily hair became plants and trees. His
teeth and bones became metal and rock; his vital marrow became pearls and jade. His
sweat and bodily fluids became streaming rain. All the mites on his body were touched
by the wind and were turned into the black-haired people. (Hsii Cheng, Wu yiin li-nien
chi{78} [A Chronicle of the Five Cycles o/Time}, cited in Yi shih{79} [Surmises about
History}, preface dated 1670, Pi-chi ts'ung pien{ 80} [Collectanea of Brush Records]
edition, 1.2a)45
Later, as so often happens, the P'an-ku myth was profusely elabor~ted in Ko Hung's{81}
fourth-century Shen hsien chuan{82} [Biographies o/Deities and Transcendentsl and other
texts. Furthermore, all sorts of intricate and fanciful etymologies ("coiled oldness," "basin
secure," "eggshell-solid," "research antiquity," "aboriginal abyss," etc.) were invented to
justify the initially nonce and arbitrary sinographic transcription of the hero's name. Be
that as it may, there is no mistaking the close parallels between the P'an-ku myth and the
myth about Puru~a, the cosmic man fIrst mentioned in the celebrated ancient Indian hymn
known as "Puru~a-siikta" (.~gveda,X.90) and described as pervading or equivalent to the
universe.46 Since most careful and critical scholars would date the IJgveda to around 1300
BeE on linguistic, literary, archeological, and historical grounds,47 and since there is a
whole succession of other early Indian texts on the same theme dating from that time down
to the rise of the P'an-ku myth, there can be little doubt concerning the priority of Purusa
over P'an-ku.48
As Fred~rick Mote has perceptively observed, the P'an-ku myth not only surfaces
late in Chin~ it is also antithetical to the traditional organismic Chinese view of "the world
and man as uncreated, as constituting the central features of a spontaneously self-generating
cosmos having no creator, god, ultimate cause or will external to itself."49
Aside from the cosmic hero himself, other Indian elements associated with the
Puru~a myth that have obvious analogs in Chinese mythology and cosmology are
15



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
brahma'.lr/a, the cosmic egg which the Pur~as describe as an envelope or shell containing
manas ("mind"), prii!la ("breath", similar to ch'i{83} [varporous material energy] in
Chinese cosmology), and the pancabhuta ("five elements", comparable to the wu
hsing{ 84} [five phasic elements] in Chinese metaphysics). How and when the Puru~a
myth made its way to China is not precisely known, but it may not necessarily have come
from India, since the same myth is found in other branches of the Indo-European family
(e.g., the dismemberment of the giant Ymir in Scandinavian mythology).50
In chapter 1 (pp. 1-40) of his Myth, Cosmos, and Society, Bruce Lincoln surveys a
large body of myths which explain the genesis of the world and all that is in it as the result
of the sacrificial dismemberment of a giant man. Lincoln offers three tables (3, 4, and 5)
which show the correspondences between macrocosm and microcosm, with alloforms in
Germanic, Indo-Iranian, Greek, Latin, Celtic, and Slavic versions of what is basically the
same Proto-Indo-European myth. Clearly, the Chinese myth of P'an-ku is an adaptation of
the Indo-European myth, even down to many telling details that are identical: the cosmic
man's flesh becomes the earth, his hair becomes plants, his breath the wind, and so
forth. 51
It is remotely conceivable that the name P'an-ku (approximate Han period
pronunciation *ban-kah) constitutes a distant phonological transformation of the name
Puru~a or some cognate thereof. Whatever its source, once the sinographic transcription
for P'an-ku became fIxed, it was almost inevitable that it would be invoked in association
with P'an-hu (approximate Han period pronunciation *ban-gah)~52 As Wen Vi-to has
impressively shown,53 the string of sinographically generated mythic (mis)identifications
can be extended almost indefinitely: plan-ku II plan-hu II P'ao-hu{85} (=hu-lu) II Pao
hsi {86} =P'ao-hsi{87} =Mi[properly Fu]-hsi{88} =Fu-hsi{89}, who -- if we submit to
the dangerous seduction of taking the sinographs at their face value -- was thus not only the
very first legendary emperor of China, but also the first sacrificial dog-man. That way,
however, lies true chaos -- in more senses than one -- so we had best not pursue it any
further.
The irony of this sort of misidentification is that the names P'an-ku and plan-hu
were both undoubtedly transcriptions of foreign (non-Sinitic) words and that the myths to
which the names refer were originally totally separate and unrelated. All that has led to the
partial fusion of the two myths is the similarity of their sinographic transcriptions, the fact
that the former is cosmogonic and anthropogonic while the latter is anthropogonic,54 and
the coincidence that one was almost certainly derived by the Hans from southwestern or
northwestern peoples while the other was quite likely applied by the Hans to southern and
southwestern peoples.

Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
CYNANTHROPOMORPIllZATION
The ascription of canine attributes to humans from groups other than one's own is a
convenient way to classify and partially dehumanize them. The people whom one
cynanthropomorphizes are still human beings, but they are human beings of a ve~ peculiar
sort; they are dog-humans.
The initial Chinese experiments in cynanthropomorphization were directed toward
neighbors living to the north and the west. The Dog Jung are only the most obvious and
best-known example, but the same tendency is reflected 'in the characters which the Chinese
used to transcribe the names of people such as the Ti, the Yun, and the Hsun{90} (three
"barbarian" tribes living in the north during ancient times). It is significant that the earliest
ascription of caninity to peripheral peoples was to groups located to the north and west of
the Chinese heartland. Along with the other evidence for dog imagery cited elsewhere in
this paper, this reinforces the notion that the Chinese picked up the idea of cynanthropy and
canine totemism from the northern and western peoples themselves. This affection for and
attachment to dogs is easily comprehensible for peoples to whom these animals were so
important in daily life and after death (see section entitled "Human Beings and Dogs: Deep
Linkages" below).
For the Chinese, however, the dog during the last two millennia and more has
represented something altogether different. Far from being "man's best friend," the dog,
according to proverbial Chinese wisdom, was fawning, worthless, craven, foolish, or
vicious -- the antithesis of the kind, gentle, resourceful, courageous, watchful, loyal, and
helpful companion of the Indo-Europeans and other largely nomadic peoples who occupied
Central Asia in antiquity. Thus, once the Chinese adopted the notion that human beings
could be cynanthropomorphized, they invoked it according to their own propensities.
Shifting their focus from the north and the west whence the original dog imagery derived,
they applied it to numerous peoples who lived in the south.
In terms of the expansion of the Han people from their Yellow River homeland
south of the Yangtze, it is understandable that this surge of cynanthropy would take place
precisely when and where it did, since it was just around the end of the Han Dynasty when
the migration of northern peoples to the south vastly increased its tempo. From 280 to 464
CE, the increase in the Han-Chinese registered population south of the Yangtze was more
than five-fold. The causes of these massive and prolonged migrations were numerous and
included constant wars and frequent famines. In the year 310, a terrible drought-induced
famine led to the ironically named Panic of Yung-chia{91} ("Eternal Felicity") in which
17



Victor H. Mair, "Canine ConundrumsII
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
Tatar invaders pushed starving Han-Chinese masses southward. The result was that 60-70
percent of the Han-Chinese population of the central provinces crossed the Yangtze in the
wake of that monumental panic.55
Given these enormous demographic movements from the north, it is not at all
surprising that the Han people -- who were coming into contact with non-Han groups south
of the Yangtze on a large scale for the first time -- would devise names and narratives to
account for the unfamiliar peoples and customs that they encountered. It was in this very
atmosphere of cultural shock and alientation that the P'an-bu myth first surfaces and is
elaborated. As the Han infiltrated the south, often pushing the indigenes out of the fertile
flatland up into the mountains and a state of montagnardism,56 they transcribed their
names, usually with characters either having a "bug / insect / worm-serpent" radical or a
"dog" radical. Among the southern peoples whose names were transcribed with characters
having a dog radical were the Kuo-Io (a tribe spread over Yunnan, Kweichow, and
Szechwan), the Yao (in Kwangsi, Kwangtong, Hunan, Yunnan, etc.), the Mu or Mu-yao
(in Kwangtong), the Liao (in various parts of the southwest), the T'ung{92} (in
Kwangtung and Kwangsi), and so forth. The inclusion of dog radicals in the characters
used to transcribe the names of neighboring peoples was certainly intended to stigmatize
them as inferior, since the vast majority of all characters in the Chinese script that have dog
radicals convey characteristics of the following sort: mercilessness, heartlessness, cruelty,
cunning, craftiness, viciousness, irascibility, gluttony, wildness, madness, narrow
mindedness, impudence, ferocity, wickedness, and so forth.
SHEN OR SHIH: MYTH OR HISTORY?
Kan Pao wanted to preserve for posterity what Ssu-ma Ch'ien{93}, author of
Record of the Scribe, and the other historians missed. In his Preface to Searching for the
Supernatural, he compares his work to that of historical research and declares that "the
spirit world is not a lie." {94}57 It would appear that Kan Pao's wish was granted: shen
(shen-hua [tlmyth"]) became shih (li-shih{95} ["history"]). Judging from the evolution of
the plan-hu story, it would seem that most Chinese scholars did not make a sharp
distinction between myth and history. Indeed, myth (insofar as it survived in its often
fragmented condition) was generally subsumed under history or geography.
Let us examine the process whereby myth becomes history. The "Man chuan{96}
[Biography of the Marn]" in the Wei shu{97} [History of the Northern Wei] of Wei
Shou{98}, scroll 101 (KM ed., p. 2126c),58 begins with the following sentence: tiThe
different types of Marn are in all likelihood the descendants of plan-hu. Their origins are
18



Victor H. Mair, tlCanine Conundrumstl
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
.'.,..... . . '
ancient. "{99 } The key word in this fortnulati,on is kai{100}, which I have translated as
"are in all likelihood.II Some may wish to render kai simply as "are," but it is not merely an
equational or copulative verb. Instead, it usually implies a sense of conjecture or surmise
and can even evince skepticism or the nuance of a rhetorical interrogative.59 Thus, while
the author of this passage endorses and perpetuates the notion that the Marn were
descended from a dog-ancestor, he expresses a degree of reservation through his use of the
word kai.
In the next century, Wei Shou's refrain (without its slight skepticism) is taken up
by a bevy of historians and becomes a veritably de riguer introduction to any discussion of
southern peoples. Hence, in the Chou shut 101} [History ofthe Northern Chou], scroll 49
(KM ed., p. 2338c), we read, "The Marn are the descendants of P'an-hu."{ 102} The Pei
shih {I03} [History of the Northern Dynasties], scroll 95 (KM ed., p. 3035d), begins its
account of the Mam exactly as did Wei Shou. And, in the Sui shu{104} [History of the
Sui], scroll 31 (KM ed., p. 244la), we find, "The various Marn ...are descendants of
P'an-hu." {lOS}
It should be noted that the unrestrained elaboration of the plan-hu myth did not go
unchallenged. The eminent historiographer, Liu Chih-chi{ l06} (641-721), in his Shih
(ung{ 107} [Comprehending History], made the following rather harsh comments:
Fan Yeh selected materials widely from numerous books and crafted them into an
account of the Han. When we look at what he has adopted, it is quite a remarkable
achievement. However, as for his chapter on occultism (fang-shu {108}) and his
biography of the various "barbarians" (man-yi{ I09}), he has made records of such figures
as Wang Ch'iao.60 Tso Tz'u.61 Lin Chtin{ lID} ("Lord of the Granarylt),62 and P'an-hu.
His words are absurd and the content is preposterous. One may say that these chapters are
blemishes in a beautiful nephrite, flaws in a fine jade. Alas, there is nothing about these
chapters that we can affmn.63
Elsewhere, Liu censures authors who repeat such ridiculous stories as the descent of the
Southern Mam from P'an-bu and the building of a bridge made of turtles by the Koreans,
stories -- according to Liu -- which may be found in almost every book throughout the
ages. What is more, these authors not only are ignorant of the original composition of such
unlikely tales, they embellish and perpetuate them.64
Liu Chih-chi's negative views were enthusiastically seconded by the celebrated
encyclopedist, Tu Yu{ Ill} (735-812):
19



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
Fan Yeh's biographies of the "barbarians" (Mam-Yi) in the History 0/ the Later
Han are aU weird and the accounts of the "barbarians" all around (ssu-yi{1l2}) by others
are also mostly of this sort. Without making clear their origins, they simply follow
along and discuss them. It has been said that Kao-hsin sought to enlist the services of
someone who could bring him the head of the general (chiang-chan {113}) of the Dog
lung and that he would reward the one who did so with a thousand yi{ 114} of gold, a fief
of ten thousand households, and his daughter for a wife.
Note ofTu Yu: Before the Chou Dynasty, gold was measured in chin{115}
while in the Ch'in there were twenty ounces per yi. Before the three dynasties of the
Hsia, Shang, and Chou, it was land that was divided up, while after the Ch'in and Han~
division was made to individuals. Furthermore, it was only at the end of the Chou that
the position of chiang-chun65 was established and the surname Wu{ 116} properly existed
only after the naming of clans by the Chou. Yet Fan Yeh believed that all of these
things could be dated to the time of Kao-hsin. This is being much too imprecise!
Furthermore, according to the Sung shih{1l7} [History o/the Liu Sung], after Fan Yeh
was arrested [on charges of treason], he wrote to his nieces and nephews from jail,
explaining himself with these words: "The writing style of my pieces on the six
'Barbarians' (Liu-yi {118}) is quite unrestrained. Truly, they are rare among all the works
under heaven! Those among them that hit the mark are invariably not inferior to Chia
Yi's{ 119} (201-169 BCE) 'Kuo Ch'in lun{ 120} [Disquisition on the Faults of Ch'in].' If
I were to compare myself with Pan Ku{ 121} (32-92 CE, main author of Han shu{ 122}
[History o/the Han)), I really wouldn't be ashamed.,,66
Note ofTu Yu: When Pan Ku and Chia Yi recounted affairs, did they ever speak
of such strange things? When he makes as many blunders as this, how can Fan Yeh
claim not to be inferior to Chia Yi and not to be ashamed in comparison with Pan
Ku?!67
Although a minority dissenting opinion continued to be voiced in such careful and
critical works as Wang Hsien-ch'ien's{ 123} (1842-1918) Hou-Han-shu chi-chieh{ 124}
{Collected Explanations o/the History of the Later Han 1,68 most commentators have not
only automatically repeated the P'an-hu myth as history, they have embellished it and
interwoven it with other myths that were originally unrelated. If myth were simply
recognized as myth, this would not pose a problem. The difficulty arises when such myths
and fantasies work their way into history.
For China, "mythology" is a modem, Western epistemological category. There is
now a Sinitic term, shen-hua {125}, that is recognized as functionally equivalent to
20



Victor H. Mair. "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
"mythology". However, like the words for "philosophy" (che-hsueh{ 126}, Japanese
tetsugaku), "religion" (tsung-chiao{ 127}, Japanese shiikyo), "literature" (wen
hsiieh{ 128}, Japanese bungaku), and so many other Western intellectual categories, it was
probably transferred to Chinese from Japanese (shinwa) as a convenient neologism. In
antiquity, China certainly had gods and spirits aplenty, but no "myth" (shen-hua ["god I
spirit-talk"]) as such. Still less did it have "mythology" (shen-hua-hsiieh{ 129} ["study I
learning about gods I spirit"]).69
While the existence of myth(ology) in ancient China is problematic for various
reasons, it is hardly to be doubted that it possessed the equivalents of both "history" and
"historiography". There were certainly an abundance of many notable shih{ 130}
("chronicles, annals" and the "scribes"70 who wrote them). And ancient China surely was
concerned with history in the sense of "the branch of knowledge dealing with past
events,,,71 which is not a neologism.72 Ancient Chinese also had "history" in the sense of
"a continuous, systematic narrative of past events as relating to a particular people, country,
period, person, etc., usually written as a chronological account; chronicle.,,73 That ancient
China amply possessed "history" in this latter sense is born out both by praxis and by the
vast amount of extant written materials which can be so characterized.74
After this brief excursus on mythology and history, we may aver that the ancient
Chinese were relatively weak in the former and strong in the latter. Consequently, the
former was liable to be subsumed or consumed by the latter. Such was the case with P'an
hu, who began as deified totem but ended up as reified datum. In a riot of reverse
euhemerization, both P'an-ku and P'an-hu come to be accepted as real people who once
lived and walked, not merely as mythical deities. We have seen how P'an-hu is written
into the standard histories without the slightest reservation or qualification, whereas Giles
even goes so far as to award P'an-ku a place in his Biographical Dictionary (no. 1607, pp.
613-614). Several individuals even adopted the syllable P'an as their own surname,75
whether from P'an-ku or from P'an-hu remaining a moot point. This is all part of a
process that I would characterize in Literary Sinitic as chung shih ch'ing shen{131} ("value
scribes, despise spirits") or, in Mandarin, chung-shih ii-shih ch'ing-shih shen-hua{ 132}
("take history seriously, but make light of myth"). It may well be that this pervasive
attitude among the literati was one of the main causes of the much-lamented decimation and
distortion of Chinese myths.
HUMAN BEINGS AND DOGS: DEEP LINKAGES
21



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
As one would expect, the daughter languages of the Indo-European family share a
common word for "dog." From Proto-Indo-Europea.t) *kwon- are derived Greek kuon,
Latin canis, Italian cane, French chien, Spanish can (mostly obsolete in favor of perro,
which is of obscure origin), Portuguese cao, Rumanian cline, Tocharian A ku (oblique
kon), Irish cu, Welsh ci, Breton ki, German, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish hund
(from the dentally enlarged, suffixed zero-grade form *kw!l-to- in Germanic *hundaz),
Yiddish hunt, Dutch hond, English "hound", Sanskrit svan- (the k > s sound change is
regular in satem languages), Avestan span-, Lithuanian Suo, Lettie suns, Russian sobaka,
and Armenian lun.76 What is surprising, however, is that the ancient word for "dog" is
cognate in many languages reaching far beyond Indo-European. This has been
conclusively demonstrated, first by Illich-Svitich77 and recently by Bornhard.78 Illich
Svitich would extend the meaning of the earliest known root of the word to include the
notion of "wolf' as well as that of "dog," but Bombard is more cautious and restricts the
meaning to "dog" alone. A few examples of the languages they cite are Dangla kanya and
Jegu kany- from East Chadic, Mogogodo kwehen and Fyer kweelJ from West Chadic,
Ka[f]fa and Mocha kunano, Ome[to] kana, kanaa, Dime keenu and Mao kano from
Omotic, and Guanche cuna from Berber. Indeed, as I shall momentarily point out, even
the Sinitic word for "dog" is essentially the same as the common word for that animal in
most Indo-European languages. How can we account for this identity of usage in such a
vast variety of languages? There are two possible, credible explanations: 1. all of the
languages which share the same word for "dog" were derived from a single parent
language; 2. the cornmon word for "dog" spread with the domestication of the animal.79 I
believe that the correct explanation for this remarkable phenomenon is a combination of the
two possibilities.
Dogs were first domesticated from wolves in Iraq and Palestine around 12,000
years ago80 and dog bones have been found in association with the earliest known Indo
European settlements (north of the Black Sea) around 4500 BCE. European peoples were
well disposed toward and relied upon dogs already by the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic
period (in Europe c. 9000-6000 BeE) which is characterized by the appearance of the dog
as the frrst domesticated animal, of the bow and arrow, and of pottery. "The burial of dogs
in Mesolithic cemeteries, generally of animals like German shepherd dogs, indicates that
these had been domesticated and were held in much esteem." The treatment of dogs at
Skateholm (southern tip of Sweden) was unusally lavish. "Certain dogs have been found
buried individually and with very rich grave goods, such as antlers and flint blades,
positioned as if the dog had been a human. ,,81 Thus we see that dogs were valuable to the

Old Europeans already before the Neolithic and before the rise of Indo-European
languages.
Given the great affection of the prehistoric Indo-Europeans for dogs and their
reliance upon them for hunting and herding, it is not surprising that some Central Asian
nomads would have adopted this animal as a tribal totem. Indeed, the existence of
lycanthropy (wolfmanism) among certain Central Asian peoples would seem to indicate that
esteem for this animal had developed even before it was fully domesticated.
These archeologically determined time-depths are significant in helping us to
understand the origin and spread of both the word for dog and the domesticated dog itself.
First of all, we should note that the hypothetical root for "dog", viz. *k[hJw n or
*k[hjwan, has not been securely established as genetically pertinent to all of the families
normally placed within the Nostratic macrofamily; it is germane only in Indo-European and
Afro-Asiatic, but not in Kartvelian, Uralic, Dravidian, and "Altaic".82 In Afro-Asiatic,
furthermore, the common hypothetical root for "dog" is firmly established only in the
Hamitic branch, but not in the Semitic branch.83 This affords an approximate idea of the
time-depth at which the common word for domesticated dog (*k[hjw nor *k[h]wan) arose
and was shared by speakers of the languages enumerated just above: closer to 6000 BCE
than to 10,000 BCE, but before 4000 BCE by which time Indo-European had established
itself as an independent family.
For reasons which are too complex to go into here, I do not accept Sinitic as part of
the Nostratic superfamily.84 Therefore, the words for domesticated dog in Sinitic, viz.
ch'uan{ 133} (approximate Old Sinitic pronunciation *khiwan) and kou{ 134} (approximate
Early Middle Sinitic pronunciation *~u), must have been borrowings. I view ch'iian
(*khiwCln) as the primary (early) borrowing and kou (*kdu) as a secondary (late)
borrowing, probably from Tocharian. Korean gae is most likely traceable to similar roots.
The archeological evidence for domesticated dogs matches well with the linguistic
evidence just cited. At the Pan-p'o neolithic village (beginning c. 5000) dogs were buried
under the posts and elsewhere around the foundations of dwellings, although domesticated
dogs were probably already present in North China approximately a thousand years before
that time and in Central China (between Hang-chou Bay and the estuary of the Yangtze)
slightly later.85 By the time of the Shang Dynasty (roughly 18th c.-12th c. BCE), dogs
were being extensively sacrificed and interred in royal burials along with oxen, sheep,
horses, and human victims.86
It was with the Indo-Europeans, however, that the dog seems to have taken on
especial importance in society. There can be no doubt that dogs played an important role in
the Indo-European community from its very beginning and that the word for "dog"
23



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums II
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
(*kwon- ) was part of the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary.8? At Sredny
Stog, in the very heart of the Pontic-Caspian homeland, dogs were buried together with
horses in graves88 (as in Shang tombs at An-yang) and were also sometimes found buried
under the posts of houses or around the foundations as at Pan-p'o.
McCone argues that we have sufficient evidence to prove Indo-European age
grades with the youngest group of military age forming war-bands who assumed dog or
wolf totems, dress, etc. They lived off the land by raiding and constitute the shock troops
of Indo-European warfare (something like Cheyenne dog-soldiers). It is not altogether
clear how this would have worked with respect to pastoral nomads, but it is likely that they
formed dog-related sets or some type of hound sodalities.89
DOGS AND liTHE OTHER"
In a brilliant book entitled Myths ofthe Dog-Man, David Gordon White has shown
that three different cultures (European, Indian and Chinese) share the same cynantbropic
image of Otherness, "a phenomenon that could be explained by some sort of Jungian, or
even Eliadean, assumption of universality," as pointed out by Wendy Doniger in her
"Foreword" to his book. The bizarre thought that the Other is a dog might simply also be
ascribed to pure chance. Yet, through the most meticulous and detailed scholarship, White
has gone on to demonstrate that these three cultures refract, in a negative
inversion, the mythological self-image of one, single, actual culture that
existed on the border of all rhree (a phenomenon that can be explained
through the more accessible assumptions of history and anthropology). He
argues for a central source for all three sets of myths, in Central Asia.90
Chapters 6.3, 7, and 8 of Myths of the Dog-Man deal with the various Chinese
sources for cynanthropic myths about peripheral peoples. These sources reveal a tangled
web of indigenous totemic myths, Chinese elaborations of these myths, and the borrowing
back of the reworked myths by different groups of autochthons. In some cases, the P'an
hu myth as refracted by the Chinese is further reworked by the indigenes, often for an
implicit political purpose. A good example of this process is the subtle manipulation of the
P'an-hu myth by the Yao, who emerged into history only in the eleventh century, against
the Marn whom they gradually displaced.91
White has pointed out the prevalence, in a wide spectrum of Indo-European
mythologies, of a pair of canine psychopomps (conductors of souls to the other world) and
24
'J

hellhound guards of the infernal gates all bearing similar names and functions. 92 As such,
dogs are seen as liminal creatures who are capable of transmuting back and forth from one
one realm to another. White has also called our attention to the universal identification of
the star Sirius with a celestial dog-star responsible for the burning heat of the dog days
throughout the northern hemisphere.93 Furthermore, the dog days also have funerary
associations in many traditions and are identified with the opening of the gates of the
infernal regions and the temporary release of the dead into the world of the living.
In China, the dog days are calledfu-t'ien{ 135} or san-fu/-t'ien}{ 136}. These are
the three ten-day periods of the hot season.94 They are roughly equivalent to the period
from the middle of July to the latter part of August.95 We should note that, in Roman
times, the six or eight hottest weeks of summer (usually falling in July, August, and early
September) were known colloquially as dies caniculares ("days of the dog"). This usage
originated with the Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians. The main reason the dog days were
called such (aside from the empathy of sweltering humans with furry, tongue-hanging':'out
canines suffering under the blistering sun) was because it was thought that the dog star
Sirius added its heat to that of the sun during this period (roughly July 3-August 11 as
reckoned astronomically [when Sirius' rise coincides with that of the sun]). Sirius, located
in the constellation Canis Major ("Bigger Dog"), is the most brilliant star in the sky. Its
Latin name derives from Greek Seirios, which means "burning". It is also called the Dog
Star, Sothis, from Egyptian spdt{ 137}.96
The realized form of the Egyptian word is Septit.97 The rising of §~tt1s (i.e.,
Septit) marked the beginning of the Egyptian year. Why was the heliacal rising of Sirius so
important to the Egyptians that they marked the beginning of their New Year with its
occurrence?98 The most straightforward answer is that it coincided with the rising of the
Nile River around July 19 (of the Julian calendar) each year. Around that time, Sirius was
observed in the sky shortly before sunrise, after having been invisible for a prolonged
period. The proper coordination of agricultural activities' depended on "reading" Sirius
accurately.
It is most likely not merely a coincidence that the Chinese, already from at least the
time of the "Chiu ko{ 138} (Nine Songs)" (early third century BCE?) in the Ch'u
tz'u{ 139} [Elegies ofthe South}, referred to this very same star as the Wolf (Canis lupus)
of Heaven (T'ien-Iang{ 140} ).99 There is, however, an even closer connection between
the canicular days of the West and thefu-t'ien or san-fu-t'ien of China. Namely,fu{ 141}
means "to prostrate, yield; hide, lie in ambush"; these are all actions typical of dogs. The
caninity of fu is evident in the visual form of the graph used to write the word. The
character forJu is of the hui-yi{ 142} ("combined meaning") type; it consists of a man on
25

Sino·Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
the left and a dog on the right, neither of which is a phonophore. Fu in the sense of
"period of extremely hot days" was first use~ in the "Ch'in pen-chi{ 143} [Basic Annals of
Ch'in]" of the Shih chi (Records of the Scribe), completed c. 90 BCE under the second
year of Duke Te (676 BCE).
There is a great deal of archeological evidence connecting western Yunnan to the
steppes where Indo-European-speaking nomads were already present during the Neolithic
and Bronze Age. 100 It would have been natural for dog imagery, dog totems, and dog
myths to enter southwest China along these routes. It is even possible that the Indo
European word (or cognate from another Nostratic language) for "domesticated dog"
entered Tibeto-Burman languages following the same paths.
The reconstruction of the Proto--Bunnish word for "dog" is roughly *khwei2, that
for Proto-Lolo-Burmese is roughly *kW iy2, and the Proto-Loloish for dog is *kwe2 .101
These reconstructions conform to the word for dog in most Tibeto-Burman languages of
southwest China and the Himalayan region. 102 Exceptionally, however, the Common
Lahu word for dog is hpui. The Lahu word superficially appears to have nothing to do
with *kwe2, but the shift from a labiovelar to an (aspirated) labial is a regular reflex which
occurs in at least three other instances in Lahu l03 and is also met with in Greek (e.g.,
hippo II Proto-lndo-European *ekwo ["horse"]; -poiesis ["poetry"] II Proto-Indo-European
*kwei- ["pile up, build, make]). Burmese, interestingly, has what appears to be essentially
a phonologically intermediary fonn, hkwei. 104 Loloish consists of a Northern branch (Yi
or Lolo), a Central branch (Labu and Lisu), and a Southern branch (mBisu, Phunoi, Mpi,
Akha). The cladistics of Lahu (working from the bottom upward) are as follows: Lahu>
Akha cluster> Southern Lolo subgroup> Loloic group> Burmese-Lolo subbranch>
Burmese-Moso branch> Burmic subgroup> Tibeto-Burman group> Tibeto-Karen branch
> Sin~-Tibetan family (the latter still somewhat hypothetical).105
It is conceivable that the peculiar phonological configuration of the Lahu word for
"dog" might have been the source of the name Plan-hu. Bisyllabification is a typical Sinitic
maneuver for coping with unfamiliar consonant clusters, while nasalization is equally
common in Chinese loan words. The distribution of the Lahu along the routes by which
the domesticated dog, the word for dog, and canine imagery most likely entered southwest
China would also appear to reinforce such a speculation (see maps). I am inclined,
however, to reject it, because the vowel qualities of P'an-hu and hpui (or ph+, phllL, phuy -
the Lahu word for "dog") do not match very well. Furthennore, the earliest version of the
plan-hu myth which provides linguistically significant data (that of Fan Yeh in the History
of the Later Han) would seem to indicate that it was first identified with Austroasiatic
speaking Mon rather than Tibeto-Burman-speaking Lahu. Finally, the Lahu were by no

Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
means fond of dogs. Quite the contrary, of the more than three dozen expressions that
include the word "dog" (Ph~ given by Matisoffin his hefty Dictionary ojLahu,106 all but
a few neutral tenns are vile in nature and the largest proportion have to do with copulation
or excrement. A people who harbors such thoroughly negative attitudes about dogs would
not be apt to consider themselves the descendants of a dog-ancestor.
Eberhard holds that the P'an-hu myth occurred only among Yao peoples or their
relatives. 107 Neither the linguistic nor the historical evidence supports such a view. The
P'an-hu myth is ascribed to a wide variety of southern peoples, among them the Man, Pa,
Miao (Le., Hmong), Yao, T'ung{144}, She, and other non-Han groups living south of the
Yangtze. The linguistic affIliation of these groups is enonnously complicated. Obviously,
the groups who are said to believe in the P'an-hu myth do not all belong to a single
language family. Indeed, some of the groups are themselves composed of speakers from
different language families. For example, a little less than half of the Yao actually speak
Yao, an Austric language, while approximately one third speak a variety of Miao (Hmong),
another Austric language, about one percent speak a Tai language known as Lakya, about
11 percent speak an unusual variety of Sinitic, and the remainder presumably speak still
other languages. 108
What is even less clear than the linguistic affinities of those who are said to believe
in the P'an-hu myth is the question of ascription versus subscription. Namely, did the
southern, non-Han peoples initiate, shape, and subscribe to the P'an-hu myth themselves?
Or was the myth created, elaborated, and ascribed to the southern peoples by the Han
Chinese? I believe that the totality of the. evidence tilts toward the preponderance of
ascription over SUbscription, although both factors were operative. The P'an-hu myth,
even supposing that it had its ultimate origins among the Marn peoples themselves (which
is highly doubtful, if not impossible, in light of the overall evidence adduced above),
...is one which borrows heavily from Chinese "barbarian genres" in the
Chinese (re-)telling of it. ...[H]owever, there is much of the barbarian in
China's self-identity, in spite of the voluminous evidence that Chinese
tradition musters to the contrary. 109
In ascribing caninity to the southerners and then enveloping them within its empire, China
has absorbed the myths and ethos that go along with the assumptions about their dog
nature.
CONCLUSION
27



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
The variants of the P'an-hu myth that have come down to us have all been
substantially shaped by Han conceptions of the Other. There is not a single extant P'an-hu
myth that can be demonstrated to reflect accurately the ethos of any of the southern peoples
themselves. Individually and as a fragmentary corpus, the P'an-hu myth variants reported
in Chinese sources from the late Eastern Han Dynasty through the end of the Ch'ing period
are confused and contradictory. Furthermore, they are not confirmed by independent
ethnographic observation. All of this is in stark contrast to the bottle-gourd myths which
have been transmitted orally and in writing among the southern peoples for centuries.
What is more, elements of the bottle gourd myths have been actively adopted by the Han
peoples as part of their own world-view. Even if there may originally have been a germ of
self-identity in the P'an-hu myth, it has come down to us primarily in Sinitic texts from the
Han period on. Fundamentally, the P'an-hu myth has been adumbrated within Han culture
as a way of categorizing a disparate body of alien neighbors.
What we find in the Chinese material are at least two levels of "indigenous
barbarian" traditions refracted through the lens of this tradition's particular
interpretive apparatus. In this way, central Asian and southern Chinese
ancestry myths are often transformed into cosmogonic myths or mythic
representations of various economic relationships between vassal and
empire. IIO
Perhaps eve~ more revealing about the nature of Han mythology, legend, and
folklore concerning both Self and Other than its refractive and ascriptive qualities is the
extent to which it is script-driven. The semantically potent sinographic script constantly
generates narratives that originally have as their primary purpose the justification of folk
etymologies that are essentially artifacts of transcription. In the fIrst place, the name plan
hu does not have the look of a native Sinitic name. Secondly, P'an-hu is a myth about
non-Han people, so it is probable that its hero would have a non-Sinitic name. Third, there
are at least five different sinographic forms of the name P'an-hu, thus it is likely that they
are variant orthographic transcriptions of a non-Sinitic word. Once the name plan-hu was
written down in characters, literate Chinese were ineluctably tempted to invent a narrative to
explain the meaning of the transcription. It does not matter that the choice of characters
used to write the name P'an-hu was almost certainly originally determined primarily by
phonological considerations and thus essentially meaningless in terms of semantic content.

Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
Kan Pao, being a literatus, succumbed to the temptation. Thus he begins his
account of the origins of the Mam with the old woman in the palace having an earache. To
recapitulate, an object the size of a cocoon is removed from her ear and placed in a gourd
(hu), then covered with a basin (p'an). The little lump soon grows into a dog, thus
explaining not only the origins of the dog-ancestor plan-hu, but ultimately of his
descendants -- the Marn -- as well. As a matter of fact, Kan Pao did not himself invent this
false-etymologically driven narrative, for we find it in a note of the early T'ang
commentator, Li Hsien{ 145}, where it is identified as deriving from the Wei-Iueh{ 146}
[Historical Sketch ofthe Wei]. The Historical Sketch ofthe Wei was an account of the Wei
Dynasty, one of the Three Kingdoms (San-kuo{ 147}) that succeeded the Eastern Han
Dynasty, written by Yii Huan{148} around the middle of the third century.111 Li Hsien's
note citing the now-lost Historical Sketch of the Wei version of plan-huts supernatural
origin is found in, of all places, the beginning of his commentary to the "Biography of the
Southern Marn" in the History of the Later Han. It would appear that the much maligned
Fan Yeh passed over this fantastic birth story, which was available to him both in Yii
Huan's Historical Sketch of the Wei and in Kan Pao's Record of Searching for the
Supernatural, perhaps because he found it too unbelievable. Instead, he plunges directly
into the story without regard for the god's origins, concentrating instead on plan-hu as the
ancestor of the Southern Marn. This leaves Fan Yeh's biography of the Southern Marn
truncated at the top: he simply begins by telling about the troubles the emperor was having
with the Dog lung and the fact that a multicolored domesticated dog named P'an-hu was
living in his palace. Unlike Yii Huan or Kan Pao, Fan Yeh does not tell us how such a
miraculous dog came into being. While Fan Yeh may have been striving to preserve a
shred of historical credibility for his biography of the Southern Marn by removing its most
patently fatuous component, his excision of P'an-hu's birth story renders his account both
unsatisfying and unsatisfactory. If Fan Yeh could accept the canine ancestry of the
Southern Marn as historically reliable and thus worthy of inclusion in the official History
of the Later Han, then it behooved him to explain the pedigree of P'an-hu. It would
appear, however, that he consciously avoided that subject, especially since it was
conspicuously present in the accounts of both Yii Huan and Kan Pao.
A more believable scenario for the early filiation of the story may be the following:
1. Ying Shao (or a contemporary) writes down the plan-hu story, sans any explanation of
plan-huls own origins, around the end of the second century; 2. Yii Huan finds Ying
Shao's account unsatisfactory because it fails to explain where plan-hu came from, so he
adds the pseudoetymologically inspired tale of the miraculous dog's birth at the beginning;
3. Kan Pao embellishes Yii Huan's account; 4. Fan Yeh adopts the original myth as
29



Victor H. Mair. "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November. 1998)
presented by Ying Shao. In any event, the basic rationale of the Historical Sketch of the
Wei story is to explain the most common orthographic form of the name. The openings of
the plan-hu myth variants as narrated by Yii Huan and by Kan Pao are excellent examples
of the generative power of the morphosyllabic Chinese script in folklore, popular narrative,
myth, and legend. All cultures have far-fetched stories for justifying false etymologies, but
Chinese culture is inundated with them because of the semantically robust genius of its
script.
One of the most enduring lessons that may be learned from this preliminary
investigation is the extent to which the sinographic script can shape the stories that it
records. P'an-hu (the dog-man) originally had nothing to do with plan-ku (tbe cosmic
man), but because of the 'partial resemblance of their sinographic transcriptions, they have
often been held by Chinese scholars to be a single myth. Similarly, P'an-bu (the dog-man)
and hu-Iu (the bottle gourd) had very different origins, yet once again, because of the
semantic interference (P'an-hu ="plate-gourd") of the sinographic script when it is used
for transcriptions of foreign words into Sinitic languages, they were frequently forced into
a single mythic framework. Even such a distinguished scholar as Schafer112 uncritically
follows in the path of those who conflate the plan-hu and bottle gourd myths into a single,
grand supermyth which simultaneously attempts to account for all of their separate,
constituent elements. The research of Wen Yi-to on Fu-hsi and the annotations of Yuan
Klo on the Classic o/the Mountains and Seas reveal how seriously jumbled P'an-hu, P'an
ku, King plan (plan Wang{149}), the hu-Iu ("bottle gourd"), and a host of other mythic
manifestations have become. One gains the same impression from the copious citations of
pre-modem texts dating back to the Han period and the commentary upon them of Liu
Chleng-huai who declares bafflingly that P'an-ku and plan-hu are "two become one, one
become two" (erh erh yi te, yi erh erh le{ IS0}))13 If the situation is so confused'in the
scholarly literature, it is even more confounded in legend. 114
If we really want to understand the development of Chinese history, civilization,
and culture, we have to start with philology so that we can get behind the characters to the
words and the ideas. But that is not to assert that philology is where we should end our
investigations. After diligently carrying out the necessary philological spadework, we must
utilize every interpretive device at our disposal. Nor should we deceive ourselves into
believing that there can ever be an end to our research. Therefore, my conclusion is an
admission that the investigation of the plan-hu / P'an-ku / hu-Iu / hun-t'un{ 151} / ...
mythic supercomplex, at least for me, has just begun.

NOTES
I wish to acknowledge the inspiration and information I have received from the
following sources: 1. an unpublished paper by Leo K. Shin entitled "Conceptualizing the
Non-Han in South China during the Ming" which was prepared for the 1995 Annual
Meeting of the Association for Asian Studies; 2. an unpublished paper by Sara Davis on
Yunnan as a zone of contact between Han and non-Han cultures; and 3. the illuminating
work of Laura Hostetler, Susan Blum, and other young scholars who have directed our
attention to the important question of ethnographic encounters in southwest China. I would
also like to take advantage of this opportunity to register my gratitude to Frank Proschan
for supplying me with offprints of three difficult-to-obtain articles concerning Southeast
Asian myths.
1. Since writing that article, two new references dealing with gourd myths in Southeast
Asia have come to my attention: Nguyen, "Deluge Legend" and Nathalang, "Tai Creation
Myths," p. 298.
2. Here and throughout this paper, I have altered the spelling of the name of the Man «
Marn) "barbarians" in translated titles or passages to ensure that there is no possibility of
confusion with the English word and to indicate that it is pronounced in the second tone of
Modem Standard Mandarin.
3. Translated by DeWoskin and Crump, Search o/the Supernatural, pp. 160-162 and cf.
Kao, Fantastic, pp. 79-81 for another complete translation by Michael Broschat. Kan
Pao's account is also partially translated by Birrell in her Chinese Mythology, pp. 119-120.
Because her translation brings out certain nuances that are absent from the complete
translation of DeWoskin and Crump, it is worth citing- (changing plan Hu to P'an-hu and
Kao Hsin to Kao-hsin):
Kao-hsin had an old wife who lived in the royal palace. She developed an
earache. After some time the doctor cleared her ear out to cure her and he removed a knob
worm as big as a cocoon. After the wife had gone out, she put it in a gourd basket and
covered it with a plate. Soon the knob-worm changed into a dog and it had five-color
markings. So it was named plan-hu, Plate-Gourd, and she looked after it.
At the time the Jung-wu were powerful and successful and frequently invaded the
border region. So he [Kao-hsin] dispatched generals to attack and que)] the invasion but
31



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
they could not capture or defeat them [the invaders]. So [Kao-hsin] issued a proclamation
that if anyone in the world could capture the head of the commander in chief of the Jung
wu, he would be rewarded with a thousand catties of gold and would have the fiefdom of
ten thousand households, and he would have the hand of his own daughter in marriage.
Some time later, P'an-hu carried in his jaws a head he had captured and he carried it to the
tower of the royal palace. The king examined it, and it turned out to be the very head of
the commander of the lung-wu. What was to be done about it? His courtiers all said,
"Plate-Gourd is an animal, so he cannot have an official rank or a wife. He should not
have the reward, even though he deserves it." His youngest daughter heard them and
entreated the king, saying: "Your Majesty did promise me to him before the whole
world! Plate-Gourd came with the head in his jaws and saved your kingdom from disaster.
This was decreed by Heaven. How can it just be due to the wisdom and power of a dog?
The king must weigh his words carefully; the chief earls must attach importance to their
good faith. You cannot cancel an agreement that was pledged before the whole world just
because of a girl's body -- that would mean catastrophe for your kingdom. II The king
became alarmed and agreed with what she said. He ordered his youngest daughter to be a
dutiful wife to Plate-Gourd.
Plate-Gourd led the girl up South Mountain. The grass and trees were thick and
bushy and there was no trace of human footprints. Then the girl took her clothes off and
became bonded to him as his servant, wearing clothes that she made as best she could, and
she followed Plate-Gourd up the mountain.

5. For a fascinating hypothesis on the possible Indo-European antecedents of the Yellow
Emperor, see Chang, "Indo-European Vocabulary," pp. 35-36. This will be relevant for
many of the findings touched upon later in this paper. For a no-nonsense examination of
the textual sources concerning Kao-hsin and the Yellow Emperor, see Karlgren, "Legends
and Cults," pp. 206, 207, 211, 212-214, 218, 221, 222, 225, 226, 227, 228, 230, 233,
242, 243, 247, 255, 260, 265, 271, 274, 278, and 283-285.
There are no firm grounds for the actual existence (as historical personages per se)
of the Yellow Emperor, Kao-hsin, and the other pre-Shang rulers whose supposed
genealogy and stupendous feats have been sketched out in texts of the Warring States,
Ch'in-Han, and later periods. They are essentially mythical gods and legendary heroes
who evoke dim memories of the distant past. Consequently, they may reveal important
32



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
clues about the origins of Chinese civilization and the psyche of the Chinese people, but
they are not to be taken literally as building blocks for a foundation upon which to construct
a history of early China.
This has not prevented Chinese devotees and genealogists of the Yellow Emperor,
who consider him to be the "primal ancestor" of their nation, from concocting a complete
biography for him. According to this account, the Yellow Emperor was born in Shou
ch'iu (not far from Ch'ii-fu, the hometown of Confucius [N.B.]), Shantung Province; died
at Ching-shan, Honan; and was buried on the summit of Mount Ch'iao-shan (about a
kilometer from Huang-ling district town) in Shensi, where millions go to visit his
"remains." See Xiao, ed., China's Cultural Heritage, pp. 26-27.

7. Against all other available phonological evidence, a note in the History ofthe Later Han
asserts that this word should be read hang-t'u{ 152}. As we shall see when trying to
discover what non-Sinitic word it may reflect, the hang-t'u reading (which may have a
dialectical source), matches the available comparative evidence better than does the
customary yang-t'u{ 153} reading.

14. Even in Modem Standard Mandarin the two words differ in tone and in Old Sinitic their
pronunciations would have been much further apart. The luan which evolved into the
Sinitic transcription of the ethnonym Marn (as well as numerous other words written with
graphs sharing the same phonophore) and the luan meaning "chaotic" are totally separate
words deriving from unrelated etymons.

ChIen's assumption that they are possibly the same people as the Ch'iian-yi, K'un-yi, and
Ch'tian-jung{ 163} of Warring States period texts. The phonology of the initial syllables of
all three names is close enough to each other and to the reconstructed pronunciation of the
Ancient Sinitic word for "dog" (ch'iian) that they may well be variant transcriptions of the
same (totemic?) tribal ethnonym.

Regarding the P'an-ku business, the idea that creation comes from the body

(e.g., Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples [Chicago, 1965]) from his
work with the Wemale of Ceram. Jensen, who called such figures (e.g.,

Japanese counterparts [e.g., Uemochi, who is dismembered by Susano])
demas, suggested that they might be very widespread in cosmogonic myths,
and both Bruce Lincoln and Jaan Puhvellater followed this up regarding the
ancient Indo-European tradition (see Puhvel's Comparative Mythology
[Johns Hopkins, 1987). Indeed, it was Puhvel who first pointed out that
the killing of Remus fit the same pattern as found in the killing of Ymir (Rig
Veda 10.90), etc. (I allude to this matter in a long paper called "The
'Kingship in Heaven' Theme," in Puhvel, ed., Myth and Law among the

scattered parts of Europe, Asia, and Mrica naturally and spontaneously uttered the same
word when they fIrst saw a dog because of the innate nature of the dog and due to the
common neurolinguistic capabilities of humans, or that so many different peoples share the

same word for dog because names of animals are basically onomatopoeic. Such intuitive
explanations, which run counter to rational linguistic analysis, are not convincing. If they
were correct, then everyone in the world would use the same words for "dog," "cat,"
"horse," "bird," and every other animal. Since this is patently not the case, we are obliged
to seek for an explanation that better accords with the actual, historical development of
peoples and their languages.

86. Li, Anyang, pp. 106-108. Katheryn M. Linduff (personal communication of April 9,
1997) has generously provided much additional information indicating that dogs played an
important role in Late Neolithic, Chalcolithic, and Bronze Age society in China, at least
among the royal, aristocratic strata. In the Central Plain, dogs were sacrificially buried
both at Erh-Ii-t'ou and Cheng-chou. At Erh-Ii-tlou (K'ao-ku 1983.3: 210) dog bones are
found in what appears to be a Shang burial and one dog was buried in a lacquer coffin. In
another report, a dog was placed in a kiln-like structure (K'ao-ku 1953.3: 300). At Cheng
chou, dogs are found in several capacities: in waist pits -- as they are in Lung-shan in the
largest tombs -- and in pits with sacrificed human beings, all together 130 dogs in 8 pits set
out in rows over 17 gold pieces (10 large and 7 small) (K'ao-ku hsueh-pao 1957.1: 72).
At Yen-shih, dog bones were found under the gate of a site (K'ao-ku 1984.10: 873). The
evidence for sacrificial dog burials at An-yang (Shang period) is particularly rich. Different
types of dog sacrifices are reflected in sites outside of the Central Plain, but in places where
41



Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers. 87 (November, 1998)
contact was regular. For instance, in Lower Hsia-chia-tien (Inner Mongolia) sites dogs are
a regular part of burials, and in Yen-ch'ing County, Peking District, at the Shan-jung
cemeteries many dogs were sacrificed (Nan-sheng-en, MI0l, K'ao-ku hsueh-pao 1973.2:
27-39).
87. Mallory, Indo-Europeans, pp. 111, 113, 119, 187, 191, 198-199,203,214,220,
228, and 275. Melchert, "pm 'dog' in Hittite?", cites the term LUkuwa(n)- ("dog-man")
in Hittite, the oldest attested Indo-European language, where kuwa(n)- is almost certainly
related to Proto-Indo-European *Kwon- ("dog," cf. English "canine, hound"). Hsu and
Ward, Ancient Chinese Society, pp. 73-74, emphasize the privileged position of the dog in
Shang society. Among the functions of the dog they mention are its excellence for hunting,
smelling, military operations, and guarding houses. The "fondly-loved companions" were
often buried in a manner that is strikingly similar to that of the Indo-Europeans. This is in
contrast to the later attitude of Chinese toward dogs which is almost uniformly negative.
88. Anthony, "Shards," p. 37ab describes the Copper Age burial of a seven- or eight-year
old stallion near the village of Dereivka. At the edge of a settlement belonging to the Sredni
Stog culture (middle Dnieper, lower Don area) and dating to between 4200 and 3800 BCE,
the horse's hide, with its head and the bones of one foreleg attached, was ritually interred
along with the heads and pelts of two dogs. Aside from the unmistakable signs of bit wear
on the horse's premolar teeth, which would make it the earliest direct evidence of the
practice of horseback riding in the world (c. 4000 BCE, about 500 years before the wheel
was invented [apparently in the same general area inhabited by Indo-Europeans]), the
Dereivka stallion is noteworthy for the present discussion because of its close association
with domesticated dogs which were obviously highly valued. Similar ritual burials have
been found at Bronze Age sites from Denmark to the Tarim Basin associated with peoples
who were most likely Indo-Europeans. (Note: In a letter of September 9, 1998, David
Anthony states that new dates on the actual bit-worn teeth from the Dereivka stallion with
bit wear are from the Iron Age. This does not invalidate, however, the close association
among horses, "dogs, and the Indo-European peoples. Furthermore, there is still good
evidence for horseriding before 3000 BCE at Botai in northern Kazakhstan.)
89. McCone ("Hund, Wolf und Krieger bei den Indogermanen") argues that we have
sufficient evidence to prove Indo-European age-grades with the youngest group of military
age forming war-bands who assume dog or wolf totems, dress, etc. They live off the land
by raiding and constitute the shock troops of Indo-European warfare (something like

dog is sacred and inviolable. The dog also played a pivotal role in ancient and medieval
Iranian funeral ritual. This is in stark contrast to the lowly position of the dog in Iranian
society after the arrival of Muhammadanism.

Victor H. Mair, "Canine Conundrums"
Sino-Platonic Papers, 87 (November, 1998)
While this paper was in press, the author received an e-mail message (dated December 1,
1998) from Sandra Olsen concerning canine remains at Botai, a mid-fourth millennium to early
third millennium (3400-2700) BCE archeological site in northern Kazakhstan. Olsen, who has
been intensively studying the faunal evidence at Botai for several years, informed me that the
remains of 14 dogs have been identified, mostly buried in pits in houses or just outside houses.
Dogs almost never appear in kurgans, except, as at Sintashta (a Bronze Age fortification and large
burial plus ritual complex in Chelyabinsk Province of Russia dating to c. 2000-1600 BCE and
related to the Andronovo Culture), in the overburden, but rarely in the fill in the burial chamber
near the human remains. The Botai dogs are sized and proportioned just like Samoyeds. This
means that they would have been well-suited to cold winters and could have been used for pulling
sleds or sledges or for packing things. The Samoyed people use dogs for these purposes but also
use them for guarding their dwellings. Olsen believes that the Botai people did likewise, since they
buried dogs in their houses. It should be noted that hundreds of thousands of horse bones have
been discovered at Botai. Furthermore, there is evidence of horseriding at the site, as
demonstrated by Dorcas Brown and David Anthony in their "Bit Wear, Horseback Riding and the
Botai Site in Kazakstan," Journal or Archaeological Science, 25 (1998),331-347. For these and
other cultural reasons, it would appear that Botai has strong Indo-European affinities.
