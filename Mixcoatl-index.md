Mixcoatl
Mixcoatl (Nahuatl languages: Mixcōhuātl, [miʃˈkoːwaːt͡ɬ] from
mixtli [ˈmiʃt͡ɬi] "cloud" and cōātl [ˈkoːaːt͡ɬ] "serpent"), or Camaztle
[kaˈmaʃt͡ɬe] from camaz "deer sandal" and atle "without",[1] or
Camaxtli, was the god of the hunt and identified with the Milky
Way, the stars, and the heavens in severalMesoamerican cultures. He
was the patron deity of the Otomi, the Chichimecs, and several
groups that claimed descent from the Chichimecs. While Mixcoatl
was part of the Aztec pantheon, his role was less important than
Huitzilopochtli, who was their central deity. Under the name of
Camaxtli, Mixcoatl was worshipped as the central deity of
Huejotzingo and Tlaxcala.[2]

Mixcoatl is represented with a black mask over his eyes and distinctive red and white “candy-cane stripes” painted on his body.
These features are shared with Tlahuizcalpanteuctli, the Lord of the Dawn, god of the morning star, as well as Itzpapalotl, goddess of
infant mortality who was sometimes said to be his mother. Unlike Tlahuizcalpanteuctli,Mixcoatl can usually be distinguished by his
hunting gear, which included a bow and arrows, and a net or basket for carrying dead game.
Mixcoatl was one of four children of Tonacatecutli, meaning "Lord of Sustenance," an aged creator god, and Cihuacoatl, a fertility
goddess and the patroness of midwives. Sometimes Mixcoatl was worshipped as the "Red" aspect of the god Tezcatlipoca, the
"Smoking Mirror," who was the god of sorcerers, rulers, and warriors. In one story, Tezcatlipoca transformed himself into Mixcoatl
and invented the fire drill by revolving the heavens around their axes, bringing fire to humanity. Along with this cosmic fire drill,
Mixcoatl was the first to strike fire with flint. These events made Mixcoatl a god of the Milky aWy, along with war, and the hunt.
Mixcoatl was the father of 400 sons, collectively known as the Centzon Huitznahua, who ended up having their hearts eaten by
Huitzilopochtli. The Centzon Huitznahua met their demise when they, and their sister Coyolxauhqui, after finding their mother
Coatlicue pregnant, conspired to kill her. However, as they attacked she gave birth to a fully formed and armed Huitzilopochtli, who
proceeded to kill his half-siblings. Mixcoatl was also related to 400 more gods, the Centzonmimixcoa, whom, together with his 3
brothers (all different from the ones named above) and their sister, he slew by ambush. Mixcoatl was also thought of as being the
father of another important deit ,yQuetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent.

Mythology



Quetzalcoatl's father Mixcoatl was murdered; Quetzalcoatl was informed by Cozcaquauhtli that "the uncles who had killed his father
were Apanecatl, Zolton, and Cuilton.["3]
Quecholli, the 14th veintena, the 20-day Aztec month (November 19th Julian
calendar,[4] November 29th Gregorian calendar), was dedicated to Mixcoatl. The
celebration for this month consisted of hunting and feasting in the countryside. The
hunters would take the form of Mixcoatl by dressing like him, kindling a new fire to
roast the hunted game. Along with these practices, a man and woman would be
sacrificed to Mixcoatl at his temple.
In modern scientific nomenclature, the names Mixcoatl–Camaxtli have been
assigned to:
Camaxtli Patera, one of the paterae (shallow craters)on the Jovian moon of Io
Pseudoeurycea mixcoat,l a species of lungless salamanderendemic to Mexico
Mixcoatlus barbouri, a species of viper endemic to Mexico (previously Cerrophidion barbouri).[5]
Mixcoatlus browni, a species of viper endemic to Mexico (previously Agkistrodon browni).[5]
