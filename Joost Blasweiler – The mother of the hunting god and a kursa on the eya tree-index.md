The mother of the hunting god and a kursa on the eya tree.
(which deities are imaged on the Stag rhyton?)
This silver/gold rhyton in the form of a stag was produced from at least twelve separate pieces of
worked metal. It illustrates a libation ritual and the rhyton is from c.1400-1300 BC. (Beyond Babylon
2008, the Metropolitan Museum of Art). More Hittite silver vessels of these kind are known, like the Fist
and the Bull rhyton. There are called rhyta after their similarity to later horn-shaped vessels with
animal proteomes used for pouring and aerating wine. Technically they are not rhyta as they lack
drain holes in their bottoms. They are merely fancy drinking cups of a peculiar type that were
known in Hittite Akkadian asbiburu (H.G. Güterbock and Timothy Kendall 1995, A Hittite silver vessel in the form of
a fist, The Ages of Homer, 57).
There is an image of a tree on the rhyton where a kursa (a bag) might be hanged.

The scholar Maciej Popko stated in his dissertation of 1978 that the kursa (the fleece) played an important role in religion and many old Hittite festivals. The kursa was a sacral attribute and was offered as a representative of a god. Popko explained how the Hittite kursa, a bag of leather, was made according to a text:“They found the color and quality of the fleece important: six black rams
(and) two white rams: (from) one makes the Fleece” and KUB XXX 32 I 9 f.VI?:“six?fleecesoframs, (each)bushyandwellhandled,theOverseeroftheShepherdsmakesfo[r....(ofeachfleece]a godlikeFleece”.Some texts indicate that the kursa could have also be in the form of a shield or a cloth. It is then a cult symbol, which stands next to the sacral container with 20 arrows. Popko remarked that there is a possibility that the kursa was not a shield but a skin, a fleece, which protected the arrow container. Hans Gustav Güterbock remarked that kursas could also be made from other materials like wood, reed, copper and beads. In the KI.LAM festival the “kursas of beads” are carried in the procession, following the priest of the tutelary deity and the spears, but before the “animals of the gods", i.e.
images of wild animals made of precious metals. (Güterbock 1997, Perspectives on Hittite civilization, eds. Harry Hoffner JR., 1997 -139. H.G. Güterbock and T.Kendall 1995-55: One Hittite text mentions also two iron GESPÚ (fist) of a kursa.
Hans Gustav Güterbock1 described the pictures of the Stag-rhyton (above). The deer cups are
considered primary to the god of the Deer, so too the tutelary deity of the open fields (Volkert Haas
1994-535). The main figure on the rython is a seated deity, probably a goddess as she is depicted
wearing a long dress and is sitting on chair. It is quite possible she is Inara, the goddess of fertility
and nature, and the daughter of the Stormgod. She is holding a bird of prey, which appears to be a
falcon. In front there is a Hittite altar with its conical base. Unique to the rhyton is the youthful
god standing on a stag. According to Güterbock, the fact that he stands on a stag characterized him
as the tutelary god of the open country. As he is depicted bearing a staff for falconry or hunting, as
well as being young in appearance and standing on a deer, it is my opinion he might represent the
young sacral ruler of nature. Could it be Telepinu? We know Telipinu was a Storm god and a



3
Vegetation god. Albrecht Goetze (1957 Kulturgeschichte Kleinasiens, 143) remarked that his father is saying
of him:“He,mysonisproficient,hebreaksthelumpsofearthandheisplowing;hebringswaterto
it,heletgraingrow”.According to Goetze it is understandable that Telipinu is compared to
Tammuz, the Mesopotamian Vegetation god:”Onecanseeintheswordgodsliststhathefollowing
upEaandDamkina,andthesearetheparentsofTammuz”.
Volkert Haas (1994-437) states: “In the festivals, Inara is reproduced on several occasions as having the
features of the goddess of the hunt, and also as the mistress of the animals. In the KI.LAM. Festival
- a three-day festival which was celebrated in Hattusa –the leopard, the deer, and the boar are
offered as the animals of the goddess. From the temple of the goddess, Inara is featured in texts
from the Old Kingdom with a procession of these animals on the first day. Like other tutelary gods
of nature Inara could be worshipped as the figure of a kursa. Billie Jean Collins offers a great
amount of information about the procession of animals, which remained the focus of the first day in
the KI.LAM festival in its later form in the Empire Period, (Billie Jean Collins 2010,The Master of Animals in
Old World Iconography, 59 -71 ):

The idea that the god of the hunt bestows success on the human (royal) hunter is clearly laid out in
the Yalburt inscription, block 16 + 10 (Collins 2010 page 71):“theStorm-godlovesandIconqueredall

The goddess Inara originates from the Hattian religion and, according to Volkert Haas, seems to be
a daughter of the Stormgod (1994-436). In the Purulli new year festival she stands in the center of the
happening. It is custom for cult actors to always proclaim from the liver an oracle which relays the
salvation message from Inara.
In the Hittite kingdom she is both the tutelary and city-deity of Hattusa. In a thunder ritual a text
mentions: “the king and queen drink seated from the vessel of the Stormgod [-Wassezzili] .... King
and Queen drink seated from the vessel of Inara, and after that the goddess Inara is offered.... . Was
the Stag-rhyton perhaps “a vessel of Inara”? And the bull- rhyton a “vessel of the stormgod “?

The royal clan from Kussara who rebuilt the city Hattus, started to worship the gods of the Land
Hatti and they became participants in the Hattian cult, festivals and processions. Professor Alfonso
Archi tells us a lot about the gods that were taken with them from Kanesh, and how they were
sometimes integrated with Hattian gods (Alfonso Archi 2004, The Singer of Kanes and his Gods, AOAT, 13). They
worshipped a male god Inar1, who appears to have possessed similar functions with the Hattian
goddess Inara. “Which provoked a kind of assimilation between the two deities, notwithstanding
the difference of sex. The Hittite god consequently took the name of DInar-a-“. In the KI.LAM
festival of the spring Inara is linked to Habantali, the Goddess of the irrigated land. Therefore this
Inar would also have been a deity concerned with the realm of nature and, thus possibly, the
Tutelary-god of the open country. However, the royal clan were known to worship the gods they
knew separately. Only a few gods were assimilated.
Albrecht Goetze (1957-135) stated: Emile Forrer has first proposed the reading of Inar(as), as she is
mentioned in the lists of libations, and the reading of the goddess DKAL as Inar(as) is proven. It is
complicated, because there is also a Luwian god DKAL who is attested, probably a tutelary deity. He
is reading the name as Innara(s), which can be confusing, but mostly written with two n‘s. There is
another important goddess of the wild nature, who is said to be Teshapi, active in the Purulli
festival. In Hattian, her name is the Great Goddess. According to Volkert Haas (1994-438) she can be
viewed as either one aspect of Inara or just another name of Inara. During the Purulli festival a
hunter and masked Leopard man are dancing, and there are also wolf-men who are dancing for the
goddess. In the descriptions about the rhyton the names of the sitting deity and the young stag
deity on the deer of the silver rhyton are not known.
1. In an old Hittite thunder ritual one can read that he king and the queen are drinking out the cup of the deity Inar (GAL DInar). They drink also out the cup of the Stormgod (GAL D ISKUR) and the cup of the deity Wasezzil (Erich Neu 1970, Ein Althethitisches Gewitterritual, 23).
I have enquired of Ton van Bakel, who is usually involved in the study of seals from Babylon and
Sumer, to give his opinion regarding the picture of the rhyton: the pictures remind him of the birth
of goddesses in March, a process which is thought to have occurred every year. He also wonders if
the deity on the deer is a female? Is this not a young goddess? Bakel has also pointed out that the
young deity bore a bird. He remarked that, in Sumerian, the bird is the sign for fate and destiny.
The dear is probably a representation of death and imagined to be asserting a message such as: “be
my hunter”. He pointed out that the deer does not appear to be shown as moving or in action.
Animals which are protecting a holy tree or source are mostly depicted to be a serpent, a crocodile,



6
a lizard or a turtle. These are animals which can stay for hours motionless. The sitting deity holds a
drinking cup, which can show a relation with the constellation the Carter, so as is to be seen more
or less in the zodiac of Denderah (Egypt). The deer can also be a symbol of Andromeda, the
celestial stag, in Akkadian LU.LIM = lulimu “the Stag”. Bakel also wonders who the figures are who
gave offerings to the deities?
These are good questions and remarks. There are no images found of little boys and girls of the
land of Hattusa, so we do not know how they were dressed. The sitting deity looks female, but it is
uncertain if she was indeed female. The young deity looks to be a child of the sitting deity.
To compare the picture with the process of the arising of the birth of the (young) new year is
certainly an option.
The tree of the picture might be the evergreen (eya-) tree. It is possible to see the attributes of the
hunt hanging on the tree: the quiver and the kursa(bag) of the hunt. The spears could also be a
symbol of the hunt. However, in a text about processions one “is walking behind the tutelary deity
and the spears”, so the spears were probably a symbol of protection and a symbol of the tutelary
deity him- or herself. The two spears are standing behind the deity, making it conceivable that the
picture was divided on the rhyton by a handle, so after some research Hans Gustav Güterbock
found the following (start of the) drawing more acceptable:
Güterbock A note on the frieze of the stag Rhyton in the Schimmel collection, festschrift Akurgal, Anadolu XXII 1981-1983.
The spears are also known from guards of the king, the men of the bronze and the golden spear2.
And Volkert Haas mentioned the lance of Inara in a ritual by the king of the palace guards(1994-759).
Haas stated that the lance is an attribute and symbol of the LAMMA deities of nature, and that the
lance was offered itself. Bread and libation offers to the “lance of Inara” in several large festivals
rituals are attested (1994-453).
The deer lying under the tree is probably death, although the deer is a symbol of the stag-god(dess).
Güterbock has reported in his article that the deer is death and, more precisely, that the elements shown behind the god are the head of a stag and two severed lower legs of the animal. He has also



7
stated:“Theconceptofdeposingthecatchwithagodassacrificeafterasuccessfulhuntisnotalien toHittiteart.Iwouldliketoaddthattheemphasisonthestagofferingsseeninthese representationsremindmeofthe“deerfestival”mentionedinsometext”.In the KI.LAM Festival
(the festival of the gates, probably a harvest festival) stag figures were carried in the processions3. A text regulating the cult of the tutelary deity of the town of Karahna mentions among the festivals for this deity one called EZENhurnayayassar,a name that may be derived from the verbhurn(iya)
to hunt and might mean ‘Festival of the Hunt’(H. Güterbock 1989, Hittite Kursa “Hunting Bag”, Fs H.Kantor,118).
When one looks well to the picture, one could see that the crossed legs of the stool of the sitting deity, are imaged as deer legs !
It is also known that the birds, probably falcons and the (small) staff of falconry4 shows the hunt,
and the falcon is also connected with oracles.
Volkert Haas explained the GIS (wood)eja-tree. It is normally translated as ‘the ever green tree’ or post.
It is obviously not a conniver, but is to do with a “large and mighty tree”, which had a long life
span. Also the wood of the tree was important, as the wood was usable and hard enough for spears.
So it appeared according to Volkert Haas believes this appeared to be an oak, from the evergreen
forest in Anatolia in the ancient (Volkert Haas 1977, AoF V, 269-270).
The scholar Lia Rietveld has been so kind as to offer some explanations about the hieroglyphs and the imaged figures according to a Luwian milieu:“Abovethesittinggoddessisfiguredthree

J. David Hawkins wrote also about the cuneiform hieroglyphs of the Stag Rhyton:
J.D.Hawkins2006,TudhaliyatheHunter,ThelifeandTimesofHattusiliIIIandTutahaliyaIV,52:
Machteld J. Mellink mentioned that the Phrygian mother goddess Kubile is wearing a long robe,
belt and veil and her attributes are typical of his early stage: a hawk-like bird, and a bowl/cup or
pitcher (1977,Temples and High Places in Phrygia,Temples and High Places in Biblical Times,100).
However, there are important uncertainties about the relation with Kybele, such as the sitting deity
does not bearing her veil or high cap of Kubaba (or Kubile/Kybele). It also appears that the
attributes of a mountain deity are missing and that she is sitting on a kind of stool.
J. Davids Hawkins (2006,52) stated that the symbols above the sitting deity with FILIA suggest that
she was the daughter of the Stag God and not his consort.
The category of tutelary gods, referred on Hittite texts to the logogram LAMMA, is characteristic of
Luwian beliefs. They were earthly deities, just like all the gods protecting the country side,
household, and family. The oldest form of the Tutelary deity in the Hittite kingdom was the female
Inara. John Gregory Mc Mahon described the use of DLAMMA to pointed to the goddess Inara.
One explanation for DLAMMA as Inara was the expression such as ‘Inara of the River’. Mahon was

The gods, the Luwian Annari and Hittite Inara, were assigned the role of guardians of particular
deities. The stag god Kurunti(ya) was the tutelary god of the Countryside, who appears with his
consort Ala in a text in the time period relating to the reign of Tudhaliya IV (Taracha 2009, 110-111). The
hunting aspect of the Stag-god is emphasized in texts of the same period:“theStag-godloves,andI
Hero,FieldsMaster,Hunter,GreatKing”. Piotr Taracha wrote,“Adistantechoofthisthirteenth
centurytoposcanbefoundintheeightcenturyBOHÇAinscription,itselfapparentlycelebratinga
successfulhunt”.”IamgoodtoRuntiya,herehegrantsthesamayabeasts“.
The spread of the cult of LAMMA gods in central and northern Anatolia is attested by the high
rank of the LAMMA god Kurunti(ya) in the Hittite pantheon3. The worship of the LAMMA god of
the kursa developed in effect, and it was celebrated in a large part of the land. The old kursas
retained their divinity and some of them, like Zitharija, continued to be worshipped solely in
impersonal form.
So the sitting deity on the rhyton with her epigraphs above her, represents a goddess related with
the tutelary deity of the Countryside.
The image fig. 11 in the article of Billy Jean Collins 2010, Hero, Field Master, King: Animal
Mastery in Hittite Texts and Iconography (The Master of Animals in Old World Iconography Edited by D.B. Counts
and B. Arnold), can give perhaps some help to indentify the goddess :

It is almost certain that Kupapa is the same figure as Kubaba, (= (DEUS)ku +AVIS, Ku-ba-ba, ku(i)papa),
according to Laroche also Kubelē or Kubēbē).
When Šuppiluliuma I conquered Karkemish in about 1360 BC a text let us know: “sincehefeared
thegods,ontheuppercitadelheletsnooneintothepresenceofthedeityKubabaandofthedeity
KAL,andhedidnotrushclosetoanyoneofthetemples.Nay,heevenbowedtothem”.
(H.G. Güterbock 1956, The deeds of Šuppiluliuma as told by his son, Mursili II, JCS 10, 95).
Volkert Haas reported that the mountain-mother Kubaba originates from Northern Syria . In this
region the mountain gods and the mountain-mothers were closely connected. In the 18th c. BC.
Kubaba was the ‘goddess and queen’ of Karkamish, and she is already known from the Old
Assyrian trade texts with the name Kubabat. Her companion is the god Adamma, perhaps a com
pellation of Ada (father) and Amma (mother). It is possible that Adamma was a hermaphrodite,
like Kybele (Rhea) was originally in a Greek myth. Volkert Haas stated that hermaphroditical gods
are not attested in Hittite texts, but on Büyükkale, in an ‘Old Hittite level’, was found a figure of
terracotta which was bisexual (Haas 1982,Hethitischer Berggötter, 99, see also Bittel 1955, MDOG 88, 22). He
continued: “Perhaps common people worshipped hermaphroditical beings”.
Maurits van Loon (1990-9) remarked that Kubabat appears as the most prominent native Anatolian
goddess, perhaps to be identified as the goddess on a lion throne often pictured on seals. In the
New Kingdom she seems to have receded into the background except at Karkemish., whose king
Ini-Tesub c. 1250 BC invokes “the Lady Kubaba, mistress of the land of Karkemish”. Van Loon
stated: “ItremainsdifficulttoexplainwhythecultofKubabaengulfedallofcentralandwestern
AnatoliaintheearlierfirstmillenniumBC.,almosttotheexclusionofotherdeities.Obviouslythe
‘Neo-Hittite’divineladyoftheearthwasindentifiedwiththeoldAnatolianmistressofnatureand
thewildanimals”.ThefalconappearsinhernamewhichiswrittenKu+FALCON-pa(-pa).
The Phrygian Kybele is closely connected with Kubaba (Haas, 1982-97, R. Gusmani , Der lydische Name der
Kybele, Kadmos 9 1969, 158). There is a discussion that speculates if Kubaba could be connected with
Kybele. Recently Mark Munn has described the discussion, and he concludes that although there
seems no account of the relation between their names, it is obvious that Anatolian Kubaba is a clear
name, while Kubeleya in the Phrygian Matar Kubeleya is an epithet, that plausibly can be derived
from the older name of Kubaba. More over the Old Greek scholars became familiar with Kybebe, a



13
goddess of the Phrygians and the Lydians and they understood her to be the same goddess known
from her many sacred places, called Kubeleya. (Mark Munn 2008, Kybele as Kubaba in a Lydo-Phrygian Context,
Anatolian Interfaces, 159-164).

In the Phrygian time period Kubaba is portrayed upon a throne, when she is sitting, and she is wearing a huge cap. Cybele (below) is sitting on a throne or on a sacral wagon and is wearing a crown, mostly representing a city. Here is she imaged in an ’East-Greek’ stile.
In this quest of Kubaba was imaged on the Stag rhyton it is probably a statement which Maurits
van Loon deemed to be important (1985, Anatolia in the second millennium BC. Iconography of Religions XV 12, page
15). He wrote about the Stag-rhyton,“She(thesittingdeity)isthehuntinggod’smother.Afalconis
alsothelatersymbolofKubaba,stronglysuggestingsomelinkbetweenthatpopulargoddessofthe
firstmillenniumandthehuntinggod’smother”.This is a very attractive definition.
(The statement he repeated in his book 1990–page 9: “on the relief of Firaktin 13th C. and the stag rhyton of the Schimmel collection the mistress of nature and the wild animals is accompany with the young hunting god”).
Libation to the mistress of the animals and the war god (plate IX Van Loon 1985).
It reminds me of the seals of the Old Assyrian time period that were used in central Anatolia. This
is something that Maurits van Loon has also described in his book (1985, pages 3):“The‘mistressof



15
animals’,probablyanage-olddeitynativetoAnatolia,isshownseatedonandpeacefully
surroundedbyanimals”.“Themasterofanimalofgodofthechase,(is)regularlyshownbare
headedandarmedonlywithacrook”.Another picture exists of the mistress of the animals, in
which she is armed and kills :“Herrightarmhasbecomeahook,fromwhichahare(?)ishanging
down,whileherlefthandismergedwithabird(?)whichsheisholdingup.Anotherbirdseems
attachedtoherleftelbow.Falconandhareareregularlyheldbythegodofthechaseonseals”.
Was the picture on the Stag rhyton a follow-up of the images of the mistress of the animals? And
was she the mother of the hunting god?
Conclusion:
It has already been mentioned that Volkert Haas (1994-437) wrote that in the festivals it is several
times seen that Inara has the features of the goddess of the hunt and that she is the mistress of the
animals. It appears to be the most probable explanation, in which the mentioned relations with the
figures of the goddess of Inara/Teshapi and later on Kupapa/Kubaba/ Cybele would set well. We
do not have to forget that the rhyton has the form of a stag 6, the sacral animal of the Tutelary deity
of the Countryside. So almost all the indications are pointing to the Hittite-Hattian form of Inara. If
so, then it seems reasonable that her child, a tutelary deity on the stag, who is wearing the attributes
of falconry and a falcon himself, is the young hunting god. It cannot be Telipinu, who was the son
of the Stormgod of the sky and the Sun Goddess as he has other characteristics. It is possible that
we see here an explanation of the arising of the stag Kurunti(ya), the tutelary god of the
Countryside god or Innara , the male form of Inara5, with his Luwian roots. By the time of
Tudhaliya IV, Innara and Kuruntiya were no longer separate deities, as indicated by the fact that
both Innara and Kuruntiya underlie ‘CERVUS’ in the Hieroglyphic writing of the Stag God6 of the
King (Billy Jean Collins 2010 The Master of Animals in Old World Iconography 2010, 66).
Only the hieroglyphs above the sitting deity makes this explanation uncertain. Would the
combination á-x-DEUSx -FILIA on the rhyton of the Tutelary deity of the Countryside pointed at
the goddess Inara?

©Near Eastern Archaeology 72-4, 2009 - professor Kay Kohlmeyer. Halab Iron age temple: the first figure below show not special attributes besides a horned cap, and a kilt with tassels, with a raised hand carry a double rod. His hair falls in along curl down his back and he ha s a short cheek-to- chin beard, the other figure wears a pointed helmet and stand on a ribbon possible symbolizing water. The pair off thunderbolts identifies him as a stormgod, while the short crook established him as a tutelary god.

On the Stag Rhyton, perhaps the vessel of Inara, one man is pouring a libation, one carrying a loaf
of bread, (its sides looks like the hieroglyph for bread), and a kneeling man who holds up a pitcher,
known from Hittite texts as ‘the cupbearer of squatting’. However these are their functions, so the
question remains as to who these men are. It is possible that they are important priests, servants of
the deity, and therefore it’s likely that they belong to the royal clan. Their images are not small and
they do not look especially humble.
Placed behind the sitting deity stands the Hittite eya tree. In the opinion of Güterbock, the kursa is
hanging from the tree, which he asserts to be a sacral hunting bag. In the excavated Hittite texts it
is not mentioned that a quiver hangs on the eya-tree. Jaan Puhvel7 mentioned that there could be
another relation in a text “The god had a quiver and inside were twenty arrows. Two iron clips of a
skin bag (kursa) are lost”. And Puhvel remarked that this text would have a relation also with the
bow and a metonymic use of a shield. The symbols in the tree are the attributes of LAMMA.
John Gregory Mc Mahon stated that gods with DLAMMA in their title or in their name have to be
understood as tutelary deities (The Hittite state cult of the Tutelary Deities , 213).
On the rhyton (biburu) it seems obvious that a kursa was used as a cult symbol for the hunt7.
Besides the extensive use of kursa in the festivals of the spring (the festivals for the return of the stormgod
Telipinu, the return of the spring and summer rains, the fertility and the growth), there was apparently also an old
tradition of the use of the kursa in the ceremonies of the hunt. No indications are found in texts for
a profane use of the kursa8.
It is conceivable that the kursa was used to keep food and attributes, which one always needs, such
as tools. It is also possible that it contained amulets and sacral stones. It is known that in the
prehistoric times of Anatolia the gods were imaged in little (huwasi-) stones or later on in small
statues, in which a god was figured. The kursa of herds and hunters contained supposedly what



18
they would have needed to survive. So the kursa would have been considered important in daily live
and perhaps that was the reason that it became sacral. In texts the hunting kursa appears sometimes
when the bow and arrows are mentioned, and in the sentence9: “they purvey leopard- and lion skins
kuskursas UG.TUR UG.MAH”. We have to imagine that the hunt had in the ancient times a great
impact in the culture, cult and feasts of the tribes and communities. Traditions which could stay
relevant throughout the millenniums.

2. More units functioned for the guarding and security in the palaces and temples: the Golden Spear Men, the Heavy Spear Men, the
Bronze Spear Men, the Spear Men (LU.MES GISSUKUR) and the Palace Servants. Spearmen of the guards appear to have been subsumed perhaps by the sarikuwa-troops and maybe the most of the spearmen were field army troops detached to form the outer rings of guards around the king. Richard .H. Beal 1992, Organization of the Hittite Army 230, 341. In festival texts also the Iron spear is mentioned.
3. Also Daniel Schwemer mentioned in an article the connection: “ the Hittite Stag-god DKAL — Hittite Innara, Luwian Annari,
Hittite-Luwian Kurunti(ya) — was associated with Mesopotamian DLÀMA =lamassu, the protective deity, in the same lexical entry”. (Daniel Schwemer 2011, Hittite Prayers to the Sun-God for appeasing an Angry personal god, a critical edition of CTH 372-74, 11). Billie Jean Collins 2002, a History of the animal world, handbook of the oriental studies, section one vol.64, chapter eleven: ANIMALS IN THE RELIGIONS OF ANCIENT ANATOLIA, page 328 : AnimalsoftheGods:Several lists of animals, occurring in a variety of text genres in the Hittite material, are attested that include the leopard, lion, boar, bear, deer, and optionally the wolf, gazelle, and wild goat (for texts see Collins 1989: 298-99). These stock lists includes all of the big game animals, and the KI.LAM Festival identifies them as "animals of the gods"(siunashuitar),a phrase that may signify their special importance in Hittite religious ideology. The procession in the KI.LAM Festival begins with the "animals of the gods" and the "masters of the words."They are followed by performers, oxen-drawn carts, and dancers. Next come priests of the Protective Deity, who in some of his forms is a hunting god. These are followed by spears, copper ma-fetishes and then again the "animals of the gods" (leopard, lion, boar, bear, gazelle). In a parallel version, the "dog-men" or "hunters" follow. After some singing in Hattic by the men of the town of Anunuwa, the deer standards follow, drawn by various officials. The procession then exits through the upper gate. Later, the king is relieved of the ceremonial iron spear with which he was presented before the ceremony, and it is replaced with an iron axe. Page 329: Animal behavior is not uncommon in the context of Hittite ritual. For instance, in Zarpiya's Ritual, one of a group of young boys is dressed in a goat skin and made to howl like a wolf. Elsewhere, ritual dancers crouch "like leopards." Among the numerous cult functionaries attested in Hittite religious documents, a few bear professional titles drawn from the animal world. The lion-men, leopard-men, bear-men, wolf-men and dog-men are attested with varying degrees of frequency and are seen performing a wide range of ritual and religious duties. All of the animals in these titles are counted among the "animals of the gods" except the dog, whose role in the hunt was as the hunter's companion. (Note in this context their frequent association with archers(miniya-men)and withhapiya-mcn(who are also almost certainly a category of human hunter). The activities of these functionaries are varied. They dance (wolf-men, bear-men), run (wolf-men), bark (dog-men), sing (dog-men), and assist in administrative activities. But it is clear that their primary function is to role-play in ritual performance, taking on the behavior of the animals whose names they bear. In one ritual performance, “the female archer shoots one time with an arrow (at) the bear-man. She misses him, but she shoots a second (time) and pierces him. She shouts,'awaiya,ayaiya"(Collins 1989: 100). The Festival for Teteshapi seems also to have a hunting theme, with the leopard-men playing a prominent role. At one point, "[they chase the leopard-man up into the mountains" (Bo 6594 i l l '; Collins 1989: 303). Does this performance have to do with a mock hunt or a ritualized removal of the forces of destruction from a vulnerable village? In any case ,the ritual treatment of the bear- and leopardmen is part of a single phenomenon in which humans behave like animals in ritual enactments that relate to the hunt. 3. Piotr Taracha 2009, Religions of Second Millennium Anatolia, 112: This also played a role in the personification of the ancient tutelary divinities worshipped in the form of a kursa-bag, who were included as a result of this process in the LAMMA category.
Volkert Haas described the sumerogram of the tutelary deity is the sign KAL in the readings ALA(D) and LAMMA. DAla(D) is in
Akkadian the tutelary god of the house Sēdu, like the Hittite tarpis. DLAMMA is the female tutelary deity Lamassu, like the Hittite
annaris, in duplicate DLAMMA-as = DInaras. ALA(D) perhaps originates to the Aala/Ala tutelary deities, all the more the deities LAMMA and Aala form in local cults sometimes a pair. 4. There was a discussion if falconry existed in the bronze age of Anatolia ( Karin Reiter, Falknerei im Alten Orient? Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Falknerei,MDOG120 (1988), pp. 189-206). Jeane Vorys proved in her article: Falconry (Hawking) in Hittite Lands 2002 JNES Vo. 61- 3, 161-201 that falconry in central Anatolia existed at least from the OA period. 5. In the early Old Kingdom there was already a male Nesite(Hittite) god Inar, perhaps he was seen as an the ancestor god? The symbols in the tree are the attributes of LAMMA. The Hattians knew also a goddess of the deer Hapantali(ya)(Volkert Haas 2006, Die hethitischen Literatur. 127). Volkert Haas Hethitschen Orakel 2008,Vorzeichen un Abweherstrategien, 12: “ The central gods in the rituals of the Augurs are the LAMMA gods, with the Hittite reading DINGIRInar and DINGIRKurunta, they are primary



20
protector deities of the nature. The proto-Hittite iconography of Kurunta is a god standing on a stag. He has in one hand a raptor and in the other hand a hare. His Luwian hieroglyph is a stag of only the antler in the Luwian reading Runtiya. Kuruntiya and Runtiya are linguistical not a problem” Volkert Haas reported that Kurunta-Runtiya, like Karhuhi-Karhuha are the‘paredros’of Kubaba. Who was worshipped in Karkamish and Malataya. The Pantheon of Karkamish did not show a Stag god, it seems that the LAMMA god and the ‘paredros‘of Kubabba is in Karakamish Karhuhi-Karhuha and in Malatay Kurunta-Runtiya. So it is assumed that the myth of the god Kurunta would originate from the Stag god of Malatya. (Volkert Haas, Religionen des Alten Orients Teil II: Hethiter, 192). 6. B.J. Collins On the Trail of the Deer, in her study she concludes: The iconography certainly testifies to the great importance of antlers in the hunt and in religious symbolism. The proposed etymological link betweenkurala-‘hart’ and the name of the god on the Stag, Runta, along with that of his royal namesake Kurunta , strengthens the link between the two in iconography at the expense of the fallow deer. In addition, the fact that Runta and Kurunta are both written with CERVUS, a picture of an antler, supports understandingkurala-specifically as ‘heart’ in Anatolian rather as red deer’ generally.
