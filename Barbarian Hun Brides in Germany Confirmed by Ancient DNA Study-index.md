# Index for Barbarian Hun Brides in Germany Confirmed by Ancient DNA Study.pdf

Pointy Skulls Belonged to ‘Foreignʼ Brides, Ancient DNA Suggests
March 12, 2018
Skulls unearthed from 1,400-year-old burials in southern Germany may show signs of intensive- or
moderate skull modification, left and center, which researchers believe is a cultural practice seen in
tribes from further east.

During the Migration Age (ca. 300-700 A.D.), "barbarian" groups like
the Goths and Vandals roved around Europe, nibbling away at the



declining Roman Empire and settling down as they went along. One
tribe that got comfortable was the Bavarii, who hunkered down in
what is now southern Germany around the sixth century A.D. And
inside Bavarii cemeteries, archaeologists find interesting specimens:
Women with elongated skulls.
Thatʼs long confused researchers, who associate such skull
modification in Europe at the time with places further east such as
Hungary. Southeast Europe at the time was home to the feared
confederacy of tribes known as the Huns, and their burial grounds
contain many more long-skulled ladies than further west in Bavaria.
So how did the practice make it to Germany?
One theory is that the Huns or some other group transmitted the
skull-modifying technique—the equivalent of a meme that local
Bavarian women then took up themselves. But a new study
published in the journal PNAS suggests another answer: Maybe the
Bavarian women with the unusual skulls werenʼt Bavarian to begin
with.
An international team of researchers recently analyzed the genomes
of 36 sets of bones buried in six Bavarian cemeteries during the fifth
and sixth centuries A.D.: twenty-six women, 14 of whom showed
signs of artificial cranial deformation (ACD), and ten men. They also
analyzed five additional samples, including remains of what is
thought to be a Roman soldier and two other women with ACD from
Crimea and Serbia.



TIL: You Might Be Related to Genghis Khan
The rise of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian empire was responsible for the annihilation of an
estimated 40 million people, but there were clearly more than a few conquests off the battlefield as
well. A 2003 study suggests that 1 in 200 men are direct descendants of Genghis Khan.
The womenʼs skulls didnʼt get that way by accident. Their heads
were carefully bound starting at birth, and their skulls kept their
distinctive looks as they hardened. Archaeologists arenʼt sure if the
practice had to do with beauty, health, or another reason.
The researchers sequenced parts of the buried Bavariansʼ DNA, and
the entire genomes of 11 samples. Then they used the data to learn
about the appearance, ancestral origins and health of the long-dead
Bavarians.
The men—likely farmers in small communities— looked pretty much
alike. But many of the women didnʼt look like the men. At all.

It wasnʼt just the skull modifications: While the menʼs genes showed
that they likely had blond hair and blue eyes, the women likely had



brown eyes and blond or brown hair.
Looks were just the tip of the iceberg. The researchers compared the
ancient genes to those of modern people and found some big
differences between male and female.
The menʼs genes were similar to those of northern and central
Europeans. The women with modified skulls, however, had a much
more diverse set of ancestors. The majority matched up with
southeastern Europeans like Romanians and Bulgarians, and one
even had East Asian ancestors.
“Archaeologically, they are not that different from the rest of the
population,” says Joachim Burger, a population geneticist at the
University of Mainz and an author of the study. “Genetically, they are
totally different.”
From what researchers can tell, the women assimilated and adopted
local traditions—and skull modification seems to have stopped with
them. So why did they have such different genes?

Burger is quick to admit he doesnʼt know for sure. But he and his
colleagues have a theory. They think their data shows a previously
unconfirmed practice of exchange between the Bavarians and other
cultures, even in what Burger calls “relatively boring, blond farm
places.”
Though she didnʼt work on the current study, Susanne Hakenbeck, a
University of Cambridge historical archaeologist, has spent years
trying to piece together the stories of the same women and others
with ACD throughout Europe.



When Hakenbeck analyzed isotopes from bones in one of the
cemeteries in the current study, she found dietary differences
between men and women. Her analyses of skull modifications of the
era also back up the hypothesis: ACD was common among men,
women and children living between Central Asia and Austria at the
time, but is only seen in a handful of adult women in places further
west, like Germany.
"Nobody thought that marriage and kinship had a really important
function in the period,” says Hakenbeck. The new research could
prove that wrong; the women seem to have arrived specifically to
marry Bavarian men, perhaps as the result of a strategic alliance.
The study has its limitations: It doesnʼt deal with a large population,
and two of the samples were buried later than the rest of the group.
However, those womenʼs ancestors came from even further away
than the others, which might suggest a pattern of marriage
migrations.
Think the confrontation between a group of dark-haired, skull
modded strangers and some blond farmers sounds like the premise
of a bingeworthy Netflix series? So does Burger. “There are exotic
women with exotic skulls coming to these boring foreign places,” he
says. “Culture clash.”
