Health Tips for Meditation
Remember that meditation and a healthy body can work together in a constructive cycle. The practice of meditation is an important element in your overall program for maintaining good health. Good health practices in your daily life will aid your meditation life. Below are areas to which you might want to pay particular attention:
Diet
Eat a good, balanced diet, with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. The Edgar Cayce readings recommended:
• that 80 percent of the diet consist of nonstarchy vegetables and fruits, with the remaining 20 percent provided by proteins, cereals, and starches. • that meat intake consist mainly of fish, fowl, and lamb, with red meat eaten only sparingly and pork rarely or never. • that we avoid overly processed foods, all fried foods, and foods containing white flour and/or sugar.



11
Rest and Recreation
Adequate rest and recreation are essential parts of a balanced lifestyle. Be sure to get adequate sleep in order to avoid fatigue during your meditation experience. Recreation helps to relax both your body and mind, which is important when you sit down to meditate.
Eliminate Toxins From Your Body
The elimination of toxins—the waste products left over after the body has digested and metabolized its food—is crucial to good health. You eliminate toxins through your skin, lungs, bowels, and kidneys. The following practices are all helpful:
• Breathe deeply and fully, remembering to exhale completely. Breathing exercises before meditation help here, but you should also develop the habit of breathing deeply throughout the day. • Drink at least six to eight glasses of pure water daily, which will help remove toxins and wastes from your body. • Bowel eliminations should be kept regular through proper diet (including lots of fiber) and exercise, especially walking.



12
Exercise
Exercise will help keep your body healthy and aid in stress reduction. Always check with your doctor before embarking on any new program of exercise. Moderate, consistent exercise is more helpful than sporadic, strenuous workouts. Gentle stretching and daily walks will go a long way toward keeping you fit and releasing tensions.
Finally, remember that you are a whole person, with all parts working together. Your attitudes and emotions are vital to good health. As you meditate daily, it will have an impact on your physical health. As you pay attention to basic health practices listed here, you’ll find your meditation life enhanced as well.



13
Tracing Your Thoughts
When the silence ended, were you thinking about:
Particular people? Worries on your mind?
Upcoming events or things to do?
When the silence ended, I was thinking about:
Sounds going on around you?
Problems you need to solve?
Past or future conversations?



14
A great exercise in tracing your thoughts: Write your final thought at the center of the spiral and then see if you can work your way back to the first thoughts you were having as the meditation began.



15
Chants for Meditation
The Cayce readings recommend certain chants as very effective in connecting us with spiritual realms. These sounds are voiced on the audiotapes.
Take a long, deep breath, and chant these sounds as you slowly exhale. See if you can make the sounds vibrate deeply within yourself. Repeat up to a dozen times or more before meditating.
In reading 1158-10, we are told that the following syllables awaken the ability to draw God’s love:
ahrrrrrr—eeeee—ooooo—mmmmm
The “e” and “o” are both “long,” as in “seek” and “home.”
A second chant uses a variant of the four Hebrew letters of Yahweh and is sounded as:
Yah — hay — vah — hay
This chant, according to reading 2533-8, can awaken within us the ability to know ourselves to be individuals, yet one with the Whole.



16
Moving to the Deeper Levels of Meditation
Stage One: Think about what the words of the affirmation mean.
Stage Two: As you continue thinking about what the affirmation means, you begin to feel what it means.
Let me be a channel of blessings to someone today . . . Let me be a channel of blessings . . .
. . . channel of blessings to someone today . . . Let me . . .
Gives
way to Feeling the sense of the affirmation, rather than
thinking about it



17
Stage Three: As you hold on to the feeling of the affirmation, your awareness shifts to experiencing it.
Or: You notice your mind has wandered, and you gently go back to Stage One.
Feeling the affirmation
Leads to
experiencing the affirmation
Let me be a channel of blessings to someone today . . . Let me be . . .

Making Up Your Personal Prayer List
People who have asked for your prayers or given you permission to pray for them:
People, causes, or organizations who have not asked for prayer, but for whom you have a concern:



19
Decision Making with Meditation
Part One: List the decisions you need to make in different areas of your life:
Work:
Relationships:
Errands:
Finances:
Purchases:
Family:
Health:
Other:



20
Part Two: The Steps in Decision Making
1. Select one small decision you want to make, and formulate a question that can be answered “yes” or “no”:
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
2a. Consider the decision from as many angles as possible. Of what facts and issues are you already aware?
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
2b. Will your decision affect others? If so, how?
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________



21
2c. What are the likely consequences of each way of deciding?
Good Results
Unwanted Results
“Yes” “No”
2d. Breathe into your heart three times, and then see how you feel as you imagine going with a “yes” decision. Also watch for any images that might come to mind:
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
With a “no” decision:
___________________________________________
___________________________________________



22
2e. Hold each answer, together with your spiritual ideal and your ethical views. Check compatibility with:
“yes”: ___________________________________________
“no”: ___________________________________________
3. Considering all of your answers so far, make a tentative decision:
yes no
4. Now, put this tentative decision aside and meditate.
5. At the conclusion of your quiet time, silently ask your “yes” or “no” question, give the tentative answer you reached earlier, and then wait for any feelings or images that come to mind.



23
Note those here:
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
What would you say is the “inner” answer?
yes no
6. If you are unsure of your inner guidance, you may repeat these steps on another day. However, if you feel confident that your decision is the right one, think about how you might act on your decision.
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
___________________________________________
7. Take the action, and watch for results.

Prayers
The Lord’s Prayer:
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
As I open myself to the unseen forces that surround the throne of beauty, grace, and might, I throw about myself the protection that is found in the thoughts of Him.
A Prayer of Protection:



26
The Twenty-Third Psalm:
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Grateful Acknowlegments
This course is based on an earlier one, Meditation Made Easy, by Lynn Sparrow. Our deepest thanks to Lynn and to the original narrator, Sharon Fazel.
We also thank Cecil Guile for perfectly transcribing the audiotapes from the original course, and Susan Lendvay and Dan Campbell for their beautiful editing of that transcript.
Our gratitude also to Kevin Todeschi and Mark Thurston, Ph.D., for their many suggestions. Much of the credit for the final quality of this course goes to them, while we reserve for ourselves the responsibility for the remaining deficiencies.
Our appreciation to Frank Henry, our marvelous recording engineer, who suggested that the A.R.E. Meditation Room in Virginia Beach would be more appropriate than a studio for recording these tapes. Frank oversaw the production of this course, and did so with dexterity and a sense of “high play.”
We also extend our gratitude to Charles Thomas Cayce, one of the busiest people we know, for taking many hours from his schedule to narrate this course. He brings great “heart” to all that he does, and you will hear that quality on the tapes.

Edgar Cayce was born on a farm near Hopkinsville, Kentucky. At an early age he gave evidence of his budding talent: he was able to master his school lessons by sleeping on his books. At the age of twenty-one he developed a gradual throat paralysis which threatened the loss of his voice. When doctors were unable to find a cause for his condition, Cayce entered the same hypnotic sleep that had enabled him to learn his school lessons years before. In that state, he was able to recommend a cure which successfully repaired his throat muscles and restored his voice. It was soon discovered that he could do the same for others.
For most of his adult life, Edgar Cayce was able to provide intuitive insights into nearly any question imaginable. When individuals came to him with a question, he would place himself into a self-induced sleep state. While in that state he could respond to virtually any question asked. His responses have come to be called “readings.” Today his psychic readings constitute one of the largest and most impressive records of intuitive information to emanate from a single individual.
About Edgar Cayce

For many years the information dealt mainly with medical problems. Eventually the scope of his readings expanded to include such topics as meditation, dreams, reincarnation, and prophecy. The transcripts have provided the basis for more than 300 popular books about Cayce’s work.
Cayce would eventually give more than 14,000 readings on some 10,000 different topics to people all over the world. These readings continue to be researched and written about more than half a century after his death and are available to students, writers, researchers, medical professionals, and A.R.E. members the world over.

About the A.R.E.
The Association for Research and Enlightenment, Inc., was founded in 1931 to research and make available the information in the psychic readings of Edgar Cayce. The A.R.E., which opens its membership to all, continues that work today through its publications, research, conferences, seminars, lectures, tours, camp, and other activities.
The more than 14,000 documented Cayce readings are housed at the A.R.E.’s Virginia Beach headquarters and discuss thousands of health and spiritual topics, including soul development, holistic health, reincarnation, dreams, intuition, life purpose, and ancient civilizations.
The A.R.E.’s membership comes from around the world, drawing together tens of thousands of those who are seeking answers to life’s questions.
