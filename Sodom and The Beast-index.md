The Beast
From the Bottomless Pit
And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. (Dan 12:1)
No serious Bible student can doubt that the crisis described here in the book of Daniel is very near. Like the song says, “signs of the times are everywhere.” The political, social and religious developments taking place on the planet tell us that the prophecies of the Bible, particularly those of Daniel and the Revelation, are about to reach their final fulfillment.
One prophecy which is of especial interest at this time is the prophecy concerning the Beast power in Revelation, and the Mark of this Beast. The Bible tells us that all who live on the planet will be required to receive the mark of the beast and will finally be threatened with death if they refuse to comply. Have we come to the point where this prophecy is about to be fulfilled? Do present events indicate that things are in place for the implementation of this mark? In this booklet we will examine the evidence which shows that we are indeed at that place in time and that the Mark of the Beast or something closely related to it is about to be imposed on all of us. It is time to be certain that we are standing in Christ and in Him alone.
Let me say here at the beginning that this understanding of the prophecy is not an attempt to be dogmatic or to set these ideas in stone. When it comes to prophetic fulfillment, only God can be dogmatic. Only God knows the truth with absolute certainty. However, these ideas are here presented after careful and prayerful examination of the word of God, over a period of several years, with an attempt to reconcile them with current events. We believe that these ideas have solid biblical support and it is our hope and prayer that they will be a blessing to all who read, and that they will help us to be prepared for what is coming - no - for what is already upon us.
A brief overview
In Revelation chapter 13 two beasts are presented to us. One



2
of them, the first beast rises up out of the sea. This beast is the main subject of the prophecy. He has seven heads and ten horns and while he has the body of a leopard, he has the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion. On his head there is written the name of blasphemy. This beast receives a deadly wound which is healed and he makes war against God’s people for forty-two months. All who live on earth worship and praise him.
Later in this same chapter we see another power rising up out of the earth. This is the second beast who is later referred to as, “The “False Prophet.” He has two horns like a lamb, but he speaks like a dragon. This false prophet really works to focus the attention and the worship of the world upon the beast who came up from the sea. He commands the people who live on the earth to make an image of the beast, and he gives life to this image. He performs great signs and wonders in order to convince the people to make this image. He then arranges for everybody to receive the mark of the beast, or his name and number. Those who refuse are not able to buy or sell, and eventually they are sentenced to death. This false prophet is called a prophet, because he does miracles in order to promote the worship of the beast. In other words, the Bible presents him as being the prophet of the beast, the beast’s agent. but of course, he is a “false” prophet because he turns people to the beast, rather than to God.
A little later in Revelation chapter 17, we see the first beast again. This time it is being ridden by a woman, a great prostitute whose name is “Babylon.” In this chapter we are told that the seven heads of the beast represent seven mountains

and seven kings. Five of these heads have fallen, one presently exists and the seventh one has not yet come. The ten horns represent ten kings which will receive power after the seven heads are all gone.
After the seventh head passes away, the beast will become the eighth king. At this time the ten horns will receive power along with the beast and will give their strength and power to the beast. Through these ten horns the beast will destroy the woman Babylon. Although she has been riding the beast all along, at the end, the horns on the beast will turn against her and will destroy her. This same beast, along with the ten horns will also make war against Christ.
The same entity
There are some people who say that the beast of Revelation 13 and the beast in Revelation 17 represent two different powers. This is not true. The evidence demonstrates that both beasts are the same, even though they are described slightly differently in both chapters. Let’s take a look at the similarities between them:
1. They both have seven heads and ten horns. (Rev. 13:1; Rev. 17:3)
2. They both exist at the very end of time.
3. They both have the name of “blasphemy” written on their heads. (Rev. 13:1; Rev. 17:3)
4. They both fight against Christ and His people. (Rev. 13:7; Rev. 17:13,14)
5. The world wonders after both beasts. (Rev. 13:8; Rev. 17:8)
6. Both have a period when it seems that they disappear, but then they regain power. (Rev. 13:3; Rev. 17:8)
7. Both are worshipped by those whose names are not written in the book of life. (Rev. 13:8; Rev. 17:8)
The similarities are overwhelming. It is not possible that two such entities exist on the earth at the same time during the
Babylon riding the Beast

last days. No, it is the same beast being described in two different settings. Let us look at some more evidence that they are the same.
The Beast in Revelation 19
In Revelation 19:19,20, we find further evidence that the beasts of Chapter 13 and 17 are the same entity.
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. (Revelation 19:19-20)
Which of the beasts is this which we see here, making war against Christ? This is at the second coming of Jesus, verses 11-16 make this clear. Here the beast is, standing at the end of time and he, along with the kings of the earth, is making war against Christ. Is this the beast of Revelation 13, or the beast of chapter 17?
First of all, Revelation 17 tells us that it is the beast of chapter 17 who will make war against Christ, through the ten horns which give their power and strength to the beast.
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. (Revelation 17:12-14)
Can we see this clearly? Here we see the ten horns give their power to the beast in Revelation 17, then we are told that they will all “make war with the lamb.” This is exactly what we just saw happening in chapter 19, in the passage quoted above. We are told that Christ will overcome them because He is King of kings and Lord of lords. Notice the name by which He is called; this is the name seen written on the vesture of Christ when He returns to fight against the beast at the end of time. (Rev. 19:16). So there are clear indications that the beast seen in Revelation 19 battling against Christ at the very end is the same beast that we see the woman riding in Revelation 17. But is this a different beast from the beast of Revelation 13?



5
No, there is also unmistakable evidence which shows that this is the same beast as the one seen in chapter 13.
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. (Revelation 19:20)
This clearly refers to the beast and the false prophet from chapter 13. The beast is there with the false prophet who worked miracles “before him.” This is a clear reference to the two powers of Revelation 13, the sea-beast and the beast from the earth who did miracles in order to get people to worship him.
So the evidence is unmistakable which shows that the beast of Revelation 17 and the beast of Revelation 13 are the same beast.
Notice that the beast is simply referred to as “the beast.” It is taken for granted that we know who is being referred to. This is because there is really only ONE beast. It is “the beast,” it is not “a beast,” or “one of the beasts,” but simply, “the beast,” because there is only one. The one seen in chapter 13 and the one seen in chapter 17 is the same beast. There are not several beasts making war against God’s people at the end of time, there is only one, along with his friend, the false prophet.
A European composite
The next important thing we need to notice is that the beast is a European, or an Old-World power. The beast is said to have the feet of a bear, the mouth of a lion and the body of a leopard. This points us back to the four beasts which Daniel saw in his vision in Daniel 7. He saw a lion, a bear, a leopard and a great and terrible beast. These four beasts represented the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome. Here we see the same powers represented in this beast, but instead of representing



6
only these four empires, this beast has seven heads. He represents seven great empires, not just four. What we see in this beast is not one single political kingdom, but rather, one single satanic kingdom. We see Satan’s entire kingdom throughout the ages, Satan’s work against God represented in one symbol, the beast, with the seven manifestations of that kingdom represented by the heads on the beast.
This is why when we see Satan represented as the Dragon in Revelation 12, he also has seven heads and ten horns. These heads and horns represent the totality of his work against God throughout the ages, but since his agent is the beast, the beast also is represented as having seven heads and ten horns. These seven heads represent the seven great powers which Satan has used in his campaign against God and His people through the ages.
In Revelation 17:10 we are told that the heads represent seven kings (kingdoms/empires). But five have fallen, while one is, and the other has not yet come. So we can’t mistake the fact that the beast is a composite entity which spans different ages of time. At any given time, the beast had only one head. It has never had more than one head, but because God is representing it to us from beginning to end, he shows us all seven heads, even though at this point, five of them no longer exist and one has not yet arrived.
This conflict against God and His people was concentrated in Europe and the Middle East for close to four thousand years, from the time that God called Israel to be His people until Europeans discovered the New World and Christianity spread to the rest of the world.
The Kingdoms represented
From the time that God first called a people, Satan has tried to destroy them. The first great power which he used to try to destroy them was Egypt. Egypt enslaved God’s people for hundreds of years and in fact, eventually made a death-decree that all male children should be destroyed. Egypt was the first great enemy, for this reason, we believe that the first head of the beast represents Egypt.
The next great power used by Satan was Assyria. This kingdom destroyed Israel and took the ten tribes of the Northern kingdom, captive. Those tribes never returned to Israel and gradually became absorbed into the Gentile nations. What we call the Jews or physical Israel, today, is actually made up of the three tribes which remained, Judah, Benjamin and Levi.



7
The next powers which dominated, persecuted and subjugated God’s people were, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome. Rome persecuted both physical Israel, the Jews, as well as spiritual Israel, the Christian Church and in fact, this persecution continued with even greater fury when political Rome was replaced by religious Rome, otherwise known as the Papacy.
So the first six heads of the beast would represent, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome (in both its political and Papal form). The five fallen would be Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia and Greece. The one which is, of course, would be Rome. According to the prophecy there is to come another head, another empire which will last for a short space. One suggestion is that this seventh head represents the Papacy, as a separate and distinct power from political Rome, but this does not seem feasible. The Bible says that this head is to remain for a “short space.” The papacy continued to dominate Europe for longer than all the other empires combined, so it could not be said that it continued for a “short space.”
This suggests that another dominant power is to arise in Europe which will persecute God’s people for a brief moment of time, before the beast itself emerges as the eighth king, to take control of Europe through the ten horns. It is yet to be seen who this seventh head is. Of course we know that according to the prophecy of Daniel 2, there will never again be another universal empire after the iron kingdom of Rome. However, what we are looking at is another power arising for a brief moment to dominate and control Europe. A European power can never again be said to be a universal power, because since the last five hundred years, the world has grown to be much bigger than Europe. So what we expect is a seventh head to arise in Europe, to dominate it for a very short period of time. It will not maintain its position for we are told that the nations of Europe “shall not cleave one to another.” This power of course would arise in the divided Roman empire. We understand from Daniel chapters 2 and 7 that Rome, from one perspective, remains until the very end. However this prophecy suggests to us that within that divided Roman empire, one power is to arise and dominate for a very short period of time.
Some also suggest that this seventh head applies to the USA, but this is not possible because the USA is not an old world, or European power. In addition, the USA is represented as the twohorned beast or the false prophet and this power is seen at the end, fighting alongside the beast against Christ. Therefore, it is evident that the beast and the false prophet (the USA) are en



8
tirely different entities and the USA cannot be represented by any of the heads of the beast.
Religious or secular?
The Bible says that the Mark of the Beast crisis will result in the persecution of those who will not receive the mark. They will be unable to work, to buy or sell and eventually they will be sentenced to death. This situation seems very unlikely when we look at the world today, particularly in the developed countries, where freedom and democracy seem to be such highly cherished ideals. Hundreds of years ago in the days when kings and rulers had absolute power and could easily execute any of their subjects who dared oppose them, such a situation as the Mark of the Beast crisis was easy to imagine, but not today. Today, even the death sentence has been abolished in most first world countries and democracy seems to be so well established that it does not seem possible for people to be killed over a religious belief. But the Bible says it will happen.
The only kind of system which can implement the Mark of the Beast crisis described in Revelation 13 is a totalitarian system of government which completely dominates the lives of the citizens. For a government to so control its citizens as to be able to make a death decree over a point of worship is amazing. We see examples of this kind of system in only two kinds of societies in the world today. One is extreme Islamic societies where religious laws are strictly enforced. People are sometimes executed just for breaking the simplest of these religious rules. The other example is societies where there is extreme, Marxist communism. There again the state completely dominates and controls the lives of the people so that all dissidence is punished severely, sometimes by death.
These are not the kinds of systems which exist in the democratic societies of Europe and the West today. But if the Bible is to be fulfilled, this is what MUST develop in every country in the world. The question is, will it be on the basis of religion, as in Islamic countries, or will it be on the basis of atheism, as in communist countries? We have always believed that this final tyrannical system would be a global religious dictatorship, but does the prophecy really support this idea?
From the Bottomless Pit
The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition ..... (Rev 17:8)
We are told that the beast disappears for a while. When he



9
reappears he is said to “ascend from the bottomless pit.” What does this mean?
The phrase, “The bottomless pit,” appears in Revelation in four places. It is actually translated from a word which might be literally translated as “the abyss.” What is the meaning of this phrase? What idea does God want to bring to our minds when we see this phrase?
In Revelation 9:1,2 terrible creatures with the power to torment humanity are said to arise from this pit. In Revelation 20:1,2, Satan is said to be bound in this pit for a thousand years. In Revelation 11:8 and in Revelation 17:8 the beast is said to arise from this pit, when he appears for the final time. The use of the phrase in all these situations leads to the conclusion that this “bottomless pit,” is not a literal place, but rather, refers to a spiritual state. It implies a state where there is no hope, a state of utter godlessness and spiritual darkness. These are the conditions from which the beast will arise for the final conflict. It is when world conditions become utterly godless, when the knowledge of God has been all but eradicated from human society, when the spirit of God is almost completely grieved away from the human race that this utterly godless beast system will reappear in his true form. Thus he is said to arise from the “bottomless pit,” a spiritually hopeless state.
This suggests of course that when the beast arises for the final time, it will be divorced from all religion, a power which is purely atheistic. Satan had always used religious, or religio-political powers to persecute God’s people, but here we see a new manifestation of Satan’s work - something not seen before. Pure atheism, without any religious component. This is what the Beast from the bottomless pit is, a godless, purely atheistic power.
The woman destroyed by the Beast
In Revelation 17:16, 17 we find further support for this idea that when the beast re-appears for the final time, he is an anti

religious power.
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. (17) For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. (Rev 17:16-17)
These ten horns give their power and strength to the beast. Then through these ten horns, the beast destroys the woman, Babylon. This Babylon represents the great system of false religion which presently dominates the world. The ten horns, “eat her flesh, make her naked and burn her with fire.” Since this beast (through the horns) destroys false religion (Babylon) and then fights against Christ and His people, it cannot itself be a religious power because obviously, it hates both false and true religion. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this last enemy of God’s people will be an atheistic, godless entity.
So the indications are very strong that the final enemy of God’s people standing at the end, will not be a religious power, but rather, a totally godless entity. False religion (Babylon) will work with the beast until close to the end, but during the last moments of time, the beast will destroy her.
Fulfilled by Communism
During the last 100 years atheistic communism has emerged as a system of government which has demonstrated the willingness to kill millions of its subjects, for no reason other than that those citizens disagreed with its philosophies. Many of those who were thus killed simply wanted to practice their religious beliefs without hindrance.
In the communist regimes of China, Russia, Korea and Cambodia, tens of millions have been killed simply because they disagreed with the policies of their governments. If such a system should become universally established, then it is not difficult to see that terrible persecutions could be directed at people

11
simply because of their religious beliefs. The prophecies suggest that this will be the nature of the final great enemy of God’s people. It will be “the beast from the bottomless pit,” a power which is wholly Satanic, atheistic, humanistic and determined to wipe out the knowledge of God from this planet.
Present developments
As we look at what is developing in the world today, we see indications of a rapidly growing totalitarian, atheistic, socialistic one-world system of government. Not so much a religious entity, but a secular one. Interestingly, today Europe is the most atheistic continent in the world. According to Nigel Barber, Writing in the May, 2010 edition of Psychology Today,
“belief in God declines in more developed countries and is concentrated in Europe in countries such as Sweden (64% nonbelievers), Denmark (48%), France (44%) and Germany (42%).”
Europe is also the most atheisstic, socialistic continent and is the place where totalitarian communism had its first and most firmly established footing. Many observers today see a clear trend where Europe is returning to the totalitarian system of communism, but under a different name and taking a different route than that of force and compulsion.
Blasphemous symbols of the European Union
One of the striking evidences which points to Europe as being a major participant in this approaching crisis, is the amazing symbols which the European Union has adopted to represent its effort to unify Europe.
Here for example is a drawing, representing the EU, which has the slogan, “Europe: Many tongues, one voice.” What is startling is the drawing which accompanies this slogan. It very clearly depicts the biblical tower of Babel, the place where God scattered the human race and confounded the languages of humanity. God scattered the Babel-builders because He saw that in their centralization there was the potential for unlimited power and that it would contribute to their defiance of God



12
European Parliament Building
and the perverting of His purposes for humanity. The European Union, in choosing the tower of Babel to go along with their logo, is saying in the plainest possible way, “we defy God, we reverse what you established.” It is one thing to seek to unify Europe; it is another thing altogether to choose as the symbol of that unity something which deliberately contradicts God. Only a bare-faced, godless, blasphemous power would defy God in this blatant way.
The European Parliament building has been also designed along the same lines as the tower of Babel. Here we see a photograph of the building. It is easy to see the intention behind the design. This is another uncanny example of the link between Europe and the Beast power of Revelation.
The next picture shows yet another symbol which has been chosen by the European Union to illustrate its attempt to become one united entity. It is a picture of a woman riding a bull.
One has to ask, is it by design or is it by accident that there is so much in this picture which mirrors the symbolisms in Revelation? The woman seems to have an uncanny resemblance to the woman, Babylon, seen in Revelation 17, riding the scarletcoloured beast. If this resemblance is by accident, then there is surely a supernatural hand behind the scene manipulating and directing Europe in its choice of symbols. But if it is by design, then surely the EU has to be the most blatantly blasphemous system of human government on the planet, because this would mean that it has deliberately chosen (again) to represent itself by a sym



13
bol which identifies it as a great enemy of God.
The American image
Even more frightening is the fact that the same kind of system of government is rapidly developing in the United States of America. America is creating an “image of the beast,” which according to the prophecy will exercise all the power of the first beast (Europe). We see this being rapidly fulfilled before our eyes.
Many are living under the illusion that the United States of America is the bastion of freedom, a democratic nation where each citizen is guaranteed the freedoms and rights which are basic to all human beings. This may have been true a hundred years ago, but not anymore. Today, America is a different country. The teachings of evolution permeate the education system and the nation is taught that God has no place in a modern, science-oriented society. Respect for God is no longer a feature of American society and as atheism and secularism take control, there is a corresponding decline in morality and freedom.
Every day there are reports of some new measure by the government which encroaches more and more on the rights of the people.
In the name of anti-terrorism and human rights, the government assumes greater and greater control of the people. The activities of citizens are closely monitored every moment, every financial transaction, every phone call, every email. People are encouraged to spy on their neighbours and to report any unusual activities to the authorities. There are laws in place which allow state agencies to detain people indefinitely without needing to charge them with any crime. Some of these draconian measures have been present in other countries for decades, but were unthinkable in America twenty years ago.
It is evident that America is rapidly setting up the image of the beast. The last crisis is approaching at lightning speed.



14
How Will
The Mark Develop?
The implications of a mark
The main purpose of a mark is identification. It is a means of distinguishing between one person or persons, and all others. The first time that a mark is mentioned in the Bible is in connection with Cain, the first murderer. In Genesis 4:15 we are told that God placed a mark upon Cain in order to protect him. Cain was afraid that somebody would kill him in retaliation for his murdering Abel, but God placed this mark upon him as a means of safeguarding him from random attack.
In Revelation 13 we read that all who dwell on the earth will be commanded to receive a certain mark, referred to as, “The Mark of The Beast.” The purpose of this mark is to clearly identify those who cooperate with the system by worshiping the beast, and to clearly distinguish between them and those who are opposed to the beast and his system.
Obviously then, the mark must be something clearly discernible. It must draw a dramatic and clear line of demarcation. There can be no room for ambiguity. This is the purpose of a mark; this is the reason why people are commanded to receive the mark. It is a way of making a clear distinction between two groups of people.
Underlying characteristics
The mark of the beast will be something implemented by the state, a requirement imposed on all the people by the governing power. Therefore, it is evident that in this mark of the beast issue, the principles of the state must clash with religious principle. The state will not defend anything but itself, and Christians will not die for anything but religious principle. Somehow, in the mark of the beast crisis, both these things have to be involved. On the part of the state, it will be a determination to defend and impose the authority of the government, while on the part of those who refuse the mark it will be a determination to be true to their commitment to God. So the mark of the beast has to be an issue which from the government’s side, is a politi



15
cal issue, a social issue, while from the Christian’s side, it is a moral issue.
Obviously, this issue cannot be something which is relatively minor. For the government it is a critical issue, to the point where a death decree becomes necessary. The position of those who resist comes to be regarded as a serious, threat against something greatly valued by the powers that be. To the Christian it is so important that the threat of death will not cause him to give in.
We can see also that it must be a clearly defined issue, so well defined that it brings great polarity and a head-on conflict with severe penalties. A vague issue cannot rise to such proportions.
It has to be a crisis of such a nature, of such critical implications that it justifies, in our “free” world, the death penalty for failure to comply with the state. This kind of treatment is normally only reserved for treason.
This suggests an issue which involves life and death, as serious as murder, (the only crime for which a death penalty is currently acceptable),
Either that, or it means that there has to be the development of a global system of government, so tyrannical, so totalitarian that it will kill en masse, those who resist it, even for relatively minor issues.
This is an amazing scenario! What could cause the governments of the world to come to such a place? One possible reason is that they may see a certain group of people as a threat to political stability. The issue about which governments are most paranoid is the question of “national security.”
Maybe the issue which causes rage and the death sentence is not the magnitude of the crime, but the unyielding nature of the resistance. (this is how it has been in communist countries where any resistance is viewed as critical and something to be crushed). It is not the crime which is the issue, but the fact of the resistance.
There will be a way to paint the resistance as treason, as “hate crimes.” In some way the opposer will come to be regarded as an enemy of the state. Such a crisis will come because the world reaches a place where the state is supreme. It not only wields supreme power, but comes to be regarded as being legitimately entitled to our supreme worship and allegiance.
What can we learn from history?
The record of the past reveals the way the future conflict will



16
develop. The Caesars of Rome saw Christianity as a threat because it threatened the stability of the empire. Not that the Christians were destructive or anti-social criminals, but that they destabilized the serenity of the established lifestyle, creating as it were, a state within a state. They were killed because they destroyed the concept that the state was the authority to be given supreme allegiance.
This has been the issue in EVERY SINGLE persecution of God’s people in the past. This will be the pattern in the Mark of the Beast crisis.
Developing areas of conflict
Already we can see clear areas of conflict. There are aspects of people’s lives into which the government has intruded and assumed control where it has no right to venture. These issues are time bombs waiting to explode because they create areas where the conscience of an individual may come in conflict with the state. Some of these issues are: 1. The State has the exclusive right to educate children.
2. The state has the exclusive right to determine what may acceptably be taught to your children (subjects such as evolution and homosexuality are routinely taught in schools without the knowledge or approval of parents).
3. The state has the right to dictate whether or not you punish your children.
4. The state has the right to determine what is morally acceptable.
5. The state owns the rights to your body (the right of vaccination, the right to impose medical treatment etc.)
6. The state has the right to determine who you meet with in your own home.
Excuses for tighter measures
It is not difficult to see the cords being drawn tighter as governments assume greater and greater control over the citizens. Governments claim that these measures are necessary and that they are for the good of the citizens and particularly for the good of the state. What is happening is that individuals are becoming less and less important while the state becomes the god whom everyone must bow to and worship. These are the conditions which will prevail when the mark of the beast is enforced. The following issues are being used as excuses for the ever-increas



17
ing control which the government exercises over the people. a. Immigration control
b. Drugs control
c. Health safety
d. Human rights
e. Civil rights
f. Gun and crime control
g. Genocide intervention.
h. National security
i. Money laundering
j. Tax evasion
No stabilizing factor
The world has passed through many stages, many crises during its past 6000 year history. However, one thing has always been a factor in every single age of this planet’s existence and it was the fact that men always acknowledged the presence and the authority of a higher power called “God.” Even in the most barbaric and distorted perceptions which men had of God, the acknowledgement of a supreme being whose counsel was to be respected always limited the hands of rulers, to some extent. Even if the ruler himself cared nothing for God, the fact that his subjects feared some divine being and regarded His authority as being greater than even that of the king, made rulers cautious about going too far.
Today, however, we have finally come to the place where the knowledge of God has been all but erased from the upcoming generation of humans. Satan has achieved his master plan by establishing the teaching of evolution in schools. The young people of today have a much greater disrespect and contempt for religion and God, than any previous generation ever had. The teaching of evolution in the schools has done its sinister work and we are about to see for the first time what it is like to live in a world where men do not believe in God. With God out of the picture, all we are left with to govern us is human wisdom. This is a frightening prospect. Man really knows nothing, in spite of the fact that evolutionists label man as “homo sapiens” (man the wise one). Mankind is groping in the dark, experimenting with things which he knows nothing about, conducting genetic experiments, teaching children that homosexuality is normal, messing with the environment, redefining morality. When these



18
experiments begin to bear fruit as they are already doing, the only cure for this world will be to utterly destroy it and start over again.
The Microchip
One of the factors which has always made the Mark of the Beast crisis seem like an unlikely fantasy, is the fact that there has never been a system of state control which could implement the kind of total control which the Bible describes. We are told that every person on the earth, “rich and poor, free and bond, small and great,” will be commanded to receive this mark of the beast and that nobody will be able to buy or sell unless he has the mark. How will the beast-government enforce such a law? How will the state be able to control trading and monitor all forms of it so closely that certain individuals will be completely excluded?
Up until a few years ago, these were the kinds of questions which made the mark of the beast crisis seem like an impossibility. Not anymore. Today, technology has exploded beyond man’s wildest dreams. It is now possible for governments to monitor the activities of citizens almost every second of every day. With the advent of the internet, cell phone technology, microwave and satellite communications, it is very difficult for any human being to hide these days if the powers that be wish to keep tabs on him. Most countries already require each citizen to be identified by a number, whether it is called a “Social Security Number,” or an “Identification Number,” or a “Tax Registration Number.” In order to obtain a passport or a driver’s license, each citizen must be registered in a database which contains critical information about his identity and location among other things.
Now with the advent of the microchip, finally, the technology has been perfected whereby every person can be constantly monitored night and day. Most of us are aware that the microchip is a tiny computerized chip, encased in unbreakable glass about the size of a grain of rice. There is growing demand for citizens to have this chip implanted inside their bodies, possibly somewhere in the hand or arm.
The microchip is a wonderful invention which has great possibilities. On the surface, it appears to be a great idea to have this chip implanted in every person. The microchip could contain all the information necessary to identify a person and to allow him to carry out any transaction. Think about it, there would no longer be any need for a person to carry a wallet, credit card, driver’s license, passport, or any form of identification. All this



19
information would be contained in a single tiny chip embedded beneath the skin in a convenient place available to be scanned any time there was the need to identify a person or to do business with him. In addition to this, it would be a simple matter to find a person who was lost if such a person had the chip implanted in his body.
For governments it would be a dream come true. It would make cash unnecessary. People doing business would simply need to transfer credit from chip to chip. Money laundering, drug transactions and tax evasion would be very difficult. It is easy to see why governments would like to have the chip implanted in all citizens. The challenge is that many people are violently opposed to the idea of any system which would allow the government to have such intimate knowledge of their affairs. However, the growing cry for greater security, the rise of crime and terrorism has gradually made people more willing to give up their freedoms in the name of safeguarding themselves. More and more people are willing to believe that greater control by the government is a good thing since they believe it is the only way to control crime and terrorism.
This is what will open the door to the introduction of the microchip as compulsory for every person on earth. If not the microchip, then some technology very similar. The point is, that for the Mark of the Beast to become a reality there has to be a system in place which enables the governments of the world to have absolute control over the finances, the buying and selling, the trading of its citizens, some way to completely control their financial dealings, some way to closely monitor their every activity. The microchip technology provides such a system. Finally, the world is ready technologically, for the Mark to be instituted.
We should note that there is nothing morally wrong with the microchip itself. In and of itself the microchip is a great idea and a great invention. It is the potential which exists for it to be used to totally control the lives of people which is the problem. In other words, having a microchip implanted in one’s body would not in and of itself be a sin. The microchip is NOT the mark of the beast. However, the point is, it provides the technology necessary to implement and enforce the mark. It is not the microchip which is the problem, but the use which will be made of it.
An image to the beast
What is the “image of the beast?” Revelation 13:13-15 tells us that the two-horned beast which came up out of the earth commanded those who dwell on the earth to make an image of the



20
beast and that he had power to give life to this image of the beast.
This indicates that in the New World chiefly represented by the United States, a system of government will be set up which resembles and functions after the same pattern as the system of government which exists in the first beast (Europe). This does not mean that a system of government is to be established which has seven heads and ten horns, but rather, it suggests that a system is to be set up in the Americas which will have the following characteristics:
• A union of more than one country (possibly America, Canada, Mexico)
• A secularized, godless government.
• A state in which morality has been expelled.
These are the characteristics of the first beast a system of government which we already see developing in Europe. A secular, atheistic, totalitarian type of government. According to the prophecy, America will make an image of this system. We can expect to see the same kind of government develop there as exists in Europe.
Worship is the issue
According to Revelation, everybody must worship the image or be killed:- It is interesting that the word “worship” is used. Worship is a unique experience, it suggests supreme allegiance of body, soul and spirit. It suggests unconditional submission. It may imply admiration, but not necessarily. This is what all are required to give to this image of the beast. It is a condition where the state takes the place of God (as in communism).
Everybody who lives in the new world must submit to the system of government, on pain of death, must accept its philosophy regardless of conscience. This, effectively, is worship.
Mark, Name or Number
When we read Revelation 13 carefully, it seems that not everybody will necessarily receive the Mark. Each person receives either the Mark, OR the name, OR the number of the beast. All will not necessarily receive the mark, but must have some other form of loyalty to the beast, either the number or the name. What is the difference between these three things, the mark, the number and the name?



21
The Mark
A mark in this context is a means of identification (Ezek. 9:46), it is a means of distinguishing one set of persons from another. When we read the book of Revelation we should be aware that it is primarily a book of symbols. The pictures and images which we see there are not intended to be taken literally (for the most part), but should be interpreted by applying a meaning to the symbol. The mark then does not necessarily signify a literal mark, some outward symbol, tattoo or stamp, as many people believe. What it signifies is some means by which one set of people can be differentiated from the others.
God condemns the receiving of the Mark of the Beast. In Revelation 14:9-12 He states that His wrath will be poured out without mixture upon those who receive this mark. This suggests that this Mark of the Beast is some sin which is highly offensive to God. In addition it suggests that those who receive it have set themselves to deliberately defy Him, which is the reason why the punishment is so harsh. So we can be sure that this mark is not simply something as superficial as the placing of a tattoo or a stamp somewhere upon a person’s body. It must involve the conscience and the heart. It must involve some behaviour, some commitment to something which is clearly a blatant sin, something which is obviously wrong, but which has been embraced by those who receive this mark.
This mark is received either in the forehead or the right hand. What does this mean? It suggests that this distinguishing characteristic may be seen either in how a person thinks (forehead), or in the things which he does (right hand). So there must be some system established which will make it demonstrable what everyone is either thinking or doing. This system must be highly efficient in identifying those who conform and those who don’t because it will be a matter of life and death.
The Name
For a long time I had no clue as to what the name of the Beast was. I read various theories, but recently I was studying again and the answer which came to me was so simple that it was almost ludicrous. It seems amazing that I can’t recall ever hearing this answer before.
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. (Rev 13:1)



22
There it tells you; upon the heads of the beast is the name of “blasphemy.” It says the same thing in Revelation 17:3. There, in plain sight is the name of the beast. His name is “blasphemy.”
A name in the Bible often was used to express the character of the individual so named. Several times in the Bible a person received a new name when his character changed or as a result of some unusual experience which he had. Two examples of this are Abram whose name was changed to Abraham, and Jacob whose name was changed to Israel.
So when the Bible speaks of the name of the beast, it is referring to the character, the nature of the beast. The nature of this beast is that it is a godless, atheistic power which has as its chief identifying characteristic, the attitude of blasphemy. Not all receive the Mark of the Beast; some will receive his name or his number. This suggests that there are those who will have the same nature and character as the beast power, that is, they will manifest the same godless atheism as the beast and so, will have his name.
The Number
What do numbers signify in the Bible? Two numbers which come to mind are the numbers seven and twelve. These numbers come up very often in connection with God’s operations. The seventh day, the seventh month the seventh year, the seven plagues, the seven trumpets, the seven seals the seven churches etc. We also see the twelve tribes, the twelve apostles and multiples of this number such as the 24 elders (12x2) and the 144,000 (12x12). What we can see is that the numbers seven and twelve represent God’s pattern of operation. It represents the principle on which God carries out His activities in the earth and among His people.
When we apply this idea to the number of the beast we see that the number of the beast, 666, represents the pattern of operation of the beast. It describes the principle underlying the dominance of the beast in the earth
As we mentioned before, when studying the book of Revelation we find many clues to interpreting it by looking at the Old Testament passages which use the same language and speak of the same things. The book of Revelation is written in the language and symbolism of the Old Testament. When we apply this rule to the number of the beast we find something interesting. According to Revelation 13:18, the number of the beast is the number of a man and “his number is Six hundred threescore and six.” When we search through the Bible to find that same



23
phrase, we find it only one other place in the Bible. It is found in 1 Kings 10:14, where it says:
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, (1 Ki 10:14)
This is very interesting. In the days of Solomon, Israel attained to the pinnacle of its glory. It was the highest point to which man could attain in terms of worldly glory and the Bible measured it in terms of gold, or finances. The mark of the Beast issue will be enforced by controlling the finances of the entire planet. People who are out of harmony with the system will not be allowed to buy or sell.
The financial system, then, represents “man’s number,” and signifies the highest point to which humanity can attain, apart from God. This is the absolute truth. Take God out of the picture and what is it that drives and motivates humanity? It is always the desire for wealth, glory, and power. This is the ultimate as far as the goals of humanity are concerned; it can rise no higher without God.
Today, evolutionary atheism has all but driven the knowledge of God out of modern society. Evolution is taught in schools as fact, while it is forbidden to pray or to mention the name of God. Along with this change there has come a different value system than existed one hundred years ago. Today, money is everything. Anything is justified in the name of financial gain.
So those who receive the number of the beast are those who are wrapped up in the financial system of the beast-controlled planet, those who are driven by the same motivation of worldly gain. For this reason they embrace the philosophies and ideals of the beast and in this way, they are said to have received the number of the beast.
Underlying the implementation and reception of the mark of the beast, will be the underlying motive of financial gain. This system is implemented and imposed upon the entire planet because some people will profit from it. This is the bottom line; this is the number of the beast: Money.
From persecution to execution
When the mark of the beast is first implemented, it will be a peaceful procedure. Like the passing of all laws it will go through the process of discussion, assessment and finally implementation. This is when the trouble will start. Why will it escalate to the place where there is persecution, where there are arrests and ultimately, a death decree?



24
It has to be that there is resistance of such a nature that it threatens to undermine the state. Governments will not normally persecute people unless they feel threatened. Usually, governments feel threatened when there is fomenting rebellion and insurrection. In this case, this cannot be the issue because the target is Christians and Christians do not foment insurrection.
This resistance of Christians comes from the fact that they stand for some Christian principle which is diametrically opposed to the government’s policy, thus drawing the ire of the government. So the government must very forcefully promote and establish some practice which will be accepted by all its citizens, but which will be adamantly rejected by Christians.
Furthermore, it must be a practice which is of such a nature that many professing Christians (those who do not truly know Christ), will feel at liberty to cooperate with the government and reject God’s counsel on this matter. It has to be an issue which, though glaringly black and white, is of such a nature that black is presented as white and white is presented as black and is wholeheartedly accepted by the vast majority of the world. It may also be a matter of such a nature that it produces an attack on the Bible and may even lead to the Bible being outlawed as “hate literature.”
Authority is the issue
The question still remains, what would happen to make such a seemingly innocuous issue escalate to the point of life and death where the countries of the world resort to killing their citizens in order to obtain full conformity in this matter?
It cannot be the issue itself. It must be that the issue escalates to the place where it becomes a matter of the authority of the state being seriously threatened or undermined.
Obviously the state will push it aggressively. The Christian community will push back aggressively (what else can we do?). The consequence is that the irresistible force meets the immovable object. Something has to give. The nature of the state (prodded by Satan) is to ensure that its authority is not resisted. Moreso when the principles of atheism and communism have infected the nations. Communism has already murdered tens of millions for no crime other than the crime of resisting the state. This is the spirit which governs atheistic communism.
It is not a question of how massive the issue will be, that is of little consequence. The real question is, what kind of government system are we looking at in the image of the beast? This



25
is the real issue. When the system becomes atheistic and communistic, then opposition of the state will not be tolerated. Disagreement with the state will be treated as rebellion against the state, as “war against the beast,” and this will be treated as treason, punishable by death.
The interesting thing is that the masses of society will admire and support the beast in this. They will wonder at the beast, worship the dragon and the beast and ask, “Who is like the beast, who is able to make war with him?” Obviously this question is referring to Christ and His people.



26
The Mark
of Sodom
Previously we suggested that the final great enemy of God’s people on this planet will be a godless, atheistic power which will destroy false religion and make war against Christ and His people. It is clear that the Papacy plays a major role in the persecution of God’s people and the development of the apostasy which matures in the last moments of time. However, it is also clear that the Papacy is itself destroyed by this final enemy before Christ returns.
All who read the book of Revelation are aware that the last great crisis on this earth will revolve around something called, “The Mark of the Beast.” Everybody will be commanded to receive a certain mark or else lose the privilege of being able to buy or sell and eventually face the threat of death. (Rev. 13:17)
Recently I was startled by the realization that there is an issue presently facing the world which is growing with lightning speed and which already displays many of the characteristics which we associate with the Mark of the Beast. Strangely, this particular issue has not aroused a lot of alarm in religious circles. Here are 13 characteristics of this issue: 1. It is brazen defiance of man against God. 2. It is an attack upon God’s authority as Creator. 3. It attempts to compel all humanity to defy God. 4. It is being imposed on all nations by economic pressure. 5. People are losing their jobs if they refuse to support it. 6. People are being refused the right to trade if they reject it. 7. It is a universal issue - not just affecting one group of people, but all who live on the earth. 8. It is pushed on all ages and classes (including children). 9. It is gradually being accepted by Christian churches and groups. 10. It is dividing the world into two camps. 11. It is primarily established by the “beast” kingdom. (Europe) 12. It is promoted by the second beast (the USA)



27
13. It is a mark of godlessness (atheism)
Just look at this list for a moment and ask yourself, what current issue is there which fulfills all the specifications of this list? It should not be too hard to identify because there is only one thing in the world which presently fulfills these points.
I am referring to the “Gay” or the homosexual movement. Every one of the 13 points mentioned above is presently being fulfilled by this movement.
The gay movement already is the most universal and brazen attack upon God’s principles and therefore upon God Himself, that the world has ever witnessed. It is Satan’s masterpiece, for there is no better way to obliterate the image of God in man and to debase humanity to a place lower than beasts than to propagate this unnatural, sinful practice and to ensure that it is pushed on the entire human race. Satan has had great success in pushing this agenda. It is the fastest growing movement on the planet and there is no other issue which is so forcefully imposed on all nations so aggressively.
This is the first case in history where the governments of the entire world have undertaken to deliberately and by universal law, overturn the government, values and laws of God. This is an attack upon one of the institutions established in Eden, the other being the Sabbath. An attack upon these two things is an assault upon God’s credentials as Creator.
The mark of godlessness.
This is very interesting when we realize that the Bible specifically identifies homosexuality as the mark of godlessness. It is the sin which takes over a society when people reject God. It is the sin which is most closely linked with atheism. In Romans 1:21-28 the apostle Paul tells us:
For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him. Instead, their thoughts turned to worthless things, and their senseless hearts were darkened. Though claiming to be wise, they became fools ... For this reason, God delivered them to sexual impurity as they followed the lusts of their hearts and dishonored their bodies with one another. They exchanged God’s truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason, God delivered them to degrading passions as their females exchanged their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural. In the same way, their males also abandoned their natural sexual function toward females and burned with



28
lust toward one another. Males committed indecent acts with males, and received within themselves the appropriate penalty for their perversion. Furthermore, because they did not think it worthwhile to keep knowing God fully, God delivered them to degraded minds to perform acts that should not be done. (Romans 1:21-28, ISV)
Here God tells us that when a society rejects Him, He leaves them to themselves. The consequence is that people begin to turn to all kinds of perverted practices. The main corruption which takes place is that homosexuality becomes prominent in the society. Without God, the society becomes morally diseased and men and women begin to burn with lust for members of their own sex. So the increase of homosexuality in a society is directly related to the rejection of God by that society.
This is exactly what we see happening today in the developed countries of the world. These nations which have been blessed by God with prosperity and stability have turned to the philosophies of evolution and humanism. God has been driven out of these societies for the most part and atheism is running rampant in these countries. Not surprisingly homosexual behaviour has also become well established and widely accepted as normal activity.
In Ezekiel 16:49, 50, God identifies the reasons which led to Sodom’s destruction:
Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good. (Ezekiel 16:49-50)
Sodom was a wealthy society which became proud and idle. In spite of her riches, she did not help the poor and needy. What was the result of this kind of lifestyle? God says, “They committed abomination before me.” This is why God destroyed Sodom. Her affluent, idle and selfish lifestyle resulted ultimately in the adoption of abominable practices, the chief of which was homosexuality.
The same situation prevails today in those countries which are foremost in accepting homosexuality and promoting “gay” marriage. They are the wealthiest countries which are full of sports, games and parties, basking in their prosperity while they ignore the hunger and need which exist in other parts of the world where hundreds of millions perish for want of the basic



29
necessities of life. Look at this list of countries where homosexual marriage is legal and we will see that these are primarily the wealthier countries of the world.
Thirteen countries (Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden) allow same-sex couples to marry nationwide, while New Zealand and Uruguay will allow it from August 2013. Same-sex marriages are also performed and recognised in Mexico City, Quintana Roo, and parts of the United States. Some jurisdictions that do not perform same-sex marriages but recognise it being performed elsewhere include: Israel, Aruba, Curaçao and Saint Maarten, and Mexico. Australia recognises same-sex marriages only if one partner has had gender reassignment therapy (Source: Wikipedia)
We may also now add New Zealand and the UK to the list with others to follow shortly. The same exact conditions of Sodom are replicated in these developed countries, pride, fullness of bread and an abundance of idleness. God says that these were the conditions which led to Sodom turning to “abominations.” As we look at what is happening in the world today we see a striking parallel. Today’s world is following the course of Sodom in a way which can only be described as “uncanny.” Clearly, the judgments of God cannot be far away.
There is an interesting article Published in the May 18, 2010 online issue of Psychology Today, entitled, “Why Atheism will Replace Religion.” The points made in this article are revealing. The author, Nigel Barber, writes:
“.... Belief in God declines in more developed countries and (atheism) is concentrated in Europe in countries such as Sweden (64% nonbelievers), Denmark (48%), France (44%) and Germany (42%). In contrast, the incidence of atheism in most sub-Saharan countries is below 1%.
“Atheists are more likely to be college-educated people who live in cities and they are highly concentrated in the social democracies of Europe. Atheism thus blossoms amid affluence where most people feel economically secure.
“In social democracies, there is less fear and uncertainty about the future because social welfare programs provide a safety net and better health care means that fewer people can expect to die young. People who are less vulnerable to the hostile forces of nature feel more in control of their lives and less in need of reli



30
gion.
“In modern societies, when people experience psychological difficulties they turn to their doctor, psychologist, or psychiatrist. They want a scientific fix and prefer the real psychotropic medicines dished out by physicians to the metaphorical opiates offered by religion.
“.... sport psychologists find that sports spectatorship provides much the same kind of social, and spiritual, benefits as people obtain from church membership. In a previous post, I made the case that sports is replacing religion. Precisely the same argument can be made for other forms of entertainment with which spectators become deeply involved.
“.... with better science, and with government safety nets, and smaller families, there is less fear and uncertainty in people’s daily lives and hence less of a market for religion. At the same time many alternative products are being offered, such as psychotropic medicines and electronic entertainment that have fewer strings attached and that do not require slavish conformity to unscientific beliefs.” (Why Atheism Will Replace Religion - by Nigel Barber, Phd.)
This is an accurate, but depressing picture of the state of the world. The wealthier a society becomes, the greater the technological development, the more the knowledge of God diminishes. The more educated a society becomes, the less belief there is in God. This is obviously because the educational system of today is specifically designed to create skepticism about God. The theory of evolution has become so deeply entrenched into the thinking of the developed world that the idea that God created all things is considered a sign of illiteracy and mental deficiency. The writer of the article stated quite confidently that “there are strong correlations between atheism and intelligence.”
If the present trend of “development” in the world continues uninterrupted for a few more years, the brave new world without God, which the atheists predict, will become a reality.
The Bible tells us that the world will come to this place where conditions produce an utterly godless (atheistic) kingdom; the beast from the bottomless pit will dominate the planet. But it is wonderful to know that God predicted all this many centuries ago and that He also told us how it all would end. The beast will be thrown into the lake of fire along with his pal the false prophet. Atheism will not win, though it may seem to do so for a short



31
time. God will intervene finally, decisively and put an end to the blasphemy which envelops the planet.
In the streets of Sodom
There is still more evidence which suggests that this final conflict will revolve around the homosexual movement. In Revelation 11:8 we see that the beast from the bottomless pit arises and kills God’s two witnesses. God tells us that these witnesses are killed in the streets of a great city.
And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. (Revelation 11:7-8)
Notice how God identifies the city. It is called, spiritually, “Sodom,” and “Egypt.” It also represents the place where Christ was crucified. What is implied by the name, “Egypt?” Egypt stands out as the place where there was the most open defiance of God ever manifested. When Moses delivered God’s message to Pharaoh instructing him to let the children of Israel go, Pharaoh responded,
“.... Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.” (Exodus 5:2).
Egypt thus becomes symbolic of a condition where God is denied and rejected in the most defiant way. This is a striking reference to modern atheism.
The place where the witnesses are killed is also referred to as “Sodom.” There is hardly any need to question what is being referred to here. Sodom has been synonymous with the sin of homosexuality from the days of Lot until today. Therefore the



32
Bible is telling us that a kingdom which is purely atheistic will attack God’s witnesses at a time when the condition of the world is predominantly atheistic and riddled with homosexuality.
This condition is further identified as the place where Christ was crucified. Jerusalem, at the time of Christ’s crucifixion was a city which had rejected God and was about to suffer divine wrath. Again, this identifies the condition of the world at the time when the beast arises from the bottomless pit. The world has so rejected God that the spiritual condition of humanity in general is similar to that of Jerusalem at the time when the nation crucified Christ. So this last enemy of God’s people, the beast from the bottomless pit, is a power which may be described as an atheistic, Sodomite!
Symbols of end-time conditions.
When He spoke of the end of the world and His second coming, Jesus said it would be as “the days of Noah,” and as “the days of Lot.” (Luke 17:26-28). These civilizations are the only ones represented in the Bible as having been destroyed by God’s own personal intervention. In both cases, the Bible declares that the wickedness of these societies had reached a place where God could no longer allow them to continue.
In the case of Sodom, the Bible tells us plainly that they “committed abominations” (Ezek. 16:50). Jude tells us that they went after “strange flesh” and consequently suffered the vengeance of eternal fire. There can be no question as to the reason why God destroyed that society.
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; (21) I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. (Gen 18:20-21)
God sent two angels with the express purpose of assessing Sodom and Gomorrah in order to demonstrate whether or not they were really as wicked as was reported. The angels were given lodging in the home of Lot and what happened that night demonstrated that the Sodomites really had reached the point of no return.
The record in Genesis tells us that all the men of the city came to the house of Lot and demanded that he send out two men who had come to visit with him, in order that they might have sex with them. Not knowing that these men were angels, these evil men of Sodom spent an entire night trying to get hold of them in



33
order that they might sodomize them. Let us note that this was the breaking point, the last straw which demonstrated that Sodom really was ripe for destruction. According to what God said to Abraham, the angels had been sent to investigate Sodom’s condition. That night they had their answer. It was the last night of Sodom’s existence. The following morning God destroyed the city with fire and brimstone.
The behaviour which demonstrated that Sodom was at the point where it was fit for destruction was the universal perversion which filled the entire culture. Homosexuality had become the natural thing for all the men of Sodom. They “went after strange flesh.” When we see the same conditions replicated today, we should be aware that there can only be one consequence. The end of this world is at hand.
But God also said that the days of Noah were an example of how it would be at the end of the world. In Genesis chapter 6, the Bible tells us that in the days of Noah, the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continually.
I was startled recently when I learned that according to the Talmud (the writings used by the Jewish Rabbis to interpret the Scriptures 1000 years before Christ was born), the only time in human history when men were writing marriage contracts, getting married to other men, was in the days of Noah, just before the flood! This is very interesting when we realize that the only two civilizations directly destroyed by God were Sodom and the antediluvian world. The outstanding practice of both these cultures at the time when they were destroyed by God was the practice of homosexuality!
As we see the rapid increase of homosexuality in the world today and the widespread acceptance of homosexual marriage, can we doubt that we have come finally, at last to the very end of time?



34
Truth turned upside-down
Perhaps the question might be asked, “Why is this sin in particular regarded as being so abhorrent? Are not all sins the same in God’s sight? What would make God less tolerant of this particular sin above others? Are not murder, rape, adultery, fornication etc. equally rampant in society today? Why pick out homosexuality as being so significant?
Well first of all, it is God who identifies same sex relations as being an abomination and who demonstrated His acute displeasure at its practice in the destruction of Sodom and the antediluvian world. It is He also who shows us in Romans chapter 1, that homosexual practice is the prominent sin which arises in a society when it rejects the knowledge of God.
Besides, most other sins are easily explainable as natural expressions of normal human nature. They are not acceptable, but they are normal to human nature and it is only by resisting our natures that we avoid practicing them. Homosexuality on the other hand, is an unnatural practice. It perverts the design of the human body and misuses the functions for which that body has been clearly designed. Satan has succeeded in mocking and defacing the image of God in a most brazen way in getting the world to embrace this unnatural sin. It is an amazing reality that there is no practice which is so blatantly wrong, yet so wholeheartedly accepted by the world. Homosexual practice is contrary to nature, it is contrary to God’s word, it is contrary to reason, it is contrary to the testimony of history, yet it is being forcefully pushed on the entire planet! It is clear that this is Satan’s masterpiece in his plan to get the whole world to defy and mock God.
Let us not be mistaken; God loves homosexuals and wants to save each one of them as much as He wants to save any sinner. But before the sinner can receive God’s grace he must first acknowledge his need of it. He must recognize that he is a sinner with a problem which needs God’s grace to fix it. God’s grace is sufficient to heal all who are infected with this disease of homosexuality, but such a person must accept that he has a problem! He must accept that his homosexual practice is abhorrent to God and that he has to cease this practice, then he will be able to receive Christ’s strength to escape from this sin.
But the problem is, the homosexual movement today, has all but convinced the entire planet that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality. Those who think it is a sin are regarded as backward, bigoted and narrow-minded. God declares very strongly that homosexuality is a sin - an abominable sin. Today’s society re



35
jects the counsel of God and declares that there is nothing wrong with it. Scientists go out of the way in a desperate effort to persuade us that homosexuality is a natural thing and that people are born homosexual, so of course, a homosexual is just another kind of human being. God says homosexual is a category of sin, but the world today says it is a category of human being.
In other words, homosexuality has become accepted as being just another variation of human being such as a different race, or a different skin colour or a different sex might be. The deception of false science has overturned the word of God so that now, homosexuality must be approached from a twisted, false scientific point of view rather than from the point of view of God, the one who created us all. More frightening is the fact that Christians are being persecuted for daring to state their religious convictions that homosexual practice is a sin.
Perverting the rainbow sign
Another indicator of the blasphemous nature of the homosexual movement is the hijacking of the symbol of the rainbow. The homosexual movement by some strange perversity has adopted the rainbow as its symbol. There could be nothing so totally inappropriate as this - to use the symbol of God’s covenant with the human race as a symbol of a movement which is deliberately defiant of His plainest proclamations. The rainbow first appeared in the sky after the flood of Noah. God set it in the sky and told Noah that it was a sign that He would never destroy the earth again with a flood. Every time the rainbow appeared, men would remember God’s promise, but they would also remember the evil conditions which caused the destruction of that world and hopefully, they would avoid repeating it.
It was not to be. Shortly after the flood, the Bible says that Noah got drunk and lay naked in his tent. His youngest son, Ham, saw his father lying there naked, and apparently did something to him. The Bible does not tell us clearly what Ham did to his father, but it says that when Noah awoke he knew what his son had done to him and consequently he cursed Ham’s descendants. The Jewish Talmud suggests that Ham’s crime was that he sodomized his father. This seems quite feasible because it had to be something of that nature so that when Noah awoke he would know what had happened.
God had destroyed the evil world which existed, but in Ham, the third son of Noah, the evil practices of that antediluvian world survived. Ham became the father of a race of people who carried on the practices and attitudes of the antediluvians and



36
it was not long before the evils of the pre-flood world had returned.
The tower of Babel was the first great apostasy after the flood. There, men set out to defy God. They founded a city and congregated together with the aim of reestablishing another great civilization similar to that which existed before the flood. God destroyed their city and their tower and confused their languages. But the seeds of that great false religious system established at Babel have survived right down to this day and the religion and philosophies of Babel are still to be found in the governments and religious systems of today. This is the legacy of Ham, the first person who reintroduced homosexuality after God destroyed an entire civilization where it was predominant.
Declaring their sin like Sodom
In Isaiah 3:9, God referred to the apostasy of Israel and said that “they declare their sin as Sodom.” Here God expresses the reality that the Sodomites were not only great sinners, but that they were brazen and barefaced in flaunting their sin in the face of God. They not only did what was wrong, but they gloated in doing it and pushed it in the face of others. This is exactly the spirit we see in the homosexual movement today. The adoption of the rainbow symbol is just one example of this brazen defiance of God. The fact is, God says that the practice of same sex relations is an abomination. The world today, as it were, is demanding that God apologize for His attitude. They are saying, “God, we will not change, it is you who need to repent for your rejection of homosexuality.”
Implicit in the rainbow symbol is the truth that while God will never destroy the world by a flood of waters again, the next time He will destroy it be fire. Every time the rainbow symbol is used in association with the homosexual movement, this is the striking message which is actually being presented.
An example
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. (Jude 1:7)
Jude says that Sodom is set forth as an example. An example of what? He says that because they went after “strange flesh,” they suffered the vengeance of eternal fire. This is the example we are given. It is a statement of what will happen when a society goes after “strange flesh.” Jesus says it is an illustration of



37
the last days, the implications are clear. In the last days, men will go after strange flesh (homosexual practice) Just like in the days of Sodom. The consequence will be the same. The society which practices it will suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.
The 3rd Angel and Sodom
In Revelation 14:9-11, we see an angel flying through heaven with a special message from God.
And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. (Revelation 14:9-11)
This message of course, relates to the “Mark of the beast,” crisis. As we examine this message we see something startling. It appears that this message is pointing us directly to what happened when God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah! This is pretty amazing and makes us wonder why nobody ever pointed this out before.
Look at these striking similarities between the destruction of Sodom and the final punishment of those who receive the mark of the beast. Firstly, here is what the Bible says about those who receive the Mark of the Beast: • They will be tormented with fire and brimstone.
• In the presence of the angels.
• The smoke of their torment goes up.
• Their punishment will be forever.
Let us be reminded again that when studying the book of Revelation, it is necessary to go back to the Old Testament to discover the meaning of the symbols used, for Revelation is written in the language of the Old Testament, using the places and events from that time in presenting its message. So we ask, which city in ancient times did God destroy with fire and brimstone in the presence of angels? There is only one such place in the history of the world. It was Sodom and Gomorrah
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brim



38
stone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; (Gen 19:24)
The city was destroyed in the presence of two angels who were specifically sent to destroy the city. Just as with those who receive the mark of the beast, they were tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the angels.
And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. (Gen 19:28)
Abraham saw the smoke of the country arising like the smoke of a furnace. Notice again that this is exactly what is promised for those who worship the beast and receive his mark. The smoke of their torment will rise up. This is another clear reference to Sodom and Gomorrah. It is evident that God wants us to look at what happened to Sodom as we try to understand this issue of the Mark of the Beast.
We also see that the smoke of their torment arises for ever and ever. Jude explains what this means when he tells us that Sodom suffered the vengeance of eternal fire (Jude 1:7). It does not indicate that Sodom is still burning today, but rather, that the destruction was total and irrevocable, something eternal. In the same way, those who receive the mark of the beast will suffer the fate of Sodom, final and irrevocable punishment, “for ever and ever”
So what we can see clearly is that the message of the third angel is pointing us to Sodom and Gomorrah. Can we miss the parallel? It is amazing that we have not seen it before, but there it is. The Mark of the Beast crisis is presented to us in the context of what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah.
The world today has become another Sodom and Gomorrah. The acceptance of homosexuality is being pushed aggressively upon the entire planet. Can this be related to the long-awaited and dreaded mark of the beast? It certainly is an issue which demands faithfulness from those who believe the Bible. The acceptance of homosexuality as a normal practice is being forced upon all who live on earth, small and great, rich and poor, free or bond. It is an issue which will clearly and decisively bring a clear line of separation between those who believe the word of God and those who do not. It is an issue which is already causing persecution and even the arrest of those who disagree with homosexuality and who dare to speak against it. It is not an issue which can be avoided because, not only are people being persecuted for speaking against it, but the acceptance of it is becoming a basis for acceptance, even when people apply for



39
jobs.
Let us not be naive about what is happening. Many Christians ask, “What does it have to do with me really? As long as I am not required to practice it, why should I be concerned if laws are made to legalize it? But let us not be deceived, it will not stop there. Already Christians are suffering persecution for taking a conscientious position with regards to this abomination. Consider the following incidents:
The rising tide
The homosexual movement has gained great momentum in the United States since the appointment of Barack Obama as president. When he was first elected as president, Obama stated unequivocally, “marriage is between a man and a woman.” In December 2010 he stated, “My feelings about this are constantly evolving, I struggle with this.” In May 2012 he said, “I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.” Then in January of 2013 he stated, “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law,” referring to homosexual marriage. Where is it all going to end? It is hard to say, but the prophecies suggest that things are not going to get any better until Jesus returns.
At the time of the writing of this article the United States Supreme court is considering a ruling concerning a bill referred to as DOMA, or “The Definition of Marriage Act.” This bill was signed into law in 1999 by then president Bill Clinton, and it defined marriage specifically as something limited to a man and a woman. Several parties have challenged the con



40
stitutionality of this bill. Four years ago the people of California voted to limit marriage only to men and women, or in other words, making same-sex marriage illegal. This bill was referred to as proposition 8. When the bill was overturned by the ruling of a judge, it caused much uproar and dissatisfaction in California and the case has been taken to the Supreme Court. Now Americans are awaiting a decision on this issue which will no doubt cause massive changes in American society. Many are hoping that the Supreme Court will not only overturn California’s proposition 8, but will return a verdict which will legalize homosexual marriage throughout the entire United States.
Shortly before the Supreme Court met to discuss the case, it seems that public figures and companies were falling over themselves in eagerness to express their support for gay marriage. In the space of a couple of weeks all the following came out and expressed their support, Bill and Hilary Clinton, Senators Rob Portman, Claire McCaskill, Bob Casey, among others. Some of them such as Rob Portman were reversing the position which they had previously publicly taken. One of the most surprising was Bill Clinton who urged the Supreme Court to strike down the very law which he himself had signed into effect, DOMA, claiming that he had made a mistake.
Groups such as the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) also expressed their support for gay marriage, along with over two hundred of the biggest companies operating in the USA, including Apple, Google, Facebook, Jetblue, Starbucks, Alcoa and



41
Amazon.
During the same period of time increasing pressure on the Boy Scouts Association finally led to the decision to lift the ban on homosexual members and for the first time in its history, the Boy Scouts finally agreed to accept openly gay boys as members. This follows the pattern established when the US military was opened up for the acceptance of openly gay men and women a couple of years ago, under the Obama administration’s initiative. Ominously, the Army reported this year that in 2012 there were 26,000 cases of same-sex assaults in the US army! A door has been opened and only God knows where it all will end.
Many people are of the opinion that this issue is a minor one, something which will not affect them. The attitude is, “it’s not really my business.” However, the indications are already here that no one will be able to ignore it for long.
In Denmark it is already illegal for any church to refuse to perform same-sex weddings. It does not matter what the stance of that church is towards the issue, by law, all churches must conform.
In Canada, Laws have already been passed which make it almost impossible for anyone to take a conscientious position opposing homosexuality. Bill Whatcott was fined $7500.00 by the Canadian Supreme Court for distributing two tracts critical to homosexuality and appealing to the Canadian public to keep children from being taught that it was normal. The court ruled that the tracts consisted of “hate speech” and stated that with regards to hate speech, one



42
could no longer make the excuse that he loved the sinner but hated the sin.
On January 10, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeals in Canada released an opinion holding that marriage commissioners in Canada could not refuse to perform same-sex “marriage” ceremonies on the grounds that doing so would violate their religious beliefs. The case arose after some marriage commissioners objected to performing samesex “marriage” ceremonies. The government asked the courts whether it would be lawful for the marriage commissioners to refuse to perform the ceremonies on the grounds that doing so would violate their religious beliefs. The court held that allowing marriage commissioners to refuse to perform same-sex “marriage” ceremonies would violate the “Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” because it “would violate the equality rights of gay and lesbian individuals.” “The Court held that accommodating the religious beliefs of marriage commissioners could not justify discrimination against gay and lesbian couples.” (ADF attorney Erik Stanley writing at Speak Up Movement / Church)
All over the world people have been persecuted and prosecuted for taking a conscientious position with respect to this gay movement.



43
In England and Hawaii, the Christian owners of small motels have been sued and fined for refusing to accept same-sex couples as guests. In the United States photographers and florists have been fined because they refused to cater to gay weddings. In the most recent case in Washington, Barronelle Stutzman, a lady who owns a flower business has been sued twice, once by the ACLU, and also by the state. Stutzman explained to the homosexual couple that she could not conscientiously cater for their wedding because of her relationship with Jesus Christ.
A recent brochure (May 2013) emailed to the US Department of Justice employees requires them to verbally affirm homosexuality regardless of their personal beliefs. The brochure was created as a resource from DOJ Pride, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees of the Department of Justice.
According to the brochure, employees are required to verbally affirm homosexuality and place pro-gay stickers in their offices.
“Don’t judge or remain silent,” the brochure says. “Silence will be interpreted as disapproval.”
Perhaps most frightening of all is the massive push to have all children indoctrinated into the idea that homosexual practice is normal and that it is bigoted and hateful to be against it. Books have been written and placed on the reading curriculum of children as young as the first grade; introducing them to the idea that homosexuality is a perfectly normal



44
way of life.
This issue above all others has resulted in widespread criticism of Christianity and the Bible. Homosexuals realize that there cannot be universal acceptance of homosexual practice as long as the Bible remains authoritative in the minds of people. Therefore homosexuals label the Bible as outdated, primitive, and hateful. In fact, finally a homosexual Bible has emerged! Available on Amazon (at present) for the price of $35.00 is the “Queen James Version.” A Bible specifically printed to support homosexuality. The cover is plain white with a rainbow coloured cross on the front. Inside, it is exactly the same as any King James Version of the Bible with one significant difference: All the verses which speak against homosexuality have been changed, so that this Bible has absolutely no criticism of homosexuality!
Is homosexuality the Mark?
Let me be very clear: Am I saying that homosexuality is the Mark of the Beast? The truth is, I am tempted to answer, “yes,” but when it comes to unfulfilled prophecy, it is unwise to be dogmatic. What I am saying is that the homosexual movement as it is progressing today, fulfills many of the specifications of the Mark of the Beast crisis. At the very least I believe it is powerfully connected with the issue.
Satan has raised up an issue where a moral question comes to each person as a human-rights issue. This is the guise under which the gay movement is being promoted - human rights. A Christian cannot agree with homosexual practice because for him, it is a moral issue, something condemned by God. But the state says it must be accepted, so it is the authority of the state, versus the conscience of the Christian. It is ultimately, God versus man. These are the critical ingredients of the final crisis.
The homosexual issue is perfectly suited to the crisis. It separates those who take a stand because of the word of God and loyalty to Him, from those who worship man and his wisdom. In what seems a minor matter of sexual preference, but which is rapidly dividing the world into two camps. One of the most striking things



45
is the fact that the third angel’s message, warning of the consequences of receiving the Mark of the Beast has a clear reference to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Is this pure coincidence? Did this reference just happen to get in there by accident, or was this deliberately designed by God? This is a critical question, because if God deliberately designed it this way, then we can be sure that He is telling us, “When you study the Mark of the Beast, look at what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah.”
Possible issues
Of course there are many different ideas as to what the Mark of the Beast really is. Some believe it will be the microchip, some like the Jehovah’s Witnesses believe it has something to do with loyalty to the state and the saluting of the flag. Seventhday Adventists generally believe it has to do with the observance of Sunday and that laws will be passed making Sunday observance compulsory for the entire world.
Time will tell if the present homosexual agenda has something to do with the Mark of the Beast, but already the issues related to it are strikingly similar to what we expect when the mark of the beast comes. It seems evident that every single person on the earth will soon have to take a stand as to what his position is on this issue. The real question is, where do you stand today, and where will you stand as this crisis intensifies?
There is only one answer to this impending conflict; it is the same as it has always been. Those who are God’s people will find their refuge and their strength in Christ, and in Him alone. We are facing an issue more terrible than anything we have ever heard of or seen. The Bible speaks of this time as being “a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation.” Jesus speaks of it as being, “great tribulation such as never was, nor ever shall be.” Nothing human can keep us in this time, not our money, not our discipline, not our friends, not our will power. All who live on the earth will worship the beast and receive his mark. The only thing which can keep us is a living relationship with Jesus Christ where He lives in us, and lives His life through us. All others will bow to the beast and worship him. All others will break when it comes down to the crunch.
We are living in serious times. May God keep us faithful to Him alone.
