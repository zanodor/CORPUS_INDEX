PREFACE AND
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
T
HE STORY BEHIND Black Athena is long, complicated and, I believe, sufficiently interesting as a study in the sociology of knowledge to deserve extended treatment; thus I can give only a brief outline of it here. I was trained in Chinese studies; for almost twenty years I taught about China and carried out research on both intellectual relations between China and the West at the tum ofthe 20th century and contemporary Chinese politics. After 1962, I became increasingly concerned with the war in Indo-China, and in the virtual absence of any serious scholarship on Vietnamese culture in Britain, I felt obliged to study it. This was both to contribute to the movement against the American repression there, and for its own sake as a fascinating and extremely attractive civilization that was at the same time both thoroughly mixed and entirely distinctive. Thus in many ways Vietnam and Japan - whose history I had also studied - have served as my models for Greece. In 1975 I came to a mid-life crisis. The personal reasons for this are not particularly interesting. Politically, however, it was related to the end of the American intervention in Indo-China and the awareness that the Maoist era in China was coming to an end. It now seemed to me that the central focus of danger and interest in the world was no longer East

Asia but the Eastern Mediterranean. This shift led me to a concern for Jewish history. The scatteredJewish components ofmy ancestry would have given nightmares to assessors trying to apply the Nuremburg Laws, and although pleased to have these fractions, I had not previously given much thoughtto them or toJewish culture. It was at this stage that I became intrigued - in a Romantic way - by this part of my 'roots'. I started looking into ancientJewish history, and - being on the periphery myself- into the relationships between the Israelites and the surrounding peoples, particularly the Canaanites and Phoenicians. I had always known that the latter spoke Semitic languages, but it came as quite a shock to discover that Hebrew and Phoenician were mutually intelligible and that serious linguists treated both as dialects of a single Canaanite language. During this time, I was beginning to study Hebrew and I found what seemed to me a large number of striking similarities between it and Greek. Two factors disinclined me to accept these as random coincidences. First, having studied Chinese,Japanese and Vietnamese as well as a little Chichewa - a Bantu language spoken in Zambia and Malawi I realized that this number ofparallels is not normal for languages without contacts with each other. Secondly, I now realized that Hebrew/ Canaanite was not merely the language of a small tribe, isolated inland in the mountains of Palestine, but that it had been spoken all over the Mediterranean - wherever the Phoenicians sailed and settled. Thus there seemed to me no reason why the large number ofimportant words with similar sounds and similar meanings in Greek and Hebrewor at least the vast majority of those which had no Indo-European roots - should not be loans from Canaanite/Phoenician into Greek. At this stage, led by my friend David Owen, I became heavily influenced by the works of Cyrus Gordon and Michael Astour on general contacts between Semitic and Greek civilizations. Furthermore, I was convinced by Astour that the legends concerning the foundation ofThebes by the Phoenician Kadmos contained a kernel of truth. Like him, however, I dismissed the legends of Egyptian settlement either as complete fantasy or as cases of mistaken identity, believing that - whatever the Greeks had written - the colonists had really been Semitic speakers.



xiv BLACK ATHENA
I worked along these lines for four years, and became convinced that anything up to a quarter of the Greek vocabulary could be traced to Semitic origins. This, together with 40-50 per cent that seem to be Indo-European, still left a quarter to a third of the Greek vocabulary unexplained. I hesitated between seeing this irreducible fraction conventionally as 'Pre-Hellenic' or ofpostulating a third outside language, either, from Anatolian or - as I preferred - Hurrian. When I looked into these languages, however, they provided virtually no promising material. It was only in 1979, when I was glancing through a copy ofCerny's Coptic Etymological Didionary, that I was able to get some sense of Late Ancient Egyptian. Almost immediately, I realized that this was the third outside language. Within a few months I became convinced that one could find plausible etymologies for a further 20-25 per cent of the Greek vocabulary from Egyptian, as well as the names for most Greek gods and many place names. Putting the Indo-European, Semitic and Egyptian roots together, I now believed that - with further researchone could provide plausible explanations for 80-90 per cent of the qreek vocabulary, which is as high a proportion as one can hope for in any language. Thus there was now no need for the 'Pre-Hellenic' element at all. At the beginning ofmy research I had had to face this question: Why, if everything is as simple and obvious as you maintain, has nobody seen it before? This was answered when I read Gordon and Astour. They had seen the East Mediterranean as a cultural whole, and Astour had demonstrated that anti-Semitism provided an explanation for the denial of the role of the Phoenicians in the formation of Greece. After hitting upon the Egyptian component, I soon became even more acutely involved in the problem of,why hadn't I thought ofEgypt before?' It was so obvious! Egypt had by far the greatest civilization in the East Mediterranean during the millennia in which Greece was formed. Greek writers had written at length about their debts to Egyptian religion, and other aspects ofculture. Furthermore, I found my failure still more puzzling because my grandfather was an Egyptologist, and as a child I had been extremely interested in Ancient Egypt. Clearly there were very profound cultural inhibitions against associating Egypt with Greece.

PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS xv
At this point I began to investigate the historiography ofthe origins of Greece, to make sure that the Greeks had really believed they had been colonized by Egyptians and Phoenicians and had taken most of their culture from these colonies, as well as from later study in the Levant. Once again, I had a big surprise. I was staggered to discover that what I began to call the 'Ancient Model' had not been overthrown until the early 19th century, and that the version of Greek history which I had been taught - far from being as old as the Greeks themselves - had been developed only in the 1840S and 50S. Astour had taught me that attitudes towards the Phoenicians in historiography were profoundly affected by anti-Semitism; it was therefore easy for me to make a connection between the dismissal ofthe Egyptians and the explosion of Northern European racism in the 19th century. The connections with Romanticism and the tensions between Egyptian religion and Christianity took rather longer to unravel. Thus, one way and another, the scheme set out in Black Athena has taken me more than ten years to develop. During this time I have been a public nuisance in both Cambridge and Cornell. Like the Ancient Mariner, I have waylaid innocent passers-by to pour my latest halfbaked ideas over them. lowe these 'wedding guests' a tremendous debt, if only for their patient listening. I am even more grateful for the extremely valuable suggestions they made, which - although I have been able to acknowledge only a few ofthem - have been ofincalculable help to my work. Most important of all, I want to thank them for their excitement about the subject and for the confidence they gave me that it was not madness to challenge the authority of so many academic disciplines. They appeared to believe in what I was saying and they convinced me that although some of my ideas were probably wrong in particular, I was on the right track. lowe the experts a different kind ofgratitude. They were not simply in my way. I pursued them into their lairs and pestered them with requests for rudimentary information and explanations of the reasons behind their ideas or conventional wisdom. Despite the fact that I took up much of their valuable time and sometimes upset their most cherished beliefs, they were uniformly courteous and helpful, often going to considerable efforts on my behalf. The help of the 'wedding

guests' and the experts has been central and essential to the project. In many ways I see the whole thing as a collective rather than an individual effort. One person could not possibly have covered all the many fields involved. Even with this massive outside help, however, I have inevitably fallen short of the thoroughness one would righdy expect of a monographic study. Furthermore, I am fully aware that I have not understood or properly assimilated much ofthe best advice given to me. Thus none ofthe people mentioned below is in any way responsible for many errors of fact and interpretation the reader will find. Nevertheless, the credit for this work belongs to them. First, I should like to thank the men and women without anyone of whom I could never have completed this work: Frederic Ahl, Gregory Blue, the late and very much lamented Robert Bolgar, Edward Fox,
Edmund Leach, Saul Levin, Joseph Naveh, Joseph Needham, David Owen, and Barbara Reeves. In different proportions, they gave me the information, advice, constructive criticism, backing and encouragement that have been crucial for these volumes. All of them are exceptionally busy people and working on extremely important and fascinating projects oftheir own. I am more moved than I can say at the great amounts of time they spent on my work, which was often presented to them when it was at a very primitive level. I also want to thank the following men and women - and record my gratitude to those who are now dead - for the time and trouble they took to help me: Anouar Abdel-Malek, Lyn Abel, Yoel Arbeitman, Michael Astour, Shlomo Avineri, Wilfred Barner, Alvin Bernstein, Ruth Blair, Alan Bornhard, Jim Boon, Malcolm Bowie, Susan Buck Morse, Anthony Bullough, Carol Caskey, Alan Clugston, John Coleman, Mary Collins, Jerrold Cooper, Dorothy Crawford, Tom Cristina, Jonathan Culler, Anna Davies, Frederick de Graf, Ruth Edwards, Yehuda Elkana, Moses Finley, Meyer Fortes, Henry Gates, Sander Gilman, Joe Gladstone, Jocelyn Godwin, Jack Goody, Cyrus Gordon, Jonas Greenfield, Margot Heinemann, Robert Hoberman, Carleton Hodge, Paul Hoch, Leonard Hochberg, Susan Hollis, Clive Holmes, NicholasJardine,JayJasanoff, AlexJoffe, Peter Kahn, Richard Kahn, Joel Kupperman, Woody Kelly, Peter Khoroche, Richard Kline, Diane Koester, Isaac Kramnick, Peter Kuniholm, Annemarie Kunzl, Kenneth Larsen, Leroi Ladurie, Philip Lomas, Geoffrey

I should particularly like to thank the few among them who objected strongly to what I was trying to do but still knowingly and willingly provided very useful aid. I should like to express my deep gratitude to everybody at the Department of Government at Cornell who not only tolerated but encouraged my involvement in a project so far from the usual concerns of a government department. Equally, I should like to thank all at Telluride House for many years of hospitality and for the intellectual stimulus that led me to tum to my new field. I am also very grateful to everybody at the Society for the Humanities at Cornell, where I spent a very productive and happy year in 1977/8. lowe a deep debt to my publisher, Robert Young, for his confidence in the project and the constant help and encouragement he has given me. At the same time, I want to thank my editor, Ann Scott, for the huge amount of work she has put into this volume, her patience, and the sympathetic way in which she has vasdy improved the quality ofthe text without bruising my amour propre. I am deeply indebted to the two scholarly readers, Neil Flanagan and Dr Holford-Strevens, and the copy-editor, Gillian Beaumont. I can assure the readers that the many errors, inconsistencies and infelicities still lurking in this book are nothing to those abounding in the text before it came under their expert scrutiny. Despite the frustrations of their Augean task, they have been extraordinarily patient and charming in all their dealings with me. I should like, too, to thank Kate Grillet for her first draft ofthe maps and charts and her extraordinary skill in interpreting my rushed and imprecise directions. I am also very grateful to my daughter, Sophie Bernal, for help with the bibliography and for her cheerful and patient gofering.



xviii BLACK ATHENA
lowe an incalculable debt to my mother, Margaret Gardiner, who gave me my basic education and self-confidence. More specifically, she has provided the means for me to complete this volume and has given valuable editorial help with the introduction. I should like to thank my wife, Leslie Miller-Bernal, for her useful judgement and criticism, but above all for providing the warm emotional base upon which so large an
intellectual undertaking is utterly dependent. Finally, I should like to thank Sophie, William, Paul, Adam and Patrick for their love and for keeping me so firmly rooted in the things that really matter.
TRANSCRIPTION
AND PHONETICS
EGYPTIAN
T
HE ORTHOGRAPHY USED in Egyptian words is the standard one accepted by modem Egyptologists, the only exception being the 3 used to represent the 'vulture or double )aleph', which is often printed as two commas on top of each other. Whatever the exact sound of the 3 in Old Egyptian it was transcribed into Semitic scripts as r, 1, or even n. This consonantal value was retained at least until the 2nd Intermediate Period in the 17th century Be. In Late Egyptian it appears to have become an >aleph and later, like the Southern English r, it merely modified adjacent vowels. The 3 is the first sign of the alphabetical order used by Egyptologists, and I shall continue with other letters with obscure or difficult sound values.
The Egyptian i corresponds to both the Semitic >aleph and yod. >Aleph is found in many languages, and nearly all Afroasiatic ones. It is a glottal stop before vowels, as in the Cockney 'bo>le' or 'bu>e' ('bottle'
and 'butter'). The Egyptian <ayin, which also occurs in most Semitic languages, is a voiced or spoken >aleph. The Egyptian form seems to have been associated with the 'back' vowels 0 and u.



xx BLACK ATHENA
In early Egyptian the sign w, written as a quail chick, may have had purely consonantal value. In Late Egyptian, the form of the language which had the most impact on Greek, it seems to have been frequently pronounced as a vowel, either 0 or u. The Egyptian sign written as r was more usually transcribed as I in Semitic and Greek. In later Egyptian it seems, as with the 3, to have
weakened into becoming merely a modifier ofvowels. The Egyptian and Semitic letters Romanized as I}. appear to have been pronounced as an emphatic h.
The Egyptian and Semitic b represents a sound similar to the ch in 'loch'. In later times it became thoroughly confused with the letter s.
The Egyptian letter h appears to have represented the sound by. It too became confused with s.
The letter written here as s was transcribed as either s or z. swas pronounced as sh or skh. In later times it became very confused
with bandh· represents an emphatic k. Inconsistently, I have followed the common practice of Semitists and have employed q to represent the same sound in Semitic.
The letter twas probably originally pronounced as tY• However, even in Middle Egyptian it was being confused with t.
Similarly, the gwas frequently alternated with d.
EGYPTIAN NAMES
Egyptian divine names are vocalized according to the commonest Greek transcription - for example, Amon for )1mn.
Royal names generally follow Gardiner's (196 I) version ofthe Greek names for well-known pharaohs, for instance, Ramesses.
COPTIC
Most of the letters in the Coptic alphabet come from Greek and the same transcriptions are used. Six extra letters derived from Demotic are transcribed as follows:
lY s qf
TRANSCRIPTION AND PHONETICS xxi
SEMITIC
The Semitic consonants are transcribed relatively conventionally. Several ofthe complications have been mentioned above in connection with Egyptian. Apart from these, one encounters the following:
In Canaanite the sound b merged with I}.. Transcriptions here sometimes reflect the etymological brather than the later I}.. t is an
emphatict. The Arabic sound usually transcribed as th is written here as tY• The
same is true of the dh/dY• The letter found in Ugaritic which corresponds to the Arabic Chain
is transcribed g. The Semitic emphatic k is written q, rather than as in Egyptian. The Semitic letter Tsade, almost certainly pronounced ts, is In Hebrew from the I st millennium BC the letter Shin is written as s. Elsewhere, however, it is transcribed simply as s, not as s, because I question the antiquity and the range of the latter pronunciation (Bernal, forthcoming, 1988). This, however, causes confusion with Samekh, which is also transcribed as s. Sin is transcribed as s.
Neither dagesh nor begadkepatis indicated in the transcription. This is for reasons ofsimplicity as well as doubts about their range and occurrence
in Antiquity.
VOCALIZATION
The Masoretic vocalization ofthe Bible, completed in the 9th and lOth centuries AD but reflecting much older pronunciation, is transcribed as
follows:
Name ofsign Plain with' y with,w with iT h ba
Qdmq ba bft bah
/fireq :;1 bi ':;1 bi
:;} be ':;} be iT:;} beh
segol i) be beh /folem bo t:l bo boh
QjbU!j bu btl



xxii BLACK ATHENA
The reduced vowels are rendered: :p be q 1)a
Accentuation and cantillation are not normally marked.
GREEK
The transcription of the consonants is orthodox. 1) is transcribed as y.
q 1)0.
The long vowels Tl and ware written as e and 0, and where it is significant the long a is rendered a. Accentuation is not normally marked.
GREEK NAMES
It is impossible to be consistent in transliterating these, because certain names are so well known that they have to be given in their Latin forms Thucydides or Plato - as opposed to the Greek Thoukydides or Platon. On the other hand, it would be absurd to make Latin forms for little-known people or places. Thus the commoner names are given in their Latin forms and the rest simply transliterated from Greek. I have tried wherever possible to follow Peter Levi's translation ofPausanias, where the balance is to my taste well struck. This, however, means that many long vowels are not marked in the transcription of names.

INTRODUCTION
Almost always the men who achieve these fundamental inventions ofa new paradigm have ez'ther been very young or very new to the field whose paradigm they change.
(Thomas Kuhn, The Structure ofScientific Revolutions, p. 90)
M
y USE OF THIS QUOTATION from Thomas Kuhn is an
attempt to justify my presumption, as someone trained in Chinese history, to write on subjects so far removed from my original field. For I shall be arguing that although the changes of view that I am proposing are not paradigmatic in the strict sense of the word, they are none the less fundamental. These volumes are concerned with two models of Greek history: one viewing Greece as essentially European or Aryan, and the other seeing it as Levantine, on the periphery of the Egyptian and Semitic cultural area. I call them the 'Aryan' and the 'Ancient' models. The 'Ancient Model' was the conventional view among Greeks in the Classical and Hellenistic ages. According to it, Greek culture had arisen as the result of colonization, around 1500 BC, by Egyptians and Phoenicians who had civilized the native inhabitants. Furthermore, Greeks had continued to borrow heavily from Near Eastern cultures. Most people are surprised to learn that the Aryan Model, which most of us have been brought up to believe, developed only during the first half of the 19th century. In its earlier or 'Broad' form, the new model denied the truth of the Egyptian settlements and questioned those of the Phoenicians. What I call the 'Extreme' Aryan Model, which



2 BLACK ATHENA
flourished during the twin peaks of anti-Semitism in the 1890S and again in the 1920S and 30s, denied even the Phoenician cultural influence. According to the Aryan Model, there had been an invasion from the north - unreported in ancient tradition - which had overwhelmed the local 'Aegean' or 'Pre-Hellenic' culture. Greek civilization is seen as the result ofthe mixture ofthe Indo-European-speaking Hellenes and their indigenous subjects. It is from the construction of this Aryan Model that I call this volume The Fabrication ofAncient Greece
1785-1 985. I believe that we should return to the Ancient Model, but with some revisions; hence I call what I advocate in Volume 2 ofBlack Athena the 'Revised Ancient Model'. This accepts that there is a real basis to the stories of Egyptian and Phoenician colonization of Greece set out in the Ancient Model. However, it sees them as beginning somewhat earlier, in the first half ofthe 2nd millennium BC. It also agrees with the latter that Greek civilization is the result ofthe cultural mixtures created by these colonizations and later borrowings from across the East Mediterranean. On the other hand, it tentatively accepts the Aryan Model's hypothesis of invasions - or infiltrations - from the north by Indo-European speakers sometime during the 4th or 3rd millennium BC. However, the Revised Ancient Model maintains that the earlier population was speaking a related Indo-Hittite language which left little trace in Greek. In any event, it cannot be used to explain the many non-Indo-European elements in the later language.
IfI am right in urgingthe ooerthrow oftheAryanModel and its replacement by the Revised Ancient one, it will be necessary not only to rethink the fundamental bases of'Western Civilization' but also to recognize the penetration ofracism and 'continental chauvinism' into all our historiography, or philosophy of writing history. The Ancient Model had no major 'internal' deficiencies, or weaknesses in explanatory power. It was ooerthrownfor external reasons. For 18th- and 19th-century Romantics and racists it was simply intolerable for Greece, which was seen not merely as the epitome ofEurope but also as its pure childhood, to have been the result of the mixture of native Europeans and colonizing Africans and Semites. Therefore the Ancient Model had to be ooerthrown and replaced by something more acceptable.
INTRODUCTION 3
What is meant here by 'model' and 'paradigm'? The value of defining such terms is limited, both by an unavoidable looseness in their use and by the fact that words can be defined only by other words, providing no bedrock upon which to build. Nevertheless, some indication of their intended meaning is necessary. By 'model' I generally mean a reduced and simplified scheme ofa complex reality. Such a transposition always distorts, as the Italian proverb puts it - traduttore traditore, 'translator traitor'. Despite this, like words themselves, models are necessary to nearly all thought and speech. It should always be remembered, however, that models are artificial and more or less arbitrary. Furthermore, just as different aspects oflight are best explained as waves or particles, other phenomena can be fruitfully seen in two or more different ways; that is to say, using two or more different models. Usually, however, one model is better or worse than another in its capacity to explain the features of the 'reality' confronted. Thus it is useful to think in terms of competition between models. By 'paradigm' I simply mean generalized models or patterns of thought
applied to many or all aspects of 'reality' as seen by an individual or
community. Fundamental challenges to disciplines tend to come from outside. It is customary for students to be introduced to their fields of study gradually, as slowly unfolding mysteries, so that by the time they can see their subject as a whole they have been so thoroughly imbued with conventional preconceptions and patterns of thought that they are extremely unlikely to be able to question its basic premises. This incapacity is particularly evident in the disciplines concerned with ancient history. The reasons seem to be, first, that their study is dominated by the learning of difficult languages, a process that is inevitably authoritarian: one may not question the logic of an irregular verb or the function ofa particle. At the same time as the instructors lay down their linguistic rules, however, they provide other social and historical information that tends to be given and received in a similar spirit. The intellectual passivity of the student is increased by the fact that these languages have generally been taught during childhood. While this facilitates learning and gives the scholar thus trained an incomparable feel for Greek or Hebrew, such men and women



4 BLACK ATHENA
tend to accept a concept, word or form as typically Greek or
Hebrew, without requiring an explanation as to its specific function or origin.
The second reason for inhibition is the near, or actual, religious awe felt in approaching Classical orJewish cultures, which are held to be the founts of 'Western' civilization. Thus there is a reluctance to use 'profane' analogies to provide models for their study. The great exception to this has been in folklore and mythology where, since the time ofJames Frazer and Jane Harrison at the turn of the 20th century,
there has been considerable comparative work. Nearly all this, however, has stayed within the bounds set in the I 820S by the man who destroyed the Ancient Model, Karl Otfried Miiller. Miiller urged scholars to study Greek mythology in relation to human culture as a whole, but was adamantly opposed to recognizing any specific borrowings from the East. I When it comes to higher culture, there has been an even greater reluctance to see any precise parallels.
The situation is at its most extreme, however, in the realms of language and names. Since the 1840S Indo-European philology, or study of the relationships between languages, has been at the heart of
the Aryan Model. Then, as now, Indo-Europeanists and Greek philologists have been extraordinarily reluctant to see any connections between Greek - on the one hand - and Egyptian and Semitic, the two major non-Indo-European languages of the Ancient East Mediterranean, on the other. There is no doubt that ifEgyptian, West Semitic and Greek had been the languages of three important contiguous tribes in the modern Third World, there would have been extensive comparative study, after which most linguists would have concluded that they might well be distantly related to each other and that there had certainly been considerable linguistic and presumably other cultural borrowings among the three peoples. Given the deep respect felt for Greek and Hebrew, however, this type of crude comparative work is felt to be inappropriate.
Outsiders can never have the control of detail gained so slowly and painfully by experts. Lacking a full understanding of the background complexities, they tend to see simple-minded correspondences
INTRODUCTION 5
between superficial resemblances. This does not mean, however, that the outsiders are necessarily wrong. Heinrich Schliemann, the German tycoon who first excavated at Troy and Mycenae in the 1870S-, made a naive but fruitful conjunction of legends, historical documents and topography, showing that much as academics might like it to be so, the obvious is not always false. Another tendency among professionals is to confuse what I would call the ethics of a situation with its reality. While it is 'only fair' that the expert who has spent a lifetime trying to master a subject should know better than a brash newcomer, this is not always the case. The latter sometimes has the advantage of perspective; the ability to see the subject as a whole and to bring outside analogies to bear on it. Thus one encounters the paradoxical situation that while amateurs are usually unable to help scholarly advance within a model or paradigm, they are often the best people to challenge it. The two most important breakthroughs in Hellenic studies since 1850 - the archaeological discovery of the Mycenaeans and the decipherment of their script, Linear B were both made by amateurs: Schliemann, to whom I have just referred, and Michael Ventris, who was an Anglo-Greek architect. Yet the fact that fundamentally new approaches often come from the outside certainly does not mean that all proposals from this quarter are correct or helpful. Most are not, and are rightly rejected as cranky. Discrimination between the different types of radical challenge poses two difficult problems. Who should do it? How should it be done? Naturally, the first group to be consulted should be the experts. They have the knowledge necessary to assess the plausibility and use of the new ideas. If, as with Ventris' decipherment of Linear B, most of them accept one ofthese, it would be foolish to challenge their verdict. Their negative opinion, on the other hand, cannot be regarded with the same unqualified respect, for, while they have the necessary skills to make a judgement, they have a direct stake in the case. They are the guardians of the academic status quo and have an intellectual and often an emotional investment in it. In some cases scholars even defend their position with the claim that the heroic age of amateurs, which in their field was once necessary, is now over. Therefore, although their discipline was founded by nonprofessionals, the latter can no longer



i
6 BLACK ATHENA
contribute to it. However plausible the idea ofan outsider may appear, it is inherently impossible for it to be true. It is because of such attitudes that just as 'war is too serious a matter to be left to military men', informed lay, as well as professional, opinion is necessary to assess the validity of new challenges which have been rejected by the scholars concerned. Although the latter generally know better than the public, there have been cases that show the contrary. Take, for example, the idea of Continental Drift, first proposed by Professor A. L. Wegener at the end of the 19th century. Throughout much ofthe early 20th century the significance of'evident fits' between Africa and South America, the two sides ofthe Red Sea and many other coasts was denied by most geologists. Now, by contrast, it is universally accepted that the continents have 'floated' apart. Similarly the American populists' proposals, in the 1880s and 90S, to abandon the gold standard were denounced by the academic economists of the time as completely unworkable. In such cases it would seem that the public was right and the academics wrong. Thus, although professional opinion should be studied carefully and treated with respect, it should not always be taken as the last word. How should an informed layperson distinguish between a constructive outside radical innovator and a crank? Between a Ventris who deciphered a Cretan syllabary and a Velikovsky who wrote sequences of events and catastrophes completely at variance with all other reconstructions of history? Ultimately, a lay jury has to rely on its own subjective or aesthetic judgement. There are, however, some helpful clues. The crank - that is, someone with a coherent explanation, whose hypotheses do not quickly attract the interest ofthe academic establishment - tends to add new unknown and unknowable factors into their theories: lost continents, men from outer space, planetary collisions, etc. Sometimes, of course, this type of hypothesis is spectacularly vindicated by the discovery of the postulated unknown factors. For instance, the great Swiss linguist Saussure's mysterious 'coefficients' which he hypothesized to explain anomalies in Indo-European vowels were found in the Hittite laryngeals. Before this, however, the theory remained untestable and to that extent uninteresting. Less imaginative innovators, by contrast, tend to remove factors
INTRODUCTION 7
rather than to add them. Ventris took away the unknown Aegean language in which Linear B was supposed to have been written, leaving a direct juxtaposition between two known entities, Homeric and Classical Greek, and the corpus of Linear B tablets. Thus he instantly
created a whole new academic field. I maintain that the revival of the Ancient Model of Greek history proposed in these volumes belongs to this second category. It adds no extra unknown or unknowable factors. Instead it removes two introduced by proponents ofthe Aryan Model: (I) the non-Indo-Europeanspeaking 'Pre-Hellenic' peoples upon whom every inexplicable aspect of Greek culture has been thrust; and (2) the mysterious diseases of 'Egyptomania', 'barbarophilia' and interpretatio Graeca which, the 'Aryanists' allege, have deluded so many otherwise intelligent, balanced and informed Ancient Greeks with the belief that Egyptians and Phoenicians had played a central role in the formation of their culture. This 'delusion' was all the more remarkable because its victims gained no ethnic satisfaction from it. The removal ofthese two factors and the revival of the Ancient Model leaves the Greek, West Semitic and Egyptian cultures and languages in direct confrontation, generating hundreds if not thousands of testable hypotheses-predictions that if word or concept a occurred in culture x, one should expect to find its equivalent in culture y. These could enlighten aspects of all three civilizations, but especially those areas of Greek culture that cannot be explained by the Aryan Model. The Ancient, Aryan and Revised Ancient models share one paradigm, that of the possibility of diffusion of language or culture through conquest. Interestingly, this goes against the dominant trend in archaeology today, which is to stress indigenous development. The latter is reflected in Greek prehistory by the recently proposed Model of Autochthonous Origin.2 Black Athena, however, will focus on the competition between the Ancient and Aryan models. The 19th and 20th centuries have been dominated by the paradigms of progress and science. Within learning there has been the belief that most disciplines made a quantum leap into 'modernity' or 'true science' followed by steady, cumulative, scholarly progress. In the historiography of the Ancient East Mediterranean these 'leaps' are perceived to



I
8 BLACK ATHENA
have taken place in the 19th century, and since then scholars have tended to believe that their work has been qualitatively better than any that has gone before. The palpable successes of natural science during this period have confirmed the truth of this belief in that area. Its extension to historiography is less securely based. Nevertheless, the destroyers ofthe Ancient Model and the builders ofthe Aryan believed themselves to be 'scientific'. To these German and British scholars, the stories of Egyptian colonization and civilizing of Greece violated 'racial science' as monstrously as the legends of sirens and centaurs broke the canons of natural science. Thus all were equally discredited and discarded.
For the past hundred and fifty years, historians have claimed to possess a 'method' analogous to those used in natural science. In fact, ways in which the modern historians differ from the 'prescientific' ones are much less certain. The best of the earlier writers were selfconscious, used the test of plausibility and tried to be internally consistent. Furthermore, they cited and evaluated their sources. By comparison, the 'scientific' historians of the 19th and 20th centuries have been unable to give formal demonstrations of 'proof' or establish firm historical laws. Today, moreover, the charge of 'unsound methodology' is used to condemn not merely incompetent but also unwelcome work. The charge is unfair, because it falsely implies the existence of other methodologically sound studies with which to contrast it. Considerations ofthis kind lead to the question of positivism and its requirement of'proof'. Proofor certainty is difficult enough to achieve, even in the experimental sciences or documented history. In the fields with which this work is concerned it is out of the question: all one can hope to find is more or less plausibility. To put it in another way, it is misleading to see an analogy between scholarly debate and criminal law. In criminal law, since conviction ofan innocent person is so much worse than acquittal of a guilty one, the courts rightly demand proof 'beyond reasonable doubt' before a conviction can be made. But neither conventional wisdom nor the academic status quo has the moral rights of an accused person. Thus debates in these areas should not be judged on the basis ofproof, but merely on competitiveplausibility. In these volumes
INTRODUCTION 9
I cannot, and therefore do not attempt to, prove that the Aryan Model is 'wrong'. All I am trying to do is to show that it is less plausible than the Revised Ancient Model and that the latter provides a more fruitful framework for future research. 20th-century prehistory has been bedevilled by a particular form of this search for proof, which I shall call 'archaeological positivism'. It is the fallacy that dealing with 'objects' makes one 'objective'; the belief that interpretations of archaeological evidence are as solid as the archaeological finds themselves. This faith elevates hypotheses based on archaeology to a 'scientific' status and demotes information about the past from other sources - legends, place names, religious cults, language and the distribution of linguistic and script dialects. In these volumes it is maintained that all these sources must be treated with great caution, but that evidence from them is not categorically less valid than that from archaeology. The favourite tool of the archaeological positivists is the 'argument from silence': the beliefthat if something has not been found, it cannot have existed in significant quantities. This would appear to be useful in the very few cases where archaeologists have failed to find something predicted by the dominant model, in a restricted but well-dug area. For instance, for the past fifty years it has been believed that the great eruption on Thera took place during the ceramic period Late Minoan IB, yet despite extensive digging on this small island, no sherd of this ware has appeared below the volcanic debris. This suggests that it would be useful to look again at the theory. Even here, however, some pots ofthis type could still tum up, and there are always questions about the definition of ceramic styles. In nearly all archaeology - as in the natural sciences - it is virtually impossible to prove absence. It will probably be argued that these attacks are against straw men, or at least dead men. 'Modem archaeologists are much too sophisticated to be so positivist', and 'no serious scholar today believes in the existence, let alone the importance, of"race".' Both statements may be true, but what is claimed here is that modern archaeologists and ancient historians ofthis region are still working with models set up by men who were crudely positivist and racist. Thus it is extremely implausible to suppose that the models were not influenced by these ideas. This does



10 BLACK ATHENA
not in itself falsify the models, but - given what would now be seen as the dubious circumstances of their creation - they should be very carefully scrutinized, and the possibility that there may be equally good or better alternatives should be seriously taken into account. In particular, if it can be shown that the Ancient Model was overthrown for externalist reasons, its supersession by the Aryan Model can no longer be attributed to any explanatory superiority of the latter; therefore it is legitimate to place the two models in competition or to try to reconcile them.
At this point, it would seem useful to provide an outline ofthe rest ofthis introduction. In a project as large as the one I am trying to realize here, it is obviously helpful to give summaries ofarguments, together with some indications ofthe evidence provided to back them. It is for these reasons that I have included an outline of the chapters that make up this book. The problems involved in explaining my arguments clearly are compounded by the fact that my views on the larger context in which the topics of Black Athena are set sometimes differ from conventional wisdom. Therefore, I have written a very schematic historical background which sweeps across the Western Old World, over the last twelve millennia. This broad survey is followed by a historical outline of the 2nd millennium BC, the period with which Black Athena is largely concerned. This is provided in order to show what I think actually happened as opposed the other people's views on the subject.
Then comes the summary of the The Fabrication ofAncient Greece itself, which is followed by rather more detailed descriptions of the contents of the other two volumes of the series. The outline of the second, Greece European or Levantine?, is included here to demonstrate that a powerful case can be made for the revival ofthe Ancient Model in terms of the archaeological, linguistic and other forms of evidence available. I have written a rather more sketchy descrlpton of the intended contents ofVolume 3, Solving the Riddle ofthe Sphinx, in order to show the interesting results one can achieve through applying the Revised Ancient Model to previously inexplicable problems in Greek mythology.
INTRODUCTION II
BACKGROUND
Before outlining the topics covered in these volumes, it may be useful to give a general impression of my views on their historical background, especially where they differ from conventional wisdom. Like most scholars, I believe that it is impossible to judge between the theories of monogenesis and polygenesis for human language, though I incline towards the former. On the other hand, recent work by a small but increasing number ofscholars has convinced me that there is a genetic relationship between the Indo-European languages and those of the Afroasiatic language 'superfamily'.3 I further accept the conventional, though disputed, view that a language family originates from a single dialect. I therefore believe that there must once have been a people who spoke Proto-Afroasiatic-Indo-European. Such a language and culture must have broken up a very long time ago. The latest possibility would be the Mousterian period, 50-30,000 years BP (Before the Present), but it may well have been much earlier. The tenninus ante quem is determined by the far greater differences between Indo-European and Afroasiatic than those within them, and I believe that the break-up of the latter can be dated to the 9th millennium BC. I see the spread of Afroasiatic as the expansion of a culture - long established in the East African Rift Valley - at the end of the last Ice Age in the lOth and 9th millennia BC. During the Ice Ages water was locked up in the polar icecaps, and rainfall was considerably less than it is today. The Sahara and Arabian Deserts were even larger and more forbidding then than they are now. During the increase of heat and rainfall in the centuries that followed, much of these regions became savannah, into which neighbouring peoples flocked. The most successful of these were, I believe, the speakers of Proto-Afroasiatic from the Rift. These not only had an effective technique of hippopotamushunting with harpoons but also possessed domesticated cattle and food crops. Going through the savannah, the Chadic speakers reached Lake Chad; the Berbers, the Maghreb; and the Proto-Egyptians, Upper Egypt. The speakers ofProto-Semitic settled Ethiopia and moved on to the Arabian savannah (map I; chart I). With the long-term desiccation ofthe Sahara during the 7th and 6th



12 BLACK ATHENA
millennia Be, there were movements into the Egyptian Nile Valley from the west and east as well as from the Sudan. I also maintain - but here I am in a minority - that a similar migration took place from the Arabian savannah into Lower Mesopotamia. Most scholars believe that this area was first inhabited by Sumerians or Proto-Sumerians and was infiltrated by Semites from the Desert only in the 3rd millennium. I argue that during the 6th millennium Semitic speech spread with the socalled Ubaid pottery to Assyria and Syria, to occupy more or less the region ofSouth-West Asia where Semitic is spoken today (map 2). I see the Sumerians as having arrived in Mesopotamia from the north-east, at the beginning of the 4th millennium. In any event, we now know from the earliest texts that have been read - those from Uruk from c.3000 Be - that bilingualism in Semito-Sumerian was already well established.4 Few scholars would contest the idea that it was in Mesopotamia that what we call 'civilization' was first assembled. With the possible exception ofwriting, all the elements ofwhich it was composed - cities, agricultural irrigation, metalworking, stone architecture and wheels for both vehicles and pot-making - had existed before and elsewhere. But this assemblage, when capped by writing, allowed a great economic and political accumulation that can usefully be seen as the beginning of civilization. Before discussing the rise and spread of this civilization, it would seem useful to consider the break-up and separate development of the Indo-European languages. In the first half of the 19th century it was thought that Indo-European originated in some Asian mountains. As the century wore on this Urheimat, or homeland, shifted west, and it was generally agreed that Proto-Indo-European was first spoken by nomads somewhere to the north ofthe Black Sea. In the last thirty years, this has been generally identified with the so-called Kurgan Culture attested in this region in the 4th and 3rd millennia Be. Possessors of this material culture seem to have spread west into Europe, south-east to Iran and India, and south to the Balkans and Greece. The general scheme of expansion from Central Asia or the Steppes was developed before the decipherment of Hittite, the discovery that it was a 'primitive' Indo-European language, and the further recognition
INTRODUCTION 13
that there was a whole Anatolian linguistic family. I should mention that for linguists, 'Anatolian' languages do not include those like Phrygian and Armenian which, though spoken in Anatolia - modern Turkey are clearly Indo-European. The true Anatolian languages - Hittite, Palaic, Luvian, Lycian, Lydian, Lemnian, probably Etruscan and possibly Carian - present a number of problems for the conventional view of Indo-European origins (map 3). It is generally conceded that Proto-Anatolian split from Proto-Indo-European before the latter disintegrated. However, it is impossible to tell the length of time between the two events, which could be anywhere from 500 years to 10,000. In any event, the difference is sufficient to cause many linguists to make a distinction between Indo-European - which excludes the Anatolian languages - and Indo-Hittite, which includes both families
(see chart 2). If, as most historical linguists suppose, not merely Indo-European but Indo-Hittite began north of the Black Sea, how and when did speakers of the Anatolian languages enter Anatolia? Some authorities argue that this took place during the late 3rd millennium when, Mesopotamian sources indicate, there were barbarian invasions there. These invasions would seem much more likely to have been those ofthe Phrygian and Proto-Armenian speakers. It is almost inconceivable that a period ofa few hundred years, before the first attestation ofHittite and Palaic, would allow for the very considerable differentation between Indo-European and Anatolian and within the latter family. The archaeological record for the 3rd millennium is extremely spotty, but there is no obvious break in material culture that would fit such a major linguistic shift. Nevertheless, one should not rely too heavily on the argument from silence, and an influx of Anatolian culture during the
5th and 4th millennia cannot be ruled out. A more attractive possibility is the scheme proposed by Professors Georgiev and Renfrew.s According to this, Indo-European - I should prefer Indo-Hittite - was already spoken in Southern Anatolia by the makers of the great Neolithic cultures of the 8th and 7th millennia, including the famous one at Catal Hiiyiik in the plain of Konya. Georgiev and Renfrew propose that the language moved into Greece and Crete with the spread of agriculture around 7000 Be, when



BLACK ATHENA
archaeology suggests a significant break in material culture there. Thus a dialect of Indo-Hittite would have been the language of the Neolithic 'civilizations' ofGreece and the Balkans in the 5th and 4th millennia. It would seem convenient to accept the proposal ofthe American Professor Goodenough that the Kurgan nomadic culture was derived from the mixed agricultural system of these Balkan cultures and hence derived its language from them.6 In this way it is possible to reconcile the theories of Georgiev and Renfrew with those of orthodox IndoEuropeanists, by postulating that the Indo-European-speaking Kurgan culture spread back into the Balkans and Greece over an Indo-Hittitespeaking population.
The hypothetical expansion ofAfroasiatic with African agriculture in the 9th and 8th millennia BC, and of Indo-Hittite with that of SouthWest Asia in the 8th and 7th, would to some extent explain what seem to be fundamental differences between the north and south coasts of the Mediterranean. These migrations were largely overland because sea travel, though possible at least as early as the 9th millennium, was still risky and laborious. With the improvement ofnavigation in the 5th and 4th millennia, the situation was largely reversed. Despite the fact that nomads continued to migrate overland, particularly across plains, transport and communications from the 4th millennium BC until the development ofrailways in the 19th century AD were generally easier by water than by land. In this long period rivers and seas provided links, while territories were isolated by riverless deserts and mountains. Such a pattern of historical layering of first land, then sea, would explain the general paradox with which this book is concerned: the apparent contradiction between the striking cultural similarities found among populations all around the Mediterranean and the fundamentallinguistic and cultural division between the peoples of its south and north coasts.7
Civilization spread from 4th-millennium Mesopotamia with great speed. The idea of writing seems to have been taken up in India and many parts of the East Mediterranean even before its codification as cuneiform in its land of origin. We know that hieroglyphs were developed in the Nile Valley by the third quarter of this millennium, and despite the lack of attestation it would seem likely that Hittite
INTRODUCTION
hieroglyphs, as well as the prototypes of Levantine, Cypriot and Anatolian syllabaries, were formed before the arrival in Syria, near the beginning of the 3rd millennium, of fully fledged Sumero-Semitic civilization, with its regular cuneiform script. Egyptian civilization is clearly based on the rich Pre-dynastic cultures of Upper Egypt and Nubia, whose African origin is uncontested. Nevertheless, the great extent of Mesopotamian influence, evident from late Pre-dynastic and I st-dynasty remains, leaves little doubt that the unification and establishment of dynastic Egypt, around 3250 BC, was in some way triggered by developments to the east. The cultural mix was further complicated by the fundamental linguistic and, I would argue, cultural links between Egypt and the basically Semitic component of Mesopotamian civilization. The miraculous 4th millennium was followed by the prosperous 3rd. The newly discovered archives from Ebla in Syria, dating from around 2500 BC, portray a concert of rich, literate and sophisticated states stretching from Kurdistan to Cyprus. We know from archaeology that civilization at this time extended still farther - to the Harappan culture stretching from the Indus to Afghanistan, and the metalworking cultures of the Caspian, Black Sea and Aegean. The Semito-Sumerian civilizations of Mesopotamia were tightly bound by a common script and culture. Those on the periphery, though equally 'civilized', retained their own languages, scripts and cultural identities. In Crete, for instance, there seems to have been a considerable cultural influx from the Levant at the beginning ofthe ceramic period Early Minoan I, at the tum of the 3rd millennium. Nevertheless, cuneiform did not become the dominant script, and Crete was never fully incorporated into Syro-Mesopotamian civilization. Apart from sheer distance, the most plausible reasons for this would seem to be the resilience of the native culture and the fact that Crete was culturally between the Semitic and
Egyptian spheres of influence. This double relationship with both the Levant and Africa is reflected in archaeological discoveries. Many Syrian and Egyptian objects ofthis period have been found in Crete and other parts ofthe Aegean. Around 3000 BC, as in the Near East, copper began to be mixed with arsenic to make bronze; pots started to be wheel-made, and there are striking



BLACK ATHENA
similarities between fortification systems in the Cyclades and those of the same period found in Palestine. The archaeologists Professors Peter Warren in Bristol and Colin Renfrew in Cambridge ask us to believe that these developments took place independently, unaffected by the fact that the same changes had occurred somewhat earlier in the Near East and by the undoubted contacts between the two regions.8 I find this very implausible. It would seem much more likely that the Aegean developments took place as the result of contacts through Levantine trade and settlement and local initiatives in response to these stimuli. We know that most of the bronze-using world ofthe 3rd millennium was literate, either in cuneiform or in local scripts. There is, however, no trace of writing in the Aegean at this period. How seriously should 'the argument from silence' be taken in this case? There are some cogent points to be made against it. In the first place, the climates of Greece and Anatolia are far less suitable for preserving clay tablets and papyrus than those of the Middle East or North-West India.
Even in these dry regions, evidence is often hard to find. Until the discovery of tablets at Ebla in 1975, there was no evidence whatsoever ofliteracy in Syria during the 3rd millennium. We now know that Syria at that time contained a cultivated literary class and that men travelled from the Euphrates to study at the schools of Ebla. A further point suggests that there was writing in the Aegean during the Early Bronze Age. Although Linear A, Linear B and the Cypriot syllabaries found from the 2nd millennium seem to share a common prototype, they also show great divergences which, by analogy with historically observed developments of scripts, would take many centuries to come about. Thus the evidence from the scripts' 'dialects' would seem to indicate that the original form existed in the 3rd millennium and would allow for its development in the 4th which, on the grounds given above, would have been a plausible period for this to have taken place. Finally, I have argued elsewhere that the latest the alphabet could have reached the Aegean is the middle of the 2nd millennium.9 If this is the case, it would seem plausible to suppose that the survival ofthe syllabaries shows that they were already well rooted in the region. Thus, in this way too, the evidence points to their existence in the 3rd millennium.
INTRODUCTION 17
Early Bronze Age civilization broke down in the 23rd century BC. In Egypt, it has been marked as the First Intermediate Period. In Mesopotamia there was the Gutian invasion from the north. The whole civilized world was racked by barbarian invasion and social revolt, both ofwhich may have been brought about by sudden climatic deterioration. It was in these years that Anatolia was invaded by groups that I believe should be identified with Phrygian and Proto-Armenian speakers. In Mainland Greece in this and the following centuries there were widespread destructions at the end ofceramic period Early Helladic II, which have been plausibly linked to an 'Aryan' or 'Hellenic' invasion of Greece but could also be the result of Egyptian raids and colonies at the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. Three centuries later there was another, though less devastating, destruction at the end of Early Helladic III,
c. 1900 BC, possibly associated with conquests of the Egyptian Pharaoh
Senwosret I, known to the Greeks as Sesostris. Postulating this degree of contact between the Aegean and the Near East in the 3rd millennium, it is likely that some of the words, place names and religious cults of Egyptian and Semitic origin discussed in this work were introduced into the Aegean at this time. On Mainland Greece these are less likely to have survived the turmoil of the northern invasions or infiltrations. However, in Crete and the Cyclades, which were not affected by such turmoils and may well have been largely Semitic-speaking, these cultural elements are much more
likely to have continued. I must repeat here that the scheme given above is not the topic of
these volumes, but my perception of its background. Thus, though I shall discuss many of the linguistic issues in Volume 2, and I have written elsewhere on some other aspects, I cannot provide full evi
dence here to back up all these contentions.10
PROPOSED HISTORICAL OUTLINE
BlackAthena is focused on Greek cultural borrowings from Egypt and the Levant in the 2nd millennium BC or, to be more precise, in the thousand years from 2100 to 1100 BC. Some of these may be earlier.



18 BLACK ATHENA
and a few later exchanges will also be considered. The reasons for choosing this particular time-span are first that this seems to have been the period in which Greek culture was formed, and secondly that I have found it impossible to discover indications of any earlier borrowings either from the Near East or from legendary, cultic or etymological Greek evidence. The scheme I propose is that while there seems to have been more or less continuous Near Eastern influence on the Aegean over this millennium, its intensity varied considerably at different periods. The first 'peak' ofwhich we have any trace was the 2I st century. It was then that Egypt recovered from the breakdown of the First Intermediate Period, and the so-called Middle Kingdom was established by the new I I th Dynasty. This not only reunited Egypt but attacked the Levant and is known from archaeological evidence to have had wide-ranging contacts further afield, certainly including Crete and possibly the Mainland. The succession of Upper Egyptian black pharaohs sharing the name Mentl}.otpe had as their divine patron the hawk and bull god Mn!W or Mont. It is during the same century that the Cretan palaces were established and one finds the beginnings there of the bull-cult which appears on the walls of the palaces and was central to Greek mythology about King Minos and Crete. It would therefore seem plausible to suppose that the Cretan developments directly or indirectly reflected the rise of the EgyptiaJ,1 Middle Kingdom. Just north of the Greek Thebes there is a large mound, traditionally called the tomb of Amphion and Zethos. One of its latest excavators, distinguished archaeologist T. Spyropoulos, describes this as an earthen stepped pyramid with a brick top in which there was a monumental - though robbed - tomb. He dates the pottery and few pieces of jewellery found near it to the ceramic period Early Helladic III - generally accepted to be around the 2I st century. On the basis ofthis, ofthe extraordinarily sophisticated draining ofthe nearby Lake Kopais - which seems to have taken place at about this time - and of the considerable Classical literature connecting the region to Egypt, Spyropoulos postulates an Egyptian colony in Boiotia in this period. 11 There is further evidence to support his hypothesis, which will be in the later volumes ofBlackA thena.
INTRODUCTION
Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that according to an ancient tradition referred to by Homer, Amphion and Zethos were the first founders of Thebes and that its other founder, Kadmos, arrived from the Near East long after their city had been destroyed. Like the Egyptian Pyramids, the tomb of Amphion and Zethos was associated with the sun and, like them, the Greek Thebes had close associations with a sphinx. Furthermore, it was in some way linked to the zodiacal sign Taurus, and many scholars have drawn parallels between the Theban and the Cretan bull-cults. Nothing is certain, but there is strong circumstantial evidence connecting the tomb and the first foundation of Thebes directly or indirectly to 11th-dynasty Egypt. While Crete kept the bull-cult as central for another 600 years, Egypt abandoned the royal cult ofMont with the rise ofthe 12th Dynasty soon after 2000 Be. The new dynasty had the Upper Egyptian ram god Amon as its patron. I believe that it is from influence ofthis period that most of the ram-cults found around the Aegean and generally associated with Zeus were derived, drawing both from Amon and from the Lower Egyptian cult of the ramigoat Mendes. Herodotos and later authors wrote at length about the widespread conquests of a pharaoh he called Sesostris, whose name has been identified with S-n-Wsrt or Senwosret, that of a number of 12thdynasty pharaohs. Herodotos' claims on this, however, have been treated with especial derision. The same treatment has been given to ancient legends concerning wide-ranging expeditions by the Ethiopian or Egyptian prince Memnon, whose name could well derive from >lmn-m-l,ut (written Ammenemes by later Greek writers), the name of other important 12th-dynasty pharaohs. Both legendary cycles now seem to have been vindicated by the recent reading of an inscription from Memphis which details the conquests, by land and sea, of two 12th-dynasty pharaohs, Senwosret I and Ammenemes II. There is also an intriguing resemblance between ijpr 10 R(, an alternative name for Senwosret, and Kekrops, the legendary founder ofAthens whom some ancient sources said was an Egyptian.12 The next wave of influence, about which tradition was much more clear-cut, took place during the Hyksos period. The Hyksos, whose name came from the 'Rulers ofForeign Lands', were



20 BLACK ATHENA
invaders from the north who conquered and ruled at least Lower Egypt from about 1720 to 1575 Be. Although other, possibly Hurrian, elements seem to have been involved, the Hyksos were predominandy Semitic-speaking.
The first revision I propose for the Ancient Model is to accept the idea that there were, during the 4th and 3rd millennia, invasions or infiltrations ofGreece by Indo-European speakers from the north. The second revision I want to make is to put Danaos' landing in Greece near the beginning ofthe Hyksos period, at around 1720 Be, not near its end - in or after 1575 - as set out in the ancient chronographies. Ever since late Antiquity, writers have seen links between the Egyptian records of the expulsion of the hated Hyksos by the Egyptian 18th Dynasty, the biblical tradition of the exodus from Egypt after the Israelite sojourn there, and the Greek legends of the arrival in Argos of Danaos. According to Greek tradition Danaos was either Egyptian or Syrian, but he definitely came from Egypt after or during his struggle with his twin, Aigyptos - whose origin is self-evident. This three-way association would seem plausible and has been reconciled, by some authorities, with the archaeological evidence. However, recent developments in radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology make it impossible to place the new settlements in Greece at the end ofthe Hyksos period. On the other hand, they and archaeological evidence from Crete would fit in very well with a landing in the late 18th century, at the period's beginning.
The ancient chronographers varied in their dating of the arrival of Kadmos and his 'second' foundation ofThebes. I would associate these legends too with the Hyksos, though they could refer to later periods. Greek tradition associated Danaos with the introduction of irrigation and Kadmos with the introduction of certain types of weapons, the alphabet, and a number of religious rituals. According to the Revised Ancient Model, it would seem that irrigation came with an earlier wave but other borrowings, including the chariot and the sword - both introduced to Egypt in Hyksos times - came soon after to the Aegean. In religion, the cults introduced at this stage seem to have centred on those around Poseidon and Athena. I maintain that the former should be identified with Seth, the Egyptian god ofthe wilderness or sea, to whom
INTRODUCTION 21
the Hyksos were devoted, and with the Semitic Yam (Sea) and Yahwe. Athena was the Egyptian Neit and probably the Semitic <Anat who also seems to have been worshipped by the Hyksos. This is not to deny that other cults ofsuch divinities as Aphrodite and Artemis were introduced
over this period. It is generally agreed that the Greek language was formed during the 17th and 16th centuries Be. Its Indo-European structure and basic lexicon are combined with anon-Indo-European vocabulary ofsophistication. I am convinced that much ofthe latter can be plausibly derived from Egyptian and West Semitic. This would fit very well with a long period of domination by Egypto-Semitic conquerors. In the mid- I 5th century the 18th Dynasty established a powerful empire in the Levant, and received tribute from the Aegean. Many 18th-dynasty objects have been found in that region. I believe that this was another high tide of Egyptian and that it was probably in this period that the cult of Dionysos - which was traditionally considered to be 'late' - was introduced to Greece. Specifically, I accept the ancient tradition that the Eleusinian mystery cult of Demeter was established in this period. 13 At the beginning of the 14th century Be I believe there was another invasion of Greece, that of the Pelopids or Achaians from Anatolia, which introduced new styles of fortification and possibly chariot-racing; but this is not of direct concern to my project. In the 12th century Be there was a more disruptive historical break. In Antiquity, what is now called the 'Dorian Invasion' was much more frequendy termed 'The Return of the Heraklids'. The incomers undoubtedly came from the north-western fringes of Greece, which had been less affected by the Middle Eastern culture ofthe Mycenaean palaces which they destroyed. Their calling themselves 'Heraklids' is fascinating, as it was a claim not only to divine descent from Herakles but also to Egyptian and Phoenician ancestors of the royal families which had been replaced by the Pelopids. There is no doubt that the descendants of these conquerors, the Dorian kings of Classical and Hellenistic times, believed themselves to be descended from Egyptians and Phoenicians. 14 In Volume 2, I shall consider what I see to be the 'Egyptianizing' of



22 BLACK ATHENA
Spartan society between 800 and 500 BC, and in Volume 3 I shall also discuss the introduction in the 6th century BC ofEgyptian Orphic cults. I have written elsewhere about the Phoenician origin of the polis or city-state and of Marxist 'Slave Society' as a whole, in the 9th and 8th centuries. I also hope, at some time, to work on the transmission of Egyptian and Phoenician science, philosophy and theoretical politics by the Greek 'founders' of these subjects, most ofwhom studied in Egypt or Phoenicia. However, Black Athena is essentially concerned with the Egyptian and Semitic roles in the formation of Greece in the Middle and Late Bronze Age.
BLACKATHENA, VOLUME I:
A SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT
The first volume ofBlackAthena is concerned with the development of the Ancient and Aryan Models, and the first chapter, 'The Ancient Model in Antiquity', treats the attitudes of Greeks in the Classical and Hellenistic periods to their distant past. It considers the writings of authors who affirmed the Ancient Model, referred to Egyptian colonies in Thebes and Athens, and gave details ofthe Egyptian conquest ofthe Argolid and the Phoenician foundation ofThebes. I discuss the claims made by various 19th- and 20th-century 'source critics' that the Ancient Model was concocted only in the 5th century BC, and I cite iconographic evidence and a number of earlier references to demonstrate that the scheme existed several centuries earlier. Chapter I pays special attention to Aischylos' The Suppliants, which describes the arrival in Argos of Danaos and his daughters. The argument here, on the basis ofa number of etymologies, is that there is considerable evidence of Egyptian influence in the play's peculiar vocabulary, indicating that Aischylos was in touch with extremely ancient traditions. In particular, I claim that the theme itselfis based on a pun between hikes(ios) (suppliant) and Hyksos; while at another level, the idea that the settlers from Egypt had come as suppliants can be seen as a sop to Greek national pride. A similar attempt to soften the blow can be seen in the Timaios, in which Plato admitted an ancient 'genetic' relationship between Egypt and Greece, in general; and Athens and
INTRODUCTION 23
Sais, the major city at the north-western edge ofthe Delta, in particular. But, rather implausibly, he claimed priority for Athens. Like some other Greeks, Aischylos and Plato appear to have been offended by the legends of colonization because they put Hellenic culture in an inferior position to that of the Egyptians and Phoenicians, towards whom most Greeks of this time appear to have felt an acute ambivalence. The Egyptians and Phoenicians were despised and feared, but at the same time deeply respected for their antiquity and well-preserved ancient religion and philosophy. The fact that so many Greeks overcame their antipathies and transmitted these 'traditions [of colonization] so little accommodating to national prejudice' greatly impressed the 18th-century historian William Mitford, who used it to maintain that 'for their essential circumstances they seem unquestionable.' Before Mitford no one questioned the Ancient Model, so there was no need to articulate a defence of it. Such motives of 'national prejudice' would help explain Thucydides' failure to mention these legends, ofwhich he was certainly aware. Chapter I goes on to discuss some of the equations made between specific Greek and Egyptian divinities and rituals, and the general belief that the Egyptian were the earlier forms and that Egyptian religion was the original one. Only in this way - the desire to return to the ancient and proper forms - can one explain why, starting in the 5th century at the latest, Egyptian deities began to be worshipped under Egyptian names - and following Egyptian ritual - throughout Greece, the East Mediterranean and later the whole Roman world. It was only after the collapse of Egyptian religion in the 2nd century AD that other Oriental cults, notably Christianity, began to replace it.
Chapter II, 'Egyptian wisdom and Greek transmission from the Dark Ages to the Renaissance', considers the attitude ofthe Church Fathers towards Egypt. After the crushing of Neo-Platonism, the Hellenic, pagan descendant of Egyptian religion, and Gnosticism, its JudaeoChristian counterpart, Christian thinkers tamed Egyptian religion by turning it into a philosophy. The process was identified with the figure of Hermes Trismegistos, a euhemerized or rationalized version of



BLACK ATHENA
Thoth, the Egyptian god ofwisdom; and a number of texts associated with Thoth, written in the last centuries of the Egyptian religion, were attributed to him. The Church Fathers were divided on whether or not Trismegistos antedated Moses and biblical moral philosophy. Saint Augustine's weighty opinion came down firmly in favour ofthe priority, and hence the superiority, of Moses and the Bible. Following the Classical tradition, however, the Fathers were united in the belief that the Greeks had learnt most of their philosophy from the Egyptians though the Egyptians might have learnt some of theirs in tum from Mesopotamia and Persia. Thus, throughout the Middle Ages, Hermes Trismegistos was seen as the founder of non-biblical or 'Gentile' philosophy and culture. This beliefcontinued through the Renaissance. The revival ofGreek studies in the 15th century created a love of Greek literature and language and an identification with the Greeks, but no one questioned the fact that the Greeks had been the pupils of the Egyptians, in whom there was an equal, if not more passionate, interest. The Greeks were admired for having preserved and transmitted a small part of this ancient wisdom: to some extent the experimental techniques of men like Paracelsus and Newton were developed to retrieve this lost Egyptian or Hermetic knowledge. A few Hermetic texts had been available in Latin translation throughout the Dark and Middle Ages; many more were found in 1460 and were brought to the court of Cosimo di Medici in Florence, where they were translated by his leading scholar, Marsilio Ficino. These and the ideas contained in them became central to the Neo-Platonist movement started by Ficino, which was itself at the heart of Renaissance Humanism. Although Copernicus' mathematics was derived from Islamic science, his heliocentricity seems to have come with the revival of the Egyptian notion of a divine sun in the new intellectual environment of Hermeticism in which he was formed. His champion Giordano Bruno, at the end of the 16th century, was more explicit on this and went beyond the respectable Christian Neo-Platonic Hermeticism ofFicino. Appalled by the Wars of Religion and Christian intolerance, he advocated a return to the original or natural religion, that ofEgypt, for which he was burnt at the stake by the Inquisition in 1600.
INTRODUCTION 25
This brings us to Chapter III, 'The triumph ofEgypt in the 17th and 18th centuries'. Bruno's influence continued after his death. He seems to have had some contact with the founders of the mysterious and elusive Rosicrucians, whose anonymous manifestos fascinated people in the early 17th century: the Rosicrucians, too, saw Egypt as the fount of religion and philosophy. It is commonly supposed that the Hermetic Texts were discredited in 1614 by the great scholar Isaac Casaubon, who showed to his satisfaction that the Texts did not come from deepest Antiquity but were post-Christian. This view has been accepted as axiomatic since the 19th century, even by 'rebel' scholars such as Frances Yates. However, in this chapter I try to show why I am inclined to the view put forward by the Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie that the earliest Texts date back to the 5th century Be. Whatever their actual date, the belief that Casaubon destroyed the credibility of the Texts is wrong. Hermeticism continued to be a major force well into the second half of the 17th century and retained considerable influence even after that. The Texts did, however, lose their appeal with the decline in the beliefin magic among the upper classes at the end ofthe 17th century. Though the Hermetic Texts became less attractive to the thinkers of the Enlightenment, interest in and admiration for Egypt did not diminish. In general the 18th century was a period of Classicism and one with a desire for order and stability, and so Rome was usually preferred to Greece; at the same time - in order to break away from the feudalism and superstitious Christianity of the European past - there was great interest in other non-European civilizations. By far the most influential of these, for this century, were those of Egypt and China. Both were seen as having superior writing systems representing ideas, not sounds; and both had profound and ancient philosophies. Their most attractive feature, however, seems to have been that they were ruled rationally, without superstition, by a corps of men recruited for their morality and required to undergo rigorous initiation and training.
Egyptian priesthoods had in fact appealed to conservative thinkers at least since the time when Plato had modelled his Guardians on them. In the 18th century this line of thought was taken up by the Freemasons; but even in the Middle Ages, Freemasons appear to have



BLACK ATHENA
been especially interested in Egypt because, following ancient tradition, they believed it to be the home of geometry or Masonry. With the formation of Speculative Masonry at the turn of the 18th century they drew on Rosicrucianism and Bruno to establish a 'twofold philosophy'. This entailed superstitious and limited religions for the masses but, for the illuminati, a return to the natural and pure original religion ofEgypt, from the debris of which all the others had been created. Thus the Masons, who included almost every significant figure in the Enlightenment, saw their religion as Egyptian; their signs as hieroglyphs; their lodges as Egyptian temples; and themselves as an Egyptian priesthood. Indeed, the Masonic admiration for Egypt has survived the country's fall from grace among academics. With some degree of selfdeprecation, Masons have maintained the cult until today, as an anomaly in a world where 'true' history is seen to have begun with the Greeks. The culmination of radical Masonry - and its most acute threat to Christian order - came during the period of the French Revolution. Here the political and military menace was accompanied by an intellectual challenge in the work of the great French scholar, anticlerical and revolutionary Charles Dupuis. Dupuis's case was that Egyptian mythology - which, following Herodotos, he saw as the same as that of Greece - was essentially made up of allegories for the movements of the constellations, and that Christianity was merely a collection of misunderstood fragments of this grand tradition.
'Hostilities to Egypt in the 18th century' is the topic of Chapter IV. The Egyptian menace to Christianity naturally provoked response and Bruno's immolation, and Casaubon's attack on the antiquity of the Hermetic Texts, can both be seen as early instances of this reaction. However, the situation became acute once more at the end of the 17th century with the reorganization and attempted radicalization of Masonry. The threat posed by this 'Radical Enlightenment' can explain the sharp change in Newton's attitudes towards Egypt. In his early work he followed his Cambridge Neo-Platonist teachers in their respect for the country, but the last decades ofhis life were spent trying to diminish Egypt's importance by bringing down the date of its foundation to
}
INTRODUCTION
just before the Trojan War. Newton was concerned with a threat to his conception of physical order and its theological and political counterparts - a divinity with regular habits and the Whig constitutional monarchy. The threat was of pantheism, implying an animate universe without need for a regulator or even a creator. This pantheism could be traced back past Spinoza to Bruno and beyond, to the Neo-Platonists and Egypt itself. The first articulate rejection of the challenge of the Radical Enlightenment - and the earliest popularization of the Newtonian 'Whig' scheme in science, politics and religion - was made in 1693 by Richard Bentley, Newton's friend and a great sceptical Classicist. One way in which Bentley attacked his and Newton's enemies was to use Casaubon's tactics. He employed his critical scholarship to undermine Greek sources on the antiquity and wisdom of the Egyptians. Thus throughout the 18th and 19th centuries we find a de facto alliance of Hellenism and textual criticism with the defence of Christianity. The ructions caused by occasional Hellenist atheists like Shelley and Swinburne were trivial compared to the threat ofAegypto-Masonry. Newton had merely tried to demote Egypt in relation to Christianity; he did not try to raise Greece. By the middle of the 18th century, however, a number of Christian apologists were using the emerging paradigm of 'progress', with its presupposition that 'later is better', to promote the Greeks at the expense of the Egyptians. These strands of thought soon merged with two others that were becoming dominant at the same time: racism and Romanticism. Thus Chapter IV also outlines the development of racism based on skin colour in late- I 7th-century England, alongside the increasing importance of the American colonies, with their twin policies ofextermination ofthe Native Americans and enslavement of African Blacks. This racism pervaded the thought ofLocke, Hume and other English thinkers. Their influence - and that of the new European explorers of other continents - was important at the university of Gottingen, founded in 1734 by George II, Elector of Hanover and King of England, and forming a cultural bridge between Britain and Germany. It is not surprising, therefore, that the first 'academic' work on human racial classification - which naturally put Whites, or to use his new term, 'Caucasians', at the head of the



BLACK ATHENA
hierarchy - was written in the 1770S by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, a professor at Gottingen. The university pioneered the establishment of modem disciplinary scholarship. In the same decade, other professors at Gottingen began to publish histories not of individuals, but of peoples and races and their institutions. These 'modem' projects, combined with exhaustiveness and a critical approach to sources, can usefully be seen as an academic aspect of the new Romantic concern with ethnicity, current in German and British society at the time. 18th-century Romanticism was not merely a faith in the primacy of emotion and a belief in the inadequacy of reason. Clustered around these were feelings for landscapes especially wild, remote and cold ones - and admiration for the vigorous, virtuous and primitive folk who were somehow moulded by them. These sentiments were combined with the belief that as the landscape and climate of Europe were better than those of other continents, Europeans must be superior. They were championed by Montesquieu and Rousseau, but took firmest root in Britain and Germany. By the end of the 18th century, 'progress' had become a dominant paradigm, dynamism and change were valued more than stability, and the world began to be viewed through time rather than across space. Nevertheless, space remained important for the Romantics, because of their concern for the local formation of peoples or 'races'. Thus a race was believed to change its form as it passed through different ages, but always to retain an immutable individual essence. Real communication was no longer perceived as taking place through reason, which could reach any rational man. It was now seen as flowing through feeling, which could touch only those tied to each other by kinship or 'blood' and sharing a common 'heritage'.
To return to the theme of racism. Many Ancient Greeks shared a feeling very like what would now be called nationalism: they despised other peoples and some, like Aristotle, even put this on a theoretical plane by claiming a Hellenic superiority based on the geographical situation of Greece. It was a feeling qualified by the very real respect many Greek writers had for foreign cultures, particularly those of Egypt, Phoenicia and Mesopotamia. But in any event, the strength of
INTRODUCTION 29
this Ancient Greek 'nationalism' was negligible compared to the tidal ethnicity and racialism, linked to cults of Christian Europe and thtNorth, that engulfed Northern Europe with the Romantic movement at the end of the 18th century. The paradigm of ,races' that were intrinsically unequal in physical and mental endowment was applied to all human studies, but especially to history. It was now considered if not disastrous, for races to mix. To be creative, a civihzation needed to be 'racially pure'. Thus it became increasingly intolerable that Greece - which was seen by the Romantics not merely as the epitome of Europe but also as its pure childhood - could be the result of the mixture of native Europeans and colonizing Africans and Semites.
Chapter V, 'Romantic linguistics: the rise ofIndia and the fall ofEgypt, 1740-1880', begins with a sketch of the Romantic origins of historical linguistics and the passion at the turn of the 18th century for ancient India largely caused by the perception of a fundamental relationship between Sanskrit and the European languages. It also surveys the decline in the European estimation of China, as the balance of trade between the two turned in Europe's favour and the British and French carried out increasingly large-scale attacks on China. I argue that these factors necessitated changing the image of China from one of a refined and enlightened civilization to one of a society filled with drugs, dirt, corruption and torture. Ancient Egypt, which in the 18th century had been seen as a very close parallel to China, suffered from the same effects of the need to justify the increasing European expansion into other continents and maltreatment of their indigenous peoples. Both were flung into prehistory to serve as a solid and inert basis for the dynamic development of the superior races, the Aryans and the Semites. Despite the fall in Egypt's reputation, interest in the country continued during the 19th century. Indeed, in some ways this interest even increased with the explosion of knowledge about it that followed Napoleon's Expedition there in 1798; its most important consequence being Jean Champollion's decipherment of hieroglyphics. In the chapter I look at some ofthe intricacies ofChampollion's motivation



30 BLACK ATHENA
and academic career in relation to the Masonic tradition and the triangular relationship between Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and Christianity. Here we need simply note that by the time of his death in 183 I his championship of Egypt had antagonized both the Christian political establishment and the newly and passionately Hellenist academic one. Thus, after an initial enthusiasm for it, Champollion's decipherment was neglected for a quarter ofa century. On its revival in the late 1850s, scholars were torn between the appeal of Egypt and the brilliance of Champollion's work on the one hand and the intense racism of the age on the other. By the I 880s academics saw Egyptian culture as a static and sterile cultural cuI de sac. During the 19th century a number of mathematicians and astronomers were 'seduced' by what they saw as the mathematical elegance of the Pyramids into believing that they the repositories of a higher ancient wisdom. They were classified as cranks for this triple offence against professionalism, racism and the concept of 'progress' - the three cardinal beliefs of the 19th century. Among 'sound' scholars the reputation ofthe Egyptians has remained low. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Romantic scholars saw the Egyptians as essentially morbid and lifeless. At the end of the 19th century a new contrary but equally disparaging image began to emerge. The Egyptians were now seen to conform to the contemporary European vision ofMricans: gay, pleasure-loving, childishly boastful and essentially materialistic. Another way oflooking at these changes is to assume that after the rise ofblack slavery and racism, European thinkers were concerned to keep black Africans as for as possible from European civilization. Where men and women in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance were uncertain about the colour ofthe Egyptians, the Egyptophil Masons tended to see them as white. Next, the Hellenomaniacs of the early 19th century began to doubt their whiteness and to deny that the Egyptians had been civilized. It was only at the end ofthe 19th century, when Egypt had been entirely stripped ofits philosophic reputation, that its African affinities could be re-established. Notice that in each case the necessary divide between B!lJcks and civilization was clearly demarcated. Yet despite the triumph of Hellenism and dismissal of Egypt in academic circles, the concept of Egypt as 'the cradle of civilization' never completely died. Moreover,

Chapter VI is entitled 'Hellenomania, 1: The fall ofthe Ancient Model, 1790-1830'. Although racism was always a major source ofhostility to the Ancient Model and became a mainstay of the Aryan one, it was matched in the 18th and early 19th centuries by an attack on the significance of Egypt from Christians alarmed at the threat of the religion or 'wisdom' of Egypt. These Christian attacks challenged Greek statements about the importance of Egypt, and boosted the independent creativity of Greece in order to diminish that of Egypt. Indeed, it is deeply significant that the Ancient Model was first challenged between 1815 and 1830, for these were years of intense reaction against the Masonic rationalism seen to be behind the French Revolution; and years of Romanticism and Christian revival. Further, as Christianity was identified with Europe, the two could come together with the notion of progress in a philhellenic movement which backed the struggle ofthe Christian, European and 'young' Greeks against the 'old' Asian, infidel Turks. In the 1820S, the Gottingen professor Karl Otfried Muller used the new techniques of source criticism to discredit all the ancient references to the Egyptian colonizations, and weaken those concerning the Phoenicians. These techniques had also begun to be used to attack the reports of Greeks having studied in Egypt. The Ancient Model had placed a barrier in the way of the new faiths that Greek culture was essentially European and that philosophy and civilization had originated in Greece; this barrier was 'scientifically' removed even before the general acceptance of the notion of an Indo-European language family. The title of Chapter VII is 'Hellenomania, 2: Transmission of the new scholarship to England and the rise ofthe Aryan Model, 183°-6o'. Unlike the Ancients, the proponents of the Aryan Model were firm believers in 'progress'. Victors were seen as more advanced, and hence



32 BLACK ATHENA
'better', than the vanquished. Thus, despite apparent and short-term anomalies, history - now seen as the biographies ofraces - consisted of the triumphs of strong and vital peoples over weak and feeble ones. 'Races', formed by the landscape and climates of their homelands, retained permanent essences, even though they took on new forms in every new age. For these scholars, in addition, it was self-evident that the greatest 'race' in world history was the European or Aryan one. It alone had, and always would have, the capacity to conquer all other peoples and to create advanced, dynamic civilizations - as opposed to the static societies ruled by Asians or Africans. Some fringe Europeans, like the Slavs and the Spaniards, might be conquered by other 'races', but such a rule - unlike the conquest of 'inferior races' by Europeanscould never be permanent or beneficial. These paradigms of 'race' and 'progress' and their corollaries of 'racial purity', and the notion that the only beneficial conquests were those of 'master races' over subject ones, could not tolerate the Ancient Model. Thus Miiller's refutations of the legends of Egyptian colonization in Greece were quickly accepted. The Aryan Model - which followed his success - was constructed within the new paradigms. Itwas encouraged by a number offactors: the discovery ofthe Indo-European language family with the Indo-Europeans or Aryans soon seen as a 'race'; the plausible postulation of an original Indo-European homeland in central Asia; and the need to explain that Greek was fundamentally an Indo-European language. Moreover at precisely the same period, the early 19th century, there was intense historical concern with the Germanic overwhelming of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, and the Aryan conquests in India in the 2nd millennium Be. The application ofthe model ofnorthern conquest to Greece was thus obvious and very attractive: vigorous conquerors were supposed to have come from a suitably stimulating homeland to the north of Greece, while the 'Pre-Hellenic' aborigines had been softened by the undemanding nature oftheir homeland. And although the large number of non-Indo-European elements in Greek culture could not be reconciled with the ideal of complete Aryan' Hellenic purity, the notion ofa northern conquest did make the inevitable 'racial' mixing as painless as possible. Naturally the purer and more northern

INTRODUCTION 33
Hellenes were the conquerors, as befitted a master race. The PreHellenic Aegean populations, for their part, were sometimes seen as
'rginally Europ.ean, and as in way, even the natives were untamted by Afncan and SemItIc blood . The question of 'Semitic blood' leads us to Chapter VIII, 'The rise and fall of the Phoenicians, 1830-85'. K. O. Miiller, writing in the 1820S, had denied that the Phoenicians had had any influence on Greece, but he was extreme in his Romanticism and ahead ofhis time in the intensity of his racialism and anti-Semitism. In some ways, therefore, the Phoenicians even profited from the fall ofthe Egyptians, since legends of Egyptian colonization could now be explained as having referred to them. Consciously or unconsciously, all European thinkers saw the Phoenicians as the Jews of Antiquity - as clever 'Semitic' traders. The predominant mid- 19th-century view ofworld history was one of a dialogue between Aryan and Semite. The Semite had created religion and poetry; the Aryan conquest, science, philosophy, freedom and everything else worth having. This limited recognition of the 'Semites' corresponded with what one might call a limited 'window of opportunity' in Western Europe, between the disappearance of religious hatred of the Jews and the rise of 'racial' anti-Semitism. In England, which had mixed traditions ofanti- and philo-Semitism, there was considerable admiration of the Phoenicians because their cloth trading, exploration and apparent moral rectitude seemed, to both foreigners and English, to be almost Victorian. The opposing view of the Phoenicians - and other Semites - as luxurious, cruel and treacherous always persisted, and was generally predominant on the continent. This hatred of the Phoenicians as both 'English' and Oriental was particularly striking in the works ofthe great French Romantic historian Jules Michelet. Michelet's views on the Phoenicians were spread even more widely in Flaubert's immensely popular historical novel Salammbo, published in 186 I. SalammbO contained vivid descriptions of Carthage at its most decadent which powerfully reinforced the already widespread anti-Semitic and anti-Oriental prejudices. Still more damning his brilliant and gruesome description of the sacrifice of children to Moloch. The firm and public attachment of this ultimate biblical abomination to the Carthaginians and Phoenicians made it very



34 BLACK ATHENA
difficult to champion them, and during the 1870S and 80S their reputation plummeted even faster than that ofthe Jews. This leads us to Chapter IX, 'The final solution of the Phoenician problem, 1880-1945'. With this reputation and the rise of antiSemitism in the 1880s, there was a sustained attack on the Phoenicians which was particularly fierce where it came to their legendary contacts with, and influence on, the Greeks - who had by now been given semi-divine status. A decade later, in the 1890s, two short but extraordinarily influential articles were published byJulius Beloch, a German who taught in Italy, and Salomon Reinach, an assimilated Alsatian Jew at the centre of Parisian cultivated society and scholarship. Both recognized Muller as a forerunner and claimed that Greek civilization was purely European, while the Phoenicians, apart from their transmission ofthe consonantal alphabet, had contributed nothing to Hellenic culture. Although many scholars were reluctant to accept this position over the next twenty years, the basis of what I call the Extreme Aryan Model was firmly established by the turn of the 20th century. There was a marked difference, for instance, between reactions to Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Mycenaean civilization in the 1870S and Arthur Evans' reports ofthe Cretan one at Knossos in 1900. In the earlier case, several scholars initially suggested that the finds, which were completely unlike those from Classical Greece, could be Phoenician. This was then energetically denied in the following decades. In 1900, by contrast, the culture at Knossos was immediately tagged with the new name 'Minoan' and considered to be 'Pre-Hellenic'; certainly not Semitic, despite the ancient traditions that Crete had been so. The final elimination ofthe Piloenician influence on Greece - and its complete dismissal as a 'mirage' - came only in the 1920S with the crescendo ofanti-Semitism resulting from the imagined and real role of Jews in the Russian Revolution and the Communist 3rd International. In the 1920S and 30S all the legends of Phoenician colonization of Greece were discredited, as were reports ofPhoenician presence in the Aegean and Italy in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. The many previously proposed Semitic origins of Greek names and words were all denied. Every effort was now made to limit the significance of the only
INTRODUCTION 35
irreducible borrowing from Semitic culture - the alphabet. First, great emphasis was laid on the supposed Greek invention ofvowels which, it
' "argued, were essential to a 'true' alphabet and without which, it was implied, man was unable to think logically. Secondly, the site of the borrowing was shifted to Rhodes, Cyprus and finally to an alleged Greek colony on the Syrian coast. This was partly because it was now seen as more in character for the 'dynamic' Greeks to have brought it from the Middle East than to have received it passively from 'Semites' as the legends had stated, but it was also because borrowing was perceived to involve social mixing, and the racial contamination that this would have entailed in Greece was unacceptable. Thirdly, the date of
transmission was now lowered to C.720 BC, safely after the creation ofthe polis and the formative period of Archaic Greek culture. This opened up a long period of illiteracy between the disappearance of the Linear scripts discovered by Evans and the introduction ofthe alphabet, which in turn provided a double advantage: it allowed Homer to be the blindalmost northern - bard of an illiterate society, and it established an impermeable seal or complete Dark Age between the Mycenaean and Archaic ages. In this way, later Greek reports of their early history and the Ancient Model were discredited still further. The 193os were years in which positivism weakened in 'hard' science but gained strength beyond its borders in such fringe subjects as logic and ancient history. Thus in Classics the solution of the Phoenician problem seemed 'scientific' and final: from now on the discipline could proceed scientifically or, as one would now put it, a paradigm had been established. Any scholar who denied it was outlawed as incompetent, unsound or a crank. The strength ofthis position is demonstrated by its survival for more than thirty years after the consequences of antiSemitism were revealed in 1945, profoundly shaking the ideological basis of anti-Phoenicianism. In the long term, however, there has been a retreat from the Extreme Aryan Model, and this process is described in Chapter X, 'The post-war situation: the return to the Broad Aryan Model, 1945-85'. It is probable that the foundation of Israel has been more influential than the Holocaust in the restoration of the Phoenicians. Since 1949, Jews - or at least Israelis - have been increasingly accepted as full



BLACK ATHENA
Europeans, and it has become quite clear that speaking a Semitic language does not disqualify people from military achievement. Moreover, the 1950S also saw a sharp increase ofJewish confidence in their Semitic roots. In the context ofthis process - and possibly because they were unable to accept the exclusiveness of either orthodox Judaism or Zionism Cyrus Gordon and Michael Astour, two great Semitists, began to champion West Semitic Civilization as a whole and to attack the Extreme Aryan Model. Gordon, who knows the languages of the Ancient East Mediterranean better than any other living person, has always seen it as his mission to prove interconnections between Hebraic and Hellenic culture. In this process his bridges have been Ugarit, an ancient port on the Syrian coast, and Crete. He saw connections to both the Bible and Homer in the Canaanite myths recorded in Ugarit in the 14th and 13th centuries and translated in the 1940S and 50S; the monograph he published on the subject in 1955 destroyed his reputation as a 'sound' scholar, but fascinated some general historians and members of the lay public. Soon after this, he offended the orthodox still further by reading the Cretan Linear A inscriptions as Semitic, immediately facing a barrage of objections, nearly all of which have been removed by later research. Most scholars, however, have still not accepted his interpretation. While Ventris' decipherment - a few years earlier - of Linear B as Greek was novel, it was welcome in that it confirmed the geographical breadth and historical depth of Greek culture; but to accept Linear A, and hence Minoan civilization, as Semitic-speaking was to upset all notions of Hellenic, and therefore of European, uniqueness. The upholders of conventional wisdom have been equally, if not more, disconcerted by Hellenosemitica, a major work by Gordon's colleague Michael Astour, which first appeared in 1967. Hellenosemitica, a series of studies of striking parallels between West Semitic and Greek mythology, showed connections of structure and nomenclature that were far too close to be explained away as similar manifestations ofthe human psyche. Apart from the challenge posed by this basic theme, Astour made three other fundamental attacks. First, the fact ofhis writing the book at all upset the academic status quo. While
INTRODUCTION 37
it was permissible for a Classicist, coming from the dominant discipline, the Middle East in its relation to Greece and Rome, the converse did not hold true. A Semitist was felt to have no right to write about Greece. Secondly, Astour questioned the absolute primacy of archaeology over all other sources of evidence about prehistory - myth, legend, language and names - thus threatening the 'scientific' status of ancient history. Thirdly, he sketched out a sociology of knowledge for Classics, indicating links between developments in scholarship and those in society. He even implied a connection between anti-Semitism and hostility to the Phoenicians and cast doubt on the notion of steady accumulative progress of learning. But the worst threat came from his basic message that the legends of Danaos and Kadmos contained a factual kernel. So many heresies could not go unpunished. Astour was so battered by his critics that he has stopped work on the field he had so brilliandy opened up. Nevertheless his work, like that of Gordon, has had profound effects: together with the increasing number of finds of Levantine objects in Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age sites in the Aegean, it has subverted the Extreme Aryan Model. It would seem fair to say that by 1985 the majority of researchers working in the area have retreated to the Broad Aryan Model. That is to say, they accept the possibility of Bronze Age West Semitic setdements not merely on the islands but on the mainland, at least at Thebes. They also believe that Phoenician influence on Iron Age Greece began well before the 8th century BC, and possibly as early as the lOth. On the other hand, Gordon and Astour, for all their intellectual daring, have not challenged the Aryan Model itself. Neither ofthem has considered the possibility ofa massive Semitic component in the Greek vocabulary; nor, given their Semitic preoccupations, have they investigated the possible Egyptian colonizations of Greece and the hypothesis that Egyptian language and culture played an equal or even more central role in the formation of Greek civilization. There have been a few attempts to revive the traditions of Egyptian influence on Greece. In 1968, the East German Egyptologist Siegfried Morenz published a major work on the subject and its wider ramifications for Europe as a whole, but this has received very litde attention



BLACK ATHENA
outside Germany. Dr Spyropoulos' postulation ofan Egyptian colony in 21st-century Thebes has been buried in decent obscurity. Scholars have sniped at his dating, while avoiding as far as possible any mention of his 'cranky' conclusion. IS For the most part, the only people to consider major Egyptian influences on Greece have been on or beyond the fringes ofacademia; men such as Peter Tompkins - who has written on a wide range ofjournalistic topics as well as his cautiously written but boldly titled Secrets ofthe Great Pyramid- and the Afroamerican scholar G. G. M.James, whose fascinating little book Stolen Legacy also makes a plausible case for Greek science and philosophy having borrowed massively from Egypt. The Fabrication ends with the prediction that although the Broad Aryan Model will take somewhat longer to overthrow than the Extreme one, a revised form of the Ancient Model will be generally accepted early in the next century.
The following sections of the Introduction contain a considerable amount of technical discussion and are not necessary to an understanding of this volume. I therefore recommend readers whose chief interests are in historiography to go directly to the beginning of Chapter I.

Volume 2 of Black Athena is concerned with comparing the relative fruitfulness of the two models to a number of different disciplines or approaches to historical reconstruction; contemporary documentary sources, archaeology, place names, language and religious cults. The Introduction to this volume is a comparison ofthe inherent plausibility of the two models. With the possible exception ofknowledge ofAncient Egypt, it is clear that proponents of the Ancient Model had more information about the 2nd millennium BC than do those ofthe Aryan one. The latter, however, have not based their claims to superiority on quantity ofinformation but
INTRODUCTION 39
'scientific method' and objectivity, both of which are fundamentally questioned in The Fabrication ofAncient Greece. On the issue of objectivity it is pointed out that while the Greek writers were tom between their wish to gain additional historical depth for their culture and their desire to be superior in every way to their neighbours, the 19th-century scholars had no such ambivalence. They had every interest in elevating European Greece and in downgrading the African Egyptians and the Semitic Phoenicians. This in itself would make an outsider incline to the belief that the Ancients were more 'objective' than 19th- and earlY-2oth-century historians. However, better possibilities of access to information and greater objectivity do not in themselves mean that the Ancient Model has a superior explanatory value to that of the Aryan one. As I have argued, and reiterate in the conclusion of this volume, the latter should not be dismissed simply because the motives that inspired its construction are now considered suspect. For example, the fact that the i9th-century scholars revelled in the historical pichIres ofthe Aryan invasion ofIndia and the formation of the system on the basis of colour does not remove the scheme's utility as a historical explanation. We should remember, however, that in India, unlike Greece, there were ancient traditions of invasion. Chapter I of Greece European or Levantine.' outlines the documentary evidence for the period and area with which we are concerned. The East Mediterranean in the 2nd millennium BC was not illiterate: Egyptians and Levantines had been writing for centuries; Crete was using its own hieroglyphs and Linear A, which was also employed on the Cyclades. Further, it is overwhelmingly likely that Linear B developed on Mainland Greece during the first half of the millennium, and I also maintain that most of the East Mediterranean was using alphabets by the 15th century BC. I6 Thus not only was writing widespread but, unlike the formulators of the Aryan Model, we are able to
read most ofits various forms. Having said this, the documentary evidence for relations between the different cultural regions of the East Mediterranean in this period remains scanty. The Mit Rahineh inscription discovered recently on a block under a colossal statue gives details of wide-ranging Egyptian



BLACK ATHENA
land expeditions and marine voyages in the 20th century BC. 17 It has been known for some time that early in the 16th century BC Queen Al:tl:totpe, the mother of the first pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, was supposed to have come from J:bw Nbw, a foreign region that has been plausibly identified with the Aegean. The report seems to be confirmed by the Aegean designs of some of her jewellery. Although her son Amosis also seems to have claimed some kind of suzerainty over I:IJW Nbw, nothing further is heard of this for over a century. Whatever the nature ofthe relationship between Amosis and I:I3W Nbw, it is clear that at the end of the Hyksos period and the beginning of the 18th Dynasty there was some interchanging ofpopulation. The name P3 Kfclwy, 'The Cretan', occurs in Egypt at this time, and Egyptians and Levantines appear on a list of Cretan names found in a contemporary Egyptian papyrus. This picture ofa thoroughly mixed population in the Southern Aegean in the 17th century BC is confirmed by frescoes from Thera and by later personal names found in.Linears A and B. Egyptian documentary evidence of contact with the Aegean is much more abundant for the 15th and 14th centuries BC. Inscriptions and tomb-paintings make it clear that after Tuthmosis Ill's conquests in Syria in the middle of the 15th century, the Egyptians felt able to exercise some form of suzerainty over Crete and beyond, which was renewed many times over the next hundred years. Soon after the relationship was established, Egyptian documents and paintings indicate a change of power in Crete, which tallies with archaeological evidence from Knossos to suggest that there was a Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans at this point. Egyptian texts stopped referring to Kfclw in the Aegean, replacing it with TIru or Ta-na-yu. The identification ofthis with the Danaans and Greece is made almost certain by a 14th-century inscription giving the names of places in Ta-na-yu, several ofwhich have been plausibly identified with toponyms in Crete and Greece. Moreover, from the same period there is a letter from the king ofthe Phoenician city ofTyre to the Egyptian pharaoh referring to a king ofDa-nu-na, which could well be in Greece. There are references to contacts between the Levant and the Aegean in the 14th century in both Ugaritic and Linear B. Ugaritic merchants were trading with Crete, and I believe that the personal name Dnn

that port. The tablets in Linear B show that there was a Greek-speaking palatial society and economy in Crete and the Peloponnese, very much like those in the contemporary Near East. Linguistically, the Linear B inscriptions show that many of the admitted Semitic loan words in Greek were already present in the 14th century. Admittedly, these are generally the 'ideologically sound' semantic areas of luxury goods that could have been brought by Semitic traders. However, they include chiton, the standard word for 'dress', and chrysos (gold), a metal that had been of central cultic importance in Greece since the Neolithic, which indicate a great depth ofcontact by the Late Bronze Age. Furthermore, there are many personal names of the type 'Egyptian', 'Tyrian', and so on. All in all, the documents indicate close contacts and population mixture of a type that would be quite consistent with the Ancient Model. On the other hand they could be accommodated by the Aryan Model, and there is no documentary proof of the legendary colonizations.
Chapter II is on Archaeology. It begins with the possible traces of Middle Kingdom influences in Boiotia at the tum of the 2nd millennium. Much of the chapter, however, is concerned with the dating of the great explosion at Thera, an island seventy miles north ofCrete. We know that this eruption of the whole centre of the island was several times the size of the gigantic one at Krakatoa in 1883. Since the Krakatoa eruption broke windows hundreds of miles away, and sent tidal waves across the Indian Ocean - and since the dust it sent around the world helped the development of Impressionism and affected the climate of the whole Northern Hemisphere - the impact of the Thera explosion must have been colossal. Conventional wisdom holds that it took place at the same time as the destructions in Crete which have also been associated with the arrival ofthe Mycenaean Greeks on the island in around 1450 BC. One difficulty with this scheme, however, is that pottery on Crete before this destruction is of the style Late Minoan IB which, despite intensive search, has not been found below the volcanic deposits on Thera. Some archaeologists have therefore separated the two events, arguing that the eruption was some fifty years



42 BLACK ATHENA
earlier than the Mycenaean destruction, that is to say in about 1500 BC. I believe that the explosion took place even earlier, in 1626 BC, the precision of this date being based on dendrochronology - in this case, the counting of the tree rings of brisde-cone pines in the SouthWestern United States. Explosions on the scale of Krakatoa leave marks of summer frosts and stunted growth for several years on trees from near the snowline. Now there is no evidence from these aged brisde-cones of a world-shaking eruption in the 15th and 16th centuries BC, but there is for one in 1626. This was also a bad year for oaks in Ireland. Such a 'Krakatoa effect' could have been caused by another massive seismic event anywhere in the world; but, given the problem of finding a record of the Thera eruption, the identification would seem probable. IS There is, however, other evidence to back the higher or earlier date. Although volcanic gases appear to have distorted some of the carbon dates given for material found just below the destruction level, those from the short-lived plants - which provide the only accurate information-point to a I 7th- rather than a 15th-century date for the event. 19
In China, the fall ofJie, the last emperor of the Xia Dynasty, was accompanied by extraordinary events such as a yellow fog, frosts in summer, a dimming sun, and three suns at a time - all of which have been plausibly explained as resulting from Thera's dust cloud. The next problem, however, is the dating ofJie's fall. It could not have taken place in the 15th century: some historians put it in the 16th century and others before 1700. However, compilations based on ancient- 3rd-century-Bc - chronography and archaeological evidence indicate a date in the 17th century.20
Further indication ofan early date comes from Egypt, where the 15th century BC is very well documented. It would be surprising if an event on the scale of the Thera explosion, which must have affected Lower Egypt, should not have been recorded in some way. Furthermore, as we saw, Crete seems to have been sending tributary missions to Egypt at precisely this time, c.1450. There are, by contrast, virtually no Egyptian records from the 17th century, which would make it easier to explain the absence of any mention of the explosion. The huge scale of the
INTRODUCTION 43
catastrophe allows me to make an exception to my general opposition to from silence'. However, I acknowledge that this type of argument is inherendy weak. Furthermore, the dendrochronological, the carbon and the 'Chinese' datings are all open to doubt. Nevertheless, given the extreme weakness ofthe case for a 15th-century date, the four sources together make 1626 BC seem much more plausible. As there is now very little doubt that the eruption took place during the Late Minoan lA, some adjustment upwards ofthe absolute dates for a number of periods is required. The Cambridge Ancient History gives the chronological scheme using the standard periodization based on changing styles ofpottery:
Middle Minoan III, 1700- I 600; Late Minoan lA, 1600-1500; Late Minoan IB, 1500-1450.
The one proposed here is:
MM III, 173°-1650; LM lA, 1650-1550; LM IB, 1550-1450.
A revision of the Cretan ceramic periods would also require one for those of Mainland Greece, which were based on the Minoan ones and remain more or less correlated with them. In particular it would involve changing the dates ofthe Shaft Graves - first discovered by Schliemann at Mycenae - from the late to the early 17th century. To do so actually increases the difficulty for the Ancient Model, which maintained that the colonizations that began the heroic age were the result of the Egyptian exPulsion of the Hyksos in the 16th century. However, the 16th-century date also conflicts with the absence of Cretan archaeological evidence of a significant general destruction in this period, and it is very unlikely that the colonizers from Egypt would have bypassed the island. These incongruities with the archaeological evidence explain one of the two major revisions ofthe Ancient Model proposed in BlackAthena. The Revised Ancient Model maintains that the Egypto-West Semitic settlements in the Aegean started at the end of the 18th century Be, when the Hyksos first gained control ofLower Egypt, rather than in the 1570s, when their power there collapsed. If, for the moment, one accepts the revision, one is then left with the question of why the



44 BLACK ATHENA
Ancients, with their respect for Antiquity, should have lowered the date of the landings? One reason could have been the desire to associate them with the Egyptian expulsion of the Hyksos and the Israelite Exodus, which probably did take place in the early 16th century. Another factor could be underestimation through a wish to appear sober-minded and reasonable, for there is no reason why pressure in this direction should have been any less in Antiquity than it is today. Finally, the 'patriotic' feelings and the pun Hikesios/Hyksos could have been influences. It was less damaging to Greek pride to see the incomers as refugees or suppliants at the end ofthe Hyksos period than as conquerors arriving near its beginning. There is archaeological evidence that would fit very well with the hypothesis ofa Hyksos invasion ofthe Aegean soon after their arrival in Egypt. In the late 18th century BC there was a destruction of all the palaces in Crete, followed by their rebuilding in a slightly but significantly different way. There is thus a conventional demarcation at this break between the Early and Late Palace periods; among the changes are the introduction of swords, shaft graves and the royal motif of the griffin - all of which existed earlier in the Levant and became important in Mycenaean Greece. A sealing at this destruction level at Knossos shows a barbaric, bearded king of strongly Mycenaean appearance. Artistically, there are striking resemblances between Aegean objects ofMiddle Minoan III/Middle Helladic III, and objects found in Egypt in the Hyksos period and the early 18th Dynasty. The cultural flow is generally thought to be from the Aegean to Egypt; however, this is in some doubt because of the Levantine precedents for many of the most characteristic Mycenaean objects, techniques and motifs. To my mind, the most fruitful analogy for the great mixing of - at least - material cultures around the East Mediterranean in the late 18th and 17th centuries BC is that of the Pax Tartarica in the 13th century AD. In this the Mongol rulers brought about a mixing ofChinese, Persian and Arab techniques and art, introducing features ofone to another and breaking their more rigid conventions. In the case of the Hyksos, I postulate that long-established traditions, like those of Egypt and Crete, quickly recovered with some slight modification; but that in Mainland Greece,
INTRODUCTION 45
which lacked such a tradition, the eclectic 'Hyksos international style'
lasted rather longer. The hypothesis of a Hyksos Egypto-Canaanite conquest of Crete, and the establishment of colonies further north at the end of the 18th century, would provide a plausible scheme in which to fit the archaeological evidence I have mentioned. The Shaft Graves at Mycenae, which are full of new weapons and other objects showing foreign, largely Minoan and Near Eastern influence, could well be the tombs of the new conquerors. Indeed, the Cambridge ancient historian Professor Frank Stubbings maintained the same in his article on the Shaft Graves in the Cambridge Ancient History, though he accepts a 16th-century date and assures his readers that the Hyksos invaders had no lasting effect on Greek culture.ZI Since the article's publication in the 1960s, more evidence has emerged to strengthen his minority position. Recent archaeological discoveries at Tel ed Daba<a in the Eastern Delta, almost certainly the site of the Hyksos capital Avaris, have revealed a composite West SemiticEgyptian material culture showing clear resemblances to that of the Shaft Graves.zz The continuities in pottery styles in Mycenae from the Middle Bronze Age seem to indicate survival ofthe earlier culture at a relatively low social level. This is precisely what the linguistic evidence as interpreted by the Revised Ancient Model would suggest. It would also fit descriptions of the native Pelasgians having become Danaans or Athenians on instruction from the newcomers. It must be insisted, however, that this is not the only interpretation that can be given to the archaeological evidence. Even after the finds at Tel ed Daba<a, it is still possible to argue that Mycenaean material culture was the result of native Aegean chiefs becoming rich and powerful and importing foreign objects and craftsmen; or that Greek mercenaries returned from Egypt with wealth and a vision of the new styles. Despite the fact that there is no linguistic evidence or ancient authority to back these interpretations, they are followed by most contemporary archaeologists. As I have mentioned, there is also a school of thought that sees the radical change in Greek material culture at this point as the result of an
I

BLACK ATHENA
invasion without long-term results. In both cases, however, there is little doubt that the archaeologists have been heavily affected by non-archaeological arguments. Inevitably the majority ofscholars, who deny that there were any Hyksos settlements, have been influenced by the Aryan Model in which they are working. Similarly, the minority who believe in the settlements have been affected by the legends that make
up the Ancient Model. In both cases, it is quite clear that the objects themselves do not impose a single conceptual pattern. In good circumstances, archaeology may be able to provide fascinating and important information on population density, settlement size or local economy, but it is much too blunt a tool to give answers on its own to the questions with which BlackAthena is concerned.
Chapter III, 'River and mountain names', is the first chapter in Black Athena to concentrate on linguistic borrowing. It begins, therefore, with a discussion of the acknowledged phonetic correspondences between Egyptian, Semitic and Greek. Those between Egyptian and Semitic have been worked out in some detail, and a great deal of information about their correspondences with Greek can be deduced from the few admitted loan words and the hundreds of proper names transcribed in the other languages. From all this it is clear that there was an extraordinarily wide range ofphonetic correspondences; the wide variety ofways in which, for example, a Semitic or Egyptian word or name could be transcribed in Greek is quite bewildering. This variation can be explained partly by difficulties in hearing and reproducing foreign sounds, and by loaning through different regional dialects or third languages. However, the main source ofthe divergencies would seem to come from the extraordinarily long time-span over which the borrowing seems to have taken place. In the period from 2100 to 1100 Be - with which we are chiefly concerned - all three languages, and Egyptian in particular, went through radical sound shifts. Thus I argue that the same word or name could have been borrowed two or more times with very different results. The most useful analogy I have found here is with Japanese loans from Chinese over a similar period of about a millennium; in this case, however, the writing system allows one to see what the original word was, and it is the many differentJapanese 'readings' or
INTRODUCTION 47
pronunciations of the Chinese character that indicate the different
borrowings. Neither the Egyptian nor the West Semitic writing system indicated vowels. Some attempts at reconstructing them can be made from Coptic and the Masoretic vocalization of the Bible, as well as from cuneiform, Greek and other transcriptions of them. Nevertheless, many etymologies have to be made on the basis ofconsonantal structure alone. This - with the wide range of equivalences evident among the consonants themselves - creates an extraordinary number of possible phonetic correspondences between Egyptian, Semitic and Greek words and names. On the other hand, the fact that phenomena can be easily imagined has nothing to do with the likelihood of their actual occurrence. Furthermore, there are powerful external arguments in favour of massive linguistic borrowing having taken place. Even without the Ancient Model, there are the geographical and temporal proximities and the documentary and archaeological evidence of close contact. Added to these has been the failure of scholars working in the Aryan model over the last 160 years to explain 50 per cent of the Greek vocabulary and 80 per cent of proper names in terms of either
Indo-European or the Anatolian languages supposedly related to 'Pre-Hellenic'. In these circumstances I think it worthwhile to look for Egyptian and Semitic etymologies of Greek forms, but as rigorously as possible. First of all, I make no attempt to replace generally accepted Indo-European etymologies, even though some ofthese may well be wrong; the majority of the new ones proposed in this work have no orthodox competition. Even in such cases, however, one should still be extremely cautious. On the phonetic side one should be restricted to consonantal correspondences that are actually attested, even though it is very likely that others do occur. Similarly, there should be no metatheses - or switching of consonantal order. The one exception to this rule is the exchange of
liquids - Is and rs between 2nd and 3rd position. This is tolerated because it is extremely common in all three languages, particularly in Egyptian and Greek. Thus it would seem legitimate to derive the Greek martyr (witness) from the Egyptian mtrw (witness), or pyramis (pyramid) from the Egyptian PJ mr (the tomb) or (the pyramid). The main control



BLACK ATHENA
to avoid spurious derivations is, however, with semantics, where tight correspondences ofmeaning are required. The area of toponyms - place names - is one in which scholars working within the Aryan Model have been particularly lax in this respect. Any loose phonetic correspondence between a Greek and an Anatolian name has been considered sufficient to link the two regardless of whether they refer to an island, a mountain, a river or a town, let alone their geographical or legendary circumstances. This sloppiness has led the more rigorous to avoid the subject altogether, and nothing in this area has superseded the very sketchy work of the German Classical scholar A. Fick, published in 1905. This startling gap has been the inevitable result of the almost complete inability of Aryanist scholars to explain Aegean toponyms, because only a minute proportion of them are explicable in terms of Indo-European. All the Aryanists can do is to explain why they cannot explain them, and simply call them 'Pre-Hellenic'. Aryanists place great emphasis on the allegedly 'Pre-Hellenic' placename elements -(i)ssos and -nthos, which have never been given any meaning. This classification, first made by the German Classical linguist Paul Kretschmer, was developed by the American Classicist J. Haley and the archaeologist Carl Blegen, who argued that the distribution ofthese place names corresponded with Early Bronze Age settlements; and, further, that as the invaders were supposed to have arrived at the beginning ofthe Middle Bronze Age, they were indicators of Pre-Hellenic settlements. Archaeologically the theory is very flimsy, as the correspondences would hold as well for Late Bronze Age as for
Early Bronze Age sites. The toponymic aspect is equally feeble. Even before Haley and Blegen announced their theory, Kretschmer admitted that the suffixes could be attached to Indo-European roots, and therefore could not in themselves be indicators ofthe Pre-Hellenes - that is, ifone accepts the Aryan Model. As the suffixes also appear at the end of Semitic and Egyptian stems, they are equally unhelpful as indicators of an indigenous substratum when one is working within the Ancient Model. Given these obvious inadequacies, it might seem surprising that Blegen and Haley's hypothesis continues to be treated with so much
INTRODUCTION 49
respect. The explanation is that not even rubbish can be thrown away in a field so utterly barren as Ancient Greek toponymy. According to the Revised Ancient Model, -nthos has many different origins, the two most common being simple nasalization before dentals and the Egyptian -ntr (holy); -(i)ssos would seem to be a characteristic Aegean ending, but one that continued to be used at least until the end of the Bronze Age. As I said, Chapter III is concerned with river and mountain names. These are the toponyms that tend to be the most persistent in any country. In England, for instance, most are Celtic and some even seem to be pre-Indo-European. The presence ofEgyptian or Semitic mountain names would therefore indicate a very profound cultural penetration. The chapter cannot treat all my proposals in the area, but those considered include some very widely attested place names. Take, for instance, Kephisos or Kaphisos, the name of rivers and streams found all over Greece for which no explanation has been offered. I would derive it from Kbl)., a common Egyptian river name 'Fresh', with the suffix -isos. The semantic fit is excellent: Kbl}. is clearly linked to the words #(bJ (cool) and (purifY). The Greek Kephisoi were frequently used for purification rituals. had a subsidiary meaning: 'lake with wild fowl'. This would fit well with the great shallow Lake Kopais, which has many Egyptian connections in Greek tradition and is fed by a river, Kephisos. As far as I am aware, this etymology has never been proposed before. That of the Greek river name lardanos - which is found in Crete and the Peloponnese - from the Semitic Yarden orJordan was generally accepted before the onset of the Extreme Aryan Model. Even Beloch and Fick had to admit that the derivation was 'alluring' and could provide no alternatives. Nevertheless, it has been denied throughout the 20th century. Another Semitic etymology widely acknowledged before the late 19th century is that of the Greek toponymic element sam- as in Samos, Samothrace, Samikon, which always refers to high places, from the Semitic root Vsmm (high). This too has been neglected or denied. Other derivations proposed in this chapter require rather
more discussion. In Chapter IV I am concerned with city names. These are more



50 BLACK ATHENA
commonly transmitted from culture to culture than those of natural features. Nevertheless, the insignificant number of Indo-European city names in Greece, and the fact that plausible Egyptian and Semitic derivations can be found for most of them, suggests an intensity of contact that is impossible to explain in tenns of trade. One of the commonest clusters of Greek city names, for instance, is around the stem Kary(at). This could be plausibly explained in tenns of the standard West Semitic word for town - qrt - vocalized in different city
names in many ways, including Qart-, Qaret or Q!ryahlat. It is, in fact, one of the commonest Phoenician and Hebrew place names, seen in Carthage and many other cities. I give instances showing a strict parallel between the use ofKary- and that of the standard Greek word for 'city', polis. The most striking of these is the placing of the figures of Karyatids around the tomb of
Kekrops, the legendary founder of Athens, in a porch of the temple of Athena Polias. Thus, 'Daughters of the City' would seem a more plausible explanation for this name than 'Priestesses of Artemis from Karyai in Lakonia', or 'Nut Fairies', which are the only explanations given today. There are many variants ofthe stem Kary-, among which I include Korinthos (Corinth). N ear Corinth on the Isthmus was the city ofMegara. Pausanias, the Greek Baedeker ofthe 2nd century AD, explained the name as meaning 'cave' or 'subterranean chamber'. A West Semitic word with exactly this meaning appears in the Ugaritic place name Mgrt, and the biblical Mc<arah. These would seem plausible origins for the otherwise unexplained Greek city or city-ward names Megara and Meara. It is not well known that Ancient Egypt had a long tradition of bull-fighting, that is, of bull fighting bull. The fight - and the arena in which it took place - was called M!Wn. In Homer the word mothos accusative mothon - meant 'battle-din' and 'fight between animals'; while mothiin could mean 'licentious dance, a flute tune', or 'a young impudent fellow'. M!Wn was a common Egyptian place name; Mothone, Methone or Methana were almost equally frequent in Greece. These are all set on bays that could well be described as theatrical. It is therefore not surprising to find a coin from Mothone which portrays the port as a theatre, thus tying it clearly to M!WD.
INTRODUCTION 51
The traditional etymology for Mykenai (Mycenae) is from mykes, 'mushroom'. A more plausible candidate would seem to be from Mabaneh, 'Camp' or Mabanayim, 'Two Camps' - a common toponym in West Semitic. Then again, before the advent of the Extreme Aryan Model it was generally accepted that the Greek city name Thebai came from the Canaanite tebdh (ark, chest) which itself came from the Egyptian or dbt (box). These two were often confused with another and possibly related word db] (wicker float, ark of bulrushes) and til)]t (coffin, shrine) and hence (palace). Ob3, written Tbo or Thbo in Coptic, was an Egyptian city name. Interestingly, however, there is no record of its having been used for the southern capital ofEgypt which the Greeks called Thebai. Nevertheless, it may well have been used for the Hyksos capital at Avaris. Ifthis were the case, Ob3/Thebai could have become a Greek tenn or name for 'Egyptian capital', which was attached to the Egyptian Thebes when the 18th Dynasty established their capital there. In any event, there is no reason to doubt that the Greek city name came from the West Semitic tebdh and the Egyptian cluster mentioned above.
Chapter V is devoted to one city, Athens. In it I argue that both the city name Athenai and the divine name Athene or Athena derive from the Egyptian J:It Nt. In Antiquity, Athena was consistently identified with the Egyptian goddess Nt or Neit. Both were virgin divinities ofwarfare, weaving and wisdom. The cult ofNeit was centred on the city ofSais in the Western Delta, whose citizens felt a special affinity with the Athenians. Sais was a secular name, the city's religious title being J:It Nt (Temple or House of Neit). This name is not attested in Greek or Coptic, but the toponymic element I:It- is transcribed as At- or Ath-. It was also extremely common for Egyptian words to have what are called prothetic vowels before the first consonant. In this case the likelihood that Nt was preceded by a vowel is increased by the name <Anat, given to a very similar West Semitic goddess; hence it would seem legitimate to propose a vocalization of *Atanait for I:It Nt. The lack of i in Athene, Athana in the Doric dialect and A-ta-na in Linear B would
,. is the convention used to denote hypothesized but unattested forms of a word or name.



BLACK ATHENA
seem to be a problem. However, Attic and Doric have the variants Athenaia and Athanaia, while the full Homeric form is Athenaie. And as final -ts were dropped in both Greek and Late Egyptian, the letter's non-appearance in Athenai and Athene should be expected. If the phonetic fit is good, the semantic one is perfect. As I have said, the Ancients saw Neit and Athena as two names for the same deity. In Egypt it was normal for a divinity to be addressed by the name ofher or his dwelling, and this would explain the Greek confusion between the names of the goddess and her city. Finally there is the statement, by Charax of Pergamon in the 2nd century AD,. that 'the Saitians called their city Athenai', which makes sense only ifthey saw I:It Nt as a name for Sais.23 Chapter V goes on to look at iconographic connections between Neit and Athena. Neit had been symbolized since Pre-dynastic times as a cockroach on a stick, from which it developed into a figure 8 shield often associated with weapons. This symbolism would seem to be the origin ofthe so-called 'Shield Goddess' found in Minoan Crete, which in tum is generally linked to a painted limestone plaque, found at Mycenae, showing the arms and neck ofa goddess coming from behind a figure 8 shield. Now this image has been seen as an early representation of the Palladion, a standing suit of armour associated with the cult of Pallas Athena, as well as with the goddess herself. In this way, then, one can trace an iconographic development from Egypt in the 4th and 3rd millennia Be, through Crete and Mycenae in the 2nd, to the wellknown goddess of the 1st - which corresponds precisely with the legendary association between Neit and Athena and the etymology here. Furthermore, the high point in the state cult of Athena in Athens was at the same time in the mid-6th century that Amasis, the Saite pharaoh of Egypt, was promoting her worship elsewhere in the East Mediterranean. Sais was on the frontier of Egypt and Libya and was sometimes part Libyan, which explains Herodotos' detailed description of Athena's association with Libya; it is also clear that this first great Greek historian thought the Egyptians and some Libyans were black. On the other hand, the earliest Greek representation of Athena is that from Mycenae, in which her limbs are painted, in line with the Minoan convention
INTRODUCTION 53
taken from Egypt - of representing men as redlbrown and women as yellow/white. Nevertheless, it is the conjunction of NeitlAthena's Egypto-Libyan origins, Herodotos' awareness of the connection, and his portrayal of the Egyptians as black, that has inspired the title ofthis series.
Chapter VI is exclusively concerned with Sparta. I see this place name as one of a large cluster, including such variants as Spata and Sardis, to be found all over the Aegean basin. I believe that they should all be derived directly or indirectly from the Egyptian toponym Sp(3)(t) (nome) or 'District and its Capital'. In Old and Middle Egyptian the 'vulture' sign represented here as 3was heard as a liquid r/l; in Late Egyptian it merely modified other vowels. In Egypt the Sp(3)(t) par excellence was one near Memphis dedicated to Anubis the Jackal, messenger of death and guardian of the dead. I maintain that this link persisted in at least Sardis and Sparta, for Spartan or Lakonian culture is full ofcanine associations. These include the other name for Sparta, Lakedaimon, which can be plausibly explained as the 'Howling/Gnawing Spirit', an epithet altogether appropriate for Anubis and an exact calque for Kanob/pos, K3 >Inpw, 'Spirit of Anubis', the name of the westernmost mouth of the Nile. In Greek myth Kanopos had close associations with Sparta, and both were seen as entries to the Underworld. Hence I also investigate the religious importance of Anubis' Greek counterpart Hermes in Lakonia and the special Spartan concern with canines, the Underworld and death, all of which I am convinced can be traced back to the Bronze Age. The last section of the chapter is devoted to Egyptian influences on Iron Age Sparta. The fact that much of the uniquely Spartan political vocabulary can be plausibly derived from Late Egyptian is linked to the tradition that the Spartan lawgiver Lykourgos visited the East and Egypt to study their institutions. Moreover, the notion of Egyptian cultural influence there in the 9th and 8th centuries is strengthened by the strikingly Egyptian appearance ofearly Spartan art. All these link up with the Spartan kings' belief in their Heraklid - hence Egyptian or Hyksos - ancestry; and would thus explain such anomalies in the Aryan Model as the building of a pyramid at the Menelaion, the Spartan



54 BLACK ATHENA
'national' shrine, and the letter one ofthe last Spartan kings wrote to the High Priest inJerusalem, claiming kinship with him.
Chapter VII returns the reader to linguistics, with a survey of the arguments for and against there being a genetic relationship between Afroasiatic and Indo-European languages. Here I come out clearly for the minority position taken by A. R. Bornhard, A. B. Dolgopolskii, Carleton Hodge and the other linguists who believe that there must have been a common proto-language for both families. I also believe that there may well have been loans from Semitic and Egyptian before the disintegraton of Proto-Indo-European at the tum of the 3rd millennium. Both these conclusions complicate my task considerably, however, as resemblances between Egyptian and West Semitic words on the one hand, and Greek ones on the other, cannot simply be attributed to loaning in the 2nd millennium; they could be the result not only ofcoincidence but ofgenetic relationships or much earlier borrowings. The best way to control for this is to see whether similar words are found in Teutonic, Celtic and Tokharian -languages remote from the Middle East and therefore relatively unlikely to have borrowed from Afroasiatic. Even with these, however, one can never be certain.
Chapter VIII is entided 'Common features in Ancient Near Eastern languages, including Greek'. Since the discovery of Indo-European,historical linguistics has been largely concerned with the ramifications and differentiations oflanguage families. Where similarities have been perceived among neighbouring but 'unrelated' languages, these Sprachbunden are usually attributed to ancient 'substrates' underlying the later languages. In recent years, however, some linguists have begun to look at linguistic convergence among adjacent, genetically unrelated languages: that is to say, language changes taking place across linguistic frontiers. Take, for instance, the fashionable French r, diffused into German and the upper-class English affected mispronunciation of the sound. Then there is the tendency to replace the simple past tense by a compound one, which seems to have spread from French to adjacent dialects of German, Italian and Spanish. These changes not only indicate dose contact but also reflect the high political and cultural
INTRODUCTION 55
prestige of France between the 17th and 19th centuries, when the linguistic changes took place. Chapter VIII is concerned with the possibility that such processes took place in the Ancient Near East. It is argued, for instance, that although the shift from initial s- to initial h- has happened in many languages, including Welsh, its occurrence in Greek, Armenian and Iranian should be linked to that in the contiguous Anatolian language Lycian, and the Semitic Canaanite and Aramaic. This development seems to have taken place in the 2nd millennium because it is not present in older languages of the region like Eblaite, Akkadian and Hittite. Furthermore, in Ugaritic texts dating from the 14th and 13th centuries the process appears to have begun but is not complete. Another 2nd-millennium development was that of the definite article, a feature which is not so common among world languages as one might suppose. It is attested only in Indo-European and Afroasiatic languages, and in every case the definite article is a weakened form of a native demonstrative. Still, this does not exclude the possibility of the concept's having been borrowed. The definite article appears first in Late Egyptian, in what seems to be the colloquial of the 19th century Be. It does not exist in U garitic or early biblical poetry, but is present in Phoenician and biblical prose. Given the Egyptian Empire in the Levant in the 15th and 14th centuries, it would seem plausible to suggest that this - and other characteristically 'Canaanite' linguistic changes - took place then as a result of Egyptian influence. Greece, for its part, seems to have developed the definite article a litde later. There is no trace of it in the Linear B texts and titde in Homer; it is, however, present in the earliest Iron Age prose, and the fact that the Greek article is used in a number of ways peculiar to it and to Canaanite suggests that the idea was borrowed from the Levant. As is well known, Latin has no definite article but all its descendants do; and it was widespread in vulgar Latin, presumably as a result of its use in Greek, Punic and Aramaic, the next most influentiallanguages in the Roman Empire. Its later spread through the Teutonic and Western Slav languages can be traced historically. It is only with the hypotheses of a genetic relationship between Afroasiatic and Indo-European, and areal features resulting from



56 BLACK ATHENA
convergence, that one can explain such 'coincidences' as the remarkable similarity between the Hebrew ha (the) and the Greek nominative forms ofthe word, ho and he. Both Afroasiatic and Indo-European had a demonstrative *'se. Both Greek and Canaanite seem to have transformed initial s- into h-, and both developed definite articles out of demonstratives. There may have been a direct influence or 'contamination' from the Semitic to the Greek forms, but the latter is too well-rooted in Indo-European to be considered as a loan. An even more intricate pattern of convergence can be seen in the breakdown of the long aor a, in many phonetic contexts, which took place in much ofthe region in the second halfofthe 2nd millennium. In Egypt and Canaan it shifted to long o. But in Ugaritic in the Northern Levant, Lycian in Southern Anatolia, and the Ionian of East Greece but not the other Greek dialects, where the long aremained - it became long e. This distribution of 0 and e corresponds well with the known political division of the period between the Egyptian and Hittite empires and spheres ofinfluence.1t is particularly interesting because it cuts across the historical and genetic linguistic boundaries of West Semitic and Greek. Such widespread changes in the 2nd millennium BC indicate a degree of contact in the East Mediterranean that is not generally recognized, and indicates the political and!or cultural
influence of Egypt and Canaan.
'Labiovelars in Semitic and Greek' is the topic of Chapter IX. Labiovelars are sounds like qu- in which a velar like k or g is followed by a rounding of the lips or a w. It is generally recognized that such sounds existed in Proto-Indo-European, but there is no general recognition that this is the case with Proto-Semitic. However, labiovelars are common throughout the rest ofAfroasiatic and in Semitic languages of Ethiopia. In this chapter, I argue that in many respects it is much more useful to reconstruct Proto-Semitic on the basis of some South Ethiopic Semitic languages than from Arabic, as is done at present. In particular, I claim - on the grounds of evidence from these languages themselves - that Asiatic Semitic had labiovelars and that West Semitic retained them well into the 2nd millennium. Since it is generally agreed that the Greek labiovelars broke down during the middle ofthat period,
INTRODUCTION 57
I argue that some loans from Semitic into Greek were made when both had labiovelars, some after Greek had dropped them but West Semitic still retained them, and some after they had disappeared from both. Thus, postulating considerable contact between West Semitic and Greek culture before the breakdown of the labiovelars - that is to say, before the middle of the 2nd millennium BC - can resolve a number of otherwise inexplicable problems in Greek etymology. It also illustrates how much the Revised Ancient Model can achieve from using the abundant Greek material to help in the reconstruction ofearly forms in Egyptian and Semitic.
In this summary I can cite only two examples of this. The first is that of the famous Phoenician city known as Gublu(m) in Eblaite and Akkadian, G9Jal in Hebrew, andJebeil in Arabic. Given my beliefin the West Semitic retention oflabiovelars, I think it plausible to postulate an early pronunciation *'Gweb(a)l, which could explain these variants. By contrast, the Greek name for the city is Byblos or Biblos. This puzzle can be solved by postulating that the name was known in the Aegean before the middle of the 2nd millennium. As it is known that in most dialects the Greek gWi became bi after the breakdown ofthe labiovelars, it would seem plausible to suggest that the name *'Gweb(a)l was in use in Greek as *'Gwibl while that language still possessed labiovelars, and then, following the normal sound shifts, became Biblos or Byblos. The second example is the puzzling name of Demeter. From Ethiopic and West Semitic evidence it is possible to reconstruct the early forms *'gWe and *gWay, meaning 'land' or 'wide valley'. If this
word had been introduced into Greek before the breakdown of the labiovelars and had gone through the regular sound shifts, gWe would have become *de. This could explain why the Greek earth mother goddess was called Demeter and not *Gemeter, a question that has tantalized scholars for two millennia. There are problems with the vocalization, and the fact that the name does not appear in Linear B; nevertheless, in the absence of any alternative it remains a plausible explanation, and one which is reinforced by the existence of the rare word gyes (measure of land). Gyes would seem to be a loan from Canaanite into Greek after labiovelars had broken down in Greek, but before the shift had taken place in Canaanite. Finally, after labiovelars



58 BLACK ATHENA
had disappeared from both languages, the Greek gaia and gi (earth), which have no explanation from Indo-European, would seem to have been borrowed from the Canaanite, gaf), which in the 'construct' or modified form is pronounced ge) .
Chapters X and XI are concerned with linguistic borrowings from West Semitic and Egyptian, and here I shall start by discussing the two chapters together. In both, some reference is made to syntax or word order, as for instance the similar uses of the definite article in Late Canaanite - Phoenician and Hebrew - on the one hand and Greek on the other. Elsewhere morphology or word modification is considered; but most of the chapters are devoted to studying lexical borrowings or loan words. We begin here with morphology, or the modification of words with number, gender, case, tense and so on. With the exception of Hittite Greek is the earliest attested Indo-European language, and this makes the degree of its morphological 'decay' very remarkable. For although the original Indo-European verbal system appears to have been very well preserved in Greek, in Greek had only five cases while Latin, first recorded over 1,000 years later, had six; and Lithuanian, written down only in modem times, has retained all of the eight postulated for Proto-Indo-European. The morphological loss experienced by Greek would suggest intensive contact with other languages; this tallies with the lexical evidence and weakens Model of Autochthonous Origin. However, it can be explained by both the Ancient and Aryan models which, unlike the first, can explain just such contact. The major concern of these two chapters, however, is with verbal loans. As I have mentioned, the Indo-European component of the Greek lexicon is relatively small. For instance languages like Old Church Slavonic and Lithuanian, which are first attested 2,000 years later than Greek, have a considerably higher proportion of roots with cognates in other Indo-European languages. Further, the semantic range in which the Indo-European roots appear in Greek is very much the same as that of Anglo-Saxon roots in English. These roots provide most pronouns and prepositions; most of the basic nouns and verbs of
INTRODUCTION 59
family - though not political - life; and of subsistence - though not commercial - agriculture. By contrast, the vocabulary of urban life, luxury, religion, administration and abstraction is non-Indo-European. Such a pattern usually reflects a long-term situation in which speakers of the language or languages which provide the words of higher culture control the users of the basic lexicon - as in the relationships between Anglo-Saxon and French in English; Bantu and Arabic in the creation of Swahili; or Vietnamese and Chinese in the formation ofModern Vietnamese. A less common pattern is that seen in Turkish and Hungarian, in which the conquerors took over the sophisticated vocabulary of the natives. In these cases, however, Turks and Hungarians retained their own or Mongol words for military technology or organization. In Greek, however, the words for chariot itself, sword, bow, march, armour, battle, etc., are non-Indo-European. Hence Greek, as pictured in the Aryan Model, does not resemble languages of the Turkish type. Thus, to accept the Aryan Model, it is necessary to postulate Greek as a language that is typologically unique. The Ancient Model would place Greek, with English and Vietnamese, in the commonest category of such mixed languages.
To tum now to each of the two chapters. Chapter X looks at Greek borrowings from West Semitic. In this area I can follow not only the scholarship from before the triumph of the Aryan Model, but also that of scholars in the last two decades who have been cautiously and soundly restoring the earlier etymologies and even adding some oftheir own. Despite this progress, however, we are still far from the situation as it was before the onset of the Extreme Aryan Model. For instance, as I mentioned above, the embargo on Semitic loans never included spices and Oriental luxuries. But the proposals by Semitists of equally plausible etymologies from more sensitive semantic regions, such as bomos from bdmdh - both meaning 'high place' or 'altar' - are still generally rejected by Classicists.
Other examples of the West Semitic etymologies for religious terms put forward in this chapter include the Greek haima, a word that in Homer had overtones of 'spirit' and 'courage', as well as having its standard sense of'blood'. The first two meanings are reflected in Greek science, where haima was seen as the equivalent of air and not - as one



60 BLACK ATHENA
might expect - water. It is argued that haima derives from the Canaanite (life); in Canaanite religion blood was seen as the repository of life. As a second example, there is the extremely well-known Semitic root 'Iqds (sacred); semantically, this tallies very well with the Greek cluster ofwords around kudos, meaning 'divine glory'. Interestingly, too, qds in the sense of 'apart, unclean' seems to be reflected in the Greek kudos (vile) and kuJo,zo (revile). Another cluster ofwords with religious significance, that around naio (dwell) and naos (dwelling, temple or shrine), would seem to come from the Semitic root Ynwh, which has the same general and specific connotations. The derivation ofnektar from a Semitic *niqtar (smoked or perfumed wine, etc.) was widely accepted before the onset of the Extreme Aryan Model, and has recently been revived by Professor Saul Levin. Looking at the abstract vocabulary, there is the Greek stem kosm, from which we derive not only our 'cosmos' but our 'cosmetics'. Its basic meaning is to 'distribute' or 'arrange'. The Semitic root Yqsm covers the semantic range 'divide, arrange and decide'. Then again, Canaanite sem (mark, name) seems to have been borrowed into Greek twice; first as sema (sign, mark, token), and later - probably from the form fem - as schema (form, shape, figure, configuration). In politics, too, there are such word clusters as the Greek deil- (wretched) and doul(client) or (slave), which could well come from the Canaanite ddl or dal (dependent, reduced) or (poor); while the Greekxenos (stranger) would seem to derive from the West Semitic Ysn} (hate, enemy)__ In the military sphere we find such etymologies as phasgan- (sword) or (blade) from the Semitic root Vpsg (cleave), and hanna (chariot) or (tackle), from the Semitic root YQrm (net). Finally, there are some basic Greek words which appear to have Semitic etymologies; for instance, mechri(s) (up to, as far as) would seem to come from the Semitic root Ymvr (be in front, come to meet). It is true that none of these derivations is certain; but they are all more or less plausible. In the absence of competing Indo-European etymologies, and in the light of all the other evidence in favour of Semitic influence on 2nd- and 1st-millennium Greece, they should be given very serious consideration. The same is true of the Egyptian etymologies proposed in Chapter
INTRODUCTION
XI. Unlike the study of Semitic etymologies, research into Egyptian loan words in Greek has never been seriously developed. The simple reason for this is that hieroglyphics were deciphered only as the Ancient Model was coming to an end. By the 1860s, when dictionaries of Ancient Egyptian were first published, the Aryan Model was so firmly established that comparison between the two vocabularies was impossible within academia. The only exception to this were the bold and fruitful attempt made by the Abbe Barthelemy in the 18th century to compare Greek words with Coptic. Today, with the three anomalies of bans (a type of small boat), xiphos (sword) and makar- (blessed), no Greek word of any significance has been allowed an Egyptian etymology, and the latter two were widely questioned. Two short articles in 1969 collected and ratified a number of obviously exotic words, with plausible Egyptian origins; but, as with West Semitic, these could easily have been transmitted by trade or casual contact and were therefore acceptable to the Aryan Model. In 197I an even more negative piece appeared, denying some and casting doubt on others of the few established Egyptian etymologies.24
I have stressed the importance of military vocabulary, so the derivation of xiphos from the Egyptian sft (knife, sword) is therefore very significant. It means that there is one Semitic and one Egyptian etymology for the two Greek words for sword, both admitted to be non-Indo-European - the sword being the new wonder weapon of the 'heroic' Late Bronze Age. Other instances worth mentioning here include makar- which comes from the Egyptian ml brw (true ofvoice), the title given to the blessed dead who have passed the test of judgement. Other Greek legal terms would seem to have equally plausible Egyptian etymologies, while we have already come across the derivation of martyr from mtrw (witness). The stem tima- (honour) in both warfare and law probably comes from an Egyptian *dt ml attested in Demotic as tyml, meaning (render true, justify).
In politics, while there is a widespread and fundamental IndoEuropean root Vreg meaning 'rule' or 'king' which is found in the Indian rajah, the Gaulish rix, the Latin rex, and the Irish ri, the Ancient Greek words for king had nothing to do with this but were (w)anax and basileus. The former, which will be discussed in Chapter I of this
.J



BLACK ATHENA
volume, would seem to come from the Egyptian formula (no 4t (may he live for ever!) used after the names of living pharaohs. In early Greek a basileus was not a king but an official subordinate to the (w)anax. In Egyptian PJ sr (the official) became a standard title for the vizier. It has been found transcribed in Akkadian as pa-fi-i-a-(ra). As p and b were not distinguished in late Egyptian, and Egyptian r was frequently rendered I in Greek, there is no phonetic difficulty to impede the
perfect semantic fit. The Egyptian origin of the Greek sophia (wisdom) is described in Chapter I of this volume. All these etymologies in the areas of power, abstraction and sophistication tally with the pattern suggested by the Ancient Model of Egyptian rulers over a less developed native population. As with Semitic, however, other loan words suggest an even deeper penetration into Greek life. There is no reason to doubt that the Greek chera (widow) comes from the Egyptian !1.3rt (widow), or that the particle gar derives from the Egyptian grt, which has the same and syntactic position. As I have mentioned, final ts were dropped In
both Late Egyptian and Greek. The conclusion of Greece European or Levantine? is that while the documentary and archaeological evidence tends to support the Ancient Model over the Aryan one, it is not conclusive. By contrast, that from language and names of all sorts strongly supports the intrinsically plausible case for the ancient tradition, for the scale and centrality ofthe lexical and nominal borrowing would suggest massive and sustained Egyptian cultural influence on Greece. Although the Japanese case shows that borrowings on such a large scale need not be the result of conquest, conquest or colonization is the usual way in which arise. The linguistic evidence, then, strongly supports the Ancient
Model. Taking all classes of evidence together, there is no way in which the Aryan Model has superior heuristic value. Given the case - made in Volume I of Black Athena - that the supersession of the Aryan Model over the Ancient can be explained in terms ofthe Weltanschauung ofthe early 19th century, there is no need to retain it. In short, as I have said elsewhere in this book, Volume I shows that the Aryan Model was 'conceived in sin'. Volume 2 will show that it is bankrupt.
INTRODUCTION
SOLVING THE RIDDLE OF THE
SPHINX AND OTHER STUDIES
IN EGYPTO-GREEK MYTHOLOGY
Volume 3 of Black Athena is an attempt to use the Revised Ancient Model to throw some light on previously inexplicable aspects of Greek religion and mythology, and especially on the names ofheroic or divine beings. The chapters are set out in what seems to be the chronological order of the various cults that arrived in Greece; like everything in this area, however, the sequence is very uncertain. The first chapter is concerned with the earliest discernible religious influence - that of the 11th-dynasty royal cult of the hawk/bull god Mn!W or Mont in the 2 I st century Be - on the establishment of the Cretan bull-cult at the same time as the foundation ofthe palaces there in the same century. I argue that the lack of evidence of a bull-cult in Crete in the Early Minoan period, in the 3rd millennium, makes it very unlikely that there is any continuity from the bull-cult found in 7th-millennium Anatolia. Furthermore, mountainous Crete can in no way be considered natural cattle country. Apart from the sudden appearance ofthe bull-cult there, the coincidence oftiming, the known expansion of Egyptian influence during the reigns of the various pharaohs named Mentl).otpe of the 11th Dynasty, and the archaeological evidence of contacts between Egypt and the Aegean at this time, there is also legendary evidence to suggest Egyptian influence on Crete at this point. I believe that the names of both the god Mn!W and the pharaoh Mentl).otpe are reflected in that given in Greek legends to an ancient judge, lawgiver and subduer of the Greek islands, Rhadamanthys, whose name can be plausibly derived from an Egyptian *Rdi M(a)n!W, 'Mn!W gives'. Rhadamanthys was also the warlike stepfather of Herakles, who taught the hero how to shoot; Mn!W was the god of archery. Mn!W was associated with the goddess R<t, whose name we know, from Mesopotamian sources, to have been vocalized Ria. This would then seem a very plausible origin for the name of the goddess Rhea, who played a central role in Cretan religion. The cult of Mn!W was not the only Egyptian bull-cult to reach the Aegean. I think it is plausible to associate the legendary figure ofMinos,



BLACK ATHENA
the first king and lawgiver ofCrete, with Menes - or Min, as Herodotos called him - the first lawgiver and pharaoh of Egypt, who should be dated to about 3250 BC. Min was credited in Antiquity with having founded the bull-cult ofApis at Memphis. Another Egyptian bull-cultcalled Mnevis by the Romans - has been plausibly derived from an Egyptian form *Mnewe. This cult had been associated with 'winding walls' since the Old Kingdom, hundreds ofyears before the first Cretan palaces were constructed. Thus we have a triple coincidence: in Egypt there were two bull-cults associated with the names Min and Mnewe; the first was the name ofthe royal founder, and the second was linked to a 'winding wall'; in Crete there was a bull-cult associated with the founder King Minos and a labyrinth! Greek tradition was clear on the point that the labyrinth was copied for King Minos from an Egyptian original by the great craftsman and architect Daidalos. Attempts to derive the name labyrinth from an alleged Lydian word labrys meaning 'axe' seem less plausible than the etymology proposed by Egyptologists in the 1860s - and denied by those of the 20th century - from a reconstructed Egyptian place name *R-pr-r-hnt, for the site of the great Egyptian labyrinth described by Herodotos and other ancient
writers. Bull-cults deriving not only from that ofMn!W but also from those of Min, Mnevis, and Apis occurred throughout Greece, but were eclipsed by those of goats and rams. At or near the beginning of the 12th Dynasty, the Egyptian royal cult changed from that of the hawklbull Mn!W to one of the ram Amon. As I have mentioned, the 12th-dynasty pharaohs named and S-n Wsrt, can be plausibly identified with the mighty conquerors Memnon and Sesostris ofGreek tradition, have now been shown by inscriptional evidence to have carried out wide-ranging expeditions in the East Mediterranean. Thus I argue in Chapter II that the widespread oracular ramigoat-cults
found throughout the Aegean basin began to be introduced soon after they rose to prominence in Egypt itselfin the 20th century BC. In Egypt the cults were associated with both Amon and Osiris, and in the Aegean with Zeus and Dionysos, who were seen as their Greek equivalents. The natural confusion between the rams and goats seems to have been compounded by the fact that the oracular cult at the Delta city
INTRODUCTION 65
known to the Greeks as Mendes - was associated with a well-endowed species of ram that - rather embarrassingly for a symbol of fertility _ became extinct. In later centuries this was represented in a way that led Herodotos, at least, to describe it alternately as a goat and a ram. Dodona, in North-West Greece, was generally conceded to be the most ancient oracle of this type; according to Herodotos and other Greek writers it had been established from the oracles at Siwa, an oasis in the Libyan desert, and Thebes, with its oracular cult ofAmon. Archaeology has confirmed remarkable parallels between Dodona and Siwa. Furthermore, the cult ofAmon in Siwa was associated with the deity Ddwn, which would seem to be the origin of the otherwise inexplicable name Dodona.
The confusion between Zeus and Dionysos was particularly great in Crete - where Zeus was supposed to have died - and the northern
of Greece, from Dodona in the west to Thrace and Phrygia far to the east. These regions, which on other grounds can be shown to have been particularly conservative, would seem to have preserved an undifferentiated cult that was superseded by the more specific ones that were introduced or grew up later. Nevertheless, many cult centres -like that ofZeus at Olympia - preserved elements ofthe earlier stratum. At the end of the section on ramlgoat-cults I consider the parallels between the acting-out ofOsiris' passion or drama in Egyptian religion and the origins of Greek theatre. It is striking to note that in Greece, tragedy, which was essentially religious, was associated with both Dionysos and the goat, tragos.
Chapter III of Solving the Riddle ofthe Sphinx is called 'Beauty' and is concerned with the goddess Aphrodite. Her name was traditionally derived from the word aphros (foam); no explanation has been offered for the otherwise unknown suffix -dite. The Classical image of the goddess rising from the foam shows that the tradition is ancient. Nevertheless it would seem to me to be a pun or a folk etymology, the true one almost certainly coming from the Egyptian Pr W3Qyt (House of
W3Qyt). This name, given to two cities - one in the Nile Delta, later known to the Greeks as Bouto/os, and the other in Upper Egypt, called Aphroditopolis - demonstrates the identification of W3Qyt with



66 BLACK ATHENA
Aphrodite. I have already mentioned the Egyptian aSSocIatIOn of divinities with their dwellings, in connection with Athena; in this case, however, the use of Pr W3Qyt as a form of address has been attested. Phonetically there are some problems, as there is no other case where the r in pr has been preserved; though if it had, the prefixing of a 'prothetic' ali would be automatic. In any event, the derivation from *aPr-W3Qyt is clearly better phonetically than that from aphros. Semantically, the case for deriving Aphrodite from Pr W3ID't is very strong indeed. W3ID't was a goddess of fertility and she was associated with the new growth after the Flood, just as Aphrodite was with spring and youthful love; W3Qyt was also associated with the snakes that emerged in that season. It so happens that one of the most remarkable Egyptian finds from Middle Minoan Crete is the base of a statue of a priest of W3Qyt. What is more, the hieroglyphs are so irregular as to suggest that they may have been engraved locally. In any event, the find suggests that the cult existed on the island at that time. It is striking, therefore, to find several figures from this period of a beautiful and alluring goddess holding two snakes, figures which a number of scholars have tentatively linked to Aphrodite. The cult seems to have flourished towards the end of Middle Minoan, so it would seem plausible to date the goddess's introduction tentatively to the wave of Egypto-Levantine-Minoan influence around the 'Hyksos' invasions at the end of the 18th and the beginning ofthe 17th century Be.
'Beauty' is followed by Chapter IV: 'and the Beast'. Its topic is Seth or Sutekh, the god to whom the Hyksos were supposed to have been devoted. In Egyptian theology Seth was the divinity ofthe outside, ofthe deserts and their wild and unpredictable and, according to Plutarch, he was the god of the sea. There seems every reason to suppose that just as the Hyksos conquest can be identified with the biblical sojourn in Egypt, the Hyksos Seth was the Israelite Yahwe, the god of the wilderness, of volcanos and of the tumultuous seas. In Ugaritic myth, the enemy of the fertility god Ba<al was Yam, 'Sea', who would then appear to be another Semitic counterpart. In Hellenistic times Seth was rendered Typhon but, unlike all the other Egyptian gods, he lacked a Greek divine counterpart. The reason for this seems
J
INTRODUCTION
obvious: by then, Seth as the epitome ofevil could not be equated with a respectable divinity. On the other hand, the only major Greek god lacking an Egyptian counterpart was Poseidon. I maintain that the two loose ends should be tied together. Both deities were concerned with the sea, earthquakes, hunting, chariots and horses, and were generally cantankerous. Just as the Hyksos were devoted to Seth, Poseidon was the god most frequently referred to in the Linear B tablets from Mycenaean Crete and Greece. Alternative forms with a t, such as Poteidon, have led Indo-Europeanists to identify the name with the root Vpot 'power'. However, it is difficult to link the suffix -d(e)on to dios (divine). To someone working in the Ancient Model the alternation sit suggests the Semitic letter which seems to have been a form ofts. The etymology I propose for Poseidon is p3(W) or Pr Sidon, 'He of or 'House of Sidon'. Sid, the patron god of Sidon, derived his name from the root 'to hunt'. He was a divinity of hunting, fishing, chariots and the sea; thus the semantic fit is perfect. The difficulty with the derivation, however, is that it requires an Egypto-Semitic form of a type that has so far not been attested; therefore I can propose the etymology only tentatively. But whether or not it can be accepted, I believe that I can show striking parallels between Seth and Poseidon, and these are particularly interesting precisely because the two were not identified in Classical times. Similarities between the two gods and their cults, therefore, cannot be attributed to later 'Egyptianizing'.
Chapter V, 'The terrible twins', is concerned with the twins Apollo and Artemis. In Egypt the sun was worshipped in many different ways - as Ra, as Aten the solar disc, and as Ijprr and Tm, the young sun in the morning and the old sun at night, respectively. Phonetically, the only problem with the derivation ofApollo from Ijprr is that bis very seldom transcribed as 0. Such a borrowing would be possible, on the other hand, if the introduction were late and had come through Phoenician, in which the b merged with the softer l}., quite often rendered as 0 in Greek. As it happens, there are two indications that this is, in fact, the case. Lateness is suggested by the fact that the name Apollo is not attested in Linear B; and Phoenician transmission by the vocalization



68 BLACK ATHENA
CaCoC, suggesting that the name had passed through the 'Canaanite shift' ii> o. Semantically, the derivation of Apollo from Ijprr would seem very good. Ijprr was identified with I:Ir m 31}.t, the Greek Harmachis, 'Horus ofthe Rising Sun'. Horus had been identified with Apollo at least from the time of the poet Pindar in the 5th century, but this dawning aspect would seem the most appropriate for Apollo, who was always seen as young. The central myth concerning Horus was of his struggle with, and victory over, Seth manifested as a water monster. In Greece a major myth of Apollo was that of Delphi, where the young god, accompanied by his sister Artemis, killed the Python. I argue that Delphi, like adelphos (brother), comes from a Semitic word for 'couple' or 'twin'. Thus Apollo's title Delphinios is a doublet of another, Didymos 'twin', and Apollo's 'twinness' seems essential to his nature. Modern historians of Greek religion are moving away from the idea that Apollo's twin sister Artemis was exclusively a moon goddess. It is now thought that she was a virgin, huntress goddess ofthe evening and night. In Hellenistic times Artemis was seen as the counterpart of the Egyptian cat goddess BJstt, who Was identified with the moon. However, B3stt also had a fiery aspect and as such was supposed to help in the destruction ofHorus' enemies. In this capacity she was seen as a lioness and identified as the female counterpart ofRa and Tm, the god of the evening sun. Ijprr and Tm together formed the twin aspects of I:Ir 3l).twy 'Horus of the (Two) Horizons', who was the equivalent of Ra. Tm's consort Tmt/B3stt seems to have had some independence, and from the middle ofthe 3rd millennium she was connected with the two lion goddesses linked to Horus of the (two) horizons. Horus' greatest monument in Egypt was the Sphinx at GizCJ. Although the monument is only of a single lion, a dedication inserted near it in the late 15th century, over 1,000 years after its construction, refers to I:Ir 31}.twy and to I:Ir(i) Tm, which almost certainly refers to Tm himself. On phonetic grounds, a feminine form *I:Irt Tmt would provide a good etymology for Artemis. The correspondence of an Egyptian final -t with a Greek final -is is common; the medial t would drop with the normal development of Egyptian; and the vocalization ofI:Ir as (1:l)ar is amply attested, as is the modification of the Egyptian I). to 0. Thus the 'twinness' of
'I.
INTRODUCTION
Apollo and Artemis can be seen to be that of IJprr and Tm, that between the morning and the evening sun.
Chapter V goes on to investigate the reasons for the sex change, and also the parallels between Apollo and Artemis and Kadmos and Europa, whose names come from the Semitic Yqdm (east) and Y<rb (west) and (evening). The cults and myths of the Greek Thebes are particularly important in this respect because they too are associated with the Sphinx, adding to the intricate network linking them to this aspect ofEgyptian solar religion. I argue that the Theban Sphinx can be identified as the savage and leonine nature of Europa and Artemis, but an even tighter connection between the two sphinxes is provided by the riddle posed by the Greek one, 'What being has only one voice, has sometimes two feet sometimes three, sometimes four, and is weakest when it has the most?' Oedipus' answer referred to the life of man, but the fiddle belongs to a cluster - found all over the world - many of which refer to the weakness ofthe sun in the morning and evening and its strength at midday. I think that in the light ofthe Egyptian Sphinx's dedication to the sun in the morning and evening, the parallel is quite remarkable.
Despite the lateness of Apollo's name, the interplay of Egyptian and Semitic influences leads me to believe that this solar myth cycle was introduced during the Hyksos period. The Eleusinian Mysteries, on the other hand, which are the subject of Chapter VI, seem to have arrived rather later. The ancient chronographers, for their part, were generally agreed that the cult ofDemeter and Dionysos arrived in Attica in the second half of the 15th century. This would seem altogether plausible, despite the earlY-2nd-millennium origin of the name Demeter (see above, p. 57). The late 15th century was a period ofgreat Egyptian power after the conquests ofTuthmosis III, and one in which the mystery cults ofisis and Osiris seem to have been well established in Egypt and the Levant. Since Egyptian faIence plaques ofthe type placed under the corners of temples have been found at Mycenae dated to the reign of Amenophis III (14°5-1367), I have no difficulty in accepting the possibility that the Eleusinian cult of Archaic Greece was the descendant ofan Egyptian foundation made there 700 years earlier. For



BLACK ATHENA
one ofthe many ways in which this cult was unique in Greece was thatlike Egyptian temples - it had an established priesthood, in this case made up of two clans whose members in Hellenistic times certainly believed that they had Egyptian connections. The Egyptian Osiran mysteries featured Isis' search for her murdered husbandlbrother, her reassembly ofhis body, and the triumph of their son Horus over his father's murderer Seth. At first blush the Eleusinian story seems very different. In it Demeter searched for her daughter Persephone, stolen by Hades, god of the Underworld. She found Persephone but, failing to release her, she went on strike, preventing any natural seasonal growth. Finally a deal was made, according to which Persephone should spend half the year with Hades and half with her mother. These differences are not sufficient to override the ancient testimony that the Greek mysteries came from
Egypt. In Egypt, while Osiris was the focus of the cult, its chief protagonist was Isis; in Greece, there is little doubt that behind Demeter there lay Dionysos. Furthermore, in the Egyptian mysteries there were in fact not one, but two women. Isis had a constant companion in her sister/double Nephthys, who not only searched and mourned for Osiris but was also married to his murderer, Seth. In this way, she exacdy paralleled the ambiguity of Persephone with her loving and hellish aspects. Above all, however, the wide variations one finds within these Egyptian and Greek myth cycles themselves show that too much should not be made of the differences between them, given the large number of detailed parallels
found between the two mystery cults. There is also a survey of 20th-century studies ofthe subject, starting with the work of Paul Foucart, whose detailed research on Eleusis and considerable knowledge of Egyptology convinced him that the ancient tradition of Egyptian origin was irrefutable.25 In any event, there is no doubt that the centre of the Eleusinian Mysteries was the search for immortality, and the paradoxical beliefthat this could be achieved only through dying. It was believed that through the initiation of the Mysteries one could go through a symbolic death to be 'born again' as an immortal; this conception was current throughout the Ancient Near East but was overwhelmingly strong in Egypt. Thus the consensus of
INTRODUCTION 71
ancient writers was that Pythagoras, Orpheus, Sokrates, Plato and others concerned with the immortality of the soul had learnt about it
from Egypt. The concern with personal immortality was central to Orphism, an aspect of Greek religion that appears to have been introduced in the Archaic period, hundreds ofyears after the end ofthe Bronze Age with which Black Athena is otherwise concerned. Nevertheless, I believe its closeness to the Dionysian and Eleusinian cults justifies its presence in the third volume. The name Orpheus would seem to come from the Egyptian form CI)rp(t (Hereditary Prince), which was transcribed in Greek as Orpais. CI)rp(t was a tide given to the Egyptian god commonly known as Geb: the latter was a deity of the good earth - both the flora and fauna that covered it - and the Underworld. This fits both with Orpheus' place as a harmonizer ofnature and with his concern with the interior of the earth. Geb had a close relationship with Osiris, who was sometimes supposed to be his son and by whom he was largely replaced as lord of the Underworld. Orpheus and Dionysos seemed in many ways to duplicate each other similarly, but with some hostility between them. Egyptian society appears to have been rather intolerant of homosexuality, and it is hard to find any direct parallel to this aspect of Orpheus' character. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that, although eI)rp<t is not a feminine form, it was written with an egg as a determinative, which seems to be related to the cosmogenic egg laid byGeb in his form as a goose, often without female intervention. Here, too, there is a striking parallel with Greece, as a primal egg was also the beginning of the Orphic cosmogeny. Despite Geb's great antiquity, it is probable that the Orphic cult in Greece was a late introduction. There is, for instance, no mention of Orpheus or his cosmogony in Hesiod's Theogony, and the vocalization of CI)rp(t as Orpais/Orpheus would seem to be late. It seems likely, therefore - as many Ancients and Moderns have suspected - that although Orpheus may be very ancient, Orphism was established in the 6th century in close conjunction with Pythagoreanism; and that the association with Cl)rp<t was an attempt to give a new cult the kudos of antiquity. It is impossible to decide, however, whether the reform began in Greece or in Egypt. The Orphic and Pythagorean emphasis on



72 BLACK ATHENA
metampsychosis - the transmigration of souls - and the linked vegetarianism were also current among Egyptian priests in Hellenistic and Roman times. It is impossible to say how ancient these abstinences were, but given the general conservatism of Egyptian religion, they could well date back to the Old Kingdom. They could, on the other hand, have been promoted by later reforms. There are also connections between Orpheus and The Book of the Dead. In New Kingdom and later Egypt this served·as a guide for the soul through the perils of the Underworld to immortality, and was frequently buried with the mummified corpse. In Greece and Italy, spells and hymns inscribed on gold leaf were placed by the bodies of devotees ofOrpheus. So it is interesting to note in this connection that a version of The Book of the Dead does refer to 'the books of Geb and Osiris'. In Classical times it was generally believed the Orpheus was in some way Thracian, but that he had learnt his mysteries in Egypt. The close connections between Pythagoras and Egypt were acceptel by all in Antiquity. Thus the striking etymological and cultic similarities between Egyptian forms, and Orphic and Pythagorean ones, seem very easy to explain in terms of the Ancient Model. I should add, however, that it would be possible for an Aryanist to admit the Egyptian origin of such 'late' features without damaging his model as a whole. Nevertheless, I believe it is significant that so few do so.
The conclusion of Solving the Riddle of the Sphinx reiterates my general view that the etymologies and cultic parallels which make up the volume should be seen in context. The comparisons being made are not between Greek and, say, Algonquin or Tasmanian religions separated by vast distances of space and time. They are between two systems situated at the same end of the Mediterranean during the same millennia. Furthermore, the Classical and HeI1enistic Greeks themselves maintained that their religion came from Egypt, and Herodotos even specified that the names of the gods were - with one or two exceptions - all Egyptian. In the absence ofany plausible etymologies or cultic parallels from Indo-European culture, it would seem reasonable to look for Egyptian ones. The material in Volume 3, taken together with the sections on Athena and Hermes in Volume 2, shows that
INTRODUCTION 73
juxtaposing Greek with Egyptian and Canaanite religion makes comprehensible large tracts ofwhat had previously been complete mystery. More importantly, however, it raises many interesting new questions and generates hundreds of testable hypotheses. As I said at the beginning ofthe overall Introduction to this work, is precisely what differentiates fruitful radical innovation from sterile crankiness. The scholarly purpose ofSolving the Riddle ofthe Sphinx is the same as that of the other two volumes: to open up new areas ofresearch to women and men with far better qualifications than I have. The political purpose of BlackAthena is, of course, to lessen European cultural arrogance.

CHAPTER I
THE ANCIENT MODEL
IN ANTIQUITY
How it happened that Egyptians came to the Peloponnese, and what they did to make themselves kings in that part ofGreece, has heen chronicled by other writers; I will add nothing therefore, hut proceedto mention somepoints which, no one else has yet touched upon.
(Herodotos, Histories, VI.SS)l
T
HE MAJORITY OF US have been taught to regard Herodotos as the 'father ofhistory', but even those who follow Plutarch and regard him as the 'father of lies' can hardly maintain that Herodotos was lying about the existence ofsuch chronicles. His was not an unverifiable statement about some remote peoples, but one which readers could easily check, ifthey did not know about it already. Setting aside for a while the problem of what actually happened over a millennium before Herodotos wrpte his Histories, his statement strongly suggests that in the 5th century BC it was generally believed that Greece had been colonized from Egypt at the beginning of the Heroic Age. In this chapter I hope to demonstrate that Herodotos' views on the Egyptian and Phoenician settlements, though treated with condescension and scorn by most modem Classicists and ancient historians, were conventional not only in his own times but also throughout Archaic, Classical and later Antiquity.
PELASGIANS
Before exploring the views of Greeks in the Classical period on these and other hypothetical invasions, it would be useful to consider their



BLACK ATHENA
ideas about the earlier population of Greece. This is because it was the basis upon which they saw the Near Eastern influences as having acted. Here we encounter the thorny problem ofthe most widely known native population, the Pelasgoi or Pelasgians, a name used differently by different Greek authors. According to Homer, there were Pelasgians on both sides of the Trojan War. Some of Achilles' force of Hellenes
and Achaians were supposed to have inhabited 'PelasgianArgos', which was clearly seen as being in Thessaly.2 Fighting for Troy, on the other
hand, were the warriors of Hippothoos the Pelasgian, who came from Larisa.3 The probable derivation ofthe place name Laris(s)a is from the
Egyptian toponym R-ll}t, 'Entry into the Fertile Lands', which was
probably used for the Hyksos capital Avaris, in the rich soils of the Eastern Nile Delta.4 The semantic fit between Laris(s)a and R-ll) is
excellent. Further, the Homeric epithet for two different Larisai was mbolax (deep-soiled).5 As Strabo, the geographer of the 1st centuries
Be and AD, pointed out, all the many Greek Laris(s)ai were on alluvial
soil. 6 If we take the Hyksos colonizations as a working it is striking to note that the akropolis of the Peloponnesian Argos, the city
which Danaos was supposed to have founded and with which he had many cultic connections, was called Larisa.7 Furthermore Strabo
maintained, in another part of his Geography, that argos in Greek meant 'flat land,.8 This would fit nicely with the etymology of Larisa from
'Entry into the Fertile Lands' as the name of the Hyksos' capital. However, argos also signified 'speed' and 'dog' or 'wolf', both of which were reflected in the mythology and iconography of the Peloponnesian city.9 The core meaning of the word was 'brilliant' or 'silver'. This fits well with >Inb I)g, 'Silver Wall', the most frequently used name for
Memphis, the capital of Lower Egypt. 10 These three-way connections
between Pelasgian, Larisa and Argos are reinforced by the existence ofI' a Pelasgian Argos in the region of the two Larisai recorded in Thessaly.11
Homer referred to the great and ancient oracle ofZeus at Dodona in Epirus as 'Pelasgian', an epithet that was used for it by later writers. 12 Pelasgians appear elsewhere on his list of Cretan peoples which also included Achaians, Eteocretans, Kydonians and Dorians. 13 Hesiod
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 77
or possibly Kekrops of Miletos - stated that 'Three Hellenic tribes settled in Crete, the Pelasgoi, Achaians and Dorians.,14 Much later
Diodoros Sikeliotes claimed that Pelasgians had settled in Crete after the Eteocretans but before the Dorians.15 Even if the earlier quotation does not date back to Hesiod who, according to the Ancient Model, lived in the lOth century Be, it tallies well with the Homeric list. In the latter the Pelasgians are distinguished from the Eteo or 'true' Cretans, who are assumed to be non-Hellenic,
possibly Anatolian- but more probably Semitic-speaking. 16 Furthermore, Homer made no mention ofDanaans or Argives in Crete. These facts, together with the general connotation of 'native' associated with
the name, would make it plausible to suggest that the Pelasgians were the earliest Hellenic or Greek-speaking inhabitants ofthe island. Thus
'Hesiod's' order would appear to be chronological: the Pelasgians
having arrived on the island before the Achaian invasion of the 14th century, and that ofthe Dorians in the 12th. Thus they would seem on both lists to be equivalent to the Danaans.
A further indication that the Cretan Pelasgians were Hellenic comes from the link, made by several scholars, between the Pelasgians and the
Philistines who settled in Palestine in the 12th century Be. According to a substantial biblical tradition, the Philistines were supposed to have come from Crete. The equation *Pelasg and *Pelast has usually been explained by postulating an original 'Pre-Hellenic' final stop that was
heard as g by the Greeks and t by Egyptian and Semitic speakers. Apart from my suspicions about the existence of Pre-Hellenes, it is very hard
to construct a consonant somewhere between g and t. There is, however, another way by which one can associate the two.
In 1951 Jean Berard reinforced the links by drawing attention to the variant PelasgikoniPelastikon found in the great dictionary of Hesychios ofthe 5th century AD and in the scholium or commentary to the Iliad, Book XVI, verse 233. 17 This shows that it is possible to confuse the written forms of rand T. If, as I maintain elsewhere, the Greek alphabet has been in use since the 15th century Be, such an error might explain not only these textual variants but the name Pelasgoi itself. This could have come from *Pelast, the vocalization reconstructed for the Canaanite form. 18 (The development of the name



BLACK ATHENA
Hebrides from a misreading of the original Hebudes provides an analogy for this.)19 Although the nature of the Philistine language or languages is still very uncertain, the most likely candidates are West Anatolian languages like Lydian or Greek. The latter seems to me much more likely.20 Thus ifthere is an equation between Pelasgian and Philistine, which is possible, and ifthe Philistines spoke Greek, which is probable, it would increase still further the likelihood that the Cretan Pelasgians spoke a Hellenic language. Like Homer, Hesiod seems to have seen Pelasgians in Phthia in Thessaly.21 He also saw them in Arkadia, where the eponym Pelasgos was described as autochthonous.22 Akousilaos, in the 6th or 5th century Be, referred to all Greece south of Thessaly as 'Pelasgia'. Aischylos in the 5th enlarged it to include North Greece.23 Herodotos, meanwhile, wrote several interesting but very confusing passages about the Pelasgians. According to him, although they had lived throughout Greece, they were the ancestors only ofthe Ionians, not ofthe Dorians, who were 'Hellenes'. He maintained that the PelasgianJanguage was not Greek, basing this argument on the observation that in two cities on the Hellespont which were supposed to be Pelasgian, the language was foreign. Thus peoples like the Athenians, who were supposed to have been Pelasgian before becoming Hellenes, would have had to have changed their language.24 Apart from Athens, the places Herodotos associated with the Pelasgians were Dodona, the coast of the Peloponnese and Lemnos, Samothrace and the North-Eastern Aegean as a whole.25 Herodotos' contention would appear to be backed by the modem discovery in Lemnos ofa stele in a language resembling Etruscan, and there is every reason to suppose that the cities he referred to on the Hellespont also spoke Anatolian languages.26
In general, Herodotos' picture ofthe Pelasgians seems similar to that given by Thucydides a generation later. According to both, Pe(asgians formed the bulk, though not the whole, of the early population of Greece and the Aegean and most ofthem were gradually assimilated by the Hellenes.27 Herodotos saw this transformation as having taken place after the invasion by Danaos, which he envisioned around the middle of the 2nd millennium Be, and he described the Egyptian
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 79
Danaids as having taught the Pelasgians - not the Hellenes - the worship of the gods. Diodoros referred to Kadmos' having taught the Pelasgians the use of Phoenician letters.28 Furthermore, the tradition that Kekrops, the founder of Athens, was Egyptian was probably current in Herodotos' day. Thus despite the latter's claims that the Athenians - the Argives and Thebans - were autochthonous that is to say, aboriginal- one finds the interesting passage:
When what is now called Greece [Hellas] was occupied by the Pelasgians, the Athenians, a Pelasgian people, were called the Kranaoi. In the reign of Kekrops they acquired the name of Kekropidai. At the succession of Erechtheus they changed their name to Athenians.29
The idea that the Pelasgians were the native population, converted to become something more Greek by the invading Egyptians, occurs more clearly in the plays ofAischylos and Euripides, written around the time of Herodotos' Histories. According to them the Pelasgians were the indigenes, encountered and somehow overcome by Danaos in the Argolid:
Danaos, the father offifty daughters, on coming to Argos took up his abode in the city of Inachos and throughout Greece [Hellas] he laid down the law that all people hitherto named Pelasgians were to be
named Danaans.30
According to Aischylos the Pelasgians were clearly identified with the later Hellenes, and he refers anachronistically to the practices of the former as Hellenic.31
Strabo, in the I st centuries Be and AD, compiled many ofthe sources on the Pelasgians, adding a detailed story ofa Pelasgian migration from
Boiotia to Attica.32 Pausanias, in the 2nd century AD, referred to Pelasgians at Athens, Corinth, Argos, Lakonia and Messenia, though those in the last were supposed to have come from Thessaly.33 He stressed, however, the connection between them and the Arkadians. Pelasgos was considered to be the Arkadian ancestor, and Pausanias quoted the 6th-century poet Asios of Samos: 'And black earth produced the god-equalling Pelasgos.,34



80 BLACK ATHENA
Can any sense be made of these varied references? It was not only ancient writers like Herodotos and Strabo who had trouble reconciling them. The same difficulty has afflicted modem scholars. 'Their name was probably a national one: at least the Greek explanations of it are absurd', as the 19th-century polymath Niebuhr, the founder ofmodern ancient history, put it.35 A century later Eduard Meyer, who dominated ancient historiography at the tum of the 19th century, was equally despairing.36 Other 20th-century historians have tended to neglect the question and go no further than saying that the Pelasgians were a significant element in the early population of Greece.37
It is certainly difficult to accommodate them in the Aryan Model of Hellenic conquest from the north. Some writers, like the 19th-century pioneer ofthe Aryan Model, Ernst Curtius, saw them as a 'semi-Aryan' people conquered by a minority ofsuperior Aryan Hellenes.38 This fits quite nicely with Herodotos' reports of Pelasgians in the Anatolianspeaking North-Eastern Aegean. Such a hypothesis, however, makes it difficult to explain why, if the Pelasgians were so we!l remembered, there should have been no memory of their conquest by the Hellenes. Even Thucydides refers to the Pelasgians and others as having been 'Hellenized' by gradual 'intercourse' with the 'sons of Hellen', who themselves originated in Phthiotis near Thessaly.39
One way round this problem is the tack taken by William Ridgeway who dominated Classical archaeology at the turn of the 20th century and the 20th-century scholars Ernst Grumach and Sinclair Hood. They claim that the Hellenic conquest was recorded in tradition as the 'Return of the Heraklids' and 'Dorian Invasion', which were indeed tribal movements from north to south in the 12th century Be.40 Such a scheme jibes well with Herodotos' linking the Dorians to the Hellenes and the lonians to the Pelasgians.41 There is a slight problem in reconciling the reported Hellenization of the 'Pelasgian' Athenians with the strong tradition that Athens was never conquered f'Y the Dorians. But this difficulty pales into insignificance next to the 'fact', accepted by most I 9th- and nearly all 20th-century historians, that the Pre-Dorian makers of Mycenaean civilization were Greek-speaking. Thus the only way in which the 'Dorian Invasion' can be attached to the 'Aryan Conquest' is to say that it was the last of a series of
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 81
waves of migration. This, however, gets one no further forward in understanding the first arrival of Greek or 'Proto-Greek' speakers in
Greece. As can be seen from the references to Greek authors made above, the Ancient Model, too, faces difficulties over the Pelasgian question. For a modem proponent ofthe Revised Ancient Model, the best solution is to follow the mainstream of 19th-century historiography - scholars such as Grote and Wilamowitz-Moellendorf- and say that Pelasgian was a general name given to natives or aboriginals.42 I would claim, however, that it was predominantly applied to the indigenous Indo-Europeanspeaking peoples colonized and to some extent culturally assimilated by the Egypto-Phoenician invasions. This would fit well with the descriptions of Aischylos and Euripides given above. Thus Danaos' ordering the Pelasgians to become Danaan would represent their adoption of Near Eastern civilization. The idea ofassimilation would also tally with the process of the Athenians turning, possibly through the agency of Kekrops and Erechtheus, from Pelasgians to lonians. Thus, working in the Ancient Model one does not have the problem faced by scholars following the Aryan one in understanding how Classical writers saw the Pelasgians both as the original 'barbarian' inhabitants of Greece and as in some way Hellenic. It is also striking that in later times the Pelasgians tended to be associated with remote places like Arkadia, Epirus and the edge of Thessaly. In this case they could well be seen as partially unassimilated 'Proto-Greeks'. (An analogy for this would be the blurred distinction between the Vietnamese ofthe Red River Delta, and the Muong ofthe mountains to the south whose language and culture are like those of the Vietnamese but with far less of the latter's massive cultural borrowing from China. There is, however, no evidence to back such speculation.) We also know that Arkadians, at least by the end of the Mycenaean Age, were speaking Greek. Arkadia, moreover, seems to have been particularly full of Egyptian and Semitic influence.43 This could be explained by postulating a slow but complete assimilation there. Thus just as the Welsh, who had resisted Roman rule, preserved many Latin loan words and Roman Christianity, the Arkadians preserved traditions from the higher culture they had previously resisted. Against this, however, one



82 BLACK ATHENA
could also argue that they were called 'Pelasgian' simply because of their later traditionalism.
The Arkadians were not the only Greeks to preserve elements of Mycenaean culture into the Iron Age. The same can be said of the Ionians and the Aiolians. The great exception were the Dorians; this raises the problem of the nature of the Dorian culture or that of Northern and North-Western Greece, from which they are plausibly supposed to have come. There is little doubt about the presence of Egyptian and Semitic religious influences throughout Northern Greece and Thrace. There are also the specific links between the most important and probably the oldest oracular centre of the region, 'Pelasgian' Dodona, the Egypto-Libyan oracle of Ammon in the Siwa Oasis and the great oracle ofAmon at Thebes, which will be discussed inVolume 3. Furthermore, the Dorian leaders claimed to be 'Heraklids', that is descendants of the Danaan-Egyptian colonizers, replacing the later Tantalid or Pelopid dynasties which appear to have arrived from Anatolia in the 14th century. It is clear that Dorian kings continued to be proud oftheir Egypto-Hyksos ancestry well into Hellenistic times.44 Nevertheless, no Mycenaean palaces have been found in North-West Greece, and it would seem plausible to suppose that in general the region was much less affected by Near Eastern influences than the rest of Greece. In addition the Dorian 'Return of the Heraklids', while claiming Danaan legitimacy, may also have had revolutionary social and national aspects. Several archaeologists have noted a revival of PreMycenaean, Middle Helladic material culture after the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces. Thus it may well by that the Mycenaean Age was ended by invasions of unassimilated Dorians combined - in some areas at least - with support from only partially assimilated peasants living within the palatial economy.45
All in all, the references to Pelasgians on Mainland Greece fit the Ancient Model reasonably well. According to it, 'Pelasgian' was,imply a name given to unassimilated native Greeks. Such a framework would not be incompatible with the early but Hellenic Pelasgians in Crete.46 The great difficulty for the Revised Ancient Model, on the other hand, comes from Herodotos' explicit statement that he believed the Pelasgians to have been non-Greek-speaking. He seems to have based
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY
this claim entirely on evidence from the North-East Aegean, and it would seem plausible to suggest that in this case 'Pelasgian' was being used in its broad sense of'native,. It appears to have been the attempt to unify these disparate peoples that has caused such confusion to ancient and modern writers.
IONIANS
The Ionians were one ofthe two great tribes of Greece, the other being the Dorians. In Classical times the Ionians lived in a band across the central Aegean from Attica to 'Ionia' on the Anatolian shore. They had strong traditions, both ofhaving colonized to the East after the arrival of the Dorians, and of having lived more widely in Greece before the invasions. Herodotos, almost certainly following an older tradition, linked the Pelasgians to the Ionians:47
The Ionians ... according to the Greek account, as long as they lived in what is now known as Achaia in the Peloponnese, before the coming of Danaos and Xouthos, were called Pelasgians of the coast ... The Islanders too . . . are a Pelasgian people: they were later known as the Ionians for the same reason as those who inhabited the twelve cities founded from Athens.48
The Ionians of Attica and Ionia on the Anatolian coast placed great stress on their ancient native origins. No one denies that I(a)on, found in Linear B as ia-wo-ne, is the same as the West Semitic Yawan, the Assyrian Yawani or Yamani, the Persian Yauna and the Egyptian Demotic Wynn. All mean 'Greek'. All authorities, however, assume the name Ion to be Greek, despite the fact that it lacks an Indo-European etymology.49 The most plausible origin for the cluster and for the names of the native Aones and Hyantes encountered by the legendary Egypto-Phoenician invaders of Boiotia would seem to be the Egyptian >Irvn(ty(rv)) (bowmen, barbarians).5o Not only is this word attested well over a thousand years before the others, but it has an obvious etymology .from irvnt (bow) and irvn (pillar or tree trunk). The fact that Egyptian texts tend to apply it to other African peoples and do not use it for Greeks, for whom they had other names, does not



BLACK ATHENA
seriously weaken the derivation. The indiscriminate use of the English name 'Indian', applied to completely different peoples, shows how easily terms for 'natives' or 'barbarians' can shift. In this case we know that West Semitic speakers were using a strikingly similar term specifically for Greeks at least by the tum of the I st millennium Be. As has been mentioned in the Introduction, the Egyptian deity of the desert and all the wildness beyond the Nile valley and its inhabitants was St, transcribed as Seth in Greek and Sutekh in Akkadian. It will be argued in Volume 3 that Seth was the equivalent ofPoseidon, and it is striking therefore to note that according to conventional wisdom in 5th-century Greece, the father of Ion - the legendary eponym after whom the people were named - was a troublemaker called Xouthos, a name that could phonetically well derive from St. The semantic connection between the two is strengthened by the fact that Poseidon was the
patron of the Ionians.51 In this way the Revised Ancient Model can provide plausible etymologies for the names Xouthos and Ion, and explanations for the close relations perceived by ancient writers between--the Pelasgians and Ionians. Generally it can begin to make some sense of data that have remained a hopeless jumble to the many brilliant scholars who have attempted to understand them in terms ofthe Aryan Model.
COLONIZATION
When dealing with the Greek· traditions of colonization, I think it is useful to put them in three categories. First, there are the vague, not to say incoherent, traditions concerning such legendary figures as King Inachos in Argos and Amphion and Zethos at Thebes. Secondly, there are those concerning Kekrops in Attica or Rhadamanthys in Crete and Ionia which were the subject ofdebate in Antiquity. Thirdly, there were the reports of Kadmos, Danaos and Pelops, which were generally accepted. As mentioned above, I believe that for reasons of cultural pride Greeks tended to play down the extent of Near Eastern influence and colonization. Furthermore, I am certain that all the legends contain interesting kernels ofhistorical truth, and that the hierarchy!'f obscurity can be explained in terms of age: the more recent the colonization,
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 85
the clearer the picture ofit. This volume will be largely concerned with the traditions of Danaos and Kadmos, as it was the more recent colonizations that were the battleground during the fall of the Ancient Model and the triumph ofthe Aryan one. First, we should consider Kadmos' colonization ofThebes. This was the stronghold of the Ancient Model because it was so vigorously and widely attested, and because respect for the Semitic Phoenicians outlasted that for the African Egyptians by several decades. Englishspeaking Classical scholarship on Kadmos has been dominated by an article published in 19I 3 by A. W. Gomme. This author claimed that the Kadmeian and, by implication, the other colonizations had been invented by 'rationalist' historians in the early 5th century, just before Herodotos.52 Such an extreme position was always difficult to defend, however, and it is now untenable. First of all, there is the intrinsic implausibility ofsuch detailed, varied and unpatriotic legends springing up so suddenly and widely in the intensely nationalistic 5th century. Secondly, there is the pictorial evidence: a 7th-century relief vase fragment depicts Europa in Oriental costume, and there are similar
early representations of her and the Danaids.53 The central argument, however, comes from literature. While Homer did not mention the colonizations, there is no reason why he should have done. While his epics almost certainly contained earlier materials, they were concerned with the end ofthe Mycenaean Age, not its beginnings several hundred years earlier. The Iliad is full of references to Danaans and Kadmeians, whose eponyms - Danaos and Kadmos - would have been instantly recognized by at least later Greeks as having come from Egypt or Phoenicia. Homer and Hesiod both referred to Europa, who was always seen as a sister or some other close relative to Kadmos, as the 'daughter ofPhoinix'. Reluctant to admit that this could have any connection with Phoenicia, Karl Otfried Muller and other source critics have pointed out, correctly, that phoinix has many other meanings and need not be directly connected with the Levant.54 However, given Homer's frequent use of Phoinix in the sense of 'Phoenician', and the later universal identification of Europa and Kadmos with Phoenicia, this argument seems rather far-fetched, especially when we know that Hesiod described Phoinix as the father of



86 BLACK ATHENA
Adonis, whose Phoenician parentage is as beyond doubt as the origin of his name from the Canaanite )c1don (lord}.55 Indeed, since Gomrne wrote his article, a fragment of Hesiod's Catalogue of Women has been published in which Europa is described as the daughter of the 'noble Phoenician' and her abductor, Zeus, carries her over the 'salt water'.56 This confirms that the Europa story, which the scholiast on Iliad XII.292 attributed to both Hesiod and the 5th-century poet Bakchylides, existed in the time ofthe former. For Danaos there is Hesiod's testimony that Danaos and his daughters dug wells for the city of Argos and the strong implication of his relationship with Aigyptos. There is also a fragment from a lost epic, the Danais, which describes the daughters ofDanaos anning themselves by the banks ofthe Nile.57 Thus even ifone wants to doubt the antiquity of the sources of Aischylos, Euripides and Herodotos, other evidence makes it overwhelmingly likely that the traditions of Danaos and Kadmos go back to epic times. In order to know what we are talking about, it would seem useful at this point to consider the different assessments of the dates of the greatest epic writer, Homer, and of his approiimate contemporary, Hesiod. The Ancients tended to put Hesiod before Homer and to place them both between 1100 and 850 BC, in any event definitely before the first Olympic Games in 776.58 Scholars today tend to reverse the order. They place Homer between 800 and 700 BC and Hesiod sometime around the latter. The fundamental basis for this down-dating has been that since the 1930S conventional wisdom has held that the alphabet was introduced only in the 8th century. As the contemporary scholar George Forrest has written:
Hesiod, like Homer, lived in a period of transition from oral to written composition. Indeed it seems likely that each was the first, or among the first, to commit to manuscript his own version of a long oral tradition.59
However, even Classicists now tend to date the introduction of the Phoenician alphabet into Greece to the 9th or late lOth century BC. Some Semitists have put that of the Canaanite alphabet in the 11th, while I argue that the transmission must have taken place b9"ore 1400
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY
BC.60 Thus the alphabetic basis for challenging the ancient chronology would seem unsound. Further reasons for the lowering of Homer's dates are that in the Iliad the most refined goods come from Phoenicia, and the Odyssey refers to Phoenicians in the Aegean. Hence, as the latter were supposed to have arrived at the earliest in the 9th century, Homer - if there had been such an individual - could not have lived before then.61 This argument, however, was developed before recent archaeological discoveries indicating that Phoenicians were present in the Aegean from the lOth, if not the late 11th century. This new evidence tallies well with the powerful historical case for the the peak of Phoenician expansion having been between 1000 and 850 BC.62 Another reason given for placing Homer in the late 8th or 7th century is that the Odyssey is largely set to the west of Greece, and it is argued that the Greeks could not have known about the central Mediterranean before their colonization of Sicily and Southern Italy at the end of the 8th century.63 I think that it is in many ways useful to look at this epic as a Greek version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and that in both Egyptian and Greek cosmology the western islands of the sunset were associated with the Underworld and astral realms of the dead.64 Even without this hypothesis, however, it is clear that there was considerable Mycenaean trade to the west in the Bronze Age and that evenif Greeks were not directly involved, they must have been aware ofthe Phoenician dealings with the West Mediterranean in the I I th, lOth and 9th
centuries. The reasons given for putting Hesiod after Homer are first, that it is
supposed that Hesiod
does not belong with the heroic poets ... he is always personal and contemporary in his outlook ... Hesiod is wholly part ofthe Iron Age ofthe present, specifically ofthe Archaic Greek world ofthe 8th and
early 7th centuries BC.65
It is also argued that as Hesiod's Theogony was clearly based on Near Eastern models of a type that was developed only after I 100, these can have been introduced into Greece only after 800 BC, when it is alleged that a Greek colony was established at AI Mina on the Syrian coast.66 Hesiod's Theogony belongs to a general type which can be traced



88 BLACK ATHENA
throughout the Middle East from the 3rd millennium, and there is little reason to doubt that some form or forms of it existed in Mycenaean Greece.67 Nevertheless Hesiod's version does seem to contain peculiarities that can best be explained in terms of the traditions of the turn of the I st millennium.68 On the other hand, the existence of the Greek colony at Al Mina is in serious doubt, and it would seem plausible that Hesiod and his contemporaries were in touch with these later theogonies through Phoenicia from where, after all, Hesiod seems to have got his favourite wine.69
All in all, the grounds for challenging the ancient traditions for the dating of Homer and Hesiod seem very weak. It would appear reasonable to accept as a working hypothesis the Classical and Hellenistic consensus that Hesiod predated Homer, that the former flourished in the lOth century and the latter around the turn of the 9th. Whatever dates they are assigned to, however, there seems no reason to doubt that traces of the legends of colonization from Egypt and Phoenicia appear in the oldest surviving Greek traditions.
/' THE COLONIZATIONS IN
GREEK TRAGEDY
Although there are references to Egyptian and Phoenician settlers in other plays of the period, I shall focus here on the drama in which settlement on the Greek Mainland is a central theme: Aischylos' The Suppliants. The Suppliants is generally considered to be the first play and sole survivor ofa trilogy or tetralogy. The titles ofthe missing pieces are believed to have been The Egyptians, The Danaids, and a satirical play, Amymone, and from The Suppliants and later writings on myth and legend, the overall theme ofthe dramas is clear.
10, the daughter ofKing Inachos ofArgos, was loved by Zeus. Hera, in one ofher many fits of jealousy, turned 10 into a cow and tormented her with gadflies. 10 fled to many places and finally settled in Egypt, where she gave birth to Zeus' child, Epaphos. Epaphos' descendants and their spouses included Libya, Poseidon, Belos, King Agenor of Tyre - the father of Kadmos and Europa - and the twin brothers
Danaos and Aigyptos.7o Danaos had fifty daughters and Aigyptos fifty
,/
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY
sons. The brothers quarrelled but later there was a mass wedding on the night ofwhich, with one exception, Danaos' daughters killed Aigyptos' sons. In some way Danaos then acquired the throne of Argos. The various versions of the story differ greatly, particularly over which of these actions took place in Egypt and which in Argos. The Suppliants describes one episode ofthis story, the arrival in Argos of Danaos' daughters as suppliants fleeing from Egypt and the evil intentions ofthe sons ofAigyptos. There they are given the sanctuary of Zeus Hikesios 'the Suppliant' by the native king, Pelasgos. A herald arrives from Aigyptos and his sons and arrogantly commands that Danaos' daughters be handed back. Pelasgos, with stout Hellenic patriotism, refuses and the play ends with plans for the settlement of Danaos and his daughters with Pe1asgos and his people in Argos. The extent to which modern study of this play and trilogy has been suffused with politics is not generally realized. German RomanticPositivists and later scholars have insisted that this is the earliest extant play by Aischylos - or, for that matter, by anyone. This dating has in fact been set up as a touchstone of modern Classical scholarship:
Scholars have hitherto regarded the Supplices [Suppliants] as the earliest extant play of Aischylos; if we now consent to put it late it makes all attempts to study literature futile. 71 .
However, a papyrus published in 1952 now indicates strongly that the trilogy won a prize in 464-3 Be and that it is therefore the product ofthe tragedian's maturity.n This fits well with the high esteem in which the play was held in 5th- and 4th-century Athens. A contemporary Classicist, Dr Alan Garvie, has devastatingly shown the hollowness of the claims made for its early date on grounds of metre, vocabulary and dramatic structure.73 What then caused the consistent disparagement of its 'immaturity'? The most plausible reason is that it was considered unworthy of the greatest Greek tragedian in his prime to treat a topic that could be understood to suggest that Egyptians had settled in the Peloponnese. There have been equally persistent attempts to diminish the Egyptian aspects ofthe play, which in later times became so important a prop for the Ancient Model. For instance, while 10 is seen as coming



BLACK ATHENA
from Argos, most sources agree that she was only the distant ancestor of Aigyptos and Danaos. Thus the brothers and their children were Egyptianized, if not purely Egyptian, and the Danaids are explicidy described as 'black,.74 The mainstream of German scholarship, however, has preferred the one scholiast who can dubiously be construed to say that the twins were the children of 10 herself. The same scholiast also maintains that the whole action of the trilogy took place in Argos. This version has been preferred to all the other sources, some ofwhich held that all the events were situated in Egypt, and all of which including the lines from the Danais mentioned above - had the Danaids
arriving from Egypt.75
Despite these criticisms of Aryanist scholars, there is no doubt that Aischylos was full of what can usefully be called Hellenic nationalism and wanted to lessen the impact of any invasion. He had lived through the height ofthe Persian Wars. As an Athenian aristocrat he took part in the critical Batde ofMarathon in 492 BC which checked a major Persian invasion. His play The Persians direcdy expressed the xenophobic passions of his generation. In The Suppliants they are only thinly disguised:
Sirrah! What dost thou? What manner ofarrogance has incited thee thus to do dishonour to this realm of Pelasgian men? Think'st thou forsooth, 'tis to a realm of women that thou art come? For a barbarian that has to do with Hellenes, thou waxest over-proud.76
In such a passionately chauvinist atmosphere, it would seem more plausible to suppose that Aischylos wanted to diminish rather than exaggerate the Egyptian components in the myth cycle. There is considerable evidence from the text to support this contention, but to demonstrate it I shall have to go ahead of my argument and use approaches generally reserved for the second and third volumes of this work.
The elements ofany legend can be roughly graded for their historical value. The least useful are motifs common to folk tales everywhere, in this case such elements as the story of the fifty daughters marrying and murdering fifty sons. Other folkloric themes occur elsewhere, but in significant places. The Egyptian informants ofDiodoros Sikeliotes told /'
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 9 1
him that Greeks had transferred the site of lo's origin from Egypt to Argos.77 Michael Astour has shown how the story ofIo, Zeus and Hera resembles the Semitic one ofHagar in the Bible. The last, whose name seems to derive from the Semitic Yhgr (wander), was loved and impregnated by Abraham and driven by his jealous wife Sarah into the desert. She almost died, but God provided her with rest at an oasis where she gave birth to Ishmael, who was half man, half beast. Astour also cites a striking passage fromJeremiah, 'A beautiful heifer is Egypt, but a gadfly from the north has come upon her', to suggest that the prophet's Israelite audience knew the legend. Astour uses both these to claim that Semitic influence is present in the legends surrounding Danaos'setdement.78 However, there seem to be even more indications of the presence of Egyptian mythology. For example, in the Suppliants (line 212) Danaos invokes 'the bird of Zeus' and the chorus responds by invoking 'the saving beams of the sun'. Commentators have been obliged to see the striking parallel with the solar hawk of Zeus' Egyptian equivalent Amon-Ra, but they try to diminish its significance by calling it 'Egyptianizing', which gives it the flavour of being somehow late and superficial.79 Elsewhere, there are references to a 'nether' or 'underground' Zeus who welcomes the dead, and to 'another Zeus' who holds judgement in the Underworld upon men's misdeeds. These look remarkably like the Egyptian trial of the dead by Osiris, and it is not surprising that the latter has been paralleled with passages in the Odyssey which are widely accepted as being 'Orphic' and ultimately Egyptian.8o These references are suggestive. The 'hardest' historical evidence to be found in legends, however, comes from proper names, and here it is necessary to draw on the recent work ofthe Classicist and literary critic Frederic Ahl. Ahl has shown the great sophistication of the Classical writers and the need to approach their texts as one would, say, Finnegans Wake. His view is that one should avoid imposing - as many Classicists have - a 'monist' or single crude meaning to them. In practice, he argues, one should look for the dense network of puns, anagrams and structural parallels which give the texts muitiple and often contradictory meanings or 'readings'. Furthermore, the puns should not be treated



BLACK ATHENA
lightly but should be considered as revealing deep, if not sacred, connections and truths.81 There is no doubt that The Suppliants rewards such treattnent. Garvie refers to
the use of words whose sound or form suggests one of the motifs, though its own meaning may be quite different. At Supplices 117 means 'hilly land', but suggests 'land of the cow', [The stem bou- means 'cattle'] while 'AJtLuv recalls Apis, the Egyptian equivalent ofofEpaphus (cf. 262). This is much more than a play on words. It springs from the idea that a name is not merely a matter of convention, but intimately belongs to the thing it represents.82
Garvie then goes on to point out specific parallels between the name Epaphos and the stem ephap-, which frequently appears in the play and which itself has the two meanings, 'seize' and 'caress'. There is also epipnoia, which means both the gentle breathing of Zeus that impregnates 10 and later the storm that threatens the Danaids.83 Even beyond these and Apia(n), another connection to the name Epaphos has been suggested by Jean Berard: the name >Ip.py was that of two or three __ Hyksos pharaohs and was conventionally rendered in Greek as Ap(h)ophis.84 As Astour points out, the difference in can be explained by the fact that Late Egyptian went through a vowel shift (J>fJ towards the end of the 2nd millennium.85 This would suggest that the name Epaphos was introduced before that time and weaken the argument for late 'Egyptianizing'. The place name Apia, which is rarely used outside this play, generally means Argos, but it is used elsewhere to cover the whole of the Peloponnese. It has plausibly been linked with apios (distant) or apiegaie (distant land) in Homer.86 However, this is unlikely to be its origin, and Apia has many other associations. It was obvious to the Ancients - and since 1911 even modem scholarship has recognized - that the name recalls the Apis bull ofEgypt and is therefore associated with the cow 10 and her Egyptian son Epaphos.87 The Apis bull-cult in Memphis dated back to the I st Dynasty but its peak of influence was after the 18th, and the original Egyptian form of the name is I:!pw.88 I:!p or I:!py was the name of one of Horns' sons, prominent in The Book ofthe Dead,
[CH.IJ THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 93
whose special responsibility was guarding the north.89 Thus he would, in Egyptian eyes, be associated with Greece. At first sight it might seem too far-fetched to connect him with the Greek Apia; however, in The
Suppliants there is the passage:
The ground whereon we stand is Apian land itself, and hath of old .borne that name in honour of a leech [doctor]. For Apis, seer and leech, the son of Apollo, came from Naupaktos on the farther shore and purged well this land of monsters deadly to man, which Earth, defiled by the bloody deeds of yore, caused to spring up - plagues charged with wrath, a baleful colony of swarming serpents. Ofthese plagues Apis worked a cure by surgery and spells to the content ofthe Argive land ...90
It should be pointed out that, in the Egyptian pantheon, I:!py was the guardian of the Canopic jar containing the small intestine, and in The Book ofthe Dead one ofhis major functions in protecting the dead was to kill demons in the shape of serpents.91 Apollo was generally equated with I:!py's father, Horus. The intricacy of this parallel makes it overwhelmingly plausible. However, unlike the apparently ancient origin of the name Epaphos, that of Apis - at least in this context seems to have been more recent. The name Apia does not occur in Homer and the story of its eponym told above appears only in this passage and does not seem to have belonged to a more general tradition. Epaphos and Apia are not alone. Most ofthe names in The Suppliants have strong Egyptian connotations, of which I shall give only a few examples. Inachos, now generally considered to be the most Argive name in the play, is seen as the king of Argos and father of10. He later became Argos' major river, and as such was often contrasted with the Egyptian Nile. In the 18th century, however, the attitude was very different. The bold and brilliant scholar Nicolas Fn!ret, for example,
maintained - rather dubiously - on the basis of the Christian Church E . I · 92 F' t
Father Eusebius, that Inachos was an gypoan co omzer. rere argued that the name was a common one in the Middle East, meaning 'men famous for their strength and bravery', and he cited the biblical term <iindq, transcribed Enak or Enach in the Greek of the Septuagint,
and the Greek anox, anaktos (king).



94 BLACK ATHENA
The name <amlq is ambiguous. It was used for the rulers of Qiryat )Arba<, who seem to have been Hittites, but it generally referred to the tall and powerful Philistines, who are widely accepted as having come from the Aegean.93 As the word (w)anakt- appears in Phrygian as well as in Greek, (iindq could have been derived from it. Apart from the
dubiousness of this etymology, there is the problem of the clear indication that >Arba< was founded in the 17th or 18th century BC.94 But if, as I believe, the Philistines were predominantly Greekspeaking, the former may well be a loan from the latter.9S
In any event, Freret was unaware of the Egyptian rootV<nv, which very much strengthens his general case. Its basic meaning was 'life', as in the famous symbol ofthe ankh, but it had a wide range ofextensions. The formula (nb 4.t (may he live for ever) was the standard formula used after the names ofliving pharaohs, and this makes a plausible etymology for the Greek (w)anax, (w)anaktos (king), which has no known origin in
Indo-European.96 Another use of(nb is as 'coffin', which would seem to be the etymology for the Greek Anaktoron, the sacred reliquary at the centre ofthe Eleusinian Mysteries.
More relevant to our present concern is the use of (nb in the phrase mw(nb to describe 'living' water. Anaktos is used in the same way and specifically in the line from the lost epic the Danais-, NELAOLO 'i\vax"Co£, 'of the royal/living river Nile'. The Nile was renowned for its fertility and life-giving powers. Furthermore, according to the mythographer Apollodoros, who probably lived in the 1st century AD, the mother of Aigyptos and Danaos, who was the daughter of the Nile, was called Anchinoe. The possibility that this derives from an Egyptian form fI:(nb nwy (living waters or life ofwater) is increased by the variants of her name as Anchirrhoe or Anchirhoe: rhoi means 'stream or flow' in Greek.97
The existence of such peculiar semantic clusters - in both Egyptian and Greek - around royalty, coffins and flowing water would seem to lessen the chances of random coincidence very nearly to zero. Also, the triple service of Inachos as king, progenitor and river and the frequent contrasts given between him and the Nile would suggest intricate paranomasia, or punning, in Egyptian and Greek of the type suggested above with I:Ipw/y - Apis/Apia. Here, too, despite the use of
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 95
"Avax"Co£ in the epic, the facts that neither Homer nor Hesiod uses the name Inachos and that the latter uses another name for lo's father suggests that this Egypto-Greek relation is indeed a later elaboration. The name of Inachos' daughter 10 has been derived from the verb ienai (to wander), which would neatly correspond to the etymology of Hagar from v'hgr (wander).98 There are, however, equally clear Egyptian and Semitic etymologies. Modern commentators admit the dear punning going on in the play between" Iw '10' 'lwv 'Ionian' and "Iov 'violet'.99 The Egyptian origin of Ionian has been suggested above. The double etymology of 10 itself would seem to be firstly from the Egyptian (moon), which in the Bohairic dialect of Coptic is rendered ;0f!.100 Furthermore, there were traditions that io was a dialect
word for 'moon' in Argos. Linked to this - as Ahl points out - are the associations between 10 and Isis who, in very late Egyptian religion, was associated with the moon. Ahl further indicates the lunar connections, with the horns and femininity coalesced in the 'cow,.101 It is here that
we find the second and, I believe, basic Egyptian etymologies for 10:
those from (cow) - plural - and lWJ (domestic long-horned cattle).
Among the names of lo's descendants we have considered that of Epaphos. Libya - from the Late Egyptian Rb - is, I believe, a form of Athena. 102 Many scholars have derived the name of their son Belos from the Semitic v'b<l, either in the general sense of'lord' or specifically as the god of that name. 103 The name Phoinix is clearly associated with Phoenicia. 104 Paradoxically, Agenor King ofTyre is the only member of the family to have a Greek name meaning 'manly' or 'bold'. The etymology of the name Aigyptos is obvious. Originally I:I(t)-K3-Ptl:t,
'Temple ofthe Spirit ofPtah', was a name ofthe Lower Egyptian capital ofMemphis. By the Late Bronze Age, however, it seems to have been in common use for 'Egyptian' throughout the East Mediterranean, and the personal name Ai-ku-pi-ti-jo is mentioned in Mycenaean
Greece. IOS The name of Aigyptos' twin and rival Danaos appears as Da-na-jo in Linear B, but this presents a much more complicated and fascinating problem. No known figure in Egyptian history or mythology has this name. It does, however, have a long association with the Aegean,



BLACK ATHENA
possibly stretching back into the 3rd millenium.106 Da-na-ne is attested in Linear A; T)iruy or ta-na-yu appears as an Egyptian name for Greece from the 15th century, and D3-m was in use by the 13th.101 Astour has linked the stem to the Semitic root Vdn(n) Oudge), seen in such names as Dan>el or Daniel, and he maintains that the Danaans, whose eponym was Danaos, were a Semitic-speaking tribe he sees as having arrived in Greece in the Late Bronze Age, probably from Cilicia in South-Eastern Anatolia. 108 While I accept that there probably were connections between the various peoples called Danila or T ani!a in the East Mediterranean, and I believe that both Cilicia and the Southern
Aegean were heavily Semitized during most ofthe Bronze Age, I prefer to follow those scholars who maintain that the Dnnym found later in Cilicia and the biblical tribe ofDan came from the Aegean, rather than the other way around. 109 However, the colonizations with which we are concerned came considerably earlier, and all the legends about these insist that Danaos was an incomer to Greece.
The name Dan- is certainly surrounded by dense and old punning in Egyptian, West Semitic and Greek. Gardiner points out that by the I I th century Be the place name D3-m or Dene was written with determinative or pictogram of a bent old man. He associates this with the Egyptian [nt, later written - by this period, d, 1, and t were all pronounced in the same way - meaning 'old' and 'tired'.He therefore calls it the 'tired land,.110 It is interesting to note, therefore, that Danaos' most striking characteristics in The Suppliants and elsewhere are his great age and weariness. He was also known as a wise judge and legislator who settled the Argolid, and he and his daughters were especially renowned for their involvement in irrigation. Thus his name could well come from an Egyptian form *dnhv (allocator or irrigator), from (allocate, irrigate), which is clearly related to the Semitic Vdn(n) OUdge). It seems to me that the network of punning here is too dense to make it possible to distinguish which came first: the Danaan people of the Aegean or Danaos, the Egypto-Semitic colonial distributor oflands, legislator and irrigator.
If.the conclusions to be drawn from Danaos' name are inevitably ambIguous, the legends about his struggle with Aigyptos have been seen, at least since the 3rd century Be, to point unequivocally to his
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 97
having been a Hyksos chieftain driven out by the Egyptian national revival of the 18th Dynasty. III In this connection, we should tum to the Greek name of The Suppliants, Hiketides. This is clearly linked to Hikesios (the Suppliant), the central byname of Zeus, the god who dominates the play from beginning to end.112 The rather strange byname or epiclesis Hikesios was occasionally used elsewhere, particularly in Southern Greece, and belongs to a general aspect of the god whereby he protected strangers. 113 It is also interesting to note that the two plays called Hiketides both refer to Argos, the city later especially associated with the Hyksos colonization.1l4 Hikesios strikingly resembles the Egyptian l:ll9 wst, which in the 3rd century Be was rendered into Greek as Hyksos. Given the general and pervasive paranomasia or punning in the play shown above, it would seem very likely indeed that Aischylos and his sources were aware of the double entendre in a play set in a trilogy about the struggle between Aigyptos and Danaos, and specifically about the arrival of the latter in Argos from Egypt. It would also seem reasonable to suppose that 'Hyksos' was the primary meaning and that the idea of 'suppliant' derived from it. The widespread attestation of Zeus Hikesios, however, would suggest that the pun was an old one, and it is very unlikely that it originated with Aischylos. There is also little doubt that the portrayal of the arrival as one of refugees who were hospitably received by the natives and who then mysteriously became rulers was much more satisfying to Hellenic nationalism than one of a conquest. It would certainly have helped relieve the tension between ancient tradition and national pride. The question ofwhether or not there actually was a Hyksos colonization of Argos in the 2nd millennium Be will be discussed in Volume 2. All I argue here is that the theme of The Suppliants, and the massive amount of Egyptian material in it, demonstrate that Aischylos and his sources, which go back at least to the writing ofthe Danais in the 7th century or earlier, believed this to have been the case. Lastly, I should add that The Suppliants is not the only tragedy to refer to the colonizations: many of those treating Thebes mention Kadmos' Phoenician origin. In Euripides' The Phoenician Women, for instance, the chorus of Phoenician women come - precisely because Kadmos



BLACK ATHENA
came from Tyre - to see the downfall of his dynasty. 115 There too the evidence points in favour of a general belief in the legends in the 5th
century BC. 1l6
HERODOTOS
The most striking manifestation of this belief comes from Herodotos, who wrote his great Histories in about 450 BC. His major theme was the relationship between Europe - by which he generally meant Greece and Asia and Africa. He saw this relationship as one of similarities and differences, contacts and conflicts, and he asked many questions on these topics during his wide travels in the Persian Empire from Babylonia to Egypt, and on its northern and western fringes from Epirus and Greece to the Black Sea.
The quotation at the head of this chapter shows that Herodotos did not write any descriptions ofthe colonizations, because he believed that this had been done elsewhere. Equally, however, the passage makes it clear that he firmly believed they had actually taken place. The Histories are full of references to them:
The temple ofAthena there [Lindos in Rhodes] was founded by the daughters of Danaos, who touched at the island during their flight from the sons of Aigyptos.1l7
Kadmos, the son ofAgenor, touched at it [Thera] during his search for Europa and ... left there a number of Phoenicians. 118 --
Herodotos was not so much interested in the settlements themselves, but in how they had been instrumental in introducing Egyptian and Phoenician civilization to Greece:
I propose to hold my tongue about the mysterious rites of Demeter, which the Greeks call Thesmophoria, though ... I may say, for instance, that it was the daughters of Danaos who brought this
ceremony from Egypt and instructed the Pelasgian women in it ...1l9
The Phoenicians who came with Kadmos ... introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 99
accomplishments, of which the most important was writing, an art till then, I think, unknown to the Greeks. 120
Elsewhere he related the introduction of Near Eastern civilization to cultural figures dependent on political and military ones. The process had continued, however, after the initial colonization:
Now I have an idea that Melampous ... introduced the name of Dionysos into Greece, together with the sacrifice in his honour·and the phallic procession. He did not, however, fully comprehend the doctrine, or communicate it in its entirety; its more perfect developmentwas the work oflater teachers. Nevertheless it was Melampous who introduced the phallic procession, and from Melampous that the Greeks learnt the rites that they now perform. Melampous, in my view, was an able man who acquired the art ofdivination and brought into Greece, with little change, a number of things which he had learned in Egypt, and amongst them the worship of Dionysos ... Probably Melampous got his knowledge about Dionysos through Kadmos ofTyre and the people who came with him from Phoenicia to the country now called Boiotia. The names ofnearly all the gods came to Greecefrom Egypt. [my emphasis] I know from the enquiries I have made that they came from abroad, and it seems most likely that it was from Egypt, for the names of all the gods have been known in Egypt from the beginning of time ... These practices, then, and others which I shall speak oflater, were borrowed by the Greeks from Egypt ... In ancient times, as I know from what I was told at Dodona, the Pelasgians offered sacrifices ofall kinds, and prayed to the gods, but without any distinction ofname or title - for they had not yet heard of any such thing. They called the gods by the Greek word theoi 'disposers' ... Long afterwards the names ofthe gods were brought into Greece from Egypt and the Pelasgians learnt them ... then as time went on, they sent to the oracle at Dodona (the most ancient, and at that period, the only oracle in Greece) to ask advice about the propriety of adopting names that had come into the country from abroad. The oracle replied that they would be right to use them. From that time onward, therefore, the Pelasgians used the names of



100 BLACK ATHENA
the gods in their sacrifices, and from the Pelasgians the names
passed to Greece.121
Moreover, Herodotos did not restrict the introduction of Near Eastern ideas to the colonists. His description of the Egyptian and Libyan origins of the oracle at Dodona in Epirus, based on the reports of priestesses there and priests at the Egyptian Thebes, was in terms of myths that are not in any way related to Danaos or
Kadmos.122
As I have mentioned, Herodotos was accused by Plutarch, in the 2nd century AD, of being the 'father of lies' and tends today to be treated with indulgent condescension by scholars working within the Aryan Model, who are especially scornful of his 'credulity'. However, he did
not rely entirely on legends when he derived Greek customs from the E · I d E ' . I 123
ast III genera an gypt III parncu ar:
I will never admit that the similar ceremonies performed in Greece and Egypt are the result ofmere coincidence - had that been so, our rites would have been more Greek in character and less recent in origin. Nor will I allow that the Egyptians ever took over from either this custom or any other. 124
Thus Herodotos would seem to have been using reason rather than a blind faith in tradition, and the method ofcompetitive plausibility which would seem entirely appropriate for such a subject. We are not concerned here with the rightness or wrongness of his c()H.clusions, however, but merely with the facts that he himselfbelieved in them and that he was being relatively conventional in doing so. The latter claim would seem to be substantiated by the earlier references to the colonizations, and by the acceptance of his ideas on them by the Overwhelming majority of later Greek writers. Such an acceptance is particularly impressive in view of the passionate Greek chauvinism of these times, and the Greeks' unease with or dislike of traditions that made them culturally inferior to the Egyptians and Phoenicians, who were still very much around. It may well have been for this kind of reason that Ilerodotos appears to have been on the defensive, not about the existence ofthe colonizations but about the extent ofGreek cultural
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 101
borrowings from Egypt and Phoenicia. It is this unease which leads us to the second great Greek historian, Thucydides, who lived from 460 to
400BC•
THUCYDIDES
The early- 19th-century critics made great play of the 'silence' ofsome authorities on the colonizations, and the historian they clearly had in mind was Thucydides. The latter's introduction to his history does not mention Kadmos or Danaos, although it does mention Pelops' invasion of Greece from Anatolia. Thucydides also stated that at one time
'Carians and Phoenicians inhabited most of the islands', and he . ld fi B' 11' 125
referred to the Danaans and to Kadmels as an 0 name or 010 a. He also described the Pre-Pelopid kings of Argos as descendants of Perseus, whom Herodotos had seen either as a 'genuine Egyptian' or as an 'Assyrian,.126 Nevertheless, there is no mention of Kadmos or
Danaos, or oftheir invasions. Given the frequent references to the colonizations in Herodotos and the Tragedies in the decades before he wrote, Thucydides must have known the traditions and his omission must be seen as the result of a conscious decision. It is extremely unlikely that this was reached because he possessed evidence disproving them, for in that case he would almost certainly have included it both to bolster his reputation as a historian and also because, as will be argued below, the invasions were offensive to his historical framework. A more charitable explanation would be that as a self-consciously 'critical' historian he was reluctant to deal with unverifiable legends. The· force ofthis argument is weakened, however, by his mention of the still more distant myth of Hellen son of Deukalion - the survivor ofthe Flood. 127
One of the reasons Thucydides has had such an appeal during the th h· h' . I . , . , 128
last three centuries is at IS Istonca VIew was progressive. According to it, the nearer one came to the present, the greater and more effective political organization became. Hence he tended to play down Mycenaean achievements and to emphasize that society's instability and the chaos of the succeeding 'Dark Ages'. This, for instance, helps to explain his denial that Homer had any sense of the



102 BLACK ATHENA
Hellenes as a single people. 129 According to him, history built up to the unprecedented might of his two protagonists, Athens and Sparta, so that his life spanned, and his work described 'The greatest disturbance in the history of the Hellenes, affecting also a large part of the
non-Hellenic world, and indeed I might almost say, the whole of mankind.'130
This quite extraordinary claim was incompatible with the notion that the Trojan War had involved the Hellenes as a people. Acceptance of the colonizations would have been still more devastating to his historical framework. The distances covered, the scale of operations, and the massive long-term consequences ofthe legendary invasions would have shown up the essentially trivial nature ofthe Peloponnesian War, which has been made great only by Thucydides' history ofit.
An even more important inhibitory factor than what one might call his 'temporal chauvinism' was his nationalism - a word I use deliberately. Thucydides drew a rigid distinction between Hellene and 'barbarian' and his whole work was a paean to the uniqueness of Greek achievements, even the destructive ones. Thus the idea that the Egyptians, whom Athenians could now conquer, or Phoenicians, who formed the most terrible arm of Persian military power - its fleet _ should have played a central role in the formation of Greek culture was clearly disturbing to Thucydides' contemporaries.
Such an attitude would explain why Thucydides, the 'critical historian' who rejected legends, was able to mention Hellen, a purely national figure, but not civilizing foreigners like Danaos, Kadm'os or the Egyptian Kekrops. (Whether or not the desire to remove offensive legends can give impetus to the critical approach itselfwill be discussed in Chapters IV and VI.) This kind of 'nationalism' would seem to be typical in the aftermath ofthe Persian Wars ofthe early 5th century and the subsequent expansion ofGreek power: from this time on, one finds varying degrees ofhatred ofand contempt for 'barbarians' among most Greeks. In such an atmosphere one would expect Greek writers, if anything, to play down the legends ofcultural indebtedness to the Near East. Hence it would be easier to understand, for example, why any suggestions ofKekrops' Egyptian connections should be replaced by a view of him as autochthonous, or why Thucydides should omit the
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 103
legends altogether, than why Greeks should invent 'new' stories of foreign colonization and civilization.
ISOKRATES AND PLATO
In the early 4th century, the outstanding spokesman for Panhellenism and Greek cultural pride was the Athenian orator Isokrates. In a famous panegyric given at the Olympian festival of380 Be he called on Spartans and Athenians to drop their differences and join in a Panhellenic union against Persia and the barbarians. With a new degree of cultural security he proclaimed:
And so far has our city [Athens] distanced the rest of mankind in thought and in speech that her pupils have become the teachers of the rest of the world. She has brought it about that the name 'Hellenes' suggests no longer a race but an intelligence, and that the title 'Hellenes' is applied rather to those who share our culture than to those who share a common blood.131
The arrogance of this statement is surprising when one considers that many cultured Greeks, including Eudoxos, the greatest mathematician and astronomer ofthe 4th century, still felt obliged to study in Egypt.132 Not surprisingly, Isokrates was concerned about the colonizations:
In former times any barbarians who were in misfortune presumed to be rulers over the Greek cities [for example] Danaos, an exile from Egypt, occupied Argos; Kadmos from Sidon became king of Thebes ...133
It is important to note that despite Isokrates' clear dislike of the invasions, he did not question their historicity. However, he had a still greater ambivalence on the issue. He wrote an extremely flattering picture of Egypt in his Bousiris. At one level this speech was merely a rhetorical tour deforce, the defence ofa mythical king chiefly known for his practice of killing foreigners. Nevertheless, to be convincing, the speech had to appeal to conventional wisdom, and it clearly had very serious aspects. The land ofEgypt and its people were portrayed in it as the most blessed in the world, but above all the piece was a eulogy to



104 BLACK ATHENA
Bousiris as a mythical lawgiver and to the perfection of the constitution he had devised for Egypt.134 Isokrates admired the caste system, the rulership ofthe philosophers, and the rigour of the Egyptian philosopher/priests' paideia (education) that produced the an" theoretikos (contemplative man), who used his superior wisdom for the good of his state. 135 The division of labour allowed a 'leisure', scholt, which allowed for schole, 'learning'. Above all, he insisted that philosophia (philosophy) was, and could only have been, a product of Egypt. 136 This word seems to have been used by the Egyptianizing Pythagoreans for some time - possibly since the 6th century - but one of its earliest extant uses comes from Bousiris. 137 There is in fact no logical inconsistency between this deeply respectful attitude towards Egypt and Isokrates' passionate xenophobia. He did not deny the colonization, which at least since Herodotos had been associated with the implantation of Egyptian religion in Greece. Furthermore, his paean to the cultural triumph of Athens and Greece referred only to the present. It made no claims on the past. Nevertheless, there does seem to be a contrast in the two positions. At a superficial level it can be explained by the fact that the 'barbarians' with whom Isokrates was most concerned were the Persians and the Phoenicians, the latter because they formed much of the basis of the fleet and because his patron, the tyrant Evagoras, had seized his territory Salamis in Cyprus from Phoenicians. Furthermore, around 390 Be when Bousiris was written, a three-way alliance against Persia was made among Evagoras, Achoris, Pharaoh of Egypt, and Athens. 138 I believe, however, that the two paints of view can be int/grated at a much more fundamental level, as of Isokrates' attempt to unite Athens and Sparta against Persia. There is no doubt that Athenians at the end of the Peloponnesian War, at the tum of the 4th century, were
fascinated by the constitution of Sparta, been so successful
10\,..
an enemy. This has led scholars like the great 19th-century German Classicist Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, working within the Aryan Model, to postulate the existence of a *'Lakedaimonian Politics which had inspired Isokrates to write his Bousiris, and to argue that it was because Herodotos had claimed that the Spartans owed their institutions to Egypt that Isokrates had made Bousiris his ideal.139 The modern
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 105
French scholar Charles Froidefond contests this on the grounds that Bousiris looks nothing like the Lakedaimonian Politics written by Xenophon because Isokrates specified that the Spartans had borrowed only partially from Egypt, and because the military aspects of Spartan society which most impressed his generation were attributed to Lykourgos. It was only much later, in the 2nd century AD, that Plutarch claimed that Lykourgos had been an imitator of Egypt. 140 I agree with Froidefond that there is no need to postulate a *'Lakedaimonian Politics. On the other hand, we know that 'Post-War' Athenians were concerned with the secrets of Spartan success. Furthermore, scholars working within the Ancient Model have no doubt that the stories about Spartan, and specifically Lykourgan, institutional borrowings from Egypt were current at the tum of the 4th century because they were true. That is to say, the tradition is confirmed not merely by the nature ofcertain aspects ofSpartan society but by the strong Egyptian influences on Spartan Archaic art and the many
plausible Late Egyptian etymologies for the names of specifically
S . . . 141
partan Institutions. Isokrates insisted that the Spartans had failed to apply the Egyptian principle of the division of labour and that their constitution fell short of the perfection of the Egyptian model, about which he wrote: 'philosophers who undertake to discuss such topics and have won the
greatest reputation prefer above all others the Egyptian form of

Nevertheless, it has been attempted. l44 In any event, Isokrates was quite explicit about it: 'On a visit to Egypt he [Pythagoras] became a student of the religion of the people, and was the first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy.,145 Another less likely possibility is that by 'philosophers' Isokrates meant his great rival Plato and his Republic. 146 It is generally thought



106 BLACK ATHENA
that the latter was written between 380 and 370 BC, that is after Bousiris, c·390 . It is also believed that the work was the result of many years of thought and teaching, and that there were possibly earlier drafts. 147 The likelihood is, however, that priority should be given to Bousiris. Nevertheless, there are striking similarities between it and Plato's Republic. In the latter, too, there was a division oflabour based on castes ruled by enlightened Guardians produced by careful selection and rigorous education. Plato was sharply hostile to the turbulence of democratic politics in Athens, and this kind of model was clearly comforting.
To what extent can it be related to Egypt? Apart from the resemblance to the explicitly Egyptian Bousiris we know that Egypt, where Plato had spent some time, probably around 390 BC, was a central
concern of his later works. I48 In Phaidros, Plato had Sokrates declare that 'He [Theuth-Thoth the Egyptian god of wisdom] it was who invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry ... and most important ofall letters ...'149
In Philebos and Epinomis Plato went into more detail on Thoth as the creator ofwriting, even oflanguage and all sciences. ISO Elsewhere Plato praised Egyptian art and music and argued for their adoption in
Greece.ISI Indeed, the only reason for doubting that his Republic was based on Egypt is the fact that he does not say so in the text. This omission, however, has an ancient explanation. As his earliest commentator, Krantor, wrote within a few generations of Plato:
Plato's contemporaries mocked him, saying that he was not the inventor ofhis republic, but that he had copied Egyptian institutions. He attached so much importance to the mockers that he attributed to the Egyptians the story of the Athenians and the Atlantines to make them say that the Athenians had really lived under this regime at a certain moment in the past. IS2
Faced with all this evidence in favour of an Egyptian derivation, early modem scholars still associated Plato's Republic with Egypt. As Marx put it: 'Plato's RepUblic, in so far as division oflabour is treated in it, as
the formative principle ofthe state, is merely an Athenian idealization of the Egyptian system ofcastes.,IS3
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 107
Popper, who hates Plato, would have loved to tar him with an Egyptian brush. However, he was writing in a more systematically Aryanist age and, though fully aware of Krantor's charge, he has confined it to the footnotes and appears puzzled by Marx's remark. IS4 Some scholars favourable to Plato have forcefully denounced the idea that he favoured an Egyptian type of caste system. The majority simply omit any mention of Egypt in connection with the Republic. ISS In his dialogues, Timaios and Kritias, Plato referred to the wonders of the lost civilization of Atlantis and to its fiery collapse. It will be argued in Volume 2 that this refers to the volcanic destruction ofThera in 1626 BC and that the Atlanteans are an amalgam of northern peoples, the Hyksos who invaded Egypt in the middle of the 2nd millennium, and the 'Peoples of the Sea' who attacked it at the end of that millennium. What concerns us here, however, is Plato's perception of the historic relationships between Greece and Egypt. As has been mentioned in the Introduction, there was a widespread but only late-attested tradition that Athens had been founded by Kekrops, the Egyptian from the city of Sais on the Western Delta. There was also a recognition that Neit, the goddess ofthat city, was the same as Athena. IS6 In the famous passage on the myth ofAtlantis, Plato attributed to Kritias the story that when the great Athenian lawgiver Solon went to Sais in the early 6th century, when it was capital ofEgypt, he was treated as a kinsman because of the special relationship felt by Saitians for Athenians. He was even granted an interview with senior Egyptian priests, one of whom, having condemned Solon with the famous words '0 Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children. There is no such thing as an old Greek', went on to tell Solon that Athena had founded Athens before Sais, rather than the other way round. IS7 He explained that the reason for the Athenians' lack of knowledge about this and the general Greek ignorance about their own past was that Greek culture had been periodically destroyed by disasters of fire and water, leaving no memory of Athens' former glory. In Egypt, however, thanks to her favoured position, institutions had been preserved. IS8 Thus, for Plato, if one wanted to return to the ancient Athenian institutions one had to tum·· to Egypt. In this way he resembled Isokrates, who both called for a Panhellenic combination ofAthens and



108 BLACK ATHENA
Sparta and extolled the Egyptian constitution that was a purer version of the Lakedaimonian one. The deeper they went towards the true Hellenic roots ofGreece, the closer they came to Egypt. One reason for this was that both Isokrates and Plato maintained that the great lawgivers and philosophers like Lykourgos, Solon and Pythagoras had all brought back Egyptian knowledge. Furthermore, Isokrates and Plato both believed in the colonizations of Pelops, Kadmos, Aigyptos and Danaos and seem to have accepted with Herodotos that the 'barbarians' brought important cultural baggage with them.159 Even on the issue of the foundation of Athens, Plato was within the Ancient Model to the extent that he accepted that there was a 'genetic' cultural relationship between it and Sais. Thus, despite their ambivalence if not hostility to the ideas, the two leading intellectual figures ofthe early 4th century BC were forced to admit the critical importance of foreign colonization, and massive later cultural borrowing from Egypt and the Levant, in the formation of the Hellenic civilization they both loved so passionately.
ARISTOTLE
Aristotle was not only the pupil ofPlato, he also studied at the Academy under Eudoxos of Knidos, the great mathematician and astronomer who is reported to have spent sixteen months in Egypt shaving his head in order to study with priests there. 160 Aristotle was also heavily influenced by Herodotos on Egypt, and was clearly fascinated by the country. Although at times he stressed the antiquity of Mesopotamian and Iranian civilization, his considered opinion seems to have been that the Egyptians were the most ancient people. 161 Aristotle was equally contradictory on the issue of diffusionism. At times he stated his beliefin independent invention by different cultures, but at others he argued that the Egyptians had created the caste system and hence 'Egypt was the cradle of mathematics because the caste of priests were given great leisure, schole.,162 According to him, the priests had invented the mathematikai technai (mathematical arts), which included geometry, arithmetic and astronomy, which the Greeks were beginning to possess.1 63 In fact his admiration for Egypt went beyond
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 109
that of Herodotos in one respect. Where Herodotos believed that the Egyptians had developed geometry, the key science, for practical reasons - to measure land after landmarks had been washed away by the Nile Flood - Aristotle maintained that it had been developed theoretically by the priests. 164
THEORIES OF COLONIZATION
AND LATER BORROWING IN THE
HELLENISTIC WORLD
Amongst many other things Aristotle was, of course, the tutor of Alexander the Great. 165 With the extraordinary Macedonian conquest of the Persian Empire in the 330S BC, there was a great surge of Greek interest in all Oriental civilizations, and especially in that of Egypt. It was in the years immediately after the conquest that the Egyptian priest Manetho wrote a history of Egypt in Greek in which he set out the scheme of 33 dynasties which remains the basis of the his
toriography of Ancient Egypt. 166 It was also at about this time that Hekataios of Abdera set out his view that the traditions of the Egyptian expulsion of the Hyksos, the Israelite Exodus and that of Danaos' landing in Argos were three parallel versions of the same story:
The natives of the land surmised that unless they removed the foreigners their troubles would never be resolved. At once, therefore, the aliens were driven from the country and the most outstanding and active among them banded together and, as some say, were cast ashore in Greece and certain other regions; their teachers were notable men, among them being Danaos and Kadmos. But the greater number were driven into what is now called Judaea, which is not far from Egypt and at that time was utterly uninhabited. The colony was headed by a man called Moses.1 67
It seems to have been on this basis - and the belief expressed by Herodotos that the ancestry ofthe Spartan kings went up to the Hyksos colonists - that, sometime around 300 BC, Areios King of Sparta wrote toJerusalem beginning:



110 BLACK ATHENA
To Onias High Priest, greeting. A document has come to light which
shows that the Spartans andJews are kinsmen descended alike from Abraham. 168
References to the Egypto-Phoenician colonizations in the Hellenistic period are too frequent to be given in full here. Debates were not on the existence of the landings but on their specifics: the nationality of the leaders, their points of departure or their dates. 169
The tension between Greek cultural pride and respect for the ancient civilizations seems to have become even more intense with Alexander's extraordinary conquests before 330 Be. This can be seen, for instance, in the reactions to Zeno of Kition, the Phoenician who founded Stoicism at the tum of the 3rd century Be. He was
mocked by his rivals as a 'little Phoenician', yet as a pupil wrote of him:
With much toil thou didst found a great new school, Chaste parent of unfearing liberty, And ifthy native country was Phoenicia, What need to slight thee? Came not Kadmos thence, Who gave to Greece her books and art ofwriting?170
Diodoros Sikeliotes, writing in the I st century Be, expressed the same confusion, if not schizophrenia, on the issue of the 'barbarians' who civilized Greece near the beginning of his massive flbrary ofHistory when he wrote:
The first peoples which we shall discuss will be the barbarians, not that we consider them to be earlier than the Greeks, as Ephoros has said, but because we wish to set forth most ofthe facts about them at the outset, in order that we may not, by beginning with the various accounts given by the Greeks, have to interpolate in the different
narrations of their early history any event connected with another people. 171
In Volume V of his work Diodoros cited the Rhodian historian Zeno who maintained that Greeks - or the mysterious Heliadai from Rhodes - had brought culture to the Egyptians but a great flood had wiped out
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY III
all memory of it, just as the Athenians had forgotten that Athens was senior to Sais:
And it was because of reasons such as these that many generations later men supposed that Kadmos, the son of Agenor, had been the first to bring the letters from Phoenicia to Greece. 172
Presumably still following Zeno, Diodoros went on to detail how both Danaos and Kadmos had left traces on Rhodes while on their way to colonize Greece. 173 Like Plato's belief in the priority of Athens over Sais, Zeno's scheme is an inverted form of the Ancient Model rather than one within the Aryan Model. There is no mention of an invasion from north of Greece and the scheme still maintains a 'genetic' relationship between Greek and Egypto-Phoenician culture and civilization. The view that Greece civilized Egypt has been too much even for the most ardent Aryanists. Diodoros' modem translator, Professor Oldfather, notes at this point:
Book I, passim, presents the claims put forward by the Egyptians for the priority oftheir civilization; the counterclaims ofthe Greeks here set forth are empty boasting.174
The main thrust ofDiodoros' work is his beliefin Egypt and, to a lesser extent, other Eastern civilizations as the fount ofworld civilization:
And since Egypt is the country where mythology places the origin of the gods, where the earliest observations ofthe stars are said to have been made, and where, furthermore, many noteworthy deeds of great men are recorded, we shall begin our history with the events connected with Egypt. 175
Not only did Diodoros frequently refer to the colonizations of Thebes and Argos by Kadmos and Danaos but he devoted considerable space, near the beginning ofhis work, to Saitian claims that Kekrops and other early Athenian kings had been Egyptians, and their plausible arguments for a special relationship between Athens and Egypt.176 This colonization was not generally accepted in Hellenistic and Roman times, but belief in the colonizations of the Western Peloponnese and Thebes seems to have been universal. Pausanias'



112 BLACK ATHENA
Guide to Greece, written in the 2nd century AD, is full of references to them:
The people ofTroizen [in the Argolid] ... say the first human being to exist in their country was Oros, which looks to me like an Egyptian name, certainly not a Greek one. 177
There is another road out ofLema right down by the sea to what they call the Birthplace; by the sea is a little sanctuary of Poseidon of the Birth. Next to this are the landings, where they say Danaos and his sons first landed in the Argolid. 178
The linking ofthe legendary landings with birth is fascinating, as is the fact that Poseidon was the chief god of the Mycenaeans and Seth _
whom I see as his Egyptian counterpart - was the chief god of the
Hyksos:1 79
In my opinion the Nauplians were Egyptians at an earlier period who arrived in the Argolid with Danaos' fleet and were settled three generations later by Amymone's son Nauplios in Nauplia. 180
When Kadmos marched in [to the Thebaid] with a Phoenician army and they [the Hyantes and the Aones] lost a battle, the Hyantes ran away the very next night, but the Aones made a ritual supplication so that Kadmos let them stay and intermarry with his Phoenicians. 181
The relation of the names Hyantes and the Aonesto the name Ionian and the Egyptian >/wn (tywJ (barbarian) has been discussed above (see p. 83)·182 There is no doubt, then, that Pausanias was convinced ofthe actuality of the colonizations and believed that there were still many direct signs of them in his time, the 2nd century AD. I
PLUTARCH'S ATTACK
ON HERODOTOS
The 2nd century AD also saw the closest to what one might call an attack on the Ancient Model. It came in a long essay by the prolific writer Plutarch, entitled 'On the Malice of Hemdotos', in which he levelled
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 113
many charges against Herodotos, one of which was that of being 'philobarbarous':
He says that the Greeks learnt about processions and national festivals from the Egyptians as well as the worship ofthe twelve gods; the very name ofDionysos, he says, was learnt from the Egyptians by Melampous, and he taught the rest ofthe Greeks; and the mysteries and secret rituals connected with Demeter were brought from Egypt by the daughters of Danaos ... Nor is this the worst. He traces the ancestry of Herakles to Perseus and says Perseus, according to the Persian account, was an Assyrian; 'and the chiefs ofthe Dorians' he says, 'would be established as pure-blooded Egyptians ...'; not only is he anxious to establish an Egyptian and a Phoenician Herakles; he says that our own Herakles was born after the other two, and he wants to remove him from Greece and make a foreigner out ofhim. Yet of the learned men of old neither Homer nor Hesiod ... ever mentioned an Egyptian or a Phoenician Herakles, but all of them
knew only one, our own Herakles who is both Boiotian and
Ar . 183
gIve ...
Plutarch clearly believed that his audience would be outraged by Herodotos' ideas on these subjects, but it is interesting to note that he cites only ancient authority on the question ofHerakles and that he does not confront the colonizations of Danaos and Kadmos directly. Given the deep knowledge and appreciation of Egyptian religion expressed in his On Isis and Osiris, and above all his conviction ofits essential identity with Greek religion, there is also serious doubt as to whether Plutarch himself disbelieved Herodotos' claims for the foreign origins of so much of Greek culture. It would seem more likely that Plutarch's assault on Herodotos' 'barbarophilia' was merely a tool to be used in his general attack upon him. It is also fascinating to note that none of the modem detractors of the Ancient Model relied on this essay. One reason for this, as two of his translators have written, is that
While this essay has offended lovers of Herodotos, it has also disturbed admirers of Plutarch, who have found it hard to believe



BLACK ATHENA
that so kindly and good-natured an author could himself write with such fierce malice and thus lay himself open to charges similar to those he levels against Herodotos. 184
More importantly, the modern scholars have been eager to rely on 'ancient' sources rather than 'late' ones, by which they - living in the 19th or 20th century AD - mean authors writing after the 5th century Be. This preference is influenced by - ifnot based on - the fact that in Late Classical and Hellenistic Greece the overwhelming weight oftestimony is in favour both of the colonizations and of Greek religion having derived from the Egyptian. Before coming to this, however, we should consider the impact of Egyptian religion on Greece in Hellenistic and Roman times.
THE TRIUMPH OF
EGYPTIAN RELIGION
The movement among Greeks and other Mediterranean peoples to worship the gods under their Egyptian names began well before Alexander's conquests and the syncretism ofHellenistic times. Early in the 5th century Be the poet Pindar wrote a Hymn to Ammon, which opened 'Ammon King ofOlympos'. This cult of the Libyan variant of the Egyptian Amon was attached to Pindar's native town ofThebes. 185
However, it was also strong in Sparta, and Pausanias wrote about the
"
sanctuary ofAmmon in Aphytis in Sparta:
The Lakonians seem to have used the Libyan oracle more than anyone else in Greece since the beginning. Ammon is not more honoured by the Libyan Ammonians than he is at 186
It is impossible to say what Pausanias meant by 'since the beginning'. In any event, it must have been before the end of the 5th century that the brother ofthe great Spartan general Lysander was called Libys because the family had a traditional relationship with the basileis (kings or priests) of the Ammonians, and Lysander himself consulted the oracle.187 By the 4th century Am(m)on was being worshipped in Athens, and one of its sacred triremes was dedicated to him. 188
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY lIS
ALEXANDER SON OF AMMON
Alexander the Great clearly considered himself to be a son ofAmmon. After his conquest of Egypt he set out into the desert to consult the god's great oracle at the Libyan oasis of Siwa. The oracle told Alexander that he was the god's son, which explains why from then on Alexander's coins portrayed him as a horned Ammon.189 Modern historians describe as slanders many reports that in the last year of his life Alexander dressed himselfand demanded worship in the guise of a number ofgods and goddesses and that'Alexander even desired people to bow to the earth before him, from the idea that Ammon was his father rather than Philip.,190
Who, then, was the son of Ammon? According to early Egyptian tradition, Osiris was the son ofRa. With the rise of the cult ofAmon in the 12th Dynasty the two came together as Amon-Ra. By the late New Kingdom there was seen to be a mystic union between Ra and Osiris. 191 Thus the thorough confusion between Ammon and Dionysos found in Diodoros Sikeliotes or his source from the 2nd century Be, the Alexandrian Dionysios Skytobrachion, would seem to have precedents in Egyptian theology}92 In any event Alexander appears to have seen himself as this syncretic divinity, both Ammon and his son. There is no doubt that the actual conquests of Alexander increased the importance of the myths of the vast eastern civilizing expedition of Dionysos or - as Diodoros named him - of Osiris, traces ofwhich can be found in Egyptian tradition from the 18th Dynasty or even the Middle Kingdom. 193 Even in Greece, asJames Frazer pointed out, the scheme had been outlined by Euripides before Alexander was born.194 Alexander's relationship with Dionysos was strained and he felt some competition with him, at least after his conquests. 195 When he reached Nysa in the mountains of North-West India and was told by the inhabitants ofits association with the god, it is reported that
he was very ready to believe the tale about the journeys ofDionysos; he was also ready to credit that Nysa was founded by Dionysos, in which case he had already reached the point which Dionysos had reached, and would go even further than Dionysos.196



1I6 BLACK ATHENA
There are also unreliable reports of his travelling through India 'in mimicry ofthe Bacchic revelry ofDionysos'. 197 There is no doubt about the political and cultic attention he attached to his many long drinking bouts, and the civilizing mission of OsirislDionysos provides a crucial background for Alexander's own activities along these lines. Thus his identification as the son of Ammon, parallel to and rival of Dionysos, was central to his life project. Aryanist historians have preferred to dwell on his reading ofXenophon and his identification and rivalry with Achilles, and there is no doubt that these were significant factors in his decision to invade Asia. But they were less important than his essentially Egyptian religious mission. The fact that his body was buried in Egypt rather than in Greece or Persia cannot simply be attributed to the ruthlessness ofhis general Ptolemy, who succeeded him as ruler of
Egypt. It shows the centrality of that country to Alexander's life and self-image. 198
Ptolemy and his successors, right up to the Kleopatra of Caesar and Antony, made great use ofEgyptian religion both to gain the respect and affection of their Egyptian subjects and to give them cultural power when dealing with the other states that arose from the fragments of Alexander's empire.199 Nevertheless, this is not enough to explain the huge expansion of Egyptian religion during this period, in what has been called 'the conquest of the Occident by Oriental Religion'.200
The Egyptian mother goddess Isis, for in§tance, had been worshipped in Athens since the 5th century, not merely by resident Egyptians
but by native Athenians.201 By the 2nd century BC there was a temple of Isis near the Akropolis and Athens was officially encouraging its dependencies to take up Egyptian cults.202 Even on Delos, especially sanctified to Apollo, cults of Isis and Anubis were made official in a move that was in no way connected to the Ptolemaic }(jngdomwhich had lost control of the island by that time.203 Indeed, by the 2nd century AD Pausanias, who made no mention of other Oriental cults, reported Egyptian temples or shrines in Athens, Corinth, Thebes and many places in the Argolid, Messenia, Achaia and Phokis.204
It should be stressed that Greece had experienced only part ofa wave that had spread throughout the Roman Empire.2os For instance, the most important shrines discovered at Pompeii from 79 AD - when it was
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY 1I7
overwhelmed by the eruption of Vesuvius - were 'Egyptian'. Tiberius had banished Egyptian - and Jewish - religion from Rome itself. But the cults were soon restored and later emperors, particularly Domitian
and Hadrian, were passionately devoted to the Egyptian gods.206 The latter even tried to tum his favourite Antinoos into an Egyptian god, and
in many ways his extraordinary pleasure garden at Tivoli, east ofRome, • c. I c. hi d" I 207
is best seen as an EgyptIan lunerary comp ex lor s Ivme over. Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Caracalla, Diocletian and other emperors visited Egypt and all reports emphasized how respectful they were towards Egyptian religion and culture.208 Whatever their personal
feelings, such an attitude would seem to have been politically necessary given the central role of Egyptian religion throughout the Empire. Such enthusiasm provoked a backlash. The modem Dutch scholars Smelik and Hemelrijk, who have tried valiantly to scrape up instances of Greek hostility to Egyptian culture, have a rather easier time when it comes to Rome. The weak point in the Egyptian armour was the worship of animals. Cicero, for instance, found this strange 'in that most uncorrupted nation of the Egyptians which preserves written records of events ofvery many ages,.209 The later satirists Juvenal and
Lucian were unrestrained in their attacks on this zoolatry, and on Egypt
as a whole.2IO Most writers believed this worship to be symbolic and allegorical, a view laid out most clearly by Plutarch in On Isis and Osiris. This work is recognized even by scholars working in the Aryan Model as the single most important source on Egyptian religion; furthermore, its interpretations have increasingly been confirmed with the advance of Egyptology.211 Plutarch spelled out in detail the general image of Egyptian religion that appears to have been common among cultivated Greeks, at least since the 4th century BC. According to this, the zoolatry and apparent superstition of Egyptian religion were merely an allegorical veneer for the masses: the priests, and!or those who had been initiated, knew that in reality the zoolatry and fantastic myths concealed deep abstractions and a profound understanding of the universe. In On Isis and Osiris, Egypt's religious philosophy was principally concerned not with the ephemeral, material world of'becoming' with its growth and decay, but



118 BLACK ATHENA
with the immortal realm of 'being' which was especially manifested in numbers, geometry and astronomy.
All this, of course, strikingly resembled the ideas of Plato, the Pythagoreans and Orphics, not only in content but often in the form of words used to describe them. 19th-and 20th-century scholars have therefore seen Plutarch's work as a prime example of what is called interpretatio Graeca, which has been well described as follows:
The Greek obsenrer was not usually in a position to understand Egyptian religion from the inside; an initial obstacle was his ignorance of Egyptian. Sometimes an equation or an explanation was based on a misunderstanding of an Egyptian phenomenon, or on a modification introduced on a Greek parallel. Each deviation, whether radical or slight, contributed to a remove from the true picture.2IZ
A major modern scholar has devoted a whole book to this Greek 'mirage' of Egypt.213 This interpretatio Germanica or axiom - that Egyptian religion and philosophy were necessarily crude and shallow has difficulties with such superbly intelligent men as Eudoxos who, according to all reports, lived with the priests and learnt Egyptian, and clearly had a great respect and enthusiasm for Egyptian culture. The fundamental weaknesses ofthe modern scheme, however, are its lack of self-consciousness and the positivist sense of Besserwissen, 'knowing better' than the Ancients. This is true even ofthe beloved Greeks, who were superior in every aspect of their culture except their writing of ancient history and their understanding of Greece's relationships with other cultures.
ForPlutarch's contemporaries and later within the Ancient Model, the striking similarities between Plutarch's description of Egyptian religion and philosophy and those of Plato and the Pythagoreans provided no difficulty whatever. They were simply the result of the fact that - as everyone knew - Plato, Pythagoras and Orpheus had taken their ideas from Egypt. Moreover, Plutarch also maintained that there were more fundamental links between Egyptian and Greek religion. On Isis and Osiris was dedicated to Klea, to whom he wrote:
[CH. I] THE ANCIENT MODEL IN ANTIQUITY
That Osiris is identical with Dionysos who could more fittingly know than yourself, Klea? For you are the head of the inspired maidens [devotees ofDionysos] ofDelphi, and have been consecrated by your father and mother in the holy rites of Osiris.
He went on to give details of cultic similarities between Egyptian and Delphic cults.214 Altogether, Plutarch identified Dionysos with Osiris three times in this work.2IS Although he was not as explicit on the identity of Isis and Demeter, there is no doubt that he was equally certain about it. There are, for instance, many detailed parallels between his descriptions of Isis' troubles in Byblos and those portrayed in Eleusis in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. This is frequently used by Aryanistscholars as a clear example ofPlutarch's interpretatio Graeca.216 It may be so in this case. I would argue, however, that it is probable that the mystery cult at Eleusis, to which the Hymn is clearly linked, originated from Egypt, as the Ancients believed.217 Even ifitwere not, there is archaeological evidence to show that Isis was identified with Demeter at Eleusis by the 9th ecentury - that is, before the conventional dating of the Hymn.2IB In any event, there is absolutely no reason to doubt that Plutarch saw the two as manifestations of the same divinity. All in all, it is clear that Plutarch believed both that much of Greek philosophy had been introduced from Egypt and that there was a fundamental unity between Egyptian and Greek religion. He further maintained that the former was purer and older. This view of Egyptian religion played a central role in the two major 'novels' of the 2nd century AD, Heliodoros' Aithiopika and Apuleius' Metamorphoses or The Golden Ass. In his morally elevating and romantic story with a beautiful and virtuous Ethiopian - but not black heroine, Heliodoros expressed great admiration for the Ethiopians and their gymnosophists (naked philosophers or gurus), but Aithiopika is focused on Egypt and the moral superiority of its religion. It also stresses the passionate interest taken in it by Greek priests, who saw it as the key to their own cults. When talking about the priests of Delphi bombarding a visiting Egyptian with questions, the author wrote:
In short, they forgot none of the interesting features of Egypt, for there is no country in the world which Greeks prefer to hear about.219



120 BLACK ATHENA
Apuleius' The GoldenAss, by contrast, is a satire, but at its serious centre are Egyptian mysteries and the figures of Isis, the mistress of disguises and transformations, and Osiris/Dionysos behind her. At the book's climax the goddess announces to the hero:
Thus the Phrygians, earliest ofall races, call me Pessinuntia, mother of all gods. Thus the Athenians, sprung from their own soil, call me Cecropeian Minerva and the sea-tossed Cyprians call me Paphian Venus, the archer Cretans Diana, Dictynna, and the trilingual Sicilians Proserpine; to the Eleusinians I am Ceres, the ancient godess, to others Juno, to others Bellona and Hecate and Rhamnusia. But the Ethiopians, who are illumined by the first rays of the sun-god as he is born every day, together with the Africans and Egyptians, who excel through having the original doctrine, honour me with my distinctive rites and give me my true name ofQueen Isis.22o
The belief that Egyptian religion and rites were the original and 'true' ones made the Greek and other local forms redundant, and this explains the massive turning away from the latter. As the Neo-Platonist philosopher lamblichos wrote at the end ofthe pagan period in the 4th century AD:
Rather think that as the Egyptians were the first ofmen to be allotted the participation of the gods, the when invoked rejoice in Egyptian rites.221
The repetition and frequent quotation in this chapter comes from the need I feel to hammer home the conventionality in Antiquity ofa picture that is very unconventional in modern Classical studies. The unfamiliarity ofthis approach itselfunderscores the fact that proponents ofthe Aryan Model are unable to quote extensively to back their case. All I claim in this chapter is that after the 5th century BC - the only period from which we have any substantial knowledge of them - the Ancient Greeks, though proud ofthemselves and their recent accomplishments, did not see their political institutions, science, philosophy or religion as original. Instead they derived them - through the early colonization and later study by Greeks abroad - from the East in general and Egypt in particular.
CHAPTER II
EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND
GREEK TRANSMISSION FROM THE
DARK AGES TO THE RENAISSANCE
I
N THIS CHAPTER I am concerned with the survival ofAncient Egypt after the fall of its high civilization. In the first place we find the survival of Egyptian religion both within Christianity and outside it in heretical sects like those of the Gnostics, and in the Hermetic tradition that was frankly pagan. Far more widespread than these direct continuations, however, was the general admiration for Ancient Egypt among the educated elite. Egypt, though subordinated to the Christian and biblical traditions on issues 'of religion and morality, was clearly placed as the source of all 'Gentile' or secular wisdom. Thus no one before 1600 seriously questioned either the belief that Greek civilization and philosophy derived from Egypt, or that the chiefways in which they had been transmitted were through Egyptian colonizations of Greece and later Greek study in Egypt.
THE MURDER OF HYPATIA
In 390 AD the temple of Serapis and the adjacent great library of Alexandria were destroyed by a Christian mob; twenty-five years later, the brilliant and beautiful philosopher and mathematician Hypatia was gruesomely murdered in the same city by a gang ofmonks instigated by



II/
I 122 BLACK ATHENA
St Cyril. These two acts ofviolence mark the end of Egypto-Paganism and the beginning ofthe Christian Dark Ages. 1 It is hardly surprising that scholars working within the Aryan Model prefer to neglect the Christian factor and see these events as representing a resurgence of Egyptian Oriental fanaticism against Hellenistic rationalism.2 But, if one disregards the absurd implication that Europeans cannot be fanatical, these two explanations - that the fanatical mob was both Christian and Egyptian - are not mutually exclusive. By the 4th century AD, Egypt was a passionately - if not the most passionately - Christian province in the Roman Empire.
THE COLLAPSE OF
EGYPTO-PAGAN RELIGION
What had happened? Egyptian religion had collapsed with remarkable speed between 130 and 230 AD. Why did the heartland of paganism convert to Christianity earlier and more fervently than all the other Roman provinces? This is linked to the larger problem: why did the whole of the pagan world convert to Christianity? For Christian historians this event is a non-problem: naturally, when the Egyptians or any other people saw the light of'true religion', they left their idolatrous paganism. For historians without this prior commitment, the phenomenon is less easy to explain. At a broader level it can be argued that with the anomia and the breakdown of traditional local structures in the Hellenistic and Roman empires there was a natural tendency towards monotheism, a heavenly reflection of terrestrial world empires. This would be demonstrated first by the enormous expansion of Judaism - largely through proselytizing - throughout the Mediterranean\after 300 BC. Indeed, by the middle ofthe 1st century AD Jews formed between 5 and 10 per cent of the population of the Roman Empire.3 In 116-17, however, there was a huge revolt in the Diaspora, far greater than the better-known ones of the Zealots and Bar Kokhba inJudaea of 66-70 and 132-5. The Diaspora revolt was followed by a genocidal repression in Cyprus, Cyrene and, above all, Alexandria which completely destroyed the brilliant culture of Hellenized Jewry.4 Even before that, although
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 123
Jews formed a considerable proportion of the population of Egypt, Judaism was too foreign to absorb Egyptian culture. Like the Indians and Chinese in 19th- and 20th-century colonial empires, or the later Jews in Eastern Europe, the Egyptian Jews were middlemen between the ruling Greeks and the Egyptian people. And, in all these cases, it suited the rulers very well to maintain tension between the natives and the allogenes, the foreign middle class. Thus for the rest of the 2nd century and beyond, the elimination of the Jews meant that Christianity - which in any event was more loosely tied to a particular people - had no serious rival as a proselytizing religion. It would seem plausible to suppose that Egyptian religion collapsed along with the pharaonic state and Egyptian nationality. This argument has some force, but it also has some problems. Egypt had been ruled by foreigners for most of the time since 700 BC; some, like the Ethiopians and the Ptolemaic Greeks, had ruled their whole empires from Egypt, but the Persians were like the Romans in considering Egypt as a - rather special- province. Most rulers considered good relations with Egyptian religion essential to their control of the country. It is true that the Persians did at times persecute Egyptian religion, but on the whole they too worked with it.5 The very favourable attitude of their Macedonian successors has been described in Chapter I: Egyptian religion flourished and expanded throughout this period, apparently reaching a peak in the first halfofthe 2nd century AD. This historical pattern makes its subsequent collapse seem all the more remarkable. For, if foreign persecution had been the crucial factor, the collapse would have been more likely in the 6th or 4th century BC, under the Persians, than in the 2nd century AD when Egyptian religion was basking under Roman imperial favour. The Ptolemies in Egypt, rather like the Mongols and Manchus in China, were - while posing as its champions - very conscious of the dangers of absorption by the native civilization. They were determined to preserve their own culture and rule through Greeks. Kleopatra VII, the queen ofAntony and Caesar, was the first - and last - ofthe dynasty to learn Egyptian. Thus although the Egyptian priests objectively collaborated with the new foreign rulers, as they had with the earlier ones, they tried personally to stay aloofand to some extent continued to



124 BLACK ATHENA
represent Egyptian 'nationalism'. By the 2nd century AD, however, after 400 years of Greek rule, the Roman rulers and the Macedonian and Egyptian upper classes - including the priesthoods - had fused in a common Hellenic civilization with Egyptian religion. The very enthusiasm of the Roman emperors for Egyptian religion and its 'internationalization' seems to have weakened the priests' positions as champions ofEgypt.
There is no doubt that by 3rd and 4th centuries AD there was a definite class basis to hostility to the old religion and that, as elsewhere, the Christians initially represented the poor and then the middle classes against the rich. It is therefore possible that - despite the wellpublicized austerity of the priests' lifestyle - the huge wealth of the temples and the priesthood's exploitation of the poor caused resentment.6 Thus after the 2nd century, despite the fact that Christianity came from Palestine and was consciously international, it came to represent the poor and middle-class Egyptians against the cosmopolitan Hellenized upper classes with their Egyptian pagan religion.
CHRISTIANITY, STARS AND FISH
There is little doubt that these social and national factors played a major part in the destruction of organized Egyptian religion. But they seem to have been slowly-growing, long-term tensions or flaws rather than acute problems, and two new features were present in the 2nd century. First - as conventional wisdom rightly maintains - there was the availability of Christianity, monotheist and universal in a way that Judaism could never quite be, and with an exceptional enthusiasm and capacity for organization. Secondly, there was the general belief that
the old world was coming to an enf and that a new age was about to begin.
Messianism or millenarianism is the beliefin the imminent arrival of a new order or millennium of harmony and justice when the Messiah and the saints 'go marching in'. It is a frequent response to distress ofall sorts, but especially to military conquest and economic and cultural domination by foreigners. Indeed, the idea that some outside force will
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 125
sweep down and overthrow the present illegitimate rulers so that 'the first shall be last and the last shall be first' has been fundamental to Judaism, at least since the captivity in Babylon in the 6th century BC. It is clear, however, that this feeling intensified after about 50 BC and was very prominent for the next 200 years; furthermore, the sense of apocalypse was not restricted to Jews. The crisis can be partially explained by a number of political and economic changes. There were the unprecedented success of the Romans in uniting the Mediterranean, the savage ,civil wars between the Roman warlords; and finally, in 3 I BC, the establishment of the Roman Empire - often portrayed as a new age - under Augustus. For the Jews, there was the additional factor ofthe change in Roman policy from friendship with them as allies against their common enemy the Greek Seleukids, who ruled most ofSouth-West Asia; to neutrality, to preserve the balance of power; to hostility, once the Hellenistic kingdoms had been crushed and the whole Empire was turned into a Roman-Greek condominium. Messianism had long been central to Jewish tradition. The first Messiah in the Bible was Cyrus, the king of Persia who released theJews - at least those who wanted to leave - from Exile in Babylon.7 Jewish Messianism seems to have retained the hope that deliverance would come from the East and in particular from the Parthians, the new rulers of Persia who also ruled Mesopotamia, with its large Jewish population, and who like the Jews had also fought a war of independence against the Seleukids. There is also little doubt that the risings of 115 and I 16, which were clearly seen by their participants in Messianic terms, were connected to the Emperor Trajan's major attack on Parthia in those years. 8 I should reiterate, however, that the Messianism between 50 BC and ISO AD, and the idea that a new age was dawning, were not restricted to Jews, nor can they be completely explained in terms of the Roman political changes mentioned above. Another element was the astrological change from the age of Aries to that of Pisces. Without getting into the argument over when and by whom the precession of the equinoxes was discovered, there is no disagreement that it was widely known by 50 BC.9 The significance in this context is that over the period



BLACK ATHENA
between 50 BC and 150 AD the spring equinox shifted from Aries to Pisces.'*'
It is only in this concatenation of political, economic, social and astrological changes that one can understand the Roman poet Virgil's Fourth Eclogue, written in 40 BC, which states near its beginning:
Now ... the great line of centuries begins anew ... Only do thou, sweet Lucina, smile on the birth of a child, under whom the iron brood shall first cease, and a golden race spring up throughout the world! Thine own Apollo is now king!
Virgil goes on to greet the child's father, Pollio, who has become Consul, as bringing in 'a glorious age'; but history will repeat itself and there will be a new War ofTroy and other great historical events.10 With modern discomfort at what would seem to be a prefiguration of the advent of Christ, most Classicists have used their monist approach to claim that these are simply poetic conceits around the birth ofa friend's child. It would seem much more plausible to suppose that the poet- as a poet - employed several different levels ofmeaning: the birth ofPollio's child; the beginning of a peaceful age under his and Pollio's patron, Augustus. The words also seem to indicate the coming of a new young divinity. They certainly refer to a cosmic or astral change ofage, which can only be the new age of Pisces. Stars are often associated with great and Messianic leaders, from Cyrus, who founded the Persian Empire in the 6th century BC, to the Chinese rebel leader of the 8th century AD, An Lushan.II It is particularly striking to note how often stars appear in association with major leaders during the period ofcrisis from 50 BC to 150 AD; from the comet seen as representing the spirit of Julius Caesar to the star of
Bethlehem and that associated with Hadrian's new god Antinoos; while

,. The precession is the result of a wobble in the rotation of the solar system which results in the points fixed by that system changing in relation to the stars beyond. In the measure most commonly used, the spring equinox appears 'earlier' and 'earlier' in terms of signs of the zodiac. It is because the equinox shifts from one zodiacal 'house' to the one preceding it approximately every 2,100 years that astrologers are now telling us to prepare for the age of Aquarius a century or two hence, when the spring equinox will occur in that 'house'.)
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 127
the last Messianic leader ofJewish resistance was known - at least by his friends - as Bar Kokhba, 'son of a star'. Indeed, the aged Rabbi Akiba, the cautious and sane founder of modern Judaism who had lived through and accommodated himself to the catastrophic defeat and the destruction ofJerusalem in 70 AD, was so swept away by Bar Kokhba's initial successes that he saw it as the new age and quoted Numbers 24: 17 - 'a star hath trodden forth from Jacob'Y From Plutarch's On Isis and Osiris, we know the extreme importance attached to astronomical movements as signs of the ideal world of the stars and geoinetry and the integral relation seen, at least in late Egyptian religion, between the stars and the gods. We also know that astronomers in Hellenistic Egypt were concerned with the precession. During the 2nd century AD the impact of the precession would seem to have been redoubled by an extraordinary astronomical coincidence. 13 To explain: Ancient Egypt had a number of sophisticated calendrical systems. Its two most commonly used 'years' were one based on a civil calendar of 365 days, and the 'Sothic year' tied to the rising of the star Sirius, which was seen to presage the beginning of the Nile Flood. 14 As
the astronomical year is a little under 365.25 days, the civil year advanced beyond it at a rate of approximately a day every four years. The two coincided only every 1460 years, and such a coincidence was noted for 139 AD! Thus the Egyptian priesthoods, who were closely tied to the stars, were given a double message of the end of an epoch.
In 130 AD the Emperor Hadrian and his young lover Antinoos had long consultations with the priests ofThoth, the divinity ofwisdom and measurement, at his chief cult site of Hermopolis. Soon after that,
Antinoos was found drowned in the Nile; a major Egyptian tradition O " h ' 15
saw sins as avmg drowned. The whole affair was meant to be - and remains - a mystery. However, the consensus today is that it was a voluntary sacrifice, made to avert some sort ofcatastrophe.16 It is certain that Hadrian immediately proclaimed Antinoos to be a new Osiris and the cult that he promoted had a success which, though short-lived, seems to have gone beyond its imperial patronage.
Whether or not Antinoos was meant to be the new saviour for the new age can only be a matter for speculation. There is no doubt, however, that the Christians saw their new Osiris, Jesus, in this way. There were,



12B BLACK ATHENA
of course, many other traditional aspects of Christ, but at this point I should like to raise a new sacred image, that of the fish. Fish were not prominent in either the Egyptian or the Jewish religious traditions. In Egypt, certain fish were associated with certain gods, and in some Egyptian 'nomes' or districts particular species offish were worshipped and considered taboo. Furthermore in late times, legends arose that fish had eaten Osiris' phallus and the word bwt (fish), written as such, could mean 'abomination'. Nevertheless, fish cannot be considered in any way central to Egyptian religion. 17 Apart from the dubious case of the Philistine god Dagon, fish appear to have had no religious connotations in the Old Testament.18 In the New, by contrast, they playa prominent role. Key disciples were fishermen, and fishing images abound. There is the miracle of the two fishes and the five loaves of bread. Even more strikingly, in the Gospel according to St John, Christ gave his disciples fish in a symbolic last meal.19 This theme, and the idea that fish were central to the Last Supper, were standard in early Christian iconography.lo In the sense of transubstantiation, Christ was not merely bread or grain like Osiris, he was a fish or - as was equally often represented - two fishes. As Tertullian, the brilliant early Christian thinker, wrote around the year 200: 'We little fishes, after the image of our [Ichthys, the Greek word for 'fish'] are born in the water.'ll This belief explains the use of the symbol of the fish to represent Christ and the Christians. The latter is often attributed to the acrostic on oW'ttlQ (Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour). However, the symbol ofthe fish is attested, if anything, earlier than the spelling of the word, and it would seem more likely that the acrostic was an explanation of the symbol rather than the other way round. Interestingly, Christian representations ofthe fish first appear at the beginning of the 2nd century in Alexandria. All in all, there is very little doubt that despite the equally strong ram-lamb Arien symbolism surroundingJesus, the use ofa fish - or, more specifically, two fishes, as in the sign of the zodiac - shows that the early Christians saw themselves, and were seen by others, as followers ofthe new religion of the new Piscean age. Let me recapitulate - in the 2nd century AD, in addition to the
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 129
long-term social, economic and national pressures on Egyptian religion, the extraordinary coincidence ofthe change from Aries to Pisces and the completion of the cycle of the Sothic and civil years created a powerful self-destructive force at its astronomical heart. Furthermore, not only did Egyptian religion contain a deep cyclical sense but it was centred on the concepts ofbirth, death and rebirth. It even included the possibility that although the gods were long-lived, they were not necessarily immortal. As Professor Hornung writes:
We can therefore assume that the possibility of a time without the gods was much more firmly grounded in the Egyptians' awareness than the few clear allusions to it would suggest. A phrase such as m 4.rw nlrw 'in the realm of the gods', in the senses of 'so long as the gods are there' is found in Graeco-Roman temple texts ... otherwise eschatology is . . . the domain ofmagical spells.22
It is in this context that one must read the Lament found in one of the Hermetic Texts:
There will come a time when it will be seen that in vain have the Egyptians honoured the divinity with pious mind and with assiduous service. All their holy worship will become inefficacious. The gods leaving the earth will go back to heaven; they will abandon Egypt; this land, once the home of religion, will be widowed of its gods and left destitute. Strangers will fill this country, and not only will there no longer be care for religious observances but, a yet more painful thing, it will be laid down under so-called laws, under pain ofpunishments, that all must abstain from acts of piety or cult towards the gods ... The Scythian or the Indian, or some other such barbarous neighbour, will establish himself in Egypt.
However, as in many biblical prophecies and apocalypses, the 'malice' of the enemies oftrue religion would be destroyed by
the Lord and Father ... and by the demiurge of the One God ... either by effacing it in a deluge or by consuming it by fire, or by destroying it by pestilential maladies ... Then he will bring back the world to its first beauty ... That is what the rebirth of the world will

be: a renewal of all good things and most solemn restoration of Nature herself ...23
This concept ofperiodicity, of birth and death followed by rebirth, left an opening for the would-be restorers of Egyptian religion in the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. In the meantime, however, we must consider its metamorphosed survival in late Antiquity and under Early Christianity. In a general sense the passionate religiosity of the people and the subtle philosophy and theology of the priests attributed by Greek writers to the Egyptians continued in Early Christian times. Furthermore, at the level of church organization and doctrine, all Christianity - not just that ofEgypt - was deeply permeated by Egyptian religion.
THE RELICS OF EGYPTIAN
RELIGION: HERMETICISM,
NEo-PLATONISM AND GNOSTICISM
Apart from mentioning the striking parallels between Jesus and Osiris and the Mesopotamian Tamuz, deities of vegetation who are killed, mourned for and triumphantly resurrected, I will not go into the fascinating subject of specific survivals ofEgyptian and Mesopotamian religion in Christianity, as it leads us too far from the topic of this book.24 Here, we are interested in the remains ofinstitutional Egyptian religion and their survival on the fringes of orthodox Christianity. Egypt from 150 to 450 AD was undergoing a period of great political and religious uncertainty and diversity. Furthermore, the groups we are concerned with tended to believe that divinity could be reached individually or in esoteric sects, for which a rigorous and mystical initiation was necessary. One of the key elements of this was fearsome oaths of secrecy. These groups also tended to be hostile to explicit writings or 'publication', believing that true wisdom could be imparted only directly by the teacher to the disciple, in isolation and over a long period. They were convinced that it was difficult to describe 'the ineffable' in words, let alone in writing, and they insisted on the importance of mystery. It is extraordinarily difficult to describe them
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 131
and, even ifit were possible, it would be a fundamental betrayal oftheir thought to make it comprehensible - nevertheless, it is necessary to outline some general patterns.25 Late Antiquity was obsessed with the number three: this can be seen in Hermes Trismegistos and the Christian Trinity.26 Among the groups with which we are concerned - the Hermeticists, the Neo-Platonists and the Gnostics - there were trinities of two basic types. The first, to which the Christian form belongs, had a father god, a son who was the activating intellect of the father, and a third force mediating between the twO.27 A second, more common variant was based on the notion ofa 'hidden god', behind the demiurge or creator worshipped by the Jews, Christians and others. The two gods were seen either as distinct or mystically united: the Hidden God, 'the Good' or the First Principle of Platonic thought, was the pure thought, as opposed to the creator's action. The third member of the trinity was the most variable - being seen as the 'world soul', the 'mind of god', etc., or even the animated matter of the world or universe - but its essential function was the dialectical one of both mediating between the other members of the trinity and keeping them distinct. Paradoxically, the fact that the first god was hidden and ineffable was used to justify idolatry. As man could grasp only the finite, and the Hidden God was infinite, it could be only partially perceived. As the 2nd-century Sophist Maximus ofTyre wrote:
God ... greater than time and eternity and all the flow of being, is unnamable by any lawgiver, unutterable by any voice, not to be seen by any eye. But we, being unable to apprehend His essence, use the help of sounds and names and pictures, of beaten gold and ivory and silver, of plants and rivers, mountain tops and torrents, yearning for the knowledge of Him.
He continued - in a spirit that can, parenthetically, be directly traced forward to John Locke - to use this as an argument for religious toleration:
Let men know what is divine, let them know; that is all. If a Greek is stirred to the remembrance of God by the art of Pheidias, an



132 BLACK ATHENA
Egyptian by paying worship to animals, another man by a river, another by fire - I have no anger for their divergences; only let them know, let them love, let them remember.28
Hermeticism, Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism were 'twofold' philosophies, with superstition for the masses and true knowledge or gnosis for the elite. Gnosis, however, 'was not primarily rational knowledge ... we
could translate it as "insight", for gnosis involves the intuitive process of knowing oneself. ,29
Through education and moral and religious exercises the enlightened few could approach the Good, the First Cause, that was hidden to the masses who saw nothing beyond the demiurge. The introspection and elitism were connected to another feature that was completely foreign to orthodoxJudaism and Christianity - the beliefin the actual, or at least potential, divinity ofman. My own view is that this comes from the Egyptian beliefthat the dead pharaoh became Osiris. In Late Egyptian religion this belief was 'democratized' so that with dedication, good instruction and knowledge of the right procedures every person had the potential to be Osiris and to become an immortal. At a deeper and more vague level, however, I believe this can be traced to a distinction between the transcendent shepherd god ofthe pastoral Israelites and the sense ofPantheism and immanent divinity among the agricultural Egyptians. In the latter God can be in everything, including man.
The idea that man can become God leads easily from religion, in which the worshipper prays for help, guidance etc., into magic, where he can command such things. As the Neo-Platonist Plotinos said: 'The Gods must come to me, not I to them.,30 This pattern of thought goes beyond equality with God, to over him - even to the extent of man making GOd.31
To return now to the stars. Stars played a central role in all these 'power trips'. Although there were a number of different astronomical models, the most influential was that set out by the astronomer Ptolemy, who lived in Egypt in the 2nd century AD, just at the point of transition from the old religion to the new cults. According to Ptolemy the sun, the moon, the planets and the 'fixed' stars circled round the earth on their
tI
I
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 133
own spheres. Thus in order to reach the ideal realm one had to transcend them. Hermeticism and Neo-Platonism also contained the very Egyptian and non-Christian notions of the pre-existence of souls and metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls from one body to the next. This process involved passing beyond the spheres, and the new forms were to some extent moulded by the conjunctions of stars and
planets at the point of birth.32 • In her splendid political treatment ofthe GnostIcs, the contemporary scholar Elaine Pagels is sympathetic to them as champions of freedom and opponents ofthe rigidity, hierarchy and repression ofthe orthodox Church. Where the Gnostics had many teachers, texts and gospels, and challenged church authority, the orthodox Church was controlled by the bishops, restricted to approved teachings, and allowed only the four canonical Gospels. Pagels, however, makes less of the fact that the Gnostics seem to have been generally richer than the Orthodox, and that although in principle gnosis was available to everybody, the study needed for it required wealth and leisure.33 In this context Father Festugiere, who dominated Hermetic and Gnostic studies between 1930 and 1980, has distinguished between what he calls hennetisme savant and hennetisme populaire, by which he was contrasting the philosophy ofthe Hermetic Texts, on the one hand, with the magic and occult sciences associated with Hermeticism, on the other. However, as other scholars have pointed out, 'astrology, alchemy and magic are
d th r ,34
arcane disciplines and the practice of them was reserve to e e lte. The extreme example of this was the great Neo-Platonist philosopher and mathematician Hypatia, who could hardly have been more upperclass and elitist. At the theological level, too, the 'twofold philosophy' of the Gnostics - and the Neo-Platonists and Hermeticists - is inherently unequal. Despite its hierarchy, manipulation of authority and repression, the orthodox Church maintained one faith for all believers. The three schools' lack of formal organization and the necessary individualism of a system of beliefs that emphasized introspection would seem perfectly adapted for the situation after the collapse of institutional Egyptian religion. However, Egyptian polytheistic religion never had the organizational or theological unity of the monotheisms



134 BLACK ATHENA
that succeeded it. Furthermore, there are indications that at least a 'proto-Hermeticism' existed well before the 2nd century AD.
To resume the argument so far. The three schools of thought that emerged from the debris of Egyptian religion were Hermeticism, Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism. The Hermeticists remained defiantly Egyptian, the Neo-Platonists were more Hellenized and focused their devotion on the 'divine Plato', while the Gnostics saw themselves as Christians. There was, of course, diversity and rivalry - sometimes intense - both among and within the three schools. Nevertheless, not only did they resemble each other in form but their practitioners associated with each other and read each other's works.35
HERMETICISM - GREEK, IRANIAN,
CHALDAEAN OR EGYPTIAN?
There is little doubt that Hermeticism was the earliest of the three and had a critical influence on the formation ofthe other two movements.36 In addition, everyone agrees that Hermeticism contained Greek, Judaic, Persian, Mesopotamian and Egyptian influences. But because there is heated controversy on the relative extent and depth of these influences, it is necessary to consider the issue in the light of the sociology of knowledge before examining what I see as the mainly Egyptian roots of Hermeticism. The question of its relationship to Ancient Egyptian thought is, ofcourse, highly political. As Bloomfield, a historian ofliterature and art, wrote in 1952: 'Scholarship has veered from one extreme to the other on this question ofthe Egyptian elements of Hermeticism.,37 Related to this is the question of its age. The contemporary expert on Hermeticism, A. G. Blanco, writes: 'those who support the view that the [Hermetic] "Corpus" is ofEgyptian origin are also those who tend to push back the dates of the documents.>38
In this debate the two key figures have been Reitzenstein and Festugiere. Reitzenstein wrote voluminously on Hermeticism at the tum of the century and initially argued that it was Egyptian in inspiration. However, as the century - and the Extreme Aryan Model _ progressed, he changed his views until by 1927 he was arguing that it was essentially Iranian, hence Aryan.39 From the 1930S until quite
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 135
recently the field has been dominated by Father Festugiere, who 'concentrated almost entirely on the Greek influences to the Hennetica', and opposed the notion of any connection with an Egyptian mystery cult.40 On the face of it, it would seem reasonable to grant considerable Egyptian influence on a tradition whose literature was written by Egyptians, probably in Demotic or Coptic, in Egypt before the collapse of organized Egyptian religion.41 Furthermore, while ancient sources referred to Iranian-Zoroastrian and Chaldaean-Mesopotamian influences, no one in the Roman period challenged the idea that Hermeticism was essentially what it purported to be - Egyptian. I want to stress that there is a great deal at stake here. It is not merely that Hermeticism is integrally connected to Gnosticism and NeoPlatonism but that, as Father Festugiere has shown, it is closely related to Platonism as a whole. There is also a strong resemblance between
Hermeticism, the theology of the Gospel of St John, and some of St Paul's letters!Z The generally admitted closeness ofthese connections makes both the date and the 'Egyptianness' of the Hermetic Texts of critical importance. If the Texts antedate Christianity, and are predominantly Egyptian, another possible origin for what have generally been considered to be the Greek, Platonic elements of Christian theology would open up. It would also be very difficult to explain away Plutarch's 'Platonic' and 'Pythagorean' picture ofEgyptian religion as a delusion caused by Egyptomania or interpretatio Graeca. Ifthe texts were shown to be older still, it would be very hard to deny the ancient view that Plato and Pythagoras took their ideas from Egypt. Most modem scholarship on the dating of the Hermetic Texts still works in a framework established by the great French Protestant textual critic Isaac Casaubon in the early 17th century. Casaubon attacked the prevailing view of his time that the Texts were an extremely ancient repository of Egyptian wisdom. Using techniques for dating Latin texts developed at the tum ofthe 16th century, he argued that the theological similarities between the Hermetic Corpus and Saints John and Paul, and the close relation between Hermetic hymns and Psalms, clearly meant that Holy Writ predated the Hermetic Texts. In the same way, the resemblances to Plato - especially to what was then Plato's most



BLACK ATHENA
widely read work, the Timaios - must be the result of borrowing from the latter; in any event, Casaubon pointed out, there was no mention of Hermes Trismegistos in Plato, Aristotle or the other ancient writers.43 Modern scholars working in the Aryan Model rather than the Christian framework of Casaubon have made only minor adjustments to his scheme. First, they have no problem in deriving New Testament theology from Platonic thought and, to a lesser extent, they are prepared to admit early Iranian or even Indian influences on Hermeticism. In this way, the Aryan Model allows scholars to raise the date ofthe Hermetic Texts to the 3rd century BC, that is, any time after Plato. For instance, as Festugiere put it:
These allusions [to the cult of Thoth] do not permit us to conclude that the temples of Egypt under the pharaohs possessed in their archives a collection of works attributed to the god Thoth. Exactly the opposite, it seems that since the Ptolemies there was a Greek Hermetic literature.44
Others have not even availed themselves ofthis opportunity, preferring to date the Texts alongside the Gnostic and Neo-Platonic works in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Nevertheless many have, in fact, explored the possibility that the Hermetic tradition dates back to the 3rd century BC. The German historian Kroll argued in the I920S that the society described in Hermetic Texts, supposedly dating from the 2nd century AD, was that of Hellenistic, not Roman Egypt and was definitely one in which the temples were fully functioning.45 Kroll's view was supported in the
1930S by the great historian of Iranian Mithraism and late pagan religion Franz Cumont, in the light of editing newly discovered astrological Hermetic Texts. In addition to backing Kroll, Cumont indicated that astronomical indications from astrological texts pointed to the 3rd century BC, but he also went beyond this to claim:
The first Graeco-Egyptian astrologists did not invent the discipline they claimed to teach the Hellenic world. They used Egyptian sources going up to the Persian period which were themselves at least partially derived from ancient Chaldaean documents. Traces of
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 137
this primitive substratum still survive in our much later texts, erratic blocks transported on to more recent soil. When we find mentions there of 'the king ofkings' or 'satraps' we are no longer in Egypt but in the ancient Orient ... We limit ourselves to noting that in all appearances, the priests who were the authors of Egyptian astrology stayed relatively faithful to the ancient Oriental tradition.46
It is true that Cumont was a historian of the Persian religion, and that to some Northern Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Iranians were more 'Aryan' than the Greeks. But these facts do not significantly weaken the plausibility of the argument that although the heterogeneous Hermetic Corpus was clearly composed at different times, some of it antedates not merely Alexander the Great in the late 4th century but Plato fifty years earlier.47 Cumont's argument presents a serious problem to the Aryan Model because it means either that Plato's ideas coincided with the Hermetic Oriental-Egyptian ones or that they came from Egypt, as the Ancient Model maintained. The notion of Persian origin itself has problems in that the ideas of Solon, Pythagoras and others who are supposed to have visited Egypt before the Persian conquest of that country in 525 BC appear to have been very to those of Plato and Plutarch, which makes an Egyptian origin even more likely than a Persian one. On the question of the relative importance of Egyptian and 'Oriental' ideas, it is possibleand indeed probable - that there were considerable Mesopotamian influences on Egypt long before the 6th century BC. These must have intensified during the Persian occupations, and it was probably during these occupations that most Zoroastrian influence came in. Thus I believe that apart from the notorious conservatism and chauvinism of the Egyptian priests, the apparent continuity ofGreek views ofEgyptian religion before and after the Persian conquests makes it plausible to argue that Cumont exaggerated the extent of,Eastem' influence on the religion of early Ptolemaic Egypt, which despite foreign conquests seems to have remained fundamentally Egyptian. Nevertheless, Cumont's arguments for dating the earliest strata of the Hermetic Texts to the Persian period are reinforced in previous work by Sir Flinders Petrie, the brilliant and eccentric founder of



BLACK ATHENA
modem Egyptology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Petrie argued, from historical context, that at least some passages from the Hermetic Texts must date to the Persian period and that the crisis of Egyptian religion began in this period. He maintained that the Lament prophesying the proscription of Egyptian religion - quoted on p. 129was in circulation long before the Christian prohibition of Paganism in 390 AD, so that it could refer only to the persecutions of the Persian period. He also pointed out that the earlier date would also fit better with the references to Indians and Scythians as typical foreigners.
Other Texts refer to foreigners 'newly filling the land'; this could hardly apply to the Greek conquest, let alone the Roman one. They also mention an Egyptian king - the last ofwhom reigned between 359 and
342 BC.48
Petrie's arguments were considered outrageous by scholars who quickly realized that the whole Aryan Model was at stake. As the
Hellenist expert in Hermeticism, Professor Walter Scott, wrote in 1924: 'If these dates were proved to be right, there would necessarily result from them an astounding bouleversement ofall commonly accepted views ofthe history of Greek thought.' Thus evidence challenging the Aryan Model was not considered in detail on its own merits, but was crushed by the model itself. Petrie's arguments were ruled out of court without any need to answer them: 'But the arguments by which he endeavours to support his datings are not such as to be worth serious attention.' Finally, and with incredible impudence, Scott asserted the superiority of Classics over other lesser disciplines: 'It is to be regretted that a man who has earned a high reputation by good work in other departments
has in this case strayed into a field ofresearch in which he does not know his bearings.,49
There is no doubt at all that Petrie knew far more Greek than Scott knew Egyptian. In any event, Scott was simply making explicit the hierarchy that had been implicit since the subordination of Egyptology to Indo-European studies in the I 880s. In this case it meant that Egyptologists could have nothing to say about the Hermetic Texts because Hellenists considered them to be Greek. The supposition and the expertise claiming a monopoly were mutually reinforcing. Aside from Petrie's specific arguments, the central feature pointing
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 139
to the early dating of the oldest portion of the Texts is that all scholars agree that Hermes is the same as the Egyptian Thoth. Casaubon, the 17th-century debunker ofthe Texts, did not deny that there might have been an ancient sage called Hermes Trismegistos. Similarly, modem writers can hardly deny the existence of Thoth as the god of wisdom. What is questioned is the antiquity ofthe Texts and of the figure of the
sage Hermes Trismegistos. It is not so easy, however, to draw clear lines between the traditional worship of Thoth, his allegedly Iranian or Hellenic cult in the Hellenistic period and the philosophy of the Hermetic Texts. Professors Stricker and Derchain have recently shown in detail that the Egyptian element in the Corpus is a good deal more prominent than Festugiere and other scholars working at the height ofthe Aryan Model supposed.50 Furthermore, the idea of the 'Writings ofThoth' is clearly very old. It occurs frequently in The Book ofthe Dead, which was current in the 18th Dynasty. Father Boylan - who wrote a book on Thoth in the 1920S - mentions a 19th-dynasty reference to 'the writings of Thoth which are in the library'.51 Plutarch and the early Christian writer Clement of Alexandria refer to the 'Writings of Hermes,.52 Although
the dynastic version may bear very little resemblance to the later Corpus, I believe scholars are too hasty in their denial ofany connection with the latter. Recent discoveries have also pushed back the dates of features of the Hermetic Corpus previously thought to have come in only in the Roman period. The name Ql].wty \ \ (3 (Thoth Thrice Greatest) has been found at Esna in Upper Egypt from the early 3rd century BC, and Ql)wty p3\ p3 \ p3 <] (Thoth the Thrice Greatest), Hermes Trismegistos, has been read in Demotic texts from Saqqara just outside Memphis, from the early 2nd century BC. This text was among the documents ofa priest associated with Thoth. In another item from this collection, The Treasury ofHor, there is the tradition that Thoth was the father of Isis, which had previously been attested only in the Hermetic Texts.s3 These two links with the Hermetic Corpus have been found with other writings linking them to the so-called Hermopolitan cosmogony, with its traditional roots and association with the enormously popular cult of Thoth and his sacred bird, the ibis. It has been estimated, for instance,



BLACK ATHENA
that in anyone year there were 10,000 ibises at Saqqara.54 It is generally believed that Thoth's cult expanded greatly during Ptolemaic times but in The Book ofthe Dead, a thousand years earlier, Thoth was already an extremely powerful and often-invoked deity.55 All in all, there is no reason whatsoever to doubt that the worship of Thoth in Ptolemaic times was firmly rooted in ancient tradition.
The key reason for making a sharp break between the ancient cult and the later Hermeticism was the latter's abstract 'Platonic' philosophy. The denial that the Egyptians were capable of abstract and philosophical thought has been a linchpin for the Aryan Model and therefore carries a lot of ideological baggage. This can be the only reason why proofthat Egyptians could think in terms ofabstract religion, which was published eightyyears ago, has received so little attention. The proof comes from a text generally called Memphite Theology, which dates back to the 2nd or 3rd millennium. The Theology describes a cosmogony according to which Ptah, the local god ofMemphis, and his emanation Atum, were the primal beings. Ptah created the world in his heart, the seat ofhis mind, and actualized it through his tongue, the act ofspeech. This, though Father Festugiere and Father Boylan hasten to deny it, looks remarkably like the Platonic and Christian logos, the 'Word' which 'already was, The Word dwelt with God, and what God was, The Word was,
The Word then was with God at the beginning, and through him all things came to be ...,56
After translating and publishing the Memphite Theology the EgyptologistJames Breasted wrote:
The above conception of the world forms quite a sufficient basis for suggesting that the later notions of nous and logos, hitherto supposed to have been introduced into Egypt from abroad at a much later date, were present at this early period. Thus the Greek tradition of the origin oftheir philosophy in Egypt undoubtedly contains more ofthe truth than has in recent years been conceded.
He went on:
The habit, later so prevalent among the Greeks, of interpreting philosophically the functions and relations of the Egyptian gods ...
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 141
had already begun in Egypt before the earliest Greek philosophers were born; and it is not impossible that the Greek practice of the interpretations of their own gods received its first impulse from Egypt.57
Thoth's role in this cosmogony was as the heart ofPtah, Ptah's tongue being Horus. This tradition of linking Thoth to the heart can still be seen 2,000 years later in the Treasury ofHor. Its publisher, John Ray, rightly points out the association ofthe heart with the intellect ofwhich Thoth was particularly thought to be the master.58 In other theologies, however, Thoth was the inventor of writing, the originator of mathematics and the master of magic spells; the divine act of speech which related the gods to each other and to men, and even the creator of the world. 59
The fact that Thoth was a great communicator was a factor in the syncretism between him and Anubis·, the Jackal protector of the dead, guide to the soul and messenger of death. Still more important was the fact that Thoth and Anubis played closely intertwined roles in the trial ofthe dead. The two were closely associated in this function even in the Pyramid Texts dating from the 3rd millennium, and a syncretic image of the two deities has been found from the 19th Dynasty or 13th century Be. However, a formal cult of Hermanubis did not appear in Egyptian religion until Ptolemaic times.60 The relationship of this last development to the existence in Greek religion of Hermes, who combined the roles of Thoth and Anubis, is unclear. Nevertheless, although the original combination seems to have begun in Egypt, there seems little doubt that the Ptolemaic syncretic form derived from Greek religion. . With these multiple aspects, Hermes Trismegistos could play all the roles in the theology or 'twofold philosophy' discussed on p. 132. As father of the gods and the supreme intellect he could be the Hidden God; as activating intellect or act ofspeech he could be the demiurge; as communicator he could be the Holy Ghost linking and separating the other two. Finally, he could be the messenger or guide who leads souls to immortality and explains the wonders of the universe to them. However, the dominant later tradition made it clear that Hermes was a philosopher and moral teacher.



BLACK ATHENA
Here we encounter the question of Hermes' euhemerization, his turning from a god to a sage. Many scholars consider this euhemerization to be another late feature. But here too there are earlier precedents. Plato, in the early 4th century BC, refers to Theuth and Thot as the inventor of writing, numbers and astronomy, etc. Furthermore, TheuthiThoth both as a god and as a sage.61 Fifty years later, Hekataios of Abdera described Hermes/Thoth as a great human inventor.62 There are also strong suggestions of his early euhemerization and rationalization from Phoenicia. In the I st century AD a Phoenician, Philon of Byblos, epitomized and translated into Greek some of the works of an ancient priest, Sanchunation, who he claimed had lived before the Trojan War.63 After the foundation of Classics, in the early 19th century, Philon's writings on ancient Phoenician religion and myth were dismissed as Hellenistic fantasy. In the 1930S, however, the discovery of striking parallels between Philon's mythology and that of the Ugaritic texts from the 13th century BC led to a sharp change of opinion. Thus Semitists like William Albright and Otto Eissfeldt tended to place Sanchunation in the first halfofthe I st millennium and some of his materials as deriving from the 2nd.64 Still more recendy, Professor Baumgarten defied ancient tradition and the two greatest 20th-century authorities in the field to argue for a much later dating. This is firsdy because not everything in Philon can be explained by the Ugaritic material, and secondly because Baumgarten takes it as axiomatic that all the rational and scientific thought in Philon has Greek origins. This in turn is because he believes Classicists have proved that reason and science began in In this way, an essentially circular argument - there cannot have been any pre-Greek science or reason, .because there was no pre-Greek science or reason is used to claim that Philon's euhemerism must be Greek and late.
Here I need to draw some distinctions before proceeding. The first type ofeuhemerism, the non-personalized abstraction ofnatural forces, seems to have been present in Egyptian thought from the earliest times. It is certainly true of the cosmogony of Hermopolis, which has been linked to Thoth and to the cosmogony of Taautos described by Sanchunation.66 The abstraction is indicated by the fact that not one of
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 143
the Hermopolitan Ogdoad - the eight gods of the city of Hermopolis, the four pairs ofbeings or forces from whom the universe was created had temples or cults, though they were sometimes equated with
divinities which did.67 The second type ofeuhemerism - the turning ofgods and goddesses into mortal sages, heroes and heroines - is a worldwide phenomenon, and the widespread tradition of calling the major gods the first kings of Egypt goes back at least as far as the Turin Canon ofkings from the 13th century BC.68 In the Levant it would seem to have been associated with the rise ofmonolatry and monotheism at the tum ofthe I st millennium BC; the reason for this is simply that exclusive cults are unable to tolerate even lesser deities. In Genesis, for instance, one finds considerable euhemerism in the turning of what appear to have been deities like Enoch and Noah into patriarchs, and Genesis seems to have been written or compiled early in the 1st millennium BC. Further, scholars from Renan in the 19th century to Albright in the 20th have argued that
Phoenician religion lent itselfreadily to euhemerist analysis.69 It would therefore appear reasonable to accept - literally or metaphorically those scholars who link Euhemeros, the original euhemerizer, to Sidon and to agree with Albright and Eissfeldt when they place Sanchunation and Mochos - whose Sidonian cosmogony was preserved by the late Neo-Platonist Damaskios - before the 6th century BC.70 Sanchunation's cosmogony was ostensibly based on the lost works of Taautos. However, Taautos was also mentioned in Philon's work as a Phoenician culture hero who had invented letters.71 Elsewhere in the writings, he appears as Hermes Trismegistos - the earliest mention of the name in Greek - or as the secretary and cunning vizier ofthe divine hero Kronos, in the thoroughly euhemerized story ofthe latter's life and adventures. 72 Thoth also appears in the Bible. In the Book ofjob, which dates back to the 6th century BC or beyond, one finds the lines:
Who put wisdom into Who gave sekwi understanding?
In his authoritative commentary on Job, Professor Marvin Pope writes about this as follows:
J



144 BLACK ATHENA
J. G. E. Hoffmann was probably right in taking wwt to refer to the god Thoth himself. The consonantal orthography corresponds rather closely to the form of the name that prevailed in the 18th Dynasty (gjJwty), when the worship of Thoth was at its peak and spread to Phoenicia ... Philon of Byblos gives the Phoenician pronunciation as Taaut(os), which would reflect the form tahut . .. The suggestion of Hoffmann as to selewi, connecting it to Coptic name of the planet Mercury (soucki), seems preferable to the dubious connection with the 'cock'. The all-knowing, cleverminded Thoth-Taautos, inventor ofthe alphabet and founder of all knowledge, was identified with the Hermes-Mercury of the Greeks and Romans under the title of Hermes Trismegistos/ Tremaximus. 73
It should be emphasized that was filled with knowledge by the Lord and was therefore a sage and epitome ofwisdom, not a god. Thus unless, like Baumgarten, one takes a principled stand against any pre-Greek rationality, there would seem to be overwhelming evidence that in both Egyptian and Phoenician culture there had been euhemerization of gods into sages and heroes long before the massive Greek influence on Egypt in the 4th century BC. What is more, this is particularly true in the case ofThoth and Hermes Trismegistos. Let me reiterate my argument up to this point. Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism flourished chiefly in Egypt and among more or less Hellenized Egyptians after the collapse of institutional Egyptian religion. Whether or not there was a Hermetic btotherhood or cult from the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD, Hermetic ideas played a formative role in, and remained central to, these philosophies and heresies and their devotees. The cult of Thoth was always important in Egyptian religion but became increasingly so in the second half of the 2nd millennium. The idea of the 'writings of Thoth' is an ancient one and it is probable that such writings existed by the late 2nd millennium. However, the Hermetic Corpus, as it now survives, seems to represent Egyptian religion in crisis and to contain Iranian and Mesopotamian concepts. It is therefore unlikely that there are any texts from before the first Persian invasion in 525 BC. It is clear that the Corpus is heterogeneous and it probably
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 145
contains material written over a long period, from the 6th century BC to the 2nd century AD. Despite its relative lateness it is overwhelmingly likely that the Corpus contains many very much older and philosophical concepts and that it is fundamentally Egyptian. The Iranian and Chaldaean influences have been mentioned above. There are also undoubted Greek influences, at least on the later texts. I believe, however, that these are difficult to detect because Greek Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy was so heavily dependent on Egyptian religion and thought.
HERMETICISM AND NEO-PLATONISM
UNDER EARLY CHRISTIANITY,
JUDAISM AND ISLAM
By the end of the 4th century, Gnosticism had been largely extirpated by the orthodox Church. Pagan Ne'o-Platonism survived rather longer, but it too had disappeared before the Moslem conquest of Egypt in the 630S. The figure ofHermes Trismegistos as the epitome ofknowledge, on the other hand, survived in both Christianity and Islam. Euhemerism was now essential; asJean Seznec, the great 20th-century historian of pagan survivals in the Renaissance, has pointed out, euhemerism enjoyed 'an extraordinary revival' in early Christian times.74 As with all the descendants ofCanaanite monotheism, the Christian Church used euhemerism to diminish and tame the pagan gods at the same time as it allowed them to survive under the new religion. NeitlAthena was incorporated as St Catherine, HoruslPerseus as St George, and Anubis/Hermes as St Christopher.75 Significantly, however, ThothAnubis/Hermes remained outside the Church, as the sage and epitome ofEgyptian and Oriental wisdom Hermes Trismegistos. Hermes' relationship to Christianity was always delicately balanced, particularly on the question of priority. The 3rd-century Church Father Lactantius maintained that Hermes had lived before Moses; St Augustine, on the other hand, claimed that while Egyptian astronomy and other exact sciences had developed early, there was no moral teaching in Egypt until the time ofTrismegistos, who slightly postdated Moses and had learnt from the latter and the biblical Patriarchs. Here,



BLACK ATHENA
as in so' many other areas, Augustine set out the orthodoxy that was to last until the 18th century: that biblical knowledge came before _ in both priority and importance - Hermetic Egyptian knowledge, but that
the latter was the source of all 'Gentile' wisdom and specifically that of the Greeks.76
In Islam, Hermes Trismegistos was euhemerized and identified with Idris, a sincere prophet who appears in the Qoran. In this tradition, too, he was seen as the 'father of philosophers' and 'the one who is thrice endowed with wisdom'. In other Islamic traditions he was seen as three sages, one from before the Flood who lived in Egypt and twoJrom after it; one from Babylon and the other again from Egypt. He was seen as the culture hero who had invented all the arts and sciences, especially astronomy, astrology, medicine and magic. Further, although it is plausibly argued that his - or Egyptian - influence in early Islam was largely in these areas, there was an early Islamic philosophical Hermeticism which has not been deeply studied, partly no doubt because of the extreme impenetrability ofthe texts.77
The huge Islamic conquests from Persia to Spain ofthe 7th and 8th centuries brought great prominence and prosperity to theJews. Despite its powerful spirit of rationality and equality, Jewish religion had both esoteric cults and a 'twofold philosophy' even before the beginning of Christianity. The Essenes and other sectaries living in the Judaean Desert from the 2nd century Be were convinced that truths had been revealed to them that were unknown to the priests in Jerusalem and to the ordinary people; we know, for instance, that they used the Book of Enoch and other apocalyptic writings. Concerned with astrology and other methods of prediction, they also seem to have shared the mysticism - attested more fully at a later time - around the images ofthe Throne of God and the Chariot by which Elijah and the mystic could ascend into heaven. 78 The undoubted relationship between these sects and Christianity has been and will be endlessly debated, but less attention has been paid to the parallels and possible causal relations between the Jewish sects' tendencies towards celibacy, communism and desert life and those ofearly Christian monasticism as it grew up in the Egyptian desert. 79 The two groups certainly shared a common populism, Messianism and tendency to violence.
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 147
A much closer parallel to the thinking of the upper-class Hermeticists and Neo-Platonists can be seen in the massive works of Philon of Alexandria. In Philon's wealthy, Egyptian, Hellenized Jewish circle of the I st century AD there was a desire to syncretize the wisdom ofthe Old Testament with Platonic-Egyptian thought through allegorical, esoteric and mystical interpretation. Philon even mentioned the existence of a sectarian community of 'Worshippers of God,.8o Philon himself remained an important figure in the development of Middle and Neo-Platonic thought, and his mixture of Platonism and Judaism has fascinating resonances with that in Christianity. However, the rich, cultivated, Hellenized Jewry he represented was destroyed for ever by the genocide of the Jews within the Eastern Roman Empire in the suppression oftheir rising of I 16 AD. Even though Philon died before the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 AD, his life in the Diaspora was essentially one of the synagogue and thus resembled that oflaterJewry. Even in this prosaic, democratic, Pharasaic rabbinic society there were esoteric and mystical tendencies in the early centuries of the Common Era which Professor Gershom Scholem called 'Jewish Gnosticism'. In the writings of these tendencies one finds such specifically Jewish concerns as the Throne and the Chariot and the mystical and numerological significance ofthe letters of the Hebrew alphabet or the biblical text. Most of the key elements in Hermeticism, Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism are also contained: the concept of man as the measure of all things, the eight spheres or firmaments which can be transcended, and tendencies towards magic.8]
Mysticism is also attested in Judaism in the 8th and lOth centuries. For instance, a Karaite or Jewish sectarian purist in the lOth century was familiar with quotations from Philon. Professor Scholem, however, warned that
it should not be deduced from this that there was a continuous influence up to this time, let alone up to the time of the formulation of the Kabbalah in the Middle Ages. Specific parallels between Philonic and Kabbalistic exegesis should be put down to the similarity of their exegetical method, which naturally produced identical results from time to time.82



BLACK ATHENA
Here, he has raised a general issue that will occur again in this chapter: the possibility ofthe survival and continuity of secretive mystic sects in the face ofgeneral hostility and specific persecution over long periods of time. On the one hand, such groups leave little trace even when they are flourishing; on the other, as Scholem argued, they often use the same texts and similar exegetical techniques. Thus there is often a strong case for independent invention. In this case, the argument for independent invention seems rather extreme. Further, given the transmission of so much else in Jewish culture - not only orthodox religion but also folklore - over these centuries, I see no reason to doubt that there were continuous traditions ofmysticism. Scholem himself traces a development ofJewish mysticism from Egypt and Palestine to Babylonia in the 8th and 9th centuries, back to the Mediterranean in Egypt and Italy in the lOth, and in the German Hasidism in the 11th and 12th.83 We must continue this sketch of the history of the Kabbalah here because it became closely intertwined with Hermeticism during the Renaissance. Much ofthe Kabbalistic mysticism ofProvence and Spain in the 12th and 13th centuries can be explained in terms ofthe survival of Hermeticism and its descendants in Christianity and Islam; new developments in these cultures; the peculiar situation ofCatalonia and Languedoc; the intensity of persecution experienced by Jews in this period and, as Professor Scholem argued, a mystical reading of the same texts in a period of crisis. During the 12th and 13th centuries Languedoc was in a state of creative turmoil, having been for a rich and cultivated society on the border of Christianity and Islam and, within Judaism, the conjunction of the Sephardic Jews who lived under Islam with the Ashkenazim from Christian Europe. The inhabitants of Languedoc were able to have a certain objectivity about and transcendence of specific forms ofreligion. This goes some way to explain why the region should have seen the crystallization of the most radical heresy in European Christendom, that of the Albigensians or Cathars. It was a heresy in which there were two classes of faithful: the ordinary Credentes (believers) and the Perfecti. The Perfecti detached themselves from daily life in the material world for spiritual contemplation, while their ideal was a complete separation from matter and a fast to
IeH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 149
death. The struggle to preserve Catharism became associated with that of the region to preserve itself from domination by Northern France and the kings in Paris, who claimed to be champions ofCatholicism and justified their extension of central power as crusades against the heretics. Nevertheless there is no doubt that there was a great popular attachment to Catharism and to the Perfecti, whose spirituality was felt
to benefit the whole community.84 Although clearly a religion oftwo tiers, and sharing some beliefs with the mystical traditions I have discussed above - such as the transmigration ofsouls - Catharism was much more sharply dualist in a way that is conventionally seen to be Iranian, Zoroastrian or Manichaean. The forces of God and Satan, good and evil, spirit and flesh are cosmic and seen to be equally balanced and in constant conflict. This was very different from the pantheist and anthropocentric vision ofthe Hermetic traditions.8s Nevertheless, though both movements existed all over Europe, the flourishing of Albigensianism and Kabbalism in Languedoc and Provence at the same time is striking, and indicates something extraordinary about the social and cultural milieu. It is difficult to believe that the two did not influence each other, and this would seem to be particularly true in social structure. Just as the Perfecti' were supported and protected with fierce devotion by the Credentes, the mystical Kabbalist rabbis seem to have been maintained by their communities for the spiritual benefits their holiness brought to them. However, where the Cathars were ruthlessly exterminated by the Catholic French, the enemies of the Kabbalists in Jewry lacked these means and the movement spread into Spain, where it flourished as an esoteric but relatively respectable element in Spanish Judaism until Ferdinand and Isabella's Expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. Kabbalah is explicitly esoteric - indeed, its study has been generally restricted to good, learned (male) Jews over forty. It rejects both the historicism of the common 'superficial' reading of the Bible and the rationality oforthodoxy in favour ofan 'inner' reading ofthe text which is supposed to reveal a mystic cosmic struggle for the good Jews to reconstitute the primeval light shattered at the moment of creation. In many ways Kabbalism is an extension of the Orthodox approach: the mystery is approached through intense study and



II
BLACK ATHENA
includes such things as the significance and numerology of the letters of the Bible. But it goes beyond such things into contemplation of the Throne, the Chariot and above all, the Name ofGod, all ofwhich leads to ecstasy. Kabbalah also contains all the key forms we have seen in Hermeticism and its descendants: trinities, the concepts of the 'absconded' or Hidden God or intellect, the activating logos or word and mediating spirit; the eight spheres or firmaments and their transcendence by the well-trained mystic; and man is seen as the measure of all things and sometimes even as the maker ofGod. In the first centuries of its existence, this led to astrology, medicine and magic, for all ofwhich Jews were renowned throughout Medieval Europe.86
HERMETICISM IN BYZANTIUM
AND CHRISTIAN WESTERN EUROPE
Neo-Platonism, of at least a nominally Christian kind, seems to have survived in the Byzantine Empire, and this was renewed in what has been called the 11th-century Renaissance there. Its leading Neo-Platonic figure, Psellos, was clearly interested in both Hermetic
philosophy and magic. The 20th-century scholar Professor Zervos has written:
We do not know how many works Psellos composed on Hermetic literature. The only one that remains is a gloss on the 'Poimandres' ... After maintaining the influence of 'Genesis' on the formation of the cosmogonic doctrines of the 'Poimandres', Psellos affirms that all Hellenic conceptions of God are influenced by Eastern models. He justifies this superiority of the East over Greek philosophy by pointing out that Porphery [the Neo-Platonist ofthe 3rd century AD] had gone to an Egyptian priest, Anebon, in order to receive instruction on the first cause.87
Here, as with Augustine, one sees the hierarchy - the Bible, Egyptian and Oriental wisdom, and Greece, with interest focused on the second. The fact that some of Psellos' works were taken to Italy in the 15th century means that they had been preserved throughout the troubles of the last 400 years of the Byzantine Empire at Constantinople.
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION IS I
This, in tum, shows the importance with which Neo-Platonism and Hermeticism were treated there. The beliefin Egypt as a powerful, ifnot the most powerful, centre of magic survived the conversion ofWestern Europe to Christianity. Both scarabs and a barbaric head of a bull with a solar disc on his forehead, which has been identified with Apis, were found in the pagan tomb of Childeric - the father ofClovis, the first Christian king ofFrance - who died in 48 1.88 Three hundred or so years later the great seal of Charlemagne represented the head of the late Egyptian Jupiter Serapis.89 Although -like every other cultural at this period - interest in the Hermetic Texts was at a low ebb during the Dark and Early Middle Ages, it did not die out completely. However, there is little doubt that medieval thinkers were more interested in Hermetic magic and astrology than in its philosophy. Nevertheless, one philosophic text, Asclepius, had remained in circulation ever since its translation into Latin in the 2nd century.90 The number of copies of that text made in the 11th and 12th centuries indicates that interest in it seems to have increased in what has been called the 12th-century Renaissance of Western Europe.91 It is also difficult to believe that the increase of humanism in the centuries that followed was not influenced byAsclepius and the few Neo-Platonic texts available.
EGYPT IN THE RENAISSANCE
EarlY-20th-century historians tended to picture the Renaissance as Greek and, though influenced by Plato, as somehow 'pure' until the late 15th century and the introduction of Neo-Platonism.92 However, the concern with Egypt and the Orient was integral to the whole movement from the beginning. It cannot be emphasized enough that, just as to Shakespeare the Ancient Greeks were quarrelsome Levantines, not demigods, the Italian Renaissance scholars, artists and patrons identified themselves with Greeks but were not centrally concerned with the Greece of Homer or Perikles, or even with the Olympian gods. They were interested in picking up from pagan Antiquity where it had left off. As the philosopher and historian David Hume wrote, with 18th



BLACK ATHENA
century sensibility, 'Learning, on its revival, was attired in the same
unnatural garb which it wore at the time ofits decay among the Greeks and Romans.,93
Central to this 'decadence' was a respect for Egypt and the East, an admiration for the 'Oriental' profusion and obscurity of the NeoPlatonists' writings, and a passion for Egyptian and Oriental mystery. However, it is precisely from the Neo-Platonic and Hermetic traditions that the Renaissance drew its most characteristic vision of the infinite potential of man, and the belief that man is the measure of all things. Even in what the 19th- and 20th-century historians have seen as the
'manly' 14th and early 15th centuries, there was an enormous respect for the Egyptians.
By the beginning ofthe 15th century, Italian scholars had a good idea ofthe centrality ofEgypt and the Hermetic Texts to the ancient learning they wished to revive. Scholars had long known about and read AscJepius, and Arabic Hermetic Texts were being translated into Latin. Furthermore, with the increase in contact between Italy and Greece, the Neo-Platonic and Hermetic writings of PselIos and the other promoters ofthe Byzantine Renaissance became available.94 In 1419 a copy of Hierog/yphika, a late-5th-century work on hieroglyphics by Horapollo, an Upper Egyptian, was brought to Italy and translated.95 The author had combined a correct interpretation ofa number ofsigns 'with the most grotesque allegorical reasons for those meanings'.96 The work was enormously popular and confirmed the belief that hieroglyphics was the script of the mystertes, superior to alphabets because one sign was seen to compress rich meaning within it and to be unencumbered with the phonetics of mundane speech. In general, hieroglyphs and the enigmas they were supposed to contain became enormously important in the early 15th century; see, for instance, the famous medal of the explicitly Egyptian winged eye made by the great painter, architect and theorist of art Leone Battista Alberti, who is
sometimes regarded as a representatative ofthe 'uncontaminated' early Renaissance. 97
The Egyptian priests' use of hieroglyphs was perceived as being linked to their use of allegories and the allegorical significance of the mysteries attributed to them by Plutarch and other Greek writers. As we
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 153
have seen, I 9th- and 20th-century scholars insist that the Greeks 'got it wrong'. They believe that the Renaissance thinkers were equally mistaken. As the earlY-20th-century art historian Professor Wind wrote about a number of the latter:
their concern was less with the original mystery cults than with their philosophical adaptation. Good judgement alone did not impose the restriction; it was largely a case of good luck, for it derived from a historical misconception: they assumed that the figurative interpretation was part ()f the original mysteries.98
. I believe that the 15th-century interpretation was accurate, at least for late Egyptian religion. In any event, its truth was never questioned by the Italians ofthe Renaissance. The Renaissance passion for Egypt came firstly from its ancient reputation of having been the place where the mysteries and sacred initiations were first established. Furthermore, with the possible exceptions Qf the Persian Zoroastrians and the Chaldaeans, of whom there was only a dim conception, the Egyptians were seen as the origin of all wisdom and arts; for all the sense of progress attributed to them by Romantic historians, Renaissance men and women were fundamentally interested in the past. They were searching forJontes or 'sources' - and so they looked behind Christianity to pagan Rome, behind Rome to Greece; but behind Greece there was Egypt, as Giordano Bruno put it in the following century: 'We Greeks own Egypt, the grand monarchy of letters and nobility, to be the parent of our fables, metaphors and doctrines. ,99
However, lest it be thought that Bruno was atypical, or belonged to a generation that had been 'corrupted' by revived Neo-Platonism, let me quote Frances Yates on the foundation ofthe new Neo-Platonic school which necessarily reflects attitudes towards Egypt and Greece from before this took place:
About 1460, a Greek manuscript was brought to Florence from Macedonia by a monk, one of those many agents employed by Cosimo de' Medici to collect manuscripts for him. It contained a copy of the Corpus Hermeticum ... Though the Plato Manuscripts



154 BLACK ATHENA
were already assembled, awaiting translation, Cosimo ordered Ficino to put these aside and to translate the work of Hermes Trismegistos at once, before embarking on the Greek philosophers . .. Egypt was before Greece; Hermes was earlier than Plato. Renaissance respect for the old ... as nearest to the divine truth
demanded that the Corpus Hermeticum be translated before Plato's Republic or Symposion ... 100
The new translations were used as the centrepiece for the revived Platonic Academy established by the great translator, scholar and philosopher Marsilio Ficino in his villa at Carregio outside Florence. The same was true of the other academies that sprang up in all the major Italian cities, and later throughout Europe. Although these academies were consciously modelled on Plato's own in Athens, their members believed that this had been constructed on the model of an ideal priesthood in Egyptian temples. All European academies have had the election ofnew members as a central raison d'are. In the academy of 15th- and 16th-century Rome, for instance, such elections were full of ritual paraphernalia. 101 The rituals of elevation to the rank of'immor
tals' practised in the French Academy and elsewhere can be traced back to the mysteries and sacred initiations giving immortality concocted in the Renaissance on the basis of reports from Late Antiquity and believed - in my opinion rightly - to have derived ultimately from Ancient Egypt. 102 Moreover, the Renaissance scholars took much more than their organization from the Neo-Platonists. They looked beyond them to Plato himself, Pythagoras, Orpheus and Egypt for their philosophy, science and magic.
In the late 15th century the Neo-Platonic thought was merged with that of the Kabbalah by the Renaissance thinker and mystic Pico della Mirandola. Pico's 'spiritual magic' was able to use the two systems in a way that could even sustain Christianity on a mystical basis of Egyptian hieroglyphics and Hebrew letters and numbers. 103 Pico had an enormous influence at the time, particularly on the Borgias, who commissioned works of art glorifying Egyptian religion and especially the Apis bull, whom they took to be their symbol. Much more important in the long run, however, was Pico's clear articulation ofthe Egyptian position
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 155
that man as a 'magus' could, as Frances Yates put it: 'use ... both Magia and Kabbalah to act upon the world, to control his destiny by science.'1M
This and similar fusions of the Jewish and Egyptian traditions which, as mentioned above, were related to each other - appeared again at the tum of the 16th century, notably in the work of the Renaissance
philosopher Tommaso Campanella. Kabbalism, too, continued to be a . . . . c 6th d th . d ' 105
major mSpIratlOn lor 1 - an 17 -century magtc an SCIence. Nevertheless, as Frances Yates has pointed out, Kabbalah was never called a prisca theologia, an ancient or primary theology, on the grounds that it belonged to the biblical and not the Gentile tradition. Thus, Renaissance thinkers who wished to transcend Christianity had no alternative to Egypt. 106
COPERNICUS AND HERMETICISM
Frances Yates, in tune with recent writing on Copernicus, claimed in
1964 that
Copernicus is not living within the world-view of Thomas Aquinas but within that ofthe new Neo-Platonism, ofthe Prisci Theologi, with Hermes Trismegistos at their head, of Ficino. One can say, either that the intense emphasis on the sun in this new world-view was the emotional driving force which induced Copernicus to undertake his mathematical calculations on the hypothesis that the sun is indeed at the centre ofthe planetary system; or that he wished to make his discovery acceptable by presenting it within the framework of this new attitude. Perhaps both explanations would be true, or some ofeach. t07
Although, as I have said, the Hermetic Texts tend to work within the geocentral Ptolemaic system, in some texts, heliocentric cosmologies are invisioned. Furthermore, there are repeated references to the special sanctity of the sun seen as the source of light and sometimes as the second god which governs the third god, the animate world and all its living creatures.108 Thus the Texts shared the Ancient Egyptian focus on the sun as the chief divinity and life-giving force.



BLACK ATHENA
A great deal has happened in Copernican studies since Frances Yates wrote the text cited above, and there have been attempts to mitigate her upsetting suggestion. Some objections, like those of the historian of science Professor Rosen, have continued to follow the conventional picture of the development of science as a succession of great men's heroic leaps from darkness into light. Hence, for Rosen, Copernicus
was 'neither a Platonist nor a Neo-Platonist, nor an Aristotelian, he was
C . ,109 M " f i
a opermcan. ore Slgru cantly, a number ofrecent scholars have shown that Copernicus' mathematical modelling was very largely based on Islamic sources, notably the works of NasIr ad-Din at-TusI in the
'. .
13th century and Ibn ash Shatir in the 14th.l10 These, however, do not include heliocentricity itself, the idea of which came to Copernicus considerably before his mathematical proofofit. It has been argued that Copernicus derived his heliocentricity from the mid-15th-century scholar Regiomontanus. The technical arguments concerned do not diminish the fact that Regiomontanus' opening of the possibility of heliocentricity may well have derived from his being in the thick of
mid- 15th-century Platonism. Whether or not this is the case, Professor Yates' claim would still seem to hold true. III
HERMETICISM AND EGYPT
IN THE 16TH CENTURY
It is generally implied that once the Texts were read, a disillusion set in.
This is belied by the bibliographical facts that, as Professor Blanco has put it,
Between 1471 and 1641 Marsilio Ficino's translation went through 25 editions; that ofPatritius went through six; the bilingual edition of Fr De Foix appeared twice; the 'Asclepius' was edited forty times; the commentary of]. Faber Stapulensis on the 'Pimander' appeared in fourteen editions; that of Rosellius in six; the commentary ofJ.
Faber Stapulensis on the 'Asclepius' passed through eleven editions
etc. liZ ,
Bibliography also tells us something about relative concern with Greece and Egypt. For example, George Eliot, at the height of
[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 157
Victorian Romanticism, vividly pictured a Renaissance concern with the ruins of pagan Athens. 1l3 But this is an anachronism. West Europeans from the 15th to the 17th century were far more concerned with travels in Egypt than they were with those in Greece: the editors of a recent collection of reprints maintain that, between 1400 and 1700, there were over 250 descriptions of Egypt by Western travellers. 1l4 In some circles, in fact, having travelled to the sources of knowledge in Egypt provided a legitimacy for attacks on conventional wisdom. The clearest example of this in the early 16th century was the great and original doctor and mining engineer Paracelsus, who claimed probably falsely - to have been to Egypt and called his medicine Hermetic. However, he was only near the beginning of a tradition which continued up to and included Newton, in which scientists justified turning to experiment as a way to retrieve the wisdom of Egypt and the Orient which the Greeks and Romans had failed to preserve. 115
We have to remember that for the last hundred and fifty years the Renaissance has been seen as one of the twin peaks of European culture, only slightly less elevated than 5th-century Athens. Consequently, 19th- and 20th-century scholars have experienced considerable difficulty and distress in dealing with the Renaissance admiration for Egypt and the Orient. For instance, although the gods were referred to by their Latin names, they were believed to be fundamentally Egyptian. TakeJean Seznec, the leading 20th-century scholar on pagan survivals in Antiquity, writing about the illustrated manuals ofthe pagan gods:
But in our manuals [books of illustrations] divinities of the Oriental cults are given extraordinary prominence, especially in Cartari. First of all the Egyptians ... we have already had occasion to note in Picator the same unusual or even disproportionate place given to Oriental divinities; it is due, in our opinion, to a contemporary influence - that of the 'hieroglyphics' which drew the attention of humanists to Egypt and to the Orient in general. 116



BLACK ATHENA
Later on:
Our manuals, in their manifest preference for the Eastern rather than Olympic divinities - a preference furthered by the contemEgyptomania and the taste for enigmas ... As for Mercury, he IS a sort of magus capped with a pointed bonnet. Small winged beings, who seem to emerge from a well, grasp a stalk of his enormous Caduceus, about which are entwined four serpents; other similar puttini seem to slip and fall back. What is this figure, which belongs, as Yriarte remarks, to neither Rome, Greece, Assyria nor Persia? It is reminiscent at once ofHermes, the guide ofsouls to the underworld, or psychopompos and ofthe Egyptian Thoth who teaches the soul to raise itselfby degrees to a knowledge of divine things. I 17
It is not only the conventional historians who prefer to distance themselves from this 'unfortunate' aspect of the Renaissance. Frances Yates, who not only opened up but still towers over the study of Renaissance Hermeticism and championed heresies ofall sorts, did not challenge the full force of the Aryan Model. While detailing the enormous and fruitful impact of Egyptian Hermeticism on 15th- and 16th-century Italy, she seems to have felt it necessary to reassure her readers that she was not so unorthodox as to believe the men she was writing about with such sympathy. There are frequent remarks of the type: 'This huge historical error was to have amazingresults.,118 I think this is, in fact, far more appropriate as a description ofthe Aryan Model! There is no doubt that in the 16th century Hermeticism and concern with Egypt flourished as a respectable part ofhigh Renaissance culture. In the view of later history, however, Hermeticism's most important pr.oduct of the period was an exception, Copernicus' great champion, GIordano Bruno. Bruno was acclaimed by 19th- and earlY-20thcentury historians of science as a pioneer and martyr for science and of intellectual enquiry, but Frances Yates has firmly situated hIm III the Hermetic tradition. Bruno was remarkable in that he went further than any of his predecessors or contemporaries. For all their enthusiasm, most early Hermeticists honestly or dishonestly kept within Christianity and the bounds set by St Augustine that Egyptian and its derived Gentile philosophies were later than, and inferior to,
,

[CH. II] EGYPTIAN WISDOM AND GREEK TRANSMISSION 159
biblical wisdom. Bruno, however, went beyond not only Christianity but Judaism to reach Egypto-Paganism:
Do not suppose that the sufficiency of the Chaldaic magic derived from the Kabbalah of the Jews; for the Jews are without doubt the excrement of Egypt, and no one could ever pretend with any degree of probability that the Egyptians borrowed any principle, good or bad, from the Hebrews. Whence we Greeks [by which he seems to mean Gentiles] own Egypt, the grand monarchy of letters and nobility, to be the parent of our fables, metaphors and doctrines.119
The social context of such radicalism was the failure of the CounterReformation in the 1570S to overcome the limitations of Catholicism and heal the breach within Western Christianity, and the wars of religion which racked late-16th-century Europe. Bruno tried to attach himselfto politically moderate and relatively tolerant rulers who wanted compromise. Paradoxically, this went with his extreme intellectual and theological radicalism. Thus, to bring spiritual and physical peace, Bruno saw it as necessary to transcend Christianity not merely intellectually but politically. As Frances Yates put it: 'Bruno's Hermeticism becomes purely "Egyptian", with the Hermetic Egyptian religion not just as the prisca theologia foreshadowing Christianity but actually as the true religion.,120
The fact that Bruno had gone beyond the bounds of Christianity and was burnt at the stake for his beliefs by the Inquisition should not lead one to exaggerate his eccentricity in 16th-century Italy. Given the passion for fontes (sources) and the beliefthat priority is superiority, it is not such a great leap from saying that Hermeticism preceded Christianity to claiming that it transcended it. Nevertheless, while the balance between the Bible and Christianity, on the one hand, and Egypt and the Hermetic Texts, on the other, was fine and delicately shifting, the relation between the latter and Ancient Greece was more clear-cut. Erasmus' scepticism about the date ofthe Hermetic Texts, for instance, seems to have been based on a desire to protect Christianity rather than to assert the priority of Greece. 12l After the Reformation, the Calvinist Lambert Daneau even used the reputation ofthe Egyptians as teachers ofthe Greeks to pruve the superiority ofMoses and the biblical tradition

160 BLACK ATHENA
in 'natural philosophy', which was more or less what has later been described as 'science'. Quoting ancient sources, Daneau was able to establish the tradition that the Egyptians had learnt astronomy from the 'Syrians'. He was also able to show that the latter had had a learned man called Moschos, whom he then claimed to be Moses. Thus Moses had taught the Egyptians, and hence the Greeks, astronomy. The tradition of identifYing Moses with Moschos continued well into the 18th century. 122 Thus there was no question at this stage of challenging the Egyptian superiority oflearning over the Greeks. To conclude this chapter with a familiar example. Shakespeare's portrayal of the Greeks in Tro;lus and Cressida as unreliable and scheming was firmly based in late medieval tradition and was not atypical in his own day. As I have tried to show in this chapter, most Renaissance thinkers believed that Egypt was the original and creative source and Greece the later transmitter of some part of the Egyptian and Oriental wisdom, and the veracity ofthe Ancient Model was not at issue.
CHAPTER III
THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT IN
THE 17TH AND 18TH CENTURIES
I
N THIS CHAPTER I shall be looking at the continuation of Hermeticism in the 17th century. While most modem scholars have maintained that the Hermetic Corpus was discredited by Casaubon's textual criticism, I believe that this had very little effect on its reputation. In the short run the texts continued to be believed, and their eclipse in the 18th century was the result ofthe general intellectual shift away from magic rather than of any specific criticism. Furthermore, loss of interest in Hermeticism did not mean any diminution in respect for Egypt. At the end ofthe 17th century Ancient Egypt became associated with the 'Radical Enlightenment' and was used to subvert Christianity and the political status quo. The image of Egypt remained central to the Freemasons, who dominated intellectual life in the 18th century. Thus Egypt - often linked with the other great long-lived empire, China - maintained a high reputation for its philosophy and science, but above all for its political system, until the break-up of European political and intellectual order in the 1780s
and 90S.



BLACK ATHENA
HERMETICISM IN THE
17TH CENTURY
Giordano Bruno was burnt alive in Rome in 1600. His death, however, had a less significant long-term effect on Hermeticism than the work of Isaac Casaubon, the moderate Protestant scholar who attacked the antiquity of the Hermetic Texts in 1614. The surprising feature of Casaubon's work, for Frances Yates, was that the scholarly techniques oftextual criticism which had been available since the late 15th century should have been applied so late to the Hermetic Texts. But given the necessary selectivity of the application of such techniques and the political and ideological uses to which they have later been put, I am not so surprised that at the end of the 16th century the threat posed by the Texts, not merely to Catholicism but to Christianity as a whole, should have encouraged a scholar to scrutinize them in a hostile way. 1 Casaubon demonstrated the philosophical, theological and even textual similarities between the Hermetic Texts, the works ofPlato and passages from the New Testament. He argued that the Egyptian texts must be derivative, firstly because there were no references to the texts in the Bible or in Plato, Aristotle or other ancient writers; and secondly because the texts referred to late institutions and cited Hellenistic authors.2 Casaubon's attack is devastating against its target, the picture of the Corpus as the work of one man writing over a thousand years before the Christian era. Yet Casaubon's scholarly and ideological descendants have not answered the objections made by Ralph Cudworth in the 1670S, that the presence of later material does not make the Texts valueless as sources for Egyptian wisdom because they
were written 'before the Paganism and their succession of
. . ,3
pnests were yet extmct . Still less have the modern followers of Casaubon addressed themselves to the scheme set out by Flinders Petrie, who argued on specific historical grounds that the Texts form a relatively heterogeneous collection written between the 6th and 2nd centuries BC.4 Furthermore, the undeniable similarities between the Hermetic Texts, the works of Plato, and the 'Platonic' sections of the New Testament can easily be explained in terms of a common descent from Late Egyptian religion
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
and the Phoenician, Mesopotamian, Iranian and Greek ideas current throughout the East Mediterranean during this period. The reference to Erasmus at the end of the last chapter (see p. 159) shows that Casaubon's 'Christian Humanist' attack on the idea of Hermeticism as a source of Christianity was not altogether new. Nevertheless, the story of Casaubon's revelation is a perfect philological counterpart to the I 9th- and earlY-20th-century myth ofthe history of science already mentioned: the heroic and lonely scientific genius standing out beyond his age to turn the darkness ofsuperstition into the
light of science and reason. Unfortunately for this example, however, Hermeticism and the passion for Egypt continued to flourish throughout the 17th century. Moreover, Frances Yates reflected the confusion between myth and reality when she wrote: 'It shattered at one blow ...' but in the following paragraph continued: 'Casaubon's bombshell did not immediately take effect.' A little later she modified the impact still further by stating:
Though other factors were working against the Renaissance traditions in the 17th century, Casaubon's discovery must, I think, be reckoned as one of the factors, and an important one, in releasing 17th-century thinkers from magic.s
It is true that the early-17th-century philosopher and mathematician Marin Mersenne used Casaubon's dating to attack the Hermetic mysticism of the Elizabethan magician Robert Fludd, but it is hard to argue that this textual criticism had a major impact on society as a whole.6 It would seem more plausible, and put the horse before the cart, to say that beliefin magic dwindled towards the end ofthe 17th century for large-scale social, economic, political and religious reasons; that this decline was a factor in the gradual loss ofinterest in the Hermetic Texts; and that to the extent that it did decline, belief in their great antiquity became a victim ofthe general increase of scepticism. Whether or not Casaubon's criticism had an impact on 17th-century thought as a whole, it had no effect whatsoever on Hermeticism in that century. Some scholars, like Kircher, ignored Casaubon altogether; others, like the Cambridge Platonists, confronted his criticism but argued that the Texts still contained ancient and valuable material.



BLACK ATHENA
The purpose of Bruno's immolation was to preserve the Church from a direct challenge. Catholic interest in Egypt was too powerful to be stifled and Ancient Egypt became the obsession of one of the most influential intellectual and cultural figures in 17th-century Rome: the GermanJesuit Athanasius Kircher. Kircher was a Christian Hermeti
cist concerned with such things as astrology Pythagorean harmonics
7'
and Kabbalah. He had no doubt about the great antiquity of Hermes Trismegistos, believing that he lived about the time ofAbraham, and he
was perfectly willing to accept Egyptian prefigurations of Christ. As he wrote:
Hermes Trismegistos, the Egyptian, who first instituted hieroglyphs, thus becoming the prince and parent of all Egyptian theology and philosophy, was the first and most ancient among the Egyptians ... Thence, Orpheus, Mousaios, Linos, Pythagoras, Plato, Eudoxos, Parmenides, Melissos, Homer, Euripides and others learned rightly ofGod and of divine things ...8
well as being interested in Egypt as the place of the prisca the%gia, Kircher was concerned with it as the home of the prisca sapientia, the 'original wisdom' or 'philosophy', most ofwhich the Greeks had failed to preserve. He corresponded with Galileo on the subject ofa universal standard of measure which would naturally be that of the Egyptians, and used his powerful position at the papacy to send his agents to Egypt to determine it from the of the Great Pyramid.9 His greatest effort - to which he devoted his whole life and his extraordinary linguistic talents - was the attempt to unlock the secrets of hieroglyphics, which he saw not merely as the repository of ancient wisdom but as the ideal script. Following Horapollo, Kircher believed the hieroglyphs to be purely symbolic and therefore vastly superior to all Although unsuccessful in his attempt to decipher Egyptian IDscnptlons, he realized that Coptic was a descendant of the ancient language and might - despite the script's supposed lack of phonetic - provide help in the decipherment. Therefore, just the POIDt. when Coptic was dying out as a spoken language
ID Egypt, Kircher established its study in Rome on a systematic
basis. lO
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
ROSICRUCIANISM:
ANCIENT EGYPT
IN PROTESTANT COUNTRIES
Protestants, too, continued to be interested in Egypt and Hermeticism. The elusive Rosicrucians, who sprang up in Germany, France and England in the 17th century, seem, like Bruno - to whom they may well have been connected - to have been promoting a 'true' religion for the elite. It appears to have been designed to avoid the bloody hostility between Catholics and Protestants that erupted so horribly in the Thirty Years War that ravaged Germany from 1618 to 1648.11 Like the 16th-century Hermeticists, the Rosicrucians, or those who claimed to speak for them, advocated the direction of society by an elite of enlightened men in possession of true, magical and scientific knowledge. In doing this they were following the now familiar succession from the Egyptian priesthoods to the Pythagorean brotherhoods to the Platonic Academy. In this respect Frances Yates makes the plausible claim that it was this Rosicrucian concept that lay behind the 'invisible college' seen by the founders of the Royal Society in England in the 1650s.12
With the Commonwealth's freedom of the press, the 1650S saw a striking revival ofinterest in Hermeticism. As the historian Christopher Hill has written: 'More Paracelsan and mystical chemical books were published in the 1650S than in the whole ofthe preceding century.'13 In attacking the linked church and academic establishment, English Hermeticism became allied to political and religious radicalism. 14 With the Restoration in 1660, however, many thinkers were swept up by the counter-revolutionary current and backed away from their radicalism. What is more, the king prudently took over science by becoming patron of the Royal Society, much as he was head of the established Church. Nevertheless, the Hermetic ferment during the Commonwealth provided an important impetus for the later advances ofrespectable science. Hermeticism now tended to be associated with a special form of millenarianism that grew up in 17th-century England, focused on the need to perfect or recover all knowledge; this was seen as a necessary precondition for the advent ofthe new millennium.IS



166 BLACK ATHENA
The Cambridge Platonists, centred round Henry More and Ralph Cudworth, also came from this Hermetic and millenarian environ
ment. 16 As mentioned above, this group, which flourished from the 1660s to the 1680s, knew all about Casaubon's criticism but still maintained that the Hermetic Texts were valuable because they contained elements of the prisca sapientia. Since they saw no reason to attribute the 'Platonic' aspects of Hermeticism to Greece, for them the essential function of the Greeks was as partial transmitters of ancient wisdom. As More wrote:
Plato's school ... well agrees with learned Pythagore, Egyptian Trismegiste, and th'antique roll, Of Chaldee wisdome, all which time hath tore, But Plato and deep Plotin do restore. 17
By far the best-known pupil of the Cambridge Platonists was Isaac Newton, although the degree to which he can usefully be considered Hermeticist continues to be fiercely debated. 18 There is no doubt, however, that he too was, as the modern intellectual historian Frank Manuel puts it, 'unruffled by Isaac Casaubon's revelation,.19
Furthermore, whether or not he accepted a Hermetic prisca the%gia, he certainly believed in an Egyptian prisca sapientia, which he saw it as his mission to retrieve. For example, it essential for Newton's theory ofgravitation to have an accurate measurement ofthe circumference ofthe world. As far as he knew, there had been no recent, accurate measurement of a degree of latitude. Thus he could rely only on the figures of the Hellenistic mathematician and astronomer Eratosthenes and his followers, and these did not fit Newton's theory. His next assumption was that although Eratosthenes had lived in Egypt he had failed to preserve the ancient measurements accurately. Therefore Newton needed to retrieve the exact length of the original Egyptian cubit, from which he could calculate that of their stadium which, according to Classical authors, bore a relation to a geographical degree. Earlier in the I 7th century Burattini, an Italian working for Kircher, and John Greaves, an English scholar with similar preoccupations, had spent years trying to obain accurate measurements of the Great Pyramid. (From ancient times, it had been believed - quite possibly
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
rightly - that the Pyramid enshrined perfect units of length, area and volume as well as geometric proportions such as Jt and 'the golden mean' <1>.) When Greaves returned to England he published his findings fully and was appointed Professor of Astronomy at Oxford; Newton used Greaves' figures to deduce that the Pyramid had been built on the basis of two cubits. One of these was far closer to the one he needed than that of the Greeks, but it still did not fit his theory. This was possibly because Greaves' and Burattini's measurements of the Pyramid's base were inaccurate, since they were unable to penetrate the accumulated debris around it. Indeed it was not until 1671, when the Frenchman Picard accurately measured a degree of latitude in Northern France, that Newton was able to prove his general theory of gravitation.20
This question ofmeasurement is only one example ofNewton's faith in the prisca sapientia of Ancient Egypt. He was also convinced that atomic theory, heliocentricity and gravitation had been known there.2l As he wrote in an early edition ofhis Principia Mathematica:
It was the most ancient opinion of those who applied themselves to philosophy, that the fixed stars stood immovable in the highest parts ofthe world; that under them the planets revolved about the sun; and that the earth, as one of the planets, described an annual course about the sun ... The Egyptians were the earlielit observers of the heavens and from them, probably, this philosophy was spread abroad. For from them it was, and from the nations about them, that the Greeks, a people more addicted to the study of philology than of nature, derived their first as well as their soundest notions of philosophy; and in the Vestal ceremonies we can recognize the spirit of the Egyptians, who concealed mysteries that were above the capacity of the common herd under the veil of religious rites and hieroglyphic symbols.22
In this passage, significantly, we have an epitome ofconventional views ofthe 17th century on the themes that concern us. Newton's admiration and respect for the Ancient Egyptians as the greatest scientists and philosophers are clearly expressed. In view ofthese earlier attitudes it is striking to find that he spent the last years ofhis life trying to defend the



168 BLACK ATHENA
argument set out in his Chronologies ofAncient Kingdoms Amended. This was that Egyptian civilization had been founded just before the Trojan War, and that the Great Sesostris was only the Shishak ofthe Bible, who had invaded Judaea after the time ofSolomon. From Newton's point of view this account damned the Egyptians as relative latecomers, making them inferior to the much older biblical tradition. However, Newton was concerned only with asserting Israelite priority, and he had no desire to deny that Egypt was the fount ofGreek wisdom. Thus his down-dating of Egypt led him to scrap all the Greek chronologies and make the Greeks later still.23 In the next chapter I argue that this attempt is best seen as part of the reaction by Christians and respectable deists like Newton to what the contemporary intellectual historian Margaret Jacobs has called the 'Radical Enlightenment'. But before coming to the Radical Enlightenment and the reformation of Freemasonry, it would seem useful to consider Late Renaissance beliefs in the significance of the Phoenicians, who have been so important in Masonic legend, because it was the half-Phoenician Hiram who built the Temple at Jerusalem which symbolizes the world and is at the core ofMasonic rituals and beliefs. We should remember that while Egyptian remained a mystery locked in the hieroglyphs, the boom in Christian studies of Hebrew that followed the Reformation relatively quickly led to the realization that Hebrew and Phoenician were mutually intelligible dialects of the same language.24 Therefore, long before its alphabet was first read by the Abbe Barthelemy in the middle of the 18th century, scholars had a relatively clear idea of the Phoenician language. Hebrew was, of course, generally believed to have been the original language of mankind, the speech of Adam and the Tower of Babel. There was thus an intensive search for Hebrew words in other languages, especially the European ones, a search which received some encouragement from what most scholars today would consider to be remarkable coincidences between words. Some, in fact, may be the result of pure chance but, as I have said in the Introduction, I believe that others are the result ofthe genetic relationship between Afroasiatic and Indo-European languages, while others come from loaning from Canaanite or Phoenician into Greek, Etruscan or Latin.25
I
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
The Phoenicians were seen as a conduit by which Hebrew or other cultures and languages, which we should now call Semitic, were diffused into Europe. The 16th-century political theorist Jean Bodin, for instance, used linguistic evidence to back his claim that all civilization and language had spread outwards from the Chaldaean. He saw the invasions of Danaos and Kadmos as essential steps in this process, and maintained that all the Greeks had originated from Asia, Egypt or Phoenicia.26 But although Bodin remained a respected political thinker, his and similar philological theories were soon outmoded by the work of scholars like Joseph Scaliger and Casaubon at the turn of the 17th century - men who did not speculate broadly on Hebrew connections and remain canon of Classical studies even today. The Huguenot Samuel Bochart, however, an equally learned and cautious scholar, is not there. In the 1640s, working on the correct assumption that Hebrew and Phoenician were essentially the same language, Bochart made an investigation of the plausibly Semitic place names around the Mediterranean that is still unsurpassed. He also conducted serious research on Canaanite loan words in Greek and Latin, which significantly ceased to be authoritative only in the I 820S.27
ANCIENT EGYPT
IN THE 18TH CENTURY
Newton is a pivotal figure. Coming from a world of astrology, alchemy and magic, he left a world in which these were no longer respectable. This change, of course, also reflects the social, economic and political transformation of the late 17th century, along with the triumph of capitalism in England and Holland, and statism in France. In this new world there was no place for Hermeticism, at least in its old form, but this did not mean that there was any less enthusiasm for Ancient Egypt. This enthusiasm soared in the century from 1680 to 1780. The best-known novel of the early part of the century, for instance, Fenelon's Tilbnaque, first published in 1699, features a Greek prince - Telemachus the son of Ulysses - as its hero, but it is full of animadversions about the material wealth, great wisdom, philosophy and justice of the Egyptians. These are specifically contrasted with



BLACK ATHENA
the inferiority of the Greeks, though the pharaoh Sesostris favoured them and had benevolendy given them laws.28 The middle ofthe 18th centurywas a high point ofEgyptophilia. As a French writer put it in 1740:
The only things talked about are the ancient cities of Thebes and Memphis, the Libyan Desert, and the caves of the Thebaid. The Nile is as familiar to many people as the Seine. Even the children have their ears battered with its cataracts and openings.29
The writer was presumably part ofthe Christian reaction against Egypt (see Chapter IV). In this period, however, even Europocentric writers welcomed as pioneers in the 19th and 20th century paid obeisance to Egypt. The learned Giovanni Battista Vico, who flourished in early18th-century Naples and whose Romantic, Europocentric and historicist view of history made him a hero among the 19th-century scholars, was in many ways hostile to the Egyptians. As a pious Catholic he explicidy excluded theJews from profane history, and put their history back to the Creation. He saw the Egyptians as only one among the earliest post-diluvian peoples. Nevertheless, they played a central role in his thinking. He maintained that his world historical scheme ofthree ages was based on Egyptian history as narrated by Herodotos: the stages ofthe gods, ofheroes and ofmen. These stages he saw as paralleled by three types of 'language': hieroglyphics, 'symbolic' and 'epistolary'. He also discussed and accepted the myth of Kadmos, linking it to Egypt.3o Montesquieu, too, was forced to concede that 'the Egyptians were the best philosophers in the world,.31 The mainstream of fashionable opinion in England and France seems to have been - as the French quotation above would suggest unequivocally enthusiastic about Egypt. One ofthe best-known English playwrights of the mid-18th century, for instance, was Edward Young, whose series of Egyptian plays have - not surprisingly - received very lime attention in later centuries. In 1752 the fifteen-year-old Edward Gibbon demonstrated his enthusiasm for Egypt by writing his first historical essay on 'the Age ofSesostris,.32 This favourable opinion, and the continued conviction that Greek culture had come from Egypt and Phoenicia, was translated into new
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
non-mystical scholarship. In 1763 the brilliant Abbe Barthelemy, decipherer of Palmyrene and Phoenician, presented a paper entided 'General reflections on the relations between the Egyptian, Phoenician and Greek languages'. In this his first correct asumption, based on Kircher - whose other work he considered fantastic - was that Coptic was a form ofAncient Egyptian. He also recognized the language family later known as Semitic, which he called 'Phoenician'. On these two bases, he established that Egyptian, although not a Semitic language, was related to the Semitic family. It is true that some of his lexical evidence can now be seen to have been faulty, as some Coptic words derive from Semitic loans into Late Egyptian. However, the main lines of his argument, based on between pronouns and grammatical features, are irreproachable. In this sense, then, Barthelemy was a pioneer ofwhat we should now call Afroasiatic studies. Barthelemy admitted that he could see no such grammatical parallels between Coptic and Greek. Nevertheless he believed in the Egyptian colonization and civilizing of Greece and maintained that 'It is imposs- ible that in this exchange ofideas and goods, the Egyptian language did not participate in the formation of Greek.,33 He then gave a list of etymologies from Egyptian into Greek, several of which - such as the Coptic hoI, Demotic IJf to the Greek ophis (snake) - would seem plausible today.34 Linguists were not the only scholars to maintain the priority and centrality of Egypt. The standard 18th-century work on ancient mythology, that of the Abbe Banier, continued the Classical and Renaissance traditions of deriving the Greek and Roman gods from those of the Egyptians.35 At the end of the century Jacob Bryant attempted to continue the work of Bochart, but he pointed out that the latter had not been completely successful because he had missed out the Egyptian component in Greek and Roman mythology and language.36 Bryant thus tried to explain their origins in terms of an 'Amonian' culture that contained both Egyptian and Phoenician elements. Despite the many fantastic aspects of his work, I believe that his approach was fundamentally the right one, but that he failed because Egyptian was still undeciphered and he did not use Coptic. In any event, his A New System; or anAnalysis ofAncientMythology, published in 1774,



BLACK ATHENA
was enormously respected at the tum ofthe 18th century; it was a major source book for the Romantic poets and above all for Blake.37 The same views dominated the history of philosophy. I have already mentioned that Europocentrists like Montesquieu saw the Egyptians as the greatest philosophers. EvenJacob Brucker, whose massive history ofphilosophy was a sustained attack on Plato, his Egyptian teachers and their esotericism and twofold truth, could not strip the Egyptians ofthe title 'philosophers,.38
THE 18TH CENTURY: CHINA AND THE PHYSIOCRATS
At the end of the 17th century there was a surge of European self-confidence. The Polish defeat ofthe Turks outside Vienna in 1683 was followed by the rapid Austrian recovery of Hungary. These, together with the Russian advance to the Black Sea, removed the Turkish threat from Europe. From now on, Europeans were on the advance against Asians by land as well as by sea. With this security, the leaders of the Enlightenment now felt free to show a preference for non-European cultures in their reaction against feudalism and traditional Christianity. By far the most favoured were Egypt and China, which were seen as very similar to each other, if not directly linked. These two civilizations were not seen merely as anti-European utopias -like Turkey, Persia and the land ofthe Hurons - which could be imbued with some vague general nobility and used to satirize and criticize Europe. Egypt and China had a much greater significance because they provided positive examples of higher and finer civilization.39 Both were seen to have had massive material achievements, profound philosophies and superior writing systems. Their most attractive features, however, were their model administrations. These were seen as being carried out rationally and without superstition by a corps ofmen recruited for their morality and wisdom, and required to undergo rigorous initiation and training. The secular French Physiocrats, on the one hand, felt closer to the Chinese: they liked to see Louis XV as a Chinese emperor and themselves as literati. Under their auspices China made a major cultural impact on France,
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT 173
and many if not most of the centralizing and rationalizing political and economic reforms of the mid-18th century followed Chinese
models.40
THE 18TH CENTURY: ENGLAND, EGYPT AND THE FREEMASONS
While the Physiocrats turned to China, the more mystical Freemasons, on the other hand, who included most of the major figures of the Enlightenment, preferred the Egyptians. All Masonic history is vague and that from before the reorganization of the craft in the early 18th century is doubly so, because it has to be gleaned from later writings that were deliberately distorted to create a mythological development. Nevertheless, a certain amount can be agreed. The Freemasons were originally secret societies of masons working on cathedrals and other major buildings in medieval Europe. In most parts ofthe continent they died out after the Reformation and the Wars of Religion; they survived in Britain but took on a very different character, with the entry of gentlemen members and the beginning ofwhat was called 'speculative masonry,.41 However, even before this change, which took place in the late 17th century, the Freemasons had a special attachment to Egypt. The Christian encyclopaedist and historian Isidore of Seville's Originum sive Etymologiarum, written in the 620S, contained Herodotos' and Diodoros' statements that geometry had been invented by the Egyptians to measure land after the disappearance ofboundary markers in the Nile Flood. For Isidore geometry was only one ofthe seven arts, but for masons it was centrally important as it was equated with masonry itself.42 Then again, several medieval Masonic manuscripts refer to Euclid's having founded masonry in Egypt for the Egyptian lords.43 Before dismissing this quaint story it should be remembered that Euclid seems to have lived all his life in Egypt.44 The Phoenicians, who were firmly linked to the Egyptians in the Bible - both are listed as sons of Ham - were at the core of Masonic mythology. Hiram Abif, the half-Phoenician craftsman of Solomon's temple, was probably part of Masonic legend by the 16th century.45 Supposedly murdered after the completion of the temple, he was



174 BLACK ATHENA
certainly a central figure of an Osiran type by the time the craft was re-formed at the beginning ofthe 18th.
I have already mentioned that Frances Yates saw a connection, through Bruno, between the Renaissance Hermeticists and the 17thcentury Rosicrucians. She also saw one between the latter and the Freemasons in the person of Elias Ashmole - founder of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford - who petitioned to join the Rosicrucians and is also known to have been initiated as a Mason.46 Frances Yates further showed the fundamental similarities between the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons in their use of the measurements and proportions of buildings - Solomon's temple or the Great Pyramid - to symbolize the structure of the universe and the desire to create a band of illuminati who could lead the world to a better, more peaceful and more tolerant way of life.47 On the other hand, she did not make the link established by later scholars between this tradition and the widespread millenarianism in the same circles. Many millenarians believed that knowledge had to be reassembled before the coming of the millennium.48 Therefore the scholar could be the midwife ofeschatology. It is from these schools of thought that the English 'scientific revolution' of the late 17th
century seems to have evolved.
\
Gentlemanly interest in Masonry increased in the 1670S and 80S. As well as contingent factors such as the massive rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of 1666, the growth of Freemasonry - like the contemporary rise of coffee houses and men's clubs - reflects changes in the urbanized commercial and landowning upper classes and the beginning of what one could call 'sub-political' activity outside the Restoration Court. During the reign ofthe CatholicJames II from 1685 to 1688, and after the Glorious Revolution ofthe latter year, there was a revival of radicalism which even brought back some of the survivors of the Commonwealth of the 1650s. However, in this movement which Margaret Jacob, as I have said, has called the Radical Enlightenment, the Puritanism and crude millenarianism of the earlier period was replaced by more modem ideas including deism, pantheism and atheism.
In the 1660s and 1670S atheism was largely associated with Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes' political idea ofthe Leviathan was less shocking than -..
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT 175
his atheism, which was based on the atomism and materialism of Demokritos and drew on the Epicurean tradition expressed most fully in the works ofthe great Latin poet Lucretius. At the same time atheism had been growing in Holland. In the long run, however, the most influential philosophy to emerge from there in the mid-17th century was the pantheism of the greatJewish philosopher Spinoza, which was influenced both by the Kabbalah and by Bruno.49 By the 1680s anew, equally radical intellectual force had emerged in England from the Hermetic and Rosicrucian traditions. The new movement argued for a twofold philosophy, for transcendence by the elite of the religious squabbles of the masses. The masses should be given toleration to practise their particular superstition, but political and intellectual power shoul,d be firmly in the hands of the enlightened
few. This general attitude was perfectly compatible with 18th-century English society. The Radical Enlightenment, however, contained thinkers likeJohn Toland, who not only drew from the Rosicrucian and Masonic traditions the notions ofa prisca theologia, but also read Bruno. Toland had absorbed many of Bruno's cosmological Hermetic and Egyptian ideas ofanimate matter and a world spirit, ideas which lead to pantheism or even atheism. Long before this Newton himself had hesitated, in private, on the question ofthe activity or passivity ofmatter, but Newtonianism was not merely scientific. It had a consequent political and theological doctrine which depended on the passivity ofmatter, with motion coming only from outside. Otherwise, theologically, the universe would need no creator or 'Grand Architect', let alone a 'clock-minder'; while politically, England would need no king Toland was fully aware ofthe republican implications of his ideas.50 John Toland was a central figure in the establishment ofthe legends, rituals and theology of speculative Masonry, much of which was standardized and canonized by the fusion of various Masonic and Rosicrucian groups in 17 I 7.51 By that time, however, the movement had been taken over by respectable Newtonians. Even bold figures like Newton's deputy and successor at Cambridge, William Whiston, who unlike his mentor openly proclaimed his Arianism - disbelief in the divinity of Christ - 'despised and actively combated' Toland and his



BLACK ATHENA
ideas.52 Nevertheless, some of the aspects of the Radical Enlightenment survived in respectable Masonry, which retained the essential elitism of the twofold philosophy and - in a new form - its Neo-Platonism. As in that tradition, ordinary people, and even most Masons, followed a partial faith, but the higher ranks transcended Christianity. For the Masons, as for the Hermeticists, the name of the Hidden God was too sacred or magically powerful to be revealed even to the lower grades, the craft. This name wasJ abulon, and - not surprisinglyit is a triple name, its first two syllables beingJ a for Yahwe, the God of Israel, and Bul for the Canaanite Ba<al.53 The last name came from )On, the Hebrew name of the Egyptian city )Iwnw, known in Greek as
Heliopolis and now a suburb of Cairo. According to Classical writers, Heliopolis had been a major centre of learning where, for instance, Eudoxos had studied.54 For the Freemasons, it was thus the epitome of ancient esoteric wisdom.55 Even more significandy, the city was a major centre ofthe sun-cult and was associated particularly with Ra, who - as mentioned on p. I 15 - became associated with Osiris by the 18th Dynasty. The Hermetic Texts refer repeatedly to the perfect city founded by Hermes Trismegistos which is closely associated with the sun; while Citta del Sole, City of tlte Sun, was a term used by Bruno, it was better known in the utopia written by his contemporary Campanella. 56
Campanella's city is populated by white-robed, pure and religious Solarians who are transparently Egyptian, and its buildings form an ideal model for the universe or a heliocentric system ofplanets.57 Here it should be remembered that Masonic ideology was built around the notion of sacred buildings symbolizing the universe. In the City of the Sun Moses, Christ, Mahomet and other great teachers were revered as magi, but the city was ruled by Hermes Trismegistos as sun priest, philosopher, king and lawgiver.58 In this case, then, the Masonic claim of drawing their traditions from Ancient Egypt has a basis in fact. Through the Hermetic Texts, Bruno, Campanella, Toland and/or his friends, one can trace a line from the final syllable ofthe name of their ineffable God to )Iwnw, the cult centre ofRa in Lower Egypt. The ascending mystery of Jabulon - from Judaeo-Christian to
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT 177
Canaanite-Phoenician, to Egyptian and the Osiran rituals for the upper grades - does not mean that the centrality of Egypt to the Freemasons was hidden. Masonic temples have frequendy been built in an Egyptian style - architecture is naturally of great significance to the craft showing that the 'Lodges' are to be seen as Egyptian temples. Their symbols are the 18th-century conception ofpurely logical hieroglyphs. (Some, like the pyramid and eye still to be seen on the Great Seal ofthe United States and the dollar bill, were taken direct from Egypt.) There is thus no doubt that the Masons have seen themselves as the successors to the Platonic Guardians and the latter's own model, the Egyptian
priests. If the impetus to identify with Egypt and some religious symbols came from earlier traditions, general knowledge of Egypt among 18th-century Freemasons came from contemporary scholarship. However, before examiniiig these new sources ofinformation I want to look at intellectual developments in this area in France.
FRANCE, EGYPT AND 'PROGRESS':
THE QUARREL BETWEEN
ANCIENTS AND MODERNS
The concept of,progress' had existed in Europe since the 16th century, when people began to realize that they now possessed products and inventions that the Ancients had lacked - sugar, paper, printing, windmills, the compass, gunpowder, etc. - all of them introductions from Asia. But during the devastating Wars of Religion from 1560 to 1660, it was difficult for such a view to spread or even to take firm root. The century from 1670 to 1770, however, was one of great economic expansion, scientific and technical development, and increased concentration of political power. The popular writer Perrault and the 'Moderns' in France were not merely fawning when they compared the age of Louis XIV to that of Augustus, and considered both the splendour and morals of their own times greater than those of the Ancients - especially those of the barbaric Homeric heroes.59 The cult of Louis XIV as Le Roi Soleil, the Sun King, appears to have been instituted at his coming of age in 166 I and seems to have



BLACK ATHENA
formed part of an attempt to create a national cult to which all the French, whether Catholic or Protestant, could rally.6o Indeed, as the triple godhead of Apollo, Herakles and God the creator, the cult or conceit clearly profited from Louis's youth and the end ofthe civil wars ofthe Fronde. The cult became central to the splendour and cultivation ofVersailles, and served the political purpose of'buying off' the nobility with the spectacles and pleasures of what was thought to the most splendid court on earth.61 As the young Apollo Louis was patron of the arts, and as Herakles he was mighty in war. He was a traditional sun with his ritualJournee, 'day', beginning with a ceremonial lever (rising) and ending with an equally formal coucher (going to bed or setting); but at the same time a Copernican sun, around which the planets circled. The cult also had alchemical aspects. The modern historian Louis Marin has shown that the use of fireworks and projecting dust into the air, over water in a blaze of light, which was central to his spectacles, demonstrated Louis's ability as the Sun to mix and transcend the four elements.62 Nevertheless, although this combination of alchemy, sun worship and a divinized monarch associated with the sun looks very Egyptian, I have not been able to find any direct connections between them. On the other hand, we do know from yoltaire that Louis was identified with Sesostris, among other monarchs ofAntiquity.63 Thus when describing the splendours of Ancient Egypt French writers during the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV must have had some arrierepensee oftheir own society. This leads us back to the quarrel which dominated European intellectual life during the 18th century: that between the Ancients and the Moderns. As mentioned above, the crux was the issue of whether the Moderns were now morally and artistically superior to the Ancients, and its centre was on the moral and artistic qualities of the Homeric epics; it should be remembered that Homer was seen by the Ancient Greeks as a cultural 'founding father'. From the 15th to the early 17th century the Egyptians had represented true Antiquity, but at the same time the authority ofEgypt had been used by innovators to challenge the ancient authorities of Aristotle, Galen, etc. In this respect, then, it had what one might call a double image. In late-17th- and earlY-18th
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT 179
century France, the progressive aspect was dominant: Egypt, with its identification with the France of Louis XIV, was clearly on the side of the Moderns. Fenelon, the author of Telemaque, was too slippery a character to allow himself to be seen on one side or the other. He loved Homer and admired the simplicity ofthe Greeks but, as I have said, his praise ofthe vast wealth and cultural superiority of the civilization of the Egypt of Sesostris, compared to that of Homeric Greece, clearly distanced him from Madame Dacier, the translator of the Iliad and champion of Homer's eternal artistic and moral perfection.64 The Abbe Terrasson, on the other hand, was much more committed to the Moderns. He was born into a talented Catholic family, and his father seems to have shared the millenarian preoccupations which dominated 17th-century English science. The father had his sons educated 'to accelerate the end ofthe world'. Jean Terrasson became a priest and a leading figure in French intellectual life from the I690S until his death in 1750.65 As Professor of Greek and Latin at the College de France, and in key positions in both the Academie and the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, he dominated the study of ancient history in earlY-18th-century France. A major attack on the Iliad, published in 1715, put him in the forefront of the Moderns. 66
Terrasson also achieved fame as the translator of Diodoros Sikeliotes, the detailed and favourable commentator on Egypt and the colonization of Greece. But he was best known for a novel which first appeared in 173 I: Sethos, histoire ou vie tiree des monuments: anecdotes de l'ancienne Egypte. With a relatively shallow pretence, Terrasson claimed that his work was that of an unknown Alexandrian of the 2nd century AD. Although a fake the novel incorporated, with references, a mass of material largely from the ancient writers from Herodotos to the Church Fathers, as well as from the novel Aithiopika, which really does seem to have been written in the 2nd century AD. Terrasson's hero, Sethos, is an Egyptian prince born a century before the Trojan War. There were in fact two pharaohs named Setyrendered Sethos in Greek - in the 13th century BC, while the traditional date ofthe Trojan War was 1209 BC. Terrasson seems to have taken the



180 BLACK ATHENA
name from the Ptolemaic Egyptian historian Manetho, who used the name for the Great Pharaoh Ramesses II, the son ofSethos I. The fact that the name and date are reasonably accurate shows that the I8thcentury scholars could at times make profitable use ofClassical sources for the reconstruction ofEgyptian history.67 The structure ofthe novel, however, is fictional and resembles that ofFenelon's Telemaquein that it is concerned with the adventures and education of a noble young prince. But it also reflects Diodoros' stories of the civilizing conquests of Osiris. After going through various mysterious initiations, Sethos travels around Africa and Asia setting up cities and establishing laws, later retiring to join a college ofinitiates.68
Like Ttlemaque, Serhos contained many animadversions on the glories ofEgyptian civilization and, even more strongly than the former work, it insisted on the great superiority of Egypt over Greece. Terrasson described the academy at Memphis as far finer than that of Athens, giving details ofall the arts and sciences in which the Egyptians excelled the Greeks. Using Classical quotations, he demonstrated that the founders of Greek politics, astronomy, engineering and mathematics had all studied in Egypt. Further, he also maintained that there were close parallels between Greek and Egyptian mythology and ritual and that the Greeks had derived their forms from Egypt.69 He saw the main cultural transmission as having come through Greek study in Egypt. Nevertheless, he also mentioned the colonizing activities of Kadmos and Danaos, and it is significant that he firmly attached the Phoenicians to the glories of Egyptian civilization.70
Sethos immediately became the standard Masonic source of information about Egypt. As Masonry spread throughout Europe and North America the book was translated into English and German and was published in numerous editions throughout the 18th century. It became the source of many plays and operas, most of them Masonic, ofwhich the best known is The Magic Flute. Both Schikaneder's libretto and Mozart's score are crammed full of Masonic-Egyptian symbolism.71 For more than a century the novel was openly used as a source for Masonic history, and Sethos still remains the mainspring of its legend and ritual. The tradition of the primacy of Egypt has remained so important to the craft that Masonry has been unable to bow to popular
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
or academic fashion on this issue. As a Masonic writer put it in the extremely philhellenic I830s:
All the ancient and modem historians agree that formerly Egypt was the cradle of sciences and arts and that contemporary peoples draw their religious and political principles from it. As the learned Dupuis has shown: 'Resembling a tree as ancient as the world, Egypt has lifted her magnificent head in the chaos ofeternity and has enriched all parts of the world with her products. She has pushed her roots towards posterity under different forms and varied appearances but with a constant essence reaching up to us with her religion, her morality and her science.72
MYTHOLOGY AS ALLEGORY
FOR EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
The idea that mythology is an allegorical interpretation of historical events or natural phenomena to the masses, who are capable ofgrasping only a partial truth, was well established in Antiquity. It is part of the general scheme of the twofold truth or philosophy, referred to so frequently above. Thus it was the dominant mode of understanding myth from the Renaissance to the end ofthe 17th century. Frank Manuel has sensitively described the way in which this approach was rejected and overthrown in the 18th-century swing towards common sense. Some 18th-century mythographers, like Freret and the Abbe Banier, did as the Greek euhemerists had done 2,000 years earlier and tried to interpret myths as the clumsy telling of literal truths.73 Myths were now supposed to have been taken at face value by the Ancients, just as the contemporary peoples of other continents appeared to take theirs. The change was linked to the growing sense of 'progress' and the increasing tendency, beginning with the 17th-and 18th-century writer Fontenelle, to revive an analogy - stated in Antiquity by St Augustinebetween human history and the growth of a child to maturity.74 In a complete reversal of the previous view of myth as the hidden signs of a higher civilization, it was now seen as the poetic expression of the



BLACK ATHENA
childhood of mankind, to be valued not for its truth content but as a source ofinformation about human psychology.
Despite all this activity, however, the allegorical interpretation of myth as an expression of the ancient wisdom of the Egyptian priests survived and flourished among Freemasons and Rosicrucians. Manuel has shown how it was revived in print in the immense and immensely dull works ofCourt de Gebelin.75 We, however, are far more concerned with the works of the scholar and revolutionary Charles Fran<;ois Dupuis.
As the great 20th-century historian of science Giorgio de Santillana has pointed out, it is not accidental that Dupuis is so little known today. His beliefs continue to form a coherent challenge to both Christianity and the myth of Greece as a cultural beginning; thus he and his work
had to be buried.76 Dupuis was a brilliant scientist and the inventor of semaphore, and was also active in politics during the French Revolution. His great reputation as a scholar and his dedication to moderate revolutionary principles made him a natural choice for director of cultural events during the Directory from 1795 to 1799, and he became president of the legislative body during the Consulate under Napoleon that followed.
Dupuis's most famous work was the massive Origin ofall Cults, which appeared in 1795. In it he that all mythologies and religions could be traced back to one source, Egypt. Furthermore, he believed that nearly all myths were based on one oftwo principles: the miracle of sexual reproduction, and the intricate movements ofthe stars and other heavenly bodies. Although myth was couched in spectacular and fantastic terms, he argued that it concealed an inner scientific truth which could be explained only in terms ofscience. Much ofhis gigantic work was in fact a detailed matching of myth to astronomy, which _ unfortunately for proponents of the Aryan Model - he knew much better than any later Classicist. Dupuis had two major themes. One of his thrusts was against Christianity, and he showed with massive detail the Near Eastern mythological background ofthe Gospels. For him the religion was built from the debris of the misunderstood priestly allegories. His second major theme was the explanation of Greek myths _ which, following Herodotos and the ancient tradition, he took to be
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
fundamentally Egyptian - in terms of astronomy. Here again he produced a series of astounding correspondences, or coincidences, between such myths as the twelve labours of Herakles and the annual stellar movements through the twelve houses of the zodiac. Frank Manuel sees Dupuis as interesting, but ultimately absurd.77 De Santillana, by contrast, had a completely different view of him:
Dupuis's work contains practically everything that has been found out since on Archaic astronomy. He had only the Classical sources to work with, practically no correct Oriental texts, and about other parts of the world only the occasional reports of travellers ... with these insufficient instruments, he worked out what seems to elude modem researchers. His knowledge of the pre-Sokratics is far more extensive than what can be derived from Hermann Diels, that bible of current scholarship,' yet it remains this side of wrong guesses. His Origine may be judged extreme, but it is sound, coherent and impressive. 78
In the twenty years following their publication Dupuis's views were enormously influential, and were seen as the ideological and theological parallel to the political challenge of the French Revolution. The Christian response to his attack will be examined in Chapter V, as well as the linked Hellenist challenge to his view ofGreece as an appendage ofEgypt, seen for instance in the statement that 'Egypt can be regarded as the mother of all theogonies and the source of all the fictions which the Greeks received and embellished, for it does not appear that they invented much.,79
THE EXPEDITION TO EGYPT
Whether or not Dupuis played a direct role in the decision to go to Egypt, there is no doubt that his presence as an important intellectualpolitical figure reflects the general Egyptophil atmosphere in Napoleonic circles before 1798, when the great Expedition there was launched. It is known that he influenced its further penetration of



BLACK ATHENA
Upper Egypt, which he believed to have been the source of Egyptian and hence world culture.80 Plans for the colonization ofEgypt had in fact been made long before the Revolution, in the 1770S at the height of French Masonic enthusiasm for Egypt. While there were important political and economic reasons for the Expedition, there is no doubt that the ideas of France reviving the 'cradle of civilization' that Rome had destroyed, and the desire to understand the Egyptian mysteries, also provided important motivation. 81
It is uncertain whether or not Napoleon was a Mason himself. There is, however, no doubt that he was deeply involved in Masonic affairs, that there were many members of the craft in the higher ranks of his army, and that Masonry 'flourished exceedingly' under his rule.82 It is also clear that he took his imperial symbol of the bee from Egypt and probably through Masonic sources.83 His initial behaviour in Egypt also indicates this influence: he tried, for instance, to transcend Christianity and appear as a champion of Islam and Judaism, and he dutifully went into the Great Pyramid and had a mystical experience.84 The whole Expedition is a fascinating turning point in European attitudes to the East. In many ways the elaborate surveys, maps and drawings, and the stealing of objects and cultural monuments to embellish France, was an example of the standard pattern of studying and objectifying through scientific enquiry that became a hallmark of European imperialism and a basis of the 19th-century 'Orientalism' described so well by Edward Said.85 On the other hand, there were still many traces of the older attitude towards Egypt, and among the scientific members of the Expedition there was the belief that, in Egypt, they could learn essential facts about the world and their own culture and not just exotica to complete Western knowledge - and domination - of Africa and Asia. For instance, the mathematician Jomard made detailed measurements ofthe Pyramids and surveys of Egypt on the basis ofancient sources that maintained that the Egyptian measures oflength were based on a detailed knowledge of the world's circumference; and that - as mentioned on pp. 166-7 in connection with Newton - the Great Pyramid incorporated specific fractions of latitude. When Jomard
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
published his findings in 1829, at a time of passionate Hellenism, the astounding correspondences which he discovered were quickly rejected on grounds ofalleged inaccuracies. His conclusions seem much more credible in the light of recent and more precise measurement.86 Even in 1798 Neo-Hellenism and Romanticism were already major forces. Despite his Masonic concerns, Napoleon was very much a child of his age: he clearly imagined himself as Alexander - seen in a very Greek way - and he took Plutarch's Lives with him to provide Classical models. He also had a copy of the Iliad, whose hero Achilles had been an inspiration to Alexander. More directly relevant was the copy of Xenophon's Anabasis, depicting a succession of episodes in which European Greeks cut their way through much larger numbers of assorted Asiatics. This suitable text became a 'bible' for 19th- and earlY-20th-century imperialism, although it took some decades for it to replace the democratic"orations of Demosthenes and the Iliad as the standard text for beginning the study of Ancient Greek.87 Napoleon's other reading provides a perfect sample ofcontemporary Romantic taste. There were the poems of Ossian, the central significance ofwhich to the Romantic movement will be discussed in the next chapter. Finally, there were the Bible and the Sanskrit Vedos representing the new Romantic craze for Ancient India, to be described
in Chapter V.88 Napoleon's position was, as usual, dramatic but his situation as someone living within the Ancient Model but caught up in the new paradigm of'progress' and Romantic Hellenism was quite typical ofthe age. Schikaneder and Mozart might still be celebrating Egyptian wisdom in The Magic Flute, written in 1791, but that was in remote Vienna. Things were different in Western Europe. By 1780 Edward Gibbon was referring in a staged progressive way to 'Egyptian theology and the philosophy of the Greeks', and before this he had burnt his 'juvenile' essay on Sesostris, arguing that 'at a riper age I no longer presume to connect the Greek, theJewish and the Egyptian antiquities, which are lost in a distant cloud.,89 In the same decade another distinguished scholar made a move in the same direction. Abbe Barthelemy's work on the decipherment of Phoenician and the comparison of Coptic, Hebrew and Greek has



186 BLACK ATHENA
already been mentioned; in 1788, near the end of his long life, he published what was to become his best-known work, The Voyage ofthe Young Anacharsis. This story of the journey of a young Scythian prince through 4th-century Greece was an erudite and heavily annotated novel in very much the same style as Sethos, which, along with Telemaque, was one of its inspirations.90 Anacharsis's success equalled that of Sethos: it came out in more than forty editions in French and was translated into eight languages.91 But the reversal it gives to the situation of Greece is fascinating. Where Fenelon's innocent young northerner Telemaque came from Greece to sophisticated Egypt, Anacharsis comes from virtuous Scythia to Greece in a period ofsophistication and decadence, with Greece nevertheless the site of a great civilization. While glorifYing Greece, Barthelemy was too firmly rooted in the Ancient Model to neglect the civilizing roles ofEgypt and Phoenicia. In his introduction to the novel, he saw the Egyptians as arriving as legislators for the primitive Greeks. Following Freret, he dated this arrival not merely to Kekrops, Kadmos and Danaos, but to 300 years earlier in the 20th century Be with Inachos and Phoroneus - whom Greek tradition tended to regard as Pelasgian or autochthonous.92 Further, he interestingly anticipated the argument put forward seventy
years later - in the 1850S - by the great Semitist Ernest Renan that the
I
harsh Semitic character and its harsh monotheism were created by the desert sun. Barthelemy argued that the blazing Egyptian sun and contrasting deep shade produced a severe simplicity ofthought and art, while the sparkling light of Greece had produced something that was lighter and more vital:
Thus the Greeks, emerging from their forests, no longer saw objects under a frightening and sombre veil. Thus the Egyptians in Greece softened bit by bit the severe and proud expressions in their paintings. The two groups, now making a single people, created a language that sparkled with vivid expressions. They clothed their old opinions with colours which changed their simplicity but made them more seductive.93
This view puts Barthelemy in what we can now see as a transitional phase. That is, he accepted Winckelmann's Romantic Neo-Hellenist
[CH. III] THE TRIUMPH OF EGYPT
view of the Egyptians as stiff, formal and somehow dead, while the Greeks were seen as laughing children. On the other hand, he did not see things as people in the 19th century did, in terms of the absolute need for Greek racial and linguistic purity. Thus he appears to have had no difficulty with the Ancient Model's descriptions ofthe colonizations. Not only was Anacharsis a major route for escapism during the French Revolution, but it was probably the most influential history of Greece during the peak of Philhellenism in France. The most influential English book, a massive History tifGreecewritten by Gibbon's friend William Mitford, was more straightforwardly academic. Mitford was much less impressed by Greece than Barthelemy had been. As a consistent conservative he rejected the idea of ,progress' and was not at all sure that Greece had surpassed Egypt and the Near East; in fact, he generally preferred the latter. As he wrote in the first volume of his History, which remained Q1e standard work on the subject from its publication in 1784 until the 1830s:
Assyria was a powerful empire, Egypt a most populous country governed by a very refined polity, and Sidon an opulent city abounding in manufactures and carrying an extensive commerce when the Greeks, ignorant of the most obvious and most necessary arts, are said to have fed upon acorns. Yet it [sic] was Greece the first country in Europe that emerged from barbarism; and this advantage it seems to have owed intirely [sic] to its readier communication with the civilized nations ofthe East.94
Mitford also maintained the Ancient Model's view of the colonization of Greece:
It appears that in a very remote period some revolutions in Egypt, whose early transactions are otherwise little known to us, compelled a large proportion of the inhabitants to seek foreign settlements. Crete probably owed its civilization and polity to this event. Some of the best-supported ofAncient Grecian traditions relate to the establishment of Egyptian colonies in Greece; traditions so little accommodating to national prejudice and so perfecdy consonant to all known history, that for their essential circumstances they seem unquestionable. [my emphasis]95

The argument that traditions or legends are plausible if they are widespread, fit other historical patterns and outside information, and go against the interests of those who report them remains very powerful. However, it is interesting to note that there are no earlier defences of the Ancient Model. This is because the owl of Minerva flies only at dusk - that is, traditional beliefs are articulated only when they are under challenge. As with many embattled defenders of the status quo, Mitford argued that all serious scholars agreed with his position and believed with him in the Oriental origins of Greek civilization. He did, however, admit that a 'shallower' scholar, Samuel Musgrave, had argued that Greek culture was autochthonous.96 It is to this kind of thinking that we must turn our attention in Chapter IV.
CHAPTER IV
HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT
IN THE 18TH CENTURY
W
E ARE NOW APPROACHING the nub of this volume and the origins of the forces that eventually overthrew the Ancient Model, leading to the replacement ofEgypt by Greece as the fount of European civilization. I concentrate on four of these forces: Christian reaction, the rise of the concept of 'progress', the growth of racism, and Romantic Hellenism. All are related; to the extent that Europe can be identified with Christendom, 'Christian reaction' is concerned with the continuation of European hostility and intensification ofthe tension between Egyptian religion and Christianity. On the question of 'progress', I argue that its rise as a dominant paradigm damaged Egypt for two reasons. The country's great antiquity put it behind later civilizations; while its long and stable history, which had been a source of admiration, now· became reason to despise it as static and sterile. In the long run we can see that Egypt was also harmed by the rise of racism and the need to disparage every African culture; during the 18th century, however, the ambiguity of Egypt's 'racial' position allowed its supporters to claim that it was essentially and originally 'white'. Greece, by contrast, benefited from racism, immediately and in every way; and it was rapidly seen as the 'childhood' of the 'dynamic' 'European race'.



190 BLACK ATHENA
Racism and 'progress' could thus come together in the condemnation of Egyptian!African stagnation and praise of Greek/European dynamism and change. Such assessments fitted perfectly with the new Romanticism, which not only emphasized the importance of geographical and national characteristics and the categorical differences between peoples but saw dynamism as the highest value. Moreover, Greek states were small and often quite poor and their national poet was Homer, whose heroic epics fitted splendidly with the 18th-century Romantic passion for Northern ballads, most ofwhich were extremely gory, like the Iliad. Here, as with language, a special relationship was seen between Greece and Northern Europe which was marred only by Greece's geographical position in the South-Eastern Mediterranean and the Ancient Model, which emphasized her close association with the Middle East. All in all, while Egypt, along with China and Rome, were the models of the Enlightenment, Greece became allied to the lesser, but growing 18th-century intellectual and emotional current of Roman_ticism.
CHRISTIAN REACTION
Here it should be emphasized that for most of the almost 2,000 years with which we are concerned, the tension or 'contradiction' between Christianity and the Egyptian 'twofold' philosophy was not - in the Leninist or Maoist sense - an 'antagonistic' one. As movements confined to the elite, Hermeticism and Masonry did not fundamentally threaten the social, political or even the religious status quo. However, the exclusive claims of Judaeo-Christian-Islamic monotheisms make any kind of unconformity difficult to tolerate, and there have been periods of bitter rivalry between the two traditions.
The ruthless and bloody destruction of Gnosticism and NeoPlatonism by the early Church was mentioned in Chapter II. In the 15th and 16th centuries, however, the Church generally tolerated or even encouraged Platonism and Hermeticism. The execution of Bruno was not surprising, given his blatant attacks on the Judaeo-Christian tradition and his call for a return to Egyptian religion. Moreover, the burning was followed not by a ban on the study of Egypt but by the
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 191
encouragement and massive funding of what Frances Yates calls Athanasius Kircher's 'reactionary Hermeticism' or, to put it more charitably, a Church-sanctioned 'Egyptology' which included Kircher's establishment of Coptic studies. 1 Although Hermeticism and Rosicrucianism were often influential in Northern European intellectual circles, they did not loom large in the violence of the Thirty Years War in Germany, the Fronde revolts in France and the antimonarchical struggles in England and Holland. The religious struggles between Catholic and Protestant or High and Low Church had little or nothing to do with Hermeticism. Neo-Platonism and Hermeticism, as I have said, were often philosophies espoused by moderates as attempts to transcend the raging political and religious battles ofthe time. Similarly, the atomist atheism associated with Thomas Hobbes grew up in an atmosphere ofdespair at competing brands ofreligion. Thus in England in the 1660s and 1670S moderate men like Ralph Cudworth, who were concerned with two main foes, Catholic superstition and Puritan Enthusiasm, saw Platonism as an antidote to both.2 Apart from its transcendence over sectarian squabbles, its doctrine that there was a light or life immanent in the world weakened the Enthusiasts' - or inspired believers' - claims to have a monopoly of holy spirit. Furthermore, Cudworth believed that the dangers of atheism from the Egypto-Platonic identification ofspirit with matter, or the Creator with the Creation, was less acute than that from Hobbesian mechanical, atomist atheism.3 Newton was intellectually formed in this atmosphere and it is in this context that his early admiration for the Egyptians, referred to in the last chapter, must be seen. However, his attitude towards Egypt changed drastically in the 1690S and the last years of his life were spent on chronological works, ofwhich the most important was The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended. Here, as mentioned on p. 168, Newton prooed, on the basis ofthe Bible and astronomy, that the claims for antiquity made by the Egyptians and other peoples had been grossly exaggerated, and that the Israelites had existed long before all the others. Newton's most recent biographer, Professor Westfall, describes this as 'a work of colossal tedium' and believes that in it Newton had 'produced a book with no evident point and no evident form'. The only



BLACK ATHENA
explanation Westfall can give for it is that it had a concealed deist message.4 But the same could be said for most ofNewton's works, and I do not think it provides a sufficient motive for the immense labour he put into his Chronology. Indeed, it could be argued that it was the most orthodox work Newton ever wrote: William Whiston, who can be described as Newton's deist conscience, fiercely attacked The Chronology, as did the French atheist Freret.5 Furthermore, as Westfall points out, Newton had effectively been co-opted by the Establishment by the end of his life. Thus I think it more useful to see The Chronology as the result of what the modem intellectual historian Professor Pocock describes as 'a complete reversal in Cudworth's attempt to demonstrate that ancient thinking was naturally in accord with Christian theology'. Pocock attributes this partly to the 'impact ofSpinoza', an attribution that has problems because, as the historian Professor Colie has shown, Cudworth was fully aware of Spinoza's thinking by the 1670s, and his greatwork The TruelntelleaualSystem ofthe Universe contained an attack on position.6 This is not to deny that Spinoza's pantheism continued to weaken the possibility of a Christian Platonism after the publication of Cudworth's work in 1679. However, the new factors after the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1689 were Toland and the Radical Enlightenment. All in all, I think Newton's later work and his lowering of the antiquity of the Egyptians and other ancient peoples should generally be seen as a 'respectable' deist and Christian defence against the Radical Enlightenment and the latter's use ofthe antiquity of Egypt and the Orient. As with Bruno in the 16th century, the peaceful coexistence between Christianity and esoteric Egyptian religion and philosophy, which had lasted through most of the Renaissance, broke down in the 1690S and the Christians struck back.
THE 'TRIANGLE':
CHRISTIANITY AND GREECE
AGAINST EGYPT
The defence ofNewtonianism brought Greek studies into alliance with Christianity, and this brings us to a central concern of this volume, which is less with the binary conflict between Egypt and the Bible than
r"
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 193
with the triangular relations between Christianity, Egypt and Greece. During the first centuries of the Christian era the main struggle was between Christians and pagans. As the dominant culture of the East Mediterranean during this period was Hellenic with a religion based on Egypt, both Christians and pagans - ofwhom the most influential were the Neo-Platonists - saw the distinctions between Egypt, the Orient and Greece as relatively unimportant. Jews like Josephus and Church Fathers like Clement of Alexandria and Tatian, on the other hand, scored points against the Greeks by pointing out the lateness and shallowness of Greek civilization in comparison with those of the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Chaldaeans, Persians and so on and, ofcourse, the Israelites. They also stressed Greece's heavy cultural borrowings from the more ancient peoples.7 The possibility of pitting Greeks against the Egyptians, Chaldaeans and others, in the defence of Christianity, did not occur until the Renaissance. I have already pointed out that Erasmus' hostility to Hermeticism in the early 16th century was essentially linked to his defence of Christianity and religion against magic. Erasmus, however, was also a champion of pure Latinity and the study of Greek.s During these same decades, Germans were becoming aware of striking similarities between their language and Greek. The nouns of both had four cases rather than the five of Latin. Both Greek and German used the definite article and made massive use ofparticles and of prepositions with verbs. After the Reformation, and the break away from Roman Catholicism, the relationship became much stronger, with the new image of Greek and German as the two languages of Protestantism. Luther fought the Church of Rome with the Greek Testament. Greek was a sacred Christian tongue which Protestants could plausibly claim was more authentically Christian than Latin. With the spread ofthe Reformation to England, Scotland and Scandinavia, a feeling developed that the Teutonic-speaking peoples were 'better' and more 'manly' than the Romance-speaking nations of France, Spain and Italy and that their languages as a whole were superior to Latin and on a par with Greek. As a 17th-century English writer put it:



194 BLACK ATHENA
Our language was a dialect of the Teutonick, and although then but in her infancie, yet not so rude as hopefull, being most fruitfull and copious in significant and well-founding rootes and Primitives and withall capable and apt for diffusion from those her rootes into such a Greek-like ramosity [sic] of derivations and compositions, beyond the power ofLatine and her off-spring dialects ...9
Greek studies flourished in Protestant schools and universities throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. It is striking, for instance, how many of the major French Hellenists of the 17th century - including Isaac Casaubon and Mme Dacier, who will be discussed when I come to the cult of Homer - were brought up as Huguenots. lO From using Greek to attack Roman Catholic superstition, it was not such a long step to employing it against Egyptian magic. Nevertheless, Casaubon's criticism of the antiquity of the Hermetic Texts was not juxtaposing a rational Greece to a magical and superstitious Egypt. It was using critical methods of approach to Greek texts to discredit the age, and hence the value, of Egyptian wisdom.
A similar approach was used seventy years later by Richard Bentley. Known in his lifetime as the hated and tyrannical Master of Trinity College Cambridge, Bentley is, however, a hero in the history of Classics as the discoverer ofthe digamma, or rather ofthe fact that the w sound represented as F in some Greek alphabets had existed in Homeric and other Greek dialects, in which it was not written. This Bentley did with extreme ingenuity by observing that in certain cases words beginning with vowels did not elide or come together with the preceding syllables. He is even more respected for his rigorous critical scholarship which, though not particularly appreciated in his own day, has given him the later reputation as the greatest English Classicist ofall time. II
Richard Bentley was also the first man to popularize Newtonian physics and to spell out its theological and political implications: that, as matter could not move itself, a god - of generally regular habits - was needed to create and maintain the universe, just as a king was necessary to a Whig constitutional monarchy. Bentley put this scheme forward in 1692 , when he preached the first series ofsermons or lectures set up by
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 195
the famous Anglo-Irish chemist Sir Robert Boyle against 'notorious infidels, namely, Atheists, Theists, Pagans, Jews and Mahometans,.12 Bendey hardly mentioned the last two. His concern was clearly with the first three, and most ofall with the Radical Enlightenment. He seems to have been especially concerned with the radical thinker and pioneer of FreemasonryJohn Toland's use ofBruno's Egyptian notion ofanimate matter, which the radical had used to attack Newtonian physics. Bentley and his circle also seem to have known about Toland's republicanism. Toland was fully aware ofthe interconnections between his physics and his politics. 13 Bentley used his own formidable intelligence and Classical scholarship not only to expound the Newtonian system and its implications, but also to cast doubt on the reliability and age of the Greek sources referring to Egyptian and Oriental wisdom and astronomy. 14- Thus he tried to deprive Toland and the radicals ofone of their most powerful sources oflegitimacy. What most concerns us here, however, is the alliance between Newton and Bentley and the combination of the new science and critical Classical scholarship to defend the status quo. It is ironic that these two men, who were always on, ifnot over, the brink ofArianism or deism became two of the most effective defenders of the Christian Establishment. 15
THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN
GREECE AND CHRISTIANITY
A more orthodox alliance between Christianity and Greece was present in the work of John Potter, a younger contemporary of Bentley at Wakefield Grammar School and later Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1697 Potter brought out four volumes on Greek political institutions and religion which, with new editions, remained standard until replaced by Dr Smith's Diaionary in 1848}6 Working in a tradition that went back at least to Lucretius, Potter maintained not only that Athens, unlike the rest of Greece, had never been conquered by barbarians but also that Greek culture and institutions had come from Athens. 17 In this way he was able to detach Greece from the Near East without challenging the ancient authority for the invasions.



BLACK ATHENA
This tension is also present in his treatment of Greek religion. Here, though he tried to raise Thrace to equal status, he admitted that the religion had come from Egypt but went on to treat it as ifit were purely Greek. 18 Throughout the 18th century one finds similar attempts, especially among Christian apologists, to reconcile a desire to play down Egypt and elevate Greece with an inability to confront the Ancient Model.
'PROGRESS' AGAINST EGYPT
While the proponents of the Radical Enlightenment in England used the antiquity of Egypt and Mesopotamia to bolster their position, they, like the French Moderns, seem to have felt themselves to be 'progressive'. In the long run, however, Egypt was bound to lose from the establishment of the new paradigm of 'progress'. The transformation this brought about can be seen in the contrast between Newton's attack in the 17 lOS on the antiquity ofEgypt and the East, and Bishop William Warburton's very different approach in the 1730S. Warburton saw his The Divine Legation ofMoses as part of the struggle against deists, Spinozists and pantheists, whose opposition to Christianity he traced back to the Neo-Platonists. 19 Thus, in attacking the Radical Enlightenment, Warburton gave defence of Christianity a progressive edge. As Pocock describes his position:
far from seeing modern philosophy as threatening religion with its scepticism, he was much inclined to the view that only in modernity had philosophy attained to the sanctity and moderation compatible with belief. Even the irreligion of modern times - which he identified with Jacob's Radical Reformation [Enlightenment] _ seemed to Warburton an archaistic revival of 'ancient' modes o f philosophizing. 20
Warburton's view of Egyptian religion itselfwas regressive, and not so far from that of Newton. Writing in the 1730S, he could not deny that Egyptian religion had once been a sublime monotheism, but he argued that it had fallen into appalling idolatry. In what Frank Manuel has described as a bishop's 'sense of solidarity with the priesthood of
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 197
Egypt', he blamed this corruption on the politicians.21 In Warburton's eyes, however, priority was no advantage. He savaged Newton's chronology, even though this put him alongside such notorious deists as
William Whiston and atheists like Nicolas Freret.22 For Warburton, the fact that the Greeks came later made them better. They had excelled their teachers. While he was obliged to admit that the Greeks had learnt the names ofthe gods and their rituals from the Egyptians, he emphatically denied that they were the same.23 He also maintained that while Pythagoras had studied in Egypt for twentyone years he had set out his theorems only on his return to Greece. On this basis, he argued that the Egyptians had been unable to hypothesize - a canon that survives today. A similar ambivalence towards Ancient Egypt was expressed byJacob Brucker, the great German historian of philosophy of the mid-18th century.24 Unable to deny the massive ancient tradition that the Egyptians had been philosophers, Brucker nevertheless argued that they should more properly be called 'theogonists' who had invented and manipulated allegories. According to him, true philosophy had begun with the 'Pre-Sokratic' Ionians, but the real break with theogony had come with Sokrates himself. Sokrates' triumph, according to Brucker, was that, as Professor Pocock puts it, he
abandoned the attempt to know nature, regarding it instead with reverent scepticism, and had focused philosophy on its proper object, the discovery of moral truths leading to the apprehension of the true god.25
This anti-scientific 'philosophy', however, was betrayed by Plato, who had unluckily studied with Pythagoreans in Sicily and priests in Egypt. According to Brucker, Plato had reimported the allegory, poetry and esotericism from which the Ionians and Sokrates had tried to break away.26 Thus - by making a rather improbable categorical break between Sokrates and his devoted disciple and biographer, Plato Brucker was able to claim superiority for the Greeks, at the same time retaining the ancient view that all types of Platonism were integrally bound to the Egyptian tradition.



BLACK ATHENA
EUROPE AS THE
'PROGRESSIVE' CONTINENT
The Turkish defeats of the 1680s and the general acceptance of physics Europe's self-image. In the postNewtoman world wnters like Montesquieu, whose reference to the Egyptians as the greatest philosophers has been noted above, began to contrast Oriental 'wisdom' with the 'natural philosophy' of Europe.27 Montesquieu wrote this in 1721; as the century continued, the notion of European superiority increased with European economic and industrial progress, and expansion into other continents. The position was far from that produced with the. triumph of imperialism in the 19th century, however, for no European ofthe 18th century could claim that Europe had created herself. Nevertheless, it was argued that Europe was now further advanced than any other continent, and here there was a close parallel with the situation in 4th-century and Hellenistic Greece vis-a-vis the older civilizations. For instance: there is the frequently quoted passage in Epinomis, by Plato or one ofhIs students, after a laudatory description ofEgyptian and Syrian 'And let us note, that whatever the Greeks acquire from foreIgners IS finally turned by them into something finer.,28
. The claim that some ineffable quality is added to imported techmques, concepts or aesthetic styles often occurs in culturally peripheral nations like England, Germany, Japan, Korea or Vietnam. Cultural pride needs to be maintained in the face of foreign borrowing that is so massive that it cannot be denied, or where borrowings run counter to a hierarchy of cultural or 'racial' superiority.29 As the popular writer Oliver Goldsmith wrote - in 1774 in his History ofthe Earth - strikingly paraphrasing Epinomis: 'Those arts which might have had their invention among other races of mankind have come to their perfection there [in Europe].,3o
'PROGRESS'
It is frequently said that the clearest 18th-century statement ofthe idea of 'progress' was that of Condorcet's Sketch of a historical table of the progress ofthe human spirit, written in 1793. However, most of the ideas
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 199
Condorcet propounded there had been set out earlier in a speech On the Successive Progress ofthe Human Spirit, given in 1750 by the nineteenyear-old Anne Robert Turgot. Turgot, who later became a finance minister of Louis XVI, was close to the leading Physiocrats and was a promoter of Chinese economic ideas. He was subsequently described as the founder of political economy. From the speech and unfinished draft histories, his ideas on 'progress' are quite clear.31 These ideas are important in themselves and because oftheir bearing on the views held by Turgot and his contemporaries on the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Greeks. According to the new paradigm, these civilizations had to be seen in ascending order as the human spirit 'progressed'. But, as in all schemes ofhistorical evolution - notably the Hegelian and the Marxist - each stage was seen as having started out beneficially 'progressive' but as having later slipped into decadence and opposition to the new forces. Thus Turgot saw Egypt and China as initially pioneering: 'they advanced with great strides towards perfection.,32
The Egyptians and Chinese were perceived as having been mathematicians, philosophers and metaphysicians. Unfortunately, in both civilizations these 'sciences' had been sapped by superstition and priestly dogmatism.Just as Bishop Warburton had tried to exculpate the priests on this issue out of 'clerical solidarity', so intellectuals like Turgot and Condorcet were delighted to have yet another stick with which to beat them, for here, as in the modern world, priests could largely be blamed for the decadence.33 However, Turgot differed from the Physiocrats, who admired contemporary China, by condemning the country to the past; and this part of the 'progressive' scheme brought him - or kept him - very close to the old, regressive picture of the Egyptians as having been in possession - probably from the Israelites of a pure and true religion, but as having lost it. Turgot also saw the decadence as the result of the despotism of Egyptian and Chinese government. Like Montesquieu, however, who had attributed it to the morally improving effects of irrigation, Turgot maintained that Egyptian and Chinese governments were not as bad as their hot climates would seem to determine, or as the Mahometan forms actually were.34 Like Brucker and most 18th-century thinkers,



200 BLACK ATHENA
Turgot included the Pythagoreans, N eo-Platonists and, by implication, Plato himself among the decadent Asiatic metaphysicians.35 For him, the higher stages of the progress of the human spirit began with Aristotle's logic and continued directly to Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Newton and Leibniz.36 As far as Greece was concerned Turgot, although encouraged by the country's disunity and liberty, believed that 'it was only after many centuries that one saw the appearance of philosophers in Greece.,37
For Turgot the real Hellenic glory was in poetry, which derived directly from the richness of the Greek language. This richness had come about because
The Phoenicians, inhabiting an arid coast, made themselves the agents of exchange between peoples. Their vessels spread through, out the Mediterranean. They began to reveal nation to nation, astronomy, navigation and geography perfected each other. The coasts of Greece and Asia Minor were filled with colonies ... From the mixtures ofthese independent colonies with the ancient peoples ofGreece and with the remains ofsuccessive barbarian invasions the Greek nation was formed ... by these multiple mixtures this rich language was formed, expressive and sonorous, the language for all the arts. 38
The liberal denial of the Egyptians in favour ofthe Phoenicians was an indication of future attitudes on their relative importance. Otherwise, Turgot's statement reflects the contemporary linguistic research already mentioned in connection with Barthelemy, and Turgot's scheme also seems to reflect the origin of French from a mixture of Celtic, Latin and Germanic languages.39 This does not, however, affect its competitive plausibility against the equally subjective image ofGreek as a language that was somehow 'pure', like the idealized German. The picture ofpurity is extremely improbable, not only on geographical and historical grounds but also, as Turgot pointed out, on linguistic ones too. While Turgot and his contemporaries proclaimed and articulated the new vision of 'progress', they retained respect for the Egyptians and Phoenicians and never questioned the legends oftheir having colonized
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 201
and civilized Greece.4O Nevertheless, the introduction ofthe 'progressive' paradigm was ultimately fatal to the reputation of the Egyptians. Their antiquity - which had previously been one oftheir major assets
now became a liability. The obverse to the fall of the Egyptians was a rise in the status of the Greeks. Before coming to this, however, we must consider the two forces that aided Christian reaction and the 'progressive' paradigm in the overthrow ofthe Ancient Model: racism and Romanticism.
RACISM
All cultures have some degree of prejudice for, or more often against, people whose appearance is unusual. However, the intensity and pervasiveness of Northern European, American and other colonial racism since the 17th century have been so much greater than the norm
tlfat they need some special explanation. It is difficult to say whether or not racism was unusually strong before the 16th century, the first in which Northern Europeans came into frequent contact with peoples from other continents. In the early anti-Semitic ballads about the alleged murder of Little Sir Hugh, the evil Jews do not appear to have been seen as particularly dark.41 It is even possible that with the influx of French and Italians after the Norman Conquest, dark colouring had high status, and early ballads do sometimes contrast the poor fair girl with the rich brown one. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the 'fair maid' is seen as morally superior and the ballads of two sisters, which appear to have very old Norse antecedents, lay emphasis on the wicked dark sister as opposed
to the good fair one.42 By the 15th century, too, there is no doubt that clear links were seen between dark skin colour and evil and inferiority, when the newly arrived Gypsies were feared and hated for both their darkness and their alleged sexual prowess.43 Whether or not this concern with and dislike of the dark 'other' was exceptionally intense in medieval Northern Europe, it is generally accepted that a more clear-cut racism grew up after 1650 and that this was greatly intensified by the increased colonization of North America, with its twin policies of extermination



202 BLACK ATHENA
of the Native Americans and enslavement of Africans. Both these presented moral problems to Protestant societies, in which equality of all men before God, and personal liberty, were central values which could be eased only by strong racism.
:he Classical writer most often appealed to to justify slavery was Anstotle, who had argued at length in its favour. The appeal was linked to the fact that his work was shot through with the belief that Greeks were inherently superior to other peoples:
The races that live in cold regions and those of Europe are full of
and passion but somewhat lacking in skill and brainpower; for thiS reason, while remaining generally independent, they lack political cohesion and the ability to rule others. On the other hand,
the Asiatic races have both brains and skill but are lacking in courage and willpower; so they have remained both enslaved and subject. \The Hellenic race, occupying a mid position geographically, has a measure of both. Hence it has continued to be free, to have the best political institutions and to be capable of ruling others given a single constitution. 44
In this way Aristotle linked 'racial superiority' to the right to enslave other peoples, especially those of a 'slavish disposition'.
Similar perceptions of'racial' differences appear to have been central to the thought ofJohn Locke, the philosopher ofthe late-17th-century Whigs. There is no doubt that Locke, who was personally involved with slave-owning American colonies, was what we should now call a racist, as was the great 18th-century philosopher David Hume. Whether or not these attitudes affected their philosophies is more debatable, but Harry Bracken and Noam Chomsky's arguments for this connection
seem very plausible.45
Locke's consistent disparagement of Native Americans was essential to his politics, because the land the indigenous population inhabited was needed to provide a wilderness available for English and other settlers. The possibility of such colonization was necessary to the argument that men had a choice as to whether or not they joined the Social Contract, with all its manifest inequalities.46 Locke refused to justify the enslavement of people of the same nationality, and called
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 203
what might appear to be slavery of this kind mere 'drudgery'. For him, as for most thinkers of the time, slavery was justified only when it was the result ofcapture as an alternative to a deserved death in a just war.47 Christian European attacks on heathen Africans and Americans, for instance, were classed as 'just wars' because the latter were not defending their property, but merely 'waste land'. Furthermore, Locke had the curious but convenient belief that Africans and Americans did not practise agriculture and, according to him, the only entitlement to land came from cultivation.48 The general scheme allowed for the taking of black slaves by Europeans. Moreover, the very existence of large numbers ofAfrican slaves led to the belief that they were 'natural slaves' in the Aristotelian sense. By the 1680s there was in fact a widespread opinion that Negroes were only one link above the apes - also from Africa - in the 'great chain ofbeing,.49 This type of thinking was made easier by Locke's nominal
ism: his denial of the objective validity of 'species' and view of them as subjective concepts. He was particularly sceptical of the inconvenient category of 'man':
And I imagine none ofthe Definitions ofthe Word man, which we yet have, nor Descriptions of that sort of Animal, are so perfect and exact, as to satisfy a considerate inquisitive person; much less a general consent . . .50
This position is in sharp contrast not only to the biblical 'God made man in his own image' but also to Descartes's insistence on a categorical distinction between unthinking animals and thinking man. Empiricism thus seems to remove an (admittedly flimsy) barrier against racism; however, there is no necessary connection between empiricism and racism. 51
To recapitulate: it is certain that Locke and most 18th-century English-speaking thinkers like David Hume and Benjamin Franklin were racist: they openly expressed popular opinions that dark skin colour was linked to moral and mental inferiority. In Hume's case, racism so transcended conventional religion that he was a pioneer of the view that there had been not one creation of man but many different ones, because 'Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen in



BLACK ATHENA
so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men.,52 The centrality of racism to European society after 1700 is shown by the fact that this 'polygenetic' view ofhuman origins continued to grow in the early 19th century, even after the revival of Christianity.
Racism was not so clear-cut in 18th-century France. Nevertheless, the Aristotelian - and pseudo-Platonic - scheme of climatic and topographic determinism of races that had permeated the work ofJean Bodin in the 16th century was revitalized by Montesquieu in the 18th.53 Montesquieu became famous in 1721 through his Persian Letters. At one level he was using distinguished Persians to criticize and satirize Europe; at another, he was setting up the image of Europe as the 'scientific' and 'progressive' continent. This primacy was explained as the result of her beneficent, temperate climate. His pro-European views and hostility to Asia and Africa came out more clearly in his Spirit ofLaws, which was published in 1748.54
Rousseau, in his Social Contraa, published in 1762, violendy attacked any justification ofslavery. On the other hand, he followed the school of geographical determinism, believing that a people's virtue and political capacity depended on climate and topography. He was Europocentric and showed remarkably little interest in Egypt and China. This was a trait which persisted among later Romantics, whose predilections were nearly always for the misty and mountainous North of Europe, which was seen as the true repository ofhuman virtue.
ROMANTICISM
After the defence ofChristianity and the idea of ,progress', racism was, I believe, the third major force behind the overthrow of the Ancient Model; the fourth was Romanticism. To put it crudely, Romanticism maintains, against the Enlightenment and the Masonic tradition, that reason is inadequate to handle the important aspects of life and philosophy. Romanticism is concerned with the local and particular, rather than the global and general. There is also an oversimplified, but useful, contrast to be made between the 18th-century Enlightenment, with its interest in stability and the ordering ofspace, and the Romantic
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 205
passion for movement, time and 'progressive' development through history. Outstanding examples of Enlightenment achievement are the accurate mappings ofthe world's coasts, Linnaeus' systematic arrangement of natural species, and the American Constitution, which is.
supposed to last for ever. Apart from the extraordinary achievements ofnatural science during the period of Romantic dOIninance from 1790 to 1890 there was an enormous interest in history, and in both the chiefmodel used was that of the 'tree'. Trees, which are to be found in Darwinian evolution, Indo-European linguistics and most 19th-century histories, provide the ideal Romantic image. They are rooted in their own soils and nourished by their particular climates; at the same time they are alive and grow. They progress and never tum back. Like the image ofhistory as biography mentioned above, trees have a simple past and a complicated and ramified present and future. Nevertheless, the image of the tree had disadvantages in the description of European and Greek history, and I shall return to this theme later.55 It should be borne in mind that despite the enormous influence of Rousseau, Romanticism was never as strong in France as it was in Britain and Germany, and it is in these regions that one should look for the movement's further development. First, Germany: during the early part of the 18th century, Germany went through one ofits most acute crises ofnational identity. In striking contrast to France, Holland and England, for more than a century following the end ofthe Thirty Years War in 1648 there was continued military devastation, political fragmentation and economic backwardness. The same period saw the military and cultural rise of France to a point where it seemed about to become a 'New Rome', capable of absorbing all Europe.56 The language and culture of the German courts, including that of Frederick the Great in Prussia, was French; most of the books published in Germany in the first half of the century were in Latin and French. Thus there was a reasonable fear, voiced by the late-17th-century philosopher and mathematician Leibniz and later patriots, that German would never develop into a language capable of being used for cultural and philosophical discourse; it might even, like the Germanic Frankish language spoken by the early rulers of



II
I
206 BLACK ATHENA
France, disappear altogether in the face ofFrench. German culture and the German people were seen as being in mortal danger.57 The most significant response to this crisis on the part ofthe German Romantics was the attempt to return Germans to their cultural roots, and to create an authentic German civilization from the German soil and the German people. According to the new Romantic and progressive views, peoples now had to be seen in their geographical and historical contexts. The racial genius or spirit belonging to the land and its people changed its forms according to the spirit ofthe age or, to use a term developed in the 1780s, its Zeitgeist; but a people always retained its immutable essence. The most powerful figure concerned with this aspect of the Romantic movement was Johann Gottfried Herder, who was also important in relation both to Neo-Hellenism and the development of linguistics. Herder himself stayed within the universalist bounds of the Enlightenment, maintaining that all peoples, not merely ,Germans, should be encouraged to discover and develop their own genii.58 Nevertheless, the concern with history and local particularity, and the disdain for rationality or 'pure reason' apparent in his views and those of other late-18th- and earlY-19th-century German thinkers including Kant, Fichte, Hegel and the Schlegels, provided a firm basis for the chauvinism and racism ofthe following two centuries.
OSSIAN AND HOMER
The two purest essences ofa 'race' were seen as being its language and folksong. As sounds they were temporal, not spatial. They were not stable but moving, if not 'living', and they were seen as communicating feeling, not reason. Furthermore, they were felt to be expressions not merely of the whole race but of its most characteristic and vital period, its 'childhood' or primitive stage. At this point, then, we focus on folksong and ballads.
In the concern with songs and epics and their relation to a people, the main impetus behind the German movement came from Britain or, more precisely, Scodand. The Act of Union with England in 170 7, the defeats ofthe Old Pretender and his son Bonnie Prince Charlie in 17 I 5
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 207
and 1745 and the destruction of the Gaelic culture of the Highlands forced a major realignment of the old nationalism. Upper-class English-speaking Scots very quickly developed a safe literary sublimation of nationalism, in which there was a cult of the simple, the backward and the remote combined with a nostalgia for a lost innocence.59 The chief artistic expressions of this were genuine or newly manufactured ballads or folksongs. By far the most influential product of this movement was James MacPherson's forgery of a Gaelic epic cycle, allegedly by the 3rdcentury poet Ossian, about the heroic deeds of his father. Ossian was published in 1762 and, although soon shown to be a forgery, remained the most widely read poem in Europe for the next fifty years. It has been mentioned above (see p. 185) as being among Napoleon's books in Egypt. Even before Ossian, Bishop Percy had brought out his Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. This collection of genuine Scottish and English Border ballads also had a powerful influence throughout Europe, especially in Germany, where it inspired Herder to promote a new movement to collect and publish folksongs.6o The folksong movement became integrated with the 'storm and stress' school started by Goethe around novels (Romane in German - from which 'Romanticism' gets its name). For most ofthe later 18th century, Ossian was considered to be better than Homer. This does not mean, however, that Homer was unpopular. He had held a very special position in Ancient Greece: he was 'the Poet' and his epics were central to all Greek education and to the sense of being Greek.61 In Rome, a Greek education always began with Homer. In the Renaissance - despite the dominance of the Platonic-Egyptian tradition - there was considerable concern for Homer, especially among Protestant scholars, with their attachment to Greek as a sacred and non-Roman language. As Tanneguy Le Fevre, a leading Huguenot scholar and the father ofAnne Dacier, wrote in 1664:
The Ancients - geographers, poets, rhetoricians, theologians, doctors of medicine, moral philosophers, and even army generals regarded Homer as an ultimate source of wisdom in each of their professions.62



208 BLACK ATHENA
Madame Dacier herself translated Homer into French and championed him against the Modems and the general public, whom she believed to be prejudiced against him. She and her husband made a well-paid and opportune conversion to Catholicism just before Protestantism was banned, a conversion which is difficult to reconcile with her concern with morality and high principles. However, the tension seems to have been eased by her continued loyalty to her father's secular passion for Homer. In 17 14 Madame Dacier published her extremely influential On the Causes ofthe Corruption ofTaste. In this she attacked the Moderns like Terrasson, who had criticized Homer and the Greeks as being too primitive and crude for civilized peoples like the modem French and the Ancient Egyptians. She saw Homer as the earliest poet who had expressed the feelings of an uncorrupted age, but to make him the earliest she had to deny the importance not only of Egyptian but of 'Hebraic' civilization.63 However, Madame Dacier and the Ancients were not successful in promoting the Greeks in France, the centre of
the Enlightenment. As Voltaire wrote in the middle of the century: 'It seems to me that the Greeks are no longer fashionable and that was true from the times ofM. and Mme Dacier.,64
Things were different in other countries. The Italian scholar and visionary Giovanni Battista Vico, writing in the 1720S, saw Homer as the epitome of 'poetic wisdom' in the first two 'divine' and 'heroic' stages of his historical scheme.65 Then in the 1730S an Aberdonian, Thomas Blackwell - the teacher of MacPherson, creator of Ossian saw Homer as the poet of the primitive age, and the Greeks as the childhood of Europe.66 The new concept of 'childhood' that developed with such speed in the 18th century comes at the intersection of ,progress' and Romanticism. Childhood was seen as a period of emotion and feeling before rationality, but also as one that was without the sexuality and corruption of adulthood. Furthermore, it was a period of potential - looking towards the future and not tied to the past. Thus the growth of childhood went hand in hand with the growth of Romanticism and 'progress'. Classical authority for the image of Greeks as children came from Plato's Timaios, in which, as I have already mentioned, Plato
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 209
reports an aged Egyptian priest as telling Solon: 'You Greeks are always children: there is no such thing as an old Greek ... You are always young in soul, every one ofyou. For ... you possess not a single belief that is ancient ...,67 For ancient, medieval and Renaissance scholars such a statement was utterly damning. Even the 18th-century Modems were able to condemn the Greeks as childish and trivial. With the rise ofthe concept of,progress' this could be, and was, turned to the Greeks' advantage.
ROMANTIC HELLENISM
It is often assumed that as the country was part of the Classical world, study or admiration of Greece should be seen as a form of Classicism. In the 18th century, however, Hellenism is far more usefully seen as belonging to the Romantic camp. The gendemen ofthe Enlightenment were concerned with order, regularity and stability over wide regions. In the contemporary world they tended to be concerned with the 'big ones', concentrating their efforts at reform on France, Russia and Prussia. In Antiquity they preferred powerful states that had lasted over long periods of time, like China, Egypt and Rome. As Classicists they read most of the Latin authors, but litde or no Greek. By the 1790S, however, the upper classes were beginning to read Homer in the original. Thus the shift from reason to sentiment was associated with a shift of attention from Imperial Rome to Classical and Homeric Greece. Romantics longed for small, virtuous and 'pure' communities in remote and cold places: Switzerland, North Germany and Scodand. When considering the past, their natural choice was Greece. It clearly qualified in terms of smallness, and its states could, with some stretching of the imagination, be described as virtuous. Its lacks in the other respects could be temporarily overlooked, although in the long run it was more difficult to do this. In many ways the destruction of the Ancient Model and the establishment ofthe Aryan one can best be seen as attempts to impose these Romantic ideals of remoteness, cold and purity on this most unsuitable candidate.68 Romanticism had existed from the beginning of the Enlightenment,



210 BLACK ATHENA
and in the very cosmopolitan 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, Locke's pupil, 'sensibility' - combined with a cult of beauty and form - was associated
with a Neo-Hellenism.69 Then in the 1730S, British Romantic Philhellenism increased with Blackwell's association ofHomer with Scotland, mentioned on p. 208. In the same decade, the Society ofDiIettanti was founded. The Society, as its name suggests, started as a social club for rich young men, but it became more serious in the import of Classical statues from Italy to decorate the houses and parks of the British nobility. In 1750 it extended its activities, commissioning a thorough and accurate survey ofthe surviving works ofancient art in Athens. The commission reflected a great new enthusiasm for Greek art, which West Europeans had so far seen only in Roman copies. At the same time daring noblemen began to extend their Grand Tours from Italy to the Levant, which included Greece.70 Enlightened scholars could study the general truths of the world by reading books in the comfort of their studies.
But this was not good enough for Romantics, with their concerns for feeling and particular locality. They wanted to confront, and ifpossible even smell, the original documents and other remains ofthe period and place they wished to study.71 In the 1750s, for instance, Robert Wood went to the Troad - the region around Troy - and read the Iliad in situ. In his Essay on the Original Genius and Writings ofHomer, which appeared in 1775, Wood saw Homer as the product of a particular people in a particular landscape. Although - unlike later Romantics - he still maintained that Homer was one man, he drew on the ancient tradition that Homer had been blind to stress his illiteracy. Wood's picture of Homer was very 'Ossianic' - that is, it was of a primitive and almost Northern bard, the poet of the childhood not only of Greece but of all Europe. 72
By the middle of the century the Romantic mood, Europocentrism, and the concept of 'progress' were creating a considerable enthusiasm in Britain for the Greeks, who seemed to fit all these criteria. James Harris, the English grammarian - who, it is important to note, was concerned with spoken language - hated Orientals and saw the Romans as culturally inferior. By contrast he adored the Greeks, and in 1751 he wrote of them:
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 211
In the short space of little more than a century, they became such statesmen, warriors, orators, historians, physicians, poets, critics, painters, sculptors, architects, and (last of all) philosophers that one can hardly help considering that Golden Period as a Providential

Thus the concept of the 'divine Greeks' was already formed. The lateness and rapidity oftheir development were now seen not as signs of shallowness but as marks of extraordinary greatness. By 1767 Britons were even beginning to assert Greek superiority over the Egyptians. As another Aberdonian, William Duff, wrote in that year:
In Greece the sciences made rapid progress and reached a very high degree of improvement ... if the Egyptians were the inventors, this proves them to be ingenious, but the Greeks shewed themselves to possess superior genius ... Arts and sciences have been known to the Chinese for many ages ... yet they have not ...74
The Classicist Samuel Musgrave led a disreputable life, and - as has been mentioned in the last chapter - Mitford called him a 'shallower' scholar. Nevertheless, Wilamowitz-Moellendorf gave him an honourable mention in his History ofClassical Scholarship.75 In 1782 Musgrave published a 'Dissertation on Greek Mythology' in which he argued that Greek culture was autochthonous, and even denied the massive tradition that Greek religion had been derived from Egypt. He did this on the basis of an oblique reference from Lucian, a prolific sophist and satirist ofthe 2nd century AD, and from the dissimilarities between the best-known names of the Egyptian and Greek gods.76 However, as we have seen, Musgrave's arguments were crushed by Mitford, and the Romantic breakthrough on this aspect ofthe Ancient Model was made in Germany.



212 BLACK ATHENA
WINCKELMANN AND
NEO-HELLENISM IN GERMANY
The greatest champion of Greek youth and purity in the mid-18th century was the German Johann Joachim Winckelmann. This hardworking and obsessional man had taught himself Greek in a period when the Hellenic scholarship of the 16th and 17th centuries had virtually disappeared. In order to get near the Greek works of art he loved, but had never seen, he converted to Catholicism and spent most of his life in Rome as a priest and an art expert for exquisite cardinals.
Winckelmann specifically rejected the idea that the Greeks had a monopoly on philosophy.77 Their triumph was in something that for him was far more important: aesthetics. As early as 1607, the great Renaissance scholar Scaliger had tried to establish a periodization of four stages for Greek art and poetry, to which Winckelmann acknowl
edged his debt.78 In many ways, however, his scheme seems closer to the contemporary notions of a staged history and in particular to Turgot's Progress ofthe Human Spirit, according to which there were three stages, very similar to those set out eighty years later by Auguste Comte as the theological, the metaphysical and the scientific.79 Winckelmann's History ofAncient Art, published in 1764, was the first attempt to integrate the history of art into that of society as a whole. According to Winckelmann, Egyptian art had only reached the primitive stage, in which the artist was forced to concentrate his attention on what was strictly essential.80
Egyptian art, the argument ran, was imperfect because it could not have been otherwise. Its development was blocked by unfortunate natural and social circumstances: in a very early example of modem racial discrimination against Ancient Egyptians, Winckelmann followed Aristotle's claim that they were mostly bandy-legged and snubnosed.81 Thus they had no beautiful artistic models. Going against all Classical sources, and to some extent even against Montesquieu, he maintained that Egypt's geographical situation was unfortunate and not conducive to high culture. He also claimed - in the teeth ofHerodotos Plutarch, Diodoros and other ancient writers who had emphasized thei;
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 213
passionate joy and grief - that the Egyptians were pessimistic and unenthusiastic. At one level this conviction reflected the prevailing view that the reason so many peoples of other continents gave up in the face of the European advances was that they had been debilitated by their environments, and were naturally weak and passive.82 At another it was an appreciation of the very real Egyptian concern with death which could be interpreted, within the 'progressive' paradigm, as reflecting the fact that Egypt had always been doomed to be surpassed by more 'vital' civilizations.83
Winckelmann did not approve of Greek art merely because it came later in the historical sequence. A of extraordinary passion, he loved every aspect of his image of Greece, seeing its two dominant essences as liberty and youth.84 According to him Greece epitomized freedom, while Egyptian culture had been stunted by its monarchism and conservatism and was the symbol ofrigid authority and stagnation which also happened to be non-European. In his mind, the Greek city-states contained the liberty without which it was impossible to create great art. Winckelmann, and his followers, loved this liberty and youth for their freshness and vitality. Yet he insisted upon the soft gentleness of Greek art, and the 'noble simplicity' and 'serene greatness' of Greek culture as a whole, which he saw as the result of the equable Greek climate. Moreover, central to his love of Greece was his appreciation of Greek homosexuality. Winckelmann himself was homosexual, and the major homosexual strand which has persisted in modem Hellenism has continued to be associated with him.8s While Winckelmann's interpretation ofthe Greeks as liberal, serene and youth-loving has remained a central theme in later Hellenism, even in the 18th century there were other images ofGreece. The beliefin the tragic and 'Dionysian' qualities of Greek culture, which culminated in the works of Nietzsche at the end of the 19th century, was already apparent among 18th-century thinkers, as well as in the poets HOlderlin and Heine at the beginning of the 19th.86 Admiration for the austere and authoritarian Dorians was another strand of Hellenism. Nevertheless, all these late-I8th- and 19th-century schools of thought were united in their perceptions of the relationship between Egypt and



II

Greece. Egypt represented an earlier, lower and strangely dead stage of human evolution which had been raised by the European genius of Hellas to a qualitatively higher and more vital level. The effect ofWinckelmann's work on Germany was electric. As the historian of Classics Rudolph Pfeiffer has written:
A break was made with the Latin tradition of humanism and an entirely new humanism, a true new Hellenism, grew up. Winckelmann was the initator, Goethe the consummator, Wilhelm von Humboldt, in his linguistic, historical and educational writings, the theorist. Finally, Humboldt's ideas were given practical effect when he became Prussian Minister of Education and founded the new university of Berlin and the new humanistic gymnasium.87
Goethe, himself generally credited as the founder of Romanticism, exuberantly called the 18th century 'the century ofWinckelmann'.88 In the 1930s, in a grimmer mood, the brilliant English Germanist Miss Butler saw Winckelmann as the first figure in what she called 'the tyranny of Greece over Germany'.89
The second major response to the German crisis ofidentity in the 18th century, along with the desire to return to authentic German roots, was Neo-Hellenism. I have already discussed the long-standing perception of the 'special relationship' between Greek and German, and Greek's position as the Protestant religious opponent to Catholic Latin. In the 18th century the threat to Germany was from Paris, a 'new Rome', and from French, a Romance language. In addition to the revival ofthis old cultural alliance between Greek and German, there was a new motive for the identification ofGermany as the New Hellas. By the I 770S it was becOIning clear that Germany had the potential to be a major cultural centre; however, this was not reflected politically. The wars of Frederick the Great convinced contemporaries that Prussia could not unite Germany and that the Austrian Empire was equally incapable of this. The combination of cultural strength with political weakness and disunity seemed to indicate that, while Germany could not become a new Rome, she could be the new Hellas.
The leading dramatist of the age, C. M. Wieland, wrote several
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 215
plays about the Greeks during the 1760s and 1770S.90 Goethe was completely captivated by the Greeks, and in his middle age he made frequent, though not very successful, attempts to learn Greek.91 Herder, too, had a passionate admiration for the liberty and" artistic creativity of Athens, writing about Greek poetry and persuading Goethe to renew his study ofthe language.92 These thinkers and artists were not as obsessed by Greece as Winckelmann and the 19th-century Neo-Hellenists; but there is no doubt that Ancient Greece and its perceived intimate relationship with modem Germany were becoming increasingly central to German cultural life, including the newly formed 'academia'.
GOTTINGEN
Winckelmann is generally recognized as the founder ofthe discipline of art history, and Goethe certainly accepted him as a scholar. Nevertheless he was not acceptable to the new kind of 'professional' academics beginning to emerge in late-18th-century Germany, particularly at Gottingen. Gottingen can well be considered the embryo of all later, modem, diversified and professional universities. It was established in 1734 by George II, King of England and Elector of Hanover, was well endowed and as a new foundation was able to escape many of the
,
medieval religious and scholastic constraints that persisted in other universities. With its British connections it was a conduit for Scottish Romanticism as well as for the philosophical and political ideas of Locke and Hume, whose racism has been mentioned above (see pp. 202-4)·93
It is true to say that while exclusive professionalism was the distinctive form of Gottingen scholarship, the chief unifying principle of its content was ethnicity and racism. This, of course, was the result not merely ofthe English scholarly contacts but, much more importantly, of prevailing opinion in German cultivated society as a whole.94 Despite the Gottingen professors' insistence on their academic high standards and detachment, they were inevitably influenced by such 'popular' writers as Winckelmann, Goethe and Lessing. Europocentricism was strikingly apparent in the views of one of the



216 BLACK ATHENA
university's founders, Kristophe August Heumann. As a pioneer ofthe new professionalism Heumann established a scholarly journal, Aaa Philosophornm, in the first issue of which, in 1715, he argued that although the Egyptians were cultivated in many studies they were not 'philosophical'. This claim - which his contemporaries Montesquieu and Brucker, as we have seen above, did not dare to make - was both striking and daring in the light ofthe strong ancient association between philosophia and Egypt.95 Heumann's categorical distinction between Egyptian 'arts and studies' and the Greek 'philosophy' is rather difficult to comprehend, as his definition of the latter was 'the research and study of useful truths based on reason,.96 Nevertheless its very imprecision made, and makes, the claim that the Greeks were the first 'philosophers' almost impossible to refute. , It is true that there is one ancient assertion that only the Greeks were capable of philosophizing, that attributed to Epicurus by Clement of Alexandria; Clement went on to demonstrate the extreme implausibility of the claim.97 There is also the statement on the Greeks' making everything 'finer' from Epinomis, quoted on p. 198.98 These should not, however, detract from Heumann's daring in impugning the massive ancient and modem tradition which saw Egypt and the Orient as the seats ofwisdom and philosophy. There is little doubt that Heumann's views on this were linked to his German nationalism and his Europocentricism. He advocated, and tried to practise, writing philosophy in German when this was almost unheard of; he was also a climatic determinist even before Montesquieu.99 According to Heumann, philosophy arose in Greece because it could not flourish in climates that were too hot or too cold; only the inhabitants of temperate countries like Greece, Italy, France, England and Germany could create true philosophy. 100 Heumann's views on the Greek origin ofphilosophy, like his views on the philosophical capacity ofthe German language, were more than fifty years ahead of his time. His work on the history of philosophy was eclipsed by Brucker's massive works in which, as we have seen, the author took a compromise position but did not deny the Egyptians the title of'philosophers'.101 Nevertheless, Heumann's influence persisted at Gottingen and it is not surprising that Dietrich Tiedemann, the first
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 21 7
of a new wave of historians of philosophy of the 1780s, had studied at that university.102 For this ethnic and 'scientific' school, as for all subsequent writers on the subject, it became axiomatic that 'true' philosophy had begun in Greece. By this decade historical studies were being revolutionalized, especiallyat Gottingen. One professor there, Gatterer, started a project of writing histories not of kings and wars but as 'biographies' of peoples. Another, Spittler, studied institutions as expressions and moulders of particular peoples.103 Still more important was the work of the historian and anthropologist Meiners, later to be honoured by the Nazis as a founder of racial theory. Between 1770 and 1810 Meiners developed the earlier general concept of the 'genius of the age' into an academic theory of Zeitgeist. 104 Possibly unaware of Vico's earlier work along these lines, Meiners argued that each age and place had a special mentality determined by its situation and institutions.lOs The extent to which this approach was lacking among earlier historians has been exaggerated, but there is no doubt that after the 1780s it became impossible for serious historians to judge an action or statement without taking into account its social and historical context. Closely linked to this development was another ofMeiners' innovations - 'source criticism'. This involved the historian assessing the value of different historical sources according to their author and social context, and basing his interpretation largely or solely on the reliable ones. Meiners attacked earlier writers like Brucker for having accepted historical sources uncritically and indiscriminately, instead of choosing those that revealed 'the spirit of the age' in which they were written. 106 This was an approach which fitted well with the new 'scientific' spirit ofGottingen and the tradition already apparent in Galileo, who argued that 'one necessary reason once found destroys utterly a thousand merely probable reasons.' The measure has proved extremely useful in experimental sciences; however, as Giorgio de Santillana has pointed out,
as soon as we leave the territory of direct and continuous check what Galileo expressly called the ordeal - and take it as a philoh· I ' d I ' d b ' . 107

218 BLACK ATHENA
Meiners' procedures, which have come to dominate 19th- and 20thcentury historiography, do seem to be essential to a historian as opposed to a chronicler: it is inevitable that one should give different weight to different sources. The danger arises from a lack of self-consciousness and the awareness that by neglecting or rejecting certain sources because they are supposed to be 'out of tune' with the age concerned, the historian can impose almost any pattern he chooses. This increases the element of the history that merely reflects the age and concerns of the historian. In the case ofthe late 18th century, the situation was made worse by the 'modern' historians' confidence that they 'knew better'. They were convinced that, unlike earlier scholars, they were writing objectively. Furthennore, Meiners and his colleagues insisted on trusting what they confidendy saw to be the 'qUality' of their sources, rather than their quantity or even their analogical plausibility. When dealing with the areas with which BlackAthena is.concerned, these historians' refusal to accept the infonnation contained in the number, spread and plausibility ofhistorical reports opened the door to the denial of the Ancient Model. The many ancient references to the Egyptian and Phoenician colonization and the later cultural borrowings could now be dismissed as 'late', 'credulous', or simply 'unreliable'. What is more, scholars could now use the facts that many ancient texts contradicted each other, or went against the newly established canons ofnatural science, to discredit anything they disliked. Nevertheless, the reason why the Model did not fall for another forty years is partly that it retained its formidable traditional hold on people's minds, and partly the fact that there were no ancient sources of good quality that challenged it. When the Ancient Model was overthrown, the new scholars were forced to rely on what they saw as the 'tacit dissent' and 'refutation by silence' of those ancient authors who, for whatever reasons, had failed to mention the colonizations.108 Despite the links between 'source criticism' and the new scientific spirit, it is important to note that the method did not arise in positivist France or empirical England but in Romantic Gennany. For example, Meiners himself used the new scholarly techniques to write 'progressive' Romantic histories of peoples whom he divided categorically into the white, courageous, free, etc., and the black, ugly, etc. The spectrum
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 219
ranged from chimpanzees through Hottentots and others to Gennans and Celts. 109 A more cautious and systematic racial hierarchy was established by J. F. Blumenbach, a professor of natural history at Gottingen. His De Generis Human; Varietate Nativa, published in 1775, was the first attempt at a 'scientific' study of human races of the type Linnaeus had written for natural history a few decades earlier. Blumenbach could not, however, apply Linnaeus' definition of a species, a population that can breed and produce fertile offspring, to human beings. He was not a progressive or a believer in polygenesis, the denial of the biblical tradition of a single creation of man and the assertion that different 'races' had been created separately. Blumenbach believed in a unique creation of a perfect man. In fact, Blumenbach's explanation for what he perceived as important 'racial' differences followed the Europocentric pattern set out earlier in the century by the naturalist Buffon. Buffon had argued that the normal type ofspecies found in Europe had degenerated in other continents because of unfortunate climatic conditions there: individuals· became too big, too small, too weak, too strong, too brighdy coloured, too drab, etc. 110 Blumenbach was the first to publicize the term 'Caucasian', which he used for the first time in the third edition of his great work in 1795. According to him the white or Caucasian was the first and most beautiful and talented race, from which all the others had degenerated to become Chinese, Negroes, etc. Blumenbach justified the curious name 'Caucasian' on 'scientific' and 'racial' grounds, since he believed the Georgians to be the finest 'white race'. However, there was much more to it than that. There was firsdy the religious belief - given publicity by Vico in the 18th century - that man could usefully be seen as coming after the Flood and, as everyone knew, that Noah's Ark had landed on Mount Ararat in the Southern Caucasus. 111 There was also the increasingly important German Romantic tendency to place the origins of mankind - and therefore of the Europeans - in Eastern Mountains, not in the river valleys of the Nile and Euphrates, as the Ancients had believed. As Herder put it: 'Let us scale the mountains laboriously to the summit of Asia.' Herder placed human origins in the Himalayas, while the general



220 BLACK ATHENA
beliefthat mankind - at least in its purest form, the Aryans - came from the highlands of Asia remained dominant in the Romantic search for origins until the end of the 19th century. HZ One advantage of the scheme ofAsiatic origins was that it placed Germans closer to the pure beginnings ofmankind than the West Europeans; this was, however, far more effectively exploited in the 19th century. Blumenbach was conventional for his period in that he included 'Semites' and 'Egyptians' among his Caucasians. However- although I have been unable to trace it precisely - it seems clear that there was already some sense in which the Caucasus was linked specifically to the Aryans, another new term that was coming into use from the 1790S.113 The Caucasus was the traditional site of the imprisonment and cruel punishment of Prometheus, who was considered the epitome of Europe. Not only was he the son of lapetos, plausibly identified as the biblical Japhet, third son of Noah and the ancestor of the but his heroic, beneficial and self-sacrificing action - ofstealing fire for mankind - soon came to be seen as typically Aryan. Gobineau saw him as the ancestor ofthe principal white family and by the 20th century the ultra-Romantic Robert Graves was even suggesting that the name Prometheus meant 'swastika'. 114
In the 1780s yet another Gottingen professor, A. L. Schlozer, tried to set up a 'Japhetic' linguistic family which included most of the languages later subsumed under the name Indo-European. He failed in this but succeeded in establishing a 'Semitic' one. IIS Semitic studies at Gottingen were, however, dominated by his teacher, J. D. Michaelis, who combined being the greatest Hebrew scholar ofhis day with strong anti-Semitism. I16
As must by now be clear, Gottingen, in the period from 1775 to 1800, not only established many ofthe institutional forms oflater universities, but its professors established much of the intellectual framework within which later research and publication within the new professional disciplines was carried out. In this very distinguished company, there is no doubt that the centre of the intellectual ferment was in Classical Philology, later to be given the more imposing and modem name Altertumswissenschaji or 'science of Antiquity'.117 The field was dominated by Christian Gottlob Heyne, who married
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 22 I
into the professorate of the town and was a brother-in-law of Blumenbach. From his appointment in 1763 to his death in 1812, Heyne was the central figure in both the town and the university. He ran the library, which rapidly became one ofthe best in Europe, and he was one of the chief proponents of 'modem' professional scholarship.IIB Heyne promoted the secular Seminar, taken from the Sokratic method, and source criticism was developed in this. Not surprisingly, one ofthe most frequent targets ofsource criticism was the Ancient Model and favourable references to Egypt in Greek texts. 119 Source criticism can helpfully be compared to the use of factor analysis in demography and the measurement of intelligence, about which Stephen Gould writes:
virtually all its procedures arose as justifications for particular theories of intelligence. Factor analysis, despite its status as pure deductive mathematics, was invented in a social context, and for definite reasons. And, though its mathematical basis is unassailable, its persistent use as a device for learning about the physical structure of the intellect has been mired in deep conceptual errors from the start. 1ZO
Heyne had known Winckelmann when he had been a young librarian at Dresden. As a 'professional' academic he made criticisms ofWinckelmann's writings, but there is no doubt that Heyne was heavily influenced by his passionate Neo-Hellenism. lzi As Rudolf Pfeiffer wrote:
It was precisely the influence ofWinckelmann that distinguished the scholarship of Heyne and his friends and pupils from that of other contemporary scholars.122
The contemporary historian ofscience Steven Turner enlarges on this point in his important work on the transformation of the traditional German erudits Gelehrte into 'professional' academics:
Through Heyne, Neo-Humanism had a similar invigorating effect upon Classical scholarship and its 'public image'. Throughout his career Heyne strove to forge new links between traditional



i !i
222 BLACK ATHENA
philological scholarship of the school and the academies and the currents of aesthetic Neo-Hellenism and Weimar Classicism building up outside academia.123
Heyne epitomized what one may usefully call 'Romantic Positivism'. As Frank Manuel has written about him:
His scholarship was impeccable, his editing of texts in the great tradition, but for all the appurtenances of learning, the spirit that animated him and generations of German Gelehrte was the same Romantic Hellenism which possessed his literary compatriots in the 18th century. 124
Heyne was fascinated by overseas travel and by exotic peoples. Given the importance, in German academic life, of marrying the professor's daughter, the fact that Blumenbach was his brother-in-law was less significant than the fact that both Heyne's sons-in-law were concerned with extra-European travel. One ofthem, Heeren, will be discussed in Chapter VI; the other, who was much better known in the 18th century, was Georg Forster. Forster had sailed with Captain Cook and wrote a description of sailing round the world. His political radicalism and his dislike of exploitation - even of non-Whites - went together with a refusal to discount the possibility of polygenesis. Heyne and Forster adored each other and they had an extensive correspondence, much of which was concerned with tropical climes and anthropology.125 Heyne was not particularly concerned about Christianity. However, when issues were polarized after 1789, he became passionately involved in preserving the status quo. His vehement denunciations ofthe French Revolution cannot be explained away simply as rage against Georg Forster, even though Forster had not merely gone to Paris to take part in the Revolution but had left his wife - Heyne's daughter - for the love of her best friend Caroline, the daughter ofthe Semitist Michaelis.126 The explanation for Heyne's fury also needs to be based on his profound involvement with the Hanoverian and German status quo, which is in no way diminished by his ability to work with the French occupying forces to protect his beloved university. Thus it is altogether appropriate that so many ofHeyne's students and followers should have
[CH. IV] HOSTILITIES TO EGYPT IN THE 18TH CENTURY 223
worked for Prussia in the struggle against France and revolutionary ideas. Altogether, it is clear that the acknowledged ancestor ofAltertumswissenschaft, later transposed to Britain and America as the new discipline of 'Classics', was a typical product of Gottingen - with its desire for reform rather than revolution, its profound concerns with ethnicity and race, and its exhaustive scholarship. Furthermore, both the ancestor and the discipline itself shared the reaction against the French Revolution and its challenge to traditional order and religion and the concern with the differences and inequalities between different races. They also shared the passionate Romanticism and NeoHellenism of progressive German circles of the late 18th century.

ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
The rise of India
and the fall ofEgypt, 1740-1880
W
E NOW TURN TO the fall of the Ancient Model which, although affected by a similar background and many of the same social and intellectual forces, should be distinguished from the rise ofthe Aryan Model some twenty years later. The chapter begins with the fascination of Sanskrit and other Indian languages that grew in the last quarter ofthe 18th century, and the impact this had on the understanding of relationships between European languages. By the 1830S this had led to a general perception of the Indo-European language family which, in the racist atmosphere of the time, developed quite quickly into the notion ofan Indo-European or 'Aryan race'. The passion for India also meant that it replaced Egypt as the exotic ancestor ofEurope. This time, however, the ancestry was not seen in terms ofthe transmission ofphilosophy and reason but as a Romantic one of,blood' and kinship. To return now to the Ancient Model. After the 1780s, the intensification of racism and the new belief in the central importance of 'ethnicity' as a principle of historical explanation became critical for perceptions of Ancient Egypt. The Egyptians were increasingly detached from the noble Caucasians, and their 'black' and African nature was more and more emphasized. Thus the idea that they were the
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 225
cultural ancestors of the Greeks - the epitome and pure childhood of Europe - became unbearable. There was also a new crisis between Egyptian mythology and Christianity with the works of Dupuis, which represented the ideological or theological counterpart of the French Revolution's attack on European social order. It is only with this background that one can make sense of the tormented career of Champollion during the years of reaction between 1815 and 1830. Although Champollion was an avowed revolutionary and an enthusiastic Bonapartist, one ofhis earliest discoveries discredited some ofthe theories of Dupuis's supporters, and he and his decipherment were therefore welcomed by the Church and the Restoration nobility. On the other hand, his championing of Egypt over Greece combined with his political beliefs to infuriate Hellenist and Indianist scholars, who continued to do all they could to block his academic career. Just before his premature death in 1831, Champollion challenged Christian orthodoxy by his high dating of Egyptian Antiquity. Thus by the time of his death he had antagonized both Christians and Hellenists, and Egyptology, despite a popular fascination with Egypt as well as some continuation of the Masonic respect for it, went into a sharp decline for the next twenty-five years. Its slow recovery began only in the late 1850s. Between 1860 and 1880 there was a period of tension between the spirit of Champollion and the prevailing racism and the passion for Greece; after 1880, however, Egyptology tended to conform . and subordinate itselfto the dominant discipline of Classics. Since then, there have always been some discordant voices and claims that Egyptian civilization really had possessed at least some ofthe high religion, philosophy and science claimed for it by the Ancients. Nevertheless, the predominant view has been maintained that although the Egyptians were technically proficient they were not 'truly civilized', and the Greek respect for their culture was based on delusion. The discrepancies between this 'official line' and the surviving monuments and the ancient reports has led to the emergence of a number of counter-cultures or counter-disciplines.
Two of these are discussed at the end of the chapter: the first is the theory of'diffusionism' promoted by the anatomist and physical anthropologist Elliot Smith, according to which Asian immigrants had



226 BLACK ATHENA
established Egyptian civilization and spread it to Europe and the rest of the world. The second is the school of 'pyramidologists', the more cautious members of which maintain that the Great Pyramids were built according to the plans of architects with a very sophisticated understanding of astronomy and mathematics. The chapter ends with a discussion of the possibilities of a future meeting between these 'heresies' and orthodox Egyptology.
THE BIRTH OF INDO-EuROPEAN
Language has always been a central concern to Romantics. According to them, languages are peculiar - that is, they are attached to a particular place, landscape and climate. They are therefore seen as the individual expression of a specific people, to be treasured as such. Herder was obsessed by language, and especially by speech. Following the English enthusiasm for Homer, Blackwell and the German mystic philosopher Hamann, Herder denied the priority ofthought and reason over words; in this way he opposed the Enlightenment predilection for visual signs, Egyptian hieroglyphics or Chinese characters, which were thought to express universal ideas untrammelled by particular phonetics. For Herder and the Romantics, the chief purpose of language was not to transmit reason but to express feeling, and it was for this that both German and Greek were admired. As we have seen, Greek was valued in the mid- I 8th century not as a vehicle ofphilosophy but for its poetic qualities. 1 This concern with language on the part of Herder and the other Romantics was important in the formation of historical philology. Furthermore, Romantic influence can be seen in the discipline's two chief models - the tree and the family - which, with their enormous aesthetic and progressive appeal, became widely popular throughout 19th-century scholarship and science. In historical linguistics, the assumptions ofsimple beginnings and later ramification and divergence - through regular, though specific, shifts that can be charted - proved extremely useful in the early stages of the new discipline. On the other hand, the tree and the family do not allow for 'backtracking' or mixing and convergence and they have a tendency to teleology, the assumption
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 227
that each language has an ultimate nature inbuilt in its beginnings which are not fundamentally affected by later contacts.2 Anticipating discussion in Chapters VII and VIII, we can just note here that it was largely for these reasons that historical philology was moribund by the end ofthe 19th century. Before this, however, philology was one ofthe most exciting areas of intellectual life. SchlOzer's establishment of the Semitic language family has already been mentioned, in connection with both the work of the Abbe Barthelemy and developments at Gottingen. By 1820, scholars - notably the Dane Christian Rask and Herder's disciple Franz Bopp - had systematically traced the relationships between the phonetics and morphology ofmost European languages.3 This endeavour was clearly related to the new systematic racial taxonomy. As the Caucasians had come from Asian mountains, the European languages were supposed to have had the same origin. It is significant that, just as the Germans were supposed to be purer Caucasians because they were the latest to leave the Urheimat or original homeland, German was thought to be purer and more ancient than other languages in the family. Hence the German name for the newly defined language family became Indogermanisch (IndoGermanic) - a term coined by the German Indianist H. J. Klaproth in 1823.4 Franz Bopp himself, however, sided with scholars from other countries who preferred 'Indo-European', a title first used by Thomas Young in 1816.5
THE LOVE AFFAIR
WITH SANSKRIT
The 'Indo-' was linked to the new passion for India and for Sanskrit. In his fascinating book The Oriental Renaissance, first published in 1950, the earlY-20th-century French intellectual Raymond Schwab traced the growing interest in ancient Indian and Iranian cultures and languages that accompanied French and British penetration of the subcontinent. As with so many 19th-century artistic and intellectual developments, the first man to introduce the idea of an 'Oriental Renaissance' was the linguist and ardent Romantic Friedrich



BLACK ATHENA
Schlegel. In The Speech and Wisdom of the Indians, Schlegel wrote that
The study of Indian Literature requires to be embraced by such students and patrons as in the 15th and 16th centuries suddenly kindled in Italy and Germany an ardent appreciation ofthe beauty of Classical learning, and in so short a time invested it with such prevailing importance that the form of all wisdom and science, and almost of the world itself, was changed and renovated by the influence of that reawakened knowledge.6
Schwab's title, The Oriental Renaissance, is that of a chapter heading from a book by Edgar Quinet published in 1841. Quinet and, later, Schwab had two very similar bases. The first was the claim that the new Orientalism had overtaken Neoclassicism.7 A modification ofthis - the claim that Orientalism, in alliance with was surpassing Classicism - was a possible, though not very plausible, view in the I 840S. With the triumph ofGreece and Rome and the abandonment of ancient India at the end of the 19th century, however, it became completely untenable and its revival by Schwab is merely antiquarian. The second concept behind the Oriental Renaissance belongs to the category of the myths of the history of science in which heroic men create light, order and science out of darkness, confusion and superstition. It assumes that before the Romantic age men and women did not know, or even care, about 'the Orient', and that it was first discooered in the late 18th century. It is true that Egypt, during the Enlightenment, was sometimes thought ofas belonging to the West and not the Orient.8 On the other hand, as I have tried to show in earlier chapters, there was intense interest in Egypt and in China, and considerable knowledge about them, well before 1750. Though less central to the concerns of Enlightenment thinkers than Egypt and China, even India was known about in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The Indian Brahmins were less admired than the Egyptian priests or the Chinese literati, but they were in some ways their functional equivalents in the general criticism of European institutions and religion. Indian scholars had, of course, always known their Classical language, Sanskrit, and there had been knowledge of it in the West since
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 229
the late 17th century.9 With this came the general impression, explicitly stated by Sir William Jones in 1786, that Sanskrit, in relation to Greek and Latin,
bears a stronger affinity, both in the roots ofverbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong, indeed, that no philologer could examine all three without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which perhaps no longer exists; there is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanskrit. lO
19th-century German and British scholars rejected the idea that their languages could be the result ofimpure mixture. Apart from that, however, this admirable and concise statement - which, it should be noted, is based on plausibility - has been the basis of Indo-European and all other historical philology ever since. The linguistic relationship meant that Indian language and culture could now be seen as both exotic and familiar, ifnot ancestral. This idea came about because, despite Jones' prudence on the subject - he argued that Sanskrit and the European languages probably had a common unknown ancestor - it was generally thought that Sanskrit itself was the original Indo-European language. This tie - and the knowledge, through the Indian tradition, that the Brahmins were the descendants of 'Aryan' conquerors who had come from the highlands of Central Asia - fitted wonderfully with the German Romantic belief that mankind and the Caucasians had originated in the mountains of Central Asia. I I This was a great force behind the extraordinary enthusiasm for all aspects of Indian culture that raged from the I 790S to the 1820S. In the short run, however, Jones had an even greater impact through literature than through linguistics, and his translations of Indian poetry were received rapturously all over Europe. 12 The English Lake poets were all moved by Indian poetry, while in 1791 Goethe wrote: 'When I mention Shakuntala [an Indian poem translated by Jones] everything is said.,13 It will be remembered, too, that in 1798 Napoleon had a copy ofthe Vedas with him on his Expedition to Egypt. 14

The academic results of this enthusiasm were the establishment of many chairs ofSanskrit and the creation ofa disciplinary base which, in alliance with Germanic studies as Indogermanisch, could threaten the monopoly of Latin and Greek as the only ancient languages.IS This is not to say that Sanskrit and Germanic studies were a serious challenge to the latter, though some scholars, like K. O. Muller in the 1820S and Salomon Reinach in the I 890s, perceived them as such. 16 To begin with, the new academic studies were centred in Britain and France, both of whom had colonial interests in India. However, the British effort soon faded, and even the French study of Sanskrit and ancient India was overwhelmed by the German Romantic response to them. The dominant figures in this were Friedrich von Schlegel and his brother Wilhelm, who became the first Professor of Sanskrit at Bonn. Even a less passionate man like Wilhelm von Humboldt thanked God for having allowed him to live long enough to acquainted with the Bhago:vad Gita. I7
SCHLEGELIAN
ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
Twenty years earlier, in 1803, Friedrich Schlegel's passion for India had been even less restrained: 'Everything, absolutely everything, is of Indian origin.,18 Schlegel was also the first to insist, against the biblical tradition of the Tower of Babel and most later thinkers, on linguistic polygenesis. Specifically, he argued that there was a categorical distinction between the Indo-European family and other languages, and he attacked William Jones and his contemporaries for having seen relationships between Indian and Semitic languages. 19 Although he did not spell it out, the concept ofan Aryan race can also be traced back to Schlegel. His Romantic passion and conviction ofthe superiority of the Ancient Indian Race were sufficient to surmount the total lack of evidence and provide a simple answer to what had now become 'the Egyptian problem': how could Mricans have produced such a high civilization? According to Schlegel, the answer lay in the fact that Egypt had been colonized and civilized by Indians. So confident was he of this scheme that he cited the magnificence of Egyptian
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 23 1
architecture as proofof the greatness of the Indian race.20 This notion of Egypt's Indian origin was to remain powerful throughout the 19th century, and we will encounter it again in Gobineau. Despite his interest in race, Schlegel never lost sight ofthe centrality of language. He distinguished between two kinds of language - the 'noble', inflected languages, and the less perfect ones that were not inflected. The former had a spiritual origin, while the latter were originally 'animal,.21 Only with the inflection of the Indian-based
languages, he believed, could there be clear and penetrating intelligence or high and universal thought.22 Somewhat surprisingly, Schlegel did not get high marks from the Nazis. The reasons for this were that he was not anti-SeInitic in his political views - he advocated Jewish emancipation - or personally, in that he married the daughter of the famous Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelsohn.23 He also praised the 'lofty power and energy of the Arabic and Hebraic languages'. But, he continued, 'they indeed stand on the loftiest point of their particular branch.,24 At times he even maintained that they were hybrids between the 'spiritual' and 'animal' languages.2s This, however, did not save them from their position in the lower category. Schlegel also supposed that Jewish culture had been influenced by the Egyptians - who, you will recall, had received their high civilization from the Indians.26 Furthermore, as Friedrich Schlegel was one of the first men to link language to race, his views on the polygenesis of language were clearly linked to contemporary attitudes to the polygenesis of man.27 By paving the way for the Aryan and Semitic races, Schlegel was definitely ahead ofhis time. These ideas were not taken up seriously for another forty or fifty years: externally, the forces ofracial anti-SeInitism were still not strong enough, while internally, there was a great inconsistency in his approach.28 Schlegel insisted that there was a categorical distinction between affixing - the external addition of suffixes or other particles to a word - and inflection, in which the 'root' was modified internally in what he saw as an organic way.29 Unfortunately for Indo-European superiority, the SeInitic languages are modified in precisely this way, and the term 'root' itse1fis taken from Hebrew grammar.30 Thus later scholars were obliged to place Semitic along



23 2 BLACK ATHENA
with Indo-European in the top rank. At the same time the suggestion made by Barthelemy in the 1760s, that there was a fundamental and exclusive relationship between the 'Phoenician' and Coptic languages, was seldom taken up seriously in the 19th century. Further, the idea ofa Semito-Hamitic or Afroasiatic linguistic 'superfamily', including Semitic and Egyptian and other Mrican languages, was not generally accepted until after the Second World War.31 The other great modification of Schlegel's scheme made by mid19th-century linguists was on the matter of 'progress'. He played an important role in transforming philology from being the history of languages into becoming the interpretation oflanguage as a force in the making of history. He also partially incorporated 'progress' into his thinking. Nevertheless, Schlegel's views were old-fashioned in that he saw the 'spiritual' Indian languages as regressive. That is to say, having been formed as perfect, they had undergone more or less decay. Among the 'animal' languages, on the other hand, there was 'progress' as they became more complex.32 Here, too, later scholars who were more thoroughly steeped in the 'progressive' paradigm had to modify his ideas and explain superiority and inferiority of languages in terms of their relative places in evolution. English and French scholars were equally confident that IndoEuropean languages were superior to any others. However, as they themselves spoke languages with relatively little inflection, they did not show much enthusiasm for Schlegel's ideas in this area, with their implication that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and German were the only languages suitable for philosophy and religion. By contrast - and despite the modifications mentioned above - German scholars shared or accepted his new scheme. Wilhelm von Humboldt, for example, tended to see a progress from affixing or agglutinative languages to inflected ones, and he too saw the differences between the two as categorical.33
Wilhelm von Humboldt was a wide-ranging genius who established, among many other things, the bases for both Basque and MalayoPolynesian linguistics. Nevertheless, as has already been mentioned, he had a passion of a different order for Sanskrit. For instance, he thought that with its massive and intricate inflection, Sanskrit was a far better
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 233
language than Chinese, which is 'isolating' and has even less inflection than English. In his brilliant essay on Chinese written in the 1820S, Humboldt was forced to admit that, despite its unmodified words, Chinese was the equal to the best Indo-European languages as a vehicle of logical thought.34 On the other hand, he maintained that its lack of inflection 'prevented the free soaring of thought', which needed grammatical forms to guide it.35 Thus not merely was the Chinese script static, but the spoken language itselfwas seen to lack the full emotional power now demanded oflanguage by German Romantics. Presumably because of their own languages' lack of inflection, English and French Romantics do not seem to have made this point. The equation of inflection with freedom neatly epitomized the distinction perceived by the Romantics between the rigid Sinophilia of the Enlightenment and their own free love for their Indian kin.36 By the 1820S, even his limited admiration for Chinese and his studies of other non-Indo-European languages marked Humboldt out as a member of the older generation. Younger men cut off from the Enlightenment were more rigorous: they were almost exclusively concerned with Indo-European.
THE ORIENTAL RENAISSANCE
Quinet and Schwab claimed that this breakthrough in Indian studies was only the centre ofa general 'Oriental Renaissance' - which Schwab rightly sees as integrally linked to Romanticism - and they linked this movement to the great decipherments of the 19th century.37 It is true that the decipherment of cuneiform was begun in 1800 by the Gottingen Romantic scholar G. F. Grotefend by reading the names of Persian kings, but I will try to show in this chapter that the much more impressive decipherment ofhieroglyphics came not from Romanticism and the Oriental Renaissance but largely from the Egypto-Masonic tradition and the scientific spirit ofthe French Revolution.38 Schwab's claim that the Oriental Renaissance was linked to the establishment of 'Orientalism' as an academic discipline, on the other hand, does seem partly justified. Arabic, having been a language ofhigh culture in Early Medieval Europe, had been taught there from time to



234 BLACK ATHENA
time ever since. However, its regular position as a modern academic study was established in 1799 with the appointment ofSylvestre de Sacy as the first teacher in the newly founded Ecole de Langues Orientales Vivantes, in a move that was associated with the Expedition to Egypt. There is no doubt that de Sacy, both as a teacher of the new aracane Orientalism and as a supporter of the monarchy, fits the Romantic and conservative pattern of the Oriental Renaissance very well.39 While France needed Arabic, both for the Egyptian Expedition and for the conquest of Algeria which began in 1830, Germany did not, and there was very little interest in Arabic in that country. Furthermore, as Edward Said has pointed out, Orientalism inherited much of the traditional hatred of Islam as the enemy of Christendom.40 In this context, it is important to note that the 1820S, a crucial decade in the formation of Orientalism, were dominated by the Greek War of Independence between Christian Greeks and, MosYem Turks and Egyptians. There were, however, religious and linguistic senses in which the Semitic cultures were considered to be if not the equals, at least on the same plane as those of the Aryans (see Chapter VII). The Oriental Renaissance did not include China. ManyJesuits had known Chinese well since the 16th century and by the tum ofthe 18th, through their translations and scores of travellers' reports, Europeans knew about China in some detail.41 The language had been taught intermittently at Paris since then, but it was only in the late 19th century that regular chairs were established elsewhere in Europe. It is particularly striking that while the first chair of Sanskrit was established at Berlin in 18 I 8, Chinese studies remained in a parlous state in Germany until the end of the century. As a French Sinologue wrote in 1898: 'Germany and Austria have not occupied in Sinology the brilliant place that belongs to them in some branches of Oriental studies.'42
Although German scholars came to dominate Egyptology after the 1880s, in the period of the Oriental Renaissance the mainstream of German academics would have nothing to do with the new discipline. The French Orientalists' hostility towards Champollion will be described below. Here, it is sufficient to point out that Raymond Schwab calls one ofhis sections 'The Prejudice for Egypt' and writes in it: 'This
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 235
view of Egypt as the first and the essential Oriental influence on the West is totally erroneous. In point offact, the Egypt ofthe scholars was a relative latecomer, arriving only in the 19th century.,43 In a footnote Schwab makes it clear that what he means by this is that 'the I 9thcentury infatuation with Egypt replaced its infatuation with India.,44 These statements are misleading in so many directions· that it is difficult to know where to begin. First there was the Orientalists' hostility to Egypt and the slowness ofthe establishment of Egyptology. Secondly, as we have seen, Egypt had been perceived as 'the essential Oriental influence on the West' since Antiquity, far longer than there had been any comparable interest in India. Thirdly, although there was considerable curiosity about Egypt in the first half of the 19th century, the country was seen then as exotic and alien - that is to say, very differently from Egypt's earlier position as the ancestral culture of Europe. It was precisely from the latter niche that it was replaced by the Romantic view of India. All in all, it is clear that academic Orientalism, most strikingly in Germany but elsewhere as well, began with quite definite limits. The only regions of the Orient for which the early Orientalists showed respect were Central Asia, seen as the mountainous European Urheimat, and India, seen as the home of kin from whom Europeans could learn about themselves. By the end of the 19th century, even the respect for these had disappeared. Edward Said and R. Rashed have shown that Orientalism, at a fundamental level and from the beginning, has combined interest in Asian societies with a contempt for them and the conviction that 'Orientals' were unfit to analyse and arrange their own cultures.45 Orientalist scholars concurrently tried to emphasize the ancient civilizations of other continents, and to play down their medieval and modem continuations and developments.46 Other ancient civilizations could be completely appropriated by Western scholarship because the modern inhabitants, it was argued, were either new interlopers themselves or, in their decadence, had 'lost' the high culture of their ancestors. The later civilizations, which could not be taken over in this way, were dismissed and ignored - even though, in nearly every case, the Europeans had been able to learn about the ancient ones only



'I
BLACK ATHENA
through them.47 It was asserted above all, and despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that only Europeans had a true sense of history!S
There is no doubt about the extraordinary efforts of the early Orientalists, and of their great and lasting achievements. Nevertheless, the growth of Orientalism did not simply go with a broadening of horizons, as Quinet and Schwab claimed. In many respects it involved a narrowing of the imagination and intensified feelings of the innate and categorical superiority ofEuropean civilization. It has served to distance and objectify non-European cultures, lumping their very different characteristics into a general category of'Oriental' merely because they are not European. These have been seen as 'exotic', and viewed as inert or passive in the face of European dynamism. Indeed, since the 19th century it has become literally unthinkable to Europeans that peoples of any other continent could be 'scientific' in the waythey themselves are, or that Asians or Africans could have contributed in any profound way to the making of Europe.49 The only apparent exceptions here were ancient Iran and India, but these, of course, were seen as part of the Indo-European family. As such they filled the niche of 'exotic ancestors' that had previously been occupied by Egypt and Chaldaea. Gobineau, for instance, was sure that 'the nations ofEgypt and Assyria took a place behind the men of Hindustan.,50 Naturally, the institutional rise of Orientalism must - at least in England and France - be associated with the huge expansion of colonialism and other forms of domination over Asia and Africa taking place at the same time. Not only was a systematic understanding of non-European peoples and their spoken languages needed to control these peoples but a knowledge of their civilizations, by seizing and categorizing their cultures, ensured that the natives themselves could learn about their own civilizations only through European scholarship. This provided yet another rope to tie the colonial elites to the metropolitan countries, which has been an increasingly important factor in the retention ofEuropean cultural hegemony since the decline ofdirect colonialism in the second halfof the 20th century.51 Raymond Schwab has brilliantly shown how frequently OrientalRomantic themes appear in 19th-century culture. His implication,
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 237
however, that this was a new phenomenon in European art is entirely misleading. Interest in other continents long antedates the I 8thcentury enthusiasms for Egypt, Abyssinia and China described above. Furthermore, the establishment of arcane Orientalist academic disciplines in the 19th century relieved the cultured generalist of the distasteful duty of coming to grips with Oriental civilizations and treating them with respect. Unlike the 17th- and 18th-century artists and politicians, who took Egypt and China very seriously indeed, those of the 19th could simply collect china or introduce exotic romantic themes into their literature and art. These intellectual and educational changes can be related to specific national configurations of European colonization and expansion into other continents. For instance, the initial development of ancient Indian studies in the 17th and 18th centuries grew out ofthe East India Company's need to understand their subjects and 'native' allies. It is equally significant that the romanticizing of India was carried out by Germans, who had no direct interest in the subcontinent. Even in England the dOIninant Indianist of the second half of the 19th century was Max-Muller, who was appointed at the instigation of the . Prussian ambassador Baron Christian Bunsen and who remained very German throughout his fifty years as Professor of Indian Languages at Oxford.52
THE FALL OF CHINA
The historiographic fall of Indian culture, like that of the ancient Semites, took place only at the end of the 19th century. Here we are concerned with the beginning ofthe century and the degradation ofthe Chinese and the Egyptians. The complete triumph of racism and 'progress' and the Romantic 'return' to Europe and Christianity took place as European manufacturers began to replace Chinese luxury goods such as furniture, porcelain and silk with their own products. Europe's gain from this was not merely cultural satisfaction. As Britain began to penetrate the Chinese market with Lancashire cottons and Indian opium the balance of trade tipped against China, and Europe's commercial advantage was soon followed by military initiatives.



BLACK ATHENA
From 1839 - when the British went to war to protect their opium trade from an official Chinese ban - until the end of the century, Britain, France and the other 'powers' made successive attacks on China to extract more and greater concessions. The need to justify these actions and exploitation, the real social breakdown in China itselflargely the result ofEuropean pressure - together with the general racism and 'return to Europe', were the forces that led to a transformation of the Western image of China. From being a model of rational civilization China became seen as a filthy country in which torture and corruption of all sorts flourished. With obscene irony, the Chinese were especially blamed for their consumption of opium. De Tocqueville, writing in the 1850s, found it incomprehensible that the 18th-century Physiocrats should have had such an admiration for China. 53 The fall in China's reputation can also be traee4 in linguistics. As an isolating language, Chinese - together with Coptic and to some extent even English - was difficult for Humboldt to fit into his evolutionary progress from agglutinative to inflected languages. He toyed with, but rejected, the idea that Chinese was a baby talk and therefore the language of the babyhood of mankind.54 By the middle of the century men like the great Indo-European linguist August Schleicher had no such qualms. Schleicher saw a three-stage evolutionary hierarchy from isolating Chinese, to agglutinative Turanian (Turkish and Mongol), culminating in inflected Semitic and Indo-European.55 Baron Christian Bunsen, whose ambivalence about Egypt was agonized, had no hesitation about the linguistic and hence the historical position of Chinese. According to him, Sinism (China) was the most primitive stage in world history; it was followed by Turanism and then Khamism (Egypt). After that came the Flood and the beginning of true history, which consisted of the dialectic between the Semites and the Indo-Germans.56 Thus, on the 'scientific' basis ofhistorical linguistics, both Egypt and China were kicked out of history into the antediluvian past. As I have stressed, relations between race and language were extremely close during the 19th century. Thus the fall in the linguistic position of Egypt and China was paralleled by one in their anatomical and racial one.
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 239
RACISM IN THE
EARLY 19TH CENTURY
The extraordinary growth of racism in the early 19th century included the increasingly pejorative 'racial' classifications of the Chinese and Egyptians. With the reaction to the French Revolution and the revival of Christianity, one key area of doctrine in which Christianity was not able to restore its position was on the unity of mankind. Even polygenesis somewhat revived after a setback in the Evangelical I 820S, while the period from 1800 to 1850 in general was one of intense activity to find anatomical bases for the racial differences which every cultivated European 'knew' existed.57 The lack ofclear-cut results ofthis research did not affect general opinion on the matter; it may, however, have been a factor in making a number of more cautious scholars continue to use language to explain what they saw as the obvious inequalities between different peoples. Whatever form it took, the new principle of ethnicity pervaded all areas oflife and scholarship.58
A Renaissance traveller, Andrea Corsalis, described the Chinese as 'of our quality'.59 For the most part, 17th- and 18th-century writers considered them to belong to a distinct but not necessarily inferior race.60 By the period of the Opium Wars in the middle of the 19th century, however, the Chinese were racially contemptible. As a jingle published in Punch put it in 1858:
John Chinaman a rogue is born, The laws of truth he holds in scorn; About as great a brute as can Encumber the earth isJohn Chinaman. Sing Yeh, my cruel John Chinaman, Sing Yeo, my stubbornJohn Chinaman. Not Cobden himself can take off the ban By humanity laid onJohn Chinaman.
With their little pig-eyes and their large pig-tails, And their diet ofrats, dogs, slugs and snails, All seems to be game in the frying pan Ofthat nasty feeder John Chinaman.



BLACK ATHENA
Sing lie-tea, my sly Chinaman, No fightee, my coward John Chinaman, John Bull has a chance -let him, if he can Somewhat open the eyes ofJohn Chinaman.61
19th-century scholars were only slightly less damning. However many divisions of humanity the new anthropologists envisioned, the 'yellow' races came out in the middle, below the white and above the black. What is more, the Chinese were now condemned for what the Enlightenment had considered admirable, their stability. According to Baron Cuvier, the great naturalist ofthe early part ofthe century: 'This race has formed mighty empires in China and Japan ... but its civilization has long appeared stationary.,62 For the racist pioneer the
Comte de Gobineau, the yellow tribes
have little physical vigour and tend towards ... feeble desires, a will that is obstinate rather than extreme ... In everything they tend to mediocrity. They have an easy enough understanding of what is not too elevated or too profound . . . The Yellows are a practical people in the strict sense of the word. They do not dream or enjoy theories. They invent little, but they are capable of appreciating and adopting what they can use ...63
It should be remembered that Gobineau became notorious only as an antecedent of Hitler; during the 19th century, although some might disagree with him, he was accepted as an eccentric but reputable scholar. The new racial position of the Chinese was quite sufficient to exclude them from the Romantic picture ofdynamic world history, and there was no doubt in anyone's mind that racially the 'Chinaman' was mediocre.
WHAT COLOUR WERE THE
ANCIENT EGYPTIANS?
The racial position ofthe Ancient Egyptians was much more precarious than that of the Chinese for two reasons: scholars differed greatly on their 'race', and the Egyptians themselves were balanced between the white acme ofmankind and its black pit. For Cuvier,
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
The Negro race . . . is marked by black complexion, crisped or woolly hair, compressed cranium and a flat nose. The projection of the lower parts ofthe face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state ofbarbarism.64
While for Gobineau,
The black variety is the lowest and lies at the bottom of the ladder. The animal character lent to its basic form imposes its destiny from the moment of conception. It never leaves the most restricted intellectual zones ... Ifits faculties for thinking are mediocre or even nonexistent, it possesses in its desire and as a consequence in its will an intensity that is often terrible. Many of the senses. are developed with a vigour unknown in the other two races: principally taste and smell. It is precisely in the greed for sensations that the most striking mark ofits inferiority is found ...65
If Europeans were treating Blacks as badly as they did throughout the 19th century, Blacks had to be turned into animals or, at best, subhumans; the noble Caucasian was incapable of treating other full humans in such ways. This inversion sets the scene for the racial and main aspect ofthe 'Egyptian problem': Ifit had been scientifically 'pruved' that Blacks were biologically incapable ofcivilization, how could one explain Ancient Egypt - which was inconveniently placed on theAfrican continent.1>6 There were two, or rather, three solutions. The first was to deny that the Ancient Egyptians were black; the second was to deny that the Ancient Egyptians had created a 'true' civilization; the third was to make doubly sure by denying both. The last has been preferred by most 19th- and 20th-century historians.
To what 'race', then, did the Ancient Egyptians belong? I am very dubious of the utility of the concept 'race' in general because it is impossible to achieve any anatomical precision on the subject. Moreover, even if one accepts it for the sake of argument, I am even more sceptical about the possibility of finding an answer in this particular case. Research on the question usually reveals far more about the predisposition of the researcher than about the question itself. Never



BLACK ATHENA
theless I am convinced that, at least for the last 7,000 years, the population of Egypt has contained African, South-West Asian and Mediterranean types. It is also clear that the further south, or up the Nile, one goes, the blacker and more Negroid the population becomes, and that this has been the case for the same length oftime. As I stated in the Introduction, I believe that Egyptian civilization was fundamentally African and that the African element was stronger in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, before the Hyksos invasion, than it later became. Furthermore, I am convinced that many of the most powerful Egyptian dynasties which were based in Upper Egypt - the 1st, IIth, 12th and 18th - were made up of pharaohs whom one can usefully- call black.67 (
The actual African nature of Egyptian civilization, however, is not relevant to our present discussion, which is concerned with the ambiguities in the perceived 'racial' position of the Egyptians. In Classical times the Egyptians were seen as both black and white or yellow; Herodotos referred to them as having 'black skins and woolly hair'.68 On the other hand, portraits of Bousiris on vases tend to show him as Caucasian, though he has black as well as white attendants.69 Professor Jean Devisse has expressed surprise at how many Blacks there appear to have been in early Christian portrayals of Egyptians.70 He has also shown how the Egyptians were 'blackened' in the 15th century, when they were very much admired. There also appears to have been a relation between blackness and Egyptian wisdom. Many medieval and Renaissance paintings portray one ofthe magi - presumably an Egyptian - as a Black.71 On the other hand, representations of Hermes Trismegistos from the Renaissance picture him as a European, though sometimes with vaguely Oriental features. 72 In England, the fact that the name Gypsy (or Egyptian) was given to people from North-West India shows that in the 15th century the Egyptians were seen as an archetypally dark people.73 The Talmudic interpretation that 'the curse of Ham' (the father of Canaan and Mizraim, 'Egypt') was blackness was widespread in the 17th century.74 On the other hand, with the late-17th-century combination of increased racism and growing respect for the Ancient Egyptians, their image tended to be whitened.

Earth by the Different Species or Races who Inhabit it, published in 1684, maintained that the Egyptians were part of the White Race.75 There is little doubt that many Masons have been racist. The facts that they were directly or indirectly involved with the slave trade and were less tied to monogenesis than orthodox Christians tended to override their anthropocentric tradition and the Masonic tenet that 'all mankind are brothers plighted'. With their focus on Egypt, they needed to make a drastic separation between the 'animal' Blacks and the noble Egyptians. In The Magic Flute, for instance, Mozart made a striking contrast between the lustful Moor Monostatos and the Egyptian philosopher Sarastro.76 Indeed, if we note the stress on the benefits of Egyptian colonization, which was a central theme of Sethos, and the stark contrasts drawn in it and in many other 18th-century writings between the 'acorn-eating' Pelasgians before the Egyptians' arrival and the glories ofGreek civilization after it, we can suggest that these were, to some extent at least, justifications of contemporary European
activities. In the second half of the 18th century, however, there were also tendencies to pull the Egyptians back to Africa, tendencies linked to an enthusiasm for Ethiopia reflected in Dr Johnson's translation of the 17th-century travels of Father Lobo in that country and his novel Rasselas.77 Although the medieval legend of the Kingdom of Prester John, Europe's Christian ally beyond Islam, had been applied to various regions ofAsia and Mrica, Ethiopia as an exotic, remote mountain and Christian kingdom was an admirable candidate. Furthermore, Ethiopia could very plausibly be linked to Ancient Egypt. It should, however, be made clear that the name 'Abyssinia' was used precisely to avoid 'Ethiopia', with its indelible associations with blackness. The first American edition of Johnson's work, published in Philadelphia in 1768, was entitled The History of Rasselas Prince of Abissinia:AnAsiatic Tale! Baron Cuvier equated Ethiopian with Negro, but categorized the Abyssinians - as Arabian colonies - as Caucasians.78 Nevertheless, this was too fine a distinction to be effective. The great Scottish explorerJames Bruce, who was inspired by the vision of Abyssinia/Ethiopia and the quest for the sources of the Nile, learnt better. For him the inhabitants ofthe Ethiopian mountains were

BLACK ATHENA
black and - on the whole - beautiful. His fascinating discoveries encouraged admirers of Egypt like Bruce himself, the traveller and savant the Comte de Volney, Dupuis and Champollion to stress the
importance ofUpper Egypt or even Ethiopia as the sources of Egyptian civilization.79
Despite its obvious Romantic charm, Germans did not get swept up in the Ethiopian craze. Their extra-European fantasies were always fixed on Asia, and when they linked Egypt to black Africa it was to denigrate it. Winckelmann's dislike ofthe appearance ofthe Egyptians has been mentioned; the following quotation illustrates how damning he believed an Mrican connection could be to Egypt:
How can one find even a hint of beauty in their figures, all or almost all of the originals on which they were based had the form of the African? That is they had, like them, pouting lips, receding and small chins, sunken and flattened profiles. And not only like the African but also like the Ethiopian, they often had flattened noses and a dark cast of skin ... Thus all of the figures painted on the mummies had dark brown faces.8o
Similar attitudes were held in England and France. Charles de Brosses, for instance, writing at almost the same time as Wickelmann, argued that the Ancient Egyptians resembled contemporary Blacks in that their zoolatry - which the Masons, following a tradition at least as old as Plutarch, saw as allegorical- was simply 'Negro fetishism'. 81 Nevertheless, at the end of the 18th century the predominant view was that of Mozart and his librettist Emanuel Schikaneder in The Magic Flute: that the Egyptians were neither Negro nor essentially African. Similarly Herder, with his great admiration for the East, saw them as an Asian people.82 The anthropologist and pioneer of racial studies Lord Monboddo, who is famous for having included the orangutan with humankind, had a great admiration for the Egyptians.83 Blumenbach placed the Egyptians, together with the Arabs and Jews, as members of the Caucasian race.84 A few decades later, Cuvier saw them as 'probably' white.
The dominant Ethiopian languages are Semitic, and it seems to have been on these grounds that the position ofthe Abyssinians as members
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 245
of the superior race was actually more secure than that of the Egyptians.85 With the huge increase of pictorial representations of Ancient Egyptians available to Europeans during the first half of the 19th century, which showed them to have been a thoroughly mixed population, the Egyptians tended to be seen as increasingly African and
black. By the middle ofthe 19th century, Gobineau was reviving the biblical - or to be more precise, the Talmudic - scheme, and categorizing the Egyptians as Hamites and virtually black. He thus found it useful to accept Schlegel's theory that Egyptian 'civilization' - to the extent that Gobineau conceded that it had existed - derived from the implantation of Indian 'Aryan' colonists.86 Before then, two compromises between the blackness of the Egyptians and their high civilization were reached, with the help ofthe long stretches oftime seen to be involved. The first was the same as that generally agreed for India - that the original 'pure' Egyptians had been white but that there had later been considerable mixture from other races, and this mixture or miscegenation had been the major cause oftheir decadence.87 The second compromise, advanced by the early- 19th-century anthropologist W. C. Wells, was just the opposite. Wells was linked to the humanitarian movement and opposed extreme racism and polygenesis, and he argued for the improvement of the black race. While he accepted the correlation between colour and degree of civilization, he maintained that it tended to be civilization that determined colour, rather than the other way round. He noted, for instance, that Ancient Egyptian art showed people who were clearly Negroid, yet the modem Egyptians were not Negroes. Thus, he argued, it was possible that their skins had become lighter with the advance of civilization.88 Wells, writing in 1818, shows how completely the intellectual atmosphere had changed since the Enlightenment. The notion of a higher Ancient Egyptian civilization was dismissed in the face of a completely triumphant 'progress' which could even transcend the biblical epitome of permanence: 'can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?,S9 However, Wells was right in two ways. In the first place, the perception of the early Egyptians in the late 18th and early 19th



BLACK ATHENA
centuries was as Negro - see, for instance, the famous representations of the Sphinx being measured by the French scientists of the Expedition.90 Secondly - whether or not Wells was aware ofit - Egypt, in 18I 8, was at the beginning of a 'national renaissance'.
THE NATIONAL RENAISSANCE
OF MODERN EGYPT
Here we come to a subject that appears to be a non-issue in the history of the reputation of Ancient Egypt. However, as with 'the dog that did not bark in the night' in the Sherlock Holmes story, the of the Egyptian renaissance to affect scholars' racial stereotypd of the Ancient Egyptians tells us something very significant about them. Egypt had been part of the Turkish Empire since the 16th century. However, the Turks continued to rule through the previous rulers, the Mamelukes, a corps of slaves largely from the Caucasus, who made up the most formidable section ofthe army and had controlled Egypt since the 13th century. Mameluke history is extremely bloody, and power at the top shifted frequently. By the end of the 18th century, however, commercial agricultural production, trade and manufacture had reached a level that made Egypt wealthy by world standards.91 Mameluke rule and Turkish suzerainty were then severely weakened by Napoleon's conquest in 1798, which had largely been carried out by manipulating class, religious and ethnic divisions in Egyptian society. By 1808 - after great confusion following the French withdrawal and British intervention - the British had been driven out and power had been seized by Mohamed Ali, the Albanian general of the Turkish forces. Some years later he had the Mamelukes massacred and became viceroy, virtually independent ofthe Turks. Mohamed Ali began a state-led modernization of the Egyptian economy and society that can be compared only to those of Peter the Great in Russia and the Meiji Emperor in Japan. The land of the Mamelukes and tax farmers was seized and distributed directly to peasants, who now paid a combination ofrent and tax to the state. Huge irrigation projects were set up, and the commercial cropping of cotton and sugar was established on a large scale. Furthermore, with the help
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 247
of foreign experts modern factories were built to process these crops but, as in Russia and Japan, the industrial centrepieces were the arsenals established to supply the modern army and to make it independent of foreign weapons.92 It can be claimed, with some justice, that there were harmful effects of this programme in that it made the country too dependent on cotton and built up a class ofrich commercial landowners whose influence became very detrimental to national development. In the short term, however, the programme had a startling success. By the 183os Egypt was second only to England in its modem industrial capacity.93 With these economic and political bases, Mohamed Ali began to create an Egyptian empire overseas. His modem army subdued many of the Turkish dependencies in Western Arabia, and by 1822 his generals had conquered the Sudan. He also looked towards the north, to Syria and Greece: as common subjects ofthe Ottoman Empire, many Greeks lived in the Delta and they became particularly involved in the new commercial sectors ofthe economy. After Mohamed Ali's rise to power more Greeks came both to join his new army and to take part in the
economic boom.94 With the beginning of the Greek War of Independence in 1821 the Turkish Sultan, in desperation, gave Mohamed Ali the pashaliks or provincial governorships of Crete and the Morea (the contemporary name for the Peloponnese) with a commission to exterminate the rebels. For four years the Egyptians were unable to invade because of the skilful and ferocious Greek fleet. In 1825, however, the Egyptians took advantage ofthe Greek fleet's mutiny over lack ofpay, and landed a disciplined army under Mohamed Ali's son Ibrahim. This force was able to crush the ferocious resistance of the Greek guerrillas, but only with increasingly savage repression. Ibrahim then moved north to Missolonghi, where the Greek patriots were being besieged by the
Turks. The arrival of the superior Egyptian army tipped the balance in favour ofthe Turks, and this centre ofthe Greek Revolution was taken, but only after a heroic defence which, with Byron's death there, was critical in bringing the governments of Europe round to the position of the Philhellene students and artists supporting the Greek cause. The



BLACK ATHENA
Rising now became a continental struggle between Europe on the one hand, and Asia and Africa on the other.95 To some, declining Turkey was seen as less of a threat to Greece and Europe than Egypt. As the Austrian chancellor Metternich wrote, when considering the possibility of Egypt's gaining complete independence from Turkey, 'In this way one would see the realization of what has so often been announced as the most redoubtable danger to Europe - a new African power ...,96 To counter such a possibility, the British and French governments tried to split Egypt from Turkey. They also attempted to persuade Mohamed Ali to withdraw from Morea and to force the Turkish government to grant him the pashalik ofSyria in compensation. In 1827 squadrons of the British, French and Russian navies deftroyed the Turkish and Egyptian fleets at Navarino, and Greek independence was assured. An agreement was made by which the Egyptians withdrew from the Peloponnese and released their Greek slaves. Despite this humiliation and defeat Mohamed Ali was granted Syria, and continued with his economic and military expansion.
During the 1830S the Egyptians controlled Syria and began a modernization ofthe country and an establishment ofa new power base there. At the same time, Mohamed Ali and his son Ibrahim were able to establish colonial rule over Crete. The island's population had suffered huge casualties during the savage fighting between Greeks and Turks during the Greek War of Independence: the only relative truce had been that established by Ibrahim's army when it controlled Crete for eighteen months as a stepping stone to the Peloponnese.97 After the defeat at Navarino in 1827, the Christian Cretans rose again under the protection of the European fleets. England, however, did not wish to tip the balance too far, and in 1829 Mohamed Ali was allowed to re-establish his government over the island. After three years of relative quiet Christian Cretans, dissatisfied with their subjection to Moslems while other Greeks were independent, rose in another revolt, but this was brutally suppressed. After 1834 strict colonial rule in which no favouritism was given to the Moslems was imposed, and connections with the large Greek population of Egypt were established. The economy was restored, and developed for the mutual benefit of Mohamed Ali and the Cretans. Diseases were controlled and both the
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 249
wealth and the population greatly increased in what - after decades of Turkish misrule - later seemed to have been a golden age for the island.98 In 1839 Mohamed Ali declared his independence from the Porte and invaded Turkey. Five days later the Sultan died, and soon after this the Turkish fleet mutinied and joined the Egyptians. The threat ofthe East Mediterranean under the control of non-Europeans was too terrible to contemplate, and in a show ofunity not paralleled until the Boxer Rising in China, some sixty years later, Austria, England, France, Prussia and Russia came to the aid of Turkey. Mohamed Ali was forced - under threat of blockade - to hand back North Syria and Crete and, once more, to become a vassal ofthe Turks.99 The new settlement dealt an even more severe blow to the Egyptian economy than that imposed after Navarino. During the 1830S Mohamed Ali's state-centred autarky had been weakened by European commercial penetration; after the new settlement in 1839, the Egyptian economy was forced to go back in the direction of the traditional Turkish pattern. This reversal laid it completely open to the European manufactures which weakened and often destroyed Egyptian induStry.100 Nevertheless, Mohamed Ali's descendants retained considerable wealth and power until their political and military defeat by the British. Indeed, a further and much more severe collapse of the modern economy came only after the British takeover in 1880.101 The fact that this episode ofmodern history is so little known is not at all surprising. It does not fit the paradigm ofactive European expansion into a passive outside world. The Egyptian Empire of the 19th century was like the equally obscure, short-lived success stories of the Cherokees in the Appalachians, the Maoris in New Zealand and the Chinese in California. It was an example of non-Europeans beating Europeans at their own games and therefore being coerced into giving them up.IOZ Where the racial stereotype European superiority failed, artificial intervention was necessary to preserve it. Where these events fit with our concerns is that no mention of the greatest Egyptian Empire since the time of Ramesses II appears in the contemporary writing about ancient history. It is still more remarkable that at precisely the time when Egyptians were controlling large areas of



BLACK ATHENA
Greece, the invasion of Danaos the Egyptian should have been denied, at least partly, on grounds of'national character'.103 To some extent, the failure to see any anomaly in this can be explained in terms of contemporary 'media coverage'. Although official reports noted the relative efficiency ofthe Egyptian rule, in popular reports Egyptian involvement in massacres was assimilated to the much more widespread killings by both Turks and Christian Greeks. Furthermore, the image of Blacks on the soil ofGreece was seen as particularly appalling. 104 The failure on the part of contemporary ancient historians to mention the contemporary Egyptian successes in general, and conquests in Greece in particular, cannot be entirely explained away on)he grounds that recent events are no concern of the professional hist&rian, or that there had been a complete rupture in Egyptian history with the coming ofIslam. Early- 19th-century historians were at the heart ofthe Romantic age, in which peoples were supposed to have permanent essences and characteristics. There was no hesitation at that time, for instance, in associating the pagan Goths and Vikings with Christian English and German triumphs of the 19th century. The reason for the double standard is obviously racist. It was inconvenient at the time, and even in retrospect, for historians who were convinced that Africans were racially and categorically inferior to admit that - even when led by renegade Europeans like Mohamed Ali and Ibrahim - Egyptians could form heroic conquering armies on a par with those of Napoleon, Wellington or Bliicher.
DUPUIS, JOMARD
AND CHAMPOLLION
Racism was, from the beginning, an important factor in the downplaying of the Egyptians and the dismissal of the Ancient Model, and after 1860 it became the overriding one. In the 1820S and 30S, however, the old rivalry between Egyptian religion and Christianity continued to playa significant role. I have already discussed the threat posed to Christianity by Charles Dupuis, both as a cultural adviser to revolutionary regimes and through his Origin ofAll Cults, which set out,
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
with massive corroborative detail, the claim that Christianity had arisen from the misunderstood debris of Egyptian astronomical religious
allegory. Such thinking became anathema after the French Revolution and the revival of Christianity as a necessary bastion of social order. It was not only crude reactionaries but 'critical apologists' for Christianity who were distressed by Dupuis. Coleridge declared himself to be a 'Berkeleyan' after reading him; Berkeley's defence against challenges to the historicity of the Gospels was to argue, from the position that all history is myth, that they were as reliable as any other texts. 1OS Just as Newton, Bentley and Whiston had been frightened by Toland and the Radical Enlightenment, even the enlightened in the early 19th century felt threatened by Dupuis. Ex-PresidentJohn Adams, for instance, was obsessed by him. In 1816 he wrote to his friend ThomasJefferson to say that, instead of spending money on missionaries, 'we should project a society to translate Dupuis into all languages, and offer a reward in diamonds to any man or body of men who should produce the best answer to it.,106 The diamonds should have gone to Jean
Champollion. The intensity ofthe dread ofDupuis and Egypto-Masonry with their links to the French Revolution, together with the complicated triangular relations between Christianity, Greece and Ancient Egypt, appear in the tortuous career of Champollion. The antithesis of the Oriental Renaissance, Champollion should in many ways be seen as the culmination of the Masonic Enlightenment. He seems to have discovered
his mission to decipher the hieroglyphs at very much the same point in his adolescence at which he became steeped in Masonic thought, and by the time he was twenty he had mastered Hebrew, Arabic and Coptic to prepare himself for the task. 107 A decipherment was now made possible by the availability of copies of new texts, including the newly discovered Rosetta Stone on which the same text was inscribed in Greek, Demotic and hieroglyphics. However, as Gardiner put it, Champollion was 'always inclined to hark back to his incompatible theory of the purely symbolic character of the hieroglyphics'.108 The fact that he overcame this illustrates that while his decipherment required the Masonic impulse, it could have



II:
i BLACK ATHENA
succeeded only when the Egyptian ideal was starting to crack and Romantic linguistics beginning to triumph. Only at this point could he discard the central Masonic tenet that hieroglyphs were purely symbolic and without phonetic function.
A further irony was that Champollion's first substantive discovery, in 1822, was to date to Roman times the zodiac at Dendera, which a follower of Dupuis and a leading scholar on Napoleon's Expedition, had claimed to have come from many thousands ofyears BC.109 The help that this was seen to give Christianity appears in a report made by the French ambassador to Rome on the attitude ofthe Pope, who was reported as having said that
[with this] ... important service rendered to r[.igion: 'He [Champollion] has ... humbled and confounded the pride of this philosophy which claimed to have discovered in the zodiac of Dendera a chronology earlier than that ofthe Holy Scriptures.' The Holy Father has therefore requested that M. Testa, a man most learned in the studies of Antiquity, set out in detail for him the arguments whereby M. Champollion establishes: (1) that this zodiac was constructed under Nero; and (2) that no monument exists from before 2200 BC, dating back, that is, to the time ofAbraham, so that, in accordance with our faith, there remain approximately eighteen centuries of darkness through which interpretation of the Holy Scriptures alone can guide us. 110
This help against the threat of Dupuis explains the striking change of attitude exhibited after 1822 by the Ultra nobles, as well as Louis XVIII and Charles X, towards Champollion and his elder brother, whom they had detested for their J acobinism and support for Napoleon, and the considerable patronage the younger brother received from a regime he despised. Champollion prudently restricted his historical discoveries to the post-Hyksos dynasties, then dated to 2200 BC, thus allowing biblical primacy. While this gained him support from the defenders of Christianity, his drawing attention to Egyptian triumphs from long before the earliest Greek civilization roused the hatred ofthe Hellenists. So for a time he split the alliance between Christianity and Hellenism. Champollion had many enemies in academic circles including rival
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 253
Egyptologists like Jomard, whose dating of the zodiac he had discredited, and the Romantic and conservative founder of Orientalism, Sylvestre de Sacy. The backbone of the resistance that kept him out of the Academy and the College de France, however, was made up of Hellenists likeJean Antoine Letronne and Raoul Rochette, who by this time were passionately anti-Egyptian.1ll Nevertheless, by 1829 royal patronage and the plausibility and use ofhis decipherment won enough of them over, and Champollion received long-overdue recognition. Then, in the liberal atmosphere after the July Revolution in 1830, Champollion felt free to publish his conclusion that the Egyptian calendar, and hence Egyptian civilization, went back to 3285 BC. This reunited the Christians and the Hellenists against him and after his death in 1831 Egyptology went into recession for a quarter of a century, while his Hellenist and Orientalist enemies went on to dominate the French Academic Establishment. Indeed, the ultimate irony was that his eulogy was read not by Champollion's friend and patron Dacier, the permanent Secretary ofthe Academy, but by Dacier's successor, Champollion's arch-enemy de Sacy.112
It was not until the late 1850S that translations ofEgyptian texts were considered reliable by ancient historians. This absence of any serious consideration ofEgyptology between 1831 and 1860 is ofgreat importance to the theme ofthis book, as it was precisely during this period that the Egyptian-based Ancient Model was destroyed and the Indianbased Aryan Model erected. A good example ofthis process and of the general decline in the reputation of Ancient Egypt can be seen in George Eliot's Middlemarch, which, though written in the 1860s, was a careful reconstruction of intellectual life around 1830. In the novel the old scholar Casaubon's interest in Ancient Egypt was made to typify his obscurantism. Young Ladislaw, by contrast, fresh from the centre of Romanticism, the German community in Rome, did not criticize Casaubon for his failure to take Champollion's new decipherment into account. He was scornful of his failure to read the new German scholarship and for being interested in Egypt at all. 113 The official heads of the German community in Rome during the teens and twenties were Barthold Niebuhr - the great historian of Rome and, for a time, the Prussian Minister at the Vatican - and his



254 BLACK ATHENA
secretary and successor Christian Bunsen. Both were fully in favour of the new Romanticism and passion for ethnicity. Nevertheless, together with Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, they were among the handful of German scholars who were convinced by Champollion's decipherment in the 1820S. Even they, however, had serious reservations about Egyptian culture. In 1833, as organizer of the new national museum in Berlin, Wilhelm von Humboldt insisted that while Egyptian objects were valuable to scholars - including himself - they should not be given equal status in a national museum which, for the public improvement, should be devoted ;0 Kunst
by which he meant Greek and Roman antiquities and art. 114
Christian Bunsen had studied at Gottingen, and later became the Prussian ambassador to Britain at a critical time in the 1840S. He learnt hieroglyphics and championed Egyptology in the 30S and 40S against the 'resolute mistrust and indifference ofhis countrymen', keeping the discipline alive during its doldrums, but only at the price of having Ancient Egypt turned into an alien object of study. lIS When he first contemplated working on Egyptian he wrote to Niebuhr that he had 'a kind of shrinking from it'.1l6 Describing a trip to the Villa Albani outside Rome, he recorded: 'nothing beautiful or Grecian could be looked at but everything Egyptian was sought out.'117
Bunsen's support of the German Egyptologist Reichardt Lepsius and the English Egyptologist and Assyriologist Samuel Birch have earned him a permanent place of honour in the history of Egyptology. Birch's short Dictionary ofHieroglyphics - the first of its kind in any language - was published in 1867 only as an appendix to the second edition ofthe fifth volume ofBunsen's massive Egypt's Place in Universal History. Indeed, it was for these volumes that this Egyptological aspect of Bunsen's many-sided career was chiefly known during and immediately after his lifetime.
Although he wrote the work in the 1840S, Bunsen claimed that his basic ideas on the subject had in fact been developed long before the decipherment, when he was a student at Gottingen in 1812. Thus they can be traced back to the intellectual world of Heyne, whom Bunsen met, and Blumenbach, under whom he studied. Nevertheless, there are
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 255
clearly traces of later intellectual developments in his scheme, according to which the Egyptian was an African version ofthe common root ofboth the Aramaic (Semitic) and Indo-Germanic races. Bunsen
maintained that
The civilization of the human race is principally due to two great families ofnations whose connection is a fact which is as beyond the possibility of mistake as is their early separation. What we call universal history necessarily appeared to me as the history of two races ... ofthese the Indo-Germanic seemed to me the mainstream of history; the Aramaic crossed it and formed the episodes of the
divine drama. IIS
Elsewhere he made this point in another form: 'Ifthe Hebrew Semites are the priests of humanity the Helleno-Roman Aryans are, and ever will be, its heroes.'119 This perceived inequality between the two 'master races' will be discussed further, but here it is worth emphasizing that despite Schlegel's earlier claim that the two language families were absolutely distinct, the idea ofa common origin for the Aryans and the Semites was still acceptable in the 1840S. It became less acceptable as the century wore on, but persisted until the climax of anti-Semitism in the 192 0S and 30S.120 Bunsen, maintaining that his framework fitted the new information coming from Champollion's work, saw clear links between Egyptian and Semitic, and significant ones between them and Indo
European. 121 Much ofEgypt's Place is concerned with chronology. For this Bunsen added new Egyptian and astronomical data to the Classical and biblical sources. His conclusion followed that of Champollion - that the Egyptian calendar had begun in 3285 BC. By contrast, the dates he used for universal history bore no relation to this system and would today be considered utterly fantastic. Bunsen belonged to the new generation of fervent Christians, and maintained that world history had gone through
three stages before the Flood: Sinism, 20-15,000 BC; Turanism,
d Kh . 122
15-14,000 BC; an anusm, 14-11,000 BC. The historical sequence - from China to Central Asia, to Egypt and finally to Europe - was rather different from that set out in his first draft,



BLACK ATHENA
which consisted ofthree stages: the East, then the Greeks and Romans and finally the third stage, that of the Teutonic nations. The two schemes, put together, look very like Humboldt's 'progress' from agglutinative to inflected languages or Hegel's grand sweep of the 'Phases of World History', both ofwhich were made at very much the same time. With Hegel, just as the sun moves from east to west, so the state or Universal Idea moved from the intuitive, 'theocratic despotism' of Mongolia and China, to the 'theocratic aristocracy' of India and the 'theocratic monarchy' of Persia; while Egypt was a point of transition between east and west. All these comprised the first phas70fhumanity,
which Hegel explicidy likened to childhood.123 The second phase, humanity's adolescence, was that of Greece, when there was ethical freedom for the first time. The third was that of Rome and the final climax was in the Germanic World. It is noticeable that Hegel wrote exceptionally litde about Egypt in this scheme, and his placing it above India seems to have been a shallow device to keep the overall direction of the Universal Idea from east to west. In his Leaures on the History ofPhilosophy, given between 18 I 6 and 1830, he wrote at some length on Chinese and Indian thought, but touched on Egypt only when dealing with the origins of Greek philosophy.124 Staged histories in which Oriental cultures were surpassed by European ones were thus all the rage in earlY-19th-century Germany.
To return to Bunsen. His Aryo-Semitism and his beliefin Egypt as a remote source of civilization place him firmly in the early 19th century; such ideas lost ground during his lifetime (1791-1860), and became unacceptable in academic circles after 1880. Although Bunsen and lrls contemporaries saw the Chinese and Egyptians as pioneers of civilization, Bunsen kicked them far downstairs into the antediluvian past. For him, as for nearly all mid- I 9th-century historians, true history consisted of the dialogue between Aryans and Semites. Hence Bunsen flady denied the Greek legends of Egyptian setdements in the Aegean. Like most of his contemporaries he admitted that Greek mythology contained some Semitic influences; however, following the latest German scholarship, he believed that these were indirect. According to his scheme, the Semitic Hyksos had been called Peleset or Pelasgoi when
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 257
they were expelled from Egypt in the 16th century Be. Some had setded in Crete and the South Aegean, driving out the Aryans who had lived in the islands. These Aryan islanders took the names oftheir expellers and moved to Mainland Greece, where they became the ancestors of the Ionians. It was they who, having been subjected to Semitic influence,
introduced fragments of Near Eastern culture into Greece.125 In this intricate and cumbersome way - for which there was no ancient authority - Bunsen tried to incorporate both the Greek legends about Phoenician setdement and the apparent Semitic influences in Greece, while at the same time preserving Hellenic Aryan purity. Here, however, we are going into the age ofanti-Semitism which is discussed in Chapters VIII and IX, where these differentiations between Egyptians and Phoenicians on the one hand, and Ionians and Dorians on the other, will be treated at length. At this point it is important to note that knowledge of Egyptian as a language became available for comparative purposes only many decades after scholars had given up any idea that Egyptians had colonized Greece, or that Egyptian culture had had any significant impact on the Archipelago. Hence while Renaissance and Enlightenment scholars longed to make comparative studies with Egyptian, they were unable to do so. By contrast late- 19th-century scholars, who possessed the tools, were convinced that any detailed comparison would be futile. By the 1840S Egyptian language and culture were seen as the products of a categorically inferior and more backward race, inherendy incapable of having made contributions to the great Aryan civilization and the noble languages oflndia, Greece and Rome.
EGYPTIAN MONOTHEISM OR
EGYPTIAN POLYTHEISM
It is sometimes suggested that a major reason for the fall in Egypt's reputation was disillusion with the content of Egyptian texts once they were read. This, however, does not hold for Champollion, whose enthusiasm for Egypt increased as his life went on. With the revival of the study in the late 1850s, Egyptologists were tom between their admiration for Champollion - the acknowledged founder of their



BLACK ATHENA
- and acceptance of his reverence for Egypt, and the prevadmg Romantic-Positivist ethos and contempt and condescension towards the culture. Although the congruence between the two is not exact, the key issue over which this tension was manifested was on the nature ofEgyptian religion. As the historian ofreligion Karl Beth wrote in 1916:
Monotheism or polytheism? This has been the great issue in since the discovery ofthe first Egyptian texts. The survey I have glVen here shows that both answers have their justification; it
also shows the proponents of both use these <fncepts like slogans, yet neIther concept can characterize the true individuality of Egyptian religion. 126
If, as he plausibly argued, the corpus of Egyptian texts can be read in either sense, what was - and is - the argument about? Its essence would seem to be a continuation ofthe old struggle between Egyptian religion and Christianity. If Egyptian religion were monotheist, it could be seen as the basis or origin of Christianity. In the late 19th century, however, the racial question was more salient. If Egyptian religion were monotheist, it would impinge on the Aryo-Semitic monopoly of civilization. Emmanuel de Rouge and Heinrich Brugsch, the leaders of the second wave of Egyptology in the 1860s and 70S, both followed Champollion, and the Hermetic and Platonic tradition behind him in believing. that the pure Egyptian religion was sublime and as de Rouge said: 'one idea predominates, that of a single prImeval God; everywhere and always it is One Substance, and an unapproachable God.,127
Brugsch was appointed to the chair of Egyptology at Gottingen in 1868, the first professor of the subject since the death of Champollion. He too maintained that the Egyptians had originally been monotheist as initially did Sir Peter Ie Page Renouf, the leading Egyptologist England. 128 However, by the time the second edition of his Leaures on the Origin and Growth ofReligion appeared in 188o, Renoufhad changed his mind, denying that he had stated: 'the Egyptians commenced with monotheism.'129 Internalists like the modern Egyptologist and historian
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 259
of Egyptology Erich Hornung argue that this change of opinion came from increased knowledge ofAncient Egypt.13o I find it more useful to see the denial of Egyptian monotheism as part of the process in which the racism and Romantic Hellenism that prevailed in Classics and
ancient history as a whole took over in Egyptology. The intermediate stage in this process can be seen in a passage from the work of Professor Lieblein. In a passage written in 1884, Lieblein attempted to fit the old view of monotheism into the new linguistic and historical schemes, and came up with the compromise that the Egyptians might have only had a proto-God or no God at all:
All things considered it is possible, even probable, that the idea of God has developed itself in an earlier period of languages than the Indo-European. The future will perhaps be able to supply evidence for this. The science oflanguages has been able pardy to reconstruct an Indo-European prehistoric language. It might be able also to reconstruct a prehistoric Semitic, and a prehistoric Hamitic, and of these three prehistoric languages, whose original connection it not only guesses, but even commences to prove, gradually, [sic] it will, we trust in time, be able to extract a still earlier prehistoric connection, which according to analogy might be called Noahitic. When we have come so far, we shall most likely, in this prehistoric language, also find words expressing the idea ofGod. But it is even possible that the idea of God has not come into existence in this prehistoriC language
either. l31
Thus for Lieblein the Egyptians were relegated to the distant and primitive past. The last traces of the Platonic, Hermetic and Masonic respect for Egypt were being expelled from academia, and a full-scale attack on the older Egyptology was launched a few years later by the French Egyptologist Maspero. As he described the situation in 1893:
I believed at the beginning of my career, which will soon be twenty-five years ago, and I maintained for a long time like M. Brugsch that the Egyptians arrived during their earliest period at the notion of divine unity and they took from this an entire religious system and symbolic mythology ... this was the period when I had



BLACK ATHENA
not myselftried to decipher religious texts and when I limited myself to reproducing the texts of our great masters. When I was forced to tackle them ... I had to admit that they did not show any of the profound wisdom that others had seen in them. I cannot be accused ofwanting to depreciate the Egyptians and I am convinced that they were one of the great people of humanity, one of the most original and the most creative, but they always remained semi-barbarians ... They invented, produced and above all, promised much in art, in science, and in industry, but their religion presents the same mixture of coarseness and refinement that one finds in the zest. 132
What is significant about this statement by a liberal Frenchman and heir to the Enlightenment is not the description of the Egyptians, most ofwhich would seem eminendy fair. It is the implication that there were other, presumably Indo-European and Christian civilizations that were entirely refined and lacking in barbarism.133 Elsewhere in the same passage, however, Maspero showed his racist colours quite clearly:
Time, which has done so much harm to other nations, has shown itself most favourable to the Egyptians. It has spared their tombs, their temples, their statues, and the thousand small objects which were the pride of their domestic life, and it has led us in such a way that we judge them by the most beautiful and the prettiest of the things which they made, and has at length caused us to place their civilization on the same footing as that ofthe Romans or the Greeks. But ifit be looked at more nearly, the point ofview changes; to speak quite shortly, Thothmes III and Rameses II resemble Mtesa of Central Africa more than they do Alexander or Caesar ...134
The argument that one should not be deceived by mere appearances into breaking the 'scientific' laws of racism is also interesting as an indication of the complete rupture between the scientific and prescientific period seen by late-19th-century scholars. For Maspero and his contemporaries, Ancient Egypt was a modern discovery. Anything written about it before Napoleon's Expedition and Champollion's decipherment had no relevance whatsoever. Moreover, Maspero continued:
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
Most of its myths it holds in common with the most savage tribes of the Old and the New Worlds. The Egyptian possessed the spirit ofa subde metaphysician, a fact which he proved when Christianity furnished him with a subject worthy of his subde powers.135
One might think that having been stripped of civilization, religion and philosophy, the Egyptians might be allowed the shred of metaphysics. However, the tidal wave of racism could not even tolerate this. Ten years later, in 1904, the English Egyptologist Wallis Budge added:
The Egyptians, being fundamentally an African people, possessed all the virtues and vices which characterized the North African races generally, and it is not to be held for a moment that any African people could become metaphysicians in the modern sense of the word. In the first place, no African language is suitable for giving expression to theological and philosophical speculations, and even an Egyptian priest ofthe highest intellectual attainments would have been unable to render a treatise ofAristode into language which his brother priests, without teaching, could understand. The mere construction of the language would make such a thing an impossibility, to say nothing of the ideas of the great Greek philosopher, which belong to a domain of thought and culture wholly foreign to
the Egyptian.136
Here, as well as using the common 19th-century strategem of justifying his racism on linguistic grounds, Budge was being subde! It is true that nothing like Aristode is attested in Egyptian thought, but Budge used this absence to imply that there was a categorical distinction between Greek and Egyptian thought as wholes. He could not, for instance, have
used Plato as an example. Elsewhere Budge attacked Brugsch's argument that the commonest Egyptian word for 'divine', nJr, was identical with the Greek and
the Latin natura:
It is difficult to see how the eminent Egyptologist could attempt to compare the conception of God formed by a half-civilized African people with those of such cultivated nations as the Greeks and Romans. 137

BLACK ATHENA
There is no doubt that this contempt is at some level related to the British occupation of Egypt and dislike of the inhabitants of that country. Indeed, after 1880 Egypt became - with the exceptions of Ireland and Somaliland - the most troublesome British possession. Budge's own identification with imperialism is typified by the dedication of his great work The Gods ofthe Egyptians to Lord Cromer, who presided over the destruction ofthe Egyptian manufacturing economy, as 'The Regenerator of Egypt'.
Gennan scholars were not behind the British and French in their scepticism about the Egyptians. Lieblein's of their monotheism was followed by forthright criticism and for any idea of their having had an ancient wisdom.138 Moreover, by the 1880s some Egyptologists shared the Indo-Europeanists' concepts of Aryan linguistic purity. As Professor A. Bezzenberger, editor of the leading journal in Indo-European studies, Beitriige zur Kunde tier indogermanischen Sprachen, described the situation in 1883:
It is maintained by many that Egypt had a very significant influence on Ancient Greece. However, this assumption has up to now never had the least proof from the point of view of language. Given the seriousness of the question, such a proof is definitely called for. I therefore directed myselfto Herr Dr Adolph Ennan [later to become the doyen of Gennan Egyptology] and asked him to collect and treat the true and supposed Egyptian loan words in Greek.
Ennan, who had a good - though heavy - sense ofhumour, replied: 'In theory I should be delighted to go along with your proposal- but it appears to me that the most important requisite is lacking: the loan words themselves. One can find enough "supposed" ones in Egyptological works. But as far as my understanding reaches I cannot see a single one that is sure.,139
Ennan admitted that some Egyptian words for Egyptian objects had been used in Greek, but these- were not true loans. In the next issue of the journal Ennan was challenged on this. His response to the challenge was to make two concessions:
leH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
I never claimed that there were no Egyptian loan words in Greek. I merely stated that I did not know ofany secure cases. I do not believe that the names of Egyptian objects that appear here and there in the Greek authors should be seen as accepted Greek loan words.140
His second concession was to admit that the word (small boat), which clearly came from the late Egyptian and Demotic br (small boat), had been assimilated into Greek. He ended defiandy, however:
After this all that remains is essentially negative; there are a few 'culture words' and probably one true loan word, and that is all; the conventional view of a deep Egyptian influence on Greece does not reach the same results. I do not doubt that broad-minded colleagues could find substantially more, as I could have. I must in this case remind them that in a script in which the vowels are unmarked, and with a vocabulary in which the meanings are very precarious, with some good will, one can find an Egyptian origin for every Greek word ... This is a sport that I happily leave to others.141
Although this attitude was typical among Egyptologists of the time and later, it must be admitted that Ennan's attitude of condescension towards the Ancient Egyptians was notorious among Egyptologists. Alan Gardiner reported the following story about him:
Once Ennan asked Maspero to get collated for him a passage in the Pyramid Texts, of which a set of squeezes existed in Paris. On reception ofthe collation Ennan wrote to Maspero: 'What a pity it is that even at this early period the Egyptians could not write correcdy!' On which Maspero's caustic comment - not communicated to Ennan, needless to say - was: 'What a pity that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom had not read M. Ennan's grammar!,142
Nevertheless, despite Ennan's extremism on this, I think it is fair to say that this essentially racist attitude ofscepticism about, and scorn for, Egyptian achievements was predominant in Egyptology throughout the high tide ofimperialism between 1880 and 1950. It would, however, be oversimplifying to say it was the only one. Resistance to this view on or beyond the fringes ofacademia will be touched on later in this chapter,



BLACK ATHENA
but there were exceptions to it even in the heart ofthe discipline. It was precisely at the peak ofracism in the first decade ofthe 20th century, for instance, that ProfessorJames Henry Breasted published the Memphite Theology, which I discussed in Chapter II. Its conception of the world, he concluded,
forms quite a sufficient basis for suggesting that the later notions of nous and logos, hitherto supposed to have been introduced into Egypt from abroad at a much later date, was present at this early period. Thus the Greek tradition of the origin of their philosophy in Egypt undoubtedly contains more ofthe truth than hasm-recent years been conceded.
He continued:
The habit, later so prevalent among the Greeks, of interpreting philosophically the functions and relations of the Egyptian gods ... had already begun in Egypt before the earliest Greek philosophers were born; and it is not impossible that the Greek practice of the
interpretations of their own gods received its first impulse from Egypt. 143
This conclusion would seem to have been forced on him by the text itself, however, and seems to have been anomalous even in Breasted's own thinking. Later on, in his The Development ojReligion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, he wrote in the standard linguistic racist terms:
The Egyptian did not possess the terminology for the expression ofa system of abstract thought, neither did he develop the capacity to create the necessary terminology, as did the Greek. He thought in concrete pictures.144
A still more striking exception to the prevailing fashions in academia at the tum of the 19th century was the work of the French Classicist Paul Foucart, who knew a considerable amount about Egypt and whose son Georges was an Egyptologist. Foucart's detailed work on the mystery cult at Eleusis led him not only to the conclude that the cult had been introduced from Egypt but also to make an articulate defence of the Ancient Model which will be discussed in the next chapter.
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
From the point ofview of the 20th-century orthodoxy, however, the difficultywith Foucart has been that his work on Eleusinian inscriptions was so superb that later scholars working in the field have found it indispensable. Hence, subsequent workers have tended to distinguish the brilliant epigrapher from the cranky theorist. As one put it: 'One can only be sincerely sorry that such a significant scholar should hold this error. ,145
Despite these aberrations or heresies, there is no doubt that during the first two-thirds of the 20th century most 'sound' scholars did not take the Egyptians too seriously. Interestingly, however, there was a significant change in their pejorative image. Most 19th-century scholars accepted the view, propounded by Winckelmann and others, that the Egyptians were an old and strangely dead people. With the firm establishment of the paradigm of 'progress', and with the analogy between history and biography, the Egyptians were pushed into precisely the opposite position. They now began to be thought of as children, and came to occupy a rather similar niche to that of Winckelmann's carefree Greeks. In his Egyptian Grammar, published in 1927 and generally accepted as the 'bible' of modem Egyptology, Alan Gardiner wrote:
Despite the reputation for philosophic wisdom attributed to the Egyptians by the Greeks, no people has ever shown itselfmore averse from speculations or more wholeheartedly devoted to material interests; and if they paid an exaggerated attention to funerary observances, it was because the continuance of earthly pursuits and pleasures was felt to be at stake, assuredly not out of any curiosity as to the why and whither of human life.
He later described the Egyptians as 'a pleasure-loving people, gay, artistic and sharp-witted, but lacking in depth of feeling and idealism' .146 Thus both the ancient reputation of profound wisdom and the old one ofpassivity and gloom were stood on their heads. Nevertheless, the Egyptians remained categorically inferior to Europeans. Elsewhere, however, Gardiner admitted that Egyptologists were under some constraints: 'Classical scholars have not in the past taken very kindly to the idea of Hellenic dependence on Egyptian civilization.'147



II
I 266 BLACK ATHENA
Given the centrality and strength of Classics within the universities, there was nothing the Egyptologists in a small peripheral discipline could do about the denigration ofEgypt, even ifthey wanted to. Few, if any, did. Nearly all of them had had a thorough Classical education before beginning their own subject. Thus Gardiner was clearly reflecting the views of most of his colleagues when he wrote: 'The supposed Greek dependence on Egyptian philosophy proves on examination tobe the merest moonshine.'148
The denial ofEgyptian philosophy and suspiciop ofEgyptian religion dominated Egyptology until the I 960s. Hornung(for instance, refers to 'half a century of abstinence' from considering the problem of the fundamental nature of Egyptian religion. 149 There were, in fact, one or
two other scholars like Margaret Murray who continued to take Egyptian religion seriously, but they were considered by 'sound' scholars to be on the fringes ofEgyptology. 150
However, cracks in the orthodoxy began to appear after the Second World War. In 1948 Abbe Etienne Drioton, Director General of the Egyptian Antiquities Service, began to see genuine religion in the Egyptian Wisdom Literature and to consider the possibility ofan earlier monotheism. 151
Since the 1960s this more open attitude has begun to establish itself, especially in France and Germany. In these countries the possibility of real Egyptian spirituality and originality began to be considered once more. Some Egyptologists, like the German Hellmut Brunner, are even calling for a 'new picture of Egypt', and Brunner maintains that there was a qualitative intellectual and spiritual leap in Egypt around the tum of the 3rd millennium. IS2 Despite this new flexibility, however, there is still a considerable gap between the discipline of Egyptology. and what one could call its 'counter-cultures'.
POPULAR PERCEPTIONS OF
ANCIENT EGYPT IN THE 19TH
AND 20TH CENTURIES
Before going on to examine the counter-currents on the periphery of academia to this prevailing view of Egyptian intellectual and spiritual
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
life, I want to consider attitudes towards Ancient Egypt in society at large. It is commonly believed that as a result of the Napoleonic Expedition there was a period ofEgyptomania in the early 19th century. Indeed, this picture fits the general pattern best articulated by Raymond Schwab, according to which the Romantic-Positivists were the first Europeans to be truly aware of the outside world. This view in tum derives from and reinforces the notion that the only proper relationship between Europe and other continents is one of clear-cut superiority, which did not exist until the 19th century. Nevertheless, the conventional view ofa period ofEgyptomania does contain an element oftruth and there was, in fact, great curiosity about Egypt in the early 19th
century. However, as we have seen, there was considerable interest in, and knowledge about, Egypt long before that period.153 Furthermore, Egypt
exerted much more influence on Europe from the 15th to the 18th century than it did in the 19th. There is also no doubt that 19th-century 'Egyptomania' was weaker than 'Indomania', and trivial in comparison to the 'Hellenomania' or passion for Greece that swept Northern Europe and America in the same period. What is more, Greece was seen, in the eyes of most people, as a revered and beloved ancestor, while Egypt was now perceived as essentially alien or exotic. It remains true, however, that there was intense interest throughout Europe in the publications of the French Expedition and the results of further explorations and discoveries. 154 Not surprisingly these focused on pyramids and tombs, and in the second halfofthe century there were translations of the Egyptian guide book for the soul, The Book of the Going Forth by Day, generally known as The Book ofthe Dead. All this increased the by now well-established impression of Egypt as a gloomy and dead kingdom, and as such it was given one domain that was very important in the middle and late 19th century - that of death. Egyptian styles appeared in all the cemeteries of Europe and North America. 155
What is more, mummification became widespread in the United States during the I860s and 70S. Although this development is often attributed to the higher requirements of hygiene in urban societies, it is still interesting to contrast the American (Egyptian) way of death with the spread ofcremation - the Greek form ofdisposal- adopted in much

of Northern Europe at the same time. 15b Was this because ofthe much greater influence of Freemasonry in the USA?
Masonry remained the great repository ofrespect for Egypt. Indeed, Masonic architecture, symbols and rituals continued - and continue _ to follow their Egyptian traditions rather than the dictates of academic fashion. 157 In the USA Masonry, Egypt and hieroglyphics were central to the foundation of Mormonism in the I820S, and had a major influence on mid- and late-19th-century American writers. Melville's novels - especially Moby Dick - are fuij of Egyptian symbols and
hieroglyphs, while Hawthorne's The s/arlet Letter bears the same stamp.15S
Although Masons were very influential in Europe as well, there the craft's concern with Egypt was almost completely confined to its inner or spiritual life. Like the rest ofthe European upper and middle classes, Masons were much more taken up with the prevailing Hellenomania. Other, much smaller groups also retained a central position for Egypt in their beliefs: the Rosicrucians, both as an inner ring of the Masons and as a separate spiritual organization, kept and keep Egypt as the centre and origin of their beliefs. The mystical Swedenborgians of the 18th and 19th centuries and the later Theosophists and Anthroposophists also placed Egypt in a central position. 159
In the first halfofthe 19th century, however, the St Simonians were a much more influential group. These disciples ofthe pioneer 'socialist' and proto-Positivist Claude Henri Comte de St Simon followed a typical tripartite view of world history, in which the third and final 'epoch of the positive system' involved the unification of the world. Such a unification required opening up communications throughout the world and for St Simon, as for Napoleon and most thinkers of the time, Egypt was the bridge between east and west. 160 Thus he and his successor Prosper Enfantin were particularly concerned with the country, not just from the spiritual and but also from the practical point o f view.
Enfantin arrived in Egypt in 1833 with a number of disciples including engineers, doctors, businessmen and writers. He had official approval from the new French regime ofLouis Philippe for what he saw as the second French intellectual and scientific expedition; however, he
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS
also had a mystic mission as 'the father', to marry the mysterious 'mother' in the Orient. The mission, in turn, was linked to the practical project ofbuilding the Suez Canal. Articulating the imagery ofpiercing a canal, and in a travesty ofthe general beliefthat European domination of non-Europeans was somehow a heterosexual sexual act, Enfantin wrote: 'Suez is the Centre ofour life work. We shall carry out the act for which the world is waiting to proclaim that we are male!,161 The canal
was built by a member of this group, Ferdinand de Lesseps, but not until the I 860s. In the meantime St Simonians played key roles as engineers, doctors, teachers and so on in Mohamed Ali's state-led modernization of Egypt, and the image of their project was very much like that ofNapoleon's Expedition - that of France reawakening Egypt, the ancient source of civilization.162 It was in this St Simonian atmosphere that Mohamed Ali's grandson Ismail commissioned Verdi, the composer ofthe Italian Risorgimento, to create an Egyptian national opera, Aida. The opera's plot - devised by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who was employed by the Egyptian government - glorified Ancient Egypt in a Western manner. However, the difference from the 18th century is clear: where Mozart glorified the priests who possessed Egyptian wisdom and morality, Verdi placed his priests in opposition to Aida and her lover Radames. 163 Aida became a great success all over Europe. This continued acceptance ofa favourable view ofEgypt - as essentially white and as a fount of civilization - was especially widespread in France and Italy, but it can also be seen in the art of England and the United States. 1M Together with the Egyptophilia of the second generation of Egyptologists of the 1860s and 70S, it explains the defensiveness or defiance noted above in the statements of the scholars of the I880s, like Maspero and Erman. They, like the Classicists but unlike the general public, had an overall and systematic view and could see the threat that too favourable a picture of Egypt could pose to the uniqueness of Greek civilization and that of Europe as a whole.



270 BLACK ATHENA
ELLIOT SMITH AND
'DIFFUSIONISM'
There were, however, two other threats to the new conventional wisdom from within academia itself. We will first consider the one that arose later because so far, at least, it has had a less serious impact on Egyptology; it came from the 'diffusionist' ideas ofElliot Smith. Born in Australia in 1871, Smith qualified as a doctor and went to England, where he became a distinguished anatomist. In 1901 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy at Cairo, he set up a medical school. During his next eight years there he became fascinated by early Egyptnot only its physical anthropology, but its culture. 165 It was in this period
that he became convinced that Egypt had been the source of Near Eastern and European culture.
Elliot Smith was a man of his racist times. Thus, while he could not avoid the fact that the bulk of the Egyptian population had always been very much like that of the rest of East Africa, he was convinced that in the 'Pyramid Times' - the Old Kingdom - there had been a critical ?fbroad-skulled - non-Semitic - Asiatics. 166 According to him, this nuxed race had migrated around the Mediterranean and on into Northern Europe, bringing the megalithic culture whose impressive monuments he saw as reflections of the Pyramids. This part of Elliot Smith's theories is now completely untenable, as carbon dating has
shown that the European megalithic culture began over 1,000 years before the Pyramid Age. 167
Elliot Smith's views were received with interest by the British public because 'diffusionism' fitted so well with contemporary Imperialism. because his Egyptians were not African; and because he was anatomist. Anatomy was considered to be a 'hard' science whereas the disciplines of history and archaeology did not have tha; status. Professional ancient historians and Egyptologists were naturally much
more.war:. As as I am aware, there was no attempt to incorporate his mto theIr academic disciplines. Nevertheless, he did not get mto senous trouble until he expanded his scope to claim that Egypt had been the source not only ofEuropean culture, but that ofthe rest of the world. He found Egyptian origins for the Pyramids ofMexico, and
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 27 1
for the mummification techniques ofPeru and the Torres Strait Islands
near New Guinea. Paradoxically, this part of his theories stands up today rather better than does that about the megalithic cultures of Europe. On the one hand, increased archaeology and carbon dating have shown that the metal-using cultures ofSouth-West Asia and the Neolithic cultures of Europe were considerably older than those of Egypt, thus invalidating his theories in these areas. On the other, the increased evidence of African influence on Pre-Columbian America after about 1000 BC, and discoveries such as the fact that the Meso-American Pyramids were not merely bases for temples but could contain burials, strengthen the possibility of indirect Egyptian influence on these much later civilizations.168
At the time, however, Elliot Smith's second great book in this field, The Ancient Egyptians and the Origin ofCivilization, published in 1923, led to attacks from conservatives who retained the Romantic views of local peculiarity, and hardline racists who sawall civilization as stemming from the pure Aryans. There were even more violent struggles with the liberals, who were beginning to turn anthropology from a racist stronghold - whose practitioners were used to maintain empires cheaply - into one that could bring cultural relativism home to Europe. Nevertheless, during the 1920S the battle was not uneven. Elliot Smith had the backing of most in his own discipline, and his students gained important positions in physical anthropology. He even converted W. H. R. Rivers, one of the founders of social anthropology, to his beliefs. Furthermore, there were at that time no senior social anthropologists who had been trained in the discipline who could outrank Smith.169 Even more important, he had good connections
with the Rockefellers, whose foundations provided massive funding for both Egyptology and anthropology in the 1920S and 30S. With all these resources Elliot Smith had considerable clout inside academia. 170
Even so, the combination of forces arrayed against him proved too strong. Rivers died prematurely in 1922, and Elliot Smith himself in 1937 at only sixty-six. Even if they had lived longer, the connection between his ideas and racism could never have survived the revulsion



27 2 BLACK ATHENA
against the latter during and after the Second World War. Nevertheless, the threat to anthropology that Elliot Smith represented at a vulnerable stage in the discipline's development can still be seen: it is in the shudder or grimace at the mention of his name or the word 'diffusionism' that is still a necessary sign oforthodoxy or 'competence' in the field.
JOMARD AND THE
MYSTERY OF THE PYRAMIDS
Although they generally disliked an interloper trampling over their territory, Egyptologists and ancient historians were much less involved in this struggle than anthropologists. This was possibly because Elliot Smith never even approached language, the sanctum sanctorum of Romantic-Positivism. They were, however, much more concerned with the second threat to Egyptology, which was far longer-lasting than 'diffusionism'. This academic heresy had its ultimate origin in the ancient view that the Egyptians had been the possessors of an superior wisdom, which the Greeks had been unable to learn and preserve in its entirety.
This was revived in the early 19th century by the work of Champollion's bitter and lifelong rival Jomard, the mathematician and surveyer attached to Napoleon's Expedition whom we have already encountered. J omard put together the results of his own surveys of the Great Pyramid at Giza and its precise geographical position, with ancient descriptions of the mathematical significance of its measurements. He became convinced that the Ancient Egyptians must have had an accurate knowledge ofthe earth's circumference and based their units of linear measurement upon it, which, of course, put him firmly in the camp ofDupuis. There were criticisms ofdetails in his work, but in the Masonic atmosphere of the Napoleonic Empire his views were treated very seriously; having become a member of the
French academic Establishment before the Restoration, he was able to survive it. 171
Despite the blow toJomard's reputation overflte dating ofthe zodiac at Dendera, his ideas survived or were frequently rediscovered and
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 273
developed throughout the 19th century. In Differences between this heterodox school and academic Egyptology became sharp after the discipline's establishment in the 1860s, and acute in the 1880s after it accepted the dominance of Classics. At no stage, however, were there formal debates between the two. This was firstly because ofthe general principle that no group holding academic power will willingly 'dignify' outsiders in this way; and secondly because the two groups were speaking different scholarly languages. In fact, they reflected the differences between Champollion andJ omard. The Egyptologists were primarily philologists applying the new techniques of linguistics to the Egyptian written material. The heretics, however, were mathematicians, surveyors and astronomers, few of whom gained any fluency in Egyptian. On the other hand, 19th-century Egyptologists were unable to follow, let alone refute, the heretics' technical arguments. The struggle was unequal from the start, for the heretics were fighting against the two principal paradigms of the 19th century 'progress' and racism. If they were right, an ancient African or semiAfrican people had had better mathematics than any European until the 19th century itself. At a more mundane level the heretics, lacking the discipline and sanctions of formally organized academic knowledge, sometimes slipped into religious fantasy. The tendency to do this was increased by the genuine difficulty the heretics had in accounting for the astounding achievements they found in the ancient mathematics and astronomy, which led them to explanations in terms of divine revelation. This in tum sometimes encouraged beliefs that the Pyramids contained divine prophecies.173 All this served to discredit such 'Pyramidiocy', as it came to be called. Another grave disadvantage for the heretics was the fact that Classics and linguistics had a higher status in 19th-century Germany and England than mathematics. In France, with its Polytechniques, the situation was more finely balanced, and here Egyptologists seem to have been under some pressure to consider arguments in the tradition of Jomard. In the 19th century, for instance, Maspero was forced to concede that he had been convinced by the astronomer Sir Norman Lockyer's detailed arguments for the case that the Egyptian temples had been very carefully built for astronomical purposes.174 What is



274 BLACK ATHENA
striking, however, is that so many men - including such distinguished and well-established astronomers as Professor Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, and Sir Norman Lockyer - should have risked or given up their careers to pursue these ideas. In the case of Piazzi Smyth it can partly be explained in terms ofreligious enthusiasm, but here, as with Lockyer, sheer excitement over the mathematical elegance of the correspondences seems to have been the major motivation. 175
The 'pyramidologists' regiived their biggest setback with the defection of Flinders Petrie, mentioned on p. 138 for his early dating of the Hermetic Texts. Petrie had an engineering and surveying background, as well as an enthusiasm for the ideas of Smyth and other successors of J omard, and in 1880 he was able to go to Egypt with the latest surveying equipment to check for himself the accuracy of previous
measurements. His conclusions were inconclusive. On the one hand, he agreed that the Great Pyramid had been aligned to the cardinal points of the compass with more accuracy than any later building, and that the measurements ofthe inner chamber demonstrated a knowledge ofJt as 22/7 and ofPythagorean triangles. In general, too, he was astounded by the technical and mathematical skills that had gone into the Pyramids' construction. On the other hand, he disagreed with Piazzi Smyth on the length of the cubit used in the construction, and he did not accept Smyth's claim that the building incorporated the precise length of the year. 176 Moreover, given the changes taking place within Egyptology in the 1880s and the general professionalization in academia and elsewhere between 1880 and 1960, 'pyramidologist' theories were pushed into the new category ofcrankiness or pseudo-science. With his superb surveying and his development of typologies for the ordering of different styles of pottery, Petrie became the founder not only ofEgyptian but ofall modem archaeology. Later knighted, he was incorporated into academic Egyptology and provided it with essential support. Nevertheless, the relationship was never easy. 177 He had to be given a chair by an outside donor, and remained a maverick until the end ofhis long life in 1942. Petrie's defection did not stop the investigation of the Pyramids and
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 275
other Egyptian constructions in the beliefthat they could reveal a higher ancient wisdom. Lockyer continued to develop his ideas on the sophisticated astronomical knowledge demonstrated in Egyptian buildings, and these were taken up in the 20th century by a number of scholars, most notably by the brilliant amateur Schwaller de Lubicz. De Lubicz's books, published in the 1950S and 60S, have had a wide success particularly in mystic circles, but also among the public at large. 178 Meanwhile, a new and still more accurate survey ofthe Pyramids had been made by the engineerJ. H. Cole in 1925. This survey confirmed many of the claims made by earlier 'pyramidologists' - even those of
Jomard, who appears to have arrived at relatively accurate estimates for lengths for the Egyptian units of measurement as the result of two countervailing errors. The imprecision ofhis measurement was counterbalanced by his failure to realize that the Great Pyramid must have had a peak or pyramidion on its top. Moreover, since the 1920S there have even been two significant defections to the 'pyramidological' position from 'straight' academia. The first of these was Livio Catullo Stecchini, an Italian who studied in Germany and gained a doctorate in ancient mensuration at Harvard. In a number of studies published in the 1950S and 60S Stecchini demonstrated, with some plausibility, that the Egyptians had had a very precise knowledge ofglobal measurement and that this knowledge had been applied in Egypt and elsewhere with extraordinary exactitude. 179
The second conversion to the belief in a higher ancient wisdom was much more spectacular: it was that of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, historians of Renaissance science, Giorgio de Santillana. Having written a major book on Galileo, de Santillana became interested in the Hermetic Egyptian tradition; then, late in life, he read Dupuis's Origine de tous les roltes, and was convinced by its argument that much of ancient mythology was indeed allegory for scientific astronomy. However, de Santillana went beyond Dupuis and Egypt to claim an even earlier knowledge, traces of which could be found in myths from all over the world and which, by using the precession ofthe equinoxes, he dated to before 6000 Be. Despite de Santillana's enormous reputation, Hamlet's Mill - the book in which he and a younger German colleague set out this scheme



BLACK ATHENA
was not accepted by any university press and was published commercially. This means that respectable scholars are not obliged to take such work into account. ISO In addition, de Santillana's having stuck his neck out so far lessened his effectiveness as a proponent of the school of Dupuis and Jomard. Furthermore, his work - like that of Stecchini and Tompkins - could be lumped together with a more or less 'lunatic fringe'; this allowed or even compelled orthodox scholars to
ignore it. Through the influe,e of archaeology, Egyptologists and ancient historians tend to be more numerate now than they were fifty or a hundred years ago. Nevertheless, few ofthem have the combination of time, effort and skill necessary to take on the very technical arguments of Schwaller de Lubicz, Stecchini or de Santillana. Rather, over the last thirty years the tendency within these disciplines has been to rely on the refutations by another grand old man of the history of science, Professor Otto Neugebauer, whose name has almost tantric power among defenders ofthe status quo. Neugebauer's range is astounding. He has already been mentioned in connection with Copernicus, but his best-known work has been on science in Antiquity. Here he has been more broad-minded than most and, just as he has been prepared to concede the Islamic science behind Copernicus, he has demonstrated some significant Mesopotamian influences on Greek mathematics and astronomy.181 He has also published several works on Egyptian astronomy in collaboration with orthodox Egyptologists, but in these, in sharp contrast to his treatment of Mesopotamia, he shares his collaborators' condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Egypt and Hermeticism.182 Indeed, in all his works Neugebauer has insisted that the Egyptians had no original or abstract ideas. The accurate alignments of the Pyramids and temples, and the use of Jt, are all explained as the results of practical knacks rather than ofprofound thought; an example ofthis being the following: 'It has even been claimed that the area of a hemisphere was correcdy found in an example ofthe Moscow papyrus, but the text admits also of a much more primitive interpretation, which is preferable' (my italics).183 Interestingly, however, Neugebauer does not take on the Pyramid school. He simply denounces them:
[CH. V] ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 277
Important mathematical constants, e.g. an accurate value of Jt and deep astronomical knowledge, are supposed to be built into the dimensions and structure ofthis building. These theories contradict flady all sound knowledge obtained by archaeology and by Egyptological research about the history and purposes of the Pyramids. 184
He then recommends that those interested in what he admits to be 'the very complex historical and archaeological problems connected with the Pyramids' read the books by Edwards and Lauer on the subject. ISS
The Egyptian archaeologist Edwards does not involve himself with the 'pyramidologists' and their calculations. The surveyor and archaeologist Lauer did, in the face of opposition from Egyptologists, who were 'astonished that we should give so much importance to the discussion of theories which have never had any credit in the Egyptological world'.186
All told, Lauer's work had a certain contradictory quality. On the one hand, he admitted that the measurements do have some remarkable properties; that one can find such relations as Jt, <p, the 'golden number' and Pythagoras' triangle from them; and that these generally correspond to what Herodotos and other ancient writers claimed for them. 187
On the other, he denounced the 'fantasies' of Jomard and Piazzi Smyth; he attacked, rather implausibly, Jomard's reconstructed cubit; and claimed that the formulae and the extraordinary degree of sidereal accuracy with which the Pyramids were aligned were purely the result of 'intuitive and utilitarian empiricism'.188 The contradiction between an acceptance of the extraordinary mathematical precision of the Great Pyramid and a 'certainty' that the Greeks were the first 'true' mathematicians runs throughout Lauer's many writings on the subject. The tension is made still more unbearable by the facts that the Greeks had been told about many ofthe Pyramid's extraordinary features and that they believed the Egyptians to have been the first mathematicians and astronomers. Finally, there is the problem that so many ofthe Greek mathematicians and astronomers had studied in Egypt. Lauer's honest attempt to deal with these difficulties was the following:



BLACK ATHENA
Even though up to now no esoteric Egyptian mathematical document has been discovered, we know, ifwe can believe the Greeks, that the Egyptian priests were very jealous of the secrets oftheir science and that they occupied themselves, Aristotle tells us, in mathematics. It seems, then, reasonably probable that they had been in possession of an esoteric science erected, little by little, in the secrecy of the temples during the long centuries that separate the construction of the pyramids, towards the year 2800, to the eve of Greek mathematical thought in the §ill century BC. As far as geometry is concerned, the analysis ofbuildings as famous as the Great Pyramid would take a notable place in the researches of these priests; and it is perfectly conceivable that they could have succeeded in discovering in it, perhaps long after their erection, chance qualities that had remained totally unsuspected to the constructors.189
Lauer was a discoverer of the actual existence of the 3rd-dynasty architect Imhotep, previously dismissed as a late Egyptian legend, and he excavated some of the latter's superb buildings at Saqqara. He also spent a lifetime admiring the extraordinary achievements of the Pyramids. It is difficult to see why he should then baulk at the simplest solution, believe the Greeks and accept, with the German Egyptologist Professor Brunner, that there was an Achsenzeit or 'axial age' around 3000 Be. Thus one or two centuries later, in the 3rd and 4th Dynasties, there was a sophisticated knowledge of mathematics, some features ofwhich were built into the Great Pyramid. Traditions of this were retained by later Egyptians and hence told to visiting Greeks. 190
Why - if one discards racist and crudely 'progressive' arguments should this be any more improbable than the Greeks having achieved a qualitative intellectual breakthrough in the 4th century BC? Indeed, there is nothing to back the second hypothesis, approximating to the actual achievements of the Pyramids and the consistent ancient tradition of a superior Egyptian mathematics. However, such a perspective was not available to conventional scholars at the height of imperialism. It is nevertheless clear that Lauer was anguished on the issue and ultimately seems to have been constrained by social forces. To accept the. simplest answer would have
[CH. VI ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS 279
made him a crank, likeJomard and Piazzi Smyth. Thus he preferred to atttibute the exquisite mathematical relationships in the Great Pyramid and their place in ancient tradition to mere chance which Egyptian
priests had later discovered and exploited. However, even Lauer's solution still allowed some later Egyptians to have been capable of some relatively advanced thought. He continued:
For the whole length of the 3,000 years of her history, Egypt thus, little by little, prepared the way for the Greek scholars who - like Thales, Pythagoras and Plato - came to study then even to teach, like Euclid, at the school in Alexandria. But it was in their philosophic spirit, which knew how to draw from the treasure amassed by the technical Positivism of the Egyptians, that geometry came to the stage of a genuine science. 191
How could Lauer be sure, against the ancient writers who insisted on the spirituality and unworldliness of the Egyptian priests, that the Egyptian secret wisdom - about which he had no evidence - was merely 'technical Positivism'? It is hard not to see this simply as an article of faith for all who work in the Aryan Model. The nameless Egyptologists who disapproved of Lauer's discussion of the 'pyramidologists" theories were quite right to do so. By fighting the 'pyramidologists' he came to resemble them - or at least to accept so many of their arguments as to make his own defence of the orthodoxy
seem hopelessly cumbersome. Lauer was not alone in his difficulty. The Abbe Drioton, who has been mentioned above for his acceptance of Egyptian spirituality, wrote: 'one should pay no attention to the ... renewed delusions of Charles Piazzi Smyth that the measurements of the Great Pyramid reveal a mysterious science of the Ancient Egyptians.,192 Elsewhere, however, he wrote that because they fail to pay attention to the 'pyramidologists', Egyptologists are being treated like 'naif, blind, refractory dabblers in a science whose quiet routines have been disturbed,.193 There have been other hints that a number of'respectable' Egyptologists feel pressure from the outside - or the material they handle? - and have toyed for more or less long periods of time with the heresies.194 In this important skirmish between an Ancient and an



280 BLACK ATHENA
Aryan Model, I believe that the Ancient will- with some modifications - prevail. In the meantime, however, there is no doubt that the field as a whole still basically follows the linguistic tradition of Champollion as transformed by Maspero, Erman and the other scholars ofthe late 19th and early 20th centuries who brought their discipline into line with the predominant Romantic-Positivism, and that the mathematical and surveying school ofJomard is still very much on the outside.

CHAPTER VI
HELLENOMANIA, 1
The fall ofthe Ancient Model,
1790 - 1830
T
HIS CHAPTER IS ALMOST entirely concerned with social and intellectual developments in Protestant North Germany during a period of forty years. The time-span may be short but it covers the French Revolution, the Napoleonic conquests, the crescendo of German nationalism against the French, the years ofreaction, and the establishment of Prussia as the dominant German state and the focus ofall German nationalism. It is precisely at this critical period that the new discipline ofPhilologie or Altertumswissenschafi (Science of Antiquity) was established as the pioneer discipline in the modem sense. It was the first to establish clear-cut meritocratic networks of student-teacher relationships, Seminars or departments capable of manoeuvring to secure as large a portion of state funding as possible, and journals written in a professional jargon designed to maintain barriers between the practitioners of the discipline and the lay public. I argue that the intellectual and academic developments have to be seen together with the social and political ones. It is striking to note that some of the key leaders on linguistic and historical issues, like Humboldt and Niebuhr, played active roles not only in setting up the new discipline but in the establishment of the new university system



BLACK ATHENA
as a whole. They were also important politicians on the national scene. It is extremely significant that the period of their greatest political influence was during the reforms which the Prussian government felt obliged to make after its catastrophic defeat by Napoleon's armies at Jena in 1806. The development and widespread promotion of the new AltertumswissenschaJt, which Humboldt put at the centre of his Bildung (educational formation), should be seen as one of these reforms. He and his friends saw of 'Antiquity in general and the Greeks in particular' as a way in which to integrate students and the people as a whole, whose lives they saw as being fragmented by modem society. More immediately, Humboldt and the others saw the study as a way of promoting an 'authentic' reform, through which Germany could avoid revolution of the type that so horrified them in France. From the beginning, then, AltertumswissenschaJt in Germany -like its equivalent, Classics, in England - was seen by its promoters as a 'third way' between reaction and revolution. In actuality, however, its effect was to shore up the status quo. The educational institutions and the Classical Bildungthat infused them became pillars of 19th-century Prussian and German social order. At the core ofAltertumswissenschaJtwas the image ofthe divine Greek, both artistic and philosophical. Greeks also had - like the idealized image of the Germans themselves - to be integrated with their native soil, and pure. Thus the Ancient Model, with its multiple invasions and frequent cultural borrowings and the implicit consequences of racial and linguistic mixture, became increasingly intolerable. It is only within this political and social context that one can understand the attack by one ofthe first products ofthe new system, Karl Otfried Miiller, on the overwhelming ancient authority-of the Ancient Model. In 1821, the year after the publication of The Minyans, the book in which he set out his arguments, the Greek War ofIndependence broke out and Western Europe was swept by Philhellenism. In such antiAsian and African Hellenomania, defence of the Ancient Model became almost unthinkable; paradoxically, its only major champion was the great ancient historian Barthold Niebuhr, who had done so much to introduce Romanticism and racism into the writing of history. After
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
Niebuhr's death in 1831 it became hard, if not impossible, for 'sound' scholars to argue that Egyptians had colonized Greece or played an important role in the formation of Greek civilization.
FRIEDRICH AUGUST WOLF
AND WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT
Having considered the 'fall' ofEgypt, we should now tum to the 'rise' of Greece. Christian Gottlob Heyne's best-known student, Friedrich August Wolf, studied at Gottingen only for the two years 1777-9. But from this experience, and from the Zeitgeist, he became in many ways the epitome of Romantic-Positivism. 1 He was a disciple of Winckelmann, a believer in staged history and a lover of Greece. A German patriot, he was deeply influenced by the movement for authenticity, with its emphasis on folksong. He also saw himself in the Romantic tradition of Homeric studies that we encountered in the discussion of Mme Dacier and Vico, and in this connection Wolfbelieved that he had an especial affinity with Bentley.2 Wolfbrought all these strands together. Setting his work in a context of detailed textual analysis, he envisioned the Iliad and the Odyssey as coming from the childhood of the Greek and, by implication, the European race. Basing himself on these feelings, and on the ancient tradition that Homer had been blind, Wolfwas convinced that the epics had been composed orally, long before the Greeks had possessed an alphabet.3 According to him, the epics were too long to have been the work of one illiterate bard. Hence they must have been created by a number offolk poets and put together only when they were edited or, as he supposed, first reduced to writing in 6th-century Athens. With these hypotheses Wolf arrived at the perfect Romantic conclusion. The Homeric epics should now be seen not as the work ofa single author but as the product ofthe childhood ofthe Greek/European Volk as a body.4 Many ofthese ideas came from the Scottish writers and from Robert Wood, the Romantic dilettante who - it will be remembered - had read the Iliad in situ. With his textual expertise and his status as a professor, however, Wolf gave them an academic authority which was essential in the new world of 'professional' knowledge.5 On the other hand, we



BLACK ATHENA
should not overlook the fact that on paper at least, Wolf's scholarship seems rather shallow. Although extremely stimulating, his Prolegomena to Homer has been regarded as a 'hurried piece' and his written works as a whole 'make little show in a library'.6
Wolf's achievement was in the tradition ofAltertumswissenschafi that he established. On his matriculation at Gottingen in 1777 he had called himself a 'student of philology', considered a radical step at the time.7 Later, however, he called the study of ancient texts - rounded out with Classical art and archaeology - Altertumswissenschafi, or 'science of antiquity'. Wolf has bqen called its founder, though he clearly derived the disciplinary form from his teacher Heyne and the content ultimately from Winckelmann, while the name was drawn from the new vocabulary of science and progress promoted in Germany by Kant.8 Wolf's forte was teaching, and as a professor at Halle in the I 780s he promoted both the new discipline and the seminar as a teaching method and as an institutional basis for research. Wolf's fame was secured by his connection with the young Prussian aristocrat Wilhelm von Humboldt.
Before examining their friendship and its extraordinary scholarly and institutional results, however, I want to consider for a moment the political positions of both Romantic Hellenism and Gottingen Positivism. These, as I have been arguing, were closely related. The proponents ofboth considered themselves 'progressive' and were in favour ofsmall 'free' states. However, there was considerable ambiguity on the meaning of 'free'. Furthermore, when the test came with the French Revolution, nearly all holders of these views and sentiments recoiled from it because ofits threat to privilege, its violence and what they saw as its 'unnatural' or 'inorganic' approach to 'freedom'. It is with this background in mind that one should view the reforms they planned and later carried out.
Wolf and Humboldt became close friends during 1792-3, at the height ofthe Revolution. From their discussions Humboldt produced a Skizze or sketch, 'On the Study of Antiquity and of the Greeks in Particular,.9 Although not published in his lifetime, it was read and criticized by Wolf and the great poet, playwright and philosopher Schiller. The sketch also became extremely important because it
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
expressed the ideas which Humboldt was later to try to put into practice as Prussian Minister of Education. Humboldt gave two justifications for making the study of Antiquity central in general education. There were obvious aesthetic reasons for studying the Greeks, he argued, but far more important was his faith that learning about the unalienated men of Antiquity would create a new society of better men today. Such a study would be the centre of Bildung, or educational and moral formation. With the Romantic concern for growth and formation through time, Humboldt valued the study ofthe Ancients not so much as a goal but as a process. He believed that grasping the complex organic development of Antiquity would somehow stretch and strengthen the creative powers of the student. lO It is possible that Humboldt originally intented this Bildung for the whole population. In the event, however, it became the stamp of a meritocratic elite.ll As such, it challenged the nobility. Its purpose was to reform Prussia within German culture, avoiding the horrors of the French Revolution. For 'On the Study ofAntiquity' was written during the trial of Louis XVI, about which Humboldt wrote at the time: 'this execution and horrible trial have left stains that can never be obliterated.,12 In France the upper classes read Barthelemy'sAnachanis as an escape from the tensions and horrors ofthe Revolution, and there is no doubt that study of the Greeks also provided an escape for Humboldt and his friend Schiller. 13 However, it was much more than that; they saw study and imitation ofthe Greeks as a way of transcending the extremes of revolution and reaction. Similarly, in Schiller's
famous series ofletters on the Aesthetic Education ofMan the fifth letter, concerning the chaos of the French Revolution, was followed by the sixth, on the harmonizing function of studying the Greeks.14
HUMBOLDT's
EDUCATIONAL REFORMS
Objectively, whatever their subjective political positions, Humboldt and Schiller helped defend the status quo. It was precisely to this kind of safe radical that the Prussian monarchy turned after the humiliation of the traditional government and its beloved army after their catastrophic



I 286 BLACK ATHENA
defeat by Napoleon at Jena in 1806. In 1809, among other reforms undertaken to face the French Revolutionary challenge, Humboldt was entrusted with the reorganization of the educational system. He based the new structure on Bildung, which he believed would reanimate the German people after their crushing defeats. In higher education he consciously rejected the French Polytechniques, with their emphasis on mathematics and natural science, in favour of schools teaching the much broader concept of Wissenschaft. Ostensibly the new Prussian curriculum was to contain the three disciplines ofmathematics, history and languages. !fIumboldt's priorities, however, can be seen from the fact that no mathematics was taught for the first five years at his chief creation, the new university at Berlin. 15
The leading scholar Humboldt recruited to Berlin was Wolf, who, as we have seen, introduced the Seminar, which spread from there to Prussia, then to Germany and then beyond. This system, with its insistence that students learn actively through their own research, would seem to give the students far more freedom and scope for originality than do traditional lectures. Over the past 180 years, however, while the form has produced great scholarly achievements, it .is apparent that it can be and is used as a very effective tool to control both the choice and the treatment of topics of academic concern. Wolf's practice ofAltertumswissenschaft followed that of Heyne and the Gottingen school. He rejected what he saw as the conceptualizing and abstract search for universals of the Enlightenment, in favour of direct confrontation with particulars and detailed source criticism. Completely oblivious to what can be seen, with hindsight, as his own intense Romanticism, he was able to write: 'All our research is historical and critical not of things to be hoped for but for fadS. Arts should be loved but history revered.' 16 This simple-minded approach has dominated the practice of most history and Classics ever since. Humboldt, at least by the end ofhis life, was far more sensitive. In his essay 'The task of a historian', he recognized that comprehension of the past required far more than external description. What was needed was a balance between 'rational observation' (beobachtender Verstand) and 'pqetic imagination' (dichtende
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
Einbildungskraft). The historian, however, unlike the poet, must subordinate his imagination to the investigation of reality, and 'must of necessity yield to the power of form, while keeping constandy in mind the ideas which are its laws.,17 In the 19th century these ideas certainly included the 'scientific laws of race'. Humboldt also tried to wresde with the difficulties ofthe relationship between subject and object in historical enquiry, which he believed required some feelings of kinship such as those existing between Germany and Ancient Greece. It was thus possible to write a history of Antiquity. At the same time, however, the Greeks were seen to transcend history. As he wrote in another piece:
Our study ofGreek history is therefore a matter quite different from our other historical studies. For us the Greeks step out of the circle of history. Even if their destinies belong to the general chain of events, yet in this respect they matter least to us. We fail entirely to recognize our relationship to them if we dare to apply the standards to them which we apply to the rest ofworld history. Knowledge ofthe Greeks is not merely pleasant, useful or necessary to us - no, in the Greeks alone we find the ideal ofthat which we should like to be and produce. If every part of history enriched us with its human wisdom and human experience, then from the Greeks we take something more than earthly - almost godlike. 18
Humboldt's view of the transcendent quality of Greek history was matched by his view ofits language. He saw Greek not as an Ursprache, or 'original language' like Sanskrit, but as a perfect balance between youthful vitality and philosophical maturity - reflecting the double qualities of aesthetics and philosophy that had been attributed to the Greeks since the 1780s.19 The central importance of language, its fundamental relationship with nation and national character, and the Romantics' fascination with all three have already been touched on.20 Humboldt, who though many-sided was fundamentally a linguist, tended to regard language as an essentially independent fixed variable.21 For him the nature of the Greek language was ofparamount importance. Furthermore, as always - or at least since the 15th century - concern with Greek paralleled that



288 BLACK ATHENA
with German.22 Thus with the crescendo of German nationalism towards the climax of the War of Liberation against Napoleon in 18I 3- 14 came an increasing glorification of the German language; its chief virtue was seen to be that it was, unlike French, somehow echt (authentic) and rein (pure).23
Well before this, in his Skizze of I 793, Humboldt had argued that the excellence ofGreek lay precisely in its being uncontaminated by foreign elements.24 Thus the superb linguist, who was particularly fascinated by the complexities oflinguistic mixing, suspended his critical faculties when it came to Greek, holding it as an article offaith that the language was 'pure'. This inherently implausible notion would have been considered absurd before the triumph of Romantic-Hellenism but, with ce,ain provisos, it now became canonical in Altertumswissenschaft and modem Classics. Since then only the names of clearly Oriental luxury goods have been exempted from the otherwise complete embargo on Afroasiatic loan words. . While Humboldt and other Romantics insisted on the infinite variety of societies, and the absence of the universals proclaimed by the Enlightenment, they saw a general direction provided by an inner order, supreme force or being.2s The Greeks were perceived as having transcended mundane chaos and being closer to the ineffable best. In some sense, then, they were themselves the human universal.
It was precisely this and their supposed transcendence of historical and linguistic laws that made the Greeks the central concern ofBildung, through which the young leaders of Germany were to understand and remake themselves. It was for equivalent purposes that Altertumswissenschaft and Classics spread to the rest of Europe and its offshoots beyond: despite its scholarly trappings, its role in the ideological formation of the ruling class has continued to be more important than historical or linguistic enquiry. Thus, while earlY-19th-century Philhellenism - though consistently racist - had both radical and reactionary aspects, the discipline ofClassics was conservative from the
start. The educational reforms ofwhich it formed the centrepiece were . 'd I 0' 26

[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
THE PHILHELLENES
To make some sense of the fall of the Ancient Model in the 1820S, we sh uld start by considering the general political and ideological en. • 0 oment in which the change took place. Central to it was the
movement which, in the 19th century, occupied what might called the 'radical wing' of the Romantic movement. Philhellenism tended to share the Romantic rejection of urban industrialization, the universalism and rationality of the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution. On the other hand, while the mainstream of Romanticism turned towards the medieval past and Christianity - especially Catholi. cism - Philhellenes were sometimes religious sceptics or atheists, and political radicals.27 As young men, for instance, Hegel and Friedrich Schlegel loved the Greeks, but as they grew older and increasingly conservative they turned to Christianity.28 The Left Hegelians, including Marx, preserved the young Hegel's passionate interest in Greece. The reason for the radicals' enthusiasm seems obvious. Compared to Rome - or, for that matter, Egypt or China - the Greek states were indeed models of liberty. Moreover, this tension within the Romantic movement has persisted. Both the revived public school system, in which the future leaders of England were supposed to become 'Christian gentlemen' by studying the pagan Classics, and the movement to create an Indo-Germanic or Hellenic Christianity, can usefully be seen as attempts to bring together these two wings of the Romantic movement.29 The experience of the French Revolution and the triumph of reaction after 1815 caused much bitter disillusion among upper-class Romantics. However, the love of freedom revived - if only in an alienated form - with the outbreak ofthe Greek War of Independence in 182 I, and the Germans were the nationality most quickly and deeply involved.3D Indeed, their movement in support ofthe struggle provided the only important centre for liberalism in the country: over 300 Germans went to fight in Greece, but they were only the tip of the iceberg in a movement that involved tens ofthousands, mostly students and academics.31 Many French and Italians also went, supported by numerous philhellenic committees; and the movement was even



BLACK ATHENA
powerful in the United States. Though only sixteen North Americans reached Greece, the widespread philhellenic feelings arising from the War provided a big boost for the 'Hellenic' - Greek letter - fraternities in the United States. The other chief influence on the American student organizations came from the book-burning German student fraternities revived between 181 I and 1819, by the eccentric teacher and promoter of exercise 'Father' Jahn, to support the Romantic nationalism of the War of Liberation. Fraternities in both countries have preserved this chauvinism with the strong physical and antiintellectual bias envisaged by their founders. 32 Britons, too, were deeply involved in the Greek cause. We have seen the English and Scottish poets had been passionately concerned with Greece since the mid- I 8th century. When the Parthenon or 'Elgin' Marbles were exhibited in London in 1807 there was a craze for pure Greek art, which had never before been seen there.33 Henry Fuseli saw the Marbles and shouted: 'De Greeks were godes. De Greeks were godes! ,34
Fuseli, ne Fiissli, was a Swiss artist and art historian living in London, where he promoted the ideas of Winckelmann. His passion for Greece and hatred of Egypt seem to have been equally intense. For him, Greece was 'that happy coast, where, free from an arbitrary hieroglyph, the palliative of ignorance, from a tool of despotism or a ponderous monument of eternal sleep, art emerged into life, motion and liberty.,35
It should be noted, however, that the idea of Greece emerging from Egypt implies an acceptance of the Ancient Model which later Philhellenes were unwilling to concede. Although Fuseli was foreign, his ideas on Greece were not that far from general cultivated opinion in the first quarter of the 19th century. With the beginning of the War in 1821, enthusiasm for Greece rose to fever pitch. As Shelley wrote:
We are all Greeks. Our laws, our literature, our religion, our arts all have their roots in Greece. 'But for Greece ... we might still have been savages and idolators . . . The human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in Greece which has impressed its
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
images on those faultless productions whose very fragments are the despair ofmodern art, and has propagated impulses which can never cease, through a thousand channels of manifest or imperceptible operation, to enable and delight mankind until the extinction of the
race.36
Hellenomania was well and truly launched! Despite Shelley's passionate eloquence and his dramatic drowning just when he was about to go to Greece, the most famous philhellenic poet of the Romantic age was Byron. It was no coincidence that he was from Scotland: the 18th-century links between that northern country and Romanticism have already been noticed. In the early 19th century they involved not only Byron but Sir Walter Scott, the herald of the medieval revival, and the invention of a fictitious sentimental national tradition at which even Scott baulked.37 Although a coarse Regency rake, Byron linked Scottish Romanticism to Greece. He had called for the country's independence a decade before the revolt broke out, and to crown it all- with mixed but essentially Romantic motives - he joined the War in order to die in it.38
Throughout Western Europe, the Greek War of Independence was seen as a struggle between European youthful vigour and Asiatic and African decadence, corruption and cruelty:
The barbarians of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane are revived in the 19th century. War to the death has been declared against European religion and civilization.39
Even in the 18th century, Turkish rule in Greece and the Balkans had begun to be seen as unnatural, the result of the conquest of a superior race by an inferior one. It will be remembered that Christian Bunsen placed the 'Turanians' or Turks between the Chinese and the Egyptians in his historical hierarchy ofraces; in the 19th century rule by this race was seen as bound to fail in the end, and could certainly never result in any advance of civilization. By the end of the century this principle was being applied systematically throughout history, and perceptions ofthe Arab and Berber rule of Spain provide a clear example of the change. Before 1860, English and



BLACK ATHENA
North American writers were sympathetic towards the Moors because Islam was less pernicious to them than Catholicism. By the end of the century, 'racial' considerations had transcended the religious ones; hence Arab rule of Spain was seen as sterile and 'doomed' throughout its 800 generally flourishing years.40 The intensification of these racial feelings with the Greek War of Independence thus had a direct effect on the Ancient Model. As first the Egyptians and then the Phoenicians were increasingly perceived as 'racially' inferior, the Greek legends of their having not only colonized but civilized 'sacred Hellas' became not merely distasteful but paradigmatically impossible. Like the stories of sirens or centaurs, they had to
be because and historical laws of19th-century sCience. Ob)ecnons to this picture were made still greater by another aspect of the change from the Enlightenment to Romanticism. Since the Enlightenment placed much emphasis on cultivation and improvement, it was no great slur on the Greeks for their civilization to be attributed to Egyptian and Phoenician colonization. Romantics, on the other hand, stressed nature and distinct, permanent national essences, so that it was now intolerable to suggest that the Greeks had ever been more primitive than Africans and Asians.

The Philhellenes were more concerned with the Classical Greeks than with their heroic, but superstitious, Christian and dirty 'descendants', whom some tried to explain away as 'Byzantinized Slavs'.41 Philhellenes sought the pure essence of Greece before it had been tainted by Oriental corruption, and with their apotheosis - as we have seen in Humboldt and Shelley - even the Ancient Greeks themselves began to fall short of the new exalted standards. These standards increasingly began to call for cultural, linguistic and finally 'racial' purity, and such new paragons had been found as early as the 1790S by Friedrich Schlegel in the Spartans or the larger tribal grouping to which they belonged, the Dorians. Elizabeth Rawson, the modem historian of the image of Sparta, has described Schlegel's writing about them:
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 293
From the start, however, language reminiscent ofWinckelmann on the Greeks in general is used for the Dorians; we are told of their miMe Grossheit, 'serene greatness', and indeed in contrast to the more easily Orientalized Ionians they form the older, purer and more truly Hellenic branch chiefly responsible for those two essential procedures for the Greek spirit, music and gymnastics.42
Notice that Schlegel and many other later writers took these two nonverbal, irrational and - dare I say it - 'German' aspects of Greek culture as the essential ones. Nietzsche's Birth ofTragedy, published in 1872, in which music and Dionysian tragic passion are emphasized over . Apollonian reason, is often seen as a radical break away from Winckelmann's view of the 'serene greatness' of the Greeks. In fact it belongs to a German tradition which goes back through the poems of Heine in the I 840s, to Heyne and the playwright Wieland in the 18th century.43
During the 19th and 20th centuries the German cult of, and identification with, the Dorians and Lakonians continued to rise until it reached its climax in the Third Reich.44 By the end ofthe 19th century some vo/kische (populist, nationalist) writers saw the Dorians as pureblooded Aryans from the north, possibly even from Germany, and they were certainly seen as very close to the Germans in their Aryan blood and character.45
Such enthusiasm was not restricted to Germans. As John Bagnell Bury wrote in his History of Greece, first published in 1900 and still considered standard,
The Dorians took possession of the rich vale of the Eurotas, and, keeping their own Dorian stock pure from the mixture ofalien blood, reduced all the inhabitants to the condition of subjects ... The eminent quality which distinguished the Dorians ... was that which we call 'character' and it was in Lakonia that this quality was most fully displayed and developed itself, for here the Dorian seems to have remained most purely Dorian.46
It is interesting to note that Bury - like many of the leading British Classicists of the tum of the 19th century, including John Pendand



294 BLACK ATHENA
Mahaffy and William Ridgeway - came from the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. All three men were enthusiastic about the pure northern, and possibly Germanic, blood of the Dorians. Thus, apart from participating in the general racism ofthe period, it is clear that they saw an analogy between the Teutonic English relationship with the Irish, whom they saw as 'marginally European', and that between the Dorians and their subject populations, the Pelasgian native inhabitants
and the Helots.47 Ridgeway was an altogether consistent racist who, though his family had lived in Ireland for 200 years, boasted that he had 'not a drop of Gaelic blood in his veins'.48 By 1900, then, the Spartans - the 'true' Greeks - were seen as racially pure and somehow northern. The situation was not so extreme in the early 19th century, tJvt the pressures were building up.
TRANSITIONAL FIGURES, I:
HEGEL AND MARX
Another prerequisite to examining the full-out attack on the Ancient Model in the I 820S is to look at thinkers who straddled the changes. To do this I have taken three examples: Hegel and Marx; A. H. L. Heeren; and Barthold Niebuhr.
Hegel was born in 1770 and was at the height of his power and influence in the 1820S, but he was not accepted by the philologists, whose power kept him out of the Prussian Academy for many years. Nevertheless, not only was he central to German philosophy of the time, but he also had a profound effect on the Romantic historians.49 There is also no doubt that Hegel was typical of his age. He loved Europe or, as he put it, the temperate zone; he respected the Asian mountains and India; he hated Islam and had complete contempt for Africa.5o His trajectory of the World Spirit from east to west obliged him to claim that being further to the west, Egypt was more advanced
than eastern India.51
Hegel's true feelings seem to emerge in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy, given between 1816 and 1830. In these he wrote at some length on Chinese and Indian thought, but touched on Egypt only when dealing with the origins of Greek philosophy:52
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 295
From Egypt Pythagoras thus without doubt brought the idea of his Order, which was a regular community brought together for purposes of scientific and moral culture ... Egypt at that time was regarded as a highly cultured country, and it was so when compared with Greece; this is shown even in the differences of caste which assume a division amongst the great branches oflife and work, such as the industrial, scientific and religious. But beyond this we need not seek great scientific knowledge amongst the Egyptians, nor think that Pythagoras got his science there. Aristotle (Metaph.l) only says that 'in Egypt mathematical sciences first commenced, for there the nation of priests had leisure.,53
Elsewhere Hegel wrote:
The name of Greece strikes home to the hearts of men of education in Europe, and more particularly is this so with us Germans ... They [the Greeks] certainly received the substantial beginnings of their religion, culture ... from Asia, Syria and Egypt; but they have so greatly obliterated the foreign nature ofthis origin, and it is so much changed, worked on, turned round and altogether made so different, that what they - as we - prize, know and love in it is essentially their own. 54
Thus, following the tradition from Epinomis, he admitted the massive borrowings but argued that the Greeks had qualitatively transformed them.55 Hegel's argument that the Orient was the childhood ofmankind and Greece its adolescence strongly resembles, of course, the views of the Young Hegelian Karl Marx.56 Marx argued that it was only in Greece that the individual had cut the umbilical cord from his community, and had changed from a Gattungswesen (species being) to a zoon politikon (political animal!city-dweller). With his lifelong love for the country, he completely accepted the prevailing view that in every aspect of its civilization Greece was categorically different from - and superior to all that had gone before.57 However, Marx went beyond this to claim just as clearly as Shelley had done - that Greece towered over its posterity. Such a claim then caused a problem, in that it made Greece

BLACK ATHENA
go against the stream of progress. In an attempt to deal with this Marx
wrote in the introduction to his sketched outline for Das Kapital, the Grundrisse:
In the case of the arts, it is well known that certain periods of their flowering are out of all proportion to the general development of society, hence also to the material foundation ... For example, the Greeks as compared to the modems or also Shakespeare.
He nevertheless saw the paradox that 'in their world-epoch-making classical stature ... certain ... forms ... ofthe arts are possible only at an underdeveloped stage of artistic development.'
Marx went on to argue that mythology was impossible once it had overtaken by reality, as with the triumphs of capitalist industry. However, he was adamant that mythology could be produced only by a given society, with its distinctive social forms:
Greek art presupposes Greek mythology, i.e. nature and the social forms already reworked in an unconsciously artistic way by the popular imagination. This is its material. Not any mythology whatever, i.e. not an arbitrarily chosen unconsciously artistic reworking of nature ... Egyptian mythology could never have been the foundation or womb of Greek art.58
My interpretation of this opaque passage, inasmuch as it concerns the theme of this book, is this: even in the 18sos when he wrote the Grundrisse, Marx was still sufficiently aware of the Ancient Model to have to face the possibility that Greek mythology - hence art - did not come from Greek social relations but from Egypt. To accept this would, of course, make nonsense of his scheme.59 And he was living in an age when everybody felt in their bones that Greece was categorically apart from, and above, Egypt. Thus the destruction of the Ancient Model gave his generation a freedom on this question that was not available to Hegel. Marx was able to deny Egyptian influence on Greece outright.
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 297
TRANSITIONAL FIGURES, 2:
HEEREN
A. H. L. Heeren was born in 1760, ten years earlier than Hegel, but he outlived him by eleven years, dying only in 1842. Heeren was a son-in-law of Heyne, and was a distinguished Professor of History at Gottingen in the 1820S and 30S. His scholarship, which focused on economic and technical developments, was exhaustive in the approved Gottingen fashion. Like his father in-law Heyne and his brother-in-law Georg Forster, Heeren was fascinated by the 18th-century explorations and his magnum opus, Reflections on the Politics, Intercourse, and Trade of the Principal Nations ofAntiquity, combined these explorations of Africa and the Near East with ancient writings on the subjects. His conclusions stressed the importance of Carthage, Ethiopia and Egypt, and - somewhat apologetically, because he admired Greece greatly - he felt obliged to retain the Ancient Model to explain the striking parallels he saw between these cultures and that of Greece.60
Heeren was not treated well by those ofhis contemporaries who have had an influence on posterity. Humboldt considered him a 'rather dull man', and he is best known today for the poet Heinrich Heine's merciless caricature of Heeren in his Pictures ofTravel.61 Heeren was punished by the Romantics not merely for his choice of subject but for
staying with the Ancient Model too long. Only black historians read him today. 62
TRANSITIONAL FIGURES, 3:
BARTHOLD NIEBUHR
Niebuhr's reputation has fared much better than that of Heeren. He is generally and rightly recognized as the founder of modem ancient history. But from the point of view of this book, the interesting thing about him is that he remained within the Ancient Model. I treat Niebuhr in some detail because he represented advanced German thinking at the tum of the 18th century, and because of his enormous influence on 19th-century understanding of ancient history and good



BLACK ATHENA
historical 'method'. Through him we can realize how saturated both were in Romanticism and racism. However, I have also included Niebuhr as a transitional figure, for although he provided massive help to the intellectual and ideological forces that overthrew the Ancient Model, he himselfwas still maintaining it at the end of his life. It is possible that he did so out ofhis intense conservatism at this stage, or for reasons of personal or professional rivalry. The cogency with which he argued in favour of the Ancient Model, however, suggests otherwise.
Barthold Niebuhr, born in 1776, had a wide Teutonic background. His family were Frisians of German culture living in Holstein, then in D)umark. His father, Carsten Niebuhr, was a famous traveller in the East employed by the Danish court and Gottingen. He was also an Anglophile and the boy's first foreign language was English while, almost alone in his generation, Barthold studied in Britain. Carsten Niebuhr also encouraged his son to read not only Latin and Greek, but Arabic and Persian as well. Thus Barthold had an exceptionally broad scholarly background. As a Wunderkind he was taken up by cultivated neighbours, including the Homeric scholarVoss and the Romantic poet M. C. Boie, both products ofGottingen.63 Barthold was in correspondence with Heyne, and both wanted him to study at Gottingen. Carsten Niebuhr, however, preferred to send Barthold to the University of Kiel, which was then Danish; this could lead to official posts in Denmark. From Kiel he went for a year to Edinburgh; he then spent six years in Copenhagen as an extremely successful civil servant specializing in finance and continued his studies, now focused on Roman history. In 1806 he joined the Prussian government at its lowest ebb, working for the reforms that helped the monarchy survive. Here too he made time for scholarship and in 1810-11 wrote his History ofRome, quickly recognized as being the foundation of modern and 'scientific' ancient history. Then in 1816 he was sent as the Prussian representative to Rome, where he remained until 1823. After that Niebuhr went into semi-retirement at Bonn where, though still deeply concerned with politics, he devoted most of his time to scholarship until his death at fifty-four, early in 183 I.
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 299
Niebuhr was primarily a historian of Rome. The reason for this concern has been explored by the intellectual historian Zvi Yavetz. Yavetz points out that the picture painted by the earlY-20th-century literary historian Miss E. M. Butler, in her great book The Tyranny of Greece over Germany, needs some qualification. Although, Yavetz admits, there had long been the special association with Greece, and the country had obsessed late- 18th-century Germans and its image continued to dominate 19th-century poets and 'progressives', the great conservative and liberal German historians concentrated on Rome - its rise and not its fall- which they identified with Prussia.64 Nevertheless, Niebuhr was also passionately concerned with Greece. It is worth spending some time considering Niebuhr's general ideological position. The Finnish scholar Seppo Rytkonen describes Niebuhr as a man who 'found his own way between the Enlightenment and Restoration'; however, Rytkonen's definition of 'the Enlightenment' is so broad as to include not only Montesquieu but Burke and the German conservative Moser.65 His notion of 'Restoration' is proportionately narrow. It seems to be restricted to the poetic and Indophiliac absurdities ofHeidelberg, ruling out the much more formidable Gottingen tradition to which Niebuhr so clearly belonged. The great Classicist Professor Momigliano, who towers over the history of Classical studies, is always eager to dissociate his discipline from Romanticism and German nationalism. He claims that the basis of Niebuhr's thinking came from English - not even British economists.66 Momigliano cites Niebuhr's protege F. Lieber to the effect that Niebuhr had told him that most of his British friends were Whigs and that Whigs had saved England in 1688.67 As most of Barthold Niebuhr's friends in Britain were men from the East India Company who had known his father Carsten, their political persuasion is not surprising. Furthermore, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was, for Niebuhr, the model of political change with minimal disorder. In his youth he had believed that this kind of event could take place only among superior northern races; by middle age, however, he despaired even of these. Frances Bunsen, the wife of Niebuhr's secretary, Christian - later Baron - Bunsen, who knew Niebuhr intimately after 18 I 6, described



300 BLACK ATHENA
him as the most rigid reactionary and as 'ultra-Tory'. She wrote that in general it was his 'inclination to trust government rather than the nations governed,.68 Niebuhr acted on these principles, and his contempt for Southern Italian 'Polcinellos', when he went beyond the call of duty as a Prussian official to help the Austrians crush the Carbonari rising in Naples in 1821.69 It also seems very likely that his early death was hastened, if not caused, by his terror at the French and Belgian Revolutions of 1830.70 Thus there is no doubt that after 1817 Niebuhr was reactiQnary even by the standards ofthe counter-revolutionary age, and that this affected his later historiography. Does this mean that he was already a conscious conservative in 181 1 when he first wrote his History? Rytkonen believes that Niebuhr's ideology seemed more conservative than it actually was, while Professor Momigliano refers to Niebuhr's early 'democratic sympathies' and his support for the liberation of serfs in Denmark and Prussia.71 In fact, Niebuhr's sympathies for the French Revolution were remarkably shallow and short-lived at a time when such sympathies were all the rage.72 Indeed, the idea that his conservative ideas were always fundamental is strengthened by the fact that they were those of his father. Carsten Niebuhr always disliked the French, and political disturbances of any sort. The combination of the two appalled him. Coming from peasant stock himself, Carsten had great sympathy with that class in his native Dithmarsch, which of course fitted the Romanticism of the times; in Barthold such feelings were reinforced by Carsten's friend Boie, who combined activity in poetic circles with passionate support for authentic 'German' freedom and opposition to the French Enlightenment.73
Momigliano sees Niebuhr's ideas as. containing a 'mixture of conservative and liberal attitudes quite unusual on the continent', this being 'a consequence of his British experience,.74 These ideas, however, appear to have been the same as those of his father and his circle, and were perfecdy Romantic. As a young man, Niebuhr seems to have believed not only that northern peasants were worthy of authentic traditional freedom, but that they could be a bastion against revolutionary and Catholic forces. 75 This combination of ideas occurred in Britain, but it was equally German and Scandinavian; hence there
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 301
would seem no reason to challenge mainstream historiography, which labels Niebuhr as a Romantic and a conservative.76 No one has ever compared Niebuhr to Adam Smith, Bentham or James Mill. The Briton he turned to was Burke. As he wrote in the introduction to the third edition of his History ofRome: 'Not one of the bases of the political judgement in my work cannot be found in Montesquieu or Burke.,77 The close parallels between Niebuhr and Burke have been accepted by virtually all writers - with the exception of Momigliano - from Baroness Bunsen and the conservative German nationalist of the late 19th century Heinrich von Treitschke, to the modem historians Witte and Bridenthal.78 Thus, as an example of Niebuhr's enlightened spirit, Professor Momigliano argues that he went to Edinburgh because, unlike London, it had a university. This practical reason may well have played a role in his decision, but Niebuhr told a friend that he was going to Scodand to learn the language of Ossian!79 While consistendy Romantic Niebuhr was, until about 1810, a reform-conservative, arguing for reform to save Denmark and Prussia from revolution. (It is in this context that his promoting the abolition of serfdom should be seen.) For these ideas he was sometimes attacked by the whole-hog reactionaries with whom he later sided.8o Rytkonen, for instance, maintains that Niebuhr was linked to the Enlightenment by his lack of historical relativism, and belief in an ahistorical human nature. At other points, however, he sees Niebuhr as having had a concept ofRomantic growth later overshadowed by a Traditionalismus, a 'stasis' very different from the permanent rational order to which the Enlightenment aspired.81 Niebuhr's cross-cultural comparisons were, moreover, within strict bounds. His central one - between early Rome and his beloved native Dithmarsch - was possible only because he viewed both peoples as purely authentic and the products oftheir environments. Thus here too he was in the mainstream ofRomanticism. At no point did he accept the universalism, deism or atheism and belief in reason of the Enlightenment, let alone the liberty, equality and fraternity of the Revolution. Furthermore Niebuhr's promotion of Romanticism was not restricted to his history. As mentioned in Chapter V, he presided over the German



302 BLACK ATHENA
community in Rome when it was the seedbed of the new Romantic movement. 82
How did Niebuhr's conservatism and Romanticism affect his writing ofhistory? Firstly, like Humboldt, he saw the broad study ofAntiquitywhich he still called Philologie - as a way of providing Bildung and so promoting the fatherland. 83 His method was that of the Gottingen source critics, a 'combination of rational criticism and imaginative reconstruction from text analysis, analogy and intuition'.84 Or, as the very favour.able article on him in the 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica described it: 'He brought in inference to supply the place of discredited tradition and showed the possibility of writing . . .,85 How these traditions had been 'discredited' was not specified, but clearly the least reliable were those that broke the canons of early-19th-century science - including its racial branch. This aspect of Niebuhr's method is linked to the crucial point, made by Momigliano, that Niebuhr was the first to challenge the great ancient historians on their own turf. Even Gibbon had only begun where Tacitus left off, but Niebuhr wrote on early Rome, which was well covered by Livy and others.86 Niebuhr took Humboldt's views on the necessity of inference and imagination a step further. He is cited by the earlY-20th-century intellectual historian G. P. Gooch as having written: 'I am an historian, for I can make a complete picture from separate fragments and once I know where the parts are missing and how to fill them up, no one believes how much ofwhat seems to be lost can be restored. ,87 Though cast in positivist terms, Niebuhr's is an honest confession and would seem to fit all historians. Even so, it is difficult to see how, ifhis method contained so much subjectivity, one can proclaim Niebuhr as the first 'scientific' historian and claim that he raised his discipline to a categorically higher plane, above such 'prescientlfic' historians as Herodotos, Thucydides, Sima Qjan, Tacitus, Ibn Khaldun, Voltaire, and Gibbon! All these, at least, wrote clearly! What were Niebuhr's specific contributions? At the time, and since, the best-known aspect of his work has been - pace Rytkonen and Momigliano - the hypothesis that Roman history had been taken from lost 'lays' or epic poems. As many writers have pointed out, Niebuhr's idea clearly derives from the Romantic belief in the centrality of
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 30 3
folksong at the origins of nations.88 Given his view of Niebuhr as essentially a product of the Scottish Enlightenment, it is not surprising that Professor Momigliano downplays the significance ofthe 'lays'. For him the most important innovation in Niebuhr's work was on a second topic: the nature of early Roman land law and the AgerPublicus (Public Field). He demonstrates that Niebuhr gained his ideas on this from information about India, which he learned from his father's Scottish friends. 89 Momigliano admits, however, that Niebuhr's motive for studying the topic was what he saw as the misuse of Roman precedents by the French Revolutionaries in their - very mild - land reform. As Niebuhr himself put it, he wrote to refute 'the mad and detestable sense given to the agrarian law by a criminal gang,.90
For Niebuhr Rome, like Britain, was a model of how internal conflicts could be worked out in a gradual and constitutional manner. In the development ofthis idea he introduced his third major new theory, which was that the Patricians and the Plebeians were not merely different classes but different races. The idea that class differences originated from race differences - which Niebuhr applied to other situations as well- had been used earlier in France; there the beliefthat the nobility were the descendants of the Germanic Franks, while the Third Estate were native Gallo-Romans, had played a significant role in the development of the Revolutions of 1789 and 1830. Still another pattern that is likely to have influenced Niebuhr is the Indian caste system, which is supposed to have originated from the Aryan conquest and to have been an attempt to maintain the purity of the conquerors. It was Niebuhr, however, who gave this theory academic cachet, and he was credited with having introduced it. The great Romantic French historian Michelet saluted Niebuhr tor having discovered the ethnic principle ofhistory 'as early as 181 1'.91 This was also the message taken from Niebuhr by his English disciple Dr Arnold, the famous headmaster ofRugby.92 Despite doubts abut the 'lays', the AgerPublicus, the racial origin of the Roman classes and another theory on the Northern origin of the Etruscans, the anonymous writer on Niebuhr in the 191 1 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica wrote:



BLACK ATHENA
if every positive conclusion of Niebuhr's had been refuted, his claim to be the first who dealt with the history of Rome in a scientific spirit would remain unimpaired, and the new principles introduced by him into historical research would lose nothing oftheir importance.
One of these 'new' principles was the Romantic-Positivist one, championed at Gottingen, of studying peoples and their institutions rather than individuals. However, Niebuhr was even more admired for his introductio.9-Qfrace into history:
By his theory of the disputes between the Patricians and the Plebeians arising from original differences ofrace, he drew attention to the immense importance of ethnological distinctions and contributed to the revival ofthese divergences as factors in modem history.
In addition, Niebuhr was adamant about the desirability ofnational and racial purity:
It seems to be the course ofthe history ofthe world that conquest and divers intermixtures are to fuse numberless original races together . .. Seldom will a particular people be the gainer by such an intermixture. Some sustain the irreparable loss of a noble national civilization, science and literature. Even a less cultivated people will hardly find that the refinements thus imported - which, moreover, if they are suited to its genius, it might have attained for itself - will make amends for the forfeiture of its original character, its national history and its hereditary laws.93
It is no surprise, then, that ancient historian Ulrich Wilcken - who flourished under the Nazis - was able to celebrate Niebuhr as a 'founder of critical-genetic historiography,.94 In a letter written to his
parents in 1794, when he was eighteen, Niebuhr described the deleterious effects of racial mixture, and there is no doubt that this Romantic ethnicity was based on what he saw as physical and fundamental racial differences. At this stage, at least, he believed in polygeny:
I maintain that we must make very cautious use of differences of language as applied to the theory of races and have much more regard for physical conformation ... [race is] one of the most
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
important elements of history still remaining to be examined - that which is, in truth, the very first basis upon which all history is reared and the first principle upon which it must proceed.95
Niebuhr's preference for physical rather than 'linguistic' racism may well have come from his father, and through him from the British in the East. It put him beyond Humboldt and the tradition later upheld by Niebuhr's own secretary Bunsen and the great French Semitist and historian Ernest Renan, which insisted that the manifest differences between peoples were caused not by physical conformation but by adequacy of language.96 Physical racism was essential to Niebuhr's principle of the racial nature of class, given that different classes and even castes speak the same languages. It is remarkable to note how constant he was to this principle, and also on the undesirability ofracial
mixture. Niebuhr brought together the Romanticism and the racism of the 1790S. The alliance was an easy one. In many ways Rasse (race) or Geschlecht (kind) were merely the 'scientific' terms for the Romantic Volk (people) or Gemeinschaft (community). In his classic statement of historicism and progressive relativism Also a Philosophy of History, published in 1774, Herder insisted that the Volk was the source of all truth.97 This notion appears in the 19th century as the 'racial truth' which supersedes all others.98 Despite the fundamental congruence between Romanticism and racism, there is a contradiction between the Romantic ideal of racial authenticity and the racialist right of a master race to conquer. Niebuhr's early belief in the desirability of backward peoples - that is,
Germans - developing autochthonous cultures did not extend to lesser, non-European breeds. In 1787, at the age of eleven, he supported the Austrians - for whom he otherwise had no great love - against the Turks, and in 1794 the worst insult he could devise for Revolutionary France was 'New Tartary,.99 In 1814 he called for European and Christian unity to fight Islam, and in lectures given near the end of his life he is recorded as having said:
European dominion naturally supports science and literature, together with the rights of humanity, and to prevent the destruction



iIl',: 'II
BLACK ATHENA
of a barbarous power would be an act of high treason against intellectual culture and humanity. 100
The occasion for this defence of imperialism was a future European conquest of Egypt. Like the Humboldt brothers and Bunsen - but unlike most German Classicists and Orientalists - Niebuhr accepted Champollion's decipherment. This led him to attack the great F. A. Wolf, who had, he said, 'investigated the antiquity ofwriting among the Greeks coIJlPJ.etely independently of the art in the East'; this one-sided view Niebuhr attributed to Wolf's 'prejudice against the high antiquity ofwritings in the East'. 101
Niebuhr, himself in touch with Rome, followed Champollion's compromise with the Church on the dating. 102 Thus he put Egyptian history back to 2200 BC, the date then assumed for the Hyksos. However, showing the cultural, racial and temporal arrogance or Bessenvissen ofthe critical method, which has been a bane to the writing of ancient history ever since, he claimed that the thirteen dynasties reported before the Hyksos had been invented by the Egyptians, who 'ought to have been contented with possessing a history as far backwards as the age of Abraham, but they wanted to ascend still higher in accordance with the spirit of Eastern nations.,103
Niebuhr was also in the Romantic-racist mode when he made a categorical distinction between the free and creative Greeks and the Egyptians, who, 'like many oppressed people, were very far advanced in their arts while their intellectual culture remained behindhand.'104 He also attacked the Phoenicians for their rootlessness. This cardinal sin against the Romantic canon was, of course, used against the Jews until the triumph of Romantic Zionism, and there is no doubt that Niebuhr shared the growing anti-Semitism ofhis social circles. lOS
Nevertheless, as I have said, Niebultr remained within the Ancient Model. In his attack on Wolf, he wrote:
Admitting that .... intolerable abuse has been made of the influence exercised upon the Greeks by the Eastern nations ... Wolftoo much ignores the fact that relations did exist between Greece and the East and that, though afterwards they were independent, in earlier times the Greeks were influenced and instructed by Eastern nations. 106
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
Niebuhr believed that the myth of Kekrops' Egyptian settlement at Athens in some way reflected Egyptian influence there, as did the legends of Danaos and Aigyptos for the Argolid. He had no doubt whatever about Kadmos' foundation of Thebes. 107 There is, on the other hand, a tone of defensiveness in these assertions that must be attributed to the influence of Wolf and his ideas and, in the 1820S, of Wolf's follower Karl Otfried Muller. I shall return to Muller after considering the first 19th-century attack on the Ancient Model, that of the Abbe Petit-Radel.
PETIT- RADEL AND THE FIRST
ATTACK ON THE ANCIENT MODEL
Petit-Radel was a scholar greatly interested in art and architecture. In 1792 he emigrated to Rome, already the centre ofRomantic aesthetics, and while in Italy he became fascinated by the country's pre-Roman ruins. Following an ancient tradition he called these 'Cyclopean', seeing them as irregular and hence 'free' in a way that Egyptian and Oriental architecture was not. 108 On the basis of the occurrence of these buildings, he became convinced that a common European
civilization had been established in both Italy and Greece before the . dPh" 109
arrival of the EgyptIans an oemClans. In 1806 Petit-Radel presented a paper, 'On the Greek origin of the founder of Argos', to the Institut de France in Paris. His argument was based on the early dating by Dionysios of Halikarnassos, a Greek historian ofthe I st century BC, of an Arkadian settlement in Italy which Petit-Radel linked to the Cyclopean buildings. The Frenchman attacked Freret and Barthelemy, as exponents of the Ancient Model, regarding the cultural level of the native Greeks when the Egyptians had settled. He backed this view with his contention that the Cyclopean architecture antedated the arrival of the Egyptians, and his Romantic faith that the glorious Greeks could never have been so backward. In addition, Petit-Radel specifically challenged the traditions that kings Inachos and Phoroneus of Argos had been Egyptian. 110 He showed how weak this tradition had been in Antiquity - and it is true that even among the shadowy figures ofthe legendary period, these two

are outstandingly murky. The tone ofthe paper casts some doubt on the extent ofhis boldness, as there are suggestions that what he was saying I hi P .. d' III Th
was we come to s anslan au lence. e paper appears to have been well received, and Petit-Radel went on to playa distinguished role in Restoration academic life.
KARL OTFRIED MULLER
AND THE OVERTHROW
OF THE ANCIENT MODEL
Where Petit-Radel tried to bypass ancient authority and the Ancient Model, the first direct challenge to them came from Karl Otfried Muller. In general terms, there is no doubt about the Romanticism of Muller's scholarship and life. The earlY-20th-century historian of Classics Rudolf Pfeiffer saw him as the 'radiant figure ofa happy young scholar', while to the otherwise sober English intellectual historian G. P. Gooch he was 'the Shelley ofthe modern renaissance, the young Apollo in the historical pantheon,.II2
Muller was one of the first generation to be trained in Humboldt's educational system. Born in Silesia in 1797, he studied at its capital, Breslau, attending the new Seminar which had been established on the Berlin model. His teacher, Heindorf, was an estranged pupil of Wolf, and Muller himself worked for a year under Wolf in Berlin. Although Muller thoroughly disliked him, his writings are, nevertheless, permeated with Wolf's influence. For both men, the key words were the Kantian Prolegomena and Wissenschaft.1l3 Adopting Wolf's progressive and scientific mode, Muller stressed the pioneering nature of his own studies, which he believed would be superseded by the collective labours oflater scholars. But, while deferential to the future, he was arrogant towards the past. The only previous works he considered worthy offavourable note were publications from Gottingen and the writings of French Royalist scholars like Petit-Radel and Champollion's great enemy, the Classicist Raoul Rochette. In this contempt, Miiller was a perfect example of the professional 19th-century philologists who despised the generalist b-udits or Gelehrte of the 18th century whom they were replacing. I14
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
Muller's thesis was a local history of the island of Aigina. Though partly inspired by the marbles recently brought to Germany from there, the project was a perfect example of Romantic-Positivism. First, as Gooch pointed out, this first local history ofAncient Greece resembled the first German one: that of Osnabriick by the Romantic conservative Justus Moser.115 Secondly, Aigina is an island - the perfect finite space and convenient for exhaustive study. Still more significant is the fact thatit was inhabited by Dorians and faced Athens, the chief city of the
'corrupt' Ionians. On the strength of this work, and at an astoundingly young age, MUller was appointed to a chair at Gottingen. This, in a surprisingly Hebrew turn of phrase, he called 'the place of places for me'.116 From then on his academic position - unlike that of many of his contemporaries - was secure. He received money and recognition from the governments of Hanover and other German states until his untimely, but Romantic, death from fever in Athens in 1840.117 Despite his professionalism, Muller's scholarly range was prodigious. He was able to round out philology in the approved new manner, and as well as producing a major work on the Etruscans he wrote voluminously on ancient art and archaeology. I18 The works that
became the pillars of Altertumswissenschaft, however, were his Histories of Greek Tribes and Cities, published between 1820 and 1824, and his Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology, published in 1825. His attack on the Ancient Model was explicit in both. The first volume of his Histories of Greek Tribes and Cities, Orchomenos and the Minyans, began with a quotation from Pausanias:
Greeks are terribly prone to be wonderstruck by the expense of home-products; distinguished historians have explained the Egyptian Pyramids in the greatest detail and not made the slightest mention of the treasure house of Minyas [at Orchomenos] or the walls of Tiryns, which are by no means less marvellous. 119
The quotation is pivotal: it directs the readers' attention both to the Minyans, whom Muller saw as an invading northern tribe related to the Dorians; and it denounces what he believed to be the besetting sin of the Greeks, later given the pathological names 'Egyptomania' and



310 BLACK ATHENA
'barbarophilia,.I20 These disorders were manifested in the 'delusion' that Egyptians and other non-European 'barbarians' had possessed superior cultures, from which the Greeks had borrowed massively. Miiller had enemies on two fronts: the Ancient Model and the uses made of it by the Masons and Dupuis; and the Indophilia of Schlegel and the Romantic Heidelberg group around the mystical philosophers and mythologists Creuzer and Garres. Where Schlegel had seen Egypt as an Indian c.ol?ny, Creuzer - seeing otherwise inexplicable similarities between Indian and Greek religion, especially in their symbolism went on to argue, completely without evidence, that Indian priests had somehow brought their philosophy to Greece.121 Although - unlike the champions ofthe Ancient Model- they were certainly more influential in Germany after 1815, the Indophils could provide no specific evidence of transmission for Miiller to attack. 122
In dealing with the Ancient Model, Miiller frequendy referred to the Verbindungen (combinations) and Verknupfungen (liaisons) between Greek and barbarian priesthoods. These, he maintained, had suggested fundamental relationships between the various religious systems and myths. According to Miiller, it was these 'late' contacts that had created the false impression that Greece had derived its religion, myths and civilization as a whole from the Near East, and here his main technique for removing what he saw as these late ;f(;cretions was the 'argument from silence'.123 In principle, he recognized that genuinely ancient traditions sometimes appeared only in 'late' sources - indeed, he himself sometimes relied on such evidence. Thus, to deny the authenticity of a legend he required an additional criterion: that there must have been a strong contemporary reason for fabricating it.124 In practice, however, lack of attestation alone was seen as damning, especially when Miiller was attacking the Ancient Model. Indeed, he and his successors have employed Homer and Hesiod not as broadranging poets but as encyclopaedias. In this way the common phrase 'unknown to H.' was used not in the sense 'unattested in the surviving corpus of H.', but to mean'did not exist in the time of H.'. Miiller's second technique for demolishing the Ancient Model was dissection or analysis: he maintained that this was rectifying what he saw as a general tendency in Antiquity towards syncretism. 125
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 3 11
Championing Romantic particularism against Enlightenment universalism, he argued that 'Separation, therefore, is one main business of the mythologist.'126 Reduced in this way to local specifics, the earliest myths could be viewed as rooted in the soil of Greece. Nevertheless, Miiller maintained that there was need for 'combination' not of the 'late' or priesdy kind already mentioned, but through tracing cultic and mythological patterns that had spread with conquering
races. The prime example of this process was what Miiller saw as the association between Apollo and the Dorians - that the cult of the god had spread with the Dorians' conquests. Such an interpretation was typical of the general Romantic belief that vitality flows from north to south and not vice versa}27 In this way, Miiller maintained that if similar cults, myths or names were found in Greece and the Near East, they must be Greek; while if they had existed in Greece and Thrace or Greece and Phrygia, which were to the north-east of Greece, they originated from the latter. I28 The same was true within Greece, according to Miiller: if similar features were found in both the north and the south ofthe country, they nearly always came from the former. Furthermore, if cults or names were widespread in Greece or the Aegean, they had to be indigenous and not the result of foreign introduction. Miiller's first attack was against the legends surrounding Kekrops and his supposed colonizations of Athens and the region of Lake Kopais in Boiotia, which included Orchomenos, the city after which the first volume of his History was named.129 These traditions were only attested 'late', thus fulfilling Miiller's first condition of spuriousness. There were also close relations between Greeks in general and Athens in particular and the Egyptian 26th Dynasty, 664-520 Be, whose capital was Athens' sister city thus satisfying his second. Furthermore, Miiller pointed out that the main sources of the legend were a book claimed by Pausanias to have been a forgery, and stories told to Diodoros by Egyptians, whose manifest self-interest discredited them.130 What is more, Herodotos, who firmly believed in foreign setdements elsewhere, saw Kekrops as autochthonous. l3 1 Finally, Miiller quoted Menexenos, in one of Plato's dialogues, to the effect



312 BLACK ATHENA
that the Athenians were pure-blooded, unlike the Thebans and the Peloponnesians, who had been colonized by Easterners.132 Miiller did not refer to this passage when challenging the legends surrounding Danaos' acquisition ofthe Argolid; he did this by showing genealogical discrepancies in the mythic cycle. He also maintained that Danaos could not have been Egyptian because he was the eponym ofthe Danaans, who were clearly Greeks.133 However, he admitted that 'While Kekrops' Egyptian origin is merely historical sophism, that
of Danaos -'isgenuine myth.,134 Miiller could hardly avoid the concession, since he knew about the lines referring to Danaos' daughters from the Danais epic.135 This, however, did not grant the legends historical status, given the 'facts' of the general north-south direction of cultural flow and 'the Egyptian abhorrence of all travel and seafaring'. 136
Miiller conceded that the legends surrounding Kadmos presented even more difficulties. In the first place they concerned the Phoenicians, whom he saw as an 'active merchant people [who] were more ancient than the ... xenophobic and bigoted Egyptians' .137 Nevertheless, convinced ofthe permanence ofnational characteristics, Miiller thought it inconceivable that seafaring merchants could have conquered inland Thebes. He attacked the legends around Kadmos by separating the alleged Phoenician colonies in Boiotia from those in the Aegean. He then dismissed the legends of ancient as opposed to 'later' Phoenician settlements on Samothrace and Thasos in the Northern Aegean, because Herodotos had seen the ancient cult of the Kabeiroi there as Pelasgian. Here, although he did not admit it, Miiller was in difficulties, because 17th- and 18th-century scholars knew that the name Kabeiroi came from the Semitic kabir (great) - the Greeks called them Megaloi Theoi and the Romans Dei Magni, meaning 'Great Gods'.138 Miiller preferred to derive the name from the Greek kaio (burn), linking it to the undoubted associations between the· cult and metalwork. He also pointed out a connection between Kadmos and Kadmilos, one of the Kabeiroi, and noted that the latter was worshipped near Thebes. However, instead of seeing the cult in both places as Near Eastern, he used the 'proof' that the Aegean one was Pelasgian to argue that the cult
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I 3 1 3
and the name Kadmos at Thebes came from the same 'substratum' and therefore had nothing to do with Phoenicia.139 At the time, this confused and confusing argument was no more successful than Miiller's attack on the Indophils and, as on the latter, his views on the Phoenicians became predominant only in the 20th century. In 1882, for instance, the great Classicist and Indo-Europeanist Hermann Usener attacked Miiller's denial of the 'now obvious influence of the Middle East'.140 Miiller did better with the Egyptians. F. C. Movers in his The Phoenicians, published in the 1840S, tried to salvage the legends of Danaos on the grounds that Danaos' Hyksos connections made him Semitic, not Egyptian; but he was largely discredited, and by 1840 it became impermissible to accept any story of Kekrops' Egyptian origin.141 Thus, after Miiller, all 'reputable' scholars have worked in what I call the 'Broad Aryan Model', believing that while there mayor may not have been Phoenician settlements on Mainland Greece, there were certainly no Egyptian ones. Most later historians, and some ofhis contemporaries, have regarded Miiller as essentially Romantic in maintaining a categorical distinction between Greek and other cultures. In Orchomenos he denied the charge and, after apologizing for having treated Greek mythology as if it were all mythology, he claimed that Greece was part of the world, and that therefore Greek mythology had the same basis as that of the rest of mankind. 142 What he objected to was the belief in colonial bonds and the wholesale borrowing of Greek religion and mythology from the East. He was convinced that he had shown these to be unhistorical, though illusions about them had led all previous research astray. In Prolegomena, Miiller made an eloquent appeal for scholars to do what he had failed to do, and investigate all mythologies for insights into the Greek one.143 The 'anthropological' school of the Cambridge Classicists James Frazer and Jane Harrison, which flourished at the beginning of the 20th century, in no way overstepped these bounds. 144 What Miiller outlawed was any special relationship between Greek and Eastern myth. Indeed, as he put it, 'the entire book is opposed to the theory which would make the majority of myths importations from the East.' He continued with a splendid example of RomanticPositivism:



BLACK ATHENA
In order to assume this just for one [myth] even, distinct proof is required either ofso great internal agreement as only to be explained by transplantation or, secondly, that the mythos is absolutely without root in the soil of local tradition, or, lastly, that transplantation is expressed in the legend itself.145
A demand for 'distinct proof', as opposed to competitive plausibility, is dubious in any branch of knowledge. It is absurd in such a nebulous region as the origins of Greek mythology. Muller's second sleight of hand was to switch the onus of such 'proof' on to proponents of the Ancient Model. As the earlY-20thcentury scholar Paul Foucart argued, it would be more reasonable to require proof from those who challenge the ancient consensus that there had been Near Eastern colonization than from those who defend it. l46 The fact that Muller's bluff was so successful only shows how much his audience, during and after the Greek War of Independence, wanted to hear it. With Muller's capture of the academic 'high ground' from which he could demand 'proof' from challengers, the destruction of the Ancient Model was secure. Miiller admitted that one of the best ways of distinguishing the historical elements ofmyth or legend was through etymology, especially the etymology of names.147 He himself was make very little headway with this in the case ofGreece, and after some feeble attempts he exclaimed:
But alas! Etymology is still a science in which blind guesswork is more practised than methodical investigation; and in which because we wish to explain everything too soon, our labours more frequently result in confusion than elucidation. 148
This failure explains why, as two ofMuller's modem admirers put it, 'philology in Muller's work is usually subordinate to mythology.,149 Typically, however, Muller had faith iri the advance of science: 'yet ... there is no folly in hoping for still more solutions from this quarter'.150 Unfortunately for the Aryan Model, however, IndoEuropean philology has failed, over the last 160 years, to be of any help in explaining Greek myth and religion. This state of affairs is in striking
[CH. VI] HELLENOMANIA, I
contrast to the hundreds of plausible etymologies from Semitic and Egyptian.151 Many of these, including those for Thebes, Kadmos, Kabeiroi and the element Sam - in Samothrace - were known to Muller, but he seldom confronted them directly, preferring to dismiss them out ofhand. 152
Now we come to the later reception of Miiller and his ideas. He was admired in his own time; his was the first memorial tablet erected in Gottingen in 1874, and by the end of the 19th century he was

considered a pIOneer 0 mo em ancIent story. n IS IS ory OJ Classical Scholarship, published in 192 I, the great WilamowitzMoellendorf said, after mentioning Miiller's name, 'We have at last

ancIent wor y sCIence was comp ete . We should note that this statement - apart from the colonizing image it conjures up - casts Muller as the heroic figure in the conventional history of science, who turns chaos and dark into order and light and creates a new scientific field. And in the field ofmythology, this image of him was well established during his lifetime. Thomas Keightley's The Mythology ofAncient Greece and Rome, published in 1831, and William Smith's Dictionary ofGreek and Roman Biography and Mythology, which appeared between 1844 and 1849, both took on his new methods. The historian of Classics F. M. Turner refers to Keightley and Smith as 'serious British commentators on Classical myths',155 while the mainstream of students of mythology continue to accept Miiller's self
definition as 'scientific', and consider him a 'serious' and 'scrupulous' c. d fth· d' . l' 1'\6

BLACK ATHENA
scholars. None of the 19th-century extensions of knowledge was involved. Naturally he could not take into account the reading of cuneiform or Schliemann's archaeological discoveries - these took place after his death. However, unlike Heyne and Heeren, he was not particularly interested in the 18th-century explorations; and unlike Humboldt, Niebuhr and Bunsen he disregarded the sensational scholarly developments between 1815 and 1830. There is no indication that he paidany attention to Champollion's decipherment, and his hostility to India meant that despite his close contact with the Grimm brothers and other Indo-Europeanists, he did not apply the new Indo-European linguistics to his work. All this means that the destruction of the old model took place entirely for what historians of science call 'externalist' reasons. The Ancient Model fell not because of any new developments in the field but because it did not fit the prevailing world-view. To be more precise, it was incompatible with the paradigms of race and progress ofthe early 19th century.
CHAPTER VII
HELLENOMANIA, 2
Transmission ofthe
new scholarship to England
and the rise ofthe
Aryan Model, 1830-60
T
HE FIRST HALF of this chapter is concerned with the transmission of Miiller's work to England. This has to be seen in the context of the introduction of Altertumswissenschaji to England and the establishment of the discipline of Classics, in which contemplation of all aspects of Greek and Roman life was supposed to have a beneficial educational and moral effect on the boys who were to be the rulers of Britain and the Empire. Classics became the centre ofthe reformed public school system, and dominant in the universities. These reforms were led by Dr Arnold and other early Victorian reformers who saw in German education and
scholarship a 'third way' that broke away from the stagnation of Tory and Whig England while avoiding French radicalism. However, as with Humboldt and his colleagues in Germany thirty years earlier, there is no doubt that the English reformers were much more afraid of revolution than of reaction. This did not, however, save them from attack by conservatives. Connop Thirlwall and George Grote, the two men who challenged Mitford's defence of the Ancient Model, belonged to slighdy different factions of this reforming elite. Both were very impressed by Miiller's work, but both shied away from his iconoclastic radicalism. Thirlwall



BLACK ATHENA
refused to reject the Phoenician settlements, while Grote cut the Gordian knot and completely refused to speculate about the veracity of the Greek legends about their past. Despite the differences in their approaches, the net effect oftheir work was to discredit the traditions of colonization and to enhance the independent creativity of the Greeks, who were now looked upon as semi-divine. This, of course, was very welcome to public opinion, which was becoming increasingly Philhelleneand contemptuous of all non-European cultures. The second part of Chapter VII is concerned with the reconciliation of Indophilia and Indo-European studies with Philhellenism and Altertumswissenschaft. After Miiller's demolition of the Ancient Model, it was relatively easy to fill the vacuum with the model ofIndo-European conquest from the north. In this case, unlike the destruction of the Ancient Model, there was a good internalist explanation for the change: the need to explain the Indo-European basis of Greek. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that German and English scholars were particularly attracted to ideas of northern invasion, which fitted so well with the prevailing racism and with Niebuhr's scheme ofethnic history. There is also no doubt that the contemporary passion for India drew Europeans' attention to the Aryan invasions of the subcontinent from the north. It took very little imagination to transpose fro!D these invasions - which are attested in Indian tradition - to Greece, where there were no extant records of such a conquest.
THE GERMAN MODEL
AND EDUCATIONAL REFORM
IN ENGLAND
Just as Isokrates had viewed the Athenians and Greeks in the 4th century Be, so by the beginning of the 19th century AD Germans were convinced that they were the 'intellectual instructors of mankind'.1 It was a self-assessment accepted by most 'progressive' Europeans and North Americans. German philosophy and education provided a middle way between bankrupt traditions and the French Revolution and atheism. As the contemporary literary historian Elinor Shaffer writes about one aspect ofit:
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA,2 3 19
The German criticism was learned and technical, unsuitable to sen:e the handbook of a working-class movement . .. moreover, It
as .. . was susceptible ofmanyinterpretations, among reform from within that left ecclesiastical and pohncal mstltutlons apparently intact, and real power where it was before. From the 1830S in England knowledge of the advanced. scholarship was a stick to beat the AnglIcan academtc establisht The nature of this mode of thinking tells us much about
men ... the double face of political Romanticism and even more about the nature of Victorian compromise. From one point of view it might be seen as a major intellectual monument to bourgeois h .2
ypocnsy.
In France this Germanic trend is best represented by the popular philosopher and politician Victor Cousin, who flourished under the grand bourgeois, compromise regime of Louis Cousin lished French primary education on the Prussian model, and like Humboldt, whom he greatly admired, he reserved a special place in whole educational system for the Ancients, and for the Greeks m particular. He was also an ardent believer in the categorical distinction between the primitive, 'spontaneous' philosophy of the East and the
'reflective' philosophies of the pagan and Christian worlds.3 While some English reformers were ready for the Prussian Bildung almost as soon as it was articulated, the power ofconservatism held back the 'Germanizing' ofeducation for many decades. In fact, it could begin only in the second third of the century, after nonconformist and industrialist pressure had forced the establishment of new universities, and the need for reform of the public schools and Oxbridge became blatant. Even after the university reforms, however, Seminars did not take root, and professors at Oxbridge were prevented by the Colleges and liberal feelings among the reformers from establishing an autocracy of the German type.4 Furthermore, in England, the Bildung of the German system was taken much more seriously than its research. It is striking thatJowett, the leading Classicist in the second halfofthe 19th century, left a lasting impression on his students but was much competent as a scholar than many of his unreformed predecessors.



320 BLACK ATHENA
The production ofresearch from the English universities was negligible compared to that ofthe formidable German professorate.6 Study of Latin as a language and reading of the Ancients had been central to the basic curricula of medieval universities. In England the relative importance of these aspects of education grew during the 18th century with the decline ofthe interest in religion and theology and the disdain for mathematics shown by the increasingly aristocratic students. Moreover, as we have seen, after 1780 more attention began to be paid to Greek. Knowledge of Latin had always marked the upper classes; now Greek became the inner or first circle. Nevertheless, the first use of Classics - the study ofall aspects ofAntiquity as moral and intellectual training for the elite - emerged only in the first halfofthe 19th century, directly or indirectly following the German pattern.
The most prominent figure in its promotion was Thomas Arnold, best known as the promotor of that improbable hybrid, the 'ChristianGentleman'. As headmaster of Rugby and with a keen interest in university reform, he became immensely influential in the last ten years or so of his life, between 1832 and 1844. Like Humboldt and Cousin, Arnold belonged to what one might call the pugnacious middle, hating both revolution and reaction.7 Central to all his ideas ofreform for the purpose ofpreserving the best oftradition was his love of Germany: he had met Bunsen in Rome in 1827 and the two became fast friends; and, though somewhat concerned about Niebuhr's historical scepticism, he became a fervent admirer and wrote a popular digest of his Roman History.8 Arnold also shared Niebuhr's enthusiasm for race as the primary principle ofhistorical explanation, and his inaugural lecture as Regius Professor ofModem History at Oxford in 1841 was devoted to this theme.9 Dr Arnold and his son Matthew are especially significant because of their 'trendiness'; they articulated and reinforced feelings already present in fashionable opinion. IO
A much more original group of scholars emerged from Cambridge. Indeed, the possibility of reform ,in this slightly more flexible Whig university is shown by the fact that the Classical Tripos ofthe modem, 'all-round' type was established there in 1822; and it was through Cambridge that the new German scholarship and AltertumswissenschaJt were introduced into England. The key figures in their transmission
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA,2 321
were two close friends at school and university,Julius Hare and Connop Thirlwall. Hare had spent time as a child in Germany, where he learnt German and developed a lifelong enthusiasm for its culture, which he passed on to Connop Thirlwall. Together with the mathematician William Whewell, they were active in the first attempt to found the Cambridge Union and after the student debating society was closed down in 1817 as subversive, Whewell and Thirlwall devoted themselves to learning German from Hare. By the time he went down the following year, Thirlwall had not only learnt German but had read Niebuhr's History. He soon went to Rome, where he attached himselfto the German community and established a friendship with Bunsen that 'had a most important influence on his life'.11 On his return to England Thirlwall translated St Luke, a difficult theological treatise by Schleiermacher, a Romantic and 'Aryanist' theologian who was a favourite of Humboldt and Bunsen. I2 This caused a mild scandal among conservative clerics opposed to all German theology, but it did not prevent Thirlwall's returning to his college, Trinity, and taking the required holy orders. In 1827 he and Hare began the translation of Niebuhr's History; one volume appeared in 1828, a second three years later, but their extraordinary patience and dedication were exhausted and the third was left unfinished. By 1830, Thirlwall and Hare had come into contact with a small exclusive and secret student society, the Apostles, which had been founded as a Christian social club ten years earlier. They helped to transform it and give it the distinctive metaphysical liberal character that-with some deviations-has lasted ever since. The two encouraged the younger 'brethren' to revere the Romantic poets and German scholarship.13 According to a member elected in 1832, 'Coleridge and Wordsworth were our principal divinities and Hare and Thirlwall were regarded as their prophets'; another source claimed that 'Niebuhr was for them a god who for a lengthy time formed their sentiments.' 14 The Romantic ethos of the group was intensified in 1833 by the death of Hallam, a brilliant young man loved by Thirlwall and many of the brethren; his cult, symbolizing their own lost youth and beauty, was immortalized in Tennyson's In Memoriam and remained central to 'the Society' for the next forty years.



322 BLACK ATHENA
There is no doubt that Thirlwall saw himself as the Sokrates of the group, consciously training the best minds ofthe younger generation to feel Romantically and think sceptically. Thus from the Apostles in particular, and the Zeitgeist in general, Romantic-scepticism became the ethos of what the contemporary social historian Noel Annan has called the 'intellectual aristocracy' or the 'new intelligentsia'. 15 Indeed, Thirlwall's Sokratic reputation was increased by his principled stand for the admission of dissenters to Cambridge degrees. Let down by Hal'e'\and betrayed by Whewell, he was forced to resign his fellowship. His hemlock, however, was not so bitter since he had Whig friends in high places: he immediately received a rich living in the East Riding which gave him the leisure to .write his History of Greece.
In 1840 Thirlwall was appointed Bishop of St Davids, the most ancient see in Wales. This must be seen as one of a series of proGerman moves that included th°e appointment of Dr Arnold to the Regius Professorship and Bunsen's special mission from the Prussian government to England to further his great religious scheme - which had strong Teutonic racial overtones - to unite the Lutheran and Anglican Churches. The scheme took tangible form in the foundation ofthe joint Evangelical bishopric and it was this move that finally drove the future Cardinal Newman to Catholicism. His conversion provides a good illustration of the division within the Romantic movement between the 'progressive' lovers of Greece and Germany, and the 'reactionary' passion for Christian ritual and the Middle Ages that could lead the unwary to Rome. As a bishop, Thirlwall championed the liberalism of the 'new intelligentsia' and its ecclesiastical wing, the 'Broad Church'. In this he was often alone, and his first action astounded his peers. He was the only bishop to vote in favour of civil rights for Jews. His motives for making this brave stand were mixed. They combined genuine liberalism with the belief that assimilation would be the fastest road to conversion. (Conversion of the Jews was in fact a major purpose of the Evangelical bishopric atJerusalem.)16 For the rest of his life, Thirlwall continued to combine this principled liberalism with unpleasantness to all around him, apart from children and pets.
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA, 2 32 3
Through all his courageous reformism - culminating in an extraordinarily eloquent speech in which he routed the champions of antidisestablishmentarianism - it must be emphasized that Thirlwall remained a Romantic and a counter-revolutionary. His Primitiae, essays written at the age of eleven, were fulsomely praised by the Anti-Jacobin Review and were dedicated to Bishop Percy, whose Reliques ofAncient British Poetry we saw as having been central to the Romantic interest in ballads in both Britain and Germany. Then, during the 1820S, he and Hare revered Wordsworth and Coleridge in the poets' extreme reactionary phases. Thirlwall was also terrified of the revolution he thought he detected in the Daughters of Rebecca - Welshmen who dressed up as women to burn hated tollbooths - and during the American Civil War, much as he deplored slavery, he found still more alarming the prospect of an 'ascendancy of a military democracy in which the basest bear rule'.17 Furthermore, he had what his friend Thomas Carlyle described as 'almost frantic apprehensions of the French menace'.18 All in all, Thirlwall's political views seem to have been close to those ofBunsen, Thomas Arnold and the young Niebuhr. Thirlwall's eight-volume History ofGreece, which began to appear in 1835, was the first major work in English to incorporate the results of the new German scholarship. It was also the first to replace Mitford's massive History, published between 1784 and 1804. However, the attack on the conservative Mitford, who was very sceptical of Greek achievements, had begun ten years earlier during the Greek War of Independence in reviews appearing in 1824 and 1826. The first, by Thomas Babington Macaulay, was a ferocious critique on the extremely reactionary anti-Athenian and pro-Spartan views he attributed to Mitford. Above all, however, Macaulay objected to Mitford's having treated the Greeks as just another people: like Shelley, or Schiller and Humboldt in Germany, Macaulay was convinced that the Greeks were above such forms ofanalysis. As he put it, when thinking about Greece, he loved to 'forget the accuracy of a judge in the veneration of a worshipper'. 19 0
The second attack, in 1826, came from George Grote, a young radical banker. Grote had read Mitford more carefully than Macaulay and conceded that Mitford was not pro-Spartan and -like Aristotle



BLACK ATHENA
had actually favoured mixed constitutions. What Grote objected to was what he saw as Mitford's pro-English bias and his failure to recognize the special nature of Greece which he, Grote, derived from its free institutions: 'It is to democracy alone (and to that sort ofopen aristocracy which is, practically, very similar to it) that we owe that unparalleled brilliance and diversity ofindividual talent which constitutes the charm and glory ofGrecian history.' He went on to make the circular argument that Greece should be given special treatment because its special posit\on was already institutionalized. He stressed 'the extraordinary interest which the Classical tum of English education bestows on all Grecian transactions ...,20 Thus both critics agreed that Ancient Greece should be placed beyond the normal bounds of scholarship. Macaulay went on to other things, but Grote pursued his mission, and twenty years later produced his own massive history of Greece.
Before that, however, Thirlwall's had appeared. The usual comparison made is that while Mitford's conservative scorn for Greek democracy made his work a 'five-volume tract' for the Tory Party to which Grote's History was a Radical challenge, Thirlwall's is supposed to have held the balance.21 On the issue that concerns us, however, the contrast is between Thirlwall's and Grote's attack on the Ancient Model and
(,
Mitford's defence of it. As we saw in Chapter III, earlier scholars, accepting the Model without question, had never needed to justify it. By the 1780s, however, Mitford had felt obliged to articulate a defence of the orthodox view that Greece had been colonized by Egyptians and Phoenicians. There was every reason to believe the Greek reports of colonization, he had argued, because they were so detailed and widespread, and because the Greeks would have been unlikely to invent stories that were against their own interest.22
Against this plausible case Thirlwall summarized Miiller's arguments, though without mentioning him by name. He also added a fascinating note on Miiller's motivation:
In a comparatively late period - that which followed the rise of historical literature among the Greeks - we find a belief generally prevalent, both in the people and among the learned, that in ages
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA, 2 32 5
ofvery remote antiquity, before the name and dominion ofthe Pelasgians hacl given way to that ofthe Hellenic race, foreigners had been led by various causes to the shores of Greece and there had planted colonies, founded dynasties, built cities, and introduced useful arts and social institutions, before unknown to the ruder natives. The same belief has been almost universally adopted by the learned of modern times ... 1t required no litde boldness to venture even to throw out a doubt as to the truth of an opinion sanctioned by such authority and by prescription of such a long and undisputed possession of the public mind, and perhaps it might never have been questioned, ifthe inferences drawn from it had not prfJVoked ajealous enquiry into thegrounds on which it rests. (my emphasis) 23
Thirlwall did not specify what these inferences were but, given Miiller's work, it is hard to see any alternatives to Romantic and racial ones. This statement by someone in close contact with the German scholars is important, because it suggests that the criticism was applied not because there were formal inconsistencies - as Miiller himself claimed in the case of Danaos - but because the legends' content was objectionable. Thirlwall continued:
When, however, this spirit once awakened, it was perceived that the current stories of these ancient settlements afforded great room for reasonable distrust, not merely in the marvellous features they exhibitbut in the still more suspicious fact thatwith the lapse oftime their number seems to increase and their details [seem] to be more accuratelyknown and that the further we go backthe less we hear ofthem, till, on consulting the Homeric poems, we lose all trace oftheir existence.z.4
Like Miiller before him, Thirlwall was unable to find any explicit challenge to the Ancient Model among the early Greek writers and was forced to make do with the 'argument from silence'. Thus he claimed to detect a 'tacit dissent' from Greek authors, and believed that the legends were 'refuted by the silence of the older Greek poems and
historians' .zs In true Apostolic spirit, Thirlwall could usually see two or more sides to any question, and on this one he seems to have been torn between



BLACK ATHENA
Miiller's radical yet satisfying conclusions, and the orthodoxy which Niebuhr had defended. Thus he wrote: 'it seems possible and even necessary to take a middle course between the old and the new opinions.,26 His compromise was the standard one - Egyptians no! Phoenicians maybe? - and he denied the truth ofthe legends surrounding the Egyptian Kekrops and Danaos on racial grounds: 'settlers of purely Egyptian blood, crossing the Aegean and founding maritime cities, appears inconsistent with everything we know about national characters.,27 Note the 'purely' and the 'maritime'! Thirlwall chose his
wopis very carefully, to avoid contradiction by the contemporary actions of Mohamed Ali and Ibrahim, but this systematic racism shows how easily ideology can transcend mere facts. 28
On the other hand, Thirlwall did accept the legends concerning Kadmos and the Phoenicians, not only in the islands but in Boiotia too. Another reason for distinguishing him from the late-19th- and 20thcentury racists and anti-Semites is that, although a true Romantic who talked in terms of 'blood' and 'race', he was insisting in the 1830S that
It is in itselfofvery little importance whether a handful of Egyptians or Phoenicians were or were not mingled with the population of Greece. All that renders this enquiry interesting is the effect which the arrival of these foreigners is supposed to have produced on the
state of society in their new country.29

Such a lack of concern with purity was much less acceptable eighty years later.
GEORGE GROTE
Thirlwall's History was soon eclipsed by that of George Grote, which appeared in 1846. The two men had been near-contemporaries at school at Charterhouse, and Grote claimed that he would never have begun his project if he had known about Thirlwall's. Thirlwall, for his part, accepted his supersession with striking cordiality.30 Momigliano has pointed out the similarities between Thirlwall's circle and that of Grote's banking Radicals: 'Both societies disliked Mitford, read German, and were attacked by the Quarterly Review. Both aimed at
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA,2 32 7
liberalization of English political and intellectual habits and wanted them to be founded on firm philosophical principles.,31 Yet Momigliano went on to claim a fundamental difference: while Thirlwall and Hare wanted to introduce a Romantic philosophy of history and replace the empirical studies carried on at Oxbridge, Grote was himself an empiricist and a positivist.32 In fact the distinction between the two should not be taken too far. Many Utilitarians shared the Romantic passion for Greece, which by the 1830S and 40S was held by women and men of all shades of opinion, except for extreme reactionaries. (Momigliano cites John Stuart Mill on Greece, but the Hellenic passion of Mill's Utilitarian father - who had his son taught Greek at three! - is still more telling.)33 Grote's admiration for the Greek polis, for instance, seems in many ways similar to that of Rousseau. Indeed, as Momigliano points out, Grote's 'sympathy for small states ... led him later to make a close study of the politics of Switzerland.,34 On the other hand, as a Radical and a Utilitarian, Grote was naturally in sympathy with the scientific spirit which, in the 1830s, was being articulated in France in the positivism of Comte. Grote was thus able to demand 'proof' from ancient history with more consistency than either Niebuhr or Miiller, and he deplored what he saw as the 'German licence to conjecture,.35 Momigliano maintains that Grote, by making a sharp distinction between legendary and historical Greece, 'broke with K. O. Miiller and his English admirers,.36 However, Miiller began his Prolegomena with the that there was 'a tolerably distinct boundary' between the two.37 Also, both Miiller and Grote followed Wolf in believing that writing had not existed in Greece before the 8th century and that there had been no priestly instruction, as there had been in the East. Thus the links with earlier times were extremely tenuous.38 Furthermore, both men agreed that while myth could contain historical elements, it was not useful to think of a nucleus of pure reality upon which mythical elements had been imposed; rather, the two elements should be seen as having been integrated from the beginning.39 Here too, then, the distinction between Grote and the Romantic historians does not seem to be as great as Professor Momigliano supposes. There was, however, one important difference between Grote and the German Romantics,



328 BLACK ATHENA
who were concerned with Greece as the infancy ofEurope: as a Radical rather than a conservative he did not regret the passing of the mythopoeic age. LikeJames Harris the grammarian a century earlier, Grote's passion was for the late and sudden flowering of Athenian democracy and, as we have seen, his main concern was to refute Mitford's Tory scepticism about Greek institutions.4O Momigliano also argues that Grote was stricdy neutral on the question of the historicity of Greek myths: it was simply that he demanded 'collateral evidence' before accepting them.41 Apart from the inappropriateness of this requirement of 'proof', Grote's neutrality on this issue is in serious doubt, because the tone of his discussion of hist9ricity is sceptical, if not scoffing. Thus he· approvingly cited the late-18th-century historian and mythographer Jacob Bryant, who had argued that it was impossible to take seriously the accounts of people who believed in centaurs, satyrs, nymphs and horses that could speak.42 Byrant's argument would seem plausible. It should, however, be remembered that every period has general beliefs which in later times are considered absurd. I maintain that in this case, what we now believe to be the mistaken beliefs in centaurs and other mythical creatures are less misleading - on the issues with which we are concerned - than the 19th-century myths on race, unchanging national characteristics, the productiveness of purity and the deleterious effects of racial mixture and, above all, the semi-divine status of the Greeks, which made them transcend the laws of history and language. Thus, while we should be wary of the ancient reports, we should have a still greater suspicion of Igth- and earlY-2oth-century interpretations of them. Momigliano claims that because of his 'neutrality', Grote's views on mythology have in no way been invalidated by later archaeological discoveries that would seem to confirm legendary accounts.43 This excuse does not apply if, as I maintain, his views were sceptical. Moreover, such scepticism seems more justifiable in Grote than in his 20th-century successors: having been bitten over Troy, Mycenae and Knossos and so on, one would expect them to give the benefit of the doubt at least to those traditions that were uncontested in Antiquity. It would have seemed prudent, for instance, to have retained as working hypotheses the idea that Boiotia had a special relationship with
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA, 2 3 2 9
Phoenicia, or that the lengendary Sesostris and Memnon - the Egyptian pharaohs called Senwosret and Ammenemes - had made widespread expeditions around the East Mediterranean in the 20th century BC rather than denying them as absurd, only to be humiliated when archaeological or inscriptional evidence is found to confirm both
traditions.44 Nevertheless, Grote's contempt for tradition's failure to satisfy the requirements of'proof' has been immensely influential. His insistence _ added to that ofMuller - that Greece must be assumed to have been isolated from the Middle East until proven otherwise has been useful as a tool to expel heretics from the Aryan Model out of the academic fold.45 Similarly, by starting Greek history with the first Olympiad in 776 BC, Grote powerfully reinforced the impression that Classical Greece was an island in both space and time. Greek civilization was seen to have come from nothing, springing up almost fully armed in a way that was rather more than human. Grote's history immediately became standard for scholars, not only in England but in Germany and elsewhere on the continent.46 Exhilarating as Grote's procedure on myth might have been, however, it did not satisfy other historians, who still felt obliged to present some opinion on early Greek history. In general they seem to have followed Thirlwall's compromise position: that while Greek legends maintained that there had been both Egyptian and Phoenician invasions, the 'scientific' evidence oflinguistics now suggested that the Greek language was pure and autochthonous. Sir William Smith's History ofGreece, the standard English textbook on the subject from its first publication in 1854 until the I 880s, demonstrated the difficulties of this position:
The civilization ofthe Greeks and the development oftheir language bear all the marks of home growth, and were probably litde affected by foreign influence. The traditions, however, of the Greeks would point to a contrary conclusion. It was a general belief among them that Pelasgians were reclaimed from barbarism by Oriental strangers, who setded in the country and introduced among the rude inhabitants the first elements of civilization. Many of these traditions, however, are not ancient legends but owe their origin to a later age.47



330 BLACK ATHENA
Given the ideological roots of the notion of the 'purity' of the Greek language, discussed in Chapter VI, it is fascinating to note that language, several decades later, was being used as the 'scientific' basis for the denial of the Ancient Model. Like Thirlwall, Smith had made the compromise of accepting the Kadmeian Phoenician settlement of Thebes while rejecting any stories of Egyptian colonization. While Romantics had toyed since the 18th century with the idea of a northern origin for the Greeks, scholarly attacks on the Ancient Model, from Samuel Musgrave to Karl Otfried Muller and Connop Thirlwall, had insisted on the autochthony of the Greeks and on the affinities between Hellenes and Pelasgians. By the 1850s, the Indo-European language family and the Aryan race had become established 'facts'. With a coherent racial theory, and the concept of an original Aryan lromeland somewhere in the mountains of Central Asia, the picture of Greek origins was transformed.
ARYANS AND HELLENES
Niebuhr, Miiller and the Indo-Europeanists had, between them, provided all the elements necessary for the construction of the Aryan Model. Niebuhr had made it legitimate to reject ancient sources, and had introduced the French and Indian models of northern conquest into Antiquity. Miiller had removed the Ancient Model from Greece. More powerful than either of these, however, had been the work of linguists in relating Greek to Sanskrit, and making it clear that Greek was an Indo-European language. Some historical explanation of this relationship was necessary, and the model of northern conquests from Central Asia fitted well. Thus a clear distinction has to be made between the fall of the Ancient Model, which can be explained only in externalist terms - that is, through social and political pressures - and the rise of the Aryan one, which had a considerable internalist component - that is to say, developments within scholarship itself played an important role in the evolution of the new model. I also want to emphasize that the Ancient and Aryan Models are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, for much ofthe 19th century the two coexisted in what I call the Broad Aryan Model. This held that the
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA,2 33 1
early Greeks, who emerged as the result of Indo-European conquest of Pre-Hellenes, had been conquered again by Anatolians and Phoenicians, and the latter left significant cultural traces. I myself argue, in my Revised Ancient Model, that there may well have been early invasions or infiltrations by Indo-European speakers into the Aegean basin before the Egyptian and West Semitic colonizations.48 On the whole, however, the supporters of the Aryan Model have been concerned with racial hierarchy and racial purity, and the idea of Egyptian and Phoenician colonization always seems to have been
distasteful to them. There was one great drawback to the new Aryan Model: the lack of ancient attestation. Thucydides had mentioned tribal movements in which the Hellenes from northern Greece had moved south and absorbed other peoples. His dating of this process is obscure, but he emphasized that it had not been completed at the time of the Trojan War; this left the origins of the Danaans, Argives, Achaians and many other Greeks unexplained.49 Similar problems oflateness mar the other possible tradition ofnorthern conquest - the Return ofthe Heraklids or the Dorian Invasion - in which tribes from the north-west of Greece swept south and captured most of the Peloponnese and much of the South Aegean. These events were consistently reported to have happened after the Trojan War, which took place around 1200 Be. Thus - if one accepted them as constituting the 'Aryan Invasion' - Agamemnon, Menelaos and most of the Homeric heroes could not have been Greeks. This was a price few Hellenists were willing to pay, even before the decipherment of Linear B proved that Greek was being spoken in Greece long before the Trojan War.so Hence the only possibility has been to argue that the Dorian Invasion was only the last in a series of invasions - but this still leaves the initial conquest unreported. Ernst Curtius, Miiller's devoted junior colleague, admitted that there was no ancient authority for the Aryan conquest and, as he put it, 'the notion of autochthony is developed among them [the Greeks] in the greatest variety of traditions.,s1 However, Philologie was now a 'scientific' discipline and was above such things; lack of ancient authority did not bother the new historians. As Theodor Mommsen, the great



(

,I
33 2 BLACK ATHENA
historian ofRome ofthe mid- and late 19th century, is reported to have written: 'History must first make a clean sweep ofall these fables which, though purporting to be history, are little more than improvisations.,52 Given the rise of Indo-European studies, the saliency of the Indian Model of Aryan conquest, and Miiller's destruction of the Ancient Model, the application of an Aryan Model for Greece was so obvious that it appears to have occurred generally in the 1840S and 50S. It is, therefore, difficult to know to whom to credit it. The most likely candidates, however, are the Curtius brothers, and breaking the rule of primogeniture we will consider Georg the younger first.
Georg Curtius was born in Liibeck in 1820, studied at Bonn and Berlin and was a professor at Prague .(already a great centre of linguistics), Kiel and Leipzig. His many books were applications ofthe
new of Indo-European linguistics to Greek. He worked on comparatIve grammar and on the Indo-European component in Greek, in both of which he set out the elegant and regular sound shifts according to which much ofGreek can be derived from the hypothetical
Proto-Indo-European.s3 During the 18sos Georg Curtius established a firm basis beyond which it has been hard to go. The earlY-20thcentury lexicographer H. Stuart Jones described the situation in the 1920S in his preface to the 9th edition of the standard Greek-English dictionary of Liddell and Scott:
After careful consideration, it was decided that etymological information should be reduced to a minimum. A glance at Boisacq's Dictionaire etymologique de la langue grecque will show that the speculations of etymologists are rarely free from conjecture; and the progress of comparative philology since the days of G. Curtius (whose Griechische Etymologie was the main source drawn upon by Liddell and Scott) has brought about the clearance ofmuch rubbish,
but little solid construction.54
This is as true today as when he wrote it in 1925. Much of the
'rubbish' was, of course, Semitic, which was impossible to tolerate in the I 92os.55
. IfGeorg Curtius linked Greece to the Indo-Europeans linguistically, his older brother Ernst did so historically. Ernst Curtius was born in
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA, 2 333
1814. He studied at Bonn and at Gottingen, where he became attached to Miiller. He spent the years from 1836 to 1840 in Greece and was with Miiller when he died. Curtius wrote a detailed historical description of the Peloponnese and gained a post at Berlin; he was next a professor at Gottingen from 1856 to 1868; he then took up a chair at Berlin and spent the last twenty-eight years ofhis life there.56 Ernst Curtius shared Miiller's passion for the landscape of Greece and for its monuments, archaeology and art. His was thus the first major history ofGreece to be written by someone who had actually been to the country. Moreover, Curtius always maintained his mentor's romantic view of Greece. As Wilamowitz-Moellendorf points out, he 'never outgrew his faith in that ideal conception, but proclaimed it to his dying day.,s7 Unlike Miiller, however, Curtius was swept up in the new enthusiasm for Indo-Europeans and Aryans, and his Romanticism was extended to them. Such a vision permeates his History of Greece, the first volume of which was published in 1857. Curtius accepted the linguists' idea of an Indo-European Urheimat somewhere in the mountains ofCentral Asia; it was from there that, just as the Aryans had swept south to conquer India, the Hellenes had descended into Greece. Unlike the Ancients and his predecessors, however, Curtius emphasized the distinction between Pelasgians and Hellenes: 'The Pelasgian times lie in the background - a vast period ofmonotonony: impulse and motion are first communicated by Hellen and his sons; and with their arrival history commences.,58
This view would seem to parallel the distinction between Aryan and non-Aryan. In fact, however, Curtius saw the Pelasgians as a first wave ofinferior Aryans who came through Anatolia and over the Hellespont to Greece, leaving traces in Phrygia. The later Hellenic invasions were smaller, but 'though less in number they were, by their superior mental powers, rendered capable of collecting scattered elements ... advancing it to a higher development.,59 The analogies between the pre-Dorian natives of Sparta and Messenia and the 'off-Aryan' Irish have been mentioned on p. 294.60 Curtius' historical scheme of Aryan Hellenes conquering semi-Aryan Pelasgians has the advantage of combining two ideologically desirable features - northern



334 BLACK ATHENA
conquest by a master race, and the preservation of essential racial purity.
The new invaders were thoroughly northern. One of their groups 'took the land way through the Hellespont's ancient portal of the nations: they passed through Thrace into the Alpine land of Northern Greece, and there, in mountain cantons, they developed their peculiar life in social communities ... under the name ofDorians.,61 The reason
for this picturesque description of isolated mountain life in 'cantons' _ making them almost Swiss - seems to have come from the longstanding Romantic need to derive a people's character from the landscape of its homeland. It was an embarrassment for proponents of such a view to find that the 'soft' Ionian Athenians were formed in rugged Attica, while the Spartans lived in the lush valley ofthe Eurotas. Cu9fus was much more brief on Ionian origins, noting simply that the Ionians had come straight from Phrygia to the east coast of the Aegean.62 Greek tradition stated clearly that Anatolian Ionia was settled by Ionians from Greece only in the I I th century, but Niebuhr had defied the Ancients on this point. In this way Curtius had the authority of the new scholarship behind him when he denied the tradition and claimed that Greeks had lived there much earlier. In conclusion to this section he argued that their separate migrations had differentiated the Dorians from the Ionians: hence 'the first foundations had been laid of the dualism which pervades the whole history of this people.' They were, however, racially united: 'an inner sense ofkinsmanship attracted them to one another. ,63
Above everything else, Curtius' mystic feelings about the Aryan Hellenes were concerned with language:
The people which knew in so peculiar a manner how to develop the common treasure of the Indo-Germanic language was ... the Hellenes. Their first historic deed is the development of this language, and this deed is an artistic one. For above all its sistertongues the Greek must be regarded as a work of art . . . if the grammar oftheir language were the only thing remaining to us ofthe Hellenes, it would serve as a full and valid testimony to the extraordinary natural gifts ofthis people ... The whole language resembles
[CH. VII] HELLENOMANIA,2 335
the body of a trained athlete, in which every muscle, every sinew, is developed into full play, where there is no trace oftumidity or ofinert material, and all is power and life.64
This 'pure' language had to be fully formed in northern mountains before the descent into Greece. Curtius saw this early completion as especially necessary, for he believed that languages were direcdy related to landscapes: 'One class of sounds is wont to predominate on the hills, another in the valleys, and again another on the plains.,65 It was unthinkable that such an object of beauty and purity as the Greek language could have developed on the Mediterranean; still less could it be the result of Hellenes mixing with Egyptians and Semites. Curtius did admit that in early times, Phoenicians had traded in Greece and had introduced certain new inventions. He maintained, however, that they had soon been driven out by the more dynamic Ionians. And he was convinced that the legends of Egyptian and Phoenician settlement had been demonstrated by 'racial science' to be absurd:
It is inconceivable that Canaanites proper, who everywhere shyly retreated at the advance of the Hellenes, especially when they came into contact with them, when far from their own homes; and who as a nation were despised by the Hellenes to such a degree as to make the latter regard intermarriage with them in localities of mixed population, such as Salamis or Cyprus, as disgraceful; it is inconceivable, we repeat, that such Phoenicians ever founded principalities among a Hellenic population.66
The anti-Semitic implications of this passage, and the very different attitudes towards the Phoenicians held in Britain at the time, will be discussed in the next chapter. For his part, Curtius explained away the references to the Phoenicians in a manner similar to and equally as cumbersome as Bunsen's. According to Curtius,· the Greek traditions of Phoenician settlement had arisen either from a natural confusion between Phoenicians and Ionians who had been abroad and learnt some foreign ways, or from the 'facts' that Caria had been called Phoinike and the Carians seem to have been a type of Eastern Greek.67



BLACK ATHENA
The only exception he allowed was Crete, where he admitted the actual Phoenicians might have settled in larger numbers, although they never displaced the native Pelasgians there.68 In the 1850s, with the island still under Turkish rule, this did not seem improbable; it was only after Evans' discovery of 'Minoan' civilization on the island in 1900 that
Crete became a territory too valuable to be conceded to the Phoenicians.
I should like to conclude this chapter with a vignette. The fonnidable and bigoted William Ridgeway has been mentioned above, in connection with the image of Spartans as Ulstennen. He was the dominant figure in early Greek history at Cambridge at the beginning ofthe 20th century.69 In his Early Age of Greece, published in 1901 , he gave his intellectual pedigree when he referred to: 'four historians whose scepticism or sober-mindedness no one has yet called into question _ Niebuhr, Thirlwall, Grote and E. Curtius,.70 No one can doubt their scepticism towards theories they did not like. On the other hand there is also no doubt that all were racist and that all were Romantics with a love for their images of Greece. It must now be clear that I
should like to call their sober-mindedness, balance and objectivity into question.
CHAPTER VIII
THE RISE AND FALL
OF THE PHOENICIANS,
1830 - 85
W
E NOW COME to an intenned.iate stage in the of the Aryan Model: Egyptian involvement in the fonnanon of Greece had been dismisse<\, while that of the Phoenicians was still generally admitted. I argue in this and the following chapters that the essential force behind the rejection of the tradition of massive Phoenician influence on early Greece was the rise ofracial- as opposed to religious - anti-Semitism. This was because the Phoenicians were correcdy perceived to have been culturally very close to the Jews. In the intennediate period with which we are concerned, however, the situation was complicated by another parallel seen between past and present - that between the English and the Phoenicians, the proud manufacturing and merchant princes of the past. This identification was accepted both by the English and by their enemies - the French at the beginning of the 19th century and the Gennans at its end. Thus there were distinct differences in the historical treatment of the Phoenicians on the opposite sides ofthe Channel: the English tended to admire them, while the continentals were more or less violendy hostile. French interest in the Phoenicians increased with their colonial and military involvement in both Lebanon (the old Phoenicia) and North Africa (the new one). French hostility to the Phoenicians came to a



BLACK ATHENA
climax in Flaubert's enormously popular historical novel Salammbo, which vividly portrayed the luxury and cruelty of Carthage in the 3rd centuryBc.
Salammbo also spectacularly raised the issue of the horrible ritual.of Moloch and the sacrifice of the first-born that is mentioned so often in the Bible. Flaubert's spectacular reminder of the association of the Carthaginians and the Phoenicians with this ultimate abomination made it difficult even for British andJewish scholars to champion them. The last three sections of the chapter are concerned firstly with Gobineau's views of Greece as a largely Semitized and hence corrupt culture; and secondly with Schliemann's discovery of Bronze Age 'Mycenaean' civilization and the discussions about the racial and linguistic nature of its rulers and inhabitants. I am particularly concerned, here, with the widespread beliefthat the whole culture was heavily 'Semitized'.
The third and final topic is the influence on historiography of the East Mediterranean of the decipherment of cuneiform and the discovery first of the Semitic-speaking Assyrians and Babylonians, and then 6f'the non-Semitic Sumerians. By attributing all aspects of Mesopotamian civilization to the Sumerians, the anti-Semites who by the I 890S dominated much ofthe writing ofancient history were able to maintain their general tenet that Semites were essentially uncreative.
PHOENICIANS AND
ANTI -SEMITISM
There has always been considerable overlap between religious hatred of the Jews and ethnic hostility to them. Nevertheless, it is equally true that there was a shift in emphasis during the 19th century from the traditional Christian JudenhafJ (hatred ofthe Jews) to a modern 'racial' anti-Semitism. The transition was a complicated process, however, and it took place at various speeds in aifferent places. In Germany, for instance, the gap between the two hatreds was minute, and existed only in Enlightened and Masonic circles before the French Revolution. JudenhafJ revived, and the seeds of anti-Semitism grew rapidly, in the early 19th century with the return to Christianity and the terror of the
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 339
revolutionary consequences ofthe Enlightenment; the latterwas closely related, in the minds ofreactionaries, to Jewish rationalism. Changes taking place among the most cultivated ofthe elite the tip of the iceberg for the German ruling classes as a whole. Thus Wilhelm von Humboldt and his wife Caroline moved in Jewish circles before the Revolution, but by the end of her life Caroline's vehemence against Jews gained her recognition by the Nazis as a pioneer antiSemite. Humboldt himself still advocated giving the Jews civil rights, but he wrote in 1815: 'I like the Jews en masse; en detail, 1very carefully avoid them.'! There is also no doubt, however, that the situation became far more acute in the 1870S and 80S, and many distinguished liberals like Wilamowitz-Moellendorf and Mommsen, and others like Nietzsche, vehemently opposed the .new intensification of antisemitism. In France - with many fewerJews - the double links between Jewish rationalism and the Enlightenment, and the Revolution's having given civil rights to Jews, have firmly associated Jews with the Republican strand of French politics ever since. It has also meant that Jews have been more violently hated by Royalists and Catholics in France than anywhere else in Europe. On the other hand, while liberals and 'progressives' often shared the new racism and anti-Semitism, they did at times see Jews as the outer bulwark of the Republic; thus Jews had important allies in French society, and frequently in French government. In England, from which Jews had been expelled until the 1650s, there were theoretically philo-Semitic tendencies as well as the antiSemitic ones. There was a medieval tradition of the English as having descended from Noah's son Shem - the ancestor of the Jews - rather than from Japhet, forefather of the Europeans. There was also the Puritan vision of England as the new Jerusalem, which survives today in Blake's moving hymn.2 These traditions - and the important role played by Jews in establishing Britain's financial and colonial supremacy in the late 17th and 18th centuries - meant that here, as in France, the transformation fromJudenhaB to anti-Semitism was slow, and opened an extraordinary 'window of opportunity' in the middle of the 19th century. Converts like Disraeli could reach the highest office



340 BLACK ATHENA
in a way that was impossible both before and after, and practisingJews gained civil rights and a social acceptability which did not return until the 1950S or 60S.
WHAT RACE WERE THE SEMITES?
Although we have seen how the name 'Caucasian' was related through Prometheus to Japhetic, as opposed to Semitic, its inventor J. F. Blumenbach introduced the term only in the third edition of his great De Generis Humani Varietate Nativa, in 1795. We know that his first conception of the superior White Race included both Arabs and Jews, and this was the sense in which many English writers took the word Caucasian until the end ofthe 19th century.3 In the 1840S, for instance, Disraeli described Moses as 'in every respect a man of complete Caucasian model', while he wrote that the European Jews could not have borne all their suffering ifthey had not been'ofthe unmixed blood of the Caucasus'; later, in the 1870s, George Eliot referred toJews as 'purer Caucasians,.4 Even in Germany the violently anti-Semitic
Christian Lassen, a pupil of the Schlegels, did not refuse the Jews Caucasian status.5 In the same decades, however, new attitudes were developing. Professor Robert Knox, the anatomist, became infamous as the employer of the grave-robbers Burke and Hare. It is alleged that he asked for fresh corpses, complaining that the bodies they brought him for dissection were too old and scrawny. In any event, he was happy to accept the victims of their murders. Burke and Hare were hanged but Knox, though banned from anatomy, went on to become a pioneer pampleteer of racism. Paraphrasing the wise Sidonia in Disraeli's Tancred, who had said: 'all is race, there is no other truth', Knox maintained in 1850 that 'the race is everything, is simply a fact, the most remarkable, the most comprehensive, which philosophy has ever announced. Race is everything: literature, science, art - in a word, civilization depends on it.,6 Knox gloried in the opportunities for white men to commit genocide: 'What a field of extermination lies before the Saxon Celtic and
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 34 1
Sarmatian [Slav] races!,7 He described 'the Jew' as a 'sterile hybrid', accusing the people of having always been uncreative parasites:
But where are the Jewish farmers, Jewish mechanics [and] labourers? Why does he dislike handicraft labour? Has he no inventive power, no mechanical or scientific tum of mind? ... And then I began to enquire into this and I saw ... that the Jews who followed any calling were not really Hebrews, but sprung from a Jewish father and a Saxon or Celtic mother: that the real Jew had never altered since the earliest recorded period; ... that the real Jew has no ear for music, no love ofscience or literature, pursues no enquiry, etc....8
Knox had clearly passed from religious hatred of the Jews to modern racial anti-Semitism. Although - as the modem historian of antiSemitism Poliakov has pointed out - such racial arguments were novel in Great Britain, advanced thinkers like Darwin and Herbert Spencer (the creator ofSocial Darwinism) were working along very similar lines, and the former quoted Knox with approval.9 Let us return to France. In 1856 the great Semitist Ernest Renan complained that 'France believes very little in race, precisely because race has almost disappeared from her breast ... all this [concern with race] can only be born in a people like the Germans, who still keep to their primordial roots.,l0 The comparison between France and Germany may be just, but the French, too, were concerned with race. By the 1850s, the idea of a 'Semitic race' had long been incorporated into the new racism of France. I have already mentioned the linguistically based theory ofhistory as a dialogue between Aryans and Semites; Niebuhr's French disciple Michelet, on the other hand, saw this as a racial struggle to the death. As early as 1830 he wrote in his Roman History:
It is not without reason that the memory ofthe Punic Wars has stayed so popular and so alive. The struggle was not merely to decide the fate of two cities or two empires; it was to settle which of the two races, the Indo-Germanic or the Semitic, was to rule the world ... On the one side the genius ofheroism, ofart and oflaw; on the other



342 BLACK ATHENA
the spirit of industry, navigation and commerce ... The heroes fought - without ceasing - their industrious and perfidious neighbours. They were workers, smiths, miners, magicians. They loved gold, hanging gardens and magic palaces . .. They constructed towers with titanic ambition, which the swords of the warriors broke up and effaced from the earth.I I
This passage must be seen at two levels, both of which were to become very important. First, there was the surface level of the racial struggle between Aryans and Semites. Secondly, at another level, the words 'perfidious neighbours' point to 'perfidious Albion', the French name for England. There is no doubt that when writing about the Punic Wars, Michelet was thinking about the Napoleonic Wars of his own day. Thus, although heroic France had been beaten by the English Industrial Revolution, the parallel with the Punic Wars gave the promise of revenge. This analogy reflected the perception of a close relationship between England and the Semites in general - and the Phoenicians in particular - which to some extent explains the positive
English images ofJews just mentioned, and to which we shall frequently return.
We shall see Michelet's ideas on the Phoenicians in Gobineau and Flaubert. For the moment, however, we shall continue to look at the development ofracist anti-Semitism in France, the clearest example of which comes in the work ofEmile Louis Burnouf. Emile Bumoufwas a distinguished Hellenist, - he was director of the French School at Athens - a Sanskritist, and an enthusiast for Indo-European connections. He was also the cousin ofEugene Bumouf, one ofthe founders of Indian studies in France and the hero of Schwab's The Oriental
Renaissance. Emile Burnouf, writing in the I860s, described the Semitic race as follows:
A real Semite has smooth hair with curly ends, a strongly hooked nose, fleshy lips, extremities, thin calves, and flat feet. And what IS more, he belongs to the occipetal races: that is to say, those whose hinder part of the head is more developed than the front. His growth is very rapid, and at fifteen or sixteen it is over. At that age the divisions of the skull which contain the organs of
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 343
intelligence are already joined, and in some cases even welded together. From that period the growth ofthe brain is arrested. In the Aryan races this phenomenon, or anything like it, never occurs, at any time oflife .. }2
According to Bumouf, the Semitic race was a mixture of the white and the yellow races. His contemporary Gobineau, the ferocious reactionary later acknowledged as the father of European racism, had an even more complicated view ofJews and Semites. The Comte de Gobineau was tom between his conservative support for the Church and his excitement at the new theory of racism. This conflict led to all kinds of difficulties, the most fundamental ofwhich centred on the question ofa single or multiple creation ofman. Poliakov rightly describes him as 'a monogenist in theory and a polygenist in practice', for Gobineau did see the three races - white, yellow and black - as separate species.13 Personally tom between a rigid noble father and an 'adventuress' mother, Gobineau was explicit in his sexual imagery ofrace. 14 According to him, the 'Whites' were essentially 'male' while the 'Blacks', on the other hand, were 'female'. Despite his disgust for them, he saw 'the black element ... [as] . . . indispensable for developing artistic genius in a race, for we have seen what outbursts of ... vivacity and spontaneity are intrinsic to its soul and how much the imagination, that mirror of sensuality, and all cravings for material things, prepare it ...,15 The same tension was reflected in Gobineau's overall historical view, a hybrid of the Bible and the new Indo-Europeanism. According to him, the three races represented by the sons ofNoah - Ham, Shem, and J aphet - had all originated in Sogdiana, or some such region in Central Asia, and, rather like the Three Little Pigs, they had all set out to seek their fortunes. 16 The first to head south were the Hamites. After founding some civilizations and attempting to keep their blood pure, the Hamites had become hopelessly mongrelized by the native and inferior Blacks.17 The next to leave were the Semites. Though these too had made attempts to preserve their purity of line, they were heavily polluted with black blood; this was partly from direct contact with the Blacks, but more from that with the 'mulatto' Hamites.18 Only the J aphetites, or Aryans, had stayed in the north and retained their purity.



344 BLACK ATHENA
Although Gobineau's whole work was a lament for a lost purity, the mixture was essential to his scheme. Only if a race were mixed could one explain both its good and its bad features. Thus Gobineau attributed what he liked about the Jews - their prowess in fighting and their good cultivation of land - to their Semitic blood, but their skill in trading, their love of luxuries, cruelties, use of mercenaries and so on were due to Hamitic influence.19 In 1856 Gobineau's patron Alexis de Tocqueville wrote to console him about the slow response to his great work in France. Like their mutual friend Ernest Renan, de Tocqueville thought that the book would have a better reception in Germany, with its 'enthusiasm for abstract truth ...', and he reassured his protege that the work would 'return to France, above all by way of Germany'.20 The book was, in fact, immediately reprinted after the German conquest of France in
1940 .
) THE LINGUISTIC AND
GEOGRAPHICAL INFERIORITIES
OF THE SEMITES
Jews and Phoenicians had long, and rightly, been seen as closely related. Well before the decipherment of the Phoenician alphabet by Barthelemy in the middle of the 18th century, scholars like Samuel Bochart in the 17th had been fully aware that Hebrew and Phoenician were dialects of the same language.21 By the 1780S the two had been subsumed with Arabic, Aramaic and Ethiopic under the title 'Semitic'. Many early-19th-century scholars, reacting against the biblical picture ofHebrew as the language ofAdam and the speech ofall mankind until the fall of the Tower of Babel, fiercely denied that it was perfect or original. Hebrew was now felt to be primitive. Humboldt, for instance, urged that it be taught in the gymnasia just for that reason.22 We saw in Chapter V how Friedrich Schlegel defined the Semitic languages as the highest form of 'animal' language, but since inflection was considered to be the touchstone of the superior 'spiritual' languages, there was no way of avoiding the fact that the Semitic languages were the inflected languages par excellence.23 Thus, as Humboldt and others
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 345
created more or less 'progressive' linguistic hierarchies, Semitic had to be put on the same top rung as Indo-European. This situation, which reflected the relative toleration ofJews in earlY-19th-century Europe, was used as a basis for the academic view of 'true' history as a dialogue
between Aryans and Semites. Physiological racists perceived the Semites as both 'female' and 'sterile' - superficially intelligent and imaginative, but fundamentally incapable ofcreative thought or action. Ernest Renan, disagreeing with his friend Gobineau, followed the older strand of the Romantic tradition, which maintained that there were essentially linguistic reasons for the incapacities ofparticular peoples. Generally acknowledged to be the leading French expert in Semitic languages, and the 19th-century founder of Phoenician studies, Renan was greatly concerned with what he saw as the inadequacies of Semitic. Expressing himself with the long-windedness of the German scholars he so much admired, he wrote:
The unity and simplicity of the Semitic race is found in the Semitic languages themselves. Abstraction is unknown to them, metaphysics impossible. Language being the mould necessary for the intellectual operations of a people, an idiom almost denuded of syntax, lacking any varieties of construction, without the conjunctions which establish such delicate relations between the elements of thought, painting all objects with their exterior qualities, it ought to be eminently suitable for the eloquent inspirations of seers and the painting of fugitive impressions, but it ought to refuse all philosophy and all purely intellectual speculation. Imagine an Aristotle or a Kant with a similar instrument ...24
The other reason for the Semitic inferiority was, for Renan, geographical. Europeans, living in a rainfall climate (he was a Breton), had been given a subtle and multiform nature. Semites, coming from the desert with its pitiless sun and sharp distinctions between light and shade, had been made simple and fanatical:
The Semitic race appears to us as incomplete through its simplicity. It is, dare I say it, to the Indo-European family what drawing is to



BLACK ATHENA
painting or plainsong to modem music. It lacks that variety, that scale, that superabundance of life that is necessary for perfectibility.25
On the other hand, this simplicity and intensity had been the sources
ofreligion, which the Semites had given to the world; and Renan saw it as his mission to bring science, which was Aryan, to religion, which was
Semitic.26 Hence his philological and racial studies of the origins of Christianity. Religion, however, should not be thought of as giving the Semites equality:
Thus the Semitic race is to be recognized almost entirely by negative characteristics. It has neither mythology, nor epic, nor science, nor philosophy, nor fiction, nor plastic arts, nor civil life; in everything there is a complete absence ofcomplexity, subdety or feeling, except for unity. It has no variety in its monotheism.27
Rena!ys attitude is crucial, not only because his extraordinary public recognition indicates that he was articulating commonly held views but also because of his dominant position in Semitic, biblical and Phoenician studies. The combination meant that he both reflected and focused popular opinion and scholarly attitudes in these disciplines.28 Indeed, there are striking parallels between Renan's relations with the Semitic languages and those of Humboldt, Niebuhr and Bunsen in their promotion ofEgyptology. In both cases the scholars appear to have feared the charge of having too much sympathy with the object of their study. Any implication oftreachery to Europe was ofcourse unjustified, as the very act of,scientific' study ofa non-European culture made that culture qualitatively inferior, exotic and inert.29 Renan, however, insisted that the Semites were not like the other non-Indo-Europeans, about whom there was nothing good to be said. The Semites had good qualities which, he maintained, they shared with the English; and his hostility to both, unlike tIlat of Michelet, was tempered. According to him, both peoples possessed 'a great uprightness of
mind and an enviable simplicity of heart, an exquisite sentiment of morality ...,30
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 347
THE ARNOLDS
The contrasts between Thomas and Matthew Arnold provide an instructive example of the changes that were taking place in English racism in the 19th century. Dr Thomas Arnold was preoccupied in the 1820S and 30S with the conflicts between Teuton and Gael- including Gallo-Roman - and notably those between the English and the French and Irish. He was proud to be known as 'that Teuton of Teutons, the Celt-hating Dr Arnold,.31 His son Matthew in the 1850s, 60S and 70S favoured both the Irish and the French, believing that he had transcended his father's narrow-mindedness.32 Fully aware ofthe new linguistic advances, he was a systematic supporter of Indo-Europeans and Aryans. He loved them all. Indeed, leading another school of mid-19th-century English thought, he was even enthusiastic about the Gypsies or Bohemians. These Indo-European speakers were now seen, rather like Winckelmann's Greeks, as gay, charming, feckless, childish - yet somehow philosophical - Aryan cousins. They were the lighter side of Indo-European culture.33
Matthew Arnold recognized that Renan, after his own father, was the greatest intellectual influence on his life.34 He had accepted Renan's belief - shared by most advanced thinkers of the time - that the fundamental divide in world history was between Hellene and Hebrew, between Aryan and Semite.35 However, he was faced with a problem which did not affect the continental racists: he was forced to recognize the validity of their charge that the English shared qualities with the Semites. Furthermore, as I have mentioned, Britain had a philoSemitic tradition which became particularly strong with the rise of the bourgeoisie in the mid-19th century. Thus many Victorians saw themselves as biblical patriarchs, priding themselves on their diligence, thrift, discretion, respect for forms and - above all- their sense ofrigid righteousness. Arnold was tormented by this affinity, which cut across linguistic and racial lines. His explanation for the anomaly was that the English 'Hebraic' spirit was chiefly the result of the Reformation and of Puritanism. That is, the division between Hellene and Hebrew was that of the Civil War, the continuing struggle between High and Low

Church, Church and Chapel, and between the industrialized north and the agricultural south.36 Like Renan, Matthew Arnold claimed to recognize many virtues in the 'Hebraic' tradition; nevertheless, he called upon England to turn away from the bourgeois philistinism ofthe latter-day Puritans and look towards the Greeks. The Greeks following the major tradition, that of Winckelmann - he saw as spontaneous, light, artistic and serene. But - as a man of the 19th century - Arnold also added clear thinking and a unique capacity for philosophy. By turning towards the Hellenic spirit, England could join the progress of her European neighbours. Arnold's ultimate appeal, made in his famous Culture and Anarchy, was to race: 'Hellenism is of Indo-European growth. Hebraism is of Semitic growth, and we English, a nation of Indo-European stock, seem to belong naturally to the movement of Hellenism.,37 Although Victorian Hellenism was a vital and complex movement with many facets, there is no doubt that all images of Greece after Matthew Arnold published Culture andAnarchy in 1869 were developed "in relation or reaction to his restatement of German Neo-Hellenism. Where Dr Arnold's love of Greece meshed with his Protestantism, Teutonism and anti-Semitism, his son's Hellenism was explicitly linked to the vision of the Indo-European or Aryan race in a perpetual struggle with the Semitic one, or to the conflict between 'cultivated' and bourgeois values. And in this, ofcourse, he was following a well-beaten path. In theory - like Michelet, Renan and others - he accepted, as Bunsen put it, that 'If the Hebrew Semites are the priests ofhumanity, the Helleno-Roman Aryans are, and ever will be, its heroes.,38 All, however, dearly felt that in granting the Semites religion they were granting them too much. As Matthew Arnold noted in a letter to his mother:
Bunsen used to say that our great business was to get rid of all that was purely Semitic in Christianity and to make it Indo-Germanic, and Schleiermacher that in Christianity of us Western nations there was really much more ofPlato and Sokrates than ofjoshua and David; and on the whole Papa worked in the direction ofthese ideas of Bunsen and Schleiermacher and was perhaps the only powerful Englishman of his day who did so.39
I'
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 349
Without wishing to detract from Dr Arnold's pioneering spirit on this issue, it will be remembered that in 1825 Thirlwall had translated Schleiermacher's St Luke, which contained many of these ideas. What is more, in France Victor Cousin had been proclaiming the Hellenic nature of Christianity as early as 1818.40 While one cannot always blame fathers for the sins oftheir sons, it is interesting to note that during the 1870S Bunsen's son Ernst invented a form of Aryan sun worship, based on biblical tradition, in which Adam was Aryan and the serpent Semitic!41 By the end of the century there had been a number of different attempts to found an Aryan or Germanic Christianity. The most successful ofthese was created by the fringe academic Semitist and passionate German nationalist Paul Lagarde. Lagarde argued that Jesus had been an 'Aryan Jew' from Galilee who had been crucified by the 'Semitic Jews' of Judaea. To make matters worse, Christianity had been taken over and perverted by another Jew, Paul, and there was thus a need to strip the true Aryan religion of its Semitic excrescences. Lagarde was a passionate antiSemite who called repeatedly for the destruction ofJudaism and the exile of the Jews in Madagascar, which later became one of Hitler's schemes. Lagarde's movement in general has been convincingly described as one ofthe sources ofNazism.42 In England, things were never so crude. Even so, towards the end of the century there was a desire to strip the Semites of their one contribution to humanity. One ofthe chiefthemes ofHardy's Tess ofthe d'Urbervilles, first published in 1891, is the conflict between the true, ever-vital Saxon England in its heartland ofWessex, and the decadent French descendants ofthe conquerors. However, Hardy's Germanism was also linked to Hellenism, which he saw as battling with the Semitism and the philistinism ofthe new bourgeoisie. The hero, Angel Clare, wants to return to the land and wed a pure Saxon maid. At the same time, he has the Dionysian qualities of one of Winckelmann's Greeks: he likes dancing, eating and drinking and generally frolicking in the blissful countryside. Angel's father and brothers are archetypal Semites: moral, upright, and completely out of touch with nature and life. Hardy describes the crucial moment of their conflict in these terms:



350 BLACK ATHENA
Once upon a time Angel had been so unlucky as to say to his father ... that it might have been better for mankind ifGreece had been the source of religion for modem civilization and not Palestine, and his father's grief was of that blank description which could not realize that there might work a thousandth part of truth, much less a half truth or a whole truth, in such a proposition.43
Here, then, though he did not share their love of the Gaels, Hardy aligned himselfwith Matthew Arnold and Renan.
PHOENICIANS AND ENGLISH, I:
THE ENGLISH VIEW
Despite the association between the English and the Semites, no one compared the English to the Arabs or the Ethiopians. The 'Semites' they had in mind were Jews and/or Phoenicians, and in this part of the chapter we will concentrate on the identification with the Phoenicians. While Michelet's discussion of the perpetual war between the IndoEuropeans and Semites focused on the conflict between Rome and Carthage, the parallels between Carthage and England were very clear for 19th-century readers on both sides ofthe Channel. Many Victorians had a positive feeling towards the Phoenicians as sober cloth merchants who did a little bit of slaving on the side and spread civilization while making a tidy profit. Thus William Gladstone, who came from very much this kind of mercantile background, was an ardent champion of the Phoenicians.44 This may seem surprising in view of his passion for Homer's aristocratic values, his love for European Greece, and his hatred for Asiatic Turkey.45 Such enthusiasms, however, were quite compatible in the 1840S, when Gladstone's future rival, Disraeli, was proclaiming the superiority ofthr Semitic race. And as late as 1889, the respected historian G. Rawlinson produced a very favourable history of Phoenicia in which he described the Phoenicians as 'the people who of all Antiquity had the most in common with England and the English.,46 There was also a widespread - and quite reasonable - beliefthat the Phoenicians had come to Cornwall to trade for tin, and Matthew Arnold seems to have seen this as an early source of English Hebraism. In his
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 35 1
famous poem beginning 'Some grave Tyrian trader ...', the Phoenician slips shyly away from the new Greek master race, 'the young lighthearted masters ofthe wave'. The Phoenician is then driven out of the Mediterranean to the Atlantic and Britain, and the same sympathy for the doomed Phoenician appears over fifty years later in 'Death By
Water' in T. S. Eliot's The WasteLand:
Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, Forgot the cry of gulls and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss. A current under sea Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell He passed the stages ofhis age and youth
Entering the whirlpool. Gentile orJ ew o you who tum the wheel and look to windward, Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.47
The Waste Landbelongs to the 'post-Berard' era, which 1shall discuss in the next chapter. Nevertheless, it is indicative of longer-term AngloSaxon attitudes as well, in its relating Phoenicians to their own activities on the sea and in banking. Its ambiguity on the Phoenicians' Semitic nature is also telling, for if Semites were the epitome ofparasitism and passivity, then the Phoenicians - who were active in sailing, manufacture and trade rather than the Jewish 'financing' - could not have
been truly Semitic. In extreme old age, Gladstone felt the need to defend his beloved Phoenicians from the now crippling charge of being Semitic: 'I have always believed that the Phoenicians were at bottom a non-Semitic stock.,48 Indeed, by the beginning of the 20th century Britain was quickly catching up with the rest of Europe in its anti-Semitism, and attitudes to the Phoenicians became even more complicated. Beliefthat Britain could have a special connection with even marginal Semites became increasingly suspect. So to look for it, as Sherlock Holmes intended to do during his retirement in Cornwall, was now considered the epitome of crankiness. On the other hand, even the attribution of crankiness implies a certain fondness for the notion and for the



35 2 BLACK ATHENA
Phoenicians; very different attitudes towards them had developed elsewhere in Europe.
PHOENICIANS AND ENGLISH, 2:
THE FRENCH VIEW
Michelet's implicit - and ultimately comforting - analogy between the French and the Romans, and the English and the Carthaginians, has been mentioned above. Elsewhere, however, he was explicit:
Human pride personified in a people, that is England. What happens when the barbarians (Normans and Danes) are transplanted to this powerful island, where they become fat on the richness of the land and the tribute of the ocean? Kings of the sea, of the world without law and without limit, uniting the savage hardness of the Danish pirate and the feudal arrogance ofthe 'Lord' son ofthe Normans ... How many Tyres and Carthages would one have to pile up to reach the insolence oftitanic England?49
The ferocity behind this analogy can be seen from his references to the Phoenicians: 'The Carthaginians, like the Phoenicians from which they came, appear to have been a people who were hard and sad, sensual and greedy, and adventurous without heroism.' After this splendid example ofhaving it both ways, he continued with the view that 'at Carthage too the religion was atrocious and full of frightful practices.,50
The damning parallels between the English and the Phoenicians in general, and the Carthaginians in particular, remained a strand in French thinking throughout the 19th century. This contrast can be seen from the fact that when Gladstone said that the Phoenicians were not Semites, he meant that they were better than Jews. For most French
and German writers, on the other hand, they were much worse, and
J
here it would be useful to consider Gobineau's attitudes towards the Phoenicians. Gobineau is important for two reasons: he had a considerable influence on French and German thought as well as on Matthew Arnold, and he seems to have expressed, in extreme form, many views
that friends ofhis like de Tocqueville and Renan held, but did not dare publish.
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 353
The position of the Phoenicians in Gobineau's scheme of the three invasions of the Hamites, Semites and J aphetites, or Aryans, was complicated. The Bible clearly placed them as descendants ofHam but, as we saw in Chapter III, scholars have known about the extremely close relationships between Phoenician and Hebrew at least since the 17th
century.51 For Gobineau in the 19th century, this was both crucial and distressing. The powerful combmatIon ofbIbhcal tradition, his reluctance to have the holy language too closely to that of the Phoenicians, and his mixed - but in many ways pOSItIve attitude towards the Jews impelled him to portray the Phoenicians as Hamites and not as Semites. Thus the only way for Gobineau to reconcile the biblical and linguistic sources was through outright falsehood. In 1815, the great German Semitist Wilhelm Gesenius had divided the Semitic languages into three subfamilies: (I) Aramaic and Syriac; (2) Canaanite, including Hebrew and Phoenician, from which came Punic; and (3) Arabic, from which he derived Ethiopic.52 At another point, however, Gesenius had mentioned that Phoenician had been spread to the widespread Phoenician colonies and markets, and Gobineau cited this page to claim that Gesenius had classified the Semitic languages into four categories:
The first contains Phoenician, Punic and Libyan, from which the Berber dialects are derived; the second Hebrew and its variations; the third ... Aramaic ... the fourth, Arabic ...53
Apart from the separation of Phoenician and Hebrew, the linguistic outrage in this classification is Gobineau's association of Phoenician with the Berber languages. No Semitist, then or now, would accept these as Semitic. However, both violations were essential to his scheme in order to define the Phoenicians as Hamitic, according to the biblical pattern. That is, their initial 'white' nature had allowed them to establish a certain degree of civilization, but by the time the Semites arrived from the north-east the Phoenicians had become virtually 'black' and were therefore responsible for the corruption of the Jews:
'At the time of Abraham, Hamite civilization was in a full bloom in its ..c.. d · · · ,54
peuectIon an m Its VIces. Gobineau spent much more time on the vices than on the perfection.



354 BLACK ATHENA
Near the beginning ofthe whole work, and using the images ofrats and disease that the Nazis applied to the Jews, he asked the rhetorical question: 'Did the Phoenicians owe their downfall to the corruption that gnawed at them and which they spread everywhere? No, quite the contrary, their corruption was the chief instrument of their power and their glory.'sS To what extent, then, did Gobineau have England in mind when he wrote this? Gobineau knew English well and frequently cited English sources, and he dedicated his Essay on the Inequality of Human Races to the English-born king of Hanover. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that in all his travels around the world, from Scandinavia to Persia, Brazil and many other places, he never went across the Channel to England. Furthermore, Gobineau is strangely silent about the country that dominated the world ofhis time - and here there is a striking contrast with his bubbling enthusiasm for Germany. Following his patron de Tocqueville, Gobineau obviously approved of the Anglo-Saxon sense of categorical superiority over the native Americans and Blacks in North America; he was equally scathing about the hypocrisy surrounding slavery.56 He was much more concerned with and appalled by American immigration policies, and in this connection he compared New York unfavourably to Carthage, which had at least been settled by noble Canaanite families. Furthermore: 'Carthage gained everything that Tyre and Sidon lost. But Carthage has not added a jot to Semitic civilization, nor did it prevent its eventual fate.,s7 Elsewhere Gobineau compared the mercantile functions of Tyre and Sidon to London and Hamburg, and the manufacturing ones to Liverpool and Birmingham.58 The analogy between the AngloSaxons and the Canaanites, and his dislike of both, would seem clear. Nevertheless, it is obvious that he detested the Hamites and the impure Semites in their own right. He saw the later Phoenicians as the result of
a mixture of 'mulatto' Hamites and Semites, in which of course
)
the latter, being more 'white', were superior. Yet, with the tragic irony which he found throughout history, the 'black' and inferior 'female' races conquered and corrupted the 'white', 'male' ones. Thus the Phoenicians created cities in which incredible luxury and splendour were mixed with barbarous customs; and above all there were the hideous religious rites, including prostitution and human
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 355
sacrifice, which, he assured his readers, 'the white race has never
practised'.59 • In their government, the Phoenicians were not and like the
'Whites', but ruled either by despots or by democratic mobs. 'Yorst of all was Carthage - without a history and founded after the Hanutes had completely degenerated, and then exposed to still more African influence.61 Gobineau saw the arrival of the Semites as a great step forward, but they too were seduced by 'black' culture, and in general he was tom in his attitudes towards theJews. At times he argued that they had preserved some of their white nature; at others he.maintained. that the Hebrews changed from martial herdsmen mto effennnate merchants.62 But worst of all, they hired other peoples as mercenaries.
About this practice Gobineau wrote:
One of the principal characteristics of the degradation of the Hamites and the most apparent cause oftheir fall ... was their loss of warrior courage and the practice of no longer taking part in military activities. This scandal, profound in Babylon and Nineveh, was
hardly less in Tyre and Sidon ...63
SALAMMB6
Michelet gave the same message in 1830, when describing the revolt of the Carthaginian mercenaries after their defeat in the First Punic War in 241 BC. Basing himself on Classical sources - mainly the Greek historian Polybios - Michelet gave a vivid report of this mutiny of an army that was extraordinarily mixed ethnically and was led by a Black, Matho, and a Greek, Spendios. It was defeated after campaigns of extraordinary violence and cruelty in which both the mercenaries and a number oftheir Carthaginian opponents were put to death in scenes of
exceptional horror.64 Michelet's text became the basis for Gustave Flaubert's novel Salammba. Flaubert had long been fascinated by the exoticism of the 'Orient'. He had been to Egypt, and after the success ofMadame Buvary
he had wanted to write a novel about that country called Anubis.65 At some point before March 1857, however, he changed his mind and



BLACK ATHENA
decided to use the plot that eventually became Salammbo. The Italian scholar Benedetto suggested that he dropped Anubis because Theophile Gautier brought out a novel on Ancient Egypt in the same year. But neither he nor other 'Flaubertians' have been able to determine what caused Flaubert to choose his new topic.66 Despite the fact that it does not appear in his correspondence, the answer would seem to be the 'Indian Mutiny' which broke out in February that year. Britain - the great empire of the modem Phoenicians - had succeeded, through its greed and brutality and by its use of beefand pork fat on cartridges which had to be licked by the soldiers, in the difficult task ofuniting its Hindu and Moslem mercenaries in revolt against it. Even at its outbreak it became clear that the 'Mutiny' was being fought on both sides with exceptional ferocity and cruelty. Thus the parallel between England and Carthage was in Salammbo from its inception.
In May 1861, when Flaubert felt that his book was ready for his friends, he invited the famous Parisian literary figures the Goncourt brothers to come to a reading with the following programme:
1\ I begin to shout at 4 o'clock punctually, sometimes about 3 o'clock.
2 At 7 o'clock, Eastern dinner. You'll be served human flesh, bourgeois brains, tigress's clitoris fried in rhinoceros butter. 3. After the coffee, a resumption ofthe Punic bawling until after the listeners croak.67
Baudelaire, the poet of decadence, was a particular friend while Flaubert was writing the novel, and Salammbo is a study in decadence.68 From the viewpoint of the French upper class in the 1850s, Flaubert had chosen the most decadent aspect (mercenaries) of the most decadent city and of the most decadent people (the Phoenicians). Or, to put it another way, he pictured the accumulation of all the opposites ofdecent masculine white society: the ethnic potpourri of mercenaries led by a Black on the one hand and a Greek who was a traitor to his race on the other; against the Carthaginians, who were themselves seen as a hideous mixture of Negroes, Hamites and Semites; with a luxurious subtropical background containing priests,
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 357
eunuchs and sensuous, corrupting women; all locked in cruel and
frightful conflict. There was, as I have said, genuine historical material with which to build up such a case. Flaubert reinforced his reading of Michelet and Polybios with a trip to the site of Carthage; but also, and much more importantly, he used material from the latest French Orientalist scholarship, notably that of Renan. Following this, he became fully aware of the close cultural relations between all Canaanite speakers, and used biblical information about the Israelites and their neighbours to eke out the meagre material available about the Phoenicians and
Carthaginians.69 Benedetto, writing in 1920, showed that Flaubert's reconstruction had stood the test oflater scholarship quite well.7o Despite the fact that Benedetto was associated with the exceptionally anti-Semitic School of Classics in Rome and was writing at a period of intense racialism and general anti-Semitism, much of what the Italian claimed would still seem true today.71 Where I do think Flaubert was fundamentally misleading, however, was in two of his implications. One was that Carthage in the 3rd century BC was in some way typical of Oriental culture; hence not only did it deserve the genocide it received from the Romans ninety years later, but there was little moral objection to the colonial destructions ofnon-European civilizations in the 19th century. (Here, moreover, we have another reason why Flaubert dropped his scheme of writing on Ancient Egypt, which was far too lacking in vice and cruelty for his purposes.) Secondly, Flaubert implied that Europeans - with the possible exception of the English - were incapable of such things. In fact, the Romans outdid the Carthaginians in virtually every luxury and outrage, while the Macedonians were not far behind. And in specifics, the Carthaginian Mercenary War in the 3rd century BC, with its social revolutionary component, was comparable to the Roman War -less than 200 years later - against the armies of slaves led by Spartacus, which were fought and exterminated with equal horror.72 Flaubert's own society, the France of the Second Empire, was inflicting incredible outrages on the populations of China and Indo-China and, even more to the point, on those of Algeria. In some ways, furthermore, the



BLACK ATHENA
exploitation, luxury and corruption of SalammbO's Carthage were very similar to the same features in Flaubert's Paris, as described so vividly in the novels ofEmile Zola.73
Salammh6 was an immense success. When Flaubert had tried to portray French bourgeois life realistically in Madame Bovary, his book had been mutilated by the publisher and he was put on trial for 'outraging public morals'. SalammbO was far more scabrous in every respect, but this time it made Flaubert the lion of Parisian high society and enabled him to become a friend of the Imperial family.74 Flaubert had hit a literary jackpot; his 'realism' applied to the 'Orient' allowed readers to get their sexual and sadistic thrills, while maintaining their sense of innate and categorical superiority as white Christians. It also increased the urgency ofFrance's mission civilisatrice to save the peoples of other continents from their own cruelty and wickedness.75
MOLOCH
Flaubert made much of one horrific aspect of Carthaginian culture sharedl)y neither the Romans nor the 19th-century Europeans. It was the special sacrifice of children either through cutting the throat, or burning, or both. Following the exegetical tradition of the time, he referred to it as a sacrifice to the terrible god Moloch. It has since been established that the root Ymlk in this case refers not to a divinity but to the name ofthe sacrifice itself.76 In Carthage the victims were meant to be the sons of the ruling families but Flaubert, following Classical sources, recounted that some ofthe rich obtained substitutes from the children of the poor or of slaves.77 Here, though he added gruesome details of his own, he was following Greek and Roman historians; and here too the later excavation, at Carthage and many of its colonies, of hundreds -of urns full of burnt children's bones and dedicated to the God Bacal would seem to confirm his reconstruction.78 There is no doubt that in both the Jewish and Christian traditions, this child sacrifice was felt to be the ultimate abomination. The huge success ofSalammhO, in France and in the rest ofEurope - which partly resulted from its depiction of Moloch - reopened the biblical horror with extraordinary force. For many this feeling extended to a complete
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS 359
condemnation of the society that practised it, and provided powerful ammunition for all those who hated Carthage and the Phoenicians with
theirJewish and English associations. Furthermore, there is no doubt that such feelings extended into academia. Nearly all 20th-century historians of Carthage and Phoeni
cia have had to take Flaubert into account.79 On the Jewish side, SalammbO and its emphasis on Moloch would seem to have revived and intensified the biblical and religious hatred ofthe Canaanites and their abominations, and to have led even non-religious and assimilated Jews to keep their distance from the Canaanites and Phoenicians. In 1870, the chief enemy of Carthage and England changed. France went into the Franco-Prussian War as an empire and emerged as a republic, while the King of Prussia came out of it as the Emperor of Germany. Many Germans now believed that the mande of the Holy Roman Empire and of Rome itself had fallen upon them. Even in the 18th century, Herder is reported as having said that Carthage was so flawed by its abominations that it should be compared to a jackal which
the Roman she-wolf should destroy; by the late 19th century the
deserved destruction of the city was a platitude.8o Great stress was laid upon the finality of the Roman Destruction of the city. The sentence 'Carthage, which was destroyed by the Romans, was never rebuilt' incidentally, completely untrue - appears to have been a commonplace
expression.81 This principle - of a final solution - was extended in propaganda towards England in the two World Wars, and in actuality towards the Jews in the Holocaust.82 In this, however, I am going ahead of myself into the period of intense 'racial' anti-Semitism after the 1880s, and here we should consider mid- 19th-century attitudes towards the idea
ofPhoenician setdement in Greece.
THE PHOENICIANS IN GREECE:
1820-80
K. O. Muller, who denied the Phoenician role in the formation of Greece, was probably anti-Semitic.83 As we have seen, however, his attack on Kadmos was not generally accepted at the time. In fact, with



I
I
BLACK ATHENA
the decline ofadmiration for the Egyptians there was increased interest and respect for the Phoenicians. The change was reflected in F. C. Movers' The Phoenicians, which appeared during the I 840S, whose huge volumes were based on the compilation of every Classical and biblical reference to the people. Like Julius Beloch in the 19th and Rhys Carpenter in the 20th century - whose careers we shall consider in the next chapters - Movers tended to attribute Phoenician dynamism to northern influences, and especially those from the Assyrians.84 Like many later historians he had a great admiration for this brutal culture, which is often portrayed as in some way less 'Semitic' than its purely Semitic language would suggest. In the 19th century, Assyrian military prowess was credited to 'white' influences.85 On the other hand, if the Semites lost credit to the north and east, they gained it to the south. As far as the presence of Phoenicians in Greece was concerned, not only did Movers accept all the credit given to the Phoerucians by the Ancients, but he also annexed that of the 'Egyptian' Danaos. This position can to some extent be justified by the real complexity of the mixed culture of Lower Egypt in the Hyksos period. However, as his admirer Michael Astour puts it, Movers had grasped this point by 'intuition rather than with the aid of the evidence at his disposal'.86 Jhus we should judge his conclusion historiographically - and in this way it fits the era following the fall of the Egyptians, but before that of the Phoenicians.
GOBINEAU'S IMAGE OF GREECE
This is also the period in which we should situate Gobineau's attitude to the origins of Greece. Gobineau, as we saw, was working within the Aryan Model, but in the 1850S the model was still very 'broad' and allowed for Semitic influences. He analysed the Greeks in the following way:
I. Hellenes - Aryans modified by yellow principles, but with a great preponderance ofwhite essence and some Semitic affinities. 2. Aborigines - Slav/Celts saturated with yellow elements. 3· Thracians - Aryans mixed with Celts and Slavs.
[CU. VIII) THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS
4. Phoenicians - Black Hamites. s. Arabs and Hebrews - very mixed Semites. 6. Philistines - Semites, possibly more pure.
7. Libyans - almost black Hamites.. . . . . . 87 8. Cretans and other islanders - Senutes similar to the Philistmes.
It is enough to make even the most stout-hearted racist throw his hands in despair! Gobineau, however, persisted, though he found It impossible to be consistent in such a complex situation. To say this of him is not to disparage him entirely. If one translates from 'race' to culture there is no. doubt of the reality of some of the shifting mixtures involved. Gobineau was quite right to say: 'no country presents, in primitive epochs, such ethnic convulsions, such sudden displacements and multiple immigrations.,88 Furthermore, his scheme has far greater explanatory value than the Extreme Aryan Model. He believed that the Greek Aborigines had been invaded from the north by the Aryan 'Titans' sometime in the 3rd millennium; at around the same time, however, they had been invaded from the south by Canaanites, whom he saw both as Semitic Arabs and Hebrews and as black Phoenicians.89 He followed Movers in seeing the Phoenicians as having gained their civilization from Assyria, which had white elements.90 Given the corruption of Greek blood by black Phoenicians, the issue of whether or not there had been Egyptian colonies was not very important to Gobineau. Nevertheless, he accepted the recent scholarship that had denied the existence of Egyptian colonies in Greece.91 While he followed Schlegel's theory that the greatness of Egyptian civilization had come from Indian colonization, he also believed that the racial mongrelization ofthe Egyptian population - which included considerable black and even Negroid elements - had given the country a static and passive nature.92 For Gobineau saw Greek history as a struggle between the Aryan Greek spirit based to the north of Thebes, and the Semitic spirit of the south, both being reinforced by their racial cousins from outside the country.93 In this way he had no problem with the traditions of Kadmos and Danaos or with the excellence of the Dorians.94 It must be noted, however, that despite his enthusiasm for the



BLACK ATHENA
character and institutions of the Aryan Hellenes, Gobineau was convinced that Ancient Greece as a whole had been thoroughly 'blackened' and 'Semitized'. He was among those who maintained that the modern Greeks were so mongrelized that they could no longer be considered as descendants of the Ancients.95 Indeed, his belief in the Phoenician influence on Greece was part ofhis general beliefthat Southern Europe had been irredeemably 'Semitized' and that only the Germanic peoples ofthe north had retained their 'white' purity.96 In this, however, he was clearly in the minority. While they were coming to share his views on Aryan superiority, most Northern Europeans were not prepared to give up Greece and Rome.
All in all, there was increasing reluctance to believe in the Phoenician settlements. We have seen in the last chapter how Grote avoided the issue; how Bunsen and Curtius wriggled around the legends; and how William Smith and George Rawlinson equivocated on them.97 Others, however, though they would not go as far as Gobineau, still saw no reason to doubt the Ancient Model where it touched on the Phoenicians. As Gladstone wrote in 1869:
...)a further prosecution of the subject with respect to the Phoenicians has brought out much more clearly and fully what I had only ventured to suspect or hint at, and gives them, if I am right, a highly influential function in forming the Greek nation. The detection, ifit be a real one, of these powerful Semitic influences, both in the Greece of Homer and as they had operated before his time, opens a new perspective into the ancient history of the world.98
SCHLIEMANN AND THE DISCOVERY
OF THE 'MYCENAEANS'
Of course Gladstone was primarily a politician and not an academic; therefore his views were not completely up to date. However, it is noteworthy that his remarks came just before Heinrich Schliemann's startling discoveries at Mycenae and Tiryns in the 1870s. Schliemann himself insisted that he had 'gazed upon the face ofAgamemnon', and that the remains were those ofthe Homeric heroes, who were ofcourse
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS
Greek. Initially, however, his finds had exacdy the opposite effect. They strengthened the hands of those who maintained that there had been significant Phoenician influence in Greece. The Mycenaean finds were certainly very unlike any previous notion ofGreek art, and it was generally agreed that they were ugly. Therefore it was variously assumed that they were Byzantine, Gothic, or - most commonly of all- Oriental; and in the last case either imports or made in Greece by Eastern craftsmen or their Greek apprentices.99 The obvious conclusion, then, was that these were traces of the Phoenician colonists of the Greek tradition. As the eminent German ancient historian Max Dunker wrote in 1880:
The examination of the most ancient monuments on the soil of Greece has afforded proof of an extensive commerce of the Phoenicians on the coasts ofthe country; not only the objects found within the monuments, but the monuments themselves, spoke incontestably in favour of the influence, and therefore of the presence, of Phoenicians in Greece. There are further traces, signs, and remains of Phoenician settlements on Greek soil, and of Phoenician influence on the Greeks. The Greek tradition itselftells us ofthe city and dominion which a Phoenician king's son founded in their land. This is the only settlement ofwhich it speaks: but we are in aposition to prooe that there existed a whole series ofPhoenician colonies on the coast of ReI/as. (my emphasis)100
Other German scholars, like the historian of Greece Adolf Holm, disagreed. Holm, who avowedly saw the Greeks as an 'exceptionally high type of humanity', followed Ernst Curtius' 'most recent scientific revision of the traditionary epoch'. Writing in the I 880s, he set out his own view ofthe scholarly dilemma:
Onate a decided reaction has set in against the popular theory ofthe great influence exercised by the Phoenicians on Greece, which is perfecdy justifiable, but it is not always to the point. The real reason why people contest the existence ofPhoenicians in Greece is that they objea to make the Greeks indebted to Phoenicia for anything ofimportance. We believe we have proved that the widespread influence ascribed to



BLACK ATHENA
them . . . originates solely in caprice. But why should there be a reluctance to admit the existence ofmere settlements ofPhoenicians in Greece, when supportedby historicalcriteria which are consideredvalid in other cases? Phoenicians were once there, but their influence was inconsiderable. (my emphasis)101
Holm's words show with wonderful clarity the outside pressures on the ancient historians, and the reason for the compromise taken by scholars like Connop Thirlwall in the 1830S and Frank Stubbings in the 1960s.102 However, it was not acceptable in the high tide ofimperialism
and anti-Semitism from 1885 to 1945, which was also the period ofthe professionalization of Classical archaeology.
The tone that was to predominate throughout that period had already been set. As a writer put it in the first issue of The American Journal of A rchaeology in 1885:
The Phoenicians, so far as we know, did not bring a single fructifying idea into the world ... their arts ... hardly deserve to be called arts; they were for the most part only traders. Their architecture, sculpture, painting were of the most unimaginative sort. neir religion, so far as we know it, was entirely an appeal to the senses. 103
BABYLON
By the 1880s, however, there was a new type of less objectionable 'Semite'. Since the beginning of the century there had been considerable interest in the ancient ruins ofMesopotamia, while the sympathy of men like Movers and Gobineau for the Assyrians, who conquered and slaughtered in a very 'unSemitic' way, has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the 1840S and 50S saw the gradual decipherment of the cuneiform scripts in which Old Persian, the Assyrian and Babylonian dialects of Akkadian, atld the ancient non-Semitic language Sumerian were written. The decipherment generated great scholarly excitement, which intensified over the following decades as Akkadian texts with striking biblical parallels began to be read. 104 With the increasing
[CH. VIII] THE RISE AND FALL OF THE PHOENICIANS
secularization of the 1870S and 80S, these texts were welcomed as .providing a background fot the Old Testament. They also be used to confirm the belief that the culture of the West Senutes - the Jews and Phoenicians - was, as one would expect from Semit.es, essentially derivative, and had come from the much older Babyloruan civilization. This tendency became greater still in the 1890s, when it was established to everyone's satisfaction that Mesopotamian civilization had been created not by Semites but by the Sumerians, and that 'when the Semites appeared in Babylonia, civilization was fully developed.' 105 Scholars who, for various reasons, wanted to avoid giving credit to the Phoenicians began to attribute irreducible Semitic elements in Greek and other European cultures to the Assyrians and Babylonians.106 Even here, however, there was the problem that the normal route of transmission would be by sea, through Phoenicia - or at least North Syria. Indeed, from the late 19th century there has been a tendency to attribute Oriental influences on Greece to Anatolia, whose 'Asianic' populations were not Semitic-speaking. Ancient tradition does refer to Greek contacts with Asia Minor, and it was from there that Pelops was supposed to have conquered much of Southern Greece. According to the Ancient Model, however, this conquest was consistently placed after those ofK.admos and Danaos, and Pe10ps was not given the credit for any cultural innovations - apart from chariot-racing. After the language ofthe ancient Anatolian"empire ofthe Hittites was discovered to be related to Indo-European in 1912, it was taken up with much enthusiasm by German Orientalists. Both they and Classicists have attempted to give Anatolians as much credit as possible for 'Oriental' influence on Greece. For instance, the British Classicist and historian P. Walcot, whose important work Hesiod and the Near East was published in 1966, devotes his first chapter to the Hittites, and his second to the Babylonians; however, neither of these - in striking contrast to the Egyptians and Phoenicians - are mentioned in Antiquity 18 sources ofGreek mythology and religion. 107 Indeed, in the years with which the next chapter is concerned - 1885 to 1945 - what little ,cholarly attention there was on Oriental influences on Greece concenrated on the transmission ofBabylonian influence to Greece overland,



BLACK ATHENA
avoiding Syria and following the Gennan preference for land rather
than sea transport and communication. It is to this period that we shall now tum.

CHAPTER IX
THE FINAL SOLUTION
OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM,
1885 - 1 945
T
HIS CHAPTER IS CONCERNED with the consolidation of the Aryan Model and the denial ofboth E-gyptian and Phoenician influence on the fonnation of Greece. The denial of Phoenician influence is clearly related to the strong anti-Semitism of the period, and in particular to its two climaxes or paroxysms - in the 1880s and 90S and the 1920S and 30S. The first of these followed the mass migration ofEast EuropeanJews into Western Europe and crystallized around the Dreyfus Affair; the second came after the critical role of Jews in international Communism and the Russian Revolution and during the economic crises of the 1920S and 30S. In the 1890S in scholarship, initial salvos against traditions of Phoenician colonization were fired by an.. assimilated French Jew, Salomon Reinach, and a Gennan exile in Italy, Julius Beloch. These were followed by a lull during which the great French scholar Victor Berard had a great success in promoting his ideas of a fundamental Semitic penetration ofGreece among the lay public - but not among his Classical colleagues. In the same period, however, Arthur Evans' sensational discoveries in Crete, and his differentiation of the 'Minoans' from the Semitic speakers who had previously been thought to have been the native



BLACK ATHENA
population ofthe island, encouraged great interest in the 'Pre-Hellenic' populations of the Aegean. All aspects of Greek culture that could not be explained in terms of Indo-European were attributed to this mysterious 'Minoan' people, allowing Greece to be culturally selfsufficient and removing any need to explain developments in terms of influences from the Near East. In the 1920S this rejection of any Semitic influence in the Aegean included a strikingly successful attempt to diminish the importance of the one Phoenician borrowing that could not be denied: the alphabet. Indeed, by 1939 supporters of the Extreme Aryan Model dominated the field to such an extent that for someone to suggest that the legends about the Phoenicians in Greece contained a kernel of truth meant an immediate loss of scholarly status.
THE GREEK RENAISSANCE
It was only in the late 1880s that Schliemann's views on the nationality of the 'Mycenaeans' began to be accepted, and their remains began to be labelled as European; the most active proponent of the new classification was the Greek archaeologist C. Tsountas. Since the establishment of independence, Greek intellectuals had mare a heroic effort to return their country to its 'Hellenic' past. Classical place names were revived and Turkish, Venetian and even Byzantine buildings were levelled to reveal ancient ruins. At the same time, 19th-century Greeks could not claim that Greeks had always been like the idealized image of 5th-century Athenians. Thus the Hellenic genius, though constantly shaped by its past and by the Greek climate and landscape, was seen to have taken many forms, while preserving its national essence. With this background, then, it is not surprising that Tsountas was excited by the new discoveries, which could be interpreted as showing that Greek genius was not limited to its form, but could have others which were equally genuine. Tsountas was conVinced that the Mycenaean remains were traces of Greek antecedents ofClassical civilization, and strongly denied that they had anything to do with the Orient. 'This indigenous art, distinct and homogeneous in character, must have been wrought out by a strong and
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 369
gifted race. That it was of Hellenic stock we have taken be selfevident.,l At other points, however, he did attempt to prove his case. In 1891 the American Journal ofArchaeology published a summary of one
ofhis articles:
Dr Tsountas' conclusions are unfavourable to the Asiatic origin of Mycenaean civilization. His main points are as follows: (I) The representation of divinities may be explained according to Greek ideas; (2) At Mykenai and Tiryns, there are no remains of eatable fishes but there are oysters, and the Greeks of Homer were not ichthyophagous, while there is one word in the Arian tongues to designate the oyster; (3) The Mycenaeans are connected on the one hand with the Italiotes and other Arians, and, on the other, with the Greeks of the historic period whose civilization is a continuation of theirs; (4) The type of Mycenaean house is adopted for a rainy
climate and was imported from the north.2
The error in the first point has been touched on in the Introduction, and will be treated at length in the other two volumes. The second is too tenuous to assess. The third is circular, and in any event was completely outdated by the discovery of,Minoan' civilization in Crete. It is difficult to say what the fourth was based upon, as pitched roofs occur throughout Syria and flat ones appear to have been the most common in the Bronze Age Aegean. All in all, very few ancient historians or archaeologists would take these arguments seriously today, though nearly all would accept the conclusions Tsountas ostensibly drew from
them. Support for Semitic influence on Greece did not disappear immediately. More common sense prevailed at the popular level. An American textbook published in 1895 contained the following:
The nucleus of fact in all these legends is probably this - that the European Greeks received the primary elements of their culture from the East, and this in two ways: first, directly through the settlement in Greece in prehistoric times of Semitic races, particularly the Phoenicians; and secondly indirectly, through Oriental Greeks who, settled on the shores of Asia Minor, in Crete and



370 BLACK ATHENA
Cyprus, and possibly lower Egypt, came into contact with peoples of Semitic or semi-Semitic race ... and transmitted these germs of culture to their kinsmen in European Greece.3
By 1898, the independent scholar Robert Brown was fully aware ofthe issues involved. He attacked the 'Aryanists', who for a century had 'almost wholly ignored or denied the existence of that great mass of Semitic influence, which the Aryo-Semitic School hold is to be found throughout the length and breadth of Hellas.,4 It is interesting that Brown's point ofview, which had in fact been acceptable through much of the 19th century, now seemed eccentric and his whole book, read today, gives a sense of embattlement.
SALOMON REINACH
From the 1880s onwards the intellectual atmosphere of Europe was transformed by the triumph of racial anti-Semitism in Germany and Austria, and its sharp rise elsewhere. This change clearly had many causes, the most significant of which was the mass migration of East European]ews to Western Europe and America. They were used as a scapegoat for the sufferings of the urban workers, in building up an identif;ication ofthe urban workers and the peasants with the capitalists and landowners against these 'aliens'. Anti-Semitism also gained from the secularization and loss of faith after the late 185as, and the success ofother types of racism.
The surge of racism was linked to imperialism and the sense of national solidarity built up in the metropolitan countries against the barbarous non-European 'natives'. Paradoxically, the 1880s and 90S were also the decades in whi€h Europe and North America gained complete control ofthe world. The indigenous peoples ofAmerica and Australia had been largely exterminated, and those of Africa and Asia were totally subdued and humiliated; there was no reason for 'the White Man' to take them into any political account. In this respect antiSemitism can be seen as a European luxury, to be indulged in only when there are no outside enemies.
This, then, was the situation in 1892 when the French polymath
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 37 1
Salomon Reinach wrote of Tsountas' writings: 'these ideas are in the air.'s The following year he himself published a key article along the same lines. The fact that Reinach should champion 'these ideas' shows that they were no longer the sole preserve of Romantics. Salomon Reinach and his distinguished brothers could hardly have been less Romantic. They came from a rich, assimilated]ewish family living in Paris, and Renan and other fashionable intellectuals were frequent visitors to their father's house. The brothers' attitude towards Judaism was complicated. Without religious education themselves, they believed that both it and Christianity were outdated superstitions. On the other hand, Salomon was concerned with preserving]ewish culture and was a patron of the Revue des Etudes Juives for many years. With his brother]oseph he was active in the Dreyfus case, being diametrically opposed to the Catholic Royalist forces behind the new anti-Semitism
in France.6 Salomon Reinach was a scholar of extraordinary breadth and depth. His central interests, however, were in the new disciplines of archaeology and anthropology. Although he was knowledgeable about India and the Near East, his greatest concern was with the explosion of archaeological information coming from Northern, Central and Western Europe. Since he was always adamant that language could not be linked to physical type, his writings in the early 1890S were a double declaration ofindependence: ofEurope from the mirage oriental, and of 'scientific' archaeology and anthropology from philology and its Romantic associations. In Reinach one can see both the virtues and the vices of 20th-century archaeology and Classics: the virtues are common sense and scepticism, while the vices are the requirement of proof when it concerns your opponents - low dating, and contempt for the
Ancients. His long article 'Le mirage oriental' was a two-pronged attack on both India and the Semitic Near East. To use a military analogy of the type favoured by Reinach himself, the demotion of China, Egypt and the Turks had been achieved by an Indo-European-Semitic alliance. In the 1820S only K. O. Miiller, whom Reinach described as 'always in advance of his times', had had the courage to discard Europe's allies.7



372 BLACK ATHENA
By 1885 Europe's conquest of the world was so complete that this courage had become commonplace and could now cast the Indians and the Semites aside.
When the history of the evolution of the historical sciences of the 19th century is told, it will be rightly emphasized that it was in the period from 1880 to 1890 that - timidly at first, but later with an assurance that was better and better justified by the facts - a reaction against the 'mirage oriental' was set in motion; the revindication ofthe rights ofEurope against the claims ofAsia in the obscurity ofthe first civilizations.8
Reinach attacked the Indianist Romantics on three scores. First, he demonstrated that the attempts to link Indian to Greek mythology had failed. Secondly, on language, he cited the young linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who had developed one of the ideas of the so-called NeoGrammarians, who had seen themselves in general revolt against the older generation of scholars. Reinach maintained that Saussure had dethroned Sanskrit from its position as the oldest and purest IndoEuropean language; Saussure now identified 'Proto-Indo-European' as European and, specifically, with Lithuanian. Connected with this was the general shifting of the Urheimat of the Proto-Indo-European language family to the steppes ofthe Ukraine, or even to the Baltic.9 In anyevent, and as his third point, Reinach insisted that the IndoEuropean speakers, if they ever had been a 'race', had been physically absorbed by the indigenous peoples of Europe and that the impressive prehistoric cultures of Western Europe were essentially autochthonous.10 The externalist reasons for Reinach's hostility to Aryan racism and his beliefin the assimilative capacities ofEurope are obvious. His attack on Semitic influences is more complicated. This would seem to be related to a desire to assure"his own cultural identity as an assimilated European, with a consequent lack of Semitic cultural baggage. It may also have been partly derived from the new secular desire'to distance European Jews from the Phoenicians and Carthaginians that we saw above in connection with Moloch. Apart from an assertion of his integrity, his support ofJudaic studies should be seen as serving the
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUT,ION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 373
double function of,preserving for science by killing' that permeated all
19th-century natural science. . . Reinach denied 'absolutely' that there had been any Serrullc or 'Cushitic' (Egyptian) influence on Europe up to the later 'Metallic Age'. He did, however, admit that from the beginning of Phoenician commerce, which he put in the 13th century BC, 'Occidental civilization became ... to a certain extent ... tributary to that of the Orientals.'11 Nevertheless, he maintained that the basis of the civilization had remained resolutely indigenous. Furthermore, he believed that the great prehistoric civilizations of Europe had influenced those of the Orient, and if scholars tried boldly enough this 'passage from the defensive to the offensive' would be successful.12 Reinach agreed with Tsountas that Mycenaean civilization was European, as, he maintained, were similar cultures found around the Mediterranean and Black Sea; and he saw temporal and local differences as the results of superpositions of different tribes 'of the same stock which had reached
different degrees of culture'.13
JULIUS BELocH
Despite his radicalism, by admitting Semitic influence after 1300 BC Reinach had not returned all the way to K. O. Muller. This was achieved in the following year, 1894, by Julius Beloch in a short but immensely influential article, 'The Phoenicians on the Aegean Sea'.14 Beloch was yet another German living in Rome. He taught at its university for fifty years, from 1879 to 1929, and like Humboldt,
Niebuhr and Bunsen, he loved travelling in Italy and cataloguing its . d ,. . I li ltu' 15
monuments; like them he remame Impemous to ta an cu re. For all his success as a teacher and the massive volume of his publications, Beloch seems to have regarded himself as a failure condemned to exile. He appears to have been kept out of German academic life by the great German historian of Rome, Mommsen. Another reason for Beloch's inability to find a satisfactory position in Germany was that he was suspected, rightly or wrongly, ofbeingJewish. Despite - or more probably because of-this suspicion, he was not only
a passionate German nationalist but also a virulent anti-Semite.16



374 BLACK ATHENA
Furthermore, he extended his anti-Semitism into his writing ofhistory: 'A Negro who speaks English is not for that reason an Englishman, and a Jew who spoke Greek was as little a Greek as a Jew who speaks German passes today for German.'17
Julius Beloch wrote prodigiously on both Greek and Italian history, and he is best remembered and respected for his introduction of modern statistical methods into ancient history.18 This application of hard treatment to soft - if not liquid - data went with a rigid requirement for proof, an ultra-critical approach to ancient sources and a passion for low dating. It also went with what I described in the Introduction as 'archaeological positivism', an absolute faith in archaeology as the one 'scientific' source of information on Antiquity. This in turn is related to the punning belief that dealing with objects somehow makes one 'objective', and Beloch and his successors have shown little sensitivity to the fact that archaeological interpretations can be just as susceptible to subjective influences as the interpretation of documents, linguistics and myths.
Professor Momigliano, in his essay on Beloch, refers to 'the implicit conflicts between his liberalism and his nationalism ... between his racism and his cult of numbers,.19 While not denyirig the implicit contradictions, I believe that they are usually 'non-antagonistic'. Ifone broadens 'cult of numbers' to a positivist requirement of proof, these 'implicit conflicts' have been the staple of 19th- and 20th-century Classics. They make up the 'critical-genetic writing ofhistory' for which the right-wing ancient historian Wilcken righdy praised Niebuhr. 20 Although Beloch was attacked by more liberal colleagues like Mommsen and Wilamowitz-Moellendorf - as he is now by Momigliano - his views were only an extreme version of those held by the discipline as a whole. Leaving aside for the moment his treatment ofthe Semites, few Classicists would disagree with his notion that 'science has nothing to
do with mere possibility', which, like him, they combine with frequent use ofthe word 'probably'.21
Like most 20th-century Qassicists, Beloch knew no Semitic language. Nevertheless, citing recent German scholarship, he felt able to deny Phoenician loans into Greek language and place names, however 'alluring' the correspondences might appear. For instance, 'he even
[CU. IX] FINAL OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 375
denied the previously widely recognized relationships between the Jordan and the river name Iardanos, found in Crete and Elis; or between Mt Tabor in Israel and Mt Atabyrion in Rhodes.22 He found Eduard Meyer - himself a stalwart German nationalist - useful in this respect. Meyer was like Adolf Holm in that while radical in his purging of Semitic influences from Greece, he did not deny the Phoenician setdements in the Aegean. Thus he could be cited as objective on the issue.23 Beloch followed K. O. Muller in attributing the Greek and Near Eastern references to common cultic origins to contacts in late Classical or Hellenistic times.24 Beloch took from another scholar the idea that the Phoenicians could not have taught the Greeks to make ships, because there were supposed to be no Semitic loans among Greek nautical terms. Hence they could not have arrived early in the Aegean.25 This argument is doubly misleading. In the first place, the presence ofPhoenicians in the Aegean in, say, the 2nd millennium does not mean that the Proto-Greeks before then lacked ships; secondly, there are, as it happens, a number of quite plausible Semitic etyma for Greek nautical terms which have no known Indo-European roots. Although everybody had conceded the Egyptian origin for baris (skiff), Beloch and his contemporaries did not consider the possibility ofother Egyptian roots in this semantic area. In actuality these can explain an equally large number ofthe terms, which would tally well with the fact that the earliest detailed representations of boats from the Aegean, those from the mid-2nd-millennium murals at Thera, are clearly of Egyptian types.26 Beloch also maintained that Phoenician boats had been too small and inexperdy sailed to brave the open sea. Thus, while they might have been able to creep along the coast to North Africa, they could not have reached the Aegean before the 8th century. Apart from the massive ancient tradition to the contrary, there is now overwhelming archaeological evidence to suggest that they did.27 Here, like most Extreme Aryanists, Beloch naturally preferred to attribute any unavoidable Oriental influences to, or at least through, Anatolia and the land route. In general, one way of distinguishing Broad from Extreme Aryanists is by their attitude to Thucydides. While the Broad Aryanists are uncomfortable with Herodotos' 'Egyptomania' and 'interpretatio



BLACK ATHENA
Graeca', they deeply respect Thucydides. Thucydides did not mention any Egypto-Phoenician colonies on mainland Greece; he did, however, refer to Phoenician settlements on the Greek islands and all around Sicily. Beloch utterly denied their existence, demanding archaeological 'proof' for the 'unsubstantiated' though widespread ancient testimony about them.28 His chiefconcern, however, was over Homer's relatively frequent references to Phoenicia(ns) and Sidon(ians). Like Miiller, Beloch tried to diminish the former by pointing out that phoinix had many different meanings in Greek; he dealt with the irreducible references to Phoenicians by postulating that they belonged to the latest layer ofthe epics which, following Wolfand Miiller, he saw as accretive rather than as single creative acts. Beloch firmly denied that there were any references to Phoenicians at the epics' core, and justified this belief by citing the absence of Phoenicians from the list of Troy's barbarian allies in the Iliad, which he took to be exhaustive for the Aegean and
Anatolia.29 Thus he was able to maintain that Phoenicians could not have come to the Aegean before the end of the 8th century and therefore could not have played a significant role in the formation of Greek civilization.
The modem Belgian scholar Guy Bunnens has written about the men who founded Extreme Aryanism:
In reading their work, one cannot help thinking that these authors were not always ruled by scientific objectivity alone. Reinach and Autran [a French scholar with similar views] insisted on reserving a place in the most distant past for the peoples who dominated world politics in their own period: that is to say, for the Europeans. They maintained that it was unbelievable that nations so important today should have played no role in the past. It was therefore necessary to 'assert the rights of Europe over the claims of Asia'. The historical background at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries explains these new theories. For this was the epoch when the colonialism of the European powers was triumphant ... There was another non-scientific factor. The end ofthe 19th century saw a great current of anti-Semitism in Europe, particularly in Germany
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 377
and France ... this hostility against the Jews extended in history against those other Semites, the Phoenicians.3o
VICTOR BERARD
Interestingly, the pattern Bunnens describes was visible to the perceptive at the time. In 1894, the year in which Beloch published his article, Victor Berard brought out his much more substantial On the Origin ofthe ArkmJian Cults; this had precisely the opposite interpretation of Greek relations with the Phoenicians.
Berard, born in the mountains of the Jura near the Swiss border, made his way by scholarships to a lycee in Paris and the Ecole Normale. In 1887 he went to the French school at Athens and for three years he was involved in excavations in Arkadia, the archetypal rustic and archaic mountainous province in the centre of the Peloponnese; he travelled widely in this remote province, and throughout Greece and the Balkans as well. Berard was a man ofextraordinary energy and determination not only did he continue with his academic career, but he published many books on the contemporary Balkans, Near East and Russia and for some years edited a political journal, the Revue de Paris. He was later elected senator for the Jura. Although radical in politics, he became closely attached to the French navy and developed a fascination for the sea.31
He attributed the themes of his first book on Arkadian cults to two revelations that came to him while living in the province. The first was the extraordinary accuracy of Pausanias, wherever it was possible to check his work by surveying or archaeology. It may seem rather strange that Berard should have been surprised at this discovery when the 2nd-century guidebook had just been so spectacularly vindicated by Schliemann's discoveries in Mycenae and Tiryns, precisely where Pausanias had indicated that there would be significant sites. However, the academic spirit of Besserwissen epitomized by Reinach and Beloch was not so easily disconcerted. Pausanias, like other ancient historians and geographers, continued to be treated with the affectionate condescension considered appropriate for children. In any event, Berard Was convinced that Pausanias had visited the sites he said he had, and



BLACK ATHENA
had described them accurately, and this encouraged the Frenchman to believe other ancient writers too.32
Berard also saw that the Arkadian cults were unHellenic. This was not controversial, because Arkadia had always been associated with the Pelasgians. What did surprise him, and outrage his colleagues, was his conclusion that they were Semitic. For by the late 1880s it was axiomatic that the Phoenicians, as a seafaring people, could not go inland, and Beloch was only systematizing a general belief that Phoenician influence in Greece was very late. Both these suppositions were violated by the idea of substantial Semitic influences in an inland province proverbial for its archaic customs.
Berard fully realized the incongruities. Convinced ofhis conclusions, he began to question the orthodoxy against which they offended, and to look for modern analogies. It led him to make a statement which I shall quote in full, because it beautifully summarizes the main theme ofBlack Athena. When justifying the Phoenician presence in poor, remote and inland 'Pelasgian' Arkadia, he wrote:
... many Europeans today go to Pelasgians, who are no less distant or savage, and for equally slight gains, to discover African Arkadias. The taste for voyages and adventures is not the monopoly ofanyone period or anyone race, and the extraordinary dispersion of Semites in the contemporary world ... It is true that modem travellers have two motives that the Sidonians do not appear to have possessed, at least to the same degree: scientific curiosity and religious zeal. Furthermore, this comparison between the Pelasgians and the modem Congolese may be surprising. However, one should be on guard against two preconceived ideas, or rather two little-reasoned and almost unconscious feelings: ... our European chauvinism and
also what one could call, without too much irreverence, our Greek fanaticism.
From Strabo [the 1st-century geographer] to [Carl] Ritter [the early- I 9th-century geographer trained at Gottingen], all the geographers have taught us to consider our Europe as a land favoured above all others, unique and superior to all the others in beauty . . . in offorms and power ofcivilization ... This way oflooking at
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 379
the world perhaps can influence a large number ofour most habitual thoughts, despite ourselves or almost without our knowledge. We put Europe on one side and Asia or Africa on the other - and between the two, an abyss. When we talk about Asiatic influences on a European country we cannot imagine ... that barbarians could have dared to come to us. Harsh reality forces us to admit that they have flooded in. Certain people even maintain that the cradle ofour first ancestors was far from our Europe, in the centre of Asia. But for our Aryan fathers we have the indulgence ofgood sons in that even ifthey came from Asia, they were not Asiatics, they were for all eternity Indo-Europeans. By contrast, an invasion from Semitic Asia to our Aryan Europe is repugnant to all our prejudices. It seems really as if the Phoenician coast was further away from us than the Iranian plateau. It also appears that the Arab invasion throughout the Mediterranean was only a unique fluke, an unfortunate chance ... which one should not for an instant suppose could be repeated. That the Phoenicians occupied Carthage and possessed· half Tunisia only concerns Africa. That the Carthaginians in their tum conquered Spain and three-quarters of Sicily is [all right because they are] only, as we say, Africa. But when we find Phoenician traces at Marseilles, Praeneste, Kythera, Salamis, Thasos and Samothrace, in Boiotia and in Lakonia at Rhodes and in Crete we do not want, as in Africa, real occupations; we only talk about temporary landings or simple trading posts ... If we go as far as pronouncing the wordsfortresses or Phoenician possessions we hasten to add that they were only coastal establishments ... This European chauvinism becomes a veritable fanaticism when it is not in Gaul, Etrnria, Lucania or Thrace but in Greece that we meet the stranger. At the beginning of this century, all Europe rose up ... the generous Philhellenism of 1820 is no longer fashionable. But one can say that the sentiment has not greatly changed ... We can only conceive of Greece as the country ofheroes and gods. Under porticos ofwhite marble ...
In vain does Herodotos tell us that everything comes from Phoenicia and Egypt. We know what we should think of dear old Herodotos. After twenty years ofArchaeology have provided us, every day and in



BLACK ATHENA
all the Greek states, with indisputable proofs of Oriental influence we are still not allowed to treat Greece as an Oriental province Caria, Lycia or Cyprus because of this. If in our geography we separate Europe from Asia, in our history we separate Greek history from what we call ancient history. We see, nevertheless, from their material and tangible monuments that the Greeks . . . were the pupils of Phoenicia and Egypt, and we see that they borrowed from the Semitic Orient right up to their alphabet; yet we recoil with some shock at the sacrilegious hypothesis that their institutions, their customs, their religions, their rituals, their ideas, their literature and all their primitive civilization could also be inherited from the Orient. (his italics)33
It is interesting to note that for all his boldness, Berard did not - unlike his contemporary, Foucart - seriously propose Egyptian influence; nor did he challenge the holy ofholies, the Greek language. I found it very moving to discover this articulate statement of the beliefs behind my own work written at the height ofimperialism and the beginning of the Extreme Aryan Model. However, this fact itself appears to pose a challenge to my method ofexplaining these scholarly developments in externalist terms - that is, as being heavily influenced by outside social and political developments and the overall intellectual atmosphere. To overcome this challenge, I think it would be useful to look at three tiers of scholarship: the thoughts of individual scholars; their ability to teach and publish; and the general developments in scholarship. I believe that the sociology of knowledge can make only approximate predictions of attitudes and behaviour at the first level. It can do rather better at the second, but it comes into its own only at the third and most general level.
This case belongs to the first and second levels. I believe that a German Berard would have been impossible and an English one unlikely. Schliemann gives a neat example of the· Romantic confines within which even the most creatively radical German could think on these matters. Gladstone, Frazer and Harrison show the relatively broader bounds possible in Britain. Only the professional heretic and brilliant anthropologist of Semitic religion Robertson Smith could
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 381
begin to go beyond them. It was solely in France - with its post-1 870 suspicion of German Aryanism - and among republicans - with their hatred ofCatholic Royalist anti-Semitism - that such thoughts could be thought. One might even say, in a Romantic way, that Berard's regional .. origin was important in that there was a strong tradition of secular and socially radical individualism in both the French and Swiss Jura which made it the model for the 'big three' social anarchists, Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin.34 Another important factor was that Berard was not a 'pure' academic: he had his outside, journalistic and political worlds to give him a wider perspective, and we should note similar . features in Schliemann and Gladstone. This last factor is crucial at the second level. It is only when he or she has a wider, public status that the academic heretic can have any hope of publishing their 'unsound' ideas. In the 19th and early 20th centuries conformist academia did not have the near monopoly on 'respectable' publication now available to the orthodoxies through university presses, which allows academics to ignore arguments published elsewhere. Even then, however, it was difficult for nonconformist scholars and outsiders to obtain a hearing. Going beyond the bounds of orthodox academia has another disadvantage in that it is difficult for the scholar without a discipline, 'going it alone', to know where to stop. On the principle that one might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb, there is a great temptation to 'tell it like it is', regardless of the preconceptions of one's audience. The scholar can easily go beyond not only the bounds ofwhat is possible for the most broad-minded of the orthodox to accept, but also of what is useful to the rigorous development of his or her ideas. Berard, for instance, developed the theory that as there was a Phoenician Mediterranean behind the Greek Mediterranean, there was a Phoenician Odyssey behind the Greek one.35 This wild hypothesis provided 'sound scholars' with an ideal weapon to discredit him and all his ideas. Nevertheless, in the course of his massive and detailed researches on the topic he discovered a large number of plausible Semitic etymologies for Greek place names, and he also established the useful principle of the toponymic 'doublet'. This referred to situations where two apparendy different place names were used for the same or



BLACK ATHENA
nearby places. In such cases he argued that the names were simply Greek and Semitic words for the same thing. Take, for example, the Island of Kythera, to the south-east of the Peloponnese. A Mesopotamian inscription dating back to the 18th century BC had been discovered there in 1849; Herodotos wrote that the temple of Aphrodite Ourania was founded there by the Phoenicians; Aphrodite was frequendy portrayed as wearing a crown.36 Berard noticed that the name of the island's chief harbour was Skandeia, which the best ancient Greek lexicographer, Hesychios, said meant 'a kind of head-dress'. Berard then pointed out that Kythera, the name of the island and its chief city, which had no Indo-European etymology, could be plausibly derived from the Semitic root ""ktr found in the Hebrew keter or kiiteret, 'crown or tiara'.37 Despite the very plausible nature of this and many other toponymic and cultic parallels, the orthodox were able to dismiss Berard and all his works because of the evident impossibility of Odysseus' being a Phoenician. By the time ofBerard's death in 1931 his name had become a byword for crankiness in scholarly circles, but it should be noted that an underground movement continued to hold such ideas 'in the closet'. Furthermore, his books were widely read and appreciated by the public at large, among whom there seems to have been the feeling, expressed by Gobineau fifty years earlier, that Odysseus was in some way Semitic. Berard was particularly well received in Britain, with its remaining identification with and affection for the Phoenicians, and his influence has left a permanent mark on literature inJamesJoyce's Ulysses, which is aboutJews, not Greeks. Nevertheless, Berard was unable to stop the steamroller of Extreme Aryanism in scholarship, and at this third and most significant level the sociology ofknowledge can be used with some accuracy. I am convinced that European politics and society from 1880 to 1939 were so steeped in racism and anti-Semitism, and Classics was so central to the educational and social systems, that - regardless of the historical and archaeological evidence - it would have been impossible to change the image of Ancient Greece in the way Berard wanted to. It was not until after the decline of colonialism and the official delegitimizarion of racism and anti-Semitism between 1945 and 1960 that any
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTI?N OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 383
dent could be made in the models of ancient history based upon
them.
AKHENATON AND THE
EGYPTIAN RENAISSANCE
Neither Berard nor Foucart refers to each other in their works. Although one can only speculate, it is almost as if they felt that one heresy was enough - that it would have been too much to champion both the Egyptians and the Phoenicians at the same time. Nevertheless, it is clear that with the rise of anti-Semitism and hostility to the Phoenicians, there was increasing room for toleration of the Egyptians. Professional Egyptologists now preserved the orthodoxy of the Egyptians' categorical inferiority, but among lay people they were now seen as so exotic as to pose no threat to European
civilization. The figure of the heretic king Akhenaton was particularly admired. As Amenophis IV, this 18th-dynasty pharaoh of the 14th century BC broke away from his family's and dynasty's worship of Amon and the other gods, and tried to establish a monotheism based on the sun disc Aton. From Aton he took the new name Akhenaton. He moved from the traditional capital at Thebes to a new one, built at a site now known as EI Amarna. Soon after his death, however, the reform was ended, the worship of Amon was re-established and the capital returned to Thebes. The destroyed and deserted EI Amarna was left as a perfect site for archaeology and when, in the 1880s, the site was excavated by Flinders Petrie and the outline of the events around the attempted reform was established, a great European enthusiasm for Akhenaton
developed. Egyptologists paid particular attention to giving him and his new religion Aryan, or at least northern, credentials. Petrie claimed that the religion had originated in the Hurrian-speaking northern kingdom of Mitanni, from where, he alleged, Akhenaton's grandfather, mother and wife had all come.38 These beliefs - or modifications of them remained very popular for the next fifty years, as in the following statement by an Egyptologist who was able to turn the reforms into a



BLACK ATHENA
racial matter: 'It must always be remembered that the king had much foreign blood in his veins. On the other hand those with
whom he spoke, though highly educated, were but superstitious Egyptians ...,39
It is generally, and reasonably, agreed today that if the members of the royal family ofthe 18th Dynasty were foreign, they were Nubian. It is equally probable, however, that they were Upper Egyptian, and from their portraits they would seem to have been Blacks.40 On the question ofthe new religion, it was argued that the cult of >itn came from a Semitic cult of>dn, )adOn (lord). Nevertheless, here too the consensus is that the religious reforms can be more piausibly explained as a native Egyptian development, and the schema ofMitanni origin was clearly designed to explain the racial 'impossibility' of 'static' African Egyptians having made a drastic reform - in what Christians had to admit was a positive
direction.41
On the other hand, the enthusiasm for Akhenaton and his reforms even on the part of those who were reconciled to his being Egyptian would seem to indicate that other forces were involved. One of these was a revival of the old belief that the Jews as a people, or Moses as a man, had learnt their religion from Egypt. Scholars were cautious on the issue, but the existence ofa monotheism in the 14th century BC in a neighbouring country made it altogether natural to derive the Israelite form from there. Some writers even believed that worship ofAton was superior toJudaism: 'By no other religion in the world is Christianity so closely approached as by the faith of Akhenaton.,42 Thus Christianity,
either spiritually or historically, could be ultimately derived not from the Semites but from an actual or honorary Aryan, and this is the context in which one should view Freud'sMoses andMonotheism, written in the late 1930S. Freud, however, wanted precisely the opposite of Akhenaton's Christian admirers. In order to alleviate the intense anti-Semitism of the times he appears to have hoped to excuse Judaism and Jews from responsibility for the repression of Christian monotheism, and put the blame on Akhenaton and the Egyptians.43

ARTHUR EVANS AND THE 'MINOANS'
S after the beoinning ofthe 20th century, scholarly discussions had
oon • f"
to include a new factor: the 'Minoan' civilization ofCrete. 0 It came from Arthur Evans' sensational discoveries at Knossos In the 8 os and the other excavations quickly undertaken elsewhere on the
I9 , I .
. land. With the realization that the Mycenaean cu ture was In many
:ays simply a debased form of the Cretan one, the linguistic identifi
O·on of ancient Cretan culture naturally became critically important.
a >h
In Classical times, the Egyptian use of the name Kftiw seems to ave shifted from 'Cretan' to 'Phoenician', and the Greeks seem to have referred to 'Minoans', as well as Phoenicians, as Phoinikes.44 This would suggest a Semitic connection. In any event, it seems to have been accepted, at least in Hellenistic times, that the chief language of early Crete was Phoenician. Lucius Septimius, for instance, wrote in the 4th century AD that when an earthquake in 66 AD had revealed ancient Cretan documents, the Emperor Nero had called in Semitists to interpret them.45 Then, as we saw in Chapter VII, Ernst Curtius was willing to concede that there had been considerable Semitic settlement in Crete, while denying that the local Pelasgians had ever been completely overcome.46 Arthur Evans himself believed that there was a relationship between ancient Cretans, whom he now called the 'Minoans' - after the legendary king Minos of Crete and the commonplace name Minoa - and the Phoenicians; though we should remember that he agreed with Gladstone that the Phoenicians were not purely Semitic, and had received Aegean influence:1-7 Evans was born in 1851 and, though educated at Oxford and Gottingen, belonged to the older and more broad-minded generation. Thus he accepted the possibility ofSemitic, and even Libyan, influence on Crete, and hence on the Aegean as a whole. Nevertheless, his coining ofthe name 'Minoan' encouraged people to think of Crete as a unitary culture which was completely detached from the civilizations of the Middle East. It was easy, therefore, for the academic consensus to come to the conclusion that the Minoan language was neither Hellenic nor Semitic; nor, despite the huge number ofEgyptian objects found at every level in Crete, was it thought to be Egyptian. 'Minoan' was



BLACK ATHENA
generally considered to be related to various Anatolian languages; therefore it was or was not Indo-European, according to one's definition of the latter.,
There was an equal determination to show that the Minoans were 'racially' not Semites. As one scholar wrote in 1911, describing a well-known Minoan fresco:
The cupbearer may indicate their physique, black curly hair, straight nose, long skull; and I, for one, decline to believe that this fine fellow is a Semite or Phoenician, as has been suggested. We know that these people were extraordinarily gifted, especially in the sense of form, and that they were capable ofvery rapid development.48
By this time the Minoans were seen as the most civilized Pelasgians, and the prevailing line was spelled out by two historians ofWestern Asia:
Probably no discovery of more far-reaching importance to our knowledge of the history of the world generally, and of our own culture especially, has ever been found than the finding ofMycenae by Schliemann, and the further finds that have resulted therefrom, culminating in the discoveries of Mr Arthur Evans at Knossos. Naturally, these discoveries are of extraordinary interest to us, for they have revealed the beginnings and first bloom of the European civilization oftoday. Our culture ancestors are neither the Egyptians nor the Assyrians, nor the Hebrews, [note the omission of the Phoenicians even as a possibility!] but the Hellenes; and they, the Aryan Greeks, derived most of their civilization from the PreHellenic people whom they found on the land before them.49
Everything now depended on the Pre-Hellenes! I have mentioned the old compromise that Phoenicians may have come to Greece but that it did not matter, because they had had no effect on the development of Greek civilization. Despite the growing strength of the Extreme Aryan Model, there were still holdouts from the Broad Aryan Model who took this line, and these included Evans; Schliemann's old colleague, the brilliant architect and surveyor Wilhelm Dorpfeldt; and the great polymath Eduard Meyer. They maintained, with Thucydides, that there had been genuine Phoenicians
[CH. IX) FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 387
in the islands, and possibly even at Thebes.so Such thinking was intolerable to the younger generation who had come to maturity after 1885. As the leading earlY-20th-century British historian of Greece and a leading liberal-J. B. Bury put it in 1900, in hisA History ofGreece, which remains standard today: 'The Phoenicians, doubdess, had marts here and there on coast and island; but there is no reason to think that Canaanites ever made homes for themselves on Greek soil or introduced Semitic blood into the population of Greece.,51 Note the use of the two key Romantic and racist words 'soil' and 'blood'! Such attitudes
survived up to and beyond the Second World War.
THE PEAK OF ANTI-SEMITISM,
1920-39
The atmosphere became even harsher in the 1920S. Anti-Semitism intensified throughout Europe and North America following the perceived and actual centrality ofJews in the Russian Revolution. There had always been Jewish bankers and financiers to blame for economic crises and national frustrations; now in the Bolshevik party the previously vague image of a Jewish conspiracy to subvert and overthrow
Christian morality and order seemed to have taken visible form.52 Such feelings were not restricted to Germany, or to vulgar extremists like the Nazis. All over Northern Europe and North America, antiSemitism became the norm in 'nice society', and 'nice society' included the universities. The contemporary social historian Professor Oren has recendy provided detailed background to the imposition oftight quotas to reduce the number of Jewish students at Yale and at associated professional schools during the 1920S, and there is no reason to Suppose that what he describes there did not apply to other colleges and universities in the US, and - in a more disorganized way - in Britain
tOO. 53
It is true that in the 1930S there were a number ofvery distinguished anti-Fascist Classicists whose love of Greek liberty went with their opposition to Nazi and Fascist tyranny. But we have seen that Philhellenism has always had Aryanist and racist connotations, and Classics its conservative bias. Thus there is no doubt that the discipline as a whole



II BLACK ATHENA
shared the prevailing anti-Semitism, if it did not go beyond it. An example of the atmosphere of the times in Classics can be seen in th following letter, found in 1980 on the desk ofProfessor Harry Caplan
Cornell, who was for many years the only Jewish tenured professor of the subject in the Ivy League:
My dear Caplan: I want to second Professor Bristol's advice and urge
you. get into secondary teaching. The opportunities for college pOSItlOns, never too many, are at present few and likely to be fewer. I can encourage no one to look forward to securing a college post.
There is, moreover, a very real prejudice against theJew. Personally, I do not share this, and I am sure the same is true ofall our staffhere.
But we have seen so many well-equipped Jews fail to secure appointments that this fact has been forced upon us. I recall Alfred
Gudeman, E. A. Loew - both brilliant scholars of international reputation, and yet unable to obtain a college position. I feel it is
wrong to encourage anyone to devote himselfto the higher walks of
learning to whom the path is barred by an undeniable racial preju
dice. In this I am joined by all my Classical colleagues, who have authorized me to append their signatures with my own to this letter. (signed) Charles E. Bennet, C. L. Durham, George S. Bristol, E. P. Andrews [27/ 3/1 919] Ithaca.54
In this atmosphere, it is hardly surprising that scholarship should emphasize both the complete separation ofGreece from the Near East and scepticism about Phoenicia's ever having played a positive culturai role in the Mediterranean.
20TH-CENTURY ARYANISM
Despite the beginnings ofa new attack on racism, there was an increase of Aryan racism not only among the extreme and disreputable right, typified by the Nazis, but in regular academic circles. Even the great Marxist prehistorian Gordon Childe shared in it, devoting a whole book to TheAryans, the preface of which linked language and physical race: 'The Indo-European languages and their assumed parent speech have been throughout exceptionally delicate and flexible instruments of
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 389
thought ... It follows then that the Aryans must have been gifted with exceptional mental endowments, if not in the enjoyment of a high material culture.' Childe also referred to the 'certain spiritual unity' of those who share a common tongue. He explained the superiority ofthe Aryan spirit with the following example: 'Anyone who doubts this would
do well to compare the dignified narrative carved by the ... (Aryan) Darius on the rock at Behistun with the bombastic and blatant selfglorification of the inscriptions of the (Semitic) Ashurbanipal or Nebuchadrezzar. ,55
An equally crude racism pervades the first edition of the Cambridge Ancient History, published under the editorship of Bury and his col
leagues in 1924. Intended as a model of the 'new', 'objective' history written collectively by experts about their own particular fields, it
quickly succeeded in gaining canonical status, and the same model of 'Cambridge History' has now been applied to many regions and cultures in the world. The introductory section of the entire Ancient
History is dominated by race. In its first chapter, John Myres, Professor ofAncient History at Oxford, proclaimed his position in the Niebuhrian
ethnic tradition of ancient history:
Ancient peoples come upon the stage ofhistory ... in a certain order ... each with a make-up congruous with the part they will play ...
history presupposes the formation of that character, ... in the greenroom of the remoter past: and the sketch which follows ... is intended ... to describe how men came by these qualities of build and temperament ...56
Accepting the common tripartite view ofhuman races, Myres described 'the Mongol' as 'parasitic', 'infantile' and like 'a quadruped seen from behind'! Having made this jocular reference to their cowardice, Myres proceeded to have his cake and eat it, stating that their group psychology was of a 'peculiar' type which did not 'set much value on human life ... Almost inhuman in his normal apathy, the Mongol can display almost equine savagery when provoked by panic or ill-usage.,57 Blacks came
off surprisingly lightly, though 'the Negro' was described as having a 'carnivorous-looking jaw' and 'great physical strength'. 58
Professor S. A. Cook, in his chapter on 'the Semites', also reflected



390 BLACK ATHENA
the attitudes of the times. Since Semites were fundamentally different from Aryans, there was something very wrong about them. Cook accused them of extremes of optimism and pessimism, of asceticism and sensuality. They possessed great energy, enthusiasm, aggressiveness and courage, but no perseverance, little civic or national loyalty, and little concern about the ethical value ofactions: 'Personal feeling is the source of action, not common sense, or plan or morality.,S9 There is a striking contrast between Cook's 'unethical' Semites and Renan's 'moral' Semites sixty years previously. This would seem to reflect both the additional impact of the Arabs on the amalgam of 'Semites', and ofthe fear oftheJewish-led, Bolshevik hordes following their Hebrew prophet, Marx. Cook was, on the other hand, closer to Renan when he argued that discursive thought was lacking among the Semites: 'In the Hebrew prophets and in Mohammed's Koran we have enthusiasm, eloquence and imagination rather than logical exactness, sustained thought and sweeping comprehension ... The thought does not proceed step-wise, nor is it detached or objective.,6o This type ofthinking continued well beyond the Second World War, forming the basis for the archaeologist, art historian and philosopher of ancient history Henri Frankfort's distinction between the 'mythopoeic' thought of the Ancient Egyptians, Semites and 'modem savages' as opposed to the 'rational' thought of the Greeks and later Europeans.61 A categorical distinction of this kind, of course, plays down the huge extent of'mythopoeic' thought in modem society; but more than this, it is invalidated by the 'objective accuracy' achieved by Mesopotamians and Egyptians in their measurement ofspace and time, and the extent to which they allowed measurement to dominate their lives. To return now to Cook's vision of the Semites in the Cambridge Ancient History as 'middlemen, copying foreign models ... , reshaping what they adopt ... and stamping themselves on what they send out.,62 Here, paradoxically, we have something that sounds remarkably like the tradition of Epinomis, according to which the Greeks had 'perfected'
everything they took from other cultures.63 For Cook, however, the Greeks - together with the Pre-Hellenes - were no longer seen in this way. They were the originators oftheir own culture. The basic views of the scholars who started the Cambridge Ancient
[CH. IX] FINAL OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 391
History can be seen from these introductory chapters. They made it clear that everything now hinged on the Pre-Hellenes, and during the 1920S they and other 'modem' scholars made a determined effort find out as much as possible about these Pre-Hellenes and theIr .relations with the Hellenes themselves. It was in this decade that the great Swedish scholar Martin Nilsson began to demonstrate the links between' Classical Greek mythology and the iconography of the Mycenaean and Minoan civilizations. With this link established, he could no longer accept the easy-going attitudes towards Minoan and Mycenaean contacts with the Middle East held by Evans and the older generation. Fundamental contacts across the East Mediterranean in the Bronze Age were now impossible. The difficulties posed to this denial by the manifest similarities between the architecture and material cultures of Crete, Egypt and Syria were insignificant when compared to the issues at stake, which were nothing less than the integrity and purity of Greek civilization itself.64 We have seen that since the late 19th century there had been a widespread belief that the language or languages of the Pre-Hellenes were in some way 'Asianic' or Anatolian. By the 1920S, however, as Hittite was beginning to be read and Lydian, Lycian and Carian inscriptions became available, the hypothesis was increasingly difficult to sustain, as it was impossible to find parallels with the non-Greek elements in Greek. Nevertheless, this seemed to be the only possible lead, and in 1927 it was used in an attempt to pin down the PreHellenes geographically. In an article written in the new approved collaborative 'scientific' fashion in two parts by an archaeologist, Carl Blegen, and a Classicist, J. Haley, the authors took from the German linguist Paul Kretschmer the hypothesis that there were two PreHellenic place-name elements, -i(s)sos and -nthos, which could be seen as related to the elements -ssa and -nda found in Anatolia. This suggested, they argued, that all these place names came from the ancient pre-Indo-European stratum. Their further claim - that the distribution of these and other non-Hellenic Greek place names corresponded with that of Early Bronze Age settlements - was seen to fit nicely with the hypothesis that the Indo-Europeans had invaded at
the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age.65 (The consensus has since



392 BLACK ATHENA
developed that the invasion came not at this point but with the archaeological break seen in material cultures between Early Helladic II and Early Helladic III.) The two authors' evidence for toponymic and archaeological correspondence is not impressive. They themselves admitted that the place names also fit closely with the area of Late Bronze Age Mycenaean culture.66 Their linguistic arguments were even more shaky. First ofall, toponymic suffixes usually have meanings: -ville (town), -ham (village), -bourne (stream), -ey (island), etc. However, -s(s)os and -nthos refer to all kinds of geographical features, suggesting heterogeneous origins. Secondly, as the contemporary Anatolian linguist Professor Laroche has claimed, the suffixes -ssa, etc., can be explained as Hittite or Luvian and not as Pre-Hellenic.67 Now this argument can be overcome if one sees a close similarity between these Anatolian languages and PreHellenic - though difficult, it is just possible. There is, however, an insuperable obstacle, raised by Paul Kretschmer in later work, which was available before Blegen and Haley published theirs. This was the fact that the suffixes were sometimes attached to Indo-European stems.68 Thus, even though they might in certain circumstances be very old, they could not be taken as indicators ofthe language and culture of the Aegean population before the arrival of the Indo-Europeanspeaking Greeks.69 It says something for the weakness of Ancient Greek toponymic studies that Blegen and Haley's fundamentally flawed article could become a classicstudy, to which students interested in such subjects are still referred. Blegen and Haley's work illustrates the inabilities ofscholars to get to grips with the 'Pre-Hellenes', despite the fact that so much depended on them. They remained essential if it was absolutely impossible that Egypt or Phoenicia had had a fundamental influence on the formation of Greece, and so the late 1920S and early 1930S saw an intensification ofattacks on Phoenicians. The non-Semitic nature of the Minoans was by now so secure that the ancient identification ofthe Minoans with the Phoenicians could be reversed along the lines suggested by Bunsen and Curtius in the 19th century; now it was claimed that when Greek myths mentioned the Phoenicians, they were really referring to Minoans.7o
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 393
TAMING THE ALPHABET:
THE FINAL ASSAULT
ON THE PHOENICIANS
.The leading figure in the climax of the Extreme Aryan Model the American archaeologist Rhys Carpenter, who was a great of Julius Beloch and an opponent ofthe mirage throughout his long life. By 1930 legends of Phoenician settlement m Greece were largely discredited and nearly all the Semitic etymologies for Greek names and words had been ruled out. There remained only the Phoenician alphabet. The poet and novelist Robert Graves claim an Aryan origin for it but, try as they did, scholars could not Ignore that the Greek letters looked like Semitic letters, sounded very SImIlar, and most had corresponding names: alpha/)alep (ox); baa/bet (house), and so on. These had obvious meanings in Late Canaanite, but made no sense in Greek.71 Thus, even though the new scholars would have felt free to dismiss the massive and unanimous ancient testimony that the Greeks had been given their alphabet by the Phoenicians, they could
not avoid admitting its Semitic origin. According to a great range of ancient writings on the subject, the introduction of the alphabet was attributed to Danaos from Egypt or Kadmos from Tyre. This put it in the middle ofthe 2nd millennium Be. However, there was also a passage in the writings of Josephus, the Jewish apologist, in which he asserted - in an anti-Greek tirade specifically attacking the Greeks for their lack of cultural depth - that the Greeks were only boasting when they claimed that they had learnt letters from Kadmos. In fact, according to him, they had been illiterate at the time ofthe Trojan War.72 Not surprisingly,Josephus' version was preferred by the Romantic Hellenists when considering their imge of Homer the illiterate bard. Nevertheless, most scholars preferred to accept the ancient consensus, for the authenticity of the legends surrounding Kadmos' foundation of Thebes was not seriously chal
lenged until the end of the century. . This early date, however, was not acceptable to Reinach and Beloch. Reinach lowered the period oftransmission to the 13th or 12th century, at which time he believed Phoenician influence had begun.73 Beloch



394 BLACK ATHENA
suggested the 8th century as his date for the first contacts, and he supported this with four arguments. In the first place, he maintained that there were no datable Greek inscriptions from before the 7th century; secondly, he stated that the only reference to writing in Homer was obscure, and it was possible that the poet and his audience did understand reading; thirdly, he claimed that the way from Phoenicia to Greece went through Cyprus, which did not use the alphabet until Alexander's time; and fourthly, he argued that the names of the letters resemble Aramaic, not Phoenician, forms; thus the alphabet must have been borrowed after Aramaic became dominant in the Levant in the late 8th century?4
The dubiousness ofBeloch's first point, the argument from silence, has been and will be discussed elsewhere in BlackAthena. On the second point, despite the assurances ofBeloch and many later scholars that the reference is ofno consequence, there is no doubt that Homer did once refer to semata /ygra (baneful signs) which were 'written,.75 The lack of an alphabet in Cyprus was the result of local conditions which meant that the island failed to respond at the time when the alphabet was transmitted from the Levant to the Aegean. It gives us no indication, one way or the other, ofwhen the transmission took place. Finally, we have already seen that Beloch knew no Semitic languages, and he was wrong when he claimed that the Greek letter names reflect Aramaic pronunciations. The 0 in the letters iota and rho reflect a sound shift which took place in Canaanite, but not in Aramaic. In any event, Beloch's ideas on the alphabet were not taken seriously by his contemporaries, and the debate on the dating of the alphabetic introduction was even more fluid during the first quarter of the 20th century than that between the Broad and Extreme Aryan Models as a whole. A likely cause for this openness was the relative influence of Semitists and Jews in the study of Semitic epigraphy, which was essential for any serious dating. In general, however, there is no doubt that the tendency was for the date ofthe transmission to be lowered, for the same reasons that brought the Extreme Aryan Model at power; not forgetting the now familiar and increasing 'positivist' desire for 'proof', as well as the desire to give archaeology and ancient history what was thought to be the certainty of natural sciences.
[eH. IX] FINAL SOLU!ION OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 395
The lowering process culminated in 1933 when Professor Rhys Carpenter, an archaeologist and an avowed outsider to epigraphy,
proposed a date around 720 Be for the date of of the alphabet to Greece. The reasons he gave for domg this were twofold: that the earliest Greek letters resembled those of 8th-century Phoenician; and that no Greek alphabetic inscriptions had been found from before that date, 'the argument from silence'.76 This lowering of the date was only one of three attempts Carpenter made to diminish the importance ofthe introduction ofthe alphabet and to make it less likely that it could have been accompanied by any other significant cultural borrowings. Another attempt took the form of making a categorical distinction between consonantal and vocalized alphabets. The invention ofvowels was attributed - in my opinion wrongly - to the Greeks.77 Making it clear that he thought vowels were beyond the capacity of Semites, Carpenter referred to 'that brilliantly Greek creation of the vowels', thus crediting the Greeks with having invented the first 'true'
alphabet.78 Carpenter's third attempt was to remove the place ofborrowing as far as possible from Mainland Greece. He suggested Crete, Rhodes and later - most implausibly, for the reason I have given above: that it did not use an alphabet- Cyprus. In the late 1930S, however, the archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley showed to his satisfaction that there had been an 8th-century Greek colony at AI Mina on the Syrian coast, and sug
gested that the Greeks could have learnt the alphabet there.79 Despite the tenuousness of this claim - and the complete lack of early Greek inscriptions within 500 miles ofthe site - Classicists and archaeologists, including Carpenter, enthusiastically accepted this as the point of
transmission.8o Why should Carpenter, who made such a fetish of the need for attestation when it came to time, have been so lax in regard to place? One reason was that he saw it as more befitting the 'dynamic' Greek culture to have brought the alphabet home rather than to have received it passively. His second reason was still more sinister. His leading successor in the field of epigraphy, Professor Lilian Jeffery, has
summarized the case:



BLACK ATHENA
The second point was well brought out by Professor Carpenter: that only in an established bilingual settlement of the two peoples, not merely a casual Semitic trading post somewhere in the Greek area, will the alphabet ofone be taken over by the other.81
This imaginative reconstruction takes it as axiomatic that 'Semitic' colonization was categorically more 'casual' than that of the Greeks, a contention for which there is little ancient authority, and for which see Berard's discussion on pp. 378-80.82 However, the reason for insisting on the small scale and transitory nature ofPhoenician settlements has a powerful ideological aspect: they had to be so if Greece was to remain the racially pure childhood and quintessence of Europe. Lest anyone should think that this is exaggerated, I should like to repeat the passage from Bury, which was written in connection with the transmission of the alphabet:
The Phoenicians, doubtless, had marts here and there on coast and island; but there is no reason to think that Canaanites ever made homes for themselves on Greek soil or introduced Semitic blood into the population of Greece.83
Alphabetic transmission had to have taken place outside Greece; otherwise it would have required substantial Phoenician settlement, and hence 'racial' mixing.
To return to the question of the time oftransmission. Why did Rhys Carpenter insist on a late-8th-century date which could be - and has been - so easily falsified by later discoveries? Its first advantage was that it could explain why the essentially 'passive' Phoenicians had sailed west; they had been directed by the Assyrians, who had a major impact on the Phoenician coast only in the mid-8th century. We saw the preference for only 'partially Semitic' Assyrians when discussing Movers and Gobineau.84 What is more, the late date meant that what Phoenician influence there had been in Greece had come not in the country's formative period, but only after the establishment of the polis and the beginning of colonization - two institutions that could otherwise be construed as Phoenician.85
When challenged, Rhys Carpenter acknowledged that his late dating
[CH. IX] FINAL SOLUTI<?N OF THE PHOENICIAN PROBLEM 397
required a uniquely rapid spread and of the alphabet throughout not only the Aegean but Italy and Anatoha as well. Never
theless, he responded:
I hold it worse than absurd. I hold it unGreek and hence unthinkable that it [the alphabet] should have lingered for any considerable lapse of time among this intensely active people, in passive abeyance,
known but unutilized. Truly the Greek climate does miracles to a
• • 86
young alphabet; we can almost see It growmg.
Apart from the Romantic images of climate, trees: youth and the passage illustrates the power and the continUIty of the
already present in Humboldt, that all normal laws and are suspended when it comes to the Ancient Greeks and that It IS mappropriate - ifnot improper - to judge them as one would other peoples. Not all scholars were swept away by Carpenter's rhetoric. Hans
Jensen, for instance, the broadest alphabetic scholar of the cenn.rry: continued to maintain a IOth- or 11th-century date. But the onl; direct challenge to Carpenter came from the B.J. Ullman, who - in an article Carpenter did not CIte - had preViously proposed a date of the 12th century or earlier. Ullman agreed that many Archaic Greek letters deviated from the forms on the 9thcentury Phoenician or Moabite inscriptions; but he saw them as deriving from earlier Levantine types, not as resembling later insisted that an alphabet was as old as its oldest letter. Ullman Identified the letters of the earliest datable Phoenician that on the sarcophagus ofAhiram King of Byblos, as being very similar to 9th-century ones, but said that where the letters differed, the earlIer ones were closer to the Greek forms.88
In his rejoinder to Ullman, Carpenter implicitly took the opposite position - that an alphabet should be seen as being as recent as its latest letter. That is, he focused on K and M, the Greek forms of which do resemble the later Phoenician ones.89 Even though this did not address Ullman's arguments about the 'older' letters, Ullman could not withstand Carpenter's vigorous forensic style, the anti-Semitic Zeitgeist and the relative power of Classics and Semitic studies. Indeed, Classicists



BLACK ATHENA
welcomed Carpenter's conclusions enthusiastically. They confirmed the belief at the Romantic heart of the discipline that Homer(s) had been illiterate. For there had been some disconcertion at Evans' discovery of writing on Crete and evidence pointing in the same direction from the Mainland. However, the linear scripts could plausibly - if wrongly - be said to have died out with the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces; hence Carpenter's low date was very welcome in that it established a long 'Dark Age' of illiteracy in which folkish Homer or Homers could have sung with barbaric northern vigour. It is interesting to note that it was during the 1920S that Professor Milman Parry began his study of Serbian folk epics to show that the Iliad and Odyssey could have been composed without writing.90 Carpenter's securing of an illiterate and impermeable 'Dark Age' held another attraction for upholders ofthe Aryan Model. The break in cultural continuity it imposed allowed people to discount what Greeks of the Classical and Hellenistic periods had written about their distant past. This completed the discrediting not only ofthe Ancient but ofthe Broad Aryan Model. In the spirit ofthe age, then, Classicists were won over by Carpenter. Where Beloch had failed in the 1890s, Carpenter - using very much the same arguments - succeeded in the 1930S. Most Semitists made accommodations to the line laid down by the hegemonic discipline, but some - particularly the Jewish ones - were less happy. Ullman remained unconvinced, and he and others - notably Professor Tur-Sinai in Jerusalem - continued to see it as obvious that the Greek alphabet could not have derived from Iron Age Phoenicia but must have originated from an earlier Canaanite script.91 From 1938 to 1973 there was no serious challenge to Carpenter's ultra-low dating ofthe Greek borrowing ofthe alphabet. The reduction ofthe alphabet removed the last serious obstacle to the establishment of the Extreme Aryan Model, and by the outbreak of the Second World War Classicists and ancient historians were convinced that their disciplines had entered the scientific age. To put it in modem terms, a paradigm had been established. Itwas no longer tolerable for a 'scholar' to suggest that there had been any significant Egyptian or Phoenician

[CH. ,
influences on the formation ofGreece. Anyone who now did so was - if possible _ expelled from the academic community, or at least labelled
'cranky'.



CHAPTER X
THE POST-WAR SITUATION
The return to the
Broad Aryan Model, 1945-85
W
ITH THIS CHAPTER we have come full circle. I started this
with about present, since then have tned to make them mtrude as httle as possIble. At this point, I hope the reader who is essentially interested in the world today will gain some reward for her or his hard work with the last nine chapters. I hope too that she or he will have been convinced of the contemporary relevance of history and historiography.
This chapter contains two stories. I believe that the first is close to a happy ending: it is the movement, led mainly by Jewish scholars, to eliminate anti-Semitism in the writing ofancient history, and to give the credit due to the Phoenicians for their central role in the formation of Greek culture. In the terms used here, these scholars are close to re-establishing the Broad Aryan Model.
Without going into the internalist factors involved in this shift, we can say that from externalist point of view, the successful restoration of the Phoenicians' reputation required two preconditions, both ofwhich have been fulfilled. The first was the reincorporation of Jews into European life; the second has been the great emphasis, within Jewish culture, on intellectual pursuits and the respect for academia. The former has removed the conceptual barriers of anti-Semitism that
[CH.X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION 401
made it impossible to recognize the Phoenician and Canaanite achievements; the latter means that even the tiny number ofJewish scholars concerned with these issues can have a powerful effect on the academic status quo.
The second story contained in Chapter X concerns the rejection of the tradition ofEgyptian colonization in Bronze Age Greece; its end is not so clearly in sight. One or two German scholars are trying to reinstate the tradition of Egyptian colonization, but there is no broad movement within academia for the restoration of the reputation of Ancient Egypt in this respect. Moreover, the Ancient Egyptians, unlike the Phoenicians, have no 'natural' champions. Islamic Egyptians have a deep ambivalence about Ancient Egypt, made more acute by the uses made ofits image by corrupt and pro-Western governments to promote a non-Arab idea of modern Egypt. Possibly because of this - but more likely because of an acceptance of the massive power of Western scholarship - Egyptian scholars have not challenged the orthodoxy on the world role ofAncient Egypt or investigated its influence overseas. The only likely champions of Ancient Egypt are Copts and small groups of Mrican and American Blacks. The former have been remarkably quiet on this issue and the latter are much more concerned with proving that Egypt is truly Mrican and black than with its influence on Greece. And where they are concerned with this influence, they have focused on transmission through Greeks' studies in Egypt, and what they see as the wholesale plundering and appropriating of Egyptian philosophy and science after the Alexandrian conquest.
An even more powerful inhibitory factor to the restoration of the Egyptian aspect ofthe Ancient Model has been the fact that, unlike the champions of the Phoenicians, these black scholars have been outside academia. Thus most of the writing on what G. G. M.James called the Stolen Legacy - Egyptian cultural achievements stolen by the Greeks has been circulated among friends or published in very small editions; rapidly sold out to a passionately concerned public, but not considered as scholarship by academics, and not even stocked by libraries. An illustration of this is the fact that I had been studying these issues for eight years before I became aware ofthis literature. After making this contact, I found myselfvery torn. On the one hand, my training made me recoil at the lack of so many of the outward



402 BLACK ATHENA
trappings of scholarship; on the other, I found that my intellectual position was far closer to the black literature than it was to orthodox ancient history.
I believe that my feelings are significant. There must be other scholars who have been shaken by the revelation ofthe Phoenician role in the formation of Greece and the political aspects of its suppression, and have begun to question not only the Extreme Aryan Model but the Broad one too. And from the hundreds ofdiscussions I have had on this subject, I know that the ideological objections to the Ancient Model can no longer be stated in public. In private they may still be believed in, but I am convinced that even this attitude - though common in society at large - is not very frequendy found in liberal academia.
It seems, then, that the Aryan·Model is being maintained very largely by its own tradition and academic inertia. Neither ofthese forces should be underestimated; nevertheless, they have been considerably weakened by a number ofstarding internal developments - all ofwhich show that the Bronze Age civilizations were much more advanced and cosmopolitan than had been thought, and that in general the ancient records are more reliable than more recent reconstructions. Given these externalist and internalist contexts, I am convinced that even the Broad Aryan Model is untenable and that the Ancient Model will be restored at some point in the early 21st century.
THE POST-WAR SITUATION
The Second World War and the public revelation of the Holocaust removed the legitimacy ofanti-Semitism and racism, but the new stated value of racial equality took a long time to be institutionalized. In practice, in both Europe and North America, anti-Semitism remained prevalent throughout most of society, including academia, despite the distinguished role'played byJewish scholars who had fled to Britain and the United States. Many American universities continued to exclude Jews or to impose strict quotas on them until the late 1950S or early
1960s.1 As with the anti-Semitism between the Wars, the British institutions are less easy to pin down, but it would seem likely that a similar situation existed there. From the late 1950S, however, Jewish
[CH. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
students and academics became completely accepted in the leading universities. This process also took place in Classics, and by the 1970S many ofthe dominant figures in the field were Jewish. Racial prejudice against Africans and Asians was - and is - a far more formidable barrier. The American Supreme Court did not begin to move against legal racial discrimination until the mid- I 950S, and it was not until the 1960s that most - though by no means all - US Blacks gained the right to vote. These legal and political reforms have not changed other aspects of the situation of Blacks and South Asians. Some Blacks and non-European immigrants in industrial countries 'gained economically during the sustained boom from 1945 to 1973, but the differentials between races remained the same, or worsened. With the slump ofthe 1970S and 80S non-Europeans have lost more, and lost it faster, than Whites throughout Europe and North America. , The writing of history has also been affected by events in the Third World, which I shall discuss below. Here it would seem fair to say that the foundation and military expansion of Israel after 1949 did more to reduce anti-Semitism than the revelation of anti-Semitism's consequences in the Holocaust. For their part, Whites were generally not impressed by Indian independence in 1947 or the 'wind of change' of the 1950s, in which Britain and France found it expedient to grant political independence to their tropical colonies. In any event, neocolonialism maintained the economic power ofthe metropolitan countries. Moreover, real problems in the quasi- or newly independent countries and the media's racist treatment ofthem continued to sustain the dogma that only Whites had the capacity for self-rule. However, even more important from our point of view was the maintenance of European cultural hegemony: there was no real change in the understanding and teaching of history. The 'European chauvinism' denounced by Victor Berard still flourished. As late as the 1960s, for instance, the only course on the Third World taught in the Cambridge History Tripos was on 'The Expansion of Europe'. There were, however, significant changes - first, the extraordinary economic success ofJapan. This was coupled with the reunification of China and its becoming a major power which, after 1970, the West courted as an ally against the Russians. Hider had given the Japanese



BLACK ATHENA
'honorary Aryan' status in the 1930S, and his view became generally accepted by 1960. During the 1970s, the Chinese too began to receive this accolade, and there would now seem to be a general Western perception ofEast Asians as somehow different but equal. Indians, too, received slightly more respect as the subcontinent recovered from the horrors ofpartition. On the other hand, the image ofthe Romantic Arab sheikh has changed into one of bloated oil princes and Palestinian 'terrorists'. All the old Christian hatred of Islam has been revived and turned against Arabs, and - unlike the 19th-century European admiration of the Persians - Islamic Iran is portrayed in diabolical terms. Moreover, despite independence, Africa and its diaspora are still seen as hopeless, and Blacks are thought ofas the lowest form ofhumanity. I have listed these crude stereotypes not because most academics accept them - though some clearly do - but because all ofus, except for Moslems but including many Asians and Africans, are at some level influenced by them. Many of the Third World movements, of which Negritude is an example, have accepted the European conceit that only Europeans can think analytically; as a result of this many black and brown intellectuals have tended to deny their own analytical intelligence and retreat into the 'feminine' qualities of community, warmth, intuition and artistic creativity - which, interestingly, Gobineau was prepared to concede to the Blacks. In other words, it has not only been white Gentiles who have found it easy to accept the myth of the 'Greek miracle' and the consequent categorical superiority of 'Western' civilization. Nevertheless, there has been some peeling away from this consensus, and we shall look at it later in this chapter.
DEVELOPMENTS IN CLASSICS,
1945-65
Even in the 19th century, cautious historians had often opened their work by stating that linguistic and racial boundaries did not always coincide - before going on to treat them as if the two were identical.2 After 1945 this became the only acceptable approach, and scholars always referred to linguistic divisions rather than racial ones. On the other hand, while racism was damaged by the War, science came out of
[eH. Xl THE POST-WAR SITUATION
it triumphant. Thus the passage oftime gave the Extreme Aryan Model increasing legitimacy, as almost no one doubted that it was the 'scientific truth' arrived at by archaeology and other modern methods. The Ancient Model, no longer seen as a coherent scheme to be confronted and overcome, had disintegrated into a collection of ludicrous legends
which 'no one today' could begin to take seriously. The debates on early Greek history, which were fought with great passion, took place almost entirely within the Extreme Aryan Model. There was great discussion as to when the Hellenes had arrived in Greece: until the 1950S a significant minority of scholars maintained, m'the legends about the 'Return of the Heraklids' and the Dorian Invasion, that the Aryans had swept south only at the end ofthe Bronze Age. Despite the overwhelming discrediting of this view by Michael Ventris' decipherment of Linear B as Greek, a number of diehards
continued to hold these views until the 1970S.3 This decipherment is accepted as being the greatest internal development in the field since the discoveries of Schliemann and Evans and, as with Schliemann, it was made by an amateur. Michael Ventris, an architect, had attempted to crack the published corpus of Linear B texts cryptographically, assuming that they were written in a language of the mysterious Pre-Hellenes. In 1952, however, he tried to match them with Greek, and with that combination he succeeded in deciphering
them. I want to return to a theme raised in my Introduction to this volume. Why should both these breakthroughs have been made by outsiders? In Schliemann's case there was his simple-mindedness and his faith in the Ancients, both ofwhich scholars ofhis period had been taught to avoid at all costs. Ventris, too, was 'simple-minded' in his juxtaposition of the Linear B corpus with Greek, rather than with some abstruse and scarcely understood Anatolian language or some concoction made from 'Pre-Hellenic' elements in Greek.4 Furthermore, there was the fact that Linear B represented Greek in an extremely crude way: to read it as Greek did violence to all the refinements that Classicists have spent
their lives striving for. The view that no Classicist could have done it is strengthened by a comparison with the Cypriot syllabary: this was used to represent Greek



BLACK ATHENA
on Cyprus until Hellenistic times and was almost equal to Linear Bin the roughness of its approximation of Greek phonetics. It was deciphered by George Smith, who knew little Greek, and Samuel Birch who, though a competent Hellenist, was essentially an Egyptologist and an ASsyriologist, and therefore used to the looseness of connections required for such work.5 This argument - that Hellenists are too refined for such work, at least in its initial stages - will come into play in the :olume BlackAthena, when I shall try to establish Egyptian and SenutiC loans 10 Greek with correspondences that would be
acceptable to most comparative linguists but appallingly crude to Hellenists.
Given the threat he posed to professionalism, it is remarkable how and Ventris' work was accepted.6 This can partly be explamed by his personal charm; his astuteness in asking a sound and essentially conservative Classicist, John Chadwick, to· be his collaborator; and the discovery of corroborative evidence to support his interpretation from newly discovered tablets. On the other hand, there is no doubt that when they came to consider the matter, Classicists saw the new decipherment as supporting the Extreme Aryan Model, because it extended both the time depth and the geographical range ofthe Greeks. There were, however, some flies in the ointment. The first ofthese was that the name ofthe god Dionysos was found on a Linear B tablet. In the Greek tradition, Dionysos was generally supposed to be a latecomer.
therefore Classicists had argued about his cult having arrived 0; developed in the 6th; or 7th century BC. His appearance in the 13th pushed things back almost to the date suggested by the AnCIents - the 15th. However, this has been all too confusing and although no one could deny the attestation, most scholars continue to argue along the old lines.
More serious than this, however, was the discovery in Linear B of Semitic and Egyptian personal names and many of the admitted loan words for allegedly exotic goods - spices, gold, and so on _ which been since the I 920S to have been introduced by the Phoeruclans after theIr supposed arrival in the late 8th century. Here too the. incongruity with the Extreme Aryan Model was not noted by Hellemsts until Semitists confronted them with it. In general, the
[CU. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
decipherment strengthened the Extreme Aryan Model and encouraged scholars to continue looking to the north for origins by invasion. During the 1950S a consensus developed that Indo-European-speaking ProtoGreeks had arrived in the Aegean basin at the end ofthe Early Helladic nceramic period, in approximately 2200 BC.
THE MODEL OF
AUTOCHTHONOUS ORIGIN
The only scholars who both accept the reading of Linear B as Greek and reject the idea ofthis Hellenic invasion are the proponents ofwhat , they call 'the model ofautochthonous origin'. Led by the grand old man ofancient history in Bulgaria, Vladimir Georgiev, and the distinguished but ultra-isolationist archaeologist Colin Renfrew, they deny that Indo-European was brought to Greece from a homeland north of the Black Sea. Instead they argue that Proto-Indo-European was never anything but a congeries of dialects spoken over Anatolia and the Balkans, of which the Greek spoken in Greece was one.7 This model belongs to the isolationist or anti-diffusionist paradigm which has been dominant in archaeology and anthropology since the 1940s; its dominance seems to be related to a reaction against colonialism, of which diffusionism is clearly an academic reflex.8 Linguists and Classicists tend to be less ready than these other scholars to abandon the concept of diffusion, however, because it frequently provides a satisfactory explanation for the relationships within known language families. They have also used the powerful argument that diffusion through conquest and migration has played an important role in recorded history, and there is no reason to suppose that prehistory was significantly different in this respect. The Model of Autochthonous Origin represents a return to the position of Karl Otfried Miiller in the 1820S and 30S, before the development of the Aryan Model. As with Miiller, however, its proponents are very much in the northern and European modes ofthought, and ifanything they are more hostile than the Aryanists to the traditions ofcolonization from the Near East at the end ofthe Middle Bronze Age. But this denial and its lack of a Pre-Hellenic substratum leaves the



BLACK ATHENA
Model of Autochthonous Origin without any explanation for the non-Indo-European elements in Greek, a weakness that is exploited by defenders of the Aryan Model.9 Nevertheless, probably because they are working within the dominant paradigm in archaeology, proponents of the Model of Autochthonous Origin feel able to neglect this apparendy fundamental flaw. And since both it and the Aryan Model exclude the possibility of Near Eastern setdement, the clash between them is not direcdy relevant to the topic ofBlackAthena, where the focus has been on the conflict between the Ancient and Aryan models.
EAST MEDITERRANEAN CONTACTS
Up to the mid- 1960s, hatred of the Phoenicians seems, if anything, to have increased. Rhys Carpenter pressed on with his campaigns to lower the dates of alphabetic transmission and to limit the extent of Phoenician colonization, and his proposals were generally accepted. 10 The possibility of colonization at Thebes was generally dismissed. In fact, the most determinedly Aryan interpretation of the Kadmeian legend, that by the French scholar F. Vian, appeared in 1963.II Many writers continued to deny or at least minimize the extent of contact around the East Mediterranean; in 1951 the English ancient historian R. Meiggs felt able to write, in his revision of Bury's history,
There would seem to be a coherent body of literary evidence that there were close relations in the Bronze Age between the Mycenaeans and the Phoenicians, or other Semites. Unfortunately this evidence is less coherent and less cogent than it appears to be ... More serious is the increasing doubt whether any of the Near Eastern peoples came into the Aegean or the Western Mediterranean during the Bronze Age. 12
As increasing archaeological evidence of contacts between the Aegean and the Levant accumulated, it was assumed that these must have been the result of Greek initiative: '... after the close of the MM [Middle Minoan] II period, and throughout the later part of the 2nd millennium, only the sailors, merchants and craftsmen of Mycenaean Greece can justifiably lay claim to the honour of forming the links
[CH. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
connecting the Aegean with the Orient.,13 For the reasons touched on in Chapters VIII and IX, many Semitists seem to have been unwilling to study Phoenician history, which until the 1960s was largely left to Classicists and Philhellenes. In 1961 the Lebanese scholar D. Baramki revived the theory - put forward by Evans at the tum ofthe century and Woolley in the 1920S and 30S - that what success the Phoenicians did have came from an infusion of Aryan blood; while the Classically trained D. B. Harden, in his The Phoenicians, published in 1962, accepted the idea of Mycenaean control of the sea during the Bronze Age} 4 '\ In the face ofnew archaeological discoveries ofcontacts, and the fact that the flow ofinfluence would appear to have been from east to west, there were reactions not only against the theories that denied all contacts, but also against those that attributed these contacts entirely to the activity of the Mycenaeans and later Greeks. The great American scholar William Foxwell Albright, doyen of Semitic studies until his death in 1971, argued for the 9th or even lOth century for Phoenician colonization.ls The Australian ancient historian William Culican, in a strikingly bold work, stressed the centrality, originality and influence of the Levant in the 2nd millennium, but he studiously avoided the Ancient Model and the question of whether or nor the West Semites had had a profound and/or long-lasting impact on Greek civilization. 16
Furthermore, the denial ofthe tradition ofKadmos, the weak link in the Extreme Aryan Model, continued to provoke doubt. The great Marxist Classicist George Thomson in 1949, and his colleague R. F. Willetts in 1962, maintained that the Kadmeioi were a Semitic tribe who went from Phoenicia to Crete and on to Thebes. 17 Also in the 1960s, the Lebanese historians D. Baramki and Nina Jidejian also believed that there had been a Phoenician setdement at Thebes, though they maintained that this had taken place during the Iron Age.18 Some historians went beyond this, accepting not only the Kadmeian legends but those concerning Danaos too. The Classicist G. Huxley argued for these propositions in his Crete and the Luvians, published in 1961; as his tide suggests, however, he was more concerned with the respectable Anatolian connection than he was with those to Egypt and the Levant. It



410 BLACK ATHENA
is also interesting to note that the book was published privately.19 A much more startling development was the publication the following year of the Classical archaeologist Dr Frank Stubbings' chapter on 'The rise of Mycenaean civilization' in the 3rd edition ofVolume 2 of the CambridgeAncient History.20 Here, Stubbings accepted the Ancient Model to the extent that he argued for an invasion from Egypt and that Hyksos principalities had been established in Greece; he also claimed that this interpretation was backed by recent archaeological evidence to prove that there had been Near Eastern and Egyptian influence in Greece at the beginning ofthe Mycenaean period.21 Another Classical archaeologist went even further. Emily Vermeule, Professor ofthe subject at Harvard, suggested that Mycenaean civilization had retained contacts with Egypt and Phoenicia throughout its existence. In 1960, when describing the causes ofits collapse, she wrote as follows:
... it is clearly not the Mycenaeans who disappeared, but Mycenaean civilization. The strength ofthat civilization depended greatly upon invigorating contact with Crete and the East, from the time of the Shaft Graves [the earliest tombs discovered by Schliemann at Mycenae] onward. When contact was broken, Mycenaean culture drifted so far in sterility that it is hard to recognize.22
But we should remember that these views were, and are, by no means typical. Most modern British archaeologists and historians of Mycenaean Greece - Chadwick, Dickinson, Hammond, Hooker, Renfrew and Taylour, for instance - maintain that Mycenaean civilization was the of indigenous development. The evident Greek cultural borrowings from the Near East and Africa have been seen as introductions through Greek initiative: the return of mercenaries, trade, or even tourism in the Middle East.23 Having absolutely ruled out the possibility of Egyptian or Canaanite influence on Greek culture or language, the academic Establishment could use this 'fact' to attack invasion hypotheses based on Greek tradition or archaeological parallels. Dr Stubbings tried to get around this in connection with the Hyksos:
THE POST-WAR SITUATION 411
That their arrival is not accompanied by any more wholesale Egyptianizing is perfectly compatible with what we know of the Hyksos in Egypt. There they had introduced little but new military techniques and organization, they do not represent a mass move
ment of population, rather they were a warrior caste ... They
24
introduced no new language ...
I think there are real problems with his analysis of the impact of the Hyksos in Egypt. We know very little directly about the Hyksos period there. In the long term, however, there is no doubt that despite the "' resurgence of Egyptian nationalism and culture in the 18th Dynasty, a .major cultural transformation took place during the period of foreign rule. Dr Stubbings does seem to be right in seeing the Hyksos as a warrior caste; but like the Mongols, who churned up the cultures of Eurasia, the Hyksos seem to have been culturally formative in transmitting other civilizations - Semitic into Egypt, 'Minoan' and Egyptian into Greece, etc. Greece, however, lacking the massive tradition of civilization of Egypt, was much more susceptible to change; therefore the Hyksos were likely to have had an altogether greater influence in the
Aegean. Historiographically, on the other hand, Stubbings' position was a return to the argument of Connop Thirlwall in the 1830S and Adolf Holm in the 1880s: that though there may have been Egyptians and Semites in Greece, it did not matter because they had had no longterm effects. Although breaking with the crude racism of the period 1885-1945, Stubbings, like his predecessors, firmly rejected the
Ancient Model. The 'recent' archaeological evidence upon which Stubbings had based his claim was not enough to shake the well-entrenched Extreme Aryan Model. During the 1960s, however, a number of new finds did have a significant bearing on the relative importance ofLevantines and Greeks in the East Mediterranean. In 1967, the marine archaeologist George Bass published his report on the only Late Bronze Age ship then excavated in the region. Although he maintained that this trading vessel, sunk off Cape Gelidonya in Southern Turkey, was Syrian, Bass did not go on to claim that this indicated that all shipping at this period



412 BLACK ATHENA
was Canaanite. However, from this and other evidence he argued that it was clear that Levantine trade had been centrally important during the
Late Bronze Age.25 This undercut the widely accepted but unbased claims for non-Semitic Minoan and Mycenaean thalassocracies or sea kingdoms and finally destroyed the argument, used by Beloch, that Phoenician boats were incapable ofreaching the Aegean before the 8th century. In 1963 and succeeding years a large number of Near Eastern objects, including thirty-eight cylinder seals, were found in a stratum dating to about 1300 Be in the Kadmeion or royal palace at Thebes.26 Most archaeologists were cautious, but this find, in a city so closely linked by tradition to Phoenicia, naturally reopened the possibility that the legends around Kadmos might contain some truth. It also provided ammunition for a radical challenge to the anti-Phoenician aspects ofthe Aryan Model.27 Then, again, in the I 960s work by art historians on the many motifs and techniques common to the Near East and the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age demonstrated close contact; while the direction ofinfluence in the earlier part ofthe period seemed to indicate that they have travelled westward.28
Interestingly, Classical and Aegean archaeologists were not overtly hostile to this work.29 On the other hand, there is no doubt that archaeological indications of Near Eastern influence in the Aegean have generally been played down. And, by contrast, the large amounts of Mycenaean pottery found in the Levant from the end of the Late Bronze Age have been widely interpreted as indicating Greek presence, if not colonization, in the region.30 While Michael Astour and some of the Semitist critics object to this, I accept that there does seem to have been considerable Greek cultural influence on the Levant in the 14th and 13th centuries. But I still think it right to draw attention to the double standards applied when scholars maintain this influence but deny that ofthe West Semites on the Aegean.3]
MYTHOLOGY
It should be emphasized that Hellenists have found evidence of contacts in material culture between the two civilizations less disturbing
[CH. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
than those in what are seen as the more fundamental areas ofmythology and language. In mythology, there were two ways of dealing with the increasing evidence of striking parallels between Near Eastern and Aegean forms, while staying in the Extreme Aryan Model. The first and most satisfactory ofthese was the 'anthropological' approach advocated by Karl Otfried Miiller and pioneered by the Cambridge Classicists of the turn of the century,James Frazer and Jane Harrison: this entailed seeing the parallels as coincidental manifestations ofthe human psyche. The similarities between Greek myths and cults and those of the Middle East could also be obscured by flooding works on the subject with parallels from allover the world.32 The other major approach was
the one mentioned on p. 365, adopted by the modern Classicists Professors Walcot and West. This consisted of attributing Oriental influence to the Indians, Iranians, Hittites, Humans and Babylonians, in descending order ofdesirability.33 A third technique, that ofthe American Classicist and mythographer Professor Fontenrose, was to combine the two and postulate both universals and borrowings over the land route.34 Yet another approach, attempting to deal with the problems posed by the close parallels seen between Greece and the West Semitic culture of Ugarit, was to postulate Greek colonies in the Syrian city and the transmission home by the colonists of Semitic myths and stories.35 In all these approaches, the trick was to explain the parallels in any way except for that set out in the Ancient Model - the Egyptian and Phoenician colonization of Greece.
LANGUAGE
Throughout this volume I have been stressing that language is the sandum sandorum of the Aryan Model. Not only is there the Romantic belief that language is the fundamental expression of the unique spirit of a people; there is also the position of language at the core of an academic discipline. Ability to use the language is the sine qua non for making any statements in the area, and it is largely through the necessarily authoritarian process oflanguage teaching that students are inculcated with the bounds of the discipline. Thus it is not surprising



BLACK ATHENA
that while there has been considerable relaxation of the ban on Near Eastern influences in the area ofmaterial culture, and some movement on mythology, when it comes to language the prohibition on fundamental Afroasiatic influences is still rigidly maintained. Here again, 'respectable' scholars attributed the irreducibly 'Oriental' items in the Greek vocabulary to Indian, Iranian, Hittite, Hurrian, Babylonian, West Semitic and Egyptian sources, in the same descending order of desirability.36
There are, however, two modem American scholars with equal facility in Greek and Hebrew, Saul Levin and John Pairman Brown, who have worked with great caution and soundness to re-establish a number ofCanaanite loans into Greek. In so far as Classicists are aware of their work, Levin's is dismissed because he maintains that there are genetic links between Semitic and Indo-European languages, a position that became anathema at the same time as the establishment ofthe Extreme Aryan Model- and for very much the same reasons.37 Brown's work, which is largely published in journals ofSemitic studies, is simply ignored.38 This is, in fact, the traditional way of dealing with such irrefutable work.
There had also been the forced recognition that the admitted loan words found in Linear B had been introduced in the Bronze Age. Despite this, the most widely acknowledged and praised work on Semitic loaning into Greek was a booklet by the French linguist E. Masson which restricted confirmed loans to words for material objects attested in the minute corpus of Phoenician inscriptions, excluding those found in Ugaritic or the Bible.39 Thus the already exiguous number of admitted loans was lessened.
UGARIT
Nevertheless, a reaction to this Aryanism was emerging. Before we come to it, however, we should briefly consider the major intemalist development weakening the Extreme Aryan Model: the discovery of Ugaritic civilization. Ugarit, a port on the Syrian coast, was excavated with great thoroughness after its discovery in 1929. Almost immediately, in the first archaeological season, large numbers of baked clay
. [CH. X] POST-WAR SITUATION
tablets were unearthed in strata dating to the 14th and 13th centuries BC. Some were in Akkadian, the lingua franca of the Late Bronze Age; others, however, were in an unknown cuneiform script. This was deciphered with great speed, for two reasons: first, because unlike other forms ofcuneiform, which are syllabic, this writing was alphabetic; and secondly, because the language was a previously unknown form ofWest Semitic very close to Canaanite. This 'new' language has been extremely valuable to linguists. Most of the texts are economic and provide precious information on the structure and trade of a major entrepot. Others concern legends and and these have been of outstanding importance because of their striking parallels to both Bible stories and Greek mythology. This causes immense problems for the Extreme Aryan Model, with its central beliefin a categorical separation between the Aryan Greeks and the Semitic Levantines.
SCHOLARSHIP AND
THE RISE OF ISRAEL
Hellenic scholarship was not direcdy affected by the foundation and military expansion of Israel, even though they provided a clear-cut demonstration that Canaanite speakers were not ipso facto incapable of conquest or the establishment of overseas colonies. The immediate effect on mostJewish historians was to narrow the focus oftheir studies to Palestine and to neglect the Diaspora. Equally, there was an increasing tendency to emphasize the distinctions rather than the similarities between the Israelites and their Canaanite and Phoenician neighbours, thus limiting extremely important comparative studies.4O The indirect impact ofthe foundation ofIsrael was critically important. It renewed Jews' pride in secular Jewishness. Furthermore, by providing two poles - the religious and the secular nationalist - it allowed more room for manoeuvre within the Jewish tradition. A few scholars were able to make use of this new scope to become independent, and in the area with which we are concerned the two most outstanding of these, Cyrus Gordon and Michael Astour, are working in America. Both men are self-consciously Jewish, but outside the



II ,I
'I
BLACK ATHENA
mainstreams of religion and Zionism. The major motive behind Gordon's work appears to be a drive for assimilation. This is not the assimilation of scholars like Reinach, who wanted Jews to conform to Christian or Hellenic culture. Gordon seems to see assimilation as a partnership in which both sides, aware and proud oftheir roots, create a richer civilization.4l Astour's views are similar, but there seems to be a stronger element of pan-Semitism in his work and a reluctance to concede any creativity to Indo-European or Egyptian speakers.
CYRUS GORDON
Cyrus Gordon is a brilliant linguist and one of the greatest living Semitists. Despite attempts by his enemies to replace it, his pioneering Ugaritic Grammar remains the standard work on the first new Semitic language to be discovered this century. Nevertheless, for the past thirty years he has been on the fringes ofacademia and most scholars consider him to be a crank. This is partly because his sins or errors are not ones of omission - towards which academia is extremely lenient - but of commission, which are considered irredeemably heinous. Moreover, his attempts to demonstrate the existence of Phoenician or even early Jewish influence on America are so far from conventional wisdom as to make him appear ludicrous. This means that all his original work can be, and has been, brushed aside with contempt.42 A much more serious and immediate threat to the academic status quo has come from Gordon's attempts to link Semitic and Greek cultures. He sees two bridges between them in Ugarit and Crete, and it was on the basis of his massive work on Ugarit that he wrote a monograph, published in 1955, which he entitled Homer and the Bible. He concluded at the end of this that 'Greek and Hebrew civilizations were parallel structures built on the same East Mediterranean foundations.' Although this was relatively similar to Evans' ideas at the beginning of the century, it was not tolerable to scholars working in the Extreme Aryan Model. As Gordon describes it, the reaction to this work was
sharp: some ofthe reviewers were lavish in their praises, while others were scornful. But this much was clear: I was no longer a sedate

scholar whom specialists accepted as another quiet specialist. I had become a disturber of the academic peace, and at the same time a scholar whose writings and lectures had become ofinterest to a wider

pu c.
Here, as with Victor Berard fifty years earlier, there was a division between lay opinion, with its 'lumper' preferences for simple and large combinations, and professional opinion with its 'splitter' ones. The professional needs narrow, unrelated topics suitable for research and 'private ownership' of knowledge. In respondmg to Berard and Gordon other specialists felt threatened, precisely because ofthe plausibility of the case made against the academic status quo. To a layperson, the idea of close connections between Homeric Greece, Ugarit and biblical Palestine seems perfectly plausible in view oftheir historical and geographical proximity, especially after the Nazis had discredited the notion that Aryans were categorically distinct and superior. For the professional, things were 'not so simple', and laymen, who had no idea ofthe details ofthe situation contained in the scholarly literature, had no right to challenge the experts. Unfortunately, however, much as academics would like it to be so - because their status and livelihood depend on it - the obvious is not always false! Sometimes it is possible to say in retrospect that members ofthe lay public have known better than the professionals: I mentioned the case ofContinental Drift in the Introduction. Crete, Gordon's second connection between the Semites and the Greeks, was still more upsetting. Excited by Ventris' decipherment of Linear B, Gordon proceeded on the assumption - criticized at the time, but, now generally conceded - that its signs had the same phonetic values as its predecessor Linear A, the linear writing system of at least later Minoan civilization.44 Following this principle, Gordon was able to read several Semitic words and discern Semitic sentence patterns in the earlier script. To do this, he assumed that as in Linear B there was little distinction made between voiced and unvoiced stops and QS; PI and QS and ks and gs). He also drew, for his vocabulary, from both West Semitic and Akkadian. Gordon published preliminary results of his reading ofLinear A in the very respectable journalAntiquiO' in 1957; in



BLACK ATHENA
the 1960s he developed his ideas on this and on Semitic readings for later Eteocretan inscriptions written in the Greek alphabet.45 The procedures he adopted were generally considered illegitimate, but they were spectacularly vindicated by the discovery in 1975 of Eblaite, a West Semitic language of the 3rd millennium BC. Eblaite combines Akkadian archaisms with features found in Ugaritic and Canaanite.46 Gordon's work on Homeric and biblical parallels, like his work on Linear A, has been considered 'controversial'. Interestingly, however, Gordon received immediate support from two white 'English' South African scholars and this, I believe, can be explained by externalist or ideological forces. Whereas after 1885 most Northern Europeans and Americans felt free to indulge in anti-Semitism, the Afrikaners, because of their fundamentalist tradition, felt both love and hate towards theJews.47 The combination turned to anti-Semitism with the systematization of their racism and their alliance with the German Nazis.48 On the other hand, 'English' South Africans could never neglect the threat of non-Europe, and they preserved the 19th-century ambivalence towards the Jews. Furthermore, they had a specific need to explain away the massive stone ruins of Zimbabwe, after which the country is now named. Even before the carbon dating ofthese remains in the 1960s to the 15th and 16th centuries, it was pretty clear that they had been built by the Shona people, who still live in the region. Such a conclusion was impossible, however, because racial stereotypes forbade Africans to carry out such undertakings; so the buildings were attributed to the Phoenicians.49 Thus in Southern Africa the positive feelings of the Victorian period towards the Phoenicians had been preserved, and would seem to be a factor in the open-mindedness of South African Classicists on this issue.
However, both scholars withdrew their support and took more orthodox positions on Linear A in favour of agnosticism and Anatolian connections. The change must be seen in the light of the harsh reactions against a Semitic connection among European Hellenists, notably from Ventris' collaboratorJohn Chadwick, the doyen ofMyce. naean linguistic studies. In neither his article on Linear B for the Cambridge Ancient History, nor his massive Documents in Mycenaean Greek, does Chadwick make any mention of Gordon's work on Linear
[CH. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
A, much of which is published in standard journals. Interestingly, Chadwick specifically claims that omission from his bibliography 'must not be construed as criticism'. Nevertheless the importance of Gordon's hypothesis - not only to the interpretation of Linear A but also to the nature of Mycenaean script, language and society - makes the failure to refer to it very significant.50 So far at least, Gordon has suffered the fate of many radicals. Even now that the Extreme Aryan Model, against which Gordon had offended in the 1950s, is beginning to crumble; and although it is now acknowledged that Linear A can be read with the sound values of '\ Linear B; that 'mixed' Semitic languages have existed; that there are Semitic words in Linear A and Eteocretan, and that there is no inherent reason why they should not be Semitic; it is still denied that they are Semitic and that Gordon deserves any credit for having suggested
thiS.51 Although Cyrus Gordon is in many ways an academic pariah, his language and teaching skills have meant that his pupils are the best equipped of their generation, and they have now become a major force in American Semitic studies. One of the lessons they have learnt is the high cost of stepping out of line, and only one of them has published on Crete.52 Nevertheless, most retain a basic sympathy with his views and the conviction that the role of Canaanites and Phoenicians has been systematically neglected.53 There is no doubt that their influence is sapping the academic status quo, and in the United States is leading to a refusal to accept the previously unquestioned dominance of Classics over Semitic studies.
ASTOUR AND HELLENOSEMITlCA
In the short run, however, Gordon's colleague Michael Astour has had a much greater impact. Astour was in Paris in the I 930s, where he was a student of the French decipherer of Ugaritic, Charles Virolleaud; Virolleaud had been influenced by Berard and privately believed in the basic truth of the Phoenician references in the Kadmeian myths. From 1939 to 1950 Astour was in Soviet prison camps; he spent the next six years in a Siberian city, where he was able, in his free time and



420 BLACK ATHENA
overcoming great difficulties, to continue research on Greek - Semitic relations. In 1956 he left the Soviet Union for Poland and there, a year later, he read Gordon's first article on Linear A. Soon after this he went to the United States, where he was given a post by Gordon in the latter's department at the great Jewish university of Brandeis.54 In 1967 he published Hellenosemitica, a book containing major studies on the myth cycles of Danaos, Kadmos and what he called the 'healer heroes', who included Jason and Bellerophon. In these he tried to show detailed similarities between Greek, Ugaritic and biblical myths in both structure and nomenclature, and here he followed and went beyond the work of Berard. As I have mentioned, other scholars during the late 1950S and the early 1960s, like Fontenrose and Walcot, had traced detailed parallels between Greek and Near Eastern mythology, never doubting that the Greek forms were derivative.55 Why was Astour's work considered so much more offensive? First, it offended at a formal level, because it challenged the academic hierarchy; this was a reflection of the relative power of the two disciplines. Although Classicists had previously discussed Eastern parallels to Hellenic mythology, it was entirely different and unacceptable for Orientalists to pronounce on Greece. There were also fundamental objections to the content of Astour's work. Scholars like Fontenrose and Walcot had made broad sweeps of world mythology - including India, Iran and so on - and they gave preference, if possible, to the less offensive sources. By contrast, Astour's derivation of Greek names from Semitic not only poached on the sacred ground oflanguage, but also made the connections between West Semites and Greeks disturbingly close and specific. Furthermore, two ofthe myth cycles he treated - those ofKadmos and Danaos - were concerned with Near Eastern colonization in Greece, and he made a plausible case for their having a historical kernel of truth. The fourth section ofHellenosemitica was even more provocative in that it went into the sociology ofknowledge, and its sketch ofthe history and ideology of Classics and Classical archaeology has been the basis of all later writings on this subject, this volume included. In doing this Astour injected relativism into subjects that had previously been impervious to
[CH. X] POST-WAR SITUATION 421
the forces of probabilism and uncertainty that have transformed other disciplines since the 1890S. Astour has proved - pace Ruth Edwards et al. - that there were fundamental links between West Semitic and Greek mythology.56 But this is clearly only part ofhis aim. Like Movers and the other mid- I 9thcentury scholars who maintained the Broad Aryan Model, Astour believes that the Ancient Model's picture ofcolonization is substantially correct, except that the latter attributed to the Egyptians what were essentially West Semitic conquests. In general he maintained that 'Not only was Phoenician spoken in several parts ofMycenaean Greece, but the entire Mycenaean civilization was essentially a peripheral culture of the Ancient East, its westernmost extension.,57
Although he pointed out the presence of the loan words in Linear B, proving significant Semitic influence before the 14th century Be, Astour did not look for any further examples at other stages in the development ofGreek. Moreover, he never considered the possibilities of Egyptian cultural influence; or of a general Near Eastern influx capable of explaining most of the non-Indo-European elements in the Greek language, toponyms and mythological nomenclature which would thus do away with the need for the hypothetical substratum ofthe Pre-Hellenes. Nevertheless, Astour has permanently changed the historiography ofthe ancient Mediterranean. Hellenosemitica has sold exceptionally well. The reviews, however, were so hostile that Astour has given up work on the subject. The critics were led by one of the few scholars with the necessary skills to debate him - J. D. Muhly, an American archaeologist with a knowledge ofboth Greek and Akkadian. Muhly claimed that 'Hellenosemitica is a profound disappointment. Instead of a fresh treatment of the problem, based upon the wealth of new material, the reader is served with a rechauffage of the theories of Victor Berard.,58 According to Muhly, Astour had proved nothing about Greek relations with the Levant during the Bronze Age. Muhly also claimed that in attacking the anti-Phoenician excesses of scholars like Beloch in the 1890S, Astour was setting up a straw man whose views were unlike those of modem Classicists. However, the force of this argument was weakened by another of Muhly's statements: 'I do not propose to defend the absurdities which



I
422 BLACK ATHENA
have been published and are still being published about Near Eastern Civilization by eminent Classicists' (myemphasis).59
Muhly's second statement should be allowed to stand, because Beloch is still widely respected in some quarters of his discipline and because there is very little to choose between his anti-Phoenicianism in the 1890S and that of Rhys Carpenter in the 1950s.60 Muhly was undoubtedly right, on the other hand, to point out that the majority of modern Classicists do not share the racism and anti-Semitism endemic among their teachers or their teachers' teachers. But he was still asking his readers to swallow the implausible idea that the Extreme Aryan Model grew up pure and uncontaminated by the Zeitgeist in which it was formed or the views - which would now be considered unacceptable ofthose who created it.
Three years later, in 1970, Muhly returned to the attack in an article entitled 'Homer and the Phoenicians'. In this he argued along the lines ofthe conventional wisdom that has been outlined earlier in this chapter - that there was no archaeological proof of Phoenician presence in the Mediterranean before the 8th century, and that Levantine objects found in Bronze Age levels there had been brought by Greeks through mercenary service, trade or even as tourists' bric-a.-brac. He asserted that Homer's Phoenicians were those of Homer's own period, which Muhly saw as the 8th century; they were not contemporary with the Trojan War or the Late Mycenaean period. Muhly was clearly and passionately maintaining the arguments ofBeloch and Rhys Carpenter that Phoenician influence on Greece was late and shalloW.61 We shall return later to Muhly's partial change ofheart in the 1980s.
ASTOUR'S SUCCESSOR?
J. C. BILLIGMEIER
Although Astour did not have much immediate impact on Classics, his work did elicit some response among ancient historians. In 1976 a short PhD thesis by]. C. Billigmeier, entitled Kadmos and the Possibility of a Semitic Presence in Helladic Greece, was approved at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In fact the thesis was more daring than its title suggests, for not only did it accept Astour's work on the Kadmeian
[CH. X] ,THE POST-WAR SITUATION
and Danaan legends but it went beyond him to consider, favourably, the traditions of Danaos' Egyptian origin. Billigmeier also reiterated a number ofthe accepted Semitic etymologies for Greek words and place names and revived several ofthose that had been discarded in the 19th
62
century. Seven years later, in 1983, it was announced that a small Dutch publisher was going to bring out Billigmeier's work as a book. However, the promised book was withdrawn at the last moment and it has not appeared since. Without knowing the specifics ofthe case, it is impossible to say anything definitive - on the other hand, the sequence would appear to fit a general pattern by which publishers are 'discouraged' from publishing books advocating this particular academic heresy.63 Saul Levin, for instance, wrote:
The search for a willing publisher proved to be slower than the actual research had been, and as disagreeable as the research had been exhilarating. Experience taught me to wait for a year or more for nothing better than a letter of rejection with a brief explanation or none.64
This is a good description of my own experience too, while Cyrus Gordon has published all his later books with a small press owned by a family member. Ruth Edwards, whom I come to next, thanks her publisher 'for accepting this work for publication at what proved to be a difficult time,.65 This pattern shows the way in which control of university presses, and major influence over the commercial ones, allows academics supporting the status quo to 'maintain standards' - as they would express it - or, in other words, to repress opposition to orthodoxy.
AN ATTEMPT AT COMPROMISE:
RUTH EDWARDS
No Classicist has felt it worthwhile - or perhaps been able? - to make a full-scale defence of their position against the challenge coming from Gordon and Astour. On the other hand, one scholar has tried to establish a compromise by which the positive aspects of the Semitists'



BLACK ATHENA
work could be incorporated into 'respectable' scholarship. This was Dr Ruth Edwards, a pupil of Dr Stubbings, who was mentioned on p. 410 for his belief in the Hyksos conquests. Ruth Edwards' thesis was completed in 1968, but her book only appeared over ten years later. Her work Kadmos the Phoenician is of central importance to the topics with which we are concerned. Her attitude to Astour is critical. She savagely attacks his linkages through mythological parallels because, she argues, many are loose; based on dubious readings of Ugaritic texts; come from different periods; or are simply the result of common folkloric motifs.66 She is also sceptical about his etymologies, because of the laxity that is inevitable when dealing with purely consonantal West Semitic alphabets. On the other hand, she is equally scathing about the source-critics' denial of the antiquity of the Kadmeian and Danaan legends: as no early Greek writer attacked them, she points out, the source-critics had to rely on the dubious 'argument from silence'. She goes on to prove that the legends ofPhoenician colonization are indeed veryold.67 In general Dr Edwards maintains that all legends should be treated with extreme caution and that, as far as possible, common folkloric motifs should be factored out. But she is convinced that the legends about Kadmos and Danaos contain genuine Mycenaean elements and, moreover, she follows Astour in his argument that evidence from legends is no more subjective than that from other sources. As she puts it:
It is sometimes assumed by those who urge us to disregard legend and concentrate on these other sources that they are in some way more objeaive than the traditions. But we must emphasize that archaeology, language and documents are objective only within a very restricted compass, in fact only so long as they are concerned with mere observation and description of data. Once they aspire to interpretation, a subjective element enters in. This is particularly worth illustrating in regard to archaeology: the same assemblage of artefacts, the very same destruction levels, may be interpreted in different ways by different archaeologists. There is, moreover, a
[CH.X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
tendency for archaeological interpretations to run in fashions. Thus in British prehistory it was customary in the first part ofthis century for certain changes in material culture to be explained by invasion; today this view is generally rejected in favour ofexplanations through indigenous development. Similarly in Greek prehistory we can see how up to the 1890S there was a tendency to interpret many Bronze Age achievements as the work of Phoenicians or other Orientals ... how shortly afterwards the Cretan hypothesis became almost universally accepted, and how at the present time the independence of Mainland Greece is generally stressed. The other sources, then, are not in themselves objective for the purpose ofreconstruaing prehistory; they are subject to limitations of precisely the same order as the legendary tradition. The prehistorian is always working from imperfect and ambiguous material and there is . . . nothing basically
illogical or unsound about using legendary evidence, provided one . h . d' 68
recognIZes w at one IS omg.
Thus, while she accepts that there is a historical kernel to the Kadmeian legends - and, by implication, to the Danaan ones too - Dr Edwards is uncertain whether they refer to a 16th-century Hyksos colonization or to a 14th-century trading settlement. She also believes that the legends allow for a Kadmeian foundation at Thebes coming from either Crete or the Near East, and prefers the latter.69 But following her teacher, Dr Stubbings, and the 'Thirlwall tradition' that 'while there may have been Semitic invasions, it did not make any difference' - she makes it clear that the only thing about which she is nearly certain is that there was no large-scale migration to Greece:
If settlement on a large scale from the Orient had occurred in Mycenaean Greece, one would expect either more specific traces of it in the archaeological record, or some record of it in the Oriental documents. But evidence ofthis sort is lacking, and no good support is given by linguistic material, since (pace Astour) the Semitisms which occur in Greek are comparatively few and explicable as loan
words.7o



BLACK ATHENA
One should note here the use of 'the argument from silence' for archaeology and the circularity of the linguistic argument, which runs something like: 'It is pointless looking for Near Eastern etymologies for Greek words because there is no evidence of sustained contacts between the two cultures. As there are so few loan words, there cannot have been significant contacts ...'
Nevertheless, despite her caution and her desire to keep them at arm's length, there is no doubt that Ruth Edwards has been profoundly influenced by the work of Gordon and Astour. It is striking that' Billigmeier, who was completely unaware of her thesis, should have worked along such similar lines. Taken together, they indicate to me that the Extreme Aryan Model is crumbling. Edwards and Billigmeier both accepted without question that contemporary anti-Semitism had affected historical writing about the Phoenicians. Futhermore - and here Edwards was also following her teacher, Dr Stubbings - both maintained that legends were a legitimate source of information about prehistory.
THE RETURN OF THE
IRON AGE PHOENICIANS
While Astour and his successors have been reviving the Bronze Age Phoenicians or Canaanites, there have also been moves to reinstate the Phoenicians in the Early Iron Age Aegean. The Belgian Classicist O. Van Berchem's articles on 'The sanctuaries of Hercules-Melqart: contributions to the study of the Phoenician expansion in the Mediterranean', published in 1967, showed the extent, depth and high dating of Phoenician influence in the Mediterranean in the early 1St millennium BC.71 Then, in 1979, a major work on Phoenician expansion by another Belgian scholar, Guy Bunnens, appeared. In this the author combined the Francophone philo-Phoenician tradition of Berard with the academic self-consciousness ofthe 1960s and Astour's political analysis of Classics.72 By 1980 even Muhly's bailiwick, the University of Pennsylvania, had been infected. A thesis by one of his students, P. R. Helm, lists the considerable amount of recent archaeological evidence suggesting a
[CH. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
Phoenician presence in the Aegean as early as the lOth century BC. And in a paragraph which shows signs of the difficulties involved when a student comes to conclusions that run counter to the strongly held views
ofhis professor, he writes:
All ofthis is not to suggest that the theory ofaNear Eastern maritime monopoly - rejected as a model for Aegean-Oriental commerce in the Late Bronze Age - should be revived to describe conditions in the Early Iron Age. Nor is it proposed to resurrect the 'days when scholars saw Phoenician traders everywhere in the 8th-century Aegean, bringing their goods to Greece and instructing the Greeks in the higher arts ofcivilization', even if Phoenician traders are now to be dubbed 'Cypro-Phoenicians'. There is abundant evidence to demonstrate that Athens and the other Greek states regularly engaged in maritime enterprises at this period. What is suggested is that the Oriental trade was largely, if not exclusively, in the hands of merchants from Cyprus (and probably the Levantine coasts as well) [elsewhere he writes that Cypriot wares were 'actually ofPhoenician origin'] who traded regularly with the South-Eastern Aegean and occasionally with the Cyclades, Euboea andAttica. (my emphasis)73
Now, in the mid-198os, Muhly himself is shifting ground. In a paper published in 1984 - and apparently overwhelmed by the archaeological evidence - he sees massive West Semitic influence on Mycenaean Greece.74 However, despite this volte-face and Helm's conclusions, he remains obdurate on the issue of Phoenicians in the Aegean during the Early Iron Age.75
NAVEH AND THE TRANSMISSION
OF THE ALPHABET
It is not surprising that the 'revolt' of the Semitists has been most successful at the weak point of the Aryan Model, the alphabet; for we have seen how the attacks on the Extreme Model of the 1950S and 60S were clearly linked to the rise of Jewish self-confidence after the establishment of Israel. Moreover, on the alphabet the challenge came from Israel itself. During the 1940s, the Semitist and epigrapher



BLACK ATHENA
Professor Tur-Sinai at Jerusalem had continued to oppose Rhys Carpenter's ultra-low dating; then in 1973 a new start came with a path-breaking article by an archaeologist turned epigrapher, Joseph Naveh, entitled 'Some Semitic epigraphical considerations of the Greek alphabet'.76 Working purely from epigraphy, Naveh argued that the uncertain direction of the early Greek inscriptions resembled not the regular right to left ofthe Phoenician alphabet, but the irregularities of the Canaanite one that had preceded it. Similarly, the stances of a number ofGreek letters, notably A and were not those ofPhoenician but paralleled those ofthe earlier period. Naveh further maintained that the early Greek Hand 0 were identical to the Canaanite, not the Phoenician, forms and that .1,E,N,2,ll, Q,P and possibly El, though not identical to the earlier Semitic shapes, could be much more plausibly derived from the Late Canaanite forms than from the Phoenician ones.77 Naveh could see that his scheme faced difficulties over K and M, the earliest examples ofwhich seemed to resemble Phoenician forms from around B50 BC rather than the earlier ones. He had rather cumbersome explanations for these, and despite the complications was convinced that the older letters and the bulk of the evidence pointed conclusively to a date from before the standardization ofthe Phoenician alphabet. As he - wrongly, in my opinion - accepted Albright's low dating of the A1)iram inscription of just after 1000 BC, according to the validity of'the argument from silence' he cautiously postulated this date as the time of standardization, and put the date of transmission fifty years earlier, at about 1050.78
Naveh's article appeared in The American Journal ofArchaeology, in which Carpenter and Ullman had published their pieces. Even so, as so often happens with fundamental challenges to academic orthodoxies, his argument met with almost no response. Rhys Carpenter's leading successor, the Oxford Classicist and specialist in early Greek alphabets Dr L. Jeffery, limited her criticisms to short comments of the type: 'Naveh, an article deserving serious attention by Greek epigraphers, though the blank on the Greek side before the Bth century remains a problem (and his argument is wrong in assuming that the tailless forms of mu and psi are early).' 79 On the whole, she and her colleagues have
[CH. X] THE POST-WAR SITUATION
continued to base themselves on 'the fundamental work of Rhys Carpenter'; though now, since the discovery of datable Greek inscriptions from the Bth century, they tend to think in terms of around Boo rather than 700 BC.80 Incidentally, this concession removes one of the main props of Carpenter's argument - the need for the Assyrians to propel the Phoenicians westward. It also takes away one of his main motivations to show that Phoenician influence came after the formation
ofthe Greek polis. The situation has been rather different among Semitists. The biblical scholar and epigrapher Professor Kyle McCarter, a pupil and colleague of the great Albright's successor, Professor Frank Cross, the leading Semitic epigrapher at Harvard, tried to find a compromise between Naveh and Carpenter, concluding with the uncertain
declaration:
While the Greeks may have begun to experiment with Phoenician writing as early as the II th century BC, they did not, for whatever reason, develop a true independent tradition until the beginning of the Bth century. The Greek system, therefore, is best described as descended from a Phoenician prototype of
c.Boo BC ...81
I believe that Professor McCarter is right to stress two periods of borrowing. Where he is transparently misleading, however, is in his protestations of orthodoxy and his apparent acceptance of Carpenter. McCarter did, in fact, concede Naveh's argument - for what can an alphabetic 'experiment' be, if not an earlier borrowing of an alphabet? On the other hand, McCarter's dilemma has been a general one, and many Semitists have increasingly blurred their dating of the transmission, putting it somewhere between 1100 and
750 BC.82 Other Semitists, however, have been moving towards a higher date. Professor Cross is becoming increasingly assertive towards the Classicists. As he put it in 1975, beautifully demonstrating the integral relationship between the low dating of the alphabetic transmission and the Extreme Aryan Model:



43 0 BLACK ATHENA
From the standpoint of the Orientalist, certain standard arguments ofthe Classicists for a late date ofborrowing no longer carry weight: (I) The argument that the Phoenicians were not in the west until the Bth century or later is simply wrong, a classic instance ofthe fallacy of argumentum e silentio. The Phoenicians were in contact with the islands and shores ofthe West Mediterranean from the I Ith century on ...
(2) The theory of the prolonged Dark Age of Greek illiteracy appears to be crumbling . " To the Orientalist this theory ... appears most precarious ...
(3) The widely held view that the Greek script was borrowed immediately before the earliest extant Greek inscriptions (now dated to the second halfofthe Bth century BC) is wrong ... We must posit a considerable time-span between the time the script was borrowed and its appearance in the earliest known Greek inscriptions to explain the distance between the earliest Greek scripts and any point in the sequence of the Proto-Canaanite and Linear Phoenician script types . . .
(4) No theory of the Greek script will long stand which does not offer an adequate explanation of archaic features (i.e., typologically old) in the alphabet of Crete, Thera and Melos. I am strongly inclined to believe that Phoenicians in the West rather than Greeks
in the East were the primary agents in the initial spread of the alphabet. 83
Professor Cross's convictions have been still further strengthened by recent discoveries in Israel; notably of a I abecedarium or complete alphabet found at the village ofIzbet Sartah outside Tel Aviv, the letters ofwhich look far more like those of Greek and Roman than the later Phoenician ones.84
However, there are still Semitic epigraphers who are frightened by such boldness and they have leapt with some glee upon the recent discovery of an inscription at Tell Fekheriye, some 200 kilometres inland on the Syrian-Turkish border. Because the letters of this inscription - which has tentatively been dated on non-epigraphic grounds to the mid-9th century - have many 'pre-Phoenician' features,
[CH. X] .THE POST-WAR SITUATION 43 1
it has been argued that the archaic characteristics found in the early Greek alphabet could have been transmitted at a much later date.85 But even these scholars admit that the Levantine coast and its immediate hinterland were writing with standard Phoenician letters by the 9th century. Thus for an alphabet of the Tell Fekheriye type to have reached Greece would have required a leapfrog over Phoenicia, the richest and most prestigious region in the Near East of the time. The implausibility of such an argument only underlines the power of conservatism and the vested interests involved. Despite this eddy, however, there is no doubt that the general trend for the date of the transmission is now upward, and dates of the lOth century are now relatively common even from those who claim to be opposed to Naveh.86 There have even been attempts to raise the date beyond the 11th century. In 19BI, Gordon's pupil Robert Stieglitz published an article which argued that Naveh had been too minimalist in assuming that the alphabet had been transmitted only at the last possible date before the formation of the Phoenician alphabet. In any event, Stieglitz showed that evidence from late Ugaritic writing indicated the presence of a Phoenician alphabet ofthe 22-letter type on the Levant by 1400 BC. Furthermore, he demonstrated that there were strong Greek traditions pointing to their having had an alphabet before the Trojan War. Thus he maintained that the alphabet had been transmitted through a Semitic-speaking Eteocretan population in Crete in the 14th century.87 In 1983 I proposed a still earlier date for the transmission, based on a new find at Kiimid el Loz, in the Bek<a valley in Lebanon, that firmly placed the so-called South Semitic Alphabet in the 14th century BC.88 Inscriptions in the South Semitic scripts, of which the Ethiopian alphabets are the sole survivors today, occur throughout the Arabian and Syrian deserts. One of their most significant differences from the 22-letter Canaanite alphabet and its descendants - which include Phoenician, Aramaic and Aramaic's derivative, the modem Arabic alphabet - is that the South Semitic scripts have up to 30 letters for all the consonants of Arabic and Proto-Semitic. Indeed, the German Semitists and epigraphers Professors Rollig and Mansfeld have plausibly argued, on the basis ofthe find at Kiimid eI Loz, that the Canaanite



43 2 BLACK ATHENA
alphabet was derived from an earlier one of the South Semitic type.B9
In 1902 the German Semitist Praetorius pointed out the striking visual and phonetic correspondences between letters from Thamudic and Safaitic - two of the most archaic South Semitic alphabets, but not present in Canaanite - and the so-called 'new letters' c;I> X lp
,, ,
and Q at the end of the Greek alphabet. These occur in many of the earliest Greek inscriptions, but no origin for them has been discovered. Praetorius went on to argue that these letters were derived from an earlier alphabet of the South Semitic type. Although a number of scholars, including Sir Arthur Evans and the great French Semitist Rene Dussaud, acknowledged the similarities, the hypothesis was dropped in the 1920S and 30s.90 The reasons for this seem to have been the incompatibility of these ideas with the Extreme Aryan Model and the archaeological positivism of these decades, which led scholars to demand proofofthe early existence ofthe South Semitic alphabets. Now that there is early attestation, I believe the time is ripe to reopen the debate. I have proposed that the Anatolian, Aegean and other alphabets - and alphabetically derived syllabaries from around the Mediterranean - originate from one in use in the Levant from before the development of the 22-letter Canaanite one in the Phoenician cities in the 15th or 14th century Be.91 To accept this would merely return us to the Ancient Model; to the position of Herodotos and the other ancient writers - with the exception of)osephus - who argued that the alphabet had been introduced to Greece by Kadmos or Danaos, sometime in the middle of the 2nd millennium Be. This return would also destroy the concept of an illiterate Dark Age; while the survival of alphabetic literacy from before the Trojan War would in turn strengthen confidence in the reliability of the Classical Greeks' reports of their Bronze Age past - notably the traditions ofcolonization. The assault on the low dating of the transmission of the Semitic alphabet to Greece is only one aspect of the general attack on the Extreme Aryan Model as a whole. There is no doubt that with the tergiversation of Professor Muhly, the active heart of opposition to an early West Semitic presence in the Aegean has collapsed. This is not to say, however, that there is not still considerable inertia working for the
[CH. X] 'f.HE POST-WAR SITUATION 433
maintenance ofthe Extreme Aryan Model. It is striking, in this context, that the latest edition ofthe CambridgeAncientHistory, Volume 3, Part 1 _TheMiddleEastandtheAegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries Be-has chapters on Assyria, Babylonia, Urartu, the Neo-Hittite states of Syria and Anatolia, Israel and Judah, Cyprus and Egypt - but none on Phoenicia, which was the dominant power in the Mediterranean ofthe
time.
However, although this volume was published in 1982, its planning represents scholarship from well before the rethinking that began in the late 1970s. The bibliography on Eastern influences on Greece, for instance, compiled by the Oxford Classicist Oswyn Murray in 1980 shows how pathetically little work has been done on this crucial subject. And, as one would expect, most authors refer loosely to Babylonia and prefer the 'land bridge', thus avoiding Phoenicia. Murray himself represents the trend away from the Extreme Aryan Model, and seems much more open on the subject of Phoenician influence. However, even he dates that influence to the period after 750 Be; whereas both . the heyday of Phoenicia, and the apparent Greek adoption of such Phoenician institutions as the city-state and colonization, came before
that.
THE RETURN OF THE EGYPTIANS?
Whether or not these ideas, or those ofNaveh and Cross, are accepted, the fact that they are being debated means that the paradigmatic monopoly of the Extreme Aryan Model has been shattered. I believe, therefore, that despite the conservative tide and revived racism of the 1980s, the attack on the Extreme Aryan Model is likely to succeed relatively quickly. The battle to restore the Ancient Model and the position of the Egyptians, on the other hand, will take rather longer. Indeed, the only accepted academic to back the claims that there had been Egyptian colonies, and significant later borrowings from Greeks studying in Egypt, has been the East German Egyptologist Siegfried Morenz. Morenz, a recognized and extremely productive scholar who is best known for his works on Egyptian religion, published in 1969 a very important work on Europe's Encounter with Egypt.



434 BLACK ATHENA
This work covers several of the areas approached in this volume. However, it fundamentally differs from Black Athena in a number of important ways: it does not set up a scheme comparable to the Ancient and Aryan Models; and it specifically rejects spelling out a sociology of knowledge, though the author is apparently aware ofsome ofthe forces
involved.93 Furthermore, Morenz does not consider the possibility of significant linguistic borrowing; nor does he mention Greek borrowings from West Semitic culture. Nevertheless, he does maintain that there was significant cultural contact between Greece and Egypt, especially through Crete.94 He also explicitly claims that the legends around Danaos contain 'a historical kernel,.95 He insisted that 'the Greeks did not only learn about the Egyptian gods in Egypt (for example as craftsmen and merchants in Naukratis) [a Greek colony established in Egypt in the 6th century] but also early in their own territory.,96 He is also convinced that Plato studied in Egypt and that he had learnt from the experience.97
Given the social, intellectual and academic forces involved, it is not surprising that Professor Morenz's powerful combination of boldness and detailed scholarship has had so little response. The work was written in conjunction with Swiss scholars, and has been published in the West. Nevertheless, it does not seem to have had a major impact on the mainstream of West German Egyptology as represented by Professor HeIck, the intellectually and academically powerful specialist in Ancient Egypt's relations with the outside world. This work of Morenz has not been translated into English or French, and as far as I am aware it is scarcely known outside German-speakingMitteleuropa. Europe's Encounter with Egypt has had no effect whatsoever on the only other group of scholars who believe that Egypt had a major cultural influence on Greece: black Americans. While the - mainly Jewish Semitists fought against the Extreme Aryan Model from the fringes of academia, the American champions of the Egyptians, who are largely Blacks, have challenged the Aryan Model from outside the system altogether.
A very small number of black academics, notably Frank Snowden, the leading professor in the field at the chiefblack university, Howard, have been successful within Classics. They have concentrated
[CH. X] 'THE POST-WAR SITUATION 435
on gleaning what little credit the Aryan model allows to Blacks while accepting both its prohibitions: the non-acceptance of a black component of Egyptian culture, and the denial of the Afroasiatic formative elements in Greek civilization.98 Other scholars, more keenly aware of the degree to which racism has pervaded every nook and cranny of I9th- and 20th-century European and North American culture, have been more sensitive. The pioneer in this effort was George G. M. James, a professor teaching at a small college in Arkansas. In 1954 he published a book entitled Stolen Legacy: The Greeks were not the authors of Greek Philosophy, but the people ofNorth Africa, commonly called the Egyptians. Stolen Legacy was not concerned with the Bronze Age foundations of Greece but, relying heavily on ancient sources, showed the extent to which the Greeks admitted they had borrowed their learning from the Egyptians during the Iron Age.99 In a rather looser way James claimed that the Egyptians had been Blacks, and the work ended with a moving appeal calling for a change in black consciousness:
It really signifies a mental emancipation, in which the black people will be liberated from the chain of traditional falsehood, which for centuries incarcerated them in a prison of inferiority complex and world humiliation and insult. (his emphasis)l00
I had to try twice to have a copy of Stolen Legacy accepted by the university library at Cornell before it was finally placed in a smaller branch library. It is not recognized as a proper book. Nor has it been read outside the black community. 101 Within intellectual circles in this community, however, it is highly prized and very influential. Stolen Legacy is generally linked in people's minds to the school of thought pioneered by the late Senegalese nuclear physicist Cheikh Anta Diop. Diop wrote prolifically on what he saw as the integral relationship between black Africa and Egypt, and in the course of this generally assumed the Ancient Model of Greek history and James' theories in Stolen Legacy to be true. However, what most concerned him was the great achievements of Egyptian civilization; the systematic denigration of them by European scholars; and his faith that the Egyptians were, as Herodotos had specified, black. 102



BLACK ATHENA
In an interesting analytical essay, the contemporary black scholar Jacob Carruthers has divided black scholars on this subject into three schools. The first are 'the old scrappers', who
without any special training, but with a sincere dedication to ferreting out the truth about the black past and destroying the big lie of black historical and cultural inferiority, took whatever data were
available and squeezed enough truth from them as circumstances allowed. 103
The second group, which includes George Washington Williams,
W. E. B. Dubois, John Hope Franklin, Anthony Noguera and Ali Mazrui, have
argued only that Blacks had a share in building the Egyptian civilization along with other races. This strain . . . is completely enthralled to European historiography ... also demand a black share in Greek Antiquity which properly understood is true, but for the
most part these 'Negro Intellectuals' have no grasp of the true meaning. 104
Carruthers sees the third group as an extension of the 'old scrappers'. They include Diop, BenJochannan and Chancellor Williams. He sees these as having'developed the multidisciplinary skills to take command of the facts of the African past which is a necessary element for the foundation of an African historiography ...,105
There is no doubt, however, that the time for the 'old scrappers' is past and that most Blacks will not be able to accept the conformity to white scholarship of men and women like Professor Snowden. However, despite calls for unity, made necessary by the embattled position of black intellectuals, I suspect that the battle between Carruthers' second and third groups will continue for a long time.
Thus, at the end of the I980s, I see continued struggle among black scholars on the question ofthe 'racial' nature ofthe Ancient Egyptians. On the other hand, there is no serious division among them on the question of the high quality of Egyptian civilization and of its central role in the formation of Greece. Furthermore, there is a general hostility among them to Semitic culture, especially when it is supposed
[CH. X] ;rHE POST-WAR SITUATION 437
to have affected Egypt. Meanwhile, where white scholars - with the exception of Morenz - are increasingly prepared to admit that West Semites played a substantial part in the creation ofGreek culture, there is still a far greater reluctance to admit fundamental Egyptian influence upon it. 106 One aspect of my work is an attempt to reconcile these two
hostile approaches.
THE REVISED ANCIENT MODEL
Interestingly, I find it easier to place myself and my promotion of the Revised Ancient Model in the spectrum of black scholarship than within the academic orthodoxy. I see myself in Carruthers' second class, whom he damns as 'Negro intellectuals'. I am happy to be in the excellent company ofDubois, Mazrui and the others who, while they do not picture all Ancient Egyptians as resembling today's West Africans, do see Egypt as essentially African. This is an indication of the isolation within academia of the ideas which form the background to this volume. However, I believe that the outrage the Revised Ancient Model causes among Classicists and some ancient historians today is a temporary phenomenon. Why do I think so? First, I believe that the disintegration ofthe Extreme Aryan Model and the introduction of externalism and relativism into ancient history are having generally subversive effects on the status quo as a whole. However, the fundamental reason I am convinced that the Revised Ancient Model will succeed in the relatively near future is simply that within liberal academic circles the political and intellectual underpinnings of the Aryan Model have largely disappeared. Since the I940S both racism and anti-Semitism have lost their respectability with the 'racial' and 'anti-Semitic' policies of Nazi Germany. Since then anti-Semitism has had to become more complicated and subterranean. Racism, too, has had to become more devious since the emergence of the Third World. Equally important have been the liberal loss of faith in the mystique 'science' and the deep suspicion of positivism since the 1960s. Thus - except possibly in the field of language - the Extreme Aryan Model's claim to be proven scientifically by experts no longer suffices to protect it from common sense.

BLACK ATHENA
As I have gone on with my research, people outside the fields concerned have frequently told me that they find my historical schemes more convincing than those provided by the academic Establishment. They cannot see why the colonizations reported by tradition should be so improbable; why the Greek language should not be treated like any other language and why it should not have been heavily influenced by Egyptian and West Semitic; why the Greeks should not have taken their religion from Egypt, as Herodotos and other Ancient Greeks maintained, or why Greek scientists and philosophers should not have learnt much of their science and philosophy in Egypt? In short, the racist and scientistic raisons d'etre ofthe Aryan Model no longer provide respect
able props. Without them, it will fall. This, however, is a matter for the Conclusion.
CONCLUSION
I
T IS ABSURD to try to summarize this book in a dozen paragraphs, when even the previous hundreds of pages in which I have attempted to set out some of the complications of this vast and extraordinarily ramified theme can best be described by the Chinese expression 'looking at flowers from horseback'. In the Introduction I set out the general way in which I see Western Asian and Northern African history over the past 10,000 years, and - in some more detail - my vision of cultural exchanges across the East Mediterranean in the 2nd millennium Be. In this conclusion, I want to concentrate on the theme ofVolume I, The Fabrication ofAncient Greece; which is the change in the models through which the origins of Greek civilization have been perceived. Before I go any further, however, I should like to repeat that the Ancient and Aryan Models are not necessarily incompatible. Indeed, while the Revised Ancient Model which I propose is, as its name states, a form of the Ancient Model, it accepts a number of features from the Aryan one, including the central belief that at some time a significant number of Indo-European speakers came into Greece from the north. On the other hand, there is no doubt that in practice there has been considerable rivalry between the two models, and it is this that I have tried to investigate here.



440 BLACK ATHENA
main body of the book began with a description of the ways in which Classical, Hellenistic and later pagan Greeks from the 5th century Be to the 5th century AD saw their distant past. I attempted to trace their own vision of their ancestors' having been civilized by Egyptian and Phoenician colonization and the later influence of Greek study in Egypt. I tried to show the ambivalent relationship between Christianity and the Jewish biblical tradition on the one hand and Egyptian religion and philosophy on the other: despite all the centuries ofpotential and actual rivalry, there was no doubt on either side that up to the 18th century, Egypt was seen as the fount of all 'Gentile' philosophy and learning, including that of the Greeks; and that the Greeks had managed to preserve only some part ofthese. The sense of loss that this created, and the quest to recover the lost wisdom, were major motives in the development of science in the 17th century. I went on to show how at the beginning ofthe 18th century the threat ofEgyptian philosophy to Christianity became acute. The Freemasons, who made much use of the image of Egyptian wisdom, were at the centre ofthe Enlightenment in its attack on Christian order. And it was in opposition to this 18th-century notion of 'reason' on the part of the Egyptophils that the Greek ideal of sentiment and artistic perfection was developed. Further, the development of Europocentrism and racism, with the colonial expansion over the same period, led to the fallacy that only people who lived in temperate climates - that is, Europeans - could really think. Thus the Ancient Egyptians, who _ though their colour was uncertain -lived in Africa, lost their position as philosophers. They also suffered through the establishment ofthe new 'progressive' paradigm because they had lived so far in the past.
In this way, by the tum of the 18th century the Greeks were not only considered to have been more sensitive and artistic than the Egyptians but they were now seen as the better philosophers, and indeed as the founders ofphilosophy. I suggested that as the Greeks were now viewed as such paragons of wisdom and sensitivity, intelligent counterrevolutionary intellectuals saw the study ofthem as a way ofreintegrating people alienated by modem life; and even of re-establishing social harmony in the face of the French Revolution. Classics as we know it today was created between 1815 and 1830 - an intensely conservative
CONCLUSION 441
period. The same period also saw the Greek War of Independence, which united all Europeans against the traditional Islamic enemies from
Asia and Africa. This War - and the philhellenic movement, which supported the struggle for independence - completed the already powerful image of Greece as the epitome of Europe. The Ancient Greeks were now seen as perfect, and as having transcended the laws ofhistory and language. Thus it was now thought profane to study any aspect oftheir culture as one would the culture of other peoples. Moreover, with the rise of a " passionate and systematic racism in the early 19th century, the ancient notion that Greece was a mixed culture that had been civilized by Africans and Semites became not only abominable but unscientific.Just as one had to discount the 'credulous' Greeks' stories about sirens and centaurs, so one had to reject legends oftheir having been colonized by inferior races. Paradoxically, the more the 19th century admired the Greeks, the less it respected their writing of their own history. I see this destruction of the Ancient Model as entirely the result of social forces such as these, and the requirements put upon the Ancient Greeks by 19th-century Northern Europeans. My belief is that no internalist force - or advance in the knowledge ofAncient Greece - can explain the change. Having said this, I accept that the establishment of the Aryan Model was greatly helped by the working out of the IndoEuropean language family, which - though inspired by Romanticism was an internalist achievement; and by the undoubted fact that Greek is fundamentally an Indo-European language. But here, too, the same social and intellectual forces that had brought down the Ancient Model in the 1820S were even more intense in the 1840S and 50S, and they clearly played a role in the increasingly 'northern' picture of Ancient Greece that developed in the late 19th century. At the same time, the sense that only 19th-century men knew how to think 'scientifically' gave the - mainly German - scholars the confidence both to dismiss ancient descriptions of early Greek history and to invent new ones oftheir own without any regard to the Ancients. With the intensification of racism in the 19th century there was increasing dislike of the Egyptians, who were no longer seen as the cultural ancestors of Greece but as fundamentally alien. A whole new



442 BLACK ATHENA
discipline ofEgyptology could thus grow up, to study this exotic culture and at the same time maintain and reinforce Egypt's distance from the 'real' civilizations of Greece and Rome. The status of Egypt fell with the rise of racism in the 1820S; that of the Phoenicians declined with the rise of racial anti-Semitism in the 1880s and collapsed with its peak between 1917 and 1939. Thus, by the Second World War, it had been finnly established that Greece had not significandy borrowed culturally or linguistically from Egypt and Phoenicia and that the legends ofcolonization were charming absurdities, as were the stories ofthe Greek wise men having studied in Egypt. Indeed, these beliefs survived the years between 1945 and 1960, even though their ideological underpinnings of racism and anti-Semitism were generally being discredited in the academic community. Since the late 1960s, however, the Extreme Aryan Model has been under heavy attack, largely byJews and Semitists. The important role of Canaanites and Phoenicians in the formation ofAncient Greece is now being increasingly acknowledged. However, the traditional attribution of much of Greek civilization to Egypt is still denied; and in Greek language studies - the last bunker of Romanticism and the Extreme Aryan Model- any talk of significant Afroasiatic influence on Greek is ruled absurd. The main point I have been trying to make throughout this book is that the Ancient Model was destroyed and replaced by the Aryan Model not because of any internal deficiencies, nor because the Aryan Model explained anything better or more plausibly; what it did do, however, was make the history ofGreece and its relations to Egypt and the Levant conform to the world-view of the 19th century and, specifically, to its systematic racism. Since then the concepts of 'race' and categorical European superiority which formed the core of this Weltanschauung have been discredited both morally and heuristically, and it would be fair to say that the Aryan Model was conceived in what we should now call sin and error. However, I insist that its conception in sin, or even error, does not necessarily invalidate it. Darwinism, which was created at very much the same time and for many of the same 'disreputable' motives, has remained a very useful heuristic scheme. One could perfecdy well
CONCLUSION 443
argue that Niebuhr, Miiller, Curtius and the others were 'sleepwalking' in the sense in which Arthur Koesder used the term - to describe useful 'scientific' discoveries made for extraneous reasons and purposes which are not accepted in later times. All I claim for this volume is that it has provided a <;ase to be answered. That is, if the dubious origin of the Aryan Model does not make it false, it does call into question its inherent superiority over the Ancient Model. It is for this reason that the next volume in this series is concerned with the competition between the two models as effective tools for understanding Ancient
Greece.

WERE THE PHILISTINES GREEK?
T
HE PLAUSIBILITY OF A LINK between the two ethnic names . Pelasgoi and Peleset or Philistine was discussed in Chapter I, so it would be useful to consider the connections between the Philistines and Crete.l No one doubts that the people the Egyptians called the Prst came from the north-west, but there is considerable debate as to whether they came from Crete and the islands or from Mainland Anatolia. The British archaeologist Dr Sandars argues that Egyptian texts indicate that the Prst (philistines) came to the Levant by land. This would indicate an Anatolian invasion rather than an Aegean one. Furthermore, the Prst were associated in an Egyptian text with the Trs, who would seem to be the Trojans or Tyrsenoi from North-Western Anatolia.2 In the Bible the Philistine princes were known as lrdnim, a tide that could come from the Neo-Hittite Sarawanas/Tarawanas or the Greek tyrannos (from which comes our tyrant), which was supposedly borrowed from the Lydian. The helmet of the Philistine giant Goliath was called a qoba<, which may come from the Hittite kupabbi with the same meaning.3 The name Goliath itselfhas been linked to the Lydian name Alyattes.4 Finally, the Lydian historian Xanthos related that a Lydian hero, Mopsos, went from Lydia to Philistia.5 All these



BLACK ATHENA
pieces of evidence are used to indicate that the Philistines came from Anatolia rather than Crete. These arguments, however, are not as strong as they appear. Given the activities of Greeks in Cyprus and in Pamphylia and Cilicia in Southern Anatolia at this time, the late 13th and 12th centuries Be, there is no reason why some of them should not have come overland. According to the poet Kallinos, writing in the 7th century Be: 'Peoples led by Mopsos [a Greek hero of the Trojan War] passed over the Taurus, and that though some of them remained in Pamphylia, the others were dispersed in Cilicia, and also in Syria as far even as Phoenicia.,6 This account looks remarkably similar to the inscription of Ramesses III written early in the 12th century Be:
. . . as for the foreign countries, they made a conspiracy in their islands. All at once the lands were on the move, scattered in war. No country could stand before their arms: Hatti [Hittite Central Anatolia], Qode [Cilicia], Karkemesh [Upper Euphrates], Arzawa and Alashiya [Cyprus]. They were cut off, a camp was set up in Amur [Syria] ... Their league was Prst, Ikr, Skis, Dnn and WSS.7
Note that Ramesses III saw the conspiracy as having begun 'in their islands', which suggests the Aegean, Sicily or even Sardinia. It would also seem to indicate the presence ofthe Prst in this last campaign ofthe 'Sea Peoples'. It should be noted, too, that the Prst are linked here to the Ikr, who also settled in Palestine and who may have been associated with the Greek hero Teukros. The name Skis is almost certainly connected to Sicily, and Dnn to Danuna and the Danaans. The Trs were not listed on this occasion.8 The word Smm meaning 'princes' appears in Ugaritic texts showing that whether or not it had Anatolian links, the word sCrdnim was current on the Levant before the invasions and cannot be directly related to Anatolians among the invading 'Sea Peoples,.9 Qoba( may be related to
the Hittite kupabbi, but Hittites appear frequently in biblical Palestine and there is little doubt that Hittite influenced the Canaanite dialects spoken there. lO Wearing qoba(, moreover, was not restricted to Philistines. Astour has pointed out that this headgear was also worn by Saul,
APPENDIX 447
Egyptians, Babylonians, Tyrian mercenaries and even Yahwe himself.I I A connection between Goliath and Alyattes is possible, but according to the Book of Samuel, Goliath belonged to the Repa)Aun of Gath, who may have been Canaanite in the opinion ofJ. Strange, a modem student ofthe subject.I2 This suggestion seems unlikely to me. It would seem more probable that, like the West Semitic Ditanu and the Greek Titans, the RCpa>tm were the giant spirits of the dead. I3 Hence the title RCpa>tm may merely have referred to Goliath's size, and the
connection Goliath!Alyattes is a possibility. The strongest argument in favour ofan Anatolian migration remains the Lydian tradition that Mopsos the Lydian went from Lydia to Ashkelon in Philistia. However, as we have seen, there were also traditions of expeditions led by a Greek Mopsos, and by other Greek heroes, through Anatolia and Cyprus to the Levant. Apparent confirmation of the Greek Mopsos legends came with the discovery at Karatepe in Cilicia of an 8th-century bilingual inscription in hieroglyphic Hittite - or Luvian - and Phoenician. This refers to a kingdom , of Dnnym and to an ancestor called Muksas in Luvian and Mps in Phoenician.14 Confusingly, the ethnic name points to a Greek settlement, while that of the founder of the dynasty indicates an Anatolian one, which would give support to the Anatolian legend. Thus there are indications that Anatolian elements were involved in the Levant at the time of the 'Invasions of the Sea Peoples' in the 13th and 12th
centuries Be. Evidence for the involvement of Greek speakers is even stronger. Firstly, there is the consistent biblical tradition that the Philistines came from Kaphtor, Crete or the southern Aegean.I5 There are also references to mercenaries called KCretl and PCletl, who are always mentioned together and sometimes paralleled to the Philistines; it is generally thought that these are' Cretans and Philistines. They are usually associated with David, who fought not only against Philistines but for them. I6 It should be noted that Hebrew contained perfectly adequate names for Anatolian peoples: I:Iittl, Hittites who appear frequently, Tubal, Mesek and Tiras - the last may well be the same as the Egyptian Trs and the Trojans. Nevertheless, the Philistines were linked to none ofthese, but repeatedly and specifically to Kaphtor;



BLACK ATHENA
thus there seems no reason to doubt the biblical links between the Philistines and Crete.
From the archaeological point ofview it is striking that the so-called 'Philistine pottery', found largely in the areas associated with the biblical Philistines, is locally made but resembles the style known as Mycenaean III C lB. The closest parallels come from Tarsus in Cilicia, Cyprus, and Knossos in Crete. There is no question, however, that the style originated in the Aegean and that the other regions where it has been found correspond well with the reports ofGreek settlement at this period. 17 The fact that the culture ofPhilistia from the 12th to the lOth
century BC shows strong Egyptian influence is not surprising in view of its closeness to Egypt, and the fact that many Sea Peoples served as mercenaries for the Egyptians. Thus the written and the archaeological evidence connecting the Philistines to the Aegean agree to an extent that is rare, if not unique. Despite this, however, the Israeli archaeologist Dr Dothan admits in her massive work on the Philistines that their material culture came from the Aegean, but insists that the Philistines were Illyrians, Thracians or Anatolians; anything, in fact, other than Greeks.18
Working on the probable assumption that the bulk of the Philistines originated from Crete and the Aegean and made Mycenaean pottery, it becomes extremely likely that they spoke Greek. Although a nonHellenic Eteocretan survived in Crete until Hellenistic times, as mentioned above, we know from Linear B that Greek was the dominant language on the island well over a century before the earliest reference to the Prst.
There are other indications, too, that the Philistines were associated with Greece. Assyrian texts refer to a certain la-ma-ni or la-ad-na, two different forms both meaning 'Greek', who seized the throne of the Philistine city ofAshdod and rebelled against Assyria in 7 I 2 BC. There has been considerable debate as to whether this man was a Greek or a local leader. 19 But although it has been clearly established that the Philistines were rapidly Semitized, the problem of la-ma-ni could be resolved by following the hypothesis that some influential 8th-century Philistines were ofGreek descent.
After the Scythian invasion of the 7th century and the Neo
APPENDIX 449
Babylonian deportations ofthe 6th, the name 'Philistine' seems to have
been partially replaced by Gazan ('azzdti) and Ashdodite eafrMdi), from the two chief cities of the region. In about 400 BC Nehemiah condemned Jewish marriage to the women of Ashdod and referred to the 'language ofAshdod', JafrMdit, as a threatto the 'language of the Jews', y ehudit.2o The meaning ofthe latter term is uncertain but, because both
Aramaic and Hebrew were spoken byJews at this time, it is unlikely that Nehemiah was concerned about a West Semitic language. On the other hand, Greek, which was expanding rapidly throughout the East Mediterranean, would seem to be a much more likely threat. There is no biblical word for 'Greek' as a language. Therefore it would seem plausible to propose that by )asrMdit Nehemiah meant 'Greek' - yet another indication oflinks between Greeks and Philistines. A further indication ofcontacts between Philistia and Greece at this period is that in about 400 BC Gaza was the only city east of Athens minting coins according to Attic weights. It should be noted, however, that they were inscribed with Phoenician letters - some even with an inscription reading either Yhd 0ew) or Yhw (Yahweh) - and a depiction ofa seated figure who would seem to be the god ofIsrael.21 Other coins from the town have the inscription MEINQ, which is supposed to be related to Minos of Crete.22
Despite the fierce defences of Jaffa and Gaza against Alexander, subsequent Hellenization of the region was far more complete than in either Phoenicia or Judaea. As Victor Tcherikover, the great historian of the Hellenistic period, implies, this would seem to indicate a propensity to Greek culture.23 Stephanos of Byzantium, for instance, writing in the 5th century AD, stated that the god Marna, worshipped at Gaza, was Zeus Kretogenes, 'born in Crete'.24
To sum up: the closest analogy to the invasion of the 'Sea Peoples' would seem to be that of the Crusades. Waves of northern invaders came by land and sea in a period ofgreat confusion; bands crisscrossed each other in their search for plunder and land to settle. The Crusaders were largely Romance-speaking but of different dialect nationalities, and they also included Germans and English. Similarly, the Sea Peoples seem to have been made up of different linguistic groups, including both Greek and Anatolian speakers. The likelihood is that



450 BLACK ATHENA
although other groups may have been largely made up of Anatolian speakers, the Philistines were predominantly Greeks. Until the decipherment of Linear B as Greek, however, the Philistines' Cretan connection provided no embarrassment; it wc1s easy to see them as Pre-Hellenes. The failure of scholars since 1952 to recognize the powerful evidence linking the Philistines to the Greeks can be explained only in terms ofthe 19th- and 20th-century view of 'Philistines' as the exact opposite ofthe Hellenes - as enemies of culture.

A plausible derivation would be from the Egyptian It found in Demotic and as riot in Coptic meaning 'barley'. ;t m ;t in Middle and Late Egyptian, literally 'barley in barley', means 'really barley' - presumably referring to the grain or kernel. In Greek one finds the term eteokrithos (good or genuine barley). For the centrality and seriousness of wordplay in ancient civilization, see below. Whether or not Eteokretes is a pun on eteokrithos, it would seem a plausible etymology for "'eteos. There is probably, however, some contamination from the Egyptian ;t(y), Coptic riot, 'forefathers'. This would seem to be the origin of the clan-name Eteoboutades, the hereditary priests ofthe temple of Athena Polias in Athens. 17. J. Berard (195 1, p. 129) and Lochner-Hiittenbach, p. 142.

Further confirmation of the Egyptian etymology would seem to come from yet another Greek name for primitive people - which is also particularly associated with Attica - Paion. Scholars are generally agreed that it is cognate with Ion or Iaon but they cannot understand the supposedly 'Pre-Hellenic' mechanism by which the two are related; see the bibliography in Cromey (1978, p. 63).

The uncertainty ofthe initial sibilant in Xouthos and Zethos, which is probably also a variant ofSeth, may well come from confusion with the Canaanite - the god of the sea and hunting - and the Semitic root (hunt), an activity which was ofcentral importance to both Seth and Po!eidon, whose name was sometimes written Po!.eido/an.

See Garvie (p. 7I) and Johansen and Whitde (1980, vol. 2, pp. 105-6). It would seem to me legitimate to link it, at least at a punning level, to the Egyptian root Vbn, found in the words wbn (rise like the sun) and bnbn (point or peak) or the (primeval hill). See A. B.

Meyer claims that the vocalization of Belos indicates that the name could not have come from the Canaanite ba(albut must come from the Aramaic befit; it must therefore be late. It could equally, however, have changed from "'Balos to Belos in Greek. 104. The great intricacies of the Egypto-Semitic roots and the word phoinix will be discussed in vol. 2. 105. Astour (1967a, p. 81). 106. In two parallel texts dating to around 2500 BC, one from the Syrian city of Ebla and the other from the Mesopotamian site of Abu Salabikh, one finds the two names Am-ni and DA-neki in matching places in what seems to be the western region (G. Pettinato, 1978, p. 69, no. 186). The author has suggested to me (personal communication, March 1983) that the former could be related to the Cretan city of Amnisos, the name ofwhich is now attested in both Linear Band Egyptian from the 2nd millennium. In this case - or even if Am-ni were merely a generic term for 'the west', which in Egyptian is >imn - the land ofDa-ne could well refer to Crete.

See Griffiths (1970, p. 3f). Coptic has an interesting tenn, hasie, which Cerny derives from the older (praised drowned person). This is clearly linked to these legends. The Greek stem hosio- (sacred, free from pollution) would seem to derive from this rather than from the Indo-European root Yes (be). This will be discussed in more detail in vol. 3· 16. Lambert (198f, pp. 126-42). 17. Gamer-Wallert (1977, pp. 228-34); Griffiths (1970, pp. 342-3, 422-3). 18. Although Dagon would seem to be related to the Greek drakon-, (fish) or (dragon), it has been traditionally identified with the Hebrew dJg (fish). However, dJgan means 'grain', and there is an old Semitic god Dagan, who in fact seems to have been pre-eminent in 3rd-millennium Ebla (Pettinato, 1981, pp. 246-8). Clearly, punning went on between the two. In any event, the Israelites considered fish as neither sacred nor taboo.

The attempt to reduce Hermeticism and surrounding philosophies to one system has been made by several scholars - notably J. KroIl- with infinitely greater knowledge of the field than me. However, as modem scholarship generally depends on making finer and finer distinctions, the splitters have so far defeated the lumpers here. See Blanco (1984, p. 2268). 26.

33· The prominence of women in their theology, and among the Gnostics themselves, fits well with the freedom gained by upper-class women in late Antiquity. See Pagels (1979, pp. 48-69). Equally, there is no doubt that the social status of women was traditionally far higher in Egypt than in either Canaan or Greece. Pagels (pp. 63-4) cites Professor Morton Smith as saying plausibly that Christian attitudes to women hardened as the predominant social class within the religion shifted from the lower class - in which, because women were necessary to the economy of the family, they had a certain equality - to the middle class, where they were secluded at home. 34· Blanco (1984, p. 2242). 35.

48 . Petrie (1908, pp. 196, 224-5; 1909, pp. 85-91). Petrie's argument and my acceptance of it are based on plausibility rather than certainty. It is possible that writers in the 2nd century AD deliberately set their writings in the Persian period, just as Heliodoros appears to have done in his novelAithiopika. However, the lack ofostentation, the intricacy and consistency ofthe setting ofthe Hermetic Texts, the universal attribution to them of antiquity and the clear ideological purpose of those who have wished to down-date them, make the earlier date more
likely.

The very richly furnished tomb of Childeric was found in 1653, and although some of the objects rapidly disappeared, the bulk were soon published with illustrations by Jean-Jacques Chiflet, an eminent doctor interested in archaeology. In the 19th century the objects went through many vicissitudes. Thus, although some of the treasure is now in the Cabinet des Medailles in Paris, modem scholars have had to rely on the 17th- and 18th-century publications. On the whole - and where they still have the objects for comparison - modem scholars are very much impressed by the accuracy of their early observations. However, Dr Dumas, the latest writer on the subject, rejects Chiflet's attribution of the bull's head to Apis and writes that there is no need to look for Egyptian or
NOTES TO CHAPTER II
even Roman origins, as one can find them among the Scythians, Persians and Hittites. She rightly points out that there are 'more or less similar' Scythian parallels (1976, pp. 42-3). The reasons for mentioning the Hittites, whose Anatolian culture had died out over 1,000 years earlier, can only be the barbaric heaviness oftheir art and the fact that they were Indo-European speakers. Given the facts that Childeric was for most of his life a client of the Romans and spent some time at the court of Attila in Hungary, and that Egyptian religion had been influential in the Northern provinces of the Late Empire in what are now Germany, Austria and Hungary well into the 5th century (Selem, 1980; Wessetzky, 1961), as well as the fact that the Christian Charlemagne considered Serapis ofimportance, there is nothing outrageous in the idea that there could have been
Egyptian influence. However, this outrage also appears when she considers Chiflet's report of Egyptian scarabs in the tomb. As she explains this 'howler':
Dealing with silver coins, some of which were pierced, Chiflet had reproduced, as a comparison, certain examples from his collection, but also scarabs. In the 18th century, the learned Benedictine Bernard de Montfaucon (one ofthe greatest scholars ofthe time) inadvertently included these scarabs, considered as Frankish coins ... this error was repeated because of the authority that Montfaucon enjoyed. It was thus that the tomb ofChilderic was once augmented with twenty or so Egyptian scarabs! (1976, p. 6)
Why should she see her forerunners as having made a chain of such improbable errors? There are, in fact, powerful ideological reasons why 19th- and 20thcentury scholars should have wanted to remove the scarabs. The Germanic Frankish kings who founded the French monarchy are very dear to the heart of the French Right, and to those believing in collaboration between France and Germany. It is no coincidence that the symbol ofVichy France was thefrancisque, the Frankish double-headed axe - a splendid example of which was found in Childeric's thomb. Thus the presence of Egyptian scarabs in such a shrine to Aryan, northern barbarian vigour was intolerable.

There certainly was a tradition ofEgypt's having borrowed knowledge from 'Syria', which we can now reasonably equate with Phoenicia, Syria and Mesopotamia. Furthermore, there is no substantial objection to linking Moschos with the Hebrew or Aramaic Moseh, as sin was sometimes transcribed into Greek as sch and the -os is clearly a Greek nominal ending. This is not to say that the Israelites had comparable -let alone superior - 'scientific' knowledge to the Egyptians. Furthermore, transcriptions s>sch are late; this would provide phonetic backing to the hypothesis that these traditions are from Hellenistic times, when there was a belief that the Jews were great astronomers (see Theophrastos, Peri Euseb, 1.8, cited in M.

Apart from its intrinsic merit, the survival ofTheMagicFlute- despite the fact that its libretto was unsuitable for the Romantic period - would seem to be linked to the fact that it was the first major opera in German.

I argue in Bernal (1987a; forthcoming, 1988) that the Ionian alphabet is much older than the Dorian alphabets which contained the P, and that the letter was therefore introduced into the Greek alphabet around 1000 BC - much later than c. 1600, when I date the transmission ofthe alphabet as a whole. That is not to deny Bendey's discovery of the phoneme w, although I believe that some ofthe failures to elide may be the result ofGreek borrowing, or at least reflexes or awareness, of a Semitic or Egyptian '/D';n.

.s. It is absurd to deny the tide of,historian' to Sima Q!an and the succeedingwriters and compilers of the Chinese dynastic histories, or to the great Ibn Khaldun and later Moslem 'historians'. For a discussion of this in the Islamic context, see Abdel-Malek (1969, pp. 199-230). A survival of the view that only Aryans can write history comes in the claim that the Indo-European-speaking Hittites invented it in the Ancient Near East. See, for instance, Butterfield (1981 ,

The big exception to this pattern isJapan, the scale and power ofwhich would have made it extraordinarily difficult to fit into the colonial system and which must be seen in conjunction with what, to the Westerners, was the much bigger

127. De Rouge (1869, p. 330); cited in Hornung (1983, p. 18). According to Budge (1904, voL I, p. 142), Champollion Figeac, the devoted elder brother of Jean-Franrrois, believed in Egyptian monotheism. Hornung (1983, p. 18) uses the significant phrase 'had already proposed'. This supposes that the modern discipline of Egyptology should be cut off completely from its 'prehistory', and that everything in it was a new discovery.

Late-19th- and earlY-20th-century Egyptology was very reluctant to recognize the sophistication of Egyptian literature. See the recent di.scussion of the 'prosaic' Tale ofSinuhe (Baines, 1982). Similarly, there was a tendency to describe Egyptian 'Wisdom Literature' as utilitarian and not reli

It would be interesting, for instance, to consider the impact of Washington's splendid Masonic funeral. It may be inevitable that scholars, like everyone else, should kick their predecessors in the teeth, but it is still sad that Professor Farrell should be so contemptuous towards Jessica Mitford (p. 213), who opened up this important field, and from whom he stole his title. 157.

There is no doubt that Homer was thought to be a oral performer in Antiquity; this tradition is strengthened by the most plausible Egyptian etymology for his name, or a general word for poet, from 'art ofutterance'. See above, ch. III, Note 61. Wolf did not go into the problems of the origin of the Greek alphabet. His supposition on this was shared by the promoters ofthe Extreme AIYan Model in the 20th centuIY.

These 'Cyclopean' buildings may well have a common ancestry in Anatolia. The walls and gates of Mycenae and other Mycenaean cities and fortifications would seem to be the result ofthe wave ofAnatolian influence associated in legend with the conquest of Pelops in the 14th century Be. The buildings of this type in Italy can be associated with the Etruscans, whom ancient tradition maintained had come from North-West Anatolia. Thus I believe that this style was introduced after the major Egyptian influence on Greece at the beginning ofthe Late Bronze Age, but before the chief Phoenician one in the lOth and 9th centuries. 110.

His work on the Etruscans won the prize offered by the Prussian Academy: 'To explain and exhibit critically the nature and constitution of the training of the Etruscan nation'. See Donaldson (18S8, p. xxii). Beyond reflecting the Etruscomania of the turn of the 18th century, which was especially promoted by the Bonapartes, who may have seen themselves as Etruscans, some Germans identified themselves with this ancient people (see Poliakov, 1974, pp. 65-6; Borsi, 1985). Niebuhr claimed, in his first edition, that the Etruscans had come from north of the Alps, which would explain the interest of the Prussian Academy.

on Greek mythology, Jane Harrison (1925, p. 84) saw beyond this when she compared the brilliant SeInitist Robertson-SInith - whose religious background had allowed him to stay within the Broad Aryan Model and maintain that there had been Near Eastern influence on Greece - to the Classicist Frazer, who argued much less threateningly for anthropological parallels:
Robertson-SInith, exiled for heresy, had seen the star in the East; in vain, we classical deaf adders stopped our ears and closed our eyes.

For Renan's notion that by studying Semitic culture he was in some sense creating it, see Said (1978, p. 140). 27. Renan (1855); cited in Gaulmier (1978, p. 47); see also Faverty (1951, p. 169). 28.

31. Cited in Faverty (1951, p. 76). 32. See Faverty (1951, esp. pp. 111-61). 33. See M. Arnold (1906). The great 19th-century romanticizer of the Gypsies, George Borrow, was extremely interested in their language and those of other Eastern Indo-European speakers like the Armenians (1851, chs 27,47). Borrow's descriptions ofthe Gypsy natural philosopherJasper Petulengro (1857, ch. 9) were extremely popular in Victorian and Edwardian England; see Borrow (1851; 1857). The British cult of the Gypsy/Bohemian was not accepted in Germany. When it came to the Holocaust, their Indo-European language was no more protection to them than the Jews' Germanic one, Yiddish. 34· See Faverty (1951, p. 167). 35· Faverty(195 1,PP· 162-85). 36. For Matthew Arnold's 'Hellenism' as a major factor in Britain's decline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, see Wiener (1981, pp. 30-7). 37. M. Arnold (1869, p. 69).

Evans, who was by this time projecting nonSemitic Minoans everywhere, including Phoenicia, agreed with the Grand Old Man. 49. Michelet (1962, p. 68). 50. Michelet (1831, pp. 177-8). 51. See ch. III, Note 27. 52. Gesenius (1815, p. 6). The classification of Semitic languages is in fact a very disputed subject which has been made much more complicated today by the discovery of several more ancient and modern ones. For more discussion of my views on this, see Bernal (1980). There has never been any doubt about Gesenius' identification of Phoenician with Hebrew rather than with the Berber languages. 53· Gesenius (1815, p. 4); Gobineau (1983, pp. 380- 1). 54.

For a critical treatment ofthis fascination, see Said (1978, esp. pp. 180-97). AsJean Bruneau points out (Flaubert, 1973, vol. 2, p. 1354): 'Ofall Flaubert's works, SalammbO is without doubt the least studied. There is no good edition and its genesis is badly known.' See also Bruneau's bibliography on the subject. 66. Benedetto (1920, p. 39); A. Green (1982, p. 28); Starkie (197 I, p. 14). My claim that the Mutiny triggered Flaubert's interest in this topic and remained an important modern parallel in his mind does not in any way try to discredit the important parallels Dr Green has shown between SalammbO and the French Revolution of 1848; see A. Green (1982, pp. 73-93). 67. Letter, early May 1861; quoted in English by Starkie (1971, p. 22). 68. See Starkie (197I,PP. 20-2). 69· See Starkie (197 1, pp. 58-9). 70. See Benedetto (1920).

For Canaanite terms see, for instance, byblinos (cordage), related to the city name Byblos; )eldh, elate (oar) from 'eldh/)elat (mighty tree, post); gaulos (vessel) from gulldh (vessel). To my mind, Chantraine (1928, p. 18) dismisses the IndoEuropean "'ku(m)bara (shaft) as an etymon for kubern- (steering oar) too readily. However, there would also seem to be influence from the Semitic root Ykbr (great). Chantraine admitted the possibility of the Egyptian etymology for baris, but - writing in the 1920S - he denied the Semitic loans, attributing the vast majority of maritime words that cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European to the 'Pre-Hellenes' or 'Mediterranean stock'. For the Egyptian etymologies, see vol. 2.

Neither of these believed in significant Egyptian influence, so they failed to note that Skandeia which has no Indo-European etymology - probably derives from the Egyptian shmty (the double crown of Egypt), which, with the article PJ-, was transcribed htto Greek as psent. I believe that many, if not most, of Berard's doublets are in fact between Egyptian and Semitic rather than between Greek and Semitic. 38.

I must first of all thank my publishers Rutgers University Press
and, in particular, Leslie Michener for their extraordinary patience. This volume was promised in 1987 and expected in the early ’90s! My excuses for the elephantine gestation are, first, that I was distracted by the polemics surrounding the first two volumes and by the need I felt to compile Black Athena Writes Back and work on its aborted twin Debating Black Athena. A more important factor, however, was that I had massively underestimated the work required to enlarge and make my scrappy manuscript for this volume presentable. Above all there has been my congenital laziness. Among the many others I should like to express my deep gratitude to Mary Jo Powell, who courageously took on the editing of this manuscript. I also want especially to thank Roger Blench and Gary Rendsburg for their stimulus and encouragement and for reading chapters of this book, with which of course they were not in complete agreement. I was helped greatly in the preparation of this volume by James Hoch, Saul Levin and John Pairman Brown. Louisa Bennion greatly assisted me in the considerable enlargement of the bibliography. I am deeply indebted to her as I am to Marilyn Campbell for her patient and charming author handling over the last year. I must also express special thanks to Paddy Culligan and Karen English-Loeb for their preparation of the maps. The series as a whole would have been impossible without the scholarly

I must also thank the following for their great help and encouragement: Anouar Abdel Malek, Lynne Abel, Garth Alford, Fred Ahl, Michael Astour, George Bass, Jacques Berlinerblau, John Boardman, Anthony Bulloch, Walter Burkert, Paul Cartledge, Chen Yiyi, Noam Chomsky, Cyrus Chotya, Geneva Cobb-Moore, Erwin Cook, Paddy Culligan, Peter Daniels, Robert Drews, Emmanuel Eze, Dan Flory, Kirstin Fudeman, Cyrus Gordon, Friedrich Graf, R.

Sadly, but inevitably, given the length of time I have taken to complete this book, a number of these scholars are now dead. My involvement, not to say obsession, with the Black Athena project over the past 30 years has not always made me a responsive or responsible family member. Therefore, I want to thank all my family for their patience and love: my sons, Paul, Adam and Patrick, my daughter Sophie, her husband Mark and their two children Charlotte and Ben. Then there are my son William, his partner Vanessa and their Katie and Dan. Above all there is my wife Leslie, who for 28 years has given me the intellectual stimulus and emotional support necessary for such a long undertaking.



TRANSCRIPTIONS AND PHONETICS
RECONSTRUCTIONS
T
he reconstructions of Nostratic, Afroasiatic, and Indo-Hittite follow those of the scholars upon whose work the relevent chapters are largely based. These are Allan Bomhard and John C. Kerns for Nostratic; Vladimir E. Orel and Olga V. Stolbova for Afroasiatic; and Thomas V. Gamkrelidze and Vjac*eslav V. Ivanov for Indo-Hittite. Their reconstructions are similar but not identical. All use an apostrophe after stops p’, t’, k’ to indicate emphatic, sometimes glottalic consonants. Their precise nature is unclear but they are neither voiced nor unvoiced. When quoting Bomhard and Kerns and Gamkriledze and Ivanov, I use a capital H to signal a “laryngeal” of uncertain precise quality, as they have been lost in all branches of Indo-Hittite (except Anatolian). H is not necessary for describing the super-family of Proto
Afroasiatic because distinct “laryngeals” >, œ, h,  ̇ and ∆ have been preserved in several of its families. The diacritic [h] after a stop indicates a phonetic not phonemic, or meaningful alternation.
EGYPTIAN
The orthography used in Egyptian words is the standard one used by Anglo-American Egyptologists and in previous volumes of this series,



xviii BLACK ATHENA
the only exception being that the sign traditionally transcribed as k≥ is written q in this volume. Whatever the exact sound of the Å in Old and Middle Egyptian (34001600 BCE), it was used where Semitic names contained r, l, or even n. This consonantal value was retained until the beginning of the New Kingdom. In Late Egyptian (spoken, 1600–700 BCE), it appears to have become an >aleph and later, like the Southern English r, it merely modified adjacent vowels. The Egyptian ˆ corresponded to the Semitic >aleph and yo\d. >Aleph is found in many languages and in nearly all Afroasiatic ones. It is a glottal stop before vowels, as in the Cockney “bo>l” and “bu>E” (bottle and butter). The Egyptian ‘ayin, which occurs in most Semitic languages, is a voiced or spoken >aleph. The Egyptian form seems to have been associated with the back vowels o and u. In early Egyptian, the sign w, written as a quail chick, may have originally had purely consonantal value. In Late Egyptian, the stage of the Egyptian spoken language that had most impact on Greek, it seems to have been frequently pronounced as a vowel, either o or u. The Egyptian sign transcribed as r was more usually rendered as l in Semitic and Greek. In later Egyptian, as with the 3, it weakened to become a mere modifier of vowels. The Egyptian and Semitic h≥ was pronounced as an emphatic h. It appears that the sign conventionally transcribed in Egyptian as h°was originally a voiced g;. In Middle and Late Egyptian, it was devoiced to become something approximating the Scottish ch in “loch.” The sign transcribed as h_was pronounced as hy°. In Middle and Late Egyptian, it was frequently confused with s. ̈s ̈used to transcribe a sign that originally sounded something like h.°It later was pronounced as sh or skh. As mentioned above, q represents an emphatic k≥. The letter t_was probably originally pronounced as ty. Even in Middle Egyptian it was already being confused with t. Similarly, d_was frequently alternated with d. In Late Egyptian, voiced and unvoiced stops tended to merge. Thus, there was confusion among t, t, d_, and d.
Egyptian names
Egyptian divine names are vocalized according to the most common Greek transcriptions, for example, Amon for >Imn and Isis for St. Royal names generally follow A. H. Gardiner’s (1961) version of the Greek names for well-known pharaohs, for instance, Ramesses.



TRANSCRIPTIONS AND PHONETICS xix
Coptic
Most of the letters in the Coptic alphabet come from Greek and the same transcriptions are used. Six other letters derived from Demotic are transcribed as follows:
v s= ] h° j j [ f ; h / c=
Semitic
The Semitic consonants are transcribed relatively conventionally. Several of the complications have been mentioned above in connection with Egyption. Apart from these, one encounters the following. In Canaanite, the sound h°merged with h≥. Transcriptions here sometimes reflect an etymological h°rather than the later h≥. t ≥ is an emphatic t. The Arabic letter tha’\ usually transcribed as th is written here as ty. The same is true of the dhal\, which is written here as dy. The letter found in Ugaritic that corresponds to the Arabic ghain is transcribed as g;. The West Semitic tsade was almost certainly pronounced ts and the letter s;in originally seems to have been a lateral fricative similar to the Welsh ll. In transcriptions of Hebrew from the First Millennium BCE the letter shin is rendered s=. Elsewhere, it is transcribed simply as s because I question the antiquity and range of the pronunciation s=. Neither the dagesh nor begadkephat are indicated in the transcription. This is for reasons of simplicity as well as because of doubts about their range and occurrence in antiquity.
Vocalization
The Masoretic vocalization of the Bible, completed in the ninth and tenth centuries CE but reflecting much older pronunciation, is transcribed as follows:
Name of sign Plain with y y with w w with h h
Patah≥ Bæba – – –
Qaæmes≥ B; bå yBæbâ – h B; båh H≥îreq Bibi yB≥ bî – –
S≥e\rê B ́be\ yB ́bê – hB ́be\h



xx BLACK ATHENA
Segol\ B, be yB, bê≥ – hB, beh H≥ol\em B bo\ – – wOB bô hB bo\h Qibûs≥ B ̈bu – – WB bû –
The reduced vowels are rendered:
B]be j} h≥a= j’h≥e= j’ho.=
Accentuation and cantillation are not normally marked.
GREEK
With some hesitation I have privileged the Greek alphabet over the Hebrew (Aramaic) and Egyptian hieroglyphs by retaining it whenever a new term is introduced, while transliterating all other scripts. The reason for this is that Egyptologists and Semitists as well as many lay users of the Roman alphabet find the Greek alphabet easy to read. By contrast, relatively few classicists can read Hebrew and virtually none, hieroglyphics. Determinatives are included when they can provide information not available from the transcription. The transcriptions of the consonants is orthodox. The same is true of the vowels h and w, which are written as /e\/ and /o\/. Long a\is rendered /a\/. U is conventionally transcribed as /y/ despite the fact that nearly all the borrowings mentioned in these volumes took place before u /u/ was fronted to become /ü/. Some Semitic loans into Greek may be later as the same shift took place in Phoencian. Nevertheless, the most regular correspondences with the Greek u were with earlier Semitic and Hebrew /u/ or Egyptian /w/.

BLACK ATHENA






THE PREVIOUS VOLUMES AND THEIR RECEPTION
I
n 1879 the pioneer anthropogist E. B. Tylor published his famous article comparing the Mexican game patolli with the Indian board game pachisi. He argued that the two were not independent inventions but the result of diffusion from one to the other.1 He based his case on the great number of similarities between the two games. As he wrote in a later article: “The probability of contact increases in ratio to the number of arbitrary similar elements in any two trait-complexes”2 [my italics]. Volume 3 of this project is based on this principle. It is concerned with language, different aspects of which are more or less arbitrary. Phonology is ultimately limited by the mouth and tongue. Therefore, to link two items convincingly they must share multiple phonetic similarities either within the word or in its context. Morphology, syntax and lexicon, however, are inherently arbitrary, though most languages have more onomatopoeia and phonesthemics than Ferdinand de Saussure supposed, when he declared the absolute distinction between signifier and signified. In any event, words are not fishhooks. Phonetic and semantic similarities between items in different languages should be taken much more seriously than similarities among fishing gear. Language is the most controversial aspect of the Black Athena project.
INTRODUCTION
Mixture is the ultimate engine of growth in society. (Laurence Angel, 1971)



2 BLACK ATHENA
Many reviewers of the first two volumes have taken the position that the historiography was more or less all right, the archaeology was dubious and the language was crazy. This is a thoroughly liberal or broad-minded response: “on the one hand, on the other and in the middle. . . . ” After the publication of Volume 2, The Archaeological Evidence, the reaction to this aspect of the work became more nuanced. Reviewers generally disliked my “methodology” or rather of what they saw as my lack of method. On the other hand, there was a reluctance to challenge my conclusions especially those concerning the closeness of relations around the East Mediterranean during the Bronze Age, 3000–1000 BCE. The generally hostile anonymous reviewer in the archaeological journal Antiquity put his or her finger on this sense of unease: “Bernal has the alarming habit of being right for the wrong reasons.”3 It seems to me that if “being right” is not merely the result of a fluke but has become habitual then one should question why the conventional “reasons” could have led to the wrong conclusions. I believe that the answer is quite simple. Where I have merely aimed at “competitive plausibility” conventional scholars in these fields have required “proof.” Specifically they have tended toward minimalism in both time and space. This tendency leads to an acceptance of the argument from silence. On questions of time they assume that a phenomenon was not present until shortly before it is first attested. Spatially, they have given the privileged position to isolation and required proof of contact between different cultures and societies. The ideological reasons for this latter requirement as it affected the East Mediterranean were considered at length in Volume 1 of Black Athena. Essentially, they were to preserve a pure, and purely European, image of Ancient Greece. During the past three decades the historiography of the ancient East Mediterranean has shifted significantly. In the first place, archaeologists have discovered increasing evidence of close contacts between Egypt and the Levant on the one hand and the Aegean on the other: an Egyptian statue base with place names from the Aegean; Egyptian and Levantine styles and representations on the wonderful frescoes uncovered under the volcanic deposits of Thera, which erupted in the seventeenth century BCE.4 Others include the Mesopotamian and Syrian seals found at the Greek Thebes; the astoundingly rich and cosmopolitan fourteenth-century shipwreck found off the South Turkish coast near Kas∫‘; the paintings with Egypto-Minoan motifs found at Tel Ed Daba’a,



INTRODUCTION 3
the capital of the Hyksos, who were Syrian rulers of lower Egypt in the seventeenth century BCE. There are also the newly published pictures of Mycenaean Greeks found in Eighteenth Dynasty Egyptian representations. Lead isotope analysis indicates that some copper and silver found in fourteenth-century Egypt was mined at Laurion in Attica.5 Finally, there is a strong possibility that two Egyptian-style pyramids long known in the Argolid in the northeast of the Peloponnese should now be dated to the first half of the Third Millennium BCE, the pyramid age in Egypt. Previously they were thought to be of classical or Helenistic construction. This revised dating indicates cultural influences from the Nile to the Aegean at this very early period.6 Such discoveries have made archaeologists reluctant to dismiss out of hand the hypotheses of profound cross-cultural influences. At the same time as this internalist pressure or academic influence has arisen from within the disciplines, externalist forces of reaction against racism and anti-Semitism have been widespread in academia since the 1960s. These have combined with a growing awareness of the social embeddedness of knowledge and the acceptance that earlier classicists and ancient historians not only operated in racist and anti-Semitic societies but were sometimes pioneers of these unsavory movements. Thus, in the 1980s some broad-minded scholars, notably Walter Burkert, Martin West and Sarah Morris, published powerful works stressing the importance of Levantine influences on the Aegean and recognizing that a major reason for their previous neglect had been the anti-Semitism of earlier scholars.7 These works were conceived in the late 1970s at very much the same time as Black Athena and would seem to be the result of the same intellectual atmosphere or Zeitgeist. The fact that these scholars were professionals, however, sharply differentiated their works from Black Athena both in their nature and in their reception. In time, Burkert and Morris, though not West, tend to limit the “oriental” influence they see in Greece to the Late Archaic period, 750–500 BCE, rather than including the Bronze Age. In space, all three restrict this influence to the Levant and do not include Egypt.8 These limitations have eased the reception of their work. The enthusiastic welcome given to these works—Sarah Morris’s book received the annual prize of the American Institute of Archaeology—needs further explanation. This acceptance sharply contrasts to the hostility many classicists have expressed towards Black Athena and, earlier, to the works of



4 BLACK ATHENA
Cyrus Gordon, as well as to Michael Astour’s thoroughly scholarly volume Hellenosemitica that detailed many striking mythological parallels between the Levant and the Aegean.9 These works were rejected not merely for their content, but also because they were written by outsiders: Gordon and Astour were very distinguished Semitists. Not only status but also content, however, was important. Although earlier works by classicists, such as those by Martin West’s Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient or Peter Walcot on Hesiod or Ruth Edwards’s Cadmus the Phoenician, were not savaged. Rather, these works were not taken seriously by the classical establishment. That is to say, their work had no perceptible influence upon the way classicists carried on their isolationist business as usual.10
“CLASSICS HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD”
In the 1990s things changed drastically. The opening passage of the presidential address to the American Philological Association in January 1993 shows this change. Ludwig Koenen, the president of this largest and most prestigious body of classicists in the world, addressed his colleagues:
Since the beginning of this century, an increasing number of scholars in our field have studied the influence of Near Eastern cultures upon the Greeks: archaeologists and art historians have articulated the Orientalizing period; new finds cast light even into the Dark Age; the decipherment of linear B has changed our view of Greek prehistory; unearthing many new texts in Greek, Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern languages has advanced our knowledge of these societies. We can no longer afford to look at early Greece in isolation. What is known to researchers, however, does not always reach the classroom, and the general public is hardly aware that our picture of ancient cultures and, in particular, of early Greek culture, has undergone dynamic changes. The Western tradition, with its hold on education, has tended to stress the uniqueness of Greek culture and literature. . . . 11
This sophisticated defense of the discipline of classics refutes charges that it failed to set Ancient Greece in its wider geographical and cultural context. The professionals can now argue that my work and that of all



INTRODUCTION 5
the Afrocentists are redundant because for many decades they themselves have been completely open to the idea of foreign influences on Ancient Greece. What is more, they can view our work as pernicious because they see it as “politicizing,” and making polemical, issues that should remain objective and purely academic.12 The idea that the Afrocentrists and I introduced politics into this area of ancient history is no longer tenable. Thoughtful observers now generally accept the fact that ideology intensely influenced classics as a discipline in its formative period in the early nineteenth century, as I set out in Volume 1 of Black Athena.
This present-day acceptance seems to contradict Koenen’s view that, while the professionals knew about the outside influences on Ancient Greece, not they but the educators were reluctant to divulge these facts. This claim but has some truth, at least since the onset of self-consciously reactionary cultural politics after 1980. Before then, however, many general historians, such as H. G. Wells in his Outline of History and Will and Ariel Durant in their Story of Civilization, were no more misleading about interrelations around the Mediterranean than the classicists. See, for instance, the isolationism in the popularizing works of such professionals in the field as H.D.F. Kitto, Moses Finley or Chester Starr.13 Koenen’s claim that the misapprehension came from the professionals’ failure to communicate the results of their research is seriously misleading. Classicists bear a major share of the blame for perpetuating the nineteenthcentury myth of the “Greek Miracle”ex nihilo. Professor Koenen’s reference to the “increasing number of scholars” [italics added] during the twentieth century injects a spurious notion of progress. In fact, many archaeologists and ancient historians working at the beginning of the twentieth century, such as Sir Arthur Evans and Eduard Meyer and Gordon Childe, were more open to the idea of Egyptian and Levantine influences on Greece than have been more recent professionals. Colin Renfrew’s early work is only an extreme example of such modern isolationism.14 The fact that Professor Koenen himself comes from the Cologne school of classicists complicates matters. For some decades this school has been exceptionally open to the idea of Near Eastern influences on Ancient Greece. Strikingly, Walter Burkert and Martin West, whose openmindedness was mentioned above, have both been in contact with this school. Their teacher Reinhold Merkelbach was a great authority on Greek and Roman mystery cults, an area of classics in which overt



6 BLACK ATHENA
Oriental influences are so overwhelming that they cannot be avoided. Koenen is in the spirit of this school when he emphasizes or focuses on the orientalizing period, 750–650 BCE. Koenen, Merkelbach, West and Burkert all play down the role of Egypt. Nevertheless, all are convinced that it is impossible to understand Greek culture in isolation. Until recently, the Cologne School’s work on oriental influences has been marginalized, even though its members have been impeccably trained. Now, in response to external pressure, their work is being placed at the center of the discipline as evidence of its long-term openmindedness.
ANATHEMA FROM A G.O.M.
Let me provide an instance of this reaction. Early in 1995 (the last year of his life), Paul O. Kristeller, the grand old man (G.O.M.) of Renaissance history, turned his attention to Black Athena.15 Kristeller was a man of such great age and eminence that, unlike other reviewers, he saw no need to pull his punches. I believe, therefore, that his criticism is particularly significant because he could express openly what many senior classicists feel but prefer not to state in public. Needless to say, Professor Kristeller did not like my work. He saw it as “full of gross errors of fact and interpretation.” He did not, however, provide any examples, preferring to stick to generalities. “Above all” he was appalled by my “extremely poor” scholarly credentials in classics, since I was a specialist in Chinese. He went on to list six of his own teachers, who were leading scholars of the early twentieth century. This approach neatly illustrates a point made to me in a personal letter from Noam Chomsky. Chomsky wrote that he was happy to be working at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) among scientists because—among other things—when faced with a new idea, their first question is “does it work?” Scholars in the humanities, on the other hand, tend to ask “who are you? what are your credentials? who taught you?”16 I think Chomsky’s distinction is overdrawn. Scientists, too, are concerned with credentials and I have been impressed by the number of classicists and ancient historians who have tried to assess the ideas set out in Black Athena Volumes 1 and 2 using the criterion of efficacy. Furthermore, it is far more difficult to tell what “works” in the humanities than it is in the natural sciences. Nevertheless, as Kristeller illustrated, Chomsky’s distinction is well worth making.



INTRODUCTION 7
Kristeller’s second point was that all his teachers in Germany in the 1920s emphasized the significance of such Oriental influences as Egyptian influences on Greek art, the Phoenician origin of the alphabet and eastern—“more Mesopotamian than Egyptian”—influences on Greek astronomy.17 He was not convinced by the claims of “later” (HellenisticRoman and early Christian) writers on the effect of Egyptian thought on Greek theology and philosophy. Apparently unaware of recent scholarship showing their deep roots in Egyptian religion and their immediate Egyptian precedents, he dismissed the “Greek” Hermetica as “forgeries of a much later period.”18 Professor Kristeller’s greatest scorn was reserved for my linguistic arguments. He began by slightly exaggerating my position: “Bernal makes much of the claim that of the Greek classical vocabulary, only one third was of Indo-European origin. . . . ” In fact, I have always maintained that it is almost 40 percent. He continued, “Yet [Bernal] does not tell us what these sources were.” I do repeatedly state that the sources were largely Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic. Similarly, Kristeller asserts “He [Bernal] gives no evidence whatsoever for this statement.” In fact, I have provided enough examples for linguists to publish three scholarly articles about them.19 Kristeller then provided a splendid instance of the “it’s not true, and if it were it wouldn’t matter” argument. He stated, “I have nowhere found such evidence [of foreign loans] and I am convinced that no such evidence exists. Yet even if this opinion were true it is irrelevent to the problem.” Kristeller’s reserve or fallback position was simply the assertion, for which he gave no grounds, that “only words with a concrete meaning were generally used” in early Greek. This volume shows how strenuously I contest this claim. Therefore, Kristeller continued, “what matters was the acquiring of new and abstract meanings, which was largely achieved by the use of purely Greek prefixes and suffixes.” As I hope to show in this volume, many prefixes, including the prepositions kata “down” and syn- “with” as well as such suffixes as -de “toward,” -then “from” and -eus “the one who,” are not Indo-European and may well be Afroasiatic. Nevertheless, most prepositions are certainly of Indo-European origin and I readily concede that many new terms using these prepositions were invented in Greek and that these transformed the language. In the earlier volumes I have already indicated, however, that a number of centrally important abstract words—such as kudos “sacred,” sophia “wisdom,” time@ “honor” and makarios “blessed”—have plausible



8 BLACK ATHENA
Afroasiatic etyma and lack Indo-European competitors. I shall propose these etymologies and many others in this volume. Kristeller went on to give an accurate picture of the attitude of conventional classical philologists of the twentieth century: “The rich modern literature on Greek (and Latin) vocabulary gives no evidence of any external source.”20 Unlike archaeologists and art historians, pure classicists, especially philologists, have always tended to be narrow-minded regarding influences on the Aegean from the south and east. Like Kristeller, they have been uncomfortable with the idea that substantial sectors of Greek religion and philosophy came from Egypt and the Levant. Above all, they want to reject any notion that the Greek language could have been substantially influenced, let alone modified, by Egyptian or Semitic. Language is central to classics.21 As by far the most difficult aspect of the discipline, it is seen as a sine qua non, the touchstone of the competent scholar. Language is also central to classics because the discipline was founded in the heat and passion of the early romantic period (18151830) when language was seen as the soul or distinctive essence of a people. In many ways this view still prevails. Romanticism is also acutely concerned with authenticity, seen as purity and frequently associated with the notion of “race.” Thus, the new classicists of the early nineteenth century found intolerable previous beliefs that the Greek language was in any way mixed, let alone influenced by “racially inferior” Egyptians and “Semites.” In late nineteenth-century China some conservative reformers used the slogan Zhongxue wei ti Xixue wei yong “Chinese studies as the essential, western studies as the practice [or technique].” According to this slogan, it was right to import western practices or techniques (yong) but it was even more important to preserve the Chinese essence (ti).22 In general, nineteenth- and twentieth-century classicists and humanists, have felt a similar urge to preserve what they see as the essential authenticity of the culture to which they are so deeply attached. The more broadminded are well represented by Professor Kristeller in his willingness to accept that technical borrowings took place. He and they, however, draw the line at the idea that any Near Eastern influence could have affected the “soul” of Greece: its religion, philosophy and, above all, language. The only exception to the last being the admission that Phoenicians introduced “practical” Semitic etymologies for the names of spices and



INTRODUCTION 9
other trade goods to Greece. A possibility considered appropriate for a “trading people.” In fact, as the course of modern Chinese history has shown, no neat dichotomy exists between ti and yong. To the extent that it useful to postulate such a distinction at all, the ti and yong are always hopelessly entangled with each other. Furthermore, in his insistence on the fundamental independence of the Greek language Kristeller confuses authenticity with autochthony. Koenen saw the situation much more clearly when he stated:
we . . . get a better sense of what the Greeks owe to others, and we better comprehend how they used foreign concepts productively, making them building blocks of their own culture. Originality lies rarely in the grand idea, born out of nothing in the brain of a genius; it more often develops from the reworking of a concept received from others.23
I could not agree more. Until very recently, however, Koenen’s view did not represent that of the majority of classicists. Most in his field were, and remain, a deeply emotional attachment to the image of the essential autochthony and purity of Ancient Greece. Only this attachment can explain why scholars have assumed that its two most powerful linguistic neighbors, Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic, should not have massively influenced the Greek language. This observation takes us back to the three responses to Black Athena listed near the beginning of this introduction: that the historiography was more or less all right, the archaeology was dubious and the language was crazy. For classicists and ancient historians, the stakes are relatively low on historiography. Although historiographical conclusions can be uncomfortable, these specialists believe that they can take them or leave them and continue their “practical” or “real” history without being affected by such challenges. Accepting a new archaeological approach is more difficult but the previously isolationist archaeologists can salvage their pride by attacking my lack of method. Language is the old classics’ last bastion from which the only possible retreat is the fallback suggested by Kristeller, which he and most traditional philologists are extremely loath to take. Denial of the possibility of substantial Greek linguistic borrowings from Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic becomes totally unreasonable



10 BLACK ATHENA
when one accepts three propositions: (1) Nineteenth- and twentieth-century philologists were ideologically blinkered against the possibility of substantial linguistic loans from Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic into Greek. (2) A consensus has emerged among contemporary archaeologists that contacts around the East Mediterranean were close during certain periods in the Bronze and Early Iron ages. (3) Over half the Greek vocabulary is inexplicable in terms of Indo-European. Given the geographical proximity, the known contacts and the immense span of time—approximately three thousand years—it would be extraordinary if there had not been massive linguistic exchange among the three great cultures and if the predominant flow should not have from the older, richer and more elaborate civilizations of the southeast toward the northwest.
OUTLINE OF VOLUME 3
Given developments in all fields concerned and my general malleability, it is not surprising that this book is different from the one outlined twenty years ago in Volume 1. In the first place, I originally planned for two chapters on documents and archaeology, but they exploded to become Volume 2 with more than 700 pages. Thus, Volume 3 is devoted to language alone. I will now describe its structure. From the beginning, I was faced with a fundamental organizational problem: Should the book be built on the known and accepted, then proceed from the certain to the probable, and from there to the plausible, ending at the merely speculative? Alternatively, should the structure be chronological? Chronology inevitably involved moving from the unknown, or scarcely known, most ancient periods to the more recent and more easily accessible. I chose a chronological scheme for two reasons: the aesthetic appeal of the narrative through time and the close links between causality and time. Therefore, before coming to the work’s core, the linguistic influences of Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic upon Greek, I look wider and more deeply into the putative language hyper-family “Nostratic” to which all three languages may belong. From there I go on to the accepted superfamily Afroasiatic, which includes Egyptian and Semitic and the IndoEuropean family, including Greek. It should be emphasized from the start that the following sections only form an outline. The chapters themselves contain many issues and much material not included in this summary. The first chapter is concerned with historical linguistics and ideas



INTRODUCTION 11
about language contacts. Historical linguistics began with the working out of the Indo-European language family and that family has remained central to the field in two major ways. First, although much work has been done on other language families, Indo-European is explicitly or implicitly taken as the point of reference and model for the reconstruction of proto-languages and the overwhelming majority of reconstructive examples are taken from Indo-European. The second, more profound, effect of Indo-European studies on historical linguistics is the focus on the genetic model itself. The terms “family” and “genetic relationship” suggest permanence and propriety and the most common image or diagram for a language family took—and still takes—the form of a tree. Historical linguistics betrays its early nineteenth century origins in this preference. Romantics loved, and love, trees because they are both living and stable, rooted in their own soil. Furthermore, although they grow and ramify, they generally do not grow into or mix with other trees but retain a single stem fitting the image of purity. Transhistorical reasons also exist for this preference. In most cultures the oak, ramifying from a single acorn and trunk, is pleasing aesthetically. Compared to other models the tree is easy to comprehend. Although the philologists have not used it in this way, an actual tree provides a better model if one does not stop at the stem but considers the multiple roots. Some Caribbean writers have tried to convey this concept with the word rhizome, the Greek word for “root.” As John Milton wrote, “new presbyter is but old priest writ large,” so one could say that root and rhizome amount to the same thing. In modern botany, however, rhizome is used for “rootstock” and in particular for the tangled web of mangroves, which many Caribbean intellectuals see as a more appropriate image for their culture than that of a large tree with a single stem. Here we face a good example of the general contradiction between accuracy and coherence. To my mind, a mangrove swamp provides a more accurate model of human cultures, so intermixed with each other, than does an oak. The mangrove, however, lacks the tree’s coherence and explicability. The attempt to describe the complex Caribbean culture in terms of a transplanted African tree has rightly been displaced by a picture of multiple intertwining rhizomes. In other cases, however, the advantages of coherence outweigh those of accuracy and enough overall unity has been imposed on a particular language for it to be conveniently seen as a tree with a trunk, although always with multiple roots. I put Egyptian, West Semitic and Greek in this last category. In



12 BLACK ATHENA
many other cases, however, the permeability of cultures makes the model of the mangrove swamp more appropriate.
Macro-historical linguistics
Scholars who self-consciously want to transcend Indo-European and other recognized language families also use the tree model. Chapter 2 covers this topic. Thus scholars have proposed hyper- or super-families. The most generally accepted and most relevent super-family is Afroasiatic, previously known as Hamito-Semitic or Semito-Hamitic. This huge range of languages includes the following families: Semitic, spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea as well as in southwest Asia; Chadic, Hausa and other languages around and to the west of Lake Chad; Berber, the original languages of northwest Africa still spoken in its mountains and remote oases; East Cushitic, Somali and related languages; Central Cushitic, the language of parts of Ethiopia; South Cushitic spoken by scattered groups in Kenya; and Omotic, spoken in southwest Ethiopia. Some branches are made up of single languages: Beja, spoken between the Nile and the Red Sea, and Ancient Egyptian. Linguists have discovered enough common features among all these branches to postulate a single, though very ancient, ancestral language. Other linguists have found even larger super-families, such as Niger-Congo stretching from Senegal to Swaziland. Casting their nets even more widely, they have discerned a Nilo-Saharan family scattered across northern Africa with very few common features indeed. Since the late nineteenth century, attempts to establish genetic links between Indo-European and other language families have appeared sporadically. Their nonacceptance by mainstream Indo-Europeanists is overdetermined. At an ideological level any such connections would infringe on Indo-European purity and at a methodological one the attempts require imprecisions not tolerable to men and women working within the tight elegance of a single language family. The first attempt linked Semitic and Indo-European. The externalist or ideological reason for this was the belief—common in the midnineteenth century—that the Indo-European and Semitic “races” were the only ones that contributed to the progress of humanity. The internalist reasons were the facts that verbal roots in both families were based on triple consonants and that the large number of plausible cognate, or apparently related, words are found in both.



INTRODUCTION 13
Interest in this connection faded with the rise of anti-Semitism and, especially, after the relationship between Semitic and some purely African languages was established in the Afroasiatic family. Some scholars have continued to envisage the Nostratic hyper-family and see IndoEuropean and Afroasiatic, as a whole, as related. In the last forty years, however, interest in another hyper-family “Euroasiatic” has increased. Core members of this family include Indo-European; Uralic (Finnish, Hungarian and other northern Eurasian languages); Altaic (Turkish, Mongol etc.); Tungus (Manchu); Korean; and Japanese, Ainu and Inuit. Some scholars also include Kartvelian (Georgian and related languages), Northwest Caucasian (Abkhaz) and Dravidian (Southern India) in this hyper-family. A political motive for setting up this grouping was to establish a language family that encompassed the extraordinarily varied linguistic mosaic in the Soviet Union. It was found that, although these language families shared fewer similar words than did Indo-European and Afroasiatic, the morphology or case systems and verbal patterns of Indo-European, Uralic and Altaic showed striking resemblances not found elsewhere. For many reasons linguists preferred to rely on these, rather than lexical, similarities. Despite the utility of the tree model in explaining relationships within and beyond language families, this model of development can be especially misleading for historical linguistics. To take one of the best known and most thoroughly studied trees of this kind: many of the features of the Romance languages can be explained as divergences from the vulgar Latin of the Roman Empire. On the other hand, understanding of other aspects of individual languages requires some knowledge of the languages spoken in the various provinces before the arrival of Latin. This understanding is usually extremely difficult to obtain. Even more important, one needs to take into account the linguistic effect on the former Roman provinces of the languages of neighbors or conquerors: Slavs on Romanian; Goths, Arabs and Greeks on Italian; Franks on French; and Arabs and Berbers on Spanish and Portuguese. If this caution is necessary for the recent, massively attested and geographically compact Romance “family,” it is even more important for the majority of language families that are older and more widespread. Dominated by the origins of their discipline and frightened of the imprecision and uncertainty that come from leaving the tree model, traditional historical linguists have a great distrust of nongenetic linguistic contact. The discipline’s vocabulary shows this distrust. For example,



14 BLACK ATHENA
the term used for the adoption of a word from one language to another is “borrowing.” “Borrowing” and “lending” are—if we are to believe Shakespeare’s platitudinous Polonius—undesirable activities with sordid commercial connotations. They add confusion and “dirt” in its fundamental sense of “misplaced matter.” What is more, loans are meant to be temporary. In fact, of course, loaned words cannot be returned and they usually last as long in the “borrowing” language as native terms. To the early nineteenth-century German linguists who first coined the term Entlehnung “borrowing” or “loan” such words did appear to be temporary and unnatural. Those linguists tried to transform the German language by replacing words of French or Latin origin with terms constructed from “authentic” Teutonic roots.24 Over the last twenty years, the study of language contacts and mixture has become more fashionable. Approaches have varied but share various features. The most important commonality is the conviction that languages are not autonomous entities but social creations spoken by living populations. Therefore, linguistic contact is a reflection of social contact. A corollary is that, while similarity of language, such as that between English and German, may ease borrowings from one language to another, the social and cultural relations between the two groups of speakers form the determining factor. Thus, for instance, substantial cultural contact over many centuries has led to massive Chinese influence on the Japanese lexicon, even though the two languages are completely unrelated. In addition, different types of contact affect different aspects of the language. When, for example, speakers of one language abandon their own and take on another they tend to learn new words but retain old habits of pronunciation and grammatical structure. Examples can be found in the pidgins of New Guinea and Melanesia, where the vocabulary is almost entirely derived from English or other colonial languages but the structure and pronunciation are completely local. Similarly, IrishEnglish contains very few Gaelic words, yet the old language has deeply affected the intonation and syntax of the newer one. Conversely, the languages of politically, culturally or economically dominant groups tend to affect the lexicons of subordinate societies more than their morphologies or syntaxes. Swahili is full of Arabic words but still has a fully Bantu grammar and morphology. Japanese has retained its elaborate inflection despite the saturation of its vocabulary by words from Chinese, which has a completely different grammatical structure.



INTRODUCTION 15
Chapter 3 of this volume focuses on Africa. It is concerned with the early development of agriculture on the continent and the relation of this process to Joseph Greenberg’s scheme of the four great African language families: Khoisan, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Congo and Afroasiatic. While Greenberg concentrates on the last, he is also concerned with Afroasiatic lexical contacts with other families. In Chapter 3 a number of published hypotheses about the region of origin, or Urheimat, and subsequent spread of Afroasiatic are set out. These include one that sets the Urheimat in the Levant. The majority of scholars place it in North Africa, although many differ over the location. I argue for southern Ethiopia on two principles: the greatest regional diversity of Afroasiatic languages and language families is found here and because I see Afroasiatic as having borrowed the Central Khoisan grammatical structure of sex-linked gender. Thus, at a fundamental level, I see Afroasiatic as “Khoisanized” Nostratic. This chapter also includes specific discussions of Egyptian and Semitic, the two language families with the closest interactions with Greek. In this consideration of Semitic, I have changed my earlier view that it originated near the territory in southern Ethiopia now inhabited by speakers of the Gurage languages. I now, much more conventionally, place the Urheimat of Semitic at the southern end of the Red Sea, on either the African or the Arabian side. I see Semitic speakers as then having spread across what is now the Arabian Desert, but much of which was savanna during the Holocene after the last Ice Age. Entering Mesopotamia from the south, Semitic went on to Syria and the Levant. Ancient Egyptian gives every indication of being a mixed language. Even allowing for the inability of the scripts in which it was written to express vowels, its morphology was far less elaborate than those of other Afroasiatic language families, notably Semitic. Its syntax was, therefore, proportionately more demanding. Mixture is also indicated by two contrasting features. On the one hand, Egyptian shared with Semitic and Berber a system of triconsonantal roots, which were significantly less frequent in the other Afroasiatic language families. On the other hand, judging from its lexicon, Ancient Egyptian is closest to the Chadic branch of Afroasiatic. After considering other hypotheses of its origin, I propose that the Egyptian language and culture came from two sources: first, from the western Sahara, hence the Chadic parallels, and, second, from Proto-Semitic-Berber, which had spread through southwest Asia and across northern Africa.



16 BLACK ATHENA
Throughout the more than three thousand years of its history, Ancient Egyptian culture was acutely conscious of the duality of Upper (the Nile Valley) and Lower Egypt (the Delta). This division partly resulted from different geographical environments. It may also derive, however, from reflexes of the two linguistic and cultural sources. While both descend from Afroasiatic, they each developed significant grammatical and lexical distinctions.
In Chapter 4, I discuss the origins of both Indo-European and the larger family to which it belongs, Indo-Hittite. This larger family includes both Indo-European, in the narrow sense, and its earliest branch, the Anatolian languages of which Hittite is the best known. The Georgian linguist Thomas V. Gamkrelidze and his colleague the Russian Vjac*eslav V. Ivanov place the Urheimat of Indo-Hittite in eastern Anatolia, thus explaining Kartvelian or Georgian parallel words in Proto-Indo-Hittite (PIH) and Proto-Indo-European (PIE). For detailed reasons given in Chapter 4, I prefer to follow Colin Renfrew in seeing PIH as associated with the ancient agricultural region of the plain of Konya in central Anatolia, best known for the famous site of Çatal Hüyük. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov propose a number of loans from other languages notably Kartvelian and Semitic into PIH and PIE, or exchanges between them. I find most of these acceptable as they explain a number of parallels between words widespread in both Indo-European and Afroasiatic that cannot plausibly be attributed to Nostratic. I end Chapter 4 considering the possibility that Indo-European borrowed a pattern of sex-linked gender from Semitic. None of the other Euroasiatic languages have this pattern. For these others, the predominant binary is animate/inanimate. Indo-European retains the latter as the neuter gender, something absent from Afroasiatic, while splitting the animate into male and female. My argument is based on the rare structural parallels and also on the predominant feminine suffix in Indo-European -a@, which seems to be found in the early northern Semitic language of Eblaite.
Afroasiatic languages and the formation of Greek
Chapters 5 to 7 have the overall title “The Greek language in the Mediterranean context.” The first of these chapters, on phonology, is largely negative, in that the phonological alterations that took place between



INTRODUCTION 17
PIE and the earliest Greek can largely be explained as internal developments, without recourse to Afroasiatic influences. Furthermore, where similar changes, such as that from initial s- to initial h- or the breakdown of labiovelars, took place in both Greek and nearby Afroasiatic languages the Greek shift seems to have been earlier. On the other hand, Afroasiatic clearly influenced the distribution of phonemes in Greek through lexical loans. For instance, the frequency of the uniquely Greek medial -ss-, -tt- was greatly increased by renditions of the Semitic /s/` plausibly reconstructed as /ts/. The very high number of Greek words beginning with p- can be explained by the many borrowings of Egyptian words incorporating the prefixes pÅ “the” and pr “house.” Even more importantly, a high number of prothetic, or initial, vowels occur in Greek. It is generally agreed that all PIE words began with a consonant. Nevertheless, most Indo-European languages have prothetic vowels either deriving from initial consonental clusters that were difficult to pronounce or from traces of lost PIE “laryngeals” *H1,H2,H3,etc. prob
ably resembling * h, hy,  ̇, ∆, œ, g (not necessarily in that order). The inordinate number of prothetic vowels in Greek can be explained as the result of borrowings from Egyptian and Semitic words beginning with ’aleph or ‘ayin.
Chapter 6 is concerned with morphology and syntax. As stated above, Greek morphology is undoubtedly fundamentally Indo-European. One or two forms do, however, indicate Afroasiatic influence. Decades ago, Saul Levin demonstrated that the oblique dual endings -oiin, -aiin derived from the West Semitic dual -ayim. From the Egyptian agental suffix -w comes the Greek -eus; “the one who.” As for syntax, I argue that a number of the key syntactical terms in Greek, kai “and” as well as the crucial, but difficult to define, particles gar and oun lack Indo-European etymologies but have plausible derivations from Egyptian. Even more important is the definite article, deriving from a reduced demonstrative. This form originated in Upper Egypt around the beginning of the Second Millennium BCE and spread by “calquing” (taking the idea and applying it to native roots) to West Semitic, Greek and, hence, most European languages. With Chapter 7, I reach the central theme of the book, lexicon. In the conventional view of the formation of the Greek language, which I call the Aryan Model, the language resulted when Indo-Europeanspeaking Hellenes conquered the mysterious Pre-Hellenes, who, though viewed as “racially” European, could not have spoken an Indo-European



18 BLACK ATHENA
language. This last point is needed to explain the large number of Greek words and even larger number of proper nouns without Indo-European etymologies. It has been proposed that these words were the remnants of the pre-Hellenic substrate. This explanation is plausible for placenames, which are often preserved after the advent of a new language. Such influence is less plausible for the vocabulary. The most frequent pattern is for the substrate to affect the phonetics and grammar of the new language rather than to introduce new words into it. While making some modifications, I accept the conventional view that almost 40 percent of the Greek vocabulary is Indo-European. From this base, I go on to challenge the belief that most of the rest derive from lost “pre-Hellenic” languages. Instead, I claim that a further 40 percent are loans from Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic. The modifications I propose to the Indo-European component of the Greek vocabulary involve Armenian and Latin. If the only Indo-European cognate to a Greek word is found in Armenian or Latin, it should be scrutinized with extreme care. The general belief that Armenian has a special genetic relationship within Indo-European has recently been seriously challenged. It should further be noted that the Armenian language was only first attested in the fifth century CE, when most of the early texts were religious translations, sometimes literally taken from the Greek. Armenian also borrowed from Aramaic and Syriac. Thus, parallels between Greek and Armenian words need not be genetic but can be the result of loans or common borrowings from Semitic. Latin and Greek come from different branches of Indo-European. The Romans, however, took massively from Greek culture in all respects including vocabulary. It is, at the same time, clear that both Greek and Latin borrowed heavily from Semitic, and, more surprisingly, that Egyptian words also occur in Latin. Thus, similarities between Greek and Latin terms that are not direct loans are not necessarily genetic cognates; they can also be common borrowings from Afroasiatic.
Chapter 8 begins with a discussion of the criteria by which one should assess the plausibility of proposed Greek etymologies from Afroasiatic. On the phonetic side, one should find three parallel consonants in the same order. While the semantic criteria are less precise, they require equal or more attention. Naturally, an Indo-European etymology weakens or destroys the possibility of an Afroasiatic one. This weakness, however, can also depend on the strength of the genetic claim.



INTRODUCTION 19
In looking for parallels one must consider sound shifts in the three languages. Most of Chapter 8 consists of a survey of phonetic changes in Semitic and Egyptian in the last three millennia BCE and the ways in which at different periods they were interpreted differently by Greeks. As well as providing evidence on the plausibility of borrowing, sound shifts in Semitic and Egyptian can provide information about the date of borrowing. For instance in Semitic, around the middle of the Second Millennium, the phoneme /t2¢/ merged with /s∫/. Thus the city name T¢or became S¢or as it still is in Hebrew. In Greek, however, the name remained Tyros, Tyre. Thus, Greeks must have learned the name before 1500 BCE. At about that time the Canaanite /g!/ ghayin merged with /Œ/ Œayin. In Hebrew, the southern coastal city we know as Gaza, is Œazzåh, indicating that the Greeks, from whom we gain the name, knew about it before that shift. Egyptian sound shifts also resulted in different Greek renditions of
the same “letter.” The two most significant of these were ß conven
tionally rendered /ß/ and a /Å/ “double aleph.” Judging from
Afroasiatic parallels, it is now clear that ß was originally pronounced /∆/ and that it shifted to /ß/ sometime in the Third Millennium. Thus, it is interesting to find a number of Greek words beginning with c- or kfor which plausible etymologies exist from Egyptian terms with initial ß-. Such loans would have to be extremely early, possibly introduced before the arrival of the Hellenes or preserved in Cretan languages. After this shift, Greek lacking the phoneme /ß/ sometimes rendered it as /cq/ and later still as /x/ or simply /s/.
The development of a /Å/ is equally interesting. From Afroasiatic parallels and Egyptian transcriptions of Semitic names and terms, we know that it was generally pronounced as a liquid /r/ or /l/ into the second half of the Second Millennium. After that, it merely modified vowels, rather as the medial and final “received” British /r/ and /l/ have done: farm-fa@m, calf-ca@f etc. If the earlier consonantal value is taken into account, a very large number of Greek words without IndoEuropean etymologies can plausibly be provided from Egyptian. The last section of Chapter 8 is concerned with what I see as a pattern by which an Egyptian /m/ was rendered /f/ in Greek. This change did not result from a sound shift. Rather, the semantically controlled examples seem to illustrate the slippage from one to the other, which is common in many languages.

Chapter 9 is primarily concerned with the definite articles masculine pÅ, feminine tÅ and plural nÅ ny. These articles became so firmly attached to the nouns they modified that they were borrowed together, much as European languages accepted alchemy, alchohol, algebra and alcove with the Arabic definite article >al , as part of the word. In this chapter, I also discuss the roles of the Egyptian pr “house,” and the locative r- in Greek borrowings, particularly of place and personal names. Middle Egyptian did not feature definite articles. These articles are in fact the type markers of Late Egyptian; they only became standard throughout Egypt in the second half of the Second Millennium. Late Egyptian, however, is as old as, or older than, Early Greek. Mycenaean Greece was largely contemporaneous with the Egyptian Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Thus, many examples of definite articles could well have been borrowed into Greek in the Bronze Age. The last section of Chapter 9 contains an annotated list of words taken into Greek from Egyptian and beginning with the causative prefix (r)dˆ.
Chapters 10 and 11 are concerned with some terms for central concepts in Egyptian culture, some of which were borrowed into Greek many times. In Chapter 10 these include ntr, “growth, divinity” with some compounds sntr “to make holy” and *kÅ ntr “holy spirit”; kÅ “spirit” or “double”; Œn∆; “life”; sbÅ; “star, astronomy, wisdom”; dr; “limit, goal”; mÅ Œt, “balance, fate”; and ∆pr “to become, impermanence.” Chapter 11 is devoted to only two Egyptian terms. The first is nfr “beautiful, young,” which with the plural definite article nÅ ny nfrw provides a good etymology for Nymphai “nymphs.” The second is msˆ “birth, child, midwife.” This term is generally acknowledged to be the origin of the Hebrew name Moses but I argue that it is also the source of the Greek Mousai “Muses.” This chapter also contains a study of the parallel iconographical sequence from images of Thueris, the hippopotamus goddess of childbirth, to the Minoan and Mycenaean genii to the Archaic half-wasp, half-nymph and on to Hesiod’s vivid description of the Muses. In these and other examples of Afroasiatic loans, cited below, in which there is an Indo-European competitor, I discuss the latter in the text but not in this introduction.
The title of Chapter 12 is “Minor Roots. . . . ” These roots are only “minor” in comparison to those discussed in the previous two chapters. They include some roots that provide central terminology for Greek



INTRODUCTION 21
society and politics and, hence, those of modern Europe: ˆsw “ fair reward” the origin of the Greek prefix iso- “equal”;  ̇tr “bind together, yoke,” which leads to both hetairos “companion” and heteros “other of two,” and dmˆ “town, village” and dmˆ w “fellow citizens” leading to de@mos “people.” Nmˆ in Middle Egyptian means “to travel.” Interestingly it is often
written with the sign of the “winding wall” #, which, whether pronounced as nm or mr, is associated with cattle. It is also used, for instance, in nmˆ “to low like cattle.” The sign also appears in some writings of nmˆw ßŒ “Bedouin, sand farers.” The association with cattle occurs indiscriminately in words with nm, mr or mn. Mnˆ is “to be a herdsman” and mnˆw were “herdsmen.” This “winding wall” sign associated with cattle, boundaries and nomadism fits well with the basic sense of the Greek verb nemo@ “to allocate cattle lands” and the nouns nomas- nomas- nomados “nomad” and nomos “law.”
With Chapter 13 we turn to the Semitic contribution to the Greek vocabulary. The first consideration is of proposed loans from West Semitic into Greek beginning with s-. Most words in this category simply render s- for s-. Complications occur on both sides. First, there is the Greek shift s->h-; second, there is the rendition of the Canaanite ß- as sk-, skhand khs-. Accepting these allows one to explain previously inexplicable semantic bundles. For example, the Canaanite ÷ßll/h “spoil, plunder” appears to have as its basic meaning “to flay an animal” or “to strip the bark from a tree,” as found in the Arabic sala∆a. In Greek one finds not only sylao@ “to strip the arms from an enemy, pillage,” but also a cluster around skyllao@ “pillage” and skula “arms taken from a beaten enemy.” Xylon in Greek means “brushwood, wood used for construction,” and xéo@is “to scrape, scratch, polish.” If the word had been borrowed before 1500 BCE the s- would have become h-, and indeed one finds hyle@“brushwood, wood that has been cut down for fuel.” Several other similar clusters are described. The second section of Chapter 13 is concerned with words originating from the Afroasiatic fricative lateral /Ò/, resembling the Welsh /ll/. This form survives today in some South Arabian languages and clearly persisted in Canaanite as /s!/ well into the First Millennium BCE and later still in Arabic. Non-Semitic speakers heard it alternatively as /ls/, /s/ or simply /l/. The best known example of the first is the Hebrew word bås!åm rendered balsamon “balsam” in Greek. The other two alter



22 BLACK ATHENA
nations can explain semantic clusters beginning with s- or l-. For example, the Canaanite root ÷s!p ̇, later ÷sp ̇ “bark, skin, thin cover, eruption, scab.” This single source has two Greek stems: the first around se@pomai “to make rotten, mortify” (from which our “sepsis”). The second is lepo@ “scale” and lepros (from which “leprosy”). The third section of Chapter 13 focuses on terms in which the initial s- has been “sheltered” by a following /p/. The first of three examples given here is the cluster including speudo@ “zealous,” sphodra “vehement” and spodos “ash.” These apparently disparate meanings can be derived from the single concept of mourning, and the Canaanite ÷spd means “to mourn, wail, smite the breast.”
This book is not concerned with previously accepted Semitic etymologies in Greek, those concerned with exotics and especially with material luxuries. Therefore, in Chapter 14, I consider fourteen plausible Semitic origins for Greek nouns of centrally important semantic clusters. These contain such concepts as “ falsehood, truth, beauty, sacred”; such objects as “bronze, temple”; and the most frequent verbs for “to do, come, go, and talk.”
With Chapter 15 the focus of the volume shifts from phonetic correspondences and Greek developments of important Egyptian and Semitic terms to semantic clusters. It is helpful to establish these to show that suggested etymologies are not random isolates but can be seen as elements in a wider environment. This, in turn, enhances the plausibility of each individual proposal. Inevitably this section overlaps some with items that have been discussed previously. As far as possible, this is handled by cross-referencing to the relevant footnotes in other chapters. Chapter 15 is an attempt to look at Egyptian etymologies equivalent to the type of practical material terms that have been widely accepted as coming from Semitic. The first section is headed “agriculture” and includes marshes, reeds and grass; bushes, trees and fruits; cultivation; livestock; birds; and implements and containers. Other sections concern cooking and medicine. A number of these loans, however, have been abstracted to more fundamental concepts. For instance, the Egyptian wrwmt “awning, roof ” may have led in Greek to both Ouranos [Uranus] and Olympos and dqrw “fruit” or “date” provides a plausible origin for daktylos “finger.”



INTRODUCTION 23
Where Chapter 15 is exclusively concerned with Egyptian etymologies, all later chapters cover etymologies from both Egyptian and Semitic. They are in semantic areas in which the search for Greek etymologies from any Afroasiatic language has been severely discouraged, if not forbidden. Chapter 16 covers terms concerning warfare, hunting and shipping. Objections to proposed Afroasiatic loans in these semantic fields has been particularly fierce. For example, the proposed derivation, of xiphos, the most common Greek word for sword, from the Egyptian sft Coptic sefe “sword” has been challenged on trivial grounds. Similarly, the Semitic etymology for another frequent Homeric word for sword, phasganon, has been systematically neglected. For scholars working in the Aryan Model the idea that these and many other military terms could have come from “Orientals” whom Aristotle had described as “of slavish disposition,” was inherently impossible. The richest family of Greek military terms is that around stratos “camp.” This derives from a development of the Egyptian sdr “to sleep, spend the night,” sdrt “bivouac, camp.” Greeks were supposed to have pioneered navigation. Thus, one finds a reluctance to concede Afroasiatic loans in this semantic field. Two examples demonstrating this are given in the last section of this chapter. While scholars have been willing to accept a Semitic origin for gaulo" “bowl,” they balk at gau'lo" “boat.” Second, scholars accept the derivation of souson “lily” from the Egyptian sßn “lotus” but reject that of souson “ships’ cordage” from sßnw “ropes, cordage.”
Chapter 17 treats society, politics, law, and abstraction. The semantic sphere of “society” is necessarily ill-defined. Nevertheless, Afroasiatic loans include the central term laos “people.” In the early seventeenth century the great Huguenot scholar Samuel Bochart proposed that the Phoenician word found in the Hebrew lE>o\m “people” is the probable origin of the Greek laos “people.” No one has since found a better one. Bochart’s proposal is strengthened by the fact that in epic attestations of laos, the accusative singular and genitive plural forms with a final -n are more frequent than the other cases. The section contains many other proposals such as that the Egyptian wr ˆb, literally “great heart” but meaning “insolent, arrogance,” is the origin of hybris. This etymology involves the one acceptable metathesis, the alternation of liquid between the second and third positions. The



24 BLACK ATHENA
Egyptian root ts means “to tie together, marshal troops.” Tst are “troops, a requisitioned gang of workmen.” The@s /The@tos is a “slave, paid worker, laborer, lowest stratum of citizens.” In Greece today The@teia is “military service.” A standard image in Phoenician art is of a woman looking through a lattice window, symbolizing enclosure. In Hebrew the plural form for lattices is h≥a*raki$m. In Aramaic one finds h≥a*raka( “window.” The Greek herkos is an “enclosure around a house by barrier or wall, net for hunting, etc.” and horkane@ was “prison.” The Semitic loans also include the etyma for the Greek mitilos and mytilos terms referring to both “cutting” and “youth.” A Semitic root ÷btl “sever” is generally assumed. The most common form of this term is batul “virgin” either boy or girl. It is possible that referring to these young people as “cut” suggests male circumcision, which is known to have existed among West Semitic speakers, and female genital mutilation, which may well have done so. Thus, in Semitic, as in Greek and Latin, one finds the double meanings of “youth” and “cutting.” The semantic correspondence more than makes up for the alternation, initial m- for initial b-, a change which is in fact very common. An interesting pattern can be found in plausible Afroasiatic words for the herding, assembling and counting of cattle and other livestock, appearing in Greek as social and political terms for humans. The relation between nomos “law” and nmi “to travel, with cattle” has been described above. In Egypt, iÅwt was a “herd of cattle or humans.” This form provides a plausible etymology for the Ionian and Doric (h)ale@s or aolle@s “assembly.” The Athenian counterpart for this word was athroos “crowd, squeezed together” coming from the Egyptian ˆdr “herd.” Then there is the origin of ethnos from tnw “number” or “numbering,” and tnwt “census of cattle, prisoners etc.” These, together with the Egyptian sources for de¤mos and iso- mentioned above, are among the many Egyptian etyma
for Greek political terms referred to in Chapter 17.
Chapter 18 deals with religious terminology. Etymologies proposed here include (h)ieros “sacred” and (h)iereus “priest” from the Egyptian ˆÅˆ “praise” and ˆÅt, later ˆÅwt, “office, official.” This form may have been contaminated by ˆrˆ “to do, act” and specifically to “act as an official, celebrate a festival.” Another important Greek religious term is hosios “sanctioned by divine law.” Hosio@te@!r was a “perfect animal fit for sacri



INTRODUCTION 25
fice.” The Hosíoi were priest at Delphi who were concerned with such animals, and hosioo@ was to “consecrate”or “purify.” An Egyptian etymology, persuasive on both phonetic and semantic grounds, is from the Egyptian verbs  ̇sˆ “to sing” and  ̇s(z)ˆ “to praise.” The Coptic form ho@s is “to sing, make music, praise.” Still more interesting is the Egyptian  ̇sy, the Coptic hasie or esie “drowned or praised person.” The latter was recorded in Greek as Esie@s, referred to as the “Egyptian for praised dead.” The Egyptian wÅg meant “to shout, a religious festival.” WÅg was clearly related, through palatalization, to wÅd “green, make green, flourish,” used for the Delta after the annual flood. It appears to have been transmitted to Greek at two different periods. The first borrowing, when /Å/ still possessed consonantal value, was as a Greek cluster of words beginning with org-. These words cover remarkably similar semantic fields. Orge@ “passion, anger, temperament,” especially “the changeable moods of women.” Another use of orge@ is found in a hapax that appears to mean “sacred land.” Orgao@ “to be full of sap or vigor” refers to fertile land or growing plants. Orgas was “well watered but generally not cultivated land.” The second borrowing as (hyak) came after the /Å/ had become merely vocalic. With the suffix -nthos from the Egyptian ntr “growth, divinity,” it becomes the Spartan spring festival of Hyakinthia from which the mythical hero Hyakinthos gained his name. The term myste@rion “mystery”comes from Semitic, probably from the root ÷str “hide, veil,” with a nominalizing or localizing prefix m-. The etymology was so obvious that a nineteenth-century German scholar felt obliged to forbid others from even suggesting that myste@rion derived from str.
Chapter 19 is concerned with mythical names, those of gods, strange creatures and heroes. It focuses on the derivation of the name Apollo from Ôprr, the Egyptian god of the sun at dawn. It also treats the names of many other divinities. These are certainly enough to justify Herodotos’s statement that “the names of nearly all the gods came from Egypt.” Plausible Egyptian origins for the names of Greek demigods, heroes and monsters are also listed. It is striking how few of these have Semitic etymologies.
Chapter 20 is devoted to place-names. The first section covers names of islands. Among these are apparently a large number of Semitic



26 BLACK ATHENA
etymologies and rather few Egyptian ones. The balance is more equal when it comes to mountain and river names. The difference would seem to me to be the presence of nautical Phoenicians in the Aegean. Thus, Semitic island names given in the Early Iron Age likely replaced several earlier Indo-Hittite and Egyptian names. The Afroasiatic etymologies of most of the city names mentioned in this chapter were or would be discussed elsewhere. The only substantial argument in this section concerns Corinth, which I derive from the Semitic qryt “city.”
Chapter 21 is about Sparta. The name comes from the Egyptian spÅt “district, district capital.” Those of Lakonia and Lakedaimon are calques in which the initial Lak- derives from lakein “canine behaviour” (gnawing, barking etc.). This connection fits with the fact that the spÅt par excellence in Lower Egypt was associated with the jackal god ˆnpw “Anubis.” Furthermore, -daimo@n “spirit” corresponds with the Egyptian kÅ (ka). Thus, Lakedaimon provides a neat parallel with kÅ inpw—Kano@bos or Canopus, the western branch of the Nile Delta (that closest to Sparta) and in myth the name of the steersman of the Spartan King Menelaos. Other cultic and cultural similarities between Egypt and Sparta are also discussed, including the plausible Late Egyptian etymologies for specifically Spartan social and political terms. These similarities fit with traditions that the Spartan lawgiver Lykourgos gained institutional ideas from his travel to Egypt. Spartan institutions are also clearly similar to Phoenician political institutions. Both Egypt and Phoenicia influenced Lakonia during the Early Iron Age. The Greek Hermes was believed to correspond to two Egyptian gods, Anubis and Thoth. The Anubian aspects of Hermes, Psycho-pompos, leader of souls, were particularly prominent in Sparta. In Chapter 19, I argue that Hermes was associated with the planet Mercury at least as early as the seventh century BCE. Just as the planet’s orbit moved from the “dead” sky of the circling stars to the “live” sky inhabited by the sun, moon and other planets, Hermes/Anubis connected the living with the dead. Many of the complications are considered in Chapter 21, but I conclude that the least unsatisfactory primary etymology for the name Hermes is from the Semitic root  ̇rm /∆rm in the sense “to penetrate, pierce, string together.” Also, cults of Hermes and the entry to death were exceptionally well established in Sparta. The final chapter is on Athens. Previously, I have derived the name



INTRODUCTION 27
of the city and its goddess Athena from Ót Nt, the temple or city of the Egyptian goddess known to the Greeks as Ne@ith. The one serious phonetic problem with this derivation was the length of the middle vowel in Athe@ne@. In response to the critics who have noted this, I have changed the proposed Egyptian etymon Ót Nt to the equally attested forms Ótntr Nt or Ót-ntr nt Nt, “temple or city of Ne@ith.” These were variant names of what was known in secular terms as Sais, which Plato saw to be the sister city of Athens. The massive yet elegant semantic parallels between the Egyptian and Greek goddesses and their cities overwhelm any phonetic complications of this etymology. The two cults can be linked iconographically through the so-called Shield Goddess in Minoan Crete and the armor on a pole of the Palladion. The cults of both goddesses involved the weaving of sacred cloth. Historically, one finds in the sixth century BCE simultaneous promotion of Ne@ith by the pharaoh Amasis reigning from Sais and of Athena by the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos. In the fourth century, Plato described the sisterhood of Sais and Athens and argued that the same goddess had founded both. Because of the many Egyptian etymologies for other terms associated with Athena and her cult, Chapter 22 is long. In concluding this semantic section of the book, I hope to have shown that, although the proposed Afroasiatic loans can be found in many, if not all, spheres of the Ancient Greek language, they are not scattered randomly but fit together in coherent ways. The richness of the Greek language and Greek culture as a whole comes from its incorporation of many sources and by far the most important were those from Egypt and the Levant.



NINETEENTH-CENTURY ROMANTIC LINGUISTICS: THE TREE AND THE FAMILY
N
ineteenth-century historical linguistics established—and was obsessed by—the idea of language “families.” Unlike the eighteenth-century Enlightenment concern with spatial arrangement and classification, nineteenth-century intellectuals were concerned with time and development. As positivist progressives living in the age of capitalist expansion across the world, they believed in increase and ramification in all things, and, as romantics and geographical determinists, they liked to see simple roots nourished by native soils. Thus, the image of a tree growing and spreading through the ages became dominant in the development of species, or “races,” and languages. Above all, they insisted that good languages were organic, growing from the inside, not inorganic, imposed from the outside.1 The standard linguistic terms “loan” and “borrowing” themselves indicate something interesting and important about the early nineteenthcentury romantic scholars who worked out the Indo-European language family. To them, such terms suggested impermanence and distasteful “trade.” “Family” and “genetic relationship,” on the other hand, suggested permanence and propriety. Similarly, the model of a ramifying tree was not only aesthetically attractive and satisfying but it was also able to explain many relationships between and among languages.
HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS AND THE IMAGE

CHAPTER 1



[CH. 1] THE IMAGE OF ANCIENT GREEK 29
This idea leads to the general principle upon which my whole project is organized: there are no simple origins. Thus, imaging historical linguistic or biological development by using the model of a tree, with a single stem from which grow branches and ever smaller branches and twigs, is seldom useful. Only if one takes the multiple roots into account can the tree model sometimes be useful. The past, I believe, is better envisioned as a river in which currents come together to form a unity, then diverge and combine with others to form new unities and so on. The uncertainty of this image should not lead to despair or paralysis. The fact that the chase is endless adds to, rather than detracts from, its fascination.
Early Perceptions of Relations between Languages
Language families were envisioned long before the nineteenth century. Probably even under the Assyrian and Babylonian empires Jews were aware of the obvious relationship between Hebrew and the official language Aramaic. Jews living within Islam added Arabic to the cluster. Judah Halevi (1075–1141 CE) the Andalusian poet who wrote in Arabic and Hebrew, was quite explicit on this relationship. He maintained, in the orthodox way, that Hebrew was the language of God and should, therefore, be used in prayers. He went on to the unorthodox notion that Abraham had spoken Aramaic in everyday life and had taught it to his son Ishmael who had then developed Arabic.2 There was a difficulty here in that Hebrew was seen as the paternal language, whereas Arabic is, in fact, much more archaic. Only after the weakening of JudeoChristian influence on language studies at the end of the nineteenth century was Arabic seen as closer to the original Proto-Semitic than Hebrew. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when Portugal became involved in Ethiopia and the Ethiopian church contacted Rome, the Ethiopian classical liturgical language of Ge’ez was added to the cluster of Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic.3 The outer bounds of the family began to be defined by the Abbé Jean Jacques Barthélemy in the 1760s, when he argued plausibly that, although there were similarities between Coptic and Semitic languages, the Egyptian language did not belong to what he called the “Phoenician” language family.4 In 1781 the Göttingen scholar A. L. Schlötzer gave the scheme academic ratification as the “Semitic”from Noah’s son Shem—language family.5



30 BLACK ATHENA
Earlier in the eighteenth century, a number of other language “families” had been recognized. Malay, Malagasy and Polynesian were seen as related in the family now known as Austronesian. The Uralic family, including Finnish and Hungarian, was also established.6 Most historical linguists consider these discoveries unimportant. For them the crucial step was what is seen as the heroic foundation of IndoEuropean studies: William Jones’s Third Anniversary Discourse to the Royal Asiatic Society at Calcutta in 1786. Jones set out what he saw as the excellence of Sanskrit over its “sister languages” Latin and Greek. He saw all these languages as coming from a common source. In addition, Persian and, with some alterations, both “Gothick” and “Celtick” also derived from this source.7 Like Schlötzer’s establishment of Semitic, Jones’s scheme, too, had antecedents. Medieval and Renaissance scholars had long recognized that in some languages God was called variants of Deus, in others of Gott and still others of Bog, thus defining the Romance, Germanic and Slavic families. By the eighteenth century these three families had been quite thoroughly worked out. As early as the sixteenth century, European priests and other travelers had noticed similarities between Sanskrit and European languages.8 Where Jones went beyond his predecessors was in focusing on similarities of morphology—the conjugational systems of verbs and the declensions of nouns and especially common irregularities—rather than on mere resemblances between words. This emphasis has worked well for closely related languages. Furthermore, to study morphology one needs a thorough training, which benefits the guild of professional linguists by keeping out amateurs. This is an important factor behind the preference of historical linguists for morphology over lexicon. The insistence on the relative unimportance of lexical parallels has hampered attempts to connect more distantly related languages. In fact, common words often outlive morphological parallels. For instance, we know from linguistic history that Russian and English are both members of the Indo-European family. Today, however, the two languages show no morphological parallels. On the other hand, a number of basic words in Russian and English, those for “mother,” “brother,” “son,” “milk” etc. are clearly cognate. Thus, lexical comparison is still an essential tool for relating languages, despite potential confusion caused by chance and the possibility of loaning.



[CH. 1] THE IMAGE OF ANCIENT GREEK 31
The legend of “scientific” linguistics
By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, linguistics had become a well-established academic discipline. As such it required a genealogy. Therefore, German and Scandinavian practitioners established a standard historiography, or hagiography, of the development of “scientific” historical linguistics. According to their scheme, the discipline passed through four stages or generations. The precursers were Sir William Jones and Friedrich Schlegel; the founders were Franz Bopp, Jacob Grimm and Wilhelm von Humboldt. The consolidators included Georg Curtius, August Schleicher and August Fick and the final developers were the Junggrammatiker or Neo-Grammarians, August Leskien, Karl Brugmann, Hermann Osthoff and Berthold Delbruck.9 The list reveals a number of interesting and significant features. First, it consists almost entirely of German men. Apart from Jones, only two other non-Germans are referred to as having played roles that do not fit well in the sequence: the Dane Rasmus Rask and the Italian Graziado Isaia Ascoli. The last is the only scholar whose native language was not Teutonic. In the late twentieth century, the historian of linguistics Hans Aarsleff set up a broader view of the discipline’s origins. Aarsleff argues that the central figure Wilhelm von Humboldt not only spent his formative years in Paris but also drew heavily on the linguistic ideas of French figures of the Enlightenment, especially Ettienne de Condillac, Denis Diderot and Joseph-Marie Degérando.10 The failure to note this influence reveals a desire on the part of the nineteenth-century historians to portray “scientific linguistics” as an essentially Germanic discipline. It also diminishes the role of gentlemen scholars in its development to the benefit of professional academics. The historical linguist and historian of linguistics Anna MorpurgoDavies has described Humboldt as “embarrassing” in two major respects: First, his intermediate relationship between the Enlightenment and the romantic positivists of the nineteenth century and, second, the ambiguity of his position between amateur and professional.11 The second embarrassment is true of the founders of all academic disciplines. The first is the more interesting. In Volume 1 of this series, I sketched out the central role of historical linguistics in the formation of the modern university in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and North America.12 I focused on Humboldt, whom I portrayed as the founder both of the



32 BLACK ATHENA
Prussian—later German—academic system and of modern romanticpositivist linguistics. This view must now be modified in view of Aarsleff ’s work. Humboldt clearly remained part of the Enlightenment in his broad interest in all languages and in his concern with both their diachronichistorical and their synchronic structural aspects. In these respects he was very different from his successors or one might almost say, in some cases, his products. The latter were exclusively concerned with historical linguistics and with the Indo-European language family and very largely with Germanic or classical languages. Humboldt was, however, a romantic in his conviction that inflected Indo-European languages were ineffably superior to all others. For him, Sanskrit was the perfect language and Greek the most harmonious.13 Sanskrit was knocked from its pedestal as the original mother tongue by the professionals in the second half of the nineteenth century, but throughout the twentieth century Greek maintained its unsullied reputation as the most harmonious language in Indo-European and, hence, world languages. The only challenger was Latin, which had preserved more of the nominal cases of PIE than Greek. Nevertheless, despite the German and British identification with Rome, consolidated after 1870 when both claimed to be empires of the Roman type, academics tended to prefer Greek. Jones’s immediate successors were less cautious than he in their family scheme. Where Jones saw Sanskrit, Greek and Latin as “sister” languages descended from a lost parent, German scholars of the mid-nineteenth century tended to see Sanskrit itself as the ancestral language. Only in the 1860s did scholars begin to see that, although the ancient Indian language was archaic in many respects, in others it had made more innovations. Thus, a trend emerged to revert to Jones’s position and give equal or even superior status to Greek and Latin. It should be noted at this point that German historical linguistics did not fit the general progessivism of the nineteenth century and that for the linguists preservation of original features was considered the mark of a superior language. This value influenced German scholars to move away from the name Indoeuropäisch “Indo-European,” proposed by Bopp to Indogermanisch.14 The suggestion was that the Indo-Aryans and the Germans had been the last to leave their supposed Central Asian homeland and had, therefore, preserved the purest form of PIE.



[CH. 1] THE IMAGE OF ANCIENT GREEK 33
The Neo-Grammarians
The scholars who made the decisive shift away from Sanskrit as the mother language were the Neo-Grammarians. At one level the move was forced by the recognition that the vowel system of the European branches was objectively more archaic than that of Sanskrit. On another level this shift was an assumption of European superiority in the decades of imperial or more specifically of Germanic—German and English—triumph over the globe and the final jettisoning of all Oriental influences upon Europe.15 The Neo-Grammarians were described as the final developers of nineteenth-century historical linguistics. Mostly based in Leipzig, they flourished between 1870 and 1900. The epithets “new” or “young” attached to branches of academic disciplines usually indicate continuity rather than the break they wish to indicate. Such continuity was certainly the case with the Neo-Grammarians, who basically only ratified or fixed previous trends. In the previous decades historical linguists had begun to question the maternal role of Sanskrit. Although the Neo-Grammarians claimed to have broken away from their predecessors’ “organicism” (the belief that language was an organism with a life of its own independent of the speaker), they were not, in fact, able to make this break. Furthermore, their own teachers had practiced the positivism they proclaimed.16 The German positivist linguists’ most important model came from Charles Lyell’s “uniformitarian” geology. Lyell’s scheme projected processes observable in the present onto the past and emphasized steady progress and regularity.17 This pattern fit well with men who saw the passage of time in terms of the “Whig Interpretation” of British history, as a smooth upward path from the Glorious Revolution of 1689 to the nineteenth century. Men and women in tumultuous continental Europe tended to perceive development rather differently. During the last twenty years of the twentieth century, their view of irregular or catastrophic development even reached complacent academics in the United States. The Darwinian view of gradual biological development has been challenged by scientists like Stephen J. Gould, who have argued against the steadiness of evolution in favor of punctuated equilibria or rapid leaps followed by level plateaus. As with the issue of isolationism and diffusionism, I believe that one should be open to the possibility that either steady progress or revolutionary change could have taken place in any particular



34 BLACK ATHENA
period. Uniformitarianism and revolutionary change are connected to the contradiction between diffusionism and isolationism: Although the overlap is not complete, gradual evolution tends to be associated with local development and rapid change is often associated with diffusion, especially that of the genocidal type.
Problems with the Neo-Grammarian scheme
Let us explore the question of the originality of the Junggrammatiker. Even what is generally considered to be their greatest contribution, Die Ausnahmslosigkeit der Lautgesetze “the exceptionessless of sound laws,” had been proclaimed by the earlier scholar August Schleicher, against whom they set themselves.18 According to this principle, every aspect of language change could be explained systematically and rationally. This approach has generally been very successful, and, together with analogies from similar patterns, the “laws” have been able to explain approximately 70 percent to 80 percent of cases within language families. Such an approach, however, has significant limitations: the laws are not universal but language-specific.19 Furthermore, they apply only to phonetics not to semantics. Even accepting analogy, application of the laws always leaves a substantial “residue” of inexplicable shifts or resistances to change. This residue results from a number of factors that disturb the regularity of sound shifts. One of these is what has been called “phonesthemics.” Phonesthemes associate certain experiences or states with specific phonetic elements. These associations can be partially onomatopoeic as with the series slip, slide, slop and sleazy, or flash, splash, dash, crash, clash, mash and hash. Onomatopoeia, however, is not necessary. One finds such clusters as fly, flow and flutter, or, even more distantly, glitter, gleam, glow and gold, or the inconstant or iterative meanings of flutter, fritter, putter, glitter. All of these forms can best be described as “sound symbols,” phonetic associations with meanings.20 These, then tend to form clusters, although they may come from different sources or would “regularly” have diverged.21 In such cases, semantics, for which, there is much less regularity, impinges on phonetic “certainty.” Neo-Grammarians and their followers today seldom discuss this kind of mixture. If they are forced to do so, they refer to it pejoratively as “contamination.” Another source of the residue that cannot be explained in terms of



[CH. 1] THE IMAGE OF ANCIENT GREEK 35
sound laws is described by modern scholars as “lexical diffusion.” In this process some words undergo regular sound shifts, while others, for no clear phonetic reason, remain unaffected or go in different directions.22 As the historical linguists in the mid- and late nineteenth century focused almost exclusively on Indo-European, they paid no attention to its possible contacts with other languages except for those arising from what they called—using their geological model—“the substrate.”23 This substrate consisted of the real or imagined influences on Indo-European languages from the non–Indo-European languages of peoples conquered by Indo-European speakers. The Neo-Grammarians’ lack of interest in non-European languages is easy to explain. First, living in an intensely romantic age, they believed in the creative power of purity and the overriding importance of internal developments. Furthermore, as mentioned above, “they continued to treat language as a ‘thing’ independent of the speaker and his social context” and, further, believed that languages as “independent things” did not mix.24 The linguists, like all European intellectuals of the time, saw the speakers of Indo-European languages as the most active peoples in history. Therefore, they did not believe that their languages could have been substantially influenced by those of “less dynamic populations.” Third, study of language contact risked confusing the image of geologically slow developments because contact could lead to acceleration of change and, even worse, to irregularity. Walter Burkert, the leading modern authority on Greek religion, maintains when discussing loans into Greek, that “no rules of phonetic evolution can be established.”25 I would not go so far, believing that loans tend to be adapted with phonetic consistency; however, this is true only when they take place over the same period and between the same dialects.26 In the real world, languages change and regional dialects vary. Furthermore, loans come through various channels: the literary language, popular contact, religious ritual, trade, slavery or warfare. Loans made at different times or by different routes frequently do not follow the same patterns. Further uncertainty is added by a widespread phenomenon of “folk etymologies,” the turning of strange words into something more familar. Burkert continued about words introduced into Greek: “They imitate and go into hiding, adapting themselves to the roots and suffixes of native Greek.” He went on to cite the German for “hammock” (an Algongquin word) Hängematte “hanging mat” which looks native but is



36 BLACK ATHENA
not.27 An even more dramatic transformation is that of the German Eidgenossen “(band) bound by oath” into the French “Huguenot” alleged to be a diminutive of the common name Hugues.
SAUSSURE AND THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY EPIGONES OF NINETEENTH-CENTURY INDO-EUROPEAN STUDIES
Since the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, twentieth-century linguistics as a discipline has turned away from the study of the diachronic to the synchronic, from the way in which a language has developed to the way in which a language works as a system at any given time. The few scholars who have remained concerned with historical linguistics have remained in the shadow of their nineteenth-century forefathers. Only two major developments in Indo-European studies occurred in the twentieth century. The first was the discovery of texts in two (possibly three) extinct “Tocharian” languages in Xinjiang in western China. What is striking about these languages is that in some important respects they resemble western European languages, a fact that suggests that these eastern and western outliers have preserved archaic features lost at the center, and confirms the earlier scholarly move away from Sanskrit as the earliest and purest language.28 The second and more crucial discovery was the decipherment of cuneiform tablets in Hittite, the language of the powerful empire of the Second Millennium BCE which was based in central Anatolia, modern Turkey. The “new” language turned out to be similar to Indo-European though not conforming to the latter’s morphology. The discovery strongly affected the reconstruction of PIE phonology because the language was found to contain indications of two laryngeals /h/ and /hh/. The existence of these laryngeals justified a hypothesis previously put forward by Saussure, who held that, although such sounds, which existed in Semitic and other languages, had not been found in any Indo-European language, they should be reconstructed to explain anomalies of vocalization within Indo-European.29 Hittite, together with a number of other extinct languages found in what is now Turkey, has been accepted as the Anatolian subfamily, the earliest branching away from the Indo-European family. Edgar Sturtevant, the linguist who established Hittite as a sister, not a daughter, of Indo-European, invented the title “Indo-Hittite” to replace the older



[CH. 1] THE IMAGE OF ANCIENT GREEK 37
term for the larger language family. This title was accepted by a number of general linguists but not on the whole by those specializing in IndoEuropean.30 Their refusal to employ this useful term would seem to come not only from a reluctance to drop “European” from the title but also from an attachment to the nineteenth-century traditions of IndoEuropean studies. This devotion to a term epitomizes the modern IndoEuropeanists’ general retention of their predecessors’ tendencies to organicism, geological modeling and the romantic preference for isolation and purity.31 While all Indo-European languages have been viewed in this way, Greek, the language of the culture seen as the cradle and epitome of European civilization, has been seen as the extreme of purity. Conventional linguists still see Greek as fundamentally organic. Hence, they attribute its shifts to internal developments unaffected by outside influences. Those aspects of Greek that cannot be derived from Indo-European are attributed geologically to the “substrate.” They have markedly resisted the idea that Greek could have borrowed or copied from other contemporary languages.
RAMIFICATION OR INTERLACING
Walter Burkert wrote about the traditional Indo-Europeanist spirit as it affects Greek:
Greek linguistics has been the domain of Indo-Europeanists for nearly two centuries; yet its success threatens to distort reality. In all the standard lexicons, to give the etymology of a Greek word means per definitionem to give an Indo-European etymology. Even the remotest references—say, to Armenian or Lithuanian—are faithfully recorded; possible borrowings from the Semitic, however, are judged uninteresting and either discarded or mentioned only in passing, without adequate documentation. It is well known that a large part of the Greek vocabulary lacks any adequate Indo-European etymology; but it has become a fashion to prefer connections with a putative Aegean substratum or with Anatolian parallels, which involves dealing with largely unknown spheres, instead of pursuing connections to wellknown Semitic languages. Beloch even wanted to separate the Rhodian Zeus Atabyrios from Mount Atabyrion=Tabor, the mountain in Palestine, in favor of vague Anatolian resonances. Anti-Semitism was



38 BLACK ATHENA
manifest in this case; elsewhere it was often operating on an unseen level. Even first-rank Indo-Europeanists have made astonishing misjudgments.32
Burkert’s description brings us back, first, to the conventional model of a ramifying tree from a single trunk, rather than one with roots or the image of a complex lattice or mangrove, and, second, to a preference for self-generating developments within languages or language families.33 The tree model usefully explains divergence but not convergence. Most modern historical linguists are reluctant to consider areal shifts in ancient languages, especially in PIE and particularly in Greek. Most particularly object to shifts that go across language boundaries of the type found in historically observed changes. It would be much better for Indo-Europeanists, and specially those concerned with PIE and Greek, to consider sociolinguistics and, therefore, be open to the possibility or likelihood of interference from other contemporary languages. They might learn from more recent linguistic developments. For instance, the use of the auxiliary verb “to have” as the dominant or even the sole way to mark the perfect tense appears to have originated in France under the militarily powerful and culturally prestigious rule of Louis XIV. This usage is now found in France; peninsular Spain, but not Latin America; in northern, but not southern, Italy; and in western, but not eastern, Germany. A similar transformation in phonetics is the precisely plotted expansion of the uvular /r/, which started in Paris or Versailles but can now be found generally or sporadically in eight languages: French, Basque, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and German.34 Before investigating contacts between individual Indo-European and non–Indo-European languages, we should consider relations between Indo-European as a whole and other languages and language families. The next three chapters will be concerned with these relationships.



L inguists seem to have stopped, or at least suspended, the debate
over whether there was a single or multiple origin of all existing languages. A consensus that all existing languages are ultimately related to each other now appears to have emerged. Bitter debates remain, however, as to whether it is possible to demonstrate specific relationships or to reconstruct any aspect of the original ancestral language. In general terms, the division is between those crudely identified as “lumpers” and “splitters.” Lumpers look for the common features manifested in different phenomena, while splitters are more concerned with the distinctions among them. Splitters can be characterized as having a desire for certainty and a fear of error. Lumpers tend to believe that perfect accuracy and certainty are not attainable and that the most one can or should aim for is “competitive plausibility.” To put it in another way, lumpers tend to be frightened of two different kinds of error: First, errors of commission often involving the statement “x is related to y” which is later disproved. Second, errors of omission in which no relationship is proposed where, in fact, one exists. Splitters, by contrast, are overwhelmingly afraid of errors of commission. In recent years, the best known American linguistic lumpers have been the late Joseph Greenberg of Stanford and his student Merritt Ruhlen. Greenberg, who began as an anthropologist, will be remembered as the Linaeus or grand systematizer of the world’s languages. His classification

HYPER- AND SUPER-FAMILIES
CHAPTER 2



40 BLACK ATHENA
of African languages has become standard; his Euroasiatic scheme, similar to that of Soviet scholars, is now frequently accepted. His division of American languages into three families, including the vast “ProtoAmerican,” is still fiercely contested. Ruhlen, who accepts all of Greenberg’s macrofamilies, is now compiling what is already becoming the standard Guide to the World’s Languages and hopes to use this wide sweep to reconstruct Proto-Human or Proto-World.1 At the other end of the scale are the linguistic splitters; the most extreme of whom are the conventional Indo-Europeanists. These work, in the tradition referred to in the last chapter, on the elegant intricacies of the genetic relationships among Indo-European languages. Their attitude is epitomized in a remark by the Indo-Europeanist Eric Hamp, reported from a conference in 1996: “Our job is to produce an absolutely spotless reconstruction of Indo-European. Nothing else really matters.”2 Indo-Europeanists tend to be unhappy both with attempts to relate Indo-European to other language families and with the messy and, to them, aesthetically displeasing, process of linguistic borrowings from outside the Indo-European family.3 Though few Indo-Europeanists deny the possibility of wider linguistic relationships, they tend to dismiss any proposal of specific links as “mere speculation.” The requirement of certainty is often linked to a certain intellectual rigidity and a reverence for the scholarly ancestors that has made dialogue between them and other comparative and historical linguists increasingly difficult.
NOSTRATIC AND EUROASIATIC
Between the vague generalities of the reconstructors of Proto-World and the narrow-mindedness of the Indo-Europeanists, some scholars work at the intermediate level, considering large clusters of languages. The clusters of most concern to the subject of this book are Nostratic and Euroasiatic. The name Nostratic is distasteful because it is derived from the Latin nostras “our countryman,” which implies that speakers of languages from other language families are excluded from academic discussion. Nevertheless, no other generally accepted term exists for this very useful concept. The idea of genetic relationship between Semitic and Indo-European languages goes back to the origins of modern historical linguistics in the early nineteenth century and, beyond that, to the days of the church



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 41
fathers and the Middle Ages, when the language of both Eden and the Tower of Babel was assumed to have been Hebrew.4 In the nineteenth century, a number of attempts were made to demonstrate the relationship between Indo-European and Semitic verbal roots. Research along these lines, however, was inhibited, partly by the difficulties of achieving certainty but equally by the cult of the noble Indo-European-speaking Aryans. The passionate anti-Semitism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was equally impeding. The two significant exceptions to such trends were Hermann Möller and his student Holgar Pedersen.5 Möller was ignored and Pedersen’s ideas on this topic were considered an eccentricity in a major Indo-Europeanist and historian of Indo-European linguistics. Pedersen’s views, however, should not necessarily be seen as more enlightened than those of his colleagues, as the French linguist Albert L. M. Cuny pointed out: “Pedersen did not hide his faith in the single origin of the languages of the White Race.”6 In any event, as the contemporary historical linguist R. L. Trask puts it: “Pedersen did little work on his idea, and the Nostratic proposal languished halfforgotten in the literature for decades.”7
Soviet linguistics
After 1950 Nostratic studies revived in the Soviet Union. During the 1940s, Russian linguistics was dominated by Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr. Marr, who was born in Georgia in 1865, maintained that one linguistic super-family contained Indo-European, the Caucasian languages and Basque. He further held that linguistic stages demonstrated that languages reflected the social and economic organization of the society in which the language was spoken. English, for example, was a bourgeois language. This scheme was officially sanctioned in the Soviet Union from Marr’s death in 1934 until 1950. In that year, Joseph Stalin published a short article on linguistics which—for obvious reasons—was widely acclaimed.8 In it he denounced Marr’s rigid view of the ties between language and society. The article caused a relaxation of political pressures on linguists. Thus, after 1950, Stalin himself protected linguists from Stalinism. Stalin, who was fluent in both Georgian and Russian, did not attack Marr’s views on language families. In any event, both before and after 1950, the Soviet Union with its staggering diversity of languages required and supported linguists who were not restricted to Indo-European. The state also wanted to establish relationships beyond Indo-European



42 BLACK ATHENA
so one language family could encompass all the languages of the Soviet Union and could be used to unite them into one nation. For these reasons, it is not surprising that the modern founders of Nostratic studies, Vladislav Illich-Svitych and Aharon Dolgopolsky, emerged independently in Moscow around 1960 and that their ideas spread to the West in the 1970s with the diaspora of Soviet Jews. IllichSvitych was killed in a traffic accident in 1966, but Dolgopolsky continues his work in Haifa. Another Soviet Nostraticist, Vitaly Shevoroshkin has been installed at the University of Michigan since 1974. From there, over the last thirty years, he has been publicizing these general ideas with great passion.9 Such ideas, however, have not been exclusively Soviet or Russian. For decades, Carleton Hodge an American linguist specializing in Ancient Egyptian and the northern Nigerian language of Hausa (which belongs to the Chadic family of Afroasiatic) promoted what he called ‘“Lislakh” to denote a smaller language family than Nostratic. This language merely embraced Afroasiatic and Indo-European.10 The classicist and Semitist Saul Levin has also been working out detailed comparisons among the western classical languages of Hebrew, Sanskrit, Greek and Latin.11 The scholar most responsible for establishing Nostratic in the West, however, is Allan Bomhard, a computer specialist who works for Chiquita Banana.12 Different scholars have given Nostratic different boundaries. Originally, it was described as containing Indo-European and usually Afroasiatic and Uralic, the family to which Finnish and Hungarian belong. A number of linguists now extend the super-family to Altaic (which includes Turkish and Mongol) and Korean and even Japanese, Ainu and Inuit (Eskimo). Also sometimes seen as members of the family are Dravidian, still dominant in south India, and Kartvelian, the family of the Georgian languages of the Caucasus.13 In an article published in 1965, Illich-Svitych presented 607 possible common Nostratic roots. Dolgopolsky has claimed more than 1,900 but has so far not published them.14 Bomhard has brought out a list of 601.15 Although Dolgopolsky and Bomhard agree on many reconstructions, they are not always in agreement and their lists frequently do not coincide. The mathematical linguist Donald Ringe has challenged all Nostraticists saying that, while the commonality of vocabulary within Indo-European is significantly higher than one would expect, that seen in Nostratic corresponds almost exactly to chance.16 Ringe does not claim



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 43
that this “disproves” the Nostratic hypothesis; he merely says that the lexical similarities do not demonstrate it. He then goes on to insist that “objective proof ” is required in historical linguistics.17 He has been cited as having said words to the effect that: “What matters about all this is the method. The results are not that important.”18 Ringe’s model has been challenged on mathematical grounds.19 I have a further objection: his method treats the individual proposed correspondences as equal. As the specialist in east African languages Archie Tucker stated convincingly, “Comparison of pronouns has long played a leading in the postulation of genetic relationship.”20 Indeed one obtains a different picture by looking at the “hard core” of first and second person pronouns or pronominal elements, since these are generally stable and unlikely to be loaned. The pronouns include the following stems:
*mi-/*me, 1st singular *wa/*we, 1st plural *na-/*ne, 1st plural *t[h] ú-/*t[h] e-, 2nd singular.
Demonstrative stems beginning with s- and t[h] as well as relative and interrogative stems beginning with kw[h] exist widely in Nostratic.21 So too does a causative /s/.22 Although no morphological or structural features can be traced throughout Nostratic, in Euroasiatic—that is Nostratic without Afroasiatic—they can be detected in a concatenation or chain from Indo-European, or the larger family of Indo-Hittite, to Uralic. The chain continues from Uralic to Altaic from Altaic to Korean and Japanese, Yukagir, Chukchi and Inuit. Kartvelian (Georgian and related languages) and Dravidian are less easy to classify in this way.23 Common vocabulary is not the only link among Nostratic languages. In the last ten years, scholars led by Greenberg and Ruhlen have turned away from Nostratic toward Euroasiatic. Special relationships with the other members of the old Nostratic, such as Afroasiatic, Kartvelian and Dravidian, are not denied but they are not seen as belonging to the Euroasiatic core. In this book, I shall use the name Nostratic for the larger grouping and Euroasiastic for the smaller. In 1990 the Russian scholar Sergei Starostin read a paper in which he argued that PIE, Proto-Kartvelian, Proto-Uralic and Proto-Altaic were “daughters” of Proto-Nostratic and Proto-Dravidian was descended from Proto-Prenostratic. Proto-Semitic was still more distant.24 Starostin’s argument was based on principle of glottochronology set



44 BLACK ATHENA
out in the 1950s and 1960s by Maurice Swadesh, an Indian linguist, based in North America. Swadesh compiled a list of 100 (originally 200) words found in all societies, including those without agriculture. Swadesh argued that such basic words diverged from each other very slowly at a more or less regular rate. Therefore, he maintained, the fewer such words two related languages had in common, the longer their speakers had been apart. Swadesh also maintained, projecting back from historically observed separations like that of English and German, that one could establish an approximate date for those in prehistory. 25 In addition to the inherent imprecision of Swadesh’s method, even his champion Starostin concedes that his own calculations were in some ways arbitrary. Particular words receive different “weights.” Nevertheless, Starostin has faith in both aspects of the basic system, not merely the degree of separation but their absolute dates. He also admits that he only investigated Semitic, not Afroasiatic as a whole.26 Greenberg and Ruhlen agree with Starostin that Afroasiatic is a sister, not a daughter, language of Euroasiatic. Even Bomhard, who was initially attracted to parallels between Indo-European and Afroasiatic, hesitated for some years on the degree of relationship.27 Recently, however, he has rejoined the only published hold-out for a more intimate relationship between the two families—Aaron Dolgopolsky.28 When Afroasiatic is roughly compared to Greenberg’s list of common Euroasiatic morphological features (a list that is essentially IndoEuropean centered), Afroasiatic scores significantly lower than Uralic and Altaic but at very much the same level as the other families.29 On the other hand, Afroasiatic and Indo-European share a feature lacking in other Euroasiatic families— sex-linked gender. The other language families generally distinguish only between animate and inanimate entities. I shall argue in Chapter 4 that Indo-European gender was at least partially copied from Afroasiatic. Starostin’s omission of six of the seven Afroasiatic language families significantly skews the numbers of Euroasiatic cognates he finds. For instance, the first person singular form *mi found throughout Euroasiatic is not found in Semitic but it is in Chadic and Highland East Cushitic.30 In general, the personal and other pronouns given above are almost all restricted to two Nostratic families, Indo-European and Afroasiatic. Long ago in 1974, the Semitist Robert Hoberman wrote a paper in which he showed convincingly that, following the Hopper-Gamkrelidze reconstruction of PIE (See below Chapter 4), the triconsonantal roots



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 45
of Indo-European and Semitic were remarkably similar. Furthermore, they were bound by the same constraints regarding which consonants could occur with each other.31 In morphology, the Egyptologist John Ray demonstrated extraordinarily close parallels in both form and function among the Egyptian “stative,” the Akkadian “permansive” and the Hittite -hi° conjugation. These together with similar Indo-European and Afroasiatic prepositions (discussed below) and the parallel uses of ablaut or vowel change led him to conclude, “while we should continue to enter a plea for caution, it is becoming more and more likely that the Semitic, Hamitic and IndoEuropean languages were originally one.”32 Ray wrote this without taking into account the discovery in the 1970s of the ancient Semitic language Eblaite. This language was not only spoken, but also one of the written languages used by the bureaucracy of the wealthy and powerful city of Ebla in the middle of the Third Millennium BCE. 33 When studied with the equally ancient Semitic language Akkadian and the “sister language” Ancient Egyptian, some of the Eblaite prepositions show remarkable similarities to reconstructed PIE:
Eblaite Akkadian Egyptian Canaanite PIE English in, ina ina m lE en in ìna ana n/r >el an(u) to, on ade adi r Œad ad up to, to. m bE bi/be by, at.34 itti hnc Œet eti yet, with.
The last two examples have not yet been found in Eblaite, but even so they indicate links between Afroasiatic and Indo-European. Swadesh’s list does not include any prepositions or conjunctions, even though these forms would seem to be as stable and good indicators of relationships as his basic nouns and verbs. Given this situation, it is interesting to note the remarks of the Semitist I. J. Gelb about these apparent cognates:
One important feature of Iblaic [sic] which should not be left out of the discussion concerns the occurrence of certain prepositions . . . which Iblaic shares partly with Akkadian but with no other Semitic language. This very old feature of Iblaic furnishes an important piece of evidence linking early Semitic languages with Indo-European.35



46 BLACK ATHENA
Furthermore, the internal pattern within Semitic of the first two examples, in and ìna, indicates that there was a shift from n>l. Egyptian and Canaanite have similar n>l correspondences. In this case, a number of words only attested with /l/ in Semitic become parallel to PIE /n/. For instance, the Akkadian and Arabic la| Canaanite lo > <*na@> (the
Egyptian n or nn ) “no” strikingly resembles the PIE *ne|. The Akkadian
lilatu, Ge’ez lelit Canaanite, lyl “night” but lyn “to spend the night” from a reconstructed reduplication *netnet resembles the PIE nekw-t “night.”36 Such words would seem fundamental and unlikely to be borrowed. On the other hand, as shown in Chapter 1, almost any aspect of language can be transferred. In the case of Afroasiatic (probably its most northern member Semitic) and Indo-European it is clear that many words and probably even the sex-linked gender system (see Chapter 4) were borrowed. One should not overemphasize the genetic relations to the exclusion of later contacts. At this point, it is worth pushing speculation still further to glance at the possible origins of Nostratic itself. John Kerns believed that it was a branch of the Dene-Caucasian or Nadene, now surviving in the Caucasus, China, Tibet and Burma and in northwest America.37 This idea seems plausible, although, as we shall see below, there appear to be significant Khoisan influences on Afroasiatic.
A place of origin for Nostratic
It would now seem helpful to consider three of the ways in which historical linguists attempt to pinpoint regions of origin. The first criterion by which one can locate the original home or Urheimat—to use the German term preferred by linguists—of a language family is simply that of the geographical convenience.38 Find a place in or near the region in which it is known that the languages are spoken, or were spoken historically, and from which they could easily have diffused. This approach is called the principle of least moves. It would be implausible, for instance, to propose that Indo-European arose in Africa. None of its member languages are attested as having been spoken on that continent and it would be difficult to postulate ways in which Indo-European could have spread over its later known range from such a center. Nevertheless, sometimes languages or language families appear to have originated on, or beyond, the fringe of their later ranges. For instance, the Navahos of Arizona and New Mexico make up



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 47
the great majority of Nadene speakers in North America. No linguists, however, suppose that the language family originated there. The consensus is that the language family came from Asia. Nevertheless, in general, geographical plausibility remains a basic way to approach this problem. A second way of discovering an Urheimat is to establish the original geographical range of the speakers of a language family, through vocabulary. The use of words common throughout a language to indicate the level of material culture of the peoples speaking the proto-language has been mentioned earlier. Similarly, other terms can be used to estimate the landscape and climatic zone of the Urheimat. One must, however, be particularly careful about this. The semantics of a word for natural phenomena can change drastically. Clearly related words from the reconstructed PIE form *mori can be found in most European languages but they have a range of meanings from “swamp” to “lake” to “sea.” Thus, the words provide no information as to whether or not the speakers of PIE lived by a sea. On the other hand, the root *bergo occurs in most Indo-European language families meaning “birch”—although the Latin derivation signifies “ash.” Birches do not grow around the Mediterranean. Similar cases can be made for the common words for willow, as well as for snow and for such animals as the bear, beaver and wolf. These commonalties suggest that PIE developed in a territory with a northern climate. Although this technique should be used with great caution, it can provide some indication of a language family’s original home. The third method of locating the place from which a language family dispersed is to look at the degree of variation among dialects or languages in a given area. Behind this method is Swadesh’s idea that all languages diverge at approximately similar rates over time—fundamentally, the principle of glottochronology. While glottochronology is concerned with time, the principle of diversity is concerned with space. That is to say, the greater the variations of a particular language or language family in a particular region, the longer it is likely to have been spoken there. The most commonly used example of this principle is that of the distribution of English dialects. In Britain, where English has been spoken for more than a thousand years, there are many distinct dialects, some of them like Geordie, which is spoken in parts of Durham and Northumberland, restricted to quite small areas. Along the east coast of



48 BLACK ATHENA
America, where English speakers have lived for three to four hundred years, distinctive dialects can be found in New England and “the South.” By contrast, in the vast territory of the Midwest and West where English has been used for less than two hundred years, there is a remarkable uniformity. Time is generally more important than space in the diversification of languages.39 One problem with this principle is that many languages are not left alone to diversify in peace and are affected by neighboring languages. Thus, they can produce different dialects and languages at much faster rates. For instance, the speech of New York City is distinctive because it has been heavily influenced by the high proportion of New Yorkers for whom English is a second language. The principle of local diversity can also be misleading if the original region in which the language was formed, or its Urheimat, is overrun by a single dialect or another language. For instance, historical records and place names show that the Celtic branch of Indo-European developed in areas of continental Europe where German is now spoken. Today it only survives in western Britain and Brittany. Another problem is that states can establish common standards of speech over wide areas that tend to obscure earlier variation: French in France, Italian in Italy etc. Today, looking at diversity among Romance languages one would choose Switzerland as the Urheimat since French, Italian and Romansch are all spoken there. When in reality we know from historical records that Lazio or the Latin Plain around Rome is the original home. Nevertheless, in the absence of such historical records the principle of diversity is one of the few pointers available to indicate where language families began.40 These three methods are full of uncertainties and the earlier the “disintegration” of a language occurs the more difficult it is to discover where it took place. Even so, in conjunction with each other and with linguistic relationships and archaeological remains, these methods often make it possible to establish plausible hypotheses for a language family’s Urheimat.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE ORIGIN OF NOSTRATIC AND EUROASIATIC
I shall argue in the following chapters that the Afroasiatic and IndoHittite language families originated with the spread of agriculture within the last 12,000 years. Therefore, the origins of Nostratic must go back still further at least into the Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age. An outer



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 49
limit is provided by the strong likelihood that modern people (Homo sapiens sapiens ) only moved out of Africa approximately 100, 000 years ago, and the fact that other language super-families exist makes it impossible that Nostratic spread at that time.41 Thus we are looking for a period between 100,000 and 12,000 years BP (before the present).
Nostratic and the “Epipaleolithic” cultures of the Nile
The linguist Carleton Hodge proposed that Lislakh, his name for Nostratic, began in the Middle Nile between 20,000 and 14,000 years BP.42 Archaeologists agree that group of Late Old Stone Age cultures did indeed flourish along the Nile in Nubia and Upper Egypt between 18,000 and 14,000 years BP. The general name given to this type of culture is sometimes confusing. Some observers use Middle Stone Age or Mesolithic. Since Mesolithic cultures, however, tended to be coastal and the Middle Nile is far from the sea, these cultures are generally called Epipaleolithic. These people lived by gathering seeds and fruit, hunting small animals, catching birds and fishing, but increasingly they also harvested and ate grains. The large numbers of querns, or grinding stones, found in the area make this fact evident. Furthermore, recovered teeth of these people were found to be worn down, apparently from eating grain containing grit from the grinding stones.43 Querns, however, were also used for tubers, charred remains of which have been found from this period, 18–17,000 years ago.44 What is striking about these cultures, apart from their dense population, was their use of microliths.45 Microliths are tiny flints or other sharp stones blunted on one edge so they can be set in wooden shafts as arrow heads. They make it possible to hunt small game with bows and arrows and were also set in series on sickles, imitating animal jawbones. Their use on sickles allowed for harvesting of grasses, for the first time, and the development of agriculture.46 Finely made microliths had been developing in various parts of central and southern Africa as early as 70,000 years ago.47 They appear to have spread north to the Nile Valley cultures by 17,000 BP. Sheen indicates that many microliths were in fact used for cutting grasses, possibly including barley.48 As I hope to show below, Afroasiatic probably began somewhere between the confluence of the White and Blue Niles and southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya around 11,000 BP and Indo-Hittite in central



50 BLACK ATHENA
Anatolia around 10,000. Thus, in looking for the original speakers of Proto-Nostratic, we need a population living between or near these two zones sometime between 30,000 and 12,000 BP. Languages usually expand when their speakers have a greater power or possess some social or economic advantages over their neighbors. Latin spread with the Roman Empire, Arabic with the expansion of Islam and English with the British and American empires of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Thus, in searching for the material culture of the speakers of Proto-Nostratic, one should focus on what appear to have been the most successful societies and estimate their level of development. As mentioned above, one method of estimating the time at which a language family broke up is to look at the technology for which there is a common vocabulary in the daughter languages. Thus, for instance, Indo-Europeanists plausibly argue that PIE speakers possessed agriculture and polished stone tools but did not cast metal, because no words for “bronze” or “cast metal” are common to members of the family. By general agreement, the initial spread of Nostratic cannot be attributed to agriculture. Dolgopolsky states that the speakers of ProtoNostratic were not agricultural and that their language “has no words for sowing or ploughing, but has words for harvesting.”49 Furthermore, he believes that the proto-language had no word for pottery.50 Allan Bomhard holds that Proto-Nostratic had roots involving the preparation of vegetable foods: *÷bar/bEr, “grain, cereal, barley,” *÷gar/gEr, “crush, grate, grind” and *÷mul/mol, “rub, crush, mill.” He, too, can find none for planting or sowing.51 A proto-agricultural society in the Nile Valley during the later stages of the last Ice Age would fit well with what one would predict from verbal roots common to Nostratic. The advantage that people of the Middle Nile possessed was, as Hodge suggested, microliths.52 As mentioned above, there is no doubt that southern Africa was the earliest region to develop these. They appear not to have reached Europe until around 9000 BP.53 In China, however, microliths could possibly go back to 24,000 BP and they were certainly widespread by 22,000.54 Although much later than the early southern African microliths, the Chinese artifacts are earlier than those of the Nile cultures. More than likely the Chinese invention was independent. It is interesting to speculate that the lack of the “Nostratic advantage” is the reason why Chinese remains in the earlier Nadene family.55 The major objection to the hypothesis that Proto-Nostratic came from



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 51
such a proto-agricultural culture is that, although the stone tools used at this time in the Nile Valley generally followed the microlithic tradition, the proportion of microliths used and the types of tools made, varied considerably from place to place and time to time.56 Archaeologists may have exaggerated these distinctions. We know that modern people use rocks that are locally available and that the quality of different stones affects the types of tools made. Furthermore, when people camp in specific places to exploit particular resources they use very different tools.57 The variation of lithic culture does weaken the hypothesis that the Nile proto-agriculturalists had a single, or even a single dominant, language. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the advantages of the argument outweigh the disadvantages. Dolgopolsky argues on the principle of Wörter und Sache “words and things” that the existence in his reconstructed ProtoNostratic of roots for “snow” and “frost,” as well as for “leopard” and “hyena,” indicate a warm Mediterranean Urheimat.58 Dolgopolsky believes that it was in southwest Asia. The four thousand years between 18,000 and 14,000 BP or 17,000-13,000 BCE were still in the last Ice Age and the climate of Lower Nubia and Upper Egypt then was apparently considerably cooler and more humid than it is today. That climate resembled that found after the end of the Ice Age in the foothills around the Fertile Crescent in southwest Asia. In the earlier case, however, the annual flood of the Nile helped the natural abundance. Kerns, who located the origin of Euroasiatic in the Fertile Crescent just south of the Caucasus, agreed with Carleton Hodge on the type of culture that promoted Nostratic:
The more I study the matter, the more I am convinced that the spread of the Nostratic speaking peoples was occasioned by the spread of Mesolithic culture, for it occupied the right positions in time and space and its characteristic features are compatible with the residual vocabulary of the Nostratic families—it was the last of the pre-agricultural eras in Eurasia.59
Working from linguistic evidence, Kerns suggested around 15000 BCE for Proto-Nostratic.60 Starostin, using glottochronology, arrived at circa 11000 BCE (13000 BP) for the break up of Pre-Proto-Prenostratic including Dravidian and that of Proto-Nostratic at circa 9,000 BCE (11000 BP).61 Thus the evidence from archaeology and linguistics is roughly in synchrony.



52 BLACK ATHENA
The breakup of the Middle Nile culture
Both the size and the number of settlements found strongly suggest that the population boom at this time suddenly decreased, possibly owing to a series of extremely high Nile floods. Similar population density along these stretches of the Nubian and Egyptian Nile Valley was not reached again for another 6,000 years, until just before the beginning of dynastic rule in the Fourth Millennium BCE.62 Meanwhile in Palestine, a similar culture, the Kebaran, may be dated as early as the Thirteenth Millennium. This culture, like the earlier and contemporary Nilotic cultures, appears to have been proto-agricultural with microliths and morters. Given the earlier development of microliths and morters and the consumption of grains further south, the Nile cultures probably give rise to the Kebaran. The African linguist and prehistorian Christopher Ehret sees the Kebaran as having interacted “by the 12th millennium BCE at the latest” with the Mushabian culture of Lower Egypt, which collected wild grass and grain. From this mixture, the protoagricultural Natufian culture emerged between 11,000 and 10,000 BCE.63 In the following millennia Natufian culture played an important role in the creation of southwest Asian agriculture.64 The significance of Africans in these cultures and early development of agriculture in southwest Asia and Anatolia can be seen from “African” skeletal traits and painted images both among (Mediterranean) Natufians, and early farmers (at Çatal Hüyük and Nea Nikomedia).65 I think it is helpful to see the Mushabian and Kebaran microlithic and proto-agricultural material cultures as those of the speakers of ProtoEuroasiatic. In the improving climate and the opening up of the glaciers of Asia and Europe, Euroasiatic spread into Eurasia replacing Nadene and other language families spoken by Paleolithic hunters and gatherers, especially the big game hunters, whose game was becoming extinct.
The origins of agriculture
Until about forty years ago, prehistorians simply saw the adoption of agriculture as an advance of knowledge and technique worthy of the title “revolution.” More recently, however, this idea has been qualified by the discovery that many peoples who gather wild fruits tubers and grains today have a good knowledge of plant propagation but are still reluctant to grow food. They argue, quite reasonably, that since they can



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 53
reap enough wild plants why should they go to the trouble of sowing them? In some ways, then, the adoption of cultivation should be seen not as progress but as the result of failure—the failure of wild plants to sustain the population. On the other hand, once women and men begin to select grains for planting genetic planning could certainly have raised yields sharply. This increase coupled with a greater regularity of harvests can allow for bigger grain supplies that could support much higher population densities.
GORDON CHILDE AND COLIN RENFREW
At this point we should consider two of the dominant figures in twentiethcentury British archaeology and “deep” linguistics, Gordon Childe and Colin Renfrew.
Gordon Childe
Born in Sydney in 1892, Gordon Childe was both ugly and charismatic. As an upper-class Australian, he studied at Oxford where he became interested in the origins of Europe and particularly in the nature and diffusion of the Indo-European language family. In the early stages of his career his political views were the very Australian combination of social radicalism and racism. His first major book was entitled The Aryans. Later he became a Marxist and realized that the two belief systems were incompatible. He became a consistent opponent to Nazism and racism in both politics and archaeology. As a Marxist, Childe shifted his interest from language to prehistoric material cultures, but he never lost sight of the information to be gained from other sources of information. Equally, he took a middle position on the question of diffusion. He rejected the view of prehistory as a series of migrations and conquests by “master races” who imposed their civilizations on lesser peoples or simply exterminated them. On the other hand, he was fascinated by what he saw as the spread of specific cultural traits. Thus, he proclaimed what he called “modified diffusion” in which, at certain times for various reasons, cultures adopted and adapted features from elsewhere. Childe was concerned in particular with what he saw as “the irradiation of European barbarism by Oriental civilization.”66 Even during the later stages of his life, however, he viewed “the irradiation” only as a “prelude” to the “real” European civilization of the Indo-European



54 BLACK ATHENA
speakers. Still, affected by his earlier notions of excellence and survival of the fittest, Gordon Childe committed suicide in 1957 by throwing himself off a beloved mountain in New South Wales. In a letter, only opened twenty years after his death, he explained that he did not want to be an old man inhibiting younger scholars and hampering the development of the field.67
Colin Renfrew
In a surprising number of ways, Colin Renfrew sees himself as Childe’s successor. Although he may not seem so at first glance, Colin Renfrew is a spectacular figure. For a time in the 1950s, his fate, and possibly those of ancient history and Britain, hung in the balance as the Cambridge student hesitated between conservative politics and archaeology. He chose the latter and, with enormous energy and intelligence, he promoted the “new archaeology”—a school that believes in introducing “scientific rigor” into what they see as a flabby field. Its members promote the use of such techniques as radiocarbon dating and neutron activation. They also support those who argue that techniques devised to study Old Stone Age cultures should be applied to research on later periods. These techniques would include the mathematical study of the distribution of material objects, such as flints and pot sherds. Applied to later periods, these methods might cover a given area and the calculation of econological niches, such as the amount of land and resources needed to support a given population. For such schemes, islands might form the ideal units and there is no doubt that for Renfrew the most exciting and rewarding sites have been the Cyclades Archipelago southeast of the Greek mainland and the Orkney Islands to the north of Scotland. Very much a child of the 1940s and 1950s, Renfrew loves “Modern Art” and simple purity of form and line. These ideals are elegantly represented by the beautiful smooth marble Cycladic figures from the Early Bronze Age and by the scalloped treeless land and seascapes of bleak and wonderful Orkney. Although consciously reacting against the lush romanticism of the nineteenth century, the romantic search for purity and authenticity survived in this new form for most of the twentieth. Renfrew may have abandoned politics but his past has stood him in good stead. For members of the establishment, he stands out in an academic world where brilliance and left-wing views tend to be distressingly



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 55
aligned. Hence, he is now a lord, the former Master of Jesus College, Disney Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge and director of the wellendowed McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research. These positions, combined with his energy and intelligence, make him a major power in international archaeology. In many of his ideas and even in the specifics of his career Renfrew has followed the lead of Childe: Childe was concerned with the origins of agriculture; Renfrew is concerned with the origins of agriculture. Childe wrote books on the roots of European civilization; Renfrew wrote a book on the roots of European civilization. Childe excavated in Orkney; Renfrew excavated in Orkney. In two major respects, however, they have differed profoundly. First, in politics, where Childe was a Marxist, Renfrew is a conservative. In another way, however, Renfrew has been much more radical than Childe. Where Childe was a modified diffusionist, Renfrew began his career as a strict isolationist. One of Renfrew’s initial major preoccupations was the denial of Near Eastern origins for Europe. Childe wrote extensively about the “Oriental Prelude to European Prehistory” while Renfrew’s major work, although dedicated to Childe, has the remarkable and provocative title of The Emergence of Civilization: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC. In this work he claimed that despite the undoubted similarities between technical developments in the Near East and the Aegean, there was no reason to suppose that the development of the two cultures was connected. Furthermore, he argued, since the beginning of the Neolithic, Europe had been distinct from Asia and Africa and European cultural developments had been essentially local.68 Renfrew also found the conventional view of the diffusion of IndoEuropean intolerable as it required substantial outside influences in Europe, thousands of years after the first practice of agriculture there. In 1987 he published a book entitled Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins. In this he argued against conventional wisdom, that Indo-European had started as the language of early agriculture in central Anatolia and had spread from there westwards to Europe and possibly eastwards to Iran and India. Even sympathetic reviewers objected that Renfrew had not made the crucial distinction between the broader language family of Indo-Hittite and Indo-European in the narrow sense. They also objected that the early agriculture of Iran and India was associated with peoples who were clearly not Indo-Hittite speaking. 69



56 BLACK ATHENA
Renfrew responded imaginatively to such criticisms. In an article published in 1989, he argued that the origins and spread of both IndoEuropean and Dravidian should be linked to the development of agriculture. That is to say, the inhabitants of the hilly areas around Mesopotamia and further west spread their culture and language as they migrated. In so doing they brought agriculture into areas that had previously only been sparsely inhabited by hunters and gatherers. In the 1990s, Renfrew went still further, making a u-turn from his earlier isolationism. He has become a “long-ranger” and is now interested in macro-language families and vast temporal and geographical sweeps in prehistory. Using his powerful academic position, he has singlehandedly made Euroasiatic and Nostratic and other possible distant linguistic relationships, legitimate topics of scholarly debate in the West. He invited Dolgopolsky to publish his Nostratic hypothesis and then asked others sympathetic and hostile to it to comment. He has continued to bring out books on American languages and “Time Depth in Historical Linguistics.”70
LANGUAGE AND GENETICS
Before ending this chapter it would seem useful to consider something that I believe to be a red herring, at least on the questions with which we are concerned. During the past few years, a number of scholars have tried to link language to genetics. They have shown, for instance, significant correlations between very slight genetic differences and national and linguistic divisions in Europe.71 While these correlations may hold for individual languages, they do not hold true for language families. For example, Slavic speakers are closer genetically to Hungarians and Turks, who speak non–Indo-European languages, than they are to speakers of the Indo-European German and Italian. General attempts to correlate language families with genetic populations are even less impressive. Even the Italian geneticist Luigi Cavalli-Svorza, who proposes such correlations, concedes that the Sino-Tibetan language family, which includes Chinese, Tibetan and Burmese, is spoken by two genetically distinct populations, the north Eurasian and southeast Asian.72 Even more striking is the case where peoples of starkly different Melanesian and Polynesian physical appearances speak languages of the quite closely related Oceanic subfamily of the Malayo-Polynesian family.73 The case



[CH. 2] “NOSTRATIC” AND “EUROASIATIC” FAMILIES 57
of Afroasiatic, which bridges the most profound genetic divisions, will be considered later. What should be made clear at this point is that in looking at the spread of Nostratic, we are considering cultural and linguistic shifts with no necessary connection to genetic or “racial” ones. By the period 16,00010,000 BCE, we are looking at relatively rapid cultural and linguistic diffusion in which whole populations may or may not have migrated. Thus, it would seem likely that the hypothetical northwards spread of Nile Valley proto-agricultural culture was primarily a cultural and linguistic one, even though peoples with African characteristics appear among the early agriculturalists of southwest Asia.74 In the long run, neither the Caucasoid populations of southwest Asia nor the people or East Africa types found to the south of Egypt changed basically.
CONCLUSION
Dealing with such widespread and varied hypothetical language families as Nostratic and Euroasiatic is bound to cause considerable confusion and uncertainty. Nevertheless, the linguistic and archaeological evidence do converge to provide an approximate period, 15,000-12,000 BP, and an approximate location, the Middle Nile, for the origin of Nostratic and the Mesolithic in western Eurasia. The same tools suggest that ProtoEuroasiatic should be associated with the Mushabian, Kebaran and Natufian material cultures in the Levant. Thus the conventional longrange wisdom that Afroasiatic formed further south and is the oldest branch or sister of Euroasiatic is convincing. A number of significant features, however, suggest a special relationship between Afroasiatic and Indo-European. Some of these, such as the pronouns and the prepositions mentioned above, can be explained by the two families being particularly archaic and less influenced by Nadene and other Asian language families. Others can be explained by contacts between Afroasiatic and PIE speakers.75 We shall see later that a number of lexical loans occurred between these two.76 Thus, it would seem likely that morphological and other important features of PIE, notably binary sexual gender, were influenced by Afroasiatic. I shall discuss these issues in the next two chapters.



THE ORIGINS OF AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA
B
efore considering the rise and spread of Afroasiatic, I should like to look at linguistic and agricultural developments in Africa as a whole. As mentioned in the last chapter, Joseph Greenberg usually used the method of mass lexical comparison. He compared word lists for basic things, qualities and processes, generally corresponding to the Swadash list, from hundreds of languages and dialects. This technique has roused suspicion and hostility from more conventional linguists who have traditionally preferred to compare languages two by two or better still, to examine morphological parallels. As I argued in Chapter 1, while morphological parallels are preferable to lexical ones if one can find them, they are seldom visible among distantly related languages.1 Using his method of mass lexical comparison, Greenberg established a scheme according to which all African language families could be classified as belonging to one of four families: Khoisan, Nilo-Saharan, NigerCongo and Afroasiatic. The Khoisan family is now concentrated in the deserts and scrub land of southwestern Africa but there are possible outliers among huntergatherers in east Africa, as far north as Tanzania. Although only spoken
AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC
CHAPTER 3



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 59
by very few people, these languages are extremely diverse and are widely supposed to be linked only by possessing the famous clicks. They have virtually no common lexicon or items of vocabulary.2 This variety suggests that the family is extremely old in the areas where it is still spoken. Its distribution and the present occupations of Khoisan speakers strongly suggest that they had nothing to do with the development of African agriculture. It is also very likely that Khoisan was formerly spoken over much of eastern and southern Africa and was replaced by the languages of the herders and agriculturalists who spoke other languages. The best known speakers of Nilo-Saharan languages are the Nuer and Shilluk peoples of the southern Sudan and the Luo and Masai of Kenya and Tanzania. Many speakers of these languages are associated with a particular physical type. They tend to be tall, thin and very black. These languages are similar to the Nubian now spoken on the Nile in northern Sudan and southern-most Egypt. Many other less-close NiloSaharan languages, however, are spoken in relatively small, but widespread, pockets from the upper reaches of the Niger to the eastern Sahara. As mentioned above, the family could even have links to Dravidian in India. Their widespread and great diversity suggests that this family too is extremely ancient. Although most Nilo-Saharan speakers are now herders or cultivators, hunters and gatherers almost certainly were the first speakers. The range of Nilo-Saharan seems originally to have been in the Sahara and in the Sahel to its south. The complexities of the relations among the different Nilo-Saharan families are epitomized in the very different family trees set up by two of the leading scholars of this and other African language families: Lionel Bender and Christopher Ehret.3 Niger-Congo includes the vast majority of the languages of western Africa as well as the huge Bantu subfamily that covers nearly all of central and southern Africa.4 Its success seems to have been linked to the spread of agriculture in the Sahel. Recently, some African linguists have begun to “outlump” Greenberg and they now see Niger-Congo as merely an extremely successful branch of Nilo-Saharan or, as they now call the macrofamily, Kongo-Saharan or Niger-Saharan.5 The linguist and agricultural specialist Roger Blench, a proponent of Niger-Saharan, has also pointed out an interesting discrepancy between the great genetic and phenotypic diversity in Africa and the relative simplicity of Greenberg’s language classification. Blench, therefore, has not been surprised to find traces of “remnant” or pre-Niger-Saharan languages in west, central, and east Africa.6



60 BLACK ATHENA
With its great reach over time and the impossibility of agriculture contributing to the success of Niger-Saharan, an Urheimat for this family more precise than northern and north central Africa is impossible to propose. The spread of the “sub-branch” Niger-Congo, on the other hand, may be related to such African agricultural developments as the domestication of millets and sorgum, as well as to expansion into a wellwatered Sahara after the end of the Ice Age. Using the principle of linguistic diversity, the origins of Niger-Congo have conventionally been placed at the western end of the Sahel, somewhere in the region of the Niger’s headwaters. Proponents of this view have assumed that the Kordofanian speakers of the Nuba or Kordofan Mountains of west central Sudan had migrated from the west.7 Roger Blench disagrees and bases his argument on linguistics. First, he sees the closest relatives to Niger-Congo within Nilo-Saharan, as Central Sudanic now spoken in Chad and western Sudan. Second, following Greenberg, he sees the great differences between Kordofanian and the rest of the Niger-Congo as indicating the earliest split in the family. Thus, he proposes western Sudan as the Urheimat of Niger-Congo. In this case the region of origin seems relatively close to that of Afroasiatic and possibly that of Nilo-Saharan.8
THE ORIGINS AND SPREAD OF AFROASIATIC
Paleoclimate and archaeology
Before looking at the linguistic arguments on the origins and spread of Afroasiatic, I will consider the paleoclimatic and archaeological background. As discussed above, correlations between language and material culture are dangerous. Nevertheless, they are necessary, given the lack of historical or precise linguistic information. When viewing rapid linguistic “explosions” historians have rightly looked for exceptional causes. For instance, the expansion of Bantu can be plausibly linked to the introduction of forest rim agriculture and the use of iron, which opened up a whole new ecological niche.9 A similar opportunity opened from natural causes in north Africa in the Twelfth Millennium BP, at about the time, postulated on linguistic grounds for the “explosion” of Afroasiatic.



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 61
The end of the Ice Age and the agricultural revolution
The present conventional wisdom on the origins of agriculture is the following: The last Ice Age ended about 12,000 years ago. Its end had two major effects on the world’s climate: First was a global warming of the kind that is causing concern today. Second was a general, though not universal, increase of rainfall, as the shrinking polar ice caps and other ice sheets released melting water. In this new climate, it is striking to find that between 12,000 and 6000 BP plant cultivation began in several different regions; southwest and southeast Asia, China, Papua, South and Central America and in a belt across northern Africa. Animals were also domesticated in several of these regions. We do not know enough about the ends of earlier ice ages and it may be that, this time the rapid warming took place in the best possible way to encourage the development of agriculture. What is certain, however, is that for the first time Homo sapiens sapiens was present in many continents at such a period, apparently the critical factor in the development of agriculture. The existence of a very early proto-agriculture in the Nile Valley (discussed in the last chapter) would help explain why southwest Asia and northern Africa appear to have been the earliest regions to go through the agricultural revolution. In southwest Asia and Lower Egypt, agriculture became based on wheat and barley, wild forms of which still grow in the hills of southwest Asia. For this reason, this region was assumed to be where these crops were first cultivated. From there they were thought to spread into the Nile Valley. Barley, however, could have been cultivated in Ethiopia even earlier. Although wild barleys are not found in Ethiopia, the country contains a far greater variety of domesticated barley than southwest Asia. Following the general principle that a crop would have been first established in a region that now has the greatest diversity of that plant, some paleobotanists have suggested that barley was cultivated in Ethiopia before it was in southwest Asia.10 The wild Asian barleys could be explained as “escapes” from domestic varieties. It would seem more likely, however, that both the southwest Asian and Ethiopian barleys derived from the barley harvested and possibly sown earlier in the Middle Nile (see the previous chapter). Sorghums, millets and other crops were also cultivated in warmer regions of Ethiopia, possibly as early as the Seventh Millennium BCE, though most were domesticated in other parts of Africa.11



62 BLACK ATHENA
In this warm and wet period what had been—and is now—rain forest expanded into what is now the tree savanna region, and what is now the Sahel became tree savanna. The Sahara shrank to less than half its present size and was divided in two by what has been called the “Saharan fertile crescent,” an area that linked the Sudanese Nile to the Maghreb.12 “Mediterranean” forest grew in the highlands of Tibestsi and Hoggar and from them flowed a network of rivers linking to the Niger and Lake Chad, which was twice its present size. All the east African lakes appear to have been connected to the Nile.13 The expansion of thick forest cover made hunting more difficult. Thus the savanna hunter-gatherers (and planters?) were both pushed and drawn into the Sahara. The new ecological niche, however, was far greater than the one they had lost, large numbers of newcomers appear to have driven the original Nilo-Saharan speakers into remote regions, where some still survive many millennia later.14 Evidence from physical anthropology indicates that during the early “boom” period from the Tenth to the Sixth Millennium BP the population was largely “negroid.” On the other hand, while this appears to be confirmed in early preherding rock paintings, later paintings from the so-called Bovidian period indicate a more mixed population, though still predominantly “negroid.”15
Khartoum Mesolithic or “Early Khartoum”
A common material culture is known as Khartoum Mesolithic or “Early Khartoum” from its type site, excavated in the 1940s.16 Evidence of this culture, dating from the Tenth to the Seventh Millennium BP, has been found in more than forty sites over a huge range stretching from Central Kenya to Eastern Sudan and as far west as Algeria and Senegal.17 As Map 1 shows, its ecological zone is quite clear: with one exception, all the sites are north and east of the present Sudanian region of woodland and grass savanna. This area seems to have been tropical rain forest at the time. Most sites are in the present Sahara in regions that were then probably Sahelian grass steppe and light woodland. All were close to what were then lakes or rivers. The characteristic objects of this material culture were bone harpoon heads, most of them barbed on only one side, or uniserial, and pottery decorated with wavy, or, later, dotted wavy, lines. These local inventions are attested before 9000 BP, earlier than the use of pottery in southwest Asia.18 In the Sahara the pottery was probably made in imitation of



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 63
natural containers of liquids, ostrich eggs and calabash gourds. It appears to have developed from clay basket linings made to prevent seeds from falling through the mesh. Containers like this are still used in parts of Sudan and Ethiopia.19 Many authors have seen these objects as clear-cut indication of the spread of a single culture.20 The distinguished prehistorian of Africa David Phillipson, however, insists that while the harpoon heads and the wavy line pottery are remarkably uniform “the chipped-stone industries show considerable variation” and may be based on earlier local traditions.21 The equally distinguished archaeologist Alison Brooks insists that, given geological differences, lithic cultures over large regions cannot be uniform.22 Thus, the uniformity of the wavy line pottery and uniserial harpoons provides sufficient evidence to justify seeing this material culture as coherent. The location of the finds near former lakes or water courses and the presence of harpoons both indicate that the society was “aquatic,” or based on abundant fish, turtles, crustaceans and other water life. In this connection, Roger Blench has demonstrated a common vocabulary for many of these creatures, one that cuts across African language families.23 The archaeologist and geographer of the Sahara, G. Camps has claimed that the presence of pottery in the same sites indicates that agriculture was there in this early period. He argues that, although agricultural sites without pottery have been excavated, “the opposite has not yet been clearly demonstrated.”24 Typologically this statement is mistaken. The Japanese Jo|mon pottery, roughly contemporary with
Khartoum Mesolithic, was made by people who lived off seafood, completely without agriculture. All that pottery indicates is settlement in one place. Nomads cannot use pottery, which is too fragile to travel. The abundant aquatic life in the Holocene Sahara would have allowed for intensive settlement. The settlers’ livelihood was enlarged by the hunting of hippopotami with multiple harpoons in a way still practiced by the Songhai on the upper Niger and, thousands of miles to the east, the Elmolo on Lake Turkana. Camps plausibly backs his argument for the existence of agriculture not merely by the increasing presence of grindstones and mullers or abraders in the Saharan sites, but also by remains of what he sees as cultivated pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from a stratum he dates to about 6000 BCE.25 The editor of the relevant volume of The Cambridge History of Africa, J. Desmond Clark, was clearly unhappy with Camps’s conclusion and inserted a subversive footnote doubting it.

Later discoveries in the oases of the Egyptian Western Desert, however, have tended to confirm Camps’s early dates for the cultivation of millet.26 The relative uniformity of this Saharan material culture (pace Phillipson) and its approximate beginning in the Tenth Millennium BP have been established. Two major problems remain: where did this culture originate and is there any indication of what language or languages its users spoke? David Phillipson argues that, “The degree of similarity between these Saharan industries and broadly contemporary material from southern Tunisia, supports the view that the initial repopulation of the Sahara may have taken from the North.”27 People from all directions probably joined in the Saharan landrush. Nevertheless, Phillipson’s suggestion that the predominant group came from the north is implausible. His caution and the word “broadly” were both necessary because Camps has argued that the Neolithic of the Capsian tradition was later and more impoverished materially than both the Mediterranean Neolithic on the coast and the Saharan-Sudanese Neolithic to the south. Camps had previously stated that “there is an evergrowing difficulty in defining precisely the boundary line between the Epipaleolithic (or the Mesolithic) and the Neolithic.”28 It is unlikely that the Saharan culture developed along the Nile. True, the wavy line pottery did overlap in time with the last Sudanese Epipaleolithic cultures. In addition, the recent discovery of designs, possibly of fish traps, dated to 8000 BP at El Hosh, between Edfu and Assuan shows that the Nile Valley was not uninhabited during the Holocene.29 Nevertheless, as mentioned in the previous chapter, it is overwhelmingly likely that the population of the Middle and Lower Nile fell drastically in the Holocene after its peaks during the Ice Age. Camps points out that “at the period with which we are concerned [after the Tenth Millennium BP] these Nile countries were not in any way more privileged than the Saharan regions of Bahr el-Ghazal [southwestern Sudan] or the Ténéré [in northern Niger].”30 He suggests that the Saharan culture came from the west. Several early carbon datings from the south Sahara go back to the Tenth Millennium BP and appear to be slightly earlier than the dates associated with pottery found near Khartoum.31 If the place of origin of the earliest pottery in Africa—or, for that matter, the western world—cannot be located more accurately than the southern Sahara, prototypes for other aspects of the Saharan culture



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 65
suggests a southeastern origin. Most strikingly, southeastern precedents exist for the uniserial harpoons found in the Sudanese-Saharan Neolithic. One likely antecedent is indicated by harpoon finds from Ishango near Lake Edward on the Congo-Uganda border.32 Previous doubts about the antiquity of the finds have now been settled and the earliest strata containing bone harpoons are clearly much more than twenty thousand years old.33 Even more startling are the harpoons found at Katanda, seven kilometers downstream; they date to 90,000 BP.34 As its excavator John Yellen points out, the seventy thousand-year gap makes this tradition by far the longest lasting nonlithic material culture attested anywhere.35 This early date makes it impossible that the harpoon was borrowed from the Magdalenian culture in Europe, where it is first attested around 20,000 BP.36 In the earlier levels at Ishango the harpoons were barbed on both sides and appear to have developed from arrowheads. The notch to attach a line came later, and uniserial barbs later still. Phillipson, who did not know of the Katanda dates, wrote that:
Ishango, which is the most southerly of the East African harpoon fishing sites, is also the oldest. It and some of the Lake Turkana sites show that this adaptation developed significantly before the local beginning of pottery manufacture. When pottery did appear its earliest East African manifestation showed strong similarities with those of the Sudanese Nile valley.37
With the Holocene these uniserial harpoons appear to spread throughout Africa. They have been found from the Kalahari to Morocco.38 As mentioned in the last chapter, some of the Nile Valley cultures used microliths as early as 17,000 BP. It is unlikely, however, that the Saharan microliths derived from these, even though the culture that produced Early Khartoum wavy line pottery overlapped in time with the Later Nile Epipaleolithic cultures. As the geo-archaeologist Karl Butzer pointed out “the lithic assemblages are clearly different and intrusive.”39 Intrusive from where? To the southeast the pattern is patchy with older stone industries surviving for much longer in many places. Interestingly, however, at Matupi Cave in northeastern Congo, less that 200 kilometers from Ishango, a microlithic industry was active at least thirty thousand years ago. Ishango itself, like many other sites in the region, shows no sign of this advanced industry.40 Information about stone industries in western Africa is scanty and unreliable. Phillipson argues that “microlithic technology in West Africa began at least 12,000 years ago.”41



66 BLACK ATHENA
Thus, although the harpoons can clearly be derived from the southeast, the microlithic stone tools of the Saharan cultures of the Holocene could have come from anywhere to the south of the previous desert. The same is true of pottery and agriculture.42 The most widespread of the Saharan stone assemblages has been called Ténéréan. This beautiful microlithic industry is named after finds in the Ténéré desert in northern Niger. That location, however, is near the western edge of its range. This industry stretched 2000 kilometers to the east to the White Nile above Khartoum.43 The culture was initially largely aquatic and grass grinding. By the Eighth Millennium BP animals were domesticated: sheep and goats from southwest Asia and cattle that had been domesticated locally.44 Bones and wonderful rock paintings of the so-called Bovidian period attest to the existence of these animals. The paintings show bicolored cattle—the result of deliberate breedingand milking. Customs later found among Egyptians, such as tying single legs of a row of calves with one cord also appear. In this connection it is interesting to note Camps’s emphasis on the close similarities between Ténéréan and Egyptian fine geometrically shaped flint tools: “the resemblances between the industries are to be found also in the domain of art.”45
The Western Desert
Let us now consider the oases of the Egyptian Western Desert, the easternmost region of the Sahara. Greater activity occurred along the line of oases to the west of the Nile from Nabta Playa on the south to the Fayoum and Qattara to the north, than along the river itself. Some centuries of Mediterranean rains in the Seventh Millennium BP occurred in the northern half of the belt. Nevertheless, this band was not the wellwatered “paradise” of the central Sahara. Wendorf and Hassan described the general pattern: “The vegetation was most likely thin and concentrated around ephemeral lakes. It was an arid open desert steppe with wild grasses, thorn bushes and occasional acacia and tamarisk trees.”46 Culturally, the band was a zone of contact. Clearly, there were survivals of the old Middle Nile tool-making traditions. On the other hand, one uniserial harpoon and some wavy line pottery have been found, although development of the latter seems to have been inhibited by the abundance of ostrich shells, remains of which were plentiful on the sites.47 Sorghum, possibly domesticated, was consumed at least as far north as



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 67
Farafra. Bones of domestic cattle have been found at Nabta Playa. All these provide evidence of contacts to the southwest. On the other hand sheep, not cattle, were herded at Farafra in the Eighth Millennium BP, a fact that indicates influence from southwest Asia.48
The languages of the Sahara during the Holocene
What language or languages were spoken by the people of the Saharan civilization? A quarter of a century ago, the archaeologist John Sutton proposed that the language was Nilo-Saharan. He used four arguments to justify his claim: first, a geographical correspondence of the material remains of the aquatic civilization to the present distribution of NiloSaharan; second, the identification of both the aquatic civilization and Nilo-Saharan with “negroid peoples”; third, the fact that many NiloSaharan speakers are now fishermen and, fourth, a Cushitic taboo against fish shows a distinction between Cushitic-speaking cattle herders and “negroid” fishermen.”49 Sutton’s hypotheses contain just the kind of bold thinking required in African, or any, prehistory, where, as it cannot be emphasized too often, one is dealing with competing plausibilities not certainties. Despite some quibbles by other writers he has demonstrated the existence of an aquatic civilization by the Tenth Millennium BP.50 Sutton’s linguistic conclusions are much less certain than his prehistorical hypothesis. First, Greenberg’s concept of a Nilo-Saharan super-family has not been accepted by all scholars.51 Second, even if one accepts this concept, the great diversity of this super-family indicates that its disintegration took place well before 10,000 BP. The present distribution of Nilo-Saharan languages overlaps with the regions occupied by the aquatic civilization. The correspondence, however, is far from being as clear as Sutton suggested. His best case is that of the Songhai in the upper Niger, who speak a Nilo-Saharan language and still hunt hippopotami with harpoons in the way of the aquatic civilization.52 Sutton himself admitted that Lake Chad was fished by Chadic (Afroasiatic speakers) and further added, in a footnote, that in two aquatic civilization areas that appear to fit most neatly Nilo-Saharan speech and speakers arrived at quite a late date.53 His statement also applies to another region in which wavy line pottery and uniserial harpoons have been found: around Lake Turkana, in northern Kenya.54 There the



68 BLACK ATHENA
Elmolo people, living on islands in the lake, fish and hunt hippopotami in the traditional way and speak Turkana, a Nilo-Saharan language.55 These people, however, changed their language from a Cushitic to a Nilo-Saharan one in living memory.56 In general, eastern Nilo-Saharan speakers arrived in the region as cattle herders and sorghum growers during the last three or four millennia.57 It is also generally agreed that East Sudanic River Nubian, spoken between the fifth and first cataracts of the Nile, came from the west. Sutton argues that they were preceded in the region by other Nubian speakers, possibly including among those Meroitic, the dead language spoken in the Egyptianized civilization that flourished around its capital Meroë above the fifth cataract.58 After repeated attempts scholars have still failed to link Meroitic to Nilo-Saharan.59 Thus, we can be sure that speakers of many different languages have lived around the Upper Nile, including the Afroasiatic-speaking Beja.60 It also seems that only two of the terms associated with aquatic “hippopotamus” and possibly “fish” can be traced to Proto-Nilo-Saharan.61 Others, such as boat, net, fishhook, bone harpoon, bow and pot, have not so far been found. The makers of the Khartoum Neolithic culture appear to have been direct descendents of those of the Khartoum Mesolithic.62 William Adams, an expert on Nubian history and prehistory, writes, “the Khartoum Mesolithic has a distinctly African rather than a Near Eastern flavour.” Therefore, he argues that these Mesolithic people might well have been ancestors of the present Nilo-Saharan–speaking Nubians.63 This is not necessarily the case if, as I argue, Proto-Afroasiatic speakers were also “African.”
The origins of Afroasiatic and the Saharan aquatic civilization
If there are few common Nilo-Saharan roots for elements of the Saharan aquatic civilization, a number of terms associated with that civilization occur in Proto-Afroasiatic. The most important of these is qs “bone” found in Berber, Chadic, Lowland East Cushitic and even Omotic.64 The Semitic attestation for qs has been disputed, but the number of triliterals semantically related to this base, make the attestation extremely probable. Qrsl/n “small bones” occurs in Akkadian and



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 69
Canaanite and, with an initial k-, in Arabic.65 Qss in Arabic is “to suck the marrow” from a bone. The uniserial harpoons of the Sahara were made of bone. In this respect, the Egyptian qs “bone” is particularly
interesting because its hieroglyphic determinative å(T19) gives a pre
cise picture of a “uniserial barbed harpoon.” The central significance of
this image is demonstrated by the representation of wŒ “one” by A
(T21) “uniserial harpoon” and sn “two” by a (T22) “double-sided
arrow.”66 Triliterals also reflect the other aspect of “bone harpoon.” There is the Egyptian qÅs “strong bow, string a bow, bind.” The Hungarian lexicographer of Ancient Egyptian Gabor Takács sees this form as cognate with metathesis to the Semitic qsr “bind, compel.”67 Another triliteral, qws alternating with qys “bow, arrow” is found in Semitic, Chadic and South Cushitic.68 Y/nqs+means “fowler” or “to ensnare” in Ugaritic and Hebrew. A derivative môqes+found in the Book of Job has caused great difficulties to translators. The description is of a struggle with the Behemoth-Crocodile (or hippopotamus) in which môqe\sî+m (plural) are used to pierce his nose. The commentator Marvin Pope puzzled, “the verb ‘pierce’ does not suit the action of a snare or trap.” He then cites numerous attempts to solve the dilemma.69 This can be resolved by considering the following description of traditional hippopotamus hunting on the Niger, “ Sometimes over a hundred hunters pelt the animals with harpoons. The beast becomes entangled in the lines and vegetation and eventually sinks.”70 Apparently related roots ÷qos “strike, pierce” and ÷kos “pierce, cut” occur in most Chadic and other Afroasiatic languages.71
The root ÷ h≥r “net, trap, capture”
The root ÷h≥r “to net, trap, capture.” appears widely in Egyptian, Chadic and Semitic. The Egyptian triliterals are h≥Åm “to catch fish,” h≥Åd “fish trap,” h≥Åq “to plunder, capture,”  ̇Åti “fine linen, cloudiness,”  ̇Åyt “bandage.” In Hausa there are hard “to enmesh” and harg “to fasten, embroil” or “small harpoon.” Semitic contains  ̇rm “to net, to fish,”  ̇rz “to string together,”  ̇rg “confined” and  ̇rs “entangle.”72



70 BLACK ATHENA
The root *db “hippopotamus”
The Russian lexicographers of Afroasiatic, Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova describe the Afroasiatic root ÷dab as “big animal” by basing this description on the Semitic ÷dabb/dubb “bear.”73 It seems more plausible to begin with the Egyptian db “hippopotamus.” The first reason for this preference is the Arabic use of the root ÷dabb “to creep, crawl.” More importantly, another Afroasiatic root ÷dab “to trample flat” is found in Semitic and West Chadic.74 Such a term is entirely appropriate for hippopotami who flatten the land hundreds of feet around their pools during their night feedings. The Hausa word for hippopotamus is dorina. The Afroasiatic root survives in that language, however, in daba “to collect, surround as hunters.” Then there is dabilbila “to trample up ground.” The base ÷dbl could also explain a root ÷dbn, found in the Egyptian dbn “go around a place, encircle.” Takács relates dbn to Semitic roots ÷dabl or ÷dibl “round.”75 Orel and Stolbova see a root ÷dabin “enclosure.”76 Thus, Proto-Afroasiatic appears to have had a common word for the animal and for its hunting, both of which were central to the aquatic civilization.
Plant harvesting and cultivation?
The evidence strongly suggests that Proto-Afroasiatic had a common vocabulary suitable to the aquatic civilization. It is possible to find common roots indicating Neolithic culture if we bear in mind Camps’s warning about the difficulty of distinguishing between the Saharan Epipaleolithic and Neolithic.77 There are a number of common NiloSaharan agricultural terms for “field,” “herd,” “cow” and “goat.” Blench and Ehret, however, argue separately that their distribution indicates they originally came from Afroasiatic.78 Indeed, Orel and Stolbova list scores of common Afroasiatic terms for domestic animals and plants and their collection and harvesting; these can be found in their Hamito-Semitic Etymological Dictionary.79 Some of these may not indicate that the speakers of Proto-Afroasiatic lived in a Neolithic society since the terms could have been derived from names given to wild plants. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that all can be explained away in this manner. Different branches of the super-family are still less likely to have adapted words for hoeing and planting independently from preagricultural concepts. To give a few examples from Orel and Stolbova: § 2377, *tat- “to sow, plant” in Central Chadic and South Cushitic; § 1106, *Œog “to dig, cut, hoe” found in



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 71
Egyptian and East Chadic; § 1365 *h°ubV “to hoe, till” Semitic, Egyptian and West Chadic; § 1738/9 *mar “hoe” Semitic, Egyptian, Chadic and Highland East Cushitic; § 2177, *sak “hoe” West Chadic, Egyptian, Berber, Semitic; § 566, *c$ud/c$a>ad “harrow” Chadic, Egyptian, Semitic. Thus, it would seem that Afroasiatic spread with the aquatic civilization and then, or very soon after with herding and agriculture.
African Afroasiatic
The name “Afroasiatic” comes from the fact that languages of this family are spoken in both Africa and Asia. The “Afro-”comes before the “-Asiatic” because seven of its eight subfamilies Chadic, South Cushitic, Central Cushitic, East Cushitic, Beja, Berber and Ancient Egyptian are, or were, spoken exclusively in Africa and the seventh, Semitic is spoken on both continents.80 This ratio is obscured by the facts that by far the best known member of this family is the Semitic subfamily of languages and that Arabic—a Semitic language from Asia—is today spoken as a mother tongue or is culturally dominant in over 90 percent of the territory where Afroasiatic has traditionally been spoken. There have been a number of hypotheses about the Urheimat of Afroasiatic and, not surprisingly, most of them place it in Africa, although a more precise location is still controversial. Before looking at these debates, it is worth considering the modern successors to the earlier views that the family came from Asia. From these theories came the super-family’s first name, Semito-Hamitic.
Militarev and the theory of Asiatic origin (map 3a)
The idea of an Asiatic origin has, I believe, been a factor in leading a number of scholars, notably the Russian scholars A. Yu Militarev and V. A. Shnirelman, to propose that Afroasiatic originated as the language corresponding to the Natufian material culture of the Eleventh Millennium BCE in Syria and Palestine, referred to in the last chapter.81 Militarev’s proposal can be backed by the example of southwest Asian crops and stock in north Africa and by the fact that the Levant is relatively close to the original homelands of the other Nostratic language families. The scheme, however, presents four difficulties. In the first place, as I have argued above, southwest Asia was not the sole source of agriculture



72 BLACK ATHENA
in the general region. Also, the hypothesis cannot explain the deep diversity of Afroasiatic language families in Africa and the great variety of languages within these families. Blench points out that the Afroasiatic languages in southwest Asia are “very undiverse” in general an indication of late development.82 Third, an Asiatic origin for Afroasiatic leaves unsolved the location of Omotic, now spoken in southwest Ethiopia. Omotic is widely agreed to be the earliest separate branch of the superfamily.83 Last, such an origin makes it difficult to explain a central feature, not found in Nostratic and among other African languages, that Afroasiatic shares with a number of Khoisan languages: binary sexual gender.84 Nevertheless, Militarev and Shnirelman have been supported on genetic grounds by Luigi Cavalli-Svorza and his colleagues who explain the similarities between the populations of southwest Asia and north Africa as the result of a reflux from Asia to Africa.85 Against this, the physical anthropologist Shomarka Keita argues that the movement was really in the other direction; that is to say, that Asians and Europeans genetically resemble eastern and north Africans because they derive from these parts of the continent.86 Furthermore, not only have recent works shown skeletal evidence of Khoisan presence in Ethiopia but also some studies demonstrate a close genetic relationship between Khoisan and Oromo and Amharic-speakers of Afroasiatic in central Ethiopia. Suggesting to the authors a population continuum across Africa from south to east.87 As the anthropologist Daniel Mc Call has argued, however, in the case of Afroasiatic at least, one should be wary of linking ancient genetics to a more recent language.88
African origins
All other major hypotheses on the location of the origin of Afroasiatic put it in Africa. The question of where on the continent it should be placed has been affected by what many scholars see as a fundamental distinction between the northern Afroasiatic languages—Berber, Egyptian and Semitic with many triconsonantal roots—and the southern languages—South, East and Central Cushitic; Beja; Chadic and Omotic which have only a few of these roots.
DIAKONOFF (MAP 3B). For most of his life, the Russian linguist and historian I. M. Diakonoff who, among many other achievements, pioneered



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 73
Afroasiatic studies, placed the Urheimat in the Sahara.89 Diakonoff proposed that no later than the Sixth Millennium BCE Afroasiatic split into northern and southern branches.90 The northern branch remained in the desert and developed triconsonantalism, while the southern branch moved south of the Sahara and retained the original biconsonantal system. The southern branch divided into the western Chadic and the eastern Cushitic branches. Within the northern branch this scheme requires Egyptian to have split off from Berber and Semitic. When the latter two separated, Semitic passed through the Nile Delta to reach southwest Asia.91 The idea of an origin in the Holocene Sahara is attractive because of the Proto-Afroasiatic terms associated with the aquatic civilization and mentioned above. Nevertheless, apart from the same difficulties affecting the Levantine hypothesis, three further problems affect Diakonoff ’s scheme: First, how does one explain the special lexical affinities between Egyptian and Chadic? Second, the Chadic languages become more uniform as one moves from east to west.92 This indicates a spread in this direction, not from north to south. Third, apparently for many millennia Nilo-Saharan speakers occupied much of the desert that was unaffected by the Holocene climatic improvement. Some of them still live there.
OREL AND STOLBOVA (MAP 3C). The lexicographers of Afroasiatic, Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova, put forward a different scheme. They see the basic division as between two groups: First is between “Cushmotic” and others. Cushmotic includes all the Cushitic families and Omotic. Orel and Stolbova see this grouping not as genetic but as an ancient areal Sprachbund. The second division is between Chadic and Egyptian, on the one hand, and Berber and Semitic, on the other. Thus, for them the distinction between bi- and triconsonantalism is insignificant.93
EHRET (MAP 3D). The historian and linguist Christopher Ehret sees the original home of Afroasiatic speakers as along the Red Sea coast from Eritrea to southeastern Egypt.94 He envisions the first branching as that of Omotic from the rest, which he calls Erythraic. He then sees a northsouth division. He does not, however, strictly associate this with tri- as opposed to biconsonantalism, because he sees the Chadic speakers who largely used biconsonantal roots as having moved south across the Sahara from the Maghreb.95 The academic reason for this hypothesis is



74 BLACK ATHENA
what he sees as the frequency of lexical parallels between Chadic and Ancient Egyptian and Berber. (I shall take up the first issue below.) Against Ehret’s hypothesis is the point, made above, that the apparent movement of Chadic speakers was from east to west rather than from north to south. Furthermore, although languages of two Afroasiatic families, Beja and Semitic, have been spoken for a long time in the region Ehret proposes as the Urheimat, it is not the region with the greatest diversity of Afroasiatic families or languages.
BLENCH (MAP 3E). Another view is that of the agriculturalist and linguist Roger Blench. While he, too, believes in the importance of the distinction between northern and southern Afroasiatic, in addition, he suggests a different scenario. He proposes that the Urheimat is in the Omo Valley in southwest Ethiopia. People who remained in the valley became the Omotic speakers. After that division, Blench sees a further divide between North and South Afroasiatic. He believes that North Afroasiatic traveled down the Nile, then branched east to form Semitic and west to form Berber. He associates the Semitic speakers with the Natufian material culture in Syro-Palestine and the Berbers with the preagricultural Capsians, whose material culture appears to have derived from Natufian.96 He then faces the problem of why Berber has such relatively little variation if it is so ancient (± 7000 BP) and has been spoken over so wide an area. His answer is that with “a constant pattern of migration” Berber may have reached an “equilibrium state,” a term the linguist Robert Dixon uses to describe the relative uniformity of most Australian languages.97 According to Blench, Egyptian speakers remained on the Nile and in the eastern Sahara where the language was heavily influenced by Chadic speakers. These Chadic speakers themselves had moved due west from the original Urheimat at a later date, around 4000 BP.98 Speakers of the other South Afroasiatic languages moved east dividing into the Beja and the East, Central and South branches of Cushitic.99 This hypothesis avoids the substantial population and cultural movements required by the ideas of Militarev and Diakonoff and provides a more plausible explanation of the distribution of Chadic languages than Ehret offers. Blench also tries to avoid the genetic explanation of Chadic-Egyptian and ChadicBerber relations and argues that the many lexical parallels are the result of later loans. Connections with Egyptian, however, are difficult to make if Chadic speakers only reached the southern Sahara in the Second



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 75
Millennium BCE. His proposed Urheimat is also rather too far north for what he would call the Hadzic (and I, the Khoisan) influences on ProtoAfroasiatic, in which we both believe.
BENDER (MAP 3F). The leading specialist in Ethiopian languages, Lionel Bender proposes the confluence of the White and Blue Niles as the source of Afroasiatic. Beginning about 10,000 BP, he sees a series of “explosions.” The first sent Chadic far to the west and Omotic to the southeast. Soon after, Egyptian moved down the Nile, leaving Berber, Semitic and Cushitic behind.100 He is skeptical of the common belief in a special relationship between Egyptian and Chadic. He attributes this belief to a greater scholarly knowledge of Chadic than of the Cushitic “branches.”101 The second “explosion” sent Berber to the northwest while Semitic and Cushitic moved into what is now Ethiopia. A final split was between Cushitic and Semitic; the latter moved across the Bab el Mandeb straits at the southern end of the Red Sea. Then through Arabia to its later range. Bender insists that the key grammatical isomorphs within Afroasiatic link Egyptian, Semitic, Berber and Cushitic. Where Diakonoff dismissed the sporadic occurrence of triliterals in Cushitic as unimportant, Bender sees them as significant. Similarly, he emphasizes the fact that both prefix and suffix conjugations, standard in Semitic and Berber, also appear from time to time in Cushitic.102 Bender generously acknowledges the influence on this scheme of an unpublished paper, I presented in 1980.103 Nevertheless, we have some significant differences. In the first place, where he proposes an Urheimat at the confluence of the two Niles, I argued that Afroasiatic originated around the Rift Valley in southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Bender and I both accept the conventional view that the separation of the rest of the super-family from Omotic—a family that Bender was the first scholar to define—was the earliest division. Omotic has very low percentages of basic vocabulary cognates with other Afroasiatic languages.104 Equally important, Omotic lies outside a significant number of Bender’s morphological isoglosses.105 On the other hand, Omotic shares enough Afroasiatic features—/s/ causative, /t/ intransitive and the noun plural in /n/—for there to be little doubt of its membership in the family.106 Several scholars have gone further to suggest that the concept of a “Cushitic” language family is not useful.107 While all members are linked by morphological similarities, these are not exclusively “Cushitic” but



76 BLACK ATHENA
are shared by other members of Afroasiatic. Bender avoids this problem by constructing a “Macro-Cushitic.” In his construction of Afroasiatic as a whole, he now sees an initial three-way split: Chadic-Central-Omotic. Later, Central branched into Egyptian and Macro-Cushitic and, last, Macro-Cushitic into Berber-Semitic-Cushitic.108
BERNAL 1980 (MAP 3G). I do not believe that the split between Chadic and the rest was as fundamental as Bender supposes. In 1980, I saw the non-Omotic “branches” of Afroasiatic as having “exploded” relatively quickly, within a thousand years. The possible reasons why an “explosion” can be the best model for a linguistic family, come under three headings. First, a large state that had previously established overall linguistic unity could collapse with the resulting breakdown of communication among its segments. The best historical examples of such breakups are the western Roman Empire, the Muslim Caliphate and Tang China. In all three cases, however, strong centripetal forces survived; a unified subpolitical religion in the first two and later political, though not linguistic, reunifications in China. The existence and disintegration of a political state in Africa around 11,000 BP, however, is, to say the least, extremely unlikely. The second reason for an apparent linguistic “explosion” might be the migration of speakers of a language away from each other with a resulting loss of contact. This migration would have to occur in so short a period that no linguistic innovations would take place between the splits. Such a change could have happened in the case of Afroasiatic but it is less likely than the third possibility. In the third model, changes may have taken place between bifurcations but these would not be significant enough to be evident because of later contacts between branches or other “noise” that increases with time. Thus, the more distant the period in which a series of separations took place the less easy it is to distinguish relative differences between them. To give a concrete example, the rapid expansion of Bantu was “by African standards a very rapid one.”109 Nevertheless, through lexico-statistics it is possible to pick up fine differences between bifurcations that happened within a century or two of each other.110 Those we are considering, however, took place over the last three millennia. If we were to look at the Bantu family over eight thousand years, it would almost certainly be impossible to detect the order in which splits occurred, let alone have any idea of the time that had elapsed between them. We seem to be in



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 77
this position in the investigation of Afroasiatic. The accumulated “noise” of ten thousand years deafens us to the fine distinctions. Thus, to say that the Afroasiatic super-family is the result of an “explosion,” not a “tree,” is not to claim that it developed as fast as, say, Bantu. Nevertheless, this statement does suggest that, with the exception of the split with Omotic, the whole process took less than a millennium.111 In 1980, I believed that such a scheme would explain the fact that the structural isoglosses connecting Afroasiatic families as set out by Diakonoff and Bender are remarkably uniform.112 Very much the same picture emerges from Bender’s tables of lexical similarities based on his modified version of Swadesh’s 100-word list. While it is true that Berber, Egyptian and Semitic share a high percentage of cognates, so too does Proto-Chadic; only “Cushitic” and Omotic score significantly lower.113 Even excluding Omotic, there appears to be no common “Cushitic,” as opposed to Afroasiatic, vocabulary. The Central Cushitic language of Awngi and the “Northern Cushitic” Beja have a cognate percentage of 7 percent and Beja and the South Cushitic language of Iraqw (spoken in northern Tanzania) have 10 percent. These figures are of the same order as the 7 percent Bender gives between Proto-Bantu and PIE and the 8 percent between PIE and Akkadian. As a linguistic family “Cushitic” even fails Bender’s minimum requirement that any member of the family should not have a higher percentage of cognates with an outside language than the average percentage within the group.114 Phonologically, nothing distinguishes “Cushitic” languages from any other Afroasiatic language family. It still seems to me, pace Bender, that the most plausible way in which to interpret this information is to follow Diakonoff, Ehret and Orel and Stolbova in associating Semitic, Berber, Egyptian and Chadic.115
BERNAL 2003 (MAP 3H). Since 1980, I have changed my views. I still maintain that the Urheimat of Afroasiatic was in southern Ethiopia or northern Kenya. The linguistic reasons for this preference are the principles of diversity and least movement. The Ethiopian Rift Valley is close to the present location of Omotic speakers. It is also the region with the greatest number not only of Afroasiatic language families but of languages within those families.116 The linguistic and the archaeological indications differ, however. The zone of maximum diversity within Afroasiatic is in the southern Ethiopian highlands. Against this zone is the absence of material evidence from this period around the Ethiopian



78 BLACK ATHENA
Rift lakes, which were dry during the Ice Age. Three or four hundred kilometers farther south, however, on the shores of Lake Turkana, harpoons developed very early.117 This line of thinking moves the Urheimat some distance away from the center of Afroasiatic diversity but it does put the location inside regions where Khoisan was spoken.
Relations between Central Khoisan and Afroasiatic
The idea of an Urheimat of Afroasiatic in the Rift Valley is reinforced by the strong possibility of links with Khoisan. While most Khoisan speakers are now in southern Africa, two languages, Hadza and Sandawe, are still spoken by hunter-gatherers in Tanzania.118 Although it has very few lexical parallels with the Khoisan languages spoken farther south, Sandawe would seem to be distantly related not only because it shares the rare feature of clicks but also because it has similar constraints on what can be used as a second consonant.119 The position of Hadza, which has clicks but lacks these constraints, is less secure. Roger Blench classifies it as an isolate “with reasonable certainty.”120 On the other hand, Christopher Ehret sees it as an outer member of the Khoisan family.121 According to Bonnie Sands, Hadza and Sandawe share “large numbers of [lexical] similarities,” but she went on to argue that these could as easily come from later contact as from a genetic relationship.122 Some factors indicate a possible connection between Khoisan languages and early Afroasiatic. First, at a phonological level, as the linguist Amanda Miller-Ockhuizen argues, Khoisan gutteral clicks could be considered as clearer articulations of gutterals—laryngeal and pharyngeal. Such gutterals and the constraints against their coincidence in a root resemble those found in some Afroasiatic and, particularly, Semitic languages.123 There appear to be particular parallels between Ethiopic Afroasiatic and Central Khoisan languages: KhoeKhoe or Nama, Nharo, ||Ganakhoe, Shuakhoe and Tshwa are all spoken in a band from Namibia to Zimbabwe. Morphologically, if one accepts Greenberg’s sequence that deictics become articles and on to gender markers, the Nama masculine singular marker -p becomes interesting.124 It would fit with the -b as a masculine suffix in Dime and the third-person base -b- in the Ometic languages Gonga, Janjero and Ometo and also -b- as a masculine single marker in Beja.125 Then there is the deictic masculine singular



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 79
p- in Egyptian. Too much, however, should not be made from this single example as none of the other suffixes match. Syntactically it is worth noting that the pattern subject-object-verb (SOV), found in the Central Khoisan languages and Sandawe though not in Hadza, is shared by nearly all Ethiopian Afroasiatic languages both Semitic and Cushitic. While none of these parallels is strong in its own right, their conjunction makes them rather more substantial. They are in fact reinforced by the possibility that the Afroasiatic gender system was borrowed from Khoisan. Whatever their relationship with the Khoisan of southern Africa, both Sandawe and Hadza share with Central Khoisan the features of number and binary sex-linked gender.126 The North and South Khoisan languages do not possess sex gender. Normally, one expects the periphery to retain archaic features. Thus, the existence of binary sexgender in Hadza and Sandawe and in Kwadi, an isolated Khoisan language once spoken in Angola, makes it unlikely that the form is an innovation in Central Khoisan. It is also striking that while Takács lists four loans into Egyptian from Central Khoisan he finds none from the northern or southern branches.127 Other linguistic features also suggest that Central Khoisan rather than North and South Khoisan had connections with Proto-Afroasiatic. First, Central has a richer morphology than the “non-Khoe” languages.128 Linguists have long recognized that, while inflected languages frequently “break down” to become isolating, isolating languages can often turn particles into morphological features. Nevertheless, even though this breakdown cannot be used to claim that Khoe is more archaic than the northern or southern branches, it does show that the language resembles Afroasiatic.129 Equally, while Hadza and Sandawe could have borrowed gender from Afroasiatic, such a loan would have been virtually impossible for Central Khoisan, which now has no neighbor with sex-gendered language for two thousand miles. The fact that neither South nor North Khoisan possesses this feature is best explained by their having lost it through long contact with Bantu speakers whose language has a multiple gender or class system.130 In Africa, sex-linked gender only occurs in some Khoisan languages and Afroasiatic.131 In Indo-European it appears as a secondary feature; this fact will be discussed in the next chapter. As Greenberg pointed out, apart from Indo-European, “other branches of Euroasiatic do not have grammatical gender.”132



80 BLACK ATHENA
A number of writers are skeptical about any attempt to establish genetic relations between Khoisan and Afroasiatic or Indo-European languages on this basis.133 Derek Elderkin, a specialist in South Cushitic languages, argued that genetic relationship is not the only form of connection and suggested what he called an “areal,” neither genetic nor contact, basis for relations between the South Cushitic and Khoisan languages.134 As we are considering people, I cannot see how “areal” can avoid the idea of contact. Indeed the genetic relationship between Khoisan and Ethiopic Afroasiatic speakers, mentioned above, raises the possibility that Proto-Afroasiatic was originally a Nostratic overlay on a Khoisan-speaking population.135 An apparent example of this possibility on a small scale is Dahalo spoken by a subordinate caste on the Kenya coast; this language is South Cushitic with clicks.136 Copying of sex-linked binary gender from Khoisan into Proto-Afroasiatic would explain why Afroasiatic would be the only Nostratic language family to possess gender as a fundamental feature.137 Given the vast lexical divergence within Khoisan, it is extremely difficult to trace any lexical borrowings from these languages into Proto-Afroasiatic. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, Takács has proposed four plausible cognates between Khoisan and Egyptian.138 Less surprisingly, Ehret sees other important ones in South Cushitic.139 To sum up this section, three explanations could cover the existence of binary grammatical sex-gender in both Central Khoisan and Afroasiatic: First, the existence of sex-linked gender in both languages is merely a coincidence; second, Proto-Afroasiatic borrowed the construction from Khoisan and third, Afroasiatic is the result of the imposition of a Nostratic language on a Khoisan-speaking population. The arguments in favor of the first explanation are that sex-linked gender, although rare, is not a unique feature among world languages. Furthermore, the Khoe system is unlike Afroasiatic in possessing an indefinite form that can sometimes function as a neuter. Finally, the only possible phonetic parallel among the gender markers is the -p mentioned above. Against these possibilities are the arguments in favor of explanations two and three. In favor of borrowing is the, admittedly circular, argument of geographical proximity with sex-gendered Khoisan languages, if one accepts an Ethiopian or Kenyan Urheimat for Afroasiatic. The linguistic and cultural mixing in southern Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania has already been mentioned. There is also the fact that binary sex-gender sys



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 81
tems are not merely rare in the world but unique in Africa. Against these are the arguments in favor of the first explanation and those for the third. The following case can be made for the third explanation: it is undoubtedly possible that anything can be borrowed from one language to another, indeed in Chapter 4 I shall argue that Indo-European borrowed the feminine gender from Afroasiatic. On the other hand, the more superficial aspects of a language, i.e. words, are more likely to be borrowed than the fundamental ones like phonetics and basic structural features. The latter would certainly include gender. Therefore, while there is no trace of the characteristic Khoisan clicks in Afroasiatic (as there are in Dahalo and the South Bantu languages Xhosa and Zulu), the similarity of gender systems can be explained as the result of a Khoisan substrate to Proto-Afroasiatic. Finally, although it is always risky to confuse genetic with linguistic arguments, Semino and her colleagues have found a close genetic similarity between Khoisan and Ethiopian Afroasiatic speakers.140 All in all, I find the arguments for the third explanation the most persuasive.
The disintegration of Afroasiatic
Given the difficulties in establishing distinct bifurcations in the family, apart from that involving Omotic, and given the great time span, it still seems useful to envisage an “explosion.” For instance, I find it a waste of time to classify “Cushitic” or Chadic as “in” or “out” of Central Afroasiatic. I now accept, however, that one cannot overlook the significance of triliteralism and agree that development in this direction increased in the northern range of Afroasiatic. Before coming to this discussion, I should like to consider the spread of some of the other branches of Afroasiatic. South Cushitic moved south into what is now Tanzania. Some East Cushitic speakers stayed in southern Ethiopia and others moved east to Somalia. Both South and East Cushitic languages probably replaced Khoisan. This substitution can be seen most clearly in Dahalo. The Central Cushitic speakers moved north to central Ethiopia and the Beja or North Cushitic speakers went still further to their present territory in the north of Eritrea and along the Sudanese and southern Egyptian coasts of the Red Sea.141 As mentioned above, Chadic speakers spread west as far as northern



82 BLACK ATHENA
Nigeria, although the initial territory through which they passed was inhabited by Nilo-Saharan speakers. Unlike Blench, however, I believe that the contacts with Ancient Egyptian indicate that the movement reached the southern Sahara considerably before his suggested date of 4000 BP.142 As many of these cognate forms appear in Egyptian texts of the Old Kingdom, the only way in which their presence can be explained is to see them as loans from Egyptian into Chadic or vice versa. This possibility, however, is unlikely not only because desiccation of the Sahara had by this point made contact between Egyptian and Chadic speakers more difficult, but also because their forms indicate either very early phonetic exchanges or genetic relationships.143
Origins of Semitic
In 1980 I maintained that Semitic had emerged in the region where South Ethiopic Semitic is spoken today. I am less certain of that today. I now think it more likely that Semitic originated either in the Ethiopian province of Tigre or the present Eritrea or in Yemen and the Hadramawt, where many different Semitic languages have been spoken in the past and, in the east of the region, still are today.144 Thus, I now find myself more conventional and tend to agree with Edward Ullendorff, the Semitist and specialist in Ethiopian languages who wrote thirty years ago: “Whether the original home of the ancestor of these [Semitic] languages is to be sought in the Arabian peninsula or the Horn of Africa is within the realm of speculation and cannot be securely established.”145 I argue that in this region at the southern end of the Red Sea, Semitic increased the number of triconsonental roots from the relatively small number that existed in other branches of Afroasiatic. Most languages in the world have only mono- or biconsonantals. These can be enlarged by tones, or reduplication, as indeed they appear to have been in ProtoAfroasiatic.146 Another possibility is the addition of affixes: before (prefixes), after (suffixes) or inside (infixes).147 This addition seems to be the origin of triconsonentalism, which is generally restricted among world languages to North Afroasiatic and Indo-European. I believe that Semitic spread both south and north, south to its present range in Ethiopia. The great diversity of South Ethiopic Semitic languages indicates that this process must have begun long before the conventional date of the First Millennium BCE. Semitic also expanded north through what is now the Arabian desert, but which in the Tenth or Ninth



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 83
Millennia BCE was savanna. Semitic speakers then went on into the Levant where their material culture appears to have merged with the new southwest Asian agricultural societies into the pre-pottery Neolithic Natufian, which flourished between 9500–7500 BCE.148 From there herders of sheep and cattle moved to the Nile Delta and on to the Mediterranean zone of northwest Africa, the Maghreb.149 In this last stage Semitic appears to have been associated with the origins of the Berber branch of Afroasiatic, moving into the northern range of the aquatic civilization. Roger Blench’s attempt to explain why such an ancient branch should have diverged so relatively little, through Robert Dixon’s concept of equilibrium state, has been mentioned above.
Chadic and Egyptian
While Chadic speakers moved west, the ancestors of Egyptian speakers moved northwest into the savanna of the southern Sahara and became a major part of the aquatic civilization. On linguistic grounds, Takács proposes that “the proto-Egyptian tribes had a long co-existence with the ancestors of Chadic as well as of [sic] Nilo-Saharan somewhere in the Saharan macro-area.” Takács then sees the Proto-Egyptians as moving east into the Nile Valley.150 This description fits well with Camps’s archaeological conclusion that the descendents of the aquatic civilization moved into the Nile Valley with the increasing desiccation, exacerbated by overgrazing, of the Sahara in the Sixth Millennium BCE. The people were the cattle-herding Neolithic of the “Bovidians” with Ténéréan flint culture. They appear to have been the predecessors of the Badarian culture of predynastic Egypt. In any event it is clear that they represent a sharp break from the late Epipaleopithic cultures of the valley.151 Physical remains from the Badarian and early Naqadan cultures indicate that the population of Upper Egypt was at this time “broadly negroid,” which fits with portraiture from the “Bovidian” period of Saharan rock paintings.152 It is also obvious that the Badarian were the first in a series of predynastic cultures leading to the formation of pharaonic Upper Egyptian and Nubian states.153 No doubt these societies were wealthy and materially sophisticated. The intellectual sophistication of their Saharan predecessors is demonstrated by the clear astronomical purpose of stone circles and alignments at Nabta Playa; these have been dated to between 7300 and 6800 BP



84 BLACK ATHENA
(5300–4800 BCE).154 With this background, we can now theorize that the Egyptian Sothic calendar was established in 4233 BCE, during the Badarian period, 5500–3800 BCE. This was long before the unification of Egypt around 3400 BCE. This calendar was an attempt to reconcile an approximate solar calendar of 365 days with the rising of the star Sirius, which provided a good indication of the beginning of the Nile flood. Instead of altering individual dates every four years to accommodate the extra almost six hours to the 365 days, the Egyptians let the two systems run independently and become increasingly out of synchrony. They would merge every 1,460 years. Fortunately, the Roman author Censorinus reported that the two systems came together in 139 CE. Using his information, one can work back to find the previous years of synchrony:1317, 2773 and 4233 BCE. This chronology has caused Egyptologists much grief, since it has been assumed that the calendar began on or near the first political unification. During the first half of the twentieth century minimalist scholars tried to lower the date of unification to fit 2773. Most Egyptologists, however, found it impossible to accommodate such a date to the remains and the reign dates of various pharaohs.155 The only alternative was to suggest that the calendar was established in 2773, many centuries after unification. Such a solution was made impossible, however, by the discovery of an ivory tablet dated to the reign of the First Dynasty Pharaoh Djer. The tablet appears to present Sirius in its later guise as the goddess Sothis, who is depicted as a seated cow bearing between her horns a young plant symbolizing the year. This sign indicates that already by the early First Dynasty Egyptians were using the Sothic calendar.156 The one solution that has not been seriously considered is that the calendar could have been initiated in 4233 BCE. The failure provides a classic example of asking what people in a certain period could have known rather than what they did know. This principle has proved misleading from Meso-America to Megalithic northern Europe. As the Egyptologist Nicholas Grimal puts it, “the archaeological remains suggest that the civilization would not have been sufficiently developed at this period.”157 The remains at Nabta Playa point strongly to the origin of the Sothic calendar in the Badarian period. Archaeological evidence indicates that the Nile Delta or Lower Egypt in the Sixth and Fifth Millennia BCE had a very different and apparently less hierarchical society.158 Its population appears to have been coastal northern African resembling that of the Maghreb. In late Naqada the



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 85
two populations appear to have mixed. This mixing intensified—probably intentionally—after the Upper Egyptian conquest of the Delta around 3400 BCE.159 Such a pattern would fit the linguistic hypothesis that the predynastic inhabitants of the Delta spoke a triconsonantal language intermediate between Semitic and Berber, while those of Upper Egypt appear to have spoken a largely biconsonantal, and possibly tonal, language, one close to Chadic.160 Thus, the Ancient Egyptian language seems to have originated as a creole containing features of both these branches of Afroasiatic. This possibility does not deny the likelihood of other influences from Beja and Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo languages from the south. Nevertheless, the main components were the languages of Upper and Lower Egypt. It would seem likely that the linguistic merger began during the period now called Naqada II, in the early Fourth Millennium, before the political unification around 3400 BCE.161 Presumably the language developed in Abydos, the capital during this period and the two dynasties. We know from burials that many people with Lower Egyptian physical characteristics were in this region during the First Dynasty.162 The tension between the two regions persisted throughout Ancient Egyptian history. Egypt was tÅwy (Mis≥rayim in Canaanite) “the two lands.” The division was symbolized by the double crown of north and south and by ubiquitous representations of the two regions as tied together. As late as the Fifth Dynasty, pharaohs still considered themselves to be southerners ruling the north.163 The hypothesis that the Egyptian language was a merger of ChadicEgyptian with Semito-Berber has many advantages. It would explain why Semitic and Berber appear closer to each other than to Egyptian, although intense later contacts between the two make it difficult to determine the extent of the original relationship. Linguistic mixture would also explain why Egyptian, the most ancient attested Afroasiatic language, should have lost so many of the phonological and morphological features of Proto-Afroasiatic, making it less archaic than, for instance, Arabic. As is true with English, the loss of morphology made Egyptian far more reliant on syntax to convey subtleties. In a fascinating article entitled “Were There Egyptian Koines?” Joseph Greenberg linked the changes in Egyptian from the language of the Pyramid Texts to Old, Middle and Late Egyptian and that of DemoticCoptic to the geographical regions of Upper and Lower Egypt. He argued that the linguistic changes mark movement of the dominant regional



86 BLACK ATHENA
dialect. He further saw the hieroglyphs, b /b/, d /d/ and w
“ˆdn” as representing the Semitic words yd “hand” b> “to come, go, enter,” >udn “ear” rather than Egyptian words.164 Takács vehemently
denies the derivation of b from b> “to enter.” He demonstrated that
/b/ meaning “foot” is found in many Cushitic and Chadic languages.165 Similarly, >udn “ear” is found in East Chadic as well as in Semitic.166 Nevertheless, Greenberg’s argument is plausible for /d/ and “idn,” although it misses the point that the vast majority of hieroglyphs do represent Egyptian words. Greenberg goes on to claim on this basis that “a Predynastic form of Egyptian spoken in or near the Delta was replaced in the Proto-Dynastic [first two Dynasties] period by a koine based on the speech of Upper Egypt.” It in turn was replaced by northern-based Old Egyptian.167 No evidence exists of any language more archaic than that of the Pyramid Texts, the newly discovered dockets from the First Dynasty provide no exception to this statement.168 Thus, I cannot accept Greenberg’s first claim as I see no reason to doubt that before the unification of Egypt the dominant speech of the Nile Valley was based on that of the leading power, Upper Egypt. Nevertheless, /d/ and “ˆdn” may represent last traces of the merger between Semitic-Berber with Chadic-Egyptian to form the Ancient Egyptian language. The existence of a Semito-Berber component in Egyptian provides the grounds for the minority claim that it was a Semitic language.169
West Semitic
After the first unification in the Fourth Millennium BCE, Egypt, held together geographically and politically by the Nile, had only one language. By contrast, Semitic, spoken from Ethiopia to Syria and Palestine, broke up into many languages and dialects. The earliest attested of these are Akkadian, written in Mesopotamia, and Eblaite in Syria. Texts in these date back to the first half of the Third Millennium BCE. Both of these languages show evidence of interaction with non-Semitic languages. Sumerian heavily influenced Akkadian, as peoples speaking one or both of the two languages lived in close contact for more than two millennia.170 Sumerian is a language whose affinities are heatedly debated. Some regard it as an isolate, others as an Austroasiatic language related to the



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 87
Munda languages still spoken in India and Mon and Khmer in southeast Asia. Others see it as Nadene and still others as a sister language to Nostratic.171 Eblaite, too, was influenced by Sumerian and also by Hurrian, a Nadene language once spoken over northern southwest Asia and related to Chechen and Inguish, which are spoken in the northeast Caucasus today. Some scholars see Akkadian and Eblaite as making up an “East Semitic” family. Eblaite, however, is not a dialect of Akkadian. With equal plausibility others put it with Northwest Semitic.172 This is only one example of the many difficulties in classifying Semitic languages. The level of interaction between and among these languages makes conventional classification more or less arbitrary. The Ethiopian Semitic languages are divided into northern and southern clusters, more or less archaic and more or less influenced by neighboring Cushitic languages.173 The ancient and modern South Arabian languages form another group. Some scholars classify Arabic with the South Arabian but others prefer to group it with the Northwest Semitic languages.174 The Northwest Semitic group generally is described as containing Aramaic, Ugaritic and Canaanite. The Aramaic languages were originally spoken in inland Syria but in the First Millennium BCE they spread as the unofficial language of administration and trade of the Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian empires. Standard Aramaic remained important in southwest Asia under Hellenistic and Roman rule. Hurrian and its successor Urartian clearly influenced these languages. Ugaritic was the language of the north Syrian port Ugarit, which was destroyed at the end of the Bronze Age. Many texts in Akkadian were found on the site of the port but many others were discovered in the local Ugaritic language that was written with a cuneiform alphabet. Ugaritic is generally considered to be an aberrant Canaanite language, even though it did not share some of the latter’s innovations, notably the so-called “Canaanite shift” of a\>o.\175 The Canaanite languages—or rather dialects since they appear to have been mutually intelligible—are generally listed as: Hebrew, Phoenician, Moabite, Ammonite and the language spoken by the writers of the El Amarna texts, ostensibly written in “Akkadian.” Much of what distinguishes the Canaanite dialects from other Semitic languages seems to derive from Egyptian: For example, the complicated effects of tense and aspect and the so-called “wawconversive” which appears to have been derived from similar uses of the Egyptian particle iw.176



88 BLACK ATHENA
There were also many lexical loans from Egyptian into Canaanite, although very little work has been carried out on this topic. Most of those that are acknowledged concern plants, textiles and other luxuries. Others are of greater social and political importance: the Hebrew h≥åtam < h°åtam from Egyptian ht°m “to seal, complete.”177 Many scholars have derived the Hebrew ebiôn “poor” from the Egyptian Demotic abyn, Coptic ebie\n “wretched.”178 Mas “corvey” would seem to come from the Egyptian msˆ “troop or people.”179 The Ugaritic >adt and the Phoenician >dt “lady” would seem to come from the Late Egyptian idyt “young woman” and the Ugaritic >adn, Phoenician >dn, Hebrew >ådo{n “lord” from the Egyptian ˆdnw “deputy, official.” This terminology reflects the difference of power between the two regions.180 Many West Semitic words can be found in Egyptian, particularly during the New Kingdom. Tracing these words is made easier since they are written in a syllabic type of hieroglyphs specifically used to represent words and names in foreign languages. These have been treated far more fully by scholars than have Egyptian words found in West Semitic. James Hoch has produced a dictionary of Semitic Words in Egyptian Texts with 595 entries. He points out, however, that some of these words were originally Egyptian and were then taken back from Canaanite.181 It is also likely that Semitic words were incorporated into Egyptian at earlier stages but parallel forms with this origin cannot be easily distinguished from (1) genetically related forms and (2) Egyptian loans into Canaanite. All in all, although Egyptian and Canaanite belong to different branches of Afroasiatic, they have a special relationship both through the initial merger in the Fourth Millennium BCE of Upper Egyptian Chadic-Egyptian with Semito-Berber Lower Egyptian and through, sometimes intense, later contacts.
CONCLUSION
The great majority of the scholars who have considered the issue agree that Afroasiatic originated somewhere in northeastern Africa. They also agree that it is part of Nostratic and related to Euroasiatic either as a “daughter” or a “sister.” The best way to explain this ambiguity is to see Afroasiatic as the southernmost branch of Nostratic spoken in the Upper Nile or further south, after the relative depopulation of the Middle and Lower Nile Valley near the end of the last Ice Age, eleven or twelve thousand years ago. I argue that the common possession of a sex-linked



[CH. 3] AFROASIATIC, EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC 89
gender system in the Khoisan or Khoisanoid languages, Sandawe and Hadza, and Afroasiatic indicates early contacts between them. This argument and the fact that the area of greatest diversity of Afroasiatic families is closer to the Rift Valley than to the confluence of the White and Blue Niles, or the southern shores of the Red Sea strongly suggests that it was the Urheimat of Afroasiatic. From this center, branches of Afroasiatic spread out to take advantage of the new resources provided by the warmer and wetter weather of the Holocene that followed the Ice Ages. The primary division of Omotic split into its present region on the Omo River in southwestern Ethiopia. The South Cushitic branch of Afroasiatic spread into Tanzania, the East Cushitic branch to the present Somalia the Central Cushitic to northern Ethiopia. The Beja moved still further north to the Sudanese coast and the Chadic-Egyptian northwest, across the Upper Nile to the southern Sahara. Semitic appears to have been formed in northern Ethiopia or southern Arabia and from there to have moved across the Arabian savanna to the edges of Mesopotamia and then on to Syria and Palestine. Speakers of this branch migrated into the Nile Delta and on to form Berber farther west. In the Sahara agriculture initially played a lesser role than aquatic hunting and gathering did, but the balance shifted. By the Seventh Millennium BCE, the culture was primarily a herding one based on locally domesticated cattle. With the beginnings of desiccation in the Sixth Millennium BCE speakers of the Egyptian branch moved northeast towards the Nile Valley. There they formed densely populated settlements with considerable sophistication. By the middle of the Fourth Millennium these people had formed the two states of Upper Egypt and Nubia. Upper and Lower Egypt had trading and cultural contacts at least from the beginning of the Fourth Millennium. During this period the Egyptian language was apparently forming from a merger of the southern Egypto-Chadic with the northern Semito-Berber, even before the political unification that followed the conquest of the north by the south around 3400 BCE. Thus, Egyptian and West Semitic, the two Afroasiatic languages with the greatest impact on Greek, were intimately tied to each other.



T his chapter is concerned with the origins and development of
the Indo-Hittite language family and those of its subset IndoEuropean, which today is the most widely spoken in the world. The chapter also deals with the linguistic contexts in which the two families were formed and the exchanges among these and other languages. As a whole this book is about the impact of two Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian and Western Semitic, on one Indo-European one, Greek. Before being able to isolate these, it is necessary to consider exchanges between these Afroasiatic languages and Proto-Indo-Hittite (PIH) and Proto-Indo-European (PIE). The results of some of these exchanges can be seen not only in the lexicon but also in the morphology and basic structure of the whole Indo-European language family.
THE ORIGINS AND DIFFUSION OF INDOHITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN
In the first half of the nineteenth century, romantic scholars who believed in the creative powers of cold and altitude maintained that IndoEuropean originated in the Himalayas or some other Asian mountain range. As the century wore on, this Urheimat shifted west, and it was generally agreed that PIE was first spoken by nomads somewhere to the north of the Black Sea. In the last fifty years, this Urheimat has been

[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 91
generally identified with the so-called Kurgan culture (named after distinctive burial mounds) attested in this region in the Fourth and Third Millennia BCE. Possessors of this material culture appear to have spread west into Europe, southeast to Iran and India and south to the Balkans and Greece. The general scheme of expansion from Central Asia or the steppes developed before the decipherment of Hittite. The ability to read Hittite led to the discovery that it was a “primitive” Indo-European language and the further recognition of a whole Anatolian linguistic family. It is now generally agreed that Proto-Anatolian split from PIE before the latter disintegrated into its separate branches.1 It is impossible, however, to tell the length of time between the two events, which could be anywhere from five hundred years to ten thousand. In any event, the difference is sufficient to cause most general linguists to make the distinction between Indo-European and the larger grouping Indo-Hittite.2 If, as most historical linguists suppose, not merely Indo-European but also Indo-Hittite began north of the Black Sea, how and when did speakers of the Anatolian languages enter Anatolia? The terminus ante quem is provided by early Hittite names in merchants’ reports from the Assyrian commercial colony at Karum Kanesh in central Anatolia around 2000 BCE.3 Some authorities argue that the migration of Anatolian speakers into Anatolia took place early in the Third Millennium and was associated with destructions of the period known as Early Bronze Age II.4 Others prefer a later part of the Third Millennium when, Mesopotamian sources indicate, barbarians invaded Anatolia.5 These invaders would seem much more likely to have been Phrygian and Proto-Armenian speakers, that is to say Indo-Europeans in the narrow sense. The distinguished archaeologist James Mellaart has even suggested that the belt of destructions across northern Anatolia at the end of the twentieth century BCE recorded the arrival of the Hittites in central Anatolia.6 Early Hittite names attested to from before the destructions falsify this suggestion. Difficulties arise with other relatively recent scenarios from the Third Millennium. For example, linking an arrival in Anatolia with the primary split in Indo-Hittite would force the later dispersal of Indo-European languages to the late Third Millenium or even the Second. This dating would be difficult to reconcile with the association of the spread of IndoEuropean languages with that of the so-called Kurgan material culture that is attested archaeologically in the Fourth Millennium.7 If “Anatolian”



92 BLACK ATHENA
speech only arrived in Anatolia at that time, it would also be difficult to explain the great and deep divisions among these languages, some already attested in the late Third and early Second Millennia BCE. They include not only the “central” Anatolian languages—Hittite, Luvian and Palaic—but also more remote ones—such as Lydian, Lycian and possibly even Carian and the Cretan language written in Linear A.8 It is even more difficult, if not impossible, to explain the extreme internal diversity of the Anatolian subfamily if it only disintegrated in the Third or even the late Fourth Millennium.9
An Anatolian origin for Indo-Hittite
A more attractive possibility for the family’s origin is the scheme mentioned in Chapter 2; it was proposed by Colin Renfrew and, in much more linguistic detail, by the Georgian and Russian linguists Thomas Gamkrelidze and Vjac*eslav Ivanov. The scholars’ versions of the dis
persal of Indo-European (I would prefer Indo-Hittite) are very different in two crucial respects: cause and date. Renfrew associates the extension of Indo-Hittite with the spread of agriculture and, therefore, dates it to the Seventh Millennium BCE. He maintains that the language was already spoken in central Anatolia by the makers of the great Neolithic cultures there. When Renfrew proposed this the Neolithic was supposed to have begun in central Anatolia in the Seventh or Eighth Millennia BCE.10 It is now known to go back to the late Ninth.11 The region was at the western end of the southwest Asian zone of agricultural domestication. Linguistically, the culture would seem, therefore, to be a descendent of both Euroasiatic and Nostratic. PIH was only one of a number of languages spoken in central and eastern Anatolia during this long period. Likely the Kartvelian (Georgian) family, a “sister” of Euroasiatic and Hurrian as well as the apparent isolate Hattic, greatly influenced Hittite and even provides it with its name. (The Hittites called themselves Nes and their language Nesili.) By contrast, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov attribute the successful expansion of Indo-Hittite to the development of wheeled transport sometime before the beginning of the Third Millennium BCE.12 They illustrate their
contention with the argument that the reduplicated PIE word *khoekkholo “wheel, circle” has parallels in the Sumerian gigir, the Semitic gilgal/galgal, and the Georgian gorgal, all with the same meaning. They maintain that
the single root *khoel from which the reduplication was made indicates



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 93
that the original form was Indo-European.13 They then argue, on the basis of archaeology, that the greatest concentrations of carts and chariots have not been found on the steppe where conventional IndoEuropeanists site the Indo-European Urheimat but in southwest Asia. (They do not mention that the concentration is in Mesopotamia not Anatolia.14)
*Khoekkholo is only one loan from Indo-Hittite to non–Indo-Hittite languages. These loans will be discussed in some detail in the second half of this chapter. Another difference between Renfrew and Gamkrelidze and Ivanov is that while Renfrew sets the Urheimat of Indo-Hittite in the major Neolithic cluster in central Anatolia around Çatal Hüyük, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov see it as having been in eastern region of the peninsula.15 They then propose that the Anatolian (Hittite) family moved west to the center of the region.16 Armenians stayed in the homeland, while the Indo-Aryans and eastern Iranians moved east and south. The main body of IndoEuropeans, according to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, moved east and then north, swinging east of the Caspian Sea to what the authors describe as a “secondary homeland” west of the Volga and north of the Black Sea (see Map 4). They correlate this secondary homeland with the Kurgan material culture of the steppe in the Fourth and Third Millennia BCE. From this region arose what they call the “Ancient European Dialect speakers” whose dispersal led to establishment of the branches of the Celtic, Italic, Illyrian, Germanic, Baltic and Slavic families.17 The two authors do not place Greek in this cluster. They see Greek as having been linked to Armenian and Indo-Aryan, in eastern Anatolia. Armenian remained in the homeland and Indo-Aryan moved east to Iran and eventually India. Meanwhile, Greek moved through the Anatolian speakers to the west coast and from there into the whole of the Aegean Basin. They back the hypothesis that Greek originated in eastern Anatolia by providing a number of Kartvelian etymologies.18 From the Aegean, Greek speakers moved northwards to meet those of the “Ancient European Dialects” who arrived from the north. Albanian and the dead language of Thracian were formed by this merger.19 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov maintain that the great Neolithic civilizations of the Balkans in the Sixth and Fifth Millennia BCE were non–IndoEuropean speakers later “submerged by migratory waves of IndoEuropean speakers.”20 Linguistically, the clusters Gamkrelidze and Ivanov set out are plausible to most Indo-Europeanists. Specifically, most agree on the proposed

bundle of Greek, Armenian and Indo-Iranian in which, for instance, unlike other Indo-European languages, some past tenses were marked by a prefixed e-. In general, more isoglosses or similarities unite the three than occur with Greek and Italic, let alone between Greek and Slavic or Germanic.21 Even so, the historical and geographical scheme set out by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov is not necessarily the best way to explain the linguistic divisions. The authors are vague in their chronology: they merely claim that the Proto-Greeks moved through Anatolia and across the Aegean before 3000 BCE.22 This date makes it difficult to see how their speech could have retained its special relationship with Armenian and Indo-Aryan, while passing through regions in which Anatolian languages were spoken without being affected by them. Colin Renfrew has linked the diffusion of Indo-Hittite with the spread of agriculture. As mentioned in Chapter 2, Renfrew has made a number of creative modifications to the views he set out on this subject, in his 1987 book.23 On two issues, however, he has remained constant: (1) The Urheimat of Indo-Hittite was the agricultural “cradle” in central—not eastern—Anatolia. (2) Indo-Hittite, accompanied by agriculture, spread west from this Urheimat to the Aegean around 7000 BCE. According to him, Indo-Hittite speakers (now Indo-European speakers, after the split with the Anatolian branch) moved on to the Balkans to western Europe and east to the north of the Black Sea. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov and Renfrew all modify the traditional view that the Ukrainian Steppe was the Indo-European Urheimat. Nevertheless, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov call the region “the secondary homeland” and correlate it with the Kurgan culture.24 Renfrew sees the steppes merely as the base from which the Indo-Aryan speakers moved southeast to Iran and India.25 Renfrew has always emphasized what he saw as the continuity of culture in Greece since the arrival of agriculture in the Seventh Millennium. In this he was opposing his onetime fellow excavator, the Lithuanian archaeologist and polymath Marija Gimbutas. Gimbutas linked IndoEuropean expansion to that of the Kurgan culture, which, according to her, had covered the Balkans including northern Greece as well as much of central Europe.26 Renfrew has argued that Indo-European spread into western Europe with agriculture, displacing the earlier languages of the hunters and gatherers there. Other archaeologists agree that there was no agricultural revolution in Europe and that agricultural techniques and pottery came



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 95
into central and western Europe in the Sixth Millennium BCE from the east. They are divided, however, as to whether this was the result of a migration or adaptations to the new technology made by the native peoples who had previously been Mesolithic gatherers. Furthermore, non–Indo-European speakers have survived in western Europe into historic times. Basque, for instance, is still spoken today. Thus, the majority of scholars see the introduction of Indo-European languages to western Europe as coming after the spread of agriculture in a piecemeal process starting before 3000 BCE and continuing until the present.
An eclectic hypothesis
I see no reason why the hypotheses of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, Renfrew and Gimbutas cannot be reconciled or fruitfully combined. We all accept the origin of Indo-Hittite in Anatolia, against the traditional vision of an Urheimat in the steppe. Where Gamkrelidze and Ivanov see “Greek” as having moved across the Aegean, however, I agree with Renfrew that the initial move was made much earlier with the spread of agriculture. I differ from Renfrew in seeing the migrants’ language not as Proto-Greek but as a branch of Indo-Hittite. Peoples speaking forms of this language spread north to create the Neolithic civilizations of the Sixth and Fifth Millennia BCE in the Balkans. Here I differ from Gamkrelidze, Ivanov and Gimbutas. I then follow the scheme set out by W. H. Goodenough in 1970. He argued that people from these agricultural civilizations on the edge of the steppe developed techniques of nomadism. From this mixed agricultural and nomadic population that spoke Indo-Hittite the Kurgan culture formed and Indo-European, in the narrow sense, developed in the Fourth Millennium.27 At this point, I accept the conventional view that the Kurgan culture and Indo-European languages spread out from the steppe. What Gamkrelidze and Ivanov call the Ancient European Dialects (Celtic, Italic, Illyrian, Germanic, Baltic Slavic and, probably, the Tocharian families) derived from northern dialects and migrated earlier, while the Indo-Aryan (Armenian and Greek) came from the southern. It seems that Indo-Iranian speakers had penetrated Iran from the north by the end of the Third Millennium BCE. During the Second Millennium, they entered the Near East and conquered much of northern India. Already they appear to have been calling themselves Arya or Aryans.



96 BLACK ATHENA
Given the racist and anti-Semitic uses to which this name has been put, it is wonderfully ironic that the word “Aryan” has an Afroasiatic origin. It is a loan from Semitic into Indo-Iranian. In Ugaritic, the name >ary was used as a gentilic (name of a people), but the word >ary “companion” is clearly related to the Egyptian ˆrˆ with the same meaning.28 This relationship is only one of a number of linguistic indications that the Indo-Iranians were in close contact with Semitic-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia and Syria. The broad-minded Indo-Europeanist Oswald Szemerényi has argued plausibly that the reduction from the PIE fivevowel system (a,e,i,o,u) to a three-vowel system (a,i,u) in Indo-Iranian was the result of contact with speakers of Semitic with its three-vowel system.29 As Szemerényi emphasizes, such a fundamental borrowing indicates very close contacts. Proto-Greeks and Phrygians migrated through the Balkans with the Kurgan culture in the late Third or early Second Millennia BCE. The Greeks stopped short of Crete and the eastern Aegean, where IndoHittite languages survived for some centuries. The Phrygians moved on into northwestern Anatolia. The Proto-Armenians appear to have been moved by Uratian rulers from the region of Phrygia to their later homeland only in the seventh century BCE.30 This model of PIE speakers living for a time in a secondary homeland in the steppes away from Anatolian speakers and in relatively close proximity to each other explains the complex ways in which the isoglosses within Indo-European intersect.31 Specifically, it resolves such “problems” seen by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov as the Balto-Slavic-Indo isoglossess, when, according to them these languages belonged to fundamentally different branches.32 This model also ties linguistic divergence of Indo-European with archaeological evidence from the Kurgan culture. The spread of Indo-Hittite in eastern Europe was probably from Anatolia and appears to have followed the common pattern of linguistic expansion with the arrival of agriculture. On the other hand, the diffusion of Indo-European, in the narrow sense, was from the steppe north of the Black Sea and seems to have been the consequence of later conquests, migrations and cultural influences. These were possibly linked to the domestication of horses and the development of carts and, later, chariots.33 This case makes it clear that one cannot find single explanations for widespread developments. One must always be alert to the possibility that similar changes may be the results of very different processes.



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 97
Linguistic borrowings indicating an Anatolian origin for Indo-European
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov reinforce their claims for an Anatolian Urheimat by listing what they see as striking parallels between PIH and languages known to have been in or near Anatolia. Their arguments on phonetics will be considered in Chapter 5. Here we shall look at some of the lexical items they consider to be loans into conventional PIE from other languages or language families. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov find one loan from Hattic -prass- into Hittite pars+ana “leopard.” They point out the importance given to leopard cults at Çatal Hüyük, as well as elsewhere in central Anatolia.34 This etymology is far from straightforward as pars+ana has been plausibly linked to roots ÷prs, ÷prd and ÷prq in Indo-European and ÷prq in Afroasiatic, all meaning “to tear, scratch.”35 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov provide clearer examples of PIH loans into Hattic: the PIH roots ÷wer “water” and ÷ai “to give, take” appear in Hattic.36 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov also claim PIH loans into Elamite; one of these ta “to put, place, stand” fits the PIE *d[h]eH very well. They also derive the Elamite luk “fire” from PIE *l(e)ukh.37 This, however, could equally come from a (pre-)Proto-Nostratic root (if Elamite is a Dravidian language, it belongs to the larger family). Bomhard and Kerns subsume the PIH *lew-k[h] under a Proto-Nostratic root *law-/lew “shine.” They refer to Afroasiatic forms with final -h. They do not, however, mention the Egyptian rqh≥ “light, fire” (generally rendered ro|kh or rokh in Coptic).
This form indicates two possibilities: (1) that forms with a final /kh/ existed in Proto-Nostratic outside PIH and (2) that the Elamite word could be a loan from Afroasiatic. Similarly, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov provide an etymology for the Elamite pari “go on a campaign, march” from the PIH *phorH.38 This word seems ultimately related to the ProtoNostratic root *÷phir, “to bear, bring forth”; the Egyptian pri, Coptic peire “to go, come out” is even closer. 39 Other Egyptian counterparts include pri in the sense of “to mount,” prt “ritual procession” (these are also used for the rising of Sothis/Sirius) and prw “procession” or “land emerging from the inundation.” Pari/e is only one of the PIH loans into Hurrian and its later form Urartian, proposed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov. As these languages are always seen as northeast Caucasian and Nadene, there can be no shared Nostratic roots. On the other hand, if there are parallels with PIH we cannot be sure from which branch of Nostratic they came. For instance,



98 BLACK ATHENA
where Gamkrelidze and Ivanov derive the Hurrian ass- from the PIH *es
“to sit,” Bomhard and Kerns see a Proto-Nostratic root *>asy / *>esy “to put, place, be seated.” There are the Egyptian ist and the Sumerian as-te and es-de “seat, throne.”40 The Hurrian form could well be a borrowing from the latter. Similarly, where Gamkrelidze and Ivanov claim that the
Hurrian-Urartian ag- comes from the PIH *÷ak& “to lead,” the root is seen by Bomhard and Kerns as Nostratic attested in both PIH and ProtoAfroasiatic.41 Therefore, the Hurrian form could also come from Semitic. The same is true of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s major claim that the Hattic kait “grain” and the Hurrian Kad/te “barley grain” derive from the PIH *Hat> “grain.” Thus, they argue, “The presence of a common word for grain in Proto-Indo-European, Hattic and Hurrian would be consistent with the claim that agriculture and the cultivation of particular grains developed in the range of Proto-Indo-European, Hattic and Hurrian.”42 The archaeological arguments in favor of multiple domestications of grains, including barley, were discussed in the last chapter.43 Even the lexical root itself presents problems for their argument. Dolgopolsky has proposed a Nostratic root *÷cänt “kernel, grain” found in Afroasiatic and Dravidian.44 Bomhard rejects this proposal forcefully.45 Nevertheless, a Semitic, or rather a Proto-Afroasiatic root *h≥int≥ (which Gamkrelidze
and Ivanov see elsewhere as the origin of the PIE *Hand[h] “edible plant”) doubtless exists.46 However, *h≥int≥ became h≥t≤t≥ in Ugaritic and Hebrew, a change that indicates assimilation of the /n/ (a similar process also took place in many Highland East Cushitic languages).47 Such forms could have been loaned into PIH or could have developed independently within it. Given the possible Nostratic root and the even more likely possibility that the Anatolian forms were borrowed from neighboring Semitic forms, there is no reason to believe that the cultivation of grains in general, and barley in particular, began in southwest Asia rather than farther south.
LOANS FROM OTHER LANGUAGES INTO PIH
While there are problems with some of the loans Gamkrelidze and Ivanov propose to and from PIH, Hattic, Hurrian and Elamite, their argument for an Anatolian origin of PIH has other supports. They provide a number of what they believe to be Kartvelian loans into PIH. The Kartvelian, or Georgian, language family was spoken in the southwest Caucasus



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 99
and eastern Anatolia. Greenberg excluded Kartvelian from Euroasiatic, although he was willing to see it as in a larger Nostratic. He also followed the Czech linguist Václav Blaz*ek in seeing a large number of cognates between Kartvelian and Afroasiatic.48 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov provide twenty examples of Kartvelian cognates with PIH which they see as being borrowed from PIH into Kartvelian. Dolgopolsky and Bomhard, each, see one word (but different words) as deriving from Nostratic.49 The Indo-Europeanist J. P. Mallory believes that the parallels may have such a genetic origin.50 Nevertheless, some could well be loans, thus strengthening the case of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov for an Anatolian origin for PIE or, rather, PIH.51 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov also support their argument for an Anatolian Urheimat for PIH with what they see as the Egyptian origin of the PIH
*b[h]ei “bee” from bˆt. This may be so, but the greater likelihood of its being a Nostratic or even Proto-World root will be considered below. Another possible loan from Egyptian into PIE, not mentioned by
Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, is the root *÷k[h]alp for the related concepts
“to hide, steal.” Bomhard sees a Nostratic root *÷k[h]aly / *k[h]Ely for these meanings attested in Indo-European and Dravidian.52 This root as *kir also exists in Afroasiatic.53 All the Indo-European forms, however, end with a -p, forming a root *klep. This would seem cognate to the Egyptian kÅp “to cover, hide.”54 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov also propose some Sumerian loans into PIH. Two of these are connected with agriculture. The first they see is the Sumerian agar “irrigated territory, grainfield” as the etymon for the PIH *akr^o “acre, field.” This word could have come through borrowing from Sumerian of the North Semitic >ikkår “laborer, peasant, cultivate.” The Sumerian word is, however, closer to the PIH root semantically.55 The second borrowing is still more complicated. Gamkrelidze and
Ivanov see PIH *k>oou “bull, cow” as coming from the Sumerian *Nu[d] (=gud, gu) and possibly the Egyptian ngÅw “longhorned bull” sometimes shortened to ng or gw. Bomhard and Kerns identify the same root but claim it as Nostratic on the basis of the Sumerian, and a Dravidian, parallel. They do not mention the Egyptian forms.56 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov claim that the sequence of the velar nasal /n/ and a pharyngeal in Egyptian is comparable to the glottalized labiovelar in Indo-European. They associate these forms with the “Old Chinese” *<kuo and *ngie÷u÷.57 They then link these to Altaic forms and go on to claim once again that



100 BLACK ATHENA
“The agreement among various forms of linguistic evidence for terms for ‘wild bull’ and ‘domesticated bull’ pinpoints the Near East as the area of the first acquaintance with the wild and the domestic bull.”58 As shown in the last chapter, there were at least three distinct domestications of cattle, two in Asia and another in Africa.59 The Egyptian ngÅw may be the result of the merging of different words for cattle. Thus it is puzzling and interesting that these components have possible African, as well as Asian, connections. Orel and Stolbova propose an Afroasiatic root *gar “calf, bull” that would provide an equally good cognate for ngÅw as *Nu[d] (=gud, gu).60 The possibly related form gw can be placed in another Afroasiatic cluster *gaw also attested in Berber, East Chadic, and Omotic. Finally there is the initial ng. The chief Proto-Afroasiatic root for bo
vine is *Òa. The basic root in Niger-Congo is *na which may or may not
be related to Òa.61 The possibility of an extension with a final -g is suggested by the Wolof- nag “cow.”62 Wolof belongs to the Atlantic branch of Niger-Congo. In the archaic Bantu language Basa, spoken in Cameroon, the word is nyàga.63 Orel and Stolbova place the Egyptian ngÅ under a root *nag[i]H in which they also place the Arabic najat “sheep” and the West Chadic *nungi “cow.”64 They are uncertain about the West Chadic because the word could have been borrowed from nage, the equivalent word in Fulbe, the language of the Fulani and another Atlantic language.65 Takács does not list ng or ngaw among possible loans into Egyptian from non-Afroasiatic languages. Nevertheless, here too an African connection may appear. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov also propose two etymologies that suggest some Sumerian metallurgy was introduced to PIH speakers. The first is
PIH *r(e)ud[h] “red, copper, ore” from the Sumerian urudu. They claim convincingly that metal names often came from color terms. In this connection, it is interesting to note that in a bilingual vocabulary the Eblaite gloss on the Sumerian urudu was kàpálu/ kàpáru.66 This is clearly derived from the West Semitic ÷kpr, a root with many meanings. One is found in the Hebrew ko\p(p)er “henna” used for red dye.67 If ko\p(p)er “red” also meant “copper,” Kypros/Cyprus seems to be a West Semitic name for the island famous for its copper, rather than the toponym originating the metal name found in the Latin cuprum etc.68 The second etymology proposed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov is the metal name PIE *(a)wes(kh) “gold” from the Sumerian guskin “gold.” The PIE form may be shaky but their argument that names for gold, the first



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 101
metal humans worked, are often used for copper and other metals is plausible.69 These forms indicate both that the speakers of PIH did know about the soft metals and that they learned about them from Sumerians.70
Loans between PIH/PIE and Semitic
The most impressive group of loans to PIH, according to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, are those from Semitic. It is not surprising, given the origins of their discipline that most Indo-Europeanists vehemently oppose the idea of these loans.71 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s proposals include the following:
PIE *t[h]auro. “bull” from the Semitic ÷tawr. This etymology has been proposed at least since the work of August Friedrich Pott in 1836.72 Its absence from Hittite does not tie the loan to Anatolia, though contact with Semitic speakers would have been more likely there than with a PIH north of the Black Sea. The root’s absence from other branches of Afroasiatic makes the direction of the loan uncertain. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov follow conventional wisdom and argue for Semitic into IndoEuropean on the basis of root structure and the expectation that an Indo
European *th would have been rendered *th rather an interdental *t.73 This argument is not altogether convincing as what is reconstructed as a Proto-Semitic interdental *t by some scholars is seen by others as a voice
less aspirate *th.74
PIH *G[h]ait’. “kid, goat.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov point out that this form occurs in only two branches of Indo-European, Italic and Germanic. As these subfamilies are extremely ancient and located far from southwest Asia, the word points to a loan from Semitic into PIE. Dolgopolsky claims it for Nostratic and gives parallels not only from other Afroasiatic terms but also from Dravidian.75 Bomhard, however, does not list it. Orel and Stolbova do not view this as an Afroasiatic root. David Cohen, however, lists *gady “kid” as a common Semitic root and
Saul Levin sees the connection between *G[h]ait’ and the Semitic forms.76 Levin also cites the Chinese scholar Tsung-tung Chang who claims that the Archaic Chinese for goat was *kåt (the modern jie).77 Chang’s belief that it is a loan from Indo-European seems more plausible than that the parallel is a random coincidence or Proto-World. It has not, so far, been identified in any Tocharian language but if *kat, rather than *ziang (yang),



102 BLACK ATHENA
was the principle name for goat, the archaeological evidence of this early presence of goats circa 6000 BP would suggest an early expansion of
Indo-Europeans.78 All in all, it would seem that PIH *Ghait’ is probably a loan into PIH from Semitic, although it could be a shared Nostratic root for wild, not domestic, goat.
PIE *ag[ho]no. “lamb, small sheep,” Semitic *œigl “young animal.”
The Geœez form œ#gwl is even closer.79 Neither Dolgopolsky nor Bomhard
and Kerns see it as Nostratic, but *œigal “cow, calf ” is a clear Afroasiatic
root and there seems little doubt that it was loaned from Semitic to PIE not vice versa.80 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov explain the Indo-European /n/ rather than /l/ as the result of the existence of “a large IndoEuropean class of domesticated animals with *-n-.”81 I find it simpler to believe that Indo-European preserved the original sound, as in the case of the prepositions referred to in Chapter 2.82
PIE *qhe/oph. “monkey, ape.” This form is found throughout Semitic as *qop and in Egyptian as gi/wf. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have plausibly postulated that a voiceless aspirated stop in PIE could give rise to initial/k-/ or /ø/ from the Sanskrit kápi and the Greek ke\bos to the Icelandic api and the English “ape.” The two authors explain the variations as postvelar glottalized stops *q. The proposal that they derive from postvelar emphatic stops (not necessarily glottalic) is convincing, even though the alternations q/ø are not regular in the different daughter languages.83
PIH *b[h]ar. “grain, groats.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov claim that this must be a borrowing because of the rare /a/ root vocalism. There is no doubt that ÷bar/÷bur is widespread not only in Semitic, as they claim, but throughout Afroasiatic.84 Bomhard and Kerns, however, see bar/ bEr as Nostratic found also in Dravidian and Sumerian.85 This weakens, although it does not destroy, the view of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov that
*b[h]ar is a loan from Semitic into PIH.
PIE *d[h]oHna.|“grain, bread.” This root is only found in Indo
Aryan Baltic and Tocharian. The root *duh≥n “millet” appears to be limited to Semitic.86 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov find the shift Proto-Semitic /h°/ to PIH laryngeal H easier than the other way around.87



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 103
PIE *Hand[h]. “edible plant.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov see this in the Sanskrit ándha “plant from which the sacred soma was made,” the Greek ánthos “flower” and the Armenian and “field.” They derive this form from the Semitic *h≥int≥ “wheat grains.”88 The early twentieth century lexicographer of Indo-European Julius Pokorny sees a root *andh with the same word collection together with the Tocharian ant(e) “plain.” While the Armenian and Tocharian forms may well be related, I shall argue in Chapter 10 that it is much more plausible to derive the Greek ánthos “vegetable, life force” from the Egyptian ntr “vegetable, life force” than from a PIE etymon.89
PIH *k’oern. “millstone.” The parallels of this word with the Semitic root ÷gurn- have been observed at least since Hermann Möller wrote in 1911.90 It has not so far been found in any other branch of Afroasiatic. Bomhard and Kerns, who propose a Nostratic root, link *Gar-*GEr?- to Kartvelian and Dravidian as well as to the Indo-Hittite *gher, *ghor, from which come “grind” etc.91 Bomhard and Kerns disagree with Gamkrelidze and Ivanov and link “quern” not to *gurn but to another Nostratic root *k’wur-/*k’wor- “to crush, grind,” which has no Afroasiatic forms.92 Given the uncertainty on the voicing of emphatic consonants, I think that Bomhard and Kerns were too rigid here. Moreover, given the
semantic identity, there is certainly a relationship between *k’wur-/*k’worand *Gar-*GEr-. The difficulty Bomhard and Kerns have in relating the Semitic to the PIE initial consonant genetically would be eased by proposing, as Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have done, a loan from Semitic into PIH.93
PIE *Med[h]u. “honey, beverage made from honey, mead.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov propose this as a loan from the Semitic root ÷mtq. Their reasoning is that reduction of complexity is generally more common than the reverse and the root is attested only as a noun in IndoEuropean but as both a noun and a verb in Semitic. They, thus, see the loan as originating from Semitic.94 The root is, in fact, much more widely attested than merely in IndoEuropean and Semitic. Some of the clearest common roots in Nostratic are those dealing with honey. The stems *mit and *bit “bees” and their product *mel “honey” are found throughout Afroasiatic.95 The roots *mit and *bit are also found beyond Nostratic. The reconstructed Chinese



104 BLACK ATHENA
word for bee and honey is *mie÷*t.96 This could be a loan from IndoEuropean, although that is unlikely. Théophil Obenga, the Congolese specialist in African languages, has also pointed to apparent Niger-Congo parallels.97 Lionel Bender sees a root *bim, *bi or *mbe “bee, honey” in Proto-Nilo-Saharan.98 Similar forms even exist in Polynesian.99 Thus, there is a possibility that the roots of these forms may be Proto-World. Certainly, hunters and gatherers enjoy honey.
PIH *P[h]elek[h]u-. “ax, poleax.” Since the decipherment of cuneiform in the mid-nineteenth century, scholars have been struck by the resemblance between the Greek pélekus found in Homer and the Akkadian pilaqqu both meaning “ax.”100 They also knew that pélekus, although with an unusual form for Indo-European, had a regularly derived cognate in the Sanskrit parasú. In addition, they realized that the Semitic roots ÷plq and ÷plg, with meanings of “cleave” and “cleaver” were widespread.101 Therefore, they found it impossible to link pilaqqu with pélekus . Gamkrildze and Ivanov’s solution to the riddle is to propose, convincingly, that the loan was made from Semitic when the Greek and Indo-Aryan branches of Indo-European were still united. The process must have taken place early before Indo-Aryan went through the satem
shift from palatal k[h]y > s.102
PIE *****Sek[h]ur|-. “ax, poleax.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov see a loan from a Semitic root attested in the Akkadian sukurru “javelin” and the Hebrew segor “ax” to the Latin secu@ris and the Old Church Slavonic sekyra “ax.” The fact that these two languages are in what the authors describe as Ancient European Dialects convinces them that the form is an early loan.103 There are, however, some difficulties with this scheme. First, the word ságaris (5) “ax” is found in Greek and like almost all words in Greek with initial s-, is clearly a loan word. Since it is associated with Scythes and Persians, the word is supposed to come from one of these languages, but no trace of it has been found in Indo-Aryan. Ságaris is also widely thought to be the origin of the Hebrew sEgor, “battle ax.”104 The Semitic root ÷sgr is “to shut, close, imprison.” The word sEgôr means “to enclose, encase.” The Latin se\cu\rus is generally thought to derive from the IndoEuropean root *sek “cut” and could be a development of the IndoEuropean root *sek “cut” and cu\ra “cut off from care.” This charming



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 105
and ancient explanation is clearly a folk etymology. A loan from the Canaanite (probably Punic) sEgôr or the passive participle of ÷sgr, sågur/ såkur is much more likely. The alternation sgr/skr is found in both Hebrew and Phoenician.
PIE K[h]laHw. “lock, close: key.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov derive this from a Semitic root *k-l “to hold back, restrain, lock.” Bomhard and
Kerns, however, postulate *khal-*khEl “to guard, hold back, watch” as a Nostratic root, even though the only form they can find outside IndoEuropean and Semitic is the Sumerian kal “hold, keep, retain.”105 This could easily be derived from the Akkadian kalû.
PIE *****naHw-. “ship, vessel.” In this case Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have been ingenious or far-fetched. They derive *naHw- from the Semitic root *>unw(at) “vessel.” The derivation requires a metathesis of the initial >u- and the laryngeal lengthens the root vowel. Bomhard and Kern give a Nostratic etymology for what they describe as the PIE *ne?H- (glottal fricative) *no?H “sail, ship.” They emphasize the process and link it to the Afroasiatic *ne?-/*nE? “to come, go, arrive, travel, sail” in particular the Egyptian nŒˆ Coptic na “to travel by boat.”106 There is also the similar form nyw “pot, vessel,” which may be related.107 Either a common Nostratic root or a borrowing into PIE from Egyptian would seem more plausible than Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s Semitic derivation.
PIE *****k[ho]r(e)i. “buy, trade, barter.” Early in the twentieth century, Herman Möller proposed deriving this root from the Semitic *kri.108 It fits well in both its phonetics and its semantics.
PIE *t’ap[h]. “sacrifice.” This root is found widely both in IndoEuropean, from Latin to Tocharian, and in Semitic. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s proposal here is plausible, although it may at times have been
confused with a Nostratic root *t[h]ap[h] “fire, burn.”109
PIE *Hast[h]er-. “star” and the Semitic *œttar “deified star, planet Venus.” While these forms are clearly related, the nature of that relationship is not at all obvious. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov contradict themselves here. They first argue that the loan was from Semitic to



106 BLACK ATHENA
Indo-European as the initial œayin in Semitic corresponds to the IndoHittite, laryngeal H. They further add that, very much as in Semitic languages, in Indo-European an interdental spirant /t/ produced an /s/ or ø in different branches.110 In a footnote, however, the authors argue for a loan from Indo-Hittite into Semitic on the grounds that the
elements in *Hast[h]er can be explained within Indo-Hittite while those
in *œttar cannot.111 On the other hand, John Pairman Brown argues that
*œttar was derived from the Sumero-Akkadian name of the goddess Is ̈tar. He then suggests that this form itself may be “a very old loan from the Indo-European for “star.”112 Whichever the direction, the relationship between the two roots indicates close contacts between early Indo-Hittite and Semitic speakers.
PIE *Sep[h]t[h]m.¢ “seven.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, following a
tradition going back to Möller and beyond, derive from the Semitic *sabœ
feminine *sabœ -at.113 They argue that “borrowing of numerals especially those higher than five is a widespread phenomenon attested in many languages and can be explained by particularly close contact and cultural interaction.” They also see Proto-Kartvelian as having borrowed the Semitic feminine form to form *swid.114 Gamkrelidze and Ivanov do not take up Möller’s parallel etymology from Semitic: that of the Indo-European root he refers to as *s-g:- “six.”115 Pokorny describes the root uncertainly as *sue÷ks|, *sek^s, *kseks|, *ksue÷ks|, ue÷ks|or uk^s.116 The Sanskrit form is xát but the Avestan is xsvas. The initial cluster xsv is unparalleled in Indo-European. This suggests a loan but from what Semitic form? The situation is further complicated by the medial -d- found for “six” in the masculine in Ge’ez and other Ethiopic languages. Akkadian and Hebrew have forms based on s--s/t. The conventional explanation is that the Semitic root is *sds, but this was dropped in the southwest Asian languages.117 Saul Levin uses Egyptian forms sis or srsw to postulate that the Afroasiatic root was *SeCS (S standing for a sibilant or related fricative and CS for an unspecified consonant). He goes on to argue that the medial -d- was inserted to avoid the confusing sibilants. He also insists on the importance of the linked numbers six and seven in Mesopotamian and western Semitic culture. There were for instance, the seven visible planets, leading to the days of the week, the seven days of creation and resting after the sixth day, not to mention the sexagesimal system.118



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 107
PIE K[h]r-¢n. and the Semitic *qarn “horn.” Finally, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov take up this example. The Indo-Europeanist Alan Nussbaum devotes his book Head and Horn in Indo-European to this term.119 It is a significant indicator of Nussbaum’s cultural blinkers, as well as those of his teachers, colleagues and referees, that in this study of the Indo
European root *kher “head” and *khr-¢n- “horn” he does not mention, let alone discuss, the fact that the Semitic root for “horn” is *qarn. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov maintain that the loan is from PIE to Semitic not the other way around.120 They argue for this direction because
**k[h]r≥-n derives from a root *k[[h] r “top, head,” lacking in Afroasiatic. Saul Levin, too, argues that *qarn is a loan from Indo-European into Semitic on the grounds that it is unattested elsewhere in Afroasiatic.121 Egyptian, however, has the words qÅ “be high” qÅÅ “hill,” which have cognates in Berber, Semitic, and Lowland East Cushitic.122 Orel and Stolbova see parallels to the Semitic *qarn in the Late Egyptian qrty “two horns” and the Omotic qar “horn.”123 Whatever, the direction of borrowing, the striking similarity of the two roots indicates close contacts between Semitic and PIE speakers.
Hittite Í all-i-. “royal” Akkadian ßarr-um “king.” That this crucial term should have been borrowed from Akkadian is important but not surprising, given the contacts known to have taken place between Akkadian-speaking Assyrian merchants and Hittite speakers around 2000 BCE. Probably these contacts occurred much earlier.124 To conclude this section, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have produced or repeated a number of significant lexical exchanges between PIH-PIE and many southwest Asian languages. Some of the etymologies seem unlikely; others are as well or better explained by derivations from common roots in Nostratic rather than from loans. Nevertheless, a substantial core remains, especially of loans from Semitic. Unless a loan is attested in both Anatolian and PIE, however, it cannot be used as evidence that Anatolia was the Indo-Hittite Urheimat. Sufficient other evidence in favor of this Urheimat exists elsewhere. In fact, very few of Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s proposals can jump this double hurdle. Nevertheless, the lexical exchanges and the evidence of morphological and structural loans from Semitic into PIE, which I hope to show below, indicate very close relationships between Semitic and PIE speakers, particularly just before the breakup of PIE in the Fourth Millennium BCE.



108 BLACK ATHENA
Beyond words: Further borrowings between Afroasiatic and Indo-Hittite
Any aspect of one language can be transferred to another. Generally, however, there is a hierarchy in borrowing: The easiest to borrow are content words, chiefly nouns. Then comes the transfer of functional words, conjunctions and adverbial particles. With more intense contact one can find prepositions and postpositions; this involves some structural changes. Beyond that with strong cultural pressure more or less significant structural modification can occur.125 When looking at relations between Afroasiatic and PIH, the observer may find it difficult to distinguish these more fundamental exchanges from shared derivations from Nostratic. For instance, while the negation /n/ is common throughout Nostratic, the prepositions *en “in,” *an “on,” and *ad “to” (referred to in Chapter 2) are only attested in PIE and Afroasiatic.126 Thus, they could either be forms common to Nostratic that have dropped out of other branches or they could be loans, probably from Semitic to PIE. A morphological feature with a similar ambiguity is the ending /-i¤/ used in Indo-European with both active and inactive nouns with the general sense “of pertaining to” and used later for the genitive or locative. This appears in other Euroasiatic languages, such as Ainu, Aleut, Inuit and, possibly, Chukchi and Korean.127 The parallels with IndoEuropean Afroasiatic, however, are even more striking. The so-called nisba form /-i¤/ “belonging to” or “the one who” is found in both Egyptian and Semitic: see such contemporary forms as Iraqi, Baghdadi, Jordani, Israeli. In Proto-Semitic, too, the nisba is associated with the genitive ending found in Eblaite, Akkadian and Arabic and is the same as that in PIE, -ı\:.128 Thus, these correspondences, like those of the prepositions, indicate either a Nostratic root or an Afroasiatic loan into PIE or both.
DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDO-EUROPEAN GENDER SYSTEM BASED ON SEX
The “borrowing” of an organizational system as fundamental as gender requires not only close contact between speakers of the two languages but also existing exchanges of vocabulary and other grammatical features. In Chapter 3, I considered the possibility that the Afroasiatic binary sexual gender system was derived from Khoisan. In that case dealing with the very distant past and since we have little knowledge of East



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 109
African Khoisan, it is only possible to find a few lexical borrowings. In the case of Afroasiatic, or specifically Semitic and PIE, as suggested above, we have more evidence. According to the conventional definition, “genders are classes of nouns reflected in the behavior of associated words.”129 By this definition, gender is extremely common among the world’s languages. Here, however, I am concerned with the limited subsets of binary systems reflecting the oppositions animate-inanimate and masculine-feminine, which are considerably less frequent. Although a sex-gender system is found in every branch of IndoEuropean (in the narrow sense), the system provides two interesting problems.130 First, Indo-European is the only Euroasiatic language in which sex-based gender occurs and, second, linguists generally agree that the system is not primary to Indo-European. Like some other languages, PIH had a predisposition for binary structures. In this case, the major one was between “active” and “inactive” nouns. There were also verb doublets to match these categories.131 The inactive nouns were marked with “-om” and the active with nothing or, later, with a final -s or -os. Plurals of active nouns were formed with an additional -s. The inactive nouns were not considered to have plurals; therefore, they required verbs in the singular. Sometimes, however, they were considered to have mass, which was marked with *-a.|132
This much is generally agreed. How these endings became attached to the feminine gender is, however, hotly disputed. In 1906 the NeoGrammarian Karl Brugmann argued that after some semantic shifts “had caused no more than two or three /a/|abstracts or collectives and i|/ya
or i|/i|i|stems or forms to refer to females, the analogical attraction of this handful of forms was sufficient to draw the bulk of words denoting females into what came to be the distinctive feminine classes.”133 Brugmann
implied that the common Indo-European word *gue÷na (|*k’wena)|“woman”
was originally an abstract word for “bearing, parturition.” Thus, it had the abstract plural suffix -a.|134 On equally flimsy grounds, he suggested
that the PIE *ekua÷ (*ekhoa)|“can have meant originally a drove of horses”
[my italics]. These two examples provided his grounds for the semantic shift that led to the establishment of a feminine gender with the final -a.|135 Brugmann’s hypothesis was greatly strengthened by the decipher
ment of Hittite. In the first place, no obvious gender system was found in the language and, second, vowel lengthenings were explained by actual



110 BLACK ATHENA
laryngeals in Hittite that had disappeared in Indo-European. Therefore, conventional Indo-Europeanists have always celebrated Brugmann’s discovery.136 Paul Brosman, the linguist whose work on this topic Gamkrelidze and Ivanov follow, accepts Brugmann’s general hypothesis but no longer maintains that the final -a|in *k’wena|derived from an abstract plural.
Instead he sees the coding simply as a coincidence that helped the shift.137 In the years that followed Brugmann’s work, a number of linguists dismissed his proposal as implausible.138 The only alternative was provided by the French Indo-Europeanists Antoine Meillet and André Martinet who saw the distinction between male and female as having begun with the demonstratives *so and *sa.|139 Others came up with still less
likely explanations. For instance, the German historical linguist Götz Weinold proposed that the three-way distinctions of masculine-feminineneuter was a natural development corresponding to what he saw as the triadic structure of Indo-European society as a whole, so beloved by Dumézil and other Aryanist mystics.140 In 1975 the American linguist Rocky Miranda revived Brugmann’s original hypothesis by providing what he saw as a parallel example of one word having created a whole new gender. According to Miranda, the Indo-Aryan language of Konkani, spoken around Goa on the west coast of India, went through a major structural change when the word c ̈edu “child,” but primarily “little girl,” was reclassified from neuter to a new form of feminine. This change affected the whole system and “the neuter gender became a second feminine gender.”141 This gender bending is not as drastic a change as the Indo-European transformation from a two gender system of active-inactive to a triadic masculine-feminineneuter. Nevertheless, it does illustrate the possible attractive power of a single central word. Paul Brosman uses Miranda’s work to buttress his modified restatement of Brugmann’s views.142 Others remain skeptical. Szemerényi, for instance, argues convincingly that the long vowels in PIE should not be derived from lost laryngeals unless the latter are attested in Hittite, which they are not in the collective or neuter plural forms.143 He also questions the general assumption that Hittite lacked a feminine gender.144 Specifically, he argues that
the PIE root on which Brugmann based his hypothesis—*k’wena|—was
originally *gwen (*k’wen) and that the final -a was already a feminine suffix.145



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 111
A Semitic origin for Indo-Hittite gender
In all the convoluted arguments regarding gender no Indo-Europeanist has, to my knowledge, looked beyond the Indo-European family. Given what we know about lexical exchange and the possibility of grammatical influences, it would seem worthwhile to consider the likelihood of an Afroasiatic explanation for the rise of the Indo-European feminine gender. As stated in the last chapter, almost every branch of Afroasiatic is organized on the basis of a strict distinction between male and female gender. Given the contacts between speakers of North Afroasiatic and those of Indo-Hittite—which are indicated by archaeology, lexical borrowings and mere geographical proximity—some Indo-Hittite speakers undoubtedly know about the principle of sex-based gender. In 1959, Istvan Fodor made the important point that an organizational principle of sex gender is not the same as the suffixes marking gender that appear in many genderless languages.146 In this case, however, the two coincide and the similarity of the phonetic markers in Afroasiatic and Indo-European reinforces the idea that the central structural principle was borrowed. The feminine marker *-t (not found in Khoisan) appears in Semitic, Egyptian, Cushitic, Chadic, Berber and, in some instances, Omotic.147 The vocalization of the suffix is less secure but in Semitic and Egyptian, the two language families for which there is ancient attestation and with which PIE speakers are likely to have contact, the predominant form is *-at in the singular and *-at|in the plural.148 The Egyptologist and linguist
Antonio Loprieno views the overall situation of feminine markers in Egyptian in the singular as -at after consonantal and A-stems, as -ut|after
U-stems and -it|after I-stems.149 In Akkadian in the normal state, the suffix was -at-(um) or -t-(um) and in the plural it was always -at|. In the
absolute state, it was -at in the singular and -a i|n the plural.150
As mentioned above, since the nineteenth century linguists have associated development of the feminine -a|or -ıi|n Indo-European with the
neuter plural or abstract -a. It is just possible that this neuter plural was also borrowed from Semitic. In Akkadian, abstracts were formed with the suffix -ut|.151 According to Loprieno, the similar Egyptian suffix -wt
was “morphologically feminine but applied to masculine nouns is often used in the formation of collectives.”152 The Egyptologist Jean Vergote saw the Middle Egyptian -wt as having two different meanings, which he



112 BLACK ATHENA
reconstructed from Coptic: the first *-uw|at included “true collective
nouns”; the second *-aw|at “is generally considered a category of ab
stract nouns.”153 It is not clear whether these reconstructions of the Egyptian -wt can be applied to the Akkadian –ut|. Nevertheless, the inaccuracy
of early cuneiform makes such an idea quite possible. In Sumerian, for which the script appears to have been designed, /w/ was rare and probably secondary. Therefore, in the Third Millennium it was used to signify wa, we, wi and wu.154 If this is the case, *-aw|at and *-uw|at would seem
sufficient not only to explain the Hittite collective –a|but also to provide
a reason for its connection with the PIE feminine -a|.
There is no trace of a final *-t in PIH or PIE. The phonetic obstacle here to a borrowing from a Semitic suffix -at is not, however, so great as one might suppose. In both Semitic and Egyptian, the -t in the final position was clearly very unstable. When it was exposed, as when case or unstressed verbal endings were lost, the -t too was dropped, lengthening the previous vowel in compensation. This process took place for different forms in different languages at different times. In Egyptian -t was dropped during Late Egyptian 1600-1000 BCE.155 In the Canaanite dialects the development -at>-ah| was, if anything, rather later.156 Such
changes would, of course, have been too late to have affected PIE, let alone PIH. This was not the case, however, with Eblaite, which is attested from the middle of the Third Millennium.157 In this language, written in north Syria and, therefore, close to any Urheimat of Indo-Hittite or IndoEuropean, -t was frequently dropped, not only when exposed as a final, but also while case endings remained.158 If this construction was expressed in writing, the process had probably been going on for a long time previously in speech. Then -at and -at|- were replaced by “-a” or “-a-”—the
length of the vowel could not be expressed in Eblaite cuneiform. However, /a/| is very likely the sound, not only through analogy with the
normal compensation but also because in Amorite, spoken in north Syria around 2000 BCE, “-at in the absolute state was replaced by “-a.|”159
Given the structural similarities of the gender system in Semitic and PIE, as well as those between the markers for the feminine and collective, the probability of a borrowing at some level is very high. Its time, place and nature, however, is much less certain. Before investigating these factors, we should consider the question of what kind of gender existed in the Anatolian languages. As mentioned above, the scholarly consensus is that there is no trace of gender in Hittite. Moreover, the active



[CH. 4] ORIGINS OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN 113
inactive gender system common in Euroasiatic was still strong in that language. Some have argued that the existence of suppletive indicators of sex (using different stems for pairs of the type: ram-ewe, pig-sow or boy-girl) demonstrates that a sex-gender system did not exist. Fodor has denied this line of thinking, pointing out that such lexically distinct forms have existed throughout Indo-European with its strong gender system.160 As mentioned above, most agree that the -a f|or collectives did exist in
Hittite.161 Furthermore, a minority of scholars insist that there was a three-way gender system in PIH before the separation of PIE from Anatolian, but as Szemerényi stated in 1985, “the question is still not settled.”162 Nevertheless, the probability is that a three-way system did not exist in the Anatolian languages. The minimal hypothesis of borrowing from Semitic is the purely structural one that speakers of PIE were aware of a language organized by sex-gender and, therefore, they used their own collective -a|for the new
gender. Not far removed from this reasoning, is holding that PIE speakers in the late Fourth Millennium were reinforced in their choice of a marker for the new gender by the knowledge that at least one of the closest Semitic languages indicated the feminine with an -a.|
The hypothesis that the PIH collective -a|itself derived from an
Afroasiatic *-aw|at, although attractive, is obviously much more specula
tive.163 In the first place, if one places the breakup of Indo-Hittite in the Fifth Millennium, the introduction of such a collective before that date would require a relatively nearby Afroasiatic language in which the final -t had been lost. One certainly could not project Eblaite that far into the past, although as shown above later evidence indicates the vulnerability of final -t throughout Afroasiatic. It is also strongly probable that at that time Semitic speakers were already ensconced in north Syria.164 Another serious problem is the improbability that a collective would have been introduced into Anatolian before or without the feminine singular. There are in fact some slight indications that the Hittites were using -a as a female marker. If Szemerényi is right, the PIH root was
*÷gwen (*k’wen) and the final -a,|found in the Hittite koinna, was probably
already a feminine suffix in Anatolian.165 The use of this marker, however, does not mean that any of the Anatolian languages had set up a sexgender system. It is also possible that *k’wen itself was borrowed from Semitic. Orel and Stolbova postulate an Afroasiatic root *kün “woman, co-wife.” The



114 BLACK ATHENA
Akkadian kinıt\:u and Arabic kann-at are found elsewhere, in Berber and West Chadic. Orel and Stolbova see the development in the Agaw *kwin“woman” as irregular. Even so, it is possible that the Afroasiatic root, like the Indo-European one, was originally a labiovelar.166 No doubt fewer traces of sex-gender can be found in the Anatolian languages than in other branches of Indo-Hittite. This may be because the Semitic influence developed further within Indo-European. Alternatively, gender in the Anatolian languages could have been limited or counteracted by the surrounding and underlying languages that lacked a sex-gender system: Hattic, Kartvelian, Hurrian, Sumerian, Elamite etc. It is, in fact, easy to see how Semitic languages could have influenced the Anatolian in the Fourth Millennium. Urban life began at Ebla in the middle of the Fourth Millennium as part of the trading system made up of so-called Uruk, Sumero-Semitic speakers, and connecting Mesopotamia to Iran, Syria and central Anatolia. This is 1,500 years before Assyrian merchants were recorded in Hittite-speaking Karum Kanesh.167 As far as I am aware, little archaeological evidence of contact between southwest Asia and the steppe has been found from before the disintegration of PIE in the Fourth Millennium. Nevertheless, using the grounds of vocabulary, some have argued that there was trading around the Black Sea at this time.168 If the archaeological evidence is thinly stretched, the linguistic evidence of exchange between Semitic and PIE is strong. The lexical borrowings are supplemented by the grammatical borrowings mentioned above. In this context, there would seem no reason to deny that the concept of a feminine gender came to PIE from Semitic and little reason to deny that the gender’s marker -a|had the same origin. As stated above,
the derivation of the Indo-Hittite collective plural -a f|rom an Afroasiatic
*-uw|at or *-aw|at is much less clear-cut.
That Indo-Hittite or Indo-European speakers borrowed the feminine gender does not mean the rigid Afroasiatic binary sex-gender system was reproduced. The earlier “active” gender of Indo-Hittite was split between masculine and feminine but the “inactive” one remained as neuter, with the original marker *-om preserved in the singular. The borrowed collective *-a|being used for the plural, but, as a collective, it took
verbs in the singular. In this way Indo-European developed its unique three-way gender system.

CONCLUSION
The failure of Indo-Europeanists and other historical linguists even to consider the possibility of some relationship between the strikingly obvious similarities shared by the Indo-European and Afroasiatic gender systems is an example of the general academic tendency to avoid the obvious. In this particular case it is an indication that the men and women formed in the linguistic tradition of the Neo-Grammarians are still reluctant, or unable, to “think outside the box.” The limiting effects of this tradition must also be taken into account when considering Indo-Europeanists’ approaches to the possibilities of exchanges between individual languages belonging to the Afroasiatic and Indo-Hittite. This chapter has been concerned the origins of Indo-Hittite and IndoEuropean and their contacts with Afroasiatic languages before the Third Millennium BCE. In the rest of the book I shall look at the linguistic relations between one Indo-European language, Greek, and two Afroasiatic, West Semitic and Ancient Egyptian, in the following three millennia.

T
he next three chapters are concerned with supposed and actual influences of Egyptian and West Semitic on the development of Greek. As will be seen below, this inquiry gives very different results at the different levels of the Greek language. Greek phonology shows only a few signs of any Afroasiatic impact. Some morphological influences, treated in Chapter 6, can be seen and these explain a number of problems that have puzzled Indo-Europeanists. The introduction into Greek of certain Afroasiatic particles and conjuctions has significantly affected syntax. This aspect, considered in Chapter 7, is, however, linked to the great number of lexical borrowings from Egyptian and Semitic into Greek and these will be treated in the rest of the volume.
GREEK: RESULT OF A LINGUISTIC SHIFT OR OF LANGUAGE CONTACT?
A hierarchy of linguistic aspects like that described is to be expected in a “contact” language. Now I should like to consider the relationship of Egyptian and West Semitic to Greek in the context of modern theories of language contact. Historians of Greek have worked out the phonetic relationships among Greek dialects in exquisite detail. Apart from showing the descent from Proto-Indo-European (PIE), however, they are much more vague when they consider the origins of the Greek language as a

[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 117
whole.1 One reason for this vagueness is simply the lack of evidence. Nevertheless, the failure to apply modern approaches to the problem has a long tradition that I see as having an ideological basis. Wilhelm von Humboldt’s conviction that Indo-European languages were qualitatively different from, and superior to, all others was mentioned in Chapter 1.2 Furthermore, in his outline of the new discipline, later known as Altertumswissenschaft or “classics,” he declared that the excellence of Greek lay in its being uncontaminated by foreign elements.3 Elsewhere, he maintained that Greek history and culture as a whole were categorically above that of all others and that “from the Greeks we take something more than earthly—almost godlike.”4 Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we can no longer set Greek apart as a special case. We should treat it like any other language and compare it with other mixed languages. A good way to do this is to examine Greek within the framework proposed in Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics by Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman. This work has been widely accepted as the best survey of the subject so far.5 Thomason wrote the first section of the book, which deals with language contact in general, and in this she found it useful to set up a scale of languages that appear to be mixed. It treats cases in which increasing degrees of contact have occurred. The culmination of this process is a linguistic shift in which a population gives up its language and takes on another.6 The distinction between contact and shift comes essentially from the perspective of the observer. What had been seen as the exotic language that influenced the native one, now itself becomes the focus of attention and is seen as having been influenced by the language it replaced. Typically, the context for such changes is the imposition of a colonizing language upon a politically or socially subordinate, but numerically larger, population. Let me illustrate this schematically: Generation 1. Monolingual speakers of the native language X and Y-speaking newcomers interact. Each may possibly have a passive knowledge of the other language. Generation 2. At least one group becomes bilingual. The X people speak their own language natively and Y with an X accent (and structure) and the Ys speak Y natively and possibly X with a Y accent (and structure). Generation 3. Everyone speaks Y and X is dead. Two discernible accents, X and Y, still exist.



118 BLACK ATHENA
Generation 4. Y speakers with an X accent become dominant (possibly because of greater numbers), and this pronunciation becomes standard among the whole population.7 Thus, looked at retrospectively, language mixing from contact differs in the aspects of language affected from languages resulting from a shift. In most cases, the changes brought about through contact begin with vocabulary: First, nouns then verbs and modifiers alter and then the shift goes on to particles, prepositions and postpositions. After that, syntax and morphology and, finally, phonology are transformed. In languages where a shift has largely taken place, the old intonation, phonology and syntax tend to be retained long after the new vocabulary has been accepted. Examples of this can be seen in the Orkney and Shetland islands where, during the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Aberdonian Scots replaced the old dialect, Norn. A few Norse words survive but the major difference between the dialects of the islands and those of the Scottish mainland is now in the former’s strikingly Scandinavian intonation. By contrast, during the same period, while Sweden ruled Finland some Finnish speakers adopted every aspect of Swedish, except for the flat intonation of their original language. This flat pattern was adopted by the Swedish settlers themselves. Similarly, Irish English has absorbed remarkably few Irish words but still has a heavily Irish intonation and phonetic structure and some Irish syntax, as shown in the line from the song: “if its thinking in your inner heart.”8 Language contact, in Thomason’s sense that the native linguistic structures have been maintained while much or most of the vocabulary has been imported, is extremely common. It can be seen in many languages.9 Two particularly striking examples of this pattern are found in Old Javanese, or Kawi, and Coptic. Kawi was the language to which Humboldt devoted the last years of his life. It was, as he rightly perceived, a Malay language with a massive infusion of Sanskrit and Pali vocabulary.10 Similarly, Coptic phonology, morphology, syntax and basic vocabulary are fundamentally native Egyptian but a high proportion of the nouns and verbs, as well as many particles, come from Greek.11 If we lacked a knowledge of Egyptian history of the relevant period, we could still infer that a minority of Greek speakers had dominated a larger Egyptian-speaking population for some centuries. It would be extremely implausible to use the linguistic evidence to propose that Egyptian speakers had dominated Greeks, but this kind of assertion is precisely what



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 119
supporters of the Aryan model ask us to do when looking at the very similar pattern of mixing found in Greek. No one doubts that Greek contains linguistic mixture. The question is whether the mixture is the result of shift or contact. According to the Aryan Model, Greek is the result of a linguistic shift after Hellenes who spoke Indo-European conquered pre-Hellenes who did not speak IndoEuropean. The classicist J. Haley and archaeologist Carl Blegen argued in a well-known article published in 1927 that the distribution of placenames with the non–Indo-European elements -nthos and -ssos/-ttos. corresponded with Early Bronze Age settlements (i.e. before the supposed conquest) and, hence, indicated pre-Hellenic settlements.12 Archaeologically, the theory is very flimsy, as the correspondences would hold as well for Late Bronze Age as for Early Bronze Age sites. More importantly, the toponymic aspect is equally feeble as the hypothesis was abandoned by its creator Paul Kretschmer in 1924, when he pointed out that -nthos is found attached to Indo-European stems.13 Thus, while it is possible to hypothesize that these survived from earlier—preHellenic—waves of Indo-European speakers, they cannot in themselves indicate a Pre-Indo-European language stratum. In their 1927 article, Blegen and Haley also argued that the distribution of place names ending in -issos or -nthos corresponded with Early Bronze Age sites and thus the suffixes were indicators of a “preHellenic” language.14 I attacked the Haley-Blegen hypothesis in Volume 1.15 Many of us make mistakes, and one, of which I am deeply ashamed, is my failure to recognize in Black Athena Writes Back, that Jasanoff and Nussbaum had stated plainly that their belief in a pre-Hellenic language or languages was “utterly independent of the Haley-Blegen theory or any other particular reconstruction of Aegean Prehistory.”16 Such opting out provides a convenient if not unassailable position. Jasanoff and Nussbaum fail to give any evidence for these languages, apart from the Greek vocabulary that cannot be explained in terms of Indo-European. While I disagree with them that this “unknown” vocabulary offers evidence of a substrate of non–Indo-Hittite words, I happily concede that there may be traces of an Indo-Hittite influence on the Indo-European basis of Greek, including the toponymic suffix -ssos, (although not -nthos).17 Nevertheless, such influences are trivial compared to the massive impact upon Greek of the Afroasiatic languages through contact. For an analogy, let us look at the situation in northern India, where



120 BLACK ATHENA
Indo-European speakers appear to have overwhelmed an indigenous population that did not speak an Indo-European language. Sanskrit and the other ancient Indic languages indicate that in a shift the native speakers accepted most of the Indo-European morphology and nearly all of its vocabulary. The original people, however, retained their phonology to such an extent, that the invaders themselves adopted it. By contrast, the Dravidian languages, surviving in southern India, indicate contact but no shift. These languages accepted large numbers of Indic words and some morpho-syntactical patterns but retained their basic grammatical structure and pronunciation.18 The Indo-European aspects of Greek are the opposite of those found in Sanskrit: Greek has an Indo-European phonology and a large non–Indo-European vocabulary, while Sanskrit has a non–Indo-European phonology and an overwhelmingly IndoEuropean vocabulary. In fact, taking Indo-European as the base, the pattern found in Greek shows a striking resemblance to that of the Dravidian languages. Thus, by analogy the Greek mixture should probably be seen as the result of contact not of a shift. In a few situations a bilingual minority has retained its basic vocabulary in order to maintain its identity, while giving up most of its phonology and syntax. Teleologically, such a language can be described as “dying,” but the process can last many centuries.19 Examples can be found in English Romany, and the Modern Greek spoken in Turkey, before the expulsions from Asia Minor of 1921-2, where, as an author put it in 1916, “the body has remained Greek, but the soul has become Turkish.”20 Could this have been the case in Ancient Greece with the preHellenes as equivalents of the English Rom [Gypsies], abandoning nearly all aspects of their language except for their vocabulary? I argue that the answer is no. In such situations, the minority or socially subordinate population retains the words of everyday life, which is not the case for the hypothetical speakers of pre-Hellenic. The etymological lexicographer of Greek, Pierre Chantraine, pointed out that the fundamental elements of the Greek vocabulary: those forms concerned with family and domestic animals, simple adjectives and basic verbs largely derived from Indo-European.21 Greek shows a stark contrast between the less than 40 percent of the total vocabulary as Indo-European, described by the Indo-Europeanist Anna Morpurgo-Davies, and the 79 percent of Indo-European words found in the Swadesh 100-word list.22 In the three cases on the Swadesh list where there are Indo-European



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 121
and apparently non–Indo-European synonyms, the Indo-European word is thought to be older.23 All in all, the linguistic shift suggested by the Aryan Model is extremely unlikely because it would require the pre-Hellenic population to have given up its phonology, morphology and everyday vocabulary for those of its Indo-European–speaking conquerors, while retaining much of its sophisticated lexicon. On the other hand, the pattern found in Ancient Greek is exactly what one would expect to emerge from linguistic contact. Even the discrepancy between the vocabulary as a whole and that of the basic 100-word list is the same as that found in England after the Norman Conquest. Estimates vary, but it seems clear that while more than three-quarters of the Middle English vocabulary derived from French, less than 10 percent of the Swadesh list came from the language of the conquerers.24
THE ELEMENTS OF THE GREEK LINGUISTIC AMALGAM
If the mixed origin of Greek is to be seen as the result of contact not shift, with which languages could it have been in contact? Here I shall make a digression. In the summer of 1997, Colin Renfrew invited me to lunch at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was then master. At the lunch I made the case that Greek was not a “shift” but a “contact” language. Though unorthodox for conventional scholars, the idea fit well with Renfrew’s “model of autochthonous origin” for Greece that he had promoted for years. With typical and refreshing hubris he plunged into the field and, the following November, he presented a paper arguing that the bulk of the non–Indo-European vocabulary in Greek derived from an adstrate “or even a superstrate” rather than from a substrate. He published the paper the following year.25 In this he insisted that the adstrate was Minoan. Renfrew’s archaeological justification for this is clear. Abundant evidence exists of Minoan material culture and its influence in Mycenaean Greece 1600–1200 BCE, which was clearly an important period in the formation of the Greek language. Furthermore, the Mycenaean script Linear B was adapted from Minoan Linear A. It is also likely that a considerable portion of the language of Linear A was West Anatolian and, therefore, Indo-Hittite.26 Unfortunately, Renfrew does not appear



122 BLACK ATHENA
to have consulted anyone who knew West Semitic or Ancient Egyptian and he failed to note the substantial work carried out on Semitic loans into Greek. Had he done so he would have discovered that most of the words on which he based his case had well established Semitic or SemitoEgyptian etymologies.27 The best way to explain this apparent discrepancy is to assume that the Minoan language itself received many loans from Semitic and Egyptian. The archaeological evidence of substantial contacts and exchanges between Egypt, the Levant and Crete during the Third and early Second Millennia BCE is outlined in Volume 2.28 Cyrus Gordon may not have shown that the language of Linear A was Semitic but he did demonstrate some significant Semitic loans in it.29 It is also likely that these Semitic and Egyptian loans were precisely in the areas of luxury and sophistication, which were later passed on to Greek. Some of the Egyptian loans into Greek indicate such an early date that they can only have been introduced to the mainland before the arrival of the Proto-Greeks or, more likely, the loans were introduced to Crete during the Third Millennium and later passed on into Greek.30 In the future, scholars may be able to distinguish specific words as either indirect or direct loans from Egyptian and West Semitic but at present it is impossible to know what phonetic changes passage through Minoan would have involved. Therefore, one should merely go to the sources, the two most widespread and culturally significant languages of the east Mediterranean in the Second Millennium BCE, West Semitic and Ancient Egyptian. Not only are these languages understood (unlike Minoan), but they were spoken by peoples about whom we have a considerable amount of evidence from documents and archaeology. The rest of this chapter is concerned with the level least affected by extra–Indo-European influence—phonology.
THE PHONOLOGIES OF INDO-HITTITE AND INDO-EUROPEAN
It must be emphasized here again, that I do not claim that Greek is anything but an Indo-European language. Its morphology fits into the family as well as does any other member and better than most. Its verbal system appears to be closer to that of PIE than any other language except Sanskrit. This is not surprising as Greek is, apart from Hittite, by far the oldest attested Indo-European language. It is not the archaism but



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 123
the degree of modification that is remarkable. Mycenaean Greek is recorded from the Fifteenth to the Thirteenth centuries BCE and the Homeric language would seem to be equally if not more archaic. Nevertheless, there appears to have been considerable change in both the morphology and the phonology between the disintegration of PIE and the earliest attestation of Greek. While the morphology of the Greek verbal system appears to have been remarkably close to that of PIE, the opposite is true of nouns. The Greek nominal declension lost three IndoEuropean cases: the ablative, locative and instrumental in the singular and the first two in the plural. This is in contrast to Latin, first recorded a thousand years later, which retained the ablative and Lithuanian which today still has the original eight cases. The degree of phonological change is difficult to assess as there is much disagreement over the reconstruction of this aspect of PIE. I shall leave aside, for the moment, the vowels and focus on the consonants and, in particular, on the stops. The conventional view of these today modifies a four-series system established in the 1870s by the Neo-Grammarians, who drew upon a comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek and Latin systems to produce the following:
(b) bh p d dh t g gh k
gw ghw kw31
Such a system is unparalleled in any living language in none of which was there a series of voiced aspirates without another of the unvoiced
set, ph, th, kh and khw. For this reason, the linguist Oswald Szemerényi
proposed reinserting the unvoiced aspirates ph etc. into the matrix and deriving the voiced ones from stop +h.32 Four-way systems have not been found elsewhere. Nevertheless, by making the voiced aspirates secondary Szemerényi believed that he had solved the typological problem, as the three-way structure he proposed occurs frequently elsewhere. Szemerényi’s new scheme, however, still encountered the previous difficulties that had made linguists abandon the unvoiced aspirates because evidence from daughter languages pointed to voicing.33 These continuing problems forced a major revision that took place almost simultaneously in the United States and the Soviet Union. Paul Hopper, Thomas Gamkrelidze and Vjac=eslav Ivanov all agreed that what



124 BLACK ATHENA
had previously been seen as plain voiced stops should be interpreted as glottalics or ejectives. They proposed two other series: one voiced and the other unvoiced with phonetic but not phonemic alternations between plain and aspirated stops. This proposal produced the following scheme:
I II III (p') bh/b ph/p t' dh/d th/t k' gh/g kh/k k'w gwh/gw kwh/kw
Such a system appears frequently in other languages. It also provides a number of other advantages over the traditional schemes. First, the absence or extreme rarity of the sound reconstructed as /b/ in the traditional schemes is unique among languages that have labial series. The absence of an emphatic p', however, is quite normal. Second, while voiced stops are frequently used as inflexional affixes and pronouns, glottalized stops are not and this series does not appear in these functions in IndoEuropean. Third, root structure restraint laws in Indo-European appear arbitrary if one follows the traditional system. Under the new one, they are simple voicing agreements and a prohibition of two glottalics in a single root.34 Fifth, the fact that Armenian and Germanic have similar stop systems, which are unlike all the other Indo-European languages, is less easily explained as two independent developments among language speakers who had no contact with each other than as the two surviving archaic forms (the emphatics simply became unvoiced stops). A further advantage is that the emphatic scheme makes it easier to fit Indo-European into the larger language super-families, Euroasiatic and Nostratic. A large number of Indo-Europeanists have accepted much or all of the new scheme, though others have not.35 Most in the latter group simply assert that reconstruction from within Indo-European is the only acceptable method and that the typological arguments should be subordinated to these. Others continue to work within the traditional framework oblivious to the new challenges.36 To my knowledge, the best scholarly argument against the new system from the traditional point of view is that made by Oswald Szememrényi. Szememrényi warns against accepting typological arguments on the ground that oddities or even hapakes (single exceptions) occur in all languages. He has, furthermore,



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 125
found a language, Kelabit in Sarawak, which has the same set he recon
structed for PIE, d-dh-t-th. He also argues that the b/p' is not absent from PIE, although he admits its rarity. He points out that previous scholars have shown that the so-called restraints are simply assimilations of irregularities. He further claims that Hopper, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov have not shown the stages through which the glottalics could have become plain voiced stops when it is known that “unaspirated stops are among the most stable known.”37 These are powerful arguments but I believe that they fail to refute the new scheme. Clearly oddities do occur in all languages, but the extreme rarity of the traditional PIE phonological system does not render the scheme impossible, although it does make it unlikely. Szemerényi’s case that b/p' occurs occasionally, which Hopper, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov all admit, does not overthrow this part of the argument. Even rarity would be puzzling if the original stop really had been a /b/. Hence, the restraints remain significant, even if a few exceptions occur. One of the attractions of the new scheme is that glottalics and most other emphatics are neither voiced nor unvoiced; therefore, “they can fall either way.” Gamkrelidze takes an example from the northeastern Caucasian languages Batsbi, Chechen and Inguish. He shows that in medial and final positions Batsbi glottalics develop into voiced stops in the other two languages.38 Finally, Szemerényi does not deal with the advantages of the glottalic theory in helping situate Indo-European within the larger linguistic macrofamilies. The Russian linguist Sergej Starostin, however, has raised another objection to the glottalic theory. Starostin believes in a restricted Euroasiatic language family consisting merely of Indo-European, Uralic and Altaic. He does not accept close relations with Kartvelian or North Caucasian, let alone with Dravidian or Afroasiatic.39 He argues that glottalics do not occur within his narrow Euroasiatic family and therefore are unlikely to have occurred in PIE. He maintains that this stop series must have been marked in a different way, possibly “tense” as opposed to “lax.” He backs this hypothesis by citing the so-called “Winter’s Law,” which is applicable to Balto-Slavic languages. According to this construction, vowels preceding stops of series I are lengthened. Gamkrelidze sees no difficulty with this idea, although his “lengthening” glottalics would require an additional laryngeal.40 Starostin and the IndoEuropeanist N. E. Collinge argue that, if anything, glottalics shorten preceding consonants.41 I find this second argument plausible, although



126 BLACK ATHENA
not Starostin’s. As can be seen from earlier chapters, I side with those who take a larger view of Nostratic, one that includes Kartvelian, North Caucasian and Afroasiatic. In all of these glottalics are or have been abundant. Thus, there is no inherent reason why PIE should not have preserved this archaic feature after Uralic and Altaic had lost it.
PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS FROM PIE TO GREEK
It would seem prudent to accept the new system, while remaining agnostic as to the exact articulation of the emphatic series. In either case, Greek would seem to have modified its consonants more than many IndoEuropean languages.42 Even under the phonological system of the NeoGrammarians, Greek would appear to have been very innovative. Thus combining the phonetic, the morphological and the lexical (see Chapters 7 and 8) evidence provides a picture of extraordinary transformation between the break-up of PIE which is conventionally dated to the last half of the Fourth Millennium, and the earliest known Greek. These changes, which took place in less than 1,500 years, were far greater by every measure than those over the succeeding 33 centuries during which the Greek language, although helped by a strong literary tradition, has survived many major invasions and social upheavals with remarkable tenacity. Both the Revised Ancient Model and the Aryan Model offer explanations for this early transformation. The former model offers direct and indirect (through Crete) influences on Greek from the Afroasiatic in the Third and early Second Millennium. The Egyptian and Semitic spoken by the settlers of the early Mycenaean period and intensive later contacts would have substantially modified the local Indo-European dialect. The Revised Ancient Model, however, also accepts that later Greek could have been affected by internal developments within Indo-European and by a possible Indo-Hittite substratum. Proponents of the Aryan Model rely solely on internal developments and an undetermined pre-Hellenic substratum. Indo-Europeanists have long recognized that “substrates” can significantly affect the language of the conquerors. Antoine Meillet, for instance, pointed out that the contrast between Armenian, which retained its declension but lost all markers of gender, and the Iranian of “Persian,” which lost both, can be explained by the characteristics of the non–Indo-European languages



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 127
of the regions. South Caucasian and Urartian in the first case and Elamite in the second already possessed these traits.43 In Chapter 4, I mentioned that Szemerényi had proposed substantial contact and linguistic flow between Indo-European and Semitic. Observing the transformation of the PIE five-vowel system (a,e,i,o,u or a–,e–,io–,u–) to the three vowels of Indo-Iranian (a,i,u or a–,i–,u–) he linked the reduction to what he saw as the vowel system of Proto-Semitic. Saul Levin has argued that the latter had a more complex system.44 This issue, however, is unimportant, because Akkadian, the language with which Indo-Iranian speakers would have been in contact, did have that threevowel system with the exception of an /e/ whose presence Szemerényi somewhat glosses over. Szemerényi maintains that speakers of ProtoSemitic had been ruled by Indo-Iranians during long periods of the Second Millennium BCE.45 The significance of Szemerényi’s considerable work in this area is that he has pioneered a new comparison of IndoEuropean and Semitic. Given their historical and geographical proximity and the fact that these two language families have been superbly studied in great detail, such a comparison might seem obvious. But, as I argued in Chapter 4, Indo-Europeanists’ failure to investigate the striking parallels between the gender systems of PIE and Semitic demonstrates that Szemerényi’s work required originality if not real courage.46 While accepting the possible importance of substrates, we can add another principle to the study of the languages of the ancient East Mediterranean: linguistic “convergence.” In general, convergence has been investigated far less than “divergence,” which has been the basis of historical linguistics, devoted to the ramifications of language families. Recent scholars have pointed out that not only can languages be influenced by substrates but also that contiguous languages can have phonetic, phonemic and morphological resemblance’s brought about by new changes cutting across “genetic” language boundaries.47 Today, the French Academy and German linguistic purists worry about English vocabulary entering everyday speech and colloquial writing but they are also concerned about English influence on syntax and grammar. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the boot was on the other foot; the Dickensian /w/ for /v/ in “wery” seems to have been a Cockney imitation of an affected French accent. Similarly, the Parisian uvular /r/ spread among fashionable people outwards from the cities of western Europe.48 On the grammatical plane, the pretorite simple past “made” has given ground to the compound perfect with the auxiliary “have” “have made” in languages



128 BLACK ATHENA
influenced by seventeenth-century France during the reign of Louis XIV. Usually, as in the instances given here, speakers of the modifying language have higher political and cultural status than those of the language affected. Enough examples of substrate influence exist to indicate, however, that this is not always the case. Even contemporary innovations can come from people of lower status. It has been plausibly argued, for instance, that many of the innovations of American English came from the Creoles spoken by African slaves.49 Did any of these processes occur in Greek in its formative period? It would seem worthwhile to look at Greek divergences from PIE to see if they can best be explained by impulses already in the original language, from a substrate or from convergence. No doubt that convergence was at work round the eastern Mediterranean during the Third and Second Millennia BCE. Cyrus Gordon and Gary Rendsburg have shown that Egyptian had a profound lexical morphological and syntactic influence on Canaanite during this period.50 In all cases it would seem useful to consider Greek with other languages with the same or similar features or innovations and—if possible—to establish directional flow. To do this, I have chosen fifteen phonological changes that appear to have taken place in Greek after the separation from PIE.51 Eleven of these changes had occurred before the standardization of Linear B orthography, which probably took place considerably earlier than its first attestation at the end of the seventeenth century BCE.52 Four others shifted after this but before the creation of the epic style contained in Homer. They follow in approximate chronological order.
Fifteen phonological changes
1. LOSS OF LARYNGEALS. By the time of the break-up of Indo-European in the narrow sense, the earlier laryngeal system had been reduced to a single /h/; even this disappeared except in Armenian where it seems to have survived for some time as a result of local Anatolian influences. Laryngeals appear to have been absent from Germanic before its voiceless stops became fricatives.53 In Greek, the laryngeals may have influenced the aspiration of stops and their phonemicization. The loss is obviously extremely early. Unless the pre-Hellenic differed greatly from the Anatolian languages,



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 129
in which laryngeals still clearly flourished in the Second Millennium, there can be no question of substrate influence in this change. Similarly, because laryngeals continued to be strong in Caucasian, West Semitic and Egyptian, the innovation could not have come from any of these. Given the earlier weakening of the system and the fact that the disappearance of the laryngeal /H/ was widespread among Indo-European languages, it would seem almost certain that the innovation was the result of tendencies already present in the proto-language.54
2. THE MERGER OF STOPS AND ASPIRATES. It seems likely that a phonemic distinction developed between voiced and unvoiced stops and their previously allophonic aspirates in the ancestors of Indo-Iranian Greek and Italic. In Indo-Iranian, all four series maintained their independence.55 In Greek they appear to have merged in the following way:
ph th kh kwh
> p t k kw
b d g gw
bh dh gh gwh > ph th kh kwh
(p') t' k' kw' > (b) d g gw 56
The situation is further complicated by the likelihood that Macedonian and Phrygian, which in many other respects are close to Greek, apparently did not go through these changes.57 This complication (and the fact that the mergers are unlike anything known of Anatolian, Semitic and Egyptian) make it impossible for the merger to have been a real feature of the East Mediterranean. Unless the pre-Hellenic language was completely different from any of these, the change is unlikely to come from substrate influence. We know that widely in Indo-European aspirated and non-aspirated allophones of the voiced series split, but no explanation can be given for their distinctive rearrangements in Greek.58
3. THE SHIFT FROM EMPHATIC TO VOICED STOPS. Emphatic (sometimes
glottalic) stops appear to have existed throughout Indo-Hittite, Afroasiatic and the Caucasian languages. They or creaky voiced or implosive developments seem to have persisted long enough after the disintegration of Indo-European for some other consonantal shifts to have taken place. Thus, in Germanic and Armenian, where the voiceless stops become



130 BLACK ATHENA
voiceless fricatives or aspirates, the spaces or cas vides were filled by the
previously emphatic stops. Thus p'> p, t' >t, k'>k and kw' >kw. In Greek and Italic the unvoiced series was already filled (see above) and the empty slot was the voiced series. In Anatolian stops fell together, each setdentals, labials, etc.—merged. The situation is equally confusing in Semitic. Glottalic stops survived in Ge'ez and the northern Ethiopic language Tigrinya and in some south Arabian languages.59 In Arabic, however, while the emphatic series maintains its independence it has become pharyngealized. The Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew tsade as ts and its transcription in Greek as /ss/as in buvsso"(5) from the West Semitic bus≥ make it probable that the emphatics were still glottalized in Canaanite in the Second Millennium.60 In Egyptian it is likely that /q/, the only surviving emphatic, was deglottalized very early and that by the beginning of the Second Millennium it was merging with the neutralizing g/k.61 The absence of emphatics in Egyptian and Anatolian may have hastened their disappearance in Greek. On the other hand, as the process was almost universal among Indo-European languages, it is likely that the series was already unstable to the point of disintegration and that Greek merely shared in this general trend.
4. THE WEAKENING OF INTERVOCALIC -S- AND THE REPLACEMENT OF INITIAL
S- BY H-. Unlike the innovations mentioned above these shifts have a fairly coherent temporal and geographical distribution.
Germanic, Hittite, Hurrian, Kartvelian, Urartian? Albanian, Phrygian, Armenian Italic, Greek, Lydian, Lycian, Avestan, Sanskrit, Ugaritic Aramaic Canaanite Arabic Sabean
Eblaite Akkadian, Amorite? Egyptian, Minean, Qatabanian Hadramitic GeŒez
The shift occurred only in the italicized languages. Those languages unaffected by the shift tend to have been either ancient or geographically peripheral. This distribution indicates that the innovation was centered in the East Mediterranean in the Second Millennium BCE. Such shifts are acknowledged but unexplained in Indo-European. While Semitists do not generally acknowledge these shifts, they can be seen in three fundamental areas: pronouns, conjunctions and verbal prefixes.



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 131
In Canaanite initial h- was largely restricted to pronouns and other basic words. In other vocabulary items the shift was often from s>h≥, as in such Hebrew doublets as sl ̈m/h≥lm “healthy” and sr ̈b/h≥rb “parched.”63 Despite the fact that Ge'ez, which is otherwise archaic, has forms with /h/ or /h≥/, /s/ is primary in Semitic. Not only is it attested in the oldest languages, Eblaite and Akkadian, but it has cognates in other Afroasiatic languages. In Egyptian the third-person dependent pronouns are swt sy or st, the causative prefix is s- and the word for “healthy” snb cognate with sl ̈m/h≥lm.64 There are also relics in later languages of s- in situations usually occupied by h-. Thus, the shift s>h is sporadic in Semitic while, except before stops, s>h is universal in Armenian, Greek and Avestan. Nevertheless, the examples given above show that the shift’s occurrence in Semitic was sufficiently systematic for it to be considered alongside that in the Indo-European languages given their geographical contiguity. Yet another example of the shift comes from the Anatolian language of Lycian. It is now agreed that Luvian written in cuneiform, “hieroglyphic Hittite,” and Lycian written alphabetically should both be seen as different stages of the same language or close linguistic family.65 The orthographies of the first two were probably established in the Third Millennium. I have argued elsewhere that Lycian spelling was conventionalized in the Second.66 From Greek transcriptions we have information about its pronunciation in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. The shift s>h took place between the establishment of the first Hittite and Luvian, on the one hand, and Lycian, on the other. For instance, the Luvian possessive suffix was -assi, while in Lycian it was -ahi or -ehi though in one dialect it was still -esi. The Luvian for “god” was masana; in Lycian it became mahana, which in the First Millennium was reduced still further to man.67 It is interesting to note that not only did these shifts occur in the same

132 BLACK ATHENA
general region but also they all appear to have taken place in the Second Millennium. Since it is attested in Linear B, the shift must have occurred in Greek before that orthography was established around or earlier than 1600 BCE. Szemerényi gives a terminus post quem for the Lycian shift of 1200 BCE, when the Hittite New Kingdom broke up.68 I see no reason why, on the grounds given above, it should not have been earlier. Nevertheless, the social and political upheavals at that time would seem a plausible context for the change. The establishment of the conventions of Eblaite and Akkadian orthography around the middle of the Third Millennium provides a terminus post quem for the shift in Asiatic Semitic. Another important temporal indication comes from Ugaritic where the causative remained s-, while the pronouns, and the conjunction had already changed to h- before the spelling was fixed. Thus, here the indications are that the shift was taking place in the first half of the Second Millennium BCE. It is impossible to date the shift in Armenian though it may have come as a result of the change in Iranian, which in itself is very hard to periodize. Szemerényi argues that the Armenian shift must date from the tenth century BCE because the Old Persian-Hindu (Indus) for the Indo-Aryan Sindhu and the Old Persian Huza for the Elamite Susa are supposed to indicate that the shift can only have been taking place when Iranians occupied or were close to the regions concerned. If I understand this argument correctly, it is absurd. Peoples’ names for distant places, especially capitals—Susa was the capital of Elam—and major rivers, are susceptible to influence from the native pronunciation. However, they usually undergo the normal sound shifts. For instance, one cannot draw any conclusions on the whereabouts of the Dutch from the fact that they call Berlin, Paris and Turin Berlijn, Parijs and Turijn. Simply, the language went through a shift i(i–)>ij(ei). In any event, this low dating is clearly wrong because it is now generally agreed that Zoroaster and the Gatha poems attributed to him—in which the s>h shift had already taken place—should be put in the twelfth or thirteenth centuries BCE. Even if the shift can be shown to have taken place before then, some serious difficulties remain in linking it to that in the other languages. The major objection is the presence of “s-speaking” Indo-Aryans in the Mittanni Kingdom in northern Mesopotamia in the fourteenth century BCE. Thus, either the shift took place after this or it happened earlier but farther to the north and east. In either case, there is a disjunction of either time or space with the other similar shifts.69



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 133
The only possibility would be to link it to the spread of Old Aramaic into Assyria, which could have taken place in the thirteenth century even, although it is only attested three hundred years later. This, however, is far too flimsy evidence on which to build a case. In any event, even without knowledge of the changes, if any, in the intervening languages (Hurrian, Urartian and Elamite) it is impossible to say anything of significance about the relation of the Avestan shift to those elsewhere. The relative coincidences of time and place remain suggestive. It should be remembered, however, how easily this particular shift s>h (which is merely one form of a weakening of a consonant) can occur without any obvious outside stimulus; for instance the shift of this type appeared in Welsh, but no other Celtic language.70 In short, Greek development did occur at approximately the same time in several nearby languages to the east. With the possible exception of West Semitic, where the shift was incomplete, the Greek change appears to have taken place earlier than the others.
5. THE SHIFT FROM INITIAL y- TO h- OR ZERO AND ITS WEAKENING OR DISAP
PEARANCE IN OTHER POSITIONS. These changes occurred in Greek about the time of the establishment of Linear B.71 Armenian too has some modification of y- but no clear-cut shift can be discerned.72 During the Third Millennium, presumably under the pressure from Sumerian, the Akkadian initial y- disappeared or was reduced to >aleph.73 Canaanite has remarkably few words with initial y- that are not etymologically derived from w- (see below).74 In both Canaanite and Aramaic intervocalic -y- underwent syncope.75 There is also the apparent change in the vocalizing of the Egyptian sign of a reed, transcribed ˆ, from y to >a and the later shift from /i/ to /a/ in closed accented syllables.76 It is interesting to note that, while languages like Italic and Avestan retained at least initial y-, Greek and Armenian, the two Indo-European languages closest to Semitic-speaking areas and with most Semitic loan words, should have shared the latter’s weakening of the semivowel.
6. THE PALATALIZATION OF /ty/ AND /ti/ TO /s/ AND /dy/ TO /z/. These
innovations were probably related to the weakening of y. They occurred in Greece before the standardization of Linear B, but after the shift s>h and were possibly encouraged by the cas vide the latter provided. Although /tt/ is rendered as /s/ in Albanian and /ty/ becomes /ts/ in Canadian French, this change did not appear in other ancient Indo-European



134 BLACK ATHENA
languages.77 Allen Bomhard has argued plausibly that Proto-Semitic con
tained a series of palatalized dentals /t≥y /, /ty/ and /dy/.78 Since they survive as interdentals, however, they are usually represented as such in reconstructions. The series merged with /s≥/ /s/ and /z/ in Akkadian at the very beginning of the Second Millennium.79 They survived indepen
dently in Ugaritic. Nevertheless, the shift ty> s etc. may have begun in Phoenician well before 1500 BCE.80 This possibility could link the Phoenician shift with Greece and especially with Mycenae. While the
shift ty> s was pan-Hellenic, its extension ti>si, occurred in Ionic and Arkado-Cypriot and, possibly in Mycenaean but not in Doric. At that time Doric was the language of northwest Greece and was therefore least affected by palatial culture with its Levantine connections.81 The system of palatalized dentals collapsed throughout Asiatic Semitic. In Arabic they kept their independence but became interdentals. In GeŒez, however, they turned into sibilants, an indication of how easy this outcome can be. Given their geographical proximity and their intense cultural contacts, the Canaanite shift can plausibly be derived from the Akkadian one, despite the possible Arabic solution and the Aramaic
change ty> t. Whether the Greek shift can be linked to the Canaanite is more debatable. The main problem is that posed by the place-name
Tyre. If the name had been pronounced T≥ (y)or in the first half of the
Second Millennium, its appearance in Greek as Tyros would require its
borrowing before the Canaanite shift t≥y > s≥ but after the Greek shift. In any other case, it would have emerged as *Sur [Sor is, in fact, the old Latin form borrowed from the Canaanite S≥≥or].82 Thus, there must have been a period after the Greek change but before the Canaanite. The only other possibilities would be that the Semitic series were interdental, as they are conventionally rendered, or they were palato-alveolar affricates
not recognized by Greek speakers as their own /ty/. The latter possibility would indicate either that the changes were unrelated or that they took place in the Aegean before they occurred in the Levant. Nevertheless, the coincidence, coupled with the uniqueness of the Greek shift within Indo-European, would lead one to believe that areal factors were in some way involved.
7. THE PALATALIZATION OF ky> ss. This change does not appear to have been part of the general phonemesization of palatalized velars, before front vowels, associated with the breakdown of labiovelars that seems to have spread from the ancestor of Indo-Iranian to those of Balto-Slavic,



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 135
Armenian and Albanian: the so-called “satem languages.”83 The Greek
shift seems to have paralleled the one from ty> s and, like the latter, it occurred between the shift s>h and the orthographic formation of Linear B. No independent series of palatalized velars exists in Asiatic Semitic. Nevertheless, there are indications from the Gunnan-Gurage languages of Ethiopia and correspondences between /k/ and /s/ in other languages that such a series may have existed in Proto-Semitic.84 It is impossible to say for certain if it existed in Asiatic Semitic, let alone for how long. Thus, for the present at least, one cannot link this Greek innovation to any Semitic or other areal tendency.
8. THE DEVELOPMENT OF -ss-/-tt-. Apart from the shifts kys>ss and tys>ss, many Greek words with the alternations -ss-/-tt- appear to have been loans.85 The simplest explanation is that these forms were borrowed from Semitic sibilants that did not exist in Greek or any other Indo-European language. The most obvious candidate is the Semitic emphatic dental affricate /s≥/. Its early phonetic value has been debated, but the argument that the present Ashkenazic pronunciation of s≥ade as an emphatic
ts' is the original seems to have prevailed.86 This pronunciation and the rarity of these geminated consonants would explain the alternations.87 Other Afroasiatic sibilants, however, also appear to have sounded uncertain to Greek speakers and to have appeared in many different forms including -ss-/-tt-. Probably the best-known example of the alternation is qavlassa/qavlatta “sea,” the most plausible etymology for which is the Egyptian tÅs=(discussed in Chapter 8).88
9. FINAL -m TO FINAL -n. It is conceivable that Linear B lacked final consonants because Mycenaean Greek did not possess them.89 In any event, it is impossible to date the shift -m >-n beyond saying that it was pre-Homeric. The same change occurred in many other Indo-Hittite languages, notably Venetic, Germanic and Hittite. That some Venetic dialects did not appear to have experienced the change has led to the plausible suggestion it was late in that language.90 This change came much later still to Germanic and is also incomplete. The early occurrence in Anatolia, however, makes it possible that the Greek innovation could have resulted from an Indo-Hittite substratum. On the other hand, it could equally well have come from Akhaian (Anatolian) influence in the fourteenth century BCE or simply from an independent development. The occurrence of the same shift in Aramaic and Arabic may also have been the result of Anatolian influence.



136 BLACK ATHENA
10. LOSS OF FINAL DENTALS. Finals -t and -d appear to have been common in PIE. They do not occur in the Greek of Linear B or Homer. The only other Indo-Hittite language that appears to have dropped them is Lycian.91 The Greek loss, however, is unlikely to be the result of any Indo-Hittite substrate influence because these dentals are frequent in Lydian.92 Even more strikingly, they seem to occur in Phrygian, which was in most respects Greek’s closest linguistic relative.93 This makes it almost certainly a Late Bronze Age innovation. As discussed in Chapter 4, final -t is extremely common in Afroasiatic especially as a feminine marker of nouns and verbs. This dental was disappearing from Eblaite in the middle of the Third Millennium and dropped from Egyptian at the end of the Middle Kingdom. The process, however, probably started much earlier.94 The disappearance from Canaanite was later and less complete. In Canaanite the disappearance of final -t from feminine suffixes occurred rather later. Zellig Harris put various shifts in or around the fifteenth century.95 Although, as I have argued above, the Eblaite final -a in the feminine may have influenced that in PIE, it does not appear to have been part of a trend in Akkadian. In the Second Millennium there seems to have been an isogloss linking Egypt, Phoenicia, Greece and Lycia in this respect. If these changes can be causally linked, they would seem to have started in Egypt spreading elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean between 1700 and 1300 BCE.
11. FORMATION OF PROTHETIC VOWELS. Although prothetic vowels occur in many Indo-European languages, they are much more frequent in Greek than elsewhere.96 As these have not been reconstructed for PIE, it is believed that most of those found in “daughter” languages derive from lost laryngeals. Another source stems from a reluctance to begin words with complicated consonant clusters. It is often difficult to distinguish between these two sources. For instance, there has been considerable debate about whether the prothetic letters found in many languages before words for “name” (e.g., the Greek ónoma and the Irish ainm) come from a lost laryngeal *Hnm(n) or from the reduction of a root *nmn to zero grade that bring the initial n- and the medial -m- together, forming an intolerable initial cluster.97 Historical linguists are less concerned with the Greek prothetic vowels deriving from these two sources, which can be found in other Indo-European languages, than they are with the exceptional number found in Greek.98



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 137
The only Indo-European language with a similarly high number of these vowels is Armenian. Indeed, this seems to have been a principal reason why Greek and Armenian have been considered to have a special relationship within Indo-European.99 James Clackson, who has written the latest monograph on the relationship between Greek and Armenian, denies that parallels between prothetic vowels in the two languages can be used to show any exclusive relationship between them.100 In any event, of the eight words that he admits as possible indications of this formation, one ast- “star” was, as we saw in Chapter 4, common to IndoEuropean.101 For the complications of another form erek and the Greek e]rebo" (H) “evening,” see below.102 The parallel between the Greek o]neidoV (H) “reproach” and the Armenian anek' “curse” is loose both semantically and phonetically. The remainder could well be early loans from Greek into Armenian. Most plausibly the high incidence of prothetic vowels in Greek can be explained by the large number of Egyptian or West Semitic loans or copies into Greek. These loans or copies most likely either had prothetic vowels in the source language or began with the Afroasiatic consonants >aleph and Œayin which did not exist in Greek and were, therefore, reduced to prothetic vowels. Sometimes the Egyptian /h/ or even / ̇/ reduced to zero. Finally, they could derive from Late Canaanite which had a tendency to drop the initial h-, notably from the definite article ha. Furthermore, Egyptian, Semitic and Hurrian all have prothetic vowels with these and other consonants usually attached to avoid difficult initial clusters. In Egyptian these were seldom written and their quality is uncertain.103 They were written with an /ˆ/, which though undoubtedly short could have been rendered >a-, >e- or >i-. In Canaanite the vowel generally seems to have been an e-.104 The Greek and Armenian prothetic vowels, however, also generally varied between a- and e-, although forms with o- do appear.105 At this point, I shall only attempt to give examples of the various types. First come borrowings from >aleph, starting with a[lfa (4) itself. The Greek h|mar “day,” originally pronounced h\mar (H) and originally meaning not “day” but “fate of the day,” derives from the attested Egyptian form ˆmy hrwf “guardian of the day.”106 The Greek medical term ivnavw “evacuate, purge” would seem to come from the Egyptian medical term ˆnˆ “remove.” Then there is ojqovnh (H) “fine linen, sails, shrouds” and the Canaanite >et|≥u{n “linen of Egypt, thread, cord,” itself from the Egyp
tian ˆdmˆ “red linen.”107 The Late Greek ojuraio" (CE5) derives from



138 BLACK ATHENA
the Egyptian ˆŒrt “Uraeus.” Finally, the attested Late Egyptian form ˆkm from km “completion” provides a good etymology for aaaaajkkmmhh
kkmmhh
kmh: (H) “highest or culminating point, full grown.”108 Two twentieth century lexicographers of Greek, the Swede Hjalmar Frisk and the Frenchman Pierre Chantraine, link it to what they see as an Indo-European root *ak- “sharp.” Chantraine, however, admits that he can find no parallel for the devel
opment ajk-mh.v As examples of Greek prothetic vowels deriving from Œayin there are ajkri|bhv" (4) “exact” from the Egyptian ŒqÅ ˆb “precise, straightforward”
and o[cccccllllloVVVVV (5) “crowd, many” from the Egyptian Œ S+Åt “swarm, crowd, many.”109 Copies resulting from Afroasiatic forms beginning with /h/ or /h≥/ include Aiguvpto" Aikupitiyo from H≥t kÅ Pth≥, e[beno" (5) from hbny and i|bi" (5) from hby.110 Finally, we come to Afroasiatic words that possessed prothetic vowels despite the fact that they were seldom written.111 Scholars are divided as to whether Egyptian s(Å)q “join together” or “sack” (sok, sook, sak or so\(o\)k in Coptic) was copied into Akkadian as S+akku and Canaanite as savq or the process was reversed.112 Whether from Egyptian or Canaanite, it generated two Greek forms savk(k)o" (4) and with a prothetic a-, ajskov" (7).113 The Greek ajspiv" (H) “shield” would seem to come from the Canaanite root s≥ph/y “metal plate, cover” attested in Ugaritic, Hebrew and Neo-Punic. Aspiv" (5) “asp,” an Egyptian snake, almost certainly comes from the Egyptian Sbi “the rebel serpent” a well-known demon.114 Diodoros Sikeliotes reported that Egyptian priests had told him that the ancient Athenian name for their city a[stu (H) came from the city name Asty in Egypt.115 A town called ˆst existed in the Second Lower Egyptian nome and the temple of Ptah at Thebes was called ˆsty. Anne Burton, in her commentary on Diodoros Book 1, denies the first town as an influence on the grounds that by classical times it would have been pronounced *Es|e. On the other hand, she accepts that the /t/would have been preserved in the second example.116 I see no reason to date the hypothetical copying after the disappearance of final -t. Furthermore, the /t/ was clearly written and there is no reason to suppose that Diodoros’ informants were illiterate. As astu was not restricted to Athens, however, it seems to me more likely that asty is at least partially derived from the Egyptian ˆst “palace” or ( ˆ)st “place.”117 The Egyptian ˆrp “wine” appeared in Greek as e[rpi or e{rpi(5). There is the clear-cut example of the Canaanite article creating a prothetic a- in the name of the highest



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 139
mountain in Rhodes Atabuvrio√ from *Hatt`å`bôr the same as Mount T≥åbôr in Palestine.118 All in all, the high frequency of prothetic vowels in Greek does not have to be explained as a “genetic” peculiarity. It simply seems to have been the result of a large number of words accurately or loosely copied from Afroasiatic.
12. THE SHIFT FROM A–TO E–. This shift occurred after the conventionalizing of Linear B and was never completed. It took place only in Ionian and, to a slightly lesser extent, Attic. All the other dialects preserved the Indo-European long /a–/. The lower date for the shift is set before the standardization of Homeric spelling in the Late Bronze Age. Many IndoEuropeanists accept some antiquity and recognize that the shift had ceased to operate before long /a–/ was created by contraction or new loans were introduced into the Ionian spoken in the south and east. In Lycian, at some stage, /a–/ often became /e–/. The variation was not related to open or closed vowels, so stress or, more likely, vowel length might have been the basis. With vowel length, one cannot say whether it was the long or the short vowels that were affected because vowel length is not marked in the script. Vowel length would seem the more likely not only because of the Greek parallel but also because in Ugarit (whose population included many Luvian/Lycian speakers) /a>/(which later became /a–/) shifted to/e>/.119 Although writers on Anatolian languages generally see the Lycian shift as having taken place in the First Millennium, it seems more plausible to me to suppose that the change took place in speech long before it was recognized in writing.120 In any case, the Ugaritic shift had taken place by the fifteenth century, and it is striking that two contiguous languages, spoken under the Hittite political regime or sovereignty in the Second Millennium and under the NeoHittite principalities in the early part of the First Millennium should have gone through similar sound shifts. It is also remarkable that to the south of Ugarit long /a–/ broke down in the famous “Canaanite shift” a–>o–, which, according to Zellig Harris, began “probably before the early fifteenth century.” A similar change took place in Egyptian during this period or a little later in what must be a related areal change within the Egyptian sphere of influence.121 Further shifts a–>u–and a>o took place later in Phoenician.122 One striking example of the results of the different shift a–>e–and a–>ocomes from the two Greek words, whose similarities of sound and meaning intrigued Plato: sw§ma, genitive swvmatoı (H) “corpse” and sh§ma,



140 BLACK ATHENA
shvmatoı (H) “tomb.”123 The argument made by Plato and later lexicographers that se@ma “tomb” came from sh§ma (H) “sign” is semantically possible but improbable se@ma “sign” is far more likely to derive from the Canaanite se@m “name, sign.”124 In Middle Egyptian there was a term smÅ tÅ “unite (with) the earth.” This was used in two senses: “unite the land” and “be interred, burial” in Late Egyptian. Vycichl, who sees smÅ tÅ as having been used as a single word, reconstructs it in the latter sense of “burial” as *zamÅ-táÅ-. Anglo-American Egyptologists would transcribe this *samÅ-táÅ-.125 Vycichl’s reconstruction seems plausible though the stress pattern may be less certain than he supposes. Not only does *samÅ-táÅ- provide a plausible etymology for both sem§a, semvatos and som§a, somvatos, but also it offers approximate dates for the borrowings. Evidence from both Egyptian and Greek indicates that the loans could not be earlier than the third quarter of the Second Millennium BCE. Clearly /Å/ had lost its consonantal quality. Equally, the initial s- indicates that the loan could not have been made into Greek before the conversion of initial s >h. Otherwise, it would have passed through that shift and become **he@ma. At the other end, se@ma,
originally as the Doric form sa\mva, had to have been transmitted from Egyptian before the Ionic fronting /a–/ to /e–/ in the fourteenth or thirteenth centuries. Similarly, the loan of *samÅ-táÅ- into the Greek se@ma, semvatos took place before the Egypto-Canaanite shifts of long stressed
/a–v/ to /o–v/. In a later form *so\mva-toa- or *so\mvato, it was borrowed to form sw§ma, swvmatoı. Since both words are found in Hesiod and Homer, this can hardly be later than the ninth century BCE. Another example comes from two derivatives of the Egyptian verb ts “knit together, marshal troops.” The word appears in Coptic as joi\s “lord, Jesus” indicating an earlier *ta–s. The noun tsw meant “commander, protector of the poor.” With the shift å>e–*Ta–sw provides an excellent etymology for Qhseuvı The–seús, hero and legendary organizing king of Athens.126 The lonian shift would fit the picture given in Hittite documents of their relations with the A∆∆iyawa, almost certainly Akhaians of the late fourteenth and early thirteenth centuries.127 The difficulty with this is that the shift a–>e–did not affect Arkado-Cypriot, the most archaic Greek dialect closest to Mycenaean and presumably the language of the “Sea People” who settled on Cyprus in the late thirteenth and early twelfth centuries. This objection can be got around, with some additional encumbrance, by arguing that the Greeks, among the Sea Peoples, came



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 141
from the Peloponnese rather than the southern Aegean, but clearly this argument is not very satisfactory. It is, however, less implausible than proposing a shift in the Iron Age when the southern Aegean islands were occupied by Dorian speakers. If we are to believe Homer and the archaeological evidence, the dominant eastern influence on Akhaians and Danaans at this time was from Sidon and Tyre and in their dialects the accented long /a–:/ had many centuries earlier turned to /o–:/. In any event, apart from the possibility that any or all of these shifts could be unrelated, we have no clear indication that it was the long athat was affected in Lycian or that this shift took place in the Second Millennium. Nevertheless, both suppositions would seem plausible and it would seem possible that the shifts a–>o–and a–>e–reflect, respectively, regions of Egyptian and Hittite influence during the Late Bronze Age.
13. THE SHIFT FROM W TO ZERO. The title of this section is somewhat misleading. One of the first great discoveries of classical studies came when Richard Bentley found the hidden  ̧ digamma or /w/.128 Although /w/ was not written in Homeric Greek, its presence, or that of a reflex, was marked by the prohibition of elision of vowels previously sounded with it. Digamma does appear in a few Greek alphabetic dialects, and signs beginning with w- are also present in the orthography of Linear B. Nevertheless, the omission from the Ionian alphabet is significant. In Late Bronze Age Greek /w/ was clearly weakening and had largely disappeared except as a reflex in the First Millennium.129 This change occurred more widely than that from /a–/ to /e–/ but was along the same general lines. It affected Ionian and Attic most strongly. In Arkadian /w/ disappeared medially but not initially. In some Dorian dialects no change occurred. Indeed, /w/ is still used in the Tsakonian dialect of Lakonia, which is descended from a Dorian dialect.130 Many of these instances correspond with Indo-European roots containing /w/. Even when  ̧ is written in archaic dialects, it cannot always be traced back in this way. John Chadwick pointed out that in several instances the initial digamma found in classical inscriptions is not justified etymologically.131 In Chapter 9 below, I will propose that both explicit  ̧ and Greek loan words containing an Afroasiatic ‘ayin and some times even >aleph could prevent elision.132 With this dialectal pattern one might expect to find analogies in the East Mediterranean. In fact, a shift w>y occurred in West Semitic. It took place between the establishment of the orthography of Eblaite and



142 BLACK ATHENA
that of Ugaritic circa 2600–1600 BCE. The shift’s incompleteness in Ugaritic and the sporadic late survival of /w/ in Phoenician, however, would strongly suggest that it began near the end of this span.133 In Late Egyptian, too, long /u–/shifted to long /e–/.134 A similar shift u>i is also found in Mycenaean Greek, although in no other dialect.135 Here too the changes in Semitic and Egyptian are not identical to those in Greek. Furthermore, one should not place much significance on the weakening of an unstable phoneme like /w/. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the Greek dialects of regions that, on documentary, archaeological and legendary grounds, seem to have had most contact with the Levant in the Late Bronze Age, appear to have undergone a similar sound shift to the one described there. The shift w>o– is clearly related to the breakdown of labiovelars at approximately the same time which will be discussed in the next section.
14. THE BREAKDOWN OF GREEK LABIOVELARS, 1: AN AFROASIATIC EXCURSUS.
Before considering the breakdown of Greek labiovelars in the Second Millennium, we need to look more widely at labiovelars and rounded morphemes. They are very common among the world’s languages. For instance, Christopher Ehret is convinced of a four-way set for Afroasiatic:
*gw, *kw, Pw and k’w >.136 Allan Bomhard reconstructs a full set of rounded
velars *gw, *kw[h] and *k >w for Proto-Nostratic. His case is persuasive at least as far as it concerns PIE, Proto-Kartvelian and Proto-Afroasiatic.137
Labiovelars in Semitic. Two examples of parallel labiovelars in Indo-European and Afroasiatic strengthen this hypothesis. The linguist of Ethiopian languages Wolf Leslau tentatively proposed a Cushitic root *Ekwa for “water.”138 Pokorny’s Indo-European root is *Eku-. The Semitic
root ÷qwm “arise, stand up,” is qwämä in most Gurage languages. This corresponds well to the Indo-European root conventionally reconstructed
as *guem but according to the emphatic theory was *qw'em, “come.” It is commonly believed that the labiovelars in Ethiopic Semitic derived from surrounding Cushitic languages. Interestingly their presence and that of other rounded consonants seems more marked in Ethiopic Semitic than in Cushitic. Thus, they are more likely to derive from Proto-Semitic. As I. M. Diakonoff wrote in 1970:
The Proto-Semitic-Hamitic (Afroasiatic) consonant series *gw, *qw, *kw seems to be established reliably enough on the basis of Cushitic and Tchad data; but also in Semitic there is evidence pointing to



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 143
the original existence of these phonemes; apart from their existence in Ethiopic where they might perhaps be due to the existence of a Cushitic substratum. The fact itself that i>u not only in contact with b, p, m, but [in certain cases only!] also with g, q, k is significant.139
Diakonoff was referring here to what he believed to be the fundamental
bivocalism (a/E), plus sonants) of pre-Proto Afroasiatic [Nostratic?].140 According to this scheme, in Semitic, the /a/ stays constant but /i/ and /u/ represent variants of /E/. Incidentally, this would mean that the Ethiopic /E/ could be seen as primary and not secondary as is often supposed. According to Diakonoff ’s scheme of alternating /i/ and /u/,
the Proto-Semitic initials *bE-,*gwE- and *qwE- were rendered bu-, gu-, qu- in Hebrew and Akkadian but bi-, gi, qi- in Arabic with Aramaic
being mixed. He saw *kwE-, and mE- as probably ku and mu in all lan
guages except Ethiopic which retained the kwE-.141 As far as it goes, Diakonoff ’s scheme is very tempting. To go further, however, it is necessary to find not merely more reflexes but actual examples of rounding in general and particularly in labiovelars within Asiatic Semitic. More reflexive evidence comes from an interchange between /g/ and /b/ known in various Canaanite dialects and now found in Eblaite, which the epigrapher and linguist and Giovanni Pettinato described as “interessantisimo.”142 He has not, so far, developed his thoughts on this, but they must include the possibility that the interchange repre
sents a develarization of *gw- to become b-. Further evidence of labiovelars appears to come from two generally archaic linguistic areas: personal pronouns and irregular verbs. The following chart of second-person singular pronouns omits apparently unrelated forms: Second-Person Singular Pronouns

144 BLACK ATHENA
The gender alternation Cw/Cy corresponds to the linguistic universal of /i/ signifying small, light and pretty while /u/ represents the opposite.149 It is universally agreed that the Egyptian hieroglyph conventionally transcribed as /t/ originally derived from a velar /k/. Until recently it
was also accepted that it came from a palatalized *ky-. Christopher Ehret, the specialist in African languages, forcefully argues, however, that /t/
derives from a Proto-Afroasiatic “lateral obstruent” *kw-.150 Whether or not the examples he provides are convincing, the archaic Egyptian masculine form twt is much more plausibly derived from a masculine initial kuw- than from a feminine kia-, given the Semitic parallels. Against this derivation are the Egyptian second-person alternation ntk/ntt and many
other examples suggesting an origin for /t/ from a palatalized *ky, which is a much more frequent shift. The overall pattern indicates that Proto
Afroasiatic had an alternation *kw-/*ky- in the second person. Addition
ally, *sw-/*sy- in third-person pronouns suggest a labiovelar and a rounded /sw/ (see below).151 As for the second-person forms, there is no reason to suppose that they are secondary. None of the surrounding Highland East Cushitic or Omotic languages have similar terms. The most plausible etymology
would be from *an kwE and *an kyE. There is an Argobba form an kä.152 Thus, all of these forms could well derive directly from the Proto-Semitic and be related to the Eblaite and Assyrian kuwati. The similarity of the form in these two languages, as opposed to kati in Akkadian, suggests that, although most Assyrian texts are more recent than those from the southern Mesopotamian ones, in this respect at least the Assyrian are more archaic. One possible explanation is the greater influence in the south of Sumerian, which had very little, if any, rounding.
What reason is there to suppose that kuwa represented *kwa rather than a bisyllabic *ku-wa ? The only answers are the typological one that pronouns tend to be monosyllabic and the analogous one making comparisons with the Ethiopian Semitic languages. Another possibility is found in analogy with the third-person pronouns discussed below. Another possible survival of labiovelars in Asiatic Semitic is in the fundamental verb ÷kwn, kuan–um “stand, exist” in Old Akkadian. Jacques Ryckmans provided the following paradigm for this verb in Assyrian and Babylonian:153



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 145
The evidence from this, too, is ambiguous. While the imperfect would fit
very well with a stem *kwEn, in the perfect the /k/ and the /u/ are separated by an infixed /t/. Similar separations occur in derived conjugations, although they could have been formed by analogy. Taken as a whole, the paradigm is clearly mixed. The problem is whether it is better seen as a triliteral with a weak medial /w/ or as a biliteral modified in some ways to conform with triliterals. Diakonoff argued that if the medial u8 had originally functioned as a consonant one would expect an imperfect form **kau÷an.154 Another argument along the same lines is that, while the Akkadian non-past regularly geminates the second consonant, the u÷is not doubled but the final /n/ is when it is followed by a vowel.155 This indicates that it was seen as the second consonant, preceded by a
single /kw/. Arabic has the same ambiguity, there the medial u8 is doubled in the derived forms, such as kawwana. Here too there are indications that the
root may have been *÷kwEn rather than *÷kwn or *÷kawn.

The vowels /a–/ and /u/ occur in open and closed syllables respectively. The usual explanation given for the alternation has been to suppose that both derive from a diphthong *aw. However, it is also generally considered that, as Zellig Harris put it,
In early Semitic, diphthongs were phonologically vowel + syllable closing [y] or [w]; as such they were always either final or followed by the consonant which began the next syllable: [báytu]. Since every



146 BLACK ATHENA
syllable in early Semitic began with a consonant, inter-vocalic [y] and [w] must be considered phonologically as hetero-syllabic not making a diphthong, but rather beginning the next syllable.156
In this case there would be no distinction between open and closed syllables as they would all be closed. Thus, if such a paradigm were ancient
it would be better explained as deriving from *÷kwn rather than from *÷kwn or *÷kawn. In fact, a form of this type exists in the northern Gurage
language Gogot, where one finds kwänä. The remote eastern Ethiopian
dialect of Zway has the spirantized xwänä. The loan of this word into the Greek, koinovVVVVV (H) “common, public, impartial” from the Canaanite ÷kwn “establish, correct” indicates the
same structure *kwEn.157 Other examples of Canaanite and Egyptian rounded consonants appearing in Greek with the diphthong -oi- will be given in later chapters. Opposite examples occur. For instance, in Chapter 8, I will show that foi'bo" (H) does not derive from a hypothetical
**pwEb but from PÅ wŒb.158 Nevertheless, it is unlikely that *kwn or *kawn should have been rendered as koinós.
*GwEbla/Biblos* and *Gwe-De–me\vter. Other parallels between West Semitic and Greek are best explained by seeing them as loans into Greek that occurred when both languages still possessed labiovelars. Later, they went through the regular sound shifts undergone by Greek consonants. The famous Phoenician city known in Akkadian as Gublum is attested as early as the Third Millennium in the Egyptian Kbn. In the
Middle Kingdom it appeared with '(R5) the triliteral kÅp, as KÅpny.
The suggestion of a /Å/is reinforced by an Eighteenth-Dynasty form
written with a Ì kÅ-.159 KÅ- in this case possibly indicates a labiovelar,
as it will be argued below that Ì could represent /kw/.160 This, in turn
strengthens the hypothesis that the Semitic form contained a labiovelar. In fourteenth-century Canaanite, the city name was written Gubla and through normal sound changes became GEbál in Hebrew and Jebeil in Levantine Arabic. In 1950, the Semitist and ancient historian William
Albright proposed that Greeks had heard Gubla/um as *GwEbl or *Gwibl before the breakdown of the Greek labiovelars. As it is known that in most Greek
dialects gwi became bi, this would explain the puzzle of why the city name Gubla was rendered Bivblo" Bíblos or Buvblo" Byblos in Greek.161 I maintain that it would be easier to accept the transfer if Canaanite too



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 147
had possessed labiovelars and that the Greeks had actually heard *Gwibl.
Another example is the name Demeter Dhmhvter, De–me@!ter(H). Before coming to her, however, we should consider the word gh'(H) “earth” and its longer doublet gai'a(H). These two have no Indo-European etymologies and scholars cannot even see how the two can be related. In the middle of the twentieth century, the Semitist Marcel Cohen suggested that ge\ could be derived from the Ethiopian ge “land, country.”162 I proposed this, independently in Volume 1, linking gaîa to the Canaanite
full form gay ́> “wide valley” and ge\ to its construct form gê>, thus explaining the Greek doublet.163 As Saul Levin pointed out thirty years
ago, the vocalization of gay ́> is unique in Canaanite.164 In his Dictionnaire
des racines Sémitiques, David Cohen subsumed it under a root ÷gww/>, as
in the Arabic gi=wa\>. The possibility that this derived from *gwe is increased by another proposal, of Marcel Cohen, that the common south
Ethiopic title gweta (gwäyta in the northern Tigrinya) “master, landlord” derived from *gwe “land” with the personal suffix -ta.165 Although well established in Homer, neither gaîa, which is far more frequently used in the epics, nor ge\ has so far been attested in Linear B. The same is true of the name Demeter. Nevertheless, the divine name appears to be very old. Neither ancient nor modern scholars have any
difficulty with the second portion of her name -me!–ter “mother.” The problem has been the initial De–-, although there is general agreement that it means “earth.” The standard word for that, however, is ge\. The first vowel in the name is confusing in that, while the Dorian dialects
have the expected Da–ma—vter, the Aeolic is Dwma–vter. Paul Kretschmer accepted the theory of the scholiasts that da- was simply an ancient name for “earth.”166 Chantraine objects that the word does not exist except as an exclamation. Another explanation would be to derive it from the Semitic. If the
root ÷gww/> was originally *gwe in West Semitic it would have become *de in Greek through the regular pattern of the breakdown of labiovelars. The Dorian Da–ma–ter complicates the equation but, as it is not confirmed in Linear B, it could be a back formation. The Do–ma–ter in the generally
conservative Aeolic could have been affected by the rounded *gwe. While the phonetic relationship could well be stronger, the semantics are perfect. The cases of Byblos and Demeter provide additional evidence to back the hypothesis that labiovelars can be safely reconstructed for ProtoSemitic. They undoubtedly existed in Proto-Afroasiatic and are present



148 BLACK ATHENA
to this day in Ethiopic Semitic. The evidence from Greek, however, strengthens the case for their having survived in Asiatic Semitic at least into the Second Millennium.167
Labiovelars in Egyptian? Could labiovelars have existed in Egyptian? Against such an idea is the lack of any obvious Coptic or Greek attestation of them, and the complete absence of any Egyptological consideration of the possibility. Furthermore, the presence of labiovelars in Semitic does not necessarily imply that they existed in Egyptian, which was so much less archaic. On the other hand, Proto-Afroasiatic doubtlessly possessed labiovelars. Furthermore, a number of Babylonian transcriptions of Egyptian can be interpreted in this way and the vocalization -Coi C- in Coptic and Greek can be interpreted as a rendition of round
ing just as mwa is spelled moi and kwã, coin in French. Finally, evidence is
given later in this chapter of rounded sw and mw in Egyptian. These arguments justify consideration of the possibility of labiovelars
and the place to begin is the sign Ì, transcribed kÅ. The semantics of
the conventionally written ka and the possibility that kÅ was borrowed
into Greek as ke*@r will be discussed below in Chapter 10.168 Here we merely
consider the phonetic value of Ì within Egyptian.
The vocalization of this sign at various periods is both complex and controversial. The German scholars Gerhard Fecht and Jürgen Osing maintained that Koiahk and Kiahk (S) Khoiak (B) and Kaiak (A), the Coptic forms of the festival named kÅ h≥r kÅ in Egyptian, indicated a stress on the second syllable and a reconstructed *kaÅ.169 Werner Vycichl disagreed. He argued that they neglected “no less than four arguments”:
(1) the value of Ì in the syllabic orthography as ku; (2) the absence of
palatalization, which would have taken place with *kaÅ; (3) the maintenance of the vowel in the first syllable; and (4) the aspiration of the Bohairic form. In addition to these arguments, Vycichl refers to the Middle Babylonian (second half of the Second Millennium) transcriptions of TÅb n kÅ “gold or silver vase,” as zabnakuu and H≥t kÅ Pth≥ “Memphis” rendered H≥ikuuptaah.° Note the double /u/ in both cases.170 Vycichl could have strengthened his argument by mentioning the Linear B form, A3kupitijo, and the alphabetic Aijguvptio". Nevertheless, the authorita
tive Fecht and Osing clearly had grounds, from the spelling of Koiak etc., to justify the presence of an /a/. I believe that a solution can be found in the reconstruction of an origi
nal vocalization *kw-(a)). In another entry, Vycichl writes, “At the time in



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 149
question, [The Late Ethiopian period, seventh century BCE] Ì is not ka,
but an unpalatalized k close to or identical to  ̊ [q] in opposition to the
simple k k [which was] lightly palatalized in most cases.”171 Such a
definition would fit kw- perfectly. This passage was written in the lemma to the Coptic word kelol–or kulol–“vessel for water,” with another spelling “cavern, hollow place,” both derived from qrr. The alternation of vowels
suggests that here we might be dealing with an original *qwe-lol.–Thus, it
is possible that as the cosonantal /Å/ was lost Ì was used not merely to
transcribe foreign names as ku but also for Semitic words introduced into Egyptian.172
The suggestion that Ì was used to represent kw- as well as ku is
strengthened by three phenomena: first, an alternation of ku with ka in the group script; second, a Canaanite rendition of ku as ka or qa; and third, words rendered in the group script as ku appearing as ka in Coptic. As examples of the first type, there are the alternatives kurti/karati “whip,” kurakura/karakara “couch” and kumaru/kamaru “dancer,” and possibly the
Hebrew komer “pagan priest,” further evidence of an original *kwamer. The second phenomenon is represented by kumasa “cowardice,” which James Hoch links to the Mishnaic kåmasv“wilt, fade” and certain Arabic stems of the verb kamasa.173 Then there is Kur>ata “caged.” Hoch reconstructs this word as a feminine passive participle *kalu> ata as the biblical Hebrew kålû > “imprisoned.” Finally, there is kurata which Hoch derives from *karata “slaughter or sword.”174 He links this derivation to the common Semitic root ÷krt and the Hebrew kårat. As an example of the third, there is the Coptic kaji “small bucket” derived a Semitic borrowing kada
(read kusa in group script). C ̈erny relates this to the Aramiac kûza>–“small jug.” Against this Leslau believes the Aramaic and similar Arabic forms to be loans from Iranian.175
The hypothesis that signs generally read ka- could also be read kw- is
strengthened by a variant spelling of the city name Byblos/Gubla/ *Gwibl
discussed above. However, the value of Ì as kw-a- was not restricted to
Semitic names and loans. The Coptic word kelol\ or kulol\ has been men
tioned above. There is also the ancient word related to kÅ, kÅ Ì, written
with a bull and a phallus, “bull” was vocalized ko in Old Coptic and ka
and kai- in Greek transcriptions, indicating an earlier *kwa, and of course
kÅ Ì itself.
All in all, it seems likely that Egyptian contained labiovelars even though the writing system was not normally able to express them.



150 BLACK ATHENA
Other rounded consonants. Neither Bomhard nor Orel and Stolbova reconstruct rounded sibilants for Proto-Afroasiatic. Equally, they are not recorded in Ethiopic Semitic where rounding is such a common feature of other phonemes. On the other hand, following Diakonoff ’s
scheme of the two vowels /a/ and /E/ with sonants, one might expect sibilants and they are attested in South Cushitic.176 Furthermore, the chart of third-person pronouns, parallel to the one for the second person
given above, strongly suggests that a rounded sw also existed in Asiatic Semitic: Masculine Feminine Nom. Acc. Obl. Nom. Acc. Obl.
Egyptian177 swt(ind) Eblaite178 suwa Assyrian179 sût suâsu sit Akkadian180 sû suatì suâsim si siâtì siâsim Qatabanian swt sit Sabaean hwt hyt Arabic huwa hiya Ge’ez wE>Etu yE>Etu Ez±a (W. Gurage) acc. Hetzron181 hwEt hyEt acc. Leslau182 xut xi;t
Other evidence comes from Egyptian and Akkadian transcriptions of Canaanite words: *tawbib “to draw back” as sa-wa bi-bi; swl “skirt, for
horse?” s-wa-r and *so>–ibta “vessel,” as su5-wi2-b-ti in Egyptian and su-i
ib-da in Akkadian.183 The proposal is strengthened by the fact that the thirtieth sign in the Ugaritic alphabet, conventionally named zu and tran
scribed as s', was pronounced either as /sw/ or su.184 We are on safer ground when considering rounded labials. These are abundantly attested in Afroasiatic and other African languages. Interestingly, however, they have a relatively low profile in Omotic, Beja and Cushitic. This makes their strong presence in Ethiopic Semitic less likely to be an innovation than the preservation of a Proto-Semitic feature. For
instance, the widespread Gurage form bwEr “main, important man” appears in the Akkadian b>6r which the semitist I. J. Gelb reconstructed as
buar–um “strong.” However, for B>6s with an identical structure, Gelb pos
ited bâs+um “ashamed.” In this case, too, the initial would appear to be a



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 151
rounded *bw-. The Canaanite root is ÷bws=“shame” and, despite difficulties with the final sibilant, this would seem to be connected to the
general Gurage bwäs “moldy, one who does not keep himself clean, one who does not do things well.” There is a common Semitic root ÷bzz
“seize, rape, pillage.” Bwäz( ̈z) ̈ä is the name of the terrifying but fertilizing deity personifying thunder and lightning for the remaining pagan Gurage, who have not been converted to Islam or Christianity. Houses are protected from him by planting a stick from a tree struck by lightning in front of the gate.185 It is, therefore, interesting to note that one of the pillars erected in front of the Jerusalem temple (and presumably those in front of other Canaanite temples) was named BoŒaz.186
Finally, there is the form mwätä found in the Gurage languages of Gogot and Soddo and belonging to the Afroasiatic root that Orel and Stolbova reconstruct as *mawut “to die.” This form could well be reflected in the alternation between the general Asiatic Semitic ÷mwt and the Akkadian mâtu. I. J. Gelb reconstructed the verb as muat–um.187 Stronger evidence of the survival of rounded /m/ in Egyptian comes from the Akkadian transcription of the culturally central Egyptian concept of
mÅŒt as mua. (The loan of mÅŒt into Greek as moìra will be discussed in Chapter 10 below.188) Another rounded labial can be seen in Gardiner’s
plausible reconstruction of the root dpt “boat” as dapwat.189 In Ethiopic Semitic and many other languages there is a frequent
alternation Cwa/Co. Thus, it is possible that the so-called Canaanite shift, a–>o–, which affected both Canaanite and Egyptian near the end of the Second Millennium, was stimulated by the breakdown of the rounded consonants, which by analogy pulled unrounded syllables with them.190 It is probable that labiovelars and rounded labials existed in Asiatic Semitic and Egyptian well into the Second Millennium but that they broke down later. The question remains how this breakdown related to the one that took place in Greek in the same millennium.
14B. THE BREAKDOWN OF GREEK LABIOVELARS, 2. That *Gwibla and
Demeter were introduced into Greek before the breakdown of labiovelars and gai'a and gh' after, tells us nothing about the dates of each shift. Two clues, however, indicate an earlier breakdown in Greek. The first of these comes from the name Guvh" the mythological name of a son of Ouranos and Gaia.191 The term guhv" which was glossed by the lexicographer Hesykhios in the fifth century CE as “measure of land” or “the



152 BLACK ATHENA
land itself.” Chantraine links this to guhvgy:e\a curved piece of wood in the plow, in the sense of “plowland.” However, gy:e\s could also be a loan
from the Canaanite *gwe when the labiovelar was still retained in that language but had already been lost in Greek. Or it could be the result of confusion of the two sources. Similarly, the Greek guvalon, “hollow,” sometimes describing a vase, came from the Semitic root ÷gwl “round
hole,” which can be rendered with a gw- in South Ethiopic Semitic. After the breakdown of the West Semitic labiovelars, the Canaanite gullåh was borrowed again as gwlevo" “hole, lair,” gau`lo" “Phoenician ship,” gaulov" “bucket” and gauliv" “oil lamp.”192 The dates of the Greek breakdown will be raised again in Chapter 9 in the discussion of the word basileus. All that will be said at this point is that the Greek Shift, which had nothing to do with the earlier shift in the satem languages, can be dated, using the arguments set out for subheadings 11 and 12 above, to the period 1600–1300 BCE. The evidence from Semitic loans suggest that there was a period after the Greek loss but before the Canaanite one. Since labiovelars do not appear to be present in Iron Age Phoenicia, the date of the Greek breakdown probably comes at the beginning of the range suggested. The date of the breakdown will be discussed further in Chapter 9.193 As in the previous two cases, the Hellenic and Semitic shifts differed greatly from the Egyptian. Like the Indo-Aryan, Armenian, Albanian and Balto-Slavic satem languages, the Hellenic and Semitic simply
delabialized kw>k.194 In Greek /kw/ broke down in various ways, most commonly into /p/ before /a/and /o/; /k/ before /u/; and /t/ before
/e/ and /i/. It seems in fact to have been closer to Lydian, where /kw/ universally went to /p/, and Lycian, where the resulting consonants appear to have been t and k.195 An Aegean-Anatolian isogloss seems to be
formed. However the possibility that /kw/ sometimes became /p/ in Semitic and the great variations among Greek dialects, however, may lessen its significance. There is, however, a much more serious objection to imposing a simpleminded formula based on the Ancient Model: that the Greek labiovelars broke down because the Afroasiatic conquerors were losing theirs. As
with the shift ty to s, it probably took place in the Aegean before it did in Canaan. Thus, one would have to posit the more complicated hypothesis that the general linguistic confusion of seventeenth-century BCE Greece led to the system’s collapse there. Meanwhile, in the Levant the chaos of the invasion of the Sea Peoples, mostly Greek and Anatolian



[CH. 5] GREEK PHONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS 153
speakers who had lost their labiovelars, caused the breakdown in Canaanite.
15. THE SHIFT FROM /u/ TO /ü/. This shift appears to have taken place somewhat later than the others and, like that from /a–/ to /e–/ (no. 12), it was initially restricted to East Ionic and Attic and not found in other dialects until Hellenistic times. The usual period given for this shift is the seventh or sixth century BCE.196 Scholars proposing this dating, however, are limited by the conventional dating of the introduction of the alphabet to the eighth century because the alphabetic Greek u originally represented /u/ before the change to /ü/. If, however, as I and others have argued, the date of the introduction of the alphabet is raised to the Second Millennium, this limit no longer applies. In 1940 Edgar Sturtevant suggested that the shift /u/>/ü/ could have been much earlier.197 Phoenician, though not Hebrew, also went through a similar shift /u/ >/ü/. This seems to have been a development of a long-term “chain shift” beginning with the Canaanite shift accented long /a–v/ > /o–v/. A later Phoenician shift went from stressed /á/ >/o/ (very possibly through /å/, qåmås≥, phonetic /O/). The resulting /o/ did not merge with the one derived from the Canaanite shift. The letter was then “pushed” or “dragged” to /u/. This movement, in turn, forced the original Semitic /u/ to become /ü/.198 The question remains whether the Semitic and Greek shifts /u/>/ü/ could be related. The type of chain shift in which back vowels move to the front is extremely common and has been found in a large number of Indo-European languages. Thus, the developments in Phoenician and East Ionic could well have been independent. The divergent shifts /a–v/ > /o–v/ and a>h, referred to above (no. 12), indicate an Anatolian-Greek axis as opposed to an Egypto-Canaanite one. They correspond politically to the Egyptian and Hittite spheres of influence in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries. Phoenician-East Ionic linguistic contact would fit the period after the crisis of the Sea Peoples at the end of the thirteenth century, but before the Dorian domination of the southeast Aegean, in the tenth and ninth, that is to say in the twelfth and eleventh centuries when speakers of East Ionic and Phoenician were in close contact. If one can make the connection, it would seem more likely that the Phoenician shift /u/>/ü/, which was part of the larger chain sketched above, was the earlier and initiating change.



154 BLACK ATHENA
CONCLUSION
The phonological changes that took place between the disintegration of Indo-European and the earliest attestations of Greek cannot be the results of any single cause. The loss of laryngeals and the shift from emphatic to voiced stops occur in many other branches of Indo-European and must be explained in terms of internal developments. The split and merger of stops and aspirates is a peculiarity of Greek. Most of the remaining shifts occurred in neighboring languages and appear to have been the result of areal developments. Many of these—including the weakening of /s/, the shift from y>a and the loss of final -t—are frequent in languages throughout the world and too much significance can
not be placed on them. Some, like the shift from ty>s and the breakdown of labiovelars, may have taken place earlier in Greek than in Afroasiatic. Furthermore, the replacement of -m by -n and the Ionian shift from a–>epoint to Anatolian rather than Egyptian or southwest Asian influences. Apart from the dialect shift /u/>/ü/, the only phonological features of Greek that can be specifically linked to Afroasiatic is the frequency of prothetic vowels and this development is more properly seen as lexical.



[CH. 6] MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS 155
T
his chapter is concerned with the middle of the spectrum of changes expected in a language that has experienced substantial, but not overwhelming, influence from one or more other languages. In Chapter 5 we saw how insignificant outside influence was on Greek phonology. From Chapter 7 on, we shall see the massive influx of Afroasiatic words and names into the Greek vocabulary. In this chapter, we shall see a few instances of morphological forms taken from Semitic or Egyptian and rather more syntactical changes often brought about by lexical borrowings.
MORPHOLOGY
1. Loss of nominal cases
The drastic loss of cases in early Greek has been mentioned. In Armenian the opposite occurred probably because of the high level of inflection in the non–Indo-European languages surrounding its later home. Early Anatolian languages, by contrast, lacked dative-locative cases and the full nominal system found in Indo-European proper.1 Thus, an IndoHittite “pre-Hellenic” substrate might have exerted pressure on Greek to lose cases. Just as likely, however, the influence could have come from Afroasiatic. In fact, this possibility is more likely because during the Second

MEDITERRANEAN CONTEXT
Part 2, Morphological and Syntactical Developments
CHAPTER 6



156 BLACK ATHENA
Millennium Canaanite, which had started with only three nominal cases, was generally reduced to one. This process seems to have been completed in the construct state by the fourteenth century and some time later in the absolute.2 More likely this change was the result of Egyptian influence. In Egyptian case had no markers, with the possible exception of the nominative, since writing began in the Fourth Millennium. Thus the breakdown of the Greek declension can be attributed to either substrate or areal influences or both.
2. The Greek oblique duals -oiin and -aiin
The Oxford linguist L. R. Palmer, in his authoritative The Greek Language, wrote, “The Greek-oiin, has no parallel elsewhere [in Indo-European].”3 Saul Levin easily explains this. He has clearly demonstrated that the genitive and dative dual suffix -oiin, common in Homeric Greek, although not attested in Linear B, came from the Canaanite dual accusative and genitive *-ayim. Although the Ugaritic accusative-genitive suffix was -e–m, the Arabic is -ayni and the Hebrew and presumably Canaanite -ayim, used for all cases, is generally thought to have originated from the oblique ending.4 The difference between the final mimation in Canaanite and the nunation in Greek can be explained in one or two ways. On the one hand, the original form could have been the final -n in the dual. This form is universal in Asiatic Semitic; Canaanite was the only exception. If this were the case, the copying into Greek took place before the change in the Levant.5 On the other hand, perhaps Greek simply did not tolerate final -m. It is striking that not only does the Greek -oiin have no parallels in any other Indo-European language but only one other instance of confusion of the two cases occurs in the family—the singular of nouns, not pronouns, in Armenian. Thus, Professor Levin’s claim would seem to be irrefutable.
3. -qen
This proposed borrowing is less secure than the others. In Greek the adverbial suffix-qen denotes motion from a place. Although it is common in Homer, it has no analogy in any other Indo-European language.6 Two possible Egyptian sources exist. The first is the Middle Egyptian interrogative, tn “where?” or “whence?” The second comes from the fact that in the eighth century BCE, both hieroglyphics and Demotic have



[CH. 6] MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS 157
the forms n tÅy-n “starting from” written later in Coptic as jin Sahidic(S) and isjen Bohairic (B).7 Although the semantic and phonetic fits are excellent, a serious syntactic problem arises in that there seems to be no instance of the word’s having been affixed to a noun. Nevertheless, in the absence on an Indo-European etymology, an Egyptian origin should be entertained as a genuine possibility.
4. -ευς
The problem of the origin of the suffix-ευς the one or the man who” is hotly debated. The existence of such words as hippeús “horseman” based on híppos, the Greek word of Indo-European origin, shows that the suffix was active during the Mycenaean period. On the other hand, the classicist Joachim Schindler admits both that there are no direct parallels to it in the rest of Indo-European and that most of the stems to which it is attached are non–Indo-European. Nevertheless, he insists that the suffix is Indo-European.8 Faced with the same problems, Szemerényi and Perpillou see the suffix as an innovation within Greek.9 Such an innovation can easily be explained if it is seen as a loan from the suffix -w found on Egyptian participles and “relative forms,” which when standing as nouns mean “the one” or “ones who.”10 As mentioned in Chapter 5, one aspect of the general Egyptian vowel shift in the thirteenth century BCE was from long stressed /u:/ˇ to /e:/ˇ.11 In 1923 William Albright suggested that this shift went through a stage */eu/.12 Thus, on both the semantic and the phonetic grounds the evidence for such a borrowing is very strong.
SYNTAX
If relatively few phonological or morphological developments in Greek can be attributed to Afroasiatic influences, more extensive changes from Afroasiatic can be found in syntax or, rather, in some lexical items central to the patterns of Greek syntax.
1. Sources of some common Greek conjunctions, adverbs and particles
Three of the most common words in Greek are ge(vH), garv(H) and kai.v Neither kai nor ge has an Indo-European etymology and gavr is derived



158 BLACK ATHENA
by Chantraine from gev+ a[ra.13 As conjunctions neither kaí generally translated as “and” nor gár “in fact, indeed, for” can stand at the beginning of a clause and gár “is usually placed after the first word in its clause.”14 As a postpositive and enclitic particle ge intensifies or restricts the noun, phrase or clause that comes before it. Middle Egyptian has a frequent enclitic gr, later grt, emphasizing the preceding word. It is often not translated by Egyptologists but sometimes is rendered as “now, also.”15 Even though both the Greek and the Egyptian clusters have wide and vague semantic ranges, their ranges are remarkably similar in terms of both semantics and syntax. Phonetically, the correspondence between gr and grt and gár is excellent. That between
the Egyptian words and gevis strengthened by the Sahidic(S) Coptic rendering of grt as c=e or Bohairic (B) as je. Thus at least three of the key structural elements in Greek syntax appear to have derived from different stages of the Egyptian language. Kai (H) “and” is one of the most frequent words in Greek, and yet according to Chantraine its etymology is “unknown.” Frisk favors a “preGreek” origin. The Egyptian word kyy “other” is not a full adjective but only an “apparent” one in that it was originally a noun. Therefore, as a noun in apposition it preceded the noun rather than following it as was normal for qualifying adjectives. In Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic kyy developed later meanings of “also, again.” Sethe reconstructed the masculine form as *ke–je.16 As a proclitic it was pronounced ke- in most Coptic dialects and kai- in Lycopolitan (L) in Middle Egypt. The frequent particle oûn (H) or o–n (H) has a wide and ill-defined semantic range in Greek. It can be used to confirm statements or to point back to something stated earlier or already known. It is often combined with other particles or conjunctions, including de (H), a[lla (H), gár or gé to mean “in fact, at all events, even if.” It is also used to continue topics or to resume those that have been interrupted. Syntactically, it is postpositive, appearing after the statement to which it refers. Attempts have been made to derive it from the Greek root wjn “to be” found in the participle o{nt- and the derived form o]nt- “truly.” Chantraine, however, objects to this etymology because of “insurmountable difficulties” and states that the origin of oûn is “unknown.” In Late Egyptian there is a particle Œn that derives from the verb Œnn “to turn around.” On its own, Œn, which was rendered as on in Coptic, means “again” or “already.” The notion of repetition as emphasis is found in many languages and specifically in earlier Egyptian. There the



[CH. 6] MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS 159
dual suffix -wy is attached to a modifier in such sentences as bˆnwy nˆ “how bad things are for me.” In Late Egyptian and Coptic Œn /on was usually postpositive. The most likely solution to this tangle is that the Greek oûn derived from three sources: First, it came from Œn /on. This derivation could explain its emphatic and resumptive uses. Oûn was also influenced semantically by the Greek on–to give it the sense of “in fact, truly.” The Egyptian word for “ to be,” however, was also wn /un. Wn /un by itself cannot be the origin of oûn because, unlike Œn /on, it always appears before the topic. The striking similarity between the Egyptian wn /un “to be, there is/are” and the Greek on–and ónt- “to be” appears to be a coincidence. The parallel with the two Egyptian forms Œn/on may have led to the psilosis or dropping of the initial /h/ from o:ˇn that one would expect in relation to other Indo-European words. This would explain Chantraine’s problems with the phonetics. The later philosophical sense of o[nto" “substance, reality” was almost certainly influenced by the remarkable coincidence of the Egyptian wn and wn mÅŒ “reality” with the Indo-European form.
2. Autjo"v
Autós (H) “the same, him, it” substitutes for the oblique cases of the thirdperson singular in Greek. The lexicographer of Greek, A. J. Van Windekens writes in the lemma concerned with this form, “one finds oneself in front of a word which has not received a plausible explanation.” He cites a number of scholars to this effect.17 Van Windekens then proposes a derivation from the Indo-European *atma “wind, breath, soul, self.” “Self ” is not a meaning given to it by other Indo-Europeanists.18 This etymology is as shaky in its semantics as it is in its phonetics. In this case, too, one should consider the possibility of an Afroasiatic origin. Saul Levin has pointed out that the Hebrew ’ ot\ô “him, it”:
has no clear Semitic cognates nor has the Greek ajutovin IE apart from Phrygian (which is very meagerly attested). But this Hebrew and this Greek pronoun have a lot in common with each other. Not only are they close in sound, but to a considerable extent they function the same—so much so that in the Septuagint the Greek word serves readily as just the right translation for the Hebrew.19
Naturally, Saul Levin points out that in both languages the ending is modified for gender: the Greek masculine autós and feminine aute–and



160 BLACK ATHENA
the Hebrew feminine ’ ot\åh. He sees ’ ot\ô and the Greek neuter autó as the basic forms. In considering the likely Indo-Europeanists’ objection to any connection between the two words (on the grounds that the auto must originally have ended in -od from a common Indo-European neuter ending in -d), he finds it more likely that a borrowing from the Canaanite masculine ’ot\ô would be seen as a Greek neuter by analogies to other Greek forms with clear Indo-European etymologies, such as to “that” and allo “other.”20 Levin also considers the Greek system houtos, neuter touto “this.” His assessment of the standard etymologies is scathing: “They note the lack of IE cognates but still posit a sort of compounding of a sequence of IE morphemes whose semantic vagueness would permit nearly any possibility.” Levin suggests instead that “all the other Greek case-forms would have arisen from the absorption of aujtov/aujtov"/aujthvinto the Greek morphological system.”21
3. The development of the Greek definite article22
One of the striking late features found in both Canaanite and Greek is the definite article “the.” Definite articles are present in most European languages, as well as in Hebrew and Arabic. From the point of view of the thousands of languages that exist or have existed in the world, however, such articles are restricted to these Indo-European and Afroasiatic languages. In fact, all definite articles in the two families can be attributed to a single innovation. Ancient Egyptian, like nearly all of the world’s languages, had demonstrative adjectives of the type found in the English “this, that, these, those”: pn, tn and nn n(y) and pf, tf, and nf n(y) (the masculine, feminine and plural forms). These words were placed after the noun that they modified. During the Middle Kingdom from the twentieth to the eighteenth centuries BCE the Upper Egyptian dialect of Thebes developed the reduced forms pÅ, tÅ and nÅ n(y) which were placed before the noun and were used with the weakened sense of “the.”23 Middle Egyptian, the spoken language of the Late Old Kingdom and the Middle Kingdom remained the “classical” written language of Egypt for two thousand years. With the triumph of the Eighteenth Dynasty from Thebes, however, Southern Egyptian became the standard spoken language of the New Kingdom.24 The definite article was a leading char

acteristic of the new speech. From Southern Egyptian the definite article was adopted, along with the other linguistic modifications, into Canaanite. Ugaritic, written and probably conventionalized around the middle of the Second Millennium BCE in the north of the Levant, shows no trace of definite articles. Their relatively early presence in Canaanite suggests that they were adopted, in the Egyptian sphere of influence in the southern Levant, after the conquests of Tuthmosis III in the fifteenth century BCE. The absence of the article in biblical (as opposed to later Hebrew) and early Greek verse could be explained by the demands of the literary form and as archaic. Poetry in Arabic or later European languages, however, does not appear to have had any problem with definite or indefinite articles. More than likely they were absent from Hebrew and Greek verse because verse forms had been established before the introduction of the article. As in Late Egyptian, the Canaanite definite article developed from the “near” demonstrative ha, presumably from an earlier sa, as a calque from, or analogous to, the Egyptian pÅ and tÅ. Saul Levin has made a valiant attempt to link the /t/ in the oblique forms of the Greek article to tÅ.25 This seems to me unlikely because, first, the initial t- in the Greek oblique terms can be explained in terms of Indo-European and, second, because evidence from Coptic and loans in Greek suggests that the masculine pÅ tended to replace the feminine tÅ. Saul Levin, has long seen a close relationship between the Greek and the Hebrew definite articles and their ultimate derivation from Egyptian. He was the first to point out that Canaanite and Greek are unique in applying the definite article to both the noun and its modifier.26 Thus, in Hebrew one finds sequences like hå<îs hat≥t≥ôb literally “the man the good” i.e. “the good man.” This special characteristic also exists in Greek, as in ho ánthrop–os ho agathós, which indicates that Greek did not take the form directly from Egypt but from Canaan or, more specifically, from Phoenicia. No doubt this loan ties Canaanite and Greek together in a way they do not share with Late Egyptian. Levin now maintains that the definite article “spread from Egyptian to Greek and then from Greek to a Semitic language in the neighbourhood of Egypt.” The essential basis for this, as he admits, “round-about” scheme, is that “within the Semitic languages, no demonstrative pronoun is known from which such a prefix could readily have been developed.”27 This last statement is puzzling because the conventional view is, as the twentieth-century linguist and



162 BLACK ATHENA
semitist, Zellig Harris described Phoenician, “as throughout Semitic, the pronouns of the third person, which were originally demonstratives, may be used with demonstrative force: ha> “that” and hmt “those.”28 Later writers have been more specific: “Distant demonstratives are identical with the third-person personal pronoun: h ‘that’ and hmt ‘those.’”29 In the earliest Hebrew prose one finds a definite article ha (and doubling of the initial consonant) placed in front of nouns instead of after them in the position of the demonstrative adjectives.30 Other Semitic languages, such as Aramaic and Arabic, also developed definite articles from demonstratives. Arabic followed Canaanite in placing them before the noun but Aramaic placed them after it. All in all, no good reason exists to deny the geographically and historically sensible route: the definite article spread by calquing from Egypt to Canaan and on to Greece. Latin has no definite article but all of its descendants, the Romance languages, do, presumably as the result of calquing from languages that did possess them. In the eastern provinces of the empire Greek and Aramaic would have provided the article. Punic, the form of Phoenician spoken in Rome’s great rival Carthage and many other cities in the western Mediterranean, could have supplied the article to other daughter languages. Thus, Portuguese uses o- and a- from the Latin hoc and haec, while the other Romance languages use forms like il, el, la, le derived from the Latin ille, illa “that” or “yon.” Ille itself presumably comes, through Punic, from the demonstrative >el\leh found throughout Semitic.31 It was also used to form the definite article >al in Arabic. This calque explains the remarkable similarity between the Arabic and Spanish words for “the”: >al and el. During the first centuries CE, the definite article spread north and east into the Germanic languages.32 Once again the spread was through calquing. Although the historical process is complicated in English, there is no doubt that “the” is a modified form of “that.” The only marked division among the Germanic languages is found in the Scandinavian languages, which like Aramaic, Albanian, Bulgarian and Romanian put the article after the noun rather than before it. Some Western Slav languages adopted the definite article, but its advance stopped short of Russian which, like Latin, does without. The whole process, lasting more than three thousand years, can be traced back to Upper Egypt during the Middle Kingdom. The Greek article was calqued from Canaanite well after the language’s initial development. In the Iliad and the Odyssey what later became the



[CH. 6] MORPHOLOGICAL AND SYNTACTICAL DEVELOPMENTS 163
article largely retained its demonstrative force. As Meillet and others have shown, however, sometimes the function of ho, he,\ to was virtually that of an article. Meillet plausibly suggests that the words were already beginning to be used as articles when the epics were composed following ancient formulae. This suggestion places a lower limit for the development of the article in the tenth, ninth or eighth centuries, whenever one cares to date Homer. Accepting the mainstream of ancient scholarship, I put this before 800 BCE.33 An upper limit is indicated by the fact that the article is barely attested in Cypriot and Pamphylian Greek, spoken in regions settled around 1200 BCE and more or less isolated from other Greeks after about a century.34 Thus, either these traces filtered through in later times or the change was forming in the thirteenth century BCE. If one accepts the hypothesis of Phoenician influence proposed here, nonlinguistic evidence would suggest the tenth and ninth centuries, the period of Phoenician dominance in the East Mediterranean during which the polis and “slave society” seem to have been introduced from the Levant to the Aegean.35 It would seem safer, however, not to narrow the four hundred year span from circa 1250–850 BCE. The relatively late emergence of the Greek definite article cannot be attributed to substrate or genetic influence. Indeed there is no trace of it in the neighboring Indo-European languages, Italic and Armenian. Thus either its development was independent or the result of Phoenician, hence ultimately Egyptian, influence. Although the Greek definite article, like the Canaanite forms, was created from native demonstratives, the Greek nominative forms ho and he\are remarkably coincident with the Canaanite ha. This coincidence would seem to be the result of three factors: the existence of a demonstrative stem s- in Nostratic, the areal shift s>h which affected both languages and direct influence from Canaanite to Greek.36
SUMMARY ON SYNTACTICAL CHANGES
The features discussed here appear to have come from different quarters at different periods. Although gé, gár and oûn appear to be well integrated into the language of Hesiod and Homer, so far as we can tell, they were not into Mycenaean. Since they have no Indo-European etymologies, they appear to be copies made in the Late Bronze Age from Egyptian. Archaeological and documentary evidence makes such intimate linguistic contact very probable during this period. Although it is not attested



164 BLACK ATHENA
in Linear B, autós too was deeply rooted in Homer and must have been introduced by the late Second Millennium. By contrast, the definite article was only beginning to appear by the time of epic poetry and would seem likely to have been introduced around the beginning of the First Millennium, when we know that there were close connections between Phoenicia and the Aegean.
CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I hope I have shown the usefulness of not limiting approaches to the development of Greek or, for that matter, any other language exclusively to genetic terms. Furthermore, the investigation of loans from outside, and from very different language families, should not be restricted to obvious exotics. Other languages can have much deeper and wider effects. True, looking at Greek in an East Mediterranean context does not tell us much about its phonological development. Nevertheless, the failure of Indo-Europeanists—with the notable exception of Oswald Szemerényi—to make the investigation indicates the strength of the bondage of their intellectual tradition. When it comes to morphology and syntax, they have missed the important insights provided by such scholars as Saul Levin. In following chapters we will turn to lexicon, an aspect of Greek that is incomprehensible without a constant awareness of surrounding languages in general and West Semitic and Ancient Egyptian in particular.

INTRODUCTION
T
his chapter is divided into three sections, each concerned with the possibility or probability of lexical borrowings from Afroasiatic languages into Greek. The first part examines the present state of the study of this subject. Second is a consideration of whether Greeks in the Archaic and Classical periods had any conception of having borrowed from other languages and the third studies the reliability of postulating Indo-European roots when the only attestations are from Greek and Armenian or Greek and Latin. Such similarities may, in fact, merely be the results of common borrowings from Semitic or Egyptian. Much of this last section is devoted to Semitic and Egyptian loans into Latin and illustrates the need to look beyond Indo-European especially when considering genetically irregular parallels among Greek, Armenian and Latin.
THE STUDY OF LEXICAL BORROWINGS
Phonological and morphological exchange between languages is rare and is generally believed to require long periods of intimate contact between speakers of the giving and receiving languages. The copying or “borrowing” of words is far more common and easily accomplished.
THE GREEK LANGUAGE IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN CONTEXT
Part 3, Lexicon
Note the case of Greek, which is thoroughly Indo-European in morphology and phonology, but largely non–IndoEuropean in lexicon, of English, which is largely nonGermanic in lexicon and of Turkish and Persian with their extraordinary proportions of Arabic loan words. I. J. Gelb, “Thoughts about Ibla”
CHAPTER 7



166 BLACK ATHENA
Loaning is one of the main vehicles by which phonological and morphological change can be brought about.1 Nevertheless, massive borrowing can take place without such changes. As we have seen in Chapter 5, no new sounds were introduced into Greek from Afroasiatic, although some previously existing ones, notably prothetic vowels, /b/, /p/, initial and medial s- and -ss-/-tt- became far more frequent as a result of contact with Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic.2 By analogy, it should be noted that no new phonemes came into English after the Norman Conquest even though most of the vocabulary was introduced from outside after 1066.3 Etymologists have great difficulty explaining the Greek lexicon. As mentioned in Chapter 5, Anna Morpurgo-Davies, professor of IndoEuropean at Oxford, put the proportion of Greek words with IndoEuropean etymologies at less than 40 percent.4 Thus, despite assiduous work by brilliant scholars, the situation around 2000 CE is still very much as Sir Henry Stuart Jones described it in 1925. In explaining why the new edition of Liddell and Scott’s standard and massive Greek-English Lexicon should, surprisingly, only include a “minimum” of “etymological information,” he wrote,
A glance at Boisacq’s Dictionnaire étymologicque de la langue grecque will show that the speculations of etymologists are rarely free from conjecture and the progress of comparative etymology since the days of George Curtius . . . has brought about the clearance of much rubbish but little solid construction.5
Much of this “rubbish” was of course Semitic, which could not be accepted within the Extreme Aryan Model. This model, as I have already argued, was established earlier in philology than in other disciplines. The process of “clearance” in Greek was very much that described for English by W. W. Skeat, the famous linguist and lexicographer when he wrote in 1891:
I have had much to unlearn, during the endevour to teach myself, owing to the extreme folly and badness of much of the English etymological literature current in my earlier days, that the avoidance of errors has been impossible . . . the playful days of Webster’s Dictionary when the derivation of native English words from Ethiopic and Coptic was a common thing.6
Skeat described his own purpose in the following way: “I have endevoured,



[CH. 7] LEXICON 167
where possible, to trace back words to their Aryan roots, by availing myself of the latest works upon comparative philology.”7 To return to the lack of progress: clearly linguists relying almost exclusively on Indo-European have reached a dead end. All they can do is to try to explain why the Greek lexicon cannot be explained. The nonIndo-European elements are simply written off as “pre-Hellenic” or from other lost languages.8 It is commonly asserted that these non-IndoEuropean elements are the herbs, shrubs and natural features of the new environment settled by the incoming northerners. It is certainly true that words like ma:raqon “fennel,” mi:nqh “mint” and nh¥soV “island” cannot be provided with plausible Indo-European etymologies.9 Emphasizing this type of example distorts the overall picture. As mentioned in Chapter 5, Morpurgo-Davies’s estimated Indo-European component of less than 40 percent of the total Greek vocabulary contrasts starkly with the 79 percent from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots found in the shorter Swadesh 100-word list of basic items.10 Thus in Greek the semantic areas for which an Indo-European vocabulary can be found are what might truly be called “basic”: nature, animals, parts of the body, family relations, personal and other pronouns, common verbs and adjectives. The vocabulary of higher culture—religion, abstraction, civic society, metal work and luxuries of all kinds—is non-Indo-European.11 The absence of high-culture terms is made more striking by the fact that some of this vocabulary existed in PIE. For instance, the Teutonic root *gulth “gold” is related to the Old Church Slavonic zlato and possibly to the Greek kho\r- “green.” The Greek word for “gold,” however, is crus|o:V—kuruso in Linear B—which is admitted to be from the Semitic: the Akkadian ∆ura\s≥u the Canaanite ha\rus≥ “gold.”12 Equally, the Sanskrit raj, the Latin rex and the Irish ri all mean “king” and come from a common Indo-European stem.13 In Greek the words are  ̧a[nax ̧wanaka in Linear B and basileuv", qasireu, both supposedly of pre-Hellenic origin. (For their Egyptian origins see below.14) In their semantic range, the non-Indo-European elements in Greek resemble the French and Latin words in English, the Arabic in Swahili and the Chinese in Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese. These parallels would tend to go against the explanatory principle of a conquest of nonIndo-European speakers by Proto-Greeks. On the other hand, in a smaller group of languages conquerors of “low” cultural level have conquered higher civilizations. In most of such cases the conquerors are culturally and linguistically absorbed. In at least two, however, Hungarian and



168 BLACK ATHENA
Turkish, the conquerors have kept their basic linguistic structure and basic vocabulary, while taking on the lexicon of higher culture from conquered or neighboring peoples. But both Hungarian and Turkish retained their military vocabulary or that of their previous overlords, the Khazars and the Mongols, respectively. This is not the case in Greek. Apart from some charioteering terms that have Indo-Iranian origins, most of the language of warfare—words for “sword,” “bow,” “arrow,” “shield,” “armor,” “camp,” “army,” battle” etc.—appear to be non-IndoEuropean. Thus, if Greek belongs to the Hungarian-Turkish minority of languages, as the Aryan Model requires, it is very different from these two in its military terminology and is almost certainly unique. If, on the other hand, the Revised Ancient Model is applied, Greek fits neatly into the larger group including English, Swahili, Vietnamese, Japanese, Old Javanese and many others.15 While the Aryan Model has not been tested lexically, because it is untestable, it is possible to falsify the Revised Ancient Model. We know a considerable amount about the languages spoken by Near Eastern neighbors of the Greeks and can test the model by studying these languages. The rest of the chapter will be devoted to this testing.
The state of Semitic etymologies for Greek words
Despite the dominance of the Extreme Aryan Model, nearly all scholars have admitted that some Phoenician loan words exist in Greek. Attempts to find these words, however, have suffered from three serious handicaps: First, for religious reasons, scholars have been reluctant to admit the obvious linguistic fact that Hebrew is a Canaanite dialect. Second, modern observers have reacted strongly against the Medieval and Renaissance belief that Hebrew was the language of the Tower of Babel and the ancestor of all other tongues. This reaction has maintained momentum throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with the rise and triumph of Indo-European philology and the Aryan Model. The passion still evoked can be seen in Ventris and Chadwick’s tone in a 1955 statement referring to “a long period of unprofitable speculation on the mutual relationship of languages in which Hebrew played a pernicious role.”16 Third, while tolerant, if not lax, in accepting a Phoenician origin for Greek words for trade goods, classical scholars have rigorously rejected



[CH. 7] LEXICON 169
any etymology that might challenge the Aryan Model. Thus, it has been relatively easy for scholars to admit such words as kumino in Linear B or kuvmi–non “cumin” or kito citwvn “dress” or ajrrabwvn (4) “deposit” as Phoenician. In general, however, many refuse to connect the Ugaritic bmt, Hebrew båmåh “high place” or “altar” to the Greek bwmov" (H) with the same meaning, or the Semitic ÷qds “holy” as the source of ku'do" (H) “divine power.”17 The zenith—or nadir—of the Extreme Aryan Model in lexicography began at the same time as the peak of antiSemitism in the 1930s but in this case continued until the 1960s. It was in the 1930s that the Indo-Europeanist Antoine Meillet wrote, “It was not the Phoenician civilisation that served as a model for the Greeks coming from the north: archaeology has proved it and one is not surprised to find only a tiny [infime] number of words borrowed from Phoenician.” He later wrote that “they certainly did not amount to ten.”18 This was the end of a long chain of “refinement” or limitation.
MICHEL MASSON’S SURVEY OF SCHOLARLY WORK ON THE TOPIC. In 1986,
Michel Masson, a scholar of a later generation, published an important article “A propos des critères permettant d’établir l’origine Semitiques de certains mots Grecs” [On the criteria permitting the establishment of Semitic origins for certain Greek words].19 This work included a persuasive history of the study of Semitic loans into Greek. He started with Heinrich Lewy’s Die semitischen Fremdwörter im Griechischen [Semitic loanwords in Greek] first published in 1895. Masson neglects English language sources and fails to mention Muss-Arnolt’s earlier scholarly work. But Masson rightly focuses on self-conscious tradition or succession from Lewy to Maria-Luisa Mayer’s Gli impresti semitici in Greco, which appeared as a book in 1960. He also includes Meillet’s pupil Emilia Masson who, in 1967, published her Recherches sur les plus anciens emprunts sémitiques en grec [Researches on the most ancient Semitic borrowings in Greek]. Emilia Masson was even more rigid than her predecessors in her insistence that only terms that did not offend the Aryan Model should be acknowledged. Thus the list was very largely restricted to luxuries: gold, clothes and above all spices.20 This extreme view became the basis for the acceptance of Semitic loans in Hjalmar Frisk’s Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch and Chantraine’s Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque.
Michel Masson describes the scholarly succession of Semitic loans as a series of filtrations. Lewy had proposed approximately 200 names and



170 BLACK ATHENA
400 words. Mayer reduced this to about a third of Lewy’s list. Emilia Masson filtered still further. None of them established rigorous criteria for their reductions.21 In attempting to re-establish Lewy’s scientific status, Michel Masson pointed out that the earlier scholar limited himself to concrete objects and grouped his proposals semantically. These limits set Lewy apart from the “confusionism” or shotgun approach of the earlier “pansemitists.” According to Masson, Lewy had three implicit criteria. These were:
1. He refused hypotheses of Semitic origin when a Indo-European origin was possible. 2. He tried to set out a coherent series of phonetic correspondences, although he did not rigorously stick to them. 3. He threw out of his list abstract or too broad-ranging nouns, adjectives and verbs.22
The first two criteria are unexceptionable, but Michel Masson approves of all three. While he believes that in some cases one can go beyond Lewy’s list he does not believe that one should abandon the third basic principle. Like Lewy, and naturally like the more restrictive scholars, he cannot break free from the Aryan Model and envisage fundamental contacts between West Semitic and Greek speakers. Thus, he is clearly quite right to claim at the end of his article, “In setting out these exigencies, we do not want to correct scholars like Chantraine, Frisk and E. Masson. It is their criteria that we have attempted to define and apply. We have only tried to further their research.”23 Interestingly, Michel Masson neglected the English language publications that had appeared in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These decades saw the beginning of the work of Michael Astour, John Pairman Brown. Saul Levin, and Oswald Szemerényi who, following the retreat of the Extreme Aryan Model and the discovery of Semitic loan words in the Linear B corpus, began to increase the number of recognized Semitic loans.24 They happily used Ugaritic, Hebrew and even Akkadian parallels. With the exception of Astour, however, they largely continued to work within the Aryan Model to the extent that they too have largely restricted their search for Semitic etymologies to nouns, mostly those obtainable by trade, or obviously exotic Greek words. Nevertheless, over the last forty years, these scholars have transformed the whole atmosphere of Greek lexicography.



[CH. 7] LEXICON 171
OTHER SEMITIC ETYMOLOGIES. While not inhibited by Lewy’s third criterion, in this book I am bound by a constraint that has not affected other scholars. I accept the hypothesis that the Philistines were chiefly Greek speaking.25 Thus, cognate terms in Greek and Hebrew may be the result of a Greek loan into later Canaanite rather than the other way around. Interestingly, however, an Egyptian origin is possible for the two bestknown examples of strikingly similar words in Canaanite and Greek. For instance, the word mEkeråh “a type of weapon” which is found as a hapax legamenon, a single instance in Genesis, could be a loan from the Greek mavcaira (H) “dagger,” as mEkeråh has no direct Semitic cognates.26 On the other hand, a root ÷mh°“match, fight” is well established in Afroasiatic and the Egyptian word with this sense mh°Å has a final -Å that would explain the /r/ in Hebrew and Greek.27 In Egyptian of the Ptolemaic period, there is even a form mh°ay “pierce with a spear.” Thus the least unlikely explanations of the undoubted relationship between mákhaíra and mEkeråh are either that it was borrowed into Greek from Egyptian and then taken from Greek into Canaanite or that Greek and Canaanite borrowed it separately from Egyptian. A parallel for this can be seen in the pair made up of the Greek levsch (H) and the Hebrew li s ̈kåh “chamber for drinking and relaxing.” As both words are isolates in their own language families, scholars have differed as to which language borrowed from the other.28 I believe that both came directly or indirectly from an unattested but perfectly possible Egyptian form *r-ˆsk “place for lingering.”29
A place of nether darkness. Another problem with discussing possible Semitic or Egyptian etymologies for Greek terms is when plausible sources for a word can be found in both Indo-European and Afroasiatic. The classic example of this situation is e]rebo" (H) “place of nether darkness, dusk.” Debates over the relative merits of the Semitic and Indo-European etymologies of erebos have carried on for well over a century.30 I follow the first tradition and my critics Jasanoff and Nussbaum follow the other. Jasanoff and Nussbaum derive erebos, from an Indo
European root *h1regwos [or, as most modern scholars would put it
*h1rekVwos] “darkness.” They establish this hypothetical root on the basis
of forms found in Sanskrit, Germanic and Armenian. The Armenian is most important because they see its form erek “evening” as providing evidence of a laryngeal consonant lost in other Indo-European languages and, therefore, explaining the prothetic e- in erebos. Other scholars do



172 BLACK ATHENA
not explain the parallel in the same way. James Clackson, in his recent The Linguistic Relationship between Armenian and Greek, denies that the two prothetic vowels are directly related, either as a preservation of a laryngeal or as a common innovation. He sees them simply as coming from an Anatolian [and Aegean?] tendency to avoid initial r-. Presumably because many Greek words of undoubted Indo-European origin begin with r-, Jasanoff and Nussbaum prefer to postulate a laryngeal.31 The question of the origin of erebos is further complicated by the existence of another Indo-European root *ereb *orebh “dark, swarthy, stormy” found in Slavic and Old English. Julius Pokorny does not include erebos in this cluster.32 However, Allan Bomhard links *erebh to the Semitic ÷Œrb “to set as the sun, become dark.”33 He sees both as coming from a single Nostratic root. No doubt ÷Œrb is deeply rooted in Semitic. Furthermore, the words araba “black” and orba–“cow with black spots” found in the Central Cushitic languages of Bilen and Saho make it possible that it is common to Afroasiatic as a whole. This makes the suggestion that it is an IndoEuropean loan into Semitic less likely.34 Jasanoff and Nussbaum object to my using the Akkadian form erebu “setting of the sun.” In contrast, they construct a Canaanite form *aribu. I suppose that they derive this form from the Arabic vocalic pattern found in gavriba “be black.” Many other vocalizations of the triconsonantal root, such as gavraba “to set [of the sun]” gavrb “west,” can also be found. In fact, the standard reconstruction of the Canaanite vocalization that preceded the Hebrew Œereb, “evening” is *Œarb. The initial e- in erebos could be derived from the Semitic in two ways. First, John Pairman Brown suggests that it comes from the segholate West Semitic form Œereb itself.35 Segholation, which in this case involved a development *Œarb >Œereb, is generally thought to be late in Hebrew, but the evidence from other Canaanite dialects is not clear. In any event, as Jasanoff and Nussbaum point out, I prefer Astour’s derivation from the Akkadian erebu.36 The appearance of Akkadian forms in Greek can be explained in three ways. First, Akkadian texts may have preserved words in use in Syro-Palestine that have not survived to be attested there. Second, the discovery of the ancient Syrian language Eblaite indicates hard and fast distinctions should not be made between East Semitic and West Semitic. Third, Akkadian was the diplomatic language in Syro-Palestine during the relevant Second Millennium BCE, and an important literary language there as well.



[CH. 7] LEXICON 173
In short, as I stated in Volume 2, two plausible etymologies exist for erebos. I prefer the Semitic one for the semantic reason. There is little
doubt that an Indo-European root *regwos (*rekwvos) existed. Clackson’s and Lejeune’s arguments that the initial e- simply avoids an initial rlessen the certainty of Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s proposal that it is a reflex of the ancient laryngeal *H1. Nevertheless, the Greek prothetic vowel in erebos is explicable in terms of both Indo-European and Semitic. The semantic reason for preferring a Semitic etymology is the clear association of Èrebos with the West’s dark underworld of the dead. This semantic field has very few words of Indo-European origin but a considerable number with plausible derivations from Semitic.37 Nevertheless, while I believe that it is possible for any Greek word without an Indo-European etymology to have a Semitic one, cognicity has to be checked very carefully not merely for phonetics and semantics but also against other possibilities. For example, two forms can rise independently or they can result from Greek loans in Canaanite. Despite these provisos my scope is clearly wider even than those of Pairman Brown, Levin and Szemerényi who have done so much to rescue Semitic etymologies from the troughs into which they had been pushed by the works of Antoine Meillet and Emilia Masson.
The state of Egyptian etymologies for Greek words
Egyptian etymologies of Greek words are even more restricted than those discussed above. As mentioned in Volume 1, acceptance of the reliability of Egyptian texts only came in the 1850s after the establishment of the Aryan Model. Thus, despite Barthelémy’s eighteenth-century work on Greek and Coptic and a few notes by Birch and Brugsch in the 1850s before Egyptology was overcome by the prevailing Aryanism, no tradition existed of Egyptian etymologies for Greek words, comparable to the one from Semitic created by Bochart, Movers, Lewy and MussArnolt.38 Indeed in the 1880s, as mentioned above, the discipline’s doyen Adolf Erman specifically warned Egyptologists off looking for Egyptian origins for Greek forms.39 During the twentieth century, scholars like
Spiegelberg, Erichsen, C±erny and Gunn have accepted some of the earlier hypotheses and have even added one or two etymologies.40 Furthermore, classical scholars have been perfectly willing to accept Egyptian names for such obvious Egyptiana as “ebony,” “ibis,” “Nile perch” and



174 BLACK ATHENA
the Sphinx. Nevertheless, in 1969 when the scholars Bertrand Hemmerdinger and A. G. McGready summarized the position, their totals of acceptable Egyptian loans came to less than forty words, almost all of which were exotic animals or material objects.41 The ideological nature of their criteria for admission can be seen from a quotation from McGready’s article:
Egyptian culture stands to Hellenic as Chinese to European. It is in many ways so alien that Greeks could find little to borrow (in the philological sense), or that they wanted to borrow. Religious and philosophical concepts as developed by the Ancient Egyptians were for the most part too exotic to correspond with anything readily intelligible to a Greek. Under such circumstances it should come as no surprise to find that Greek borrowing [sic] are almost always concrete, referring to things peculiar to Egypt.42
This desire of a scholar, treading on dangerous ground, to assert his orthodoxy is seen again in an article “Egyptian Elements in Greek Mythology” in which the writer ends by saying, “The myths, however, are Greek in spirit despite these borrowings and influences. And let us note that whatever the Greeks acquire from foreigners is finally turned by them into something finer.”43 Even in the 1970s and 1980s there has been no clear movement on the study of Egyptian etymologies in western Europe. Quite the contrary, in a monument of academic niggling and misplaced precision, Richard Halton Pierce felt able to dismiss most of Hemmerdinger’s and McGready’s etymologies.44 In 1989 the French scholar Jean-Luc Fournet reduced the number to seventeen.45 In eastern Europe there was more openness. Between 1962 and 1971 Dr. Constantin Daniel of Bucharest published some constructive articles that proposed Egyptian origins for such centrally significant words as basileuv", h[rw" and titax.46 Daniel was building on the important work of the Soviet Coptologist P. V. Jernstedt who wrote during the improbably open-minded era of linguistics that had flourished in the pit of Stalinism in the early 1950s.47 Since the 1990s consideration of Egyptian etymologies has opened up in the West, and such younger classicists as Garth Alford, Erwin Cook and R. Drew Griffiths have begun to study striking similarities between Egyptian and Homeric imagery and vocabulary.48 When looking for foreign loans one should not give up simply because a word appears to be deeply rooted in the native language. Even



[CH. 7] LEXICON 175
leaving out words beginning with prepositions, cru–sov" “gold” (which is universally admitted to be a borrowing) has 68 entries for derivatives in Liddell and Scott’s dictionary. buvsso" (H) from the Canaanite bus≥ (The Phoenician bs≥ and Hebrew bus≥ or bûs≥) “linen and other cloths, stuff ” has formed verbs buvw(5), ejmbuvw(5) and ejpibuvw (5) “to stuff ” in which the final consonant of the root has been dropped as if it were a morphological feature.49 To take an example from a loan in the other direction, Mishnaic Hebrew contains the following words: zåwag “to marry, to join”; zeweg “marriage”; zugåh “intended, borrowed” and zûg “pair, yoke.” The last gives the game away. They are all derived from the Greek zeuvgo" “yoke” with its clearly Indo-European etymology. The presence of many varied forms should give grounds for pause but cannot be used to rule out the possibility of a loan. The only reason for completely ruling out a loan would be the existence of an equally plausible or better cognate in a genetically related language that was not itself in contact with a possible outside source.
ANCIENT GREEKS’ SENSE OF LEXICAL BORROWING
In his play The Phoenician Women Euripides strongly implied that the heroic invaders spoke Phoenician:
You too Epaphos, son of Zeus, Born long ago to Io our ancestress, I invoke the song of the East, With prayers in the Phoenician tongue, Come, come to this city: For you Thebes was founded by your descendants.50
Although many of the founding heroes were supposed to have come from Egypt, there is to my knowledge no suggestion of their having spoken Egyptian. On the other hand, Homer refers several times to “the language of the Gods.” The references usually take the form: “it is called x by the Gods and by men y.”51 Could this divine speech have been Egyptian? The concept of a “language of the gods” existed in the Egyptian term m(w)dw ntr. P. V. Jernstedt’s proposal that m(w)dw (the Coptic is moute “speech, language”) is the source for muvqo" “myth” is very plau
sible.52 It is interesting that m(w)dw is written with a staff, r (S43). Carleton Hodge made a powerful case that holding a staff gave the right to speak



176 BLACK ATHENA
in the assembly, not only in Ancient Egypt but also in Homeric Greece and places in both east and west Africa. He raises but rejects the possibility that the god Thoth’s staff represented m(w)dw ntr.53 Mythos has no Indo-European etymology. The idea that Egyptian was the Greek language of the Gods is less preposterous than scholars working within the Aryan Model might suppose. In his “Reply of Abammon to Porphyry’s letter to Anebo” the philosopher Iamblikhos of the fourth century CE wrote:
Why do we prefer barbaric signs to those in our respective languages? For this there is a mystic reason. As the gods have taught us that all the language of the sacred peoples such as the Assyrians and Egyptians is suitable for sacred rites. We believe that we should address the gods in the language which is natural to them in formulas that we can choose but as the language is primary and more ancient—so much more for those who first learnt the names of the gods and have transmitted them to us mixing with their own language, that we might always preserve immovable the law of tradition. For if anything suits the gods it is surely the perpetual and immutable that is natural to them. . . . As the Egyptians were the first to communicate with the gods, the latter love to be invoked according to the rites of this people.54
There is no doubt that for most Greeks of the fifth century BCE, Egypt was in some way divine and had a special relationship with the gods. Herodotos’ views on the subject were discussed in Volume 1.55 There is also other evidence. For Aiskhylos, Egypt was the “Sacred land of Zeus and the water of the Nile impossible to pollute.”56 Earlier still and more relevent to the nature of the language of the Gods, however, was Homer’s attitude to Egypt. Akhilles was undoubtedly speaking for his author when he claimed that Thebes in Egypt was the richest and most impressive city in the world.57 What is more, it also had divine and magical superiority. It was there that Helen in her capacity as Artemis of the golden arrows had her divinity renewed through a sacred or magical drug. The poet concludes the passage describing this by stating: “for there [Egypt] the earth, the giver of grain bears greatest store of drugs [favrmaka], many that are healing when mixed and many that are baneful; there every man is a physician, wise above human kind; for they are of the race of Paihvwn [Apollo].58 Given these connotations it seems reasonable to consider the possibility that by “language of the



[CH. 7] LEXICON 177
gods’” Homer meant Egyptian. The hypothesis is testable, and set out below is a glossary of divine and human words and names:
Briavreo" Aijgaivwn 59 Mwvlu60 Murivnh" Bativeia 61 Xavnqo" Skavmandro" 62 Calkiv" Kuvvmindi" 63
The Egyptian etymology of Briareos, with a hundred hands and fifty heads, is discussed in Chapter 19.64 Aigaio@n is more difficult to identify, within Greek mythology he would appear to be connected to Aigeus and, hence, Poseidon, but the name may be derived from the ancient giant ŒÔg. ŒÔg was the last of the subterranean giants, the Rephaim, and his name seems to come from Semitic root ÷Œwg “draw a circle, surround, the whole world.”65 The phonetic parallel is weak but it is possible in view of the striking semantic similarity. If Aigaio@n corresponded to ŒÔg, Semitic words and names could be classified as human not divine. A case can also be made on the other side. Mol–y, the divine name of the magic plant with a black root given to Odysseus by Hermes to protect him from Circe, has been connected by Indo-Europeanists to mulah the Sanskrit word for “root.” On the other hand, Victor Bérard, who maintained that the “language of the gods” was West Semitic, linked Mol–y to mallûah≥ “mallow” or to melah≥ “salt.”66 Astour prefers to associate it with the related verbal root ÷mlh “good” found in Ugaritic and Arabic.67 I find Bérard’s first suggestion the most likely of these. In Book Two of the Iliad Homer wrote, “Now there is before the city a steep mound afar out in the plain, with a clear space about it on this side and that; this do men verily call Bativeia but the immortals call it the barrow of Murivnh ‘light of step.’”68 The human word for this pyramid-like object may be linked to the Greek stem bat “step.” The divine name is inexplicable but its first element does resemble the Egyptian onomastic Mri “loved(of).” It could, for instance, be derived from Mrˆ ˆmn “Beloved of Amon,” a common epithet for pharaohs. Both etymologies, however, remain extremely dubious. The cases for an Egyptian Xanthos and a Semitic Skamandros are discussed in Chapter 10.69 Astour believes that Khalkis, a bird probably a nighthawk, is derived from the West Semitic h°alaq “smooth, hairless” thus suggesting a vulture.”70 One might as well derive it from the Egyptian



178 BLACK ATHENA
h°Åh°“speedy, swift” or “spear fish.” Both are possible but they cannot be accepted, in the absence of any other support. If these words form a coherent whole, which would seem plausible since people are unlikely to risk the impiety of casually inventing divine names, the case for their being Egyptian would seem slightly stronger than that for Canaanite or Greek. Apart from the concept of a language of the gods itself, there are the likely Egyptian origins for Briareos and Xanthos and the plausible Semitic etymology of mol–y. Nevertheless, the picture is far from clear-cut.
LOANS FROM AFROASIATIC INTO GREEK AND INTO ALBANIAN OR ARMENIAN
In the case of Greek, an Indo-European root cannot be assumed when a related word only appears in Greek and one other of three languages: Albanian, Armenian and Latin. Albanian is the sole survivor of an independent branch of Indo-European. It is first attested from the sixteenth century CE. By which time it had absorbed most of its vocabulary from neighboring Indo-European languages—Slavic, Italian, Eastern Romance and Greek. While scholars accept considerable borrowing from Modern Greek over the last 500 years, they are surprised, given the geographic juxtaposition, at the paucity of loans from Ancient Greek. Such loans, however, may well have been masked by an absorption into Albanian phonology. In this case it would be extremely difficult to distinguish genetic cognates from loans. Armenian participation in areal shifts also affected Greek and Semitic, as has been discussed above. Furthermore, by the time it was first attested around 400 CE the language was already full of loan words. These were mostly from Persian but there were also hundreds from Greek and from Semitic, especially Hebrew and Aramaic.71 Thus, where the only attestation of a root is in Greek and Armenian and there is a plausible common Semitic or Egyptian etymology, one must check carefully to see whether the correspondence is the result of normal Indo-European soundshifts. The Afroasiatic etymology should be preferred if this is not the case. In some instances, however, there are no such tests and one has to weigh the two more evenly. For example, the equation between the Armenian sowt “false” and the Greek yeuvdo" (H) would seem shaky within Indo-European.72 It would seem much more plausible either to see the Armenian form as a borrowing from Greek or to derive both



[CH. 7] LEXICON 179
from the Semitic root ÷zwd “to act presumptuously” which is attested in both Hebrew and Aramaic.73 Another example is the words o[neiro" (H) in Greek and anurj in Armenian, both meaning “dream.” (The implausibility of a genetic relationship between them will be discussed in Chapter 9.) Thus, the existence of Greek and Armenian cognates unattested elsewhere in ancient Indo-European languages cannot be relied upon to rule out the possibility of a loan from Egyptian or Semitic or other non-Indo-European languages.
Afroasiatic loans in Armenian and Latin
Latin is attested several centuries earlier than Armenian and did not go through any of the East Mediterranean linguistic shifts of the Second Millennium, but the same principles hold true. Sometimes a double loaning from Afroasiatic into Greek and Latin is indicated by the correlation of sound shifts in the Afroasiatic language or Indo-European. I shall start here with a noncontroversial instance, the place name Tyre. As
mentioned in Chapter 5, the name T≥(y)ôr was borrowed into Greek as
Tuvro". Around the middle of the Second Millennium BCE /t ≥_/merged
with /s≥/ making the Phoenician and Hebrew names s≥ôr. Hence, the Old Latin name for the city was Sor. This name was later supplanted by the Greek Tyre.74 Another example of this distinction between Greek and Latin borrowings arising from sound shifts in Semitic is the pair malavch (H) and malua both meaning “mallow.” The lexicographers of Greek and Latin agree that the two are loans from a non-Indo-European “Mediterranean” language. They did not consider the possibility of a Semitic origin. Maria Louisa Mayer, however, saw the obvious connection with term attested in Job (30.4) mallûah≥ “mallow.”75 As the plant flourishes on salty ground, it certainly derives from the Semitic root ÷mlh≥ “salt.” In Punic /h≥/ became /h/, />/ or zero. Thus the Greek malákhe|–was borrowed before the weakening and the Latin malua after.76 Other similar words that appear in Greek and Latin cannot be so easily related. The possibility that they could be the results of loans from other languages should always be kept open. Furthermore, in the first instance one should look at Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic both because they are relatively well attested and because these two peoples were frequently cited by ancient Greek and Roman writers as having had a major influence on their civilizations.

Semitic traces in Rome and in Latin
Latin’s massive borrowings from Greek are well known and understood. I maintain that between 800 and 400 BCE Latin borrowed almost equally heavily from Semitic, either directly from the Punic spoken in West Phoenicia or indirectly through Etruscan and Greek. This type of contact is unacknowledged—for the same reasons as those discussed in this book regarding Greece.77 Borrowing on such a scale would indicate prolonged and intense contact between Canaanite and Latin and Etruscan speakers. Such a conclusion does not in any way conflict with other sources of evidence. Between 1930 and 1960 Rhys Carpenter and other champions of the Extreme Aryan Model claimed, on the basis of “the argument from silence,” that Phoenicians had not reached the West Mediterranean until the seventh century BCE and even then contacts had been very few and of no cultural significance.78 Even at the time, however, there was some resistance and such scholars as William Albright, Pierre Cintas and G. Charles-Picard continued to maintain the traditional dates for these settlements in the early eighth and ninth centuries and even earlier.79 Since the 1960s, with the turning away from the Extreme Aryan Model, there has been a tendency to return to the traditional chronology. Thus, it is now generally accepted that Phoenicians were present in North Africa, Spain, Sardinia and Sicily well before the traditional foundation of Rome in the middle of the eighth century.80 From historical records we know that Phoenicians and Etruscans had close diplomatic and commercial dealings from the seventh to the second centuries BCE.81 The first of these contacts saw a massive wave of orientalizing in Etruria. Archaeology indicates still earlier relations. A century earlier, many Phoenician practices and objects had made it into Latin: the move from cremation to burial (the Phoenician custom), the use of Aegypto-Phoenician canopic jars and Phoenician “Aeolic” columns and the importation of Egyptian and Phoenician objects, and even more distant objects.82 Through Phoenicia, the Middle East had a massive influence on Etruscan, hence Roman, religion. For example, the Assyriologist Jean Nougayrol has shown how haruspicy, the examination of livers for omens, spread from Babylonia to Etruria through Phoenicia.83 D. Van Berchem has argued convincingly for a Phoenician origin of the temple and cult of Hercules, the oldest in Rome.84 Ivory chairs and Tyrian purple cloth undoubtedly had religious and political significance in Rome. Even in antiquity the striking institutional parallels between



[CH. 7] LEXICON 181
the two elected suffetes (sopE–tîm “judges”) in Carthage and the Roman consuls were acknowledged.85 The elements -sil and -sul in con–silium and con–sul, the ancient forms of which were consol and cosol, have been difficult to explain in terms of Indo-European. Ernout and Meillet dismiss a derivation from a hypothetical root *sel found in the Greek eJlei`n “take” or from *con-sidium “sitting together.” They continue, “Reste l’hypothèse d’un emprunt, qui n’est pas impossible, mais qui reste indémontrable” [There remains the hypothesis of a borrowing, which is not impossible, but remains undemonstrable]. In fact, a clear source exists for a loan: the Semitic root ÷s<l probably from forms of the Canaanite så<el “to ask, enquire” with the present participle so<el . The verb is well rooted in Semitic and the semantic match is nearly perfect.86 The Assyriologist and legal historian Raymond Westbrook has noted strong Semitic influences on the earliest Roman law, the so-called Twelve Tables.87 The failure, until recently, of modern historians of Rome to draw obvious conclusions from this type of evidence is not surprising when one knows they come from a tradition founded by Niebuhr and Mommsen.88 Given all these indications of contact, it would be surprising if there had not been considerable borrowings from West Semitic into Latin. A few words have been considered as possible Punic or Numidian (Berber) loans: mapali–a or magalia “hut” and mappa “napkin” and, interestingly, the greeting aue.89 These, however, are not the only indications of the importance of Semitic languages in the creation of Latin. Thus, it would seem useful to give a few more examples. For a city set on seven hills, the name Ro–ma and the Etruscan clan name Ruma are more plausibly derived from the common Canaanite place-name Råmåh “citadel, high place” than from some version of the Indo-European~root *sreu “flow.”90 The Masoretic vowel sound that is represented here by /å/ was not, as is commonly supposed, a long /a–/ but represented a vocalization between /a/ and /o/. Although most cities of the region have Italic or Etruscan names, there are also Semitic ones. Cortona would seem to belong to the “Kiryat” group discussed in Chapter 20. Nepete appears to come from the Semitic root ÷nbt≥ “gush forth” (of water) or oasis. People of the deserts or oases were sometimes called Nabati or Nabataeans in Arabia or Nobatai in the eastern Sahara whose city on the Upper Nile was known as Nabata or Napata.91 Combining the Canaanite suffix -on with ÷nbt≥ provides the most plausible origin of the divine name Neptune. He was the god of ground



182 BLACK ATHENA
water as well as of the sea. Neptune was also the patron of chariots, which were widely used by the savage inhabitants of the oases of the Sahara in the First Millennium BCE.92 Nepete was a town south of Rome with a river and springs. As the antiquarian Dennis described it in the 1840s, “He [the traveler] has left the open wastes of the Campagna and entered a wooded district. It is one of the few portions of central Italy that will remind him, if an Englishman, of home. Those sweeps of bright green sward—the whole forms a lively initiation of—what is most rare on the continent—English park scenery.”93 To return to Latium, the most plausible etymology for Ti–bur, the classical name of Tivoli, which is set on a striking mountain, must come from the Hebrew toponym for mountains, t ≥åbur (with the vocalization Tibur in Aramaic) “navel, central mountain,” Tı–bur is where the Anio River (now Aniene) bursts out of the mountains. It meets the present Tiber just north of Rome. The striking similarity of names suggests that the river flowing through the city gained its name from the mountain.94 As mentioned above, tåbur or tabor occurs with a prothetic a- or with the article ha-, as in Atabyrion, the highest mountain on Rhodes.95 Another tributary of the Tiber was the Na–r, now the Nera. It flowed between the territory of the Sabines and Umbria, and the Umbrian name was Nahar. Servius, the commentator on the Aeneid, derived the name from a Sabine word for sulfur—the river has sulfurous springs.96 The Sabine or Sabellian language, however, had ceased to be spoken centuries before 400 CE when Servius flourished. This etymology was probably no more than a reasonable speculation. It is much more plausible to derive Na–r/Nahar from the Canaanite nåhår “stream, river,” a word that is deeply embedded in Semitic. The Tarpaean rock upon which prisoners were executed and their bodies exposed, appears to have been near the Roman Capitol. Its name is sometimes supposed to be Etruscan and related to the royal name Tarquin.97 Labiovelars, however, have not been found to break down in Etruscan or Latin, though they did in Oscan.98 Furthermore, the final -n or -m in Saxum Tarpeium appears to be merely morphological. A more probable derivation is from the Canaanite t≥årap “to tear, rend” or t ≥rêpå “torn flesh” and terep “prey” and “mountains of terep” appears to mean the torn flesh of a lions lair.99 Turning from place-names, we can find other interesting forms in Latin. Some important Latin words may have the same origins: amo’–“I love” and its many cognates, amicus etc., may come, as Pokorny sup



[CH. 7] LEXICON 183
poses, from a stem *amm “mother,” common to many Indo-European languages.100 -Mm- is, in fact, a worldwide stem for mother and breast.101 The Afroasiatic root *Œam, found in Central Chadic and Dahalo as well as Semitic, means “relative, uncle, friend.”102 Thus, the specific Latin term amita “father’s sister” almost certainly comes from the Canaanite Œam “kinsman on the father’s side” and Œamît “associate, fellow, relation.” There are many parallels for this in Semitic and elsewhere in Afroasiatic. Amo–would seem to come from both Afroasiatic and Indo-European sources. The Latin sec–ur–us has always been given the charming folk etymology of se- “away from,” and -cur–a “care.” Indeed, se- can be used as a prefix of separation. Sec–ur–us, however, can be much more plausibly derived from the Canaanite passive participle *sakûr “dam, shut up”; sågûr with the same meaning is attested and there is the Akkadian sikkurum “door bolt.” The conventional Indo-Europeanist etymology for curi–a “a village or division of the Roman people” is from a hypothetical *ko-wiriyå co-vir “with man.” It is much more plausible to derive it from the Canaanite qryt “city,” discussed below in Chapter 20. The scholar Varro of the first century BCE derived the Latin idus “days and nights of the full moon” from Etruscan. There is no reason to doubt this but that leaves the question of the origin of the Etruscan word. The twentieth-century lexicographers Ernout and Meillet have dismissed the suggestion that it came from a hypothetical Etruscan word “to divide” and they are skeptical of any Indo-European etymology. It would seem more likely to come from a Semitic root, probably derived from the Sumerian itu “month” but occurring in the Arabic Œid “feast, feast day.” A final example of a Latin loan from Semitic is summa. This form is undoubtedly related to the Oscan somo, but cognicity with the Sanskrit upama “uppermost” is very doubtful.103 It would seem much more plausible to derive it from the Afroasiatic and Semitic root *sam “high” attested in Semitic in the Ugaritic smm, the Phoenician smm and the Hebrew s  ̈åmayim “heavens.”104 A more general sense of “high” is found in the Aramaic and Syriac s  ̈Emayi> and the Arabic sama–“was high, lofty.” This was almost certainly the origin of the “old word” reported by Strabo to be in the Greek place-name element sam- found in Samos, Samothrace and other high places.105 Although the predominant vocalization of the root in Semitic languages is with an /a/, it does occur with /u/, as in the Arabic sumu–“height.” If all, or most, of these etymologies are accepted, their centrality would



184 BLACK ATHENA
indicate that they are the tip of an iceberg and that Latin (and Etruscan) was permeated with Semitic words. Thus, there would seem no reason to deny the possibility of a Semitic loan into Greek merely because the word is also attested in Latin.
Egyptian to Latin
As far as I am aware, no evidence exists of an Egyptian presence in Italy in the first half of the First Millennium BCE.106 Thus, any Egyptian influences on early Rome would be indirect, through Etruscan, Punic or Greek. Not surprisingly, therefore, to my knowledge, only one Italian toponym possesses a possible Egyptian origin. Pisa would seem to come from PÅ sÅ or Pr sÅ “the marsh or low shore, house of the marsh or low shore.” Pr in place-names is rendered Pi- in the Bible. Both the Italian Pisa and the one in Elis in the northwestern Peloponnese are situated on low swampy shores. There are two similar Latin words urbs “city” and orbis “circle.”107 John Pairman Brown has made a strong case for the religious significance of a circle, marked by a wall or a mere furrow, in the foundation of Rome and other cities.108 The Middle Egyptian root wÅb has various meanings “socket of a tooth or tree, swaddling clothes.” WÅbt is “mound, high lying agricultural land, the body of the Red Crown, without the snake.” The common theme would seem to be “circle, encircling.”109 The use of wÅbt to mean “mound, high lying agricultural land” suggests that the sense of urbs may already have been present in Egyptian. Such a suggestion is strengthened by the appearance of wÅbw as a place-name meaning “settlement.”110 Ernout and Meillet state that urbs is “sans doute emprunté” [without doubt borrowed]. They also deny the etymology of orbis from the Greek ejrevfw “I cover” on both phonetic and semantic grounds. All they can do is to relate it to the Umbrian urfeta. The correspondence of the Egyptian /Å/ to a liquid shows that the borrowing must have occurred in the Second Millennium. Therefore, and given the Umbrian cognate, it is likely that it was translated into other Italic languages or into Etruscan before reaching Latin. Other fundamental Latin words derive ultimately from Egyptian. The Middle Egyptian Åtp meant “to load, carry.” Lexicographers have puzzled over the parallels and differences between the Greek livtra (4) and the Latin libra both meaning “weights.” As the Greek word is associated with Sicily, Chantraine proposed that both derived from a non-Indo-European



[CH. 7] LEXICON 185
“Sicilian substrate.” Ernout and Meillet simply state that libra comes from a non-Indo-European substrate. The Egyptian etymology from Åtp would explain the alternation t/b but here again the liquid /Å/ indicates that the loan must come from the Second Millennium.111 The Late Egyptian psn meant “loaf.” Because of the diminutive form past–illus, the Latin panis “bread” has been traced back to a hypothetical *pa ̈s ̈nis. Thus, the phonetic fit is as excellent as the semantic one. Ernout and Meillet write of the Latin preposition ob “in front of, against”: “il est impossible d’en donner une étymologie rigoureuse” [it is impossible to give it a rigorous etymology]. Naturally by etymology they mean Indo-European etymology. The words wbÅ in Demotic Egyptian and ube in Coptic both mean “in the face of.” Although the Egyptian and Latin words are obviously connected, the direction of borrowing is not clear. Given the difficulties in explaining ob in the well-worked-out Indo-European language family, the probability is clearly that it went from Egyptian to Latin not vice versa. The Egyptian pr ntr, pi ntr in Demotic is, “home of the god, shrine, temple.”112 The much more frequent h≥t ntr will be discussed at length in Chapter 22. The Latin penetralia originally meant “inmost, most sacred parts of a building.” From this came penetrare “penetrate” and, possibly, Penate–s “household gods,” although these may come from pÅ ntr “the god.” After denying some semantically far-fetched hypotheses, Ernout and Meillet write about this cluster, “despite its Indo-European aspect, this group of words is without an etymology.” Pi ntr provides a good alternative.113 The Latin sero i–s “to tie in a file.” Thus de ̈sero,–past participle desertum, means to de-link or “desert.” In another sense, desertum was used in Church Latin to translate the Greek hJe[remo" “wilderness, desert.” The Egyptian ds+rt, used until the Ptolemaic period, also meant “desert.” Ds+rt derives from the adjective ds+r “red” and was used in contrast to Kmt “the black land, Nilotic Egypt.” Thus the Egyptian origin of desertum in this sense is clear.114
CONCLUSION
In this chapter I have tried to show that relatively little work has looked into the possibilities of Afroasiatic etymologies for Indo-European languages, especially those languages carrying a heavy cultural load such as Greek and Latin. The chapter fails to tackle the clearly important Semitic



186 BLACK ATHENA
influences on Armenian but does sketch out what appears to be the substantial component of Afroasiatic loans in the Latin vocabulary. Therefore, unless they correspond to regular phonetic developments in the languages, cognates between Greek and Armenian or between Greek and Latin that are not found in other Indo-European languages should be treated with great caution.



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 187
INTRODUCTION
T
his chapter is concerned with lexical borrowings from Egyptian and West Semitic into Greek and in particular with their relation to the changes that took place in the two Afroasiatic languages during the more than three thousand years from 3000 BCE to 300 CE. To assess the phonetic plausibility of loans from the two Afroasiatic languages into Greek, we must first outline what is known about the shifting phonetics of the three languages. In estimating the possibility or probability of a loan, I have tried to reduce subjectivity—though not, of course, eliminating it—by applying a method devised by the Egyptologist Werner Vycichl to assess loaning between Egyptian and Semitic. He gave a possible three points for phonetic correspondence, usually the triliteral root, and up to three points for semantic similarity, which is far harder to quantify.1 To be accepted at all, a possible loan must accumulate at least four points; to be strong it should have five. To be virtually certain it must possess all six. To give some examples: Dwdwvnh Do–do–na, the most ancient Greek oracle and cult center of Zeus, matches Ddwn, the name of the form of Zeus’ Egypto-Libyan counterpart Am(m)on that was worshipped at the Siwa oasis in the Western Desert, also a cult center and oracle. Priestesses at Do–do–na told Herodotos of specific links between Do–do–na and Siwa.2

Thus, this proposed loan has the three necessary semantic points. On the phonetic side, there are three consonants in the proper sequence and one vowel—four points altogether, one more than the necessary three correspondences. Therefore, as a whole, the Egypto-Libyan etymology of the Greek toponym is virtually perfect. A derivation of the Greek kovsmo" (H) from the Semitic root ÷qsm provides an example of a strong etymology. The relationship with the English “cosmos” and “cosmetics” comes from the basic sense of the Greek word as “order, organization” and the verb kosméo–“to set in order.” The Semitic ÷qsm means “to allocate, assign,” especially of a divinity. Qåsam appears in biblical Hebrew in the limited sense of “to practice divination.” There is no reason, however, to doubt that Canaanite retained the basic meaning of “to assign.”3 The phonetic parallel between Greek and Semitic is 3 out of 3 and the semantic 2 out of 3. Thus it should be considered a “strong” etymology. An apparently “strong” etymology is the derivation of the Greek calepov" (H) “painful, cruel, severe” from the Egyptian hr°p; “baton of office govern, control,” hr°pw “mallet” and hr°pt “dues, taxes.” Here the phonetic equation is perfect, but semantic parallel, although reasonable, is less so. It is, nevertheless, reinforced by a similar word kovlafo" (2) “punch, beating.”4 Thus, so far, I would award the Egyptian etymology of khalepós five points.5 In this case, however, one encounters a problem not faced by Vycichl who was only considering correspondences within Afroasiatic: that of competitive Indo-European etymologies. A strong Indo-European cognate for a Greek word eliminates all except the exceptionally good Afroasiatic alternatives. To continue with hr°p; and kólaphos “punch, beating,” Chantraine relates this and kolavptw kolápto (–5) “gash, cut” but also “to hammer, destroy by hammering” to the Lithuanian kalù, kalti “forge” and kovptw kópto–(H) “punch, strike” to the Lithuanian kapiu “cut, hit.” While the latter is possible, the relationship between kolapto,–kalù, and kalti is weakened by the improbability that speakers of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) forged metal. In any event, unlike the Lithuanian competitor, the Egyptian hr°p and the nominal form hr°pw “mallet” match all the consonants of kólaphos and the final -to i–n kolápto c–an be explained as a verbal suffix. The Indo-European competitor only reduces the Egyptian etymology for khalepos, kolaphos and kolapto–by one point leaving it with four. Therefore, it is still “reasonable.”6 Examples of strong etymologies from both Indo-European and



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 189
Afroasiatic, like that of érebos “place of darkness” or harpe–“sickle, scimitar,” should be carefully balanced. I discussed the case of érebos in the last chapter and in an earlier work.7 The eminent classicist Walter Burkert, following a scholarly tradition going back to the nineteenth century, de
rives harpe f–rom the Semitic root ÷h≥rb found in the Hebrew h≥ereb < *h≥arb and the Aramaic h≥arba “–sword,” which were originally curved.8 The idea of curvature and a sickle is strengthened by the Egyptian h°Åbb or hÅb “crookedness”; the first of these forms is written with two jaws. Heinrich Lewy, however, found a strong Indo-European etymology in the Latin sarpio “cut vines,” and the Old Church Slavonic srupu “sickle.”9 In general it would seem best to set both out and consider the possibility of a convergence. Other things being equal, however, we should give the benefit of the doubt to the genetic claim.10 In this case, however, circumstantial evidence backs the Semitic ÷h≥rb as at least one source of harpe.1–1 The corresponding phonetics of all of the etymologies referred to above are attested in transcriptions or generally accepted etymologies. Other correspondences, however, are not so recorded but become plausible when one looks at the changes that took place within Semitic and Egyptian from approximately 3000 to 500 BCE.
SEMITIC
In Chapter 7, I described many of the phonetic developments in Greek. The language is by far the most accurately known of the three considered here. Even the Linear B script of the Mycenaean period marks both consonants and vowels (although crudely) in its syllabary. The Greek alphabet provides good information on both consonants and vowels. Furthermore, in the Hellenistic period, after Alexander’s conquests at the end of the fourth century BCE, the prestige of Greek and the need to teach it accurately to non-Greek speakers led to massive scholarship on its accentuation. This scholarship has been preserved. The transcription of Greek words and names into Coptic and Hebrew provides further information on pronunciation from the third century BCE. Ancient Egyptian and West Semitic present greater difficulties. To begin with, there is the definition of terms. I use “West Semitic” to encompass all the Semitic languages spoken along or inland from the Levantine coast in the last two thousand years BCE. These include Amorite, Aramaic, Ugaritic, and the Canaanite dialects. Eblaite written in Syria in the Third Millennium is a marginal member of this group.12 I accept

the conventional, but arbitrary, definition of “Canaanite” as the West Semitic language spoken in the southern Levant after 1500 BCE and before the triumph of Aramaic that followed the successes of the Babylonian and Persian empires in the sixth century. By far the most famous of the Canaanite dialects are Phoenician and Hebrew, spoken throughout the First Millennium BCE and into CE. Eblaite and Amorite were written in syllabic cuneiform. Thus it is possible to reconstruct at least an approximate vocalization for them. All the other West Semitic languages and dialects, however, were written with alphabets that fundamentally represented only consonants. The most purely consonantal script was the Phoenician. More archaic alphabets did, however, provide some indications of vocalization. The Ugaritic alphabet included three alephs >a, >e/i and >u, and Hebrew used the two semivowels /w/ and /y/ as well as /h/ as matres lectionis to indicate rounded, frontal and broad vowels respectively. From these, one can gain a general sense of the vocalization. For the later period this sense is reinforced by transcriptions of many names, and some words, into Greek and Latin. The most important Greek texts are the translation of the Old Testament into the Greek Septuagint circa 250 BCE; Josephus’ retelling of its “historical” contents in Greek in his The Antiquities of the Jews in the first century CE; and the New Testament’s rendering of Hebrew place and personal names into Greek. The phonetic equivalencies established by these transcriptions form the basis of those I propose for loans from Semitic into Greek listed in Appendix A. I do not feel the need to justify them for individual loans but I offer justification when I go beyond them. An even better source for the early vocalization of West Semitic and Canaanite comes from within the tradition itself. Between the sixth and the tenth centuries CE, Jewish scholars, convinced that the efficacy of prayer and ritual depended on accurate pronunciation, set up a number of systems of diacritical marks or “points.” These indicated, among other things, quality (although not quantity) of vowels. The culmination of this tradition and unification of these systems came in the tenth century with the standard so-called Masoretic text.13 The Masoretic system drew on a very ancient and conservative tradition and, therefore, almost certainly indicates the Hebrew pronunciation of the First Millennium BCE. Major shifts in both vowels and consonants in West Semitic took place during the last two millennia BCE. Hebrew and Phoenician dialects differed in pronunciation. Phoenician provided the most loans into Greek



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 191
between 1200 and 300 BCE. The Phoenician shifts in this period /o/> /u/ and /u/>/ü/ were discussed in Chapter 5.14 Nevertheless, the Hebrew consonantal alphabet and the Masoretic system of vowel markers have provided a good basis for making assessments for both earlier and later loans.
Vowels
Another problem is that Afroasiatic languages frequently have ablaut or vowel alteration to mark differences of tense, mood, activity, causation etc. in verbs. These alterations can also distinguish verbs from nouns, as well as mark the difference in number among nouns (compare the IndoEuropean verbal roots sing, sang, sung, song or bind, bound, band, bond). For instance, the Hebrew verb with the root ÷ktb “to write” is transmuted kåtab, yikto\b, kEto\b, kot\e\b, niktab, kitte\b, kuttab, hiktîb, håktab and hitkatte\ b. Such distinctions are particularly difficult when only the consonants are indicated. When assessing the probability of loans, we can find it hard to know which form would provide a likely etymon.
Consonants
As with the vowels, the basis for the phonetic parallels between West Semitic and Greek consonants given here will be those proven by the transcription into Greek of the Phoenician and Hebrew texts mentioned above. Attention is paid to the initial, medial and final position of the consonants and, as far as possible, to their position in relation to the vowels of the pointed Masoretic text. Some of the consonantal transcriptions are surprising and worth mentioning here. They include Semitic /b/ to Greek /m/ and vice versa; /d/ to /r/ and vice versa; initial r- /for n- and medial -n- for -r-; tsade is transcribed as /s/ in all positions; /z/ as initial and final; /t/ as initial or final; /ss/tt/ in medial or final. Complications of the Greek transcriptions of /s=/, /s v/ and /s/ will be discussed in Chapter 13. Earlier West Semitic sibilants lost in Canaanite caused still more confusion. For instance, the West Semitic form t≥pn “distant place to the north and source of violent winds” appears to have produced zevfuri" (H) “west or northwest wind, violent storm”; zovfo" (H) “darkness, obscure region, the west”; yevfa" (5) “obscurity and gloom”; dnovfo" (H) “obscurity and gloom”; knevfa" (H) “obscurity, and gloom” and doupo" (H) “heavy distant noise



192 BLACK ATHENA
of battle.” Finally, we find Tu±fav–wn or Tufw'n, mythical father of the winds as a word “torment, storm.” In later times Tufw'n was seen as the Greek counterpart to Seth, the wild god of wilderness outside the Nile Valley.15 Other West Semitic transcriptions into Greek also demonstrate their great antiquity. An example of an early transcription of gV as g before the merger of gVain with Œain around the middle of the Second Millennium comes in the city name called  ́Gazzeh in Arabic Gdt in Egyptian and Gavza in Greek but Œazzåh in later Canaanite. See also the city name Megara, to be discussed in Chapter 20. These parallel the names of Byblos and Tyre, which can be shown on phonetic grounds to have been standardized before 1400 BCE.16 Therefore, the toponyms were introduced into Greek before the phonetic shifts around the middle of the Second Millennium. These and the discovery of Semitic loan words on tablets in Linear A and B all confirm the possibility of older West Semitic influences upon Greek widening the phonetic range when looking for loans between them.
EGYPTIAN
Vowels
The reconstruction of the Egyptian language for early periods shares the uncertainties of West Semitic, as well as possessing other difficulties. With few exceptions, the ancient writing systems—hieroglyphic, hieratic and demotic—only indicate consonants. Problems with these will be discussed below. Coptic, the latest stage of the Egyptian language, written with the Greek alphabet, and supplemented by a few signs drawn from Demotic, was vocalized. Even here, however, the vowels are not altogether clear. For instance, Joseph Greenberg argued against convention that the /w/ and the /H/ in Coptic should not be read, as they are in Greek, as long vowels /o–/ and /e–/, but as vowels of a different quality.17 Before Greenberg’s challenge, scholars felt able to deduce the length of vowels from Coptic. As Alan Gardiner, author of the still standard Egyptian Grammar, put it, “scholars have succeeded in determining from the Coptic the position and quantity of original values in a large number of words; but the quality is far less easily ascertainable.”18 In general, however, Gardiner was extremely skeptical: “The vowels and consonants of the older language have usually become modified in



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 193
the course of time, so that the more recent can at best only serve as the basis for inference.”19 Gardiner wrote in the first half of the last century. Even today, however, the precariousness of the reconstruction of Middle Egyptian vowels is illustrated by the work of Antonio Loprieno, who is devoting his scholarly life to the study and systematization of Ancient Egyptian. He writes that the
divorce between methodological requirements and philological evidence has urged modern scholars to draw a distinction between two realities underlying our historical study of Egyptian: (1) the linguistic system resulting from a regular application of the morphophonological rules of derivation of Coptic forms from Egyptian antecedents, conventionally called “pre-Coptic Egyptian”; (2) the forms which emerge from the actual reality of Egyptian texts, i.e. “hieroglyphic Egyptian.” The reasons for the fact that “hieroglyphic Egyptian” appears much less regular than “pre-Coptic” are twofold. First . . . the Egyptian graphic system. . . . There is also another aspect to this issue. . . . The reconstructed “pre-Coptic Egyptian” is an idealized linguistic system: even if the rules for its reconstruction were all correct, which is in itself very doubtful, this redundant system would still not be a mirror of an actual historical reality . . . the actual historical manifestations of Egyptian were probably less regular than reconstructed “pre-Coptic,” but more diversified than is betrayed by “hieroglyphic Egyptian.”20
Loprieno’s concern here is with morphophonology, but his strictures on the artificial or idealized nature of “pre-Coptic” hold for phonology as whole. To further complicate and enlarge the range of the vocalization of possible loans into Greek, Egyptian, as an Afroasiatic language, appears to have had ablaut in both verbs and nouns, just as Semitic did. A further difficulty in considering loans from a language in which only the consonants are recorded is that usually one is unable to tell whether a medial consonant was flanked by vowels or consonants. These positions put consonants under very different pressures. For instance in Chapter 5, innovation number 4 was the disappearance of initial and intervocalic /s/.21 Those next to other consonants survived.



194 BLACK ATHENA
Consonants
I shall begin with the conventional view as modified from the Egyptological traditions of the nineteenth century, based on Coptic and parallels with Semitic. According to this view, the series of voiced and unvoiced stops was complete /b/, /p/; /d/, /t/ and /g/, /k/. The only clear survivor of the emphatic series was /q/ (often written k≥). The Œayin, which is assumed to have resembled the Semitic sound, still found in Arabic, of closing the pharynx, is also supposed by some to be emphatic. This was opposed to the sign corresponding to the Semitic >aleph or yod,
transcribed as ˆ. In addition to these the earlier palatalized sounds *gy
and *ky in Afroasiatic appear to have become *dy and *ty and are conventionally written d and t by Egyptologists.22 (D was also found to parallel the Semitic emphatics /s≥/ and /t≥/.)23 In Late Egyptian, starting through
out Egypt around 1600 BCE, the *dy and *ty tended to fall in with /t/ and /d/. Furthermore, the /q/ often merged with the /k/. The “oppositions between voiced and unvoiced phonemes became gradually neutralized,” in this period.24 The same process of neutralization began somewhat earlier with the sibilants. Originally they were written /z/, /s/ and /s±/. However, /z/ and /s/ appear to have been neutralized even in Middle Egyptian. This neutralization was the first merger between voiced and unvoiced sounds. German Egyptologists tend to keep the distinction between the two; anglophones do not, although both schools clearly demarcate /s/ from /S=/. There were four different aspirates or laryngeals /h/, /h/, /h≥/ and /h°/. Apparently, h was a palatalized /h°/ or /h≥/, which early interchanged with /S=/.25 /H≥/ corresponded to the Semitic h≥et and /h°/ to the harsh kha of Arabic.
Changing Egyptian forms
THE DOUBLE OR VULTURE ALEPH. The letter about which there has been the most debate is the transcription for the so-called “double” or “vul
ture aleph” Åa. Early Egyptologists working from very late Egyptian texts recognized that this sign merely indicated modified vowels. Therefore, they saw it as a an alternative aleph. In the twentieth century, however, scholars began to realize that in Middle Kingdom texts the sign was used to represent Semitic personal and place-names containing/r/ or



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 195
/l/. Scholarly tradition dies hard, however, and until some thirty years ago most Egyptologists still thought of /Å/ as a glottal stop.26 Work on Afroasiatic as a whole has greatly strengthened the interpretation of /Å/ as a liquid by showing the number of cognates with /l/ and /r/ not merely in Semitic but also in Chadic and Berber. Thus, now the debate is between the German linguist Otto Rössler and his disciples who claim that in early Egyptian /Å/ was always a liquid or “uvular trill” and others who are reluctant to give up the idea that it was sometimes a glottal stop.27 Those who are not complete Rösslerians debate as to proportions. Some, like Orel and Stolbova who are lexicographers of Afroasiatic, still maintain that the basic sound was >aleph though they admit that some “double alephs” were liquids.28 Others, like Antonio Loprieno and Gabor Takács, see /Å/ as basically a liquid but with some correspondences to Afroasiatic glottal stops.29 This seems to me the most reasonable position. The change from liquid to vowel modifier took place during the New Kingdom. It is impossible to be more precise as to when, during that period of almost 400 years (1575–1200), the transformation took place. It was certainly an unclear, drawn out and patchy pro
cess.30 The letter r transcribed as /r/ went through a similar
transformation somewhat later. We know, from a number of loans in which the Greek form has retained both the Egyptian s- and /Å/ as a liquid, that the general Egyptian vocalization of a /Å/ took place after the Greek shift sV>hV and VsV>VhV. In their criticism of the linguistic aspect of my work, Jay Jasanoff and Alan Nussbaum were appalled by what they saw as my lack of rigor in proposing different values for /Å/ in Greek words derived from the Egyptian. They wrote in reference to my etymology of the Greek kar–/ker–/ (H) from the Egyptian kÅ (which will be discussed in Chapter 1031), “From the phonetic point of view the equation is hopeless: neither here nor anywhere else is there a shred of evidence to support Bernal’s oft-repeated claim that Egyptian Å was sometimes borrowed as /r/ in Greek.”32 Here one must ask whether the difference lies with the observers or in the situation itself. Earlier scholars never considered the possibility that the liquids in Greek words could be derived from /Å/ because, as already discussed, until some thirty years ago, most Egyptologists still thought of the /Å/ as a glottal stop. In addition, despite their acknowl
edgment that the name Aigyptos (from the Egyptian H≥t kÅ Pth≥) was in use in Mycenaean Greece, linguists have not considered the possibility of loans from Egyptian into Greek before the First Millennium BCE. Thus,



196 BLACK ATHENA
in establishing etymologies of Greek words, they only used the sound values of very late Egyptian. We now know from texts and archaeology that there was close contact around the East Mediterranean during the Second Millennium.33 Thus, one cannot refuse to consider the possibility of loans from Egyptian words both during the period when /Å/ was a liquid and after it was merely vocalic.34
LOANS AND PHONETIC CHANGES IN THE DOUBLE ALEPH
1. kÅm. A cluster of early Egyptian words—kÅnw (later kÅm), “garden vineyard” “garden, vineyard, flowers,” and kÅny (later kÅmw) “vintner, gardener, wines, fruits vegetables” offers an example of phonetic changes having different results in loans. The earliest loan from this cluster seems to be from kÅny/w in the sense of “vintner” to the divine name krono". Kronos’ most famous deed was the castration of his father Uranos using, according to Hesiod, an a{rphn karcaravdonta “jagged toothed sickle.”35 This suggests an ancient implement of flint set with microliths.36 The importance of this violent act is brought out by the fact that the symbol of Crovno" (H) “time” (see below) with whom Kronos was later confused, was his scythe. Clearly, kÅm was related to the West Semitic *karm the Hebrew kerem found in Carmel (hence, through Carmelite nuns, “caramel”). The Semitic form may well have influenced the Egyptian change of final consonant from -n to -m during the New Kingdom.37 Because of the relationship between Egyptian and West Semitic, it is difficult to tell which of the two languages a Greek form was borrowed from. In the first place, there are the extensions with both -n and -m of the word klavw (H) “to break, break off.” These include klwvn (5) “twig, branch” (clone), klwnivth" “with shoots,” klwnivzw “to trim, a tree and vine.” With -m there are klh'ma, “vinestock or shoot” and kremavnnnvmi “to hang like grapes.” None of these have generally accepted Indo-European etymologies.38 The development in Egyptian seems to have been *karm>*ka>m> *kam, and with the shift a–>o–, *ko–m. In Coptic it is palatalized to c=o\m, “vineyard, field, garden” and c=me “vintner, gardener, someone who prepares wine or oil.”39 Greek has a cluster of words around kw'mo" (4), which has no satisfactory Indo-European etymology but does have a general sense of “revelry associated with alcohol.”40 A kwmasiva was a “joyful procession of the gods in Egypt.” A kwmasthv" was a drinker who took part in the festival; the word was also a biname for Dionysos. The best-known



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 197
derivatives of ko\mos are kwmw≥dov" (4) “singer who leads the ko\mos.” This leads on to kwmikov" (4) “comic.” Finally, there is kw'ma (H) “profound sleep” or “lethargy,” the aftereffect of revelry? Brugmann associated ko\ma, with slight difficulty over the length of the vowel, with kei'mai “lie down.”41 Chantraine considers this a possibility but still finds the etymology of ko\ma “obscure.”
2. tÅS+.The Egyptian tÅS+became ts, in Demotic and thoS,+ tho\S+in the
Bohairic dialect (B) and toS,+ toS+in the Sahidic dialect (S) and in Coptic. For simple geographic reasons, the northern Bohairic dialect is, in gen
eral, more likely to have influenced Greek. The meaning of tÅS+ was “border.” In irrigated land, boundaries are often demarcated by ditches or canals. It is, therefore, not surprising that before the New Kingdom
the determinative with which tÅS+was frequently written was a simplified
variant of v (N36) “canal.” This form was more widely employed as
a determinative for lakes, rivers and seas. It was used, for instance, in the standard word for “sea” wÅd wr.42 A case will be made in Chapter 16 that a Semitic word for “canal,” with the consonantal structure ÷plg, is the etymon of pevlago" (H) “high sea.” This provides an interesting parallel.
TÅS+, which Vycichl reconstructs as *ta–ÅiS=, provides a reasonable etymon for qavlassa (H) “sea” in Greek, a word that has mystified scholars for centuries.43 Both Frisk and Chantraine see it as a loan word. The more restricted sense of tÅS+may be reflected in tevlson (H) “edge of a field.” Vycichl points out a plural writing tSiv-w which he interprets as *tivS+-w. This interpretation could explain the front vowel in telson. Frisk says it has no “sure etymology.” Chantraine, too, describes it as “uncertain” but sees the edge of a field as where the ox turns around and,
therefore, links it to the Indo-European root *kwel “turn.” If we accept that the sign conventionally rendered as /S=/ had changed from h°>S=by 2500 BCE (see below), the borrowings of thálassa and telson must have taken place after that date. Normally /Å/ lost its liquid quality in the second half of the Second Millennium BCE. A Late Egyptian writing
aW Åw, however, indicates that in this case the “vulture” >aleph retained
a consonantal value rather later.44 Thus, the two words could have been borrowed in this period. A third possible borrowing is qi–v" this–(H) “sand bank, beach shore,” which could be a later borrowing after /Å/ had become purely vocalic. Chantraine states that this–had “no etymology.” Frisk declares that it was “without satisfactory explanation,” and goes on to list some unlikely ones. The main difficulty with a derivation from tÅS+



198 BLACK ATHENA
is that this–was most frequently used in cases with a final -n, accusative thin–etc. In the Book of Coming Forth by Day (still widely known as Book of the Dead), tÅS=with a walking determinative indicated “to walk the bounds, fix the limits.” In Demotic tS=, probably pronounced *tåS,= meant “to define, arrange, assign.” In Coptic to\S,= also derived from tÅS=, signified “to limit, fix, assign, decide.” The Greek verb tavssw (5) means “to place, set in order, assign, prescribe.” The only problem arises from other forms of the verb from what appears to be root tag-. This root is linked to the word tagós “commander.” The confusion seems to have been of the type found in spoken English between “brought” and “bought.” A further complication comes from the Egyptian verb ts, jos–in Coptic with a meaning “marshall troops, order, arrange.”45 Thus, the two Egyptian verbs played important roles in the formation of tásso,–which is not only the semantic correspondence but also a phonetic irregularity in the Greek verb. Both Frisk and Chantraine are puzzled that the form is tásso–not *tavzw tázo,–which is to be expected from tag-. Both lexicographers agree that tásso–has no etymology. Since /Å/ was an extremely frequent letter in Egyptian, many possible and probable loans into Greek comes from words containing that letter. Many others will appear later in this chapter and in the volume as a whole.
RÖSSLER’S PROPOSAL. Rössler did not limit his radical approach based on comparative Afroasiatic to /Å/. He called for a reassessment of some other Egyptian “letters.” Other specialists in Egyptian language treat these reassessments with skepticism, just as they have reacted to his rigidity in refusing some of the conventional correlations.46 Nevertheless, one of his proposals fits very nicely with what I see as a pattern of loan
ing into Greek. Specifically, his claim that ß (N37), the sign conven
tionally rendered /S=/, was originally pronounced as /h°/ can be seen as part of this pattern. The Hebrew /S=/ was transcribed into Greek as cq, /khth/; sc, /skh/; sk, /sk/; or x, /ks/ and, finally, as simple s, s. There is no reason to suppose that the Egyptian /S=/ was treated very differently. In the Late Period, first /h/ and then /h°/ merged with/S=/.47 Ac
cording the Rössler’s student Frank Kammerzell, the first shift of ß
towards /S=/ took place during the Old Kingdom, that is, in the first half of the Third Millennium BCE.48 If this dating is correct, and it might well not be, loans in which the Egyptian /S=/ was rendered as c or k would



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 199
have occurred before the Indo-European speakers arrived in Greece; at the end of the ceramic periods, Early Helladic II, circa 2400, or Early Helladic III circa 1900 BCE. If such is the case, either they were part of the “pre-Hellenic” substrate or they were introduced into Minoan culture in the Early Minoan period and transmitted to Greece at some later stage. If the first hypothesis is correct, the problem arises that many such words would have been preserved, while the Indo-Hittite substrate has left little trace. An explanation for this situation could be the similarities between Indo-Hittite and Indo-European. These similarities would obscure borrowings from Indo-Hittites. In addition, these postulated Egyptian words tended to represent objects, concepts and processes that were underdeveloped or missing among the newcomers. Later renditions of
ß
could have been introduced to Greece and Greek directly or indirectly through Crete.
EGYPTIAN /S=/ INTO GREEK. As the correspondences /S=/ ß to c or k
are even more controversial than those from /Å/ to /r/ or /l/, I feel it necessary to provide a number of plausible examples. I shall start with those in which the Greek word begins with /k/. There is no difficulty with the alternation c/k. Attested loans from both the Egyptian and the
Semitic /h°/ are frequently rendered /k/ in Greek.49 Proposed etymologies in brackets are uncertain. 1. S=-k. S=Åw, “coriander”; korivannon (kovrion), Linear B, plural koria2dana. Chantraine and Frisk see this word as “Mediterranean.”
S=rˆ “son, lad”; S=rˆt “daughter, girl, maiden;” kovro", kou'ro" “lad, young man” and the feminine, “lass, young woman.” kovrh, kouvrh, Arkadian kovrFa Linear B, kowo, kowa but also kira “little girl.” For Chantraine, the “least improbable etymology” was from *korFo” *korwos
in the sense of “to nourish” and was parallel to the Armenian ser “race, descendants” or Lithuanian sarvas “armor, man at arms.” The long /ee/ or /e–/ in the Coptic S=er–e (S) and S=er–i (B) would seem to indicate an earlier stressed /u–/ for S=ri.j50 Vycichl reconstructs a form *S=o–ryat for S=rit.jVycichl did not consider Rössler’s reconstruction, which would have been **khöryat. A related word S=rr “young, junior” was borrowed into Greek as ceivrwn “inferior” (see below). S=rt “kind of grain” attested in the Late Egyptian S=rijt “barley”; kri–qhv (H) “barley.” Chantraine and Frisk see it as either a “traveling word” or a cognate with Anglo-Saxon grotan “groats.”



200 BLACK ATHENA
ci'dron (5) “fresh grain.” Chantraine, “no etymology”; Frisk, “probably a foreign word.” kavcru" (4) “grilled barley.” Chantraine links this to kevgcro" (H) “millet,” which he sees as a reduplication possibly linked by metathesis and a hypothetical form *kerkono *kerkonos to the Old High German hirso “millet.” WS=byt (5) “beads” o[kkabo" “bracelet.” Chantraine gives no etymology. 2. S=-c. S=Å “field, meadow, marsh swamp, country as opposed to town”; cwvra (H) “place, partly occupied, volume, contain, countryside.” Frisk links it to chvra (H) “widow” in the sense of “empty.”51 There may be some confusion of the two roots here. Chantraine’s student and successor Jean-Louis Perpillou, who prepared the last section of the Dictionaire, also tentatively invokes corov" (H) “place for dancing, chorus.”52 S+Å, with
a prothetic a-, was later borrowed as a[si" (H) “fresh mud” and (ajsio") as an epithet for leivmwn “meadow.”53 Chantraine states “unknown”; Frisk writes “not securely explained.” They both cite an improbable etymology from the Sanskrit asita- “dark.” S=Å only attested in Late Egyptian, “to go aground, founder,” coirav" (7) “reefs, promontaries and their vicinity.” Perpillou claims a common association of pigs (coi'roi) with rocks. Coi'ro" “pig” itself may come from yet another Egyptian S=Å “pig.”54 S=Å “to ordain, predestine”; Late Egyptian S=Åy “destiny”; Middle Egyptian S=Åw; Demotic, S=y; Coptic (S) S=ai “fate.” The indeclinable crhv (H) meant “necessity, obligation, duty.” creivwn (H) was “giving an oracle” and the stem crhs- (5) was concerned with truth and oracular responses “to enquire of an oracle.” Some of the forms, seen as derivatives of crh,v however, derive from an Egyptian cluster that appears to be related not only to S=Å “to ordain, predestine” but also to S=Åw “weight, worth, value”; S=Åwt “fitting things”; the phrase n-S=Åw “fit for, in the capacity of ” and S=Åyt “dues, taxes.” creivo" (H) and its compositions center on the concept of debt. creiva (6) meant “need” but also “service, employment” and the abstract crh'ma (H) “wealth, revenue.”55 Frisk emphasizes that the form of crhvwas unique and that the etymologies were completely hypothetical. Of those Frisk sets out, Perpillou prefers “despite the difficulties” linked to a root *gher found in the Latin hortor “he will want” and, ultimately, to caivrw “rejoice.”
S=Åˆ “bundle” S=Åyt “taxes, dues”; Late Egyptian S=ÅŒt “property” cavrth" (5) “roll of papyrus.”56 Chantraine insists that it is the roll, not the papy



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 201
rus, that is important in the Greek word. Like Frisk, he agrees that the word should be a loan from Egyptian. He continues, however, “this is not supported by any linguistic argument.” Rössler’s reconstruction has now provided one.
S=ÅŒ-m “from the beginning on”; crovno" (H) “time.” On its own, S=ÅŒ
means “beginning” and S=ÅŒ tÅ was a term for the creation of the earth. It is interesting to note that khronos was seen as the first principle before the creation, in the Sidonian cosmogony reported by Eudemus of Rhodes and in that of Pherecydes of Syros.57 After the end of the New Kingdom
S=Å Œ-m became S=Å Œ-n. Because of the ancient values required of /S=/ and /Å/, this cannot be the source of crovno" and the change must have taken place in Greek. There are many similar examples, take for instance, nm(w) > na'no" “dwarf.”58 The evidence on vocalization does not help this etymology in that the
Coptic value of S=Å Œ is S=a. All one is able to say is that a reconstruction of
S=Å Œ-m as *h°rŒo-m is possible as Œayin is often associated with back vowels. If there are problems with this Egyptian etymology, greater difficulties exist for those from Indo-European. The enthusiast for “Pelasgic” origins, A. J. Van Windekins, sees it as linked to keivrw “cut.”59 ChantrainePerpillou is scathing about this. According to them, this linkage “excludes in every way the definition reported above [Chantraine-Perpillou’s lemma] and the notion of constant duration.” Perpillou then speculates that it might be related to the Avestan zrvan “time duration” and concludes, “anyhow the etymology is unknown.” Frisk lists various etymologies without accepting any. S=w “emptiness, air.” S+w the god of air provides an excellent etymology for cavo" (H) “emptiness, infinite space.”60 In Egyptian cosmogonies S+w played a central role in the creation usually by separating earth from sky.61 In Hesiod’s Theogony Kháos was the first being or principle of the creation.62 Takács, who is generally skeptical of Rössler’s reconstructions, admits that the Arabic h°awiya “to be empty” provides a reasonable Semitic cognate for S=w.63 Chantraine and Frisk reasonably established that the root is *cav ̧o" *kháwos, which fits a derivation from S=w very well. They then go on to the much more dubious proposition of associating kháos with cauj`no" “ spongy, loose,” and metaphorically “empty, frivolous.” They place this with the Balto-Slav and Germanic cluster gaumen, “roof of the mouth” (our “gum”). S+rr “younger, small, lowly man” is clearly related to S+rij “lad,”



202 BLACK ATHENA
discussed above. The Greek ceivrwn “inferior in rank, strength or skill” is conventionally linked to the Sanscrit hrasva- “short, small.” Chantraine is not convinced and describes the etymology as “uncertain.” The number of variants suggests a loan. These include the epic cereivwn and the
Aeolic cevrrwn. The latter is interesting because of the double /rr/, which would seem to indicate preservation of an original S+rr. The final -o–n is simply a suffix of comparison.
ŒS=Å “many, numerous, plentiful, rich”; ŒS=Åt “the many, the masses.”
The term ŒS=Å-r “of mouth, loquacious” and ŒS=Å hr°w “noisy” suggest a swarm. Also, o[clo", okhlos (5) “crowd, mass, multitude, multiply, plentiful.”64 The vocalization of Œain in both Egyptian and Semitic was usually with the back vowels /o/and /u/. The pejorative use of oiJpollovi hoi
polloi “the many” would seem to be a calque from ŒS=Å. Chantraine, like Frisk, emphasizes the aspect of movement and agitation and associates it through a hypothetical * ̧oclo" with the Old Norse vagl “perch” and on to vog “lever,” suggesting motion. Frisk tentatively links this to movclo" (H) “lever.” This, however, has a better Egyptian origin in mh°Åt “balance.”65 Another Greek term for “multitude” is e[qno" (H) variant ojqnei'o". Chantraine defines ethnos more precisely as “a more or less permanent group of individuals, soldiers and animals, nation, class, caste.” It is distinguished from geno" “family, tribe.” Unlike these factually or fictitiously biological units, ethnos is an administrative classification or counting. The Egyptian tnw is a “number” or “numbering,” and tnwt is a census of “cattle, prisoners etc.” The probability of a form with prothetic vowel *itnw is increased by the existence of a Sahidic word ato “multitude.” Chantraine mysteriously proposes a stem *swedh, ultimately with the third-person pronoun eJ“he,” as the origin of this word.
To return to ŒS=Å, another later borrowing would seem to be ojceuvw (5) “to copulate, breed.” Chantraine cites Meillet as wanting to link this with ojcleuv", a derivative of okhlos. This linking seems reasonable through
ŒS=Å. Frisk says it is “debatable” that it is related either to ojcevomai“travel, ride” or is from the all-purpose etymon e[cw (in either of two particular senses: “to overpower, a bolt which goes into a hole in the wall[!]”).
ŒS=Å appears to have been transmitted into Greek at a later stage when the uncertain sibilant /S=/ was rendered cq rather than as /k/ or /c/. This provides a reasonable etymology for e[cqro"/e[cqo" “hatred, enemy.” Frisk and Chantraine derive these from ek, ek or the Latin extra “the man outside.” Both this and the Egyptian etymologies are possible,



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 203
but, rather than explain the alternation ékhthros/ékhthos (H) through the workings of the mysterious Caland’s “law,” it would seem better to see it as made up of borrowings from before and after /Å/ lost its consonantal value. From the sense of “plenty, rich” (which is dominant in its Semitic
cognates ŒoS=er and ŒåSî=r) appears to come ŒS=Åw with the Greek prefix eu“fortunate,” in the form eu[ocqo" (H) “rich, abundant.”66 Chantraine is not happy with an etymology from o[cqo" o[cqh (H) “mound, hill, river bank, growth, pustule.” Chantraine sees the final –the,–-thos in the words as common suffixes. The Greek word probably
derives from another Egyptian ŒS=Åw, tentatively translated “obnoxious,”
but written with the determinative a (Aa 2) “growth, pustule or gland.”67
The final fates of ŒS=Åt were the Coptic aS=ai, aS=e–“many, plentiful.” Still more reduced was Plutarch’s tentative report that the Egyptian word for “many” was os.68 Without an Indo-European etymology for okh-, one
from ŒS=Å would seem plausible if it came after the/Å/ had lost its value as a liquid.
As a further example of the correspondence ß-c, there is the ßnŒ “type of fish,” and cavnna (4) “sea perch.” The authority on Greek fish names, D’Arcy W. Thompson, suspected that this word had an Egyptian etymology but Chantraine denies it.69 Finally, there is the Egyptian ws+n “wring the neck of poultry” and the Greek aujchvn (H) “neck of men or animals” and aujcenivzw “break the neck of a victim.” Chantraine is skeptical of all previous efforts to explain the word in terms of Indo
European. As an example illustrating both S=-cq, and S=-x, we find mrS= Coptic mroS=“yellow/red dye, yellow ochre used for painting and dyeing.” Greece has the doublet movrocqo"/movroxo" (2CE) “white clay used for painting and dyeing.” Frisk argues that the alternation indicates a loan. Chantraine denies that, arguing, “this does not necessarily prove that it is a borrowing. For a parallel see the doublet ’Erecqeuv"/’Erecsev".” Chantraine takes it for granted that Erekhtheús, a founding hero of Athens, must have had a Greek name. I shall challenge this case and this assumption in Chapter 22.
EGYPTIAN M TO GREEK F. As mentioned above in regard to Semitic, interchanges between /m/ and /b/ were relatively common in Egyptian.70 The hesitation is not surprising, especially as Greenberg argued forcefully that there was a Proto-Afroasiatic “prenazalized voiced stop */mb/.” He also noted changes between Middle Egyptian /b/ and Coptic /m/.71 Similar alternations are found within Indo-European. Many



204 BLACK ATHENA
examples of roots found in Sanskrit with initial m- were rendered as bin Greek, especially before a liquid /r/ or /l/. See, for instance, the Greek brotós “mortal” and Sanskrit mr≥tá-h “dead” or the blítto–“get honey from a hive” and méli “honey.”72 Thus, it is not surprising that there are examples of Egyptian /m/ in initial or medial positions being rendered as /b/ in both Semitic and Greek.73 Turning for a moment to script, in Cadmean Letters I have argued that the Greek letter beta B does not derive from the Semitic bet /b/ but from the older “backed memB.74 The question remains whether one can go from such correspondences to argue for similar relationships between Egyptian /m/ and Greek /ph/. This involves considering the relationship between /b/ and /ph/. Acknowledged exchanges exist between /b/ and /p/ both within Egyptian and between Egyptian and Semitic.75 There are examples of an Egyptian initial b- being rendered in Greek as f ph. Similarly, medial -b- appeared as p /p/or f/ph/.76 It should be noted at this point, that it is unlikely that f always represented /ph/. The standard explanation for the letter f is that it was invented to provide a symbol for the sound /ph/ analogous to the use of the West Semitic emphatic dental tet for /th/, q theta. 77 My explanation, however, is quite different. I see the socalled “new letters” of the Greek alphabet f, c, y and W—those that did not exist in the Phoenician alphabet—as being in fact extremely old and coming from letters dropped from Canaanite as unnecessary after phonetic simplification. Specifically, I maintain that f derived from the old letter f, still attested in Ethiopic and representing an emphatic /q/. No matter whether it is glottalized or pharyngealized, any emphasis associates this velar with back vowels. Thus, just as happened with its deriva
tive Q in Etruscan and Latin, it was rendered /kw/ in Greek before the breakdown of the labiovelars.78 As labiovelars most frequently simply develarized to become labials, I argue that f became a spare labial that was eventually taken to represent the Greek aspirated /ph/.79 There is no way of telling how quickly this process took place and it is possible that some loans from Egyptian into alphabetic Greek were made before the identification between /ph/ and f was fixed. Moving away from alphabets to consider the phonetics themselves, further confusion between /ph/ and /b/ comes from the fact that the former derives from an allophone /bh/ from the Indo-European series II b/bh.80 Thus, Armenian and Macedonian cognates to Greek words with /ph/ are usually rendered as /b/.81 It is unclear when the voiced aspirated stops /bh/ and /gh/ were devoiced in Greek, but the example



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 205
of /th/, where the change had taken place, makes it likely that it was before the Mycenaean period.82 If exchanges between Egyptian /m/ and Greek /b/ were possible in later periods, those between /m/ and / bh/ before the shift bh>ph would be equally easy, especially as with the alternations m/b within Indo-European before a liquid /r/ or /l/. Even after that date, loans involving m>ph would seem quite possible.83 Here are some examples: mÅt “to proclaim, acclaim” in Later Egyptian and the Coptic meeue (S), meue (B) “to think, imagine”;84 fravzw (H) “to indicate, make oneself understood”; fravzomai“to think, imagine.” Chantraine, his student Olivier Masson and Frisk all tentatively derive these from a root *frad± and from this to frhvn conventionally seen as an “uncertain human organ, soul,” which itself has no Indo-European etymology.85 They make the connection by first supposing that the a i±n *frad±“ought” to be short.
They then propose that this sound derived from a vocalized /n/¢which
leads one to think of a zero degree *fra- of phren–, which had a dative plural form fras±i. After going through these convolutions, Masson describes this etymology as a “simple possibility, but semantically satisfying.”86 A slight phonetic problem exists with the Egyptian etymology in that I have found no example of final -t being rendered -d in Greek. On the other hand, all the dentals including -t and d tended to merge in later Egyptian. The Greek word has uncertainties with different dialect renditions of /z/, /sd/, /dd/ being given for the corresponding consonant. Nevertheless, this problem weakens the Egyptian etymology to make it merely “satisfactory”—three points for semantics and one for phonetics. mr “sick, diseased” found throughout Afroasiatic with the root *mar.87 An interesting Greek doublet illustrates the possibility of an interchange between m and ph: ajfaurov" (H) “phantom, the dead, enfeebled” and ajmaurov" (5) with the same meaning. The initial alpha can be explained as deriving from an unwritten prothetic ˆ-.88 Since a Coptic form is lacking, we have no indication of the vowel. mr “bind, weave?” mrw, mrt “weavers” and mrw “strip of cloth.” The word has deep roots in other branches of Afroasiatic, also, as *mar.89 In Greek there are favrai (5CE) “weave,” for which neither Chantraine nor his student Jean Taillardat provides an etymology, and fa'ro", pawea2
in Mycenaean “large piece of woven cloth, tunic without sleeves.” Frisk does not accept a weak link to the Lithuanian bùre% “sail” or bàrva “uniform color.” mrw from mrw “weavers,” to “serfs, lower classes,” also found as *mar



206 BLACK ATHENA
“slave” in Chadic.90 Chantraine (or Tailladat) sees the basic sense of fau'lo" (5) as “simple, ordinary, poor” leading on to “bad, lazy, etc.” There are some interesting parallel words: ajfelhv" (5) “simple, naive” and flau'ro" (6) “mediocre, insignificant, bad.” While the lexicographers reasonably see these words as related, Frisk and ChantraineTaillardat are unhappy with any of the proposed etymologies. The complexity of the cluster in itself suggests a loan and, if one accepts the correspondence m>ph, mrw provides a plausible etymology. This, mr “ill” could provide an etymology for the Latin malus, -a, um “bad, physical or moral.” Although they have found an Oscan cognate, Ernout and Meillet describe the etymology of malus as “uncertain.” mry/mrw. These words refer to unspecified types of wood, the Greek fellov" (6) “ivy, cork oak.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine-Taillardat accept the previous etymology from the Indo-European root *bhel “to blow up.” The double /ll/ presents a problem for both the Indo-European and the Egyptian etymologies. The same problem of doubling affects another possible Greek borrowing from mrw: filuvra (5) “linden or other light wood.” For this word neither Frisk nor Chantraine-Taillardat have any explanation. mrw “desert,” the Greek felleuv" (4). Frisk defines this word as “uneven, stony, soil,” Chantraine-Taillardat as garrigue or scrubland. Chantraine linked it to phellós because it is covered with scrub. All these scholars are skeptical of previous Indo-European etymologies. mrij “love, want, wish desire.” Vycichl accepts the possibility of Cerny’s proposal that this word derives from a metathesis from the Semitic root ÷r>m “love” since “the metathesis rm>mr is so common.” Cerny belonged to a generation that did not recognize the liquid value of /Å/, but his hypothesis is made more plausible by the Egyptian alternation ˆÅm=ˆmÅ “kind, gentle, pleasing, friendly lovable.” Another possibility would be to link mrˆ to the Afroasiatic root *mar “bind” mentioned above. On the basis of an analogy with the verb mise “give birth,” Vycichl reconstructs a verbal noun for mrˆ as first *miryat then *miryit. This provides a plausible etymology for the Greek fivlo", fivlw “love,” passive participle found in the Linear B pirameno “friend, love.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine saw any plausible Indo-European etymology for philo\. It is interesting to note that, like phílo,\ neither of the other Greek words for “love,” e[ramai (H) and ajgapavw (H), have accepted Indo-European etymologies and both possess plausible Afroasiatic ones. Eramai could well derive from the Egyptian ˆÅm mentioned above, with the root -m in



[CH. 8] PHONETIC CORRESPONDENCES 207
the Egyptian one being interpreted morphologically in the Greek. The derivation of agapáo\from Semitic has a long history.91 The predominant source has been seen as the standard Hebrew word for love >åhe\b and the noun >ahab±å. The latter was the always translated ajgavph in the Septuagint. In 1985, however, G. L. Cohen and J. Wallfield proposed a derivation from a much less frequently attested Hebrew form Œågab “sensuous love.”92 Phonetically, the fit with agapáo\ is better, but Saul Levin continues to prefer >åhe\b because of the rarity and irregularity of Œågab.93 The Indo-Europeanist Raimo Anttila recently tried to disregard the Semitic etymologies, although he admits, “the similarities are quite intriguing, but these formal problems do not overrule the solid IndoEuropean embedding in the social structure.”94 Anttila’s alternative is to revive an idea, explicitly denied by Chantraine, that the initial aga-, which Anttila takes to mean “drive, drove,” moves puzzlingly to family or social unit. A;gw is “to drive stock”; ajgov" is “chief ” and ajgwvn “the place driven to, assembly.” Extending the derivation on pseudo-social, rather than linguistic, grounds and from these to the family and social unit, let alone “caring,” is pushing too far. Additionally, in general, his vague and complex scheme, ranging from Welsh to Old Danish and Sanskrit, does nothing to remove the solid phonetic correspondence between Œågab and ajgapavw.95 What is more, Anttila’s attempt to make a semantic distinction between lust and love is equally unconvincing, when, among many other examples, the Greek e[rw" does precisely that.96
CONCLUSION
In this chapter I have argued that in certain ways one can go beyond the phonetic limits on proposed borrowings set out in correspondences established by Greek transcriptions of Egyptian and Semitic words and proper nouns and in the loans accepted by cautious and conservative scholars (seen in appendices A and B). The renditions of two of the Egyptian phonemes /Å/ and /S=/ can be loosely tied to specific periods. Before 1400 BCE /Å/ was a liquid /r/ or /l/; after that time it was a vocalic modifier. Until around the middle of the Third Millennium, /S+/ sounded as a /kh/ or /k/; after that time it was /khth/, /skh/, /sk/, /ks/ and, eventually, /s/. Such correspondences with Greek also occur for the Hebrew /S=/in the later period. The occasional rendering of Egyptian /m/ as Greek /ph/ is more difficult to periodize. The only other extension to the limits I impose on myself is that of the possibility of



208 BLACK ATHENA
metathesis of a liquid /r/ or /l/ between the second and third places in a root. This I believe is justifiable because it is so common in all three languages: Egyptian, West Semitic and Greek. I do not accept other metatheses, not because they have not occurred but because if I were to accept them anything becomes possible and rules, regularities and constraints are essential to any project of this kind.

INTRODUCTION
T
his chapter deals with some Egyptian particles and reduced nouns that integrated with the nouns or verbs they were modifying to the extent that they were taken into Greek as simple words. English shows a similar pattern of borrowing. By far the most common derive from Arabic words beginning with the definite article >al: alchemy, alcohol, alcove, alfalfa, algebra, algorithm, alkali and almanac. With the assimilation of >al others, such as “assegai” and “aubergine,” can also be found. The first sections of this chapter treat the Egyptian definite articles. The development of pÅ, tÅ and nÅ n(y) was described above in Chapter 6.1 They were introduced from the southern dialect of Thebes, which became the national spoken language around the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty in the sixteenth century BCE. Northern Middle Egyptian remained the written standard. The situation in Late Egyptian became more complicated because of the development of three related paradigms. The first of these was as follows:
Coptic Late Egyptian Accented Unaccented pÅy pai peitÅy tai teinÅy nai neinÅ

PREFIXES, INCLUDING THE DEFINITE

210 BLACK ATHENA
These were stronger or more deictic than the articles, but unlike pn, tn, nn n(y) they were placed before the modified word not after it. In addition, pÅw may be another form of pÅy. The second paradigm is of the possessive article, which was also placed before the word it modified:
Late Egyptian Coptic
pÅy.f potÅy.f tonÅy.f no
The third paradigm involves words meaning “he, she, they of ”:2
Late Egyptian Coptic
p(Å) -n pÅ pa t(Å) -nt tÅ ta nÅy nÅ na
With all these preposed articles it is not surprising that there were many different Greek renderings from the Egyptian. As the masculine gender gained on the feminine in Late Egyptian there are many more examples of transcriptions or accepted loans from pÅ and its variants than there are from tÅ and nÅ n(y).3 These loans are p, pa, pe, pi, and po; phe and ph. The last were usually, but not always, in the neighborhood of a laryngeal. /b/ and /ph/ can be added, if one accepts other correspondences with Egyptian p.4 Under the heading of the prefixes, Egyptian words will generally be ordered according to the Egyptological “alphabet”: Å, ˆ, Œ, w, b, p, f, m, n, r, h, h≥, h,° h, s, s +, q, k, g, t, t, d, d. This order will also be used in later chapters.

ˆwn mwt f “pillar of his mother.” This could be interpreted as “support of his mother.” Another title given to the god Min, KÅ mwt f “bull of his mother” suggests that it may mean something rather different.
*pÅ ˆwntyw “the tribesman, bowmen” Paivone" (H) “people living to the north of Greece,” that is, in Thrace and later in Macedonia. The form ˆwntyw provides a plausible origin for [Iwne" Ionians.6
*pÅ ˆm “the groan” Pa–vn. See the discussion in Volume II.7
*pÅ ˆn “the fish” pavn (2CE) “Nile fish.” Thompson in A Glossary of Greek Fishes is quite clear about this Egyptian derivation.8
*pÅ ˆty “the sovereign” bavtto" (5CE) “ruler of Libya.” Chantraine states that this word comes from a “Mediterranean base.”
*pÅ ˆd “the child “pai'", paidov" (H). Julius Pokorny sees pai as derived
from an Indo-European root *po–u-, pEu-, pu\v- “small, few.”9 The English word “few” itself comes from it. Pokorny, Frisk and Chantraine—basing themselves on a name Pau" found on a vase and a Cypriot inscription with the name Filopa ̧o"—have hypothesized a stem *pa ̧ id and see it as linked with a zero grade to the Sanskrit putra and the Oscan puklum “son.” The linguist G. Neumann, however, challenged the idea that the digamma in these cases belonged to the root.10 If Neumann were followed, the whole etymology would collapse. There is a further difficulty in the lexicographers’ inability to explain the -i- in *pa ̧ id, and even the final -d presents problems. Nevertheless, irregularities of accentuation in the declension of paîs indicate that it was, indeed, originally disyllabic. As argued in Chapter 5, however, digamma does not provide the only reason for this and loan words containing œayin or even >aleph can produce the same effect. Thus, paîs, paidós would fit well with *pÅ ˆd. The Egyptian word ˆd appears to derive from a form *ild. The word “lad” cannot be traced beyond Middle English. One possibility is that it is the only remnant in Indo-European of a Nostratic root. A further link
is that the biliteral ÷ld with a voiceless fricative velar prefix ky[h] occurs in the Egyptian hrd “child” and in the Teutonic, especially the Gothic kilthei “womb,” the Anglo-Saxon cild [“child”], German and Dutch kind.11 In any event, the root *wld “to give birth, child” is well established in Afroasiatic. It is found throughout Semitic and in Lowland East Cushitic.12



212 BLACK ATHENA
The initial consonant was unstable. It was /w/in early Akkadian, Arabic and Ge>ez, /y/ in Amorite, Ugaritic and Canaanite, and >aleph in later Akkadian. The last also appears to be the case in Egyptian. Scholars
have long puzzled over the nature of the reed >aleph ˆi. Within Afroasiatic
it generally corresponds to >aleph >a or yod *y.13 In a number of cases, however, it corresponds to *l or *r. In the vast majority of these the /ˆ/ is initial.14 Carleton Hodge argued cogently that this indicates that /ˆ/ never
corresponded to a liquid in the way that a the “vulture >aleph” did, but
that in these cases the ˆ- was prothetic and the intervening liquid was dropped. The classic case was the Egyptian ˆb from an original Afroasiatic *lb(b) “heart” via *ilb. The same took place with ˆd from *ild or *iÅd.15 Id “child, boy” appears borrowed into Greek in a number of ways. First, there is i[dio" (H) “simple, inexperienced, common man, individual.” Chantraine is clearly uncertain about its etymology. He reconstructs on the basis of an Argive inscription * ̧h édios. He sees * ̧h é- as the old Greek third person pronoun, hé “enlarged by a -d-. Chantraine sees an association with the Sanskrit vi “separate” as “less probable.” A second probable borrowing is aji?ta–" (5) “beloved youth.” This is generally thought to be Dorian but Chantraine demonstrates that it was also used in other parts of Greece. He describes the etymology as “uncertain” but refers to a proposal to derive it from ajivw “listen.” Then there is hji?qeo" (6) “celibate young man.” Chantraine’s uncertainty about the origin of this word is indicated by his statement that it is “legitimate to look for an Indo-European etymology for such an archaic word.” He then refers to a derivation from the Indo-European root found in the Sanskrit vidháva–and to words in many other languages including the English “widow.” The idea is the common notion of separation found in both celibacy and widowhood. In Linear B, the sign DE is used as an adjunct to the sign WOMAN to signal girls or boys.16 This sign would seem to be an early version of the suffixes -id and -iad and the patronymic -iavde" or -ivde". Generally, -id and -iad are used in the plural, as in Nhrhivde" Nereíds and Druvade" Dryvads “children of.” Despite their plausible Egyptian origin, these suffixes were “alive” in Greek and could be applied to roots of different origins. In these examples they were Semitic and Indo-European.17 There are also difficulties on the Egyptian side. There is no trace of id being used as a suffix or patronymic in Egyptian. Nevertheless, these etymologies from -d are plausible enough to strengthen that of paîs, paidós from *pÅ ˆd.



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 213
Against this etymology is the typological argument that “child,” as a fundamental term, is unlikely to be borrowed.18 An apparent further difficulty is that, while pÅ, as the definite article, is the defining feature of Late Egyptian, the word ˆd is not attested in that stage of the language, when it was replaced by hrd.19 Even so, the recurrence of archaisms is a common feature of Egyptian. The chances in this case are increased by the fact that ˆd appears in the Book of Coming Forth by Day, the most frequently reproduced collection of texts during the New Kingdom and the Late Period. Taking all this into account, the semantic and the phonetic correspondences between paîs, paidós and *pÅ ˆd remain more plausible than those of any of the etymology’s Indo-European competitors. Not only is the Egyptian derivation stronger semantically but it can also explain, in a way that the other hypotheses cannot, the final -d and the preceding -i-.
*pÅ ŒmŒm “the container for bread etc.” pw'ma (H) “cover of a jar or box.” Chantraine associates this form with the Sanskrit patr–a etc. “receptical” and the Gothic fodr “sheath.” On balance, the Egyptian etymology appears superior.
*pÅ Œrq “the basket” povrko" (4) “wicker fish trap.” Frisk and Chantraine relate this form to the Armenian ors “hunt,” hence, to a hypothetical Indo-European *porkos “hunt, prey.” Ors could derive from many other roots, and the semantic parallel is far less precise than that of the Egyptian etymology.
*pÅ Œh≥Åwt(y) Late Egyptian, Demotic h≥wt(y), Coptic hout “warrior, male, man,” fw'", fwtov" (H) “man, hero, mortal.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine can explain this word in Indo-European terms. Jernstedt proposed this powerful Egyptian etymology in 1953.20
pÅ wŒb Coptic peiuop, uab “the pure, the clean,” X (D60) “priest”
TM (A6) foi'bo" (H) “pure of water, bright, luminous, epithet of Apollo.”
The association with pure water is reflected in the Hymn to Delian Apollo: after his birth “straightway, great Phoibos, the godesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water.”21 Hesiod also has an uncertain fragment: “He brought pure water [foi'bon u[dwr] and mixed it with Ocean’s streams.”22 K. O. Müller, saw phoibos as “golden haired” of “unstained



214 BLACK ATHENA
purity.”23 Discounting the “golden haired,” Müller was clearly right about the purity.24 (The origin of the name Apollo from the Egyptian H°prr is discussed in Chapter 19 below.) We have encountered, and shall en
counter below, other examples of the Egyptian /w/, /wœ/or rounded consonants being rendered as -oi- in Greek.25 For the present I simply offer the examples of oijh (4) “village” from wœrt “administrative division, quarter” and oi\bo" (2CE) a butchery term for the “back of a bull’s neck” from wœbt “meat offering.” As neither Frisk nor Chantraine can provide an etymology for phoîbos, its Egyptian etymology is virtually certain.
pÅ mr “the pyramid” mr written with = (o.24), puramiv" (5). Frisk and
Chantraine follow the conventional etymology from puramou'" “wheat cakes, in the shape of pyramids,” based on purov" “wheat,” developed into pyramís by analogy to shsamiv" se\samís “sesame.” It is inherently more likely that the cakes were named after the ancient pyramids rather than the reverse. While the metathesis m/r required for the Egyptian etymology is generally accepted, the formation may have been influenced by purov". However, a rendering of the Demotic pÅ rmt, Coptic p(i)ro–me “the (noble) man” as pivrwmi" probably played a greater role in the metathesis.26
*pÅ nwy Coptic panau “the waters, the flood.” buvnh (3) “sea” was also a name of ’Inwva fierce goddess whose worship was associated with the sea, lakes and ponds.27 Her name, unexplained in Indo-European terms, may well come from a prothetic formation *ˆnwy “waters, flood.” The hydronyms, Phneiov" and Feneov", are discussed in Volume 2.28
*pÅ nr(t) “the vulture” fhvnh (H) “large rapacious bird consecrated to Athena.” Nrt was originally feminine, but it was written nr in Demotic and nure in Coptic. It was predominantly masculine in the latter. The
phonetic correspondence with phe\nve is good; the -r was weak in Coptic and would have been dropped as a final from Greek. The stressed long /u–/ developed from a Late Egyptian long /a–/.29 In Ionic Greek this vowel would have developed into /e–/. The semantic match is perfect. The rapacious vulture was sacred to Neit, the counterpart of Athena. Frisk and Chantraine admit that they cannot provide a persuasive ety
mology for phe\nve. They tentatively suggest that it may have been “white bird” and postulate an Indo-European root *bhea-s found in the Sanskrit bhasati “shine.”30



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 215
*pÅ rw “the lion” Phleuv", Phleivwn, Phlhiavdh". In Chapter 6, I accepted William Albright’s suggestion that stressed /u–/ became -eubefore shifting on to /e–/.31 This shift would explain the derivation of the Greek levwn, levonto" rewo(pi) in Linear B from the Egyptian rw. Chantraine denies the Indo-European proposals; both he and Frisk reject any Semitic etymologies, although they accept the derivation of li'" (H) “lion” from the Canaanite layis. Thus, they see léo\n as a borrowing from an unknown source. Significantly, neither the lexicographers nor Gamkrelidze and Ivanov mention the fact that the derivation of léo\n from rw was accepted by their scholarly ancestors, Theodor Benfey and George Curtius.32 The Greek adoption of Afroasiatic terms for “lion” is all the more remarkable given the fact that lions were native and not exotic around the Aegean. Strictly speaking, Pe–leús was Akhilles’ father. However, there is considerable confusion with the hero himself who is most frequently named Pe–le–iáde–s “son of the lion.”33 He is also often referred to directly as Pe–le–íon.34 Other heroes, too, are referred to as lions but with Akhilles the similes are more elaborate and forceful. He is noted not merely for his speed, quick temper and violence—“shaggy breast”—but for skulking in his tent or lair. The leonine image comes out most vividly in the passage in Book 20.35 The lexicographers state about the name Akhilles “etymology unknown.”
The final -leuv" could possibly also derive from rw. The initial Acicould be the common West Semitic initial >ahi°- (>åh≥i in Hebrew) “my brother (is).” This etymology “my brother is a lion” would, therefore, have to be bilingual, Semitic-Egyptian. But, given the leonine associations of Pe–leús, Pe–leío–n and Pe–le–iáde–s, it should not be ruled out. In addition, >ah°“brother” is used in many wider senses including that of “political allies.” Thus, >a–h°e–i, the construct plural “brothers,” provides a plausible etymology for the name used in Hittite texts for some peoples to their west, the Ah°hi°yawa–. With the Greek plural marker -oi, it gives a name for the ’Acaioi,v Akhaeans “the allies.”36
*pÅ rm “the fish” phlamuv" (4) and prhmnav" (4) “young tuna.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine can find an etymology for these words and Chantraine sees pel\amysvas a loan. There is also peirhvn (1) “a fish.” Frisk does not include this word and Chantraine provides no etymology. Because of later geographical distribution, Thompson “suspects” that pel\amysvis Asiatic.37



216 BLACK ATHENA
*pÅ rmn “the shoulder” Greek prumnov" (H) “shoulder or base.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine can provide an Indo-European etymology. The lexicographers even have trouble explaining its semantic field. Chantraine writes “what is at the extremity for body parts said of the extremity attached to the trunk.” This is difficult to reconcile with the idea of “base.” The situation is still further complicated by other words that are clearly related. There is prevmnon prémnon “base of a tree or pillar.” Even more puzzling to the lexicographers is pruvmnh “poop deck.” Like the others it has no Indo-European etymology. The idea of a shoulder as a base or support is not hard, but even the “poop” is easily explained using an Egyptian etymology. Rmn “shoulder” has the extended meaning of “porter” and “support, pillar.” It was also used for a processional shrine carried on the shoulders. We know that such portable shrines were frequently placed on the poop decks of ships. There are in fact splendid illustrations of such shrines on the Egyptian-style boats painted in the seventeenth-century BCE frescoes at Thera.38
*pÅ rn “the name” Coptic ran or ren, the Greek frhvn (H) “spirit, group of organs in the upper part of the body.”39 As mentioned in Chapter 8
in the discussion of phrázo\, phre\nvlacks an Indo-European etymology. Before discussing the semantic issues behind this identification of *pÅ rn
with phre\nv, it would seem useful to clear away phonetic problems. There is, as seen earlier in this chapter, attestation for pÅ being rendered with the letter phi. As for the phr- there is no record of pÅ having been rendered *pr, although it is likely that /Å/ continued to have consonantal value for sometime after the development of the definite article. As with
the /r/ in prymnós, that in phre\nvcomes from the initial r- in the word, rn or *ran. The vowel /e–/ in the singular and /e/ in the plural phrénes provide no difficulty.40 The semantic correspondence, too, is much less problematic than it might initially appear. Names were essential in Ancient Egyptian culture. There was, in Saussurian terms, a merging of the signifier and the signified. The rn of a man participated in his being and was a manifestation of his being, parallel to the body. It was sometimes identified with the kÅ (which will be discussed in Chapter 10). It was particularly important because rn could survive the death of the body and insure immortality.41
The standard text on phre\nvcited by classicists is that of R. B. Onians, The Origins of European Thought: About the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate. Onians argues, against Plato, Hippocrates and others who



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 217
identified phre\nvwith the diaphragm, that the phre\nves (the term was more commonly used in the plural in Homer) should be identified the lungs. He agreed with conventional scholars that the word meant “wits” or was the seat of intelligence and feeling, but for him the basis was physiological.42 I agree with Onians that the plurality of the term is significant but I disagree with his choice of organs. I shall argue in Chapter 11 that the paired seat of intelligence was the kidneys and that phre\nes should be identified with the Latin re\ne\s “kidneys,” which has no Indo-European etymology. It comes from rn without the article.43 In any event I maintain that Onians had got hold of the wrong end of the stick, but to make my case I have to go on to the next etymology.
*pÅ Åbˆ “the wish, the desire.” As a verb, Åbˆ meant “desire, long for” or “love.” *Rby “love, want, wish” has deep roots in Afroasiatic.44 For prapiv" (H) “spirit, seat of intelligence, desire, shrewd devices” the only IndoEuropean etymology is one proposed by Szemerényi. He reconstructs a hypothetical form *pr≥kw-i, a derivative of *perkus “rib,” i.e. “something connected to the rib hence the diaphragm and even the intelligence.”45 Apart from the far-fetched semantics, Pokorny’s reconstructed IndoEuropean root *perk{“rib” could not have been a labiovelar. In this case, Chantraine is much wiser to leave it “without an etymology.” As with phrénes, Onians maintained, against conventional wisdom that the prapivde" signified the diaphragm, that they referred to the lungs.46 These plausible Egyptian etymologies indicate to me that despite the undoubted great importance of lungs and breath as symbols of life in all cultures and the frequency of the plural forms of the Greek words in both cases, uncertainty about the organ indicates a spirit looking for physical site rather than a physical organ being seen as the source of the spirit. Why should Onians have put things the other way around? I believe that, despite his many references to analogies from other cultures including that of Egypt, Onians saw, as is indicated by the title of his book, that Greek and European thought was essentially autochthonous, arising in an “anthropological” way from simple notions of the body. He explicitly compares Homeric emotional images to “Levy Bruhl’s analysis of ‘primitive’ thought.”47 On the other hand, I see Greek culture as a recasting of elements of the sophisticated Egyptian, Levantine, and Mesopotamian civilizations.
*pÅ rqw “the opponent, the enemy” was rendered in Greek in two ways:



218 BLACK ATHENA
1. Flevguai (H) or Flevgue" (6) an early people, called Flevgra, who lived in Thrace and the Chalcidian peninsula. The conventional etymology is from a widespread Indo-European root *bhel “bright, fiery” found in the Greek flevgw “light, inflame.” The Phleguai were supposedly called this because they were so violent. This explanation is certainly possible but one can be more precise. Joseph Fontenrose demonstrated that the Phleguai were predominantly portrayed as enemies of Apollo and Delphi.48 Thus, *pÅ rqw provides a more plausible alternative derivation. The Phleguai were closely associated with the Lapithai; the Egyptian origin of this name will be discussed below along with the presence of Egyptian toponyms in Thrace and elsewhere in the northern Aegean.49 2. Phlagovn (H) and Phlagovne" a fierce hero and a people from Macedonia, enemies of Achilles and the Greeks. Kallimakhos praises Zeus as Phlagovnwn ejlath'ra “router of Pelagonians.”50
*pÅ hnw “the hnw, jar, measure of 1/2 liter” banwtov" (3) “vase, utensil of measure.” Chantraine sees -tós as a suffix for a container. He sees bano\ tós as a probable loan. Frisk believes it is possibly Egyptian.
*pÅ h≥m n St “the priest of Isis” fennh'si"- (1) “priest of Isis.” Chantraine agrees that this word is Egyptian.
*pÅ har “the sack, leather bag” phvra “leather bag.” Neither Frisk nor
Chantraine can provide an etymology for pe\rva.
*pÅ sÅb “the dappled, multicoloured plumage” yavr (H) “starling, speckled.” Loprieno points out that in the First Millennium BCE the Egyptian /b/ was probably “articulated as a fricative /b/.”51 It was, therefore, vulnerable in the final position. The derivations of qrivon “fig leaf ” from dÅbw “figs, foliage” and of ejlegaivein “mourn, wail” from ˆÅkb “mourn, wail” also illustrate this vulnerability. The etymology of psar indicates that the Greek shift s>h antedated the disappearance of the consonantal /Å/. This will be seen in other examples.52 Neither Frisk nor Chantraine accept any etymology for psar. 53
*pÅ sbt “the wall, fort” Coptic Psabet Ywfiv", Yafiv". These are city names in Arkadia and Zakynthos; see Chapter 20.54



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 219
*pÅ smÅ “the attachment” pei'sma (H) “stern cable with which a ship was made fast to the land” peismavtion (2) “umbilical cord.” Chantraine states that this word is “certainly” from a hypothetical *penqsma, which comes from the Indo-European root *bhend found in the Sanskrit bhadhnami and the Germanic bind. The semantics of these two derivations are equal, but the Egyptian phonetic relationship is far more direct. Peîsma should join prúmne\as examples of the many Egyptian nautical terms found in Greek; see Chapter 16 below.
*pÅ smyt “the desert” yavmaqo" (H) “sand” smyt “the desert” would appear to be the origin of a[maqo" (H) “sand or dust.” Both Frisk and Chantraine see a[mmo" (4) “sand” as a later derivation of ámathos. Frisk links the original form “probably with breathing changes” to the Middle High German sampt “sand.” Chantraine states that the coincidence of the form in two languages does not establish an Indo-European root. He sees ámathos and yavmmo" (5) “sand, dust” as belonging to two separate stems that have influenced each other’s development. I believe that the concidence of sound and meaning in these two words is too great to ignore. It would seem simpler to postulate a loan from smyt. Before the Greek shift s>h smyt produced ámathos and after it resulted in psámathos. An alternative would be from *pÅ smyt. Two difficulties with the latter alternative are, first, smyt is feminine and should take the feminine article (tÅ) and, second, smyt is not attested in Late Egyptian when definite articles first came into use. Regarding the first objection, the masculine singular article used with words previously seen as feminine or plural has been mentioned above.55 As for the second, it is always dangerous to rely on absence from a limited corpus and smyt is abundantly attested in Middle Egyptian texts from the New Kingdom. Even with its disadvantages the Egyptian etymology remains superior to the confusion of the Indo-European derivations.
*pÅ snw, sny “the food offerings” basuniva" (3) a type of cake offered at Delos. Frisk and Chantraine describe this word as probably a loan. The cult of Apollo at Delos had strong Egyptian associations. (See chapters 18 and 19 below.56) The derivation of Basynías from pÅ snw provides a parallel rendition of pÅ for ba to that of basileuv", from pÅ sr discussed in the next section.
pÅ sr in Akkadian transcription pa-si-i-a-(ra) “the official, vizier” basileuv" (Linear B) qa/pa2 sireu, pasilewose in the Cypriot syllabary, “high



220 BLACK ATHENA
official.” There can be no doubt that basileuv" is a borrowed term. In addition to the fact that it has no Indo-European cognates, it cannot be Indo-European, or from any substrate, because of the extreme rarety of initial /b-/ and because the /-s-/ between vowels became -h- in Greek sometime before 1500 BCE. The word must, therefore, have originated after that date. I shall argue later in this section that the borrowing came
after the labiovelars /kw/ and /gw/ broke down sometime later. As Frisk puts it, in his entry on the word: “beyond basileuv", there are two further Greek words for “king, lord,” the certainly inherited koivrano" the unexplained and probably foreign a[nax. Of these, basileuv", is the youngest.” The fact that at least two of the key Greek titles for chief or king are non-Indo-European is something that should give pause to defenders of the Aryan Model. I shall propose an Egyptian etymology for ánax in Chapter 10 and I express doubts about the Indo-European origin of koíranos in Chapter 14. Nevertheless, Frisk was clearly correct in his suggestion that basileús was the latest introduction. As mentioned in Chapter 7, it is interesting to note that Greek does not contain the Indo-European root derivative of *req “right”; *re–q-s, as is found in the Latin rex, the Irish ri, the Gothic reiks and Indian raj.57 The first person who, to my knowledge, proposed an etymology for basileús from the Egyptian pÅ sr “the official” was the Romanian scholar Dr. Constantin Daniel. He made this proposal in 1971 without the help of the Akkadian transcription pa-si-i-a-(ra) but also without the complication, discussed below, that John Chadwick no longer saw the Mycenaean form of basileuv" as pa2sireu but as qasireu.58 I knew from the title of his
article that Daniel had proposed an etymology for basileuv" but I did not know what it was, until 2002. I developed the same derivation independently in the early 1980s.59 Jasanoff and Nussbaum strongly objected to my derivation of the Greek basileús from pÅ sr even though, as mentioned above, we know that it was vocalized pasiyara in the thirteenth century BCE.60 The two authors appeared to have no difficulty with the semantics of this etymology. In both New Kingdom Egypt and contemporary Late Mycenaean Greece the word appears to have meant “high official,” rather than the later Greek “king.” Jasanoff and Nussbaum object to the phonetics. In the first place, they state that “the Egyptian p is never represented as a b in uncontroversial loan words.”61 The unreliability of the distinction between voiced and unvoiced stops in Egyptian was discussed in Chapter



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 221
8. Specifically, in the case of the labials, we know that the Egyptian city name Pr wÅ was rendered Bouto–and the Egyptian God >Inpw was Anubis to the Greeks.62 The two Indo-Europeanists further objected to my claiming that pÅ followed by an /s/ could be *bas- because, they argue, the succeeding unvoiced /s/ would have prevented voicing the initial p-. It is true that in all acknowledged loans, pÅ-s- appears as ps in Greek. In the list in this chapter, however, there are two other plausible examples: *pÅ snw/ basunías and *pÅ sts/bastázo.–I these examples the p-, or rather the indeterminate labial, was separated by a vowel and became voiced.63 The most serious objection made by Jasanoff and Nussbaum is that basileus is written qasireu in Linear B. That is to say, the initial is a labiovelar /kw/ rather than a labial /p/. No doubt the sign transcribed in Linear B as /q/ represented a labiovelar when the script was first devised, during or before the seventeenth century BCE. At the other end, the poems of Hesiod and Homer indicate that the labiovelars had completely broken down before they were composed in the tenth and ninth centuries. John Chadwick wrote about this, “the pronunciation of the labiovelars remains a matter of conjecture, but the consensus of opinion favors their retention in Mycenaean.”64 Szemerényi expressed still more uncertainty when he wrote “a much more difficult question is whether the sounds so denoted were still labiovelars [when the texts were written].”65 When the surviving Linear B tablets were written is still uncertain. Some may have been produced as early as the seventeenth century. I accept the case made by Palmer and Niemeier that most of the tablets date from the end of the thirteenth century.66 No one now seems to doubt that the labiovelars in front of /u/ and /y/ had been delabialized to become ku and ky before the thirteenth century.67 Szemerényi maintains that the labiovelars broke down at different times not as a uniform set. Specifically, he argues that by the time of the tablets the labiovelars before /e/ and /i/ had palatalized and begun the process that ended in their becoming te and ti.68 This argument leaves the problem of dating the labialization before /a/ and/o/
to become pa and po. No one doubts that Kwo could be written as po when another labiovelar was in the same word. Chadwick, who made this point, adds, “the pronunciation of a labiovelar before a consonant is surprising, but q is regularly written in this position.”69 These patterns suggest that the breakdown of all the labiovelars was taking, or had taken, place by the fourteenth century. Nevertheless, as stated above, the consensus



222 BLACK ATHENA
among Mycenologists is that the original /kw/ was still present in the thirteenth and twelfth centuries. The bases for this judgment, however, are very slight. The survival of labiovelars, or their “unorthodox” reflexes in later Greek dialects, tells us nothing about the date of their breakdown in the standard language represented in Linear B. Lejeune has shown that the Linear B sign for a labiovelar before /o/ is the same as that in *equos (“horse”) where the kw is not a labiovelar. This discovery suggests that the Linear B sign qo was
pronounced Kwo . It could, however, merely reflect an earlier situation before the spelling convention was established. Furthermore, the Linear B texts contain two possible cases of early labialization. There is no evidence about qa specifically. Ventris and Chadwick initially read qa as a labial pa2, but, as mentioned above, Chadwick later retracted this reading.70 Even if one accepts Chadwick’s discrediting of his and Ventris’s
earlier interpretation, that qa was heard as kwa in the fourteenth century is not established. Lejeune argued that the lack of alphabetic letters to represent the labiovelars demonstrates that these sounds had disappeared before the alphabet’s establishment, which he, following conventional wisdom, took to be in the eighth century BCE.71 Today, however, transmission of the alphabet from the Levant to Greece is dated either to the eleventh century or, as I claim, to between 1800 and 1400 BCE.72 Accepting these dates would indicate that labiovelars had disappeared by the eleventh century or the middle of the Second Millennium. The situation is further complicated—in my disfavor—because I maintain that the letter phi (f) originated from a Semitic qup (f) and was used to represent labiovelars before their breakdown.73 Nevertheless, neither Hesiod nor Homer show a trace of the labiovelars. These poets not only lived in the tenth and ninth centuries BCE, but—if I am right on the introduction of the alphabet—were also following spelling conventions that went back to the Bronze Age. Thus, their dialects had lacked labiovelars for some considerable time. Jasanoff and Nussbaum still claim “that there is no empirical support for his [my] assertion that the PIE labiovelars had already broken down in Linear B.” They dismiss my arguments simply on the grounds that “not a single instance is known in which the labiovelar signs are used to write a demonstrably old labial, or in which labial signs are used to write a demonstrably old labiovelar.” I have never questioned the fact that no labials with demonstrable Indo-European etymologies have been writ



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 223
ten with labiovelars. Jasanoff and Nussbaum, however, are being disingenuous here.74 As stated above, examples exist of labiovelars before u and y having been delabialized to become a velar k.75 Jasanoff and Nussbaum also relegate to a footnote an alternation ke/pe, which they explain in the orthodox way as a develarization resulting from two labiovelars being in one term.76 To repeat my argument, the labiovelars could have broken down in speech while still being preserved in writing. If this happened, the sign qa would have been an alternative to pa during the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries BCE and the Egyptian title pasiyara could have been pronounced *pasireu in the Aegean but written *qasireu. It is quite frequent, if not normal, in languages like Japanese or Hebrew for the less common sign—or sign system—to be used to represent a foreign loan word.77 All in all, I do not accept that the conventionally sanctioned speculation that the labiovelars were intact in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries BCE is sufficient to dismiss the plausible etymologies. Later chapters will present etymologies of loan words and place names that become possible when one accepts the labialization of qa> pa by this time. A example of this can be found in the river name Qamisijo, which Chadwick reasonably linked to the Pamissos river in Messenia. This derivation has a plausible etymology from the frequent Egyptian toponyme and toponomic element PÅ mw, “the water,” referring to rivers and tributaries of the Nile.78 The problem of the final -eu(s) in qasireu /basileus can be solved relatively easily. The origin of the suffix -eus was discussed in Chapter 6.79 The suffix has been reconstructed specifically on the word sr “official.” The Egyptologists Adolf Erman and Elmar Edel see the full reading of it as sirw or sriw.80 Thus, the final -sileus could come directly from sirw or simply as sil and the Greek suffix eus.81 The case for deriving qasireu / basileus from pasiyara +w is particularly attractive because of its semantic excellence and because all other attempts to find the source have failed spectacularly. After listing some speculation Frisk wrote, “so basileuv" must still always be considered, at least in detail, as an unclear foreign word.” As Chantraine put it, “It is useless to look for an etymology of basileuv".”
p(e)siur (Coptic) “the eunuch” yi–lov" (H) “bald, hairless, smooth” Yivlax (2CE) an epithet of Dionysos. Where basileús went up in the world from “high official” to “king,” in Egypt sr Coptic siur went down to become a more general word for eunuch. As such, it was again borrowed



224 BLACK ATHENA
into Greek and again with the definite article found in Coptic texts as either pesiur or psiur. In this last form it was introduced into Greek as ps iló–s “bald, hairless, smooth,” the characteristics of a eunuch. Chantraine and his pupil Perpillou associate it with yi–vw “to nourish or feed a baby,” for which they have no etymology. There are also other related forms, yednov" “sparse or rare of hair” which Chantraine plausibly links to ps il|ós; the yivlino" stevfano" was a crown of twigs for young naked boys in Sparta. Finally, there is Psílax, an epithet of Dionysos, which would fit the bisexuality associated with Dionysos, at least after the fourth century
BCE.82
*pÅ sgnn “the unguent,” Coptic soce±n (S) sojen (B) sacn±e (A) yavgda–n (5) “unguent.” This etymology was first set out by Paul Ernst Jablonsky in the early nineteenth century.83 It has been universally accepted ever since.
*pÅ sgr “the silence” yevgo" (5 CE) “tomb.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine can explain this word. Sgr or Sgrh “silence,” as a verb or noun, appears in the Greek si'ga, sigavw (H) “silence” Frisk and Chantraine see the etymology of this word as “obscure.”84
*pÅ sts “the prop, support” sts as a verb “raise up” bastavzw (H) “to prop, raise up, exalt, praise.” Frisk states that this word is “not securely explained.” Chantraine believes that this and the Latin bastum and basterna from which the French and English “baton” derives, both come from a third Mediterranean language.
*pÅ S=w(y)t “the shade, the soul” S=w(y)t, “shady, fresh” and S=w “air” yu–chv (H) “breath, vital force, individuality, soul” yu–vcw (H) “breathe” yu–crov" (H) yuv–cw (3) “cold, fresh.” It is a widespread paradox of language that the same words often describe both sun and shade. This is certainly true of the Egyptian S=w, which referred to sunlight. The related S=wt, however, meant “shade” and the “cold emptiness of shadows.” In this last sense, it has a Semitic cognate, the Canaanite ÷sw> “emptiness, vanity” attested in the Hebrew S=åwE>. As “air” S=w is, of course, the god S+w, referred to in Chapter 8 as the etymon for Kháos in a much earlier loan.85 Here, however, we are concerned with S=wt “shadow” as an aspect or separable part of the human personality or “soul” comparable to the bÅ or the ba.86



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 225
The Egyptian S=wt with pÅ may well be the origin of the Greek psy\khe\ and related forms. The semantic fit between the two clusters of cold, shadow and soul is excellent. On the other hand, there are serious phonetic difficulties. In the first place, S=wt as a feminine noun would take the feminine article tÅ not pÅ. As mentioned above, however, Late Egyptian had a general tendency for feminine singular, dual and plural words to be treated as masculine singular.87 In particular, the Middle Egyptian “neuter” abstracts, like dwt “evil” had been grammatically feminine and became masculine. Possibly S=w(y)t could have been treated in the same way in common speech, although S=wt as a “shade” of Ra is attested with the article tÅ. A rendition of /S+w/ as *skhw in Greek is not improbable; even though no examples of the Egyptian /S=/ as skh exist, there are examples from the Hebrew /S=/.88 The second phonetic problem is that the hypothetical loan requires the metathesis from *pskhw to *pswkh. Such a metathesis would involve splitting the phoneme and is certainly not one that I should normally accept. Even worse problems, however, spring up on the Indo-European side. Some scholars accept the group psy\khe\“breath, vital force, individuality, soul,” psy\khe\“breathe,” psy\khrós (H), psy\kho\“cool, refreshing” as a cluster. Onians even quotes the proverb “save your breath to cool your porridge.” On this he is supported by Frisk.89 Chantraine, however, follows Emile Beneveniste in insisting that breath is not cold and wind is not necessarily so.90 On the other hand, given the climate of north Africa and southeast Europe the idea of wind and shade being perceived as refreshing seems plausible. Frisk writes, “the further history of yu–vcw lies in prehistoric darkness.” Nevertheless, he goes on to “establish relations” with an Indo-European root *bhes “to blow.” How one reaches psy\kh- from *bhes is not clear. Pokorny follows Schwyzer in seeing it as onomatapoieic.91 Chantraine simply states that the etymology of the whole cluster is “unknown.” Neither the Egyptian nor the Indo-European etymologies for psy\khe\ are strong. The probability of the Egyptian, however, is increased by the context of plausible derivations for phre\n and prapís, given above, and that for ke\r, discussed in Chapter 10.
*pÅ qnbt “the court, of magistrates, tribunal, judicial council etc.” Pnuvx, Puknov" (5) “the meeting place for the citizen juries of Athens.”92 The
semantic fit is excellent and may be reinforced by the use of the u (O38)



226 BLACK ATHENA
“corner” as the determinative of qnbt. Gardiner suggested that it may be that the magistrates sat at a corner.93 The Pnyx had an amphitheatrical shape against a high cliff. As to the gender of qnbt, the preceding discussion of *pÅ smyt/psámathos showed a tendency for feminine nouns to be treated as masculine in Late Egyptian. Phonetically, the altertation p- pu- corresponds well with other Greek renderings of pÅ. Furthermore, the Late Egyptian fricative -b, was unstable. Thus, the only substantial phonetic and semantic difficulty remains the final -t. The lexicographers, failing to find an Indo-European etymology, propose a pre-Hellenic one possibly meaning “cliff.”
*pÅ gnbt “people in Punt.” This form provides an etymon for Puvgmai'oi.94
*pÅ gh≥s “the gazelle” gsˆ “run,” gs “fast,” gst “speed,” Phvgaso" (H). Gazelles, of course, are proverbial for speed. Frisk examines various hypotheses for an etymology, from Hesiod’s link to phgov" “springs” to phgov" “strong, powerful” and pe\gós “white, black.” He concludes that the word is “pre-Greek.” Chantraine believes that pe\gaí and pe\gós are folk etymologies.95
PÅ tÅ “the land,” the place-name Fqiva on the Thessalian plain, land that Homer described as eribolax “deep soiled, fertile.”96 Phthia appears to come from this attested Egyptian place name. TÅ in Egyptian means earth as opposed to sky, land as opposed to water and plain as opposed to hilly country. PÅ TÅ-n “the land of ” was transcribed into Greek as
Fqen-.97 PÅ TÅ would seem to be the etymon not merely for Phthia but also for the cluster of words pevdon (H) and pevdion (H) “fertile plain, shore.” These are usually associated with pous/podos and the IndoEuropean, and possibly the Nostratic, root for “foot.”98 The two roots undoubtedly affected each other, yet the semantic core of the cluster is much closer to pÅ tÅ “the land, plain,” which is attested as pto in Coptic.
pÅ twÅ Coptic petua “the support, lintel, to hold up, sustain” pevteuron (2) “perch, plank.” Chantraine has no explanation for the origin of this word.
*pÅ tm “completion, termination, annihilation” povtmo" (H) “unhappy fate, death.” Conventionally, potmos is linked to the verb pivptw “fall.”



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 227
Not only is the sense distant but it is also the only vocalization of the root as *pot.
*pÅ th°“the beer jug” r (W 22) pivqo", qeto “large wine jar.” Chantraine
dismisses an earlier etymology from an Indo-European root *bhidh because of the Linear B form. He now sees a labiovelar but for this to produce a labial he requires a “floating” from /e/ to /i/ and use of an Aeolic dialect. Chadwick, however, writes “neither the size of the vessel nor the form of the word, favours the identification, and it [qeto] may be one of the numerous loan words used for vessel names in Greek.”99 Given the uncertainty of the root *bhidh, píthos itself could well fit this pattern.
*pÅ tÅw Coptic the\u (B) (p)teu (S) “wind, breath” poqevw (H) noun povqo" “long for, regret.” In Egyptian poetry tÅw, the cooling north wind, is a powerful symbol of sweetness. Equally, however, in Egypt, Greece and many other cultures love and desire are likened to a fierce storm.100 As the poet in the Palatine Anthology put it, “desire [povqo"], blowing heavily, maketh great storm.”101 In Arabic hawan, hawa\ya\“love, affection” comes from the same root as hawa\“air, atmosphere, wind.”102 Since the Middle Kingdom, tÅw could also be the “wind” of creation, and, at least by late times, it served the same function as S+w in separating earth from heaven.103 A similar idea was also current among Canaanite speakers. In Gen
esis, the rûah eloh–îm, translated as pneûma theoû in the Septuagint, was the divine creative wind.104 Philo of Byblos wrote in the first century CE but he claimed to have based his works both on Sanchuniathon, a priest who had allegedly lived before the Trojan War, and on the writings of Taautos (Thoth). The existence of “writings of Thoth,” at least in the Egyptian Late Period (1000–300 BCE), has now been confirmed.105 The discovery of parallels in Ugaritic myths has dispelled much of the skepticism around Philo’s claims of high antiquity.106 Some of the cosmogony was distinctively Canaanite but Egyptian influence was strong on the Phoenician coast. Thus, it is inherently possible that Philo’s Pothós, “sacred wind or breath, desire” in Greek, was originally an Egyptian term. It played a central role not only in Philo’s Byblian cosmogony but also in a Sidonian one.107 Apart from Byblos’ millennia of close association with Egypt, such a view is strengthened by Philo’s reference to the “writings of Thoth.” The hypothesis that Pothós derived from *pÅ tÅw is also reinforced by a possible Egyptian etymology for Philo-Sanchuniaton’s proper name or technical term, Mo–t. Mo–t was the product of Póthos the “wind’s falling

in love with its own beginnings.” Martin West plausibly envisions this as a whirlwind. Philo described it: “Some say the ooze from a watery mixture. And from this came the whole seed of creation, the genesis of all things.”108 West denies that there is a “plausible Semitic etymology for Mo–t.”109 L. R. Clapham in his thesis on Sanchuniaton, however, argued that Mo–t came from an earlier form of the Hebrew mwt, which generally meant “shake” or “quake.” Some scholars, however, maintain it had the specific meaning of “quagmire.”110 An Egyptian word should also be taken into account. Commonly transcribed mtwt, it means “semen, seed, progeny” and, by the Ptolemaic period, the ‘“fertilizing Nile flood.”111 The semantic fit with Philo’s Mo–t is perfect; the problem lies with the form mtwt. Commonly writing of hieroglyphs had graphic transpositions, particularly with signs represent
ing birds.112 In the various spellings of *mtwt the quail chick w (w) was,
in all but one case, placed elegantly in the middle.113 The possibility that it was pronounced *mwtt is increased by Afroasiatic cognates. Takács lists Highland East Cushitic and North Omotic forms as muta “penis.”114 At a greater semantic remove, Orel and Stolbova construct a root *mut “man,” found in Semitic and Chadic.115 In short, Philo’s Mo–t may well have been influenced by an Egyptian *mwtt, supporting in turn an Egyptian derivation of Pothós Can Philo’s Phoenician Pothós be connected to the Greek póthos? Philo’s Pothós combined wind and desire, just as the Egyptian tÅw did. The orthodox etymology for pothé o\—maintained by Pokorny, Frisk and
Chantraine—is from a root *guhedh- (*k¢wedh-), resulting in the Old Irish gui(i)diu “pray.”116 There are clearly problems of meaning here. Chantraine is less sure on phonetic grounds; the semantically more attractive possible cognates with a root *ged- “long for, miss” are in Baltic and Slav languages. Given the worldwide connection between wind and desire, however, the Egyptian etymology seems preferable.117
pÅ dw Demotic pÅ tw, Coptic ptou (S) pto–u (B) “the mountain,” a title used in many place-names. Ptwvon (6) mountain in Boiotia.118 In Coptic the meaning was extended in two directions and was also used for “desert” and “monastery.” Mt. Pto–:on had an oracular cult of Apollo Ptwvi>o" Pto–:oïos.119 Neither Frisk nor Chantraine provide entries for this. Pokorny links Pto–:on and Pto–:oïos to a root *pta–-, pto–-, and pta=- “cower, flee, fall.”



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 229
Greek borrowings from Egyptian words beginning with the feminine singular definite article
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the masculine gender and definite article gained on the feminine during the Late Egyptian period. Therefore, many fewer plausible Greek etymologies can be drawn from this source. The following are a few examples of this type.
*tÅ ˆŒrt “the Uraeus” tiav–ra (5) “high Persian royal headress.” Chantraine sees it as a loan possibly from Phrygian. Frisk writes, “Oriental foreign word of unknown origins.”
*tÅ bˆnt “the evil” Coptic boone divban (5CE) Cretan divfa" -an (2CE) “snake.” Frequently, snakes are the symbols of evil in Egyptian—and other cultures.120 Chantraine links these terms to di–favw “to investigate, explore.” On the grounds that “snakes slide into cracks”! Di–favw (H), for which neither Frisk nor Chantraine can provide an explanation, would seem more likely to come from the Egyptian dbn in the sense of “going around, encircling.”
tÅ nmtt “stride, march, movement, action” Demotic nmtt, Coptic tnomte (S), nomti (B), namte (Akhminic, A), namti (Fayumic, F) “strength, power.” Vycichl reconstructs a feminine participle *namitat> namtat becoming an abstract noun. It was translated into Greek as ijscuv" iskhús or duvnami".
Both C±erny and Vycichl are puzzled by the shift in meaning from “stride” to “power.” The best explanation would seem to me to be from a march or procession as the entourage of authority and power. An analogy would be the Elizabethan use of “power” to refer to “a body of armed men.” In Greek we find duvna±mai(H) “be capable of ” duvna±mi" “might, force of war, authority” duvnato" (H) “powerful, capable.” Pokorny follows Ernout and Meillet in associating these words with a root *deu or *dou or *du and with such cognates as the Sanskrit duvas “offer, honor,” the Old Latin duenos “good” and the Irish den “strong.” Chantraine disagrees; he and Frisk see a nasal infix indicating the present tense du-n-. He admits, however, that in this case it is difficult to explain the -n- in the noun dynvamis. He is “tempted” to see a connection with den–“long, long time,” but he cannot find a “satisfactory link” between the two clusters. Both



230 BLACK ATHENA
Frisk and Chantraine maintain that the -s- in dunavsth" dynáste\s (5) “lord,” is “nonetymological.” The Egyptian etymology for dynva ̈mai and duvnato" explains the alternation between n and t as alternative reductions of *tÅ nmtt. As mentioned above, a final -t in Egyptian is frequently rendered -is in Greek.
A Greek borrowing from an Egyptian word beginning with the common plural definite article
In this section I provide only one example; *nÅ n(y) nfr(w)t “the beautiful young women” and nuvmfai (H) “nymphs.” In Chapter 11, I shall consider the Egyptian origins of both the names and the cults of the Muses who are rightly often confused with nymphs, and who share many characteristics. Here I shall simply consider the name. Paul Kretschmer and others tried to link nymphe\to the Latin nubo “marry.”121 Frisk and Chantraine, however, are not satisfied with this and see the etymology as “obscure.” I maintain that nymphe\should be derived from the Egyptian nÅ n(y) nfr(w)t “the beautiful young women.” The Egyptian nfr, which Gardiner
reconstructed as *nu–fe(r), meant “youth” as well as “beauty.”122 In fact, the Greek root nymph-, like the Egyptian nfr, could be used for young people of either sex. In Greek, however, nymph- had a number of other meanings. For instance, numfaiva was a Greek name for water lilies and lotuses, including a species called nenuphar. This term is derived from the Arabic ninufar that, in turn, appears to come from the Egyptian nÅ n(y) nfrt. Aristotle used nymphe\as a term for “young bee or wasp in the pupa stage,” a scientific usage that persists today. In these species the form of the “pupa”or penultimate stage of metamorphosis—resembles that of the adult and could, in fact, be called an “adolescent.” This is remarkable in view of the bee or wasplike appearances of the young genii found in Minoan and Mycenaean art. The association survived iconographically into the Archaic period. An Archaic metal plaque from Rhodes has figures that are half-nymph (in the sense of sylphlike creature) and half-bee.123 These and the Latin borrowings lympha and possibly limpidus will be discussed further in Chapter 11.



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 231
THE EGYPTIAN WORD PR “HOUSE, TEMPLE, PALACE”
An extraordinary array of words in many other languages resemble the Egyptian pr in both form and meaning. Bomhard reconstructs a Nostratic root *p[h]al / *p[h]El “settlement, settled place.” He finds it in the PIE *p[h]l`H as well as in Uralic, Altaic and Dravidian. Interestingly, however, he does not include Afroasiatic or the Egyptian pr because it fails to live up to his strict phonetic standards of cognicity.124 Orel and Stolbova also fail to construct an Afroasiatic root *pVr. Alexander Militarev and other Russian scholars have proposed a number of Berber cognates; Takács is unenthusiastic about these. Their case is strengthened somewhat by the Latin word mapali–a “a type of hut,” which the Roman author Sallust described as a Numidian word.125 The prefix m- often expresses locality. Théophile Obenga, a student of Cheikh Anta Diop, has proposed a number of Central Chadic terms p-r and also some Niger-Kordofanian words, such as the Wolof per “dressed fence around the house.”126 The root *pel- “house” is also present in Bantu.127 Even more puzzling are a number of ancient southwest Asian parallels, such as two Anatolian roots *pir and *parn. Mount Parnassos is thought to be the one solid Anatolian place-name in Greece and for that reason is frequently cited by orthodox scholars.128 Similar words occur in Hurrian and Urartian. Takács states, “if there was a connection it must have been a cultural wanderwort, although it would be difficult to reconstruct the ways of borrowing.129 It would seem to me that *par(n) fits the pattern of very early borrowings between Afroasiatic and PIH discussed in Chapter 4.130
In 1927 Alan Gardiner wrote, “!!!!! might stand, not only for pa\ru,
but also for per ̈, a\pr, epr, epra, and so forth. . . . pronounced pår (from påru) in isolation, [it] may well have represented *per ̈ when followed by a genitive and *pra ̈(yyu) in the plural.”131 In 1963 Donald Redford envisioned two different reconstructions: pa\re ̈y from the Coptic -po\r and per ̈e ̈y from the Coptic -pe.132 In more recent work, Antonio Loprieno reconstructs pr as par ̈uw. 133
Greek borrowings from pr
pr “house, household estate, palace” ba'ri" bâris (2) “domain, fortified great house.” Frisk and Chantraine suggest that this could derive from Illyrian and link it to bauriva a word for “house” in the Messapian



232 BLACK ATHENA
language of Apulia, which was linked to the Illyrian languages on the other side of the Adriatic.134 If such is the case, it would belong to the family of words described above. The semantics seem closer to that of the Egyptian pr. The difficulty with the Egyptian etymology, however, is that the -a–- indicates a borrowing before the shift a:ˇ>o:ˇaround 1200 BCE. Chantraine plausibly maintains that this bâris is unrelated to another meaning “flat boat,” the Egyptian etymology of which from the Demotic br is unchallenged.
pr or pr ŒÅ “great house, palace” Puvlo" puro, name of the palace at “Pylos.” “House, palace” would be a very suitable name for two placenames mentioned in the Linear B texts. The phonetics are more problematic because the texts date to the thirteenth century and, according to the experts, before 1200 BCE the vocalization would have been *pa–rrather than the later *po–r—which would provide the better correspondence for puro. Nevertheless, I do not think it worth abandoning this Egyptian etymology that has no Indo-European competitor. It is also worth noting that the name Nevstor Nestor, ruler of the Messenian Pylos has a plausible Egyptian etymology in either Nst H≥r “royal throne” or Nst wr “great throne,” both of which titles are attested.135 That the word referred to a title rather than an individual would explain Nestor’s longevity, which so amazed Homer.
pr, puvlh (H) “city or palace gate, gatehouse.” Perhaps there is confusion here with the verb prˆ Coptic qualitative pori (S) phori (B) and the nouns prw Coptic paure and prt “going out.” Frisk contrasts puvlo" with the Indo-European quvra “door” and says that it has no etymology. Chantraine agrees.
pr, fuvlax (H) “guard, sentinel.” The semantic parallels are obvious. As Chantraine points out the final -ak, simply marks an agent. He specifically denies that this word can be related to puvlh. Nevertheless, not only does alternation in general suggest a loan, but the difference between the Lower Egyptian Boharic aspirated stops and the Upper Egyptian Sahidic plain ones could explain this particular case.136
pr, fu'lon (H) fu'lh (5) “tribe, constituted by relationship or habitation.” Masson cites Chantraine as deriving this word from two branches of the Indo-European root *bheu- /*bheuE÷ “grow, swell, live.” He links it



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 233
to the -bhu in *tribhu “tribe.” Pr “house, palace” can also mean the inhabitants of these buildings, as a family or administration. In many ancient cultures, “house” can mean “dynasty or people”: byt in Semitic or oikos in Greek and domus in Latin. Regarding the Egyptian etymology,
it is also interesting to note that in Ptolemaic times ful`hvwas used as a term for a subdivision of priests at each Egyptian temple.137
Greek borrowings from Egyptian words with pr- prefix
Naturally reduced forms of pr were used as prefixes. In late times, pr- as the prefix to a place-name was frequently treated in the same way as pÅ. Redford found examples in Coptic, Akkadian, Hebrew and Greek transliterations of P-, Pi-, Po and Pa as well as B-, Bo- and Bou-. Alongside these, however, he found some in which the r is still present: Phr, Per-,
Pher- and Bar-. In addition to these are the transliterations of pr ŒÅ “the
great house, ParŒoah” in Hebrew, farawvin Greek and prro and puro in Coptic. Redford explains those with -r, either as being old, before the loss of the -r, or as the result of a conscious archaism powerful during the Twenty-sixth or Saite Dynasty, 664–525 BCE. This may be a case of misplaced precision, but it is clear that there were alternations between PV- and Pr/V.138
Greek borrowings from Egyptian forms and names beginning with pr
Pr Åb sanctuary of the reliquary, Åb b (R17) Priva–po" (5) Pr Åb was a
phallic fetish of Osiris that also served as the symbol for the nome of Abydos and was an alternative name for that city.139 Abydos was the cult center of Osiris, among whose ceremonies were some in which phalloi played an important part. Herodotos described the festivals of Dionysus whom he repeatedly identified with Osiris:
. . . the Egyptian method of celebrating the festival of Dionysus is very much the same as the Greek, except that the Egyptians have no choric dance. Instead of the phallus they have puppets, about eighteen inches high: the genitals of these figures are made almost as big as the rest of their bodies, and they are pulled up and down by strings as the women carry them around the villages.140



234 BLACK ATHENA
Priva–po" “phallic god, or phal(l)os” was traditionally supposed to derive from the phallic rites of the city of Priva–po" on the northwest coast of Anatolia. Frisk is inclined to accept this derivation but Chantraine is more skeptical. Neither proposes an Indo-European etymology. The idea of Egyptian influences on toponyms in northwestern Anatolia is made less absurd by the place-name Abydos on the Dardenelles, sixty miles to the west of Pría–pos. The coincidence of the paired names of the Egyptian city is made still more remarkable by the presence of satyrs and the satrai linked to the cult of Dionysos. These are connected with phallic or priapic cults in Thrace on the European side of the straits. They will be discussed in Chapter 10.141
pr ŒÅ “big house, palace, pharaoh,” Faravw/Farovw and Favro" Pháros (H), island off the western Delta, later the site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria.
Pr Œnh°. Nineteenth-century German scholars maintained that the Bragcidai oracular priests at the temple of Apollo at Didyma near Miletus, were related to the Sanskrit Brahman. In view of this cult’s mythological and archaeological contacts with Egypt, it would seem more plausible to derive it from the toponym Pr Œn∆.142
pr Œnh.°This controversial term will be more fully discussed in Chapter 10. One sense is undoubtedly “temple scriptorium,” pivnax-ko" (H) “writing tablet, flat.” Frisk and Chantraine derive it from a root found also in the Old Church Slavonic pini “tree stump” and the Sanskrit pinaka “baton, cane.” Both are concerned by the semantic shift but see an analogy in the Latin caudex “tree trunk, wooden table, book.” Both etymologies or a combination of the two are possible.
Pr WÅdyt temple-city of WÅdyt, Coptic Puto (B)/Puto–u/Buto (B) Greek Boutw,v Bou'to" city in the northwestern Delta, Afrodi–vth Aphrodite (H). Hesiod set out the traditional etymology for the name Aphrodite in his Theogony. He writes that, after Krónos had harvested the genitals of his father Uranos and thrown them into the sea, they had, after a long time, formed leuko;" ajfro;" “white foam” (semen?) from which the body of Aphrodite was created.143 This image has haunted the European imagination ever since, most notably in Botticelli’s famous painting The Birth of Venus. According to Hesiod, Aphrodite emerged either near the island



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 235
of Cythera (Kythe–ra) between the Peloponnese and Crete or several hundred miles to the east, near the shore of Cyprus.144 Her most frequent bynames were Kytherian and Paphian from her cult centers on Kythera and at Paphos on the western coast of Cyprus. Modern lexicographers do not accept the derivation from aphrós. Some have sought an Indo-European etymology, but Frisk and Chantraine deny this both on the grounds of specific phonetic and semantic difficulties and because of their conviction that Aphrodite came from the “Orient.” Equally, however, they are not persuaded by the attempt to derive it from the name of Aphrodite’s Semitic counterpart, Astarte, because of the phonetic absurdity. They are resigned to declaring the etymology “unknown,” or “unexplained.” Frisk and Chantraine, however, do not consider an Egyptian etymology, which is, in fact, far stronger. The phonetic correspondence between Pr WÅdyt and Afrodi–vth is good. It explains the final -dite, which the
traditional etymology cannot do. While Gardiner doubts that the E (M13)
in WÅdyt was pronounced wÅ, he is obliged to admit that it is spelled in this way in a Pyramid Text.145 There is little difficulty in proposing a prothetic >aleph before the double consonant, *ˆPr WÅdyt. Indeed, Gardiner mentioned the possible reading of pr as *apr in the passage quoted near the beginning of this section. The name Aphrodite was clearly introduced after the /Å/ had lost its consonantal value. A problem with the -r- arises from Hesiod and Homer, who make it too early for the sixth-century revival of the pronunciation as /r/ envisaged by Redford. Equally, their information must have been before the final -yt was dropped.146 At the other end, no reference to Aphrodite has been found in Linear B texts, so far. We know, however, that WÅdyt was worshipped in the Aegean in the Second Millennium. Furthermore, as stated above, we cannot be sure that during the Saite Dynasty was the only time in which the /r/ written in pr was revived. Semantically the case for deriving Aphrodíte from Pr WÅdyt is very strong indeed. WÅdyt was a goddess of fertility, associated with the new growth after the flood, just as Aphrodite was with spring and youthful
love. The name of WÅdyt was written with a lotus and a snake, e (m14),
as snakes emerged in that season. In Egypt divinities were often identified with their dwellings, temples or cities. Other examples of this will be given below. In this case, it is known that Pr WÅdyt was sometimes used as the name of the goddess herself. It was recorded in a list as a form of



236 BLACK ATHENA
Hathor and Aphrodite was the Greek counterpart of Hathor. The tenth nome of Upper Egypt was dedicated to WÅdyt and Gardiner identified the leading town on the west bank of that nome, WÅdyt or Pr WÅdyt, with the Greek toponym Afrodi–vth" povli".147 Objects found at Knossos suggest that WÅdyt was worshipped in the Aegean in the Second Millennium. First was a class of figurines of beautiful women holding or enveloped by snakes.148 The best known of these is the glazed faience figurine of a bare-breasted, wasp-waisted woman in a flounced skirt, holding a snake in her one remaining hand. For reasons of symmetry there must originally have been two.149 Not only are beauty and snakes represented but associated model votive robes are decorated with, as Evans puts it, “sacred saffron flowers in which the influence of Egyptian lotus clumps is clearly traceable.”150 Although the style is distinctively Minoan, the multiple symbolism of sensuous beauty and snakes and lotus, associated her in the mind of the excavator, with “Wazet” WÅdyt and Hathor.151 In this context it is interesting, but not necessarily indicative, that an incomplete Egyptian statuette found at Knossos is of a personage with the name Wsr Wdyt.152 The figure seems to date to the Sixth Dynasty at the end of the Old Kingdom or the Middle Kingdom. The date of the context in which it was found is hotly contested. Evans put it at Middle Minoan II (MMII, from the end of the nineteenth century BCE), making it contemporaneous to the end of the Middle Kingdom. Revisionist scholars, however, now put the context of discovery at the MMIII at the earliest, that is anything up to eight hundred years after it was made.153 There is no necessity for Wsr Wdyt ever to have been in Crete. His statuette could have been imported at any time in the interim. On the other hand, the inscription is engraved with unusual clumsiness, which suggests that it was made in Crete, by someone who knew, or knew of, Wsr Wdyt. Thus, the likelihood is that it was kept on Crete for some time, perhaps centuries, before its final deposition. This increases the chances that the figurine was treasured because it was part of the cult of Wdyt, which existed in Crete through the figurines. Archaeology has revealed that the cult, if not the name of Aphrodite, was known in Late Bronze Age Palaio-Paphos, the cult center of Aphrodite and her Phoenician counterpart Astarte, on Cyprus.154 Interestingly, however, Pausanias maintained that, before the Greek foundation of the Paphian cult on the extreme west of the island, there was already one at the center of the island at Golgoi.155 The name Golgoi



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 237
has a clear Egyptian etymology in the common Egyptian toponym, Grg “foundation, colony.” No doubt an important cult of the goddess was established there.156 Aphrodite was known as either Paphia or Golgia throughout Cyprus. At the then-Phoenician city of Idalion, near Golgoi, coins were struck in the early fifth century. They showed a seated sphinx and a lotus flower, “perhaps symbols of Aphrodite,” as the modern scholar Carl O. Bennet has noted.157 Symbols of Hathor associated with Aphrodite from the classical period have been found throughout the island.158 To conclude, it would seem either that the absence of the name Aphrodite from the Linear B texts is accidental or that the Cretan Wdyt was known by another name, possibly Wanassa “queen,” by which she was known in the conservative Cypriot syllabary.159 Nevertheless, the firm establishment of the goddess in Hesiod’s Theogony and the Homeric epics indicate strongly that she was already known as Aphrodite by the end of the Second Millennium.
*Pr WÅdyt as beu'do" (6). The root wÅd on its own meant “ fresh, green” and one specialized word wÅdt was “green linen.”160 Pr WÅdyt was not only the name of the city of Buto– but, as shown above, it was also the name of the goddess herself. Thus the combination of green linen, the rich city of Buto–and the goddess of beauty make Pr WÅdyt a convincing etymon for beûdos “rich female garment.” Frisk states that it is an unexplained foreign word. Chantraine agrees but writes that it has perhaps an Asiatic origin. The Egyptian one seem preferable.
Pr BÅstt Coptic Pubasti/ Bubasti, Greek Bouvbasti" “City of the Goddess BÅstt,” name of the goddess herself. Bouvbasti" boúbastis (6CE) also means “groin, pubis.” Chantraine links this to Boubwvn “groin, pubis.”
He and Frisk derive boubo\nvfrom an Indo-European root also found in the Sanskrit, gavin–i–“groin, lower stomach.” Chantraine, however, admits that the structure is “a little different.” Another possible source for
boubo\nvis from the Egyptian, bÅbÅw Coptic be\b <*bu–(r)bu–(r) “hole, cranny.” Takács cannot decide among the many plausible Afroasiatic etymologies for this word.161 While there is little doubt that boúbastis as “pubis”
may have been influenced by boubo\nv, it is equally likely to have been derived from the city name and, in particular, from the festival of BÅstt, which Herodotos describes as the best attended in Egypt: “they come in barges men and women together, a great number in each boat. . . .



238 BLACK ATHENA
whenever they pass a town on the riverbank, they bring the barge close in-shore some of the women continuing to act as I have said, while others shout abuse at the women of the place, or start dancing or stand up and hitch up their skirts.”162 The Greek ajnasuvrontai ajnistavmenai has a stronger implication of exposure. The Hebrew form of the name was Pî beset, which has resonances with bo\S=et “shame,” particularly of nakedness and exposure of the pudenda.163 The lexicographers Ernout and Meillet have “no sure etymology” for the Latin pu\be\s “the hair that characterizes puberty.” They attempt to link it to the Sanskrit pumán “man” but are unhappy with the connection. They absolutely deny any association with Latin puer “boy.” Probably because of its late attestation, they do not consider the Greek bouvbasti". Chantraine suggests, however, that Bubastis may be “ancient” and, unlike pu\be\s, it has a plausible etymology. Thus, it is probable the terms “pubis” and “puberty” etc. come from the orgiastic celebrations at Pr BÅstt in the Nile Delta.
Pr n h°pr “house of the Scarab or of the god Ôprr” Demotic city name: Parnovpion, biname of Apollo on the Athenian Acropolis. This word is commonly derived from pavrnoy, povrnoy, or kovrnoy “grasshopper or locust.” The god being portrayed as a protector from locusts.164 There may be some confusion here, but “locust” is more likely to be a folk etymology. The derivation of the name Apollo from the Egyptian H°prr, god of the morning sun, will be discussed in Chapter 19, below.
Pr Rwty “house of the double lion” The idea of the Rwty as creator gods S+w and Tfnt goes back to the Pyramid Texts of the Late Old Kingdom or beyond.165 Later in the Book of Coming Out By Day, the Double Lion “is in his cavern [Pr Rwty], warden of the House of the Royal Wig Cover.”166 The Double Lion is clearly associated with the underworld. Plou'to" Pluto (H) “treasures of earth” and personified by Hesiod as a son of Demeter.167 Frisk and Chantraine link it to plé(w)o\“float [hence?] spread, flood.” While possible phonetically, from the semantic point of view this is a very strange etymology. A related personification, Plouvtwn, was seen as the beneficent underworld as opposed to the punishing: ”Aidh". Hades received its/his name from h≥dˆ as an intransitive verb “to be destroyed” and as a noun “damage, destruction.” The Coptic form was hoj–“oppress, torture.” The name may also have been influenced by
the Syrian thunder god H≥adad. Frisk sets out a number of hypotheses to



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 239
explain Haide\s. Neither he nor Chantraine finds any of these worthwhile. Another subterranean deity was Daveira. The name appears to come from dwÅt “netherworld.” Chantraine tentatively derives it from the Vedic dasrà “miracle maker.”
Pr Tm Coptic Pitho\m (S) Petho\m (B) the Wadi Tûmilat, the fertile valley linking the eastern Delta and the pools now known as the Bitter Lakes around Ismailia on the present Suez Canal. Intermittently under powerful pharaohs, at least as early as the Middle Kingdom, the wadi was excavated to form a canal linking the Nile—through the lakes—to the Red Sea. The key city on the canal was Pr ˆTm (temple of Atum) which is generally accepted as the city known in Exodus as Pîto–m, Pe(i)qw or Piqwm in the Septuagint.168 Herodotos named it Patou'mo" Ajrabia".169 It was later known simply as Patoumos. In Latin it was known as Patoumus or Pithona Civitas.170 Potamov" (H) “water course, river [later?] canal.” The conventional etymology is to link it to the pivptw, e[peton “fall.”171 Chantraine is not completely satisfied with this derivation and still less with one from petavnnumi “spread,” suggested by earlier scholars.” (See the bibliography in Frisk.) The phonetic difficulty with a derivation of potamos from Pr Tm is merely the vocalic metathesis a-o>o-a, Patoumos>potamos. This is not serious in itself and could also be explained by loans before and after the Canaanite shift. Two semantic problems arise with a derivation potamos from Pr Tm. First, nothing attests that the canal was named after the city, although many examples of this practice exist around the world: Lake Geneva, Yángzi Jia–ng (Yangtse) after the region and city Yangzhou, are only two of them. Furthermore, the modern name Wadi Tûmilat provides an indication that the wadi or canal itself was known as Pr iTm. The second problem, which is more serious, is the lack of an analogy to the pattern of a general geographical term deriving from a specific one, although mountains are sometimes referred to as “Everests” or waterfalls as “Niagaras.” Despite these difficulties the etymology remains plausible, especially in the absence of a serious Indo-European competitor.
Pr thn “house of brilliance,” temple in Sais; Parqevnwn “temple of

R- “ENTRY” OR LOCAL PREFIX
The vocalization of the Egyptian localizing prefix r(a)- as la- is noted here in the cases of Larissa and laura. Unstressed, the prefix became lelE- or l- in Coptic. Hence, the Greek borrowings became le- or li-.172
r-Åh≥t “entry to the fertile land,” Avaris, Larivs(s)a, Laríssa “placename for cities dominating rich lands.”173 Another possible derivation from r-Åh≥t is jRarion, the fertile plain near Eleusis that is sacred to Demeter.174
r-ˆb “stomach” laparov" (H) “softness, soft flanks of the stomach.” Frisk and Chantraine see structural parallels and links to other adjectives but provide no etymology for laparov" itself.

r-wÅt “way, lane” Coptic raoe\(B) raue\(S) “neighborhood” lauvra (H) “narrow passage, lane, tunnel.” Frisk states that this word is usually associated with la'a" “stone,” but there are doubts. Chantraine denies this etymology altogether. The loan from Egyptian must be early because of the value of the /Å/.
r-pdtyw “foreigners (people of the bow, pdt; Coptic pite)” pdt, pdtyw “troop,” transcribed in Babylonian as pitatiú.176 Late Egyptian R- pdt “conflict?” Lapivqai (H) Lapiths, “Enemies and stout warriors,” according to Homer.177
*r-mny “place of mooring” limhvn (6) “harbor, port.” Chantraine asso
ciates lime\nvwith livmnh (H) “lake pond” and leimwvn (H) “water meadow.” He is uncertain about the etymology of the group but considers connecting it to the Vedic nimná “wet hole” or the Latin limus “mud” and the Teutonic slim “slime.” If we accept the association, the Egyptian etymology is preferable. Vycichl pointed out that the two apparently incongruous meanings of mny “to pasture livestock, to moor a ship” are linked because in Egypt, as in many other places, both involved tying to a (fixed mn) post (mnˆt).178

In Late Egyptian a term rmnyt “domain, domain lands” is written

*r-qn(ij) “mat, basket” livknon (4) “winnowing basket,” sacred basket for offerings of first fruits to Demeter and Dionysos. Chantraine relates this word to likmavw “to winnow” and links it to Gaulish, níthio and Breton niza “winnow.” This would seem to derive from the Egyptian *ˆrˆ qmÅ “make, winnow.”

(R)dijt, “CAUSAL PREFIX”
The Egyptian verb rdˆ “to give,” may, as Takács writes, be the result of “contamination” of various Afroasiatic roots found in Semitic and East Cushitic.181 I have been able to discover only one Greek derivation from the Egyptian verb in this full form. The name Rhadamanthys is from an unattested, but completely regular, Egyptian name *Rdˆ Mntw, “Mntw gives,” “whom Mntw has given.” The intricate relations of Rhadamanthys and his brother Minos with Egyptian and Cretan bull cults are set out in Volume 2.182 As do many Nostratic language families, Afroasiatic has an /s/ causative, usually prefixed.183 Egyptian also has this form. Very early, however, the prefix ceased to be “productive,” that is to say, added to new verbs. It was replaced in this function by rdˆ added to the prospective form of the verb. This prefix became extremely common in Middle Egyptian.184 At a very early stage, the initial r- was dropped, giving d ˆ or dˆt. Vycichl set out a detailed chart showing the renditions of d ˆ in the various Coptic dialects. In all the normal form was ti. The prepronominal forms in Sahidic and Bohairic, however, were taa and t ei\, respectively, and the qualitative forms were to and toi in those major dialects.185 Many verbs of this kind were copied into Greek.

*dˆt Åq Demotic dit Åq, Coptic tako “to destroy, perish, lose,” thvkw (H)
Doric ta–vkw “melt, dissolve, be lost, waste away, be consumed.” Frisk and Chantraine derive it from an Indo-European root, *teE2 /tE2 “soak” (which is not the chief meaning of te–ko–). They see the -k and its analogies to the form in some Greek aorists but admit that it has not been found outside Greek.
dˆt ˆr(y) tro (S) thro (B) “cause to do” dra–vw (H) “to do, accomplish,” particularly in the sense of “service rendered by a servant, responsibility.” Frisk and Chantraine see a connection with the Lithuanian darau\ darytvî and the Latvian darît “to do,” although Chantraine is somewhat skeptical. Frisk argues the verbs “to do, make” are late abstractions so that there are often many varieties, as in Greek pravttw, poievw, and e[rdw. I believe that he is mistaken and that in this case, as in many others, the Greek vocabulary, like the English, is enriched by drawing upon many sources: érdo\, native Indo-European; dra\:o Egyptian; and poieo\, from Semitic. Poieo–will be discussed in Chapter 14, and the complications of pratto–in Chapter 17.186
dˆt ŒÅ “make great honor” Demotic ty ŒÅ, Coptic taio\, ti–vw “honor, esteem.” Chantraine is concerned with the radical ti-. He points out that Benveniste and others postulated an Indo-European root *kwi or *kwei and saw a parallel in the Sanskrit ca\:yati “respect.”187 Other scholars, including Frisk, see a connection with tíno\ “pay debt, or fine etc.” (See below). Chantraine writes that if one accepts this interpretation, the element ti- loses all meaning.
dˆt ˆnw “cause to bring (ˆnw /tribute)” Demotic ty ˆnw, Coptic tnnou “send, send for, search for” ti–nw (H) usually tivnw “pay debt or fine, pay back.” Frisk and Chantraine see tíno\as cognate to the Sanskrit present cinute from a labiovelar “observe, notice.” In this sense, as Chantraine put it, it could have “given birth in Greek to its use as ‘chastise, punish?’” They see the -n- in tíno\as a present infix and the bases as *teis- or *teit-. These would indeed be cognate to the Sanskrit cayati “revenge punish.” I see no reason to deny that the -n- is an element of the root. The least unlikely explanation is that there has been a conflation of a native Indo-European form from *kwi /*kwei-s/t to the Egyptian dˆt ˆnw in the older sense of “to



[CH. 9] GREEK BORROWINGS FROM EGYPTIAN 243
cause to bring tribute.” I see the further complications having been caused by influence from another Egyptian verb *dˆt dˆ Demotic ty tw “make give,” Coptic tto.
*dˆt mÅŒ Demotic tymÅŒ Coptic tmaio\“render true, justify, be justified,
praise” The Greek timhv, tême–vDoric ti–ma– and timavw, tê\maov\ (H) “honor”188 (mÅŒt itself will be discussed in the next chapter). Jasanoff and Nussbaum object to this etymology on both semantic and formal grounds. Semantically, they claim that the meanings “truth” and “justification” have nothing to do with the Greek tême.\: According to them, “its meanings are ‘honor(s) accorded to gods and kings . . . reward, compensation’”189 Against this argument is the fact that the Coptic tmaio\was used to translate the Greek makariousi “blessed” (honors from God), timân “to honor” and timian poein “to make honor.” Jasanoff and Nussbaum also fail to consider the central and wideranging importance of the concept of mÅŒt in Egyptian culture. This word means not merely “truth” and “justice” but also the order of the universe. Offering or giving mÅŒt, dˆ(t) mÅŒt was a royal ritual with many functions. One was to establish and reaffirm the legitimacy of the pharaoh’s rule.190 Tême\:has a meaning, found in Hesiod, of “a present or offering to the Gods.”191 Greek words related to Tême\:also overlap with dˆ(t) mÅŒ. Têmesivs has a meaning of “estimation, assessment” and tímo\ro\ “avenge, punish,” which fits well with the basic sense of dˆ(t) mÅŒ “cause
to become just.” The sense of “praise” fits well with tême\:as “honors.” All in all, even though both the Egyptian and Greek words are wide ranging, the semantic fits are remarkably good. I quite agree with Jasanoff, and Nussbaum that têmeo\and têo\“I honor” are fundamentally related, but we differ regarding connections. They
see both words as deriving from the hypothetical *kw linked to a Sanskrit root ci/ca\y “note, observe, respect,” mentioned above (although as Chantraine pointed out, the proposed relationship is rather more complicated and dubious). On the other hand, I see common derivation from the Middle Egyptian causative dˆt or more precisely the Late Egyptian form recorded in the Demotic ty. The long /i–/ in ti\me\and ti\o\and tíno\ indicates that these words were taken into Greek before pretonic vowels were reduced to /E/ in Coptic at the end of the Second Millennium BCE. This fits with evidence from the Greek side: the absence—so farof these words from the Linear B tablets and their firm establishment in epic poetry. The Egyptian etymologies explain the links and differences



244 BLACK ATHENA
among ti|me,\: ti\o\and tíno\and they are certainly semantically and phonetically superior, as well as more direct, to the uncertain and tangled hypothetical gossamer linking them to Sanskrit and PIE.
*dˆt nqr “cause to sift” tinavssw (H) (tinavxai, tinavgmo") “to shake, winnow.” Both Frisk and Chantraine refer to August Fick’s “ingenious” derivation of tinavxai from a hypothetical *kinavxai coming from kinevw (7) “move” (transitive and intransitive), “trouble, overturn.”192 The phonetic shift is extraordinary and the semantic relationship is not that close. Kinéo\itself requires some hypothetical maneuvering to explain in terms of the Indo-European root *kEi-: *k•*- and -n- infix, although it is present in all tenses. Chantraine has difficulty in explaining the long /i–/. It would seem simpler to derive it from the Canaanite qinåh “ardor, zeal, jealousy,” which is deeply rooted in Semitic.
CONCLUSION
While the prefixing of (R)dit- and r- has previously been obscure for non-Egyptologists, the firm adhesion of definite articles and the common prefix Pr- to the nouns and verbs they modify has been known to students of Coptic since the field was founded in Europe in the seventeenth century. With very few exceptions in place-names and such ideologically acceptable terms such as pavn “Nile fish” or *pÅ sgnn yavgda–n “the unguent,” these prefixes have not been considered possible etyma by lexicographers of Greek. This extraordinary lacuna can only be explained in terms of the politics of scholarship.193

his chapter and Chapter 11 treat the ramifications in Greek of a number of terms central to Egyptian civilization. As such, they are precisely those that one should expect to have been exported. It is, therefore, not surprising to find that they do in fact provide many plausible origins for Greek words with no, or only very improbable, IndoEuropean etymologies.
1. NTR/KÅ
The hieroglyphic for ntr ≈ (R8) was a cloth wound round a pole, an
emblem of divinity used broadly for gods, including deceased monarchs,
and for the life force in general. Even more difficult to define is kÅ Ì
(D28) “embracing arms”: it is a spirit or one of the Egyptian souls, a manifestation, agent or doppelganger of a person or divinity. Interestingly, ntr and kÅ may well have a common origin. The origin of the Egyptian /t/from an earlier/ky/ and /Å/ as a liquid /r/ or/l/ were discussed in Chapter 8 above.1 Thus one could hypothesize a form *enkera in which
originally allophonic variants of /k/ and /ky/ became phonemically distinct and the palatalized variant lost its initial /n/. In fact, the hypothetical proto-form exists in reality as inke\ra and enkera\“soul, life” in the Central Cushitic languages of Bilen and Kwara. Franz Calice pointed this out in his posthumous work published in 1936. Werner Vycichl

dismissed their significance because “these languages resemble Egyptian so little.”2 I do not believe the parallel can be dismissed so easily as it is clear that Cushitic and Chadic languages have preserved many very ancient Afroasiatic features. More recent scholars would do well to follow the great African linguist Karl Meinhof who wrote in 1915:
At the present time there is a tendency among philologists to consider some of the “Hamitic” languages of Africa as greatly worn-down Semitic languages. I cannot accept this view. Since the Hamitic languages possess living forms which appear in the Semitic as mere rudimentary survivals, I think we are justified in assuming the former to be more ancient.3
Vycichl was more tolerant when he considered Semitic languages. He drew attention to what he called the “astonishing” correspondence between what he reconstructs as the early Egyptian nati|r and the Ge’ez naki|r “pilgrim, stranger, other” with an adjective manker “miraculous, amazing.”4 Apart from the last, the semantic parallels are far less impressive than the phonetic ones from Bilen and Kwara.
Ntr > [Anqo", etc. In their critique of my work, Jasanoff and Nussbaum found my proposal that ntr was “given five different phonetic treatments in Greek” to be absurd and outrageous.5 Parallels from varying manifestations of Chinese loans into Japanese or Romance loans into English, however, make the number in itself unexceptionable. For instance, English has borrowed often and separately from two Vulgar Latin words: camera “arch, vault” and cantare “to sing.” From camera comes “chamber” through the French and the legal term in camera through Italian. From camera obscura (darkened room with a double lens as the only source of light) we derive the modern photographic apparatus called a “camera.” Even more phonetically distinct derivations come from cantare: whining “cant” from Northern French; “cantata” from the Italian; “chant” and, finally, “sea shanty,” said to be from the Modern French imperative chantez.6 In these cases we have a reasonably detailed knowledge of the development of Romance dialects and the periods of borrowings. If all we knew were the Latin canere “to sing” and camera “vault” and the English “chant,” “cant,” “cantata” “shanty,” and “chamber” and “camera,” we would merely have groups of words with vague semantic and phonetic resemblances without the precise regularities traditional Indo



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 247
Europeanists require. Yet, they are all certain borrowings from Romance languages!7 For an east Asian parallel, see the character for “lark” or “pipit” pronounced lìu in modern Chinese. It has eight different on (Chinese) readings in Japanese; ryu r–u, bo,–hyu,–mu, kyu, gu, and ryo.–Thus, unlike Jasanoff and Nussbaum, I have no difficulty in believing that the Egyptian ntr, which is more complicated phonetically than the prototype of lìu, could have had “five distinct phonetic treatments.” Therefore, we should look at the proposed etymologies from ntr individually. The most important proposed derivation, that of the Greek ánthos requires some explanation. The Indo-European etymology claimed for ánthos is from a hypothetical root *andh or *anedh “to stand out, sprout, bloom.” Pokorny derived this root from ánthos itself and such far-fetched forms as the Tocharian å nt “plain.”8 The only member of the cluster that has a possible semantic parallel with ánthos is the Sanskrit ándhah the magic “soma plant,” which was supposed to confer immortality. Frisk maintains that any connection between ánthos and ándhah is “unprovable” and Chantraine doubts it altogether.9 The case for a derivation of ánthos from the Egyptian ntr is much stronger. On the phonetic side, final -r was unstable even in Middle Egyptian.10 The -r in ntr vanished altogether in the Coptic nute. This vanishing does not necessitate an introduction after the first half of the Second Millennium as the final -r may have existed in Greek. The word cluster around anthos contains several forms with a final –r: antharion “pimple,” antheros “flowery,” antherikos “asphodel” and “awn or beard of wheat, or the ear itself.” Ajqhvr (H) “pointed ear of wheat,” was a sacred symbol of Osiris in Egypt and of the Eleusinian Mysteries in Greece.11 Ntr “divine” would be entirely appropriate, for this. Despite the fact that in most of these cases the -r could be morphological, a possibility remains that it is part of the root that has been dropped elsewhere. A prothetic ˆ- can be seen in the Coptic plural forms ente\r, (B) nte\r (S) “gods.” In Natural History Pliny wrote that jaqavrh (2) a “flour casserole?” was “an Egyptian word.”12 Chantraine writes that this derivation appears to be confirmed by the word’s attestation on a papyrus. He insists, however, that “this proves nothing about the etymology,” not that he can find one himself. While he denies any connection with athe\r, he admits that popular etymology could have associated the two forms. The use of flour pastes in the rituals around the death and vegetable rebirth of Osiris makes Pliny’s claim very strong indeed.13



248 BLACK ATHENA
As for semantics, the nineteenth-century Egyptologist, Heinrich Brugsch maintained that ntr was “the operative power which created and produced things by periodical occurrence and gave them new life and restored them to the freshness of youth.”14 It would be good to report that Egyptologists have progressed in the definition of ntr since then, but the vagueness or multivalence of the term continues to baffle them. Many of the “wisdom texts” suggest a single god in one place but elsewhere use the plural ntrw, suggesting a full panoply of gods.15 In some senses ntr (w) is/are transcendent but more often they are immanent not only in the sun, moon and air but also in the earth and Nile. Central to their nature is the sense of transformation and renewal—h°prw.16 Flowers are obvious symbols of such renewal. In Greece ánthos did not mean merely “flower” but also “growth, flower of youth.” There are many indications that Egyptians saw flowers as having deep religious significance. For example, virtually every representation of a sacrifice or offering shows flowers prominently, often tied to the head of the sarcophagus being adored. It is also clear from Egyptian religious texts that flowers could represent the gods or the blessed dead. Furthermore, as the Egyptologist Hans Bonnet put it, “their significance does not stop here. It goes deeper. The gods themselves are present in the bouquets.”17 Flowers and the blessed dead were also linked in Archaic and Classical Greece.18 The Ionian festival of Anthesteria was held when flowers began to bloom in February. While it was celebrated, the Ker–es “spirits of the dead” (the Egyptian etymology of which will be discussed below) were supposed to rise from their graves and walk the streets.19 This myth illustrates the associations with renewal and immortality. Similar festivals were held at Delphi and Corinth during the same season.20
Sntr, xavnqo". A derivation of ánthos from ntr is strengthened by other related etymologies. The first example is xanthos from sntr (sonte in Coptic, itself probably from the active participle *santir). Sntr is the causative sattached to the root ntr. Hence it meant “to make holy” but took on the specific meaning of “to consecrate through fire and incense.” It is through the scented smoke wafting upwards that humans can reach the gods. Even more specifically, sntr referred to the resin of the Syrian terebinth tree, which was used as incense.21 We can then turn to the etymological procedure of Wörter und Sachen “words and things” relating language to other types of evidence, as advocated by Jacob Grimm.22 We know from the famous fourteenth-century BCE shipwreck at Ulu Burun off the south



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 249
ern coast of Turkey that sntr was imported into Greece in large quantities during the Bronze Age.23 The resin varied in color from brown to yellow. The terebinth tree, tevrminqo" (4)/ terevbinqo" (LXX), can plausibly be derived from *dÅb ntr “sacred fig” especially since términthos is used in medicine to describe a tumor, while suvkon sy ́kon “fig” has the same subordinate meaning.24 Chantraine, having no etymology, assigns terevbinqo" to the substrate. (For the idea of a sacred fig tree, see below.) If the Egyptian etymology *dÅb ntr is correct the liquid /Å/ requires that it must antedate the first attestations by many centuries. The phonetic objection to the derivation of xanthos from sntr comes from the initial /x/ and from the possibility that the Mycenaean name Kasato means Xanthos. The initial /k/ in /ks/, however, may have been a soft fricative rather than a plosive.25 Thus, we cannot rule out the transcription of loans from words with uncertain Egyptian and Semitic sibilants as ks, or for that matter ps, in Greek.26 In contrast to the slight phonetic difficulty, the semantic correspondence between sntr and xanthos is excellent. The Greek word means “brown, yellow” and “sacred,” particularly of hair.27 It also has connotations of fragrance, especially of cooked meats, and of latex—last drops thrown into a basin with a splash. It is also noteworthy that, according to the writer of the Iliad, in the “language of the gods” Xanthos was the name of the river in the Troad. It was considered the holy child of Zeus.28 Most unusually for a river, Xanthos was associated with fire and flame.29 The river fought on the Trojan side with Apollo, Artemis and Leto and was considered powerful enough to be a match for Hephaistos.30 In this battle Homer painted the vivid picture of the river on fire.31 At another point, the river is described as reflecting the fires in front of Troy.32 According to Homer, the counterpart of the divine Xanthos was given in the language of men, as Skavmandro".33 In Chapter 13, I shall discuss Greek renditions of Semitic sibilants. One of the renditions of the Semitic /s=/ is /sk/. Thus, the consonantal structure of Skamandros is ÷s=mn indicating the west Semitic god Es=mun, the counterpart of Apollo, and the river Ismenos in Boiotia and the cult of Apollo Ismenios there.34 As mentioned above, Xanthos does not refer merely to color. The quality is clearly desirable. It has connotations of divinity and magic and is associated with the brightness of flames, cooking and aromas. Although there is no reason to doubt that Akhilles’ hair described as xántho\was tawny, in fact the color fits his image as a lion.35 The hair was also sacred, having been dedicated by his father to the river Sperkheios, where it was



250 BLACK ATHENA
ritually burnt.36 It is unlikely that xantho, applied to divinities like Demeter or heroes like Menelaos, merely meant that they had “fair hair.” Rather, it chiefly signified their divine nature. Another indication that the basic meaning of xanthos was “consecrated through fire” and that “yellow” was secondary comes from a calendrical and mythological complex. The first aspect of this is the use of the stem xanth- in the Macedonian festival of XanqikavXanthiká and the month name Xandikov" Xandikós or Xanqikov" Xanthikós, which appears to have been in early spring. This use of the stem may provide a link to another apparent rendering of sntr, the divinity known as Sandon, Sandan, Santas or Santa. The alternation d/t is easily explained because in the Late Egyptian and Anatolian languages dentals were neutralized. Sandon was worshipped both in Lydia, not far from the divine river Xanthos in the Troad, and in Cilicia. Sandon’s most famous cult center in the latter place was at Tarsus, where an effigy of him was burnt annually on a great pyre, which James Frazer says was used as an emblem of the city on its coinage.37 The cult had many distinctively Anatolian features but was clearly related to that of the Tyrian Melqart, seen by the Greeks as Herakles. Melqart’s image was burnt annually in Tyre, probably in connection with a festival known in Greek as the “awakening of Herakles.” It was held in early spring and concerned resurrection.38 In a wider sense the burning of Sandon/Santas can be linked to a series of cults and festivals from Babylon to Cadiz. According to Frazer, they were all sanctified through fire.39 He also pointed to the festivals of Herakles held with pyres to commemorate his fiery death on Mt. Oita.40 A more specific connection between xanthos and Melqart-HeraklesSandon regards quails and pigeons. Aristophanes described a roast pigeon as “beautiful and xanthos” in a context that suggests it meant “savory” rather than “yellow.”41 In a Greek explanation of the sacrifice of quails to the Phoenician Herakles, the story went that he had been killed in Libya by Typhon.42 Clearly, this explanation refers to Osiris’ murder by Seth, for whom the late Greek name was Typhon and whose home was supposed to have been in Libya. Herakles was saved when his faithful servant Iovlao" put a roasted quail under his nose and he was revived by the delicious smell. Hence, the riddle “why is a quail stronger than Herakles?” The story, of course, resembles the normal arousal of a god’s interest by the fragrance of offerings and incense.43 Frazer plausibly linked this sacrifice and myth to the annual migration of quails across the eastern Mediterranean in March, associating them with the spring and divine



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 251
resurrection. He further pointed out that some of the coins of Tarsus portraying the pyre have the inscription jortu±goqhvra “quail hunt,” which “may refer to the custom of catching quails and putting them on a pyre.”44 Thus, Sandon/Santas, Xanthiká and xanthos are plausible associated. All are linked by the themes of fire and consecration, the significance of sntr. Even many centuries later when the word was clearly a color term, Plato described it as a “mixture of flame red and white brightness.”45 Returning to the basic meaning of sntr as “made sacred”: The learned Kallimakhos referred to the ancient city of Troizen as xavnqoio. The scholiast explained it as coming from the name Xanthos of a king of the city—one not mentioned in any other source. Wilamowitz translated it as “the town of fairhaired Troizen!” The scholar who seems closest to the interpretation of xanthos in this context simply as “sacred” is Meineke who suggested substituting zaqevoio.46 Chantraine places zavqeo" (H) ”most holy” in the cluster with the intensifying prefix za-. While he may be correct, it is difficult to resist the possibility of deriving this too from sntr.
All in all, in the derivation sntr >xanthos, the phonetic correspondence is reasonable and the semantic fit intricate and convincing. Furthermore, neither Frisk nor Chantraine accept any of the previously proposed IndoEuropean etymologies.
Sntr Sivntie" Sintoiv. In the first book of the Iliad, Homer retells Hephaistos’ description of being brutally cast out of Olympos by Zeus. The smith god fell to earth on his volcanic island of Lemnos to be looked after by the faithful Sinties, described elsewhere as the original inhabitants of the island.47 It is sometimes supposed that Sinties referred to “bandits” coming from the stem sin- “pillage” discussed below.48 With the combination of holiness and fire, a derivation from sntr is much more likely. With no obligation to explain names, neither Frisk nor Chantraine provide an etymology for the Sinties.
Sntr Savturoi, Savtrai. Other derivations from sntr includes Sátyroi “Satyrs” and Satrai “a tribe in Thrace.” Frisk tentatively suggests that these names come from within Greek or are loans from Illyrian. Chantraine sees the two names as linked and as loans into Greek. More cautiously, he says that they have no assured etymology. Astour suggests that they derive from the Semitic root ÷str “ravage, destroy.”49 While the phonetic parallel is excellent, the semantics are vague compared to a



252 BLACK ATHENA
derivation from sntr. All scholars agree that both Satyrs and the Satrai were linked to the cult of Dionysos and are connected with phallic or priapic cults.50 The idea of Egyptian influences on names around the northern Aegean is made less absurd by the place names Abydos and Priapos and their associations with Osiran priapic cults discussed in the previous chapter.51 No great phonetic objections exist to this etymology. The medial -n- was often dropped in Greek transcription of Egyptian words or names.52 Also, -n- was sometimes assimilated to a following dental within Greek.53
*BÅ sntr, Brevnqo", Penqov". In Coptic and Egyptian compound words with an accented first element the second element was strongly reduced. In this way the name of the class of Egyptian priests called  ̇m ntr, and in Coptic *hom and nute, became the attested form hont.54 The cluster of Greek words around brevnqo" (6) has bewildered lexicographers. It contains the meanings “aquatic bird, proud, arrogant, perfume, plant, tomb.” Frisk writes straightforwardly, “All etymologies are in reality floating in the air.” Chantraine states:
If one starts with the bird’s name, there is no etymology. For those aspects concerning plants and perfume a non-Indo-European origin is plausible. It is possible that among the words we have assembled in this article one should distinguish two groups with independent origin, on the one hand the bird and arrogance, on the other the names of plants or perfumes.
Neither scholar deals with Hesykhios’ equation of brenthos and tumbos as “tomb.” The various meanings of brenthos can find a single source from Egyptian. The bÅ or Ba was one of the many Egyptian souls, particularly of the risen dead or of the soul that flies out of the tomb later returning to
nourish the body. It was originally written G (G29), a bird commonly associated with the jabiru stork.55 From the Eighteenth Dynasty this sign
began to be alternated with a number of different signs, notably Ω (G53). Egyptologists see it merely as a variant writing of bÅ. As Gardiner points
out, this glyph is made up of two parts: a human-headed Ba bird and `z
(R7) “brazier” sntr.56 In his detailed study of the Ba, Louis Zabkar refers to the increased emphasis in the New Kingdom and “late” inscriptions on Bas flying to heaven and becoming deified ntr or sntr. He does not mention the adoption of the new hieroglyph.57 On the basis of what I



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 253
see as Greek derivations, I am convinced that as with © *kÅ ntr (discussed in the next section) both elements of the hieroglyph could be treated
phonetically. In this case Ω could be read *bÅ(s)ntr. The phonetic parallel with brenthos is good, especially if the word arrived in Greek before the weakening of medial -s- in the middle of the Second Millennium. A consonantal realization of the /Å/ would also indicate an early borrowing. The semantic match is precise. Ba as bird or striding stork explains the arrogance. As with sntr as xanthos, sntr in *bÅsntr signified incense and perfume, particularly with that of myrrh which is associated with death, burial and the tomb. Ba birds fly around tombs. The idea that the concept and word could have been introduced by the middle of the Second Millennium is reinforced iconographically by Mycenaean representations of soul birds. Emily Vermeule clearly derived these from the Egyptian bÅ.58 She wrote, “There is little doubt that the Egyptian Ba-soul was the model for the Greek soul-bird and for its mythological offshoots, the Siren and the Harpy, both of whom had intense and often sustaining relations with the dead.”59 Seirh`ne", Sirens, provide a link between soul birds and mourning. Chantraine describes the etymology of the name as “obscure.” Neither he nor Frisk mentions Lewy’s proposal to derive it from the Semitic *s(s)=îr h≥e–n. “song of grace.”60 The correspondence between s(s=)îr and the Sirens, whose chief and only quality is their singing, is undeniable. The second element, however, is more controversial. Victor Bérard preferred
*s(s)=îr.>an “song of entrapment.”61 He claims that this is a widespread Semitic root, but I can find it only in Aramaic. Seire@n has now been found in Mycenaean, which makes a loan from that language unlikely. Another possibility is from the root ÷>an “groan, mourn.” In Hebrew it is >ånåh or >ånah≥ in Arabic >anna. Vermeule, in her book Death in Early Greek Art, illustrates an Attic black-figured bowl with modeled mourners on the rim and painted Sirens around the bowl itself.62 She pointed out, in the quotation given above, that Sirens had “intense and often sustaining relations with the dead.” For instance, they possessed a “flowery meadow,” leimw`n ajnqemoenta.63 Vermeule also describes a Mycenaean coffin from Tanagra, illustrated with a picture of “a bird stalking through a flowery meadow behind two soldiers.”64 This brings one back to the Egyptian paradise, or Sh°t ˆÅrw “Field of Rushes,” discussed later in this chapter.65 As a child, my father was disappointed when he first heard nightin

gales. He had hoped and assumed that they would sing like people! Nevertheless, many cultures, including those speaking Semitic and Greek languages, refer to bird “song.” Lewy and Bérard both mention the term used in Qohelet, bEnôt has=si=r, literally “daughters of song.”66 They see this term as a parallel to the Sirens. The verse, however, refers to chirping sparrows. Thus, most commentators see bEnôt has=si=r as referring to birds singing. Furthermore these birds are frequently associated with mourning. The mourning dove is not the only bird with this association. In addition, mourners can become or represent birds. In Egypt Isis and Nepthys, mourning Osiris, were the drty “two kites” represented at funerals by women.67 Apollodoros refers twice to mourners being turned into birds.68 Thus song, birds and mourning seem tightly entangled symbols in both Egypt and Greece, with the Ba, or soul bird, at the center. Lexicographers subsume the word Penqov" (H) “mourning,” penqevw “I mourn” and other derivatives under pavscw ”experience” or “suffer.” Despite the /a/ sometimes /o/ in paskho,–they justify the /e/ in penthos by the future form peivsomai. The semantic gap between paskho\and penthos is even greater than the phonetic one. A derivation from *BÅsntr after the loss of the consonantal /Å/ would seem more likely. The chief difficulty would be the required dropping of the medial /s/ after the general shift in Greek. Michael Astour points out that the mythical Pentheus torn apart by the Bakkhai is a doublet of Dionysos, who was himself known as Bakkhos or Bakkheus. Astour plausibly derives that name from the West Semitic båku\y “bewailed,” the passive participle of the verb ÷bky. He sees this as a Semitic-Greek doublet.69 I see it as an Aegypto Egyptian-Semitic doublet in Greek. In Chapter 18 I shall make a case for deriving the name of the Latin god Li–ber, another equivalent of Dionysos and Bakkhos, from rmij“weep” in Egyptian.70
*KÅ ntr; kavnqaro", kaqarov". At this point we should turn to an alternation between retention and loss of the -n- in ntr that can be seen in the two semantically related words kántharos and katharós. Frisk finds no “acceptable” etymology for either and Chantraine also provides none, although he tentatively proposes that kántharos comes from “the substrate.” Katharós means “clean, purge, pure.” Kántharos signifies “a scarab, a type of fish, a type of boat, plant, the mark on the tongue of an Apis bull and a cup with large handles.” Szemerényi plausibly derives kántharos in the last sense from the Akkadian kanduru “cup with large handles”71 Accepting



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 255
this etymology, however, still leaves a bewildering number of other meanings unexplained. Two of these, “a scarab” and “the mark on the tongue of an Apis bull,” have clear connections not merely with Egypt but specifically with Egyptian religion. Thus, the semantics of the Greek word would seem to require an Egyptian etymon that is both vague and religious. I believe that this can be found in the Egyptian *kÅ ntr “holy spirit.” The asterisk is there because Egyptologists do not recognize such a form.
As with their failure to distinguish G from Ω, they see the frequently
used hieroglyph © (D29) simply as an alternative for kÅ Ì “soul, spirit.”
The bottom section c(R12) iÅt “standard” is a sign widely used to
designate divinities; ntr is the standard word for this sign. Thus, ©as a sign for the combination *kÅntr would seem very likely. This hypothesis is strengthened by two Coptic words kte\r or kater “calf,” possibly linked to the Apis bull, and kente (B) kente\(F) and knte (S) “fig, sacred tree,” deriving from *kunte.72 An etymology from *kÅntr “holy spirit” would also seem plausible for katharós and such derivatives as kathársis. A parallel for this type of structure are the forms KÅ h≥tp “contented kÅ” and *kÅ h≥kÅ “magic kÅ.” Erman and Grapow plausibly envisaged the latter term.73
*KÅ ntr; Kavanqo", Kuvnqo", Kavnaqo", Kevntauro". Other Greek renditions of *kÅ ntr with different vocalizations include Kaanthos, Kanathos, Kynthos, and Kentauros. Kaanthos and Kanathos were remarkably similar heroes. According to Pausanias, Kaanthos’ tomb was by the spring of Ares near the temple of Apollo Ismenios outside Thebes. This location is also associated with Kadmos’ struggle with a dragon.74 Just as Kadmos pursued Europa, Kaanthos searched for his sister Mevlia in vain. Before continuing with Kaanthos we should consider Melia. The two were children of Ocean. The early twentieth-century scholar Antonios Keramopoullos identified Melia as the original name of the spring known as Ares.75 Given her watery connections, which will be discussed further in the next section, this identification seems plausible. Chantraine provides no etymology, but Melia’s name seems to derive from the Egyptian mr “canal, artificial lake.” A cognate word mr “libation trough, metal vessel” appears in Greek as mevlh (4) “type of cup.” Melia was the first of the Melian nymphs. An ancient tradition going back to Hesiod traces the nymph’s name to meliva–“ash tree,” which sprouted from the blood of Uranos’ severed genitals.76 Given the parallel of the Dryads “oak nymphs,” this tradition is inherently plausible. On the other hand, Melia’s



256 BLACK ATHENA
association with a spring coupled with the fact (stressed in Chapter 9 and discussed further in Chapter 11) that nymphs are in general concerned with water make it hard to deny a strong possibility that there was at least paronomasia or punning involved here.77 After Kaanthos failed to rescue his sister, his story diverged from that of Kadmos. He found that she had been abducted by Apollo, so in fury he burnt Apollo’s temple. The god then shot him with an arrow, hence the tomb.78 Joseph Fontenrose pointed out that a papyrus found at Oxyrhynchus told a similar story in which Ismenios (Apollo) killed a certain Klaaitos. Fontenrose sees this name as a “corruption of Kaanthos, which itself could be a corrupt form.”79 A source that would explain both names is *kÅ ntr. The use of /Å/ as a liquid suggests that Klaaitos was the earlier form, but it could also be an archaism. Kánathos appears to have been a hero connected with a spring of that name near Lerna in the Argolid. The spring is the one in which Hera washed every year to renew her virginity.80 This association brings the name closer to katharos and katharsis “purify.” Kaanthos’ association with the spring also makes sense if it too derived from *kÅ ntr “holy spirit.”
*kÅ ntr; Kuvnqo". Mount Kynthos, one of the most holy sites in the Aegean, was the legendary birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. The mountain is on the sacred island of Delos, also the site of a temple of Zeus, who is seen as looking over the birth of his children.81 (This topic will be treated further in Chapter 19.) It will be noted that all the previously proposed derivations of *kÅ ntr have been vocalized with an /a/. The ambiguities of this vocalization, seen in manuscript variants of the adjectival Kuvnqio" of Kauvqio" or Kavnqio", probably resulted from an
earlier *kwar, which was discussed in Chapter 5.82
*kÅ ntr; Kevntauroi. The familiar image of a centaur is of the kindly hybrid horse-man Kheíro–n, the instructor of Aesculapius in the art of healing. Despite the fact that their name ends in -taur, nothing associates centaurs with bulls, although an association with bulls may have altered the shape of the word. In Homer the centaurs were simply a savage race, known for their ferocity and their emnity to mankind and above all for their scattering after unsuccessful battles with the Lapithai.83 On the other hand, their image would fit well with riders originally living on the Thessalian Plain. Homer described Kheíro–n as “the best of the centaurs” and as a teacher of medicine.84 Kentauros had other meanings:



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 257
“brutal paedophilia” from the behavior of centaurs. Its use for “pudenda” is less easy to explain in this way. Kentauriv" was the name of a medicinal herb and of a type of earring. Thus, very much as with kantharos, the many varied meanings suggest a vague original term. The euphemistic use of a “sacred” word to describe wild outsiders would parallel the names Satyroi and Satrai referred to above. Similarly, the Egyptian use TÅ ntr “holy land” for a belt of distant countries ranging from Pwnt in Africa to northern Syria and Anatolia.85
KÅ; kavr, and khvr. Now, to turn to kÅ itself, Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s
initial critique of my derivation of Greek ka\rv/ke\rvfrom the Egyptian kÅ is that I rely on an interpretation of /Å/ as a liquid. (This has been discussed above, in Chapter 8.86) They objected, too, on the additional
grounds that dialectical distribution indicated that ke\rvwas not merely the result of the shift å>e–in Attic and Ionic. Rather, it had existed independently. These different forms they explained as follows:
Both vocalisms are easily accounted for under the standard assumption of a PIE “root noun” *ke–vr (nom.sg.), *kr≥r-és (gen. sg.), literally “a cutting (off), a termination” (cf. keíro\<*ker-yo–“I cut”). Such a verbal noun—perfectly regular in PIE terms—would have yielded an early Greek paradigm *ke–vr, *kar-ós the weak stem of which (*kar-) was taken as a departure for the creation of a new
nom. sg. ka\rvin some dialects.87
Unfortunately, for all its professional mystification, this cumbersome “standard” explanation is not accepted by the “standard” etymological lexicographers, Frisk writes that the solution to the dialect pattern is “perhaps
possible.” Chantraine, is more skeptical and concludes the lemma on ke\rv with the statement “the word remains obscure.” The long /e–/ in other dialects is not straightforward. The recon
struction of kÅ as *kwar, given in Chapter 5, however, makes its rendition into Greek uncertain. In any event, at the risk of misplaced precision, the Greek vocalic alternation could be explained as the result of hesita
tion in Egyptian between the initial /kw *ku–r>ke–r and the following /a/ *ka–r explaining an earlier borrowing into Greek.88 In any event, given the possibilities of cultural influence from the ke\res on Homer or Attic Greek a demand for this kind of precision is inappropriate. Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s semantic arguments are equally flimsy. Chantraine cites an article by the classicist J. N. Lee who argued that ke\r



258 BLACK ATHENA
was less “death and ruin” but more “fate.”89 More importantly, in Black Athena 2 (263–264), I wrote
The Greek ke\rv. . . , is a term of rich and complex religious significance. There is no doubt that it came to mean “fate, doom, or violent death.” However, . . . Homer was also using it in a different sense of individual fate or “soul.” This, according to one passage in the Iliad, was appointed to a man at birth to meet him at his death.[90] This same sense was preserved in the ancient formula used in the Athenian festival of Anthesteria—in which the souls of the dead revisit the living—“get out ke–res the Anthesteria is
over.”[91] Thus, this sense of ke\rvas an individual soul would seem to be central to its original meaning . . . .
The concept of kÅ, commonly written ka, which is central to Egyptian theology, has an even richer semantic field. [To paraphrase the Egyptologist Peter Kaplony:] As the hieroglyph
Ì, represented open or embracing arms, the original meaning of
ka would seem to be one of relations between beings: god and god; god and man; man and man. In the sense of father and son, it gained connotations of personal and institutional continuity and immortality.[92]
At a less abstract level, Adolph Erman defined kÅ in the following way in his dictionary: “a) The ka was born with a man and had human form, in particular arms with which it protectively embraced men. b) The ka is the companion of a man to whom the man goes at his death.” Erman notes that in Demotic kÅ is frequently associated with s=Åy “fate.”93 Thus,
the semantic fit between ke\rvand kÅ is nearly perfect and, given the equality of the phonetic ones, the Afroasiatic etymology is to be preferred over an Indo-European origin.
2. Œn∆ (ankh)
Alan Bomhard postulates a Nostratic root, Œan-ah°or ŒEn-ah°“to breath, to respire, to live.” In Indo-European he finds examples of this in the Sanskrit ániti, ánati “breathe” and the Latin anima “breath wind” and
animus “soul.”94 The Afroasiatic example was the Egyptian Œnh°(ankh). œ (S34). It was, and remains, one of the most potent symbols of life in



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 259
Ancient Egyptian and many later cultures.95 More than a dozen attempts at explaining the origin of the sign have been tried, and the conventional view is that the sign derives from a sandal strap.96 In 1982, however, two veterinary surgeons, Calvin Schwabe and Joyce Adams, joined the linguist and Egyptologist Carleton Hodge to provide a new and more plausible derivation:97 the upside down thoracic vertebra of a humped bull. This explanation fits two features of Ancient Egyptian culture: first, the centrality of cattle and the use of cattle parts in hieroglyphics to represent those of humans; second, the belief that the spine leading to the phallus was the source of life. This is not to deny that the rebus or punning principle was employed so the sign could be used for words with the consonants Œnh°with different meanings and different etymologies. It should be expected that such an important and frequently used set of words should have had an effect beyond Egypt and some of these, which were transmitted into Greek, will be discussed below. At this point, however, I shall consider a compound in which Œnh°has the basic meaning of “life.”
Œnh;° ( ̧)a[nax, ( ̧)a[nakto". The Bronze Age title for king is attested in Linear B as wanaka, dative wanakate, and in Homer as ( ̧) a[nax. The (w)anax held an exalted position, far above basileus, which, during the Second Millennium, only meant “minister, vizier.”98 Anax has many derivatives, usually with the root anass-, concerned with kingliness and rule. It has a cognate in the Phrygian wanakt, about which Chantraine wrote, however, that it “must be borrowed from Greek.” Conventional wisdom has held that the stem was *wanak, but Szemerényi has forcefully maintained that the stem was *wanakt and that only from a cluster kty could one explain the derived forms with an /s/, the feminine wanassa and the verb wanasso\“rule.” On the other hand, I do not think that one can easily dismiss the testimony of the tablets that the stem was originally wanaka(t), although the final -a- may have been syncopated later to become wanakt. In any event, Szemerényi went on to say, “The next and decisive question is of course: what can we say about the origin of this term? The unanimous answer seems to be: nothing, the word is “unerklärt,” “étymologie inconnue.” At most the suspicion is voiced that it is a loan word.”99 Szemerényi then proposed his own etymology from an Indo-European word root *wen “kin, tribe” and ag “lead” with t- as an agental suffix. The /e/ in *wen was transformed by euphony into *wan.100 Szemerényi is explicit about his motive for proposing this seemingly far-fetched origin: “And the IE origin of this term would very nicely



260 BLACK ATHENA
agree with the finding that  ̧anvax was succeeded in the sense of ‘king’ by the substratum word basileuv".” As I explained in Chapter 9, I see basileus as coming not from the substratum, but from Egyptian.101 The Egyptian etymology I propose is from Œnh°dt “may he live forever.” This formula was normally placed after the names of living pharaohs. It was even treated as an independent noun phrase as in the common conclusion to dedicatory inscriptions irr.f Œnh(°w) dt “may he make; he lives eternally.”102 Other uses of the Greek stem (w)anaka(t) also indicate a connection with Œnh:° Ajnaktovrion Anaktorion is generally supposed to mean “royal dwelling.” In fact, however, the word was used exclusively in connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries with their strong Egyptian connections.103 Furthermore, as Plutarch and others made clear, the chamber itself was relatively small with an opening on its roof and high up within the building. The space contained the hiera “sacred objects” of the mysteries; these could only be seen by the chief priest or hierophant.104 This name can plausibly be derived from the Egyptian euphemistic use of Œnh°as “sarcophagus, that of the living,” used particularly of Osiris. The “sarcophogous” contained objects of great sanctity. The whole was central to the Osiran Mysteries.105 Linked to this word is the ojgkivon a box or chest in which Odysseus kept iron and bronze axes.106 Frisk and Chantraine derive this from [ogko" “weight or mass.” Anaktos is used as an adjective to describe water drawn from a spring, a meaning still further removed from “royalty.” It can, however, be plausibly derived from mw Œnh°“the water of life” that Osiris gives to the soul.107 One should consider the gift of spring water to the soul referred to in Orphic texts.108 In the same context there is the snatch from the lost early epic, the Danais referring to the ejurrei'o" potavmou Nei?loio ajnavkto".109 Given the Greek trope of the life-giving and life-sustaining power of the Nile, the ajnavkto" here would seem much more likely to refer to “living” than to “royal.”110 The idea of fresh or “living,” as opposed to other waters, also appears in the common Hebrew expression mayîm h≥ayîm “living” or “running” water.111 Another likely loan into Greek from Œnh°is [Inaco"—Inakhos. This name has both royal and fluvial connotations. In The Suppliants Aiskhylos describes him as a divinity, a river and as the founder of the royal line of Argos.112 In this passage the playwright draws a clear distinction between the Greek Inakhos and the Egyptian Nile. Where the principal meaning



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 261
of Argos on the Inakhos, however, is “silver,” Memphis, which is on the Nile, is also known as ˆnb h≥d, “silver walls.”113 The name Inakhos has no Indo-European etymology and is thought to be “pre-Greek.” Thus the semantic fits, between Œnh°(w) dt and (w)ánax (w)ánaktos and between Œnh°and Anaktórion “sarcophagus” and ánaktos as “living” are very good. Even the phonetic problems are not insuperable. An Egyptian or Semitic /h°/ was frequently rendered as a Greek /k/. This rendition is attested specifically for Œnh°in the derivation of Sfivgx, Sfigov", Sphínx, Sphingós, also rendered Sfivx, Sfikov", Sphíx, Sphikós, from S+spw Œnh° “living image.”114 The formula Œnh°(w) dt is an exclamatory use of the stative or old perfective. It is analogous to the Afroasiatic suffix or “nominal” conjugations which seemed to have had the vocalization CaCaC(a), the Semitic qat≥ala.115 There are two phonetic difficulties: The first is the third-person suffix -w found in Œnh°(w). The brackets indicate it was seldom written and Vycichil reconstructs Œnh°“may he live” as * Œ anh°a without the final -w and missing the medial -a-.116 The second, and more serious, problem is with the derivation of the initial Greek digamma  ̧ w- in (w)anax from an Egyptian Œayin.117 There are, however, some interesting correspondences between this pharyngeal fricative and the semivowel in both Semitic and Egyptian. The identity of the Akkadian sign for /u/ with the Ugaritic sign for Œayin, which corresponded to the linear Canaanite O. The Ugaritic letter is also once attested as representing a vocalic /o/.118 Egyptian has several correspondences between /w/ and /Œ/. These include ŒÅ and wr as two near homonyms for “great” and Œd “hack up” and Œdt “slaughter” and wdŒ “cut, chords, head” etc. There are also the pairs Œd “be safe” and wŒdÅ “whole uninjured, safe” and ŒbÅ “present in a ritual manner” and wŒb “pure or priest.” The last is one of a large number of Egyptian words in which /w/ and /Œ/ appear jointly in the initial position. In Coptic, etymological /Œ/ was frequently vocalized as /o/ or /w/. In 1947 Gardiner assumed that pr Œnh°“house of life” or “house of documents” [university?] should be vocalized in Late Egyptian as Pi Œonkh, even though he had previously discussed a Coptic form frans=.119 Nevertheless, the normal form of the Coptic verb “to live” was o\ nh. Thus, there is little difficulty in postulating an earlier vocalization of *wŒana∆a dt as an etymon for *wanakat. The -t s in Ajnaktovrion and a[nakto" “living” would be by analogy. It is not surprising that Mycenaean rulers wanted to imitate Egyptian



262 BLACK ATHENA
pharaohs. Such an indication would explain the Homeric phrase “honored by the people like a god” and possibly the scene on the Hagia Triada sarcophagus in which a person, probably dead, appears to be worshipped. The Wanax did seem to have important religious functions.120 As Astour points out, however, both Linear B documents and Homer indicate that in political reality the Aegean rulers, like those elsewhere in the Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean, had—to some extent at least—to share his power with other officials or traditional chiefs.121
A special meaning of Œnh°is “captive” › (A13) [taken alive rather than killed]. In Coptic anas= (SB) anah°(A) means “oath, something you are bound to.” Homer used ajnavgkh to convey “constraint,” among other instances in the image of Andromeche in slavery.122 It was later used in the more general sense of “necessity.” Chantraine dismisses all proposed etymologies for anánke\. Thus, despite the second /n/, here too a derivation from Egyptian is plausible. Ejnevcw can be explained simply as being “held” e[vcw “in” en. In what appears to be an extension of this, the stem ejnecur- means “pledge” and may well reflect contamination from Œnh.°
3. M(w)dw, mu'qo"
In 1953 the Soviet Coptologist P. V. Jernstedt proposed that the Greek mu'qo" (H) derived from the Egyptian m(w)dw.123 Mythos originally meant “succession of words with meaning, discourse.” Later it was restricted to “fiction, myth.”124 The Egyptian m(w)dw “words, discourse” could be used for both spoken and written words. Thus, mdw ntr was both the “the word of god” and “ sacred writings.” The masculine mdw was later displaced by the feminine form mdt. The Coptic verb mute, however, indicates that in some circumstances it kept its initial vowel, even though mdt in the sense of “casting a spell” was rendered mtau. Frisk supposes that mythos comes from an “onomatopoeic” mu with a suffix -thos. Chantraine is not impressed and describes its origin as “obscure.” In this situation an etymology from m(w)dw is very attractive in both its phonetics and sense.
4. SbÅ
Sofiva (H) Sofov". In its phonetics the hypothetical Indo-European root
*tuo÷a≤ouh÷ós, proposed by Brugmann and accepted by the lexicographers



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 263
Boisacq and Hoffmann, fits sophós quite well.125 This is not surprising since it was designed expressly for that purpose. The only non-Greek cognate Brugmann proposed was the Latin tuor “gaze.” In any event, the inherent improbability of this suggestion has led to Pokorny’s dropping the proposal.126 Frisk declared that the origin of sophos was “obscure” and Chantraine simply that it had “no etymology.” Despite the extreme rarity of native Greek words beginning with sV-, none of these scholars raise the possibility of a loan. Soph- and its many derivatives are all centered on the idea of “learned skill, teaching, learning.” The most obvious origin is from the Egyptian root sbÅ “to teach, teaching school, pupil.”127 In Middle Egyptian it is used as the verb “to teach” and as a noun with such different determinatives as “school, pupil” and, when appearing as sbÅyt, written “teaching instructions.” It is attested in Late Egyptian with the agental -w, as sbÅw “teacher.”128 The consonantal structure presents no problem. The borrowing is obviously late, clearly after the Greek shift s->h- and after /Å/ had lost its liquid value. Some problems arise with the vocalization. Vycichl lists five different Coptic derivations of the root: sbo,\ “teaching, education, intelligence,” the adjective sabe “wise, intelligent, judicious,” sbui “disciple, apprentice,” seb “intelligent, cunning” and sbo “to learn, teach.”129 The disappearance of the first vowel in sbo\, sbui and sbo suggests that it was previously short and unstressed. On the other hand, seb and a compound form -ze\b “school” suggests to Vycichl a derivation from a short /u/. In general, Coptic first vowels were short and unstressed as they are in the Greek sophía and sophós. The accented /í/ in sophía indicates a relationship to the -y- in sbÅyt. Although no single form provides an etymology for the Greek terms, the wide range of Egyptian vocalizations makes it easy to derive the Greek soph-. The excellent semantic fit is strengthened by the Greek association of wisdom in general, and filosofiva “philosophía” (6) in particular, with Egypt and Pythagoras who, according to all ancient authorities, had studied there. Cicero in the first century BCE stated that Pythagoras had called himself a philosophos not a sophos.130 Diogenes Laertius, and Clement of Alexandria of the second century CE agree that the first man to use the term philosophía was Pythagoras.131 Four hundred years before these writers, the orator Isokrates had specified, though in a parody, that Pythagoras had brought “all philosophy to the Greeks” from Egypt.132 The Coptic maisbo\“loving wisdom” was used as a translation of the



264 BLACK ATHENA
Greek philomátho\n “loving learning, curiosity.” The Greek philosophía would appear to be a calque not a borrowing, although philo–was an earlier loan from Egyptian.133
Sapio\, Sapie\ns. At the beginning of his discussion leading to the form
*tuo÷a≤ouh÷ós, Brugmann remarked that “the beloved placing together of sofov" with sapie\ns . . . should be . . . discarded.”134 Given the rules of genetic relationships within Indo-European he was absolutely right. The same strict rules do not apply, however, to loaning either from Greek or directly from Egyptian. The complication of the verb sapio,\ and of the cluster of words around it is that it contains two semantic overlapping, but not identical, fields: “to taste and discern” (from which “savor”) and “to know and be wise” (from which the French savoir). In the first sense it appears to have cognates in Germanic: the Old Saxon an-sebbian “to perceive, notice,” the Old High German int-seffen “to notice, taste.” There is, however, the Old Icelandic sefi “thought.” In its second semantic field, sapio\ had cognates in other Italic languages: the Oscan sipus and the Volscian sepu “knowing.” These cognates indicate that, if the word came from the Greek sophía or the Egyptian sbÅ, it arrived on the peninsula before Roman domination. There is no reason to suppose that the Latin form was more developed than the others, as its vocalization clearly fits a Greek and Egyptian prototype more closely than those, particularly in the second /i/. The initial a- would fit a loan from Egyptian very well. The second semantic field was clearly seen to resemble that of sophía and philósophia. Ennius, the earliest Latin playwright whose works are still extant, used sapie\ns to translate them. Thus, the second sense of sapio\clearly derives from Egyptian, and the Teutonic forms for the first meaning may also do so.
S≥abaeans?
The S≥abaeans, not to be confused with the Sabaeans from Sheba at the foot of the Red Sea, are one of the anomalies in early Islamic histories.135 They were mentioned in the Koran as a “People of the Book.” Michel Tardieu, who has written the most recent work on them, sees two communities: one based on Harran in what is now northern Iraq where Greco-Mesopotamian religion and culture survived until the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century CE. The other was of cultivated “pagans,” who survived and, for a while, flourished in Baghdad. This di



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 265
chotomy is confused by the fact that the best-known S≥abaean, the great ninth-century mathematician, astronomer and translator, Thabit ibn Kurra, moved from Harran to Baghdad.136 Interestingly, by that same century S≥abaeans were known to have taken the Egyptian Corpus Hermeticum as a holy scripture and generally to have assumed a “kind of Gnostic identity.137 Thus, it is plausible to suppose that the name S≥abaean derived from sbÅ ”wisdom.”
More ancient borrowings?
Sivbulla. Sibyls were prophetesses first attested in Anatolia but later found elsewhere around the Mediterranean. They uttered ecstatic oracles. What is striking about them is that so many of the prophecies were written down. As Walter Burkert puts it, “Sibyl oracles which last a thousand years probably played a leading role among written oracles . . .” [my italics]. Most long lasting were the libri Sibyllini—written in Greek—in Rome.138 The etymology of Síbylla is unknown. Frisk rejects previous attempts and Chantraine agrees with him that its origin is unknown. One possibility is that it derives from the Egyptian sbÅyt “written teaching, instructions” when the /Å/ still had consonantal value. If the parallels between the semantics and the consonantal structure of sbÅyt with Síbylla are very good, the correspondence of the vowels does not reach the same high level. Given the uncertainty of the first unstressed short vowel in sbÅyt Coptic sbo\, the /i/ in Síbylla is not a great impediment. The position of the /Å/ before the y is more serious. SbÅyt is consistently written in this way and, if anything, “narrow vertical signs
such as ii /y/ tend to precede the birds such as the a /Å/ that should follow them.”139 Therefore, a reading **sbyÅt is unlikely. Nevertheless, the general ease of metathesis with liquids, especially with vowels, allows the etymology to remain viable in the absence of any competitors. The derivation of Sibyl from sbÅyt is strengthened by the existence of lovgoi subari–tikoi “fables.” These are generally associated with the city of Sybaris in Lucania in southern Italy, which may have gained its name from another *sbÅ “variegated, luxury.”140 Finally, Pausanias mentions a Sibyl among the Jews of Palestine called Sabbe, thus bringing together two derivations of sbÅ.141
SbÅ. The centrality of astronomy in Egyptian intellectual culture is shown
by the fact that sbÅ is nearly always written with the star  ̊ (n14) either



266 BLACK ATHENA
as a triliteral or as a determinative.142 With this and A, the sign to represent the star, sbÅ was a surveying instrument for measuring the elevation of the sun and other heavenly bodies, an instrument significantly still known by its Greek name “gnomon.”143 The Greek term is derived from the verb gignwvskw “to know” and is, therefore, a calque on sbÅ. The adjective th≥nt is defined as “brilliant, flashing, jewel,” and as “blue green,” the color of faience.144 It also seems to have been the color of the bright sky and fragments of the firmament as they appeared on earth in the form of the green mineral, malachite (wÅd).145 This heavenly source also appears to have been seen as the origin of lapis lazuli (h°sbd), also the word for “blue.” In fact, the stone itself came from Afghanistan. Neither of these words appears to have traveled, but sbÅ, both as star and as firmament, has. For example, a Hebrew word sapîr “lapis lazuli” is isolated and is universally accepted to be a loan word. The conventional origin first proposed by the distinguished Semitist and notorious antiSemite Paul Lagarde is from the Sanskrit çanipriya “dear to Saturn, darkcolored stone.”146 Scholars also generally accept Lewy’s derivation of the Greek savpfeiro" (4) “lapis lazuli,” later “sapphire” from the Hebrew sapîr.147 The lexicographers of Greek doubt the Sanskrit etymology. Chantraine does not mention it and Frisk calls it “very questionable.” A derivation from sbÅ “star, pieces from the blue chrystaline firmament in which they were set” would seem much more plausible.
sbÅ sfai’ra. Frisk writes about sphaîra, “formation like peîra, speîra, moîra and the like without correspondences beyond Greek.”148 Naturally he meant within Indo-European. Many later writers attributed to Pythagoras and Anaximander the use of sphaîra to express the “sphere” or ring holding the planets and the stars around the world.149 The lexicographers maintain, however, that the basic meaning is “ball” and the earliest reference is in the Odyssey. Interestingly, all these references occur in Books 6 and 8, concerning the mysterious island of Scerivh. Scholars have long agreed that Skherie–was a location of the afterlife close to Hjluvsion, Elysium. Even though the concept of Elysium drew on other sources, the association with the Egyptian afterlife for the blessed elite, the Field of Rushes, was clear even to Martin Nilsson.150 Garth Alford rightly emphasizes the Egyptian component. Nevertheless, his claim that Hjluvsion can be derived from the Egyptian term Sh°t ˆÅrw “Field of Rushes” seems far-fetched.151 On the other hand, with the disappearance of the feminine -t, *Sh° ˆÅrw does provide a plausible etymology for



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 267
Skherie.152 The toponym for this mythical blessed island lacks an IndoEuropean etymology. The heavenly and stellar aspects of the Egyptian voyage of the dead are well known, and in many ways the Phaeaceans with their magic ships resemble stars. The best-known Homeric passage concerning sphaîra is the following:
Then Alcinous bade Halius and Laodamas dance alone, for no one could vie with them. And when they had taken into their hands the beautiful ball [sphaîra(n)] of purple (porphyree\n), whichwise Polybos[153]had made for them, the one would lean backwards and toss it toward the shadowy clouds, and the other would leap up and catch it before his feet touched the ground again. But when they tried their skill at throwing the ball straight up, the two fell to dancing on the bounteous earth, ever tossing the ball to and fro.154
This selection could be taken literally but, given the otherworldly nature of the Phaeacians and their stellar connotations as well as the later attestations of sphaîra as “sphere,” the dance could also have been symbolic. Hence, if one accepts the association of stars and their spheres, the semantic links between sbÅ and sphaîra are reasonably good. Similarly, that the first vowel in sbÅ was short and unstressed makes the phonetic case quite plausible.
Conclusion on sbÅ. Clearly, the quality of these derivations from sbÅ varies a great deal. The strongest, sophía/sophós, must be a loan; it has no Indo-European competitor and is semantically congruent. The derivations of savpfeiro" through the Canaanite sapir and the S≥abaeans are only a little less strong. The etymologies of sapio\, Sybil and sphaîra are weaker but still plausible. Even under a minimalist view, this important Egyptian stem has resonated significantly in Greek language and culture.
5. Dr, R-dr, drw
tevlo" (H), televw, tevllw (H), teleuth (H), th’le. The extraordinarily productive Greek stem tel- has the basic sense of “limit” sometimes in space but usually in time. It also includes the meaning of “to the limit, complete, fulfilled, perfect.” This is also one of the meanings of tello.\ Chantraine sees telos as a confusion of two words. The secondary meaning is similar to tello\in the sense “raise, lift.” Though Chantraine



268 BLACK ATHENA
does not mention it, this seems to me to derive from the Indo-European root *tel “to raise.”155 According to him, the primary sense of telos is “end,
term, goal.” The standard view is that this came from a labiovelar *kwel “wheel, revolve, journey, be, live,” in the sense of “turning point.” It was supposedly represented in Greek by tel- and by pevlomai pélomai (H). This verb, meaning “to become, be” is supposed to be an “Aeolicism” in which
*kwe irregularly turned to pe instead of the common te. As it was attested in Homer in the third person of the middle, an equally plausible derivation would be from the medio passive of the Canaanite verb pŒl “to make, do,” used frequently in reference to deities. Thus pelei or peletai would be “it was done or made” rather than “it became.”156
No one doubts the existence of the root *kwel and of its presence in such Greek words as pólos “axle.” Chantraine, however, questions whether tel- belongs to this root. An additional problem is that the Mycenaean title te-re-ta, which would appear to be connected to tele “services due,” is not written with a q. It would be if it were derived from *kwel. Tello,many of the forms of which have a single l, has the same two meanings as télos “to achieve, complete, to rise up.” In fact, a widespread and common Egyptian root can provide a more plausible etymology for tel- and tell in the sense of “limit” and “complete.” It is dr, the basic meaning of which is “limit, end.” This form is frequently used concretely in space, as in dr “obstacle,” drˆ ”enclosing wall” and drw “boundary.” Dr and drw are, however, also used more abstractly in such phrases as r dr f literally “to its end” and meaning “entire, complete.” This function also matches derivatives of telos and tello\as well as their derivatives such as telete\“concerning initiation.” Nb r dr “lord to the end” was used of gods and kings both spatially and temporarily. Drˆ “strong, hard” is used in the sense of thorough “to press through to the end.” Dr is used verbally through time to mean “to end up as.” This sense closely resembles that of the Homeric televqw “to come into being, become, be.” The phonetic fit is tightened by the general Coptic rendition of r-dr as the prepronominal forms of te\r :_Old Coptic te\r _and
the Fayumic tel\ ._157
Dr as “distant limit” also provides a plausible etymology for th'le tel\e (H) “far, distant.” As can be seen above, the first vowel is also uncertain in Coptic. Two different and mutually exclusive hypotheses derive this Greek form from Indo-European: First, because of Boiotian rendering of th'le- in such names as Peivle- and in some Mycenaean personal
names beginning with q-, Chantraine accepted an original *kwel and



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 269
related it to the Sanskrit caramá “extreme.” Second, Szemerényi denied
the labiovelar root *kwel because of the long /e–/ in tel\e. He proposed a link to an Indo-European root *tål found in the Baltic tolì “distant.”158
6. ÷Mwr, MÅŒt Moi'ra, Meivromai AND MMÅŒT, Ma
The root ÷mwr is attested throughout Semitic. In Hebrew, it is “exchange, recompense, wealth.” In Amharic, märra is “to distribute or allot land.” South Arabic has mwr “frontier.” The Gunnan Gurage, or Outer South
Ethiopic, languages have mwärä “frontier, limit, brink of precipice.” Rounding of the /m/ in Asiatic Semitic languages is also indicated by the Latin murus, earlier moiros or moerus “boundary wall.” Ernout and Meillet see this word as a loan replacing the Indo-European *dheigh (t’eik’).159 Thus, it was probably borrowed from an unattested form in Punic. The Amharic märra and mErrit “distribution of land by the government” indicate another semantic aspect of the cluster also found in
the Gunnan Gurage mwar “individual part, share.” The form ÷mwr was not restricted to Semitic; Beja has mar “side.” The Highland East Cushitic language Haddiya has mara’a “row,” and Central Chadic has *mar “right.” Orel and Stolbova link this last to the Egyptian mÅŒt.160 MÅŒt is the central concept in Ancient Egyptian civilization and its facets have been treated at length by many Egyptologists.161 Translations include “righteousness, world order, justice and fair share.” A Babylonian transcription of Nb MÅŒ RŒ, the prenomen of Amenhotep III, read Nibmuaria. Thus, even after /Å/ had lost its consonantal quality the initial m- in mÅŒ was still rounded. Previously, it would have been
*mwarŒa(t).162 Given the Greek rendering of rounded consonants by CoiC (referred to in Chapter 5), this would provide an exact phonetic correspondence with Greek Moira (H).163 Like mÅŒt in Egyptian culture, moîra was central to Greek religion and thought and had a vast semantic range. The early twentieth-century British classicist J. B. Bury described its span in this way:
If we were to name any single idea as generally controlling or pervading Greek thought from Homer to the Stoics, it would perhaps be Moira, for which we have no equivalent. The common rendering “fate” is misleading. Moira meant a fixed order in the universe. . . . It was this order which kept things in their proper



270 BLACK ATHENA
places, assigned to each its proper sphere and function, and drew a definite line for instance between men and gods.164
This is an excellent description of mÅŒt!165 The tight phonetic and semantic fit is not seriously disturbed by the fact that moîra belongs to a cluster that the lexicographers put under the heading of meivromai, meíromai (H). The vocalization is easily derived from *moiromai. In fact, forms with /o/ or /oi/ are much more common in Greek than those with /ei/. Ethiopic Semitic has a frequent inter
change between Cwä and Co. The semantic range of the cluster is exactly that of the Afroasiatic ÷mwr “divide, portion, alot, destiny.” There are even specific correspondences, such as moi'ra (5) in the sense of “parcel of land” or mevro" (6) “part, lot, inheritance.”166 The lexicographers have difficulty in finding Indo-European cognates. A probable parallel with the Latin mereo\“to receive, portion or prize” would seem more likely to be a borrowing from Afroasiatic, like the Hittite mar-k- “to divide a sacrificial victim.” The problem remains to identify from which Afroasiatic language the word came. The probability that moîra itself came from the Egyptian mÅŒt is supported not only by the exactness of the phonetic and semantic fit but also by the two mÅŒty, the dual or doubled form of mÅŒt. These two played key roles in the weighing of the dead souls and were sometimes represented as the scales themselves. These functions are strikingly close to those of the Greek Moirai. It should be remembered that there were not always three Moirai; at Delphi there were only two.167 The other members of the cluster, as well as the Latin mereo\, are equally or more likely to derive from Semitic. As such, they could have been borrowed at any time in the Second or First Millennia. By contrast, the
transmission from mÅŒt or *mwara(t) to moîra must have taken place before the middle of the Second Millennium when /Å/ lost its consonantal quality. Other loans appear to have been made after that time. Pronounced as *ma, mÅŒ(t) appears to have been borrowed again into Greek as ma, a particle used in asseverations and oaths. With the preposition m as in m mÅŒ(t) “in truth” was also used, although not in the same syntactical position, as a marker of oaths—which were used in Egyptian law courts.168
MÅŒ ∆rw and Mavkar. Two compounds containing mÅŒ without consonantal /Å/ have had a major effect on Greek. The first of these *dˆt



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 271
mÅŒ “to render true, justify,” which appears in Greek in the bundle of
words around tême\v“honor, reward,” was discussed in Chapter 9.169 At this point, I shall consider the derivation of the Greek makar (H) from mÅŒ hr°w “true of voice.” MÅŒ hr°w was the title shouted by the audience to Horus when he defeated Seth in his case brought against him. The title was applied to the virtuous dead who have stood their trial in judgment. The Greek mákar, makária is usually translated “blessed, happy.” Already, in Hesiod hoi mákares were “the blessed dead,” and the makavrwn nhvswn
makáro\n ne\svo\n were the “Isles of the Dead”—the Egyptian dead also lived in the west. In Homer the adjective mákar- was generally applied to gods and immortals rather than to mortal men or women. In the fifth century CE makarites meant one recently dead just as makavrio", makários does in demotic Greek today. In Greek hagiology St. Makarios is involved in the judgment of souls. A. H. Krappe, E. Vermeule, C. Daniel and B. Hemmerdinger all accepted the derivation as semantically and phonetically convincing.170 Both Frisk and Chantraine reject the proposal without stating any reason for their objections or providing any alternative. Richard Pierce attacked the etymology for its “fundamental arbitrariness” and objected that a Greek transcription of mÅŒ hr°w as -mavcoro -mákhoro invalidated it as the origin of makários. R. Drew Griffith points out the extreme weakness of this case, especially given the context of the general parallels between the Egyptian and the Greek ways of death.171 Chapter 8 referred to the frequent alternations of /k/ and /kh/.172 The different vocalizations can be explained by renderings before and after the a–> o–shift.173
7. H°pr
H°pr is “to come into existence, become,” the opposite of the rarely used wnn “long lasting or permanent existence.” As some of the main Greek derivatives of h°pr are names of gods, they will be discussed in Chapter 19. Here, we shall look at verbal borrowing, from h°pr to the indeclinable Greek word u{par.
O[nar and U{par. In Book 19 (547) of the Odyssey, a voice in her dream assures Penelope that the previous dream within the dream was not a “dream” onar but a faithful hypar a “true vision” that will certainly be fulfilled.174 Later writers, from Pindar to Plato, followed Homer’s statement to make a distinction between the false onar and the true and divine hypar, which could be relied upon.



272 BLACK ATHENA
In the third century BCE the Alexandrian critic Zenodotos of Ephesos tried to establish a canonical text from all the disparate versions of the Homeric epics in circulation and accepted this traditional distinction. Zenodotos, however, was forced to confront the fact that some lines in the Iliad described onar and its assimilated form oneiros as having divine origins. In Book 2 (6), Zeus sent an “evil dream” ou[lon o[neiron to deceive Agamemnon. The oulon indicates a need to qualify the oneiron sent by the god. Even more difficult was the well-known passage near the beginning of the Iliad in which Achilles suggested, in Book 1 (62–63), “let us seek a seer or a priest [63] or a reader of dreams [oneiropolon], for a dream [onar] comes from Zeus.” Zenodotos’ solution was to “athetize” line 1:63 or declare it spurious. Modern critics have explained Zenodotos’ action as the result of the line’s containing the compound conjunction kai gar t(e), which occurs elsewhere in Homer only in “two notoriously late passages.”175 Thus, one emmendation has led to others. It seems to me much more likely that Zenodotos’ objection was to the content of the line rather than its form. An indication that this was the case comes from his removal of ten lines of text (2:60–70) which include Agamemnon’s report that the figure of Nestor in the dream (onar) sent to delude him declared, “I am a messenger to you from Zeus.” This line and its earlier occurrence in the original description of the dream (2:26, 34) was also rejected by Aristarkhos, Zenodotos’ fifth successor as tutor to the Ptolemaic dynasty and chief librarian. In the Iliad (2:56) and another part of the Odyssey (14:495) this dream is described with the same line that refers to an oneiros that was theios “divine.” These lines were also cut out by Zenodotos and declared to be spurious by Aristarkhos.176 The most plausible explanation for these contortions is that ancient and modern commentators have suffered from misplaced precision and have wanted to impose the clear-cut distinction between true divine hypar and false onar made in Odyssey 19:547 upon the whole of both epics. In this respect at least, I believe that it is simpler to respect the integrity of the texts and accept that in Homer, onar could be seen as coming from the gods but they were sometimes deliberately deceptive. As mentioned in Chapter 7, claims for an Indo-European etymology for onar/oneiros are made on the basis of an Armenian form anurj “dream.”177 Attestations in these two languages can be enough to establish an Indo-European root if the two forms fit the normal sound shifts found in these two branches of the linguistic family and, therefore, can



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 273
not be copies from one language to the other. In some cases, however, as in oneiros/anurj no consonantal shifts exist to guide us, so both possibilities are open. Accepting that the two words are related, one has to weigh the probabilities between an Indo-European genetic development, on the one hand, and a foreign copying into Greek and then on to Armenian, on the other. The latter copying is very possible as Armenian is only first attested in the fifth century CE in Christian texts translated from the Greek. Other possible Indo-European cognates for onar are the Albanian words for “dream” ädërë and ëndërrë. As Chantraine writes, however, this connection is “less clear.” Another reason for preferring the hypothesis of a copying from Egyptian into Greek is that onar was indeclinable—as was its antithesis hypar (for which see below). Like some other admitted loans, such as the names of the alphabetic letters alpha, beta, gamma etc., onar did not fit into the declension patterns found in all clearly native words. The most plausible origin for onar is from the Middle Egyptian wn h≥r “open the sight of, clear vision.”178 In Demotic it means “reveal.” The Coptic ouwnh was also used as a noun “revelation.”179 Vycichl reconstructs the Middle Egyptian pronunciation as *wan- ̇áÅ. This is very close, although there is a slight phonetic problem in deriving onar from wn h≥r; in that the shift from a semiconsonant or glide with a vowel *wa- to the purely vocalic *ou or *o is sometimes considered to have occurred after the dropping of final -rs.180 The dates of each of these changes are very uncertain. In any event, a well-known example the semiconsonant becoming vocalized while the final -r was retained is in the Greek transcription of the Egyptian divine name Wsir as “Osiris.” In this case the final was retained because of the archaism in a divine name. In the case of onar the final -r continued to be written and wn h≥r, too, was a religious or priestly word. All in all, the phonetic problems seem relatively slight. The semantic case is even stronger. I have argued above that, in Homeric times, whether true or false, an onar was believed to be a vision sent from the “real” world of the gods. It is possible that the Egyptian word was influenced by a close homonym to wn “open,” wn(n) “to be” in an eternal or unchanging sense. All in all, two reasons exist for preferring the explanation that onar is a loan from Egyptian: First is the weakness of the Indo-European etymology and the fact that, unlike the hypothetical Indo-European root, the Egyptian one is made up of intelligible units—wn “open” h≥r “face, sight.” Second, Greek has another word, oneiros, that is declined. This last fact in itself indicates that onar is a loan, as it is



274 BLACK ATHENA
generally recognized that the existence of similar though distinct words in the same semantic range is a sign of different borrowings from the same or a changing foreign form. One could deduce this, for example, from the English words candle, chandler, chandelier and candelabra. To return to the passage in Book 19 (547) of the Odyssey and the etymology of the rare word hypar: Some scholars have derived it from the preposition hypo “under.” The semantic and phonetic implausibility of this suggestion led Frisk to argue that it should be associated with the Indo-Hittite root found in the Greek hypnos and the Hittite suppar-iya “sleep.” The latter like the Latin sopor even has a final -r. Pierre Chantraine, who surveyed the previous discussion, is concerned with the semantic distance between “sleep” and “true dream.” He is not convinced by Frisk’s demonstration of analogous terms found in other Indo-European languages and used in both senses.181 In this case, neither Frisk nor Chantraine consider the possibility of a loan. Nor do they mention the problem posed by the fact that hypar, like onar, was indeclinable. There is, in fact, a very plausible source for the Homeric term in the fundamental Egyptian term h°pr “to take place, come to be, come into existence, become.” The semantic correspondence is exact. It would explain the distinction between the inevitable hypar and the divine, but possibly deceptive, onar. The phonetic fit is good but not perfect. The initial Egyptian /h°/ becoming the Greek /h/ might seem to present a problem. The most probable explanation is that the loan took place through Phoenician. /H°/ merged into /h≥/in Canaanite around the middle of the Second Millennium BCE.182 The Phoenician shifts /o/ >/u/ and /u/>/ü/, discussed in Chapter 5, can explain the first vowel in hypar.183
Dreams and their interpretation clearly played a central role in Egyptian culture especially in religion and medicine. The most frequent word for “dream” in Egyptian is rswt, rasou in Coptic, which comes from a root ris “to be awake.” At times rswt is used in the sense of “fleeting illusion.” A dream was also seen as a moment of contact between the world of the living and that of the dead and the gods. In dreams gods show themselves to mortals to convey their divine wishes, indicate a remedy or make a prediction.184 This is indicated by another Egyptian term for dream wpt mÅŒt “open to maat, truth or morality,” which is very close in sense to wn h≥r. In Egyptian culture, dreams were not always valued positively and bad or false dreams could be wished on others through magic. Dreams do not occur frequently in the Bible but when they do they



[CH. 10] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 1 275
are clearly seen as revelations or predictions.185 Even less is known about the interpretation of dreams in Phoenicia. There is no reason to suppose, however, that they were very different from those in Egypt. All in all, while there is every reason to suppose that a respect for the veracity of dreams and their function as revelations of the divine was native to Greek culture, there is also no doubt, given the heavy influence of Egyptian religion on that of Greece, that the terms onar “dream, revelation of reality” and hypar “what will happen” both appear to have originated in Egypt.
CONCLUSION
The derivations of hypar from h°pr, moîra and ma from mÅŒ t and tême\vand makários from *dit mÅŒ and mÅŒhr°w are overwhelmingly likely. So too is the derivation of mythos from m(w)dw. The proposed Egyptian etymology for tel\e is merely competitive, but those of télos and téllo\and their many derivatives are far superior to the proposed Indo-European etymologies. Each of the earlier sections also contains stronger and weaker Egyptian etymologies: xanthos, kántharos and kátharós and brenthos are obviously stronger than Kynthos, Kentauros or penthos. Similarly, sophía is much the most likely of the derivatives from sbÅ. Even the weaker ones, however, are plausible in the absence of challengers from Indo-European. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that each Egyptian and Semitic loan or copy that is accepted makes the next proposal more likely.

MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK
Part 2
CHAPTER 11
T
his chapter is concerned with just two Egyptian terms: First, nfr(w) “good, beautiful” with the additional meanings of “zero, base line.” Second, ms (i) “child, giving birth.” Both are central to Egyptian culture and had major and intertwined ramifications in Greece. These ramifications require considerable detailed attention.
NFR(W)/MS
Nfrw
The two Egyptian terms are linked in this section because of the intertwining of nymphs and Muses in Greek mytholology. Before considering these together, however. I shall turn to nfr and the Greek nephroí “kidneys.” Pokorny, supported by Ernout and Meillet, attempted to link this form to a stem *negu6h-rós “kidneys, testes” found elsewhere in the Germanic nior “kidney.” Chantraine, not happy with what he saw as a
hypothetical *neghw injected a note of caution pointing out that IndoEuropean contains many different roots for these organs. The only words that are clearly related to nephroí, are the Latin nefrendes and nefron–es and nebrundines, words from the dialects of Praeneste and Lanuvium. All of these mean “kidneys” and possibly “testes,” Nefrendes has another meaning, that of “suckling pig.” This suggests a larger



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 277
semantic field of “tender morsel.” Ernout and Meillet pointed out that these words look foreign and indeed a loan from nephroí would seem quite plausible. According to Horapollo’s description of hieroglyphics, written in the late fifth century CE the sign for “good” was written with a “heart and a windpipe.”1 His judgment has been accepted by modern Egyptologists
who explain the ideogram or triliteral sign nfr Y (F35) in this way. It is impossible to say whether the relationship between the sign and the word was real or merely punning. This still does not link nfr “good, beautiful,” to nephroí “kidneys.” The totally different Egyptian name for these organs is ggt. The connection comes from specialized meanings of nfr “zero” and nfrw “ground level, base line,” demonstrated by the historian of mathematics Beatrice Lumpkin.2 In a fascinating note, the Egyptologist Rosalind Park examined the problem of why during mummification only the heart and the kidneys were kept in the body after the other organs had been removed. She demonstrated that the kidneys were identified with the constellation Libra “the scales.”3 They were seen as the wise and balanced counsellors of the monarch, the heart. She illustrates their position on the Old Kingdom artistic grid system in which the base of the scales is on the midpoint of the canonical drawing of man, hence on the nfrw of the grid.4 Thus nfrw signified both kidneys and perfect harmony. I referred to nfr(w)t “beautiful young women” in Chapter 9.5 As a cattle-herding people, however, the earliest Egyptians saw real beauty in cows. Hathor the goddess of beauty was represented as a cow, and the epithet bow`pi" “cow-faced, cow-eyed” was applied to many Greek goddesses and beautiful women. Thus, it is not surprising to find a term nfrt for cattle. In Chapter 3, I noted that paintings in the Sahara represent bicolored cattle, indicating deliberate breeding; admiration for dappled cattle continued throughout Ancient Egyptian culture.6 In Greek the dappled fawnskins worn by initiates of the rites of Dionysos were called nebroiv (H). Chantraine confidently sees the Armenian nerk “color” as cognate. Given the association with dappled skins and Egyptian influence on Dionysiac cults, this etymology is far less precise semantically than that from nfr. Frisk pushes absurdity still further by proposing to link it to the Latin niger “black.”7



278 BLACK ATHENA
Moses and Moschos
In detailed artistic representations, the biliteral hieroglyph ms T (F31) is
of foxtails tied together. Information from the Sahara and Berber iconography strongly indicates a more fundamental meaning: that of water dividing and pouring into different channels necessary to fertilize the fields.8 Such imagery is appropriate for the breaking of the waters at
birth see msˆ TS® (F31, S29, B3) “childbirth.” The vocalizations of the
cluster of Egyptian words concerned with birth, written ms, are varied and complicated. To give birth was mise or misi in Coptic. In names denoting “son, child of ” the vowel was rendered /a–/ in Middle Babylonian and /a/ by Herodotos but /o–/by Manetho.9 In this case, however, there was probably a rounded mwa. In many Gurage languages mwäs(s)a meant “calf, young.” In Central Chadic the cognate of the Egyptian verb ms “give birth” is mwas.10 Despite the fact that *ms never appears alone in Egyptian names, it is generally acknowledged that the Hebrew name Moßeh derived from the Egyptian ms. The regular Hebrew correspondent of the Egyptian /s/ is /s=/. The Greek movsco" (H) has the general meaning of “young” and the specific meaning “sprout, shoot.” Frisk and Chantraine see this as Indo-European, citing the Armenian form mozi “calf ” to construct a root *mozg§ho-s. It would seem to me that mozi is more likely to be a loan from Semitic and that móskhos derives from a Phoenician form *mos=eh, corresponding to the Egyptian ms “calf, young animal,” the Coptic mase (S) masi (B).11
NFR/MS
Muses, genii, nymphs and Muses again
MUSES AS DAUGHTERS. At this point I should like to consider together the Greek reflections of the two Egyptian roots nfr and ms. I shall try to show that the Greek Mousai or Moisai like Moss±eh all derived their name from the Egyptian root ms. The search, however, will take us far beyond linguistics into an iconographical, mythological and literary investigation of the origin of nymphs and young spirits of childbirth and providers of nourishment. The Indo-European etymologies suggested for the name Muse are derived from a hypothetical *Mont-ya. This could mean “nymph of the mountain” (mons montis). It is true that the Muses or Musai were often



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 279
associated with mountains but mons is a Latin and not a Greek word, which makes the semantic case as weak as the phonetic.12 Another possibility is that *Mont-ya was connected to the Indo-European root *men “mind.” As the Muses were patrons of the arts and their mother was called Mnemosyne “memory,” this would be possible semantically, but there are phonetic problems in that men is a long way from Mousai. I shall argue below on iconographical grounds that the borrowing of Mousai goes back to the Middle Kingdom. Thus, the simplest etymol
ogy for Mousai is from an Egyptian *mwes. This would explain the Aeolic form Moi'sa, the Dorian Moisa–gevta “leader of the muses” (Apollo), and the Septuagint Mwush'", Moses. Semantically, the case for deriving Musai or Moisai from ms is almost equally good. The early poets laid great stress on the Muses being daughters or children of Zeus. The final lines of Hesiod’s Theogony read
Now sing of women, Muses you sweet-voiced Olympian daughters of the aegis-bearing Zeus.
Similar references to the Muses as daughters of Zeus are repeated in the second book of the Iliad, which contains some of the most ancient material in the epics.13
PREGNANT HIPPOPOTAMI. A further and deeper reason why they were
called Musai may be because of a connection not merely with ms T,∞
(F31, A17) “child” but also with msi “jchildbirth.” While the Muses were not simply Egyptian goddesses transported to Greece, we shall see that they did have precedents in Egyptian cults surrounding childbirth. As early as the Pyramid Texts inscribed in the Fifth Dynasty, but containing passages that date back to the Fourth Millennium, there is a reference to a goddess >Ipy, who is called on by the dead pharaoh to suckle him with her divine milk: “O my mother >Ipy, give me this breast of yours, that I may apply it to my mouth and suck this your white gleaming sweet milk. As for yonder land in which I walk, I will neither thirst nor hunger in it for ever.”14 No representations of >Ipy exist from this time. This is not surprising as the name seems connected with a root ipj or ipjÅ meaning “secret or private space” and ipjt “harem”—childbirth took place in retreats or restricted rooms. It is very likely, however, that even by this early period >Ipy was seen as a standing hippopotamus, as such a creature already appears on amulets and scarabs of the late Old Kingdom and First Intermediate period.



280 BLACK ATHENA
Scholars have speculated as to why the hippopotamus should have symbolized childbirth. One idea is that the animals were thought to give birth painlessly and to protect their young with great ferocity. This fierceness and the animals’ well-known bad temper might have made it necessary to appease the most dangerous spirit, rather as the jackal god Anubis was seen as protector of the dead.15 Another factor may simply have been a perceived physical resemblance between hippopotami and pregnant women. By the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, it is clear that >Ipy or the feminized form of her name >Ipt, “wet nurse, midwife,” was represented in this way. Another goddess Rrt had the body of a standing hippopotamus with lion’s limbs and a crocodile head. She, like >Ipt, was seen a protector of women in childbirth. Rrt also had astronomical functions and was associated with Nwt, the goddess of the sky and mother of the gods. Rrt as a standing hippopotamus with a crocodile on her back was seen as a northern constellation, the controller of the Great Bear.16 Some male deities also had a similar appearance. These, like the females, were associated with purification by water, especially purification of the dead. Such processes, like the divine inauguration of pharaohs, were seen as parallel to childbirth. Amulets in the form of beads with approximations of the design of the standing hippopotamus are found exclusively in the graves of women and children, presumably in connection with death in childbirth as well as rebirth into immortality. The design, however, was used on other objects during the Middle Kingdom, notably boomerang-shaped magic knives or wands. On these, etchings of standing hippopotami holding large knives were strongly represented among other gods and demons. Thus, the hippopotamus divinities were not only the goddess herself but also her smaller demons or helpers.17 It is clear from tomb paintings that these wands were used at childbirth and also for the resurrection of the dead. Many of the standing hippopotami show what is called a “dorsal appendage,” that is to say a long striped worm-like object. By the Twelfth Dynasty, crocodiles replaced the worms or were added to them. The image of a hippopotamus with a crocodile on her back brought together the two most powerful and dangerous forces of the river. Later in the Middle Kingdom, the figures developed more characteristics of the lion, and by this time the hippopotamus-lion-crocodile figure had begun to be known—presumably because of the great fear she inspired—as the TÅ Wrt, “the Great One” or Thueris to the Greeks.18



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 281
GOD OF BIRTH. In the Middle Kingdom Thueris was frequently placed together with a companion the god Be–s, a mysterious divinity of music and rebirth, who was portrayed as a negroid dwarf or pygmy but also had leonine features. He was known as “the Lord of Punt” or “Master of Nubia” and, therefore, was associated with central Africa.19 The mythographer Mircea Eliade maintained that a close relationship linked initiatory circumcision and death. He saw the former in “Africa” as having been carried out by men dressed as lions or leopards.20 Eliade’s “Africa” is ill-defined, although it must be restricted to those largely Afroasiatic-speaking societies in which circumcision is practiced. The anthropologists Maria Stracmans and Anna Montes point out that the practice continues in a number of African cultures where the initiates are stripped and painted white, the color of corpses, and humiliated with jokes and ribaldry.21 Even though the surviving Ancient Egyptian illustrations of circumcision are much more prosaic, the Egyptian rituals, jokes, ribaldry, and initiation were central to the character and cult of Be–s.
The/s/ with which Be–s’ name is usually written, S, was etymologi
cally a voiceless dental fricative /s/. By contrast, the hieroglyph s was
originally a voiced /z/. The two phonemes merged as /s/ in the Middle Kingdom. As the name Be–s is only attested from the late New Kingdom its earlier pronunciation is uncertain. Takács writes about this: “etymology risky due to the unknown OEg sibilant.” Taking it as the unvoiced sibilant, he prefers as an etymology the tenuously attested parallel word bs “orphan, foundling.” The semantic connection with Be–s requires some convolutions. If, on the other hand, one posits that the early form was *bz there are many fruitful links with other Afroasiatic roots. Before discussing these, it is necessary to consider other words attested in Middle Egyptian that are written bs with uncertainty as to which s (s>s or z>s) to use. Bsˆ was “to flow or spring forth” (of water) and medically “to swell, bodily discharge.” BsÅ was “to protect,” and in the phrase mw bsÅ “water of protection” it was mother’s milk.22 All these have strong connotations of physical birth. By itself, however, bs meant “to introduce someone into, install as king, initiate, reveal a secret to.” It also meant “secret” itself.23 Furthermore, these may also explain the origin of the first element of the cry made at the moment of initiation at Eleusis, pavx kogx. pax kongx.24 This extensive cluster fits with Be–s’ cultic role as the personification of birth, rebirth, protection and initiation. Be–s was most popular in the



282 BLACK ATHENA
Late Period but the linkage of his cult with that of Thueris goes back to the Middle Kingdom.25 Accepting the original consonantal structure of the name as *Bz, we are left with the problem of vocalization. Ehret sees a cognate for bz “reveal” in a Proto-Cushitic form *beez.26 However, following regular sound shifts the Late Egyptian Be–s would have been *Bu–z in earlier Egyp
tian. Interestingly, this path brings us close to Bwäz=z=ä, the lightning god of the pagan Gurage, and the Cushite deity Bazo–. The phonological parallels are matched geographically, Be–s allegedly came from Nubia
and Punt, the general region in which Bwäz=z=ä/Bazo–has been worshipped. Nevertheless, the natures of the two divinities are very different. As far
as I am aware, Bwäz=z=ä/Bazo– seems unlike Be–s and is far closer to the Egyptian Min, as a god of thunder and phallic fertility.27 He has no concern with human birth, initiation and death, or lions. In this connection and in light of the leonine circumcisers referred to above, it is interesting to find a phonetic *bz representing the head or neck (or mask?) of a lion or equid. This parallels lion masks used in modern African circumcision rituals.28 For this Takács finds Agau cognates of bE@dΩWE “leopard, panther” and abza “lion.”29 He provides examples of Cushitic, Semitic, Berber and, possibly, Omotic cognates of *bz as “reveal.” Takács plausibly sees *bz “secret” as possibly coming from the same root, although it may be related to Chadic forms *b-z “envelope.”30 In short, Be–s was the god of birth and initiation and the secret ceremonies surrounding them.
THE CRETAN “GENII.” In the Aegean, the terms “genius” and “daemon” have described frequent representations of a type of fantastic creature that has been seen to combine features of wasps, lions, pigs or donkeys. By 1890, scholars had suggested a derivation from Thueris, and within a few decades Arthur Evans was able to demonstrate a clear iconographic trail that led from First Intermediate period or early Middle Kingdom Egyptian representations of TÅ Wrt/Thueris as a hippopotamus with crocodile skin on her back to the many “genii” from the Bronze Age Aegean.31 In the last few decades, some have tried to deny this derivation but these attempts have been thoroughly refuted. Now no doubt exists about the iconographic or pictorial connection.32 When did the figures first arrive in Crete? The earliest example is on a scarab found in a tholos tomb at Platanos in the south of the island. Scholars differ as to whether the scarab is Egyptian or a Cretan imitation.



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 283
If it is Egyptian, the question is whether it comes from the First Intermediate period or the Twelfth Dynasty. The date of the tomb in which it was found is also controversial; it ranges from Early Minoan III to Middle Minoan III.33 This particular scarab was probably not the first to arrive on the island. Nevertheless, as with the bull cult, Thueris probably arrived in Crete just before the establishment of the palaces as part of the cultural package from southwest Asia and Egypt that transformed the social and political life of the island. This transformation came in the Eleventh Dynasty, precisely between the two periods proposed for the “first” scarab. In any event, the Platanos scarab and the imprints of seals in the palaces at Phaistos and Knossos clearly show that the figures were current and widespread in Crete during the Old Palace period. It is equally evident that the motif spread from Crete to Cyprus and mainland Greece in the Late Bronze Age. Today, conventional wisdom accepts the iconographic derivation but there is much more skepticism about any relationship between the meaning and function of Thueris and the Aegean genii. The art historian Margaret Gill utterly denies any link. Walter Burkert is more judicious but gives the same impression, “Iconographically they are to be linked to the Egyptian Hippopotamus Goddess Ta-Urt, the Great One, who wears a crocodile skin on her back, but neither the multiplication of their figures nor their servile function can be derived from the Egyptian.”34 As mentioned above, both the multiplication and the servility are evident from the early Middle Kingdom.
ACKNOWLEDGED FUNCTIONAL PARALLELS BETWEEN THUERIS AND “GENII.”
Conventional views on the “genii” and their relationship to Egypt are set out well by the isolationist art historians Roland Hampe and Erika Simon. As they see it, the “genius” is
A creature . . . [that] belongs partly to the animal kingdom, partly to that of humans and gods. . . . it appears in isolation or with its fellows, in the service of a deity, brought under control by one, or else taming or killing of wild animals; it can even be an object of cult. This creature has correctly been described as a demon, since it corresponds to a surprising degree to a the Platonic definition of Demonic as something intermediate between gods and men. . . . It is certain that the Mycenaeans took the idea from Crete and the



284 BLACK ATHENA
Minoans were led to their representation of it by the Egyptian hippopotamus goddess Ta-urt, who walks on her hind legs. . . . The white colour of the demons . . . indicates that they are female . . . it need cause no surprise because iconographically they are derived from an Egyptian goddess.35
Here, then, is a concession that gender, one of the Egyptian deity’s most salient characteristics, had been transmitted. The latest work on the subject suggests that other characteristics also spread. One instance sometimes given as a purely Aegean development is that the genii were associated with ewers and pouring water. Plausibly, this development has been described as the result of a cultic adaptation to a rainfall climate. The archaeologist of Crete, Judith Weingarten, has shown, however, that in the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom—as is entirely appropriate for a hippopotamus—Thueris was associated with the waters of heaven: “that is, the waters of Nun, primeval ocean. The hippopotamus demon comes to personify the watery chaos from which the world was formed and these waters are transformed into the waters of lustration and purification.” Weingarten also points out that in the Middle Kingdom, women were ritually cleansed fourteen days after birth. She sees Thueris as a divine nurse associated with this procedure. It seems to me that Thueris, as the primeval waters, represented not only the waters that cleansed women after childbirth but also the waters and blood of childbirth itself. Nevertheless, Weingarten rightly focuses on the purification.36 From the early New Kingdom, hollow statuettes of Thueris were made with breasts perforated to let liquids escape drop by drop. These were used to sprinkle lustral water or milk. Basins of purification are also dedicated to Thueris. Weingarten points out that Thueris presided over rites in which pure water was poured over a kneeling priest into a basin. Although these rites are only attested in the New Kingdom, she maintains that passages from the Coffin Texts indicate that such rituals and basins can be traced back to the Middle Kingdom.37 Another characteristic of the Aegean genii is hunting. Here too Egyptian precedents seem to exist. In Middle Kingdom representations Thueris carries a large knife and attacks and slays the enemies of Horus and Ra. Weingarten writes about this: “[Thueris’] carrying animal victims to sacrifice may be a Minoan extension of her devouring or decapitating the enemies of Re. This does not deny her female gender, but signals a func



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 285
tional ambivalence in her very nature, an ambivalence already clearly attested in Middle Kingdom Tawaret [Thueris].”38
DEMONS. The term “demon,” also used for these figures, is unnecessarily imprecise. Linguists like Pokorny and classicists like E. R. Dodds have claimed that the word daivmwn (H) came from the root daiovmai “divide, apportion.” Hence, it was the “divider” or “master.”39 Martin Nilsson however, believed that the daimo\n was originally not only intermediate but also impersonal “a mere manifestation of power.”40 Such an interpretation suggests the Canaanite root dmh “resemble” and the attested form dimyôn “divine manifestation.”41 This, of course, is the central meaning of the Egyptian kÅ. According to Plato, a daimo\n was a special being obtained by a person at birth that continues to watch over him or her.42 Walter Burkert points out that Plato’s view came from an earlier tradition.43 Given this origin, it is not surprising that the Greek concept of the demon was very vague. Demons were certainly not only females. Thus, the term would not seem suitable for the genii. I believe that one can be rather more precise about the genii. The best way in which to approach this problem is to look at a particular representation of the genii on a large gold ring found at Tiryns near Mycenae dating from the sixteenth or fifteenth centuries BCE. On the seal, four genii carry ceremonial libation jugs to a seated divinity or monarch, who is holding a large vessel. Behind the throne is, as Hampe and Simon put it, a “heraldic creature—a hawk or a falcon.”44 This version has the typically Aegean adap
tation with a twisted or wry neck of the hieroglyph » (G7). This
hieroglyph is made up of } (G5) “falcon” or the god Horus and c (R12) “standard for carrying religious symbols.”45 In the Old Kingdom
» was a sign for Horus and it remained predominantly associated with that god. By the Middle Kingdom, however, when the symbol would have been introduced to the Aegean it was used more widely for any deity. So on the Tiryns ring the representation could merely signify “divinity” with a possible pointer to Apollo, who was the counterpart of Horus. Nevertheless, although there is some uncertainty about this, the figure on the Tiryns ring appears feminine and, so, could likely be Apollo’s twin sister Artemis. This identification is strengthened by the fact that in
the Old and Middle kingdoms » was used as an alternative for √ (R13) the determinative for ˆmn(t) “west.” Further arguments for this will be given in Chapter 19. At this point I merely note my conviction that,



286 BLACK ATHENA
while the name Apollo comes from H°prr—the scarab god of the rising sun—that of Artemis derives from the Egyptian, or Aegypto-Aegean, *H≥rt Tmt, the feminine form of H≥r Tm, the god of the evening sun.46 In any event, Artemis was the goddess of the evening sun and we know that her name dates back to the Bronze Age since A-te-mo appears on Linear B tablets. Thus, a sign for “the west” strongly suggests that the seated figure is Artemis. The Egyptian sign ˆmn, mentioned above, also suggests the Cretan city of Amnissos. This place-name appears to come from the Egyptian ˆmnt “west” and is attested in the fifteenth century BCE and possibly a thousand years earlier than that.47 Such an identification of the enthroned figure with the goddess of hunting would fit very well with the hunting activities carried out by genii on other seals and paintings. Thus, the female genii associated with watering and hunting could be the prototypes for Artemis’s nymphs.
NYMPHS, LILIES AND BEES. The derivation of the Greek nymphai from the Egyptian nÅ n(y) nfr(w)t “the beautiful young people/women,” was set out in Chapter 9.48 Crete had many traditions of pairs of nymphs sheltering and rearing the infant Zeus or Dionysos. These tales appear to parallel those of Isis and Nephthys who bury, mourn for and revive Osiris. Two of these nymphs were Ida and Adrasteiva. The latter name can be plausibly derived from Drt ndst “lesser kite,” a title of Nephthys. These two nymphs were supposed to have been the daughters of Melisseus “honeyman.”49 Thus, they were in some ways “bees” (seen as female in antiquity) or wild women who ranged the mountains while producing nourishment. The actual and metaphorical sweetness of human milk has been noted in many cultures, and we have seen above its use in the Pyramid Text about >Ipy. Honey placed on sores and wounds played an important role in Egyptian medicine.50 This practice suggests a connection between honey and immortality since Egyptian thought traced a parallel between recovery from sickness and rebirth after death. As a well-known poem from the Middle Kingdom text, “Dispute between a Man and his Ba,” puts it movingly:
Death is before me today (Like) a sick man’s recovery Like going outdoors after confinement.51



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 287
Both the Egyptian medicinal use of honey and the relation to immortality appear to be reflected in the Iliad. Near the end of that epic when Achilles is mourning the death of his beloved friend Patroklos and is afraid his flesh will rot, his mother Thetis reassured him and “on Patroclus she shed ambrosia and ruddy nectar, through his nostrils, that his flesh might be sound continually.”52 This mummification—in Egypt preservatives were introduced through the nose—relied on the two substances that provided sustenance to the gods. The word nevktar comes from the Semitic reflexive participle of the verb ÷qtr “fume, waft upwards as smoke or vapor.” The Greek néktar refers to perfumed or smoked wine, possibly even distilled, hence, “immortal” liquor.53 The Greek word “ambrosia” simply means “immortal.” In the Homeric epics the sacred substance was used to counter putrefaction of both living and dead flesh. In this it was used in the same way as honey in Egypt. In Greece it was seen first as food or fodder for the gods and their immortal animals and later as their drink. Modern scholars tend to see ambrosia as having been an idealized form of honey.54 In the Aegean, then, honey nourished infants and the dead and other newly inducted immortals. A specific Egyptian parallel to the Cretan honey-givers can be seen in an adoration of the sky goddess Nut who arches over the dead in their coffins and who, it will be remembered, was associated with the hippopotamus/crocodile goddess Reret. Nut’s Greek counterpart was Rhea, the mother of the gods, who sheltered and nourished her son Zeus on Crete. Other reports say that the young Zeus was fed by bees.55 A prayer to Nut in the Pyramid Texts reads, “Oh Nut you have appeared as a bee . . . Oh Nut cause the king [Nsw] to be restored so he may live.”56 There is a pun here in that, as mentioned earlier, bˆt meant not only “bee and honey” but also “king of Lower Egypt.”57
MORE CRETAN NYMPHS AND HONEY. Now let us return to bees and honey in Crete, which lies at the junction of Levantine, Egyptian and Aegean cultures. Another nymph who nourished the young Zeus was Ajmavlqeia
Amáltheia, whose name may well come from iHt* ˆmÅt “female ibex” with the divine suffix -theia.58 Amaltheia’s magic horn of plenty was sometimes filled with honey. Bronze Age evidence indicates that honey also figured in the cult of Eileithuia (Eileithyia), the Aegean goddess of childbirth, at Amnissos. A tablet from Knossos reads:



288 BLACK ATHENA
Amnissos: one jar of honey to Eleuthia [Eileithyia], One jar of honey to all the gods, One jar of honey. . . .59
Eileithyia, and the many variants of the name, would seem to come from the Semitic >E/iltu or * >Elat attested in Akkadian, Ugaritic and Phoenician; it simply means “goddess.” Thus, like TÅ Wrt (Thueris), Eileithyia would seem to be a cover name for a goddess of such power and menace that her real name would be too frightening to utter. Eileithyia frequently appears in the plural—Eileithyiai—and it is clear that, like Thueris, the Aegean goddess of childbirth had many female helpers. The association of Eileithyia with Amnissos, as indicated on the tablet, continued for more than a thousand years. The earliest reference to Amnissos is in an Iron Age text: in the Odyssey Amnissos is the site of a cave of Eileithuia.60 According to Kallimakhos’ Hymn to Artemis, Artemis was the divinity of childbirth.61 Kallimakhos was a high official at the great library at Alexandria and was known for his pedantic statement “nothing unattested do I sing.”62 In this case, his claim is confirmed by inscriptions found in many places where the cult of Artemis represented or had assimilated that of Eileithyia the goddess of childbirth.63 In another poem for the seventh-day celebration of the birth a little girl, Kallimakhos wrote:
Artemis (who dost haunt) the Cretan plain of Amnissos . . . wherefore accept gentle goddesses, this earnest request . . . Muse, I will sing for the little maid.64
These lines touch on many themes of this chapter. Artemis’s association with Amnissos is referred to again in Kallimakhos’ Hymn to Artemis:
Give me sixty daughters of Okeanos for my choir—all nine years old, all maidens yet ungirdled, give me for handmaidens, twenty nymphs of Amnissos . . . 65
Pausanias wrote, “The Cretans think that Eileithyia was Hera’s child born in Amnissos in the country round Knossos.”66 The connections among Eileithyia, Artemis and Amnissos are even more interesting in the light of the seal on the Tiryns ring discussed above. Let us now return to the offering of honey to Eileithyia at Amnissos. Greeks of the Dark and Archaic ages undoubtedly associated nymphs with bees and honey. Five small thin golden plaques, from late seventh



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 289
century BCE Rhodes show figures whose top halves are off-Egyptian nymphs and whose bottom halves are those of bees or wasps. The bottom portions matched by wings above the nymphs’ heads. From the same period similar wings hover above the Mistress of the Animals, generally associated with Artemis. She holds a lion by the tail in each of her hands. The pattern on her skirt suggests that she is both a woman and a half bee. Hampe and Simon write about the Rhodian “bee nymphs”:
The bee is rather to be placed among the entourage of mothergoddesses, such as Demeter and Rhea, and for that reason in Crete it was regarded as one of the nurses of the infant Zeus; this ancient Minoan myth must still have been alive in Crete in the seventh century, for bees are often used as decoration on Cretan vases. Finally, in the Greek oral tradition melissai [bees] was a general term for nymphs, whose characteristics as pure, nourishing and prophetic beings were equated with those of bees. . . . as far as the gold sheets are concerned it is best to speak of melissai. If these sheets were made primarily as ornaments for the dead—for which their thinness and lack of granulation might serve as argumentsthey might supply another element for Greek beliefs about bees; people were convinced that bees emerged from the bodies of the dead and therefore saw in these creatures symbols of immortality.67
The idea of bees swarming in carcasses comes in legends about Aristaios, the son of the nymph Kyrene, the eponym of the Libyan city. Aristaios supposedly invented bee culture and other forms of agriculture. He was seen as a son of Apollo and all the stories about him involve nymphs. According to Pindar and Virgil, Aristaios’ mother instructed him to sacrifice four young bulls, four heifers and, later, a calf and a ewe to propitiate the spirit of the musical hero Orpheus. On the ninth day after the first sacrifice, he returned to find a swarm of bees coming from the rotting carcasses. He put the bees in a hive and began apiculture or the domestication of bees.68 This story is, of course, similar to that of Sampson, who killed a young lion and came back days later to find bees swarming in the carcass.69 This part of the biblical story has been modified so drastically for narrative purposes that it is difficult to make mythological sense of it, although the elements are clearly significant. The legend of Aristaios, however, clearly links the emergence of bees to the recovery of Orpheus from Hades and, as Hampe and Simon suggest, to immortality. Given the



290 BLACK ATHENA
emphasis on childbirth and nursing seen above, I believe that one can go further and specify that the Melissai or bee-nymphs were symbols of rebirth. One of the most famous passages in Greek poetry on nymphs was written many centuries before the Rhodian ornaments were made. In the Odyssey Homer described the Cave of the Nymphs in Ithaca: “At the head of the harbour is a long-leafed olive tree, and near it is a pleasant shadowy [misty] cave sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads. Therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone and there too bees store honey.”70 Not only does this passage associate nymphs and bees, but it also has essential characteristics of nymphs that point straight back to the cult of Thueris in Egypt. Naiad means “pourer.” As we have seen above, this aspect of the cult of Thueris is also associated with stone jars and basins. The striking similarity between this cave and the scene depicted on the Tiryns ring will be discussed below.
BEE STINGS. The “gentle goddesses” in Kallimakhos’ poem seem to point to the genii. Bees, however, not only make honey; they also sting. This aspect too fits the divinities of childbirth. As Homer put it in the Iliad: “When the sharp dart striketh the woman in travail, the piercing dart that the Eileithyai, the goddesses of childbirth send even the daughters of Hera, that have in their keeping bitter pangs.”71 The term for travail or labor in this passage is a form of the word wjdiv–"/ wjdi'no" with the root o\dín- and o\dín “pain” usually of childbirth. The similar word ojduvnai ody!nai (H) had the more general meaning of “pains.” The English “anodyne” comes from this word. Then there is ojdu–vromai ody!romai (H) “to let out cries of pain, lament.” Frisk supposes ody!nai to come from the Indo-European root *ed “eat” in the sense “bite.” Chantraine is more attracted to the Armenian erkn “pain of childbirth” and proposes a root *ed-won or *ed-wen.72 The variation of words associated with the pains of childbirth suggests a loan rather than a derivation from PIE. Egyptian has a cluster of words written as wdn “to be heavy, become difficult” but also “to install as god or king, make offerings, especially libations.”73 Thus, this cluster signifies to give birth, either to life or to immortality. The idea of pouring over or flowing out of liquids suggests both vegetable and animal birth. In this case, the Greek words help us understand the semantic field of the Egyptian, illustrating, yet again, how difficult it is to understand any of the great civilizations of the Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean without taking the others into account.



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 291
ARTEMIS AND KYBELE. One of the seven great wonders of the world, proclaimed during the Hellenistic period, was the huge magnificent temple of Artemis at Ephesos. In antiquity, Ephesos—on the west coast of Anatolia south of Izmir—was a meeting point of the Greek and the local Lydian cultures. The temple for which the city became famous was dedicated both to Artemis and to the Anatolian goddess Kybele, who assimilated Artemis there. The two goddesses were not totally different in their original characteristics or in their origins; both show strong Semitic and Egyptian associations. Both were goddesses of hunting and wild places as well as of fertility. Both demanded human sacrifices and exercised power over men. Greek myths report men blinded for having seen Artemis and her nymphs bathe naked, while priests of Kybele castrated themselves in ecstasy and offered their bleeding genitals to the goddess. The priestesses of Artemis of Ephesos were known as Melissai. The earliest coins of Ephesos, struck in the late seventh century BCE, symbolized the city with a bee. Even the famous statues of the Ephesian Artemis, in which her body is covered with breasts, seem to be idealized representations of queen bees, whose bodies contain food for the whole colony. A bee itself is represented on the statues just above her feet.74 Not only the Ephesian Artemis was seen as a bee. The Boiotian poet Pindar in the sixth century BCE described Artemis as a bee for her chastity and cleanliness.75
WASPS AND SPHINXES, APOLLO AND ARTEMIS. Thin waists may only indi
cate a creature’s youthfulness but, while the lower halves of the genii resemble bees, they look even more like wasps, insects with the sting of bees but no honey. In this aspect of their representation, too, there may have been symbolic or religious significance. The Greek word for “wasp” is sfhvx/, sfhkov" (H). Possible Indo-European derivations for this word have been presented but remain uncertain. Whether or not there is a direct etymology, and I believe there may well be, the word closely resembles sfiv(n)x, sfi(n)ko" “sphinx.” In the classical period “sphinx” was related to sfivggw “squeeze, strangle” and the Egyptian monster was thought of as “the strangler.” As part lion, however, a sphinx would also be likely to chase and pounce with sharp claws. The Egyptian word for sphinx is s=spw, a general word for “statue, image” written with a sphinx determinative. Since the 1920s, it has been widely accepted that the Greek sphí(n)x-sphi(n)kós derives from
*s=spw Œnh°“living image.”76 Thus, sphe\xv, is more likely to come from sphí(n)x, than vice versa.



292 BLACK ATHENA
The Egyptian origins of their names and of many attributes of Apollo and Artemis will be discussed in Chapter 19 below, as will their associations with solar and leonine cults and the Great Sphinx. To the extent that they can be gendered, the early Egyptian sphinxes were male, in the late Second Millennium, however, sphinxes were increasingly represented as feminine all around the East Mediterranean.77 No doubt Artemis was associated with winged sphinxes; see, for instance, the winged sphinx found at her temple at Ephesos.78 She was frequently represented beside, or holding, lions or was seen as a lion itself. Her leonine qualities are clearly linked to both hunting and childbirth. In the Iliad, Homer has Hera revile Artemis, “it was against women that Zeus made thee a lion and granted thee to slay whomsoever of them thou wilt.”79 Like, or rather as, Eilethyia, Artemis was the killer of women in childbirth. This idea is not so surprising when one considers the goddess’s identification with wild animals. She was, of course, a hunter, but like Athena with whom she was often confused, she was probably related to the Mistress of the Animals depicted in Mesopotamian, Syrian and Aegean art.
A connection between sphe\xv, and the plural sphe\kves with sphínx- sphinkes suggests another link between wasps and sphinxes, which, in the light of Artemis association with the latter, would be appropriate for that aspect of the genii’s representation.
LIONS AND BEARS. The parallel between wasps and lions brings us to the mammalian features of the genii. These features may represent traces of the original hippopotamus of Thueris or those of the lion that was beginning to represent the Egyptian goddess and her helpers in the late Middle Kingdom. Lions were still present around the Aegean in the Second Millennium BCE, which might make them preferable to the exotic hippopotamus. Another northern animal was also involved. In Chapter 3, a conceptual equation was suggested between hippopotami and bears: the parallel between the Egyptian db “hippopotamus,” and the Canaanite dob “bear.”80 In addition, in at least late Egyptian cosmology, the hippopotamus with a crocodile on her back, the goddess Reret, was seen as the constellation known to the Greeks and to us as the Great Bear.81 Given this equation and the likelihood that bearlike, as well as leonine, features influenced the snouts or faces of the genii it is interesting to note that Greek legends connected Artemis and the nymphs to bears in the story of Kallistw.v Kallisto–, one of the nymphs, was seduced by



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 293
Zeus and turned into a bear. Artemis wanted to kill her but Zeus saved her baby Arkas who grew up to become the ancestor of the Arkadians. Kallisto–herself was snatched up and put in the sky as the constellation Arktos, the Great Bear.82 Thus, here is a specific parallel to Reret and Thueris. The nymphs’ role as bears also appeared in ritual. In Archaic and Classical times, at the beautiful bay of Brauron in eastern Attica, little girls between five and ten celebrated a cult of Artemis by dancing in her honor while dressed up as bears.83 Even more fascinating, the girls wore robes, over their normal garments, the color of which was krokwtov". The usual translation for this word is “saffron, yellow” as in crocus. Many scholars, however, have plausibly seen it as “tawny” to match a bear’s fur.84 It should be noted that the Greek word krokovdi–lo" “crocodile” comes from the same root; it could also mean “tawny.” The chromatic uncertainty is confirmed by the mixed color of the equivalent of the crocodile skin on the backs of the genii portrayed on a fragment of Mycenaean wall painting.85 The little girls at Brauron link the genii to the “gentle” Artemides and Eileithyiai as do the midwifery and stinging pains of childbirth. The water pouring, honey giving, and hunting all indicate that the nymphs of the Archaic and Classical periods derive from the Minoan and Mycenaean genii and that the latter originated from Thueris and her demons.
MUSES AGAIN. How do the Muses fit in this scheme? First, nymphs and Muses were not dissimilar. They formed groups of beautiful adolescent or young women who frequented mountains, springs, pools and other wild places. Both, for instance, had cults at Mount Helikon in Boiotia as well as in Arkadia.86 Both Muses and nymphs were associated with Apollo and Artemis. Thus, it is probably best to see the Muses as a subset of the nymphs. If this is the case, the genii could well have been prototypes of both nymphs and Muses. We know, for instance, that it was a commonplace that bees were seen as the “birds of the Muses.”87 The Homeric Hymn to Hermes, was probably written in the seventh century, when the plaque of nymph bees, mentioned earlier, was made. In the hymn, Apollo says to his brother Hermes:
There are certain holy ones—three virgins gifted with wings: their heads are besprinkled with white meal, and they dwell under a ridge of Parnassos. These are teachers of divination apart from



294 BLACK ATHENA
me, the art which I practiced while yet a boy following herds. . . . From their home they fly now here, now there, feeding on honeycomb and bringing all things to pass. And when they are inspired through eating yellow honey, they are willing to speak the truth, but if they be deprived of the gods’ sweet food then they speak falsely as they swarm in and out together.88
These bee-nymphs were called the Thryai but their arts of ecstatic prophecy makes them resemble both the three Fates and the Muses.
LEVANTINE INFLUENCES. Some interesting parallels for the Cretan genii and nymphs and Muses can be found in the Levant. Late Bronze Age myths from Ugarit, refer to the three nubile daughters of the god Ba’al. Called different names in different myths, they all appear to have connections to the earth, the dew and fertility. The most obvious of these is T≥ly whose name comes from the root *t≥al found throughout Afroasiatic. Orel and Stolbova see four roots with this structure and the meanings “give birth, young animal, dew drop, flow, pour.”89 The Ugaritic t≥ll and the Hebrew t≥al mean “night mist, dew” and there is the Hebrew t≥åleh “lamb, young of other kinds.” This provides a good etymology for Greek qavllw (H) “grow, be flourishing.” The only Indo-European parallel forms come from Albanian and Armenian. Michael Astour has convincingly derived the Greek traditions of the three daughters of Kekrops, the founder of Athens, and Hesiod’s three Graces from these Semitic myths.90 One of the Graces was called Qavleia and Tháleia was also the name of one of Hesiod’s Muses. Conventionally, there were nine Muses, but the specific number was inconsistent. Thus, I think it is worthwhile considering these Semitic myths in conjunction with the Greek traditions about nymphs and Muses and the Bronze Age representations of genii. The scene on the large ring from Tiryns, discussed above, is clearly concerned with vegetation. Branches or shoots of trees stand between the genii and are represented above the scene. But there are also hints that they might be blades of wheat or barley. The relation to the watering or “lustration” of Thueris and her helpers to that of the genii has been referred to earlier in this chapter and Greek Archaic images of Artemis indicate a relation with poured or flowing water. She was also known as Limnatis or Limnaia “the lady of the lake.”91 The Tiryns ring, however, indicates that the genii are watering veg



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 295
etation. A smaller seal shows this function more strongly. Two genii hold libation jugs above branches set in “horns of consecration.” In Ugaritic mythology Pgtv, the daughter or wife of the sage Dan>el, “carries the water that spreads the dew on the barley, knows the courses of the stars.”
Pgtv, in turn, has been identified with Pûœåh, a midwife who warned Moses of danger.92 Here we have a confirmation of the connection of the “nursery” to both the bringing to life and the nourishing of both plants and children. Hampe and Simon tentatively see the flecks that cover both the canopy above the scene and the dress of the goddess on the Tiryns ring as, “little ‘drops’ [that] might indicate the intention of the cult: to produce rain, always a matter of great concern in Mediterranean lands.”93 The idea is plausible, although the drops could also represent dew. In the center of the canopy above the scene is a circle with a star inside it. If this is read
as a Cretan version of the Egyptian hieroglyph K (N15), it would be the dwÅt “the Underworld, place of the morning twilight.” Either or both of these meanings would seem appropriate. The Ugaritic legends refer to the daughters of Ba‘al descending into the earth for the birth of a mysterious son of Ba‘al but they are also concerned with watering and the encouragement of vegetation. Twilight is, of course, the time of dew. The connection with t≥al or thal(l) “dew,” in fact, provides a clue as to the ceremony being represented. The word qallov" (H) means “young shoot, young branch”; qalov" (H) is used for “scion, young child.” Homer uses the title Qaluv–sia or a festival of Artemis—“of the golden throne,” of the “first fruits of the harvest in . . . rich orchard land.”94 The ring could represent this. On the other hand, the scene also resembles Homer’s Cave of the Nymphs.
CHILDBIRTH AND APOTHEOSIS. It is altogether appropriate that Artemis/ Eileithyia should be served by miniature versions of Thueris, because the watering and nourishing of plants was closely associated with aiding in human birth. It should be remembered, however, that the oldest reference to Thueris’ prototype >Ipy is in the Pyramid Texts. The dead pharaoh calls on her to suckle him with her divine milk, to make him be born again into immortality. Similarly, the Egyptian word wdn does not merely refer to the physical processes of labor and giving birth but also to the installation of kings and gods.



296 BLACK ATHENA
The semantic field of the name Be–s—discussed above—suggests the same combination. Armed with knives and protective symbols, Be–s and Thueris were the deities of, and guardians over, not merely physical but also spiritual birth or change of state: death and, possibly, initiation into mysteries and elevation to divinity. Sometimes the two deities cooperated but other times Be–s used the music of the drum and lyre and dances to appease the goddess and soften her savagery.95 It seems to have been in this connection that Be–s and the Thueris lion demons appeared as the guardians of gates in the Book of Coming Forth by Day.
In the Aegean, some at least of the young female helpers of Thueris/ Eileithyuia/Artemis would have been what one might call “spiritual midwives.” As such, these Muses helped people change their state and status with ceremonial and music. Therefore, poets called on the Muses or “children” for help to reach a higher state of poetic exaltation. It should also be noted that in late times Be–s was assimilated with Horus, as god of the young sun, whose Greek counterpart was Apollo. Retaining his functions as guardian of life’s passages—along with Thueris and her little or young followers—Be–s provides a convincing prototype for Apollo as the leader of the Muses and patron of music.
HOMER AND HESIOD. The names of both Homer, {Omhro", and Hesiod ÔHsivodo", are difficult to explain in terms of Indo-European. As a word “omhro" (5) means “hostage, pledge.” and some later writers used it in the sense of “blind.” Frisk and Chantraine, however, see this meaning as derived from the name of the blind poet rather than the other way around. The Egyptian etymology is from *h≥mww-r “craftsman with words.” H≥mww on its own meant “craftsman, orator.” R meant “speech, words.” Undergoing the vowel shift u–>e–would produce *h≥me\-r. Indications of the first vowel come from the general Coptic ham “craftsman,” but with a Bohairic variant hom. Thus, a form *home–-r would seem quite permissable. Chantraine believes that the name Hesiod “apparently” derives from one who hJsi “throws” his  ̧odhv“voice.” The first element can be explained more plausibly as coming from the Egyptian h≥sˆ,h≥sw or h≥syw “minstrel, singer.” It is rendered ho\s in Coptic, which would regularly derive from a Second Millennium ha\s(i) and provide an etymology for the Greek vocalization he\s. The origin of the second element is less clearcut; it could be from the Greek wode\ or from the Egyptian ˆd “child, simple person.”



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 297
RETURN TO THE MUSES. Hesiod began his Theogony:
With the Heliconian Muses let us start our song: they hold the great and holy mount of Helicon, and on their delicate feet They dance around the dark and bubbling spring .... The Muses once taught Hesiod to sing Sweet songs while he was shepherding his lambs On holy Helicon; the goddesses Olympian, daughters of Zeus who holds The aegis, first addressed these words to me: You rustic shepherds, shame: bellies you are, Not men! We know enough to make up lies Which are convincing, but we also have The skill when we've a mind, to speak the truth.
So spoke the fresh-voiced daughters of great Zeus And plucked and gave a staff to me, a shoot Of blooming laurel, wonderful to see, And breathed a sacred voice into my mouth With which to celebrate the things to come And things which were before. They ordered me To sing the race of blessed ones who live Forever, and to hymn the Muses first And at the end . . .96 And when the daughters of great Zeus would bring Honour upon a heaven favoured lord And when they watch him being born, they pour Sweet dew upon his tongue, and from his lips Flow honeyed words, all people look up to him When he is giving judgement uprightly, .... Advising with soft words. And when a lord Comes into the assembly, he is wooed With honeyed reverence just like a god, And is conspicuous above the crowd, Such is the Muses’ holy gift to men.97
Hesiod goes on to link the Muses and their music to Apollo. This



298 BLACK ATHENA
connection, too, would point to Thueris’ consort Be–s/Horus as the divinity of music and of the ceremonial for rebirth into higher realms. Nevertheless, for Hesiod the Muses, not Apollo, are at the center of the stage. In this the earliest extant and archetypal description of the Muses—and for that matter nymphs—we see all the themes that modern Europeans and Americans know and love. These graceful figures seem worlds away from the genii of Minoan and Mycenaean art and Thueris and her helpers in Middle Kingdom Egypt. Nevertheless, many of the earlier characteristics persist: flowing water, dew, washing, making plants grow, sweetness and honey, gentle daughters, using dance song and music, darkness, present at birth, raising status, giving godlike powers or initiation. We are not allowed, however, to forget the original role of the Muses and nymphs as midwives. The poem itself is called Theogony “birth of the gods” and birth is central throughout. He comes to a crescendo in the last hundred lines, where the syllables “tek” or “tik,” forms of the verb tivktw (H) ''give birth, bring forth,” sound like a metronome. This section of the poem is sometimes supposed to be spurious and to form a lead into another work, The Catalogue of Women. Whether or not this is the case, the last two verses remind us of the basic functions of the Muses as “daughters, midwives and bestowers of pain and death through childbirth.”
Now sing of women, Muses you sweet-voiced Olympian daughters of the aegis-bearing Zeus.
CONCLUSION
This complex picture of intricate intertwining and development of Egyptian, West Semitic, Anatolian, Minoan, Mycenaean and later Greek cultures demonstrates the exceptionally mixed nature of Greek civilization. It also shows the strengths of both persistence and change. The extraordinary survival and transmission of the specifics of complicated cults from Middle Kingdom Egypt to Old Palace Crete to Mycenaean Greece and on to Hesiod contrasts with the distinctiveness and new features in the Minoan genii and the transition through the bee-nymphs and leonine and sphinx-like Artemis of the Archaic period to the thoroughly humanoid nymphs and Muses of classical Greece. The process provides a clear example of the principle of modified diffusion in which ideas are



[CH. 11] MAJOR EGYPTIAN TERMS IN GREEK, 2 299
taken from their original context and blended with others to produce something that is completely new and unique to the receiving culture. Throughout all these transformations, the name “Muse” appears as a remnant and reminder of the Egyptian origin. Like that of Moses it comes from ms “child” and msi “birth.”

SIXTEEN MINOR ROOTS
CHAPTER 12
INTRODUCTION
C
alling these Egyptian words “minor” is a misnomer. They were important words in the Egyptian language and significant concepts or artifacts in Egyptian life. They are only labeled in this way in comparison to the words and roots discussed in the previous two chapters.
1. ˆmn ajmeivnwn. Orel and Stolbova postulate an Afroasiatic root *Yamin “right hand” found in Berber and Egyptian and throughout Semitic.1 It also was used for cardinal directions. Semitic speakers facing east saw Yemen to the south, whereas Egyptians, for whom the principle direction was south, saw the west as ˆmnt with the final -t of the feminine. As such, it was pronounced amnte in Sahidic, amenti in Bohairic and emnte in Akhminic. Vycichl reconstructs the original pronunciation of ˆmn as *yamina.2 As is well known, Semitic-speaking cultures strongly prefer the right side as being fortunate and clean. It is likely that the same held true in Ancient Egypt. The Greek ajmeivnwn (H) means “better, stronger.” Frisk and Chantraine, who have no etymology for it, speculate that it was originally a positive word and only later obtained the comparative suffix -o–n. An Egyptian or possibly Semitic loan word into Greek would already have



[CH. 12] SIXTEEN MINOR ROOTS 301
the comparative sense, to which it would have been altogether appropriate to add the comparative suffix. The phonetic correspondence between *yamina and ameín(on–) is good and the semantic excellent.
2. ˆsw Ai\sa, Ijso-. Aji\sa (H), already present in the Mycenaean a3 sa, is very similar to moîra in meaning: “part accorded” and, by extension, “lot, destiny.” It appears in the verb ajna-isimovw “to apply appropri
ately, dispense” and in a number of words with the stem aijsumn- aisymn“magistrate, arbiter in the games.” Aîsa is supposed to have an IndoEuropean cognate in the Oscan aetis ”portion.” The disappearance of the Greek medial -s- creates problems with this and any Indo-European etymology. The Greek root would seem more likely to come from the Egyptian isw, Coptic asu (S) and esu- (A) “fair reward, compensation to which one is entitled.”3 It is interesting that the lexicographers do not associate aîsa with is[o", and the prefix isjo-, both of which have very much the same connotations. This failure seems to be the result of Boiotian and Cretan forms with a  ̧ digamma. Frisk and Chantraine are convinced that the original form was * ̧is ̧o.” They cannot find an etymology for this reconstruction, however, because in Greek the /s/ disappeared from the PIE *sw. Therefore, the two lexicographers added a /d/ constructing *wid-s-wos. Chantraine considered linking this to the root *weid “to see, know.” Meillet, on the other hand, hypothesized a *witwo, thereby linking it to “two!” As mentioned in Chapter 5, the ancient initial  ̧ did not always represent a genetic Indo-European /w/. Failure to elide and the letter itself can be the result of borrowings from Afroasiatic initial Œayin or >aleph.4 The strong phonetic resemblance and the close semantic relationship with aîsa make a loan from the Egyptian ˆsw for both seem preferable to these convolutions. Thus, the Egyptian isw is almost certainly the etymon of both aîsa, ísos—feminine eíse,\—“equal in share, number or right.” Such compounds of iso- as isonomía “equal laws” and ise\goria “to speak as an equal” were, of course, critical in the formation of Greek democratic theory.5 Finally, there is a[xio" (H) “counterbalance, equivalent in value, just price.” The semantic fit with ˆsw is excellent; the phonetic is somewhat less so. Egyptian s- is rendered as xi in the generally accepted borrowing sft > xíphos and, in Chapter 11, I argued that the divine name and symbol of initiation, Bs, is expressed in the ecstatic cry pavx kogx.6 In addition, xi and sigma are exchanged within Greek. The vowel or glide /i/



302 BLACK ATHENA
remains a slight problem since it is not enough to block the powerful semantic case. Chantraine associates áxios with a[gw a verb with many meanings: “to lead, drive, push, marry etc.” He specifies the sense of “weigh.” This meaning is not given in his lemma on the word or in that in Lidell, Scott and Jones.
3. Wr ˆb u{bri". The Egyptian compound wr ˆb or ŒÅ ˆb literally means “great heart.” Interestingly, however, it was always used pejoratively as “arrogant or insolent.” The Greek u{bri" (H) also means “unwarranted pride, insolence.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine can give it an IndoEuropean etymology. Chantraine is skeptical of Szemerényi’s proposal that it derives from a Hittite *huwapar “outrage,” reconstructed on the basis of a verb hup ”maltreat.”7 The frequency of the exchange of the liquids /l/ or /r/ between third and second positions was mentioned in Chapter 88 and the Greek upsilon is always aspirated. These make the phonetic correspondence between wr ˆb and hybris very strong. The semantic match is perfect.
4. BÅh≥ fal(l)ov". Gábor Takács suggests that the most plausible origin for the Egyptian bÅh≥ “foreskin, phallus” is an Afroasiatic root *b-l “penis.” The Greek fallo", phallus (5), sometimes with a single lamda as in favlh~, was replaced in Ionian by the Thraco-Phrygian form ballivon, ballíon. Chantraine argues on the basis of this and the forms fallhvn and favllaina that the Indo-European root was *bhl-¢nó- “to swell, inflate.” The Greek term definitely refers to an erect phallus. This reference, however, leads to the phallic cult of Dionysos. Both Herodotos and Diodoros emphasized the connections between this cult and Egypt. Paul Foucart made a powerful case backing the ancient claim and such connections have been shown earlier in this volume.9 For this reason the Egyptian etymology would seem preferable to the Indo-European.
5. Mstˆ mavsqlh", msdt mastov", mtd mavstix, msdˆ misevw. The Late Egyptian mstˆ “leather bucket,” provides a plausible etymology for the otherwise unexplained mavsqlh" (5) “leather objects.” The Coptic mesthet\ “breast” and the Late Egyptian msdt derive from mstˆ h≥Åty “leather bucket of the heart.” This serves as an origin for the Greek mastov" (H)(masqo", and mazov") “breast.” Chantraine reconstructs an earlier *madto" and tentatively links this to madavw “spoiled by humidity”! The word mtd “whip lashes” may be a Semitic loan word into Egyptian,



[CH. 12] SIXTEEN MINOR ROOTS 303
but it would also serve as an etymology for the Greek mavstix (H) “whip.”10 Chantraine derives the latter as an “expressive form of maivomai to search, touch or reach.” Frisk and Chantraine are unable to find an etymology for misevw (H) “to hate.” Interestingly, however, it has a number of forms with a dental: mishtov" (5) “hate, hateful” and mishvth “prostitute.” These can be explained as morphological. Equally, however, they could be remnants of an earlier form. The Egyptian msdi “dislike, hate” provides a perfect semantic correspondence and a reasonable phonetic one.
6. nw (Å) lavw, novo", noerov". The anthropologist Colin Turnbull described the Ik of northeast Uganda in miserable and hostile terms. In their language, noos is a word for “cleverness.” In the more highfalutin Greek terminology reserved for European cultures, novo" (H) means “intelligence.”11 On the face of things, it would seem absurd to see this as anything other than random coincidence. If we dig deeper, the relationship becomes more complicated. There is no doubt that in each case the final -s came from different sources. The Ik source is uncertain but may be a stative suffix and the Greek the usual masculine nominative singular suffix -os. Before coming to the root, however, we need to consider both the semantic field and the immediate origin of the Greek term. Nearly every language shows a close relationship between seeing and knowing. To take an Indo-European example, the Latin video\“I see” and the Greek idei`n “have seen” belong to the same family as the Greek ( ̧)oid`a (w) oîda and German wissen “know” and the English “wit.” Chantraine defines the meaning of the Greek word novo" intelligence, spirit, in so far as one sees or thinks.” The verb noevw (H) means “to see, perceive.” There are also the adjectives noero", noerós and nohrh “intelligent.” Frisk proposes an Indo-European root also found in the Gothic: snutrs “intelligent.” Chantraine denies this and other still less likely hypotheses and states baldly that the word has no etymology. In Egyptian nw(Å), transcribed in cuneiform as nawa and as nau in Coptic, means “to see, watch, hunt.”12 In this it is extremely close in both phonetics and semantics to the Greek lavw (H) “to see look, watch, hunt.”13 Frisk and Chantraine are skeptical of previous attempts to find an etymology for this word. The same derivation for it and nóos and noéo\ is equally unassailable. On the other hand, it is unlikely, although just possible, that the /r/ in noerós and noe\re\:s come from the form nw(Å). . . .



304 BLACK ATHENA
The Egyptian nw belongs to a widespread Afroasiatic family of words from the root *na> “to see,” found in Berber, Chadic and Lowland East Cushitic.14 Interestingly, however, Ehret has reconstructed a similar root *no–“to watch, listen, observe” in Nilo-Saharan. It would seem very likely the two are related. Ik is a Nilo-Saharan language and it is from *no–that Ehret derives the Ik word noos.15 Thus, there is a connection—if distant—between the Ik and Greek words for intelligence.
7. Nmˆ, nmŒ, nm nevmo", nevmw, novmo", nevmesi", nomavde". The Greek root ÷nm, which is generally entered in the etymological dictionaries under the heading nevmw (H), has an extraordinarily rich and wide semantic range. The verb itself is usually classified in two ways: first as “to distribute food, booty etc.” and second as “to graze, pasture.” Linked to the latter is némo\in the sense “to inhabit.” The fact that these are not entirely discrepant is shown by the specialized meaning “to allocate pasture.” Divided along the same general lines are the nouns nomhv and nomov", meaning both “pasture” and “distribute.” A later form novmo" (5) developed into the general sense of “law.” From this came nomivzw (6) “to regulate, follow custom” and, by extension, “to acknowledge, believe.” Nevmesi" (H) means “just allocation or fate.” On the pasture side, there are nevmo" (H) “heath, wildwood,” nomav", nomavde" “nomad, nomads” and the proper noun Numavde" “Numidians.” Chantraine maintains that némos is never pasture but always “bush,” even extending to female pubic hair. Therefore, it is not to be associated with némo\or nomós. He sees it as possibly related to the Latin nemus ”sacred wood” and the latter’s Celtic cognates. On the other hand, Ernout and Meillet point out that, unlike the Latin and Celtic forms, the Greek némos is far from sacred. Thus it would be better to leave the non-Greek forms out of the picture and to treat the Greek ones as a single cluster. The etymology for némo\is universally seen as deriving from an IndoEuropean stem found in the Teutonic family: the Gothic niman and the German nehmen “to take.”16 The lack of semantic congruence between giving and taking is not quite as absurd as it might appear. As my colleague Frederick Ahl puts it in the case of Greek “every word means something, its opposite and something dirty.” Nevertheless, the association of nem- “to give” with nem- “to take” can only stand if it is without a challenger. Nmˆ in Middle Egyptian means “to travel.” Interestingly, it is often



[CH. 12] SIXTEEN MINOR ROOTS 305
written with the sign of the winding wall # (O5). Whether pronounced
as nm or mr, it is associated with cattle. It is also used, for instance, in nmˆ “to low as cattle.”17 The well-known “Minoan” mural from Tel ed Dab'a also shows a young man on a bull against a background of wind
ing walls.18 The same sign appears in some writings of nmˆw ßŒ “Bedouin,” literally “sandfarers.” The association with cattle occurs indiscriminately in words with nm, mr or mn. Mnˆ is “to be a herdsman” and mnˆw “herdsmen.” This provides an etymology for the Minuvai Minyans (H). The etymology of this gentilic is made plausible by their inhabiting Boiwtiva, Boio–tía “cattle country.” In Coptic mane (S) mani (B) was “to graze animals.” Although the connection is not as tight as with mnˆw the connection between nmˆ(w) and nomadic cattle herders is still clear. There was even a Macedonian word novmio", nómios “shepherd.” Unfortunately, because nmi(w) was not transcribed into cuneiform and did not survive into Coptic, it is difficult to reconstruct the vowels. Thus, the phonetics of the loans into Greek are merely reasonable. The semantic side is strengthened, however, by an attested Late Egyptian form nmŒ “to set out or lay down
walls.” This form uses # (O5). This meaning corresponds well with
what seems to be the original and central meaning of némo\“to allocate pasture.”19
8. Nsyt novso", nou`so". Despite attempts to explain the survival of the medial -s- by postulating an original *nos ̧o" “illness,” neither Frisk nor Chantraine can find any etymology for the word. The most plausible source is the Egyptian nsyt “illness, demon of illness.”20 The uncertainty of the vowels is more than made up for by the semantic correspondence reinforced by the central role of Egyptian learning in the formation of Greek medicine.21
9. Ndm nhvdumo". Pokorny fails to explain nhvdumo" “sweet.” Homer only applied the word to sleep but the range was probably wider and later writers used it more generally. Neither Pokorny nor Chantraine could accept Pisani’s derivation of it from nhvdu" “stomach, womb or other bodily cavity.”22 The most likely etymology for ne\dymos is from the Egyptian ndm “sweet, pleasant, whole, comfortable.” The Coptic vocalization for the adjectival form is nut\em and, as in all Coptic dialects, earlier /a–/ became /u–/ after nasal consonants, as opposed to the general shift a



306 BLACK ATHENA
>o–.23 The Canaanite cognate nåŒe\m “pleasant, soothing” strengthens the value /a–/ of the earlier form. Given the general Greek shift a– > e, the phonetic fit would seem to be almost as good as the semantic. A reduced first vowel causing a prothetic one, however, seems to be the origin of the name jEndumivwn for the beautiful young hero who was granted everlasting sleep. Chantraine complains that the Homeric word h{dumo" “sweet” is “always transmitted under the mistaken form ne\dymos.” There is no doubt that hJduv" “pleasant, sweet” derives from the Indo-European *swat (*suad) “sweet.” The source of he\dymos is unexplained. It would seem to be a portmanteau word made up of he\dús and ne\dymos.
10. H≥tr eJtai`ro", e}tero". The Egyptian word h≥tr is clearly linked to the Arabic h≥atar “to fix, make a knot.” It has two further competing etymologies. The first is from a root ÷d≥ugur “to darn” found in the West Chadic language Sura. Such a connection would require a number of important phonetic changes including metathesis. The second is to relate h≥tr to a Semitic root ÷h≥tl. “bandage or swaddling.”24 The general sense of the Egyptian word is “to bind together.” It has two specialized meanings: one is “to be bound, to pay one’s taxes”; the other is “to attach or yoke a pair of oxen together” to pull a plow or cart. With the arrival of chariots during the Second Intermediate period, it became the name for a pair of horses. In Coptic hto, plural hto\o\r, means “horse, horses.” However, the sense of “two bound together” survived in the word hatre “twin.” The Greek e{tero", a2tero in Linear B has as its basic meaning “one of two.” Chantraine sees the suffix -tero as an indication of the dual and the word as a whole from a hypothetical stem *sm≥teros which he sees also in the Sanskrit eka-tara. This would seem equally plausible as a derivation from htr, if it were not for similar word, eJtai'ro" (H) “comrade, companion” and in Macedonian “horsemen.” (Usually two men rode in a war chariot.) Neither Frisk nor Chantraine links hetaîros to héteros. Instead, they see hetaîros as coming from an Indo-European root *sweta found in the Old Russian svatu=“brother-in-law” and in the Greek e[tai (sometimes Feta-) “companions.” The aspiration of hetaîros and its distinctive ending provide slight phonetic difficulties for this etymology.25 But the Egyptian etymology from h≥tr can explain the striking phonetic and semantic similarities between héteros and hetaîros and the connection with horses.

11. H°dˆ kavta. The Greek preposition and adverb kavta, káta (H) covers a semantic field unparalleled in any other Indo-European language. Frisk describes it as “down, against, along, through.” Chantraine sees the general sense as “to adapt oneself to” or “toward the bottom.” He states that it “ought” to correspond to the Hittite kata “with, below” and the Welsh cant and Irish cet- “with.” The Egyptian H°dˆ means “to travel northwards or downstream” or “flow of water.” The Sahidic and Boharic descendents hate and h°ati convey the same sense, “to flow, pour down, current.” This corresponds perfectly with Chantraine’s general sense of “to adapt oneself to.” The semantic fit between h°dˆ and káta is strengthened by such common terms as katarrevw (H) “flow down,” katarJovon (H) “downstream” and katarravkth" (5) “waterfall, particularly of the Nile.” Káta has a sense of flowing water that supposed Indo-European cognates lack. Such precision makes an Egyptian etymology competitively plausible. It is possible that the Hittite form was also borrowed from Egyptian.
12. Sgr(ˆ) si'ga. The Greek si'ga (H) is “silence.” In Homer the verb *sigavw has only one form, the imperative síga.\ Chantraine is skeptical, on phonetic grounds, of any attempt to link this word to the Old High German swigan, German schweigen. Given the initial s-, it is almost certainly a loan and the Middle Egyptian sgr(i) “silence” is a very good candidate for the source. As mentioned in Chapter 9, *pÅ sgr “the silence” provides a strong etymology for pségos “tomb.”26
13. Sdr stratov". Stratov" (H) “camp, army” is a very fruitful stem in Greek: strathgov" “general,” strathgevw “to lead an army,” strathgov" “general,” strathgiva “strategy,” stratioth" “soldier” and strateuvw “to campaign.” The lexicographers agree that the basis is stratós “camp.” They derive this from a stem found in the Sanskrit str≥ta and the Avestan stErEta “to stretch out” and the Latin sternum. Another possibility, not noted by these scholars, is the Semitic root ÷sdr “to set in order” found in the Akkadian, sidru, sidirtu “row, battle line.” This root, however, does not have “camp” as the primary meaning. I maintain that the most likely source is the Egyptian root sdr “to pass the night” and the noun sdryt “sleeping place.” In Late Egyptian sdrt meant “night camp, bivouac.” The possibility that the Egyptian sdrt was already developing some of the other meanings found in Greek is suggested by the Demotic verb and noun sdy “fight, warrior, hero.”



308 BLACK ATHENA
14. Dpt devpa". Written dipa in Linear B because of a unique innovation e>i in that dialect, dépas meant “large vessel” and later “drinking cup.”27 None of the standard lexicographers offers an Indo-European etymology for it. The only evidence of one comes from a form tepas cited by Laroche from hieroglyphic Hittite. It does not, however, appear in his Luvian dictionary nor do Chadwick or ten Cate, whose work appeared several years later, mention it.28 Even if this form and its meaning are confirmed, it would not rule out the possibility of an Egyptian etymology for both words. We know that there were Lycians in New Kingdom Egypt.29 The Iron Age name of a Lycian high official or nobleman, Mizretiye, indicates that men of Egyptian descent or claiming contact with Egypt lived in that country.30 The word natr- is also used on a trilingual inscription and since the Greek clearly means “god,” it must derive from the Egyptian ntr.31 Other Egyptian cultic and cultural penetration of Anatolia has been discussed above in Chapter 10. The Egyptian etymology for dépas is from dpt “boat.” This has been vocalized for Middle Egyptian in various ways. Working on the basis of an apparently intrusive w, which occasionally appeared before the feminine ending -t, Gardiner reconstructed a form *dàpet from an earlier
dápwat in the “absolute” and *depwat(ef) in the construct.32 Semantically, it is very easy to go from vessel to vessel or, in Greek, from gau'lo" “Phoenician ship” to gaulo", “bucket” and gauli", “oil lamp” all of which come from the Canaanite gullåh “basin, bowl, bowl
of oil lamp,” probably to be reconstructed *gwa/El.33 The clinching argument that dépas derives from dpt comes from a reference by Pherekydes to a dépas in which the sun travels across the ocean at night.34 The technical terms for this very Egyptian concept were wˆÅ and mŒndt. Even so, a dpt ntr “sacred bark” is attested in the Pyramid Texts as the “ship of the sun god” and later as Osiris’ festival. Thus, Pherekydes was undoubtedly referring to dpt. Another plausible derivation from dpt in this sense is divfro" “litter, chariot, vehicle of the sun throne.” Chantraine argues with some phonetic difficulty that it is based on di “twice,” because of two-person chariots. He has no explanation for the final -phros. Thus, this etymology, like that of dépa(s) for díphros from dpt, is extremely plausible.35
15. Dmˆ da–'mo", dhvmo". Allan Bomhard reconstructs a Nostratic root *t'im or *t'em “to build, construct” with *t'om for “house.” He only finds it in the Sumerian dím “to make, build” and the well-known Indo



[CH. 12] SIXTEEN MINOR ROOTS 309
European root.36 This root occurs in the Greek demo\ “construct” and démas “form structure”; the Gothic timrjan “to make with wood” from which derives the German zimmer “woodwork” hence “room” and our “timber”; the Latin domus and the Slavic dom “house, building.” The original sense, however, appears not to have been working wood but building by tying reeds together. Thus, in Sumerian one finds dím also in the sense of “tie fast.” In Indo-European, too, the basic sense of “bind together” was retained and used for people. This explains what Benveniste saw as a basic discrepancy between the Greek dómos “house as a building” and the Latin domus “home as a social unit.”37 In the latter sense we see the Greek davmnumi “tame,” as well as the Teutonic root from which we derive “to tame,” in the sense of to bind the animal. The Egyptian root ÷dm meaning “to bind” found in dmÅ which with that meaning may well be descended from Nostratic *t'm. Afroasiatic /t'/ broke down in Egyptian to /d/ or /t/. A possible pair for dmÅ is tmÅ “mat.” As in Indo-European, the “binding” could also have social connotations. It is present in dmd “assemble,” dmdw “crowd,” dmˆ “join,” dmˆ “town, village” and dmˆ w “fellow citizens.” The Greek word da'–mo", dhvmo" in Attic and Ionic is attested in Linear B as damo, which John Chadwick took to mean “an entity which can allocate holdings of land probably a village.”38 The Homeric de\mos seems to have been a township with land but more emphasis is on the people. The Athenian “demes,” which according to legend were founded by Kekrops and Erekhtheus with their Egyptian connotations, were both territorial and tribal divisions. Presumably because of both the semantic and phonetic difficulties, no scholar has to my knowledge tried to link da\Ámos to the Indo-European root *t'em discussed above. Pokorny, Chantraine and Frisk have associated it with the Old Irish dam “troop or following.” Despite the lack of any traces outside Greek and Celtic, these could belong to an otherwise lost Indo-European root. A genetic relationship would be plausible in the absence of any challenger. In this case, however, there is a challenger. Within the semantic field, the Egyptian dmˆ “town, village or quarter” and its inhabitants would seem to fit the Greek da\Ámos perfectly. Phonetically, there is, however, some uncertainty. In Coptic, the city Dmˆ n H≥r “city of Horus,” was rendered Timenhur, although it later became Damanhour in Arabic. The cities called Dmˆ tyw “citizens” or “people of the port,” became Tamiati or Damietta in Arabic. In any event, in



310 BLACK ATHENA
some cases there was vocalization with an /a/ that would allow for a loan into the Greek da\Ámos. Other pieces of evidence indicating the possibility of loaning from Egyptian are the following words: the Lydian dumus “community”??, the Etruscan tamiathur “college” and the Phrygian dumos “council assembly.”39 The close physical neighborhood, but distant linguistic relationship, of these two languages has been mentioned above. The Phrygian dumos cannot be related genetically to da\Ámos, because of both the vocalization and the fact that the normal Greek correspondence to the Phrygian /d/ is /th/. Thus, it would seem more likely that loaning is involved. While the etymology of da\Ámos from dmˆ is not certain, given the weakness of the Indo-European parallel, the Egyptian etymology is plausible. The origin of e[qno", a synonym of da\Ámos, was given in Chapter 8.40 The Semitic origin of la–o", a synonym of da\Ámos and ethnos, will be discussed in Chapter 13.41 For other words on groups of people, see Chapter 17. On the semantic side, there is a remarkable parallel between “many”
“the assembled multitude” and “the inferiors” found in ókhlos from Œs=Å and the apparent calque hoi pollói.42
16. Dsrw qhsaurov". A major book has been devoted to the Egyptian term dsr. Its author James Karl Hoffmeier, sees it as cognate, with metathesis, to the Ugaritic and Hebrew grs= “to drive out or away.” This seems plausible in terms of the Egyptian meaning, which Hoffmeier sees as “brandishing a stick, to purify a passage or to clear a place ritually.”43 It resembles the English expression “beating the bounds.” The idea of the space secured in this way exists in the Canaanite migrås= “zone around a town for pasturing.” As an adjective dsr meant “holy, sacred,” which in the Egyptian iconic religion was extended to signify “splendid, costly.” Dsrw “seclusion” with the house determinative meant “holy place, sanctum.” Dsr dsrw was the “holy of holies,” the temple at Deir el Bahri. The\saurós (H) is a “storehouse in which one secures provisions, precious objects or treasure.” The most famous examples were the sacred “treasuries” at Delphi. Frisk states that this word is “without an etymology.” Chantraine believes that it could be a loan. The semantic parallels between the Egyptian and Greek words are exact. Unfortunately, as dsr was not transcribed into Akkadian and does not appear to have survived into Coptic, the vocalization cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the



[CH. 12] SIXTEEN MINOR ROOTS 311
consonantal fit is exact and the final -w would seem to correspond to the accented -ós. In short, the case for an Egyptian origin of the\saurós is overwhelming.
CONCLUSION
The sixteen featured etymologies in this chapter were selected on two bases: the importance of the Greek words derived and the strength of the case for derivation. The choice was not easy as I have many others that are very nearly as impressive according to both criteria.

SEMITIC SIBILANTS
CHAPTER 13
INTRODUCTION
I
n Chapter 8 I looked at the progress of the Egyptian letter ß con
ventionally transcribed /s=/ from /h°/ to /s=/. I drew an analogy from transcriptions from the Hebrew /s=/ into Greek cq, sc, cs, and s.1 The situation of sibilants within Semitic is even more complicated than that. At this point, I shall not be treating the voiced or emphatic sibilants, which will be considered with individual loans. I shall restrict myself to those that are unvoiced and unemphatic. It is generally recognized that Proto-Semitic had three of this type, conventionally labeled /s1/, /s2/ and /s3/. It has also been generally considered that /s1/ corresponds to the Canaanite and Aramaic letter si=n, /s2/ to the Hebrew sivn and /s3/ to samekh. In Phoenician, unlike the more conservative Hebrew, sinvmerged with si=n. In Hebrew sivn remained independent until much later when it and the Aramaic sivn merged with samekh. It is, therefore, maintained that up to then Hebrew retained the original values.2 In both Arabic and Ge’ez the modification was different. In both these, /s3/ merged with /s1/ and /s2/ remained independent but corresponded phonetically to the old /s3/. Correspondences with cognates in other Afroasiatic languages go against the conventional wisdom that in Proto-Semitic /s1/ was originally /s=/. These cognates suggest that the generally more conservative



[CH. 13] SEMITIC SIBILANTS 313
Arabic and Ge'ez have preserved the original correspondence /s1/= /s/. In the First Millennium BCE loans and transcriptions from Akkadian /s1/ tended to be rendered as /s1/(s3) in Canaanite. This is generally seen as the result of an Akkadian shift /s±/ to /s/. This correspondence could be explained equally well or better by Akkadian having kept the original /s1/=/s/, while the Canaanite /s1/ shifted to /s=/.3 It is difficult to say when exactly the shift took place but it would seem to have been during the last half of the Second Millennium BCE.

Alphabetic transcription of these sibilants further increases the complexity. The earliest letter forms appear to have been S, “checker
board” and s. The first, a later horizontal form of which ç, became the
Canaanite si=n. The Greek letter, however, took its name sigma with metathesis from the Phoenician letter name samekh. The Semitic letter samekh itself, the “checkerboard,” was altered by the shaft slipping down below
the three horizontals to form samekh: i.–––In the more conservative Greek and Italic alphabets, the modifications were the less drastic modifications of the “checkerboard,” X, X or xi.4 I have questioned above whether this letter always had the value /ks/. Rather, the /k/ was probably a soft fricative /kh/, not a plosive. Thus, it may simply have stood for a fricative plus sibilant /khs/.5 Furthermore, it is striking that in all the Mycenaean forms identified with a later xi the vowels are repeated: kese, kisi, kusu etc. Syllabaries are by their nature unable to represent double consonants. Thus, such repetitions should not be segmented into k-s but, like xi itself, seem to represent fricatives rather than stops united with sibilants.6
LOANS OF SIBILANTS FROM CANAANITE INTO GREEK
Greek lacked this multiplicity of unvoiced sibilants. Therefore, in loans from West Semitic or Akkadian before 1200 BCE, /s1/-/s/, later /s3/,



314 BLACK ATHENA
was rendered as /s/. For instance, s=s=mn, the conventional Ugaritic and Phoenician transcription, was written sasama in Linear B and shvsamon in alphabetic Greek. The Canaanite and Hebrew s=ôs=an or s=us=an “lily” became sou'son soûson (4).7 After 1200 BCE, borrowings from Canaanite and Aramaic /s1/-/s=/ still sometimes remained /s/ but equally often became /skh/, /khs/, /ks/ and, very likely, /sk/.8 This temporal pattern is the opposite of Greek borrowings from the Egyptian sign transcribed as /s=/. For examples of Greek renditions of the Egyptian /s=/ as first /k/ and /kh/, see Chapter 8 above.9 For renditions from the later development /skh/, there are s=nw “rope, net” in Late Egyptian “circuit, enclosure, cartouche,” Mycenaean kono, koino and the Greek scoi'no" (H) “reed, grass, rope, net, bind.” Then there is scediva (H) “raft” from the Egyptian s=dw “raft.” Chantraine provides no etymology for either. For a Canaanite example, there is the verb ÷sl=w/h “rest, repose, prosperity,” an adjectival form of which is vocalized s=ålê.10 This corresponds
to the Greek scolhv (5) “leisure, tranquility.” Chantraine sees this meaning as having gone through a “remarkable evolution” to become “study.” Aristotle explained this relationship as the necessity of leisure for scholarship.11 I find it more plausible to suppose that the two meanings come from two different sources, the second being the Canaanite ÷svkl and Aramaic ÷skl “to be attentive, understand.”
1. s=l, slh≥, s=lh,° s=ll Sku'la, Skuleuvw, Skuvlax, Sku–lavw, Skuvllw, sulavw “to peel or strip.” The Semitic biconsonantal root ÷s=/sl= “draw out, extract” is found with that meaning in the Hebrew ÷sl=h. As ÷sl=h≥ it is “to cast out, send away” and as ÷sl=l “to spoil, plunder.” The basic meaning seems to be that of the Arabic salah°a “to flay an animal, strip the bark from a tree.”12 C+erny and Vycichl both reject the notion that the Coptic s=ol\ “to strip, pillage, booty” is a Semitic loan on the grounds that it appears as hl° in Demotic and the Akhminite dialect of Coptic. Given the exact semantic correspondence and the uncertainty of the pronunciation of the Canaanite /s/, as well as the uncertainty created by the merger of Egyptian /h°/ with/s=/ during the First Millennium BCE, their denial seems to me to be misplaced precision. The Greek sku'la (5) means “arms taken from a beaten enemy.” In the singular, sku'lon (5) is “booty,” skuleuvw (H) is “to take the arms from a beaten enemy,” sku–lavw “to pillage,” skuvllw (5) “to tear or rend dead bodies” and skuvlax (H) “puppy, young dog” is an animal



[CH. 13] SEMITIC SIBILANTS 315
(with the animal suffix -ak) that does such things. Chantraine links skyllo to skavllw (5) “to stir up, hoe, scratch.” Pokorny derives skállo from an Indo-European root *skel with such cognates as the Gothic skilja “butcher” and the Icelandic skilja “divide.” There may well be confusion here between the Indo-European and Semitic roots. The Semitic source does not gain its advantage over the Indo-European etymology merely from the closer semantic parallels. Other Greek words with the same or similar meanings appear to have derived from earlier West Semitic pronunciations of /s1/ as /s/. The first of these, which is clear-cut and was proposed by Lewy, is sulavw (H) “to strip the arms from an enemy, pillage.”13 Chantraine describes this etymology as obscure. At a further remove is xuvlon (H) “brushwood, wood, to burn or use for construction, wood that has been worked.” Chantraine proposes an Indo-European root for this *ksulo, which he finds in Germanic and in the Lithuanian s=ùlas “stick, pillar.” He does not see a connection between xylon and xevvw (H) and xuvw (H) “to scrape, scratch, polish.” Chantraine sees xéo\as a metathesis of a root *qes found in the Old Slav çesati “comb.” Xuo\has many derivatives with a final -r , which could link it to the -l in the Semitic root. Chantraine, however, sees xurovn (H) “knife, razor” as corresponding exactly to the Sanskrit kxura, which may have originally meant this. As the form only appears in these two languages, he raises, but dismisses, the possibility that they were both loans from another language. Given the semantic unity and the phonetic similarities, it seems to me that these words are more plausibly explained as belonging to a single cluster borrowed over a period in which the Canaanite /s=/ was heard as an unclear sibilant. Given the uncertainty of the early value of xi, it is impossible to be sure that this sound was ks. There could be an even earlier borrowing u{lh (H). This and its derivatives generally have the sense of “wood, forest.” More precisely and as opposed to the clearly Indo-European devndra déndra “tree,” hyle\means “brushwood, wood that has been cut down for fuel.” This, too, according to Frisk and Chantraine, has no Indo-European etymology. Thus, it would seem plausible to postulate that hyle\too was a loan from ÷slh,° in this case, given before the Greek shift s>h. A parallel can be found in the pair a’llomai and the Latin salio both meaning “to jump” and having no other Indo-European cognates. Their relationship can be explained as deriving from the Semitic root ÷sll “to lift up, cast up” the Greek word being introduced before and the Latin after the shift.



316 BLACK ATHENA
2. Se–m sh'ma, s=e–m Sch'ma “name, sign.” The Late Canaanite s=embelongs to an abundant family found not merely in Semitic but throughout Afroasiatic. Orel and Stolbova derive this family from a reconstructed root *süm.14 Their reason for marking the initial sibilant as plain /s/ is that this is the sibilant in the overwhelming majority of non-Semitic versions and in south Arabian it is s1m.15 Thus, before 1000 BCE the Canaanite word would have been heard as se\m and after it as s=e\m. The Greek borrowings provide clear examples of borrowing, before and after that approximate date. In Chapter 5 I discussed the phonetic relationship between se@m^a “tomb” and so@$ma “corpse” that had intrigued Plato.16 The Greek poet linked the former to sh'ma (H) “sign-particularly in or from heaven, mark, token.” Frisk writes of this latter sense: “It appears to be an inherited word but with no persuasive etymology.” On semantic grounds neither he nor Chantraine can accept the etymology originally put forward by Brugmann linking it to the Sanskrit dhya\-man “thought.” While the semantic fits of se@!matos “tomb” with smÅ tÅ and se@!ma< se@!m “sign” are excellent, there is a phonetic problem in that the Doric sa`ma indicates that the original form had a long /a–/. This form, however, is not attested in Linear B and, therefore, could have entered Ionic Greek after the shift a–>e–but before the Canaanite shift s>s=. In this case, the Doric form would have been an analogical back formation. All lexicographers link sch'ma (5) “to form, shape figure” to the verb e[cw “to hold, possess,” which has /s/ in its root. The final -ma is also explicable. Nevertheless, the semantic gap is vast, and, on both grounds, it is simpler to see it as a later borrowing from se!@m “name, brand, mark, token.”
3. >Esmun jIsmhnov", Smhnov", Sminqeuv", >Es=mun Skavmandro" “fertile, prosperous.” In zero grade (as the Indo-Europeanists express it) and with a prothetic vowel, ÷smn “fat, prosperous” fits the course of the river jIsmhnov", cascading from Thebes into the rich plain of the Kopais.17 The river has long been associated with the Canaanite healer god >Esmun.18 In his aspect as healer Apollo was identified with >Esmun. He was worshipped at Thebes as Apollo Isme–vnios.19 Then there is the river Smhno" in southern Lakonia, about which Pausanias wrote: “If ever river water were fresh to drink, this was it.” Nearby was a temple of Asklepios and Artemis.20 The identification of Asklepios with Artemis’s twin, Apollo in his reviving and healing aspect will be discussed in Chap



[CH. 13] SEMITIC SIBILANTS 317
ter 19. The joy of salvation from death and other perils can be expressed
as a[smenoV (H).
Apollo’s relationship with ÷smn occurs in his biname Sminqeuv". Smivnqio" Smínthios was also a month name in Rhodes. The scholiast on the Iliad stated that this came from smivnqo" and was a Cretan word for “mouse.”21 The scholiast also mentions a town in the Troad called Smínthos and Stephanus Byzantius linked it to a town in the Troad called Smivnqh, although these have never been located. The lack of attestation of the word or cult on mainland Greece and the consonant cluster -nthled twentieth-century scholars to assume that both were pre-Hellenic, despite the preference to see Apollo as the Hellenic god par excellence.22 More probably the name Smintheús resembled those of Amalatheia and Eileithyia, which were made up of an Afroasiatic root with the IndoEuropean suffix -thea/os.23 The later form ÷s=mn also appears to have reflexes in Greece. In Chapter 10, I noted that, among other things, in the language of the gods Xánthos was the name of the river near Troy.24 On the other hand, it was called Skavmandro" in the language of men. In Homeric meter the initial sk- was treated as a single consonant, which suggests a borrowing from a foreign sibilant /s=/. In this case, the stem skaman can be plausibly derived from the Canaanite s=åmån “fat, fertile place.” The latter would be entirely appropriate for the “fair-flowing, divine, nurtured-by-Zeus” river Skámandros, flowing through the “wheat-bearing” plain.25 There was also a Larissa that, as seen in Chapter 9 above, meant “entry to the fertile land.”26 In Chapter 10, I also mentioned Homeric references to the “eddying Xánthos” as the holy child of Zeus.27 There I linked him to Herakles, but Xánthos could also refer to Apollo, another son of Zeus, with whom Herakles shared many, largely solar, connections. In Chapter 10, I also mentioned that the river fought on the Trojan side with Apollo, Artemis and Leto and was considered powerful enough to be a match for Hephaistos.28 Such implicit associations of Xánthos with Apollo are strengthened by connections with the god through Skámandros and the Semitic root, ÷smn/÷s=mn.
4. Sí-in xuvn, suvn “with.” Nearly all Greek prepositions have clear Indo-European etymologies. The Egyptian etymology of káta was discussed in the last chapter; the only other exception is xyn (H) or syn (H) “with.” Some Indo-Europeanists have attempted to place it with *sem,



318 BLACK ATHENA
“same.” Most, however, recognize that this is impossible because of the shift s>h and because of what seems to be older writing with xi. Chantraine preferred to reconstruct a *ksu (dropping the final -n). apparently confirmed by the discovery of ku-su in Linear B. While explaining the survival of the sibilant, this approach makes it difficult to relate to any potential Indo-European cognates beginning with s-.29 Given the evidence above, it would seem reasonable to look for a loan from a fricative sibilant. The candidate proposed here is the Eblaite sí-in “movement to, up to.” The phonetic problem with this is the nature of the Eblaite /s/. As stated above, I am inclined to believe that in ProtoSemitic /s1/ was /s/ rather than /s=/ as it is conventionally rendered. This is strengthened by the Gunnan Gurage preposition sEn “until, up to, as far as,” which Wolf Leslau plausibly derived from a verb sänä “to arrive, reach.”30 Fabrizio Pennacchietti, however, sees cognates in epigraphic South Arabian as s1n or s3n and in Qatabanian and Minaean as s2n . Nevertheless, despite the great uncertainty about the value of the Eblaite /s/, it was unlikely to have been a clear /s/.31 The other phonetic problem is the lack of a final -n in the Linear B kusu. It would have been difficult, however, to represent this letter in the syllabary. Thus, there is no reason to doubt that it was present well before it is attested in alphabetic Greek. The semantic problem is not insuperable. First, it should be remembered that Classical Greek had an Indo-European word for “with” in méta, which survives in Greek today as me. The division between “with” and “up to” is bridged by the sense that on arrival one is “with.” Interestingly, the South Arabian forms cited above all had Œd “up to” as a prefix.
5. Svne\> xevno" “hated stranger.” The Greek stem xén(w)o- refers to foreigners or guests. Professor Calvert Watkins breaks up the k and the s in x and sees xénos as “the zero grade of the root *ghos-”—English “guest” Latin hostis.32 Watkins’s claim is remarkable because, although traditional among Indo-Europeanists, it has been rejected by the lexicographers.33 Even Julius Pokorny, ever eager to find Indo-European word families, sees the connection between *ghos and xénos as “hardly believable.” Frisk writes that the connection is “only possible through a mechanistic and arbitrary dissection.” Chantraine is equally dismissive. Within Indo-European, it is, as Frisk states, “isolated.” Jasanoff and Nussbaum scored a point against me and my mistaken



[CH. 13] SEMITIC SIBILANTS 319
reference to a Mycenaean form kesene-, which is in fact an alternative spelling for “foreign textiles.” They are quite right to claim that the Linear B forms all contain a w, which indicates a stem xenwo- not xeno-.34 They have not, however, taken in the argument, made by Lejeune and Levin, that in early times xi probably represented khs rather than ks, with the consequent articulation of kese etc. In most cultures “foreign” and “foreigners” are usually seen as impure or hostile. For instance, “ to welsh” is an English word for “to cheat,” and the Semitic root ÷gnb is used for “foreigner” in Arabic and “thief ”
in Canaanite and Aramaic. Therefore, the construct infinitive of ÷svn>
“to hate,” sEvno\> “enemy, foe” fits xénos or even the reconstructed *xenwo well in both phonetics and semantics. It would seem to the credit of Greek culture that xén(w)o- developed or retained such hospitable and positive connotations.
6. ÷÷÷÷÷svrp, svårap, svåråp skorpivo" “stinging beast.” The Phoenician form is a reconstruction of the words attested in Hebrew and Aramaic: såvrap “burn” and såvråp “fiery venomous serpent.” Also in this group are skorpivo" skorpíos (5) “scorpion” or rascasse “Mediterranean fish” with poisonous spines (essential for bouillabaisse).35 Both Frisk and Chantraine recognize the word as a loan from a hot country. The correspondence with /sk/ indicates that the word was taken after Phoenician /s2/ -/s/v had merged with /s1/-/s=/. As mentioned above, in Hebrew and Aramaic /s2/-/s/vmerged with /s3/-/s/. Thus, one finds the Greek sevrfo", /suvrfo" (5) “gnat with sharp sting.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine provide an etymology for these. I will discuss the name of the island Seriphos in Chapter 20.36
LATERAL FRICATIVES
While it is possible that Nostratic and Khoisan had lateral fricatives /Ò/, a sound comparable to the Welsh /ll/, Proto-Afroasiatic undoubtedly possessed them.37 Indeed, four variants have been proposed for ProtoChadic.38 To return to Semitic, I should now like to investigate /s2/ and sivn as derived from a Proto-Semitic /Ò/. Modern South Arabic languages still retain /s2/, a reflex of /Ò/. The oversimplified chart given above fails to indicate that, although in general /s2/ came to be pronounced as /s/vin West Semitic, the Arabic letter d≥a\d still represented an emphatic /Ò≥/ well into the First Millennium CE.39 Furthermore, in Hebrew and



320 BLACK ATHENA
Aramaic /s2/ retained its independence as sivn until less than a thousand years before that. In Phoenician, as stated above, it merged into s1-s.= The linguist Richard Steiner has demonstrated that before that in Phoenician and for a longer period in Hebrew and Aramaic s2 -svwas heard by nonSemitic speakers alternatively as /s/, /ls/ or, simply, /l/. The best-known example of the second is the Hebrew båsåvm being rendered as bavlsamon (4) “balsam.”40 Another is the Hebrew Kasdvyîm, the people rendered Kaldu or Kaldû in Assyrian and Caldai'oi in the Septuagint.41
1. *Òph≥, spvh≥ shvpomai, sh'yi", saprov", levpw, leprov" “scab, scale.” The Canaanite root ÷svph≥, later ÷sph≥ means “bark, skin, thin cover, eruption, scab.” Thus the Bible contains the words sapahat “scab,” mispåhåt “long veil,” and sivpha “smite with scab.”42 Greek has a prolific family with similar meanings and their extension “rotten.” For instance, shvpomai (H) is “to make rotten, mortify”; shvy, shvpo" is “poisoned wound” and saprov" “rotten, old.”43 Chantraine states that the etymology is “obscure.” He rejects the attempt to relate it to the Sanskrit kyak–u “mushroom”! A parallel cluster is that around levpw (H) “scale.” These include leprov" “scaly, rough, leprous” and leptov" (repoto in Linear B) “diseased” but also “fine, thin,” said of skin etc. Pokorny, Frisk and Chantraine, with some hesitation, see these as belonging to the IndoEuropean root from which the English “leaf ” derives. The IndoEuropeanist Robert Beekes is not convinced and sees the stem as coming from the substrate.44 While the Indo-European and Semitic sources may have intermingled, given the parallels with rot, disease and scab—as well as the fact that the Canaanite forms began with the fricative lateral sivnI am convinced that these Greek clusters alternating initial /s/and /l/ ultimately derived from a Semitic root ÷/Ò/p(h≥).
2. Òa>, sveh sa, ra leiva, l>(w)m, lavo" “livestock, people.” Orel and Stolbova postulate two Afroasiatic roots *la>-/law- “cattle” and *s[aŒ “cow, bull.”45 Ehret plausibly unites them and reconstructs a ProtoAfroasiatic form *Òo@> “domestic animals,” singular *Òo@>w. He finds this attested usually as “cattle” in Chadic, Cushitic and Semitic.46 In Semitic the /Ò/ appears with both reflexes, the Canaanite, sevh, Arabic s=a>t and Akkadian su>um “sheep, goat.” In Arabic la>at and li>at are words for “cow.” The latter is generally linked to the Hebrew name Le@>ah. There is also the collective Proto



[CH. 13] SEMITIC SIBILANTS 321
Semitic *d≥o>n reflected in the Canaanite s≥o>n “small cattle, goats.” This would seem to derive from an emphatic /Ò¢/ with the ending -n found as a plural marker in a number of Semitic languages.47 Linear B had two signs sa and ra both meaning “sheep, goat.” In Homeric Greek, one finds lhi?", which means either “booty or spoil, mostly cattle” or simply “cattle or stock.” There are many dialectical and other variants, leiva, Ionic lhivh, Doric la/a. On the face of it, such variety would suggest loaning. Nevertheless, Pokorny associated it with a motley group of words, including the Latin lucrum “gain, profit,” the Slav loviti “hunt,” the Old Irish log “reward” and the Gothic laun with the same meaning. Frisk ducks the question and Chantraine, states forthrightly, “no etymology.” In the absence of serious competition, leía would seem to come from *le\>ah.
33333..... ÷÷÷÷÷ l>m, rawo la–ov" “people.” Leía for which Chantraine postulated an original *la– ̧ia as “herd” may plausibly be linked to la– ̧ov". This link is helped by the attestation of the Mycenaean rawa, rawi and rawo, which he joins to reconstruct as *la ̧ov", Lå ós “simple people,” as opposed to chiefs, and “assembled in multitudes.” Thus there are close semantic and phonetic parallels between the two. Låón would seem to come from an extension -m on the Afroasiatic *Òa>/Òaw.48 The Afroasiatic root lüm “big, many” is found in Semitic, West Chadic and Highland East Cushitic.49 In Akkadian, lim is “many”; in Ugaritic l>m and in Hebrew, lE>o[m, mean “people.” The Arabic la>ama means “bring together” but it also means “base, lowly.” With these meanings there are also the forms lu>m, and la>im. The Canaanite consonantal structure is ÷l>m, or ÷l>wm. The possibility that the letter w indicated rounding of the previous consonant was discussed in Chapter 5.50 In this
case, the word can be reconstructed as *la>wom. As Samuel Bochart pointed out in the seventeenth century, the Hebrew
lE>o–m is the probable origin of the Greek la–ov".51 An earlier *la>wo–m provides an excellent phonetic parallel for the accusative la–ovn. There is, of course, no difficulty with the alternation m/n as Greek only tolerated final -s and -n. It is interesting to note that in the Iliad 75 of the 247 occurrences of la\ós are the accusative singular la\ón . A further 78 are in the genitive plural la\ôn. One would not expect so inert a body as the Homeric “people” to be attested in the nominative. Thus, it is no surprise to find only 25 examples of the singular la\ós and 36 of the plural la\oí. What is surprising is how seldom the genitive singular la\oû and



322 BLACK ATHENA
accusative plural la\oûs appear: twice and 13 times, respectively. Even
disregarding these discrepancies *la>wo–m provides a better phonetic basis for an etymology for la\ós than its Indo-European competitors. Frisk proposes a relationship with the Old High German liut “people.” He continues, however, “in contrast to the synonyms dh'mo" and stratov", la—( ̧) ov" which is never properly at home in Ionic and Attic, has no
Indo-Germanic etymology, but is nevertheless an ancient inheritance.”52 Chantraine is not impressed by this curious compromise or convinced by “any of the hypotheses given in the dictionaries.” Furthermore, he is not persuaded by the claim that it derived from the Hittite lah°h°a “war.”
SHELTERED /S/ SC /S/ BEFORE CONSONANTS
1. ÷÷÷÷÷Spd “mourn, wail, smite the breast” speuvdw “zealous” sfovdra “vehement” spodov" “ash.” The last three sections of this chapter will cover words in which the initial s- is unproblematic in Greek because it is immediately followed by another consonant. In Greek a curious group of words has similar sounds but very disparate meanings. These include spodov" (H) “ash,” spodevw (5) “to pound,
beat,” speuvdw (H) and spoudhv (H) “haste, effort, zeal,” sfadavzw (5) and sfuvzw “to agitate, convulse,” spavw (H) “to tear out hair.” From these come the nouns spadwvn (4) and spasmov" (5) “spasms,” ajsfovdeloi (H) “the flowers that cover the meadow of hell” and, finally, sfedanov" (H) and sfovdra (H) “violent, vehement.” Pokorny and Chantraine find cognates for speúdo\and spoudeo\in the Lithuanian spáusti from reconstructed *spáudti with a derived present spáudzi=u “to wipe out, press, hurry.” This linking would seem plausible except the lexicographers are unable to find etymologies for any of the others listed above. These are much more convincingly explained as deriving from a single Semitic root. Although not found elsewhere in Afroasiatic the ÷spd is widely attested in Semitic: sipdu, sapâdu or sipttu in Akkadian, spd in Ugaritic and, with metathesis, as sdf in Amharic. All of these have meanings “to wail, lament, mourning, dirge.” The form is widely attested in various forms in Hebrew, including the construct infinitives sEpôd and lispo\d or lispôd. As in the modern Near East and eastern Mediterranean, mourning was a passionate affair in ancient times. Men, and particularly women, ex



[CH. 13] SEMITIC SIBILANTS 323
pressed themselves loudly without fear or restraint. They pulled out their hair (spáo)\, beat their breasts (spodéo)\, and covered themselves with ashes (spódoi). All were accompanied by spasms, violence and vehemence sphedanós and sphódra.
The alternation d/dr here fits into a pattern widespread in both inherited and borrowed Greek words. In some cases, as mentioned in Chapter 8, the form seems to be the result of borrowings before and after the Egyptian /Å/ lost its liquid value.53 In other cases, such as this one, it probably derived from uncertainty within Afroasiatic in general and Semitic in particular between /d/ and /dr/.54 In any event there is no reason to resort to the mysterious Caland’s “law,” which Alan Nussbaum effectively dismantled in his Ph.D. thesis.55 Frisk and Chantraine agree that asphódelos is a loan from an “unknown origin.” I see it as belonging to this cluster, perhaps meaning “unmourned.”
2. ÷÷÷÷÷Spk sfavzw “sacrifice by letting blood.” A causative /s/ is found throughout Nostratic from Ancient Egyptian to modern English, see “wipe/swipe,” “melt/smelt,” “fall/spill” and even part/split.56 In Canaanite there is a root ÷pkk påkåh “to trickle.” Spk means “to make trickle.” It was used for libations poured onto the ground, frequently with the sense of shedding blood. It is not possible to explain the vocalization with any precision but in Hebrew the infinitive construct is sEpåk. The Greek stem *sphag has many important derivatives. The Linear B sapakterija has been plausibly identified with sfakthriva “sacrificial victims.” The basic meaning of *sphag is “to cut the throat, and let the blood pour out.” Frisk denies the previous etymological proposals and Chantraine states simply “no plausible etymology.”
3. ÷÷÷÷÷S+pl sphvlaion, spevo" “low, deep, cave.” The Greek words sphvlaion (4) and spevo" (H) both mean “cave.” Chantraine argues conventionally that they must be connected “in one fashion or another.” This variation and the absence of any Indo-European etymology indicate a loan and the best candidate is the Semitic ÷spl “low,” found in the Ugaritic shpl “that which is below something” and in the Hebrew s=åpål “low, deep” and, metaphorically, “humiliated.” In addition, s=Epel–åh is the “lowland.” The phonetic match is good and the semantic one passable given the near certainty of a loan.

CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I have tried to untangle some of the complications arising from the shifting nature of Semitic sibilants and their consequences on loans into Greek over the millennia of contact with Semitic speakers. The pattern of borrowings into Greek from the Semitic s=and svis indeed complex, but I hope that I have been able to convey some of the coherence that I am convinced lies behind it.

CHAPTER 14
INTRODUCTION
W
hen I began this project in 1975, I focused exclusively on Semitic loans into Greek, that is to say I was unconcerned with Nostratic, with Semitic loans into PIE or with Egyptian loans into Greek. By the mid-1980s, when I wrote the first drafts of what became Volume 1; I had realized that the first two factors could also explain parallels between West Semitic and Greek. By this time, I believed that some 20 percent of the basic stems in the Greek vocabulary came from West Semitic and an equal number from Ancient Egyptian. Further research made me modify this prediction. While I still maintain the overall figure of 40 percent, I have changed the proportions within it. I now estimate that there are rather fewer Semitic loanssome 15 percent of the Greek vocabulary—while there are more from Egyptian—around 25 percent. It is possible, however, that the numbers are skewed by the many obscure Greek words only attested in Egyptian papyri, thereby introducing local terms. Had more been preserved in the Levant, the proportions might well be better balanced. Another reason that this volume pays rather less attention to Semitic loans is that, unlike the situation with the Egyptian, considerable work has already been carried out on the former. In Chapter 7, I set out a history of the study of Semitic loans into Greek.1 I should reiterate that



326 BLACK ATHENA
over the past forty years Cyrus Gordon, Michael Astour, Saul Levin and John Pairman Brown have carried out excellent research in this area. With few exceptions, however, these scholars have limited their lexical research to the bounds of the third criterion set out by Michel Masson and attributed to Heinrich Lewy: “He threw out of his list, abstract or too broad-ranging nouns, adjectives and verbs.2 While I do consider some of the words for concrete luxury and other items considered appropriate for “Semites,” I see no reason to treat them exhaustively. In general, these etymologies have been established with far more scholarly precision than I could ever muster. Even elsewhere, I have merely followed Professor Levin in examining the words of fundamental syntactic importance, autos and the definite article. In this chapter I shall concentrate precisely on the semantic region that Lewy and Michel Masson considered taboo: “abstract or too broad-ranging nouns, adjectives and verbs,” following the letter order of the Canaanite alphabet: >, b, g, d, h, z, h≥ (h)÷, t, y, k, l, m, n, s, ,J p, s≤, q, r, s,= t.
1. ÷÷÷÷÷b> Baivnw “walk, stand, come, go.” Chantraine takes the orthodox position set out by Benveniste that baino\(H) comes from an IndoEuropean root *gWem-/gWm5 or *gWEE2/gWE2.3 The alternation was
necessary to allow for the presence or absence of the final -ino\of the stem. Seeing it as fundamental allows an association with the IndoEuropean root found in the Gothic qiman and English “come.” However, -ino\is a common suffix and all other tenses indicate a stem be–<ba–, hence the reconstruction of the hypothetical root *gWEE2/gWE2, with only specu
lative Sanskrit associations. Orel and Stolbova reconstruct an Afroasiatic root *ba>-/*baw-/*bay “to walk, go.”4 This is found in every branch of the super-family and almost every Semitic language. In Phoenician it is b>, in Hebrew b(w)>, in the perfect of that language bå>. Thus, in contrast to the confused and contradictory Indo-European etymologies for baino\ the Afroasiatic, through Semitic, is quite straightforward.
2. ÷÷÷÷÷dl(1) Deilov", Dou'lo" “inferior, weak, dependent, slave.” Julius Pokorny accepts the conventional link between dou'lo" Mycenaean doero deilov" “weak, cowardly” and deivdw “I fear” and ultimately duo “two.” Even if one recognizes a relationship between deilo\s and deído\, the proposed Indo-European etymology is highly insecure. Presumably for this reason, Frisk and Chantraine agree that doûlos is a non-Indo-European



[CH. 14] MORE SEMITIC LOANS INTO GREEK 327
loan into Greek. Not surprisingly, they propose, without the slightest evidence, a derivation from Carian or Lydian. Jasanoff and Nussbaum strongly object to my glossing doûlos as “client,” stating that it only meant “born slave.”5 By contrast, Chantraine in his detailed description of the word’s semantics writes, “The uses . . . do not show that the word means ‘slave from birth.’ The word has a general sense and its frequent use on Mycenaean tablets does not provide precise meanings.” Once again, Jasanoff and Nussbaum have succumbed to the Indo-Europeanists’ occupational hazard of misplaced precision. Bomhard proposes a Proto-Nostratic root *duly/*doly “to dangle, hang, swing” attested in Dravidian, PIE and Proto-Afroasiatic. He sees this abundantly attested in Semitic.6 Orel and Stolbova list an Afroasiatic root *dal- “to be weak or tired” found in Omotic, Lowland East Cushitic and, with a double “ll,” in Semitic.7 Whether or not the two roots are related, a plausible link between to two meanings is the sense of “dependent.” The semantic parallel with doûlos “someone in servitude” is quite strong, especially in the absence of an Indo-European competitor. The “primary” meaning given for deilós in most dictionaries is “cowardly,” but even in Hesiod and Homer it is much more frequently used in the distantly related sense of “miserable, wretched, vile, lowborn.”8 The lexicographers’ preference is most easily explained by the fact that the meaning “cowardly” fits better with the verb deído\“I fear” to which Frisk, Chantraine and others (including Jasanoff and Nussbaum) want to attach deilós. The semantics of the more frequent usage favors the Semitic over the Indo-European etymology. Now, turning to the phonetics, Jasanoff and Nussbaum maintain, and I agree, that the initial in doûlos was dw. They go on from that statement, however, to claim the Mycenaean form doero indicates that doûlos derived from a “*do(h)elos (<*doselos?).” The brackets Jasanoff and Nussbaum put around the earlier hypothetical form give a spurious solidity to the unbracketed *do(h)elos. John Chadwick proposed a sequence similar to doelos <(dohelos?) to make a connection with daha,\ “man” in Khotanese (one of the many Iranian languages) and the Sanskrit da\sah, equally “man.” Apart from the semantic looseness, the actual, as opposed to the hypothetical, forms provide no explanation either for the /o/ or “rounding” or for the final /r/l/ in doero/doûlos. Explaining the “rounding” from Semitic also faces difficulties. The existence of a phoneme dwe in the languages represented by Linear B and Linear A is strengthened by a sign for that sound. This, however,



328 BLACK ATHENA
was not used in doero. The presence of rounded velars and labials in Semitic was discussed in Chapter 5.9 The evidence for rounded dentals is less clear, but a possible example can be found in the Hebrew verb ÷h≥tm “to seal, complete.” As regular verbs, in many qal forms the final syllable of  ̇tm “seal” contains a back vowel: imperfect yah≥ta\m, imperative h≥at=a\m or h≥at=ôm etc. H≥tm appears to have derived from the Egyptian ht°m with the same meaning. Nevertheless, the initial h- suggests that of the Greek eJtoi§mo" (H) “ready, sure, certain,” derived from Canaanite rather than Egyptian. As argued in Chapter 5, /oi/ in Greek is an indicator of a rounded consonant in Afroasiatic10 and suggests the existence of rounded dentals in the super-family. Thus, it is quite possible that dl(l) was sometimes rounded. In the basic sense of “hanging, especially in water,” ÷dl is found in the forms dålåh “to draw water” and dElî “bucket.” These meanings involve dangling ropes that could possibly lead to entanglement[?]. Even the name of the entrapping temptress Delilah, would seem to be linked to the Arabic dalal\ “coquetry” and could be derived from ÷dll. Dll would also seem to be reflected in plausible Greek loans with the vowels /o/ and /e/ dolov" (H) “fish trap, trick” with no Indo-European etymology and devlear (H) “fish by bait, trap.”11 Thus, an origin for both doûlos and deilós in a hypothetical Semitic form *dwero would be perfectly plausible. Nevertheless, neither the two Indo-Europeanists nor I have a good explanation for an initial *dw . The reasons for preferring the Semitic etymology for doûlos and deilós are, first, that it provides an excellent semantic fit, while derivation from an Indo-European word for “man” is vague. The second reason is phonetic: the Semitic, unlike the Indo-European, etymology provides an explanation for the /l/. The /l/ and the semantics of the words lead me to believe that deilós with a basic meaning “wretched miserable, low class” should be separated from deído–“fear” and linked to doûlos “slave.”
3. ÷÷÷÷÷zwd yeuvdomai “to be pretentious or false,” ÷÷÷÷÷zwr ywvra “loathsome,” ÷÷÷÷÷zl(l) yavllw “twang.” The transcription of the Greek letter y as /ps/ is generally uncontested.12 Confusion with other sibilants, however, makes the equation less clear. See, for instance, the alternations yhrov"/xhrov" “dry” and ywmov" “morsels of food” and zwmov" “fatty sauce.” I have argued elsewhere that the letter y itself comes from a Semitic /z/ zayin, and that the value /ps/ came from analogy with /x/ xi and the frequency of the Egyptian pÅ+ sibilant.13



[CH. 14] MORE SEMITIC LOANS INTO GREEK 329
Since no clear-cut cases show words with Indo-European roots beginning with psi, one should look for loans. Here the Egyptian pattern pro
vides an important cluster with the straightforward values p+s or p+s=.14 Many words with this initial letter, however, cannot be explained in this way. Some may derive from the Canaanite /z/ as the origin of the letter may suggest. The verb yeuvdomai (H) and the nouns yeu'do" (H) and yudrov" (6) are all concerned with lying and pretentiousness. Although they can go no further in Indo-European, Frisk and Perpillou link it to the Armenian sut “lie” and, therefore, renounce any attempt to see it as deriving from ps. I agree, but see it as coming from the Canaanite zîd, zûd “presumptuous, insolent.” For the alternation d/dr in pseûdos /psudrós see Chapter 13.15
Another example of a Greek word beginning with psi deriving from the Canaanite /z/ is the word ywvra (3) “itch from scab” from the Hebrew zîr, zûr “loathsome of flesh.” Neither Frisk nor Perpillou have an etymology for pso\ra. Another Greek word with initial psi and lacking an Indo-European etymology is yavllw (3) “to pluck the strings of an instrument.” This word first appears in the Septuagint, so not surprisingly it does have a plausible Semitic etymology: the root ÷zll “to shake, agitate.” This form is found in the biblical hapax zalzal “tendril,” “that which is shaken.” Thus, here we have three examples of a correspondence of the Semitic /z/ to the Greek y.
4. H≥ayyîm Ai|ma “life/blood.” As most Americans are aware without knowing it, the Canaanite word for “life” is h≥ayyîm. This appears in Ugaritic and Phoenician as well as biblical Hebrew. In Canaanite, as in other cultures of Semitic speakers, “life” was closely associated with “blood.” One may disagree with the progressivism of the radical nineteenthcentury scholar of religion, Robertson Smith, but there is no reason to challenge his conclusion when he wrote in The Religion of the Semites, “When men cease to eat raw or living flesh, the blood to the exclusion of the solid parts of the body, comes to be regarded as the vehicle of life.”16 For this reason that blood must be offered to the gods and not consumed by humans. Thus, draining blood has always been an essential part of Jewish and Muslim sacrifice and, hence, dietary laws. According to R. B. Onians, the identification of blood with life was shared by the ancient Greeks.17 In Homer haîma has the meanings of



330 BLACK ATHENA
spirit or courage as well as blood. With such close connections between blood and life in both cultures the semantic fit between h≥ayyîm and haîma is very strong. The only possible phonetic objection would be to argue that as the genitive of haíma is haímatos and haimato is sometimes used in compound words, the final -t should be included in the stem. No doubt final consonants that are absent from the nominative but present in other cases can frequently belong to the root. This, however, is not always the case. Few Indo-Europeanists would accept as fundamental the /t/ in dóru/dóratos
“tree”; do\mva/do\mátos “house”; he\pvar/he\pvatos “liver”; ku\ma/ku\matos “wave”; or húdo\r/húdatos “water.” There would seem no reason to except haíma / haímatos from this group. The word has no Indo-European etymology. Chantraine maintains that “there is no common word for blood in Indo-European.”18 By contrast, Frisk suggested that haîma was an outside loan replacing the IndoEuropean root *e–sr, which is represented in Greek by éar. Haîma does not appear in Linear B, but it is well established in Homer. Therefore, I see no reason to rule out a loan in the Bronze Age. When I proposed this etymology in Volume 1, it was endorsed by Gary Rendsburg, who wrote, “A most interesting proposal of Bernal is Greek haima “blood,” as a loan word from Phoenician hayyîm based on the well-known connection in Semitic religion between the two. This is an especially attractive suggestion because the two forms reflect the same diphthong ai/ay.”19 Jasanoff and Nussbaum do not take up the case of hayyîm-haîma.
5. *Kal “female in-law” kall “bride,” ÷÷÷÷÷kålal “complete, perfect,” kal(l)ov" “beautiful.” Orel and Stolbova reconstruct an Afroasiatic root *kal “female in-law”20 found in Semitic, South Cushitic and West Chadic. In Semitic they cite *kall “daughter-in-law” and “bride.” This is only one of two roots, ÷kll, in these languages. The other ÷kll or ÷klh is of “completion” either in the sense of “exhaustion” or that of “perfection.” In the latter sense it becomes confused with kallåh “bride.”
The Aramaic kElila\>vis “crown” as is the Arabic kalil. Akal\il\vis both “crown, wreath” and “wedding ceremony.” In Greek ka–l(l)ov" (H) is “beauty” and the adverb is kalovn or more
frequently kala.v Chantraine, who concludes that the etymology is “unknown,” places great emphasis on a Boiotian kal ̧ov", which he sees as the original form. He cannot, however, explain the frequent doubling or



[CH. 14] MORE SEMITIC LOANS INTO GREEK 331
gemination of the lamda. The digamma is best explained as a “darkened” /l/. The gemination clearly comes from its presence in the Semitic etyma.
6. Kal.ga, H≠alaqa,,,,, h≥ålåq “smooth, bright” calkov" “copper”
hjlevktwr “amber.” In Chapter 4, I mentioned Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s derivation of the PIH root *r(e)udh “red, copper, ore” from the Sumerian urudu.21 One term for “strong copper,” possibly “bronze,” is urudu. kal.ga. Given the interchange between Sumerian and Semitic it is plausible to suppose that kal.ga is related to the Semitic root ÷hl°q “forge.” Orel and Stolbova reconstruct an Afroasiatic root *h°alak/h°aluk “to give birth, create,” but this is largely based on Semitic.22 The chief example is the Arab h°alaqa “to create, shape, mold, forge, fabricate, make smooth.” In Hebrew h≥ålaq means “smooth, slippery and bright stones,” and in an obscure line from Isaiah, the Hiphil participle mah≥al=îq, as a person, is translated in the Septuagint as khalkeús “coppersmith.” Modern commentators translate it as “smoother, smelter, or hammerer.”23 The Eblaite gloss on the Sumerian urudu was kàpálu/kàpáru and the origin of the Latin cuprum etc. from the West Semitic ÷kpr was set out in Chapter 4.24 The Greek word for the metal, however, was calkov" kako in Linear B. Chantraine denies an etymology from kal.ga because it is only an epithet of urudu. He, therefore, proposes that it was a very early borrowing from an undetermined civilization. A form of the Semitic ÷hl°q would seem a plausible bridge between kal.ga and khalkós. The Greek kavlch (6)(calkh)v “murex,” the source of Tyrian purple, indicates that the color of copper and bronze had not rubbed off ÷hl°q. Chantraine sees the metathesis of aspiration and the absence of an IndoEuropean etymology as evidence that it is a loan, of “unknown origin.” Then, there is the word cavlix “pebble, gravel.”25 An early form * h°ålaq or h≥ålaq “smooth stones,” with a vocalization of the known type CåCiC, provides a plausible etymology for khálix. There also appear to be loans from the later Canaanite ÷ ̇lq. First, there is hjlevktwr (H) “brilliant” and h[lektron (H) “alloy of gold and silver, amber.” Chantraine sees -to\r as an Indo-European suffix but cannot find the root. Frisk simply states “unexplained.” Finally, with aspiration there is eJlivkwy (H). Although -o\ps is clearly “eyes,” the meaning of the stem is obscure. The general sense of the word as a whole is “brilliant black eyes.” This provides yet another Greek interpretation of the Semitic root ÷hl°q-÷h≥lq.



332 BLACK ATHENA
7. Lat, Lt≥ Lhvqh, Lhtwv “skin, cover, oblivion, shrouded.” Orel and Stolbova reconstruct an Afroasiatic root *lat “skin” found in Egyptian and West Chadic.26 With an emphatic /t≥/ lt≥ is widely attested in Semitic. In various Gurage languages and Amharic lEt≥ä and lat≥ä mean “bark” of a tree and “to bark” a tree. The Arabic lå>at≥ is “to cleave or stick to a thing, cover with clay.” The Hebrew lå >at≥ is “to cover” and låt≥ or lå>at≥ is “secret, mystery.” Vocalized with /i/, there is the Akkadian litu or letu “covering.” The root also occurred with back vowels as in the Hebrew lôt≥ and lût≥ “to wrap closely, envelope.” Finally there is lot≥ “myrrh, laudanum,” which would seem to have developed from the veiling or shrouding effects of drugs.27 Greek has a similar cluster. The Linear B word rita has been plausibly associated with the Homeric li–v" and li'ta “fine linen,” to cover a corpse. Bérard derived this lîta from lôt≥ but now there is an even closer parallel in litu.28 In Homeric and later Greek a large cluster of words share the stems lath-, lathr- lat\h> let\h-. The most outstanding of these is lhvqh (H) “forgetfulness, oblivion.” Chantraine subsumes this word under lanqavnw—with the present infix -n- “to make forget.” The cluster as a whole covers the semantic themes shroud, escape notice, oblivion, drugs, sleep and death. Suspicion that the group comes from a borrowing rather than from an Indo-European root has been roused by a similar but distinct word lhvto, which, according the lexicographer Hesykhios, meant “hidden.” The name Lhtw,v the divine mother of Apollo and Artemis, clearly came from this root in the sense of “veiled.”29 The only possible non-Hellenic cognate is the Latin lateo\“hide.” There are, however, difficulties with the final dental. The Greek -th- comes from PIE *dh/d, which could also be the origin of -t-. On the other hand, in Latin the *dh became -d-. Frisk, Chantraine, Ernout and Meillet provide complicated ways around the problem. It would be simpler to see both as borrowings from a third language, i.e. Canaanite. In any event, lateo\does not have the druggy associations of le–:the–. MussArnolt and Lewy agreed that the Canaanite lot≥ “myrrh, laudanum” was the origin of the Greek lwtov" (H).30 Chantraine cautiously explains it as a “Mediterranean term of obscure origin.” A careful reader may have noticed that his explanation is often used to avoid attributing a Semitic or Egyptian origin to a Greek word. In this case, however, Chantraine is right, as there is also a plausible Egyptian etymology for lotó–s, which will be discussed in Chapter 15. The Greek word would seem to derive from

a conflation of both the Semitic and the Egyptian sources. Here I shall focus on the Semitic.31 Lot\ós was a name applied to many plants, mainly from Egypt and the Maghreb. The earliest and the most famous reference is the one in the Odyssey to the island of the Lot\ophagoi “lotus-eaters.” No one doubts that their lot\oi were drugs inducing happiness and lethargy. It is striking that in this passage Homer twice uses lot\os in tandem with forms of lanthano\.32 Thus a major Greek lexical cluster, which includes the word for “truth, reality sincerity” ajlhvqeia “not hidden,” has a clear Semitic origin.
8. The ÷lq cluster “gather.” A Semitic biliteral ÷lq has the basic sense “gather.” This meaning goes in three directions: to gather things “to pick, collect, take away”; to gather people “to meet, enumerate” and to pick up ideas “to grasp, understand.” With different third consonants ÷lq covers a vast semantic region. In Akkadian, Aramaic, Syriac and Hebrew ÷lqt`is to “pick up, glean.” In Arabic ÷lqn is to “grasp, understand” and, in the second derived conjugation, “ to teach, dictate.” With various prepositions the Arabic laqiya can mean “to meet, obtain, recite, sing, give a lecture, make a statement on.” In Akkadian and Canaanite låqah≥ is “to take, pick,” “choose” but also “to receive instruction.” The Hebrew derived form leqah≥ is “learning, teaching.” Chantraine describes the basic sense of levgw (H) as “assemble, pick, choose.” From this developed “count, enumerate,” then “tell, speak.” With the vocalization /o/ the root became lovgo" (H) “words, tale, explanation, reason.” The parallels with the basic meanings in Greek and Semitic are striking. Those with the further elaborations are somewhat less so. Nevertheless, the parallels are sufficiently strong to suggest that they did not entirely result from the “internal” Greek developments that Chantraine suggests. Further indications that levgw was borrowed from låqah≥ come from Latin. Lego\in that language has the same basic meanings of “assemble, pick, collect” as levgw and låqah≥. Ernout and Meillet point out, however, the apparent paradox that where levgw is “to speak” lego\is “to read.” The solution lies in a split in the Semitic meanings of “teach” and “dictate.” Dictation, a normal method of education in the ancient world, is both reading and speaking. One reason why Latin emphasized reading is that for speaking the Romans had another borrowing from låqah≥: loquor. Where levgw and lego\



334 BLACK ATHENA
went through a normal transformation of Semitic /q/ and Greek and Latin /g/, Latin, which retained the PIE /qu/, had the ability to render the Semitic quf more accurately and, in this case, did so. Ernout and Meillet remark that just as loquor replaced for, fari (with a strong Indo-European etymology), it was itself replaced by the Christian
term parabola\re. Thus, in both cases a formal word for teaching replaced a word for simple speech. All that Pokorny, Ernout and Meillet and Chantraine can come up with as an etymology for levgw and lego\is the Albanian mb-l’eth, “I pick,” which has an attested palatal g. Ernout and Meillet do not accept any Indo-European etymology for loquor.
9. Nhr Nhvr- “fresh water and sea.” Orel and Stolbova reconstruct a Proto-Afroasiatic root *nihar “flow.” The only non-Semitic example they can find, however, is from the East Chadic language of Mokilko.33 Nevertheless, it—and the substantive nåhår “river stream”—is well established in Asiatic Semitic. The Akkadian nar–u, the Ugaritic nhr, the Aramaic nahrå, Arabic nahara and Hebrew nåhår. The origin of the Latin river name Når, the Umbrian Nahar from nåhår, was discussed above in Chapter 7.34 There is a late word nhrovn (6CE) “water” from which comes the modern Greek nero.v The Semitic ÷nhr was not restricted to fresh water. In the Ugaritic pantheon Tpt Nhr “Judge Nahar” was an alternative name for the wicked sea god Yamm. This name provides a plausible etymon for Nhreuv" (H) god of the sea and his daughters the sea nymphs, the Nhrhi?de".35 Chantraine cites the early twentieth-century scholar Adolph Fick as linking the name to the Lithuanian nérti “dive,” with a long vocalization nèro\vé “water sprites.” Two arguments can be made against this genetic explanation. First, the variations of the spelling Nhrh`de" and Neairhi?de" would suggest a loan. Second, nèro\vé provides an inferior explanation for Ne–reús.
10. ÷÷÷÷÷nwh,°÷÷÷÷÷nwh Naivw, Na–ov" “rest, dwell, dwelling, temple.” As is true for English, the large number of homonyms in Greek are best explained by the number of linguistic sources the language drew upon. The same principle holds for close homonyms. Take for example naío\ “dwell”; na\ós “shrine, temple”; néos “new”; náo\“flow”; naûs “ship”; nóos “perception”; and néo\with the three meanings “swim, spin, heap up.” Inflexion makes the series even more confusing. Of these words, néos “new” and néo\“swim, spin” are clearly Indo-European and náo\“flow”



[CH. 14] MORE SEMITIC LOANS INTO GREEK 335
may well be. Gamkrelize and Ivanov argue that naûs “ship” is a loan from Semitic into PIE. I am more inclined, however, to accept Bomhard and Kerns’ proposal that there was a Nostratic root.36 N(h)evw (H) n(e\)éo\ “pile up” has no Indo-European etymology and would seem to derive from the Egyptian nwi “collect, assemble.” The etymology of nóos “perception” from the Egyptian nw was discussed in Chapter 12.37 This winnowing leaves naío\“dwell” and naó–s “shrine, temple.” An Afroasiatic root *nVwVq “rest” is found in West Chadic and Semitic. Orel and Stolbova postulate a Semitic root *nw found in the Akkadian nâh°u, the Ugaritic nwh,° and the Hebrew nwh≥.38 Nåwåh≥ is to “dwell or abide” and, from a related root ÷nwh, nåweh is a “dwelling.” With generous condescension Jasanoff and Nussbaum write that this word for “temple” is “connected by Bernal—correctly, as it happens—with the verb naío\“I dwell.” They
concede that “neo\svand naío\happen to lack problem-free cognates in the other Indo-European languages.”39 They object to my deriving these Greek words from Semitic because, they maintain, that the words “must” derive from a root *nas or stem *naswos. Here again Jasanoff and Nussbaum and their predecessors have been trapped by the reification of their own imaginary constructs. No such forms are actually attested and the variety of dialect forms can equally well or better be explained as resulting from loans. Gary Rendsburg has pointed out that in Hebrew not only does nåwåh≥ mean “dwell, abide” and naweh “dwelling, abode,” but also naweh is used with the specialized meaning “temple, shrine.”40 With excellent semantic and phonetic correspondences of the Semitic etymology for Na–ós, Neo–:s, and naío\and no Indo-European competitor, it is perverse to prefer a purely hypothetical construction.

11. ÷÷÷÷÷pŒl poŒêl, Poievw “do, make” ÷÷÷÷÷pŒm, Paivw, Pauvw “beat, stop.” Frisk and Chantraine agree that poievw (H) “to do, make” originally had a medial digamma *poi ̧ o and that it derives from an Indo
European root *kwei, which is attested with a nasal in the Sanskrit cinóti “to pile up, arrange.” It would be fair to describe this conclusion as farfetched in both phonetics and semantics. On the latter level, it is much simpler to derive it from the standard Phoenician, although less-frequent Hebrew, verb påŒal “to do, make.” The vocalic structure o-e in poiéo\corresponds exactly with the shape of the Canaanite present active participle. In this case, poŒêl, which was frequently used verbally, although not as much as in later Hebrew where it has become the normal present



336 BLACK ATHENA
tense. The consonantal correspondence has two minor problems. First, there is the lack of /l/ in the Greek forms. The “darkening” or velarization of /l/, however, is an extremely common phenomenon in many languages.41 A second difficulty comes from the reconstructed digamma in *poi ̧ oVV. This too could be equally well or better explained as the reflex of an Afroasiatic Œayin. The equivalence of Œayin and w was discussed in Chapter 10.42 The same principle holds with the verbs paivw (5) and pauvw (H). The early twentieth-century grammarian of Greek E. Schwyzer attempted to link the two on the basis of a reconstruction of paío\as *pawío–. He saw paúo\as a back formation of the aorist and future forms of *pawío–. He had no problem with the semantic differences between the two, seeing them both as coming from “striking someone to keep them away.”43 Chantraine describes this damningly as “an ingenious hypothesis.” I do not believe, however, that it should be dismissed so easily. The semantic match between paío\and p‘m, the Canaanite for “to strike, beat” is exact and, to follow Schwyzer’s argument, that with paúo\not far off. The phonetic difficulty is with the final -m in the Canaanite verb. /M/ appears in grammatical positions in the “middle” paúomai and the passive participle paiómenos in the Greek verbs. Thus, it could well be that the /-m/ was seen as morphological and was, therefore, dropped from the stem. The lexicographers do not have an Indo-European etymology for either verb.
12. Qds Ku'do", Kudrov", Kedrov" “apart, sacred, vile, sacred tree.” One of the best known Semitic roots is ÷qds, in later Canaanite, ÷qds “apart, sacred, vile.” Greek has a large cluster around ku'do" (H) and kudro" (H) with the same meanings of both “divine glory” and “vile.” The final -s of early Canaanite was taken into Greek as the marker of a type of neuter noun, in which all cases of the singular except the dative end in -s. The adoption of kûdos into the neuter gender, nonexistent in Afroasiatic, is an example of the importance of morphological determination of gender in the recipient language and the insignificance of a word’s gender in the original language.44 Rendsburg has pointed out the strength of the phonetic parallel showing that “the Hebrew qo\des= ‘holy’ is a u-class segholate whose proto-form can be reconstructed as *quds.”45 Thus we have an excellent semantic and phonetic match. Jasanoff and Nussbaum follow a conventional claim that kudos has a “perfectly good IE etymology: it is cognate with the Old Church Slavonic çudo (gen. çudese) “wonder, marvel.”46 Here, in their eagerness to have a go



[CH. 14] MORE SEMITIC LOANS INTO GREEK 337
at me, Jasanoff and Nussbaum tripped over themselves, since they previously insisted that “there is nothing essentially ‘sacred’ or ‘holy’ about the Greek word.” By contrast, Chantraine insists on the divine aspect of the word and agrees that “the sense leads one to the Old Church Slavonic çudo . . . however, the Slav word would suppose a vocalism *qeu [not found in the Greek kudos].”47 Chantraine then turns to even less-likely IndoEuropean etymologies. The Semitic alternation between holy and vile in ÷qds would seem to be reflected in kuvdo" “insult” and kudavzomai (5) “to insult.” Pokorny, Frisk and Chantraine, however, maintain that this verb was unrelated to kûdos and that it derives from a root found in the Slav cognate kuditi “cry, mockery.” There may well have been confusion here but given the Semitic ambiguity it seems likely that both sources were at play in this case. The alternation ku'"do"/Kudrov", like that between yeuvdo" and yudrov", was discussed in Black Athena Writes Back.48 With -dr and different vocalizations, there are a number of related Greek words and names. Kovdro", legendary king of Athens, worshipped as a hero in classical times and the sacred kevdro" (4) “juniper, later cedar.” The temple at Jerusalem was erected under Phoenician supervision and was built of cedar. There is no reason to suppose that other Canaanite temples were constructed differently. The long-lasting timbers of the temple of Melqart at Cadiz, described by the Roman writer Silius Italicus, were almost certainly of the same material.49 The likelihood that ÷qds was used to refer to cedars is increased by the Egyptian word qdtt, which Faulkner describes as “a conifer? from Syria.” The Syrian cedar was also known in Greek kedrelavth (1CE). On its own jelavth (H) means “pine.” Frisk and Chantraine can find no satisfactory Indo-European etymology for it.50 A derivation from the Canaanite and Phoenician form *>el\at = Hebrew >el\åh, “lofty tree, terebinth” is far more probable.51
13. ÷÷÷÷÷Qal, qôl, qåhal “speak, assemble” bouvlh, bouvlomai “assemble, desire.” Orel and Stolbova postulate an Afroasiatic root *qal-/ *qawal “speak,” which in Semitic they relate to *qa–l “voice.” In Arabic qa–la (qaul) “speak” usually refers to social situations: teach, advocate, confer, parley, wrangle, argue etc. There are two apparently related roots in Hebrew. First is qôl “sound,” usually applied to the human voice, sounds of animals, music and so forth but also of articulate speech, advice command. The second is qåhal “assemble” and the noun qåhål “assembly,” specially convoked for political or religious purposes. The semantic



338 BLACK ATHENA
connection between qôl, and qåhål is analogous to that between parler and parliament.
Turning to phonetics, the alternation in Semitic between ÷qwl and
÷qhl or qol and qal indicates earlier forms with a labiovelar *qwal. Many Greek words are based on the stem bouvl-. The most important are bouvlomai “desire” and bouvlh “assembly, council.” No one doubts that they are related. The question is which was primary? The lexicographers assume it is from boulomai to boule\. Chantraine is, however, unable to set out a clear semantic passage in this direction. It is rather easier to go from boule\to boulomai. Boule\has the senses of “decision, council and counsel.” Chantraine points out that there are many derivatives around bouvlh in the sense of advice, notably bouleuvw “consult, deliberate and propose, determine” which comes close to “desire.” Take, for instance, the verse from the Iliad: “Arkhelokhos, for him the gods [bouvleusan] destruction.”52 The conventional translation is “proposed,” but the collective decision could be rendered “desired.” Thus it seems more likely that the semantic flow was from boule\to boulomai. Boulomai is often paired with ejqevlw (H) “to want, desire.” Chantraine distinguishes between the two, seeing boulomai as more active and ethelo\as the passive “being inclined to, accept.” This idea fits an origin for boulomai from boule\as “collective decisions.” Ethelo\has no Indo-European etymology but, despite the inability to explain the prothetic e-, a plausible Egyptian one could be from tr “respect, greet respectfully.”
Chantraine maintains that an initial labiovelar *gwel or *gwol is “certain.” Given the uncertainty about the voicing of the Semitic emphatics,
an early derivation of the Greek boule\<*gwol from the West Semitic *qwal “call together, assembly” would seem plausible.
14. Qsm kovsmo" “divination, arrangement.” This etymology was sketched out in Chapter 8.53 As stated there, the basic meaning of the Greek stem kosm- is “to order, arrange” especially by a god or other figure of authority. In the passive it can mean “to be assigned.” Though not attested in Linear B, kovsmo" and the verb kosmevw “to set in order” are well established in Homer. Agamemnon and Menelaos were kosmetore lao\n “commanders of people.”54 In connection with Pythagoras, kósmos was used as “order of the world, universe.” Chantraine dismisses Frisk’s various proposals and writes that the “least improbable connection” is with the Latin censeo\“to make a solemn declaration” and the Sanskrit



[CH. 14] MORE SEMITIC LOANS INTO GREEK 339
çám≥sati “he recites.” Aside from the semantic difficulties, the phonetics have both vocalic and consonantal problems. The Semitic root ÷qsm has a basic meaning “to cut, break, divide, allocate.” The Arabic qasama is “to divide, assign, especially of a deity.” In the tenth stem it is “to cast lots, seek an oracle. “In Early South Arabic mqs1m is an “oracular decision.” The Hebrew verb qåsam was “to practice divination,” qesem and miqsåm mean “divination” or “magic.” Given the evidence from Arabic, rejecting a meaning of “assign” in the Canaanite verb ÷qsm does not seem reasonable.55 The Greek vocalization does not provide a major obstacle as we know that a pattern Co/ uCC existed in Ugaritic.56 Thus, both the phonetic and the semantic distances between ÷qsm and kosm- i are far shorter than those between kosm- and censeo\or çám≥sati.
CONCLUSION
As I wrote at the beginning of this chapter, I have tried to avoid ground covered before by scholars with far greater expertise than mine. Therefore, I have avoided examining the Semitic origins for terms regarding luxuries and trade goods. Instead, I have looked at such fundamentals as blood and bronze and such centrally important verbs as baino\“to go”; lego\“to speak”; poieo\“to make”; and naío\“to live” and at such religious and philosophical terms as kalos, kudos and kosmos. The point of this and the preceding chapter is to claim that Semitic influences on the Greek language and, hence, Greek civilization as a whole cannot be restricted to what the stereotypical Jews of the past could have provided. Rather, we should consider what they did, in fact, contribute.

SOME EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC
CLUSTERS IN GREEK
CHAPTER 15
P
revious chapters have been largely concerned with phonology, that is attempts to find systematic phonetic parallels among Egyptian, Semitic and Greek words or roots. In this and the next three chapters the focus will be on meaning. As mentioned in Chapter 14, previous scholars have set out well various loans from Semitic into Greek, although they have largely restricted their investigations to concrete nouns.1 The list of Greek words with Egyptian etymologies has been far more exiguous. Apart from the work of Peter Viktorovitch Jernstadt and Constantin Daniel in eastern Europe, proposals of borrowings from Egyptian have generally been restricted to the obviously exotic.2 Therefore, before considering verbal clusters in other semantic regions, it would be useful to examine probable or possible Greek borrowings from Egyptian of some practical items and processes in civil life: agriculture, cooking and medicine. Other areas, such as music, textiles and metallurgy, could equally well have been included, but the aim here is demonstrate by providing substantial examples rather than through completeness. In each section of this chapter, Egyptian words will be ordered according to the Egyptological “alphabet,” already set out near the beginning of Chapter 9: Å, i, Ô, w, b, p, f, m, n, r, h, h≥, h,° h, s, s,= q, k g, t, t, d, d. This ordering will also be used in the next three chapters.



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 341
NATURE AND AGRICULTURE
The etymologies claimed in this section are subdivided into seven categories: marshes, reeds and pastures; trees and fruit; cultivation; cereals; animal livestock; birds; and, finally, agricultural implements and containers.
Marshes, reeds and pastures
Given the size and the wealth of the Nile Delta and the relative lack of wetlands in Greece it is not surprising that so many Greek terms for water plants should derive from Egyptian. Greek derivations from the Egyptian root Åh°“new growth” when the /Å/ was pronounced as a liquid, will be discussed further on in this chapter under lavceia and lavcnh. At this point I am concerned with later forms. Åh°r, only attested in Demotic and the Coptic ahre “marsh, reeds,” is generally accepted as being the source of the Hebrew >ahu < *>ah°u “reeds, rushes.” It is found in the Greek a[cura (H) “straw, chaff, bran,” and a[cwr (4) is “skin disease, scurf.” With the shift /r/>/n/ ajcnh (H) “bran, powder foam,” and ajcai?nh" (4) “young deer with velvet on his antlers” belong to the same cluster.” A jcavlion is a plant name associated with “marsh mallow, medicinal herb.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine provides an etymology for any of these. ˆÅqt “vegetable” appears in the Greek a[rako" (4) “wild chickling” a legume. Chantraine describes the etymology as unknown, although he considers the possibility that it comes from Asia Minor. The Egyptian ˆdb “land along a river bank,” provides a strong etymology for e[dafo" (H) “bottom, base, land, soil.” Chantraine views the structure of the word as “singular” and tentatively associates it with hédos “seat.” He is unable to explain what he sees as the suffix, -aphos. The Greek a[vron (4) is a plant name applied to many species. Pliny referred to an Egyptian arum and on this ground Hemmerdinger accepted an etymology from the Late Egyptian Œrw “reed.”3 Pierce denied this on the grounds that áron was nothing like a reed. In so doing, he disregarded the vagueness of the term and the number of species it referred to.4 The etymological link between the English “green” and “growing,” shows that in many languages “green” is as much a process as a nominal modifier or adjective. This is certainly the case in Ancient Egyptian. In



342 BLACK ATHENA
Chapter 9, I demonstrated the relationship between Aphrodite and Pr
wÅdyt.5 The root wÅd, written with a lotus and a snake, e (M14) means “green, make green, flourish.” The Greek a[rdw (5) is “to water the ground,” by a river or artificially. Chantraine proposes an initial  ̧ - but suggests no etymology. The fourth lemma in Chantraine’s treatment of ijov" (4), adjectival ijwvdh", is “verdigris, the greening of bronze, rust.” Chantraine links it to iós “poison.” He finds an Indo-European root attested in the Latin virus.
However, iós ioo\dve\s “make green” is semantically closer to the Egyptian wÅd.
Despite phonetic difficulties beyond those I have normally tolerated, wh≥Åt, Demotic whi, Coptic uahe “cauldron, oasis” is universally admitted to be the etymon of the Greek o[asi" (5) “oasis.” The very probable, but unattested, form *pÅ s=Å “marsh, field, meadow” provides a good etymology for pivsea (H) “water meadow.” Frisk describes this word as “without a sure etymology” and Chantraine calls it “obscure.” The form *pÅ sÅ would also explain the place name Pivsa that is applied to two marshy regions and their cities in Elis in the northwest Peloponnese and in Tuscany. Mnh≥ “reed, papyrus” provides a plausible origin for the Greek mnavsion, a Nile plant. Chantraine gives no etymology. In Chapter 10, mr “canal” was mentioned in connection with mr “libation trough” and the mythical spring Mélia.6 The phonetic biliteral
K (U6) mr “hoe” appears as a symbolic tool cutting a canal on the famous mace head of the Scorpion Pharaoh at the beginning of a united Egypt. Mr belongs to an Afroasiatic root *mar “hoe” also found in Semitic, East Chadic and Highland East Cushitic, linked to another root *mar “dig.”7 “Canal” provides a good origin for ajmavra “canal.” Frisk and Chantraine suggest two etymologies for this. The first is to connect it to a verb ex-ajmavw (H) “to open a channel” and possibly to a[mh “shovel, water bucket.” Besides associating it with amára, neither Frisk nor Chantraine has an etymology for áme\. On a semantic level a derivation from mr would explain the apparently incongruous set of meanings for áme\. Before the development of the shadouf, or pole and bucket lever, in the New Kingdom, Egyptian irrigation and the raising of water depended on manual buckets.8 A man holding a basket or bucket can be seen on the well-known Scorpion mace head. The likelihood of the mr “channel, pond,” having had a prothetic



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 343
aleph is increased first by such a sound found in what appears to be a Chadic cognate but, more powerfully, by the Coptic forms eme (S) and ame, áme\\(B).9 Not surprisingly, as in so many cases, the Bohairic, or northern, Coptic form is closer to the Greek. The Coptologist Eugene Dévaud saw the Coptic ame as derived from mr.10 Both C+erny and Vycichl, however, derive it from the Greek áme\without considering that word’s lack of an etymology. At this point we should turn to Frisk and Chantraine’s second etymology for amára. They associate it with the Hittite amiyar “canal” and to see it as a term for an “oriental technique.” This explanation is extremely plausible, but the general topography of central Anatolia made irrigation there less prominent than it was in either Egypt or Mesopotamia. The Hittite and Greek terms could derive from the Akkadian marru “hoe” with an extended meaning “channel, canal.” More likely, they came from Egyptian forms *amar “canal” and the tools needed to construct it. On the principle of substitution of Greek /ph/ for Egyptian /m/ discussed in Chapter 8, another possible loan from Egyptian mr in the sense of “artificial lake” is freva–r “well, cistern.” Frisk and Chantraine link phréa\r to a reconstructed Indo-European root *bhre-ew- found in the Germanic *brunn “spring, bourne” the Scottish burn. They both point out, however, that phréa\r is unique in referring to still, as opposed to running, water. The suggested etymologies of leimwvn “meadow” and limnhv “lake” from *r-ˆmn “pasture, marsh” have been discussed above.11 The Middle Egyptian rd, rwd/d Coptic rot\ (SBA) or rot or lot\ (F) meant “hard, strong, plant, grow, flourish, prosper, shoot of a tree, health in bones and limbs.” All of these are written with the phonetic rwd or
rwd { (T12) “bow string, cord.” In Greek there is a cluster rJadinov" (H)
rJodanov" or rJodalov" “supple, slender, lively.” This is used to refer to “straps, vegetation and then the human body.” rJodavnh is “the thread used in weaving.” Chantraine has no problem with the suffixes -inos and -anos, but he is puzzled by alternation of vowels in the stem. (This seems to me to be a good indication of a loan.) He, even more strongly than Frisk, finds all previous attempts at constructing an etymology unsatisfactory. The Greek Ôravdamno" (3) and ojrovdamno" (4) “branch twig, sprout” could also derive from rd, rwd/d. On the other hand, it could come from Rdmt “a plant, cypress grass.” Chantraine sees a possible relationship



344 BLACK ATHENA
with the Latin radix “root.” He and Frisk admit, however, that these terms are considerably confused. In Chapter 14 I referred to the Semitic etymology for the Greek lwtov" proposed by Muss-Arnolt and Lewy and accepted by Boissacq and Pauly Wissowa.12 Constantin Daniel has powerfully challenged this view; he argues that the Greek word comes from the Coptic rot\ or lot\.13 He quotes Herodotos, who wrote “they gather water lillies [krínea see above] which they call lot\ós.”14 Alan Lloyd, who accepts a Semitic origin for lot\ós, states that in this case, among many others, Herodotos had fallen into the “type of error . . . common in Gk writers.” Lloyd does not mention the Egyptian or Coptic words.15 Daniel’s second witness comes from six centuries later; Athenaios, who lived in Naucratis on the Nile in the third century CE, wrote in his “Banquet of the Sophists”: “The Egyptians call it lotus.”16 While the Coptic rot\ or lot\ merely meant “plant,” the word is spe
cifically associated with lotus in the determinative used for rd P (M32) which Gardiner describes as “stylized rhizome of a lotus.” Therefore, in this case, as in many others, I do not believe that modern Besserwisserei, should so easily be used to dismiss the testimony of ancient writers. To conclude, as I wrote in the last chapter, I believe that the Greek lot\ós derives from a conflation of the Egyptian and West Semitic sources. Cwvra: The plausible derivation of kho\ra “space, country as opposed to town,” from the Egyptian s=Å originally *h°r was discussed in Chapter
8.17
Gardiner described the sign w (M12) hÅ° as “leaf, stalk and rhizome of lotus.” The plural hÅ°w meant “plants, flowers or lotus flowers.” This provides a plausible etymology for clovh (5) “new green plants.” Perpillou proposes an Indo-European root *ghel. He admits, however, that no other example has a zero grade. Some apparent cognates of khlóe\notably clwrov" (H) “the green or clear yellow of plants,” have a second liquid. These may be explained by confusion with another Egyptian word h≥rrt “flower” Demotic h≥rry.18 This word has many Afroasiatic cognates, including Berber alili, Cushitic ilili “flowers.” There is also a Hittite word alil. The Afroasiatic terms with Coptic hlel\i (F), hre\re can also explain the origin of leivrion (4) and the Latin lilium “lily, narcissus.” W. H. Worrell and B. Hemmerdinger see the Coptic etymology for the Latin and Greek terms respectively.19
Richard Holton Pierce denies this on the grounds that a form ajlhlwv cited by Hemmerdinger “is not an uncontestable transcription of h≥rrt and bears no clear relationship to leivrion.” He continues: “Moreover



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 345
h≥rrt was throughout its history a general term for flower, rather than a specific designation for any particular plant.”20 This statement is comparable to denying a relationship between the general German Tier “animal” and the particular English “deer”! Frisk and Chantraine cautiously see leírion as coming from the eastern Mediterranean. Emilia Masson concedes that it may be Semitic.21 HÅ°w nw ss=n “lotus flower” may also be the origin of krivnon (5) “lily.” The late term kalamov-krinon “reed resembling a lily” suggests the possibility of a lotus. Frisk and Chantraine provide no etymology and suppose that krínon is a loan. H/HÅ°t “marsh” clearly belongs to the same cluster. This provides a good etymon for ci–lov" “fodder, pasture.” Neither Frisk nor Perpillou suggests an etymology for this word. Phonetically, this etymology is very close to my proposal that ci–vlioi “thousand” derived from the Egyptian HÅ° “thousand.”22 H/H°Åt “marsh” may well provide one etymology for covrto" (H). In Homer it meant “courtyard, the perimeter of the horizon, meadow.” In this sense it appears to belong to an Indo-European root found in the Latin hortus, the Teutonic gards etc. In Hesiod and later writers, however, it is used to signify “meadow, space with plants” and above all “fodder, hay, grass.” Thus the Indo-European and Egyptian roots appear together to have given the word its wide range of meanings.
Sm(w) Coptic sim “plants” was often written with t (M20) “reeds growing side by side.” One spelling of smyt also “plants,” Coptic sme, is
with the determinative _ (M2) “plants, frequently reeds.” Another smyt
without that determinative meant “edge, mat.”23 Both Frisk and Chantraine are happy to discuss the common suffix -ak in savmax (5) “reeds, mat of reeds.” They are, however, unable to explain the root. In the 1880s Wiedemann proposed the derivation of the Greek savri (4) “Egyptian water plant” from the Late Egyptian sŒr “thicket, papyrus-like-plant.”24 It is now generally accepted that sŒr was a loan from the Semitic s=Œr “barley field, scrub country or thicket.”25 Theophrastos’ specific mention of Egypt suggests that the name was taken from there rather than from the Levant.26 The uncertainty of the Semitic sibilant sivn may explain the Boharic sari, which Walter Crum, the lexicographer of Coptic, relates to the Greek sári. Chantraine subsumes sári under sivsaron “parsnip?” but accepts no etymology for either. One indication of the ideological constraints on lexicographers can be seen from the differential attitudes towards two meanings of the same



346 BLACK ATHENA
Egyptian root ss=n “lotus” and ss=nw “ropes, cordage.” Generally, sou'son “lily” is accepted as an “oriental” loan, passing from Egyptian to Canaanite and on to Greek. On the other hand, Chantraine describes sou'son “ships’ cordage” as “without an etymology.”27
The hieroglyphic biliteral sign s=n @ (V7) is “a loop of cord that hangs
downwards.” As mentioned in Chapter 13, it occurs in the word s=nw “net, enclosure, circuit, circumference.” This word, in turn, provides a plausible etymology for the Greek scoi'no" kono “reed, cord, measure of land.”28 Chantraine simply states: “A plant name without etymology.” A later borrowing of s=nw together with s=nŒ “breast” provides an origin for the Latin verb sinuo or noun sinus a “a concave fold in cloth, breast.” Ernout and Meillet sum these up as “without etymology.” A common Late Egyptian word for “reed” is qmÅ, Demotic qm, qmÅ and Coptic kam, a metathesis qÅm has been attested.29 The latter provides a plausible etymon for the Greek kavlamo" (6) “reed, straw” (and later “pen”).30 Chantraine sets out an Indo-European root in the Latin culmus, the Old High German halam etc. “straw.” He points out, however, that the Greek vocalization kala- is “isolated.” It is difficult to decide which is the more likely but, given the closer semantics—reeds not straw—and the vocalization with /a/, the Egyptian etymology appears preferable. Daniel argues plausibly that the Egyptian qm, Coptic kam, provides a clear etymology for kavmax (H) “prop, pole, stem.” He argues that as this is attested in Homer it is older than the accepted Semitic etymology of kánna “reed” mentioned in Chapter 7.31 Daniel points out an Egyptian parallel in kamax. Herakles’ third labor was to behead the many-headed Hydra from which, whenever it was beheaded, many others sprang up. A number of the other labors involved marshes or hydraulic engineering.32 This fact gives some credence to the euhemarist interpretation of Servius, the commentator on Virgil, who claimed that the Hydra (water) represented a delta where whenever a channel was blocked a new one or new ones broke through.33 The pattern revealed in the myth and its interpretation explains a group of apparently wildly incongruous words: Dn is “to chop off, behead.” Dnˆ is a cluster of words associated with irrigation.
The basic meaning is signified by the determinative # (V11) “to block
or dam water.” This involves channeling; dnit,jte\ne in Coptic, is a “dike, ditch, canal.” With appropriately different determinatives dnˆt is “bowl, basket” used to raise water to higher levels before the introduction of the



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 347
shadouf in the Eighteenth Dynasty.34 Dnijwithout the damming determinative is to “allot, share out,” presumably this allotment was initially of water.35 In this sense it is cognate, either genetically or through loaning from Egyptian, to the Semitic root ÷d>n “judge, adjudicate.” Dnyt is a “land register” and this, or Dnˆt/te–ne, provides a good etymology for dhvnea (H) “plans, designs.” Chantraine dismisses both of the previous etymologies for this word. Yet another word in the Egyptian cluster is dnˆt “festival.” This presumably is connected to distribution. qoivnh (H) is a “festival following a
sacrifice.” Despite Chantraine’s reconstruction of an original *qwi-nathis too appears to be derived from dnˆt. There is no Indo-European competitor.
Bushes, trees and fruit
Fewer Egyptian names for trees and their fruit than for marsh plants found their way into Greek. Nevertheless, the number is still impressive. In this case, too, the vocabulary generally applies to fruit cultivated earlier and more extensively in Egypt than in Greece, such as dates and figs. Interestingly, however, a number of these terms have extremely widespread extended meanings. Chantraine, Ernout and Meillet all recognizes the similarity between the Greek ijxov" “mistletoe or glue used to lime birds” and the Latin viscum “mistletoe or glue.” They are, however, unable to see how the connection can be made. The simplest explanation is that they are both borrowings from a third language. The explanation can be plausibly seen in the Egyptian ˆs= “saliva.” The Egyptian bÅq “moringa or tamarisk tree” and its oil appears to be the origin of the Greek murivkh (H) “tamarisk tree.” Chantraine sensibly rejects Lewy’s etymology from the Semitic ÷mrr or “myrrh” but provides no alternative. The Late Egyptian bŒˆ, the Coptic baei (S) bai (B), is “a palm branch stripped of its leaves.” Chantraine derives bai–v" (3) “palm leaf ” from this word.
Bny/Bnrt “dates, fruit, sweet.” Egyptologists and linguists have long puzzled over a confusing tangle of words beginning with bn. Apart from (1) bni/bny “date,” there are (2) bwn “double spear point,” (3) bnbn “point aloft, become erect,” “pyramidion [the point on top of pyramid],”



348 BLACK ATHENA
(4) bnt Coptic boine “harp,” (5) bnt “fruit or compote,” (6) bnw “phoenix,” (7) bnwt “secretion, wound or blood.” No one doubts that bnt, boine “harp” is the etymon of the Greek foi'nix (4) “a type of lute.” The Coptic forms are boine (s) and ouoine (B). Unless
influenced by Greek, these indicate an earlier *bwa/EnEt. To turn now to bni/bny/bnrt, the consonantal structure of this word is debated. The lexicographer Raymond Faulkner assumed that the earliest form was bnrt, which later developed into bnit and bny “date, fruit.” Semitic words for dates based on bnr seem to support this idea. The majority of more recent scholars, however, see bnrt as a hypocorrection of bni.36 Orel and Stolbova do not provide an Afroasiatic root for this and Takács argues that the Proto-Berber form *b-y-n “date” is not a genetic cognate but a loan from Egyptian.37 Many of the Berber words contain a /y/; only the cognate Guanche term for “figs,” te-haune-nen, has an internal /w/. Thus, from the Afroasiatic end evidence for a rounded /bw/ is difficult to find. On the other hand, it would fit the form and reconstruction *boine which is found in the Greek foi'nix (3) “date tree.” At this point we should note that the color of fresh dates is crimson. Thus *boine “date,” would fit with what lexicographers see as the primary meaning of phoînix, ponikia in Linear B: “red, purple.”38 Taillardat, continuing Chantraine’s dictionary, sees this phoînix as a suffix -ix on a root found in foinov" (H) “blood red.” Phoinós itself he derives from a Indo-European root *bhen “beat to death,” although, rather puzzlingly, he emphatically denies that this word has any connection with fovno" (H). In any event, meaning 7 “secretion, wound, blood” is a more direct Egyptian candidate.”39 Herodotos explicitly states that “the [Egyptian] name of the sacred bird is foi'nix (5) “Phoenix” clearly deriving it from the Egyptian name Bnw.40 It is possible that phoînix, in this sense, appears in the Linear B form ponike. The early twentieth-century Egyptologists Sethe and Spiegelberg and many later scholars, using an unusual Late Egyptian spelling bynÅ and the analogy with boine “harp,” plausibly reconstructed the sacred bird too as *boine.41 Naturally so obvious a conclusion had to be challenged by skeptics.42 To some extent, the image of the phoenix rising from the ashes can be associated with the flamingos rising from the salt lakes of east Africa and as their medieval Latin name—derived from “flame”—suggests, they are pinkish and scarlet in color. None of the derivations of bn can directly explain foi'nix (2)



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 349
“Phoenician.” The only possible connection is the cumbersome one through the tentative connection bny “date” with crimson to the “purple dye” for which the Phoenicians were famous. There are two other clues concerning the ethnic name. The first is the Egyptian Fnh°w the name of a Syrian people that looks remarkably like phoinik-. Nevertheless, even if they can be identified, the likelihood is that the Egyptian name was taken from the people themselves or their, probably, Semitic-speaking, neighbors. The local name, however, was KnŒn, KEnaŒan in Hebrew rendered in the Akkadian of the Amarna Texts as Kinah°hi° or Kinah°na/i. Kinah°h°u also meant “purple.” Astour argues that this word came from the land of Kinah°hi°.43 Thus the common assumption that phoînix “red, purple,” and Phoînix “Phoenician” are linked could come from a Semitic calque. On the other hand, the conventional belief that in the Greek case the name of the people phoînix came from that of the color phoînix would fit if the latter derived from phoînix “date.”44 This seems more likely than the final possibility: that Kinah°na was originally *Kwinah°na and taken as such, like the name Gwebla, into Greek before the breakdown of labiovelars. Thus becoming *pEnah°hi° and the Mycenaean ponikia. The need for two hypothetical forms makes this explanation far too cumbersome. To return to the base of this section: Given the analogies from boine “harp” and boine “phoenix,” there is little doubt that bnˆ is the origin of phoînix “date.”
MÅmÅ “Doum palm used for nuts and fiber” is almost certainly the etymon of mevrmi–" (H) “cord, rope.” Interestingly, Chantraine sees it as a “broken reduplication” but concludes that the etymology is “obscure.” On semantic grounds nqŒwt “notched sycamore figs” provides an excellent correspondence with the Cretan nikuvleon (2) “type of fig” about which Chantraine writes “possibly Aegean.” The match is sufficiently strong to overcome the phonetic difficulty of the final -l. James Hoch sees the reconstructed Egyptian form *alhamma\n as a borrowing from the Semitic ÷rmn “fruit,” or more specifically “pomegranate.” He sees the Akkadian armannu as the most likely source of the Egyptian form.45 With the article pÅ, *pÅ Œnrmn, or Coptic *p (h)erman, provides a good etymon for prouvmnh (4) “plum tree.” Chantraine sees it as a loan probably from Asia Minor. The obvious etymology s=n bnrt, Coptic senbeni /sbbeni “hair of the date palm” sebevnion sebénion (2) “date palm fiber” was seen by Jablonsky



350 BLACK ATHENA
in the early nineteenth century and Wiedmann in the 1880s.46 Frisk does not list sebénion and Chantraine does not refer to its etymology. HÅ°nnt “type of date palm” and the Late Egyptian h°Ånn “kernels” provide a good etymology for the Greek kavruon (5) “nut” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine can find an etymology for this word. The latter is not impressed by Pokorny’s attempt to derive it from *qar “hard.” In the case of Sevseli or sivli “type of Egyptian tree,” Chantraine agrees that the plant is Egyptian and that the word is “foreign.” He does not put the two together, however. Despite the semantic distance srd and ssrd “to plant trees” would seem to match well.
Stafulhv (H) “bunch of grapes” appears to derive from a salesman’s pitch, “choice, select, excellent” originally from the Egyptian stp “choose, choice, select, choicest, excellent.” This verb is a causative s—makewith tp “head” or “best.”47 The phonetic problem with a loan into Greek is that the Coptic forms are sot\p (S) and sotp (B) in which a vowel comes
between the first and second consonants. The final –yle\vis also unexplained. Nevertheless, the idea that a form *stVp existed is strengthened by the number of Greek words with such a structure and semantically linked by the sense “choice, best.” All these words lack Indo-European etymologies.
Staphule\vitself does not merely mean bunch of grapes. Homer uses the word to signify “level, standard,” which increases the plausibility of the etymology proposed above.48 Furthermore, Chantraine admits that
it is “easiest,” to see staphyle\vas a loan. He sees Ajstafiv" (ojstafiv") and
variant of jstafiv" “raisin” as related to staphyle\v. The variants themselves indicate borrowings. Stevfo (H) is “garland, honor, crown” with the extension stevfano" and the related stevmma (H)(sacred) “garland.” Chantraine sees the semantic connection among these words as being “circuit,” but he has no explanation for it. It is reasonable to consider this sense as secondary. Finally, there are sti'fo" (6) “ a group of [picked?] men, often military, pressed together” and stifrov"(5) “strong and sturdy.” Chantraine related this to a Balto-Slav root stieb “mast, pillar, stick.” Given the otherwise unexplained cluster it seems more plausible to prefer an Afroasiatic etymology. Qwqw “doum palm nut” has two Greek derivatives. The first kou'ki (1CE) “doum palm nut” is accepted by all specialist authorities and even Frisk and Chantraine admit that it is a possible loan from Egyptian.49 The second likely derivative is kovkko" (5) “kernel, grain, seed of pome



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 351
granate.” Frisk suggests it is a “Mediterranean loan”; Chantraine says it is unknown. The words kÅm(w) “vineyard, grape harvest, vintner” and kÅny “vintner” have been discussed at length in Chapter 8.50 For the Egyptian cultivation of grapes and wine, see the short survey by Jean Hani.51 Herodotos states explicitly that the Egyptian name for castor oil was kiki.52 Despite certain complications as to precisely which vegetable oil is meant, the identification of this oil with the Egyptian kÅkÅ has been universally accepted.53 None of these scholars have linked this word to khkiv" “oozing liquid” and the verb khkivw “ooze” (H). This form is used to refer to resin, blood, fat of sacrifices etc. It would seem appropriate, however, to derive these from viscous, fatty castor oil. Neither Frisk nor Chantraine have found a satisfactory etymology for this. The Egyptian dÅbw “figs, foliage” and Late Egyptian dbÅw “leaves” together provide a plausible etymology for qrivon (4) “fig leaf.” The weakness of medial or final -b has been discussed in Chapter 9.54 Chantraine is suspicious of Pokorny’s Indo-European etymology for thríon. Frisk sees it as “Mediterranean.” In Chapter 10, I proposed a derivation of terébinthos from *dÅb ntr “sacred fig.”55 With metathesis of liquids, dbÅw “leaves” also provides an etymology for tuvbari" “a Dorian salad.” The only problem here is that because of the consonantal /Å/ this loan necessitates an early borrowing, while nearly all Dorian borrowings from Egyptian appear to have been made in the First Millennium. The Egyptian dqrw is “fruit.” Orel and Stolbova find no Afroasiatic root for this. Either as a cognate or as a loan, however, it is clearly related to the Semitic ÷dql. David Cohen saw this as meaning “date of inferior quality,” linking it to Ethiopic forms indicating inferiority. Most scholars, however, interpret the Arabic daqal as “dates of superior quality.”56 In any event, no one questions the association with dates. In the nineteenth century, Lagarde and Lewy proposed a reconstructed form *daql on the basis of the Aramic diqlå and the post-biblical segholate form deqel. They saw *daql as the etymon for a special meaning of the Greek davktulo" (4) “type of dates.”57 Muss-Arnolt contested this interpretation but offered no alternative.58 Frisk and Chantraine were sympathetic to the Semitic etymology, although they believed that the form had been influenced by dáktylos in its usual sense of “finger.” Frisk suggested that “the folk etymology was built around the resemblance between the leaves of the date palm and the outspread fingers.” I see the resemblance as much closer to the strings of dates themselves. Neither Frisk nor Chantraine



352 BLACK ATHENA
provides an etymology for dáktylos “finger.” They are not convinced by Pokorny’s attempt to link it to the Gothic tekan “touch” or the Old Icelandic taka “take.”59 In this situation it seems legitimate to ask whether dáktyloi “dates,” for which there is a plausible etymology, could be the origin of dáktyloi “fingers,” which lacks one. The possibility of a link between clusters of fruit and clusters of fingers can be seen in the English “hand” of bananas. Furthermore, apparently absurd “slang” etymologies do occur. For instance, there is no more plausible origin for sarkofavgo" than “eater of flesh.” In Late Latin testa “tile” replaced caput “head,” and equus “horse” was superseded by the slang caballus. This, as Saul Levin has shown, was derived from the Canaanite gåmål “camel.”60 Ernout and Meillet see the Latin camel–us as coming from the Greek kavmhlo". Even so, they cite the Roman grammarian Varro as having written that the word came from Syria to Latium.61 The /a/ in caballus makes a derivation from kámelo–s less likely than one directly from a Canaanite dialect, probably Punic. All in all, *daql- dáktyloi “dates” could well be the origin of dáktyloi “fingers.” Chantraine devotes a third section to Dáktyloi. These are sometimes giant and sometimes dwarfish figures famous for their power and smithcraft. Chantraine maintains that these Dáktyloi have nothing to do with the meanings of the word. However, it is striking that they are associated with [Ida, a name shared by two dominant mountains, one in Crete and the other in the Troad. Both Frisk and Chantraine view it as a “Pre-Hellenic word without etymology.” There is, as Astour has demonstrated, a plausible etymon in the Semitic ÷yd idu in Akkadian, yåd in Hebrew and yEdå in Aramaic. The basic meaning is “hand,” but in Canaanite it can also mean “monument, phallus, power,” all possible etyma for the name of a mountain. Given the many Semitic place-names in Crete, ÷yd provides a plausible origin for Ida.62 Naturally, a derivation from “hand” is strengthened by the presence of dependent Dáktyloi “fingers” around the two Idas.
Cultivation
Although Greek agriculture, dating back to 6000 BCE, is probably as old as that in the Nile Valley, the number of plausible Egyptian etymologies for Greek words concerning arable crops and cultivated land is not surprising. Many of the examples given here in fact linked to the wild and



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 353
domesticated fertility of the Nile Delta. The reasons for the number of probable loans in this semantic area seem to be, first, at least since the Late Bronze Age, Egypt was seen as the “breadbasket” of the eastern Mediterranean. Second, many of the terms in this section have religious significance and can, therefore, belong within the context of the cultural role of Egyptian religion in the formation of Greece. The Egyptian root ÷Åh°has many meanings, nearly all of them positive. With different spellings Åht° can mean “inundation season, papyrus, thicket, arable land.”63 This double meaning fits lavceia, the mysterious epithet for an uninhabited and wooded, yet well-watered and potentially rich island found in the Odyssey.64 In addition, Åh° provides a reasonable etymology for the, otherwise unexplained, Greek verbal cluster around lacaivnw (H) “cultivate vegetables.” Chapter 21 contains a general discussion of the ramifications in Greek of the related Egyptian roots wÅg and wÅd “growth, swelling, festival.” At this point, I should just like to consider one instance, the word ojrgav" (5) “well-watered land, often sacred.” The orgás was a stretch of land near the sacred oracular center of Eleusis with its close Egyptian connections.65 The orgás was otherwise known as the Rharian Plain, famous for its fertility and supposed to be the first place cultivated by Demeter.66 It was also supposed to alternate between sterility and fertility with the subterranean imprisonment of Persephone.67 Rharian has a clearly Egyptian origin from a reduplication of Åh,° Åh°Åh°“to grow green.” Also Åh°Åh°provides a reasonable etymology for lavcnh (H) “new growth.” Generally interpreted as “hair, fleece,” this word is also used to describe “new foliage.” Chantraine supports Benveniste’s construction of a hypothetical root *wli ≈k-sn-a\to link lákhne\to Slav and Iranian words for “fur” or “ hair”—var ́sa and vlasú. Pokorny constructs a root *ue÷l “wool, hair” with two derivative branches: one with a final gutteral to which lákhne\ belongs; the other with a final dental to which the Germanic wald belongs. According to Pokorny, lavsio" (H) “hairy, furry leafy” fits in this class.68 As there is no trace of an original  ̧ “w” in any of the Greek words with the stems lakh- or las-, it would be simpler to postulate two borrowings from Ancient Egyptian. The first would have taken place when the sign was a uvular /h°/ and the second when it had merged with /s=/. The problem with this scheme is that /Å/ is generally assumed to have lost its consonantal force some centuries before the merger of /h°/ and /s=/. If this is correct, the semantic similarities between the two



354 BLACK ATHENA
clusters must be the result of coincidence and the lás- group is unlikely to derive from Egyptian. Therefore, this group remains unexplained. In any event, Åh°remains the least bad etymology for lakh. In 1953 Petr Viktorovitch Jernstedt proposed deriving the Greek ejrusi–vbh “verdegris, rust in plants” from the Coptic erse\be “rust in plants.”69 Neither Çerny nor Vycichl mention this proposal in their dictionaries. Chantraine associated it with the Indo-European root *rudhso “red,” although he is puzzled by the rare suffix -be.70 The Egyptian rnpwt “herbs, vegetables,” rpy in Demotic and (e)rpoin Coptic, provides a convincing etymology for rJavfano" (3) (rJavfu", rJavpu"). This was an Attic word for “cabbage, radish.” Frisk and Chantraine argue that similar forms in other Indo-European languages are probably loans from Greek. Thus, rháphanos does not derive from an Indo-European root. S+spt, also ss=pt, in Late Egyptian “cucumber,” provides a plausible origin for the Greek sisumvbrion (4) “watercress” for which Chantraine gives no etymology. QÅbt, was “breast (male or female)” in Middle Egyptian. In Late Egyptian qbyt signified “breast” or more precisely “nipple.” The Greek kuvamo" (H) “bean,” kuvamo" Aijguvptio", was a “pink water lily.” According to Plutarch, it was also “the extremity of the breast which swelled at puberty.”71 The resemblance between beans and nipples may well have been one reason for the Pythagorean abstinence from beans. Aristotle, in fact, explained the taboo: “because they are like the genitals.”72 Chantraine tends to accept the conventional view that kúamos is a loan, although he also considers Frisk’s view that it derives from kuevw “to become pregnant, swell.” This view conflates the Indo-European and Egyptian sources.
Proto-Afroasiatic apparently had a root *qwad found in South Cushitic and Chadic and meaning “calabash.”73 From this developed Chadic and Egyptian words for “pot,” qd in the latter. In Egyptian the root developed in two different directions. On the one hand, “to pot” (kot\ in Coptic) was extended to “to form, build, create” and from that to “creation, nature.” On the other hand, making a pot by coiling, walking round it and, later, throwing on a wheel was qd and qdi :: kto, kato, kot\ e (S) and kot\ i (B) and came to mean “go round, encircle, circumference.” This latter sense is reflected in loans into Greek. Kwvdwn (5) “embouchure of trumpet,” and the trumpet “used to signal rounds of inspection.” Chantraine relates this to kwvduia (4) “fruit of Nile, water lily” and “Egyp



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 355
tian bean” and to kwvdeia (H) “garlic, onion or poppy bulb.” Apart from relating them, he provides no etymology for the cluster. The image of garlic as wheel also occurs in other Greek terms for “garlic”: a[gli" (4) and gevlgi" (4). Frisk and Chantraine fail to find an etymology for these too. It would seem to come from gilgål, galgal, West Semitic words for “wheel, circle, ball.”
Cereals
Given the importance of Egyptian grains to the Aegean, it is not surprising to find many Greek words in this semantic sphere with plausible Egyptian etymologies. The derivation of ajqhvr “pointed ear of wheat” ajqavrh “soup made from wheat flour” from ntr and the absence of an Indo-European etymology were discussed in Chapter 10.74 Ajqavrh will also be mentioned later in this chapter. Plausibly ˆmÅ “gentle and kind” can be seen as the origin of the Greek ajmalov" (H) “tender, feeble.” Also, imÅ as “well disposed, gracious [of goddess]” and imÅyt, an epiclesis of Hathor, provide an etymology for
the Greek iJmaliav “abundance of grain,” an epithet of Demeter. Neither Frisk nor Chantraine offer an explanation for this epithet. ∆jAmariva and ∆Amavrio", epicleses for Athena and Zeus in Achaea, have varied forms, such as Jomavrion, which suggests a loan. Chantraine, however, follows the scholars who arbitrarily link Amariva and jAmavrio" to jamarth~ (H) and Jamartevw “to attend, bring together,” They construct this from Jama + jararivskw, which is alleged to be the source of jarqmov" “link, union, friendship.” This implausible chain seems less likely than deriving Jamarth~, and Jamartevw from the Egyptian smÅ “unite,” smÅt “union” and smÅyt “association, confederacy.” This would have happened when /Å/ still had consonantal value and before the Greek shift initial s>h.75 In a note in Volume 1, I considered the possibility that the Greek term ejteovkriqo" “really barley” was part loan and part calque from the Egyptian phrase ˆt m ˆt “really barley.”76 The etymologies of the
Greek kri–qhv “barley” ci'dron “fresh grain” and kavcru" “grilled barley” from the Egyptian s=rt “kind of grain” and s=rit “barley” were referred to in Chapter 8.77 The Egyptian ŒwÅy has two distinct but related meanings written with different determinatives: “harvest” and “to rob, pillage.” A number



356 BLACK ATHENA
of derivatives exist in Greek. Chantraine’s third entry for ou\lo" (H) is “destroyer,” an epithet for Ares. Without understanding how, he sees this as related to o[llu—mi (H) “to lose, destroy, perish.” He sees this as based on a radical *ol but admits no plausible relationship can be found outside Greek. Despite the difficulty with the double /l/, the two are very plausibly explained as separate borrowings from ŒwÅy. The connection is made still tighter by Chantraine’s fourth entry for oul\o": both “sheaf ” and a song in honor of Demeter, goddess of the harvest. Chantraine relates this to ijoulov" (H) “first down, catkins, sheaf of corn” and ijoulwv
or Oujlwv goddess of the sheaves or Demeter. The double parallel of destruction and harvest found in both ŒwÅy and oulos makes the derivation of the Greek cluster from the Egyptian virtually certain. Chantraine follows Frisk and Boisacq in an attempt to link both oulos and ioulos to ou\lo" “wool.” Contamination from this root may have influenced the meanings of “first down” or “catkins” but could hardly have affected “sheaves.” Chantraine gives two entries for ajkthv (H). The first is a precipitous slope. He derives it from the widely used hypothetical PIE root ajk in a special sense. The second lemma for akte\ is that used as a formula Dhmhvtero" ajkthvn, associated with the cult of Demeter and assumed to mean the “flour” of corn or barley. In Hesiod’s Works and Days, however, it is associated with Demeter, winnowing and a threshing floor.78 For Chantraine, the etymology of akte\ in this sense is unknown. The two meanings can be reconciled by considering the Egyptian ht°yw. The basic
meaning is “platform.” Written with i (O40) it was “terraced hillside” as in Sinai and Lebanon. Otherwise, it meant “threshing floor.” While these Greek words have many different meanings, stavcu" (4) has even more: “ear of corn, plants, shoot of a plant, star, bandage round the abdomen.” Fick, Frisk and Chantraine relate it to an Indo-European root, *stengh “sharp, sting.” This does not begin to explain the full semantic range, but an etymology from the Egyptian s=dwh°/h°w does. The basic meaning of this is “embalm.” It was used in the rituals around the symbolic burial of Osiris in the month of Khoiak. In the Eighteenth Dynasty it was “the custom to make a figure of Osiris as a mummy from a linen bag which was stuffed with corn. If this was watered, the corn sprouted through the meshes of the bag so that the god was seen to grow.”79 The derivation of sivto" sito “wheat” either from the Egyptian swt or the Sumerian zid “wheat” or from both was discussed in Volume 2.80



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 357
Livestock
Most domestic animals in Ancient Greece had Indo-European names. Nevertheless, a number had supplementary terms, which cannot be explained in this way. Many of these “extra” words can be plausibly explained as having derived from Egyptian or Semitic. Although not listed as an Afroasiatic root by Orel and Stolbova, an interesting semantic cluster collects around the Egyptian triliteral ˆbÅ.
The Egyptian biliteral ˆb determinative ‹ (E8*) belongs to an Afroasiatic root for “kid” also found in Beja and West Chadic.81 The implications of “frisky” are apparent in the lengthened ˆbÅ “dance” and with the nominal suffix -w in ˆbÅw “barbary sheep.” With a medical determinative, ˆbÅ is thought to be “laudanum.”82 As a goat, ˆbÅw appears to be reflected in the Greek ajipovlo" (H) “goat”83 and e[pero" (6) “ram.” Chantraine explains the first as ai[x, aijgov" “goat” dropping the final -g with a slightly puzzling suffix and éperos as ejpi + ei'ro" “who carries wool.” Also, ˆbÅ “dance” appears to be the origin of hjpivalo" (6) “shiver, fever.” Chantraine views with sympathetic skepticism a derivation from h[pio" “sweet, benign.” Thus, “benign fever”! Also, ˆbÅ provides an etymology for the suffix -mbo". This occurs in i[ambo" “verse, satire” and in jIavmbh, the person who made Demeter laugh. Chantraine sees this as a possible loan. Then there are i[qumbo", di–quvrambo" and qrivambo"all songs and dances used in the cult of Dionysos. Chantraine links them all to íambos for which he has no etymology.
In addition, ˆbÅ or ˆbr, the Late Egyptian ybr written with _ (M2)
“plant, unknown drug,” appears in one meaning of ai\ra (4) as “poisonous intoxicating herb in the wheat,” “darnel,” which causes those affected to dance wildly. The Latin e\brius “drunk,” for which Ernout and Meillet can find no satisfactory etymology, also seems to derive from ybr. The vulgar Latin ebriaca and the French ivraie preserved the original sense of ergot or darnel. Ivraie also provides a plausible origin for the English “ivy” which is supposed to have the same effect. A phrase from a pop song of the 1940s: “and little lambs eat ivy, a kid ‘ll eat ivy too, wouldn’t you?” brings us full circle.84 The Egyptian ˆdr was a general collective: “herd” of cattle or elephants, “flock, gaggle” of geese. Despite the distinction between >aleph and the Œayin, or even g ́ayin, this term may well be related to the Hebrew Œe\der and the Aramaic Œadrå “flock, herd.”85 The Greek ajqrovo" (H) “crowd,



358 BLACK ATHENA
squeezed, assembly” has no plausible Indo-European etymology. Frisk and Chantraine are skeptical of the idea that it belonged to a word family whose only other member is the Sanskrit sadhry-añc- “united.”86 Either the Semitic or the Egyptian etymology is preferable. Although the Semitic form is closer phonetically, some connection with Egypt is suggested by what appears to be a calque between the Greek ajllovqroo" “speaking another language” and the phrase ky ˆdr “another herd” used by the Middle Kingdom “factional” (fictional and factual) figure Sinuhe to refer to himself as an Egyptian in Syria.87 As does English, Greek has many words for pigs. The uJ~ and su'" probably—as Chantraine suggests—was borrowed from an IndoEuropean language that retained the initial s-. Despite the Ancient Egyptian suspicion of pigs, it may well be that a number of the other similar Greek terms come from Egyptian. Rri, Coptic rir with variants raare and raire “pig” provides an etymology for the Alexandrian term e[rrao" (2) “boar, ram.” According to the ancient lexicographer Hesykhios, [Erro" was an epithet of Zeus. In Chapter 8, I discussed the many correspondences between the Egyptian /s=/, originally /h°/, and the Greek /kh/. In the light of this correspondence and that between /Å/ and /r/l/, the Egyptian s=Å “pig” may well be the origin of the Greek coi'ro" (H).88 According to Frisk, no “unobjectionable” etymology exists for this word. He sets up two mutually exclusive hypotheses. One is a root *ghor-yo “bristly or hairy beast.” The other is to link it to the Armenian ger “fat.” Because of doubts about the initial, Chantraine prefers the first explanation. Neither Frisk nor Pokorny, who proposes a root *g§hers, relate these to the Old Norse gríss “young pig.”89 On the other hand, sivalo" sia2ro “fat pig,” for which
Chantraine can find no etymology, could well be a later borrowing from ßÅ. If this is the case, it shows, once again, that the Greek shift s>h antedated the Egyptian loss of the consonantal value of /Å/. In Chapter 8, I discussed the origin of the Greek ethnos from the Egyptian tnˆ/w “census, numbering of crops and herds.”90 This provides a good etymology for the main portion of eujqenew (5) “flourishing of flocks.” After some hesitation, Chantraine reconstructs a PIE root *dhe, which he finds in the Latin fe\nus “interest on capital,” because wealth was originally seen in terms of cattle. Ernout and Meillet do not mention this possibility. For sÅ “cattle hobble” seirav “cord, lasso, line,” Chantraine is skeptical about all the proposed Indo-European etymologies.



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 359
Birds
There are relatively few examples of bird-related forms but those that do exist show the presence of Egyptian words in this semantic region supplementing those from Indo-European. To begin with, *Œqw “cormorants” provides a strong etymology for kauvax (H) “sea bird.” The -ax is the standard suffix for animals and birds and is found, for instance, in iJevrax “hawk.” In Chapter 9, I discussed the derivation of the Greek aujchvn “neck of men or animals” and aujcenivzw “break the neck of a victim” as being from ws=n, “wring the neck of poultry.” In that same chapter, I also discussed *pÅ sÅb “dappled, multi-colored plumage” as the origin of yavr (H) “starling, speckled.”91 There is a common Afroasiatic root *pVr “jump, fly.”92 Orel and Stolbova also postulate a root *paŒur “dove,” examples of which they find in West and Central Chadic. They also include Egyptian pŒrt.93 The Chadic cognates ensure that, although pŒrt is only first attested in Late Egyptian, it must have existed earlier. The Coptic forms are pe\re (S) and pe\ri (B). On this basis, Vycichl reconstructs a form *peÅ Œet or *perŒet “quail, pigeon.” These words provide a plausible etymology for the Greek pevleia (H) “pigeon.” Chantraine sees this word as deriving from the bird’s color peliov", pelidnov" and poliov".94 The actual color represented by these terms is uncertain. It appears to have included “gray,” “off white” and “blue.” These, as Chantraine suggests, are very appropriate for doves or quails. Apart from seeing the three color terms as related, he provides no etymology for them. All in all, the color terms more likely derived from the birds, rather than the other way around, and péleia, as well as paleuvw (5) “to act as a [bird] decoy,” derived from the Egyptian pŒrt. The Coptic word papoi “little bird, chick, hen” has a precedent in the Demotic ppy “young bird.” This word provides an etymology for the Greek favy-pabov" (5) “pigeon, dove.” The uncertainty of the initial suggests a loan. Chantraine sees pháps-pabós as a variant of favssa /favtta with approximately the same meaning. The phonetics are simply too far apart. As I discussed in Chapter 5, the alternation -ss-/-tt- is often an indication of the Semitic tsadeh.95 In this case, there is a post-biblical Hebrew word patshån “finch” that derives from Biblical ÷ptsh “to break out,” specifically in shouting and song. Thus pháps/pabós and phássa/phássa come from two different roots in two different Afroasiatic languages.



360 BLACK ATHENA
MÅŒ z (H1) “pintail duck” provides a plausible etymology for the first
element in meleagriv" (4) “African guinea fowl.” Both Chantraine and Frisk assume it is a loan word. HÅw was an undetermined species of wild fowl. The Greek oujriva (2) was a type of duck. Chantraine describes the etymology of this word as “obscure.” The Egyptian earth god Gb(b) was identified as gb “goose.” In Hellenistic times Gbb was transcribed into Greek as Kh'b. Thus Gbb provides a good etymology for kevpfo" (4) “stupid bird,” possibly a petrel. Chantraine is interested in the gemmination but can provide no etymology. The Middle and Late Egyptian gmt “black ibis” shifted in meaning to become Demotic kymy and Coptic çaime “hen.” C+erny, Vycichl and Liddle and Scott all accept that this is the origin of the Greek kaivmion (4CE) “chicken.”96 Neither Frisk nor Chantraine include a lemma for this word. Trp “edible bird” provides a good etymology for qraupiv" (4) “small bird.” Chantraine does not give an etymology.
Implements and containers
The significant number of examples of this section suggests either that new Egyptian agricultural technology was introduced into Greece or that Egyptian terminology in this area was added to the existing native words or replaced them altogether. Orel and Stolbova postulate an Afroasiatic root *wurVm “roof.” They base this on a West Chadic form *wurVm “cover, thatch” and the Egyptian wrmwt “awnings, roofing,”97 The word’s determinative of a sharply pointed roof is not contained in the Gardiner list. Vycichl sees the Coptic ualme or uolme “something to let” as coming from wlm. A number of important Greek borrowings apparently come from this. Before discussing these, however, we must consider two agricultural terms. The first is wjlevn(h) (3) “matting or shelter used to bind or cover bricks.” (This is not to be confused with wjlevn(h) “elbow,” which has a clearly IndoEuropean etymology.) The second term is o[linoi, a Cypriot term for “sheaves of barley.” In Chapter 8, I examined and gave examples of plausible etymologies in which an Egyptian /m/ was rendered as /ph/ in Greek.98 The
Greek o[rofo" (H) meant “roof, made of reeds” and ojrofh v(H) “roof.” These have been associated with the verb ejrevfw (5) “to roof.” Here



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 361
there is a semantic identity with wrm and the vocalization of the earlier attested nouns To turn now to more wide-ranging terms: oujranov", wjranov" in Doric and o[rano" in Lesbian meant “vault of heaven,” seen as made of bronze, iron or crystal. The personification of heaven, the god Oujranov", Uranos, comes from this. Aristotle used ouranós as “vault” to describe the palate of the mouth, or a “tent” or “pavilion.” Frisk and Chantraine rejecton strong phonetic grounds—the tempting link ouranós to the Sanskrit Varun≥a, the early Hindu god of the sky. The phonetic bounds of loaning being less stringent than those of genetic relationships, wrmwt provides a more plausible etymon.99 [Olumpo" (H) or Ou[lumpo" is the name of various mountains in Greece, notably the one in Thessaly believed to be home of the gods. Chantraine believes that as a toponym it could simply be a Pelasgian word for “mountain.” Of course, this is possible, but the semantic similarity with Ouranós, with which, as Martin Nilsson observed, Olympos is frequently paired, offers a reason for preferring derivation from wrmwt.100 In one passage from the Iliad the two are contrasted: Ouranós is in the sphere of Zeus; Olympos is part of neutral territory.101 Elsewhere, however, the two mountains are presented as parallel. For instance, in Book 1 of the Iliad Athena visited Achilles “from heaven” (oujranovqen) but 25 lines later returned to Olympos (oujlumpovnde). Later still in that book, Thetis goes up to mevgan oujranovn ou[lumpovn te as the same place.102 In Book 15 of the Odyssey, Zeus thundered from the two peaks alternately in the same passage.103 The same parallelism occurs in some oaths. Finally, there is the mention in Sophokles’ Oedipus Tyrannus to [Olumpo" ajpeivrwn “boundless Olympus.” Most translators simply omit the line in which the reference occurs, especially since it also contains other puzzles. Nevertheless, the Italian scholar Salvatore Quasimodo rendered Olympos as cielo “heaven,” thus increasing the ambiguity between ólympos and ouranós.104
The Egyptian sÅ is written with the determinatives fi (V17), accord
ing to Gardiner a “rolled up herdsman’s shelter of papyrus,” and 4
(V16) undoubtedly a “hobble.” It meant “protection, amulet.” The hypothetical *pÅ sÅ provides a plausible etymology for yavlion and yalovn pasaro in Linear B. The words’ meanings are not certain but they include “curb, chain for a horse, harness and open U-shaped ring.” From this, the term extended to “arch” and “vault and drain.” The first determinative



362 BLACK ATHENA
would also seem to be represented by yaliv" (2CE). Perpillou describes this glyph as “scissors, made from a single blade bent into a rounded U.” Neither Frisk nor Perpillou see a sure etymology for this cluster. The derivation of pivqo" “large wine jar” from *pÅ th°“ beer jug” was considered in Chapter 9.105 In 1967 Constantine Daniel proposed deriving the Greek ma–vnh" (3) “a type of cup” from the Egyptian mn, mni later mnt “jar, measure of beer.”106 A further possible loan is ajmnivon (H) “vase to receive the blood of sacrifice.” Chantraine denies any connection to ajmnov" (5) “lamb, “ and he has no etymology for amníon. The avoidance of initial double consonants by adding prothetic vowels was discussed in Chapter 5.107 A further loan from mn- is mwvi>on (2) “box, jar.” The omega in this indicates that it is a later borrowing than ma–vnh" after, rather than before, the Egyptian shift a\>o.\ For this shift, see Chapter 5.108 The derivation of mevlh “sort of cup” from mr was discussed in Chapter 10.109 Mr “milk jar,” the Coptic maris, provides an excellent etymology for the Greek mavri" (4), a liquid measure consisting of six kotuvlai. The possible, but hypothetical form, *r-qn(i) “mat, basket” provides one origin for livknon (H) “winnowing basket, cradle.” Chantraine follows Pokorny who, basing himself on the metatheses nei'klon and nivklon, related it to the Lithuanian niekóju “winnow.” Either or both would provide plausible etymologies for líknon. Frisk and Chantraine subsume líknon under likmavw (H) “to winnow, destroy.” In Middle Egyptian the word qmÅw has been tentatively explained as “winnower,” with the personal suffix -w. This interpretation was based on context and the common Egyptian word qmÅ “reed” and things made with reeds, like mats and baskets. This is discussed in this chapter.110 Thus, here again it would seem legitimate to hypothesize a Coptic form *ˆrˆ qmÅ *r ́-kam “make winnow” as the origin of likmáo\-. The derivation of nevmw “nomad, pastoral, to distribute or allocate grazing land” leading to “law” from the Egyptian nmˆ “to travel” and nmˆw “bedouin, herdsman,” was discussed in Chapter 12.111
The Egyptian plural form hŒ°w had a wide range of meanings, varying from “weapons” to “funeral furniture” “ships’ tackle” to “utensils.” They could all be put under the heading of equipment. In Late Egyptian the form is also attested in the specific sense of “basket, bucket.” The phonetic shifts of the signs conventionally rendered /s=/ and /h°/ were described in Chapter 8.112 Almost certainly, at some stage Greek



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 363
speakers would have heard it as /sk/. The Greek skeu'o" (5) was as
wide-ranging as hŒ°w. Chantraine summarizes: “recipient, utensil; above all in the plural skeuvh utensils of all sorts in the house, culture, navigation, cases, equipment, objects.” H°bbt “type of jar” provides a suitable origin for skuvfo" (H) “jar, jug” used by peasants for milk etc. Chantraine provides no etymology. The Middle and Late Egyptian h°nr has a range of meanings around the concept of restraint: “prison, harem” but also “reins, restraint.” In Coptic the central sense shifted to harem and marriage, and the phonetics to s=eleet (SA) and s=elet (B). According to Vycichl, the vocalization is uncertain because of internal borrowing between dialects. According to Frisk, the Greek cali–nov" (H) “reins, anchor” is related to the Sanskrit khalina- “bit.” Chantraine, however, points out that the great lexicographer of Ancient Indian, Manfred Mayrhofer, maintains that the Indian word is a borrowing from the Greek. Therefore, Chantraine sees the etymology of khali\nós as “uncertain,” probably a loan. The Egyptian word provides the origin.
SÅw “wall” © (Aa18) in Late Egyptian is sÅwy, sÅwt “property” sirov"
(5) “silo, granary.” Chantraine states “no etymology.” Another source of sirós may be from Semitic, attested in the Akkadian saru cycle of 3600; it was transcribed into Greek as savro" or sarov". A Canaanite form of this may be the source of swrov" (H) “heap of wheat, heap” (swreuvw “accumulate” and swrei'a “arithmetic progression”). Chantraine has no etymology for any of these words. Kavbo" “measure of wheat” is generally thought to be a transcription of the Hebrew qab “measure of capacity” because it first appears in the Septuagint. Frisk and Chantraine, however, point out that the ancient interpretation of the word kavbaiso" “glutton”—attested from the fourth century—as kavbo" and aij'sa indicates that the former might well be older. In this case, kábos could come either from the Canaanite or from the Egyptian qby Coptic kabi or ke\bi “jar, measure.”113 From the point of view of semantics, qrh≥t “pointed ceramic vessel, or basket” provides a plausible origin for the Greek krwssov" (5) “water jug, funerary urn.” Because of the /ss/ and the practicality of the object, both Frisk and Chantraine are inclined to reject theories that it is cognate with the Irish croccan and the Anglo-Saxon crocca. They prefer a Mediterranean origin. The /h≥/ might explain the long vowel and the final /-t/ often rendered /-is/ in Greek, the sibilant. Nevertheless, the derivation of kro\ssos from qrh≥t can only be described as reasonable or plausible.



364 BLACK ATHENA
The stronger derivation of kavlaqo" from Qrh≥t or krh≥t will be discussed in Chapter 18.
The Afroasiatic root *qwad and the Egyptian qd “make, create, make pots by circling, circle” were discussed above.114 The West Semitic: kad “jug, jar” is attested in Ugaritic, Phoenician and Hebrew. As kad is generally thought to be of unknown origin, an Egyptian origin seems likely despite the distinction in both languages between /q/ and /k/.115 Frisk describes the Greek kavdo" as “Mediterranean,” while Chantraine following Emilie Masson sees the Greek word as a Semitic loan.116 A Semitic loan is probable, but a borrowing directly from Egyptian is also possible. Having agreed that kádos has a Semitic origin, it is surprising that Chantraine should describe khqiv" “vase” with a derivative khqavrion “urn used in voting” as having “no etymology.” He follows Ventris and Chadwick in seeing an early form of *kåthis in the Mycenaean kati. Kati could almost equally well be seen as a prototype of kádos. In any event, Maria-Luisa Mayer argued plausibly that ket\his was Semitic.117
The determinative % (V19) is generally believed to represent a “hobble
for cattle,” but it is also used with other significations: in the words tmÅ “mat,” hÅr “sack” and in other names for woven and wicker work objects. In particular, it appears in the Late Egyptian gÅsr “a measure for milk.” This provides a plausible etymology for krhsevra (4) “sieve or strainer.” The phonetics are certainly better than Chantraine’s tentative links to the Latin cribrum or the Irish criathur “sieve.” The derivation of Greek tinavssw (tinavxai, tinavgmo") “shake, winnow” from an Egyptian *dˆt nqr “cause to sift” was discussed in Chapter 9.118 The early form tÅb “vessel, bowl”—tbw in Late Egyptian and jop in Coptic—provides a good etymology for truvblion (5) “bowl, basin.” Frisk and Chantraine agree that it has “no etymology.” Another strong possibility is that  ̈tÅb is the etymon of travmpi" (3) “barbarian boat.” This the lexicographers see as a loan word. Some of the Egyptian words covered in this section have remained practical and specific in Greek: for example, máris “a liquid measure” and khalinós “reins, anchor.” Others, such as the Egyptian wrmt “awnings, tent roof,” have risen in Greek from the practical to the abstract and transcendent, such as ouranós and Olympos. Taken together the range shows the profound penetration of Egyptian culture at many different levels of Greek society.



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 365
COOKING
Vocabulary indicates that Egyptian influence was particularly intense in the cultural area of cooking and eating.
During the Old Kingdom the sign ± (w6) was used to denote “a par
ticular type of vessel.” It was used as a determinative in the word w ̇Åt
“cauldron.”119 In the Middle and New Kingdoms + (w8) and ≠ (w7)
succeeded ±, both meaning “vessels,” and used as a phonetic/determi
native Åb. The Greek levbh" (H) means “cauldron, basin.” Frisk wants to link it to lopós “shell, rind” but admits that it may be a foreign word.120 Chantraine states bluntly “no etymology.” Frisk and Chantraine derive lafuvssw (H) “swallow gluttonously” from the Indo-European root *lap' or *lab “lick, lap.” The insistence on greed suggests that it was influenced or contaminated by ÅfŒ in Middle Egyptian and Œfy in the later language. Both these forms mean “glutton, gluttony.” Vycichl reconstructs a form *ÅåfiŒ or *Œaf[y]. The first provides an excellent phonetic parallel with laphy:sso\to match the semantic one. The Egyptian ˆÅm is “bind for sacrifice”; ˆÅm n means “to offer to.” The Greek e[rano" (H) is “a religious feast to which everyone brings a portion.” Chantraine sees its origin as “obscure” but suggests a connection with eJorthv (H) “festival” and eJortikov" “offerings given at festivals.” Neither he nor Frisk can find a clear etymology for these two forms. There are, in fact, plausible sources in h≥Åw ht° “special offering” or h≥Åwh≥r ht° “abundance of offerings.” The semantic parallel between ˆŒ w “breakfast” and h[ia (H) “provisions for a voyage” is excellent and there is no phonetic objection to the etymology. Chantraine tentatively suggests a connection to eimi “to go.” The scholiasts stated clearly that e{rpi" (3) was an Egyptian word for “wine.” Modern lexicographers have found the etymon in the Egyptian ˆrp “wine.” They cannot, however, explain the aspiration in the Greek word. At least one other example of Greek hypercorrection of this type is found in iJereuv" “priest,” which comes from a cluster of words concerned with religion and its organization around the biliteral ˆÅ-.121 Another Greek word that may well derive from ˆrp is e[lpo" (6) “leather bottle.” The poet Sappho uses it to refer to a container for wine; later writers use it as a bottle for oil. Chantraine takes the latter as the basic sense and links it to an Indo-European root *selp, which we find in the English “salve.” He is unconcerned about the lack of aspiration.



366 BLACK ATHENA
In Volume 2, I discussed the derivation of [Atla" and jAtlavnti" from the Egyptian ˆtrw “river, sea.”122 Two fish names e[teli” (4) and ijqouliv" (2), for which neither Thompson nor Chantraine can find an etymology, would seem to have the same origin.
The Egyptian wŒb “pure” was mentioned in Chapter 9 in the discus
sion of *pÅ wŒb / Phoibos.123 Two extensions are the Middle Egyptian
wŒbt with the determinative for meat “meat offering” and in Late Egyp
tian wŒbt with the sign for a house as “kitchen.” Lexicographers have great difficulties with ojptov" (H) “meat roast on a skewer.” Chantraine is inclined to accept Benveniste’s view that it should be seen as related to pevssw (H) “cook, ripen.” This suggestion requires a hypothetical form
*(E2)p-kw, with, in the case of optós, a suffix -to. A derivation from wŒbt
seems simpler. A later borrowing found in oiv`bo" (2CE), a butchery term for the “back of a bull’s neck,” was also mentioned in Chapter 9. Pésso\and possibly e{yw (5) “cook, boil” and o[yon (H) “side dish or relish” probably derive from psˆ or psw. This became in Coptic pise prenominal pes(t)- and presuffixal past: “cook.” Chantraine declared that the etymologies of hépso\and ópson were “obscure.” The derivation of povrko" “wicker fish trap” from *pÅ Œrq “the basket” was discussed in Chapter 9.124 In Late Egyptian Œrq also meant “weapon case.” This provides reasonable etymologies for o[llix (2) “drinking cup made of wood” and a[rakin (3) “pan.” Chantraine has no explanation for either. It is possible that the Late Egyptian Œkk “loaves,” became the Demotic kŒ kŒ “type of cake” and the Coptic c#a(a)c#e with the same meaning. In any event at least the latter two are related to the Demotic verb kk, Coptic c=o\c=“to roast, bake.”125 C+erny, following Alfred Wiedemann, accepted kŒ kŒ as the etymon of the Greek kavkei", kakei'~ “kind of bread.”126 Neither Frisk nor Chantraine entered a lemma for this. Œdn “crucible, smelting furnace” provides a strong etymology for e[tno" “thick soup, puree.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine supply any explanation for the word.
The Egyptian wÅˆ “roast? grains,” is a plausible etymon for oujlaiv (H) “grains of barley put on head of sacrifice.” Frisk and Chantraine agree that the term is ancient and postulate an initial  ̧/w/ but go no further. The derivation of “oasis” from w ̇Åt “oasis” has been mentioned above.127 Its basic meaning, however, was “cauldron, pot.” In this sense it is a possible etymon for hjqevw (4) “to filter.” Chantraine considers re



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 367
moving -qw as a suffix, disregarding the lack of aspiration and, thereby linking it to Slav and Germanic words with initial s- and meaning “sieve.” The Egyptian etymology is worse semantically and hardly better phonetically. However, the second century CE humorist Athenaios, who was
born in Naucratis in Egypt, claimed that a derivative hjqavnion (3) “collander” was a term used in Egyptian households.128 Muss-Arnolt tentatively suggested that the source was from Egyptian “heti.”129 The vowel is, of course, unknown and there is the slight problem with aspiration, even so neither *h≥tˆ “bowl” nor wh≥Åt can be simply accepted or dismissed. In any event, given the far-fetched quality of the IndoEuropean etymology, ethéo\ and ethánion almost certainly derive from Egyptian. The term BÅkbÅk, a “type of cake” was presumably related to pÅq, a “fine or flat cake.” bbbbbaaaaavrraaxx
rraaxx
rax (2) was a type of cake which Chantraine saw as “possibly foreign.” The likelihood of an ancient loan is increased by variants bhvrax in Attic and pavrax at Thera. BÅd “jar” corresponds well with bladuv" “flask.” Chantraine puzzlingly subsumes it under amjaldunvw “efface” and links it to the IndoEuropean root *mol “soft, tender.” The Late Egyptian br—Coptic bo\re, Modern Egyptian fori, Arabic buri “mullet”—provides a certain etymon for bwreuv" type of “mullet with which the Egs. make conserves.” Thompson and Chantraine have no doubt about the derivation.130 One sense of the word bh'ssa is as a cup that is large at the bottom and narrow at the top. Chantraine sees it as merely a metaphorical use of the word be\ssa “wooded glen or gorge.” Constantin Daniel interprets a passage from Athenaios to claim that the name came from the shape of Bes.131 Chantraine is unable to find an acceptable etymology for the basic meaning of bh'ssa (H). There is, however, a good one from the Semitic ÷bs≥s≥ found in the Hebrew bis≥s≥åh “swamp.” The Egyptian origins of pw'ma “container for bread” puramiv" “cake” and basuniva" “type of cake offered at Delos” were all discussed in Chapter 9.132 With /Å/ as a liquid bdÅ “large jar [flat bottomed?]” fits well with patavnh Sicilian. batavnh, Latin patera or patella “large cooking pot.” Chantraine sees the cluster as “Mediterranean.” PÅq could also be the origin of plivkion (2CE) a “type of cake” for which Chantraine provides no etymology. PÅt “cake or loaf used in offerings” provides a good etymon for



368 BLACK ATHENA
palavqh “dried fruit, pressed in a mold.” Chantraine dismisses Lewy’s Semitic derivation of the word. He prefers the proposal that paláthe is cognate with the Old High German flado from which comes our “flan.” If these two are connected, flado could equally well be a loan. Another plausible later borrowing from pÅt is fqoi'" “sacrificial cheese cake, offered to the gods.” Chantraine is inclined to see it as a loan. The lexicographer Hesykhios describes the obscure word fh'ro" as “ancient food for the gods.” The traditional comparison has been with the Latin far “wheat flower used in sacrifices.” The semantics are indeed very close. Chantraine, however, describes the phonetic derivation as “very uncertain.” One possible solution is that both derive from pÅt and its plural pÅwt “offerings, cakes, loaves food.” In Chapter 7 I referred to the derivation of the Latin panis “bread” from the Egyptian psn a loaf.133 I did not mention the West Greek and Messapian panov" “bread” used in Apulia. Another borrowing from psn is paxama'" “biscuit.” Chantraine follows the tradition that paxamâs derives from the name of an otherwise unknown baker. This seems less probable than the Egyptian etymology. Mhˆ “milk jar,” mhˆ t “milch cow,” provide a source for a[mh" “milk cake.” Chantraine provides no etymology. MgÅr “broil or grill” mageireuvw (4) “cook meat” is first attested in Late Egyptian. Because of its lateness and the alternatives mÅqw/mqÅw, James Hoch believes that this could well be a loan into Egyptian from the Semitic ÷qly to “bake or roast.”134 Whether or not he is correct in this, there is no reason to doubt Redford’s suggestion that, given the precision of roasting meat, mgÅr should be related to mageireúo.\135 The /g/ in the Greek form, indicates that the most plausible sequence is Semitic>Egyptian >Greek. The Latin magirus “cook” comes from the Greek. mágeiros. Chantraine concludes “no established etymology.” NdÅ “measure for loaves and dates” makes a plausible etymon for ojnquleuvw (4) “to stuff or fill in cooking.” Chantraine writes about this “these culinary terms are without etymologies.” For the derivation of ajqavrh “flour casserole” from ntr see Chapter 10.136 The Egyptian origin a[rto" (H) from rt ̇ “bake” was discussed in Volume 2.137 H≥qr “hunger” provides a good etymon for ai\klon (6) “Dorian evening meal.” As for its etymology, Chantraine states simply that it is “unknown.” Another food-related etymology has parallels in the animal world.



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 369
The Greek ajlwvphx (6) or ajlwpov" “fox” appears to have a strong IndoEuropean etymology with cognates in the Latvian lapsa and Sanskrit lopa\sav“jackal.” The likelihood, however, is that these are loans from Greek and that the original is the Egyptian sÅb “jackal.” The variation alo\pe\x, alo\pos and the prothetic alpha indicate a loan into Greek. Further arguments for this hypothesis are that jackals are rare around the Baltic and that Aristotle specified that alo\pe\x was an Egyptian fox.138 Beyond this was the medical use of alo\pe\x to describe the “muscles of the loins.” This
can be explained by the use of the determinative, R (F27) for SÅb.
The two determinatives ∞ (E17) and R appear to have been used for
both “jackal” and “hyena.”139 Although the standard modern reading of sÅb is as “jackal,” a number of homonyms indicating “dappled” or “multicolored” suggest that it was also widely used for the striped or spotted hyena. In this sense sÅb provides a plausible etymon for the Greek sivlbh (5CE) “cake made of barley, sesame and poppy seed.” Chantraine dismisses the suggestion that it is somehow related to the Hittite si=luh°a “type of cake” and describes it as merely a loan. The etymology of psar “[multicolored] starling,” from pÅ sÅb was discussed in Chapter 9.140
The metathesis from sÅb, to *sbÅ “hyena” would explain the maneating, cave-dwelling, monster of the wilds, Suvbari". Sybaris was equated
with another man-eating monster Lavmia.± This would seem to come from the Afroasiatic root *labi> the Hebrew låbii> “lion, wild cat” or the Egyptian Åby “panther” all deriving from the Afroasiatic root *labi> “lion, wild cat, hyena.”141 Thus, many monsters of Greek myth can be explained as originating from large, fierce African animals. Even the Saharan paintings indicate a delight in specially bred bicolored cattle.142 Egyptians and Cretans preferred them for sacrifice. SÅb was also a term used for social superiors and high officials. Sybaris was, of course, the name of a city in Lucania in southern Italy, famous for its luxury. The association between luxury and variety is always very close. It can also be seen in the synonym to sybaris, poikilvo" “many colored luxurious.” Thus, it seems more likely that Sybaris was named after its luxury *sbÅ rather than the other way around. Chantraine believes that the term cabivtia (3) “receptacles for honey?” is an “obscure loan.” Oswald Szemerényi derives it from the Aramaic h°wt < *h°awita “jug.”143 This itself could be a loan from the Egyptian s=wbty “jar.” The fact that the attestation was found in Egypt could indicate that khabítia came directly from Egyptian, but this is largely, if not
entirely, nullified by the time required for the pronunciation of ß as



370 BLACK ATHENA
/h°/. On the other hand, sevbi" (sebivtion)(5CE) “box” could well be a late borrowing from s=wbty. S+ns “cake or loaf ” provides a good etymology for ajcaivnh (?) “large loaf cooked for the Thesmorphoria.” Chantraine states simply “without etymology.” Strabo wrote that kavkei" or kakei'" were a kind of Egyptian “loaves.”144 In Middle Egyptian Œqw are “loaves,” perhaps confused with the form qÅqÅ “eat” only attested in Late Egyptian. As a verb qfn is “to bake” as a noun it is “loaf.” kapnov" (H) is “smoke, smell of cooking to smoke, warm.” Chantraine sees it as cognate to the Lithuanian kvepi etc. “breathe.” This is almost certainly linked to kavmino" (5) “furnace, oven” (kami–ni–vth") “bread baked in oven” kamineuv" “worker with a furnace” [there is an Egyptian form qfnw “baker”]. Chantraine sees the Greek terms as probable loans. The Late Egyptian krst, klst in Demotic, was “bread made from spelt.” All scholars agree that this is the origin of kullh§sti" (5) “bread made from spelt.”145 T-h≥d “white bread” h≥t in Demotic and hat in Coptic provides a good etymology for qiwvth" (2CE) “type of bread,” Chantraine makes no etymological suggestion. *T-Œqw(n) “bread loaves for” is a plausible etymon for qiagovne" (2CE) “type of bread provided for the gods.” Chantraine provides no etymology.
The Late Egyptian tÅh≥ “souse, dip in water,” appears in the Greek as tariceuvw (5) “pickle fish, put in salt.” Herodotos and others used it to describe “mummification.”146 Chantraine has no explanation for this term and denies any connection with tarcuvw (H) “bury as a hero.” Chantraine denies any connection with tarikheuo\ on phonetic grounds and the semantic side by the fact that tarkhuo\is never used to describe embalmment. He prefers to see it as a loan from Asia Minor and the Hittite root tarh°“conquer.” The slight phonetic distinction between tarikheuo\ and tarkhuo\disappears completely if they are both borrowings from a third language. As for the semantics the most heroic funeral of all, that of Patroklos, began with pouring honey into his nostrils.147 The parallels between Egyptian pharaohs and Greek heroes that were discussed in Volume 2 also lessen the barriers between tarkhuo\and mummification.148 Drp “present offerings, provide a meal” and drpw “offerings, meal sustenance” would seem to be the origin of dovrpon (H) “afternoon meal, feast,” and dovlpai (6CE) “small cake.” With metathesis of liquids, it also



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 371
can explain dei'pnon (H) “main meal, feast.” Chantraine has no etymologies for any of these terms. Dsrt “strong thick [red?] ale” provides an excellent origin for zwrov" (H) pure and thick of wine.” Chantraine denies previous attempts to link zo\ros to the Sanskrit jaru “hard” and concludes “unknown.” With some phonetic difficulty dsrt could be the etymon of zu'qo", which Theophrastos and later writers maintained was the Egyptian word for “beer.” Chantraine could not find an Egyptian etymology for this but Szemerényi proposed that zythos and the Sogdian zwtk were both borrowed from an unknown Scythian original.149
Conclusion on cooking
Many of the Greek words in this section are related to religious offerings, but others are secular, although they may have derived from the religious. It should be remembered that sacrifices and offerings provided a significant part of the Greek diet. The profound Egyptian association with Greek religion has been a central theme of the whole Black Athena project, but this section further reveals the important role of Egypt in the creation of Greek sophistication and luxury.
MEDICINE
The “international” reputation of Egyptian medicine is well known. So too is the widespread acceptance of the idea that Greek medicine borrowed heavily from it.150 Therefore, one would expect the specialized and often obscure Egyptian terminology to have influenced the Greek medical vocabulary. ˆÅt is the “appearance of pustule or wound.”151 jErevqw (H) is to “excite, inflame, a wound.” Chantraine sees the final -qw as a suffix and the root as found in o[rnomi “excite, stir up.” The Egyptian etymology is closer in both its phonetics and semantics. From the Greco-Roman period we have ˆwn “pillar”; there are also wnw, auein, ou(e)in “water channel?” aijwvn (H) “spinal marrow, vital force, life” (later, long period of time).152 Chantraine sees it as cognate to the Sanskrit a\yu- “vital force” and a\yus≥, as well as the Latin aevus “duration.” It is clear that there is an Indo-European root here, but Egyptian also appears to be involved. Where Onians saw “spinal marrow” as the



372 BLACK ATHENA
primary sense of aio\n, Chantraine makes it secondary. The likelihood that Onians was right is increased by the fact that in Egyptian anatomy the spinal cord was seen as the vital force flowing from the brain to the penis.153 The technical term for this was not ˆwn but ˆmÅh,° which also meant “blessed state of the dead.”154 Nevertheless, ˆwn as pillar clearly had physiological meanings, such as ˆwn n fnd “nasal bone” and sexual ones as in ˆwn mwtf the “pillar of his mother,” an epithet of Horus. This and *pÅ ˆwn-Paihvwn, Apollo will be discussed in Chapter 19. ˆwh≥ m was “to sprinkle, moisten” and in the medical vocabulary “to moisten with/in a drug.” In Greek aijonavw (5) “to bathe, moisten” is a medical term for which Chantraine gives no etymology. The noun ˆnw “produce, tribute,” is related to the verb ˆnˆ, Coptic eine (S) or ini (B) “to bring, fetch, carry off.” In the last sense, it provides a good etymology for ai[numai (H) “to take, seize, especially food.” Chantraine hypothesizes an Indo-European root *ai- “to give” found in the Tocharian B. ai and the Hittite p-ai, with a nasal infix. Although I did not in Chapter 12 absolutely rule out a semantic relationship between taking and giving in the case of the Greek nemo “to allocate” and the Germanic nehman “taking” such a switch is unlikely.155 It is certainly not plausible, given the simplicity of ai and the existence of a strong Egyptian competitor. A subordinate meaning of ˆnˆ is “to reach, attain” and in compounds “to go to the limits.” See a[nu–mi or ajnuvw (H) “complete, go to the end.” Chantraine traces these to a hypothetical *sn≥-nu which he finds in the Sanskrit sanóti “win” and the Hittite s=anh°-zi “he looks for.” The semantics are loose and the lexicographer does not find any trace of aspiration in the Greek words. In medical usage ˆnˆ could mean “remove something harmful.” The Greek medical term ijnavw (5) meant “evacuate, empty purge.” Chantraine tries to link it to the Sanskrit is≥-na-±ti “set in motion, lance.” He admits that there is no indication in the Greek word of the long i| required for the relationship with is≥-na-±ti. Chantraine rightly points out perivneo" (4) “perineum” is “around the evacuation.” ŒÅ Œ was a medical term for “poison in the stomach.”156 jExeravw means (5) “to vomit, evacuate bowels.” Chantraine, basing himself on a scholiast’s comment on line 993 in Aristophanes’ The Wasps, interprets exerao\as “to earth” e[ra. Clearly, punning was involved but the Egyptian etymon is considerably more precise.



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 373
œntyw “resin myrrh” is the origin of ajevntion which the lexicographer Hesykhios defines as “the Egyptian for myrrh.” Chantraine willingly accepts that muvrra± itself comes from a basic West Semitic term murru.
In Chapter 8, I discussed the relationship between Œs=Å “many, numerous, plentiful, rich” and o[clo" (5) and the developed meaning “pustule or bodily growth.”157 In Chapter 5, I mentioned the word ŒqÅ “straightforward” as part of the compound ŒqÅ ˆb “exact, accurate,” found in the Greek akribe\s with the same meaning.158 In medical terminology ŒqÅ meant “make right, heal.”159 A[ko" (H) was “remedy,” and ajkevomai “care for, cure.” Chantraine tries valiantly but unsuccessfully to find links to the hypothetical Indo-European root *ak “sharp.”160 Thus, it is probable that akos is a borrowing from ŒqÅ, again after/Å/ had lost its consonantal force. Chantraine describes favrmakon (H) as “isolated in Greek, to the extent that that one should think of a borrowed term.” He tries to avoid this by linking phar- to fevrw “bear” and seeing -akos as a suffix for plants. Nevertheless, he concludes, “the question of the origin of favrmakon is insoluble at the present state of our knowledge.” If, in the absence of an Indo-European etymology, one should consider a loan, the obvious place to begin is with Egyptian. The association of pharmakon “plant or drug” with Egypt goes back at least to Homer: “For there [Egypt] the earth, giver of grain, bears the greatest store of drugs [pharmaka] . . . there every man is a physician, wise above human kind.”161 The suffix -akos can be explained by ŒqÅ “cure remedy.” The initial phar- can plausibly be derived either from phr(t) pahre (S) “prescription, remedy” or from the Demotic phr or Coptic phaher (B) “bewitch.” The -m- could come from the preposition m “with.” While all the elements are present, I have not found the combination and, therefore, the etymology can only be classified as “reasonable.”
Two parallel words exist in Egyptian, wbÅ and wdŒ. WbÅ “drill, open,
explore” had as its determinative √ (U26) “drill, boring a hole in a bead.”
WdŒ, written with Ó (Aa21) which Gardiner described as “a carpenter’s
tool,” meant “to cut off, cut out.” In Greek there exists a cluster of words around ojbelov"/ojdelov" (H) involving the meaning “iron spit.” Obeloi or oboloi were used as currency. Six held together formed a handful or dracmh.1v62 While Chantraine cannot explain the prothetic o- or anything else about the etymology, he argues that the alternation /b/-/d/ in obelos/odelos indicates an original labiovelar. It is more plausible to



374 BLACK ATHENA
suppose that the alternation arose through confusion between the two Egyptian words. Phonetically, the correspondence between wbÅ and obelos is excellent. In semantics there is an extraordinary parallel between WdŒ “be parted as the lips of a wound” and ojbelai'o" “sagittal suture of the
skull.” It is quite possible that Ó was a “crown saw” for removing part of
the skull. The Egyptians also practiced trepanning with drills. Orel and Stolbova propose two Afroasiatic roots for “lung”; both are plausibly onomatopoeic: *fuf and *f[ü]Œ.163 They set the Egyptian wfÅ wfˆ or wpÅ in the second series.164 The Coptic forms are ouof ouo\f (S) or ouob (B). Gardiner constructs an earlier *wa]fÅew.165 Chantraine sees aujayhv “consumption” as having been contaminated by a[ptw “touch” but also “light up.” He provides no etymology. On balance, I think the Egyptian etymology is less improbable. The Late Egyptian bkˆ “fruit or balsam tree” was borrowed from the Semitic ÷bk>, the Hebrew båkå>. The Greek bhvx (5) “cough, plant remedy for a cough.” A loan from Semitic or Egyptian seems more likely than Chantraine’s suggestion that it is onomatopoeic. The Egyptian pds meant “pill, pellet.” In Greek pessov" Attic pettov" was “an oval stone used in games” and, medically, “pessary.” The alternation in Greek could arise from uncertainty over the Egyptian sibilant. Chantraine describes it as a “substrate or foreign term” and agrees with Frisk in rejecting other attempted Indo-European etymologies. The Egyptian mt “strip of cloth” appears in two forms in Greek. First there is mivto" (H) “thread, ribbon, tape.” Chantraine rejects all the etymologies cited by Frisk and describes mitos as a “technical term without etymology.” For motov" (5) “bandage, lint,” Chantraine simply writes “unknown.” Orel and Stolbova argue that the Afroasiatic root *mut “man” comes from *mawut “die” in the sense that all men are mortal.166 From there it is possible, as Vycichl suggests, that one can derive the Egyptian mtwt or read, as I argue in Chapter 9, *mwtt.167 This word has two apparently contrasting meanings: semen and poison. A parallel to this is the medical term œÅœ “ejaculation, poison.”168 Vycichl tentatively proposes that the two can be linked as “secreted materials, one from men and the others from snakes and scorpions.169 Mivto" appears in Orphic language as “seed,” which further strengthens evidence of Egyptian mysteries in Orphism. R-dr “all, entire” and r-drf “to its end” as the origins of Lavquro", a



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 375
surname of Ptolemy VIII and a medical “purge” have all been touched on in Chapters 9 and 10.170 Rpw “rot” provides an excellent etymon for rJuvpo" (4) “dirt,” on skin, sheets etc. Chantraine gives no etymology. In Egyptian hÅ°yt appears to have a general meaning of “disease.” The Greek ci–rav" (6 CE) has the more specific meaning “fissures in the feet.” The etymology remains plausible, despite the semantic distance because of the lack of a plausible alternative. Chantraine rejects attempts to link it to a Germanic form gi\r “vulture.” The fundamental sense of h°m is “not to know, be ignorant,” but it has the extended meanings of “unconscious, paralyzed.” The rare Greek word ijkmameno" means “ wounded.” Apart from speculating whether the basic root was ijkm-, ijgm- or ijcm- (any of which would fit h°m), Chantraine has no idea about its origin. In 1953 Jernstedt plausibly proposed that sth'qo" “breast, seat of emotions” derived from *st h≥Åty “place of the heart, emotions.”171 Chantraine sees the etymology as “obscure.” He mentions the Sanskrit stána “woman’s breast” but has no explanation for the final -qo". On the basis of the Coptic forms saein (S) and sei\ni (B), Vycichl maintained that the original vocalization of swnw “doctor” was probably *synw. This speculation is weakened by what appear to be Greek borrowings that suggest *sawono. Swnnuvw (H) is to “save from death, keep alive, preserve” but is part of a cluster around swÛzw and sw'", originally savo" (H), “save, safety, good health.” Chantraine reasonably reconstructs sa ̧. He then goes on to associate it with Sanskrit words based on the
root *tav “strong” and to reconstruct a rounded form *tw ú. This hypothetical structure makes the problems with an etymology from swnw pale into insignificance. According to Orel and Stolbova, an Afroasiatic root ÷h≥Vsaw means “drink.” Vycichl sees this word as related to the Egyptian swr with the same meaning.172 In medical terminology, swr was also used for “purgative, vomit.”173 S uv—rw (5) is “to drag out, slime trail, sweep, purge emetic.” Chantraine doubts any connection to the Old High German swerben “wipe out.” Sbsy is “to cause to flow forth” or, medically, “to make vomit, to effect a cure.”174 The Greek sbevnnu–mi (H) with the root ÷sbes “extinguish” applies to storms, anger, rage etc. Chantraine sees an IndoEuropean root *gwes “extinguish, exhausted, disappear” attested in Baltic and Sanskrit. But he has difficulties attaching sbennu\mi to it.



376 BLACK ATHENA
smÅ “kill, destroy illness,” written with the determinative for knife F
(T30) make an excellent etymon for smi—vlh (2CE) “knife, chisel, and surgeon’s scalpel.” Chantraine follows Pokorny who attaches smile±\to an Indo-European root *smi-tu found in Germanic. Originally it meant “carpenter” but later became “smith.” The Egyptian derivation is more precise in both sound and meaning. Sh°n “sweetbread, pancreas, kidney in suet” provides a good etymology for the medical term sacnov" (2CE) “tender of meat.”175 Chantraine sees it as related to swvcw or ywvcw “rub.” SqŒ “to cause to vomit” fits well with sikcov" (4) “disgusting food.” Chantraine calls it an “expressive” term without an etymology. S+nw is “hair” in medical texts and s=nˆ means “eyelashes.”176 This would explain the main element in ejpiskuvnion (H) “eyebrows.” Chantraine sees skuvn- as the theme. With an alternation of n/r, he tentatively relates it to the Old High German skur “shelter.” Yuvdrax (3) was a “pustule on the nose.” This could come either from s=ds=d or *pÅ s=ds=d “protuberance on a standard.” The looseness of the phonetics is made up for by the extraordinary precision of the semantic parallel. The traditional explanation was to derive psydrax from pseud- on the grounds that lying leads to spots.177 Nineteenth-century linguists preferred to link psydrax to a PIE root *bhes “breath” and the Germanic blasen “bubble” or the English “blister.” The semantics of the latter parallel are reasonable, although not as good as the Egyptian etymology. The phonetic connection is hard to detect. Orel and Stolbova propose an Afroasiatic root *k∫irVb “breast, belly.”
The Semitic qirb and the Egyptian qÅb both meant “intestine.” π
(F46) served both as a determinative and as a triliteral for a number of words that, with other additional determinatives, signified “fold over, double, coiled, snake, windings of a waterway.” The Coptic forms were ko\b, qualitative ke\b). kovlpo" (H) meant “bosom, sinuses of the womb, fold of a garment, gulf or bay.” Chantraine derived it from a root found in the Old Norse hualf “vault.” Kal(l)abiv", performed by kallibavnte", was the name of a sinuous Spartan dance. The ancient lexicographer Hesykhios gave another meaning to kallibantes “a type of scissors [double] used for cutting eyebrows.” Chantraine has no explanation for either form. Latin has a clear, although probably indirect borrowing from qÅb in colubra or coluber “snake” from which, through Portuguese, comes the English “cobra.” Ernout and Meillet state that colubra is “without a clear



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 377
etymology.” Eric Partridge wrote that it was “probably from the Egyptian.” The phonetic correspondence between qÅb and kovlon is limited. The semantic connection, however, is perfect as both mean “intestine.” The chances that qÅb was originally pronounced *qwlb with a labiovelar are increased by the number of Greek words with similar semantics with a root ÷delph, indicating a loan of *qwlb into Greek before the breakdown of labiovelars. These are discussed in Chapter 19. Qrf seems to have been a “bag.” As a verb it was certainly “to contract, draw together.” In medical terminology qrft were “contractions” and qrfw were “facial wrinkles.” In Greek gravpi" (5) means “wrinkled.” Chantraine links it to gravfw “write” in the sense of drawing a line. This might be plausible in the absence of the Egyptian etymology. Qrf(w) in the sense of “wrinkled bag or belly” also provides an etymon for grovmfi" (5) “old sow.” Chantraine links this to gru,v gruvzw “to grunt, scold, talk in a loud voice.” There may well be confusion between the two sources here. It has long been recognized that the Late Egyptian qrnt “foreskin, uncircumcised phallus” derived from the Semitic g;rl “foreskin, uncircumcised phallus.”178 At this point we encounter an issue of considerable sensitivity: Did this word also refer to female “circumcision” or genital mutilation? Krhmnov" (H) means “cliff, escarpment, river banks” and “labia.” Chantraine links it to a cluster of words with different spellings around kremavnnu–mi “suspend, hang down.” For instance, there is kremavstra “tail of a flower that hangs.” Chantraine rejects earlier IndoEuropean etymologies for kremannumi. Krhvnh (H) is “fountain, spring.” Chantraine links it to krounov" (H) “spring” used figuratively of “blood, lava, words etc.” He writes that both “could be” derived from a PIE root *krosno- and linked to the Germanic *hrazno “flow, water in [horizontal] movement.” Apart from the lack of evidence from Greek of a medial -s-, this seems rather different from the spring or vaginal associations of kre\mnos, kre\ne\ and krounos. Pausanias refers to Kolainiv" as an epithet of Artemis, could this refer to the wild goddess as being “uncircumcised”?179 Finally, there is krhvi>on, an Ionian term for a kind of “bride cake.” TÅˆ “man, bull calf ” written with a more explicitly coital determina
tive than ' (D53) provides a reasonable etymology for qrwvskw (H)
“spurt out, impregnate.” Chantraine can only find one possible IndoEuropean cognate, the Irish dar “spurt out.” The Egyptian etymology seems slightly preferable in the light of two other terms: qorov" (5)



378 BLACK ATHENA
“semen” and qolov" (5) “contaminated water.” For the relationship between semen and poison, see the discussion on mtwt/mwtt above.180 Orel and Stolbova present three different, but related, Afroasiatic roots: *dVhar “hunt” and *dah≥ar and *dr “drive away.”181 The Egyptian dr had a wide range of meanings: “subdue, destroy, remove, expel [in medical terminology].” The derivation of the Greek dhlevomai (H) “wound, damage, destroy” from dr belongs more properly in the next chapter.182 Here, we are concerned with the meanings “remove” and “expel.” Chantraine describes tivllw (H) “to pull out, pluck, mistreat” as an “isolated term without an etymology.” Having said this, he goes on to speculate that “perhaps it comes from ptivlon ‘feather.’” I see no reason to doubt that tillo\ was influenced by this. Then there is ti'lo" (5) “diarrhoea, expelled juice.” Chantraine writes, “no Indo-European word corresponds exactly to tilos. He then provides a number of very distant parallels, such as the Anglo-Saxon thin±an “be wet.”
CONCLUSION
Most of the loans proposed here are nouns and nearly all are concrete. As I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, I make no attempt to improve on the excellent work of Muss-Arnolt, Lewy, Levin, Brown and others regarding Semitic loans into Greek in the natural world, cooking and medicine. In general, their semantic range is similar to those from Egyptian. Nevertheless, some differences exist. As one might expect from geography, more Egyptian than Semitic words are concerned with marshes and their products. On the other hand, more Semitic loans into Greek can be found for minerals and their processing. Given the ancient reputation of Egyptian medicine, it is not surprising to find more Egyptian than Semitic medical terms in Greek. The startling number of Egyptian culinary loans can be at least partially explained by those associated with religious rituals of Egyptian origin, which tended to be more lavish than those of the Levant. In addition to this there is the fact that many
culinary terms only appear in the Deipnosofistaiv“lectures on dining,” written by Athenaios who came from Naukratis in the Nile Delta. As mentioned in the introduction, the selection of semantic fields has been arbitrary and incomplete. This chapter and Chapters 16 and 17 introduce new examples and, more importantly, show that etymologies proposed in other chapters can be clustered semantically. In this way, the individual items become more plausible. All this, of course, is subject to



[CH. 15] EGYPTIAN AND SEMITIC SEMANTIC CLUSTERS 379
the caveat that the definition of semantic fields is seldom, if ever, clear and many of the examples stray over their arbitrary boundaries. While most of the loans, in this chapter are for material objects and processes associated with them, some have much wider religious and abstract connotations. For instance, it is startling to see ol\ene\“matting or shelter used to bind or cover bricks” connected, through their origin from the Egyptian wrmwt “awnings, roofing,” to ouranos and Olympos. Similarly, the Egyptian Åh°(t) “inundation season, new growth” rises to lakhaino\ “to grow vegetables” and the reduplicated Åh°Åh° to the sacred Rharian plain near Eleusis. More on such large etymological clusters from both Egyptian and Semitic will be given in the following chapters.

CHAPTER 16
I
n the late nineteenth century, Heinrich Lewy discarded abstract and broad-ranging nouns, adjectives and verbs from his list of Semitic loans into Greek. In Chapter 7 I discussed Michel Masson’s approval of this step.1 To remedy the gap left by this self-denying ordinance, in the next two chapters, I shall concentrate on Greek borrowings from both Egyptian and Semitic in precisely the semantic fields ruled out by earlier scholars. These include weapons, warfare, hunting, shipping, society, law, politics and philosophy and religion. In this chapter I focus on the first three. In each section, I shall separate the two source languages, and, as mentioned in the introduction, the ordering of each will follow the conventions of the two disciplines. Egyptian in the Egyptological sequence listed in earlier chapters, starting with /Å/ and ending with the dentals and a final /d/. With Semitic, I simply follow the order of the Hebrew (Canaanite) alphabet, with h°following h≥.
WEAPONS, WARFARE AND HUNTING
Introduction
Weapons, warfare and hunting are areas of potentially great historical significance. In French, for instance, the basic vocabulary of which is



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 381
overwhelmingly Romance, but among the extremely few words of Germanic origin, one finds canif, “small knife”; flèche, “arrow”; galant “warlike man”: hache, “ax”; hâte, “haste, violence”; harpon, “grappling iron”; heaume, “helmet”; héraut, “herald”; maréchal, “officer in charge of horses”; meutrir, “murder”; and guerre, “war” itself. These words confirm the military nature of Frankish rule over what later became France. On the other hand, much of the military vocabulary in Englishcorporal, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel, general etc.—came from French not because of the Norman Conquest but as a result of the organizational prestige of later French armies. Thus, although the introduction of military terminology can be the result of conquest, it is not necessarily so. In this case the number of Egyptian and Semitic terms for weapons, warfare and hunting could come from supposed Hyksos settlements and dominance in parts of Greece. They could also have been acquired by Greek-speaking mercenaries in Late Bronze Age Egypt or from encounters with Egyptian or Canaanite forces or possibly from deliberate remodeling—or at least renaming—of Hellenic social and military organization. The clearest example of this comes from Sparta and will be discussed in Chapter 21. Whatever the route by which words in these semantic areas were introduced their social and political importance gives them special significance.
Egyptian vocabulary
Åbw Demotic Åb, ˆÅb, Åˆbe, wÅˆbe “brand” was written with fire l (Q7)
or became “mutilate” when written with a knife f (T30) of slaves or
cattle. It provides a plausible etymology for lwvbh (H) “outrage, violence, mutilation and subject of shame, or leper.” Chantraine accepts the conventional relationship with Baltic words, a supposed labiovelar and an initial s-, such as the Lithuanian slogà “scourge,” etc. The semantic parallels of this connection are plausibly but the phonetics are cumbersome. Chantraine reasonably links lwvbhx “vulture” to lo\be\.
Åbh°“burn” has the extended sense of “ardor, fervor” providing a plausible etymology for the cluster around λα:βρος (H) “violent, impetuous,” for which, apart from the parallel Latin rabes, neither Frisk nor Chantraine has any Indo-European explanation.



382 BLACK ATHENA
ˆwÅ “longhorned cattle” a[or (H), aor—pronounced as a mono-, di- or even trisyllabic word—is normally translated as “sword.” Its meaning, however, was extended to many types of weapon or, even, equipment. The conceptual link between horns and weapons is quite tight. Take for example the French défenses “tusks.” Chantraine’s attempt to link aor to ajeivrw “suspend” because a sword can be suspended by a leather band is not very convincing. It may be that aor did not merely mean sword and may have retained an original meaning of “horn.” Its use to describe a rhinoceros’ horn is late (3CE), but Crusavoro" “golden aor” an epithet applied to Apollo, Demeter, and Artemis is generally translated “golden sword.”2 Hesiod is specific that the “golden aor” is a “sword” held in the hand.3 Against this interpretation is the relative lateness of swords and the fact that no iconographic evidence shows gods or goddesses with swords. They prefer more ancient bows, clubs or spears. On the other hand, many Greek divinities are represented as horned. “Golden horned” makes much more sense as a translation. Other bovine images include, most famously, bo-w`pi" “cow-eyed” or “cow-faced” to express the beauty of Hera and other goddesses. Hathor the Egyptian goddess of beauty was represented as a cow. In these circumstances, despite the semantic steps required and given the perfect phonetic fit ˆwÅ provides a reasonable etymology for aor. The derivation of o[llumi and ou\lo" “to destroy, destruction” from ŒwÅˆ “harvest, rob, pillage” was set out in Chapter 15.4 Chantraine maintains that the Greek wjqevw (H) “to push hard, throw, repulse, deal harm” is the iterative form of *e{jqw, a form constructed from e{jqwn. The latter word occurs twice in the Iliad and has been interpreted as either “valor” or “following his custom.” Chantraine sees all these as derived from a root *wedh “shake, bump” which he thinks is found in the Sanskrit vádhar “weapon of Indra” or vadar “weapon of jet.”5 He admits, however, that there is no trace of an initial w- in ot\heo.\ It would seem simpler to derive ot\heo\ from wdˆ “throw, shoot arrow, commit offense.” The Egyptian verb wdÅ “to set out, proceed” has as its correlate wdyt “campaign expedition, journey.” With the personal suffix -w/ eus in Chapter 6, it provides an excellent etymology for the name of the wandering hero par excellence jOdusseuv".6 Frisk toys inconclusively with Anatolian origins for the name. Chantraine provides no explanation. For Jernstedt’s proposal that a reconstructed *pÅ Œ ̇Åwt(y) was the origin of fw'", fwtov" “warrior,” see Chapter 9.7



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 383
PÅqyt “shell of turtle, skull” provides a good etymology for phvlhx (H) “helmet, crest of a serpent.” Chantraine says “no etymology, possibly a loan.” The Late Egyptian verb *prt “to split open, tear” appears to be a loan from Semitic. A number of Semitic triliterals, however, are based on the Nostratic root √pr “to split, open, give birth.” James Hoch mentions two possible sources: the first is the Akkadian pala\s=u “to dig, break through a wall,” which in Mishnaic Hebrew can mean “perforate.” Hoch is even less happy on phonetic grounds with a derivation from the Akkadian para\s=u “to divide.” He prefers a borrowing from a root √prt found in the Talmudic Aramaic pErat “to divide, crush” or in Syriac “to divide, pierce.”8 Whatever the precise triliteral root or even source language, a Semitic or Egyptian *prt provides a suitable source for the Greek pevrqw (H) “to destroy, sack, pillage originally of towns.” Frisk and Chantraine agree that, although the word is of an Indo-European type, the etymology is “unknown.” Ancient lexicographers derived the name of the hero Perseuv" from pertho\Chantraine is uncertain and considers the possibility that is pre-Hellenic. The reduplicated ptpt is to “tread roads, trample, trample enemies” and “smite.” Patevw (H) is “to walk, trample, crush.” Frisk sees this and the noun pavto" “trampled path” as deriving from a root found in povnto" “path.” While this etymology is quite possible, the violent Egyptian meanings seem closer to the Greek meaning. Chantraine maintains that mw'lo" (H) “battle, melee” comes from a sense of pain and effort. In this way he relates it to movli" (5) molis “pain, effort.” From here, he connects to the Old High German muodi “tired” and the Russian máju “exhaust.” Both in terms of phonetics and semantics, it would seem simpler to derive mol\os from the Egyptian mry “fighting bull” or mrw “bulls.” In Volume 2, I referred to the work of Alan Lloyd on the Egyptian “tauromachy” “bull fighting bull.”9 Chantraine describes the etymology of movli" (5) as “uncertain.” Mr “ill, pain” or mrt “pains” would seem plausible for this.
Nrˆ is “to fear” or transitively “to overawe” and nrt, nure (S) nuri (B) in Coptic is “vulture.” The latter provides a good semantic basis for e[nara (H) “arms taken from a beaten enemy.” Chantraine tentatively relates enara to the Sanskrit sanóti “win” sánitar “victor.” He does admit the difference in sense and the lack of the expected aspiration in the Greek word. Chantraine maintains that the etymology of ni–vkh “victory” is



384 BLACK ATHENA
“unknown.” He denies Pokorny’s attempt to link it to nei`ko" “quarrel” because it “is not convincing in either form or sense.” The Egyptian nht° “strong, victorious” nht°t or nht°w “victory” would seem more plausible. The possibility of a front vowel is increased by the Greek rendition of the pharaoh’s name Nh°t nb f as Nektanebo. A special extension of nht° is nht° ˆ nes=te in Coptic (although Vycichl anticipated a Bohairic form *nas=qe) “giant.” This provides an excellent etymon for naxo" an epithet for kolossov". It is interesting to note that Navxo" is the largest and the highest of the Cycladic islands. The Egyptian mn(n)wt “fortress” probably derives from mn “firm, established.” It forms a plausible etymon for ajmu—vnw (H) “to defend.” Although no form of the verb and its derivatives lacks an /n/, Chantraine sees it as merely a suffix with a basic root ajmu-. He is unable to explain this assumption. In Chapter 9, I discussed *PÅ Rqw “enemy” as the origin of the name of the Phlegyans.10 On its own, Rqw reduplicated in Coptic (B) luklak “enmity opponent” provides a good etymology for leukov" (5) “violence, rage.” Chantraine finds none of the previous Indo-European etymologies satisfactory. HÅˆ has a wide range of meanings, including “descend, charge down
upon, tackle, accede to office.” O[rnumai; (H) is “to dash forward, excite, give birth.” In this case, unlike that for amy\no\ Chantraine sees the -n- as part of the root. This view is paradoxical because many verbal tenses
and other derivatives of o[rnumai;lack an -n-. Chantraine has problems finding non-Greek cognates for this and with Pokorny was reduced to deriving it from a root *er.
Sft Xivfo" “sword.” In their critique of my work, Jasanoff and Nussbaum conceded that the culturally central word xíphos “sword” has no known Indo-European etymology and “that it is not impossible that . . . [it] has been borrowed into Greek from some other language.”11 They also agreed that the idea that it comes from the Egyptian sft, Coptic se\fe “sword” is an old one, although they did not mention that it is still one maintained by modern scholars.12 They denied this apparently plausible etymology on technical grounds set out by the Egyptologist R. H. Pierce. Pierce’s first reason for rejecting the Egyptian origin was that the Coptic form indicates that the vowel in Middle Egyptian was stressed and long, while that of xíphos is short.



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 385
Antonio Loprieno has illustrated the precariousness of reconstructing Middle Egyptian vocalic pronunciation; this was discussed in Chapter 8.13 The length of the vowel in the “pre-Coptic” reconstruction of sft does not provide a serious objection to the etymology.14 Rightly, Chantraine does not refer to Pierce’s argument on vowel length in his denial of the Egyptian origin. His objection is the more serious one, also taken up by Jasanoff and Nussbaum, that a Mycenaean form of xíphos can be found in the dual qisipee and that, therefore, it could not derive from sft. As I pointed out in Volume 2, there is a problem with interpreting this stricture too rigidly because the labiovelar indicated, *kws, would be expected to breakdown to form *psíphos.15 Szemerényi tries to explain away this anomaly by saying that it resulted from a “postMycenaean dissimilation of the labial element in /kw/ caused by the following labial.” Even he admits that the one parallel he gives for this is very uncertain.16 The initial qi in qisipee may simply be a rhyming soft velar and sibilant, indicating a fricative in loaning language. On the principle of Wörter und Sachen, it should be noted that considerable archaeological evidence (including that from Manfred Bietak’s excavations at Tel Ed Dab’a, the Hyksos capital of Avaris) now indicates that double-edged bronze weapons can be found from Egypt during the Second Intermediate period.17 Furthermore, the double-edged blades found in the Shaft Graves of Mycenae depict strikingly Egyptian scenes.18 Thus, there is a perfect semantic fit between xíphos and sft; a general agreement that xiphos is a loan; the archaeological evidence suggesting that swords came to the Aegean from the southeast.19 For these reasons, I am not the only scholar to believe that the phonetic difficulty provided by the Linear B form is far too uncertain to block the thoroughly plausible derivation of xíphos from sft. Bertrand Hemmerdinger is equally unimpressed.20 The derivation of smi—vlh “knife, chisel, surgeon’s scalpel” from smÅ “to kill, destroy illness” was set out in Chapter 15.21 Vycichl is inclined to believe that the Coptic soone, sone (S) soni (B) “brigand” derives from snˆ Coptic sine “to pass, transgress” in the sense of “vagabond.” Sine provides a very plausible etymology for si–vnomai (H) “harm, pillage, devastate.” Sinis was the famous “pine bender” whom Theseus encountered on the Corinthian isthmus.22 As befits a word beginning si-, “obscure” is the word Chantraine uses to describe the etymology of sinomai.



386 BLACK ATHENA
Sdrt “night camp, bivouac” as the origin of the Greek stratov" “military camp” and its many derivatives was discussed in Chapter 12.23
Qn ke@n in Copitic is “to complete, accomplish, perfect, finish off.” It provides a good origin for kainov" (5) “new, of things.” Chantraine distinguishes it from nevo", which can mean “young” of people. On the other hand, he relates kainos to the Sanskrit genitive plural kani]nna\m “of young girls.” Ke\n in the sense of “finish off,” is also a convincing etymon for kaivnw (5) “to kill,” for which Chantraine has no coherent explanation. Qnˆ means, as an adjective, “brave, strong” and, as a verb, “to conquer.” As a noun qn is a “brave man” or a military title. Qnn is “supremacy” and qn(t) “victory, might.” According to the ancients, Ajkovniton, a “poisonous plant,” gained its name from being “without dust, or the sand of an arena” kovni" and, therefore, invincible. Modern scholars disregard this as a folk etymology. I believe that, in the sense of “without antidote,” it makes good sense. Qn provides a reasonable etymology for kaivnumai (H) “to surpass, overcome” and for kaivnw (5) “to kill.” Chantraine provides an explanation for neither of these. Confusion between konis “sand” and qn “ victory” is also shown in the term boukonisthvrion (2CE) “arena for bull fights” (bull against bull). Chantraine is unsure that the word ever existed. There appears to be a Nostratic root *kr found in the Altaic and Uralic *kara “black” and the Indo-European *crowos “crow.” On the basis of
Egyptian and West Chadic, Orel and Stolbova reconstruct a root *qar “cloud.”24 The Egyptian form is qri or qrr, Demotic ql Œl, Coptic, kloole “cloud, storm cloud.” This origin is very probable for kelainov" kerano “black, somber,” said of blood, night or a wave in a storm. Chantraine finds parallels for the suffix -nov" but admits that the radical kelai- is unexplained. He also lacks an etymology for killov", a Dorian term for “gray.” Khlav" (4) is the name of “clouds that foretell wind not rain.” Finally, and this is why these etymologies have been put in this section, qrˆ “storm, thunderbolt” finds a close parallel with kh'la (H) “projectiles launched by the gods Apollo and Zeus.” Chantraine tentatively links it to the Sanskrit s'ara “reed, arrow” and the Middle Irish cail “ lance,” although he admits they each have a short vowel. The Egyptian kÅt “vagina, vulva” sometimes written with the deter
minative P (D3) “braided [African] hair” provides a plausible or rea
sonable etymology for the Greek ko(u)levon (H) “sheath, wool, fur.”



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 387
Koleov" means “sheath” or “vagina” in Modern Greek. Frisk and Chantraine see the words as “Mediterranean.” Kry s=ri is “one of the two kinds of soldiers” in the late period. Demotic
gl-s=r Coptic (L) c=alasi=re. Herodotos used the word kalasivri" to describe members of this military caste.25
The Late Egyptian gÅwt, when written with · (V32) “wickerwork,”
was “bundle.” When written with - (M3) “wood,” it was “box, chest.”
These forms provide a strong etymology for gwru–tov" (H) “container for bows and arrows.” Chantraine believes that it ought to be Scythian but, apart from the Iranian gou “bull,” he and Benveniste, whom he follows, have difficulty with the second half of the word. All they can find is the Old Persian ru\da, Ossetic ru\d “intestines!” Through “gymnastics” we tend to associate gumnov" (H) with strength and endurance. In fact the original meaning was “naked, without clothes, without arms.” Nudity in sport was essential to ensure against the possibility of concealed weapons. A striking parallel to the original sense of gymnos is the Japanese karate “empty hand.” Chantraine writes about the etymology of gymnos: “Old term which is presented in diverse forms in the different Indo-European languages, both because of dissimilation and perhaps the result of a linguistic taboo.” He finds a collection of varied words most of them around the root found in “naked” and beginning with n-. He concludes that the initial g- is unexplained. The Egyptian gnn means “weak, tender.” The phonetic parallel is considerably stronger than any Indo-European competitor, and the semantic one no worse. Tomb paintings show Egyptians practiced wrestling and other forms of unarmed combat.26 Chantraine believes that hjganev" and hjgavneo", which Hesykhios defined as “pure youth” and “youth,” came from different sources. He derives the first from gavnumai “rejoice” and the second from an artificial combination of ajga-, an intensive prefix, and nevo" “young.” It would seem simpler to treat them together and derive both from gnn. The derivation of the name Theseus from the Egyptian tsw “commander, protector of the poor” was set out in Chapter 5.27
The determinative F (T30) appears to be a knife made of metal. It
is, however, employed for ds, which is both “flint” and “knife.” F is also
used for dm “sharp, pierce” and dmt “knife.” This comes from an Afroasiatic root *dam also found in Central Chadic.28 In Chapter 8, I referred to Hesiod’s description, in his Theogony, of Kronos’ castration of Ouranos suggesting that it was carried out with a sickle set with



388 BLACK ATHENA
microliths.29 Some lines earlier Hesiod had been more explicit: “She [Gaia] made an element of grey flint [poliou' adavmanto"] and shaped a great sickle.”30 Chantraine sees adavma" “untamed” as the negative of davmnhmi “tame,” which belongs to the root widespread in Indo-European. In general, however, adamas meant “very sharp, hardest substance,” from which comes the English “diamond.” This fits an etymology from dm far better than from a- damne\mi. Given the Egyptian propensity for prothetic vowels the initial alpha does not present a serious objection. Another plausible derivation from dm is dri–muv" (H) “sharp, piercing acid.”31 Chantraine has no etymology. The Afroasiatic root *dar “drive away” is attested in both Semitic and Egyptian.32 The Egyptian dr has a wide range of meanings: “to subdue, expel, destroy, cast down.” Faulkner gives as a second meaning dr as in “lay down floors, overlay.” Interestingly, Vycichl cites drˆ, a word with this
sense, written with § (E21), the animal of Seth the god of chaos and
destruction but also connected with construction.33 This citation indicates that the second meaning derives from “level” in the sense of total destruction. In any event, dr provides a plausible etymology for dhlevomai (H) “wound, damage, destroy.” Chantraine says “no etymology.” DÅt or drt had a wide range of meanings: “hand, trunk of elephant, handle, shaft? of a chariot.” The Coptic to\re (S) to\ri (B) and tol\i (F) extended the field still further to include “sleeve, dagger, hoe, oar.” Thus, drt provides a reasonable etymology for dovlwn in its two senses, “dagger, bowsprit.” A third meaning “flying jib,” attached to the bowsprit, may have been influenced by another Egyptian term dÅw “mat?” Chantraine points out that, although dolo\n only appears as a word in 2CE, it must be older since a personal name Dolwn is attested earlier. He does not suggest any Indo-European etymology. DÅyw “opponent” and dÅyt “wrongdoing” appear to derive from dÅˆ “cross over water,” in the sense of “transgress.” They provide a good etymology for dhvio" (H) da—vio" (5) as an adjective describing an enemy: “hostile, destructive, savage conduct.” Daios also has connotations of “burning.” The nineteenth-century scholar W. Schulze argued that two different roots were involved.34 Chantraine is not sure but is clear that the words have been influenced by daivw (H) “burn.” Enmity and burning are conceptually easy to confuse. Daio\has a plausible etymology in the Egyptian dÅf Coptic jouf (SB) or qualitative jou (B) “burn.” Chantraine rejects the conventional link to the Sanskrit dunóti “burn.”



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 389
Another cluster of words related to dÅˆ are those around dÅˆs “dispute, argument, civil war.” These provide a possible etymology for dh'ri" (H) “war” and in at least one case, “competition within the family.”35 The difficulty with deriving the Greek word from dÅˆs is that in Homer
it only appears in the accusative dh'rin. Chantraine derives de\ris from an Indo-European root found in the Sanskrit -dari- “who separates.” Nevertheless, the Egyptian etymology from dÅˆs with its strong semantic parallels should not be discarded. With the nominal suffix -w, dÅˆsw meant “disputant.” This could well be the origin of the first element of Qersivth" who challenged the chiefs at the siege of Troy and was put down so brutally by Odysseus.36 Given the context, the etymology is certainly better than devised by Robert Graves: “son of courage.” In Egyptian dÅmw were “young men, troops.” This provides a reasonable etymology for tovlmh (6) “brave, audacious.” Chantraine reports on previous structural analyses of the word. Neither he nor any of his predecessors can find any Indo-European cognates.
Semitic vocabulary
In Semitic a number of onomatopoeic words exist based on the roots √>lh and √hll with a basic sense of “cry aloud, ululate” or in European languages alleluia. In Hebrew >ålåh can mean “curse, wail.” The Akkadian alâlu and the Arabic hal mean “shout in joy” though the latter may also be “cry in terror.” The Greek ajlalav (6) is “violent cry” particularly “war cry,” sometimes also of anguish. Jane Harrison argued that such cries are “beyond articulate speech.”37 Chantraine agrees that it may well be the case not only for alala and what seems to be a derivative ajlavlugx “sob, cry” but also for ojloluvzw (H) and ejleleu' (5). The pattern V1l V1lV1 is undoubtedly widespread; Chantraine has found a parallel for alala in Sanskrit. Nevertheless, it is not universal and borrowing into Greek from Semitic here cannot be ruled out. The Semitic name, Aramu, in Akkadian and >A+råm in Hebrew may well be the origin of the Egyptian ŒÅm “Asiatic.”38 It referred to the land, much of it desert in what are now northern Iraq and Syria as well as to its people >A+ramî. In Greek, ejrh'mo" (H) “solitary, of peoples and places, desert.” Chantraine’s comment on the etymology is “nothing clear.” Chantraine explains ejnophv (H) “cry of warriors,” later “combat.” as coming from *ejn- ̧op-hvfrom a root *wekw related to e[po" “word.” It would



390 BLACK ATHENA
seem simpler to derive it from the Semitic √>np “be angry” Arabic >anifa and the Hebrew infinitive construct >e=nop. Oswald Szemerényi has proposed that the Greek ajphvnh (H) “fourwheeled cart” derived from a West Semitic form found in the Ugaritic >apnm “two-wheeled cart.”39 This seems very likely. He also sees another derivation of the same root as the origin of lamphvnh (5) “covered wagon or chariot.” This derivation requires hypothesizing a form with the common preformative m- *m>apn and from *mappen> *nappen> *nampen to *lampen.40 Although clumsy, this is still possible. Chantraine recognizes the similarity between ape\ne\and lampe\ne\ but cannot explain either. The basic meaning of √>pn appears to be “wheel, turn,” a good etymology for phvnh (H) “bobbin, spool.” Chantraine rejects previous attempts to attach it to an Indo-European root. He attaches it to phnhvkh (H) “a kind of wig.” The connection between wigs and spinning is common in many cultures: Sir Toby Belch described the hair of his friend Sir Andrew Aguecheek: “it hangs like flax on a distaff.”41 The Afroasiatic root *>arVh°signifies a “kind of cattle.”42 In Ugaritic >arh°and in Akkadian arh°u mean “wild cow, heifer.” This is linked to the Akkadian >arâh°u “be quick, hasten,” and ereh°u “advance.” The Canaanite verb >rh≥ in the Hebrew root >årah≥ “wander, journey go,” imperfect ye>e=roh≥.43 A West Semitic member of this cluster seems an obvious source of the Greek e[rcomai (H) “to come, go, march.”44 The verb is odd in that it only possessed a present theme where it replaced the IndoEuropean ei\mi. This fact in itself suggests a loan. Chantraine considers some Indo-European etymologies for erkhomai but states “no assured etymology.” Another plausible loan from √>rh°is the extraordinarily productive stem arc- “Arcw (H) “to march in front, be the first, begin.” From this ajrc developed the meanings of “chief, commander” and ajrc ai``o" became “ancient, original.” These fruitful semantic extensions appear to have taken place within Greek. Nevertheless, the original source of ajrc- seems to have been the African heifer. Chantraine contents himself with denouncing the “valueless hypotheses” of Boisacq and Schwyzer. He makes no positive suggestions. The pan-Semitic root √>rk is found in the Akkadian arâku, the Ugaritic >ark or >urk and the South Arabian >rk and the Hebrew >årak or >årêk. It means “long” and almost always applies to time: “to last, survive, endure.”45 The basic senses of the Greek ajrkevw are “to protect and suf



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 391
fice.” But also, at least among the tragedians, arkeo\was also used to convey “holding out, enduring.” Could this have been the earlier meaning? Chantraine associates arkeo\with the Latin arx, “acropolis” and arceo\“contain, maintain.” Ernout and Meillet believe that arx might well be a loan word. Even so, they follow Pokorny in seeing arceo\as belonging to an Indo-European family exemplified in the Armenian argel “prevention.” Chantraine is skeptical of this. Thus, a Semitic etymology from ->rk remains a reasonable possibility. In Arabic the root √>rt is found in >rt “to sow dissension” >irt “ashes” and >aratta “to light a fire, provoke war.” In the Eritrean language of Tigre >arta is to “be excited.” There are also other versions, for example, with /s=/ such as >aras=a “to stir up a fire, sow discord” and >ars=“indemnity, money for the shedding of blood.” These were possibly borrowed from Canaanite and /t/ shifted to /s=/.46 Such a Canaanite form would provide a good origin for e[ri" (H) “quarrel, rivalry, ardor in combat.” Frisk refers to previous hypotheses as “very questionable.” Chantraine simply states “no etymology.” Orel and Stolbova, propose a root *bel “weapon” for Afroasiatic but they do not include a Semitic form.47 In 1967 Maria Luisa Mayer claimed that the Greek bevlo" (H) “missile, projectile” derived from the NeoAssyrian and Babylonian Akkadian belu “weapon.”48 Chantraine, on the other hand, subsumes belos under bavllw “to throw, place.” The existence of an Arcadian form devllw leads him to propose an original form *gwelE with a labiovelar. He relates this to the Avestan ni-gra\-ire “they are beaten,” Tocharian kla\- “fall.” These are not very impressive. On the other hand, belos fits well with ballo\and belu. It is unlikely to have originated the whole Greek cluster. Thus the parallel could either be a random coincidence or the result of a convergence from the two sources. The etymology of bavri" “estate, great and fortified house” from the Egyptian pr with the same meanings was discussed in Chapter 9.49 In Gesenius’s dictionary the late Hebrew word biråh “castle, palace” and the Akkadian bîrtu “fortress” are supposed to be borrowings from IndoEuropean, the Iranian bâru and the Sanskrit bura or bari. Ellenbogen denies this.50 Buvrsa, although best known as a place-name for the citadel of Carthage was, as Muss-Arnolt pointed out, also used in Athens.51 The legend of Dido’s using strips of ox hide, byrsa, to claim more territory is clearly a folk etymology to explain a foreign, almost certainly Canaanite, word. Despite the difficulty in explaining the final -sa, this is likely to be related to biråh or bîrtu.



392 BLACK ATHENA
Afroasiatic contains a root *gabar “male.”52 The Hebrew segolate geber comes from a general Semitic *gabr. Its meaning was extended to convey “strong, mighty.” The Akkadian gabru meant “rival.” In Arabic jabbarwas “giant, colossus, almighty.” The Hebrew verb gåbar is “to be strong or mighty” and the noun gibôr is “a strong and valiant man.” Despite the pattern that most specifically Spartan terms derive from Egyptian, not Semitic, whatever the vocalization, the root √gbr provides a reasonable etymology for the Laconian term kabbalikov" “fighter.” Chantraine derives this from a hypothetical *katabaliko" “able to throw to the ground.” This is possible but unlikely. The root √gdl “great” appears in Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew. With the nominal preformative m-, migdål is “tower.” The Greek mavgdwlo" (3) is “guard tower.” Chantraine and other lexicographers agree that this derives from Semitic. Oswald Szemerényi points out that the Hebrew gElo\m “wrapping garment” provides a good etymology for the Greek clamuv" (6) “coat, especially miltary.”53 Chantraine describes this hypothesis as “fragile,” while admitting that khlamys and similar words are of “unknown origin.” The Canaanite zåram is “to pour forth in floods” and zerem< *zarm was a mountain rainstorm dashing against a wall. In Akkadian zaråmu was “overwhelm.” This Semitic source explains the main element in ejpizarevw (5) “to attack, swoop down on.” Chantraine rejects a previous attempt to find an Indo-European etymology, concluding simply “unknown.” The well-known Arabic h≥ajj is a “sacred journey, pilgrimage,” and the Sabaean h≥gg is a verb “to make a pilgrimage.” The Sabaean h≥g was “pilgrimage.” The Hebrew h≥ag is a “festival, pilgrim feast.” The root h≥jj in Arabic has another aspect: “to defeat, overcome, convince or be a competent authority.” This meaning may explain a Hebrew form h≥åggå > found in the Book of Isaiah in which “the land of Judah will be to Egypt as a h≥åggå >.”54 The Authorized Version translates it as a “reeling” and the New English Bible as a “terror.” Could it possibly be as a “leader”? The Greek hJgevomai (H), from which hJgemwvn, is “to march in front, guide, lead.” Ernout and Meillet relate he\geomai to a root *sa\g or *sEg found in the Latin sagio “to know the future,” the Hittite s=akiya “to show the signs” and the Irish saigim “to seek, search.” These clearly form an Indo-European word family but does he\geomai belong to it? Neither the Indo-European nor the Semitic candidate is semantically strong, but the latter remains a strong possibility. The etymology of ai|ma (H) “blood, spirit, courage,” from the



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 393
Canaanite h≥ayyîm “life [with connotations of blood]” was discussed in Chapter 14.55 In Arabic hama\or hamy means “to protect, guard.” In Akkadian emu meant “to surround, guard.” In Ugaritic hm`y, hm`t and in the Phoenician plural h`myt, all signified “wall.” The Hebrew hô`måh is “wall as protec
tion.” The Greek aiJmasiav (H) meant “enclosure, dry stone, brick wall.” Chantraine writes, “It would be surprising if a word of this type had a certain Indo-European etymology.” While the usual way in which a Semitic or Egyptian /h/` was rendered in Greek was as /h/, it could also come out as /kh/. Thus it is not surprising to find a noun cw'ma (5) “dune, terrace, dike” and the verb cwvnnnu–mi (5) “pile up, terrace.” Chantraine has no coherent etymology for this word.56 The root √h°nh is “to bend down, encamp” and the common placename Mh°nm in Ugaritic and Mah≥a=nayîm in Hebrew means “two camps.” In Volume 1 and elsewhere, I have discussed the derivation of the name Mukh'nai from this root.57 Karl Brugmann argued that when the breathing was on the initialas in ojistov" (H) “arrow”—oi- was not a diphthong but a prefixed o(which he did not explain). He, therefore, related it to the Sanskrit isy`ati, “set in motion” and the Greek i———–ov" “arrow.”58 His case is somewhat weakened by the fact that in Attic Greek the accentuation was oijstov". In contrast to Brugmann, as indicated in earlier chapters, I am inclined to see -oi- in Greek as an indication of a borrowing from a word containing a rounded consonant Cw.59 In this case, it is likely that the Arabic h≥azw`a “small arrow,” the Ugaritic hz``and the Hebrew hê`si`or h≥is “arrow” derive from an earlier *h≥Wez`or *h≥Wes.`This hypothesis is strengthened by the Akkadian form uss`u`. Paul Lagarde proposed deriving oistos from h≥is, but Lewy rejected this proposal on the grounds later taken up by Brugmann.60 Chantraine does not challenge Brugmann but concludes the section on oistos: “it could also be an arrangement of a loanword.” The complications of this etymology are compounded not only by the presence of ios “arrow” but also by oi|stro" (H) “ goad, prick, sting.” Chantraine compares it to the Lithuanian aistrà “violent passion.” The striking similarity of phonetics and semantics makes it simpler to relate it to oistos. Another word that is almost certainly related is ajiv?ssw (H) “shoot, dart.” Chantraine describes this etymology as “uncertain.” He rejects on both phonetic and semantic grounds any connection to the Sanskrit vevijyáte “to withdraw” and for phonetic reasons, although the



394 BLACK ATHENA
semantic parallels are good, connections with aijolo" “lively, rapid” said of wasps and horseflies. To conclude it seems reasonable to cluster oistos, oistros and aisso\ and to derive them all from *h≥Wes.` Objections to the derivation of the Greek a{rph from the Semitic root √h≥rb “sword” were discussed in Chapter 8.61 Although Orel and Stolbova did not mention it as an Afroasiatic root, Egyptian and Semitic clearly shared a root √h≥/h°rb for the fundamental tool in harvesting: the sickle. The natural predecessor of this implement was the animal jawbone, and
a survival can be seen in the doubled determinative  ̨ (F19) used
for the Egyptian h°Åbb or hÅbb “crookedness,” a word clearly related to hÅb “sickle.”62 The relationship between harvesting and slaughtering enemies is obvious in many cultures, from Samson’s boast “with a jawbone of an ass I have slain a thousand men” to Cromwell’s “God made them as stubble to our swords.”63 Thus, it is not surprising to find the Semitic root √h≥rb “sword” and the Hebrew verb h≥årab “to attack, smite down” also found in the Arabic h≥araba. This may well have been confused with √h≥rb<√h°rb, and the verb h≥årêb Arabic h°ariba Akkadian h°arâbu “dry, waste, laid waste.” These two sources combined in the Canaanite √h≥rb provide a plausible etymology for aJrpavzw (H) “to plunder, attack, rape.” In 1981 Oswald Szemerényi proposed that the Greek rJomfaiva (3) “large sword” also derives from this root.64 Chantraine sees parallels for the ending -aia but thinks that this word, too, could be a borrowing. I have discussed the derivation of the Greek a{rma (H) “chariot” from the Semitic root √h≥rm elsewhere.65 In addition, this was mentioned in Chapter 3 and I shall return to it in Chapter 21.66 In the hiphil, a causative verb type, the root √t>wl is “to cast down.” In its passive counterpart the hophal is “to be cast down, overwhelmed.” With a final -m Hebrew and Aramaic √tl`m(<√zl`m as in Arabic?) and Geæez √tl`m all mean “to oppress, injure.” Chantraine has no etymology for qlavw (H) “to murder, crush.” An origin from √tl`m is quite probable. The disappearance of the final -m can be explained as its having been interpreted as morphologically from the infinitive thlân or the first person plural thlaomen. Directly or indirectly √tl`m may also be the etymon of qli–vbw (H) “to oppress, overcome.” Chantraine sees it as a cross between thlao\fli–vbw “to crush, oppress.” There is, indeed, a striking similarity in both sound and meaning between the two verbs, which indicates some connection. The direction of influence is, however, less easy to determine. Phlibo\has no clear Indo-European etymology and could have been formed by analogy with thlibo\.



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 395
In Chapter 4, I noted Gamkredlidze and Ivanov’s proposal that the PIE *k[ho]r(e)i “to buy, trade, barter” derived from Semitic. More specific borrowings also appear to have come from West Semitic into Greek. The Hebrew kåråh “to get by trade, trade” and the Arabic kariya “to let out, hire” provide good etymologies for the root of ejpivkouro" (4) “auxiliary mercenary” and karovw (6CE) in the sense of “to buy, bargain.” The more common meaning of karovw (4) “to be drunk out of one’s mind,” appears to derive from kåråh “to give a feast.” None of the Greek words has an Indo-European etymology. While Orel and Stolbova do not list it as an Afroasiatic root, the biliteral √mh°“confront, fight” is widespread in both Semitic and Egyptian. In Chapter 8 I mentioned the derivation of movclo" “lever” from the Egyptian mh°Åt “balance.”67 Mh°Åt itself came from mh°Å “to match, equal, be like.” The Canaanite √mh≥r<mh°r, as in the Akkadian mah°âru, means “in front of.” I proposed this as the etymon for mevcri (H) “upto” in Volume 1.68 The Hebrew måh≤å> is “to clap hands.” Other derivations of mh°are more confrontational: måh≥åh “to strike, wipe out,” the Akkadian mah°u “to crush, oppress,” måh°âsù “to smite through, wound, shatter.” Finally, there is måh≥aq “ to destroy utterly, annihilate.” Mavcomai (H) “combat, battle” has no established Indo-European etymology. Chantraine is skeptical of connections with a hypothetical Iranian *ha-mazan “warrior” reconstructed from ∆Amazwvn or with mavcaira “dagger.” The relationship between the Hebrew m ́keråh “weapon” and makhaira was discussed in Chapter 7.69 All in all, there seems no reason to doubt a Semitic origin for makhomai. The root √mrd “rebel” is widespread among Semitic languages. The Arabic marada is “bold and audacious rebellion” but mard is an apostate from Islam. In Hebrew mårad is “to rebel” against God or a king, and mered is “rebellion.” The Greek ajmevrdw (H) was “to deprive” notably of what is legitimate. It has no assured Indo-European etymology. Thus, despite the difficulty of the prothetic alpha the Semitic origin is clear.70 The Arabic naky is “to be defeated” nika>ya is “inflicting of injury.” In Hebrew ˆnåkåh is “to smite” in the passive or niphal perfect it is nikkåh. Chantraine considers the etymology of nei'ko" (H) “dispute, battle” uncertain. He is skeptical of attempts to link it to the Latvian nikns “bad, violent” and of Pokorny’s linking it to niv—kh (H) “victory.”71 Despite both semantic and phonetic imprecisions and difficulties in the absence of Indo-European competition a derivation of neikos from Semitic seems quite possible.



396 BLACK ATHENA
The Semitic root √<zz occurs in many languages: Arabic <azza and <izza “to be strong powerful”; Akkadian ezezu, ezzu “fierce, furious”; the Ugaritic and Phoenician <z and the Hebrew <åzaz, <az, <oz <e\zuz all meaning “strong, fierce.” These provide an excellent etymology for the Homeric aijzhov" “vigor, physical strength and courage, in a hunter or warrior.” Chantraine states that the origin of the word is unknown. Orel and Stolbova find a Proto-Afroasiatic root *pal “cut, split.”72 The -pl- in “split, divide” has cognates in both Arabic and Aramaic. In Geæez fälägi>is “ravine, stream” and the Akkadian palgu is “canal.” Bomhard constructs *p[h]ily - *p[h]ey for Nostratic.73 The lateral fricative/Ò/ and its ramifications as /s/ or /l/ were discussed in Chapter 13, and evidence
from both Semitic and Egyptian suggest that the original form was *paÒ.74 In Arabic, fala> and in Hebrew pålåh are “to be separated, distinct.” In
both language families additions were made to the biliteral *pÒ. Hebrew pålah≥, Arabic falah≥a are “to cleave.” One such extension of √plq was discussed in Chapter 4 when I considered the loan of a Semitic form found in the Akkadian pilaqqu “ax” into PIE.75 The extension considered here is √pÒg. The Hebrew pålag “split divide” has cognates in both Arabic and Aramaic. In Geæez fälägï is “ravine, stream” and the Akkadian palgu is “canal.” In Chapter 8, I suggested that the Egyptian tÅs=“boundary, canal” should be seen as the etymon of thalassa “sea.”76 Here, I accept the proposal of Muss-Arnolt that a vocalization of √plg was the origin of the pevlago" (H) the next most frequently used Greek term for “sea.” Chantraine considers linking pelagos to plavgio" “oblique” and, hence, to the Latin pla\ga “wide space.” but he, Ernout and Meillet are all skeptical of the connection. The best Chantraine can come up with is a hypothetical root *polE “flat, space.” Many scholars have studied, and speculated on, the obvious relation
ship between the Hebrew pil±eges ̈ and Greek pallakhv or pallakiv" (H) both meaning “concubine.”77 Chaim Rabin saw it as an IndoEuropean loan into Hebrew.78 John Pairman Brown sees it as from Anatolia, Hittite or Luvian.79 Saul Levin demonstrated that it could not regularly be Greek and speculated that it came from the Indo-European Messapic language of Apulia and Albania (about which very little is known) and, further, that it passed through some “unknown non-IndoEuropean language of the Aegean” before arriving in both Greek and Hebrew.80 The Hebrew phonetics are undoubtedly irregular and this may reflect borrowing to and from another language. Nevertheless, the



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 397
structure p-l-g and the sense of the concubine as someone “cut off ” or “apart” fit very well with the cluster around the biliteral √pl. In Egyptian pngÅ<*plg, Coptic pol\c=(S) and phol\c=(B) when written with
the determinatives F (T30) and  ̊ (D40) (“strong arm”) meant “to
separate, decide, liberate, terminate and die.” They all suggest “cutting with a knife.”81 The other reflex of √pÒg is √psg. In Egyptian pss= is “to divide, division.”82 Ps=n was “to split, separate.” In the Bible påsag is “to pass between.” In later Hebrew it is used in the sense of “to split, cut off.” The antiquity of this meaning is confirmed by the place-name Pisgåh, a mountain whose striking natural feature is a cleft. The Greek favsganon (M) “sword” almost certainly belongs to this cluster with an original sense of “cleaver.”83 Chantraine points out the suffix -anon is used for instruments. He rejects an origin from sfavzw “to cut the throat of ” and cognicity with the Sanskrit khadg`a “sword.”84 He is left with the hypothesis of borrowing and refers to the proposal of Umberto Rapallo who saw it as coming from the Semitic √psg.85 Rapallo maintained that √psg derived from a root √ptg attested in Aramaic and Arabic. This would have led to a Canaanite **√ps=g The difficulty with this is not that such a form is not attested (there is none for √ps;g either) as much as that/s=/ did not merge with /s/ but /s;/ did. While in Phoenician /s;/ merged with /s=/, in Hebrew the merge was with/s/. See for instance the biblical pås;åh “spread” and the later form påsåh, as well as pås;aq, “open wide” and the later påsaq “to cut, sever, cleave.” Thus, while it is clear that phasganon derived from √psg, it is extremely likely that √psg itself was originally *ps;g and ultimately √pÒg. Kanadovka is a Laconian name for the “notches in an arrow.” Chantraine derives the first part from kavnna “reed.” For the Semitic origin of this, see Chapter 17.86 In 1928 Heinrich Lewy proposed that the Homeric hapax katai'tux “leather helmet with no crest or plumes” could be derived from the Semitic root √qtt`.`87 The Arabic qatt``is “to cut, cut off, pare, trim.” and
the Hebrew qot`is assumed to be related to it. Chantraine seriously considers this possibility. There is an obscure cluster of Greek words: kosuvmbh “shepherd’s coat,” kossuvmbh “hair net,” kovtqubo" “element of military equipment.” Chantraine writes of the first two that they give the impression of a fringe or a coat with a fringe. The medial consonants suggest



398 BLACK ATHENA
uncertain borrowings from a Semitic tsade /s/`. Indeed a root is found in Arabic, Aramaic and New Hebrew √qsb`“to cut off, shear [shorn sheep].” In Late Hebrew one finds the expression qisb`ê hårîm. The meaning of qisb`ê has been translated variously as “extremities, bottoms, troughs, roots” of mountains.88 Given the association of the root √qsb`with “shearing,” “fringes of the mountains,” seems a better translation. Thus a pas
sive participle *qåsu`b would provide a plausible origin for the three Greek words Chantraine sees as “without etymology.” The common Semitic root √r>s “head, chief ” occurs in Arabic as ra>s, in Akkadian as rêsu, Ugaritic as r>is, in Hebrew as ro>s= and Western Phoenician or Punic as rus. The meaning of the Greek word rJhsov" (5) is uncertain. The consensus, however, is that it is that of ajrco" “leader.” In that case it would be an old loan introduced from the archaic ra>s and going through the sound shift a\>e.\ The Canaanite √s;bk was to “interweave” and s; ́båkå “lattice work, network” In Greek sambuvkh (4) was (1) a triangular harp with four strings and (2) a siege engine, presumably with a similar shape. Given the initial s- and the many Greek names for musical instruments with Semitic etymologies, Chantraine sees it as a “certain” oriental borrowing, but he refers to E. Masson’s niggling objections to the previous Semitic etymologies.89 In Chapter 13 I discussed the Semitic etymologies of the cluster with such words as sulavw and skuvla “to despoil, strip, plunder.”90
Conclusion
In 1970, the Italian scholar Umberto Rapallo stated, “None of the names by which Homer designates a ‘sword,’ favsganon, xivfo", a[or, mavcaira have secure connections with other Indo-European languages.”91 He wrote this having made a strong case for a Semitic origin for phasganon and an approving reference to the conventional Egyptian etymology for xiphos. Aor too has a possible Egyptian derivation.92 The complications with makhaira and its ultimately Egyptian origin are discussed in Chapter 7.93 Thus the Homeric terminology of the sword is not merely nonIndo-European but very largely, if not exclusively, Afroasiatic. The same may well be true of harpe\“sickle and scimiter” found in Hesiod.94 This is significant because the sword was a new “wonder weapon” of the Late Bronze Age. While earlier heroes like Herakles wielded a club, those who came later, notably Theseus, made great play of gaining and using



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 399
a sword against enemies who lacked one.95 These legends are represented pictorially by a Pylos mural of men wearing kilts, greaves and Mycenaean helmets, carrying swords and attacking people who are dressed in skins and nearly all unarmed.96 The terminology of the chariot, the other wonder weapon of the Late Bronze Age, has fewer clearly Afroasiatic elements. The possibility that harma “chariot” derives from Semitic or Egyptian will be discussed in Chapter 21.97 I treated the derivation heteros, associated with the two men in the chariot, from the Egyptian h≥tr in Chapter 12.98 The origin of other terminology regarding horses and chariots is less clear-cut. It may well be that the development of chariots in north Syria by an Indo-Aryanspeaking warrior class has left traces in Greek.99 The most important single military stem in Greek is stratos “camp” with its many ramifications; it clearly derives from the Egyptian sdrt.100 The developments of erkhomai “march” and arkho\ “head a march” from the root √>rh°provide just two of the many important Semitic influences on the Greek military vocabulary. At the beginning of this chapter I discussed what I saw as the two major modes by which military language can be transmitted. The first was through conquest and the second was through reputation for superior military technology or organization. The saturation of Greek by Egyptian and West Semitic in this semantic area does not require the first mode, though it certainly allows for it. It does, however, necessitate the second and this should not surprise us, given what we know, through documents and archaeology of the Second Millennium BCE, about the relative development of wealth, power and material culture in Syria and Egypt as opposed to the Aegean.
SHIPPING
In Volume 2 I referred to the balance of wealth shifting from the large wheat-growing plains of northern Greece to the coasts and islands of the south and east. This change took place during the Neolithic in the Fifth or Fourth Millenia BCE.101 Since then Greek civilization has been closely connected to, and dependent on, the sea. One would expect, therefore, a large and sensitively mapped vocabulary in this semantic region. Take, for example, the many Greek words for “sea”: qavlassa, pevlago", povnto", Wkeanov" and a{l". Arguments that thalassa and pelagos derive respectively from Egyptian and Semitic words for canal have



400 BLACK ATHENA
already been given in this volume.102 For peoples linked by the water the image of the sea as a barrier is somewhat paradoxical but the idea becomes evident in the plausible derivation of ijsqmov" (H) “isthmus, neck” from sdmˆ “attachment.”103 In Volume 2, I proposed that pontos derived from the Egyptian Pwnt “distant land to the north and south and the sea to be crossed to reach it.”104 In the same volume, I considered Michael Astour’s suggestion that Ok|eanos was constructed from the Sumerian *A ki an “water of land and heaven.”105 The only synonym with a clear Indo-European etymology is hals from the root *sal “salty.” Greek, like Armenian and Indo-Aryan, lacks the root *mar/mor “sea, stretch of water” found in Latin, Celtic, Germanic and Balto-Slav. Altogether, it is striking that both the richness of the Greek vocabulary of the sea and the most frequently used terms for it can be plausibly derived from Afroasiatic. The number of Greek navigational terms with plausible Afroasiatic origins is also impressive. I shall begin with the Egyptian proposals.
Egyptian vocabulary
C+erny and Vycichl agree on a sequence from bnyt “lower millstone” through *ebni±yet> *ewni±yet to the Coptic euni. From this they derive the Greek eujnh (H) “bed” but also “stone, anchor” a large stone with a hole through which it can be attached to a ship. The young Adolph Erman allowed only one exception to his blanket denial of Egyptian loan words in Greek: the derivation of ba'ri" (5) “flat-bottomed ship used in Egypt” from the Late Egyptian and Ugaritic br “coaster, ship” baare in Coptic.106 No subsequent scholar has challenged this. The derivation of pruvmnh (H) “poop” from *pÅ rmn was discussed in Chapter 9.107 Sdmˆ, the causative of dmˆ “to be joined” as “attachment” has been mentioned above in connection to isthmos. In addition, *pÅ sdmˆ “the attachment” makes a plausible etymon for pei'sma (H) “maritime cord, cordage” and peismavtion “umbilical cord.” Chantraine confidently reconstructs a form *penqsma that he links to the Sanskrit badhna\mi, Gothic bindan. This stretch is made even less plausible by the incongruency of the initial labials. Ptakavna (2CE) was “a mat used on boats.” Pollux the Sophist from Naukratis wrote that it was the same as kavnna “reed.”108 Even E. Masson



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 401
accepts that kanna derives from a Canaanite qåneh “reed.” Two steps are needed to accept a derivation from *pÅ knh: first that qåneh was adopted from Semitic into Egyptian, and second that one can ignore the frequent alternation between initial p- and pt- in Greek. Neither of these barriers seem very substantial. In modern Egyptian Arabic ru\mis is “a raft made of jars.” It comes from the Coptic rams and the Demotic rms. Jaroslav C+erny maintained that this form derived from the Greek rJwy, rJwmsin. All other scholars reverse the direction.109 The Egyptian hŒ°w has a wide range of meanings: “weapons, furniture, ship’s tackle, utensils.” In Late Egyptian the field even included “basket, bucket.” The semantics of the Greek skeu'o" (5) are remarkably close: “recepticle, utensil.” In the plural skeu'h is “utensils, of all sorts: for the house, culture, baggage, equipment and navigation.” For correspondences of Egyptian /h°/with Greek /sk/, see Chapter 8.110 Chantraine denies all previous attempts and simply states that skeuos is without an etymology. The derivation of sou'son “ropes, cordage” from ss=nw “ropes, cordage” was discussed in the last chapter.111 In 1955 Cyrus Gordon proposed the Egyptian sqtt/w a “kind of boat” as the origin of a[kato" a “rapid light boat.” Szemerényi came to the same conclusion almost twenty years later.112 Chantraine speculates that it might be a loan. S+dw “rafts” provides a good etymology for scediva (H) “raft.” Chantraine associates it with the all-purpose e[scon “I held.”
I[kria (H) “scaffolding on fore and aft decks” and ka'lon “inferior boat” in the Laconian dialect can both be plausibly derived from kÅi “boat of Nubian type?” The derivation of topei'a (3) “cordage” from tpt “cord, thread” will be discussed in Chapter 17.113 Travmpi" (3) “barbarian boat” would seem to derive from the Egyptian  ̈tÅb “vessel or bowl”; see Chapter 15. The origins of the Greek Dovlwn “bowsprit, foresail” from the Egyptian dÅt/ drt were discussed above.
Semitic vocabulary
It has long been seen that the Greek ojqovnh (H) “fine linen, sails” derived from the Semitic >e–t`u–n “thread, yarn, fine cloth.” Additional



402 BLACK ATHENA
meanings included “rope, cord” in Late Hebrew. In 1907 W. Spiegelberg proposed that >et\u`\n itself derived from the Egyptian idmi “red linen.”114 The lexicographers of Greek, including E. Masson, all accept this sequence.115 In Chapter 5, I discussed the transfer of the Canaanite city name *Gwebl or *Gwibl to the Greek Biblos or Byblos.116 The word buvblino" “ship’s cable made of papyrus” appears in the Odyssey.117 Orel and Stolbova propose two Afroasiatic roots *gulul. One translates as “ball” and the other as “vessel.”118 In Semitic the latter is found in the Akkadian gullu “round basin,” Ugaritic gl “cup” and the Hebrew gullåh.119 It is generally agreed that the Greek gaulov" (5) “vessel, bowl” derives from this form. Chantraine agrees that it is possible that gau'lo" “a type of ship” is related to gaulov". He refers to Hesykhios’ having written: “they call Phoenician boats gau'loi.” Chantraine continues: “this should not necessarily encourage one to look with Lewy for a Phoenician or Semitic etymology.”120 Chantraine prefers to associate gau'lo" with the Old High German kiol “vessel” and the Greek gwleov" “cave, hole, lair” and guvalon “cup.” Conventional scholars have linked gole–os to the Lithuanian guôlis “lair, nest.” This may be the case for cups and potholes are linked semantically. Given the clear association of both gaulov" and gau'lo" with Semitic, it would seem reasonable to consider an Afroasiatic source for gol\eos and gualon. In fact two Afroasiatic roots exist and provide perfect phonetic and reasonable semantic prototypes: *gol/gwal “be round, vagina.”121 A relationship between these and gulul would be neatly paralleled by the Egyptian derivations of the root *qd meaning “circle, pot.”122 Thus gol\eos and gualon have possible roots in both Afroasiatic and IndoEuropean. It is unclear which is the more likely. The willingness to accept a Semitic origin for gaulov" “bowl” while balking at gau'lo" “boat” parallels the acceptance of the Egyptian derivation souson “lily” and rejection of one for souson “ships’ cordage.” Once again this illustrates the ideological constraints under which the etymological lexicographers have been laboring. The pan-Semitic root √kbr has many vocalizations, including kabâru “great mighty” in Akkadian and kabı\:r with the same meaning in Arabic and Hebrew. The well-known derivation from this of the Kabiroi/Cabiri has been discussed in earlier volumes.123 Among the many Arabic forms, there is kubra\“larger, older, senior ranking.” According to Chantraine, the Greek kubernavw (H) “to steer a boat, drive a chariot” has “no etymology and one supposes a loan.” Many derivatives—kubernhthvr (H)



[CH. 16] WARFARE, HUNTING AND SHIPPING 403
“helmsman,” kubernh`ti" “an epithet of Isis” and kubernhvsia “festival of ships captains”—point to “larger, older, senior ranking” and the sense of the Latin guberno\ “to steer, govern” borrowed from the Greek. An analogy for this is the development of “captain” from caput “head.” Given the semantic fit, the lack of an Indo-European competitor and the propensity of both Afroasiatic and Indo-European not to contain words with more than three consonants [unless the result of reduplication], I believe it is justifiable to see the /n/ merely as a suffix. Szemerényi made the plausible proposal that a Canaanite version of the Akkadian term, also found at Ugarit eleppu “light type of boat” is the origin of levmbo" (2) “canoe, small boat.”124 Chantraine states “no etymology, perhaps borrowed.” In Chapter 7, the Semitic root √mlh≥, in Canaanite “salt,” was mentioned in connection with the Greek malakhe\and the Latin malua “mallow.”125 In the sense of “an old salt,” it is found in the Akkadian mala\h°u Hebrew mallå h°“sailor.” Chantraine denies the gloss given by the lexicographer Hesykhios that malath're" meant “sailors.” Szemerényi backs the ancient writer against Chantraine and plausibly proposes that the word should be derived from Semitic.126 Szemerényi drew the obvious conclusion that saghvnh (4) “large net” derived from a Semitic form also found in the Akkadian sikinnu “large net.”127 Chantraine denied this on the grounds that “it is almost certainly a technical term from the substrate like ajphvnh etc.” Szemerényi’s argument for a Semitic origin for ape\ne\ was given earlier in this chapter.128 Apart from Chantraine’s curious dismissal of such a clear semantic and phonetic parallel, it is difficult to see how a term from the substrate could have retained its initial s- after the shift s>h. The root √sbl appears in the Akkadian sûbultu “to cause to hang down,” the Arabic sabala with the same meaning plus “to let fall,” the Ugaritic sblt and the Hebrew si=bol\et “flowing stream, ear of grain” [hanging down?]. Saying shiboleth/siboleth was, of course, the test of dialect.129 The sense of hanging down would fit the meaning of ajspalieuv" (3) “fisherman using line.” The prothetic vowel would shield the double consonant. For Chantraine, the etymology is obscure but could be Mediterranean. Chantraine states that sivfaro" (3) “sail hoisted in calms” is a “technical term without an etymology.” By this he merely means an IndoEuropean etymology, because he also writes, “a plausible loan.” He goes on to suggest a Semitic source from the Akkadian suparruru “to spread out” of a pavilion or canopy. I see no reason to doubt this.



404 BLACK ATHENA
Conclusion
In Chapter 4, we looked at a number of proposals for an Afroasiatic origin for the PIE *naHw- “ship, vessel.”130 None of the claims here for Egyptian or Semitic loans into Greek are as fundamental. Most are either special types of boats or equipment, usually sails, because of the high quality of textiles used in Egypt and the Levant for ropes and hausers. The latter are not surprising given the huge reed and papyrus marshes of the Nile Delta. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the Afroasiatic nautical vocabulary in Greek confirms what we know from archaeology and iconography: Greek navigation was a thoroughly cosmopolitan affair.

CHAPTER 17
SEMANTIC CLUSTERS:
SOCIETY, POLITICS, LAW AND ABSTRACTION
INTRODUCTION
This chapter is concerned with what in modern universities are considered the social sciences: Society, politics, law and abstraction. Greek civilization has generally been accepted, at least by Western cultures, as preeminent in these semantic areas. The number of aspects of these topics in which modern European languages draw upon Greek vocabulary is illustrative of this acceptance. Therefore, it is particularly interesting to see that many such terms that are familiar to non-Greek speakers ultimately have Afroasiatic origins.
SOCIETY
Introduction
In some ways this section can be seen as a “grab bag,” that is to say, a list of etymologies that cannot be fitted into other sections. On the other hand, its broad range illustrates the number of aspects of Greek society that have been directly or indirectly affected by speakers of Afroasiatic languages.



406 BLACK ATHENA
Egyptian vocabulary
First in our Egyptian words is ˆp(Å)t, the name of the harem. The Greek ajpavth (H) is “trickery, ruse, artifice” and later attested as “pastime, pleasure.” The phonetics are excellent and the semantics interestingly attractive. For Chantraine, the etymology is “unknown.” The Egyptian ˆqr has a wide range of meanings, all of them positive: “excellent, splendid, wealthy, superior, trustworthy.” The word provides a good etymology for ajglaov" (H) “brilliant, glorious.” Chantraine is uncertain but he suggests a connection with gelavw, normally “laugh” but he introduces a special sense of eclat (de rire) “burst (of laughter).” This is clearly inadequate. In addition, ˆqr supplies a good etymon for the prefix ajga- “great, glorious.” Chantraine is “uncertain” about its origin. Aga- is best known for its attachment to names, most famously to Agamevnwn. The origin of the second portion of the name and its Egyptian and Ethiopian connections are discussed in Volume 2.1 Also, ˆqr “excellent” provides an explanation for ajgaio", an epithet of a sacrificial lamb in the regulations of the Labyad phratry at Delphi. Chantraine writes of this “sense and etymology unknown.” Similarly, with the liquid /i/ retained there is Ai[glh (H) “radiance.” Chantraine has no etymology for this either. On its own, ˆtˆ is a term with a wide range of meanings: “to seize, take, carry off, plunder, surpass.” Derivatives include ˆtw or ˆtÅ “thief.” The Coptic form is o\d. Vycichl sees this as coming from an active participle *ia\tiy. In the Iliad there are two obscure hapakes: ai[hton and a[hton.2 Both contexts would fit the sense of “fierce” or “violent.” The Egyptian compound ˆt ˆn means “disorderly or erratic movement.” The verb ajavw (H) is “to bring harm to, wander erratically.” The erratic movement is attributed to the goddess {Ath, who was the personification of ajavth or a—[th “blind folly, violent recklessness.” Using an Aeolic form ajuvta as his base, Chantraine proposes an original digamma. This proposal somewhat weakens the phonetics of the parallels with the Egyptian terms. The French lexicographer, however, states that the etymology is unknown. Thus, given the excellent semantic fit between ate@ and ˆtˆ and ˆt ˆn and the reasonable phonetic fit there seems no reason to deny an Egyptian etymology. CeËrny reconstructed ŒÅbt “offering gift” as *ŒoÅbet.3 As an adjective ŒÅb meant “pleasing, pleasant” but also “selfish.” The Greek o[lbo" (H)



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 407
is “material happiness, blest, prosperous.” Chantraine describes this etymology as “obscure.” Klein associates the Hebrew Œåre\b “pleasant, sweet” with the biblical Aramaic Œårab “mixed, meddled.” It can more plausibly be seen as a loan from the Egyptian ŒÅb. Wr ˆb, literally “great heart,” meant “insolent, arrogant.” With the acceptable metathesis liquid from second to third position this word makes an excellent etymon for u{bri" (H) “insolent.” Szemerényi proposed a borrowing from the hypothetical Hittite form *hu(wa)ppar “outrage,” based on the verb huwap “maltreat.”4 Chantraine is not convinced, nor am I. WÅwÅ meant “to take counsel, consider, think about,” while oi[omai (H) was “to believe, consider.” The negative ajnwvisto" was “without consideration.” Chantraine believes that the sigma in such forms is primary at the beginning of a long chain of reconstruction: *oj ̧ivs-¥omai> *oj( ̧)ivo¥omai > *oj( ̧)-¥omai > oi[omai. Chantraine admits the etymology is unknown. Although the Egyptian etymology cannot explain the /s/ in some composite forms, it is otherwise strong in both phonetics and semantics. The earliest meaning of pravttw/pravssw is “to pass through” etc. This fits well with the Canaanite påras`“to break through, break/burst out of the womb.” A root pra- with a final velar is found in the perfect pevpraga, future pra\vxw with a further meaning of “accomplish, practice.” I believe that the phonetic complexity that baffles Chantraine and the other lexicographers should be seen together with semantic ambiguity and explained by the confusion of two distinct Afroasiatic verbs. The first of these is påras,`the second the Egyptian bÅk “to serve, work, carry out.” Pratto\ completes the Greek words of Afroasiatic origin for “to do, make.” Drao\and poieo\were introduced in Chapter 9.5 The third person in the Greek pronominal system is extremely irregular. In Chapter 6, I considered autos, substituting for the oblique cases.6 Then there is min Dorian nim, the accusative “him, her, it,” of all genders. Chantraine describes the etymology as “obscure.” The Egyptian mn Coptic man or nim meant “someone, a certain person or thing” and may derive from a Nostratic root *mEny found in the Indo-Eurepean *mann-s and the Proto-Afroasiatic *man, *mayan.7 Later in this chapter I shall argue that monos “alone, unique” comes from the same root.



408 BLACK ATHENA
In Chapter 8, I considered the correspondence of Egyptian /m/ to Greek /ph/. One example was mrw “weavers, serfs, lower classes” to the Greek fau'lo".8 Other loans were more straightforward. The collective mrt “weavers” has an exact correspondence with meritewo “weavers” in Linear B. Lexicographers have naturally subsumed nea\niva" (H) “young man, youth” under the oldest and most widespread Indo-European root *nu or *newa “new.” Chantraine devotes a long paragraph in an attempt to place neanias in this cluster but he comes up without a satisfactory explanation. It would seem simpler to accept that it does not fit the IndoEuropean root and to derive it from the Egyptian nh°n “young, youthful.” Although there is an exchange of the Egyptian medial -n- to Greek medial -m-, I have not found an accepted one of initial n->m-. Nevertheless, the semantic precision allowed Jernstedt to propose a loan from the Egyptian nkw, Coptic noeik (S) no\ik (B) “adulterer” to the Greek moicov" “adulterer.”9 Chantraine states that “everyone agrees that moicov" is nominal agent of ojmeivcw “piss.” He concedes a problem with the initial o- and is hesitant about the semantic correspondence. Both arguments have problems that could be reconciled by proposing confusion of two sources. Chantraine cannot find an Indo-European etymology for pevmpw (H) “to send, escort.” He, therefore, inclines to a “Pelasgic” or substrate source. There is, however, a possible Egyptian etymon in h°pp “to send off.” Attested examples of medial -h°-=-ø- exist but none of h°-=-ø-. In Chapter 10, I argued a parallel case that the young sun god H°prr became Apollo in Greece. Thus the derivation of pempo\from h°pp remains a strong possibility. The Egyptian qmÅ has a number of apparently disparate meanings: “to throw, create, produce, hammer out.” The common theme appears to be “craft.” Whether or not qmÅ “throw” is the potter throwing clay on the wheel, the association of pottery with creation can be seen in the cult of the ram god and potter of creation Khnum and the mythical birth of Hatshepsut as represented at Deir el Bahri. On the principle of exchange of liquids in the second and third positions, it would seem permissible to postulate an alternative form *qÅm. In the absence of an Indo-European competitor, this form provides a reasonable etymology kevramo" (H) “potting clay, tile, jar,” not necessarily of clay. In Volume 2, I discussed the links between the legendary ruler Danaos, the Danaans and the “Sea People” known to the Egyptians as TˆnÅw/



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 409
Tanaya or DÅˆn. Dene.10 Danaos’ legendary great age almost certainly came from the Egyptian tnˆ from an earlier tnˆ “old, decrepit, become feeble.” A proposal to derive the Greek root qn found in qnhvskw “die” and qavnato" (H) “death” would seem far-fetched, if it were not for the euphemisms surrounding “death” in many cultures. Indeed, Chantraine tentatively proposes one when he suggests cognicity with a Sanskrit cluster around dhva\n- ta “somber.” Both etymologies are possible but the Egyptian one is equally close in phonetics and closer in meaning. TÅm, Coptic je\me (S) ce\\me (B) is “to wrap enclose, cloak, veil.” The Greek qavlamo" (H) is discussed in the next chapter.11 In Chapter 5, I referred to the name Theseus as coming from the Egyptian tsw “commander.”12 This source word is derived from a root ts “tie together, marshal troops.” Tst are troops or a requisitioned gang of workmen. Qhv" (qhtov")(H) is a “slave, paid worker, laborer, lowest stratum of citizens.” In Greece today, qhteiva is “military service.” Neither Frisk nor Chantraine provides an etymology and the latter concludes “perhaps a loan.” DwÅ wr was the “deified royal beard.” In Greek daulov" (H) was “bushy bearded, associated with Zeus.” Chantraine is skeptical of previous proposed etymologies.
Semitic Vocabulary
In Chapter 8, I discussed the relationship between >aha=båh “love” Œågab “sensuous love,” and ajgapavw “love.”13 Båyay, bî are particles of entreaty in Arabic and Hebrew, used in formulae of address to superiors. baivo" (5) is “small, without importance, mean and humble.” It has no Indo-European etymology. The Greek bavrbaro" (H) is generally thought to be onomatopaeic, the result of stammering or the language of unintelligible foreigners. Chantraine cites the Sanskrit babara- “stammerer,” but he also mentions the Sumerian bar bar “stranger” and the Akkadian barbaru “wolf.” He denies both, however, seeing the form as perfectly Indo-European. He does not touch on the almost complete absence of /b/ in Greek words of Indo-European origin. There is, however another possible Semitic etymon in the root ÷gwr. Ge\r is a “sojourner, neighbor, newcomer, stranger.” The /w/ in the root makes it permissible to postulate an earlier form *gwer or *gwar. A connection with unintelligible speech is made in the Ethiopic gwargwar



410 BLACK ATHENA
“confused murmur.” Following the argument put forward in Chapter 5, gwargwar could have been introduced before the breakdown of labiovelars in Greek and have shifted regularly to barbaros.14 Gavrgara “chattering crowd” would have been introduced after the breakdown of labiovelars in both languages. Orel and Stolbova reconstruct an Afroasiatic root *bat-/bit “cut.”15 In Semitic a number of triliterals exist with the same general meaning. Thus, it is assumed that the root ÷btl is “to sever.” A widespread and uniform version is what appears to be a passive participle, the form batul “virgin” boy or girl. Referring to these young people as “cut” suggests male circumcision, which is known to have existed among Semitic speakers, and female genital mutilation, which may have also. Mivtulo" (3) and muvtilo" are two obscure, but related, Greek terms. In one sense they refer to a ram without horns and in another to the youngest child. The Latin mutilus borrowed from mytilos means “dehorned.” Thus in Greek and Latin, as in Semitic, one finds the double meaning of youth and cutting. This semantic correspondence, more than makes up for the alternation, initial m- for initial b- for which there are other examples.
Hbr. The basic meaning of the Semitic root ÷h°br is “to join, associate” but with frequent associations of magic, idols and badness. It is found in the Ugaritic h≥br and the Phoenician h≥br and the Hebrew håbe\r “companion.” The Greek aJbrov" (H) means “gracious, delicate, pretty.” It and the feminine a{bra became associated with effeminacy and “oriental” luxury. Scholars have long seen connections between the Aramaic håbe\r and the Greek word.16 E. Masson, however, denied claims on the following grounds: that the Semitic terms do not refer to a servant but to a companion of equal rank, that the Aramaic feminine was habertta and that an Aramaic loan would be difficult to explain during the epoch of Menander, fourth to third centuries BCE. The last reason is strange because (1) The loan did not have to be from Aramaic rather than from Canaanite; h≥br existed in both Phoenician and Hebrew. (2) Plenty of Aramaic was spoken during the lifetime of Menander. (3) The word is attested in a fragment from Hesiod, centuries before Menander.17 It is sad to see Chantraine following such niggling pedantry. Another word aJpalov" (H) “tender, delicate” has a similar sense and, with slight alteration, fits the phonetics relatively well. Chantraine writes “no etymology.” The Semitic root ÷wqh found in the Arabic waqita “to



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 411
be obedient” and the Sabaean wqh “hear [favorably]” appears in Akkadian as âqû “obedient.” Presumably, the Canaanite would have been *yåqah. The attested noun yiqhåh is “obedience.” Ajkouvw (7) is “to hear, understand.” Chantraine’s preferred etymology is from a root found in the Gothic hausjan “hear.” He has difficulty with the prothetic a-, but he relates akouo\to koevw kowo? “to perceive, understand, hear.” This he sees as cognate to the Old Saxon skawo\n “to observe” and the Sanskrit kavi “wise.” While the connection between akouo\and koeo\ is plausible. The rest of the scheme seems very flimsy. An etymology for akouo\ from *yåqah is much less unlikely. The use of “boy” for servant is a widespread phenomenon across languages: garçon in French, tóng in Chinese, for example. The Arabic yatim, Hebrew yåtom and Aramaic yatmåh all mean “orphan, helpless child.” A form resembling the Aramaic probably gave us ajtmhvn (3) “servant, slave.” Chantraine describes this as “obscure” and says it “risks being a loan.” He favors seeing it as coming from Asia Minor. For the etymology of the stem yeu'd- “false” from the Semitic ÷zwd “to lie, exaggerate,” see Chapter 14.18 A sinister standard image of Phoenician art is of a woman looking through a lattice window, symbolizing enclosure. In Hebrew the plural form for “lattices” is ha`=raki$m. In Aramaic one finds ha`=rakå “window.” In Greek, e{rko" (H) was “enclosure around house, by barrier or wall, net for hunting” and oJrkavnh (6) was a “prison.” Chantraine associates the form with the Latin sarcio “to resew, repair.” He sees the general sense as “weaving.” Although the Hebrew and Aramaic words do not appear to have deep roots in Semitic, they do provide a more plausible source for the Greek word than the one Chantraine offers. The etymology of EJtoi§mo" “ready, sure,” which Chantraine describes as “obscure,” was discussed in Chapter 14.19 The Central Chadic language of Musgum has a root *kas “fall” which, with a prefixed n-, is found in the Semitic, Jibbali and Arabic. Another plausible extension with a final -l is the Hebrew kås=al “to stumble, stagger, totter,” which in the hiphil-derived conjugation is “to cause to stumble, bring injury or ruin.” Greek has kasavlbion “brothel” and kasalbavzw “to live as a prostitute.” The final syllables remain unexplained but the basic kasal fits well. Chantraine subsumes these words under kasa`" (3) “coarse coverlet.” He accepts E. Masson’s view that this has a Semitic
origin found in the Akkadian kasu\and the Hebrew kEsut\ “covering.”20 s



412 BLACK ATHENA
The derivation of the Greek laov", “people” from the West Semitic
÷l>m was discussed in Chapter 13.21 The origin of levgw and lovgo" with their multiple meanings from the West Semitic ÷lqh∫ with its multiple meanings was considered in Chapter 14.22 As an addendum to this discussion, the Arabic laqah≥a is “to take” a woman “impregnate.” This provides an origin for the obscure Greek verbs lhkavw (4) and laikavzw (4) “to fornicate, make love.” The possibly Semitic and ultimately Egyptian origin of levsch was discussed in Chapter 7.23 Mavkellon (1) was “grill, cloister” later, probably from Latin, “market or butcher’s stall.” Not surprisingly, the lexicographers are open to the idea that it could have a Semitic etymology, and Chantraine mentions two possibilities. He is doubtful of Lewy’s proposal that it derives from miklåh “enclosure” but notes a suggestion that it comes from the widespread Semitic root ÷mkr “to sell, merchant” found in Ugaritic, Phoenician, and Hebrew.24 He makes no comment about Mayer’s derivation of makellon from the Semitic root ÷mkr.25 The root found in the Akkadian manû, the Arabic manay “to assign, apportion” and the Hebrew månåh “to count, assign,” provides a plausible etymology for mhnuvw (H) “to inform, indicate, denounce.” Chantraine writes “no etymology.” The root ÷ms∫∫∫> is widespread in Semitic. The Akkadian mas∫eû and the Ugaritic and Ge’ez ms∫> all mean “to arrive, attain.” The Hebrew and the Aramaic forms mås∫≥å> have the additional senses of “to seek, find.” A number of Greek terms beginning mas- or mat- have similar meanings. The lexicographers agree that maivomai (6) “to search, pursue, reach” rests on a form mas-yo-mai. Chantraine gives as his first sense of matevw (6) “to search, pursue.” The verb mw'mai (6) is “to desire, aim for.” Its third-person singular is mw'tai and the imperative is mw'so. Chantraine senses a relationship with maivomai. He points out, however, that the latter too lacks a clear etymology. Mw'mai appears to be a borrowing after the Canaanite shift a\>o\. The Akkadian nakâlu is “to be crafty, cunning”; the Hebrew nåkal is “to be crafty, deceitful.” A punning attestation in the Piel conjugation goes: “niklêhem as=er niklû låkem “their wiles with which they deceived you.”26 Given the worldwide reputation of slaves for craftiness, this definition fits reasonably well with the Greek nikuvrta" (6) “born slave” Chantraine states merely that it may be an Asiatic borrowing.27



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 413
The etymology of a number of Greek words associated with mourning from the Semitic root ÷spd was set out in Chapter 13.28 I discussed the derivation of ajgapavw “love” from ÷>gb “sensuous love” in Chapter 8.29 The possible derivation of xevno" “stranger, guest” from Semitic ÷svn> “enemy” was discussed in Chapter 13.30 The origin of scolhvin the sense of “rest and leisure” comes from the Semitic root found in the Ugaritic sl=w Hebrew s=ålu or s=Elî “rest, ease”31 The Phoenician s=mr, Hebrew s=åmar is “to keep watch, guard, protect.” This provides a plausible etymon for the first part of the Greek sabarivci" or samarivch “women’s sex.” The second half is less easy to explain; Chantraine has no etymology for the word.
Conclusion
The etymologies proposed in this book vary greatly both in their importance and in their quality. On both scores the range is probably at its greatest in this section. The origins of the centrally important terms laos “people” from Semitic and hybris “fatal pride” from Egyptian contrasts with those of daulos “bushy beard” and baios, an obscure form of humble address. On the aspect of quality they vary from the possible h≠pp>pempo@
to the extremely plausible derivation of olbos “pleasing and prosperous” from the Egyptian ŒÅb with the same meaning. Taken together, however, they show the centrally important role of Afroasiatic languages in the formation of Greek social terms and hence the great influence of Egyptian and West Semitic speakers on early Greek society itself.
POLITICS
Egyptian vocabulary
As a former professor of “government,” I know how difficult it is to make useful distinctions between society and politics. I have tried to draw the line between those organizations and processes that affect the running of the polity, city or state and those that do not. The key word in the image of Greece is Ejleuvqero" “liberty.” A tentative etymology from ˆr(t) ∆Åwt “celebrate a festival” will be set out in the next chapter.32



414 BLACK ATHENA
In Egypt, iÅwt was a “herd of cattle or humans,” ˆrw/y was a “levy for the cattle tax. “ This gives a reasonable etymology for a\jlhv"/a\Jlhv" (5) “assembly.” (As Chantraine points out there are readings for this and the associated words both with or without rough breathing.) The vowel or diphthong was varied: ajollhv" and ajevvllh". Moreover there are, as Chantraine indicates, other terms that are clearly related: a{li" (H) “in mass” and ei[lw (H). The last has a number of meanings: “shut in [usually of people], press [olives and grapes], wind, turn.” The editors of the Liddell, Scott, Jones Lexicon (LSJ) specifically deny that these meanings have a general sense of “squeeze.” “Wind” is clearly anomalous and can be explained as “contamination” from the verb eijluvw “roll, twist,” which like the Latin volvo, comes from an Indo-European root for “turn.” The other meanings, however, can be subsumed under the sense of “squeeze” and fit well with an Egyptian origin in cattle counting. The confusion of terms suggests a borrowing. It is interesting to note that the Athenian counterpart to the Ionian and Dorian al\e\s was ajqrovo" “crowd, squeezed together” derived from the Egyptian ˆdrˆ “herd” raised in Chapter 15. ˆrr “evildoer,” ˆrrt “work” provide a reasonable etymology for the Homeric hapax ei[reron “slavery.” Chantraine denies any link with the Latin servus and is skeptical of all other proposals. The derivation of ai\sa “share, destiny” a[xio" “equivalent, counterbalance” and i[so" and the prefix ijso- “balance, level, equal” from ˆsw Coptic asou “reward, compensation,” was discussed in Chapter 12.33 The proposal to derive i[dio" “simple, inexperienced common citizen” from the Egyptian ˆd “child” was made in Chapter 9.34 The derivation of o[clo" “the mob, the masses, “from Œs=Å “many numerous, troublesome” was given in Chapter 8.35 The origin of basileuv" “high official” later “king” from the Egyptian pÅ sr or pasiyara is discussed at length in Chapter 9.36 R∆ is “to know” and as a noun “wisdom” and rht° is “knowledge and number.” In Late Egyptian rh°is also attested with the meanings “take note,” and “list.” The Demotic rh°and the Coptic ro|s+(S) and ras+(B) in
cluded the meanings “measure” and “affirm.” Lagcavnw the stem lacis “draw by lot,” frequently used in Greek politics. At a theological level lovgch, lavco" and Lavcesi" all meant “fate.”
The lexicographers see kh'rux, karuke in Linear B, as coming from an Indo-European root found in the Sanskrit ka\rú “poet, singer.” Apart from the semantic looseness, the lack of a final k is a problem. The same is



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 415
true of a derivation from the Semitic root ÷qrŒ “call.” A much more probable origin is from the frequently attested Egyptian qÅ hr°w “loud of voice.” It is interesting to note that one of the two first heralds mentioned in the Iliad was Eujrubavth" who was described as “round-shouldered, dark of skin, and curly haired.”37 The tradition or stereotype that Africans have loud and melodious voices can be seen again in Mohammed’s choice of the Black Bilal\ to chant the first muezzin or call to prayer. The origin of e[qno" from tnw “number, numbering” and tnwt “census of cattle, prisoners etc.” was given in Chapter 8.38 In Chapter 12 I discuss of dmˆ “town, village” and dmˆw “townsmen” as the origin of dhvmo" damo in Linear B.
Semitic vocabulary
In the last chapter I discussed the Semitic root ÷>r∆ and one of its reflexes in Greek, ajrc- which became the root of many important political terms: ajrcov" “chief,” ajrchv “political power,” a[rcwn “magistrate.”39 The derivation of the Greek koinov" (H) “common, public, impartial” from the Canaanite ÷kwn “establish, correct” was covered in Chapter 5.40 In biblical Hebrew one finds the verb pålal “arbitrate, judge.” In Late Hebrew there is the noun pilpel\ “one skilled in debating.” The Odyssey refers to the Foivnike" polupaivpaloi “wily Phoenicians.”41 The modifier -paipaloi makes an excellent fit with pilpel\. Since pevrpero" (2) “boaster, trying to be smart” is only attested late, Chantraine suggests that it may be a loan from the Latin perperam “oblique, contrary, bad.” Although the phonetics of the Latin etymology are marginally better the semantics favor the Semitic one. For my proposal to derive bouvlh “assembly, council” from the Canaanite qåhål “assembly,” see Chapter 14.42 The common Semitic root ÷ r>s “head, leader” was almost certainly originally vocalized ra>s as it still is in Arabic. In Ugaritic it was re/i>s. In Hebrew it is ro\>s=. The meaning of Rjhsov" (5) is doubtful but it is assumed to be “leader.” In this case the etymology would almost certainly be from an early borrowing from ra>s going through the shift a\>e\, just as the Canaanite went from a\>o\.



416 BLACK ATHENA
Conclusion
This section reveals two very interesting political and historical features. First Egyptian terms for bureaucratic counting or censuses of cattle and prisoners—ˆrw/y “cattle count” ˆdrˆ “herd”—become in Greek, (h)al\e\s and athroos, words for popular assemblies. Only ethnos from tnwt “counting of cattle or prisoners” retained something of its original official origin. This underlines the difference between centralized bureaucratic Egypt and the scattered Greek poleis. The terms were very probably introduced into the bureaucratic palatial society of Mycenaean Greece and only later developed their popular meanings. Elsewhere I have argued, and this is the second interesting feature, that many if not most economic, social and political aspects of the polis were based on Phoenician models.43 This makes the number of Egyptian, as opposed to Semitic, terms in this section particularly striking. While some of the building blocks of “political” terminology of the Archaic and Classical periods arkh- and koin- come from Semitic, many others—including de\mos, okhlos, iso-, and idios—have plausible Egyptian etymologies and entered Greek well before the sixth-century tide of Egyptian influence on Greece. The one significant political term with a plausible Semitic etymology boule\ must have entered Greek before the breakdown of labiovelars. By the First Millennium they must have been accepted as native. The best explanation is that rather than accepting new Semitic names for the institutions copied from the Levant, Greeks often preferred to use and develop existing ones. Sometimes the words were native Indo-European but more often they were Egyptian and were borrowed in the Late Bronze Age or earlier. A specific example of these stages can be seen in Martin West’s detailed demonstration of parallels between Greek and southwest Asian types of oaths, but he is unable to explain horkos the word for “oath” itself, which has a good Egyptian etymology.44 In the next chapter, we shall see a similar pattern of Egyptian divine names being set in a predominantly southwest Asian theogony.
LAW AND ORDER
Introduction
This section overlaps both of the two previous ones because law is at the intersection of polity and society. I believe that the higher proportion of Egyptian over Semitic terms I have found in this semantic region can be



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 417
explained for the same reasons given in the conclusion to the previous section.
Egyptian vocabulary
Ajluvta" (5) is “police officer at Elis, probably a supervisor of the Olympic games.” Chantraine accepts the theory that it is linked to the Gothic walus “baton,” reconstructing a * ̧alu-ta`" “man of the baton.” There are two, not necessarily exclusive, Egyptian etymologies: first, iÅt “office, function” and iÅtyw “office holders” and, second, iÅÅyt “rod.” Clearly, ˆpwty>wpwty “messenger, agent,” is related to the verb wpˆ in the sense of “judge contestants at law.” This double connotation provides a good explanation for the Greek hjpuvta (H) “sonorous voice of a herald” and hjpu±v≠w (H) “call in a loud voice to convoke before a tribunal.” Chantraine describes their etymology as “obscure.” Chantraine sharply distinguishes between what he sees as two independent meanings of the word ejfevtai. The first, a hapax in Aiskhylos, means merely “chiefs.” The second, found on inscriptions, is the institutional name of a college of judges at Athens; this college specialized in trials of mitigated murder or manslaughter. The lexicographers derive this from the suffix -ta" on a form of the verb ejfivemi “sent out, delegated.” This is plausible but some of the confusion could well have been caused by “contamination” from ˆpwty. In another legal area, ˆdryt “punishment,” appears to be a nominal form of the verbs dÅˆ and dÅr “to subdue, suppress, rob someone of their goods.” Much vagueness and some disagreement exists about the word aji\vdhlo". All one can say is that when used as an epithet of Athena and Ares it is “destructive.”45 When the word is used as an epithet of “fire” or of Penelope’s suitors, “consuming” corresponds well with the
last sense given to dÅr.46 The commonly held view that ai\dvel\os comes from a privative a-ideîn “make disappear” is extremely implausible. In a discussion of the origin of ajnavgkh “necessity” in Chapter 10, I discussed the Egyptian Œnh°in the sense of “bound, constrain,” Coptic anas=(SB) anah°(A) “oath, something you are bound to.”47 Vycichl argued for a correspondence between Œnh°and Œrq “oath.” I find the correspondence h°=q somewhat difficult but Orel and Stolbova see it as a standard alternation within Afroasiatic.48 In any event, at least one plausible example can be found in the attractive parallel between Homer’s Acaivoi Achaeans and the “People of the Sea” called ˆqws= by Egyptians.49



418 BLACK ATHENA
Be that as it may, like Œnh,° Œrq too has a plausible reflex in Greek. In 1763, L’ Abbé Jean Jacques Barthelemy proposed deriving the Greek o{rko" (H) “to bind, swear, oath” from the Coptic o@Rk.50 O—Rk was the descendent of Œrq. Chantraine provided no etymology but Szemerényi tried to derive it from a Indo-European root *sworkos. There is a Germanic root *swer as in “to swear, answer.” I can find no justification for the final -k. PÅwt meant “primeval time.” PÅwty was a “primeval god” or a “man of ancient family.” In many cities pruvtani" (H) was the title of senior magistrates and an epithet used for important gods. Chantraine notes the Etruscan purth, purthne “magistrate” and, therefore, sees the Greek title as borrowed from Anatolian. He points out that the variety of forms indicates a loan. Etruscan is the only Anatolian language in which the word is attested. Nevertheless, as the Egyptian word lacks the /n/ it is more likely that the word comes from Anatolia. Ultimately, however, the Anatolian term would seem to come from pÅwty. The Egyptian etymology of mav “truly!” used in oaths is discussed in Chapter 10.51 The Egyptian mtr Coptic mntre (S) methre (B) “witness” provides an excellent source for the Greek mavrtu", marturo" (4). Chantraine is skeptical of Frisk’s *mar-tu “testimony” but suggests that the word could be cognate to the Sanskrit smárati. The Egyptian etymology of novmo" “custom, law” was set out in Chapter 12.52 Hp, hpw Coptic hap “laws, rights, justice” h[pio" (H) “sweet benevolent as a father, reasonable.” Chantraine describes the Greek word as “obscure.” He is not impressed by attempts to associate it with the Sanskrit a\pi “friend.” The etymologies of calepov"- “painful, cruel” kovlafo" “punch, beating” and kovptw “punch, strike” from hr°p “baton of office, govern, control” were proposed in Chapter 8.53 The verb snh(y) was “to register, record, muster.” Snh was a “registry.” Also, saniv" (H) was a “plank, writing tablet,” notably to inscribe official texts. Chantraine offers no etymology. The qÅ in qÅ ∆rw/kh'rux discussed above is “high.”54 Redoubled qÅÅ
is “high ground,” written with I (O40) or O (O41) indicating terraces. The kavllion (4) was the precinct where an Athenian tribunal sat.” Chantraine has no etymology. Qnb was “to bend subjugate, fetter, bow low.” The Greek gnavptw



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 419
(H) is “bend a limb, a person, a person’s will, subjugate.” Chantraine has no etymology. Qnbt was a “court of magistrates, tribunal, judicial council etc.” With the definite article *PÅ qnbt could well be the etymon of Pnuvx, Puknov" (5), the meeting place for the citizen juries of Athens.55 The semantic fit is excellent and may be reinforced by the use of the u (O38) “corner” as the determinative of qnbt. Gardiner suggested that it may be that the magistrates sat at a corner.56 The Pnyx had an amphitheatral shape and was against a high cliff. On the other hand, the word could also have some connotations from qnb “subjugate.” Tn, later tn, was a postposed feminine deictic. It provides a reasonable etymology for qhn (H) an emphatic enclitic “really, truly.”57 It may also be the source of dei'na (5) “such and such, often indicating hesitation.” Chantraine has no explanation for either. The etymology of tivnw “pay debt or fine” from dit inw “cause to bring [ˆnw /tribute]” was set out in Chapter 9. So, too, are the legal senses of dˆt mÅœ /timhv.58 In Chapter 15 I discussed dnˆ as a dam or water channel and further meanings of “to allot, distribute” and dnyt a “land register.” These provide a reasonable etymology for dhvnea (H) “plans good or bad.”59
Semitic vocabulary
No one has ever doubted that the Greek letter lavmda (4) derives from an earlier Semitic form of that found in the Hebrew letter name låmed. The shape L or L comes from an ox goad. This root is present with the nominal prefix m- in the Hebrew malEmåd, with that meaning. Chantraine believes that the earliest Greek form is not lavmda but lavbda. He does not state it but the reason for the development of the later lamda can only have been as hypercorrection to return to the original Semitic form. Labda makes an excellent parallel to rJavbdo" (5) “stick, wand, sign of authority.” Chantraine prefers to relate it to a Balto-Slav root *÷wrb` “branch, reed.” Then there is a[bdh" (6CE) “whip.” Chantraine dismisses the claim “made without evidence” that it is a loan from Asianic.
Conclusion
The disproportion of words with etymologies from Egyptian, as opposed to Semitic, origins in this semantic area is even more extreme than the



420 BLACK ATHENA
pattern seen in the section on politics above. Once more, the pattern suggests that Greeks had a legal vocabulary from the Bronze Age available to be used in the new age of the polis. It is striking that almost all basic legal terms in English have French or Latin etymologies: bar, counsel, court, judge, jury, testimony etc. These reflect both the Norman Conquest and the high status of French in England during the Middle Ages. If, as seems probable, the Hyksos were predominantly Semitic speaking, it would seem that the presence of so many words of Egyptian origin in this sphere of the Greek vocabulary indicates not conquest but the high status of Egyptian during the New Kingdom in the second half of the Second Millennium and again in the late seventh and sixth centuries BCE.
ABSTRACTION
Abstraction is the inner sanctum of the Greek vocabulary. The continued use of these terms in “western” philosophy have given these words, and ancient Greek culture as whole, an important impetus to elevation to the superhuman, universal and eternal.
Egyptian vocabulary
The verb ˆˆ is “to come, occur.” It is found in the idioms ˆw spf “him in whom fault had occurred” and m ˆˆ n “outcome, as a consequence of.” In addition, ˆyt is “mishap” but also what “is to come.” The Greek ai[tio" (H) “responsible, who is the cause of, accuse, illness,” finally the philosophical sense “cause.” Chantraine considers the possibility of a cognate in the Avestan aet\a “fault, punishment.” With its semantic grounds the Egyptian etymology appears marginally better. One of the many meanings of the verb ˆrˆ “to make, construct” is “to work out mathematically.” Chantraine breaks up ajriqmov" (H) “count, number, sometimes arithmetic” into a stem ajri- and a suffix -qmov". He proposes cognicity with the Old High German and Irish ri\m “number” and with an Indo-European theme *ri. He cannot explain the initial a-. The Egyptian etymology solves this problem, although the semantics are merely passable. Next, ˆkm is a form of km “complete, completion, conclusion,” attested with a prothetic ˆ- in Late Egyptian, and ajkmhv (H) is “culminating point, opportune moment.” Chantraine subsumes this form as an expansion of the Indo-European *ak “sharp,” although he admits that no



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 421
parallel for akme\exists. The Egyptian etymology is discussed in Chapter 5.60 The derivation of ajnavgkh “constraint, necessity” from Œnh°was given above and in Chapter 10.61 A reasonable etymology for a ojrqov" (H) “erect, perpendicular, straight line” can be found in wÅt “cord,” and wÅwÅt “plumbline.” The Sanskrit u\rdhvá “erect, high” offers serious competition. Chantraine postulates an original * ̧orq ̧ov", although only  ̧orqov" is attested. The double digammas would correspond with either the Egyptian or the Sanskrit etymologies. Numbers are inherently abstractions and most of those in Greek are firmly Indo-European. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions and, interestingly, in Greek one of them is “one.” In Chapter 3, I mentioned
that the Egyptian word for “one” written with a uniserial harpoon A
(T21) was wŒ and that wŒˆ is to be “alone.”62 In Greek oi\o" is “one, alone.” Chantraine reconstructs a suffix - ̧o" “indicating a spatial relationship.” He then relates the stem to the Avestan ae\va and Sanskrit eka “one.” The Egyptian etymology is more direct. Earlier in this chapter, I pointed out that the Egyptian mn Coptic man or nim meant “someone, a certain person, or thing.” Despite difficulties with vocalization, this source is plausible for movno" (H) “alone, unique.” Apart from speculating that in this case too there was the suffix -Ïo" Chantraine dismisses previous suggestions. In Volume 2 and elsewhere, I have argued for Egyptian origins of eJkatovn (H) “hundred” from h≥qÅt “hundred measure” and cil- “thousand” from hÅ° “thousand.”63 The Egyptian word for “ten thousand” h≥fn provides an etymology for the Greek a[feno~ “riches, opulence, abundance,” which Frisk describes as “unexplained.” MÅÅ is “to see, look.” In the latter sense it may well be the indirect origin of the Old Latin root *mir to “look.” MÅÅ is also used in the personal sense of a “seer.” With the preposition /r/ added, mÅÅ-r is “to look to, take care of, toward, take care of.” The Greek mevllw (H) is “destined, about to, take heed of.” All are concerned with the future. There may also be influence from the Egyptian mÅ “new, renew.” Chantraine cannot explain the geminated /l/ and dismisses both attempts to link it to Celtic mall “slow, soft” and Pokorny’s attempt to associate it with mevlw “concern, care.” I believe Pokorny may be right and melo\too may come from mÅÅ.64 Chantraine describes its etymology as “unknown.”



422 BLACK ATHENA
In the section on law I stated the argument that the Greek mavrtu", marturo" “witness” derived from the Egyptian mtr “testify, witness.”65 However, the Egyptian word also had the extended meanings “to demonstrate, instruct, recognize.” Confusion between teaching and learning is a common feature in many languages, as in “I’ll learn you!” Thus it is permissible to propose that the Greek manqavnw (H) root maq- “to learn, study, understand” derives from mtr, possibly confused with mty “straightforward, precise.” Chantraine dismisses suggested Indo-European etyma as “far from the sense”; most in fact contain /n/, which is merely an infix marking the present in manthano\. He even rejects possible cognicity with the Sanskrit medha\“wisdom,” which seems to me more plausible, though not as good as that from mtr. The African origin of the Greek novo" “intelligence, perception,” was discussed in Chapter 12.66 In Chapter 10, I considered the etymology of many of the words with the stems tevl-, tevlo" “to the limit, complete, fulfilled perfect” and th'le “far, distant” from the Egyptian (r)-dr.67 The overall meaning of hÅw, he\or he in Coptic was “enclosing boundary.” It applied to kin; space, including vicinity and neighborhood; and time, including lifetime.68 The Greek o{ro" (H) (ou\ro") was “boundary, limit in space and time; intervals in music and numbers; definition in logic.” Chantraine emphasizes forms, largely inscriptional without aspiration and argues that even the Attic aspiration may come from the loss of an original /w/. He is interested in the idea of a link with the Oscan uruvù “furrow, boundary.” Nevertheless, his general attitude towards the etymology is “little certain.” The derivation of Sofiva, “wisdom” from sbÅ “learning” was discussed at length in Chapter 10.69 Sh°t, Coptic so\s=e “marsh, meadow, field, country as opposed to town” is written with the determinative t (M20) “reeds growing side by side.”70 It provides a good basis for e[scato" (H) “edge, end, extreme” initially in space, later applied to time and morality. Chantraine sees it as certainly derived from ejx “out” but beyond that he is unsure. This derivation could explain the prothetic e-, which could equally, or better, be derived from the coming together of the /s/ and the /h°/. Thus, the Egyptian etymology explains more. In an earlier chapter, I argued that the Egyptian paradise the “field of rushes”—Sh°t ˆÅrw—could, with the disappearance of the feminine /t/—as in so\s=e—Sh°ˆÅrw, provide a plausible etymology for Scerivh, the dreamlike island in the Odyssey.71



[CH. 17] POLITICS, LAW, AND ABSTRACTION 423
A connection between tavssw root tac- “to place, set in order, assign, prescribe” and the Egyptian t(Å)s= “to limit, fix, assign, decide” was proposed in Chapter 8.72 In Chapter 12, I argued that a Nostratic emphatic */t’/ could become either /t/ or /d/ in Egyptian, and in Chapter 15, I cited Takács who provides examples of Proto-Afroasiatic /t’/ resulting in /t/ in Egyptian.73 In Indo-European /t’/ became /t/ in Germanic and Armenian and /d/ in other branches. Therefore, the striking coincidence of the Egyptian tp “head,” but also “tip” and “on,” with the English “top” and “tip” may not be random but a common preservation of a Nostratic *t’p. In any event, a similar descendent in Greek would have been *dVp. Thus, the Greek tovpo" (5) cannot be derived from such a root or any other. The basic sense of topos is “place, point,” but it has many other meanings. It appears to have a close association with Egypt and is used for districts there. This could come from either tp as “chief ” or the compound tp-rd “plan, rule.” The sense of topos as “the theme of a discourse” resembles tpw-r “utterance, speech, expression.” The mathematical aspect of topos has a precedent in tp- “base of a triangle.” The apparently anomalous form topei`on (3) “cordage” comes from tpt “cord, thread.” The strangely parallel semantic clusters found between tp and topos are too striking to ignore, especially when Chantraine baldly describes the etymology as “unknown.” A calque confirms that some Greeks were aware that tp meant “head” when the Egyptian term for migraine gs-tp “half head” was copied into Greek as hjmikravnia “half head.”
Semitic vocabulary
E. Masson and Chantraine do not doubt that the Greek kavnna, Mycenaean kaneja “reed” derives from the common Semitic root found in the Akkadian qanu, Ugaritic qn, Phoenician qn> and Hebrew qåneh “reed.”74 Chantraine goes on to derive from this kavnwn (H) “straight stick, rule” and “grammatical, artistic, musical and mathematical canon.” The Semitic etymology of kovsmo" “to arrange, set in good order, universe” from the Semitic root ÷qsm was put forward in Chapter 14.75 In 1981, Oswald Szemerényi proposed that rJovmbo" “rhombus,” derived from the Semitic ÷rbŒ “four” found in the Hebrew råbuŒa.76 He specifically denies the conventional linkage made by Chantraine to rJevmbomai (4) “to wander, turn like a top.”

Conclusion
It often suits thinkers to possess a foreign vocabulary for use in abstract thinking. Intellectually, foreign words lessen distraction from concrete images associated with native words and, socially, they help mystify and confuse those outside the rarified circles of the privileged with knowledge of other languages. Sometimes an arcane ancient language is sufficient for these purposes: Demotic- and Coptic-speaking Egyptians liked to write in Middle Egyptian just as Chinese literati used classical Chinese up to the early twentieth century. After that, the Chinese Nationalist elite used English to serve the same functions. In Europe, Latin and Greek played these roles; first elites wrote in Latin and, later, they larded their vernacular works with classical tags and words. The situation in Ancient Greece seems to have been of this type. From the examples given above, we can see that much of Greek academic or theoretical writing used, if it did not depend on, words of Egyptian and Semitic origin.



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 425
CHAPTER 18
RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY
S
ubsequent chapters deal with specific aspects of religion. Chapter 19 is concerned with proper nouns, the names of gods and other mythological figures. Chapter 20 focuses on geographical features. Chapter 21 concentrates on the gods and cults of Sparta and Chapter 22 does the same for Athens. This chapter is restricted to religious terminology under the following headings: sacred structures, personnel, rituals, mourning, paraphernalia, sacrifice, incense, flowers, aura and mysteries. As the Semitic and Egyptian components in this semantic region are approximately equal, they will be treated together, thematically rather than alphabetically.
STRUCTURES
Before considering the structures, we need to consider the surroundings of the sacred place. The Greek shkov" (H) is an enclosure in general but also a sacred enclosure around a sanctuary, tomb of a hero or olive grove. Chantraine describes the conventional etymology from a hypothetical Indo-European root *twak as “simply an hypothesis.” The Hebrew Sûk or Sôkå means “thorn hedge and the area it encloses.” There are placenames Sôkô and Sôkoh. The difference between the Hebrew /ô/ and
the Greek /e\/ can be seen in the treatment of so\mva and se\mva; see Chapter 5.1 Ajulhv (H) means “surroundings, courtyard.” Chantraine finds



426 BLACK ATHENA
the Armenian aw-t’ “resting place” and ag-anim “to spend the night.” He is unable to find any remotely comparable word with an /l/ in IndoEuropean. The Canaanite >ûlåm comes from a Semitic root found in the Akkadian ellamu “in front of.” It means “porch” or “altar in front of temple.” The absence of the final -m in aule\can be explained by adaptation through the accusative aule\n. Indo-Europeanists derive bwmov" (H) “platform or altar” from baíno\ “to walk, go.” They relate it to bh'ma “tribune,” which they claim derives from baino\.2 Semitists, however, have long noticed a striking similarity between bo\mos and the Hebrew båmåh “shrine, high place.”3 They refer to the Ugaritic word bmt that appears to mean “back” and the Akkadian bamatu, which may signify “mountain ridges.”4 John Pairman Brown is skeptical about these supposed cognates and argues that bmt is uncertain and bamatu does not mean “mountain ridges” but “open plains.”5 He, therefore, accepts the Indo-European etymology for bomos and derives båmåh from it. He sees it as having been introduced by the biblical Hivites whose name he identifies with Akhai(w)oi Akhaeans.6 By contrast, his close friend Saul Levin tentatively derives båmåh and, hence, bo\mos from a Semitic root ÷bnh/y “to build” and attacks the IndoEuropeanist view that it is related to be\ma “platform” and derives from baíno\ “to come, go.” He argues that an altar is precisely what one does not step on.7 All in all, it is clear that the two words share a relationship and the likelihood is that it came from the Levant to Greece. The reverse could be true, however, or both could derive from a third language. In such a case, the most likely candidate is Egyptian, in the same way that it provides an origin for the parallel Hebrew and Greek terms lis=kåh and levsch, which among other things meant “place of rest, tomb.”8 The alternation e\/o\in be\ma and bo\mos also suggests a borrowing from Semitic or Egyptian before and after the Canaanite shift. The only remote possibility of an Egyptian etymology is from bnbn, the stone sacred to the sun and associated with the sacred hill of Atum at the creation of the world.9 However, I have been unable to find any possible etymon for be\ma and bo\mos.
The Semitic origin of na\os “temple,” and the Egyptian of the\sauros “sanctum, treasury” have been given above.10 The Afroasiatic root *dud “pot, cauldron” had a Hebrew form dûd and an Aramaic one dûda.11 The meaning of duta– (4) is uncertain. Liddell and Scott write “shrine”; Chantraine says “chapel?” or “well.” The likelihood of the last meaning and a derivation from Semitic is that one of the two places where it is



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 427
attested is at the Kabeirion at Thebes, with its doubly strong association with Semitic culture.12 In the seventeenth century, Samuel Bochart noted the striking parallel between the Hebrew mEœårå “cave” and the Greek mevgara “sacred pit.” Knowing Arabic he appears to have assumed that the Hebrew >ayin derived from an earlier g!ayin.13 His inference was confirmed in the twentieth century by the discovery of an Ugaritic form mg!rt. Even E. Masson and Chantraine admit that this Semitic etymology is possible.14 Megas “great” has a clear Indo-European etymology. Is this the origis∫n of mevgaron (H) “great hall”? Chantraine resists temptations to associate it with megas and grants that it “could be borrowed.” He further does not reject the idea that megara and megaron could be related and borrowed from Semitic. The opposite of the megaron was the qavlamo" (H), Linear B taramata? Chantraine defines it as “a room in the interior of the house, room of the mistress of the house, and one where provisions or precious objects are enclosed.” It was also used for an interior chapel or sanctuary. Both Frisk and Chantraine see possible similarities with thólos, a conical tomb or other structure, which itself has no Indo-European etymology. They admit, however, that thálamos is equally without one.15 The Egyptian tÅm means “cover, cloak, veil.” The consonantal structures of tÅm and thálamos fit and the semantic parallels are strengthened by the associations of the Greek term with enclosed women’s quarters and marriage and bridal chambers. Aphrodite who had the epiklesis thalamon–was sometimes portrayed as wearing a veil.16 An equally clear Semitic etymology is that of baivtulo" (1CE) “sacred stone dropped from the sky” from the Hebrew Bêt>e–l, Bethel “house of God.” Chantraine argues that the etymology is “unknown.” He sees it as a “Mediterranean” religious term accepted in both Greek and Semitic and that the notion of “house of God” was merely a folk etymology. Emily Vermeule wrote in 1979:
These Bronze Age patterns of thought and representation, the tomb as a house for the body, the soul in a new home, the mourning in files and beside the coffin or bier, the psyche, the soul-bird and the sphinx-ker- were not all developed spontaneously on the Greek mainland, without influence from abroad. The natural source for such influence was Egypt, which had the grandest, most monumental, and the most detailed funerary tradition in the ancient



428 BLACK ATHENA
world. The mechanics of transmitting some of the Egyptian ideas and some physical forms to Greece is not at all clear yet.17
In this context it is not surprising that the Greek vocabulary of death in all its aspects, and with tombs in particular, was heavily influenced by Egyptian. The derivation of puramiv" from pÅ mr “the pyramid” was proposed in Chapter 9.18 In Chapter 5, I argued that sw'ma/ swvmato" “corpse” and sh'ma/shvmato" “tomb,” both came from the Egyptian smÅ tÅ “unite (with) the earth.”19 In Volume 2, I discussed the derivation of Labúrinthos from Ny-mÅŒ t-RŒ the prenomen of the pharaoh Amenemhe III for whom the first labyrinth was built.20 The meaning of pevlton is not known precisely but the general sense is clear enough: “base of an altar, tomb, platform for a sarcophagous.” Chantraine sees it as a loan, probably from Anatolia because it was at
tested there. It can be more plausibly derived from *pÅ rdw i i (O.40)
“the stairs, steps, or tomb shaft.” Rwdw or rwdwy with the same meaning and determinative provides a plausible etymology for loivth (5CE) “tomb,” and loiteuvein “to bury.”21 Chantraine describes it as cognate to the Old Norse causative of the verb lid–@a “to depart,” leid@a“to lead, bury.” Both etymologies are possible, but given the greater precision and the parallel with pélton the Egyptian is more likely. Orel and Stolbova reconstruct an Afroasiatic root *kahVp “hole, cavern.” Given the acknowledged shift ky>t, they see the Egyptian tph≥t “hole, cavern” as a metathesis of this. The discrepancy is better explained as graphic and the clumsiness of writing *th≥pt in hieroglyphics.22 The word may in fact have become pronounced as tph≥t later tph≥t. Both of these forms appear to have been loaned into Greek. Qavptw (H) is “to bury, hold funerary rites”; tavfo" (H) is “funeral, tomb,” and tavfro" (H) is “ditch.” The alternating aspiration fits the uncertainty of t-/t- and the position of the /h≥/. Pokorny saw an Indo-European root *dhmb`h which he agrees only occurs in Greek and Armenian.23 The alleged Armenian cognate is damban, dambaran “tomb grave.” James Clackson, in The Linguistic Relationship between Armenian and Greek, points out that the words only appear in Post-Classical Armenian and that earlier texts used different words. He concludes, “The late and scanty attestation of the Armenian words casts doubt upon the comparison.”24 Hence, there is little reason to suppose that taphos ever contained a nasal. This, of course, is not the case with tuvmbo" (H). Scholars have tended



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 429
to distinguish between taphos as a hole and tumbos as a mound and not to have associated the two.25Tumbos appears to have strong Indo-European roots found in the Latin tumulus and the Middle Irish tomm and others related in turn to a root for “swell.” As for taphos, the religious reforms of Josiah king of Judah included the desecration of the “Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so that no one might make his son or daughter pass through the fire in honour of Molech.”26 The name to–pet, Tophet (transcribed with a f in the Septuagint), is isolated in Hebrew and it could well be taken from the Egyptian tph≥t <tph≥t “hole, cavern.”27 The Greek tevfra– (H) is “ash, but particularly that of burnt corpses.” Similarly, thapto\ included funerals with cremation as well as burial. Although such sacrificial burnings may have happened in Egypt, they certainly did not play the central role they did in Canaanite culture. Therefore, the loan is probably from the latter language. Chantraine and other lexicographers derive it from a hypothetical root *dhegwh found in the Sanskrit dàhati, Lithuanian degù, Tocharian A tsäk etc. Phonetics make it difficult to fit tephra into this cluster. The most detailed description of the term discussed in this section is as “a throne on a raised platform with a canopy.”28 It had generally the
determinative i (O40) but there is an instance of its being j (Q2)
“seat.” The foundational lexicographers of Ancient Egyptian, Adolph Erman and Hermann Grapow, demonstrated that it was first spelled tntÅt and only later tntÅt. Later scholars have used the latter form. It is a word with many variant writings because of graphic transpositions for elegance that are particularly frequent with signs representing birds.29
Of the eleven examples cited by Faulkner and Lesko, six begin with tÅ ;
(G47) and only four place it after the t/t n.30 Thus, instead of the awkward tntÅt it would seem simpler to see the first half of tÅ as reduplicating the initial t. Lesko cites a variant tÅtn, which, however, involves metathesis and *tÅnt, would seem more likely. It would also explain the abbreviated synonym tˆt “dais.” As the semantic match is exact, *tÅnt would provide a good etymology for qrovno" “throne,” which also sometimes had the sense of “dais, platform.”31 Chantraine sees two Mycenaean precedents: tono, which he equates with qovrno", and toronowoko “maker of thrones.” His attempt at an etymology is to attach a suffix -ovno" to a supposed Indo-European root *dher “to support, carry.” More sensibly he links thronos to qra'no" “plank, bench, throne.” In Late Egyptian tqs or tks was “to pierce” with an extended meaning



430 BLACK ATHENA
“to pin down, fix.” and from there in the Coptic to\ks (S) tho\ks (B) “thing firmly fixed, seat.” In Demotic tks meant “throne.” CeËrny describes the resemblance to the Greek qa'ko", qw'ko" “chair” as purely accidental. Can we be so sure? Both Frisk and Chantraine provide possible explanations for the alternation qa/qw but make no suggestions as to the etymology itself.
PERSONNEL
Given the Greek association of priests with Egypt it is not surprising that ˆerov" “sacred” and iJereuv" “priest” should have Egyptian etymologies. They are attested early in the Linear B ijero, Dorian iJarov", Northeast ijrov" and ijereu, iJareuv" etc. The lexicographers make the natural assumption that hiereús is hierós with the suffix -eus “the one who” deals with the holy.32 It may be, however, that (h)ierós derives from (h)iereus rather than the other way round, and -eus or rather -w was present in an Egyptian etymon. Frisk and Chantraine see (h)ierós as a crossing of two Indo-European roots: the first *wis “force,” found in the Sanskrit icxirá “strength” and another from the “substrate,” found in the Etruscan aesar “god.” Thus for them there is no doubt that the original form was unaspirated. A number of Middle Egyptian words overlap with (h)ierós in both phonetics and semantics, including ˆÅˆ “adore, praise” and ˆÅw “adoration,” ˆÅt in Late Egyptian ˆÅwt “office, official.”33 These may have been contaminated by ˆrˆ “do, act, act as an official” or “celebrate a festival.”34 Then there are ˆÅw, “old man” and ˆÅyt “old woman.” This form would provide a good etymology for ijereja “priestess.” Szemerényi argued, on the basis of this Mycenaean form, that it cannot have derived from *-ew-ya but must have been *es-ya. He went further and maintained that, therefore, in all cases -eu- was originally *es-u.35 The original argument on the difficulty of deriving -eja from *-ew-ya is convincing but given a derivation from ˆÅyt there would be no need to postulate an -s- in ijereja let alone for the suffix -eus as a whole. Another player in the development of ajlhvtwr or lhvtwr (5) “priest,” may be ˆÅt “office, function, official, functionary.” In the last chapter, I discussed ajluvta–", the title of an Elian functionary, of police and the games.36 The Semitic root found in the Ugaritic <dr and the Arabic <adara “help, succor” became <åzar in Hebrew, making a Canaanite form a



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 431
strong etymon for the Greek ajossevw (H) “to aid, bring help.” Chantraine suggests that it may be linked to a meaning of o[zo" (H) properly translated “companion” and from this to a[ozo" “servant of a god” from a root ÷sm`“same.” A Semitic origin for all of these seems more probable. zakovro" Mycenaean dakoro means “temple servant.” In Arabic, Sabaean and Ugaritic ÷dkr means “man.” The Hebrew zakûr, or zåkår signified “a man competent to worship and attend feasts.” Frisk and Chantraine draw a parallel of zakómos with the term new-kovro" (5) “temple attendant.” They see the prefix as either dia- “throughout” or za-, a mysterious intensifying particle. Could it be that the later neo\koros was derived from a folk etymology for zakóros? H{bh (H) meant “puberty, youth vigor, pleasure.” It also had a precise sense of the age of 16. Its best-known form with a preposition was e[fhbo" “ephebe,” someone who had reached the age of manhood, 18 in Athens. Chantraine writes about the word’s etymology, “Even though the Baltic [form] is distant and . . . there is no other attestation in an IndoEuropean language, it is not absurd to link it, as is conventional, to the Lithuanian jegà and Latvian jega [strength].” It would seem far simpler to derive it from the Egyptian  ̇b “festival, celebration.” The Coptic hop “feast, marriage celebration” and to see it as reflecting a ritual around puberty. Chantraine links the name of Herakles’ wife H{bh to heb–e.–It seems more plausible to accept the hypothesis of Paul Kretschmer that the name derives from H°epat, the wife of the Hurrian God Tes=s=ub.37 The Afroasiatic root *koz means “knot, unite.”38 The Egyptian form ÷ts was extremely ramified. Concretely, it meant “knot, cord, fillet wreath” and was the probable origin of quvsano" (H) “tassel, fringe.” Chantraine sees a “technical suffix” -ano" but provides no etymology for the stem. I discussed the verb tasso\(takh-) “to range, arrange” in connection with tÅß in Chapter 8.39 I see it as having been confused with ts in the sense of “marshal troops, order and arrange.” Tst, a “troop, gang of workmen, requisitioned labor” or “people,” was discussed in the last chapter.40 With different writing it may have meant “station in life.” This provides an etymology for qhv"-qhtov" (H) “salaried worker,” although sometimes the word means “slave.” As argued in Chapter 5, tsw “commander, protector of the poor” was borrowed into Greek as Qhseuv", Theseus the “national” hero and organizer of Athens.41 Ts was also employed in a specific religious sense of “arrange rites.”



432 BLACK ATHENA
This may well be the origin of the verb qu—vw in the sense “to make religious offerings.” Frisk and Chantraine see it as cognate with the Sanskrit dhu\ma and the Latin fu\mus “smoke.” They have constructed a root *dhw-i–in which the -m is a suffix. They maintain that all the early uses of the verb refer to burnt offerings and only later was it employed more generally for all kinds of sacrifices, offerings and even celebrations. As burnt offerings were the sacrifices of choice in the Homeric epics, it is difficult to be certain about this assertion.
We shall now turn to another meaning of thy\ov\, one that is generally considered to be distinct but which I believe to be related. The general sense of ts is “to knot together, unite,” just as “bind” is “bound” to “band.” The Greek qivaso" (5) “a group, or religious community” was particularly associated with the cult of Dionysos and with the wild Thuîai, Thuiádes, Mainads or Bakchai. As Michael Astour has shown, the Bakchai derive their name from the Semitic root ÷bky “weep, wail.”42 Here there is a parallel with the Late Egyptian tsw “female mourner, one of a band?” The Thuîai and Thuiádes belong to a word cluster generally seen under the verb qu:ˇw in the sense of “rush wildly with fury.” Chantraine sees the derived form qu:nˇw as the result of a present infix -nbut other derivatives, such as those with an -i-, lead him to conclude that there was a Greek theme qus-, which brings us back to ts and the strong
possibility that, through it, the two meanings of thy\ov\can be brought together. Neither Bomhard nor Dolgopolsky list the root *k’at’ *k’ut’ in Nostratic. This is probably because it breaks the rule in Indo-European that no two glottalized consonants can occur in the same root.43 Exceptions always exist, however, especially when they may be influenced by onomatopoeia. In any event, it is difficult to attribute the Scandinavian kutte, English “cut” to the French couteau “knife.” The root qat/`qut`“cut” is well established in Afroasiatic.44 Even beyond Nostratic it has become a favorite of global etymologists. It is found in Nilo-Saharan and Niger Congo *kut, as well as in the Archaic Chinese *kat and Vietnamese cat.45 Within Afroasiatic, the /t/`t became /s/` in Canaanite and Aramaic. Thus, the biliteral ÷qs`with a number of different finals signifies “cut, break off ” and the thing cut or broken off as “end, extremity.” For instance, the Semitic root ÷qsb` is found in the Aramaic qaså`b “butcher.” This provides a plausible etymology for kosub(avt)a–", the title of a sacrificer at Gortina. Chantraine finds the word “obscure” but possibly derived from



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 433
kosuvmbh (3) “fringe or shaggy coat,” the functionary could have been wearing. On the other hand, ÷qsb` means “to cut off ” and specifically “to shear sheep” but it also was used to mean “extremity.” Thus qaså`b and the later Hebrew qåsa`b provide strong etymologies for both kosub(át)a@s and kosumbe.
CULT OBJECTS
The Egyptian origin of a number of these—Ajnaktovrion and Ajqhvrhas been discussed above.46 We will return to them at the end of this chapter, in the section on the Eleusinian Mysteries where we will also discuss kavlaqo" and kivsth.
The Semitic root ÷bll is “to mix, alloy.” The Hebrew bålal “to mix with oil,” a sacrificial term, is only attested in the Piel causative conjugation bile–l. This is a plausible etymon for fiavlh or fievlh pia2ra “flat
basin for warming liquid.” Chantraine writes, “probably a borrowing.” In 1928 Heinrich Lewy proposed that the Later Hebrew gole–l “a stone placed on top of a burial cave” was the origin of guvllo" (Hskh) “four-cornered stone carried on processions for Apollo.”47 Chantraine merely writes “Mediterranean.” Both Michael Astour and John Pairman Brown have shown in detail that the quvrso" (5) “staff entwined with ivy and vine, associated with Bacchic rituals,” derived from a West Semitic word tiro–s=“sweet wine,” also meaning “vine stock.” This apparently gives us truvx “sweet wine.”48 Chantraine sees thyrsos as a loan, probably from the hieroglyphic Hittite tuwarsa “vine stock.” Whether or not this was the source of the Greek term, Astour has argued that the Late Hittite word itself came from Semitic, a tiqta`l form of ÷yrs=“trample down.” Szemerényi plausibly derives the Greek ktevra" (H) “present< offering to the dead” from the Semitic root found in the Akkadian kiteru as in the term ina kiteru “give a grant.”49 Hr° is one of the many Egyptian synonyms for “tomb, necropolis.” This fits well with chlov" (H) “coffer, sarcophagus.” Chantraine provides no clear etymology. The Egyptian swÅh≥ is “to make to endure, last long.” This provides the solution to the double meaning of sorov" (H) “funerary urn, sarcophagus” and “old man or woman.” Chantraine relates soros to the Lithuanian tveriu “to surround, seize.”

RITUALS
The basic sense of wh≥m Coptic ouohm (SB) ouoh–em (B) is “to repeat.” It has, however, extended meanings of “to explain, interpret, announce, chant.” Wh≥myt is thought to mean “continued howling.” This is a persuasive etymon for oi[mh (H) “chant, poem, recital.” On the basis of the composite form froivmion, prooivmion is more common. Chantraine argues that it was originally aspirated. This better fits the etymology made by other scholars from a root found in the Old Norse seiÎr “magic” and the Sanskrit sa\man “chant.” Chantraine does not commit himself. Wh≥m also provides an etymology for ojmfhv (H) “divine voice, chant.” Chantraine describes it as an “old isolated word.” He sees it as deriving from a hypothetical *songwa, related to the Gothic saggws “chant, music” and the general Germanic “to sing.” This is possible, despite slight difficulties with vocalization and the lack of aspiration of omphe\. Nevertheless it is much more cumbersome than the Egyptian etymology. With some uncertainty, Chantraine sets out the following possible Indo-European cognates for ajrav (H) “to pray, vow, curse”: the Armenian uranam “to deny,” the Hittite ariya- “to question an oracle” and the Latin o\ro\ “to pray.” The Egyptian ˆrˆ had the sense “to recite a spell, swear an oath, celebrate a festival.” In Coptic different forms in different dialects had different vocalizations.50 These could explain the Hittite, Latin and Greek etymologies. [Iakco" was a ritual cry invoking Dionysos at Eleusis and Athens. Chantraine tries to link it to hjchv“noise.” In her Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion Jane Harrison wrote, “How many people attach any precise significance to the thrice repeated . . . Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia? . . . They are a homage beyond articulate speech . . . ‘the Iacchos’ was a ritual cry, one easily recognized by an Athenian just as nowadays we should recognize Alleluia and Hosanna.”51 Michael Astour comments on this passage that in Hebrew Alleluia and Hosanna had very specific meanings. In the case of Iakkhos, he writes that the vocative iakkhe corresponds well to the Piel imperative of the verb nky “to strike” which is yakke “to strike, kill.”52 This meaning fits well with the Dionysian ritual in which it was shouted. Ejleuvqero"—ereutero—“liberty” in Homer had the sense of ejleuvqeron h|mar “day of ‘freedom,’” or krhth'ra ejleuvqeron “drinking bowl of freedom.” It appears initially to have been a temporary state associated with



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 435
a festival and drinking. In this way it resembles the Latin li\bevrta\s, which is
clearly derived from the Italic god Lib–ver, who was seen as the equivalent of Dionysos and Bakkhos, the gods of orgies and drinking. Naturally,
scholars have tried to link eleutheros with li\bevr and have found possible intermediate forms loufir and loferta from other Italic languages. They have also attempted to link it to the Germanic and Slav liut “people” and to a possible Indo-European root for “to grow, swell” found in the Sanskrit rudh-.53 Chantraine is dissatisfied with all of these. An alternative suggestion is that eleutheros could derive from ˆr(t) h°Åwt, a form attested in Late Egyptian meaning “to celebrate, keep festival.”
If this etymology is uncertain, that of the Latin Li–vber and li\bevr is more clear. The Egyptian rmˆ/w, Coptic rime (S) rimi (B) “to weep” is
reconstructed by Vicychl as *rimv–i. The initial r- derives from an Afroasiatic /l/ indicating that without an Egyptian letter “l” the pronunciation was probably *limi.54 This provides a suitable origin for leivbw (H) “to pour drop by drop, notably of tears, honey, oil or wine” and ei[bw (H) “to
shed tears.” Leibo\is, of course, cognate to the Latin li\bvo\“to make a libation.”55 Rmw with the personal suffix -w is “weeper” in Egyptian. Similarly, Li–vber, also written Leiber, had the personal suffix -er. Li–vber was assimilated with Bakchos, båkûy “bewailed” in Western Semitic. As Astour points out “weeping for dying gods was the essential rite of their [southwest Asian] liturgy.” The Book of Ezekiel refers to women wailing for Tammuz at the northern gate of the temple at Jerusalem.56 In a partially secularized and masculinized version this survives today as the Wailing Wall. Astour’s case is clinched by the close association of Bakkhos with Pentheus whose name comes from the verb penqevw (H) “to be in mourning, bewail a dead person.” In Chapter 10 I tentatively proposed an origin from the Egyptian bÅ ntr.57 As the poet and scholar Gail Holst-Warhaft has shown, mourning is a period when people, especially women, can express themselves freely, noisily and wildly because in this agony they lose fear.58 The Bible records the story of Jephtah who, when forced by a vow to sacrifice his daughter, granted her wish: “to roam in the hills with my companions to mourn that I must die a virgin . . . it became a tradition that the daughters of Israel should go year by year and commemorate the fate of Jephtah’s daughter four days in every year.”59 In Greece there were the bloody dramas of the Bakkhai, wild women roaming the hills free in their wail
ing concerned with Pentheus and Bakkhos. Thus li\bevrta\s like eleutheros,



436 BLACK ATHENA
was initially associated with license and the possibility of temporary freedom in mourning, or its routinized commemoration, and drunken festivals. Egyptian women were famous for their passionate mourning.60 The standard Egyptian term for this was ˆÅkb; it was written with the deter
minative P (D3) “hair.” The derivation from “tearing the hair,” is made
clear by the determinative of a woman tearing her hair for ˆÅkbyt “mourning woman.” This provides a good source for ejlegaivnw (6) “wild, wrathful, wanton.” The etymology has to be early because already in Late Egyptian it was being written as ikb. This presents a slight difficulty in that we do not know when /b/ became a fricative and thus likely to
disappear. E[lego" was a “song of mourning.” The diminution of women’s rights brought an attempt to tame mourning and to have it controlled by men in the ejlegei`on “elegy,” spoken in a male voice. None of these words have an Indo-European etymology. The derivation of the suffix -mbo" “dance, sing” from the Egyptian ibÅ “intoxicated dance” was set out in Chapter 15.61 In Chapter 15 I discussed the origins of e[rano" (H) “a religious feast to which everyone brings a portion,” from ˆÅm “to bind for sacrifice” ˆÅm n “to offer to” and eJorthv (H) “festival” and eJortikov" “offerings given at festivals” from h≥Åw ht° “special offering” or h≥Åw-h≥r ht° “abundance of offerings.”62 Orel and Stolbova list a root *seb “flow, pour” found in Semitic and East Chadic.63 Although not included, the Egyptian sbt “libation jar” is a likely member of this family. It provides a reasonable etymon for spevndw (H) “make a libation. “ Chantraine finds Indo-European cognates in only two other languages: the Hittite sipand “to make a libation” and the Latin spondeo\“guarantee.” All three could be borrowings from Afroasiatic. Sthvnia (4) were the crude insults women hurled at each other on the third day before the Thesmorphoria. Chantraine sees the etymology as obscure. The obscurity is cleared by considering the two hapakes in the Bible: svit`nåh “accusation,” svit‘nåh “hostility,” svåtan “to act as an adversary.” Of course, there is svåtån “The Adversary” rendered Satavn as a loan and Diabovlo" as a calque. S(Å)t was “to make libation, pour out”; stavzw (H) is “to pour out drop by drop.” Chantraine rejects previous attempts to find IndoEuropean etyma. He sees stalavssw (6) “drip” as an expressive form of stazo.–Clearly, -asso i–s a suffix but *stal could be a metathesis *stÅ?



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 437
SACRIFICES
jAgaio", a sacrificial epithet in the regulations of the Labyad phratry at Delphi, have been discussed above, as has Ai[glh with a general meaning of “radiance.” The latter was also the specific name of a sacrifice at Delphi.64 The derivation of oujlaiv (H) “grains of barley put on head of sacrifice,” from the Egyptian wÅˆ “roasted? grains” and that of aujchvn “neck of men or animals” from ws=n “wring the neck of poultry” were discussed above.65 Mwy(t) Demotic mÅt Coptic me\“urine, spittle, sometimes excrement” is a plausible etymon for miaivnw (H) “soiled by blood spilled” and muvso" (5) “soiled, sacrilege.” Chantraine has no explanation. Chapter 15 also contained a discussion of the derivations of ma:ˇnh" “a sort of cup,” ajmnivon “a vase to receive the blood of sacrifice” and mwvi>on “box jar” from mnˆ “jar.”66 The Hebrew mûm or m>ûm means “flaw or blemish in a woman or sacrificial animal.” The Greek mw'mo" (H) is “criticism, defect or fault.”67 There is a late but striking structural parallel to the correspondence mûm/ mo\mos in the Canaanite mûq and the Greek mw'ko" (4) “mock,” which has no Indo-European etymology. Chantraine sharply distinguishes mo\mos and its derivatives from mevmfomai (H) “blame, reproach” because mo\mos is not merely concerned with the criticism but with the flaw itself. The discrimination seems to me too refined. In any event, Chantraine considers the Indo-European etymology for mémphomai linking it to the Gothic bimampian “insult, to be doubtful.” Saul Levin argues that both the Semitic and the Greek words must be borrowed from a third language because “neither IE nor Semitic has verbal roots that consist of the same consonant pronounced twice.”68 This may be true but there are many Semitic nouns with this structure: the Arabic bab “gate,” the Canaanite gåg “roof,” dad “breast” and the fundamental layil, lailåh “night.” Thus mûm as a noun would seem perfectly permissible in Semitic. The Greek o{sio" (H) was “sanctioned by divine law.” Hosiot\e\rvwas a “perfect animal fit for sacrifice.” The Hosíoi were priests at Delphi who were concerned with such animals and hosioo\was “to consecrate, purify.” Jane Harrison considered this word and the cluster around it as central to Orphism and later Greek religion. She wrote about these terms, “The animal thus consecrated was called Hosioter which means “he who



438 BLACK ATHENA
consecrated.” We should expect such a name to be applied to the consecrating priest rather than the victim. . . . We can only explain Hosioter on the supposition that the sacrificial victim was regarded as an incarnation of the god. If the victim was a bull. . . .”69 Pokorny, following Brugmann, derives hos- from the Indo-European *es “to be.” Frisk and Chantraine find this “unpersuasive.” A much more precise etymology on both phonetic and semantic grounds is from the Egyptian verbs  ̇sˆ “to sing,” and  ̇s(z)ˆ “to praise.”70 Kurt Sethe and Jaroslav CeËrny made a sharp distinction between the two roots, because of their voiced and unvoiced sibilants.71 Given the slight phonetic difference and the worldwide association between singing and praise, I find it hard to imagine that the two are unrelated. In any event they were treated as one in Late Egyptian. The Coptic form ho\s is “to sing, make music, praise.” This with the final -i, found in the earlier forms provides a good etymology for hósios.72 Still more interesting is the Egyptian h≥sy, the Coptic hasie or esie “drowned or praised person.” The latter was recorded in Greek as jEsih'" “Egyptian for praised dead.”73 An alternative version of the Osiris myth has him not struck down by Seth but drowned by him. Incidentally, this tradition was central to the “mysterious” drowning of Hadrian’s lover Antinoos.74 The tradition is clearly very ancient and is linked to Osiris’ identification with the Nile flood, which is attested in the Pyramid Texts.75 In Ptolemaic times this aspect of the god was linked to his incarnation as the Apis Bull.76 Thus, hasie “the praised one” almost certainly referred to Osiris and the Delphic hosiot\e\r,vHarrison’s “sacrificial victim regarded as the reincarnation of the god” usually a bull. Elsewhere, Plutarch mentioned the bull-shaped images of Dionysos.77 The idea of a Hellenized Osiran bull cult at Delphi should not be dismissed out of hand. The second-century (CE) novelist Heliodoros was describing the curiosity of Delphic priests when he wrote: “Everything relating to that country [Egypt] has a special charm for the Greeks.”78 The Semitic root ÷Œrt ≥ preserved as such in Ugaritic, signified “terror,
to terrify.” In Hebrew it became ÷Œrs.`It was loaned into Egyptian as *o–rit ≥u.79 Either this or its Semitic prototype provides a good etymology
for ojrecqevw (H) the “bellowing or palpitating of sacrificed bulls”; the /khth/ represents the complex Semitic /t ≥/. Chantraine denies any as
sociation with rjocqevw (H) “to bellow, moo.” He lists some “expressive terms for noise” rjovqo", rJoi`zo" and rJoi`bdo" and then some with similar finals brovcqo" and movcqo". None of these, he states, have etymologies.



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 439
This does indeed seem like a good example of the “phonesthemics” or semantic associations with sounds, discussed in Chapter 1.80 Nevertheless, the existence of *o–rit ≥u suggests that orekhtheo\and rokhtheo\are at the
core of the cluster. Jernstedt suggested that a hypothetical combination *st rqh≥(t) (Coptic rok–h or rekh) “place of burning” provided an etymon for ejscavra– (H) “low hearth for sacrifice.” In the complete absence of an alternative, Jernstedt’s hypothesis is plausible.81 I have already discussed the derivations of basuniva" “cake associated with sacrifice” from *pÅ/snw “food offerings”; librov" the “dark blood of sacrifice” from leibo–“to pour” and rmˆ “to weep”; sfavzw “sacrifice by cutting the throat” from ÷spk “trickle water, shed blood” and qoivnh “festival following sacrifice,” from dnˆt “festival.”82
INCENSE, FLOWERS, SCENTS
A[nqo" and other derivations from ntr were discussed in Chapter 10 as was xavnqo" “fragrance” from sntr.83 For the Semitic origins of lhdanon “laudanum” and muvrra “myrrh,” see Chapter 14.84 For nevktar see Chapter 11.85
AURA
This vague concept covers a number of terms with plausible Afroasiatic etymologies that were considered in previous chapters: foi'bo", a[nqo", xavnqo", kaqarov" and ku'do".86 The Canaanite hågåh means “to remove dross or impurities or impure people.” A[go" (5) is “consecration, a religious interdict that strikes the guilty.” The lexicographers are naturally intrigued by the apparently close parallels with a{gio" (5) “sacred,” a{zomai (H) “to experience religious awe” and a{gno" (H), and Ajgaio". SÅh°is a causative of the verb Åh°“to become a spirit” and the adjective “glorious, splendid.” SÅh°itself is “to glorify [a god], beautify [a tomb].” This provides a strong etymology for the Greek sevla~ (H) “flash, brilliant light.” As Chantraine points out, the origin of this word like all others beginning with s- is “ambiguous.” He dismisses the proposals listed by Frisk. Frisk and Chantraine agree that selhvnh (H) “moon” derives from selas.
These two terms are close to the Hebrew hågîn or Aramaic ha=gan



440 BLACK ATHENA
“suitable, worthy.”87 Chantraine would like to link them all to the Latin sacer though he is troubled by the lack of aspiration of ágos. The weakness of the Canaanite /h/, as opposed to /h≥/, would explain the alternation of aspiration in Greek. Ernout and Meillet are less interested in the relation between sacer and házomai than they are between the former and san–ctum. They see the /n/ as an infix. If san–ctum is the base form rather than merely the past participle of sancio i–t would seem more plausible to derive it from sntr/xánthos than from the mysterious sacer. Ernout and Meillet conclude their lemma on sancio:
The linking of the Greek words with the Indo-Iranian family and the Sanskrit yájati “he sacrifices” is not good for either the form or the sense. Anyhow the Latin sancio,–the Gothic sakan and the Greek a{zomai do not possess precise enough parallels of sense or form to authorize an affirmation. It is curious that no word for the concept of sacred is attested throughout Indo-European. The strictly religious vocabulary varies greatly from one Indo-European language to another.
In the case of Greek this can be plausibly explained by the borrowings in this semantic field from Afroasiatic languages. It seems reasonable therefore to propose a Canaanite origin for the Greek ágos, hágios, hágnos and házomai.
The name Stuvx Styx, the river of death, applied to a cold stream in Arkadia, came from the verb stugevw (H) “to be horrified, revolted” and the adjective stugnov" “hateful, abominable.” Stkn, a causative of tkn “approach” developed the specific sense of “to induct, bring on gloom, execute.” The Egyptian source is much more plausible than Chantraine’s
link to the Russian stygvnuti “to refresh, freeze.”88 The Egyptian s=ps(s) “noble, splendid, august” was frequently used as an epithet for gods and provides a plausible etymology for sevbomai (H) “show a respectful fear” or a “religious respect, usually of the gods.”89 Accepting the Egyptian etymology would mean that what the lexicographers see as a derived noun sevba" (H) “religious respect, adoration.” Coming from this is the verb with an aorist form sebavssato (H). The adjective eujsebhv" “pious, respectful of the gods and their laws” should also be seen as preserving an original -s. A derived form semnov" from *sebnov" “venerable, who inspires religious respect mixed with fear” was used of many divinities, especially Demeter and the Furies. It is interesting in this respect that s=ps only survived into Coptic in the feminine form



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 441
s=apsi= from the earlier s=pst “noble lady.”90 The Coptic vocalization stressed /á/ indicates a stressed /é/ in Late Egyptian.91 Following a tradition going back to Brugmann, Chantraine sees the basic meaning as “retiring,” and, therefore, the form as cognate with the Sanskrit tyájati “to leave, abandon.” Not surprisingly, Hjalmar Frisk and the very sensible lexicographer of Sanskrit, Manfred Mayrhofer, have their doubts. Another later derivative of s=ps with the vocalization -a- would seem to be the divine epithet Sabavzio" or Sabo". In Phrygia, Zeus Sabazios was worshipped. In Thrace the epiklesis was attached to Dionysos. In the early twentieth century, A. B. Cook saw parallels between the Libyan Zeus Asbystes and Sabazios in Phrygia and Thrace. On this and a number of other grounds, he proposed a Thrako-Phrygio-Lybian substratum.92 As argued above, there were clear contacts between Egypt and the Northern Aegean before the region was penetrated by Greek culture.93
MYSTERIES
WÅg and ojrg
The Egyptian wÅg meant “to shout” and “a religious festival.”94 WÅg is clearly related through palatalization to wÅd “green, make green, flourish” applied to the Delta after the flood. The term was encountered in Chapter 9 in connection with Pr wÅdyt Aphrodite.95 The Greek cluster of words beginning with jorg- covers a remarkably similar semantic field. jOrghv (H) “passion, anger, temperament,” especially “the changeable moods of women.” Another use of orge\is found in a hapax that appears to mean, “sacred land.” jOrgavw (5) “to be full of sap or vigor” is said of fertile land or growing plants. jOrgav" was “wellwatered but generally not cultivated land” and hJ jOrgav" “the Orgas” was a stretch of fertile, but unworked, land around Eleusis. This land was sacred to Demeter and otherwise known as the Rharian plain; the possible derivation of this form from r-Åh≥t was mentioned in Chapter 9.96 Conventionally orge,\ orgao\and orgas are supposed to be cognate to the
Sanskrit, u–rja\v“food, vigor.” Chantraine claims that there is a parallel to the developed meaning of “anger” in the Irish ferc. He admits, however, that Szemerényi has produced strong arguments against the derivation
from u–rja.\v97 On the other hand, Chantraine considers as “risky” Szemerényi’s etymology of orge\from ojrevgw “to stretch out one’s arms, desire.”



442 BLACK ATHENA
In short, Indo-Europeanists are very uncertain about this issue. The Egyptian etymology is not only tighter in both semantics and phonetics, but it encompasses the wide range of meanings of the Greek stem. {Orgia (6) were religious rites, found particularly in the mysteries of Demeter and other divinities, all with orgiastic aspects. The ancients recognized the close similarities with orge\in both sound and meaning, but Frisk and Chantraine derive it from a completely different IndoEuropean root *werg “work.” While this does undoubtedly have Greek cognates in o[rganon “instrument” e[rgon and e[rdw “work,” to include orgia in this cluster is far-fetched in both phonetics and semantics. It should clearly be related to orge.\ Finally, [orgon “a member of an Athenian religious association” should also be placed with orge\with its Attic and Eleusinian connections. The similarities between orge\and orgia, on the one hand, and WÅg on the other are brought out in a description of the Egyptian festival:
The WÅg festival celebrated on the seventeenth day of the first month of the flood was given over to drinking in honor of the god and it is certain that the wine here was placed in relation to the fertilizing water of the Nile. . . . Osiris was represented under a kiosk adorned with vine leaves and sheltered by a vine. It can be concluded that the wine . . . had a mystic sense. . . . It is the liquor of immortality given by Osiris to revive the dead.98
The erudite Nonnos described a feast held by Dionysos after the death of Staphylos, whose name can be translated as “grape,” and the latter’s revival in his son Botrys “bunch of grapes.” He drew parallels with this both to the cult at Eleusis and to JUakivnqia at Amyklai.99 The etymology of Hyakinthia from *WÅg ntr after /Å/ had lost its consonantal force is discussed in Chapter 21.100 Mysteries are by definition mysterious and are seldom if ever described directly. The only two detailed descriptions of Egyptian initiations available to contemporary scholars come from the Roman period. The first is contained in a description in the Latin novel The Golden Ass, written by the North African author Apuleius. It deals with the initiation of the hero Lucius to the goddess Isis that took place in Greece. In her critique of my belief in the Egyptian foundation of much of the Greek mystery system, Mary Lefkowitz agrees that there were “Egyptian elements in Apuleius’s ritual.” She continues, “But there is a characteristic difference



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 443
in timing: Lucius is initiated while alive; the Egyptian reciter of the scroll will be allowed to cross the threshold after his death.”101 Against this widely held view, the German Egyptologist and historian of memory Jan Assmann wrote an important article entitled “Death and Initiation in the Funerary Religion of Ancient Egypt.” After a survey of Pharaonic texts and Apuleius’ description of Lucius’ initiation to Isis, Assmann begins the conclusion of this essay:
No one doubts that the initiation rites of the Isis Mysteries, as Apuleius describes them, are deeply rooted in the elaborated rituals and conceptions of Egyptian funerary religion. The same holds true for other initiation rituals. Seen from this aspect, a relationship between death and initiation is not disputed. A number of clues listed in this survey, however, have given us reason to look in the opposite direction. Let us attempt to formulate our results into a hypothesis: the funerary rites take the form of an “initiation into the mysteries of the underworld” . . . because they reflect the corresponding rites and conceptions of cultic rituals in “this” world, of which, for obvious reasons, we know next to nothing.102
I do not go as far as Assmann in claiming that funerary rites were based on initiations of the living. Ancient Egyptian initiations and funerary directions, however, were clearly very closely related and the sharp distinction made between the Greek living initiate and the Egyptian dead soul vanishes.103 The second detailed ancient report of a mysterious initiation comes in a papyrus in the cursive Egyptian script Hieratic that describes the initiations of a priest named Horsiesis. The initiation took place in the ancient cult centers of Abydos, Busisris and Karnak.104 The rituals described by Apuleius and Horsiesis share three striking features. First, they appear to be based entirely on Egyptian tradition. Second, many of the passages resemble those found in the Book of the Dead or, to use its original title, Going Forth by Day. Third, they resemble descriptions of many of the rituals practiced in the most famous Greek mysteries, those at Eleusis, northwest of Athens. The skeptical scholar Gwyn Griffiths attempted to reconcile the three parallels. He maintained that the essential theme of spiritual regeneration in the present life was specifically Greek and Eleusinian. Nevertheless, he added, “Yet this may have developed in the Hellenistic era in



444 BLACK ATHENA
Egypt as a development and projection of a very ancient funerary tradition.”105 His position seemed to be that the Greeks and late Egyptians both independently invented spiritual initiations for the living that resembled the journeys of the souls of the dead. A widespread “Egyptomaniac” fantasy that the Greek mysteries had been developed from Egyptian ones then confused the situation and the Greek mysteries were fleshed out by the introduction of some Egyptian ritual. This seems much more cumbersome than simply accepting the ancients’ view, that the Greek mysterious initiations were derived from Egypt. At least at a superficial level, the mystery and initiations in the cult of Demeter at Eleusis resembled those of Osiris at Abydos and other holy centers in Egypt. Furthermore, Egyptian scarabs and a symbol of IsisDemeter was her Greek counterpart—were found in a ninth- or eighthcentury BCE tomb at Eleusis.106 For these reasons, although the majority of classicists deny it, a number of the most distinguished specialists of the twentieth century CE have followed the predominant ancient tradition that the cult of Demeter was imported to Eleusis from Egypt before the Trojan War or during what we now call the Late Bronze Age. Most notable of these was the French classicist Paul Foucart, who dominated Eleusinian studies in the early part of the twentieth century and whose detailed work is still respected, even by the most conventional.107 A later French ancient historian, G. Charles-Picard, is generally supposed to have refuted Foucart. Even he, however, admitted that “well before” the eighth century BCE, the Eleusinian Mysteries were substantially influenced by Egypt.108 In 1971, the British scholar A. A. Barb also saw fundamental connections.109 The firm isolationist Jean Hani admitted, when referring to Isis and Demeter, “it seems that there has always been a type of ‘understanding’ between Greece and Egypt since prehistory.”110 Beyond the evidence from Apuleius and Horsiesis, there is the mysterious underground Cenotaph of Seti the First (c.1309–1291 BCE) or Oseirion. This structure contains complex passages inscribed with broken hieroglyphs and sections of the Book of the Dead, a strange underground island and a hall decorated with the text of a mysterious religious play.111 This place could plausibly be used for initiations. In addition, passages going back to the seventeenth century BCE refer to men who, though alive, were called mÅŒ h°rw “true of voice,” the title generally applied to the immortal dead.112 There is even one from a man who claimed to have taken part in a ritual described in Going Forth by Day.113 Thus, a substantial body of evidence backs Assmann’s contention



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 445
that funerary instructions closely resembled initiations of the living and specifically that Going Forth by Day was sometimes used for such initiations. This evidence also supports the ancient view that the Greek mysteries and the initiations associated with them derived from Egypt. Now to consider the word musthvrion (6) itself. The Indo-European root *mu– means “to close the lips” or stay “mute.” It was reconstructed to explain the Greek mu–vw “keep silent.”114 Keeping silence is certainly an important aspect of mysteries, but this proposed etymology only explains the first syllable of the term. It would seem more plausible to follow the nineteenth-century scholars Jacob Levy and Otto Keller who derived it from the Semitic root ÷str “cover, veil, hide.” As Keller suggested, it is possibly the Canaanite Hophal participle *mastår “caused to be hidden.”115 It is an argument against Keller’s specific proposal that if muste\rion comes from Semitic it is more likely to derive from ÷str with the nominalizing or localizing prefix m-. This is attested in the Hebrew mastêr “hiding, the act of hiding,” misto\r “place of hiding, shelter,” mistår “secret place, hiding place.” The challenge to the Indo-European origin of such a central element in Greek culture caused some anxiety among supporters of the Aryan Model. For an example, see the bullying statement by the nineteenthcentury German Semitist, H. L. Fleischer, “With the indubitably pure Greek origin of the words muvsth" and musthvrion from muevw (muvw), muvzw, it would be better to stop even the mere suggestion of the origin, sometimes sought, of these words from str.”116 In a less “Aryanist” age we can look at other forms of the Semitic str. With the prefix hi- of the hiphil perfect histîr or the Niphal construct infinitive hisater “to be hid, concealed”; str would explain the title uJsthvria given to a festival of Aphrodite in Argos.117 Furthermore, although possibly confused with the Indo-European root *udero “belly,” uJstevra “womb” is more plausibly derived on phonetic grounds from histîr or hisater “hidden.” The Hebrew noun sêter was used specifically to refer to “womb.”118 A connection with the passions of the mysteries provides a better explanation for uJsterikov" “hysterics” than does the folk etymology of the alleged wanderings of the womb. The Latin histerio “actor” is supposed to come from the Etruscan. Whether this is the case or whether it came directly from Phoenician, the connections between mysteries and drama qualify it for this cluster.119 While the words with initial hi- clearly come from Canaanite the origins of myste\rion are not so clear-cut. According to the specialist on



446 BLACK ATHENA
Egyptian religion S. Mayassis, the word comes from the Egyptian root ÷stÅ.120 This is, of course, cognate to ÷str, as is the nominalizing and localizing prefix m-. However, m- also occurred independently as the locative preposition. Thus m stÅ “in secret” is attested.121 The causative sstÅ was central to the Osiran “mystery” cult.122 The derivation of Greek borrowings from hi-str from West Semitic suggests that myste\rion too came from that language. Nevertheless, the overwhelming literary and other evidence connecting the Greek mysteries to Egypt rather than the Levant indicates strongly that it came from mstÅ.
Connections with Egypt can also be found in the special vocabulary. Some of this vocabulary has been discussed in earlier chapters: the Anaktórion, from Œnh,° “small chamber at Eleusis containing the hierá “sa
cred objects” from ˆÅyt and the athe\rv“ear of wheat, in Egypt sacred to Osiris,” from ntr.123 Then there is the possibility that páx the cry at the moment of initiation derives from bs “initiate.”124 Teleth “vinitiation into the mysteries,” came from the root tel- and the Egyptian (r)dr.125 Two other terms central to the Eleusinian mysteries, kavlaqo" (5) and kivsth (H), also have plausible Egyptian etymologies. Émile Chassinat discussed the rites described at the Ptolemaic temple at Denderah, apparently a reliquary from Abydos was used. The reliquary consisted of an ˆnswty “basket of rushes” containing . . . a vase qrh≥t which held the sacred and crowned head of Osiris.126 Clement of Alexandria wrote: “The formula of the Eleusinian mysteries is as follows: I fasted, I drank the draught; I took from the chest kíste\ having done my task I placed in the kálathos ‘basket’ and from the basket into the chest.”127 The inscriptions of the mystery of Osiris at Denderah contain the following passage: “This qrh≥t ‘pot’ is placed in his [the priest’s] hands and he says: ‘I am Horus who comes to your ladyship. I bring you these [things] of my father [Osiris].’”128 Plutarch also referred to a festival that seemed to involve something similar: “On the night of the nineteenth day they go down to the sea and the priests take out the sacred box [kiste\] which has inside a golden casket [kibwvtion]. Into this they pour some drinking water which they have brought with them and the people present shout ‘Osiris has been found.’”129 In the Golden Ass, Apuleius mentioned a priest in the mysterious procession carrying a box, cista, holding “secret things and concealing within it the hidden attributes of the sublime faith.”130 Can kálathos be derived from qrh≥t? Kálathos has a bewildering array of



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 447
meanings. Primarily it is a narrow-based basket carried in rituals of Demeter. It also part of the terminology of the Eleusinian mysteries.131 In the same way krh≥t, as a pot, was used in the Osiran ceremonies recorded at the Ptolemaic temple Denderah.132 Kálathos, however, can also mean “capital of a pillar,” and the diminutive kalathískos is the “coffering or sealing of a room or box.” Another borrowing from qrh≥t would seem to be kavrtallo" (3) a “small pointed basket.” The suffix would seem to be a diminutive. Beyond mentioning a possible relationship to kurtov" “curved,” Chantraine offers no explanation. Chantraine also gives no etymology for kálathos but Pokorny links it to klwvqw “spin.”133 The kálathoi, however, seem to draw their significance not from the material from which they are made but from their shapenarrow at the bottom. This would make it parallel to the qrh≥t.134 The shape is shared with the head of a cobra ∞ (I13) meaning “serpent spirit as guardian,” also qrh≥t. In Coptic the term kalahe–means “breast, stomach or womb.” Vycichl follows Crum in maintaining that it is made up of kala <qrh≥t and he\“belly or womb.” Sauneron, however, believes that kalahe\ is qrh≥t “the womb or egg” of the primordial cobra goddess, from which all life emanates.135 In imperial times many Isiaic baskets, caskets and chests were represented close to snakes. Griffiths plausibly gave these an Egyptian origin.136 Given the semantic parallels and the Coptic phonetic development the derivation of kálathos from qrh≥t seems quite likely. The final -t would be aspirated by the previous /h≥/ The borrowing could have taken place before final -t s were dropped or later re-inserted as an archaism, very common in religious contexts. At this point we should turn to kivsth (H) itself. The normal translation is “basket,” however, it was sometimes made of bark and the loan into Latin cista “box, chest” suggests that these meanings were already present in Greek. The Latin cista—from which descend many Celtic words and Teutonic words, including the English “case,” “chest” and “cist”is generally acknowledged to be a loan from kiste\ probably through Etruscan. The only possible Indo-European cognate for kiste\is the dubious Old Irish form ciss “basket.”137 This too is more likely to be a loan from cista.138 In any event, the better attested Irish word ciste must be a borrowing. Given the religious context, Chantraine is uncertain and concludes that it may be a loan. It is possible that there is also ambiguity among box, hamper or basket on the Afroasiatic side. Orel and Stolbova postulate a root *kic ̈“basket,



448 BLACK ATHENA
container” found in West Chadic and Central and Eastern Cushitic.139 Whether or not it is related, the Egyptian qrst, “burial” qrsw “coffin” and qrstt “funeral equipment” are all written with L (Q6). In Late Egyptian there is qrst “coffin, box-shaped sarcophagus.” Qst is “burial” and “embalmment” in Demotic. Qrsw “coffin” is written kaise, kese (S) and kaisi (B) in Coptic. Vycichil reconstructs a sequence *qirsat > *qiasat. Qrst “burial” became ko\o\s, suggesting an original /a–a–/. Its qualitative or completed form is ke\s.140 Thus either word, at some point in the Late Bronze Age when the final /-t/ was still pronounced, provides good etyma *ke/ist for kiste\.
Eumolpids and Ke\rykes
As is well known Greece had many fewer priests and fewer still priesthoods than did Egypt. At Eleusis, however, there were two important priesthoods—the Eujmolpivde" Eumolpids and the kh'ruke" ke–rykes. The first had an ultimately Semitic name and the second, an Egyptian one. The ancients did not doubt that the cult of Demeter and the mysteries associated with her came from abroad. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter portrays the goddess arriving at Eleusis to be welcomed by the local notables including Eumolpos, the eponymic founder of the family of the Eumolpids, who with the less important clan of the Kerykes provided priests for the cult throughout antiquity.141 On the other hand, Plutarch, Pausanias and Lucian claimed that Eumolpos had come from Thrace to Eleusis to found the cult.142 Apollodoros maintained that the founding priest was brought up in Ethiopia.143 Against these, Diodoros’ Egyptian informants told him that the Eumolpids derived from Egyptian priests and the Kerykes from the lesser rank of the Pastophoroi. These informants also claimed that the mysteries had been introduced to Eleusis by Erekhtheus, whom they saw as the Egyptian king of Attica during his reign c. 1409/8 BCE.144 The Parian Marble agreed with this date. Apollodoros, however, put the arrival of Demeter and Dionysos somewhat earlier during the reign of King Pandion.145 Both dates would fit the apogee of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Despite these differences of opinion, there was no dispute over the identification of Demeter with Isis and Dionysos with Osiris and of the gods’ Greek and Egyptian mysteries. To return to Eumolpos and the Eumolpids: despite the widespread



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 449
attribution of their Thracian origin, they themselves believed they were from Egypt and had preserved Egyptian traditions. It was probably as an expert on Hellenized versions of Egyptian religion that Ptolemy I summoned the Eumolpid Timotheus for consultation on the formationor reformation—of the cult of Serapis.146 Connections between Eumolpos and Egypt are strengthened by the clearly Egyptian origin of Melavmpou". Taking away the prefix eu- and the common nasal dissimilation p>mp leaves the same consonantal structure mlp. The two men also had remarkably similar legendary functions. Melampus, thought to mean “black foot,” was associated with melavmbrote" “Negroes.” The view of Egypt as a land of magic and medicine was almost universal in antiquity. Thus, Melampus as an Egyptian may well be the legendary ancestor of the hero in the Odyssey who was a skilled diviner and understood the language of animals.147 According to Pherekydes and Herodotos, through his ability to cure madness Melampus acquired five-sixths of Argos.148 This claim is very interesting in the light of other traditions referring to the Egypto-Syrian acquisition of the eastern Peloponnese.149 According to Herodotos, Melampus brought the name and worship of Dionysos and, in particular, his phallic processions from Egypt to Greece.150 Clement of Alexandria enlarged on this to write that it was Melampus who introduced the festivals of Demeter and her grief to Greece from Egypt.151 Without the nasal dissimilation mrp/mlp points more to the Levant than to Egypt. Traces of Mevroy, the legendary first king of Kos, Meropivh or Merovph, the skilled healer, are found all over Greece but especially in connection with the worship of Asklhpiov", the origin of whose name from H°prr will be discussed in the next chapter. Michael Astour has provided detailed evidence of their derivation from the West Semitic root ÷rp> “heal” and the attested form mErappe> “healer.”152 He has also connected these to Marapijo, a personal name from Knossos. Oscar Landau, however, sees the name as Melampus or Melampios.153 These explanations are not necessarily exclusive. While the name Melampus may well have been influenced by mélas/mélanos “black” and hence Egyptian. Like Mérops, it probably derived from mErappe>
Melámpus with a nasal dissimilation before the Canaanite shift a\v>o\vand Mérops after it. In the city of Megara, Melampus was thought to have been an early settler and was closely associated with the temple of Dionysos. Nearby in Aijgovsqena, Pausanias reported that Melampus was worshipped as a



450 BLACK ATHENA
god, a claim that has been confirmed by inscriptions.154 The initial element of Aigosthena is aix, aigos “goat.” There is no reason to doubt the belief of the early twentieth-century classicist A. B. Cook that Melampus was a form of Dionysos as a goat and as a healer, especially from madness.155 Megara is only ten miles to the west of Eleusis. Can Eumolpos be linked to Melampus, the Dionysian ecstatic diviner and healer, to Merops also a healer and the Semitic mErappe> ? Paul Foucart derived Eumolpos from melpo\“to dance, sing.” Molpe\and mólpos “singer, musician.” He went further to claim that Eumolpos “good singer” was a calque for mÅŒ hr°w “true of voice,” as discussed above.156 Whether or not this is the case, Pausanias noted a link between mo/elp and Dionysos: “In it [a colonnade near the Temple of Demeter in Athens] too, is the house of Pulytion in which they say some illustrious Athenian parodies the Eleusinian mysteries; but in my time it was consecrated to Dionysos. This Dionysos was called ‘the minstrel Melpomenos.’”157 Although mo/elp sometimes referred to secular music and dance, it was more often associated with ritual and ecstasy. As it has no IndoEuropean etymology, it would seem plausible to derive it from mErappe>.158 It appears to have another Greek derivative, morf- (H), which also lacks a plausible Indo-European origin.159 The stem is believed to have a basic meaning of “shape.” Such an interpretation, however, contains serious anomalies. Morfhv only occurs twice in Homer, where it is usually translated as “beautiful, graceful.” In both cases, however, it was used to describe the power of eloquence to move others with a sense of verbal conjuring.160 In later writings where it is used to signify “form,” the word frequently
refers to the shape of dreams fantasies. Morphe\vseems to have been the origin of Ovid’s Morpheus, the son of sleep and the bringer of dreams.161
Morphe\valso means “gesticulation.” The derived verb morphazo\is “to gesticulate” and has the nominal form morphásmos “dance in imitation of animals.” Thus the fundamental sense of morph is not “shape” but rather that of morphóomai “to take a form” morphoo\and metamorphoo\“to give shape and transform” in a magical way through dance and song. Greeks believed that Egyptian gods and men were skilled in magical transformations. In the Odyssey “the immortal Proteus of Egypt” was capable of taking any kind of shape.162 Osiris, under his later name as Serapis, was well known as a performer of miracles who could change his form as well as carrying out the related role as healer.163 Isis’ associa



[CH. 18] RELIGIOUS TERMINOLOGY 451
tion with magical change and healing was even stronger. The classic instance of this was in Apuleius’ Metamorphoses, in which the hero Lucius was transformed from being a donkey back to his human shape through Isiaic ritual and the goddess’s love and power.164 In the Contendings of Horus and Seth, 150 years earlier, Isis had transformed herself into an old woman, a maid, a bird (specifically, a kite) and a headless statue.165 Similar transformations are described of Demeter in the Homeric hymn dedicated to her.166 Diodoros quoted Egyptians who told him that Isis had discovered many drugs and had resurrected her dead son Horus and made him immortal.167 This idea about Isis clearly came from a very ancient tradition. In the Pyramid Texts, inscribed 2500 years earlier, Isis and her sister double Nephthys arrived “with healing on their wings” to heal and resuscitate Osiris.168 Thus, there is no doubt that Isis’ association with healing and revivifying far antedated any possible Greek influence.169 To sum up: Melampus, mo/elp, Merops and morph- all seem to derive from the West Semitic mrp> “shaman, ritual healer.” Despite the Semitic etymology, however, all, with the possible exception of Merops, have Egyptian associations and are linked in some way to Isis/Demeter and Osiris/Dionysos. Eumolpos and Melampus were specifically tied to the introduction and identification of Greek and Egyptian cults. Even though they claimed, and in many respects actually were inhibited by, religious scruples, Eumolpos and Melampus are able to provide specific proofs of the connection. Furthermore, increasing knowledge of Egyptian religion during the nineteenth century, especially the translation of various recensions of the Book of Coming Forth by Day (also called the Book of the Dead) showed striking similarities between the two systems.170 Thus, it is not surprising that the names Eumolpos and Eumolpid should have a plausible Afroasiatic origin. The other lesser priesthood at Eleusis was that of the Khvruke" or Khruvkidai. The name is obviously linked to kh'rux khruvko" “herald,” the origin of which from the Egyptian qÅ hr°w “high, loud of voice” was discussed in Chapter 17 as “one who announces the rituals or sacrifices.”171
CONCLUSION
The relationship between the Greek mysteries and Egypt are particularly close. The etymologies claimed in this chapter, however, indicate



452 BLACK ATHENA
an intimate connection between Greek religion and those of Afroasiatic speakers. This claim will be strengthened by the study of proper nouns in the next chapter. As with other semantic realms we have considered, the Egyptian component is larger than the Semitic. Because of the great reputation of Egyptian religion in the ancient world, I had anticipated that the disproportion would be far greater. The evidence confirms what the great scholar Victor Bérard argued in his study of Arkadia at the end of the nineteenth century: despite the preponderance of Egyptian influence on Greece during the Late Bronze Age, Semitic influence on Greek religion was also significant in or before that period.172

CHAPTER 19
DIVINE NAMES
Gods, Mythical Creatures, Heroes
INTRODUCTION: GODS
The names of nearly all the gods came from Egypt. I know from the enquiries I have made, that they came from abroad and it is most likely that they came from Egypt, For the names of all the gods have been known in Egypt since the beginning of time.1
The sea made it natural for Greeks to turn to neighbouring maritime peoples rather than to the hill-dwellers who lived on the European mainland. Egypt and Asia Minor were more interesting than Macedonia and Illyria. From these already ancient cultures the early Greeks learned many things: the names of exotic gods and goddesses such as Hera and Athena, who became fully naturalized . . .2
T
he two quotations above demonstrate that the general claims made in this chapter are neither new nor entirely out of fashion. Furthermore, Herodotos and other ancient writers paired Egyptian with Greek deities: Ammon with Zeus, Neith with Athena, Ptah with Hephaistos and so on. The second passage illustrates that some modern scholars still entertain such general views. What is new in this project are descriptions of the modes by which specific Greek divine names derived from Egyptian prototypes.



454 BLACK ATHENA
In Chapter 5, I argued that the inordinate number of prothetic vowels in Greek can be explained as the result of massive borrowings from Afroasiatic: either from words beginning with >aleph, ‘ayin, he and h≥et or from the prothetic vowels used, but not always written, in Egyptian.3 The proportion of the names of Greek gods and heroes beginning with alpha is significantly higher than it is for words in the vocabulary as a whole. Among the gods one finds Apollo, Aphrodite, Ares, Artemis, and Askle–pios, for example. All of these—with the exception of Ares—have strong Egyptian etymologies and very implausible Indo-European ones. Furthermore, these are not the only Greek divine names of Afroasiatic origin. I believe that I can show that Hephaistos, Enualios and Zeus all have reasonable-to-good Egyptian etyma.
H°PR “BECOME” H°PRR, APOLLO, ASKLE–PIOS, PYTHON AND DELPHI
Chapter 21 will focus on Hermes and Chapter 22 on Athena. This one begins with Apollo as its central figure as well as with names associated with him; notably those of his avatar Asklepios, as well as Apollo’s city Delphi his sea mammal delphis, his sacred plant daphne\and his birthplace Delos. The rest of this chapter will list the names of gods already treated and consider some others that have not so far been discussed.
APOLLO THE “ARYAN”
From at least the fifth century BCE until the early nineteenth CE Apollo was universally assumed to be the young god of the sun. Karl Ottfried Müller challenged this image with his view that Apollo was the dynamic “golden-haired” tribal god of the northern Dorians. He claimed that the earliest Greek texts did not refer to the god’s solar aspects.4 Its arguments—and those of his successors—against the long-standing tradition of Apollo as a sun god were and remain impressive. Apollo is an important divinity in the works of Hesiod and Homer but he is known as an archer, bringer of disease, a healer and the leader of the muses. Nowhere in these works is he explicitly equated with Helios, the divinized phenomenon of the “sun.” Helios and Eos “dawn” appear frequently in the epics without any reference to Apollo. In the mid-nineteenth century K. O. Müller’s view was submerged by what L. R. Farnell called “the foolish extravagances of the solar myth



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 455
theory” championed by Max Müller.5 The debate between the two interpretations has swung back and forth since then with various attempts at compromise.6 Nevertheless, while the popular view of Apollo as a sun god survives, most scholars generally side with Karl Ottfried Müller on this issue even while deprecating his extreme Aryanism.7 In the nineteenth century there was no doubt that Apollo originated from the north. This theory was largely based on the traditions of Hyperborean men and women associated with the god’s cult at both Delphi and Delos. Hyperborean was generally taken to mean “beyond the north wind.”8 In the early twentieth century by G. F. Hudson demolished the northern connection strongly indicating that the Greek traditions about the Hyperboreans pointed to China via Central Asia. Incidentally, the traveler Aristeas of Prokonessos, who appears to have reached the modern Xinjiang in the seventh or sixth century BCE, claimed to have been inspired by Apollo.9 Hudson’s hypothesis has been confirmed by archaeological discoveries of Chinese silk in tenth century BCE Egypt and sixth century Germany.10 Thus in the late twentieth century CE, while Apollo was still seen as “the most Greek of gods,” scholars were open to the idea of eastern connections, most preferred Asia Minor.11 There are, indeed, a number of possible Anatolian forms: a Lydian name Pldans Artimuk (for Artemis); the Hittite form ap-pa-li-u-na-s ̈is probably a divine name and the name Apulunas appears in hieroglyphic Hittite of the First Millennium.12 Walter Burkert denies the validity of all of these.13 He writes, however, that “there remain remarkable and probably ancient connections between Delos and Lycia, and there is also a series of Apollo oracles running along the coast of Asia Minor. . . .”14 Given my view of an Egyptian origin for the name, I see no objection to any or all of these parallel forms. There is no reason why coastal Anatolian cultures should have been any less influenced by Egyptian and Phoenician culture than those of the Aegean. The nineteenth-century explanation for the name Apollo rendered Ajpevllwn in Dorian from a Dorian word, ajpevllai (1), meaning “sacred assembly.” Unimpressed, the lexicographers Frisk and Chantraine declare that the etymology of Apollo is “unknown.” The historian of Greek religion D.C. Dietrich is equally skeptical.15 Burkert, however, still maintains the hypothesis. He argues that these assemblies were used for the initiation of youths into manhood and full membership of the community. He points specifically to Apollo’s epithet ajkersimeno" “unshorn locks” (suitable for a boy before initiation) found in the Iliad.16 The power



456 BLACK ATHENA
of this evidence is weakened by the fact that all serious derivations of Apollo and his cult insist on the god’s youth. Frisk and Chantraine (more cautiously) derive Apellai itself from a hypothetical Indo-European *n-`pel-ia÷=“in drive.” An alternative to this is from the Egyptian ˆp in the sense “to muster, assemble people” with the post position -r.17 This would make apellai yet another of the Laconian terms drawn from Late Egyptian.18Neither etymology explains the double -ll, and it is possible that this was the result of association either with Apollo or the proposed Egyptian etymon H°prr.
WAS APOLLO A SUN GOD BEFORE THE FIFTH CENTURY?
Part 1: Evidence from the Greek epics
The scholarly consensus still maintains that the solar aspect of the Apollonian cult only developed in the fifth century.19 The absence of the name Apollo from the Linear B apparently reinforces this idea. As mentioned above, however, the name Payawo, Paie–o–n a healing deity that later merged with Apollo, does appear in that corpus. The derivation of Paie–o–n from *pÅ ˆwn as a biname of Horus was suggested in Chapter 9.20 In the Iliad Paie–o–n cured the injured.21 Both the high reputation of Egyptian medicine and Paie–o–n as a healing god are reflected in a passage from the Odyssey quoted in Chapter 7; it states that the Egyptians were all physicians, were “wise above mankind” and were the “race of Paie–o–n.”22 This is closely parallel, and almost certainly a calque from s=ms(w) H≥r, “followers of Horus,” the primeval kings of Egypt and, in the singular, a “righteous person.”23 A similar parallel of Apollo and Paie–o–n with each other and life-saving medicine appears in a fragment from Hesiod.24 Horus, too, had his healing aspect.25 It is not controversial to find early traces of the merger of the cult of Paie–o–n into that of Apollo. What has been debated since the nineteenth century is whether Apollo was originally seen as a sun god. I believe from Egyptian parallels that this was undoubtedly the case. Before examining this material, however, I should like to consider evidence from within the Greek tradition. First, there is the ancient and widespread cult of Apollo Luvkeio"; Homer appears to have interpreted this epithet as “coming from Lycia” (in Anatolia). In the Iliad, Lycian heroes swear by Apollo lukhgenhv".26



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 457
The term has a wonderful ambiguity. It could mean “born in Lycia”; “wolf-born” from luvko" “wolf ” with its impeccable Indo-European etymology; or “light born” or “light begetting” from the ancient Greek morpheme luk- from an Indo-Hittite, if not Nostratic, root.27 An enlarged form luvkh is found in the compound ajmfiluvkh, meaning the “light before the dawn.” Also, luke–gene–s could be derived from any two, or all three, of these sources.28 Apollo fought on the Trojan side at the siege of Troy, and Homer no doubt believed that the cult of Apollo was strong, if not central, in western Anatolia. As well as references to such a cult in Lycia, there was another in Mysia and the Troad.29 Farnell considered the possibility that there was a cult of Apollo Luvkeio" “the wolf,” in Lycia but he had doubts about it.30 Elsewhere, he found references to statues of wolves associated with Apollo Luvkeio" but was unable to find clear evidence of any wider wolf cult in Greece. He concluded that the statues were traces of an extremely ancient, primitive and largely abandoned religious practice.31 In Hellenistic times the third alternative was preferred and Luvkeio" was explained as deriving from luvkh “light.”32 In this case the representations of wolves could be explained as the result of a folk etymology as well as the fact that it is easier to carve or cast a statue of a wolf than one of light or dawn. As the cult of Apollo Luvkeio" is extremely ancient and was referred to by Homer, it provides one indication that Apollo may have been associated with “light” and more precisely with “dawn,” well before the fifth century.33 Another word based on the polysemic root *luvk is lukavba" (H). In the two attestations of the word in the Odyssey it is followed by promises of Odysseus’ homecoming: “as the old moon wanes and the new one appears.”34 In later Greek, however, it meant “year.” Modern scholars have given its original—or Homeric—meaning many interpretations. It has been linked to * luvk as “wolf ” and Lycian.35 These are less likely than the proposal that lukabas derives from luvk-+ bainw, the “going of light” or the dark night of the first new moon.36 It should be remembered, however, that baino\can mean “come” as well as go, hence it could mean “dawn.” Whatever the precise meaning, the form clearly means a period of time, possibly the completion of a cycle. Szemerényi derives it from a Semitic term found in the Ugaritic nqpt “a cycle of feasts.”37 Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and Gilbert Murray argued that Odysseus’ return to Ithaca was on the point 19 years (after he set out from Troy)



458 BLACK ATHENA
when the solar year and lunar month come together. This measurement is called the Metonic cycle after Meto–n of Athens, who in 432 BCE was the first to set it out. Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and Murray plausibly maintained that these passages from the Odyssey indicate that the cycle was known centuries earlier, at the time when they believed the epic was composed or redacted.38 Norman Austin appears to have been following this theory, when in his study of Odysseus’ homecoming he wrote: “Whether lukabas be year or month, however, makes little difference in the circumstances for the year has practically run its course: ‘this year’ and ‘this month’ are at this point in the poem, synonymous.”39 Austin makes a powerful case for the hero’s arrival in Ithaca in or after winter.40 The key date for Odysseus’ return is the feast of Apollo, which the scholiast states was that of Apollo Noumhnivo" “of the new moon.” If Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Murray and Austin are right this new moon was special and ushered in the new year. The feast of Apollo, the archer god, was appropriate for Odysseus’ bloody display. There is annual or solar symbolism, however, in the hero’s earlier shooting through or threading twelve axs.41 Arguing against this symbolism is the thesis put forward by Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, and accepted by Nilsson, arguing for an eastern origin for Apollo. They pointed out that, unlike the other gods who generally were celebrated at the full moon, his feast day was on the seventh day of the lunar month. They saw this day as a strict parallel to the Babylonian Sabattu, the seventh day of the month set aside for expiations and purifications.42 In any event, the *luk stem clearly indicates that from Homeric or pre-Homeric times, Apollo was associated with the calendar and heavenly lights, the sun and the moon.43 Farnell and Bethe opposed this idea advanced by Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and Nilsson.
STEALING THE CATTLE OF THE SUN. In the Odyssey Odysseus’ crew, though not Odysseus himself, steal and eat Helios’ cattle.44 In many ways Odysseus—“the traveler”—can be seen as his legendary greatgrandfather Hermes.45 Even earlier Hesiod referred to the same story with the cattle belonging to Apollo rather than to Helios. In The Great Eoiae, which is often attributed to Hesiod, the poet wrote “then Hermes made designs on Apollo’s herd of cattle.”46 This version was set out in more detail in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes in which Hermes, born at dawn, dashes through the day always one step ahead of Apollo, hiding from and tricking his elder brother. Hermes’ most egregious act was to



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 459
steal fifty of Apollo’s cattle. Farnell saw in this a threat to his denial of Apollo’s early solar aspects. He wrote, “Apollo loses his oxen as Helios does, though the circumstances are different; the stealing of divine cattle may sometimes be a solar story, but need not always be.”47 As well as neglecting the passage from Hesiod, Farnell drastically underestimated the parallels between the story in the Odyssey and that in the Hymn. I believe that one can take the relationship a stage further and see that already at least by Homer’s time, Hermes and his greatgrandson Odysseus were identified with the planet Mercury.48 Mercury’s course is the most extreme ellipse and it travels farthest of all the planets beyond the ecliptic, passing from the living sky with the moving planets and the Zodiac to the “dead sky” around the pole. Similarly, HermesOdysseus is the trickster figure who passes between and connects the worlds of the living and the dead. The Latin Mercurius is the “trader.”49 Odysseus’ descent into Hades and the ascent into Skheria with its remarkable resemblances to the stellar Field of Rushes of the Egyptian Sht°iÅrw are discussed in Chapter 10.50 Hermes as the planet Mercury was Hermes Psychopompos, the guide for dead souls, the communicator between realms and the counterpart of the Egyptian Anubis.51 The idea that Venus and Mercury move around the sun has been attributed to Heraklides of Pontos in the fourth century BCE, although G.E.R. Lloyd is skeptical.52 On the other hand, the Hymn to Hermes strongly suggests that this attribution was known to Greeks by the seventh or sixth centuries. Mesopotamians had much earlier an extraordinarily sophisticated understanding of Mercury’s relationship to the sun.53 Further evidence of the planetary basis of the Homeric Hymn comes in lines 76–8, and 210–26 when Hermes turns the hooves of cattle back to front so that they and their tracks appear to be going backwards. This is clearly pointing to the well-known planetary “retrogradations.” G.E.R. Lloyd describes these: “From time to time the position of a planet in relation to the fixed stars appears to remain the same for a number of days; the planet then appears to move back, from east to west, through the constellations for a time; and then after a second stationary period it resumes its usual easterly movement. . . .”54 The mythology brought out in the Hymn is complicated or enriched by another association, that of Hermes with the moon. He was given lordship over “boars with gleaming [ajrgivodousi] tusks.”55 In this capacity he was the counterpart of the Egyptian god Thoth. The Hymn, however, focuses on the whizzing planet. Thus, not only does it strengthen



460 BLACK ATHENA
the three-way identification of Hermes with the planet Mercury but also the conjunction of these lines in the Odyssey with the Hymn confirms that, at least for the later text, there were close parallels between Helios and Apollo.
Part 2: Evidence from Egyptian parallels
APOLLO AND HORUS. Herodotos stated explicitly “the Greeks call Horus son of Osiris, Apollo.”56 The identification is implicit throughout his work. The question is how far back can this identification be traced? The most frequent epithet for Apollo was Phoibos, the origin of which was discussed in Chapter 9.57 Although this term indicates “brightness,” it has no specifically solar implications. The next most common epithets are eJkavergo" and eJkhbovlo" or eJkathbovlo" “far-worker, far-shooter.” This is interesting because the generally accepted origin of the name H≥rw, is from h≥r “distant.”58 In Egyptian theology Horus was the falcon high in the sky swooping down on his victims. In the Iliad Zeus orders his son to encourage Hector: “Nor was Apollo disobedient to his father’s bidding, but he went down from the hills of Ida like a swift falcon [i[rhki ejoikw;~] the slayer of doves, that is the swiftest of winged things.”59 In the Odyssey one finds the description “a hawk, the swift messenger of Apollo.”60 The epithet eJkavergo" was frequently preceded by a[nax, so too was Dio;" ui;o" “son of Zeus” and sometimes Anax was used alone.61 In Chapter 10 I argued that anax–anaktos derived from Œnh dt “may he live forever.”62 This was the normal formula placed after the names of living pharaohs. Horus has been identified with the living pharaoh since the Fourth Millennium.63 Pharaohs had many names but the first, and in ancient times the primary one, was the Horus name which, as Gardiner put it, “represents the king as the earthly embodiment of the old falcongod Horus, who early became the dynastic god of Egypt and as such was identified with the sun god Re–œ himself . . . . On the whole we may conclude that the Horus name denotes the aspect of Horus worn by the king whilst dwelling in the palace [not the tomb].”64
TROIZEN, OROS AND APOLLO. Troizen was set across the Saronic Gulf from Athens. The city claimed unparalleled antiquity and Pausanias speculated that it may have been founded by an Egyptian and that [Wro" “looks like an Egyptian not a Greek name.”65 Pausanias reported:



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 461
The Sanctuary of Apollo Thearia was built they said by Pittheus Pitqevu" and it is the oldest sanctuary I know. The temple of Athena at Phokeia in Ionia, which was burned by Harpagus the Mede, is undoubtedly ancient and so is the temple of the Pythian Apollo at Samos; but both were built long after the sanctuary at Troizen.66
Pausanias’ hypotheses that Troizen was both extremely ancient and had Egyptian connections are supported by evidence from both names and archaeology. The name Oros immediately suggested to Pausanias, as it does to us, the Egyptian god Horus, which is written Oros in Greek. This temple leads us to the critical link between Horus and Apollo: they were both dragon slayers. Horus killed his uncle and his father’s murderer Seth who was in the form of a water monster. Apollo killed the Python. It is interesting to note, that a church for the Christian dragon slayer St. George was built on what seems to have been the same spot.67 Apollo and Python will be discussed later in this chapter.
THE SUN, THE MOON AND THE EYE. Earlier in this chapter, I showed that through the root *luk Apollo could be associated with both the sun and the moon. Horus too was associated with both the sun and the moon, his “two eyes.”68 The complications of the cults and myths of the two hawk eyes are immense, but central to all is the sense that one had been injured by Seth but cured by Thoth. The associations are largely, but not exclusively, with the waxing and waning of the moon.69 Despite the direct links with Thoth, there are some with Horus himself. Just as Hermes was given the “gleaming boars tusks [ajrgivodousi],” Apollo had an ajrgrevio" bio" or ajrgurovtoxon “silver bow.”70 According to Apollonios of Rhodes, Apollo also had a “golden bow” (solar) which blazed through the darkness and appears to be linked to the epithet aijglhvth" “gleaming.”71 Apollo’s arrows play a very important role in the epics and there areas far as I am aware—no references to Horus as an archer. He was, however, famous for his harpooning.72 Thus, Apollo’s use of the bow and arrow can be explained as modification of the Egyptian tradition by Greeks for whom harpoons were not important and which fit well with the epithets “far-worker” and “far-shooter.” Despite these possible lunar associations, Horus was fundamentally associated with the sun. Thus, the substantial evidence of early parallels between Horus and Apollo traced above make it clear that among



462 BLACK ATHENA
his other aspects, Apollo was seen as a sun god long before the fifth century
BCE.
H°prr, Ajpovllwn. Since the Pyramid Text, a particular form of Horus was associated specifically with the morning sun: H≥r Åh≥ty “Horus of the
horizon” written with the sign Z (N27) doubled. H≥r Åh≥ty was seen as the equivalent of Re@Œ.73 This and another form—H≥r m Åh≥t, transcribed in Greek as {Armaci", was Horus of the rising sun—were seen as equivalents of H°prr.”74 For most of their history Ancient Egyptians worshipped different aspects of the sun. The sun as a whole was Re–Œ (Ra), its disk was Itn (Aten), in the evening it was Itm (Atum) and in the morning H°prr (Khopri). From the time of the Pyramid Text all of these aspects had been closely identified with each other.75 Etymologically, H°prr is derived from h°pr “become, come into being” and is related to h°pry “children.” These and other members of the cluster are written with the determinative and
triliteral of the scarab 8 (L1) h°pr (the beetle rolling the dung ball symbol
izing the sun, up the heap) symbol of health and rebirth. H°prr, then, was the young god of the sun at dawn and of medicine and rebirth. Apollo as the youthful divinity of the sun and one concerned with medicine provides a neat semantic fit with H°prr. Phonetically, the two have the attractive feature of the double liquid in both H°prr and Apollo. The problem is that /h°/ was very seldom transcribed into Greek as /ø/. Such a borrowing would, however, be possible if the introduction were late and had come through Phoenician in which /h°/ had merged with /h≥/, which was frequently rendered /ø/ in Greek. A borrowing from Phoenician after the Canaanite shift is indicated by the vocalization of Ajpovllwn as (C)aCoCCo–. Relative lateness is also suggested by the fact that the name Apollo, as opposed to that of his counterpart Paihvwn, has not so far been attested in Linear B. The Egyptian etymology of Paie–o–n was set out in Chapter 9.76 H°pr and scarab. Two forms of h°pr survived in Coptic, s=pe\re from h°prt “event, happening” and s=o\pe “to be, exist, become.” In the latter case, the long /o–/ suggests that there had been metathesis of the accepted type, transfer of liquid in third to second position, that is from h°pr to *h°rp. Stronger evidence that this change took place comes from beyond Egyptian. First, there is the Greek doublet khrafiv", ka–vrabo" (4) “lobster, crab, horned scarab.”77 In Chapter 8, I listed the ways by which the Hebrew /s=/ was transcribed into Greek: /cq/, /khth/, /sc/, /skh/,



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 463
/sk/, /sk/ or /x/, /ks/, and finally as simple /s/, /s/. Similar confusion undoubtedly held for the Egyptian and Coptic /s=/ particularly during the shift from /h°/. Ernout and Meillet derive the Latin scarabaeus “scarab” from karabos by postulating an earlier *scarafaius. This is unnecessary if they are seen as earlier and later borrowings from Egyptian *h°rp and *s ̈rp. Scarab amulets, providing protection for health and rebirth, are found not only in Egypt but throughout the Mediterranean and the Roman Empire beyond. Thus, there is every reason to suppose that scarabaeus took its name from a form of h°pr the Egyptian word for “scarab.” The name of the god *Asklhpiov" has many variants: jAsklapiov", Aijsklapiov", Aijsclapiov", Aijsclabiov", etc.78 Such variety suggests a loan. Chantraine concludes that the etymology is “unknown, but a borrowing would not be surprising.” Askle\pios as a god of medicine was sometimes seen as the counterpart of the divinized early Egyptian polymath and doctor Imhotep.79 Michael Astour has written a detailed study showing the further links between the mythical figures jAskavlafo" “owl” and jAskavlabo" “lizard or lizard-headed snake.” Their names are clearly variants of Askle–pios. Both creatures were symbolically associated with medicine and death. The owl was the sacred bird of Kos (kôs is Hebrew for night owl), the island center of Greek medicine.80 Askle–pios also closely paralleled Apollo through their common association with healing. Astour puts the lack of an Indo-European derivation more strongly than Chantraine: “the name Askle–pios absolutely does not surrender to even the remotest Greek etymology.” He suggests that the name derives from the Akkadian es ̈s ̈epu, the title of a healing exorcist priest and the word for “owl.”81 No doubt, Ancient Greek medicine contained important Mesopotamian influences, including the now worldwide medical symbol of a snake wrapped round a staff.82 Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that the most extensive outside influence on Greek medicine came from Egypt.83 Thus, it would seem reasonable to consider an Egyptian loan. The obvious candidate is the reconstructed derivation from h°pr, *s=rp. Among the correspondences listed above, /s=/ could be rendered as /sk/ as with scarabaeus or /skh/. A reduction of the first vowel, would have left a complex *skrVp or *skhrVp, which would have necessitated a prothetic /ˆ/, giving /a/ or /ai/—an alternation found in the Greek variants. The etymological relationship between Apollo from h°prr and



464 BLACK ATHENA
Askle–pios from *s=rp is matched by the mythological connection. Apollo as a healer, with the epiclesis Maleavta" (6), was closely associated with Askle\pios. Farnell dismisses the hypothesis that Maleatas derives from the place name Malea and insists that its use was associated with sickness and healing and that it was always adjectival. This idea weakens the notion that Maleatas was once an independent deity.84 The most plausible etymology is the Egyptian mrt “disease.” All myths make Apollo the father of Askle–pios.85
TWINS, APOLLO AND ARTEMIS
I shall argue below that Delphi, like ajdelfov" “brother,” came from Semitic roots meaning “couple, twin.” Thus Apollo’s title Delfivnio", common in Crete and elsewhere is a doublet of his epiclesis Divdumo" “pair, twin.” The city and the oracle got their name from “twinness.” Apollo’s twin was Artemis. In Hellenistic and Roman times ArtemisDiana, was seen as the huntress goddess of the moon. Her Egyptian equivalent in this respect was the goddess BÅst whose most important cult center was Pr BÅst, Bubastis—discussed above in Chapter 9.86 BÅst was often represented as a cat and, in this aspect, she was identified with the moon. She also had a fiery aspect, however, and in Memphis was worshipped as a lion goddess so fearful that she was known by the euphemism Sh°mt “mighty.” Tmt seems a reasonable candidate for the occluded name. As in Ptolemaic Denderah, BÅst was known as the female counterpart of Tm and at Heliopolis BÅst was known as “daughter of Atum.”87 As such, she was seen as helping Horus destroy his enemies. In this capacity she was seen as a lioness and identified as the female counterpart of Ra and ˆtm, Atum or Tm, god of the evening sun. The nineteenth-century dismissal of Apollo as a sun god was paralleled by a skepticism about Artemis as a goddess of the moon or sunset. Apart from the value of the “later” testimony to that effect and the Egyptian evidence, more support is provided by some of the goddess’ epithets. Many references to cultic names are associated with the moon. A fragment from Aiskhylos reads, “whom neither the ray of the sun beholds, nor the starry eye of Leto’s daughter [Artemis].”88 Given the general acknowledgment of the dramatist’s use of early sources, the lines cannot be dismissed as “late.” She was known as Selasfovro" “moon bearer” at Phlya in Attika.89 With more ambiguity between sun and moon



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 465
she was also known as Fwsfovro" “light bearer.”90 Other epicleses indicate heat as well as light. Artemis Purwniva “fiery” provided sacred fire for the Lernian festival.91 On the Euripos she was known as Aijqopiva, “burning face.” At least from the fifth century she was represented as holding a torch.92 Like Apollo, Artemis was given the title Lukeia at Troizen.93 In the Theogony, Hesiod calls her ijocevairan. This remains the goddess’s most common epithet in Hesiod and Homer. Since ancient times iokheairan has been understood as “delighting in arrows.” The semantics are excellent for a huntress goddess and ijo" is undoubtedly “arrow.” There is, however, uncertainty about the length of the initial i- in iokheairan. Furthermore, the second element -kheairan is disputed and unclear. In Egyptian ˆ∆∆w was “twilight” sometimes written ˆw∆∆w and in late times it is attested as Å∆Å∆. ˆ∆∆w was also the name of some divine
beings, written with » (G7) or f (N8). In the latter case there was a
variant ˆÅ∆∆w.94 The phonetic range, certainly with metathesis of liquid in second and third position, allows for an etymon of iokheairan. Though far from perfect, this etymology as a goddess of twilight certainly equals the Indo-European iokheairan. Other epithets include khrysos “gold,” which is frequent with many divinities. One interesting compound form, which is more specific, is crusovqrono" “golden throne.” It is applied to Artemis once in the Iliad and once in the Odyssey.95 It is also applied to Hera at sunset and twice to hwv" dawn.96 This raises the possibility that the epithet was inspired by the skies at sunrise and sunset. Returning to Tm as the god of the evening, his female partner Tmt appears in a late inscription as a counterpart to BÅst but she seems to have had some independence as early as the Pyramid Texts. In the midThird Millennium she seems to have been linked to Rwty, the two lion gods of the sun, who are associated with H≥r Åh≥ty.97 The latter’s greatest monument was the Sphinx at Giza.98 Egyptologists agree that Sfivgx derives from s=spw Œnh°“living image.”99 S+spw has a sphinx as its determinative. A text inscribed on the creature’s chest at the command of the late fifteenth-century pharaoh Tuthmosis IV refers to H≥r Åh≥ty and H≥r(y) Tm, which almost certainly refers to Tm himself.100 A feminine form *H≥rt Tm(t), constructed on the analogy of the attested h≥rt tp “chieftainess,” provides a good etymon for Artemis. The initial a- indicates an early loan before the Canaanite shift. Many examples of the Egyptian h≥- being reduced to ø- in Greek can be found.



466 BLACK ATHENA
The early association between Tmt and the double lion fits with Artemis’ association with lions but it does not explain why the Greeks should have preferred *H≥rt Tm(t) to *H≥ry Tm himself. At this point we turn to a legendary and mythical cycle—that of Thebes fifty miles to the east of Delphi. Here, cosmic myths came together with the legendary Kadmean conquest and settlement. I am concerned with the myths. Kadmos shared many features with Apollo. Like the rising sun, he came from the east. Qdm itself means “east” in most Semitic languages. Like Apollo (see below) Kadmos slew a dragon guarding a spring and founded a city. The young sun god himself was present at Thebes where in classical times he was worshipped as Apollo of the Ashes or Apollo jIsmhvnio" from the river jIsmhnov". This name derived from the Semitic root ÷s ̈mn “fat or fertile” and the divine name Es ̈mun, god of healing associated with serpents.101 An alternative name for the river was Lavdwn, which was also the name of a snake or dragon killed by another divine hero connected to Thebes—Herakles.102 Herakles was also associated with lions and the sun.103 Like Apollo, Kadmos had a sister to whom he was closely attached. Many scholars have derived her name, Europa, from the Semitic Œrb “west or evening.”104 Europa was often depicted as veiled and associated with blackness. In this she resembled Lhtw,v the mother of Apollo and Artemis. The name Leto is clearly derived from the Semitic ÷lt`“sheath veil” discussed in an earlier chapter.105 It is also similar to early pronunciations of RŒt, the feminine counterpart of Re–Œ whose association with Rhea will be discussed below. Clearly, the /r/ in Re–Œ corresponds to /l/ in other Afroasiatic languages.106 In general both RŒt and Leto appear to have been associated with the night sky. Astour argues plausibly that Leto’s daughter Artemis symbolized not only the darkness of evening but also the bodies that shine in it—the evening sun and the evening star.107 He also suggests that the name Telephassa for the mother of Kadmos and Europa may not merely mean “far shining” but may also be related to the Akkadian name for the planet Venus, Dil Bad—transcribed by Hesykhios as Delephat. In Babylonian astrology Venus the morning star was thought of as male, while Venus in the evening was female.108 Thus Kadmos’ fruitless search for his sister can be seen in cosmic terms as the impossible pursuit of the morning for the evening star. In Egypt the conception of the morning as male and the evening as female was a minor tradition. Among Semitic speakers,



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 467
however, it was dominant, which would explain its presence in Greece given the other Semitic associations of these myths. The Greek tendency in this direction was probably further strengthened by the Hurrian and north Syrian view of a female sun. As in the Egyptian tradition, from which the legend may well have been derived, the Hurrian goddess H°pt was seen as a double-headed lion. H°pt was mentioned in Volume 2 as the etymon of the names Hipta, found in the Orphic hymns, and He–be, Herakles’s wife.109 The Semitic tradition of the sun as female, Íps,= can be seen in the ancient Greek mountain name Sapyselaton, which Astour plausibly explains as deriving from an Ugaritic *Íps=ilt, the “goddess Íaps ̈u.110 Like Apollo (discussed below), Kadmos killed the snake. Even so, both Thebes and Delphi continued to be harried by monsters in female form. In Delphi the monsters were either snake- or lion-like creatures. In Thebes one creature had many facets: the Sphinx with the head of a woman, the body of a lion and eagle-like wings. Before considering the Theban Sphinx, we should look at the Delphic Python.
Python
A central myth of Apollo was set at Delphi, where the young god, accompanied by his twin sister Artemis, killed a serpent, Python and founded the city that became famous for its oracle. Apollo ruled it but Delphi continued to be troubled by a female monster or monsters who were in someway connected to the Python.111 Pu–qwvwas thought to be the ancient name of Delphi. Puqwvn was the snake or dragon who guarded it and was killed by Apollo. Apollo took on the titles of Puvqio" and Puqai'o" and other titles. Chantraine describes the form as a “toponym without an etymology.” On the grounds of the long /u–/ in Pu–tho–, he follows Strabo in doubting the ancient belief that it was linked to punqavnomai to “inform oneself, interrogate” often used of oracles.112 There is a possible Egyptian alternative. In Chapter 9, I discussed the derivation of potamos from the toponym Pr Tm.113 In that chapter, I listed a number of variations in the Coptic and Greek rendering of pr: pr-, pl-, pa-, phar-, pi-, pou-, and bou. Others exist for pe and pe–but not, as far as I am aware, for *pu–. As the date at which Greek fronted the /u/ to become /ü/ or /y/ is uncertain, the distinction between pou- and *pu–- is not absolute. Therefore, a relatively good parallel to the proposal that



468 BLACK ATHENA
the Hebrew Pîto–m, could be matched by a Greek Pu–qwvn can be found in the case of Pr BÅstt being rendered Pî beset in the Bible and Boubastis in Greek.114 The name Pr Tm derives from the temple and cult of Atum discussed in Chapter 9 as a possible origin for Potamos.115 The nineteenth-century Egyptologist Eduard Naville maintained that Pr Tm was to be found at the site of Tel el Maskhutah.116 In his excavations there he discovered “late” inscriptions referring to worship of Atum in the form of a holy serpent, a manifestation of which was kept in a satellite shrine—Pr Qrh≥t “house of the serpent spirit.”117 This archaeological evidence of a relationship between Atum and a serpent at Pr Tm only goes back the Saite Dynasty in the late seventh century BCE. The identification of Atum with serpents, however, is older and dates back at least to the beginning of the New Kingdom. In the Book of Coming Forth by Day, Atum declares that with the destruction of the earth he will turn himself into a serpent.118 In Black Athena Writes Back I quoted the Swiss Egyptologist Eric Hornung: “Atum is the god ‘who in the beginning was everything,’ complete in the sense of being an undifferentiated unity and at the same time nonexistent because existence is impossible before his work of creation.”119 Further on in his work on the “Ouroboros,” the snake with his tail in his mouth, an image which was popular after the Amarna period, Hornung refers to the “primeval god who outlives the existent world and changes into a snake at the end of time . . . the complete circle of the snake’s body illustrates—so far as it is possible to depict it—the nonexistent which encompasses the world on all sides.”120 In these passages Hornung relates the Ouroboros to Apopis, the evil serpent who attacks the sun every day and is daily defeated by Ra and Horus. In the earlier passage, however, he makes it clear that Atum was also both “to be and not to be.”121 Thus, the snake could represent both evil and infinity. Deriving the Python from Pr Tm would indirectly explain the evil serpent who is defeated by the heroes of the sun in an almost worldwide myth.122 That Atum was beyond time does not necessarily mean that he had prophetic powers. Indeed, while we have records of oracles of other Egyptian divinities, Atum has none. Nevertheless, the Egyptian ambiguity between Apopis and Atum explains that at Delphi Python fought with Apollo and the prophetic Pythia who interpreted the oracle.



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 469
A Latin name for Pr Tm, Pithona Civitas—mentioned in Chapter 9—indicates at the very least that some people in antiquity saw a connection between Python and Pr Tm.123 Although this connection does not provide conclusive evidence, it strengthens the phonetic and semantic case for the identification.
If Pr Tm with its ophic cult is the origin of Pu–tho– and its Python, an uncomfortable association rises between Artemis, the helper of the young sun god against the enemy Apopis, and Atum, divinity of the waning sun and eternal serpent. Furthermore, the key figure in the Apolline cult at Delphi was the Puqiva, and Pythia was also an epithet of Artemis at the oracular cult of Apollo Didymos near Miletus.124 Pythia provides a link between the god’s helper and the female monster who continues to haunt the scene after the male serpent-dragon has been killed. According to the Homeric Hymn to the Pythian Apollo, the dragoness in the mountains behind Delphi carried wayfarers off to their doom.125 The hostile Lapivqai and Fleguai—the plausible Egyptian origins of these names were given in Chapter 9—appear to have represented local resistance to new settlers.126 Thus, they were more legendary than mythical. Other demons were depicted as animals, including the Suvbari" and the Lavmia ̈. The derivations of these names from the Egyptian *sbÅ “hyena, jackal” and the Semitic *labi> “lion, wildcat” were discussed in Chapter 15.127 Even if this connection between the wild Pythia and lions cannot be sustained, Fontenrose sees another link between her and the Theban Sphinx. He claimed that the Hymn to the Pythian Apollo describes a contest between the monster and her victims similar to the riddle the Sphinx asked all passersby.128 The Sphinx riddle is also similar to the riddling oracular statements of the Delphic Pythia.
The Sphinx
The distinction between the Babylonian and Canaanite conception of evening as female, on the one hand, and the predominant Egyptian picture of the same time as male, on the other, is paralleled by the iconography of sphinxes. Our image of sphinxes is essentially shaped by the Great Sphinx of Giza but this massive carving is very different from sphinxes of the Second Millennium. An example with wings exists from



470 BLACK ATHENA
the Old Kingdom, and from the turn of the Second Millennium this type became the norm not merely in Egypt but in Babylonia and Syria as well. The great increase in the number of sphinxes in the Hyksos period suggests that, like the similar griffin, the sphinx had become a symbol of the mobile and voracious invaders.129 Wallis Budge attributed the relative lack of references to sphinxes in Egyptian religious texts to a perceived connection between the mythical beast and hated foreigners.130 An association with the Hyksos could explain why the Giza monument had been neglected a long time (over a century?) before Tuthmosis IV restored it. Like the griffin the sphinx does not appear in Crete until the end of the ceramic period, Middle Minoan II, just before the Hyksos invasion proposed according the Revised Ancient Model. The sphinx became a popular motif in Middle Minoan Crete and Mycenaean Greece. Around the Aegean, as in the rest of the eastern Mediterranean, sphinxes were increasingly represented as female in the second half of the Second Millennium. This iconography fits neatly with the monster’s role in the Kadmean myth cycle. According to the mythographer Palaiphatos, the Theban Sphinx was Kadmos’ first wife. She was supposed to have run off to Fivkion, or the Sphinx Mountain, northwest of Thebes and to have harried the city from there. Other writers disagreed about her location. Euripides placed her in the Kadmeia, the royal palace.131 Interestingly, Sophokles put Artemis in the same spot, above the Agora. Pausanias described a temple to Artemis on the same site; in front stood a stone lion.132 According to Plutarch, altars to, and statues of, Artemis were in every marketplace in Boiotia and Lokris.133 Furthermore, large stone lions have been found at Thespiai and at Khaironeia, where they commemorated the Theban dead. Then at the precinct of Apollo, at his (and Artemis’) birthplace Delos, is a seventh-century avenue of lions.134 The lion was associated with the sun and, in Greece, with Apollo. Just as BÅst and Tmt were represented as the fierce lion-headed Sh°mt, Artemis was linked to the female sphinx. This idea is not surprising when one considers Artemis’ relationship with wild animals. She was a hunter but like Athena, with whom she was often confused, she was probably “the mistress of animals” depicted in Mesopotamian, Syrian and Aegean art. Theodore Gaster has made a plausible case linking her to the ferocious Canaanite goddess ŒAnat.135 The followers of the two, like the Bakkhai, were alleged to have been



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 471
involved in sparagmov", the tearing apart of live victims and eating them. As the chilling Ugaritic verse read:
She ate his flesh without a knife. She drank his blood without a cup.136
These characteristics, the names of Kadmos and Europa and the feminine gender of both the lion-monster and the evening indicate strong western Semitic influences on the Theban myth cycle. On the other hand, many Egyptian features also appear: the names Apollo, Artemis, and Sphinx and the relationship of solar deities with the lion. Furthermore, the riddle of the Theban Sphinx has clear parallels with that of the Great Sphinx of Giza:
What is it that has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and twofooted and three-footed?
To which Oidipous’ answer was
Man, for in infancy he crawls on all fours and in old age he supports his steps with a staff.137
Frazer saw the riddle as worldwide and, among other parallels, quoted one from what is now Zambia:
What is it that goes on four legs in the morning, on two at midday, and on three in the evening? answer a man. . . .138
It is interesting that Frazer, who also quoted a similar riddle from Mongolia, did not refer to the following example, a more relevant parallel in the Myth of Ra and Isis, in which Ra says:
I am H°prr in the morning, I am Re–Œ at noon and Tm in the evening.139
The waxing and waning applies as well to the strength of the sun over the day as to the life of man.140 Thus, despite the differences of gender and appearance the Egyptian and Greek sphinxes were undoubtedly closely connected. The mixture of Canaanite and Egyptian influences in the myths of the foundation of Thebes and of the Theban sphinx, fits well with many other aspects of Boiotian and Theban culture discussed elsewhere in these volumes.141



472 BLACK ATHENA
Delphi, womb, dolphin and others
A cluster of words central to the cult of Apollo derives from Afroasiatic, probably Semitic but possibly also Egyptian. It is the series listed by Chantraine under one heading: devlfax (5) “sow”; delfiv", delfi`no" (5) “dolphin”; Delfoiv (H) “Delphi,” city of Apollo and the oracle; and delfuv" (4) “womb.” Linked to the last is ajdelfov" (H) “brother.” Delfi", and Delfoivhave Aeolic variants bevlfin and bevlfoi. There were also the Boiotian forms bevlfo" and bevlfi". On these grounds, Chantraine and Frisk agree that Delfiv" derives from a labiovelar and they extend this conclusion to delfuv". Frisk mentions the Aeolic bevlfoi, although Chantraine uncharacteristically omits it. Neither make the obvious next step of proposing that the city name too comes from a labiovelar. One reason for accepting a labiovelar origin for delfuv" without a parallel *belfuv" is that there appear to be Indo-European cognates for the latter in the Avestan gErEbus#“young animal” and the Germanic kalb “calf.” These possible cognates would not of course explain the other words in the apparent cluster—especially Delphi. The city name has other interesting dialect variants: Dalfoivis relatively easy to explain either as the original form or, more likely given the general consistence of /e/ in all the other words, as a back formation. More interesting is the form Dolfoi,vwhich could be explained as a result of rounding a labiovelar. Given this and bevlfoi, it seems overwhelmingly likely that the city name and the whole cluster derive from a labiovelar form *gwElf. An equally intriguing verbal cluster is found in Afroasiatic, or at least in Semitic and Egyptian. In Ge'ez there is a form qwElf “bolt” and in Tigrinya and Amharic qwäläfä “lock.” In Arabic there was metathesis: qaffala “lock.” Tigre has the two forms qäffäla and qälläfa. The meaning “lock” could be extended. In the Gurage language of Wolane, qulf can mean “a long beam of wood extending from the main house to the medium-sized house with which one may secure the door of the mediumsized house.” In the same language qulf can also mean “return visit of a bride to her parents a few months after the wedding” indicating “the joining of her parents.” In Amharic (tä) qwälläfä is “join or buckle together.”142 As mentioned above ÷qlp appears to be an Afroasiatic root, although the Cushitic words of this type could be loans from Semitic. Also, however,



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 473
the Egyptian qÅb “double, double over, intestines” appears to be related to the Semitic forms. Canaanite has a root ÷qrb qereb “inward part, entrails.” On the other hand, there is a similar Semitic root ÷kpl “double, folded double.” In Arabic kafal is “a pair of buttocks etc.” A Canaanite passive participle kåpul would seem to be the origin of the Latin copula “link, chained together” hence the French and English “couple.” Ernout and Meillet see copula as coming from *co-apio–“join with.” They cannot explain the /l/. How can the varied meanings of the two clusters ÷qlp and ÷kpl be matched? The essential connection is “link.” This could be either the link between twins or the bond between the womb and the child. IndoEuropeanists have long puzzled over why the Indo-European root *bhrater “brother,” so strongly attested throughout the family, should have been replaced in Greek—as brother in the narrow sense—by ajdelfov". Frathvr in the broad sense of “kinsman” remained in use. Chantraine explains the a- in adelphos as coming from the Indo-European *sm`“same,” delfuv" “womb” first attested in medical works of Hippokrates in the fifth century BCE. No Indo-European etymology has been proposed for delphus itself. Greek anatomical terms are uncertain and there are at least two other words for womb: gasthvr, generally “belly” but sometimes the organ in which a woman “carries a child” and, second, uJstevra “uterus.” In any event, physical linking, often by a cord, is very important in the meaning of nearly all the terms containing delph-, and birth necessarily involves attachment to an umbilical cord. In Greece jOmfalovi “sacred stones” were sited in a number of cult places and have been associated with Mycenaean tombs. The most famous example of an omphalos was that associated with the cult of Apollo at Delphi. In antiquity it was supposed to signify the center of the earth. Nevertheless, omphalos also means “navel” and it is interesting to note that at Delphi the stone was sometimes decorated with what was supposed to be the skin of the Python Apollo had killed.143 This clearly had many symbolic meanings but one was that of an umbilical cord. The association with birth and connection by cord is central to nearly all the words and names associated with delph-. To begin with delphus “womb,” it was axiomatic in Greek medicine that the womb, hystera, floated throughout a woman’s body causing “hysteria” and needed to be stabilized or tied down.144



474 BLACK ATHENA
Delos
The idea of a floating womb that needs to be stabilized has an interesting parallel with the island of Dh'lo", the legendary birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. Despite the vowel difference—/e\/ (/a\/ in Dorian) as opposed to /e/—it seems likely that the island’s name is a reduced form of delfuv". The three major texts on the birth of Apollo on Delos are (1) the Homeric Hymn to the Deli–an Apollo, (2) fragments of Pindar’s Hymn to Zeus and another Paean and (3) the Hymn to Delos by the Hellenistic poet, Kallimakhos. The later texts elaborate on the story told in the earliest. Some of the more recent texts come from the poets’ originality (and desire to be original); others are derived from ancient sources. All three texts treat the puzzle of why such a small and barren island should have become the glorious birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. The gist of the Homeric hymn is that Lhtwv, impregnated by Zeus and pursued by ill-willed Hera, searched for a place to give birth to her twins. A list of prosperous islands refused through fear. Finally, she reached Delos. Given voice, the delighted Delos was frightened that she might be submerged and made Leto swear to protect the island and make it rich and famous. After being delayed by Hera, Eilithyia, goddess of childbirth, finally arrived and Leto immediately gave birth on Mount Kynthos, while holding on to a palm tree and by the stream jInwvpo". The derivation of Eilithyia from the Semitic root *>Elat “goddess” was proposed in Chapter 11.145 A possible Egyptian etymology of Kynthos was given in Chapter 10.146 As far as I am aware, no scholar has tried to explain the toponym Ino–pos. A clue is provided by the insistence that the divine births took place close to the stream.147 This assertion suggests an Egyptian etymology from ˆnpw “royal children.” Its vocalization is not known, but what appears to be a homonym, ˆnpw the god Anubis, was rendered Anu–p in Old Coptic and Anoubis in Greek. A long back vowel in the second syllable is suggested. Pindar enlarged the story with the claim that Delos was only the “mortal” name of the island, the immortal one was jAsteriva “star.” She was supposed to have been a nymph who fled Zeus from the heavens to become a floating island. Hesiod mentioned Asteria as a sister of Leto, an explanation that makes sense since Leto “the veiled one,” or night, should be related to Asteria the star.148 This could explain Leto’s choice of the island. Kallimakhos systematized the traditions of the Homeric hymns and Pindar. He saw Asteria as the earlier name of the wandering island



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 475
and Delos as the name of the island after it was fixed by four columns from the earth, to allow the birth of Apollo.149 This has Egyptian resonances in that in some of the most ancient traditions the sky was fixed and supported by four pillars  ̨ (N30x) on the cardinal points.150 At Delos the fixture was supposed to be so complete that, unlike the surrounding Cycladic islands, it never suffered earthquakes. Even so, anxiety about earthquakes did exist; Virgil refers to Apollo having: “found it [Delos] drifting about the sea from coast to coast; and, since it was his birthplace, in loyalty to his mother he chained it firmly to High Mykonos and Gyaros.”151 Why he should have mentioned the tiny island of Guvaro", more than fifty kilometers from Delos, is puzzling. Mention of Muvkono", less than two kilometers away, is not surprising. Indeed, Mykonos has a very plausible etymology, suitable for the myth, from the Semitic root ÷kwn “be firm” with the locative prefix m- vocalized in Hebrew as mEko\nåh “fixed resting place, base.” Even closer to Delos than Mykonos, across a strait of only 700 meters is the island of JRhvneia, JRhvnaia or JRhvnh. It was also sometimes known as jOrtugiva “quail island.” According to the Homeric hymn however, Artemis was born in Ortygia, which was distinguished from Delos. Strabo maintained that Ortygia referred to Rheneia.152 The idea that Delos was the birthplace of Apollo and Ortygia/Rheneia was that of his twin Artemis could explain why in the late sixth century BCE Polykrates, tyrant of Samos, set up a chain linking the two islands, ostensibly offering Rheneia to Apollo.153 Another reason could be the need to stabilize Delos. Polykrates’ actual chain may have been the inspiration for Virgil’s myth of a chain tying Delos to Mykonos. There are a number of plausible Egyptian etymologies for the name Rheneia. From a phonetic point of view the best is from rny “calf.”154 The Coptic roun–e indicates an earlier diphthong including /a–/. A form *ra–?ne corresponds well to the Greek Rheneia. Naming a smaller island that is close to a larger one “calf ” is not uncommon; see, for instance, the Calf of Man off the Isle of Man. Thus Rheneia, although bigger than Delos, could be the “calf of Mykonos.” Rny belongs to a larger cluster *rn with the general meaning “young.” With different orthographies rnn
can mean “rejoice, caress, bring up, nurse” r (B6) and rnnt is “(wet-)
nurse.” Rnnt is the nurse goddess.” A toponym from this source is suitable for the birthplace of a goddess. Many scholars have discussed an Egyptian parallel to the myth of Delos, a “floating island” cevmmi" where Apollo and Artemis were born.



476 BLACK ATHENA
Herodotos explained that in Egypt Apollo is Horus and Artemis was Bubastis.155 The modern scholar Peter Bing differentiates between the two traditions; he points out that in the Egyptian version the island only begins to float once the divine children are born, whereas their birth stabilized Delos, which had been floating. Bing agrees, however, that there are many other Egypto-Greek parallels between the two traditions. Some of these first appear in Kallimakhos’ poem and, therefore, can be explained as attempts to please his Ptolemaic patron. Other parallels are more difficult to dismiss. The image of Leto giving birth while holding on to a palm tree—possible but unlikely on a bare Cycladic islandappears in the Homeric hymn.156 It is also interesting to note that Kynthos, the name of the mountain on which the divine twins were born, can be plausibly derived from KÅ ntr.157 It is also possible, as claimed above, that the river Inopos had an Egyptian etymology. There is no attestation before Kallamakhos of the idea that the Inopos was directly linked to the Nile. After his poem such ideas are quite frequent.158 The approximate resemblance of two such intimately connected toponyms as Delphi and Delos makes a common origin extremely likely. The same is true of the word delphus “womb,” which was both “the organ tied down” and the source of the umbilical cord. The idea of linkage between a small and large also helps explain delphax “sow” with her suckling piglets. The suffix -ax is used for animals and inferior humans. The origin of Delphis, Delphinos is much more difficult to find. One possibility is that it was related to a pig because of its pig-like snout. In both Sumerian and Akkadian, the name for the constellation Delphinus was “pig.”159 Finally, there is davfnh (H) the laurel sacred to Apollo. The inability to find an Indo-European root and the wide variety of dialect forms lead Frisk and Chantraine to describe it as an “unexplained Mediterranean word,” although one variant, lavfnh, encourages them to see a relationship to the Latin laurus. Given the cultic connections, Daphne@ would seem more likely to be a metathesized derivation from *delph.
Conclusion on Apollo and Artemis
Apollo was a god of the rising sun, rebirth, apotheosis and healing; Artemis was the divinity of sunset, nightfall, hunting and, later, childbirth. They demonstrate the complexity of eastern Mediterranean religion in the Bronze and Early Iron ages. Some aspects appear to be purely Greek: the emphasis on the twins’ archery and Apollo’s traveling by



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 477
chariot—whereas Horus, H°prr and Tm sailed across the sky by boat. Other features indicate Semitic influence: epithets such as Ismenos with its links to healing; the river name Ladon; the important root qwElf; the name Leto, the unaspirated version of the name Apollo and the fact that the divinity of sunset was female.160 The basis of these two divinities, however, was Egyptian and included the three phases of the sun; the names Apollo and Artemis, Kynthos and Inopos; the floating island; and links to healing and revival, as well as to lions and the sphinx. There are also the connections to childbirth, apotheosis and music discussed in Chapter 10. The result of this gallimaufrey is not merely confusing but splendidly rich.
OTHER OLYMPIANS
In earlier chapters I discussed the name Aphrodite; those of Hermes and Athena will be considered later.161 Ares’ name does not appear in Linear B, but Enuwarijo, jEnuavlio" a god of war later confused with Ares, is attested. Frisk states, “Pre-Greek name of unsure formation and unknown etymology.” Chantraine agrees. The etymology, like that of the warrior goddess jEnuwv is, in fact, obvious. It comes from ˆn  ̇rt, later known as Onuris, the Egyptian god of war.162 The name }Hfaisto" does not appear in Linear B, but Ventris and Chadwick plausibly suppose that man’s name Apaitijo is derived from it.163 Chantraine describes the etymology of Hephaistos as “particularly obscure.” Hephaistos’ Egyptian counterpart or prototype as craftsman god was Pth≥ Ptah.164 The metathesis *H≥pt would fit nicely with (H) Apaitijo, although the /s/ in Hephaistos offers some difficulty. In general, I would not accept this metathesis. In this case, however, the tight semantic fit and the possibility of religious taboos or alternations make it permissible. This name does appear in the correct consonantal order in Pausanias’ description of the ancient sanctuary of Apollo at Troizen mentioned earlier in this chapter. According to legend, the sanctuary was built by Pitqevu", Pittheus a son of Pelops, who came from Elis to rule Troizen. In Egypt, Ptah, as well as Atum, was paired with the lion goddess, Sekhmet whose Greek counterpart was Artemis. A temple to the latter was found in the marketplace at Troizen. This temple had altars to the gods of the Underworld. At Memphis, the trinity Ptah, Sokaris and Osiris were seen as the gods and judges of the Underworld. In connection with the altars,



478 BLACK ATHENA
Pausanias referred to Osiris’ Greek counterpart Dionysos. He went on to describe the “tomb of Pittheus” behind this temple, on which stood “three chairs of white marble. They say that Pittheus and two men with him sat as judges on these chairs.”165 He continued: “Not far off is the is a sanctuary of the Muses: They said it was made by Ardalus son of Hephaistus. . . . Here they say that, Pittheus gave lessons in the art of rhetoric. I have myself read a book by a man of Epidauros, which purports to be a treatise by Pittheus.”166 In Memphite theology Ptah was worshipped for having given life to the other gods through his tongue and command of speech. An association of Ptah with the tongue is also made in the Book of Going Forth by Day and “writings” may also have been associated with the god.167
ZEUS NSW
The identification of Zeus with Am(m)on certainly goes back to the fifth century with the striking phrase attributed to the poet Pindar: “Ammon lord of Olympos.” In fact the close links between the ancient oracle of Zeus at Dodona and those of Am(m)on at Siwa and Thebes suggest that the identification of the two gods was far older.168 In the section on Zeus in his Greek Religion Walter Burkert pinpoints the discrepancy between the name and nature of Zeus:
Zeus is the only name of a Greek god which is entirely transparent etymologically, and which indeed has long been paraded as a model case of Indo-European philology. The same name appears in the Indic sky god Dyaus pita, in the Roman Diespiter/Juppiter, in the Germanic Tues-day, and the root is found in the Latin deus, god, dies, day and in the Greek eudia, fair weather. Zeus is therefore the Sky Father, the luminous day sky . . . . Only for Greeks and Romans is the Sky Father the highest god, and he is so primarily as a rain and storm god: Zeus is much more a weather god than the etymology would suggest.169
Furthermore, Zeus and Jupiter are royal gods while the Hindu Dyaus pita, and the Teutonic Tiwe are unimportant members of their panthea. At this point it is useful to note that this Greek god had two major names: Di'o" and Zeuv". Chantraine sees these names as resting on two
themes: (1) *dei-w- from which the Latin di\uvos and the Sanskrit devá (and



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 479
of course the Greek Dios) (2) *dy-eu, *dy e\u- from which he derives Zeus. There is no doubt about the first theme, the second and the connection between diwe and Zeus are much more conjectural. As Herodotos did not include Zeus among the divine names of nonEgyptian origin, one should seriously consider an Egyptian etymology. It is striking to note that Zeus was not equated with the Egyptian Ra, god of the bright sun in the sky, but with Amon the royal god, identified with oracles, rams and thunder. The image of Amon as royal god was linked to Thebes as the national capital. Thus it is attested in the Twelfth Theban Dynasty and again in the Eighteenth, when the title Nsw Ntrw “king of the gods” is attested.170 Nsw<Nzw on its own provides an excellent etymon for Zeus. The Greek form Amonraswnqhr AmonRa-so–nthe–r shows that the initial n- in nsw was dropped, though it may possibly have voiced the following sibilant to become /z/ (nthe–r is the Coptic plural for “gods.)”171 Although in this rendition the -w became an -o@, in Chapter 6, when discussing the derivation of the suffix -eus from the Egyptian -w, I took up Albright’s argument that in Egyptian /u–/ could epenthesize to /eu–/.172 This shift appears to have occurred at the end of the Second Millennium, which would be when the name Zeus was introduced. There is no mention of this name in Mycenaean texts, while the Diwe is present and his pairing with Hera/ Era confirms the obvious connection not only with the later Dios but also with the later Zeus.173 The situation is further confused by other names for Zeus: Za–vn, accusative Zh`n(a). This name can plausibly be derived from the Canaanite term for “small cattle, sheep and goatsso`>n <*sa`>n. Both Amon and Zeus were identified with rams. The least unlikely explanatory scheme is to suppose that in Mycenaean times a god had the characteristics of Amon but, like the latter, the name means “hidden.” He had a secret name and was simply called by the Indo-European Diwe “sky, god.” At some point at the end of the Bronze Age the Egyptian name *Zeu, which resembled Diwe, and the Canaanite *sa`>n were introduced and merged with Diwe to form the confused and varied declensions found in different dialects.
OTHER GODS
In earlier chapters I have provided Egyptian etymologies for other gods, including Plou'to", {Aidh" and Daveira.174 In Volume 2, I proposed to derive the name of the old crone goddess of magic JEkavth from the



480 BLACK ATHENA
Egyptian frog fertility goddess, H≥qt, with possible influences from H≥kÅw “magic.”175 According to an Akkadian transcription, the name of Ra’s female partner RŒt was pronounced Riya. This makes it a good candidate to be the etymon of JReva The difference between RŒt as a solar or sky goddess and Rhea as a chthonic divinity associated with caves is reconciled by RŒt ‘s attested identification with the sky goddess Nwt. It should be noted that Nwt’s stellar figure was painted on the ceilings of tombs and coffins covering the second birth of the dead person, just as Rhea protected the young Zeus. In Hellenistic times, Rhea was identified with Nwt. For the derivation of the name Pa–vn from *pÅ ˆm “the groan” and other sources, see the appropriate section in Volume 2.176 See also the Egyptian etymology of [Atla" and the possible Sumerian one of jWkeanov" there.177 The Egyptian etymologies of Oujranov" and Krovno" have been given in earlier chapters.178
HERODOTOS’ NON-EGYPTIAN DIVINE NAMES
Herodotos’ statement that “the names of nearly all the gods came to Greece from Egypt” is made more plausible by his list of exceptions: Poseidon, the Dioskouroi, Hera, Hestia, Themis, the Graces, and the Ne–reids. Hestia, Themis and the Graces have clear Indo-European etymologies. Dioskouroi means merely “divine youths.” Thus, although kouros was a very early loan from Egyptian, the combined form Dioskouroi can fairly be described as Greek.179 In Volume 1, I proposed that the name Poseidon was a mixed form with the Egyptian prefixes pÅ- “the” or pr- “house” and the West Semitic city name Sido–n derived from the name Si ̆d, god of hunting. This proposal is uncertain but I have yet to see a more convincing one.180 Volume 2 further considers Poseidon as a god of oases and chariots.181 I discussed the Semitic origin of Ne–reus and the Ne–reids in Chapter 14.182 This leaves the name Hera, which with those of the related hero, was discussed in Volume 2.183 Other divinities not among those listed by Herodotos as nonEgyptian have more or less clear Semitic origins. These include Gaia and Demeter, as discussed in Chapter 5; Eileithyia discussed in Chapter 11; and Hermes discussed in Chapter 21.184 Chantraine writes about the divine name {Aidh" “many uncertain hypotheses which there is not



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 481
space to repeat.” Hades the punishing god of the Underworld has a reasonable derivation from the Mesopotamian and Syrian god Hd(d) Hadad “storm god” or “thunderer.” The derivation of [Adwni" from the Semitic ŒÅdôn, “lord” has been universally accepted.185
DEMIGODS
In Volume 1, I proposed that the “noble” >’Irpt rendered jOrpai" in Greek together with the suffix -euv" (from the Egyptian -w) made up the name jOrfeuv".186 The link between the Egyptian Œntyw, a form of Seth, and Herakles’ opponent jAntai'o" was established in Volume 2.187 In the first book of the Iliad, Achilles refers to the triumph of his mother Thetis in rescuing Zeus by calling up to Olympos “him of the hundred hands . . . Briavrew",” who defeated the combined forces of Hera, Poseidon and Athena.188 In addition to the one hundred arms, Hesiod granted him fifty heads as well as great power.189
In Chapter 10 there was a discussion of the Egyptian bÅ  ̇ (G29) “soul-bird.”190 The plural bÅw had the special meaning of “souls of the dead, world soul, power, strength.” It was sometimes written as b-Å-w
with the divine determinative _ (A40). It was, usually, simply H (G30). The likelihood that this form was also sometimes pronounced *bÅÅw is increased by the attestation of a word bÅÅwt “virility.” Even *bÅ(y)Åw or *bÅÅ(y)w are made possible by the attestation of the form bÅyw “Ba-like creatures.” The Demotic by and the Coptic bai also suggest the presence of a front vowel. Divinity, strength and above all, multiplicity provide an excellent semantic correspondence of bÅ(Å)w with briareo\s, enough to overcome the phonetic difficulties. The origin of the name [jInaco" “king and river” from Œnh°was discussed in Chapter 10.191 The obvious derivation of the Kavbeiroi from the Semitic Kabir “great, noble” seen by Scaliger and Bochart, but denied by mainstream classicists since K. O. Müller is discussed in Volumes 1 and 2.192 The Egyptian origin of the Moi'rai was discussed in Chapter 10, as was Nevmesi", in Chapter 12.193 In Volume 2, I discussed at length the derivation of Mivnw" from the Egyptian Mn.194 I also derived the name of his brother JRadamavnqu" from *Rdˆ Mntw “Mntw gives” or “has given.”195 In his criticism of my



482 BLACK ATHENA
work John Baines argued that Mntw was “a second rank Egyptian deity” restricted to the Theban nome in Upper Egypt and, therefore, could not have had significant influence on the Aegean or specifically on Crete.196 I responded by reiterating that Mntw was the patron god of the Eleventh Dynasty, of the pharaohs named Mntw h≥tp who arose in that district. The famous Tôd Treasure of trophies from the north made by pharoahs of the succeeding Twelfth Dynasty was found in the temple of Mntw. The Eleventh Dynasty ruled during the decades around 2000 BCE when the Cretan palaces were founded.197 In Volume 2, I gave grounds for identifying [Ogka the biname of Athena at Thebes, near the Lado@n “dragon” river, with the Egyptian goddess Œnqt who was later rendered Anukis goddess of the cataracts.198 Since writing this, I have found that Apollo at the irregularly gushing waters of the Lado–n near Thelpousa in Arkadia was known as jOgkeiavta".199
Also in Volume 2, I derived Phvgaso" (H) from three Egyptian sources pgs “to spit out,” *pÅ gh≥s “the gazelle” and gs “speed.200 Looked at from an Afroasiatic perspective the last two can be derived from the related roots *gas/*gus “move” and *gaso> “antelope” attested in the Old Egyptian gsÅ. Michael Astour has set out in great detail the Semitic (Aramaic) origin of Bellerofw`n from *Beœel rp>(n) “Baal of healing.”201
MYTHICAL CREATURES
Monsters and enemies
The Egyptian or Semitic derivations of Lapivqai, Fleguai, Suvbari" and Lavmia± have all been discussed earlier in this chapter.202 In Chapter 10, I proposed Egyptian etymologies for Kevntauroi and Savturoi.203 The Egyptian derivation of Gorgon will be set out in the last chapter. Fovrku~ was seen as a sea god, or the old man of the sea, spirit of the deep and flux, and a monster and the father of monsters. Phorkys has no Indo-European etymology but can plausibly be derived from pÅ wÅ∆ˆ “the flood.”204
Minor goddesses: Nymphs and Muses
The Egyptian names of Zeus’ paramours include Iwv discussed in Volume 1, and, in Volume 2, Semevlh from smÅt “royal consort” and



[CH. 19] DIVINE NAMES 483
Alkmh`nh, from *r∆t ˆmn “friend of Amon.”205 The Semitic origin of Lhtwv was noted earlier in this chapter.206 Much of Chapter 11 is devoted to the extra-Hellenic aspects of the natures and names of nymphs and Muses. Specifically, there were the derivations of Adrasteiva, who sheltered the infant Zeus or Dionysos from Drt ndst; “lesser kite” a biname for Nepthys who mourned for and revived Osiris; and the horned jAmavlqeia from ˆmÅt “female ibex.”207
SOME HEROES
The complexities surrounding the name and nature of Herakles and of the word hero itself were discussed in Volume 2.208 The possible SemitoEgyptian derivation from *>ahi° rw “my brother is a lion” of jAcil(l)euv" was set out with Phleivwn *pÅ rw “the lion.”209 I discussed the rich cluster of Egyptian and Semitic roots behind the name Danaov" in Volume 1.210 The derivation of jEndumivwn from the Egyptian ndm “sweet” was proposed in Chapter 12.211 The attested personal name Ddw mnw “whom Min gives” provides a reasonable etymology for jIdomineuv" (Idomenijo in Linear B) prince of Crete and grandson of Minos.212 The clear, although complex, relations between the Cretan Minos and the African Min are examined in some detail in Volume 2.213 The origin of the name Qhseuv" from the Egyptian tsw “commander” was set out in Chapter 5.214 Kavdmo" and the name’s clear derivation from the Semitic root ÷qdm have been mentioned many times throughout all three volumes of this project. The possible derivation of Kevkroy, founder of Athens, from the prenomena of the Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs known as Senwosret
H°pr kÅ Rœ I; H°œ h°pr Rœ II and H°œ kÅw Rœ III, will be debated in Chapter 22.215 The Egypto-Syrian etymologies of Melavmpou" and Mevroy were proposed in Chapter 18.216 Chantraine subsumes the name Nestwr under the verb nevomai “to return.” He plausibly derives this from a form *nevsomai for which, with even less certainty, he finds an Indo-European root. All that we know about Nestor from tradition is that his father was called Nhleuv" and that he reigned for two to three generations at Pylos and in his old age went on the Trojan expedition where with more or less success he acted as a bore and peacemaker. Unlike the other Greek heroes, he returned



484 BLACK ATHENA
home without too much difficulty, hence the possibility of linking his name with neomai. Nel\eus closely resembles Nel\eus, god of the sea, whose Semitic etymology was discussed in Chapter 14.217 Another origin for Nestor could well be from the attested Egyptian title Nst wr “great throne.”218 Such a title would have been appropriate for Pylos; we know from the Linear B archive a rich and powerful state existed there in the thirteenth century BCE.219 Furthermore use of an office as a title is frequent and as a title rather than a person, it would explain Nestor’s longevity. The derivation of jOdusseuv" from wdyt “expedition” was referred to above.220
CONCLUSION
This chapter is an attempt to vindicate Herodotos’ statement quoted at the beginning: “The names of nearly all the gods came from Egypt.” The fact that the exceptions to his list have reasonable Indo-European or Semitic etymologies make his claim all the more plausible. The focus of this chapter has been on inexplicable, mysterious mythological and legendary names and, thereby, neglects those with sound Indo-European etymologies. Nevertheless, I believe, that this chapter enables us to go beyond Herodotos’ claim for the gods and show that the majority of other names found in Greek mythology and tradition are primarily Egyptian and secondarily West Semitic.

CHAPTER 20
GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND
PLACE-NAMES
INTRODUCTION
P
lace-names are, if anything, more durable than words. They can tell one as much or more than language about both prehistory and history. Unlike other words, they often survive the disappearance of the languages that formed them. Their linguistic provenance can provide important evidence on the languages of the populations or rulers in the distant past. In the United States and Canada, for instance, eighteen states and three provinces have names not amenable to analysis in any European language. As they stretch from Quebec and Massachusetts in the east to Utah and Idaho in the west, one could deducewithout historical or current linguistic evidence—that Pre-Columbian populations existed across North America before the arrival of Europeans. On the other hand, four states in the Southwest (California, Nevada, Colorado and Montana) and one in the Southeast (Florida) have Spanish names indicating Spanish settlement, or at least influence, in these regions. Typically, however, political names are less conservative than those of natural features or even than those of towns and villages. In England, apart from London and those to which the Latin-castrum was attached, very few Celtic town names remain. Nevertheless, the most frequent river names—Avon, Derwent, Dart, Don, Ouse and Trent—are mainly British,



486 BLACK ATHENA
while some like the Thames (Temis) and Severn are even pre-Celtic. Both facts are striking since Britain became Celtic-speaking more than 2,500 years ago and because British (Welsh) has not been spoken in England, apart from Cornwall, for at least 1,400 years. Absence can also be indicative. We know that England was conquered by Normans in 1066 CE and ruled by French speakers for the next three hundred years. Yet, very few French toponyms can be found; the migrations of Saxons and Danes, whose languages have provided most placenames, were far more substantial. In the Balkan peninsula as a whole nearly all toponyms can be derived from Indo-European. Greece is the great exception—virtually none of its ancient place-names can be explained by Indo-European. For this reason classicists have almost completely given up trying to understand or write about them. No book-length study on the subject has appeared since Adolf Fick’s Vorgriechische Ortsnamen als Quelle für die Vorgeschichte Griechenlands came out in 1905.1 Fick’s book has very little phonetic and absolutely no semantic discipline. His only detectable system was a refusal to consider the most obvious Semitic etymologies, as with, for instance, his explicit denial that the Greek river name Iardavno" could be derived from the Canaanite Yarde\n, Jordan “descending river.”2 For Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s attempt to discredit this obvious loan, see below. Since Fick’s attempt and the ill-fated venture of Blegen and Haley described in Volume 1, classicists have left Greek place-names strictly alone.3 Jasanoff and Nussbaum justify this failure when they write, “names, in principle, can mean almost anything.”4 I cannot accept this approach because I believe that, while names are often repeated simply as names, the originals nearly always had a meaning, particularly in the case of place-names. Frequently, we fail to understand the meaning of a placename simply because we do not know, or are not aware that we know, the language from which it was constructed. Nevertheless, before supposing that a specific name derives from an unknown language we should check to see if it can be explained by one that is known and understood. I am convinced that the reason why Greek toponymy has not progressed is that nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars have seen these place-names as remnants of unknown, lost pre-Hellenic languages. Seldom, if ever, have they considered the possibility that many toponyms can plausibly be explained in terms of Ancient Egyptian or Semitic. My approach here is not “undisciplined,” as my critics complain. In looking for the etymologies of Greek place-names, I insist that (1) there



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 487
must be a good phonetic fit and either (2) the proposed Afroasiatic etymon should be attested as a place-name or (3) the proposed etymon should fit the physical features of the place named. Previous scholars have not considered this last criterion.
NATURAL FEATURES
Islands
As with other toponyms, island names sometimes slip from one place to another. For instance, the ancient name Mona once applied to the island now known as Anglesey and is now applied to the Isle of Man. The name Thule has shifted from Iceland to Greenland and is even the origin of Foula in the Shetlands. The insular names of the Aegean, however, are exceptionally unstable. If, for instance, one compares the Cycladic with the Orcadian archipelago the contrast is striking. In Orkney, apart from the two toponyms Pomona and the mainland, all the dozens of others have distinct and fixed names. In the Cyclades, as we shall see, the situation is far more fluid. The difference can partly be explained by time: the Orcadian names have been recorded for only a thousand years, whereas in the Cyclades the time depth has been three or four times as great. The other explanation is the polyglot nature of the Cyclades, where Indo-Hittite, Egyptian, West Semitic and Indo-European were all spoken, often simultaneously, for many millennia.
Before beginning to list the island names, we should consider the word Nh'so" (H) “island” itself. Chantraine declares that the etymology is “unknown.” The meaning of ne\sos is not altogether straightforward. It was used for peninsulas and also for alluvium covered by the Nile. I propose a derivation from the Egyptian nst. This word is literally “throne,” how
ever, in place-names it is sometimes written with the determinative v
(N36) “irrigation channel” or “irrigated land.” This form would suggest a parallel with the Nile alluvium. More to the point the plural Nswt tÅwy was used for mountains and deserts away from the Nile.5 Finally, nst could mean “seat” in a wider sense, a town, a ruler or even a people. Thus, it provides a reasonable etymology for nes–os.
ISLAND NAMES. Anavfh, Membliavro". In the seventeenth century Samuel Bochart derived the name of this tiny island close to Thera, from the



488 BLACK ATHENA
Hebrew ŒÅnåp, “shady.”6 He based this derivation on a passage from the Argonautica of Apollonios of Rhodes: “[After a pall of darkness] and straightway dawn arose and gave them light: and they [the Argonauts] made for Apollo a glorious abode in a shady wood, and a shady altar, calling on Phoebus the “Gleamer” [aigle\te\s] because of the gleam farseen; and that bare island they called Anaphe. . . .”7 Bochart’s etymology is thus possible but no more than that. Astour derives Anaphe from the West Semitic >a ̈nåphå “a type of owl.” Michael Astour is interested in the passage quoted above and an earlier one: “. . . as they sped over the wide Cretan sea, night scared them, that night which they name the Pall of Darkness: the stars pierced not that fatal night nor the beams of the moon, but black chaos descended from heaven, or haply some other darkness came rising from the nethermost depths.”8 Astour is concerned with the name Membliavro". Herodotos described this personage as a Phoenician related to Kadmos who had settled in Thera, then called Kalliste. His descendents had lived on the island for eight generations before the arrival of the legendary Theras, the eponym of Thera.9 Astour argues on the basis of a statement from Stephanus of Byzantius that originally Membliaros was not a person but the old name of Anaphe–. On the basis of Apollonios’ dramatic picture of utter darkness, Astour derives the name from a Phoenician *Me–mbli >år “water without light.” He goes on to relate this to Apollonios’ description of the “pall of darkness” and to Hebrew and Mesopotamian creation myths in which god’s light spreads over the darkened chaotic waters.10 Astour’s derivation is plausible, but there would seem to be more to it. “The Pall of Darkness: the stars pierced not that fatal night nor the beams of the moon, but black chaos descended from heaven, or haply some other darkness came rising from the nethermost depths” is a good description of volcanic darkness following the Thera eruption. Thus whether Membliaros refers to Thera or to Anaphe– or to both, Astour’s etymology from *Me–mbli >år is very plausible.
JApiva. The derivation of Apia, an ancient name for Argos or the whole Peloponnese, from the Egyptian H≥p was discussed in Volume 1.11
jAstupavlaia, Kov". Astypalaia is a common place-name. Stephanus Byzantinus lists five instances.12 In Chapter 22, I shall argue later that Asty “city” derives from the Egyptian st “place, grounds.”13 As a whole,



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 489
Astypalaia is probably a hybrid with -palaia simply meaning “ancient.” Skymnos of Chios and Stephanus Byzantinus, however, mention alternative forms puvlaion or puvlaia and, thereby, open the possibility that it is purely Egyptian.14 The Coptic se makes it clear that st was usually pronounced on its own. It was, however, frequently compounded. There is, however, no example of this with pr *por. On the other hand, as st is
frequently written with the determinative ! (O1) pr, there would be no
need to duplicate it. In any event the name Astypalaia is a city rather than an island toponym. The Cycladic island may have gained its name from its capital with a striking acropolis. Strabo stated that Astypalaia was the original name of the larger and more significant Kos.15 Stephanus says merely that it was the name of what had been the major city in Kos.16 Kos was the base of the Asklepiads, the birthplace of Hippocrates and the center of Greek medicine. Astour makes an elegant case for deriving the island name from the West Semitic kôs “a kind of owl.” He does this in three ways. First, he cites an argument made by Victor Bérard about two other names, [Aki" and Meropivh–, both applying to the island of Siphnos. Bérard related Akis to the Semitic aku “owl” but akos also meant “remedy” and akis “recovery” in Greek. The pair formed what Bérard called a Greek/Semitic doublet.17 (In my view, the allegedly “Greek” word, in this case akos, is in fact derived from the Egyptian ŒqÅ. 18) In Chapter 18, I accepted Bérard and Astour’s derivation of Meropie\ from the West Semitic mErappe> “healer.”19 Astour’s second argument comes from the name Meropie\being applied to Kos, which, as stated above, is a West Semitic word for type of owl associated with medicine. The third argument is that the legendary king of the island Mevroy had a son and successor Eu[mhlo" who became a Nuktikovrax, a “night crow.” This term was used in the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew kôs. Furthermore, Eumel\os’ daughter Meropis was turned into an “owl” glau`x.20 Altogether, the net is too intricate and dense to deny the derivation of the island name Kos from the West Semitic Kôs “owl.”
Dh'lo", RJh'neia. The Semitic origin of Delos and the Egyptian one of Rheneia were discussed in the last chapter.21
jIqavka, Attika and jItuvkh. Three toponyms share the same syllabic structure: *VtVka jIqavka, the Greek island and a town on the



490 BLACK ATHENA
Euphrates; Attika, the territory around Athens; and Ituke\(Utica), the city near Carthage in what is now Tunisia. The meaning of the Semitic root ÷Œtq is to “pass, supercede.” In Hebrew Œåtêq could mean “eminent, surpassing” but in Aramaic and later Hebrew Œatîq meant “surpassed, ancient, old.” No doubt the Punic city Utica gained its name from the passive Pual form Œûtaq “was surpassed.” It was surpassed by Carthage, Qarta h≥a=dåßtå “New Town.”22 The existence of an Ithaca on the Euphrates strongly suggests that this toponym, which has no Indo-European or Egyptian etymology, is Semitic, but it is difficult to say whether it means “preeminent” or “ancient.”23 The first interpretation is reinforced by Ithaca’s early dominance over Kefallenia and Zakynthos.24 The last interpretation could point in the direction of “ancient” if there is any possibility that the name derived from that of the people. The same ambiguity holds for tracing the name to Attika, although “ancient” is more likely given the Athenian boasts of their antiquity and the region’s standing out from the Dorian invasion. Ernout and Meillet want to derive antiquus from ante “in front of ” but they are baffled by the final -quo which they admit is not an Indo-European suffix. It would seem simpler to derive it from Œatîq. A parallel introduction of a nasal can be found in the etymology of the name Antonius from the Canaanite >a=dônî “my lord.”
“Ikaro". The island of Ikaros or Ikaria is generally associated with the unfortunate Ikaros who flew too high. Another hero jIkarivo", however, was the first planter of grapes.25 He was associated with a deme of his name in Attika but also with the island of Ikaria. The city of Oinoe is famous for its grapes and in ancient times claimed to be the earliest site of wine production in Greece. The etymology would seem to be from the Canaanite >Ikkår “laborer, planter,” from the Akkadian ikkaru and ultimately from the Sumerian agar “irrigated land.”26
Krhvth. Crete is not only the largest island in the Aegean but by far the highest. Mount Ida is not merely a thousand meters higher than mountains on any other Aegean island but also, with the exception of Olympos, it is higher than any on mainland Greece. The Egyptian qÅÅ, qÅt and qÅyt “high, height” are all used as toponyms.27 Despite the fact that there is no evidence from Egyptian texts of the name having been applied to the island, qÅt provides a reasonable etymology for Kre\te.\



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 491
Kuvqhra. The names of, and on, this island provide a classic case of Victor Bérard’s principle of “doublets” two names, one Greek and one Semitic, for the same geographical feature. In Volume 1, I listed all the Semitic associations of the island, which was a cult center of the crowned Aphrodite. Bérard saw Kythe–ra as deriving from the West Semitic, found in the Hebrew keter, kote–ret “crown,” and the “Greek” Skavndeia “a kind of headdress” as the name of the island’s chief harbor.28 In a footnote, I pointed out that Skandeia itself derived from the Egyptian Sh°mty the “double crown of Egypt.”29 This example together with that of akis, mentioned above, indicates that in at least some cases the doublet is Semitic and Egypto-Greek.
Lh'mno", Levsbo". The name Le–mnos would seem, like limhvn “harbor, port,” to come from the Egyptian *r-mny “place of mooring.” The Bay of Mydros on the island provides one of the best harbors in the Aegean. In ancient times Le@mnos had an active volcano and consequently a cult of Hephaistos. The west of Lesbos is also volcanic, unstable with hot springs. Bérard saw volcanic signs in Lesbian toponymy. He took as a doublet, the towns of Pyrrha “fiery” and Issa, which he believed derived from the Semitic >Is(=t) “fire.”30 The etymology of Lesbos itself, which is generally described as “pre-Hellenic” can plausibly be derived from the Middle Egyptian Åsb “fierce, glowing” and Åsbyw “flames” and the form nsb found in the Book of Coming Forth by Day.
Mh'lo". Stephanus stated that Me@los was first colonized by Phoenicians from Byblos.31 This would certainly suggest a Semitic etymology for the name. Movers, Lewy and Astour all claim that it derives from the root ÷ml> “full.” They back this by seeing Kallimakhos’ use of a variant form Mimallis as deriving from the participle mEmalle>.32 This might seem plausible at a phonetic level, but, semantically it makes no sense. A more likely root is ÷mlh≥, ultimately deriving from the Nostratic root and *÷mul/mol “to rub, crush, mill.”33 The basic meaning of ÷mlh≥ is “salt” but this has been extended in two directions: In Ugaritic and Arabic the form also has the general meaning of “good.” In Arabic it is also combined with other linguistic units to name various minerals, many of which were abundant in Me–los.
Muvkono". A derivation of Mykonos from a Canaanite form found in the Hebrew mEkon–åh “fixed place, base” was proposed in the last chapter.34



492 BLACK ATHENA
Navxo". For the origin of Naxos from n∆t ˆ, see Chapter 16.35
Salamiv". Stephanus knew that the Arabian word for “peace” was salama.36 It is not clear, however, that the ancients connected the word with the eastern Mediterranean toponym Salamis. More recent scholars have derived it from the Semitic root ÷slm “health, safety, peace.”37 The island of Salamis in the Saronic Gulf opposite Athens has a western harbor that is sheltered from all points of the compass. Scholars have long seen that Savrwn, which gained its name from the coastal plain north of Troizen, derived from the toponym from the Palestinian coastal plain Íårôn.38 The Salamis on Cyprus was on a bay on the sheltered east coast, where there were abundant Phoenician settlements in the First Millennium BCE. The shape of the Greek toponym Salam instead of the later Canaanite S+ålôm, however, indicates that the name was borrowed in the Bronze Age. It remains an exact parallel to today’s Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
Savmo", Savmh and Samoqra/vkh. The geographer Strabo wrote that toponyms with the element Sam- came from an old word for “high.”39 This is generally confirmed by the geography of eastern Samos, which has peaks higher than those on surrounding capes and islands. It is also true of the western one, later Same\and later still Kephalonia; it is also true of Samothrace. Geography makes it difficult to include Samikovn in this cluster as it appears to have been applied to a marshy plain. Samothrace has strong Phoenician connections through the cult of the Kabeiroi.40 As scholars have known for centuries, Samos certainly corresponds to the Semitic root ÷smh “high” found in the Arabic sama\> “high” and the Phoenician s=mm “heaven, high places” and the Hebrew s=åmayîm “heavens.”41
Sevrifo". In mythology, Seriphos is the island where Perseus and his mother Danae were cast up in an iron chest. Approached from the sea, Seriphos appears dry, treeless and forbidding. Hidden valleys, however, are green and famous for their “serifian” frogs.42 Astour is attracted by the strong phonetic parallel between Seriphos and the Hebrew s;årap “burn” particularly and s;åråp “fiery serpent.”43 This is just possible given the burnt-up appearance of the island.



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 493
Sivfno". Siphnos has been mentioned above in the section on Astypalaia and Kos because of its doublet [Aki" and Meropivh@. The name Siphnos itself has a plausible Semitic etymology. Bochart derived it from ÷ sp`n in the sense of “treasure,” as the island was famous for its gold and silver mines.44
CONCLUSION ON ISLANDS. The high proportion of Semitic island names found in this selection—twelve as opposed to four with plausible Egyptian names—seems to confirm the possibility of Semitic influences. Earlier scholars from Bochart to Levin have carried out much of the work in this area. Indeed, almost the only original ideas in this section are the proposed Egyptian etymologies for Crete and Lesbos. Whether or not earlier Indo-Hittite or Egyptian forms underlie Aegean toponymy, they were largely obscured by Semitic names. Thucydides statement that in olden times Carians and Phoenicians had lived on the islands is, thus, backed up.45
Some mountain names
Mountain names can be the most conservative toponyms. Far away from coastal and riverine influences, mountains are relatively unaffected by population movements and settlements. Against this isolation is the tendency for those on the plains to name mountains and for newcomers to conquer them and particularly to crown the highest peaks with new names. See, for instance, Mount Everest and Mounts Washington, McKinley etc. Be that as it may, in Greece few if any mountains have Indo-Hittite or Indo-European names. Most appear to have come from Egyptian or Semitic and to have become assimilated into Greek as names. Before proposing some Afroasiatic etymologies for Greek mountain names, I should like to consider the most common word for “mountain, hill country” >o\ro". In the genitive this has the variants oureos and o\roes. It is attested in the Linear B orea2. Frisk sees it as a verbal noun of the
verb o[rnumai, ojrevsqai “to rush, raise oneself.” He and Chantraine also raise the possibility that it could be linked to the Sanskrit rs``vá “high.” A Semitic etymology from forms vocalized in Hebrew as har, plural hårîm, “mountain, hill country” could possibly be modified by the Canaanite h≥ores=“mountain” from the Afroasiatic root *h°oras, which is found in the Akkadian h°urs=u, the Egyptian h°Åst.46



494 BLACK ATHENA
jAsswro;n. Chapters 5 and 7 covered the shift in the city name Tyre from T(y ̆)ôr > Sô ̆r.47 The original meaning was “rock.” This provides a suitable etymology for Asso\ron, a mountain on Samos. The prothetic vowel coming from the Canaanite article *Hass`ô```r. The Sicilian city name would seem to derive from Tyre itself.48
jAtavbur(i)on. The etymology of Atabyrion from the Canaanite *Hatt`å`bôr was given in Chapter 5.49 Stephanus mentions Atabyria in Sicily, Persia and Phoenicia.50
[Ida. The derivation of Ida from the Semitic ÷yd “hand, monument” was given in Chapter 15.51
Divkth. There are two explanations for Artemis’ epithet Divktunna, one popular and the other scholarly. The popular one is from divktuon “net,” which is used for hunting and fishing and is altogether suitable for the hunter goddess. Diktyon itself is supposed to come from the supposedly ancient verb dikei`n (6) only found in the aorist, with the meaning “to hurl, throw” and no established etymology. This would seem to derive from an Egyptian biliteral *tk found in the Demotic tkÅ and the Coptic to\k qualitative te\k, “hurl, throw.” The scholarly explanation for Diktynna is that it derives from Mount Dikte– the name of which is pre-Hellenic and, therefore, inexplicable. While I believe that the popular explanation is the more plausible, it may be possible to reconcile the two. There is an obscure term dekthv, which Hesykhios glosses as clai'na, claniv" “overgarments.” In Semitic the root ÷dqt is found in the extinct Ethiopic language of Gafat as dEqwätä and the Gurage language of Soddo as däqot “belt.” This has been plausibly linked to the Amharic dEg “long body band wrapped tightly around the middle of the body” and the Arabic dikka or tikka “waistband.”52 The probability is that the forms with a final /-t/ represent the original form, in which case ÷dqt provides a plausible origin for dekte\and, in the sense of a net with a drawstring, diktyon and Diktynna. The connection with Dikte–is more difficult, the only solutions are that it came from “net” or that the Dictaean mountain range was seen as surrounding—at least from the south—the Laphistion Plain.
Kadivston. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the scholar Ernst Assmann, argued that Mount Kadiston in northern Crete came



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 495
from a Semitic form found in the Akkadian qadist=u “temple slave,” but also as an epithet of Is=tar.53 I do not believe one should be so precise but it certainly comes from the root ÷qds discussed in Chapter 14.54
Kiqai'rwn. Victor Bérard convincingly derived Mount Kythairo–n from the Semitic root ÷qt`r`Hebrew Piel verb form qi`tt`e`r “to offer burnt sacrifices.” This corresponds well with Pausanias’ description of elaborate holocausts set up on its peak.55
Lauvrion. For a derivation of lauvra from r-wÅt “the way,” see Chapter 9.56 If the modern Lavrion really was already an alternative name for what was generally known as Qoriko;" the narrow strait to the island of JElenh,vit was the infamous twentieth-century penal island of Makronisos. If, as seems more likely, it was on the west of the peninsula it would be facing the much broader mouth of the Saronic Gulf.
Lukabettov". The derivation of Lykabettos from Å∆ˆÅbtt “luminous region to the east,” written with a mountain determinative, will be discussed with other Athenian place-names in Chapter 22.57
Oi[th. Mount Oite–is part of the range that was thought to force the Persians to go through the narrow pass at Thermopylae. The Greeks were unaware of the track through the mountains that allowed the Persians to take them from the rear.58 Two hundred years later in 279 BCE Celtic invaders came the same way. As Pausanias described the topography: “There are two paths over Mount Oite–, one above Trachis mostly precipitous and terribly steep and the other through Ainianian country, easier for the passage of an army, the one by which Hydernes the Persian attacked the Greeks under Leonidas in the rear.”59 This time the path was blocked long enough for the Greeks to be able to evacuate their force at Thermopylae by sea. The Egyptian wŒrt generally means “part, province.” With a river or canal determinative, however, it could mean “branch, leg” of a river. WŒrt as a place name with a mountain determinative has been interpreted by a number of scholars: “passage in, gorge in a mountainous region.”60 Even allowing for archaism, the retention of the final -t suggests that the name was taken into Greek before it disappeared from Egyptian. The Coptic form oueret\e from the dual wŒrty indicates that the medial -r- probably disappeared within Greek.61 Despite the phonetic



496 BLACK ATHENA
uncertainty, the semantic agreement is so precise as to make this a strong etymology.
[Olumpo". Olympos was the name of a number of mountain ranges, notably the one north of Thessaly. Its derivation from wrmwt was discussed in Chapter 15.
Parnasso;", Pavrnh". The mountain name Parnassos has given much pleasure to scholars thirsting in an otherwise empty toponymic desert for demonstrations of Anatolian influences on Greece. The late Professor Leonard Palmer liked it so much that he used it to describe a “Parnassos folk” who invaded Greece from Anatolia. His etymology is from the Hittite parna “house,” which in some cases could refer to a rock dwelling. This still seems odd as the name of a mountain. Palmer argues that parna may be related to the Egyptian pr and the Hurrian purli/ purni “house” and that, therefore, it is likely to be a word indigenous to Asia Minor.62 For discussion, see Chapter 9.63 Parnassos was famous in mythology as the place where Deukalion, the Greek Noah, landed to begin the repopulation of the world. Egyptian cosmogonies began with the emergence of primeval mounds from the chaotic flood waters. Different cults honored different sites as the original mounds.64 The national shrine of Lower Egypt was called Pr Nsr; it was near the ancient cities of Pe and Dep and the later city of Buto. Egyptian Pr WÅdyt is discussed in Chapter 9.65 Pr Nsr is generally accepted as having been the capital of Lower Egypt before Unification in the Fourth Millennium and it remained a place of pilgrimage and coronation with the Red Crown throughout the millennia of dynastic Egypt. No religious inscriptions or texts have been found there so it is not usually listed among the primeval mounds but it is an excellent candidate. Its central political and religious importance in predynastic times and its geographical position, which Gardiner described as “situated almost like an island amid the watery fens of the north-western Delta,” make it an excellent contender.66 As an etymon for Parnassos, Pr Nsr presents no difficulty with its first syllable. Coptic compounds containing -po–r and the Hebrew ParŒoah indicate that *pa\r was a frequent rendition of pr before the Canaanite shift.67 Nothing is known about the vocalizing of Nsr. Even so *parnVsr provides a better phonetic fit with Parnassos than does the Hittite parna. Given the myths about Deukalion, it makes a better semantic one too. It



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 497
would also explain the name Mount Parne–s, which dominates Attica just as Parnassos does Delphi and Boiotia.
Ptwvon. James Frazer described Mount Pto–on as “a range or mass of mountains which bounds the Copaic plain on the east and extends thence north and east to the Euripus.”68 The name comes from the Egyptian pÅ dw, Coptic pto–u(B), ptou(S) “the mountain.”
Saivti". Pausanias presumably reflected conventional wisdom in claiming that Sais, Saitis stood for Athena.69 Therefore, there is little doubt that Mount Saitis was named after the goddess and her cult center.
Sapusevlaton. Pausanias reported that the old name of Mount Arachnion in the eastern Argolid was originally Sapyselaton.70 Michael Astour points out that while it makes no sense in Greek Sapyselaton fits well with “Sps ilt pronounced approximately Saps >elat or Sapas >elat, ‘Sapsu the goddess.’ It is known that the Ugaritians considered the sun not a god but a goddess, and called her not by the common Semitic word for sun, Sams, but by a specific modification Saps . . . .”71 The problems with this reasoning are the absence of such a toponym in the Levant and the lack of any trace of a sun cult on the mountain. Nevertheless, the existence of many other Semitic toponyms in the Peloponnese, together with the precision of the phonetic parallels in such a complex name, would seem to overwhelm the objections.
Sfivgx Fivga. Mount Sphinx, or its simplification Phiga, lies northwest of Thebes and southeast of the Copaic plain. The mountain was associated with Oedipus’ Sphinx. The origin of Sphinx from the Egyptian s=spw Œnh°has been discussed in earlier chapters.72
Tau?geton. The derivation of the Peloponnesian mountain range Taygetos from the Egyptian TÅ(w) igrt “land(s) of the realm of the dead” will be discussed in the next chapter.73
CONCLUSION ON MOUNTAIN NAMES. The names mentioned above make up a relatively small proportion of all the mountains in Greece. I am certain that many more can be derived from Afroasiatic. In any event, even this number is far greater than that discovered by scholars who have restricted themselves to Indo-European.



498 BLACK ATHENA
Rivers
If anything, river names are even more archaic than those of mountains. While the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of North America has the St. Lawrence, Hudson, Delaware and Rio Grande, these are countered by the Connecticut and the Susquehanna and the interior is drained by rivers with almost exclusively Native American names. Similarly, four out of the five Great Lakes have Native American names. Greece has very few substantial rivers or lakes but most of these, and many of the smaller ones, have Egyptian or Semitic names.
WORDS FOR RIVERS. Large rivers were called potamoi. The derivation of potamov" from Pr tm was proposed in Chapter 9.74 Another term used frequently for water courses in Greece was caravdra or cavradro". Its appearance in Linear B confirms that it was in use since the Bronze Age. Adolf Fick apparently felt no need to explain it, as carvadro" is the word for “winter stream, torrent.” There is a plausible Canaanite etymology for both the toponym and the word. Chantraine plausibly associates kharadros with cevrado" “silt brought down by streams.”75 A stream named Frivxo" “trembling, terror” was close to the river Kheradros in the Argolid.76 Following Victor Bérard’s principle of Semitic-Greek “doublets,” this suggests that Kharadros comes from the Canaanite h≥årad (÷hr°d) “agitated, fear and trembling.”77 This is used in the biblical toponym H≥arod, the name of a torrent made famous by the settlement Œe–yîn H≥arod. The semantic link between “terror” and a rushing stream would also seem to be present in the Latin terreo “fear” extorris and torrens “torrent” a river that rushes but dries up. Chantraine follows his predecessors in associating kharadros with caravssw (H) “sharpen, scratch.” This form is a perfect match with the Canaanite ÷hr°s`found in the Hebrew  ̇åras`“cut, sharpen” and in h≥årûs` “trench or moat,” which is ultimately related to h≥årad. Another word for winter torrent is ajvnauro" (H) for which the lexicographers find no satisfactory etymology. The common Semitic root ÷nhr found in the Hebrew nåhår “stream, river,” with the Canaanite definite article ha, seems adequate.
RIVER NAMES. jAnivgro". Anigros, the name of a small sulfurous stream in the western Peloponnese, is mentioned in the section under Iardanos below. It has a clear Semitic etymology from the root ÷ngr “spring, stream,



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 499
oasis” found in a large number of place-names in southwest Asia and northern Africa: Nagara, Nigira, Nigrai.78
jAcervrwn. Frisk and Chantraine cannot accept an Indo-European etymology for Akherro–n, a common name for rivers, the best known of which was in northwest Greece. It was also an alternative to Styx as the name for the river of death. These lexicographers, however, do not mention the etymology proposed by Lewy: that it derived from the Semitic >ah°a=rôn “behind, western sea.” This etymology would associate, as many cultures do, death with sunset. See the discussion of erebos “sunset, world of the dead” in Chapter 8.79 Astour, however, took up Lewy’s proposal and West derived it independently.80
Asw'po". Aso–pos is a common river name; one example is the largest river in southern Boiotia. Another Aso–pos meets the Sperchios above Thermopyae and a third reaches the sea near Sikyon in Akhaia. A fourth flows into the sea on the west side of the Parnon Peninsula south of Sparta. Astour derives the name from West Semitic as found in the Hebrew >åsôp “granary” and >åsap “to gather, harvest.”81 The four rivers do flow through plains. Thus, this connection does seem semantically possible. The lack of evidence of its use as a toponym in the Levant, however, somewhat weakens this etymology.
jIavrdano", jIavrdhno". Fick saw Iardanos as “Lelegian” or Lydian but cited no parallels. As mentioned above, he specifically warned against identifying it with the Canaanite Iarde–n or Iarda–n (Ieredan). Jasanoff and Nussbaum continue the tradition of denial by citing the Greek shift y>h, which is generally dated to circa 1300 BCE. To them an earlier loan into Greek would have been rendered *Hardanos.82 Even if their dubiously established date for the shift were accurate, a later introduction presents little problem. We know that Elis in the northwestern Peloponnese, the site of one Iardanos, was very much influenced from the east towards the end of the Bronze Age. In addition, eastern Crete where the other Iardanos was situated was strongly influenced by Phoenicians in the early Iron Age. The early twentieth-century classicist J. G. Frazer, author of The Golden Bough, was convinced of the Semitic etymology of Iardanos. He reinforced this derivation by pointing out that Iardanos was also the old name



500 BLACK ATHENA
for two short rivers that fed into the lagoon of Kaiapha on the coast of Elis. These rivers were later known as the Akidas and the Anigros; the Anigros stunk of volcanic gases. Frazer showed that the leprosy cure described by Pausanias in the nearby cave of the Anigrian nymphs resembled the biblical cure of the leper Haaman the Syrian in the Jordan.83
jInavco". The etymology of Inakhos, the river that drained the Argive plain, from the Egyptian Œnh°was discussed in Chapter 10.84
jItano;". Itanos was a city with plentiful Phoenician associations in eastern Crete, a region dense with Semitic place-names.85 The name is old as it appears as Itano in Linear A and Utano in Linear B. Victor Bérard saw the parallel with the Hebrew >et–ån or >êtan “perennial, everflowing.” Itanos had such a brook.86
Khfis(s)ov", Kw'pa–i>", Kafuvai, Kaiavfa. Ke–phissos, or Ke@phisos, is one of the commonest river names in Greece. Most were considered particularly pure and holy and often went underground and emerged again. Fick sees the name as “pelasgische” but offers no explanation.87 An etymology from the Egyptian roots ÷qbb “cool” and ÷qbh≥ “purify,” found in hydronyms, was proposed in Volume 2. Another attested Egyp
tian toponym Qbh≥w, written with the determinatives L (G42) and k (G39), was used as a place-name for ponds or lakes with aquatic birds. Three examples of the latter can be found in Greek hydronomy: Kaphyai a is a lake in Arkadia fed by mysterious springs.88 Kaiapha is now a lagoon on the exposed west coast of the Peloponnese but in antiquity it appears to have been a marsh fed by a river Anigros.89 By far the best known, however, was the lake or marsh named Ko–pa–is, a large shallow lake in Boiotia. It was drained in the Bronze Age and again in the nineteenth century CE. A river Ke–phisos flowed into it. The alternation e–/oin Ke–phissos/Ko–pais is similar to that of se\ma and so\ma discussed in Chapter 5.90 Jasanoff and Nussbaum contest the latter etymology on the grounds that Ko–pais is the name of the town on the lakeshore and the body of water gets its name from the town.91 They agree that Ko–pa–is limne– is “conventionally glossed” “Copaean Lake,” but, according to them, it really means “lake near Copae.” They have no idea of the meaning of Copae. This argument seems to me to be absurd niggling. The names of lakes and the towns set on their shores are frequently confused, for



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 501
example, Erie, Windermere and Geneva. Given the parallel lake names Kaphyai and Kaiapha, there is no reason to reject an obvious origin from the Egyptian Qbh≥.
Lavdwn, Qevlpousa, Tevlfousa, Tritw'n. The parallel tangles of these toponyms in Boiotia and Arkadia were set out in Volume 2.92 Jasanoff and Nussbaum often dismiss my proposals by simply stating that a proposed etymology “might as well mean” without providing any serious alternative. For instance, they claim that the names Telphousa and Thelpousa for cataracts or springs in Boiotia and Arkadia might as well mean “‘Cataract,’ ‘Travelers Rest’ or any of a thousand other possibilities.”93 My phonetically plausible etymology from the attested Egyptian place-name TÅlbyw “Libya,” has several bases. It is based not merely, as they say, on the fact that Libya contains cliffs, cataracts and oases, but also on strong mythological and toponymic parallels of the Greek placenames with Libya. There are the role of the tumultuous god Poseidon and the hydronym Trito–n that is associated with him; these are found both as the name of a lake in Libya and as a stream flowing from Telphousa. Near the Libyan Trito–n was a river Latho–n or Le–ton. The Arkadian Thelpousa was sited on a river Lado\n. Lado\n was also an alternative name for the river Ismenos that flowed past Thebes in Boiotia. In Volume 2, I give many other mythological and toponymic parallels between Libya and these areas of Boiotia and Arkadia.94
Maiavndro". This Greek name of a Carian river occurs in Homer.95 Famous for its winding course, the river gives us both the Latin and English words “meander.” Phonetically the stem would seem to be related to mai`a “old woman, midwife” and to mai- which is the base of many words concerning the physical aspect of birth. Given the ancient association of the womb with the emotions, the latter may also form part of the root of maivnomai (H) mania/ (H) and reduplicated maima—vw (H). This root covers the semantic areas of “rage” and “madness.” Pokorny, Frisk and Chantraine want to set these within the Indo-European cluster *men “think,” although Chantraine does see some semantic distance.96 A Semitic origin is much more plausible in biblical Hebrew where me\Œyîm, construct mEŒy, generally means “bowels, intestines.” In some instances, however, the form refers to the “womb, source of procreation.” It is also used figuratively as the seat of emotions; usually compassion in Hebrew but in Ge'ez and other Ethiopic languages mäŒat means “to rage,



502 BLACK ATHENA
be angry.”97 These forms with and without the plural suffix -ayim, would seem to provide plausible etymologies for the whole of the Greek cluster. In the latter language, however, the predominant sense is female. Thus, it would be necessary to specify when a speaker wanted to refer to the only meŒa/maia possessed by men. This need might explain the suffix -andros “of a man” attached to the stem. In any event, the toponyms Maiandros/Meander find a plausible etymology in “intestine river.” Analogies for this exist in, first, the Egyptian word qÅb “intestine” writ
ten with determinative `π (F.47). The word in the plural, qÅbw, with the same determinative was used for the “windings of a waterway.” The second analogy is with the Chinese ga\ng “large intestine” and ga=ng “creek or natural harbor,” as in Xiangga#ng “fragrant harbor,” otherwise known as Hong Kong.
Pamivsso". John Chadwick persuasively linked the Mycenaean river name Qamisijo to the Pamissos River in Messenia. In fact, this name was given to several small rivers. Fick merely stated without explanation that Pamisos is from Asia Minor.98 In Egypt the lesser distributaries of the Nile are called Pa-mw “the water of. . . .”99 These would seem to be explicable as Pa-mw with the suffix -is(s)os. For a long discussion in which I argue that in the fourteenth century the sign written qa was pronounced pa, see Chapter 9.100
Phneiov", Feneov". The derivation of these lake names was mentioned in Chapter 9 and discussed in Volume 2.101
Stuvx. Styx is not an earthly river but an infernal one. It is clearly connected to stugevw “to hate, abhor” and stugnov" “hateful, gloomy.” Pokorny, Frisk and Chantraine want to relate it to Slav roots found in the Russian stygnuti “cold.” Though fine phonetically, this connection is not good semantically. Although Odysseus’ Hades is cloud-covered and misty, there is no suggestion that anyone there feels cold.102 The Egyptian stkn “to cause to approach, induct, bring on doom” seems more appropriate.
CONCLUSION ON RIVERS NAMES. Greece has relatively few river names, and a high proportion of those that exist have Egyptian or Semitic names. This picture is very different from the patterns in England, where most of the river names are Celtic or pre-Celtic, and in English-speaking North America, where a high proportion are of Native American origin.



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 503
Although too much should not be made of this particular aspect, it does indicate the very high degree of Egyptian and West Semitic linguistic and cultic influence upon Greece.
CITY NAMES
The names of human settlements are generally, but not always, more susceptible to change than those of natural phenomena. It is not surprising, therefore, that relatively few city names can be traced back to an Indo-European, let alone an Indo-Hittite, substrate, and most of the major names have reasonable or strong Afroasiatic etymologies. As an example, one characteristic found in the names of many major cities is that they appear to have the plural suffix -ai or -oi.103 In fact, this feature derives from the Canaanite dual suffix -áyîm, construct-ê, frequently used for cities. The late Cyrus Gordon showed that in Bronze Age Canaan the duality of cities was important and he plausibly associated this duality with the double nature of the acropolis and the lower town, a feature that was found around the eastern Mediterranean at that time. Hence such names as Qiryåtayîm “double city” and Mah≥a=nayîm “double camp,” discussed below, are frequently attested in the Bible.104 A Greek calque for this sense of duality is evident in the frequent use of the prefix jAmfi“both, two” in city names.105
Aqh'nvi. This toponym was not restricted to the capital of Attika; as mentioned in Volume 2, other cities of the same name were sited in Boiotia and elsewhere.106 Athens will be treated at length in the last chapter.
[Argo". This city name is not a loan from Afroasiatic but a calque from Egyptian. As I pointed out in Volume 1, argos means “brilliant white” while ˆnb  ̇d “silver walls” was a frequent name for Memphis.107
Delfoi;. Delphi and its derivation from a Semitic *qwElf were discussed in the last chapter.108
Drero". The city of Dre–ros was situated in far eastern Crete on the slopes of Qadiston, mentioned above. Therefore, Astour’s suggestion that it had a Semitic etymology seems very plausible. He pointed out that in Hebrew dErôr means “free” and that in Mesopotamia there was a city



504 BLACK ATHENA
Durâru “freetown” near Larsa, with that meaning. One called Eleuthernai also existed in western Crete.109
JErmiw;n, JErmiovnh. For the derivation of this city name from the Canaanite toponym H≥ermôn see the next chapter.110
Qevspeia, Qivsbh. The derivation of these two Boiotian city names from the Hurrian thunder god Tes=s=ub and their association with Tes=s=ub’s Greek counterpart Herakles were discussed in Volume 1.111
Qhvbai. Stephanus listed nine Thebes: in Thessaly, in Cilicia, in the Troad, near Miletos, in Attika, in Kataonia in central Anatolia, in Italy and in Syria.112 It simply meant “palace, seat of a monarch, capital.” By far the best known, of course, were those in Egypt and Boiotia. In Volume 2, I set out the toponym’s etymology from a confusion of two Egyptian roots, tbi and dbt “box, chest” and dbÅt “coffin, shrine” and, hence, “palace” DbÅ, Coptic Tbo–(S) or Thbo–(B), was the secular name for the major city Bh≥d(t), the later Edfu.113 There was undoubtedly a palace at the Hyksos capital of Avaris, and the possibility that it was referred to as DbÅ is increased by the modern name Tel ed DabŒa. If Greeks had referred to Avaris, the capital of Egypt during the Hyksos period, as *Teba, this would explain the puzzle of why, when the capital was moved south with the triumph of the Eighteenth Dynasty, they called it “Thebai,” even though the name was never used for that city by Egyptians themselves. The situation has been confused by Greek myths playing on the Canaanite stories of têbåh in the sense of “ark.” Astour has shown intricate parallels between legends about the foundation of Thebes with the wanderings of unyoked heifers and stories of the movement of the Israelite ark.114 Jasanoff and Nussbaum write that Bernal, “tacitly assumes the identity of the name Thebes, with the barely attested Greek noun thîbis ‘basket’ was ‘generally accepted’ before the advent of the Aryan Model.”115 In fact, all that I “assume” is that both the word thîbis and the toponym The\bai come directly or indirectly from dbÅt and dbt. Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s major objection to this etymology is that the city name was written Teqa in Linear B.116 I have made the argument in Chapter 5 that qa was read as pa in late Mycenaean times.117 I have admitted, however, that this case could cause problems because the city name may have been introduced rather earlier than pasiyara/ basileus.118



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 505
Kavrua, Karuavtide", Kovrinqo". A widespread cluster of toponyms includes such variants as Kavria, Kavrua, Karuvai, Garuvai, Kariovte", Karqaiva, kovrtu" Govrtun and Gorivto". As the terms Karo, Keretewo and Korito found in Linear B have been identified as place-names it is certain that at least some of them date from the Bronze Age. Chadwick plausibly sees Korito as the classical Korinthos, although not the famous city on the isthmus.119 This raises the possibility that Korinthos and Ke–rinthos in Euboia both came from a nasal dissimilation before a dental. Parallels exist in the pairs of names Athe–ne–, Anthe–ne–, and Didymos, Dindymos.120 Thus Corinth too may belong to the Karia group. It has been argued that Karia and Karua cannot be from the same stem because in the Second Millennium, unlike classical times, the Greek /u/ was a back vowel and could not be confused with an /i/.121 As Ventris and Chadwick noted, however: “Confusion of i=and u=is not only found in the koinh,vbut also in pre-Greek words and names.”122 No doubt the gradual shift from /u/ to /y/ in Canaanite during the Second Millennium indicates that the distinction was not clear in that language. The development w>y is well known in the initial position.123 There was also considerable confusion between the two glides or semivowels in the medial position. As Paul Joüon wrote in his authoritative grammar of Hebrew: “The two vocalic consonants u√ and i√ being analogous, it is easy to move from the one to the other.”124 Various traditions have explained these place-names. Some writers linked the Karias to the Carians, probably resulting in the general belief in classical antiquity that there had been a Carian “thalassocracy” or maritime empire. Carians in the fifth century BCE denied the truth of this.125 Furthermore, despite Thucydides’ report of Carian burials on Delos, no archaeological trace of these people can be found in the western Aegean.126 Considering its proximity, Caria was relatively unimportant in Greek mythology and none of the founding heroes were supposed to have come from there. Another explanation was that many of the Karias may have been names after a king Kar. Most notable of these places was the acropolis of Megara, which was called Kar(i)a.127 A slightly less implausible explanation is that the Karyai were named from the Greek karya “nut tree.” No doubt a few Greek place-names do come from trees. However, karya does not explain the other variants, nor, given the slight importance of nut trees in Mediterranean mythology, does it explain the toponym’s extraordinary frequency.



506 BLACK ATHENA
A much more plausible etymology is Semitic: qry, also written qryt, meant “city” in Canaanite. This would seem to derive from a Semitic root qw/yar(y) which may be attested in the Amharic qwäräqqwärä “found a city” and the Gunnan Gurage qwE:rqwE:r “pen, fence in meadow.” The original sense may have been “to bolt two pieces of wood together,” see the (Soddo) Gurage qE:räqärä “to lock the door with a bar.” Hebrew has the words qôråh “fitting beams,” qåråh “to lay beams” and qîr “wall.” In Arabic qarra (qarartu or qariutu) is “to settle or establish residence.” With such a phonetically complex root it is not surprising that the Canaanite qryt should have a wide range of vocalizations. In the Masoretic text one finds qiryat, qeret and qarttåh. In the Septuagint the city names are usually transcribed Kariat(h) or Karith.128 Greek and Roman renderings of such Phoenician names nearly all give /a/ as the first vowel. For instance in Punic southeastern Spain twelve ancient toponyms began with Cartand four with Car-. In the eastern Mediterranean place-names with this root (like many others) were often found in the dual, for the reason set out in the introduction to this section. A city near Sidon presumably named *Qrtm in Phoenician was rendered Qar-ti-im-me in Assyrian.129 In the Bible there is a city in Moab called Qiryåtayîm, (Kariathaim in the Septuagint) and another in Napthali, which was also known as Qarttån.130 The city names Kortyn and Gortyn could well come from Qrtym. In some cases, the final -n, -ne or -na could come from an Egypto-Canaanite doublet: the Egyptian niwt “city” was written ne in Coptic and ni in Assyrian texts.131 This doublet could explain the city names Kerneia, Gerenea and Korone.\ Such an explanation would at least be more plausible than the common etymology from geranos “crane” or koron–e–, “sheer water.” Beyond the inherently greater likelihood that such common city names should mean “town” rather than “Carian,” “nut tree” or “sea bird,” several pieces of evidence link Kari/ya(t) to polis. The chief city on the island of Keos was known alternatively as Karthaia—a name that appeared in Punic Spain—or Poleis. Also, as mentioned above, at Megara the acropolis was called Karia, while at Athens the cultural height was simply referred to as Polis.132 The stem Kari/yat may also have been used for binames for some Greek gods. In two Peloponnesian cities—not called Karyai—Apollo was known as Kereatas and Koruntheos.133 Artemis was named Karyatis and Herodotos referred to an old Athenian family sacrificing to Zeus Karios.134



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 507
These could stand for Carian or be related to the root Keras, Keratias “horned.” It would seem equally, or more, likely that they were parallel to the ancient epicleses Polia, Poliatis and Polieus and could best be explained as meaning “of the city.” The most striking example of the parallel between Kari/ya and Polis comes from Athens. In the Erekhtheon, the southwestern porch of the city’s most sacred temple of Athena Polias, six figures of the Karyatides surrounded the tomb of the legendary Kekrops. The earliest attestation of the name Karyatides is in the works of Vitruvius from the first century BCE. Given the sanctity of the site and the proverbial religious conservatism of the Athenians, however, there is no reason to doubt that the statues’ names, like those of similar figures at Delphi, were much more ancient.135 Were these “nut fairies” or priestesses of Artemis from Karyai in Lakonia? It would seem far more plausible to suppose that the figures around the tomb of the city’s founder should be called children (the derivation of the Greek suffix -ides “child of ” from the Egyptian id “child” was described in Chapter 9) or spirits of the city.136 As such, Karyatides would be entirely appropriate in the temple of Athene–Polias.
Lavrissa. In Volume 1, I refer to “many” Laris(s)ai.137 Stephanos names ten.138 Homer applied the epithet eribol\ax “deep-soiled, fertile” to two of them. Strabo, cited by K. O. Müller, maintained that all Larissai were on alluvial soil.139 Jasanoff and Nussbaum challenged the two ancients and me and claimed that the second Thessalian Larisa (Kremaste)\ does not fit this pattern as it was situated “high on a mountainside.”140 According to Pausanias, however, it was “by the sea.”141 It was almost certainly on slopes overlooking a small coastal plain. Larisa is a city name and, as such, it was associated with walls and heights, most strikingly as the name of the acropolis at Argos, which dominated the fertile Argive plain. For this reason, not because of any association with mountain ranges, Stephanos wrote that Larissa originally meant “citadel”; combined with Strabo’s judgment this would mean a mound over flat fertile land. From inscriptional evidence Professor Bietak, the excavator of Tel Ed Dab’a, has identified the name R-Åh≥t “entry into the fertile lands” with the Hyksos capital Avaris.142 Jasanoff and Nussbaum do not challenge the phonetics of the etymology, but in any event these are good. Vocalizations of R- as la- were given in Chapter 9.143 The disappearance



508 BLACK ATHENA
of initial and medial /h≥/ is extremely frequent in transcriptions and acknowledged loans and final -t in Egyptian is often rendered as -is in Greek (see irt/Iris, St/Isis). The semantic match is excellent. R-Åh≥t as the name of the Hyksos capital set in the Nile Delta corresponds neatly with Larisa, the acropolis of Argos, the city of Danaos with special cult associations with Aigyptos and overlooking one of the most fruitful plains of the Peloponnese.144 The northern section of the largest plain on the peninsula, on the boundary between Elis and Akhaia, which brought the Nile Delta to Pausanias’ mind was drained by a river Larisos.145 According to Xenophon, the Larisa in Anatolian Ionia was also called Aigyptia.146 Above the swampy seaside plain near Gythion in southern Laconia was a sacred Mount Larysion.147 In eastern Crete, the city later known as Hieraptna was called Larisa and dominated the Larisian Plain.148 According to Stephanus of Byzantium, Larisa was an old name for Gortyn, the acropolis of which is a hill in the middle of the Mesara, the largest plain on the island.149 The inland Larisa in Thessaly was a stronghold in the heart of a great and marshy plain. The Larisai in western Anatolia appear to have had similar situations.150 It is striking how many of the Larisai were set in regions that archaeological finds indicate were densely populated in Mycenaean times.151 Legendary evidence is still more clear-cut. The name “entry into the fertile lands” fits perfectly with the position of Larisa on the Peneus in central Thessaly.
Mantineva. In Demotic, mÅŒ has a special signification of “place” in addition to its meanings of “right, truth” etc. From mÅŒ n “place of ” one finds in Coptic the toponymic prefix Man-.152 Therefore, it would seem permissible to postulate a mÅŒ n tÅ niwt, later Man tE ne/e–“place of the town.” It should be noted that the original accent Mantinéa corresponds to an emphasis on -ne “town.” The later Mantínea reflects the normal pattern of recessive accents, when the original Egyptian sound had been lost. According to a number of ancient writers, the district around Mantineia was inhabited by four or five townships.153 The center of the confederacy, the later city of Mantineia on a hillock was called Ptovli" “city.”154 Thus Mantineia/Ptolis makes a good Egypto-Hellenic doublet. The late (on the Egyptian timescale) form of the Egyptian etymon, however, suggests that it was only introduced during the Early Iron Age during the same period that many Egyptian terms were adopted in Laconia.155



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 509
Mevgara. The common Greek toponym Megara or Meara came, as Pausanias suggested, from the word megara in the sense of “cave, subterranean chamber.”156 For the last three centuries many scholars have linked this word to the Hebrew mEŒåråh “cave.”157 The West Semitic word with this meaning occurs in the Ugaritic place-name Mg!rt.158 The Greek toponymic variants Megara and Meara suggest that the first was borrowed before, and the second after, the West Semitic g!ain had merged with Œain around the middle of the Second Millennium.159 Another example of an early transcription of g! as g comes in the city name called  ́Gazzeh in Arabic, Gdt in Egyptian and Gaza in Greek but Cazzah in later Canaanite. Such early datings for the Greek names Megara and Gaza would parallel those of Byblos and Tyre, which can be shown on phonetic grounds to have been standardized before 1400 BCE.160
Mevqana, Meqwvnh, Moqwvnh. In a brilliant study, Alan Lloyd has showed that a description by Strabo of fights between bulls in a dromos by the temples of Apis and Hephaistos in Memphis was from an Egyptian tradition going back to the Old Kingdom or beyond. It appears to have symbolized the conflict between Horus and Seth.161 Translation of dromos into English is difficult. It can refer not only to an avenue or a race course but also to a circular space or the orchestra of a theater. The earliest attested, and most common, Egyptian term for the site of a tauromachy is mtwn, which has as its determinatives either “bull” or “land.”162 Mtwn is clearly derived from twn “gore, pierce” with the locative prefix m-. In Homer movqo", accusative mothon, means “din of battle.” According to Liddell and Scott, however, it is “generally a fight between animals.” In 1955, Professor Stricker showed the striking parallels between early Greek theater and Egyptian rituals and dramatic tradition.163 Evidence from the Greek side would seem to indicate that either in Egypt or in Greece the meaning of mtwn was extended from animal fights to theater in general. Possibly this semantic shift was influenced by the Canaanite mådôn “strife and contention” coming from the root dyn “judge.” The Greek forms closely resemble the Egyptian ones in both phonetics and semantics. The Greek motho\n could mean “a licentious dance, a flute tune, presumptious impudent fellow.” Plutarch reported that the Spartans forced the Helots to drink and “ordered them to sing songs and dance dances that were low and ridiculous.”164 Mtwn was a common Egyptian place-name, which possibly survives in the toponym Me(i)dum.165 The names Motho\ne, Metho\ne or Methana



510 BLACK ATHENA
were almost equally frequent in Greece. Methana in the Argolid was set on the coast of a spectacular gulf that could well be seen as a theater. The same is true, on a much larger scale, for the Methana in Thessaly. Pausanias describes the Motho–ne in Messenia as follows: “my view is that the place got its name from the rock Mothon, which is also what creates the harbour there: it runs beneath the surface leaving a narrow entrance for ships and makes a barrier against deep sea waves.”166 Thus this location too could be seen as a theater. There is no doubt that the names of these cities are the same. While spelling may vary in each case, the facts that the Isis worshipped at Methana in the Argolid appeared on the coins of Motho–ne and that the Artemis worshipped at Motho\ne appeared on coins of Methana show that—at least in later times—the citizens believed they were connected. The most striking evidence from numismatics comes, however, from a coin from Motho–ne. Frazer describes it: “The harbour of Motho–ne is represented in the shape of a theater.”167 This coin ties the name semantically to Mtwn.
Mukh'nai. The traditional etymology for the great Late Bronze Age city Mycenae is from mykos “mushroom,” which in the extended sense of “knob” is still sometimes accepted. Fick merely wrote that Mycenae might be placed with Mykale–and Mykale–ssos, which he saw as Carian.168 They could indeed be related to the extent that they all might well begin with the Afroasiatic locative prefix m-. In the 1890s, Muss-Arnolt proposed a derivation from mEkônåh, an attested feminine form of makôn “place, settlement” in many Semitic languages.169 A more plausible candidate would seem to be mh°n, mah≥a=neh in Hebrew “camp.” In both the singular and dual forms mh°nm, mah≥a=nayîm “double camp.” This form is a common place-name in Ugaritic and Hebrew. Jasanoff and Nussbaum do not refer to the etymology from mykos and provide no alternative. They simply attack the proposal that it derives from *mah°a=nayîm.
But more to the point is Bernal’s failure—or refusal—to notice that the ending –e–nai/-e–ne–older (<older -a–nai/-a–na–) is a recurring element in Greek place names. No credence can be attached to an analysis of “Mycenae” which separates the termination -e–nai/ -e–ne– from the corresponding -a–nai/-a–na– of names like Messa–vna–v “Messene” and Kura–vna–v“Cyrene.”170
While I am aware of the endings -e\nai etc., I do not think that these prefixes can be separated from a wider class of Greek city names: those



[CH. 20] GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES AND PLACE-NAMES 511
ending -ai or -oi, as discussed in the introduction to this section. City names with -e–nai are simply those in which the stem has a final -n. The name *Mah°a=nayîm also fits the city’s military connotations and the fact that it was situated above and beyond the Argive Plain with its older cities Argos, Tiryns and Lerna makes for an excellent semantic match. The etymology is certainly competitively plausible, especially when the only competition comes from a mushroom!
Puvlo". The argument that the city name Pylos derives from the Egyptian pr or pr ŒÅ was made in Chapter 9.171
Sikuwvn. Rather than coming from sikuwvn “field of cucumbers” Sikyo–n would seem to be from the Canaanite *sikun(åh) attested in later Hebrew as “settlement, quarter.” Chantraine notes that the uncertainty between i and e in sikuwvn and the variation sekuwvn indicates a borrowing.
Spavrta. The derivation of the name Sparta from the Egyptian spÅt “district” will be set out in the next chapter.
Troizhvn. In Chapter 22, there is a discussion of the origin of the name Troize@n in TÅ sÅn(t), the later Esna in Upper Egypt.172
Ywfiv", Yafiv". The city name Pso–phis occurs in Arkadia and on the island of Zakynthos. There is also a Psaphis in Attika. These seem to have come from the common Egyptian toponym PÅ sbt(y) “the wall, the fort.” The vocalization was uncertain in both countries. The word was attested in Coptic as sobt and the name with an article as Psabet.173
CONCLUSION
As is true with all the sections of this chapter, this one on city names provides only a sample of the huge number of Greek toponyms with more or less plausible Afroasiatic origins that could be teased out by more assiduous an expert student of the eastern Mediterranean than I. Nevertheless, I hope that this selection sufficiently indicates the riches to be found in that pursuit.

INTRODUCTION
I
n this chapter, I shall range widely on the strong Afroasiatic connections of what has generally been seen as the most “Aryan” of the Greek states. The first section deals with the derivation of the name Sparta from the Egyptian spÅt “nome, district” and the district’s capital. The second is concerned with the Egyptian jackal god Anubis “Lord of SpÅ,” guide for the dead, and his Greek counterpart Hermes. The chapter continues with a consideration of the meanings of the names Lako–n and Lakedaimo–n as “howler, biter” and “howling biting spirit” and with the importance of canines in Spartan tradition. Lakedaimo–n is explained as a calque of *KÅ >Inpw “Ka or spirit of Anubis” rendered Kano–pos in Greek. A short study of the derivation of the name Hermes from the complicated semantics of the Semitic root ÷h≥rm follows. In a section devoted to the cult at Amyklai I argue that, rather than the festival of Hyakinthia gaining its name from a mythical hero Hyakinthos, the hero gained his name from the festival. Furthermore, I argue that Hyakinthia was a rendition of the Egyptian festival of death and rebirth WÅg in a form I postulate as *WÅg ntr “sacred WÅg.” I then discuss linguistic evidence that the failure to pronounce the /Å/ as /r/ or /l/ in this case suggests a wider pattern indicating that much of the



[CH. 21] SPARTA 513
special Lako\nian vocabulary with plausible Egyptian etymologies was borrowed late—some perhaps even as late as reforms of Lykourgos around 800 BCE. The last sections consider the likelihood that Sparta had a special cult of death and, finally, the contacts between the Spartan King Areios I and the Jewish High Priest Onias.
SPARTA: *SPER AND SPÅT
August Fick provided no Indo-European etymology for the toponym Sparta. He merely called it “doubtfully Lelegian.”1 The name could be derived from the root *sper “to sow,” an extremely productive root in Greek. Sparta could then mean “sown land.” Such an etymology would fit the legend of Kadmos’ having sown dragon’s teeth at Thebes to grow Spartoiv“warriors.” Indo-Europeanists have deemed this explanation improbable and not accepted it. In an extended sense, however, I believe that this version might be correct. Two related roots, *per, *por “to separate, divide” and *pir, *per “to bring forth, bear fruit” are both found throughout Nostratic.2 In Afroasiatic many verbs have been prefixed by a causative s-. Thus, in Canaanite, for instance, one finds the biblical name Sipråh given to a midwife, someone who causes birth.3 There is also the word sapar “beautiful,” used of brides and fruitful plains. The Greek words speivrw “sow,” spevrma “seed” and spovra “sowing” etc. could possibly be derived from this Canaanite root. It would seem more likely that, as Hermann Möller suggested in 1911, and Carleton Hodge revived more recently, the so-called “s-mobile” is in Indo-European—as in Afroasiatic—a causative usually, but not always, prefixed to the root. That is to say it is Nostratic.4 The s-mobile explains some English words, such as spill “make fall,” split “cause to part,” stir “turn” and swirl “whirl.”5 Both the root ÷pr and the causative s- existed in Egyptian. There are the words prt “fruit,” prˆ “go, come out, burst forth,” spr “arrive, reach,” spri “expel.” Similarly pÅ “fly” parallels spÅw “birds made to fly.” In a semantically derived sense—resembling the Latin pars/partis and separ“separate”—one finds the Egyptian spÅt “district, nome” apparently coming from a meaning “section, division.” Whether or not one derives spÅt from *s+pr, SpÅt is by far the most plausible etymon for Sparta. In many sophisticated societies, the line between a territorial division and its capital or center of administration is difficult to draw. In China a xian is both the county and the county



514 BLACK ATHENA
seat, a similar ambiguity surrounds the Arabic medina. In Ancient Egypt SpÅt was a common place-name and place-name element for nomes or districts and towns.6 It was also used by Egyptians abroad. For instance, in the Twelfth Dynasty, the district or city of Shechem was named SpÅt.7 The town name Qiryat Sêpêr also may have meant “district town” in Canaanite and Egyptian rather than “town of the scribes” as described in the Septuagint. Yoël Arbeitman has pointed out that qiryat had the same double meaning as medinat.8 The spartoi at Thebes, mentioned above, simply took their name from the Egyptian spÅtyw “nomesmen.” The picturesque legend of “sowing the dragon’s teeth” was an attempt to explain the name by linking it to the root *sper.
SpÅt and Sardis
It is also probable that spÅt was used in Anatolia. The Persian name for the Lydian capital—called Sardis by the Greeks—was Sparda or Saparda. The second may be closer to the original Egyptian, which tended not to tolerate initial double consonants. In Aramaic the city was called Sprd. The Lydians themselves wrote Sfard or Suard, from which, presumably, the Greek Sardis derives.9 As both the Egyptian and Anatolian languages largely neutralized the voicing of their stops during or before the Second Millennium BCE, there is no problem in equating the final -t of SpÅt with the -d in Sparda and Sfard. In Cadmean Letters I argued that the Lydian and Etruscan letter 8 transcribed as an /f/ was originally a /w / or long /o–/. If this is so, it cannot have represented a /p/. I also maintain that Lydian spelling conventions were established in the Late Bronze Age.10 Thus, although originally *Spart, the Lydian pronunciation would have been Sfard or Suard by that period.11 This case would also be strengthened if, as some scholars have maintained, Sardis and Sardinia were connected in some way. Such a hypothesis is backed by evidence of eastern Mediterranean culture on Sardinia at the end of the Second Millennium.12 If, furthermore—as most scholars accept—Sardinia and the Sea Peoples, called Írdn in Egyptian and Sirdanu in Akkadian are also connected, a labial is unlikely in the name in the fourteenth century when the people were first mentioned.13 The view that the Írdn came from Sardis and then colonized Sardinia is attractive, especially as no Lydians are mentioned among the Sea Peoples. On the other hand, a powerful case has been made for the



[CH. 21] SPARTA 515
Trs,= Trojans/Etruscans, coming from Lydia and Gardiner and Astour have made reasoned arguments for the Írdn deriving from eastern Anatolia or the Caucasus.14 Even without this connection, Sardis was probably pronounced *Suard in the Late Bronze Age. On the other hand, although the name has not so far been found on Hittite documents, the Persian Sparda was likely inherited from earlier cuneiform spellings. Furthermore, although the Aramaic writing could be read as Sfrd, the word seems to come from an earlier form, Sprd.15 In this case, a loan from SpÅt would be possible but it would have to have been made before the second half of the Second Millennium BCE when /Å/ generally lost its liquid quality. I have made arguments in favor of Egyptian influence in northwest Anatolia at this time in chapters 9 and 10.16 Another indication that the name Sardis was derived from SpÅt comes from the Etruscan word for “city” spur. We know that the Etruscans copied from Greek and there is every reason to suppose that they also took from Egyptian. The borrowing could have happened during the Bronze Age in Anatolia, during the invasions of the Sea Peoples, in Italy during the Iron Age or during any two of these periods or all three. Two other institutional terms from the very scantily known Etruscan vocabulary appear to have Egyptian etymologies. The first is zil “magistrate,” apparently from sr “ magistrate” for which we can plausibly reconstruct a Second Millennium vocalization *sy(a)1.17 Next, according to the Italian Etruscologist Massimo Pallotino, the Etruscan word mech is a “political or institutional concept probably populus.”18 Mech would seem to be derived from the Egyptian ms= “troop of soldiers, gang of workmen” which later became the Demotic msj= and Coptic me\e\s=e “people, multitude, army.” The loan to mech would have been very early because the Egyp
tian sign ß (N37) conventionally transcribed s=was originally pronounced
/h°/ but seems to have shifted to s=during the Third Millennium.19 The final dental is absent in spur, as it is in the Egyptian variant spÅ and the Lydian case ending -sfar(l). The vocalization presents a greater problem. The Etruscan u stands for o and we know that after about 1400 BCE the Egyptian a often shifted to o. By this time, however, /Å/ had nearly always lost its consonantal force. Despite the general meaning of SpÅt and its possible ramifications throughout the Mediterranean, it is possible to be more specific about the Sparta in Lakonia.



516 BLACK ATHENA
ANUBIS, HERMES AND SPARTA
Like all Egyptian gods, Anubis had many binames, among which one of the more common, attested since the Old Kingdom, was “lord of SpÅ” or Sepa.20 The early twentieth-century Egyptologist, Hermann Kees plausibly claimed that Sepa was linked to a specific place-name SpÅ or Sˆpt near TÅr Åw just north of Memphis. This and the use of the determina
tive for irrigated land, ``" (N24), for spÅt “nome” strongly suggest that
SpÅ/Sepa was related to SpÅt, which raises the problem of whether the Sepa had a final -t.21 To my knowledge the final -t is indicated in only two cases. The first is the form SpÅti(?) found in an inscription from the Herakleopolitan period just before the beginning of the Middle Kingdom.22 The second is the Sipt written in the Onomastikon of Amenope from the Twentieth Dynasty.23 Despite the absence of a -t in the many other attestations, the phonetic could have been contained in the determinative on the principle of economy. Both Sepa and SpÅt were frequently written without an /Å /and sometimes even without /s/and /p/. Given the plausibility of the etymology from SpÅt, a postulated title Anubis, Lord of SpÅt, would seem possible, if there is supporting evidence. In the Egyptian tradition of religious punning, Anubis was also asso
ciated with spÅ o (L5) “milli-centipede” [a creature in sections] and
possibly with spÅ “let fly,” used in the Pyramid Texts to signify “the sending of the pharaoh’s soul to heaven.”24 In the Coffin Texts one finds the statement, “I am the centipede” on the day of the centipede.25 With this general background SpÅ(t) was sometimes considered an independent god “lord of the insects.” Usually, however, he was associated with Anubis in the embalming ritual.26 On the other hand, the spÅt determinative with a checkerboard of fields and canals associated SpÅ(t) with districts and irrigation and, hence, with Osiris. Thus, Kees saw a relationship between SpÅ(t), Anubis and Osiris.27 The names A-no-po, Ra-ke-da-no and Si-pa-ta-no found on Linear B tablets from Pylos suggest, though by no means prove, that Anubis>Inpw in Egyptian—Lakedaimo–n and possibly Spartan were names known in Bronze Age Messenia.28 For the last two and a half millennia there have been speculations as to why Spartans should also have been called Lakonians or Lakedaimonians. To examine this question it would seem helpful to look at a traditional story about Sparta recorded in Plutarch’s essay on Lykurgos: “The boys make such a cult of their stealing that one of them, as the story goes, who was carrying under his cloak



[CH. 21] SPARTA 517
a young fox [skuvmnon, whelp, young of animals] which he had stolen, suffered the animal to tear out his bowels with its teeth and claws and died rather than have his theft detected.”29 This story is extremely rich mythologically. The attitude to theft indicates the cult of Hermes, god of thieves, whose special connection to Sparta will be argued further below. The tearing out of bowels might also be a distant reflection of mummification over which Anubis presided. “Suffered . . . to tear out” is a translation of sparassovmeno", passive participle of the verb sparavssw. This form may, like speiro\, derive from a causative /s/ before the Indo-European root *par “causing to part.” Pokorny cites the Old Icelandic spior “rag, torn strip of cloth.”30 The choice of sparasso\fits both with the phonetics of SpÅ(t) and the semantics of Anubis and jackals. According to Liddell and Scott, sparagma means “piece, shred or fragment” but specifically “mangled corpses.”31 According to them sparasso\means “tear, rend esp. of dogs carnivorous animals and the like.” They go on to cite a sentence in which flesh is torn from bones. These connotations of the root spar tie in well with the most plausible etymology for the names Lakon–and Lakedaimon–: the verbs lakizo l–asko,stem lak-, with a wide semantic range but a focus on three themeshowl, rend and crack bones. These canine associations were clearly seen in antiquity. Thus Lakon–could be explained as “howler, render, bone cracker” while Lakedaimo–n would be “howling spirit.”32 Jasanoff and Nussbaum have three objections to this etymology. First, they state that Greek compounds consisting of a verb and a noun are always adjectives. Even if one accepts this assertion, the attested adjectives lakedaimo–nos and lakedaimo–nios could have formed before the noun Lakedaimo–n. Similarly, their objection that the second element, -daimo–n, had to be the object as opposed to the subject of the verb is another example of misplaced precision. As the authoritative grammarian of Greek H. W. Smyth wrote, “the Greeks did not think of any actual case relation as existing in these compounds, and the case relation that exists is purely logical.”33 Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s third, and major, objection is to the segmentation Lake-daimo–n. They argue that “the Mycenaean personal name ra-ke-da-no . . . is almost surely to be read as Laked-a–no–r . . . showing that the correct segmentation of Lakedaímo–n is not Lake-daímo–n but Laked-aimo–n.”34 Jasanoff and Nussbaum’s failure to acknowledge Oswald Szemerényi as the author of this hypothesis gives it a spurious “scientific”



518 BLACK ATHENA
validity. In fact, Szemerényi’s hypothesis is generally seen as idiosyncratic. Jasanoff and Nussbaum wisely do not venture an etymology of their own, but Szemerényi proposed that the first segment was originally not Laked- but Laken-. The latter would be related to Lako–n, Laconian. Szemerényi further offered that Aimo–n should be linked to Haimo–nes, a people Stephanus reported to be living in Thessaly and other parts of Greece.35 Chadwick hesitated on the proposal, while Chantraine calls it “ingenious” but remains doubtful. Before setting out his hypothesis, Szemerényi admitted that “all interpreters, both ancient and modern, agree that the division is Lake-daivmwn.”36
“Spirit of Anubis”
Lakedaimo–n could well be a Hellenosemitic calque for the Egyptian KÅ ˆnpw “spirit of Anubis” Kano–pos. In Ptolemaic times the city of Kano–pos or Kanobus stood near the mouth of the westernmost, Kano–pic branch of the Nile. As there is no attestation of an Egyptian toponym *KÅ >Inpw, it is generally assumed that the name originated in Greek—from Kanopos the legendary steersman of Menelaos, king of Sparta. The shifting courses and the names of the branches of the Nile are subjects of great complexity. Gardiner, however, is convincing when he associates the Kanopic branch of Ptolemaic times with Rammesid references to KÅ, which he relates to the western branch of the river called Agathodaimo–n “Good Daimo–n” by Ptolemy the geographer and astronomer, among many other things.37 I believe that the connection is strengthened if, instead of read
ing the relevant hieroglyph © (D29) KÅ as Gardiner does, one reads it, as I should prefer, as KÅ ntr “sacred Ka.” I believe that there are grounds for identifying Agathodaimo–n with KÅ >Inpw and Kano–pos. In his study of the concept of Daimo–n, Walter Burkert pointed out that “only in one special case does Daimon appear in cult and iconography: as Good Daimon, Agathos Daimon–. The first libation at wine drinking . . . is made in his honour.” Burkert then quotes the libation of the godlike Phaeacians to Argeïphontes [Hermes].38 For the following reasons, I believe that it is fair to associate Agathodaimo–n and the Kano–pic, the branch of the Nile, with Anubis. In the first place there is the later name Kano–pos; second a major city on the branch was Hermopolis “city of Hermes,” the Greek counterpart of Thoth and Anubis.”39 In Egyptian cosmology the west was the direction of death; therefore, it would be appropriate for the westernmost channel



[CH. 21] SPARTA 519
to be associated with Anubis, who lead the dead to the afterlife. For these reasons, in addition to the fact that the name is easily explained in Egyptian but inexplicable in Greek, it would seem very unlikely indeed that the name Kano–b/pos was Greek rather than Egyptian. At least since the time of Hekataios of Miletos in the sixth century BCE, the legendary Kano–bos of Amyklai in Lakonia was seen as the pilot to Menelaos. He apparently was the cause of the king’s landing in Egypt at Kano–pos where Kano–bos was bitten by a snake and died.40 He was supposed to have given his name to Canopus, the star otherwise known as Alpha Carinae [boats]. It is the second brightest star in the heavens, after Sirius. At least since the Ptolemaic period the star was portrayed as the guide of the ship constellation Argo, which is associated with Osiris, lord of the dead.41 It is interesting to note that in Ptolemaic times Osiris was worshipped at Kano–pos as a vase or boat with a human head. According to Plutarch, Heraklides of Pontos, of the fourth century BCE had maintained that the famous oracle of Kano–pos was one of Pluto.42 In general, Kano–pos was clearly associated with the realms of death and navigation thither, precisely those of Anubis.43 There are further associations between Lako–n and Lakedaimo–n and Anubis in his role as guardian of, and guide for, the dead. According to many mythographers Lakedaimo–n was the child of the nymph who gave her name to Tau?geto", the mountain range between Lakonia and Messenia.44 The best etymology for this Taygeton is from the Egyptian TÅ(w) igrt “land(s) of the realm of the dead.” >Igrt “necropolis” has the
mountain determinative ' (N25). TÅw igrt is attested in the of Coming
Forth by Day and ˆgrt itself is a standard term for “necropolis.”45 The semantic case for the derivation is strengthened not only by the wild desolation of the mountain’s scenery, but also by the fact that viewed from Sparta two peaks of Taygetos look uncannily like pyramids.46 There are further local associations with death. The caves at Cape Tainavron at the southern tip of Taygetos were generally supposed to be the entry to the underworld.47 The cape’s patron was Poseidon, the counterpart of the Egyptian Seth, but also the cave was guarded by the monstrous dog Kerberos who had Anubian and other Egyptian aspects.48 The guide to the caves was Hermes.49 Thus, all in all, jackals and other canine carrion eaters, together with Anubis SpÅ(t) and the Underworld, seem to provide themes that can link Sparta to Lakedaimon and Lakonia. Another possible link between Lako–n and Anubis is that a subsidiary meaning of Lako–n was “a throw in dice.” Anubis as guide to the dead



520 BLACK ATHENA
played a prominent role in various Egyptian and other board games, most of which appear to have originated as attempts to discover how the soul would fare after death. Many pieces were shaped as the heads of dogs and other canines. We know that these games were played in the seventeenth century BCE not only in Egypt but also in Hyksos Palestine.50 Another indication of this association comes from the fact that the kuon–lakaina was a well-known type of hunting dog. A fifth century monument to Apollodoros and Lako–n, sons of Lako–n, was surmounted by a relief of a dog.51 The links among dogs and Lakonia and Sparta are strengthened by the fact that one of the four villages that originally made up the city was called Kunovsoura “dog’s tail” and its inhabitants Kynosuris, the name of a breed of Spartan hounds.52 Stephanus listing Kynosoura, a height in Arkadia, stated that it was named after the kynosouron “dog, dog’s tail” of Hermes.53 Hermes’ association with dogs, and hence with Anubis, is increased by the characteristic headgear of the Greek god: a kunevh “dogskin cap.”
Hermes
Now we come to Hermes. He was a composite deity with many disparate attributes and functions.54 It would seem useful at this point to consider the Greek god’s name, which is probably neither Indo-European nor Egyptian but Semitic. The conventional derivation for Hermes is from e{rma (H) “cairn or post.”55 There is, however, no secure Indo-European etymology for herma itself. It would seem better to derive herma from the Canaanite h≥er–em (<h≥arma) “taboo, banned,” which had many associations with stones and cairns. As in other cultures, the religions of many Semitic-speaking peoples identified the sacred and the vile. Both were seen as set apart and untouchable. Thus an Arab monarch’s wives live in a h≥aram and, more importantly, religious and damned sites are under the same h≥ere–m or “ban.”56 Stoning appears to have been the penalty for such a ban on an individual. This would make sense to the extent that the tribal god represented or was the community and that stoning was a communal punishment.57 Chapter 7 of the Book of Joshua is concerned with the h≥e\rem placed by Yahveh, through Joshua, on Jericho. This ban culminated with the violator, who had stolen treasure from the destroyed city, suffering the following fate: “Then all the Israelites stoned him to death; and they raised a great pile of stones over him which remains to this



[CH. 21] SPARTA 521
day.”58 A perceived connection between Hermes and this form of punishment in the Aegean can be seen in the statement by the historian Xanthos of the fifth century BCE that the gods in anger stoned Hermes after his acquittal for the murder of Argos.59 This shows a relation between cairns and stoning as punishment in both southwest Asia and the Aegean. Such a doubling can be seen in Arabia today. According to Muslim tradition, the village of Mina or Muna near Meccah is stoned by demons at all times of the year except during the h≥aj when a sacred fair is held there. In the village are three small pillars, which it is the duty of all  ̇aji@j to stone. The stones have to be wrapped in sacred garments, the ih≥ram or h≥erem, and immediately after the lapidation pilgrims remove the garments that they have worn throughout their time in the h≥aram or sacred territory of Meccah. Here as elsewhere cairns and pillars are considered to form its boundary.60 Thus a Semitic origin for herma as “sacred pillar or cairn” would seem plausible in the absence of any convincing Indo-European alternative. H≥armåh “asylum” is the name of a Canaanite city.61 Similarly, {Arma seems to have been the name of a well-defended site in Boiotia.62 It was also the name of a sacred crag in Attika.63 Such a mountain name does not to my knowledge exist in the Levant, but the highest peak in the Anti-Lebanon range is Mount H≥ermôn, which comes from the same root with the addition of the common Canaanite suffix -on. The name certainly indicates its sanctity. It may also have referred to its function as a boundary.64 The same toponym appears in Greece as EJrmiwvn, EJrmiovnh found in different places. The most famous of these, the one in the Argolid, housed ancient and important sanctuaries.65 In the Argive Hermione the sanctuary of Eileithuia was called Mase–s. The Pr mst “house of birth,” known to Egyptologists as Mamissi, was the name of a relatively small chapel found on the grounds of major temples. They are most frequently known from Ptolemaic or Roman times but one is attested as early as the Eighteenth Dynasty.66 The connection with Eileithuia, goddess of childbirth, strongly points to this etymology. At this point we should consider another Semitic verbal root ÷h°rm “to pierce, make a hole.” From this root are derived such forms in Arabic as tahr°ima “lacework, open work, filigree” and muh°arram “done in open work, filigree,” from which come the French and English macramé “lace and fringed borders.” The merger in Canaanite of /h°/ with /h≥/ made the old hr°m into h≥rm. This change is attested in the biblical Hebrew h≥åram



522 BLACK ATHENA
“to slit or perforate the nose” and h≥ere–m “net.” In Phoenician h≥rm is “maker of nets.”67 Despite the phonetic barrier between /h°/ and /h≥/, it is possible that h≥rm and hr°m were originally connected. H≥ere–m “ban,” in the sense of being possessed, caught or tied down by god, may well be derived from a wider root. A parallel for this semantic association is found in the Egyptian iÅdt “net” and iÅdt “tract of land” and later “sacred enclosure.”68 Nevertheless, it helps to distinguish the two Semitic roots when considering different aspects of the root ÷hrm in Greek. Hrm from h≥rm “perforation net,” already wide ranging in Canaanite, has been extraordinarily productive in Greek. At least three branches have diverged: First: another meaning of e{rma (H) hermata is attested: “earring, band, noose or snake’s coils.” Second: {arma (H), Jarmhv (5), Jarmov" (5) all have the general sense “to tie, join together.” Chantraine points out that the Mycenaean amo, dual amote, plural amota—like harma—does not mean “chariot” but rather “parts of a chariot.” These would need to be assembled or fitted together. {Armena (H) is the “tackle of a ship.” JArmovzw is “to mesh, fit together.” This then leads to Jarmoniva (H) “joint in carpentry and masonry.” Harmonia is also fitting together on the musical scale but it can also mean “necklace.” Third: the words based on horma-: o{rmo" (H) is a “cord, chain, necklace, mooring line or anchorage.” From the last comes the meaning “haven.” JOrmaqivzw “to string together” is used metaphorically as “to reason.” Hormia is a “fishing line” and hormiantonos and hormeutes “fishermen.” Having completed this excursion, I think the least unsatisfactory primary etymology for the name Hermes is from the Semitic root h≥rm/hr°m in the sense “penetrate, pierce, string together.” In Chapter 19, I discussed his relationship to the planet Mercury passing from and leading souls from one sphere to another.69 This sense is found in Jermeneuv" (5) “intepreter.” This meaning does not exclude as a secondary source the conventional derivation from the Hellenosemitic hermata “cairns or pillars used as boundary markers” as another of the origins of Hermes’ name.70 Hermes appears to be one of the few inaccuracies in Herodotos’ list of divine names, in that he did not exclude it from the Egyptian ones.71 The Semitic name does not rule out the derivation of many of Hermes’ attributes from his acknowledged association with Thoth and Anubis and his unacknowledged connection to Seth.



[CH. 21] SPARTA 523
Anubis and canines
Returning to Anubis, we can note that Plutarch wrote on an abstract level:
when Nephthys gave birth to Anubis, Isis treated the child as if it were her own; for Nephthys is that which is beneath the earth and invisible, Isis that which is above the earth and visible; and the circle which touches these, called the horizon, being common to both has received the name Anubis, and is represented in form like a dog; for a dog can see with his eyes both by night and by day alike.72
This amphibiousness and potential for mediation is shared by the moon, the heavenly light in the darkness while the sun is in the underworld. Another aspect of the Greek god does not fit the ancient scheme. It is what I would call the Osiran one: Hermes the ithyphallic progenitor of herds. He was the patron of a vineyard in Lemnos where he was known as Kadmilos—the Canaanite name Kadmyc el “El is the old one” is attested in the Bible.73 This aspect is particularly evident in Attika, Arkadia and the northern Aegean, all areas of considerable continuity with the Bronze Age. Some of these features may come from confusion with hermai and rock cults. Others could well derive from the indigenous population of the Middle Bronze Age. Herodotos maintained that
These practices then, and others which I will speak of later, were borrowed by the Greeks from Egypt. This is not the case however, with the Greek custom of making images of Hermes with the phallus erect; it was the Athenians who took this from the Pelasgians and from the Athenians the custom spread to the rest of Greece.74
Thus, we may have here a remnant of the religion of the Indo-Europeanspeaking natives. Even here, however, there may be some Egyptian and Semitic influence. Osiris or Tammuz appears under many names in Greece. As well as Dionysos—this title is supposed to have come later than the others—although its attestation in Linear B shows that it must have arrived by the thirteenth century BCE. As mentioned in chapters 10 and 18, I have referred to Pan and Pentheus as the Egyptian names and Bakchos as the Semitic name for “[the] bewailed.”75 Thus, finding the dead and reviving god of nature referred to in certain regions as Hermes is not surprising, especially in



524 BLACK ATHENA
view of the fact that both Thoth and Anubis were so deeply involved in the judgment of the dead, around which the cult of Osiris also revolved. What is more, as pointed out above, in some Egyptian theologies a relationship existed among SpÅ, Anubis and Osiris. All of this leads us back to Sparta and the cult of Hermes as the messenger of death and the guardian of the dead. Farnell claimed that “in Laconia his cult was neither prominent nor important.”76 Plutarch’s report of the strange Spartan attitude to theft—of which Hermes was the patron—the story of the fox and the importance of Hermes at the entrance to the Underworld at Tainaron, all taken together indicate that he was indeed important. There is, however, a much more obvious sign of his centrality and Farnell seems to have missed its significance entirely. This was the archaic statue of Hermes carrying an infant Dionysos that Pausanias saw in the middle of Sparta.77 Its centrality was more than geographic, as the figure appeared frequently as an emblem of the city on coins issued in Sparta during the Roman period.78 Pausanias called the statue Agoraios “of the market place” but this—in anticommercial Sparta of all places—is unlikely to have meant that this Hermes was exclusively concerned with trade. The theme was clearly that referred to in the fifth century CE by the Hellenized Egyptian, Nonnos: “Thus Hermes carried upon his arm the little brother who had passed through one birth without a bath, and lay now without a tear, a baby with a good pair of horns like the Moon. He gave him in charge of the daughters of Lamos, river nymphs, the son of Zeus, the vineplanter. They received Bakchos into their arms.”79 The same motif of Hermes carrying Dionysos appears on a vase from Campagnia and on a coin from Pheneus in Arkadia. It is also seen in the famous statue attributed to Praxiteles and found at Olympia.80 The figure survived into late antiquity when it appeared in a mosaic from Antioch in which the child Dionysos has a halo. The motif is clearly the origin of the Christian iconography of Saint Christopher.81 The early forms of the Christian legend, showing the divine child on his protector’s shoulders would seem to be closer to Egyptian vignettes—unnoted by the historians of classical art—in which the child Osiris is carried to heaven on a god’s back.82 These vignettes are on a papyrus from the Nineteenth Dynasty. As Anubis is the only male guide and protector of Osiris, he is almost certainly the god represented. The theme of a person or deity carrying a childish Osiris is also common in later Egyptian sculpture, especially from the Saite Dynasty.83



[CH. 21] SPARTA 525
The motif of Hermes carrying Dionysos to immortal protection was frequently represented in Greek art, but in a disguised form: Hermes Kriophoros “carrying a ram.” This image of a “good shepherd” with a sheep carried over his shoulders or in some other way is obviously of general attraction. Nevertheless, its significance as an artistic motif in both the Levant and the Aegean—where the statuette of Hermes Kriophoros from Arkadia, mentioned above, shows it to have been very ancient—can be pinned down with more precision. The identification of a young sacrificed prince with a ram or lamb is found in Canaanite and Greek mythology, in the biblical Akedah, or “binding of Isaac,” and in the myth of Athamas.84 Osiris’ identification with a ram or goat in
Egypt and Libya will be discussed below in connection with Dionysos’ close relation with these animals in Greece. As far as I am aware, no Egyptian representations show Anubis or anybody else carrying the Mendesion ram or goat with which Osiris was identified. Nevertheless, men and rams are pictured together as, for instance, in an Eighteenth Dynasty blue faience scarab found in a geometric level at the shrine of Artemis Orthia at Sparta.85 In the quotation from Nonnos given above, the infant Dionysos is given horns. Apollodoros was equally specific: “But Zeus eluded the wrath of Hera by turning Dionysos into a kid and Hermes took him and brought him to the nymphs.”86 This theme is the same as the Egyptian one in which the child Osiris is taken to heaven. In the latter case it is clear that, as in Christianity, the rise from death to immortality of the child god stands for a similar rise for the individual worshipper. Thus, Anubis is concerned with guiding worshippers through death to heavenly bliss.
Amyklai and Hyakinthos
Motifs of this type had a prominent position on the throne of Apollo at Amyklai, the greatest religious center in Lakonia, which seems to have been built in the seventh or sixth century BCE.87 According to Pausanias, these included scenes in which “Hermes is carrying the child Dionysos to heaven, and Athene is bringing Herakles to live with the gods forever after, Peleus is handing over Achilles to be brought up by Chiron.”88 The other themes are mainly of heroic victories over monsters. This description raises the problems of the cult of Apollo at Amyklai and of the identity of the dead deity JUavkinqo" whose tomb was at the center of the shrine. In late antiquity Hyakinthos was supposed to have



526 BLACK ATHENA
been a Lakonian youth with whom Apollo fell in love and whom he killed by accident. For the romantic scholars of the nineteenth century the cult symbolized the Aryan and Dorian conquest. It was their god Apollo’s triumph over the pre-Hellenic and chthonic Hyakinthos, a mysterious and dark spirit of vegetation altogether appropriate to the static Pelasgians.89 Recent scholarship has modified this picture but not fundamentally altered it. Hyakinthos is no longer seen as pre-Greek. His cult is believed to have started in Lakonia in the Late Bronze Age. From there the Dorians carried it to Crete and other Dorian islands.90 The sharp division between Hyakinthos and Apollo is maintained on these islands and worship of the latter is seen as an Iron Age imposition upon the earlier cult. Paul Cartledge, who centers his work regarding Sparta on the cult at Amyklai, quotes Rhys Carpenter with approval on the “philological game of hopscotch.” This, Cartledge says, “is best exemplified in Astour 1967. . . . Like hopscotch this sort of approach explains nothing and gets you nowhere.”91 Unfortunately, for scholars like Dr. Cartledge, this brand of archaeological positivism has not moved the problem forward either. Luckily, other classicists have not been so blinkered. Some, like Burkert, Willetts, Dietrich, and West, have considered the name Amyklai and the implications of its etymology.92 The key piece of evidence is a bilingual inscription found at Idalion in Cyprus and dedicated in Greek to A-polo-ni A-mu-ko-lo-i (Apollo Amyklos) and in Phoenician to Rsp Mkl (Resheph Mikal). As Resheph is generally acknowledged to be the Phoenician counterpart of Apollo there has never been any doubt about the connection between this cult and the Lakonian one. For Farnell the answer was obvious: the Amyklean cult was brought by “Achaean” settlers from Lakonia to Cyprus.93 The worshipers at Idalion, however, seem to have been Phoenician not Greek. Furthermore a Canaanite cult of Mkl was located at Beth Shean in Palestine in the Late Bronze Age.94 Both Albright and Astour have agreed that Mkl—probably vocalized *Mukol or *Mukal—originally came from the Emesal or the women’s dialect of Sumerian and that the last syllable is gal “great,” which was regularly transposed into West Semitic as kal. For instance, the Sumerian E gal “big house” became the Canaanite hêkål “palace, temple.” Albright proposed an origin for Mukal from the Emesal title Umun-urugalla “lord of the great city” for the Mesopotamian deity Nergal “lord of Hades.”95 Astour more plausibly argues that Mkl derived from mu-gal “great tree,”



[CH. 21] SPARTA 527
which is attested as a divine name and possibly appears in the common Akkadian name Mu-ka-la/li. He has also pointed out that this meaning would fit neatly with representations of Amyklai on Lakonian coins where the shrine is depicted as a pillar or inverted tree trunk, narrower at the bottom that at the top, with an arm and a helmeted head.96 At this point in the discussion all that is necessary to indicate is that, in this instance at least, Astour has “got us somewhere,” however, much Dr. Cartledge may dislike its location. Astour has made it clear that the name (A)myklai is connected to Resheph/Apollo, that a pillar on a tree trunk spread from the Levant to Cyprus and Lakonia at some stage, and that the Spartan town coined its name from this depiction. Left open is the question of whether or not an earlier cult of Apollo existed at that site. Before tackling this question, however, we should consider the festival of Hyakinthia as a whole.
Hyakinthia
The festival of Hyakinthia took place in the spring. Hyakinthos was mourned on the first day, then there was a solemn banquet without bread or wine. The next two days appear to have been joyful celebrations of victory and rebirth and the possible ascension to heaven generally associated with Apollo.97 Seeds and agriculture were an important theme. Hyakinthos’ age seems to have varied. At times he was a ravishing youth but, as Pausanias pointed out, a more ancient sculpture represented him as bearded.98 Nevertheless, he was also a divine child, eniautos daimo\n. Goats seem to have been sacrificed at the festival and were a central symbol of it. One often appeared next to the “tree trunk” Apollo on the coins referred to by Astour.99 So too did a cock, the symbol of the resurrection, and Apollo’s double Askle\peios, as discussed in Chapter 19.100 The Hyakinthia was of course associated with a spring flower, although the original “hyacinth” was probably an iris.101 In fact Hyakinthia had striking correspondences with the Christian Easter. The first day is spent mourning the young god’s death with the solemnity transformed—in the Orthodox Church—by the cry of Khristos aneste “Christ is Risen” and followed with general rejoicing. The pattern is, however, very common. It fits, for instance, the Egyptian festivals in which Isis’ sorrow for the dead Osiris was marked with wailing and mourning and then followed by ecstatic joy at Osiris’ resurrection or the triumph of his son Horus. Nonnos drew a clear parallel between



528 BLACK ATHENA
Hyakynthia and the Eleusinian ritual of resurrection, which was also based on Egyptian festivals of Osiris. Nonnos described the rituals in two successive poems. The first was on Demeter and Eleusis. The second was in the Amyclean style:
Apollo brought to life again his long-haired Hyacinthos. Staphylos will be made to live for aye by Dionysos.102
Despite the confusion between the Dionysiac Staphylos “grape” and Dionysos himself, all three—Hyakinthos, Dionysos and Staphylos—can most plausibly be seen as forms of Osiris, god of the Nile flood and wine, as discussed in Chapter 18.103 Apart from this and the cultic parallels mentioned above, no other connections between Hyakinthia and Egypt are apparent. The first day of the fast then festival was called Kopiv". This can plausibly be linked to the stem kop- “to be weary” and kopeto- “noise of lamentations.” Although there is a good Indo-European etymology for the Greek stem kop in the sense of “chop,” there is none for it in this other sense. It would seem plausible to link Kopis, a day of fasting, to the Egyptian gb “deficiency, deprivation” and gby “to be feeble, miserable.” In Coptic these appear as job–or c=ob–.
On another point, just as Osiris had his sister companion Isis, Hyakinthos had his sister Polyboia who accompanied him to heaven. Although it generally simply means wealthy, the name “many cattle” suggests connection with the cow goddess Hathor who was identified with Isis at—it is interesting to note—Kano–pos.104 All of these components—the meaning of the name Amyklai, the derivation of Apollo’s ancient title Paio–n from his equivalent Horus’ epithet PÅ iwn “the pillar,” worship of a tree trunk and goats, and the theme of resurrection—bring Hyakinthia extraordinarily close to the cult of Osiris as the Mendesian goat and a Dd or lopped tree. Along with the other evidence of Egyptian religious influence in Sparta discussed above, that the Hyakinthia was based on a festival of Osiris, specifically on the great WÅg set at the beginning of the Nile flood, seems plausible. In this case one could derive Hyakinthia from *WÅg ntr “holy WÅg” and view Hyakinthos, not as a divinity in his own right, but merely as the personification of the feast. No doubt exists that Hyakinthia the festival was far more widely known than Hyakinthos the hero.105 Given the intensity of the taboo on Osiris’ name (discussed above),



[CH. 21] SPARTA 529
the desire to find alternatives is understandable and the semantic correspondence between Hyakinthia and *WÅg ntr would seem quite good. The phonetic fit is also reasonably satisfactory.106 Aspiration was automatic with the upsilon. Indeed, Frisk and Chantraine accept the claims of their predecessors that the name was originally  ̧avkinqo". With the neutralization of stops, the shift from /g/ to /k/ is quite acceptable. The many parallels where the Egyptian ntr was found in the Greek -nthos were discussed in Chapter 10.107 The case that kantharos and katharos derive from kÅ ntr has been made in that previous chapter. These names resemble that of the Theban hero Káanthos, another Osiris figure who, like Hyakinthos, was killed by Apollo.108 Hyakinthos’ relation to hyacinth fits the common pattern of young heroes whose life blood flows into a flower that is brilliant but quickly fades: Adonis, Attis, Ajax and, of course, Kaanthos and Hyakinthos.109
“LATE” BORROWINGS AND LYKURGOS
Orge\and orgia were borrowed from wÅg in the Bronze Age when /Å/ still had consonantal value. Hyakinthos was copied from *WÅg ntr after /Å/ had lost this value, therefore, relatively late. In such “lateness” Hyakinthos would seem to resemble some other Lakonian names. Taygetos must have come from TÅw igrt, not only after the vocalization of /Å/ but also after that of /r/in certain positions. This, however, does not tell us whether or not these introductions came before or after the collapse of Mycenaean society in the twelfth century BCE. We have then to face the question of continuity and change between Bronze and Iron Age Lakonia. Following the fashionable preference for indigenous developments, recent observers have tended to see the palatial age ending in a revolt rather than an invasion.110 This account would tally with such features as the apparent return to Middle Bronze Age cultural traits during this period and makes a plausible partial explanation.111 Nevertheless, as Paul Cartledge rightly points out, some features cannot be explained simply by the hypothesis of local revolt.112 First is the universal belief during antiquity that the Dorians invaded from the north with the return of the Heraklids. Second was the presence of Dorian tribes who in historical times believed themselves to have come from northern Greece and who spoke what appears to have been a northwestern Greek dialect. Thus the most plausible explanation would seem to be that, as with many other invasions notably those at the end of the



530 BLACK ATHENA
Roman Empire, the outside barbarians received considerable support from poor people crushed by the oppression of ruling class civilization. Although it gives no direct evidence of an invasion, archaeology confirms that a drastic change occurred when tradition maintained that the Heraklids had “returned.” In Lakonia the population appears to have fallen sharply in the twelfth and eleventh centuries, although some centers like Amyklai it actually increased during this period. The tenth century seems to have been even more depressed, which has led Paul Cartledge to argue, rather unconvincingly, that the invasion or infiltration of the Dorians took place considerably later than the legendary return of the Heraklids.113 As Thucydides claimed, the succeeding period was very unstable. According to traditional historiography, however, the situation was transformed by Lukou'rgo" who established such excellent institutions that Sparta suffered no internal disruption for several centuries. Plutarch opened his biography of the statesman: “Concerning Lycurgus the lawgiver, in general nothing can be said that is not disputed, since indeed there are different accounts of his birth, his travels, his death and above all his work as a lawmaker and statesman; and there is least agreement among historians as to the times in which the man lived.”114 Following the tradition of critical scholarship some modern writers have denied his historicity altogether and see him as a god.115 To back their case, they have the Delphic oracle reported by Herodotos:
I know not whether to declare you human or divineYet I incline to believe Lykurgos that you are a god.116
There is no question that myths seem to have accreted to Lykurgos. Nevertheless, there seems no reason to doubt the ancient conclusions that he was a member of the Spartan Europontid royal family, that he lived some time in the ninth and early eighth centuries, that he traveled extensively and that he introduced important institutional reforms.117 Lakonian archaeology has been particularly uninformative about chronology because there seem to be no detectable changes in pottery styles between 950 and 750 BC. Nevertheless, major changes were clearly taking place during the second half of this period. Both wealth measured by imports from other parts of Greece and the Near East and by local



[CH. 21] SPARTA 531
production increased strikingly. These economic changes have been convincingly linked to the beginnings of Sparta’s piecemeal conquest of Messenia.118 It would seem plausible to associate these changes with the institutional ones, as does ancient tradition attributed to Lykurgos at about this time. Tradition maintained that Lykurgos had traveled widely. Plutarch felt unable to accept all the claims but he did believe that the lawgiver had visited Crete, Ionia, Asia and Egypt. According to the later writer, Lykurgos was not impressed by Ionia. Although he was supposed to have introduced the Homeric epics for their moral value, there is no mention of any institutional borrowing.119 Very few scholars would challenge the likelihood of Lykurgos’ having been to Crete, which was close to Sparta and was dominated by Dorians. That he used their institutions as models would seem altogether plausible in view of the similarities between those of Crete and Sparta in historical times. This was brought out clearly by Aristotle in The Politics when he saw both as the best examples of mixed constitutions.120 Aristotle bracketed these favorite Greek constitutions with that of Carthage with which they shared remarkable similarities, as Robert Drews has clearly shown.121 Given the much earlier attestation of these structures in the Levant and the general cultural flow in the ninth century, the Cretan and Spartan systems must have borrowed from Phoenicia rather than the other way round. Thus, the overall derivation of the Greek polis from the Phoenician city-states would seem to be particularly closely linked here.122 These political borrowings were part of a much larger whole. The tenth and ninth centuries saw the peak of Tyre’s prosperity and power. Recent archaeological assessments tend to confirm Homer’s picture of a Phoenician domination over eastern Mediterranean trade in this period.123 Spectacular caches of Phoenician goods have been found in ninth century strata in Crete and the stylistic innovations of the Cretan “ProtoGeometric” and the Attic Middle-Geometric (c. 850) were clearly the result of Levantine influence.124 The Cretan and Lakonian alphabets appear to have been deeply affected by what, in Cadmean Letters, I have called the Phoenician or Iron Age waves of influence that sharply modified the Bronze Age Hellenic alphabet.125 Interesting loans of constitutionally important words also occurred: for instance, kaddikhos, the term used for a “voting urn” or “bowl” in the Spartan messes almost certainly comes from the Late Canaanite kad “jar.”126 Equally, leskhe\“lounging place, council hall” is



532 BLACK ATHENA
clearly related to the Hebrew liskåh “a room connected with a sanctuary where sacrificial meal was eaten.”127 Among the Dorians, Phoenicians and Jews, as well as Greeks Etruscans and Romans, lounging on a couch was the status symbol of a freeman. John Pairman Brown has pointed out that Pausanias described a painted leskhe\with accompanying shrines dedicated to the hero Kadmos.128 Interestingly, however, neither of these words has a clear Semitic root. The most likely origins are ultimately from the Egyptian qd “pot” and *r-ski “place for passing time.”129 This leads back to Lykurgos’ contacts with Egypt. Both Diodoros and Plutarch stated that Egyptians believed him to have studied in Egypt and to have borrowed social and political institutions from there. Plutarch did not commit himself to this idea but he admitted that some Greek historians had also shared this opinion.130 Nothing is inherently implausible about the idea of Lykurgos, or other Spartans with whom he may have been conflated, visiting Egypt at this time. No navigational difficulties would hamper it and, even in its disunity at the end of the Twentysecond and the beginning of the Twenty-third dynasties, Egypt, by contemporary Greek standards, was immensely rich and possessed the towering cultural prestige of two and half millennia of civilization. In fact, archaeological evidence suggests that there were substantial contacts between Sparta and Egypt in the early eighth century. Many Egyptian objects have been found in the lowest stratum of the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia near Sparta. Furthermore, as Pendlebury pointed out:
Besides these objects, one has only to look through the pages of any work on early Spartan statuettes to see a striking resemblance to Egyptian examples. This resemblance is chiefly due to the presence of a wig—or it may be some method of dressing the hair which gives a general likeness to the Egyptian wig or striped head cloth.
The cautious scholar then added to this unorthodox observation: “Whether this is due to a definite Egyptian influence or to mere coincidence it is hard to determine.”131
LAKONIAN TERMINOLOGY EGYPTIAN?
In this context it is striking to find so many specifically Spartan political terms that lack Indo-European etymologies but have plausible ones in Egyptian: lovco" in the sense of a “military company” would seem to



[CH. 21] SPARTA 533
come from the Egyptian rh°yt, l h°e–in Old Coptic “subjects, plebeians.” Another example is ∆Wbav, a local division of the Spartan people. Obazo\ meant “to divide people into obai.” A plausible etymology for these Spartan terms would be the Egyptian wpi “to divide” and the substantive wpwt “household, crowd, inventory.” Opa appears frequently in Linear B. Chadwick translates it as “contribution.” This meaning would fit wpi in the sense of “division of people or goods.” As mentioned in Chapter 19, the related Egyptian verb ˆp “to count” with the preposition /r/ ˆp r “to be detailed for task” provides a plausible etymology for the otherwise unexplained Lakonian ajpellavzw “to assemble” and ajpevllai “assembly, especially of young people.”132 Spartan messes of men who ate together were called fidi—vtia. Plutarch derived this from philitia because they were conducive to friendship. Alternatively, he also suggested the derivation from editia “eating.”133 A more likely etymology for this is from the Egyptian pdt “troop of soldiers.” The vocalization of the first syllable was clearly /i/, which remained constant in Egyptian when long and accented. Its presence in the name Lapith from R-pdt was mentioned above in Chapter 9.134 It can also be seen in the Coptic form pite for the Egyptian pdt “bow,” which seems to have been the basis for the root. Finally, there is the Spartan term Ei{lwte" (5) “helots.” No satisfactory Indo-European etymology exists for this famous word.135 Here again there is a more plausible Egyptian etymology *h≥ryw tÅ “those who are on the land” analogous to the attested form h≥ryw s=Œy “those who are on the sand, Bedouin.” This word would parallel the biblical Œammê hå>åres5 “peoples of the earth [the Canaanites, who inhabited the land before the Israelites].” No linguistic grounds exist for claiming that these copies date from the Iron Age. Two other reasons, however, can be postulated. First, the use of these words is restricted to Sparta. If they had been borrowed in the Bronze Age, they more likely appear elsewhere. Second, a strong tradition holds that Lykurgos based at least some of his institutional reforms on Egypt. The new forms were not imported indiscriminately and Dorian tribal traditions were not neglected. Neither were the requirements of a new state ignored, especially the need to keep large numbers of Helots in perpetual and productive subjugation.136 The existence of Cretan names with Indo-European roots for similar institutions suggests that the Spartan rulers may simply have introduced fancy Egyptian names to replace common Dorian, or more widely used, Hellenic forms. Given the conservatism of Iron Age Crete, this explanation would seem more



534 BLACK ATHENA
likely than the other possibility that the Cretans naturalized the Egyptian institutions and terms. The most plausible general motive for the Spartans’ having adopted Egyptian terminology would be the desire for the Dorians to appear cultivated. Another example of this process can be seen in the Spartan cult of the Dioskouroi. Walter Burkert plausibly sees a parallel between the Spartan Dioskouroi [sons of Zeus] and the Vedic Asvins as twins concerned with horses. He is, however, unable to explain either their curious cult fetish of two beams dovka±na and crossbars or their name in Sparta, Tyndaridai or Tindaridai the sons of Tundavrew".137 The alternation itself suggests a copying. A possible etymology for Tyndaridai can be found in the attested, but mysterious, Egyptian term dnh n drww. Faulkner translates this “wing rib(?)” In Coptic dnh (te\nh, tenh or tnh) means “wing” and drww means “flank, set of ribs.” Gardiner wrote about drww “since the duality of the term is often insisted upon . . . in such cases the writer was thinking of both sides together.”138 Drww was used for two opposite sides in a more general sense of chests and coffins. It may also have had architectural connotations because dri, drw and drwt all appears to have meant “walls.” As far as I am aware, no matching cult existed in Egypt. The most likely explanation is that the Spartans provided Egyptian names and imagery for an indigenous cult. Specifically, the Spartan rulers may have wanted to secure their legitimacy as Heraklids. It is very unlikely that Herodotos was being original when he saw the latter as Egyptians:
The common Greek tradition is, that the Dorian kings as far back as Perseus, the son of Danae [thus not including the god], are as they stand in the Greek lists, and are rightly considered as of Greek nationality, because even at this early date they were ranked as such, I am justified in saying ‘as far back as Perseus,’ and not father, [sic] because Perseus had no human father by whose name he can be called. . . . If, on the other hand, we trace the ancestry of Danae, the daughter of Acrisius, we find that the Dorian chieftains were genuine Egyptians. This is the accepted Greek version of the genealogy of the Spartan royal house; the Persians, however, maintain that Perseus was an Assyrian who adopted Greek nationality; his ancestry, therefore, was not Greek; and the forebears of Acrisius were not related to Perseus at all but were Egyptian



[CH. 21] SPARTA 535
which accords with the Greek version of the story. But there is no need to pursue this subject further. How it happened that Egyptians came to the Peloponnese, and what they did to make themselves kings in that part of Greece, has been chronicled by other writers.139
The Persian version, which presumably derived from earlier Syrian and Mesopotamian records, appears to have reflected a belief that the Hyksos were more Syro-Palestinian than Egyptian. The Spartan kings’ conception of their Hyksos ancestry and their claim to be Egyptian Heraklids gave legitimacy to the Dorian overthrow of the Pelopid Akhaians. This idea about their ancestry does not appear to have diminished after the eighth century when, possibly as a result of the introduction of the Homeric epics, Spartan kings established the Menelaion, a shrine to the great Pelopid king that was shaped like a pyramid. Thus, they claimed both sources of legitimacy.140 A parallel to this could be seen in Queen Victoria’s establishment of a castle at Balmoral, thus incorporating the romantic Highland tradition of the Stuarts into that of her own House of Hanover, which had defeated it, without abandoning the heritage of the Glorious Revolution or the Protestant succession.141 The building of the Menelaion leads back to the problems of the extent to which Spartan religion survived the Dorian conquest and the date of the introduction of the religious toponyms. Material evidence of a cult at Amyklai exists from the fifteenth century BCE, and the use of the toponym in Homer’s particularly ancient Catalogue of Ships suggests that it was called by that name before the Trojan War in the thirteenth century.142 This longevity is emphasized by the possibility of continuous worship at Amyklai into historic times.143 Thus, it seems probable that, despite the major social and political upheavals and transformations, overall religion was continuous at Amyklai. Lapses and revivals based on outside traditions, documents and sources could also have happened. The relative lateness of such Egyptian and Phoenician names as Taygeton and Amyklai could be explained by the hypothesis that they were only introduced in the fifteenth century although Hyakinthia could be later. Still, other names, notably Sparta itself with its /Å/ retaining consonantal value, would be much older. Thus the centrality of the worship of Hermes-Anubis, Dionysos-Osiris and Apollo-Horus can be dated back to the beginning of the Mycenaean Age. Emphasis within the trinity may have shifted towards Apollo but a Spartan connection with dogs



536 BLACK ATHENA
was remembered to the end of antiquity.144 In some sense the old identification of Hermes and Anubis seems to have been retained.
SPARTA AND DEATH
At least from the Iron Age Spartans exposed unwanted infants at the foot of the Taygetos mountains and believed that the cave at Tainaron was the entrance to Hades. Even if the name’s origin from TÅ igrt “realm of the dead” may have been forgotten, the range’s association with death was still strong.145 In general, concern with death and rebirth into immortality was even more salient in Lakonia than elsewhere. Apart from the Trinity—Hermes, Dionysos, Apollo—the complex sets of twins in the cult of the Dioskouroi had the common feature of duality of mortal and immortal being.146 It is fascinating to speculate whether the ancient preoccupation affected the later warrior cult of death among the Spartans. Plutarch does report that Lykurgos simplified burial and forbade personal tombs.147 On the other hand, the ideal of sacrificing oneself for the country seems to have been promoted with extraordinary vigor. As Plutarch wrote describing Spartan songs, “they were for the most part praises of men who had died for Sparta calling them blessed and happy; censure of men who had played the coward, picturing their grievous and ill-starred life.148 Spartan soldiers’ willingness to die in battle was proverbial. Even boys did not protest when beaten to death at the festival of Artemis Orthia.149 The centrality of this Lakonian cult of death did not stop with the end of Spartan independence. Quite apart from its persistence in Christianity, the cult of death has survived in a pure form in the Mani Peninsula at the southern end of the Taygetos, near the cave at Tainaron. In this region the most elaborate and beautiful laments of all Greece continue to be made. Central to these and to the whole conception of death here is the figure of Cavrwn.150 In classical times he was merely the ferryman of death across the river Styx.151 In Etruscan religion, however, Charun seems to have had a greater importance as a bringer of death. One writer called him an “infernal Mercury.”152 Diodoros believed that the name was Egyptian.153 No known Egyptian name or verbal root, however, would seem appropriate. Yoel Arbeitman proposed a more plausible etymology from the West Semitic deity H≥rn, vocalized H≥o–ro–n in the Bible and known as “lord of Hell.” The name is clearly related to a



[CH. 21] SPARTA 537
Semitic stem h°(a)wr or h≥awr meaning “grave, pit, cavern.” The /a/ in Kharo\n indicates a borrowing before the Canaanite shift.154 In modern Greece Kharo\n has become not only the boatman but, as happened with the Etruscans, also both Hermes, the messenger of death, and Hades, the ruler of the dead. Despite these modifications, this survival shows an extraordinary cultural tenacity for at least three thousand five hundred years. To return to the connections that Spartan rulers saw with their supposed Egyptian or Hyksos ancestors. We know, for instance, that in the late seventh or early sixth centuries some of them or their advisers felt it worthwhile to remodel the national shrine the Menelaion as a “sort of small step pyramid.”155 It is impossible to say whether this construction was simply ostentation or the result of the Homeric tradition that Menelaos had spent time in Egypt or an attempt to emphasize the royal families’ Heraklid Egyptian ancestry.156 Pausanias wrote about the sanctuary of Ammon in Sparta: “The Lakonians seem to have used the Libyan oracle more than anyone else in Greece from the beginning. Ammon is not more honoured by the Libyan Ammonians than he is at Aphytis.”157 What Pausanias meant by “from the beginning” is impossible to say. It could refer to the Bronze Age, to the time of Lykurgos at the turn of the eighth century, or to the Spartan “Pyramid Age” of the seventh or sixth. In any event, it is unlikely to have been much after Pindar wrote his Hymn to Ammon early in the fifth.158 Pausanias’ only specific reference to the oracle was in connection with the Spartan general Lysander, who was active in the Peloponnesian War at the end of the fifth century.159
SPARTANS AND JEWS
About a hundred years after Lysander, the Spartan King Areios I (309265 BCE) is alleged to have written: “To Onias the High Priest, Greeting. A document has come to light which shows that the Spartans and the Jews are kinsmen descended alike from Abraham.” This letter is quoted in both Maccabbees and Josephus.160 Two questions occur immediately: one on the letter’s date and the other on its authenticity. Areios I of Sparta and the first high priest, Onias, were contemporaries around 300 BCE. Areios the second died as a child and did not reign at the same time as Onias the second or third. Thus there seems no reason to follow Josephus in dating it to a later



538 BLACK ATHENA
Onias. Arnaldo Momigliano, who believed in the authenticity of most of the documents contained in 1 Maccabbees, maintained that this letter was apocryphal. He admitted, however, that it must have been an early forgery. This dating is necessary to explain why the two succeeding letters, one of which he believed to be genuine, refer to the Jews as “brothers.”161 Naturally, working within the Aryan Model, he treated the idea of a relationship between Spartans and Jews as legendary and, by implication, absurd.162 In his chapter on the three letters Momigliano failed to mention Eduard Meyer’s discussion of the subject. Meyer accepted the authenticity of the letter because he believed that the “writings” [graphe\] referred to were those of Hekataios of Abdera whose work was written about 300 BCE.163 As mentioned above, Hekataios maintained that:
The natives of the land surmised that unless they removed the foreigners [the Hyksos] their troubles would never be resolved. At once therefore, the aliens were driven from the country, and the most outstanding and active among them banded together and, as some say, were cast ashore in Greece and certain other regions, their teachers were notable men among them being Danaus and Cadmus. But the greater number were driven into what is now called Judea which is not far from Egypt and was at that time utterly uninhabited. The colony was headed by a man called Moses.164
Despite some difficulties with the phrasing of the letter, probably explained by the double translation from Greek into Hebrew or Aramaic and back again, Meyer’s hypothesis that the Spartan letter was genuine seems convincing. It leaves open, however, the question of whether the king believed Hekataios because such a belief was fashionable after Alexander’s conquests in the east or because it fitted the Spartan rulers’ own traditions. Given the information set out above, the second factor would surely have played a part. The authenticity of the letter and the idea of Spartan Jewish contacts in the second century BCE are strengthened by the fact that in the 160s BCE the disreputable High Priest Jason (Joshua) took refuge in Sparta and died there. The last king of Sparta took the name Nabis (206–192 BCE). Despite his unusual name and his social revolutionary policies, there is no doubt that he was a Spartan and quite probably from one of the two royal families. Nevertheless, Nabis is certainly not a Greek name; it could,



[CH. 21] SPARTA 539
however, derive from either the Canaanite nåbî> “prophet” or the Egyptian neb “lord.” Or it could come from both.165 Thus from the Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period one finds substantial indications of Egyptian and West Semitic civilizations in Sparta, one aspect of which is linguistic. This is altogether what one should expect of the southernmost state on the Greek Mainland.

CHAPTER 22
ATHENA AND ATHENS
The Character of Athena, both in religion and in the myths, appears, then, to be the reflex of the civilised Hellenic polity. She was, it is true, sometimes identified with foreign goddesses—Egyptian, Asiatic, Colchian, or Iberianprobably because of her maidenly or warlike nature common to them with her; but we cannot say that her worship like that of Artemis or Dionysos, was tainted with Oriental or barbaric ideas, with orgiastic excess with impure symbolism or mystery . . . The tradition of Athena remained pure and clear in spite of the Alexandrine confusion of religions.

INTRODUCTION
T
he names Aqh'nai, Athens, and jAqhnaiva, Athena, have puzzled the curious for more than two millennia. Today orthodox scholars simply consider them to be pre-Hellenic. More imaginative or fanciful observers have proposed that the names are metatheses of Athena’s Canaanite counterpart ŒAnat or Athena’s Egyptian equivalent Nt or Nei\t (in Greek transcription).1 Athena’s identification with the latter was assumed by all ancient writers. In this chapter, I shall attempt to demonstrate that the names Athens and Athena both derive from H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt “temple or city” of the goddess Nt or Nei\t. In all my previous works, I had proposed an origin from simple H≥t Nt but criticisms from Dr. Arno Egberts, discussed below, have made me modify my position. All three forms H≥t Nt, H≥t-ntr Nt and H≥t-ntr nt Nt have been attested.2 Scholars debate whether Nt was originally Egyptian or Libyan, but the majority maintain that she was essentially Egyptian. A temple to Ne\it appears to have been founded at Sais near the beginning of



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 541
the First Dynasty.3 Nevertheless, she was worshipped in Libya at least since the Fifth Dynasty in the middle of the Third Millennium BCE. Two thousand years later, Herodotos and other Greek writers saw her as originating in Libya.4 Her cult center in Lower Egypt was at Sais near the western edge of the Nile Delta, an area which, at least in the early dynastic periods, was influenced by Libyan culture. The Greek belief that she was Libyan dates back to at least the sixth century BCE (see below). In the following century Herodotos claimed to have seen traces of the goddess’s origins in Libya.
SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER
This summary is only an outline of the chapter and it omits many of the topics considered in it. The chief concern of the chapter is with some of the striking parallels between the cults of Nei\t and Athena. It begins with a discussion of the importance of armor in both, and the striking similarities between their fetishes: for instance the shield with arrows of Nei\t and the Palladion of Athena. Peisistratos’ political use of a goodlooking young woman in armor on a chariot was identical to Libyan rituals dedicated to [Athena] in Libya. The chapter moves on to the central significance of weaving and embroidery and the presentation of a sacred cloth in both cults. The next section is concerned with fiery night festivals dedicated to the goddess in both Sais and Athens. Then follows a discussion of Athena’s enmity and identification with Medusa or the Gorgon and the association of the Gorgoneion or Gorgon face with burnt children’s bones from Second Millennium Knossos. I then consider the relationships among Ne–it, Athena and the ferocious Levantine goddess ŒAnat. This leads not only to the Semitic tradition of the sacrifice of the first born—which is symbolically central to the three monotheist religions Judaism, Christianity and Islam—but also to consideration of whether or not there were human sacrifices to the three goddesses. The possibility that the legendary fiery self-sacrifice of the woman pharaoh Nitokris was a surrogate for Ne–it is considered. Similarly, the question arises whether the legend of Dido’s incineration stands for the burning of Tanit, ŒAnat or Ne–it’s west Phoenician double. Were these legends used as etiological justifications for the actual “passing of children through the fire” in Canaanite-speaking cultures? In a new section, I weigh the claims, made by Egyptian priests to Diodoros Sikeliotes, that Athens had originally been an Egyptian colony.

I conclude that these have some merit and that the names of three of the early figures in Athenian history—Kekrops, Erekhtheus and Pete–s—have possible, or plausible, Egyptian etymologies. Leading from this discussion I speculate that there may have been a Middle Kingdom pre-Hyksos settlement in Attika. While later construction has obliterated any possible archaeological trace of this settlement in Athens, in her sister city Troizen ancient and strangely “un-Greek” columns have been found. I use the word “sister” here not only because of the tight mythological connections between the two cities but also because the Egyptian etymology for its name is TÅ Sn (the later Esna). TÅ Sn was the major cult center of Ne–it in Upper Egypt; Sais was the center in Lower Egypt. In Troizen, too, traditions hint at a pre-Hyksos foundation with strong Egyptian connections. The following sections are concerned with Egyptian etymologies of some toponyms within Athens and other names, such as Parthenon and Gorgon, associated with the cult of Athena. There is also a discussion of Ne–it as a divinity of the sky, her veil as clouds and Athena’s blue eyes as both resembling the sky and indicating her ferocity. Finally, I discuss the Egyptian etymology of the name Athena for which there is no Indo-European alternative. In response to convincing criticisms I have changed my opinions on this derivation. Previously, I derived the name from H≥t Nt “temple of Ne–it” and the religious title of her cult center, the secular name of which was Sais. I have now shifted to deriving the name from H≥t ntr (nt) Nt, which is also attested and for which H≥t Nt may have sometimes been an abbreviation. I conclude by arguing that any problems remaining with the phonetics of the equation are overwhelmed by the semantic identification backed by the mass of parallels between the two goddesses and their cities as outlined in this chapter.
ARMOR AND EQUIPMENT
Herodotus wrote: “It is evident, I think, that the Greeks took the ‘aegis’ with which they adorn statues of Athena from the dress of Libyan women: the only difference being that the latter is of leather and has fringes of leather thongs instead of snakes.”5 “Aegis” in the sense of “storm cloud” will be discussed below. Here I merely want to consider it as a garment. It would seem to be depicted in the hieroglyph that was one form of the
sign g (Aa20). The other form had tassles.6 Gardiner listed the sign as



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 543
“unclassified” but both forms could be plausibly explained as a human covering with shoulder straps, either a dress or a corslet, neither of which has any known determinative. The distinction between armor and dress is not so great as it might appear. Although bronze plate armor was known in the eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age, most armor in the region was made of leather or bronze chain mail based on cloth or was simply thickly wadded linen. The association with tassels was maintained throughout Egyptian history. By the Eighteenth Dynasty, the hieroglyph that appears to have had the phonetic value Œpr was used with the meaning “a type of tassel presented to a god.” In the Ptolemaic pe
riod g in conjunction with a determinative for “cloth” meant “garment.” The semantic range of Œpr, however, was much wider. It had the general sense of “equip, outfit, make ready.” In the plural Œprw it meant equipment—especially of a ship. It was extended to mean “crew.”
Confirmation that g does signify “corslet” comes from an almost identical ideogram found on Linear B tablets at Knossos; it clearly has this meaning.7 Such correspondences between the two writing system are extremely rare. One reason for this particular parallel could be that this type of armor arrived in the Aegean after the formation of the local script. Hence, the Egyptian sign was introduced with the object it represented. This possibility is made more likely by the similarities between the two signs for chariots that arrived in the eastern Mediterranean at about the same time as chain mail.8 The phonetic value of the Aegean sign for armor is unknown. The root hopl- found in o{plon, more often found in the plural form o{pla “heavy arms, armour, ship’s tackle,” and in oJplivzw “to make ready, equip” are attested in Hesiod and Homer but are absent from Linear B. This form would seem a likely candidate for the sound. Whether or not this is the case, it would seem plausible to derive hopl- from Œpr. As has been discussed above, the vocalization of Œain in both Egyptian and Semitic was usually with the back vowels/o/and /u/.9 Thus it would seem legitimate to postulate tentatively a middle Egyptian *Œo/upl. In this case the only phonetic problem would be with the initial h- in Greek. The ease and frequency of this alternation has been discussed in earlier chapters. The standard Indo-European etymologies can explain the initial h- but not the final consonant -l. According to these explanations, hopla is derived from one or other of two verbs, e{pw and e{pomai. The first of these supposedly comes from a root *sep attested in the Sanskrit sapati “worship, tend.” The second certainly derives from *sekw, which is seen in the



544 BLACK ATHENA
Latin sequor “follow, accompany.” In both cases neither the phonetic nor the semantic correspondences approach the accuracy of those of the Egyptian Œpr with hopla.
The Palladion
Even stronger evidence for the two goddesses’ ancient identity comes from hoplolatry, the worship of armed shields. One of the oldest cultic symbols in Egyptian civilization is the sign of Nei\t. This fetish stood on a pole. Originally, the figure seems to have been a species of beetle, Agrypnus notodonta. Soon, however, the beetle merged with the figure of an oval or hourglass shield with incurving sides across which lay crossed arrows. This representation remained the chief symbol of Nei\t for the next three thousand years.10 Forms of the shield and arrows were found on stelae and memorials for the second pharaoh of the First Dynasty Œh and a queen of his called Nt H≥ tpw, as well as for another queen or princess Mr Nt.11 Symbols of this type continued in the Old Kingdom. By the Saite period, however, the shape of the shield had changed to conform with military practice; it became a much broader straight-sided form with a curved top. With this modification, the shield represented Sais until Roman times.12 Primarily, however, it was the symbol or fetish of the goddess herself.13 In 1906, Percy Newberry pointed out that the Egyptian sign was essentially the same as the Minoan figure-eight shield.14 The many representations of this extremely common Cretan sign make it clear that the shield was supposed to have been made from dappled oxhide, very much as the early Egyptian ones were. Although the symbol, which clearly had religious significance, occurred in earlier periods, Sir Arthur Evans, the excavator of Knossos, pointed out that “few representations of such shields can be found earlier than the closing phase of the Middle Minoan Period.”15 The beginning of the Middle Minoan III, circa 1730 BCE, is the date for which the Hyksos invasion is postulated by the Revised Ancient Model. From the same period or later comes an engraved amethyst seal showing a figure-8 shield surmounted by a helmet. It is uncertain, however, whether this engraving represents a person, a divinity or divine weapons.16 Later, but even more significant, is a painted limestone tablet from Mycenae; it shows a divinity, behind a figure-8 shield, being worshipped. The head is not preserved, but the white coloring of the limbs indicates, following the Egyptian convention, that the figure was female, i.e., a god



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 545
dess. Martin Nilsson, H.L. Lorimer and other scholars did not hesitate to link the “shield goddess” to Athena and her symbol the Palladion.17 The appearance of this object is uncertain. Apollodoros described it: “three cubits in height, its feet were joined together; in its right hand it held a spear aloft and in the other a distaff and a spindle.”18 It is generally agreed to have been made of wood. Miss Lorimer, basing her opinion on a vase painting, wrote: “it may even have come down in unbroken descent from that of the figure-of-eight shield, as depicted on the LHIII limestone tablet from Mycenae; for to hang a shield on a log or tree trunk and even to give the latter a few human traits would not be beyond the powers of a proto-geometric worshipper.”19 Some traditions held that the Palladion fell from heaven into the temple of Athena at Troy before its roof was built. After the Trojan War, it was supposed to have been taken from there to Athens or, according to Latin authors, to Rome.20 Despite some associations with Zeus, the Palladion, according to ancient and modern authorities, represented Pallas Athena. It was centrally important in her cult, particularly at Athens. As Nilsson put it, “Her effigy, the Palladion was in an inner palace as a pledge ensuring the survival of the city.”21 Sir Arthur Evans linked the sign of Nei\t to the Palladion, through the Minoan Shields and the Mycenaean Shield Goddess. As far as I am aware, he has been the only scholar to do so. Nevertheless, each link in his chain of connections seems to have the support of the scholars concerned.22
Beautiful young women in armor
The Egyptian toponym ŒPr is difficult to place. Gauthier saw one instance as a sanctuary of Osiris near Memphis and another as purely mythical.23 However, the late, fourth century BCE, Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys appears to use the name to refer to the city of Sais.24 Herodotos used a derivative of hopla when he described the worship of Athena by a Libyan tribe:
They hold an annual festival in honour of Athene, at which the girls divide themselves into two groups and fight each other. Before setting them to fight, they pick out the best looking girl and dress her up publicly in a full suit of Greek armour [panoplie] and a Corinthian helmet, then they put her in a chariot and drive her around the lagoon. How they dressed these girls before there were



546 BLACK ATHENA
Greeks settled in the neighbourhood, I cannot say; presumably the armour they used was Egyptian—for I am prepared to maintain that both shields and helmets were introduced into Greece from Egypt.25
Herodotos would seem to be right in deriving the title Aigis from aix, aigos “goat,” thus indicting leather protection.26 On the other hand, Œpr / hopla and panoplia would all seem to refer to armor, plate, chain mail, and padded linen. A survival of this early form for religious purposes would explain the remarkable “linen corslet” [qwvrhka livneon] sent to the Temple of Athena at Lindos on Rhodes by the pharaoh Amasis.27 Amasis was the last major ruler of the Twenty-sixth or Saite Dynasty. During his long reign, 570–526 BCE, he embellished his capital Sais and the temple of Nei\t in particular.28 This pharaoh had close contact with Greeks as mercenaries and traders and concentrated them in a settlement at Naukratis near Sais. Furthermore, his promotion of his goddess was extended to Greece. He sent the linen corslet with two statues of Athena to her temple at Lindos, which was, after Athens, the goddess’s greatest cult center, supposedly founded by Danaos himself. In the middle of the sixth century Lindos was ruled by Kleobolos one of the “seven sages” of Greece and a friend of Solon. Like Solon, Kleobolos was supposed to have studied in Egypt.29 Amasis’ religious activities in Greece were not restricted to the cult of Ne–it /Athena. He sent statues of himself to the temple of Hera at Samos, but he did this, as Herodotos plausibly argued, because of his alliance and friendship with the Samian tyrant Polykrates. His two outstanding gifts seem to have been the linen corslet for Athena at Lindos and a goldplated statue of Ne–it/Athena presented to the Greek colony of Cyrene on the Libyan coast, the territory where Herodotos placed the center of her cult.30 Another cult object offered by Amasis never reached its destination. A linen corslet sent to Sparta was captured by Samian pirates. Herodotos described it:
it was of linen, embroidered with gold thread and cotton, and had a number of figures of animals woven into the fabric. The most remarkable thing about it was that each fine thread of which the material was woven was made up of three hundred and sixty separate strands, all distinctly visible. Similar to it was the corslet which Amasis presented to the temple of Athena at Lindos.31



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 547
This type of work seems similar to the polymitos “multi threaded” gowns in which Aiskhylos dressed the Egyptian daughters of Danaos in The Suppliants.32 Homeric heroes like Ajax were supposed to have worn linen corslets.33 Whatever their precise nature, there is very little doubt as to where Amasis’ presents were woven. Like Athena, Ne–it was believed to have invented weaving.34 Both Egyptian and Greek sources refer to the religious workshops attached to her temple at Sais where fine materials were woven for sacred use.35 As the nineteenth-century classicist and Egyptologist D. Mallet pointed out, the woven clothes bore a strong resemblance to the pevplo" “cover, outfit or dress” presented to the image of Athena, which was woven over a period of nine months by aristocratic maidens under the supervision of a priestess.36 According to Plato and other writers, the peplos was brightly colored and contained representations of mythical scenes, in particular that of Athena’s struggle with, and victory over, Asterios, otherwise known as the Minotaur.37 The idea of offering Athena an embroidered dress, possibly with metallic threads, is clearly much older than the sixth century. Many fragmentary representations show women presenting colored cloth (at least once with a fringe) to a “priestess or epiphany of the goddess.”38 In the Iliad, Hekabe, queen of Troy, presents Athena with a richly embroidered peplos which “shone like a star”; it was woven by Sidonian women. An aristocratic priestess placed it on the knees of her statue.39 A seventhcentury figure of a woman or female divinity whose dress had five panels of embroidered scenes, found at Francavilla in southern Italy, has been plausibly attributed to Athena.40 As can be seen from the frieze on the Parthenon, the presentation of the peplos to the goddess was the central feature of the greatest Athenian festival, the Panatheneia. In classical times the form of the quadrennial festival was the result of reforms carried out in 566 BCE probably under the influence of Peisistratos. The degree of his responsibility for these reforms is debated but he did promote and use the cult of Athena and, to a lesser extent, that of Dionysos, whose Egyptian equivalent Osiris was also worshipped at Sais.41 Peisistratos and his son Hippias enlarged Athena’s temples and from the 540s the number of statues dedicated to her increased. This activity can be linked, with a fair degree of certainty, to Amasis’ wealth, prestige and promotion of the cult of Nei\t/Athena. Apart from their contemporaneity, two pieces of evidence point to a belief in the goddess’ Libyan origins. For the Greeks of this period Libya



548 BLACK ATHENA
referred to the territory now known as such but also to the whole continent of Africa. The tetradrachms issued by Peisistratos, the first to show a head of Athena, portrayed her in such a way that she could be taken as an African Black.42 It was this coin that inspired the title Black Athena.43 Libyan influence can also be seem in Herodotos’ description of one of the tactics the tyrant used to gain power:
In the village of Paeania there was a handsome woman called Phye, nearly six feet tall, whom they fitted out in a suit of armour [panoplie] and mounted in a chariot; then after getting her to pose in the most striking attitude, they drove into Athens, where messengers . . . were already . . . talking to the people and urging them to welcome Pisistratos back because the goddess Athene herself had shown him extraordinary honour and was bringing him home.44
This street theater strikingly resembled Herodotos’ description (given above) of the Libyan custom of dressing a beautiful girl in armor and setting her on a chariot to represent Athena. Thus, in this case too something of religious significance was apparently taking place. It is true that Herodotos reported the Libyan ritual a century later and by that time it seems to have contained Greek influence. Equally, however, there is no reason to doubt that the ritual was part of a much older tradition. Oric Bates demonstrated elaborately and conclusively the parallels between the Libyan “Athena” and Ne–it.45 Furthermore, the same word ojlolughv “chant” or “ululation” that Herodotos ascribed to Libyan women in her cult was made by the Trojan women praying to Athena in the Iliad.46 While it could be argued the Libyan influence came to Athens from the Greek colony at Cyrene, we know that Athenians were not involved in the colonization so such influence seems unlikely.47Thus either the Libyans and Peisistratos shared an ancient tradition or the sixth-century Athenians learned about the cult of the Libyan Ne–it through Sais or the treaty port of Naukratis, which Amasis granted to Greek traders. Some scholars have maintained that the introduction of the first Attic coins portraying the “Black” Athena was connected to the reform of the Panatheneia. Whether or not they are right to claim that these coins were first struck to pay victors in the festival’s competitions, there is no doubt that the two innovations were part of the general promotion of the cult of the Athena.48 Equally, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Peisistratos’ religious activities were influenced by the contemporaneous rituals of Amasis.



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 549
Cloth and cloud
Apart from her general associations with weaving, Nei\t too was specifically connected to a peplos. Plutarch quoted the inscription beneath her statue in Sais according to which her peplos could never be lifted by a mortal.49 Proklos, in his translation of the same inscription two centuries later, however, used the word khito\n.50 Mallet accounted for this difference by the fact that a papyrus of the Saite period uses two synonyms when expressing the same idea. In the inscription the deceased asked Ne–it to take off her snh≥w “binding, garment” even though she had never removed her qris “garment.”51 The latter word is obscure but it seems to be related to qri “storm cloud.”52 This corresponds neatly with the meaning of “aegis”; both Zeus and Athena had an aegis and both signified “garment, storm cloud.” Aiskhylos and others used aegis in this sense and the verb kataigivzw means “to pour down rain.”53 The double sense, or paronomasia, of aijgiv" apparently comes from the conflation of two etyma: the Indo-European aix “goat or buck” and the Egyptian igp “storm cloud” or as a verb “to be overcast.” Although the Egyptian word retained the final -p right down to the Coptic khe\pe, final -ps were lost in loans into Greek and the semantic fit is perfect.54 This links the garment or veil to Ne–it’s function as a goddess of the upper sky and weather, which was part of her later cult at least. Diodoros identified Athena with the air and Diogenes of Babylon specified the ether or upper air.55 The Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry, of the third century CE, reported that, according to Orpheus, Kore–[the maid] was represented as a weaver and the ancients said that the sky was a peplos and the “cloak for the heavenly gods.”56 The association with clouds and weather leads to the possibility that both the late cult of the nautical Isis (whose cult absorbed that of Nei\t) and her successor the sailing Virgin Mary derived from the Saitian cult of Nei\t.57 Such associations would fit well with the nautical treatment of the Athenian peplos in the Panatheneia. It was conveyed to the Acropolis on the model of a ship mounted on wheels with a crew of priests and priestesses wearing colorful clothes and garlands.58 Transporting a cult object on a ship carried by bearers was a common feature of Egyptian religious ritual.59 This combination of dress-armor and a ship and its tackle and crew also occurs in the semantic ranges of both Œpr and hopla or the English words “equipment” and “outfit.” Peplos could derive from *pÅ Œpr “the Œpr.” In this case, however, the conventional Indo-European



550 BLACK ATHENA
etymology from a reduplication of a root *pl “fold” appears equally likely.60 If the Panetheneia of classical times showed Egyptian influence, how much, if any, of this came before the sixth century? There seems no reason to doubt the implication of two lines in the Catalogue of Ships, one of the oldest sections of the Iliad, that there was a major festival to Athena at Athens.61 Skeptics have claimed the lines were interpolated but they have failed to prove their case and the onus is on them to do so.62 It is also known that early statues of Athena were clothed. Thus, although there is no proof, an ancient ceremony was probably associated with her covering.63 The antiquity of the Panathenaia would seem plausible, given the Athenians’ reputation for religious traditionalism and the city’s cultural continuity through the “Dark Age.” As superb politicians, Peisistratos and his friends would have been unlikely to introduce too many cultic innovations into such a conservative society. It must be admitted, however, that according to the Ancient Model they could have brought in new rituals from Egypt on the grounds stated by Plato in the Timaeus that in the Nile Valley ancient Athenian customs had been better preserved than in Greece itself.64 In Hellenistic times there was no doubt that the Panatheneia was thought to be very old indeed. Its foundation was attributed to Athena and Hephaistos or to Theseus or to all three.65 The association with the last is made more plausible by the festival’s theme: Athena’s struggle with, and victory over, the Titan or giant Asterios. Mythographers link Asterios to Crete and the Minotaur. Thus, as J. A. Davison has suggested, the “political” theme may well have been Theseus’ achievement of Athenian independence from Crete.66 Indeed, as has been argued above, the impulse for the reforms of the Panatheneia and other aspects of the cult of Athena could have possibly come from the prestige of Ne–it’s city Sais and her promotion by Amasis. Thus, Egyptian elements could have been introduced at this time. Nevertheless, it would seem wiser to accept conventional wisdom and assume that the major changes in the sixth century were the introduction of athletic and musical competitions. In this interpretation, the Athenians seem to have followed the pattern of the Olympic and the recently established Pythian, Isthmaian and Nemean games. Furthermore, possibly as a result of the influence of these games, the Panatheneia may have been turned from an annual festival to a quadrennial one. Georgio de Santillana has suggested, however, that the Olympic quadrennial sys



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 551
tem may have come from the Egyptian calendar’s tetraeteris.67 We know that in the seventh century citizens of Elis consulted Pharaoh Psametikhos on the proper management of the Olympic Games.68 In any event, such an interpretation would leave as the ancient features precisely those elements that were most Egyptian: the peplos, its conveyance by “ship,” and the all night festival with its lights and “fire dancing” in armor (discussed below). All of these could well date to Mycenaean times. In conjunction with the padded armor, these ancient features seem to provide a link between Ne–it and Athena that can most plausibly be seen as originating in the Bronze Age.
Fire festival
Another element of the Panatheneia is similar to the cult of Ne–it at Sais as described by Herodotos:
At Sais, on the night of sacrifices, everybody burns a great number of lights in the open air around the houses; the lamps they use are flat dishes filled with oil and salt, with a floating wick which keep burning throughout the night. The festival is called the Festival of Lamps (lucnokaivh) and even the Egyptians who cannot attend it mark the night of sacrifice by lighting lamps, so that on that night lamps are burning not in Sais only but throughout the country.69
Although there was more than one festival of this type and their dates seem to have varied, texts in Egyptian and Greek translation confirm the nature of this nocturnal celebration.70 Alan Lloyd in his commentary on this book of Herodotos identified the flat dish lamp as Gardiner’s
sign z (R7). The issue is clearly very complicated, as the sign does not represent a dish and Gardiner himself saw it as an incense bowl with smoke rising from it.71 Despite the similarity to the Indo-European root *leuk “light,” the Greek word lykhnos “torch, lamp” was at least “contaminated” by the Egyptian rqh≥ “light, festival of burning.” This word was later written rkh, rok–h or lok–h in Coptic, at least it was when the Greek word was used to describe the Saitian festivals.72 Alan Lloyd writes that the Greek period terracotta statuettes found in Egypt representing Athena/Ne–it and holding a torch were “quite unGk.”73 Many Greek rituals associated with Athena, however, involved torches used at night. The Panatheneia seems to have begun with an



552 BLACK ATHENA
all-night festival in which runners carrying torches raced to light the flame on the goddess’ altar.74 Similar torch-lit races were held in Athena’s honor at Marathon and Corinth. At Eleusis and elsewhere, lamps were lit in all-night vigils.75 There were also the Purricivstai: “fire-dancing men who, as can be seen in a relief from the Akropolis, danced in hoplite armor.76 Thus, these festivals emphasize once again that armor was a pervasive element in the cults of both Ne–it and Athena. Their dance seems to have been a celebration of Athena’s defeat of the Titan Asterios. Plato also mentioned that this theme was woven into the Peplos.77
ATHENA AND HER VICTIMS
Asterios not only had connections with Crete but was also clearly divine, being linked to Zeus and identified with the Minotaur. He was possibly connected to ŒAstar, the Semitic god of Venus as the Morning Star. ŒAstar’s better known female double ŒAstarte, the goddess of love and beauty, seems to have been the divinity of the evening star.78 This ambiguity might explain the alternative Greek tradition that Athena’s victim was the “queen” Medusa or Gorgon, hence her epithet Gorgophona “Gorgon slayer.” Like her favorite Perseus, Athena used the Gorgon’s head as a weapon and incorporated its fearsome power. Her use of the monster’s face on her armor can be dated back to Homer and far beyond.79 Despite the fact that many nineteenth-century classicists passionately denied any fundamental relationship between pure, “rational” Athena and the savage Gorgon, they, in fact, share many similarities.80 Thereby, the confusion is compounded. Like the goddess, Medusa was a queen of Libya. Athena’s doublet Pallas also was queen of Libya and was supposed to have been killed by Athena, who then, according to some traditions, took from Pallas the symbol of the Palladion.81
Children’s bones
A 1978 discovery provides another link between Athena and the Shield Goddess. In a room outside the palace of Knossos pots containing children’s bones were found. The dating is not altogether clear; Peter Warren saw the pots as dating to the ceramic period Middle Minoan III, 1730–1675 BCE.82 C. Lambrou-Phillipson, however, places them in the Late Minoan, after 1675 BCE.83 The children’s bones were scared by



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 553
knife marks, marks associated with a cooking pot. These have led the excavator Peter Warren to propose that child sacrifice and cannibalism had taken place there. The discovery of a white steatite scarab of the Second Intermediate period in the same room provides a loose connection with Egypt.84 No religious images were found near the bones but a miniature amphora with cultic associations and decorated with figure-8 shields was discovered. Still more remarkable is a unique pot decorated with three motifs: A Gorgoneion or Gorgon’s face has what appears to be a tuft of hair at the top. Second, the same shape appears without a face; possibly it portrays the back of the head. Third is the figure-8 shield.85 This pot illustrates a Bronze Age identification of Athena with Medusa and overthrows the separation between the two maintained by nineteenthand twentieth-century scholars who wanted to keep Athena “pure and rational.”86 Evidence from Canaanite culture would seem to suggest that the tufts were to be used to hold and attach the head.87 According to Pausanias, however, at Tegea in Arkadia a lock of the Gorgon’s hair was used to protect the city. In his discussion of this passage Frazer uses analogies to indicate that exposure of a lock of hair was thought to bring on thunderstorms and, thus, leads back to the aegis as a thunder cloud.88 The discovery at Knossos confirms that—as with many Greek gods, notably Artemis, Poseidon and Dionysos—Athena was associated with human, and especially child, sacrifice, and that the practice continued in the Iron Age.89 A Hellenistic story tells of girls throwing themselves off the Akropolis in suspiciously ritual circumstances. According to Tzetzes, writing in the twelfth century CE, Lokrian girls were sent to the Trojan shore to atone for the desecration of Athena’s temple in Troy; there they were murdered and their bones burnt in a special way, indicating a sacrifice.90 The origin of the festival of Hellotia was explained in terms of a legend in which a maiden was burnt to death in the temple of Athena at Corinth.91 Clear evidence of human sacrifice to Athena can be found at Salamis in Cyprus. Most authorities believe the sacrifices to have been derived from a Mycenaean cult.92
ŒAnat
Another possibility is that the Cypriot cult was linked to that of Athena’s Canaanite counterpart, ŒAnat, who must have been the “Athena,” the goddess to whom a virgin was sacrificed every year. ŒAnat was the extraordinarily bloodthirsty warrior goddess of the West Semites. Her name

has been found in Amorite as well as in texts from Mari, dating back to the beginning of the Second Millennium.93 She is not, however, present in either the Mesopotamia or the Eblaite panthea.94 Much ingenuity has been spent in trying, with very little success, to find an etymology from the semitic roots Œyn “spring,” Œny “submit,” Œnh “answer” and Œnn “cloud” as well as from a hypothetical *Œnt “omen, time.”95 It would seem more plausible, given her relatively late arrival and the regions where she was worshipped, to derive the name from Nt. Phonetically, there is a difficulty with the initial Œayin in ŒAnat. Many examples of Œain softening to >aleph occur in Semitic languages, although the reverse is less frequent. A prothetic >aleph, often unrecorded in the script, was quite common in Egyptian.96 Furthermore, if we can accept the latest research on the subject—which derives the name of ŒAnat’s West Phoenician equivalent, TNT, from ŒAnat—the Œayin has disappeared or was never there.97 The equivalence with Nei\t is strengthened by the possibility that the second /i/ found in the late vocalized forms Tinnit, or Tannit, was not a secondary development but original.98 Against this, however, must be set Gordon’s conviction that the pronunciation of the Levantine title was ŒAnat(i), though a metathesis *ŒAnait would be possible here.99 The possibility that the name ŒAnat derived from Nei\t is not weakened by the fact that the Semitic goddess was worshipped in Egypt as Œ-n-ta or ŒA-na-ta. There is no reason why she should not have been reintroduced into Egypt especially as her cult is always associated with Semitic speakers. The first attestation of the name is in the Hyksos period, when important Hyksos leader was called ŒAnat H≥r.100 The next appearance of the cult of Œ-n-ta appeared in the Nineteenth Dynasty, which in some respects consciously based itself on Hyksos traditions.101 At an even later period, it is striking that when “Jews” were placed in Elephantine during the Twenty-sixth or Saite Dynasty, the colonists called their goddess ŒAnat. The city’s official cult was of Ne–it. Whether or not the two names are related there are many striking parallels between the two deities. They combined being mighty and cruel warriors with a tender loving quality. They were both endowed with renewable virginity. Both were associated with bows and hunting and, like Ne–it and her vulture, ŒAnat was identified with a bird of prey, the eagle. Furthermore, both goddesses have celestial aspects.102 Given the links between Ne–it and Athena mentioned above, one would expect to find parallels between the latter and ŒAnat. Interestingly, however, Theodore Gaster prefers to see similarities between the Levantine



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 555
goddess and Artemis.103 As F. O. Hvidberg-Hansen has demonstrated, Athena shared many of ŒAnat’s characteristics. Others, however, such as the Levantine goddess’ association with mountains and the sparagmos (the ritual tearing apart and eating of a young male victim), are not.104 Furthermore, as Hvidberg-Hansen has pointed out, there are joint dedications to ŒAnat’s and her West Phoenician double Tanit and to Artemis.105 Such evidence does not, however, preclude the identification of ŒAnat with Athena. There is no reason why the Greek goddesses, who resembled each other in many ways, should not both have been associated with ŒAnat. In fact, while there is no attestation of a direct parallel between ŒAnat and Artemis, there are some between the Semitic goddess and Athena. Philo of Byblos writing in the first century CE but using much earlier sources, including some from the Bronze Age, identified the two.106 In Corinth a late source identifies as Phoenician the Athena with whom a sacrifice is associated.107 In the Cypriot cults at Lapithos and Idalion, the local goddess was worshipped as ŒAnat in Phoenician and Athena in Greek.108 Thus in First Millennium Cyprus, which in so many ways preserved Aegean Bronze Age culture, the two goddesses were clearly identified. This attestation would seem to indicate a much older historical stratum than those connecting Tanit and Artemis. The three-way correspondence Ne–it-Athena-ŒAnat might be able to cast some light on the gruesome finds at Knossos. Although there is no direct parallel between Athena and ŒAnat, the latter’s joint struggle with her brother god BaŒal against an aquatic monster strongly suggests an indirect parallel. Fontenrose pointed out the similarities between Athena’s partnership with Perseus and that between ŒAnat and BaŒal. The Greek pair fight a sea monster off the coast of present-day Palestine, but they are also involved in the struggle with, and slaughter of, the Libyan Gorgon Medusa. Fontenrose also showed how in different Canaanite legends ŒAnat appears on both sides of the struggle.109 As mentioned above, the Gorgon can be seen both as Athena’s victim and as her double whose head or skinned face the goddess put on her armor to gain its fearful power. Although the tradition that she flayed her victim was strong in classical times, the portrayal of what appear to be the backs of heads on the gorgoneion pithos suggests that, in this case at least, the goddess was seen as suspending whole heads.110 Also, it is possible that at an early stage of the Greek legend more than one head was involved. Tradition referred to three hideous gorgons, although only one was supposed to have been beheaded. There is also a curious couplet



556 BLACK ATHENA
of dubious authenticity in Hesiod’s “The Shield of Herakles.” It concerns Perseus’ outfit and Frazer translated it:
But all his back had on the head of a dread monster, The Gorgon, and around him ran the Kibisis.111
Kibivsi" is usually translated “pouch” or “wallet” but it is only used in connection with this legend of Perseus. Lewy’s derivation of it from the Canaanite qibus`“collection, assemblage” (known from modern Israel) with the meaning of “chaplet, string of heads” would explain its qualities of surrounding and enveloping. Whether or not this is the case, the design on the pithos parallels these Ugaritic verses:
But Anath gives battle Mightily she cuts in pieces the sons of two cities Beneath her are heads like balls, Over her are palms of hands like locusts . . . She hangs heads on her back, She fastens hands on her girdle.112
This, as many scholars have noted, is one of the most striking resemblances between ŒAnat and the Hindu goddess Kali. This relationship seems as likely as its nature is obscure.113 The parallel between ŒAnat and Athena might also throw some light on one of the latter’s victimsAsterios. In the Ugaritic epic of BaŒal and ŒAnat, ŒAttar the terrible is supposed to have usurped the throne of BaŒal after the latter was killed by Mot “Death.” ŒAttar is then supposed to have retired to rule earth because of his inadequacy.114 His enmity to BaŒal is unquestionable and, while there is no specific reference to his having been killed by ŒAnat, this was the general fate of BaŒal’s enemies.
Lucifer ŒAstarte
William Albright described the conflict between BaŒal and his usurper, the morning star, and plausibly linked it to what he saw as a Canaanite myth quoted in the Book of Isaiah.
How hast thou fallen from heaven, Helel alone of Shahar [dawn].



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 557
Thou didst say in My heart, I will ascend to heavan, Above the circumpolar stars (kokabê El)115
This, of course, can be linked to the legends of Satan, whose biname is Lucifer (lightbearer) or Morning Star, as the usurping and fallen angel.116 The most elaborate exposition of these legends came in the Book of Enoch, which, although written in the last two centuries BCE, clearly contains very old elements. In passages from this book, the fallen watchers, angels or stars copulate with cows and are themselves generally associated with oxen.117 The association of sex, beauty, cattle and the stars is clearly both ancient and fundamental in Near Eastern mythology. In Egypt the goddess Hathor combined all these elements. Albright has even attempted to link her name to ŒAttar and ŒAstarte.118 The same cluster, with the more sinister connotations found in Canaanite culture, appears in legends attested in Third Millennium Mesopotamia. According to this legend cluster, the beautiful but deadly goddess Istar, whose planet was Venus, was rebuffed by the hero Gilgamesh, because she had killed and eaten her previous lovers. In her anger she persuaded her divine parents to create a monstrous heavenly bull which Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu fought and killed.119 The Greek myths tell of Pasiphai, “shining for all,” copulating with a bull and giving birth to the Minotaur-Asterios. This stellar bull and his Egyptian origins from the bull-headed god Mont will be discussed later. The myth of the Minotaur fought and killed by Theseus and Ariadne, or Athena, clearly belongs to this cluster. The idea that the female monster was in some way Istar, goddess of beauty, would explain the paradoxical descriptions of the loveliness of the Gorgon given by both Pindar and Pausanias.120 In general, however, she was considered to be fiendishly ugly. ŒAttar’s Ugaritic epithet “the terrible” could well refer to his appearance. It may relate to his counterpart Istar-ŒAstarte’s proclivities. It may also refer to his cult. If the description by Pseudo-Nilos of a fourth century CE Arab rite is genuine, it is likely that sparagmos—the tearing apart and eating of a perfect young man—was a very ancient practice. The sacrifice was dedicated to the Morning Star, ŒAttar to the south Arabs but the goddess Istar/ŒAstarte to other Semitic speakers. These identifications link the cult to the goddess’s habits to which Gilgamesh objected.121



558 BLACK ATHENA
In Greek legends the cult of the Minotaur (Asterios) also involved sacrifice of perfect youth, the seven youths and seven maidens sent to Crete from Athens.122 Thus there was no doubt about the terrible nature of Athena’s transsexual victim/double, Asterios/Gorgon Relating ŒAnat to the Shield Goddess provides insight into the child sacrifice at Knossos. It must be insisted, however, that this ritual does not appear to have been sparagmos, although ŒAnat was clearly involved. As a chilling Ugaritic verse, quoted earlier, puts it:
She ate his flesh, without a knife, She drank his blood without a cup.123
In Peter Warren’s find, although there are some signs of cannibalism and it is possible that the flesh was not burnt, the bones had certainly been cut. Thus it may be that, despite Pseudo-Nilus’ report, sparagmos was only an ideal and cutting was, in fact, necessary. On the other hand, the clear association with fire raises the possibility that another type of sacrifice may have been at least partially involved. The killing of children with knives and the burning of their bodies on a sacred fire seems to have been an important, if not the most important, sacrifice for Canaanite speakers. In Carthage and other sites in the western Mediterranean, abundant archaeological evidence shows that this rite was practiced frequently. Archaeological evidence indicates that this form of child sacrifice increased over the centuries at Carthage. Two plausible reasons can be offered for this increase. The first is common to many societies: sacrifice increases when a society sees itself as threatened. In the case of Carthage ancient authors attest to this.124 The second reason is less certain, but apparently the sacrifice increased with the rise of democracy or citizen participation. Nevertheless, as in nearly all other respects, notably language, western Phoenicia preserved ancient cultural features lost in the east. So we have no reason to doubt that the ritual was carried out in the Levant, too, at an earlier date. As the name of the sacrifice MLK, the same root as that for malk “king” suggests, the sacrifice tended to be reserved for royalty and other leaders who showed their commitment to the community through the ritual.125 As Philo of Byblos wrote in the second century CE: “It was the custom among the ancients, when great dangers befell [them], that to avoid complete destruction, the rulers of the city or the people, should give over to slaughter the most beloved of their children as a ransom to the vengeful daimons. And those given over were slain with mystic rites.”126



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 559
At the beginning of the twentieth century, R.A.S Macalister discovered a tophet, that is a cemetery of jars containing the bones of infants; it was next to a sacred “High Place” at Gezer in Palestine. Many scholars have criticized this find. No doubt Macalister made some major stratigraphical errors. On the other hand, given the undoubted embarrassment such a discovery brings to the origins of Judaism and Christianity, it is not surprising that scholars committed to these faiths, who dominate “biblical” archaeology, should be reluctant to accept his findings.127 Even without any archaeological evidence from the Levant, the case that this type of sacrifice took place there is overwhelming. In addition to the finds in western Phoenicia, reports from Ugaritic, as well as classical sources and above all biblical texts make it abundantly clear that sacrifice of the first born, in emergencies, was practiced at the very least in Israel, Moab and Phoenicia.
Sacrifice of the first born
Thus, it is likely that at some stage, all Canaanite speakers practiced child sacrifice. At a symbolic level it survives in the centrality of sacrifice or the yåhîd, or in Greek monogénos, “only begotten son/child,” notably Isaac, Jesus and Ishmael in the three great monotheist religions that derive from this tradition.128 Another distinctive feature of the rite’s symbolism was the substitution of a sheep for the sacrificial child: the ram caught in a thicket, the Lamb of God and the sheep and goats sacrificed at Arafat during the Haj to celebrate Abraham’s offering his son there. This substitution is also found in the legend of the Golden Fleece; Zeus sends the ram to replace Phrixos the son that King Athamas was about to sacrifice.129 Archaeologically, the bones of sheep have been found mixed with those of children in the tophet of Carthage. Much later stelae from Ngaus in Algeria specify that a lamb was sacrificed instead of a child.130 It is interesting, therefore, to find sheep bones with the human remains at Knossos.131 To whom were the Canaanite child sacrifices dedicated? The documentary evidence points to a number of male gods of states or cities: Yahweh, Khemosh, Melqart and El. The only direct evidence of this kind of child sacrifice to a goddess in the Levant is a reference to one for “Athena” at Laodicea in Syria.132 Nevertheless a powerful case can be made that during the Second Millennium the children were offered to



560 BLACK ATHENA
ŒAnat. First is the evidence of ŒAnat’s extraordinarily sanguinary nature. René Dussaud and other scholars have linked this nature to west Phoenician child sacrifices to Tanit.133 Stelae associated with children’s bones at Carthage are dedicated to “Tanit face of Baal.” Given the known conservatism of west Phoenicia and the identification of Tanit with ŒAnat, which F. O. Hvidberg-Hansen has brought to near certainty, it is extremely likely that some early Canaanite child sacrifices were dedicated to ŒAnat either alone or in association with a male god.134 The evidence from pre-Hellenic possibly west Semitic-speaking, Knossos fits well here. If child sacrifices were dedicated to Athena and ŒAnat, is there any evidence to connect Nei\t to this practice? There is some, although it is only indirect. While it is often difficult to draw a line between secular and religious killing, human sacrifice was practiced relatively frequently in Egypt; foreigners were usually the victims.135 The practice has not, however, been attested specifically in connection with Nei\t. On the other hand, we know that the goddess was worshipped in nocturnal mysteries that frequently took place in hidden or subterranean chambers.136 More significant are the stories concerning Queen Nitokris. This legendary figure appears to have been based on the historic queen, Nt ˆqrtˆ, who took power at the end of the Sixth Dynasty. Her name, like that of many other royal ladies in the Archaic period and the Old Kingdom, contained the element “Nt.” Interest in Nt ˆqrtˆ appears to have risen during the Saite at the same time as that in Nei\t, two thousand years after the original queen’s death. Pharaoh Psammatikhos I named his daughter Nitokris and she went on to became a central figure in Egyptian politics in the seventh century.137 According to later historians, the first Nitoqerti was supposed to have been beautiful but with fair hair and complexion. Egyptians associated this coloring with Libyans and, hence, Nei\t. It was also associated with the so-called “Typhonians” or “People of Seth,” who seem to have been regularly sacrificed in Egyptian ritual.138 An even more suggestive source of information comes from Herodotos:
The story was that she [Nitokris] ensnared to their deaths hundreds of Egyptians in revenge for the king her brother, whom his subjects had murdered and forced her to succeed; this she did by constructing an immense underground chamber in which, under the pretence of opening it by an inaugural ceremony, she invited to a banquet all the Egyptians whom she knew to be chiefly responsible for her brother’s death; then, when the banquet was in



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 561
full swing, she let the river in on them through a large concealed conduit-pipe. The only other thing I was told about her was that after this fearful revenge she flung herself into room full of ashes to escape her punishment.139
This hydraulic engineering feat is very similar to that of the legendary queen of Babylon, also recounted by Herodotos. Her name was also Nitokris but no trace can be found of her in Mesopotamian annals.140 The passages on revenge for her brother’s death resemble legends of ŒAnat’s vengeance on the killers of her brother Ba Œal. One of the most vivid episodes also took place in a banquet hall.141 This would seem significant given the identification of ŒAnat and Nei\t made above.
Elissa and Dido
Nitokris’ own fate is even more interesting. It resembles that of Dido, another historical queen around whom many myths and legends accumulated. According to later historians, Dido, “Beloved” or Elissa to use her historical name, was the sister of King Pygmalion. Toward the end of the ninth century, Pygmalion ordered the murder of her husband, a priest of Melqart, the god of the city. Elissa/Dido then fled west with a band of aristocratic followers, among whom was a priest of Juno (ŒAnat/ Tanit) first to Cyprus and then to North Africa. There she founded Carthage, Qart h≥adast “new town.”142 Dido’s fiery suicide was vividly described by the Latin poets Virgil and Silius Italicus, both of whom attached her fate to the betrayal by the Trojan hero Aeneas, who left her to found the city that led to Rome.143 The story in this form is, of course, anachronistic since the fall of Troy took place four hundred years before the foundation of Carthage in 814 BCE. Other forms of the tale are earlier. Timaeus of Taormina, writing in the third century BCE, referred to Dido’s having thrown herself onto a funeral pyre to avoid marrying a Libyan king.144 In the first century CE the Roman historian Pompeius Trogus embellished the story saying (as Virgil had) that Dido had first stabbed herself with a sword and then burnt herself to avoid dishonor.145 In late antiquity it was believed that Elissa or Dido had become divine and had been worshipped in Carthage as a goddess.146 At the same time, however, she was closely associated with Juno Caelestis (Juno of the heavens) who is generally recognized as the Roman counterpart of Tanit.147 This association has led scholars, at least since Movers in the



562 BLACK ATHENA
mid-nineteenth century, to identify the two and see a connection between Dido’s funeral pyre and the use of fire in the cult of Tanit. Since the discovery of the tophet at Carthage, the queen’s legendary self-sacrifice has been seen by some scholars as a mythical etiology of, or justification for, immolating children.148 Analogy suggests that the legends surrounding Nitokris might have served the same etiological function for similar practices in the cult of Ne–it. It should be noted that the Egyptian queen had the physical characteristics of a sacrificial victim. Ne–it and Tanit may also be connected by a symbol associated with the latter: the so-called “caduceus” found frequently at Carthage. This symbol can be interpreted as a figure-8 shield with an open top or a pole planted in the ground. From the shield strings or bands hang down. This symbol of the Libyan Tanit, which does not occur in eastern Phoenicia, would, therefore, seem similar to the LybioEgyptian sign (Palladion) of Ne–it discussed above.149 To return to the find at Knossos, two pieces of evidence point to an association with Ne–it, First, in the room of the children’s bones are large numbers of loom weights apparently coming from an upper room in the same building.150 This equipment would suggest religious textile manufacture as reported in the temple precinct at Sais or in the weaving of the Peplos at Athens. Loom weights, however, have been discovered elsewhere in religious sites at Knossos with no iconographic association with the Shield Goddess.151 On the other hand, in seventh century Jerusalem there were long established: “houses of the male prostitutes attached to the house of the Lord, where the women wove vestments in honour of As=herah.”152 The name As=erah seems to be associated with the Canaanite goddess >Atirat. It also appears in the unique phrase “his >As=erah” next to Yahveh with a painting of the two as cow demons on a wall found at Kuntilet Ajrud in the Negev.153 On the other hand, it may well be that by the First Millennium >As=erah was simply a word for “goddess” in general and that Yahveh’s consort was specifically seen as ŒAnat. ŒAnat was worshipped at the important Yahvist cult center at Bethel. The “Jews” who settled at Elephantine, or the southern frontier of Egypt in the seventh century BCE, built temples for Yahveh and ŒAnat, although, as mentioned above, these temples may have been influenced by the reigning Saite Dynasty with its cult of Ne–it. Jeremiah denounced the worship of the “queen of heaven” among the exile community in Egypt; scholars generally agree that this “queen” was ŒAnat. A number of Aramaic texts from fifth-century Egypt refer



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 563
ring to “ŒAnat” or “BaŒal husband of ŒAnat” could well be seen as Jewish.154 Thus, the weaving at the temple in Jerusalem might well have been of covers for, or symbols of, ŒAnat. In general, therefore, the loom weights indicate an association of Athena with Ne–it and ŒAnat. A second connection between the finds at Knossos and Egypt is the presence in the Knossos room of children’s bones and of a scarab of the Second Intermediate period, of a type associated with the Hyksos in Sinai and the east Delta.155 Although the new finds do not conclusively confirm the identification of Ne–it with Athena, they do strengthen the links between the latter and the Shield Goddess. They also strongly suggest parallels between the Aegean goddess and ŒAnat/Tanit. Thus, the connection through the sequence—sign of Ne–it, Shield Goddess, Palladion of Athena—is associated with many other parallels: the defeat of Asterios; the making of a ritual cloth, armor or dress; the cult of fire at night; and child sacrifice. Together these seem to establish links among these goddesses dating back to the Bronze Age.
The two goddesses
This is the context for thinking about the beliefs held by Greeks of the classical and Hellenistic periods that Ne–it and Athena were the same. The sixth-century numismatic portrait of Athena as possibly “black” has been referred to above. In the following two centuries, Herodotos and Plato were convinced of the identity of the two goddesses. As the latter put it: “The chief city in this district is Sais—the home of King Amasis—the founder of which, they say, is a goddess whose Egyptian name is Ne–ith and in Greek as they assert Athena.”156 All subsequent writers until Plutarch followed this assertion. By the time of Plutarch the Saitian divinity had become assimilated to Isis, although Plutarch still referred to her as Athena.157 In Roman times Athena was represented on the Athenian Akropolis seated on a crocodile to show that she came from Egypt.158 This symbolism must have come from Ne@it’s being worshipped as the mother of the crocodile god Sebek and the fact that in Egypt she was sometimes portrayed as accompanied by or breastfeeding two crocodiles.159 Conventional wisdom, today, maintains such associations of Ne@it with Athena were merely the result of Egyptomaniac fantasy and should be dismissed as absurd. According to most modern scholars the mistaken



564 BLACK ATHENA
correspondence between the two was simply based on a number of coincidences. Both were goddesses of war with renewable virginity. They were patronesses of weaving and each was symbolized by a bird of prey, a vulture or an owl. Given the ancient associations suggested above and the consistency of the classical tradition, these parallels cannot be shrugged off so easily. Furthermore, the attacks on the identification of these two have to be seen in the light of the general ideological disinclination among nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars to see any genuine connections between Egyptian and Greek religion. Thus, all in all, the case against a fundamental identity of the two godesses is extremely implausible.
ATHENS AS A COLONY FROM SAIS?
In addition to the connection between the two goddesses, Athena and Athens the city were specifically linked to the city of Sais. Pausanias mentioned the sanctuary of Athena Saitis near Lerna and the legendary site of Danaos’ landings on the Peloponnese. In the passage on the temple at Thebes of Athena Onka (discussed in Volume 2), Pausanias wrote “this Athena . . . is called by the Phoenician name of Onga not by the Egyptian name of Sais.”160 As stated above, none of Plato’s commentators or other later writers denied a genetic relationship between Sais and Athens. The only dispute was over precedence. Some followed Plato in claiming Greek priority but others maintained that Athens was a colony of Sais, a belief that survived into the nineteenth century.161 Despite their civic and Hellenic pride and their contempt for contemporary Egyptians, Athenians certainly felt a religious affinity for Egypt as a whole and Sais in particular. As one modern scholar has summarized the position, “The Athenians were well known for the belief that their own religious beliefs were the same as those of the Egyptians.”162 Naturally, Egyptians saw Athens as the daughter city of Sais. Diodoros Sikeliotes, writing in the first century BCE summarized their arguments: “the Athenians they say are colonists from Sais in Egypt, and they undertake proofs of such a relationship; for the Athenians are the only Greeks who call their city asty, a name brought over from the city Asty in Egypt.”163 Anne Burton in her commentary on this book of Diodoros is not impressed. She points out that by classical times, what she refers to as ist “seat, place” lost its final -t, unless preserved by a following vowel as in the temple of Isty near Thebes.164 Although early Egyptologists transcribed the word as ist or ast, it is now generally written st. There is,



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 565
however, no reason to doubt that at some stages the word had a prothetic ˆ-, a- or e-. St is a very common Egyptian noun and place-name element.165 It is possible that st was introduced from Egyptian before the dropping of final -t s. In any event, as Anne Burton has pointed out, the final vowel would have protected the form from this process in either Egyptian or Greek. Introducing the word in the Second Millennium would allow for the obvious connection between the Athenians’ name for their city and the word asty. Asty in Greek means “city” in the same sense as the Egyptian St: as the place rather than the community or polis. Asty, which has a very dubious Indo-European etymology, clearly existed in Greek long before classical times; it is well attested in Homer.166 The second point made to Diodoros by the Egyptians was that the Athenian:
body politic had the same classification and division of the people as is found in Egypt, where the citizens have been divided into three orders: the first Athenian class consisted of the “eupatrids,” as they were called, being those who were such as had received the best education and were held worthy of the highest honour, as is the case with the priests in Egypt; the second was that of the “geomoroi,” who were expected to possess arms and to serve in defence of the state, like those in Egypt who are known as husbandmen and supply the warriers; the last class was reckoned to be that of the “demiurgoi,” who practice the mechanical arts and render only the most menial services to the state, this class among the Egyptians having a similar function.167
Burton’s objection to this is even more explicitly based upon the Aryan Model and on the inconceivability of Bronze Age contacts. She argues that the Athenian three-caste system must be very old since Aristotle referred to its existence by 580 BCE. Plutarch even attributed the social division to Theseus. Hence, she holds, it was necessarily native and not Egyptian.168 From the point of view of the Ancient Model, the antiquity of the Athenian system actually strengthens the case for Egyptian influence. Attika was never conquered by the Heraklids and it was widely believed in classical antiquity to have preserved ancient institutions lost elsewhere, Therefore, the establishment of a social hierarchy by Egyptian or Aegypto-Greek founding heroes in the Bronze Age would seem quite



566 BLACK ATHENA
plausible. It should be remembered that the name Theseus has no IndoEuropean etymology but can plausibly be derived from the Egyptian Tsw “commander, protector of the poor” still preserved in the Coptic joeis “lord, Jesus.”169 The third “proof ” given to Diodoros by the Egyptians was that founders of Athens such as Pevth", Kevkroy and jErecqeu;" were Egyptian or double natured, that is to say, Greek and barbarian. Burton points out that Pe–te–s is the same as the Athenian leader Petewv" found in the Iliad. She believes that the name “may well be of Egyptian origin,” indicating that the Egyptian name PÅ dˆ is attested in Greek as Pe–te–s.170 Possible Egyptian etymologies for Kekrops will be discussed below. The lexicographers list Erekhtheus under jEricqovnio": jeri- being a prefix of uncertain value but generally thought to be intensifying and -cqovnio" “of the earth” referring to the hero’s supposed autochthony. This indeed was the predominant Greek tradition. Nevertheless, Erekhtheus is both the earliest and the most common form of the name. Erikhthonios may well be, as Chantraine suggests, only a popular reconstruction of a non-Greek name to fit the legend. He also points out that Erekhtheus was a divine epithet usually linked to Poseidon. Diodoros was not the only source to claim that Erekhtheus was an Egyptian colonist. Anne Burton cites another source stating that he came from Sais.171 A possible Egyptian etymology for his name is Erekhtheus is Åh°ty “horizon dweller,” a frequent divine epithet. Thus, two of the names claimed by Diodoros’ Egyptian informant, Pe–te–s and Erekhtheus, have possible if not plausible, Egyptian etymologies and lack Greek ones. Erekhtheus was supposed to have introduced the Eleusinian Mysteries from Egypt to Attika.172 Burton also points out that Apollodoros and the Parian Marble agree that the cult of Demeter was introduced to Attika from abroad. Apollodoros placed the introduction in the reign of Pandion and the Parian Marble in that of Erekhtheus.173 Furthermore, in the twelfth century CE the Byzantine scholar Tzetzes quoted Kharax of Pergamon, a priest and historian of earlier centuries CE, on Kekrops’ having colonized Athens from Sais.174 Burton rejects Paul Foucart’s case, made at the beginning of the twentieth century and based on cultic similarities, that the Eleusinian Mysteries were introduced from Egypt. She claims that his work has been superceded by that of G. E. Mylonas and other later writers.175 Black Athena Writes Back touches on this debate.176 Here, however, it



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 567
should merely be pointed out that Diodoros’ Egyptian informants were probably right when they claimed that the two Eleusinian priestly families—the Eumolpids and the Kerykes—saw themselves, at least in Hellenistic times, as Egyptians.177
Kekrops
Arguments in favor of derivation of the names Athens and Athena from H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt will be set out at the end of this chapter. The identity of these names should be sufficient to explain the relationship seen by Greeks and Egyptians at least since the sixth century BCE.178 At this point, however, we shall look at the name of the city’s legendary founder, Kekrops. This name, I maintain, is Egyptian. Despite the statements by Kharax and others that Kekrops came from Sais, other evidence suggests that he was not connected to that particular Egyptian city. Like many Greek cities, Athens was supposed, according to legend, to have had more then one foundation, It was generally acknowledged, however, that the first of these was that of Kekrops, although even he was seen as the successor to his father-in-law King Aktaios.179 Like some other writers, Apollodoros specified that Kekrops was autochthonous, but maintained that the founder had “two natures.”180 Pausanias held there were two Kekropes, one early and one somewhat later. He and others also maintained that Kekrops was part man, part serpent.181 As quoted above, however, Diodoros’ Egyptian informants claimed that “two natures” meant that he was part Greek and part Egyptian.182 Herodotos distinguished Kekrops from the local Pelasgians, implying that he was the first of a series of outside settlers. Furthermore, he saw the name of “Athenians” as having been introduced by a later founder, Erekhtheus.183 Apollodoros believed that the cult of Athena was introduced to Athens during the reign of Kekrops. Like Herodotos, however, he stated that the city was called Kekropia in his time.184 The Roman historian Pompeius Trogus maintained in the first century CE that, although Kekrops had founded the city, its dedication to Athena only came in the reign of his successor Amphiktyon.185 Pausanias referred to this later king but attributed only the introduction of the cult of Dionysos to him.186 He did not specifically link Kekrops to Athena and, in another section of his work, described the devotion to Zeus of the founder of Athens.187 To sum up, given the clear identification of Athena with Athens, it is remarkable



568 BLACK ATHENA
how relatively little ancient historians associated the city’s founder with its matron goddess. According to the Parian Marble, Kekrops was supposed to have begun his reign in 1581, that is sixty-three years before the same stone set out Kadmos’ arrival at Thebes and seventy years before Danaos’ landing in the Argolid.188 While 1581 is far too low for the Revised Ancient Model, no reason can be made to challenge the sequence given on the inscription. Hence, if the Hyksos invasions are to be placed in the late eighteenth century, Kekrops, if he is to be given any historicity, must come still earlier. The historian Hekataios of Miletos maintained that the name Kekrops was foreign.189 Paul Kretschmer argued that there had been metathesis and that the name had originally been *Kevrkoy “with a tail” Kevrko" “tail.”190 His argument was based on the tradition that Kekrops was half man and half snake. The original meaning of kerkos, however, was “stick” but it was extended to any thin projection from the body: “pig tails, penises” etc. This certainly did not include tails, like those of snakes, that were an extension of the body itself. For these tails the general term oujravwas used. Returning to Hekataios’ view of a foreign origin, the name Kekrops bears a similarity to the frequently used prenomens H°pr kÅ RŒ, HŒ° H°pr RŒ and HŒ° kÅw RŒ of the three Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs known today as Senwosret I, II, and III. The form closest to Kekrops is HŒ° H°pr RŒ, the name of Senwosret II who was the least powerful and shortest-reigning of the three pharaohs. Later historians, however, confused their identities. In the third century BCE, for instance, Manetho fused Senwosrets II and III into the great Sesôstris.191 The final -ôps in Kekrops is the Greek word for “eye, face,” that is frequently used as a suffix for persons. The metathesis of liquids from third to second position necessary to derive Kekrops from HŒ° H°pr RŒ was discussed at the end of Chapter 8. In any event, it is no more difficult to demonstrate such a connection than it is to show the generally accepted one between S n Wsrt (Senwosret) and Sesôstris or Sesôsis. The accepted and hypothetical conquests of Senwosrets I and III have been discussed at some length in Volume 2. In the relevant chapters in that volume, however, I only suggested that Senworsret I campaigned to the north in Anatolia and possibly other regions bordering the Black Sea.192 Here I should like to go further and consider possible contacts between Egypt and the Aegean during the Middle Kingdom.



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 569
Athens and Middle Kingdom Egypt
Writing almost two thousand years after the alleged events, Diodoros reported:
Of Rhadamanthys, the Cretans say that of all men he rendered the most just decisions and inflicted inexorable punishment upon robbers and impious men and other malefactors. He came also to possess no small number of islands and a large part of the sea coast of Asia, all men delivering themselves into his hands of their free will because of his justice. . . . Moreover, because of his very great justice, the myth has sprung up that he was appointed to be judge in Hades and the same honour has been attained by Minos [Rhadamanthys’ brother].193
The image of the brothers’ judgment of the dead, which was also reported by Hesiod and Homer, is thoroughly Egyptian. In Volume 2, I argued that there were intricate parallels between the legendary Cretan king Minos and the first Egyptian pharaoh Min/Me\ne\s and his brother Rhadamanthys, founder of the Middle Kingdom.194 This raises a number of possibilities: (1) Middle Kingdom Egypt had contact with the Aegean. (2) Egypt had some kind of hegemony over that region. (3) Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs were involved in founding Kekropia or protoAthens. Evidence from archaeology and art history make the answer to the first question clear. Egyptian contact with the Aegean can be seen from Egyptian objects found in Middle Minoan Crete. Although considerably less plentiful than those found from the Late Bronze Age, around thirty have been listed. There are scarabs and worked gold hilts of daggers or swords.195 The most striking of all is the statue from the Twelfth Dynasty of an official called User. The context of the find is unclear but in the latest study of the statue Eric Uphill has argued persuasively that it fits a general Middle Kingdom pattern of distributing statuettes of ambassadors, officials, merchants and craftsmen and, therefore, should be taken as having arrived in the Middle Minoan period.196 In Egypt, there have been considerable finds of Cretan pottery from the Middle Minoan II period corresponding to the late Twelfth Dynasty. Most of the pottery has been found at El Haraga and Kahun at the mouth of the Fayum about which the Egyptologist Barry Kemp and the archaeologist R. S. Merrilees have written:



570 BLACK ATHENA
The important Middle Kingdom cemeteries at El-Haraga may well have served this town rather than some known desert edge community. There is a specific reference to a royal palace somewhere in the Fayum area at this time but whether here or towards the Fayum proper . . . cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the location of Senusret II’s pyramid nearby is itself indicative of a royal interest in this area during the Middle Kingdom.197
Pottery from Middle Minoan IA and IB and II and a serpentine lid typical of Crete have been found in sites from elsewhere in Egypt.198 These finds are only the tip of the iceberg. Iconographic developments leave no doubt that Egypt, the Levant and the Aegean had considerable cultural exchange, with the predominant flow in this period coming from Egypt. The intricate interactions between Egyptian and Cretan art during the Middle Kingdom has been traced by Arthur Evans, Wolfgang Helck and more modern scholars.199 The Australian art historian Janice Crowley has listed five motifs that she sees as having been transferred from Egypt to the Aegean during the Cretan Old Palace period, which corresponds with the Middle Kingdom. The five motifs are palms and palmettes, papyrus scale pattern, the tree-watering ritual and the Egyptian hippopotamus goddess of childbirth. The assistants of the childbirth goddess became the Minoan “genii” and went on, I argue, to become Greek nymphs and muses.200 The answer to the second question of whether Egypt had any kind of hegemony over the region in this period is less clear-cut. The predominant direction of cultural flow suggests this is true, as does the association of finds of Cretan pottery with royal sites. The sensational discovery of the “Tôd Treasure” also indicates that Egyptian hegemony may have covered the region. The Tôd Treasure was sealed in the reign of Amenemhet II, the son of Senwosret I and father of Senwosret II; it consists of many precious objects but the most significant is a group of 143 crushed silver bowls. When discussing the treasure in Volume 2, I argued that as it was found in the temple of Mont, the god of conquest. Primarily found toward the north, the bowls may well have come to the treasure as military loot or as tribute from defeated peoples. I also argued in Volume 2 that these objects came from Anatolia and were associated with campaigns there by Senwosret I and Amenemhet II.201 More recently however, scholars have started looking farther west. Peter Warren now argues that “many of the Tod vessel forms have very close ce



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 571
ramic parallels in MMIB-II Crete, sufficient to indicate a Minoan origin or at least strong Minoan influence upon the silver vessels.”202 Thus, there is some justification in supposing, not merely that Egypt staged campaigns in Anatolia in the twentieth and nineteenth centuries BCE, as I argued in Volume 2, but also that these had at least a political, if not a military, consequence for the Aegean. Evidence is still more sparse when we come to the third question: Could Twelfth Dynasty pharaohs have been involved in the foundation of Kekropia or proto-Athens? A positive answer does not necessarily follow even if one accepts an equation HŒ° H°pr RŒ = Kekrops. The Greek name Memno–n survived for a millennium after the reign of pharaohs called >Imn m h≥t.203 Similarly, the name HŒ° H°pr RŒ //Kekrops could have remained as a free-floating heroic title, suitable for attaching to the foundation of a city. Nevertheless, we should consider the possibility that Egyptians of the Middle Kingdom were involved with Attika. Given the Middle Kingdom cultural connections with Crete and the possibility of Twelfth Dynasty campaigns in Anatolia carrying effects farther west, such involvement is not out of the question. Unfortunately, later building in Athens has left little trace of Middle Helladic remains there.204 Thus, in this instance, the archaeological record can be of no help on this problem. Evidence of Attic contact with Egypt does exist, however. In Egypt artifacts of silver made in the Middle Kingdom have been found to contain lead traced by lead isotope analysis to the mines at Laurion in Attika.205 The romantic image of the Athenians as simple farmers who were above crass materialism has led to a significant underestimation of the importance of these silver mines to the Athenian economy.206 Given the exports of lead and silver from Laurion in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, Attika would seem to have had an economic significance in the Second Millennium BCE. Thus, the lists of Athenian kings before the Trojan War should not be dismissed out of hand.207 If, as seems reasonably plausible, the strong Greek tradition of Kekrops and the equally strong Egyptian one of Seso–stris can be linked to the historical figures of Senwosrets I, II and III, settlement of Athens by members of an Egyptian expedition or other people making use of the pharaoh’s name and prestige would provide a coherent description of the city’s first foundation. This explanation puts the founding in the first half of the nineteenth century BCE. Naturally, however, this must remain merely a tentative working hypothesis.



572 BLACK ATHENA
As such, it would nevertheless, provide a plausible background for a second foundation of the city, connected to the cult of Athena. Hyksos expansion from their first base in the Argolid would be the second wave. For the new settlers, some 200 years later, Kekrops and his city would indeed seem autochthonous or “double-natured,” The garbled record of the new settlement would be in the legends surrounding Amphiktyon, Erekhtheus and Theseus. The use of Amphikyton probably refers to the organization of the Attic federation, or amphiktyony, often attributed to Theseus.208 According to Diodoros’ Egyptian informants, Erekhtheus, king of Athens, was born an Egyptian and continued to have connections with Egypt.209
Troizen
Theseus began his heroic journey to Athens from Troizen. The city’s reputation for extreme antiquity and the early association of Apollo with Oros/Horus and Pittheus with Ptah were discussed in Chapter 19.210 In that chapter I discussed what Pausanias saw as the most ancient temple in Greece, the sanctuary of Apollo Thearia. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the English traveler Sir William Gell reported seeing at or near that site strange flat-sided, eight-sided tapering columns of a stone resembling black basalt. He believed that these must have come from the most ancient sanctuary described by Pausanias more than 1,600 years earlier.211 James Frazer seems to have seen some of these columns and he accepted Gell’s conjecture that as they were “so different from the ordinary types of Greek columns [they], may have belonged to the sanctuary of Thearian Apollo.”212 Tapering, flat-sided octagonal pillars have been found from Middle Kingdom Egypt, in tombs of Nomarchs at Beni Hassan and other tombs in central Egypt, as well as at the earliest temple at Deir el Bahri, one built for Mentuhotep II.213 They seem to have been abandoned, during the New Kingdom for more elaborate forms. Scholars as early as Champollion have seen these earlier columns as forerunners or even prototypes of Doric forms.214 Like all Greek columns, however, the Doric were fluted, a form deriving from bound reeds that had been used in Egypt and southwest Asia at least from the Third Millennium.215 Thus, while an influence from the Egyptian octagonal columns is clear, local modification is equally clear. The “unGreek” columns at Troizen show one route influences could have taken from Middle Kingdom Egypt to



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 573
the Archaic Peloponnese. The idea that Pausanias could have seen a sanctuary constructed in the first half of the Second Millennium BCE is no more surprising than the survival of the Parthenon or the Pantheon into the twenty-first century CE. Indo-European offers no explanation for the name Troizen or Trozen. On the other hand, a plausible etymology exists from the Egyptian city name TÅ Sn (Esna), which was the major cult center of Ne–it in Upper Egypt.216 This derivation leads to a possible religious association between Troizen and Athena. As at Athens, Troizen had a tradition that its original name was different and that the cult of Athena was introduced sometime after the city’s foundation.217 Thus, the cults of Athena and Poseidon, which became central at Troizen, seem to have been added to ancient worship of Apollo/Horus and Pittheus/Ptah . There may be some truth to the oracle quoted by Pausanias that Apollo and Poseidon had exchanged Delphi for Kalauria, an island off the coast of Troizein.218 According to Pausanias, this exchange came during the reign of Oros’ son Althepos. Athena and Poseidon had a dispute over the land and Zeus ordered them to share it.219 In Volume 2, I discussed various aspects of this mythical struggle in which I see the dominant aspect as Athena’s or Ne–it’s imposition of order on the forces of chaos symbolized by Poseidon/Seth.220 The most famous example of this struggle is, of course, the battle set in the Attic Athens, although it was also reported of other places dedicated to Athena in Boiotia and at Troizen. On the acropolis of Troizen a temple of Athena was known as Polias “of the city” and Sqeniav" was its root. Conventionally sqevno" (H) is translated as “ strong,” however, Sthenias, which is used as a divine epithet for both Athena and Zeus, is very old and very odd in Greek: it is the only word beginning with sth-. It has no Indo-European etymology but has two plausible Egyptian sources that could easily have become conflated; stny “to distinguish, honor” and sth≥n n “to make dazzling, radiant.” For Athena’s association with brilliance and the Egyptian word th≥ n in particular see below.221 While Athena’s temple was on the Akropolis, Poseidon’s was outside the city wall. That position does not mean he was not central to Troizen. Strabo and Pausanias even called the city Poseidonia.222 His titles were Basileus “official, king” and Poliouchos “holder of the city.” Fifth-century coins of Troizen had a portrait of Athena on the obverse with Poseidon’s trident on the reverse.223 Poseidon was also the patron god of the Kalaurian League, an



574 BLACK ATHENA
amphiktiony based on Kalauria just off the coast of Troizen. This ancient league, which included Troizen, Athens, Aigina and the Boiotian Orchomenos among its seven members, not only cuts across Iron Age tribal lines but also the boundaries of the late Mycanaean kingdoms.224 Therefore, it is plausible to suppose that it originated before their consolidation. Archaeological evidence suggesting the antiquity of the cult of Poseidon at Kalauria comes from a Second Intermediate period or Eighteenth Dynasty scaraboid found in a Late Helladic context inside the oldest temple of Poseidon in Kalauria. Its back was in the shape of a hippopotamus, an animal associated with Seth. On the face, a pharaoh on a chariot rides over fallen enemies; the chariot is associated with both Poseidon and Libya.225 No one doubts the centrality of the cults of Poseidon and Athena in Mycenaean Greece and particularly in Troizen and Athens. In myth Poseidon, sometimes in the guise of Aigeus, was the father of Theseus, the city hero of both Troizen and Athens. Poseidon’s identification with Seth and the centrality of Poseidon and Athena to Mycenaean and Hyksos religion were discussed in Volume 2.226 In this section we are concerned with the hero’s mother Aithra whose name seems to be linked to aither–“upper air,” which has also been associated with Athena.227 Another association between the two comes from a report by Pausanias that Aithra had been entrapped by Poseidon as the result of a dream sent to her by Athena.228 Like Seth for the Hyksos or Poseidon for the Mycenaeans, Athena seems to have been a special protector of the new invaders. According to Diodoros, Danaos landed in Rhodes where he founded the temple of Athena at Lindos before he reached Argos. A little later Kadmos founded a cult of Poseidon at Ialysos on the same island. Kadmos was also supposed to have presented a bronze cauldron inscribed in Phoenician letters to Athena’s temple at Lindos.229 This gift is also reported in the Lindian list of religious offerings. Across the Argive Gulf from Troizen Pausanias described: “From Lerna another road runs by the seaside to a place which they name Genesium [birthplace]. Beside the sea is a small sanctuary of Genesian Poseidon [Poseidon of birth]. Adjoining Genesium is another place named Apobathmi [‘landing place’], where they say Danaus and his daughters first landed in Argolis.”230 A little earlier in the text, Pausanias had referred to a sanctuary a few miles up the coast where there are two sanctuaries of Athena. The first, by the short river Pontinos, was supposed to have been founded by Danaos, and the second, a sanc



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 575
tuary of Athena Saitis, was on top of the mountain from which the river flowed.231 In his commentary on this Frazer did not speak in his own voice but quoted the geographer William Martin Leake, who was born in 1777 and, therefore, has been formed before the advent of the Aryan Model:
The ruins of a castle . . . now occupy the summit of the hill, and consequently stand on the site of the house of Hippomedon and of the temple of Minerva [Athena], whose epithet Saïtis indicates that her worship here was introduced from Egypt, and thus agrees with the reputed foundation of the temple by Danaus. At Sais we know that Nei\th the Greek Athene, was held in great honour.232
Frazer partially reasserts his orthodoxy to the Aryan Model by crossreferencing his discussion of Pausanias’ statement in (Book 9: 12.2) that the Egyptian name of Athena was Athena Saitis. There Frazer writes, “The Greeks identified her [Ne–it] with Athena (Herodotus, ii.59; Plato, Timaeus, p.21E; Hesychius, s.v. Nhi?q), partly perhaps on the ground of the resemblance between the names.”233 Some authorities consider that in Hyksos Egypt, Seth’s consort was probably ŒAnat.234 According the epitome of Manetho’s History by the Christian writer Julius Africanus, the first Hyksos king was called Saite–s.235 Mallet interpreted this to mean that he made his residence at Sais.236 Another possibility would be to link him to the Hyksos name ŒAnat H≥r, mentioned above, and to place him as a devotee of ŒAnat/Neit. Too much should not be made of this since Josephus rendered the name from Manetho as Salites. Salites has been equated with a pharaoh called Sarek (Sa Œrk) who was mentioned in a list of priests from Memphis.237 Gardiner and von Beckerath, however, see Sarek as one of the last of the Hyksos.238 It is also strange that when referring to the Sethroite nome in the eastern Delta Josephus actually called it Saite.239 This reference makes it probable that Josephus, not Africanus, made the slip on the name of the first ruler. In any event it is clear that, like their descendents the Israelites, the Hyksos had a significant cult of ŒAnat and it seems likely that this was seen in Egyptian terms as a cult of Ne–it. Such an interpretation would fit the historical pattern of the Revised Ancient Model for Crete. It has been mentioned above that while the iconography of the Shield Goddess existed earlier, it had only become widespread in Middle Minoan III. Furthermore, the discovery of the



576 BLACK ATHENA
Hyksos scarab in the room with the children’s bones suggests some contacts between the cults.
SUMMARY OF THE CULTIC EVIDENCE
The legendary evidence from Athens and the legendary and physical evidence from Troizen indicate that Egypt had cultural and religious influence in the Argolid and Attika during the Egyptian Middle Kingdom and the Middle Helladic period on mainland Greece and that Egypt could have had political influence over parts of the Aegean during these centuries. The early cults that survived seem to have been of Horus and Ptah. At a later stage, probably sometime in the late eighteenth century BCE, a new wave of influence arose and was associated with the Hyksos. In this second wave, the dominant figures were the rivals Ne–it/Athena and Seth/Poseidon.
ETYMOLOGY OF NAMES
All the above is, of course, speculative. What seems overwhelmingly likely, however, is that Athena derived most of her attributes from Ne–it and that the name Athena or Athanaia comes from the Egyptian H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt. First, we should consider some Greek proper nouns associated with Athens and Athena and their plausible Egyptian etymologies.
Place-names
In his myth of the grandeur of ancient Athens Plato set the boundaries as Mount Lukabhttov" to the east and the hill of the Pnuvx to the west.240 A plausible origin for Lykabe\ttos is from the Egyptian Åh°t ˆÅbt “luminous region in the East, where the sun rises,” a toponym that appears in the Book of Coming Forth by Day.241 For the derivation of Pnuvx, Puknov"the meeting place for the citizen juries of Athens from *pÅ qnbt “the court, of magistrates, tribunal, judicial council etc.,” see Chapter 9.242 Neither of these have Indo-European etymologies. Plato’s school was established in 385 BCE in a wooded district northwest of the city walls of Athens called jAkadhvmeia. Diogenes Laertius derived this name from the obscure mythical hero jJEkadhvmo". He also maintained that the original name was Hekade–my not Akade\my.243 Akade\meia was situated between two roads: the main road to the north



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 577
west from the Dipylon, the greatest gate in Athens, and the “Sacred Way” to Eleusis on which religious processions entered Athens. Sometimes this procession too went through the Dipylon; at other times it may have gone through another gate just 60 yards away.244 This would fit neatly with *Œqr dmˆ “entry into the city, entry district.” The Coptic for Œq is o\k; on the other hand, Œqy “solemn entry of the king” became aik “consecration.” The long /e\/ in Akade–my matches that found in de\mos derived from dmˆ.245 The place-name antedated Plato and, given other evidence of his lack of any knowledge of Egyptian, it is unlikely that he understood its meaning even though it was particularly appropriate for his school.
Mythical beings
The first of these descriptions is the derivation of parqevno" from the Egyptian *Pr th≥n. Here once again we are concerned with Nei\t’s association with Libya. Arthur Evans paid particular attention to the Libyan people known to the Egyptians as Th≥nw. The Th≥nw, who lived to the west of the Nile Delta, were known for their “Th≥nw oil,” which Newberry identified with olive oil (providing yet another association with Athena, whose sacred tree was the olive) and for faience which in Egyptian was called th≥nw.246 These products were connected, as Evans explained, by the supplies of natron (sodium carbonate) necessary for the manufacture of faience and found in the Libyan oases.247 Alan Gardiner, too, wrote about the Th≥nw. He pointed out that, although they were Libyans living in Cyrenaica and had been previously thought to have been “white,” they were represented in Egyptian paintings as physically resembling Egyptians although dressed barbarically.248 Gardiner further considered the possibility that the Th≥nw lived farther south, in or near the Fayum.249 More recently, Vandersleyen has rejected his hesitation on this.250 In his note on the subject, Gardiner mentioned an Old Kingdom reference to a Nt Th≥nw .251 Henri Gauthier, the geographer of Ancient Egypt interpreted Pr th≥n as “house of crystal, house of faience.”252 The name is attested for the temple of Osiris at Sais. The phonetic and semantic parallel of Pr th≥n with Partheno–n is striking. The Egyptologist Arno Egberts objects to such a derivation. He admits that he can provide no alternative and that the phonetic correspondence between Pr th≥n and Partheno–n is excellent. An analogy with the Coptic tehne, from an earlier dhnt, suggests that the stress in th≥nt lay on the first syllable, hence yielding a Greek *-then.



578 BLACK ATHENA
Egberts’ objection is semantic: How could maidens be associated with Osiris who was so virile that he could even impregnate his sister/wife after his death?253 Egberts has clearly scored a point in that Partheno–n is unlikely to have derived from this particular Pr th≥n. Nevertheless, I maintain that the etymology still holds. The first ground for this claim comes from Ne–it’s tight and ramified connection with th≥n, which will be explored further below. From the Saite period there are direct references to Nt th≥n.254 The second ground comes from the toponym Pr Åh°t “house of the brilliant.” This synonym of Pr th≥n is attested for temples of Hathor and Ne–it.255 Third is the image of young women as “brilliant” and “sparkling” in many cultures. Fourth, the combination Pr+ th≥n is likely because the extreme frequency of the toponymic prefix Pr-. Gauthier lists more than five hundred instances. Thus the chances of temples or other buildings, as well as the divinities who share their names, named *Pr th≥n are high. Through sacred paronomasia, Ne–it was associated both with the T ̇nw and with the product of their land th≥n “faience.” As an adjective th≥nt is defined as “brilliant, flashing, jewels, blue green.” The last is the color of faience. It was also seen as the color of the bright sky and fragments of the firmament as they appeared on earth in the form of the green mineral malachite.256 Parthenos in Greek means “young woman, virgin” and was especially used for the virgin goddesses Artemis and Athena. The Egyptian and Greek words share a number of specific meanings. Both convey “blooming” and “happy.” Th≥nt was also used for “bright eyes of divinities” and for a part of the eye. The word parthenos also has a special sense of “pupil.” Athena had a number of epicleses concerning eyes: jOfqalmi'ti" and jOxuderkhv". Above all, the Homeric epithet Glaukw'pi", applied to her and other frightening creatures, meant “pale and brilliant eyes.” This obviously derives from the word glaukov" (H) “gray, light blue, terrible, brilliant.” Indeed glaukos is another word that Jasanoff and Nussbaum admit lacks an Indo-European etymology.257 It has a good Egyptian one, however, in gÅgÅ “dazzle, amaze,” which is written with the eye determinative. There was also a goddess called GÅgÅwt but it is impossible to tell whether she was a form of Nt. Glaukos is also related to glau'x glaukov" (H) “owl,” the large-eyed, ferocious bird and epithet of Athena that is parallel to Ne–it’s vulture. GÅgÅ also provides an excellent etymology for Gorgwv, which also had the combined form Gorgw'pi" meaning like glaukw'pi" “fierce look.” The face and eyes of the Gorgon petrified all



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 579
that saw them. Her close and ancient association with Athena has been referred to above.258 In Utterence 317 of the Pyramid Texts the crocodile god Sobek, son of Ne@it, brings “greeness to the eye of the great one [feminine].”259 This description plausibly refers to Ne–it herself. In the Fifth Dynasty inscription referred to above, the term Nt Th≥nw is followed by “eye of Nt.” The Egyptian Egyptologist Ramadan El Sayed plausibly suggests “this is perhaps an aspect of Nei\t worshipped in this period by the Libyans.”260 Plato described the eyes of Pheidias’ statue of Athena in the Partheno@n as set with jewels and Cicero saw light-blue flashing eyes in the ideal type of Athena’s Roman counterpart Minerva.261 Diodoros rejected the “Greek idea” that Athena had blue eyes as “a silly explanation.” According to him, the real reason why the goddess was called Glauko\pis was because “the air has a bluish cast.”262 In fact, the two images are not mutually exclusive and there is no reason to deny that Athena was sometimes represented as having flashing blue eyes. In many societies, such as those of Mongolia and China, where the overwhelming majority of the population is brown-eyed, blue eyes have been traditionally seen as a sign of ferocity. A striking illustration of this can be seen in the New Kingdom picture of a ferocious “hippopotamus at bay.” The hippopotamus was an animal of Seth. In reality hippo’s eyes are dark with a pinkish tinge, but this one’s eyes are painted a bright blue.263 In ancient as in modern Greece blue eyes were associated with the “evil eye,” indicating all kinds of bad characteristics. Thus the connotation of Glauko\pis was that the paleness of Athena’s eyes added to the terror she inspired.264 The same could well have been true of Nei\t in Egypt. In any event, her associations with blue-green faience and the bright sky and the association of th≥n (t) with eyes suggest that (although in late tradition hidden by a veil) her eyes too could be seen as blue.265 Pausanias, explicitly stated that the story of Athena’s blue eyes came from Libya.266 Thus, we may have the paradox that the goddess’s blue eyes came from Africa. While this complicates the name Black Athena, it strengthens my overall case and that of my preferred title *African Athena.
H≥T NTR (NT) NT ATHE–NA(IA)
The claim that Kekrops was Egyptian has been discussed above. At this point I shall return to the quotation from Kharax of Pergamon: “Kekrops



580 BLACK ATHENA
coming from the town of Sais in Egypt colonized Athens. Sais according to the Egyptians, is said legetai Athena.”267 The simplest way to understand the last sentence is to say that Hellenistic Egyptians saw “Athena” as a name of Sais. Sais was, in fact, only the secular name of the city. Its religious name, attested in hieroglyphic texts, was Ót Nt or Ót ntr (nt) Nt.268 Arno Egberts, my most formidable critic on this issue, attacked my original derivation from H≥t Nt. He had no semantic objection to the identification of Ne–it with Athena or of Athens with Sais. He is aware that this view was conventional among Greeks. Also as an Egyptologist he knew that Egyptian divinities were frequently referred to by their dwellings.269 Egberts’ three objections were to the phonetic correspondence between H≥t Nt and Athena. His first objection was to the derivation of jAq- from H≥t or H≥wt “temple.” He claimed that even in the Second Millennium it was normal for the final -t to be elided. While a number of Greek renditions of the toponymic prefix H≥t- were indeed jAq- in nearly every case the /t/ in H≥t was followed by a laryngeal /h≥/, resulting in the Greek theta, as in Athribis< H≥t-h≥ry-ˆb and Athur (Hathor)< H≥t- H≥r. A ground for an apparent exception was when H≥t was followed by a /t/ which was preserved while the final -t in H≥t was lost. Egberts cited a Coptic example: Atripe< H≥t-tÅ-rpyt.270 His case for the last is not clear since the origin of the Greek Aqribi" in Upper Egypt is almost always attested in inscriptions in the form H≥t-rpyt without the feminine article tÅ. Alan Gardiner supposed that it was said but not written.271
Egberts sees the /t/ as inserted and sometimes written with k (N16) tÅ “land” for the Lower Egyptian Athribis. Neither of these scholars entertain the possibility that the /t/ comes from the original -t in H≥t. For them the true situation appears in two other cases: Auaris< H≥t-wŒrt and Aigyptos< H≥t-kÅ-Pth≥. In these instances, the /t/ was missing, according to the general loss of final -t at this time in Egyptian. Despite the complication with this Athribis, there is every reason to suppose that the Egyptological orthodoxy is right on this issue. Egberts’ second objection is basically a repetition of the first. It follows from his reconstruction of the pronunciation of H≥t Nt around 2000 BCE as *h≥VnVt, V being an unknown vowel. Thus according to him I had “smuggled” in a /t/ in the middle and (was) “smuggling away” one at the end.272 It is generally reckoned that as a divine name, the -t in Nt was retained for religious reasons. Egberts’ third objection was my failure to explain the long vowel in the second syllable Athe–na<Atha–na.273



[CH. 22] ATHENA AND ATHENS 581
I believe that these objections can be met by turning to the attested forms H≥t-ntr Nt and H≥t-ntr nt Nt. H≥t and H≥t-ntr are virtually synonymous, meaning “temple.” As mentioned in previous chapters Pr and H≥t could both be used for the divinity and for a city central to their cult. It is also worth noting on the principle Gardiner applied to H≥t-(tÅ)-rpyt that H≥t-Nt may sometimes have concealed a H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt, increasing the number of instances of the latter form. The Middle Egyptian pronunciations of H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt can be reconstructed along the lines used by Egberts as *h≥V (n)t(r)V(nt) nVt. Looking first at the consonants, every Greek rendering of H≥t loses its aspiration. Therefore, we should find *V(n)t(r)V(nt) NVt (V again is an unknown vowel). In Chapter 10 where Greek borrowings from ntr were considered, examples were given where the consonantal structure of ntr was rendered in full: kav(vnqar)o" and Kev(ntaur)o". In others the n- was dropped but the final -r retained: VqVr: ajqhvr, ajqavrh and (ka)qarov". Others still preserved the n- but lost the final-r: [anqo", xavnqo" and (Ka)vanqo", etc.274 What was never lost was the t/q (theta was by far the most common transcription of the Egyptian /t/). That this is not merely a failure to detect Greek words that have lost the /t/ is indicated by the two Coptic compounds originally containing ntr: henet\e “monastery” < H≥t-ntr and hont “pagan priest”< H≥m-ntr “servant of god, priest.” In the first, the nwas preserved but the second is less clear. In any event the medial -tsurvived. It is also possible that the n- in the ntr in H≥t-ntr nt Nt survived in the place-name Anthe–ne–, near the site of Danaos’ landings in the Argolid.275 It is not difficult to derive the -n- in Athena from that in H≥t Nt. The omission of the final -t is equally easily explained. This is not, however, because it disappeared in Egyptian early in the Second Millennium, because in the case of Nt the final -t appears to have been retained archaistically. Rather the final -t was simply not tolerated in assimilated Greek words.276 Thus the consonantal structure should be seen as *V(n)t(r)V(nt) nV. Dropping the n- and the -r, which on grounds given above seems permissible, it becomes *V(n) t/qV(nt) nV. Now to consider the vowels. There is no doubt that H≥t was vocalized *H≥at. Athribis in the Delta was transcribed H°a-at in Assyrian texts.277 All Greek renditions of H≥t begin with A-. Thus in Greek we can reconstruct *Aq(n)V(nt) nV. The next vowel remains uncertain. However if the /r/ were lost it would probably lead to the vowel’s lengthening, still more so if there had previously been the genitive marker nt.



582 BLACK ATHENA
The original vocalization of the divine name Nt would seem to have been *Na–it÷. The vowel’s quality is suggested by the biblical name of Joseph’s Egyptian wife >ÅsEnat which was probably from the Egyptian n(y) s(y) Nt “she belongs to Nt.”278 The quantity is indicated by Plato’s rendering of Nt as Nhi?q.279 This and other renditions of Nt as Nit- or Neth also indicate an original form *Nai\t÷with an off-glide. The glide does not always appear in Greek. It is not present in the Doric jAqa–vna– or the Mycenaean Atana. Homer, whose language was sometimes more archaic than that written in Linear B, uses jAqhnai?h. The earliest form was presumably * jAqa–nai?a. This fits well with a reconstructed Egyptian *hatV@Na–it÷. In Greek the initial h- was de-aspirated, the /t/ rendered q and the final -t dropped, thus giving *AqV@Na–ia÷. The etymology from H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt removes Egberts’ three objections to the derivation. The q is not derived from the -t in H≥t but from the -t- in ntr. This derivation, together with the Greek intolerance of final dentals, answers his first two objections. The elision of the -r from ntr and possibly that of the genitival adjective nt would explain the long vowel a–>e–.
CONCLUSION
The imperfections of the phonetic aspect of this etymology should be seen in the context of the beauties of the semantic characteristics. The etymology from H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt, both city and divinity, explains the identity of the names of the Greek goddess and her cult centers or cities: Several places were called Athe–nai and Athena was worshipped away from the city in Attika.280 Athens and Athena provide the only example in Greece in which the same name was used for the divinity and her city. The cultic parallels associated with weaving, sacred cloth, armor, the Palladion, and fire rituals are too deeply embedded to be explained away as fictitious constructions of the classical period. There was also the apparently universal belief among Greeks of the classical and Hellenistic periods that the associations rang true. Herodotos always referred to the goddess of Sais as Athena and Plato stated that “the founder of . . . [Sais] is a goddess whose Egyptian name is Ne–ïth and in Greek, as they assert, Athena.”281 Then there is the explicit testimony of Kharax of Pergamon that Athena was an Egyptian way of saying Sais. Furthermore, neither the lexicographers nor my critics—Egberts, Jasanoff and Nussbaum—have proposed any alternative, let alone a more convincing etymology. Until someone does that, the derivation of jAqhnai?h from H≥t-ntr (nt) Nt remains plausible and should be allowed to stand.

CONCLUSION
T
he purpose of these volumes is to refute this widespread conventional view repeated by Roberts. I hope to have demonstrated that neither Ancient Egypt nor the pagan Levant were dead ends. Both of them, through Greece and Rome and the civilizations of the monotheist religions, have been central and crucial to western history. This volume is the last in the series. Originally I envisaged three but later toyed with the idea of writing four. I have now returned to the original number. The pattern has, however, changed. In the Introduction to Volume 1, I proposed that the second volume would encompass, archaeology, Bronze Age documents, place-names and vocabulary of Egyptian and Semitic origins! The third was to be concerned with mythological parallels. While writing Volume 2, I realized that I had bitten off far more than I could chew and that language required a separate volume. At the same time, however, I was taking so much material from the draft of the volume on mythology that what was left would be more appropriate for articles than for books. Hence, this final volume has been more or less restricted to language. In its early chapters, I consider language families. Other scholars have convinced me that (1) Afroasiatic and Indo-European are, at a deep level,
The spectacular heritage of Egypt’s monuments and a history counted not in centuries but in millennia stagger the critical sense and stifle criticism. Yet the creative quality of Egyptian civilization seems, in the end to miscarry . . . it is difficult not to sense an ultimate sterility, a nothingness, at the heart of this glittering tour de force. . . . Egypt’s military and economic power in the end made little permanent difference to the world. Her civilization was never successfully spread abroad . . . —J. M. Roberts, The New History of the World (2002, p. 86)

genetically related, and (2) that there were lexical exchanges between northern Afroasiatic and PIE. The focus of this book is, however, on connections between specific languages: Egyptian and West Semitic, on the one hand, and Greek, on the other. I have looked for possible Afroasiatic influences on Greek at four levels: phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon. The first two attempts were largely unsuccessful. Certain phonemes, notably prothetic letters, have become far more frequent in Greek than in other Indo-European languages, as a result of lexical borrowings from Egyptian and Semitic. Nevertheless, no new phonemes developed from the latter. Similarly, only relatively few Greek morphological features can be derived from Afroasiatic. The introduction of Egyptian particles has somewhat influenced Greek syntax. Nevertheless, the major effect has been on vocabulary, and three-quarters of this volume has been devoted to this. When facing those who suggest Semitic origins for Greek words, classicists have been known to respond along the lines of “it is always possible to pull Semitic etymologies out of a hat.” I argue that these possibilities come about precisely because so many such etyma actually exist. Behind the orthodox objection lies the belief that if one is sufficiently loose in phonetics and semantics one can find Afroasiatic derivations for any Greek word or name. My counter to this is that the etymologies proposed in the volumes of Black Athena have generally followed phonetic regularities. I have not, however, even attempted to create rigidities, partly because, when considering loans, one can never establish the elegant equations often possible within language families. Even more importantly, it is simply impossible to establish one-to-one phonetic correspondences among three languages, all undergoing different phonetic shifts during the three thousand years in which they were in contact. The flexibility that this allows does not mean that “anything goes.” For example, I cite a word and a name: anthro\pos “man” and the god Dionysos. Both are central to Greek culture and both lack Indo-European etymologies, but I cannot find an Afroasiatic origin for either. Limits have been imposed. Nevertheless, after thirty years studying these topics, I am more than ever convinced that approximately 40 percent of the Greek vocabulary and an even greater proportion of proper nouns can be derived from Afroasiatic languages. I do not accept the mantra often repeated by orthodox historical lin



CONCLUSION 585
guists that “a few certain etymologies are worth more than thousands of uncertain ones.” This idea assumes that there is no connection between languages x and y and that any argument to the contrary needs to have “proof.” I am convinced that between cultures known on other grounds to have been in contact, while quality of etymologies is desirable, quantity is also important. I believe that the more plausible etymologies of the kind proposed here one finds, the more additional ones should be accepted. It will be interesting to see whether the often intricately connected mass of evidence presented in this volume will convince scholars in the relevant disciplines. When dealing with a far more important issue, Charles Darwin expressed my views exactly:
Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume . . . , I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. . . . But I look with confidence to the future—to young and rising naturalists who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.1

In northern Netherlands the word is pronounced kol, in the south and Flanders as gon, and by purists as gol. In this case the variation was caused by dialect differences in the borrowing language. A striking example of this factor can also be seen in two Italian borrowings from the Arabic da/r a≈ ≈in ́a “factory,” which became darsena “internal part of a port where ships are disarmed or repaired” (probably through Genoese) and arsenale, “naval shipyard, arsenal” (through Venetian).

Gelb referred to four in, ìna, is “to, for” and Œasta “for, to.” I can only suppose that with is he was referring to the Greek eij", ej" “to, into.” This, however, has been plausibly derived from *en”. I do not know what PIE root he linked to Œasta. Could he have been referring to the Latin ast “on the other side” similar to at “but”? Apart from the semantic difficulty of such a connection, the word has not been traced back to PIE. In any event, the other two examples I give bring the total back to four. 36. Bomhard does not include the Semitic examples *na/n ́, *ni/*ne, nu/no “negation” as Proto-Nostratic. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 681 §562). The Eblaite forms are taken from Gelb (1977, 23). The other Semitic forms are from Moscati et al. (1969, 121) and the PIE forms from Pokorny (1959). Orel and Stolbova (1995, xx, passim) and Takács (1999, 132) reconstruct the Egyptian /n/ as ProtoAfroasiatic “*l” and give a number of examples from other Afroasiatic languages (mostly Semitic). Clearly there was, as in other languages, considerable interchange between the two sounds, but the evidence from the oldest Semitic languages, Eblaite and Akkadian, and the parallel with Indo-European suggest that the original phoneme was /n/. The Proto-World form “*k(u)an” “dog” is found in the Chinese quan from Archaic *k’iwEn. Karlgren (1964, § 479). For the PIE ku^8on, Orel and Stolbova (1995) set out two roots *kan (§1425) and *kun (§1498). They propose to link them by deriving both from a hypothetical *küHen. Leslau (1979, vol. III, 286) reported a form from the East Gurage language of Zway as gEn*i but he saw this as a Cushitic loan word. He denied Ullendorf ’s (1950, 343) proposal to connect it with the Semitic kalb “dog.” The final -b is generally considered to be an affix marking wild animals. Diakonoff (1970, 461 n. 23); Takács (1994, 67) and Ehret (1995, 18). Thus, Ullendorf was clearly right. The situation is complicated by the cognicity of the Semitic form with the PIE
*kw[h]elp, which is only found in Germanic, the English “whelp”; see Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 474 §319). Diakonoff (1995, 221) denied their proposed Nostratic root not only because he saw the final -b as a suffix, but also because the Semitic
word had no labiovelar, kw. This may be, but, as seen above, the root is frequently found with a medial -u-. Could *kwelp be a Semitic loan into Proto-Germanic? Nevertheless, it seems clear that, at least in this case, the original Afroasiatic final shifted from n>l, not the other way around. See also Sasse (1993). 37.

They may also have been used to grind the ochre used in burials. Rock salt could also have been ground in querns. It is interesting that the the Nostratic root *mul/mol “grind” resembles the Afroasiatic root ml( ̇) “salt.” According to Ehret (2002b), the affix -∆ signified iterative “repeating.” See also Takács (1999, 152). 45.

49. Dolgopolsky (1998, 26). 50. Ibid. (1998, 30). Proto-Nostratic also had words for “bow.” 51. Hermann Möller (1911, 76 and 163) already had suggested these common etymologies for IE and Semitic. See also Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 219 n. 24; 502–4 n. 351 and 637–9 n. 518). These use a different set of correspondences from those Dologoposky posits. 52. Hodge (1981b, 309). 53. Whittle (1985, 16–7). 54. Pearson (1983, 120). 55. Kerns (1994, 153), who sees Nadene as only spoken in mountainous regions, explains Chinese as the result of Tibetan expansion. On linguistic, but not archaeological grounds, Driem (2001, 408–33) sees the Urheimat of Tibeto-Burman, of which Chinese is a member, as a Neolithic culture in Sichuan. The agriculture of this culture, however, depends on such cereals as foxtail millet (Seteria italica) and broom-corn millet (Panicum miliaceum) and these appear to have come from northwest China. (Li, 1983, 30) and Chang (1983, 68). Thus the origins of the Neolithic culture would seem to derive from the microlith-using gatherers and harvesters of that area, who were almost certainly not Nostratic speakers.

56. Phillipson (1993, 98). 57. Alison Brookes, the distinguished archeologist of Africa, accepts this principle. Brookes (2002). Pace Hassan (1980, 433–4) who denies it strongly. 58. Dolgopolsky (1998, 19) used the word “subtropical,” which he later (1999, 43) changed to”warm Mediterranean.” The names for tropical animals do not provide an altogether reliable guide as they can easily be adapted to fit another ecozone, for instance, the Egyptian db “hippopotamus” became the Canaanite dob “bear.” 59.

For arguments against linking Khoisan languages even within southern Africa, see Westphal (1971). For a bibliography of scholarship on this debate see, Güldemann and Vossen (2000, 102). These authors propose a way out of the impasse: they suggest that the name “Khoisan” should be applied to any language in southern and eastern Africa that is not Bantu, Nilo-Saharan or Cushitic, without implying or denying the existence of any language family. 3.

Harlan (1982, 639) refers to the finds of African millets and sorghum in late Second Millennium BCE sites in India. There are now finds of finger millet (Eleusine coracana) dating to the Third Millennium. Blench (2003) argues that, as these antedate evidence of domestication in Africa, this diffusion may have been without domestication. I find this difficult to accept. Others even believe that Indian millets derived from China [see the bibliography in Witzel (1999, 32)]. Witzel can find no etymological links between Chinese and Indian or African names. It is also possible that enset or “false banana,” the pith of which is processed and eaten, was propagated by cutting in very ancient times in much of Ethiopia. See Blench (in press c). 12.

Speakers of the first three are present in the Sahara today and appear to have been there for many millennia. Khoisan speakers are not, but clearly they once existed far to the north and west of their present range. In this connection, it is also interesting to note the striking correspondence among the Afroasiatic *qurab “scorpion” [Orel and Stolbova (1995, 349 §1609)], the

Gardiner (1957, 514, T: 21,22,23). The centrality of hippopotamus hunting to Egyptian culture can be seen in the myths of Horus’ struggle with Seth. Horus was a water monster usually a hippopotamus. Säve-Söderbergh (1953) and Störk (1982, c. 503). From this myth, these of Perseus and the water monster and St. George and the dragon can be derived through iconography. 67. Takács (1999, 213). He takes the Canaanite ßin to be the Proto-Semitic sound. The attribution of this later Canaanite phoneme to Akkadian is shaky. Professor Gordon told me (Boston, September, 1994) that he accepted this interpretation merely because it was the Semitist tradition. Although there clearly are distinctions, it would seem more cautious to render the Proto-Semitic sibilant as /s/, thus bringing it into conformity with the rest of Afroasiatic. There is also the Berber qrs or krs “bind.” 68. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 339 §1560). 69. Job 40. 24; see Pope (1973, 328). 70. Cole (1963, 250).

I come back to h≥rm as a loan into Greek in Chap. 21, nn. 54–70. 73. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 139 §603). The final -b in db would seem to be a marker for dangerous or harmful animals, found throughout Afroasiatic. Diakonoff (1970, 461, n. 23), Takács (1994, 67). The concept of *db as a large dangerous animal may not be restricted to Afroasiatic. Takács (1999, 45) relates the Egyptian db to the Nilo-Saharan Proto-Rub (Kuliac) do∫b “rhinoceros.” 74.

As we shall see, however, Blench has an explanation for the unity of Ancient Berber. 83. Bender (1975). 84. I shall argue in Chap. 4 that the gender system, widespread in Indo-European and generally accepted as secondary, was influenced by Afroasiatic. 85.

specialist, I prefer Bender’s views and those of most other experts. As mentioned in the last chapter, the /s/ causative is not merely Afroasiatic; it is found throughout the Nostratic family. The other two features are more restricted. 107. See Bender (1975, 219); Hudson (1978, 73–4); Ehret (1978); Hetzron(1978, 57) and Orel and Stolbova cited in Blench (1994, 6). 108. Bender (1997a, 22). 109. Oliver and Fagan (1978, 353). 110. Henrici (1973, 83). 111. Bender (1997a, 20) appears to accept this dating. 112. These are the following:
Diakonoff Bender Total
Semitic 8.5 15 23.5 Berber 13.5 15 25.5 Egyptian 10 12 22 (Proto) Chadic 13 11 24 Beja 9.5 12 21.5 Awngi (Central Cush) 9.5 10 19.5 Sidamo (HEC) 9.5 11 20.5 Oromo (LEC) 9.5 12 21.5 South Cush 9.5 9 18.5 Omotic 9.5 4 13.5
113. Takács (1999, 36), however, follows Orel and Stolbova (1995) and Diakonov (1996) in stressing the “great mass” of Egypto-Chadic isoglosses. 114. Bender (1975, 143). It should be remembered that, as Ringe (1995) points out, these low percentages are similar to those within Euroasiatic and Nostratic. 115. Parson’s dissociation of Hausa from Chadic seems unlikely. Parsons (1975, 42158).
116. The families are Omotic, East Cushitic, Central Cushitic, and Semitic. Beja and South Cushitic are not far away. Blench (personal communication, Cambridge, January 2001b) argues that Chadic must have started its trajectory from central Sudan. I cannot see any indication of this origin from the present locations of Chadic languages. 117. See n. 37, above. 118. See n. 2, above. 119. Sands (1998, 163–6). I am grateful here to Christopher Collins for providing me with the necessary references and to Roger Blench for encouraging me to pursue this line of research. 120. Blench (1999a, 4). He has now (2002c, personal communication) constructed a new Sprachbund, including Hadza, Sandawe, Ik and Dahalo. He calls it “Hadzic” and he sees it as influencing Proto-Afroasiatic. 121. Ehret (2002a, 122). This is also the tentative opinion of George Starostin (2003, 124). 122. Sands (1998, 94).

Professor Christopher Collins has discovered traces of a class system, very unlike that of Bantu, in Ju|'hoansi (personal communication, Cornell University, November 2001). 131. The three way—masculine, feminine, neuter—gender system found in the NigerCongo language of Defaka, spoken in the Niger Delta, is clearly secondary. See Blench (2002c). 132. Greenberg (2000, 185). In an earlier piece, Greenberg referred to a small number of examples of sex-linked gender systems in Austroasiatic, Australian and Amerind languages. ([1978] 1990, 241–70). 133. See, for instance, Andersson and Janson (1997, 145). 134. Elderkin (1976, 297). 135. See n. 88, above. 136. For a brief description of Dahalo, see Elderkin (1976, 290–5). Blench (2002c) classifies it as “Hadzic.” 137. Ehret (1996, 15) argues that the weakness of gender among Omotic languages and the existence of South Cushitic singular-plural markers indicate that in “preProto-Afroasiatic” there was no sex-gender. He admits, however, that particular paired sets of South Cushitic markers “tended to go with either masculine or feminine nouns.” I believe that in this case it is difficult to distinguish between an ancient substratum and later influences. We know that Omotic was affected by its Nilo-Saharan–speaking neighbors. It is extremely likely that the South Cushitic languages have been influenced by the Nilotic- and Bantu-speaking peoples who surround them.

Blench (2001b) made this interesting suggestion. While Chadic is tonal with a large number of consonantal homonyms, he made the typological argument that tonal languages are less likely to develop purely phonetic scripts because tones are not as easy to represent visually.

In other words they were fancy “Egyptianisms.” In a personal communication, Rendsburg (2001) doubts Gordon’s claim (1988, 262) that this form can be found from Ebla. 177. Klein accepts this and Vycichl (1983, 272) does not object. For the derivation of the Greek hetoimos “ready, realized” from Egyptian or Canaanite passive participle h°åtum/h≥atum “sealed,” see Chap. 14, n. 10. 178. See Ellenbogen, C+erny and Klein. Vycichl follows Fronzarolli (1972, 251) in denying this because of the attestation of abiyanum in this sense in a text from the Syrian city of Mari. The idea of an Egyptian loan into Amorite does not seem impossible to me. 179. Klein derives it from the Egyptian ms “to carry.” I prefer the semantics of msˆ. 180. This seems closer than the usual Semitic etymology from dyn “judge.” Klein is
tentative about this. Brown, Driver, and Briggs (1953) derive it from >dn “to be
strong.” The Greek Adonis is generally derived from >ådo\ni “my lord.” I believe that the Roman name Antonius has the same origin. 181. See Hoch (1994, 6, n. 16).

Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 778). Roots are given according to the reconstructions of the author cited. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov and Bomhard and Kerns (1994) follow the glottalic theory, while Pokorny was working in his variant of the traditional system. Pokorny (1959, 80) sets this root under *au(÷e)-, aue÷d-, aue÷rleading to the Hittite wa-a-tar “water.” Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 607 §483) list a Nostratic root *wat-/*wEt. I do not accept Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s including the Greek aisa “lot” under *ai (Pokorny does not either) as it is much more plausibly derived from the Egyptian isw “reward” Coptic asu or esu. See Chap. 12, nn. 3–6. 37. The capital H is the conventional sign for a PIE laryngeal of unknown quality.
The small elevated [h] after a stop indicates a phonetic but non-phonemic alternation of aspiration and nonaspiration. This is discussed further in Chapter 5. 38. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 779).

Raimo Anttila’s (2000) detailed study of the PIE root *ag/ is a perfect example of Indo-Europeanist tunnel vision. He does not consider the wider picture of its origin, although he looks for Indo-European loans into Finnish. 42. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 779). 43. Chap. 3, nn. 10–1. 44. Dolgopolsky (1998, 27–8 §18). 45. Bomhard (1999, 54). 46. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 770). See n. 88 below, for my skepticism about this etymology. 47.

Of course, some of the Kartvelian loans could be from Akkadian spoken by Assyrians who we traded in eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus. They could also have come from Egyptian if we accept the traditions of Sesostris’ expedition into Kartvelian-speaking territory. See Vol. 2, 228–30. 49. Dolgopolsky (1998, 45 no. 43) *diqa “goat” and Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 198 no. 4) *bar/bEr “to swell puff up.” 50. Mallory (1989, 151). 51. Proto-Kartvelian speakers could have contacted PIE speakers northeast of the Black Sea in regions where the Kartvelian language Mingrelian has been spoken. 52. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 423 § 266). 53. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 319 §1460). 54. For the pronunciation of /Å/ as r/l, see Chap. 8, nn. 22–6. 55. In addition, the Egyptian earth god Akr is already attested in the Pyramid Texts. This would seem to be a rare example of the Egyptian /Å/ being sounded from the beginning as an >aleph. See the discussion in Takács (1999, 273–5). 56. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 498 §346). 57. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995) base their claim on Nehring (1935) which appeared before the work of Bernhard Karlgren. Karlgren established the reconstruction of earlier Chinese on a systematic basis. His work does not have a form ‘kuo *ngie÷u÷. The modern niu “cow, ox” is listed by him (1964, 262 §998). This form, however, is what Karlgren calls the “ancient form,” from circa 600 BCE. The earlier “archaic form,” reconstructed with less certainty, has a final -g: *ngiu÷=g. This would indeed make it closer to the Sumerian *Nu[d] (=gud, gu). 58. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 492). 59. Chap. 3, n. 44. 60. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 203 §896). 61. Orel and Stolbova (1995) distinguish two renditions of this, la> (1632) and s[a< (2323). For *na, see Blench (1993b, 73). 62. This final is similar to that in Sumerian and Archaic Chinese (Karlgren’s terminology). 63. Ndigi (1997, 158). The /ng/ sound is also found in South Bantu, see, for instance, the Cinyanja ngombe “cow, bull.” 64. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 396 §1832).

65. See Mainz (1993, 82) and Bilolo (2001, 65). 66. Dahood (1981b, 282). 67. Dahood’s hypothesis (1981b, 282) that ÷kpr was a ransom kop–er (of copper) leading to kipper “atone” (as in Yom Kippur) is far-fetched but possible. Helck (1979, 125) argued that the Linear B kuparo referred to henna. 68. Pace Waetzoldt (1981, 366). 69. See Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 618, 773). Pokorny (1959, 86–7) does not have this root. He associates *auso “gold” with *aue÷s “light, morning.” Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s final-k[h] is hard to justify. Another example is that in Chinese the same word *kie÷m (later jin) is used for both “gold” and “metal.” 70. Mallory (1989, 121) accepts the first proposition but is uneasy about the second. 71. See Mallory (1989, 120). For the ideological background of Indo-European studies see Vol. 1, 308–99 and this volume Chap. 1. 72. See Lewy (1895, 4). For a detailed study, see Levin (1995, 13–27). Gamkrelidze and Ivanov’s proposals are listed in their work (1995, 769–73). 73. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 769 and 439). Levin (1995, 28) is clearly uncertain about the direction of the loan since he writes that it shows “that the prehistoric evolution of IE was not isolated from Semitic.” Dolgopolsky does not claim *tawr as Nostratic and had previously listed it as a loan from Semitic into PIE (1987, 2).
74. For the first conventional interpretation, see Moscati et al. (1969, 43–5). For the opposing view see Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 95). Bomhard sees the aspiration as initially not phonemically distinctive. 75. Dolgopolsky (1998, 48, no. 49). He had earlier (1987, 2) seen it as a loan between Semitic and European. 76. Cohen (1970–76, 2: 100–1) and Levin (1995, 116–7). 77. Chang (1988, 38), Levin (1995, 116–7). This is puzzling; jieyang is “castrated ram.” The character jie “castrate” with a “sheep” radical is not included in Karlgren’s series, § 313, which has a number of different values for the archaic forms with the same “phonetic” *ki÷at *ki÷ät with final outcome jie. None of these correspond to Chang’s form, but any of them could correspond to *g[h]ait. “Sheep” may indeed have been the original meaning with the sense of “castration” arising through confusion with another root with final pronunciation jie “castrate.” 78. For the archaeological evidence, see Pearson (1983, 120–3). The Jiegu were a tribe associated with the Xiongnu or Huns. With another radical the name Wujie appears to refer to a neighboring people whom Pulleyblank (1983, 456) identifies with the Uighurs. It also appears to have been the name of a tribe generally associated with the Xiongnu. 79. Levin (1995, 105–6) reconstructs a labiovelar/gw/ “in the background” of the PIE form. 80. Dolgopolsky does see a Nostratic root (1998, 47, no. 47), jir(i) “young male animal” which could possibly be related. For the Afroasiatic root, see Orel and Stolbova (1995, 247 §1100).
81. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 769). 82. See Chap. 2, n. 36. Western Gurage has the form gängär [Leslau (1979, 3: 273)], showing once again how easy it is to slip from /l/ to /n/ and vice versa.

See Chap. 2, n.51 and Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 219 § 24). 86. Cohen et al. (1993, 4: 250) write that the forms in Beja and Agau are loans from Semitic. 87. Dolgopolsky (1987), also, sees it as a loan from Semitic to PIE. 88. For Dolgopolsky’s hypothetical Nostratic root *cant see n. 44, above. 89. Pokorny (1959, 40). Also see Chap. 10, nn. 5–9, below. 90. Möller (1911, 99). 91. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 502 §351). 92. Ibid., 497–8 §345.
93. Levin (1995, 104–5) is convincing when he suggests that the /u/ in *gurn represents the labiovelar gw found in the Germanic “quern” and the Celtic breuan. He sees the loan as being from Indo-European to Semitic rather than the other way around. 94. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 771). 95. See Takács (2001, 109–10) and Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 657 §535). 96. Karlgren (1964, 114 §405r). 97. Obenga (1993, 330 §84). 98. Bender (1996, 80 § ss24). 99. Witzel (1999, 59). 100. Even before that they may have wondered about the Aramaic pilqå. A Sumerian word for “ax” is balag, which is clearly related to the Akkadian pilaqqu. The loan direction must be from Semitic to Sumerian as plg/q is so deeply rooted in Afroasiatic. 101. See Muss-Arnolt (1892, 85) for a nineteenth-century bibliography on the subject. See also Mayer (1960b, 350–1). Related roots ÷png “split” and ÷pnq “sluice” exist in Egyptian with cognates elsewhere in Afroasiatic. See Takács (2001, 4502). Orel and Stolbova (1995, 416 §1938) reconstructs an Afroasiatic root, *pal “cut divide.” They specify (423 § 1979) *pilaq “knife.” Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 230–1 §35) see plg/q as extensions of a Nostratic root *p[h]ily-*p[h]ely- “split, cleave.” None of them mentions the Egyptian or Sumerian forms. In this general context, Mallory’s dismissal (1989, 150) of this “comparison that simply will not go away” as a mere “wander word” clearly illustrates his ideological position. 102. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 620, 771). 103. It is also possible that sekyra was borrowed from se\cu\ris. 104. See Brown, Driver and Briggs (1953) and Klein (1987). 105. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 409 §248). 106. As Vycichl explains (1983, 136), the boat determinative indicates that the basic meaning was to navigate on water. 107.

This is Brosman’s summary (1982, 254) of Brugmann’s argument. 134.

The actual pattern must have been very irregular both historically and geographically and probably many more generations were involved. I am grateful to Dr. Lori Repetti for this scheme. 8. Some of the few are referred to in Chap. 10, n. 7. This line from the “Road to the Isles” is actually from Scottish Gaelic, which in this case has the same construction as the Irish. Irish, by contrast to Irish English, is a good example of a contact language. While retaining its phonology, morphology and syntax, it is full of English and other foreign words. 9. When discussing this phenomenon Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 184) cite the English and east Asian examples and add Iranian loans in Armenian and Arabic loans in modern Persian. 10. Humboldt (1988). 11. Since the semantic areas occupied by Greek loans in Coptic overlap with the non–Indo-European areas found in Greek, I believe that a high proportion of the Greek loans into Coptic had Egyptian or Semitic origins. 12.

24. See Thomason and Kaufman (1988, 365, n. 22). Similarly, a linguist has noted that “in written Vietnamese the words borrowed from Chinese make up approximately 70% of the vocabulary. In spoken Vietnamese there are considerably fewer words of Chinese origin.” Ngo (1999, 203). 25. Renfrew (1998a). 26. Finkelberg (2001) states that Linear A was specifically Lycian. This may be a case of misplaced precision, but the general argument that the basic language of Linear A was a form of Anatolian is convincing. See also Owens (1999). 27. The chief scholars with the relevant expertise are not merely such Semitists as W. Muss-Arnolt, Heinrich Lewy, Cyrus Gordon, Michael Astour, Saul Levin and John Pairman Brown, but also the classicists Walter Burkert and Martin West and the Indo-Europeanist Oswald Szemerényi. The only specialist Renfrew cited in the area of Semitic loans into Greek was Emilia Masson. For Masson’s extraordinarily restrictive list, see Chap. 7, nn. 20–2. The words Renfrew cites, which have strong Semitic or Semito-Egyptian etymologies, are asaminthos, kados, kithara, xiphos,

There is also kunisu the Akkadian ku(n)nisu “wheat”; yane, yayin the Canaanite term for “wine”; kireyatu qiryat “city” and the frequent word kuro “total” the pan-Semitic kol or kål “all.” 30. See Chap. 8, n. 47, below. 31. See, for instance, Lehmann (1993, 95). Previously, the Neo-Grammarians had proposed a four-way system with a series of unvoiced aspirates ph, th, kh and kwh and a palatal series k,{kh{, g[and g[h. These were later seen to be unjustified.

An example of an apparent shift from s>h also exists inside Hebrew s;br “examine,” sbr “interpret dreams” and h≥br “classify the heavens.” Possibly the two former were loans from Akkadian that had retained the initial s-. They could also have been taken from the Egyptian sbÅ “knowledge, star.” See Chap. 10, nn. 99–126. 64. The causative /s/ would appear to be Nostratic. Greenberg (2000, 200–2 §50) claimed it for Euroasiatic. In Indo-European there is the so-called s-mobile in which /s/ appears to have been added randomly at the beginning and end of roots. Conventional Indo-Europeanists do not quite know what to do with it. As Winfrid Lehmann expresses it, “the meaning of -s- in the late proto-language is difficult to determine precisely. It may have indicated completion or terminative meaning” (1993, 169). It seems likely that a major source of these forms is a causative /s/. See, for instance, the modern English “fall” and “spill,” “wipe” and “swipe,” “whirl” and “swirl,” etc. 65. Laroche (1958, 159–97; 1960, 155–8).

In Late Egyptian the initial letter would have represented a neutral dental [Loprieno (1995, 38)] and it is conceivable that the Greek Tyros was influenced by that. 83.

For a survey, see Chantraine s.v. ónoma. See, also, Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 126–30). Wyatt (1972b, 4) denies that any laryngeals existed in PIE. He then (3–10) attempts to make fixed rules out of this general tendency. For the problems with this rigid type of approach, see Szemerényi (1973c).
“Name” may derive from a Nostratic root *?in-im/?en-im, as proposed by Allan Bomhard. He finds it in PIE, Proto-Uralic and Sumerian. He does not see it in Proto-Afroasian (1994, 687 §569). According to Orel and Stolbova, (1995, 485 §2304), the Afroasian root is *süm. The Central Chadic languages Tera, Gude and Gudu, however, have forms with initial l-. The authors explain these forms as an “irregular lateral resulting from the contamination with the word for ‘ear.’ This explanation is, in itself, improbable. What is more, Newman and Ma (1966, 237 §70) give the reconstructed Biu-Mandara regional form dlEm and,
NOTES TO PAGES 133–136 611



elsewhere, tle–mi. This reconstruction would indicate a Chadic root *Òm. The argument that this root could be Afroasiatic is weakened by the fact that in Semitic the initial is s1- not s2-, which is the usual descendent of /Ò/. Nevertheless, the possibility that *Òm was the Afroasiatic root makes a derivation from Nostratic *?in-im/?en-im conceivable given the Afroasiatic tendency to reduce initial n- to l- and the extraordinary durability of the word “name.” The situation is further confused by the Nilotic root *(ka)rin, which Takács sees as the origin of the Egyptian rn “name” (1999, 38–9). 98. Lejeune ([1972] 1987, 210–1).
99. Thomson (1966, 27–8) and Meillet (1936, 143). 100. Clackson (1994, 33–5). While not as skeptical as Clackson of a special genetic relationship between Greek and Armenian, Ringe et al. (2002, 103–4) see the relationship as less strong than that between Italic and Celtic. They conclude, “in sum though we think that Clackson has overstated his case in denying any evidence (for the connection) we readily admit that the evidence is disappointingly meagre.” The only exclusive parallel they can accept is for their reconstructed form a@!mr “day.” I argue below (n.108) that the Greek hem–era is a borrowing from Egyptian and I assume that the Armenian term comes from the Greek. 101. Chap. 4, nn. 110–2. 102. A derivation from the Akkadian ereb “sunset” is not impossible given the analogy of the number of Irish words copied from the Latin p-: Pascha “Easter,” purpura “purple” etc. These result in Irish c- Casc, corcur. See Thurneysen ([1949] 1993, 570 §920). This analogy is, however, weakened by the fact that Irish of the time lacked a /p/ while Armenian possesses a /b/. Throughout the text letters or numbers in paragraphs will refer to the first known attestation of a word in Greek: (H) stands for a first attestation in the works of Hesiod or Homer—the earliest corpora of alphabetic Greek. A number in parentheses indicates the century BCE. 103. Sethe (1893) first proposed this idea for Egyptian. It was opposed by several later Egyptologists but revived by Hodge (1991). For Egyptian, see also Gardiner (1957, 209 §272). For Semitic, see Kienast (2001, 35). 104. Moscati et al. (1969, 60). 105. Meillet (1965, 19). The Armenian pattern could have been derived from the ancient Caucasian language, Urartian, but the predominant prothetic vowel in that language appears to have been u-. See Friedrich (1933, 68). 106. Onians ([1951] 1988, 412–5).
107. For a bibliography on this etymology see Chantraine. 108. The Egyptian km is also found in kémó in the West Chadic language of Pero and in the Proto-Bantu *-kom- “to become finished.” See Takács (1999, 43). 109. This copy must be very early as not only is the /Å/pronounced as a liquid but the /s=/ was rendered in Greek as c reflecting the Egyptian shift of s=from h.° For more on this word, see Chap. 8 below, n. 63 and 66. 110. Hbny itself is probably a copy from a Congo-Saharan word. 111. For this principle see Gardiner (1957, 209 §272). 112. C+erny puts forth the view of an Egyptian origin. Vycichl (1983), supported by Hoch (1994, 269 §383 and n. 59), challenges this view and proposes that the word is Semitic. He gives two grounds: one, that the root is found in Akkadian
612 NOTES TO PAGES 136–138



and Ge’ez and, two, that the Egyptian sign S /s/ is rendered as /s/ in Hebrew not as the /s;/ found in s;aq. Despite these arguments, I accept C*+erny’s hypothesis, partly because the Egyptian sibilant is uncertain. A word s=(Å)q exists with the probable meaning “bag.” More importantly, the proposed original form s(Å)q provides a suitable etymology for the Greek savrx, sarkov" (H) “flesh,” the opposite of psukhee–“spirit.” Chantraine rejects the etymology from an Indo-European root *twerk- “cut, part.” Equally, he rightly denies the proposal made by Risch (1961) that it came from an Indo-European root found in the Avestan qwar ́xs=htar “creator.” Risch’s argument that the original meaning of sárx in Greek was “giving form to something, or someone,” seems more reasonable. As far as I am aware there is no early attestation of s(Å)q in this sense but in Coptic texts the sarx is frequently seen as being “worn” by the spirit. See for instance, the phrase pgenos n–nr–om–e nt–auphorei ntisarx in The Life of Joseph the Carpenter Sahidic fragment 18.4 in Lamdin (1983, 196–208).
113. Chantraine describes the etymology of askos as non établie. 114. The Greek root appears to be *aspid. The addition of -d or -t to two-letter roots will be discussed below in Chap. 14, n. 18. Chantraine sees no clear etymology for aspis. He also links the snake name to it on the grounds that its neck is curved when it attacks, preferring this suggestion to the idea of a loan from another language. 115. Diodoros, 1.28.4. See Chap. 22, nn. 163–6 below. 116. Burton (1972, 122). I cannot find ˆst on the page she cites from Gauthier (192531, Vol. 1, 104) though I have no reason to doubt her. 117. Wiedemann (1883, 2) denies that astu is from ˆst. Chantraine sees an initial wand links it to the tentative Mycenaean form watu and the Vedic vastu “residence” (late), Tocharian A wast, Tocharian B ost “residence.” Even so, Chantraine sees difficulties with the vowels. For the initial w- not creating problems for the Egyptian etymology, see Chadwick (1973, 79, 398) who points out that in several instances the initial digamma found in classical inscriptions is not justified etymologically. 118.

Diakonoff noted (1970, 454, n. 10) that he had taken this bivocalism from Edwin Pulleyblank’s reconstruction of the Nadene languages Chinese and Northeastern Caucasian. Diakonoff maintained that the same structure obtained in Northwestern and Southern Caucasian and is analogous to the Indo-European base of *o and *E. 141. Diakonoff (1970, 466). 142.

151. This is not to say that the Semitic nominative pronouns of the type >anta/>anti are secondary. The endings -ta and -ti have a plausible Nostratic root. See Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 285–7) for a bibliography 152. Hetzron (1978, 59); Hudson (1997, 462) sees it merely as ank. 153. Ryckmans (1960, 20–1). 154. Diakonoff (1965, 34). 155. Moscati et al.

Frisk requires a metathesis *kon--yo" from a hypothetical *kom--yo" linking it to the Latin cum “with” or a speculative proto-Greek *kon “with.” Chantraine sees Frisk’s first hypothesis as the traditional one but also speculates that the root is *kei and links it to the Homeric keivwn “cleaving” which he extends to “sharing.” He also considers “further off ” the Sanskrit s;éva “friendly, dear.”

He points out, however, that since labialization took place before different vowels and stresses reconstructing Lycian and Lydian is full of great uncertainties. I would add that to a lesser degree the same is true of Greek. For instance, three of the four possibilities he gives for kwi>ti—tisis, tima and atimos—have plausible Egyptian etymologies and nothing to do with Indo-European labiovelars.

Pace Szemerényi (1974b, 49–50) who argues, on the basis of irregularities in the formation of the feminine ijereja “priestess,” that the original form cannot have been *-ew-ya but must have been *es-ya, and, therefore, that in all cases -euwas originally *es-u. Given the ease and frequency of changes between the semivowels /w/ and /y/, this seems a very slender thread on which to hang such a drastic thesis. 11. Loprieno (1995, 38). 12.

21. Levin follows the conventional derivation of >ot\ô from the particle >et- or >et\ used to mark definite objects. This derivation is strongly suggested by the fact that in the system some plural forms—second-person masculine >etkem feminine >etken and sometimes the third person as >ethem/ >ethen— are vocalized with /e/, while all other persons have /o/. He is puzzled by the difference and tentatively suggests that it resulted from “a mere phonetic reduction of >ot\.” He admits, however, that he cannot find a parallel for it, although, like others, Levin has tentatively linked it to >ôt “sign.” While I cannot provide the parallel or an explanation for the alternation of vowels in the pronominal series, I believe there is a possible etymology for the particle ‘et, as well as the vocalization /e/in the series containing >ot\ô. Notice that ' >et and all its derivations are restricted within Semitic to Canaanite and Aramaic. I believe that this etymology is from the Late Egyptian relativizing particle “the one who etc.” written nty but pronounced as “ent or even et.” See C+erny and Groll (1978, 497). In Coptic it was written as ent or et. Clearly, the overlap between a relativizing particle and an object marker is far from complete. Further, it is interesting to note that 'et- and its pronominal system are unique to Canaanite and Aramaic within Semitic. These two regions were heavily influenced by Egyptian culture. Nevertheless, the Canaanite restriction of /et/ to definite objects is paralleled by a tendency in the use of nty “to be compatible only with defined antecedents and frequently as direct objects. 22. This trajectory has been worked out by Fehling (1980) and Levin (1992). 23. Loprieno (1995, 69). For the possibility that the masculine p- derived from Khoisan,

see Chap. 3, n. 138, above, and Takács (2001, 375). Elsewhere, Takács provides another derivation for the p- in pn as a locative base. This, too, seems possible since in Proto-Bantu the locative gender prefix for “at, on” was pa. See Guthrie (1967, 37 §35.16).

The Greek Language in the Mediterranean Context: Part 3, Lexicon
1. For instance, in LOmO!ngO, spoken in Congo, the original voiceless bilabial fricative /F/ was transformed into a labiodental /f/ of the French type, partly because that was the way high-status Europeans pronounced it but also because “French borrowings with /f/ strengthened the new phoneme.” See Polomé (1981, 882). Interestingly, as we have seen above, no new sounds were introduced into Greek
2. Borrowing from Afroasiatic >aleph, ‘ayin and prothetic vowels was discussed in Chap. 5, nn. 96–118. Loans with the initial b- were an important addition since original Indo-European had few /b/ sounds. Egyptian compounds with the masculine article pÅ introduced /p/. As initial s- and medial -s- between vowels were lost in the Second Millennium (Chap. 5, nn. 62–9), new loans beginning with s- amplified the extremely small stock of those originating from /tw/. See Chap. 6, nn. 85–8, for a discussion of -ss- and -tt-. 3. Some allophonic pairs were, however, phonologized as a result of French influence. See Thomason and Kaufman (1988, 308). 4.

The ultimate source of the Semitic root may well be the Egyptian s=Åœs “ingots of gold.” The words are undoubtedly cognate and, as Egypt and Nubia were the sources of gold for southwest Asia, s=Åœs, or *h°rœs as it was pronounced before 2500 BCE (see Chap. 8, nn. 48–69, below), is almost certainly the original form. As such it may itself be the source of the Greek cru–sov". 13. For a fascinating discussion of the Indo-European stem that extends much further, see Benveniste (1973, 2, 9–15). On the other hand, Scharfe (1985, 543–8) has argued that what had been seen as the early Sanskrit word raj\: is not, in fact, attested, and that, therefore, there is no common Indo-European word for “king.” Winfrid Lehmann (1993, 68) accepts Scharfe’s argument on this. Despite the lack of early attestation, the root does appear independently in later Indian languages, so I see no reason to abandon it as an Indo-European root. 14. See Chap. 10, nn. 98–121; Chap. 9, nn. 57–81. 15. English can be described as unlike Greek, Swahili and the others in that it lost its Indo-European morphology as the result of the Norman Conquest. It is clear however, that case endings were lost through stress patterns that were already apparent before 1066. Thus, its “isolating” nature was an internal development and not the result of intense linguistic contact. See Thomason and Kaufman (1988, 306–15).

In 1907 Spiegelberg saw an Egyptian etymon for bus≥ from wÅd t “green linen.” He demonstrated that in early times the Egyptian d corresponded with the Semitic emphatics /t≥/ and /s≥/. He pointed out, on the principle of Säche und Wörter, that the biblical and Greek references to
620 NOTES TO PAGES 171–175



linen and other fine cloths pointed to Egypt. He also showed other Hebrew words in the same semantic field—s=e\s=“fine cloth,” y/iv]“to weave spin” and nuta “yarn, thread”—had Egyptian etymologies” (1907, 127–31). Eighty years later Levin (1995, 293, n. 337) expressed his doubts: “We think of Egypt as the ancient home of linen, the Egyptian word wÅd t “green fabric” . . . makes an unsatisfactory etymon both phonetically and semantically.” Spiegelberg maintained that in parallel Coptic examples an earlier /w/ had become a /b/. 50.

They maintained that the two Thebes had not flourished together since the thirteenth century and that Greeks could not have known anything about Egypt before the founding of Naucratis in the seventh century. For a bibliography, see Froidefond (1971, 31–3), who still accepts the source critics. I see no reason to doubt the authenticity of these lines, which were never challenged in antiquity. Their “fault” is ideological; they challenge Greek and European superiority. The Alexandrian scholars themselves sometimes challenged Homeric lines because they were inconvenient.

He never refers, however, to the possibility of a substantial number of loans into Latin from Semitic or Egyptian. 78. Carpenter (1958). This outlook was largely shared by Harden (1971), although he was the author of a disproportionately short chapter on the Phoenicians in the last edition of the Cambridge Ancient History. W. Culican (1991, 461–546) fully appreciated the Phoenicians’ importance and their Bronze Age roots. The CAH chapter ran after the one on the Babylonian exile of the Jews in the sixth century BCE. This placement preserves the idea of late Phoenician expansion. 79. See Albright (1975, 522–6) and Cintas (1948). 80. See the bibliography in Bunnens (1979, 281–2). Niemayer (1984, 1–94; 1988, 201–4) argues for late eighth century. Sabatino Moscati (1985, 179–87) attacks such minimalism. Moscati argues for Canaanite activities in the West Mediterranean in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries and Phoenician activity in the tenth. Basing his dating on epigraphical evidence, Cross (1979) argues for Phoenician expansion in the Mediterranean in the eleventh century.

Brown and Levin (1986, 95) write about this: “We cannot rule out the beautiful suggestion of Martin Bernal that, in view of the Etruscan-Punic contacts attested by the Pyrgi inscriptions, Ro\ma means “height, citadel” (i.e. the Capitoline Hill) and is related to Ahm;r;[råmåh] “height.” Brown now has reinforced my “radical proposal” with a number of other related Phoenician contacts with early Rome (2000, 209–10). See, also, Brown (1995, 24). The Mishnaic Hebrew and Aramaic form Rume\is clearly derived from the Greek Rwvmh. 91. See Procopius 1:19.29; Pliny Natural History 6:35. Arkell (1961, 178); Adams (1977, 384–92).
92. There is no reason why the Etruscan form of the name, Nethun, should be older than Neptune. Nethun is more likely to derive from Neptune than vice versa. Unfortunately, my friend and colleague John Pairman Brown (2000, 8) has misunderstood me on this issue. I have never suggested that Neptune’s name came from Nbt H≥t, Nephthys. 93. Dennis (1848, vol. 1, 109). See also Bernal (1997c, 156–7). 94. The name Thefarie Veliiunas. for the Etruscan ruler of Caere in the early sixth century BCE, was rendered Tbry’ wlns in the Phoenician version of the Pyrgi tablets. This rendering shows that the personal name Tiberius, presumably derived from Tiber, was very early. Bonfante and Bonfante (1983, 52–5). 95. See Chap. 5, n. 118. For the anti-Semitism involved in Beloch’s attempt to deny this obvious connection, see Chap. 1, n. 32, above, and Burkert (1992, 34). 96. Servius 7: 517. 97. See Hammond and Scullard (1970, 1038). The name Tarquin itself was derived from Tarh°°wun, the Anatolian thunder god. This is further evidence for the EtruscanAnatolian connection proposed by Herodotos and the majority of ancient writers. 98. Palmer ([1954] 1988, 13). 99. See Psalms 76: 5. 100. Pokorny (1959, vol. 1, 36). He does not, of course, go beyond Indo-European. 101. See Jakobson (1990, 305–12). 102. See Orel and Stolbova (1995, 239, no. 1065). 103. Given the substantial loaning from Latin to Irish there is no reason to suppose Irish suim(m) “sum, amount” is related genetically. 104. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 461 §§2186, 2188). 105. Strabo, 8: 3.19. Finding an example of the root in Anatolia, Fick (1905, 54, 112) declared the root to be “Lelegian.” 106. There is, however, one tantalizing possibility of an early borrowing. Related forms to the Latin terra “earth, land” are found not only in other Italic languages but also in Celtic. They provide one of the exclusive links between the two Western European language families. However, the Egyptian tÅ(*tr) “earth, land” is deeply rooted in the most archaic Afroasiatic languages; see Takács (1999, 228–9). Is this a simple coincidence or do both come from Proto-Nostratic [Bomhard and Kearns

(1994) does not include it] or is it an early loan from Afroasiatic to Proto-ItaloCeltic? 107. The papal encyclical formula “ad urbem et orbem” plays on this similarity. 108. Brown (2000, 218–24).
109. A puzzling use of wÅb to describe a sail could well refer to a sail furled, paralleling the meaning “swaddling clothes” written in the same way with the cloth radical. 110. Erman and Grapow (1926–53, vol. 1: 251); Gauthier (1925–30, vol. 1, 175). 111. The initial liquid may have had a suprasegmental influence on the /r/. In any event, introduction is a common linguistic feature; see the discussion on ku'do" in Chap. 14, nn. 45–50. 112. See Gauthier (1925, vol. 1, 99). 113. For a discussion of the prefix pr, see Chap. 9, nn. 125–66. For ntr, see Chap. 10, nn. 1–85. 114. I am grateful to my colleague Gary Rendsburg for persuading me to refer to this etymology.

Phonetic Developments in Egyptian, West Semitic and Greek over the Last Three Millennia BCE, as Reflected in Lexical Borrowings
1. Vycichl (1959, 70). 2. Herodotos 2: 55–6. For further discussion of this etymology, see Vol. 1, 65,78, 82 and 99 and English (1959), who to my knowledge was the first who proposed this etymology. 3. The proposed Indo-European cognates for kósmos are the Latin censeo\“to make a solemn declaration,” and the Sanskrit çám≥sati “he recites.” Both are wildly farfetched in their semantics. See Chap. 14, nn. 53–6, below. 4. Note the alternation of unvoiced and aspirated forms kh/p, k/ph. 5. The plausibility of semantic equation would be increased if one postulates Egyptian-speaking masters over Proto-Greek–speaking subordinates. 6. Frisk points out that kovlafo" was borrowed into Latin as colpus hence the Italian colpo and the French coup. 7. See Bernal (2001, 134–5). 8. See Lagarde (1866 1: 228). Burkert (1992, 39) wrote h°arba. The root is in fact ÷h≥rb not ÷h°rb and Aramaic does not possess the phoneme /h°/. The softer /h≥ / actually strengthens the etymology as /h°/ would be more likely rendered /kh/ or /k/ in Greek. 9. Lewy (1895, 177). See Chap. 7, n. 20 for more discussion of Lewy. 10. For a discussion of this, see Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 183) and Bernal (2001, 134–5).
11. See Chap. 16, nn. 61–3. 12. For the endless and pointless arguments as to whether Eblaite should be considered “East” or “West” Semitic, see the survey in Gelb (1981, 46–52). 13. See Goerwitz (1996, 489–97) and Daniels (1997, 22, 30). 14. See Chap. 5, nn. 196–8. 15. See also Bochart (1646, 1: 517) and Muss-Arnolt (1892, 58–60). The English

“typhoon” appears to have two sources: the Greek name through Arabic or Persian and a Cantonese daifung (dafeng) “great wind, gail.” I am grateful to Gary Rendsburg for persuading me to include this etymology. 16. For the dates of these shifts, see Harris (1939, 40–1). Also, see Chap. 5, nn. 82, 161, above, and Albright (1950, 165–6). 17. Greenberg (1962). 18. Gardiner (1957, 28 §19). 19. Ibid., 428. See Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 199) for their challenge on this issue. For my response, see (2001, 144). 20. Loprieno (1995, 61–2). Although I am happy to accept the quotation as it stands. I suspect that in the last sentence the author means “less” rather than “more” diversified. 21. Chap. 5, nn. 63–70, above. 22. For Ehret’s doubts on this, see Chap. 5, nn. 150–2, above. 23. The use of /d/ to represent the emphatic Semitic /s≥/ and /t≥/ was mentioned above Chap. 5, n. 82. 24. Loprieno (1995, 38). 25. For these confusions, see nn. 47–69 below. 26. See, for instance, Vergote (1971, 44). For a bibliography of earlier recognition that /Å/ was originally a liquid, see Vercoutter (1956, 20, n. 4). Vercoutter himself also accepted it as possible. Nevertheless, it was not known by Otto Rössler (1964, 213) or Carleton Hodge (1971, 13–4; 1977; 1992). These two independently published the same results. See Hodge (1997). 27. For a description of this debate, see Takács (1999, 333–44). 28. Orel and Stolbova (1995, xx). 29. Loprieno (1995, 31, 38) and Takács (1999, 50–8). 30. Loprieno (1995, 31, 38) and Kammerzell (1994a, 31). The value of /Å/ as a liquid is now accepted by informed classicists; see West (1997, xxiii). 31. Chap. 10, nn. 86–93. 32. Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 195). 33. For the textual and archaeological evidence, see Vol. 2, 409–94. For linguistic evidence, see n. 15 above and Chap. 5, nn. 83, 161–5. 34. Jan Assmann (1993, 400) argued that my proposal that mÅŒ could be borrowed into different Greek words both before and after the disappearance of the consonantal /Å/, somehow weakened my claim. I find such slack reasoning startling in so intelligent a scholar. 35. Hesiod, Theogony l: 180. 36. For the importance of these in harvesting, see Chap. 2, nn. 45–8. 37. The final -n is also found in Semitic. In Akkadian karânu is “vine.” 38. Frisk suggests the Lithuanian, “smith, hammer.” 39. I accept the conventional transcription of /w/, while remaining agnostic on Greenberg’s reinterpretation of the Coptic long vowels. See, above, n.16. 40. Frisk linked it to kwvmh “village,” which may have an Indo-European root, although he admits that the development of the meaning “should be conceived differently.” At one point Chantraine sees this connection as a mere possibility; at another he rejects kwvmh as an etymology for kwmw/dov".

41. Brugmann (1913, 317). 42. See Gardiner (1957, 491). 43. Cyrus Gordon (personal communication, 1998) accepted this etymology. The uncertainty of renderings of Egyptian /s=/ is discussed below, nn. 47–8. 44. Erman (1933, §153) and Lesko (1989, 4: 71). 45. For this as the origin of The\seús, see Chap. 5, n. 123, above. 46. See Takács (1999, 333–93). 47. For the comparable Greek correspondences with the Semitic /s=/, see Hopkins
(1976, 268), According to Rössler,  ̇ the sign conventionally rendered /h°/ was originally a voiced /g;/. Kammerzell, personal communication, Cambridge, Sept. 1995.
48. Kammerzell (1994a, 31). 49. See the examples given in Astour (1967a, 136). 50. For long-standing difficulties in interpreting the Coptic vowels conventionally, see n. 18 above. 51. More likely chvra derives from the Egyptian h/h°Årt “widow.” Chantraine prefers to link this to an Indo-European root ca- or ch- signifying deprivation. 52. Chantraine finds the etymology for this word “uncertain.” Frisk proposes a root *gher “to contain.” More likely corov" comes from the Egyptian h°rw “voice, noise” including “that of music.” 53. Iliad 2: 461.
54. See Chap. 15, below, nn. 88–9. 55. There is also the mysterious word s=åŒt. Faulkner enters it as “void?” but Lesko says “property?” If the latter it would tally with creivo" “need, poverty.” 56. Lest anyone should question the value of /s=/ as /h°/ in Late Egyptian, we should remind ourselves that first attestation of the word in this stage does not mean that it was not in use before. 57. For Eudemus, see West (1994, 290–1). For Pherecydes, see West (1971, 28–36; 1983, 103–5, 198–203).
58. Both Frisk and Chantraine admit that they have no etymology for nânos. For Egyptian and Greek views on and treatment of dwarfs, see Dasen (1993). It is possible that nmw is related to the southern Afroasiatic root *nam “man,” attested in East Chadic, Lowland East Cushitic and Omotic. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 398 §1841).
59. Van Windekins (1952, 142). 60. Kháos is, of course, the origin of our words “chaos” and “gas.” The seventeenthcentury Flemish chemist Johann Baptista van Helmont invested the latter term on the basis of chaos (pronounced ghas in Dutch). 61. See, for instance, Hornung (1982, 77). 62. Theogony, 116.

Of course, the names do correspond; I see this as an example of letter names being introduced centuries after the letters themselves. See Bernal (1990, 125–6). 75. See Westendorf (1962, 23) and Takács (1999, 284, 287). 76. See, for instance, the initial bnw>foinix and wÅh -ˆb RŒ> Ouafrh" both attested in Erman and Grapow ([1953] 1982, 6: 246–7). 77. See, for instance, Lejeune ([1972] 1987, 59). 78. For an example of this kind, see the case of GwEbel > Byblos mentioned, above, Chap. 5, nn. 159–61. A later form of q with the shaft dropped still further made the Roman Q. 79. Bernal (1990, 115–6). 80. Gamkrelidze and Ivanov (1995, 54–5). 81. Similar alternatives of /b/ and /p/ are found in Old and Middle High German. 82. Chadwick (1975, 808) stated that this was only possible for the dental series since voicing was not marked for the labial and velar stops. On analogical grounds, however, it seems plausible to suppose the latter shift at approximately the same time. 83. Whether in the Bronze Age phi was pronounced as an unvoiced aspirate /p-h/, as in the Classical and Hellenistic periods, or as a fricative /f/, as it was later, is irrelevant to this argument. 84. Vycichl found it difficult to explain the later Demotic and Coptic -w-. 85. For an Egyptian etymology for frhvn, see the discussion in Chap. 9, nn. 39–42. 86. Masson in Chantraine (1225). 87. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 376, 1736). 88. See Chap. 5, nn. 104–5, above. 89. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 376 §1730) and Takács (1999, 121). 90. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 375 §1727). 91. For a bibliography on this, see Cohen and Wallfield (1985). 92. Cohen and Wallfield (1985). 93. Levin (1995, 222–7). 94. Anttila (2000, 91). 95. The difference between the final -b in Semitic and p in Greek might seem to create a minor obstacle but the exchange is attested in transliterations in the list given by Astour (1967b, 293) in which the Hebrew /b/ was rendered, b, bb, p or f in Greek. Furthermore, as Dahood (1968, 126) pointed out specifically, “The numerous examples of the non-phonemic interchange between the sonant labial
NOTES TO PAGES 203–207 627



b and the mute labial p in Ugaritic and Phoenician authorize the biblical researcher to proceed on the assumption that a rigid distinction between these was not always maintained in Hebrew.” Anttila does not treat ajga- as an intensifying particle; Chantraine considers the etymology “uncertain.” There is a plausible explanation from the Egyptian iqr “excellent, splendid” which can explain many of the words Antilla derives from a[gw.
96. Anttila (2000, 82–90).

Greek Borrowings from Egyptian Prefixes, Including the Definite Articles
1. See Chap. 6, nn. 23–4. The possibility that the deictic masculine singular pn from which pÅ was reduced derived from a form found in Central Khoisan and ProtoAfroasiatic was mentioned in notes 119–39, Chap. 3. 2. These are simplifications of C+erny and Groll (1978, 41–2 §3.1.2; 43 §3.2; 44 §3.6.1). 3. See Gardiner (1957, 417–8). 4. See Chap. 8, nn. 75–6. 5. See Chap. 19, n. 20, and Astour (1967a, 313). 6.

Bomhard (1994, 127) sees the Nostratic initial ky[h] as corresponding to a PIE k[h]. I wonder if, in this case at least, the /i/ in the Teutonic words derives from an original glide. Skeat (1897) denies any relationship between kind and child. This denial is puzzling given the ease of shifts from l>n and vice versa. 12. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 526 § 2520). 13. See Hodge (1976b and 1991). 14. The ratio among Takács’s (1999, 86–92) examples is 15:5 for *l and 8:1 for *r. 15. Hodge (1976b and 1991, 172). 16. Chadwick (1973, 538). 17. For Ne\r from the Semitic nahr, see Chap. 14, nn. 33–4, below, and Chap. 7, n. 96, above, for its use in Latin toponymy. 18. See Chap. 5, n. 21, above. 19.

The /o\/ in the negative a[frwn “without frhvn” is plausibly explained by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov as the result of a “post-tonic e adjacent to a sonant.” They give other examples of this phenomenon (1995, 144, n. 15). 41.

Since the conventionally rendered Akkadian /s=/ corresponded to the Egyptian /s/, I have used the form Pasiyara. The vocalization of sr as *sir is strengthened by the Etruscan zil “ruler or magistrate,” which is surely a loan from the Egyptian sr. 61. Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 196). 62. See Chap. 8, n. 24. 63. Other cases exist where unvoiced stops have allowed the labial to be rendered as b- *pÅ ˆty “the sovereign”/bavtto" “king of Libya” and *pÅ hnw/banwtov" “vase.” 64.

Bernal (1987b, 14) and (1990, 115–6). 74. Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 196). There may be an example of an IndoEuropean labiovelar being written pa in Linear B. Chadwick (1973, 399) was still concerned about his and Ventris’s earlier conclusion (82) that the Greek pas/pan “all” was written with a pa when the conventional view was that it derived from a root *kwant-. Chantraine accepts that the Mycenaean spelling rendered this etymology “out of date.” He resorts to Tokharian B to find a plural form beginning with a p-. Frisk does not appear to have known about the “discovery” and retained his belief in the traditional, and admittedly very attractive, etymology. 75. For examples, see Lejeune ([1955] 1987, 46–7 § 33). 76. Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 204–5). 77. In modern Hebrew, foreign words are transcribed with quf and tet rather than the more frequent kaf and tav (although this may be to avoid spirantization when the latter forms are preceded by a vowel). In any event, the rarer letter indicates that the word is of foreign origin. The Japanese use of katakana syllabary to represent foreign words, rather than the far more common hiragana, is not the least bit ambiguous. 78.

I first proposed this etymology in 2001 (2001, 131). Alan Bomhard—Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 205–6)—sees the word fal(l)ov" (5) “phallus” as deriving from a Nostratic root, *bul-/*bol “swell, inflate” found in the Indo-European root *bhel/*bhol/*bhl2. E. Masson sees this as the source of fal(l)ov". Bomhard postulates a cognate Afroasiatic branch *bal-/*b ́l “swell, expand.” Takács (2001, 76–80), however, has found another Afroasiatic root, *b-l with the more specific meaning “penis.” He places the Egyptian bÅh≥ “phallus” there. He sees the final -h≥ “as an affix marking the semantic class of anatomical terms.” Thus, the Greek fal(l)ov" and

While lexicographers agree that “cant” derives from canare as can be seen in the sense of “singsong” or “whining,” it is more likely that in the sense “jargon” or “secret language” it comes from the Irish caint pronounced kan–t “talking, idiom.” This is a good example of a mixed etymology or “contamination.” Other examples of Irish words in English slang or cant include twig in the sense of “understand” from the Irish tuig “understand” and gob “mouth” from the Irish gob “beak.” 8.

(1969, 35–7) and Steiner (1977). 27. This also appears to be the semantic field of the mysterious word xouqov" associated with xánthos, for which Chantraine has no etymology. The variation indicates a loan for both. 28. Iliad 20: 74: 14.434; 21.2 and 24.693.

Does this indicate that he has abandoned his earlier hypotheses? The conventional view insisting on a Hellenic origin for such a crucial word.

Also, the Greek verb ejnevcw seems to derive from ejn- evcw “hold in,” although Chantraine does not list ejn as one of the prepositions used with e[cw. The various meanings of the ejnevcw and the stem ejnevcu- “pledge, security” would fit well with a central meaning of Œnh°“to link, imprison, bind” and, by extension, “oath.” In this instance, a double origin or what in traditional historical linguistics was called pejoratively “contamination” seems likely. 113.

that Isokrates’ statement was made largely to attack Plato’s attempt to monopolize the new term “philosophy.” I see a problem with this view in that, given Plato’s favorable view of Egypt, an Egyptian origin would enhance rather than diminish his new “discipline.” For a discussion of these issues, see Vol. 1: 103–8. 133.

A striking parallel exists between the Old Kingdom restriction of the Field of Rushes to pharaohs and the passage from the Odyssey (4: 561–70) in which the Egyptian seer Proteus assures Menelaus that he will go to Elysium not through merit but through his rank as the husband of Helen, hence the son-in-law of Zeus. Erwin Cook (1992, 254) points out the huge time span between the “democratization” of the Field of Rushes after the end of the Old Kingdom circa 2500 BCE and the Homeric text. He suggests plausibly that the old tradition had been preserved in Minoan Crete. For a summary of this scholarship, see Cook (1992); also see Alford (1991). 151. Alford (1991, 155–61).

Ernout and Meillet associate this with moenia “city protection.” I see this, too, as a probable loan from Semitic. 160. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 378 §1742).

Vycichl (1983, 105) estimates that during the New Kingdom the word had two pronunciations: *muaŒ with a short /u/and *mua–Œ with the u long. I think both can be seen as rounded mw.

165. In the light of this description, it is difficult to understand Jan Assmann’s statement: “Ma’at meint ungefahre das gegenteil von moira” (1993, 400). 166. The Mhriva (H) offered to the gods in Homer are generally thought to be thighs, and there is no doubt that this was, and is, the later sense of the word. In Homer, however, they seem to be the upper thighs, the haunches or hips. Me\ría would seem less likely to come from an Indo-European root *memsra, found in the Latin membra, than from the Canaanite stem attested in Ugaritic as mr>a and in Hebrew as mErî>. In these languages, it is translated as “fatling,” a term used almost exclusively in reference to sacrifice. It would in fact seem ultimately related to the root ÷mwr. 167. Pausanias 10: 24.4. 168.

178. There are a number of interesting synonyms for wn h≥r as “dream,” including rswt “awakening” and wpt mÅŒt “to reveal the truth.” 179. It was generally used to translate faivnein. 180. For the shift w>u found in Coptic, see Loprieno (1995, 50). 181. For a discussion of these proposals, see Chantraine hupar and hypnos, s.v. 182. Another example of the same process would seem to be the Egyptian ht°m “sealed, completed” and the Greek hetoimos “ready, realized, effective.” Transmission through Canaanite is attested in the Hebrew h≥at–am “sealed, completed.” The exact form of the root is uncertain but it may have been through the future form yih.to\m with the aspiration being shifted to the initial. In any event, h≥at\am provides a strong etymology for hetoimos, for which no Indo-European root has been found. 183. Zelig Harris (1939, 44) describes the Phoenician development of /u–/ as “late.” Segert (1997, 197) makes no such qualification. The only method for identifying early Phoenician vowels is from Akkadian cuneiform in which both /o–/ and /u–/ were written as u. Thus, the change could have taken place well before the attestation of /u–/ in Greek or Roman letters. A possible problem is that Phoenician also experienced a shift of short a > o. No one has determined whether this came before the shift /o–/ to long /u–/. This example would suggest that the shift short a > o came later and that the loan into Greek was made between the two shifts. 184. Vandersleyen (1986). Dreams could be spontaneous or deliberately provoked by “incubation,” sleeping in particular sacred places. After which specialized priests interpreted them. The historian of Egyptian medicine J. F. Nunn, who takes a minimalist view of Egyptian cultural achievements, says that Egyptian forms of incubation were derived from Greece (1996, 110–1). He does not refer to Vandersleyen’s sources. The latter writes, “this practice has been considered the fruit of a late development, because it is abundantly documented in the Ptolemaic epoch, particularly as a means of healing . . . in fact it seems that it was already at work, at least since the First Intermediate Period and in the New Kingdom. 185. Many of the references are, in fact, to dreams interpreted by Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 40–1).

I now believe, however, that I used misplaced precision in my ultra-late dating of the correspondence s/skh. 12.

Stracmans (1985) and Montes (2001, 198–9). 22. *Bz as “protect” may well be the origin of the bz in the official title Wr bzt, guardian of the treasury. Pace Takács (2002, 295) who tentatively connects it to the Semitic *>bs/*>bs[“fill with food.” 23. Afroasiatic cognates for ÷bz can be found in most of these meanings. See also Chap. 10, above, for a reference to Bessoi, from *bsw initiates. 24. Chantraine sees it as derived from phvgnumi “fix.” This would be strange, although not impossible, for a moment of enlightenment, whereas bs “initiate” would be entirely appropriate for pavx and for the Latin exclamation pax as well as the noun pax/pacis itself. Ernout and Meillet have great difficulties in providing an IndoEuropean etymology for this. 25. Altenmüller (1975a). 26. Ehret (1995, 89, no. 33). 27. See Vol. 2, 166–71. 28. This is not included in Gardiner’s sign list. Cervelló (1996, 79) brings out the links between terrifying lion masks and contemporary African rituals of circumcision and the demonic appearance of Be–s. 29. Takács (2001, 293) also mentions the Somali bod–“gray horse,” and the ProtoCentral-Khoisan *bize “zebra.” Bize, with metathesis, provides a plausible etymology for the European “zebra” through the Portuguese in southern Africa. The conventional derivation of the word is “Ethiopian” is made less likely by the Amharic word for the animal: yämeda abEyya. 30. Takács (2001, 299).

It is possible that wdn is cognate to the Semitic ÷wld “give birth.” Orel and Stolbova (1995, 530 §2540) postulate this. There is also the East Cushitic root *widyal. Within Afroasiatic the direction of the metathesis is impossible to detect. Evidence from Indo-European indicates that ÷wld was the original form. See Chap. 9, nn. 11–4, above.

12. What appears to be a metathesis, sahala “shave off,” exists in Ge ́ez and in the Tigrinya sähäla and, elsewhere, in the Beja sehal. 13. Lewy (1895, 181). Curtius (1879, 196) saw a relationship between skulao\and sulao\, but assumed they were Indo-European. 14. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 485 §2304). Thus, it is clearly connected to their root §2244 *sim “to call, speak”; see Orel and Stolbova (1995, 473). 15. Bomhard constructs a Nostratic root *>in-im/>in-em “call, name” found in the Indo-European *(H)ne–mn9/*(H)no–mn9/(H)nomn9 “name,” as well as in Uralic and Sumerian. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 687–8, §569). He found no Afroasiatic examples. See, however, Chap. 5, n. 97 above. 16. Chap. 5, nn. 124–5, above. 17.

See also Chap. 19, n. 77, for the possibility of “contamination” from the Egyptian h°pr. 36. Chap. 20, n. 43, below. 37. A good case can be made for reconstructing Proto-Nostratic *Ò and emphatic *Ò.¢A form illustrating the first can be seen in the parallel between the Semitic ÷s;ph “lip” and the Latin labia/labra and the Old English lippa, possibly also suggesting a plosive p’, hence, *PNost ÷Òp’ and PIE ÷ lVp’. Steiner (1977, 111–22) has shown that the Arabic letter d≥a\d was an emphatic lateral fricative corresponding to an emphatic form of the Hebrew si;n. Thus, the Hebrew ÷ sh≥q -s;h≥q “laugh” derives from a Proto-Semitic form retained in the Arabic ÷d≥h≥q. Steiner does not consider the possibility that these could be cognate to the Gothic hlahjan “laugh,” which is conventionally and dubiously related to the Late Latin clango\“bird cry.” For the existence of laterals in Khoisan, see Güldemann and Vossen (2000, 107–8).

For the Euroasiatic, see Greenberg (2000, 200–2). For Semitic, see Moscati et al. (1969, 154) and, for Egyptian, see Loprieno (1995, 53–4). It is tempting to see the vocalic contrast between “fall” and “spill,” “part” and “split,” “tang” and “sting” and, possibly, “cramp” and “scrimp” as an additional causative marker. The Canaanite s/hiphil uses both.

More Semitic Loans into Greek
1. Chap. 7, nn. 16–29, above. 2. Masson (1986a, 201). This statement is not true of Lewy’s 1928 article. 3. Benveniste ([1935] 1948, 156). 4. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 39 §157). The root may be deeper still. Blench (in press a, 9) reconstructs a root #∫wong “come” for Congo-Saharan. Most of the forms in both Nilo-Saharan and Niger Congo are simply *bV. Saul Levin believes it probable that the Hebrew bå> derives from a “relatively late” borrowing from “an IE area where the labiovelar had [like Greek] been simplified in this particular manner.” This explanation seems far-fetched, and Levin admits that the wide distribution of ÷b> within the Ethiopic Semitic languages makes it still more improbable. He sees the one example of the root ÷b> outside Semitic, the Beja bi? as “presumably borrowed from Arabic” (1995, 159–60). He is unaware of the deep Afroasiatic and African roots mentioned above. 5. Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 195). 6. Bomhard and Kerns (1994, 263 §72). 7. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 147 §637). 8. Liddell and Scott refer to the second sense as being employed “more commonly.” 9. Chap. 5, nn. 168–90, above. 10. Chap. 5, nn. 157–8, above. 11. Chantraine is not convinced of an etymology for this from an Indo-European root *gwel “swallow.” Pokorny (1959, 365) only finds it attested by the Greek délear. It is also possible that the sense of dólos “trick” was influenced by a West Semitic form found in the Arabic dal “coquetry.” The semantic puzzle provided by the Latin words doleo “suffer,” doli–um “pottery vessel” and dolus “trickery” can be explained by borrowings from the Canaanite ÷dl in the senses “depend, suspend and entangle,” either through Greek and South Italic languages or directly. 12. See, for instance, Sturtevant (1940, 91).

46. Jasanoff and Nussbaum (1996, 196–7). 47.

Hoch (1994, 24–5 §12). 46. Jablonsky (1804, 272) and Wiedmann (1883, 37). 47. This appears to be derived from a Nostratic root *t’p found in the Germanic “top” and “tip.” Bomhard (1994, 97) insists that the Egyptian reflex of the Nostratic and Proto-Afroasiatic emphatic /t’/ is /d/. Takács, however, provides examples where PAA /t’/ became /t/ in Egyptian (1999, 231–4). 48. Iliad 2: 765.

87. The existence of Arabic and Sabaean words hgn meaning precisely the opposite “unclean” etc.—the constant double edge of “sacred”—indicates that the triliteral is well rooted in Asiatic Semitic and, therefore, the Canaanite and Aramaic forms are very unlikely to be loans from Greek. 88. See Bernal (2001, 339). 89. For the Egyptian attestations, see Ranke (1935, 1: 326–7) and Junker (1917, 107).
90. The Ugaritic divinity of the sun, Sps who was feminine, presumably through Hurrian influence, may have received her name from an amalgam of sapsi with the Semitic semes “sun.” Astour (1967a, 103, n. 1) linked the Ugaritic title to the ancient name of Mount Arakhneion in the Argolid, which according to Pausanias (2: 25, 10) was Sapiselaton. While he is undoubtedly right to see the second element as the Semitic >elat “goddess,” the whole would seem more likely to be an Egypto-Canaanite doublet *saps->elat, “sacred goddess,” possibly Athena as the patron of “weaving” and the later name Arakhneion “spider.” 91.

Vycichl wrote a thoughtful note on the Coptic borrowing from the Greek kibot\os “coffer, box.” He pointed out that the Greek word has no etymology but is likely to have been borrowed from Semitic and cites the Hebrew te\ba “coffer, box” (for the relationship of this word with the city name of Thebes, see Chap. 19, below). Vycichl noted an Old Egyptian word tb “cage, case for birds” from which he reconstructed a form *kiba or *kuba, which he saw as “very close to the Greek word. C+erny attempted to explain the Coptic words taibe and te\e\be “coffin, shrine, chest.” He was inclined to see them as deriving from two Egyptian roots dbÅt “shrine coffin” and dbt “chest, box.” Vycichl’s conclusion is that although “the links cannot be formally demonstrated, the use of sufficiently similar words . . . speaks rather in favor of a common origin.” 130.

very early in Old Irish and final -st became -s, which in turn was uncertain in Ogam inscriptions and disappeared in later Irish. See Thurneysen (1949, 110 §177). Thus, the preservation of the geminated -ss would seem to indicate a borrowing from the Latin cista. 139. Orel and Stolbova (1995, 317 §1454). 140. The Coptic ko–o–s appears as govo" (H) “funeral lament” from which the verb goavw “to lament” derived.

152. Astour (1967a, 239). The Arabic raf–a>–and the Ge’ez rf> mean “stitch together.” This form provides a plausible etymology for the Greek rJavptw “sew.” The discovery of a Mycenaean form erapamena has ruined previous attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology. 153.

158. Frisk states, “without an etymology” and goes on to list some hypotheses he does not accept. Chantraine writes that phonetically “it seems to have an IndoEuropean origin” but simply cites, without comment, some of those referred to by Frisk. Both scholars are skeptical of Szemerényi’s attempt (1954, 159–65) to link it to mevlo" “music.” This word too has no Indo-European etymology. It would seem plausible to derive it from an Egyptian root *mr, possibly attested in mrt “female singer, musician” (Erman and Grapow, 2: 107) and certainly found in Mrt, a goddess of music. 159. Pokorny (1959, 753) links it to a root mer “shimmer, sparkle.” Chantraine tentatively accepts a relationship with the Latin for–ma despite the necessity of metathesis and difficulties with the long o.–He also admits that Ernout sees for–ma as a borrowing from morf- possibly through Etruscan. In short, both scholars see both words as loans.

In Chap. 22, n. 242 I shall argue that Mount Lukabhttov" to the east of Athens derives its name from the Egyptian toponym Åht° ˆÅbt “luminous region in the east, where the sun rises.” WilamowitzMoellendorff (1927, 43, n. 2) argued that “it is difficult to separate lykabas from Lykabe\ttos.” In this case lykabas would mean “dawn” which would fit the action of the epic and Penelope’s insistence on early morning in the verses following Odysseus’s second use of the term (19: 306) 38.

It would seem likely that the Latin summa “topmost” derived from s=mm. Ernout and Meillet attempt to make a genetic link between summa and the Irish suim with the same meaning.

Bietak noted the two parallel epithets: “Beloved of Seth, lord of Avaris” and “Beloved of Seth, lord of R-Åh≥tœ.” He also points to the Middle Kingdom place-name R-wÅty. 143.

147. Pausanias 3: 22.2. The name Gythion would seem to be connected to Gythissôn which Hesykhios defines as dioryssôn “trenching or canal.” This could make it a derivation from the Egyptian place-name element Gt meaning “canal or basin.” See Gauthier (1925–31, 5: 221). Such a sense would be appropriate to Gythion’s swampy situation by the sea and early attempts to irrigate it. For a picture of this delta in prehistoric and early historic times and the density of its population, see Cartledge (1979, 20). 148. Strabo 9: 440, 640. See also Fick (1905, 105). 149.

Fick (1905, 75) claimed that the presence of the toponym in Anatolia meant that it was Carian. He gave no explanation of the name. 159. Harris (1939, 40–1). 160. See Albright (1950, 165–6). 161. Lloyd (1978). 162. For discussions of this, see Lloyd (1978, 617) and Griffiths (1975, 47). Sometimes the bull appears to be leaping at others. Notably at Medum, a line goes from the beast’s forefoot over his head. Griffith interprets this as a lasso or hobble. 163. Stricker (1955) and Altenmüller (1975b). Stricker emphasizes the centrality of catharsis “purification” in these dramatic performances. He does not consider the possibility that this word, which has no Indo-European etymology might itself come from Egyptian. See Chap. 10, nn. 72–6, above.

This word is, of course, the same as Sepharad, the Medieval Hebrew name for Spain. Allegedly this naming was based on a misinterpretation of the prophesy in Obadiah 20, referring to Sardis.

Pallotino (1956, 230). Bonfante and Bonfante (1983, 144) define it as “people, league.” 19. See Chap. 8, nn. 46–8. The Hebrew mas “labor gang” is probably a later borrowing from the Egyptian ms=, although Klein (1987) tentatively derives it from the Egyptian ms(w) “carriers.” Ellenbogen (1962) does not list it. 20. For the fullest studies of this, see Kees (1923) and Gardiner (1947, 2: 127–8). See, for instance, Coffin Texts, 227.

This statement leaves open the question of whether or not Dorians were in Lakonia in the Late Bronze Age as Dietrich (1975, 141) maintains.

The lexicographers of Greek are uneasy about the etymology of iris linking it tentatively to a Teutonic wir and the English “wire”! They pay no attention to Gardiner’s obvious suggestion (1957, 443) that it comes from the Egyptian irt “eye” which Plutarch transcribed as iri (De Iside, 10). The circle in the eye was named “iris” from this and the flower name seems to derive from that meaning. The Greek iris “rainbow” seems to come from iridescent circle and that gave us Iris, “messenger of the gods.” 102. Nonnos, 19: 103–5, tr. Rouse (1940, 2: 99). Staphylos, “grape,” was a biname of Dionysos himself. It is doubtful that Nonnos was aware that the Greek wordunexplained in terms of Indo-European—probably derived from the Egyptian stp “choose.” See Chap. 15, nn. 47–8.

On the other hand, the festival of Hyakinthia and Hyakinthia the month in which it took place was known in virtually every Doric state. 106. The variant forms of Hyakinthia—Iakinthis found on Tenos (Inscriptiones Graecae 12: 5) and Kyakinthoi from Lyktos in Crete—do not seem to me sufficient evidence for positing another initial. 107. Chap. 10, nn. 5–46. 108. For a discussion of Káanthos and his possible relation with Kadmos, see Fontenrose (1959, 317–9). See also Chap. 10, nn. 74–9. 109. Frazer (1914, 1: 1–30). Frazer (p. 226) saw the anemone created by the blood of Adonis as coming from the Semitic NaŒaman “darling,” a common epithet for Adonis. Ajax was supposed to have died the Iris with his blood. 110. See Chadwick (1976) and Hooker (1976, 179). 111. This account would also fit the Ancient Model’s view of Mycenaean society as a foreign imposition rather than the Aryan Model’s view of it as a native growth. 112. Cartledge (1979, 53). 113. Cartledge claims (1979, 78) pace Chadwick that Thucydides distinguished between Dorians and “returning” Heraklids. He adds evidence from Tyrtaios to back this. Tyrtaios’ lines, however, cannot be used as a basis for a claim that the Dorians invaded or infiltrated a century later than the “return.” Thucydides (1: 12.3) specified that the Dorians came in with the Heraklids. 114.

One of the bases for his defiance of the ancient views, which all put the Spartan lawgiver before 776, is that the reforms associated with him required writing, which he believes only developed in Greece in the eighth century. 118. Mid-twentieth-century scholarship tended to date such finds to a later time. See Boardman (1963, 7). Even Cartledge admits this (1979, 119–20). See also Forrest (1963, 31–2) and Coldstream (1977, 159–63). 119. Plutarch Lycurgus 4: 3–6.

conclusions regarding Crete by saying that similar Phoenician contacts were not important at Athens and Lefkandi, where Greek enterprise began. I find it impossible to believe that the Athenian Middle-Geometric—which began at the same time as Cretan Proto-Geometric B—was not similarly influenced by Phoenician imports from this period in both Attika and Euboea (see Coldstream [1977, 5568]). Furthermore, we know from Homer that the main imports from the Levant in his time were “Sidonian” decorated textiles, none of which have survived. Since Coldstream wrote his speculations, Sarah Morris’s magisterial work (1992, esp. 101–49) has demonstrated substantial Phoenician influences around the Aegean in the Early Iron Age. 125.

Plutarch Lycurgus 28:1 is unconvincing when he denies that Lykurgos could have had anything to do with the Krypteia, the secret police used to maintain the subjugation of the Helots.

Arabic has both h°awr and h≥awr for “pit.” The former would tally better with the Greek and Etruscan initials but it is not necessary to justify the loan. Another link between H≥o\ro\n and Charun is that the latter is depicted with a hammer [Dennis (1848, 1: 310) and Pallattino (1956, 171)].

162. While accepting the letter’s authenticity, Elizabeth Rawson achieved the same effect as Momigliano by innuendo. Referring to the reception of the first Jewish letter quoting Areios’ earlier one, she wrote: “a friendly but possibly rather surprised reply from the Spartan authorities is later recorded” (1969, 96). The letter, in I Macc. 14: 21, has no noticeable trace of surprise. Peter Green (1990, 513), writes in the same vein, when describing the High Priest Jason (Joshua) as “finally dying in exile in, of all places, Sparta [my italics].” 163. Meyer (1921, 30).

1. The tradition dates back at least to Bunsen (1848–60, 5: 1: 22). It was still upheld by Robert Graves (1955, 44–5). 2. Gauthier (1925–31, 4: 100). 3. Emery (1961, 51). 4. See El Sayed (1982, 192–3). 5. Herodotos 4: 189, tr. de Selincourt (1974, 334). 6. Gardiner (1957, 542). The form with tassles is used by Erman and Grapow. It is interesting that Lesko lists one form of Œprw as “tassles.” 7. Ventris and Chadwick (1973, 375, 380). The Egyptian and Cretan signs are much closer to each other than the latter is to those found at Pylos, which seems to include the helmet.

The earliest chain mail was found or attested in writing in the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries BCE. See Yadin (1963, 84–5). Links of chain mail were found in Shaft Grave 5 at Mycenae. It was widespread and more common than plate armor throughout the Late Bronze Age. See Catling (1970). 9. Chap. 8, n. 65 and Chap. 10, nn. 119–20. 10. See Keimer (1931) and El Sayed (1982, 23–4). During the time in Saite, the shield lost its curves. 11. El Sayed (1982, 13), Emery (1961, 66–9), Gardiner (1961, 411–2) and Hoffman (1991, 320–4).
12. Montet (1957, 75–7) and Gauthier (1925–31, 4: 88). 13. It seems to have been distinct from the other common symbol of Neith: two bows in either a sheath or in a shuttle or maybe in both. This symbol was used in a hieroglyph of her name. It was also an important religious sign in Libya where it continues to appear on tattoos. Bates (1914, 139). 14. Newberry (1906).
15. Evans (1921–35, 2: 52).
16. For a discussion of the dating, see Lorimer (1950, 143). Lorimer believed the figure to be “female and divine.” 17. The first to make the connection appears to have been E. Gardiner (1893).

Homer (Iliad 6: 303) visualized the statue of Athena at Troy as seated. 21. Nilsson (1967, 406). Interestingly, Nilsson links the effigy to the Gephyroi family whom Herodotos had identified as Phoenicians. The ancient historian said they had followed Kadmos to Thebes and then moved to Athens. See Herodotos, 5: 57–8.

Herodotos 2: 182. According to the historian Xenagoras, the temple in Lindos had an inscription in Egyptian hieroglyphics. See Jacoby (1923–58, 3b, 240.F.16). Lloyd (1988, 237) doubts Herodotos’ claims that there was no personal relationship between Amasis and Kleobolos, although he is willing to concede that there may have been earlier traditions of contact between Lindos and the Danaids from Egypt. For Kleobolos’ friendship with Solon and his contact with “philosophies in Egypt,” see Diogenes Laertius 1: 89–93. 30. Herodotos 2: 182. Alan Lloyd, in his commentary on the second book of Herodotos’ Histories (1988, 235) sees a contradiction between views of the French scholar, F. Chamoux who believed that the statue was Greek in style, and the observations of the Italian L. Vitali who saw it as Egyptian. There is no way of resolving this disagreement. In any event, the artistic styles would not have been so far apart in the sixth century and the theological identification of the Egyptian and Greek goddesses was complete. 31. Herodotos 3: 47, tr. de Selincourt (1974, 223). Pliny (Natural History, 14: 2) described the corslet of Lindos as having 365 threads. The passage from Herodotos is also important because it contains one of the earliest references to cotton [eijrivoisi ajpo;xuvlou “wool from a tree”]. For a discussion of this corslet, see Picard (1957, 363). (I am indebted to Anthony Snodgrass for this reference.) There is no reason to doubt that cotton was grown in Egypt at this period. It may, in fact, date back much further. See Chowdhury (1971). 32. The Suppliants 50; see Picard (1957, 365). 33. Iliad 2: 529, see the discussion in Picard (1957, 369).

Allan Lloyd disagrees (1976, 280–2) and says that “the myths and rituals at Esna were closely modelled on those at Sais” and that, therefore, they could be used for assessing the ritual calendar in the Lower Egyptian city. El Sayed too (1982, 1: 45) believes that one can and should use the abundant records at Esna to reconstruct rituals for which no evidence can be found at Sais. 71. Lloyd (1976, 281) and Gardiner (1957, 489). 72. This would explain why Herodotos stated that the festival was called Lykhnokaie\ “lighting of lamps.” Lloyd (1976, 282) writes condescendingly, “It simply did not occur to him that the Egs. may have had their own name.” 73.

In these various fiery contexts Athena was known as Hellôtis. Farnell (1895–1909, 1: 278) is willing to accept the hypothesis of the twelfth-century author of the Etymologicum Magnum that Hello\tis derives from a Semitic Elloti “goddess.” Astour (1967a, 139), however, derived this name from the Semitic hll. He cites the Akkadian form Elletu. Yet another possibility is that an early loan from the Egyptian srf and Semitic srp contaminated the name. The Semitic word means “flame, heat, light” and is found with the specific sense of “torch” in the Demotic srrf. This would seem to have been borrowed later as the Greek is sevla", descriptive of the brilliance of fires, and torches. 78. See Astour (1967a, 135, 269–70).

109. Fontenrose (1959, 274–306, esp. 300–1). There are, in fact, other parallels between Perseus and Apollo to which Fontenrose does not draw attention: both are sons of Zeus, hidden by being set adrift with a female twin. The confusion of generations in the Perseus myth makes Danae seem much more like a sister than a mother. All in all, Perseus “the destroyer” would seem to be an aspect of Apollo, very much like Resheph in the Canaanite pantheon. For further discussion of Apollo and Artemis, see above Chap. 19. 110. See n. 57 above. 111. “The Shield” lines 225–6. Frazer’s translation is in a quotation from Apollodoros 2: 4.2. Interestingly, kavrh “head” could be either singular or plural in epic Greek. The verse goes on to describe what is translated as “bright tassles of gold (that) hung down”—quvsanoi “tassles.” For the etymology of the word from the Egyptian ts “knot,” see Chap. 18, nn. 39–40. These tassles are restricted in the Iliad to those of Athena’s aigis, which, according to Herodotos (4: 189), was a flayed goat skin. (See above). 112. Œnt 2: 8–13, trans.

She does not consider the possibilities (1) of archaism and (2) that the Egyptian name could have been introduced to Greece in the Bronze Age. 166.

177. Diodoros 1: 29.4. Apollodoros 3: 15.4 refers to legendary connections between Eumolpos, the eponym of the Eumolpids, and Ethiopia “if not Egypt.” Burton (1972, 126).
178. Anne Burton maintains (1972, 11) that the story of a Saitian colony at Athens may have begun with Plato or Theopompos in the fourth century BCE. Christian Froidefond, however, argues (1971, 276) that the stories were current at the time of Herodotos. Given the cultic parallels referred to above, I see no reason to doubt Plato’s report (Timaeus 21E) that the Saitians welcomed Solon as an Athenian kinsman early in the sixth century. 179.

208. The name could derive from *inb qd “wall builder.” This is not attested, although qd inb with the same sense is. Although amphi as “both” has a strong Indo-European etymology, it would parallel the Canaanite suffix åyim> ai; see Chap. 20, n. 104. In the sense of “around,” amphi in city names could well come from inb “city wall.” Qd “to build, construct” may be the origin of the Greek ktizô “to found cities.” 209. Diodoros 1: 29.

GLOSSARY 695
GLOSSARY
Africa Africa fits the conventional definition of a continent as a large land mass surrounded by water. Like the concept of “continent” itself the definition of Africa is problematic. It contains a range of climates, from desert to rainforest and is divided by many natural boundaries, though these have shifted over the millennia, making contacts among the various climatic regions over time more possible than they are today. As the continent in which modern humans have lived longest, it has a wider genetic variation than all the rest of the world put together. There is, however, a surprising degree of linguistic uniformity. Thus, all in all, Africa remains too useful a concept to be deconstructed.
Afroasiatic Otherwise known as Afrasian and formerly called HamitoSemitic, this linguistic super-family consists of a number of language families including Beja, Berber, Chadic, Egyptian, Semitic, Omotic and Central, Eastern and Southern Cushitic.
Ainu People surviving in northern Japan. Their language is thought to be an independent branch of Euroasiatic.
Akkadian The Semitic language of Mesopotamia heavily influenced by Sumerian. It was replaced by Aramaic around the middle of the First Millennium BCE.



696 BLACK ATHENA
Alphabet A particular form of script in which signs uniquely represent single phonemes. Nearly all known alphabets derive from a single form developed in Egypt or the Levant, in the Third Millennium BCE. The only exceptions to this pattern are a very few created by analogy to those descended from the original alphabet. The outstanding examples of the latter type are the Irish Ogham and the Korean alphabets.
Altaic Widespread language family in Central Asia, including Turkic, Mongol and possibly Tungus and Korean. It is thought to be an independent branch of Euroasiatic.
Amharic This Ethiopian Semitic language is the national language of Ethiopia.
Anatolia Ancient region more or less co-extensive with modern Turkey.
Anatolian Extinct Indo-Hittite but non–Indo-European languages of Anatolia. They include Hittite, Palaic, Luvian, Lycian, Lydian and probably Carian and Etruscan.
Aramaic A West Semitic language. Originally spoken in parts of what is now Syria, it became the official language of the Assyrian, NeoBabylonian and Persian empires. It replaced the Canaanite dialects of Phoenician and Hebrew in the East Mediterranean around the middle of the First Millennium BCE. In its turn it was replaced by Greek and Arabic.
Archaic Greece Greek historical period conventionally dated from the first Olympic Games in 776 BCE to the beginning of the Classical Age around 500 BCE.
Armenian Indo-European language of an ancient people in eastern Anatolia. It is sometimes supposed to be especially close to Greek. As the earliest Armenian texts only go back to the fourth century CE, the similarities may only be due to Greek influence or common contacts with Semitic languages.
Aryan Term derived through the Semitic œary from the Egyptian ˆrˆ, “companion.” The people later called Persians described themselves as



GLOSSARY 697
Arya. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars used the term to denote speakers of an Indo-Aryan or Indo-Iranian branch of the IndoEuropean language family. These people appear to have invaded Iran and India from the northwest in the first half of the Second Millennium BCE. In the late nineteenth century CE the term came to be used for the “Indo-European” or “white race” specifically excluding Jews.
Asia A name derived from the western Anatolian state of Assuwa in the Second Millennium BCE. Among the Greeks, the term was used both for Anatolia (Asia Minor) and for the whole continent across the sea, to the east of Greece. Strictly speaking, neither Asia nor Europe count as continents as they are not surrounded by water. Furthermore, Asia is divided by permanent geographical barriers and is populated by peoples with very distinct languages and cultures.
Assyria An ancient city-state or kingdom in northern Mesopotamia. It dates back to the Third Millennium BCE. Its periods of greatest power were at the end of the Second Millennium and between 900 and 600 BCE. Its language was an archaic dialect of Akkadian.
Atlantic languages Branch of Niger-Congo spoken along the west coast of Africa. One branch, Fulani, is spoken in pockets as far east as Cameroon.
Autochthonous Native or aboriginal.
Bantu By far the largest branch of the Niger-Congo language family. It is spoken from Cameroon in the west to Kenya in the east and South Africa in the south. It appears to have expanded in the last 3,000 years.
BCE Before the Common Era. “Common” refers to the use of the Gregorian calendar, the most “common” calendar in the modern world.
Beja Branch of Afroasiatic spoken for at least the past 5,000 years in eastern Egypt and the Red Sea coast of the Sudan.
Berber The Afroasiatic language family once spoken throughout northwest Africa. It is still spoken in pockets from the Western Desert of Egypt to Morocco and Mauritania.



698 BLACK ATHENA
Besserwisserei The German for “knowing better” refers to a scholarly approach based on the belief that the alleged “science” and “scholarly method” of nineteenth- and twentieth-century historians made their conclusions categorically superior to those of ancient writers.
Book of Coming Forth by Day Better known as The Book of the Dead, this compilation of spells and instructions guides the soul of the deceased through the journey of the afterlife.
Bronze Age Modern term for the period when bronze, a copper alloy usually with tin, was used for tools and weapons. Iron largely replaced bronze. In southwest Asia and around the eastern Mediterranean the period lasted from approximately 3500–1100 BCE. In east Asia and western Europe it started and ended later. Most of Africa went straight from a stone age to an iron age.
Byblos Ancient port city in what is now southern Lebanon. In close touch with Egypt, it was the most important Levantine city until eclipsed by Sidon at the end of the Second Millennium BCE.
Calque A literal translation of a word, expression or idiom from another language. “Snow peas” from the Chinese xuedou “snow peas” is an example. “Toufu” from the Chinese doufu or the Japanese toufu is not a calque but a loan.
Canaanite A Semitic language influenced by Ancient Egyptian. It was spoken in the southern Levant between 2000 and 500 BCE, when it was displaced by Aramaic. Phoenician and Hebrew are the best known later Canaanite dialects. “Canaanite” is also used by archaeologists to describe the material culture of southern Syro-Palestine, circa 1500-1100 BCE.
Carian Language spoken in southwest Anatolia. It was probably Anatolian but it may have been non–Indo-Hittite. Alphabetic inscriptions date from the sixth century BCE.
CE Common Era. This term is used by non-Christians in general and Jews in particular to avoid the sectarianism of AD, Anno Domini “in the year of our Lord.”



GLOSSARY 699
Central Cushitic A branch of Afroasiatic. It is spoken in pockets of northern Ethiopia.
Central Khoisan A cluster of Khoisan languages spoken in Namibia and Botswana with the feature of binary gender found also in Hadza.
Ceramic period A duration of time reconstructed by archaeologists on the basis of potter styles.
Chadic Branch of Afroasiatic with many languages stretching from the Central African Republic and Cameroon to northern Nigeria.
Classical Greece Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. It is generally held to have seen the greatest and “purest” products of Greek genius.
Colchis Country at the eastern end of the Black Sea in present Georgia.
Coptic Language of Christian Egypt spoken until the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries CE. Coptic remains the liturgical language of Egyptian Christians or Copts. It is written in the Greek alphabet with some additional letters derived from Demotic.
Cuneiform A script developed in Mesopotamia using nail-shaped reed ends pressed into wet clay. The clay is then baked. The script was employed for various languages in southwest Asia from the Fourth Millennium BCE. It survived in Mesopotamia into the Common Era.
Cushitic A hypothetical branch of Afroasiatic situated in the Horn of Africa; see more under its families: Central, East and South Cushitic.
Cypriot Syllabary Syllabary distantly related to the Cretan Linear A and used on Cyprus into Hellenistic times.
Dark Ages (Christian) Name conventionally given to the period after the fall of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE and before the “Middle Ages” generally considered to have begun in the ninth and tenth centuries.



700 BLACK ATHENA
Dark Ages (Greek) Name given to the period after the fall of the Mycenaean palaces in the twelfth century BCE and before the rise of Archaic Greece in the eighth.
Demotic Strictly speaking Demotic is the script derived from Hieroglyphic used in Egypt after the seventh century BCE. The term is also used to describe the Egyptian language of the period. Without a capital letter the word indicates a language spoken by ordinary people regardless of time and place.
Dentals Consonants formed with the tongue against the teeth as, for example, /d/ and /t/.
Determinative Element in hieroglyphic representation that signifies the meaning of a word as opposed to its sound.
Diffusionism Belief that cultural characteristics can be transmitted from one culture to another, the opposite of isolationism. See also modified diffusionism.
Diodoros Sikeliotes (Diodorus Siculus) Greek historian from Sicily circa 80–20 BCE; he was known for his Library of History.
Dorians Greek tribe from northwest Greece who overran much of southern Greece in the twelfth century BCE.
Dravidian Language family possibly derived from Nostratic originally spoken from Iran to India. The best-known contemporary Dravidian languages are Tamil and Telegu which still flourish in southern India. The extinct language Elamite spoken in eastern Mesopotamia may be a branch of Dravidian.
Early Helladic A ceramic period, the name is applied to mainland Greece from 3300 to 2000 BCE.
Early Minoan A ceramic period, the name is applied to Crete in the Early Bronze Age 3300–2000 BCE.



GLOSSARY 701
East Cushitic Branch of Afroasiatic spoken in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. Its best-known language is Somali.
Ebla An ancient Syrian city first excavated in the 1970s. Around 2500 BCE it was the center of a major kingdom with extensive trading relations from Iran and Mesopotamia to Syro-Palestine and possibly Anatolia.
Eblaite The language of Ebla, this distinct Semitic language can usefully be seen as an indirect predecessor to Canaanite.
Egyptian In this book, this is not used to refer to modern Egyptian Arabic but to the language of Ancient Egypt, an independent branch of Afroasiatic. It has been subdivided into a number of phases. The first two are Old Egyptian spoken in the Old Kingdom circa 3400–2400 BCE and Middle Egyptian was the language of the Middle Kingdom 22001750 BCE. It remained the official written language for the next 1500 years. When “Egyptian” is not qualified it refers to this. Late Egyptian was spoken in Upper Egypt in the first half of the Second Millennium, before it became the national speech in the New Kingdom, 1570–1200 BCE. It was not written until the end of this period. For the later stages of the language, see Demotic and Coptic.
Elam Ancient civilization in eastern Mesopotamia and southern Iran from the Fourth Millennium to around 300 BCE.
Elamite Language of Elam. Some scholars link it to Dravidian; others to Munda in India and the Mon-Khmer languages of southeast Asia.
Ethiopia Name given by Greeks to places inhabited by peoples darker than themselves, thus much of Africa and Elam. From the fourth century CE it began to be limited to the north of the present Ethiopia.
Ethiopic Name of the very varied Semitic languages spoken in mod
ern Ethiopia and Eritrea. These include Geœez, the ancient language of the Ethiopian Christian Church; Amharic, the national language of Ethiopia; Tigrinia, spoken in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea; and the Gurage languages of the south. Some retain archaic Proto-Semitic forms.



702 BLACK ATHENA
Etruscan Civilization in ancient central Italy. Greek and Roman writers generally maintained that the Etruscans came from Lydia in northwestern Anatolia. The Etruscan language, which is not well understood, could well be Anatolian. A very closely related language and script has been found on an inscription on Lemnos off the Turkish coast. Etruscan civilization was heavily influenced by Phoenician and Greek cultures from the ninth to the sixth centuries BCE. It was, in turn, a major element in the formation of Roman culture.
Euroasiatic Hypothetical hyper-family, including Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic, Korean, Japanese, Ainu, Tungus, Yukagir and Inuit. It is thought to be a branch of Nostratic.
Europe One of the three continents visualized by Greek geographers.
It derived its name from some of the West Semitic root œereb (sunset or west). As a collection of complex promontories on the edge of the Euroasiatic landmass, it does not fit the normal definition of a continent.
Geœez Most anciently attested Ethiopic Semitic language, it is still used today in church liturgy.
Genetic A genetic relationship between languages is one in which they are supposed to come from a single ancestor. For example, French, Spanish and Romanian have a genetic relationship because, for all their differences, they all derive from the “Vulgar” Latin spoken in the Roman Army. English does not come from this language group, but it is genetically related to these languages at a deeper level because they are all descendents of Proto-Indo-European (PIE).
Georgian People who have inhabited the central Caucasus since the earliest times. The Georgian language belongs to the Kartvelian language family.
Hadza A hunter-gatherer people living in Tanzania. Scholars dispute whether their language is an outlying branch of Khoisan or a linguistic isolate.
Hatti Ancient name for central Anatolia.



GLOSSARY 703
Hattic A non–Indo-Hittite language spoken in Hatti.
Hausa Westernmost and most widely spoken Chadic language, it is dominant in northern Nigeria.
Hebrew Canaanite dialect spoken in the kingdoms of Israel, Judah and Moab in the first half of the First Millennium BCE. For religious reasons it is often described as a distinct language. Modern Hebrew stems from a nineteenth-century revival of the language that had largely been restricted to religious use for two millennia.
Hellenic Greek or Greek speaking, but particularly associated with Thessaly in northern Greece. Since the late eighteenth century CE the term has gained many associations of nobility and northern Aryan “blood.”
Hellenistic The pejorative name given to the mixed Hellenic and “Oriental” culture found around the eastern Mediterranean after the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BCE until the incorporation of the region into the Roman Empire in the first century
BCE.
Hieratic Egyptian cursive script based on the same principles as hieroglyphics used for writing on papyrus.
Hittite Empire in central Anatolia during the Second Millennium BCE. Its Anatolian language was first written in cuneiform and later in its own hieroglyphic system.
Hurrian A people living in Syria and eastern Anatolia in the Third and Second Millennia BCE. Their language was related to that of the later kingdom of Urartu and appears to belong to the Northeast Caucasian linguistic family, now surviving in Chechen and Inguish.
Hyksos Invaders from the northeast who dominated much of Egypt between 1725 and 1575 BCE. Most Hyksos appear to have spoken a West Semitic language, but they also seem to have included Hurrian and even Indo-Aryan speakers.



704 BLACK ATHENA
Indo-Aryan Branch of Indo-European spoken for many millennia in Iran and most of northern India.
Indo-European A subset of Indo-Hittite, it includes nearly all European languages and the Indo-Aryan and Tocharian language families. Although Phrygian and Armenian were situated in Anatolia, they are Indo-European languages and do not belong to the Anatolian branch of Indo-Hittite.
Indo-Hittite A language family that contains both Anatolian and IndoEuropean branches. It is sometimes seen as a branch of Euroasiatic and ultimately of Nostratic.
Inflected languages Languages such as Greek, Latin and German that rely to a great extent on inflection. Word shapes, or morphology, change, rather than syntax or word order, to convey meaning.
Interdentals Consonants formed by putting the tongue between the teeth as in /th/.
Ionians Central Greek tribal grouping that survived the northern conquests. Some Ionians migrated to the west coast of Anatolia.
Iron Age Period after the Bronze Age in which most tools and weapons were made of iron. In Greece, the term tends to be restricted to the first few centuries following the shift as later periods are given names from ceramic styles or written history.
Isolating languages Languages such as Hebrew, Chinese or English which have little or no inflection but rely heavily on syntax or order of words.
Isolationism The belief that cultures cannot be fundamentally affected by others. The opposite of diffusionism.
Kartvelian A Caucasian language family, the best-known example is Georgian. It is possibly an ancient branch of Nostratic.



GLOSSARY 705
Khoisan African language family spoken by hunter-gatherers in southern Africa but with possible distant outliers, Hadza and Sandawe, in Tanzania.
Labials Consonants formed with the lips such as /b/and /p/.
Labiovelars Velars completed with a rounding of the lips as in the English /qu/.
Laryngeals Sounds made with the larynx or throat as a whole. More precisely, they can be divided into velar fricatives /h°/ and /g;/,
pharyngeals /h≥/ and /œ/ and laryngeals in the narrow sense />/ and /h/. All of these existed in Ancient Semitic and except for /g;/ in Egyptian. One or two survived in Anatolian languages, but all, with the very occasional exception of /h/, have disappeared from Indo-European languages.
Late Helladic or Mycenaean Ceramic period in mainland Greece circa 1675–1100 BCE.
Late Minoan circa 1675–1450 BCE. This period ended when the island became dominated by mainland Greeks or Mycenaeans.
Lemnos An island in the northeastern Aegean where a non–IndoEuropean language related to Etruscan seems to have been spoken into Classical times.
Levant A term used since the Middle Ages for the East in general and Syro-Palestine in particular.
Linear A A syllabary with determinatives used on Crete and elsewhere in the Second Millennium BCE, before the establishment of Greek on the island. It seems to have survived in eastern Crete into Classical, if not Hellenistic, times.
Linear B A syllabary with determinatives derived from a prototype of Linear A, used for writing Greek. It is attested from the seventeenth century BCE but may have originated earlier.



706 BLACK ATHENA
Liquids Consonants, such as /l/ and /r/, that flow.
Loan A word in which both the meaning and the sound have been adopted from a word in another language. For example, “kedgeree” from the Hindi khichri “dish made with rice, butter, onions and other condiments” or “just” from the French juste. The impermanence suggested by linguistic use of the words “loan” and “borrowing” is misleading. It merely indicates the distaste among early nineteenth-century linguists for what they saw as the sullying of a pure autochthnous language.
Lycia Ancient region in southern Anatolia. The extinct Lycian language was an indirect descendent of Hittite. Alphabetic inscriptions in Lycian date from the fifth century BCE.
Lydia Ancient region in northwestern Anatolia. The Lydian language belonged to the Anatolian family. Most ancient traditions maintained that the Etruscans came from Lydia. Alphabetic inscriptions in Lydian date from the fifth century BCE.
Mesopotamia Land between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates, more or less corresponding to the modern Iraq.
Metathesis Alternation or switching of consonantal or vocalic position in language. An example of this can be heard in the alternation “ask” and “aks.”
Middle Helladic Ceramic period in mainland Greece from circa 20001675 BCE.
