Foreword
Disease isn't complicated it's really very easy and the application of good sense techniques may defeat any disease. All microbes and viruses are weak and may be defeated easily with cleaning and nutrition.
Disease is a joke if you recognize what to do and you're willing to do what it takes to heal yourself. And as they state “the truth will set you free”; and that's simply where you can, free. If you require drama and a health system that's more about disease than it is about wellness, simply go to your nearest doctor or hospital solely. If you're seeking vibrant health and a long and fruitful life you've come to the correct place for complimentary therapy.
