Manitou
Manitou (/ˈmænɪtuː/), akin to the Iroquois orenda, is the spiritual and
fundamental life force among Algonquian groups in the Native
American mythology. It is omnipresent and manifests everywhere:
organisms, the environment, events, etc.[1] Aashaa monetoo means
"good spirit", while otshee monetoo means "bad spirit." When the
world was created, the Great Spirit, Aasha Monetoo, gave the land to
the indigenous peoples, the Shawnee in particular.[2]
The term manitou was already in widespread use at the time of early
European contact. In 1585, when Thomas Harriot recorded the first
glossary of an Algonquian language, Roanoke (Pamlico), he included
the word mantóac, meaning "gods" (plural). Similar terms are found
in nearly all of the Algonquian languages.
In some Algonquian traditions, Gitche Manitou refers to a "great
spirit" or supreme being. The term has analogues dating to before
European contact, and the word uses of gitche and manitou
themselves existed prior to contact. After contact, however, Gitche
Manitou was adopted by some Anishinaabe Christian groups, such
as the Ojibwe, to refer to the monotheistic God of Abrahamic
tradition, often due to missionary syncretism.
Algonquian religion acknowledges shamans, or medicine men, who
used manitou to see the future, change the weather, and heal illness.
[3] Ojibwe shamans were primarily healers who used their spiritual
connection to cure patients, since illness was believed to be caused
by magic and spirits.[4] To communicate with spirits and manipulate
manitou, a shaman would enter a trance, induced by singing,
dancing, drum beats, or the use of hallucinogens. Non-shamans
could also interact with spirits by embarking upon a "vision quest,"



by means of prayer, fasting, hallucinogens, and/or removing
themselves from the society of others. A person who underwent
vision quests would be visited by an "animal, voice, or object," which
would become his (or her) guardian spirit.[5]
In shamanistic tradition, manitous (or manidoog, or manidoowag) are
connected to achieve a desired effect; plant manitous may be
connected for healing, or buffalo manitous for a good hunt.[citation
needed] In the Anishinaabeg tradition, manidoowag are one aspect of
the Great Connection. The Anishinaabeg use the term manidoowish
to speak of small animal manidoowag, and manidoons to speak of
insect manidoowag. Both manidoowish and manidoons mean "little
spirit."[6]
Manitou has made its way into the names of several places in North
America. The name of Lake Manitoba (for which the Canadian
province of Manitoba is named) derives from the area called
manitou-wapow, or "strait of the Manitou" in Cree or Ojibwe,
referring to the strange sound of waves crashing against rocks near
the Narrows of the lake.[7] Manitoba is also home to Whiteshell
Provincial Parkʼs petroforms, symbols made from rocks, which serve
as reminders of the instructions given to the Anishinaabe by the
Creator. The Anishinaabe Midewiwin, or Grand Medicine Society,
considers the area containing the petroforms to be Manito Ahbee,
the place where God sits. It is the site where the original Anishinaabe
was lowered from the sky to the ground by the Creator.
Manitoulin Island, called mnidoo mnis, or "island of the Great Spirit,"
by the Odawa, is very important to the Ojibwe, or Anishinaabe,
because of its many sacred sites and sounding rocks. Native peoples
continue to dwell on the island, which is host to several reserves.[8]
The Fox Indians, or Meskwaki, believed that the manitou dwelt in the



stones of the sweat lodge. When the lodge stove was lit and water
was sprinkled on the stones, manitou left those stones in the steam
from the evaporating water and entered the body of the person in
the lodge. Manitou then migrated throughout the personʼs body,
driving out everything that inflicted pain. Before the manitou
returned to the stone, it imparted some of its nature to the body,
which, according to the Fox Indians, was why one felt so well after
having been in the sweat lodge.[9]
In Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, the Manitou Islands and
the water body between them and the mainland, the Maintou
Passage; are named for Manitou.
