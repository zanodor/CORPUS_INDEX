FOREWORD
It is an honor and 3 pleasure ro write this foreword to the work of one of the most dedicated and erudite scholars of our time. Throughom the years, Dr. Raphael Parai has contribut<.-d an imprt!SSivc body of work chat is trc3Sun.-d. by both serious researchers and the general population. He h:tS brought together religious litc:r:uurc, history. archaeology, mythology, and folklore to arrive: at 31l exciting new undcrst:lOding of material that h3d onCe: been scancrcd :md often misunderstood. With the initial publicarion of 71le Hlbrtw Goddess, Dr. P:lt:li opcn<..-d up se"eral important areas of research and consider:ltion. Firsr published in 1967. this seminal book discerned [he p:mcrns in tht' evidence of ancient GOOdcss figures in preIsraelite Canaan, dcscrilx-d. the continued existence of these figures among the Hebrew f'l."Oplc in the: biblical period and explained how they had afterwards tx-en woven into Judaic thoughl and practicc. Most important, Dr. Pat;}i created;} well-organized on:rall structure in which the pertinent evidence could be viewed and bener undcrs[(xxi. Dr. rami's discussion of this subject was elaborated upon with a wealth of specific writings and quotations that pointed towards nor only a female aspect of God, but to the specific actions and images of a Goddess figure within Judaism. We initially read of the major Goddess figures in Canaan,

such as Asherah, ,-\oath. and Astart<-. who Were worshiped Ixfore and during th~ Biblical period. Followll1g tht-s<.' historical threads, Dr. Patai then examined divine fem:lk imagery in Talmudic, Kabbalistic, and other Hebrew literarun: that exisn:d at a time when tht· general perception of the Hebrew God was solely as mak. GatlH:ring togetht-r a multitude of :.mall pieces of evidenct: gleaned from nunll'rous texts, he \\~ able to draw the many miniscule pans into a meaningful whole 3:., with the skill of the finest of teacher.;, and a \'ision that is brood and encompassing, he allowcd us to watch 3:. he carefully fit each one of the pi<:ces of the jigsaw pU7..zle into pbce, t'\'clltually cnabling us ro see the entire picture. In this updatl~d edition of 'I7Je Hebrew Godtkss, Dr. Patai has included "aluable additional marerials rhat furthcr flesh Out mat o ri&>inal stnlcnlre. With keen insight and anlcubte commentary. ht' helps us to comprehcnd the n~\\" matt'rials as well as [he subtle, ongoing discourse conceming polytheistic clements within a rehgious Ixlief system based upon monotheism. In the original edition, Dr. Pat.li presented a great deal of inlonnation about various dj,;ne fem:tk inugcs \\;thin Hebr~w littT3.rurc. such as HoIdmm { IVisMmJ, the Sh~khina, the Marronit, and th~ Bride and Queen Sabbath . He anlasscd an impressi\'e body of material that gave clear portrayals of each of these images. BlIt in the namre of the tnH.' scholar, the publication of the original Hebrnl' (rlJdtiffl did not call a halt to hi, rescareh. -111e image of the Shekhina drt'w him further HUO tht' srudy of -.omt' of the mo~t fascinating. material on this subjt.""Ct, the role of the Shckhina in Jud;u!>m O\'er the last few cenruries, His original reconstruction of an o\eraU narra[l"';: of the Sbckhina, alongside his documentation and analysi!> of the :.truggle to explain her role in a Jllonotheisric worship. provide:. witness to the nature of an alive and tht'Ological debate that has seldom bc.-cn achicycd dSt'where. That ancient religious Ixliefs re\'eal the worship of major deitics that arc female. and that these divine female figures, seemingly suppressed and forgonen, yet sceped into the Bible. the Talmud, the Kabbala, and other Hebrew literature, has recently gamercd a great deal of anention and interest, more than would nomlally be expectt'd of such :m academic subjel1: . Much of this interest has been the result of the rise o f the feminist mo\"(ment O\'(:r the last twO decades. The popular explOSIon of the femmist mo\"cnll."nt in late 1968, and irs rapid grov,'th over the next few years, raiS<.-d many questions abour the starus and roles of women III our sociery.

the Impact of various rdigions in fonnubting women's status. Over these bst m'o decades teminists have been observing the various (:xistenr religious systems from :l femmist point of view, but from diverse positIons in society and thus di\'erse perspectives. Many have tx'cn examining a specific religion from the perspective of a member of that religion. They don't wallt to throw the baby our with the bath water. Revision and rcfoml ha\'e resulted. women ha\'e become ordained as Episcopalian priests. Jewish rabbis. and ministers in many Protestant dt.-nominations. Many Catholic nun~ have tx:cn trying to change Church rulings on women to enable them to be ordained as priests. Laurgies and prayer lxx>k.s of nearly all Western fuiths have been quc:stiom.:·d and many of them changed to wording that includl~ both female and male in referencQ to di\'inity as well ~ to the congrcganon. When I fi~t began my book WhIm God Was a Woman in 1969, my own intention was simply to make people aware of the ancient worship of GOO as female-as Gexidcss. Creator of Hea\'en and Eanh, e.g. the Goddess ~ammu in Sumer-to challenge the idea that it was the narural o r tilt' divine plan for men to rule O\'('r women as stated in Gen. 3: 16. It was important to me to show that Goddess worship h:ld exiSted long befor" ehe writing of the Hebrew Scripture [the Old Testament], which is held as sacred b\' both Jews and Chrisri:lIlS.3nd that Goddess re\'erence had aff(.'Ct(-d
the stan~s of women in m:lny poslti\'(: ways. Since the publication of WIJl'7l God Was a Woman in 1976. the mterest in a contemporary reclamation of Goddess history. as wcll as the contemporary enactment of celebratory God· dess rimals, began to form into what is now mo.~t orren rcferred to as [he women's spirinlality mo\'emenr. l '(xby, thousands of women an.' drawing upon Goddess recl:1mation in all areas of work :md srudy. G<xlde.~s figures and imagery have emerg("(i in womens painting. sculpture. drama, novels, poetry. music. dance. and films. New books. :uticles and academic theses dealing \\~th the rccl:1marion of some sJX'cific aspect of Godd~ history arc continllall~' being ",rinen and publishI.-d. Thc teaching of histo')'. J.n hiseo,)', sociolob'y. psychology, philosophr, anthropology. th('Ology. and. of course women'~ studies, has been affected by this ever growing body of infomla· flon about ancicnt Goddess \\'or:.hip, And women's group:; all across the U.S. as well as in Canada. Europe. and other areas have been meeting ro create and enact Goddess rituals at the times of the solstices. equinoxes, new or full moons, and at other times of celebration or life passage. Looking back, I reali;r..c that had I known of Dr. Patai's "DJ( HebreR' Goddess during the years of my o\\'n research for WIJl'7l God Was tl lVom/lll it would ha\'e sa\"Cd me a great deal of time and' effort. Bur it was not until 1978. when I was finishing my second book.Ancimt A1irrors oflVomalll.lOOli.



16 Foreword
that I discovered it. The Avon/ Discus pa~rbad:. edition of The H ebrew Goddess had come out In August of th:u ye:lr. At the time of my first reading of 17" Hebrew Goddess I was deeply impressed not onty by the dedicated and painstakingly detailed research Dr. Patai h:ld done mmy ~'e:lrs before, knowing from my own work what this entails, bur also by his courage in presenting his thesis on the continuation ofGcx:l.dcs.s r{'\"(Tence within Judaism. I found rhe lxJok to be a treasure of fine scholarship as weU as an inspiring cxmlple ofthe inrcgriry of stating what others may ha\'e preferred not to discuss or cven !>CC. I did notice that Dr. Patai had not considered what rccbroaDon of the Goddess might me:ln to and for women. In his chapter on the Matronit, he had suggested that the existence of a Gcx:l.dcss image may have occurred as a somewhat natural response to a basic need and perception of womanhood by "the male of the species." Yct these past few ye:lrs have shown us that it h;>.s been primarily women who have wmted and needed to image deifY as female. I cmnot say that men have not also become interested in the rect.~nr Goddess recl:lJll:ltion, especially where interest in the Goddess is aligned with the sanctity of nature and the Goddess thus becomes m ('cological symbol. But judging from the stanling numbers of women currendy involved in the large md rapidly expanding women's spirinl:llity movement, it is primarily women who h:l\'c responded to revi\'ing the Gcx:l.dess and arc mainly responsible for spre:tding the word, incorporating this reebm:ltion into so m:lny diversc :tre:ts ofculmre and spirimal cdebr:ltion t()(i:ly. This in rum Ie:td.. me [0 the mention of a prediction made by Dr, Pat:ti in 1967-before the fXlpular emergence of the women's movement. At the end of his introduction. Dr. l'atai asked, " is the Hebrew Gcx:l.dess dc:td, or docs she merely slumber, soon to awaken ... ?" He went on to s:ty that "should she manage to revive. we can eXJXct this to take pbn: only in the Land of Israel:' We must remember that this was wriITen sc\Tr:t1 years before the stan of the feminist movement and ('ven more vears before rill' risc of the women's spirimalit)' movcmenr. And, as the wise among us understand, C\'ems we expect to happen do frequendy occur, but often in the least expected ways. So it imeresting to note, some 22 years after Dr. Pami's collt('"Tnpl:ttiYC question, mat the HcbR"'\v Goddess has indeed R"\ivoo but in perhaps a most unexpected manner. This rcvival has resulted directly from the women's spiritu:tliry movement, which itself grew from within the ft.·minist movement, in the United States. ~onctheless, much of the revi\':ll of the Hebrew Goddess h:ts been based upon infonn:ttion in Dr. Patai'~ writings. Along with the m:tny Goddess figures in which contemporary women h:tVt' shown :t sJ'L"Cial interest, figures such as the Sumeri:tll (nann:t, the

an:llogil..'S herc abom single parcl1I homes or ("motionally dis[an~ fathers. othcr than to mention that in this son of mythic considcr:,nion they do come to mind. Despite these differences, the wealth of infonnation and the ery~tal clear presentation and analysIs of the evidence in The Hebrew Goddess demand that It be read by anyone interested in religious history. thl'Ology or the reclamation of the Goddess today. Dr. Parai has gi\'en us a classic work on the subject of the continual emergence of dinne female figur(.'S within Judaism. It offers an insight into Judaism that has long been ignored. Bur e\'cn beyond Judaic Studies. it pro\'ides somc \'cry \'3.Iuable streams of thought that may be useful for thc study of religion in general. Dunng my own years of research, I ha\'c found an am3l'.ing di\'ersity ofpcrccption. narrative, imagery. and symbolism of di\'inity. both in ancient cultures and in those that still sun'i\'c. This diversity raises questions about why the di\'ine or the sacred is perceived as it is-in specific forms at specific times and places. In TIle Hebrew Goddro. which covers such a vast chronological spectrum and such a broad geography, Dr. Parai succeeds nor only in prcscming a body of work on a Goddess figure within Judaism but, perhaps c\'(:n more importantly. allows us to gain some insight into the \'cry proc~ of debatc. (ransfomlation, and continual de\'elopment of many. if nor all religious images and beliefs. I first found 17u Hebrn!'

Moreover, in very early &nrasy [ife the frustrated nursling wants to d(...."Our the mother's breast, imagines that he acrually is destroying the mother, and. projecting his own hostility upon her. fears that she will devour him-hence the bloodthirsty character shart:d by the ancit:nt Ncar Eastern virginal and wanton love goddesses. Jungian analytical psychology considers the Great Goddess as :1 primordial image or archetype in the sense of an inward image at work in the human psyche and ~moolically expressed in her figures as represented in the myths and anisric crearions of mankind. The workings of the goddess· archetype can be traced in rires, myths, and symbols throughout history, as well as in the drean)S, fantaSies, and creati\'t: works of both the sound and the sick of our own day. The archetypal Feminine, dcsignat(.-d only relatively late in the history of mankind as the Great l\lother, was worshiped and portrayed thousands of years lxfore the appearance of the tenn. A wealth of symbol ic im:tgcs surrounded her, and she herself appeared in numerous manifestations. as goddesses and fairies, she-demons and nymphs. some' times friendly. sometimes hostile. An c:sscntial fc:.uurc of the primordial goddess archetype is m:tt it combines positive and negative :truibutcs.
This union of opposites in the primordial arch(:rypcs. its anlbi\,a· lence, is characteristic of the original situation of the unconscious. which consciousness has not yet disscctt:d into its antithe5'."S. Earlv

Funher srudy. umkrt:lkm in me present volume, indic:ltcs {h:lt there were among the Biblical Hebrl'ws other religious trends, powerful in their :mraction for rhe common people and their leaders alike. in which the worship of goddesses pi:tyed as impor[:lm:l role :lS it did anywhere clse on comparable stages of religious den:lopment, It will also be artempted to show that the female deitic:. of tht' early. monarchic pcriocl did nor subsequently disappear but underwent transfom1Jrions and succeeded in their changed fomu to retain much of their old sway O\'lT religious SI.:ntinll"llts. How these diRcfl,u religious m:nds could c<x:xist requires some explanation. In conrrast to the Roman Catholic faith with its single lxxfy, the Church. Judaism has never developed a monolithic structure which could superimpose its authority upon all Jewish communities in rhe many i:tnds of their diaspora. Local \'ariations exist, to be sure, between one Catholic dIOcese and another, as well as between folk belief and pr:lcticc, on rhe one hand. and the official teachings and ritl'S of the Church. on the other. Yer there is only one Catholic faith. one doctrine and one practice. which UllItes bclie\'ers throughout the world. Doctrines :lnd rites m:ly change. as thl'Y did in rhe course of cenruries; bur when tht"y do. it is OCC:lllSC the Church. as embodied in the PofX-' :lnd the ROIll:ln Curi:l. dcridC"s on a modific:ltion and m:lkl'S it. from that rime on. the mk' equally mandaTOry upon the entire f:lr-Rung body of the Church. S"O such unity exists in Jud:lism. nor has it ever niSh.-d, with the possible exception of a brief periocl when the Great Sanhedrin exercised central :lllthoriry in Jcnlsalcm. Prior to that time and after it ro this d:ly. Jewish dOCtrine :lnd practice. :llthough derived from one ultimate sourcc, the Bible. diftered from place to pi:tcc. because. lacking a c(X)rdinating and sal1cti~'ing ccnrral authority. their precise fonnulation was left to local religious lead· ership. For example. European ]cws, in obedience to a cenain medieval r:lbbinic:ll authority, accepted the religious ban on marrying twO or more wivcs, while thcir brethren in the Middle East continued to consider plural marriages legal and to practice polygamy to the present time. Diflercnces in doctrine among Christians k-d to schism. Among Jews. they led to heterodox groupings without secession. lxc:luSC there was no organized religious body from which to SCCl-dC or which might h:lve cut off the offending limb, There was, to be sure, dis.appro\'aJ of the views and conduct of groups other than one's own, there were even :lrgunlellts and conflicts; but however erronl"OUS the \\·:l.Ys of others appc:m:d.. such errors were nevcr considered serious enough to warrant a fonnal bre:lk.

ious leaders cn:r used the we:lpon of the fJrTfm Cb:ln") 3~inst :lny J("Wi:.h group, howcv(,:r gre:lt thc dis:lpprm-a.1 provoked. A e3SC in point is the situation that dC\'eloped 111 the 18th and 19th cenruries when the Je\\'s of E3.Stem Europe lx:came sharply dl\'ided into Hasidim (roughly, Mystics) alld Atitnagdim (OPFKlllCI1U). Thc antagonism bcn\'l'Cn the twO groups increased to such a degree that intennarr1age bennxn thcm was completely out of the question. Yet, at no point during thc gre:lt struggle, did any H3Sidic or Mimagdic leader go so far as to C:lsr a doubt upon the Judaism ohhe opposing group. Similar rurcations haw occurred repeatedly III Judaism, belore and ~ince, but without ncr splining Jews into m ·al. discrete groups. "Il,e rele\'ance of theM: observations [0 the subjl'ct of the prc:.em study is as follows. Whatever fonnulation was given [0 the Jewish laith by any locli religiOUS leadership, simult:tlll"Ously aJld side by side with it existed di\'ergem t'3.ith-variams within the br03d 3nd flexible overall framework of Judaism. Consider th(" siruatio n in Palestine in the d3ys of the great Hebrew proph("fs. Thl-re was hhwism, prc:aehed by the prophets; there was all offici:al cult. org:lni7.ed by the court :and he3ded by the king; there were local vari.:mts. combining elementS from thl'$C tWO as well as from other sources. practicl'd by the Simple country folk; and there were: seers such as the Rechabitcs who constlnlted :til early example of what religious histori:tllS call primiti\'ists. Yet all these trends were part of the --Hebr('w religion" of the Biblical period. The a\'eragc Ia~man, whether Jew or Gentile, still believes that the official Hebrew religion was a Strict monotheism beginning with God's revelation of Him!>Clf to Abraham. Scholars date the origin of Hebrew monotheism a few cenruries later, during the days of the great prophets. As we shall sec, ('\'cn this qualified stau:mem must be modified somewhat in view of certain doctrines. which sucn:edcd in being admitted into rhe literary depositories of the official religion during Talmudic times, and in \;ew of the Kabbalistic adumbration of a plurality of persons in the deity. Let us here stress the fact that in addition to "official" Jlldaism - that crystalli7..:l.rion of rhe religion which represented the consensus of most of the religious Icadl-rs of a cerr-ain time and place - Judaism has always compriSt.-d heterodox \'ariants as well. Morcover, since there was no hard-and -fast dividing line bc:n\'een official and non-official versions of the faith, there was constant interaction bcnyeen the two. The feminine numina discu.~scd in this book must. therefore, be considered part ofthe Hebrew-Jewish religion, whether they were admitted into the "official" fannulation of the (.lid1 or accepted only by the simple JX'Oplc. against whose beliefs and practices the exponents of the fonner n("ver ceased to thunder.



28 The Hebrew Goddess
31The Masculine Godhead
Let us now proceed to !<x>k at the person of the d,.-iry as He appeared, firs t of aI!, in the Biblical and Talmudic writings. 10 begin with, let us restate that the legitimate Jewish faith. beginning with the earliest fomllilations of its belief-system by the great Hebrew prophets. down to its \'arious present-day versions (e.g.• those of Onhodox. Conservati\'c, and Refoml Judaism in the United States), has always been built upon thc axiom ofOne God. This credo had its complementary corollary in the denial of the vcry possibility of other gods. As for God. He is nOt merely the One and Only God. but also etemaL omnipotent. onmipresenr, omniscient, aphysical (and therefore invisible). inscrut3ble, and incomprehensible. as well as just, good, compassionate. merciful, and ocnevolent. Since, being pure spirit, he is without body, he possesses no physical anributes and hence no sexual traits. To say that God is either male or female is therefore compk-rdy impossible from the viewpoint of traditional Judaism. As Maimonides, the greatest medieval Jewish philosopher, pur it, "God is not a body, nor can bodily arrribures be ascribed to him, and He has no likeness aT alL'" Yet one factor, a linguistic one, defied all theological repugnance to the attribution of bodily qualities to God. It is in the nature of the Hebrew bnguage that every nOlln has either the masculine or the feminine gender (except a n:ry few which can takt' either). The n\'o Biblical nanles of God, Yahu'ch (pronounced. Out of reverence for its great holiness. as WAdonai" and usually translated as "'the Lord") and Ewhim (or briefly El, translated as "God"'). arc masculine. \-Vhell a pronoun is uscd to refer ro God, it is the masculine "He"; when a verb describes that H,' did something or when an adjecrin' qualified Him, they appear in the masculine fonn (in Hebrew there arc male and female forms for verbs and adjectives). Thus. every verbal statement about God conveyed the idea that He was masculine. Most people,of course, never stopped to think about this. bur evcry Hebrew-speaking individual from early childhood was imbued with the idea that God was a masculine deity. No subsequent teaching about the aphysical. incomprehensible. or transcendental nature of the deity could eradicate this early mental image of the masculine G o d . ' , In fact, during Biblical and Talmudic times, no effortS were made to counteract the popular image of a masculine God, On the contrary, while the Bible stresses that man cannot see God and survive, and the Talmud contains the a.xiom that "God sees bur cannot be seen." both of these great source-books of Judaism contain innumerable references to God which reinforce belief in His masculinity. Th,' Biblical prophets. psalmists, mor·



Introduction 29
aiiSlS, and hisrori:ms, as well as the sages, scribes, theologians, rabbis, and teachers of the Talmudic period, const:mtly usc unmitigat("d anthropomor· phisms in referring [0 God. He is a "Man of War,'" a " H ero;" "Lord of Hosts." ~King," ~ Mastcr of the Uni\'erse," and "Our Father in Hea\'en,'" [0 mention only a few expressions. Needlcs~ to say, these apIX'lIations all carry a pronouncedly masculine connotation, :md, togc.-ther with the words of rhe prayer, -We are YOUf sons, and You arc Ollr Father," or "Haw mercy upon us as a father has on his sons!" indelibly impressed all Jews nOt only with the Kingship and Farherhocx.i but also WIth the Manhood of God. Theologians will point out [hat nonc ofthcsc expressions are indlcati\'c of an actual belicfin.let 310n(" 3 dQctrill(: of, the masculinity ofGod. Human imaginatio n, thl.]' will argue, needs symbols to fastcn on. The fatherhood of God (which connotes His masculinity) is merely such a symbol. We do not mc:lO, whcn wc pra~' to Our Father in Hcaven. that He actually is our male progenitor, but that we fed that we are dependent on Him. as we were on our father in childhood. We certainl~' ha\'e no quarrel with this argument. The God of Judaism is undoubtedly a father-symbol and fadler· image, possibly the greatest such symbol and image conceived by man. Nor can there be any doubts as to the greatness of the ps:.'chological oc-cd answered by this image. This, togcther with the great moral imperatives, was the uniquc contribution of prophetic Judaism to mankind.
Qxuparative rdigion, howC\'er, teaches us that there is in man an I.:qually great. or possibly even gre:lter. need for yet allOther symbol: that of the divine woman who appears in many different forms throughout the world. yet remains basically the S3me everywhere. Most familiar to us in the West· ern world is the figure of Mary, who rose to such prominence in Christi· anity. and especially in Catholicism. Did Judaism, the mother-religion of Christianity, fa.il to fulfill this need? Is it conccivable that the bum3n craving for a divine mother did not manifest itself 3t all in Juda.ism? It is true, of course. that official Judaism. to a gre3ter extem than Chris· tianity, let alone the ancient N e3r Eastern religions, stressed the moral and intelk-qual aspects of religion, to the relative neglect of its affective and emOtioll:!.1 side. TIle prophetic demand for justice 3nd mercy and the knowl·
edge of God as the core of religion, rather than ritual obser....ance, points in this direction. By the beginning of the Talmudic period, Judaism was characterized by an emphasis on the ~rudy of the Law as the essence of rdig-ion, as :!.gainst mere belief expressed in tr.1ditional and cmotion·13dcd im3ges. It is characteristic of this de\'elopment, as well as of [he incipienr reaction to it. that as ag:tinst thc thousands of new religious laws contained in the vast compendium of the Talmud, one finds in it only one single significant addition to the realm of religious faith: rhe looselr sketched.

According to another tradition, the idolatrous instinct. or "the G::nius of Idola[~'." as the name can be equally translated. was O\'Crcome only as late a!> the days of Nehemiah. that is, in 445 R.C.E, when the Leyites among the Judacans "cried with :l loud \'oice untO the Lord their God."o Their request. a Talmudic mvth recounts. was:

In a more general sense, tOO, there can be no doubt that down to the vcry end of the Hebrew monarchy the worship of old Canaanite gods was an integral p3rt of the religion of the Hebrews. As we shall SI.'C in the first twO chapters, the worship of goddesses plaYI.-d a much more important role in this popular religion than that of gods. The re3.';On is nOT far to seck. The image of Yahweh, in the eyes of me conmlOn people. did not differ grl.'3dy from mat of Baal or the other Canaanite male gods. Often it would ha\"C been difficult to detemline whether a certain cult was legitimately Yah\\;stic, heretically Yah\\istic, or unequivocally pagan. The worship of Y:lhweh thus easily merged into. compkmentl.'d. or supplanted that of the Cma3Jlite male gods. But Yahwism lacked the female touch which was such :l.n Important ~n ofCana3Jlite religious life. Nothing it couJd offer rcpbced the Canaanite goddcsscs. Therefore. the prophetic denunciations of thcsc idols had link dfc:a. The devotees of the goddesses could not be swayed to give them up and to concentrate instead exclusively all the wOf(;hip of a m31e god.

Introduction 33
The Matronit. meanwhile:, continued to be closely concerned with her children. Like: a true goddess, she played the role: of spouse as well as mother to her people:. She also assumed the form of a di,me queen and bride, who joined them every Friday at dusk to bring them joy and happiness on the sacred Sabbath. To this day, in every Jewish temple or synagogue she is welcomed in the Friday evening prayers with the words "Come, 0 bride!" although the old greeting has long been emptied of all mystical meaning and is regarded as a mere poetic expression of uncertain significance. Is the Hebrew goddess dead, or docs she merely slumber, soon [Q awaken rejuvenated b~' her rest and fl-cl::tim the heans of her sons and Im'ers? No one can say. Bur should she manage to revive, we can expect this to take pl::tce only in the Land of Israel. It was there that she first clasped to her bosom the wild Hebrew warriors who irrupted from the dcscn. It 'vas there that most of her life-history, including her alllning metamorphoses, took place. And it was there-less than four hundred years ago!-that her Rachel and Leah forms revealed to the pious and the lc3rned the divine meaning of earthly Im'e, the last of her gre3t motheriy-witely acts, 3nd th3t her identity with the ancient Biblical goddess Asher:l.h was recognized 9 in a remarkable flash of inruiti"e insight. It will be rhere, therefore, if at all. that she will re-emerge, in who knows what surprising old-new image. to mediate. as of old. between man and God and to draw tile remming faithocreft sons with new bonds of Im'e to their patiently waiting Father.

THE GODDESS ASHERAH
In embarking now upon :1Il examination of the \';uious fonns In which the fcminmc principle was conceived by the Biblical Hebrews and their successors, the Jews ofrhe Hellenistic, Talmudic, and Kabbalistic peri· ods, we begin, so as to proceed in chronological order, with the Goddess Ashcr:th, who was the earliest tl-maJc deity known to h::tn:: been worshiped bv the Children of Isr3d.
l i The Problem
The beginnings of the period \\'t' :m' dealing with here go back to the time following the 3ITi"al of the Israelite tribes in Canaan. For about Sl\" centuries thereafter, that is ro say. down to the destruction of Jerusalem by Ncbuchadm:zzar in 586 a,c.E.. the Hebrews worshiped A~hnah (and next to her also other, originally Canaanite, gods and goddesses) in most places and rimes. Only intcnnittcntly, although with gradually increasing inrcnsiry and frequency, did the propht·tic dl."mand for me worship of Yah· weh as the one and only god make itself be heard and was it hcedt·d by the people and their leaders. This much is apparent, although the religious history of the period as a whole-in spite of the numerous suldics dcmted

36 The Hebrew Goddess
earl~' Hebrew popular religion. This can be divided into four categories:
I. The evidence of the Blbil:. which, in spite of the e£lons of itS monotheistically oriented authors and/or editors, contains incidental mfomlafion as to the court ritual and popular religion which a few judges and kings and aU the prophets Strove." to suppress, eliminate, and replace by 1l1onothcistic Yahwism. 2. Local archaeological e\'idcnce. admittedly limited. but ncn:rthcleS$ useful and. with the intensive work. going on in ISr:le1. dail~' IIlcrc:lSing in yolumc and variem 3. The considerably more ample data conraincd in Canaanite. Syrian, Mesopotamian. Iranian, Anatolian, and Egyptian archaeology and mythology, with their derailed infonnation about the deities who, according to Biblical evidence., were worshiped by the Hebrews. 4. Liter:lf)' sources of ~{·Biblical Judabm, which flow richly estx'Cially in the first few centuries of rhe Christian era; which, becausc of their less sacred character were not subje.."Cted to the same meticulous scrutiny-as the Holy Book: and in which. therefore, many references and recollections of early Hebrew polytheism were able to pass muster.
This c..i1lU1)e..T.l.tion of the types of source material ocaring on early Hebn.:w popular religion indICates the amount and nature of the infonllation we can expect concerning the female deity whose person, image, and worship foml the subject of the present chapter. We 3re forewamed th3t the data will be neither ample nor explicit, neither exhaustive nor detailed, and, in some c;u,cs at k:lSt, neither conclusive nor Irrefutable. As far as the Biblical books arc conceme..-d, their anri-polytheistic anitudc manife~[s i~elf in, among other things. 3 pronounced rductance to allow :Ul}" ritual detliJ of pagan worship to enter the rcfen'nces they contain to Israd's religious transgressions. Nevertheless, it is from Biblical sourees th3t we know the n:Ul1CS of the three goddc.s.'iCS who were worshiped by [he :U1Cient Hebrou. down to the days of the Babylonian exile: Asherah, Astarte, and the Qu«n of He3\'cn, who was probably identical with Anath. It is with the first of these three thar the prc.:s<.:m chapter deals. Let us begin by re\'icwing what extra-Biblical sources tdl us about Asherah.

She suckled evCJl human erinccs who were exceptionally dCSCJ"\;ng, such as Y.ssib, the son of King Kem.

In carly times they often stood next to altars dedicated to BaaJ;lo larer. a "'sratuc of Asherah'" was set up in the J(.'rusakm Tempk itself.! I The word Asherah in Biblical usage call thus refer
either to the goddess herself o r to her image. ll From a lorory told in the Book of Judges about Gidoon, who Ii\'cd III the 12th cenmry B.C.E.. we kanl that the Asherah worship in those early daylo was a commun:tl or public affair.

~"X6iV:lU:d:r:h(' one most closely resembling Solomon's is that of Tell Tainat in Syria from rht, 9th cennu'Y R.C.E. That temple. like the one of Jerusalem, was <fu'idedjmo thre~tions. a \·estibule.. a nan:, and an inner ~ctuan:.and like it•.E.~!w~ pillars at its emrance.

It is probable that this similarit)-' in structure and furniShings was matched by a :.imilariry of the worship itself: the ditTermce ocm'een Yahweh and other god:. lar not in ritual. but in rhe ideology and morality, which was de\'Cloped in his nan1C by the great Hebrew propb(·ts. The chronicler of Solomon's reign reproaches him for h:a\'ing built plac(':s of worship for many gods. yet he does so in a curiously restrained manner: Solomon's heart, he says, '''was not whole with Yahweh his god." and "'he did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, and went 'lOt ft,l~y after Yah\\'eh as did Da\·id his father:'l" In the passage in question, two exten· uating circumstances are offered in excuse of Solomon's aas: he did what h(~ did because his wi\'cs, to wbom ~he cleaved in 10\'(.';' turned his heart: and all this happened when Solomon was old.l1l Historical considerations, hO\\'e\'er, uwalidate rhesc excuses. firstly. we know that political marriages between a ruler and foreign prinCt:sSt.'S were :111 acceptc.-d means of strengthening alliances or friendly rclations between states. Secondly. the introduction of a foreign princess into a royal household inevitably meant the admission of ncr gods as well. Thirdly, while such marriages may have: taken place any rime during the reign of a king. the most all\bitio~ of Solomon's political marriages, that with rhe daughler of Pharaoh, \\'3.'> t"lltcred into at the very beginning of Solomon'!> reign. :1 It is rea:.onablc to a:.sUIll(· that he married the Sidonian

pnoccssU about the same time that he sct about to carry Out his great building projccrs for whose cx«ution he nceded the friendship and help of the Phoenicians. A Hinite princess at his court-whose prcscnce served
as a li\'ing political bond between Solomon and me nco·Hirrirc states of Syria-was also \'aluablc for him at me same rime, as were daughters orhis
Moobirc, Ammonite and Edomitc \'aSSals. These marriages were in me narurc
of guarmu."CS of security. without which he would have had to keep powerful troup contingents in const:tnt readiness at a time when he needed all me 3v3ibblc manpower in the country for rhe construction of his grandiose religious and royal compounds. It is rhus mon: than probable that all these marriages werc contracted by Solomon soon after his succession, and mu the introduction of tht' respective divinities worshiped by his wives also took place at the same rimeY Among the deities whom Solomon \\'orshipcd was ~the Goddess of
me Sidonians" who. as we have seen. was none other th:lI1 Asher:th. HowC\~iStorian recording this calls hcr ""'Ashrorcth. Goddess of the Sidonians:"14 Also, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonire, an uncompromising Yahwist who flourished towards thl.' end of Solomon's reign and in the
years following it., reproaches the Israelites once with wo~hiping '""Ashtorcth, the Goddess of the Sidonians," and another time with serving Asherah.lS Howeyer, such a confusion of Asherah and Ast:lt"tl.' is not confined to the Biblical authors who cqu:uly detested both of them; it is found. as mentioned aoo..'c., :urt:ady in the Amama Inters wrinen in the 14th century acE. b}, people who should have known bener because they believed in the tWO goddesses and worshiped them. But we ha\'e to keep in mind that in ~'theiSfK cultum.. tb£..prn'31cnt tendenc), onen was to idcnru:.' one god with another., substitute one g(xrfOr another, combine one god with
anothcr3 or c:aJ.Lone g..od~ tfic name of another. as we know from many examples in the Egyptian, Babylonian," Hittite or Canaanite religions. In 3Il¥ ca~o:e.can bc.little doubt that it was the worship o(Asherah, already ROPUJa( amoog.the.HebrC\\·s f~'eraJ g~tio~ which was introduced b,y SoIomonimo.JausaJem as part of the cult of the royal hOllschold, for his Sidonian wife.

On the basis of the :lbove r:lpid survey. one call summarize rhe history of As6crah worship in ISr.lel. The Goddess Ashcnh was worshiped. in Israel
from the davs of the first settlement in C.1naan, the Hebrews h:lving taken
~hc cult of this great mother goddess from tht' Om3anitcs. For public worship, the goddess was represented by C3rvcd wooden images, implanted into the ground, usually nc..'([ to an altar dedicated to the god. Baal, and lOCated on hillrops, under leafy m:es. For private religious use, innumerable small clay figurines of Ashcrah were in circulation. showing the goddess in [~ude. with the characteristic gesture of holding her own breasts in c~hasis of hcr fertility aspect.
During the reign of Ahab. under me influence of b.i.s Sidonian wife Jczcbel. the worship oL\shcrab recei\'(:d add(.-d impetus: a statue of Asherah, probably much morc elaborate and imprt'SSive than the wooden images simple villages could afford. was made and set up in Samaria, making that cit)', Mab's capital. the center of the Asherah cult. At the same time, Bethd in the south and 12m in. the north of the Israelite kingdom remained the CJlters orthc court-apprO\'ed cult of Yahweh, idcmified with me Canaanite deity who manifested himself in the shap<" of a bull-calf and was relaxed to t imer Bull·EI or his son Hadd, the Baal (i.e.• the Lord ) of the Ugariric pantheon. The cult of rhe Asht'rah escaped the popular anti-Baal and pro- Yahweh uprising which, 1eclby the prophet Elijah. took place under Ahab. $everal ~'em later., when all the Baalists were m:lSS:lcrcd and Baal's temple In Samaria destroyed by Jehu. the Asherah of Samaria again escaped unhaoned, and ~ worship survived down to the end of the Israelite monarchy. The Assyrians put :m end to the Kingdom of Israel in 721 or 722 R.C.E.; yet at least one center of Asherah worship and one statue of the goddess Asherah survi\'cd thc n3tional catastrophe by a hundred years. As pan of his great Yahwist refoon, King Joshiah ofJudah. in or after dlC year 621 B.C.E.. purged Beth-d of the remainder of me rdigious buildings and institutions ereCTed there by Jeroboam more than 300 years pre\'iously. The terst one-vcrse notice, in which the Book of Kings reports this,42 states that Joshiah destroyed the altar and tht· high plaee (bamnh ) that Jeroboam had made, "and bumcd Asherah." No word in this notice about the Golden Calf which Jeroboam had set up for worship in Beth-e1 and against which Hosea found it necessary to prophesy as late as the second half of the 8th

Hi::. momcr. ~aamah. was rhe Ammonite wile of Solomon. under whrn.c tutelage Rchoboam must ha\'l: ocen introduced [0 the worship of Mi kom. Rchoboam's favorite wife was Maacah . the daughter of Abshalom« - that is to say. she was his patcmal cousin. M:l.3Cah bore Si:\'cr:ll sons to Rchoboam; hcr eldest. Abijah or Abij:l.m, was his Sther's favorite , whom Rchoboam appoinrc.-d. to be chief o\'er his other sons by his orner wivcs, and made him heir to his throne durin~ his lifetime. In all this one recognizes. of course, Maacah's hand; hcr position rc.maincd equally strong after hcr son Abijam actually succeeded Rchoboam, when she assumed thl' position of CrJ>imh, or quccn-mothcr.4S j\-b.ac:m used hcr mRucncc to introduce the Ashcrah already worshiped in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon, into the Temple itself.... During the shorr reIgn of Abijam (911-908 B_CE.) the image of Ashcr:ah remained in its pl::lce; bur Abijam's succession by As:l (908-867 B.C.E.)4' marked the end of both Ma:lc:lh's dominancc as queen-mother and the worship of her Asherah. Under the influenn' of:l prophet - a cemin .A7..ariah, the son of Odcd-Asa, in the fifteenth year of his reign, instirut(:d the first rcligiou:. refoml in the history of the Judaean kingdom.48 He "'put :l\\':lY the detest· able things [i.e., the appurremnccs of idol worship] out of:lll the bnd of Judah and Benjamin,~ remOH...d the sacred male prostitutes. and all the idols. took a\\ay the strange altar:. and the sun-images, broke down the pillars and hewed down the Ashcr:ahs. and, finally. rcmO\"ed the Asherah made by Maacah. made dust of it and burnt it in the Kidron Valley. at the same rime deposing Maacah herself from her exalted position of queen-mother.·.., One note:. that the serring up of the Asherahs which Asa removed from all O\'er the land of Judah is nowhere mentioned in the Biblical sourccs. This leads to the conclusion that this popular form of Asher:ah worship was a hcritagc from the pre-monarchic period discussed abo\'e. Asa's son and successor, Jehoshaf3t (870-846 Be_E.) , conrinued his father's cleanup work: he removed, we arc told, :111 the Asher:lhs from tht' countryside,SO Although this was already done by ..-\sa, he either did not complete the job or the ..-\sherahs had sprung up again soon after they were rcmO\'cd b~' him. The $("er Jehu. son of Hanani, complimented Jchoshafat for his zeal,sl bur even this viCTory of Yahwism o\"("r Asherism was shorrJived. Som(" ten years after the death of Jchoshafat.

and Northwcst Semitic Litcrarurc .~!>8 One of the most intriguing finds that has come (0 light in the past decade is that o f Kunrillat 'Ajrud in the northeast Sinai. some forry mik"S south of 'A)," al·Qudarrat (equated with Kadcsh-Bamca). where tWO I:lrgc piriJoi (sror:lgc jars) were discrn"ercd. They art' O\'Ct three fcet high. :md o ne of th(-'m carries this inscription (in my rranslation): -Amaryau said to my lord .. . m:ly you be bles.S<.--d by Yahweh and by his Ashcrah. May he bless you and keep yo u, and be with m~' lord." f>II Another inscription from rhe same sire reads : -I h:lVC blessed you by Yahweh shmm and his Ashcrah.- '"tI The meaning of sJnnrn is uncertain; possibly it refers to SI)(mmm, that is. Samaria. The Kunrillat "Ajrud pithqi have been ascribed [0 ca. 800 8 C E.. that is. to the middle period of the di\idcd JUdc:lll-Israditc monarchy. At Khirbct al-Qom.. 3.- site some .nine miles west of Hebron . another inscripoon w;tS found. h reads: ~Uriah the rich has caused if to be wrincn : Blessed be Uriah by Yahweh and by his Asherah; from his enemies he has S<II\~him."" l
These inscriptions show [h:)( in IX'pular religion the Goddess Asherah was associated with Yahweh, probably as his wife, and that "Yahweh and his Ashcrah" were the most IX'pular di\'ine couple. In the light of these finds some Biblical scholars ha\'e suggesTed an tmendarion to a difficult passage in Hosca. In the Massorctic text H osca 14:9 reads (God speaking): ~As for Me, I reslX'nd and look on him [on Ephraim]." In rhe original: am 'a'l;t; R'a'mJJUmm. The text as it stands, docs nOt make good sen.s.c. The foml wa'AJJuYnto, which appears repeatedly in £he a. m. inscriptions, suggests the reading am 'A"ato R'a'AJheralo, that is, "I am his Anath and his Asherah." If so, what God says (through H osea) is, "1 am Ephraim's Anath and Asherah" - I am the one who provides the people with the blessings of fertility. This emendation restores the paralklism bctv.'een v. 9a and 9b. lost in the Massorctic text. The whole passage, then, would have Goo say:
Ephraim, what ha\'c 1 ro do any more with idols? I [Yahweh] am his Anad1 and his Ashcrah, I am like a Ica~' "-,,)'Press-tree From me is thv fruit found : 1
The combined imlX'rt of these recent archaeological finds and the suggested emendation of the passage in Hosea - added to the historical record as it can be gleaned from the Biblical references summarized above-is that me worship of Asherah:1S the consort of Yahweh ("his Asherah"! ) was an inrqy1 clement of religious life in :l.ncicnt Israel prior to the reforms intra-ducM-by-Kiug loshiah in.6.2! -fI,.C E.

Most of the chiefgods of ancient SyriJ, to judge from the Ugaritic sources, had tWO n3J11t'S; occasionally one was a proper namc and the other an epirht't. As we ha\'e scen above, the Lady Asherah of the Sea was also referred to as E\:uh, that is Goddess. Her husb3J1d, properly IlJmed Father Shuncm, was in most C3SCS ~tyled El (i.e., "God~ ), or Bull El. Asherah's son Hadd is almost 3.lways called Baal or Master. The Di" ine Mot is also called Ers Darling Gh:v.ir. Another god is 3Itcm:l.tingly called Prince Yamm (Sea) and Judge i'\ahar ( River), In like fashion . Asherah's daughter .seems to be called either An3th or Astarte ("Ashrorerh ). Two namcs for a deity arc a prosodic requirement for classical Semitic poetry', a favorite device of which is the reduplication of significant Statements without.l repetition ofehe same words. In order to be 3ble to ('xpress the same idca in twO parallel S(-ntenccs, using two setS of s~TIonymous words, the Semitic poet had to have ,n his disposal nvo names for his gods who figure so pro minemly in his mythological poems. The following examples, all raken from [h(' Ugaritic tablets. illu)tratc the point:

21Astarte ill the Bible
In passing now to an examination of the Biblical references to Astarte. let us begin with those which show the dearest correspondence with the extra-Biblical sourees. The citv of'AshtaTtU in the Bashan is referred to several rimes in the Bibk:. as a city of Levite'>, Once it is called Sc'cshterah,18 once 'Ashterah,l<> but usually 'Ashtaroth, in the plural fonn which is frequently employed in Biblical pl:tce namcs, :O 'Ashtaroth was originally the
capit2l city of Og. the legendary giant king of Bashan.21 and of his people the Rcphaim who were sminen b~' Chedorlaomer, H This last memioned detail is contained in an old semi-hiStorical. scmi-mythical accounr wh ich is the only reference to ft:tain the full old name of the city: r.AJburorbQarnaim (i.e" "Astarte of the Two H oms~). -me concept behind this designation is gr::tphicaUy illustrated by SI.....·era! Astarte-figurines found at \'arious archaeological sites in P:Ilcstine :Ind actually showing the goddess with twO homs.13 (Sec P!:Ites 9 and 10.) The original meaning of the name Astarte «Ashtorcth) was "'womb~ or ~hat which issues from the womb,"H Such a meaning is most appropriatc as an appcllati\'e for a goddess of fertility: she is caUed -she of the ....'Omb:· i,c,. the inducer. as well as symbol, of fertility, just as hcr brotherconsort Baal was the inducer and syrnbol of male fenili~·.15 Thus the primary meaning of the names of the di\'inc couple B:Ial and Ast:Irtc was begetter and conccl\·er. man and woman, husband and wife. This being the C:l.Se, the name 'Ashtoreth or Asr:mc must h:l\'c originally been but an epithct of the goddess whose proper name was Anath, JUSt as Baal (Masrer) was the epithet of the god whose proper name was Hadd.u. Now as to the Biblical references to the goddess Astarte, the first mention of her worship by the Hebrews comes from the t:arl~' period of tht:
Judges, soon after till' penetration into C:Inaan: "'And they forsook Yahweh and scr'\'ed the Baal and the 'Ashtaroth."p A linle later more explicitly :
And me children of Israel again did that which \\'as t:\'il in the sight

of Yahweh, and served the Baalim and the 'Ashtaroth, the gods of Aranl, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the go(h of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. and they forsook Yahw(.'h and sen'ed him nOL18
TIlC first purge of the$(.' Baals and Astartes took place .n th(.' bidding of Sanmc!. and was inuncdiatc!y followcd by a decisi\'c inten't"mion by Yahweh in E1\'or of His peopk in their battk against the Philb.tine:.. 2'1 As to th(.' Philistines thefl1S(.'kes. their Astartc must han,: been a e.oddcss of war
as well :lS that of Ion:: :lrld fertility, and this is why, when ~th(., Philistines defc:ltcd S:lul, they deposit(.-ci his armor in the Temple of ':\5hta1"Oth, undoubtedly :lS a token of grarirude,'lO In Chapter I we argued th:lt the goddess whoS(o worship Solomon IIltroduced into Jerusalem in honor of his Sidoni:lrl wife was none other th:m Asherah, the Elath of Sidon, As a rcsult of a confusion ix"tween Asherah and Astarte. which, as we have seen. began with the 14th cenmry RC. E. Amarl1a letters and whose sporadic traces can be found down to Olll" present day, the Hebrew historian of the Solomonic era repeatedly refers to the goddeS!. of whose worship Solomon was guilty as ~'Ashtor(_"{h. the goddess of [he Sidoni:lrls,~ J' In a rt'fcrencc to the same goddess at a later tim(', she I:' no longer accordcd the title ~goddess" but instead is calkd "'Ashtoreth. [h(.· dc-testation of the Sidoniam," l! 11m is how she ill spokrn of by the hilltorian who records that King Jo:.hiah of Judah defikd the high places which Solomon had built for 'Ashtoreth.
31The Archaeological El'idmce
The Goddess Astarte is mentioned onl" nine times in the Bible as against the forty times that Asherah is referred to. The Bible thus fails to con\'!:y :lny idea as to the prevalence of the worship of Astarte among the Hebrews, A som(.·wh:![ better idea C:lrl be gained from the archa(.'Ologicai e"idence rh:lt has come to light in excavations conducted III the last few dCC3des in many partS of Palestine. By the early 1940's, a total of no less than 300 tcrracotta figurines and plaques represenring 3 nude fCll131e figure h3d been unearthed. These nudes fall into several distinct types, sllch as thoSt:' with arms extended to thl' sides and holding stalk.~ or scrpenrs, or with hands holding the breasts, or with one hand placed O\'er one breast and the other m·er the genital region. or with hands crossed before the breasts. Some arc figures of pregnant \\omen. other pillar figurines, etc. The persistence and ubiquity of theSt:' figurinell is remarkable. They h3"e been found in c"cry major exc3\'a{ion in Palestine, and their prevalence extends

The so-called Q:ldesh-rype is dearly :lssociated by its symoolism with a goddess: the other ty\X'S arc assumt'd by most scholars to ha"c been rtprcscntarions of the goddesses Asherah. Astarte. or Anath, although no direct or definite identification could tx: made so far.

However, instead of being conccmcd primarily with finding ever new divine, human, and animal bedfellows. as lshrar was reputed to ha\"(: bccn. Aluth spenr most of her energies on [he banlcficld. She too. to be sure, was a typical goddess of lo\'e, both chaste and promiscuous. Her character
is apt.Iy epitomized in a 13th-ccnrury Be. Egyptian text in which she and Astanc arc c.llkd "the goddesses who cancci\'c but do not bear," meaning that they arc perenni:dly fruitful without ever losing their virginity. In the Ug:uiric myths her conStant ~'pithcr is "the maiden An:uh" or the ..the Virgin An:tth." And, as late an :tuthor as Philo Bybli us, who flourished in the C.;l.rly 2nd century C.E. srill refers to the virginity of .>\oath, whom he identifies with Athena, me famous virgin goddess of me Greeks. Like Ishtar, Aluth was called "lady of hea\'en, mistrcss of all the gods," and, again like Isht:lr.she loved gods. men. and animals. (.x-c Plate 24.) Her foremost IO\-er was her brother B:tal . When she :tppro:tched, Baal dismissed his other wivcs, and she. in prepar.nion for the union with him, built<! In sky-dew and rubbed herself with ambergris from a spenn whale. The :Krual intercourse betwc:cn Anath and Baal is described with a graphic aplicitness which is unique even among the unrestrained accounts of lovemaking usual in ancient Ncar Easrem texts. In a place called Dubr. Baal lay SC\"Olty-sc\"cn timcs with Anath, who assumed the shape of a heifer for the occasion. and, it appears_ thaI the wild bull bom to Baal was the issue of
this union. A mortal 100'er of Allath was Aqhat. whom. after what must have been an intimale lete-a-tete (description unfonunatdy missing). Anath addressed as "My darling greal big he-man!" On the motherly side. Anath was said to h:t\'e oc-cn one of the tWO We01utSCS of the gods. to have given sud:: to a son of King Keret, :tnd one of her appellations was "Progenitrcss of the Peoples." In Egypt, Math came to be regarded as the wife of the
god Seth. and an Egyptian magical text from the 13th century S.C.E. describes
in surprisingly sadistic temlS how Seth deflowers Anath on the seashore. Yet all these adventures in the fields of love pak- to insignific:tnce ne:\"T [0 Anath's great c.xploits in w:tr and strife. In fact, no ancient Near Eastern
goddess was mon: bloodthirsty than she. She was I!asily provoked to \'ioknee and, once she began to fight. would go berserk... smiting and killing right and left. One sees her plunge mw fighting with real pleasure: she

It is a remarkablc fact mat the l1ame Anath is nen:r mentioned in the Bible as rh;}[ of;} foreign goddess. The explanation seems to be that the Biblical authors referred to her by her epither 'Ashtorcth rathcr than b~' her proper name, just as dll'Y rdCrrcd to her Canaanite· Phoenician brotht-T and lon:r by !'us epithet Baal (WLord") rather than by his proper n:unc, Hadd. This. howewr, doc'S not mean that the proper name Math IS entirely ab!.cm from tnt' Bible. Mention IS made of a Cana:llllte town in the [elTlto')' of Naphtali called Ikth Math (-HouS(' of Anath"')," whose inhabitants were subJug:ned bur not dispossessed b~' the Hebrews. Setter-known I" the priestly town of Anathoth, north of Jerusalem (today Anama) which was located III the {elTlto,)' of Benjamin :lnd was the birthplacc of Jeremiah and other Biblical figures. 45 Place names such as thc:.c point to somc connection with me goddess Anath; most probabl~, their founders nan'l<d them after the goddess and III her honor.

was not named after any kxal Math in partirul3r, but :lftcr the Anaths in genera.! who manifested melllscin:s in nlao\' places. The sanle toml, Anath· oth, appears also as the name of tWO men: one of them, a grandson of Benjanlin, livcd in the carly days of [he Israelite ludgcs; the other, a eontlmporary of Nehemiah, after the return from the B3bylonian exile..... From the days of the JUdgl'S the name of another indl\idual sur\,j,·cd, in the slIlgul3r: one of the Judges themselvcs, we read, was a loOn of ;\!lath.

"smote of the Philistines si.x hundred men widl an ox-goad" and rhus savcd Isracl.~ 7 It is tempting to conjccrure dlat Anath was the name of the mothcr (and not of the father ) of Shamgar, and that in the brief norin.- there is a residue of an old myth about a son of the gocldcss Atlath who inherited his mother's warlike qualities. The ox-goad Shamgar used as a weapon reminds us of the tWO bludg1.:ons, Ayamur (~Dri\'Cr") and Yagrush ("'"Chaser""),
which &:tl, Anath's brother and lover, used to defeat his arch-<.-nl-my Yanml.<l.'I The last Biblical reference to Astane-Atlath docs not contain either of these names bur refers to the goddess as "Queen of Heaven:" As we shall recall, the title "L:tdy of Heaven" was gIven to Atlath and Astanc by their Egyptian worshiJX$,4'! which ma.kcs it more likely that the "Queen of Heaven" who forrnc=d the subject of a heated argument between Jeremiah and his Jucbcan feUow-rcfugees in Egypt was none other than the "virgin Anath,~ the "'maid"' Ast::lne. Jeremiah was com·inced. :md tried to convince 3.150 the remnant of Judah in Egypt, that the great n:uional catastrophe that h3.d befallen them had come about as a plmishment by Yahweh for the people's sin of idOlatry. Unless they would repem, the prophet warned them. they would aU perish in Egypt as the others had in Judaea. But the people's interpretation of the downfall of Judaea was diametricallyopposed to that of Jeremiah. They tOO recognized that the calamity that had overtaken them was a divine punishment for a religious sin. but a sin which. they fdt, they had committed against the Queen of Heaven and not against Yahweh. The answer given to Jeremiah by "all [he people that d ,\'c1t in the Land of Egypt, in Pathros"so therefore was:
As for the word that you have spoken to us in the nanle of Yahweh-we shall not listen to you. But we shall without fuil do c\,en'thing as we said: we shall bum incense ro the Queen of Heavcn, and shall pour her libations as we used ro do, we, our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the meetS of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and we all were well and saw no c\·il. But since we ceased burning incense to the Queen of Hea\'en and to pour her libations, we ha\'e wanted everything and have been consumed by sword and fanlinc.
To these words the women added:
Is it that we alone bum incellS(' to the Queen of Hca\"Cn and pour her libations? Is it without our husbands that we m:lke her cakes in her image and that wc pour her Iibations? , 1

The lighting of fire on altars. the bunung of incense, and [he pouring of libations arc all rites well known from both the Jerusalem Temple and the other ancient ~e3r Eastern ntuals. Only the baking of cakt.-:. requires a \\ ord of explanation. In Athens. Artemis was honored with round cakes called sdemn, which rCprCM'ntl-d the moon.

Asram:-Anarh 65
Acre). on a bamah ("high place"). a stone mold was found dating from me 17th century S.CE. The mold was used tor casting small figures of the goddess Astarte-her identity is dearly indicated by the two horns which protrude to the left and right over her cars. She is "Astarte of dle Horns." standing naked, except for her tall. conical headdress, looking down at her protruding navel, with an enigmatic smile on her lips.S<o (See Plate 9. ) Could it be that such molds were used to bake cakes in the shape of Astarte, either to be eaten by the celebrants (perhaps as a precursor of the Holy Communion in which the Host, which is supposed aCtually ro rum into the body of Christ, is eaten) or to be burnt on the altar: More data will be needed 1x~forc this question can be answered, but the possibility that this is what was meant by tht· cakes in the image of the Queen of Heaven is an intriguing one.'s If the equation of the Queen of He3wn with Anath·Asurte is correct, as we believe it to be, then we can den:nnine the period recalled by the Judaean exiles in Egypt as the time of their devoted Astarte worship. As we ha\'e seen abo\'C, the service of Astarte was forcibly terminated by King Joshiah.St.> Joshi:lh's reforms wcrc carried Ollt beginning with the 18th year or his reign,F that is, :lfter the year 621 B.C.E. The contrO\'ersy between Itremiah and the pt-oplc about the Queen of Heaven must have tmn place \\ithin a year or tWO after the arrival of the }lIdaean refugees in Egypt, say, in 585 S.C.E, The Astarre ritual, lorbidden by Joshiah only 36 years previously. could therefOR' have been quite well rmlLTIlocn:d by the older Juda<.-an exiles in Egypt. Since Jeremiah began his prophetic activities in the 13th year of King Joshiah's reign,S~ that is. in 626 B.C. E., his de5Criprion of the worship of the Queen of Hea\'en in Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah must date from the five years that elapsed between 626 B.C.E. and the refom1S of 10shiah in 621. That the Judaean exiles meant what they said to Jeremiah is proved by their hisrory in [he subsequent tWO centuries. In the Jewish military colony at HcnnoJXllis in Egypt, the worship of the Queen of Heaven was pursued
in the 5th cenrury B.C.E. Her temple is mentioned in an Aramaic papyrus from mat conmmniry, side by side with those of other deities. SQ The last mention of the name of the old goddess in a Jewish environm<:nt comes some 175 years arrer the detennined vow of the Judaeans in Egypt to rerum ro [he worship of the Queen of Heaven . In one of the letters written by a member of the Upper Egyptian Jewish military colony on the island of Elephantine, dating from 419 or 400 B.C.E., it is stated that Yedoniah, the son of Gemariah, who was the priest and head of the Jewish community, had collected the following donations; for Yaho (i.e .• Yahweh) 12 brash and 6 shekels: for Ishumbethel7 brash; and for Anath

THE CHERU BIM
Whenever and wherever images were worshiped by th~ Hebrews, as it fu-qucndy happened in the period which cnded with the Babyloni:m captivity of 586 B.C.£.. such practices \vere always and uncompromisingly
condemned in me Biblical and later sources as idolatrous abominations. The legal crystallization of this attitude was the commandment which ruled out the making and worshiping of "gra\'cn images or any manner of likeness." Biblical and subsequent Jewish religion has, therefore, jusrJy been called ....aniconic.., However, it is the exception that proycs the rule. In the case of micaElic Judaism me exception was represented by the Cherubim, those winged human figu res which were an integral part, and according to at least one Rabbinic opinion, the most important part, of all the Hebrew and Jewish .sanctu:uics and temples. The Olcrubim were, by any criu:ria, "gravCl1 images; :lnd ~.et: they continued to figure prominently in the Temple ritual down to the \-cry end of the Second Jewish Commonwealth (70 C.E.).

We cannot: go into a discussion of the numerous nriarions of winged beings, human, animal or composite. which han' been unearthed in excavations in Palestine, Egypt, Mesopotamia and other places in the Ncar East. Let us only mention in passing rim the representation of such imaginary h"brid forms was a favorite theme all over the area for SC\'cral thousands of yors, and that the winged female genii of the Cherub type were merely one of the many sub-varieties of these ubi'luitous crearures of f'3.ntasy. That the Cherubim in Solomon's Temple were human and not animal figures has been comincingly argued by Biblical scholars.~ Others opinioned that they were animal figures, shaped like winged oxen. or winged lions. The- Sanurian i\"o~' plac:Juc suggests that they were. indeed. winged women.

21Tile QJerubim o[the Desert Tabernacle
Let us ka\"( aside the complicated '1uestion of the historicity of the Book of Exodus in general and of the passage describing the Cherubim of the desert Tabernacle in particular. For our prcscnt purposes it makes linle difference whether Exodus truly portrays the conditions of the tribes of Israel dunng their wanderings in the desert in the 13th cenrury B.C.E.. or whether, to take the other cxrremc \otC\v, it represents the ideas of the post·exilic Judac:ms about the carly histo~' of their ancestors after their liberation from Egypt. In any case, as far as the Olerubim in Solomon's
Temple 2rC concerned, it must tx- taken for granted that they were panemed

1'\0 less interesting than the question of the Cherubim's shape IS th:tt of their S~illbolic import, or, to be more precise. of the successive reimerpre(;uions of their s~mbo1ism.

Isaiah, in an eschawlogical "ision, sees Yahweh "riding on a swift cloud"
on His way to Egypt. w -me cloud as the mount of God is personified as a Olerub: "He rode upon a Cherub, and did fI~'; yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind."21 Yahweh's epithet, "Rider in the clouds,~ was paralleled by another which referred to him as "the Siner on the

In a magnificent prophetic epiphany Habakkuk sees Yahweh appearing
in an earth-shaking starn" riding on his horses and chariots, treading the sea with his stallions, and making Clishm and Midian trcmbleY Clouds winds-Cherubim-horses and chariots, all th(.'SC. then, appear as interchangeable concepts in the ?'Xtic and prophetic imagery of the Bible in speaking of the \·ehicle or mount on which Yahweh appears. Of them. only the douds. '(mrbhorlJ in Hebrew, have the feminine fo rm. Yahweh's horses ha\·e the masculine gender, although mares were known to the Bible as Egyptian eh.lriot horscs.H However, there seems to have existed an old tradition which held, possibly under the influence of the She-Cherubs, that God's mount, when in animal sha!X.. was a marc. A late trace of this view is found in the midrash which tclls of God riding a marc - and. in a more danng version, of taking himself the shape of a marc-and being punllcd by the ruttish Egyptian stallions into the Sea of Recds.15 A more personified concept of the Cherubim is expressed in the myth of Genesis, :tccording to which God placed :tt the cast of the Garden of Eden Cherubim with ~the rC\'oh-ing sword of flame" to watch Q\·er the way klding to the Tree of Life.1" Rdated fO mese angel-like Cherubim is the jc-wd-bcdeckcd Chenlb who was set by Go<l infO mt': Garden of Eden until he became overweening and rebcllcdY In connection with the desert Tabernacle there was an explicit mythical tnrlition according to which God descended Onto and into it in a cloud. In fact, the desert Sanmlary was called Tabernacle (Hebrew, mishkrm; literally. "dwelling placc~) because of the divine cloud mat abode (sIJllkIJlw ) O\'cr it and in it. When Moses finished the construction of the Taben13c1e,
the cloud cQ\·ered the Tent of Meeting and the glory of Yahweh tilled the Tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Y:thweh tilled the T:tbcrn:tcle. And whcnc\'t':f the cloud rose up from over the Tabernacle, the Children of lsrad set out on their ;Ourncyings. But when thl.' cloud did nOt risc up, then they journeyed not till tht, day that it did rise up. For the cloud of Yahweh

with the physical appearance of the Cherubim.l.S he himself may have sc.-cn them in Herod's Temple. is shown in his treatise 011 tiJe CiJmlbim. In that book.. soon after sening OUt to explain the significance of the Cherubim whom God placed -aT the East of the g3rden of Eden." he inadvertently slips O\'er into a discussion of the Cherubim figures of the Sanctuary. The passage in which this occurs contains Philo's thn.-c intcrpretltions of the Cherubim:
The Chcnlbim and the sword of flame which rurn~ n·er... wax .. .
arlO an allegorical figure of thc revolution of the whole h·l·ave~ .. . One of the Cherubim then s~mbolizcs the outermost sphere of the fi..xed stars ... the other of rhe Cherubim is the i1mer contained sphere....
This is onc inrerpretation. The second is:
But perhaps. on another imerpn:rarion. the two Cherubim represent the tWO hemispheres [ofhea\'cnl. for we read that the Cherubim stand face ro fuce with the wings inclining [0 the mercy-scat~ 3nd so. too. the hemispheres arc opposite to each other....
The Cherubim which "incline their wings to the mercy·scat~ arc. of course. no longer the li\wg Cherubim who with their flanling sword bar the way to the uee of life. but the sculptured ones which, according to Biblical tradition. were placed into the desert Tabernacle over the Ark. In propounding his third interpretation. Philo ostensibly speaks again of the Cherubim of Paradise. but here. too. he cannot rid himself of the image of the twO Cherubim with the Ark between them:
But there is a higher thought than these.... While Gcxl is indeed one. H.is highest and chiefesr powers arc tWO. evcn goodness and sovereignty. Through HIS goodness He begot all that is. through His so,·ereigmy He rules what He hl.S begotten. And in the midst ben\'een the tWO IS a third which united them, Reason, for it is through reason that God is both ruler and good. Of these n\'o potencies, sovereignty and goodness, the Cherubim arc s~mbols, as the fiery sword is the symbol of reason ... these unmixed porencies are mingled and united ... where God is good, yet the glory of His So\'ereigmy i~ seen amid the beneficence ... where He is SO\'. ereign. through the sovereignty the beneficence still appears. j()
In the Genesis narrative mere is not the slightest hint as to the position occupied by the fiery sword in relation to the Cherubim. To say that ---fhe flaming sword which rumed e\'Cry way" Wl.S ~in the midst beN'een the

tv."O" Ox:rubim and -united them~ is. to say thc least. forced. It IS quite dear that Philo here IS thinking 3gain of thc Cherubim which stood in the
Holy of Holies. with the Ark cQ\'cr (or "mercy .scat") bt.·twccn them 3nd ~' uniring them mto one single picce of StaNary. as explicitly stated
in Exodus: -on one piecc with the ark'eQ\'er shall ye make the Cherubim.~ r 1bt: WlCcnainty in Philo's mind concerning this "third which united" the OIerubim is also indicated bv his inconsistenc" with reEard to the ll\'mool
rhu stood for Reason. In the abow: p:1SS:1gc h~ says th3~ Reason waS s~m·
boIittd by the fiery sword: elsewhert'. howe\'er, he StatCS that God the f;uher is Reason, while Knowledge is God the mother. and mesc tWO aspects of the godhead arc s)mboli7.cd b)' the two Cherubim. Before ruming to the passagcs in which Philo expresses these ideas. let us rM)(C that while in his imerprcr.uions of the Cherubim just quOted the Ilb ofbiscxual symbolism is hinted at or implied. he StOPS shon cspeeially
of sa~;ng anything about a female aspect of God. God's goodness is the ~cttn-, I.e.• the male principle, thill he Stau:s; but he docs not mm God's CIthn- upcct, His SQ\·ercignty. the female principlc; instead. :til he says is tfut ""through HIS so\'creignry He rules what Hc has ocgotten." In speaking of thc creanon of thc world. howc\'er. Philo docs [ake this tLg.h~' Significant step when he says :
... the Architm who made this universe was .u me o,ame time the fathn- of what was thus born. whilst its mother was the Knowledge pos.scsscd by its Maker.

~'St('fTlatically dc\'cl0IX-d in the rh<;osophy of the Kabbala. What is surprismg, at first gi:l.ncc. in Philo's dichotomy of the deity is that he anributcs the ~Iegisb.ri\'c. chastising :md corrt"cting- acri\·ities. as well as the kingl~' powtr, to the female. maternal ~pccr of dci~'. and the "pcaceable. gcmk. wd beneficent" \'irnH':.<;, as well as g<XX:incss. 10 God'~ male. parental aspect. However. there is a logical consistency in thus assigning these tWO SCtS of attributes. The mothtr is the OCarer. num.trcr. educator.

TIle father. who is. of course, the bcgr.'ttcr and creator. is. by romrast to the mother. rcprcscmatin: of gcntkncss. beneficence. gcxxincss. In thus assigning "soft-" qualities to the father. Philo may also hano: had in mind Biblical passages such as "'Like as a father has compassion upon hi~ children, so has Yahweh compassion upon them rhat fcar him,"42 and man~' others which speak of God's compassion; while in charactcrizing thc mother as the maintainer of order. he may ha\'c relied on \'crses which talk of her
as the parent who has to be ooc')·(.-d. or as a ficrce lioness .4.! Howe\'er this nuy be, there can be no doubt that it is in this Philonic doctrine that we havc to look for the carliest roots of medieval Kabbalistic s\mbolism in whidt, as Scholem has pointed Out, "\\"om('n r('prcsent not, as onc mighr be Icmptcd TO cxpt.""(t, thc qU:llity of rcndcme~~. but th:lt of Stem judge· ment," a concept which "was unknown ro the old mystics of thc Merkabah period, and e\'co to [he Hasidlm in Gcrrnanr. but ... dominatl'S Kabbalistic bter.l.turc from the vcry beginning and undoubtedly rcpresents a constiruent dement of Kabbalistic theology.,. .... In the Kabbala. as in Philo, "Kingdom" is the femalc aspeci of the deity (i n the Kabbala '"' Kindgom" is the tenth Sdin. and identical \\'ith tht, Shdmina. the personified. female "Presence" of God). is associ:m-d with the stem, uncompromising. di"ine principle of Justice. while the male aspect is manifested in the qualities of compassion md mercy.

rained in this passage arc identical with those in Kings. except that of the Olcrubim's height which is gi\"cn as ten cubits ( 15 f("Ct ) in Kings and :tS five (7lh: f«1) by Josephus. It seems that by reducing the height of the Otcrubim to one·half of the Biblical figure. Josephus hoped to reduce thelf importancC' as wcll. Preceding the aboo.·C'-quorcd sentences. Josephus dcscribc..·s the walls of the Tcmpk Which, as we shall recall, were dccor:,Ued by alternating figures ofOterubim :md pilin trees as wdl as by fiowt'rs. All that Josephus has to say, howC'ver, is that Solomon. ~as he enclosed the walls with boards of cedar SO he fixed upon them plates of gold. which has sculpmrcs urX:lIl

It is not difficult to surmise his reason:. for so doing. By underplaying the Cherubim in both the d~rt Taocmack and the Solo· monie Temple. he leads up to me total omission of any reference 10 them m his description of the Temple of Herod with which. as a pricst, he had a thcrough, firsthand familiarity. As we shall see belo\\', there can ~. link doubt that there were Cherubim in the Holy of Holies of the Second Temple; they evCf\ played an imporum role in the riNal of the pilgrimage
fcsth.1s.lfJoscphus passes O\u them in silence, his reason, as that of Philo before him. mUSt have been mar as an interpreter of Judaism to the Hd· lcmsrie world in general mel to Rome in particular he \\'as loath to :l.dnllt that anicomc Judaism did, in fact, tolerate the reprcscntation of hllm:m or semi·human and semi·divine figures within the sacred precincts of me lelll'
pk. Wnring as he did after the destruction of the Temple. he wished to portray If as a place of pure spirirual worship, unmarred b~' a.'1Y figure of Ii\'tng Crt'arurcs, whether human, animal or di';ne. To be able to do so, he had to obliterate' the memory of the Cherubim, and he tried to do this by the simple apc=dirnt of silence. It is. howc\TI. not ~' to deny something one knows, and especially when that blowlcdge is of coruidcrabk weight. Josephus Imew that the Holy of Holies contained the StatueS of the Cherubim pair, but he wanted to assert (h:1[ there \\'3S nothing at all in that mOSt holy place of the Temple. lbc result was that he got involved in a peculiar series of self·colltndictions which bear looking into. In one passage he wrires:
lbc innermost pan of the temple of all was of 20 cubits. This was
also separared from the outer part by:l. Veil. In this there was nothing at aJJ. It was inaccessible and in\;olablc and not to be seen by any; and was called the Holv of Holies.s l

Comrast with this what Josephus says m another passage:
... although Thcos [EplphanesJ. and f'bmpey the Great, and Linnius Cr:lSSus. and last of all Tirus Caesar, ha\'e conquered us III war, and gOften possession o f o ur Temple, ~'C1 has none of them fo und :l.I\y such thing [i.e.. an a~'~ head made of gold J there. nor Indeed al1~'thing but what \\as agreeable to the strictest piety; ail/}(Jll...lfh Jl.'lmt the) fomlli 1I'e art ,Wl at librrty to rnval to ot"" ,mtwllS. ...
But for Antiochus IEpiphanesJ. he had no Just C1.llSC fo r that ra\age in OUt temple that he made . , nor dui hefind all:rrlJmg there that Ims ridicukms. . ..
lni) is again contr:ldict(.-d in the \'ery next S(.-a:ion where Josephus says:
, , , nor is therc anything Iin the TcmpleJ. but thc altar Iof inccnse J. the table (of showbrcad j. the censer. and the candlestick, which an'

On the one hand. Josephus felt comtr:lln(.~d to deny the c...istence of any image or object in thc Hol~ ofHolics in accord:mce with hiS tendency to represent Judaism as a purdy aniconie religion m both doctrine and rirual. On the other. he fclt impelled to impress upon hiS readers, and cspccialh' so in his polemical treatise Agaill$t Apum, his own thorough familiarity with e\'en the most SCC«.'1: aspects of Jewish religion : hence the M:ntence on the impcrati\'!:, of secrecy whieh slipped mto his argument. \\llJ.t was there in the Holy of Hohes of which Josephus knew but of which he did not want to speak. we could sumli~. nco withom the e\'ldence of the Talmudic sources. on the basis of his omission of an~' reference to the Cherubim reliefs on the walls of the Temple: it could h3xe hem nothing else but the figures of the (\\'0 Cherubim. These figures, as we know from the carlier evidence of Philo J.$ well as the later one of the Talmud, had :lS5umed. by the beginning of the 1st eenrury C.E.. the character

As to the rime whm the Cherubim were shown to the fX'Ople filling the courtS of the Jerusalem Temple. the only statement we ha\'c is thlt of Rabh Qcrina: the shOWing, and the accompan~'ing explanation. were made "whO'! Israd m3de the pilgrimage" to the Temple. According to Biblical command, cvcry malc Israelite was duty-bound to make the pilgrim3ge to
me Ttmplc three rimes a year: on Passo\·er in the spnng; on the Fe3St of Wetks, sc\'en weeks later; and on the Feast of Booths (Sukkoth) which fdl in aurumn, t\\'o weeks after New Year.6() Of the three. the gre3test and most enthusiastically celebrated was the last one. on which, more than on any odIc:r Hebrew holiday. the populace was commanded to rejoice.'" From descriptions contained in the \_1ishna and in Talmudic sources we know not only the ritual details of fiis joyo~ feast,": but also the fact rh3t both men and women participated in it. and that on the sc\,enth day of the festival the: tvm sexes used to mingle and commit what is euphemistically referred to as "lightheadedncss." We can only sUnllise that the showing of the Cherubim reprcscnting a male and a female figure in marital embracc, may have prt«dc:d, and. indeed. incited the crowds to. the commission of this "Lighthcadcdnc:ss.:' which could ha\'e lx.-c:n nothing bur an orgiastic outburst of sc:xuallicense. Such rimal license was in accordance with both old Hebrew prlcrice and the religious customs of other ancient Ne:tr Eastenl peoples. As to its Htbrew antecedents. we h:tpJX'n to know from the incident of the Golden C2lf that scxull rioting W3S the trJ.dirion31 response to the exhibition of

It was, one might say, standard practice of the culoc \'el1l'ratiol1 of the divine powers of life 3J1d fertility. As Nclson Glueck recently obseryt'd: "The excitement of pagan worship .md pJ.rtiCiparion III fe:u.ts of sacrificial ofll:rings apparently often led male and f~male worshipers to JOIl1 together in fC\'crish consummation of fertilin' rites."<>i The mythic:l1 countt:rp.ut of this orgiastic riru:ll was, in :lncient Israel as well as among the orher ancient l\'car Eastern peoples, the great emmogonical and cosmological myth cyck, according to which the annual perioo ofvegetltin: fertility was preceded by a union of the m:lk J.nd female clements of nature. To ensure th:lt this great cosmological copula.tion take place in the proper measure and with the requisite intmsity, man him:.clt: it was fdt, had ro perform the sacred sex act, thereby both indicating to the clements of nature what was expected of them and inducing them to do the S3J11e through the compulsive force of a rdigio-magical act.t<.' Howcvcr, what was considered in earlier da\'.'> as a pr0l-x:r manifestation of popular enthusiasm at the sight of dinnc statuar\", Ix'came intolerabk III the eyes of the sages, probably 10 the last century of the e:mn:nCe of the Second Temple oflerusa!cm. They felt the\' had to put an end to the fcsti\"c "lightheadcdness," and wht'rc originally the \\"omen used to gather in the Great Courtyard of the Temple, the so-called Women's CoUrt, while the men stood without, they ordered that tht· two sexes should change places, in the hope that this would prevent the repetition of the mass orgy. Howe\'er, next year, th''"y had to witness the futility of [heir mcasme, pro\,lng to them once ag:l.ln th:lt in the hour of JOY the "e\'il mciinatlon," that is, the sexual drive, is apt to O\'t'rpower both men and women. Thereupon they had special galleries built on thrC"t' sides of the courtyard, leJ.\,lng open only the side which faced the Sancruary, and confined the women to them."" When th is important rdoml took pbce, we do nor know. Bur we can understand, to some extent, the srubbom popular resistance to it if we assum(." that the exhibition of the Cherubim in embrace Wl$ continued at dlC three annual feast.'> of pilgrimage, while at tht' .'>anll" time the populace was prcvented b~' the rci()ITn from indulging in its old traditionJ.] practice of imitatw dei called lor by the momentary glimpse of divine my~tery.

In contrast to Nehuchad1'I(12;lr, who was not interested in combating the religious beliefs and praenecs of the Judaeam•• Antiochus Epiphancs was pa.ssionately intent on mdi.;3ring Jud::tism. He may h::t\'e seized upon the opportunity of publicly hunuliallng the Jews by parading the Cherubim in the streets. Another consideration which points to the same conclusion is mar it is much more likely [hat rhe sages of the Talmud, in whose names the Oltrubim incident is recorded. would retain an oral tl':ldition eonceming 0Ul t:\'Cn! that had occurred four centuries earlier, in rhe days of Antiochus Epiphancs. rathc-r thall one that had taken place almost nine centuries before d!cir rime.

Among the scan~· documents relating to the second Jewish commonweaith. then: is a link book about whose historici~' there has been much S('holarly conrro\'e~y. It is the ~+calkd LUter ofAristcas, which was wrim:n in Greck. in Alexandria. in all probabili~' shortly after 132 BCE.:"U This m~atisc ha:. the pscudepigraphic form of a knet wrinen by Aristeas, a gentile. to his brother Philocrates during the reign of Ptolem~' II Philadelphus (285-247 H.CE.). and it discusses three major subjects: the golden n.-sscis Ptokmy had made for the Jerusalem Temple; the tr.msbtion of the Pent:Heuch prepared at his insistence; 3nd 3 series of questions conceming kingship he put to the Jcwish sa.ges, together with the l3ner's philosophical· moralistic 3nswetS. The overriding 3im of the tre:uisc was to dcmonstrate the excellence of Jewish religion 3nd the folly of idol:ltry. ~l In spite of the late date of its composition-at least 120 years after the events described in it-and its ample legendary embellishments. ArirUlU seems to contain :I. solid kernel of historical truth. As to the translation of the Pentateuch II1ro Greek.. tor inst:l.nce. schol:1.rly opinion is that. whether tht' story raid in A nsttas of rhe 72 elders sent by the Jerusalem High Priest Eleazar to .-\lexandria to do the rran~lation is true or not. it seems to be a historical f:l.ct that the Pentateuch was translated in the time of Ptolemy II. tor it fitted in With his general policy of Hclkniz.:nion.4l It seems to me that precisdy tht· same argument supports also the historici~' of rhe presents of exquisite Alexandrian \\·orkmaJ1~hip which. according to AristttJJ. were scm by Ptolemy II to the Jerusalem Temple. It is in this event that we can find a clue as to the insrallation of the Cherubim-in-embrace into the Hal\' of Holies. The prCS("nrs were rirual objects. mostly Jl1:1.de of gold. to whOS<.· descnp

Even as late as the: early 1st century CE., King Monobaz and Quecn Helcna of Adiaocne (a kingdom on the left bank of

Thus when Ull" old c:'m · bals and copper mort:lr, which, according to mdition, dated "from the (bys of Moses," became damaged, they were repaired by Alexandrian craftsmen; when the f:lmily of Garrnu refilscd to dimlge the trade-secrets of the preparation of the showbread, and :lgain, when the members of the Eutimos family did the same with reg:lrd to the preparation of the incense, the sages tried to brc:lk the monopolies ofthcsc artisan families by sending for AJcxandrian Jewish expertS. While all this took place about the middle of tht~ 1st century C.E.,s1 tht practice of importing .>\lexandrian artifacts to lemsalem must have ocgun with the spread of Hellenism to Pakstine and Egypt. The first half of the 3rd century B.C-E., described in Aristms as a f'\:riod of what today would be called "interfaith cooperation" ben\'cen Jerusalem and Ale.\:andria, seems to be the most likely tim(· for the introduction of a ncv..

The Cherubim 93
As to the: Kabb:!.Ia. it found in the CherublJ1l-in-embraee a most welcome basis for two of irs cemral doctrines: ont'. that only the' rogetherness of mak and female is a state of blessedness; and rwo, th:u when ;1 man sins l\( thereby causes the separation be['.n.'en the male and female aspectS of ;1 deity (of which morc in the ncxt ['.m ch3pters). which. In rum, leads to a rranscendental and univers31 disaster. In the Zohar. the mngmml opus of 13th-ccnrury Spanish Kabbala. tht'SC ['.\'0 ideas are expressed as follows:
Three time a day a miracle took place with the wings of the Cherubim. When the holiness of the king [i.e.. God} rC\'cakd itself o\'cr them. the Cherubim. of the'mscl\·cs. nretched out their wings and covered thcir bodies with them.... A cloud descended, 3nd when it settled ulXln the Lid. the wings of the CherubIm intem\·jned and they beat them and ~allg a song.... And the Priest in the Tcnlple heard their voices as hc was putting the incense In its place.... The ['.\'0 Cherubim. aile male and one female. both sang.... "And he he3rd the Voice speaking UntO him ... from between the ['.vo Cherubim. and He spoke unto him." R3bbi ¥it
zhak said: From this we leam that God is ~iust and right."91 th;u is, male- and female, and likewise the Cherubim were male and
female.Ql
We shall easily recogni7..e in this passag.e a late \'arianr of the theme we
first found adumbr:lted b" Philo ['.vdve hundred vClrs earlier: the male and female Cherubim reprcsenring the male and female dement in God, The Talmudic \'iew quoted abo\'e to the effect that the position of the heads of the Cherubim changed. refi('cring the 0101':11 l)(.:ha\·ior of Isr:ld. is :li<;() clabo or.ucd in the Zoh:lr:

:.rood for an independent, feminine di\'inc entlry prompted by hcr compassionate naNre to argue With God in defense of man. She is thus. if not b~ character. thcn by function and position. a direct heir [0 such ancient Hebrew goddesses of Cana:mirc origin :is Ashcr:ili and Anath. How did the Shckhina originate and dt·velop. and what did she mcan for T3lmudic Judaism~ These arc the questions that we sh3.l1 :lnempt to ansWer in this chapter.
11The "DlI'c/l;,W' oj God
In Biblical times. when God was imagined to dwdl in or ride upon douds. as Baal h3d done III the older Canaaniu:" m~'thol~..1 the m~"thological valid:uion of the s:mctiry of the desert Taocrnacle and the Solomomc Temple was thc myth of Yahwch descending in a cloud into the S3l1cruary.l The presence ofC-.od 10 this "cloud ofYahwch",J was regarded as somcrhmg more rmgiblc mm its visual aspect: because of the cloud.
96



The Shekhin3 97
MMose.s was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting."· Similarly, after the completion of Solomon'5 Temple, "the cloud filled the House of Yahweh so that the pricsts could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the Hou.sc of Yahwch." 5 The archaic n:l.tuI"C of this mythologcm of the deity'S physical presence in his temple is arrcsted by the poetic passJ.gc following the ahm'c statement: Then spoke Solomon:
Yahweh meant to dwell in darkness. But I built a house for Thee A scat to abide in forever.'"
A careful perusal of the passages refcrring to the manifestation of God in the ~cruary shows th:u me nouns ~doud" and "glory" arc used interchangeably, and that the McioudM was undoubtedly regarded as rhe visible form taken by the "glory" of Yahwch when He wished to indicate His presence in His earthly abode, the sanctuary: Since Yahweh was belie\'ed to have "dwelt" in the descrt Tabemacle,
one of me n:uncs of mat tLi1t-sanctuary was mishhm, "dwelling" or "atxxic.'" According to the oldt'r Elohistic tradition. Yahweh merely PO[ in temporary appearances in the Tent of Meeting; he was a visiting deity whose appearance in, or depanure from, the Tent was used for oracular purposcs.'1 In contrast, the younger Priestly rradition makes Yahweh a pennancm inhab1tant of this sacred Abode, 10 thus rerrojccring into the mythical past a belief that \\as an integral part of the Jerusalem-centered theology of tht, brer monarchy, i.e., that Goo's pcnnanent abode was on Mount Zion, in His holy Temple. 11
2 1lfokbma- Wisdom
While the quasi-physical manifest:lt1on of God's "dwelling" in His sanctuary is thus an integral feature of Biblic:aJ theology, the [enn Shekhina docs not occur in the Bible. Howeyer, in the l:ne Biblical pcriod a ul!.:ologita! tendency made its appearance which prepared the ground for the emergence of the Talmudic Shekhina. The trend n:ferred to is mat of interposing personified mediating entities betwe('n God and man_ These entities, originally conceh'cd of either as having been crcatc..'d by God or as being His :l.ttributcs or emanations. gradually developed into angel-like beings who 2Ct upon man and the world under instruction by God_ The most frequencly :l.ppe:tring of these intcnnc.:diarics. or hypostases (as thc..")' arc called), is Ifokbma. or \\rLSdom. In the Book of JobY Wisdom is dc:.cribed as a personage



98 The H ebrew Gcxidcss
whose W:J.y is understood :J.nd pl:1ce kno wn only by GOO himsclf. while tht·
Book of Proverbs L.! :J.SSCrts that Wisdom was the e:J.rlicst creation of GOO, and that ever since those prime\'al days she (Wisdom) has been GOO's pla~ma[c.
In rhe Apocrypha. this rolt- of Wisdom is e\"en more emphasi7..cd. L4 A passage is the Wis"dom o!Soumw1J statt'S that ~she IWisdom J proclaims her noble birth in that it is gi\'t~n to her ro live with God, and the Sovereign Lord of all lo·..ed her. ..."l~ Ir was obscl'\"t.::d by Gcrshom Scholt-m that the tenn wsymbiosis~ used in rhis p~sage appears again in the same chapter III the sc.n:.c of marira.J connubium, and that it is therc:fore de:tr th:tr Wisdom here was regarde::d as God's wife::. L~ Philo St:l.tC:s quite unequivocally th:u God is the husband ofWisdom. L' Wisdom pl:tyed a particularly important role among the Jewish Gnos· tics. References to the role of Wisdom in the primordial days of the world :.c::e::m to indicate the existence of a Gnostic l:Iokhm:t-myth which originatt-d in Jewish cirdes :tnd was hypothetically reconstnlcted as follows: Out of the primeval Ch:tos God created the scven archons through the intemlediaey of his Wisdom. which was identical with the wdew of light."' Wisdom now cast her eidolon, or shadow·im:tge, ujX>n the primcval w:ttcrs of the Tohu wa·Bohu. whereupon thc archOIl) fonned alt' world and the body of man. M:J.n cr:J.wkd about upon thc earth like a worm, until Wisdom endowed him with spirit. S3tan, In the shape ofthc M::rpcnt, had intercourse with Eve who thereupon bon.' Cain and Abel. Thus sexuality became the origin:tl sin. Alter the Fall. the sons of Scth fought the sons of Cain. When the daughters of Din seduced the sons of Seth, Wi~om brought the Rood UfXlil the eann. Later, in hl·t cfforts to help mankind, Wisdom sent sc\·cn prophets, from Moses to Ezr::t, corresponding to the scwn planets. In rhe myth Wisdom. acting like a female deity, clearly resembles the Gnostic con· cept of the allima mtmdi, the ~wor1d soul?''' Whether this myth recon5[ruction is or is not correct in all details could be dccidc..-d only on the basis of a thorough srudy of Jewish, Early Christian. and Gnostic sourccs, Howe"er, there can be link doubt as to the import:tncc of Wisdom in Jewish Gnosticism. which built its speculations on me rok assigned to l:Iokhma in the late books of the Bible itself While Wisdom thus had all the prerequisitcs for developing into a \"{"fit3.bJc female deity, no such dcn:lopmcnt rook. pl:tcc within Judaism. Instead. post-Biblical Judaism creac(.-d for itself a new concept of femini ne divinity in the figure of rhe Shekhin:t, \\'ho first appears in the Ar::tmaic translation-p3raphrasc of the Bible, the so-called Tar.l1u m Onkelos. Whilt- the exact dare of this work. is still in doubt (some scholars hold that it was written as e:trly as the 1st cenmry C.E, while others think that it had not

3 IThe Early Shekhilla
Shekhina (slrkbi"ab) is a Hebrew abstract noun derin:d from the BibiKal verb sJmkhan discussed above :md mems literallv "'the act of dwellmg:' These abstract nouns. constructed from the verbal root-letters with the added -alJ suffi.'\, havl,: the feminine gender. In actual usage. the term Shckhina. whrn it first appears. means that aspect of the deity which can be apprehended by the senM:S. \Vhenever the original Hebrew Biblical text spc:tks of a manifestation of God through which He was perceived by man.
the TIl'lJum Onkelos interpolat~ the tem1 Shekhina. For instance. the verse
"Ln them make Me a Sanctuary that r may dwell [w'lImkbantll among thon,~19 is rendered by the Ta':.lIlwl Onkeles as follows: ....Let them make
before Me a Sancturary that I may let l"ly Shekhina dwell among them.~
The original ~I Will dwell [R.Jslmkhamll among th~· Children of Israd ... dut I m::ay dwell [pslJoklmll among them."lObecomes in the Targll1n wi will kt M~' Shekhina dwell among the Children of Israel ... that I may let My Shekhina dwell among them." The Biblical "that they ddile not their camp Ullo\'host midst I dwell~ l l becomes "that they defile nor their camp in whose midst My Shekhina dwells.~ 22 1"e Tm'glwl, evidently, could not tolerate a dirm reference to God e\'en in a poetic text, and thus it paraphrases the
origmal '"He (GodJ found him (Isr:td I in a dl."Sert l:tnd ... He comp:t1>)Cd him abouT . .. WH as follows: "He filk-d th(.·ir needs III a desert land . .. He let them dwell around His Shekhina . . . ~ From these exanlplcs. to which many more could be added. l~ it appears dut the earliest usc of the tem1 Shekhina was in the sense of an abstract hypostaSis, inrerpolatl~d where"cr a Biblical st:ttement :tppcared to be too anthropomorphic TO the greater sensitivity of a later :tge. The fact that the noun Shekhina had the feminine gender (Shdwima in Aramaic) had no signi6cmce at all in these early references. In me Talmudic literature. thc tem1 continued to be used in the same sense. E.g.• Rabbi Ychoshua. a 1st-2nd cemury Palestinian teacher. sta[($ dw me foUowing fcarures were en;eyed by Israel in the desert: the manna. the quails. the well, the T:tbcmade. r1w Shckhina, tl1e priesthood, the kingship, and the Clouds of Glory.lS A Talmudic discussion Aarly I.-quates God 1o\1m the Shckhina: wRabbi 'lose (2 nd cennJry) said: 'Never did the Shekhina dC$Ccnd to eanh. nor Moses and Elijah asccnd to hea\·cll ... .' It is
corrta that me Shckhina never descended to eanh? Is it not wrinen. 'And Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai .. .'?" 1b



100 11,e Hebrew Goddess
At the same rime" howe"er there is ;I tendency to endow the Shekhm:a with more physical attributes than those associated with God, and thus to distinguish tx."twccn the deity Himsclfwho is beyond all sense-perception and His tangible manifestation ~ rhe Shckhina., Om: passage in which thLS ph~'s ic:l.l view of the Shck.hina is exprcsscd wim great clarity is the following :
All those yC:l.r5 that lsrad was in the descrt, these two caskets, one of a corpse (of JoscphJ and the other of the Shckhina (containing the m 'o stone tablets of tht, L:1W] wm: carried [by the hradncs J side by side. When the passersby would S3y: "What is the naNre of these n\'o c3sk('ts?~ the\' would answer: "'One is the casket of a corpse, and the other of the Shckhina." ""Is it the custom that a corpse should be carried with the Shckhina?" Thc~' would answer: "'This one [i.e. Joseph], ob&.,....'Cd what is written in the other onc.~:~
It is e,·idenr thar the presence ofrhe Shekhina in the casket is imagined in this passage in a manner corresponding to that of Joseph':. body in thc other caskt:t -both arc actual. physical presenccs. Similarly. the Biblical notion that the laocn1adc W:lS built in orda to scr.·c as a dwelling place for Yahweh is transformed in Talmudic litcrature inro me idea that both the descn s:lIlctuary a.nd the Solomonic Temple wcre me eanhl\' abode of the Shekhina. It was the Shekhina who. according to
Rabbi ...u:aria in the name of Rabbi Ychuda bar Simon, the 4th-cen~rv Palestinian Amora. dwelt in the Temple, lining it, as it were, with 100·e.:'.I' The norion is made rangible by Rabbi Yehoshua ofSikhnin is the name of Rabbi Le\'i, a 3rd-4m century Pakstinian Amora:

According to Rabbi Ychoshua (end of 1st century C.F.)•

According to another opinion how(,'\"(.:r, the Shekhina originaUy did dweU here below. on carth. However. when Adam sinned, she removed herstlfto the first hL"a\'cn. When the generation afEnash sinned. she moved up from me first to the second hC:l\'cn. The sins of rhl" generation of [he Deluge caused her to withdraw [0 the third heaven; most': of the gent'ration ofthc Tower of Babel-to the fourth. When the Egyptians sinned in the days of Abraham. she withdrew to the fifth hC3\"Cn. The sins of the Sod~ omitcs impelled hcr to seck refuge in the seventh heaven. But when the 5C''m righteOUS men (Abraham. Isaac., Jacob. Levi. Kehar•.-\mram., and Moses) arose, they brought hcr back down ro earth step by step.31 Since the Shekhina dwelt in me Temple, any desecration of the holy place affronted her directly, When King Manassch set up a graven image in the house of God, he did mis purposely so that me Shekhina should see
in and be angered,)2 It .....as a Talmudic tenet that the physical presence of the Shekhina in
the Temple, or in any othcr place on earth, was of such a nanlre that it could be localized, and her mOH'.mcnrs from place to place followed, The Ws.sieal expression of this \'iew is the statement of Rabbi Yehud::a ben Idi in the name of R::abbi YoJ:tanan bar N::appa~a (3 teacher in Tibc.'rias who died In 279 c.E.), ::according to which the Shl'khina went through the fol, leNing ten stages of wandering:
From the ark-cO\'er she ITKwed onto the Cherub: from the Cherub OntO the other Cherub; from the second Cherub Onto th,' threshold of the Temple; from the threshold into the Court of the Priests; from the Court OntO the airar in the COUrt; from the altar OntO the f'<X>f of the Temple; from the roof onto the wall; from the wall into the city of Jerusalem;

As [Q the presence of thc Shekhina in the Second Temple, opin· ions were di,ided. Some said clut while in the First Temple the Shckhina dwelt continuously. in the $c.-cond Temple she was present onl~' imemlittenclyY Some sages, howe\'cr. like the 4th·century C.E, Palestinian Amora. Shemuel ben lnya, asserted that the Shekhina never graced the &:-cond Temple with her presence. and that this circumstancc constituted one of the sc\'cn features marking the infcriori~' of this sanctuary in comparison with thc First Tcmple.M Rabbi Yobanan. too. was of the opinion that the Shckhina never dwelt in the Second Tt'mple, me reason being thar it was built with the aid of the Sons of Japheth. i.e.. clK' Persians, and, as stat(·d in Gencsi:. 9:27, God dwells only in clle (ents of Shem. that is in a Temple built b,' the Children of Israel themselv~..w Again others held nm only thai the Shekhina was Pfl..'SCnt in the St'Cond Templc.40 but mat, following its destruction, she transferred her sc::at to several important syn::agogues in Babylonia, where her presenc(' was both visible and audible. Espcciall~' two syn::agogucs. those of Huz.al and Sh::af Weyatibh. had the reput::atJon of serving as alternate dwelling places for the Shekhina. The Sh:li Wey::atibh s~nagogue in Nehardea was built. accordmg to tradition, by King Yc:chonia and his men. of stones and dust they had brought along from Jerusalem;·! At times the Shekhina would dwell in this synagogue, at others in that of Huzal . Once, so the story goes. the fathers of Shemud and Levi were sitting in the ShafWeyatibh synagogue in Nehar· dea when the Shckhina appeared making a noise. whereupon they gOI up and lelT. On another occasion, blind Rab Shc:shct sat in the same synagogue when the Shekhina a~in camc, but he made no move to leave. Thereupon ministering angels came to frighten him away. but he said: ~Master of the World! If one is affiia('d and the orner is not. who is to yicld?~ Whereupon He (i.e., the deity) spoke to them: ~Let him be!"': As to the precise nature of the noise made by the Shekhina, anomer Talmudic passage dcscribcs it as follows: "The Shekhina rang before him

According to a Palestinian vicw, transmitted to Babylonia by Rabh Dimi (early 4th century C.E.) , the Shckhina spoke to Adam, to the Serpent, and to the fishes, and, as a consequence of this distinction. members of these three species copulate in :1 fucc-to-f.:J.cc position. whik all the other animals perform the sexual act face-tO-back. ~~ That thc Shekhina can be Sloen is almost a commonplace in the Midrash. The sign of the Abrahamic covenant which thc Children of Israel carried on thcir Resh enabled them to gaze- at the Shekhina; had it not been for dw= circumcision, they would ha\"e fallen Rat on their faces at her appearmee,to En:':n Nadab and Abihu. the twO rebellious contemporaries of Moses, "feasted their eyes on the Shekhina. but had no enjo~ment from hcr; Moses. on the other hand. did nor feast his eyes on her. but enjoyed her."·~ Already as:l babe.

These, and many other similar passages clearly demonstrate a pro~ tendency to personify the Shekhina and to conceive of her as a nunifesution of the deity in a lower form, capable of being perceived by the human scnsc:s. This Shekhin:l was me dIrect heir of me Biblical Cloud oCG\or\' which h:ld dwelt In the smouarv and hld been the visible ffi:lIl
Ifesn~ of Yahweh's prc.'iC'nce in H is Ho~sc. There is as yet no indication in any of these passage~ that the Shekhina was considered a dl\'me entity separate from God to the extent of being :1ble to confront him. Howe\'er, III \iew of the mystical dualistic rhl.-"Osophy of Philo and the ChemhimS}mbolism of thc Second Temple,.... If was me\'itablc that the step from regarding the Shekhina as the m:lI1itestarion of God to seeing 111 her a disactt di\;nc entity should be taken . The earliest t.·\'idcnce that it was. dates from the end of the 3rd ccmur\, C.F Before presenting the passage in quc>tion, a word must be said abom the relationship of the rwo Talmudic concept .~ nf the Shekhina and of the
"Holy Spirit." As A. Marmon!ein has convincingly ~hown, the~ tWO COllcqx:s. were: used synonymoll!>ly in the Talmudic pcriod."- Wht'n, therefore. I Tmnuruc teacher spcab of the Holy Spirir. he may as well ha\'c u~d the tmn Shekhina. With this in mind, let us quote a saying o f Rabbi ADa, a <Alikan teacher who lived ca. 300 C. E.
The Holy Spirit comes [0 the defense [of sinflll Israel byI saying first to Israel: '·Be nor :1 wimcss :1gainst my neighbor withom a Cluse;03 and thereafter saying to God : "SlY nor: I will do to him :as Ix: ham done to me .~ ""
This passage has great slgnificmce in the hi.!.roric:tl development of the lnish God concept. We have here a very early testimony as to the idea that the "'Holy Ont.-. blessed be He~ or God, and the Shekhin.l or Holy Spirit, arc two separate and discrete divine entities. The Holy Spirit is sJid here to h3\'e admonished God not to practiCl~ rt.'tribution and to refrain from punishing Israel. She (she. because rhe " Holy Spirit.~ like the Shckhina. is fanininc) was. therefore. considered to ha\'e an opinion. a mind, :1 will,
and :l pmonality of her o wn. She is opposed to God and tries to inRuence
him....

The following statement by Rabbi AQa defimtely points in that direction:
When the Shekhina left the Sancruary, she returned to caress and
k.is~ irs walls and columns, and cril'd and said: "Be in peace. a my

In another passage it b the Community of Israel (Knesseth \'israd. also of feminine gender and subsequenuy identified with the Shekhina or symbolized by her), lamenring the destruction of the Temple:
lne Community of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed by He: -Master of the World! I remember the safety, the security and the peace which I lIsed to enjoy. and now it is all departed from me. And I cry and lament and say: 0, if I could rerum to fonner years when the Sanctuary ~tood, and when yOll used to come down into it from the high heavens, and le[ yo ur Shekhina rest on me, and the narions of the world would praise me!

My hc:m breaks in me when I pass by your house and It is dl-stroyed. and the voice of silence is in it and says: The place in which Abraham's seed prc:scntcd sacrifices before ~'ou, and the priCSts stood on their platform, and the U:\'ites intoned praise on their harps. how can it be that now foxes dance III it?! , . .

That the Shckhina is the love aspect of God is dearly stated in a parable which compares the Temple to Solomon's palanquin: Just as the latter was inlaid with love, so did the Shekhina fill the s:mcruary.81 But she also represents the divine punitin: power. This is most sllccinctly expressed in a Tannaitic pass..'ge which state; that on ren occasions did the Shekhina descend from on High: after the Fall, when she emered the Garden of Eden to punish Adam, Eve, and the Serpent; when she confused the builders of the Tower of Babel; when she destroyed $adam and Gomorrah; when she saved the Children of Israel from Egyptian sla\'er:-': when she drowned the Egyptians in the Sea of Reeds; when she app<.-ared on Mount Sinai; when she led the Children of Israel in rile pillar of cloud; when she entered the Sanctuary; and once more will she descend in the furure in the days of the battle of Gog and Magog.gl We note that in the above list, which actually enumerates only nine descents - one evidently got lost while the tradition still circulated ora.lly-6yt· descents of the Shekhina are punitive expeditions. As we shall see in a subsequent chapter, the punitive aspect of the Shekhina, closely paralleled by the cruel aspect of the ancient Near Eastcm lo\'egoddesses, plays an important role in the Kabbalistic figure of the ShekhinaMatronit. A mi.xnlre of the punitiYC and the merciful aspens of the Shekhina appears in the legends which attribute to her the function of taking the souls of exceptionally meritorious men_ There were six individuals, we read in the Talmud. whom rhe Angel of Death could not O\-ercome, and who died only rhrough a kiss of the Shckhina; tht,y were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam .8~ According to another passage, it was Goo who took rile soul of one of them. Moses, by kissing him on the mouth.s-. But after Moses died, it was the Shekhina who carried him on her wings a distance of four miks to the place where he was ro lx' buricd. 8s Since Mo.sc.s is said to have to given up all camal contact with his wife in order to be always ready to receive communication from the Shckhina, it seems probable that a notion dearly stated in the Zohar was already

present in rudimentary form in Talmudic times: the idc:1 that the rc1:nionship between Moses and the Shckhin3 was like that ofhusb:md and wlfe.1It> If so, then.- is an interesting parallel bcn\'ccn the Shckhina carrying hcr dead husband.

We han: followl'd. in this chapter. the dc"dopmcllI of the Shekhina concept from its Biblical :um:ccdcnts. through its carl" Targumic bcginning:~ in the 1st or 2nd century B C.E, to the stage it reached a thousand yean later.

By interpolating (he Shckhina. it was no longer God himself who was said to haw acted in a human manner, but his "'presence" which, ("\1dentl~', was concei"ed as something akin [0 a ~prcscnC('~ manifesting itself at a spirirualisrs' seance, a barely \"isible indication of what is acknowledged to be pure spirit and therefore not apprehensible by the senses.

THE KABBALISTIC
TETRAD
Let us now tum to the development of me Hebrew goddess myth
in the Middk Ages, whm the mythical-mystical figurt- of 3. feminine divinity occupied 3. central place in Jewish religious consciousness. There arc some puzzling factors about this medieval Jewish religious development. One is that it took place in an entirely religion-bound community, whose official doctrines could nevcr have tolerated deviation from strict monotheism. Another, that, on the surface at least, it appears as if the prirn3.ry f:J.ctor in the emergence of the goddess figure and her divine family had Ix'cn mystical speculation about the nature of the deity, which in rum led to the creation of mythical narratives about the relationship among the tour members of the supernal Tetrad. There is, of course, no hard and fast dividing: line between mvstic3.l symbolism and mythical narrative. On the contrarv, these two areas of religIous c.xpression imperceptibly merge, and those whose religious inClinations impel them to approach tne border region from either side. may suddenly find that they have crossed over to the other. Historical examples show that at times sllch crossmgs·over \\'cn: effcctcd purposely: old polytheistic myths wcre. in this manner. rransfomlC(1 into m~'srical rheological idcas and thereby fined into [he framework of a narrower. more. rigidly monotheistic religion.

The best known, though not always readily rlcknowledged, example of this type of transformation is the re-emergence:: of the aneiem Ne:tr Ewem m~'thologieal feaNre of di'me triads (a group of three gods) in me Chrisrian docrrine of the Hoi\' Trinitv.
At other times, the ~arehing mind, striking our along unexplored prlths of religious discO\·ery. finds itself on the other side. hrlving erossed the imisibJc border unintentionally and inadvcrtently. Such rln accidental slipp3ge from the realm of mystical speculation into that of mythical narrativc occurred in connection with the Kabbalistie interpretation of the mysticrll meaning of the Tetragrammaton, the secret and most holy four-lcrrer name of God. which to pronounce was considrt.-d a mortal sin. An examination ofthe psychological and traditional channels along which this slippage took place will occupy us in this chapter. together with the anempt to reconstruct the myths of the four di"inities constiNting the Kabbalistic tetrad. First. however. let us look at the world of the Kabbala in which this tetr.l.d occupied a pivotal position.
1 IT1Je Kabbala
The Kabbala was a great Jewish religious f1lO\'Cf1lI...Tlt which rt.oached its literary zenith in the 13th cenNry, and irs greatest popularity in the 16th and 17th eenruries. Its roots go back to Talmudic notions and ideas. and ""en beyond them, to doctrines first adumbrated by Philo of Alexandria. the 1st ccnNry Hellenistic Jewish philosopher. whose teachmgs about the Cherubim were examined in Chapter Three. Central to the Kabbala is a secret and esoteric doctrine about the nrlrure of thc deity and the rdationship between God, World. and Man. While the Kabbala as a whole is deeply mysticaL it is speculative rather th:m c::c:sutic. It emphasizes the inruith'e grasp of ultimate truths. but at the same time demands the most exacting observance of all the laws and rules of traditional Judaism. It stresses the personal religious experience. yet. paradoxically. it considers itself as a l:xx:i)' of old. transmitted wisdom. as indicated by the meaning of its very name, Kabbala. litcrally "'Rc::cep[ion,'" that is. something "received" from aneicnt mastcrs. In fact. the chain of Kabbalistic tradition is belie\X.-d to lead back fO Adam himself, whose knowledge of all the ultimate secn:t.s was derived directly fTom d ivinc conmmnication.1 The foundations of medieval Kabbalism were laid in Babylonia and Byzantium in the 7th and 8th centuries. when a number of Midrashim \\ith marked Kabbalistic tendencies made their appearance. Several ofrhese (e.g.• thc Alpha Beta ofRabbi Abba and the Midrruh K(men ) deal with the mysteries of Crcation and the structure of the univcrse. Other writings of thc

religious need .... It says something for its vitality that despite the opfX>sition of such fX>werful forces [as the philosophers and the T:lJmudist-~] this idea became parr and parcel of me creed of wide circles among the communities of Europe and the East.l
111<' Zohar and the later Kabbalistic works are replete with referencc.~ to [he Shekhina, the female divine entity :lJready familiar to us fi"Om her appearances in the earlier Talmudic and Midrashic literarures. In the next chapter we shall discuss in detail dlis feminine divinity whosc favorite Kab· b.a.listic namc is "me Marronit," i.c., tile Matron. What we wish to consider here is mc question of thc relationship of thc Shckhina to God, and thc issue of polymeism vcrsus monotheism n:presented by it. The lcanx.-d. among the Kabbalists were undoubtedly aware of the problem, grappled with it, and succeeded in solving it in a manner satisfactory to them. One can imagine that by extraordinary mental eftarr they were able to remain unfail· ingly aware of the absolute oneness of God even while their imagination was assaulted by the most outspoken descriptions of passionate embraces between the male and female "elements" of the deity. But the learned were always few, while the ignorant and near+ignorant \I'cre many. The strength of Kabbalism la~' not in what it meant for the select few who were :lblc to devote a lifetime to it-" study, even as the intellectual elite of the anti-K:lbb:llists did to me smdv of the T:1lmud. The Kabbala's significance lay precisely in the great infillencl.' it exerred. from the 16th cenrury on, upon the many, the masses, for whom intensive srudy was om of thc question. If the most conspicuous idcas and teachings of Kabb:1lism nevcnheless reached them, it was by word of mouth and in greatly simplified fornl. To put it diffen::ntly, a simpler idea had a greater chann- of popular acceptance than a more difficult one. The belief in the Shekhina (or Matronit), the matronly, divine figure, who. in a way. functioned as an internlediary ben\'een me People of Israel and God, was a simple, easily comprehended idea. Since it "responded to a deep scated religious need," it won ready acceptance among wide circles in the Jewish communities everywhere. Much more difficult to understand was the complementary doctrine which maintained that God and tile Shekhina were one. Lip·service. to be sure, was paid by all to me time-honored orthodox Jewish concept of the Oneness of God. On the logical level, many were even able to assert that the Shekhina and the other clements (of which more below) discerned in God were merely symbols which helped in comprehending the mystery of His narure, or emanations issuing tarth from Him, but in no way affecting His fundamental Oneness. Yet on the deeper b 'el of emotion and imagination, the image of me



116 The Hebrew Goddess
wifdy and motherly, passionate and compassionatc female divinity met with immediate, sponta.ncous and positive response. Especially to popular imagination, thc Shekhina was no mere symbol. or emanation, but a great heavenly reality whose shining countenance shoved the theoretical doctrine of the Om:nc.<;s of God into the background. The deep emotional attachment of the simple, unsophisticated followers of the Kabbala to the Shekhina was comparable to the relationship of the Italian or SpaniSh villagers to their Madonna. In both cases it cannot be denied that one is faced with the veneration of a goddess, and it is impossible to dispure th:u she means more for the satisfaction ofdeep-seated rdigious emotional needs than God Him.sclf Numerous passages in the Zohar, whatever their possible interpretation as mystical speculations about God, struck a responsive chord in heartS yearning for a divine mother-inlage. Some of these passages deal with the tragic figure of the Matronit which we shall analyze in the next chapter. Others discuss the divine tetrad, the four major persons of the Zoharic godhead, and sc\'eral of these passages make it appear that the name Yahweh, composed of four letters, was the basis from which thc concept of me divine family of four was derived. \-Ve shall, therefore, tum next to that most ancient, most holy and forbidden name of God, the Tetragrammaton.
2 IThe T etragrammatoll
In the Bible, God is referred to by several names, such as El, Elohim, Shaddai, Yahweh, or a combination of these. In the Talmudic period, the mOSt frequently used name of God was "the Holy One, blessed be He." In [he Zohar and Kabbalistic literature in gencr:ll. God is still called "the Holy One, blessed be He," bur, in :lddition, scveral other mystical divine Il:lmes appear, which refer to God in rclation to various stages in the history of the uni\'ersc, or designate certain aspects of His being.
r
- The ancient Biblical Tetragramm:uon, Yahweh (YHWH ), is rc~rded
in the Kabbala as an abbre\~at~vmbol of four divine c1emen~ which
iJ. fonn part of the deity. The four dements are Hokhma (Wi:gioru). Blna
1..), (Understanding), T:fCT£t (Beauty) . and Malkhut (Kingship). M~er, \V'isdom is identified with the Father, Understanding with the Mother,
l
Beauty With the Son, and Kingsh~ with the Daughter. These fo ur divine concepts fonn the Kabbalistic tetrad. One passage in the Zohar, for instance, States that "the lener Y in me nanlC YHWH is called Father and srands for Wisdom; the first H is the Supemal Mother, called Understanding; and the Wand the second H arc the two children. a son and a daughter, who were crowned by their Mother.l



The Kabbalistic Tetrad 11 7
A related passage explains:
Wisdom spread om :l.nd brought forth Understanding. and they were found to be male and female, Wisdom the Father. and Understanding the Mother.... Then these tWO united, and lighted up each other, and the H [i.e., the Mother] conceived and g:m: birth to a Son. Through the birth of the Son the Father :md the Mother found their perfection [tiqqun], and this lc.-d to the completion of e\'erything, the inclusion of c\'crything: Father, Mother, Son :lOd D3ugher.·
In yet another Zohari, passage morc dCflils arc gl\'cn about the origin of this dh'inc (amil\,:
The Y brought forth a rivcr which issued from the Garden of Eden and was identical with the Morner. The Mother became pregnant
with the two children. m{' W who was the Son, and the st1:ond H who was the daughter, and she brought them forth and suckled them.... Thel>C twO children are under the tutelage of the Famer and the Mother.... After the Mother gave birth [0 me Son. she placed him before her. and this is why the firsr H in me name YH\VH must be writt<.il close together \\;m the W The Son rccci\'(.-d a double share of inheritance from his Father and Mother, and he. in rum, nourished dle Daughter. This is why when writing me Tetragranunaton in sacred teens, one must bring me Wand the second H elose together.5
In spite of the c);"plicimcss ofmcsc passages. which is matched and C\'cn surpassed by many others to be dealt \Vim further on. all thc modcm stu· dents of me Kabbala interpret mem as nothing morc than mystical sym· bolism.'" They argue that it is in the narure of me Kabbalistic srylc to speak of 3SJX-ctS or emanations of the One God as if they were independent entities. Since God is known to be wisc, they speak of His Wisdom: since He is possessed of understanding. they speak of His Understanding. etc.• and to further clarify these anributes. they designate them as Father. Mother. Son. and Daughter. Two considerations render this interpretation unsatisfactory. One is the "slippage" phenomenon referred to above, which can be obscr.ed in many Kabbalistic elaborations of the four "elements" in me dcit),. dealing with their affairs and vieissirudcs. the relationships between them and their reac· tions to one another.

The other consideration which \'iti:ucs rhe mystical symbolic interpretation of the Kabbalisnc tetrad is the existence of numerous divine tetrads in other religions with occasional surprising similarities between the myths told abom them and the statements made about the four -clcments~ of God in Kabbalisric litcrarun:. This not onl~' renders it unlikely mar wh:u rhe Kabb:lla has to sa~' about the tetrad was engendered merely by mystical srmbolisrn. but m:tkt:s us suspect that the K:lbb31istic myths about the [('r[::ad reflect outside. nonJewish influences. A rapid survey of polytheistic tetrad myths is here called for to substantiate this assumption.
31AnC£mt Tetrads
Tetrads. although nor as common as triads, arc found in SC\'Cl'aJ relgious rulrurcs of antiquity. The earliest known group of four related gods is that of ancient Egyptian religion. The father-god, Shu, we read in early Egyptian mythological texts, was the :tir that carried the sky. His female counterpan was Tefnut. goddess of moisture. Their union produced a son Geb. or Earth, and a daughter Nut. or Sky. Geb and Nut were united in tight marital embrace. until Father Shu separated them by raising the sky lip from the bosom of the canh.- (Sec Plate 29. ) On.ly somewhat younger is the tetrad myth of the Sumerians. the old, non· Semitic inhabitmts of Mesopotamia. The pn."'Cisc famil~' relationshIps of the gods of the Sumerim pamhcon is obscure. and in most cases linle is known about which god was whose son, husband. f:lthcr or brother. and which goddess was whose daughter, wife, mother or sister. Nevcnhdess. it has become dear, primarily thanks to the indefatigable srudics of Samuel N, Kramer. that there was :l close, first-degree relationship between a group of four gods who were in comrol of hea\'cn. earth. sea, and air. and who. among thcm, created all the other cosmIC emities.' The four were the god of Heaven, An; the great mother goddess Ninhufsag: the god of water. Enki; and the god of air, Enli!. That they were a clearly defined tetrad is evident not only from their position of primary creator gods. but also from their continued imponance after the emergence of me ocher gods.

(Sec Plate 30.) In the: andent Canaanite pamhl..'Oll itself the four gods E1, Ashcrab, Baal. and An:uh stand out aillong all the other gods as a dearly recognizable di"inc family. Thanks to the major archaeological discO\"cry of the Ugariric tablets at Ras Shamra. ncar the northeastern comer of the Mediterranean, we have an cxccptionalJy complete picture of the mythological world of the northern Canaanites in the 14th ccnrury H.C.E.

In Gn.-ek mythology. Cronus, RhC:J.. u..-us and Hcra so.."Jll to have formed the original di\'inc.~ tetrad. Cronus and Rhea were brother and sister as well as husband :md wife. After casrrating his father Uranus (""Sky"), Cronus ruled in his stead. until he. in rum, was castrated and dethroned by his own son, Zeus, who then became King of the gods. and god of the sky and of thunder. The wife of Zeus was Hera, hb sister. goddess of the eanh. fecundity. marriage. and women. and worshipc..xl as Maid, Wife. and Widow. The Roman equivalent of this tetrad was that of Sarum. Ops, Jupiter (JQ\·e). and Juno. Juno's eldest and most common name was Juno Lueina. or Lucena. referring to her original light-nature. In her capacity as the goddess of marriage. she was also known as Matrona. a name which. of course. reminds us of the Kabbalisnc name of the daughter-goddess. the Marronir. who will be the subject of the ncxt chapter.

The K::tbbalistic Tetrad 123
4 J The Father and the M other
We arc now ready to rum to the testimony of the Kabbalistic litcrature itself. and to review those passages which give c,idencc of "slippage" from the symbolic into the m~rthological realm. These passages contain numerous accounts of episodcs in the life of the di\'ine Father, Mother, Son, and Daughter, which in their swn toral amount to vcritable biographies. As we shall 5(."c, so many of these episodes arc clearly mythological that in the facc of their cumulati"e evidence the contention that all this is merely mystical symbolism and speculation about the «aspccrs,~ or ~ema nations,~ or e\'en ""dements" of a o ne and only God, must appear as pious fiction. The four entitles of the godhead in these passages function as independent persons who address, converse with, 3ct upon and react to. each other. M OfcrnW, the deeds they pcrfonn, the c..xpcrienccs the}' undergo. and the feelings they display 3re 311 well couched in unmistakably mythological terms, strikingly similar to the tCfrad m~1:hs sketched abo\"e. To begin with, let us fl·fer again to the fact that the explanation of the four consonants of the Tt-rragn.mmaron is gi\"en in sexual·familial terms. The four letters, as we have seen. arc not onl" stated to svmboli7..c (or ~'t3nd for) \\rLSdom. Understanding, Ikaury, and Kingship (which in themselvcs could be understood as purely conceptual attributes of God), but are also identified with Father, Mother, Son, and Daughter. respccti\'eI~·. In addition• .1S we han: likewise seen. reference is made to the manner. purely sexual. in which these divine componentS (or may we 31ready be p(.'rmitt{.-d to call them "'pcrsons"~ ) originated: the Father brought forth the Mother, then copulated with her, and thus the Son and the: Daughter were oom. The: rdationship tx:tween the Father and the Mother is discussed in numerous other passages as well. of which a few arc presented here: "'Never docs the inclination of the Father and the Mother toward each otMr cease. They always go out together and dwell togcrher. Th{.~' nC\'er separate md never lea\"e each other. They are together in complete union.'· 14 We ha\"c seen abo\"e mat this mythological motif (or " m~rthologcm" ) is contained in the Egyptian m~rth ofGcb and Nut, and the Hindu myth of Shi\'3 and Parvati. Here we may add that the m~rthologem of the World Parents, of the Sky-futhe:r and Earth-mother as the progenitors of the univcrse, of their clinging together in a pcnnment embrace, of me timeless bliss they enjoy in their complete md ce:asclcss union, is quite common all o\"er du: world,zs which in itself rendcrs it most unlikely that the author of the Z-ohar happened by coincidence to hit upon the same idea simply on the basis of his m~lstiC3l speculations :tbout the meaning of the first two consonants of the Tetragrammaron.



124 The Hebrew Goddess
In another Zohanc passage. the sexual union of the Father and the l\tother (h<..tt n.1em.'d to as ~Tzaddiq." i.e.. RightCOll'i One. and his "Female") is described in unflinching phrsiolcgical detail:
When [he st.ocd of the Righteous is about (0 be ejaculated. he doc!> not have to seek the Ft'malc, for !>he abidc~ widl him, never Ica\'es him, and IS always in readin($S for him. His .seed flows not saxe: when the Female is rt'ady, and when mey both as one desire eaeh other; and they unite in a single: embrace, and never separatc.. Thus the Righteous is ne\'er foresaken. :>to
The unceasing Ion: berween me Father and the Mother, and its tangible expression, their pemunem union. earned them the name "Companions" ( rt"im ):
The Famer and the Mother, since tht'Yarc fowld ill WUOIl all the time and arc rK"\'Cf hidden or separated from C3ch other, an: called ~Com panions." ... And tht'Y find satisfuction in PCrmaJK'Ilt union....2~
The Supreme Mother IS called wCompanion~ (m 'a,va ). because the love of the Father never departs from ht'f. 2~ The marital embrace of the father-g.od and the mother-goddess is so right and so permanent that the n\'o give the impression of ont" body, androgynous in narure, like Zunan in ancient Iranian mythology, The emergence of this idea in Jewish mysticism can be traced back to Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla ( 1248- 1305). whose writings influenced the author of the Zohar and who, reciprocally, was influenced by thc Zohar. 29 In fact, Gikatilla wamed against thc belief, held by comemporary or c:'lrlier Kabbalists. that thc deity actually had the physical fonn of an androgyne:
He woo wld('T~..tands this nwstcrv will understand all mc MMnbuthMl
and all the Grades of Ema;13ti~n which take me shape of rcrei\'cr and influencer. And this is the mystery of the androgyneY Not as if there was there me actual shape of an androgyne. God forbid that one should believc such a thing and broadcast such a
calumny. .. , [But1each Grade of all the Gf3des of YHWH, blessed be He. has two faces. Onc face which recciycs from the one abOl:e it. and a second face which emits good to the one beneath it, until it rcachl.."S the na\·el of the earth. Thus, each Gr:lde has twO aspects. :'l [feminine] power of receiving ... and a lmasculinc] power of emanating ... and in this manner the MtTkaborh arc called androgyne.. .. This is a great mystery among the mysteries of the Cherubim, and the mystery of the shape of the Merkaba..J~



The Kabbalistic Tetrad 125
In the sequel the author makes it clear that, when speaking. of the androgynous ehar.lCfer of dle godhead. he has in mind a double body joined back to back, with tWO front sides looking in opposite directions-the
classical, Midrashic concept of the androgyne.u In spite of Gikatilla's warning. however, the Kabbalistic tendency to discern a m:tle and female element in the deil1' could nor be suppressed, In fact. it remained an established doctrine that God consisted of male and female components. Thus we read in the Zohar:
The Female [component of the godhead Jspread out from her place and adhered to the Male side, until he moved awOl" from his side. and she came to unite with him face to face. And when they unitoo. they appeared as veritably one Ixxfy. From this we learn that the male alone appears as half a body ... and the female likewise. but whcn they join in union they seem as veritably one !:xxiy." .10n the Sabbath) all is found in one Ixxfy. complete. for the Matronit clings to the King and they be<ome one Ixxfy. and this is why blessings arc found on that day..M
Moses Cordowro (1522-1570). the inRuential Safed (Palestine) Kabbalist, expatiates on the subject repcatedl~' in his Pardes Rimrm:mim ("The
Ibmcgranate Orchard~), which he completed in 1549. Typical of his approach is the following. comment on thc highest of the ten Di"ine Emanations. or Sefirot, e:tlled Crown: "The Cro"'" itself is comprised of Male and Female. for one pan of it is Male. the other Female... ?'.!S The view that the dcil1' is androgynous or hermaphroditic in nature, if not in form, must ha\'e existed sc\'eral centuries prior to its first explicit mention by Gikatilla. For we rcad in an early Midrash that ""Vhen the Holy One, blessed be He. created man, He created him as an adrogyne."J(> Since it was a pivotal doctrine in Hebrew religion that God creatc.--d man in his own image,J7 the statement that man was first ereated in an androgynous shape must have meant that the deity tOO was imagined as hermaphroditic. This. however. is merely our inference; in no Midrash is there e\'en as much as a reference or an allusion to the hermaphroditic nature of God. In Kabbalistic litcrarure, beginning with the Zohar. on the other hand, with itS penchant for sexualizing the entire spiritual world. the dOCTrine of the male and the female aspects of the godhead had become commonplace, and almost inevitably crystalli7.cd into the concept of the androgynous deity. But to return to the mythical biography of the divine parents. as a rc:sult of the enduring marital embr:1ce. the Supernal Mother became preg· nant (again like Zurvan in Iranian mythology) and gavc binh to a Son and a Daughter:



126 TIle Hebrew Goddess
The Supernal H (i.e., the Mother] b<,'C:Ulle pregnant:iS a result of all the love and fondling - since the Y ne\'er lcaH:s hcr- and she brought forth the W [the Son], whereupon she stood up and suck·
led him. And whcn the \V emerged, his female mate Ithe D;1Ughtcr, repn.:sented by the $Ccond H in the Tetragr:l.mmaton } emerged together with him.J.II
The twin birth of the Son and the Daughter took place, according to another version, in the fornl of the birth of a single bur androgynous bcmg. In other words, the second generation of the godhead duplicated m its original shape that of thc first. The passage containing this idea combmcs dlcogony with cosmogony by rcferring to the Son as "Hea\'en~ and to the D.lugh[~:r as '"Earth.,: ~Undcrst:ulding [i.e., Supernal Mother] broughl forth Earth [i.e., the Daughter ], but the latter \\'35 contained in He3\'Cn [i. e.. the
Son J, and they emerged together, joined together back to back....~ Then Heaven look Earth and set her in her proper plan...
and when Earth turned to dwell in her pl:tce and became separ:lfed from the back of Hca\'en, she was confused and wished to adherc again to Hea\'en as in the beginning, because she saw thaI Hea\'en was bright wrule she was dark, BUI then Supernal Light pourcrt forth, illuminating her, and she returned to her pl:tce to gazc 3t He3vcn f3ce to f3ee, whereupon E:mh W3S established 3nd beeanle jo~ful .J<I
This paSS3ge is significant not only mythologically but also cosmogon· ically. It states, as do the mythic3l cosmogonies of so many peoples. th:t! the sexual union betwccn the Father-god and the Mother·goddess rcsulted in [he birth of Heaven and Earth. At first, Heaven carried Earth upon his back; then he scpar3ted from her and pl:lced her beneath and opposite himself. Earth, d3rk and desolate. tried to reunite with Heaven in the fonner position. But Heaven fUmed his radiance upon her, and. basking in the lighr refl.ected from Heaven, Earth \\'as contt::nr with her pl:tce below. which she has occupied e\'er since. 111e basic simil:tritics octwc.:en thi:. cosmogonic ffi\'th and those of other ancient culfUres are obVIOUS. Let us now look 3t the rd:ttionship of the parennl couple: of the tetrad to their children. Tht: Father and the Mother lo\'ed dleir children t:xcec.:d· ingl~r. adorned their heads with many crowns. and showered them with 3 flood of blessings 3nd riches. Howen:r. the F:tther loved the D3ughtcr more. while: the Mother's favorite W3S the Son. In fact, the Father's love tor his Daughter knew no bounds.

we know the classical example after which me passage was fashioned. It is contained in :;I Midrash on the Song of Songs in which the 10'.' of God for ISr:ld is m:a.de rmgiblc by comparing it to the overpowering love :l. King fel! for his only daughter. In his boundless loyc, the King was not satisfied to call his daugher "my daugher," but addressed her as "my sister" md even "my mother." •.o\nd, this is ex:a.crly how God addrcSSt.-d his beloved. Israel. the Midrash statt!S and proceeds to illusrran: its proposition by citing Biblical ~ges.tl
It IS on this Midrash that the author of thc Zohar based his myth of the exceeding 1o\'C of God the Father for his daughter. the Matronit, using the identical tcrn1S of ende:a.rn1t':nt. There can be link doubt that JUSt as in the 1lidrash the king md his daughter, standing for God and Israel, are tWO separate persons. so in the Zoharie m~m the tWO di\·ine figures of the Father and the Daughter were also conceived as discrete and independent personages. The jl.."aJousy of the Mother was added by Moses de Leon to the Midrashic prototype of this myth, based probably on his familiarity \lith similar motifs in other mythologies. As for the divine Mother's 100'e for her Son, she expressed it by holding him against her breast md gi\'ing suck to him, and continuing to do so eyen after he grew up and was ready to marry:
As long as Israel is found with thc Holy One. blessed be He [i.c., the Son], Hc, so to speak, is in a stare of completeness. and He nourishes himself aplenty by sucking thc milk of the Supernal Mother. . . . ~ J
Only when the Matronit (i.e .• the Daughter) was separated from the King (i.e.• the Son) did "the Supernal Mother. too. remove herself from the King :l.nd CC':l.SC to sucklc him. " ... The Mother·goddess sllckling her son (or sons) is. as we ha\'e seen, a m~thologcm fn."qucntly recurring in accounts of ancient tetrads.

In many mythologies, the older of the tWO couples which fonn the tetrad withdraws 3t an carly juncmrc to a remote position and leaves most of th" troublesome dealings with mankind to the younger divine pair. Because of this. most of the myths telling about the lives afme gods focus not on the parent deities. but on their children, the tWO younger gods. This is certainly the case in scven out of the nine tetrads sketched above, and fhis is what we find in the lohanc myrhology as well. The passages dealing with tht, Father and the Mother. or dwelling on the relationship ocm'cell them and their Son and Daughter. arc rclanivdy short texts, reiterating or alluding to a n:ry few (\"cilts. In COntrast. the passages concerning the Son and the Daughter stretch into kngthy narran\·cs. dCSoCribing in derail dK: relationship between them, and !:Specially me tragic phase of meir tempestuOUS love affair, their separation which came about with the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem and me c:xile of the people of Israel. An analysis of mis material will Ix contained in the next chapter. But a summary of those features which bear direct1~· upon the Kabbalistic tetrad belongs to the present context. The tcnninology itself is compk-x and confusing. The Son is called ..the: K.ing,~ "the Holy One, blessed be He," Zoharariel (meaning "Splendor of Arid," Ariel }x-ing a name of me altar, and itself meaning "Lion of ElM), Adiryaron ('"'The Mighty Om: Sings~) .AJ;.tarici (MMy Crown is En, Tctrasia (MFollr God,~ referring to the:- Tetragrammaton, or to God as the ruler of the tour clements, air, earth, water, and firc ) ,~5 as well as '"'Hea\'ell.~ as we have seen above. His Slster-\\'ifc, me divinc Dallghtt.T, has even more nanlCS: Malkhut (MKingshlp," the name of me tenth Sefin), Shekhina ("Dwc:Uing"),Matronit (.\tarron or Lady), "Pearl" (or '"Prl..-cious Stone'"'), "Discardl.-d Cornerstone,....., as well as the "Communit)' of Israel," MFemalc," "'Moon," '"'Han;" MEarth," "Night;' "Gardcn," "Well," '"'Sea," "The Supernal Woman," '"'The Light Woman." According to Joseph Gikatilla. "in the days of Abraham the Shekhina was called Sarah; in the days of Isaac - Rebekah; and me days of Jacob- Rachcl."~
The Son and Daughter, or, as we shall refer to them from now 011, the King and rhe Matronit, were destined to marry, like many a brorher and sister in divine families. \-Vhen meir marriage took place is nor stated. but it seems that it could not be cdcbrated until Solomon had built the Tempk in Jerusalcm. which W3S to scn'e 3S [heir wedding chamber and thercaftcr as their bedroom.



The Kabbalistic Tetrad 129
The problem of incest in\'Dlved in me marriage of the King and the Matronit arose but did not bother the Kabbalists. Their view was that under ideal circumstances. which, of course, prc."3iI in heaven, all unions arc permined. because "'Above on high there is neither incest, nor clIning off, nor scpar:1Don. nor keeping 3pan; thercfon:. aba.'C on high mCl'"C is wUoo bcrwc:cn brother and sister. and son and daughtcr."43 Whik the 10\'(' octween me King and the: Matronit was thus licit. it was vcry differem in character from th:lr beTween their parents. Where the stcady. solid 10\'(' of the cider couple eamed them the n:unc "'Companions:' the Ion: affair of the King and the Marronit was marked by quarrels, temporary separations. and tempestuous reunions, so that the pair was properly merred to as "'Io...c~'" (dodim ). The reason for many of the difficulties besetting the King and the Matronit was that she became closely associated with the People of Isrncl (this is why she was often refem.:d [0 by the name "'Community of Israel," Kncsscth Yisrncl). Hence, when the P(."Qpic of Israel sinned, this resulted in a stparntion between God, the King, and his wife, the Marronit. The visible expression of mcir separtion was the destruction of the Temple, their bedroom. JO\uible, but no less painfuUy felt. was the consequent impainnent of thl..· King's }X>wer, an idea reminiscent of the notion of Hindu mythology that the male god (Shi\'a) is powerful only when united with the goddess (Shakti ), but is unable evcn to stir without her.49 As expressed repeatedly in Kabbalisric theosophy: "The King [i.e.. Goo] y,ithout the Matronir is not a king, is not great, and is not praised... :'>0 Therefore, me scparation of the King and the Matronit was a calamity for both the people of Israel and the godhead itself. In other mythologies. as well as in the Zohar. it is a commonplace [hat d.i\ine actS influence the fate of men. The re\'crsc of this idea, that human deeds have a spontaneous, almost aUtomatic effect on the fu te of the gods, is not, as far as is known to me, a part of pagan mythologies. But precisely this idea pla~'s an important role in Kabbalistic mythology. Two examples, expressing at me same rime thc close analogy octween the marriage of man and woman and that of the King and the Marronit. will suffice:
The groom and the bride, as soon as they reccive the scycn blessings undet the wcdding canopy, occome united following the Supernal example. And therefore. he who conmlits adultery with another's wife damages the union and. as it were. causes a separation on high intO two :mthoritics. Because the union of the ConmlUnity of Israel {i.e., the Matronit] is only with the Holy One, blessed Ix: He (i.e"

Th:u is to say. an adulterer. who causes separation between a man and his wife, wreaks grave danlage in heaYC;ll 2.lso. by causing separation between [he divine couple. The second c."I:ampk is a passage which expresses the idea that a man is suppost~d to practice imitatio dd by marrying and begetting a son and daughter, thus reproducing. in flesh and blood, the divine rctr.1d; and that, by failing to do so. he ~diminishes the imagc'" of God. c:lUsing scp3r.ltion between members of the di\'ine retrad:
When is a man called complete in his resemblance to the Supernal? When he coupk"S with his spouse in oneness, joy, and pleasure, and a son and a daughter issue from him and his female. This is the complete man resembling the Above: he is complete below after the pattern of the Supernal Holy ~amc. and the Supernal Holy l\!3me is :tpplied to him .... A man who docs not want [ 0 compkte the Holy l':ame below in this manner, i[ were better tor him that he were not created. becausc he has no pan at all in the Holy Name.

61The Tetrad as Myth
The abo\'e walecta will ha\"e to suffice at this mge of our cffons to piece togcther a mythological biography of the divi;e tetrad of the Kabbala. That we han~ to do here with polytheistic myths or, at least, m~'th fragmcnu cannot be doubted. But if so, it rem:tins now to gi\'e consideration to the question of the meaning of thcse myth fragments for the author of the Zohar (and of the other Kabbalistic treatises quoted), wd for the followers of thc Kabbala, the m'ql/bbaJim , who believed in ;l.Ild were dl..·eply influenced by these wrirings and doctrines. Two problems :tt once become apparent. One is that the Kabbala·believing Jews. no less than their co-rciigionislS who disapproved of the Kabbala, were strict monotheists. Thc tenet that there is only One God was equally axiomatic for both groups. Any question as to the possible polytheistic meaning of the passages qUOfC.-d above would undoubtedly have met with the most vehcment and indignant denial on the part of the Kabbalists, although their opponents were wont to accuse them of precisely such pillralistie hercsicsY To the bclicver~, howevcr. the

If it was pointed out to them that this or that passage in the Zohar smacked of polytheistic heresy, their answer was ready: what might seem heresy in a passage was not its tnl& meaning. which could be understood only by inmlersing oneself in the -mysterics~ (rliZitl) of the hidden truths. To their thought processes. inured to and conditioned by rums of c-xpressian such as "this means,'" ~as if,'" "as it wert'.'" and the like. with which every page of tht· Zoh3r is replete, any passage. even one speaking quite clearly of two or four deities. would appear to bc referring [Q the One God in His various asP"cts, the \'Cry exist!..'lCe of which was one of the greatest "'mysteries:" While such must ha\·e bcen the conscious and habirual mental processes ....flich made the Zohane doctrine of the tetrad unexceptionable to the Kabb:l.lisfS. th:l.t doctrine struck :l. different chord in the subconscious realm ofemotional response. Man everywhere fashions his gods in his own image. and familism was. :l.nd has ren13ined until quite recently. a most important ooor. if not the central one. III the socia-psychological image of the Jew. The Jew could not im3gine a Jewish life without the family. nor one not centered around the family. The lone. aloof God. :l.dored by the Jews lip to the time of the Kabbalistic upsurge, could not satis~.' the emotional craving which sought a reflection of earthly life in the hea\Tnly realm. The lone. aloof God, even if cast in the image of the futhcr, ewn if surrounded. by :l.ll his hC3\'enly hosts, the angels and 3rch:mgds. functioning 3S the heavenly patrons of the dements of which narure and mankind were composed.

In this case, we must :tIso assume that the similantlcs hem cen these uwenrions and the details cont:1incd in the mythologies of other religions :1bout their respective u:fr:lds wcrc d~ to ~hl't"r coincidence. BUI this is highly unlikely. if nor Impossible, because the similaritic. art' tOO numerous, tOO detailed. and too complex.

and reflected in, the thinking of Moses de Leon. A knowledge of Indian theosophy could haw rcached 13-ccnrury Spain, just as knowledge of Yoga practices, through the intennediacy of the Ar:J.bs. As we have secn, it so happens that the Zohar's tetrad shows grc3U"r simibrity to the Indian than to any other tetrad . The idea that, if not lUlited with the goddess, the God is powerless. found in almost identical phrasing in both the Zohat and Indian mythology, is an especially striking instance. But if Moses de Leon knew of "pagan" divine fi.'trads , did he consciously include the idea in his Zohat? To answer in the affinnatin: would be tantamount to charging him with willful propagation of idolatrous heresies, and I do nor believe this was the case. The idea that the Godhead was androgynous by nature was a thcosophic doctrinc latellt in Judaism for many cenrurics. As we saw above, Philo of Alexandria discerned a male and a female element in the dein' as earlv as the Ist century C.E. Thus
..
when Moses de Leon cam(' to explain the "hiddcn mcaning" and the "rrue significance'" of the Tctragranmlaton, he followed old, if indistinct, paths interpreting its first two letters (YH, which in themselves arc a shalt form of the name of God) as referring to the male and female clements in God, identified as Wisdom and Understanding. When speculating about the third and fouM letters, his thinking was influenced by what he knew and remembered of the "pagan", terT3.ds, 3.nd possibly in the first place of the Indian one. The third and fouM k·tters became identified in Dc Leon's mind with the mystical offspring of the original di\,ine couple. Had he tollO\vt·d the Indian example, he would have made both children males . But the tourth letter of the Terragrammaton was an H. like the second one; therefore it, too, had to stand for a female divinity. Thus a son and a daughter \\'ere made to form p3.rtS of the dcity. Once the four mysric:l.1 :l.SpeL1:S of the deity were deline:l.ted, funher speculation as to their nature and interrelationships led to that inadvenent slippage referred to in the beginning of this chapter. Probably witham being aware of his mental processes, De Leon referred again and again to the four aspects of the godhead bridlr for the most pan, but with docrcasing restraint, as if they were separate persons. Before long, he felt 110 hesitation in attributing to the four persons interrelationships and fedings which made sense only if one regarded them as four separate gods_ very human in their behav· ior, emotions, and reactions. In supplying details, De u:on again drew upon his familiarity with other rerrads, whether conseiouslr or otherwise. His cognitive process must ha\'c been similar to that of the prophets and poets of the Hebrew Bible who used phrases in praise of God and attributed deeds to Him which had been applied, in exactly the same terms, to the pagan gods Baal and Bull-El by their Canaanite predecessor. 56 As is well



134 The Hebrew Goddess
known, in the old days quite a few polytheistic references did in this manner slip into the Biblical image of God. and this is prcsumably what happ<.'ned again n\'Q millennia later. in the case of Moses de Leon. To sum up: On the conscious level. Dc Leon spoke of four aspects of tht, Godhead. and this is wh:u his thcosophic teachings were raken to mean by the c.."''Cfwidc..ning circk of Kabbalisrs. Bur. in his cndc.."3vur to give trnpharic. "h·id expression to his idcas. he ft:SOrrcd [0 a rich array of m~'{hological and sexual imagery. The features of this imagery grew OUt of Dc Leon's familiarit), with Indian and other pagan tetrads. Without being aware of what he was doing, in speaking of the marriage of the Fuhcr :md the Mothe:r, the subsequent binh of their Son and Daughter. the emergence out of the Mother's womb of the androgynous Heaven-and-Earth. their separ:ltion. the 100'e of the Father for the Daughter, the jealousy of the Morher. the suckling of rhe King (the Son) and the Matronit (the Daughter). etc., he comJX>scd a tetradic myth cycle. He set out to establish a doctrine of quatrinity, of the Divine condition of being fourfold. and ended up with the myth of a tetrad. a group of four separate and independcnt deitics. If the author. me m:l.Ster himself: W:lS unaware of all this and km.-wonly of the mystical s~mbolism of the Godhead's four :J.Spt""Cts which his teachings PU'lX"JrtL"<i to explore. one need link wonder that his followers felt no qualm~ in accepting his docTrincs. They Imnv imellectUally th:\( whatever tht:y read in me Zohar about the Far:hcr. Morhcr, Son, and D:mghu.'l' referred, in its mle meaning. to the four aspects of the one G(xihc:ad. Yer, ar rhe same time. they rcsJX>nded emotionally not to tht" "true" meaning and purJX>rt of the statements, but to what the words actUally said. Such simultm<."Ous response on two lC\'els is not an infrequent phenomenon. The Kabbalists not only gained insight into the mythical nature of the Godhead from Zoharic accounts. bur also derived a quasi sensuous emotional satisfaction from learning about the sexual and familial life of the di\'inc retrad. which gave mythicaJ sanction to me corresponding aspeCts of their own life on earth, And_ although rhis second-level rcsponse remaint"<i subconscious. it W:lS in large measure due to it thar the Zohar. and with it Kabbalism. achieved such remarkable popularity in Judaism,

MATRONIT
THE GODDESS OF THE KABBALA
Let us now rum OUf ;mcntion to the founh person of the KabbaJisric retrad. the Daughter. who. in addition to the old Talmudic name of
Shckhina, is rcfcm__d fa in J(-',\15h mysricallitcrarurc by a pro~ion of narnes, epithcrs and appellativcs. but most fn.:qucntly by the Latin loan word MlIlronita, that is -the Marronit," or the Matron. Of the four persons of the Kabbalistic tetrad it is she who plays the greatest role as the central figure in both divine happenings and relationships, and the occurrences through which human fate, and in particular the fare of israel, is propdlcd fOf'\\'3fd. She is the ((nrra! link between the Above and the Below. She is
me person through whom man can most easily grasp the Ineffable mystery
of the dcirv, and who moSt fulh· identifies herself with the interests. the joys. and the W()(:S. of ISr.l.d. She 'is unquestionably the moSt poignant. and 31 the same time most Jewish, expression of the idea of a goddess" Yet, and mis is a striking example of perhaps the moSt f:lscinating facet
of thc his[Of"\' of religious :tnd nwthieal ideas, mere is a detaikd similarirv
between mc "life his[~ry, Char:lCfe~. deeds :tnd feelings anributed by Jewish mysticism to me M:ltromt. and what ancient Near Eastern mythologies !u\"C to say about their goddcsse~ who occupy positions in their pamh('Olls"

136 The Hebrew Goddess
In myths, epics. naIT3ri\cs, and "isual rcprcscnlJ.[ions mcst' anClcnt Scar E~tcrn goddesses 3fC described and depicted in dear. realistIC, down-tocanh colors. without the \'ciling effect the mystical approach of the Kabbab has on its goddess n!;urc. A glance at them will, therefore, materially aid our understanding and characterization of the goddess of the Kabbala.. the Matronir.
1 17'1" Goddess ojLuve alld War
Three or four examplcs will h3\'C to suffice to introduce to us the goddess who pl3yed a central role: in the religious ritual as well as popular consciousness of all Ancient ;:-.;rear Eastern tx"Opk. Her name \'ancd from culture to culture-Inanna in Sumcr. lshtar in Akkad. Anam in Cmaan
\'et her character rcmaUled the same for centuries. (YCfl millennia. The lift domains in which she primarily manifested herself were love and war, and her personality exhibited everywhere the ~lC four basic trans of chasril)' and promiscuity, motherliness and blcxxhhirstiness. The oldest of them was Inanna.. the great Sumerian goddess of k:7.-c and war. the rutelary deity ofUruk (the Biblical Ercch), whose promlI\ence in the Sumerian pantheon was well established by the 3rd millenniUm BeE. That she was regarded a \'Irgin is e,idem from the twO epLthcu whICh accompany her name: in myths and othlT tcxts she is moSt frequently called ""the maid Inarma" and "the pure Inanna." Yet throughour Sumcnan history she was the goddess primarily responsible for sc:mal 1Q\·c. procreation, and fertility, who freel\" l!;a,·e herself to Ownuzi (Tammuzl.. the earliest m\"tbo·
logicai ruler of Su~~r, and thereafter becunc the wife of all Sumerian kings.. Nor was she immunc to the ad'·ances ofordinary momis: an old Sumerian Story rells of a gardener who one night managed (Q take advantage of Inarma's utter weariness and had intcrcourse with hcr. Upon awaking in the morning, Inanna was enr3ged over the indignity. and the vcngeance she wrought St..-cms to us to have surpassed all rc:ason. But her bdla\'ior was in keeping with hcr ch:nactcr. for she was a goddess of boundless rage and ruthless destruction. "the lady of barrie and conRict.- who had "great fury in hcr wr3thful heart." It was she who amled King Hammuf"3.bi (ca. 17281686 8 c.. E.) with might)' weapons. and was his -gracious protecting genius." More tharl a thousand yt'ars latC!". in tht' days of Nabonidus (555-539 BCe.). she was still worshipped at Uruk in a gold-dad cella. driving a chariot to which wt'rt' hamcsscd St'\'cn lions. 1
The direct hcir of In3.llna in Mcsopoc::amia was Ishtar. the great goddm oflQ\'c and war in thc Akkadian pantheon. The identity ofthe tWO IS attested



Marfonir 137
bv the fact that in some Akkadian texts me tWO names arc used interch:mgeably. (n the Babylonian lsht:rr, howc\'er. a certain shift occurred in the balance between the \irginal and promiscuous poles of her ch:J.r:J.(.:ter: her virginal aspect was underplayed, while her promiscuity was emphasized to the extent of making her a divine harlot. In many texts Ishtar is spoken of as the "Cow of the Moon-God Sin," and in this capacity she mkd over the plants. w:J.ten:d them and made them grow. An incantation for childbirth tells of this "Cow of Sin~ that she was impregnated by a "restless young bull,- and had great difficulty in bearing her young, until two genii of he:J.\'en helped hcr. In her human form, hn love easily turned to hate: she first loved then destroyed, a long line of divine, human, and animal paramours, including a lion. a horse. a bird, a g:J.rdener, scveral shepherds, the hero Gilgamcsh, Tammuz., etc. She also was the wife of human kings, such as Sargon of Agade. Her influence extended o\'er all mankind and me entire animal kingdom: when she entered me Nether World, neither man nor beast copulated; when she emerged. all of mem were again seized b~' sc:\."1JaI desire. Bur she was also me mother of the country, who said of herself. '"'It is I myself who ga\'e birth to m~' people,'" and the mother of 5e\'('ral gods anlOng whom me Fire-god was the first bom. One of her titles was '"'swcet-\'oiced mistress of the gods.'" Yet she was also "'the mOst awesome of the goddesses," "Ishtar of the b:ntkfidd,'" clad in divine firc,carrying the mdammu·headwe:J.r, who would r:lin fin' on the enemies. It was she \\"ho ga\'e victory to her lovers, the Babyloni:m kings, entnlsting her mighty anned force.." to them. Among all the artS of war she was specially interested in charioteering: in the carly stages of her career she [fied to win the lo\'e of Gilgamesh by promising him "a chariot of lapis and gold," and man: than a millennium later. in the Ptolemaic period. she was stili known as "mistress of Horses, lady of the chartiot." \Vhen not engaged in lo\'e or war
she was sitting, awe-inspiri.ngly. on her lion-throne.z 111e Canaanite A.nath, with whosc exploits we ha\'e become acquainred aOO\'e in Chapter II, is so dose In character and anributes to Inanna and Ishtar that she must be considered as merdv the wcstem variant of the great Mcsopotami:ln goddess. The Persian counterpan of the great \·irginal·wanton-motherly-warrior goddess was Anahita. Although the phonmlic fCS(.illbl:mce oc·tV.(."(..'l "Anath'" and "Anahita" is purdy coincidental. the worship of Anath mar havc spre:J.d as carl\' as the 1st millennium R.C.E. from the Mediterranean shore as f:lr cast a; the upper reaches of Euphrates. as indicated by the name of an Assyrian township, Anat (today Ana), :1 few miles lower down the river from Dura Europos. The worship of Anahit:l., Herodoms informs us (in a passage in which he makes the curious mistake of writing "Mjthra" instead



138 111c Hebrew Goddess
of~Anahita" ) , was learned b~' the Persims from the Assyrians. Other Greek authors state that the cult of Anaitis (as they referred to Anahita) corresponded in e\'ery respect to the Babylonim cult of lshtar. and that the representations of Anains were shaped after those of lshtar. In the Avest3, the sacn.-d wrirings which mcicnr Iran..i:m tradition attributes to Zoroaster (who probably lived in the 10th ccnrury H.CE.) but which did not assume their extant foml until the early Sassaniall period {3rd-4th cenruries CE.),:m entire chapter (Yasht \,) is de\uted to her. Her full name was Ard\'i Sura Anahita, or "'The High, Fbwcrful. Inunaeuiate," and she is described as ~a beautiful maiden. powerful and tall, her girdJe fastened high, \vrapped in :'I gold-embroidered cloak., wearing earrings, a necklace and a crown of gold. and adorned with thirry oner skins.~ She is, thus, unmistakably a virgin goddess. like hcr Sumerian, Akkadian, :md Canaanite counterparts. Yet her virginity, as theirs, did not prevent her from being also the goddess of fertility: she was me goddess of rhe fertilizing waters, of a supernatural spring, located in the region of the stars. from which flow all the ri\'ers of me world. She was the one who multiplies the herds and wealth, gives rcrrili!)', easy childbirth, and :mlple milk. to women, and purifies the ~ed of men. She was invoked by marriageable girls and by women at the time of childbirth. Nor was she lacking in me attributes of the harlot. :md in her S3.nctulry at Era in Akiliscne, which contained her golden statue. the dlughters ofthe noble famihl!S ofArmenia used to prostitute themselvcs to strmgers before meir marriage. In Lydia. where she was identified with Cybelc. me Great ,"lother. as well as in Arrnerua and Cappadocia. because me bull was sacred to her shc \\'as conlounded with Artcmis Tauropolos. And finally, JUSt as Inmna, Ishrar, :md :\oath. Anahita tOO was the goddess of war, who rode in a chariot drawn by four white horses, Wind, Rain, Clouds, and Hail, bestowed "ictory on the combatant:; and gave them sturdy teams md bra\'e companions. Because of [his warlikt: character of hers, she was identified by the Greeks also with Alhene. while as the goddess of fertiliry she appeared to {hem as identical with Aphrodite. Most commonly, howe"er, she was called in the Hellenistic world the ~Persim Diana" or "'Persian Anemis..... In asrrology. the Irani:ms themselvcs regarded her as the pcrsonificarion of [he planer Venus. Her cult, according to Ikrossus, W:lS introduced among the Persians by Artaxcrxcs II (404-362 S.C.E.). who buill for her altars and set up her starues in Babylon, Su.sa., Ekbat:ma, Perscpolis., Sabra. Damaskos (? ). and Sardc.s. From these places. Persian inAuence car· ried her cult wcstward into the Greco- Roman world. At a later period. she was considered the daughter of Orn1U7.d, and the benefactor of all mankind, mother of all wisdom and queen.l

Matronit 139
The same four traits of chastity and promiscuity, motherliness and bkxxithirstincss. characterize the Matronit, the d:1Ughter-goddcss of Kabbahstic literarure. According (0 Kabbalistie thoory. the Matronit is but the lowest of the ten Sclirot. the mystical aspects or cm:mations of the Godhead which. to some extent. correspond to the Gnostic aeom. Yet whate\'er the primary meaning and origin of the Matronit as a tht.'osophic concept. she has been built up in Kabbali~'tic Iiterarure, and especially in the late 13th century Zohar-the holiest book of Kabbalism-into a palpable individuum whose actS. words. and feelings only mm sense if she is considered a nue mythological deity. Whatever the inrention of the authors of Kabbalistie treatises in creating or developing the female didne figure of the Matronit. one thing is ceruin: :unong the Kabbalisrs there rould ha\-e been very few. who, while reading or hearing about her uninhibitedly described exploits. were l'lC\'enhdcss able to visualize that she W:l5 nothing but an aspect of the manifest nature of the one and only Deity. For the masses of Kabbalistsand Kabbalism was a religious mIUS movement :unong the Jcw~ from the 15th to the 18th ernrurics-she undoubtedly assumed the character of a discrete dh;niry. in other words. she was t:Lkcn as a goddess, separate and distinct from the male deity who. when contrapositcd to her. was referred to as her husband. the King. The populm--m:vtIJiuJJ, as against the uholArl.,vmyrri<m view of tht.· Matronit had a marked resemblance to the popular Mariolatry of the Latin countries. where the Virgin is not the Jewish woman whose womb God chose to reincarnate Himself in human form-as the official Catholic doctrine has it - but the Mother of God, herself a goddess, who through the ages neycr ceased to perfo rm miI"3Clcs. and to whom. therefore. direct and personal adoration is due. This. precisely was me light in which the MatrOnit appcarx.-d to the uneducated or semi-educated Kabbalisric Jews; in contraSt to the: divine King who. following the destruction of the: Jerusalem Temple. withdrew into the rtmote heights of heaven and made himself inaccessible. the MatrOnit rctnalned down here on earth, continued [0 be directly concerned with the welfare of her people, and could be approacht.-d directly. any time. any place. She thus supplied the psychologically SO important female dh;ne: figure in Judaism.. a religion in which this element had bern submerged for many centuries prior to the emergence of KabOOlism.

Linle can be said about the: fir:.t of these cardinal features in the portrait ofthc di\lne Marroni(. Viqpniry• .lITer all, is a state shred b~' all human and dj\'inc females in an early stage of their life hmory. It becomes remarkable: onl~' if. after rcachmg full nubiliry. a woman prefers to remam a virgin and 3('rually prcscr.cs her virgmal st:ire in an envIronment, whether earthly or Olympian. wherc the general atmosphere IS onc of intensive scxual activity or c"en promiscuity. It becomes more than remarkable if the feminine figure in question herselfeng.ages In such promiscuous sexual activity and yet. at one and the same time. retainS her virgini~'. Yet this is precisely the paradoxical chastity characterizing sc\'eral ancient ~ear Eastern goddesscs. and thiS is the tUlt shared with thcm b~' the Matromt. The Virgm Mary. to \\hom rcfcrcnce ha( already been made earlier. also belongs to this category of female dlnnitles, and her ,"eneratlon can be adduced as an additional example: which will further facilitate our understanding of the paradoxical nrgmny of the .\Iarronn. Mary bore Jesus to God. and sc\'eral other sons and daughters to ht:r earthly husband Joseph. yet she nevertheless rem:l.lned "The \irgin" and is adored as such to this day. Similarly with the Marronit. who paradoxically rctaim:d her \'irgini~' while being the lo\'er of gods and men. Her virginity is spoken of in the Zohar in both figurativc expressions and direct statemenrs. The Biblical \'erse about the "red heifer. fauhle:~. wherein is no blc.nush. and upon which never came yokc."4 IS applied to her and explained as meaning that the jorce~ of E\·il could nner o\'erpower the Matromt. " neither Saran. nor the Destroyer. nor the Angel of Dcarh.~ all of whom represent the forces of Hcll.

As the farner-god EI says in an Ugaritic m~1.hiea.1 poem " . .. there is no restraint among goddcsscs.-" In the early mythica.1 ages. we are IOfornled in the Zohar. Jacob became the first husband of the Matromt. However. while Jacob was :tlh'e. the union \\':15 not consummated because. inveterate polygamist that he was. he conrinucd to have marit:tl n:1:nions with his rwo wivcs and rwo concubines C'\'Cr1 after the goddess :tnachcd herself to him. Therefore. only after his death. when his spirit entered the Ik~·ond. did Jacob couple with the M:ltronit.lo With her second husband. thlllgs were different. This was none other than Moses, who. onn.' ~he became his wife. separated himself from his earthly helpmate. Zipporah. Ha\'ing done this. he was aUoWl,..d to achieve what Jacob never did: tocopuJate with the Matronit while still in the Aesh.11 We hear noming of the Matronit from the death of Moses - when she took him on her wings and carried him from Mount ~ebo ro hiS unknO\\ll burial place four miles awayll-ro me time when the Temple: was built in Jerusalem. As Solomon bbored on me construction of tht' Sancruary. the Matronit made her own preparations for her union with her di\'ine hus· band. the King: she prepared a house for him U1 whICh he could take up joint rc:.idcnce with her and which.

IS - Thc wedding, a \'eritablc himJS ga:nos, was celebrated with due pomp ( and circumstance. Thc M:ltronit. surrounded by hcr maidens. repaired to her couch set up in the Temple. there to await the coming of the groom. The cunains rowld about were decorated with myriads of precious Stones and pearls. At midnight, the tinkling of bells he wore around his ankles announced the coming of the King. As he appro:J.cht.·d. he was accompanied b\' :J. host of divinc vouths, :J.nd thc m:J.idens ohhe Matronit welcomed him
;U;d them by bc:J.ti~g their wings with joy. After singing :J. song of praise to the King. the Matronit's maidens withdrew, and so did the youths who accompanied him. Alone, the King and the Matronit embraced and kissed, and then he led her ro the couch. Hc placcd his left arm under her head. his right arm embraced her. and he let her enjoy his strength. The pleasure of the King and the Matronit in cach othcr was indescribable. They lay in right embrace. she impressing her image into his body like a seal that leaves its imprinr upon a pagc of writing, he playing betwixt her breasts and \'owing in his great lo\"e that hc would never forsake her.l<> Some say. that as long as the Temple stood the King would come down from his hea\"enly abode every midnight, seck our his wife. the Matronit, and L'ljoy her in their Tcmple tx-dchamtxT. Thc Sacred Marriage thus became a daily, or rather midnighrly. ritual. pcrfomlcd not by the human represcn· tati\·cs of the god and goddcss who usually figured in the ancient Near Eastern New Year rituals. but by the two deitics themsch'cs. This divine union had unsllrpassed cosmic significance: on it depended the wdl·lx:ing of the whole world. 17
r Others say that the King and thc Matronit coupl~d only once a week, \ on the night bcn\'ecn Friday and Saturday. In true mythical fashion, this weekly divInc union scr\"~d as tht.· prototype, in other words, as the mythical \'alidation, of the traditionally practiced wcckly union between pious hus· bands and Wi\"e5. 18 In the Kabbalistic view, whcn the learned men, f3.J1liliar with the heavenly mysterics. couple with their wivcs 011 Frid:lY nights, the}' do this in full cognizancc of petforming a most significant act in dirttt imit3rion of the union which takes place at th3t very time between the Supcm31 Couple.

Matronit 147
who remains eternally virginal and who is insatiable in her sexual appetite, is also the mother image, the woman who bears, suckles, rears, and prOtectS both gods and men. In Kabbalistie mythology the trait of motherliness originally belonged to the second person in the tetrad, the Mother-goddess, the progenitress of both the Son-King and the Daughter-Shekhina,37 but it was transferred to the Daughter, as a few references will show. The Shekhina-Matronit. we read in the Zohar. is the (spiritual) mother of Israel. and as such she is the embodiment of the "Conummity of Israel" (the Hebrew term for which, Kncsscth ¥israel. has the feminine gender). She lovingly suckles all the Children of Israel, thereby providing them not only with nourishment bur also with complete well-being. She is, in fact, called the ""Lower Mother" in relation to her people, and in conrradistinction from her own mother, who is the "Supernal" or "Higher" Mother. The motherly nature is so Strong in the Matronit that she is unable to tum away even from the gentile children foisted upon her: after her exile from Jerusalem, when the "other gods," that is, the deities of the pagans, had their will on her, she gave suck to the heathens just as she had wet-nursed Israel.J8
6 IThe Warlike Matronit
The fourth characteristic of the virginal-wanton-motherly ancient Near Eastern goddesses is their bloodthirstiness. In the old mythological texts the maiden goddess of sexual love is often described as possessed of thc most appalling cruclty. The close to three millennia which had elapsed bcm·('"cn those myths and the period in which the Matronit of the Kabbala Rourished have. of course. left their mark. In the medieval sources, the warlike traits of the MatrOnit arc drawn with greater restraint. Yet the archaic feature of bloodthirstiness is clearly recognizable in the Kabbalistic references to the Matronit as the chieftain of the di\'ine armies, and the leader of the supernal forces against the opjX)Sing human and infernal powers of evil. It would be futile at this stage to search for connecting links between the bloodthirsty goddesses of the 3rd and 2nd millennia R.C.E. and the warlike Matronit of the 13th cenrury C.E. The idea of a warlike deity was, of course, nothing strange to Biblie:U Hebrew faith, but, in keeping with the officially embraced monotheism, all supernatural belligerence was attributed to Yahweh, who therefore is referred to as a "man of War," a slayer of dragons, and vieror ovcr human enemics whose life-blood crimsons his garmcnts.39 In Talmudic times (1st- 5th centuries C.E.), although the chastised and subjugated Judaism of the Roman and Byzantine eras had long

Zehar and other Kabbalists. Its frame is the visit rhat Rabbi Yishma'd paid to the heavenly halls, where he was met and guided by Mctatron. the chief ".tngel of the Face," who is none other than Enoch after his translation. The passage referred to reads as follows:
R. \"ishma'cI said: Mctatron, the angel, the prince of the Face, said to me: In the SC\'en halls st:lJld the four chariots of the Shckhina, and before each haJl st:lJld four camps ofthe Shekhina, and between each n\"o camps flows a ri\'er of fire. and between each n\'o ri\'ers the camps arc surrounded by mists of purity, md bcn\'ccn each n\'o of them stand pillars of brimstone. and bcnn:cll each n\"o pillars arc wheels of flame which surround them. and bcn\"cen each nvo wheels there arc flaming torches.....
While the interest of the author. like that of the Htklllwt literature in general. is focussed on the docription of the marvels scell in the hea,'ellly halls. [he idea that the Shekhina-Matronit is in charge of the heavcnly chariots and armed camps is clearly attested here as being pre-Zoharic. As in thc glorious past. so in the mystical present of the long erik, thc miserable Galuth. the Shckhina·Marronit is the warlike defender and deli,,· erer of Israel. But her power to defeat Israel's enemies depends ultimately on Israel hersd( The Shekhina· Marronir is always prcscnr in the midst of Israel ready to protect it from all sides and against all nations. But when Israel sins, it thereby weakens the hands of the Shekhina. her strength fails. and the great commanders of the other nnions, that is. theIr heavenly guardians, gain the upper hand. Bur as soon as Israel repenrs the Shekhina becomes filled with strength; she shatters the power of all those great com1Tl3J"Kk'fS, destroys the annics of Israel's <.'tlCIllics. and takes TC\'l.'tlgc on tht.m.45 Closely related to thc warlike aspect of thc Zoharic Shekhina·Matronu is her appearance as an enormous and monStrous being dcscrilx:d. by the author of the Zohar in terms borrowed from the MidrashlC picture of the Behemoth. This mythical cosmic animal is saId in the Midrash to be eating C\'ery day the grass of the Thousand Mounrains and devouring the many beasts that pasrure on thdr slopes. to be drinking in one single: gulp all the W2[ers of the Jordan and quenching its thirst from the huge ri\'cr Jubal.

Mary, like the Matronit. was considered as ha\'ing taken over the ro~-aI., governing, and conrroUing functions of God to the extent that her sovereignty actU:tlly eclipsed that of God.

Wc discussed a few of the mits which mm up the four aspectS of the Matronit-hcr chastity, her promiscuity, her motherliness, and her watlikeness (or bloodthirstiness)-which arc the most important componentS of her personality. The fact that precisely the same four aspects characterize also the ancicnt Near Eastern lo\'e-goddesses, and that their meG can be redisco\'ered in the Virgin Mary, makes us pause. \\'hence, we feci compelled to ask, this resemblance, this persistence of the par.ldoxic:ll goddess-figure in ostensibly and 3\'Owedly monomeistic religions?

short of the: most clabor:He research? And if a connemOIl were provcn, what would be gained thereby? There still would remain the question of why prccisely tIJis goddess achiC'o'ed such ;1 fabulous secondary career. among all the others just as readily available in the rich ancient Ncar Eastern pantheons? To answer this, we haw to shift from comparati\'e mythology to psychology, and once v,-c do this, the question of diffusion ~'m"11S independent invention oc-comes irrelevant. For whether or nor the Matronit (:md Mary) goes back u1timard~' to Inanna. her coming to life in new and very greatly changc.-d religious environments shows that she answered a psychological need in medieval Ashkenazi or Sephardi Jewry as she had in Sumer of the 3rd millennium S.C. E_ How can th is psychological need be made tangible? In trying to answer this question, we shall, of necessity, concemr:He on the Matronit-Shekhina. the medieval Kabbaliscic g<XIdc:ss-figurc. with whom this chapter deals. If we want to consider what the Matronit-Shekhina meant psychologically, we must \'iew her enti re mythical character comprised of the four major traits discussed above. They present MatronitShelbina as the mythologically objectified projccrion of the aU-round woman, the woman who takes on all the shapes. asfX"CtS, and appearances of the human female needed by the male of the species nor only for biological survival but equatly for his psychOlogical existence. The character of his n«d, which accompanies him from birth to death. from cradic to grave. ehanges as he lives out his allotted span. ~o sooner is he born of her. than he wants to be clasped to her ample. motherly breast and given suck by her. As he grows, he needs her protection and direccion. As S(X)n as hc becomes aware of woman as the opposite sex. he must h:l\"e hcr shine on his emotional horizon in virginal purity. When he has to Struggle with enemics or is beset by advcrsity, he rdies, in fuct or in fancy. on her to fight me forces of evil that oppose him. When he smartS under frustration or is discouraged by failure, he imagines her as the furious female who can do for him wha.t he himself cannot do, fearlessly plunging into arrack and fighting his battles.

When homclife beeomes monotonous and stale, she is then: with the thousand paimed f.tces of her allure and the cvcr-prcsem promise of her availability. And when the ultimatc exhaustion overcomes him. it is hope of her last kiss which makes him forget the birrerness of dying and instead think of death as the beginning of a new life in a happy Beyond. The Matronit is rhus the projcction of everything a \\'omm can be in order to sustain man.

In books dC3hng With m~'thologies of other n3.nons :1nd religio ns. the: inclusion of such toral pre· scnr:ltions of myths is me ruit'. The question then arises: why did srudents of Jewish mysticism who so frcquendy spe:1k of the mythological char:lctcr of Kabbalistic dc.."SCripoons of God, the: world, man. and the Interrelationships bcrwccn them, not follow the same path? It is always hazardous to try to fathom thc moth-ations that keep scholars from doing something, yet I believe I can \'cnrure a guess: the answer, it seems to me. could lie in the conviction of Jcwish scholm of the Kabbala and Jewish mysticism that Judaism differed qualitatively from the rdigion~ with which m~'tho1og)cs arc usually associated. For them., the: world of rdigion. until the emergence of Christianity, was divided mto twO mutually incompatible realms: mat of polytheistic paganism, and that of monothei~tic Judaism. Among Jewish historians of Jewish religion, this vicw was presemed most emphatically and in greatest detail by \"J:!ezq'd K:1ufnunn in his multi-volumc Hebrew "'lI!Jmmz O/'w, To/dol haEmu1Ul haTlff'eiil ( ~His{Qry of me Religion of lsr:ld").s Sueh \;ews arc, of course, nor confined to Jewish scholars, Historians of religion in general considered



God and the Shekh ina 157
mythology [he typical mode of expression of polytheistic rdigions, whose
gods and goddesses conducted themselvcs in a manner reflecting the mores of the nations that worshiped them. Pure monotheism, Whether Jewish or Olristian, was secn as cemering on the one and only omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God, who demanded a strict moral conduct from
the believer. a corollar" of which ,-jew was the denial of the existence of a ffi}thicaJ dimension as far as the relations of God and the world were conceml.-d. Islam, of course, shares this view, and in its insistence on the absolute oneness of God has radically opposed and extirpated from its official dOCtrine 3lI tr:l.ces of p::tg:m Arab polytheism. Something ofm is attirudc still characterizes Jewish scholars specializing in the srudy of Judaism in general and Jewish m~'Sticism in panicu]ar_ Schokm himself, although he almost singlchandedly rescued Jewish mysticism from the contcmpmolls neglect to which the 19th-ccnrury founders of the WisrmscJmft tUs judcmums had condemned it,6 was still influenccd by th(~ traditional scholarly view that saw in mythological polytheism a lower, and 10 a supposedly amythological Jewish monotheism a higher, manifestation of the human religious spirit _The "mythical epoch," Scholcm writes, was that of "'the childhc:xxi of mankind~: "'the trul\' monistic universe of man's m~tho1ogical agc" was "alien [0 the spirit of mysticism" which rep\:Jcc.-d it, although "'to a certain extent __ . mYHicism signifies a revival of mythie;l\ thought... :'~ The Kabbala itself, says Scholcm, "contains, side by side with a decp and sensitive understanding of the essence of religious fecling, a cmain mode of thought of primiti\-e mrthological thinking." s
It is not d ifficlIlt to understand why seholars such as Scholcm and his circk, who saw in the mythical dements in the Kabbala a "relapse into. m~thical consciousness;" and spoke of "primitive mythological thinking,~ were averse to the task of reconstructing a Zoharic or Lllrianic myth and of presenting it in a full and consecutive narrative. In any case it is a fact mat th9- did not undertake it. Scholem is acmally apologetic abom [he m~thologicJI clements he diseerns in the Kabbala when he finds it necessary

certainly ranking with other types of religious speculation and creativity. In fact, I must confess to deriving a certain satisfaction from having been able to dcmonstr:J.tc, first in my book Hebrew Myths (which I "Tote jointly with Robert Gr:l\"cs), then in a number of essays, and finally in thl,.' present book, that the ]t'wish creativity in the religious realm extended imo the field of mythology as wdl Y' Let me then perform the t:lSk from which other srudents of Jewish mysticIsm have shied away and reconStruct here in omline the myth of God and the Shckhin3, or, as they are often referred to in Jcwish m~'Stical literature, the supernal King and Queen. which, 1 believe, is the central myth of the Kabbala and H asidism. In piecing together this great myth from the original sources, I am n:sorting to the Jungian method of utilizing rele":lOt materials irrespective of the differences in time periods to which me sources from which me)' are culled belong. Here it goes:
At one moment in the course of His infinite existence. God decided to create the world. Since the All was up to that time totally filled with His being, He contracted Himself so as to make room for the created uni\·ersc. He crcated the world for the sake of man, and His self-limitation, im'oh·cd in the act of creation. showed how great was God's lo\"(.' of man. e"en before He actually cn::ated him. Once the creation of the world was accomplishcd, the All consisted of two partS: God and the world. No soc>ner did Adam become a sentient being than he began to contemplate the physical and spirirual worlds into which he was placed, and conunined a gr:l\'C sin that ever since has dogged the steps of ma.n. God's spiritual being was comprised of tm Sifirot (emanations or aspects), but in contemplating God Adam mistook the tenth and Imve.."t Sifira. that of Ma/kJmt, or Kingdom, which was the Shekhina, the female manifestation of God, for the totality of Godhead. Since the Creator endowed Adam (:md through him men in general) with the power of influencing the condition of the Godhead On High, by doing so Adam caused a fissure to occur between God and the Shekhina. Ever since this first original spiritual sin. man has e\'er and again repeated it-a mythical c\·cm that occurred in ilfo tempore is bound to be repeated. reenacted. again and again - and thus reintroduced, and made e"en more painful, the separation between God and His spouse, dK' Shekhina. When, in tht, course of history, the People of Israel came into being, the Shekhina, God's divine Matronit, became in a mystical way the Mother of Israel as well as the personification On High

This, in briefest outline, is the Kabbalistic myth of God and the Sht'khina. Tht': Lurianic kilvvfl1U}t ( "conccmrarions~) andyiJ!udim ("unifications") which we shall discuss in Chapter VIII an: the ritual countcrpan, the dromenon, of this grear, central, cosmic-spiritual myth of God and the Shckhina. The m)w itself, the Icgomeno'l, emerged fully famled in the Zohar in the 13th century. The ritual was not fully shaped until nearly three centuries
later, in the Kabbalistic center of 16th-century Safcd. Once the yil!l/dim had become established parts of the ritual practice of the Kabbalists, they secured the survival of the underlying m~'th of God and the Shckhina, while the myth on its part supplied the meaning of t.he rirua.! and validated it by underlining its significance and imperati\"e narure. Together, the myth of God and the Shekhina and the ubiquitous yiJ!udim that rumed the entire panoply of Jewish ritual into a constandy rcen3cted series of referc:nces to that myth, instilled into the K3bbalistic, and I3ter the Hasidic, believer the conviction th3t his words 3nd 3cts h3d 3 direct cosmic·mvstical inf:iuenc(' on the state of the Godhc:ad. l'othing else could have endowed the Jew in exile with 3 fi rmer conviction, 3 grearer self.-:lSSurance, concerning his own religious value and his crucial spirirual role in the world. To S:lY that this conviction counterbalanced the Jewish trauma ofliving in Exik :lS a scorned minority would be an understatement : it filted the Jew with the inner certitude that, despite his suffering in the Galuth, he lOwered high 3bo\"(' his Gentile tomlentor in every respect mat really counred in the re31m of the spirit.

UNIFICATIONS
1llr.: (eml YiJ!"d (""unification," plural Yil!udim ) a:. ll!>Cd in Kabbalistic and Hasidic literature rden [0 four different types of rituals. One of them is the ellunciation of J. ramer simple declararory statement, prior to reciring a prayer or performing a mit=.I'Q ( ~commandmcm" ) , to the efrect that rhe intention of the person doing so i:. to bring about rhe unification of God and me Shckhina. The s<..-cond is an incantation-like recital of the same or similar formu]:JS for tbe purpose of exorcising a dibbu'l ("spirir") from the body of a person possessed by it. The th ird consists of extremely complex mental exercises in which divim' names arc combined into one in lTl3Jl~' different ways for the purpose of thus achil'\'ing directly twO goals: to uni~' God :md the Shckhina, and to uni!)! the soul of the :tdcpt who performs rh(.' rite with the supernal soul of God. In this type the .yi~Jlldim arc perfonned for their own sake and fo r the direct effect they themselves are supposed to ha\"(.'. Finally, th(.' fOU rTh type of .yiJ!llliim sen'es cxpiatory purpoSl.."s: the atonement of sins, and the purification of the person whom sin has rendered impure.

purposes, all four types arc based on me dOCtrine that the: Shekhina suffers an exik which she shares with her children, the People of Israel; that the exile is a tragic st:paration between her and her divine husband, the Holy One. blCSS(.-d be He. which causcs unspeakable pain to both of them; mat the .vil?lIdim unite them, or at least diminish the distance between them and thus bring pkasure to both; and that therefore .riJ?ltdim arc the most importam religious acts a man em perform. We shall now have a closer look at each ofthesc four kinds of.vi~mdim.

One of the most rem:lrk.abk innov:ltions of the Kabbala is the ide:l m:lt it is the supreme duty-and privilege-of the religiously accom' plished man ro bring :loom a unifiC:ltion tx-tween God the King and His estranged spoUS(" the Shekhin3 (or Matroni.). We h3\'e seen above something of the Talmudic-M.idrashic mtcccdcnts of the idea that the Shekhinaoriginally concei\'oo as G<xfs \'isible and audible presence on eanh-had her abode in the Templt-. and that when the Temple was dcstroyt.-d she was forced to go imo exile. We ha\'e also learned that me union between mm and wife was considered by the Zobar a replica of the union between God and me Shekhina. and, at the sanK' time, the fulfillment ofone of me greatest sacred commandment:.. tX:·C:l1.bC it mystically promoted that di\'ine union and mus comributed to the o neness and wholeness of the deiro•. However. dle Zohar went a significant st(.'P farther than this. It expanded the concept of the influence humm conduct excITed on the stare of the deity from the sexual union between husband and wife to all MtJ performed by man. or. at least, to all rdigiousl~' meaningful acts. As the z.oharic tcxt putS it, Israel achicyed royal rank becatlS(' of its ~diligenr eftorrs ( ~"isIRad· lilt" ) in the Ton and the commandments to unite the Holy One, blessed be He. and His Shekhina, to bring the King [i.e., God] to His place and to His hosts On High ...~ I According to the Zohar, Qxi and the Shekhina arc not only £he supronr di\·ine couple, but also the spiritual-mystical parents of Israel. This is stared explicitly in the immediate sequel to [he above quoted passage which says that Israel '-are the children of the Holy One, blessed be He. and His Shekhina:' Of course. the Zohar also holds tim Adam himself was not merely me handiwork. of God, but an offspring of God and the Shekhin., as hinted at in a passage on the very next page of the Zohar which explains that when Adam ~cmcrged into the world. the sun and the moon saw him and their light faded [nisrnm: liu:rally, "became dosed up"), because rhe 3ppk of the h(.'(."1 rof Adam I darkened their light. Why~ Becausc he came:

from the work of the Supernal Sun and Moon," l that is, from God and thl.· Shckhina. EIscwhere the Zohar instructS the observanr Jew who is intent on fulfilling properly the romm:mdmcnu mat he must dedicate ~I his acts to God, (0 the explicit exclusion of me forco of evil: "Rabbi Hazar $;lid: 'In aU the am of man it i~ nec~' for him that they be for the sake of the Holy 1":amc~ What docs 'For me sake of the Holy ~:une mcan'1 To pronounce with his mouth the Holy ~ame O\'er everything he perlorms, so that c\'C'n'thing be in His sen·ice. and the.' Other Side should not alight on II. for it (the Other, i.e., Evil, Side] always lies in wait for men and can alight upon [hat act.~l This. to put it sImply, teaches mat all actS pcrfonned by man arc In cbngcr of being scized by ..the Other Side." that is, by me evil. Satanic forces. To prevent such an outcome. one must state clearly before pcrfonn· ing any act thar one docs it in the sen'ice of God. Below we shall sec a concrete example of :m act-mat of copulation-which must be dedicated in this manner to God to the exclusion of the arch·demoncss Lilith (sec p. 234. The doctrine attributed by me Zohar to R. Hazar is the background against which that incantation must be \'Iewed. In the thinking of the :luthor of the Zohar. even the prohibItion of adultery' I~ anchored In the conjugal relationship bctwcc:n God and the Shckhma, referred to as the "Community of brael":
When [he] was prepared for Adam, the Hol~' One, blCSM-d be He. blessed them" . like a cantor who blesses the bride with scven bcn<dictions. Hence we learn that the groom and the bride. once they arc being bles!tl..-d by the SC\'en bcncdictions {which arc pan of the tr3ditional wedding ceremony}. clea\'e to each other in a manner e."I:emplificd On High. Therefore he who goes to join the wife of mother damages the coupling. for the coupling of the Communi[)' of Israd is with rhe Holy One, blc.sscd be He, alone. .. . . He who joins the wife of another is as if he dl'Cci\'ed the Holy One. blessed be He. and the Community of Israel ...4
There is.. of course, :1 principal problem in all these referenccs to the mant:li relationship oc"tWl'Ol God and me Shd:hina, of which the Kabbalists thmtsch'cs were fully aware: it is the problem presented by the separateness of the Shekhina from the Godhead for the doctrine of the divine o neness. As Isaiah lishby put it (in my literal transl3rion):
The K:tbb:tlisrs ... recognized the rhcologic:tl danger comprised in It 1m the problem of the uni[)' of the Shekhina with the other

at kJ.'>t [Q facilitate, that Ji\'ine union adumbrated in tht· Zohar, \\'a~ ~t'iL('d upon b~' baac Luria, with whose work we arc well fa.miliar b\' now, and who \\'J.~ the most influential Kabbali~tic master since Moses de u.-on. Luria 1.:xpanded the Zoharie ideas into a veritable principle of motivation for the (·mirt· sphere of religious :Kti\"itic~. Ht· taught that when IX'donning any mit=,m ("religious eommandmenr''), one must concentrate on its om' sacft'd mystical PUrl>oS<.", which is to bring .1IXlUt the unification of God and thc
Shckhina. The t('rm km'l>a1Il1, which, as wc haw $(.'cn above, was used by Luria, is a Talmudic technical tt'ml describing thc principle that when perfOOlling a mi[zl'a one must do so with rh(' explicit intention (km'l'ana ) of fulfilling tilt' mit:;l'a in question. Ifone happened to pcrtorm a mitzm with· out such intenrion, it docs nor count. and one has to perform it again, this time with the n:quisitt, inrenrion. - A more complete Talmudic term tor the same concept is kfll'l>a1ll1t haicv, that is "concentration of the hean." ~ In Luria's usage the tenn km'l'allll \\"as endowcd with a highly chargctl meaning: it came to designatl' a most intense conccntration on the mvsrical
signific;nce of the rdigi~ls an 1:x:ing p~:rlonll(:d. This type of km'l>a1J~ had, and still has, its highly \'isible and audible l"Xpression in the body bnguagc of the Ha~idie )l-ws, heirs to the Luriani( tradition. E.g., wh(.:n they pronounce dlC words Sh'ma' risrac/ ("H('ar, 0 hrad"), the\' clo~ their l'\'C~,
pres~ one band against the fJ.ce, wmran the liKe mu~clc~ surrOllllding'dll: eye~ a~ tightly as they (an, ~\\'ing the upper part of the txxiy back and fonh with rapid and abrupt 1ll0\'t"lllem~, and ejacui.lIc the last word of the first sentence, £11M ("One" ) loudly and explosi\'cl\'. \\-1m lies 1:x:hind this behavior pattern is thl' coll\"iction that this most saer('d confession of faith must 1:x: recit~'d with such all imense concentration th:lt it must manifest itself in shaking the whok' lxxIy and soul. Luria recolllillended m;Jn~' kal'l'allot ("conct·ntrarions" ) which came to 1:x: considered by aU Kabbalists binding instructions, and were collected in a book titled Stjer ImKal'l'aliot ("Book of Conccntratiolls").'1 He suggested nothing less th:m the recitation of a fixed tornlllla 1:x:fore the perlormance of all the mitzl'Ot. The formula states explicitly that one'S intention in doing so is ro bring about dle ,villl/d, unification, of G<xi and the Shckhina. This suggl;"stion is rcpeated with sollle vanations several rimes in {h(' StftT ImKam>a1lOt and in numerous other sourcc.~ quoting Luria. A derailed vcr~ion of it was quoted abow (p. 146 ) in our discus~ion of rht· image of the j\brronit. A popular shon wrsion rcads as lollows: "For the unification of rl1t" Holy Om'. blcssc:d 1:x: He, and His Shekhina, in kar and 10\'e, to unite the rliH with WeH in a (ompkte union, in tht' name of all IsraeL and to raise up the Shckhina Irom tht' dusL ..."'" rliH .md IVcH are, of cour~, the two haln:~ of the most sacred divine name Yahweh, the first of which



is mystically idcntiik"<i in Kabbalistic doctrine with God the King. while the st"Cond stands for the Sh(·khina. The nlprure in the di,ine name reflects the separation between God and the Shekhina. and their reunion is mystically represented in the Union of YaH and tvtH. the reconstitution of the oneness and wholencss of the Godhead.
In the SCI" haKarmfUwt Luria is qUOted as ha\'ing said: "One must

3 IThe Spread ofthe Yil)udim
In its original Talmudic fonnubtion the concept of the exile of the Shekhina simply meant that \\'t'H..".I1 the Temple of JI..>rusakm was dcstroy<:..xi and the iX'Oplc of Israel exiled. the Shekhina, GOO's presence on eanh, went into exile with them. IS In the Kabbab, the c..xilc of the Shekhina. now identified \\'ith the Community of IsraeL came to playa much more impor.. tant role, and "to mean that a part of God Himself is exi/cd from God.." 10 The passages in the Zohar that describe this exile, the laments of the heartbroken Shekhina (or Matronit) O\'er her dt:Stroyed bed chamber. and her \'earning for her husband. God the King. are among the most mO\'ing in the entire Kabbalistic literature. l~
In the later. Lurianic. Kabbala the exik of the Shekhina and her sepa· r3tion from God arc gi\'en greater cosmic significance. The prefiguration of this tragic e\'ent, it is taught, occurred in the very days of Creation, when Adanl committed the sin of conremplating only the last Spra, MaJld'"t (identified \vith the Shekhin3), instead of penC'trating the \'ast uni~' and totality of all the Sefirot in his contemplation. He mistook Malkhut, the Sht'khina, for the whole of the Godhead, and thus shattered the unity of the Godhead. instead of consolidating it. 18 • The basis of this doctrine is, of course. the Kabbalistic ide3 th:lt the acts of man-in this C:lSC of Adam, the first man-have a f3tal dfcct on the condition of tht' dei~'. With Adam's sin began the tragic ph3SC of clea\'age in the deity that has been, and is still ocing, brought aixmt again and again by "the destructive and magical influence of human sin.~ Thus the exile of the Shekhina occame "a symbol of our own guilt. and the aim of religious action must oc to end this exile or at least to work in this din.:crion. The reunion of God and His Shekhina constirutes the meaning of redemption.~ 19 Herein lies th(' ultimate theosophic31 ground of the ,viJ!udim, the unifications. Although it is Isaac Luria who is generally credited with [he introduc· tion of.'yu,udim into the Kabbalistic doctrine and practice. in fact the idea seems to have ocen floating about in the i<.abbali!>tic atmosphere of 16th· century Safcd. It appears. for instancc. in the tcachings of Moses CordO\'cro ( 1522-1570). an older conteOl]X>rary of Luria. who, alcllough outshone by Luria in brilliance and influence. yet was wldoubtedly as im]X>nant a Kabbalistic thjnker as he.

This unification On High is also cxprcssc:d in the unification of the four leners of the name of God, YH\\11:. "This is the greatcst rule in tht' Tora" (pp. 99, 220). Al'iO by cstablishing a 1Q\'ing relationship with his fellow men. a man can bring about unification On High. Any "joining'" down below calL<.eS unific:uion of the ~3.mc of God above (p. 19). One must do this. if for no other reason than out of "pity for the honor afthe Name" (p. 19). Even
such a physical act as sexual union between man and womm c::mses On High the unification of rhe Name into EJ!mi ("One," p. 220). A r:l.ther complex scheme of "three kinds of copulation" is set up by R. Ya'aqO\' Yoscf to illustr:l.tc: me close interdependence of copulation down below on earth and Oh High in heaven:
In every [unercd] word [dibb/lr] there is a unification of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shckhina. There arc mree kinds of words which are called three kinds of copulation [=tpmlg]: 1. Copulation of the King and His Marronir. ... 2. Copulation of me son and his spouse.... 3. Copulation of sla\'e :md handmaid. . . . The words of the Tor:l. and prayer, when a man, wrapped in tallitb and tplii", secludes himself with his Creator-this is a copulation of the King of the World and the Matronit, a union of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shekhina.... [Mundane] talk is a wtific::ttion of the slave and the handmaid; words of Io\'e I:x:T\\'("\.'ll friends arc a copulation of the son and his spouse; and wben a man de\'otcs himself to Tora and prayers, if he knows that [they arc directed to] the Holy One, blc:sscd be: He, and His Shekhina, then he tk"S together [the Sefira of) Malldml [i.e.. the Shc:khinaJ On H;gh .... (p. 247).
As this bric:fprcscntation shows, R. Ya'aqov Yoscfwas almost obsessed with the idea of the unificatjon of God and rhc Shekhina, and with the religious imper::ni\'c to dedicate one's life to bringing it about. A contemporary of Ya'aqo\' Yosef was R. Elimclckh of L~~mansk (17171787), who had a central role in creating the \'eneration of t=addiqim,sa.intly
Hasidic rabbis. In his book. No'am Elimelekb ("The Grace of E!imclekh"),lI> he repeatedly I..'Xplains that it is :I sacn..xi duty to rceite yiJ!lldim:
If one intends to pcrioml a mit=.m, one must uncr with onc's mouth in speech that one wants to perfonn [hat mit=.l'a. and say.

A leading. Hasidic master of the next generation. much of whose rdig.· ious teachings centered on the Shekhina. was R. Moshe l:Iayylnl Efrayim of Sudylkov (ca. 1740-18001 ), a grandson of the Besht. His book.. Drgel ,lIal!IlIU Efra.vtm ( ~Banner of the Camp of Ephraim"), containing sennons on the wcckly portions of the Pentateuch, IS a classic in Hasidic literature. In It he wntes:
My gr.rndfarh(·r. may he rest in Eden and let his memory be for a blessing for life In the World to Come, s:\id that all things come from the Shekhina. so to sp":l.k, and all the deficiencies ['!tmmor] a man h::lS should be understood as deficiencies of the Shckhina. so to speak ... blessed be He :md bl(.'sscd be His >:amc ...

This p3.SS3ge calls for l fcw brief comments. One is that the author's repeated lISC of the expression "so (0 speak"' ( kil~ynkiJoi in the original ), when he mentions the Shckhina shows that he found it necessary to indicate that what he sa~'S aoout the Shekhina must not be taken in a literal sense lest one think that the Shekhina acts independently of God, o r that the Shckhina is somcthing other fhm. and different from. God . The "cry fact that the allthor in.scrtl.,.,{j the phrase ....so to speak~ three times III thiS shon

This IS rather incongmow., for each of the four words has the masculine form in Hebrew, while the Shckhina. both conceptually and gr.unmatically. is feminine.

OUf third comment is th3[ the :lUthor- once rc:fers to the Shckhina by the name Matron;t (i.e., ~Matron~ ) . which is usual in [he Zohar but rather unusual in Hasidic texts. :-':ew ;dso is the recommendation that all prayer should be dircct('d toward the goal of replenishing the deficiencies of the Shekhina (and thus secunng htl' c0mplete union with God); this can be done by ruuldi'lim through their kno\\1· edge which leads to a coupling of God and the Shckhina.

discourses but a complete. systematic explanation of the author''\' doctrines, In it he gi\'cs :l dct:lik-d cxplan:ltion of what is meant by the l'slum :l'iJ!Jld fannula:
This is the expl:ulJ.tion of "'for (he sake of the unification of the Holy One. blessed be He. and His Shckhina, in the name of all Israel": This knw411a [-concentration"] must be recited in one's ht:lrt, So thar onc's htarr should really desire this supernal unifi· Cltion. there must bc.' in one's he:lrt great lo\'e of God llone, to cause Him pleasurc abO\'c. and not in order to slili one's own soul which thirsts for God, but like :l son who excrtS himself for his f:!thcr and mother. whom he 100'cs more than himself. , , , In any case. one must hlbituare oneself to this kavralla. for c\'cn if it is not trul\' and full" contained in one's he:lrt. one's heart wants it
trol" at ieast to 3. ~'cr" linle extent, because of the natural [O\'c that
is i~ the heart of all 'Israel [0 do everything that is the will of the Supernal. blessed be He. And this unification is His true will. that is. His supernal unification in the emanation [atzilut! which takes
place through the aro usal down below [i.e.. in the human realm1. through the unification of the divine soul and its integration into the light of God which is dad in the Tora and the mitzJ'Qt with which she [the soul ] is occupied, And they become truly one, as I h:l\'e wrinen :tlx,.,e. for through this also dle source of the Tora and the mitzrot-which is the Holy One. blessed be He - unites with the source of its di\'ine soul which is called by thc nanlC Shekhina, For they arc in the capacity of that which fills all the worlds and in the capacity of that which surrounds all the worlds, . .. But as for the unification of his soul and its integration in the light of God to be one. this is what every man of Israel wants truly lnd fully with all his heart and all his soul, due to the natural 100'c that is hidden in the heart of all Isra.d, to clca\'e to God and not to separate and be cut off and separated. God forbid,
from the unification of oneness of (God] blessed be HC:l 2
The idea Shneur Zalman wishes to express in his cOIl\'oluted and repetitious sty[e is that by concentrating on the unification. one brings about :l union between "the divine soul" and "the light of God." that is. berwccn God and the She:khina. who together "fill all the worlds," MorOO'o'cr. Shneur Zalman assertS, e\'ery man in Israel clrries in his hearr a "'narural lo\'e- of God and the desire to cleavc to God, That is to say, the yU!ltdim have: twO aims: to unite God and the Shckhin:l, and to unite the: soul of him who performs the commandments with God,

was stated there to be the proper thing to do for those familiar with the teachings of the Kabbal:J.. lllUS, by reciting the _vi~J/fdim, the non-Hasidic Jew could fed that he performed rites that endowed him with at least a sembl:l1lce of being familiar with mysterious teachings about God. The Hasidic Jew was spared this difficulty. His rabbi, in harmony with his pra~'cr book, instructed him to recit~, the _vi~J/Idjm, :lIld he understood that by doing SO he was p<-'rforming a mommtous task, a duty of the highest order wwards God., a \'Cry great mir::'l'a. ;..Jar was me recital of [he .vill/ldim a rare or occasional thing for the Hasidic Jew, To the contrary. it was something he was instructed to pcrfoml a dozen or more times even' day, until it became for him something of a reflex action, Just as was the addition of the phrase -:;ikhn)1lo !tjymkJm ("'May his memory Ix for a blessing") after memioning the name of a deceased.

It is, in fact, 3 !:tte version of the prayer t:xxJk of the Sephardi Jews which was editt'd in the 16th century in accordance with the kmrfflllol, the nwsrica] "intentions." of Isaac Luria. It is thus but a late \"Crsion of tne prayer book USt·d by thl' Kabb:llistS in 16th-century Saft'd. On the \"Cry first p3ge the worshiper is instructed to recite. prior to wrapping himself in the rallirh, the unification fomm!:t wim which we art' by now thoroughly familiar, with the appropriate ending.

writings contain the first detailed accounts of dibbuq-possession, d<X."S not call the spirit which takes possession of a person by the name dibbuq, he refers to the phenomenon and describes it as a special case ofgiLI1IfI, rransmigration of souls.~ l The drama of exorcism fascinated tho.';C who witnessed it, and many of them, as well as ofthosc who functioned as exorcists,left behind detailed records of the procedures. One of the accounts tells about an exorcism that took place in Tibcrias in 1833. In it the dibbllq himsclfinstrucrs the exorcist rabbis how to proct-ed. He says (speaking, of course, from the mourn of the possessed person, in this ease a 20-year-old youth): "On Friday night, engage in smdying all night_ sanctify yoursckes, to perfoml unifications and to C;lUSC the supernal powers to couple...." The exorcists follow the dibbuq's instructions, and S:ly in unison: "With the comhin:ltions (t=ernf> of the Hoi\' One, blessed be He, :lnd His Shek· hin:l, we stand here t(xby before our master the divine Tanna, Rabbi Meir Ba'al ha::"Jcs, to sue this evil and rec:lJcitrant spirit... ;' :-':evenhcless the struggle between the dibbuq and the exorcists goes on for a long time, until at long last they succeed in expelling himY In many of the accounts telling about the exorcising of dibbuqim the central feature of the ritual is the rccitation of :rii?lIdim. often repeatedly, and always empharically,u One of these exorcisms took plaCt· in Baghdad in 1900, and is reponed by R. Y'huda Feraya, the exorcising rabbi, who, first of all, tries to a&cenain whether the person who for twenty years was bothered by "evil thoughts" is actually possessed by a dibbuq. 1ne way he does this is by "reciting into the cars of the man possessed the yilJlld of the spirit, so that me breath of the yi/?lId should enter his ear and his limbs. for the breath of the yi/?lId expels the breath of the dibbll'l'" The exorcist rdates: "I recited this yii?lId mmy times over, one after the other, speaking into the ear of me possessed, without interruption, until I became exhausted." He explains mat he did this because these '~yiJ?udim arc like fire in chaft~ and arc worse [for the dibbuiJ ] thm the pain ofGehelma .. . :' Finally. the dibllflq was no longer able to sufter me pain, and exited from the body of the patient /~i
Other examples, too, show that the yii?udim were believed to force the dibhuq Ollt of the txxiy of the possessed, md th:u by being spoken into the his ear they entered the "cavity of me body" and thus forced the dibbuq out. Occasionally the reciration of these exorcistic _vil!udlm went on for SC\·t.-raI days-in one rqxmed case (from 1913). the t..'l:orosr treared a woman patient with .yillUdim for no less than S(~ven wceks, while in another his dlons continued for a full vear.

:md trom other sources. dibbu'l'posscssion and rhe exorcism of dibbu'lim disappeared in the earlr 20th century.so The modernization of the religious amlOSphere. to which e\'cl1 the most traditional-bound Jewish circles could not remain inmlUnc. seems [Q have eliminated rhe belief in dibbll'lim which was the prime precondition of the occurrence of this rype of psychiatric phenomenon. 3J1d thus, after a carc..'Cr that spanned almost four centuries, the spirit known as dibbllfJ was finally laid to rest.

Luria's instnlcrions [0 the effect th:u one should recite the brief fonnula of l'sIJl'm ..w!lId "before C\'erything," that is, prior to rc.."Citing any pra~'er or performing any mit::;l'n, were imended for the Jewish public at large. For me adepts. the learned initiates. who in me Safed circle of the Kabbalistic masters constituted the intellectual-religious elite, Luria had insmlctions for an enrirdy diffe rem type of _yi~1/Idim whose purpose was. not to make sure that the recital of a prayer Or the performance of a mit::;].Yl scrn:d its ultimate aim. the unification of God and the Shekhina. but to achic..,,\·e, through intense concentration on the .yiJ,ud itself. a direct influencc on the condition of the Godhead. The basic purpose of these .yiJ!udim W:lS to reuni~' rhe Z'cr AI/pin ("'The Sm:lll of Face." or "The Impatiem One"). representing the male aspeCts of the Godhead_ with the Nllql'n diZ'tT (~The Female of (he Small One") representing his female aspect. The Lurianie insrruroons describing rhese unifications are cxtremcl~' complicated. They inmlye a kind ofmenral g:.l1mastics. requiring a verit3ble vimJosity in juggling complex and varying rules ofgcmntnn-the c..-quation and combination of the numerical values of the lcners of Hebrew words, and especially of the names of God-and necessitate keeping in mind an array of arrificiallv derived divine names. of which the o nes mentioned above arc but demenrary eX:lmples. Thus these .riJllldim constitute, nor :l rite inrroductot:' to prayt-rs or mit:;mt. bur ~a:n ilxlcpcndcm c.xcrcisc, dc..'t:Khcd entirely from the fonnat oftraditional prayer and the performance ofother mit::;mt.~.~ Isaac Luria, the chief initiator of these unifications. referred to them as :ril,mdint (t1..wmim, or ~supcmal wUtlcaoons." Since rhcir perfom1:lJlCe R'quin..-d not only intense concentration. but also took up considerable time that otherwise would have been deyoted by the adepts to Tora study. the ~ H oly ARl'- (Luria) 3J1ticipated objections from his followers, and fclt it necessary to reassure them: " Don't say that the study of [he Tora is greater. and that it is not seemly to neglect it. because the mentioned maner of the ;Villudim is grC3ter than srudying the Tora. for it lmifics the supcmal worlds."" One of the in~TIUctions of this type of,)iJlUJiim reads as follows: "Behold.

the supernal unification of f! okhma [~Widsom~J and Bina [~Understand ing"]8Q is that of the name YHWH with /-fokiml4, and the name £1,:,( with Billa, and the joining of them together thus: YAHHWHYHH_ This is the supernal copulation_ . .. In sum: Let him Ithe adept engaging in unifications] place the name YHvVH with its four letters before his e~'es, and concentrate on unifying the Holy One. blessed be He, and His Shekhina.
"~
According to Luria, the .villl/dim of this type had an immense effect on the spiritual world. Vital writcs:
He who performs a ~upcmal unification, the souls of twddiqim [deceased saintly men ] will clca\·c to him, and behold, the souls of the t=tuidiqim will re"eal themselvcs to him.... And know that Bcnayahu ben Yehoyada is the: one who is prC!>Cnt and rc\cals himself in all places where a ]i1!lId is being perfornll~d, which causes the Female Waters to rise up. And the ~cret of the marter b that there were many ~djqjm who in their lin.""S were always perfomling supernal :~jl!udim. ... He who p<.-rfomlS a unification at a propitious time ClUSCS the unific:uion of all the supernal rOOts. and this is a vcry high grade....91
The passage requires some explanation. Ben:tyahu ben Ychoy:tda was one of the high officers of King D:tvid. the commander of the Chercthitcs and Pelethitcs, who is reported to han- performed. '"'mlghry deeds" (2 Sam. 23:20-22 ). and who. :tccording to Luria. :tccomp:tnied ~anyone who performed supernal unifiClrions."9Z The raising of Female W:tters refers to the power inhercm in the: N uql'a diZ'", who is the female counterpart of the Z'er Anpi". The power that thus ascends from the Female in nlrn arouses the Male \Vaters which arc the power flowing from the M:tie to the Female:. a.nd thus bring about a union of the l"\\"o."J According to Luria the ,YI·J,udim should be pcrfonned either in one's home. or, preferably.:tt the gr:tve of a departed t=addiq.~ It so happens that in the neighborhood of S:tfed there were (and still arc) numerous tombs of such holy men as Shim'on bar Yo~ai. Rabbi Akiba, Hillel and Shammai, Shemayah and Avtalyon, Abbaye and Rava. Thus it was not difficult at all for the :tdepts to go and prostr:tte themsch'es on one of these graves as recommended b" Luria. The rite consisted. of stretching oneself out full

In the sequel R. T:tbul explains thar by perfonning unifications one achieves a union octween one's own soul :tnd ghost and spirit. and those of the t:;nddiq over whose graw one prostf3.tes oneself. He gh'es explicit instrunions as to how to concentrate on the letters of the name of God ()'1{WH ), and how to combine the ktters of this name with the other divine name Ehyeh. and the letters of YHWH with the letters of Admmy. In these complicated K:tbbalistic ment:tl exercises one feels that the original purpose of the yil?udim, namely the unification of tht· mall, and felll:tlc clements (or aspects) of the Godhead, is lost. and the accent is on tht, gematria, the \,irtuosity in combining the letters and in producing long J.nd practically unpronouncable divine names to which quasi-magical qualities arc attributed. Next R. T:tbul rums to ""'the .vil?l/dim which my Master taught me. mouth to mouth. word by word. letter by letter," The first oftheSt: instructs the adept what to do while reciting the Sh'ma' prayer, in order to c:tusc the "Female Waters" to risc to the Sefira of Bma ("Undersr:mding·').

One can only extrapolate from rare written records left behind by ka.rned men whose writings contain indications or betray traces of what must have occn the beliefs of the simpk: pt_"Ople, One such n..'cord is con· taint-d in the book Mgi/lat S'rarim ("Scroll ofSccreu") written by R.

Hence it may not be brictched to conclude that the yii!lIdim. which unquestionably were part of the e\·cr:-'day lift.': of the community at large, crea.ted a susceptibility to visions of the Shekhina and to experienccs of mal1!Jidim in many more people than would appear from the number of surviving accounts. Many could have had, in fact, must have had, such \'isiollary experiences in order to enable the few learned and talented among them to describe their visions in largely similar temlS, and to kave them as a legacy for us [0 study and ponder. Visions and hallucinarions were, of course, but one type of phenomena in communities for which Kabbalisric and Hasidic ma:.tery was the acme of accomplishment. lkyond thal WOb me psychological efft-ct of the doc· trines themselves, of which even the least knowledgeable had to have some inkling.

THE SHEKHINA AS MAGGID AND VISION
l iAs Maggid
In chapter IV above we referred to statements made bv some Talmudic sages who claimed to ha\'e seen or h(':lrd the Shckhina 11\ hcr earthly manifcstJtions, and cited T:tlmudic and Midrashic passages speaking of individuals and the Children of ISr.1e1 in gencr:ll as having MfL'3Stcd their eyes on the Shckhina," i.c., of having acrually gazed at her. These pmagcsnot fO mention such Biblical \'isions of God Himself as those of Isaiah (6: 1-5 ) and Ezekiel ( I :26)-madc it possible for medie"al and later Jewish mystics [0 claim that their own \'isionary or auditory experknces of the Shckhina did not go beyond the pcrn1issiblc within the framework ofk-git· im:ltc Jewish doctrine. Inc\'it3bly. it was the Kabbalists who put forward such claims 3nd n."Cordcd their perceprions of divine sights and sounds. Early Kabbalistic lireranm... and in the first place the lohar, contains

In the 16th cenrury the th'e most important KabbalistS ofthe Safed eirclc - Joseph Caro, Shlomo Alqabc.-rz. Moses Cor<kr..cro, Isaac Luria and l:Iayyim Viral-had [heir maggidim and left behind accountS of [heir experiences. After them, the ma~qgjd phenomenon continued weU into the 18th cenrury. while other types of supcmarural \·isions occurred e\'en in the the 19th. The history of mn.!1!Jidism has still to be written, but S<.'veral of the individual Kabbalists who s;'iW imag("S and heard voiccs of mnj{!Jidiffl have already come under scholarly scrutiny. It appe:lrs that the first rn:lSter in whose ci rcle the image of the m"!1!Jid crystalli7.cd was [he 15th-16th century Spanish Kabbalist YosefTaita7..3k.. who indulged in se\'ere ascetic practiccs, and reported having recci\'ed re\'elations in Hebrew from a ma~llfJid. After the Spanish expulsion ( 1492),Taitazak settled in $alonika, where he became the head of a group of discipleS whose members subsequently moved to Safed and founded there the great Safed school of Kabbala. 1 The Kabbalistic master in whose life the ma_llfJidplayed the most impurUnt role was Joseph uro (1488- 1575), the oldest of the th'e mentioned above. Caro is the most famous and most influential eodifier of Jewish law of all times, whose Shtl/~Jall 'Antkh is the last. and to this day authoritative, halakhic code of Judaism. Lcs~ well known in non-Kabbalistic and nonH asidic circles is the fact - somewhat embarrassing for them - that Caro was also a leading Ka bbalistic master in 16th-century Safed. He kept a secret Kabbalistic diary for half a century, of which the only suryi\'ing fragment was printed under the title M"!1!JiJ M($lJarim, that is, "Teller of Truths." z The inHumc!; of the mnggid on Caro was all-cncompassing. Not only did the mnj{!Jid communicate to him scmlOns interpreting the secrets of the Kabbala and passages in the Bible, but also gave him pr:lcric:tl help, guiding him in his wanderings in Turkey. directing him to emigrate to Ercrz Israel (at the time a Turkish province), and, most importantly from the point of \'iew of the deYclopment of the SIJltllpln 'Arnkh, stimulating him to \\TIte his hal:tkhic works. The mtr.!1!Jid also functioned as uro's mentor in personal marters, cncour:tgcd him to live :t srrictly moral life, and C\'cn promised him that he would achieve his great dream-martyrdom, although in fact this was never attained bv him. l Caro and his ma.!lqid arc of sp<-xial interest to us in the prc.scnt context because Cam idt'nrified the divine p<-'TS(xlJge who accompanied him through most of his long life (he liv(-d to be 87) with the Shckhina. In addressing Caro, th(' maggid identified herself as the Mother, the Shekhina. the Matronit-all Kabbalistic temlS designating the mystical divine spouse of

I L Incidl."tl.Ily, as \\ hblowsky has pointl-d out, the tcnn "llI!l!Jid aptX"3.I"S in the writings of Caro and Alqabetz only once or nvice. The usual desig· nation for [he ~pirirual persona who addresses Caro is '10/ ("'mice"), or
tiiblJltr rspecch~). 12 Intercsring is the phnsc in which the Shekhina describes herself as being in exile among mrarim v'Jnlumim. which is a modified qoorc from Ezekid 2:6, where it means "'briers and thoms," but which in the approbation of [he Jemsalem rabbis w the Mn,Pjid MesJmrim, as Wer· blo\\"sky suspects, could be a plln :md inrt"nded to be read Srrbim uS'/tlPrmim, that is, ~Serbs and Sbvonians." since the consonants of the n\"o Hebrew words as they appc:lr in the Bible can be read thus as well. lJ With rhe third of the group, Moses Cordo\'('ro ( 1522- 1570) we havc dealt in the preceding chapter, but what he has to say about the ma.!f!Jui belongs in tilt· present context. Ii Cordovero wrotl' a book-length treatise about angels in which he discusses the mn,!tq:d III some detail. He refers to :mgelic spirit·possession by saying that angels can "clothe themsch'cs into
:l man,~ and th:n such an angel possessing 3 man is -what rx:opk call "la!J!Pd." By Ixing posS(.'s~d in this manner, "3 person c,m occome a prince, a king, or a propht·t ... and a chariot lor the Holy One, blessed be He...." When thl' Children of brad went into the field to fight the Philistines. ·"the Shek· hina was With Israel in their war. and her chariot was the mySte~' of the king." When a person is thus tX)sscsscd by the Shekhin:l. "'he Ii..·ds nothing but heaviness of head, no ringing of the cars...." From thi~ Cordovero concludes that "all the :lcts of a m:lJ1 must be for the sake of Hea\'C1l in thought, so that he straighten his thoughts in those acts for the sake of the unification of his Cre:J.lor, as is known, and he should utter with his mourh, 'For thl' sake of the unification of the Ho ly One, blessed be Hc, :lnd His Shckhina; and then pcrlonn the :let. so that the act should not be sfX)ilcd ... and then the T::.addi'l [i.e., Godl will alight on that act, and e"il will be removed from It:' In the sequel CordO\'ero touches upon :l t3mrite subJcct of the Kabbalists, namel~' that coupling oc'twecn man and wife must Ix perfomled with awe and dedication:
And this IS the great prinCiple in procreation, in the union of man and wife. for there is nothing that promotes the presence of £\'11 Lilith there :lS does this act. Ikcause it is a great achie\'cnlelU to beget:l child who slIJ'yi\'cs. who builds worlds, rather than to tx:get,

One must beware of having strife and quarrel in one's house ... for then, instantly. Lilith will be present there. And let him (the husband] know that he represents the Supernal Groom, and his wife the Supernal Bride.... IS
We shall sec below examples of Kabb:tlisric anxiety ()\'er the inrerferencc of Lilith with the sacred act of union bct\\'(:en man and wifc (pp. 234-35). Here, in Cordovero's teachings, we see the general background of that fcar: the concern with the d:lIlger that Lilith or some other forces of evil m:ty interfere and "'spoil" any pious :let perfonned, and we arc rold that the method of preventing it is to r('Cite the ....unification" formub discussed in the preceding chapter. Nat in chronological Ord<..T comes Isaac Luria ( 1534-1572). "ith whom we :trt' by now well acquaintc:d, :tnd woo was by fur the most influential of the Sated K:tbbalists, and this despite the f:ter that he spent only the last tWO years of his life in 5aied and th.!! he died at the young age of thirryeight. He C:Ulle to be referred to as me ""divine R:tbbi Isaac.~ or. from the Krostlc of these thn.--e words in Hebrew, as HaAR1lmQadQs/}, ~the Sacred Lion.~ In contrast to the other leading 5afed masters, Luria himself \\Tote next to nothing. The works usually referred to as KinV' haA.R1, ~[he writings of Luria.~ were actually wrinen by his disciples. and in the first place by l;f.l~:1m Vital. who carefully reeordl-d his teaChings, creating an extensive corpus of Lurianic works which. in tunl, had a unique influence on the de\'clopmem and spread of the Kabbala. Thus it is from books compiled
by l:Ia~:'im Viral that we kno\\' of Luria's maggidism. although, in fact, it is difficult to determine where in these books the record of Luria's tClchings ends and Vital's own ideas begin.
,\·10rco\"er, one of the twO books which conrain most of me infomlation on Luria's I1U1lWid experiences, fhe Shn'ar haYiJ!lldim ("Gate of Unifications"). was compiled not e"en by l:il~:'im Vital bur by his son S3Illud Vital. The other book, SIJa'nr RUN! hnQodcsh ("Gate of the Holy Spirit"'). forms onc of the eight "Gltes~ inro which l;fayyim Vital organi7.cd Luria's teachings and which he entitled 'Et= IHllia.v:rim ("Tree of Life'"'). This work tOO was reedited ;lnd rearranged by S;lmuc! Vitai. 1& The LlIri:lI1ic doctrine of maggidism as it appears in the Virals' pres· CIlrarion, has :1 distinctly non-spiritisric color3tion. The mnlwid is not the spirit of a deceased saint or master. nor the audible manifestation of thl' Godhe:1d, bur comes into being as a result of an :1depr's srudiousncss, piety. and prayer. As Lawrence Fine put it. "the Voice that a m3Jl ufters while

At a laeer point in time, this crcJ.tcd spiritual \'OlCe descends below by 'dothing' itself in the mystic's current voice....~ or, It joins "'with the voice of a departed Zaddik (righteous pt.·roon) in the world abm"c," and then, having merged, "'the twO \"oices ... descend md spc:tk through the voicc of the adt·pt." J· In Luria's maggidism, as reported by the Vitals, the ma~qgid is not identifi ed with the Shckhina, but has some connection with the Sifira of lWnikJ",t (""Kingdom"), which. as we h3\'(' seen, is identified with the Shckhim,l' I:b.yyim Vi.tal ( 1543-1620) was rhe youngest of the fin: KabbaliSts mentio ned.

However. there is one significant d iffe rence: while in the Zoharic \'isions the sages who appear arc the sole apparitions and sources of myst ical instruction. in Scrjun's visions the sages. either Tannaim or Amoraim. appear in the company of "the H oly Shekhina,~ As for the contents of the revehtions themscl\'C:s. they all deal with -the S-lcred soul" of Shabb:lt:li Zevi. the meaning of his apostasy, and related issucs.l<I Somewhat later. but still in the 17th cenmry. revelations of hean:nly maggidim concerning Shabb:uai Zc\'i and the legitimacy of his messianic mission became frequent among Italian Kabb:llists.! l The usual contents of the communications the Sh:lbbarai:ln \'isionaries claimed to ha\'e received from their tJI'¥1!Jidim were confimlations of the messiahship of Shabbatai Zc\-j , One of them was M ord'k.hai Ashkenazi (d, 170 1) from Zholkva (Zolkiev). :l rabbi, preacher. and Kabbalist who spent ~111C: time in h:aly and cJaiml-d (0 ha\'e received a new reading of the: Zohar from heavenly 11Uf.!{!1idim, H is book. ritk-d Es/;eI A llraham ("The Tamarisk of Abraham"),

He tells them ro go down to a ra\·ine ncar Smyrna with R. Eliyahu haKohcn, who. he a:.5ures them. will be accompanied by his mlt-'.l..qid. Once there. they should take five stones. "each the size of a fist or bIgger." recite the \·en.<: "And a river went out of Eden" etc. (Gen. 2: 10--14).

The R. Eliyahu haKohen mentioned in Cardow's tre:uisc is none other than his friend Eliyahu haKohcn halttamari (d . 1729). [he famou~ author of SI1el~t MUSJar r Sceprer of Chastisement") and of the Midrash Taifi.vot. which we had occasion to quore. He roo W:b the recipient of lIUJtll1idic communications. and d~ribed the image o f his ma.!1!Jid. r The last flare·up of maggidism took place in the 18th century when it caused a stonny dispute between the poct and Kabbalist Moses f:layyim LlI7..7..atto ( 1707- 1746) and his opponent.s. led by the anti·Shabbataia.n Kabbalist Moses l-:Iagiz (l672-ca. 175 1). Luzzatto. whose Kabbalism was tinged with a .\ kssianic coloring. considered his own marriage ceremony as svmbolie of the unificatio n of the Shekhina with her divine husband. and claimed that a matf!Jid spoke to him while he was awake. and not in a dream. This was a claim the older and more moderate Moses l:fagiz could not countenance. and fdt that he must decry it .l~ Luzzatto was twenty when he had his first maggidie revelation. and thereafter both his life and his writings were brgdy detennincd by his mn!J--'1id. In order to achieve communications from the miJ~qgid Luzz:mo eng3g:cd in persistent .vilpldim exercises and meditarions. Like the other Kabbalists who cla.imcd ro ha\'e ma.!1!Jidim. Luu..atto did nor sec his maggid but only heard his \'oice as he spoke through LU7..7..attO's own mouth. How· ever, in contra.st to [he mnggid who spoke through the momh of Josc:ph e,ro and could lx' heard b~' all those present. the words that LU7..zatto's ma!I..nid put in his mouth could be heard only by him. After thn.:c months of this. the Prophet Elija.h appeared to Luzzalto. and gave him cschat(}loo:ical messagcs. Later the chief angel Mtt.uron, Abraham, Moses, and R. H;mnuna Saba also would addrcss-him. Two years after the inceptio n of these hallucinations LU7..zatto·s maggidism entered a new stage : he was now pemlitted to submit questions to the ma~'t!Jid. Throughout, much of his maggidic communications dealt with Shabbatai Z£vi . In o ne of his letters (in 1730) Luz.zatto wrOte to R. Benjamin haKohcn Vitale ( 1651- 1730), the Kabbalist and longtime rabbi of Reggio: "1 was most diligent about the :y;I!lIdim, to pcrfonn one .YiJ!J,d almost ~'"\'e~' quarter of an hour. and so I continue to this day." Luzzatto took some of his .vil!lIdim

A student of Luzzatto, R. Jacob Forti (or ~a7..aq, 1689-1782), who .seryed as chief r:J.bbi of Padua, givcs a slightly different version of the mlltf-"id's n:une: he c:tlls him Shim'j'r/.

More or less simultam..-ously with the appearance of mlli18idism occurred c.:l:pcrienccs of visionaries who saw the Shekhina. JUSt as the former had its rootS in the divinc or :J.ngclic "oices heard by Biblical prophets, and in the Bat QoI (literally, '"'Daughter of Voice"). me divine \-oice heard by some Talmudic sages. so me laneI'. as we have indicated aoo..'e, J.lso h:J.d their Talmudic. Midrashic, and even Biblical amecedenrs. The earliest exanlple of a \'isual appearance of a heavenly being in the form of a woman is found in the Midr.tSh Pesi'lta Rabbati. It is based on the propht.-cic-poctic image of Zion :J.S me mother of the People of Israel. to whieh frequem rderences are made especially by Isai:lh. in scveral of the Apocrypha, and in the earlier Midrash.~J The Ptsiqta Rabbati, a Palesrinian Midrash daring probably from the 7th cenrury. contains this passage:
Jeremiah s:J.id: When r went up to Jerusalem. 1 l<Xlked up and saw a wom:m sin-ing on top of the mount:"tin. clad in black, her hair dishevelled, crying and hoping that som("-ol1e would comfon her. And I t<Xl was crying and hoping that SOlTk."One would comfort me. I approached her and spoke to her and said [0 her: ~ I fyou are a woman. speak to me. and if you arc a spirit. get awa~' from me!" Shc responded and said to me: "Don't ~'ou recognize me? I :un she who had sc\'cn sons. Their fathcr went o\'erscas, and while I

to her: "You arc not better than my Mother Zion. who has become a g.razing ground for the beasts of the field.'" She answered and said to me: "I am your Mother Zion. I an1 the mother of seven. for it is written, 'She that hath borne seven languish<."th' (Jc..T. 15:9 )."32
In me sequel Jen::rniah "pro.'CS" to Motht.T Zion dm just as God rcsrettd the suffering Job to his fonner st:lte of well·being, so He will restore and rebuild hcr as well. "'hat we have here is a description of:l vision supposedly had by the Prophet Jeremiah, in which l"lother Zion appears in the shape of a mourn· ing woman who enters into a dialog with the prophet, and even qUOtes a w:rsc from his bcx:lk. Her image is so n:alistic that the prophet mistakes her for :l flesh and blood woman. although there must h:'I\'e been something in her appearance that made him suspect that she might be a spirit. Jt'remiah had advance knowledge of the existence of a hea\'enly woman symbolizing Zion. for he says. "You arc not better than my Mother Zion ...~ but he still docs not rccogni7"c the woman whom he sc..'CS before him. Hence the "punch linc" of the \'islon: ~I am your Mother Zion ... ." Some eight centuries separare this description of Jeremiah's "ision of Mother Zion from a description of the appearance of the mouming Shek· hina vouchsafed to the Kabbalist Abrahan1 ben EUL"ZCr haLe"i Bcrukhim (ca. IS IS- 1593}.lkrukhim was bom in Morocco, immigrated ro Palestine probably before 1565, and became a disciple of Isaac Luria. Ht, was an ascetic and a visionary, and a great devOtec of the holiness of tnt· Sabbath, about which he wrore a bcx:lk. TUfIJlme Shabbat ("'Rules of the S3bbath," published in nwncrous editions). He also collcrted sections of the Zohar not included in the Manrua 1558-1560 edition; these were subscqucnt~r published under the title Zohar l-jadaJh ("'New Zohar"). The account of Berukhim's vision of the Shekhina is contained in a k-n:er written from S3fed by R. Shlomo Shlomcl of Drcsnirz, himself 3 well· known Kabbalistic :lUmOr who settled in Safed in 1602. Ap3n from the \'ision. this letter contains indications of the enonnous influence isaac Luria had on the Safed Kabbalists.
(R. Abraham haLcvi Bcrukhim J would rise every midnight and
walk abour in the streets [of Safed1, and raise his voice crying aloud witn a bitter voice: "Arise for the honor of the Name, blessed be He. for the Shekhina is in exile. and our Holy House is de\'Ourcd by firc. and Israel arc in great trouble... :- [Once Isaac Luria told
him: I "Go to Jerusalem, and there go to the W<:stem Wall, and pour out rour prayer and your tears. and then. if you will find favor with your Creator and will merit to sec the Shekhin3, rhen you

em be sure that you will live another 22 years." As soon as R. Abraham hal..c\; heard this, he inst:mtl\" sold all the things of his house for the expenses of the trip, and went to Jerusalem, and instantly shut himself up three dars and three nights, in fasting and in S:lckcloth and in great wceping, and did nor mo\"e from there. And aner three days he went to the Western Wall and pr.l.yed there, and cried bitterly. And when he lined up his eyes he saw on tOP of me Western \-\'all the shape ["dugma"] ofa woman
behind hcr PI. and I don't want to write hen: in what kind of doming he saw her, for I fear for the honor of our Creator. And as soon as he saw her in that manner, he fell upon his f."1ce on the ground, and cried and wepe ~Mother! Mother! Mother Zion! Woe to me that 1 sec you thus! .. :- And so he rn(.'d bitterly, and ocat upon his face and tore his beard and the hair of his head, until he fainted, fell dO\\TI, and slept upon his face. Then he saw in a dream that she came and put her hand on his face and wipc.'d away the tears from his e\'CS, and said to him: " Be comforted, my son Abr.l.ham, for 'there is hope for thy future, and mey children shall rerum to their own border' (Jer. 31: 17), for ' I will cause their captivity
to rl'nlm and r will have compassion on tht.m'" (1er. 33:26). And R. Abraham awoke from his sleep, and rcrumed to Safed joyfully and happil~', and when me ARl of blessed memory saw hinl he said to him: ~I can sc.'C in rou that you merited appearances of the Shekhina, and from now on you can be sure [hat you wilt lh·e another 22 years." And so it \\,3.", for he lived after this 22 years.3l
The affinity of R. Berukhim's ,;sion with that artribured to Jeremiah by the Midrash Pesiqta Rabbati is obVIOUS, despite the new clements eontaim.-d in me story about the S:U/..-d Kabbalist. The words the woman addresses to R. Berukhim arc quor:ltlons from Jeremiah. Luria identifies the apparition, both before and after the occurrence of R. Bcrukhim's vision, with the Shekhina. R. Bcrukhim. however, recognizes in it only ~Mother Zion" (as did Jeremiah), and this despite the fact that he himself was daily (or nightly) preoccupied with the pain of tl1e Shekhina. and that the thn:e days of fasting and mourning he engaged in in Jerusalem before going to the Western Wall could have been done only as an expression of his grief over the exile of the Shekhina. R. Berukhim's dsion is divided into twO pans: :It first, while awake. he S(.'CS ~Mo[her Zion,~ reacts in vehement desper.l.tion, and faims. 111el1. while asleep (or unconsciousn. he feels Mother Zion touch his face, wipe away his tears. and hears her address comforting Biblical quorarions to him.

have not come across other instances of such a doublc visionary experience in both a conscious and an unconscious state one after the other. It is noteworthy that, as compared to the maggidic revelations, me visual or visionary appearances of me Shekhina are much rarer. This may have something to do with the auditory rather than visual orientation of the Kabbala and Hasidism and their followers. Jewish mysticism is based primarily on the spoken, heard, and written word; visual experiences play a rclativd~' minor rok in it. The same holds good in the realm ofcombatting the "Other Side," as evil powers :Ire referred to, and their dangerous influ· e!lces: it is primarily verbal methods. prayers, incantations, concentrations, wlifications, and the like, mat arc employed to pro[cct a person or :I placc from being attacked or hamlcd, or to rid him or it of thl' presence of evil spirits, dibbu.qim. or demons, and only secondarily are \'isibk Objl'cts, such as qameo!, amulets or talismans, u~d, and even if they arc, it is the written word on dlem that makes thcm efikacious. Yet withal, occasional appearances of the Shekhina wen: rcportcd by Kabbalists and Hasidim, even after the 18th-century decline of maggidisrn. Tht" dcsirt" to be muchsafcd m~'stical visions of the Shekhina produced, at least in some cases, visionary experiences which were then duly put down in writing. A H asidic master who was most interested in Shekhina visions recorded by, or reported of. leading Kabbalists and T:;,addiqim, and who himsclfhas such visions, was the prolific author R. Isaac Judah Jehic::l Sarrin (o r Sifrin, 1806- 1874). In one of his books, entitled NJriv Mirzrotekba (" Tht" PJth of Thy Commandments"),3-< he d(:scribes, among other visions of the Shekhina, the one seen by the 16th-century Kabbalistic master R. Abrahan1 haLevi Berukhim, with which \\'t" arc by now familiar from me 17th-century account of R. Shlomo Shlomd of Dresnitz (sel..· abo\·e). Less inhibited than R. Shlomo Shlomd. R. Safrin supplii..'S some additional dl.."t:lils about the woman R. Berukhim saw on tOP of the Westem Wall. She had the "shape of the likeness of a woman dressed in black," and R. Bentkhim instantly recoglll7..cd her as the Shckhina. He did not address her, as in R. Shlomo Shlomei's account, as ~Mother Zion," bur cried out, " \-\'De to me thar I must see you fhus~~ lnd faimt"d . In his sleep (fainting and falling asleep seem to Ix the same thing for R. Safrin ) R. Berukhim sees mat "the Shekh ina approaches him in the shape of the likeness of a woman adorned in beautiful clothes, \"t"fy radiant,~ and he hears her add ress to him the same words of comfort qUOlcd by R. Shlomo Shlomd. The major difference between dlC tWO accountS is mat in the earlier one it is only Isaac Luria who identifies the woman and the Shckhina, while in the later one R. Berukhim himself recognizes her. :-"lext, R. Safrin quotes the S~fer IJaf:/~wmol ("Book of Visions") of



The Shckhina as MaLl!Jid and Vision 215
l;Iayyim Vital, which reports a vision of a radiant woman b~' that chief disciple of lsaac Luria. R. Safrin quotes d1CSC ~nes from the Scfer Imfjt:ZyotUJt: Vital saw ~a dignified woman ( isba '!llJblll'tJ), and she was beautifullikc the sun. stand in front of me. and she said to me: 'What is it. my son l:layyim, why art' you crying?

Help me to sec the :s'amc [i.e.• GodJ. blc:sscd be He. sitting on the throne. the Ancicnt of Days. whose beard is white like snow. and who is majestic without end ... :~ Here R. Safrin omi[5 a major part of the Story, and continues at the point where God Himsc:lf addresses Vit:tl, s:I~.jng to him: ··l:Iayyim. my son .. :" whereupon R. Safrin's quotation brero off Although the quote from Vital. as prc:scnted by R. Safnn. docs not say explicitly that the radiant woman was the Shekhina. the \'ery fact that Safrin II1SCru this qUOtation among others that t:tlk about the appearances of the Shekhina indicates that he interpreted the appanrion as the Shckhina. Also. no other woman but the Shekhina could help a person sec God. Checking l:Ia~")'im Vital's Book ofVisums l5 I found that R. Safrin quoted mher inaccuratel~' c....·en the small part of Viral's \.jsion he reproduced. Viral gu'cs a lengthy description of a d~ he had In the night of Saturday. the 8th ofTe\'eth. 1566,10 whICh he saw a high mountain \\;th 1[5 head reach· Illg mto hea\"(.'n. and the I)rophct Elijah took him. in a Hash.

~ow Elijah appears ag3.in and rakes Viral to 3 wondrous place. a mJra.culous g3rden. where Vital sces the souls of s3.imly men in the shape of g~ studying the Talmud. In the middle of the g:lrden Vital St-CS 3. huge building flooting in the 3ir. with 3 ladder leading lip to it. Elijah :lgain disappears. :lnd, Vit31 continucs.

Arise. why do you fall Oil your face? Fear not. "
Finally Vital entreats God to let him stay with Him. but God says that his time has not yet come and he must rcturn ro CarID.16 As we sec. Viral's own account of his dream yision docs not identify the woman he sees as the Shekhina, a1mough herc tOO there arc hints as to
the divine nature: and powers of the wom~ whom Vital at first takes to be his mother. R. Safrin's alleged quote from Vital to the effect that Vital entreated his mother to help him sec God is not contained in the original. One must assume either that R. Safrin had before him :1 different manu· script of Vital's StIer "afJez.yonot, or that he did not remember it correctly and anributed to it statements nOt found in it. Bcfore returning to R. Safrin's account of visions of the: Shekhina I wish to refer ro one other mention of the Shekhina cOlllallled in Viul's book. In one of his dre:1ms Vital finds himsclf at the burial of J\-loscs. and in his dream. he says. ~I was sad and very troubk-d. in my hean. and said: '0 if I only could merit now ro sec the radiance of the Shckhina who shields Moses. peace be upon him. and stands here with us....

The Shckhina as Maggid and Vision 21 7
To come back now to R. Safrin. he next refers brieAy to a \;sion of the Shekhina had by "the saint. our master the rabbi Levi Yit7l:laq [of Berdi· d1C\']": "On the night of Sh:wu'ot he was granted a vision of the Shekhina, in the shape, etc. And she said to him: 'Be strong. my son w'i Yi[Z~aq! Many pains ha\'e you endured, but be strong. my son, for I shall be with \'01.1. Fear not and be nor afraid ....'" A different type of Shekhina vision was seen, according to R. Safrin, by R. Ya'aqov Shimshon of ShcpctO\'ka: 38
\Vhcn he was in the Holy Land. he saw the Shekhina in a \·ision. crying and mouming over the husband of her youth, for she had
a husband and he died. And he IR.

R. Sarrin's own visions of the Shckhina are recorded by him in twO different \'crsions. His bookM:tJillll[ S'tanm ("Scroll ofMystcries") eontains accounts of no less than three visions he had of the Shekhina. On one occasion. he writes.
In the middle of the day, while I \Va... studying the Gemara Yehamat, for the sake of the G<xl of Eternity lEI 'O/aml. to adorn the Shek· him wim all my Strength, suddenly a great tight fell ("lIfol] upon me. and the whole hOlise was filled with light, with a wonderful light. from the inspiration of the Shekhina. This was the first time that I tasted a linle of His light. blessed be He. truly. without mistake and confusion. in a wonderful pleasure. a very, very sweet light which no thought can encompass.
On another occasion, R. Samn writes, "On the e\"e of the hol~" Sabbath I dreamt a long dream, and in it [was] the explanation of Psalm 23, 'The Lord answer mt.'e in the day of trouble: And the essence of the pain was about the limbs of the Shekhina. dad in [his pain ... :' ~ l In a third entry R. Safrin writes:
The 20th of 'Orner, 5605 [1845 J. I was in the town of Duqla. am\'ed there in the middle of the night and in darkness. Thert.' was

R. Safnn reponed of his visit to Duqla in greater detail in his ,\I 'ttl' J\1tt::ay,td:.iJa, m a third· person narr:l[]\'e. After he ~fa.imed and fdl asleep.~ he S:lW the Shekhina

R. Safrin's descriptions of his visions are ~lg11lficant more for what they do not say than for what mc.:y do.

~-\s far as R. Safrin pc:rsona.lly is concerned. his "isionary experiences arc an expression of his II1teme preoccupation with the Shekhina and with Jil/ltdim-this is readily apparent from man~' passages in his books. He says, for instance. mat me eRect of a simpk act of a rZlUidiq, slIch as smoking a pipe::, was believed to bring about me unification of God and the Shekhin3. He quotes R. Ya'aqrn' Yoscf of fblonnoye to the effect mat when the Sa'al Shem Trn' smoked his pip<:, in each and every mo'.ement of his he effected ""awesome unifications.~ And of R. Zc,; of Zhidachey he reportS that he brought down the Shekhina by merely ""smoking the pipe::. with all the unifications he perfornlcd at mosc times."'" We conclude this rapid and of nccessity sketchy presentation of me Shekhina as ma.B!Jid and "ision with a report of the quite unusual anitude to the mllggid phenomenon displayed by Elij:lh, the Gaon of Vilna ( 17201707). Although the Gaon of ViIna W:1S a militant opponent of Israel Sa'a1 Shem To" and of Hasidism, he was a deyotcd student of the Zohar, was a Kabbalist. and in his adolescence e,'en had a \;sion of -an image" which made him desist from trying to create agoltm.*5 The Gaon's mOSt important disciple, R.l:fayyim ofVolo7.hin (1749-1821 ). writes aoom him that ~Hca\"cn wanted to deli\'er unto him supreme mysteries ... through mftl{!Jidim, masters of mysteries and [hcavcnly] princes of the Tora [i.e., different kinds of angels ]. but he did not desire it; it was offered to him. bur he refused it. 1
heard from his holy mouth mat many rimes "ut.!J9idim from HI.::an:n aPlx:arcd to him. requesting to deliver untO him the mysteries of the Torn without anv effort, but he would not hearken umo them." Once, howe"er, it so happe::ned that despite the Gaon's refusal, the Prophet Elijah visited him and "'re\'cakd to him great and awesome things.~"" With me spread of the HaskRJa, me Jewish Enlightenment. the religious amlosphere in which most Jews lived was no longer conducive to eimer maggidic experiences or visions of the Shekhina. Yet despite the diminution signified by this development, one feature. introduced originally by the Kabbalists, sur\"I\'ed in wide segments of the Jewish communi[)" and today still fornls an integral part of their religious services. The feature I am referring to is the recital of yU!udim, whieh we have discussed in tht- preceding chapter.

cnd('d up as the consort ~fGod himself. The main fcat~n:s of Lilith's mythical biography first appear in Sumerian culmrc 3bom the middle of the 3rd millennium R.CF.. \'Ilh:u she meant for rhe Biblical Hebrews can onl~' be surmised. but by the Tllmudic IX'nod (2nd-5th centuries CE.) she was a fully dcn.'\op<.·d {'\'il she-demon. and during the Kabbalistic age she rose to the high position of qu("Cnly consort at God's side.

The earliest mention of a she-demon whose name is similar to rhat of Lilith is found in the Sumcri:m king list which dates from ca. 2400 8.C.E.

eplcGi[qamcsiJ and the Hlllltpplt "Irte (chting from ca. 2000 B.C.E. ), Lilith (Lillakt.:) built her housc in the midst of the Huluppu (willow) trec which hJ.d been planted on the bank of the Euphrates in the days of Creation. A dragon set up its nest at the base of thc tret.', and tht.' Zu·bird placed his young in its crown. Gilg:ullesh slays the dragon with his huge brom.C" axe, whereupon the Zu-bird flec.s with its ~'ollng to the mountain, and Lilith, rcrror-strickcn, tears down her house and escapes to the desert:' A Babylonian rerra-eotta relict: roughly contemporary with the above poem, shows in what foml Lilith was bclieyed to appear to human eyes. She is slender, well-shaped, beautiful and nude. with wings :md owl-fet.'t. She stands l'rect on tWO reclining lions which arc fUmed away from each other and are flanked by owls. On hcr head she wears a cap embellished by SC\'('r:11 pairs of horns. In her hands she holds a ring-and-rod combination.s E\"idenrly, this is no longer :1 lowly she-demon, but :1 goddess \\ ho tames wild beam and, as shown by the owls on the relief:., rules by night. (Sc.:e Pbte 31 .) In the ensliing centuries Lilith's shap'-' changed again. A 7th-cenfUry B.CE. tablc..-r IOllnd at Arslan lash in northern Syria shows her as a wingni sphin.x, across whoS(.' body is written the following inscription in Phocni(·iJ.n-C:l.Ila:mite dialect:
0, Hyer in a dark chamtx'r, Go away at once, 0 Lili !
These lines arc pan of an incantation tcxt used to help women in childbirth "-one of many extant from the period of the Assyrian Empire and the new Babylonian Kingdom - and they show that by that time the m~'th of Lilith had all the major features which \\ere dabor.ltoo to their fill 2,000 years later by Kabbalistic Jud:1ism.

The rdatin:'ly scanty Talmudic materi:tI about Lilith is complemented b~' much richer data contained in Aramaic incantation texts found



Lilith 225
in ;-';ippur in Babylonia, some 50 miles southeast of modem Hilla in Iraq. Exca\'ations condul"tcd by the University of Pennsyh'ania brought to light dozens of bowls inscritx.'d with magic:lI texts. several of which are dirl."C[ed against Lilith or Liliths, The bowls date from about 600 C.E.; in other words, they arc about a hundred years younger than the text of the Baby· Ionian Talmud (which \\'as compiled ca. 500 CE. ), Bm there is every reason to assumc that such inc:mtations against Lilith w(.'re not me product of the 6th Cl'llNl')' but go back to earlier periods. In :,,\ippur of thc 6th CC11tul')', there \\'as an impon:mt Jewish colony (in addition to Mandaeans and other group~) , and some of me most interesting bowls were, by their own incon· trovcnible cvidence, inscribed and used by Jews, While the Talmud contains the ncws of the \cam("d dite about Lilith. these bowls show whar she memt tor the simpk people. It is surprising to $Ce to what CXtCnt thc sages md tht' quacks shared the fear of Lilith and mc belief in hcr e\'il nanm.', From a synopsis of the in("a.nration texts it appear; that Lilith was regarded as the ghostly paramour of men and con~titl.lted a special danger for women during: many p<.'riods of their scxu3.llife cycle: before defloration. during menlltruation, etc. A mother in the hour of childbirth and her ne\\'born babe were especially mlnerable, md therefOr(' had to be protected fr0111 the Liliths, The home. arches. md thresholds were favorite haunts where the Liliths lurked ready ro pounce on anybody foolish enough ro go unprOtectcd. A rough drawing sketched on a Jewish bowl shows Lilith naked, with long loose hair. pointed bream. no wings, strongly marked genitals. and chained ankles. At night, the female Liliths join men, and the male Lilin women, to generate d('monic offSpring, Once they succeed ill attaching themselves ro a human. they acquire rights of cohabitation, and therefore must be given agu, or letter of dimrce, in order that they may be expelled. Jealous of the human mates of their bedfellows. they hate thl' children born of o rdinal')' human wedlock. attack them. plague them, suck thcir blood, and strmgle them. The Liliths also manage to prevcnr thc birth of ch Lldren by causing barrenness. miscarriages, or complications during childbinh. As lvlomgomel')' aptly put it o\'er half a century ago, "the Liliths were the most developed products of the morbid imagination-of the bar· ren or neurotic woman, the mother in me time of matemity, the slecpless chiJd." 15 Let us now tum ro a fcw examples illustrating the manner in which [hese magic incantation!> arc phrased. The first is the text of me bowl which carries the skt."tch of Lilith described aba.'c (Sc..'C Pi:lte 32 ), Ir re-:Kis as follows:

The efficacy of the ritual is ensured by reciting the first occurrence of a similar rite, performed by a m~'thical hero. in this case the prophet Elijah.

71Lilith and Adam
As noted above, the older sourees do not State- cJt'arly that it \\'3S Lilith herSC'lf who. afte-r her Red Sea sojourn, re-turned to Adam 3S his ~uccuba. The btl:r sources, however, know it for a fan that mis. indeed. did happen. Ad3ll1, we read in the Zohar. sllcceed('d in impregnating Lilith during their early shon-li\'ed connubium~ then. not having been a suit:tble helpmeet for him. Lilith left him,J3 to rerum after a whit<: and force herSC'lf upon him. Before doing so, however, she managed to attach herself to Cain and to bear him numerous spirits and demons_3" The first medieval source (0 give the myth of Lilith and Adam in full was the lost Midrash Abkir (ca. 10dl cemury), which was followed by tht' Zohar and bter Kabbalistic writings. Adam. we learn, was a pcrfe('1: saint. and when he understood that because of his sin-or. as a l~onKquenCt· of Cain's fratricide-death came into the world, he separated from Eve. slept alone, and fasted for 130 years. But Lilith, whose name is Pizna ..o-or, according to the Zohar, two female spirits, Lilith and ~aamah - found him, dc;ired his bc:aury, which was like that of the Silll disk, and lay with him. The issue of thesc unions were demons and spirits, called "the plagues of mankind," who lurk underneath doorways or in wells and latrines, and lead men astl":1\'.41 According to the mythical cosmology of the Gcrnlan-born Palestinian Kabbalist Naphtali Herz ben Jacob El~anan (lived in the sccond half of the16th ce-nmry), in the Kcond of the sc\"cn earth-layers. counting from tht' bottom. dwell
the giant human figures. rall of stature, who w<.·re born of Adam in the 130 years during which he begm demons. spirits, and Lilin.

That Adanl begor with Lilith spirits, demons, and Lilin txx:ame a com· monplace in the mysticallitcrarure of the 14th to 17th cenmrics, often with me added explanation that it was Adam's own sin which made it possible for Lilith to O\'C'rcome him against his wilLH

recounting, or at least (eferring [0. a validating myth. Rdcrcncc to the old m~1h about Lilith and the three angels is all that is needed in order to endow the aporropaic measure with unfailing potency. The myth of Lilith the child-killer remained a potent f:letor in rhe lives of the tradition-bound Jews down to the 19th century. To proteCT rhe newborn !x)y-child against Lilith. they would draw a circle with natron or charcoal on the wall ofm(' birth room and write within it: "Adam and En.', OUI Li1ith~" At the sam,' time. the\' would write the names of thl" three angels Scno~', S:msenoy. and Scmmgdof on the door of the room: So
If children laugh in their sleep. or if they hugh while they arc awake but alone. this is 3. sign showing th:lt Lilith is pbying with them, :md especially when rhis happens on the night of thl' new moon. \\'hOC\'er notices that they laugh will do well to tap them on their noS(.' with his finger and say: "Go hencr.:, Pclonith [i.r.:., Lilith], you haw no portion or inhr.:ritance herr.:. you have no satisfaction here!" Thm let him recife rhe entire 'lVibi 1I0'a/1/' prayer, and do thus three times.. ~
Solomon's dominance O\'('r Lilim. which became an integral part of medir.:val Jewish and Muslim Arab demonology, retained all important role in M iddle E;btern Jewish exorcisms as rr.:cently as the early 20th century. Raphael OhJ..lla writes in hi:. collection of magical remedies:
In another manuscript book I found written the following: Prorection from Lilith. Draw a Seal of King Solomon, fX'ace be upon him, who :adjured Lilith that when she would sec his scal she and hcr cohorts would A('e, and that sh(' would ha\'c no pcmlission to hurt him. And if it be placed on a housc, she wOllld not enter it. ncither she nor anyone of her band. If it be cngr:a\'ed upon pure silH:r, it is e\'en bcrrer. And rhis is its shape:: ~ [Sec Figurr.: 3.]
The same magic Seal of Solomon pro[(.'crs also rhe sick against Lilith. if it is a5Cr.:rtained that it is she who caused rhe ailmenr. ~9 The same book contains tWO further suggestions as to mC"thods one can employ in o rder to safeguard a woman from Lilith:
If you pla.ce a needle close to the \\;ck in the lamp which I:. in the house of the woman in childbed. she will be safe from the entry of Lilith. Also. if she take the measure which is u.-.cd to measure the wheat, and place it close to the bcd, and if Lilith i:. there, she will sit on that measure and will not mo\"e from her pbce until

Lilith can hc~those whom she favo(S-or gain mastcty0\'Cr h~o rise \

introduced into this mythology is Qaftzcfoni. me Prince and King of HC3\'CIl.
whose wife is Mehetabel. the daughter of Matrcd.1l The daughter of this mYSTerious couple is Lilith the Younger. There seems, however, to be some confusion between Lilith the Younger and Lilith the Elder, because it is the Iam-r who i~ calk-d. Tzc:fonit ("'Northerner"), which would make her, and not: Lilith the Younger, the daughter of Qaftzcfoni:
Know that all the jealousy and altercation tx..tween the Princes of Quarrel and the Princes of Peace ... is on account of Samael and Lilith who is called Northerner (Tzcfonit), as it is written "Our of the North, the E'11 One shall break forth"'« Both of them {Samac! and Lilith] were born in a spirirual birth as androgynes, corresponding to Adam and Eve-below and above m'o m'in figures. And Samael and Lilith the Elder, who is the same as T v:fonit, arc referred to as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.
The same mid· 13th ccorury author, Isaac Hacohen, also assertS that "on rare occasions Qaftzcfoni couples with, and adheres to, and 100'es a creaNre whose name is Lilidtha,'" who in a mysterious way resembles Hagar tht' Egyptian; bur whether this Lilidtha is identical with Qaftzcfoni's own daughter, Lilith the Younger, cannot be cstablishc..-d. Now, Lilith thc Younger became the wife of Ashmodai, King of the demons, and OUt of this union sprang the great prince Harba diAshm'dai ("Ashmodai's Sword, . who rules O\'er 80,000 demons of destruction and numerous other demon offspring. Howcver, "'Lilith the Younger, who has the fornl of a beautiful woman from head to na,'eI, and from the navel downward is Aaming fire-like mother, like daughter-" aroused the desire of Samac!. This caused intense jealousy bctw(.'Cn Samac! and Ashmodai, as well as constant fighting between Lilith the Younger and Samad's wife, Lilith the Elder.86 Some three centuries after Isaac Hacohen, Moses Cordo\'ero ( 15221570). a leader of the Safed Kabbalists, reteUs the myth of the two Liliths with the addition of a f(.·w interesting details: Lilith the Elder. he says, has



248 The Hebrew Goddess
480 bands of demons under hcr command, thc number being derived from the numerical \'aiuc of the letters L Y L Y T (30, 10, 30 ,10,400) ffi:lking up the name Lilith. On the Day of Atonement. Lilith the Elder marches Ollt into the desert and, being the demon of screeching- hcr name taken
as ifderived from the verb Y L L, "'to scream" - spends the day there screaming. Samacl, however, also has J. concubine named Ma"alath, the daughter of IshmaeL'· who has 478 bands of demons at her disposal-again the
letters of her n3mc give the due to this number (1\ 1 l:i L T = 40, 8, 30, 400)- and "she goes and sings J. song :md a paean in the Holy Tongue. And when the [\,'.'0 meet. they fight. on the Day of Atonement. dlcrc in [he desert, and they taunt each other, until their voices rise to heaven. and the earth tn:l1lblcs under their screams. And all this is brought aoout by God so that they should not be able to make accusations against Israel [on the Da\' of Aronemem}.. .. .Lilith the Younger is helped in her tight against Lilith the Elder by her own mother Mehctabcl.!!.8 The mythological motif of cnmity bctwl.."Cn Lilith and ncr fellowdcmoncsscs. and the resulting ad\"aJltage for Israel on the Day of Atonement, is treated by other 16th·century Kabbalists as well. Abraham Galante (died 1560 or 1588). an important Safed Kabbalist and contemporary of l"loscs Cordovcro. recounts the entire Story of the annual encollmer in the desert ocr-ween Lilith and MaJ:!alath. but givcs a somewhat different characterization to one of the two chief she·demons: ,\1aryalath. according to him. is shO\m by her name to have tx:t.TI a compulsive dancer: as she marches into the desert ar the head of her bands of destructivc angels. ~shc goes and dances and gyrates in ring d:mces'" until she and Lilith f:IiI urxm each other and engage in a fierce bank.1IY Lilith's bands. and presumably Lilith herself as well. were imagined in rhis period as being covered with hair from head to foor. including their faces. but as having a bald pare. Their fourteen names. derived directly from the older incantation tott.'lO arc: lilin. Abito. Abim. Amo(z)rpho. Haqash. Odam. (I)Kcphido. Ailo. T.'ltrota.. Abniqra. Shatrina., Kalubtz.a.. Turoi. Pirtsha.91 But, to rerum to t~e nvo Liliths: this idea is put fon.vard in a different fonn by }:Iayyim Vital (1543-1620), a Safed Kabbalisr and chief disciple
of Isaac Luria. He explams marthe original ~Lilith the stiff-necked" was
the -garb," {nat-is, thCShclr,me outer and evilE.,art, of E, c. me wife of K Adam. But hcg~ on to say, ...t.herels an even more extem:tl [i.e.. more evil) Lilith. who is the \\,ift:: of Samad.~ In the sequel it is not clear whether
Vital speaks 01 the first or die second Lilith when he says thar "'there was an angel who was expelled from hea\'en and he was called 'the flanle of the

And since the female rules at night, and the demons rule at night, she is called Lilith" [i.e., NocrumaJ).'n The notion th:lt Lilith rules:lf night goes back to me Zohar, where the Biblical cxpn."SSion ~drC:ld in me nights~ (pni.md ba-ldoth)'H is cxplainc..-d as "S:unacl and his f("malc,~ i.c., Lilith.~ What is more interesting in VitJ.l's thinking is that he regarded Lilith and tilt: angel as interchangeable, a... appearing once in the shape: of one and once as the other. made tangible by the Aamc of the re"oh-ing sword. We shall «..call that in the 6th-century C.E. Nippur incantarion texts the same numen is called once "Lilith BUUlai" and once ~angcl BU7.Jlai,...... which is y<..'T anomer example of the great anriqui~· ofsome of the ideas put fonvard by the mcdie\'al Kabbalists. The same idea underlies a passage eOIUJ.incd in the Zoharic literature itself which reads: "Come and see: The Shekhina i~ at times called the Mother, at times the Sla\·e-Womanlre ., Lilith l, and at times the King's Daughter:'Q~ ill other words, circumstance~ determine wIiCtFiCrone and the same
fcmi~ivine essence assumes tne fo~f a good or an eV11 numen. And.
sinc;:cm,::umsranccs ('ollSt;lntiy change, me gooacss appears o nce as good and once as evil. In a ditferent formulation of the idea, Lilith appears as rhe "'nakedness" oftne 'Shckhina, that aspect of her which prcponderat~ in 1M period of Israel's exile: "When Israel \\'3.~ exiled, the Shekhina tOO went into exile, and this is the nakedness of the Shckhina.

14 IConclusion
It is rather difficult to evaluate the position of Lilith in Jewish religion. and her significance for the Jewish believer. The very fact thJ.[ as late as the 18th, or even the 19th, century the belief in her nor only survived but remained a potem factor in religious consciousness and conduct is in ifS('lf surprising. That these beliefs and, in all probability, the practices as well retained essentially the same foml in which they first appeared 4,000 years pre"iously in Sumer is remarkable. A citi7.cn of Swner ca. 2500 R.C.E. and an East EuropeJ.n Hasidic Jew in 1880 C.E. had \'el)' little in common as fur J.S the higher levels of religion were concerned. But they would have readily recognized each other's beliefs J.bout the pernicious machinations of Lilith, J.nd each other's apotropaic measures for driving her away or escaping her enticements. Ir is interesting. mon."O\'er, to note that both in ancient Sumer and in Kabbalistic Judaism Lilith's career ran very similar COUfscs. She started our in both faiths as a lowly she-demon. whose acri"ities were confined to the nether realms of existence. who was J.Ssoci:ned with impure nocturnal :lni· mals, and who puUed man down to her base level. Then. in both religions,



252 The Hebrew Goddess
she slIcceeded in working hcrself up. as it were, to higher nmgs on the scale of numina. umil she became m undoubted goddess in Sumer and the consort of God in Kabbalism. Yet \\;th all mese adv:ll1ecs in her e:JIeer, the basic qualitics of her personality nC\'er changed: she remained the be':lUtiful seductress who joined londy men in thl..'ir nocturnal unrest, enjoyed sex with them. and bore thl..'m demonic offspring, whilc she also lound enough time to play her lethal games with childrcn, causing them to laugh happily in their sleep and then strangling them mercilessly so as to get hold oC and array herself in. their innocent souls. There can be linle doubt that a shedemon who accomp:ll1ied mankind-or:l.t least a part of mankind-from earliest antiquity to thc threshold of thl..' Age of Enlightenment must be a projection, or objcctification, of human feaN and desires which, in a deeper sense. are identical with those of oft-mentioned ~plagues of mankind~ said in Kabbalistic liter-mm: to be the oftspnng of Lilith. but rc.·cognized by us as hcr psychogenic progenitors. The meaning of Lilith becomes more ea...ily comprehensible if one con· siders the b;tiic similariry bem'een her and the Marronit. the goddess of rhe Kabbala. whose image was described and analyzed in a previous chapter. Lilith. of course. is the embodiment ofeverything that is e,ij and dangerous in the sexual realm. while the j\htronit is her exact opposite: a good, ewn saintlv figme. Yet, at the same time. Lilith is also irn:sistibh- anracti\·e. while
the j\tat~onit is stemly forbidding and even warlike. A ~loscr look easily discems th,· mask·nature of these contrasting charactcri7.:ltions: behind the e,·il mask of Lilith .md the good one of the Matronit. the numen, emhOO.· ying man's fears and desires, is disconcertingl~'. yet reassuringly, [he same. Her mythical biography, whether it treatS her as Lilith or as the Matronlt, remains fundamemally unchanged: Both the M:uronit (who is identic:ll with the Shekhina) and LIlith originated. according [0 the Kabbalistic docrone. from an emanation of the deity. We also recall the virglllity of th,' Matronit. Lilith. tOO, is a \·irglO. or at least as...umes at \\'ril the bodily tarm of a \'irgin when she joins the couch of a sleeping man who embraces her in his ullconsciou... dc..ire. Both the j\btronit and Lilith arc, on the other hand. promisclloll.'>: no sooner i... a man separated. e,'cn temporarily. from his wife than the Matronit joins him. couples with him, and thus rcstort:S him to thal state ofcompletene.ss which is the privilege and high blessing of the male and female together. Lilith docs thl..' same, with the difference. of course, that in contrast to the hoi\' union of man and thl' Matronit, the union which LiJitll enters imo with man is an unholy defikmcm. Both the Matronit and Lilith arc queell.'>: the ~htronit, me hea\enly queen of Israd; Lilith, the queen of Sheba and :z.cmargad.

THE SABBATH
VIRGIN, BRIDE, QUEEN, AND GODDESS
The Sabbath, ro which we now rum our :mcntion, is an exceptional figure among the female di\>initics of Judaism. All the numerous images discussed SO far were originally either foreign goddesses and demons (Ashcrah. Asrane. Anath, Lilith, Naamah) or had their beginnings in Jcwish divine attributes which were conceptualized and personified (Shckhina, M:uronit). As against them, the Sabbath is a unique example of a day of the week -or more precisely. the name and idea of such a day- having bern developed into a female numen and endowed with the char:lctcr of virgin. bride, queen, and goddess.
1 ISabbath and Sex
The Biblical name Sabbath (Slmbbat).dcsignating the scventh day ofthe w(."Ck, seems to have had some connection with the Akkadian shabatw or shapattll, the name for the fcast of the full moon. Yet neither in Akkadian nor in :m~' other ancient Near Eastern religion was there a weekly feast and da~' of resr in any manner comparable to the Sabbath. From 3 p:lSS3gC in Dcurero-IS3iah we learn in what way one was supposed to observe the S3bb3rh in [he c3dy post-cxilic period:
255

And I shall make you ride high Upon the hills of the c:mh And I shall feed you with the heritage Of your father JacobFor the mouth of Y:mwch has spoken. L
The ,h3r3crcr and laws of the Biblical Sabbath an: \'alidatcd by the
myth of Creation: Goo created the world in six da~'s, and on [he ~vcnrh, the Sabbath. He rested; He bl~d and :.anctificd it, and consequcntl~· it is the dut\' of e"ery Israelite to do likewise and to refrain from all work on
that holy day. ~ With the passage of time. the rcsrricti\"c Sabbath IJ.ws became more and more stringent. By the 1st century C.E.. in some Jewish com· munities scxual intercourse was included among the actS prohibited on tht' Sabbath, under the penalty of death,l While this prohibition \\'a:. unable to take root in Judaism (in which, on the contrary, the idea was soon to de\'elop that intercourse with one's wifc on Frida~' night was a sacred duty), it lx.'ome an important law in sc\'cral marginal Jewish sectS sllch as the Samaritans, the Karaites, and the Falashas,+ In Talmudic Judaism the performance of the marital act on Friday night was considered a very old religious law. According to a Talmudic tradition. one of the ten ordinances inrroduced b~' Ezra was that one should cat garlic on the e\"c of the Sabbath. tx.'cause garlic makes one happy. multlphr.=s the :>eOlen. arouses 100"e. and kills iealollsy"~ Some sagcs anributed such importanCe to the perfonnance of the act on Friday night that nothing was supposed to keep them from it. A legendary refk'"ction of this is found in a Talmudic Story which tells of Yehuda ben f:ijyya that he used to spend all his time in the house of study and rerum home only on the en: of the Sabbath, W1l!.:m:.'\'er he thus went home, a pillar of fire could be seen preceding him. One Friday. however. he became so engros:>cd in hi:. studies ti13[ he forgot about the rime and remained poring O\'cr hi!> books, When his father-in-law. Rabbi Yannai. waited in vain for thc appearance of the pillar of fire, he said: "Tum O\'er hi:. bed, for Yehuda must be dead. Would he be ali\'e, he would ne\'er have neglected his marital duty." These words

had the cfli.-a of a command issuing b" mistake from the mourn of a mler.
which is carric."'ci out ocfore he ean~ r~ind it. and at that instant Yehuda died." Thus. a~ far as sexual intercourse on me Sabbath is concemed. the \'iew that developed in the mainstream of traditional Judaism was diametrically op~d to that held, or to be held later. in severnl semi· Jewish sects. As we shall sec in the course of (his chaprer. Kllbbalism. building o n the tra· ditional Jewi:.h vie\\', developed its own approach. which endowed the perfonnance of m3.nul intercourse on the Sabb3.th with a special cosmic significance and mml."'<i the S3bb:uh Itself into a vcritable di\ine queen. the bride of God Himself
2 J77Jc Sabbath of Phil.
Philo's comments on the $3bb:uh begin with 3 discus~ion of the significance o f the number 5('\·en. He refers to the old Pythagorean com· rarison of the numbers with gods and. in p3rtieular. to the likening of SC\'en to the virgin goddess Athena. ~ and utilizes il in hi:. al.Iegorical explan3tion of the sacfl"'<incss of the Sabbath. me sc\'cnth day.l'ne number scn:n, Philo pomt~ out. is the only one in tllt: "decade" (i.e" the first ten digits) which is nCJther produced by multiplication with any other number nor produces one within the dec3de if multiplied by another. And, he goes on to say, ~by reaM>1l of thi:.. the P~"{hagore:ms. indulging in myth. liken $(.'\'en ro me motherless and e\'l:r·virgin Ma.iden [i,e ,. Adlen3 j, tx...causc neither \\'3:' :.hl" born of the womb nor shal.l she ever bc3r,~H Elscwhere Philo say:. th3t since

This rich symbolism of tht· numhcr scven is rr3l1sferred by Philo in its
entin·ty to the se\'cruh day of rhe week. the Sabbath. We arc lefT in doubt as to wht,ther thb 3pplic3tion was the idea of Philo himself or whether it origmatoo with others. One of the tWO pas:.agcs in which Philo discusses the symboli:.rn of dle Sabbath is explicitly stated ro be 3 mere recording of what others have invented; the other is phrased so as to indicate that it

prnods.
31The Talmudic Amecetiellts
In the Bible, the prohibition of working on the Sabbath is stated in gcncrll tcmlS only. In the 1\1ishna and the Talmud, all the activities which COUnt as work, :lOd therefore 3rc prohibited on the Sabbath, arc cnumcran.-d :1I1d discussed. In considerable dctail,ll There can thus be no doubt that to the Talmudic period the Sabbam was of primary imponancc as th(' weekly day of rest. hallowed by God and observed by men with meticulous scrupulousncss. as one of the pivotal religious duties of Judaism. Y("t. in addition to all the legalistic detail. there is one single passage in Talmudic litcrarurc which indicates that the personification of the Sabbadl as a bride and a queen dates back to the Talmudic times (the two sages mentioned in the passage in question lived in the 2nd and 3rd cenrurit!S CE. ):
Rabbi Hanina used to wrap himself [in ft..'Stive clorhcsJ towards e,'ening on Friday and say: "Come. let us go to receive Sabbath the Quccn,n Rabbi Yannai used to pur on [fcstive] clorht!S on the CVI.' of the Sabbath and say: "'Come. 0 bride, come. 0 bridc!~ 13
Other Talmudic passages, while not addressing the Sabbath as a bride or a queen. clearly show that the sages of thc Talmudic period related with extraordinary lo\'e and affection to the Sabbath day, Sa~'ings such as ~He who takes three meals on the Sabbath will be sa,'ed from three e\'ils: the
pangs of the Messiah, the judgment of Gchcnna. and the war of Gog and Magog~ or "'He who celebrates the Sabbath with enjoyments will be gi\'cn an inheritance without bounds~ Ii express the spirit in which the Sabbath was regarded, Anecdotes about a pious man called "Joseph the Sabbath· Io-.er" arc adduced to illusrrate the rewards one can expeCt to reap if one lovcs and honors the Sabbath. IS The Sabbath I:' [ike the spice which endows the Sabbath meals \\'ith a delicious scem. 16 The importance of honoring the Sabbath with a fcsti\·c table is rept"arcdly emphasized. and onc sagc, Rabbi Yose ben Yehuda. a Palestinian reacher of the 2nd century C.E., had this to say about it:
Two ministcring angels accompany a man on Sabbath eve from
the s~nagogue to his house. One I:' a good angel. me othcr an (\,1 one. As the man arrives in his house. ifhe finds the candle burning, the table !iC..'t. :lnd his bed made. the good angel says: "Be it the

savs: "Rc it the: will that it Ix like this on the next Sabbath!" and the good angel answers "'Amen'" against his \,;1J.1
In a midrashic passage the Sabbath no t only is personified bur is confr.l(X>Sitcd to God:
Rabbi Shimcon ben Yo~ai said: The Sabbath said before God: "Master of the Worlds! Each day ha:. its matc, but I han- none! Why~" The Holy One, bkssc..-d be: He, answered her: "The Comffilmirv of Israel is \'OUr matc:' And when Isr:td stood befo re ,\ 1oom

The common feanlre between the Talmud's and Philo's \"lew of the Sabbath is th3t both personi!)' her as 3 woman: Philo makes her the nrgin d3ughter of God, who IS 31so the sovereign and ruler of the world; thc T31mud presents her 31' rhe bride of Isr3d :lI1d a quecn.

It is a peculiar. yet again almost inevitable, coincidence that the samc night on which the pious prepare to receive Queen Sabbath, and on which God Himself proceeds to unite with her, should also be the time when Lilith roams and seduces me:n. It is up [0 man. the passage quoted abm'e seems to say, [0 make his choice between the holy bride. the Sabbath, and me unholy one, Lilith. Ibpc. after quoting the foregoing two paragraphs in hi~ commentary to the Song of Songs. adds:
The passage. however. by implication. says even more than this. Patai, in his chapter on Lilith makes it ckar that she is none other than the e\'il 3Spect of the: same Goddess whose good side is the Matronit. The: mention of the worship of the Queen of Heaven. will aUtISm to Jer. 7:18,44:17-19. makes it dear that the reference is to the persistence of the old-time religion, the cult of the Great Goddess. older by millennia than the reYdation of the nanle of the God of Israel. The issue here is whether one performed similar rites in the name of the Queen of HC3\"Ct1., inanna-ishtar, Anat. Atargaris, Venus, or in the name of Yahweh and his Sabbath Bride.4l
Less than a hundred years after the Zohar. the idea of the Sabbath as God's bride and of God as the Sabbath's bridegroom, was elaborated and made explicit by Da\'id ben Joseph Abudarham, a commentator of the prayers and the benedictions. who IiYed in $cyille about the middle of the 14th century, In his exposition of this thought, Abudarham adduces {....·idence from the special Sabbath prayers, which he reads 3S alluding to the betrothal of the di\·ine couple. '"'The Sabbath;' he says, '"'is called bride, and



268 The Hebrew Goddess

In addition to this paean. in which rhe Sabbath is described as God's bride and God as tht" Sabbath's husband.

Ibpe. in his commentary to the Song of Songs. sumliscs that this Kabbalistic custom of receiving the Sabbath in the open followed
an ancimt custom of devoting th,' e"ening of Friday (Fri[g]day. Frig being thl' old Teutonic Jm'e-goddess corresponding to Venus) to "enereal acrh·ity... _The empha!>i!. on the open coumry and the fields outside thc town suggcSts alfresco amour under the benign glow of the Venus star (which helps one to wldnstand thc French expression for "'out·of-d()()rs.~ Ii In belle hoi/e, the beautiful star being Venus). The Bride and Qucen greeted at dusk in the open country around Safed. we mar pIJusi bl~· surmise, W.lS the epiphany of the E,"ening Star, Ishtar-Venus. Quc,'n of Heawn. The qucstion of thc Cantielc (8:5a): "Who is this ascending from the Stcppe~~ is thus answered" The vesper sonic into the field recalls the im-itation of the Canticle ( 7: 12-13): "Come. my Im"e, let us hie to the ficld ... there will I give you my lo\'e.
So far so good. But in the subsequent rwo senrenccs Dr. fbpc makes a surmise which forces us to part company with him:
The euphoria of thc procession :IS they marchcd to the field singing the hymn compoSl.'d by Solomon Alqabel7.. "'Come my 100·c to meet the Bride / The pr,"SCncc [face] ofSabb:uh let" us recei\·e.~ could lead to wlightheaded" activities if both sexes werc prescnt.

As far as one can conclude on the basis of whar we know of rhe life of the Saf,-d Kabbalists-and whether kamcd or not. all the Jews of Safcd werc Kabbalists in the 16th century-these Friday e,"ening cxcursions to



The Sabbath 271
the fields must have been purely :\ masculine affair. Thus me open coumryside, which mystically assumed the character of the "sacred apple orchard," could have been the scene of nothing morc than a highly emotional, but at the same rime purdy mystical-imaginary union bcrween rhe male partic' ipants in the procession, as rcprcscnratin~s of the Communi~' of Israel. and me Holy One. blessed be He. the Dh·inc Bridegroom of that community and of the Sabbath. The passage from the Song of Songs (8:5) quoted in this context hy Ibpc. "'Under the apple tree I aroused you, there your mother conceived you.~ ccnainl~' contributed its share to the dcvclopmcllt of the concept of me <'sacred apple orchard," and. as fupc poinrcd our (p. 192), may in rum have had someth ing to do with the old pagan worship in sacred grovcs. BlIt in the course of the more than tWO millennia that had
passed since mat Biblical seene, Jl"\ish sensibilities had txromc highly refined, so mat any kind ofgroup "celebration congenial [0 thc lovc Queen" would h;;I\'c been torally abhorrent to the l6rh-cenrury Kabbalist5. B>' that time, and especially in :I. Muslim environment such as represented by the town of Safed., the strict separation of the sexes h:l.d long been an entrenched and inviobre rule :l.mong the Jews. Public intenningling of men and women, whtwer in the syn:l.gogue, in the fields, o r elsewhere, was entirely out of the question. This communal emphasis on segreg:l.tion of the sexes meant th:l.t unmarried young mcn had to, and did. find outlets in clandt""Stine rebtionships or encounters with women. If and when such affairs became public knowledge, their least consequence was urfcr disgrace. While no accounts of rhe sexual behavior of the Safed Jews arc extant, there arc contemporary documents which aUow us to conclude that clandestine illicit sex was the most frcquent among thc transgressions for which a sinner was belie\'ed to incur the punishment ofgifgJII, or transmigration of his soul into the body of an animal or another human.so HO\\'l""Cf", clandestine offenses against an oppressively severe scxual code arc one thing, and public sexual celebrations arc quite another. While we can thus be practically certain mat such group happenings could not, and did not. take placc, we have eve!")' reason to assume that in those Friday evcning excursions to the "'sacred apple orchard" there was a strong admixOlre of erotic clements and libidinous arousal, which did nOt lead to any sexual acti\'ity untillarer that night, howc\'cr. Since one of the focal endca,:ors in rhe religious life of the Kabbalists was to sanctify. by mystical interpretation, the kgitirrute sex"UJ.I. relations IXfwcrn husband and wife. whatl"1.."r libido may ha"e been aroused by the Friday c,"cning group celebrations in the open fields around Safed was channeled into mc licit and recommended s;uisfaction of marital sex after midnight,

They consist of two parts: an earlier one. explaining the mystical meaning of marital intercourse on Friday night; and J later one, specifying the mystical significance of rcstricting marital intercourse to Friday night after midnight. The first is found in the Zohar, which casts its teaching on the subject
into the form of a rcinrerpn.'t"ation of a passage in Isaiah : MThus saith the Lord concerning the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths. and choose the things that please Me. and hold fast to My cO\'enant: E\'en untO them will I gi\'c in Mv house and within Mv walls a monument and a memorial better than

The words "who keep My Sabbaths~ mean that those scholars keep themseh'cs waiting for the Sabbath. "'Choose the things that please Mc"
refers to the time of the coupling of the Matronit.

Isaac Luria, in his discussion of the relationship bcnvccn the King and the Marronit, whom he calls the Small Face and his Female. rcspccrivdy, diHinguishcs two facets or persons in the latter: one, referred to by the name Leah. representing the lower aspect of the Shekhina-Marronit and reaching only as high as the chest of tht~ Small Face; and the other, Rachel, the Shckhina's higher aspect, occupying a face-to-face position with the m:J.ic deity from his chest upward. The Small Face, incidentally, is also called Jacob or Israel when in juxtaposition to Leah and Rachcl. Thc Small Face is engaged during the day. and during the night up to midnight, in copulation with Leah which is, mystic:illy, of a low degret.·, From midnight on. on weekdays, and up to midnight o n Fridays, a higher type of copulation t;tkes place between the Small Face and Leah, After midnight on Frid3Y. the Small Face and Rachel copulate. which is the highest kind of union of the male and the female in the godhead, This. therefore, is the time of grace in which a scholar should unite with his wife. making sure that he docs so only after ha\'ing pronounced the words: " \ fulfill the commandment of copulation for the unification of the Holy One. blessed Ix: He, and the Shek.hina,~ <>3 Thus. for the Jew reared in the great mystical tradition of his faith. the Sabbath was a day whose: pkasures, both physical and spiritual. amply compensated him for the drabness, narrowness. and frequent sorrowfulness of the w,...ekdays, With th<.' Sabbath. a qut.-c:nly \'isitor entered t.'\'t-11 the humblest abode, which, due ro her presence. was transformed into a royal palace, with the table SCt. the candles burning, and the wine waiting. The mistress of the house became mysteriously identified with the Queen Sabbath, who was also identical wim the Shekhina.. the divine ,\'htronir, God's own consort. As for the master of the house, he felt his chest swell and his consciousness expand due to the "additional soul" which came down from on high to inhabit his body for the duration of the Sabbath. All these supemai presences made man and wife feci part of the great spiritual world order in which c\'cry act and word \\'as fraught with cosmic significance, and in which the supreme command of the day was "Rejoice!'" \Vhen midnight came, and the fulfillment of the commandment to rejoice on the Sabbath found its most intense expression in the consumm:uion of the marital act. this was done with the full awareness not only of obeying a di\'ine injunction. but also of aiding thereby the di\'inity himself in achieving a state of male-female togetherness which God is just as much in need of as man,

It is certainly a vcry far cry from the ancient Canaanite mass orgiastic festivals pcrfonncd in honor of Astarte, the goddess of sexual love and ft·rtility. to the mystically oriented and privltdy observed celebration of marit:!.1 sex in honor of the Sabbath. the divine queen :lnd consort of God. Yet, quire :'Ipan from the historic dcn:lopmenr which led from the first to the second in rhe course of nearly three millennia, ont" em discover in both at least one common feature which indicates their gcneric relatedness. Both obsc.:rvanccs arc rulrurall? condiOOIK-d and traditionally fonnularoo responses to the basic human psychological need to elevate and sanctify the 5Cxual impulse by attributing to the sex act a higher, a religious, a di"inc significance. In both, the act becomes more than the end-in-itself that in physiological reality it acrually is; it becomes a sacrosanct observance directed at a loftier and greater aim: the exertion ofbcncficial influence upon the great ultimate realities of the metaphysical world. And in both it is a female deity whose invisible yet omnipresent countenance is supposed [0 light up into a benign and pleasurable smile when she observes th<.' fervid pcrfomlancc of her favorite rite.

The foregoing cle"en chapters have nor discussed alt the feminine numlna who. in one period or another, played a role in the history of Hebrew and Jewish religion. There wcre, in addition to those trc:ucd, stich concepts as the '"Holy Spirif,~ closely akin to, yet distinct from, rhe Shckhina; the "Community ofTsr:lei," a personified guardian spirit ofthc [Orality ofthe jr.'wish pt.-''Op!<:; and "\Visdom, ~ God's earliest creation and playmare. who had hcr counterpart in the Greek Sophia; none ofthcsc received morc than fleeting mention abovc in various contexts.

divine being believed to possess a will of her own :md to be cap3ble of acting independently of any omer divine power. Such indc.'pendent mlirion and c.lpabiliry of action was 3nribuu.-d to all the goddesses discussed. In reference to the C3rly ones, thoSt: who CSt:l.blished themselves in the Biblical Hebrew religious consciousness, the question of their dependence on o r independence of Yahweh ne\'cr h3d to be faced up to SCJu3rdy. Asherah, Ast3l1e, and Anath, on thc one hand, :l.nd Y:t.hweh (or Yahweh Elohim), on thl.' orner, inhabited two separate realms.
Those who bdie\'ed in the goddesses S:l.W no incompatibility between me sway they held O\'er certain are3S of hwnan life and certain deparrmems of nature and the rule Yahweh cxerciS(.-d O\'cr others: in the polytheistic \'icw of the divine, gods may compete with. and occasionally conspire agail1Sl, one another, but they ne\'er cast a doubt on one another's existence. And 3S to those who belie\'ed in Yahweh only, for them the gods and goddc.s.scs worshiped by others were merely idols. devoid of any significance what· soewr. except the one baleful ability to lead men astray from me pam of righteousness. In the later period, [he female divinities occupit.-d a position in rcl3tion to God whieh was similar in one respect to that ofSat:l.n: rhey were cap3ble of independent thought and action - surpa~ing by far the autonomy of angels, who were belie\'cd to be ba.sicall~· no more than the instruments of God's will. Yet there Wa!>, of courM:, the fund:mlental antithesis betWct'fl good and evil which .separated the Cherubim 3nd the Shekhina from Satan and his cohorts. The independence of S3t3n's will from th3t of God was the n:sult of his rebellion against his M3Ster, and his opposition to God was alwlYs that of c\·il to goodness. Not so the female divinities, whose every independent 3Ct, (.'\"en if it brought them into conflict with God. stemmed from meir own, ditlcrellt. but cqU311y \·3.lid. will to gco:l The one exception [ 0 rhis rule is Lilith. the female embodiment of evil S3t3n's comp:mion, more de3dly than 3ny male de\-jl could e\'er be.

The most powerful 3rchangcls, un3blc to subdue her, could only Strike 3 b3rgam with her which left her 3mplc «x>m to pursue her nef3rious 3etivities. The world peopled br these goddesses is calculated no t only to repel [he orthodox believer in rhe one 3nd only God, but also to frustrate the logical mind. It is not unlike that old orchard of mysteries which the Talmud warns ag3inst c.oxplonng in the foml of me story about the four sages who "entered the Pardes," three of whom came to 3 b3d end.

If the female figurt· holding the infam Moses tn her arms IS not Anahita. who then IS she? Before seeking: the answer to this question, let us again SUfe clearly that pan of Goodmough's imerprct3tion which we J.C("epf. There ean be no doubt [hat th(" muralist did engage in what Goodenough ("ails a ~borrowing of foml:' In other words, he p:l.inted a female figure whose anributes and posture he borrowed from the ("Urrenr representations of Anahit:l.-Aphrodite. and he did this in order to pamt an image that could readil~' be n."<:ognizcd as a nwin( female. Once we ac("cpt that this was the artists's intention. we ("all easily understand wh~' he ~borrowed the fonn~ of Anahita-Aphrodite: simply because there was no other form :I\""lilablc to him in which [0 express the ide:t th:t( a. feminine deity cradled .\1oscs in hcr arms. In Jewish artistic tradition there was certainly no prowrypc for the pictorial representation of a divine female: in the gentile ('Il\ironmem of Dura.. it was almost cxdusl\"dy the Anahita-Aphrodite inuge that intruded upon the artist's consciousness.

Moses (Exodus 2:3 ), which undoubtedly had a rounded, blSkedike shape. \\'llat we sec instead is a rectangular box, with a rri:lngular g:lblcd roofm'cr its right end. The peculiar sh:lpe of the ark of bulrushes h:lS caught the :lttention of Goodenough, who conmlCntcd th:lf the ark is skcrched in :l mann('r doscl~' resembling the shape of the s:lrcoph:lguscs found, e.g., :It B(,th She:lrim, Israel. H is explanation is th:lt the artist inrended to indic:lte that Moses. rht: Redeemer, had died :lnd W:lS reborn 10 new life. Jl This cxpi;u1:ltion seems f:lrfetched to me, beC:lUSC we ha\'e no e\·idencc to show th:lt the Dur:l muralist was familiar with the gabkd sarcophaguscs or that rile idea of rile infantik death and rebirth of Mose~ (a non-Jewish mythologem) was known to him. A much closer comparison would be between the shape of the ark of bulrushes and that of the Temple shown twice on the same wall. In fact. the ark of bulrushes is painted unmistakably in the shape of a miniature Temple. Tht' same shape was given to the Torah shrine or Ark in most Jewish representations from the 1st to at least the 10th centuries CE . The oldest, found in the Jewish catacombs of Rome and dating from the Is[ to 4th centuries CE., show the Torah shrine :J.S precisely sueh a miniatun' Temple with a gabled roof In the Beth Alpha syr13gogue. a mosaic dating from the early 6th eentury CE. shows the Torah shrine in the same 10m}, as docs a picture in a 10th-century Pentateuch manuseript from Egypt:13 These exam· pies, which could easily be multiplied. indicate that there wa); :1 firnl tr:ldition in Jewish art to n.'presem the Torah shrme as a miniature Temple with a ga.blcd roof The lorah shrine. whose presence in any room mmed it into a srnagogu(" actuallv symbolized, represented, and substituted for the Temple of Jerusalem, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. In the Dura synagogue. the Torah shrine, or at least the niche in which it SH)(xL did not have such a triangular gabkd tOp but was capJX'd bv a rounded shell-like semidome. Corresponding [0 it. the Ark of the Co\'enant is also shown with such a shdl-shaJX"d rounded top. Ye[ this detail cannot alter the fact thar the ark of bulrushes is shown in the shape of a miniamrc Temple. and it most probably is symoolic of the T('mple or its predecessor, the desert Tabernacle. \Ve now recognize that just as the woman holding Moses in her arms represcms the lifelong association of Moses with the Shekhina, so rhe ark of bulrushes in the shape of a miniature Temple or Tabernacle hints at the greatest religious feat performed by Moses: the building of the Tabernacle, the Sanctuary that sen·cd as the prototype for all subsequcnt JeWIsh Temples in Jerusalem. '11e desert Sanctuary was called mlShkan ("dwelling") bc..-catlS{' Yahweh was believed to have "dwelt" (shakhan) in it or over it in a doud.M It is this idea ohhe "dwelling" (Shekhma) of Yahweh that in time de\'clopcd

'Ine 3rea from which the ]<.-\\'.. of Dura were willing fO accept cuinlr:ll influences is presented in rhe synagoglle murals as that of the pictorial n.:prcscnt:lrion of di\;ne, or qu:t..;;i-di\'ine. heroes in the Hdlcnisric style. ·Iltis is considerlbly more than a mere ~borrowillg. offor11l,~ bcC3USC it implies the asscrrion th:lt the Biblical heroes and other Jewish figures depicted in :l foml borrowed from Hdleniqjc represcntatioll3.1 an were, in fact. as close to being divine as were the Greek heroes or deities whose anributes were borrO\\'l'd for giving visual exprl's~ion to the divine quality of the kwish heroc~ and other figures. 'Ine oclieftlllT some Biblical and post·Biblil-:l1 heroes were ~upcrhuman and quasi·divine was an old Jewish tradition that went back to Biblical times and de\"Clopcd more fully in the posT·Biblie31 period. It was certainly an old. csnblished fcature of Jewish religion by the time the Dml mm:lls wen: p:linted. We .sa\\', above, soml' of Th" Midrashic traditions that surrounded the birth and infancy of Moses and [hat [ca\'c no doubt as to his quasi-divine charactcr in Tannaitic and Amor:lic belief. To them wc rna\' add the folio\\"· ing generali7..ations: the typical hero. whether he li\'cd in Biblical or post· I!iblical times, W:lS considered in thl' Talmudic (i,e" T:mnaitic a.nd Amoral(")

tradition as being gigantic in bodily size, widding superhuman strength, enjoying a much longer life-span thall ordinary mortals, possessing extraordinary wisdom and beauty, ha\·ing had (and prcTailed in) encounters with angels and demons, and having the power to mak(.' even God Himself ooc;' him.·'5 People who had this mental image of their own "god-men," when they learned about Greek gods and heroes, fdt no qualms owr borrowing the laners' tr::J.its and attributes when it came to cxprc...;;sing in visual fonn the divine qualities of a lvloses or a D:l\'id, or depicting the di\·ine female (or: the tCmak in the divinity), rhe Shekhina. As against this, the Jews of Dura were rOOTt·d fimlly enough in their Jewish rr:tditions not to allow the piCTorial representation of an~' pagan deity as such to intnlde into their place of worship. In all the pands of the Dura s~'nagogue rhne is not a single example of the representation of a pagan goo as such. \\!hat arc represented dearly and with lUlmistakable intem art· rhe local idols (i.e., statues of the pagan gods), broken into pieces and lying scattered on the ground before the holy Ark of the Covenant of the God of David. To interpret the woman holding the child as Anahim holding Moses is thncfore absurd. For the Dura Jews, Anahita was but another of those idob shown shattered in another pane!. To represcm her as a !i\'ing deiry and, to boot, as rescuing the infant Moses from me ;S:ik would have becn inconceivable. We thus Tn:ognize, in the mirror of tht· synagoguc murals, a community that was Jcwish in its religious traditions and observances, whose J('wishncss was suflicicntlv \'ital and seU:assured to allow the assunilation of Hellenistic
pictorial an: a~ wcll as of features attributed by Greek religion to its gods, but mat was, at the same time, tradition-bound enough in thl' manner of Talmudic Judaism to reject the very idea that the Greek gods could be anything more than lifeless images tashioncd by human hands.
