Rearming Bhāratam Janam with literary, epigraphical and archaeometallurgical evidence as Vedic River Sarasvati flows on
Roots of Bhāratam Janam from 7th millennium BCE and evidences from Indus Script corpora. Refuting Parpola's Dravidian basis for decipherment
https://friendsofasi.wordpress.com/writings/the-8th-millennium-bc-in-the-lost-river-valley/
Roots of Bhāratam Janam have to be traced from the banks of Rivers Sarasvati and Sindhu identifying their life-activity as metalworkers, metalcasters who made भरत (p. 603) [ bharata
] n A factitious metal compounded of copper, pewter, tin &c. भरत भ (p. 603) [ bharatācē
mbhāṇḍēṃ ] n A vessel made of the metal भरत. 2 See भ रत भ .भरत (p. 603) [ bharatī
] a Composed of the metal भरत. (Marathi. Moleworth).
भ रत Bhāratam janam is the self-designation in Rigveda RV 3.53.12. vi vāmitrasya rak ati br hmed ṃ bhārataṃ j nam. (Trans. This mantra of Visvamitra protects Bharatam people).
Roots of Bhāratam Janam and Hindu civilization have to be understood from Gautama Buddha's Dhammapada Verse 5 Kalayakkhini Vatthu on the gestalt of the people, Indus civilization thought about dharma, derived from the Vedic pramANa:
रर

र एष
Na hi verena verani sammantidha kudacanam averena ca sammanti esa dhammo sanantano.
Verse 5: Hatred is, indeed, never appeased by hatred in this world. It is appeased only by lovingkindness. This is an ancient law त Sanātana dharma, dharma eternal.
Asko Parpola's two critical observations about non-falsifiable, faith-based Indus civilization studies apply equally to Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan. I refute the erroneous interpretations of Parpola using the evidence marshalled by him in his magnum opus. I find that he has NOT found the roots of Hinduism. Blinded by Aryan invasion/migration linguistic doctrine, the civilizational chronology and directios of movements of Bharatam Janam are at variance from the evidence of Baudhayana Srautasutra.
Asko Parpola makes two observations: 1. "...example of a published decipherment, the archaeologist SR Rao tried to assert that the Indus Script is the basis of not only of the Brahmi characters but also of the Semitic alphabet...It requires a lot of trust to believe that Rao's proposed readings make sense in an Aryan language close to Vedi Sanskrit, as he claims." (p.29) 2. '...antiquities from Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa...have been made the subject of much nonsensical writing, which can be nothing but a hindrance in the way of useful research.' (Marshall 1931: I, ix). I believe Marshall would have extended the same advice to all those involved in the Aryan debate, if this had raged in his time as it does today." (Parpola, Asko, 2015, The roots of Hinduism -- the early Aryans and the Indus Civilizatio, OUP, p.31)
Parpola goes on to posit the thought of Indus civilization in religious-Dravidian terms 1, claiming to have identified deities including VaruNa and DurgA worshipped by the civilization and 2. claiming to have located archaeological attestations for Aryan migrations into India. These are tall claims and require a lot of trust to believe in the context of the work of archaeologists claiming trade links as the raison d'etre for the script and works of many scholars including Nicholas Kazanas, Shrikant Talageri, Vishal Agarwal, BB Lal and Shivaji Singh who refute any Aryan invasion/migration/trickle-in into ancient India.
I will echo these observations of Parpola in reference to both Iravatham Mahadevan's and Asko Parpola's Dravidian proofs of Indus Script. It takes a lot of trust to believe that Mahadevan and Parpola have deciphered the Indus Script Corpora.
One example of faith-based proofs is seen from the identification of River Sarasvati. "The repeated references to (great) mountains as Sambara's habitat are a significant pointer to the geographical location of the Dasa forts, ruling out of the Indus valley. A second important ointer appears in RV 6.61,1-3. Here the mighty River Sarasvati is said to have given the powerful Divodasa as a son to Vadhryasva, who worshipped Sarasvati with offerings...The description of Sarasvati in RV 6.61.2 does not at all fit the sacred stream Sarasvati in India (both the Sarsuti



3
and the Ghaggar, with which it is identified, descend from the low Siwalik Mountains): 'By means of her gushing and powerful waves, this (Sarasvati) has crushed the edge of the mountains, (breaking river banks) like a man who digs for lotus roots; with praises and prayers, we solicit Sarasvati for her help. (Sarasvati) who slays the foreigners.' It is widely accepted that the Sarasvati mentioned here is the river that gave the name Harax'vaiti- (in Avestan) or Harahuvati- (in Old Persian) or Arachosia (in Greek) to the province of the Persian empire in southeastern Afghanistan that is chiefly watered by this river. It is generally identified with the Arghandab that descends from a height of nearly four kilometers down to about 700 meters, when it joins the Helmand river, which eventually forms shallow lakes; and the name Sarasvati means: "(river) having ponds or lakes.' The Helmand's present Pashto name comes from Avestan Haetumant- 'having dams'. In the dry season, the Arghandab too may become a series of lakes."(Parpola, 2015, opcit., p.97). It is surprising that Asko Parpola ignores the evidence of tributary Sutlej taking a 90-degree turn at Ropar around a cancyhon in Ropar; prior to this migration caused by plate tectonics, ca. 1900 BCE, Sutlej joined Sarasvati at Shatrana (50 kms. south of Patiala) and the satellite image shows a 20 km wide channel at this confluence. Why shouldn't the description in RV 6.61.2 be seen as a description of this Sarasvati at Ropar (an archaeological site with an ASI museum)? Well, I suppose faith moves mountains from Ropar to Helmand.
One good way to deflate the trust, that is to refute such trust-based pseudo-decipherments is to provide true readings of the Indus Script hieroglyphs cited by Mahadevan and Parpola in their claims based on faith.
Mahadevan's citations have been used to refute his claim at http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/08/iravatham-mahadevan-claims-to-have.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2014/11/dravida-maayaa-of-mahadevan-rejoinder.html
Intimations of religious practices of Bharatam Janam
There are markers from which hypotheses can be formulated as regards the religious practices of the people of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization. The most emphatic artefacts are the architectural features unearthed in Dholavira showing a pair of polished pillars and an 8-shaped stone structure with stone-altars. These finds have to be seen in the context of five s'iva-linga stones found in Harappa and a terracotta s'iva-linga found in Kalibangan. These evidences have to be re-evaluated in the context of the continuing religious and cultural practices in adoration of Agni as the flaming pillar, S'iva and forms of cosmic dancer all over Bharatam or fire
walking celebrations of lingayata-s .
We do not know if the the pair of polished stone pillars were part of such celebrations or the representation of cosmic metaphors of Skambha Sukta (Atharva veda Book 10 Hymn 7).
Profound evidences of religious/cultural continuum continuum is provided by the following:
1. the practice of wearing sindhur by married women. Two terracotta toys found in Nausharo



4
(Mehergarh) showed two women wearing red vermilion (sindhur) at the parting of the black hair, a practice which continues even today in Bharatam.
2. the veneration of s'ankha (turbinella pyrum) as a pancajanya of Sri Krishna to call Bharatam Janam to arms. A burial of a woman in Nausharo showed her wearing s'ankha bangles and jewellery; the burial was dated to ca. 6500 BCE. Turbinella Pyrum shells used as trumpets were are discovered as archaeological artifacts.
It will be an error to reconstruct the ancient cultural mores of Bharatam Janam based on prejudged categories such as Aryan or Dravidian or Munda (Austro-Asiatic) given the overwhelming evidence of an Indian sprachbund, a language union which united the three main language streams and the overwhelming legacy of Prakrit words, many with Samskritam/Chandas (Vedic) cognates, in all present-day languages of Bharatam. For example, 90% of the glosses in Tamil Lexicon (Madras University) contain Samskritam tatsama (cognate) or tadbhava (etyma). Over 11% Sanskrit glosses trace their links to Munda. (pace FBJ Kuipter). There is now sufficient evidence to prove the reality of the Indian sprachbundin an Indian Lexicon with over 8000 semantic clusters including Aryan-Dravidian-Munda glosses, thus questioning the rationale for separating the trio into separate etymological dictionaries.
Vedic River Sarasvati is also mentioned in the two Great Epics: Ramayana and Mahabharata. Mahabharata provides details of pariyatra of Sri Balarama along the River Sarasvati from Dwaraka to the origin in Plaksha Prasravana in Himalayan glaciers. The channels of this river also account for 80% of archaeological sites of Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization on the banks of the two rivers: Sindhu and Sarasvati.
Hopefully, excavations of all the 2,500+ sites of the civilization will help unravel the cultural/religious practices of Bharatam Janam (Mleccha, Hindu) as the practices evolved over time from ca 5th millennium BCE of the Bronze Age. Further researches will unravel the links with the Kirata (Mleccha) janapada and Asura on Ganga basin and the evolution of technologies related to metalwork exemplified by the iron smelters found in Malhar, Raja-nal-ki-tila, Lohardiwa; the non-rusting iron pillar of Vidisha (Sanchi) now in Delhi; the cire perdue alloy metalcastings by dhokra kamar of Bastar or vis'vakarma artisans of Swamimalai in Tamil Nadu evoking the tradition which dates back to ca. 2500 BCE when the dancing girl bronze statue was cast or earlier to ca. 5th millennium BEC when the Nahal Mishmar cire perdue bronze castings were carried aloft in processions by artisans of the Bronze Age across Eurasia along the Tin Road from Meluhha to Mishmar.
It will also be an error to separate Sarasvati-Sindhu civilization and Vedic cuture, premised on erroneous pre-judged chronological sequencing. Sarasvati-Sindhu and Vedic cultures are two sides of the same cultural coin: one dominated by mleccha/meluhha people transacting in the lingua franca, working as Fire workers, excelling in metalcasting work and the other by Philosophers of Fire or Knowledge Explorers, engaged in tapasya and yoga on the links between Being and Becoming. The narrative, the Itihaasa of Bharatam Janam will provide a united narrative of the two converging streams of civilizational and technological advances, both related to enquiries into knowledge systems which found eternal expression in the twin founding ethical principles of Dharma-Dhamma.



5
In terms of chronology, it will be reasonable to date the textual evidence provided by chandas of Rigveda about two millennia prior to the earliest archaeological finds (ca. 3500 BCE) of Sarasvati-Sindhu (Hindu) civilization and archaeological finds in contact areas of SumerMesopotamia from early Bronze Age.
A hypothesis is that the ethical duo of Dharma-Dhamma is the narrative of the Itihaasa of Bharatam Janam over five millennia. The narrative has yet to be told as more researches and more archaeological explorations will continue to provide evidence to test this hypothesis..
This note takes up Parpola's claim based on faith using his evidences from Indus Script Corpora.

First, there is no evidence that Parpola has read BB Lal's Rigvedic People (http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/02/intemperate-unethical-comments-of_22.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/02/the-rigvedic-people-invadersimmigrants.html http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/02/unmasking-motives-of-aryan.html Parpola's attempts at archaeological attestations of Aryan migration into India from BMAC have been refuted by BB Lal and Parpola does not answer these refutations in the Inaugural Address delivered at the 19th International Conference on South Asian Archaeology at University of Bologna, Ravenna, Italy on July 2–6, 2007 'Let not the 19th century paradigms continue to haunt us!' http://archaeologyonline.net/artifacts/19th-century-paradigms.html



8
In my view, Parpola has failed to take into account the evidences provided by BB Lal in this Bologna address to archaeologists.
In particular, BB Lal provides evidences of migrations of Proto-Indo-Aryans out of India in this map citing Baudhayana Srautasutra evidence. Parpola has ignored this evidence from a primary source. Thus, all the arguments he provides about BMAC and other Eurasian cultures with exquisite pictures of horses and wheeled vehicles are empty and based on a faith in what Emeneau referred to as 'the linguistic doctrine' of Aryan invasion/migration to explain the peopling and languages of India. The directions of movements of Proto-Indo-Aryans could have been OUT OF India and NEED NOT be construed as movements INTO India.
Parpola in his Fig.8.6 cites these antennae-hilted swords (a) from Bactria, northern Afghanistan, length 52 cm, and (b) from Fatehgarh, Uttar Pradesh, India, length 63.5 cm.
BB Lal observed: [quote]I am sure Parpola is aware of the fact that the Copper Hoards of the Gangetic Valley, as would be seen from the illustration that follows , include many other very distinctive types, such as anthropomorphic figures, harpoons, shouldered axes, etc. which have never been found in Bactria.



9
Copper hoards from the Gangetic valley, India. Further, the overall cultural ethos, including the distinctive pottery, of the Gangetic Copper Hoards is totally different from that of the BactriaMargiana Archaeological Complex and that the former cannot be derived from the latter. But more strange is the argument that the occurrence of a single antennae-hilted sword in Bactria would entitle that region to be the ‘motherland’ of the Gangetic Copper Hoard people who produced these copper weapons and other associated objects in hundreds, if not thousands. If this logic is stretched further, I will not be surprised if one day Parpola comes out with the thesis that the Harappan Civilization too originated in Margiana, because in that region (at Gonur) has been found one steatite seal bearing typical Harappan inscription and motif, unmindful of the fact that such seals constitute an integral part of the Harappan Civilization.
Harappan seal from Gonur, and its impression.If, following the footsteps of Parpola, I were to say that the find of the well known seal of the ‘Persian Gulf’ style at Lothal in Gujarat establishes that the Persian Gulf Culture (which abounds in such seals) originated in Gujarat or, again, if I said that the occurrence of a



10
cylinder seal at Kalibangan in Rajasthan entitles Rajasthan to be the ‘motherland’ of the Mesopotamian Culture (wherein cylinder seals are found in large numbers), I am sure my learned colleagues present here would at once get me admitted to the nearest lunatic asylum.[unquote]
Surely, it is an article of faith to indicate the direction of migrations into India as Parpola does.
Parpola notes technical terms in Proto-Indo-Aryan in four cuneiform tablets written in the Hittite language of the 15th cent. BCE Bogasko (ancient Hattusa in Turkey). It is amazing that the faith extends to finding the roots of Proto-Indo-Aryan outside India.
va-sa-an-na and Indo-Aryan genitive case va-sa-an-na-sa-ya, 'racecourse, stadium' = Proto IndAryan *vazhana, gen. *vazhanasya > Sanskrit vahana-, gen. vahanasya, 'the act of driving'
va-ar-ta-an-zi 'to turn' = Indo-Aryan vart-, 'to turn' pa-an-za-va-ar-ta-an-na = Indo-Aran panca-, 'five'
Other cuneiform texts of Mitanni-ruled Nuzi in Syria contain color terms:
paprunnu/babrunnu = Vedic Sanskrit babhru- 'brown' pinkarannu = Vedic Sanskrit pingala-, 'reddish brown' parittannu = Vedic Sanskrit palita-, 'gray'
Alalah tablet: aradiyanni (Hurrian) = Indo-Aryan rathya-, 'chariot'
Why can't it be assumed that these Proto-Indo-Aryan words found in ancient Turkey could as well have been due to the migrations of artisans from Indus civilization into Bogaskoy? Surely, the direction of movement of people becomes an article of faith.

Tracing linguistically this Mitanni presence of Rigvedic Indo-Aryan and claiming it to be "an older stage of development than Rigvedic Indo-Aryan" is an article of faith. (Parpola, ibid., p. 91). Who can attest to the direction of borrowing -- from India to Mitanni or from Mitanni to India?

Why should it be assumed that the Gandhara grave culture is an import from Europe? Why can't it be simply an extension of the Vedic tradition of gharma vessel which is Makha's head as MahAvIra? Why should Angirases be met by Rigvedic Indo-Aryans only in southern Central Asia? Could they be part of the movements of people mentioned in Baudhayana Srautasutra cited by BB Lal? How to match archaeology with textual evidence? By an article of Dravida faith, as Parpola demonstrates.
If mukham 'mouth, face' is a Proto-Dravidian word muka 'mouth, face, beginning' as claimed by Parpola (p.169), so be it, it is part of the glosses of Prakritam or Proto-Indo-Aryan of Indus civilization. In any case, direction of borrowings of words CANNOT be proved as Emeneau had underscored.
Why can't the VrAtya mentioned in Atharva veda be meluhha, mleccha whose speech was ProtoIndo-Aryan? This is a logical poser to Parpola that Aryan migrants did NOT encounter a tabula rasa in India but that India already had proto-Indo-Aryan speakers who mispronounced Samskritam words and hence were called mleccha, meluhha. The Meluhha glosses which explain the entire Indus Script Corpora as catalogus catalogorum of metalwork can be categorised as Proto-Indo-Aryan or simply, Prakritam from which tadbhava, tatsama the glosses of Samskritam.could be explained both by aska in his Niruktam and by Panini in his monumental grammar of Samskritam, Ashtadhyayi.

Daimabad seal with the most frequently used 'sign' on Indus Script Corpora. It is a hierolyph signifying SPECIFICALLY 'rim of jar'; that is, not merely, the jar but the rim of the jar.
This is a late Harappan seal excavated at Daimabad. The gloss signified by the hieroglyph on the seal NEED NOT be loanword of Dravidian origin. It could simply be Proto-Indo-Aryan or Prakritam word: karNaka 'rim of jar' as explained below in the context of a Gulf-type seal from Mesopotamia? which explains the hieroglyph of 'rim of jar' duplicated:

Enki can be seen on the Greenstone seal of Adda. The seal of Adda is an Akkadian seal dating back to 2300-2200 BCE (Reade). The cuneiform inscription identifies the owner of the seal as the scribe Adda. The figures on the seal can be identified as Enki, Usimu, Shamash and Inanna. The figure armed with a bow and quiver has not been identified with certainty, but may represent a hunting god like usku (Collon). The seal represents the gods’ roles in everyday Mesopotamian life. Enki is represented with streams of water and fish flowing from his shoulders. He is depicted this way because he is the god of water, fertility and wisdom. Behind Enki is Usimu, Enki’s two-faced minister. In the middle of the seal is the sun god, Shamash. Shamash is shown with rays of light rising from his shoulders. He also has a sword that he is using to cut his way through the mountains so he may rise at dawn (Reade). The winged goddess to the left is Inanna. She is shown with weapons rising from her shoulders and a handful of dates. Inanna is represented this way because she is the goddess of war, fertility, wisdom and love. There are many different gods that represent a variety of things in ancient Mesopotamian culture. The people of these ancient societies used the gods to explain how and why all different aspects of life exist. The seal of Adda shows Enki, Shamash and Inanna doing their duties as gods and goddesses. Enki is shown giving life to the earth with water from the apsu. Through this seal, the people of this culture could better understand the gods and the roles they played on earth. – Jesse Busby Works Cited Horry, Ruth, ‘Enki/Ea (god)’, Ancient Mesopotamian Gods and Goddesses, Oracc and the UK Higher Education Academy, 2013 http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/enki/.

Copper ox-hide ingot. Orthographically, the ingot is a mould with large, curving horns. This was also shown carried by Egyptians on a painting. A Cretan ox-hide ingot also had an incised glyph: Sarasvati hieroglyph of kolom 'graft' rebus: kolami 'smithy, forge'. Inscribed Cretan copper ox-hide ingot (After Fig.82 in: Sinclair Hood, 1971, The Minoans: Crete in the Bronze Age, Thames and Hudson) In the Late Bronze Age, oxhide and plano-convex shaped ingots were used in the Aegean; elsewhere, only small plano-convex (bun-shaped) ingots were used."Bronze tools and weapons were cast in double moulds. The cire perdue process was evidently employed for the sockets of the fine decorated spear-heads of the Late Minoan period. Copper was available in some parts of Crete, notably in the Asterousi mountains which border the Mesara plain on the south, but it may have been imported from Cyprus as well. The standard type of ingot found throughout the East Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age was about two or three feet long, with inward-curving sides and projections for a man to grasp as he carried it on his shoulder. Smaller bun-shaped ingots were also in use." (Sinclair Hood, opcit., p. 106). A variant of the inscribed sign, a comparable logograph, like a trident or a sheaf of corn, is used in Sarasvati hieroglyphs.

Kashmiri glosses:
khār 1 m. (sg. abl. khāra 1 ; the pl. dat. of this word is khāran 1 , which is to be distinguished from khāran , q.v., s.v.), a blacksmith, an iron worker (cf. bandūka-khār, p. 111b, l. 46; K.Pr. 46; H. xi, 17); a farrier (El.). This word is often a part of a name, and in such case comes at the end (W. 118) as in Wahab khār, Wahab the smith (H. ii, 1 ; vi, 17). khāra-basta khāra-basta - f. the skin bellows of a blacksmith. -b ṭh - &above; &below; f. the wall of a blacksmith's furnace or hearth. -bāy - f. a blacksmith's wife (Gr.Gr. 3 ). -d kuru m. a blacksmith's hammer, a sledge-hammer. g ji or -g j - f. a blacksmith's furnace or hearth. -hāl f. (sg. dat. -h j - &above; &below;), a blacksmith's smelting furnace; cf. hāl 5. -kūr f. a blacksmith's daughter. -koṭu m. the son of a blacksmith, esp. a skilful son, who can work at the same profession. -k ṭ f. a blacksmith's daughter, esp. one who has the virtues and qualities properly belonging to her father's profession or caste. -m 1 f. (for 2, see [khāra 3] ), 'blacksmith's earth,' i.e. iron-ore. n cyuwu m. a blacksmith's son. -nay - f. (for khāranay , see [khārun] ), the trough into which the blacksmith allows melted iron to flow after smelting. - añ f.pl. charcoal used by blacksmiths in their furnaces. -wān m. a blacksmith's shop, a forge, smithy



36
(K.Pr. 3). -waṭh - m. (sg. dat. -waṭas - ), the large stone used by a blacksmith as an anvil.
Thus, k arvaṭ may refer to an anvil. Meluhha kār may refer to a crocodile; this rebus reading of the hieroglyph is.consistent with ayakāra ‘ironsmith’ (Pali) [fish = aya (G.); crocodile = kār (Telugu)]
The drummer hieroglyph is associated with svastika glyph on this tablet (har609) and also on h182A tablet of Harappa with an identical text.
dhollu ‘drummer’ (Western Pahari) Rebus dul ‘cast metal’. The 'drummer' hieroglyph thus announces a cast metal. The technical specifications of the cast metal are further described by other hieroglyphs on side B and on the text of inscription (the text is repeated on both sides of Harappa tablet 182).
kola 'tiger' Rebus kol 'alloy of five metals, pancaloha' (Tamil). ḍhol ‘drum’ (Gujarati.Marathi)(CDIAL 5608) Rebus large stone; dul ‘to cast in a mould’. Kanac ‘corner’ Rebus kancu ‘bronze’. dula 'pair' Rebus dul 'cast metal'. kanka ‘Rim of jar’ (Santali); karṇaka rim of jar’(Skt.) Rebus karṇaka ‘scribe’ (Telugu); gaṇaka id. (Skt.)

Figure of a person is ligatured within the body of the peacock with a wavy plume (first peacock on the right); The person shown within the circle is probably the depiction of the departed a_tman, who has, after cremation, become an ancestor. The stylized depiction of the arms is paralleled by the stylized depiction of arms (or horns?) of the copper anthropomorphs found in Copper Hoard Culture.
The Munda word for peacock *mara'k/mara "cryer > peacock", later Sanskrit ma_ra (and Pali etc) 'death, God Death', the Munda peacock symbol = death, and the Cemetery H peacock pictures on urns with cremated bodies.
Peacock and heaven (marak = peacock; merxa_ = sky, heaven ?may the soul go to heaven); Parji. marp- (mart-)= to lighten; Kurux. merxa_ = sky, heaven; Malto. mergu = sky, heaven; see Te. mer_umu = flash of lightning.

Fig. 8.304. Freestanding columns in situ, Dholavira
"8.9.2.2 Free standing columns. At least six examples of freestanding columns were discovered from the excavations. Three freestanding columns are tall and slender pillars with circular crosssection and with a top resembling a phallus or they are phallic in nature. That is why most of them were found in an intentionally damaged and smashed condition. The phallus is depicted realistically with even the drawing of foreskin shown clearly. Two of these freestanding columns are found near eastern end of high street of Castle. These columns measure nearly 1.5m in height and are found at the strategic location of entering into the high street from the east gate of Castle. These two columns are placed in such a manner at the beginning of high street that they divide the street into three equal parts. The other freestanding columns of the same variety and typology, numbering four were found in a completely smashed and broken condition. Two of such columns were found in a secondary condition, fitted as a masonry of Tank A while the other one was found in a masonry in a later period structure near the western fortification of Castle. Two more examles, completely smashed and destroyed ones were also found, one near the western end of Ceremonial Ground and the second near the north gate of Castle. The destruction and desecration of these columns can be equated with that of the damage caused to the stone statue, which clearly indicates a change in ideology and traditions, customs after the Harappan phase."(pp. 589-591) http://asi.nic.in/pdf_data/dholavira_excavation_report_new.pdf

Trefoil decorations associated with the 'priest' statue, 'bull/calf statue' and 'lingam' base are indicative of the possibility that the Bharatam Janam of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro and in Meluhha settlements of Uruk held the aniconic form of lingam in veneration, pointing to an aadhyaatmika gestalt in those early Bronze-age times. Rebus readings have been dealt with elsewhere using Meluhha glosses relatable to the hieroglyphs of bull, bull-calf and priest. (e.g. trilogy of S.

In 1961, an extraordinary treasure was found in a cave near the Dead Sea known as Nahal Mishmar. Two hieroglyphs are vivid: markhor on a flagpost or standard, aquatic bird on a 'crown'. Hidden in a natural crevice and wrapped in a straw mat, the hoard contained 442 different objects: 429 of copper, six of hematite, one of stone, five of hippopotamus ivory, and one of elephant ivory. Many of the copper objects in the hoard were made using the lost-wax process, the earliest known use of this complex technique. For tools, nearly pure copper of the kind found at the mines at Timna in the Sinai Peninsula was used. However, the more elaborate objects were made with a copper containing a high percentage of arsenic (4–12%), which is harder than pure copper and more easily cast.Radiocarbon dating showed that they were from the Chalcolithic or Copper Age, between 4000 and 3500 BCE.

c. 2900 BCE. Khafajah. The best known of the chlorite bowls is from Khafajah; it is of Mesopotamian manufacture. • A man kneels upon the hindquarters of one of a pair of standing zebu bulls facing away from each other. In each hand he holds a stream of water which flows over the head and finishes in front of each bull. Plants grow from the right stream, plants grow behind the left bull, and a plant grows in front of each bull. Above the man are a rosette, a crescent and (possibly) a snake. Above the left stream is some sort of carnivore, perhaps a panther. • An identical man stands behind or between two couchant panthers, rears together and tails raised but heads turned to face each other. In each hand he holds a snake; by his head is another rosette. • An eagle and a lion attack a bull which is lying on its back. Plants grow from behind the lion. To the left of this group is a scorpion. Below the lion’s hindquarters is a scene of two bears standing about a date palm licking their paws.
"In the first half of the 3rd millennium B.C.E., the Iranian plateau (Figure 1) was at the crossroads of trade with its neighboring regions...In the first half of the 3rd millennium, Fars appears as the development center of the first writing, called “proto-Elamite,” which was soon used throughout Iranian plateau. In its southern part of Kerman, tablets have been identified 75 km away to the west of Jiroft at the small site of Tepe Yahya (Yaḥyā), located at about 130 km north of the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf...The region of Jiroft, lying far away from the large centers of civilization, had not until now attracted the attention of researchers. It is located at a distance of 1000 km from the valley of the Euphrates in the west and from the Indus River in the east. Tepe Yahya and Shahdad (Šahdād), 00 km to the north-northeast of Kerman, were occupied at the end of the 3rd millennium and hint at a culture specific to the south of Iran."

Early Harappan zebu figurine with incised spots from Harappa. Some of the Early Harappan zebu figurines were decorated. One example has incised oval spots. It is also stained a deep red, an extreme example of the types of stains often found on figurines that are usually found in trash and waste deposits. Approximate dimensions (W x H(L) x D): 1.8 x 4.6 x 3.5 cm. (Photograph by Richard H. Meadow)
The majestic zebu bull, with its heavy dewlap and wide curving horns is perhaps the most impressive motif found on the Indus seals. Generally carved on large seals with relatively short inscriptions, the zebu motif is found almost exclusively at the largest cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
The rarity of zebu seals is curious because the humped bull is a recurring theme in many of the ritual and decorative arts of the Indus region, appearing on painted pottery and as figurines long before the rise of cities and continuing on into later historical times. The zebu bull may symbolize the leader of the herd, whose strength and virility protects the herd and ensures the procreation of the species or it stands for a sacrificial animal. When carved in stone, the zebu bull probably represents the most powerful clan or top officials of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

These three zebu (bos indicus) seals are instructive. On two seals, the hieroglyphs presented relate to the lexemes: ayas + kaNDa read rebus: metal smelter (furnace). The Harappa seal presents the hieroglyphs: kodo 'millet' (Mu.) + kolmo 'three (numeral strokes)'(Mu.) read rebus: konda 'casting furnace, kiln' + kolami 'forge, smithy' (Te.) It is unclear if two types of furnaces were identified by the hieroglyphs used: one type of furnace used for casting (metal) and another used for smelting (in smithy). It is also unclear if the 'three numeral strokes' glyph should be read as a phonetic determinative of the paired glyph, if the plant glyph on Harappa seal is read as: kolmo 'rice plant'. Seedecoding inscription on Indus seal of Mitathal seal. One way to resolve the issue is to identify an allograph in the script corpus and read the glyphs in the context of glyph sequences used.

Sign 169 and variants.
One 'plant' glyph shows three prongs (as on the Harappa zebu seal); another shows five. (i.e. Sign 162 - with three prongs and Sign 169 - with five prongs) kūli-dolu rice plant; (Isr.) dulomi plant. (DEDR 3517) Rebus dul ‘cast (metal)(Santali) Vikalpa (alternative): Three prongs glyph (Sign 162) of the plant may denote kodo 'millet'. Five prongs glyph (Sign 169) of the plant may denote tagara 'a kind of flowering tree' (Telugu). If this vikalpa holds, the scribe and artisan may have used the two signs distinctly to denote types of casting or smelting furnaces: one for tin (tagaraka) and the other for other metals.

Is the syllable or phoneme KI related to kalmeia? : "The nomenclature of zinc and its alloys is a difficult chapter of ancient metallurgy, for the ancients did not readily distinguish the alloys of lead, silver, tinb, zin and antimony, they could not analyse the components and the name very arbitrarily. This is the reason why they often vary their meaning in the course of the ages. Thus for instance the Sanskrit nAga is really lead, but it is used for tin or zinc too! Strabo tells us in an interesting passage (XIII, 1, 5, c. 610): 'There is a stone in the neighbourhood of Andeira which when burned becomes iron, and then, when heated in a furnace with a certain earth distils pseudoargyron and this with the addition of copper makes the mixture (krama) as it is called which some is called oreichalkos.'...Though zinc-iron ores exist this procedure is impossible. It would seem that Diergart is right here and that this pseudoargyron is a silver-like alloy of unknown composition. Though arsenical copper and iron ores abound in the Troad, it is doubtful whether an arsenic-copper or arsenic-iron alloy could be prepared he way Strabo suggests!...kadmeia, kadmia as the general names for zinc ores. The latter term was corrupted by the Arabian alchemists to kalmeia, kalamiya, kalimina and early in the fifteenth century we find the terms kalmis or galmei...The general Persian ter for zinc ores and zinc oxyde is tutiya, which



83
occurs frequently in medieval literature as tutia or totia! Laufer has suggested that the Chinese l'ou shi (a metallic product from Sassanian Persia) was brass...The Sanskrit tuttha is derived from tutiya...

"Indus inscriptions resemble the Egyptian hieroglyphs...": John Marshall "A good many important facts can be determined, however, to clear the ground for more satisfactory research. In the first place this script is in no way even remotely connected with either the Sumerian or Proto-Elamitic signs. I have compare some of the signs with the signs of these scripts. For the references to the Sumerian pictographs, or the earliest forms of the Sumerian signs, I have referred the reader to the numbers of REC. (Thureau-Dangin, "Recherches sur l'Origine de l'Ecriture Cuneiforme") and for the Proto-Elamitic signs to Professor Scheil's "Textes de Comptabilite Proto-Elamites", in vol. xvii of Memoires de la Mission Archeologique de Perse, pp. 31-66. This series is commonly cited as Del. Per. (Delegation en Perse). The Indus inscriptions resemble the Egyptian hieroglyphs far more than they do the Sumerian linear and cuneiform system." [John Marshall, 1996 (Repr.), Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilization: Being an official account of Archaeological Excavations at Mohenjo-Daro carried out by the Government of India between the years 1922 and 1927,Asian Educational Services, pp. 423424] http://books.google.com/books?id=SZWE7O5vusC&dq=elam+indus&source=gbs_navlinks_s

Mohenjodro 0304 Seal impression. Identical impression on m0494/0495 two prism-shaped tablets. This is an update on Nov. 13, 2011 of a note posted on Nov. 12, 2011. An annex is added, decoding another long inscription. (The blog post was originally titled: 'Decoding the longest inscription of Indus Script'). Now it has been retitled to cover another long inscription. This note decodes the longest inscription --on one side of a tablet -- of Indus Script. There are two prism tablets (m0494 and m0495) with an identical inscription of three lines on three sides (of the two tablets). The three lines of m0494/m0495 read together, may constitute an inscription longer than the one on m-0304 seal impression. The inscription on m-0494/m-0495 which contains 23 glyphs (adding all the glyphs on three sides of a prism) is decoded in the annex -- treating the three lines of inscriptions on the prisms as one composite inscription with a composite message. There can only be a congecture as to why the prism tablets were mass produced with identical three lines of impression: it is likely that the tablets were used by artisans of a guild performing identical metal work for transporting packages with identical contents and hence, identical messages conveyed through the inscription. Executive summary The indus script inscription is a detailed account of the metal work engaged in by the Indus artisans. It is a professional calling card of the metalsmiths' guild of Mohenjodaro used to affix a sealing on packages of metal artefacts traded by Meluhha (mleccha)speakers.
Text. Reading of glyphs on m0314 Seal impression. A notable featue of the sequencing of glyphs is the use of three variants of 'fish' glyphs on line 1 of the inscription. Each variant 'fish' glyph has been distinctively decoded as working with ore, metalwork (forging, turning) and casting. Rebus decoding of glyphs on the seal impression: Three lines of the inscription with glyphs can be read rebus from right to left -- listing the metallurgical competence of the artisans' guild:Line 1: Turner workshop; forge, stone ore, ingot; excellent cast metal Line 2: Metal workshop, ingot furnace, casting, riveting smithy,forge; Furnace scribe Line 3: Smithy, lump of silver (forging metal); Mint, gold furnace; Smithy/forge; Turner small workshop Details: Line 1 1.1.

Inscription on tablet m0495 serves as a reinforcement of the reading of inscription on tablet m0494 (see the side shot of sides B and G reproduced above). The organizer of the photographic corpus, Asko Parpola, should be complimented for a painstaking effort to produce a high resolution reading of 3 lines of the text on the prism tablets (which almost look like five- sided object as may be seen from the photograph M-494F). Sharper resolution images of the two tablets (3.6 cm. long) with three sides of a prism are as follows: m0495A m-0495B m-0495G The reading of the text of the inscription on the two prism tablets provided in Mahadevan concordance is as follows:

Text 1623/Text 2847 Decoding the identical inscription on Prism tablets m0494 and m0495 Line 1 Turner, mint, brass-work, furnace scribe, smelter, gridiron smithy, smithy/forge Line 2 Mineral (ore), furnace/altar, furnace scribe workshop; metal (a kind of iron), casting furnace; cast metal ingot; casting workshop Line 3 Furnace scribe workshop; cast bronze; kiln; gridiron; casting workshop; smithy (with) furnace; cast bronze; native metal; metal turner; furnace scribe. Thus, line 1 is a description of the repertoire of a smithy/forge including mint and brass-work; line 2 is a smelting, casting workshop for ingots; line 3 is furnace scribe workshop for caste bronze, with kiln, furnace and native metal turning.

Vikalpa ḍato ‘claws or pincers (chelae) of crabs’; ḍaṭom, ḍiṭom to seize with the claws or pincers, as crabs, scorpions; ḍaṭkop to pinch, nip (only of crabs) (Santali) Rebus dhātu ‘mineral’ (Vedic); dhatu ‘a mineral, metal’ (Santali) Vikalpa erā ‘claws’; Rebus era ‘copper’.
Argument: Allographs of a leaf sign, ligature with crab sign [After Parpola, 1994, fig. 13.15] The archer shown on one copper tablet seems to be equivalent to a glyph on another copper plate -that of ligatured U (rimless wide-mouthed pot) with leaves and crab’s claws. The archer has been decoded kamāṭhiyo archer; kāmaṭhum a bow; kāmaḍ, kāmaḍum a chip of bamboo (G.) kāmaṭhiyo a bowman; an archer (Skt.lex.)

(Ta.) The sequence of two glyphs discussed in 1.3 and 1.4 above occur with high frequency on copper tablets. The pair of glyphs is read rebus as: metal work, furnace scribe -- kasērā kaṇḍa kanka. The following examples are of 8 copper tablets recovered in Harappa by HARP project. A third glyph on these tablets is an oval sign -- like a metal ingot -- and is ligatured with an infixed sloping stroke ḍhāḷiyum adj. sloping, inclining (G.) The ligatured glyph is read rebus as ḍhālako a large metal ingot (G.) ḍhālakī a metal heated and poured into a mould; a solid piece of metal; an ingot (G.) The inscription on these tablets is in bas-relief:

The three glyphs on the ingots are read in sequence: ḍ ālako kasērā kaṇḍa kanka 'metal ingot, metal work, furnace scribe'. This is a professional calling card of the artisan engaged in metal work.

Model of a place of worship, known as the Sit Shamshi, or "Sunrise (ceremony)" Middle-Elamite period, toward the 12th century BC Acropolis mound, Susa, Iran; Bronze; H. 60 cm; W. 40 cm Excavations led by Jacques de Morgan, 1904-5; Sb 2743; Near Eastern Antiquities, Musée du Louvre/C. Larrieu. Two nude figures squat on the bronze slab, one knee bent to the ground. One of the figures holds out open hands to his companion who prepares to pour the contents of a lipped vase onto them.The scene takes place in a stylized urban landscape, with reduced-scale architectural features: a tiered tower or ziggurat flanked with pillars, a temple on a high terrace. There is also a large jar resembling the ceramic pithoi decorated with rope motifs that were used to store water and liquid foodstuffs. An arched stele stands by some rectangular basins. Rows of 8 dots in relief flank the ziggurat; jagged sticks represent trees.An inscription tells us the name of the piece's royal dedicator and its meaning in part: "I Shilhak



103
Inshushinak, son of Shutruk-Nahhunte, beloved servant of Inshushinak, king of Anshan and Susa [...], I made a bronze sunrise."
Three jagged sticks on the Sit Shamshi bronze, in front of the water tank (Great Bath replica?) If the sticks are orthographic representations of 'forked sticks' and if the underlying language is Meluhha (mleccha), the borrowed or substratum lexemes which may provide a rebus reading are: kolmo 'three'; rebus; kolami 'smithy' (Telugu) [ mēṇḍhā ] A crook or curved end (of a stick,
horn &c.) and attrib. such a stick, horn, bullock. [ mēḍhā ] m A stake, esp. as forked. meḍ(h), meḍhī f., meḍhā m. ʻ post, forked stake ʼ.(Marathi)(CDIAL 10317) Rebus mẽ hẽt, meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.) Thus, three jagged sticks on the Sit Shamshi bronze may be decoded as meḍ kolami 'iron (metal) smithy'. 'Iron' in such lexical entries may refer to 'metal'. Sit Shamshi bronze illustrates the complex technique of casting separate elements joined together with rivets, the excavations at Susa have produced one of the largest bronze statues of Antiquity: dating from the 14th century BC, the effigy of "Napirasu, wife of Untash-Napirisha," the head of which is missing, is 1.29 m high and weighs 1,750 kg. It was made using the solid-core casting method. These metallurgical techniques find an expression on Indus script inscriptions as seen on this

[quote]Textual analysis of cuneiform tablets coupled with recent excavations along the Persian Gulf also show that Indus merchants routinely plied the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf, likely in reed boats with cotton sails. “They were major participants in commercial trade,” says Bisht, who sees Dholavira and other sites along the coast as trading centers thanks to monsoon winds that allowed sailors to cross 800 kilometers of open waters speedily. “These people were aggressive traders, there is no doubt about it,” adds Possehl, who has found Indus-style pottery made from Gujarat clay at a dig in Oman. Archaeologist Nilofer Shaikh, vice chancellor of Latif University, takes that assertion a step further, arguing that “the Indus people were controlling the trade. They controlled the quarries, the trade routes, and they knew where the markets were.”
She points out that although Indus artifacts spread far and wide, only a small number of Mesopotamian artifacts have been found at Indus sites. Evidence suggests that some Indus merchants and diplomats lived abroad, although the trade was certainly two-way. An inscription from the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. refers to one Shu-ilishu, an interpreter from Meluhha, reports NYU's Wright in a forthcoming book. What may be Shu-ilishu and his wife are featured on a seal wearing Mesopotamian dress. There is some evidence for a village of Indus merchants between 11 and 00 B.C.E. in southern Iraq. And “a man from Meluhha” knocked out someone's tooth during an altercation and was made to pay a fine, according to a cuneiform text, hinting at a life that was neither faceless nor boring.

Ganeriwala is situated near the Indian border on the dry river bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra (also called the Sarasvati River), now a part of vast desert. It is spread over 80 hectares and comparable in size with the largest sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as Mohenjo-daro. A terrecotta tablet is a significant find. In this seal, a cross legged person (suggested as yogic posture) and a kneeling person below a tree and upon a tree are depicted. Such kneeling persons on tree, particularly in front of a tiger like animal, are shown in tablets or seals found at Harappa (H 163 a), Mohenjadaro(M 309 a) and Kalibangan (K 49a). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganeriwala
