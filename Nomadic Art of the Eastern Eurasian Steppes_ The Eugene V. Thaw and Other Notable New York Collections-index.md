DIRECTOR'S FOREWORD
This exhibition, Nomadic Art of the Eastern Eurasian Steppes, has
been staged to celebrate the gift by Eugene V. Thaw of his
extensive collection of bronze, silver, and gold objects from
the steppes of Eurasia. The qualifier "eastern" in the title of
the exhibition reflects the preponderance of objects from
Mongolia and North China, although there are not a few
pieces in the collection that originated from as far as west of
the Black Sea. In this exhibition, the Thaw collection is aug
mented by a few objects each from several collectors in the
New York area and from the Museum's own holdings.
Works of art from the steppe zone of the Eurasian continent
are not strange to the Metropolitan Museum. Over the years,
the Museum has mounted a number of exhibitions of the art
of the steppes, including, in 197^, From the Lands ofthe Scythians
and, as recently as 2000, The Golden Deer of Eurasia. All of
these have been loan exhibitions from countries in which the
objects were found, and most of the exhibits have related to
the western part of the Eurasian steppes and to cultures asso
ciated with the Scythians and the Sarmatians, with the inclu
sion of some objects from Siberia and the Altai Mountains.
The present exhibition is the first at the Metropolitan
Museum that comprises mainly objects that are now in the
permanent collection of the Museum and shows predomi
nantly articles from the eastern part of the Eurasian steppes.
The gift of the Thaw collection increases measurably the
Museum's holdings in the art of the early nomads of the
Eurasian steppes dating from the first millennium B.C. to the
early centuries of our era. Hitherto, early nomadic art has
been represented by small groups of objects in the depart
ments of Greek and Roman, ancient Near Eastern, and Asian
art. The Museum will now be able to put on permanent dis
play a large selection of artifacts from the Eurasian steppes,
representing in its galleries a major branch of the arts of the
ancient world. The art of the steppes, characterized by pow
erful animal imagery and dynamic designs, is visually com
pelling to us today, as it must have been in ancient times to
the peoples in sedentary societies who came into contact
with the pastoral nomads. Art historians are increasingly
turning to the study of this tradition as an important source
for the decorative arts in Eurasia in subsequent periods.
The Thaw collection at the Metropolitan Museum will
facilitate this study.
The name of Eugene V. Thaw has long been associated
with Western art, particularly old master drawings, of
which he is a well-known collector and connoisseur. Some
know him also as a major collector of Native American art.
Few know of his long-standing interest in the art of the
ancient nomads. We are grateful that he has seen fit to
donate this collection, which he has formed over the years,
to the Metropolitan Museum. His gift will benefit both the
visitors to the Museum and the scholarly community. I
would like also to extend my thanks to Katherine and
George Fan and to Shelby White and Leon Levy, as well as
to those who have chosen to lend anonymously, for further
enriching this exhibition.
The exhibition and this catalogue would not have been
possible without the wide-ranging participation of Emma C.
Bunker, Research Consultant in the Asian Art Department of
the Denver Art Museum, whose vast knowledge of the art
and culture of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes has
earned her the reputation of preeminent scholar in the field.
The exhibition was organized by the Department of Asian
Art, under the direction of James C.Y. Watt, Brooke Russell
Astor Chairman of the department, who was assisted in this
effort by Zhixin Sun, Associate Curator. I wish to extend my
deepest thanks both to Mrs. Bunker and to the Department of
Asian Art for the excellent results of their study of the Thaw
collection and the planning of the exhibition.
The Metropolitan Museum is indebted to the generous
support of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation toward
this exhibition. It was through funding from The Adelaide
Milton de Groot Fund, in memory of the de Groot and
Hawley families, that this exhibition catalogue was made
possible.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I am both thrilled and honored to have been invited by
Eugene V. Thaw to help form and research his landmark col
lection of steppe art, for which I owe him an enormous debt
of gratitude. It is rare that one finds a collector as knowl
edgeable and discerning as Gene, and our work together has
proved to be not only a magical collaborative effort but a
delightful pleasure. Both Gene and I live in the West, ride
horses, and herd cattle. We can therefore be said to have
firsthand experience in the lifestyle of the pastoral world and
a special insight, crucial to the writing of this book, into the
mentality of people involved with animals.
Gene's vision in forming this collection and in presenting
it to The Metropolitan Museum of Art demonstrates his per
ceptive recognition of an aesthetic that has long been over
looked. The pastoral peoples of the Eurasian steppes made a
significant contribution in antiquity to the artistic and tech
nological development of both Asia and Europe, a contribu
tion that is now highlighted by a rich representation of their
art in this great museum
I am particularly grateful to Philippe de Montebello,
Director of the Metropolitan Museum, and to James C.Y.
Watt, Brooke Russell Astor Chairman of the Department of
Asian Art, for entrusting me with the presentation in this
catalogue of Eugene Thaw's generous gift. The publication,
which is both timely and scholarly, is the result of a collabora
tion between many people of diverse backgrounds. Who else
but James Watt, one of the leading scholars in the field of
Chinese art today, could better present China's urban point
of view toward its northern nomadic neighbors. By contrast,
Eugene Thaw is one of the great dealers in old master paintings
and drawings. Known for his "eye" and connoisseurship, he has
collected instinctively, with an intuition for rarity and beauty.
At the Metropolitan Museum, I would like to thank John
P. O'Neill, Editor in Chief, for his support of this project
and for his faith that Emily Walter, Senior Editor, and I
could successfully organize this complex publication. Without
her resourcefulness and fascination with the subject, this cat
alogue could not have been produced. Whenever I was
stymied or at a loss for words, Emily would provide just the
right solution. My colleague Zhixin Sun, Associate Curator
in the Department of Asian Art and a contributor to this vol
ume, was enormously helpful throughout the cataloguing
process. I am most appreciative of the scientific information
provided by Richard Stone, Conservator. My heartfelt
thanks goes to Judith Smith, Administrator of the Department
of Asian Art, who coordinated all the activities and personal
ities involved, and did it with diplomatic panache. When
things seemed overwhelming, she was always available to
solve problems.
Last, but not least, I wish to thank the Metropolitan
Museum colleagues involved with the production of this cat
alogue for their diligence and encouragement. Bruce Campbell
created the sensitive and refined design. Oi-Cheong Lee and
Joseph Coscia Jr. brilliantly photographed the objects, mak
ing them sparkle and showing them to their best advantage
Peter Antony, Chief Production Manager, and Megan
Arney, Production Manager, ensured that the photographs
were well produced, both in clarity and color. Jean Wagner,
bibliographic editor, with unflappable attention to detail,
made sure that my references were correct. Adam Hart
designed the handsome maps. Elizabeth Powers worked as
research editor, and Shi-yee Liu translated the Chinese titles
in the bibliography.
The variety of objects presented here also required help and
advice from many other colleagues, both in China and in
Russia, as well as in the United States. Foremost are Han Rubin
and Wu En, both of whom traveled with me throughout
China, helping me to gain access to many excavated examples
and to understand how they were produced. Without their
advice this publication could never have been written. I am
grateful to Sergei Miniaev and to my late colleagues Yevgeny
Lubo-Lesnichenko, Eleanora Novgorodova, and Maria
Zavitukhina. I am especially thankful to Jenny F. So and
Katheryn M. Linduff, both of whom read parts of the text,
made constructive suggestions, and generously shared with me
all their resources. Additional scientific examination by Pieter
Meyers, Conservator at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, of many pieces before they were acquired by Eugene
VIII



Thaw was crucial to confirmation of their authenticity and to
my understanding of how they were manufactured. I am also
appreciative of John Stevenson's helpful advice in the initial
writing of my essays
Obscure references and publications were acquired
through inter-library loan by Nancy Simon, librarian at the
Denver Art Museum, and by John Stucky, at the Asian Art
Museum of San Francisco. Helpful advice and information
were also provided by Robert H. Ellsworth, Joseph G.
Gerena, Catherine Simon Geventer, James J. Lally, Bo
Lawergren, Judith Lerner, Karen Rubinson, and the staffs of
Ariadne Gallery, Inc., Eskenazi Ltd., and Ward & Company,
Inc. Invaluable help in reading references in Chinese was
always available from my friend Ranyin Wu, and endless
xeroxes were happily provided by Joyce and Bob Noyces,
often working after hours.
I would like to thank in particular William Watson,
Keeper of the Chinese Collection at the British Museum and
my professor at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York City,
who first introduced me to the art of the steppes and guided
me north through the Great Wall.
To Katherine and George Fan, to Shelby White and Leon
Levy, and to those who who have lent anonymously to this
exhibition, I am pleased for having been given the opportu
nity to study their collections and grateful for their generos
ity, help, and advice.
Finally, I wish to thank my husband, John Bunker, for his
support and his goodwill, enabling me to spend the many
hours necessary to complete this project.
Emma C. Bunker
For the organization and installation of the exhibition, my
colleague Zhixin Sun, Associate Curator in the Department
of Asian Art, has served as coordinator. The imaginative
exhibition design is by Michael Batista, the elegant graphics
is the work of Jill Hammarberg, and the brilliant lighting is
directed by Zack Zanolli. The installation team of Jeffrey
Perhacs, Nancy Reynolds, Frederick Sager, and Alexandra
Walcott mounted, in their magical way, the many small
objects in the exhibition. Linda Sylling oversaw all practical
aspects of the installation, and Taylor Miller supervised the
construction work.
My own participation has been ably ordered and assisted
by Judith Smith, who also worked with Emma C. Bunker
and Zhixin Sun in pulling together all the illustrative mate
rial for the catalogue and acted as liaison for the Department
of Asian Art with Emma Bunker during its preparation.
Yangming Chu and Hwai-ling Yeh- Lewis spent hour upon
hour organizing and reorganizing the list of exhibits and
the many images in the course of the preparation of the
exhibition.
Bruce Campbell, as usual, has designed the catalogue
in a style that is appropriate to the content. The handsome
volume is also enhanced by the expert and sympathetic pho
tography of Oi-Cheong Lee and Joseph Coscia Jr. of the
Museum's Photograph Studio.
The scientific authentication of antiquities in metal, espe
cially those in precious metals, is always difficult after the
objects have been in collections and handled for a number of
years. Special thanks are due to Pieter Meyers, of the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, who reexamined many
pieces in the Eugene V. Thaw collection after they had been
deposited at the Metropolitan Museum.
In the course of learning about the subject of steppe art, I
benefited from discussions with Eugene Thaw, Karen
Rubinson, and, of course, Emma Bunker. Esther Jacobson
read what I wrote for this catalogue and corrected some mis
takes—those that remain are mine alone.
Finally, I acknowledge Emily Walter, the editor of this
catalogue, who improved my writing and whose patience
and good sense turned a chore into a pleasure.

COLLECTOR'S FOREWORD
As an art dealer for nearly half a century, I had the vivid expe
rience of having thousands of works of art pass through my
hands. Each one required that I learn something about it,
judge how much I liked or disliked it, and rank it against oth
ers of its kind. Being in the presence of the object itself, rather
than looking at a slide or photograph—or today, a computer
image—provokes this kind of intense inquiry, especially if
one is risking one's scarce resources to own it. It was this
striving for discipline and the instinct for putting objects into
some sort of order that led me to become a collector.
Throughout my career as a dealer I collected master
drawings, which I continue to do. This collection, destined
for the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, has been
published and widely exhibited. It has certainly been my
principal focus as a collector, and is by some measure my
life's work.
Some fifteen years ago, I began the gradual process of
retirement from art dealing — but not from my involvement
with art. My wife, Clare, and I moved to Santa Fe, New
Mexico, far removed from any temptation on my part to
commute from our home in the suburbs to my Manhattan
office. Santa Fe has lots of art but few old master drawings,
and it soon became clear that I would have to find a new out
let for my passion to collect. With the greatest help from
Ralph T. Coe, former Director of the Nelson-Atkins
Museum of Art in Kansas City, 1 who had also retired to Santa
Fe, I began a collection of North American Indian art, which
is now housed in the new wing of the Fenimore Art
Museum, in Cooperstown, New York.
Just as I add a drawing or two every so often to the sub
stantial collection already in the Morgan Library, so, too, do
I occasionally add a work of American Indian art, if it is out
standing and fills a gap, to the Cooperstown museum. But
filling in gaps was not enough of a challenge to someone who
was possessed by the desire to collect—indeed, far more
intensely than even I had ever suspected.
Quite simply, I had a craving—to hold objects in my
hands, to learn about them, to make judgments about their
quality. Also, I needed a subject that was relatively unex
plored, objects not already collected by worldwide competi
tors, such as Rembrandt etchings or Tang dynasty ceramics.
Something not too fashionable would also be more affordable,
especially for a collection that I tended to think of as therapy
for an obsession I could not control.
Years ago, I knew the late Bruce Chatwin when he
worked at Sotheby's as a very young man and, like him and
others mad about objects, I often dropped in to visit the
London private dealer and guru of ancient objects John
Hewett. Somehow, in that circle I became aware of the so
called Ordos bronzes and purchased a few, just to establish
an acquaintance. I also aquired Alfred Salmony's seminal
book, in which were published the large group he called
Sino-Siberian, which had been assembled before 1 930 by the
great dealer C. T. Loo in Paris. 2 A few years later, in 1970, I
saw and was intrigued by the pioneering exhibition at Asia
Society, New York, "Animal Style Art from East to West,"
organized and catalogued by Emma C. Bunker. Bruce
Chatwin collaborated with Emmy on that exhibition, writ
ing an essay extolling the culture of nomadism, a subject that
would become a leitmotif in his subsequent career as a nov
elist and travel writer (In Patagonia, The Songlines, etc.).
I traded away a few pieces from that early group, and
when the American Indian collection left our house for the
Fenimore Art Museum, I had two Ordos pieces remaining in
my possession—one a very fine bronze deer with folded legs
and the other a belt plaque that I had learned was a forgery.
After I had made a fairly substantial reentry into this field, I
discovered that my longtime associate at E. V. Thaw and
Co., Patricia Tang, knew Emmy Bunker, who had over the
years become the most highly respected authority on the art
of the Asian steppes. I, of course, contrived to meet her, and
the rest of that story is revealed in this catalogue of the col
lection she helped me to assemble.
Again through Patty Tang, I got to meet James C.Y.
Watt, just as he was about to assume the chairmanship of the
Department of Asian Art at the Metropolitan Museum.
Philippe de Montebello had heard via the grapevine—which
great museum directors invariably have access to—that I was
x



now collecting Ordos bronzes. He maneuvered James and
me to seats around his grand table in the director's office,
and suddenly there was talk of an exhibition of nomadic art
that would be held in about two years' time. I then set about
to expand and refine the collection, with the advice and
encouragement that I had come to depend on from Emmy
Bunker. Luck and serendipity of course play a role in such
activities. One day James and Emmy were meeting with me
in my office for an early discussion of the Met's plans,
when a private collector-dealer from Kyoto walked in carry
ing—wrapped in a towel—a rare Ordos bronze helmet. Of
course, it was immediately acquired.
Emmy Bunker, as well as being the brilliant cataloguer of
the collection, has become a good friend to Clare and to me,
and we three are very gratified that the works will remain
always in the Metropolitan. For there it will surely shed light
on the movement of styles across the vast steppes of Eurasia
during the first millennium B.C., as the nomadic peoples
bridged the great spaces between the high civilizations of
China and the Mediterranean.

The World of the Eurasian Nomads









Nomadic Art of the
Eastern Eurasian Steppes

INTRODUCTION
James C . Y . Watt
There is a major source of artistic styles and motifs
that has so far not featured in the general writing
on the visual arts of Europe and Asia. This is the art
of the pastoral nomads who roamed the Eurasian steppes for
most of the first millennium before our era. Over the vast
expanse of grasslands stretching from Siberia to Scythia, there
are no natural boundaries, and the cultural artifacts of the
horse-riding nomads display a remarkable homogeneity
perhaps reflecting similarities in their way of life and in their
natural environments. This was particularly the case in the
early part of the millennium, when pastoral nomadism began
to spread among the peoples who inhabited the steppes of
Eurasia. By the fifth century B.C., the nomads had achieved a
high degree of material prosperity as a result of economic
success in livestock herding and trading — peacefully or by
force of arms — as evidenced by the rich archaeological
remains from this period. Prosperity also brought about the
flourishing of an artistic style that was to leave an indelible
impression on the arts of nomadic societies in Eurasia
through all subsequent periods and that was absorbed into
the decorative vocabulary of works of art in agrarian societies
whose domains bordered their lands.
Present-day knowledge concerning the arts of the
nomadic world is insufficient for a systematic art-historical
exposition. However, it is hoped that the present exhibi
tion, drawn mainly from one collection, will serve to illustrate
some of the salient features of a neglected artistic tradition
and draw attention to the exhibits as works of art rather
than as archaeological objects. Nevertheless, in the cata
logue entries, by Emma C. Bunker, reference to cognate
material found in archaeological context will be included.
PASTORAL NOMADISM
The economy of the pastoral nomads was based on live
stock herding and involved a constant search for pastures.
The extent of their migration differed from group to
group, and there was no universal pattern. For some it may
have involved only transit between summer and winter
habitats, although the distances separating the two locations
varied greatly, while others were constantly on the move.
The composition of the herds — sheep, goats, horses,
camels, and cattle — also varied with natural conditions.
Before the onset of nomadism, steppe peoples depended
on hunting and animal husbandry; some agriculture was
practiced, but only where soil, water, and climate permitted.
The exact causes for the shift to nomadism is still a matter
of scholarly debate. The academic discourse on this subject
can reach a degree of verbal and technical complexity that
defies any attempt at comprehension by the ordinary
reader. 1 The most common conjectures advanced as expla
nations for the origin of nomadism are based on climatic
change, ecological adaptation, and social organization
each of these possibly being a factor in the cause.
Our knowledge of the early nomads derives from two
sources. The first is the writings of ancient authors, notably
those of Greece, Achaemenid Persia, and China. The sec
ond comes from archaeological work, mainly the excava
tion of kurgans — ancient graves covered by earth and
stone mounds, the largest of which can reach nearly sixty
feet in height and two hundred feet in diameter. The names
by which nomadic peoples are known are taken from early
writings. The fifth-century B.C. Greek historian Herodotus
referred to nomads as Scythians, because they inhabited the
northern shores of the Black Sea — known as Scythia — and
came into close contact with the Greeks. Achaemenid
Iranian inscriptions give us the appellation Saka, the name
by which the Iranians called the nomads they encountered.
And early Chinese texts recorded the names of various
nomadic tribes on China's northern borders (some different
names may refer to the same people). But it was not until
the second century B.C. that the historian Sima Oian gave an
3



account of the Xiongnu (formerly romanized as Hsiung-nu),
the people — or a confederation of tribes — who had
amassed along the line demarcated by the Great Wall.
Archaeologists (both the field and the armchair vari
eties) use names such as those mentioned above to refer to
nomads in the description and discussion of archaeological
data and artifacts identified as associated with nomadic peo
ples. However, the names of tribes or confederations that
appear in the historical records of literate sedentary soci
eties relate to specific events and locations in border
areas. The application of these names to peoples active in
different times and places far from the recorded events can,
and does, cause confusion for nonspecialists. Some authors
use the name Scythian in the more restricted sense to refer
to the peoples in the north Pontic (Black Sea) area — as
recorded by Herodotus — while others designate all no
madic peoples as Scythians, sometimes making a distinction
between European Scythians and Asian Scythians. Yet oth
ers use the term Scytho- Siberian as the designation for all
early nomadic peoples. In the East, the records of the
Xiongnu in Chinese historical writings have also caused this
appellation to be applied rather loosely to most sites and
artifacts found in the eastern part of the Eurasian steppes
that display a nomadic flavor, particularly sites and artifacts
judged to date from the third century B.C. and later. Thus,
the period from the third century B.C. to the sixth century
a.d. in the "Asiatic" part of the nomadic world is some
times known as the Hunnic period, on the assumption that
the Huns, or their predecessors the Xiongnu (pronounced
hun-nu in antiquity), were the dominant power in the
Asiatic steppes at this time
THE ART OF THE NOMADS
The material culture of the nomads is known to us from
archaeological remains, mostly recovered from burials and,
in later periods, from settlement sites such as those in
the Transbaikal area associated with the Xiongnu. 2
Unfortunately, most kurgans, especially the more promi
nent ones, were pillaged in antiquity. The few undisturbed
graves hold a wealth of objects, mostly of gold and bronze.
Other objects fashioned from wood, leather, birch bark,
felt, and other perishable materials survive to varying
extent depending on local conditions.
The salient feature of the art of the nomads is the preva
lence of animal motifs. This has given rise to the term "ani
mal style" in the literature. The animals, both wild and
domestic, are represented either realistically or in degrees
of stylization, achieving at times a hieratic aspect.
Irrespective of the degree of stylization, the images are
imbued with a power and vitality that are most striking,
especially in the motif of the animal combat, which began
to appear by about the eighth century B.C. This animal art
can be studied in several ways, from anthropological
approaches, including the search for the symbolic and reli
gious significance of the motifs, to the purely art-historical.
At the most basic and practical level, the species of animals
represented on objects from different areas also provide
clues to the general direction of the migration of peoples
over time, as opposed to movements within seasonal
confines. It has been pointed out, for example, that the
images of the birds, felines, and deer seen on objects from
Scythian burials in Ukraine find close parallels in the fauna
that still inhabit the Altai Mountain region in southern
Siberia. This observation, together with the typological
study of artifacts found in the Altai and in Ukraine, has
given rise to the hypothesis that the Scythians in Ukraine
may have originated in the Altai and moved westward into
the Pontic region early in the nomadic period, about the
eighth century B.C. 3
Up to the present, the study of the artistic aspect of the
material remains of the early nomads has been incorporated
into a search for a cultural context for the interpretation of
the entire archaeological record. However, no consensus
has been reached as to a standard model for the "cultural
ecology" of the nomads. The chief difficulty in this study is
the lack of written records by the nomads themselves . One
attempt to overcome this difficulty is to find parallels in the
cultural traits of ancient civilizations of sedentary peoples
who are supposed to have been related to the nomads in
some way and who did leave written texts regarding their
systems of beliefs — and, to a certain extent, their history.
Based in part on the physiological study of the human
remains in nomadic burials and in part on the writing of
peoples who had early contact with the nomads, it has
been generally assumed that the early nomads were Indo
Europeans, and Indo-Iranians in particular, with some
allowance for the intrusion of Mongoloids in the eastern
4



part of the Eurasian steppes during the Hunnic period. The
terms Indo-European and Indo-Iranian originated in nine
teenth-century linguistic studies and have been extrapo
lated to designate racial or ethnic groupings. The system of
religious beliefs and the practices of early Indo-Iranians
who developed urban civilizations, as recorded in the
Iranian Avesta and the Indian Vedic texts, is then applied to
the interpretation of archaeological finds associated with
the nomads. Thus, for example, "the deer is considered a
totemic vestige occasionally substituted for the horse; the
horse referred to kingship, and its sacrifices to the renewal
of cosmic order; and gold referred primarily, though not
exclusively, to solar values or to the solar- warrior." 4 This
approach is open to certain objections, as has been pointed
out by Esther Jacobson, whose own study is based on the
internal evidence offered by the art of the nomads from its
earliest manifestation in the beginning of the first millen
nium B.C., paying heed to the "cultural integrity" of the
nomads themselves. s
Respect for the cultural integrity of the nomads does not
obviate the study of cultural and artistic exchanges between
nomads and the sedentary societies with which they came
in contact. These exchanges became more prevalent from
about the fifth century onward — the Scythians with the
Greeks, the Saka with the Iranians, and the Siberian
Mongolian nomads with the Chinese. It is not proposed
here to enter into a theoretical debate as to the symbolic
significance of nomadic art at any stage of its history or the
mode of cultural exchange between early nomads and
sedentary populations — particularly in the consideration
of precedence, that is, the questions of who influenced
whom and in what respect. There is already a considerable
body of literature on these questions. 6 Rather, it is pro
posed, in the concluding essay of this volume, to sketch an
outline of the later history of nomadic art, beginning at the
end of the first millennium B.C., a time generally consid
ered too late for the study of nomadic art proper. As the
great majority of the objects in this exhibition are from the
northern border regions of China, and as there is a wealth
of material in later Chinese art that lends itself to analytical
study, our discussion will be concerned mainly with the
aftermath of the intense contact between the nomadic
tribes and the settled populations in North China from
about the second century a.d. onward. Also discussed will
be the survival of certain styles in the arts of eastern Central
Asia in the medieval period that can be attributed to an ori
gin in the world of the Eurasian steppes.
In the next two essays, Emma C. Bunker gives a broader
description of the ecology of the steppes and the peoples
who inhabited it, followed by a detailed account of the
archaeological record of the different regions from which
the objects in this exhibition are likely to have been found.
Her encyclopedic knowledge of the archaeology of this area
provides the basis for attributions as to dating and regional
association and for the discussions in the catalogue entries.
The catalogue is ordered by types of objects rather than
by dates, regional styles, or association with particular cul
tures or groups of people. Nevertheless, it may be pointed
out that there are certain types of objects that can be associ
ated with particular tribes or confederations of tribes. For
example, the helmets (cat. nos. 46, 47), short sword (cat.
no. 4c), and knife (cat. no. 41) are attributed by Chinese
archaeologists to the Donghu group, early inhabitants of
Northeast China. Belt plaques and buckles representing ani
mals in combat (cat. nos. 68, 72, 94, 97, 104), and the sil
ver recumbent horse (cat. no. 101) are considered to be
typical of the Xiongnu. 7 The gold and gold-wrapped plaques
with three deer (cat. nos. 152, 15-4) and the pair of horse
plaques in gilded bronze (cat. no. 85) can be firmly attrib
uted to the Xianbei group, who replaced the Xiongnu in
Mongolia in the first century B.C. More detailed identifi
cation of objects by regional style and by association with
specific groups of people will have to await further study. It
is hoped that the solid information provided in the catalogue
entries will be a major step toward this exploration.

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Emma C . Bunker
Diogenes the Cynic said that manjlrst crowded into cities to escape theJury of those outside. Locked within their walls, they
committed every outrage against one another as if this were the sole object of their coming together. [Beyond the city walls, a
different approach to life developed,] the Nomadic Alternative.
C. Bruce Chatwin, "The Nomadic Alternative," in Bunker, Chatwin, and Farkas 1970, pp. 176, 177
The word "steppe," meaning grassy plain in Russian,
has become synonymous with the vast belt of
Eurasian grasslands that extends west for thousands
of miles from the Great Wall of China into central Europe
(figs. 1 , 2).
1 During the first millennium B.C., it was inhab
ited by groups of pastoral peoples whose economies were
based on a combination of stock raising, herding, hunt
ing, and agriculture, depending on the regional ecology. The
steppe peoples have often been portrayed as wandering bar
barians more intent on raiding and stealing goods from their
settled neighbors than trading with them, but today scholars
are gaining a more accurate picture of nomadic life.
Organized around prescribed seasonal migrations over long
established routes from home camps to known destinations,
which provided water, pasture, and hunting grounds, their
lives were in fact highly structured. In many regions, these
routes are still in use today and comprise the only roads
available across the vast expanse of the steppe (fig. 3). The
Eurasian pastoral peoples were integral parts of larger
regional systems that included settled communities. Over
time, both groups developed strong, mutually beneficial ties,
and the exchanges between them infused both cultures with
a remarkable hybrid vigor that resulted in an explosion of
artistic productivity.
The pastoral peoples of the Eurasian steppes left no writ
ten legacy, but the artifacts that remain provide clues to their

history and cultural beliefs. Beautifully crafted objects made
of metal, bone, wood, and fabric designed to accommodate
a mobile lifestyle, they include personal ornaments, belt acces
sories, horse gear, tools, weapons, mirrors, and small ves
sels, often richly decorated with intricate motifs —animals,
birds, reptiles, and human figures —visual representations
of the natural and the supernatural worlds.
Traditionally relegated to the periphery of art history,
these splendid artifacts have the distinction of being among
the most misunderstood objects in Eurasian history. Known
primarily through chance finds, they have until recently
remained archaeological orphans, without cultural context,
and have been described in a bewildering array of ambigu
ous terms that have little historical or archaeological basis:
animal style, Ordos, Sino-Siberian, Scytho-Siberian, and
Scytho-Thracian. 2 Today, the artifacts from the Eurasian
steppes can be compared with finds from archaeologically
excavated sites, making it possible to attribute them to
regional styles described in terminology based on fact rather
than fiction.
The steppe zone of Eurasia has played a major role in
Eurasian history, although its importance is often over
looked. In antiquity, it served as an important information
highway, connecting east with west and opening up trans
regional trade routes that would be used for centuries, such
as the famous Silk Road through the deserts of Central Asia
and the later Tea Road spanning north and west from Beijing
to St. Petersburg. The nomadic groups that lived on the
steppes were intermediaries in the transmission of many
innovations from one place to another. Wheeled transport,
for example, was introduced into China in the late second
millennium B.C. through contact with neighboring pastoral
peoples, 3 and some four hundred years later horseback
riding was brought into China the same way.
The vast Eurasian land mass is not ecologically homoge
neous, although its grassland belt runs for thousands of miles,
almost from the Pacific Ocean to the North Sea, part of a
beautiful mosaic of deserts, forests, lakes, mountains, rivers,
and seas (figs. 4, c). In the distant past, these areas were not
defined by political boundaries. Today, the main body of the
steppe lies within the borders of the former Soviet Union. 4
To the east it extends into Mongolia and Northeast China,
while to the west it reaches as far as the Carpathian Mountain
range in central Europe. The ancient pastoral peoples inhab
ited not only the grasslands of the steppe belt but also territory
adjacent to the north and south (see the map on pp. xn— xm).
The steppe zone is further subdivided by mountains and
rivers into smaller geographic areas. The Urals and the
Sayano-Altai Mountains effectively separate three major
regions: the Black Sea steppe, the Kazakh steppe, and the
Mongolian steppe, each of which has a distinctive terrain and
ecology. Its many rivers include the Dnieper, the Volga, and

the Don, which flow southward into the Black and Caspian
Seas in the west, and the Ob, the Yenisei, and the Lena in the
cast, which flow northward into the Arctic Ocean.
China's northern frontier zone, in the southern region of
the Mongolian steppes, is divided by the Taihang Mountains,
which run north to south along the western border of Hebei
Province (fig. 6). West of the Taihang, the land is charac
terized by grasslands conducive to large-scale herding. East
of the Taihang, the mountainous, forested land is more
suited to hunting, trapping, and fur trading, while farther
east, in the Dongbci region, the fertile soil of the Liao River
valley could sustain limited agriculture, hunting, fishing, and

settled stock breeding. Each of these regions influenced the
economic development of the local inhabitants and is
reflected in their material culture
The early inhabitants of the Eurasian grasslands were true
environmentalists. They strove for harmony with nature and
exploited only those natural resources essential to their sur
vival and well-being. Land was carefully conserved, and
water was considered sacred. Today, tragically, outsiders
are encroaching upon the terrain, polluting the waters and
destroying the delicate ecological balance of the land.
Until the end of the second millennium b.c. , the pastoral
peoples lived in basically sedentary communities ,with some
9



agriculture and animal husbandry, producing only a limited
range of artifacts, mainly small weapons and tools but few
personal ornaments. By the first millennium B.C., many
groups had turned increasingly to large-scale livestock breed
ing, herding, and hunting (fig. 7). The development of a
more mobile lifestyle was the result of different factors in
each geographic region — climatic and environmental changes,
economic pressure from other groups, and the need for more
pasture to sustain larger herds. This shift was made possible
by the introduction of horseback riding, which occurred
sometime during the second millennium b.c. j In some areas,
grain and other necessities were obtained by force or by
barter — for animal products — with settled communities,
and as pastoral groups became more mobile, commercial
ventures expanded, resulting in consumer networks and sea
sonal trading centers that have prevailed for centuries (fig. 8).
Pastoral economies went hand in hand with cultural val
ues. Animals, both wild and domesticated, provided the
most essential resources for sustenance: wool, leather, and
fur for clothing and for the coverings of portable dwellings;
dung for fuel; meat, butter, milk, and cheese for food.
Horses were used as pack animals and for riding and pro
vided fermented mare's milk, or kumiss, a favorite alcoholic
beverage (fig. 9). 6 In the pastoral world, animals were part
ners with humans in a mutually beneficial relationship that
ensured the survival of both.
The lives of the pastoral peoples were by necessity guided
by the seasonal demands of herding, hunting, the raising of
livestock, and the ecology of their environment. In the spring
and summer, mounted herders, highly sophisticated in their
knowledge of livestock management, followed the seasonal
routes that had been established over the centuries to find pas
ture and water. At the approach of winter, they returned to
home camps for shelter and for fodder for their herds.
The steppe peoples did not exist in isolation. Often they
formed confederations that included peoples taken in con
quest or that were formed by alliances with other ethnic

Tales of the "Scythians" by the fifth-century b.c. Greek
historian Herodotus (on this term, see the essay by James C. Y
Watt in this volume) 7 are matched by those of the first
century b.c. Chinese historian Sima Qian, who devoted an
entire chapter of the Ship (Records of the Grand Historian)
to the Xiongnu, whom he described as tent dwellers who
"wandered from place to place pasturing their animals" on
the northern borders of China. 8 "The animals they raised
consist mainly of horses, cattle and sheep, but include such
rare beasts as camels. They move about in search of water
groups. As a result of seasonal migrations, trade, intermar
riage, and, occasionally, warfare, they were also in contact
with civilizations on their southern and western frontiers. In
the Near East, there was intercourse with the Assyrians,
Urartians, Medes, Achaemenids, and Parthians, and, in the
Black Sea area, the Greeks. In the Far East, they interacted
with the dynastic Chinese (hereafter referred to as the
Chinese). And although they left no written records them
selves, references to these groups and to their customs are
frequent in the ancient literature of neighboring cultures.



and pasture. In burials, the Xiongnu use accessories of gold,
silver, clothing and fur, but they do not construct grave
mounds." 9 Also in the first century B.C., the Greek author
Strabo wrote that the Roxolani, a branch of the Sarmatians,
had "tents made of [felt] that were fastened to wagons in
which they spent their lives. Round about the tents were the
herds which afforded milk, cheese, and meat on which they
lived. They followed the grazing herds, from time to time,
moving to other places that had grass." 10 The prowess of the
steppe peoples in warfare is described by many ancient writ
ers. Herodotus speaks of the great fighting ability of the
Scythians 1 and the Thracians, 12 while Sima Qian notes the
mounted archers whose skill would inspire King Wuling of
the state of Zhao to adopt — in an edict traditionally dated to
307 B.C.' 3 — horse gear, riding clothes, and all the accou
trements associated with horses and horseback riding to
improve the efficacy of his mounted troops.
The first-century Chinese historian Huan Kuan wrote in
the Yan tie lun (On Salt and Iron) that the Xiongnu lived in
qionglu (dome-shaped) tents. 14 Qionglu refers to an early type
of ger, the typical steppe trellis tent that has a round, felt
covered, portable framework of wooden poles (fig. 1 o); it is
also called a yurt (a Russian word borrowed from Turkish
that means "home territory" or "campsite"). s As noted by
Strabo, this type of portable dwelling was on occasion
mounted on a wheeled cart similar to the covered wagons of
the American West to transport the belongings of the
herdsmen. The ger is so well suited to pastoral mobility that
it continues in use today (fig. 1 1 ). 16
Felt, one of the most ingenious products of the north, 17
was used by the Scythians 1 and the Xiongnu, 1 and has been
found in the frozen fourth-century tombs of Pazyryk in the
Altai Mountains of Siberia (fig. i2). Jo Made by beating,
spreading, wetting, and then rolling large quantities of wool
to produce a fabric of matted wool, felt still is used for cloth
ing and to cover ger frames (fig. 13).
The major economic asset and prize possession in the
steppe world was the horse, and remains so today. Ready
mounts are always available, tied next to every ger, like a
parked car (fig. 14). Gas stations in the steppes are few and
far between (and most often closed), so that the use of horses
continues to be of paramount importance, even in the twenty
first century. Displays of horsemanship still are featured at
yearly festivals, especially horse racing and local versions of

buzkashi, the wild equestrian sport of "goat-grabbing," in
which mounted riders skirmish over an animal carcass and
try to place it in a designated goal or scoring circle. 21
Also popular as a sport and display of male prowess was
wrestling, which appeared as early as the third century B.C. 22
It is still practiced at annual festivals, such as the Mongolian
naadam, throughout the steppes. The winner of such a contest
today is frequently awarded a fine horse (figs. 1 r, 16).
Despite all the references in ancient sources to the vari
ous pastoral groups, the early historians' main concerns were
the regions these groups inhabited and the political alliances
they established with their neighbors rather than with their
values and beliefs. 23 Little about their material culture
appears to have been of interest. To learn about their cul
tural achievements, relationships with nearby settlements,
and contacts with other, more distant Eurasian cultures, we
must turn to the artifacts themselves.

friihen Steppenvblker ( 1 964), translated into English as Art of the Steppes in
1967. Some regions are not true steppe, but taiga (forest) and desert
steppe. The term "pastoral" is used here to refer to dependence on
domesticated herd animals held as property; see Chang and Koster 1 986,

some scholars in the past.

in Turkish, and oxygaia in Greek, fermented mare's milk was also a
favorite beverage of the Scythians, as noted by Herodotus.

ARTIFACTS: REGIONAL STYLES AND
METHODS OF PRODUCTION
Emma C . Bunker
All the steppe peoples displayed a proficiency in metal
working. They produced small personal weapons
with integrally cast hilts; personal ornaments of
metal to signify status and clan affiliation; and a distinctive cos
tume consisting of a short jacket, trousers, and a prominent
belt, frequently hung with tools and weapons. Although their
lifestyles were animal-oriented and their artifacts typologically
similar, they did not all belong to one vast cultural continuum,
as has frequently been suggested. 1 Rather, each regional group
retained its own identity. And although they were culturally
and technologically interconnected, their material remains
have distinguishing characteristics.
Distinct artistic vocabularies were also developed. Stylistic
motifs — derived from myth, local fauna, and domesticated
animals — gave visual expression to customs and beliefs,
each one imbued with meaning that pertained to spiritual
and cultural values 2 Even today such motifs are emblems of
clan, rank, family, and kinship. In a culture in which history,
religious beliefs, and codes of ethics were transmitted by oral
and pictorial — rather than written — accounts, art served
as a powerful binding force.
The flowering of creativity among the Eurasian pastoral
peoples during the first millennium B.C. appears to have
accompanied the transition from a settled agro -pastoral
lifestyle to one that was more mobile and more dependent
on herding, hunting, and the marketing of animal products.
From their very beginnings, the peoples of the Eurasian
steppes placed a greater value on animals than did their
sedentary neighbors to the south and imbued their artifacts
with a distinctly northern flavor. This quality is recognizable
in the type and decoration of the implements and ornaments
they designed and that they embellished with zoomorphic
motifs that served as status symbols and clan markers
In the past, pottery and patterns of burial have been the
primary factors in distinguishing regional cultures in the
Eurasian steppes. More recently, based on results of archae
ological excavations — most of which were made in China by
the Chinese in the latter half of the twentieth century
these cultures can also be identified by metal artifacts. Many
such artifacts have been assigned dates within a relative
chronology based on stylistic and metallurgical comparisons
with material from sedentary communities, but the accuracy
of these dates is questionable. It is hoped that in the future,
radiocarbon analysis of excavated material combined with
the comparison of artifacts will result in greater accuracy 3
Within each geographic region an economic complex was
formed which yielded a range of artifacts that met the needs
of the peoples in that region. The production of equestrian
gear, funerary canopy and cart ornaments, tools, weapons,
and personal ornaments is consistent throughout the
Eurasian steppes, but the visual symbolism that distinguishes
these objects and the metallurgical techniques employed to
make them reflect distinct regional characteristics.
In most areas, people adhered to local metallurgical tra
ditions and a specific range of metals, depending on their
availability and the proficiency of local craftsmen. Correct
identification of the birds and animals represented is essen
tial to understanding an artifact. To a certain extent, zoomor
phic images are area specific and the ability to recognize an
artifact's regional features helps to determine its origin
and authenticity. Nevertheless, trade, migration, marriage
alliances, and warfare frequently involved not only the move
ment of people but the dissemination of objects. Artifacts
can thus document the long-distance contacts that were not
recorded in ancient texts. For example, a third- to second
century b.c. belt plaque made in North China was recovered



from a grave in the Ural Mountains at Petrovka, thousands
of miles west of where it was made. 4
The northern frontier zone of the Eurasian steppes can
be divided geographically into three cultural spheres. North
east China — known as the Dongbei, encompassing Jilin,
Liaoning, and Heilongjiang Provinces, and southeastern
Inner Mongolia — was inhabited by agro-pastoral peoples
whose economies depended on livestock, hunting, and agri
culture. The land was fertile, watered by many rivers, so there
was little seasonal migration . The groups living in northern
Hebei Province were primarily hunters and trappers, who sup
plied furs and other animal products to their Chinese neigh
bors to the south. Long-distance mobility for these peoples was
not a concern. By contrast, west of the Taihang Mountains
in a large area that includes northern Shanxi and Shaanxi
Provinces, southwestern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
Ningxia (Hui Autonomous Region), southeastern Gansu,
and parts of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region — the
regional economies were grounded in large-scale herding and
livestock trading, necessitating the adoption of transhumance,
seasonal migration in search of pasture and fresh water.
Ancient Chinese texts refer to numerous non-Chinese
peoples who inhabited the northern frontier zone during the
first millennium b.c. , but whether these names are the same
as those used by the people to refer to themselves, Chinese
transcriptions of foreign names, or merely generic terms is
difficult to say. Long lists of named groups and their general
geographic locations can be gleaned from ancient Chinese
texts, but little or no information is available concerning
their individual customs and artistic traditions. 5 Such infor
mation remains elusive until the late third century b.c, and
by the first century B.C., when Sima Qian wrote the Shiji,
their separate identities are already lost.
Problems of identity also surround the many Eurasian peo
ples discussed by Herodotus. 6 Only the "Scythians" of the
Black Sea area, whose Central Asian counterparts were
known by the Iranian name of Saka, can be described with
any confidence. The importance of early literary citations is
the repeated reference to those people considered "others,"
alien peoples with whom the Greeks, Iranians, and Chinese
must have had complex and mutually beneficial relationships.
Cultural encounters between these civilizations and their
nomadic neighbors are seldom mentioned in ancient litera
ture but can often be detected in the art of both groups
THE DONGBEI (9TH— 3RD CENTURY B.C.)
The most distinctive artifacts produced in the Dongbei are
knives, short swords, helmets, horse and chariot gear, and
small personal ornaments, including belt decorations, and
implements appropriate for settled agro-pastoral and hunt
ing cultures. The chariot ornaments are frequently equipped
with jingles, typical steppe paraphernalia intended to make
a bell-like sound (cat. no. 26). The jingles themselves derive
from northern metalworking traditions in which, long
before they were produced by casting, they were formed by
smithy work (cat. nos. 26, 28, 29). 7 The small bronze
weapons also exhibit characteristic features — blades that are
integrally cast with the hilts, not separately, as they were in
China (cat. nos. 44, 4c, 49—5-2).
Chariot ornaments decorated with hunting scenes were
a regional specialty of the Dongbei. A fragmentary bone
plaque excavated from tomb 1 02 at Nanshan'gen, Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia, shows a hunter with
drawn bow aiming at two stags while two hunting dogs stand
beside horse-drawn vehicles (fig. 1 7). The two-wheeled vehi
cles are similar in design to those represented on two plaques
in the present exhibition (cat. no. 23). A bronze ornament
(cat. no. 26) shows two mounted hunters accompanied by dogs
pursuing their prey, a counterpart to the bronze ornament

excavated in the Nanshan'gen vicinity, which depicts two
hunters pursuing a wild hare (fig. 1 8) 8 This type of pictorial
decoration appears to have no counterpart in the art of
Northwest China. Instead, Dongbei pictorial traditions may
be traced back to narrative scenes represented on deerstones
(fig. 19) and petroglyphs (fig. 20) that are still visible
throughout Mongolia and southern Siberia, where unex
plored Bronze Age tombs still dot the landscape (fig. 2 i). 9
Closer connections existed between the Dongbei, northern
Mongolia, and eastern Siberia than between the Dongbei and
Northwest China. The geographic location of the Dongbei
gave access to Inner Asia by routes that led north through the
Amur Valley and westward along the so-called Fur Route, a
complex trading network crossing Eurasia north of the fiftieth
parallel. The Fur Route completely bypassed Northwest
China and was roughly the same as that traveled by the Trans
Siberian Railroad today. 10
The zoomorphic motifs that embellish Dongbei orna
ments and weapons feature horses, wild animals, amphib
ians, and birds native to the area. Such representations, often
realistically rendered (cat. nos. 44, 1 cc), are quite distinct
from the stylized zoomorphic symbols on many artifacts pro
duced west of the Taihang Mountain range (cat. nos. 90,
140, 141 ), a region culturally different altogether.
One motif that deserves special attention is the reindeer
with folded legs and flowing, backswept antlers, represented

Mongolia, June 1996. Photo: Emma C. Bunker

on garment plaques and amulets found throughout the
Dongbei and in northern Hebei Province (cat. no. i r8). Its
legs are drawn inward in such a way that they overlap, with
the hooves pointing both forward and backward.
The cervid represented is a reindeer — identifiable by
its brow tines — an image that must have evolved some
where in the heartland of the Eurasian steppes. From there,
it spread east to the Dongbei and west to the Black Sea
region, where it became one of the hallmarks of Scythian
art. 1 An early rendition of this image occurs on a seventh
century B.C. gold fragment from the Ziwiye Treasure found
in northern Iran (cat. no. 168).
Fertility and procreation were also popular Dongbei
themes. 12 Animal copulation and prominent male organs
appear on many artifacts (fig. 22), reflecting a concern with
the propagation of wild game and livestock, on which the
livelihoods of the inhabitants depended (cat. no. iss)- Early
hunting societies must have been far more environmentally
aware than has been acknowledged. By contrast, fertility
symbols and sexual motifs do not occur in the art of the
herding peoples in Northwest China. Rather, it was animal
combat — a subject not depicted on artifacts from the
Dongbei 1 — that was the popular subject matter west of the
Taihang Mountains, where the attack on livestock by wild
animals was a fear and concern. The psychology of the
northeastern hunter was different from that of the north
western herder, and this difference is reflected in the artistic
motifs that gave visual form to the symbolic systems regu
lating their lives.
There is no evidence that foundries in China produced
artifacts designed specifically for Dongbei consumption. The
ritual vessels and other items included among the grave
offerings are orthodox Chinese objects with Chinese decor
that reflected the wealth of the owner but were not designed

southeastern Inner Mongolia (after Bunker et al. 1997, p. 166, fig. 71. 1)

to appeal to his taste. Rather, they are exotica obtained
through trade and demonstrate the lively commercial rela
tions that must have existed between the two diverse cul
tures. Mining and foundry debris discovered in the Dongbei
indicates that other artifacts were cast in local foundries.' 4
Most objects were piece -mold cast, but a few, such as helmets
(cat. nos. 46, 47) and chariot jingles (cat. nos. 26, 28, 29),
were cast by lost wax, as this process was more suited to the
complexities of the designs 1 s
NORTHERN HEBEI PROVINCE ( 9TH — 3RD
CENTURY B.C.)
The material culture of the hunting peoples wrho inhabited
the rugged Jundushan and Yinshan ranges of northern Hebei
Province is different from that found in the Dongbei. The
many funeral canopy decorations, bridle fittings, short
swords, knives, personal ornaments, tools, and other prac
tical items discovered in graves are decorated with zoomor
phic images—representations of the local fauna, such as
leopards, deer, ibex, gazelles, snakes, frogs, and birds.
The burials, situated in large cemeteries rather than in
isolated graves, have been tentatively associated with a non
Chinese group referred to in ancient texts as the Shanrong,
a hunting people known to have supplied the Chinese with
fur and leather goods. 16 In northern Hebei, fur trading and
leather tanning are still major occupations today, especially
in Zhangjiakou, a city that throughout history has served as
a point of departure for northern Eurasian destinations,
such as Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia and Lake Baikal in east
ern Siberia.
The most distinctive artifacts are pectorals (cat. nos.
1 55—157), which appear to have been more prestigious than
the many small ornaments attached to necklaces and belts
(cat. no. 139). The repetition of a limited number of
zoomorphic motifs suggests that pectoral designs were a sign
of kinship ties and beliefs and the hierarchy of metals used an
indication of status and rank. Those of higher rank wore gold
pectorals (cat. no. 1 56), some of which had turquoise inlays
(now often missing). Pectoral designs also appear to have
been gender specific. Men's pectorals were primarily leop
ard shaped (cat. no. 157), while pectorals depicting frogs
encircled by snakes were favored by women and may have
symbolized fertility (fig. 2 3) 1
Figure 2 3 . Pectoral ornament in the shape of a frog encircled by
snakes, northern Hebei Province. 6th—^th century B.C. (after Bunker
et al. 1997, p. 188, no. no)
The most unusual artifacts found in northern Hebei are
bronze finials surmounted by standing animals that were cast
by the lost-wax process (cat. nos. 24, 25). Similar lost
wax-cast bronze finials surmounted by standing wild sheep
(fig. 24) were discovered at Arzhan, a site dated from the
seventh to the sixth century B.C. in Tuva, in southern Siberia. 1
Apparently, these were used to decorate the corner poles of
canopies that had been placed over biers during funeral
rituals, a function also suggested here for the Hebei exam
ples. This is a custom that can be traced back to the third
millennium B.C. burials at Maikop, in southern Russia, as
noted below (note 1 on p. ^6).
Small weapons, especially short swords, are prominent
among the grave goods in Hebei burials, where they are
found at the waist of the deceased attached to belts, essential
items in a hunter's toolkit (fig. 25). Some small weapons
from northern Hebei are quite unlike those of the Dongbei.
One sword (cat. no. 54), for example, has a much shorter
blade marked by a raised median ridge, a feature not found
in the Dongbei (cat. no. 45-). The median ridge, a device for
strengthening the blade, is seen in the early Bronze Age,
where it occurs on a short sword excavated at Zhukaigou, in
the Ordos Desert region (fig. 26). 19 The scabbard of the
Hebei sword has a bronze cover cast with an openwork
interlace design punctuated by turquoise inlays. This design
derives from the interlace dragon patterns seen on sixth
century B.C. bronze ritual vessels cast in North China,

suggesting that such weapons and scabbards may have been
made by Chinese metalworkers for northern consumption. 50
A more abstract type of interlace pattern embellishes the
guard and the pommel of another short sword in the exhibi
tion (cat. no. ^6). The distinctive openwork hilt featuring
animal heads in the round is a type of hilt decoration found
on short swords excavated in the Ural Mountains in the
west, evidence of long-distance cultural continuity that
appears to have existed between pastoral communities in the
east and those in the west, a subject that has yet to be fully
explored. 21
Certain types of horse bits in some of the early-sixth
century B.C. graves at Yanqing, north of Beijing, were
designed specifically for riding (fig. 2 7). 22 The presence of
these bits, along with animal-shaped cheekpieces (cat. no. 3),
indicates that riding astride was practiced in the north and
perhaps even in a few of the northern feudal states, during
the Spring and Autumn period (770—481 B.C.), long before
the introduction of mounted warfare into China by Wuling,
king of the state of Zhao, in 307 b.c. 23
The hunting peoples in northern Hebei appear to have
used a combination of metallurgical processes similar to
those of the Dongbei. For simple objects, such as small per
sonal ornaments (cat. no. 139), piece-mold casting was
used, whereas for more complex items, such as finials sur
mounted by hollow ungulates (cat. nos. 24, 2^), lost wax
was the preferred casting method.
NORTHWEST CHINA (9TH-4TH CENTURY B.C.)
Northwest China was culturally subdivided into three sepa
rate areas defined by distinctly different material remains.
One pastoral group occupied the region just west of the

Taihang Mountains in south-central Inner Mongolia, includ
ing parts of northern Shanxi; another group was centered
farther west in the Ordos Desert and included northern
Shaanxi; and the third group occupied an area encompass
ing southern Ningxia and southeastern Gansu, centered in
the vicinity of Guyuan and the Qingyang plateau.
The archaeological remains of the pastoral groups living
west of the Taihang differ noticeably from those found at
sites east of the mountain range, as did their lifestyles. The
inhabitants in the west were chiefly mobile herders in search
of pasture, while those in the east were settled stockbreed
ers and hunters. The most prominent artifacts are belt
plaques, small weapons, and funerary cart and canopy orna
ments, all decorated with zoomorphic motifs, occasionally in
predatory scenes. In the northwest, the use of tinned bronze
was an emblem of status, while in the northeast status was
signified by gold, evidence of significantly different metal
working traditions on either side of the Taihang.
SOUTH CENTRAL INNER MONGOLIA
The most characteristic artifacts found at burial sites in
south-central Inner Mongolia, especially in Horinger and
Liangcheng counties, are short swords, belt plaques, and
hook buckles. Eight plaques similar to cat. no. 37 and dated
from the sixth to the fifth century B.C. were recovered from
a disturbed grave at Fanjiayaozi, Horinger county. Each
plaque is cast in the shape of a crouching carnivore consuming
a herbivore, of which only the head remains. The introduction
of scenes of animal predation on northern frontier zone belt
plaques roughly coincides with their appearance on late
Spring and Autumn bronzes cast at Houma, the Jin foundry
in southern Shanxi Province (fig. 2 8). 2 The carnivore in
another animal predation scene that occurs on belt plaques
excavated at the nearby site of Guoxianyaozi, Liangcheng
county,^ is shown in an awkward half- crouching pose with
flexed legs, a position also seen in the artistic vocabulary at
Houma (fig. 29), providing visual evidence for the close rela
tionship that existed between the state of Jin and its north
ern neighbors. 26
Several other plaques at Guoxianyaozi are shaped like rap
tors' heads similar to catalogue no. 140. These appear to be
stylized abstractions of eagles' heads, such as those that
decorate a saddle excavated at Bashadar (fig. 30), the sixth
century b.c. site in the Altai Mountains, 27 indicating indirect
long-distance contact with pastoral groups far to the north.
The importance of belt ornaments as status symbols
among the pastoral peoples west of the Taihang is confirmed
by their distribution in graves at Maoqinggou, a major ceme
tery site in Liangcheng county dated typologically to the sev
enth through the third centuries B.C. 28 The choice between
such metals as plain and tinned bronze, and, in later tombs,
iron was another indication of prestige and status. Of the
seventy -nine graves at Maoqinggou, twenty-eight contained
belt ornaments and seven of the twenty-eight, large feline
shaped plaques. The men were buried with short swords sus
pended from belts adorned with plaques. One female burial,
Mr, dating from the late sixth to the fifth century B.C.,

yielded a complete belt with two large tinned bronze
plaques, each representing a stylized standing tiger with
prominent claws, whose anatomical details are marked by
indented lines (fig. 31), suggesting that the owner must have
had some special status. Unlike the occupants of the male
graves, the female in Mr was not provided with weapons.
The smaller belt plaques on the belt from mi~, like cata
logue no. 89, are quite different in style and design from
those at the two earlier sites, Fanjiayaozi and Guoxianyaozi.
The small plaques have S-shaped designs represented by
sunken lines that derive from abstract zoomorphic forms
similar to those represented on late Spring and Autumn
22



bronze and jade items found at Shangcunling, Henan
Province. 29 Some of the grave goods also include Chinese
style belt hooks. By contrast, the obvious source for the
standing tiger on the belt plaques from mc are the felines
carved on a sixth-century B.C. wooden coffin at Bashadar, in
southern Siberia (fig. 32). The combination of styles at
Maoqinggou suggests some connection with both China and
the pastoral peoples far to the north, presumably through
marriage alliances and trade
THE ORDOS DESERT REGION
The most characteristic artifacts from the Ordos Desert
region are animal figures cast in the round to embellish vehi
cles used in burial rituals (cat. nos. 31, 3c, 37—39). The
finials surmounted by ungulates (cat. nos. 36, 38) are typo
logically similar to finials from northern Hebei Province (cat.
nos. 24, 25), but they are cast by a different method. The
Ordos examples are piece-mold cast, while those from
Hebei are cast by the lost-wax process, suggesting that the
two are not directly related but, instead, derive from a
shared heritage. While piece-mold casting was more typical
of Chinese foundry practices during this period, it may be
that Chinese craftsmen in sedentary communities were
involved in producing artifacts for the nomadic herders as
they moved from one place to another on the northwestern
frontier. In this case, the artifacts were probably made by
craftsmen in the predynastic state of Qin. Some Ordos finials
are tinned (cat. no. 38), indicating that the person interred
must have been someone of influence and prestige. Tinning,
23



a surface enrichment also practiced by the Qin, was used to
indicate status in the Ordos region until it was superseded by
gold and silver in the late fourth century B.C.
Numerous animal figures from the Ordos have been
identified as yoke covers by their association with a wheeled
vehicle excavated at Yulongtai, Jungar banner. 30 Each animal
is cast with a hollow, open body that fits over the yoke of a
cart (cat. nos. 31, 3c, 37), as do similarly designed animal
figures excavated from a Qin tomb at Bianjiazhuang, Long
county, southwestern Shaanxi Province. 3 ' Yoke covers were
made in sets (cat. no. 32), many of which have been broken
up over the years, such as catalogue no. 37.
Some animals on yoke covers are shown recumbent (cat.
nos. 31, 3 r). This pose is quite different from that of the
ungulate images found on artifacts in the Dongbei, which seems
to suggest speed (cat. no. 2). In the Ordos, the animal is the
red deer shown in a recumbent pose (cat. no. 3^). The legs
overlap, and the undersides of the hooves on the forelegs
face up, while those on the hind legs face down. The pose
derives from Qin artistic conventions, as seen on a lacquer
animal from the sixth- century B.C. tomb of a Qin duke, 32
and can be traced back to the Shang dynasty (ca. 1^23
ca. 1027 B.C.). 33 This particular articulation of the hooves
also occurs, surprisingly, in a fifth-century B.C. context in
the Black Sea region. There is as yet no explanation for its
sudden appearance in the west. 34
Many small garment plaques made of bronze appear to
have been mass-produced by piece-mold casting. 35 Most of
these, similar to catalogue nos. 148, 149, are chance finds
without cultural context, so it is difficult to determine their
precise dates and provenance.
SOUTHERN NINGXIA AND SOUTHEASTERN GANSU
The artifacts associated with the pastoral peoples of southern
Ningxia and southeastern Gansu display a highly complex
cultural admixture compared with those of the Ordos
region. Grave goods include yoke covers, harness orna
ments, and large, impressive belt buckles of diverse styles,
casting techniques, and zoomorphic motifs. Animal-shaped
yoke covers are commonly found in graves. Typologically
they are the same as yoke covers from the Ordos, but with
one minor difference: they are cast with open-ended muz
zles, a distinguishing local feature (cat. nos. 32-34).
By contrast, the harness ornaments and belt plaques from
southern Ningxia and southeastern Gansu are distinctly dif
ferent from grave goods in the Ordos. The harness fittings
are mainly small bridle ornaments (cat. nos. 8, 11, 12) and
larger decorative plaques, such as the superb coiled wolf,
catalogue no. 7, which relates stylistically to late-sixth-cen
tury B.C. images found far to the west — for example, a bri
dle ornament from Simferopol, a major Scythian site in the
Crimea (fig. 33). The motif of an animal curled into a ring
has an East Asian priority and occurs on numerous Western
Zhou (ca. 1 ith century— 771 B.C.) bridle ornaments and on
Mongolian deerstones. 36 Coiled feline images have also been
discovered on artifacts in the Dongbei and northern Hebei,
and a large coiled feline plaque was excavated at Arzhan, a
seventh-to-sixth-century B.C. site in the Sayan Mountains
(fig. 34). 37 The motif was transmitted to Central Asia,
where it appeared in Saka art (cat. no. 138), and farther west,
where it appeared in Scythian art, such as the Simferopol
example, although the connecting links remain obscure. 38
Perhaps the most distinctive artifacts from the Ningxia
Gansu region are large belt plaques that depict some form of
animal predation in which a standing carnivore is shown sav
aging a mangled herbivore (cat. nos. 63 , 94). The buckles are
Figure 33. Bronze horse bridle ornament, Simferopol, Crimea. Late
6th century B.C. (after Artamonov 1969, pi. 78)



Figure 34. Bronze harness ornament in the shape of a coiled feline,
Arzhan, Tuva Republic, southern Siberia. 7th—6th century B.C. (after
Basilov 1989, p. 2o)
cast in the shape of a pair of mirror -image plaques that are fre
quently tinned to achieve a pleasing silvery surface. This type
of buckle had an earlier priority in the Tagar culture of
Minusinsk, Siberia, 39 and among pastoral groups in the Altai
Mountains, 40 suggesting long-distance commercial ventures
between Minusinsk, the Altai, and the Guyuan — Qingyang
region, as such buckles do not appear during this period in the
Ordos vicinity. 41
The animal-combat motif, which derives from earlier tra
ditions in West Asia, probably served as an emblem of power
for herders, who had to protect their stock and grazing lands.
As the motif was transmitted eastward, the West Asian lion
and the panther were replaced by the tiger, leopard, and
wolf, local East Asian predators.
History provides much evidence of contact between the
peoples of the steppes and West Asia in the first millennium b.c.
The Assyrians and the Iranians are known to have reinforced
their cavalries with mercenaries and riding horses imported
from the mounted pastoral peoples of the eastern frontiers
of Central Asia. 42 Cyrus the Great, the Achaemenid ruler of
Iran, met his death in C30 b.c. while fighting the Massagetae,
a horse-riding people that Herodotus placed east of the
Caspian Sea. In C19B.C, Darius I led a campaign against the
Saka in Central Asia in the vicinity of the Oxus River (Amu
Dar'ya), precipitating the displacement of certain Saka
groups farther east across the Eurasian steppes, perhaps to
the western borders of China. 43
By contrast, some buckles have shapes common to the
steppes but display purely Qin-style decoration, consisting of
raised curls, striations, pseudogranulation, and superim
posed zoomorphs (cat. nos. 62, 9 c), suggesting that such
items were made by Qin craftsmen expressly for pastoral
consumption. 44 Other, smaller belt ornaments display designs
that derive from Chinese zoomorphic images found earlier
on Western Zhou vessels which appealed to pastoral taste, such
as raptors with hooked beaks and curvy wings (cat. no. 63).
The enthusiasm for raptor images (cat. nos. 173, 176) may
refer to falconry, a sport popular among the pastoral peo
ples; it is still practiced today in Northwest China, Central
Asia, and Mongolia (fig. 3 c).
Images of camels occur for the first time in southern
Ningxia, in the decoration of harness and belt ornaments
(cat. nos. 14, ir, 92). The camel, with its big padded feet,
made travel in sandy desert terrain possible, as it did in trans
Asian travel along the Silk Road. Riders of camels were por
trayed as foreigners with big noses, such as the rider on
catalogue no. 92, which documents the perception of an
exotic people on the outskirts of China during the latter half
of the first millennium B.C. The earliest evidence for the
motif in Chinese art appears to be a bronze lamp in the shape
of a camel and rider, excavated from a fourth-century B.C.
Chu tomb at Wangshan, Jiangling county, Hubei Province. 41
Other artifacts display stylistic traits that derive from
the carving traditions of southern Siberia. Bone artifacts tes
tify to the existence of these traditions in southern Ningxia
(cat. no. 17c). With the exception of a few minor fragments,
gold and silver were not major status markers among the
pastoral peoples in the area at this time and have not been
found among grave goods. Instead, tinning continued to be
the major metallurgical indicator of status, and it enhances
the surface of numerous artifacts from the southern Ningxia
southeastern Gansu region (cat. nos. 62, 63, 94, 172). 46
Toward the end of the fourth century B.C., images of
carnivores display raptors' heads at the tips of their crests
and tails (cat. nos. 63, 94), indicating the appropriation of
images associated with nomadic groups living farther north
25

and farther west. 47 Raptor-headed appendages belong to a
little-known symbolic system that suddenly blossomed in the
Ordos Desert region during the fourth and third centuries
B.C. and later appeared as exotica and xiangrui (auspicious
signs) in the art of Han China (cat. nos. 1 6 1 , 1 80).
NORTHWEST CHINA (4TH — 3RD CENTURY B.C.)
The arrival to the Ordos region of peoples from the north
and west who practiced mounted warfare instigated dra
matic changes in the character of grave goods and visual
symbolism. These changes roughly coincide with the Asian
campaigns of Alexander the Great in Central Asia
(ca. 334—323 b.c.) and the introduction of mounted war
fare to the state of Zhao in 307 B.C. by groups referred to in
ancient Chinese literature as the Hu and the Linhu. 48 By the
beginning of the third century b.c, yoke covers had gone
out of fashion and were no longer included among grave
goods, and the chariot, which had played a major role in ear
lier funerary rites of the pastoral elite, became less impor
tant, as primacy was given to the horse rather than to the
horse-drawn vehicle.
The iconography of some artifacts found in the Ordos region
is related to that represented on artifacts found in eastern Central
Asia, and the iconography on others indicates long-distance
associations with pastoral groups in the Altai Mountains. A
spectacular mythological gold ungulate with exaggerated
antlers discovered in northern Shaanxi Province at Nalin'gaotu,
just south of the Ordos Desert (fig. 36), exemplifies the intru
sive iconography that appeared late in the fourth century B.C.
along with an entirely new group of artifacts. And a hierarchy
of metals based on gold and silver replaced tinned bronze as
emblems of high-ranking individuals.
The extraordinary creatures with raptor-headed appen
dages, similar to the creatures tattooed on a man buried in
Pazyryk tomb 2 in the Altai Mountains (fig. 37), belong to a
poorly understood symbolic system employed by certain
Eurasian nomads living between Bulgaria in the west and the
Great Wall of China from the seventh to the sixth century B.C.
to the first century A. d. 49 To date, the earliest known exam
ple of this iconography is a gold goat-shaped plaque with
horns in the shape of round-eyed birds' heads. The plaque
was found in a seventh-to-sixth-century B.C. Saka burial at
Chilikta, eastern Kazakhstan. 50 By contrast, the image
depicted by the Scythians in the Black Sea region is a cervid
with antler tines terminating in raptors' heads that, by the
fourth century B.C., had acquired ears and almond-shaped
eyes, like the Greek and Iranian griffin. This classicizing of a
nomadic motif was the result of increasing Greek involve
ment in the manufacture of Scythian art. Carnivores were
also provided with raptor-headed appendages, especially on
artifacts from Northwest China dating to the late fourth and
third centuries B.C. (fig. 40 and cat. no. 94).
The fact that raptor-headed appendages occur on animals
earlier in southeastern Gansu and southern Ningxia than they
do in the Ordos suggests that the pastoral bands that intro
duced them into the area were mounted warrior herdsmen
who came through the Gansu corridor, China's main route
to the west, and then moved north along the Yellow River
to reach the Ordos. These groups must have come in sev
eral waves from regions in both Central Asia and southern
26

Siberia, as suggested by the new types of artifacts and iconog
raphy in the Ordos region.
The Hu, who appeared on the northwestern frontier and
impressed the king of Zhao with "archery from horseback,"
may have come from farther west and joined the Rouzhi.
According to Sima Qian, the Rouzhi (sometimes given as
Yuezhi) controlled a large confederation of mixed linguistic
and ethnic backgrounds located in Gansu. 51 The Chinese
o
texts describe the Hu as mounted archers and make a clear
distinction between the Hu and the Xiongnu, who had
united all the peoples of eastern Eurasia into a vast steppe
empire by the end of the third century B.C. 5
The artifacts excavated in the Ordos include flamboyant
headdresses, necklaces, ear ornaments, belt plaques (figs.
38, 39), and bridle ornaments, often of precious metals
encrusted with colored stones (fig. 40). The use of silver as
a mark of status, and as a means of achieving a shiny white
surface, appears to have replaced tinning (fig. 41). Many of
these artifacts display metallurgical techniques new to the
area that had been transmitted across the Eurasian steppes
from metalworking centers farther west. 53 The appearance
of these techniques, such as granulation, on China's north
western frontier had a major impact on Chinese metallurgy.
Two of the most important artifacts in the Ordos region
to show such a technique are a pair of gold plaques that
depict an animal combat between a tiger and a wild boar and
display Chinese characters on the back (figs. 42, 43) ; these
refer to the weight of the plaque and the subject matter/4
The subject matter is not Chinese, but the presence of the
characters and the realistic rendition of the animals indicate
that the plaques were cast in China rather than by metal
workers in the Ordos.
The backs of the two plaques display a coarse woven pat
tern which reproduces the piece of textile that originally sup
ported the wax model when it was removed from the

mother-mold in the lost-wax and lost-textile casting process.
This is a variation of the indirect lost-wax technique that was
developed during the fourth and third centuries B.C. for cast
ing artifacts made of precious metals and later for bronze
examples that were to be gilded, tinned, or silver-plated. 55
Several gold artifacts adorned with distinctly northern
subject matter were unearthed from tomb 30 at Xin
zhuangtou near Yixian, Hebei Province^ 6 Many display both
the textile pattern and characters denoting the weight.
During the late Warring States period, Yixian was the loca
tion of Yanxiadu, the southern capital of the state of Yan
from 31 1 until 222 B.C., when the city was destroyed by
the armies of the Qin. It would appear that metalworkers
in Yanxiadu produced luxury items for northern pastoral

peoples that were designed to appeal to northern taste; on
rare occasions, they would depict an individual identifiable as
a nomad who had acquired one of these items (fig. 44).
The major preferences of the pastoral peoples in the
Ordos region during the late fourth and third centuries B.C.
included the extensive use of precious metals, the represen
tation of fantastic mythological animals, a range of artifacts
not seen earlier in the region, new metalworking techniques,
and major Chinese involvement in manufacture. Curiously,
these features did not spread eastward into south-central
Inner Mongolia and the Dongbei and were of only minimal
importance in the Ningxia and Gansu areas at this time.
NORTH CHINA (3RD— 1ST CENTURY B.C.)
By the end of the third century b.c. , the Xiongnu had unified
all the pastoral groups of East Asia into a vast steppe empire
that rivaled the Han state which had recently come to power
in China. The complex organization of the Xiongnu empire
stretching from Liaoning Province in the east to Xinjiang in
the west and northward through Mongolia to Lake Baikal
and the Yenisei River valley in eastern Siberia— was repeated
by many of the great seminomadic states that were to follow.
The creation of the empire was accompanied by substan
tial changes in the metallurgy and iconography of belt
plaques (the most important indicators of clan and status)
and by an increase of Chinese luxury goods, such as lacquers
and silk, in burials. The lost-wax and lost-textile technique
continued to be used to cast plaques of precious metal, such
as the superb silver horse in the collection of the
Metropolitan Museum (cat. no. 101) and bronze plaques
that were to be gilded, such as catalogue nos. 67, 68, 73,
76, and 77. The majority of these items were produced in
China proper or locally by Chinese metalworkers in the
employ of the Xiongnu (there is no evidence that the
Xiongnu themselves practiced mercury gilding, a chemical
gold-plating technique invented in China in the fourth cen
tury B.C. by Daoist alchemists searching for man-made gold).
One buckle, catalogue no. 7 r;, represents the same scene as
catalogue no. 68 but is not gilded and has no textile pattern
on the back. This would suggest that it was cast at a differ
ent workshop, as its style as well as its casting method is
completely different.
Casting models (cat. no. 112) used to create a mother
mold, in which a wax model of a plaque to be cast is formed,
not only facilitated the production of identical plaque designs

at more than one metalworking center but promoted mass
production. The iconography of the Xiongnu displays a shift
during the second and first centuries B.C. from that of the
pre -Xiongnu pastoral peoples in the northwestern Chinese
border areas away from the representation of composite fan
tastic creatures with raptor-headed attributes to a renewed
interest in real animals and people, frequently shown in an
abbreviated landscape setting (cat. nos. 79—81, 108, 116).
Many belt plaques depict ungulates antithetically posed on
either side of a tree or vegetal form, a scene associated with
fertility in the Near East, where it originated. Whether the
scene carried the same meaning among the Xiongnu is not
known, but fertility would surely have been a focus of inter
est in a herding economy, in which the increase of livestock
was of major importance.
Belt buckles and plaques dating to the Xiongnu period
have been recovered in quantity from burials in both
Northeast and Northwest China. 57 The plaques are deco
rated with a limited number of zoomorphic scenes, which
may indicate clan affiliation, and the alloys of some of them
contain arsenic. The artifacts with arsenic are similar to
Xiongnu material excavated in Buryatia, where the Xiongnu
summer camps were situated, and in Mongolia, the seat of
power, both areas where arsenic can be detected in the cop
per alloys. sS
The Xiongnu are first mentioned in ancient Chinese texts
as owing allegiance to the Ruizhi before they conquered the
tribes in East Asia, including the Ruizhi, to form their
empire/ 9 although the lengthy prehistory frequently attrib
uted to the Xiongnu cannot be substantiated either archaeo
logically or in the texts. 60 The Xiongnu have frequently been
associated with the Ordos sites that yielded artifacts showing
the mythological creatures with raptor-headed appendages
But, in fact, it could not have been the Xiongnu who
brought this iconography to China's northwestern borders.
First, there is no indication that they were in this region
during the fourth century B.C., when these motifs first
appeared. The few plaques adorned with such creatures
(cat. nos. 67, 68, 72, 76, 99, 103) must instead have
belonged to the conquered Ruizhi, who were absorbed by
the Xiongnu confederation. Second, with the rise of the
Xiongnu and the subsequent expulsion of the Ruizhi between
176 and 160 B.C., the depiction of raptors' heads decreases
significantly and eventually disappears from the visual vocab
ulary of the area. 61
The mythical animal most favored by the Xiongnu was a
sinuous, lupine-headed dragon that must have been an amal
gamation of steppe and Chinese features (cat. nos. 17, 102,
1 oc). The earliest representation of this image occurs on a
gold belt buckle excavated at Szidorovka, a site near Omsk
in western Siberia dated to the late first millennium b.c.
(fig. 4c). The dragon is shown being attacked by two tigers,
a combat scene identical to that represented on a pair of
bronze openwork plaques discovered in a female Xiongnu

burial at Ivolga, Buryatia, dated to the second century B.C.
(cat. no. 10c). Plaques cast with openwork designs were
probably backed with colored fabric or leather to imitate the
color achieved by the earlier inlay tradition. 62 An openwork
jade plaque in a private collection in London (cat. no. 1 06)
depicts the same scene and may also have been backed with
colored material. The jade is a dark green nephrite visually
similar to nephrite found in northern Mongolia and eastern
Siberia, suggesting that it was carved in the north rather than
in China itself. 63
The discovery at Szidorovka of the gold buckle with the
lupine-headed dragon suggests that the Xiongnu may originally
have come from much farther west than has heretofore been
realized. A gold plaque in the famous Peter the Great col
lection of Siberian art in the State Hermitage, St. Petersburg,
that also depicts a lupine headed dragon on either side of a
vegetal motif (fig. 46), is similar in design to a later bronze
version from a Xiongnu burial at Daodunzi, Tongxin county,
Ningxia (fig. 47), which has a dragon not unlike the one on
catalogue no. 102. Interestingly, both the Szidorovka and
the Peter the Great plaques are inlaid with semiprecious
stones and glass paste, and both have a textile pattern on the
reverse, indicating the lost-wax and lost-textile casting tech
nique. 64 The relationship of the Szidorovka buckle to the
Peter the Great plaque, said to have been found somewhere
in western Siberia, adds credence to the idea of the Xiongnu'
more western origin. Further connections with western
Eurasia are demonstrated by the similarities between the
tear-shaped borders that frame the plaques from Szidorovka,
from the Peter the Great collection, and from Daodunzi
and the tear-shaped border on a gold-inlaid plaque in the
exhibition associated with the Sarmatians (cat. no. n^).
A recent article pointing out other similarities between
zoomorphic scenes on Xiongnu plaques and earlier animal
representations in West Asia would also seem to support a
western origin and argues for further scholarly attention. 65
Many artifacts from the Xiongnu culture found in North
China provide a means for comparative dating of objects in
collections formed before the twentieth century, such as that
of Peter the Great. Several large gold belt buckles in that
collection are stylistically and iconographically related to belt

plaques dated to the last quarter of the first millennium B.C.
that have been found at sites in North China. 66 The sixth- to
fourth-century B.C. dates given to many of these objects may
be too early, in view of their similarities to bronze plaques
depicting the same scenes found in North China dating to
the much later Xiongnu period. For example, catalogue no.
72 is a simplified version of a gold Peter the Great plaque,
said to have been found at Verkhneudinsk (present-day
Ulan-Ude), near Lake Baikal (fig. 48), a similarity that calls
into question the fifth- to fourth-century B.C. date tradition
ally given to the Peter the Great plaque. 67 Another gold
plaque in St. Petersburg, depicting a tiger attacking a camel
under a leafy tree (fig. 49), is dated to the sixth century B.C., 68
yet the composition of the animal-combat scene and the style
of the tree relate to examples portrayed on bronze plaques
that do not date any earlier than the late third to second cen
tury B.C. , as evidenced by the date of catalogue no. 78 . These
few observations indicate that a complete reevaluation of
many gold treasures in the Peter the Great collection should
be undertaken in light of recent archaeological discoveries
in China.
Vessels associated with the northern frontier zone peo
ples were piece-mold cast and primarily utilitarian, with
almost no decoration. The complex ceremonies associated
with vessels in China were ill-suited to a herding and hunt
ing lifestyle. The most common steppe vessel was a stem
footed cauldron, called afu by the Chinese (cat. no. 186).
Although the eighth- century B.C. cauldron with Zhou-style
decor in the exhibition was obviously cast in late Western
Figure 47 . Bronze openwork belt plaque with pair of dragons, tomb 1

Zhou China, the shape has no Chinese antecedents and must
copy a non-Chinese example (cat. no. 185"). The origins of
the nomadic cauldron must instead be sought in the west,
where numerous early examples of pottery, wood, and
hammered metal have been discovered, such as a hammered
vessel from the Trialeti cemetery in Transcaucasia,
Georgia. 69 It may be that Chinese metalworkers were the
first to cast a cauldron in this shape, but they must have done
so under nomadic influence, as the vessel shape has a far ear
lier priority in the Eurasian steppes than it does in China.
XIANBEI ART FROM NORTH CHINA (iST— 3RD CENTURY A.D.)
By the end of the first century B.C., the Xiongnu had been
replaced by the Xianbei, who succeeded them as masters of
the eastern steppes. The Xianbei enhanced their belt orna
ments with motifs of animals, both mythological and real
deer, rams, gazelles, and horses, with and without wings
(cat . nos . 117, 1 r 2 — 1 C4) — that reflected their own beliefs
A winged horse that guided an early Xianbei leader and his
people on their migration southward figures prominently in
ancient Xianbei mythology and is depicted on numerous belt
ornaments and plaques (cat. nos. 22, 8r).
Xianbei artifacts are made of gold (cat. no. 152), silver
(cat, no. 22), and bronze (cat. no. 1^3) that was either ham
mered or cast. Some bronze plaques are gold-plated either
by mercury gilding (cat. no. 8r) or by overlaying the sur
face with thin sheet gold (cat. no. 1 C4).

CONCLUSION
The artifacts associated with the hunting and herding peo
ples of the Eurasian steppes appear to have served two main
purposes. On the one hand, their images were totemic and
proclaimed their owners' individual heritage. On the other,
they gave visual form to the supernatural world that guided
their lives. The mythologies of the nomads were closely
related to shamanism, a nature-oriented religion rooted in
the distant past, which stimulated the creation of symbols
that represented the complex relationships between man
and the forces of nature and the supernatural. Small,
portable drums, traditionally made of wood and leather,
have always been associated with shamanism. The bronze
drum body in the exhibition (cat. no. 166) reflects an earlier
pottery or wood construction and perhaps indicates the
presence of shamanism in ancient Dongbei beliefs, but we
would be on dangerous ground if we were to accept this the
ory as fact.
There are no authorities to consult to tell us exactly what
each symbol means, and we must be careful not to impose
our own unsupported interpretations on the past. The art of
the steppe peoples was created to transmit information to
those who saw and wore it, both the living and the dead, but
if we try to attribute specific meanings to the various motifs
and symbols, we run the risk of being profoundly wrong.
Their meanings were not meant for us and can probably
never be retrieved. Instead, the information transmitted to
us through these artifacts is the visual record of countless
incidents of cultural exchange that occurred between the
Eurasian steppe peoples and their settled neighbors. The
peoples of the steppes served as cultural intermediaries
between regions east and west, north and south throughout
the first millennium B.C. The discovery of Han Chinese mir
rors in nomadic tombs far to the west beyond the Oxus
River, for example, attests to the long-distance trade that
existed throughout Eurasia. 70
Since antiquity, a traditional Sinocentric perspective has
so dominated the historical accounts that the role of the
northern pastoral peoples in the development of Chinese
culture has often been misrepresented or overlooked. The
interactions between the herding and the planting worlds
created a hybrid vigor that, in turn, produced the extraor
dinary dynamism which characterizes some of the art cre
ated during the Western Han. Important metalworking
techniques — for example, strip-twisted wire, granulation,
and loop-in-loop chains — were introduced into China by
way of the steppes during the late Warring States period.
Four superb gold buckles in the exhibition (cat. nos. 8 2—84,
86) are excellent illustrations of Sino—steppe contacts. The
omega shape of the buckles derives from the steppes (cat.
no. 71), but the workmanship is Chinese, using western
metalworking techniques transmitted by way of the steppe
peoples into China.
The appearance of northern motifs in the artistic vocabu
lary of China during the first millennium B. c. is a phenomenon
demonstrated by several Chinese artifacts in the exhibition. A
perfect example of steppe exotica in Chinese art is the beak

headed creatures that embellish the lowest register on the
superb Western Han gilded bronze censer from Maoling,
Yingping county, Shaanxi (fig. co). Another example is the
mythical ungulate with inverted hindquarters on a gold horse
frontal from a Han tomb at Luozhuang, in Zhangyu, Shandong
Province. 71 The prototypical Han lupine-headed dragon, with
its partial northern lineage (cat. nos. 7, 102, 10c), represents
the ultimate symbol of Sino—steppe contact. Wheeled trans
port, horseback riding, riding gear, mirrors, ornamental belt
fittings, the scabbard slide (cat. no. 1 70), and lost-wax casting
were also introduced into China through contact with north
ern peoples beyond its frontiers.
Recent publications have presented tantalizing evidence
for the Chinese appropriation of certain steppe architectural
elements, tomb designs, and other features, including tents
and canopies like those excavated at Zhongshan, Hebei. 72
The similarity between steppe kurgan burials and a tomb
filled with horses at Linzi, Shandong, is not so far-fetched
when one considers that nomadic kurgans have been discov
ered near Almaty in Kazakhstan, just west of Xinjiang (fig. c 1 )
As more scholars turn their interests to Sino—steppe rela
tions, a word of caution is in order. Before any conclusion is
reached as to the Chinese appropriation of some aspect of
steppe culture, it must first be demonstrated that the cultural

element in question — the motif or the metalworking tech
nique, and so forth — occurred in the steppes before, not
concurrent with or after, it made its appearance in China.
The most surprising implication of Sino—steppe contact
is the possibility of northern influence on the development of
early plucked instruments in China, such as the se and the
qin. A qin tuner surmounted by a bear (cat. no. 178), a se
string anchor decorated with a coiled beaked ungulate (cat.
no . 180), and a se string anchor surmounted by a mountain
inhabited by wild animals (cat. no. 179) all display images
that derive from the pastoral world beyond the Great
Wall. 73 That a three-dimensional mountain image depicted
on a Western Han se string anchor (cat. no. 179) may also
have a steppe ancestry suggests that contact with the
nomadic world may have been a major catalyst to the devel
opment of integrated Chinese landscape representations
during this period. 74 Incense burners in the shape of moun
tain landscapes (fig. r2) abound with scenes that are compa
rable to those with tiny animals and galloping hunters
represented on nomadic artifacts (fig. ^3) such as on the
spectacular headdress worn by the man buried at Issyk-Kul
in Kazakhstan (fig. $-4).
Trade and tribute were the primary means of cultural
intercourse, fueled by the insatiable desire of the Chinese
for horses, fur, leather, and other animal products. By the
Western Han, the list of desirable imports recorded in the
Yan tie lun (On Salt and Iron) included mules, donkeys,
camels, and horses of many colors and types, plus furs, rugs,
carpets, and all manner of semiprecious stones. 75
The artifacts in the present exhibition are the physical
embodiments of the ever-changing relationships between the
nomads of Central Asia and the settled communities with
which they came in contact. They are the only unbiased tes
tament to the long associations that either went unrecorded
or were misrepresented in the literature. Visual footnotes
to the history of the Eurasian steppes, they not only cele
brate the pastoral peoples who produced them but allude to
the far-reaching impact of the nomads on Eurasian history.
Were it not for the survival of these small but remarkable
creations, a significant link in the cultural history of the
ancient world might have been lost forever.

1. HORSE HARNESS FITTINGS
Harness fittings were used as adornments for horses, which
were so important in the lives of the hunting and herding peo
ples of northern Eurasia. While many bridle ornaments are
typologically the same, they are differentiated by regional
artistic styles and motifs. ' Although we cannot hope to under
stand the precise meaning of the visual symbols that distin
guish these artifacts, the obvious intention was to give horses,
whether ridden or driven, supernatural traits that would
enable them to serve their owners both in life and in death.
One has only to look at the horse decorations discovered in
the frozen nomadic kurgans at Pazyryk, in the Altai Mountains
of southern Siberia, to imagine how spectacular a fully
caparisoned horse could have looked (fig. 12).

northern Eurasia, see Janse 1932.

This small harness fitting is cast in the form of a recumbent
ibex with the head turned back 180 degrees. The ibex is nat
uralistically depicted, with ridged horns and a short beard.
The underside displays a projecting square with holes in each
side, indicating that the fitting probably served to hold and
distribute the strap-crossings of a bridle. The piece was solid
cast by the lost-wax process.
No harness fittings identical to the Thaw example have
been found in archaeological context, but a plaque nearly
identical in shape and function is in the Mildenberg collec
tion. 1 The Mildenberg plaque has been attributed to western
Asia and dated to the late seventh to the early sixth century
b.c. by comparison with an unfinished object decorated with
a similar animal motif excavated at Sardis, Turkey. 2

Two harness ornaments in the shape ofgazelles
Northeast China, 6 th — ^th century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Height i
7/s in. (4.6 cm); width 2
lA in. (^.7 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
Published: So and Bunker 199^, pp. 1 19— 20, no. 3^.
Two sensitively portrayed gazelles in mirror image face one
another on these harness ornaments. Each gazelle is shown,
with folded legs, in profile. The almond-shaped eyes are indi
cated by intaglio lines, and the S-shaped horns are marked by
a row of raised dots between two parallel lines. The place
ment of four loops on the reverse of each plaque, vertical ones
at both top and bottom and horizontal ones at either end, sug
gests that they are harness ornaments, most likely for a bridle.
Each plaque was cast integrally with its loops in a multipiece
mold. The ornaments may originally have belonged to a much
larger set. Another pair of nearly identical fittings is in the
Tokyo National Museum. 1
A plaque from northwestern Jilin Province 2 and a garment
hook excavated at Wudaohezi, Lingyuan county, Liaoning
Province, 3 are also cast in the shape of a gazelle with S-shaped
curved horns and folded legs very similar to the present exam
ples . The pose is characteristic of ungulate images on artifacts
belonging to the hunting tribes of Northeast China and is dis
tantly related to early representations found in southern
Siberia and western Eurasia. 4 This particular articulation of
the legs and hooves is not found on artifacts associated with
Northwest China, because there the ungulates' hooves point
upward and downward, with the soles parallel to a hypothet
ical ground line. (See also cat. no. 3^.)

Cheekpiecejor a bridle in the shape of leopard
Northeast China, 6th— 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Length $A in. (14 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
An attenuated racing leopard forms this cheekpiece for a riding
horse bridle . The divided ends of a headstall cheek strap would
pass through the holes that pierce the leopard's shoulder and
haunch, and the ring end of a snaffle bit would be fitted loosely
around the leopard's midsection. A longitudinal mold mark
visible under the neck and jaw confirms piece-mold casting.
A complete pair of cheekpieces with the same shape as the
present example was published in 1990 by the Hong Kong
Ceramic Society. 1 The particular riding-horse bridle system to
which this cheekpiece belongs was originally developed by the
Scythians in Northwest Asia and then spread eastward across
the Eurasian steppes to the borders of China. 3 The first such
cheekpieces had three holes but were superseded by cheek
pieces with two holes during the sixth to the fifth century B.C.
providing a terminus ad quern for the present example.
Bronze cheekpieces that have vertical attachment holes with
the same bulging sides occur also at sixth-to-fourth-century B.C.
sites in Kazakhstan 3 and among the grave goods in the
fourth-to-third century B.C. barrows at Pazyryk, in the Altai
Mountains. 4

Harness ornament in the shape of a carnivore
Northwest China and southwestern Inner Mongolia,
6th— 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2/4 in. (7 cm); length ^ V2 in. (14 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This harness ornament, cast in the shape of a carnivore clutch
ing a ram in its paws, exhibits an odd combination of feline
and canine features that makes specific identification difficult.
The animal displays all four legs, with five prominent claws on
each paw: four semicircular front claws and one semicircular
dewclaw curved in the opposite direction. The jaws are wide
open, revealing fangs and teeth represented by half circles.
The ears were precast and then cast on by inserting them into
the casting mold. The tail has been broken off.
This powerful carnivore figure derives from earlier south
ern Siberian artistic traditions, exemplified by the fifth
century B.C. carved wooden tigers on harness ornaments from
Tuekta, in the Altai Mountains. 1 The manner in which the
teeth are represented, as semispheres, reflects a wood-carving
tradition. The back is concave, and the head is hollow. Two
vertical loops are provided for attachment, one behind the
haunches and the other close to the edge at the back of the head.
42



The location of the loops and the orientation of the ornament
suggest that it may originally have decorated the breast strap
of a horse's harness. Breast- strap ornaments from southern
Siberian sites, such as Pazyryk, also have a similar shape. 2
Two tiger-shaped ornaments of gold that may have been har
ness decorations were recovered from a disturbed grave at
Nalin'gaotu, Shenmu county, northern Shaanxi Province, 3 and
are quite similar in shape to the Thaw ornament. The ram's
forelegs are shown pointing forward rather than folded under
the body on both the present example and on the rim of a gold
torque excavated at Aluchaideng, Hanggin banner, in the Ordos
Desert region, southwestern Inner Mongolia. 4 The stylistic sim
ilarities between the Thaw ornament and artifacts found in the
Ordos suggest an attribution to Northwest China and south
western Inner Mongolia. Two pieces in the Shelby White and
Leon Levy collection are nearly identical to this one. ?

Strap-crossing in the shape of a coiled wolf
Eastern Eurasia, cth century B.C.
Bronze
Diameter 2 Von. (r.7 cm)
Ex coll.: Anthony Plowright, Paris
This harness fitting, in the shape of a delightful small wolf
curled into a circle, is a device used to distribute the crossed
straps of a bridle. The artisan has ingeniously represented all
four legs rather than just two, as most Eurasian steppe coiled
carnivore images are shown, such as catalogue no. 7. The
wolf's jaws are slightly open, revealing two sharp fangs and
four molars. The ear is indicated by a comma shape that begins
with a spiral at the inner base. The texture of the pelt is sug
gested by striated intaglio enclosures with pebbled areas, sur
face patterns that may have first developed in wood and bone
carving or in stamped leather. The reverse displays thick
folded -over edges and four loops to accommodate the straps.
The ornament was cast by the lost-wax process, indicated by
marks on the back that were left in the bronze by wax joins.
Strap-crossings were introduced into China along with the
chariot during the Shang dynasty but have an earlier priority
in West Asia. 1 To date, no harness ornament cast in the same
style as the Thaw strap-crossing has been found in archaeo
logical context, but the coiled carnivore was a popular image
throughout the Eurasian steppes. The particular carnivore
represented in each geographic region reflected the local
fauna. Panthers were represented in western Eurasia,
whereas wolves and tigers appear in the artistic vocabulary of
eastern Eurasia. The comma-shaped ear with a spiral at the
base appears to be a specifically eastern Eurasian stylistic trait
and occurs on several artifacts in the Thaw collection (cat.
nos. 7, 94).

Strap-crossing in the shape of three bears
Eastern Eurasia, £th century B.C.
Bronze
Diameter 2 /s in. (6 cm)
Ex coll.: Anthony Plowright, Paris
This strap- crossing takes the form of three crouching bears
identified by their very short, stumpy tails — in a circle, each
biting the tail of the bear in front. Each is shown in profile
with only two legs represented. The mouths are open, reveal
ing fangs and teeth, and the ears are indicated by an oval with
a depression in the center. The back of the plaque displays a
44



hollow square frame on four posts that accommodate the
crossed straps of a bridle. The heavy folded edges seen on
the reverse suggest that the ornament was cast by the lost
wax process.
Archaeological research has not revealed any other harness
ornament similar in style to this one. The prominence given
to the bears' sharp claws is related to the claws of the tigers
depicted on a sixth-century B.C. coffin from Bashadar, in
southern Siberia (fig. 32). The ornament appears to be cast in
an as yet unrecognized style of the eastern Eurasian steppes.

Harness ornament in the shape of a coiled wolf
Northwest China, rth — 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2% in. (7.4 cm); width 2% in. (6.7 cm)
Ex coll. : J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection;
Alvin Lo, New York
Published: So and Bunker 199c, pp. 1 29—30, no. 47.
This harness ornament represents a wolf coiled into a circle
and shown in profile. The hind- and forelegs form a smaller
circle within the perimeter of the body. Four claws are shown
on each paw, and the ear is described by an elongated spiral
that begins at the inner edge. The wolf's body is slightly fluted
and marked with finely patterned striations, and a large volute
marks the shoulder and haunch. On the reverse are three
squared attachment loops. The way in which the loops are
formed confirms that the ornament was cast by the lost-wax
process. Each loop was made by placing a thin, unevenly
shaped strip of wax on two projecting round wax posts.
The coiled wolf appears to derive from coiled-wolf images
found far to the west that date to the late sixth century B.C.
rather than from the coiled felines found at earlier sites east
of the Taihang Mountains. 1 A bridle ornament in the shape
of a coiled wolf from a late-sixth-century barrow near
Simferopol, in the Crimea, is startlingly close in concept to
the present example. 2
The Thaw wolf relates stylistically to a similar small coiled
wolf represented on a fitting found at Xinyangxiang, Guyuan
county, southern Ningxia. 3 The artisan who designed the
Thaw plaque has caught the essential lupine characteristics,
including the soft paws and slightly swollen forehead. The
designs on the pelt may derive from a stamped-leather
tradition, or a carving tradition such as that seen on catalogue
no. 1 £9, a bone cylinder from Northwest China. 4 The repre
sentation of the wolf's teeth by semicircles can be seen on
earlier carved wooden artifacts from burials in the Altai. f

Harness ornament with zoomorphic motifs
Northwest China, £th— 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2 in. (5. 1 cm); width 1 /+ in. (3.2 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
This harness ornament is decorated in relief with an unusual
combination of zoomorphic motifs. The upper part displays a
coiled carnivore shown en face with one front and one hind
paw visible, as if seen from above. A curved element that ter
minates in an eared bird's head at one end and a bird's head
with a long curved beak at the other hangs below. The hollow
reverse of the plaque has two squared vertical loops, formed
the same way as those on catalogue no. 7, an ornament in the
shape of a coiled wolf, indicating that the ornament is lost
wax cast.
Harness ornaments with zoomorphic designs similar to this
one have been found throughout Northwest China. 1 Although
no plaques identical to the present example have been exca
vated archaeologically, the similarity of its casting method to
that of the coiled wolf suggests that it can be attributed to the
same geographic region. A bronze harness ornament recently
unearthed in the Honggou Mountain valley, Xinjiang, displays
a bird's head that is very similar to this one. 2

Ex coll.: Madelon Hedden, Santa Fe
This small plaque, used to decorate a horse's harness, takes
the form of a fantastic bird's head. The eye is indicated by a
sunken circular line, the ruff is textured by striations, and the
beak is described by raised curved lines. The reverse reveals
the remains of two attachment loops, and the presence of
mold lines suggests that the ornament was piece-mold cast.
Small metal appliques were made by the Thracians not only
as personal ornamentation but also to adorn their horses. 1
Several small plaques intended as harness decoration and sim
ilar to the Thaw example have been recovered from Bulgaria. 2

s/» in. (4. 1 cm); width 1% in. (6 cm)
Ex coll.: Ariadne Galleries, Inc., New York
These handsome gilded- silver bridle ornaments represent
mythological raptors and carnivores. A diagonal line across
the largest plaque shows wear from rubbing, perhaps by a
leather harness strap. The two largest ornaments were formed
by hammering; the smallest one is lost-wax cast. The surface
details on all three are chased, the outside borders highlighted
by diffusion gilding, a process used in Europe before the intro
duction of mercury gilding.
Although sold as a set, the ornaments display minor
differences in production method and attachment devices.
The largest plaque displays a horizontal tube for attachment.
The middle-sized piece has an attachment loop on the back
that was soldered on, while the squared loop on the smallest
plaque was cast.
The Thracians paid particular attention to the decoration of
their horse harnesses, and many rich equestrian fittings have
been found in burials throughout Bulgaria. 1 Plaques decorated
with whorls composed of three animal heads very similar to
the example in the middle have been excavated from burial
mounds at Mezek. 2 Raptors' heads and carnivores were major
symbols of the Thracians and must have played an important
role in their rich mythology. Obvious stylistic and icono
graphic relationships exist between Thracian and Scythian art
in the frequent use of zoomorphic symbols as an expression of
cultural beliefs

Harness ornament with bird's-head terminals
Northwest China, 4th century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 2 in. (^. r cm); width 1 A in. (4. 1 cm)
Ex coll. : Michael Dunn, New York
This harness ornament is cast in the shape of a round boss from
which depends a curved element with bird's head terminals.
One bird, with a somewhat menacing demeanor, has a short
curved beak, round eye, and prominent ear, while the other
has a longer hooked beak and a smaller ear. The ornament is
tinned on the front to give it a silvery appearance, and the
curved element, which serves as a neck for both birds, is tex
tured by a central pebbled band. A vertical loop is placed
behind the hollow boss, and mold marks indicate that the
piece was piece-mold cast integrally with the loop.
Harness ornaments similar to this one have been excavated
in the Guyuan region of southern Ningxia. ' The type derives
from earlier examples found at Tuekta, kurgan 1 , in the Altai
Mountains, 2 which also depict eared birds' heads. The surface
pebbling indicated by pseudogranulation relates the Thaw
ornament to workmanship by the Qin of the late fifth cen
tury b.c, suggesting that it may have been made specifically
for trade with their pastoral neighbors 3

Harness ornament with owl's head and bird
Northwest China, 4th century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 3 % in. (8.3 cm); width 1 % in. (4.4 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
The shape of this harness ornament is that of a stylized owl's
head with a coiled bird in its beak. The owl's bulging eyes are
formed by a convex boss within a raised circular rim, and the
ruff is described by two openwork loops below the pointed
ear tufts. The pendant bird is so abstracted that it is recogniz
able only by comparison with slightly earlier versions, such as
catalogue no. 11. The remains of tinning mark the surface
around the eyes, and the reverse shows a crude-looking ver
tical loop inside the hollow owl's head. Flashing in the open
ings indicates that the ornament was piece-mold cast.
Typologically related to the other harness ornaments with
pendant bird forms in the Thaw collection (cat. nos. 8, 11),
this one can be associated with the pastoral peoples on the
frontiers of Northwest China. The owl intended may be the
long-eared owl that is widespread throughout Eurasia. 1

Harness ornament in the shape of a camel's head
Northwest China, 4th — 3rd century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 2 in. (j. 1 cm); width 2 5/s in. (6.7 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
This harness ornament is cast in the shape of a stylized camel's
head shown in profile. The eye is represented by a round boss
with a circular rim, and the ear by an elongated oval with a cen
tral depression. An upper and a lower tooth are visible within
the slightly open jaws. The artist has caught the essential char
acteristics of a camel, suggesting even its rather disagreeable
disposition. The silvery sheen of the surface is the result of
tinning the bronze with molten tin. The reverse has a turned
over edge and displays a vertical loop between and below the
ear and eye. The plaque was cast by the lost- wax process.
The camel does not appear in the art of China or that of
the neighboring pastoral peoples until the fourth century B.C.
although the animal had been well known in Central Asia from
the third millennium b.c. 1 The camelid species first intro
duced into eastern Eurasia was the two-humped Bactrian
camel represented here.

This pair of strap-crossings, each one cast in the shape of a

the eyes represented by a round boss surrounded by a raised
circular rim. The back of each ornament has a square frame on
each of four posts to accommodate the crossed straps of a

while the two camels' heads appear to have been lost-wax
cast, with the strap -crossing frames soldered in place.

Set of ten harnessfittings with zoomorphic motifs
North China, 3rd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Max. height 1 % in. (4.4 cm); max. width 1 Vi in. (3.8 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
The ten gilded-bronze ornaments that make up this group of
harness fittings are distinguished by zoomorphic motifs. Three
of the ornaments have scalloped oval shapes and depict rhi
noceros heads seen from above, each flanked by a medley of
antelope heads and hooves. Three other ornaments are circu
lar and decorated with beaked ungulates curled around a



central boss. The three tear-shaped ornaments portray frontal
animal heads, again flanked by antelope features. And the
remaining single fitting shows the same frontal animal head.
The ornaments all have hollow backs with some attachment
loops or broken stubs . They were cast by the lost- wax process
and then mercury-amalgam gilded. A substantial amount of
rust is visible on the stubs that project from each back, sug
gesting that some element in the fastening mechanism was
made of iron.
The presence of a beaked ungulate among the zoomorphic
motifs and the likely use of iron in the fastening mechanism
suggest that these bridle ornaments were made in China
specifically for the pastoral peoples on the northern frontier.
Excavations at Xinzhuangtou, Yi county, Hebei Province, site
of the southern capital of the state of Yan during the late
fourth and third centuries B.C., have yielded similar orna
ments decorated with distinctly northern subject matter that
were locally made but intended for a northern market. 1

Bridlefitting with mythological landscape

Gilded bronze
Diameter 5 % in. (13.7 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Published: Eskenazi 1996, no. 13.
This gilded bronze disk, a bridle fitting, is embellished with a
complex mythological landscape scene in relief. Two horned
and winged dragons stride through a cloudy mountain land
scape as they bite each other's bifurcated tail. Half hidden in
the mountains below are various wild animals: two pairs of
deer, a bear, a wild boar, and two tigers. The fitting, which
is lost-wax cast, is distinguished by a wide circular aperture
with a reinforced inner rim. A red residue is visible around
the edge of the aperture.
A comparable Western Han gilded-bronze disk, described
as a chariot harness fitting, was excavated from a princely
tomb in Qi state south of Wetuo village, Dawu township,
about fourteen miles southwest of the Qi capital in Zibo



City, Linzi district, Shandong Province, 1 and another exam
ple was recovered from the tomb of Tou Wan, the concubine
of Prince Liu Sheng of Zhongshan, at Mancheng, southern
Hebei Province. 2 The function of the disk has been clarified by
the reconstruction of a driving bridle from the tomb complex
of Qin Shihuang Di outside Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, showing
that such a disk served as a cheekpiece for the bridle worn by
the outside chariot horse. 3
The two dragons have fierce-looking lupine heads that
relate them to the dragons represented on several belt plaques
associated with the Xiongnu, such as catalogue nos. 102 and
ior, and the landscape scene populated with wild animals
recalls that on catalogue no . 116. Many artifacts produced
during the late Qin and Western Han are embellished with
similar mountain landscapes. Populated with dragons and wild
animals, they reflect the Daoist belief that such images repre
sent a sacred realm between heaven and earth, and were
therefore appropriate decorations for tomb offerings. 4 The
animals in these fantastic landscapes were frequently inter
preted as xiangrui (auspicious omens), supernatural reflections
of a ruler's authority and benevolence. 5

Strap -crossing with crouching bear
North China, 3rd — 2nd century B.C.
Silver
Diameter 1 % in. (3.2 cm)
A superbly cast crouching bear adorns the domed cap of this
silver strap -crossing. The bear's ruff continues as outward spi
rals at both ends to form the ears, a stylistic feature of bear
representations during the Western Han period. The fitting
has four loops that project from the back of the fitting to form
a strap -crossing device. It is lost-wax cast, and the loops are
soldered in place.
The bear, an animal most commonly found in the northern
forests, was frequently represented on artifacts during the late
Warring States and Western Han periods. Bears may have
signified immortality or rebirth, as they reemerge each spring
after a long period of hibernation.
A bear stylistically similar to this one is seen on a se (zither)
string anchor in the Harris collection, 1 as well as on many
other Han artifacts, such as catalogue nos. 19 and 20. Also
related is a bear head depicted on a belt buckle made for
northern consumption (see cat. no. 68).

Each of these two gilded-bronze bridle fittings represents a

plays a cagelike device, or strap-crossing, formed by an open
square supported by four posts at the corners. The cages were
probably precast and then cast on when the bear plaques were
cast. (See also cat. nos. t;, 15, 18.)

at Xigoupan, Jungar banner, southwestern Inner Mongolia, a
northern site with a late Western Han date. 4"
Such plaques have traditionally been associated with
China's northern neighbors, but whether the present exam
ples were made by Han craftsmen for local consumption or as
items to trade with the pastoral nomads is unclear. The sub
ject matter relates to the design of catalogue no. 1 7, a bridle
ornament dating from the third to the second century b.c.
that was definitely made for the Chinese market.

Harness ornament with winged stallion
Northeast China, 1st century b.c— 1st century a.d.
Silver
Height 2% in. (7 cm); width 5 in. (12.7 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
Published: Lally 1998, no. 21.
A dramatic winged stallion shown in flight over a mountain
landscape with tiny peaks and curved cloud formations adorns
this silver pear-shaped plaque. The same landscape elements
are also present on two other plaques in the Thaw collection,
catalogue no. 2 1 . The ornament was formed by hammering,
and the design worked in repousse from the back with details
enhanced by chasing on the front. Folded over, and showing
considerable wear, the edges are pierced by fourteen small
attachment holes punched through the silver from inside.
The winged stallion, which figures prominently in ancient
Xianbei mythology, is believed to have guided an early
Xianbei leader and his people on their migration southward.
Plaques that depict winged horses are found at numerous sites
associated with the Xianbei people to the north of China. 1
A pair of gilded-bronze pear-shaped ornaments excavated
in Hulun Buir league, eastern Inner Mongolia, and dating from
the first to the third century A.D., are decorated with a simi
lar winged horse. 1 And another gilded-bronze plaque, depict
ing a goat rather than a horse, was discovered in a tomb in
Putuo, Xilin county, Guangxi, and may reflect an elite taste
for the exotic during the Han dynasty. 3

2. WHEELED TRANSPORTATION
Artifacts associated with wheeled transportation include yoke
covers, finials, and jingles or bells, which would have made a
tinkling sound as the vehicle moved. Although referred to as
chariots, which were used in warfare, many of these vehicles
were not exclusively intended for military purposes but were
also used for hunting and transporting goods during migra
tions. The discovery of finials and decorated vehicles in buri
als indicates that they were also used in funerary rituals. Finials
surmounted by animals (cat. nos. 24, 2 c) probably decorated
the corners of funerary canopies placed over the dead during
burial rituals , a custom that can be traced back to southern
Russia, as exemplified by a burial at Maikop dating to the third
millennium b.c. 1

Two chariot-shaped plaques
Northeast China, 8th— 7th century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Heighten. (10.2 cm); width 3)4 in. (9.^ cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
Each of these two plaques represents a two-horse chariot. The
horses are depicted in profile with only two legs in view, while
the chariot is shown as if seen from above. No harness equip
ment is depicted on the horses, but the way the center pole of
the chariot branches into three prongs suggests that they may
have had yoke saddles. 1 The chariot has a square box with a
rounded front and a centrally placed axle with two wheels, each
of which has sixteen spokes. A low diagonal attachment loop
is placed on the reverse side of each plaque behind the horse's
head, and another loop projects sideways from the chariot box.
The presence of flashing within the perforated centers of each
wheel indicates that each plaque was cast in a two-piece mold.
The chariot and two horses are similar to the two horse
drawn chariots with a deer hunter depicted on a carved bone
fragment from tomb 1 02 at Nanshan'gen (fig. 1 7), Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia, a site dated from the
eighth to the seventh century b.c. 2 Both the Nanshan'gen and
the Thaw chariot images are similar in design to those found
in petroglyphs in Mongolia and Central Asia but have a dif
ferent harness arrangement from that represented in Shang pic
tographs, which also do not include horses, indicating that
the northern harness fittings are different from those found
in China. 3

Four finials with wild rams
North China, Hebei Province, 7th— 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Max. height 6 3/s in. (16.2 cm)
Ex coll.: R. H. Ellsworth, Ltd., New York
A standing wild ram with large curved horns surmounts each
of these four finials that once adorned the corners of a canopy used
during burial rituals. The rams' eyes are indicated by rimmed
perforations that pierce through to the opposite side, and the
horns are marked by anterior ridges. The two taller finials, at
the right, each have a loop on opposite sides of the socket,
while the two shorter ones, at the left, have a loop at the back of
the socket and two holes in either side. Some sockets still retain
the remains of the object to which they were attached. The
finials seem to be fashioned of a very dense alloy, and no mold
marks can be detected, indicating that they were cast by the
lost- wax process.
Several finials cast in the same style as these four were discov
ered in non-Chinese graves in northwestern Hebei Province. 1
Others, related technically and stylistically to the present
examples, are included in several Western collections. 7
The custom of adorning canopies and funerary carts used in
elite burial rituals was confirmed by discoveries dating from the
seventh to the sixth century b.c. at Arzhan, near Uyuk in Tuva,
in the Sayan Mountains of southern Siberia. 3 There, the canopy
covering the bier was distinguished by five finials, each sur
mounted by a standing wild ram, one at each corner and one
at the apex. Two of the Arzhan finials have side loops identi
cal to those seen here.
It is not surprising that finials associated with northwestern
Hebei Province reflect contact with southern Siberia. Long
distance trade between the two regions has existed since
ancient times along routes that led through Zhangjiakou and
Ulaanbaatar, the same route followed today by the train that
connects with the Trans-Siberian railroad at Irkutsk.

Finial with standing ibex
North China, Hebei Province, 7th— 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 6/s in. 5 cm); width 3% in. (9.2 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
Surmounting this finial is a standing ibex with prominent
horns and gathered feet. The tips of the ears are broken off,
and the remains of a beard are visible under the chin. The
horns sweep back over the neck and are supported by a strut
that extends to the shoulders. The figure is hollow cast in
the round, and the oval socket is pierced front and back for
59



attachment. The absence of mold seams indicates that the
finial was cast by the lost-wax process.
Like catalogue no. 24a—d, this example must once have
belonged to a set of finials used by the hunting peoples who
inhabited northern Hebei Province during the seventh and
sixth centuries B.C. Finials from this region are lost- wax cast,
while similar finials from the Ordos Desert region of Northwest
China are piece-mold cast (see cat. no. 3 8). Comparison with
the preceding set and the set excavated at Arzhan in southern
Siberia confirms their date and function as funerary canopy
ornaments (fig. 24).

Harness jingle with mounted hunters
Northeast China, 7th— 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Height r in. (13 cm); width 3 K in. (8.1 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
Two mounted hunters with a dog driving a doe toward them
are shown in the round moving along the edge of a bronze
harness ornament with a pendant openwork jingle. On the
opposite side, another hunting dog confronts a raptor's head.
The jingle still appears to have a tiny pebble within it. The
ornament was cast by the indirect lost- wax method, in which
the wax model is formed in a two-piece mold.
Jingles cast with tiny pebbles inside, which would have
made a tinkling sound as the horse moved, were especially
popular among the herding and hunting peoples north of
China during the second and first millennia B.C. They are
found atop weapon and tool handles, harness fittings, and ves
sels and other utensils. Such ornaments are conspicuously
absent among Chinese finds, suggesting that they belonged
exclusively to the northern cultures, where they had specific
ritualistic meanings and functions. 1 Noisemakers and rattles
have always figured prominently in cultures in which some
form of shamanism is practiced, and pebbles, such as those
used in rattles and jingles, are considered to be imbued with
animistic spirits.'
A jingle of this type, with horse and chariot fittings, was
recovered from a burial at Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng county,
southeastern Inner Mongolia. 3 The figures seen here are very
similar to the mounted hunters chasing a wild hare on a

Harness ornament with tiger and bird's head
Northeast China, 7th— 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Max. height 2/4 in. (5.7 cm); width 4^8 in. (10.6 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This hook-shaped harness ornament represents a tiger with a
long tail ending in a simplified bird's head. A doe and two
more felines are depicted on the tail, which serves as a ground
line and forms the hook. Ribbed lines indicating stripes mark
the tigers' pelts, while the doe's body is left undecorated. A
strut connecting the large tiger's jaw to its feet serves as a sus
pension loop. The ornament is lost- wax cast using a wax
model formed in a two-piece mold. The raised spiral line that
encircles the tail may have been formed by the use of a cord
wrapped around the wax model.
Typologically and iconographically related to catalogue
nos. 26 and 28, this harness ornament is also comparable, in
the perforations in the shoulders and haunches, to an orna
ment found in the Irkutsk region of eastern Siberia that dis
plays the same stylistic features and is dated from the seventh
to the sixth century B.C. 2

This harness ornament is hollow cast in the shape of a crouch
ing tiger with bared, jagged teeth and a long, gracefully curved
tail from which a jingle with a tiny pebble inside is suspended.
The shoulders and haunch are indented with concentric
circles, and two rows of pseudobeading mark the tail longi
tudinally. Evidence of wear is visible within the circular sus
pension loop that projects from the tiger's front paws. A mold
mark running the length of the tail suggests that the piece was
cast by the indirect lost-wax process, in which the wax model
was formed in a two-piece mold.

Harness jingle with stag
Northeast China, 7th— 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Height c \'\ in. (13.3 cm) ; width c Vi in. (14 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This hollow-cast harness jingle takes the form of a stag with its
legs extending into two long S-curved loops, each with a
knobbed spherical jingle suspended below and another jingle
suspended beneath the grooved terminal arc. Each jingle con
tains a tiny pebble. The stag's antlers are conceived as twin
parallel rows of four tangent circles that extend over the neck
and are connected by a strut in between and secured by two
other struts attached to the stag's withers. Attachment must
have been accomplished by the two large vertical holes
through the back that show wear around the edges. The
absence of mold marks suggests that the piece was cast by the
lost- wax process. The surface displays a dark green patina
mottled in reddish brown.

Like the other harness jingles in the Thaw collection, this
one can be associated with the hunting and pastoral peoples of
Northeast China. The representation of stags' antlers as a series
of circles tangent to each is an artistic convention introduced
into North China east of the Taihang Mountains sometime
before the sixth century B.C. 1 Images of stags found at northern
sites west of the Taihang do not display this characteristic.

Animal's head harness jingle
Northeast China, 7th — 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Height z 7/s in. (7.3 cm); width 1 % in. (4.4 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This jingle takes the shape of a hollow animal's head in the
round. It is attached to the underside of a flat openwork plaque
depicting a mirror-image design of two animal protomes
joined at the shoulder. The eyes of both the animal's head and
the animal protomes are indicated by round perforations
enclosed within raised rims, and the shoulder of each protome
is marked by a perforation centered within a raised tear
shaped rim. The three-dimensionality of the jingle and the
absence of mold marks indicate that the fitting was cast by the
lost- wax process.
The body markings are similar to those found on several
plaques and other artifacts dated from the seventh to the sixth
century b.c. and excavated at Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia. 1 The jingle itself also
relates the ornament to other harness fittings from Northeast
China that are in the Thaw collection (cat. nos. 26, 28, 29).

Two chariot joke ornaments in the shape of
recumbent rams
Northwest China and southwestern Inner Mongolia,
£th —4th century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Height 2/2 in. (6.4 cm); max. width c in. (12.7 cm)
Ex coll.: Christie's, New York, March 2^, 1998
These two recumbent rams with folded legs are hollow cast,
allowing them to fit over the rounded yoke on either side of
the pole of a two-wheeled vehicle (see also cat. no. 3 2). The
legs overlap, with the hind hooves facing downward and the
front hooves facing upward. Each ram is shown with its
tongue protruding from its mouth. A longitudinal mold line
between the horns bisects the body of each ram, indicating
piece-mold casting. Mold lines along the edges of the horns
indicate that they were cast separately and then soldered on.
Hollow-cast recumbent deer with neatly folded legs are
common among the grave goods of the pastoral peoples who
inhabited the grasslands on the northwestern frontier of China
during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. , but their exact func
tion had long perplexed scholars. The discovery of a set of late
Spring and Autumn period animal-shaped ornaments that fit
over the yoke of a conveyance excavated in a pre-dynastic Qin
state tomb at Bianjiazhuang, Long county, southwestern
Shaanxi Province, solved the puzzle. 1 The specific placement
of the hooves is a local feature of southwestern Inner Mongolia
64



and Northwest China. It derives from a Chinese convention
illustrated by a lacquer animal from the tomb of Duke Jing of
Qin, near Xi'an, Shaanxi, who died in £37 b.c. 2 This type of
yoke ornament appears to have been discontinued during the
third century B.C., when, with the increased practice of
mounted warfare, status came to be associated more with
vehicles than with horses
Originally, these rams must have belonged to a larger set
of four or more identical figures . The two recumbent rams in
the Shelby White and Leon Levy collection are identical to the
pair shown here and most likely belonged to the same set. 3
Yoke ornaments such as these are peculiar to burials of the
herding peoples of the northwest and, to date, have not been
found in burials east of the Taihang Mountains, where
different burial rituals must have prevailed. Animal figures
with a protruding tongue, a feature which indicates that the
animal is in rut, are invariably male. Such an image provided
an appropriate symbol for the nomadic peoples, whose liveli
hoods depended on a proliferating and thriving herd and
whose wealth was measured by its size (see also cat. no. 3 9). 4

Published: Rawson and Bunker 1990, p. 322, no. 20^.
These six alert recumbent does are represented with heads
held erect and legs folded beneath them. The bodies are hol
low to fit over the rounded poles of the two-wheeled vehicles
used in burial rituals. The position of the legs is the same as
that of catalogue nos. 3 1 and 3 r, but the muzzles, with open
ends, are differently cast. 1 The figures are distinguished by
their complex mold marks. One mark bisects the body longi
66



tudinally, while others can be seen on the back of the ear
extending from the base to the tip, indicating that each doe
was cast integrally with its ears in a multipiece mold.
Like the ungulates with scooped-out bodies associated with
the Ordos region, these six does also served as yoke orna
ments, but they were made by nomads inhabiting the grazing
lands of southern Ningxia and southeastern Gansu. The cir
cular aperture in the hollow head of each doe is a characteris
tic of deer figures found in this region. 2

These two yoke ornaments are cast in the shape of a doe and
a stag. The stag's antlers are now missing from the sockets
between the ears. The eyes of both deer are represented by
small, almond-shaped bosses and the mouths by open slits.
The ornaments are hollow cast, with open-ended muzzles and
inside cores. Although the surface is quite worn, the remains
of tinning are still visible under the corrosion. A longitudinal
mold mark bisects the body, and a V-shaped mold mark
below the ears indicates that each deer was cast integrally with
the ears
The ornaments originally belonged to a larger set similar to
catalogue no. 32 and functioned the same way. Apparently,
such ornaments often represented both male and female deer,
exemplified by the stag and doe figures excavated at Sujigou,
Jungar banner, southwestern Inner Mongolia. 1

Like all yoke ornaments, this recumbent doe is hollow cast. A
sunken, almond-shaped mark indicates each eye, and each ear
is represented by a triangle begun by a spiral at the inside base
A socket protrudes vertically from the back and probably once
held some sort of banner or tassel. The piece has been wiped
with molten tin to give it a flashy, silvery appearance. A longi
tudinal mold mark bisects the entire figure including the socket.
Like catalogue nos. 32 and 33, the muzzle of this small
recumbent doe is open at the end, a common characteristic of
deer figures discovered in the vicinity of southern Ningxia and
southeastern Gansu. Tinning is also a surface enrichment fre
quently found on artifacts excavated in this region, and was used
to signify status before the development of mercury gilding and
the accompanying increase in the use of precious metals 1

yoke ornaments were also found in conjunction with the
remains of a wheeled vehicle at the site of Yulongtai, Jungar

Two delightful kulans (wild asses) here surmount a pair of
finials that may once have decorated a funerary cart. The over
sized ears identify the animals as kulans, which were common
to the grasslands of China's northern frontier. Each is repre
sented in the round, but with the front and back legs merged
into one. The eyes are naturalistically indicated by intaglio
areas, and the mouth of each is shown slightly open. The sock
ets are rectangular in shape and have two holes cut into each
through which an attachment pin would have been inserted.
The shiny surface of the bronze indicates that the finials were
intentionally tinned, and a longitudinal seam confirms that
each finial was piece-mold cast.
Two finials very similar to these examples were excavated
at Yulongtai, Jungar banner, in the Ordos Desert region, from
a burial site that has been dated to the fourth century B.C. and
associated with the pastoral peoples who once grazed their
herds in the area. 1 Like the Thaw finials, the Yulongtai orna
ments are also tinned and piece -mold cast.
Finials surmounted by animals were popular not only
among the nomads of southern Siberia as decoration for funer
ary canopies but also among the Scythians in northwestern
Eurasia, as decoration on two-wheeled vehicles used in funer
ary rituals. 2 Yulongtai also yielded the remains of a two
wheeled vehicle, suggesting that the Thaw finials once
belonged to a larger set that adorned the four corners of a
funerary cart. 3

sumably for attachment purposes. A longitudinal mold mark,
especially visible under the tongue, indicates piece-mold cast
ing of the head and body; the horns were cast separately and
then inserted into sockets in the head and soldered into place
Similar pole ends associated with wheeled vehicles have
been found in burials of the pastoral peoples inhabiting the
Ordos Desert region of southwestern Inner Mongolia. ' The
protruding tongue relates this pole ornament to catalogue no
3 1 , where the same gesture indicates that the animal is rep
resented in rut.

3. WEAPONS, HELMETS, AND TOOLS
In spite of their fearsome descriptions in historical literature,
the ancient peoples of the Eurasian steppes do not appear to
have possessed vast stores of life-threatening weapons com
pared with the arsenals of the settled civilizations with which
they came in contact. All of the examples in this section can
be associated with the pastoral peoples to the north of China,
but their shapes, decoration, and methods of production relate
them to weaponry traditions found throughout the steppes
rather than to traditions in China's Central Plains, as has been
suggested in the past. The short sword (duan jian in Chinese
archaeological literature and a dagger in the West) is one of
the most characteristic steppe artifacts. The blade was tradi
tionally cast integrally with its hilt (cat. no. 40), whereas in
China they were cast separately and then assembled (cat.
no. 48). 1 The short sword was primarily a small personal
weapon for thrusting and stabbing rather than a slashing, battle
ready weapon. 2 Axe heads used by pastoral groups (cat. no. 42)
all have tubular sockets, a hafting device first conceived in the
west and then introduced into the periphery of the Chinese
world via the steppes during the second millennium B.C. 3 Such
axes belonged to a broad Eurasian steppe tradition and would
have been more a prestige item than a weapon worthy of great
strength to wield.
1
. In some scholarly literature, such weapons are described as acinaces, a
Greek term used by Herodotus (4.70). An acinaces was employed by
the Saka people to stir blood in a bowl. The blood was then imbibed
as an oath was sworn to blood brotherhood. As we do not know what
an acinaces looked like, however, the term is best avoided.
2
. Although there are certain similarities between Scythian short swords
used in the West and those of the eastern Eurasian pastoral peoples,
the two types do not appear to be directly related. Rather, they may
both derive from a common Central Asian weapon tradition that has
not yet been identified. I am very grateful to P. R. S. Moorey for his
helpful comments concerning this subject.

Short sword
Northwest China, 1 3th— 1 2th century B.C.
Bronze
Length io 7/s in. (27.7 cm)
Lent by Shelby White and Leon Levy
The flattened ovoid hilt, animal's head pommel, and tapering
leaf- shaped blade that characterize this short sword were all
cast in one piece. The hilt and blade are separated by a notched
guard which has two straight blunt wings that project sideways.
The hilt is slightly curved at the end and decorated longitudi
nally with alternating plain and pebbled bands, and the blade
is distinguished by a median ridge that extends from one of
the plain bands. The use of a median ridge to strengthen the
blade can be traced back to mid- second-millennium B.C. tra
ditions at Zhukaigou, in the Ordos region of Northwest
China. 1 The pommel takes the form of a horned mythological
animal with open jaws that reveal sharp teeth.
This short sword is typical of the personal weapons and
tools used by the northern hunting and herding peoples in the
eastern Eurasian steppes during the last centuries of the sec
ond millennium b.c. 2 Short swords with similar shapes have
been found at numerous sites on China's northwestern fron
tier as well as at Anyang, the last capital of the Shang dynasty,
where they represent exotica from beyond the northern
fringes and indicate cultural contact between the Chinese and
their pastoral neighbors. 3
Short swords with oval, slightly curved hilts are earlier than
those with flat, straight hilts. The mythological animal's head that
forms the pommel is highly unusual, with no known parallel.

This handsome knife has a curved hilt terminating in a ram's
head distinguished by prominent curled horns. The junction
between the hilt and the blade is marked by a ridge and a pro
jecting tang on the cutting side. The eyes and nostrils are
punctuated by turquoise inlays, and a series of nine indented
lines marks the hilt two-thirds of the way down. A small loop
under the ram's chin serves as a suspension ring, and longitu
dinal mold marks along the edge of the hilt indicate that the knife
was piece-mold cast integrally with the blade and pommel
A knife with an ibex-head pommel and a shape similar to
that of this knife is in the Arthur M. Sackler collections. 1
Knives with zoomorphic pommels have been excavated
together with non- Chinese material throughout North China
at sites in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces. 2 A knife with
a ram's-head pommel that is stylistically related to the pres
ent knife was also reported from Tazigou, Lindong county,
Chifeng city, southeastern Inner Mongolia. 3
A knife of this type was discovered in the late -thirteenth
century B.C. tomb of Fu Hao, consort of the Shang king Wu
Ding, at Anyang, Henan Province. 4 The presence of such an
artifact in a royal Shang tomb is firm evidence of contact
between China and the northern pastoral peoples from whom
the Shang acquired wheeled transport and horse-drawn char
iots^ It is possible that Fu Hao was not herself Shang but from
one of the peripheral non- Chinese (Jang) groups with whom
the Shang interacted, a fact that would explain some of the
steppe-related artifacts in her tomb. 6

Axe head with oval-shaped blade
Northeast China, 1 oth— 8th century b.c.
Bronze
Width 3^4 in. (8.1 cm); length r in. (12.7 cm)
Ex coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
This axe head is distinguished by an oval-shaped blade and a
tubular socket. Two arrowheads and a five-pronged whorl star
mark each side. A rounded butt plate projects from the back
of the socket, and a small vertical loop is placed near its lower
rim. A mold mark visible between the blade and the socket
indicates that the axe head was cast in a two-piece mold.
A nearly identical axe head is in the Reitberg Museum,
Zurich, 1 and a similar example is in the Museum of Far
Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm, said to have been acquired in
Tianjin, northeastern Hebei Province. 2 This type of axe has
not been found in archaeological context, but the presence of
a crudely cast tiger in the round surmounting the socket of
another version 3 relates the present example stylistically to
early-first-millennium B.C. Bronze Age finds in Northeast
China, where tiger figures with similar markings frequently
occur. 4 Axe heads of this kind have traditionally been dated to
the late second millennium b.c. , but stylistic associations sug
gest a later date, which is more compatible with the date of
around the tenth century b.c. suggested by Loehr. 5
Axe heads with tubular sockets first developed in West Asia
and were then introduced into the periphery of China during
the late second millennium b.c. Axe heads with oval blades have
not been found in Siberia, but five-pointed whorls, traditionally
interpreted as solar symbols, occur on other artifacts discov
ered to the north of China, such as the gold ornaments found
at a fifth-to-fourth-century site in Tuva. 6

Knife-spoon
Northeast China, 1st half of 1st millennium B.C.
Bronze
Length 10 /gin. (26.5 cm)
Katherine and George Fan
This utensil would have been a very appropriate item for the
toolkit of a member of a hunting people living beyond the
frontiers of Northeast China, as it would have served two pur
poses. One end is a spoon with an oblong bowl, and the other
is a knife with a long, slender blade. The blade is an extension
of the hilt, with no guard or transverse element. Rounded S
shaped spirals decorate one side of the handle, and squared
76



spirals the other side. The handle was cast integrally in a piece
mold with the blade and bowl. A mold mark is visible along
the edge of the handle.
To date, the present knife-spoon appears to have no exca
vated or collected counterpart. The Arthur M. Sackler col
lections include three knife-spoons that have been attributed
to southern Siberia or Mongolia based on the presence of
arsenic in the alloys from which they were cast and that are
stylistically related to knives cast between the twelfth and the
tenth century. 1 The long slender blade, without a guard, is
related to knives associated with Northeast China dating from
the eighth to fifth century B.C., 2 and the oblong spoon bowl
occurs in tiny spoons also associated with Northeast China. 3
The S-shaped spiral embellishment is identical to the linear
decoration of a Dongbei scabbard in the present exhibition
that has been dated from the seventh to the sixth century b.c.
(cat. no. 45"), so that it would seem plausible to give this knife
spoon the same date.

Knife with bird's head
Northeast China, 8th— 6th century b.c.
Bronze
Length 6 7/s in. (17.4 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
An openwork bird's head in profile serves as the pommel for
this knife. Two recumbent does represented with sunken lines
decorate one side of the hilt, and three standing boars with
down-turned heads and bristling manes adorn the other side
Mold marks and metal flashing in the bird's head confirm that
the piece was cast in a two-piece mold.
Although no identical knife has been found in archaeolog
ical context, the drawing of the animals is consistent with
Loehr's knife typology, which would date such a piece from
the eighth to the sixth century B.C. 1 Numerous knives with
similar animal representations associated with the ancient
hunting cultures of Northeast China are included in the Arthur
M
. Sackler collections 3 The zoomorphic images on artifacts
found at sites in Northeast China are far more sensitively
drawn than those on artifacts found at sites west of the Taihang
Mountains in North China.

Short sword and sheath with animal motifs
Northeast China, 7th— 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Short sword: Length 1 1 % in. (30.2 cm)
Sheath: Length 8 Vi in. (21.6 cm)
Ex coll.: Anthony Plowright, Paris
Animal figures embellish this short sword and sheath. The
sheath carries an intaglio design of six does and six S- shaped
spirals on each side. Seven standing horses in profile, with only
two legs shown, adorn one side of the hilt. Raised spirals mark
the horses' shoulders and rumps, as they do the deer on the
sheath. The other side of the hilt is decorated with four back
to-back stags' heads with their antlers arranged vertically. The
short sword has a notched straight blade with a raised longi
tudinal ridge, a straight guard, and a perforation below the
bar at the top for attachment purposes. Both the sheath and
the sword are piece-mold cast, as indicated by mold marks
on the side edges of the sheath and on the hilt of the short
sword. The blade and hilt were integrally cast.
Short swords were not major battle weapons. Rather, they
were small personal weapons used for stabbing and cutting
that would have been useful in a pastoral society. The sheath
was suspended from the belt and tied to the thigh by two
straps attached to the two pairs of loops on the sides, a prac
tical way to carry such a weapon, whether one is on foot or on
horseback.
A short sword of the same shape with similar intaglio dec
oration on the hilt was excavated at Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia, a site that has tradi
tionally been dated from the eighth to the seventh century B.C. 1
A similar short sword in the Chaoyang City Museum is given
a Warring States date, 2 as is one in the collection of the Tokyo
National Museum, dated from the ninth to the seventh
century B.C. 3
The motif of a stag with vertically extended antlers occurs
in the Koban culture of the Caucasus in the eighth to the
seventh century, 4 on Tagar artifacts dated from the sixth
to the fifth century, 5 and again on Sauromatian objects of the
fifth century. 6 This conventionalized way of representing a
stag's antlers appears to have had priority in the west and was
then transmitted eastward. Such trans -Asian comparisons sug
gest a date no earlier than the seventh century for the Thaw
and similar examples. A date of the eighth to the seventh cen
tury for Xiaoheishigou is thus too early. A later date is also
indicated by the trans-Asian comparisons presented for cata
logue no. 46, a helmet.

Bronze

Ex coll.: Ariadne Galleries, Inc., New York
A figure of a horse in the round surmounts the top of this hel
met. Flashing in the opening between the legs and a mold
mark bisecting the body longitudinally indicate that the horse
was cast in a two-piece mold and then soldered in place. The
helmet's face opening has a small point projecting downward
over the forehead, and the border around the edge of the hel
met is embellished with a running design of triangles that
appears to have been chiseled into the surface. Two small
attachment loops are soldered onto each side near the bottom
rim. Unlike the horse, the helmet displays no mold marks,
having been cast by the lost-wax method.
A very similar helmet, also surmounted by a horse figure
and decorated with a triangle-patterned border, was exca
vated at the Bronze Age site of Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia, but whether the open
ing in front has a point over the forehead is not clear from the
published drawing. 1 A helmet of this type, surmounted by a
horse, in the David-Weill collection does not have a point, 2
but there is one on another helmet, also surmounted by a
horse, in the National Palace Museum, Taibei. 3 It would
appear that the frontal point is a feature that originated in
Russia, where it is first found on seventh-century B.C. helmets
excavated at Kelermes. 4 For this reason, helmets with this fea
ture from Northeast China cannot be dated before the sev
enth century B.C.
Earlier helmets found within China are piece-mold cast, as
indicated by mold marks along the vertical central line on
Shang-dynasty helmets from Anyang, Henan Province^ The
first archaeological evidence for lost- wax casting in China was
discovered at the sixth-century B.C. Chu state cemetery in
Xiasi, Xichuan county, Henan Province. 6 The possibility that
lost-wax casting was practiced earlier on the northeastern
periphery of China and that the northern hunting and herding
peoples played some role in its transmission from the west
warrants further consideration.

Northeast China, jth century B.C.
Bronze
Height 9V2 in. (24. 1 cm); width 7 A in. (20 cm);
depth 8 h in . (21.3 cm)
Ex coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
This helmet is nearly identical to catalogue no. 46, with the
exception of a horned animal head in relief on the front. The
animal' s-head design was most likely produced by hammering
the cast metal over a matrix. To date, this is the only known
helmet of its type that carries a repousse decoration formed by
hammering. The raised decoration on helmets found in China
was produced by piece-mold casting. 1 Helmets such as this
one and catalogue no. 46 belong not to casting traditions in
China but to those found far to the west.
The alloy from which the helmet is formed is a leaded
bronze. The remains of a coarse fabric are visible on the right
side of the helmet, indicating that it may have been wrapped
in fabric at the time of burial. It is possible that the helmet
was also lined with cloth of some type when worn.



The animal mask on the front of the helmet must have pro
vided magical protection for the wearer and was possibly a
clan marker. The presence of the mask suggests that the
wearer enjoyed a higher rank than a person whose helmet did
not display such decoration. Helmets are the earliest known
form of body armor and remain today an essential means of
protection not only in war but also in sports. They frequently
display images that transform or identify the wearer, as sug
gested here.

Short sword
North China, ca. 7th century b.c.
Blade, bronze; hilt, gold with turquoise inlay
Length 24.7 cm (9/4 in.)
Private Collection
The hilt of this short sword is cast in brilliant gold. Its double
edged blade with prominent median ridge, which tapers grad
ually to a pointed tip, retains some sharpness in spite of
corrosion. The guard is formed by a stylized animal's head
with short horns and broad jaws, and two raised parallel lines
spiral upward toward the pommel around the shaft. The
evenly spaced spikes between the lines are accented with
brightly colored turquoise inlays
Bronze short swords are commonly found among the steppe
cultures, but those with luxurious embellishment are rare. A
comparable but less lavishly decorated example, cast in one
piece in bronze, is in the Tokyo National Museum, its hilt
decorated with similar spiraling lines and spikes. 1 Among
archaeological finds, a bronze short sword found at Fengxiang,
Shaanxi Province, comes closest to the present example.
Apparently, it has the same design and the same decoration,
but the hilt is cast in bronze. 2 ZS

49Knife surmounted by a tiger
Northeast China, 7th- 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Length 1
3A in. (29.8 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
A small standing tiger in the round, its long tail touching its
hind paws, serves as the pommel for this sturdy knife. The
tiger's striped pelt is indicated by worn intaglio chevrons, and
an indented tear-shaped mark emphasizes its powerful
haunches. The eyes and nostrils are represented by round
indentations, and the hilt is decorated with bird images. One
side displays six birds of prey with outspread wings and the
other side six birds in profile, with one shown upside down.
Mold marks in the opening between the tiger's legs and along
the spine of the blade indicate that the entire knife was cast in
a two-piece mold.
Knives with similar tiger-shaped pommels and bird
decorated hilts have been excavated at Bronze Age sites in
Northeast China, such as Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng county, in
southeastern Inner Mongolia, a site with an eighth-to-seventh
century b.c. dating, here revised to the seventh-to-sixth
century B.C. 1 The bird images that adorn the hilt follow ear
lier pictorial traditions found in petroglyphs throughout Inner
Mongolia, Mongolia, and southern Siberia. 2
Knives were very common among the non- Chinese people
who inhabited the northern frontier zone east of the Taihang
Mountains, where such implements were designed as tools to be
used in hunting and skinning rather than as weapons in warfare.
1. Xiang 1984, p. 121, fig. 3:2; Shanghai 2000, p. 104. In the text, the
dates suggested are contemporary with the late Western Zhou
early Eastern Zhou period, which translates to about the eighth
century B.C. In cat. no. 45, they have been revised to the seventh to
sixth century B.C.

Knife surmounted by a tiger
Northeast China, 7th — 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Length 1 2 V% in. (30.8 cm)
Ex coll.: Susan Chen & Company, Hong Kong
A standing tiger with five-clawed paws serves as the pommel
of this knife. Its pelt is marked with indented chevrons and its
haunches accentuated by tear-shaped ovals. Each side of the
hilt is decorated with two vertical, striated sunken panels sep
arated by a plain panel and framed by the hilt's unadorned
borders. Mold marks within the opening between the tiger's
legs indicate that the knife and pommel were cast integrally in
a two-piece mold.
This knife, with its tiger-shaped pommel, belongs to the
same category as catalogue no. 49, and it too should be asso
ciated with Northeast China of the seventh to the sixth cen
tury B.C. The only difference between the two knives is the
slightly straighter blade that curves up almost imperceptibly at
the tip on the present knife. Such a tip would have prevented
a hunter from piercing the pelt when skinning an animal.

Knife with standing bear
Northeast China, 7th— 6th century b.c.
Bronze
Length 10/1 in. (26.7 cm)
Ex coll.: Susan Chen & Company, Hong Kong
The pommel of this knife is formed by a standing five-clawed
bear with a slightly open mouth and punched round eyes. Like
the tigers on catalogue nos. 49 and co, the pelt is marked by
chevrons, and indented ovals emphasize the haunches. A ver
tical panel with a striated design between two sunken plain
panels adorns the hilt, and a mold mark along the back of the
hilt indicates that the knife was cast in a two-piece mold.
There is no question that this sturdy knife and catalogue
nos. 49 and co date from the same period and were produced
by the same culture in Northeast China. The hilts of all three
knives comfortably fit the hand, as those of a tool should. The
close similarity between the three knives further suggests that
they were all cast in the same region, perhaps even at the
same foundry. Several other published knives appear to
belong to the same group. 1 The possibility that there were
regional foundries established specifically to supply the hunt
ing and herding peoples beyond the frontiers of China should
be considered.

Knife surmounted by a hedgehog
Northeast China, 7th — jth century B.C.
Bronze
Length <, % in. (13.3 cm)
Ex coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
A small hedgehog adorns the stud that projects outward from
the hilt of this knife. Shown in profile with its head down, the
hedgehog has tiny raised marks on its body to indicate the
spines. One side of the hilt has a vertical intaglio design in
sequence: three thin horizontal lines, two single birds with
outspread wings, three horizontal lines, three single birds, and
three more horizontal lines. The other side is decorated by
two standing animals . The hedgehog was probably precast and
then cast onto the knife, which displays mold marks along
the edges, the result of piece -mold casting. The knife tip has
broken off.
Hedgehogs, friendly nocturnal creatures, are represented
on numerous artifacts associated with the nomadic peoples
beyond the northern frontier of China. 1 A fmial in the Museum
of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm, depicts a hedgehog that
is very similar to this one. 2 The Thaw knife must have served
as a minor tool, as it is too small to grasp firmly with the whole
hand. Knives with a decorated stud at the end of the hilt are
found chiefly among grave goods in Northeast China dating
from the eighth to the fifth century B.C. 3
Two subspecies of hedgehog are known in China: Erinaceus
echinus deablatus has long ears and is found in Shandong, Hebei,
Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces; E.e. miodon has short ears and
inhabits the northern Shaanxi desert area. They were among
the sacred animals of Siberian shamanism and also figure
prominently in European folktales. In ancient Egypt, hedge
hops were believed to signify renewal and rebirth because they
would emerge in spring after a long winter in hibernation. 4
Hedgehogs may also have been associated with similar beliefs
in East Asia. Today, hedgehog skins are nailed over doorways
in Mongolia for protection and good luck.

Knife scabbard with birds in a row

Bronze
Length 9^2 in. (24.1 cm)
Ex coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
Nine birds in a row perch on the top edge of this curved knife
scabbard. The heads of three of the birds have broken off, but
the remaining figures are depicted in profile, with the eye
marked by a circular depression. The scabbard itself is cast in
openwork, with slanting rectangular openings that form a
chevron pattern banded by raised hemispheres on the front
and seven slanting rectangles on the back. Two squared
attachment loops project from the edge, and flashing and mold
marks indicate piece-mold casting. A raised vertical line on
the reverse of each bird must have facilitated the attachment
of the figures during the casting process.
A very similar scabbard in the David- Weill collection was
published by Salmony, 1 but no identical scabbard of this type
has been found in archaeological context. A curved scabbard
of a similar type was excavated at Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia, which suggests that the
Thaw scabbard can be attributed to Northeast China. 2 Two
other artifacts from this site are also decorated with birds in
profile not unlike those seen here. 3 By contrast, nothing sim
ilar has been found at pastoral sites in Northwest China.

guard. Jagged zigzag lines indicate the feline's toothy jaws,
and circular depressions mark the shoulders and haunches.
The blade and hilt of the sword are integrally cast, with visi
ble mold join seams running down the edges.
The piece-mold cast sheath has an openwork interlace
design accented by circular turquoise inlays that may once
have been backed with colored leather or fabric. The casting
process has been described by Pieter Meyers, conservator at
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art: "Make decorated
model; take mold impressions and make molds; add circular
decoration in molds; cut down model so that it can be used as
core; assemble and cast. Alloy compositions are very similar
for both short sword and sheath: leaded tin-copper alloy
(leaded bronze)."
No identical short sword and sheath have been found in
archaeological context, but in shape and style they are
related to artifacts associated with northern Hebei Province
and Northeast China, where zigzag lines indicating a feline's
mouth and indented marks on the shoulders and haunches are
characteristic artistic motifs. The interlace designs on the
guard and scabbard derive from the dragon-inspired interlace
patterns seen on early-sixth- century B.C. Chinese bronze rit
ual vessels. 1 A close examination of the scabbard reveals ves
tigial indented circular eyes that remain from the earlier
dragon design. Such a stylistic relationship with Chinese
bronze decoration suggests a sixth-century date for both the
short sword and the scabbard.
The rounded median ridge, which serves to strengthen the
blade, is an imported feature that became extremely common
on short swords produced in North China during tbe Spring
and Autumn period. 2 Because the ridge occurs earlier, on a
89



short sword from the second-millennium b.c. site of
Zhukaigou, in the Ordos region, its presence on late Spring
and Autumn blades testifies to extensive contact between the
Chinese and their northern neighbors. 3 As a type, the scab
bard also appears to have originated in the north. 4 The unusual
combination of Chinese and non- Chinese northern features
on both the short sword and the scabbard suggests that they
may have been manufactured by Chinese artisans for north
ern, non- Chinese consumption.

Knife with zoomorphic decoration
East-Central Asia, 6th century b.c.
Bronze
Length 8 Vi in. (2 1 .6 cm)
Ex coll.: Susan Chen & Company, Hong Kong
Three felines—perhaps panthers—in the round, their paws
transformed into stylized raptors' heads, adorn the hilt of this
elegant knife. The paws appear to terminate in such a way that
the ring formed by the claws serves as the circular eye of each
raptor. The felines' eyes are described by a round depression.
A mold seam along the edges of the hilt suggests that the knife
was cast in a two-piece mold.
No other knife with a similar zoomorphic hilt has been
identified in the archaeological literature, but the representa
tion of the claws as raptors' heads is a well-known instance of
zoomorphic juncture that occurs in Scythian art of the Black
Sea region, as in the case of a seventh-century b.c. gold pan
ther from Kelermes, whose claws are transformed into tiny
coiled panthers. 1 A similar example of feline claws metamor
phosed into raptors' heads occurs on several artifacts from the
Tuva region in southern Siberia. 2 Knives are not typical
Scythian tools and are more common among the nomadic
peoples of the eastern Eurasian steppe world.

Short sword withfour kulans
North China and south-central Inner Mongolia,
6th^£th century B.C.
Bronze
Length 9% in. (24. r cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This handsome short sword has an openwork hilt featuring
the heads of four kulans depicted in the round. The hilt is sur
mounted by a flat, oval pommel decorated with an angular
blind strap-work design that also marks the rounded V-shaped
guard. The double-edged blade tapers to a point and displays
a pronounced median ridge. The nicks along the side of the
blade are the result of wear, and the transverse perforation
through the pommel allows the piece to be suspended.
Longitudinal mold lines along the edge of the hilt indicate that
the short sword was piece-mold cast.
No short swords of this type have been excavated archae
ologically, but there are short swords with similar openwork
hilts in several collections.' An identical example is in the
Hellstrom collection in Goteborg. 2 Typologically, the pres
ent short sword relates to catalogue no. C4.
It is interesting to note that the hilt of a short sword exca
vated from kurgan 1 , Filippovka, in the southern Urals, has a
similar openwork hilt featuring raptors' heads dating from the
fifth to the fourth century b.c. 3 This similarity between a short
sword traditionally associated with North China and a weapon
from the southern Urals suggests that the two may have a
common heritage in the earlier Iron Age of Central Asia that
has yet to be identified.

Short sword with birds' heads
North China and south-central Inner Mongolia,
6th— 5th century B.C.
Bronze
Length in. (24.8 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
The pommel and guard of this short sword are formed by two
stylized outward-facing birds' heads represented in intaglio.
The hilt is flat and enhanced by three sunken claws resembling
those of an eagle, the most powerful raptor in the Eurasian
steppes. The tapering double-edged blade is strengthened
by a strong median ridge, and the concave channels along
either side would have helped to increase the flow of blood
when the weapon pierced the flesh. A circular perforation for
attachment is located on the hilt below the pommel, and mold
marks within the perforation indicate that the sword was cast
in a two-piece mold.
No exact counterpart to this example has been archaeo
logically excavated, but similar weapons with a variety of
bird's-head pommels and guards are associated with the pas
toral peoples west of the Taihang Mountains, in North China
and south-central Inner Mongolia, around the middle of the
first millennium B.C. 1 Such short swords, with bird's-head
decoration and dating from the sixth to the fifth century B.C.
have been found at Maoqinggou, Liangcheng county, on the
southern slopes of the Manhan Mountains. 2

Knife with recumbent horse

Bronze
Length 8 in. (20.3 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
A recumbent horse at the hilt of this elegant knife is shown
in profile, with a perforated eye and folded legs. The blade is
curved, with a tip that turns up slightly, a single edge, and two
angular bends along the crest. Decorated longitudinally, the
hilt has two parallel lines of raised bosses between two ridged
edges. A seam visible under the horse's belly and under the
neck indicates that the knife was cast integrally with the hilt in
a two-piece mold.
Nothing similar has been found archaeologically, but there
is a nearly identical example in the Katherine and George Fan
collection that is said to come from the Ningcheng region of
southeastern Inner Mongolia and Northeast China. Horse
figures appear to have been quite popular among the frontier
peoples in Northeast China, and they adorn numerous arti
facts associated with that region. The present knife was prob
ably not a weapon but a tool of some sort useful to hunters and
horse people.



4. BELT ORNAMENTS
Belt ornaments are the most distinctive artifacts associated
with the Eurasian steppe peoples. Belts were not just a practi
cal means of holding up and fastening items of clothing. To the
pastoral peoples of northern Eurasia, belt ornaments were nec
essary regalia, which they adorned with visual symbols that
identified the owner's clan, rank, and prestige. By contrast, the
belt hooks worn by the Chinese indicated power and wealth,
but never clan and rank. The source for detached metal belt
plaques strung on some sort of perishable material is somewhat
obscure, but belts embellished by metal date back to the third
millennium B.C. in the ancient Near East. Belts ornamented
with a series of metal plaques first occurred in the Caucasus
early in the first millennium B.C.' The earliest excavated evi
dence for this type of belt ornament in East Asia occurs around
the seventh century B.C. in a nomadic burial at Zhoujiadi,
Aohan banner, southeastern Inner Mongolia2 and slightly later
in the Guo state cemetery at Shangcunling, Henan Province. 3 A
belt decorated with metal plaques became an important pres
tige item among successive nomadic groups, such as the Avars,
Turks, Kitan, and Mongols, throughout the first and second
millennia a.d. The decorated belt was also introduced into
Europe during the Migration (ca. a.d. 400 -800) and medieval
periods, when it came to represent military prowess, honor,
and all the heroic virtues associated with chivalry.
1 . Moorey 1967, pp. 83 — 85. Belts adorned with metal sheets can be
traced back to the third-millennium B.C. burials at Ur, in the ancient
Near East, where they are found in burials with small personal
weapons suspended from them.

Hook buckle in the shape of three raptors' heads
North China and south-central Inner Mongolia,
6th— ^th century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 1% in. (4.8 cm); width 2 7/s in. (7.3 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
This hook buckle is cast in the shape of three raptors' heads.
The two smaller heads have long curved beaks and are repre
sented on the larger section (the wearer's right), from which
projects an attachment hook. The beaks are each marked by a
row of five pseudogranulated dots within a sunken area. A
larger bird's head with a curled beak, nearly identical in design
to catalogue no. 140, forms a side extension that carries a ver
tical attachment loop on the reverse. The buckle was cast inte
grally with the loop in a multipiece mold, and the silvery
appearance of the surface indicates that it was intentionally
tinned on both sides 1
No hook buckle identical to this one has been excavated
archaeologically, but a nearly identical example was recov
ered with scrap metal by workers in a Beijing factory, 2 and
94



another example is in the collection of the Museum of Far
Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm. 3

Ex coll. : Four Corporation, New York; Mathias Komor
This Thracian belt buckle is cast in the shape of a crouching
wolf. The back is flat and displays a horizontal hook behind
the head pointing toward the tail, where a tiny loop remains;
the rest of the fastening device is missing. The buckle is lost
wax cast.
A nearly identical buckle in the shape of a wolf was exca
vated in Apollonia, Bulgaria. 1 In antiquity, a neophyte Thracian
warrior was often awarded a belt as a sign of his having reached
maturity and completed the initiation into manhood. 2

Hook buckle with heads of a bird and a deer
North China, 6th— 4th century b.c.
Bronze
Length 2 in. (j cm)
Katherine and George Fan
This small buckle has a circular center section with a hook in
the shape of a bird's head on one side and an attachment loop
at the other end in the shape of a deer's head seen frontally;
the loop is formed by a strut connecting the two ears. Ribbing
marks the sides of the buckle, which display mold marks indi
cating that it was cast in a multipiece mold.
This type of simple buckle is found among pastoral peo
ples throughout the Eurasian steppes during the early part of
the first millennium B.C. as well as in ancient Iran. 1 They also
occur in China with horse gear and chariot fittings in the sixth to
the fifth century B.C. 2 and as belt accessories in the northern
95



pastoral world during the same period. 3 A similar belt buckle
in bone and with a fixed tongue was found at Zhoujiadi, an
eighth-to-seventh-century b.c. site in Aohan banner, south
eastern Inner Mongolia, suggesting that the type occurs ear
lier in the Dongbei than in Central China. 4

Belt buckle with writhing bodies
Northwest China, cth— 4th century b.c.
Tinned bronze
Height 1 h in. (3.9 cm); width 2 /s in. (7.3 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
Published: So and Bunker 1995, p. 135, no. 53; Takahama and
Hatakeyama 1997, no. 192.
This pentagonal buckle is embellished with writhing bodies
enclosed within a narrow border of scalelike motifs. A large
dragon mask with typically Chinese heart-shaped ears and
rolled-up muzzle fills the blunt end . Behind the mask the body
splits in two, each part bordered by two pebbled strips, with
one fore- and one hind leg emerging from spiral haunches.
Between the haunches and facing the buckle opening is a
smaller, bovine mask. Two diminutive animals, also rendered
with pebbled bodies, fill the space on either side. On the bor
der of the squarish opening is a fixed projection for fastening;
a stemmed stud on the underside, near the blunt end, is also
part of the fastening device. There is considerable wear
around the button and the opening. The buckle was cast by the
lost- wax process, and the silvery sheen on the surface is the
result of tinning. The marks left by fingers pushing the wax
into the mold to make the casting model are visibly impressed
in the metal on the reverse.
In form and decoration, this buckle exemplifies a blend of
Chinese and northern steppe traditions. The buckle with a sta
tionary hook is a northern feature, and the serpentine
zoomorphic motif prevails on Chinese ritual vessels of the fifth
century b.c. 1 Buckles similar in shape and decoration are
included in many collections 2 and have been discovered in
non-Chinese graves in Zhongwei county, Ningxia, 3 and in the
Qingyang region of southeastern Gansu Province. 4 They were
probably made expressly for trade with the neighboring pas
toral peoples in a Qin metalworking center somewhere in
Shaanxi Province.

Sixteen belt ornaments
Northwest China, 4th century B.C.
Tinned bronze
a. Height 2 in. (c. 1 cm); width ^Vs in. (7.9 cm)
b — p. Height 1 % in. (2.9 cm); width 2 in. (c.i cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This partial set of sixteen belt ornaments consists of one
buckle plaque and fifteen smaller plaques. The large plaque,
in the shape of a fantastic standing wolf mauling a fallen deer,
is the wearer's right-hand half of a mirror-image pair of
plaques that together would have formed a complete belt
buckle. The ear is a heart shape, and the tail and crest each
terminate in an eared raptor's head. Beneath the wolf are
three scalloped elements, the vestigial remains of a represen
tation of a pup, such as the one shown beneath the carnivore
in catalogue no. 94. The deer is shown lying with a twisted
body, its muzzle in the wolf's open jaws. The reverse displays
a vertical loop behind the wolf's haunches and the remains of
96



another loop behind the head. The plaque was cast by the lost
wax process and then intentionally tinned on one side to give
it a pleasing, lustrous surface.
Each of the fifteen small belt plaques takes the form of two
tangent coiled raptors joined by a boss. The raptors are shown
in profile, with a curvy wing and tail distinguished by longitu
dinal ridges. Each plaque once had a vertical loop, now mostly
missing, on the reverse behind the boss. Like the buckle
plaque, their surfaces have been tinned, a bronze enrichment
that may have indicated that the owner had a higher status than
someone who wore only plain bronze belt ornaments.
The large buckle plaque displays an animal-combat scene
very similar to that of plaque catalogue no. 94. The raptors on
the smaller plaques have been reduced to conventionalized
designs that can ultimately be traced back to bird images found
on Western Zhou ritual vessels. 1 Even those with ears, as
shown here, can be found in the Western Zhou bronze vocab
ulary. 2 Such raptors have been inaccurately described as
griffins. These raptors have round eyes, while those on the
mythological griffin are almond shaped 3
This belt set exhibits both northern and Chinese features.
Similar belt ornaments have been recovered from the Qingyang
region of southeastern Gansu Province and the adjacent
Guyuan region of southern Ningxia, where they must have
been worn by the herding peoples who inhabited the area dur
ing the late fourth century B.C. 4 In all probability, they were
made by Qin craftsmen specifically for these peoples. How
many plaques originally constituted a complete belt set is
unknown, since to date no complete sets that are similar have
been found intact.

Bronze
Each: Height 2 h in. (6.4 cm); width j^h in. (11.7 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
The two openwork mirror-image plaques that together form
this complete belt buckle are each cast in the shape of a walk
ing tiger. The fastening hook protrudes from the front right
hand edge of the wearer's left-hand plaque. The face of each
tiger is shown frontally and its body in profile. The paws have
three prominent sharp claws, and the pelt is distinguished by
raised striated lines . A leafy bush beneath each head lends the
scene a wooded ambience. The alloy is an arsenical copper
with traces of iron and antimony but no tin or lead, suggest
ing that the plaques were cast in southern Siberia.
The striated treatment of the tigers' pelts is stylistically
related to the tigers on the wooden coffin from tomb 2 at
Bashadar, in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia, dating
from the sixth to the fifth century B.C. (fig. 32). The plaques
also foreshadow slightly later tiger plaques, such as catalogue
no. 97 and those found at sites in Guyuan county, Ningxia.'
The leafy bush is related to the vegetation represented on cat
alogue nos. 7 8 and 80, which were also cast somewhere north
of the Chinese frontier regions.

This complete belt buckle comprises two bovine-shaped, mir
ror-image plaques. Each bovine is shown with its head turned
downward and slightly back toward the rump. The facial fea
tures are represented naturalistically, and the body of each is
marked by ridges and curved surface designs similar to those
seen on the carved bone cylinder, catalogue no. 1 C9. The
reverse of each plaque displays two squared vertical loops that
were probably soldered on. The plaques were cast by lost wax
and then mercury gilded. There is evidence of post-cast tool
ing to sharpen the details before gilding.
Similar plaques have been found all over North China and
are in several collections. 1 One pair was collected in Shouzhou,
Anhui Province, the capital of the state of Chu from 241 until
223 B.C., when it was conquered by the Qin. 2 Apparently, it
was a city of some sophistication, with important bronze
foundries. Another pair was excavated in Suide county, north
ern Shaanxi Province, from a Western Han tomb. 3 All these
plaques exhibit minor differences, as they were probably
products of different workshops. If they were commis
sioned by northern pastoral peoples, the designs would have
98



remained basically consistent, with only technical details vary

b. Height t%'m.. (4.1 cm); width 2V4 in. (5.7 cm)
Provenance: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This belt buckle is cast in the form of two openwork mirror
image plaques, each of which depicts a standing ox with its
body in profile within a rope-patterned frame. Each ox is
shown with all four legs, its head in three-quarter view, and
its tail curving between its legs. The wearer's left-hand plaque
has a projecting semicircular ring that is part of the fastening
device and a rounded vertical loop on the reverse. The plaque
on the left has two rounded, vertical loops. Both plaques were
cast by the lost- wax process and mercury gilded.
Plaques like these are found in both North China and Inner
Mongolia, 1 and there are other examples in many collections. 2
One was excavated at Daodunzi, Tongxin county, Ningxia, 3
and another from a tomb in Chengdu, Sichuan. The Chengdu
buckle was buried with coins that date the tomb to the late

Belt buckle with zoomorphic design
North China, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Each: Height 1 /+ in. (4.4 cm); width 3 Vi in. (9 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
The surface of these two gilded bronze belt plaques is deco
rated with a complex design of zoomorphic forms in mirror
image. The central animal is a recumbent wolf shown in
profile, with pointed ear, almond-shaped eye, turned-up
snout, open jaws revealing fangs and teeth, and two paws,
each with five claws. Two wild sheep, coiled and with their
hindquarters slung over their heads, are superimposed on the
wolf's body. Above the wolf is a row of horned gazelles'
heads, above which is a series of eared raptors' heads. The
front of each plaque has been mercury gilded, and the back
displays two vertical rounded attachment loops that have been
soldered on. A woven pattern on the reverse indicates that
the plaque was cast by the lost- wax and lost-textile process. 1
A nearly identical plaque was found among the grave
goods from Xichagou, Xifeng county, northeastern Liaoning
Province, 2 and a buckle similar to the Thaw buckle but cast in
solid gold was found in an elite Western Han burial in Jiangsu
Province, evidence for contact between the Chinese and the
northern nomads. 3 The animal-combat scene, so dramatically
portrayed on earlier nomadic plaques, such as catalogue no.
94, has been reduced here to a pleasing design that is almost
impossible to decipher at first glance. The eared raptors' heads
refer to antlers with raptors' -head tines found on earlier
plaques, but only someone initiated in this iconography would
recognize them; the symbolic content has been overwhelmed
by a stylized design of curves and countercurves . The pres
ence of mercury gilding and the emphasis on pattern are typ
ical of Western Han workmanship and confirm manufacture
by the Chinese specifically for their northern neighbors.

Belt buckle with animal-combat scene
North China, 3rd— 2nd century b.c.
Gilded bronze
Each: Height iVn in. (j.7 cm); width 4^8 in. (1 1 .7 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
This complete belt buckle consists of two mirror-image
plaques, each one showing a complex animal-combat motif in
which a bear and a wolf attack a fallen mythological ungulate
The ungulate's hindquarters are twisted 1 80 degrees, and its
antler tines terminate in raptors' heads that make up the bor
der along the top and inside edge. The back of each plaque
displays a woven pattern that indicates that it was cast by the
lost- wax and lost- textile process. The pierced hole in the
w
r earer's left-hand plaque shows that it was punched through
the cloth-backed wax model from the front. One plaque dis
plays on the reverse two vertical attachment loops that were
formed on the model by laying a wax slab on two wax posts
and then integrally casting them with the plaque. The loops on
the other plaque are broken off, and the front of each is mer
cury gilded.
Another pair of plaques with the same motif was excavated
from a Han antiquarian's tomb near Sandiancun, in the east
ern suburbs of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, where the capital
was located during the Western Han dynasty. 1 And an iden
tical right-hand plaque was excavated from a Hun burial at
Pokrovka, Kazakhstan, in the southern Urals. 2 Such a discov
ery, so far from North China, where it originated, suggests
that the Pokrovka plaque must have been a treasured heir
loom, acquired by trade or warfare, and demonstrates how
small objects transported great distances could aid in the trans
mission of styles and motifs.
This particular animal-combat scene belongs to the iconog
raphy introduced into the frontier regions of Northwest China
from the Eurasian steppes during the late fourth century b.c.
and represented on belt ornaments during the third and sec
ond centuries B.C., until the Rouzhi confederacy was driven
west by the Xiongnu in the second century B.C. 3 The vigor of
the attack scene has been thoroughly Sinicized and almost lost
in the manipulation of shapes into pleasing patterns, as in the
scene on catalogue no. 67.
Exactly where these plaques were made is hard to deter
mine, since two pairs that are identical but in gold were exca
vated from an imperial Chu tomb, wi, at Shizishan near
Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. 4 The tomb contained the remains
of Prince Liu Wu, who died in 1^4 B.C. The gold buckles
were mounted on silk belts and erroneously attributed to
Scythian workmanship from Siberia. Clearly, belt plaques
carrying this scene were made in North China, but precisely
where is unknown. Whether the Shizishan gold plaques were
acquired from the northern herding peoples or, instead, were
made in China and reflect a taste for northern exotica among
the local Han elite is also unclear. Another bronze buckle that
carries the same zoomorphic motif, in the Miho Museum,
Shigaraki, was undoubtedly made by Chinese artisans, as it is
inlaid with thin gold and silver wire, a technique not used by
metalsmiths of the eastern Eurasian steppes. s

Belt buckle with kulans attacked by wolves
Southern Siberia, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Height 3 Kin. (8.3 cm); width rXin. (14.6 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Each of these openwork plaques portrays two kulans being
attacked by two wolves as they sink their fangs into the kulans'
necks. The entire scene is enclosed within a rectangular frame
embellished by vines with tear-shaped leaves. The kulans can
be identified by their upright manes and fringed tails, and the
wolves by their bushy tails. The wearer's left-hand plaque
bears a hook on its front right edge . The alloy is an arsenical
copper with no tin or lead, a characteristic more compatible
with the alloys used in eastern and southern Siberia than in
North China's frontier regions. 1 The reverse of each plaque is
slightly concave, and the presence of flashing in the openings
suggests that the plaques were lost-wax cast from a wax model
formed in a two-piece mold. The backs are heavily encrusted
and retain fragments of textile with which they were wrapped
or to which they were attached.
No plaques with this design have been excavated archaeo
logically, but rectangular plaques with frames decorated with
leafy vines and similar tear- shaped cells, such as catalogue no.
1 or, have been found in eastern and southern Siberia. 5

Belt buckle with raptors and tigers
Southern Siberia, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Height 3 in. (7.6 cm); width c in. (12.9 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Two mythological raptors attack two tiger protomes joined
at the shoulder in this openwork belt-buckle plaque. The rap
tor — here, a fantastic creature — is distinguished from the
eagle, on which it is based, by its almond-shaped eye. The
reverse has two tiny fabric fragments on the lower left. A
hook protrudes from the left, and the right side has a hori
zontal bar in the design. It appears to have been cast by the
lost- wax process, probably from a wax model made in a two
piece mold.
Stylistically, the buckle relates to the mirror-image hori
zontal-B plaques manufactured during the Western Han
period that depict a mythological raptor attacking an entire
tiger. 1 One such plaque wras excavated at Xichagou, Xifeng
county, Liaoning Province, 2 and a pair of plaques was discov
ered near Chifeng, southeastern Inner Mongolia. 3 Another
example was found at Urbium, southern Siberia. 4
The alloy is an arsenical copper with small amounts of tin
and lead, suggesting that the plaque was cast in southern
Siberia, where such plaques with arsenical copper alloys are
confirmed both archaeologically and scientifically^

Wolf-shaped belt buckle
Southern or eastern Siberia, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Height 3
lA in. (8 . 3 cm); width 4V2 in. (11 .4 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This openwork belt buckle takes the form of a mythological
walking wolf in profile. All four legs are represented, and the
tail, crestlike mane, and antler tines terminate in eared rap
tors' heads that create a half frame around the central figure.
The reverse is concave and displays two vertical loops, one
behind the head and the other behind the haunch. On the
front, a hook projects from the left edge. The metal is a leaded
tin-copper alloy with traces of iron and antimony. There is
extensive corrosion with massive crystals of cuprite and con
siderable intergranular corrosion. The rather clean appear
ance of the buckle is the result of a recent mechanical cleaning.
The wolf is conceived in a planar style, as if the model had
been carved in wood. The buckle was cast from a mold-made
wax model.
An identically shaped buckle, which appears to have
been imported, was excavated at Xichagou, Xifeng county,



Liaoning Province. 1 A plaque depicting the same mytho
logical wolf was collected in the destroyed cemetery at
Dadaosanjiazi, near Qiqihar city, Heilongjiang Province, 2 and
a similar plaque was excavated in Dyrestuy, Transbaikal,
Buryatia, where it was found at the waist of the dead. 3 A third
was collected at Maryasova, in the Minusinsk region of south
ern Siberia. 4 Because these plaques appear to be exotic at sites
in North China, it is reasonable to suggest that they were man
ufactured in eastern or southern Siberia and represent the
style of a yet unidentified group.

Belt buckle with animal-combat scene
North China, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Height 3 V4 in. (8.3 cm); width 4 % in. (12. 1 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Published: Christie's, New York, sale cat., March 2j, 1998.
A mythological scene of animal combat is represented on this
pair of mirror-image belt plaques. On each plaque, a small
carnivore bites the leg of a fantastic ungulate, each of which
has a rapacious beak and raptor's-head antler tines and tail tip.
The wearer ' s left-hand plaque has a small hook that protrudes
from the front alongside a vertical slit near the ungulate's head.
A nearly identical single plaque was recovered from a dis
turbed cemetery at Xichagou, Xifeng county, northern
Liaoning Province. 1 The cemetery can be dated numismati
cally to the second century b.c. Xiongnu may be buried in
some of the graves; Donghu, whom the Xiongnu conquered
early in the second century B.C. , appear to be buried in others.
The ungulate with raptor's-head appendages belongs to the
same iconography that governs the tattoos found on the
104



Mongoloid man buried in kurgan 2 at Pazyryk, which dates from
the fourth to the third century B.C. (fig. 3 7). 2 The same type
of fantastic creature adorns the remains of a headdress found
at Nalin'gaotu, Shenmu county, northern Shaanxi Province
(fig. 36). This iconography has been associated with the nomads
who appeared on China's northwestern frontier in the late
fourth century B.C. and who introduced mounted warfare.
The horizontal-B motif and animal-combat scene on these
plaques are nearly identical to those on a gold plaque col
lected near Verkhneudinsk, present-day Ulan-Ude, near
Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, with one exception (fig. 48).
The Verkhneudinsk example has several animal figures super
imposed on its body that do not appear on any of the bronze
examples. Nevertheless, the similarities suggest a strong con
nection between the Verkhneudinsk gold plaque and its
bronze counterparts from Xichagou, which calls into question
the unsubstantiated date of fifth to fourth century B.C. given
to the V erkhneudinsk gold plaque in the recent Metropolitan
Museum publication The Golden Deer of Eurasia, 3

Belt buckle with wolf and ram
North China, 3rd - 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Each: Height 1 % in. (4.8 cm); width 3% in. (9.8 cm)
These mirror -image openwork plaques, each of which depicts
a wolf mauling a fallen ram, form a complete belt buckle. The
ram's hindquarters are twisted 180 degrees, and its forelegs
are placed on either side of the wolf's body. The wolf stands
behind the ram and sinks its teeth into the shoulder, and the
ram's imminent death is dramatically emphasized by its
twisted body and lolling tongue. A single rope frame borders
each plaque, giving it a slightly scalloped edge. The reverse of
each displays two vertical squared loops that were formed by
placing a strip of wax on two wax posts before casting. A
woven pattern, characteristic of the lost- wax and lost-textile
casting process, is visible on the back. Both plaques are mer
cury gilded.
The buckle is related stylistically to catalogue no. 103, but
the carnivore portrayed in that example is a feline rather than
a wolf. The wolf's position, half behind the ram, is an attack
pose found on slightly earlier plaques that also have single rope
borders, 1 and the lolling tongue is a characteristic of victims
that occurs on other third- century B.C. objects, such as cata
logue no. 1 24.

found at a slightly later site of Daodunzi, where they appear to predate
the other plaques; see Bunker ct al. 1997, p. 84, fig. ai 24.

Two felines whose hindquarters are rotated 1 80 degrees sink
their teeth into the necks of two recumbent ibex, each with its
head turned backward, on this animal-combat scene in relief
that adorns the surface of this handsome gold buckle. The ani
mals have been cleverly represented in such a way that they
conform to the shape of the buckle, one of the hallmarks of
steppe art. A hook for fastening purposes projects from the
front of the buckle near the oval opening, and a loop on the
reverse extends from the felines' tails at the opposite end.
The reverse of the plaque displays a prominent woven pat
tern, which indicates that it was cast by lost wax and lost tex
tile, in which the wax model was backed with a piece of coarse
fabric during the casting process. The wax backing served to
stabilize the model when it was extracted from the mold,
allowing for a thinner finished product and thereby reduc
ing the amount of gold used. 1 This unusual casting process
was also used to cast many of the gold belt plaques in the
Siberian collection of Peter the Great in the State Hermitage,
St. Petersburg. 2
When this buckle was donated to the Metropolitan Museum
in 1 9 1 7 , little was known about the culture of the pastoral
peoples on China's northern frontiers. It was not until 1980,
when a bronze buckle of the same shape, discovered in a
Xiongnu grave at Xigoupan, Jungar banner, in the Ordos
Desert in southwestern Inner Mongolia, was published that a
cultural context could be established. 3 The Xiongnu grave
dates to the third century b.c. , a time when the Xiongnu were
in control of the Ordos region.

Published: Borovka i960, pi. 70B; Bunker etal., 1970,
no. 1 14; Jacobson 1984, pi. 22; Bunker 1989, p. $8, fig. 9.
This buckle consists of two mirror-image plaques, each of
which depicts an animal- combat scene in which a wolf and a
tiger savage a fallen ungulate with raptor-headed appendages.
It is essentially the same scene as that depicted on the gilded
bronze plaques that make up another, earlier, buckle in the
Thaw collection, catalogue no. 68. Each of the plaques has
vertical attachment loops on the reverse, and the wearer's
left-hand plaque also has a circular perforation that is part of
the fastening system. The plaques are cast from a wax model
formed in a mold.
These belt plaques are cast in a purely Western Han style
that has transformed a fierce combat scene into a pleasing
rhythmical design of curves and linear patterns. The animals
depicted on the earlier plaques have been subtly altered, so
that the ungulate now has a muzzle instead of a beak, prompt
ing some scholars to call it a horse, in spite of the fact that the
hooves are cloven. 1 The backs of both catalogue no. 68 and
the present plaques display minor differences, indicating that
106



they were cast in slightly different ways. An extensive exam
ination of many plaques cast during the third through the first
century B.C. reveals that the plain bronze plaques were nearly
always cast by a different process than those examples that were
gilded, suggesting the existence of separate workshops — one
for casting plain bronze ornaments and another for casting
those to be mercury gilded. Whether such workshops were in
the same metalworking center or in different cities has not
been determined.

Belt buckle with beaked ungulates

Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
Published: Rawson and Bunker 1990, no. 225.
Two addorsed beaked ungulates whose hindquarters are
rotated 1 8 o degrees and whose tails terminate in eared rap
tors' heads are depicted on each of these two rectangular
plaques, which together form one complete belt buckle.
Striated enclosures mark the bodies and lend them texture.
A simulated rope border serves as a frame for each plaque.
The back of each has two vertical loops. Both plaques have
been cast by the lost-wax and lost-textile method and then
1 07



mercury gilded. The perforation in the wearer's left-hand
plaque is part of the fastening device and was punched through
the wax model from the front.
These mythological creatures derive from the glorious
ungulate that surmounts the Nalin'gaotu headdress (fig. 36),
but the earlier exuberance has been sacrificed to the demands
of a design that deliberately orchestrates curves and striated
markings. Plaques with this design have been excavated at
Xichagou, Xifeng county, Liaoning Province, 1 and at Daodunzi,
Tongxin county, Ningxia, 2 and they are included in many col
lections around the world, 3 suggesting that they were mass
produced for northern consumption.

Belt buckle with recumbent stags
North China, 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Each: Height 1 \ in. (4.8 cm); width 4 in. (10 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This belt buckle takes the form of two rectangular openwork
plaques, each of which depicts a recumbent stag with its head
turned back toward the hind legs and the antlers extended
gracefully over its body. A rope pattern serves as the border
for each plaque. The reverse of each displays two loops and
108
the characteristic lost- wax and lost- textile woven pattern. The
pattern on the reverse of one of the plaques must reflect the
rumpled state of the textile that served as backing for the wax
model during the casting process. The mercury gilding has
worn off in places.
No identical plaques are known. The style and rope bor
ders are comparable to features on other belt plaques dated to
the second century B.C. Nevertheless, there is a naturalism in
the portrayal of the stags that suggests Han Chinese charac
teristics rather than the zoomorphic symbolism associated
with the northern pastoral peoples
78.
Belt buckle with raptor attacking a goat
Mongolia or Siberia, 2nd century b.c.
Bronze
Height 2 % in. ( c.7 cm); width 3 % in. (9.8 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
Each of these mirror-image plaques depicts a scene in which
a mountain goat is attacked by a large raptor. The raptor is
represented in profile with both wings shown, sinking its beak
into the goat's neck while grasping its head with its claws. The
goat is male, as indicated by its beard, and is shown in profile,
with all four legs represented. A small leafy tree provides a
wooded setting. The wearer's left-hand plaque carries a slit
and a hook by which to fasten the buckle. The plaques were
cast from an alloy of tin and arsenic copper, with a small
amount of lead. The presence of arsenic suggests that the
buckle may have been cast far north of the Chinese frontier,



like catalogue no. 80. The plaques are lost- wax cast, probably
from a wax model formed in a two-piece mold.
Plaques of the same design have been chance finds, but
none have been excavated archaeologically. 1 The manner in
which the leaves are represented relates the present plaques
stylistically to others found in Mongolia and Siberia. 2

Gilded bronze
Each: Height it's in. (4.8 cm); width 4 in. (10.2 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Each of these two rectangular openwork belt plaques, which
together form one belt buckle, represents two Bactrian camels
flanking an Asian elm tree. The camels are shown in profile
with naturalistic detail, and the design is framed with a border
that imitates braided rope. Each plaque displays two vertical
loops on the reverse. The plaques were cast by the lost-wax
and lost-textile method from wax models that were made in
a mold and backed with a piece of coarse textile and then
mercury gilded.
109



Compositions showing Bactrian camels were very popular
among the Xiongnu, who bred and raised camels along with
cattle, sheep, and horses. 1 Several versions of these plaques
have been excavated at burial sites at Xichagou, Xifeng
county, Liaoning Province, 2 and at Daodunzi, Tongxin
county, Ningxia, 3 sites that have been dated numismatically to
the second century B.C. and associated with the Xiongnu.
The openwork design of a similar but later camel-deco
rated plaque in the Arthur M . Sackler collections is backed by
a piece of soft wood, 4 and several openwork plaques exca
vated in Buryatia also had backing of some type. s Such a back
ing for an openwork plaque seems contradictory, unless one
considers the possibility that the ends of a belt made of
brightly colored fabric were inserted between the plaque and
the backing to produce a colorful design that would imitate
appliqued felt or gold inlaid with semiprecious stones, both of
which were popular among the northern pastoral neighbors of
the Han Chinese.

Belt buckle with a lynx attaching an argali

Bronze
Each: Height 3 in. (7.6 cm); width4/4in. (10.8 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York; Michael and
Henrietta Spink, London
This belt buckle consists of two identical plaques, each of
which depicts a lynx about to pounce on an argali. The lynx
is shown frontally, amid tree branches, with only its head and
four paws shown. The alloy contains a substantial amount of
arsenic, typical of plaques made in eastern and southern
Siberia. 1 The plaques are slightly concave on the reverse and
were cast by the lost- wax process, probably from a model
formed in a two-piece mold.
A plaque that bears the same design as this one was found
in grave 1 2 8 in a Xiongnu burial ground at Dyrestuy, in the
southwestern Transbaikal region, 1 24 miles from Ulan-Ude. 2
According to the excavation report, it was found fastened to
a disintegrated piece of wood at the waist of the dead. This
further confirms the suggestion that such openwork plaques
were originally backed by fabric secured by a piece of wood.
(See also cat. no. 79.)



ue fragments similar in design to the Thaw and
Dyrestuy examples were also found in southern Siberia in the
Minusinsk region. The alloys of these bronze fragments also
contain arsenic. 3
The style in which the tree's leaves are rendered on these
plaques is the same as that of the tree leaves represented on a
plaque fragment discovered in the Gobi Desert by a joint
Mongolian— Hungarian expedition, further confirming a
northern origin for such plaques in Mongolia, Buryatia, or the
Minusinsk region rather than in North China. 4

Belt buckle with mounted warrior and demon
North China, 2nd — 1st century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Height 2 7/s in. (7.3 cm); width 4.% in. (1 1 . 1 cm)
Lent by Shelby White and Leon Levy
Each of these two mirror-image plaques, which together form
one belt buckle, depicts a narrative scene in which a mounted
warrior grabs the hair of a pot-bellied demon that is wrestling
with a dog. A second dog points at a bird hidden in the nearby
trees while standing on the canopy of a cart pulled by two
reindeer. The landscape setting is indicated by leafy branches.
The plaques were each lost-wax cast from a wax model
formed in a clay mold.
Belt buckles comprising two plaques that have the same
design, as these do, have been recovered from burials at
Xichagou, in northeastern Liaoning Province, 1 and at
Daodunzi, Tongxin county, Ningxia, 2 sites that can be dated
numismatically from the second to the first century b.c.
Reindeer were common draft animals in the Lake Baikal
region, where the Xiongnu had their summer campgrounds.
The kind of cart represented here was used by the Xiongnu,
as well as by other pastoral peoples, in their seasonal migra
tions to transport both belongings and the elderly.
The warrior brandishes a short sword in his raised hand.
This familiar gesture is made also by the warrior on the
Western Han belt hook, catalogue no. 130, and by the mounted
swordsman on the famous mirror in the Hosakawa collection,
said to have come from Jincun, Henan. These similarities
would suggest that the gesture was a Han convention used to
indicate armed readiness and prowess. 3
Narrative scenes such as this one undoubtedly illustrate epi
sodes from oral traditions. Most likely, they are translations into
metal of scenes represented on textiles , which are perishable
artifacts that seldom survive. The transhumant lifestyle of the
nomads dictated their mode of habitation. Their tents had to be
transportable and easily erected and dismantled. And instead of
Plaq
11



walls, textile hangings served to record the heroic tales of their
distant past. One such hanging, in felt, was preserved by acci
dent in a frozen tomb at Pazyryk, in the Altai Mountains. 4
There are remarkable similarities between the motifs found on
bronze plaques and those found on textiles. Even the stepped
triangular design that marks the bottom border of the present
plaques reflects motifs found on Pazyryk textiles. s
The attempt on the present buckle to integrate the figures
into a landscape setting, as well as the foreshortened view of
the horse and rider, can be traced back to Hellenistic tradi
tions prevalent at oasis centers in Central Asia following the
campaigns of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.
Foreshortened views of horses abound in Greek vase paint
ing 6 and later appear in the pictorial traditions of Central Asia
found at sites in Sogdiana, along the Silk Road. 7

Belt buckle with dragon andfantastic creature
China, 1st century B.C.— 1st century a.d.
Gold inlaid with quartz
Height 2 7/s in. (7.3 cm); width 4.% in. (1 1 .7 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Embellished with an extraordinary design in repousse, this
gold belt buckle depicts a crested, lupine dragon entwined
with a fantastic creature distinguished by a serpentine body,
clawed forepaws, inlaid eyes, and thick bushy eyebrows. The
creature faces the buckle's tongue, which represents a beak
or nose, lending it an owl-like appearance. Below this dra
matic confrontation, in the right-hand corner, is a tiny feline
that emerges from behind the creature's body. The buckle
tongue, once movable, is now frozen shut.
The plaque is a superbly crafted example of Han goldsmith
work. The zoomorphic design was produced by hammering
sheet gold over a matrix and then chasing the front surface to
enhance the details. Cryptocrystalline quartz in bezels backed
by cinnabar to add color is used to form the reddish eyes. The
bezels have been fused to the buckle, in an ancient technique
using heated glue and copper salts, an elegant way of joining
gold without solder. Microscopic examination reveals the use
of granulation, producing a border of granules around each
1 12



eye, some of which were displaced when the plaque was
heated.
Buckles of this type have been found throughout the Far
East, from Korea to Xinjiang, at sites contemporary with the
Han period, but no identical example has been published. 1
Nevertheless, the wolflike dragon is similar to animals on sev
eral Thaw artifacts, such as catalogue nos. ioc. and 1 24, sug
gesting a tentative Western Han date. A buckle of the same
shape embellished by inlay was acquired in 1 99 c by the Musee
Cernuschi, Paris, and given a date of the late first century B.C.
to the first century a.d. 2

Belt buckle with ibex and bear
Central Asia, 1 st century B.C. — 1 st century a.d.
Gold inlaid with amber, carnelian, and turquoise
Height 2
]A in. (j.7 cm); width 3% in. (9.^ cm)
Ex coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
An ibex attacked by a bear in a wooded setting adorns this
gold belt buckle. The ibex, with sweeping ridged horns that
extend to its back, has half fallen to its knees, while the bear,
shown standing on its hind legs, bites the ibex's shoulder. A
small leafy tree behind the ibex serves as a kind of stage prop
to suggest a wooded setting. The bear's husky body is distin
guished by a large piece of amber, while a smaller stone,
either carnelian or chalcedony, marks the ibex's shoulder.
Colored stones also accent each tree leaf. The buckle's gold
tongue is fastened by a silver pin, which is now completely
mineralized.
The buckle was lost- wax cast, perhaps from a wax model
made by pressing a sheet of wax in a mold, and the spaces for
the inlay were incorporated into the wax model. There is evi
dence of considerable post-cast tooling followed by chasing
to sharpen the details. The entire surface is burnished. Red
powder, possibly cinnabar, is seen under all the transparent
cryptocrystalline stones, giving them a deeper brown color.
The use of cinnabar to enhance the color of an inlay is
observed on many Western Han inlaid artifacts. Fourteen
rivet holes, all made by puncturing from inside, are seen on
the vertical edge of the plaque.
The animal attack scene on the Thaw buckle is not typical
of late Western Han designs. The small tree with tiny tear
shaped leaves is similar to trees depicted on belt plaques cast
ri 3



by warrior -herdsmen living far north of China, such as on cat
alogue nos. 64, 78, and 80. Amber inlay was not one of the
materials favored by Han goldsmiths, 1 and the prominence of
amber inlay on the Thaw buckle further suggests that it was
not made in China but farther west. The exact location of its
manufacture has not yet been determined.

Belt buckle with dragons
China, ca. 1st century B.C. — 1st century a.d.
Gold inlaid with semiprecious stones
Length 3 Vi in. (9 cm)
Private Collection
This belt buckle, with a curved slit and a movable tongue, is
exquisitely worked in repousse from a single sheet of gold.
The central figure is a spirited dragon with two pointed horns,
large staring eyes, and a gaping mouth. Six cubs are shown
sporting amid spiraling waves. The dragon's sinuous body is
densely covered with fine granulation and punctuated by cir
cular bezels that originally held semiprecious stone inlays. The
small dragons are also embellished with granules accented by
colorful semiprecious stone inlays, and a band of filigree wires
meanders along the border.
Three examples are known among archaeologically recov
ered belt buckles; one from Pyongyang, Korea, a second from
Yanqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and a third
from Anxiang, Hunan Province, China. 1 The buckles from
Pyongyang and Yanqi bear a remarkable resemblance to the
present example in both design and in technique, showing
extensive use of granulation and filigree on a repousse surface.
The buckle from Anxiang presents a more dramatic design,
with a large gemstone set in the middle section of the dragon's
body and a finer, denser granulation neatly arranged in rows.
It also has more semiprecious stone inlays—forty-four
turquoise chips in the bordering frame alone. The highly
refined technique points to a more developed stage of Chinese
goldwork that coincides with the Western Jin date of the tomb.
The most illustrious feature of this buckle is the granula
tion, the minute gold granules fused onto the buckle's surface
to highlight the design and to create a brilliant texture. The
technique was introduced into China in the second half of the
first millennium B.C., probably the result of maritime trade
with countries in South and West Asia, where the use of gran
ulation dates from the third millennium B.C. 2 Evidence for
such transmission is the presence of the granulation found on
small gold fixtures excavated from the tomb of the king of
Nanyue state, in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, who was
buried in the late second century b.c. 3 A gold crown deco
rated with fine granules found at Aluchaideng, Hanggin ban
ner, Inner Mongolia, however, points to a northern route of
transmission over the steppes, suggesting that the technique
may have been brought to China by nomads, who had been a
conduit between China and the West since prehistoric times. 4
By the late Western Han and early Eastern Han, Chinese gold
smiths had mastered the technique and put it to extensive use.
Goldworks with fine granulation have been found at several
Han sites in Hebei, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu^ Given the extravagant
design and extraordinary craftsmanship, this buckle and those
from Pyongyang and Yanqi were most probably made in the
imperial workshops and then presented as gifts to die rulers of
vassal states and governors of distant provinces . ZS

Pair of belt plaques with winged horses
North China, ist century a.d.
Gilded bronze
Height 7?A in. (7 cm); width 4^8 in. (1 1 . 1 cm)
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, Fletcher Fund,
1924 (24.174.6, 7)
Published: Milleker 2000, fig. 109.
A winged horse in full gallop, its mane and tail streaming in
the wind, is cast in relief on each of these belt plaques. In the
background are distant mountains, represented by small, con
secutive triangles, and between the horse's head and forelegs
is a narrow rectangular opening through which the belt was
once tied. The worn gilding blends with the brown patina,
lending the plaques a mellow sheen
Two pairs of buckles that closely resemble the present
example have been found, respectively, in Zhalainoer, Inner
Mongolia, and in Laoheshen, Jilin Province, where early settle
ments of the Xianbei culture were also discovered. 1 A
nomadic people, the Xianbei originated in the northern range
of the Hinggan Mountains in the far northeast of China during
the first millennium B.C. Beginning in the third century a.d. ,
they gradually migrated southward to the vast pasture of what
is today Inner Mongolia. They continued to move southward
in the following centuries, until eventually they controlled
all of North China, establishing the Northern Wei dynasty
in a.d. 386.
Decorative motifs on Xianbei artifacts include horses and
wild animals, which are often represented in groups. The
archaeologist Su Bai has suggested that the winged horse is
probably related to the "heavenly beast in the shape of a horse"
recorded in the Weishu (History of the Wei Dynasty) that led
Emperor Shengwu, one of the founders of Xianbei, in the
southward migration. 2 The archaeological data presently
available does not allow us to firmly identify the winged
horse with the "heavenly beast," but the motif is undoubt
edly associated with Xianbei art and had its origin in the
Eurasian steppes. ZS

Belt buckle with zoomorphic motif
China, ist— 2nd century A. d.
Gold inlaid with glass and carnelian
Height 3 in. (7.6 cm); width 4/8 in. (1 2 .4. cm)
Ex coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
Five animals, both real and mythological, entwined amid
undulating scrolls decorate the surface of this gold buckle. The
scene is in repousse and punctuated by inlays of carnelian and
colored glass. A red powder, probably cinnabar, is found in
and around the stones to enhance their color. The buckle is
made from a single sheet of hammered gold, and the edges
have been folded back to form a raised border. The fourteen
or fifteen small holes just below the border, punched from
the inside, were used for nails to fasten the buckle to a sup
port. It would appear that the entire surface was once cov
ered with lacquer, probably one that was clear and transparent.
Two textile varieties are embedded in the lacquer at the upper
left, one coarser than the other. A mixture of husks and ker
nels, small quartz pebbles (sand), and clay is used as a back
ing, with lacquer as an adhesive.
116
Slightly later in date than catalogue no. 82, the present
buckle can be dated from the first to the second century a.d.
The lupine dragon is smaller, but the design of entwined ani
mals in cloud scrolls is the same.
Although ornate gold buckles such as this one were prob
ably made by Han craftsmen, the buckle type, without a mov
able tongue, was first introduced into China during the Spring
and Autumn period by the pastoral peoples. 1 By the Han
period, the buckle had evolved into the shape represented
here and had acquired a movable tongue.

Many examples of this type are made of cast brass, sug

Ex coll.: Ward & Company, Inc., New York
This square belt buckle depicts a stag with its head turned
backward and its body in profile with all four legs shown. A small
bird beneath the deer, also in profile, perches on one of the back
hooves. The design is cast in openwork within a double-string
border punctuated by a round boss at each corner. The reverse
is provided with a horizontal hook and a horizontal loop on the
border next to the stag's neck and rump, respectively.
The stag is highly stylized, with a wasp waist, arched neck,
and prominently displayed antlers, all developments from ear
lier bronze belts produced in the late second to the first mil

This standing figure of a stag with oversized antlers is repre
sented in the round to serve as a pendant. It is roughly cast by the
lost-wax method, with perforations at the shoulder and haunch.
The hooves are cloven, but the facial features are not detailed.
Small bronze stags similar to this one have been found in
graves at Marlik, in the southwestern Caspian region of
northwestern Iran. 1 Worn on the belt, they were attached by
the perforations. 2 Similar small stag figures are included in
collections around the world. Like many images of horned
ungulates that embodied cultural and spiritual beliefs, their
most recognizable characteristics—antlers—are distinguished
by their size and beauty. 3

Each of these belt plaques is composed of an abstract zoomor
phic design in openwork and indented scrolled lines and has a
vertical loop behind the central boss. The ornaments are piece
mold cast, and the surfaces have been intentionally tinned by
dipping in molten tin without the benefit of mercury. 1
Tinning was frequently used by the pastoral tribes of north
western China and southwestern Inner Mongolia as an
emblem of status, indicating that the owner of a tinned bronze
belt plaque was held in higher regard than the owner of a plain
bronze one. Tinning also imitated the appearance of silver.
Belt ornaments similar to these two were cast in large sets,
which have been excavated at many burial sites of herding
peoples who lived throughout Northwest China beyond the
Taihang Mountains during the latter half of the first millen
nium b.c. 2 The designs ultimately derive from zoomorphic
patterns found on early Eastern Zhou carved jade ornaments. 3
This small belt ornament takes the form of a crouching carni
vore savaging the head of a herbivore, with anatomical details
indicated by intaglio lines. Shown in profile, the carnivore is
distinguished by large curled claws. The texture of the fur on
the tail is suggested by short parallel lines, and a C-shaped arc
marks the shoulder and haunch. The reverse of the plaque dis
plays two heavy vertical loops. Mold marks around the base of
the loops show clearly that the plaque and the loops were inte
grally cast in a multipiece mold.
Eight small belt plaques similar in design to the present
example were excavated from a fifth-century burial at
Fanjiayaozi, Horinger county, south-central Inner Mongolia. 1
This would suggest that the present ornament was also part of
a set of plaques that served to adorn a belt.
119



The motif of a carnivore attacking a herbivore, here rep
resented only by its head, first appeared in the art of the Near
East and was adopted by the pastoral peoples of the Eurasian
steppes during the first millennium b.c. 1 The subject appealed
because it was drawn from daily life and reflected the harsh
experiences of the herdsmen. The image could also confer its
power and strength on the wearer. As the motif was trans
mitted eastward, the West Asian lion was replaced by the East
Asian predator — the tiger, the wolf, the leopard — specific to
each region. The convention of representing a victim by its
head was anticipated on an early-first-millennium B.C. deer
stone from Uusgijn iiiiver, Hovsgol aimag, in northern
Mongolia. 3

Belt plaque in the shape of a recumbent tiger
North China and south-central Inner Mongolia, jth century b.c.
Bronze
Height 1 V2 in. (3.8 cm); width iVi in. (6.4 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This openwork belt plaque depicts a recumbent tiger with its
head turned back and grasping in its jaws the horns of a
gazelle's head. The head of another gazelle is shown above the
tiger's tail. The tiger's body is decorated with curved lines
and C-shaped spirals, and its eyes and those of the gazelles'
heads are indicated by unnatural- looking indented circles. A
row of parallel lines lends a furry texture to the tiger's tail.
The reverse displays two strong vertical loops, and mold
marks around the base of the loops, similar to those on cata
logue nos. 59, 140, and 141 , indicate piece-mold casting.
The linear curves and angles that embellish the tiger's body
may relate to patterns on Zhou bronzes of the fifth century B.C.
from Liyu, Hunyuan county, northern Shanxi Province. 1 The
Liyu bronzes were cast at Houma, the famous Jin state
foundry in southern Shanxi, which may have served a far wider
market than has hitherto been realized. Conversely, the animal
combat theme appears abruptly in the bronze vocabulary of
Jin in the fifth century, suggesting that cultural influence ran
both ways.
There are variations of this plaque in both public and pri
vate collections. 3 The design of the present example is so
pleasing that it was the model for several forgeries cast during
the first half of the twentieth century. Such pieces are now
easily recognizable because they are cast by the lost-wax
method; authentic plaques are piece-mold cast. 4

Belt plaque in the shape of a Bacthan camel
with rider
Northwest China, Ningxia, 4th century b.c.
Bronze
Height 2 Vs in. (c.4 cm); width iVi in. (6.4 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This belt ornament is cast in the shape of a kneeling Bactrian
camel with a rider sitting between the two humps. The
camel's legs are folded beneath it in such a way that the bot
tom of one hind hoof lies atop that of the front hoof. The eye
is a boss within a circular groove, and the shaggy hair is ren
1 2o



dered by a fringelike strip along the neck. Dressed in a long
belted jacket worn over trousers, the rider is shown with his
head turned back, perhaps holding a goad in his left hand, and
with his right hand high on the camel's neck, presumably
holding a rein attached to a nose peg. The reverse of the
plaque, slightly concave and with a slanting loop that extends
from one hump to the lower rump area, displays turned-up
edges, suggesting that it was cast by the lost-wax process.
A plaque that depicts the identical scene was recently
unearthed in Pengyang, Guyuan county, southern Ningxia. 1
As late as the twentieth century, herds of wild camels still
roamed the area around Etsingol, Ningxia. Like the rider on
the present example, the rider on the Pengyang plaque has a
prominent nose, identifying him as a foreigner who has
arrived in Northwest China via the trans- Asian Silk Road. The
existence of similar plaques in mirror image suggests that the
present piece once had a counterpart to complete the buckle 2
Camels appear on a number of belt ornaments, tokens of the
owner's wealth.
The artisans who designed plaques representing camels
obviously knew their subject well. Camels grind and regurgi
tate their food, so that it is impossible to place a bit in their
mouths as one would with a horse; thus, no bridle is used,
and no bridle is represented on the plaque. Instead, a peg is
inserted in one nostril, with a single rein attached to it, by
which the camel is led. Camels are also notoriously uncoop
erative and must be encouraged to move with a goad, which
the rider on the present plaque may have in his left hand.
The two-humped Bactrian camel was native to Central
Asia, while the habitat of the single-humped dromedary was
the Arabian peninsula and North Africa. 3 Both species were
eventually used in trade along the Silk Road but were
unknown in China until the fourth century b.c. +

This openwork tinned bronze belt plaque represents a stand

lock of hair that extends down the neck, is represented in
profile with all four legs shown. Each of the paws displays four
front claws and one dewclaw, and the open mouth reveals
two rounded teeth and two sharp fangs. The gazelle appears
to be in a crumpled heap, its head in profile and ribbed horn
pointing toward the feline's mouth. The reverse of the plaque
has two tiny vertical loops, one behind the head and one behind
the haunches, and the plaque was cast integrally with the loops
in a multipiece mold. The front has been tinned by wiping the
surface with molten tin without the aid of mercury 1
1 21



A silver plaque excavated at Shihuigou, Eijin Horo banner,
southwestern Inner Mongolia, shows nearly the same figures,
suggesting that the present example can be associated with the
nomadic peoples living in that area. 2 Even the ear on the
Shihuigou plaque is spiraled. The entire composition, includ
ing the spiral treatment of the ear, can be traced back to the
tigers carved on a wooden coffin from Bashadar, in the Altai
Mountains of southern Siberia (fig. 32).

Belt plaque in the shape of a standing wolf
Northwest China, 4th century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 2 Vi in. (6.4 cm); width 4V2 in. (1 1 .4 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This bronze belt plaque shows a standing wolf about to anni
hilate a doe that it holds in its raised left forepaw. The doe's
head appears under the wolf's open jaws, which reveal four
teeth and two fangs about to sink into the doe's succulent
flesh. The doe's hindquarters, underneath the wolf's left
forepaw, are twisted 1 80 degrees. A tiny wolf pup appears on
the ground line between the wolf's front and back legs. The
wolf's ear is a distinctive comma shape, and its pelt is marked
by a variety of linear patterns that include braided bands,
scrolls, dots, and scales. Both the crest and the tail terminate
in an eared raptor's head. Shiny patches occur here and there,
evidence that the piece was intentionally tinned. A loop with
a projecting hook is tangent to the wolf's muzzle, and a ver
tical loop is placed behind the haunches. The plaque has thick,
turned -over edges visible on the reverse, indicating that it was
cast by the indirect lost-wax method. In some areas, the joins
between sections of the wax model are still visible. It can also
be seen that the openings in the plaque were carved through
from the front of the wax model.
The plaque originally had a matching mirror-image plate,
similar to an example currently in a Swiss collection, that
would have completed the buckle. 1 A comparable plaque dat
ing from the fourth century B.C. was discovered in the vicin
ity of Guyuan county, southern Ningxia. 2 The textured pelt
on the present plaque is related to spiral designs found on a
bone carving also excavated in Guyuan 3 and to applique work
from fourth- century b.c. tombs at Pazyryk, in the Altai
Mountains. The convention of inverting the victim's hindquar
ters is seen in the art of southern Siberia, at both Bashadar and



Pazyryk. 4 The rounded form of the teeth derives from a
wood-carving tradition, such as that seen on wooden artifacts
from Bashadar and Pazyryk/ suggesting a distant connection
between the Qingyang region and the Altai. 6
The raptors' -head appendages associate this wolf with the
mythological animals tattooed on the man from kurgan 2 at
Pazyryk (fig. 37), and the iconography appears on artifacts
from Northwest China, in southern Ningxia and the Qingyang
region of southeastern Gansu during the second half of the
fourth century b.c. It also occurs later, around the late fourth
to the third century B.C. , in the Ordos Desert region. 7

Northwest China, 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2/^in. (7 cm); width^^in. (12.1 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This openwork belt plaque takes the form of a standing car
nivore with an upswept tail. The pointed ear and long muzzle
suggest a wolf, a predator often represented on non-Chinese
artifacts from Northwest China. Each paw displays four
prominent claws that curve forward and a dewclaw that
curves in the opposite direction. The pointed ear is an
inverted heart, and C-shaped volutes mark the legs and body.
The slightly open jaws reveal fangs and teeth with which the
carnivore grips a serpentine zoomorph, and a mass of squirm
ing two-legged creatures surrounds the carnivore's legs.
Projecting from the front is a hook adjacent to a square per
foration in the carnivore's shoulder. The reverse displays a
mushroom-shaped stud behind the rump. The plaque was cast
by the lost-wax process, and joins in the wax are reproduced
in the metal on the back.
The plaque depicts a totally Sinicized version of an animal
combat scene. Originally, it was the left-hand plaque of a mir
ror-image pair that together constituted one complete buckle.
123



Plaques of the same shape and similar style were discovered on
the Qingyang plateau in southeastern Gansu Province. 1
Additional examples without archaeological provenience are
included in numerous collections. A plaque in the Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, Washington, D.C., is nearly identical to the
present one. 2
Like catalogue nos . 6 2 and 6 3 , this plaque was probably
made by Chinese craftsmen specifically for steppe consump
tion. Such buckles do not appear as personal ornaments in

This openwork plaque features a mythological animal whose
hindquarters are rotated 1 80 degrees. The animal has a horse
like head, body, and hooves, but a beaked muzzle and long
antlers. Raptors' heads that grow out of the tail and antlers
join with the head and hind legs, forming the rectangular frame,
and the fluid lines and modeling that define the physical attrib
utes provide a sense of volume. The surface of the plaque,
particularly near the head, antlers, and tail, is moderately cor
roded, but the flank and hindquarters are largely intact and
retain traces of gold, indicating that the metal was once exten
sively mercury gilded. On the back are three loops, one
behind the head and two behind the haunches and hind legs. 1
A striking image, this composite creature exemplifies
the transmission of a motif that the nomads brought from the
shores of the Black Sea to the northern border of China in
the last centuries of the first millennium B.C. It appears to have
evolved from the image of a stag and gradually acquired other
attributes. By the fifth century B.C. , it had emerged in Scythian
art as an ungulate with a prominent beak and elaborate antler
tines from which sprout raptors' heads. The earliest evidence
of this image in North China is an ornament of a headdress
discovered at a mid- to late Warring States site at Nalin'gaotu,
Shaanxi Province, where the Chinese had frequent contact
with the pastoral peoples. 2 The motif continued in the artis
tic vocabulary of the area in the following centuries until the
Western Han dynasty, as evidenced by a number of orna
mental plaques found in North China and Inner Mongolia. The
dramatic twist of the animal's hindquarters was a far-reaching
characteristic, eventually making its way to the heartland of
China. It is found on the cover of a lacquer box, a typical
Chinese product, in a Chu tomb of the third century B.C., in
Changsha, Hunan Province. 3 zs

1 . Recent tests have confirmed the antiquity of this buckle. X-ray
fluorescence (XRF) analysis indicates that the metal was refined by the
traditional method of cupellation and the corrosion on the surface
formed under archaeological conditions. Microscopic examination at
high magnification reveals fine copper precipitates and disruption at
the silver grain boundaries, which are typical of copper-bearing silver
of archaeological age. This buckle was published previously as a for
gery (Bunker 1989).

Belt plaque in the shape of a tiger and a kulan
Northwest China, 3rd century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2 A in. (^.7 cm); width 3 % in. (9.3 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This openwork belt plaque shows the profile image of a tiger
walking off with its victim, a kulan, in its jaws. The four paws
have powerful arched claws, and the pelt is marked by raised
chevrons. Both the eye and the ear are represented by a raised
oval. The tail hangs down and terminates in an inward curl.
The kulan is shown hanging limply from the tiger's grasp, its
tongue lolling out of its mouth. Its body is represented
unnaturally — in a conventional recumbent pose with folded
legs. Visible evidence that the openwork holes were cut
through the wax model from the front and a thickened, turned
over rim on the reverse are the result of lost-wax casting.
The plaque is the wearer's left-hand half of a mirror
image pair that originally constituted a complete belt buckle.
No identical buckle has been found in archaeological context,
but plaques that illustrate the same scene have been excavated
at Guoxianyaozi, Liangcheng county, south- central Inner
Mongolia,' and in Jianghecun, near Yanglang, southern
Ningxia. 2 The Guoxianyaozi example even depicts the same
victim in the same incongruous leg pose. A mirror-image ver
sion of the present plaque was collected in the western out
skirts of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. 3 These discoveries suggest
that the present example can be associated with the pastoral
nomads of the northwestern frontier of China during the third
century B.C.

Belt plaque in the shape of a wild boar
Northwest China, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Height 2 A in. ( 7 cm); width \h in. (11 .4 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
This gilded bronze plaque represents a standing wild boar
shown in profile. The reverse is concave and displays two pairs
of tiny horizontal loops, one behind the haunch and the other
behind the head. The plaque was cast by the lost- wax process,
with the perforations in the design cut through the wax model
from the front. The loops were formed by two pieces of wax
attached to one another, and integrally cast with the plaque,
which was then mercury gilded, creating a new surface enrich
ment that was often employed to enhance belt ornaments dur
ing the third century B.C. 1
To date, no identical plaque has been found in archaeolog
ical context, but the Palace Museum, Beijing, owns a mirror
image pair 2 A single plaque in the collection of George Ortiz
is the mirror image of the present example and may originally
have been its mate. 3

Pair of belt plaques with ungulate and ram
North China, 3rd— 2nd century b.c.
Bronze
Each: Height r % in. (4.8 cm); width 4 in. (10 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
Each of these two mirror-image belt plaques depicts a mytho
logical ungulate with its hindquarters twisted 1 80 degrees and
followed by a half-crouching ram. The series of raptors' heads
at the top border append to the tips of the ungulate's antlers.
Each plaque originally had two vertical loops soldered onto the
reverse, although one plaque is now missing a loop. The plaques
are extremely heavy and were probably piece-mold cast.
The wearer's left-hand plaque is not perforated, which
indicates that the two plaques do not form a buckle. Instead,
they must have served as additional plaques to enrich a
warrior-herdsman's belt. On one plaque, textile fragments
are still visible in the corrosion on the back and up the edge,
suggesting either that the original belt was made of cloth or
that the plaques were wrapped in cloth when buried.
No plaques with identical scenes are known, but both the
ungulate and ram figures are represented in similar designs on
other belt ornaments cast between the third and the first cen
tury B.C. , when the Xiongnu were the dominant herding peo
ple on China's northern frontier. 1

Belt plaque with horse and wolf
North China, 3rd— 2nd century b.c.
Bronze
Height 1 % in. (4.4. cm); width 3 % in. (8.3 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
The animal combat on this belt plaque shows a recumbent
horse being attacked by a wolf. The scene is shown within a
rectangular frame with a simulated twisted rope border, and
striations suggesting fur mark the horse's body. The wolf is
represented only by its head and forepaws, with which it
grasps the horse's neck and rump. The ornament appears to
have been piece-mold cast, with the two vertical squared
loops on the reverse soldered on afterward. Originally, it was
the right-hand counterpart of a mirror-image pair that
together formed one belt buckle.
A plaque in the British Museum, London, is the mirror
image of the Thaw plaque and displays a perforation in the
horse's shoulder that is part of the fastening device. ' A simi
lar recumbent horse image occurs among the zoomorphic rep
resentations on a pair of plaques in the Therese and Erwin
Harris collection. 2
A bone belt plaque of an earlier date, in the shape of a
recumbent horse from Sagli-Bazhi II in western Tuva, has
curvilinear carved shoulder and haunch markings that accen
tuate the musculature, which is not unlike the patterns on the
Harris and Thaw horses. 3 These similarities again serve to
demonstrate how the artistic motifs and visual symbolism of
the pastoral peoples were transmitted from one geographic
region to another. Whether this transmission was the result of
migration, warfare, or commercial interaction must be deter
mined in each case.

This handsome silver plaque takes the form of a kneeling
horse. While the well-modeled shoulders and haunches dis
play its brawny strength, the pointed ears, staring eyes, and
large, flared nostrils describe its lively spirit. The trimmed
mane is represented by a row of small rectangles, and the
curved tail, indicated by sunken lines, is tucked between the
hind legs. The articulated joints and naturalistically modeled
torso are characteristic of Chinese metalwork of the third
through the first century B.C., but the teardrop-shaped hooves
and ears denote the artistic influence of Central Asia. The con
cave back of the plaque bears the imprint of a textile pattern,
the result of using the lost-wax lost-textile technique in the
manufacturing process. Developed for the casting of thin
plaques, this technique involved the use of fabric to reinforce
the wax model.
For the pastoral peoples, the horse was not only the princi
pal means of transportation but a dependable partner in life on
the steppes. Their love for the horse is found in its represen
tation on weapons, clothing, and everyday utensils. Ornament
plaques decorated with the image of horses are frequently
encountered at archaeological sites in North and Northwest
China. A bronze plaque with a similar image of a kneeling
horse was excavated from a second-to-first century B.C. tomb
at Tongxin county, Ningxia, in 1985/ and a silver plaque in
the British Museum, London, as well as a gilded bronze plaque
in the Museum fur Ostasiatische Kunst, Berlin, are nearly mir
ror images of the present example. 2 ZS

Two belt plaques with dragon and tortoises
North China, 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Each: Height i A in. (4.4 cm); width 3V2 in. (8.9 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London; J. J. Lally & Co., New York;
Calon da Collection
Published: So and Bunker 199^, p. 158, no. 80.
An openwork design showing a large figure-eight-shaped
dragon wrapped around two tortoises within a simulated rope
border constitutes each of these two rectangular plaques. The
plaques are not a pair. Rather, each one is the wearer's left
hand plaque of a complete buckle, indicated by the presence
on each plaque of an aperture on the edge; on a buckle pair,
only one is required. The plaques were cast by the lost- wax
process, with loops soldered onto the back.
Many plaques with this design have been excavated from the
tombs of local pastoral peoples at Daodunzi, Tongxin county,
Ningxia. 1 They have also been unearthed among the grave
goods of the king of Nanyue in Guangzhou, Guangdong. 2
The dragon has a lupine head seen in profile and is star
tlingly similar to dragons on many Han artifacts, 3 suggesting
that some contact with the Eurasian steppe world may have
stimulated the development of the Han image. 4 The dragon
with a lupine head is comparable to another openwork belt
plaque of a type known to have been cast in the north, where
in the artistic vocabulary of the region the wolf played a
prominent role as a predator. (See also cat. no. ior.)

Belt plaque withfeline and ram
North China, 2nd century b.c.
Gilded bronze
Height 2 in. (^.r cm); width 4 in. (10.2 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
An animal-combat scene between a feline and a ram is
depicted on this single belt plaque, which originally must have
had a mirror-image mate. The drama of the combat has been
suppressed in favor of a pleasing, balanced design. The
hindquarters of both protagonists are gracefully twisted 180
degrees, and their tails terminate in eared raptors' heads. Like
many other plaques cast during the second century b.c,
curved striated enclosures mark the animals' bodies. The
reverse is completely flat and displays two soldered vertical
attachment loops. The plaque is quite heavy and was probably
piece -mold cast.
Numerous plaques with similar scenes are found in several
collections. One pair was excavated in a non-Chinese ceme
tery at Daodunzi, Tongxin county, Ningxia, 1 and another was
discovered among the exotica in the tomb of the king of Nan
yue in Guangzhou, Guangdong. 2 The raptor's tail terminals
relate this scene to the mythology that governs the symbol
ism on several other plaques in the Thaw collection . The stri
ations are not unlike the markings on a bone cylinder, for
example (cat. no. 1^9), suggesting that such texturing first
developed in carving or leatherwork. As with other plaques
discussed in this section, the animal-combat scene is enclosed
within an imitation rope frame.

Belt plaque withfighting stallions
Southern Siberia, 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2 K in. (5.7 cm); width c in. (12.7 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This openwork belt plaque depicts two fighting, rut-crazed
stallions. They are identified as Przewalski horses by their
short, upright manes. A leafy setting at the top and sunken
rectangles along the bottom edge and sides serve to frame the
scene. The shoulder of each stallion is marked by a tear-shaped
depression, and similar sunken areas mark the ears, nostrils,
hooves, and leaves. The plaque was originally one of a pair,
with identical scenes that together formed a complete belt
buckle. It has no hook on the front, which indicates that it was
worn on the right-hand side. The reverse is concave and has no
loops. The plaque was cast by the indirect lost- wax process.
An earlier version of this scene was excavated in eastern
Mongolia. 1 The Mongolian plaque shows a branching, leafy
tree behind the two stallions; the tree has been reduced to just
a few leaves on the present example, which must be slightly
later in date. Numerous examples of this plaque have been
found throughout Buryatia and southern Siberia in graves asso
ciated with the Xiongnu. 5 One example was also found in
eastern Xinjiang, 3 and many other similar examples are in
both private and public collections. 4
The composition of this particular scene of combat, in
which the stallion on the right bites the leg of the horse on the
left, which in turn bites the shoulder of the stallion, appears
to have developed many centuries earlier, when it portrayed
two fighting camels, a motif that has been found on gold
plaques excavated from a fourth-century b.c. kurgan in
Filippovka, southern Russia/

Belt plaque with tigers and dragon
Mongolia and eastern Siberia, 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2% in. (6.7 cm); width jVi in. (14 cm)
Ex coll.: Tony Anninos, California
Two fierce tigers attacking a dragon with a horned, lupine
head are shown on this openwork rectangular belt plaque. The
scene is framed by a series of tear-shaped depressions. The
plaque was cast from a wax model formed in a two-piece mold,
indicated by pressure marks on the reverse, which is slightly
concave and lacks attachment loops. The alloy is copper with
small quantities of lead and a minimal amount of arsenic, an
alloy characteristic of plaques found in Mongolia and Siberia. 1
A mirror-image pair of plaques, each of which carries the
same design as the present example, was excavated from a
second-century B.C. grave in a Xiongnu cemetery at Ivolga,
near Lake Baikal, in Buryatia, a region thought to be the sum
mer camping grounds of the Xiongnu. 2 The plaques were
found at the waist of a female and thought to be clan insignia.
All three plaques are also identical to the nephrite plaque in a
private collection, catalogue no. 106.
The lupine-headed dragon appears to have been important
in the iconography of the Xiongnu, as it occurs in a variety of
compositions, including two plaques identical to catalogue
no. 1 02 that were excavated at Daodunzi, Tongxin county,
Ningxia. 3 The Xiongnu dragon may be one antecedent of the
elongated dragon so popular in China during the Han dynasty. 4
A strikingly similar dragon occurs on certain Western Han
incense burners. s
A source for the design of these dragon-and-tiger combat
plaques is provided by an earlier pair of gold plaques discov
ered in a tomb at Szidorovka, near Omsk, western Siberia, a
site dated from the late third to the second century B.C. 6 The
three plaques carry the same scene; the only difference between
them is that the gold plaques are solid, not openwork, and are
inlaid with turquoise, coral, and amber (fig. 44-). The gold
examples were found at the waist of a thirty- to thirty-five-year
old man of mixed Europoid- Mongoloid type.
This stunning new find clearlv demonstrates that a tradition
of inlay work lies behind the tear-shaped cells that mark the
tigers' pelts and the border of the present example, as well as
1 33



many other similar plaques. Another important discovery is
the identification of a woven pattern on the back of the
Szidorovka gold plaques, indicating that they were cast by the
lost- wax and lost-textile process. 7

A sinuous dragon with a horned, wolflike head being attacked
by two fierce tigers is depicted on this openwork nephrite
plaque. The dragon's body is marked by longitudinal parallel
grooves, and the tigers' bodies have irregular indented tear
shapes within raised rims that suggest a striped pelt. More reg
ular tear-shaped marks embellish the rectangular frame . Like
the other nephrite plaque in the exhibition (cat. no. 114), this
one may once have been fitted into something of metal, with
the two semicircular cuts at either edge used as an attachment
device. A reddish substance identified as cinnabar is visible in
some of the indented areas.
The combat scene is virtually identical to that on a belt
buckle excavated from the second-century B.C. Xiongnu
cemetery in Ivolga, Buryatia, and to catalogue no. 1 o^.
The plaque is carved from a dark green nephrite of a type
found in Mongolia and eastern Siberia, suggesting that it was
carved locally rather than in China. 1 It has not been deter
mined whether the Xiongnu had developed the intricate tech
nique of carving nephrite, but Chinese artisans are known to
have been employed at the Xiongnu northern stronghold in
Ivolga, and they may well have carved this plaque. That it may
have been carved in China does not seem plausible, since
plaques with this design have never been found there or in the
nearby frontier regions

Ex coll.: Throckmorton Fine Art, Inc., New York
A feline dragon, its body twisted into a figure eight, is shown
on the surface of this belt plaque . Originally one of a mirror
image pair that together formed a complete belt buckle, it is
rectangular in shape, with a simulated double-rope border. A
loop tangent to the left side is part of the closure device, and
two vertical loops that project from the back are provided for
attachment. The plaque was cast by the lost- wax process and
then mercury gilded, and the loops appear to be soldered on.
The plaque is an interesting mixture of northern and
Chinese elements. Buckles formed by two mirror-image
plaques are an invention of the eastern Eurasian steppes, while
the feline dragon is an auspicious Han Chinese motif. It is
depicted on many Western Han artifacts, especially jades dat
ing to the second and first centuries B.C. 1 Such an unusual
combination suggests that the buckle may have been made for
elite Chinese consumption, perhaps for someone with a taste
for northern exotica. 2

Two belt plaques with three ibex
Northwest China, 2nd— ist century B.C.
Bronze
Each: Height 2% in. (6.7 cm); width $Vi in. (1 3.9 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
Published: Hotel Drouot 1996, no. 38.
Each of these openwork belt buckles takes the form of two
frontal ibex in a wooded setting, their bodies in profile and the
foreleg of each raised and hooked over a branch or tree trunk.
Between the two ibex stands a third, shown frontally. One tree
rises behind each flanking ibex, and two trees, one on either
side of the plaque, serve as the frame. The slightly concave
reverse has no attachment loops. Each plaque was cast by the
lost- wax process from a wax model formed in a mold.
The two plaques do not constitute one complete belt
buckle. Rather, they are both left-hand plaques belonging to
different buckles. Each has the characteristic curved hook that
protrudes from the right side of the plaque, although the hook
on the right plaque has been filed off.
No plaque with three ibex has been archaeologically exca
vated, but such ornaments are included in several private col
lections .
1 A similar plaque with only two ibex shown was
unearthed from a Xiongnu tomb at Lijiataozi, Tongxin
county, Ningxia, along with wuzhu coins of a type not minted
before 118 B.C. 2 Plaques such as the present examples reflect
the new emphasis on real animals in naturalistic settings that
characterizes the design of belt ornaments made during the
late first millennium B.C. for the Xiongnu.

This sensitively designed and beautifully cast openwork gold
plaque is made in the shape of a grazing kulan shown in profile.
Naturalistically represented, it has an almond-shaped eye,
articulated muscles, and a long tail marked by ridges. The
reverse has two flat attachment straps behind the shoulder and
haunches, and there is ample evidence of wear. The plaque
was cast by the lost- wax process.
No gold plaques similar to this one have been excavated,
but a bronze example that is nearly identical in shape was dis
covered in a Xiongnu grave at Daodunzi, Tongxin county,
Ningxia. 1 Many plaques that depict two confronted grazing
horses in a similar pose have been discovered in the Minusinsk

the Xiongnu during their period of expansion in the last few

This small openwork plaque takes the form of a grazing ibex.
Characterized by arching ridged horns, a beard, and a con
ventionalized round eye, the ibex is shown with its body in
profile and with all four legs represented. Tiny triangular
cells, perhaps derived from an earlier inlay tradition, mark
the hooves. There are no attachment loops on the reverse,
but the circular aperture in the shoulder and the loop formed
by the short tail perhaps served the same purpose. The plaque
was made by casting and hammering.
Numerous plaques cast in bronze in a shape similar to this
one have been found throughout Transbaikal, Buryatia, and
Mongolia, 1 where they can be associated with the Xiongnu.

Belt plaque with Bactrian camel
North China, 2nd— ist century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Height 2^4 in. (£.7 cm); width 3//2in. (8.9 cm)
Ex coll.: Ariadne Galleries, Inc., New York
A Bactrian camel shown in a half-crouching position within a
simulated rope frame constitutes this openwork belt plaque.
Highly naturalistic, the representation includes such anatom
ical details as fur and a shaggy mane. The horns of a bovine
mask placed sideways under the camel's head form an open
vertical slot that is part of the fastening device. On the reverse
is a vertical loop behind the camel's rump that appears to be
soldered on. The plaque is lost-wax cast from a wax model
formed in a mold.
No plaques similar to this one have been found in archae
logical context. The mask is far more Chinese than steppe in
conception. The rounded ridges at the base of the horns are
characteristic features of small bovine-headed ornaments
found in elite Western Han tombs, such as those in Mancheng,
Hebei Province, 1 and Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. 2
These similarities suggest that the plaque was made for the
northern market at a Han metalworking center but not based
on northern imagery. 3

A crouching camel in high relief within a herringbone
patterned frame is represented on this clay casting model.
Such models were used by artisans to form mother molds in
which wax models were made for use in the lost-wax process.
The models could be used to mass-produce bronze plaques
and could be made of metal, clay, or stone, such as a steatite
example in the British Museum, London. 1
Few casting models have survived, or they are not recog
nized as such, 2 which makes the existence of this plaque cru
cial to our understanding of China's ancient casting processes.
A few casting models are found in Western museum collec

Height 2 Vb in. .4 cm); width \h in. ( 1 1 . 7 cm)
Ex coll. : Michael Dunn, New York
This openwork belt plaque depicts two bovines with frontal
heads and profile bodies showing all four legs and set within a
narrow rectangular frame. The reverse is slightly concave and
without loops. The alloy has small amounts of tin, arsenic, and
lead, and the plaque was cast by the lost- wax process, while the
wax model was probably formed in a two-piece mold.
Several versions of this plaque have been found throughout
North China, Mongolia, and southern Siberia, wherever the
Xiongnu expanded their rule during the early Western Han.
One example was excavated at Xichagou, Xifeng county,
Liaoning Province, 1 and others at sites in southern Siberia. 2
The presence of arsenic in the alloy is characteristic of plaques
cast in southern Siberia. 3

Belt plaque with ox
North China, 2nd— ist century B.C.
Nephrite and gilded bronze
Height 1 % in. (4_.r cm); width 2% in. (7.2 cm)
Private Collection
Published: Rawson 199^, pp. 312—13, no. 23:3.
Carved with the figure of an ox, this openwork nephrite
plaque is set within a gilded bronze frame embellished with
two sinuous felines whose frontal masks appear at opposite
corners. The frame was made expressly to fit the irregular
shape of the plaque. The back of the piece is flat and displays
two vertical loops for attachment.

The figure of the ox is very similar to the oxen on cata
logue no. 6 c, two mirror- image belt plaques in the Thaw col
lection. The present plaque, in a private collection, is an
excellent illustration of an exotic steppe motif's having been
adopted as a xiangrui (an auspicious omen) by the Chinese dur
ing the Western Han dynasty and then carefully Sinicized by
enclosing it within a typically Chinese gilded bronze frame
With its blend of steppe and Chinese motifs, this ornament
clearly demonstrates the close cultural contact between the
herding and the agricultural worlds that had developed by the
end of the third century B.C. Whether it was intended to be
worn by an elite Chinese antiquarian with a taste for the exotic
or was an elaborate gift for an elite Xiongnu herdsman cannot
be determined, but it is an important visual reminder of the
intercultural relationship that existed between the two peoples.

Belt plaque withjallen stag
Western Eurasia, 2nd— 1st century B.C.
Gold inlaid with semiprecious stones
Height 3 in. (7.6 cm) ; width 4.% in. ( 1 1 . 7 cm)
Lent by Shelby White and Leon Levy
This gold openwork belt plaque depicts an animal-combat
scene in which a raptor and a feline savage a fallen stag. The
animals' bodies and the tear shapes on the frame are accented
with turquoise inlays placed in bezels, and the eyes are perhaps
inlaid with opaque calcite or shell. The buckle was formed by
casting and hammering, and the edges appear to have been
chisel cut. The reverse displays the remains of four attachment
loops, one in each corner, that were attached by soldering.
The palmate-shaped antlers of the stag identify it as a fal
low deer, a species known to have inhabited Northwest Asia
in antiquity. A similar animal- combat scene, with the same
cast of zoomorphs, decorates an ointment container excavated
at Novocherkassk, a major Sarmatian site in the Rostov region
of southern Russia, dated to the second century B.C. 1 The rap
tors on both the present plaque, in the Shelby White and Leon
Levy collection, and the Novocherkassk container have round
140



birds' eyes and should thus technically be identified as eagles
rather than as mythological griffins, which traditionally had
almond-shaped eyes. 2
The White — Levy plaque exemplifies the so-called
Sarmatian polychrome style, which preceded and may have
influenced the development of the superb plaques and buck
les produced during the Migration period (ca. a.d. 400 — 800)
throughout most of Europe.

Belt plaque with animals in a landscape
North China, 1st century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Height 2//4 in. (4". 7 cm); width 4^8 in. (11. 1 cm)
Ex coll.: Ariadne Galleries, Inc., New York
A complex landscape scene is shown on this gilded bronze belt
plaque. Two camels stride past Asian elms and mountains,
behind which are six wild boars, three facing right and three
facing left. Two horses are seen diving headfirst down the
sides of the plaque, and the entire scene is enclosed within a
simulated rope border. The reverse displays two vertical loops
and the characteristic woven pattern resulting from the lost
wax and lost-textile casting process.
No identical plaques have yet been archaeologically exca
vated, but several similar pieces in private collections are
known. 1 The present example is the wearer's right-hand
plaque of a matched pair, as it has neither hole nor hook. Each
camel holds a branch of the Asian elm in its mouth, just like
the camels on catalogue no. 79.
The scene on this ornament is quite perplexing. Belt
plaques are associated primarily with the northern pastoral
peoples, but a landscape scene on such a plaque is highly
unusual. If the plaque was made for a Chinese aristocrat with
a taste for exotica, it might be interpreted as representing ani
mals living in harmony with nature, a favorite xiangrui (auspi
cious) design characterized by a fantastic mountain landscape
teeming with animals. Such a scene could reflect the "correl
ative thinking" of the early Chinese, which was frequently
expressed in terms of animals and mountains, as in the fol
lowing passage from the Shiii (Records of the Grand
Historian): "As . . . wild beasts congregate in the most
141



secluded mountains, so benevolence and righteousness attach
themselves to a man of wealth." 3
If, on the other hand, the plaque was made by Han Chinese
craftsmen for northern, pastoral consumption, we may be
ascribing Chinese ideas to a landscape scene made only to
appeal to nomadic taste. This interpretive dilemma is one that
continually faces scholars who deal with artifacts from the
steppes, since the pastoral peoples left no written records to
explain the meaning of their designs.

Bronze
Height 3 Vs in. (7.9 cm); width 4J4 in. (10.5 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Laity & Co., New York
This openwork belt plaque , which may originally have been
one of a matched pair, shows two confronted rams within a
rectangular frame and wheel-shaped forms that fill the spaces
beneath and between the two animals. 1 On the reverse, the
animals' bodies are concave and the border areas flat. The
plaque has a very high copper content and is lost- wax cast.
A plaque of gold that carries the same scene of confronted
rams and wheel shapes was found at a Xianbei site in
Tianmiliang, eastern Inner Mongolia, 2 and other bronze exam
ples are in public and private collections. 3 A plaque with a
similar zoomorphic design was found in Huachi county, Gansu
Province, an area once part of the vast territory under the
control of the Xianbei. 4 The back of the Huachi plaque is tech
nically similar to the present example, having been cast with
the animal bodies concave and the rest of the design flat.

BELT ORNAMENTS : HOOKS
1 18
Garment hook in the shape of afeline
North or Northwest China, 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2/8 in. (5.4 cm); width 4/8 in. (io.c cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
This garment hook was cast in the form of a feline with its
head turned back 180 degrees. Only one front leg and one
hind leg are shown, each ending in a small three-clawed paw.
The feline's body is marked by raised chevrons that suggest
its striped fur pelt, and its open mouth reveals sharp, menac
ing canines. A collar encircles the throat, and a long plain hook
extends sideways from the neck. The reverse has a button that
projects on a stem from behind the neck. Crescent-shaped
mold-join seams flanking the button indicate that the garment
hook and button were integrally cast in a multisection mold.
The collar around the feline's neck indicates that it is a
trained hunting animal. References abound in both art and lit
erature to trained falcons, dogs, leopards, and cheetahs used
in hunting throughout history. 1 Feline-shaped garment hooks
similar to the present example are represented in collections
around the world, but none have been found in archaeologi
cal context. The type of multisection mold that would have
been needed to cast this hook integrally with its button is
related to casting traditions found at Houma, the Jin state
foundry site in southern Shanxi. 2 It is possible that hooks of
this type, which are rather roughly cast, may have been made
by the pastoral nomads on China's northwestern frontier
using section-mold techniques borrowed from their Chinese
neighbors to the south.

Belt hook in the shape of an ungulate
Northwest China, rth century b.c.
Bronze
Height 2^/2 in. (6.4 cm); width 3/8 in. (9.8 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This belt hook takes the form of a fantastic ungulate with only two
legs shown and its head turned backward. The actual hook is
created by the tail of another, smaller creature that grasps the
ungulate's neck in its jaws and foreclaws. Large surface spirals
mark the ungulate's shoulder and haunch, while pebbling lends a
furry texture to the pelt. A pendant ring hangs from the mouth
of each long-necked feline below the ungulate's leg. The back
is flat and displays a button on a stem that projects outward
behind the haunch. Flashing visible in the openings indicates that
the belt hook was piece-mold cast and the precast rings cast on.
No identical garment hook has been found in archaeological
context, but a feline-shaped hook with a chain was discovered
m
, ttiSs
143



in Xietuncun, Ansai county, northern Shaanxi Province, in an
area known to have been inhabited by pastoral peoples. 1 The
complex casting technology required to make belt hooks with
pendant rings and the pebbled surface texture relate such
hooks to personal ornaments that may have been cast at the Jin
state foundry at Houma, southern Shanxi Province. 3 The
smaller creature on the present example is duplicated by the
hook on one of the garment hooks associated with Houma,
further confirmation for this association. 3 It is even possible
that such garment hooks were manufactured by Chinese
craftsmen expressly for trade with their northern pastoral
neighbors.

Belt hook in the shape of a carnivore
Northeast China, ^th-4th century b.c
Bronze
Height 2 in. (g. 1 cm); width 4V2 in. (11 .4 cm)
A standing carnivore shown in profile forms the body of this
small belt hook. Marked by a band of raised chevrons that
extends down the tail and legs, the carnivore has an almond
shaped incised eye, turned-up snout, pointed ear, and a curl
at the base of the jaw. The hook itself emerges from the car
nivore's open mouth and ends in an animal's head. The
reverse has an attachment button with crescent-shaped mold
marks on either side, indicating that the hook was cast inte
grally with the attachment button in a multipiece mold.
Small animal-shaped hooks with similar chevron body
markings have been found at numerous sites in northern
Hebei Province and are associated with the Shanrong hunting
peoples who inhabited the area about the middle of the first
millennium B.C. 1 The blunt way in which the feet terminate
also occurs on Eastern Zhou jade carvings, 2 especially on
examples found in northern Hebei dated to the fourth cen
tury b.c. 3 With its pointed ear, the carnivore is neither a tiger
nor a leopard, but most likely a dog, a popular asset among the
hunting peoples of Northeast China. 4

Belt hook
Central China, ca. cth— 4th century B.C.
Iron inlaid with gold and silver
Length io^ in. (26.8 cm); width 1 A in. (3.2 cm)
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, Joseph Pulitzer
Bequest, 1965 (6c. 170.2)
This unusually large belt hook is made of iron. The sumptu
ous pattern on its broad, arched shaft is composed of seven
square forms and numerous spirals set in gold and silver inlay.
The hook terminates in a small, partially corroded feline head,
and on the back of the shaft is a round stud decorated with
circular designs.
Nearly all large belt hooks with a broad, arched surface
have been found in tombs from the state of Chu in southern
Henan and northern Hubei Provinces. They seem to have
been common in the Chu area during the fifth and fourth cen
turies B.C., after which they gradually went out of use. 1 Belt
hooks of this size are not practical; rather, they are objects
that reflected the wealth and status of the owner, for their
broad surface afforded the artist ample space to display extrav
agant, embellished designs. Among archaeologically recov
ered examples, three iron belt hooks from Xinyang, Henan,
bear the closest resemblance to the present example; they are
almost as large and have an equally luxurious surface inlaid
with gold and silver. 2 ZS

Belt hook in the shape of a monkey
North China, ca. 4th— 3rd century b.c.
Gilded bronze inlaid with turquoise
Height 2/^ in. (6 cm); length 6 in. (ij.2 cm)
Private Collection
The bowed shaft of this bronze belt hook is cast in the form of
a monkey. Balancing its weight on the right arm, the lively
and spirited monkey flexes its legs as it stretches its left arm
and curls its hand to form a hook. Two round staring eyes,
originally filled with semiprecious stone inlays, gaze out
defiantly at the viewer. And thin ribbons and curls of bright
turquoise inlay flow along the torso and limbs, creating an
appealing contrast against the gilded surface . The back of the
hook is also decorated with a curved linear design that is high
lighted with silver. Judging from a comparable example in a
private collection, the monkey may have held a ring, now lost,
in its left hand. 1
A popular motif of late Eastern Zhou and early Western Han
art, the monkey is frequently encountered on decorations in
bronze, and belt hooks with the image of a monkey are rep
resented in both private and public collections. A close exam
ple is the aforementioned belt hook in a private collection,
which is nearly a mirror image of the present hook but with
slightly more curl motifs. Another comparable example is a
silver belt hook excavated at Qufu, Shandong Province, the
site of the ancient capital city of the state of Lu, which dates
to the fourth century B.C. 2 ZS

Feline-shaped belt hook
North China, 4th— 3rd century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 2 in. (4.9 cm); length 4.% in. (1 1 . 1 cm)
Ex coll.: Susan Chen & Company, Hong Kong
This tinned bronze belt hook is cast in the shape of a feline
with its head turned backward. Its body is marked by small
spirals framed by two longitudinal bands of raised dots to sug
gest the textured pelt. A hook terminating in another feline
head projects sideways from the chest. The reverse displays a
protruding button in the middle that shows extensive wear
around the stem. The belt hook has been piece-mold cast and
the front surface tinned.
Hooks that project to the wearer's right, as it does here,
rather than to the left, are unusual. They occur chiefly on
pieces intended for China's northern neighbors, such as those
who inhabited northern Hebei Province during the second half
of the first millennium b.c. 1 The surface markings and tin plat
ing relate the Thaw belt hook to Jin and Qin artifacts, sug
gesting that it may have been made at one of these northern
Warring States metalworking centers expressly for the herd
ing peoples beyond their frontiers. 2

Belt hook with wolf and dzo
Northwest China, 3rd century B.C.
Bronze with traces of gilding
Height 2% in. (7 cm); length 8 in. (20.3 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
This unusual belt hook depicts an animal-combat scene
between a wolf and a dzo. Cast in openwork within a plain
rounded rectangular border, it tapers to a hook, now broken
off, on the wearer's right side. The wolf is shown biting the
dzo in the neck while holding it down by the horn with one
paw. In return, the dzo has pierced the wolf's throat with the
other horn. The wolf has a long muzzle with a sharp fang,
strong clawed paws, and a tail curled between the hind legs,
and the dzo is characterized by a tufted tail and the shaggy fur
on its belly and upper legs. The belt hook is lost- wax cast and
once had mercury gilding, the remains of which are only
faintly visible. Root marks from burial surroundings are
embedded in the corrosion on the back.
In many lower regions where yaks are found, they are often
interbred with the local cattle, resulting in a hybrid known as
a dzo. The hybrids can surpass their parents in strength, are
less stubborn, and can survive in lower altitudes than yaks, all
of which makes them more useful as domesticated animals. 1
148
The way in which the dzo's horn in this plaque pierces the
wolf's throat is similar to that in which a yak pierces the tigers'
cars on a gold belt buckle dated to the third century B.C. that was
excavated at Aluchaideng, Hanggin banner, southwestern Inner
Mongolia. 2 This close association suggests that the Thaw belt
hook and the Aluchaideng plaques are roughly contemporary.
The present example belongs to a group of similar hooks
that all depict animal-combat scenes between a wolf and a
dzo. One is in the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art; 3 another,
in the Stoclet collection, was published by Umehara; 4 and a
third is in the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm. s
All these scenes display similar compositions and use the same
narrative devices, showing the victim with its tongue lolling
out, for example, and the wolf holding down the dzo's horn
with one paw, suggesting that all four plaques may have been
cast at the same foundry.

Hook with hornedfeline
North China, 3rd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Length 4 lA in. (10.8 cm); width 2/4 in. (^.7 cm)
A mask of a fierce-looking horned feline with comma-shaped
ears is represented on the shield of this garment hook. The eyes
and forehead were once embellished with inlay, now missing.
The hook is lost- wax cast and gilded on both sides, and a but
ton protruding from the slightly concave back displays a char
acter or linear design, partially hidden by incrustation.
Garment hooks cast in the shape of animal masks similar
to this one, dated to the third century B.C., are included in
many collections. 1 The comma-shaped ears with a small
sphere at the inside base are stylistic features found on earlier
belt ornaments associated with the pastoral peoples of the
northwestern frontiers, such as catalogue nos. 63 and 94, fur
ther confirming the cultural interaction between the Chinese
and their herding neighbors.

Hook with raptor-headed ungulate

Gilded bronze
Height 1 % in. (4.4 cm); max. width 1
lA in. (3.2 cm)
Ex coll.: J.J. Lally & Co., New York
The body of this coiled, raptor -headed mythological ungulate,
its hind legs slung over its neck, has been ingeniously manip
ulated to fit into a small circular space. The single horn that
sprouts from its head forms the shaft for the actual hook,
which takes the shape of another animal's head. The reverse
is concave and has a wide flat attachment button that was
affixed by soldering after the garment hook was lost- wax cast.
A clay model, similar to an example in the study collection of
the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., was probably
used to form a mother mold for the wax model used in the
final lost- wax casting process. 1 In this way, such artifacts could
be easily mass-produced.
149



A garment hook in the form of a camel, with its body
manipulated in the same way as the ungulate on the Thaw
hook, is in the collection of Therese and Erwin Harris. 2 The
camel's body is marked by the same striated enclosures found
on the bodies of numerous animals represented on artifacts
associated with the China's pastoral neighbors, such as cata
logue nos. 67, 76, 100, 103, and 1^9. The creature on the
Thaw hook is also very similar to the one on a Qi state se string
anchor from Linzi, Shandong Province, which is identical to
catalogue no. 180. Again, these similarities illustrate the cul
tural ebb and flow that must have existed between ancient
China and their herding and hunting neighbors to the north.

Belt hook in the shape of a dragon
North China, 3rd — 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Height 1 % in. (4.4 cm); length 7 /s in. (1 8. 1 cm)
An elongated dragon with a wolflike head twisted into a figure
eight forms the body of this belt hook, and an animal's head
with a long neck extending from the side forms the hook. A
round button on a stem projects from the back for attachment
to a belt. The belt hook was cast by the lost-wax process and
enhanced by mercury gilding, most of which has worn off.
Belt hooks cast in the shape of a figure-eight dragon sim
ilar to the present example are represented in numerous
collections. 1 One hook was collected in Yulin, northern
Shaanxi, indicating that such hooks were produced in the
Xi'an area. 2
Comparison between the dragon on this belt hook and the
wolves on several plaques made for the neighboring pastoral
peoples, such as catalogue nos. 63 and io^, illustrates their
similarities, suggesting that the northern lupine-headed
dragon may well have been part of the ancestry of the Chinese
dragon image which evolved during the Western Han period.
Another pair of northern plaques, catalogue no. 102, was cer
tainly made by Han craftsmen for northern consumption, pro
viding further evidence of Chinese access to and familiarity
with northern zoomorphic motifs.

Published: Hearn 1987, p. 56.
This belt hook takes the form of a serpentine creature with a
round face, a beaked mouth, and enormous pointed ears. The
clawed arms grip the fins that project from its sides, and from
the hind legs extends a straight, tapering shaft that terminates
in a feline-headed hook. Lavish gold and silver inlays arranged
in striated bands, complex geometric patterns, and dense sim
ulated granulation create an unusually ornate surface.
Although fantastic animals and creatures are common dec
orative motifs in late Eastern Zhou and Western Han art,
images closely comparable to the present example are rare. A
gilded bronze figure with similar facial features is in the
Shumei collection in the Miho Museum, Shigaraki. Apparently
a fragment of a larger object, it too has a beaked mouth and
large pointed ears, and a slightly broader face. 1 The pointed
ears are also found on a kneeling figure on a bronze screen
stand that was excavated from the tomb of the king of Nanyue
of the Western Han. 2 The present example was most likely
made in the late years of the Warring States period, since the
rich gold and silver inlays on the surface point to a connec
tion with the sumptuous bronzes reportedly from the Eastern
Zhou royal tombs at Luoyang, Henan Province. ZS

The gold sheathed end of this slender belt hook is modeled
into a large animal head that has an unusually long snout, star
ing eyes, pointed ears, and a ringed horn. The crocodilian
snout is characterized by fluid, wavy lines with sharp, raised
edges. The hook itself, also covered with gold foil, is cast in
the shape of a smaller animal's head, and a round stud is set on
the back of the arched shaft.
A common type during the late Eastern Zhou and Western
Han, belt hooks with a slender shaft, such as this one, are gen
erally made of bronze and often decorated with precious
metal and semiprecious stone inlays. Comparable examples
have been found in Warring States and Han tombs, from the
northeastern coast to deep in the southwestern highland.
While their shapes remain largely the same, their sizes vary
to a considerable degree, the longest being twelve inches and
the shortest merely four to five inches. Belt hooks in silver,
especially those with gold-sheathed embellishment, are rare,
although silver as a metal seems to have become more available
by the Han period. The finest was found in a late Warring
States tomb at Guwei village, Hui county, Henan Province.
Decorated with animal motifs raised in high relief, it is partially
sheathed in gold and inlaid with jade and glass 1 zs

Belt hook in the shape of a warrior and a leopard
North China, 3rd— 1st century B.C.
Gilded bronze inlaid with turquoise
Height 1 i^in. (3.2 cm); width 3 in. (7.6 cm)
Ex coll.: Eskenazi Ltd., London
A warrior with distinctly Mongoloid features is shown fending
off a leopard that sinks its teeth into his side as it grabs him with
both paws. The warrior holds a short sword in his raised right
hand, as if to strike the leopard. He has long hair and wears a
short, belted jacket that fastens on the left. The hook, which
would have taken the form of the warrior's left arm and hand,
is broken off. Lost- wax cast, the hook is inlaid with turquoise to
imitate leopard spots and two-tone gilded on the front and back.
A belt hook that depicts a similar combat between a
Mongoloid warrior and a leopard is in the Danish Museum of
Decorative Art, Copenhagen. 2 The warrior wears the same
apparel as the warrior on the present plaque, a tunic reaching
to the knees, and also has bare legs and feet. His appearance
identifies him an inhabitant of the northern frontier of China
during the last centuries of the first millennium B.C., but his
clothes are not those of a hunter or a mounted warrior
herdsman. Rather, they identify him specifically as a contest
ant in the ritual combats between men and animals staged by
the Chinese emperor to demonstrate the cosmic character of
imperial rule. 3 A late Warring States bronze oil lamp in the
Miho Museum, Shigaraki, is cast in the shape of such a
wrestler dressed in similar attire. 4

Belt hook in the shape of a horned dragon
North China, 3rd — 1st century B.C.
Gilded bronze and glass
Height 1 % in. (4.4 cm); length j% in. (1 8. 1 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
This belt hook takes the form of a serpentine horned dragon.
The hook itself represents an animal's head with a long neck.
Four oval glass inlays adorn the dragon's body, and a small
piece of glass backed by gilding marks the eye. The belt hook
was piece-mold cast and the button on the back soldered on.
Examples of this type of hook are included in many col
lections. 1 The interesting feature here is the use of glass for
inlay, a new practice that appeared in China during the late
Eastern Zhou and Han periods. 2 Early glass eyebeads made in
the west have been found in many burials associated with the
pastoral peoples, who may have participated in their trans
mission eastward across the Eurasian steppes. The inlays on the
present hook are not actual eyebeads but probably glass ovals
with stems designed to fit into sockets, such as the inlays with
eye designs that adorn a belt hook in the Miho Museum,
Shigaraki. 3

Belt hook with dragons
North China, 2nd century B.C.
Gilded bronze
Length 6% in. (16 cm); width i Vi in. (3.8 cm)
Two entwined dragonlike creatures are represented on the
body of this belt hook, and an animal's head on a long neck or
shaft extends from the wearer's left side to form the hook
itself. The hook is mercury gilded on both sides, and the eye
of the smaller dragon appears to be inlaid with some type of
stone. The reverse is flat and has a button on a stem.
Western Han tombs for the elite abound with richly
adorned belt hooks, such as the example seen here. Chinese
garment hooks were luxury items designed for show and pres
tige; they were not intended to indicate clan and rank, as were
the belt ornaments of the northern pastoral peoples.
During the Eastern Han dynasty (a.d. 2j — 220), belt hooks
declined in popularity, and they were not listed as an appro
priate accoutrement in an official edict of a.d. ^9." By the
Western Jin (a.d. 26^ — 317), elaborate belt hooks had gone
out of fashion altogether and were replaced by sectioned belts
formed by a series of plaques with a matching buckle. 2

5. GARMENT PLAQUES
The majority of these artifacts served the same purpose as belt
buckles, visually reinforcing the power and prestige of their
owners. Some plaques functioned as additional belt orna
ments, and some were appliqued on clothing. A hierarchy of
metals, gold, silver, gilded bronze, tinned bronze, and plain
bronze proclaimed the status of the wearer. A reconstruction
of the lavishly decorated clothing of an elite male buried at
Issyk-Kul, near Almaty, in Kazakhstan, suggests how such
plaques may have been worn (see fig. C4).
r 33Bird-shaped garment plaque
Northeast China, 8th— 7th century b.c
Bronze
Height 1 % in. (4. 1 cm); width 1 A in. (4.4 cm)
Ex coll. : Michael Dunn, New York
This small garment plaque takes the form of a bird with out
spread wings and prominent claws. Raised striations suggest
feathers on the wings and tail, and raised chevrons mark the
long neck. A vertical loop for attachment is placed behind the
head on the reverse, and a mold mark that runs along the
length of the loop and down the back indicates that the loop
was cast integrally with the plaque in a multipiece mold.
Two bird-shaped ornaments similar to the present one
were discovered in Northeast China at Zhoujiadi, Aohan ban
ner, southeastern Inner Mongolia, a site that has been dated
from the eighth to the seventh century B.C. 1 two more were
excavated at Nanshan'gen, Ningcheng county, southeastern
Inner Mongolia, another eighth-to- seventh- century b.c. site. 2
The bird on this plaque is very similar to a bird depicted on a
mirror excavated at Shangcunling, near Sanmenxia, Henan, a
site dated from the late Western Zhou to the early Spring and
Autumn period, about the eighth century b.c. 3 The
Shangcunling mirror was not made in China but appears to be
an exotic object acquired from farther north or northeast, pre
sumably through trade. 4
The bird that constitutes the present plaque, the excavated
examples, and the bird on the Shangcunling mirror all have
unusually long necks. This feature suggests that the bird por
trayed is a vulture, a bird of prey and scavenger common to
Northeast China and the Eurasian steppes.

Pair of tiger-shaped plaques
Northeast China, 7th- 6th century b.c.
Bronze
Each: Height 1 /$ in. (3.5 cm); width 1 A in. (4.4 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
Each of these two mirror-image plaques is cast in the shape of
a crouching tiger with its tail terminating in a stylized raptor's
head. The body, tail, and legs are marked by raised diagonal
ridges. A ribbed, rounded triangle accentuates the tigers'
shoulders, and a concentric oval, the haunches. The eyes of
both the tigers' and the birds' heads are round and perforated,
and each tiger's mouth is indicated by an indented X-shape.
The reverse of each plaque is flat and has two vertical loops for
attachment that have been soldered on. Flashing in the open
ings indicates that each of the ornaments was cast in a two
piece mold.
Several plaques excavated at Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng
county, southeastern Inner Mongolia, have body markings and
perforated eyes similar to those seen here. 1 One Xiaoheishigou
tiger-shaped plaque also has an X-shaped mouth. 2 The
Xiaoheishigou burials have been redated here from the sev
enth to the sixth century B.C. 3 The body markings and raptor
headed tails relate these plaques to catalogue nos. 26 and 27,
harness jingles of the same period.

Set of twenty ornamental plaques
Northeast China, 6th century B.C.
Bronze
Average height 1 34 in. (3.1 cm); width 1 /4 in. (4.3 cm)
Lent by Shelby White and Leon Levy
Published: So and Bunker 1995, pp. 160—61, no. 83.
These twenty bronze deer once served as personal ornaments
for one of the pastoral peoples inhabiting the Dongbei
(Northeast China) about 600 B.C. Each deer is shown in
profile, with its legs folded in such a way that the forelegs
overlap the hind legs and with the hooves indicated by pierced
circles. The antlers have been transformed into a series of tan
gent circles that terminate in a strut attached to the deer's
hindquarters. Each plaque has a long horizontal loop on the
back extending from the chest to the rump for attachment and
appears to have been mass-produced by piece-mold casting.
The pose in which the deer are shown is characteristic of
that which developed throughout the Eurasian steppes during
the first half of the first millennium B.C. 1 Similar images of
deer have been found in various frontier regions east of the
Taihang Mountains, but never in northern regions west of the
Taihang. An attribution of such images to the Ordos region
ir8



was made by art dealers in Beijing in the i 920s, 2 but in fact
deer images produced in the Ordos seldom have horns and
are shown recumbent, whereas the Dongbei figures are shown
with horns and in motion (see cat. no. 3 c). Excavations made
during the last decade, in northern Hebei Province and the
Dongbei, have provided a more accurate provenience for
such motifs. Burials dating to about the sixth century B.C. at
Ganzibao, Huailai county, northern Hebei, have revealed
graves in which the dead were literally covered with animal
shaped ornaments, just as they were at related sites at
Jundushan, Yanqing county, north of Beijing. 3 Deer with
folded legs and with their antlers transformed into a series of
tangent circles have also been found in tomb 3, at Ganzibao. 4
Five similar gold deer in the Carl Kempe collection in
Stockholm reinforce the observation that status was partially
expressed by the choice of metal from which personal orna
ments were cast^

Deer-shaped garment plaque
Pamir Mountains, Kazakhstan, 6th- fth century B.C.
Bronze
Height 3 in. (7.6 cm); width 3^4 in. (9.^ cm)
Ex coll.: Ward & Company, Inc., New York
This elegant garment plaque is cast in the form of a mytho
logical deer with raptor-headed antler tines and folded legs.
The body, from which two buttons project, is concave on the
reverse, and the horns are flat. The plaque was cast by the lost
wax process, but the wax model may have been mold made.
Garment plaques in the shape of mythological deer with
two attachment buttons on the reverse have been found
among grave goods from Saka burials in the Tamdinskii ceme
tery, tentatively dated from the sixth to the fourth century B.C.
in the Pamir Mountains of Central Asia. 1 A pointed muzzle
similar to that of the present deer appears to be a characteris
tic specific to the Saka ungulate figures of the eastern Pamirs. 2
The presence of brow tines indicates that the deer is based on
a reindeer image that must have remained in the collective
memory of the Saka, since reindeer never lived as far south as
the Pamirs.
The transformation of horns and antler tines into raptors'
heads is an iconographic phenomenon that first developed
1 59



among the pastoral peoples during the first millennium B.C.
The earliest known example of this image was discovered in
a seventh-to-sixth-century B.C. Saka grave at Chilikta, in east
ern Kazakhstan, 3 and from there transmitted west to the Black
Sea area and ultimately eastward to southern Siberia and the
borders of Northwest China. 4

Garment plaque with two raptors
Kazakhstan, 6th— rth century B.C.
Bronze
Height 1 % in. (4. 1 cm); width 1
3A in. (4.4 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
Two raptors swirl around a central circle on this small plaque.
Such raptor images are based on the eagle, a predator that
threatened the herds, was used in falconry, and was credited
with magical powers. The plaque is flat on the reverse and has
a projecting button on a stem that shows considerable wear.
The piece is lost- wax cast.
A similar design, which adorns a wooden roundel from
Tuekta, kurgan 1 , in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia, is
dated to the sixth century b.c. , ' suggesting a common ancestry
160
for the motif in the distant past. The only difference between
the raptors on the present plaque and those on the Tuekta
roundel are the eyes, which on the former are naturalistically
round, as birds' eyes should be, while on the latter they are
almond-shaped, like those of the mythological griffin.

Garment plaque in the shape of a coiled panther
Eastern Kazakhstan, 6th— ^th century B.C.
Bronze
Diameter 2 % in. (6 . 7 cm)
Ex coll.: Ward & Company, Inc., New York
Shaped as a stylized coiled panther, this plaque has two attach
ment buttons on stems on the reverse and a loop formed by
the tail tip touching the tiger's haunch. Considerable wear
marks are visible on the loop, which appears to have been
rubbed by a leather strap, and the panther has a scooped-out
back with a thick outside edge. The plaque appears to have
been lost-wax cast.
Coiled panthers are a characteristic motif of the Saka people
and have been found at several Saka sites in eastern Kazakhstan,
among them the Uigarak cemetery 1 and the Saka-Charga Hills
burials, 2 both situated south and east of the Aral Sea. Other
sites in Kazakhstan include the Chilikta burial ground, dated
from the seventh to the sixth century b.c. 3



The Saka coiled-panther motif is a slightly later version of
the coiled carnivores represented on steppe ornaments, such
as the paws of a seventh-century B.C. gold panther from
Kelermes, in the Black Sea region 4 and a seventh-to-sixth
century b.c. harness breastplate from Arzhan, in Tuva, south
ern Siberia (fig. 34).

Garment plaque with kulan
Northern Hebei Province, 6th— cth century B.C.
Bronze
Height 1% in. (4,8 cm); width 1 Vs in. (2.9 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
Two pairs of kulan protomes with heads turned back and both
ears shown are enclosed within a rectangular frame on this open
work plaque. Each pair features only the forequarters, as if the
first animal overlapped the adjacent animal that in turn is over
lapped by the frame. The round eyes are each surrounded by a
circular ridge, and slight depressions mark the ears, nostrils, and
mouth. The reverse of the plaque is slightly concave and has no
attachment devices, suggesting that it was affixed through the
openings in the design. Mold marks around the edge of the frame
indicate casting in a two-piece mold.
A small ornament decorated with the same kulan protome
was recently excavated from tomb 3 at Ganzibao, Huailai
county, northern Hebei Province, with other artifacts tenta
tively dated from the sixth to the fifth century B.C. 1 Another
plaque similar to the present example was collected in

Garment plaque in the shape of a raptor's head
North China and south-central Inner Mongolia, 6th
^th century B.C.
Bronze
Height A in. (2.2 cm); width 1 in. (2.^ cm)
Ex coll.: Calon da Collection
A prominent curved beak, round eye, and tiny round ear char
acterize the stylized raptor's head that constitutes this gar
ment plaque. The eye is indicated by a wide circular groove
surrounding the pupil, and sunken areas mark the beak and
ear. The reverse of the plaque is flat and displays a vertical
rounded loop that was piece-mold cast integrally with the
plaque. Mold marks are visible around the base of the loop.
Small garment ornaments similar to this one abound in
Liangcheng county, south-central Inner Mongolia, especially
at Maoqinggou 1 and Guoxianyaozi, 2 in graves dating to
between the sixth and the fourth century b.c. Another exam
ple was found in a fifth-century b.c. grave at Xigoupan, Jungar
banner, in the Ordos Desert region of Northwest China and
southwestern Inner Mongolia. 3
The entire plaque is a representation of the head alone, and
the design is made by a pattern integrated into rather than
161



superimposed on the anatomical form. These are both fea
tures characteristic of Chinese birds' heads seen on Western
Zhou chariotry equipment, and they became popular through
out the Eurasian steppes during the first millennium b.c. 4
Stylized birds' heads are also represented on wood carving in
the Altai region of southern Siberia (fig. 30).
It is possible that ancient bird's-head designs were carried
from southern Siberia by the Scythians, after which they
moved into northwestern Asia in the seventh century B.C.
Such designs first appear in Northwest Asia together with the
coiled feline, another eastern motif, on material from the
seventh-century B.C. Ziwiye hoard found in northwestern
Iran. ? These birds' heads should not be confused with griffins'
heads, which have almond-shaped animal eyes and can be
traced back through the Pontic steppes to the Hellenic world
and ultimatelv to the ancient Near East. 6

Bronze
Height 2 in. (4.9 cm); width 1 A in. (4.4 cm)
Ex coll.: Emma C. Bunker
A medley of four stylized raptors' heads that together form
one large head adorn this garment plaque. The heads are all
similar to that on catalogue no. 140 and cast in the same
style. And like catalogue no. 140, the reverse of the present
plaque displays two heavy vertical loops. It was cast in a multi
piece mold.
Although no exact duplicate has been excavated, there is
no doubt that the plaque shares the same style and was made
in the same geographic region as the other south-central Inner
Mongolian examples in the Thaw collection (cat. nos. 59,
140). The smooth surface has a dark, shiny tin-oxide patina,
indicating that the alloy is a high-tin leaded bronze.

that was identified as a high-tin leaded bronze by X-ray fluorescence.

Deer-shaped garment plaque
Pamir Mountains, Kazakhstan, 6th— 4th century B.c.
Bronze
Height 2 in. (5.2 cm); width 2% in. (^.7 cm)

This garment plaque is cast in the shape of deer with flowing
antlers and folded legs. Like catalogue no. 146, the eye, shoul
der, and haunch are marked by round depressions. The
reverse is flat and displays two buttons on stems; and the
plaque is lost-wax cast.
162



The deer has the same pointed muzzle and round body
markings as those on catalogue no. 1 36, both stylistic charac
teristics seen on Saka artifacts excavated in the Pamirs. 1 The
rounded loop of the front leg is also a stylistic trait found on
such plaques (cat. nos. 136, 144—146).
r. Litvinskii 1984, p. 53, fig. 12:6,14.
This plaque depicts a deer with flowing antlers and folded
legs. The reverse is flat with two stemmed buttons. Although
similar to the other deer plaques associated with the Pamir
Saka in the Thaw collection, the image here is less stylized,
with more naturalistically rendered antlers and a less pointed
muzzle, suggesting that it may be slightly earlier in date. In
other respects, such as the attachment buttons and the method
of casting, it is quite similar and must come from, the same
general area.

Each of these small garment plaques comprises two deer pro
tomes joined at the midsection. Each deer has an extended
muzzle. The presence of brow tines indicates that the images
are based on the reindeer, suggesting that the original home
land of the Pamir Saka may have been far to the north. Because
both male and female reindeer have antlers, it would be risky
to identify these deer as stags. A large button on a. stem proj
ects from the concave back of each ornament. The two
plaques were lost-wax cast.

While no similar plaques have been published in scientific
excavation reports, the present examples are stylistically and
technically similar to the other Pamir Saka plaques in the

Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
This garment plaque is cast in the form of a Przewalski horse,
the wild Asian horse that roamed the Eurasian steppes in
ancient times. Sandy beige in color, it has a short black upright
mane and short legs. The shoulder, haunch, and eye are each
marked by a round depression, but such marks were not
intended for inlay. The back of the ornament is concave, with
a rim that turns inward and an attachment button on a bent
stem behind the horse's midsection. The plaque was cast by
the lost- wax process and displays extensive wear.
Although no identical plaques have been published from a
controlled excavation, this horse-shaped example relates sty
listically to catalogue no. 142. Both animals have slightly
pointed muzzles, typical of Saka artifacts found in the Pamirs,
and presumably can also be dated from the sixth to the fifth
century B.C. Several plaques similar to the present horse
shaped ornament have appeared on the art market in the last
five years and were attributed to the Pamir Saka. 1

Leopard-shaped garment plaque
Northwest China, 5th century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height i/s in. (3.^ cm); width 2/4 in. (7 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
Published: So and Bunker 199c, p. 113, no. 28.
This tinned-bronze plaque is cast in the shape of a standing
leopard in profile with only two legs showing. The pelt is indi
cated by striated circles of sunken line relief, and indented
diagonal lines mark the tail. The ear is formed by a spiral that
begins at the interior. The leopard's fierceness is accentuated
by open jaws revealing pointed fangs and teeth and two paws
that display four prominent claws. The back of the ornament
has a smooth concave surface with a small round vertical
attachment loop at the midsection, and the front has a silvery
looking surface produced by wiping with molten tin." The
plaque is lost-wax cast, and the openings in the design appear
to have been cut through a wax model from the front.
The ornament displays an intriguing combination of north
ern and Chinese characteristics. The indented, striated circles
are associated with the Jin state foundry at Houma, in south
ern Shanxi Province, which produced animal motifs and
animal-shaped vessels that also carry striated circle decora
tion. 2 The emphasis on sharp fangs and claws is a northern
characteristic that derives ultimately from the wood-carving
traditions of southern Siberia, exemplified by the tigers carved
on a sixth-century B.C. wooden coffin from Bashadar, in the
Altai Mountains (fig. 32).

This small plaque takes the form of a standing wild boar with

mold marks are visible at the base of the loop ends and along
the edges, indicating piece -mold casting.
No similar plaques have been found in archaeological con
text, but a nearly identical example was collected in the early

no. 148. The animals' heads at each end have round conven
tionalized eyes, while the boar's eye has a more naturalistic
almond shape. The carnivores' paws each display four claws.
The reverse of the plaque has pronounced hollows and a ver
tical attachment strap at the top, behind one of the carnivore's
heads. Mold marks are visible along the edges.
Several ornaments similar to this one are included in the
Arthur M. Sackler collections. 1 Plaques of this type often
include tiny hedgehogs among the animal motifs. 2 These
images were often represented on artifacts of the pastoral peo
ples in northern Shaanxi Province and the Ordos Desert
region, where one species of hedgehog flourished. 3

Garment plaque with leopard and hear
Northwest China, jth— 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 2^4 in. (c.7 cm); width 2 Kin. (c.6 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This plaque depicts a coiled leopard with slightly open jaws
menacing a small bear. The eyes of both animals are repre
sented by intaglio circles and the ears by small depressions
within rounded rims. The leopard's claws are marked by
indented lines, and the tail is textured by diagonals. The
reverse of the plaque is slightly concave and displays two small
vertical loops at the midsection, one at each edge. Flashing in
the openings suggests that the object was piece-mold cast.
A plaque with an almost identical design was excavated at
Dabeishan, Yanglang, in Guyuan county, southern Ningxia.
The animals have been described as a mother leopard and her
cub, 1 but the short tail and long muzzle are characteristic of a
bear rather than a leopard. The paws are represented in a style
that may ultimately derive from styles prevalent in the
Minusinsk region of southern Siberia. 2

Bronze
Height 1 Vi in. (3.8 cm); width 1 % in. (3.5- in.)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Lord Cunliffe
Collection; Calon da Collection
Published: Rawson and Bunker 1990, no. 209.
This small flat plaque represents an ibex with a suckling kid.
The eye is marked by a circular ridge with an interior depres
sion, a conventional treatment found on many representations
of animals associated with the pastoral peoples. There are two
tiny attachment loops, a vertical one beneath the kid and a
horizontal one between the ibex's neck and horn. The plaque
is flat on both the front and back and was cast in an open mold
that resulted in minimal flashing.
The ibex can be readily identified by the regular anterior
ridges that mark the length of the horn. Ibex have physical
attributes that enable them to thrive in mountainous regions,
such as those which exist in northern Hebei Province, where
examples of this plaque have been found in Luanping county. 1
Such plaques have also been discovered in the Manhan
Mountains in Liangcheng county, south-central Inner
Mongolia. 2 Another example was found far to the west, in the
Hanqigou cemetery, near Hami, in Xinjiang, where it was
probably carried through trade 3

This gold openwork Xianbei plaque, which is very similar in
design to catalogue no. 1 ^4, depicts three standing stags with
their heads turned back toward their hindquarters. The stags'
bodies are concave on the reverse, while the rest of the
design is flat. The plaque was cast by the lost-wax process,
the openings in the wax model having been cut through from
the front.

Numerous Xianbei ornaments that carry this design have
been found throughout North China. A very handsome gold
example comes from a burial at Jingtan, Qahar Youyi Hou
banner, Ulanqab league, southeastern Inner Mongolia. 1 Some
examples are cast in gold; some in bronze covered with thin
gold sheet, such as catalogue no. i C4; and others are in plain
bronze, depending on the status of the owner.

Garment plaque in the shape of two horses
North China, 1st— 3rd century a. d.
Bronze
Height 1 A in. (4. 1 cm); width 2% in. (^.9 cm)
Ex coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This plaque is cast in the shape of a small horse on top of a larger
horse. The bottom horse's folded legs are so abstracted that
they form a straight line. The reverse of the plaque is slightly
concave and carries no loops. The plaque is lost- wax cast.
Plaques cast in similar shapes depicting horses have been
found throughout North China and are associated with the
Xianbei people. 1 The Xianbei were among the Donghu peo
ple conquered by the Xiongnu during the formation of their
extensive empire in the late third century b.c. By the first cen
tury a.d. , the Xianbei had succeeded the Xiongnu as the dom
inant pastoral people on China's northern frontier.
Plaques in the shape of a large horse surmounted by a
smaller horse appear to have been one of the Xianbei' s most
distinctive visual motifs. Similar examples have been exca
vated at a Xianbei cemetery in Houbaoshi, Da'an, Jilin. 2
Those found in Qinghai Province with geometric designs on
the body and with recognizable Xianbei decoration are later in
date 3 and can be associated with a breakaway Xianbei group
better known as the Tuyuhun. 4
A less stylized version of this design on a plaque cast in gold
was excavated in Horqin Zuoyi Zhong banner, Jirem league,
Inner Mongolia, and shows how the legs of the bottom horse
were originally depicted before they were abstracted into a
straight line s The legs on the gold example are folded under
the horse but do not overlap, as they do on catalogue nos. 3 2
and 13 c. This folded-leg pose is quite different from that of
the recumbent ungulates portrayed in earlier artifacts made
in North China.

Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
Three standing stags within a stylized ropelike border are rep
resented on this openwork Xianbei plaque. The area above
the stags' heads suggests vegetation, continuing a scheme used
on earlier ornaments cast for the Xiongnu. The plaque is lost
wax cast and wrapped with gold sheet. On the reverse, the stags'
bodies are seen to be concave, like those on catalogue no. 117.
Similar ornaments depicting stags in an openwork design
have been found throughout Northeast China, in areas con
trolled by the Xianbei. 1 Although the designs on many Xianbei
plaques became increasingly abstracted, the message they
imparted was understood as well as if the scene had been more
easily recognizable. 2
Mercury gilding was seldom used by the Xianbei, who
gilded their artifacts by applying gold sheet to the bronze sur
face. A gold version of the present design was excavated at
Sandaowan, Qahar Youyi Hou banner, Ulanqab league, south
eastern Inner Mongolia. 3

6. PERSONAL ORNAMENTS
Personal ornaments included in this section are pectorals, shoe
buckles, amulets, circular plaques, and one bone bead. The
pectorals were as important as belt decorations among the
pastoral peoples of northern Hebei and the Dongbei. For the
ancient Chinese, nephrite (jade) was the symbol of excellence
long before the introduction of metal. The initial inspiration
to wear metal next to the skin had priority among ancient
China's pastoral neighbors, but the custom was soon adopted
in nuclear China and became a major indication of status and
rank by the first millennium a.d.
l 55Kulan-shaped pectoral
Northeast China, 6th century b.c.
Gold
Height 2% in. (6.7 cm); width 3% in. (8.4 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
This gold plaque, in the form of a standing male kulan,
signified the status of the owner who wore it as an emblem
on his chest. The kulan is shown in profile with only two legs
but both ears depicted, and the mane is represented by raised
striations. The overly large ears and tassel at the end of the
tail confirm its identity. Two vertical V-shaped loops for
attachment are placed on the reverse, one behind the muzzle
and the other behind the haunch. The plaque has rather jagged
edges and appears to have been cast in a two-piece mold. It has
not been overly cleaned and still retains a bit of red cinnabar
on the head from burial rituals. The tail appears to have been
reattached in antiquity, as it is not a recent mend.
The wild ass roamed over a good part of North China and
beyond in ancient times. The prominent emphasis on sexuality
associates this ornament with the hunting cultures of Northeast
China, where genitals were frequently depicted in representa
tions of both humans and animals. One of the tombs unearthed
in 1963 at Nanshan'gen, Ningcheng county, yielded two bronze
ladles with handles in the shape of male genitals. 1 They are also
displayed on a bronze stag unearthed at Longtoushan , Hexigten
banner, southeastern Inner Mongolia, as is the unusual combi
nation of only two legs but both ears in profile. 2 Gold appears
to have been far more popular among the peoples of Northeast
China during the earlier part of the first millennium b.c. than
it was among the pastoral groups inhabiting the northern grass
lands west of the Taihang Mountains.
Hunting was a major factor in the local economy of the
pastoral peoples of Northeast China and the adjacent area of
southeastern Inner Mongolia, 3 and the need for visual sym
bols of fertility to assure the proliferation of wild game may
explain the widespread representation of this pronounced sex
ual image. Scenes of wild animals copulating were also popu
lar subjects on grave goods found in Northeast China.

same purpose, serving a function that is consistent with the
wear patterns on the loops.

This handsome gold pectoral represents a standing horse in
profile. Perforations mark the eye, shoulder, and haunch, as
well as the nostril, ear, and mouth. The mane is notched and
protrudes from the surface. Red powder, probably cinnabar,
can be seen in crevices both on the front and back of the plaque,
which also displays two small vertical loops along the top edge.
A clear wear pattern on the loops suggests that a cord was
passed through both loops, running through two notches worn
into the top rim and then farther upward around the owner's
neck, to form a V-shape. The loops were integrally cast with
the plaque by the lost-wax process.
The horse shown here is a Przewalski, identifiable by the
upright mane and fringed tail. 1 Horses played a major role in

Height 1 % in. (4.4 cm); width \/t in. (10.5 cm)
Ex coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
This gold pectoral takes the form of a crouching leopard shown
in profile. Turquoise inlays once marked the tail tip, shoulder,
haunch, paws, eye, and mouth, but only two inlays now
remain. A short strut between the tail and hind leg acts as a sup
port. The reverse is hollow and displays two vertical attach
ment loops, one behind the neck and the other behind the
171



haunch. The plaque is lost-wax cast. The back leg and tail were
previously broken off; they have recently been reattached.
Several gold plaques very similar in shape and design to
this one have been found in Tang county, northern Hebei
Province. 1 Another superb gold example was discovered in a
male burial at Yuhuangmiao, Jundushan, Yanqing county,
Beijing, worn high on the chest as a pectoral to indicate
clan and rank. 2 The use of gold proclaimed the wearer's sta
tus, which was higher than that of someone with a plain
bronze pectoral.

Deer amulet
Northeast China, 5th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 1/8 in. (3.C cm); width i A in. (3.2 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York; Calon da Collection
This amulet takes the form of a deer with folded legs and
abstracted antlers surmounted on a short twisted shaft with an
attachment loop. Both the antlers, a series of three tangent
circles and ribbed to suggest texture, and the eye, rendered by
a raised circle with an indented center, are conceived as highly
stylized, a characteristic feature of Eurasian steppe art. A mold
mark along the edges and in the openings indicates that the
amulet was cast in a two-piece mold.
No amulets of this type have been found archaeologically,
but numerous collected — rather than excavated — examples
are included in the collections of the Inner Mongolia Museum,
Hohhot, and the Arthur M. Sackler collections. 1 A set of
twenty plaques in the Shelby White and Leon Levy collection
(cat. no. 1 3 r), each in the shape of a deer similar to the pres
ent one, has been dated to the sixth century B.C. and associated
stylistically with the art of Northeast China. 2 Similar deer
shaped plaques, but no amulets, have also been excavated at
Ganzibao, Huailai county, north of Beijing. 3 The White-Levy
deer and the Ganzibao deer have the same stylized antlers rep
resented by tangent circles, a feature that also occurs on the
deer-shaped harness jingle in the Thaw collection (cat. no. 29).
The stag's pose, in which the legs overlap, is a characteris
tic leg position for representing ungulates that had developed
throughout the Eurasian steppes by the early first millen
nium B.C. 4 Such a pose can be seen on many deerstones found
throughout southern Siberia and Mongolia 5 and on the seventh
century b.c. gold belt fragment from the Ziwiye hoard, from
northern Iran (cat. no. r 68).

Height 1 A in. (4.4 cm); diameter A in. (1 .6 cm)
Ex coll.: Anthony Hardy; Calon da Collection
Published: So and Bunker 1995, p. 138, fig. j6.i.
This small carved bone cylinder is decorated with a mytholog
ical ungulate with an eared, raptor-headed tail flanked by two
striated bands. The ungulate has a rapacious beak rather than a
muzzle, its hindquarters are twisted 180 degrees, and carved
striated enclosures give texture to the body. Such features may
have originated in stamped leatherwork and in wood and bone
carving, surface markings that were then translated into bronze
on belt plaques such as catalogue no. 63.
172



To date, no identical objects have been excavated archae
ologically, but the raptor-headed appendage relates the image
to certain mythological creatures represented on the tattooed
man from Pazyryk, kurgan 2 (fig. 37). Surface patterns that
are similar also embellish belt plaques cast during the second
and first centuries B.C. , as can be seen on numerous examples
in the Thaw collection (see, for example, cat. nos. 99, 100).

A fantastic creature with a beak, long ear, cloven front hoof,

coiled to fit within a thick, ropelike frame on this circular
gilded-bronze ornament. One of three curved hooks projects
from the edge of the ornament; the other two have broken
off. A small attachment loop is located in the center of the
concave underside. The ornament is cast by the lost-wax

173



Fantastic, composite animals with twisted hindquarters
appeared in the art of the steppes around the middle of the first
millennium b.c. Creatures with twisted hindquarters are seen
on a carved wooden sixth-century B.C. coffin from Bashadar in
the Altai Mountains (fig. 32) and later were represented on arti
facts belonging to the pastoral peoples bordering Northwest
China, such as catalogue nos. 63 and 94. The elegance of the
present ornament represents a characteristic steppe motif that
has been Sinicized to suit the exotic princely tastes of the
Western Han elite. The plaque may also have served as a xian
grui, a symbol of auspicious portent in Han culture 1

Pair of buckles with recumbent boars

Gold inlaid with glass and turquoise
Each: Height 1 % in. (3.1 cm); width 1 % in. (4.^ cm)
Lent by Shelby White and Leon Levy
Ex coll.: von Bothmer 1990, pp. 63 — 64., no. 46.
A recumbent boar in high relief is represented on each of these
gold buckles. The boar is shown with a hind leg overlapping
one foreleg, while the other foreleg extends forward. A heart
shaped inlay cell, now empty, is placed behind each animal.
The hooves, shoulder, and rump are distinguished by inlays,
mostly turquoise, while glass inlays that are badly crizzled
mark the eyes and ears
The buckles were formed by hammering sheet gold into a
matrix from the back, and the details were made by chasing on
the front of each buckle. On the reverse, at the end opposite the
hook, is a silver loop attached by solder. A small upright pin,
visible on the underside, has been inserted just in front of
the oblong opening to serve as the hook with which to fas
ten the buckle. The plaques are essentially mirror images with
minor differences, which suggests that they may have been
made at the same time in the same workshop but by two
different goldsmiths. 1
No buckles similar to the White-Levy buckles have yet
been discovered, but several Sarmatian ornaments display sty
listic characteristics similar to those on the buckles . Only one
hind leg and both forelegs of each boar are depicted, a typical
artistic convention present in Sarmatian art of the first cen
tury b.c. For example, a gold belt plaque from the Rostov
region, east of the Black Sea, depicts deer with only one hind
leg but both forelegs. 2 The deer on the Rostov belt plaque are
shown in profile like the boars on the White-Levy buckles,
but, like the boars, the deer are shown with two ears. On both
the Rostov plaque and the buckles the animals' hooves are
174



identified by tear-shaped inlays. The dot-and-comma motif on
the hindquarters of each boar is another Sarmatian trait and
distinguishes the animal depicted on a gold belt buckle exca
vated in the Volgograd region. 3
The two White-Levy buckles may have been intended to
be shoe buckles, like catalogue no. 163, which has a similar
fastening hook. The fact that each plaque has a hook precludes
their being part of the same buckle, as each is made to func
tion separately. On the basis of the stylistic and technical sim
ilarities, the two buckles can be tentatively attributed to the
Sarmatians, the major horse-riding people who succeeded
the Scythians as masters of the western Eurasian steppes by the
second century B.C.
1 . For a more detailed technical and stylistic analysis, see Karen
Rubinson's excellent entry in von Bothmer 1 990, pp. 63 — 64, no. 46.

This heavy gold buckle takes the form of a recumbent ram
whose frontal head with arching horns is placed in the center
of a profile body. Tool marks are still visible on the reverse,
where the wax used to form the model was pushed into the
mold. The back once had loops, now missing. A button for
fastening purposes, above the ram's head, was positioned by
being pushed through a perforation, and is still movable. The
turquoise inlays appear to be original. There are several mends
to the gold visible from the back that were done in antiquity.
The buckle is cast by lost wax.
Small gold buckles similar in type have been excavated
at Tillyatepe, in what was ancient Bactria, a site located in
present-day Afghanistan. 1 The site was occupied by pastoral
peoples who had fled western China after their defeat by the
Xiongnu in the second century B.C. The present plaque was
originally one of a matched pair of shoe buckles, similar to a
pair excavated at Tillyatepe. Even the tips of the ram's horns
turn up at the ends the same way as they do on the Tillyatepe
artifacts, which date from the first century B.C. to the first
century a.d. 2

MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, AND
CEREMONIAL PARAPHERNALIA
Section seven includes mirrors, tools for tuning and tighten
ing strings on musical instruments, and a few objects whose
functions have not yet been determined. Many of these, such
as the tools for musical instruments, are considered traditional
Chinese objects. However, the decoration frequently reflects
a northern stylistic element. The presence of mountain forms
on one example (cat. no. 179) suggests that three-dimensional
landscape representation in early Han and later Chinese paint
ing may have been inspired, in part, through contact with the
steppe world.

Implement with curved blade
North China, ca. 1 3th— 1 ith century B.C.
Bronze
Length 1 2 A in. (3 1 . 1 cm)
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, Fletcher Fund,
1923 (23.226.6)
Published: So and Bunker 199J, pp. 99—100, no. 13.
This implement has a slender, blunt blade that broadens to a
rounded end. The handle, separated from the blade by a double
spiraled guard, terminates in a playful-looking animal's head
with goggly eyes and a moveable tongue in an open mouth.
The creature's flat body merges with the shaft of the handle,
while its pointed tail extends into the ridge of the blade. A
rectangular opening pierces through the shaft near the guard.
Several similar implements have been found on the north
ern frontiers of China, where the Shang had frequent contact
with the nomadic cultures. The example excavated at
Gaocheng, Hebei Province, is similar in design but decorated
on the handle with an ibex. 1 Three other examples, found in
Shanxi Province—two at Shilou and one at Suide—have the
same animal's head with a moveable tongue on the handle. 2
Among the three, the two from Shilou have a hollow handle
with an openwork design that was once inlaid with turquoise. i
1 76



The function of this implement remains unknown. Chinese
archaeologists generally refer to it as a bi, implying that they
regard it as a utensil for scooping up food, but its shape differs
so significantly from that of bi found at late Shang sites that it
could not possibly have served the same function. Moreover,
the blade is too narrow to scoop up food effectively. It has
also been suggested that the implement served as a wand for
a shaman, but there is no evidence to support this argument, 4
and we have yet to look to future discoveries for help in solv
ing this puzzle. ZS

Ornament with six bells
North China, early first millennium B.C.
Bronze
Length 6/s in. (17.5 cm)
{Catherine and George Fan
This ornament is formed by two hollow tubes placed parallel
to each other and joined by two struts, one near each end.
Both the tubes and the three bells suspended from loops on
the outer sides are embellished with a medley of designs based
on triangles, zigzags, and hatched lines. Each bell is crudely
cast in the shape of a cone, with four triangular perforations
and a clapper. The clapper of each bell was cast first, then the
bell, and finally all six bells were placed in the mold and the
double-tube object cast onto them. 1
Small bells with clappers, frequently suspended from the
underside of vessels or associated with horse and chariot
equipment, have been found at numerous northern sites
dating to the late second and early first millennium b.c. 2
*77



Noisemakers that jingled when the objects to which they were
attached were moved figure prominently in cultures in which
shamanism played a major role. They are unrelated to the
development of Chinese musical bells, which were actually
percussion instruments played by striking specific areas on the
bells rather than by moving them.
Although no jingles identical to this one have been found in
archaeological context, objects decorated with similar linear
geometric forms have been found throughout the Dongbei. 3
Traditionally, scholars have given more attention to zoomor
phic motifs than to geometric decorations and linear patterns,
a tendency no longer adequate in the light of recent archaeo
logical finds. Similar designs in various combinations adorn
the belts of male figures carved on deer stones found in north
ern Mongolia. 4 Such patterns must originally have had specific
symbolic meanings: since their distribution, as on the present
jingle, is intentional not just random.

Drum
Northeast China, 7th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 9 in. (22.9 cm); max. diameter £ in. (12.7 cm)
Katherine and George Fan
The larger open end of this one-sided, waisted drum was orig
inally covered with a membrane of thin skin that served as the
tympanum. Below the area where the membrane would have
been attached, the surface is decorated by three bands of
raised running triangles that alternate with two bands of raised
lines. These reflect the original stitching that would have
affixed the membrane to the body of a wooden or pottery
drum . Two mold seam marks that have been filed down are
barely visible on the sides of the drum.
Two similar drums were excavated in the Dongbei, but
their musical function was not recognized and they were
referred to simply as drum-shaped objects. One bronze exam
ple was unearthed at Xiaoheishigou, Ningcheng county,
southeastern Inner Mongolia, and in 1992 another similar
example made of red pottery was discovered. 1
The identification of this object as a drum was recently
confirmed after discussions with the music archaeologist Bo
Lawergren. Several waisted drums made of horn, with shapes
similar to the present bronze drum, were excavated from
tombs at Pazyryk, in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, dating to
the fourth and third centuries B.C. 2
Ceramic drums with similar waisted shapes have been
identified at Neolithic sites in North China, from present-day
Shandong Province in the east to Gansu in the west. 3 Many
of these examples predate the earliest evidence for this type of
drum in northwestern Eurasia at Beycesultan, an Anatolian
178



site in Turkey dated to 1900 — i^ob.c. 4 Whether there is a
relationship between eastern and western waisted drums is
yet to be determined, as the intermediary links, if they ever
existed, have not been discovered. The Beycesultan skin
stitching seems to be the same as the stitching that once
attached the skin membrane to the present drum.
It is worth mentioning that waisted drums were com
pletely alien to Zhou ritual orchestras and do not occur in
China again until the first millennium a.d., when they were
reintroduced by foreign orchestras associated with Buddhism
by way of the Silk Road. 5

Mirror with ungulates
Volga River region, Russia, 8th— 7th century b.c.
Bronze
Height 7 in. (17.8 cm); width 7V2 in. (19. 1 cm)
Published: Sotheby's, New York, sale cat., December 8, 2000.
This oval mirror with two finlike projections on the flanged
rim is decorated in relief with four standing ungulates: an
ibex, a horse, a bovine, and a Bactrian camel. The mirror is
lost- wax cast and was once highly polished.
A mirror of this type, but missing one fin, was discovered
at Selitrennoye Gorodhishiche, near Volgograd, Russia. 1
Another example, also missing a fin, is in the Ortiz collec
tion. 2 It has been suggested that the Ortiz mirror once had a
handle attached through the holes now visible where the break
occurred. In antiquity, it may have been provided with a han
dle after it was damaged, but such mirrors in their original
form did not have fixed handles, as demonstrated by the
present example.
179



It would appear that mirrors of this type were cast in west
ern Eurasia. To date, such mirrors have had little scholarly
attention, and traditionally they have been associated with the
circular mirrors with zoomorphic decoration in raised thread
relief found in eastern Eurasia. 3 With the appearance of this
undamaged example, further investigation into the history of
this unusual type of mirror is now indicated.

Plaquefragment with zoomorphic motif
Northwestern Iran, Ziwiye, 7th century B.C.
Gold
Height in. (14.3 cm); width 2/4 in. (r.7 cm)
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, Joseph Pulitzer
Bequest, 1 9^0 (^o. 1 96a, b)
Published: Wilkinson 195^, p. 219; Amandry 1966, fig. 4:9;
Goldman 1974-77, pp. ssSJ, %s. 1-4.
This gold fragment is embellished with images in repousse of
ibex and deer placed within alternating ribbon-framed spaces
linked together by frontal lions' heads. The ibex and deer are
shown in profile, their legs drawn in under the body, with the
legs overlapping.
The design of the plaque was most likely produced by ham
mering sheet gold over a wooden matrix. Remnants of the
borders reveal perforations punched through from the front
that must have served to attach the plaque to a larger object.
The numerous extant sheet-gold fragments that carry the
same decoration must once have comprised an object exca
vated from the remains of the ancient citadel on Ziwiye, a hill
in Iranian Kurdistan about twenty-five miles east of Saqqiz.'
Known as the Ziwiye Treasure, the artifacts from this find
have been dated to the seventh century B.C. by stylistic com
parison with objects from the ancient Near East that were
excavated under controlled conditions 2
A projected reconstruction of these fragments suggests that
they once formed the sheathing of a belt, presumably backed
by leather or cloth. 3 But the fact that similar bronze sheathing,
once also associated with a belt, is over seventy-eight inches
in length calls into question the identification of the
Metropolitan's fragment as belt decoration. 4 Under the cir
cumstances, its original function must remain open, until fur
ther information becomes available.
The motif of a deer with flowing antlers and folded legs,
with the hooves pointing forward and backward, has tradi
tionally been associated with the Scythians, who were already
in the Black Sea region by the seventh century b.c. s Although
reindeer are not known among the fauna of northwestern
Eurasia, the animal must have remained in the collective
memory of this people, remnants of their earlier homeland in
southern Siberia. Images of deer with flowing antlers occurred
earlier on deerstones in southern Siberia and Mongolia and
180



were then modified in northwestern Asia, where the image
was combined with Near Eastern and Greek elements to form
what was to become a hallmark of Scythian art. 6

Fitting with two horses' heads
Northeast China, 6th — ^th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 4 A in. (10.8 cm); length 13/4 in. (34.9 cm)
Ex coll.: J. J. Lally & Co., New York
Two superb horse's heads in the round adorn this fitting. Each
horse is shown with alert, upright ears, round eyes indicated
by circular raised rims with sunken centers, and slightly open
mouths outlined with indented lines. The fitting itself is a long
bar with thirteen circular perforations. The horse's heads
were first lost-wax cast and then cast onto the fitting. Both
the heads and the fitting are made of a lead, tin, and copper
alloy, and corrosion extends over the cast-on parts.
To date, nothing similar is known from a controlled exca
vation, but stylistically the piece appears to conform to the
artistic vocabulary of the hunting and pastoral peoples who
inhabited Northeast China. A plain bar of similar shape with
thirteen perforations in the David -Weill collection was pub
lished as a chariot ornament, but confirmation must await
future archaeological evidence. 1

Figure of a young man
North China, Shanxi Province, jth century B.C.
Bronze
Height 4 in. (10.2 cm)
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift of Ernest Erickson
Foundation, 198^(85.214.48)
This small bronze sculpture, in the Metropolitan Museum,
represents a young man in a lively pose with upraised arms.
He stands on his right leg with his face turned to the right,
while his left knee is bent, suggesting that he is about to move
forward. He wears a short jacket belted at the waist with a
sash and shoes and appears to be barelegged. A short sword in
a scabbard is secured to his sash at the back by a scabbard slide,
and indented lines mark the details of his costume. The pres
ence of mold seam marks indicates that the figure is piece
mold cast.
The young man's attire and bare legs and the short sword
that he carries suggest that he is not Chinese but a northerner
from beyond the frontiers of China. A virtually identical coun
terpart to this figure in mirror image is in the Freer Gallery of
Art, Washington, D.C. 1 At some point, the Freer figure was
transformed into an acrobat by attaching a qin tuning key sur
mounted by a bear to his raised right hand. The tuning key
was later removed. 2 Excavations at the Jin state foundry site
at Houma, Shanxi Province, have yielded several clay models
and mold fragments for casting figures in similar dress and
wearing short swords at the back. The swords are secured by
scabbard slides dating to the fifth century B.C., suggesting
that both the Freer and the Metropolitan figures were cast
at Houma. 3
To date, the original function of these two figures has not
been determined, but they must represent foreigners at
the court of a northern Eastern Zhou principality, as does
the figure of a wrestler that serves as a lampstand in the Miho
Museum, Shigaraki. 4 A careful examination of the Metro
politan figure suggests that it may once have been part of a
much larger assemblage. The palm of the right hand reveals a
filed-down stump, and the sole of the right shoe has been
drilled. The Metropolitan and Freer figures are so similar that
it is reasonable to consider that they may once have served as
decoration at the opposite corners of some larger object.
These figures display one of the earliest Chinese represen
tations of a scabbard slide. This accoutrement was invented
in an equestrian culture that matured in the Ural steppes of
southern Russia from the seventh to the sixth century B.C. It
was not introduced into China, however, until the fifth cen
tury b.c. When it first appeared in China, it was associated
with bronze short swords, and only later with a long sword,
which did not develop until late in the Warring States period. 5

Mirror with ibex
Northwest China, Xinjiang region, jth— 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 4/8 in. ( 1 r . 7 cm); diameter of mirror 3 % in. (8.3 cm)
Ex. coll.: J. J. Lilly & Co., New York
A standing ibex with gracefully curved, ridged horns shown in
profile serves as the handle of this mirror. The ibex is highly
stylized, with a round depression marking the eye and muzzle.
The legs, which are attached to the rim of the mirror, are
abstracted into two cone shapes. A circular, slightly convex
disk, the mirror has a highly polished reflecting surface on one
side, while the reverse is left unfinished and encircled by a
turned-up rim. A small but sturdy horizontal loop, which was
piece-mold cast integrally with the figure and by which the
mirror could be suspended, is placed behind the ibex's body.
The mirror appears to have been cast separately and then the
ibex handle soldered onto the rim. The smooth, silvery sur
face indicates that the alloy is a high tin bronze.
A mirror of similar design was excavated in 196^ at
Weizixiaxiang, Yiwu district, Xinjiang, 1 and mirrors with sim
ilar tangentially attached zoomorphic handles have been exca
vated from Scythian tombs in the Black Sea region, where they
were produced between the sixth and the fourth century B.C. 2
A sixth-to-fifth-century B.C. mirror of similar design but with
a much larger animal-shaped handle was excavated in the
Minusinsk region of southern Siberia, 3 suggesting that this type
of mirror was probably introduced into the Xinjiang region
from elsewhere in the Eurasian steppes.

date given for this excavated example is far too late, unless the mirror
was retained as an heirloom for a long period of time.

So 1992, fig. 8.
Each of these two rectangular sockets is surmounted by an
alert-looking doe with a turned head. The socket is adorned
on two sides with three intertwined serpents, their bodies
marked by longitudinal, scale-textured bands. Each doe has a
hollow, open-ended muzzle, a characteristic of deer-shaped
yoke ornaments from the Ningxia- Gansu region.' The sil
very colored surface is the result of intentional tinning and the
reddish patches, of corrosion. The sockets have two large oval
holes in each side for attachment, and the entire fitting is
184
bisected by a mold mark, indicating that the doe and socket
were cast integrally in one pour.
The intertwined serpents display stylistic features usually
associated with artifacts cast at the Jin state foundry at Houma,
in southern Shanxi Province, such as scaly texturing that
enhances their reptilian bodies. Similar interlaced designs are
also seen on artifacts excavated from Qin tombs in southern
Shaanxi. It is unclear what these fittings were originally
attached to, but they exhibit a curious combination of both
Qin and northern elements, suggesting that they may have
been made by Qin craftsmen expressly for their herding, non
Chinese neighbors 2

Bird's headjinial
Northwest China, Ningxia and Gansu, ca. 4th century b.c.
Bronze
Height 1 Vi in, (3.8 cm); width 1 in. (2.5 cm)
Ex. coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This small finial is cast in the shape of the head of a bird of
prey. Each of the bird's eyes is represented by a boss sur
rounded by a circular depression, and the mouth by a long
indentation with a raised central strip that follows the curve
of the beak. The socket is rectangular, with a hole on either
side for attachment. The piece is hollow cast, and a mold mark
bisects it longitudinally.



Eagles and other birds of prey are often represented on arti
facts associated with the pastoral peoples on the northwestern
frontier of China. Several small finials similar to the present one
have been excavated at burial sites in Ningxia, at Wangjiaping,
Touying township, 1 and at Langwozikeng, Zhongwei county. 2
In a herding economy, eagles were dangerous predators, as they
could carry off the young animals that were so vital to survival.
They were also used in falconry, which even today is popular in
certain regions of the Eurasian steppes (fig. 3 c).

174. Ornament with ibex
Eastern Eurasian steppes, ca. 4th century B.C.
Bronze
Height 4I4 in. (1 1.4 cm); width 3/8 in. (8.6 cm)
Ex. coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
This unusual ornament is cast in the shape of a donut and sur
mounted by a recumbent ibex. A raised spiral marks the
shoulder and haunch, and a raised circle describes the eye.
The back of the ornament is flat and has a horizontal loop
behind the shoulder. The plaque was piece-mold cast with
flashing left here and there in the openings
Whether this ornament was purely decorative or had some
specific function is as yet unknown, but it was certainly
attached to something by the loop on the reverse. No identi
cal artifact has been found in archaeological context, but the
object is characteristic of the type associated with the pastoral
peoples of the eastern Eurasian steppes.

Two carved bonejinials
Northwest China, 4th— 3rd century B.C.
Bone
Left: Height 1% in. (4.3 cm); width 1/2 in. (3.8 cm)
Right: Height 1 A in. (3.7 cm); width 1 in. (2.c cm)
Ex. coll.: Joseph G. Gerena Fine Art, New York
These two bone finials are beautifully carved with spiral
designs in broad, graceful lines accentuated by sunken curvi
linear spaces. Following the carving of the bone, the finials
were given a smooth, highly polished surface. A circular
socket drilled into the base of each finial would have enabled
it to be attached to some as yet unidentified object.
Bone artifacts with curvilinear designs similar to those
seen here have been recovered from pastoral burials in



southern Ningxia, in the Guyuan region. Several were found
at Yanglong, 1 and others in burials at the Yujiazhuang ceme
tery, Pengpu township. 2
Objects of bone were not uncommon among the pastoral
peoples, but they rarely survived and are not always accorded
the same attention as that given to bronze artifacts. An easily
available animal product, bone could readily be made into
buckles, ornaments, and other fittings, even when people
were on the move. To produce the polished surface and grace
fully carved designs that occur on these finials took a highly
accomplished craftsman.

Raptor's-headjinial
Northwest China, Ningxia, 3rd century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Height 5 Vi in. (14 cm); width A in. (2.2 cm)
Ex. coll.: R. H. Ellsworth, Ltd., New York
This finial is cast in the shape of a stylized raptor's head with
a long neck. The eyes are each represented by a bulging, oval
shaped boss and the beak by a sharp, curved triangle. The neck
terminates in a long tubular socket with a ridged ring that may
imitate an earlier mechanical coupling join which has been
retained as a decorative element. Two holes are visible, one
behind each ear, but their function or what they once held is
unknown. The finial is hollow, with wood fragments remain
ing inside. It is a lost-wax-cast leaded, tin bronze, with a sur
face that has been enriched by tinning. The finial is further
distinguished by splashes of vermilion cinnabar, a red sub
stance often used as a ritual preservative in burials
The extreme stylization of this finial is quite unusual, but
a smaller finial excavated at Wangjiaping, Ningxia, is similar
enough to suggest that it can also be associated with the Ningxia
region of Northwest China during the second half of the first
millennium B.C. 1 The raptor represented is a mythological
creature with almond-shaped eyes rather than more natura
listic round birds' eyes. Such creatures ultimately derive
from Greek and Iranian iconography and were introduced into
the eastern Eurasian steppes sometime during the fourth
century b.c. 2
This finial is very different from another raptor-headed
finial, catalogue no. 173, which represents a real bird rather than
a mythical creature . The type of ring-shaped coupling seen on
this example occurs frequently as a decorative feature on garlic
neck hu vessels that have been excavated at Qin sites dating to
the third century B.C. 3 Such similarities suggest that it may
have been made in a Qin foundry during the third century b.c.
for trade with the nomadic peoples north of the Great Wall.

Finial in the shape of a tiger's head
North China, 3rd century b.c.
Tinned bronze
Diameter 2 in. (^.1 cm)
Ex. coll.: Richard Kimball Designs, Denver
This tiger's mask once surmounted the curved top of a tinned
bronze finial. The tiger's features are shown in relief and skill
fully articulated. The presence of a woven pattern on the
underside of the mask indicates that it was cast by the lost
wax and lost-textile process. After casting, the mask was
enhanced by tinning, much of which has worn off.
Similar finials cast in the shape of an animal's head have
been found in numerous late Warring States and early Western
Han burials. A very handsome example inlaid with silver was
exhibited in Hong Kong in 1 990. 1 The use of tinning suggests
that the present example was made in a northern Chinese
metalworking center west of the Taihang Mountain range, as
tinning was seldom employed in Northeast China.

Tuning keyfor a qin
North China, 3rd— 2nd century B.C.
Bronze
Height 3
lA in. (8.3 cm)
Published: Christie's New York, sale cat., Sept. 21, 2000.
A bear balanced atop a tall squared shaft is represented on this
tuning key for a a type of zither called a qin. The shaft ends in
a square socket that would have fit over the square tip of a
tuning peg. The center of the bear's arched back is cut out to
fit a hinged crescent-shaped blade with a triangular cross sec
tion. The body is pierced through for a peg to keep the blade
open, and both the body and the shaft are cast integrally by the
lost- wax process.
Long a puzzle to archaeologists, this type of object has
recently been identified as a tuning key for a Chinese qin, a
plucked string instrument that is tuned by tightening each
string around a tuning peg. 1 Remains of the earliest known
qin were found in South China, in the late-fifth-century B.C.
tomb of the marquis of Zeng in Sui county, Hubei Province. 2
By contrast, the earliest known bronze tuning keys, which are
decorated with zoomorphic motifs that relate to traditions
found beyond the frontiers of China, 3 appear to have been cast
in North China.
The crescent-shaped blade on the back of the bear, which
may originally have been sharper, has been described as a plec
trum, 4 but, according to the music archaeologist Bo
Lawergren, such usage would have damaged the string and
thus cannot be substantiated. Instead, as Dr. Lawergren has
convincingly suggested, it was a tool used to cut the thin silk
187



strings of the qin when they snapped and had to be repaired. 5
Such a blade attached to the tuning key would have been a
very handy gadget in a qin player's toolkit.
The persistence of northern motifs on tuning keys, as well
as the qins portability, suggests that plucked string instru
ments may have been introduced into China through contact
with peoples to the northwest. The remains of a harp recov
ered from a fourth- century b.c. grave at Pazyryk, in the Altai
Mountains, are ample evidence for the existence of plucked
string instruments among the herding peoples of the eastern
Eurasian steppes, where gut and sinew strings were more
common. 6
A tuning key similar to the present example, but without
the tiny flick knife, was recovered from a late Warring States
burial site at Luoyang, Henan Province. 7 It would seem that
the addition of the tiny knife to the qin players 's toolkit was a
Western Han innovation.

Se string anchor (se rui)
China, 3rd— 2nd century b.c.
Gilded bronze
Height iVi in. (6.4 cm)
Lent by Shelby White and Leon Levy
This spectacular gilded-bronze mountain with jagged peaks
inhabited by wild beasts surmounts the square socket of a se
rui, or zither string anchor. The mountain is solidly cast, with
a dragon and a tiger in high relief climbing around the sides.
The dragon's and the tiger's bodies are entwined around
and partially obscured by the undulating, stylized cliffs. The
dragon, with its head outstretched toward the summit, is
flanked by a bear that stands on its hind legs and a crouching
monkey with its paw to its mouth. The piece is lost- wax cast
integrally with the square socket, which has beveled edges.
During the Han period, se rui were usually cast in sets of
four but could have as few as two or as many as live. The se
normally had from twenty-three to twenty-six strings that
were gathered into four bundles, each wound around one of
four anchors with identical decoration. 1 A similar mountain
shaped anchor with traces of string still wrapped around it was
discovered among the burial goods found at Shouzhou, Anhui
Province. 2 Shouzhou was the capital of the state of Chu from
241 B.C. until 223 B.C., when it was conquered by the Qin.
During the early Western Han, its fortunes fluctuated, and
Shouzhou was, off and on, a provincial Chu capital during the
early part of the second century b.c, when this small moun
tain-shaped anchor was probably cast.
Excavations in Guangdong Province confirm the function
of these zither string anchors. Four similar mountain-shaped
anchors were discovered in Guangzhou, in the second
century b.c. tomb of the king of Nanyue. 3 According to the
excavation report, wood fragments were found inside the
sockets, suggesting that they were designed to fit over the
wooden pegs used to anchor the strings. The mountain-shaped
anchors served also as knobs with which to turn the pegs. This
motion would then produce the tension that would determine
the pitch and the scale. 4
The recent suggestion that stringed instruments in ancient
China may possibly have had a northern origin hints at an inter
esting new interpretation of the Han image of the mountain
inhabited by wild animals. 5 This theory is supported by the
188



innumerable mountain-shaped censers and jars that display
such imagery which appeared at a time when the Han Chinese
were in close association with the nearby pastoral world (fig. r 2).
The cosmic mountain as the most prominent image of the
cosmic pillar that connects heaven, earth, and the underworld
was a fundamental concept of shamanism, the ancient religion
of nature that was practiced by most of the herding and hunt
ing peoples throughout northern Eurasia. 6 During the fourth
and third centuries b.c, these symbolic mountains inhabited
by wild animals were represented in vertically integrated land
scapes portrayed on headdresses associated with the steppe
peoples. The headdresses, such as the late-fourth-century B.C.
example from Issyk-Kul, near Almaty, Kazakhstan, describe
the steppe and mountain pastures that dominated the nomadic
world and display motifs of tigers and other animals among
the mountain peaks (fig. $4).
It is this concept that is reflected in the Han censers and in
the mountain landscapes on the small zither string anchors.
The strong parallels between early Han landscapes in the
round and pastoral imagery may have been a major catalyst to
the integrated development of pictorial Chinese landscape
representation rather than the art of the ancient Near East,
which is frequently cited but exhibits no parallels 7
With its newly recognized northern heritage, a small moun
tain teeming with wildlife seems quite appropriate for a fitting
on an instrument that has also been considered to have a north
ern pastoral ancestry. In this way, the present anchor fits eas
ily with the other two qin and se fittings, catalogue nos. 178
and 180, which also display distinctly northern subject matter.

Zither string anchor (se rui)
North China, 3rd — 2nd century b.c.
Gilded bronze
Diameter 2 in. (^.1 cm)
Ex. coll.: Michael Dunn, New York
A mythological ungulate with inverted hindquarters is here
ingeniouslv manipulated to embellish the domed cap for the
square socket of a .se string anchor. It has a beaked head, a sin
gle antler, a bifurcated crest, and a long tail, with striated
enclosures on the body. The piece is lost-wax cast.
A nearly identical se rui was excavated at the Shangwang
cemetery in the Linzi district of Zibo city, Shandong Province,
the capital of the state of Qi during the late Warring States
and Han periods. 1 Such fittings were cast in sets of four to
serve as anchors for the strings of a se zither that were gathered
together and wound around them. 2
Like the bear motif on the qin tuning key, catalogue no. 178,
the mythological ungulate has strong associations with the art
of the north and was a popular symbol on artifacts dating to
the latter half of the first millennium B.C. (see cat. nos. 72, 76,
99) 1 £9)- The possibility of northern influence on the devel
opment of early plucked string instruments in ancient China is
supported by these findings and warrants further investigation. 3

Pair offittings in the shape of carnivores
North China, 3rd — 2nd century B.C.
Tinned bronze
Left: Length 4/^2 in. ( 1 1 .4 cm); width 1 A in. (4. 8 cm);
diameter of ring 1 Va in . (3.2 cm)
Right: Length 3 V2 in. (8.9 cm); width 7A in. (2,2 cm)
Ex. coll.: R. H. Ellsworth, Ltd., New York
Each of these two fittings terminates in a small carnivore's
head with a long muzzle and with its ears laid back. A ring is
suspended from the mouth of the carnivore on the left, while
the ring for the fitting on the right is missing. The opposite
end of each fitting has an open socket into which an object was
once inserted. The ridged rings around each socket imitate an
earlier mechanical coupling join that has been retained as a
decorative element, similar to that on catalogue no. 176. Each
fitting is lost-wax cast onto a precast ring. The surface has
been intentionally tinned to give it a burnished appearance.
Two fittings of a similar type with animal-head terminals
were excavated at the Qi state cemetery near Shangwang, in
the Linzi district of Zibo city, Shandong Province. 1 Such
fittings probably embellished the wood pole ends of a litter
bearer frame or platform and held tassels appropriately col
ored for those occasions when the litter was in use. Bits of
wood are still visible inside the sockets.

Incense burner lid with stag
Western Pakistan, ca. ist century B.C.
Bronze
Height 4 Vi in. (10.8 cm); diameter 2 7A in. (7.3 cm)
Ex. coll.: James Freeman, Kyoto
A stag with gathered feet stands atop a hill with eight petals at
the base. The hill, in turn, surmounts a dome decorated in
openwork with three registers of floral and zoomorphic
motifs. The bottom register appears to depict either a floral
motif or some kind of winged insect seen from above, and the
second register shows recumbent lions and standing, horned
ungulates that may be sheep. Above this parade of animals is
a register with double-ended spirals. The entire piece is lost
wax cast.
The function of this interesting object, said to have come
from western Pakistan, is not readily apparent, but the open
work and the object's similarity to lids used for incense burn
ers suggest that it may have served the same purpose. Several
Indo-Scythian bronze incense burners have lids of similar shape
with openwork decoration, 1 and there is a significant parallel to
the lid of a first-century b.c. Indo-Scythian covered vessel, also
said to come from Pakistan, that is now in the Miho Museum,
Shigaraki. 2 The Miho lid is surmounted by an ibex, also with
gathered feet, in a pose very similar to that of the stag seen here.

8. VESSELS AND IMPLEMENTS
The eighth and final section includes bronze vessels, some of
which can be attributed to the pastoral groups bordering
ancient China. Other examples were cast in China but exhibit
design features taken from the pastoral world (cat. nos. 1 84,
1 1;). Although the pastoral peoples never practiced the com
plex ceremonies that produced the ritual vessels of ancient
China, some utilitarian vessels appear also to have served cer
emonial purposes on certain occasions.

Spoon
Northwest China, 1 3th— 1 ith century B.C.
Bronze
Length cT's in. (1 j cm)
[Catherine and George Fan
This spoon is distinguished by an elliptical bowl and a long
handle terminating in an animal's head. On the upper side of
the handle, which bears a series of raised dots, is a suspension
loop, while three loops, one of which retains its small oblong
pendant, depend from the underside. Originally, the other
two underside loops would have also had pendants that would
have made a jingling sound when the spoon was in motion.
Longitudinal mold marks along the side of the handle suggest
production in a piece mold. Each pendant was cast separately
and then placed in the mold when the spoon was cast. The
handle of the spoon was originally straight, but has become
bent through usage.
Similar spoons with pendants have been excavated from
the graves of China's northern pastoral neighbors west of the
Taihang Mountains at Chujiayu, Shilou county, Shanxi
Province. 1 A similar spoon was also found at the waist of a
192



dead male in a grave excavated at Shangdongcun, Ji county,
Shanxi, contemporaneous with the late Shang period — from
the thirteenth to the eleventh century B.C. — but non- Shang
in character. 2 Spoons in the sedentary Chinese world were
used for cooking and eating and were not carried on one's
person, as they were in the more mobile, pastoral world. 3
Spoons with suspension loops were probably introduced
into eastern Asia from northwestern Siberia and eastern
Europe, where both men and women habitually carried
them. 4 The noisemaking jingles appear to have been an east
ern addition, like the rattles on other artifacts belonging to
China's northern neighbors. (See also cat. nos. 26, 28, 29.)

This tall slender wine container has a smooth, undecorated
surface and a fitted lid that serves, when inverted, as a small
drinking vessel. Like a modern-day Thermos bottle, it was
designed to be portable. A cord or leather strap by which it
could be suspended was run through the two holes in the
flared foot, up through the two small handles on each side,
and finally through the two holes in the flared top of the lid.
When all the holes were aligned, the lid was secured and the
vessel could be carried.
Wine containers similar to the present hu in shape and
design have been found at numerous archaeological sites in
North China, which have yielded evidence for active contact
between the Chinese and the northern pastoral peoples dur
ing the late eleventh and tenth centuries B.C. , such as at Baifu,
Changping county, outside Beijing, 1 and at the Yu family
cemetery at Rujiazhuang, Baoji county, southern Shaanxi
Province. 2 During the tenth century B.C., vessels of this shape
193



continued to be produced in dynastic China, where they rep
resented a new type and were decorated with typical Western
Zhou designs. 3

This cauldron, or Ju, is distinguished by a deep rounded
U-shaped bowl on a short flared stem foot and two upright
handles placed opposite each other on the rim of the bowl.
The handles are marked by slanting parallel lines so that each
resembles a twisted rope. The bowl is decorated with two
horizontal registers separated by a twisted rope band. The top
register displays a typical Western Zhou running design of
S-shaped motifs and the bottom register, two rows of U
shapes that encircle the bowl. The presence of a sooty black
substance in the grooves is evidence that the vessel was once
subjected to fire. A casting sprue projects beneath the^u
within the flared stem foot, suggesting that the vessel was cast
integrally with the foot and handles upside down in a multi
piece mold.
A smaller example of this type of/u, with similar Western
Zhou decoration, was recovered near Xi'an, Shaanxi
Province. 1 The vessel has no Chinese antecedent, which sug
gests that the shape was based on a non-Chinese example
made in another material.
Vessels of this shape became a diagnostic artifact of the pas
toral peoples, serving both ceremonial and mundane func
tions. Unlike Chinese ritual vessels, the steppe cauldrons
have, until recently, received little scholarly attention. 2 The
Chinese may have been the first to cast this type of vessel in
bronze. Before the eighth century B.C., they were probably
made in hammered metal or carved wood, with real twisted
rope handles. Vessels such as the hammered bronze stem
footed cauldron from the Trialeti cemetery in Transcaucasia,
Georgia, may have preceded the eastern Eurasian type. 3 By
the seventh or sixth century B.C., castju occur in burials in
northern Hebei 4 and also in burials in the Black Sea region
associated with the Scythians. s

This bronze cauldron is typical of the vessels used by the hunt
ing and herding peoples who lived beyond China's northern
frontiers. Primarily utilitarian, they have a cone-shaped base
that was pierced in three places to allow heat to escape when
they were placed over a fire. The handles are rectangular in
shape with three points on the top. A pendant casting sprue
l 9S



within the base and mold marks that bisect the vessel indicate
that it was cast upside down integrally with the handles in a
multipiece mold. (See also cat. no. 18 5-.)
Similar cast cauldrons occur at numerous pastoral sites dat
ing to the latter half of the first millennium B.C. , but they have
minor differences in design. Cauldrons with rounded handles
are considered to be earlier than cauldrons with rectangular
handles, like the example seen here, and cauldrons with an
openwork foot appear to be of later date than those with a
solid walled foot. 1
A very similar but smaller cauldron, with the same rec
tangular handles with three points on the top, was found in
the Qingyang region of southeastern Gansu Province, sug
gesting that the present cauldron, in the Fan collection, may
come from the same vicinity. 2 Erdy dates both and the
Qingyang example from the third to the second century b.c. 3
The rough casting of the presentfu suggests that it was made
locally and not at a Chinese metalworking center.

This cauldron, from the Fan collection, is distinguished by a
bulging, almost hemispherical bowl on a conical foot with four
openings, and two handles that are each surmounted by three
mushroom shapes on stems. It is provided with a lid that has
a handle also surmounted by three mushroom shapes on
stems, like those on the handles.
The cauldron is the same type as, but far more complete
than, a cauldron excavated from a tomb at Lingpi village,
Horinger county (Hohhot) municipal district, Inner
Mongolia. 1 The foot of the Lingpi cauldron is broken off, and
the lid is missing. Consequently, the Fan cauldron is crucial in
demonstrating how the Lingpi example looked originally. The
Lingpi vessel has been associated with the Xianbei people,
who succeeded the Xiongnu as rulers of the eastern grasslands
north of the Great Wall of China. 2
The mushroom-shaped decoration suggests thatju devel
oped into ritual vessels, acquiring symbols that are little
understood today. Later cauldrons, with more prominent
mushroom-shaped projections, have been found in Xinjiang,
Northwest China, and may mark the route taken by mobile
horse-riding groups who ultimately carried such vessels into
Eastern Europe, where they became important objects among
the early inhabitants of Hungary. 3

THE LEGACY OF NOMADIC ART IN
CHINA AND EASTERN CENTRAL ASIA
James C . Y . Watt
THE XIONGNU AND THE ORDOS REGION
The northern provinces of China from early histor
ical times were inhabited by a mixture of races and
ethnic groups with no clear cut boundaries until
the time of the Eastern Zhou (770 — 2c6 B.C.). At this time
various states in the north that shared a common culture
with those in the Central Plains (along the middle and lower
reaches of the Yellow River) began to build walls on their
northern frontiers as a defensive measure against nomadic
tribes, who were probably becoming more persistent in
raiding and in their demand for trade. The walls were more
or less joined together in the Qin dynasty (221 — 206 B.C.),
which saw the first unified empire in China. At the same
time, a powerful confederation of nomadic tribes was being
formed to the north, under the leadership of the Xiongnu.
The sheer scale of the political entities thus created on either
side of the walls engendered a new mode of interaction
between the sedentary civilization in China and the nomadic
world to the north, with the Great Wall standing for the line
of demarcation. 1
An essential precondition for forming a confederation of
nomadic tribes was the establishment of a "court" (Chinese
historians called it a ting) as a command center and supply
base. Early in the process of confederation under Xiongnu
leadership, the area of the Selenga River drainage in the
Transbaikal became the seat of power. This region provided
ideal pasture and could also be irrigated for agriculture, cre
ating the conditions for settlements — at least for most of
the year — where necessities for daily use and for warfare
could be produced. Agriculture was particularly important
at this stage of political development for the nomads to gain
minimal economic independence, removing the constant
need to trade or raid for grain from agrarian neighbors — as
no people, including nomads, can survive solely on animal
products. A number of fortified settlement sites in the
Transbaikal associated with the Xiongnu have been excavated
and studied by Russian archaeologists in recent years. 2 At
one of the sites in the Selenga River valley, known as the
Ivolga complex, the finds "demonstrate that the inhabitants
of the site were engaged in agriculture, cattle breeding,
hunting and fishing, and that their occupations included
metalwork in iron, bronze, and precious metals." 3
Another area that served similar military and economic
purposes, though it was not necessarily a political center,
was the Ordos region in Northwest China. As a geographic
term, the Ordos denotes the northern part of the area sur
rounded by the great loop of the Yellow River (see the map
on pp. xii—xiii). It is a land of mixed ecology, with grassland
and desert; but in the northernmost part, south of the
Yinshan Mountains, the river flows from west to east
through a fertile plain that provides excellent pasture and
arable land . Other regions in the Ordos can be irrigated by
the waters of the Yellow River. During those periods in his
tory when the Ordos was occupied by a Chinese population,
systems of canals were built to serve this function. 4 It appears
that in earlier times, there was more grass cover in the
Ordos than in later centuries. In the early fifth century b.c. ,
it was the territory of the state of Xia (a.d. 407 - 3 1 ), founded
by an unregenerate Xiongnu by the name of Helian Bobo,
who made his capital, Tongwan, in an area that is now pure
desert but was lush with vegetation at the time/
The Ordos became strategically important to the Xiongnu
from about the third century B.C., when they emerged as
the leading tribe in the confederation of nomads in the
Mongolian steppes and when the region served as a supply
199



base and forward position in their economic and military
dealings with China. For the Chinese, the same region rep
resented a frontier that guarded the approach to the
Guanzhong area, at the center of which were the capitals of
the Qin and Han empires (near present-day Xi'an). From
time to time, the Xiongnu would be driven out of the Ordos
and a wall would be built well to the north — by the short
lived Qin dynasty and during the reign of Emperor Wudi
(r. 140 — 87 b.c.) of the Han. However, the periods of Han
occupancy were never long and, after Wudi, the region basi
cally remained in the dominion of the Xiongnu for several cen
turies, until they disappeared from the scene as an identifiable
ethnic group and other nomads from Mongolia moved in.
These cycles of occupation would recur throughout Chinese
history, and the region would witness many drastic changes,
resulting from forced movements of large populations, prepa
rations for massive military campaigns, and battles. The events
are recorded indifferently in historical writings, and the
human dimension associated with the changes are brought to
life only in Chinese literature — especially in poetry — and in
the songs of the nomads. For the agricultural Chinese, the
Ordos is a land of sorrows. But the nomads sing of the joy of
life under the Yinshan Mountains, where their flocks and herds
multiply, and of their sadness at the loss of the land they have
from time to time had to abandon.
In recent centuries, as the desiccation of the Ordos
advanced, large numbers of metal objects became exposed
on the surface of the earth, including utilitarian objects
such as knives and axes and ornamental plaques with animal
designs. It is difficult to estimate what proportion of the
ornamental objects was made of gold, as they would have
been put to good use by the peasantry who found them. But
some of the bronze plaques, starting in the nineteenth cen
tury, would eventually find their way into antiquarian col
lections. In the twentieth century, as more objects were
found either on the surface of the earth or by archaeological
excavation, the type of bronze ornaments known to have
come from the Ordos region gave rise to the term "Ordos
bronzes" and attracted wide attention. Most Ordos bronzes
date from the third to the first century b.c. and can be asso
ciated with the Xiongnu. 6 Unfortunately, the term has been
applied rather indiscriminately to all "animal style" objects
found in the vast northern border areas of China, irrespec
tive of place of discovery or dating. 7 This is a pity, as the
term Ordos bronze, with its multiple associations of place,
history, and cultural interaction, can be a useful term in
archaeological and historical writing when properly defined.
The Xiongnu were not the only nomads the Chinese had
to contend with in the Han period, nor was the Ordos the
only region of interaction between nomadic tribes and the
settled population of North China. But the Xiongnu were
the paramount power in the Mongolian steppes during this
time and the Ordos the most important theater for acts of
cultural exchange. The interaction between the Chinese and
the nomads in other areas on the northern border would fol
low similar lines on a lesser scale.
In the following section, an attempt will be made to out
line the aftermath of the increased contact between the
nomadic peoples and the settled population of North China
beginning in the Western Han (206 B.C.—a.d. 9) in the last
two centuries b.c
THE LEGACY OF NOMADIC ART IN CHINA
The Great Wall, from the beginning, did not so much
create a dividing line between ethnic groups as between
different ways of life. As peoples from a nomadic back
ground migrated south, whether as conquerors or as cap
tives or fleeing from natural disasters or hostile tribes, they
would sooner or later acculturize to a way of life and to a
sociopolitical organization on the Chinese model. At the
same time, the northerners would bring with them customs
and beliefs that would be absorbed to varying degrees into
the Chinese system or eventually discarded. The horse
sacrifice, for example, brought into North China by the
Xianbei confederation in the late fourth century a.d. was
being discontinued by the mid-sixth century. There is a
telling passage in the biography of Lei Shao, a military leader
who in the (,30 s supported the establishment of the Western
Wei dynasty (a.d. 53 c— c6) in today's Shaanxi Province,
that records his instructions in his will to his sons: "The
funeral practice in my home district [Wuchuan, north of
present-day Hohhot, in Inner Mongolia] entails the sacrifice
of a big horse. It is of no benefit to the deceased and you
should discontinue it." 8 Lei Shao, to judge from his name,
was probably an ethnic Qiang but an acculturized Xianbei
as were all military officers guarding the frontier fortress at
Wuchuan. Whatever the original or religious significance

attached to the horse sacrifice, by this time it was obviously
lost in the collective memory of the peoples in North China
who inherited the tradition.
A similar course was followed in exchanges in the visual
arts. Certain styles and motifs, once introduced into China,
would remain as part of the permanent language and vocab
ulary of the decorative arts, devoid of their original conno
tation and, in most cases, modified so as to be intelligible in
terms of Chinese sensibility. In other instances, the popu
larity was short-lived and the style or motif would fade away,
leaving only the faintest trace.
The "animal combat" motif is a chief example of the
persistence and transformation in China of a popular theme
in the art of the steppe world. A common article in affluent
households in the Western Han period was the mat weight,
used on the corners of sitting mats. Most of the examples
that have survived to this day are in the form of a bear and a
tiger in combat, of solid cast bronze, often gilded, or hol
low cast and filled with lead (see, for example, fig.
There are also versions in jade. 9 Objects featuring the theme
of animal combat had appeared earlier in China, in the fourth
century b.c.'° However, these were the products of a state
established in northern Hebei Province by a nomadic tribe
known as the Xianyu, or Baidi, rather than objects made by
the Chinese — despite the fact that inscriptions on Xianyu
ritual vessels demonstrate that they had thoroughly assimi
lated Confucian systems of political and ethical thought. 1
Moreover, the combatants in the Chinese version of this
motif in the Western Han are conventionalized and restricted
to the bear and the tiger.
The animal -combat motif persisted in Chinese art, taking
various unexpected forms. The eleventh- century artist
collector Mi Fu recorded a Tang (a.d. 618 — 907) painting he
had seen of two horses biting each other, 1 and there are jade
carvings probably of the Tang period of paired animals bit
ing and clawing. 13 In carvings of later periods, however, the
animals seem to be locked in a friendly embrace. The ulti
mate adaptation of this motif in Chinese art is manifested in
eighteenth-century jade carvings of a pair of playful animals
clutching at each other (fig. ^6). This type of carving was
known as shuanghuan, literally "double jackal," but a rebus
for "mutual delight."
Other aspects of Chinese art in the late centuries B.C. that
were likely to have been inspired by contact with nomads
had a limited duration . One example is the predilection for
gilding. There are spectacular examples of gilded objects in
201



Figure 57. Gilded bronze horse, Western Han. 2nd— 1st century B.C.
Museum of Maoling Mausoleum (after Tokyo 1986, pi. 72)
the early Han period, such as the horse (fig. 57) and the
incense burner from a tomb that dates to the early reign of
Emperor Wudi. 14 The sheer scale of the Chinese objects (the
horse is nearly twenty-five inches high) would have made it
impracticable to cast them in pure gold, but the thickness of
the gilding must have created an impression of solid gold. It
should be noted that the animal patterns on the lower part of
the bowl of the incense burner are entirely nomadic in style
(see fig. ro on p. 34).
The inscriptions on the incense burner indicate that
these objects were made in the imperial workshops. The
fashion for gilding large objects declined after the Western
Han, for economic and /or cultural reasons. It was revived
in the first half of the Tang dynasty, when the Chinese empire
extended far into Central Asia, and less commonly
employed thereafter.
Chinese contact with the nomadic world during the
Western Han was not confined to Mongolia, which was
dominated by the Xiongnu confederation. There are unmis
takable indications of exchanges farther to the west along the
Eurasian steppes. It has been observed for some time that
there is a striking similarity between a certain image seen on
gold ornaments found in the Almaty region of southeastern
Kazakhstan, north of the Tianshan Mountains in Central
Asia, and Chinese decorative art of the same period. This
image is the "feathered man" with flowing hair, riding on a
winged chimera or dragon. It appears, for example, on an
openwork gold diadem dating from the second century B.C.
to the first century a.d. found in the Kargali valley in the
Almaty region (fig. c, 8). ' s The image is described in Chinese
literature of the Han dynasty 16 and seen on Chinese paint
ing, pottery, and jade carvings of the same period.' 7 One
of the jade carvings is in the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery,
Washington, D.C. (fig. £9). The fact that the feathered man
is known to represent an immortal (xian) in Han China and
that its significance, if any, in the nomadic world is not

known does not necessarily give primacy of the occurrence
of the image to China. It is quite possible that the Chinese
adopted the image and gave it a native meaning, something
that has happened in other instances. It should perhaps be
pointed out, for the purpose of future discussion, that in the
Almaty image the rider's head is turned backward and the
flow of his hair is in the direction opposite to the movement of
the galloping animal , whereas in the Chinese image the rider
always looks forward and his hair flows backward, naturally.
Another element in the design pattern of the gold diadem
that parallels Chinese decorative schemes of the Western
Han is the wavy lines that serve as the ground pattern. A
series of diagrams consisting of circular dots amid wavy lines
(fig. 60) are painted on the pottery slabs that form the ceil
ing tiles of a late Western Han tomb in Luoyang. The dots
have been interpreted as representations of stellar constella
tions — the earliest of such known in China. 18 In all discus
sions of these diagrams, little attention has been paid to the
wavy pattern, which consists of two sets of more or less par
allel undulating lines of different shades that are presumed to
represent clouds. This type of cloud representation, which
was to become extremely popular in the decorative arts in
the several centuries following the Western Han in China, as
seen for example in silk textiles (fig. 61), seems to have
made its first appearance at the same time as the feathered
man. Indeed, in the same tomb with the constellation dia
grams, on the openwork pottery tiles that form the gable of
the partition in the middle of the tomb chamber, there is also
a representation of a feathered man riding on a dragon not
unlike the image on another part of the Almaty diadem,
except that the Chinese figure wears a conical hat (fig. 62,
and fig. 63 on the left side). Furthermore, in the same Han
tomb, on the other side of the openwork pottery tiles, are

rather unusual manner of ornamenting the bodies of animals,
however, soon disappeared from the Chinese repertory.
There are other areas in the arts of the Western Han
that would lend themselves to this kind of observation, 20 but
the above examples may suffice to make the point that a
major aspect in the decorative art of China in the last two
centuries B.C. is related to that of the nomads of the steppes
from the Altai in southern Siberia to the Tianshan in Central
Asia. It is not possible at present to trace the route or the

mode of transmission of ideas and motifs. The finds of
Chinese objects at Pazyryk provide evidence that the actual
transfer of objects was involved. The Xiongnu, whose ter
ritory extended into the Orkhon River valley, in the
Transbaikal, may well have been the intermediary between
the Altai and North China, and may possibly have provided
the indirect contact between China and the Tianshan
region, although there could have been more direct traffic
between China and Central Asia via the Gansu corridor in
Northwest China. 21
Toward the end of the first century B.C., both the Han
empire and the Xiongnu confederation collapsed. 22 This
marked the beginning of another phase in the interaction
between the nomadic tribes and the sedentary populations in
North China. While there was a restoration of the Han
dynasty after a brief interregnum at the beginning of the first

century, the Xiongnu never completely recovered. Unable
to exact large subsidies from the court of the Later (or
Eastern) Han (a.d. 2 c — 2 20) and suffering from a succession
of natural disasters and military setbacks, the Xiongnu in the
middle of the first century a.d. broke into two factions, one
moving westward into Central Asia and the other into North
China, settling in several communities in what is now Shanxi
Province. At the same time, other nomadic tribes, from the
northeastern and western borders of China, also began to
migrate into traditional Chinese territory and, by the fourth
century, various tribes of nomadic background were able
to set themselves up as rulers of small states with a mixed
population of Han Chinese and nomads — the so-called
Sixteen States.
The fourth and fifth centuries were a period of intense
mutual acculturation, but the exchange was more in social
institutions and customs than in artistic traditions, as the
nomads in China gradually adapted to Chinese material cul
ture. Indeed, pastoral tribes that had established themselves
in China, such as the Toba Xianbei, who eventually united
North China under the Wei dynasty (a.d. 386 — 534), were
busily keeping other tribes at bay along the traditional fron
tiers between China and the steppe region. The new artistic
and cultural fashions that came into China from the fourth to
the sixth century were brought mainly by traders from
Central Asia, particularly from Bactria and Sogdiana
known as the Western Regions in China. But these new
styles and fashions were eclectic creations born of a cross
fertilization of Hellenistic, Iranian, Indian, and nomadic ele
ments. The Xianbei rulers in North China were themselves
captivated by "Western" culture, not only in the visual arts
but in music and dance. 23 Thus, the first cycle of artistic
exchange between China and the nomadic world came to an
end as a result of the mass settlement of nomadic tribes in the
region of North China.
THE LEGACY OF NOMADIC ART IN CENTRAL ASIA
Perhaps the last, and in some ways the most interesting and
somewhat unexpected, manifestation of nomadic art, with
reverberations in both Europe and China, took place in
Central Asia in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries under
the dispensation of the Mongol empire. This very important
event in the art history of Central Asia has only recently been
pointed out by Anne Wardwell in her study of medieval
textiles. In her article "Indigenous Elements in Central Asian
Silk Designs of the Mongol Period, and Their Impact on
Italian Gothic Silks," Wardwell draws attention to the treat
ment of animals, dragons, and other motifs in the design of
Central Asian silks of the Mongol era that exhibit the same
characteristics as those portrayed in the art of the early
nomads. 24 She further demonstrates, quite convincingly, that
Figure 66. Central Asian textile of lampas, silk, and gold with
design of phoenixes amid floral vines. 1 3th-mid-i4th century (after
Wardwell 2ooo, fig. 9)

Figure 68. Wool textile in tapestry weave with design of deer, from
Shanpula cemetery, near Khotan, Xinjiang Province, 2nd century
B.C. — 2nd century a.d. (after Schorta 2001 , fig. 80)
the inspiration for the fantastic designs on Italian Gothic silks
in the fourteenth century was none other than the silks pro
duced in Central Asia under Mongol administration. In par
ticular, she points to the twist in the body of the animals,
which is one of the chief stylistic markers in the art of the early
nomads (as seen, for example, in cat. no. 96), and the motif
of animal combat, albeit in a modified form but nevertheless
retaining the suggestion of spiritedness and energy. The
twisted body applies to both animals and birds, such as the
phoenix in a thirteenth- to mid-fourteenth-century Central
Asian silk (fig. 66). In this design, "the graceful majesty of
the Chinese phoenix has been transformed into a scene of
aggressive frenzy between the birds in one row with those in
the next." 2 ^ The "energy, immediacy and life-threatening
drama of Central Asian animal designs " inspired fourteenth
century Italian weavers to produce silks exemplified by a
fourteenth-century piece formerly in the Kunstgewerbe
museum, Berlin, in which all the characteristic elements are
traceable to early nomadic art (fig. 67).
The Central Asian silks discussed by Wardwell that
influenced Italian silk production and design mostly belong
to a type sometimes known as "cloth of gold" — a weave of
silk and gold threads that maximizes the amount of gold seen
on the surface. Within Central Asia, particularly at Beshbaliq
(present-day Jimsar, in eastern Xinjiang Province), where
weaving workshops were set up in the early years of the
Mongol Empire, 26 a class of silks in tapestry weave was pro
duced that reflects yet another characteristic of the art of the
early nomads — as manifested in animal images of applied
felt from Pazyryk (fig. 6 c). As noted by Griaznov, the color
scheme of the pictorial decoration on the felt hangings is
"entirely arbitrary and conventional," bearing no relation
ship to the natural coloring of the objects represented. 27 The
same exuberant use of color is seen in the textile fragments
(mostly parts of garments) found at the cemetery site at
Shanpula, near Khotan, in Xinjiang Province, Chinese Central
Asia, dating from the second century B.C. to the second cen
tury a.d. This is particularly evident in the wool textiles in
tapestry weave (fig. 68).
As pointed out by Emma C. Bunker, some of the imagery
on the Shanpula tapestries recalls that found on felt hang
ings from Pazyryk dating from the third century B.C. 28 If

comparison of the finds from Pazyryk with those from Shanpula
demonstrates the spread of a distinctive decorative style over
long distances in a relatively short time, the persistence of
this style in Central Asia over the span of more than a millen
nium is attested by silk tapestries from Central Asia in the
Mongol period. These were likely to have been made in
Bashbaliq by Uygurs, who had a long tradition of wearing
silk garments of tapestry weave going back to at least the ninth
century, when they were still in Mongolia. 29 A piece of
Central Asian silk tapestry in The Metropolitan Museum of
Art is a good example (fig. 69). Although the vocabulary of
the motifs is what was current at the time , the artistic idiom
continues very much in the ancient tradition of nomadic art.
Thus, the twisting body of the hybrid dragon (composed of
Chinese and Indian elements) is endowed with the dynamic
life force of an animal in the wild, and the brilliant use of color
for decorative and expressive effect with no regard for the nat
ural coloring of the plants finds no parallel in any artistic tra
dition in the world outside the Eurasian steppes — until the
appearance of Fauvism in Paris in the early twentieth century.
Another aspect of the disjuncture of art and nature is in
the treatment of the vegetal pattern. While the various floral
sprays suggest the look of real plants, they are actually made
up of disparate elements. This is particularly noticeable in
the branch that begins above the mane of the lower dragon.
Emerging from the same stem are flowers and leaves of
different plants, treated as if they occurred that way in
nature. One is tempted to draw a parallel between this man
ner of floral representation and the animal art of the early
nomads, in which parts of an animal's body metamorphose
into the head of a bird or the body of another creature.
There are thus two distinct aspects to the legacy of the
art of the ancient nomads . Certain motifs and decorative
styles are absorbed into the artistic traditions of sedentary
peoples whose territories border the steppes. Such is the case
in China. In Central Asia, the reverse seems to be true.
Motifs originating from adjacent areas of "high culture" find
expression in an artistic language that has its roots in the art
of the early nomads, which, judging from available evidence,
seems to have reached the peak of its development in the
middle of the first millennium b.c. While it is possible to trace
nomadic elements in the arts of China up to the present
time, it is, sadly, impossible to do the same in the arts of
Central Asia, owing to the scarcity of material remains from
that region in the later historical periods. The reason we have
been able to catch a glimpse of Central Asian art in the late
Middle Ages is because of the greatly increased production
of industrial art in the Mongol Empire, particularly luxury
items in gold and silk, the former recovered archaeologically
and the latter preserved in the treasuries of Tibetan temples
and European churches and a few burial sites. Unless future
archaeological work can bring forth material evidence from
other periods, there will always be gaps in our knowledge.
The present discussion has been limited to the eastern
part of the Eurasian steppes and China, as objects in our exhi
bition are mostly from the northern borders of China. It is
to be hoped that studies along similar lines applied to other
areas will one day give us a more complete account of the art
of the ancient nomads as a major source of inspiration in the
visual arts of the greater continent of Eurasia.

facts is made in Wu En 1987, in which sites in the Orkhon River val
ley and the Ordos are identified as being those of the Xiongnu.

However, diplomatic and trading activities were still maintained
between the Han court and various Xiongnu factions, while raiding
activities by the Xiongnu and alliances with other tribes increased.
