Foreword
I, Muhammad ibn Ishaq, have lastly only to add that the
books on this subject are too numerous and extensive to be
recorded in full, and besides the authors keep on repeating
the statements of their predecessors.
al-Nadim, Fihrist, vol. 1, p. 360
Magic, astrology, and witchcraft have become fashionable of
late. The appeal of the mysterious and the occult to the contem
porary public has spawned a considerable literatureon magic,
ancient and exotic alike. Classicists have mined Greek and Latin sources for elements of magic and sorcery, and have
made forays into the neighboring territoriesof the ancient Near
East for parallels, real or assumed.
Knowledgeable as he may be in his own field, the Classical
scholar cannot be expected to be equally well versed in the lit
erature of peoples whose records have survived in the cunei
form script only and are couched in dead languages that have
been deciphered only in the last century. One, Sumerian, is not
related to any known language; the other, Akkadian, even
though it belongs to the Semitic family of languages, diverges
from its relatives sufficiently to be difficult to master. Not sur
prisingly, the most apposite and interesting comparisons often
suffer from a misunderstanding of the Near Eastern material.
Connections between the oriental cultures and their echoes in the west become tenuous if one term of the equation is incor
rectly expressed. To provide a foundation for comparisons the
Near Eastern material needs to be presented in a reliable form.
This is the purpose of my study. My sources are culled from
such scientific texts as medicine, divination, and rituals, which
are not usually included in anthologies of Mesopotamian texts
and are rarely available in translation.
While I do not claim familiaritywith the Classical data, it has
seemed necessary that I refer to Greek and Latin sources as I
attempt to point up parallels. Many suggestions for the paths
to pursue and references to the literaturecame from David Pin

gree, whose wisdom and interest have sustained this work. My
quotes from and my translations of Classical sources are
neither independent nor original; I adduce them simply
because they provide a context that the cuneiform sources lack,
and therefore they situate in a broader background the Near
Eastern texts' terse allusions. The point becomes evident from
the examples of "drawing down the moon," and "seizing the
mouth," discussed in Chapters V and VI.
In spite of some striking similarities which may simply attest
to the universal and ubiquitous nature of magic practices, one
must note that well-attested procedures in Hellenistic and later
magic are not matched in their more specific details by the
Mesopotamian material, as the comparison of rituals for the
confection of amulets and prescriptions for molding figurines
and their paraphernalia shows. Of course, the few Mesopo
tamian rituals with detailed descriptions of the materiaand the
dromena have been many times invoked by comparatists and
historians of religion, from MirceaEliade'sCosmologieetalchimie
babyloniennes(Bucarest: Vremea, 1937 [in Rumanian]; French
translation Paris:Gallimard, 1991)to WalterBurkert'sDie orien
talisierendeEpocheof 1982 (Sitzungsberichte der Heidelberger
Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-historische
Klasse, 1984/1 = TheOrientalizingRevolution,Cambridge, Mass.
and London: Harvard University Press, 1992), not to mention
more romantic and popular books of the past.
There are other important differences between the Near East
and Greece. In Mesopotamia, preserved are those rituals that
exorcists set down in handbooks and handed on to their disci
ples and successors through generations; these can be regarded
as the official scientific manuals of the experts. Magic was not
a marginaland clandestine manipulation; it was an activity pre
scribed and overtly practiced for the benefit of king and court,
or of important individuals-only noxious witchcraft was for
bidden and prosecuted. The magic of the common folk prob
ably was never written down, and we have not much to go on
when seeking to compare it with the material from the West.
Neither can we document from Mesopotamia, as we can from
the Hellenistic world and Rome, the changes in the social and
legal status of magic and its practitioners.Moreover,in the Clas
sical world we are privileged to have a vivid documentation of
viii



FOREWORD
the use of magic in the literarysources, whether they deal with
mythological events or events deemed historical. Classical lit
erature provides the background against which the spells on
lamellae, amulets, or gems can be delimited. The accounts of
the preparation of a magic ritual, its aims, and its effects found
in Homer, Greek drama and novels, in epics such as Lucan's
Pharsalia,or the stories of Lucian, are the envy of the Assyriol
ogist who has to be content with the allusions, or tantalizing
glimpses into the practice of magic, which Mesopotamian
sources allow. The Near Eastern material for this book was collected over
many years of association with the ChicagoAssyrianDictionary;
for the stimulation provided by discussions at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton (in the second term of 1990-91
and the summer of 1992), and for the opportunity to explore
a variety of avenues there I am indebted especially to the fac
ulty of the Institute's School of Historical Studies. The original
impetus to study astral influences in Babylonia, as well as
many suggestions, came from Otto Neugebauer; I could no
longer seek his advice for the final manuscript in Princeton, but
to his memory I would like to dedicate this work.

Introduction
The nobles are deep in sleep,l
the bars (of the doors) are lowered, the bolts(?) are in place
(also) the (ordinary) people do not utter a sound,
the(ir always) open doors are locked.
The gods and goddesses of the country
Samas, Sin, Adad and Istar
have gone home to heaven to sleep,
they will not give decisions or verdicts (tonight).
And the diviner ends:
May the great gods of the night:
shining Fire-star,
heroic Irra, Bow-star, Yoke-star,
Orion, Dragon-star, Wagon, Goat-star,
Bison-star, Serpent-star
stand by and
put a propitious sign
in the lamb I am blessing now
for the haruspicy I will perform (at dawn).2
One of the rare prayers from Mesopotamia that strike a
responsive chord in a modern reader, this prayer, or rather lyric
poem, is known among Assyriologists as 'Prayer to the Gods
of the Night.' The Gods of the Night of the title is but the trans
lation of the Akkadian phrase ill mus?ti that appears in line 14
of this poem and in the incipit of various other versions of
the prayer.
The Gods of the Night, as their enumeration in this poem

'to become numb?'with CAD B p. 44a s.v. balalu)has been read pullusuby

shows, are the stars and constellations of the night sky. How
prevalent is the appeal to stellar deities, and to what extent and
in what circumstances are the gods and goddesses worshipped
in Mesopotamia considered under their stellar manifestations,
is the subject I wish to treat here.
The situational context for reciting this prayer is divination,
and more specifically the preparation by the haruspex
Akkadian baru-of the lamb that will be slaughtered so that the
inspection of its entrails-exta-yield an omen, usually as
answer to the diviner's query. This role of the baruin Meso
potamian divination has not received particular attention in
the many studies that deal with it and with its relationship
to the Etruscan disciplina.3
Other areas of Mesopotamian life that rely on, appeal to, or
use the power of the stars are magic machinations, meant to
cause harm as well as to protect from harm; the confection of
amulets and charms; the establishing of favorable or unfavor
able moments in time; and the complex domain of medicine,
from procuring the herb or other medicinal substance, through
the preparation and administration of the medication.
There is a vast corpus of Babylonian literature, hardly ex
ploited by Assyriologists even, and of which a small part only
is availableto the non-specialist in translation or in excerpt, that
can be mined for references or allusions to astral magic, that
is, efforts to use the influence of the heavenly bodies upon the
sublunar world, for purposes beneficent to man as well as for
evil machinations. Such astral magic, as the art of harnessing
the power of the stars may be called, was practiced on the one
hand by scholars, such as the professional diviners and exor
cists, to foretell the future and to avert evil portents, and on the
other by sorcerers and sorceresses who harnessed the same

INTRODUCTION
powers to inflict harm upon an adversary. The former were
knowledgeable in apotropaic rituals, the latter in black magic.
Of the stars that appear in these magic contexts it is not only
the planets that are invoked for their influence, as they are in
Hellenistic astrology, but also various fixed stars and constella
tions. Babylonian constellations take their names from the
shapes that their configurations suggest: human figures, ani
mals, or common objects, similar, and sometimes identical to
the names they had in Classical antiquity, as we learn from the
descriptions of celestial configurations known as the Greek
and the Barbaric,i.e., non-Greek, spheres,4 the latter usually
taken to refer to the Egyptian or the Babylonian sphere.
Illustrations are rare and late in Mesopotamia; still, we are
able to identify many constellations, even those whose names
are uniquely Babylonian. The identifications are based mainly
on astronomical data; these are complemented and confirmed
by the single cuneiform text that gives a description of part of
the heavens.5 Thus, among the animal figures, the Goat is the
constellation Lyra, and the Snake more or less corresponds
to Hydra; among the demons and divine beings the Demon
with the Gaping Mouth is roughly equivalent to Cygnus (with
parts of Cepheus), and the True Shepherd of the god of the sky,
Anu, is Orion; of the celestial counterparts of terrestrialobjects
the Arrow is Sirius, the Furrow, Spica, and the Wagon is Ursa
Maior, our Big Dipper.
Mathematical astronomy in Mesopotamia appears in the
fifth century B.C. The observation of the heavens and the rec
ognition of the periodicities of heavenly phenomena go back,
nevertheless, much farther in time. The identity of the appear
ances of Venus as Evening star and Morning star was known
early, and so was, though possibly at a later date, that of the
two appearances of Mercury. The telling names given to the
fastest planet, Mercury: the Leaping One,6 and to the slowest,
Saturn: the Steady One7 also testify to the astronomical knowl

Heroic.9 Sun and Moon were included in the number of the
seven planets. The Sun, surveying the entire earth, omnipres
ent and omniscient, was as in other cultures the god of justice,
as expressed in the great hymn to Samas, discussed below, and
the Scales (the constellation Libra, Akkadian Zibanitu)have as
epithet "Samas's star of justice," an association comparable to
that of personified Justice holding the scales in her hand on
medieval representations.10

names or as the deities they represent: Ninurta, Istar, Gula,
etc.; the difference between the two designations may be ex
pressed in the cuneiform writing by the sign that precedes their
names: either the sign for "god" or the sign for "star."The
prefixed cuneiform sign indicates, as do other so-called "deter
minatives,"the class to which an entity belongs. The determina
tive for divine names, customarily transcribed as a raised letter
d (d), is abbreviated from the Sumerian word dingir'god,' itself
evolved from the pictogram representing an eight-pointed star;
the determinative for stars is the word-sign for the Sumerian
word mul 'star,'whose pictographic predecessor was a configu
ration of three stars. Thus, the spellings MUL.PA.BIL.SAaGnd
dPA.BIL.SAG'Sagittarius; MUL.SIPA.ZI.AN.NAand dSIPA.ZI.AN.

Sumerian, an, means 'sky'12 but especially as lords of the
three "paths" in the sky, the "Path of Anu," the "Path of Enlil,"
and the "Path of Ea," which represent three segments of the
horizon over which the stars rise.13 The two appearances of Venus, even though identified as the
same planet, were attributed to two distinct manifestations of
the same deity: As morning star, Venus was female; as evening star, male,14 and the two aspects corresponded to the double
character of Istar as goddess of love and war. As the male deity
Istar is described as bearded,15 and she is so represented on
an Islamic bronze candelabra, now in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs.16 As for Mercury who, just as in Hellenistic astrol
ogy, is both male and female,17 the identity of the planet in his
evening and morning visibilities was recognized long before
astronomical tables calculating Mercury's period were com
posed: Mercury is addressed as "star of sunrise and sunset."18
Mars, the hostile planet, presides over destruction, and is

stands for dingir'god,' is the image of an eight-pointed star.
13For this identification, see David Pingree, BPO 2 p. 17f. The three
"paths" frequently occur in celestial omens.
14 Usually the opposite is held, in conformity with Ptolemy's assignment
of genders to planets in Tetrabiblo1s.6 and 7. The Babylonian evidence is
based on an explanatorytext dealing with Venus, published in 3R53 (K.5990,
republished in AChIstar8) from which the lines "Venusis female at sunset"
and "Venus is male at sunrise" were communicated by Sayce, in TSBA3
(1874)196; the text is also cited by Parpola, LAS2 p. 77 and n. 157. In fact,
K.5990is the only source holding that Venus is female at sunset, while others
(BM 134543,K.10566, 81-2-4,239,etc., see Reiner and Pingree, BPO 3) hold
that Venus ina dUTU. (KUR-ma)sinnigat'is female (rising) in the east.' For
Venus being female in the west see also Wolfgang Heimpel, "The Sun at

equatedwith Nergal,god of pestilence. His rising-first visibilityis a bad omen, portending death of the herds: "Marswill rise and destroy the herd,"'1t9he only prediction of an astronomical
event, apart from omens predicting an eclipse, appearing in other than celestial omens. His Akkadian name, Salbatanu,has
no known meaning or etymology.20Learned Babylonian commentaries have explained this name as 'He who keeps plague constant' by breaking up the name into its syllabic components and interpreting these syllables in Sumerian, thus arriving at the assumed Akkadian reading Mustabarrumutanu.21 The names of most planets have no identifiable meaning in either Sumerian or Akkadian, neither the just mentioned name of Mars, Salbatanu, nor Jupiter's most common name SAG.ME.GAR(see note 9); nor the name of Venus, written Dilbat(preferablyto be read Dele-batfollowing the Greek transcription Delephat).No clear etymology or explanation exists for the Akkadian or Sumerian word for 'planet'itself. In Greek, planetes are the 'errantones' because they roam the sky amidst the fixed stars; the Akkadian word for planet, bibbu,'wild sheep,' may also refer to their irregular movement.22
19References to this prediction from lunar omens have been collected by
Francesca Rochberg-Halton, in A ScientificHumanist. Studies in Memoryof
AbrahamSachs,ErieLeichty,M. deJ.Ellis, P. Gerardi,eds. (Philadelphia: The
University Museum, 1988) 323-28. The omen also appears as apodosis of a
liver omen, RA 65 (1971)73:62, cited CADN p. 266, as also noted by M. Stol, BibliothecaOrientalis47 (1990) 375, and in a celestial omen on solar eclipses,
with the name of Mars replaced by MUL.UDU.BA'Dplanet,'AChSamas 8:62.
20 Even the correctreading of the polyvalent signs NI = sal and BE = bat with which the name is customarily written has only recently been con
firmed with the help of a spelling sa-al-ba-ta-nu, in the liver omen cited in the preceding note, see Jean Nougayrol, RA 65 (1971) 82 ad line 62.

22 The Sumerian word which is equated with bibbu,UDU.BAD,also con
tains the word 'sheep' (UDU), but the second element, the polyvalent sign
BAD,once thought to have the reading idim'wild,' has recently been found
glossed til, in the gloss to line 34 of TabletXI of HAR-ra = hubullu,which
lists hides, among them [KUS.U]DU.BA(Dgloss: [u]-du-ti-il) = masakbi-ib-bi; see MSL 7 124:34,and for the gloss, MSL 9 197.Since in Sumerian til means
'finished' or 'complete,' the once assumed meaning 'wild sheep' for the Sumerian word is no longer tenable.

But of all the planets it was the Moon that was of the greatest
importance to the Babylonians. It was the Moon, from its first
sighting to its last, that regulated the calendar,which was based
on lunar months. The Moon is a "Fruit, lord of the month,"23
constantlyrenewing himself, as his epithet eddesu'ever-renewing'
stresses. The Moon's waxing and waning does not determine
a stronger or weaker influence on, say, the growing of crops as
it does in Hellenistic astrology, but its phases signal the timing
of various ritual acts. The Moon god, Sin, the father of both Sa
mas (the Sun) and Istar,is a male deity, not the Selene or Luna
of the Greeks and Romans, but he still has an affinity with
women magicians, sorceresses who are able to "drawdown the
Moon" (see ChapterVI). The eclipse of the Moon, in particular,
remained a terrifying event, whose dire predictions had to be
averted by penitential rites,24including, under the Sargonid
kings in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., the installation
of a substitute king. This substitute king reigned for one hun
dred days and was then put to death, thus taking upon himself
the misfortune and death portended for the king.25
Sun, Moon, and Venus, represented by their emblems the
sundisk, the lunar crescent, and the eight-pointed star,are com
monly depicted on monuments-steles, boundary stones-as
guardians of the provisions sworn to in the treaty or deed
recorded therein. The influence of these stellar deities on man is twofold: they
are both the origin of ills that beset him and the beneficent
powers that can be made favorably disposed toward a suppli
cant. They may cause affliction, exerting nefarious influence on
their own or through sorcerers' manipulations, and they may
herald ill fortune by their motions and configurations that are
recorded in the extensive collection of celestial omens.
However, through proper prayers and rituals the stars'
influence can avert the portended misfortune and assist the
exorcist and the physician in healing illness.

INTRODUCTION
Astral magic and the role of astral deities have been amply
studied in connection with Hellenistic Egypt and the corpus of
Hermetic texts and magical papyri originating in Egypt.26The
cuneiform evidence from Mesopotamia has been largely
neglected by Assyriologists, and has been at the most utilized
at second hand by other scholars who had to rely on often inex
actly edited Babylonian sources. But even if comparison with
neighboring civilizations had not so suggested, the power
attributed to the heavenly bodies and their significance and
impact according to the Babylonians' conception in their cos
mology should have been evident from such Mesopotamian
images as the poetic phrase "writing of heaven" (sitir same or
sitir burume) applied to the starry sky,27 and from King
Esarhaddon's remark that he depicted on steles "lumasu-stars
which represent the writing of my name."28Uncertain is the
reference, unfortunately still opaque, to the "reading" or
"meaning" of Assurbanipal's name that was revealed in a
dream to Gyges, king of Lydia.29
Poetic texts are also the firstto adumbrate how the moon and the stars give signs and warnings to men, even before the art
of celestial divination had assumed the status of a scholarly dis
cipline. The so-called "Kingof Battle"(sartamhari),an Old Baby
lonian poem dealing with the exploits of King Sargon of Akkad
26 Garth Fowden, The EgyptianHermes:a historicalapproachto the late
paganmind(Cambridge:CambridgeUniversity Press, 1986)can be consulted
for earlier references. 27 See CAD S/3 p. 146 s.v.; cited (after Zimmern) already by Franz
Dornseiff, Das Alphabetin Mystik und Magie, Stoicheia Heft 7 (Leipzig and
Berlin: Teubner, 1922) 89f.
28 lumdsesitir sumiya, Borger, Esarh. p. 28:11, lumasi tams'l sitir sumiya,
Borger,Esarh.p. 27 Ep. 40:9. An attempt at correlating this phrase with the
symbols depicted on the stone monument was made by D. D. Luckenbill,
"The Black Stone of Esarhaddon,"AmericanJournalof SemiticLanguages41
(1924-25) 165-73; see also, with reference to Sargon's use of the phrase,
C. J. Gadd, Ideasof Divine Rule in the AncientEast, The Schweich Lectures
of the British Academy 1945 (London, 1948) 93-95.
29 See for this episode Mordechai Cogan and Hayim Tadmor, "Gyges
and Ashurbanipal,"Or.NS 46 (1977)75, though they, by preferringthe manu
script tradition which writes nibitsarrutiya'the mention of my kingship' over
nibtt sumiya 'the "reading" of my name,' divorce this occurrence from the
other occurrences of this well-attested phrase.

stars came forth for the enemy,31 a celestial portent that must
refer to a solar eclipse during which the stars became visible,
an event that was evidently to be interpreted as the stars por
tending victory for Sargon against his enemy.
Allusions to celestial portents given to Sargon appear in liver
omens, the earliest recorded mode of divination, which is at
tested long before celestial omens were collected and codified.
A particular configuration of the sheep's liver is said to refer to
King Sargon of Akkad as one who "traversed darkness and
light came out for him."32This description must record an
eclipse occurring under Sargon, in spite of its peculiar phrase
ology; indeed, omens from lunar eclipses were the first to be
committed to writing, possibly as early as 1800 B.C.33 More

important, Sargon's later namesake, Sargon II of Assyria, also
records, no doubt intentionally referring to his illustrious
predecessor's example, that a lunar eclipse portended victory
for him on his campaign against Urartu in 714 B.C.34
Portents from lunar and solar eclipses, as well as from other
lunar, solar, stellar, and meteorological phenomena eventually
were collected and more or less standardized in the omen collection called from its incipit EnumaAnu Enlil'When Anu (and)
Enlil' comprising seventy books (Akkadian: "tablets"35)along
with various excerpts from these and commentaries to them.36
But while these prognostications provided warnings for king
and country-though rarely for an individual-the stars and
planets were not thought to affect man's destiny by their direct
influence, as they were in Greek horoscopic astrology. In Otto
Neugebauer's words:

include predictionsfor individuals,based on planetarypositions

in the signs of the zodiacand on their mutualconfigurations.In
this latest and most significantmodificationastrology became
knownto the Greeksin the Hellenisticperiod.Butwith the excep
tion of some typical Mesopotamian relics the doctrine was
changedin Greekhandsto a universalsystemin whichformalone
it could spreadall overthe world.Hence astrologyin the modern
sense of the term,with its vastly expandedset of "methods"is a
trulyGreekcreation,in manyrespectsparallelto the development
of Christiantheology a few centurieslater.37
Yet besides Greek deterministic astrology, that is, geneth
lialogy, or horoscopic astrology, to which the quoted strictures
of Neugebauer apply, and Mesopotamian omen literaturewith
which he contrasted it, there exist areas in which the Babylo
nians acknowledged the influence of the stars.These are, firstly,
catarchicastrology,which endeavors to find the most auspicious
moment for commencing an undertaking; secondly, belief in
the stars'power to imbue ordinarysubstances with supernatural,
magic effectiveness, which I discuss in Chapters II and III;and
thirdly, the apotropaic and prophylactic application of astral
influence, both benefic and malefic, especially in the machina
tions of black magic, insofar as stars can protect from and avert
the evil wrought by sorcerersor portended by an ominous sign.
Cuneiform sources reveal how the Babylonians conceived the
celestial bodies, what power they attributedto them, what they
expected to obtain through these powers, and what were the
means they used to gain their influence. Documentation for
these concerns is found not so much in the literaturethat concerns itself with celestial omens but in the scientific writings of
the Mesopotamian intellectuals. These writings include, in
addition to fields that are generally acknowledged as science
today, such as medicine, others that are not, such as divination
and various activities around it. Much new material can be
found in the recently reexamined correspondence of Assyrian
and Babylonian scholars in the letters they addressed to the
kings of Assyria in the eighth and seventh centuries,38and in
their reports on astronomical observations which include pre

dictions based on the phenomena observed as well as the
means to avert portended evil.39We may follow them in mak
ing no distinction between scientific astronomy and magic
operations.
Parallels with beliefs and practices of the Hellenistic world,
as I try to show in these pages, strengthen my claim of the uses
made of the astral powers; Mesopotamian sources not custom
arily adduced for the history of culture may thereby add their
evidence to the history of magic, especially astral magic.

CHAPTER I
The Role of Stars
Stars function in a dual role in relation to man: they exert a
direct influence and serve as mediators between man and god.
Directly, through astral irradiation, they transform ordinary
substances into potent ones that will be effective in magic, medi
cine, or ritual, as materiamedica, amulets, or cultic appurte
nances. Stars also provide reliable answers to the query of the
diviner. More important, in their second role stars are man's
medium of communication with the divine. The role of the stars as mediators emerges from the descrip
tions given in Mesopotamian poetry. For poetry can be found
not only in the much-anthologized pieces from Gilgames and
other myths or epic tales, or in the hymns and prayers of the
official cult that have from early on attractedattention and com
parison with the psalms of the Old Testament. It is often
hidden in the scientific texts, those that constitute the corpus
of the professional exorcist and diviner, disdained by the .sci
entist and dismissed as boring by the literary historian.
The mediating role of the stars- not unlike the role of saints
is most clearly stated in the prayerof the supplicant to the Yoke
star, approximately our Bootes, in an apotropaic ritual against
mistakes occurring while executing temple offices:
Yokestarstandingat the right,Yokestarstandingat the left,
the god sends you to man, and man to the god,
(andnow)I sendyou to (mypersonal)god who eatsmyfood-offering,
drinksmy water(libation),
acceptsmy incense offering.40

Stars are messengers who are to take the supplicant's prayer
to the deity, as in:
may the staritself taketo you (goddess)my misery;
let the ecstatic4t1ell you, the dream-interpreterrepeatto you,
let the (three)watchesof the night speak to you . . 42
Other stars of the night sky appear in a like role. Besides the
prayer to the Yoke star, the cited apotropaic ritual contains
appeals, first, to the "gods of the night," then to Venus, and
finally to the Pleiades, adjured to be at the supplicant's right,
and to the Kidney star, adjured to be at his left.43
Standby me, O Gods of the Night!
Heed my words, O gods of destinies,
Anu, Enlil,Ea, and all the greatgods!
I call to you, Delebat (i.e., Venus), Lady of battles (variant has:
Lady of the silence [of the night]),
I call to you, O Night, bride (veiled by?) Anu.
Pleiades, stand on my right, Kidney-star, stand on my left!
Of the several copies some preserve only the partial invoca
tion "[ . .] Pleiades, stand at my left, [I?send] you to the god
and goddess [who ate my food offering,] drank my water [liba
tion], [. . .] intercede for me!"44 Rare as such explicit state
41 The translation of the word "ecstatic" presupposes the reading zabbu
selected here, on account of its parallelism with sabru, 'interpreter of dreams.'
However, in the reading zappu, equally possible, the word means 'Pleiades'
and possibly this is what was originally meant. As for the parallel, sabru (or sapru), it does not refer, to my knowledge, to a star or constellation.

ments are, they shed light on other appeals that leave the mode
of the stars' intercession unspecified.
Just as the Sun sees all of the earth by day, so do the stars
by night. They are also often addressed with the same words:
"Youwho see the entire world."45Rarely do we find, however,
prayers of such elaborateness as those whose title designates
them as "lifting-of-the-hand,"46a name referring to the appro
priateprayergesture accompanying them. Such prayersarepre
scribed in the elaborate rituals,47often extending over several
days, intended to purify the temple or the king. Our knowl
edge of the existence of some of the prayers to stars comes
solely from the listing of their incipits in these ritual texts.
Lifting-of-the-hand prayers to the constellations Wagon
(Ursa Maior), True Shepherd of Anu48 (Orion), the Pleiades,49
the Scorpion50 (Scorpius), and to the Arrow Star51(Sirius) are
known.52 That the planets Venus and Jupiter were invoked is
known from incipits of lifting-of-the-hand prayers, but it is not
avert the evil portended by a mistake committed while serving in a temple
office (HULGARZA),see Caplice, Or.NS 39 (1970)124f.; a further duplicate

known whether they were addressed as deities or planets,
while surviving prayers to Mars53show that he was addressed
both under his planetary name Salbatanuand as the deity,
Nergal, whose astral manifestation Mars is. Ambiguity obtains
of course in prayers addressed to the Moon, whose name Sin
applies equally to the Moon god and to the Moon as one of the
seven planets. Lifting-of-the-hand prayers are also addressed,
collectively, simply to "stars,"or "all stars"54often called "gods
of the night. 55
Unequivocally astralnames are used in the treaties that Esar
haddon concluded with the vassals of Assyria to secure the
rights of succession of his son Assurbanipal; they were put
under the protection of not only the majorgods Samas, Sin, and
Istar, who are elsewhere too identified with Sun, Moon, and
the planet Venus, but also of other astral deities. Thus Jupiter
introduces the list of six astral deities in Esarhaddon's Succession Treaty,the other five being Venus, Saturn, Mercury,Mars,
and Sirius, in this order.56Similarly, Jupiter precedes Sirius57
in another treaty58which is known only from its mention in a
letter of Esarhaddon's son Samas-sumu-ukin.59 The treaties concluded in Anatolia between the kings of the Hittites and
their neighbors some six hundred years earlier were also put

THE ROLE OF STARS
under the protection of the planets and stars, particularly of
Venus, called "resplendent Istar (variant: Venus)"60as well as
of the storm god and such cosmic powers as mountains and
rivers, and of the "gods of the nether world" for which a variant
substitutes Ereskigal, the queen of the nether world.61 The
appeal to Babylonian deities in their astral manifestation can
still be found in Syriac magic texts.62
Invocations to stars are not necessarily long and elaborate.
A few lines, often a few words suffice to state the petitioner's
appeal. In extreme cases, divine favor is requested by a simple
enumeration of star names beside names of gods, natural
forces, and other entities such as the days of the month, in a
litany-like sequence, as in the type of text composed to gain
absolution that I have called lipsurlitanies from their kenning
lipsur 'may absolve.'63For example, in one such litany64an
enumeration of various gods is followed by "Gods of the night,
Pleiades, Virgo, Orion, Jupiter?,"and the names of the rivers
Tigris, Euphrates, and other rivers.65
Of all the stars, it is Sirius that is especially often addressed,
both under its stellar name 'Arrow,'6a6nd as the star's divine manifestation, the god Ninurta. The hymnic invocation "Arrow

some in Sumerian and others in Akkadian,68known under the title HUL.BA.ZI.ZI'Begone, Evil!, literally "Evil (HUL)Be
gone (BA.ZI.ZI)."6T9he last incantation of the collection con
jures the evil in the name of Jupiter,the Pleiades, and the god
Irragal:"Be conjured by the powerful, fearsome, brilliant Jupi
ter, by the Pleiades and Irragal,let 'any evil' not come close."70
A magic effect is sought by praying to a deity called First
born of Emah:
O First-bornof Emah,First-bornof Emah,you arethe eldest son
of Enlil YoudescendedfromEkur,and you standin the middleof the sky
with the Wagon.71
The stellar nature of the divine being addressed is evident
from the second line, where he is described as standing in the
middle of the sky, with the Wagon star.As for the astronomical
identity of the "First-bornof Emah,"such a star, described as
"first-born son of Anu," is listed in an astronomical compendium from about 1000 B.C.72 as the star that stands in the
"rope" of the Wagon,73and has been identified with the Pole

THE ROLE OF STARS
Star. A prayer to it is prescribed in the hemerology for the
month of Ululu (month VI).74
But the First-born of Emah is also a deity, since he is
addressed as the son of Enlil, one of the three supreme gods,
whose temple Ekurin the ancient city of Nippur is the earthly
counterpartof, we assume, a celestial Ekurin one of the heavens
where the gods dwell. Some descriptions of the heavens speak
of seven heavens, and some of three only, each made of a differ
ent precious stone.75
It is noteworthy that the address to the "First-bornof Emah"
appears in a medical text in which remedy for toothache is
sought from the "first-bornof the Mountain, Marduk";it is to
be recited in connection with a ritual that includes fashioning
a clay model of a jaw with the aching tooth. The "Mountain"
is an epithet of the god Enlil, and so far the two appeals to the
"first-bornof the Mountain"and to the "First-bornof Emah, ... the eldest son of Enlil" seem to be identical, except that, of
course, Marduk is not the son of Enlil, but of Ea, the third god
of the supreme triad, the god of the subterranean waters and
also the god of cunning.
The reason for addressing the deity of a particular celestial
body is not normally stated, and can be inferred in obvious and
lonischenFixsternhimme(lHeidelberg, 1913)43, identified it with Polaris(pres
ently a, in c. 1000B.C.,(3Ursae Minoris, see F.X. Kugler,SternkundeundStern
dienstin Babel.Erganzungenzum erstenund zweitenBuch [Miinster, 1913]57).
The identification is partly based on the occurrence in Astrolabe B iii 11. The
star is mentioned in the so-called "Stevenson Omen Text"(Babyloniaca7 231
= pl. XVII)ii 4 and 5: summa UL.DUMU.US.E.MAsHa UL.MAR.GiD.DAGAL

the First-born of E.MAH, (part) of the Great Wagon, approaches Jupiter,
there will be pestilence; if ditto recedes, there will be famine.' A variant of
the star's name, DUMU.USAN.MAH,would mean 'First-bornof Lofty Anu,'

trivial cases only. Thus, for example, the prayer to Mars in his
manifestation as the god Nergal (the god of the plague) was to
be recited by the Babylonian king Samas-sumu-ukin, the son
of Esarhaddon, mentioned above, during a plague epidemic.76
Rarely is reference made to phenomena most characteristicof
the celestial body, such as the eclipse of the moon.77 Only in
the Hymn to the Sun78 is there an allusion, clad in poetic
terms, to the sun's daily course and yearly cycle, reflecting the
Babylonians' characteristicpreoccupation with calendric mat
ters, a preoccupation that also surfaces in the description of the
creation of the cosmos in TabletVI of the Poem of the Creation, also known, from its incipit, as Enumaelis.
Some prayers'are written, it appears, in the Sumerian lan
guage, but in factare simple transpositions of Akkadian phrase
ology into Sumerian words and phrases. They may have been
recited-as in various rituals-by the priest or exorcist utraque
lingua eruditus79while the client's prayer was couched in the
vernacular, Akkadian. Such a prayer,to be recited three times
to avert "anyevil"80from a baby, appeals to 'Ninmah, standing
in the sky, mistress of all lands'81and to the stars standing at
the right and the left.82The "mistress" is probably Venus the
morning star, and the prayer is to be recited before sunrise,83
and is followed by a fragmentaryprayerto the Sun, Samas; with
this the tablet breaks off. Wethus envisage a dawn ceremony in

which the morning star Venus was addressed, followed by a
sunrise ceremony. Prayersto Venus as morning star, addressed
as a female deity, are attested through the Middle Babylonian
personal name Ina-niphisa-alsis 'I called to her at her rising.'84
The unnamed star addressed as "Youhave risen, star, you
are the first one"85no doubt also is Venus, this time, as the masculine gender of the pronoun and the adjective indicate, as
evening star.
Lovers too turn to Venus, the planet of the goddess of love,
Istar. Their prayer is addressed to the goddess, but her astral
character is evident from her epithet "luminary of heaven"86
and from the sacrifices to Istar-of-the-Stars.87 The ritual directs: "you set up a reed altar before Istar-of-the-Stars, you
make offerings"88and, having prepared six times two figurines,
"you burn (them) before Istar-of-the-Stars."89
A "woman whose husband is angry with her"90recites a

charm is one of the few love charms spoken by women to recon
quer their lovers, best known from Theocritus' Second Idyll
and Virgil'sEighth Eclogue, while in the Greek magical papyri
it is men who desire to secure the love of women. The reference to Venus is indubitable, even though the first few words in the
pertinent ritual are broken,93 since the prayer addresses the
star?(the word is broken) of the morning.94
To Venus also, as Istar-of-the-Stars,turns the exorcist before
administering the potion to the love-stricken patient.95Most
often, however, it is the multitude of stars, the entire starrysky,
and not a particular planet or constellation that is invoked. A
ritual designed to have the king triumph over his enemies96is
performed "before all?stars,"9 i7t is accompanied by the recita
tion of a prayer addressed to the stars of the night.98The next
ritual99prescribes the fashioning of two figurines holding the
lance and the scepter (the royal insignia) but clothed in
everyday garments, the making of offerings to Ursa Maior, and
the burying of the figurines in enemy territory. A possibly
related ritual for diverting the enemy from the homeland is a
fragmentary text in which the names of the gods to whom the
prayer is addressed are not preserved, only the epithets
'Brightly shining gods, (you who are?) judges.'00 How the
stars responded to such appeals, and how they exerted their
influence upon earthly matters, will be the subject of the fol
lowing chapters dealing with such areas affecting man as medi
cine, herbalistry, and both apotropaic and noxious magic.

Among the many "firsts" that can be attributed to the
Mesopotamians?10we may certainly count the first herbals
and the first lapidaries, and a case may be made for the first
bestiary too. The cuneiform handbooks can be compared to
their later counterparts because they already exhibit their char
acteristic structure, and go beyond simple enumerations of
stones and herbs we see in the Egyptian Onomastica.102Such
simple lists were among the very first documents written in
Mesopotamia or indeed anywhere. The organizing principle
they exhibit is due to the character of the cuneiform writing
system.
In the Sumerian writing system names of members
belonging to a class are preceded by a class mark, called "deter
minative,"that indicates their nature; only in a few classes does
the determinative follow. Names of professions and other
human classes, as well as bodily characteristicsor deformities,
are preceded by the word for 'man' written with the sign lu;

of textiles and clothing by the word for 'wool' (sig), 'linen'
(gada), or 'cloth' (tug); of cities, rivers, and other geographical
units by the appropriate determinative; similarly, objects made
of wood, stone, clay, reed, etc., are preceded by a class mark
indicating the nature of the item: the word for 'wood,' 'stone,'
'clay,''reed,' etc. Names of garden plants, birds, and fish are,
however, followed by their respective class marks sar, musen,
and ku6. The earliest lists written in cuneiform, as early as the third
millennium, simply catalogue objects or living beings; the prin
ciple of classification is obviously semantic, based on the pres
ence of the determinative and therefore seemingly acrographic,
that is, the items are grouped according to the first sign used
to write them. Consequently, in any list, objects belonging to
a particular class are listed together, and the classification
according to the determinative doubles as a topical arrange
ment. This principle is useful for mnemotechnical and didactic
purposes and at the same time displays a classification of the
world, a feature that may be taken, with von Soden, as a sign
of the intellectual curiosity of the Mesopotamian man.103Sim
ilarly complex is the structure of the much later, late antique
and medieval, collections of lists and glossaries.104
These Sumerian unilingual lists were eventually provided
with an additional column of Akkadian translations, but their
sequence remained the "acrographic"principle displayed by
the Sumerian. The best known such bilingual lists, consisting of a Sumerian
column and a corresponding Akkadian column, form part of
the series known, from its incipit, as HAR-ra= hubullu,a com
pendium of twenty-odd chapters enumerating objects of the
physical world. To these lists a later commentary (called HAR
gud) adds a third column, also in Akkadian, which gives alter
native translations, usually by substituting more common

words for terms of the second column that had become obso
lete, without thereby changing the sequence or purpose of
these lists. In certain cases the third column contains not just
another equivalent or synonym, but an attempt at scholia;for
example "Egyptian squash" to a variety of squash listed in
Tablet XXIII10o5r "mourning garment" to explain the poetic
word karruin TabletXIX.106 Among the chapters107of HAR-ra = hubullu, the XVIIth,
incompletely preserved, deals with plants. In it, the acro
graphic principle applies in the first section, where each plant
name begins with the Sumerian word u, 'herb' In the second
section, the names are not preceded by t, but followed by sar,
'plant/ the postposed class markfor such garden plants as vege
tables, and other cultivated plants. Note that Greek too makes
a distinction between poTadvr'lsimple' (medicinal plant) and
)acavov 'vegetable.108
Within a section no classificatory principle is discernible,
except that varieties of the same species, whether botanically
accurately classified or not, are by orthographic necessity
enumerated together, as for example the alliaceae, whose
names in Sumerian are composed with the element sum 'garlic'
and a descriptive element, such as sum.sag.dili 'one-headed
garlic'109while the Akkadian name is turu or the cucurbita
ceae, whose names are composed with uku 'squash' and a
descriptive element, e.g., ukus.sir.gudwith Akkadian equivalent
iski alpi 'ox-testicle (squash)'110 These lists continued to serve
as pedagogical tools for learning Sumerian.

A more practicalpurpose was served by a work composed of
four or possibly more chapters (again called "tablets")known
from its incipit as Uruanna= mastakalor,for short, Uruanna.The
two columns of this list place side by side two plant names.
Sometimes the left-side entry is a Sumerian name and the right
side one its Akkadian equivalent as in the cited incipit; in other
instances severalleft-side entries, either Sumerian or Akkadian,
are equated with one (usually Akkadian) name. The explana
tion sometimes is a name that simply gives the indication: herb
for snake bitelll (compare our "cough drop" or the trade name
"After-Bite")or the plant is compared to another, better known
plant or even, though more rarely,warrants a brief description
quite similar to the entries in the Herbal (see p. 30). Sometimes
to the term in the right-hand side is added the remark "in
Subarian," "in Elamite," or "in Kassite," to specify that the
name in the left column comes from one or another of the for
eign languages of the areas surrounding Mesopotamia.
Uruanna could thus serve as a pharmaceutical handbook,
used to look up Sumerian and other foreign names, and may
also have served to indicate what herb could be substituted for
another. The pharmaceutical as opposed to purely lexical char
acter can also be inferred by the inclusion in the list of other
pharmacological substances, such as minerals (including
salts), insects, and oils.
Eventually,however, presumably around 1000B.C., a different
type of list was composed, a treatise that might more properly
be called a precursor of herbals; in the Assyriological literature
it usually goes under such a name as a "pharmaceuticalhand
book," or "vade mecum of the physician." The ancient Baby
lonians simply called it DUB.U.HI.A'tablet about/on herbs.'112

Sumerian or Akkadian, of the plant; the second, the indica
tion, that is, the symptoms or name of the disease it is sup
posed to counteract; and the third, the mode of application:
how it is to be prepared (e.g., ground, diluted in beer) and how
it is to be administered (e.g., as a potion, a salve, a lotion). The
arrangement follows the middle column so that the herbs are
grouped according to the disease they are good for; this layout
is convenient for finding the remedies for a particular ailment
by simply going down the middle column of the list.
For example: Yellow saffron : for constricted bladder : to
chop, to administer as a potion in fine beer; Kanis-acorn : for
the same : to chop, to administer as a potion in fine beer; Garlic
: for the same: to chop, to administer as a potion in oil or fine
beer;113Pistachio-herb : herb for the lungs : to chop, to admin
ister as a potion without eating;114Dog's tongue : herb for
cough : to press out its juice and administer as a potion.115
This "vade mecum" has a counterpart that deals with stones,
also simply called DUB.NA4.MES'tablet about/on stones';116
nevertheless, these compilations are only partially comparable
to those of the late herbals and lapidaries.
The type of text that seems truly the precursor of the
medieval handbooks is the one that I will call the sikinsutype,
from the opening words. Three such handbooks are known,
one (abnusikinsu) dealing with stones and minerals, another
one (sammusikinsu) with herbs, and a third (seru sikinsu), of
which only a small fragment survives, with snakes. These
three books thus represent the three categories lapidaries,
herbals, and bestiaries, of which latter the snake book is pos
sibly the sole surviving chapter.
All three handbooks evince a common structure. Each entry
begins the description with the word sikinsu, a word not easy
to translate if we consider its literal meaning alone: the word
siknu may mean "appearance, looks, character,"and the like;
113 BAM 1 i 26-28. 14 BAM 1 ii 24; see note 197.
115 Ibid. ii 35. A text published by Rene Labat, "La pharmacopee au ser
vice de la piete'" Semitica3 (1950)5-18, prescribes the use of herbs and other
ingredients in order to secure divine favoras well as to avertevil and illness.

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
the possessive suffix -su, 'its, points back to the antecedent
(abnu'stone' sammu'herb,'or seru 'snake'). If we take our cue
from handbooks of a later period, we may choose the English
term "nature,"simply because medieval texts begin the descrip
tion with this word (either with natura,if in Latin, or with the
form equivalent to naturain the Romance language used).17
And so we may translate the opening words as "the nature of
the herb (stone, snake) is."
What these handbooks lack are the illustrations of the later herbals.'18 The absence of illustrations is only partly due to
the nature of the writing and the writing material;illustrations,
even though only rarely and mostly in schematic drawing, do
appear on liver models and in some divinatory texts and on
some clay tablets inscribed with liver omens to illustrate marks
on the liver or lungs,119or with physiognomic omens to illus
trate drawings on the forehead or the hand, omens that may be
taken as remote precursors of metoposcopy120and chiromancy.
There exist sketches to indicate the emplacement of parapher
nalia in rituals and, even more rarely,in magic texts, as models
of figures to be drawn.121 In lieu of illustrations, descriptions,
often very precise, have to serve: they are couched, as in later
herbals, in terms of the plant's resemblance to and difference
from other plants with which it is compared.122
For example, "The herb whose nature is like the amhara
plant's, (but) its leaves are small, and it has no milky sap, its
117Forexample, "Lanatura del pavon es aital ... ,""Lanatura de la fur
micz es aital . . " Der waldensische Physiologus, ed. Alfons Mayer, Roma
nische Forschungen5 (1890) 390-418, nos. 4 (Pavon) and 42 (De la furmicz).
118Illustrations appear late also in Byzantine, Arabic, and other later
herbals.

seed resembles linseed, that plant is called labubitu.The herb
whose nature is like that of the amhara-plant's,but its seed is
red like that of the abulilu-plant, that herb is called [ . .], it
is good for removing paralysis; to dry, to crush, and to apply
as a salve (mixed) in oil."123 Or: "The herb's nature is: its thorn is like the thorn of cress, its leaves are as large as cress leaves, that herb is called namhara,
whoever drinks it will die."124 An even more detailed description runs: "The herb's nature
is like that of the 'dog's tongue,' or, according to a second
source, like the haltappanu-herb;its leaves are long, its fruit is
like the Adad-squash,125it grows tall, its seed, like the tubaqu
plant's, is divided(?)126in three: that herb is called sunazi, and
in the language of Hatti they call it tubaqanu[that is, the tubiqu
like herb]; it is good for scorpion sting; its mode of preparation:
to dry, to crush, to administer as a potion in beer."127
Obviously, these descriptions arevery much like those found
not only in herbals such as Dioscorides,128but also in the
spells collected in Hellenistic magical papyri, written in
Greek129or in Demotic, as in "The ivy-it grows in gardens; its
leaf is like the leaf of a shekamplant, being divided into three

blossom is like silver (another [manuscript] says gold).'130
Some of the more exotic names raise the question whether
names designating parts of the body of animals that are listed
among the pharmakaactually refer to animal substances or are
to be taken as descriptive names of plants, as the "dog'stongue"
in the previous quote, a literal translation from Akkadian,131
equivalent-in name at least-to cynoglossum. R. Campbell
Thompson thought that "The Assyrian was as ready to call
what was almost certainly opium by name of 'lion fat' (liptnesi)
or 'human fat' (lipiameliti) or castor oil as 'the blood of a black
snake' (damisiri salmi) as later alchemists were to give ridicu
lous synonyms for mercury, cinnabar, cadmia, and such."132
That some of the strange names were indeed used to refer
to plants is shown by an often quoted passage from the Greek magical papyri:133
Because of the masses' eagernessto practicemagic, the temple
scribesinscribedthe names of the herbs and otherthings which
they employed,on the statuesof the gods, so thatthe masses, as
a consequence of their misunderstanding,might not practice
magic.... Butwe havecollectedthe explanations[ofthese names]
frommanycopies [of the sacredwritings],all of them secret.
Here they are:
A snake'shead: a leech.
Bloodof a snake:haematite. Lionsemen: human semen.

Yet, we might question whether these terms were indeed
used as "secret"names, as the papyrus indicates. The use of
"secret"or "cover"names (German: "Decknamen") is not nec
essarily intended to keep the craft or learning from the unini
tiated or, in case of a lucrativeprofession, from the competition.
Complicated and rare words and spellings may simply attest
to the sophistication of the writer, and enhance his reputation.
The practice may be comparable to the use of outlandish sign
values in a Middle Babylonian glass text, once thought to have
been used to safeguard professional secrets.135
Still, late herbals speak of these substances as if they indeed
were animal (see note 110). Other plant names are less fanciful,
even though they may betray wishful thinking: imhuresra 'it
cures twenty'-that is, twenty ailments, and even imhur-limu
'it cures a thousand,' just as in Hungarian there is an herb called
ezerj6fiu',thousand-good-herb.'The German Tausendgiildenkraut,
literally 'thousand-gold-pieces-herb,' on the other hand, seems
to be a calque on Latin centaurium(compare English centaury),
etymologized as 'hundred' (centum) 'gold pieces' (aurum).136
The name of the herb centaury (Greek KEvTa6pltov)is said to
derive from the word Centaur, so named after the centaur Chiron, who healed his wound with it.137

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
In ancient natural histories it is often added to the descrip
tion of the plant that the species comes in two sexes: male and
female, as the above cited poligonon(see note 128). These des
ignations have nothing to do with the plant's sex essential for
propagation, but refer to its potency. This is evident from the
fact that stones too-that is, beads of semi-precious stones
come in both masculine and feminine varieties; this was known in Greek literaturesince Theophrastus (end of the 4th c.
B.C.) but, like many small and perhaps insignificant details of
the transmission of beliefs and knowledge, harks back to Baby
lonian sources. Not only Classical authors138noted this divi
sion but modern jewelers as well.139The division of materia
medicainto masculine and feminine is well known from Greek
and Latin authors; according to commentators, among them
Pliny the Elder, masculine herbs are stronger and more
effective than the feminine ones. Note mascula tura "male incense" in Virgil,140explained by the commentator as mascula
tura,idestfortia"male incense, hence stronger."14I1n Babylonian

medical texts the substance UB.PAD(to be read probably uppattu
or upputtu)comes in male and female varieties.142
Sometimes the etymology of the name is transparent. While
'sunflower' (u.UTU sammi samas) probably describes any
heliotrope, that is, a flower that always looks at the sun: "the
flower of Samas that faces the setting of the sun,"143other
names composed with a name of a god or goddess are more
suggestive. We do not know to what botanical species for
example the herb called "Ninurta's aromatic" (Sumerian sim.
dNinurta,equated in Akkadian with nikiptu)14r4efers, both vari
eties of which, masculine and feminine, are mentioned in
recipes; however, the name of the herb called sim.dIshara',aro
matic of the goddess Ishara,'which is equated with Akkadian
qunnabu,'cannabis'145may indeed conjure up an aphrodisiac
through the association with Ishara, goddess of love, and also
calls to mind the plant named ki.naIstar,in Akkadian suhsi Istar
or majalIgtar,both meaning 'bed of Istar'
The pharmaceutical lists, whether of the Uruanna or the
sikinsutype, provide the physician or the pharmacist with the
knowledge about the appropriate herb to be used for a partic
ular ailment. However, it is important to know not only your
roots and herbs, and what they are good for but also the proper
time and manner for picking the herb, or digging up the root,
so as to maximize its healing power and, not least, to guard
against the evil consequences of your acts. Then, and perhaps
most important, one has to know the proper time to administer
the medicine, by selecting an astrologicallypropitious moment.
A sixteenth-century doctor urged: "Above all things next to
grammar a physician must have surely his Astronomye, to
know how, when and at what time every medicine ought to be administered."146

The rules and precautions to be followed at the gathering
of a plant are not set out in the pharmaceutical handbooks;
they have to be culled from prescriptions in medical texts and
some rituals. The directions given to the herbalist are very
similar to those observed by the 'root-cutter'(the literal trans
lation of Greek rhizotomosi)n antiquity,in the Middle Ages, and
in folk medicine, as collected in Armand Delatte's Herbarius,147 to which these examples from Mesopotamia may serve as supplement:
(Lookfor) a gourdwhich growsalone in the plain;
when the Sun has gone down,
coveryour head with a kerchief,
coverthe gourdtoo, drawa magiccirclewith flouraroundit,
and in the morning,beforethe Sun comes out,
pull it up fromits location,
take its root .. .148
These instructions specify the time for picking the plant, and
the precautions to be observed in regard to both the plant
and the herbalist. The scene is night (between sunset and sun
rise); the plant is isolated by a magic circle and covered; and
the herbalist protects himself by covering his head.
Nighttime may be specified in other ways: sometimes it is
sufficient to say that the sun must not "see" the herb: for
example, a root "which the sun did not see when you pulled

dug up."150Recall the Rootof hemlockdigg'di'the dark, as well as
. . . slips of yew
Sliver'din the moon'seclipse that the witches, in Macbetht,hrowinto theircaldron.151
Covering the plant and surrounding it with a magic circle are
necessary because the plant may not willingly give up the root,
leaf, or shoot needed for preparing the medicine; one must buy
it from the plant, or at least give some compensation for it.
Theophrastus notes, "Thatone should be bidden to pray while
cutting is not perhaps unreasonable, but the additions made
to this injunction are absurd: for instance, as to cutting the kind
of all-heal (panakes)one should put in the ground in its place
an offering made of all kind of fruits and a cake; and that, when
one is cutting gladwyn [Gk. ,ipi; = iris?], one should put in
its place to pay for it cakes of meal from spring-sown wheat,
and that one should cut it with a two-edged sword, first
making a circle round it three times. . ."152

present intended for you, now give me the plant of life.'154At
the very least, the herbalist must propitiate the plant by speak
ing a greeting or a prayer, for which I may again quote Pliny
(NH 25.145): "Some instruct the diggers [of the pimpernel] to
say nothing until they have saluted it before sunrise, and then
to gather it and extract the juice, for so they say its efficacy is
at its greatest."Even Christian monks recommended that while
gathering herbs it would be holy to speak the salutation:
All hail, thou holy herb,vervin,
Growingon the ground.155
The two-edged sword, or any other tool used, must not be
made of iron, a precaution that is well known from Classical
Greek and Latin texts, as can be seen from a passage in Pliny's
Natural History (24.103): "The plant called selago is gathered
without iron with the right hand, thrust under the tunic
through the left arm-hole, as though the gatherer were
thieving.'156The earliest attestation for this practice too comes
from Babylonia, as was recognized as early as 1941. The Baby
lonian herbalist, too, draws a circle around the herb, in the cited text157with flour; in other recipes with an instrument but
not with one made of iron. The precaution of approaching the
herb the head covered with a cloth and covering the plant itself
seems aimed at "blinding" the plant so that it does not recog

for yielding up their bounty (for offerings to plants, described in Pliny, see
the references collected by Delatte, Herbarius[note 147above]) but also other
participants in the magic actions: the claypit (kullatu)from which the clay

nize the herbalist.158The reference to "as though ... thieving"
also indicates that the gatherer of the herbs pretends to be
someone else, so as not to bring down upon himself the herb's
revenge, an evil from which the Babylonian herbalist would
have protected himself by an apotropaic ritual, but I know of
no such ritual. The plant "growing alone in the plain"or the "lone tamarisk"
is singled out already by its habitat;159other habitats are also
singled out as significant. Especially effective, apparently, are
plants growing on a grave (Akkadian kimahhu), as the texts
often specify: "root of camel thorn from a grave, root of an
acacia-shrub from a grave";16o0r "acacia-shrubwhich grew on
a grave."161 Compare:
Iubet sepulcriscaprificoserutas,
iubet cupressos funebris . . . aduri "(Canidia)orderswild figtreesuprootedfromthe tombs,funereal cypresses."162
Most efficacious are plants growing in the mountains; there
on the mountains' heights they are better exposed to the influ
ence of the stars, not only because they are closer to them but
also because the atmosphere is thinner.163Among addresses

to herbs whose healing properties are sought, several begin by
describing the plant as mountain-grown: "Theheartsease grows
in the mountains . . "164 Herbs can serve not only to heal but also to diagnose a con
dition. The patient's reaction to a medicine may very well indi
cate what his illness is and what the prognosis may be. Rare
as they are, the attestations of this diagnostic method indicate
that they may have been used more often than the extant texts
reveal. One of the few is a Babylonian medical text that testifies
to the use of a so-to-speak patch test. The sick man is bandaged
with a poultice made of ingredients that act as an irritantand
produce a blister.Afterhaving applied the poultice forthree days,
on the fourth day you remove it and inspect the blister that was
produced by the poultice. The color of the blister, whether it
is white, red, yellow, orblack, will predictthe course of the man's
illness: "if the blister is white, his intestines will quiet down;
if it is red, his intestines 'hold too much heat'; if it is green, (the
afflictionis due to) overexposureto sun; if it is black, the affliction
will cause him suffering and he will not live."165Only after the
diagnosis is made does the physician apply a medication to alle
viate the condition provoked.
A similar test is described in a recently found medical text
from Emar on the Euphrates:166"he chops? herbs for 'leprosy'
with a fig-tree branch, he grinds?figs and raisins and ties them
on in a bandage; on the next day at night he removes them, if
they are white, he replaces the bandage, on the third day he

A rare pregnancy testing text from Babylonia has also come
to light. Itwas used to test whether a woman is able to conceive.
The test consists of inserting a pessary made from medications
wrapped in a wad of wool, or of giving the woman a potion
to drink. If the potion causes her to vomit, she is pregnant; if
the wad of wool has turned green, she is pregnant. While sim
ilar tests had been known from Egyptian medicine, and they
have been compared with Classical parallels,167 the newly
identified Babylonian pregnancy test is the first Mesopotamian
example of this practice.168
The fame of Babylonian herbalists is attested in a ninth
century A.D. Arabic book, known as NabateanAgriculture,
which reports that certain medicinal plants were introduced by
Babylonian kings, whose names it lists.169In fact, we know
from Babylonian medical texts that certain salves170 and
strings of amulet stones were attributedto a famous king of the
past, for example, to Hammurapi, Naram-Sin, and Rim-Sin.171

CHAPTER III
Medicine
For when those who first wrote on the subject gave their
attention almost solely to meditation about the stars, and
believed natural philosophy and the healing art to be inti
mately connected with these heavenly bodies, they dis
seminated seeds of magic, from which that science grew
to such a degree that it over-spread the whole world with
its pollution.

The Taleof the PoorMan of Nippur, the earliest example173of
the folktale motif "The First Larrikin"best known from the Thousandand One Nights has often served to show that ancient
Mesopotamian literature too knew the physician as a comic
figure. This tale narrateshow a poor man, wronged by the cor
rupt mayor of the city of Nippur, takes his revenge by giving
the mayor three good thrashings for the one he received. He
administers the second thrashing in the garb of a doctor from
the city of Isin, under the pretense of tending the wounds that
he himself had inflicted when he thrashed the mayor in a
different disguise. Another humorous story, only recently pub
lished, The Tale of the IlliterateDoctor from Isin,174also pokes
fun at the medical profession represented here again by a phy
sician from Isin. He is depicted as an illiterate who, when invited to Nippur
to a banquet, cannot find his way to the house of his host be

cause he does not understand Sumerian, the elite language still
spoken by the inhabitants. Even the old woman on the street
corner who gives him directions is bilingual. She addresses
him in Sumerian but has to repeat everything she said in the
only language he knows, in Akkadian. The doctor's ignorance
of Sumerian, the language of learning, is as ridiculous as a
physician's ignorance of Latin would have been in the not-so
distant past. Through the person of the physician the story also
makes fun of the city of Isin itself, as famous in Mesopotamia
for its physicians and as synonymous with medicine as
medieval Salerno was to become. The most famous in the ancient world were of course the Egyptian physicians; so great
was their fame that their neighbors in Anatolia begged them
to come and provide treatment and medication, a topic that has
been amply treated by Egyptologists.l75
The two humorous tales that show that the physician was a
comic figure in Babylonian literaturejust as he was in Moliere
and still is-have contributed to rekindle the interest in Mesopo
tamian medicine. The study of Mesopotamian medicine has
also benefited from the upsurge of interest in the history of
ancient medicine,176and has attracted a number of Assyriolo
gists competent to deal with the original material. They con
tribute to collective works on the history of medicine177but in
the main their studies have focused on the identification of the diseases and of the materia medica used in the prescriptions.
This, however, is the area that is fraught with the greatest
difficulties, since we are rarely able to identify the substances
plants, minerals, and other matter-that enter as ingredients in
recipes, or even to give a precise translation of the symptoms

described. The conceptual advance represented by the struc
tural approach of Dietlinde Goltz178has remained largely
without following, as have the more philosophically oriented
studies of Lloyd; even though we no longer give credence to
Herodotus' report on the lack of physicians179or make fun of
the Babylonians' "Dreckapotheke."Herodotus' report that the
Babylonians bring their sick to the market in order to inquire
of passers-by what remedies they would suggest has served as
argument in the market-economy dispute more importantly
than in the history of medicine, and we realize that the Dreck
apothekewas a well-known pharmaceutical handbook of the
seventeenth century.180
Understanding Babylonian medicine is especially seriously
hampered by the character of the prescriptions, as they
nowhere explain the reasons for the treatment indicated nor
the property of the ingredient that recommends its use.
In this respect the medicine of the Babylonians is not
different from the rest of their scientific literaturewhich knows only two forms: the list-from sign lists and Sumerian and
Akkadian bilingual word lists and grammatical paradigms to
mathematical and astronomical tables-and the procedural

text. In medicine, the list form is used in the pharmaceutical
compendia and the procedural in prescriptions. Even proce
dure texts do not constitute a proper handbook, however. Sci
entific texts in Babylonia deal with the particular,not the gen
eral; they describe procedures but not the justification, the
underlying reasons, for the procedures; they are casuistic and
not universalistic; they deal not with theory but with applica
tion. This holds, as has been many times stated, for Babylonian
collections of laws, which hence it is no longer customary to call
"law codes"; for Babylonian mathematics, which deal with
problems and not with proofs; for the few "procedure" texts
which describe step by step how to make glass, how to dye
wool purple, how to train horses and, we can now add from
a recently published manual, how to prepare meat dishes.181
In addition to the comparison of Babylonianand Greek medi
cine on the epistemological and structural level as Goltz has
done, the examination of the astral components of Babylonian
medicine, what in antiquity was called iatromathematics, is of
interest for identifying the direct threads that connect the two.
A guide for discovering the rationale-if one may call it that
behind the instructions to the physician found in these sources
is handily provided by Greek and Latin, Classical and late, and
even medieval texts. The non-Mesopotamian texts may serve as
guides, inasmuch as they can provide the general background
for the beliefs and practices we find in Mesopotamia; compar
isons, illuminating as they may be, should not be taken as
attempts to ascertain the priority of the Babylonian over the
Greek or the direction of influences, if any.182
Treatment and cure of diseases in Babylonia were the pur
view of two different kinds of practitioners: the asipu and the
asu.183The asipuwas the expert who performed apotropaic rit

uals, recited incantations, and executed magic manipulations;
hence the term is often translated as 'conjurer,''exorcist/ or the
like. It fell to him to examine the patient and to make a diag
nosis of the illness, to prognosticate its outcome, and also often
to determine its aitiology: whether the illness had a somatic
cause or whether it was brought about by a god or demon, or
by the infringement of a taboo. His role is evident from the
handbook known, from its incipit, as enumaana bit marsiasipu
illiku, "when the exorcistgoes to the house of the sick person,"
a handbook comprising forty chapters, to many of which an
cient commentaries have also been preserved.184
The treatment of the patient was the domain of the other
practitioner, the asu, whose title may be appropriately trans
lated as 'physician.' He was in charge of the preparation and
administration of the medicine and of other treatments among
which those we might call magical must also be counted. Sev
eral chapters of the corpus of the physician are extant, but they
seem not to have been organized into a single treatise such as
the exorcist's were. These chapters have such titles185as "if a
man's eyes are 'sick'"186 "if a man's head is feverish,"187and
commentaries to several of these chapters, as well as to others
that are not extant, are also known. Although elsewhere it is the exorcistwho performs exorcistic
and apotropaic rituals, the rituals and procedures designed to
make the medical treatment more effective belong in the

physician's domain. Foremost among them are those designed
to ascertain that the celestial powers make the medication
efficacious; to attain this goal the medicine has to be prepared
under the stars' benefic influence, and administered at a pro
pitious time.
The most commonly occurring phrase among the instruc
tions to this effect is "you let (the preparation) spend the night
under the stars."18S8ince the instruction refers to a medication prepared ahead of time, on the eve before it is administered to
the patient, it could be taken as the normal way of expressing
"to let stand overnight,"as in fact it has been translated in the
ChicagoAssyrian Dictionary.l89There are indeed practical rea
sons for letting the preparation stand overnight: the ingredi
ents must be steeped in the carrier-oil for salves, liquids for
potions and baths-in order to be properly blended.190The
mixture is sometimes put in the oven to steep or simmer over
night, and removed in the morning and cooled before use. Nev
ertheless, the practicalreason alone does not explain or justify
the procedure: exposition of the medication "tothe stars"is nec
essary to obtain astral irradiation.
The phrase is first encountered in medical texts written in
Akkadian atthe Hittite capitalHattusa (present-day Boghazkoy)
in Anatolia where they were excavatedin the early years of this
century; they can be dated to c. the thirteenth century B.c. As
these texts themselves are no doubt copies of, or modeled on
originals written in Babylonia, they take us back to the middle
of the second millennium and possibly even earlier,to the Old
Babylonian period from which few medical texts are extant.
The Boghazkoy material, in structure, content, and termi
nology, resembles the large corpus of medical texts from the
first millennium more than it does the few known Old Baby
lonian and Middle Babylonian exemplars; since much of the
intellectual as well as political history of Babylonia is hidden in

the so-called "dark ages," roughly from c. 1600 to c. 1400, the
break in the tradition, also evidenced by the Boghazkoy texts,
remains difficult to date and to explain. Nevertheless, one of
the Old Babylonian prescriptions already mentions that the
medication "should spend the night under the stars."191The
only difference between the Old Babylonian and the more
recent version is that the latter speaks to the physician, and the
early prescription speaks of the medicine.
A typical prescription found in a Boghazkoy text reads:
you mix (the ingredients)in first-qualitybeer,you let it spend the
night under the stars,in the morningyou strainthe first-quality
beer and you give it to him to drink.192
Another prescription:
you [steep] (the materia medica) together in water, you let it spend
the night under the stars, in the morning you [. . .] that water.193
Several other texts, many of them fragmentary,contain simi
larinstructions, for example: "you let that water (mixed with the
blood of a bat?)spend the night under the stars";19n4ote espe
cially "you let it spend the night [ . .], in the morning [. . .]."195
The same instructions, occasionally in an amplified version,
occur frequently in the large corpus of medical texts written in

Tiglath-Pileser I in Assur from the eleventh or tenth centuries

196A less literal translation of the phrase "you let it spend the night
under the stars."The phrase is comparable to Greek astronomefnt,hat is, to
expose to stellarirradiation,for which see Delatte, Herbarius(note 147above)

of the Arabic Picatrix as a single-word equivalent to "dem astralischen
Einfluss aussetzen."
197The injunction could refer not only to the patient's fasting, as it has
usually been taken and as it also seems to mean here, either because it was
recognized that ingesting medicine on an empty stomach makes it more
effective or because fasting is essential for cultic purity,but it could refer,as in
other cultures, to swallowing medicine and the like without chewing or, as
Pliny puts it, without the teeth touching it (quoniam dentibus tactisnihil pro
sint 'because if the teeth are touched [the medication] is useless' Pliny, NH
30.35). Probably for similar reasons is the use of a reed tube (Akkadian tak
kussu,cf. Pliny's perharundinemf)or administering medicine recommended.

"facing the sun,"208but more often mention only the exposure
to the stars,209occasionally adding "at night,"210or amplifying
the phrase as "to the stars of the night."211
To the stars are exposed other substances as well. To protect
from ghosts, a clay pot covering a figurine is exposed for three
days, to the sun during the day and to the stars at night: "you

tion follows).212
Nowhere is it stated in what way the stars are expected to act
on the medication or what specific effect their irradiation is to
achieve. Again, were it not for the knowledge we gain from the
Greeks, we might have been satisfied with the rationalist expla
nation mentioned earlier. Still, there exist clues that should have made us Assyriologists realize that more than a practical
result was desired by the nocturnal exposition. Forthe instruc
tions do not confine themselves to prescribe overnight exposi
tion to "stars"in general, but sometimes specify to which star
or constellation the preparation should be exposed. For ex
ample, a variant to one of the just cited prescriptions, instead
of exposition to "the stars of the night," specifies exposition to
the Goat star.213The instructions of another prescription are:
"at night you place it in front of the Goat star, and in the
morning, before sunrise, before he sets foot on the ground, he
drinks it."214Or also, for a salve for the eyes: "at night on the
roof [you expose it] to the Goat? star, in the morning, before
sunrise [you . . .] these herbs."215
The Goat star, which corresponds to the constellation Lyra,
is the celestial manifestation of the goddess Gula. Gula is the
goddess of healing; a chthonic goddess with a dog as her com
panion, and in other respects too resembling Hecate. This

aspect of the goddess also explains the fact that votive dogs
have been found in great numbers in the Gula temples,
including the recently excavated temple in Nippur. We should
also note that the goat is the animal of Hecate- and of her mani
festation as Selene-too.216 As most specific instructions mention the constellation of
Gula, the Goat, or rather She-goat,217it should be evident that
the aim of the procedure is irradiationby the starof the goddess
of healing. The star of Gula, especially the 0.1 magnitude Vega
in the constellation Lyra, the fourth brightest of all the stars, is
particularly prominent in the summer sky, but can be seen at
varying times any night of the year.218Other prescriptions state:
"These 24 herbs and aromaticsyou arrangebefore the Goat star,
you moisten them with beer, in the morning you boil it";219
"atnight you let it stand overnight before the Goat star, in [the
morning] you boil itf'220and so on.221
Any doubts about this identification should be dispelled by
the explicit instruction: "at night you let it stand overnight
before the Goat star, (you draw a magic circle around it with
flour, you cense it) and you invoke the names of Gula and of
Belet-ili."222The Goat star of one prescription is further
identified as the "cattle-pen"of Gula.223Instead of Goat star,
some texts simply say "before the goddess Gula."224

A further proof for the identity of the Goat star and the god
dess of healing is the recipe: "Youtake equal amounts of var
ious herbs, chop them, sprinkle them with pure juniper juice,
and place the mixture before Gula"while a duplicate to this text
says "place it before the Goat star."225Even the veterinarian
exposed the tonic he prepared for horses to the Goat star:"take
one-third liter each from the 23 plants enumerated above, .
leave them overnight exposed to the Goat star, in the morning
boil them, . . . this is a tonic for horses."226 The same sources from Anatolia that provided the earliest ref
erences to the practice of nocturnal exposition are also those
that give the reasons for it. They are, however, written in the
Hittite language, and thus were less accessible to Assyriolo
gists. One text, from about the thirteenth century, directs the
exorcist:"Takeit (the substance to be used) up to the roof, and
recite as follows: 'From on high in the sky may the thousand
stars incantit, and may the Moon god incantit.' And it remains
under the stars."227 The Hittite verb used for the celestial irradiation, hukkisk-, can be more easily translated into German, with the verb
'besprechen,' as the editor of the text, Kronasser,had done. For
lack of a similarly appropriate term in English, I have applied
the verb 'to incant,' reminiscent of "incantation,"to express
influence through irradiation. The Hittite text emphasizes the
power the stars exercise and the way in which this power is
manifested, while the Akkadian texts highlight the practi
tioner's act of the exposition.The result expected in both cul
tures, however, is not in doubt: the stars will make the potion
or salve potent and efficacious.
It was not always Vega, the Goat, that was invoked to irra
diate the medication, possibly because its position in the sky
was not favorable or the day not propitious for praying to the

goddess Gula. Corresponding in prominence to Vega in Lyra,
the brightest summer star, the brightest winter constellation is
Orion, known as the True Shepherd of Anu according to its
Sumerian name, Sipazianna.228While Orion too was wor
shipped as a deity in Mesopotamia,229few medical texts invoke
it. A fragmentary text230that preserves a ritual, including liba
tions, before the constellation probably belongs in the medical
corpus, judging by the few preserved ends of lines: "you salve
him,"231the name of the herb 'it-cures-twenty,232and the in
junction "without eating" (line 8).233An equally fragmentary
text invokes Orion against vertigo.234
More rarely, medical texts contain appeals to the Yoke star,
a constellation roughly equivalent to Bootes (see ChapterI), the
Scorpion, and Centaurus. But the constellation most frequently
beseeched to irradiate the substance exposed to it is Ursa
Maior, our Big Dipper, which occurs frequently in the Greek
magical papyri too under its more common Greek name, Bear
(apKTro'Sshe-bear'). The Babylonians called it Wagon,235after
the shape of the seven most conspicuous stars, a name that is
also used by various Eurasian peoples: in English (Charles')
228 The constellation's Akkadian name, Sitaddalu or Sidallu, is a word of
unknown meaning and etymology.
229 For Sipazianna's role in Babylonian ritual see Chapter VIII. He was
invoked in the Hellenistic magical papyri as Saint Orion (PGM I 29-36).

Bear and Wagon are attested in Homer: "the Great Bear that
mankind also calls the Wagon; she wheels on her axis always
fixed, watching Orion, and she alone is denied a plunge in the
Ocean's baths."236Only in Babylonia, however, do we have a
more detailed description of this constellation as well as the
enumeration of its parts: the yoke, the pole, and the side-pieces,
which in these prayers are equated with divine beings.237
Since Ursa Maior is a circumpolar constellation, and thus
never sets -"she alone is denied a plunge in the Ocean's baths"
or, as the Babylonians put it, "it stands there all year,"23i8t
could be invoked at any season of the year, so that practicalcon
siderations could have played a role in its choice. Weshould also
note that the Akkadian word for Wagon, eriqqu,is of feminine
gender. Therebythe Wagonconstellation may be identified with
the goddess Istar, and with her heavenly manifestation, the
planet Venus. The identification is attested not only in the
ancient star lists and commentaries according to which "The

Wagon is Venus in the East"239but is also evident from the
inclusion of omens from the Wagon among celestial omens
derived from phenomena of Venus observed.240In her mani
festation as the year-round visible, circumpolar constellation
Ursa Maior, the Big Dipper, Istar can exert her influence even
when her planet, Venus, is invisible.241
Other stars remain nameless. The chapter "if a man's head
is feverish" of the medical compendium includes recipes to
stop loss or thinning of hair, and the treatment is accompanied
by the recitation of charms. The last of a series of six such
charms (labeled "incantation") is addressed to an unnamed
star, identified only as the "first"star, and is accompanied by
offerings consisting not only of the usual foodstuffs (dates,
flour, a sweet confection, ghee, herbs and spices, etc.) but also
of a lamb. The address to the star is as follows:
You,star,who illuminates[.. .] the midstof heaven,who surveys
(all four)regions,
I, so-and-so,son of so-and-so,24p2rostratemyselfbeforeyou this
night, decide my case, give me a verdict,
let these herbs wipe awaythe evil that affectsme.243
Just as a magic circle around the herb itself before it was dug
up was indicated, a magic circle around the medicinal prepara
tion was supposed to enhance the effect expected from the noc
turnal exposition. Thus, a recipe directs: "you place (the three
herbs steeped in beer) before the Goat star (variant: the stars
of the night), you draw a circle around it,244in the morning
[...] you strain it, he drinks it without eating."245

MEDICINE
A medication prepared with herbs gathered in the proper
fashion, and exposed to irradiation by the stars often is also
administered at an astrologically propitious moment. Favor
able days for commencing some activity or enterprise are listed
in the hemerologies, but administering medicine is not singled
out, apart from the injunction "the physician must not treat a
patient"246which is mentioned among forbidden activities on
certain unpropitious days. The choice of particulartimes of the
month or year and the role of constellations and planets is sig
nificant not only in medicine but also in various domains of
magic; it will be given an appropriate place in Chapter V.
Starscan be efficacious in healing illness since they may have
been its cause. Poetic texts speak of illness "drizzling down
from the udders of heaven"247or "raining down from the
stars";charms for protection against some illness may state that
it "has come down from the stars in the sky";248dew coming
from stars may be evil as well as beneficial, as the phrases "evil
dew of the stars" and the "pure dew of the stars"249show.
More specific is the attribution to the planets Jupiterand Mars
of spleen and kidney ailments. We have here the first occur

does not make this connection clear. It cites the entry from a
medical text and then comments upon it. The first entry is "If
a man's spleen hurts him"; this is followed by the phrase that

itself: "in the spleen = Jupiter";a lexical equation, SA.GIG =

structured: "If a man's kidney hurts him, (the disease comes
from the god) Nergal, as they say: 'The Kidney-star is Mars.'"251
In this last scholionthe tertiumcomparationis,namely "Nergal is
Mars,"has been omitted. It is well known, from Ptolemy and
others, that Mars "governs"the kidneys; Jupiter "governs"the
liver and the stomach.252

CHAPTER IV
Divination253
They gaze at the stars (and) slaughterlambs (Neo-Assyrialnetter)
Mesopotamian man sought to learn what the future holds
from every conceivable event and manifestation of the world
around him. Gods gave signs through such happenings, and
these signs, the gods' warnings, could be read, and the future
that they predicted could be averted through penitence, prayer,
and appropriate apotropaic rituals, just as even the stern God
of the Old Testament could be swayed by the Ninivites' repen
tance, as the Book of Jonah teaches.
Some signs came unprovoked, through fortuitous happen
ings in house and fold and in the sky; others were specifically
requested as answers to questions put to the gods through a
variety of media.254
The fortuitous occurrence and a subsequent good fortune or
misfortune were linked in the mind of Mesopotamian man, as
they were in many early cultures and still are in primitive soci
eties, not so much as cause and effect, but as signals or fore
warnings and events. Such linked pairs, consisting of a protasis
(if-clause) and an apodosis (forecast), a pair called by the tech
nical term "omen,"were collected in lists, and these lists even

tually developed into the large compendia that we call omen
series. Usually, topically connected lists in the cuneiform
writing system are acrographicas well, that is, each item- each
line-begins with the same cuneiform sign or group of signs,
a feature that articulates the ancient syllabaries and vocabu
laries, as we saw earlier. Lists can therefore often be expanded
indefinitely through the addition of items that repeat the prot
asis with further specifications;255the forecasts connected
with these additional omens are accordingly modified. For
example, a phenomenon occurring on the right side of the liver
was paired with the same one occurring on the left, with the
opposite forecast. If one color occurred in the omen, similar
omens with other colors-five in all: white, black, red, green,
and variegated, always in this sequence-could be added. Num
bers were increased from one or two to three and more, even
if the increase resulted in an absurdity, as for example in the
enumeration of multiple births up to eight or nine.256"[T]he
original practical purpose of such collections of omens was
soon expanded, and even superseded, by theoretical aspira
tions. Instead of expressing general principles of interpretation
in abstract terms, the scribes strove to cover the range of pos
sibilities by means of systematic permutations in pairs (left
right, above-below, and so on) or in long rows."257The Baby
lonian omen series kept growing in this way.
Omens could be provoked by observing the shapes taken by
oil poured on water, a procedure called lecanomancy (from
Greek lekane'basin'), and by observing the configurations of
the smoke rising from an incense-burner, libanomancy (from
Greek libanos'frankincense'). These techniques were in vogue
in the Old Babylonian period, in the firsthalf of the second mil
lennium B.C., but die out with it.258 But the most ancient and the most tenacious in surviving of all the Babylonian divinatory

258 A few later excerpts of lecanomancy and libanomancy are extant but
their existence as a written tradition need not indicate that the techniques
were still in use, even though Nougayrol, Or. NS 32 (1963) 381 n. 1, argues
in favor of their survival.

DIVINATION
techniques is divination from the entrails (exta) of the lamb,
extispicy, a term more general, since it includes divination from
the gall bladder, the spleen, and the lungs, than the more com
monly known term, hepatoscopy, 'inspection of the liver' As
is well known, hepatoscopy was practiced in Italy by the Etrus
cans, so that the Romans called this divination the "Etruscan
discipline"; just as the hepatoscopy of the Etruscans ultimately
goes back to Mesopotamian origins259so another technique
practiced by the Etruscans, divination from thunder, bron
toscopy, also had its antecedents, no doubt, in Babylonia where
the meteorological omens formed part of the larger collection
of celestial omens.260Hepatoscopy remained the main means
of consulting the will of the gods, even as divination from celes
tial bodies was gaining in importance; as late as in the reign of
King Nabonidus the portents of celestial omens had to be
tested, as we shall see, by submitting queries about them to
the haruspex.
The diviner par excellence was the haruspex, whose name,
baru,literally means 'observer,seer.'The term was also applied
to those diviners who observed the configurations of the oil or
smoke, while the scholars who made astronomical observations and recorded the forecasts derived from celestial phenomena
were called tupsarEnumaAnu Enlil, a term meaning "scribe of
(the celestial omen series entitled) 'When Anu, Enlil. . .,"' and
best translated, albeit freely, "expert in celestial matters."An
abundant correspondence from the Neo-Assyrian empire at
tests the importance at the royal court of the diviners and
the astronomers who apprised the king of the portents, and the
exorcists who were expert in averting ill-boding forecasts by
their rituals.261The astronomers regularly conveyed to the
king such routine reports as the monthly sighting of the new

moon and the date of the opposition of sun and moon as well
as special reports on various predictable and predicted celestial
and meteorological phenomena, such as conjunctions, occulta
tions, and rain and thunder.262More than a thousand years
earlier, in Mari, the correspondents reported on such extraor
dinary events as torrential rains and thunder.263
Of the diviner we know from as early as the Old Babylonian
period that he accompanied the king on his campaigns;264
most diviners were attached to the court, though at least some
villages had a resident bfiru,as is shown by the complaint of an
Old Babylonian correspondent that there are not enough lambs
in the village even to provide the baru.265Nevertheless, some
diviners had to live by their wits. This is shown by the apotro
paic ritual aiming at "achieving renown for the diviner."266
Such renown, based on correct predictions, would attractthe
customers that the haruspex needed for his livelihood since he
belonged to the professionals-the diviner and the physician
who made their living from private clients, as did also the inn
keeper and baker with whom the diviner and the physician are
joined in another ritual to ensure brisk business.267

DIVINATION
The standing of the haruspex at the Neo-Assyrian court and
the respect accorded to his craft is evident from a "letter of rec
ommendation" addressed to the king.268 The writer of the letter recommends various scholars to the king as well-trained,
and justifies his opinion by characterizing even the expert in the
celestial omen series with the words baruti ile'i 'he is expert in barutu' although it is possible that the word barutuis here used as
a general term for 'divination' and not solely for 'hepatoscopy269
Before proceeding to the examination of the ominous parts
of the lamb sacrificed for this purpose, the diviner appealed to
his patron deities. These were, in the first millennium at least,
the sun god, Samas, and the storm god, Adad; the haruspex
invoked them at the beginning of his query as "O Samas, lord
of judgment, O Adad, lord of divination."270 In the earlier, Old
Babylonian, period prayers of the diviner for a successful extis
picy are similarly addressed to both deities271but also to Samas
alone. The appeal to Samas is easily understood since the Sun,
Samas, sees everything from above-the verb used is baru 'to
see.'272 More difficult to explain is the statement in these
prayers that he also "inscribes the omens in the entrails of the

lamb," an often quoted phrase whose exact significance still
eludes us, and which may have its origin in a mythological tale
that has been lost.273 The role of Adad, the storm god, as patron of the haruspex
is not as clear as that of the sun god, Samas, even though both
are invoked in the standard first-millennium prayer of the ha
ruspex. There is, however, another tradition according to which
it is not these two who stand by the haruspex to ensure correct
and reliable omens. Rather,it is to the stars and constellations who alone are present during his lonely vigil before he exam
ines the liver at dawn that the diviner addresses his prayer for
a successful extispicy. This is the Prayer to the Gods of the
Night we saw.
No other text is as explicit as this prayer about soliciting the
influence of the stars to secure a favorable outcome of the divination. Rarein Mesopotamia is also the lyricism of this poetic
text, with its setting of the still night. All are asleep, even the
great gods; alone are present the diviner preparing himself for
the act of sacrifice and divination, and the gods of the night,
the stars.
Two slightly divergent versions of this prayerhave been pre
served from the Old Babylonian period, that is, the eighteenth
or seventeenth century B.C.; in one of them ten constellations
are invoked by name: "Firegod (possibly Sirius), Erra(the god
of plague, possibly referring to Mars), Bow, Yoke, Orion,
Dragon, Wagon, Goat, Bison, Hydra";27i4n the other version,
omitting the Yoke and Hydra but adding the Pleiades, nine
only.275Most of them are zodiacal constellations; as in other
ancient catarchicmagic, few non-zodiacal constellations, such
as Ursa Maior and Minor, Sirius, Orion, the Pleiades, and Pega
sus, are mentioned.276
273The reference to C. J. Gadd, Ideasof Divine Rule in the Ancient East
(note 28 above) 57 n. 4, adduced by Nougayrol, CRAI1955p. 510 n. 5 in this

DIVINATION
The prayer,along with its description of the night, reappears
about one thousand years later, in the library of Assurbanipal
in Nineveh. In the late version the constellations addressed are much the same as those of the Old Babylonian period:
Enter,gods of the night, greatstars,
Yoke,Orion, Sulpae, [break],
Wagon,Ferry,Centaurus,Field,
Enter,gods of the night, goddesses of the night,
Starsof the south and the north, of the east and the west,
Enter,Ninsianna, GreatLady,and the innumerableneighboring
stars.
Perhaps even as late as the seventh century B.C. the prayer
served a practicalpurpose, and the diviner recited it before he
examined the entrails of the lamb.277Still, we should not discard the possibility that the text survived not only due to its
practical usefulness but in some measure also to its poetic
merit, as Oppenheim has suggested. To its lyricism our own
sensibility responds, even though in the later and more elab
orate prayer the nocturnal setting has become a topos and lost
the direct personal, emotional tone, a feature that seems to
have been censored by first-millennium taste.
The prayer exists also in a version midway in date between
the two, from c. 1200 B.C., found in the capital of the Hittite
empire (today Boghazkoy). It is embedded in a Hittite ritual,
but written in the Akkadian language albeit in an orthography
that shows it was written by a Hittite scribe. It has been known

since its publication by A. Jeremias in 1909.278 It ends with the
prayer to the gods of the night, and includes an enumeration
of seventeen stars and constellations.279 The prayer to the "gods of the night" is addressed to the noc
turnal stars and constellations, after the sun, the moon, and the evening star Venus have set: "The gods and goddesses of
the country-Samas, Sin, Adad and Istar-have gone home to
heaven to sleep, they will not give decisions or verdicts
(tonight) ."280 The setting of another Old Babylonian prayer of the harus
pex281is also night. It appeals to the planet Venus alone, as the
stellar deity Ninsianna, addressing it as a male deity, that is,
in the planet's male manifestation;282 the diviner invokes the
celestial power to ask that his examination find favorable signs:
O my lord Ninsianna,
accept this offering,
be present in my offering, and place in it a portent of well-being
and life for your servant Ur-Utu.283

It is also to the "gods of the night" that the haruspex turns
if the examination of the entrails discloses missing or otherwise
ill-portending parts:284
You great gods of the night,
whom Anu and Enlil have created, you efface the evil signs that have arisen [for me],
you remove from the man's house the ill-portending features that
occurred in [my] extispicy,
remove from me the evil sign that occurred in [my]house,
let that evil bypass me,
and I will sing your praises as long as I live.285

similar to the just quoted one, but shorter:"Icall to you, O great

simply 'entrails.'
284 These are described as siru (UZU.ME)hatuti, rev.(!) 28. Missing parts of
the exta are of ill portent and two paragraphs concerning them ("if in month

gods, stand by me in (this) night, undo the evil of the absence
of the ominous part that has occurred for me. I am afraid,
worried, exceedingly worried. Let that evil not come close to
me, not approach me, not attain me!"286
The outcome of the inspection of the exta is conveyed in a
letter to the person who requested the extispicy, or is recorded
in brief, indeed laconic form on small tablets. A number of such
reports, which often begin by stating the query posed to the
god, have survived from the Old Babylonian period.287
Around the middle of the second millennium, in Middle Baby
lonian reports on the inspection of the liver, the star Sirius is
also mentioned in the phrase "let him give instructions that
ditto (= they pray) to Sirius"; who the parties addressed are,
the haruspex or his client, is not stated in the text.288While sev
eral prayers to Sirius have been preserved, on which more will
be said later, none of them specifically asks the star to secure
good omens in the extispicy.
It is not only the haruspex who sought the stars' benefic
influence as he inspected the entrails of the lamb. At the more
popular level of divination, which I have dubbed "fortune
telling,"289and which uses means accessible to clients who
could not afford a lamb so that it could be called "divination
for everybody" ("la divination pour tous") by Jean Bottero,290
appeals are made to stars, especially to Ursa Maior, the Wagon
of the Babylonian sky. The popularity of the Big Dipper is also
attested in the Greek magical papyri which include several
prayersto this constellation under its Greek name 'Bear'(Greek tpKTOq).

DIVINATION
Two prayers to Ursa Maior are prescribed in the instructions
for "fortune-telling" to help obtain a reliable portent through
a dream. The first runs:
O Wagonstar,Wagonof the pure heavens!
Youryoke is Ninurta,your pole is Marduk,
Yourside-piecesare the two heavenlydaughtersof Anu.
Yourise in Assur,you turn towardBabylon.
Withoutyou the dying man does not die and the healthy man
cannotgo on his journey.
If I am to succeedon this journeyI am undertaking,let them give
me something(in my dream),
If I am not to succeedon this journeyI am undertaking,let them
accept something from me (in my dream).291
And the second:
O Wagonstar,heavenlyWagon!
Whose yoke is Ninurta,whose pole is Marduk,
Whose side-piecesare the two heavenlydaughtersof Anu.
She rises towardAssur,she turns towardBabylon.
Leta dreambringme a sign whetherso-and-so,son of so-and-so,
will becomehealthyand well!292
How the dream would indicate the recovery of the sick
person is left unsaid in the second of the prayersto Ursa Maior.
The first prayer, however, specifies what the dream content
should be to indicate success or failure of the enterprise con
cerning which the consultation is made. The significance of
giving or being given some object is detailed in the Assyrian
Dream-book,293and the stipulation of the prayer implies the
existence of this Dream-book, even though the expected predic
tion is not affected by the nature of the object given or received,
only by the fact that something is either given or received. This
simplification of an ominous occurrence is in accordance with

many later divinatory consultations, which restrict the answer
to 'yes' or 'no' In the late Assyrian period the haruspex evi
dently was only interested in learning whether the various fea
tures observed were favorable or unfavorable; adding them up
he gave a favorableprognosis if the favorablefeatures exceeded
the unfavorable ones, and vice versa.294 Another method listed in the same text for ascertaining the
favorable or unfavorable outcome of some enterprise,295which
is not specified, consists of pouring water over the head of a
recumbent ox and observing its reactions: whether it gets up
or not, lifts its tail or not, and the like. This particulartechnique
was not included in the cuneiform divinatory corpus, but a sim
ilar procedure is known from Greece: "AtDelphi the goats to
be sacrificed were tested by sprinkling a few drops of water into
their ear or on their coat to see whether the animal will remain
unmoved or react to this instigation."296Among the Baby
lonian divinatory texts was included a group, attested in several
exemplars, in which the movements and behavior of the lamb

Answers couched in similarterms, that is, success or failure

denoting the streaksof light or,less likely, the shape of the mete
orite found on the ground) in the omen series summaalu 'if a
city,'298while in the text concerned with "fortune-telling" and
in its partial parallel299it is the path of the shooting star-from
right to left-that will determine success.300

DIVINATION
Before pouring water on the ox, there is an appeal to the
"gods of the night," collectively called ilf dajanu 'divine judges':301
I invokeyou, divine judges, in the pure heavens;
I beseech you unceasinglywith prayerand prostration.
Shiningtorchin the midstof heaven, all the worldlongs foryour
light.
People observeyourverdicts,the weak submitsto your decrees.
Divine judges whose pronouncementcannotbe changed,
In this midnightwatchI pour pure springwateron the forehead
of an ox;
Let me see your true judgmentand your divine verdictso that I
may makea pronouncement.
Letthe ox providea verdictwhetherso-and-so,son of so-and-so,
will have success.
Even though the phrase ilii musiti'gods of the night' does not
appear in the title of the prayer, the ritual instructions that
follow it, which prescribe offerings to the "gods of the night,"
make it clear that the prayer addresses the stars.302
It is probably also in order to secure reliable oracularanswers
that the prayers designated in their subscripts as ikribu were
composed. Most of them are too fragmentaryto ascertain their
purpose with assurance. The word ikribu,a noun derived from
the verb karabu'to pray,' was assumed to designate a special
category of prayer accompanying a nocturnal consultation by
the diviner, since both the Old Babylonian prayer to the gods
of the night and those of the haruspex to the planet Venus under
its name Ninsianna cited earlier303have, in their subscripts,
the title ikribu.Other stellar deities are known to have rated ikribuprayers, as Nougayrol has reminded us.304A text that has

judges' is in lines 110 and 114.
302I had surmised, wrongly, in my discussion (JNES 19 28) that 'divine
judges' designate Samas and Adad, the patrons of the diviner; this sugges
tion was followed by WernerMayer, Untersuchungen(note 270 above) 423.

been known for a long time305contains most likely three ikribu
prayers:one to the Moon god Sin, another to Jupiter,and-the
last one-possibly to Venus. The prayer to Jupiter, still incom
plete, begins: "Jupiter,holy god, foremost of the gods, more
majestic?than the stars in the sky."306
While the diviner depends on the stars for eliciting reliable
predictions, practitionersof other divination techniques depend
on the haruspex to interpret and confirm the ominous signs
obtained through other media, primarily from celestial phe
nomena.307Even the prophecies of ecstatics had to be sub
mitted to the test of hepatoscopy, a test for which the hair of
the ecstatic'shead and the fringe of his cloak were dispatched
to represent the person on whose behalf the divination was
carried out. The long known and famous case of the diviner Asqudum
in Mari is now better situated with the publication of an entire
archive dealing with this haruspex who had to authenticate by
performing an extispicy not only the prophecies and dreams
of the ecstatics but even the prediction of a lunar eclipse.308
King Nabonidus' recourse, a thousand years later, to liver
omens in order to interpret a lunar eclipse is equally famous
and often studied.
Less explicit, and thus in greater need of explanatory com
ments, are the diviner's interpretations of two ominous celes
tial phenomena under Assyrian kings: of the lunar eclipse in
714 B.C. during Sargon's eighth campaign, and of the "secret
place" reached by Jupiterat Esarhaddon'sadvent to the throne.
Both episodes are recounted in the resgestaeof the kings, the

307The necessity for such a confirmation is attested among the Romans
too according to Pliny the younger: ". . . I will consult a haruspex whose
expertise I have often tested." Without delay, he makes a sacrifice, and
declares that the exta and the signs from the stars are in agreement. Epist.

so-called "royal inscriptions," styled as first-person accounts.
Sargon's account is styled as a letter to the god Assur.309
While Sargon was en route to Urartu the moon became
eclipsed and the darkness lasted from the first night watch into
the second; the haruspex, who as usual accompanied the king
on his campaign, was called upon to interpret the meaning of
the eclipse, a much-feared ill-portending event.310Sargon con
tinued his route only upon being assured that the portent pre
saged victory-in his case, unlike Croesus, the prediction for
tunately was not equivocal. Sargon's letter contains another
allusion to a favorable portent given the king by a certain, not
specified, phenomenon of Jupiter, here called "the star of
Marduk."311The interrelation between celestial portents and
liver omens is also attested, as we have seen (p. 12 above), in
reference to Sargon of Assyria's third-millennium predecessor,
Sargon of Akkad.
King Esarhaddon, Sargon's grandson, reports on how he
secured the throne for himself in the midst of the struggle for
power among the sons of Sennacherib after the king had been
murdered. His rightful succession was foretold in the stars:
among other favorable signs the "secret place" reached by the
planet Venus is mentioned.312When Jupiter shone exception
ally brightly and reached its "secretplace"-which seems to cor
respond to what in Greek astrology was called the planet's
"exaltation"(hypsoma),the sign of the zodiac in which it has the
greatest influence-in the beginning of his reign,313 this sign
was interpreted as a favorable portent for the rebuilding of Babylon.

oger, are coupled in the accusation cited in the Assyrian letter
of the crown prince Samas-sumu-ukin to Esarhaddon.314
"They gaze at the stars (and) slaughter lambs, (but) do not (or:
he does not) tell (anything) about the king, our lord, (and) the
crown prince of Babylon. Aplayu alone is a haruspex, Bel-eter
(and) Samas-zera-iqisa are astrologers; they look day and night
at the sky."315As Parpola notes, "The elaborate techniques of
astrology and extispicy were seriously utilized by the royal
palace in order to foresee the future course of events, and all
diviners-not only those resident at court-were obliged to
inform the king of their findings."316
It is, however, the episode concerning the lunar eclipse
under Nabonidus, the last of the Babylonian kings (555-539
B.C.), that best exemplifies the continuing predominance of
hepatoscopy. As the king recounts it,
When Nannarrequesteda high priestess
the Son of the Princeshowed his sign to the inhabitedworld;
the Bright-Lightmanifestedhis reliabledecision.

DIVINATION
Elsewhere317I commented on the imagery and poetic lan
guage of Nabonidus' inscription. What is of interest here is that
the sign given by the Moon god, a total eclipse in the month
of Ululu in the last watch of the night, a portent that is listed
in the compendium of celestial omens Enfma Anu Enlil with
the apodosis "Sin requests a high priestess," was not sufficient
for the king to act on it. The portent derived from a celestial
phenomenon had to be checked by the most ancient, most reli
able divinatory method, namely extispicy.
The celestial omen observed under Nabonidus was a total eclipse of the moon, an astronomical event not as rareas a solar
eclipse, and one that could be predicted with reasonable accu
racy shortly before the eclipse was to take place as early as the
seventh century B.C. Nabonidus does not specify how the ha
ruspex arrived at his verdict, what the features of the liver were
that gave him the answer to Nabonidus' query. The wording
of the king's questions indicates that the answer he expected
was in terms of yes or no, and indeed he reports that the gods
answered his queries with "yes" or "no." Nabonidus, whose
efforts to revive and relive the past are well known,318 no
doubt consciously imitated the Sumerian practiceof binary con
sultation in regard to the choosing of a high priestess,319even
though, as already mentioned, the practice was also prevalent
in the late Assyrian period.
While as late as the reign of Nabonidus the two divination
techniques went hand-in-hand or complemented one another,
there must have begun even then or shortly thereafter the pro
cess that culminated in the prevalence of astrology. The estab
lishment of correlations between the features of the liver and
stars or constellations, and their assignment to gods and to the
twelve months of the year, must have been one of the steps in
this development, a step for which we have some evidence
from a late Uruk text.

A rather obscure and poorly preserved small tablet from the
Seleucid period found at Warka32(0ancient Uruk) enumerates
the parts of the liver (with which the gall bladder is, as custom
ary, associated) or the marks on it, called "station"and the like,
and gives for each a correspondence with a god, a month, and
a constellation. To quote some of the better understood lines:
The "station"is Enlil;month I; [Aries].321
The "path"is Samas;month II;Taurus.
The "sweetmouth"is Nusku; month III;Orion.
The "strength"is Uras;month IV;Cancer,Plow-star.
The "gateof the palace"is Ninegal;month V; Regulus.
The "bubble"is the stormgod Adad;month VI;Ravenstar.
The gall bladderis Anu; monthVII;Libra.
The "finger"(identifiableas the processuspyramidalisi)s god
(broken);month VIII;Goatstar.
Similar are the entries for the remainder of the months on the much eroded and hard to read reverse of the tablet. The last two elements of each entry referto the month and the
zodiacal sign associated with it; these are standard, and some of
them recur in the list of MUL.APINTabletI.322 Month I (March
April)is associatedwith Aries;month II(April-May)with Taurus;
month IIIwith Orion in lieu of Gemini; month IV with Cancer; month V with Leo (that is, with Regulus); month VI with the
Raven (Corvus), which has its heliacal rising in month VI;
month VII (September-October) with Libra; month VIII with
the Goat (Lyra)which has its heliacal rising in that month;323
month X with Belet-balati;month XIwith Aquarius; and month
XIIapparently with Venus. (Month IX is omitted altogether.)324

DIVINATION
The novelty of this unique text is its establishing correspon
dences between the liver examined by the haruspex and the he
liacal risings of constellations. As another unique text to be dis
cussed in ChapterV states, correspondences between terrestrial
and celestial phenomena can and indeed must be established.
The parts of the liver and the marks on it are enumerated in
the sequence they are normally examined in the course of the
hepatoscopy. Their associations with the deities listed can be
explained in some cases only: in the case of the "bubble"asso
ciated with Adad, we can point to the Raven star called the star
of Adad;325other associations, such as that of the mark called
"path"with Samas, and of the gall bladder with Anu, have not
yet been found in our sources. The sequence of the parts enu
merated makes it certain that the starting point of the learned
treatise was the manual of the haruspex and that the zodiacal
signs were only secondarily associated with them.
The items of the text are accompanied by and thus were obvi
ously deemed worthy of scholia; unfortunately, most of the
explanations offered are rather opaque.326
Unique as this text is in Babylonian scholarly literature, it
testifies to an elaboration of the concept of the stellar influence
on the configurations that the liver could exhibit, and thereby
to the continued vitality of the Mesopotamian divinatory tra
dition, while its association between stars and planets and
parts of the exta, paralleled in the Apotelesmatikoaf Hephaistio
from Hellenistic Egypt,327 points to wide-ranging cross
currents in the Hellenistic Near East.

CHAPTER V
Apotropaia
Doch Abraxasbring ich selten!
GoetheWest-bstlicheDrivan
ipus Ea ipsurEa 'Ea has wrought it, Ea has loosed it,328this
phrase from a Babylonian incantation subsumes the essence of
Babylonian magic. Ea, the god of both wisdom and cunning
and hence the figure of the trickster god, is also the god of
magic. The verb from which the form ipus 'wrought' derives,
Akkadian epesu,a common verb with the basic meaning 'to do,'
is also the technical term for 'bewitching' and many nouns
derived from it denote various though for us often undifferen
tiated machinations, such as ipsu, upsasu, upisu, muppisutu,all
denoting sorcery,and muppisu,muppistu,muppisdnu,all denoting
practitioners of witchcraft.329The second verb form of the say
ing, ipsur'loosed' carriesthe apotropaicmessage par excellence,
both in its Akkadian version (verb: pasdru)and its Sumerian
counterpart, the Sumerian verb bur. It is from this Sumerian
verb that the ritual for undoing evil, Sumerian nam.bur.biand
its loan into Akkadian, namburbu, takes its name. The Sumerian noun is formed with the abstractnominalizing prefix
nam (in English, the suffix -ing) and the possessive suffix bi.
The literal translation, 'its loosing' refers by "it"to a previously

329 Similar is the usage in Croatian of the verb ciniti 'to do' and its corre
sponding noun cini (pl.) 'magic, compare the popular saying Ne cini cini na
mjesecini'Don't do magic in the moonlight' For Middle Latin factura'sorti

described ominous occurrence and the implicit or explicitly
stated impending evil that it portends. The suffix character of
bi is no longer transparent in Akkadian, and hence the loan
word namburbucan take Akkadian possessive suffixes, -Su'its'
and -sunu 'their.' By carrying out the prescribed actions and
reciting the appropriate prayers, the evil will be loosed330or
simply "he/it will be loosed."331
This apotropaion was made available to man by the same
gods who were willing to forewarnhim through some ominous
happening; the power of Ea to undo the portended evil
expressed in the cited incantation is repeated in a Neo-Assyrian
letter reporting on an earthquake and the evil portended by it:
'Ea has wrought it, Ea has loosed it, he who caused the earth
quake has himself carried out the apotropaic ritual.'332
One expects that each collection of omens had its parallel
apotropaic ritual. But while the omen collections were serial
ized, that is, arranged in books or chapters with more or less
canonical divisions and numbering, this does not seem to have
been the case with the namburbutexts.333Rather,certain apotro
paic rituals are inserted immediately after the ill-portending
omen, in midst of the omen collection itself; even the cata
logues of omen series that cite the title of some chapter may
add 'including its apotropaion' (adi namburbsu).334There are
also individual tablets inscribed with such rituals alone, one or
more; their subscripts do not indicate that they are part of a par
ticular series. Still, apparently every evil portent signaled by

APOTROPAIA
an ominous occurrence could be averted by the appropriate
ritual, as we gather from those texts that list in a catalogue
form335the events against whose evil consequences, generally
simply termed 'the evil' (Sumerian HUL, Akkadian lumnu),
such rituals could be invoked. If the origin of the evil was not
known, one could perform the rite against 'all evil' (Sumerian
HUL.DO.A.BI,Akkadian lumun kalama).336
The ritual itself is called apotropaion (namburbu)a, name that
appears at the beginning or as subscript at the end; occasion
ally it is introduced by the phrase annu namburbusu'this is its
loosing,'337or is followed by a rubric which states its purpose,
normally "apotropaion for the evil of such-and-such," for
example, "ofa snake,"or more specifically "ofa snake that spat
tered the man," that is, citing the ominous occurrence that
augured ill.338
Numerous are the apotropaic rituals that are concerned with
ominous everyday occurrences which are listed in the two
omen series summaalu ('if a city')339and summaizbu('if a crea
ture')340and which affect the common man in whose house
hold they are observed. They include strange happenings in
his house, his field, and his city in the first series, and
abnormal, monstruous births in pen and fold, even among
humans, in the second. On the other hand, forecastsfrom celes

tial phenomena collected in the treatise EnumaAnu Enlil or
from the inspection of the liver collected in the various chapters
of the series barutuaffect primarily the fate of the king and his
land, and thus have a national, even universal significance.
Only a few rare apotropaic rituals for averting such evils have
come down to us,341 even though the titles that are listed
without their text-in the mentioned catalogues assure us of
their existence. It is worthy of note that unknown, at least to
me, are apotropaia to avert evil portents derived from observ
ing the shapes taken by oil poured on water, and by observing
the configurations of the smoke rising from an incense-burner,
that is, lecanomancy and libanomancy, techniques used only
in the Old Babylonian period.342
Were it not that the absence of a certain type of apotropaic
ritual could be due to chance, the existence of apotropaia could
serve as a test to distinguish two types of divinatory text. The
ability to resort to apotropaic rituals would characterize those
omen collections in which the situation or event warns of an
impending occurrence, and the absence of apotropaia those
which do not foretell the future, but give as it were a diagnosis.
To the latter group belong, first of all, the diagnostic treatise
"When the exorcist goes to the house of the sick person" (see
Chapter III), and those compendia in which the apodosis
simply describes the person's character or habits. Among the
latter are the texts called "physiognomic omens"343and the
texts describing physical or behavioral characteristicsknown as
"A Guide to Moral Behavior Styled as Omens',344the omens

APOTROPAIA
of a greeting formula.346Evidently these attributes, for example,
being pusillanimous, or honest, or affectionate (described in
the Guide), or scratchingone's nose when speaking (mentioned
in the second compendium), even if they portended misfortune
were not thought to be susceptible of change through a ritual,
and neither were the diagnoses347of the causes or the out
come of the illness or its determinations about the sex and number of the children a pregnant woman was carrying.
Many a fortuitous happening, seemingly harmless, could
carrya warning about a grave impending event, which could be
warded off only by appealing to the gods, and what interests
us here in particular, astral gods. The evil was no less to be
feared if portended by a squeaky pot than by a more momen
tous occurrence, just as today a black cat crossing one's path
is said to bring bad luck.
There is in fact an apotropaion348designed to counteract the
evil portended by a squeaky pot. The portent is preserved in
summaalu in a sequence of omens dealing with squeaky pots
of various contents, among others, "If a pot of water squeaks
in a man's house."349The site of the ritual, which is the bank of the river or canal, is purified and offerings are made to the
gods Ea-god not only of magic but of sweet water as well
and Samas. Beforethe patient recites a prayerto Samas, a holy
water vessel, filled with water from the well of the temple of
Marduk into which herbs and beads of metal have been scattered, is to be placed "before the [. . .] star and the Wagon."350
After the prayer to Samas there is a break on the tablet, and

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
when the text resumes, on the reverse of the tablet, we find
addresses to a plurality, as the verb forms indicate; the ad
dressees could be the three gods of exorcism Ea, Samas, and
Asalluhi, but possibly are the two constellations to which the
holy water vessel was exposed, or even all the stars-the gods
of the night-as the phrasing of the prayer suggests: "I invoke
you from the heaven of Anu, I implore you (etc.)."351
The holy water vessel was exposed to the stars in several
other apotropaic rituals, one to ward off the evil portended by
a snake352and two against the evil portended by fire striking
a house.353No nocturnal prayer to the stars accompanies the
exposure; it is the Sun-god, Samas, who is addressed when
morning dawns.
When a fungus that portends evil appears on the walls of a
house a he-goat354is sacrificed before the Pleiades, while a
prayer to the Seven Gods, that is, the seven stars of the con
stellation, is recited355and a yellow she-goat (UZ SIG7)is sac
rificed to Gula, the goddess of healing, whose celestial mani
festation, the constellation Lyra, is called the Goat star.356
If a man falls on his face and starts bleeding, obviously an
ill-portending happening, he will avert the evil consequences
by making a food-offering to a certain deity (the name is
broken) and to the constellation Sagittarius.357

averted by an apotropaic ritual with prayers to the stars:
Incantation: Mighty stars who have resplendent positions in the
sky,
The g[reat?] gods have created you, wise Nu[dimmud (=Ea)
has ...] you.359
The names of the gods Enlil, Ea and possibly Sulpae follow;
the next fragmentary line-the last line before the break-with
its mention of "stars" possibly refers to the stars of the three
"paths" of Anu, Enlil, and Ea,360that is, all stars rising over the three "paths" on the horizon.361
Similar in tenor is the prayer362in the parallel text meant to
avert the evil portent of a "bird," probably a bat:363
8. [Incantation: You,] mighty stars, whom Anu and Enlil have [created], 9. [Enlil?,] Ea, Jupiter [. . .],
10. [You?] mighty stars who [have resplendent] positions in the sky.364

of its analog to the earthly event or object. One apotropaic
ritual, against the evil portended by a bow,365involves the Bow
star. The Bow-star (part of Canis Maior) in this case too repre
sents Istar,whose celestial manifestation it is, as we know from
several sources,366since the instructions call for two altars to
be set up, one to Ea and one to Istar, and for a sheep to be
sacrificed to Ea and a kid to the Bow-star.367
The analogy is less transparent, and possibly more tenuous,
in the ritual to be performed by the king to avertthe evil portent
of "cultcity and sanctuary."36I8t directs that a sacrificebe made
and a prayer recited to the Kidney-star: "Youarrange an altar
before the Kidney-star, . . . the king recites with lifted hands
before the Kidney-star as follows: Incantation. 'Enki . . .1"369
The prayer, in Sumerian, addresses the god Ea under his
Sumerian name Enki; the relationship of the Kidney-star
(which is part of the constellation Puppis) to the god Ea is not
known from other sources, but we may surmise it from a
learned commentary on the names of the phases of the moon.
The commentary370lists the names of the various phases of
the moon: the moon is called "crescent"from the first to the fifth day, and "resplendent crown" when full. From the sixth
to the tenth, the gibbous moon (amphikyrtos)is called kalttu
'kidney/ and is equated with Ea.371

is the series that already in antiquity bore the name iqquripus.

gestive title "A Babylonian Calendar of works, seasons, and
months," echoing Hesiod's WorksandDays.373This allusion not
withstanding, there is no work in Babylonian literature that
would parallel Hesiod's. As for those texts that indicate the
days and the months suitable for carrying out ritual or magic
manipulations, they will be our concern later insofar as these
moments are affected by astral positions.
The Babylonian almanac or calendar exists in two arrange
ments, one according to the enterprise envisaged, and the
other according to the month. In the first, each activity forms
one paragraph, and the prognosis for each month is stated in
the style normal for omens. For example, the first paragraph
from which the name of the series was taken- states "Ifhe tears down (iqqur)his house in Nisannu (i.e., month I), he . . .; if
in Ayaru (month II), . . " and so on. Hence, each paragraph
consists of normally twelve entries, one for each month of the
year, and occasionally of thirteen, if it also includes the inter
calary month of the Babylonian calendar, that is, the month
that was periodically added so that the year, made up of twelve
lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days, could be brought
into agreement with the solar year of 365 and a fraction days.
The other arrangement374excerpts these paragraphs according
to months, so that under each month all pertinent activities are
listed along with the prognosis for him who would perform
them. Not all of these "monthly sets" are extant, though some
of the months exist in duplicate copies to show that different
traditions singled out different activities worthy of inclusion.
In fact, only the first sixty-odd paragraphs record activities
whose outcome may be favorable or not. The last forty para
graphs deal not with intentional undertakings, but with the
forces of nature, and the transition between the two sections
is formed by paragraph 66' that deals with fire-presumably
lightning-striking a house. From paragraph 67 on the topics
are the ones treated in the compendium of celestial omens, the
series Enima Anu Enlil, 'When Anu (and) Enlil,375but include

only a selection, and the predictions differ according to the
month in which a particularphenomenon takes place. The list
of ominous celestial events varies with the different sources,
ranging from the always present predictions from eclipses of
the moon and of the sun, haloes of the moon, first appearance
of Venus, and a few meteorological phenomena, among them
thunder, rain, and earthquakes, to risings of other planets376
not attested in every source. In spite of the crude reckoning that
can have no claim to astronomical precision-days (in addition
to months) are stated only in regard to the visibilities of Venus
while the other phenomena are described solely in terms of
months, and those schematic thirty-day months-concern with
celestial phenomena is manifest in these texts too. The last of
the paragraphs concerned with celestial and meteorological
events (?104 in Labat's edition) is followed by a paragraph
(numbered ?105 in Labat'sedition) that lists the twelve months
and assigns each to a god or goddess. In one exemplar, VAT
9772, which lists only twelve months and omits the thirteenth,
the series does not end there but continues with additional material. Unfortunately, the ends of the lines, which are all that
survive, show only that further predictions were listed, but not
what the phenomena were from which these were derived.
Concatenating several series is not unique to this text. Else
where, different lexical texts are combined into a single compo
sition, possibly reflecting the sequence of the scribe's curric

dSul-pa-e,an incipit which is attested on several fragments and
lists.379 Just as there are apotropaic rituals to avert the evil conse
quences of such everyday occurrences as are enumerated in the
series summaalu and in the series iqqurTpuSo, thers, against the
evil portended by celestial happenings, also exist but in a
smaller number, the more regrettable as there are Arabic and
Indian magical texts with which it would be interesting to com
pare them. Of a quite different character are the prolonged
and public expiatory rites performed when a lunar eclipse
occurred.380 The existence of rituals to avert quite specific ill-portending
celestial phenomena can, however, be inferred from the "uni
versal catalogues"381that we may call "HUL-lists"from the
words that begin each line: inaHUL,Akkadian inalumun, 'from
the evil of.' The sequence of celestial phenomena whose evil
consequence is to be averted is the same in the HUL-lists as
the sequence of topics in the compendium of celestial omens
EnumaAnu Enlil: Moon, Sun, weather-phenomena (including
earthquakes), and stars and planets, also known as the four
books Sin, Samas, Adad, and Istar,and the sequence of those
paragraphs of the series iqqurtpuS that parallel the celestial
omen compendium. One catalogue382enumerates, possibly
with reference to the king, eclipses of, first (in a broken section)
the moon, then of the sun and of Venus, as well as flaring up
of stars, earthquakes, and various cloud-configurations: "when
[... an eclipse of either the Moon] or of the Sun or of Venus,
or a flaring? [star (or .. .)] or an earthquake [or ... or a] cloud?
or a fireball?or an asqulalu-phenomenon is seen."383A list of

Assyria. One of the letters mentions the evil (portended) by
Mars that missed its appointed time and entered Aries.390
Another speaks of the late rising of Jupiter391and a third392of
its dark aspect at rising. This last example provides an addi
tional proof, if such were still necessary, that the scholars who
reported to Esarhaddon were consulting the omen series, since
the partly broken omen that the writer cites can be restored
from a number of celestial omen tablets, some of which are cited in the commentary to the letter393while others394are as
yet unpublished.
The conjunction of Mars and the Moon was also an occasion
for an apotropaic ritual, but only the incipit is extant in the
subscript of a namburbi: "if Mars and the Moon go side by
side."395In yet another apotropaic ritual the "evil"is attributed
to Sagittarius (dPA.BIL.SAG).396A curious ritual seeking to
"remove a star by the door from a house"397is written on a
tablet that is designated by its subscript as the "123rd tablet"
of a composition whose name is broken.398The ritual seeks to
ward off the evil portent by throwing into the river "[an effigy?

of] the star that fell into your house" and reciting a spell in
Sumerian399and a prayer to Samas in Akkadian. How a
shooting starcould land in a man's house is difficultto imagine,
but portents from shooting stars are not only known from stan
dard omen collections400but are requested as answers to the
petitioner's question in the popular media of divination more
akin to "fortune-telling,"as I have had the occasion to show.401
The compendium iqqurtpuScombined the activities and phe
nomena of everyday life listed in ??1-66 with the portents
announced by celestial bodies in ??67ff. The compilers of iqqur
lpuS simply juxtaposed omens reflecting the two domains of
heaven and earth and, correspondingly, public and privatefore
casts. Rare is a true conflation of the two, of which we saw a
late example (p. 78) establishing a relationship between parts
of the liver examined by the haruspex and zodiacal and other
constellations. An effort to establish a relation between omens portended by various media was begun, however, even earlier.
Speculations to this effect are set out in a text already known
under Assurbanipal, from whose library its exemplars come.
It was edited by Leo Oppenheim under the programmatictitle
"A Babylonian Diviner's Manual."402The text is a rarity not
only in regard to its subject matter but especially in its attempt
to give a rationale for the correspondences between signs
observed in the sky and signs on earth, in contrast to the
Mesopotamian approach which, as we have seen, does not nor
mally give reasons or explanations.
The interconnections between celestial and terrestrialomens are stressed several times but they are eventually expressed in
the simple terms: the portents on earth and those in the sky
correspond. The task of the diviner, as we can infer from the

statements of the author, is both to interpret the signs as they
are observed individually, and to establish a relation between
the terrestrialand the celestial omens. It is noteworthy that this
"manual,"as much as it proclaims the correspondence (in the
Baudelairian sense) of terrestrialand celestial omens, is written
on tablets some of which are also inscribed with planetary
omens. ".. our difficult text is witness to the renewed vigor
the Mesopotamian scholar brought to bear on enlarging and
refining previous divination techniques in the outgoing second
and incoming first millennium, a vigor which created a
plethora of new forms and methods of divination while at the
same time it carefully maintained the heritage of the early
second millennium achievements."403 The text's first explicit statement:404"The signs in the sky
just as those on earth give us signals,"405follows the listing of
incipits of "fourteen tablets with signs occurring on earth"and
the second, even more insistent, "The signs on earth just as
those in the sky give us signals; sky and earth both produce
portents, though appearing separately they are not separate
because sky and earth are related,"is the subscript to a list of
incipits of "eleven tablets with signs occurring in the sky."406
The correspondence between the two domains extends to the
consequences of the portents, as the Manual continues with a
warning about evil-portending signs: "Asign that portends evil
in the sky is evil on earth, one that portends evil on earth is
evil in the sky,"407and about the necessity of calculating
whether it is susceptible of apotropaic rituals or not.408The
next rubric gives the grand total of the two groups of tablets:
"Insumma twenty-five tablets with signs (occurring) in the sky
and on earth whose good and evil portents are in harmony(?).
You will find in them every sign that has occurred in the sky
(and) has been observed on earth. This is the method to dispel
(them): . 409

Even though farfrom "everysign"can be found in the twenty
five tablets whose incipits follow,410we should note the sig
nificant statement that there exists "a method to dispel them."
This method, for which precisely the term for apotropaion,
namburbui,s used,411is not a simple catalogue of apotropaic rit
uals similar to the ones quoted on pp. 83f., but rather instruc
tions for establishing, by astronomical calculations, the exact
date of the event and for finding in a hemerological table
appended to the Manual the month and day when such rituals
can be effective.412 The already mentioned Uruk text with its correspondences
of parts of the liver with times (possibly indicating zodiacal
signs) and celestial bodies, the correspondences drawn between
the signs of the zodiac and the performance of apotropaic rites
(see Chapter VI) and the Diviner's Manual all indicate various
tentatives to refine the techniques or, to use PeterBrown'sterm,
"the technology of sorcery in the ancient world,"41i3nto more
sophisticated methods that culminate in Hellenistic astrology,
and thus testify, as I have had occasion to stress earlier, to the
continued vitality of the Mesopotamian divinatory tradition.

Sorcerers and Sorceresses

Seneca, Medea750
Sorcerer and sorceress414could coerce the power inherent in
the celestial bodies for evil purposes, as we learn from the very
rituals that are designed to counteract the machinations of
these magicians. Rituals for curing an ailment or other affliction
suspected of having been brought about by such machinations
are prescribed when "witchcraft was practised against that
man before the such-and-such star."41T5he words 'witchcraft'
(ipsu) and 'was practiced against him' (epsusu)belong, as we
saw, to the family of the verb epesu,'to do,'that is also the tech
nical term for 'bewitching.' Another term for witchcraft or sor
cery, kispu, belongs to the family of words that includes the
terms for sorcerer (kassapu)and sorceress (kasSaptu),derived
from the verb kasapu'to bewitch.'
In Babylonian sources, the witches carry out their magic
"before"a star,and they are not known to bring the stars down
from the sky as Medea raved416nor do magic texts reveal that
414 For 'sorceress' many descriptive terms, mostly designating these
women as coming from foreign parts, are known, see Tzvi Abusch, "The

they bring down the moon. To this feat there is only a cryptic
allusion in a Neo-Assyrian letter. Nevertheless, it is this allu
sion that establishes yet another link between the Mesopo
tamian and Classical cultures, and at the same time makes us aware of the constraints imposed on our understanding by the
paucity and the accident of preservation of the data.
The allusion is found in a Neo-Assyrian letter written to King
Esarhaddon in the seventh century B.C.which contains the fol
lowing passage:
As for the messengerswhom the king, my lord, sent to Guzana,
who wouldlistentothe disparagingremarksofTarasiandhis wife?
His wife, Zaza, and Tara5ihimself are not to be spared. ...
Theirwomen would bringthe moon down fromheaven!417
We might easily have dismissed the last sentence as a simple
hyperbole would it not remind us of the often-celebrated feat
of "the Thessalian witches who draw down the moon from heaven"418mentioned by Plato, the feat of drawing down the
moon that had become in Latin literature the hallmark of sor
ceresses, expressed by the Latinphrase detraherelunam,or dedu
cerelunam.419 The power to draw down the moon was attributedespecially
to the sorceresses of Thessaly, a land of magic compellingly
described by Lucan in The Civil War:
". .. I want the Snake that lies up there to come down here like a gigantic
torrent. I want the two Bears-the big one, useful to Greek ships, and the
small one, useful to Phoenician ships-to feel the Snake's enormous coils

SORCERERS AND SORCERESSES
The pregnant fields a horrid crop produce,
Noxious, and fit for witchcraft's deadly use;
With baleful weeds each mountain's brow is hung,
And listening rocks attend the charmer's song.
There potent and mysterious plants arise,
Plants that compel the gods, and awe the skies;
There leaves unfolded to Medea's view,
Such as her native Colchis never knew.420
In this land the witches exercise their magic power to draw
down the moon:
Magic the starry lamps from heaven can tear,
And shoot them gleaming through the dusky air;
Can blot fair Cynthia's countenance serene,
And poison with foul spells the silver queen.
.. . . .. . . o... .. .. ...
Held by the charming song, she strives in vain,
And labours with the long pursuing pain;
Till down, and downward still, compell'd to come,
On hallow'd herbs she sheds her fatal foam.421
A more prosaic translation of the last section, this one by
Robert Graves:422 "Witches have introduced the art of drag
ging the stars from the sky; and know how to turn the Moon
dim and muddy-coloured, as though she were being eclipsed
by the Earth's shadow-after which they pull her close to them
and torture her until she secretes poisonous foam on the plants
growing underneath."
420 The verse translation is that of Nicholas Rowe from the early 18th
century.

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
The sorceresses' ability to draw down the moon, which is
attested even in modern circum-mediterranean popular lore,423
has been given a rationalist explanation not only in modern
times; the means to achieve this feat (with candles, water, and
mirrors)had been denounced already in the fourth century by
bishop Hippolytus of Rome.424
The connection between the Classical topos and the refer
ence contained in the Neo-Assyrian letter has been overlooked
for many years.425If in Greek and Latin poetry "bringing
down the moon from heaven" was already a topos,426associ
ated with the sorceresses of Thessaly,427or with barbarians, for example by Lucian in his Loverof Lieswith a Hyperborean,
the origin and original referent of this strange image are
unknown. We may assume that it was already well known by
the seventh century B.C., when it appears in the quoted Neo
Assyrian letter, since, in speaking of the barbariansof Guzana
in Syria, the simple allusion to "their women who bring the
moon down from heaven" sufficed to brand them as witches. Even further, while Greek and Latin poets often allude to this
feat of the sorceresses-the most famous being perhaps the
verse "Charms(that is, incantations) are able to draw the Moon

win, eds. (Gottingae: Dieterich, 1859).
425 In fact, Leroy Watermanin 1930 not only translated the letter as cited,
but in his Commentary refers to a certain Sina Schiffer, and if we follow up
this reference to the journal Oriens. TheOrientalReview(January1926, p. 34,
n. 38) Schifferhad founded in Paristo promote collaborationbetween French
and American scholars, but which did not live beyond its first year, we find
that he speaks of the Classical origin of "this allegorical locution." Unfortu
nately, Waterman'sCommentary is hardly consulted nowadays, and so his
insight into the connection between the letter and the Classical parallels has
borne no fruit.

from the sky"428of Virgil's Eighth Eclogue-there is no refer
ence, to my knowledge, to this feat either in the poetry of the
Babylonians, or in their astral magic. It is true that the male
Moon god of the Sumerians and the Semites has less affinity
with the 'wise women' of Mesopotamia than the goddess Selene,
Cynthia, or Luna of the Greeks and Romans. Perhaps it is for
this reason that it was the power of the stars that Babylonian
sorceresses and other magicians were using to carry out their
machinations. The means of affecting the intended victim involve, as in
other cultures, the use of figurines made of him429or, more
directly,imbuing with sorceries, in Akkadian kispu,the food he
eats, the water he drinks, and the oil he uses as body ointment.
An elaborate ritual extending throughout a whole night, called
Maqlu'Burning' is designed to counteract these evil machina
tions by burning figurines of the person suspected of having
wrought sorcery.430The ritual begins, appropriately, with a
prayer to the "gods of the night": "I invoke you, Gods of the
night, with you I invoke the night, the veiled bride, I invoke
(the three watches of the night) the evening watch, the mid
night watch, the dawn watch."431It is from such rituals, and
from the proscription of black magic found in the law books
(the Code of Hammurapi and the Middle Assyrian Laws) that
the machinations of sorcerers and sorceresses can be documented, since instructions for practicing such noxious magic
have, for good reason, not come down to us.432
The effect of "witchcraftpracticed before the such-and-such
star" is manifested in a number of afflictions, physical as well

as psychological, that are described in the opening words of the
treatment. The names of these afflictions are usually written
with Sumerograms, that is, a group of cuneiform signs whose
literalmeaning can usually be derived from their Sumerian con
stituent elements, but for which the Akkadian equivalent is not
always known, and whose exact meaning is by no means se
curely established.
Nevertheless, the very names of certain diseases or disabili
ties indicate their astral cause: 'semen of Jupiter'433"'hand"
(SU) of Sin (i.e., the Moon)' or "'hand" of Samas (i.e., the Sun),
and "'seizure"by Lugalirra'434one of the twin gods who, with
Meslamtaea, represents the Twin stars, Gemini. The nature of
the relationship of the disease to the deity said to have caused
it with his "hand"or his "seizure"is usually impossible to deter
mine. As to the "semen" or "sperm"of the stars435describing
certain illnesses, it may be a name for "dew" (which is else
where called "Blood of the stars"),436since dew is said to
descend from the stars, and dew can be maleficent-"the evil dew of the stars"-as well as soothing.437
Most frequently mentioned among the magic afflictionsdiag
nosed as inflicted with the connivance of the stars is the one called 'cutting the breath.'438Since according to the rubric of
one such ritual "'cutting the breath'has been practiced against
433rihut Sulpaea. Names composed with "semen" or "sperm" and the
name of a god appear among "secret"names given to herbs in PGMXII401,
etc. (see p. 33 above), see Hopfner, Offenbarungszaubevro,l. 1 ?493, and the
herbal of Pseudo-Dioscorides mentions the plant 'Sperm of Hermes,' see
ibid. ?494. Whether the "sperm of the stars"refers to a particularingredient
or is to be understood as "dew" is unclear. Note the designation "Blood of
the stars" given to dew by dream-interpreters, among other such fancy
names deplored by Artemidorus, Onirocriticon4,22 (note 132 above), cited
Hopfner, vol. 1 ?496.

436 See the Artemidorus reference cited in a preceding note.
437See note 249. 438Another translation is "throat-cutting."The ambiguity stems from the
various meanings of the Sumerian element zi of the loanword zikurudu(from
Sumerian zi.ku(d).ru.da)and of its Akkadian equivalent napistu, that can
mean life, breath, and throat as well. Forliteratureand suggested identifica

the man in front of Sirius,"43t9he cure is sought from Sirius
too. It takes the form of a complex ritual with alternating liba
tions and prayers to (literally:before) Sirius. The rites are per
formed in a curtained-off enclosure prescribed in other rituals
too440and the prayer441is recited three times with the appropri
ate "liftingof the hand."The instructions say: "facingSirius you
sweep the roof, you sprinkle pure water,you strew juniper on a
censer (aglow) with acacia-embers, you libate fine beer, you
prostrate yourself, you draw the curtains, you set out heaps of
flour, you purify that man with censer, torch, and holy-water
basin, you have him stand inside the curtains on garden herbs?,
he lifts his hand, recites this 'recitation'three times, each time
he recites it he prostrates himself and tells everything that is
on his mind, and then the wrath of (his) god and goddess will
be loosed, the sorcery and machinations will be loosed."442

"seizure" by Lugalirra,44'5semen of Jupiter'446and "hand" of
Sin or "hand" of Samas,447or 'epilepsy?'448 and diseases called
with such opaque names as 'hatred';449other afflictions may
have been described in the broken sections. That these were wrought by magic means can be inferred from enumerations
of the same afflictions in other sources among effects of witch
craft;450in this very text one of them is attributed to the
placing of a figurine of the man in a grave with a dead man451
and another to the fact that wax figurines of him were "laid
down"452-no doubt also in a grave or some other gruesome
place. That some, perhaps all, of the strange-named and
sorcery-induced diseases refer to psychological disorders has
also been suggested.453

SORCERERS AND SORCERESSES
'seizing of the mouth,454and which therefore has been taken
to describe aphasia,455that is, an inability to speak, can be
shown to have been imputed to evil magic by referring once
again to Classical sources. In the Waspsof Aristophanes a dog
is put on trial, accused of stealing a piece of cheese. When he
takes the stand, the dog, famed for his barking, is suddenly
and strangely silent. The president of the mock tribunal, con
cerned lest this silence be interpreted as an admission of guilt,
is ready with a precedent for such an incident: he quotes the
case of a certain Thucydides, son of Melesias, who suffered
the same mishap when he was on trial-he suddenly became
paralyzed in his jaw.456According to the scholia, this Thucyd
ides, an excellent orator,after he had heard his accusers make their case in the course of a trial, was not able to plead his own
defense, just as if he had a tongue which had been bound from
within. In this way he was convicted and afterwardsostracized.
Other stories also recount inexplicable seizures suffered by
". . .even experienced orators while pleading at the bar";
further testimonies457come from inscriptions and from the life
of Libanius, the famous oratorof the fourth century A.D., who
was accused of having cast a spell on a rival whose memory
failed in the midst of a speech. Libanius himself tells us in his

autobiography (1.245-49) how at one point late in his life he
became gravely ill and was no longer able to read, write, or
speak before his students, until there was mysteriously dis
covered in his lecture hall the body of a chameleon, strangely
twisted and mutilated; one of its forefeet was missing, and the
other was "closing the mouth for silence." Libanius recognized
a case of magic, and what concerns us especially here, he inter
preted the placing of the chameleon's forefoot upon its mouth
as having effected the silencing of his speech. He regained his
health, he says, only after the body of the chameleon was
removed from the room.458 The "seizing of the mouth" in Babylonian magic texts also
was designed, no doubt, to bring about the inability to speak,
especially to speak in one's defense before the judges.
The witchcraftresponsible for such afflictionswas performed,
as the medicaltextexpressly states, "before"certainstars:accord
ing to one diagnosis, 'a "binding" was "bound" for him before
Jupiter on the 21st (or) the 22nd';459according to another,
'magic [was practiced] against that man on the 4th? of month
XI "before"Centaurus,'460or 'magic was practiced against that
man on the nth of month XII "before"Scorpius';461and, with
the name of the starbroken: '[magic was practiced] against that
man "before" [. . .].'462 In another diagnosis only the month
name is preserved, not the star's:'[magic was practiced] against
that man [on the nth?] of month IV ["before" . . .].'463This last

purposes, as an unfortunately fragmentary prescription, from
which little survives beyond the phrase "[witchcraftwas prac

What a star has wrought, a star will undo. To counteract the
evil magic, one turns again to the stars: materials to be used in
the ritual, just as medications (see pp. 48ff.), are to be exposed
to stars, as in the instruction: "you expose it to all? stars";465
two now broken lines must have held similar instructions.466 An effluvium from a celestial body may manifest itself not
only as "seizure" or "hand";467 another image used is "cov
ering" or "clapping down," an image taken from the impact of
a net.468For example, a diagnosis states: "the name (of the ill
ness) is 'male fly of . .,' a wind has swept over him, it is 'cov
ering by Sagittarius' you may make a prognostication,"469and
another: "its name is 'female fly of . ..' a wind has swept over
him, it is 'covering by the Twins' you may make a prognosti
cation."470The term also occurs in the fragmentary prescrip
tions "for 'covering by Istar.'471Unidentified is the disease or
symptom called "staff of the Moon."472
The stars are appealed to as individual divine beings whose
influence is sought in order to avert the sorcerers' machina
tions, and it is in the same guise that they are invoked to save
from other afflictions, or to achieve a desired goal. Their

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
influence is not yet connected, as it will be in Hellenistic astrol
ogy, with their positions, their "houses/' and aspects.
Still, there exist a few texts from Babylonia that seem to
be precursors of Greek astrology. Two late, largely parallel,
lists from Hellenistic Uruk473enumerate the "regions" or
"areas"47o4f the zodiacal constellations associated with a certain activity which, in order to succeed, has to be carried out
in that region. Occasionally an explicit instruction is added: tep
pusmaisallim "if you carry it out, it will succeed."
It is again the Greek astrological tradition that provides the
clue for interpreting the Babylonian references to the signs of
the zodiac. What the texts mean when they refer to these signs
is the region of the sky where the Moon stands in that partic
ular moment. The Moon's position is considered auspicious or
inauspicious for engaging in a specific activity, and these
moments have been collected in so-called Lunaria (when
written in Latin), preserved from the second century A.D.
onward,475to which the Babylonian texts represent often very
close parallels.
The lunarianot only indicate the auspicious moments (with
such phrases as bonumest, utile est) but also the times to be
avoided (with such phrases as malumest or caveatvos) when
engaging in a specific activity. The Babylonian "Lunarium"
includes, e.g., "to bring back a fugitive: region of Regulus, or
Libra,"47c6omparable to finding a fugitive, indicated for several

texts have been studied by Jean Bottero, EPHE, Annuaire 1974/75 130ff.,
reprinted in JeanBottero, Mytheset ritesde Babylone(Geneva-Paris:Slatkine
Champion, 1985) 100ff.
474The term used is the Sumerogram KIwith the reading qaqqar 'uground,
area, region,' written syllabically in LBAT1626 rev 6'. It is possible that a
better translation would be 'place' (locus).
475The earliest preserved text is the elspiKaTapcVx6of Maximus, edited

fies the days suitable for making amulets and phylacteria and
carrying out magical operations.490
Some of the entries must go back to an earlier period, as is
shown by the philological commentary appended to one of the
two texts to explicate it and to render the Sumerograms in
Akkadian; the other text has been provided with an arithmet
ical scheme, known in Greek astrology under the name dode
katemoriai,n which two points of the zodiac are related in such
a fashion that the dodekatemorioonf one position is found by
adding to a particular degree of the sign (i.e., a number
between 1 and 30) its twelve-fold multiple; the resulting
number then is expressed by a degree in another sign.491
While only two texts are complete, several fragments dealing
with "regions"testify that such speculations were fashionable
in the late period. Most of the fragments are as yet unpub
lished; one of them that is published shows the term "region"
in one of its rubrics.492The names of two zodiacal constella
tions, Virgo and Capricorn, can be read in this small fragment;
it is possible to restorethe namresof others, along with the activ
ities recommended when the Moon is in their "region,"from
the two Uruk texts. For example, the Moon in the region of
Virgo assures "that he who sees you rejoices at seeing you";493
the Moon in the region of the (. . .) star494 is "for being
purified through the river (ordeal)";495another "so that a

By determining the propitious time for initiating an activity,
the genre represents an early example of the process known as
catarchic astrology.499
The correspondences drawn between the signs of the zodiac
and the performance of the apotropaic or prophylactic rites
have a forerunner from a much earlier time. The tablet that records them comes from the site of Sultantepe and is dated
to 619 B.C.500 and thus the composition of the text must
precede this date. The same catarchic magic that was listed in
the late texts is here stated in terms of propitious dates rather
than signs of the zodiac.501
The most significant difference between the two is the
absence in the earlier text of the astronomical data of BRM 4 19.502The Sultantepe text goes through the months of the
year, singling out the days of the months that are propitious for
carrying out the described enterprise.503Its recommendations
are expressed by the already mentioned formula teppusma
isallim"ifyou carryit out, it will succeed" which ends each sec
tion. It also includes activities that are now missing or were
never included in the late texts, such as, for the first month in its entirety ("from the 1st to the 30th") "desire,"504also "for

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
Some entries are applicable to more than one month.506
According to rev. 18, days 27,28, and 29 of every month are (pro
pitious) for [expelling?]the demon SAG.HUL.HA.ZA,literally:
'who holds the head of evil'507 The medieval lunariathat list every day of the month are not
much different from the hemerologies that list auspicious and
inauspicious days, adding, in the words of Boll and Gundel,
only a thin veneer of astrology508over the ancient menologies,
and the previously adduced lunariaor zodiologia,which list the
twelve zodiacal signs, can similarly be considered offshoots of
the ancient menologies.
Such hemerologies and menologies existed in Mesopo
tamia,509both in the redaction in which the days and the
months are listed in their calendrical order and marked as either good or bad for initiating certain activities, and in the
reverse format, in which the activity is mentioned first, and is
followed by the list of the months or days which are recom
mended for its execution or are to be avoided.510The resemblances to the last section (lines 765-828) of Hesiod's Worksand
Days, even though they are few and superficial, have naturally
been noted by the editors of these texts.511
As for the cultic significance of the days and months of the

being prepared by A. Livingstone.

year from Sumerian times onward, and for the local calendars
of the second millennium, it is only recently that efforts have
been underway512to enlarge and update Benno Landsberger's
early work of 1915,513since he himself never returned to the
subject in a second volume as he had promised.
The cuneiform hemerologies list the days that are favorable
in their entirety or in part-in general or for conducting a par
ticular kind of business or activity, either private, such as
building a house, taking a wife, or religious, such as addressing
prayers and offerings to a god or goddess. The sequence is
calendricalby months and days; some texts are laid out in a grid
pattern, indicating "favorable"(SE)or "unfavorable"(NU SE)in
the appropriate column of a table.514
Some lists give only a selection of the days of the month. The
selection always includes the days that are most dangerous,
namely the "evil" days 7, 14, 19, 21, 28. Cultically significant
days on which prayers and offerings to gods are prescribed are
found especially in hemerologies prepared for use by the king,
and perhaps exclusively in those. Astral gods to whom prayers
and offerings are to be made are conceived in their astral mani
festations: stars, constellations, and planets; offerings to the
Moon are prescribed for the 15th day, the day of the full moon
in the standardized thirty-day month. A hemerological text
from Assur which is the most explicit of all515prescribes
offerings on the 18th of Nisannu (the first month in the cal
endar) to the Pleiades (ii 45); on the 19th and on X 10 to Orion
(Sipazianna, ii 15 and r. ii 48); on III 16 to Marduk, Gula, and
Venus (v 44f.); on III 12 and XI 14 to Venus (v 32 and r. ii 53);
on IV 18 to the Scorpion (MUL.GIR.TAB,vi 47); and VI 16 and
VII 14 to Jupiter (Sulpae, r. v 50 and r. iv 80).

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
Conversely, on particular days food and sex proscriptions
apply, to avoid acts abhorrent to the astral deity. One of the
more common proscriptions, that of eating fish and leeks, is on
day 7 of month VII516said to be prohibited by "Sulpae, lord of
the date grove"; as often, the reference is frustrating because
a connection between Sulpae, that is, Jupiter, and date groves
is not otherwise attested, nor are we told what these two forbidden foodstuffs have to do with Jupiter, even though offer
ing onions is considered sacrilegious in the Greek magical
papyri.517
On the 7th of month VIIthere is a prohibition for having inter
course with one's wife because "she will despoil him of his
virility; it is an abhorrence to the Wagon of the sky of Anu.'518
Again, the relationship between sexual abstinence and the
Wagon is not explicit, but the connection between the (celestial)
Wagon, Ursa Maior, which often represents Venus, and sexual
taboo is readily understandable.
The few late texts concerning the relationship of days of the
month and the signs of the zodiac519presumably reflect Helle
nistic speculations. These are the texts for which the term "cal

number can be found, it has been suggested, among other spec
ulations, that it refers to the number of days in a gestation
period. In the first text (no. 104) the sequence begins with I 7
(Aries 7?) for day one, continuing with X 14 (Capricorn14?)for
day two, etc.522
Typical of "Calendar texts" is the association of zodiacal
signs with a tree, a stone, an herb, and various other items.
Sources come from Seleucid Uruk523 and their relationship
with Hellenistic texts is shown by the fact that they assign the
same entities to the signs of the zodiac-or rather, of a micro
521 Egbert von Weiher, SpTU,vol. 3 nos. 104 (month IV) and 105 (month
VIII).
522Not all the designations of the zodiacal signs are the standard ones
used in astronomical texts. Both texts (nos. 104 and 105) use the month
names BAR(month I) instead of LUor HUNfor Aries (I), and SU (month IV)
instead of ALLAfor Cancer (IV). Moreover,the sign GUD'Taurus'is replaced
by MUL.MU 'LPleiades' (II),MAS.MAS'Gemini'by SIPA'Orion'(III),and 1IKU
'Field'(= Square of Pegasus) (XII?)stands for ZIB(Pisces, XII);both texts also
use the abbreviated names GiR (= GIR.TABf)or Scorpius, SIPA(= SIPA.ZI.
AN.NA) for Orion (standing for Gemini), PA(= PA.BIL.SAGf)or Sagittarius,
SUHUR(= SUHUR.MASf)or Capricorn. However, according to the catch line
of no. 104, the next tablet of the set, dealing with month V, again designates
Taurus, as usual, by GUD 'Bull.'

most likely also comes from late Babylonian Uruk. Landsbergerdrew atten

zodiac524in which each sign is divided into twelve units of 2/2
degrees each-as do the Cyranides,525as I discuss in Chapter
VII. The above-described Uruk texts assign to each of the cal
endar dates an ointment whose ingredients are related to the
zodiacal sign by a pun, either linguistic or purely orthographic,
on the name of the sign. Thus, the text prescribes as ointment
the following ingredients:
Forthe first month, corresponding to the zodiacal sign Aries
'Ram' the ingredients areblood, tallow, and wool from a sheep;
for month II, corresponding to the zodiacal sign Taurus 'Bull/
here designated by one of its conspicuous constellations, the
Pleiades, they are blood, fat, or hair of a bull; for month III,
corresponding to the zodiacal sign Gemini, here, as in the simi
larly late text cited on p. 80, designated by the name of the
constellation Orion, they are to contain the head, blood, and
feather of a rooster;526for month IV, corresponding to the
zodiacal sign Cancer 'Crab,'the blood and fat of a crab; for
month V, corresponding to the zodiacal sign Leo 'Lion' blood,
tallow, or hair from a lion; for month VI, corresponding to the
zodiacal sign Virgo 'Furrow'52f7lour made of sigusu-barley,the
head and feather of a raven; for month VII, corresponding to
the zodiacal sign libra 'Scales' . .;528 for month VIII, corre
sponding to the zodiacal sign Scorpius 'Scorpion' . . .; for
month IX, corresponding to the zodiacal sign Sagittarius, here
designated by the name of the god Pabilsag, the head, feather,
and blood of the anzu-bird;for month X, corresponding to the
zodiacal sign Capricorn, blood, fat, and hair of a goat; for
month XI, corresponding to the zodiacal sign Aquarius,529the

526 Written DAR.MUSEN, which elsewhere corresponds to Akkadian
ittidu 'francolin' but which here must be an abbreviation for DAR.LUGAL. MUSEN = tarlugallu 'Rooster,' part of the constellation Canis Minor.
527 The name of the constellation is written, as usual in late texts, with the signs KI.DIDLIthat have no known etymology, unless they stand for Akka
dian asar nisirti, literally "secret place," a term designating the sign in which
a planet reaches its exaltation (Greek: hypsoma). The constellation Raven
(Corvus) has its heliacal rising in month VI; compare the text cited p. 78.
528 The entry is, here and in the next month, the unintelligible KI.KAL-tim.
529 The name of the constellation, written GU, abbreviated from its Sumerogram GU.LA, does not seem to be connected with the word for 'eagle.'
116



SORCERERS AND SORCERESSES
head, feather, and blood of an eagle; for month XII, corre
sponding to the zodiacal sign Pisces, here designated by 'Field,
the name for the Square of Pegasus, the head and blood (vari
ant: heart) of a dove, the head and blood of a swallow.
The late origin of the text is also evident from the fact that
the punning relationship between the prescription and the
corresponding sign of the zodiac can be understood only with
reference to the classical zodiac. For example, the recipe pre
scribed for the first month is prepared from a sheep although
the expected zodiacal sign, Aries 'ram' is not mentioned nor
is the Akkadian name of the sign, Agru 'hired man' associated
with "sheep";MUL.LU,MOL.LU,or simply LUwith the mean
ing "Aries"is well attested in Seleucid texts.530Note also that
the prescription for the second month requires the blood, fat,
or hair of a bull, but the month is identified by the constellation
MUL.MUL'Stars,'i.e., the Pleiades, used in late texts instead of the name GUD 'Bull' of the zodiacal sign.
I am not able to solve the problem posed by the unintelligible
KI.KAL-timprescribed for months VII and VIII, the signs Libra
and Scorpius. However, although less transparent, the connec
tion between the birds that provide materials for the ointments
and the month or sign for which these are prescribed, can be
astronomically justified;531thus month III, Gemini, desig
nated by Orion, is connected with the Rooster, a part of Canis
Minor; month VI appropriately with the Raven (Corvus);
month XI, Aquarius, with the Eagle (Aquila), and month XII,
Pisces, with the Swallow, a name for the western Fish of Pisces. Since the identification of the anzu-birdis not certain, its connection with month IX, Sagittarius, cannot be argued.
Heads and feathers of various birds indeed appear as ingre
dients in various Mesopotamian recipes, both magic and medi
cal, just as they do in medieval magic texts. Among twelve
recipes against a disease532-its name is broken on the tablet
530See A. Sachs, JCS 6 (1952) 71f. ad TCL 6 14:6-20. Among various the
ories for the origin of the writing LU,the association of LU(a cuneiform sign
that may also be read UDU 'sheep') with the zodiacal sign Aries 'ram'was
also discussed by Ungnad, AfO 14 (1941-44) 256 n. 37.

only in the last five are the names of the ingredients preserved,

the tenth the head of a goose,534the eleventh the head of an

Pliny,NH 37.169.
Human-headed bulls and other stone colossi guarded, as it
is well known, the gates of Assyrian palaces. Their apotropaic
function is sometimes inherent in their names already, as that
of the guardian figure called aladlammu(from the two Sumerian
words aladand lamma,both designating protective spirits); the
name of another, apsasatu,reflects its shape (from the word for
cow, Sumerian db).Both these learned loanwords were coined,
along with many others, during the renaissance of learning
under the Sargonid kings.
The palace of Alcinous too was guarded, as we know from
the Odyssey, by apotropaic dogs of gold and silver, fashioned
for the Phaeacian king by Hephaestus the Magician.544But
only the Assyrian king Esarhaddon explains how the guard
ians fulfilled their function: they were made of the stone SE.TIR
"repelling the evil one according to their siknu."545The avail
able, usual translation of this word siknu as 'form' (in the

alternative translation "which by virtue of their form ward off
evil" of the above phrase) seemed to indicate to Faraone,in his
comparison of Greek and Near Eastern apotropaic statues, that
the Assyrian king attributed the operative force of the statues
to their form alone. We have seen, however, that in reference to the handbooks describing herbs or stones a more appro
priate translation of the word siknuwould be 'nature. A trans
lation 'nature' also vindicates Faraone's suggestion that "the
medium could also be an important factor."His suggestion was
based on an inscription of Sennacherib who boasts of having
had protective colossal statues546fashioned from that same
stone SE.TIR,54w7hich, as the old translation had it, "was nor
mally used only for making neck amulets."548Unfortunately,
Sennacherib does not say exactly this. Rather,as the more up
to-date translation has it, he identifies "the pindu stone which
at the time of my forefathers was (considered) too precious to
be (worn) around the neck."549Still, as Faraonehad surmised,
it is the material, the substance, the nature of the stone-its
siknu-that gives it its power, a power described in the hand
book called, afterits incipit, abnusikinsu'the nature of the stone
is.' Of the entries of this handbook, which has survived only
in fragmentary state,550some preserve the description of the
stone or mineral, and others also the purpose for which it is
suited. For example:

the such-and-suchstone is to preventmigraine;
the such-and-suchstone which has a greenishtinge is to assure
that the god be favorable to the man; and so on.552
Descriptions that appear only in the Assyrian kings' narra
tives probably are citations from this work, as that of the girim
hilibu stone, which protects one from plague553or of the elallu
stone, which serves to obtain obedience,554while that of the SE.TIR-stone"which ensures obedience and averts destruction"555may be compared with "the stone for averting de
struction," attested in a list of amulet stones.556The 'nature' of the SE.TIR-stoneitself does not happen to be preserved in the
Stone-book, and many of the Stone-book's descriptions leave
the modern reader perplexed and, as so often, with his curi
osity unsatisfied. Take the entry: "the stone whose nature is
like fish eye is called 'fish-eye'"; no more informative though
more picturesque is the description of, for example, the stone
arzalluas "the stone whose nature is like a stork'swing" or the
stone abasmucalled "stone of sunset";557another stone or pos
sibly the same-the name is not preserved-is called "stone

that is, either on the first column of the obverse or the last column of the reverse. The bottom of the tablet is not preserved, so that the purpose of the
enumeration is not apparent. Neither are the beginnings of the lines pre
served, so that the name of the stone with which the line began is missing;
to compound the uncertainty caused by the break at the left margin, it is also
often impossible to tell whether a line is a new entry, or whether it continues
the preceding line. The text belongs possibly to the abnusikinsuseries. Sim

A place of special interest was allotted to the magnetite,
Sumerian KA.GI.NA.DIB.BAa, compound translated into Ak
kadian as sadanu (KA.GI.NA)with an epithet written DIB.BA
that may be read sabtuor sabitu.Since the reading of the Sumer
ogram DIB.BAis ambiguous, the epithet either describes the
magnetic attractionof the stone: sabitu'capturing' or alludes to
the magnetite captured, along with a cohort of rebellious
stones, by the god Ninurta in the Sumerian mythological epic
tale Lugale:56s0abtu'captive.'Akkadian sadanumost likely simply
refers to the ore's '(coming) from the mountain'561but the
explanation of the corresponding Sumerogram KA.GI.NAas
'speaking the truth' is probably just popular etymology, based
on the possible translation dababu'to speak' of its component
KA, and the translation kinu 'true' or kittu 'truth'of its compo
nent GI.NA; the stone therefore is given the aitiology "the
stone of truthfulness, he who wears it shall speak the truth,
only a pious man may wear it."562This function of "the stone
of truthfulness" evokes of course Pliny's statement that posses
sion of the haematite reveals treacherous designs on the part
of the barbarians.563 Reference to the "Babylonian Stone-book" is made in a Neo
Babylonian list of stones564which culls stone names, both
Sumerian and Akkadian, from the standard lexical list HAR-ra

Besides the handbooks, there exist shorter lists of herbs

written on narrow tablets,571whose shape itself is reminiscent
of the lamellae made of lead or other metals. Certain Akkadian stone names have been adduced to explain Arabic and Greek counterparts.572 The fame of stones'
magical properties and the aitiological explanations pertaining
to them have spread beyond Babylonia. The best known of
these is the aititesor 'eagle-stone.' Its name in Akkadian is aban
ere (or its phonetic variant abanare), of which the second ele
ment, eru or aru, is both the word for eagle and the infinitive
of the verb 'to be pregnant' It is in the bilingual Sumerian and
Akkadian lists that we find the "basic"meaning, or at least the

meaning that was considered primary: the Sumerian name of
the stone is na4.pes4'stone for pregnancy' Nevertheless, in
Akkadian context, the name of the stone is often written, in rebus writing, with the Sumerogram NA4.A.MUSEN,that
is, NA4 = aban'stone (of)' A.MUSEN'eagle-bird' = eru. It is of
course the homonymity of 'pregnant' and 'eagle' and the use
of the logogram of the latter word for the former, that gave rise
to the fable about the stone to be found in the nest of the eagle,
brought by the eagle from India or other far-away places,573
or, according to other sources, found in the head of a fish called
'eagle'574to serve as amulet for pregnant women.575
The claim that stones have such beneficial properties was rid
iculed by Pliny the Elder when he wrote in his NaturalHistory
in the first century A.D.: "Zachaliasof Babylon, in the volumes
which he dedicates to King Mithridates, attributes man's des
tiny to the influence of precious stones; and as for the 'haema
titis' [a stone discussed by Pliny earlier], he is not content to
credit it with curing diseases of the eyes and liver, but places
it even in the hands of petitioners to the king,576allows it to
interfere in lawsuits and trials, and proclaims also that to be
smeared with an ointment containing it is beneficial in battle."577
Beads made of semi-precious stones, shells, and other
colored stones (some of which are probably colored glasses578)
are supposed to protect from evils wrought by demons or
witches. Even though in some of the Assyriological literature
they are called "amulet stones," this designation may be mis
leading, as our own associations with the word "amulet" are

THE NATURE OF STONES
different and, moreover,modern authors use the term "amulet" to referto a variety of things.579In fact, the Latin word amuletum
from which "amulet"is borrowed has no known etymology,580
and when Greek and Latintexts speak of using such stones and
other materials for protection, they simply prescribe "tying
them on" as in Latin (ad)alligare,Greek kathapteinor periaptein.
It is exactlythe same phrase, 'to tie on,' that is used in Akkadian
to describe wearing such phylacteries.581
Amulets are used mostly not singly, but on a string. Such a
string of beads (Akkadian turru)is made up of various stones
strung on a cord of colored-red, white, black, or multicolored
wool to be worn as charms around the neck, on the right or left
wrist, or the right or left ankle. Other charms-amulet stones
may be placed on the chest or the abdomen. A particularlywell
known example from Hellenistic and medieval magic texts and
lapidaries is the charm used to make a woman talk, a phrase
that recurs verbatim in a Babylonian magic text.582It is only
the Hellenistic lapidary that says that by placing the prepara
tion on the sleeping woman's bosom (Greek: psyche, a term
used for pudenda),she will be induced to talk. It is, however,
a medieval text that tells us that if you place the stone from the
nest of an owl [la huppe< upupa]on the bosom of the sleeping
woman, she will babble out in her sleep if she has a lover.583
Prescriptions for various ills include long lists of such beads,
579E.g., Beatrice L. Goff, "The Role of Amulets in Mesopotamian Ritual

sometimes enumerated in sets for each such string; the lists
end by stating the purpose of the string (turru), or simply of
the group of "stones" (Akkadian abnu, usually expressed with
the Sumerogram NA4) and the manner of application. For
example, a small tablet enumerates eleven beads, and summa
rizes them as "eleven stones for blurred vision,584to string on
red wool, you wrap 'wolf-bane' on seven rolls (lippT)of blue
wool, while you recite a charm, and tie it on his left hand."585
Tocure a hemorrhaging woman you string on red wool various
stones, recite the appropriate magic spell, and tie the string
around her waist;586another string for the same purpose is to
be strung on the tendon of a dead cow or dead sheep, with
fourteen-that is, twice seven-knots tied between the beads.587
Not all the items are precious or semi-precious stones, or
even stones at all. Among the "stones" enumerated there
appear beads made of a metal, either of the precious metals
silver and gold, or of others, such as copper, iron, or tin, and
beads of various minerals such as antimon, and even shells, all of which are normally written by means of their Sumerograms,
with initial NA4'stone. Specifications added to names of stones are rare, except for
the qualification "male"or "female"mentioned earlier in con
nection with the sex of herbs (ChapterII).Male and female vari
eties of stones are known from Classical texts588and from late
antiquity; for example, it is said of the topaz that "it is green,
. . . hard, compact, transparent. This is the male variety. The
female variety is lighter."589Male and female stones are named
not only in magic texts590and in the stone lists,591but they are
so classified in the "Glass texts,"the Assyrian prescriptions for

refers to a variety of aspu stone as sa uskarukullumu 'which
shows a (moon?) crescent'593 and some shells are often
specified as having seven spots.594
In contradistinction to the amulet of antiquity, which
according to one definition is "astone of inherent supernatural
powers that may be engraved and/or consecrated, and that is
either used as a seal or worn as a phylactery" and to the tal
isman, which is "an image either made of metal in the round
or engraved on a metal plate, over which image a ceremony of
incantations and suffumigations is performed in order to
induce a spirit to enter the talisman and to endow it with
power,"595the Babylonian "stone" bears no engraving or
image. The images and engravings on Babylonian cylinder
seals have a different origin and aitiology, even though of
course some seals may have been worn as amulets,596and
even though the particular stone that serves as material for a
cylinder seal is said to determine the fate of the person who
wears such a seal in the omens appended to one exemplarof the
abnusikinsuseries.597Nor does the Babylonian string of stones

normally undergo a ceremony of consecration by which a spirit
is induced to enter it and to endow it with power. The power
sought to imbue the string or the individual stones is that
coming from the stars. For this reason they must be exposed
to irradiation by stars.
In a recently published ritual enumerating the proper amulet
stones to be used in various predicaments598such an exposi
tion to the Goat star is recommended against the evil machi
nations of an "ill-wisher"or, as the term bellemuttimay also be
translated, "adversary."Other strings listed in the same text,
but without specifically prescribed nocturnal exposition, pro
tect from such physical ailments as diseases of the eye,599but
also from harm brought about by enemies, ill-wishers, divine
anger,600and sorcery.601The ritual to protect the client from
the disastrous consequences (described in lines 8-16) brought
about by an "ill-wisher" begins with column ii line 8.602 It is
divided in two parts; the first section of seven lines (ii 17-23)
enumerates seven phylacteries, one in each line, containing
two herbs and one stone each, while the next section goes
without a ruling-from the enumeration of stones to the expo
sition to the Goat star (the star of Gula) and the prayerto Gula,
beginning in ii 24 and ending in iii 2, for a total of thirty lines.603
This last section begins with a list of twelve stones-as a matter
of fact, when you count them there are thirteen-and many of
them cannot be identified:
Carnelian, lapis lazuli, yellow obsidian, mekku,egizangu,pappardilu,
papparminul,amassu?,antimon, jasper, magnetite, turminu,abasmu,

How stones acquired their renown for protecting from evil
and granting success to an enterprise is not known; however, there is a tradition about strings of amulet stones harking back to a famous king of the past. Some are attributed to Hammu
rapi, Naram-Sin, and Rim-Sin, just as some "proven salves" bear the name of Hammurapi.606 A list enumerating fourteen amulet stones, to which several duplicates exist, has as subscript: "14 stones of the necklace of Naram-Sin,"607 while variants to it attribute the necklace to King Rim-Sin.
604The first four signs, u-sa'-an-ni,are unintelligible to me. They seem to
stand for a first or third person past tense of the verb sunnu 'to repeat' or
'to change,' or possibly may have to be read sam-sa-an-nior sam-gar-an-ni,
with the ending -anni that could represent a first person dative.
605Compare the address to the Wagon star in STT73 (see p. 71).

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
The date of composition of the Stone-book is not known, but
it probably is to be placed around the turn, or at the beginning
of the firstmillennium, when much of the speculative literature
and scholiaoriginated, as opposed to lists of stones and other
objects of the material world, which go back to the very origin
of cuneiform writing. It is worth noting that of these latter lists
only chapters XIV (snakes and other animals), XVI (stones),
and XVII (plants) of the lexical series HAR-ra = hubulluhave
parallels in the three handbooks characterizedby their kenning
sikinsu.It is therefore significant that the same three kingdoms
of nature have a role not only in Hellenistic magic but also, with
slight modifications, in Babylonian astral magic.
The relevant part of Hellenistic magic is described in the
work called Cyranides.60B8ook I "contains twenty-four alpha
betically ordered chapters. In each of these are enumerated,
both individually and in combination, the magical-medical
properties of four entities which share a common letter, these
entities being plant, bird, stone, and fish. Eachchapter also con
tains the description of an amulet made of the relevant stone
and containing in its design one or more of the other enti
ties."609Neither birds nor fish-which, by the way, share one
tablet, Tablet XVIII, of HAR-ra = hubullu-appear in the Baby
lonian sources; they are replaced by trees, so that in lieu of four
entities, Babylonian sources enumerate three only as being per
tinent in magic: plants, stones, and trees. The references to this
practice are rare and often unclear, but the juxtaposition of
these three is diagnostic. For example: "when? you practice?
plant, stone, and tree and exorcism, do it along with its com
mentary?"61o0r "when you want to ascertain the zodiacal sign
of Edith Porada, Ann E. Farkaset al., eds. (Mainz on Rhine: Philipp von

THE NATURE OF STONES
in ... stone, plant, and tree [... .]1611 Trees, plants, and stones
were associated with zodiacal signs in late Babylonian texts
as they were in Hellenistic Egypt, and to these entities were
sometimes added animals, cities, and excerpts or incipits of
mantic material, lists of gods and temples, and others.612No
explicit reference is made, however, to amulets with such pic
torial representations.
In a late commentary613the mention of plant, stone, and
tree is possibly connected with medicine, if my reading614"to
heal him [. . .] plant, stone, and tree of/which [. . .]" is correct;
the next line of the text already makes the association of a zodi
acal sign with magic operations615for which the main sources
arethe two Neo-Babylonian texts BRM4 20 and 19,and the simi
lar texts LBAT1597 and LBAT1626, discussed in Chapter VI.
The just cited text which associates the three entities plant,
stone, and tree with exorcism or magic (Akkadian masmasutuor
asipitu 'art of the exorcist') enjoins the practitioner to have
recourse to its situ or, as the signs can also be read, setu. The
latter reading, setu, designates a commentary arranged like a
glossary in two columns, and such a commentary would have
given in the second column the synonym or explanation of the
word in the first.616What the commentary to U NA4u GISmay
have contained we do not know; possibly it gave equivalences,
1986)73, and translatedby him as "When you perform plant stone and wood
and the art of the exorcist for a sick man-one performs (it) with its com

CHAPTER VIII
Nocturnal Rituals
Stellis atque herbis vis est, sed maximaverbis
Heim, IncantamentaMagica, p. 465
Night is a time when spirits roam and danger lurks. . .. The
ominous day was one of the dark, moonless nights of the inter
lunium at the end of the month between last and first visibility
of the moon, nights when it was indeed believed that evil
spirits could roam freely."618But night is also filled with the
emanations of the moon and the stars, and is thereby suited
for the performance of rituals and magic manipulations. The
moon may have been an ally of sorceresses-it was the full
moon that Erichtho, Medea, and other notorious sorceresses "drew down" to make their magic more efficacious, thus
making Thessaly, the home of witches, famous from Plato to
Lucan619-but no Mesopotamian text speaks of the influence
of its waxing and waning on the growth of crops or on various
human activities. No instructions are extant about procedures
known from folklore and that the farmers' handbooks of
antiquity-Virgil, Columella, Pliny the Elder-recommend and
that are still practiced today under the name "biody
namics":620say, planting to be carried out when the Moon is
waxing, and pruning when it is waning.621

data, a letter from the Old Babylonian period that warns not to soak? the
sesame seeds in preparationfor sowing before the rising of Sirius. The letter,

F. R. Kraus, JAOS88 (1968) 116 and again, adding a reference to stars sig

Moon and Sun may combine their influences. Accordingly,
two dates expressly designated for administering potions and
for other ritual acts are the two regularly occurring planetary
events, the conjunction and the opposition of the Sun and the
Moon. These are of course, in lay terms, the nights of the new
moon, a time when a solar eclipse'may occur, and of the full
moon, that is, the middle of the month, when a lunar eclipse
may occur.
Both dates repeatedly appear in medical texts. The night of
the new moon is recommended as the time when an herb against witchcraft is to be ingested in beer;622another herb is
to be used for purifying the man at new moon's day, by putting
it into water and exposing it to the stars,623and still others by
placing it around the patient's neck or giving it to him to eat
at new moon's day.624 A particularly precise instruction
directs: "put a potsherd lying in the street [and other mate
rials?]into first-qualitybeer, drink (it) at new moon's day facing
the sun."625Moonless nights are, as we saw, particularlyappro
priate for gathering herbs. Thus, an instruction, unfortunately
naturally to the season, and comparable to the importance of the rising of
Sothis (i.e., Sirius) in signaling the flood of the Nile in Egypt, or to the rising
of Sirius observed for the timing of agriculturaltasks in the NabateanAgri
cultureas noted by D. Chwolsohn, Die Ssabierund der Ssabismus(St. Peters
burg, 1856) vol. 2 p. 912. The relevance of the Old Babylonian letter for the
identification of the oleiferous plant was most recently adduced by Miguel
Civil, TheFarmer'Isnstructions.A SumerianAgriculturalManual(Sabadell [Bar
celona], Spain: Editorial AUSA, 1994) with reference to the discussion by
Marvin Powell, Aula Orientalis9 (1991) 155-64.

(presumably of the evil) and offered to the sun, Samas.627
An effigy is also used in a ritual to be performed at the first
sighting of the new moon, a favorablemoment as the subscript
tells us: "Incantationto recite in order to turn the evil into good
at the first visibility of the moon."628
The effigy to be fashioned, at moonrise, is called here not
with the usual term 'figurine' or 'statue(tte)'629but passu

the third as a "female doll"632Whose effigy the "doll" repre

angry god (dingir.sa.dib.bgaur.ru.da).The second (BAM316) is a large tablet
with three columns on each side; it enumerates a number of afflictions, seem
ingly psychological; the ritual appears toward the end, and is followed by
the words "the evil of dreams and (other) evil signs," a phrase that may rep
resent the final rubric. The purpose of the third ritual (LKA25 ii) and the

text ends here and its parallel634is followed by a ritual against
evil dreams, in the third text635the ritual is followed by a
prayerto Orion, fragmentaryto be sure, but evidently imploring
the constellation to avert illness: "O Orion [. . .], who drives
away illness [.. .], you are high in the sky, you rise [... ], vertigo

The full moon also has a role in nocturnal rituals. The day
of the opposition of Sun and Moon may vary from the 13th to
the 16th, but in the schematic month of 30 days it is set for the
15th. To cure the affliction named ZI.KU5.RU.DAli,terally "cut
ting the breath,"63t7he patient addresses a prayer to the Moon
god Sin, presents an offering and recounts his affliction to Sin

Moon on the 15th day are also recommended in the hemerol
ogies.639A remedy for the ears is to be prepared on the 15th
of the sixth month640while the next recipes prescribe that the
treatment be performed on the 1st of the third month and
the 11th of the eighth month respectively.641
For some rituals it is essential that both planetary deities,
the Sun and the Moon, be equally present. That time is when
the full moon sets and the sun rises, at dawn of the day of the
opposition of Sun and Moon, in the middle of the month (usu
ally expressed as the 15th day); this is the time for carrying out
a ritual against the spirits of the dead that haunt a man.642The
aim of the ritual is to gain deliverance from afflictions caused

when moon and sun are equally present."644The exorcist
"clothes the patient in a dirty? garment, draws his blood by
slashing his forehead with an obsidian (knife), has him sit
down in a reed hut, has him face north, makes an incense offering of juniper and libates cow's milk to Sin toward 'sunset,
and makes an incense offering of 'cypress' and libates fine beer
to Samas toward 'sunrise.' Then the patient recites as follows:
'To my left is Sin, the crescent of the great heavens,645to my
right the father of mankind,646Samas the judge, the two gods,
ancestors (lit. fathers) of the great gods, who determine the lots
for the far-flungpeople. An evil wind has blown at me, the per
secuting ghost persecutes me, so that I am worried, I am trou
bled, disturbed (as I face) your verdict. Save me so that I not
come to grief.'He recites this seven times, leaves the reed hut,
changes his clothes, puts on a pure garment, speaks to Sin as
follows: 'Incantation: Sin, light of heaven and earth, take away
my sickness!' He speaks this three times and speaks to Samas
as follows: 'Samas, great judge, father of mankind,647let the
evil wind that has settled on me rise to heaven like smoke, and
I will sing your praises'-he speaks this three times and does
not [. .].648

The situation is quite clear, even though the ritual does not
specify the time when it is to be performed. Since the moon
is in the west, that is, setting, and the sun rising in the east,
we have here a dawn ceremony.
Appeals to stars and planets as the deities' astral manifesta
tions are known from two late rituals, the New Year'sritual in Babylon and a ritual performed in the temple of Anu in Uruk.
Among the deities addressed in the New Year's ritual in
Babylon649are the goddess Sarpanitu (the consort of Marduk,
chief god of Babylon) in her astral manifestation,650also the
Square of Pegasus,651 Mudrukesda,652 and the star of Eridu;653
they are followed by the planets Jupiter,654Mercury,655Saturn
here called, with an epithet elsewhere reserved for Libra, Star
of justice656-and Mars,657 and the stars Sirius,658 Arcturus,659
NE.NE.GAR,66N0umusda,661Antares,662and finally the Sun and

Marduk), and his consort Beltiya in lines 318ff. addresses the
goddess (lines 325-32) as the planet Venus or as one of its mani
festations as a fixed star: the Bow (MUL.BAN),the Goat (MUL.

nity (MiUL.BAL.TES.At)h,e Wagon (MUL.MAR.GiD.DA)C, oma

In the temple of Anu at Uruk in a nocturnal ceremony664
offerings are made on the 16th (of a month that is not identified
in the preserved portions of the ritual)to the heavenly manifes
tations of the temple's main deities: to 'Anu of the sky" and
"Antuof the sky" as well as to the seven planets,665and in the
same text daily offerings are made to 'Anu and Antu of the sky"
and to the seven planets, now named in the sequence Jupiter,
Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Mars, the rising of the Sun and the
sighting of the Moon.666
The heavenly manifestations of Anu and Antu are, for Anu,
a star belonging to the constellation Mudrukesda (a Dra
conis?) and, for Antu, a star in the constellation Ursa Maior.667
The text itself specifies: "as soon as the star of Great Anu of the
sky rises, (and?) Great Antu of the sky rises in the Wagon."668
The most elaborate ritual performed at night with appeal to
the stars is the "washing of the mouth" (mis pi). It deals with
the all-important ceremony of breathing life into the statues of
the gods, a process called empsychosis in Greek. In Babylonia,

ASTRAL MAGIC IN BABYLONIA
the ceremony is called the "opening of the mouth" (pTtpt),
which is preceded by the "washing of the mouth" (mTspi) of the
divine statue. Divine statues, we know, were made of wood,
and overlaid with precious materials, usually gold; incrusta
tions of precious stones adorned them.669Their fabrication
was, therefore, placed under the tutelage of the patron gods of
carpenters, goldsmiths, and jewelers. Only after the inert ma
terials were infused with breath through the mouth-opening
ceremony could the statue eat and drink the offerings, and
smell the incense.670 The vivification of the divine statue comprised several
stages. The first stage, the first mouth-washing, was conducted
in the workshop; then, the statue was carried in procession to
the riverbank, where a second mouth-washing took place. The
statue was first facing west, then facing east. Offerings were
made to the nine great gods, among whom are the major plan
etary gods, that is, Sun, Moon, and Venus; then to the nine
patron gods of the craftsmen; then to other planets and to cer
tain fixed stars and constellations, among them Sirius, Libra,
the Wagon, the Goat, and the Scorpion, and finally to the stars
rising over the three "paths"along the eastern horizon, that is,
all the stars.671The role of the astral deities in the ritual is not
specified; nevertheless, that role is clear from the description
of the venue, which is the river bank, and the time: at night,
as indicated by the fact that the procession advances by torch
light; the stars and planets were to irradiatethe statue crafted
of wood and adorned with precious metals and stones and
thus infuse these materials with their power. The offerings are

described with the words: "you set up a cultic arrangement672
to the god"; it seems that these "culticarrangements"or, as we
might say, "altars,"are the loci to which the astral god will
descend. It is to be noted that no specific connection is made
between the various materials of which the statue is made and the deity that presides over each. Only in Hellenistic times will
each planet be associated with a particular metal and stone.673
At the head of the offerings to astral deities stands Jupiter:
Youset up two altarsforJupiterand Venus- ditto(= you perform
the mouth-washing)
Youset up two altarsfor the Moon and Saturn-ditto
Youset up three altarsfor Mercury,Sirius,and Mars-ditto

The first seven offerings, in two groups of two and one of
three, are meant for the seven planets, even though the place
of the sun, Samas, is taken by Sirius in the last group, either
because he was included in the group of'nine gods enumerated

earlier in line 25 or simply because it is night. The next three
groups include the zodiacal constellations Libra(with its stan
dard epithet, Star of Samas) in the first group of six, Virgo in
the second group of four, and Pisces, Aquarius, and Scorpius
in the third group, also of four. Moreover,the northern constel
lations Triangulum (the Plow), Bootes (SU.PA),Ursa Maior (the
Wagon), Coma Berenices? (the Cluster), and Lyra (the Goat)
receive offerings in the first group, the Square of Pegasus and
the Northern Fish (the Swallow)-paired, as usual, with the
Southern Fish (the Star of Anunitu) -in the second group, and
the southern constellation Vela? (the Star of Eridu) in the
third. And finally, offerings are made to all the stars, collec
tively called "those of (the paths of) Anu, Enlil, and [Ea]."
While only the Late Babylonian version of the mouth
washing ritual describes in such detail the appeal to the stellar
powers, already the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon and Assurban
ipal speak of the initiation of the new cult statues as taking
place before not only the gods and the divine patrons of the
crafts by means of which these statues were made, but also
"before the stars of the sky,"as the texts expressly state.676In
the Assurbanipal-library version of the directions for the
mouth-washing ritual only the setting up of an offering table677
for dSAG.ME.GA(RJupiter)and an altarfor MUL.SU.PA(= Arc
turus?)and the incipits of the prayers to be addressed to them
are cited: "YouSulpaea"678to Jupiter, and "(You,)magnificent
one, 'Mountain' of the Igigu-gods"679to Arcturus?.680It was

nexion,'681 it is therefore only in the Babylonian, late version
that the process takes on the characterof what may already be
called "astral religion" while the Assyrian recension testifies
only to the belief in stellar irradiation, the effect of which has
permeated, as we saw, several crucial areas of Babylonian
science and religion.
