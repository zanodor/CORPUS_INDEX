Wherever the Lost Tribes roamed, the God of Israel appeared to bless them in spite of their rejection of His Holy Temple and the recognition of His divine authority, the legal jurist of Israel; the House of Judah. Though they appeared “lost” as they were identified as unknown peoples and tribes, they also continued to be blessed and remained in a state separateness that was different than all of the other 70 nations of the world. Were not the words of the Lord to the prophet Amos that the literal Lost Tribes of Israel would always be known and recognized by HaShem their God?
Scythian-Israelite Sword Case – 5th century BCE
Amos 9:9-10 – “Lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not a grain fall upon the earth.”
Even the concern of assimilation among the nations, their numbers of descendants who could trace their roots to their ancestral forefathers continued to grow. The cloud of non- recognition did not cover the “pupils” of HaShem’s (God’s) eyes, but rather man’s. The scholars, then as today, proclaimed their great understanding of the mysteries of the nations, but lacked wisdom in how to interpret them. With Israel being lost, and not visible to the international comprehension, many began to consider that they were “Spiritual Israelites”. They proclaimed that their religious roots, whether Roman Catholics, Mormons, Adventists, Evangelical Christians and even Islam sought to replace the ancient Hebrew-Judaic faith.

Albeit their own spiritual corruption, what these religious groups did not realize was that many of these individuals were Israelites, literally of the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel, but their spirituality had been compromised, their religion had been corrupted, and their concepts of the Divine had been tainted. Even today, the ancient Israelite is on a “homing mission” as we witness the vast spectrum of sincere spiritually focused Christians who are seeking to convert the Jews to Christianity and only find that they are being drawn closer and closer to their real identity; their Hebrew-Israelite-Judaic roots. The “Messiah” that Christians profess to worship and follow, many forget was an orthodox Jew, whose purpose of coming to this planet earth was, by His own admission, “to find the “Lost Sheep of the House of Israel.”

With the final acceptance and reconciliation with the House of Judah, the modern day orthodox Jew, these “Lost Israelites” will also reclaim their own destiny as their “dry bones” are reawakened from the wilderness of isolation from their own brethren and the God of their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Is it not only reasonable that the God of Israel would keep His own promises that He proclaimed through the “words” of the prophets:
Ezekiel 37:1,11, 19, 21-22 - “The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley’; and it was full of bones...Then He said to me, ‘Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They indeed say, ‘our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!...Surely I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick...Surely I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land; and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again.”
The challenge to all of us is whether we believe that the God of Israel means what He says. Do we have faith (emuna) in His sovereign power that He will accomplish what He promised that He would do. What is more striking is that as the Eternal One drove His own people from their homelands and scattered them over the face of the earth. He also began to rewrite His laws within their hearts and cloaked into them their hidden identity as He began to transform all the nations of this earth. For the prophets have spoken, and their voice resounding the voice of the Eternal One of Israel were not speaking of conditional prophecies, but prophesies that will be fulfilled as the God of Israel spoke to his people.

Jeremiah 29:14 – “I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you.”

This text demonstrates how the God of Israel works, even when His sovereign power is not recognized in the dynamic forces of reformation, regeneration, and reconciliation. He is there whether noticed or not. As the God of Israel led the Israelites, hidden beneath the tribal identity as the Scythians-Cimmerians-Celts, first moving towards Asia and then back to the Middle East, the Almighty eventually led them away from these lands to find their destiny in the lands farther to the west where they would remain until the days of the Messiah.
The Response of the Caring Almighty One of Israel
This concept of the God of Israel guiding the Lost Tribes of Israel, even when they were clueless of their destiny and wandered over the EuroAsia continent is Hebrew in its fullest extent. Their God was nearby and watching over them all the time.
This concept was earlier portrayed during the Inter-testament period after the era of the Hebrew prophets and before the era of the Jewish messiah, Yahshua. The Apocryphal Book of Esdras portrayed the wanderings of Israel in a vision in which a “man” was seen rising from the depths of the sea. It was announced by the Lord of hosts that this “man” was “He whom the Most High has held in readiness through many ages; He will himself deliver the world He has made.”
With all its messianic apocalyptic imagery, this vision portrayed the coming of the Messiah son of Joseph (Maschiach ben Yosef) who would come, not just to redeem his covenanted people, the Jews, but to restore the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel back into fellowship and oneness. As the Lord has promised, “All Israel will be saved!” Let us look at what happened to the Northern Kingdom of Israel in this vision.
11 Esdras 13:39-48 (Apocrypha) - "And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceable multitude unto him; those are the ten tribes which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea (Hosea), the king, whom Shalmaneser, the King of Assyria, led away captive; and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.

But they took this counsel among themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a further country, where never mankind dwelt, that they might there keep their statutes, which they never kept in their own land. And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow passages of the river; for the Most High then showed signs for them, and held still the flood till they were passed over. For through that country there was a great way to go, namely, of a year and a half; and the same region is called Arsareth. Then dwelt they there till the latter time; that is until the age of the
Messiah. (“Latter time” “age of the Messiah was in the 1st century BCE – CE Judea)”

One of the great scholars of the ancient Lost Tribes of Israel was E.P. Ingersol who wrote a booklet in the 1880s titled, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Race”. When a scholar, like John Heywood of Oxford, explored in depth the histories of Herodotus, he came to one conclusion, yet in the same time exposed Herodotus’ surprising identity, as reported by Ingersol:
Ingersol on John Heywood – “Herodotus, in his histories, confirms the account given by Esdras in every particular. And this Herodotus, who is he? Oxonlan (John Heywood) makes it appear that he (Herodotus)
was himself an Israelite of the tribe of Dan.” (E.P. Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Race, Chapter V)
For what we know of Herodotus, the wandering historian of the 6th century BCE, was that he was of Grecian descent. Yet, we have now learned that the Grecian isles were populated by the Tribe of Dan, known to Onias the High Priest as the Lacedemonians. Earlier the Danites participated in the coalition that destroyed the Citadel of Troy along with the Spartans, who also were from the Tribe of Dan. They became that formidable military city-state in Greece. As scholars now suspect, Alexander the Great was probably a descendant of the House of Dan, as also was the wandering historian, Herodotus, who may have come from the same genealogical tribal background.

When the appointed time of the God of Israel, the Nation of Israel that consisted of primarily eight tribes without the Tribes of Dan and Simeon, were led by the hand of the Lord out of Asia. This was the same unseen hand that led their fathers out of Egypt.
The Prophesy of the Wandering of the Israelite Scythians to Arsareth (Sarmatia)
5/42



If the Esdras prophesy of the rise of the “peaceful ones” was the resurrection of the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel that will arise in the days just before the final coming of the Messiah, then the author, Ingesol, emphatically portrays that this was not just an isolated prophecy but it was testified by not just one, two, but three witnesses.
E.W. Ingersol – “In the quotation from Esdras, the account of the captivity of Ten-Tribed Israel is identical with that in II Kings, 17; so that we have here the testimony of three witnesses of the captivity of Israel into Assyria, of their sojourn there, and of their removal thence. Of this removal, Herodotus and Esdras use almost the same language in rehearsing the events. But we now have yet more confirmatory evidence of the removal of Israel from Assyria to the "land uninhabited by man," a year and a half's journey distant." The Oxonian (John Heywood), in his history, has given maps in which is traced the line of the wanderings of Israel in all their journey, from their leaving the cities of the Medes on the River Gozan, and on the southwest coast of the Caspian Sea, till they reached the end of their journey at Arsareth.” (E.P. Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Race, Chapter V)
The Land of the Scythians and the Land of Arsereth as the Sarmatia
Ingersol then went on to verbally trace the wanderings of Israel:
E.W. Ingersol – “On these maps, which give the true geographical position of all the lands through which Israel passed, their road is marked by dotted line...This line leads first from their starting-point to the crossing of the Euphrates, high up in the mountains, the only pass known (Khyber Pass controlled by the Pashtun Bani-Israel Afghani Tribes in that region, which course is northwesterly. Here, Esdras says, "God kept back the waters till Israel had passed over!"...
After crossing the Euphrates, their course is north and northeast, then west to the Black Sea; thence in a northwesterly course, following the windings of the shores, till the Crimea is reached and passed through; then on in the same general course to Arsareth, which on an old map is discovered to be on the northwest coast of the Black Sea. Here at length Israel pitched their camp, after the journeying of a year and a half, a distance of' 1,500 miles in a direct line.
6/42



The exact date of' this removal is not yet known, but from the best data now in the possession of historians, it would seem that the settlement of Israel on the northwest coast of the Black Sea must have been at least 500 years B. C. (And here let it be borne in mind, Esdras says this was a "country uninhabited by man" -- clearly teaching that Europe, at least that part of Europe, had never been occupied by human beings.” (E.P. Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Race, Chapter V)
The land of Arsareth where the deported and now wandering tribes of Israel resided for almost five hundred years was, according to John Heywood’s maps recorded as follows:
John Heywood – This land “was “bounded on the east by the River Don (nee Dan), on the south by the Black Sea and the River Danube, on the west by the upper waters of the Vistula, by the Carpathian mountains, and the lower course of the River Sereth, to its mouth on the Danube.
The 178,000 square mile Black Sea fed by three main river, Don, D(a)nieper, and the D(a)niester on the north and the Danube on the west.
The north side was bounded by a low range of hills, parallel to the coast of the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, and extending nearly to the Baltic; a country about 500 miles square, giving an area of 250,000 square miles. And this is now known to be the most fruitful country in Europe; and in this fruitful country these Israelites sojourned at least 500 years -- probably more. But, it seems, they never regarded this as their home; they were still seeking a place of rest, from which they would be no more removed till their final removal back to the land of their captivity; for they still had the impression, (by what means so ever obtained,) that their removal from Canaan and "being scattered among all the nations" was not to last forever; although they had no knowledge of the prediction uttered by Isaiah, that they were to be planted in the isles of the sea. (Isaiah 41:1, etc.; Zechariah 2:6-13.)” (Cited by E.P. Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Race, Chapter V)
Here upon this fertile soil resides the modern Nation of Ukraine, called the “Breadbasket of Europe”. The fertility of this region has been known from antiquity. Yet, another most interesting legend is that this region of Arsareth appears to be the same region of the Sarmatians. Who were they and were they one and the same?

The Israelite-Scythian- Amazonian Sarmatians Sojourning in the Land of Sarmatia
The Sarmatians were a people who originated in the regions of the ancient Medes and the region of the early Persians that were known as Iranian or Aryan in origin. According to classical authors, they migrated from
Central Asia to the Ural Mountains in the 5th century BCE and settled in the southern regions of Russia, Ukrainia, and the eastern Balkans. According the Roman historian Pliny the Elder, these tribal peoples roamed from the Vistula River to the mouth of the Danube and eastward to the Volga River. Here in this region were the Don (Dan) River, the D(a)niester River and the D(a)nieper Rivers feeding into the Euxine Sea today known as the Black Sea. There they flourished from about the era of Herodotus (5th century BCE) to the era of the Mongolian Empire in the 12th century CE.
The oldest Samartian culture goes only to the 7th century BCE, according to the leading Soviet historian Boris Grakov whose culture was defined by the late Kurgan graves and part of the nomadic steppe culture stretching from the Black Sea to the Volga River. Strange as it seems , this Kurgan culture appears to be identical to the Israelite-Scythian culture of the same era between the 7th to the 4th century BCE.
Most prominent of this Scythian-Saka-Sibirian culture was the Early Iron Age mound culture seen all across the Eurasian continent in which the Scythians used them for burials for the royal and nobility. These Kurgans burial mounds were enormous from 500 meters in height in Siberia to 5000 meters in height of the 1st
Emperof of China in the 3rd century BCE Sian . The heights of some were closer to the height of a seven story building, the largest for the Chinese emperor over 100 meters in height.

It was from Herodotus in his Histories 4.21 who wrote of the legendary Sauromatians that claimed that they were a race which mixed the Scythian male warriors with the Amazon female warriors in which their
8/42



descendants were blond, stout and tanned akin to the appearances of the Scythians and the Thracians. According to the legend, a band of young Scythian (Israelite) men met a group of Amazon women when they were captured in battle by the Greeks on Pontus in northern Turkey near the River Thermodon. The Amazons were reputed to have lived in Pontus along the southern shore of the Euxine Sea (Black Sea) as an independent kingdom under the rule of Queen Hippolyta (Hippolyte) which meant a “loose, unbridled mare”. The towns in their kingdom included Smyrna, Ephesus, Sinope and Paphos. According to Aeschylus the dramatist, the Amazonians once lived at Palus Maeotis (Lake Maeotis) and later moved to Thermodon on the Terme River in northern Turkey. It was there that Herodotus called them Androktones or “killers of men”.
The female captives were loaded into boats and at sea they overcame their captors, but had one problem. They were not experienced boaters. Their ship was blown off course in the Euxine (Black) Sea when a storm arose and blew them into the Maeotian Lake (Sea of Azov) near the Crimean Peninsula and upon the shore of Scythia near the region of the cliffs in southeastern Crimea.
These young Amazon women learned the Hebrew Scythian language and even agreed to enter into a marriage agreement under one condition; they had to move away and not follow the customs of the Scythian-Israelite women. According to Herodotus, the descendants of this Scythian-Amazon union returned back to the northeast beyond the Don River and there became Sauromatians. According to Herodotus, the language of the Sauromatians was an impure form of the Hebrew Scythian language.

This legend has many interesting features in the context that the Lost Tribes of Israel may have been the Israelite-Scythian movement from region between the Black and the Caspian Seas. Their existence and
identity began in the same era of the 7th century BCE, a region in which earlier scholars claim was devoid of any inhabitation. The women’s origins were not known but the men were probably of Israelite descent from the region of Samaria. For over one century, they lived along the Don (Dan) River near the city of Samara (similar to Samaria) in the region of Sarmatia Asiatica and then later moved westward for 1500 miles over a year and a half until they settled again on the northwestern regions of the Black Sea in what was known as Sarmatia Europaea.

The “Amazonian” women were partly assimilated into the Israelite-Scythian culture for awhile and learned

their Hebrew language in a corrupted form as noted by Herodotus. They were also of non-tribal Israelite descent and no doubt would not have been accepted by the Israelite women, and so did not or did not feel comfortable becoming part of the Israelite Scythian culture. The Israelites may have been still observant of many commands of the Torah as did the Jews did in this same era when the Jews returned back to Jerusalem from their Babylonian-Persian exile. As the Jewish cleric scribe Ezra commanded the Jews to return their foreign wives back to their homelands in disgrace so the Israelite males may have chosen to leave their tribal Israelite Scythian families and live separately with their new Amazonian wives.
Like the Jews, the Israelites even as they were in the process of time of becoming “lost” to their identity and culture, the purity of their race would have suggested, that for their children to be Israelites, their mothers would have to be Israelites. So the children of the Amazonian wives would not have been accepted into the Scythian-Israelite culture and be looked upon as bastard children. Even so, the name of their descendants carried a clue to their identity, for as Sarmatians, their paternal ancestors formerly came from the region of Samaria, the land of the Israelite Samaritans.
During this five hundred years (6th century to the 1st century BCE), the Saka-Scythian Israelite sons of Isaac, settled in one area in Sarmatia living a nomadic lifestyle with the old men, women and children tending to the flocks and herds and tilling the soil with remarkable skills as farmers. The men as warriors continued to explore and extend the extent of the lands under the wandering Israelite control. According to Herodotus:
Herodotus – “About 438 B.C., the Scuths extended their dominion to the eastern side of the Kimmeria Bosphorus, or Straits of Yenckaleh. This territory they held till 304 B.C. From 393 B.C. to 353 B.C., the Seuthic corn trade rose to an unprecedented height. The ordinary trade with Athens was 600,000 bushels, and on one occasion as much as 3,150,000 bushels were shipped for the same place from one port in the Crimea (Scythian land on the Northern Shores of the Black Sea).” (Herodotus, “Histories”, cited by Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Tribe, Chapter 5 ”)
The Tombstone and Tumuli Imprint of the Israelite-Scythians
The imprint of the Lost Israelites living in the Crimean Region above the Black Sea was discovered in the ancient cemeteries in which numerous tombstones with Hebrew-Phoenician inscriptions engraved were found. Seven hundred of these inscriptions were deciphered by a Professor Chwolsenof Petrograd and recorded in the archeological records. These striking tombstones that gave their Hebrew names and dates today reside in the Museum of St. Petersburg. The script as noted by Haberman was “not square Hebrew but marks a transition from the Phoenician characters to the later Hebrew”. These tombstone engravings include:

1. "This is the tombstone of Buki, the son of Izchak, the priest. May his rest be in Eden at the time of the salvation of Israel. In the year 702 of our exile." - If the date of the exile began in the year of 717 BCE, then this tombstone was created in the year of 15 BCE.
2. “To one of the faithful in Israel, Abraham ben Mar-Sinchah of Kertch, in the year of our exile 1682, when the envoys of the Prince of Rosh Meschek came from Kiou to our Master Chazar Prince David, Halmah, Habor and Gozan, to which place Tiglath Pileser had exiled the sons of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and permitted to settle there, and from which they have been scattered through the entire coast, even as far as China.” – Here again was archeological confirmations of the “wanderings” of the Lost Tribes of Israel, except the date would have to have been from the date of the Exodus (1486 BCE) of which would give us a date of the tombstone in the year of 197 CE.
3. "Rabbi Moses Levi, died in the year 726 of our exile."
"Zadok the Levite, son of Moses, died 4000 after the creation, 785 of our exile." (Frederick Haberman, “Tracing our Ancestors”, 1930s, pg 130)
These tombstones were not from the descendants of the Russian Jews who were driven out of Spain in the
5th century CE, but were descendants of the Lost Israelites who were known by a multitude of names; Sakasuni, Saki, Guti, Getai, Sak-Geloths, Skuthai, Skoloti, and the Scythians. These names were also confirmed by Herodotus who identified that the Scythians rose from the loins of the Sakai, or the Saxones, who “came from the country of the Medes”. It was Aeschylus, the Greek poet and the poet, Albinus who wrote:
Aeschylus – “The Sacae were noted for good laws, and were predominately a righteous people.”
Albinus – “The Saxons were descended from the ancient Sacae of Asia, and that in process of time they came to be called Saxons.” (Frederick Haberman, “Tracing our Ancestors”, 1930s, pg 130)
In the region of Southern Russia, there were discovered many tumuli or kurgans that archeologists have now excavated and are now known to be the burial places of the Royal Scythians. In many of them, the interiors were lines with white marble. Frederick Haberman wrote about these excavations and the exquisite reliefs, furnishings, golden jewelry as reported the American Journal of Archeology of 1914, Vol, XVIII and the Illustrated London News in January 3 and February 14, 1914. As reported :
11/42



Frederick Haberman – “In these (tumuli) were found chariots, pottery, jewelry, bracelets, gold, and precious stones of the finest workmanship of greatest abundance. The finest of those tumuli is that of the Solokha in the Crimea, which served as a mausoleum for the Scythian kings for several centuries. This tomb contained magnificent furnishing of silver and gold.
One of the royal skeletons found in it wore a heavy golden necklace with lion headed ends. Couching lions are also very prominent on the exquisite repousse relief work of solid gold, adorning the walls and on the various gold and silver ornaments found, as well as on the handles and sheaths of the swords, which themselves were made of fine steel. The repousse relief work pictured mostly battle and hunting scenes, on which the warriors appear in chain mail coats. It is also noteworthy that they are not bare-legged like the Greeks of that period were, but are wearing trousers. All the ornamental design is of most unusual excellence.” (Frederick Haberman, “Tracing our Ancestors”, 1930s, pg 129)
It was Professor Hebert Hannay, who wrote in his 1915 book titled, “European and other Race Origins”, about a Hebrew manuscript that was excavated from one of these tumuli in the Crimean region above the Black Sea, which stated:
Professor Hebert Hannay –“I am Jehudi the son of Moses, the son of Jehudi the Mighty, a man of the Tribe of Naphatali, which was carried captive with the other tribes of Israel, by the Prince Shalmaneser, from Samaria during the reign of Hoshea, King of Israel. They were carried to Halah, to Habor – which is Cabul – to Gozan and to the Chersonesus – which is the Crimea.” (Hannay, Herbert B. 1915. “European and Other Race Origins”, London: 1915 cited by Frederick Haberman, “Tracing our Ancestors”, 1930s, pg 129)
The Behistun Inscription of King Darius of Persia
In one original archeological site was found a primary manuscript of antiquity, found in its original site and location. It reported that the grandson of one of the Israelites deported from Samaria was sent to the region of the River Gozan. His father was part of the migration to the region of Arsareth in the northwestern land of Sarmathia. He was now living in the region of the Crimean peninsula along the northern border of the Black Sea, when he gave his testimony and historical identity.
The Sakki-Cimmerian Israelite Migrations
According to E. Raymond Capt in his extensively documented book, titled, “Missing Links Discovered in
12/42



Assyrian Tablets”, wrote about the famous Behistun Rock Inscriptions by King Darius of Persia and gave us these comments:
E. Raymond Capt – “The dominant feature of the Behistun Rock inscriptions is King Darius, in royal attire and surrounded by captives. Around the captives are five main panels, twenty in all. The first panel contains 19 paragraphs and 96 lines. Each paragraph commences with the words: “I am Darius, the king of kings, the king of Persia.” The second panel has 16 paragraphs and 96 liens ; over each figure is a brief history of the man and the tribe he represents. The tenth panel is most interesting to a Bible student because it speaks of “Sarocus, the Sacan”, who has the Hebrew form of head-dress.
The Gold Cuneiform Plate Inscriptions of King Darius at Persepolis
Most noteworthy is King Darius majestically standing before nine persons united by a rope around their necks and their hands fastened behind their backs. A tenth man is prostrate on his back; the right foot of the king is upon his body. No two of the prisoners are dressed alike. Some of them have short tunics, others have long flowing robes. They are evidently the head chiefs of the ten tribes of Israel. The word “Kana” occurs 28 times in the inscription and the word “Armenia” also occurs frequently. This is the area when the tribes of Israel had been placed by the Assyrians.
The inscriptions include a list of 23 nations over whom Darius ruled and named among these are the “Sakkas.” In both the Persian and Elamite version of the original word is “Sakka”, but in the Babylonian version the same people are called “Gimiri.” (Verified on behalf of the British Museum by L.W. King and R.C. Thomson, “Sculptures and Inscriptions of Behistun”, pg. 161 cited by E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 139)
13/42



The same identity between the Gimiri, the Ghumerians, Ghomerians, Cimmerians and the Sakkas was also found in a gold tablet that was a foot square of which King Darius wrote that gave evidence that the as late as 500 BCE a part of the Sakka were living beyond the regions of Bactria and dwelt all the way into the far eastern regions of the Upper Jaxartes Basin.
King Darius on Gold Tablet – “This kingdom that I hold is from Sakka which is beyond Sogdiana to Kush (Ethiopia) and from India to Sardis.” (E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 140)
The Cliff Tomb of King Darius I in the Valley of Naksh-i-Rustam
Yet, a third evidence of the identity of the Gimiri (Cimmerians) and the Sakka (Sacae) was found upon a trilingual inscription found on the Tomb of King Darius in southwestern Persia that was cut into the face of a cliff in the valley of Naksh-i-Rustam, nearby to the Persian capital at Persepolis. On this tomb inscription was also a list of the nations over which King Darius ruled. These nations included the identity of three separate groups of “Sakkas”; the “Amyrgian Sakkas”, the “Sakkas with the pointed caps” and the “Sakkas who are beyond the seal.” (E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 140)
Not truly appreciated in all of these inscriptions, the Babylonian text inscriptions do not record them as “Sakka” as the Persians did, but with the Babylonian name of “Gimiri” or “Ghomeri” with the identity to King Omri the father of the Israeli King Ahab and father-in-law to Queen Jezebel, who was the princess granddaughter of the Phoenician King and ally of King David; King Hiram of Tyre.
According to the Archeologist E. Raymond Capt, the “Iskuza”, “Sakka”, “Scythians”, the “Cimmerians” and the “Gimiri” were all Israelites but all did not migrate into Europe proper in the same migration pathways. The Cimbri or the Cimmerians arrived, according to Capt, in the southwestern regions of the Black Sea ahead of the Scythians that came later. He identified the Sarmatians, who BibleSearchers had identified earlier as possibly being part of the greater Israelite-Scythians migrations, as actually invaders intruding upon the Israelite-Scythian homelands above the Black Sea. They came down from the rich grasslands of the EuroAsian steppes by the growing desertification of these regions along with the expansion of the Chinese empires to the east, under the name of the “Sauromatae”.
It appeared that they were a mixed Iranian stock that combined features of many Late Bronze Age cultures that according to Herodotus’ writings claimed that their homeland was “three days journey east of the Don River, and three days journey northwards from the Sea of Azov” (by the Crimean Peninsula north of the Black Sea) and were a people that “use the Scythian language, speaking it corruptly.”

A nomadic people like the Scythian Israelites, the Sarmatians “wore trousers and pointed caps. Their wives retained the “ancient Amazon” mode of living, joining their husbands in the hunt and in war, and
wearing the same dress as the men. No virgin was permitted to marry until she had killed an enemy.” (E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 169)
The Scaled “Body Armor” of the Sarmatian Israelite Warriors
According to BibleSearchers, these Sarmatians sound more like the Scythian-Israelites who captured a group of Amazonian female warriors, married them, and due to non-acceptance by the Israelite females, keeping the Torah customs of marrying only within the tribal or Israelite culture, moved outside of the primary Israelite-Scythian culture.
Either way, as the Israelite Amazonian tribes expanded and grew stronger over the centuries, they push into the tribal regions of the Scythian-Israelites, in essence, by the year of 338 BCE, as Alexander the Great was expanding his empire from Macedonia to the east, the Sarmatians crossed over the Don (Dan) River regions, engaged their close cousins who began again to migrate to the west, disappearing into the regions west of the Dnieper River. Within another 30 years (300 BCE) the Sarmatians again pushed westward beyond the Dnieper to the regions near the Carpathian Mountains. They finally settled down within the regions of Hungary while the Scythian again pushed westward splitting this time into the Northern Scythians and the Southern Scythians.
The land of the Anglo-Saxons, known as the Scythians between the Black Sea and the Danube River
According to the Greek historian Strabo, filling in a little more of the historical details, the Scythian-Israelites moved to the north possibly near the “ocean” as the Baltic or the North Sea.
Greek Historian Strabo – “Of the portions thus divided, the first is inhabited in the region toward the north and the ocean by the Scythian nomads and wagon dwellers, and south of these by the Sarmatians.” (Strabo, XI, ii, 1 cited by (E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 170)
The Pliny the Elder in his “Natural History” wrote in the early years of the Christian era about several islands that existed in the “Northern Ocean” off the coastline of Scythia. The name of one of these islands was called “Baunonia” which Pliny states lies “off Scythia at a distance of a day’s voyage from the coast, on the beach of which in spring time amber is cast up by the waves.” Also in the region, “three days” sailing from the same 15/42



Scythian coast there was an enormous island called “Balacia”, which could have been the Island of Scandinavia with its two modern nations of Norway and Sweden.
Farther south into central Europe in the region from the Danube to the Baltic Ocean Pliny wrote:
Pliny - “The name of the Scythians is everywhere changed to that of Sarmatae and Germans, and his old designation has not been continued for any except the most outlying sections of this nation who live almost unknown to the rest of mankind (Pliny, IV, xii, cited by E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 170)
As archeological grave sites have depicted, prior to 100 BCE, the land that bordered on the southern coastline of the Baltic Sea where we now see the nations of Poland and Germany now only sparsely
populated. The inhabitants cremated their ancestors and stored the ashes in urns. Afte r the 1st century BCE when the Hasmonean era of royal rule was being displaced by King Herod the Great and the Roman domination, the archeological evidence of the arrival of the Scythian Israelites with their burial by inhumination (burial without cremation) with timbered tombs and wooden chambers for the royal or chieftain’s grave also now contained that person’s personal belongings such as gold and silver ornaments and weapons.
The Hallstatt and La Tene Israelite Cultures
One of the strangest of mysteries about unknown but advanced cultures that immediately resurrected itself in Central Europe in the 2nd and 1st century BCE, were the Hallstatt Culture (7th to 3rd century BCE) and the La Tene
Culture (3rd to 1st century BCE). Most historians agree to the invasions of the Celtic-Scythians who moved from the regions of the Black and the Caspian Sea that were later known to the Romans as the Celtic and the people of Gaul.
The Irrsee Lake and Village of Hallstatt in Austria
When they had arrived, they were pushed or eventually took the divine notion to continue moving westward, one of the branches eventually became known as the Cimmerians, for they were the ancient Ghomerians from the House of Omri in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. They headed north of the Carpathian Mountains and continued in a northwest path along the Vistula River to the “Low Countries” of Belgium and Holland and the north-western sectors of modern Germany. There along the North Sea and the Black Sea, known to them as the “German Ocean” the “Cimri” nestled into their new homes in the Jutland peninsula region that was called “Cimbric Chersonesus”. It was Putarch who wrote in his “Life of Marius” the following:
16/42



Plutarch – “They were called at first Cimmerians and then, not inappropriately, Cimbri.” (Plutarch, cited by E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 141)
This fact was collaborated by Poseidonius, the Stoic philosopher when he noted how the Cimbri were dwelling along the Black Sea where they had been formerly known to the Greek as the “Cimmerians”.
The Hallstatt Culture within the large La Tene Cultural Region of Europe
A larger part of the entering Scythian Israelite hordes into Europe moved south below the Carpathian Mountains along the Danube River westward through Hungary and Austria into the southern regions of France and Germany. They became known as the “Celts” but to the Romans as “Gauls”. As early as the 7th to the
6th centuries, martial warrior groups of these Celtic tribes, according to Capt, first settled in Bohemia and Bavaria. There they left their imprint for with their deceased royalty and warriors they entombed them under wooden built chambers beneath earthen mounds with their bronze and iron swords. It is these remains that archeologists have been in dispute, but have collectively given them the name of the “Hallstatt Culture” between the years of 700 to 500 BCE.
Burial Tumulus of the Celtic People of the Hallstatt Culture in Central Europe
These ancient peoples were believed to have settled in the 7th to the 5th centuries, several centuries before the arrival of the larger Cimmerian and Scythian Israelite hordes into Europe. There in the region of
Salzhammergut, Austria, there was found in the 19th century a large and very rich trove of iron and bronze weapons, bronze vessels, harnesses including decorated Greek and Etruscan pottery. These same styles of tumuli would later be discovered in Sarmatia and identified with the Scythians and known as the Scythian Israelites. The “Proto-Celts” as they were called, built crude mud and wattle homes but also many of the more prosperous farmers had homes with multiple dwellings, animal barns, stables and work areas whose roofs were thatch but the framework of the buildings were carefully made with jointed timbers and floors of packed sand.
17/42



They became wealthy from the production and export of salt from the springs at the head of the Salzkammergut Valley in Austria and with their income were able to accumulate iron, hence the quick transfer from the European bronze to the Iron culture that the Hebrew Kings of Unified Israel transferred from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age two to three centuries before around 1000 BCE.
Celtic Gold Coins from the La Tene Culture in the 3rd century BCE settlement at Oppidum of Manching in Bavaria, Germany that lasted until 50-30 BCE.
As the Celts expanded into Europe they created numerous rural settlements that were closely related to each other in family and social obligations and relationships. These also included religious rituals that included votive deposits found at La Tene at the northeastern region of Lake Neuchatel, north of the Swiss and Italian Alps.
These same votive objects were also found in chieftain tombs
dating back to the 5th century and included in other tomb sites with drinking vessels, helmets, chariot fittings, bronze and gold artifacts that included neck jewelry, torques and bracelets tracing as far west into Britain and Ireland.
The Entry Gate at Oppidum of Manching in Bavaria, Germany forming one of the largest Celtic villages north of the Alps.
The later La Tene homes were more sophisticated. They formed their wood bracings by using iron clamps on the framework of their homes. Scholars then noted the evolution of the small hearth heaters in the Hallstatt homes to primitive fireplaces with chimneys in the La Tene homes. The overall culture of the primitive Celt carries such intimate similarities to ancient Hebrew and later Jewish and Israelite cultures that BibleSearchers see them as one and the same.
The Celtic-Israeli Style Village Layout
From their rural types of communities, their tribes, like Israel of old that lived by the martial and warrior lifestyle, their graves for their ruling and warrior elite with burial mounds where personal artifacts of gold, bronze and iron, that included votive objects for worship all speak to a similar culture.
Then we find their close related communities and tightly knit social relationship that prevented them from marrying outside of clans and tribal family units, and amalgamating with the other cultures of the world. They lived in small farms, with simple and primitive dwellings. Their tribes relied on static defenses on
18/42



hilltop fortifications, like their Jewish cousins today in Israel always build on top of hills and surrounding eminences.
Then we note the Scythian Israelite’s inability to fully domesticate and live a life style assimilating within other cultures where they could cohabitate with other nations and tribes of people. The ancient Israelites were known by their “wanderings” for centuries and were always inclined for hunting and warfare. We see hints of that ancient Israeli culture within the inhabitants of the nations in Europe and American today. These could be the entrepreneur, the explorers of the world, and the trans-nationalists who travel the world on business but rarely mix with the foreign cultures of which they are visiting or habiting. It suggests that the Hallstatt, La Tene and the later Celtic cultures were all one and the same people, the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel who had migrated but continue to live as wanderers to this very day.
Archeologist E. Raymond Capt mused upon these findings in his book, “Missing Links discovered in Assyrian Tablets” which we read:
E. Raymond Capt – “From the opening of the fourth century BC, when the Celtic tribes invaded northern Italy, these people come close within the range of written history so that archaeological evidence can be filled out through the observations of Greek and Latin writers. The Roman historian Sallust, in recording the series of defeats of the Romans at the hands of the Cimbri, stated they were “Gauls.” Other Roman historians repeatedly spoke of the Cimbri as a “Celtic tribe.” Seemingly modern historians have been unable to accept the clear and consistent historical witnesses to the effect that the Cimbri in Jutland and the Celts and Gauls in France have a common ancestry in the Cimmerians who had once been known to the Greeks on both sides of the Black Sea.”
The Israelite-Cimmerian Scythians and Imperial Rome
The land of Sarmatia is today in modern Ukrainia and is known for its great fertility. But Sarmatia would not
be the Israelite-Scythians’ last resting place. By the 3rd century BCE, the Celtic Cimmerian people, known as the “Gauls” to the Romans began to fill the entire regions of Central Europe and Northern Italy. These ancient Israelites became so numerous that the Italians began to get concerned. The tribes crossed over the Alps and the Apennine Mountain range that traversed the length of Italy from north to south along its eastern coastline. They began to encroach upon the Latin homeland of the Roman descendants of the House of Esau, the Edomites. It was not long before the Cimmerian Israeli Gauls began to make thrusting raids into central and southern Italy.
According to Archeologist E. Raymond Capt, it was the wandering Israelite Gauls that destroyed the Etruscan power and culture in Italy, that were the predecessors of Rome and exceeded Rome in culture and civilized statehood. It was Brennus or “Bran” who sacked ancient Rome and burned it down it in the year of 390 BCE.
Every time the Romans faced the Israeli Gauls, the Romans armies were destroyed, that is until the Battle of Sentinum. The Cimmerian Gauls were allies and fought alongside with the Samnium people in central Italy when they met 40,000 Roman troops pitted against 50,000 of the allied powers in the year of 295 BCE. On that date, Rome destroyed the Samnium culture as the formidable Israelite Cimmerian charioteers of the Gauls were routed by the Romans. Only 12,000 Israelite troops survived the onslaught.

It was in the year of 280 BCE the vast hordes of the Israelite Gauls ravaged the regions of Phrygia that later was called Galacia. It was to these regions that later the Apostle Paul traveled (Acts 16:6), knowing that these people were from the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel. When Paul was writing his Epistle to the Galatians, he was actually writing to a race of Celtic people who were Cimmerian Israelites. It was Professor George Rawlinson (1812- 1902) who wrote:
Professor George Rawlinson – “These two great invasions into Asia Minor proceeded from the same identical race,” (Appendix. Bk. iv) in the first instance called “Cimmerians”, in the second, “Gauls.”
Professor George Rawlinsons, Camden Professor of Ancient History at Oxford
In the 2nd century BCE, the wandering Israelite Scythians first came in contact with the expanding Roman imperial thrust for world domination. According to the Oxford trained author, John Heywood, in his 1885 book titled, “Israel’s Wanderings” he claims that the first recorded contact that the Israelite Scythians called the Kimbri Celts had with Roman forces came in the year of 113 BCE. The Scuths (Scythians known as the Kimmerians or the Kimbri Celts) were engaging in one of their southern wandering excursions when they met the Roman army under the leadership of the Roman consul, Cn. Papirius Carbo. The consul received the envoys of the Kimbri with great diplomacy and then sent them in a false direction from where they wanted to go. The Consul Carbo then took his troops and ambushed the Kimbri at a moment in which they were not expecting a battle. According to the histories, “They resisted boldly and at length the betrayed defeated the betrayer.”
The Roman army under Carbo suffered a major defeat when a sudden and fierce thunder storm enveloped the heavens with a darkened shroud. The two forces were separated by the darkness. The Roman army was routed and scattered across the land. According to Theodor Mommsen (1817-1909), that great classical Roman historian and Nobel Laureate in Literature in 1902 wrote in his “History of Rome” stating; “That storm alone prevented the complete annihilation of the Roman army.” It was in the hands of the Israelite-Kimbri Celts that they could have advanced into Rome and taken possession of that city, but the hand of the Lord used its restraining power for, “the Fourth Empire (of Daniel’s apocalypse) was not yet ripe for its final
doom.” (Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen, “History of Rome”, cited by John Heywood, “Israel’s Wanderings” pg. 79, cited by Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Tribe, Chapter 5 ”)
Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen, the Classical Roman Historian
Three years later, according to the many historical sources on the declining years of Rome especially from Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”, the Oxford trained Heywood wrote that the IsraeliteKimbri-Celts were again on excursion this time into the region of southern Gaul. This Kimbri tribal envoy requested of the Romans to provide them land in which to settle and live peacefully within the region. This
20/42



request was “contemptuously rejected”. Not only was the Kimbri request spurned but they were attacked by the Roman legions under the command of General M. Junius Silanus. The Roman army was crushed and disseminated and the entire Roman camp was taken in the Israelite Kimbri possession. (John Heywood, “Israel’s Wanderings” pg. 80) In spite of the stubbornness of the House of Israel to their God, the Lord’s prophetic utterances continued to be fulfilled.
Micah 5:8 – “Then the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among flocks of sheep, who, if he passes through, both treads down and tears in pieces, and none can deliver.”
Even then, the Kimbri could have moved again against Rome, but their attention was directed elsewhere and for a different and more divine destiny. According to John Heywood, he writes:
John Heywood – “These battles, commonly ascribed to the "Goths and Vandals," together with many more by the same people, are now known to have been fought by the Anglo-Saxons, then called Scuths, Kimbri, Sacra, and Engel all of which names are appropriated solely by the "Lost Tribes of Israel." And it is especially remarkable, that in all these twelve or thirteen battles, Israel was triumphant in all save one, which was said to have been a "drawn battle," "the time of Rome's utter fall having not yet come." (John Heywood, “Israel’s Wanderings” pg. 65, ch. VIII, and ch. X, p. 77, also ch. XI, pg. 84; cited by Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Tribe, Chapter 5”)
Heywood then gives his concluding remarks on the last of the Lost Tribes of Israel as they eroded the invincible power of the Roman Empire in the Germanic forest of Europe.
John Heywood – “In reviewing this subject I cannot refrain from giving a brief account of a battle of these very Israelites, called by the Romans the "Cherusi." The scene of this battle was between the headwaters of the Ems and Weser (Rivers), and called Saltus Teutobergiensis. This battle has been narrated by Sir E. Creasy, "as one of the decisive battles of the world." The leaders in this battle, A. D. 9, were Quintilius Varus, of the Roman legions, and Arminius, the leader of the Cherusi (the Israelites.) This battle, which lasted two days, was so fatal to the Romans that the tidings of it filled all Rome with an agony of terror, and Caesar Augustus was so alarmed that he often beat his head against the wall and exclaimed, "Qaintilius Varius, give me back my legions." The blow struck by Arminius was never forgotten. (John Heywood, “Israel’s Wanderings” pg. 65, ch. VIII, and ch. X, p. 77, also ch. XI, pg. 84; cited by Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Tribe, Chapter 5”)
According to E. W. Engersol:
21/42



E.W. Engersol – “In remarking upon this battle the historian says' "Had Arminius been supine or unsuccessful, our Germanic ancestors would have been enslaved or exterminated, in their original seats along the Eyder and the Elbe; this island would never have borne the name of England, and we, this great English nation, whose rule and language are now overrunning the earth from one end of it to the other, would have been utterly cut off from existence."
Arminius, the Israelite Cherusi Chieftain
Thus, once more are we able to lift the veil which covers those dark ages of tile world's history, and we see the "remnant of Jacob," which Jehovah had promised "should be a nation before Him forever;" again, with irresistible force and with lasting result, "treading down and tearing in pieces" the Roman, or fourth kingdom of Daniel. "There was none to deliver;" no Roman general ever avenged the destruction of the legion of Varus.
The emigration of these Israelites from their home in the northwest of the Black Sea, is not definitely known as to the time, but it was sometime as late as A. D., the first or second century, But the track of the migration is followed till they reached the Baltic, when some, a few of the wanderers, took ship and sailed away to Dan, in Denmark; while the main body settled in Germany, a place now called Saxony; a name now known to be the exact synonym of Saca-Suni, the old original name borne by these tribes while yet in Assyria.” (E.P. Ingersol, “Lost Israel found in the Anglo-Saxon Race, Chapter V)
In the 1st century, before the arrival of Rome’s Julius Caesar, the Israeli Cimmerian Gauls in the south allied themselves with the Teutons, who were the authentic or “genuine” Celtic Cymric Gauls to the north, and attacked the Romans. In five battles, the Gauls defeated the Romans with five different consuls, of which two were discussed above.
The Teutonic tribes of Gaul were decimated in the year of 102 BCE when over 200,000 Teutonic Israelite troops were destroyed by the Roman troops under the Roman Consul Marius. Then on July 30, 101 BCE, the Cimbri (Cimmerians Israelites), coming from the region of the Pyrenees Mountains north of Spain, met the Romans with Consul Marius in battle. They were not aware that their Israelite cousins to the north, the
22/42



Teutonic tribes they expected to rendezvous with them in battle had be destroyed the year before. When this battle was over, 120,000 Israelite Cimmerians were dead and 40,000 Israelis were led into captivity. After these two slaughters of the ancient
Israelites, the imperial might of Rome held sway until the 3rd century CE.

The road of “wandering” through the wilderness of EuroAsia as a trek of almost eight centuries was almost over. It was time to settle down and develop a culture and civilization that would become a potent economic power in the final days collaborating with their Jewish cousins in the final years of this earth’s historical era.
It would be these Israelites who would at the time of the end become impregnated with the messianic zeal of the Sabbatean
Jews in the 17th and 18th centuries in the British and Scottish Orders of the Freemasons, the Illuminati from Bavaria, the
Rockefeller Robber Barons of 19th century America , and the Rothschild agents of the American Federal Reserve System. They would rise up as the Israelite and Jewish NeoCon architects of the War against Terror during the Sabbatical Week of Years between the years of 2001 to 2008 and the Rothschild dominated architects of the International Banking and Monetary Collapse as Rosh Hashanah 2008 welcomed the current Sabbatical Week of Years that portends to be the last Seven Years before the coming of the Messiah between the years of 2008-2015.
The Golden Torques uses as Necklaces and Bracelets of Celtic Israelite Fame
These Ephraimite Israelites were imprinted with the ancient mission of the Jewish Messiah Yahshua HaNotzri (7BCE-30 CE), called Jesus the Nazarene. This mission to find the “Lost Sheep of the House of Israel”, first penetrated the future stronghold of the Anglo-Saxons [Engel Sacae (Ephraim of the House of Isaac)] by the early apostolic missions by Joseph of Arimathea and the Culdee Twelve Refugees to the Cymric Welsh and the British Cymric Druids on the Isle of Britannia. This was then extended by the mission to Ancient Gaul by the Apostle Philip along with Yahshua’s (Jesus’) 70 disciples, who along with the Bethany three, Lazarus, Mary Magdala and Martha evangelized the Southern Israeli Cimmerian Tribes of the Lost Tribes of Israel in the French provinces of Gaul.
The European Hidden Israelite Tribes soon became the global leaders of the world after the fall of secular
Rome’s domination of Europe in the 5th century fall of Rome by the Israelite Visigoths. Formerly fragmented 23/42



from the larger Ostrogoths, the Visigoths broke away and under the dynamic Israeli rule of Alaric the Bold. These Western Goths (Visigoths) invaded Italy in 400 CE and conquered Rome in the year of 410 CE.
Four years later, the Visigoths extended the range of their imperial quest by their conquest of France and later into Spain. The Visigothic rule would last in France for almost a century when they were defeated by Clovis at Vougle in the year of 507 CE. The Visigothic dominion would last in Spain for three hundred years until they were driven out by the Saracens under the rule of Musa, when the Islamic jihad set out to conquer Europe in 711 CE.
The German Scythian Roots of the Anglo-Saxons
Antiquarian studies of the Anglo-Saxons who did arrive into Britain depicted these peoples on the continent of Europe as “Germans” by the Roman Emperors who sought to no avail to gain total control of these regions. Prior to Britain, the Anglo-Saxons (Ephraim sons of Isaac) lived along the River Elbe at the base of the Jutland Peninsula (Denmark). There they were known by the Romans to be the “Germani” for in Latin, the word, “Germanius” actually meant “genuine”.
King Alfred of Wessex, England (849-899 CE)
When Nennius the British historian wrote about the arrival in the 5th century (about 449 CE), of the two brothers, Hengist and Horsa, he claimed that they descended from Odin in northern Germany. They were hired as mercenaries to fight for the Cymric British against the northern Picts and the Scots. During this time, it was written that Hengist and Horsa sent to Scythia in the region of modern Germany for “reinforcements”.
The Kingdoms of the English Heptarchy
The Story of Joseph of Arimathea and the Culdee’s (Refugee) Mission was a specific mission to find the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel. They established a Jewish Nazarene mission and yeshiva educational center in the Cornwall region of Britannia amongst the Cymric Welsh. This fact was highlighted by their main purpose; to train missionaries, or emissaries for the Jewish Messiah, to the regions of Roman Gaul, according to His divine mission, to find the “Lost Sheep of the House of Israel ”. Within 250 years of their entry onto the Isle of Britannia, the “wandering tribes of Israel” began to arrive upon the isle of Britannia.
First came the Saxon raids between the years of 280-450 CE. One of these Saxon warrior bands under the rule of King Cerdic, the founder of the famous Saxon dynasty in England, later gave to England, King Alfred the Great (849-899 CE), the King of the West Saxons (Wessex), or the King of the Anglo-Saxons. King Alfred created England’s first code of Law that was based strongly upon the ancient Torah Laws of Israel.
24/42



The entry of King Cerdic with his Scythian-Israelite warriors only highlights another mystery; the story of the British Cymric ruler, King Arthur in Wales, who defended the western land on the Isle of Britannia and denied King Cerdic dominion for over thirteen years. Yet, the Scythian Israelites as the AngloSaxons would gain domination over their tribal brothers, the Dans and the Simeonites known as the Cymric Brits, as new kingdoms sprouted up upon the English landscape.
King Egbert the Great (775-839 CE) of Wessex who Unified the Anglo-Saxons (Ephraim sons of Isaac) into Heptarchy rulership
The Kingdom of Essex (East Saxons) was formed in 530 CE. Then the Angles, as the Engels of the Tribe of Ephraim, landing in 527 CE following the Saxons, with the arrival of King Ida in 547 CE with forty ships on the southern border of Scotland. Then he founded the Kingdom of Bernicia that later became the Kingdom of Northumbria.
By the end of the 6th century, seven kingdoms, a “Heptarchy” ruled with chieftain allies in the English kingdoms of Kent, Susex (South Saxons), Wessex (West Saxons), Northumbria (North Saxons), Mercia, East Anglia (East Angles ) and Essex (East Saxons). These tribes now unified under the Heptarchy later brought all of these kingdoms under the one unified ruler; King Egbert of England.
Blessings of Jacob upon Ephraim (Great Britain) and Manasseh (United States)
The Anglo-Saxons had finally found their homeland. The prophets of old had foretold about Ephraim (Engel sons of Isaac) and the destiny of his descendants when the Patriarch Jacob blessed the grandsons by his favorite son, Joseph, the Viser of Pharaonic Egypt. In a private ceremony only with the three of them, Joseph had put his two sons standing in front of their grandfather Jacob; Manasseh to Jacob’s right side and hand, and Ephraim, to Jacob’s left side and hand.
Jacob blessing Joseph’s two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim
As Jacob blessed them, he did something strange. He crossed over his arms and put the right hand on the head of the younger son, Ephraim, and his left hand on the head of the older son, Manasseh. And then he blessed them.
Genesis 48:15-16 – “God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day, the Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads;
25/42



Let my name (Israel) be named upon them (Ephraim and Manesseh) and the name of my fathers Abraham (Ibrahim where the Hebrews were known as the Ibri, Ibiru, or Apiru) and Isaac (Yiṣḥāq whose descendant sons of Isaac were known as the Esaki, Isaki, Sacae, Sachi, Saki, or Sakka).”
Joseph protested but the Patriarch, firmly understanding what he was doing, proclaimed the future prophetic role of these two sons of Joseph, saying:
Genesis 48:19 – “And his father [Jacob (Israel) the Patriarch) refused and said, ‘I know, my son, I know . He (Manasseh as the United States) also shall become a people, and he also shall be great, but truly his younger brother (Ephraim as the British Empire) shall be greater that he (Manasseh as the United States), and his (Ephraim as the British Empire) descendants shall become a multitude of nations.”
Queen Victoria as Königin Victoria von England, 1845, Bild, Gotha, Schloßmuseum Schloß Friedenstein, Gemäldesammlung - Painting by Alexander Melville
In the future days, the House of Manasseh would become a “great people” embodied in the global and powerful nation of the United States of America. Yet, the House of Ephraim, the younger son, would become greater, for his descendants would
become a “multitude of nations” and prophetically realized in the 19th and 20th century British Empire that rose and reached its zenith under the rule of Queen Victoria, whose reign as the Queen lasted longer than any other British monarch; for 63 years and seven months.
The era of Queen Victoria was known as the “Golden Victorian Era”. It was a renaissance of industrial, political and military rule that extended its rule over countries on every continent of the globe. As a constitutional monarchy, she held few political powers but her influence symbolically was enormous. The British Empire was unquestionably the most influential power in the entire world.
H.M. Queen Elizabeth II of England, 1952
It is of interest that Queen Victoria was not of the ancient British Celtic, Irish and Scottish lineages but was almost entirely of German Saxon descent. She was the daughter of Prince Edward Augustus, the Duke of Kent and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Queen Victoria was the last British monarch of the German House of Hanover, an offshoot of the ancient German House of Wettig whose counts, princes and princess ruled as Saxons, sons of the House of Isaac, and provided rulers over an 800 year period for kings of the German Saxon states of Saxony, Poland, Great Britain, Portugal, Bulgaria, and Belgium.
Yet, Queen Victoria also became the predecessor of the German Saxon House of Windsor. Of all of these Saxon rulers of the ancient Scythian Sacae Israelite peoples, only the House of Windsor in Great Britain with 26/42



Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Albert II of Belgium still reign as Israelite Saxon monarchs to these last days at the time of the end.
The Anglo-Saxons, God’s Battle Axe arrives to its Final Homeland until Redemption
Yet, even beyond monarchial rule, the prophecy of the House of Israel depicts that they would become God’s battle axe, used by the Lord of hosts to take down nations and destroy empires till the time of the end. As the Prophet Jeremiah prophesied:
The British Empire in the late 19th Century
Jeremiah 51:19-20 – “The Portion of Jacob is not like them (Babylonians), for He is the Maker of all things; and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance. The Lord of hosts is His name.
You are My battle-axe and weapons of war: For with you I will break the nation in pieces; with you I will destroy kingdoms.”
It was the Bede, the English historian, who in the 8th century wrote of the Anglo-Saxon invasions into Britain. He wrote:
27/42



Venerable Bede the Historian – “Those who came over were of the three most powerful nations of Germany – Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. From the Jutes are descended the people of Kent and the Isle of Wight, and also those in the province of the West Saxons who are to this day called Jutes, seated opposite to the Isle of Wight.
From the Saxons, that is the country which is now called Old Saxony, (modern Northern Germany and Holland) came the East Saxons, the South Saxons, is called Angeln, and which is said from that time to remain a desert to this day, between the province of the Jutes and the Saxons, are descended the East Angles, the Midland Angles , Mercians all the race of the Northumbrians, that is of those nations that swell forth of the River Humber, and the other nations of the English.” (Quoted from Everyman’s Edition cited by E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 175)
We can see this fact specifically in the Saxon heritage typified in the rise of the British Empire. It was not that the British were such special people that the God of Israel would choose to save rather than save any other people upon this planet, but that as the ancient Saxons of Germany (Teutons). They were the spoilers of the ancient peoples and empires. As Sharon Turner in the “History of the Anglo Saxons” wrote:
The Dover Castle, one of the earliest Castles built by the
11th century Norman Viking conqueror of Anglo-Saxon England, King William the Conqueror in 1066 CE
Sharon Turner – “The first great change in the Anglo Saxons appeared in the discontinuance of their piracies. They ceased to be the ferocious spoilers of the ocean and its coasts; they became land-owners, agriculturists, and industrious citizens; ...their war-leaders became territorial chiefs; and the conflicts of capricious and sanguinary robbery were exchanged for the possession and inheritance of property in its various sorts; for trade and manufactures, for useful luxuries, peaceful industry, and domestic comfort.” (Sharon Turner, “History of the Anglo Saxons” cited by E. Raymond Capt, “Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets”, 1985, Artisan Sales, pg 175)
As the Western Hordes of the Western Scythian-Israelites, the Anglo Saxons became the shaper of nations and the recipients of Roman Christianity even with its apostate and anti-Semitic roots that came with the arrival of St. Augustine of Canterbury. Even so they were touched by the Jewish Messiah and their minds were impregnated with concepts of Jewish Messianism. Out of these messianic roots would come the restoration and redemption of the whole House of Israel.
The Saxon English remained more ecclesiastical even though she through her older tribal cousins, Cymric
Welsh, learned and remained aloof and separate from the medieval Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, more than any other country on the continent of Europe. It was the influence of the Jewish Nazarene Culdee Refuges who gave the early British the messianic zeal to defend their freedoms and independence from Roman and later Roman Christian influence. For almost a thousand years they were still known as the British Culdee Church and not the British Christian Church.

The Anglo-Saxon remained in full dominion over the Isle of Britannia until the arrival of their tribal cousins the Normans from Norway who were of the lineages of the Viking Scythian Israelites who settled in the lands of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. In the year of 1066 CE, King William the Conqueror made his grand invasion and entry into England. The era of the AngloSaxon was over yet the Germanic dynasty of the Scythian –Israelites continued.

The remnants of the ancient Roman colonies became objects of ancient lore and history while eventually the Saxon laws, tribal laws and customs and institution came under Christian influence where the lost tribal consciousness of the Israelites were awakened to a Jewish messiah, though corrupted it also reawakened over the next 2000 years, their own tribal Israelite routes. Is it any wonder why the British Israelites were the first to awaken with the idea that their tribal cousins the Jews needed a homeland in which to return?
Little did the Ephraimite British understand in 1917, that their altruistic gesture by Prime Minister Arthur James Balfour with the Balfour Declaration given in letter to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild, would eventually gain international acclimation for the establishment of a Jewish State in Israel. This would eventually become the first Israelite tribal homeland in almost 1800 years. It would eventually set the stage for the return of the Ephraimites to the Shomron region of central Israel after their own homeland on the Isle of
Britannia had become Islamized in the 21st century. It will eventually lead to the complete restoration and return of the all the House of Joseph (Ephraim) and the complete 10 Tribes of Israel to their expanded native homelands. The era of Greater Israel will have officially arrived.
The Anglo-Saxons blending with Tribal Cimmerian Cousins in other Homelands
But it was not only to the Isle of Britannia that the Anglo-Saxons arrived, for they also arrived to the north and east in the regions of the Danish Islands along the Baltic Ocean. The historical King Odin, the ancestral ruler of the Swedish Empire in the northern half of the Scandinavian island was also a Scythian of Saxon origins. The Ynglinga Saga, as narrated by Snorre, claimed that on the arrival of King Odin, he stated that he came from the region of Asaland or Asaheim in Central Scythia and in the region at Asgard, where modern city of Kiev was located.
It was in the 3rd to 4th century that Odin assembled a large army and moved northwards up the Dnieper River to the Baltic region known as Pelagus Scythicum before crossing the waters into Scandinavia. It was the army of Odin, called the “Svear” that gave Sweden her name, “Sverige”, the land of the Svear.” So who was Odin, the progenitor imperialist who began the country of Sweden?

According to the Herald’s College in London, there was found an ancient manuscript on the genealogies of the ancient Saxons from Adam and King David. Within these genealogies, Odin was listed along with his wife, Frea, along with the Ancient Royal House of Britain to King David through Hannah (Anna) the cousins of Princess Miriam the mother of the Jewish messiah Yahshua. They eventually traced down these lineages through the centuries to the English Tudors, Stuarts, Plantagenets, the German Hanoverians, Saxe-Coburgs and finally the Danes of Denmark.
Part of the geo-political tension was the encroachment of the
forces of Rome in the 2nd and 1st century BCE into Gaul. The migrating tribes that were pushed to the north were the Scythians and the Scythian Neuri tribes whose tribal life included the Seventh-day Shabbat worship and eventually settling at Arsareth.

The Cimmerii or Cymry came into Britain from the area of the Black Sea after traveling toward the northwest and through the Low Countries, then across the North Sea (Rutherford, 25). Paul B. du Chaillu gives us this interesting statement: “A careful perusal of the Eddas and Sagas will enable us, with the help of ancient Greek and Latin writers, and without any serious break in the chain of events, to make out a fairly continuous history which throws considerable light on the progenitors of the English-speaking people, their migrations northward from their old home on the shores of the Black Sea . . .” (du Chaillu, 6).
Rutherford says the Cimmerians, that is the Welsh or Cymry, were descendants of the tribe of Simeon, known to the Romans as the Simeni, the Latin form for Simeonites (Rutherford, 28).
As such, there is a subterranean knowledge by the ancient tribal members of the Lost Israelites on who they are and who they are not. What we do know is that they came from one ancestral grandfather, the Patriarch Jacob, but did have five ancestral grandmothers, Leah, and Bilhah, Rachel and Zilpah and including the wife of Joseph, Asenath, who gave birth to his two sons; Manasseh and Ephraim. Here within thirteen tribes, twelve that will have tribal inheritance and Levi as the temple priesthood, we have a strong and variable genetic pool that has created a wide divergence of genetic differences between the various tribes.
It is recognized by some that the pre-Christian civilizations that settled in the northern regions of Gaul, in central and eastern Britain, and Ireland, all were part of the Skolotic Cimmerians that moved from the region of Ukraine near the Black Sea and their former habitation at Sarmatia after they had made contact with western Asiatic (northern route) or the Grecian civilizations (southern route). These Skolotic settlements in the Isle of Britannia were inhabited as early as 290 BC and continued to arrive and settle for the next two centuries.

The Romans were quite alarmed and increasingly intolerant to the giant flux and mixture of what appeared to be multiple and various Asiatic tribes moving continuously across from steppes and plains of Eurasia via the Black Sea. What was even more concerning what how militarily strong they were with such a vibrant culture, large procreation of children and so adaptable to cultural change. The Romans had no concept that here was one tribal family with thirteen genetic strains. As the Romans became more agitated and controlling, the Scythian Israelites shifted the density of their populations farther to the north along the Black and Baltic Seas.

One of these tribes does give us considerable interest for they were the Neuri Israelite Scythians who kept their historical traditions of traveling a year and a half to reach Sarmatia, whom they called Arsareth. They are of particular interest because their religious year began in March, the tradition month of Passover that the ancient Israelites celebrated in the month of Nissan. They worshipped on the Seventh-day Saturday Sabbath like their cousins the Jew worship to this day on the Shabbat. There is considerable documentation of the large crossover root words between the languages of the Cymric Welsh, and the Old Laps, Finns, and Estonians with the Hebrew language; two hundred words in the Lapp language alone. As late as the 1700s, there were records of Finnish and Lapp traditions of their ancestors being carried away into exile by an ancient king called Shalmaneser.
When it comes to the Isles of the West, we have Britain, Ireland and Scotland. They were a formidable, brave and valiant people. According to tradition and verified by history, the Island of Ireland “remained outside the pale of the ancient Roman world” but so also did the Welsh in the western sectors of Britannia, as BibleSearchers has ably documented in Cornwall, Glastonbury and the Isle of Avalon, plus the Silurian tribal lands to the west, where the Roman legions never penetrated. There were still in these regions pockets of
civilization that have remained untouched by Roman or modern civilization up to the 16th and 17th centuries. What was known is that four centuries of Roman occupation, there was no permanent change in the racial stock in Great Britain. The Brits with few exceptions did not intermarry with their Roman overlords.
It is the Irish legends that have many great mysteries, for here is the land where there is a vast reservoir of national folk-takes and legends that gives every historical scholar fits. The Celtic tales and legends took on a mythical persona that has defied most outsider interpretations. Most give up and decry any legitimate historical context, but that is why myths is so deceptive, for out of the mist of the past can come a new reality that only those in tune with the culture will be able to understand and interpret. Such is the vibrancy of the Celtic culture and more so since we now know that it is steeped in the mysterious apocalyptic imagery of the prophets of Daniel and John the Revelator. Even without its apocalyptic mysteries, it has given modern Nintendo culture many of its most favorite games and great profits, such as “The Legend of Zelda”.
According to Ptolemy, there were over sixteen ancient peoples who lived on this ancient Island of Ireland. The Milesian tribes were a great example, for they were a warrior culture, closely akin by history with the Jewish people. They were also reputed to be of Scythian descent. Today, we now know them to be Lost

Israelites who including Jews who fled in the catastrophic era within the mists of history who in this case were reengaged back into Jewish life and culture.
According to Irish genealogical documentation of good repute, a Scythian warrior patriarch called Milesius lived for awhile in the land of Egypt as a mercenary general for hire for protective security services for the reigning Pharaoh in Egypt. In the year of 586 BCE, during the final collapse of the Southern Nation of Judah, the destruction of Jerusalem and the beautiful and sacred Temple of Solomon, the last king of Israel was transported blind to Babylon after his sons were killed in front of his eyes, 150 years after the deportation and exile of the Northern Israelites.

Unknown to the Babylonians, the genetic lineage of the House of David and the inheritance of the royal throne could still be carried by the young Princesses of the last King Zedekiah and transferred to another Prince of David. They were put in the custody of what appeared to be the politically pro-Babylonian prophet, the Prophet Jeremiah. He was given into his custody the young princess of Judah for her safekeeping, possibly unknown that he also was their great grandfather.
The Sovereign Hand of the Lord had His hand in the mixing and the selecting of the nations that would be called His own at the time of the end. Are we not surprised that Prince Milesius has now been discovered to be a descendant of the House of Judah whose ancestral lineage was traced outside the dominate Jewish tribe of Judah.
You see, the ancestral grandfather of the Jewish people and King David was the son of Judah ben Israel, whose name was Pharez ben Judah. When the Prophet Jeremiah and the Jewish princess in his custody were taken hostage to Egypt, would it be divine fate or providence that the last princess, Tamar Tephi, of the reigning dynastic family of Kings David and Solomon, would meet and marry a Scythian prince, Heremon, who was the son of Prince Milesius, of the House of Terez ben Judah, the twin brother to Pharez ben Judah, the ancestral forefathers of the Jewish people, who was born to Patriarch Judah and Tamar.
The hand of salvation of the Lord of hosts would literally preserve the Royal House of King David and Solomon through King Zedekiah. The Torah approved transfer of the royal blessing by dynastic succession of the royal inheritance by a princess with no sibling brothers as heirs if she married someone of her tribe (Judah) and her dynastic house, Kings David and Solomon. The descendants of this royal Irish lineage between King Heremon of the House of Terez ben Judah and Princess Tamar Tephi of the royal Solomonic lineage of King David and the ancient House of Pharez ben Judah still sits upon the Throne of England with Queen Elizabeth II of the current royal House of Windsor. Such are the strange fates that the God of Israel has given to us today. What we think is real may not be, and hidden in the divine matrix may arise a new reality.

The Final Resting Place – an Interlude before Redemption and Restoration
The road of “wandering” through the wilderness of EuroAsia as a trek of almost eight centuries was almost over. The first to leave were Israelites who scattered to the four corners of the earth during the great catastrophes and apocalyptic plagues just prior to the Great Exodus under the leadership of Moses. According to rabbinic traditions only a small fragment of the Israeli population went with Moses and many scattered to the western regions as far as the Isles on the Western Sea of the Atlantic Ocean.

The second to leave were parts of the tribe of Dan who were participants with the Greater Israeli Empire of Kings David and Solomon in alliance with their Phoenicians junior partner, King Hiram of Tyre. The Danites and Simeonites became maritime tribal allies later with the ancient Phoenicians and traveled the globe after those days. The historical evidence that they were the ruling party in the tin and lead mining interests on the coastline of Cornwall gives greater testimony when we realize that later the Prince of David, Joseph of Arimathea, made his fortune in this same place. Yet, here also was the uncle and guardian of the young Prince of David, Yahshua ben Yosef who became the Jewish Messiah Yahshua HaNotzri (Jesus the Nazarene). It is believed that the ancient Danites and Simeonites mined the lead and tin lodes, part of which was used in the construction of the Temple of Solomon and became a source for strategic metals used for the military weaponry of the Late Bronze Age United Kingdom of Israel.
At the time of the arrival of the Assyrian and Babylonian kings, a third portion of the Danites and Simeonites left their cousins and went on alone to find greener pastures. Here they eventually participated in the fall of invincible Citadel of the Trojans near the Bosphorus Straits. The remnants of the Trojan forces scattered from Britain to Italy, where Brutus in Great Britain and the great House of Julius Caesar traced their ancestral descent from the royalty of the House of Troy.
These three migrations of the Lost Tribes of Israel may have founded the villages and communities known today as the Hallstatt and La Tene Cultures in central Europe. The House of Dan with their migratory lust for wandering and exploring left their trademark name all along the Euro-Asian landscape, naming one river after another, the Don, the Dnieper, the Dniester, and the Danube Rivers and later the homeland of Denmark in their name. It formed a land guide or a road map for their tribal cousins to follow later.
Finally the last to leave were two waves of migrations, the first being the Cimmerian Israelites who migrated across the Bosphorus Straits near the ancient Citadel of Troy. They continued to migrate across Galatia and the Isles of the Grecian city states beneath the Black Sea in the southern course of passage to Europe. Here they traversed along the Danube River into central Europe and to those desolate regions of Europe that gave them green pastures and great flowing rivers and streams.
33/42



The last to leave were the Scythian-Israelites as they traveled north through the Georgian region between the Black and the Caspian Seas wandering up and through the Caucasus, north of the Black Sea to Sarmatia and then up the Danube River into Europe proper. The Cimmerian Israelite as a warring tribal nation consistently fought and destroyed the ascending Roman legions until the days of Imperial Rome had arrived. Yet, it would be the Scythian Israelites that would later fragment into the Ostrogoths (Eastern Goths) and the Visigoths (Western Goths), who sequentially would sack and eventually destroy the Imperial City of Rome.
Soon all of the Lost Tribes of Israel would have settled into their new homes. Most of them would find their final resting places within the lands of the European continent. These homes can be seen in part in the following chart and there they would remain until the Messiah would call for them to return to their own tribal homeland from whence they left twenty eight centuries earlier.

The Final Redemption and Restoration of the House of Israel and Judah
During these years, each of these tribes had been introduced to the Jewish Messiah, Yahshua HaNotzri (Jesus the Messiah). They were given first the pristine truth of rabbinic Judaism as interpreted by Hillel the Great. This was then put into a divine mission with the sole purpose of finding and laying the pathway for the redemption of the Lost Tribes of Israel through the teachings of the Jewish Rabbi Yahshua ben Yosef (Rabbi Jesus the son of Joseph). It was He, who was manifested as the Divine Emanation of YHVH’s Messiah. It was He who would instill the pathway of Torah enlightenment for all generations.
The Lost Tribes were later introduced to the corrupted view of “The Jewish Nazarene” first by the Apostate
Gnostic Roman Christian Church in the 4th century CE. They became the participants of the great apostasy of the Christian faith as Torah commands given to the Children of Israel on the mount called Sinai were stripped of their Hebrew philosophical roots and placed upon the Hellenistic Greco-Roman roots. It was they who would become one of the greatest adversaries of the Jewish people for the next two millenniums.
Finally, it was the Lost Tribes of Israel who were introduced to the 17th century corruption of Jewish Messianism and Mysticism by the Kabbalist Rabbi, turned Anti-Torah Sabbatian, Shabbatai Tzevi. They later became the followers, as British and Scottish Freemasons of the century later coalition between Islamic Dolmeh Qabala trained Jewish Rabbi Jacob Frank, the Jewish Jesuit founder of the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, and the Jewish founder of the European Banking Economic Order, Mayer Amschel Rothschild.
In spite of the theological corruptions, the European based former Scythians, Cimmerian-Gauls, AngloSaxon Israelites with many other “hidden identities”, would someday reemerge with their new identity as the prophetic House of Ephraim or more specifically, the House of Joseph. They will be prophetically drawn back into imperial Messianic One World Order with their tribal cousins, the Jewish people, under the rule of the future Messiah of the House of King David.
35/42



It has been a long journey for the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel but that journey is about over. In arrogance Israel apostasized against the God of Israel and wanted to be self-fulfilled and independent. In spite of tribal rivalries and jealousies, they rejected the literal word of the Almighty One of Israel that their covenant was to keep all the commands of the Torah, and worship together with their entire family of Israel at the temple in Jerusalem. They turned their backs against Judah because of the oppression of the last days of Solomon and the oppressive arrogance his son, King Rehoboam. They rejected the divine “word of the Lord” and refused to worship in the Holy Temple and ally themselves with Judah as the Mechoqeck, the Lawgiver of the Almighty One on this planet earth. The unity of Israel was fragmented and soon both houses of Israel were in exile.
The Ancestral Home of Tamar Tephi, the daughter of King Zedekiah and her husband the Scythian Judahite Heremon ben Milesius
As the combined synthesis of all the prophets of Israel , the day of redemption and reconciliation will bring all of the United House of Israel to the Day of the Messiah. Judah will become officially as she never had left, as the guardian spokesman, the “Guardian of the Oracles of God” and the Lawgiver of the Torah as the Age of the Messiah will bring this planet earth into an era of Torah enlightenment.
Genesis 49:10 – “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver (Judah as Mechoqeck) from between His feet, until Shiloh (Messiah) comes; and to Him (Messiah) shall be the obedience of the people.”
In those days, the Messiah son of David (Maschiach ben David) will take the scepter and begin His righteous rule, as one of the House of Judah and a Prince of the House of King David.
Isaiah 9:6-7 – “For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace, there will be no end, upon the throne of David and over His Kingdom, to order and to establish it with judgment and justice from that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”
In those days also those that were “overcomers” will be changed in the “twinkling of the eye” as we are cloaked with “eternity”.

I Corinthians 15:51-53 – “Behold, I tell you a mystery; We shall not all sleep (die) , but we shall all be changed – in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality...and...“Death is swallowed up in victory.”
This may sound inconceivable and strange but the destiny of those who follow the Messiah will to become like Him
I John 3:2 – “Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He (Messiah) is revealed , we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He is (in His divinity). And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
The Mound of Hostages – Megalithic Burial Tomb with Three Compartments divided by Sillstones with Cremated Remains
As Yahshua HaNotzri (Jesus the Nazarene) was manifested in the flesh as the Messiah of YHVH God, so also those who overcome, as Jews of the Tribe of Judah who were natural branches of the vine (de-vine), who were broken off and have been restored, the Lost Tribes of Israel who were re-grafted back into the vine (devine), and the Gentiles of the world that were grafted through Jesus the Messiah (Yahshua HaMaschiach).
Is the combined testimony of the prophets in conformity with the revealed truth about redemption and restoration? Let us look at the prophetic testimony of Yahshua as given through the Revelation of Jesus the Messiah:
Revelation 20:4-7 – “And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Yahshua (Jesus) and for the word of God, who had not worshipped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Messiah for a thousand years...Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Messiah, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.
Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle,
37/42



whose number is as the sand of the sea.”
Have we ever wondered who are those who “sat on the thrones” and “judgment was committed to them”? Who were they ruling over? Who were they judging? For those who believe that the whole earth will be annihilated at the coming of the Messiah may need to reconsider. The forces of evil with the Anti-Messiah at Armageddon will be destroyed. That will be a historical fact. But the testimony of the prophets suggests that a literal earth and a literal kingdom will remain on this planet earth for the next thousand years. The governance of this planet with be given to the remnant of the Jews who have remained in covenant with the God of Israel and all of us that are genetically or culturally identified with the Lost Sheep of the House of Israel. We all will be changed by the resurrection of the Jewish Messiah Yahshua, will be glorified with His divinity and will “reign with the Messiah” for a thousand years.
What is little recognized is that almost everyone on this planet earth has ancestral genes by a Jew or an Israelite of the Lost Tribes of the House of Israel . That is why the God of Israel cast them out of their homelands into the nations of the world, so that He could imbed their genetic imprint into each one of us. By our identity through Jewish Messiah and the genetic imprint to return to the Family of God, every person on this planet has the privilege to share an inheritance in the “world to come”. Yet, the apocalyptic prophet, Isaiah, gives to us new dimensions of how to understand what will happen at the glorious entry of our new existence at the beginning of the thousand year era called “The Great Day of the Lord”.
Isaiah 66:15-19 (parts) - “For behold , the Lord will come with fire and with His chariots, like a whirlwind, to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by His sword the Lord will judge all flesh; and the slain of the Lord shall by many...It shall be that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come (to Armageddon) and see My glory. I will set a sign among them; and those among them who escape I will send to the nations... who have not heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the Gentiles...”
The New Moon rising over the Hill of Tara, the ancestral home of Tamar Tephi that last Israeli Princess of King David of the dynastic House of King Zedekiah. On this site was the Crowning Site of the High Kings of Ireland
Let us read this carefully. The glory of the Lord will be revealed to those with “eyes that can see” and “ears that can hear”. It will be their divine mission to return to the Gentile nations of the world who have not heard about the fame of the God of Israel and were not privileged to witness the glory of the Almighty One when He comes with fire and fury.
Do we really expect that CNN camera crews will be “left behind” to record the entire annihilation of the forces of Satan and the anti-Messiah’s world coalition camped in the plains of Megiddo as they arrive to battle an inter-galactic invasion of “aliens” to this planet earth. What a surprise it will be to behold as the globalists, the imperialists, and the internationalists will be there to battle against the coming interplanetary forces of the

Messiah ben David (Messiah the son of David).
Let us ponder these profound concepts for a minute. Who actually will be coming on His chariots of fire? The Messiah of YHWH God, who is actually YHVH God in his manifested state as a physical being for that is the only way He can be revealed in our three dimensional reality.
The next phase of Isaiah’s prophetic revealing is about the entry into the New Era of the Messianic Kingdom of the Messiah. There will be a major readjustment of the populations of the world. If the Satanic prophecies about how Lucifer envisions this planet at the end of this era are correct, then the BibleSearcher’s investigation into the messages in 12 languages engraved upon the “American Stonehenge” as revealed in the article titled, “The Georgia Guidestones and the Manifesto to Eliminate 6.0 Billion People from this Planet Earth” will carry a new living reality. As prophesied about the new world age without a spiritual mandate and the True Messiah, we read:
Georgian Guidestone – “The Message of the Georgia Guidestones”
1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. 2. Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity. 3. Unite humanity with a living new language. 4. Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason. 5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. 6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. 7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials. 8. Balance personal rights with social duties. 9. Prize truth - beauty - love - seeking harmony with the infinite. 10. Be not a cancer on the earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature.
The House of Judah and the House of Israel will be reestablished in the lands surrounding Zion. The Temple of Ezekiel will be built as prophetically revealed. The Land of Israel will become the governing region of the whole earth. The world will not be annihilated but will be restored and renewed. This will not be the New Heaven and the New Earth, for they will still be set into the distant future, as revealed:
Isaiah 66:15-19 (parts) – “Then they shall bring all your brethren (Judah and the Lost Tribes of Israel) for an offering to the Lord out of all nations, to my holy mountain Jerusalem’ says the Lord, ‘as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord. And I will also take some of them for priests and Levites,’ says the Lord.
“For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I will make (future 1000 years beyond the coming of the Messiah) shall remain before Me (future in the eyes of God),’ says the Lord, ‘So shall your descendants and your name remain (into the future).
And it shall come to pass that from one New Moon to another, (times and seasons of the Torah are still in effect) and from one Sabbath to another (Torah worship of the Seventh-day Shabbats and the Festival Sabbaths), all flesh shall come to worship before Me,’ says the Lord.
39/42



And they shall go forth and look upon the corpses of the men who have transgressed against me. For their worm does not die, and their fire is not quenched. They shall be an abhorrence to all flesh (this act of “abhorrence” will not occur in the New Earth).”
As the House of Israel was cast out for her defiance in rejecting all the literal applications of the Torah commands at Sinai, and sent wandering “lost” throughout the nations of the world, so also the House of Judah will become divided. The oracles of God that was given to Judah as the Mechoqeck (“Lawgiver”) to preserve in their custody has truly been preserved but a “falling out” did occur within the House of Judah.
A large portion of the House of Judah voluntarily disappeared into the Christian and Islamic faiths. There they would desecrate the holiness of the Torah. They would claim that the Messiah had already come and that in the “days of the Messiah” everything the Torah commanded that they were to do, they would no longer have to obey. Confusion would reign in Judaism, for the enemies of the Holy Ones of Judah would not come from without but from within. The dark forces of HaSatan (Satan) would seek to destroy the House of Judah from within and the catastrophic toll upon the Jewish people has been immense.

Message from BibleSearchers
BibleSearchers scans the world for information that has relevance on the time of the end. It is our prayer that this will allow the believers in the Almighty One of Israel to “watch and be ready”. Our readiness has nothing to do trying to halt the progression of evil on our planet earth. In our readiness, we seek to be prepared for the coming of the Messiah of Israel so that goodness and evil will be manifested in its fullest. Our preparation is a pathway of spiritual readiness for a world of peace. Our defender is the Lord of hosts. The time of the end suggests that the Eternal One of Israel’s intent is to close out this chapter of earth’s history so that the perpetrators of evil, those that seek power, greed and control, will be eliminated from this planet earth. The wars of the heavens are being played out on this planet earth and humans will live through it to testify of the might, power, justice and the love of the God of Israel. In a world of corruption and disinformation, we cannot always know what the historical truth is and who is promoting evil or mis-information. We cannot guarantee our sources but we will always seek to portray trends that can be validated in the Torah and the testimony of the prophets of the Old and the New Testament.
