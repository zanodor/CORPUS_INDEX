The Hungarians: The Most Ancient People of Europe
MAGYAR DEMOKRATA
2008: issue nr. 35.

•••••••
Michelangelo Naddeo, Italian researcher, believes that the first
civilization in Europe had already appeared in the Neolithic and it
belonged to the ancient people living in the Carpathian Basin, the
Hungarians.
In spite of the fact that you are Italian, you have been studying
Hungarian history for decades now. What led you to undertake
research on one of the least known countries of Europe?
Although I was born in Italy, I have had doubts since my childhood that all my
ancestors were of Italian origin, and that is because of my unusual family name and
my features. This is why I decided to try to get to know as many cultures and
populations as possible in my life, so that I could understand who really were the
ancestors of the Europeans and where I came from. This explains why I started to get
interested in Antiquity. I have always been into archaeology and history and I have
been always interested in the history of Bronze Age Europe. I always thought that the
continent was not uninhabited before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans and, as I
elaborated on this thought, after some time I was faced to ancient Pannonia and its
inhabitants.
The Indo-Europeanists will probably be shocked even by the thought of their common
history having been called into question. What led you to this theory, which is very likely to
astound the people of our country? In fact, in your next book, which is about to appear, you
state nothing less than that we are the most ancient inhabitants of Europe...
Sacred Tradition versus The Reign of Quantity

In the book “Honfoglalás... the Magyars are back home”, I listed some
50 cultural markers which migrated from Central Europe to Central
Asia and came back with the Hungarians at the time of the
Honfoglalás.1 I have taken two of those cultural markers (art and
religion) and I have further researched them through the study of
archaeological artefacts.
I have collected thousands of pictures
of archaeological artefacts, which
prove that a number of pre-Indo
European designs and sacred
symbols originated in and around the
Carpathian Basin (Gold Idol
Civilization, Calcholithic and Bronze
age), spread to Agglutinia (Early
bronze age) survived in Pannonia (Mid bronze age), and spread again to Magna
Pannonia (late Bronze Age).
Those same designs and sacred symbols also
migrated to Pazyryk, Altai, at the beginning of the
first millennium BC. Later on, they moved to the
Tarim Basin, and finally come back to the
Carpathian Basin at the time of the Honfoglalás. In
other words, the archaeological Bronze Age artefacts
found in the Carpathian Basin are identical or very
similar to those found in the Tarim Basin by Marc
Aurel Stein and to those excavated in the Carpathian Basin and dated to the time of
the Honfoglalás. Furthermore, I myself have taken in Hungary and elsewhere dozens
of photos of symbols and designs which were bronze age sacred symbols and which,
even having lost their ancient sacred meaning, are still to-day used in the decoration
of modern buildings.
Thus, are these symbolic motifs and designs still present in our art?
The same Szent Korona2 contains 18 (eighteen) “pagan” symbols which can be traced
from Bronze Age Pannonia, to the Tarim Basin and back to Hungary of the
Honfoglalás time.
The Hungarians came back to the Carpathian Basin, at the time of the Honfoglalás,
with the same symbolic art and with the same Mother Goddess, that they had
represented in Europe, in the Bronze Age as a woman in the delivery position, while
giving birth.
The famous so-called “tulips”, which appear elsewhere in Hungary, are the evolution
of a Bronze Age design, which was the symbolic representation of the pregnant
Isten3 Goddess. The Etruscans depicted “tulips” far before the tulips started being
imported in Europe. Analogously, the Etruscan and Armorican (Anjou)
representations of the Mother Goddess, when the memory of their sacredness was
lost, became lily flowers.
Still today, the Hungarians, the Ainu, the descendants of the Etruscans, and most
populations of Central Asia unknowingly use the same representation of the Mother
Goddess as a decorative motif.
The cultural DNA of the Hungarians kept unchanged along 5 millennia.
1. This event is also called the Second Entry of the Hungarians into their homeland in the heart of the Carpathian
Basin. The First Entry (the conquest) is considered to be when the Huns conquered this area in the 5th
century. The Second Entry (hence reconquest) is the entry of the Magyars of Árpád in the end of the 9th
century. However, there is serious debate about whether it really was a “conquest”, that is, a military taking-by
force of this territory, since there is solid evidence – archaeological, linguistic and cultural – proving that the
people who lived here at the time even of the “First Conquest” were kin to the Huns. In actual fact, there is
comprehensive and strong evidence for the claim that the Magyars are autochthonous to Central Europe, and

in particular to the Carpathian Basin. Italian linguist Angela Marcantonio says for example of the Finns and
their origin: “we know from archaeology that there have been no migrations from the east, and that the coasts
of the Baltic Sea have been inhabited without interruption for the last 10.000 years. We also know from
genetics and palaeo-anthropology that the Finns are basically ‘europoid’ peoples, coming from central Europe,
possibly from the ‘Ukraina refugium’, together with the other European populations, according to Wiik
(2002). See: Historic Linguistics and the Origin of the Finns . [ ]
