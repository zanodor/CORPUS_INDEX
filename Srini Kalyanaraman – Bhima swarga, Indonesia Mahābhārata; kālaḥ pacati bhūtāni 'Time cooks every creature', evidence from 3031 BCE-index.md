Vaishampayana said: "Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world. He addressed Arjuna, saying, ‘O thou of great intelligence, it is Time that cooks every creature (in his cauldron). I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee also to see it.’
Section D. Bhima swarga sculptural rendering in Candi Sukuh
The metaphor of 'Time cooking every creature in his cauldron', is rendered in sculpture in Candisukuh, Indonesia which depicts Bhima as a blacksmith forging a kris sword, Arjuna blowing the bellows and Ganesa with a dance step.
The scene in bas relief The scene depicted Bhima as the blacksmith in the left forging the metal, Ganesha in the center, and Arjuna in the right operating the tube blower to pump air into the furnace.

"Thus addressed by his brother, the son of Kunti only repeated the word ‘Time, Time!’ and fully endorsed the view of his eldest brother gifted with great intelligence. Ascertaining the resolution of Arjuna, Bhimasena and the twins fully endorsed the words that Arjuna had said. Resolved to retire from the world for earning merit, they brought Yuyutsu before them. Yudhishthira made over the kingdom to the son of his uncle by his Vaisya wife. Installing Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the eldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed Subhadra, saying, ‘This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus. The survivor of the Yadus, Vajra, has been made a king. Parikshit will rule in Hastinapura, while the Yadava prince, Vajra, will rule in Shakraprastha. He should be protected by thee. Never set thy heart on unrighteousness.’
"Having said these words, king Yudhishthira the just, along with his brothers, promptly offered oblations of water unto Vasudeva of great intelligence, as also unto his old maternal uncle and Rama and others. He then duly performed the Sraddhas of all those deceased kinsmen of his. The king, in honour of Hari and naming him repeatedly, fed the Island-born Vyasa, and Narada, and Markandeya possessed of wealth of penances, and Yajnavalkya of Bharadwaja’s race, with many delicious viands. In honour of Krishna, he also gave away many jewels and gems, and robes and clothes, and villages, and horses and cars, and female slaves by hundreds and thousands unto foremost of Brahmanas. Summoning the citizens. Kripa was installed as the preceptor and Parikshit was made over to him as his disciple, O chief of Bharata’s race.
...
Vaishampayana continued: "Then Dharma, and Shakra, and the Maruts, and the Ashvinis, and other deities, and the celestial Rishis, causing Yudhishthira to ascend on a car, proceeded to Heaven. Those beings crowned with success and capable of going everywhere at will, rode their respective cars. King Yudhishthira, that perpetuator of Kuru’s race, riding on that car, ascended quickly, causing the entire welkin to blaze with his effulgence. Then Narada, that foremost of all speakers, endued with penances, and conversant with all the worlds, from amidst that concourse of deities, said these words: ‘All those royal sages that are here have their achievements transcended by those of Yudhishthira. Covering all the worlds by his fame and splendour and by his wealth of conduct, he has attained to Heaven in his own (human) body. None else than the son of Pandu has been heard to achieve this.’
"Hearing these words of Narada, the righteous-souled king, saluting the deities and all the royal sages there present, said, ‘Happy or miserable, whatever the region be that is now my brothers’, I desire to proceed to. I do not wish to go anywhere else.’
"Hearing this speech of the king, the chief of the deities, Purandara, said these words fraught with noble sense: ‘Do thou live in this place, O king of kings, which thou hast won by thy meritorious deeds. Why dost thou still cherish human affections? Thou hast attained to great success, the like of which no other man has ever been able to attain. Thy brothers, O delighter of the Kurus, have succeeded in winning regions of felicity. Human affections still touch thee. This is Heaven. Behold these celestial Rishis and Siddhas who have attained to the region of the gods.’
"Gifted with great intelligence, Yudhishthira answered the chief of the deities once more, saying, ‘O conqueror of Daityas, I venture not to dwell anywhere separated from them. I desire to go there, where my brothers have gone. I wish to go there where that foremost of



6
women, Draupadi, of ample proportions and darkish complexion and endued with great intelligence and righteous of conduct, has gone.’"

Section C. Gāndhāri’s curse
"Gāndhāri said, ‘The Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, O Krishna, have both been burnt. Whilst they were thus being exterminated, O Janardana, why wert thou indifferent to them? Thou wert competent to prevent the slaughter, for thou hast a large number of followers and a vast force. Thou hadst eloquence, and thou hadst the power (for bringing about peace). Since deliberately, O slayer of Madhu, thou wert indifferent to this universal carnage, therefore, O mighty-armed one, thou shouldst reap the fruit of this act. By the little merit I have acquired through waiting dutifully on my husband, by that merit so difficult to attain, I shall curse thee, O wielder of the discus and the mace! Since thou wert indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other, therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen! In the thirty-sixth year from this, O slayer of Madhu, thou shalt, after causing the slaughter of thy kinsmen and friends and sons, perish by disgusting means in the wilderness. The ladies of thy race, deprived of sons, kinsmen, and friends, shall weep and cry even as these ladies of the Bharata race!’"
Vaishampayana continued, "Hearing these words, the high-souled Vasudeva, addressing the venerable Gāndhāri, said unto her these words, with a faint smile, ‘There is none in the world, save myself, that is capable of exterminating the Vrishnis. I know this well. I am endeavouring to bring it about. In uttering this curse, O thou of excellent vows, thou hast



7
aided me in the accomplishment of that task. The Vrishnis are incapable of being slain by others, be they human beings or gods or Danavas. The Yadavas, therefore shall fall by one another’s hand.’ After he of Dasharha’s race had said these words, the Pandavas became stupefied. Filled with anxiety all of them became hopeless of life!’" (Stri-vilapa-parva; Section 25).The Mahabharata, Book 11: Stri Parva: Stri-vilapa-parva: Section 25 (sacredtexts.com)
Mausala parva describes the event 35 years after the Kurukshetra war has ended. These events are anticipated and explained by sages to Krishna's son Samba, who dressed as a woman mocks the Rishis.
Mausala Parva describes the fulfillment of the curse 36 years after the end of the great war. The empire is peaceful and prosperous, the youth of Yadavas have become frivolous and hedonistic. Samba dresses up as a woman and his friends meet Rishi Vishwamitra, Durvasa, Vashista, Narada and other rishis, who were visiting Dwaraka for an audience with Krishna. The young man playfully pretending to be a woman claims he is pregnant and asks the rishis to predict the gender of the baby. One Rishi sees through the prank. In a fit of rage, he curses Samba will give birth to an iron bolt (Gada (mace) a weapon) that will destroy his entire race. As per the curse, Samba next day delivered an iron rod. The youth inform King Ugrasena what has happened, who asks Samba to powder the iron bolt and cast it into the Prabhas sea. Later this powder grew up on the seashore in the form of eraká grass. After some time a fight with iron clubs made of eraká grass broke out between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other, thus ending up the whole of the clan. A piece of the same iron bolt dropped down in the sea and swallowed by a fish which was caught by a hunter named Jara. He took out the iron piece and applied it on the tip of his arrow. The hunter Jara mistook Krishna's partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, wounding him mortally resulting departure of Krishna from the earth.

Mausala Parva - Wikipedia
Vaishampayana said: "When the thirty-sixth year (after the battle) was reached, the delighter of the Kurus, Yudhishthira, beheld many unusual portents. Winds, dry and strong, and showering gravels, blew from every side. Birds began to wheel, making circles from right to left. The great rivers ran in opposite directions. The horizon on every side seemed to be always covered with fog. Meteors, showering (blazing) coals, fell on the Earth from the sky. The Sun’s disc, O king, seemed to be always covered with dust. At its rise, the great luminary of day was shorn of splendour and seemed to be crossed by headless trunks (of human beings). Fierce circles of light were seen every day around both the Sun and the Moon. These circles showed three hues. Their edges seemed to be black and rough and ashy-red in colour. These and many other omens, foreshadowing fear and danger, were seen, O king, and filled the hearts of men with anxiety. A little while after, the Kuru king Yudhishthira heard of the wholesale carnage of the Vrishnis in consequence of the iron bolt. The son of Pandu, hearing that only Vasudeva and Rama had escaped with life, summoned his brothers and took counsel with them as to what they should do. Meeting with one another, they became greatly distressed upon hearing that the Vrishnis had met with destruction through the Brahmana’s rod of chastisement. The death of Vasudeva, like the drying up of the ocean, those heroes could not believe. In fact the destruction of the wielder of Saranga was incredible to them. Informed of the incident about the iron bolt, the Pandavas became filled with grief and sorrow. In fact, they sat down, utterly cheerless and penetrated with blank despair."
Janamejaya said: "Indeed, O holy one, how was it that the Andhakas along with Vrishnis, and those great car-warriors, the Bhojas, met with destruction in the very sight of Vasudeva?"
Vaishampayana continued: "When the thirty-sixth year was reached (after the great battle) a great calamity overtook the Vrishnis. Impelled by Time, they all met with destruction in consequence of the iron bolt."
Janamejaya said: "Cursed by whom did those heroes, the Vrishnis, the Andhakas, and the Bhojas, met with destruction? O foremost regenerate persons, do thou tell me this in detail. (Mausala parva, Section 1)
...
"Proceeding then to the forest, Keshava beheld Rama sitting in a solitary spot thereof. He also saw that Rama had set himself to Yoga and that from out his mouth was issuing a mighty snake. The colour of that snake was white. Leaving the human body (in which he had dwelt so long), that high-souled naga of a 1,000 heads and having a form as large as that of a



9
mountain, endued besides with red eyes, proceeded along that way which led to the ocean. Ocean himself, and many celestial snakes, and many sacred Rivers were there, for receiving him with honour. There were Karkotaka and Vasuki and Takshaka and Prithusravas and Varuna and Kunjara, and Misri and Sankha and Kumuda and Pundarika, and the high-souled Dhritarashtra, and Hrada and Kratha and Sitikantha of fierce energy, and Chakramanda and Atishanda, and that foremost of Nagas called Durmukha, and Amvarisha, and king Varuna himself, O monarch. Advancing forward and offering him the Arghya and water to wash his feet, and with diverse other rites, they all worshipped the mighty Naga and saluted him by making the usual enquiries.
"After his brother had thus departed from the (human) world, Vasudeva of celestial vision, who was fully acquainted with the end of all things, wandered for some time in that lonely forest thoughtfully. Endued with great energy he then sat down on the bare earth. He had thought before this of everything that had been fore-shadowed by the words uttered by Gāndhāri in former days. He also recollected the words that Durvasas had spoken at the time his body was smeared by that Rishi with the remnant of the Payasa he had eaten (while a guest at Krishna’s house). The high-souled one, thinking of the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, as also of the previous slaughter of the Kurus, concluded that the hour (for his own departure from the world) had come. He then restrained his senses (in Yoga). Conversant with the truth of every topic, Vasudeva, though he was the Supreme Deity, wished to die, for dispelling all doubts and establishing a certainty of results (in the matter of human existence), simply for upholding the three worlds and for making the words of Atri’s son true. Having restrained all his senses, speech, and mind, Krishna laid himself down in high Yoga.
"A fierce hunter of the name of Jara then came there, desirous of deer. The hunter, mistaking Keshava, who was stretched on the earth in high Yoga, for a deer, pierced him at the heel with a shaft and quickly came to that spot for capturing his prey. Coming up, Jara beheld a man dressed in yellow robes, rapt in Yoga and endued with many arms. Regarding himself an offender, and filled with fear, he touched the feet of Keshava. The high-souled one comforted him and then ascended upwards, filling the entire welkin with splendour. When he reached Heaven, Vasava and the twin Ashvinis and Rudra and the Adityas and the Vasus and the Viswedevas, and Munis and Siddhas and many foremost ones among the Gandharvas, with the Apsaras, advanced to receive him. Then, O king, the illustrious Narayana of fierce energy, the Creator and Destroyer of all, that preceptor of Yoga, filling Heaven with his splendour, reached his own inconceivable region. Krishna then met the deities and (celestial) Rishis and Charanas, O king, and the foremost ones among the Gandharvas and many beautiful Apsaras and Siddhas and Saddhyas. All of them, bending in humility, worshipped him. The deities all saluted him, O monarch, and many foremost of Munis and Rishis worshipped him who was the Lord of all. The Gandharvas waited on him, hymning his praises, and Indra also joyfully praised him."(Mausala parva, Section 4)
"Vyasa said, ‘The mighty car-warriors of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races have all been consumed by the Brahmana’s curse. O chief of Kuru’s race, it behoveth thee not to grieve for their destruction. That which has happened had been ordained. It was the destiny of those high-souled warriors. Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully competent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the universe with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be said of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? He who used to proceed in front of thy car, armed with discus and mace, through affection for thee, was the four-armed Vasudeva, that ancient rishi. That high-souled one of expansive



10
eyes, Krishna, having lightened the burthen of the Earth and cast off his (human) body, has attained to his own high seat. By thee also, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O mighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O foremost one of Kuru’s race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned with success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives. The time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O puissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding and prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have not outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity comes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the universe, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at its pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes weak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that position, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy weapons, having achieved success, have gone away to the place they came from. They will, again, come into thy hands when the Time for their coming approaches. The time has come, O Bharata, for you all to attain to the highest goal. Even this is what I regard to be highly beneficial for you all, O chief of Bharata’s race."
Vaishampayana continued: "Having heard these words of Vyasa of immeasurable energy, the son of Pritha, receiving his permission, returned to the city named after the elephant. Entering it, the hero approached Yudhishthira and informed him of all that had taken place with reference to the Vrishnis."The end of Mausala-parva The Mahabharata, Book 16: Mausala Parva: Section 8 (sacred-texts.com)

Bhima, the blacksmith, Candi Sukuh and Bhima Swarga for Pandu's ātman July 26, 2017
Bhima swarga
[quote]Kertha Gosa means - “the place where the king meets with his ministries to discuss questions of justice.”
The story of Bhima Swarga is elaborate and all-embracing. Bhima Swarga in Balinese means, “Bhima goes to the abode of the gods.” Swarga literally means to any place where the gods happen to reside, Heaven or Hell.
Bhima, the second oldest of the five Pandava brothers, is forced by his mother Kunti with the mission to rescue from Hell the souls of his earthly father Pandu, and his second mother, Madri. After saving Pandu and Madri from Hell, Bhima must secure them for Heaven. Throughout Bhima’s journey to Heaven and Hell he is accompanied by his two loyal servants (the clown characters). These made up characters are highly important to the story Bhima Swarga because the ordinary Balinese can relate to the characters in the story Bhima Swarga because the characters represent ordinary Bali.
Bhima’s siblings go through hell right along with Bhima to rescue their parents. The siblings observe people being tortured for their sins. The siblings are Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadewa, Yudhishthira, and Bhima. The two clown characters whom



11
accompany Bhima on his journey to Hell are Twalen and Mredah. Twalen wears a black checkered loin cloth and is the helper to Bhima. Twalen translates what is being said by Yudhishthira and Kunti. Mredah always wears red checkered loin cloths and he also helps Bhima along with cracking a joke to lighten the mood. Bhima goes to Hell to rescue his parents and when he arrives he finds his parents are in a huge hot water bath. Bhima tips the bath which his parents were boiling in and they are taken off to Heaven. The Demons did not like Bhima rescuing his parents and allowing them to go to Heaven. Bhima then has to fight off the Demons. Next, the Gods do not like this idea of Bhima taking his parents from Hell to Heaven. Bhima then gets into a fight with the Gods and Bhima dies in Heaven. The high God of all restores Bhima back to life and gives Bhima the drink of immortality. The last scene of Bhima Swarga shows justice, even with punishments of Hell.
The ceiling of Kertha Gosa is painted in a traditional Balinese style that resembles wayang, “shadow figure”. Paintings in the wayang style are related closely to shadow theatre art, relating to the Mahabharata and Ramayana stories. Wayang style paintings have been faithfully preserved that it continues today to reflect Bali’s Hindu-Javanese heritage in its traditional iconography and content. Iconography was used a lot in Bali’s culture. Iconoclasm is used because the Balinese people wanted to represent living things through pictures and shadows; it was prohibited to represent any living entity. [unquote]

Stutterheim W.F. (1956) An Ancient Javanese Bhima Cult. In: Studies in Indonesian Archaeology. Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde. Springer, Dordrecht
Abstract
To lesser known products of the final period of ancient Javanese art belong statues of Bhima. Of these only a few are known, but others are easily recognizable as such. I hope shortly to review the principal examples of these statues, which as yet have failed to find their place in the official art history of Java, mainly because no one has known where to place them. They fitted in poorly ; they are neither gods nor the usual type of temple guards, and the existence of a special Bhima cult is unknown. Furthermore, why only Bhima and never the popular Arjuna? For this reason one would search for them in vain in the standard works on ancient Java, and were it not that Bali put me on the trail of their probable significance I would have gladly resigned myself to this situation. Now, however, I believe I am in a position to cast further light on these statues and, unless I am greatly mistaken, even to associate their worship with various traces which can be found today. To this end there follows first a cursory survey of these statues, which it was hitherto impossible to fit in, but which, as I hope to show, are in fact to be considered coherent, valuable data from Java’s past.

Yet Knebel must be read critically. In speaking of the Javanese physiognomy, he refers exclusively to the Bima of the Javanese wayang and not to the Javanese themselves. It would be more accurate to say that it is completely un-Javanese, at least certainly not mid-Javanese. He also speaks of an inscription on the back panel; this should be “on an ornamental piece in the form of a double wajra-club placed against the back panel.” The following should be noted about our reproduction. The figure has been subjected to rather extensive restoration; the polèng pattern has been accentuated by color and, in accordance with the wayang tradition of the postKartasura period, trousers have been painted on the originally bare thighs.

As is known, in the wayang, the type is primary; the person portrayed, secondary. Therefore it would be possible, if desired, to play several lakons with one set of dolls, each of one of the established types. It is true that in the expensive and overcomplete wayang sets of the courts and dalĕms a distinction is also made between the puppets, but this is not really necessary for the play. If necessary, the same puppet can be used, e.g., for Brama and Baladéwa, as is commonly done on Bali. This is even the rule in masked plays (topèng).

I suspected a connection with the Bhairawa cult of Singasari in Oud-heden van Bali, I, p. 166: “Beyond a doubt we are faced here with a Baliniese variant of the magic sanctuaries of Singasari whose kālacakra meaning was first clearly brought to light by Moens. Undoubtedly the Balinese pendant is cruder, but also more fantastic and impressive, although with the little which remains of this. glorious past we are no longer able to sense as keenly the true impression on the receptive and tender mind of the Balinese which such figures must have made in a moonlit, moving Indian night of magic festivities.” And p. 168: “However the meaning of the corpse-like figure on which the image stands is also none too clear. While we can point to similar forms in Tibet and India where they fill an important part in the conceptual world of the Buddhists, these areas are too far removed to serve as examples without modification. For that reason I prefer once more to point to the Singasari temple which apparently was associated with the initiation of members into a certain secret



32
sect. This initiation undoubtedly was again related to the lingga cult as a means of strengthening and preserving the royal authority and the power of the ruling dynasty, which in turn was closely related to productivity in the realm and prosperity in general. Here we are faced with a set of customs and ideas which will yield its secret only extremely slowly, and here, too, Bali can once more provide important material for further detailed studies.” For the kāla symbol of the mask see ibid. pp. 166 ff.

For the Bhairawa sects, see in addition to Moens, loc. cit., Goris in Oud-Javaansche en Balineesche Theologie, s.v. ; Pigeaud, Tantu Panggĕlaram, s.v. ; and most recently Goris in Mededeelingen der Kirtya Liefrinck van der Tuuk, No. 3, pp. 42 ff. The Bhairawas were pre-eminently the sect of forbidden things. It was believed that, by a ritual performance of that which was forbidden to the normal mortal or in which he was restricted, soul and matter could be divorced and the former could be absorbed into the deity, if possible during life. Ritual orgies with excessive indulgence in the five forbidden things (māngsa — meat, matsya — fish; madya alcohol; maithuna — intercourse [in the sense of promiscuity] and mudrā according to some, mystic gestures, according to others, grain) served as rites of deliverance. The symbols indicate death and horror (offering knife, skull bowls, etc.) or erotism. Furthermore, the divoree between soul and matter obtained by their observance produced supernatural powers which effected miracles (flying through the air, invulnerability, etc.) and made their sect a truly magic sect. At this point witchcraft and black magic enter; these form a popular edition of what was originally meant as ritual and worship. The native shamanism essential to ancestor worship, with its trance dances, etc., provided a welcome breeding ground for these foreign sects. Much of the demonic character of the popular religion in Bali is, in my opinion, due to this. Elsewhere I hope to trace the connection between this Balinese demon (léyak) faith and “Bhairawism” ; here I merely want to point out that in one of the léyak magic formulas, set forth by De Kat Angelino in TBG, LX (1921), the léyak praying for magic power considers himself a representative of Bima sakti and emissary of Batara Bayu. This undoubtedly points to a connection between the léyak faith and the figure of Bima-Bhairawa. It is, however, not clear to me whether the mantraBhimaçakti (has this anything to do with the Bhimas-tawa?) or the well known dark spot in the Milky Way is meant here.

On the first occasion while drunk he is thrown in the well Jalatuṇḍå by the Korawa; on the second he acts drunk in the episode of the lacquer house. The original significance of the statement in the rĕrĕnggan about his “evasion of the five evil passions” also appears to me to have been censored (Goris, Djåwå, 1927, p. 111), especially as it is related to the five-colored polèng, which we encountered again with Bhairawa. Originally the meaning was probably that he exercised the five passions (the five rituals mentioned above?) ritually, which has to be camouflaged for the general public. Cf. the lakon Pĕjahipun Dursascma, in which Bima drinks the blood from the corpse of his enemy. I wish to draw attention, superfluously perhaps, to the demonic features in the physiognomy of the Bhīma of the reliefs and of the Bima puppet in the wayang, which differentiate it entirely from that of his brothers (round eyes, protruding nose, knots above the nose, etc.).

After what has been said above I would not be surprised if Bhīma had also been associated in some manner to Buddhist schools of deliverance; in the matter of deliverance practices, the distinction in Java between Çiwaism and Buddhism was extremely narrow. From a perusal of a translation of the Dewaruci (Middle Javanese tembang, Ms. Bg. No. 279) received from Dr. Poerbatjaraka, I found that Bhīma’s teacher Dewaruci is there described in the following terms: jtnarsi,
buddhatatwarṣi, janārdana, ādibuddharṣi, and finally, werocana! Inasmuch as Dr. Bosch has informed me that he plans to publish some further particulars in this connection, I refer the reader to this publication. [See India Antiqua, pp. 57–62].

One may well wonder about the influence of Wāyu who, after all, is considered the corporal father of Bhīma and who gave him as a brother Hanumat. In my opinion, however, not too much importance is to be attached to that paternity in the popular



36
representations in Java; in the Archipelago Wāyu has even been eliminated as father of Hanumat by the representation that the latter in reality was the son of Rāma and Añjanā and that Wāyu merely acted as intermediary (See Ramalegenden und Ramareliefs in Indonesien, I, pp. 94 ff.). Winternitz further points out that the episode in which Wāyu functions as the father of Bhīma cannot belong to the core of the Mahābhārata (Geschichte der Indischen Literatur, I (1909), p. 276). From the examination of the Rāma stories cited above we know furthermore that in the Archipelago we may expect earlier rather than later official versions of the Hindu epics. For these and other reasons I am constrained to consider Wāyu in the popular representations in this connection as being of secondary importance, however much his paternity of Bhīma may have been highlighted under the influence of the kāwya literature, which was current among the kakawin in Java. In any event, I would not attach such a great importance to his paternity as to explain all of Bima’s nlystic characteristics as being derived from him, even though I quite agree with Goris that the association of Wāyu = windgod with Wāyu = breath, spirit of life, must have had a considerable influence on the Bima mysticism. It is a fact, however, that in the Bima writings our hero has been associated with Guru = Çiwa, but not with Wāyu. There, Déwaruci “reveals” to Bima that he really descends from Batara Guru: perhaps we must interpret this as an intentional correction of the Wāyu legend. (In passing I wish to observe that the identification of Nawaruci (Déwaruci) with Çiwa, made by Berg in his Inleiding, p. 109, footnote 2, is not so obvious to me. Nawaruci is the Acintya, the “not-being”, in my opinion the portrayal of a philosophical concept. In present-day Balinese art it is represented as a small creature, sexless, with strong, magic colorings, formed from personified mantras. This creature is never associated with Çiwa. Çiwa is much inferior to the Acintya, as this wondrous unreal character is called. In my opinion it is undoubtedly this creature that is meant by Nawaruci, not a god, there fore, but the personified, mystic mythicphilosophical, highest attainable perfection, the hakīkah, or if one prefers, the nirwāṇa. Compare the above passages from the Déwaruci, where he (== Nawaruci) is called Wai-rocana, who also rates higher than Çiwa.

This may well be interpreted as “asceticism in order to obtain supernatural powers for the coming battle.” Thus, apparently do the Korawa consider Bima’s stay in the caul, whereupon they are advised to do likewise so that they will not fall behind the Pĕṇḍawas in “kasaktèn”.

Most names of buta-kings start with Kala-, but often cannot be traced to the Sanskrit original, the ḍalang usually having taken greater liberties with respect to them than with respect to the Pāṇḍawa and Kaurawa. From the liberties taken even at present with the lakon by the ḍalang — especially from the kraton — it may be readily assumed that the old names were changed in order to make an allusion to persons who were not too highly thought of. Even today figures cherished by the king are given prominence; others are used to make subtle allusions, disparaging or complimentary, to persons or events. In the event that the king enjoys seeing two figures which date from entirely different periods, no scruples are felt about violating historical legend and creating a so-called charangan lakon in which both figures appear on the scene simultaneously. A similar motivation probably gave rise to the creation of the Rama nitis (Catalogus Juynboll, II, p. 74).

Here as well as in version B we have, in the words of Rouffaer, something very important, viz., that Bima here becomes identified with Gaṇeça (Gajahséna) ; this is again something entirely outside the ancient concept of Bhīma’s relationship with Wāyu, but more closely akin to the correlation Bhīma-Çiwa. The fact that our hero is identified with Gaṇeça is not as strange as it appears, since the latter is especially known as the remover of all obstacles, something which is equally true of Bima. As is known, both have the nāgopawīta. It would be interesting to determine where else this identification can be found. In his book about the wayang purwa Kats says at p. 255 that the “elephant Sena” (of a filial relationship to Guru no mention is made) is sent by Guru, breaks the caul and then “disappears like the wind”. If we are to consider this as meaning a rapid disappearance, then it has no significance in our case; if it is a less fortunate expression of “to disappear into nothing,” than one may speak of an identification. Cohen Stuart, I : XII, note 22, does speak of Gajahséna as Guru’s son, but not of a rebirth as Bima.

Smiths drew their powers to forge a kris from the god of fire; and a Smithy is considered as a Shrine. HinduJavanese Kingship was sometimes legitimated and empowered by the possession of a kris.
The elephant head figure with a crown in the Smithy relief depicts Ganesha, the God who removes obstacles in Hinduism. The Ganesha figure, however, differs in some small respects with other usual depictions. Instead of sitting, the Ganesha figure in Candi Sukuh's relief is shown dancing and it has distinctive features including the EXPOSED GENITALIA, the demonic physiognomy, the strangely awkward dancing posture, the rosary bones on its neck and holding a small animal, probably a dog.
The Ganesha relief in Candi Sukuh has a similarity with the Tantric ritual found in the history of Buddhism in Tibet written by Taranatha.[5] The Tantric ritual is associated with several figures, one of whom is described as the "King of Dogs" (Sanskrit: Kukuraja), who taught his disciples by day, and by night performed Ganacakra in a burial ground or charnel ground.
The forging of iron, and in particular of the iron knife-blades known as Kris, or Keris, had a Spiritual Significance in Indonesia that is comparable to the special importance of swordmaking in Japan. The Indonesian iron-worker was allocated to a special caste, that stood outside the typical Hindu caste system and did not necessarily yield, in precedence, even to Brahmins.[unquote]

Bhima. Candi Sukuh. Indonesia. Bhima Relief In Wayang Style - A Carving Depicting A Womb with Mythological Creatures. "The subject of this relief is Bhima, a hero of the Mahabharata, posed opposite a God on pedestal within a horseshoe-shaped arch. The sides of the arch are formed by the exaggerated tails of two birds, whose heads and bodies appear below the relief. A kala-like ogre is placed at the top, between two more ogre faces at the tips of the birds' tails. The central figures are sculpted in Wayang Puppet style, and indeed resemble their leather-puppet counterparts in posture, costume, and sideways presentation. A triad of indistinct figures appears below, in the narrow neck of the arch; the upper figure of the triad supports a Shrine or pavilion on his upraised hand, while the bottom two figures appear to Pass something between them."

Bhima Overcomes A Foe "These reliefs show Bhima rushing into battle, with bow and spear. He is preceded by a smaller standard-bearer, whose flag is emblazoned with Bhima's image; appropriately, since Bhima was of course the general of his troops. The hero's curling hair is distinctive, and appears on both images of him.
In this relief, mighty Bhima (identified by his curled hair, as on the previous page) lifts a foe off the ground by the sheer strength of his arm. Behind the hero is one of his followers, a soldier equipped with shield and spear. An inscription above Bhima's head tells the story."

"Bhima (Bima) is the second of the Pandava (Pandawa) brothers in the Mahabharata, a great Hindu epic. He is the divine son of the wind god Vayu (Bayu), and is known for his military skill, physical power, bravery, and voracious appetite. Although Bhima has a tendency to demonstrate a lack of selfcontrol, his intentions are always honest and noble. While in exile because his brother Yudhishthira (Yudistira) has lost their kingdom in a gambling bet, Bhima marries the princess giant Hidhimba (Arimbi), with whom he has a son, who is named Ghatotkacha (Gatotkaca). Having descended from the wind god, Bhima has the ability to fly, as does his half-brother Hanuman (Hanoman) and his son Ghatotkacha.
In one story from the Mahabharata, the fierce warrior Bhima defeats a dragon, which then transforms itself into a poisonous serpent. Bhima wraps the serpent around his neck, declaring that it may bite him should he ever tell a lie."

"In the Mahābhārata, Bhima (Sanskrit: भीम, IAST: Bhīma, Tibetan: མི་འཇིགས་སྟན ; Wylie: mi 'jigs
stan) is one of the central characters of Mahabharata and the second of the Pandava brothers. Bhima was distinguished from his brothers by his great stature and strength.
His legendary prowess is celebrated in the epic: "Of all the wielders of the mace, there is none equal to Bhima; and there is none also who is so skillful a rider of elephants. In fight, they say, he yields not even to Arjuna; and as to might of arms, he is equal to ten thousand elephants. Well-trained and active, he who hath again been rendered bitterly hostile, would in anger consume the Dhritarashtra in no time. Always wrathful, and strong of arms, he is not capable of being subdued in battle by even Indra himself. Bhima a Maharati, capable of fighting 60,000 warriors at once, so mighty was he that when he were to roar in anger he would put to shame the proudest lion and frighten the most fearless warrior." en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima

Mumbai: Bhima, the strongest of all the Pandavas, who along with his brothers was responsible for uprooting the existence of the Kauravas, was born to Kunti, the first wife of King Pandu.
But he was born out of a boon to Kunti after she had invoked Vayu Devata. He wasn’t Pandu’s biological son.
Here’s the legend behind Bhima’s birth
King Pandu had unknowingly shot Rishi Kindama (in disguise as a male deer) with an arrow while the latter was engaged in lovemaking with a female deer. The Rishi had great inhibitions about making love in the presence of humans and to quench his sexual needs, he would transform into a deer with his special powers. Mistaking Rishi Kindama to be a deer, King Pandu shot him thereby injuring him seriously. Angered after being injured, Rishi Kindama curses the king by telling him that he would meet death if he ever tried to make love with a woman.
Saddened by the curse, Pandu, who wishes to have children, reminded his first wife Kunti to use the boons granted to her by Rishi Durvasa. Thus, Yudishthira was born to Kunti after she was blessed by Yama and then Vayu Devata blessed her with Bhima.
Bhima and Hanuman
Hanuman was born to Anjana after she was blessed by Lord Shiva. The Lord had asked Vayu Devata to bring a portion of the divine pudding that was being consumed by Dasharatha’s queens in Ayodhaya, for Anjana. After consuming the pudding, Anjana was blessed by Vayu and granted her wish to have a child. Since he was responsible for bringing the pudding, he was rightfully the father of Anjana’s child.



57
Since both Hanuman and Bhima were born after being blessed by Vayu, they were brothers.
Many of us are not familiar with Hidimbi, whose selflessness contributed a lot to the victory of the Pandavas against the Kauravas.
We often tend to remember only those characters that play lead characters thereby forgetting the significant roles played by the lesser known or popular ones. We all know Draupadi as the wife of the Pandava brothers, daughter of King Panchal and the soul-sister of Lord Krishna. But many of us are not familiar with Hidimbi, whose selflessness contributed a lot to the victory of the Pandavas against the Kauravas.
Who was Hidimbi?
Hidimbi was the sister of Hidimba, a rakshas.
How, when and where did she meet Bhima?
During their exile, the Pandavas dwelled in forests. One night, when the rest of the brothers were asleep, Bhima remained awake to keep a watch. On smelling the presence of humans around, Hidimba asked his sister Hidimbi to lure Bhima and convince him to get eaten by them. Hidimbi met Bhima in disguise of a beautiful woman and instantly fell in love with him. And hence she confessed to him about her real identity.
Bhima, known for his strength and valour, refused to pardon Hidimba. The two indulged in a fight that resulted in Bhima’s victory. With Hidimba’s death, Hidimbi was orphaned. She pleaded to Bhima to marry her because she had fallen in love with him. After initially declining her proposal, Bhima married her after being asked by his mother Kunti but on one condition. He told her that he would not be able to take her to along with him after his exile period ends. She agreed to it gladly. Within a year, Hidimbi bore a son for Bhima and named him Ghatotkacha.
Ghatotkacha was raised by his mother and was later a part of the battle of Kurukshetra where he stood by his father against the Kauravas.
Her selfless contribution
Hidimbi could have been the queen of Hastinapur by virtue of her marriage to Bhima. But she chose to live in the forests and raise her son Ghatotkacha single-handedly. It was no petty sacrifice. Despite being a married woman, she lived without her husband because of the condition put forth by him. However, according to another legend Hidimbi chose to live alone to do penance.

Hidimba temple. Manali. Kullu district. Himachal Pradesh
Hidimba Devi Temple (built 1553 onward)
Hidimba Devi temple stands in the midst of a sacred cedar forest near the town of Dunghri at the verdant foot of the Himalaya mountains. The sanctuary is built over an enormous rock that juts out of the ground, worshipped as a manefestation of Durga, the "Hill Mother" or goddess of the earth. The temple was constructed in 1553 by Maharaja Bahadur Singh, who made a promise to the Hidimba deity of the Mahabharata epic.
The temple is rather unusual and is architecturally similar only to the temple of Tripura Sundari in Naggar (also in the Kulu valley). The Hidimba Devi temple is 24 meters tall and consists of three square roofs clad in timber tiles, surmounted by a cone-shaped fourth roof that is covered in brass. The interior of the temple is occupied by the large rock and contains no usuable space except for the ground floor. Curiously, a rope dangles from the ridge that is said to have been used to hang victims by the hand, who were then swung—bleeding and bruised—over the large rock in the presence of the goddess.
The base of the temple is made of whitewashed mud-covered stonework. The main doorway includes an elaborately carved wooden entrance that is believed to be over 400 years old. These and other carvings center on the goddess Durgha who is a mainstay of pan-Indian stories. However, the goddess herself is represented only once in a three inch tall brass image.

During the Pandava's exile, when they visited Manali; Bhima, one of the five Pandavas, killed Hidimb. Thereafter, Hidimba married Bhima and gave birth to their son Ghatotkacha. The Hidimba Devi Temple has intricately carved wooden doors and a 24 meters tall wooden "shikhar" or tower above the sanctuary.[2] The tower consists of three square roofs covered with timber tiles and a fourth brass cone-shaped roof at the top. The earth goddess Durgaforms the theme of the main door carvings.[3] The temple base is made out of whitewashed, mud-covered stonework. An enormous rock occupies the inside of the temple, only a 7.5 cm (3 inch) tall brass image representing goddess Hidimba Devi. A rope hangs down in front of the rock,and according to a legend,in bygone days religious zealots would tie the hands of "sinners" by the rope and then swing them against the rock.[4]
About seventy metres away from the temple, there is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Hidimba's son, Ghatotkacha, who was born after she married Bhima...
The Indian epic Mahabharata narrates that the Pāndavas stayed in Himachal during their exile. In Manali, the strongest person there, named Hidimba and brother of Hidimdi, attacked them, and in the ensuing fight Bhima, strongest amongst the Pandavas, killed him. Bhima and Hidimba's sister, Hidimbi, then got married and had a son, Ghatotkacha, (who later proved to be a great warrior in the war against Kauravas). When Bhima and his brothers returned from exile, Hidimbi did not accompany him, but stayed back and did tapasyā (a combination of meditation, prayer, and penance) so as to eventually attain the status of a goddess.

Bhimsen and Ghatotkacha http://openlibrary.org/books/OL23365037M/Mahabharata.
Ghatotkacha (Sanskrit: घटोत्क च Ghaṭōtkaca "Bald Pot") is an important character in the Mahabharata.His name comes from his head, which was hairless (utkaca) and shaped like a ghatam. Ghatotkacha was the son of the Pandava Bhima and the Rakshasi Hidimbi. His maternal parentage made him half-Rakshasa and gave him many magical powers such as the ability to fly, to increase or decrease his size and to become invisible. He was an important fighter from the Pandava side in the Kurukshetra war.
Ghatotkacha was born to Hidimbi and the Pandava Bhima. When traveling the countryside with his brothers and mother as a brahmin, having escaped the lakshagraha, Bhima saved Hidimbi from her wicked brother Hidimba. Soon after Ghatotkacha was born, Bhima had to leave his family, as he still had duties to complete at Hastinapura. Ghatotkacha grew up under the care of Hidimbi. One day he received a pearl which he later gave to his cousin Abhimanyu. Like his father Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the mace. Lord Krishna gave him a boon that no one in the world would be able to match his sorcery skills (except Krishna himself).His wife was Ahilawati and his sons were Barbarika and Meghvarna.
In the Mahābhārata, Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the Kurukshetra battle. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of Jayadratha on the fourteenth day of battle, when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective.
At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader Duryodhana appealed to Karna, to kill Ghatotkacha as the whole Kaurava army was coming close to annihilation due to Ghatotkacha's attacks. Karna possessed a divine weapon called the Vasavi Shakti, granted by



64
the god Indra. Only able to use it once, Karna had been saving it for his battle with his rival, Arjuna. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna discharged the weapon against Ghatotkacha, killing him. It is said that when Ghatotkacha realized that he was going to die, that he assumed a gigantic size. When the huge body fell, it crushed one akshauhini of the Kaurava army.[5] After his death Krishna was glad Karna no longer had Vasavi Sakthi to use against Arjuna.
