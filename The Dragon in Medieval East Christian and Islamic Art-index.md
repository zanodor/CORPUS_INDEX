Wie sollten wir jener alten Mythen vergessen können, die am Anfange aller Völker stehen, der Mythen von den Drachen, die sich im äußersten Augenblick in Prinzessinnen verwandeln; vielleicht sind alle Drachen unseres Lebens Prinzessinnen, die nur darauf warten, uns einmal schön und mutig zu sehen.

less, an altered context, especially if it involves a transfer from one faith to another – such as Isis suckling Harpocrates, often regarded as an immediate model for the Christian image of the Virgin and Child – can trigger unexpected accretions and adaptations of meaning Thus there can develop over the centuries a pool of ideas associated with a given image, and it requires expert judgment and erudition to make the right choices from that pool in any particular case The body of evidence and allusion that accumulates in this way becomes increasingly difficult to control and to understand Such, then, are some of the difficulties confronting an extensive iconographical study of the kind that Dr Kuehn has produced To overcome those difficulties calls for a special kind of scholar, one that was much more commonly encountered several generations ago Happily Dr Kuehn fits that bill, and has the sheer erudition, the wideranging sympathies, the creative imagination and the indefatigable intellectual curiosity to match Methodically and passionately she follows the leads of her research wherever they take her, crossing numerous disciplinary boundaries en route
The result is a many-textured study of remarkable boldness and finesse that, firmly grounded in the thought-worlds of Bronze Age Central Asia and the Hellenistic empire, explores the full flowering of the serpent-dragon motif in medieval East Christian and Islamic art, most especially in Anatolia The range of reference is extensive – from the mythic origins of the theme to such detailed aspects as the dragon tamer, combat scenes, the significance of knotting, and the serpent-dragon as an element of personal adornment We learn of its interaction with other animals and how it functioned as an emblem of war and of the hunt, as a guardian of treasure and as an avatar of chthonic powers; and its sinister side helps to explain its appearance in Christian contexts in association with such saints as George and Theodore yet it also had multiple royal and heroic associations, as shown for example by the dracontine throne with its apotropaic role Small wonder that this fabulous creature developed an apocalyptic significance and figured largely in the Islamic sciences
This book is part of a much longer and comprehensive study on which Dr Kuehn has been labouring for over a decade and whose aim is to trace the iconography of the composite mythical creature known as the serpent-dragon from the mists of antiquity to the later middle ages Her geographical focus in the study as a whole is principally Western and Central Asia but she remains continually alert to the manifestations of her theme in neighbouring cultures to the east (including India and China) and the west The continuity of this arresting image across vast gulfs of space and time in the most diverse cultures of the Old World from the Atlantic to the Pacific is quite startling That continuity in itself constitutes a major challenge to anyone seeking to tell a connected story that extends across continents, cultures and millennia The volume of scholarship on the art of Western and Central Asia has grown exponentially in the last couple of generations In the field of Islamic art alone, it is clearly no longer a reasonable ambition to produce a companion volume to Creswell’s magisterial Bibliography of the Architecture, Arts and Crafts of Islam to 1st Jan. 1960; such a work would need to be several times the size and weight of that huge tome in order to cover what has been produced in the last fifty years But as the volume of scholarship expands, so, by a seemingly ineluctable law, does its scope contract More and more people write about less and less The dangers of over-specialisation and tunnel vision loom large Artificial boundaries, whether chronological, geographical, cultural or confessional, are set and then ferociously policed Scholarship operates in watertight compartments, to the detriment of that open-mindedness, that cross-fertilisation of disciplines and, more generally, the linking of disparate bodies of information that have traditionally been regarded as the litmus text of creative thinking in academe Iconographical studies are especially vulnerable to this shift from the macroscopic to the microscopic mode Images readily adapt to changes in use, in faith and context, not to mention changes in location or scale, but they do tend to guard their core meanings most tenaciously Neverthe

one culture to another – classical, Christian, Zoroastrian, Islamic – in a remarkably sure-footed way It is packed with cogent arguments and unexpected insights Dr Kuehn is a born explorer and has a natural affinity for cross-cultural work She disdains the quick fix and is ready to do whatever is required to prove her point Her list of authorities is startling in its length and completeness But those authorities are merely a means to an end – the tale’s the thing, and it casts a potent spell

The aim of this research is to contextualise and chart, as far as possible, the complex iconography of the dragon in the medieval Islamic world,1 by interrogating the many factors, contexts and contingencies that helped to shape and transform it 2 The study focuses on the identification of the dragon imagery in a medieval Central Asian3 cultural context, in what may be described as Irano-Turkish territories, from where it was disseminated by people of predominantly Turkic and Iranian stock 4 It necessarily draws on a vast corpus of imagery of long artistic and iconographic tradition which originates from an equally vast geographic area of enormous cultural and ethnic complexity, with a primary emphasis on the transmission of the dragon iconography from Central Asia to Anatolia Importantly, the latter comprises to a large extent parts of the region that formed part of the empire of Alexander the Great at his death in 323 bc, constituting ancient Sogdia, Bactria, the Indus Valley, Parthia, Media, the Transcaucasus and Anatolia A common feature of these regions is therefore to have been subject for three to four centuries to intermittent waves of Hellenistic influence Arab conquests of Central Asia began to gain momentum from 86/705 when Qutayba ibn Muslim was appointed governor of Khurasan, from where he led incursions into neighbouring regions 5 This led to a process of Islamicisation in the city states of sedentary Central Asia and the subsequent transformation of the entire region
into a centre of Islamic civilisation It also resulted in the assimilation and subsequent Islamicisation of the steppe peoples of Turko-Mongol heritage Islamic-period Central Asia naturally inherited artistic traditions from preceding dynasties such as the Sasanians (c 224–651) and the Sogdians (fifth–eighth centuries) A true melting pot of peoples and cultures, the region had from earliest times served as a mediator and transmitter of artistic trends as they passed from east to west Asia and vice versa This phenomenon was taken even further in the vast spatial entity of Islam, where economic links facilitated the transmission of knowledge as well as cultural and artistic exchange among peoples of different backgrounds and thus, in spite of the multicultural setting, conveyed a feeling of unity and a sense of belonging to a common civilisation 6 Medieval Islamic society was a mixture of several regional cultures which included Muslims and non-Muslims speaking many languages, including Arabic, Persian, Syriac, Hebrew, Armenian, Turkish, Kurdish and various local dialects The approach in the following essays is thus necessarily broadly comparative since evidently, as Julie Scott Meisami has aptly put it, “the medieval world does not stop at, say, the border between Christian Byzantium and Islamic territories, it is also clear that valuable insights may be gained from comparing the various manifestations of what is, to a great extent, a unified tradition, which shares certain basic attitudes and assumptions despite the par
1 Throughout this investigation the traditional historical era, commonly referred to as the medieval period, is defined as spanning the eighth to the thirteenth century 2 On the history of the study of iconography in Islamic art, see the recent resumé of Ernst Grube (2005, pp 13–33) with an extensive list of references 3 Today “Central Asia” has acquired a narrower meaning associating it with its use in the former Soviet Union and can be said to include the territories of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan as well as Mongolia, the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Province in northwest China However throughout the present study the term is used in its broader sense following the cultural definition of Central Asia given by UNESCO in two meetings of experts, held in 1978 and 1979, which is anchored in the multi-volume History of Civilization of Central Asia The Final Report of 12 February 1979, Paris, reads that the spatial dimensions include “territories lying at present within the boundaries of Afghanistan, the western
part of China, northern India, northeastern Iran, Mongolia, Pakistan and the [former] Central Asian Republics of the USSR ” See Miroshnikov, 1992, repr 1999, pp 259–80 (the discussion also includes a brief outline of the historical usage of the term) The problems of defining the conceptual geographies of Central Asia are revisited by Akiner, 1998, pp 3–62 4 The words “Turkic” as well as “Iranian” are used as general designations to denote people whose ruler or majority spoke a Turkic or an Iranian language Tribal confederacies in Central Asia were very heterogeneous and under various cultural influences Cf Frye, 2005, p 149, n 1 5 On the Muslim Arab campaign in Central Asia and subsequent consolidation of power, see the classical study of Gibb, 1923 6 The accounts of medieval travellers show that there were, in fact, apart from sea frontiers, no clearly defined boundary lines within the Islamic empire See Bauer, 1995, pp 34–6

late third millennium bc This body of evidence is investigated by the present writer in a separate, forthcoming monograph which discusses the dragon iconography from 2500 bc to 650 ad See also Kuehn, 2009, pp 43–67 8 The application of this term has been questioned since it seems to exclude geographically the important branch of the same culture that inhabited Mongolia Cf Jacobson, 1999, p 173
7 The dragon (together with its smaller relative, the serpent, as will be shown) is a universally attested motif, perhaps generated simultaneously by a number of cultures An “Eastern,” and more specifically “Central Asian,” provenance can therefore not be inferred for one of the most ancient iconographies of mankind However extensive material evidence of the motif, so far fairly unknown, has been discovered in the Central Asia region from at the least the
to the region of Bactria that lies between the mountains of the Hindu Kush and the classical Oxus river (known as Āmū Daryā) Known as the Kushāṇas, they entered the Eurasian heartlands and the Indian subcontinent in the first or second centuries ad Under subsequent Central Asian dynasties such as the Sasanians and Sogdians (who were closely linked with the Turkic empires and played the role of active agents of cultural interaction), the dragon motif continued to be extensively employed and was to become a prominent emblem of the Great Saljuq Turks This so-called “Saljuq-style” dragon was a motif in common currency from Central Asia to Anatolia (Rūm, the “Roman”/Byzantine lands) long before its place was taken by a so-called “Chinese-style” dragon, introduced in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion during the rule of the Chaghatayids (624/1227–764/1363), the Batuʾids (624/1227–907/1502) and the Ilkhanids (654/1256–754/1353) when China marked one pole of the Mongol empire at its time of greatest territorial expansion This gave rise to a Chinese and Chinese-inspired but Mongol version of the dragon that began to appear for instance on the tile revetments of the Ilkhanid summer residence at Takht-i Sulaimān, built in the 1270s in the Azerbaijan region of present-day Iran, as well as in some early fourteenth-century manuscripts The transmission of the visual rendering of the motif was the result of an acculturation process in which it was translated into a Central Asian context The focus of this study is precisely on the manifestations of the dragon as evinced in the cultural and artistic context of the medieval Central Asian world before the phenomenon of the “Chinese-style” dragon occurred in the arts of Islam during the latter half of the thirteenth and fourteenth century with the establishment of the Mongols in Central Asia Examples dating to after the Mongol invasion are employed only in so far as they illustrate a particularly pertinent symbolic feature in the stylistic continuation of the “Saljuq-style” dragon (the term “Saljuq” being used throughout this study in an extended sense, geographically and chronologically) The issue of
ticular local colouring of the individual cultures that make up the whole ” Therefore, since it pertains to more than one culture and geographical region, the study necessarily addresses the multicultural and hybrid facets of the dragon motif as it evolved in these regions and examines how the motif was accepted and incorporated into the artistic repertory An investigation into the visual phenomenon of the dragon, which evolved from its pre-Islamic origins to manifest itself in varied but analogous and interrelated forms across this wide spatial and temporal entity, necessitates a broad overview of the entire spectrum of images as they appear on diverse media In doing so the study, moreover, inevitably exhibits some of the difficulties arising from the necessity of crossing academic boundaries An interdisciplinary method of analysis has been pursued, involving not only art historical but literary, epigraphical and historical evidence During the ten years it took to compile the vast body of data the sheer scope of the material, in cultural, confessional, geographical and chronological terms, threatened to overwhelm all attempts at containment and control Necessarily, given the vastness of the subject, only certain aspects of the multilayered and multivalent character of the topic can be treated This study identifies and discusses specific themes pertaining to the dragon iconography which can be observed over a long period of time The likeness of the dragon is commonly associated with Asia and more specifically with China, being a paramount Chinese emblem yet its iconographic expression was known and used in a Central Asian context during the Bronze Age period, i e from the late third to early second millennium bc,7 and was again extensively employed in the so-called “animal style” which was transmitted in the wake of the migrations of the ancient nomads of the Scytho-Siberian culture 8 The late outflows of the culture which produced this style include, for instance, the Xiongnu of Mongolia and the yuezhi (Rouzhi), who were driven out of present-day Gansu province in China by the Xiongnu in the second century bc and migrated

9 Le Goff, 1980, p 162 10 A collection of stories in Arabic, Thousand and One Nights, appears to have formed around a Persian framework and to have developed with many additions from various locations from the ninth and tenth centuries, taking final shape in the thirteenth century Cf Littmann, “Alf layla wa-layla,” EI2 I, 358b 11 Cf Tausendundeine Nacht (Brandenburg, 1973, p 70), which contains this episode 12 Rīzā Qulī Khān Hidāyat, Majmaʿ al-fuṣaḥāʾ, ed
The tenth-century compilations of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ (Brethren of Purity), a sect of the Ismāʿīlis, similarly note that the dragon, king of all crawling creatures, has the viper as wazīr 13 That the dragon is in fact a large serpent is noted much earlier in the writings of the fifth-century Armenian apologist, Eznik of Koghb 14 Literary sources of various types, from practical writings (that is to say, pharmacopoeia, travelogues or books on magic), to theological and exegetical writings, poetry, fables and in particular epics,15 such as the early eleventh-century Persianlanguage masterpiece, the Shāh-nāma (“Book of Kings”), prove invaluable in the effort to establish a relationship between dragon iconography and its possible iconological content, in other words the endlessly varied contemporary cultural concepts that generated these notions Such variations result in an apparently limitless repertoire of iconographical formulae for the dragon which, according to the Shāh-nāma:
lived in the water and overland now in the river and anon in the sun [i e , on the earth], and could pull a ferocious elephant with its tail 16
This verse describes the dragon’s ability to undergo environmental and spatial changes In his wellknown bestiary, Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā (“The Life of the Biggest Animals”), the fourteenth-century scholar Kamāl al-Dīn al-Damīrī (745/8081344/1405) similarly observes that:
Serpents are originally in their nature aquatic [creatures] and can live in the sea after having been land ones, and on land after having been marine ones 17
Allusions such as these reveal that the dragon was able to cross boundaries within its natural environment, metamorphosing from land to sea creature and vice versa The physical changes accompanying such shape-shifting all form part of the dragon iconography in medieval Islamic art so that the creature is, for instance, portrayed variously without legs, with two forelegs or with
inherent parallels in artistic expression as well as the adaptation and incorporation of seemingly “Chinese” and Chinese-inspired Mongol stylistic formulae, in particular under the Ilkhanids, and their amalgamation with the visual contexts of the Central Asian region will be addressed in the first part of the Epilogue
Characteristics of the (serpent-)dragon
Since earliest antiquity the dragon has been a richly multivalent symbol of complex mythical and symbolic value characterised by a coalescence of maleficence and beneficence Owing to this inherent polyvalence and ambiguity, it has been called “one of the most complex symbolisms of the history of cultures ”9 Its iconography is a recurring and popular image in the architecture and the arts of the medieval Islamic world yet despite its wide diffusion, the symbolism that survives from the Central Eurasian world of the medieval period is often elusive and even cryptic The composite mythical creatures are endowed with features or parts belonging to various animals generally recognisable across cultural-aesthetic boundaries, the reptilian, feline and raptorial motif being prevalent in the overall composition; they thus often carry chthonic, aquatic and aerial aspects It is however the reptilian characteristics that predominate in the iconography of the medieval Central Asian dragon This is not only displayed in visual information but also demonstrated by written sources In a passage from the Arabian collection of tales of the Alf layla wa-layla (“Thousand and One Nights”),10 the physician asks the slave girl Tawaddud to name him a serpent that lays eggs In response she names the dragon, in other words, a grown serpent 11 The same notion is expressed by the Ghaznawid poet Masʿūd-i Razī when he advises sulṭān Masʿūd ibn Maḥmūd of Ghazna (r 421/1030–432/1040):
Do not extend security and do not give time and opportunity [to the enemy] Given time the snake turns into a dragon 12

However, unlike in most of Christian culture where the overall image of the serpent or dragon is predominantly associated with its portrayal in the Bible as the epitome of evil and sin,21 the position of serpents and dragons in Islamic culture is ambiguous and can have benevolent as well as malevolent connotations The serpent as symbol of evil does not exist in the Qurʾān where it appears only once in the story of the staff of Mūsā (Moses) metamorphosed into a serpent (sūras 20, 20; and 79, 16) 22 However, both serpents and dragons figure more frequently in Persian than in Arabic tradition This ambiguity in the nature of the dragon is also mirrored in the Persian language, the word for dragon (azdahā) being used to describe “a strong and brave man,” or “passionate testy person” as well as “a tyrant ”23 A positive image of serpents or dragons as powerful, friendly and helpful beings persists in Arabic as well as Persian poetry 24 A grateful serpent is depicted in the pre-Islamic Arab writings of the sixth-century poet ʿAbid ibn al-Abraṣ who when travelling through the desert with members of his tribe, the Banū Asad, took pity on a serpent that was tormented by thirst and gave it his last drops of water to drink During the night the camels bolted and vanished When ʿAbid, close to despair, was searching for his mount, he heard the voice of the grateful serpent offering him a camel to ride Because of his meritorious act ʿAbid was thus one of the surviving members of the outing to return to the clan 25 Another story of a lifesaving serpent is recorded by al-Damīrī, citing the shaykh Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad al-Muzayyin al-Ṣagīr al-Ṣūfī (d 328/939–40), who fell into a well in the desert of Tabūk and was saved by a viper which, he states:
...wound itself round me, whilst I remained perfectly still in my heart without any emotion; it then twisted its tail round me and took me out
four legs It may thus have a quadruped body, a serpentine body or a quadruped protome extending into ophidian coils Overall however the serpentine body with or without legs enjoyed greater prominence In its astrological manifestation, the dragon necessarily has a celestial quality which, as the sage astrologer Jāmāsp relates to Gushtāsp (Av Wishtāspa, the Greek Hystaspes), the Kayanian king of Iranian traditional history and first Mazdaist on the throne, is all-powerful:
No one can safely pass that fateful wheel Who has by wisdom or by manliness escaped the knifesharp claws of that celestial dragon? What has to be will be There is no doubt The shrewdest man has not escaped his fate 18
The avian aspect of the dragon is often expressed through its portrayal with wings The latter are associated with the power of flight, a well-known vehicle for the transition from one realm into another An early Armenian translation of the thirdcentury Christian theologian Origen’s writings underlines the fiendish nature of the dragon:
And we call vishap many of the largest animals; of those on land, the elephant and the serpent, and an evil and violent man, but when the names are once applied, they do not change their nature We call vishap also the invisible evil power, which, asking power of the Lord, struck the righteous man with grievous blows, not in one part, but in all his parts, outer and inner 19
yet it is also interesting to note the assertion that vishaps (Av vishāpa) can fly, as stated by the thirteenth-century Armenian philosopher and historian, Wahrām Wardapet (also known as Rabuni Sevleṛnts ʿi), in a letter to the Armenian king Hetʿum of Cilicia (Lesser Armenia, Armenian kingdom from 1198–1375):
Many men have seen vishaps ascend from earth to heaven 20

yasht hymn (“Songs of Praise”) collection of the surviving Avestan texts, the earliest scriptures of the ancient Persian religion, Zoroastrianism, lists not only various types of legendary or mythical “first man” or “first king,” but also dragon men and killers of dragons, transmitted mainly from the Indo-Iranian period 31 The later Zoroastrian scriptures of the Vidēvdāt (Vendidād), perhaps influenced by the customs of the Median priests, the Magi,32 contained a radically reconfigured view of the universe The “law against the daevas” divided “creation into two mutually antagonistic halves—the creatures of the Holy Spirit on the one hand and the creatures of the Destructive Spirit on the other ”33 According to this understanding serpents or dragons (Av azhi-, Pahl azh-) were identified as creatures of the “hostile spirit” Ahriman They were defined as evil, noxious, harmful to man and his animals and crops (Av khrafstra)34 and thus deserving of death 35 This inherent ambiguity is exemplified in the demon Azhi Dahāka/Azhdahāk found in the Avestan texts, the notorious dragon who tried to seize the khvarәnah- (Mid Pers khwarrah “glory, God-given fortune, splendour”) of Iran’s Aryan rulers of traditional history, attempting, in other words, to make himself ruler of the Aryans 36 After several great battles, he was overcome by the dragon-fighter Thraētaona/Frēdōn (the Avestic counterpart of the Vedic dragon-slayer Indra) Hence from an early time, variants of this epic seem to have attributed to usurpers some traits that seem to have been borrowed from the dragonman 37 Long familiar as a monstrous tyrant,38 he becomes in New Persian or Arabic narratives the Babylonian tyrant Ẓaḥḥāk (al-Ḍaḥḥāk)/Dahāk, who belonged to the Pīshdādian, the early mythi

Owing to the instigation of the bird of Paradise, the peacock (ṭāʾūs), which he saw at the gate of Paradise, Iblīs made use of the serpent and managed to trick her by speaking to her in a soft voice until she had confidence in him:
she opened her mouth, Iblīs jumped in and sat down between her fangs (thus the fangs of snakes became poisonous until the end of the ages)64
and so he eluded the angels guarding Paradise who would not have admitted him A narrative ascribed to Wahb ibn Munabbih (b 34/654–5), a yemenite descendant from a family of Persian origin, describes the Fall which led to the expulsion from Paradise:
When Iblīs wanted to cause [Adam and Eve] to slip, he entered into the stomach (jawf) of the serpent; the serpent [then] had four legs and was like a Bactrian [camel] (bukhtīya), one of the most beautiful creatures God had created When the serpent entered the garden, Iblīs came out of its stomach (jawf); he took [a fruit] from the tree [the Tree of Immortality (Qurʾān, sūra 20, 116–21)] that God had forbidden to Adam and Eve and brought it to Eve 65
As a consequence of the service rendered to Iblīs, the serpent is not only banished from Paradise, but loses her legs, which reenter her body; she will dwell in dark places and only earth will be her food;66 she is condemned to crawl on her belly becoming “malformed and deprived of the power of speech, mute and forked-tongued ”67
Hayocʿ (“History of the Armenians”), which is ostensibly written in the fifth century but probably dated to the mid-eighth century in its present form,55 the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene (Movsēs Khorenatsi) calls the neighbouring Medes, mar, which is a homonymic of the Persian word mār (“snake”) The History refers to their offspring as “progeny of the dragon” (vishap-azun), or human snakes,56 while the archetype of evil misrule, Azhi Dahāka/Azhdahāk, the dragon in man-shape (or the human in dragonshape)57 of the Sasanian epics, is identified with the historical Median king Astyages (Med Rishtivaiga) against whom the Armenian king Tigran rebelled 58 Khorenatsi also refers to the first century ad invading Alans, an Iranian people of the Caucasus, and their offspring, as descendants of Azhdahāk 59 The name of the latter continued to be used as a symbol for historical enemies; in particular, the new world power of the Saljuq Turks, whose conquests provoked a sense of the apocalyptic in medieval Christian Transcaucasia 60 The eleventh-century Armenian scholar and theologian, John (yovhannes) of Tarawn, declared that the Antichrist – the dragon bound, at the time of the Crucifixion, for a thousand years – was now free once again and had returned with the help of the Saljuq Turks 61 In the discussion of the story of Paradise in post-Qurʾānic canonical traditions, the serpentdragon’s inherent ambivalence is also expressed In the primordial Paradise the serpent is said to have been the most beautiful and strong of animals,62 who was:
shaped like a camel and like the camel, could stand erect She had a multi-coloured tail, red,

Existing contributions to the study of dragon iconography
As far as the symbolism of the dragon is concerned, the field for the greater part has been prepared through valuable studies in stylistic and iconographic development, of which those of Giovanni Curatola, Katharina Otto-Dorn, Gönül Öney and Abbas Daneshvari rank foremost 68 Considering the prominent position accorded to the dragon motif in the arts of the medieval Islamic period, it is however surprising that so far only Giovanni Curatola has devoted a study exclusive to this iconography and its characteristics His study, which investigates the overall relation of the dragon to Chinese and Central Asian sources as well as its appearance in manuscripts of the post-Timurid period,69 leaves room however for the exploration and identification of the larger phenomenon, its manifestations and crosscurrents across a period of many centuries and many cultures Some studies have concentrated on a specific medium Otto-Dorn70 and Öney71 have focused in particular on the monumental sculpture of Anatolia, providing an extensive catalogue of known monumental stone reliefs Individual reliefs were investigated by Jean-Paul Roux72 and Özden Süslü73 in Saljuq-period Anatolia and by Joachim Gierlichs in northern Mesopotamia (the Jazīra) 74 In a more recent work Gierlichs established an important catalogue raisonné of animal reliefs on monuments of the Saljuq and Artuqid periods and their successors throughout Anatolia and the Jazīra, focusing also on the depiction of the dragon 75 The mass of data thus assembled is truly exhaustive and provides a firm foundation for further research The present study consists of a total of 14 chapters Chapter 1 outlines the historical and cultural context within which the dragon iconography flourished in the medieval Islamic world from Central Asia to Anatolia Representations of the dragon on monumental sculpture, both Islamic and Christian, of the medieval period, mainly in

linked to the ancient concept of the royal or heroic dragon-tamer The dragon’s overall symbolism as well as the dragon-fighting myths in Old and Middle Iranian and Persian literature have been examined in depth, respectively, by Prods Oktor Skjærvø and Djalal Khāleqī-Moṭlaq,80 while its Armenian aspect is treated by James Russell 81 In his book, How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of IndoEuropean Poetics, Calvert Watkins similarly looks in detail at the structure of the ancient myths on the slaying of dragons, which recur throughout the Indo-European poetic tradition 82 Many of these topics have most recently been reinvestigated and expanded by Michael Janda in his wonderful 2010 book, Die Musik nach dem Chaos: Der Schöpfungsmythos der europäischen Vorzeit 83 The dragon combat motif played a central role mainly in the chronicles of heroic combat, in tales of romance, or in allegories of mystical initiation or religious teaching 84 The slaying or subduing of a dragon by a hero or divinity in ancient myth, and its iconography and mode of transmission in the medieval Islamic world as well as in the Eastern Christian sphere, are explored in chapter 7 A further important aspect is the eschatological role fulfilled by some dragon fighters The role of the equestrian warrior saints as dragon-slayers has been extensively researched by the prominent scholar of Byzantine hagiography and art, Christopher Walter 85 More recently Oya Pancaroğlu has examined the role of the itinerant dragonslayer in medieval Anatolia 86 Chapter 8 aims to uncover further layers of dragon iconology in the context of astrology, a highly esteemed science in the east, its association with light and its role as a vehicle to convey cosmological ideas The dragon representation in medieval Islamic astrology has been addressed in a number of studies, foremost among which remains that of Willy Hartner (1938) who demonstrated over seventy years ago the influence of the conceptualisation of the two pseudo-planetary “lunar nodes” (al-ʿuqdatāni) on Islamic artisans 87 Guitty Azarpay seeks to explain the theme of the
ments—earth, water, fire and wind They express, in a mythical language, aspects of the natural setting and the positive or dangerous qualities of those aspects, such as rain, drought or flood Their particular connection with the medium of water involves a nexus of ideas which also determines the dragon’s affinity with other symbols of fertility of the vegetal world The chthonic nature of the mythical creature may be associated with the belief in dragons guarding both treasures hidden in the earth and the sources of nature’s abundance The ability of serpents and dragons to undergo physical change underlay, moreover, their association with numinous or demonic power The overall physical division of animals from humans and the great diversity and physical distinctiveness among animal species have made animals the preferred medium for the representation of the other, non-human, sphere, which was often characterised by the effortless passage across physical and geographical boundaries Dragons within the “natural” animal species and the realm of the supernatural and the strange, as well as the visual fusion of two or more animals, are looked at in chapter 5 Beyond a relation with the “natural” world, the dragon is embued, on a cosmic level, with a more complex meaning as a bringer of stability or disorder, stasis or dynamism, life or death As mentioned earlier the mythical creature has a similar meaning on a “social” or “political” level, symbolising the enemies or, as will be shown, in some cases, the champions of a society, group or class By using the iconography of the dragon, rulers aimed to ensure symbolic control over subject dominions This pivotal role accorded to the dragon, which figures prominently in royal and heroic symbolism and as an indicator of political power, intellectual supremacy and socio-religious dominance, is discussed in chapter 6 Among those who have worked on these concepts is Eva Baer,79 who has formulated the expression and thoroughly explored the iconography of “the ruler in the cosmic setting,” a form of imagery closely

focusing on the dragon as pre-eminent symbol and paradigm of change and transformation, thus addressing a key aspect of its phenomenology The most important study of the iconography of the dragon in the cult of the saints and mystics is provided by Abbas Daneshvari,92 whose research moreover offers a significant contribution to the iconological interpretation of the multivalent symbolism of the dragon by underlining its beneficial and apotropaic aspect 93 In medieval Ṣūfīsm (taṣawwuf), the mystical dimension of Islam, the symbolism of the dragon illustrates the theme of moral transformation on the spiritual path, often mediated by the figure of a mystic The first part of the Epilogue shows how in the wake of the Mongol invasion dragon imagery appears in different stylistic guises The first half of the Ilkhanid period presents a transitional period in which a new “Chinese,” “Mongol” or, more broadly, “Central Asian” style appears which in the second half of their reign gradually overtakes and amalgamates with the conventional “Saljuq-style” dragon This emergence in the Mongol period of a hitherto unknown style, termed “Islamic chinoiserie,” from the relationship between Chinese and Iranian art, has been investigated by yuka Kadoi 94 The second part demonstrates the eminent role played by the dragon, itself the ideal image of incarnate liminality, in frontier societies in Transoxania, Khurasan and Anatolia characterised by ghāzīs fighting for the defence and victory of Islam This is evident in the epic-chivalrous frontier narratives describing jihād against dragons, as for instance in the early Turkish Anatolian epic, the Baṭṭāl-nāma (“Book of Baṭṭāl”), which was more recently translated by yorgos Dedes,95 or the epic romance of the Türkmen Dānishmend ruler, the Dānishmend-nāma (“Book of Dānishmend”), also based on orally transmitted traditions and composed in the twelfth or early thirteenth century, translated by Irène Mélikoff,96 who in the romance is identified with Sayyid Baṭṭāl 97 This phenomenon was complemented by the crosscultural convergence of saintly cults prominently
interlaced dragons in the light of its astrological significance 88 Moreover, two more recent exhibitions on celestial imagery in Islamic art in New york and Paris also included the astrological association of the dragon 89 Chapter 9 surveys a theme that has previously attracted little attention: the survival within medieval Islamic tradition of the ouroboros, the iconography of a serpent devouring its own tail Similarly, the motif of the drinking dragon on medieval Islamic and Christian two- and threedimensional art represents the visual remnants that survived the mutations of an ancient belief Likewise the knotted dragon motif in the Islamic period, related to the ancient magical practice of knot tying for apotropaic ends, discussed in chapter 10, has barely been addressed other than in connection with alchemy 90 The dragon figure also plays a role in the various branches of knowledge that comprise the science of alchemy as well as the more esoteric or occult sciences which include talismanic astrology Chapter 11 introduces aspects of the dragon as prophylaxis and cure in the province of magic and divination It discusses the dragon’s association with the theriaca as illustrated in the famed Kitāb al-diryāq. It also looks at serpents, their venoms and other characteristics as well as the corresponding antidotes, chiefly theriaca and bezoar-type stones The dragon’s role in esoteric or magical sciences, in particular sympathetic and talismanic astrological magic, as well as in the preparation of talismans is examined in chapter 12 The supernatural power of the serpent-staff is the subject of the second section of the chapter, which has been explored in terms of Jewish influences on Islamic magic by Alexander Fodor in the context of a thirteenth-century treatise in which the motif of Moses’ serpent-rod is discussed as a magical device 91 In chapter 13 the association of the dragon with the sound-world is considered One of these aspects is the speaking dragon; another more rare occurrence is its link with sounds transformed into music Chapter 14 then concludes the discussion,

98 Giovanni Curatola’s thorough work on the dragon focuses on the overall relation of its iconography to Chinese and Central Asian sources as well as its appearance in manu
of the medieval Central Asian world often remains incomprehensible for modern people Because of the refractory nature of the evidence, some iconographic elements of the period are based upon a number of deductions while some others necessarily remain elusive, even impenetrable It is therefore the intention of the present study to locate certain iconographic details that so far have not been understood or, perhaps, even recognised At the same time it has to be borne in mind that what may be considered a symbol in the twentieth century may well represent an authentic transfer of a reality for man in medieval Central Asia and beyond Even so it is hoped that the following chapters will shed some light on the perception of the great dragon beast within the overall intellectual and visual universe of the medieval Irano-Turkish world Finally, the path that has led to the realisation of this study has been long and tortuous: the serpent is not called a dragon for nothing Nonetheless, this study represents but a small contribution to a better comprehension of the complex multivalent symbolism of the dragon in the medieval Islamic sphere Some propositions consequently have a provisional character that, with the help of new material, specialists will confirm or invalidate
involving the dragon in which Islamic, TurkoMongol, Jewish and Christian beliefs overlapped and amalgamated
Since there are no previous comprehensive studies of the dragon in the Islamic world,98 the present exercise is prone to all the risks that are characteristic of such an endeavour Depictions of dragons in the material culture of the medieval Islamic period have never been fully catalogued as a corpus, hence in what follows only a representative sampling will be considered in which the selected objects are individually discussed Inevitably, numerous potentially relevant objects may have been overlooked or considered too briefly, and the aim of tracking down the exact symbolic significance of the serpent and its greater relative, the dragon, may not have been fully realised Nevertheless, the approach adopted here will at least bring into focus the complexity of the semantic horizon associated with these images This endeavour is particularly precarious since modern perception of the elements that determine different modes of interpretation will not necessarily reflect the meaning and mental associations attributed to them by the medieval populations studied Imagery that elicited clearly identifiable connotations and allusions in the cultural milieu

people that for over a millennium, since Alexander the Great (r 356–323 bc), had been subject to varying degrees of Hellenisation Throughout the Umayyad period (41/661132/750), and possibly beyond the mid-eighth century, Greek was widely current in greater Mesopotamia and Palestine as the native language of a significant portion of the population4 and was moreover cultivated in the many Christian monasteries and cloisters The cultivation of Hellenistic philosophy and science at centres of learning that had flourished during the first six centuries of the Christian era was well entrenched and further developed in the regions that were part of the Roman, later the Byzantine and Sasanian empires, and finally the caliphate, throughout the Fertile Crescent, from Edessa (al-Ruhā) and Qinnasrīn in the west, through Nisibis and Mosul in northern Mesopotamia to Jundaysābūr in Khūzistān, well into western Iran 5 To these should be added at least two other major centres of Hellenistic science and learning, Ḥarrān (ancient Carrhae) in northwestern Mesopotamia just south of Edessa In 47/667 the Muslim armies crossed the river Oxus and by 95/713 Transoxania had come within the expanding fold of Islam The Eurasian heartlands, in particular the cities of Marw and Balkh in Khurasan (covering a wide extent of land comprising regions in present-day Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Iran),6 which were well-known for their libraries until their destruction by the Mongols in the early thirteenth century, constituted an important locus for integrating and transmitting knowledge 7 After the ʿAbbasid revolution, the transfer of the seat of the caliphate from Syria to Iraq and the building in 145/762 of a new capital, Baghdad (close to the ruins of the Sasanian capital of
With its rapid expansion to the status of world power, the Islamic world became increasingly open culturally to the transmission and active appropriation of ancient learning from GraecoRoman and Indo-Iranian sources The westward movement of the culture of Western Central Asia, in particular that of greater Khurasan, resulted not only in an outflow of savants and artists from this region but in a general tendency to “Easternise ” This coincided with the westward migration of ever-growing numbers of Turkic-speaking tribes into Western Asia which increased from the late tenth century onwards From the end of the eleventh century until the onslaught of the Mongols in the mid-thirteenth century, the Saljuqs and their “successor states” ruled a large region from India to Egypt, perpetuating the heritage of Western Central Asian art and culture in their new homeland Two major currents profoundly influenced the formation of the Islamic world from its inception One was the transmission of ancient learning from the Greek, Central Asian (in particular the Iranian) and Indian cultural realms, provoking an intense intellectual ferment in the Islamic world 1 This was linked with and reflected by the second, which saw the culture of Western Central Asia flowing westwards, facilitated by the largescale migrations of Turkish-speaking people into Islamic lands from the late tenth century onwards 2 With the establishment of the Islamic polity (dār al-islām, “abode of Islam”) in the wake of the Arab conquests after the death of the Prophet Muḥammad in 10/632, the lifting of political and religious barriers from Morocco to India promoted greater movement of goods, people and ideas across a vast region 3 It united areas and

corpus of Arabic translations, the simultaneous cultural appropriation was much broader, pervading all modes of life By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Islamic culture had fully internalised and synthesised concepts emerging from a multitude of scientific works acquired largely from Graeco-Roman and Indo-Iranian sources The movement of craftsmen from eastern Islamic lands, in particular from greater Khurasan, westwards was a decisive process, which accelerated between the fall of the Iranian dynasty of the Samanids (204/819–395/1005) and the late thirteenth century, a period that might broadly be described as the Turko-Mongol era Hemmed in by deserts both to the south and the north, the Khurasan mountain range and the plains along its slopes have always represented a significant, and often the most important communication artery between east and west The tendency to easternise was initially an internal phenomenon within Western Central Asia which began with the Iranian Samanid dynasty that ruled in Transoxania (known during the Middle Ages as mā warāʾ al-nahr, “the land which lies beyond the river [Oxus]” at the eastern margin of Khurasan facing the still pagan Turks) and then in Khurasan from the ninth century onwards For a time, the Samanids constituted the border between the Islamicised lands and the still incompletely Islamicised Turkic dynasty of the Qarakhanids East of the regions dominated by the Qarakhanids were the lands of the Oghuz tribes from whom the Saljuqs would emerge Under the aegis of the Samanids and that of other petty courts of the east, Iranian literature flourished, reaching an extraordinary stage of maturity and eloquence with authors such as Rūdakī, Daqīqī and al-Kisāʾī of Marw 14 It was at this time that the ancient Iranian epic traditions were rekindled, and in 346/957 the governor of Ṭūs in Khurasan, Abū Manṣūr Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Razzāq, commissioned the translation of Pahlawī (that is, the Middle Persian of the Sasanians) texts of the national epic into New Persian These were taken up by the great poet Abu ’l-Qāsim Firdawsī of Ṭūs (c 329–30/ 940–1–c 411/1020 or 416/1025), author of the monumental versified epic retelling of the history of the pre-Islamic Iranian kings and heroes
Ctesiphon), placed the ʿAbbasids (132/750656/1258) in the heartlands of the former Sasanian empire (c. 224–651) During Sasanian times scholarly activity was partly motivated by a Zoroastrian imperial ideology that would see all learning ultimately derive from the Avestan texts, the Zoroastrian canonical scriptures It is perhaps in this context that the burgeoning Graeco-Persian translation activities which culminated in the reign of Khusraw I Anūshirwān (r 531–578), generating a culture of translation that survived into early ʿAbbasid times, are best understood 8 Political and economic support from the Western Central Asian world, in particular from greater Khurasan (in other words the wider Iranian world), was indispensable for the ʿAbbasid victory 9 The early ʿAbbasid caliphs tried to legitimise their rule by expanding their ideology to include the concerns of the “Persian” contingent, thereby bringing about the incorporation of Sasanian culture, still dominant for large parts of the population east of Iraq, into mainstream ʿAbbasid culture 10 Two components of the Sasanian culture, Zoroastrian imperial ideology and political astrology, proved to be of immense significance to the caliph al-Manṣūr, who was in many ways the actual founder of the ʿAbbasid caliphate, in helping him to consolidate the ʿAbbasid cause Between the second half of the eighth and eleventh centuries, intense scientific activity was accompanied by a prodigious effort to garner and then translate, assimilate and cultivate scientific and pseudo-scientific treatises, for instance on theology, medicine, astrology and logic, mostly via Syriac and Persian (Pahlawī) into the Arabic sphere Especially in the field of astronomy and astrology translations were often also made from Persian or Sanskrit 11 The translation movement was actively patronised by the ʿAbbasid rulers while at the same time representing a “social phenomenon” which was “subsidized by an enormous outlay of funds, both public and private ”12 Support for these undertakings “cut across all lines of religious, sectarian, ethnic, tribal and linguistic demarcation Patrons were Arabs and non-Arabs, Muslims and non-Muslims, Sunnīs and Shīʿites, generals and civilians, merchants and land-owners, etc ”13 While the most widely known evidence for Muslim cultural borrowing lies in this vast

At the same time there was a florescence of local arts and crafts With this cultural background, some of the Turkic tribes, in particular the Oghuz and Qarluq (henceforth known as Türkmen/Turkoman),16 converted to Islam and became heirs to the local Muslim civilisations, Iranian and then Arabic By the late tenth century Selchük (transcribed in Arabic as Saljūq), the son of Toqaq Temir yaligh, commander of the Oghuz yabghu, embraced Islam and became a ghāzī (Muslim warrior for the faith) against his still pagan fellow-tribesmen He and his followers soon became embroiled in a power struggle with the weakening Samanids, a vacuum filled shortly after by the emerging Turkic dynasties, the Ghaznawids and Qarakhanids, thus setting the stage for the rise of the Great Saljuq Empire Turkic tribes had long been in contact with Western Central Asian culture The Ghaznavid dynasty of Turkish origin was founded by Sebüktigin, a general and governor for the Samanids and with its capital in Ghazna lasted for over two hundred years, from 367/977–8 to 583/1187 The Ghaznawids were favourably disposed towards Iranian culture, and their courts became outstanding cultural centres They thus fulfilled what was expected of royal patrons, as the polymath of the age, Abu ’l-Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Bīrūnī, who finished his days at Ghazna, put it: “to do this [sc to honour learning and its representatives is] ... the duty of those who rule over them, of kings and princes For they alone can free the minds of scholars from the daily anxieties for the necessities of life, and stimulate their energies to earn more fame and favour, the yearning for which is the pith and marrow of human nature ”17 The Indian campaigns of Maḥmūd ibn Sebüktigin (r 389/999–421/1030) brought a great influx of plundered temple treasures into the capital, Ghazna The empire reached its zenith under Maḥmūd: no expense was spared in beautifying the capital and the sulṭān brought scholars, craftsmen and artisans from the lands he had conquered to Ghazna as well as to such provincial centres as Herat, Balkh and Lashkarī Bāzār, resulting in a flowering of the arts, and of architecture in particular 18
from mythico-legendary times until the arrival of Islam, which in the context of the period may be seen in terms of an Iranian revival characterised by an interest in national history Known as the Shāh-nāma, it was completed in 400/1010 after about thirty years of writing Together with Asadī Ṭūsī’s (d c 465/1072) slightly later heroic epic Garshāsp-nāma (“Epic of Garshāsp”), the oldest of the epics complementary to Firdawsī’s Shāh-nāma, it serves as one of the main sources for various descriptions of dragons comprising the following range of features that not only incorporate characteristics of various species into a single body but had the ability to cross boundaries within the natural environment it inhabits and was found in different locations:
[The dragon] is sometimes described as a wolf, a tiger, shīr-e kappī, i e , a sort of sphinx (combined lion and ape), or simply as a patyāra (maleficent creature), or a black cloud it has one head and mouth, exhaling fire and smoke from its hellish mouth, and inhaling with enough force to suck in a horse and rider, or a crocodile from the water, or an eagle from the sky ... It is big as a mountain Its head resembles a thicket of hair and its bristles stretch down to the ground like nooses It has two horns the size of the branch of a tree, ten gaz or eighty cubits long Its eyes are the size of wagon wheels or like two tanks of blood They shine from afar as brightly as stars at night, as two glittering diamonds, as two blazing torches, or as two mirrors held beneath the sun It has two tusks, each the length of the hero’s arm or of a stag’s horns Humans and animals hang from its teeth When it sticks its long, black tongue out of its mouth it hangs down onto the road like a black tree Its skin has scales like a fish, each as big as a shield It has eight feet, though most often it drags itself over the ground, and when it moves it makes the valleys and plains tremble, and a river of yellow poison as deep as a spear flows from its tail and nose Its color is variously described, e g , as dark yellow or gray, black, blue Its lair, guarded day and night, is on a mountain (usually said to be near the sea, whence the azhdahā itself originated) or rock the same color as its body and is shunned by all living things, animals and plants The sources variously locate it on the Kashaf-rūd near Ṭūs, on Mount Shekāwand in Kabul, India, “Māzandarān,” on

Although Firdawsī makes the Oxus the traditional boundary between Iran and Tūrān (the Central Asian region beyond the Jayḥūn/Āmū Daryā), the land of the nomadic world of Western Central Asia, and states that there was a natural dislike between the two groups, which were like “two elements, fire and water, which rage against each other in the depths of the heart,”19 there was never, as Bosworth has pointed out, a cut and dried distinction between the two racial groups 20 They had a long history of interaction and the Turkish people were well-known to the Iranians, who had often been invaded by steppe peoples of diverse ethnic origins The antithesis between Iran and Tūrān, emblematising a dualistic conception of the world and of history, thus appears by Firdawsī’s time to have been more a literary and archaising preconception of the Iranian national consciousness than a reflection of the actual state of affairs 21 The Qarakhanid Muslim philologist, Maḥmūd al-Kāshgharī, remarks in his lexicographic encyclopaedia Dīwān lughāt al-turk, written in 463/1071, that all of Transoxania, which was closely linked with the Eurasian steppe, was once inhabited by Turkic peoples, “but when the Iranians (al-Furs) became numerous, it became just like Persian territory (bilād al-ʿAjam) ”22 Thus the two worlds had to a large part become intermingled culturally as well as ethnically The westward migration of ever-growing numbers of Turkic-speaking tribes, the dominant force being the Saljuqs, into Western Asia increased from the late tenth century onwards This accelerated following their decisive victory under Ṭoghrıl Beg over the Ghaznawids at Dandāndaqān (located between Marw and Sarakhs) in 431/1040, after which all of Iran lay open before them In

(Allen, 1932, pp 91–2) The ruler of Erzurum ordered his son, Mughīth al-Dīn Toghrıl, to convert to Christianity to marry Rusudan (1223–1247), the daughter of queen Tʿamar of Georgia, and heir to the throne after the sudden death of her brother, whose daughter was in turn married to the Saljuq sulṭān of Rūm, Giyāth al-Dīn Kay Khusraw II (634/1237–644/1246); after his death she married the Parwāna Muḥammad ibn Sulaymān Muʿīn al-Dīn (executed in 676/1277), one of the most powerful Anatolian magnates of the thirteenth century Cf Minorsky, 1953, p 135; Melikian-Chirvani, 1974, p 113, n 17; Rogers, 1976, p 316 34 The eleventh-century ruler of Dwīn, Abu ’l-Aswār Shawūr, of the minor Armenian dynasty of the Shaddādids, was married to a sister of the Armenian king of Tashir, David Anholin Akhsatān ibn Manuchihr ibn Afrīdūn, ruler of Ani, and son of this princess, also married an Armenian princess of the Bagratid house (Minorsky, 1953, p 81) See also Melikian-Chirvani, 1974, p 113, n 17 35 For instance the close similarities between the eleventhcentury narrative poem, Wīs u Ramīn, and Shota Rustaveli’s twelfth-century epic Vepkhis-tkaosani (“The Knight in the Panther’s Skin”); see idem, 1974, p 112 and n 14 36 See, for instance, a Georgian astrological treatise of 1188, illustrated under Islamic influence which MelikianChirvani (1974, pp 112–3 and n 15) interpretes as Persian, detecting Khurasanian influence in the Kufic inscriptions Amiranašvili, 1966, pls 56–66 and pp 28–30, where the writer also connects the Iranian stylistic influence with the Persianising aspect in Georgian literature 37 Melikian-Chirvani, 1974, p 113 and n 16

“When the dust arose from the countless army, the cheeks of our worthies turned pale As for me I raised the mace that kills with a single blow and felled that host upon the spot I uttered a yell from my saddle saying, ‘The earth has become a millstone upon them ’”

rapid increase of small principalities founded by atābegs/atābaks (“father-beys”) or various members of the Saljuq dynasty resulted in the establishment of numerous courts, all competing with each other for cultural prestige, which may well have provided the impetus for the proliferation of innovative images However, this was severely disrupted under the impact of invasions from the east, first by the Turkic Khwārazm shāhs in the 1220s and shortly after by the Mongols, which brought about a cataclysm with great social upheavals, destruction and discontinuity After the battle of Köse Dagh in the region of Sivas (Sebasteia) in 641/1243, the Mongols occupied Anatolia and Saljuq autonomy was lost forever For a time the Saljuq sultanate continued as a Mongol province, although some Türkmen emirs maintained small principalities of their own in distant mountainous districts, but finally the Saljuq dynasty came to its end
sweeping socio-political, economic and artistic changes that made “northern Mesopotamia” a geographical entity known in medieval Islam as the Jazīra (“island”), the northern part of the territory located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (today divided between eastern Syria, northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey) – “one of the liveliest regions ”38 Political stability, though not hegemony, brought about relative prosperity Following the decline of the Great Saljuq dynasty from around 512/1118, the area was divided into a number of Turkish and Kurdish principalities 39 The Saljuq “successor states” included the Artuqids of Amīda/Diyārbakr (end of the fifth/ eleventh to the beginning of the ninth/fifteenth century), the Zangids of northern Syria (5212/1127–8 until 579/1183 in Aleppo and until 631/1233 in Mosul), the Ayyubids of Syria and Egypt (564/1169–658/1260) and the Saljuqs of Rūm (Anatolia, c. 483/1081–c 707/1307) The

to its availability as well as the local builders’ mastery of stone masonry, a skill which was naturally made use of by their new rulers, the Saljuqs The subjugated local population was largely Christian, who only gradually converted to the faith of their rulers, and not only employed their traditions of stone-carving, woodwork, stucco and tile-mosaic but also their decorative repertoire 5 It is evident that dragon motifs were not limited to Islamic monuments or portable objects, but were used equally by Christian artists and the artists of other faiths The iconography of the dragon clearly enjoyed cross-cultural popularity in the medieval era In fact representations of the motif on stone-carved architectural reliefs in the predominantly Christian Transcaucasian realm (that is most of present-day Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijian) precede its first known depictions in neighbouring eleventh- and twelfth-century northern Mesopotamia, Syria and Anatolia In particular in the Armenian and Georgian regions this type of imagery can be found from about the ninth century onwards, especially the dragon combat motif (the earliest depictions of which may be datable to the seventh century), which will be examined in chapter 7 Often depicted in mirror image, dragon themes appear above or around entrances and portals which represent the boundary between the exterior and interior The placement reflects the sensitivity of the threshold (Lat limen) as both a metaphor for the monument it protects and the
Carved friezes or high-relief sculpture on stonework of the medieval Islamic period, very often figural in nature and including a repertory of animals and fabulous beasts, were portrayed in particular on architectural monuments These could include the gates, archivolts and doorways of secular monuments such as city walls, palaces and caravanserais, as well as religious monuments like mosques, madrasas and funerary structures Among the mythical creatures depicted on medieval Islamic monuments, the dragon occupies a significant place 1 However, while the iconography is entirely absent from Western Central Asian monumental art until the fifteenth century,2 it is characteristic of the area to the west of Iran As noted earlier, this is due to the fact that no figural sculpture is associated with the brick architecture of the Iranian world from about 1000 to 1200, whereas the dragon motif is conspicuous on portable items from the greater Khurasan region, where the motif has a very ancient history Its appearance on the architecture of eleventh- and twelfth-century northern Mesopotamia, the Jazīra, Syria and Anatolia,3 may on the one hand be due to depictions in the so-called “minor arts” whose very nature is their potential for portability, allowing for the long-distance diffusion of motifs 4 This may be compounded by another reason which may be sought locally The principal building material employed for the architecture of these regions is cut-stone with brick playing a minor role The preference for this material is due

about poisonous snakes whose looks alone are enough to kill, see Ullmann, 1992, p 111; Ruska, “Almās,” EI1 I, p 313; Ruska and Plessner, “Almās,” EI2 I, 419a The poisonous serpent or basilisk whose glance could kill a man was already known in antiquity (cf Pliny, Naturalis Historia VII 1 2 and 49 70; VIII 33) 11 Al-Masʿūdī, Kitāb murūj al-dhahab, tr and ed Barbier de Meynard and de Courteille, 1917, vol 2, pp 425–7 See also Pseudo-Callisthenes, Historia Alexandri Magni, ed Kroll, 1926, p 32 The story is also recorded by Ibn Khaldūn who discounts the practical aspect of it and observes “the story of the many heads they have is intended to indicate ugliness and frightfulness It is not meant to be taken literally” Muqaddima, tr Rosenthal, 1958, vol 1, p 73
liminal or transitory realm within which the passage from the perilous exterior to the secure interior might be negotiated 6 The doorway, gates and further openings, or other vulnerable zones, were considered to be a favourite abode of dangerous spirits, hence the particular precautions, rites of spatial passage and apotropaic sacrifices enacted in these areas on special occasions 7 One of the primary uses of the iconography of the dragon was therefore to identify the threshold and thereby operate as liminal marker The choice of the dragon in this capacity reflects a consistently followed principle according to which anyone entering a building is confronted by the dragon figure While the dragon’s intermediate position and hybrid character itself is marked out as incarnate liminality, characterised by ambiguity, its fierce, menacing aspect is here found in a “helpful” context in that it is directed towards the outside world, warding off all hostile attack, and turning into a symbolism of defence of those that are “inside ” It is employed in its apotropaic capacity to ward off evil and afford protection by taking a defensive role against baleful creatures and dangerous influences such as natural catastrophes Its semantic horizon is thereby extended to include the function of guardian of the threshold akin to a “tutelary spirit” imbued with prophylactic and talismanic power 8 The apotropaic and protective function of the dragon may further be associated with belief in the Evil Eye, the blighting glance of envy, which belongs to one of the most ancient concepts of humanity, prevalent in medieval Islamic culture and referred to in the Qurʾān (sūra 68, 51–3) 9 The Evil Eye was feared and apotropaic symbolism, sometimes in the form of fixed representations of the Eye attached to architectural structures, was used to ward off its malevolent gaze, to disseminate evil and to warrant protection It may further be noted that the Evil Eye was often considered
to be most harmful to those in the liminal stages of life, such as newborn children, the newly married or pregnant women Moreover, in keeping with ideas relating to the protection of deceased individuals entering the liminal and transitional states, burials are sensitive sites At funerary sites and mausolea, the dragons serve as markers of sacred spaces The depiction of dragons may be associated with the fact that some dangerous animals, in particular vipers, are held to have a poisonous glance 10 This is illustrated by the story of the marine dragons reported by the renowned tenth-century Arab geographer and traveller, Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī al-Masʿūdī (d 345/956) Marine creatures are said to have so frightened the workmen who built Alexandria as to prevent Iskandar (Alexander the Great) from constructing the city He is therefore said to have dived into the sea in a glass box inserted into a wooden box from where he drew pictures of the sea monsters These images were used to construct metal effigies which were then set up opposite the place where building was being carried out When the dragons emerged from the sea and saw the images they fled, enabling Iskandar to complete the building of Alexandria 11 This ruse was hence linked to the idea that if confronted by representations of themselves, dragons would be repelled by their own noxious power The account has a precedent in the biblical story of the plague of poisonous snakes which so devastated the people of Israel that Moses intervened on their behalf, setting a bronze image of a serpent upon a pole (Numbers 21:6, 7 and 9):
The Lord sent seraph serpents against the people They bit the people and many of the Israelites died The people came to Moses and said, “we sinned, by speaking against the Lord and against you Intercede with the Lord to take away the

well-being; it also relates to architectural sculptures that served an apotropaic function 15 The text is included in Ibn Rusteh’s early tenth-century geographical work, Kitāb al-aʿlāq al-nafīsa See El-Cheikh, 2004, p 148

serpents from us!” And Moses interceded for the people Then the Lord said to Moses, “Make a seraph figure and mount it on a standard And if anyone who is bitten looks at it, he shall recover ” Moses made a copper serpent and mounted it on a standard; and when anyone was bitten by a serpent, he would look at the copper serpent and recover 12
The expedient relates to the magical principle of effecting a cure for snake venom by viewing the image of the serpent, thus following the principle of homeopathic (or imitative) magic, similia similibus, according to which things are believed to act upon each other, even at a distance, if they are alike in some relevant manner The purpose of the bronze image was therefore therapeutic: anyone bitten by a serpent could be healed by looking at it Since the peril was identified with the demonic power within the serpent, the bronze image upon a pole constituted a counter-equivalent power which served as effective prophylaxis The famous copper alloy serpent column, the triple-headed serpent tripod of Delphi in the Hippodrome of the city of Constantinople, is an example of apotropaic sculpture intended to afford protection from poisonous creatures, including serpents 13 The early tenth-century Arab captive, Hārūn ibn yaḥyā, notes four copper serpents in Constantinople that served as talismans14 to render noxious creatures inoffensive 15 The sixteenth-century Ottoman historian Aḥmad ibn yūsuf al-Qaramānī (d 1019/1610) similarly reports:
Serpents and snakes appeared in [Constantinople] and decimated men and cattle alike Those who
survived fled, and it remained empty for a while Then, to drive these calamities away, one sultan [Byzantine emperor] fabricated a talisman, possibly the bronze one now presently shaped like three serpents 16
ʿIzz al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Shaddād (613/1217684/1285), the chronicler of the cities of Syria and the Jazīra in the thirteenth century, mentions a dragon tower (burj al-thaʿābīn) in Aleppo that was supposed not only to prevent the detrimental effects of snake-bites but also to protect the city’s inhabitants 17 The late Mamluk topographer Abu ’l-Faḍl Muḥammad Ibn al-Shiḥna (active 14001450) more clearly specifies that the tower referred to as burj al-thaʿābīn serves as a talisman against serpents conferring immunity from snake bite in Aleppo 18 Such apotropaic renditions were not unique to Islamic architecture but were also found in the Christian environment This is evidenced by the twelfth-century ascetic Abu ’l-Ḥāsan ʿAlī ibn Abī Bakr al-Harawī (d 611/1215), who in his description of sacred sites of Anatolia describes a talismanic design of a double-headed serpent in the church of Mart [sic; perhaps a corruption of Mār] Dāris in Mayyāfāriqīn, northeast of Diyārbakr 19 The conception of the existence of a serpent with heads at both ends of its body appears to have been widespread in the medieval Islamic world It is discussed in the best-known book on animals of the Arab world, the Kitāb al-Ḥayawān (“Book of Animals”), written by the ninth-century littérateur Abū ʿUthmān ʿAmr ibn Baḥr, known by his nickname al-Jāḥiẓ (“the google-eyed”; 159/775–6–255/868–9) He quotes the Arabic

translation or paraphrase of the Aristotelian Historia Animalium and, while duly noting his personal scepticism as an educated man, records the following anecdote:
The Master of Logic (Aristotle) states that a serpent with two heads was observed I asked a bedouin about that, and he asserted that it be [sic] true Whereupon I said to him: In the direction of which one of the two heads does it creep, and with which one does it eat and bite? He replied: As to its creeping it does not creep (at all), but proceeds towards its aim by rolling itself as do boys on the sand As to its eating it takes its evening meal with one mouth and its breakfast with the other As to its biting it does so with both its heads 20
Depictions of double-headed serpents, or amphisbaena, are a recurrent feature on architecture, most often positioned above gates, as will be shown in the following Many city gates also carried prominent epigraphic panels commemorating a victory, invoking good fortune or deflecting evil influences 21 Qurʾānic verses in particular are considered the most powerful of all “talismans ”22 Often these protective inscriptions were complemented or replaced by images of the dragon which served a prophylactic and talismanic (in the sense of apotropaic) function It was thus their purpose to protect, avert the power of evil, and to promote well-being In 579/1183–4 Diyārbakr (Diyarbakır), the historic city of Āmid, was conquered by the Türkmen Artuqids who in the same year made significant additions to the striking black basalt city walls to commemorate the victory 23 A large frieze graces the West Gate (the former Rūm Gate and present Urfa Gate) and eulogises the patron Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Qara Arslan ibn Dāwūd ibn Suqmān (561/1166–581/1185) with extensive titles and Qurʾānic verses (sūras 48, 18; and 61, 13) which were deemed to have specific powers relating to the attaining of victory: “Help comes from God and victory is near ”24 The protective power of the inscription is augmented by carved reliefs: a pair of symmetrical confronted dragons with forelegs is surmounted by the composition of a bird of prey, probably an eagle, wings out
stretched, and standing atop the horns of a bull’s head, the nose of which is threaded through with a large copper alloy ring carved onto the keystone of the arched gate The dragons are rendered in formal pose with one foreleg raised (sometimes considered to be “heraldic”), their elongated twisting serpentine tail arranged first in a socalled pretzel-like (or heart-shaped) knot and then into two loops; their supernatural properties are represented by the presence of wings and by the long sinuous tongues protruding from the open mouths (fig 1) 25 These details which represent a “heraldic” stylisation of the creature establish not only the symbolism of the Saljuq-period dragon but indicate at the same time a ceremonial and ritual of subjugation and domestication However in contrast to some of the later Saljuqperiod dragon sculpture, discussed below, that was intended to be highly visible from far away, the Diyārbakr dragon reliefs, which represent the earliest surviving such examples of the medieval Islamic period, are rather discreetly portrayed: they are too small to be detected from a distance and thus remain curiously invisible It may be hypothesised that the inconspicuous nature of the depictions reflects a formative level of the conceptualisation; hence, the craftsmen were still rather unfamiliar with the dragon iconography and thus perhaps did not wish to display it too ostentatiously yet the fluidly rendered portrayal, which is in line with later distinctive representations when the motif had become increasingly common, betrays this assumption Indeed it may be noted that, with exceptions such as the Konya dragon sculptures discussed below, the iconic image of the dragon was generally not conspicuously displayed throughout the medieval period This may be due to the fact that size and associated visibility were not considered to be essential criteria for the inherently propitious and apotropaic powers of the sculptures to take effect 26 Related but much larger, plastically carved decoration was characteristic of the early thirteenth-century city walls, gates or citadel of the Saljuq capital Konya (ancient Iconium) in central Anatolia, built by sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I (r 616/1219–634/1237) to protect the city from

the Mongol advance A group of double-headed dragon reliefs from these now destroyed monuments is preserved in the İnce Minare Müzesi, Konya 27 Iconographic and stylistic variations certainly exist between the dragon sculptures of this period, but the basic conception remains the same for all surviving examples Akin to the Artuqid Diyārbakr dragon reliefs the Konya sculptures are thus similarly portrayed with their inner forelegs raised, the “Saljuq-style” heads with cusped pricked up ears projecting at the top, the wide-open jaws terminating in upward curled tips revealing sharp teeth and the tongues thrust out to reveal bifid tips The upswept, curved wings with tightly curled tips project from the haunches; their serpentine tails are knotted at mid-section In these fragments however the tails curve backwards and then taper to a small dragon head that snaps with its snout at the dragon-tail (fig 60) Although preserved as individual panels, the dragons would probably have been represented as antithetical pairs 28 In contrast to the shallowly rendered Diyārbakr dragon reliefs, these dragons are plastically sculpted, the monumentality of their size adding to their visually dramatic appearance The large stone panels may have been placed on or near the city gates and would have made an impressive sight on the city wall, visible from afar The chronicler of the history of the Rūm Saljuqids, al-Ḥusayn ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Jaʿfarī al-Rughadī, known as Ibn al-Bībī (d after 684/ December 1285), who was head of the chancellery of the Secretariat of State,29 describes the elaborate royal ceremonies the Saljuqs were known to have staged at the city gates where they received visitors before conducting them into the city 30 The placement of several dragon sculptures on the city walls and gates would have amplified the
impression of power and good fortune which the sculptures were probably meant to convey Closely related dragon figures are known from the interior decoration of Saljuq palaces Two small fragments have been discovered at the now destroyed palace-citadel at Kubadabad on the west bank of Lake Beyşehir, near Akşehir, of the sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I (r 616/1219–634/1237), whose reign marked the height of Rūm Saljuq power One of these is a fragmentary stone relief-carved with a dragon’s head,31 the other is a star tile showing paired dragons whose necks cross over and whose wideopen confronted jaws reveal rows of pointed teeth and bifid tongues 32 A third piece was discovered while excavating the ruins of the pavilion (köshk) on Konya’s citadel, which was probably built during the reign of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān Rukn al-Dīn Qılıch Arslan IV (r 646/1248–647/1249, 655/1257–664/1266) 33 It represents a plaster fragment moulded in low relief with a pair of related addorsed dragons separated by a braided band; their gaping snouts are turned backwards, the feathery wings raised, and the tails form a pretzel-like knot and a loop before tapering to a point 34 One of the most outstanding examples of the dragon iconography on city gates certainly must have been the monumental sculptures on the archivolt of the so-called Talisman Gate (Bāb al- Ṭilasm) in Baghdad (figs 2, 139a and b) which was destroyed in 1917 during the First World War 35 As indicated by the name of the gate, built in 618/1221–2 under the great caliph Abu l-ʿAbbās Aḥmad al-Nāṣir li-Dīn Allāh (577/1181620/1223), this type of imagery had talismanic (as also implied by the gate’s name), or at least apotropaic connotations It showed a seated figure

that presumably represented the caliph in the act of subduing a pair of mighty confronted dragons whose expansive serpentine bodies entirely filled the rest of the archivolt The monumental sculptures, moreover, are not only to be seen as images of power, for the added symbolism of the central figure contributes an important authoritative component as will be considered in chapter 6 A pair of monumental intertwined doubleheaded dragons guards one of the monumental entrance gates to the citadel of Aleppo, which was legendary for its impregnability 36 The large relief-carved frieze with the interlaced dragons surmounts a pointed archivolt with a raised frame at the main portal known as Serpent Gate (Bāb al-Ḥayyāt, re-built probably around 606/120910)37 at the eastern tower of the citadel rebuilt under the Ayyubid ruler al-Malik al-Ẓāhir ibn Salāḥ al-Dīn (568/1173–613/1216) The two heads, one at the springing of the arch and the other at the apex, are crowned by a pair of cusped ears and punctuated with small round eyes; their pointed snouts reveal a row of prominent pointed teeth with bifid tongues thrusting out Scaly rufflike collars from which project what appear to be tiny, upswept, cusped wings accentuate the base of the necks and delineate the bodies Their slender, serpentine bodies are thrice knotted on either side into evenly spaced, pretzel-like shapes The entwined necks at the apex result in an addorsed position of the dragon heads that with wide-open jaws appear to grasp or attack their bodies; this is mirrored in the lower necks and heads of the dragons at the tail tips that are twisted around roundels enclosing eight-pointed star-rosettes (figs 3a and b),38 which Willy Hartner has interpreted as solar symbols 39 Astrological symbolism may however be but one component of the commanding composition which in its fantastic, fierce, and awe-inspiring aspect, as yasser Tabbaa points out, exudes above all also a symbolism of power 40 What is more, the motif serves to strengthen the belief in the impregnability and inviolability of the citadel and to function as a powerful protective device Added
to the talismanic aspect is the potent symbolism of the mysterious interlace of the dragons41 and the knotting of their bodies, a conspicuous feature on many depictions of the dragon, as discussed below in chapter 10 Significant relations between the Islamic world and the Caucasus region, in particular Armenia, were established in early ʿAbbasid times Later on, with the Saljuq conquests of the eastern Anatolian region, the Armenian iconographic repertoire served as a source of inspiration, and reciprocal contacts between the Saljuqs and the cultural sphere of the Caucasus were established 42 The close geographic proximity led furthermore to a natural sharing of iconographic emblems After the Saljuq raids that led to the capture of Ani, the ancient Armenian capital, near Kars, in 456/1064, the city continued to flourish under the Kurdish Shaddādid emirs who subsequently bought the city from the Saljuqs in 464/1072 During the Shaddādid period, as a result of the Byzantine and Muslim wars which led to the interruption of direct trade, Ani became an intermediary of the trade between Iraq and the Black Sea and thus developed into an important and wealthy trading centre 43 The long stylised bodies of a pair of dragons horizontally circumscribe two round towers (nos 46 and 62) of the northern city wall of Ani Their bodies are rendered in the form of a thick diagonally hatched moulding, resembling a twisted rope, and end in large heads in profile with gaping mouths revealing rows of teeth and tongues with bifid tips that flank a frontally rendered bovine head which in one case holds a ring in its mouth (fig 130) 44 The Shaddādids of Ani (c 464/1072595/1198–9 with interruptions) ordered work on the walls, though the reliefs may equally well have been added when the Shaddādid Abū Shudjāʿ Minūchihr ibn Abi ’l-Aswār Shāwur (d c. 512/ 1118) was governing the city 45 In the same vein as ʿIzz al-Dīn Ibn Shaddād’s thirteenth-century elucidation of serpent imagery on a tower in Aleppo which was meant not only to prevent the detrimental effects of snake-bites but also to protect the

city’s inhabitants,46 the two paired dragon sculptures probably served as powerful protection for the citizens of Ani The added potency conveyed by the symbolism of the dragons flanking a bull’s head is examined in chapter 7 The dragons’ sculpted representations on the Ani towers however show that their symbolism was not restricted to just one religious creed, as Muslims and Christians alike made use of the iconography One of the most striking features of Anatolian Saljuq architecture is the chain of caravanserais (khāns) that link the principal cities of the Sultanate of Rūm Their prime function was evidently to service the north-south overland trade, in other words to provide for and protect travelling merchants However, as Michael Rogers has pointed out, the east-west trade was much less developed and in spite of the increasingly difficult terrain, the density of distribution of caravanserais east of Sivas noticeably decreases Nonetheless, to facilitate trade along the Araxes, the local Georgian dynasty built their own chain of caravanserais, which appears to have been modelled on the Saljuq system 47 The depiction of the dragons on the khāns afforded further protection for travellers and caravans from any evil such as raids A pair of monumental antithetical dragons are depicted on a deeply carved relief band at the back of the entrance īwān at Karatay Han on the former trade road linking Kayseri with Malatya According to the epigraphic frieze above the main door, the khān was built during the reign of sulṭān Ghiyāth al-Dīn Kay Khusraw II, son of ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I, in 638/1240–1 48 The expansive serpentine bodies, entirely stylised by three parallel moulded bands, are formed of a horizontal guilloche band which extends to frame the entire arch and interlaces at the apex to form a central circular motif, presumably alluding to stellar symbolism, as will be further discussed below Tongues with bifid tips touch the edges of the central motif, projecting from the toothed jaws of the substantial dragon heads which are finely carved in profile with slightly gaping long wrinkled snouts, the tips
terminating in a tight curl The heads have small, almond-shaped eyes and the cheeks are enlivened by fine spiralling motifs A pair of cusped ears crowns the heads; the mane is swept back and covers the uppermost section of the finely carved scaly neck (figs 4a and b) 49 The same khān includes a spring housed in a türbe-like building that is circumscribed by an elaborate muqarnas frieze, comprising a menagerie of fifteen animals among which is the atypical depiction of a single dragon 50 Unusually, the dragon’s body forms not only a pretzel-like knot just below the neck but the very long serpentine tail is knotted to form a maze of interlace (fig 5) The dragon’s hide is covered allover with a spotted pattern Its head with wide-open mouth is turned backwards towards a bird perched in an adjacent niche that holds a round object in its beak It may be reasonable to propose that the accumulation of knotted interlace in the dragon’s tail symbolised an increase in the protection against evil influences The resulting maze probably denoted the ability to resist disentanglement by Evil Eyes and may have been considered as added potency At the same time the complex tangle ensured that the innate forces of the dragon itself are also securely bound in the maze of its own making Katharina Otto-Dorn, followed by Gönül Öney, associates the reliefs with the twelve animal cycle,51 a view which has been challenged by Jean-Paul Roux on the basis that the discrepancy between the animals depicted on the frieze and the animals associated with the twelve animal cycle is too great 52 At the now partly destroyed thirteenth-century caravanserai, Susuz Han (Susuz Khān), dated c 644/1246,53 located about one kilometre south of Bucak just off the Burdur-Antalya road, the ogives of a pair of recessed muqarnas niches that flank the portal are each surmounted by a pair of antithetically presented dragons in profile The heads of the mythical creatures are crowned by curved horns, they have elongated wide-open snouts ending in curled-up tips, the sinuous necks are covered with scales and from the protomes project curved wings and short forelegs At the

54 It is noteworthy that in addition to the contemporary carved decoration one also finds the reuse of late antique and Byzantine architectural elements at the khān which includes an example of a section of a lintel carved with a vegetal frieze enlivened with small human faces projecting from the recesses; documented during the author’s visit in October 2008 55 Riefstahl, 1931, p 67, pl 125; Kühnel, 1950, p 8; Gierlichs, 1996, pp 95, 162–4, pl 11 1–2 56 The motif recalls the winged figures or angels, generally referred to as Nike (Victory) or Tyche (Fortuna), depicted on the sides of the now destroyed Larenda Gate of Konya (Texier, 1862; Sarre, 1910, pl CIX, and idem, 1936, pp 8–9, figs 3, 4; cf the bas-relief of winged figures of c 617/1220, now preserved in the İnce Minare Müzesi, Konya, inv nos 883, 884) and may also be compared to the victoriae set into the spandrels of the monumental rock-cut arch at Tāq-i Bustān built by Khusraw II Parwīz (590–628), or the early Christian motif derived from the Roman composition of the imago clipeata held by winged figures (cf L’Orange, 1953, pp 90–102); for instance, the flying figures holding aloft a cross within a wreath rendered on the south façade of the seventh-century church of Ptghni (Ptghavankʿ), Ararat (Thierry, 1987, p 365, fig 199); or on the façade of the church of Dshwari of Mzcheta, built between 586–7 and 604–5 (Baltrušaitis, 1929, pl LXXVI, fig 125) The motif can also be observed on portable objects such as the sixth-century Byzantine ivory bindings of the Ejmiatsin Gospels (Der Nersessian, 2001, p 155, cat no 77) Cf Redford, 1993, pp 153–5 According to Christian church doctrine the souls of the faithful were car
ried to heaven by angels who guarded them from dangers on the way The need to curb the cult of angel veneration as it appeared increasingly idolatrous is reflected in the canons of the council of Laodicea (c 363–364) Protective imagery of this type occurs at entry points of Transcaucasian churches On each side of the central window of the sixth- to eighth-century church at Ōdzun, for instance, an angel holds what appears to be the coiling tail of a serpent and the serpents’ bodies intertwine to form a knot at the apex (however on account of the advanced surface deterioration the composition is unfortunately difficult to assess; cf Redgate, 2000, p 126); a similar serpent knot surmounts the window of the south portal at the seventh-century church of Mren (c 640) 57 Öney, 1969a, p 199, figs 15 a (line drawing) and b (photograph); Gierlichs, 1996, pl 11 3–4 58 Öney, 1969a, pp 184, 207–8, fig 31; İnal, p 160, fig 12; Gierlichs (1996, pp 171–2, pl 17 6) suggests that the relief carving might be a spolia When the author visited the khān in 2008, it had just been renovated and the relief with the bovine head between two dragons, which previously had been in very weathered condition, no longer existed 59 Erdmann, 1961, p 77 60 Minorsky, 1953, pp 104–5 61 Rogers, 1976, pp 322–6, and idem, “Saldjūḳids,” EI2 VIII, 936a 62 Golden, 1983, p 66 63 Minorsky, 1953, p 102 64 Idem, p 103 Cf Barthold [Minorsky], “Ānī,” EI2 I, 507a
apex the confronted dragon mouths flank a small, rounded human head with clearly demarcated eyes, ears, nose and mouth (figs 7 and 124, detail of one muqarnas niche) 54 The dragons’ stylised festooned tail, which echoes the contemporary festoon on the arches of the “Kiosk Mosque” at Sultan Han (discussed below), frames the entire arch (without however ending in a second head at the tail tip as shown on the south-facing ogive arch at Sultan Han) 55 The composition is further distinguished by a pair of winged figures flanking a central now destroyed motif that seem to hover protectively over the composition and can be assumed to have celestial significance 56 Their presence seems to bestow a honorific dimension upon the enigmatic iconography of the mask-like human heads tightly enclosed by the dragons’ gaping jaws, a feature examined further in chapter 7 The dragon occurs once more on the caravanserai but as a single depiction (fig 6) Set within the tight angular interlacing strapwork to the right side of the façade of Susuz Han is the small figure of a single dragon entwined in a pretzel-like knot, its re-curving tail end passing through the knot, which additionally contains, lower down, another depiction of a human face and rosettes 57 An interesting composition involving the dragon occurs on the façade above a window on Kesikköprü Han situated on the Kırşehir-Kayseri Road to the south of Kırşehir in central Anatolia
It shows a frontally rendered projecting bovine head from the mouth of which springs a pair of addorsed dragons, with upward arching and once looped or knotted necks, their wide-open jaws oriented to the top 58 An inscription dates the khān to 667/1268–9 and names Jibrāʾīl ibn Chāchā, vizier and governor of Kırşehir under sulṭān Ghiyāth al-Dīn Kai Khusraw III (664/1266–680/1281), as its patron 59 As mentioned earlier, Ani, the ancient Armenian capital, had become an important and wealthy trading centre during the Shaddādid period 60 In 1124, under David II, Ani was conquered by the Georgians who built their own chain of caravanserais 61 David II laid the foundation for the power of the Georgian pan-Transcaucasian monarchy (in Peter Golden’s term)62 that reached its zenith under queen Tʿamar (1184–1211/2) The queen’s victories were chiefly due to the military successes of the Christianised Kurdish generals Zakʿare and Ivane, whose family name in Georgian is Mkhargrdzeli “Longomani ”63 The brothers took Ani in 1199 or 1201 and the queen bestowed it on them as fief 64 Under the rule of the Zakʿarids (the dynastic name of the Mkhargrdzelis), which survived for a while even after the Mongol conquest in 1239, the city experienced a renaissance and became again an important centre of international trade The route passed through Armenia to the Black Sea ports where Trebizond had become the

Byzantine capital (1204) after the fall of Constantinople to the crusaders 65 In Ani two caravanserais were built under Zakʿarid rule The façade of the southern caravanserai (596/1200–633/1236)66 was richly decorated with a pair of confronted dragons with wings and what appear to be forelegs above mythical winged quadrupeds carved onto the spandrels of the ogival arch which was originally covered with a bi-coloured inlay of carved polygons (fig 8) 67 The overall decorative scheme should however, as Rogers notes, be seen in the context of the evident taste of the Zakʿarid governors of the city for Anatolian Saljuq decoration which had resulted in the creation of a new “semi-Saljuq” Transcaucasian style that continued to flourish in Armenia and metropolitan Georgia long after the decline of the Zakʿarids 68 In the context of the confronted dragon representations in the spandrels of the early thirteenth-century caravanserai in Ani, it is worth mentioning that a near-identical location was reserved for the hybrid beasts in the upper section of architectural structures recorded in the two-dimensional medium of an Armenian manuscript of slightly earlier date, transcribed and illuminated in Cilician Armenia The shift in geography of Armenian cultural centres from the Armenian plateau westwards occurred after Saljuq raids that led to the capture of Ani in 1064 and Kars the following year, at which time the king, Gagik-Abas, was driven into Cappadocian exile This led to massive western migrations of Armenians which contributed to the re-Armenisation of ancient Armenia Minor as well as Cappadocia and Cilicia to the south In the kingdom of Cilicia in Tarsos, miniature painting attained a high degree of excellence Here in the monasteries of Mlich and Skevra the L’viv (Lemberg) Gospel was transcribed and lavishly illuminated from 1193 until 1198/99 69 The ten canon tables
are set within architectural frames consisting of two columns supporting arches Interestingly in the first two tables the uppermost sections of the rectangular headpieces carry confronted winged dragons, with long raptor-like forelegs, in the spandrels that surmount the archivolts The beasts are set against curling foliage, which is held in the dragons’ snouts on the headpiece over the Letter of Eusebius to Carpianus on the second canon table (fig 9) 70 The iconography of the dragons on these miniatures is clearly identifiable as Eastern Christian, or perhaps particularly Armenian, distinguishable from the Jazīran and Anatolian “Saljuq-style” dragon by the long raptor-like legs and the shorter snouts The Armenian predilection for representing dragons may perhaps be associated with the fact that in Armenia the dragon (vishap) belongs to the pre-Christian substrate71 and as a result is part of an ancient iconographical tradition, combined here with canonical scenes from Christian iconography In spite of the fact that these represent two-dimensional compositions on paper, they nonetheless suggest that placing paired dragons in the spandrels of an arch was not rare in pan-Transcaucasian architecture This is further corroborated by an analogous composition found on the arch of a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century wooden door from Godaïk in Ararat province, which is carved with confronted dragons represented without wings or legs 72 The placement of the dragons in the arch of a door may once again support the supposition that a protective function was intended A stone relief, now no longer extant, of paired confronted dragons with a quadripartite knot at mid-section with further knotted interlaces above and below was found at the hospital (darüşşifa) of the atābeg Lālā Jamāl al-Dīn Farrukh during the reign of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I of Konya in Çankırı (Gangra),

outside Ankara, built according to the inscription in Muḥarram 633/1235 73 The serpentine bodies were oriented to the left, their confronted heads with open jaws demarcated by almond-shaped eyes and topped by cusped ears, revealing sharp teeth and tongues 74 The heads would probably have been confronted although it is no longer possible to reconstruct this on account of the deteriorated condition of the lower dragon head (fig 175) Interesting in this regard is the record by Albert Gabriel of Süheyl Ünver’s suggestion that the paired dragons, joined at mid-section by a quadripartite knot, were an ancient symbol of healing used on hospitals, transmitted through the Saljuqs,75 an interpretation followed by Mehmet Önder who also associates the dragon iconography on the darüşşifa with healing 76 A second affiliation of the dragon with hospitals in Anatolia is found among the plaster reliefs on the façade of the Kay Kāwūs Darüşşifa in Sivas, datable to 614/1217, built during the reign of Kay Kāwūs I ibn Kay Khusraw I (r 608/1211616/1220) Now in very poor condition, they show traces of the body of one dragon with forelegs and spiralling tail, which can be presumed to have been complemented by a second dragon 77 Only three examples of the representation of dragons are known from Islamic sacred architecture from the period of the Saljuqs and their “successor states ” One example is the stone relief at a mausoleum (türbe) known locally as that of the Emir Saltuq after whom the Türkmen Saltuqid dynasty (c. 465/1072–598/1202), former commanders of the Saljuq army, is named It is the largest and most unusual of a complex of three tombs (Üç Kümbetler) just south of the walled city of Erzurum, near the Tabriz Gate 78 The drum is circumscribed by eight fan-shaped arched niches formed by the gables of the octagon’s roof, inside which are carved animal, vegetal and geometric compositions 79 Among the reliefs is a pair
of upright confronted dragons whose wide-open elongated fleshy snouts with upward-curling tips reveal a row of sharp teeth and projecting tongues and touch at the tips to form a diamond-shaped enclosure Small, rounded eyes and small, pointed ears demarcate the heads Their bodies entwine to form a loop at mid-section and interlace again at the bottom angle of the niche whence they curve upward to frame both diagonal sides The two creatures thus entirely fill the architectural space into which they are fitted (fig 10) 80 A striking parallel to the dragons on the türbe of Emir Saltuq is found at the church of Saint Gregory, which belonged to a monastery, located at the edge of Ani above the cliffs of the Arpa Çay gorge The presence of a new class of wealthy merchants that formed during the eleventh and twelfth century in Ani is attested to by the inscription of the merchant Tigran Honentsʿ on the church he erected in 1215 and dedicated to Saint Gregory the Illuminator The Greek-Orthodox tendency favoured during Zakʿarid rule continued to predominate in the architectural design of this church 81 However the depiction of the dragons, which appears on the fan-shaped spandrels of a blind arcade, follows the well-established Saljuqperiod conventions The recumbent confronted dragons are carved in a horizontal arrangement in the upper section They are portrayed resting on their forelegs, their heads crowned by a pair of pointed ears The hybrid creatures have squinting eyes and the characteristic wide-open jaws with rolled-up ends, sharp teeth and flickering tongues with bifid tips which nearly touch at the centre The sizable upper bodies extend into tapering tails which loop twice then arch over the back (fig 11) 82 It is interesting that the placement of the dragons in a niche is not the only feature to recall the dragons depicted on the türbe of Emir Saltuq, the date of construction of which is uncer

tain The dragons on the mausoleum are rendered upright with doubly entwined bodies and without forelegs, whereas the dragons on the church of Saint Gregory have a more horizontal orientation with individually looped tails Nevertheless, there is a consistency in the overall iconographic programme, which is why the dragon sculptures on the so-called türbe of Emir Saltuq may probably be asigned a thirteenth-century date The second Saljuq dragon sculpture on Islamic sacred architecture is found on the small “Kiosk Mosque” situated in the arcaded rectangular courtyard of the double-section caravanserai Sultan Han, located northeast of Kayseri, on the main road that once linked Konya, Kayseri and Sivas to the east (Iraq and Iran) It is the second largest Saljuq caravanserai in Anatolia and was built between 629/1232 and 633/1236 on the orders of ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I of Konya, as attested by an inscription on the portal Resting on a four-bay substructure, the south- and east-facing monumental ogival arches are both symmetrically framed with a complex serpentine festoon The latter is composed of reciprocally arranged pretzel-like shapes, culminating at the apex in confronted dragon protomes The heads with large, almond-shaped eyes, topped by backward-projecting pointed ears, have wide-open jaws revealing sharp teeth and tongues (fig 12) 83 Both the south- and east-facing reliefs are closely related but while the dragon protomes on the south side do not touch each other at the apex, the bodies of the dragon protomes on the east side are joined and enlivened by dots 84 Moreover, on the south-facing arch the dragon festoons end in small, inverted dragon heads with large eyes, necks bent inwards, with the open jaws appearing to hold the tip of the outer edge of the festoonband;85 it is thus interesting to observe that they seem to bite (in other words “swallow” or “disgorge”) their own tail tip, an aspect discussed in chapter 9 (fig 13) While this feature is not
recognisable on the east-facing arch (possibly on account of the surface deterioration), it shows, interestingly, an additional upward oriented, small dragon head, growing out of one of the bends of the dragon festoon to the left (fig 14) 86 Also of note is the fact that both serpentine festoons are surmounted by a further band enclosing a tightly woven knotted composition distinguished by a small eight-petalled star-rosette in the interstitial area at the apex (although on the east side, on account of the surface deterioration, this is no longer identifiable) Otto-Dorn interprets the rosette as a planetary symbol suggesting an astralmythological reading of the iconography 87 The third example is found in the relief sculpture of a pair of dragon protomes which spring from the base of a central vegetal composition topped by a double-headed eagle on the façade of the Çifte Minare madrasa at Erzurum (probably before 640/1242–3) 88 The relief featuring dragons springing from a conventionalised vegetal or tree-like composition, whose important symbolism is examined in chapter 4, is set within ogival niches at either side of the main façade, but only the relief to the right was completed (fig 43) 89 Rogers associates the Çifte Minare madrasa as well as the buildings of the Great Mosque and hospital at Divriği (626/1228–9 or later) with elements of a Caucasian building tradition (in particular with the influence of western Georgia (Tao-Klargeti)) 90 A fourth, yet less conspicuous, instance of dragons on sacred architecture of the Saljuq period may be noted in passing The end of one of the inscriptions at the façade of the Ak Mosque (617/1220–634/1237) at Anamur near Alanya shows a single double-headed dragon, knotted at mid-section and terminating at either end in an ophidian head 91 In the sacred architecture of the pan-Transcaucasian realm the dragon, as mentioned above,

Herzfeld, 1920, vol 2, p 266) dates the reliefs to the period of Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ (618/1222–657/1259) Further extensions and renovations were undertaken between 1248 and 1295 It is further of note that a 33 line Syriac inscription engraved on the walls of the church attests that the monastery was spared from destruction by the Ilkhan Baidu in 1295 Pognon, 1907, pp 132–42, 235, no 76; Fiey, 1959, p 50, and idem, 1965, pp 584–5 For a detailed discussion of the dating, see idem, 1965, pp 590–7 97 The monastery is named after Behnām, allegedly of the Assyrian family of Sennecherib II, the governor of Nineveh, who was killed together with his sister during the persecution of the Christians by Ardashīr (279–283), son of Shāpūr Cf idem, 1965, vol 2, pp 565–74
is found already at a much earlier date While its different manifestations will be examined in the following chapters, a noteworthy example, part of a frieze on the eastern façade of the Georgian church of the Virgin in Martʿvili in western Georgia, founded by king George II of Aphkhasia (912–957),92 may be mentioned in this context The frieze, which is finely carved with scrolling vines bearing clusters of grapes, also features several composite animals: a winged dragon, shown in profile with forelegs, is flanked on either side by other imaginary creatures On its left is a centaur-like depiction with quadruped body in profile, extending into a frontally rendered human upper body with large, stylised heart-shaped head which appears to be crowned by a halo, while on its right is a composite mythical animal now commonly identified as Sasanian-style sēnmurv It is rendered in profile with the protome of a canine dragon and the characteristic peacock tail 93 The dragon’s head is turned backwards towards the centaur, its long gaping snout revealing a row of teeth, the bifid tongue projecting towards its raised, unfolded wing The creature’s very long sinuous ophidian body forms a large loop, ascending behind the body to descend and taper to a point below the body of the centaur, whose forelegs rest on the attenuated tail end Of note is the ruff-like loop around the dragon’s neck, the ends of which curve sharply upwards, a feature which appears to be shared by the centaur (fig 15) The apotropaic character of these mythical animals, which are also a salient feature on the façade of the Armenian church of the Holy Cross at Aghtʿamar (915–921), may be presumed 94 Further of note is the striking difference in the depiction between this apotropaic dragon, rendered with forelegs, and the relief with a bicephalic ophidian dragon speared by two riders shown above the western entrance of the church, discussed below (fig 107) Another important architectural feature is found at the Armenian monastic ensemble at
Sanahin, near Alaverdi in Lori province, Armenia, which was established in 966 The monastery, which also served as Bagratid necropolis, not only functioned as a religious retreat but was an intellectual academy with a scriptorium for the copying and illuminating of manuscripts as well as a library Significantly, it is in the latter which was added in 1063 that relief-carved interlaced dragons are prominently depicted on a column capital After the destruction by the Mongol invasion decades earlier, the library was restored by bishop Stephen Sarkis and his disciples Herapet, David, Hesou and Karapet, in the late twelfth century (fig 16) 95 Of particular significance is the dragon iconography in the Eastern Christian sphere of the Jazīra Extremely interesting are its representations at the thirteenth-century monastery of Mār Behnām, also called Deir al-Khiḍr, southeast of Mosul, near the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud situated between the river Tigris and the upper Zab 96 The large, fort-like monastery was founded in the second half of the fourth century as a memorial to the Christian martyrs Behnām and his sister Sarah 97 The lintel immediately above the southern outer door in an internal corridor of the monastery carries a relief-carved depiction of a pair of addorsed recumbent dragons resting on their forelegs Their expansive finely scaled ophidian tails form a pretzel-like knot followed by a loop and are interlaced to form a horizontally oriented figure of eight along the central axis Small narrow wings attached to the haunches extend towards the back The creatures are flanked by seated lions portrayed in profile with head en face The paws of the inner legs are slightly raised and the long tails are drawn behind the flank of one of the hind legs and ascend in a slight curve terminating in dragon-headed finials behind the arched back A weathered frontally rendered lion head

projects above the centre of the relief Below, on the actual lintel, a Christian cross, from whose base also spring regardant quadruped dragons, is flanked, in turn, by pairs of confronted regardant birds whose tail feathers end in dragon heads with gaping jaws snapping at the birds’ tails (figs 17a and b, details figs 50 and 74) 98 The symbiosis of birds or felines with the dragon will be further examined in chapter 5 The bilaterally symmetrical configuration of the dragons shows them with entwined tails tapering to a pointed tip and forming a vertically oriented figure of eight Their scaly serpentine bodies are doubly intertwined in a pretzel-like knot and a simple loop The large heads, with characteristic wide-open jaws revealing two long pointed fangs and twisted forked tongues, face stemmed cups The almond-shaped eyes seem to squint slightly; small, cusped ears project at the top of the head Their supernatural properties are underlined by a pair of arched narrow horns, swept towards the back, and by the slender, curved wings that spring from an ornament that winds around the dragons’ haunches, terminating in an angular curl (a detail which can also be seen in the Cizre dragon-knockers, fig 83) The inner front leg is slightly raised, a feature that is paralleled in the figures of the flanking lions Significant are equally the closely related carved mouldings that provide an enlarged frame for the entire portal both at the monastery of Mār Behnām and at the thirteenth-century mausoleum of Imām Bahir in Mosul,99 which was possibly erected at the order of Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ (618/1222–657/1259) 100 In both cases stylistically and iconographically closely related compositions
of six pairs of dragons form trilobed arch-shaped niches that accentuate a portal At Mār Behnām the second southern portal leading to the chapel of the baptistery is framed by a moulding in the form of a knotted interlace composed of the bodies of six dragons that enclose a total of twenty-one niches (fig 18) 101 The horizontal section of the portal is defined by the entwined necks of the addorsed dragons, with the exception of the central arch-shaped enclosure that is topped by a projecting lion head en face The dragon heads are crowned by arched horns and small, cusped ears folded to the back; they are rendered with the characteristic wide-open mouths revealing a long tongue, the elongated upper jaws terminating in a rolled-up tip At the base the tails form a single loop The vertically interlaced ogival arch-shapes each comprise eight niches: three enclose hooded standing figures holding a book in the left hand and a cross in the right hand, probably representing monks,102 while the others contain the symbol of the cross The horizontal interlace encloses a tall standing figure next to a small, nude figure and a rider on horseback,103 also alternating with the cross motif The lintel carries a central Christian cross which extends at the base into a stemmed palmette At the portal leading to the vestibule at the mausoleum of Imām Bahir the frame is similarly set off with a knotted interlace, here accentuated with a scaly pattern, enclosing twelve niches, which contain foliate arabesques surmounted in the arched section with a tiny muqarnas (fig 19) 104 The lintel is inscribed with the words “Muḥammad, al-Malik, Allāh, ʿAlī ” The outer dragon pairs form a vertical interlace that encloses

four niches each, knotted with a simple loop at the points of juncture At the top the dragons terminate in the same manner as on the portal of Mār Behnām; however at the bottom of the niches the slightly tapered tails entwine to form a loop, whence they curl inward to terminate in a bird’s head with curved beak which pecks at the tail (comparable to the birds on the tail tips of dragons on the Cizre door-knockers (fig 83) and on the wing tips of the dragons at the Bāb al-Ṭilasm in Baghdad (fig 139a)) Just like the bottom mouldings, the central niches terminate at the top in addorsed heads and at the bottom in
tail ends that entwine to form a loop and thence taper to a pointed tip Also of note are the small star-rosettes which on both portals are set into the interstices of the vertical bands The representation of dragons situated at the approach to the most sacred part of the building, both in the case of the monastery of Mār Behnām, where they feature on the second portal leading to the chapel of the baptistery, and at the mausoleum of Imām Bahir, where they appear on the portal leading to the vestibule, indicates that their depiction was intended to serve as monumental apotropaion and to guard the entrance to a sacred space



the dragon motif on portable objects 35
a Overview
By their very nature, portable artefacts are characterised by their potential for movement across geographical, cultural and religious boundaries 1 Most of the objects under discussion testify to an overall westward migration of the dragon iconography from the Western Central Asian regions, facilitated by the movement of ever growing numbers of Turkic-speaking tribes, the dominant force being the Saljuqs, into Western Asia The latter took much from the artistic traditions of the Ghaznawids whose state they had destroyed 2 During the Saljuq period, the main artistic centres were located in greater Khurasan and northern Iran, with merchants and artisans becoming the principal bearers of cultural traditions 3 Able to move freely in the enormous empire, which reached from Khurasan to Syria and Asia Minor, the population aided the diffusion of prevailing styles and tastes which had a “markedly Khurasanian flavour ”4 Belonging to a wider, shared visual culture across the medieval Central Asian sphere, portable objects shared emblematic themes, reflected also on monumental representations The dragon motif is found on a great variety of artefacts, notably in the category of personal objects: specifically on accoutrements pertaining to the hunt or war and objects of personal adornment The semantic value of the dragon motif on the former would naturally have served to enhance the efficacy of these items When personal in nature and worn on the body, objects with this motif were popularly believed to provide the wearer with a prophylactic or apotropaic safeguard against a
variety of real or imaginary dangers The belief in the magical power of images meant that they could function as talismans intended, for instance, to promote well-being and to protect from the power of evil This is related to the age-old belief in the agency of envy and jealousy and the Evil Eye, which certainly survived through the medieval Islamic period,5 and the neutralisation of the harm that was intended to the person by wearing such a piece Hence the serpent or dragon comes to be looked upon as harbinger of good luck and bestower of prosperity In addition, such objects were often believed to endow their owners with certain abilities or powers One of the most widespread functions of talismans was in the form of amulets (tamāʾim, sing tamīma, or taʿāwīdh, sing taʿwīdh) intended to gain the assistance of unseen, supernatural forces that were believed to influence the affairs of humankind to achieve certain desired outcomes It is of course impossible to fathom how “potent” the motif was for the wearer, it may indeed be that some did not consider the dragon motif to have such explicit powers, using it as an ornament, but with prophylactic intent In general, though, it may reasonably be conjectured that the dragon iconography carried implicit semantics imbued with passively apotropaic, that is to say protective or actively beneficial properties, in other words empowering qualities designed to be imparted to the wearer Other objects such as vessels with this iconography may often have functioned as portable “apotropaia ” In spite of the fact that many pieces have a very varied iconography of which the dragon is only part, it may be hypothesised that dragon motifs, too, served to magnify the

THE DRAGON MOTIF ON PORTABLE OBJECTS

The heads of the mythical creatures, the Indian composite marine creature, makara, and the Central Asian dragon, were sometimes portrayed in a stylistically closely related manner Since only the head is portrayed, it is impossible to identify it with a degree of certainty as belonging to either creature, though both the makara and the Central Asian dragon can to a large extent be considered semantically equivalent Clubs terminating in dragon-like heads are featured in the seventh-century wall paintings at Sogdian Afrāsīyāb; see Albaum, 1975, fig 13 On the makara in Indian iconography, see Vogel, 1929–30, pp 133–47; Coomaraswamy, 1928–31, repr Delhi, 1971, pp 47–56, esp pp 47–9; Combaz, 1945, pp 146–55; Bosch, 1960; Rosenfield, 1967, pp 179–83; Boardman, 1986, pp 451–3 13 Colledge, 1986, p 21 and pl XLIa 14 Chegini and Nikitin, 1996, repr 1999, p 53 15 Bivar, 1975a, vol 2, pl 4a; Drijvers, 1978, p 172; Winkelmann, 2004, pp 248–51, fig 102

The dragon motif on weapons
Cudgels seem to have been the most widespread weapon in early Mesopotamia and Iran “Cast in yellow bronze,”7 they were the most powerful and the most victorious of all the weapons of the Vedic and Avestan gods 8 Cudgels or maces were also associated with the dragon-fighting Indo-Iranian mythical heroes,9 and hence possibly serve to characterise them as primordial warriors 10 Significantly, the mace of the legendary dragon-fighting hero Kərəsāspa (Garshāsp in New Persian poetry), celebrated already in the Zoroastrian yasna and Vidēvdāt, is said to have been carved in the shape of a dragon head 11 Similarly the Mathura portrait statue of the Kushāṇa king Kanishka is shown with a giant club tapering to an open-mouthed head of a dragon-like creature 12 The representation of the dragon on ceremonial weapons must be evidence of the intention to endow the weapon and hence its owner with the magical powers of the dragon The club was greatly favoured by the Parthians (250 bc–226 ad), too The club of Herakles, the most popular of Greek heroes, even appears as architectural decoration in the early Parthian monument referred to as the “Round Hall” in Nisa, the Parthian metropolis in present-day Turkmenistan 13 Maces and battle axes were used in the Parthian and Sasanian periods 14 An important depiction is found on a bas-relief from a small house-temple in Parthian Hatra in northern Mesopotamia (an integral part of Iran in Parthian and Sasanian times), which shows the composite figure of Herakles-Nergal,15 the god of the realm of death and the underworld, who can
intended effect of the vessels which were presumably meant to protect their maker6 and more often their owner, so functioning as protective devices This is emphasised by inscriptions invoking familiar expressions of wishes for blessings, luck, health, or long life for the mostly anonymous owner, which are frequently of amuletic character in themselves; these are rendered often in combination with figural decorations of a symbolic or “magical” significance such as the dragon A clear function of the dragon’s iconography was thus to reinforce the propitious, apotropaic, or even magical or supernatural powers of such portable objects
b The dragon motif on accoutrements relating to the hunt or war
Dragon imagery is attested on weapons and banners from early Zoroastrian times It is particularly associated with the mace and with the finials of ceremonial weapons or staffs which may carry sculpted dragons with a human or animal figure in their maw Dragon banners, an important part of military insignia from ancient times, appear in Iranian art and literature The dragon motif similarly occurs on weapon fittings, ritually significant belt/strap fittings and equestrian accoutrements The use of such imagery on the paraphernalia of heroism and rulership communicated mastery over the dragon and appropriation of its formidable qualities When featured on objects of personal adornment such as jewellery or beltornaments, the motif endowed such items with prophylactic or apotropaic powers

an initiation process, the successful completion of this ritual entitling the initiate to start a new phase of life or existence An analogous relief probably representing Jonah in the maw of a mythical creature, a “whale” with quadruped forelegs (only the protome is featured) is shown above the south door (east side) of the Georgian Tao-Klardjeti monastery church of Haho (Georgian Khakhuli), modern Bağlar Başi in northeastern Turkey, datable between the tenth and eleventh centuries (Baltrušaitis, 1929, pl LXXI, fig 118; Winfield, 1968, pp 62–3 (line drawing, fig 6), pl 30b) However, whereas on the relief of the Georgian church of Beris-Sakdari, the human figure is depicted with its head in the dragon’s maw (as if being swallowed), the Haho relief shows the figure’s upper body and head topped by small fish projecting from the beast’s jaws (as if being spat out) 25 Tr and ed Davis, 2008, p 388; the same metaphor is employed on pp 143, 166 and 230 26 Tr and ed Mohl, 1838–1878, vol 6, p 538 27 Idem, vol 6, p 88 For further examples cited in the Shāh-nāma, see, for instance, idem, vol 3, p 171, l 377, p 469, l 670; vol 4, p 13, l 95; vol 5, p 13, l 95; vol 6, p 233, l 876 28 Marzolph and van Leeuwen, 2004, p 542

24 The iconography of the dragon devouring or disgorging a human being or an animal such as a felid or a bovid is also known in the Christian iconography of the Caucasus A dragon with quadruped forelegs and a looped tail, portrayed in profile and depicted in the process of swallowing or delivering a proportionally small human figure, is shown above the southern entrance of the mid-tenth-century Georgian church of Beris-Sakdari, near the village of Eredwi in the Patara Liakhvi Gorge The depiction is probably related to the story in the book of Jonah in the Old Testament of a sea-monster or ketos who devoured and cast up the hero under divine command For the ketos, translated vishap, which swallowed Jonas in later Christian Armenian art, see Russell, 2004, p 373 The imagery of the dwellingplace of sinners “in the midst of the jaws of the dragon of the outer darkness” also repeatedly appears in the GnosticChristian writings of the Pistis Sophia (c fourth century) which are further discussed in the following chapters; Pistis Sophia, text ed Schmidt and tr Macdermot, 1978, bk III, ch 108, p 551, ch 119, p 609, ch 121, p 617 The fact that the imagery was depicted above the entrance to the church also indicates that its iconography was associated with the warding off of evil and the affording of protection Referring to the work of Vladimir Propp, Boris Marshak has pointed out the archaism of the theme of the hero being devoured by a monster (Propp, Vy , Istoricheskie korni volshebnoi skazki (“The Morphology of a Fairy Tale”), Leningrad, 1946, pp 200–23, as cited in Marshak, 2002, p 49, n 39) According to Propp (1984a, pp 116–8, 207, 208, and idem, 1984b, p 96) the imitation of devouring and expectorating of a hero by an animal such as a dragon was sometimes part of
Or, the hopelessness of a political situation, as expressed by one of the last Sasanian rulers, Khusraw II (Khusraw Parwīz, r 591–628):
But what can this avail now that my head is in the dragon’s maw?27
In Islamic culture dreams were considered an important means of communication with the world of the unknown Their meaning would be explained, often as a prophetic message from the world of the unseen 28 Hence, it is interesting to consider a dream interpretation recorded in al-Damīrī’s fourteenth-century para-zoological encyclopaedia which reverses the generally negative associations of the ophidian-devouring process He states that:
He who dreams of a serpent swallowing him, will obtain power 29
In the heroic epic Garshāsp-nāma composed by Asadī Ṭūsī in 456–8/1064–6, the eponymous hero, who is the great-great uncle of the legendary warrior Rustam, is requested by Ẓaḥḥāk at the tender age of fourteen to slay a dragon that dwells on Mount Shekāwand having emerged from the sea following a storm 30 The hero accomplishes the feat by clubbing the beast to death with a cudgel carved in the form of a dragon head 31 Employ
head holding in its wide-open mouth a bovid, whose protome peers out of the dragon’s jaws 24 Interesting in this regard is the use in medieval Iranian poetry of the metaphor “caught in the dragon’s maw” (akin to “held in the dragon’s claws”) which is conventionally used to reflect a potentially fatal calamity In the pre-Islamic epic, Wīs u Rāmīn (“Wīs and Rāmīn”), translated (from Pahlawī into classical Persian) and versified by Fakhr al-Dīn Asʿad Gurgānī around 442/1050, the protagonist Rāmīn uses it, for instance, to describe his separation from his beloved Wīs, the daughter of the queen of Media who is the wife of his older brother, king Mūbad of Marw:
I have left my hostage heart with you It is as if, upon your soul I swear, I’m in a dragon’s jaws when you are not there 25
In the Shāh-nāma, in which the ancient history of Iran, from its legendary origins down to the extinction of the Sasanian dynasty in 652 was recorded, this metaphor is used to describe a political misfortune, such as the defeat of the Iranians by the Türkmen:

rings, in the belief that its presence would aid in attaining victory over their opponents 40 Very informative in this regard is the entry under the heading yashf (“jade”) of al-Bīrūnī’s pharmacological work, the Kitāb al-Ṣaydala fi ’l-Ṭibb (composed in 442/1050), which states that dragon iconography was engraved on jade and used by the Turks to adorn swords:
The yashf stone: this is yashb on which they engrave the radiate dragon [al-shuʿāʿ is translated as “ray of light” in Steingass] We tested it without the engraving and it delivered [a result] Its characteristic, they say, is to dispel stomach pains “The stone of victory” is a variety of it and that is why the Turks adorn their swords with it 41
The affiliation of the dragon with arms was also made by the great twelfth-century poet Ilyās ibn yūsuf Niẓāmī Ganjawī (535–40/1141–6575–613/1180–217) in his romance Haft Paykar (“Seven Portraits”), when he compared to dragons the blades of the idealised fifth-century Sasanian king Bahrām Gūr’s (Wāhram V, r 420–38) army, and its arrows to the serpents of Ẓaḥḥāk, the tyrannical foreign ruler of Iran in the Shāhnāma from whose shoulders sprouted the notorious serpents 42 Similarly, the panegyrist and epistolographer Rashīd-i Waṭwāṭ (508–9/11145–573/1177–8 or 578/1182–3), who was born in Balkh, and spent most of his life as poet at the court of Khwārazm-shāh Atsїz, writes in his dīwān:

ing the principle of sympathetic magic – “like affects like” – Garshāsp succeeds in killing the dragon by means of a weapon carved with its own likeness This magical power appears to be contagious and can be transmitted from its source, in other words from the dragon onto different kinds of implements such as the mace32 or a staff, as evidenced, for instance, by a story recorded by al-Kisāʾī Here Mūsā similarly employes a mimetic or “homeopathic” principle by using his serpentstaff to strike a giant serpent that has devoured all the sheep of the Prophet Shuʿayb’s flock that pass through an exceptionally fertile valley thereby cutting it in two 33 Literary accounts of the medieval Islamic period describe the bejewelled weapons that were paraded on ceremonial occasions 34 Sabres were probably introduced into the central Islamic lands by the Turkic guard of the ʿAbbasid caliph al-Muʿtaṣim (218/833–227/842), which can be seen on a representation of a ninth-century wall painting in a building at Nīshāpūr that depicts a horseman with a belt with hanging straps designed to support a sabre 35 Quillon blocks extending into downward-curving prongs that terminate in dragon heads are a common feature on twelfth- or thirteenth-century sabres or daggers, as for instance on a gilded copper alloy sword guard fragment, or a nielloed silver scabbard, both thought to be from Syria or Palestine and now preserved in the Furusiyya Art Collection, Vaduz (fig 111) 36 Literary sources such as the Shāh-nāma similarly use the image of the (serpent-)dragon to describe swords, as for instance, those belonging to the dragon-fighting Kayanian king Gushtāsp,37 to Iskandar38 or to Fūr (Porus), king of India, who stopped Alexander’s advance in India 39 The Turks attributed magical properties to jade (nephrite) and called it the “stone of victory ” They used it extensively for fittings of weapons such as handles and quillon blocks, as well as for objects of adornment such as belt fittings and

Later on the emblem was introduced into the Roman army where the standard-bearer bore the title draconarius Such a banner with a dragon ensign belonging to the Dacians and their Sarmatian allies is portrayed on the narrative reliefs of Trajan’s column which commemorates the Dacian wars of the early second century ad The fluttering dragon ensigns were described by the contemporary Greek historian Flavius Arrian in his Tactica (XXXV 2–5) as being of “Scythian” origin:
Scythian ensigns are serpents of good length, tied to staffs They are made out of pieces of dyed material The heads and the bodies through to the tail are made in order to appear as terrifying as possible ... They swell in the wind of a ride so that they look like those serpents and even begin to whistle when the breath of air is strong enough 47
The dragon banner in the Roman army appears to have been instituted in the wake of the deployment of new tactical divisions as part of the Roman emperor Diocletian’s (r 284–305) reorganisation of the military machinery 48 Such dragon banners are again described by the fourth-century Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, who served in the army of Constantine II (337–361) in Persia, in his Rerum gestarum libri (XVI 10 7 and 12 39) In his record of Constantine’s entry into Rome in 357 (XVI 10 7) Marcellinus writes that the emporer:
was surrounded by dragons, woven out of purple thread and bound to the golden and jewelled tips of spears, with wide mouths open to the breeze and hence hissing as if roused by anger, and leaving their tails winding in the wind 49
(fig 24) The so-called “Saljuq-style” heads of the fabulous beasts are turned towards the back thus confronting each other with their wide-open jaws terminating in upward curled tips and revealing the tongues, the long cusped ears projecting at the top The quadruped protomes with snugly-fitted feet are oriented towards the edge of the chape, their serpentine bodies with slender, curved wings forming five loops attenuating towards its tip It is interesting to note a closely related depiction found on a twelfth- or thirteenth-century silk fragment from Samangan province in presentday Afghanistan, also housed in the al-Sabāh Collection in Kuwait, which is woven with an upright pair of dragons with gaping jaws, here in confronted position and wearing beaded collars, their winding serpent-like bodies having clusters of three dots in the bends and set against a background of foliate scrolls (fig 25)

In the Middle Iranian period, a dragon (azhdahā) was often depicted on standards carried in battle as a symbol of martial valour, intended to frighten the enemy by its ferocious aspect and to show the ruler’s power 44 These banners are referred to several times in the Shāh-nāma, in which the ancient history of Iran, from its legendary origins down to the dissolution of the Sasanian dynasty was recorded, as azhdahā-paykar (“having a dragon’s body”) 45 In his De historia conscribenda sit (XXIX) the second-century Greek writer Lucian describes the war against the Parthian king Vologesus III who defeated the Romans at Elegia in 162, destroying the Roman legion and killing the commander Severianus Lucian notes that the Parthians used banners with different emblems to differentiate the divisions of their army, a dragon ensign (dracōn) preceding a thousand-man division He refers to another historian’s vivid report of these dragon ensigns, which were made of light material, attached to open-jawed heads and mounted on poles, so that they would move in the breeze like enormous serpent-dragons, so much so that they appeared to the Romans to be:

akin to the dragon banners represented on wall paintings in Chinese Turkestan (present-day Xinjiang), discussed below Marcus Mode tentatively ascribes the plaque to the reign of the Xiongnu king of Sogdiana (Su-te) in the 30s of the fifth century attested by The History of the Wei (Weishu) 57 The Xiongnu were known to have fought under the dragon banner, a traditional ensign of the military forces of the steppes 58 Similar banners, some rendered in serpent or dragon-like form, are depicted on wall paintings in Chinese Turkestan, a region whose pivotal position at the crossroads between China and Central Asia resulted in a broad cultural synthesis which embraced the western Turks or Kök Türks (T’uchueh or Tujue) In the Cave of the Painter at Kizil (Kezier), a sixth- to seventh-century wall painting illustrates an army with a dragon banner 59 During the German Turfan expeditions at the beginning of the twentieth century, Albert von le Coq recorded several such banners At Kizil, in the “Cave of the Dove,” a seventh- or eighthcentury wall painting features a senāpatiratna, a deity who symbolises the wrathful power to overcome enemies, carrying a banner in the form of a serpentine body terminating in a swallow-tailed pennant with projecting dragon head with gaping jaws,60 and in the “Caves with Fireplace,” a warrior riding a war elephant also holds such a dragon banner 61 A wall painting discovered in the eighthcentury “Cave of the Doves” at Kirish, the ruins of Simsim, portrays a dragon-king (nāgarāja) above whom floats a large banner with lupine head and what appears to be a serpentine body 62 The wolf was one of the prevalent emblems on the military standards of Turkish tribes; other such emblems seem to have been the moon or the dragon 63
According to Moses of Chorene, in commemoration of the Armenian king Tigran’s resettlement of the defeated Medes to the area of Goghtʿn and around the foot of Mount Ararat, the windsock-like silk dragon (vishap) banner, adopted from the Parthians, became the Armenian king’s heraldic sign 50 In his account of the battle of Jiraw the sight of the banners (III 37) is similarly vividly conveyed:
the sinuous rippling of the dragon [banners], puffed up by the blast of air, their jaws yawning frightfully 51
An account of the anonymous fifth-century Armenian Epic History or Buzandaran Patmutʿiwnkʿ (IV 2) also describes the battle standard of the Arsacid Armenians (54–428) as a silk dragon banner 52 A description of the advance of the Iranian army is given in the grand heroic epic, Firdawsī’s Shāh-nāma, which states that:
behind each banner, there followed another banner – some with dragons, others with the image of eagles
showing that different royal emblems could be used concurrently 53 A dragon banner may be depicted on a bone plaque which is incised with a battle scene and probably served as a belt element 54 It was found in a necropolis near the village of Orlat in the district of Koshrabad, west of Samarqand, and, according to Boris Marshak, does not reflect a local but a Central Asian nomadic tradition 55 The mail-clad combatants are wielding lances, bows, swords and battle axes 56 Strapped to the lancer on the lower left is a military emblem, which may have served as badge of rank, a long, flowing banner on a pole

The dragon motif on belt/strap fittings and equestrian accoutrements
Girding with a belt was a rite of passage in all Central Asian, in particular Iranian, societies from ancient times 74 Adorned parade belts played an important role in the investiture of warriors in the Indo-Iranian world and were insignia of cultic or ritual significance as well as symbols of social distinction 75 In the Armeno-Parthian dynasty the belt was presented to the dihqāns (“members of the lesser feudal nobility”) along with a ring and a banner as tokens of royal service 76 The origin of the custom has been attributed to the sacred rope-girdle (kustī) of the Zoroastrians, for whom, however, such girding was an act of consecration, as in the rite of initiation In Turkish and Islamic society the belt was of great importance; it was an integral part of male costume, often presented by the ruler, and hence regarded as an insignia of rank 77 The nomadic warrior seems to have been girt with a pair of belts78 adorned in accordance with
In Asadī Ṭūsī’s Garshāsp-nāma the eponymous hero’s victory over the dragon was commemorated by a flag (dirafsh) embellished with the representation of a black dragon (azhdahāy-i siyāh) and a pole surmounted by a golden lion, in turn topped by a moon 64 The banner was passed on to Garshāsp’s descendants and became his family’s coat of arms 65 Likewise, the standard of the paladin Rustam, whose ancestors are thought to have been Saka people who came to Sakastān/ Sīstān and Zābulistān in the late second century bc,66 was “blazoned with the dragon’s form and from its tip a golden lion roars ”67 His grandfather, Sām, also had a dragon banner,68 as did Rustam’s son, Farāmarz 69 The Shāh-nāma account records that when Bahrām Chōbīn received the supreme command, the Sasanian king Hurmuz IV (578590) handed him the purple dragon banner with the words: “you are indeed a second Rustam ”70 Not only did Bahrām Chōbīn receive the distinguishing emblem which likened him to the great hero, but, in addition, he claimed Arsacid Parthian descent and was thus heir to the traditional Arsacid dragon banner 71 Dragon banners bearing the effigy of a gold-coloured dragon without legs or wings, the open mouth revealing the tongue, set against red and black grounds alternately, are featured on a page from a dispersed Shāhnāma. Painted in Shiraz in 742/1341, the miniature, which was formerly in the collection of the prince and the princess Sadruddin Aga Khan, now in the Aga Khan Foundation, portrays the victory of the dragon-slayer Bīzhan, grandson of the Iranian commander, Gūdarz, over Hūmān, brother of the Tūrānian commander, Pīrān;72 the banners being displayed in commemoration

Hungary, attributed to the second half of the seventh century (fig 26) 86 The beast is rendered in profile with elongated open snout, the upper lip curving upwards revealing a pointed tongue, crowned by horns or ears, with a beard projecting from the chin; the elongated, undulant, serpentine body covered with a spotted pattern is demarcated by crest-like, spiky protrusions, and rests on three curved legs with pointed protrusions at the feet, probably representing unsheathed claws Depicted at mid-section of the body is what appears to be a small version of the dragon An association of this representation with the Chinese dragon through Byzantine mediation has been proposed by Falko Daim on the grounds that the depiction of the dragon is comparatively rare in Avar iconography 87 Samuel Szádeczky-Kardoss however relates this iconography to Hellenistic (that is Seleucid and Parthian) and Sasanian influence, while underlining that “the subject matter [of the Avars] is taken from the body of beliefs proper to the peoples of the steppe ”88 Belts also had an important ceremonial significance and were a symbol of authority for the Samanids, Ghaznawids and Saljuqs 89 Tenth- or eleventh-century Western Central Asian belt hooks were commonly S-shaped with a central cuboctahedral or spherical knob, terminated at either end by a horned dragon head, one end bent to a closed position and with a heavy rectangular strap-slot 90 The dragon heads are shown with the wide-open snouts characteristic of the “Saljuq” type, the upper lip curving upwards and revealing a deep cavity with stumpy fangs A roughly contemporary horned dragon with open snout and sinuous body also occurs on narrow essentially rectangular copper alloy belt strap fittings from present-day Afghanistan, some of which are gilded 91
rank and ancestry 79 Hence on one belt a diagonally suspended bow in a long narrow bow-case and a quiver filled with arrows could be carried, while a sword or sabre and a dagger might be suspended from the second 80 Paired belts, a ceremonial main belt and another with straps from which the sword and other weapons were suspended, were, according to the Tarikh-i Bukhārā, worn by the young attendants (bandagān) at the court of the queen of Bukhara 81 Reports on the Turks in their homeland emphasise the importance of belts, which in addition to their utilitarian function served as status symbols The Turks are described as rich in cattle, horses and sheep and possessing “many vessels of gold and silver They have many weapons They have silver belts...”82 The Avars, an Ibero-Caucasian people who were subjects of the Turks, followed in the wake of the great migrations of nomadic peoples from the Eurasian steppes, fleeing to the north Caucasus region in 558 and from thence migrating westwards 83 Late Avar period iconography is preserved almost exclusively on items of personal adornment, in particular compartmentalised belt sets with multiple plaques figuring more naturalistic tamgas in the form of fabulous creatures reflecting “ancestral, totemic ideas ”84 Often these are shown in combat with ungulates or human beings perhaps symbolising “the cycle of death and rebirth ” Among the animals another hybrid creature with a long history in the Near East, the griffin, appears to have been particularly prevalent, however the dragon also made an appearance as did natural animals such as horses, eagles and wild boars 85 An elongated silver tongue-strap fitting (“Hauptriemenzunge”) with one arched end featuring a quadruped dragon was unearthed from grave 292 of an Avar necropolis in Abony,

curve under the haunches to project vertically above the back, ending in a split-palmette 93 The stylistic and iconographic stimuli for these relief sculptures are to be sought in post-Sasanian, Islamic and Transcaucasian art which may well have been well-known through textiles and other portable items 94 As a reflection of these eastern stimuli the late twelfth-century date of creation of the Vladimir relief sculptures thus provides an approximate terminus ante quem for dating the fitting with its forceful relief featuring a standing quadruped dragon which, in contrast to the more tame appearance of the beasts in the Vladimir reliefs, is characterised by an immediacy and innate animal nature, imbued with the vigour, physical power and lively spirit of wild beasts The dragon motif also extends to horsemanship Niẓām al-Mulk, the celebrated vizier of the Saljuqid sulṭān Alp Arslan and former Ghaznawid functionary, used the figurative expression “Exalted Stirrup” (riqāb-i ʿālī) in his Siyāsat Nāma when referring to the sulṭān 95 The metonym was used at Turkish as well as Iranian courts to denote “the sovereign himself or his presence, the foot of the throne ”96 It is thus fitting that a pair of standing quadruped dragons are depicted on the shoulders of a cast copper alloy horse stirrup which is probably from the Ghaznawid world, datable to the eleventh or twelfth century, now in the Nasser D Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, London (fig 28)
c The dragon motif on objects of personal adornment
In the Western Central Asian world the dragon also features prominently on objects pertaining to personal adornment Quadruped dragons appear on an eleventh- or twelfth-century soft stone mould of rectangular outline used for tooling leather, reportedly from Herat in northern Afghanistan and housed in the al-Sabāh Collection in Kuwait (figs 29a and b) Next to the patterning for two faces of a pouch featuring astrological and hunting scenes (as well as two small flaps), the mould is intaglio-carved with a pair of large, confronted quadruped dragons portrayed
An unusual depiction of a standing quadruped dragon appears on a richly gilded copper alloy fitting, probably for the strap of a parade belt, now in a private collection (fig 27) The head, turned backwards, has gaping jaws with fleshy folds, the upper lip terminating in a tight curl revealing rows of teeth, conspicuous projecting fangs and a long flickering tongue Small, circular eyes punctuate the head, which is crowned by small, cusped ears and extends into the long sinuous neck surmounted by a crest defined by deep hatching A split palmette projects from the haunches at the front and another extends from the tip of the long sinuous tail which curves under the flank to ascend vertically above the back The legs with delineated four-clawed feet are firmly planted on two platforms that project to form the base of the fitting, adding to the imposing plastic effect of the creature In spite of the uncommon appearance, its powerful and expressive monumentality must be the result of a long-established tradition Remarkably, distant cousins of the enigmatic beast, albeit no dragons, appear to survive on the low-relief carvings that cover a large part of the exterior of a cathedral of Saint Dmitry (1193–1197) in Vladimir in the northeastern principality Vladimir-Suzdal of Rus’ situated around the river Volga Named after the warrior saint Demetrius of Salonika, the cathedral was commissioned by prince Vsevolod III (1176–1212) for his own use Contacts with the east on the part of this principality, by way of the Volga, were much closer than with western Europe and it is generally thought that most of the characteristic local artistic features are due to Caucasian influences 92 Vladimir-Suzdal had close contacts with Armenia and Georgia, exemplified by the fact that prince yuri Bogolyubsky, Vsevolod’s nephew, was chosen as husband for the famed Georgian queen Tʿamar (1184–1211/2) in 1184 On all three middle pediments of the cathedral the biblical king David is portrayed as surrounded by the animals, several of which are rendered with stylistic aspects reminiscent of the dragon on the fitting, such as the elongated necks, the long legs ending in forceful delineated feet and, in particular, the elongated tails that

with elongated slender bodies standing on tall, splayed legs, with one leg raised in a formal stance Their snarling heads with long wide-open snouts reveal protruding sinuous tongues, while the top of the head has pricked ears and prominent elegantly curved horns The creatures are characterised by very long, narrow wings that surmount the back, and thin, elongated S-shaped tails The dragon also makes an appearance on a range of jewellery A roughly trapezoidal twelfth-century grey steatite jewellery mould from Maimana province (Faryab) in Afghanistan, now in the al-Sabāh Collection in Kuwait, is deeply carved for a simple loop ear wire, terminating at one end with a dragon head and a vent 97 An eleventh- or twelfth-century copper alloy ring from northern Afghanistan, preserved in the same collection, has tapering shanks that terminate on either side at the apex in doublecollared, bulging-eyed dragon heads, their lower jaws joining at the tips 98 Intertwined dragon protomes, joined by a single loop, appear as appliqués on the shoulders of a twelfth-century niello-inlaid gold finger ring, also in the al-Sabāh Collection in Kuwait The creatures are defined by confronted wideopen snouts with upward-curling tips that hold up a rectangular bevelled-edged agate seal stone which is inscribed in reverse Kufic script: “my sufficiency is in God and [it] suffices” (fig 30) These pious words were probably a supplication for help to overcome difficulties 99 The efficacy of the prayer was buttressed by the entwined dragons which in turn would have helped to enhance the ring’s protective properties The motif of the entwined dragons is further shown on an unglazed earthenware press mould of tapering rectangular form from Balkh in northern Afghanistan also in the al-Sabāh Collection in Kuwait The twelfth-century mould has a remarkable pictorial programme It shows a pair of addorsed regardant quadruped dragons in rampant posture with geometrically patterned elongated bodies Importantly, the winged creatures entwine at mid-section Their heads are crowned by long, curved horns and the open jaws revealing long tongues touch the scrolling foliage bearing round buds or fruit, possibly

game bird flies above The benedictory inscription in minute letters on the horse’s harness underlines the rider’s elevated position The scene is circumscribed by a band enclosing a procession of symmetrically arranged real quadrupeds as well as mythical creatures, the latter including a centaur-archer whose tail terminates in a dragon head The band is crowned at the top by a pair of expressive dragons with small wings and forelegs whose upper bodies cross (but do not loop) so that the gaping mouth of each appears to snap at the other dragon’s looped tail end (fig 33) 104 Their position at the apex, as Priscilla Soucek notes, brings to mind the use of architectural dragons as guardians at gates 105 Such a mirror would have belonged to the requisites of the nobility and may well, as Oya Pancaroğlu proposes, have been used as instrument “of allegorical reflection and divination ” This mirror thus “embodies a vision of kingship that extends beyond the horizons of temporal human dominion while affirming the universality of its royal centre ”106 Mirrors have a long history of association with apotropaic properties in antiquity and the medieval period, for they have the power of turning evil back upon itself 107 They are often linked with magic and the Latin version of the magical manual Ghāyat al-ḥakīm (“The Philosopher’s Goal”), attributed to Abū Maslama Muḥammad al-Majrītī (who wrote between 443/1052 and 448/1056),108 includes instructions on how to make a magic mirror, ascribed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān, the semi-legendary eighth- or ninth-century author of a large body of Hermetic alchemical literature The owner of this mirror was said to have power over the winds, humankind and demons 109 The amplified depiction of the dragon on such a multi-layered object, as pair at the apex, below the horse’s hooves and as the centaur’s tail, shows that it was considered an extremely valued and compelling iconography that was deemed necessary to further increase the potency of the mirror’s inherent properties
paradigm, embracing as it does both Byzantine Greek and Türkmen visual traditions, but also as a step towards asserting the identity of this Artuqid ruler The choice of this particular motif as emblem by a Türkmen leader is particularly important since it gives weight to the hypothesis that the interlaced dragon figure was introduced into Islamic art from Central Asia via the Turkish dynasties 102 The use of a symbol which must have carried Iranian cultural associations may thereby represent a conscious effort to revive a visual heritage from the past which at the same time served as a means of self-identification Dragon imagery on Central Asian objects of personal adornment was also found at the frontier town of Ūtrār, located at the confluence of the Aryss and the Syr Daryā rivers Excavations yielded a signet ring featuring a rider on horseback killing a dragon, an iconography that will be discussed in greater depth in chapter 7, together with bracelets terminating in dragon heads 103 The incident at Ūtrār where a Mongolian caravan was massacred by Khwārazmian officials led to the invasion of Transoxania by Genghis Khān’s troops in the autumn of 616/1219 and the city’s destruction shortly thereafter It signalled the beginning of the Mongol conquest of Western Asia Whereas the Central Asian world yields a wide range of objects of adornment decorated with the likeness of the dragon, comparable finds from Anatolia and the Jazīra from the eleventh to the thirteenth century are generally extremely rare However, on the back of an early- to mid-thirteenth-century Saljuq gold-inlaid steel mirror, which would have been a prime accoutrement, now in the Topkapı Sarayı Müzesi, the dragon occurs three times with different connotations The central field is decorated with a mounted falconer on a richly caparisoned horse with a hunting dog attached by a leash to the saddle A small, looped dragon with raised, gaping head appears just in front of the horse’s hooves, a quadruped, probably a fox, seeks cover at the back, and a

dragons topped here by projecting lion-headed knobs (fig 57) 113 The dragon’s close connection with water has been manifested since ancient times and its ensuing depiction on vessels containing liquid is known at least from the early medieval period Often this is expressed in dragon-headed spouts This feature appears on an automaton depicted in the treatise written by the court engineer Abu ’l-ʿIzz Ismāʿīl ibn al-Razzāẓ al-Jazarī (fl second half of sixth/twelfth century) which details the various automata commissioned by the Artuqid ruler Nāṣir al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Muḥammad al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ (r 597/1201619/1222) for the court’s amusement The resulting work, Kitāb fī maʿrifat al-ḥiyāl al-handasiyya (“Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices”), dates to c 1200 114 Al-Jazarī’s “Handwashing machine,” which was designed for ritual ablutions, is depicted with a dragon-spouted ewer on a leaf from the earliest extant manuscript of this work dated to the end of Shaʿbān 602/about 10 April 1206, copied by Muḥammad ibn yūsuf ibn ʿUthmān al-Ḥaṣkafī (“of Ḥiṣn Kayfā”) at Diyārbakr, and now preserved in the Topkapı Sarayı Library, Istanbul When the machine was turned on, water flowed from the cistern in the servant’s chest into the ewer, the bird on the lid of the vessel whistled and the liquid poured out of the gaping mouth of the dragon-headed spout (fig 35) 115 Such a spout is also portrayed on a Jazīra-type copper alloy ewer (with recently replaced silver inlay), the so-called “Homberg Ewer,” now preserved in the Keir Collection in London, which has an overall decagonal outline The lower part of the neck is inscribed with the signature of the artist, Aḥmad al-Dhakī, the engraver, al-Mawṣilī and the date 640/1242 116 The dragon motif in manifold variations is frequently found as part of the decorative programme of vessels, as for instance on a rectangular brass tray inlaid with silver and with a central cruciform depression in which four pairs of dragons
d The dragon motif on vessels
The depiction of the dragon is frequently found sculpted as part of vessels, for instance on the arched handles of two celebrated buckets both of which are now preserved in the State Hermitage, St Petersburg One of these is the richly silverand copper-inlaid copper alloy bucket, named after its collector, Count Alexei Bobrinsky, the famous “Bobrinski bucket,” which was purchased in Bukhara in 1885 by N N Shavrov, the adjuntant of General Chernyayev, governor general of Turkestan (fig 34) It was probably made in Herat, one of the main cultural centres of the province of Khurasan which flourished especially under the Ghurid dynasty, during whose rule the vessel was produced as indicated by the date muḥarram 559/December 1163 inscribed in Kufic at the top band of the handle of the bucket 110 The loops of the handle are in the form of a leaping lion and on the inside a dragon protome, from whose gaping mouth issues the four-sided arched section inscribed on two sides in naskhī with benedictory inscriptions (fig 56) The second bucket, which in the mid-nineteenth century was in the Parisian collection of Louis Fould before coming into the possession of the St Petersburg jeweller, A K Fabergé, is signed by its maker, Muḥammad ibn Nāṣir ibn Muḥammad al-Harawī The toponymic (nisba) al-Harawī (“from Herat”) perhaps indicates the origin of the maker, and indeed the bucket is thought to have been made in late twelfth- or early thirteenth-century Khurasan, probably in Herat 111 yet nothing is known of the maker who could also have migrated from Khurasan westwards; moreover, on the basis of its faceted body and gilt ground as well as several decorative elements, it has recently been attributed to the early thirteenth-century Jazīra, northern Syria, or possibly Anatolia 112 Its handle is closely related to that of the Bobrinski bucket and is similarly held in place by loops in the form of curved

of the creatures are entwined with the contiguous addorsed dragons’ tails (fig 36) They are portrayed with their inner forelegs raised, their wideopen jaws revealing the tongues and the upswept, curved wings with tightly curled tip projecting from the haunches The dragons’ hide is covered with scales, the tails knotted at mid-section to form a figure of eight Importantly, the tapering tail tips transform into small dragon heads which appear to grasp or snap at the serpentine coils 119 An epigraphic frieze around the shoulder invokes blessings such as glory, prosperity, perfect health, good fortune, felicity, etc , upon the owner It is notable that the paired dragons have close analogies to the dragon figures carved in low relief on three relief-carved stone panels from the now destroyed city walls, gates or citadel of Konya (618/1221) (fig 60) Like their monumental cousins, the miniature versions of the dragons on the candlestick base may well have conveyed an impression of might and good fortune, thus augmenting the impact of the epigraphic blessings
are portrayed with their heads turned back and their tails intertwined The well-wishing Arabic inscriptions are typical of Western Central Asian metalwork In the medieval Islamic world inscriptions bestowing blessings on the owner were often combined with figural decorations of a symbolic or magical intention,117 in order to magnify the overall apotropaic function intended to benefit the maker and owner of the objects Not least because of the epigraphic bands which are typical of Khurasani metalwork, the tray has been attributed to the first half of thirteenth-century northeastern Iran; however on the basis of the creatures’ entwined tails an Anatolian or Jazīran provenance has recently been suggested 118 A related composition also fills the inner band of three zigzag bands that circumscribe the conical base of a thirteenth-century copper alloy candlestick base, inlaid with silver, which is preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New york It comprises bilateral compositions of confronted pairs of quadruped dragons in profile The tail tips

are associated with the fertilisation of the earth Their absence and re-emergence according to the cycle of the seasons (during the dormant season it hibernated in the ground)4 may also be seen as a metamorphosis In the Rigvedic pantheon a primordial “serpent of the deep,” Ahi Budhnyà, is known;5 the Vedic áhi- meaning “serpent, snake,” while budhnyàis an adjectival derivative of budhnàs “bottom, base ” The origin and abode of the “dragon of the deep” is the dark bottom of heavenly waters, he is “sitting in the depth of rivers” (budhne nadīnāṃ rajaḥsu sīdan) 6 In the Rigveda (dating from 1500–1000 bc) budhnàs is used of the root (in heaven) of the cosmological Nyagrodha tree (1 24 7),7 hence associating the serpent with a tree 8 In later Indian literature water is known as the abode of serpent demons 9 Apart from the aquatic monster Gandarəβa who lives in Lake Vārukasha (originally perhaps denoting a specific location such as Lake Aral or the Caspian Sea), the Iranian Zoroastrian dragons were terrestrial creatures, “inhabitants of this world,” and the connection with water is less evident in Zoroastrian literature, with the exception of some references to river-dwelling dragons 10 yet in almost all of the stories in Iranian literature, the dragon’s lair is close to either a source of water or the sea,11 for instance, the dragon-fighter Garshāsp in the Garshāsp-nāma kills a dragon which had emerged from the sea and made its abode on Mount Shekāwand, while Sām in the Shāh-nāma12 slays
a The dragon and the elements
Equally at home on land and sea, the dragon is associated with remote places and phenomena of the natural world Its aquatic nature is profoundly ambivalent: as water dweller it can be both benevolent guardian and malevolent destroyer In its threatening manifestation the creature is linked to adverse climatological phenomena such as thunder, rain, lightning or earthquakes The symbolic complexity of the dragon is thus expressed through its ability to cross boundaries within the natural environment it inhabits The distinction between land- and sea-beast is often blurred That the dragon or the large serpent can be both aquatic and terrestrial was noted in the fifth-century Armenian theological writings of Eznik of Koghb 1 According to the texts of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ (Brethren of Purity, established c 373/983), the likeness, character and manner of the dragon is like the sea serpent 2 Both aquatic and terrestrial, the dragon, like its close cousin the amphibian serpent, is thus characterised by a wet-dry dichotomy as noted by the fourteenth-century scholar Kamāl al-Dīn al-Damīrī in his Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā 3 They dwell not only in springs, wells, rivers, lakes or sea water, but also in mountains, forests, caverns, caves, crevices and other subterranean enclosures, hence lending themselves to association with the underworld and chthonic forces In tunnelling into the earth and resurfacing again above ground, they

a dragon from the river Kashafrūd in Khurasan 13 The dragon’s aquatic nature is clearly perceptible in the Armenian vishap (Georgian veshapi, also a fabulous serpent; Syriac wshp; a loanword from the Avestan vishāpa-, “whose saliva is poison”) was used as an epithet to azhi, “serpent,”14 which was said to dwell in the waters of a lake 15 In the ancient Semitic world the predominant belief was that both wood and water are potent generating forces,16 a notion which continued to exist in the medieval Islamic period 17 Holy trees are known either by direct assertion or by implication to be associated with spring shrines 18 Often the sacred spring or well spirit or numen was an accompaniment of a sacred tree19 or sacred place 20 Sources of life such as wood and water are also considered to be channels of a greater power; the power that is contained in them is thought to be “contagious ”21 In the Islamic period trees and twigs as part of trees were widely used for religio-magical purposes, and by extension, any magic rods or wands used in such practices were related to the idea of woody plants 22 The association of vegetation and the dragon is reflected in the description by the universal historian Abū Jaʿfar Muḥammad ibn Jarīr ibn yazīd al-Ṭabarī (c 224–5/839–310/923) of the rod of Mūsā (Moses) as a:
two-pronged fork with a crook under the meeting point of the twigs and when it was turned into a serpent, the two twigs formed the mouth of the serpent with its forked tongue, while the crook took the shape of the crest 23
The numinous power inherent in the serpent, discussed further below, is also reflected in the Qurʾānic story of Mūsā’s rod turning into a serpent, which is an example of the living power of the rod 24 The ancient association of the dragon with water is revealed in the names of streams, lakes, pools or springs that are also often compared with each other in poetic simile The serpent as guardian and custodian of a water source is referred to by the ancient Greek term drakōn in the second-century ad compilations of PseudoApollodorus 25 According to the Byzantine historian Procopius of Caesarea, a river in Bithynia was called Drakōn because its shape resembled that of the fabulous monster 26 The sacred fountain of Ephca at Palmyra, which is a sulphurous spring, is associated with a demon in serpent form 27 As William Robertson Smith has pointed out, there are indications that in certain instances the original sanctuary was at a well beneath the town as was the case of the original sanctuaries of Jerusalem, such as the fountain of En-Rogel (1 Kings I, 9, 38) where Adonijah held his sacrificial feast, located near the “serpent’s stone” which may possibly be identified with the “dragon well” (Nehemiah II, 13) 28 Sacrifices offered at the well of Abraham at Mamre were said to be eaten by the serpent denizen of the water 29 In Syria sacred springs were thought to be guarded by spirits in the form of giant pythons 30 The chronicler of the early Byzantine period, Ioannes Malalas (d c. 570/580), mentions that the partly subterranean river Orontes in Asia Minor was called Drakon,31



dragons and the powers of the earth 53
Fontenrose, 1959, repr 1980, pp 277–8 32 Reportedly this is because the wounded drakōn Typhon had crawled into the underground channels of the source of this river to seek shelter from the thunderbolts of Zeus (Strabo, Geography XVI, 750) The name of the Greek she-dragon Pythōn (phuth- from Vedic bhudh-) who is slain by Apollo with his arrow (Fontenrose, 1959, repr 1980, pp 13–45) also demonstrates the inherent designation of a serpent creature of the watery deep (Watkins, 1995, p 461) The Pythōn myth, as Joseph Fontenrose (1959, repr 1980, pp 77–93, 193) shows, largely corresponds with that of Typhon In the Greek tradition the outer ring of the world’s water, the ocean (Ogenos-Okeanos), is also the lair of Ophioneus (Ophiūchus), the serpent-man who tried to overcome Zeus (Janda, 2010, pp 71–89; Russell, 2004, p 718) In Phaedo Plato’s literary figure, Socrates, compares the rivers to the serpent: “There are some, then, that after having encircled the earth with one or more coils, like snakes, descend so deeply that they come out at the lowest point of Tartarus,” as cited in Mastrocinque, 2005, p 29 Cf Robertson Smith, 1889, repr 1927, p 176 and n 4 33 Franke, 2000, pp 100, 547–9 34 Cited after Steingass, 1892, repr 1981, p 1130 35 See the preface of the Oxford Kitāb-i Samak ʿAyyār (Bodleian Library Ms Ouseley 379–81); Sachau and Ethé,

and was, according to Strabo, also known as Typhon and Ophites 32 The continued association of the Orontes with the mythical dragon is shown in a Turkish legend from Hatay which states that the river was created when the dragon took flight from the mysterious immortal Islamic Prophet Khiḍr by digging underground channels 33 In Persian the close affiliation between the serpent and the stream of water is reflected in the word liwāʾ which comes to mean “the winding of the river” as well as “the twisting or coiling of a serpent ”34 A serpent spring also makes an appearance in the Kitāb-i Samak ʿAyyār (“Book of Samak the Adventurer”), collected by Farāmarz ibn Khudādādh al-Arrajānī and written down by Ṣadaqa ibn Abu ’l-Qāsim Shīrāzī,35 which is thought to be rooted in the Parthian period 36 The association of the dragon with water is similarly evident in the Transcaucasian tradition The appellation of the Armenian river Awji near Awjaberd in Gegharkʿunikʿ province contains just like the toponym the word awj (serpent) 37 One of the most ancient Armenian cults, that of tree worship, is often connected with water sources and serpents In his collection of Armenian folklore entitled Krots-Prots (ch 9), the eighteenthcentury clergyman Garegin Servantsian records the ancient belief that aged serpents come to a certain source to shed their skins, eat a flower which only they know, bathe in the spring and are then rejuvenated Anyone who finds the same
flower and eats it and then drinks three times from the water in which the serpent bathed will similarly become immortal 38 In pre-Islamic Central Asia, in particular in the regions of presentday Afghanistan, the connection of dragons with water was expressed by the pan-Indic serpent deities (nāgas), the serpent genii, who dwell in terrestrial water sources, and to whom were attributed tempests and floods 39 In Kashmir, the word nāg occurs in a variety of names of springs, rivers, or reservoirs, for instance, Lake Nīla Nāg in the region of Nāgām (ancient Nāgrāma) 40 This close association of the dragon with the element of water also led to its depiction on waterspouts This is evidenced in the Islamic period in the example of Karatay Han situated between Kayseri and Malatya Two of the conduits used for drainage from the gutters of the roof (gargoyles) of the mid-thirteenth-century caravanserai have the appearance of winged dragonite protomes that hold in their wide-open mouths what appears to be the stylised upper body of a human being whose hands clutch the monsters’ forelegs (fig 37) 41 The dichotomy of the dragons is evident in their activities either as guardians of natural sources or as ravagers in the form of destructive natural phenomena In the popular mind dragons lent themselves naturally to functioning as symbols for the mysterious and destructive forces of the earth The notion of dragons as guardians of water

sources, which was well-known in ancient Greek sources,42 is recorded in the medieval period by the twelfth-century Byzantine scholar Ioannes Tzetzes, a commentator on Lycophron 43 By contrast, destructive natural phenomena attributed to dragon monsters, also well-established themes in ancient Greek sources,44 were mentioned by the tenth-century Arab encyclopaedist al-Masʿūdī who associates meteorological phenomena with the mythical creatures He reports that the Caspian and the Mediterranean (near Tripoli and Latakia) were “prolific in sea monsters” (kathīr al-tanānīn), adding that according to tradition the sea monster (al-tannīn) was a “black wind nurtured in the depth of the sea, which ascends to the zephyrs ” He adds the account that the al-tannīn were:
...black serpents existing in the plains and mountains, in which places there are floods and rainstorms, carrying them down into the sea, where they feed upon the sea-creatures so that their bodies attain great size, and their age is extended, and in the end some of them achieve the age of 500 years, and become the lords of the sea These stories are by no means denied by the Persians, who assert that the monsters have seven heads, and are called Ajdahā [Azhidahāka] 45
The celebrated thirteenth-century cosmographer and geographer Zakariyyāʾ ibn Muḥammad ibn Maḥmūd al-Qazwīnī (c 600/1203–4–682/1283), who originated from an Arab family that had been Iranised after settling at Qazwīn, similarly relates that the Iranians believed “the sea-dragon to be either a hurricane or a black serpent dwelling on the sea bottom ”46
The Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ, whose Rasāʾil (Epistles) appeared in the tenth century, states that, on
account of the formidable fire created by the venom which sits between his jaws and moves freely in flames within his body, the dragon endeavours to obtain relief in freezing temperatures The text describes that as a result of the intensity of the fiery heat of his venom, the dragonking seeks as abode the peaks of high hills and mountains, above the regions of mild air, in a region where the cold is so intense that there can be neither clouds nor rain, and where neither plants nor animals can survive 47 Citing Ibn ʿAbbās, al-Masʿūdī, moreover, reports the medieval Islamic idea that “when the tail of a dragon strikes a large edifice, (like) a tree or mountain, it destroys it Furthermore, at times when the dragon breathes it sets fire to large trees,”48 apparently describing natural manifestations such as earthquakes This association between dragons and fire is similarly mentioned in the Kitāb-i Samak ʿAyyār 49 The fiery breath of the notoriously pelagic biblical Leviathan is also described in Job (41:11–3):
Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a burning pot or cauldron His breath kindles coals and a flame goes out of his mouth
Moses of Chorene’s writings also preserve preChristian Armenian religious poetry which describes the birth of Vahagn, god of strength and victory Sudden storms or winds on Lake Van are a sign that dragons (vishap) live in the lake, growing there until they are large enough to destroy the world, at which point Vahagn (probably conflated in this story with the Hurrian weather god Teshub, the Urartean Teisheba)50 drags the dragons up from the depths to take them into the sky to burn up in the sun 51 The twelfth

century Armenian historian Matthew of Edessa (Mattʿēos Uṛ hayetsi) relates the eruption of volcanoes to the fiendish nature of dragons, referring to this phenomenon metaphorically as the dragons of Mount Ararat fighting those of Mount Aragac 52 An echo of the ancient association of dragons with water seems distantly to reverberate in the ancient Iranian festival of Sada, the celebration of which, according to the historian of the Ghaznawid dynasty, Abu ’l-Faḍl Bayhaqī, resumed during Ghaznawid times For the celebration of Sada, a festival held fifty days before Nawrūz (the celebration of the return of spring), large fires are lit in commemoration of the Pīshdādian king Hūshang (Haoshyaṅha), the first lawful king who reigned over the seven climes of the world, over the demons and the sorcerers, and according to al-Bīrūnī, and later Firdawsī, was the inventor of fire As stated by the latter, Hūshang also originated the idea of using irrigation canals Firdawsī, moreover, records the king’s feat of valour in vanquishing a monstrous dragon that infested the country and which the king himself attacked with stones, “when one of them falling with prodigious force upon another, struck fire and set herbage and surrounding trees in a blaze, and consumed the dragon in the flames ”53 The writer adds that the legendary pre-Islamic monarch “gave orders that prayers should be said facing a fire, saying: It is the spark given by God (Īzād); worship it if you are wise ”54 Sada was held in winter “to strengthen the sun and to help bring back warmth and light to the world ”55 As was customary, sulṭān Masʿūd of Ghazna (the son and successor of Maḥmūd) chose to celebrate it beside a stream, where a fire was lit56 to aid symbolically the stream of water “in his subterranean task of protecting plants and springs from frost ”57 The affiliation between dragon, water and earth also becomes apparent in the Alexander Romance by the Pseudo-Callisthenes, thought to have originated at some time prior to the third century ad
as a collection of oral legends and other material A good portion of the material was progressively gathered in written form, probably assembled in Alexandria, and entered the Iranian tradition no later than the Sasanian period In this romance Iskandar (Alexander) is flying through the air on the back of the eagles when, at the highest point of the sky, he sees an enormous serpent whose coils enclose a disc representing the world surrounded by the ocean 58 In medieval Iranian poetry, the transformative power of the dragon is sometimes evoked as a portent to signal changes in the course of human events or impending alterations in the cosmic cycle This type of metaphor is employed in the verse romance, Wīs u Rāmīn, composed by Fakhr al-Dīn Gurgānī for the governor of Iṣfahān on behalf of the Saljuqids The story relates how Rāmīn has become unfaithful to Wīs who remonstrates with him in a long elaborate letter reminding him of her love Rāmīn sets off to Marw in the hope of a reconciliation with his beloved, but when he arrives on horseback, a snowstorm is in progress The meteorological phenomenon is figuratively associated with the dragon to evoke human emotions:
the skies became like some vast dragon breathing tongues of flame; the snow was like a poison, since within it men’s hearts would freeze and stiffen in a minute, black clouds were massing, blocking out the light, choking back breath, depriving eyes of sight; the snow blew with such force that elephants could not have stood its vehemence 59
The natural phenomenon thus described correlates with the human event by functioning as a form of inauspicious portent A dragon in the form of a black cloud appears also in the epic poem Bahman-nāma (“Book of Bahman”), in which Ādar Barzīn, the son of the dragon-slayer Farāmarz, recognises that the cloud is a transformed dragon which came out of a mountain every spring to violate the daughter of the local ruler, Bīwarāsp/Dahāk He kills the dragon with

arrows and then washes at a spring 60 In this story the killing of the dragon is followed by contact with water In the Shāh-nāma a similar reference is made Both heroes, Rustam, after he had killed the dragon Babr-i bayān which came out of the sea once a week, and Borzū, after he had vanquished the dragon on Mount Zahāb, lose consciousness, and on reviving also wash themselves in a spring 61 Likewise in another episode of the Shāh-nāma, after accomplishing the third of his seven trials (haft khwān), that of slaying the dragon, Isfandiyār, one of the prince-heroes of the epic and eldest son of shāh Gushtāsp, loses consciousness On reviving, “he called for a new garment, and then immersed himself in a nearby stream, washed the dirt from his body Thus cleansed, he came before the Lord Down on the ground again, contorting and writhing like a serpent, he cried out:
Must it not be that the dragon-slayer is constantly sustained by the One who grips the world?
The troops invoked blessings upon their leader, and all of the company bowed low before the Just Provider ”62 Frequent reference is thus made in the legends to a loss of consciousness of the hero in the aftermath of the dragon-slaying and his subsequent contact with water that is known to have a “magical” cleansing effect and to be a transformative agent The purification thus constitutes a rite of separation from the act that has been accomplished That water is an agent of transformation is further evidenced in an account of the slaying of a dragon (shīr-i kappī) in Turkestan by Bahrām Chōbīn, Sasanian commander of Hurmuz IV (r 578–590), rival to the throne of his son Khusraw

b The serpent(-dragon) jinn
Sources of water such as wells or streams, manifestations of life around which vegetation spread, were thought to be endowed with properties of generation, cleansing and in some cases with medicinal or healing virtues 64 These were sometimes also regarded by the Arabs and other Semites as inhabited by the serpent genie (jinn), and hence had a sacred significance 65 Serpents as well as the jinn (pl ajnān, “genii”),66 the supernatural spirits invisible to the human eye, whose existence is recognised in the Qurʾān (sūras 72, 130; 37, 158; 51, 56; and 55, 15), were considered from the oldest times as the general earthly genius loci of trees, in particular roots of trees, as well as caves, springs and wells 67 According to a tradition of the Prophet Muḥammad cited by al-Damīrī in his para-zoological encyclopaedia, chthonic creatures such as serpents represent one of three categories of jinn 68 While usually invisible, the jinn liked to manifest, according to Muslim popular belief, as creeping creatures, reptiles and amphibians, in particular serpents 69 In pre-Islamic Arabia, the jinn were regarded as semi-divinities 70 The serpents’ close association with metamorphosis was motivated by their mutant nature, manifested by behaviour such as the periodical sloughing off their skin, living in water or tunnels beneath the earth and alternating between land and water This aptitude to metamorphose was often seen

were “by the serpent of God” and “by the serpent of the Kaʿba,” respectively, and hence meant that, just like the oath discussed above, these formulas were made “by the sacred serpent ” 79 For this as well as further traditions, see Ḥamd Allāh al-Mustawfī al-Qazwīnī, The Zoological Section of the Nuzhatu-l-qulūb, tr and ed Stephenson, J , London, 1928, Persian text, pp 55–6, tr p 38, as cited in Ettinghausen, 1955, p 277 80 Al-Azraqī, Kitāb Akhbār Makka, I, pp 377–9, as cited in Atallah, 1975, p 166 81 Idem, p 166

as a source of numinous or demonic power As primarily chthonic creatures, yet able to undergo so portentous a transformation, the jinn embody “the undefined and innominate divine,”71 having a very close and necessary link with the serpent 72 The close association of some jinn with trees through their characterisation as the spirit that resides in vegetation,73 is exemplified in the story of Ḥarb ibn Omayya and Mirdās ibn Abī ʿĀmir, historical persons who lived a generation before Muḥammad When the two men set fire to an inaccessible, knotty thicket, the jinn, taking the form of white serpents, flew out of the burning grove of al-Qurayya with doleful cries and the intruders died soon afterwards 74 It is believed that the jinn slew them “because they had set fire to their dwelling place” and thus violated their haunt 75 In the Islamic period the pagan gods of the so-called Jāhiliyya period, considered to be the time of ignorance and false beliefs, were broken, their sanctuaries destroyed and their guardians dispersed 76 The gods and demigods were subsequently downgraded into jinn 77 The serpent was one of the most ancient sacred symbols of the pre-Islamic cults,78 however since Islam broke with these pre-Islamic practices, Muḥammad gave orders to kill the serpent (amara bi-qatlil-aym) even in the midst of prayer,79 even if the believer is in a state of sacralisation (iḥrām), or in
the sacred enclosure of the Meccan sanctuary 80 yet these pre-Islamic cults were only gradually and hesitantly abandoned 81 The ninth-century historian of Mecca and its sanctuary, al-Azraqī (d 222/837), reports on the authority of Ṭalq ibn Ḥabīb that in the first century of Islam a male serpent circumambulated the Kaʿba, the most sacred building of Islam, called the House of God (bayt Allāh), located in the centre of the Great Mosque of Mecca, and when warned by the Muslims that were present, suddenly took to the skies and disappeared:
We were seated with ʿAbd Allāh b ʿAmr b al-ʿĀṣ in the Ḥijr; the sun having come there (the shade having contracted) the assembly rose up, when we beheld the glistening of a serpent which had come out of the gate of the Beni-Shaibah [Banū Shayba] The eyes of the men were raised to look at it; it went the circuit of the House seven times and prayed with two bendings of the body behind the place of Abraham, when we went and said to it, ‘O thou visitor, God has ordained thy blood to be shed, and there are in our land slaves and fools of whose mischief to thee we are afraid?’ It then went away in the direction of the sky and we did not see any more of it 82
Theodor Nöldeke has associated the behaviour of these Muslims with the belief in jinn,83 probably in order to give an explanation for such vestiges of the ancient cults 84 Even so the Prophet Muḥammad insisted on regarding the serpent as

a dream in his Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā which underlines the continued importance accorded to domestic serpents:
If one dreams as if the serpents out of a place have disappeared, there will be an epidemic (of plague), and the mortality in that place will increase, for serpents indicate life 97
Post-Qurʾānic traditions thus portray the (serpent-)dragon as no more than the genius loci, fulfilling solely the function of guardian 98 yet it appears that in spite of official strictures, the cult of the serpent was abandoned only slowly under Islam, while domestic serpents, considered as beneficial jinn in their role as genius loci, continued to be tolerated The traditions also maintain that the Kaʿba, the most famous sanctuary of Islam, was built upon a serpent When Abraham (Ibrāhīm) wished to build the Kaʿba, the Sakīna (the Hebrew shekhīnā, “dwelling,” or “presence,” is usually considered the source for the Arabic sakīna)99 unfolded itself like a snake on the first foundations which had already been laid by Adam or the angels, saying, “Build upon me,”100 “and so he built; hence every Bedouin in flight and every powerful person inevitably circumambulates the sanctuary under the Sakīna’s protection ”101 Al-Ṭabarī expounds on this tradition and describes the serpent as

Did I not crush El’s Darling, Sea? Nor destroy River, the great god?
Nor muzzle Tannin full well? I crushed the writhing serpent, The powerful one of seven heads,
I fought and I inherited gold
Hence by fighting one or more dragons, which apparently guarded the gold, ‘Anat obtained the precious metal Cited after Astour, 1965, pp 291–2 In ancient Greek lore the great dragon (drakōn) who guards some treasure or holy site was an important theme, and either protects its holdings as its own possession or was placed there by the owner of the site as its guardian The subterranean golden apples located in the uttermost parts of the earth in the garden of the Hesperides were guarded by the Nymphs, daughters of Atlas, and the drakōn (Hesiod, Theogony 333–5); the oracle at Delphi was protected by the female dragon (drakaina) Pythōn that was killed by Apollo; the spring at Thebes was watched over by a drakōn killed by Kadmos, and the golden fleece was guarded by a drakōn killed by Medea or Jason Euripides (Herakles 397, tr after Buschor, Munich, 1952) calls the treasure-guarding serpent the “reddish drakōn, the formidable coiled gurdian” Plato notes that owing to his sharp sight, the dragon guards hidden treasures as well as temples and oracles (Phaedrus, 4 20 3–4); cf Merkelbach, “Drache,” RAC IV, 1959, pp 226–7 For post-biblical Jewish sources describing the Genesis serpent as possessing “silver, gold, gems, and pearls,” before the Fall, see Ginzberg, 1909–38, repr 1946 and 1955, vol 1, p 71 The treasure-guarding serpent is also known in Indian lore, such as the fable in the
“a stormy wind with two heads One of them followed the other till it reached Mecca; there it wound itself like a serpent on the spot of the sacred house ”102 The foundation of the Kaʿba is further described as “a wind called the wind Al-Khadjūdj which had two wings and a head like a serpent’s ”103 A similar description is given by Ḥusayn ibn Muḥammad al-Diyārbakrī in his Taʾrīkh al-khamīs in which it is said to possess “two serpents’ heads, one behind the other ”104 Such traditions endow the great serpent with a sacred as well as a mythological character In Islamic tradition, the (serpent-)dragon is thus closely associated with the foundation of the Kaʿba It evidently has not only a mythological or apotropaic function but a sacred character, following the ancient Semitic and Iranian traditions 105 Its supernatural qualities are manifest in the winged and double-headed appearance It is further significant, as Arent Jan Wensinck points out, that in most of the traditions the Meccan serpent is either the Sakīna or a being sent by God, hence “not a demoniac but a divine being ”106 Finally, a madman was said to be supernaturally possessed by jinn (majnūn) 107 At the same time, jinn sometimes endowed men with special knowledge as seems to be implied by the word for the mantic figure of a poet (shaʿīr), who was thought to be endowed with demonic or supernat
ural inspiration The close association of the jinn with serpents is also emblematised in Iranian literature In his romantic epic of the popular legend Laylā wa Majnūn, Niẓāmī of Ganja in Azerbaijan uses ophidian imagery to depict the lovers 108 In particular Majnūn’s serpent-like appearance and his dwelling in a cave or ruin underline the fact that he is possessed by jinn:
There, in that particular ruined place, He is creeping like a serpent over a stone He is insane, in pain and distressed, and like a demon, he is far from the eye of man Due to his wounds, his soul is pierced; the marrow of his bones can be seen 109
c The treasure-guarding dragon
Just as the dragon keeps the wealth of the waters concealed, it also keeps, by implication, guard over the wealth which is concealed in the earth The belief concerning dragons guarding treasures hidden in the earth and the sources of nature’s abundance may be linked with their chthonic nature 110 Within the sanctuary of the Kaʿba in Mecca a deep pit or well was situated, called khizāna (“treasury”), on account of the offerings of jewellery and precious objects that were thrown

into it and preserved there 111 This was probably done with the intention, as Wensinck suggests, of appeasing the god of the netherworld 112 Islamic tradition relates how in the period shortly before the rise of Islam, at a time when the ancient Arab tribes of the Jurhum controlled the Kaʿba, these treasures were stolen from the sanctuary 113 Thereupon, according to the Kitāb Akhbār Makkah (“Book of Information on Mecca”) assembled by al-Azraqī, the ninth-century historian of Mecca and its sanctuary,114 God sent “a serpent which had a black back and a white belly and a head like the head of a he-goat; this serpent guarded the sacred House [and its treasure] during five hundred years ”115 The serpent is called a “large serpent” and has its dwelling place in the pit of the Kaʿba, where it guards the treasures 116 It is fed by daily food offerings thrown into the sacred pit by the faithful and basks in the sun on the stones of the Kaʿba 117 This is further elaborated in the biography of the Prophet Muḥammad by the Arab author ʿAlī ibn Burhān al-Dīn al-Ḥalabī who writes that “Allāh sent a white serpent with a black head and a black tail and its head was like the head of a he-goat It had to dwell in this pit in order to guard the objects there ”118 Al-Azraqī notes that as a result the treasure of the Kaʿba
held all the votive offerings, including arrows used for divination, jewellery for adorning idols, and gold,119 and also that Muḥammad uncovered a large amount of gold in the well 120 During the preIslamic period, sacred serpents were also known to have guarded the sanctuaries at Nakhla where the cult of the goddess al-ʿUzzā prospered as well as at Dawmat al-Jandal where the god Wadd was served 121 These sacred serpents were also fed at the sanctuaries, often with milk 122 According to the tenth-century Arabic geographer Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad al-Hamdānī (d 334/945–6), a treasure lay hidden near the high mountains Ḥufāsh and Milḥān (Rayshān) in south Arabia Many Arabs sought this treasure but they were always prevented from reaching it by a serpent in the shape of a high mountain which barred their approach 123 The indirect association of the serpent with wealth in the interpretation of a dream is recorded by al-Damīrī in his Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā according to which:
He who dreams of being bitten by a serpent, in consequence of which the bitten part is swollen, will obtain great wealth, for the poison indicates wealth and the swelling indicates an increase in

125 Idem, p 656 It is interesting to compare this with the Zoroastrian practice of taking snake omens as recorded in the New Persian text, the Mār-nāma (“Book of Snakes”) included in the Persian Riwāyats of Dastūr Dārāb Hormazdyār that date from 1679; one of the verse-lines stating, for instance, “If you see a snake on the day of Hormazd, your honour, property and income will increase” See Panaino, 2005, p 79 126 Idem, p 656 127 Tr and ed Mohl, 1838–1878, vol 6, pp 247–9, ll 1037–1045 128 The adjective qara, literally “black,” designates the prime compass point of the north, the place of origin of the Altaic tribes, hence acquiring the meaning “principal,” “chief” (in contrast to other compass points which are also described in terms of colour such as ak (“white”) indicating the south) Cf Pritsak, 1950–5, pp 244–5, 255 Qara was used in the onomastic of the Turkish tribes (for instance, the eighth-century seasonal camp of the eastern Turks, Qara Qum; the Uighur capital from 744 to 840, Qarabalghasun; the southern Uighur capital after 840, Qara Xocho; and the first yuan capital, Qaraqorum) and as an epithet to the names of Xiongnu and Turkic rulers There are also the Qara-Qitai (“Black Qitan”) who after the fall of the Liao empire ruled over nearly the whole of Central Asia from the Oxus to the Altai mountains until 1175 and the Qarakhanids that ruled in the lands of Central Asia straddling the T’ien-shan mountains from the tenth to the early thirteenth centuries It also carries the meaning “strong, powerful” (Kramers, “Ḳarā,” EI2 IV, 572b) as evidenced by its use in personal names of the Islamic period, such as the name of the Artuqid ruler Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Qara Arslan (“black lion”) ibn Dāwūd ibn Suqmān (561/1166–581/1185) 129 Tr Meisami, 1993, p 221
130 Such a lock is featured on a gilded and nielloed silver casket, now in the Treasury of St Mark’s, Venice Thought to have been either in crusader possession (Marshak, 1986, pp 119–20 and n 89, figs 163–7) or the product of a southern Italian or Spanish workshop (Nobilis Officinae, 2005, pp 171–2, cat no 13; Venise et l’Orient, p 123, cat no 93), the casket has been variously dated from the twelfth to the fourteenth century: Anna Schwinger dates it to the twelfth century, or alternatively, proposes it as a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century reproduction (Nobilis Officinae, 2005, p 171, cat no 13), while Boris Marshak (1986, p 435) has suggested to date it to the second half of the thirteenth century Most recently Francesca Leoni has proposed that the casket originates from southern Italy, or possibly Spain, and should be dated to the end of the thirteenth or the early fourteenth century (Venise et l’Orient, p 123, cat no 93; catalogue entry by Leoni) The flat lid is framed at the sides by epigraphic bands in Kufic, flanking two seated musicians whose depiction conforms to the usual Islamic courtly iconography The decoration on the front of the casket includes two large interlaced ornaments each enclosing a central cross-shape, suggesting that it may have been made for the Western market One of the sides depicts a human-headed harpy with a tail terminating in a large dragon head with gaping mouth Of particular note are the three extremely finely worked yet prominent hinges that terminate in two confronted dragon heads, their wideopen mouths touching at the tips The lock, which ends in closely related dragon heads, fastens just above a pair of lion heads 131 In spite of mythologising features that go back to the Pseudo-Callisthenes, it is noteworthy that medieval Islamic authors differentiated between the legendary and
In another interpretation, the dreamer is not bitten by a serpent but merely dreams of a smooth serpent that he can take wherever he likes, which is interpreted as a sign that the dreamer will become wealthy:
If one dreams of possessing a sleek (smooth) serpent which he has taken wherever he likes, [he] will obtain riches and become prosperous 125
Moreover a dream of a black serpent (instead of a smooth serpent) is said to indicate the acquisition of power and governance:
He who dreams of possessing a black serpent will acquire a kingdom and government 126
The motif of a black snake as positive augury also appears in the Shāh-nāma when the young Buzurjmihr, the later minister of Khusraw Anūshirwān, was breathed on by a black snake which was interpreted by his companion who witnessed the scene as a sign that Buzurjmihr would attain a position of great power 127 The association of the colour black with the concept of royalty is interesting and may perhaps be related to the black banner of the ʿAbbasids (black being supposedly the colour of the Prophet’s banner) but could also be a vestige of
conceptualisations that were introduced by the Turko-Mongol dynasties for whom the colour carried exalted associations 128 In his romance Haft Paykar, which was completed in 593/1197, the poet Niẓāmī Ganjawī refers to “dragon-like locks on treasures rested ”129 Surviving examples of such dragon locks are rare 130 However dragon knockers that have a part attached to a door, and another part linked to it by a hinge that may be lifted and used to strike a plate fitted to a door are used to gain entrance to a monument Well-known examples are, for instance, the copper alloy knockers discussed below that adorned the doors of the Great Mosque (Ulu Cami) of Cizre (the former Jazīrat ibn ʿUmar), now in the Türk ve İslam Eserleri Müzesi in Istanbul (figs 82 and 83) The motif of the treasure-guarding dragon appears also in the first part of Niẓāmī’s prose romance Iskandar-nāma (“Alexander Romance”), called Sharaf-nāma (“Book of Honour”) He describes how a certain Balīnūs, whose name is the Arabic version of Apollonius (of Tyana), a renowned sage and magician of the first century ad and author of several handbooks on magic, accompanied Iskandar, represented as an Islamicised Graeco-Iranian hero,131 on his conquest of

Iran Through his talismanic powers Balīnūs helped the king to defeat Āẓar Humā, the powerful priestess of a fire temple, who in the form of a dragon guarded the holy fire, in other words, the treasure of the temple 132 The same motif is extensively used in Niẓāmī’s Haft Paykar, considered in chapter 14, and also in his Laylā wa Majnūn When the news of Laylā’s death reaches Majnūn, he hastens madly to her grave and:
rolls in the same way as a serpent, Or a worm coiling beneath the earth, With a thousand toils, he coiled himself around The grave-stone like a serpent on a treasure 133
Even in her death Majnūn continues to keep watch over the grave of his beloved, Laylā, like a serpent guarding a treasure:
The cavern is always the home of a snake; O Moon, why has the cavern become your residence? I will lament in your cave for you are my beloved; you are the companion of the cave (yār-i ghār), how can I not weep? you turned out to be a treasure in the earth; If you are not a treasure, why are you then thus [in the earth]? Every treasure, which is in a cave, has a serpent upon its skirt I am a serpent which is the sentinel of your grave watching the treasure on your grave 134
Serpents as guardians of treasures are a widely known topos in folk tales, as recorded in the Alf layla wa-layla, for instance the giant fire-spitting serpent guarding Solomon’s magic ring in the story of the adventures of Bulūqiyā inserted into the story of the Queen of the Serpents 135 The story of the Valley of the Diamonds, which recurs in many eastern sources, associates serpents with diamonds It is found in the legend of the Helle
nistic Orient represented by De XII gemmis, the tale of the fourth-century bishop of Constantia (Cyprus), Epiphanius,136 as well as by Pseudo-Aristotle 137 It is retold in the Alexander Romance138 and also recorded by al-Bīrūnī in his Kitāb al-Jamāhir fī maʿrifat al-jawāhir (“Comprehensive Book on the Knowledge of Precious Minerals”),139 by Niẓāmī in his Iskandar-nāma,140 by the Arabian mineralogist Aḥmad al-Tifāshī (580/1184651/1253),141 in the collection of travel narratives of Sindbād in the Alf layla wa-layla142 as well as later in the travelogue of the merchant explorer Marco Polo (c 1254–c 1324) 143 It recounts that in the east on the extreme frontier of Khurasan there is a deep valley in which diamonds lie, guarded by poisonous snakes upon which no man can gaze without dying; however this power endures only so long as the serpents live On his way to India Iskandar, the Dhu ’l-Qarnayn (“two-horned”) of the Qurʾān (sūra 18, 82–98), is said to have ventured into such a diamond pit He outwitted the serpents by holding up mirrors as shields in which the serpents saw their own reflection and died 144 The association of diamonds with serpents may also explain the belief in the toxicity of diamonds first advocated in the Pseudo-Aristotle, which cautions its readers “against taking the diamonds into their mouths, because the saliva of the snakes adheres to it so that it deals out death ”145 The association of dragons with gems is also recorded in Armenian epic lore, as related by the eleventh-century Armenian scholar Grigor Magistros (990–1058) in a letter addressed to prince Tʿornik Mamikonean:
A fish called Azhdahāk (i e , Azhi Dahāka) gave a concubine a huge pearl she took it to the king, who had it set into a crown The king then ordered that the gods be honoured with rich offerings, and that this fish be carven, together

migrations of nomadic peoples from the Eurasian steppes such as the Avars, subjects of the Turks, who fled to the north Caucasus region in 558 and then migrated westwards into the province of Pannonia (which lay to the east of northern Italy), where later waves of Avar migrants continued to join them (cf Pohl, 1988, pp 28–9; Barthold and Golden, “Khazar,” EI2 IV, 1172a) The motif of dragon protomes projecting from vegetal compositions that is found on eighth-century Lombard and Frankish art may thus have been inspired by Central Asian prototypes 149 Rempel’, 1983, p 127, fig 49 5; idem, 1987a, p 103, fig 42a; and idem, 1987b, pl LI, fig 11, altar to the left side 150 Vidēvdāt 18 14–5; Gershevitch, 1959, p 62 In Jewish post-biblical scriptures (Yoma 21a) the crowing of the cock is likewise known to drive demons away, see Ginzberg, 190938, repr 1946, and idem, 1955, vol 5, p 173, n 16 151 Vidēvdāt, Fargard 18 2 14 (The Zend-Avesta, tr Darmesteter, 1880); Bundahishn 19 33 (Sacred Books of the East,

An instance of the association of the serpent with a tree has already been noted in the figure of the Rigvedic primordial “serpent of the deep,” Ahi Budhnyà, which resides at the roots of the tree This may be related to the notion of the giant serpent as custodian of a tree, often represented as stylised vegetation, which became an important iconographical motif, reflected in particular on the decoration of portable objects found throughout the Central Asian regions The prevalence of this theme in these regions is corroborated in the depiction of a fork-shaped harness ornament, datable between the sixth and the eighth centuries, which was excavated from a tomb at Kebinai in southern Siberia (fig 38) The pendant is cast in openwork with paired antithetical dragons emerging from a stylised vegetal composition that springs from a horned mask-like head at the bottom Long-necked regardant dragon protomes with deep-set eyes, lupine or canine snouts and feathery wings, springing from a central foliate stalk and emitting or biting the leaves are shown on a belt fitting serving as hinge joint, cast in openwork The fitting was unearthed in Novocherkassk in the lower Don region and is attributed to the second half of the eighth century (fig 39) 147 A Byzantine attribution has been suggested on the basis that Byzantine workshops are thought to have existed in the proximity 148
In the Central Asian world the iconography is further recorded on a small early medieval ancestral fire altar (chirāgh khāna) from Samarqand 149 The niche, which formed the nucleus of a house, is decorated on both end panels with a stylised tree-like vegetal composition flanked by a pair of perching birds with long florid tails, probably representing peacocks Springing from the trunk of the tree are arched regardant dragons that flank a large central crescent-shaped bracket, above which flutters a pair of small birds (figs 40 a and b) After the destruction of the fire temples following the advent of Islam, these chirāgh khāna, miniature imitations of fire temples, were placed as small altars in private houses for the luminaries that manifest the presence of the eternal fire A small fire was lit in the niche, the denomination chirāgh khāna translating as house of the lamp, in other words a domestic “fire temple ” Together with the dragons that spring from the central tree this altar contains images of roosters The rooster motif is a well-known visual element harking back to Sasanian and early Islamic iconographies The idea of the rooster (Av parō. dərəs-, “he who foresees [dawn]”) as a sacred bird or a bird endowed with special powers was characteristic of Iranian beliefs In the Avesta it is considered as the bird of Sraosha, the angel who defends mankind from demons 150 Generally in Zoroastrianism it is regarded as an ally of the powers of light and goodness, as an enemy to evil and demonic beings, and as a symbol of royalty and true religion; thus in the Vidēvdāt Ahura Mazdā says of the rooster:
That bird lifteth up his voice at the mighty dawn (saying), ‘Arise, O men, laud Best Righteousness, contemn the demons’ 151

fullfilling jewel of the Indian nāgas, which symbolises transcendent wisdom See Schafer, 1963, pp 181, 243 For the reception of the motif consisting of three points surmounting two wavy lines, called çintamani in Persian and Islamic art, see Soucek, “Cintāmani,” EIr, and Kadoi, 2006–7, pp 33–49 157 This mural painting, which was taken to Berlin by the German expedition, is presumed to have been destroyed during the bombing of World War II 158 Grünwedel, 1912, fig 590 159 Hill, 1976; cf idem, 1984, p 230 160 Idem, 1976, pp 30–1, figs 14, 15 See also idem, 1984, pp 229–30, fig 12 2 for the design of the water machinery from Archimedes 161 Idem, 1984, p 230
In antiquity, the religious significance of the cock as sacred bird of the sun whose rising he announces is described by the second-century Greek geographer Pausanias 152 In medieval Islam it was similarly associated with light and Paradise, as well as with royalty, but also with the magicianking Sulaymān ibn Dāwūd who was acquainted with the speech of birds and animals (Qurʾān 27, 16–9) 153 In his Kitāb ʿajāʾib al-makhlūqāt al-Qazwīnī notes a prophetic ḥadīth according to which God placed under the divine throne a rooster whose wingspan extended from east to west At the approach of dawn the rooster would beat his wings and cry out loud: “Glory to God, the Almighty!” At this all the roosters in the world would respond in similar fashion, praising God by beating their wings and crowing 154 A similar type of imagery as the one on the chirāgh khāna can also be found in a Buddhist context in Chinese Turkestan (present-day Xinjiang) When the near one-hundred-year steppe empire of the Uighurs in Mongolia (744–840), which had essentially been a continuation of the Turkic qaghanate, was destroyed in 840, one group fled westward into the region of Chinese Turkestan, where they ultimately founded two kingdoms Here the Uighurs became the culture bearers of Central Asia 155 On a wall painting from Cave 19 in Uighur Bezeklik in Qocho (present-day Turfan), datable between the ninth and the eleventh centuries, a pair of dragons in “Central Asian Chinese-style” springing from a water pool are closely associated with abundant vegetation The confronted snarling dragons ascend in upright position, their tail ends entwined Dramatically presented with their raptor-like legs raised and extended talons unsheathed, they guard between them a treasure, shown springing from the lotus throne and floating over a flaming pearl, the Buddhist ruyi baozhu (Skr cintāmaṇi),156 from
which sprout the formidable, profusely reticulated branches of a tree Its luxuriant growth is nourished by the fructifying waters of the pool in which small dragons cavort (fig 41) 157 A pair of knotted dragons features in a related depiction of the same period from a now destroyed wall painting, also from the cave monastery of Bezeklik, recorded only by a drawing made by the German archaeologist Albert Grünwedel during the third German expedition to Chinese Turkestan in 1906 to 1907 (fig 168) 158 A similar conceptualisation of the dragon and the tree is emblematically portrayed in an Islamic context as part of a large water-clock automaton It is described in an illustrated horological treatise attributed to Archimedes of which several medieval Arabic versions survive 159 The second section of this treatise gives an account of a tree with silver birds set between two mountains behind which serpents hide:
We will now describe how a tree is made, upon whose branches are birds This tree is to be fixed vertically between two mountains, with a fingerlength between each mountain and the stem of the tree When an hour elapses then a snake emerges from a hole in the mountain’s foot The hole is inside the floor of the tree or opposite the birds that are on the branches of the tree When the two snakes emerge the birds shriek and whistle as long as the snakes are visible Then the snakes go back inside their holes and the shrieking and whistling of the birds ceases 160
While parts of the Pseudo-Archimedes treatise are first mentioned in Islamic sources of the tenth century, this type of clock seems to belong to a much earlier tradition and was known to have been built in Sasanian and Byzantine times 161 During the medieval Islamic period, automata in the form of silver gilded trees with artificial singing birds were known as expressions of imperial



dragons and the powers of the earth 65
162 The wonders contained in the newly built caliphal palace, such as an automaton in the form of trees, are reported in al-Khātib’s account in the History of Baghdad of the arrival of Byzantine ambassadors to the ʿAbbasid capital in 305/917–18 They described seeing a silver tree in a large pond with silver or gilded whistling birds perched on its branches Idem, p 205 and n 17 163 In the Byzantine treatise of “The Throne of Solomon” in Constantinople, the throne of the emperor is depicted as surrounded by automata which included a jewel-encrusted tree with artificial singing birds, roaring lions and moving beasts, a description which is corroborated by Liutprand, Bishop of Cremona, who visited Byzantium as envoy in 336/948 and again in 355/966 Cf idem, p 205 The tree stood in the chrysotriclinium before the emperor’s throne; outside there was a fountain with a silver eagle that covered the conduits by holding a serpent in its talons Ebersolt, 1923, pp 55–7 See also Soucek, 1997, p 405 and ns 13–8 with further references

might, particularly in ʿAbbasid times;162 slightly later they are also recorded as having surrounded the throne of the Byzantine emperor 163 The motif of the tree with serpents is rendered on a two-dimensional medium, a polychromeenamel overglaze-painted ceramic bowl (so-called mīnāʾī ware) from Rayy, datable to the second half of the twelfth century Here a central tree springs from a small mound at the base of the bowl At mid-section the tree trunk is separated by a mound-like conical motif around which a dragon appears to be coiling and from the tip of which emerges the giant upward oriented gaping jaws of a dragon with bifid tongue The trunk grows out of this creature’s maw into a treetop with lush foliage topped by a pair of perched birds The scene is flanked on either side by a rider and in turn by a figure seated cross-legged (fig 42) 164 An analogous motif is represented by the wellknown relief sculptures that decorate the stone minaret buttresses of the Çifte Minare madrasa at Erzurum, probably built just before the fall of the city to the Mongols in 640/1242–3 165 Set within an ogival arch-shaped niche surrounded by a triple torus frame, the composition was intended to appear at either side of the main entrance of the madrasa, but only the relief to the right was completed 166 The sculptures are carved to form a pair of dragon protomes that spring from the stem of a central palm tree with a double-headed eagle at its summit (fig 43) 167 The scaly upward-curving serpentine necks extend into large, upward oriented heads with large, almond-shaped eyes and small, pointed ears, their open jaws with outward curled tips replete with rows of teeth and tongues with bifid tips Just behind the heads, the slender necks are embellished with guilloche chains, a feature
they share with the dragons that flank a central bovine head on the city walls of Ani (fig 130) and the dragons that frame the large, composite star-rosette from Konya (fig 154) The dragons’ curving ophidian bodies are once looped, then join to grow upwards into the stemmed vegetation above, while an inverted stemmed palmette springs from the interstice created below the point of juncture of the bodies Out of the large, crescent-shaped bracket which encloses the stem grow eight large “palmate” leaves that fan out symmetrically and bear what appears to be fruit, probably pomegranates; on the tips of the side fronds (second leaves from the bottom) perch small birds The pomegranates, anomalous in the context of a palm tree, link the tree with the idea of fertility and immortality – both in itself and as a dwelling place for birds Öney interprets the dragons as chthonic symbols (in contrast to the solar/light symbol of the double-headed bird) which guard the tree 168 Similarly, Otto-Dorn reads this form of imagery in the light of astrological lore, according to which the dragons threaten the luminaries represented by the crescent-shaped bracket and the doubleheaded eagle 169 The serpent at the foot of the tree seems to have been a well-known conceptualisation in medieval Islam, as is evidenced by a saying recorded by the fourteenth-century encyclopaedist al-Damīrī and attributed to ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, a contemporary of the Prophet Muḥammad, in which he compares himself to the serpent at the foot of the tree:
I support [equally well] good and evil, and am inexorable, Like the serpent at the foot of the trees 170

171 Ed Dahhān, S , Damascus, 1959, pp 127–8 (fol 4 206 wāw), as cited in Montgomery, 2006, p 72 172 A reference to the tree is also found for instance in the Proverbs of Solomon: “A Tree of Life is wisdom for those who acquire it” (3 18) On the meaning of the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life, see Agathangelos, Teaching of St. Gregory, tr and ed Thomson, 1970, ch 277; The Armenian Commentary on Genesis Attributed to Ephrem the Syrian, tr Mathews, 1998, pp 21–2, 27–8, 32–3, 37 and n 116, 39; see also Wallace, 1985, pp 101–32 173 I am grateful to Professor Robert Hillenbrand for pointing this out to me 174 For a closely related example, see British Library Ms Add 15,411, fol 92a, dated 1321, which is also illustrated at the monastery of Gladzor in southern Armenia by Tʿoros
Taronatsi; see The Christian Orient, 1978, pl 13 (caption 119) The same conceptualisation can be observed in an eleventh- or twelfth-century Georgian illustration of the Gospel book from Ghelati near Kutaisi in northwestern Georgia which shows a tree-like composition from the base of which projects a root-like vertical extension that carries a single curved serpent with gaping mouth revealing a bifid tongue Georgia, Tbilisi, Institute of the Academy of Sciences of Georgia, Ms A 908, fol 16; see Amiranašvili, 1966, fig 35 175 Rogers, “Saldjūḳids,” EI2 VIII, 936a 176 For another closely related vishap-type khatchkʿar with small crosses issuing from the gaping dragon heads, see Armenië, 2001, p 52, photograph, lower left side, third khatchkʿar from the left
The close associtation of the tree and the serpent is also evident in the Risālat of Ibn Faḍlān, secretary of the caliphal mission to Volga Bulgaria from 309/921 to 310/922, that relates the story of a tree being cut to size which then begins to move and crawl away in the form of a giant dragon 171 Given the historical relations of Armenians with the principality of Erzurum (Karin), which at various times belonged to Armenia and under Islamic rulership also had a Christian Armenian population, it is interesting to relate the Çifte Minare madrasa motif to earlier as well as contemporary Armenian references preserved in manuscript illumination A significant variant on the imagery is presented in a collection of sermons of 1216 illustrated by Barsegh Kʿahanay (the priest) in Skevra monastery, Cilician Armenia (fig 44) It portrays a tall multi-branched tree bearing large foliage, buds and fruit that are pecked at by different types of birds that perch on the branches yet instead of growing out of the base of the tree and rearing up from there, the interlaced slender trunks of the tree are here shown to be enclosed by an entwined pair of giant scaly serpents forming a double loop The motif represents an example of the standard depiction of the tree or pole together with the serpent forming the figure of eight (both open and closed) as also repesented in the symbol of the caduceus (kerykeion) discussed below The reptiles gnaw, with heads upreared, at the uppermost leaves A small bird is perched on the summit of the tree while a pair of confronting human-headed birds, probably harpies, flanks the base of the trunk The latter bears an intricate interlace terminating in pendant palmette-shaped buds The tree-withserpents motif certainly alludes here to a complex of ideas, not least the serpent and the fruit-bearing tree in the Garden of Eden 172 Painted about three decades before the construction of the Çifte
Minare madrasa, the miniature thus documents a variation of the motif in a Christian context 173 A large marginal ornament from an Armenian Gospel of Luke illuminated in 1323 shows openmouthed dragons with projecting tongues that touch the base of a more stylised, tree-like vegetal motif The latter contains the symbols of the four Evangelists set amidst foliage that tapers to an arched apex It is surmounted by an ornate cross flanked by clusters of grapes instead of the birds that top the tree-like compositions on the collection of sermons of 1216 and the mid-thirteenthcentury Çifte Minare madrasa The ornament was illustrated by the miniaturist Tʿoros Taronatsi in the important scriptorium of the monastery of Gladzor in southern Armenia (fig 45) 174 In view of the close analogies between the dragon compositions on the façade of the Çifte Minare madrasa and contemporary Armenian stone carvings, Rogers has referred to the reliefs as “barely islamicised versions of Armenian khatchkʿars (commemorative cross-stones) ”175 This is particular evident on vishap-type Armenian Christian sepulchral steles or commemorative cross-stones (khatchkʿar), such as a twelfth- or thirteenth-century example from Makravankʿ in Ararat province, on which a closely related form of imagery can be deduced On this khatchkʿar a pair of stylised dragons springs from the base of a cross, whence their serpentine bodies bifurcate, form a loop and then curve upwards to terminate in stylised heads with wide-open jaws Just below the heads, ornamental bands enclose collars in the form of a figure of eight which accent the ophidian necks and delineate the bodies, the latter being enlivened by parallel decorative stripes The bases of the small crosses are shown to rest on the tips of short tongues projecting from the dragons’ mouths whose lips end in inward-curling tips (fig 46) 176

It is notable that khatchkʿar decorated with the cross, the “Sign” of God or “Wood of Life,” as the main decorative motif, symbolise primarily the salvation of the souls of the departed in whose memory they were erected 177 In the case of vishap-type khatchkʿar it appears therefore less likely that the dragons are shown ingesting the crosses and it may be presumed that, conversely, the mythical creatures are represented as deliverers and as givers of fecundity and prosperity The visual conflation of dragon bodies with knotted ornaments is perhaps indebted to the canon-tables of Armenian Gospel books 178 An important marginal ornament features a cross resting on an inverted heart-shaped interlace of split-palmettes which evolves into two confronted dragon heads, the necks enclosed in narrow ornamental collars Just as on the vishaptype khatchkʿar discussed above, the creatures are distinctly portrayed with their tongues darting from the wide-open mouths to touch the base of the cross (fig 47) The ophidian heads are capped by pointed ears, the most characteristic aspect being however the wide open, curved snouts, the upper lip ending in a rolled-up tip The ornament is portrayed on Mark’s first page, copied by the priest Hohannes [sic], son of the priest Manuk, in 1171 in Edessa (now known as Urfa) in southeast Anatolia 179 The rendering of the dragons on the vishaptype khatchkʿar as well as the Edessan marginal ornament reveals analogies with the arch-shaped double-headed knotted dragons with wide-open jaws, pointed ears and horn-like protuberances, the bodies covered with an interlaced palmette scroll, that are featured on some of the funerary steles at the vast cemetery of Akhlāṭ The latter is situated at the northwest corner of Lake Van between Eski Akhlāṭ and the Ottoman qalʿa and was principally erected between 1250 and 1350 (figs 48 and 49) 180 The points of resemblance are noted by Rogers who hypothesises that the overall decoration of the richly carved tombstones, some
of which become highly stylised,181 “was a reaction to the traditional decoration of Armenian khatchkʿar ”182
Representations that associate the dragons yet again with the Christian cross are moreover found at the monastery of Deir Mār Behnām in Mosul On the lintel of the southern outer door, just below the relief-carved representation of a pair of entwined dragons (figs 17a and b), examined above, is a central Greek cross From its base extends an arched cartouche which encloses a pair of stylised regardant quadruped dragons viewed from behind, whose arched bodies are crossing (fig 50) 183 The dragons’ gaping mouths and their projecting tongues touch the tip of the cusped lower end of the cross An interesting parallel occurs on the portal leading to the chapel of the baptistery at Mār Behnām, where the frame is carved with a knotted serpentine moulding forming ogee arch-shaped niches which also enclose crosses whose lower ends extend into stemmed palmettes An important khatchkʿar in the church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) in Sevanavankʿ, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Sevan in the eastern Armenian province of Gegharkʿunikʿ, depicts the scene of God expelling Adam and Eve from Paradise flanked by a pair of dragons with knotted tails and open mouths revealing the tongues (fig 51) It is interesting to note the early rabbinic assessment of the association of Adam and Eve with the serpent: “the serpent is your [sc Eve] serpent and you are Adam’s serpent ”184 yet for its role in the fall of Adam and Eve, God condemned the serpent forever to eat “earth” (Genesis 3 14) However rather than being portrayed as evil, it is once again shown to touch the bottom tip of the long cross held by God in his right hand with its projecting tongue 185 This ambiguity inherent in the figure of the serpent(-dragon) is elucidated in a passage from the Epistle of Barnabas in which Moses says:

192 With regard to the Christian Feast of the Apparition of the Flaming Cross in Heaven, al-Bīrūnī records that, according to Christian scholars, Constantine’s mother, Helena, went to Jerusalem to find the cross of Christ which when placed upon a dead body could resurrect the dead He further notes that the wood used for the cross is referred to as “the wood of Paeonia,” which is frequently “attached to a man who suffers from epilepsy, being considered as a symbol of the resurrection of the dead” (Kitāb al-Āthār, tr and ed Sachau, 1876–8, pp 293–3) For related narratives on the association of the Cross and the Tree of Life, see Wünsche, 1905, pp 15–7 193 See the Homily by David Anyaghtʿ, cited in Russell, 2004, pp 630 and 1194 In Agathangelos’ fifth-century theological teachings, Teaching of St. Gregory, the cross is praised as a “Tree of Life rooted in the earth” (tr and ed Thomson, 1970, pp 7–9, 21–3, and chs 577–86, 618–31) On the cult of the Tree of Life in Armenia, see Russell, 1987, p 33 The Tree of Life as prefiguration of the Cross of Christ is mentioned in the Christian Syriac Meʿārath gazzē (Cave of Treasures, tr and ed Budge, 1927, p 34) 194 Cf Teaching of St. Gregory, tr and ed Thomson, 1970, pp 159–62, and chs 641–54
Whenever one of you, he said, be bitten, let him come to the serpent that is placed upon the tree, and let him hope, in faith that it though dead is able to give life, and he shall straightway be saved
In the Armenian apocryphal tradition a promise was made to Adam at the expulsion that he will be restored as ruler of Paradise after the Second Coming, an event which may be implied in the carving with the giant serpents appearing to guard the gates of Paradise At least from the beginning of the fifth century, the cross was regarded as a powerful amulet,186 hence in the early Christian period crosses placed on or near entrances served primarily protective and apotropaic functions 187 The Christian cross together with the dragons thus undeniably has a special function as an apotropaion guarding a threshold The association of the dragon with the cross may be related to the symbol of the serpent as it appears in the Gospel of John (3:14):
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
In his homily on the Gospel of John, the fourthcentury archbishop of Constantinople, John Chrysostom (c 347–407), similarly compares the “lifting up” of the serpent with the manner of Jesus’ death and parallels the Christ himself with the likeness of the serpent:
In the former, the uplifted serpent healed the bites of the serpents; in the latter, the crucified Jesus healed the wounds inflicted by the spiritual dragon In the former, there was the uplifted brass fashioned in the likeness of a serpent; in the latter, the Lord’s body formed by the spirit 188
The tenth-century polymath al-Bīrūnī, one of the most eminent literary and scientific figures of the medieval Islamic period, records a Christian source which also relates the brazen serpent to the cross:
God ordered the Israelites to make a serpent of brass and to hang it on a beam, which was to be erected, for the purpose of keeping off the injury done by the serpents when they had become very numerous in the desert Now from this fact they infer and maintain that it was a prophecy and a hint indicative of the Cross (of Christ) 189
Correspondingly, as Hans Leisegang asserts in his discussion of the Epistle of Barnabas,190 the serpent lifted up by Moses is characterised as a representation of Jesus, an identification that became an established motif in Christian symbolism, and the counterpart of the satanic serpent in Paradise 191 At the same time, the multivalent aspect of the symbol of the cross, employed as metaphor for both the crucifixion and the resurrection192 of Christ, has to be taken into account In Armenian exegetical works the khatchkʿar is often elaborated as “Wood of Life” (pʿayt kenats) 193 The equation of the “living” cross with vegetation194 provides an

one of the panels includes a winged and horned quadruped with a long gaping snout which may be recognised as a quadruped dragon (Bombaci and Scerrato, 1959, fig 12; Baer, 1965, fig 83) The fabulous creature is rendered just below a similar such quadruped which however is distinguished by a bird’s beak and small pointed ears and thus clearly typifies as a griffin 199 Pinder-Wilson, 1997, pp 346–7, cat no 215 200 See Strzygowski, 1916, p 214, fig 180 (outer vertically-oriented plaques) 201 Doublures of two sections of a 30-part Qurʾān from Anatolia or the Jazīra, dated to the mid-thirteenth or fourteenth century The Nasser D Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, London, inv nos QUR433 and QUR132 Pinder-Wilson, 1997, p 342, fig 11
analogy to the dragon’s inherently close relation with vegetation and the associated beneficial qualities of fertility/fecundity This in addition to the shared special apotropaic functions naturally accords the dragon the preeminent position of a vehicle that issues, thus perhaps wittingly emits or, by extension, one may hypothesise, delivers, and henceforth protects the “living” cross
*** yet another manifestation of symmetrical dragon heads is found in an embroidery on cotton ground from the greater Khurasan region, now in a private collection Here the motif is takes the form of addorsed symmetrically arranged monster heads with tall floppy ears springing from a central vegetal composition, probably representing a conventionalised tree motif visualised as stylised plant The necks of the creatures extend into the “branches of the tree” in such as way that the bodies are fused with the scrolls The textile has been radiocarbon dated to the thirteenth or fourteenth century (fig 52) In his ground-breaking article on “pseudo-planetary nodes” in Islamic art, written in 1938, Hartner has identified these monster heads with long ears growing from scrolling tendrils as “the dragon progeny threatening the luminaries or, vicariously, their domicilia and exaltations ”195 However, he qualifies the astrological interpretation by suggesting that “in all probability, various elements – astronomical, astrological and mythological – were here fused in one ”196 The iconography of the “inhabited scroll” which includes not only dragon heads, but other animal as well as human heads is ubiquitously applied specifically on late eleventh- to early thirteenth-century works of art, in particular metalwork, from Western Central Asia, especially the greater Khurasan region 197
The long-eared dragon heads are also a common feature on contemporaneously dated press-moulds, most of which have a Khurasani provenance Ralph Pinder-Wilson hence identifies these scrolls as having their origin in Khurasan, first occurring on marble reliefs, attributed to one of the Ghaznawid palaces (perhaps of Masʿūd III (r 492/1099–508/1115) or Bahrām Shāh (r 511/1117–552/1153) or of a later date) excavated at Ghazna by the Italian Archaeological Mission to Afghanistan 198 Spiralling tendrils transforming into dragon- and other mythical heads are figured on a mould which bears a dedicatory inscription to a Ghurid general and governor of Herat, ʿIzz al-Dīn Ḥusayn ibn Kharmil (d 607/1210–1) 199 Openwork gilded silver plaques found in the valley of Kotchkar in the Semirechye, now in the State Hermitage in St Petersburg, are further examples of vegetal scrolls inhabited with the monster and animal heads, among which the dragon is prominently represented 200 Rinceaux with such heads also form the all-over decoration on the doublures of a Qurʾān from Anatolia or the Jazīra, datable to the mid-thirteenth or fourteenth century 201 This ornamenting of the doublures of the sacred book of Islam with vegetal scrolls from which spring mythical and naturalistically rendered zoomorphic heads offers an interesting parallel to the practice, evidenced in Ilkhanid Anatolia, of decorating the façades of sacred architecture, such as mosques and madrasas, with such “inhabited scrolls ” A more detailed discussion of this can be found below in the Epilogue The wide distribution of the motif is, moreover, attested by its representation throughout the Caucasus region, such as on an archivolt fragment from Daghistan in the eastern Caucasus It is carved with a vivid depiction of a mighty winged dragon pursuing a slender cervid, the

inner edge being framed by a rinceau terminating in gaping dragon heads with projecting tongues (figs 63 and 53, detail) 202 The dragon’s vegetal affiliation, conveyed through its repetitive projection from the foliate bends, was presumably not merely decorative, intending rather to underline the associated, apparently positive and beneficial, semantic meaning of the visual expression During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, rinceaux that evolve into gaping dragon heads and protomes also figure in Armenian miniature painting, the earliest dated examples of the motif appearing in marginal ornaments of the famous so-called Homiliary of Mush executed on parchment leaves at the monastery of Avagvankʿ near Erēz/Erznga(n) (present-day Erzincan)203 in northeastern Anatolia between 1200 to 1202 (figs 126–129, 131–133) The fusion of a winged dragon’s body with the leafy branches is also shown in a headpiece in the same manuscript, which is further discussed below The hind parts of the mythical creatures are transformed here into vegetal scrolls, thereby highlighting the emergence of two confronted dragon protomes with forelegs, the necks are again enlivened by ornamental collars (fig 61) A more detailed rinceau appears in a headpiece of a later manuscript, copied in the scriptoria of Sis, the capital of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, in 1274, which had a princely sponsor, Marshal Oshin, son of Kostandin of Lambron and queen Keran’s uncle It features on the first page of the Gospel of Luke and is filled with an animated all-over foliate interlace “inhabited” by animal and human heads among which the dragon is prominently represented For the most part the stems are issuing from animal and dragon necks, the tips of the wideopen dragon jaws, and the pointed tips of the tight-fitting headdress worn by the human heads The headpiece is crowned at the apex by a foliate interlace in the form of an inverted heart-shape from which project two large, confronted dragon heads whose gaping jaws reveal the tongues that touch the upper edge of the headpiece and whose lower jaws extend into split-palmettes that curve along the same edge (fig 54)
In another version of the dragon’s association with vegetation, rather than vegetation sprouting dragon heads or dragon bodies growing into or out of vegetal stems, the mythical creature itself issues vegetation This is represented on a Samanid-period bowl excavated near Tashkent, Uzbekistan, featuring a sketchy composition of a stylised rider with large, round head and raised hands mounted on a recumbent dragon, from whose elongated open snout and hindquarters sprout two twigs of undulant foliage (fig 55) 204 The iconography of the dragon as producer of vegetation is further exemplified by two analogous depictions on the arched handles of the two celebrated silver- and copper-inlaid copper alloy buckets, cited above, both preserved in the State Hermitage, St Petersburg The loops of the handle of the so-called Bobrinski bucket (inscribed with the date muḥarram 559/December 1163) are fashioned out of dragon protomes enlived by a spotted pattern From the open mouths springs (a devouring interpretation may be presumed to be incongruous) the four-sided arched section inscribed on two sides in naskhī with benedictory inscriptions and on the top band of the handle in Kufic with the date muḥarram 559/December 1163 On the outside the mythical creatures are flanked by leaping lions (fig 56) The so-called Fould bucket (signed by its maker, Muḥammad ibn Nāṣir ibn Muḥammad al-Harawī, and recently attributed to early thirteenth-century Jazīra, northern Syria, or possibly Anatolia) has a handle that is similarly held in place by loops in the form of arched dragons topped at the outside by projecting lionheaded knobs From the dragons’ open mouths emerges the six-sided arched handle, decorated on all facets with scrolling foliage in place of the benedictory inscriptions of the Bobrinsky handle On either side of the handle the foliage gives way to lion heads that frame a square link inlaid with a composite quadripartite interlaced knot at the apex (originally topped by a now lost finial) (fig 57) 205 yet another aspect of the dragon’s relation with vegetation is shown in the Eastern Christian world in the eleventh-century Georgian church

206 Composite vine scroll friezes bearing grapes and sometimes also pomegranates frequently appear on the façades of tenth-century Armenian and Georgian churches, the most prominent example being the Bagratid church of the Holy Cross of Aghtʿamar (915–921) at Lake Van where in addition to bands of pomegranate framing the exterior window arches, two continuous vine friezes circumscribe the exterior of the church Cf Der Nersessian, 1965, pp 11, 25, pl 31 The pomegranate is one of the symbols of the Iranian fertility goddess Ardvī Sūrā Anāhitā (Mid Pers Anāhīd, Grk Anaïtis) who was venerated by the Armenians that shared the religion of the Persians and the Medes See Soudavar, 2003, pp 58, 74, pl 165, fig 71 For an example of comparable
decoration on Georgian churches, see the tenth-century church of the Virgin in Martʿvili; Mepisaschwili und Zinzadze, 1987, p 160, fig 234 Of note is further the description of the holy garment decorated with pomegranates and bells which was ordered by Moses in Exodus 39 Much earlier examples of these motifs are portrayed in the carved decoration of the church of Saint Polyeuktos (c 524–527) in Constantinople (Istanbul) featuring, for instance, the combination of pomegranates and split palmettes on a modillion or a vine growing out of a vase on a column capital Cf McKenzie, 2006, pls 559, 567 According to Genesis (9:20), the Tree of Life was probably the stem of a vine
of Çengelli, located near Kağizman in the steep mountains that soar above the Aras valley, southwest of Kars, curiously placed within a formerly Armenian community Inside the church the northern capital is carved in relief with a recumbent looped serpent portrayed with upstretched head which reaches towards a cluster of grapes suspended just above its gaping mouth (fig 58)
The head is capped by a pair of small, cusped ears and the upper lip of the elongated snout terminates in the curled-up tip characteristic of the “Saljuq-type” dragon The other face of the capital features the relief sculpture of a composite tree bearing pomegranates and bunches of grapes, both kinds of fruit generally carrying paradisical associations 206

biting with an elongated snout into the feline’s neck, who in turn mauls the mythical creature’s shoulders The densely patterned fur of the felid and scaly hide of the fabulous beast are finely contrasted (fig 59) 3 This type of imagery has been interpreted as a classical metaphor of the dragon as eclipse symbol swallowing the lion, symbol of the Sun (the zodiacal sign of Leo is known as the house of the Sun) 4 It is moreover generally assumed that the creature emerging victorious from the combat would assimilate some of the essential qualities of the vanquished party; in this case the dragon perhaps absorbing qualities attributed to the lion such as bravery, courage and magnanimity as well as ferocity, voraciousness and wildness A comparable spirit seems to pervade the dragon reliefs preserved from the now destroyed city walls of the Saljuq capital Konya (618/1221), now in the İnce Minare Müzesi in Konya The dragons’ expansive knotted tails curve upwards and terminate in small dragon heads with open mouths that appear to grasp or attack the tails, hence visually conflating two dragons (fig 60) 5 The influence of the bestiaries that populated the imaginary world of the medieval period perhaps stimulated the visual fusion of two or more animals, often of a different type, a common feature
a The dragon in animal combat scenes
Ancient Near Eastern animal motifs such as the theme of combatant animals figure prominently in the decorative repertoire of the medieval Islamic period Animal combat scenes also appear to reflect the visual language of so-called Steppe Empire Eurasian “animal style” art 1 Dragons locked in combat with each other or with other real or imaginary creatures played a particularly significant part in the artistic vocabulary of many Eurasian pastoral peoples This ancient iconographical theme of animal combat, in which the dragon is pitted against another animal, continues to appear in both Islamic and Christian contexts A fluidly rendered representation, evoking the immediacy and innate animal nature intrinsic in wild beasts, is found in a twelfth- or thirteenth-century openwork decoration of a brazier from the Iranian world or Anatolia The scene depicts the combat of two exceedingly fierce and powerful creatures, a feline quadruped with a quadruped dragon 2 The latter has an elongated ophidian body tapering to the tip of a long tail and is twisted around the entire body of its striding adversary, beginning at the right hind leg, circling the body once, and then the neck, re-emerging behind the feline’s head,

6 This depiction may be an allusion to vishap-a-kagh, a term employed in Armenian legend (from vishap and kagh, the latter meaning “male goat,” hircus) It may be associated with the god Vahagn of the ancient Armeno-Parthian pantheon who bears the epithet vishapakʿagh, “dragonslayer” I am grateful to Rev Dr Vrej Nersessian (personal communication) for elucidating this point Cf IshkolKerovpian, “Vahagn,”WdM IV, 1, pp 149–52, esp p 150

10 Bashkirov, 1931, pl 72; Baltrušaitis, 1929, pl LXVI, fig 107 Anatoli Ivanov (1976) has revised Bashkirov’s twelfth- to fourteenth-century dating of most Daghistan sculpture preserved in the walls of the mosques of Kubachi, on the basis of tombstones from Kubachi and a neighbouring village as well as an inscribed archivolt (fig 133 in the publication) datable to the fourteenth or early fifteenth century However, the archivolt fragment with the dragon and cervid was not part of the group of pieces discussed and published by Ivanov, nor do the carvings of the published tombstones (figs 123, 126, 127, 130, 135, 136) bear any stylistic resemblance to the carving on the fragment (on the basis of the photographs), which is why a twelfth- or thirteenth-century dating still seems justified The contention that most of the reliefs were not made in Kubachi but elsewhere in Daghistan (p 203), is certainly worthy of notice
in the arts of Western Central Asia, particularly from the eleventh to the thirteenth century Often however compositions represent a physically strong animal attacking a weaker one The interesting depiction of an apparent contest between two dragons, hence two fabulous creatures of equal strength, perhaps symbolises the perpetual act of predation An animal combat also appears as part of a bilaterally symmetrical foliate interlace which fills a headpiece in the Mush Homiliary illuminated at the monastery of Avagvankʿ near Erznga(n) between 1200 and 1202 It terminates at one end in the protomes of two confronted winged dragons with forelegs and at the other in two goat heads topped by long curved horns, the latter snapping at the dragon wings while the dragon snouts clinch the goat necks (fig 61) 6 The façades of Armenian churches are similarly adorned with combatant animals, also featuring the likeness of the dragon or giant serpent The bas-relief of a bird in combat with an ophidian dragon is shown over the window on the southern façade of the small twelfth- or thirteenthcentury chapel behind the main church of Surb Astvatsatsin, which forms part of the monastic complex Makaravankʿ in Tavush province, Armenia 7 Here the long serpentine body of the dragon is slung around the neck of the bird that in turn hacks with its large beak at the dragon’s neck (fig 62) 8 A certain archaism of representation displayed in the vividly expressed animal nature of the creatures is preserved in the north Caucasus region – clearly featuring the dragon as antagonistic force in animal combat The depiction echoes the theme of a lion killing a weaker animal which had been current in the Near Eastern and Central Asian world for millennia 9 The portrayal cer
tainly reflects the immediacy of mythic animal combat Used as architectural ornament, the dragon is portrayed as a predatory and voracious creature, mauling another quadruped, presumably a cervid, shown with backward turned head, on an archivolt fragment from Daghistan in the eastern Caucasus (fig 63) 10 The dragon’s head is crowned with slanted cusped ears that are folded to the back, the flame-like mane is composed of four large, contiguous, cusped teardrop shapes that project from the sinuous necks; the slender wing that springs from the haunches is stiffly raised over the back ending in a small curl at the tip The mythical creature is rendered with a pair of muscular forelegs, the inner leg raised as if to attack its prey, while the other balances the weight of the body; its elongated undulating serpentine tail forms a central loop and terminates in a curl
b The dragon and mythical creatures
The visually conflated dragons of the Konya reliefs (fig 60) show that the body of the dragon was itself seen to be subject to mutations Similarly, hybrids resulted from the dragon incorporating parts of other animals and mythical creatures and vice versa other animals and mythical creatures merging with parts of the dragon Most commonly it was the head that was assimilated The multiplex creatures thus juxtapose two principles into a unified being creating a duality, an ambiguity which simultaneously contrasts and fuses two metaphorical principles, as, for instance, the well-known example of the bird and the serpent or dragon representing two eternal antagonists which are discussed in the following The nature of such hybrid beings is frequently associated with transitory or liminal states exemplified in such

11 Body parts of natural and mythical animals could also transform into body parts, mostly the heads, of other animals of the natural world For instance, an eleventh- or twelfthcentury copper alloy incense burner in openwork from present-day Afghanistan in the form of a standing lion has a tail that terminates in a bird head (David Collection, Copenhagen, inv no 48/1981; see von Folsach, 1991, p 44, cat no 30, ill on p 15) Birds whose heads transform into those of hares are found on the cavetto of a twelfth- or thirteenth-century silver-inlaid dish with polylobed cavity from the Khurasan region, in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, inv no OA 6479 (Paris, Musée du Louvre, Département des Antiquités orientales, Section Islamique; Pope and Ackerman, eds , 1938–9, repr 1964–81, p 1315; L’Etrange et le Merveilleux en terres d’Islam, 2001, pp 50–2, cat no 32, (see detail of cat no 32)) 12 Cf Otto-Dorn, 1978–9, pp 130, 136 13 For a discussion of the unicorn-elephant fight, see Ettinghausen’s monograph on the unicorn, 1950, pp 84–91

tales as the Alexander Romance which recount Alexander’s journey to the outer reaches of the earth, the land of darkness, without Sun, Moon or stars, where he meets such mythical creatures Antecedents for dragon head motifs issuing from different zoomorphic junctures, for instance, from the tips of the wings or the tail ends,11 may ultimately be found in the ancient “animal style ”12 The synthesis with the dragon is portrayed on animals from the real and the imaginary realm Among the theriomorphic examples, the dragontailed lion was one of the most common, as will be shown in the following Predominant among the dragon-tailed fabulous creatures from the mythical realm are those usually defined as griffins and unicorns 13 A thirteenth-century relief from the now destroyed fortress in Konya portrays a winged unicorn with prominent dragon tail in pursuit of a bovid (fig 64) 14 Often however the creatures fusing with parts of the dragon were therianthropomorphic beings combining the form of a human with those of an animal Human-headed mythical creatures, generally identified as harpies, sphinxes15 or centaurs, were portrayed with limbs transforming into dragon heads on diverse objects of the Eastern Islamic world A harpy (a human-headed bird) whose florid tail terminates in a large upwardcurving dragon protome with forelegs and gaping mouth serves as finial of an eleventh-century copper alloy incense burner typical of artistic production from the greater Khurasan region 16 A sphinx (a human-headed quadruped, often represented with a female head and the body of a feline, frequently a lion(ess)) and a griffin (a hybrid of a bird and a quadruped), both with their upwardly curving tails terminating in dragon
heads with open mouths that are oriented towards the heads of the fantastic animals, are prominently rendered on a frieze which runs around the body of a twelfth-century gilded and nielloed silver jug from Iran 17 Anatolian examples include architectural manifestations such as the carved reliefs of two winged quadrupeds with dragon-tails, possibly representing a sphinx and a griffin, on the bastion (burç) in the southwest of the city wall of Diyārbakr (Ulu Bandan tower no 31) which according to the inscription was built in 604/1208–09 by the builder (bannāʾ) Ibrāhīm ibn Jaʿfar under the patronage of the Artuqid ruler Nāṣir al-Dīn Maḥmūd ibn Muḥammad al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ (597/1201619/1222) 18 A star tile unearthed during the 1992 excavations of the the now destroyed small palace at Kubadabad (623/1226–634/1237) built by sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I shows a gracefully rendered sphinx marchant, the haloed head in profile turned backwards and the tail ending in a dragon head capped by pointed ears, a wisp of flowing hair at the back of the neck and open jaws revealing the tongue (fig 65) A pair of confronted perched harpies whose upstretched wing tips terminate in dragon heads are found on the türbe of Hüdavend Hatun/Khudāwand Khātūn (712/1312) in Niğde, examined in more detail below (fig 66) An example of a portable object, representing perhaps a fountain head, is the small twelfth- or thirteenth-century pierced copper alloy figure of a recumbent lion-bodied sphinx with a tall crown whose raised curving wings as well as the upward-curling tail end in gaping dragon heads 19 To this dragon-tailed menagerie may be added a dragon-tailed sphinx portrayed to the left of the portal of a caravanserai in the Selim moun

and a bird came a high-flying eagle holding a huge scarlet snake (drakōn) in its talons, alive still, twitching Nor did it give up the fight It struck the one
who held it between chest and neck, twisting backward And he dropped it to the ground, hurting with pain, and it fell in the midst of the army while he gave a cry and flew off down the wind The Trojans shivered to see the shining snake (ophis) which lay among them, a portent from Zeus of the aegis

tains in southern Armenia The mythical creature has a powerful, perhaps bovine, quadruped body structure, topped by a slender neck which supports the frontally depicted human head whose features are no longer identifiable on account of the weathered condition with a prominent threepronged crown-like headdress The creature’s tail curves upward to form a pretzel-like knot terminating above the slender wings with curled tip in a dragon head whose open jaws reveal the protruding tongue According to the Persian inscription on the outside lintel the caravanserai was built in 727/1326–7 whereas the Armenian inscription on the right inside the portal states that it was constructed six or seven years later by Chesar Ōrbēlian and his brothers (fig 67); just like the türbe of Hüdavend Hatun, the caravanserai was erected during the reign of the last Ilkhanid ruler Abū Saʿīd Baḥādur Khān (r 717/1316–736/1335) Hence in contrast to the animal combat in which the victorious antagonist would assimilate some of the essential attributes of the defeated animal, the hybrid examples referred to above amalgamated not only the form but presumably also the nature of the disparate elements, in other words their innate characteristics and attributes This fusion was a conspicuous feature perhaps intended not only to reinforce the visual impact but also to augment the intended effect of a potent symbol It has been shown that one of the most commonly depicted themes is that of dragon heads issuing from the tails or wing tips of real or imaginary creatures some of which may sometimes be identified as one of the constellations visualised as one of the twelve signs
of the zodiac, as discussed below It may be surmised that these depictions, other than those in an astronomical or astrological context, do not have a special astrological connection,20 but reflect a general eastern spirit of ʿajāʾib, akin to that of the western merveille, at the mythical creatures of God’s Creation (al-makhlūqāt) that are thought to exist beyond the limits of the known world This is expressed in visual hybridisations that were particularly pervasive during the twelfth and thirteenth century in the medieval Central Asian world and beyond
c The dragon and the bird
From ancient times the bird and the serpent represented two of the mightiest cosmic entities Their interaction harks back to well-known mythic themes recorded from ancient Mesopotamia,21 Greece22 and India 23 In these archaic accounts a bird is identified with the theft of the elixir of eternal life, whose custodian the serpent would once have been Early Islamic histories, such as Balʿamī’s Tarjumat-i tārīkh-i Ṭabarī, record several stories in which the rooster is considered apotropaic In a passage of the chapter on Gayūmart (Av gaya marətan “mortal life”), the mythical First Man of the Mazdean myth of creation, Balʿamī describes him witnessing the scene of a white rooster victoriously attacking a serpent in the middle of the day and then crowing gleefully Gayūmart thence pronounces the rooster to be an auspicious portent The same chapter notes that contrarily a rooster’s

crowing at night was considered an inauspicious sign Its crowing at such an unusual hour served as a warning that saved Siyāmak, Gayūmart’s grandson (according to the Bundahishn), from being attacked by a serpent 24 Cosmological concepts associating the bird with the serpent are recorded in the Meccan tradition, according to which Allāh sent:
from the cupola of heaven a bird in the form of an ʿuqāb, a bird with a black back, a white breast and yellow claws While the serpent on the wall of the Kaʿba opened its mouth in order to repel the bird, the latter came, caught it by its head and took it to the mountain Ajjād 25
Wensinck interprets this tradition as a reference to the three cosmological powers, “the sun [symbolised] by the bird, the ocean by the serpent, and the earth by its navel, the sanctuary [the Kaʿba] ”26 He further notes that the age-old symbolism of:
the eagle with the serpent in its mouth or between its talons is a striking illustration of the idea of cosmic victory ... Eagle and serpent are the representatives of two of the mightiest cosmic entities, the sun and the ocean 27
yet although birds and (serpent-)dragons are depicted as opposing symbols, the sky and water/ earth, above and below, they are often conjoined into a composite generated from the same stock of concepts and images 28 This visual conflation of the bird with the dragon can be seen in particular on textiles, which due to their portability and high status, were a prime luxury medium for the transmission of a visual vocabulary The motif is exemplified, for instance, on a twelfthor thirteenth-century silk samite fragment from Samangan province in Afghanistan, of elongated rectangular form, featuring pairs of large and stately confronting birds, probably roosters, with prominent combs and florid tails terminating in
dragon heads, which flank elaborately rendered palmette trees (fig 68) 29 Islamic textiles largely survive in relatively good condition because they were included in medieval church treasuries 30 The bird and dragon motif can be found on one such fragment which was preserved in the shrine of Saint Apollinaris at the church of Saint Servatius in Siegburg Dragon heads project from spiralling volutes that emerge from the outer wing tips of a double-headed bird (probably an eagle) with “ears” set within shieldshaped medallions The expressive crested dragon heads are rendered with large, circular eyes and particularly wide-open snouts tapering to pointed tips and revealing the tongue (figs 69a and b) 31 The silk has been attributed by Friedrich Sarre to an Anatolian manufactory, where it might have served as a Saljuq coronation robe,32 and has been dated to the first quarter of the thirteenth century 33 Comparable imagery of the double-headed bird of prey is preserved in architectural ornamentation at the confines of the same cultural sphere The same bird with “dragon-wings” can also be found on either side of the western gateway of the thirteenth-century Great Mosque of Divriği (Diwrīgī), situated on the borders of Armenia and Cappadocia The dragon heads are rendered with elongated wide-open mouths emitting curving, tongue-like foliage, which in turn extends to the outspread wing tips of the double-headed birds (figs 70a and b) 34 The mosque was built in 626/1228–9 (or later) by native craftsmen of Akhlāt (northwest of Lake Van) for the Türkmen Mengüjükid ruler Aḥmad Shāh and his wife, Tūrān Malik, who were under Saljuq suzerainty 35 The epigraphic band above the main portal of the mosque mentions the name and title of ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh, presumably in recognition of his overlordship 36

37 Prinzing and Schmidt, eds , 1997, pp 18–21 38 The extensive range of the repertoire of zoomorphic visual fusions resulting in fantastic beasts on artefacts from the Irano-Turkish region is exemplified, for instance, by birds with the heads of hares, depicted on the cavetto of a twelfth- or thirteenth-century silver-inlaid dish with polylobed cavity See p 75, n 11 39 Cf Akinian, 1930, p 16, fig 7; Prinzing and Schmidt, eds , 1997, p 50, pl VIII

The mutation of the bird into a dragon also occurs in the illuminations of Armenian manuscripts In a marginal ornament in a ninth- or tenth-century missal from Ejmiatsin (“the Onlybegotten descended”) in Armavir province confronted mythical creatures have the bodies of birds, their long necks interlacing to terminate in dragon heads that turn backwards and appear to bite into the upright foliate tail tips (fig 71) Not the heads of the birds but more frequently their tails end in dragon heads as shown in the L’viv Gospel transcribed and illustrated in Cilician Armenia in 1198/1199 37 The eighth of the ten canon tables is framed by birds that are perched on vertically interlaced vines, their tails extending into a spiral from which grow dragon heads crowned by long rabbit-like ears,38 their open mouths revealing tongues with bifid tips that touch the tips of the birds’ beaks (fig 72) 39 In the same manuscript on the opening page of the Gospel of Luke, a pair of long-legged birds flanking the central cross and surmounting the frame of a headpiece are shown in the same posture, their heads turned backwards, the beaks inserted into the open mouths of yet another type of dragon with a scaly body and long pointed ears Importantly this depiction portrays the symbiosis of the entire dragon body with that of the bird, the dragon’s tail tapering towards the bird’s head and extending towards the beak which, held in the dragon’s jaws, closes the loop (fig 73) Similes associating the serpent and the dove are recorded in Agathangelos’ fifth-century literary composition entitled Teaching of St. Gregory, one of the earliest Armenian theological texts, which states that man will learn the wisdom of the serpent, strip off all ephemeral impurities as a serpent sloughs off its skin, and receive the pure simplicity of the dove 40 A comparable feature portraying a fusion of the bodies of the bird and the dragon can be observed on the stone relief above the southern outer door at the monastery of Mār Behnām/Deir al-Khiḍr
Here the upward-curling tips of the tail feathers of the confronted, regardant birds transform into characteristic dragon heads that peck at the tail tips (fig 74) The inverse mutation of the tail or wing ends of dragons transforming into raptorial bird heads is exhibited, for instance, on a copper alloy dragon knocker that was fastened to the wooden door of the Great Mosque (Ulu Cami) of Cizre (fig 83) or the dragon reliefs carved on the now destroyed Talisman Gate (Bāb al-Ṭilasm) in Baghdad (fig 139b), both discussed in the following
d The dragon and the feline
The symbiosis of the dragon with a feline predator, two creatures carrying associations not only of great danger, but of royalty (discussed below in chapter 7), is alluded to in Iranian literature The phenomenon is illustrated in a Shāh-nāma account which describes how Rustam, the chief epic hero of Iran, when fourteen years old, vanquishes in India the sea- and land-dwelling dragon known as Babr-i Bayān Rustam has the slain beast flayed and then makes out of the skin or hide a coat for himself, the babr-i bayān 41 In nature when an animal dies its flesh decays while the skin and hair remain This fact may have given rise to the association of animal hides with special powers The dragon’s skin may be considered to represent the essence of the living beast Being covered with its skin was believed to symbolise the acquisition of this fundamental nature and to induce a transformation of the wearer The babr-i bayān was invulnerable, proof against fire and water and impregnable to any weapon The hero thus wore it before going into battle, placing it above his chainmail tunic which was reinforced by iron-plated armour 42 The babr-i bayān was visualised as either the pelt of a tiger (babr) or that of a leopard (palangīna) 43 The dragon Babr-i

(Benveniste, E , Textes Sogdiens, Mission Pelliot III, Paris, 1940, pp 134–6), as cited in Khāleqī-Moṭlaq, “Babr-e bayān,” EIr Cf Melikian-Chirvani, 1998, p 173 44 It is worth mentioning the analogy to the Greek legend of the pre-eminent hero Herakles, whose exploits included strangling a lion, which could not be slain in any other way because its pelt was invulnerable, and wearing its skin as a coat over his shoulders as though becoming part lion himself 45 The story of “The Slaying of the Labbu” (Cuneiform texts from Babylonian tablets in the British Museum 13 3354; Heidel, repr 1951, pp 141–3) recounts the victory of the god Tishpak over the dragon referred to variously as labbu (Akkadian for “lion”), bašmu and mušḫuššu The latter two are listed as separate members of Tiamat, the personified primordial water-chaos, and her battalions in the Akkadian epic of creation, Enūma Elish (I 121; II 27; III 31,89), of Babylon See Wilson, 2001, pp 30–2 46 Kuwait, al-Sabāh Collection, Dar al-Athar alIslamiyyah, Kuwait National Museum, LNS 2558 J ‘a-x2’ ‘s2’ and ‘t2’; ‘t2’ being entirely covered with reddish corrosion

bayān thus seems to have acquired features of a feline predator endowed with dragon-like characteristics 44 By clothing himself in the babr-i bayān Rustam implicitly signalled his symbolic appropriation of the dragon’s qualities as well as his mastery over the hybrid creature It is of note that such composite animal imagery associating the feline, in particular the lion, with the dragon is also apparent in ancient Near Eastern myth 45 The visual conflation of dragon and feline is expressed in Central Asian art from at least the eleventh century onwards It appears on a matrix from the set of 77 late twelfth-century copper alloy matrices for belt/strap fittings, considered earlier in chapter 3, one of which bears an inscription in the name of the Ghurid sulṭān Ghiyāth al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Sām The matrix is symmetrically cast in relief with a pair of small, addorsed lions couchant These are surmounted by ascending, exaggeratedly long, imbricated tails that interlace in a lozenge-shape before overlapping again at the tip and terminating in disproportionately large, confronted dragon heads The creatures’ open snouts touch at the tips, thus forming another small lozenge, and are crowned by prominent curving horns with curling tips (fig 75) Another small matrix from the same set, with lozengeshaped outline topped by a trefoil finial, features a single seated lion in high relief whose upwardarching tail also ends in a large, horned, snarling dragon’s head with gaping mouth revealing the tongue (fig 76) 46 The conflation of the king of animals, the personification of kingly power par excellence (lion hunting being the prerogative of Islamic rulers), with the dragon presented an apt symbolism for the strap fittings of a royal belt
The iconography of a dragon-tailed lion is also shown on the portal of several thirteenth-century Islamic and Christian monuments located in particular in southeast Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia It appears on the so-called royal door of the monastery of Mār Ḥūdéni/Mār Aḥūdēmmeh in Mosul,47 the monastery of Mār Behnām/Deir al-Khiḍr at the southeast of Mosul (fig 77),48 on the men’s entrance of the Chaldean church49 and on the main portal of the Jacobite church (fig 78),50 both located in Cizre The seated lion is portrayed in profile, the head rendered frontally or in three-quarter view, his long tail winding around the hind legs, under the belly and extending over the back transforming into a dragon’s neck and head The mythical creature is portrayed with a curved horn and gaping jaws, revealing a long tongue with bifid tip entwined at mid-section, snapping at the lion’s back At Mār Ḥūdéni the lion’s tail again forms a pretzellike knot, and at the Jacobite church the dragons’ bifid tongues entwine at mid-section (the same feature can be observed on the addorsed entwined dragons at Mār Behnām, figs 17a and b, 160) Of note is moreover the conspicuous placement and orientation of the dragon-tailed lions towards the opening of the doorways drawing attention to the threshold Similar depictions appear also in the twodimensional medium of manuscript illumination such as in a Gospel book painted by Bartholemew (Bardagh) in the Armenian province of Siunikʿ, in which two confronted lions are seated on the tips of the Armenian initial “Ս” of the first word of Mark’s Gospel (Սկիզբն, the beginning) The two lions represent here the symbol of Saint Mark,51 their heads being rendered in frontal view

at an angle, each with one raised foreleg meeting at the central axis and their ascending tails ending in dragon heads with open snouts revealing long tongues (fig 79) Artistic cross-fertilisation in plastic and pictorial art between Islamic Anatolia and Christian Armenian and Georgian regions is reflected in the depiction on a thirteenth-century relief on the hall portal of Kesikköprü Han (667/1268–9) in central Anatolia It shows a lion in profile with frontally oriented head whose tail curves under its belly and then upwards to terminate in a dragon head just above the back The head with small, pointed ears is oriented backwards to face a long-tailed bird which perches on the lion’s hindquarters and pecks at the dragon’s open mouth (fig 80) 52 This type of imagery with a bird pecking with its beak at the open mouth of a dragon is a recurrent feature in Armenian miniatures (see figs 72 and 73) It is probable that the dragon motif that was seen on the royal silks (parang or parniyān) or their representation on wall paintings in Central Asia, in particular Sogdiana, the later Māwarā al-Nahr of the early Islamic period, and Turkestan became a favoured emblem of royalty, next to the lion and the eagle, on medieval Islamic silks Al-Ḥusayn ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿAlī al-Jaʿfarī al-Rughadī, known as Ibn al-Bībī al-Munajjima (“the son of the “lady,” the astrologer”), who was head of the chancellery of the Secretariat of State at the court of the Rūm Saljuqids,53 relates in his memoirs, al-Awāmir al-ʿAlāʾiyya fī ’l-ūmur al-ʿAlāʾiyya, that after his ascension to the throne,
the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I of Konya followed the ancient custom54 of bestowing lavish gifts upon his emirs amongst which the receiving of robes of honour (khilʿa or tashrīf ) constituted the greatest honour 55 A conflation of dragon and lion can be seen on a royal textile, a silk woven in gold, set against a pink ground, which bears the name of sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh, probably referring to Kay Qubādh I The textile is decorated with circular medallions enclosing a pair of addorsed regardant lions in rampant posture with frontally presented heads from whose open mouths spring volutes that form a central vegetal composition The lions’ curling tail ends transform into dragon heads with wideopen jaws (figs 81a and b) 56 The conjunction of dragon and lion was also used on door handles, which seem to have had a special place in the tradition of southeast Anatolia An example intended for the palace door at Diyārbakr is illustrated in a copy of the celebrated treatise on automata written by the master craftsman al-Jazarī (the nisba pointing to an affiliation with Cizre, also known as Jazīrat ibn ʿUmar), begun when in the service at the court of the Artuqid ruler Nūr al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Qara Arslan (562/1167–581/1185) in the principality of Ḥiṣn Kayfā (Hasankeyf)57 (fig 134) 58 In 577/1181 Nūr al-Dīn was awarded Diyārbakr as fief and transferred his court to the city There al-Jazarī created a monumental door with cast brass plates inlaid with copper and silver for the ruler’s palace,59 now only surviving in draw

ings 60 It consisted of two hinged leaves, each framed with a broad epigraphic band in Kufic containing eulogies of the ruler and fitted with cast copper alloy knockers,61 which are fashioned, according to al-Jazarī’s description:
Then I made for each leaf [of the door] ring [i e a knocker] from cast brass in the shape of two connected serpents, the head of each facing the head of the other Their mouths are open as if they wished to devour the head and neck of a lion This lion’s head and neck are the extension of an iron staple which is nailed to the door The fangs of the serpents are in two holes in the lion’s neck 62
Only a copy of al-Jazarī’s drawing of the door knocker and not the actual device survives However the knockers were much imitated Copper alloy examples of this type as well as brass plaques adorned the wooden doors of the Ulu Cami of Cizre, now in the Türk ve İslam Eserleri Müzesi (fig 82) According to the inscription on the upper panel of the door, it was endowed by the local Zangid atābeg Maḥmūd ibn Sānjar Shāh who resided in Cizre from 604/1208 to 638/1241 63 Hence the Cizre knockers were probably made about two decades after al-Jazarī’s creations 64 In contrast to the drawing of the knocker in the copy of al-Jazarī’s compendium of 602/1206 in which the heads of the dragons that flank the central lion-headed knob (serving as hinge and
attachment to the door) are facing each other, the dragon heads of the Cizre copper alloy knockers are portrayed addorsed, thus with heads turned away from the lion head The dragon heads, rendered with small cusped ears and almond-shaped eyes outlined by curving lines, have characteristic wide-open jaws and a curled tip of the snout They are shown to grasp or attack the small, curved wings which spring from an ornament that curls around their haunches The dragons’ paired forelegs touch at the tips, their scaly ophidian bodies forming a loop at the centre, and tapering to the entwined tail ends from the tips of which spring small raptorial bird heads (fig 83) 65 Several other dispersed examples of near-identical dragonknockers dating from the late twelfth to the early thirteenth century exist in slightly varying sizes 66 The imagery of the dragon guarding a treasure is a central theme in Niẓāmī’s romance Haft Paykar, completed in 593/1197 67 In the same work the poet, who spent most of his life in Ganja in present-day Azerbaijan, talks about “dragon-like locks on treasures rested”68 which may indicate that the dragon knockers designed by al-Jazarī and their counterparts at the Ulu Cami of Cizre and other mosques were part of a well-established iconographic genre which extended far beyond southeastern Anatolia and was well-known in the medieval world 69 As doorknockers the interlaced dragons were fastened to the doors at the entrance

The ingenuity of al-Jazarī was further proven when later in his career he entered the service of Qutb al-Dīn Suqmān (581/1185–597/1201) and began inventing mechanical devices, such as the so-called “elephant water-clock ” This water-clock was amongst the devices originally compiled and illustrated by al-Jazarī, and is shown on a leaf from the Kitāb fī maʿrifat al-ḥiyāl al-handasiyya which was copied by Muḥammad ibn yūsuf ibn ʿUthmān al-Ḥaṣkafī at Diyārbakr, and dated to the end of Shaʿbān 602/about 10 April 1206, now preserved in the Topkapı Sarayı Library in Istanbul (fig 84) “The passage of constant hours,”70 the concept of the ebb and flow of time and the seasons, is indicated by a scale adjusted by a small person seated atop an elephant passant within a tall tower that supports the device Perched on top of the tall domed tower, a bird spins around every half an hour, whereupon the elephant driver strikes his elephant and another figure causes the falcon to release a pebble In his description of the central mechanism al-Jazarī states:
transversely between the centres of the pillars is an axle on which are two serpents, the claws of each one grasping the axle, its tail around the axle like a ring, its head tilted backwards, the mouth open as if to swallow the falcon,71 the edge of the lower lip is touching the front of the castle [the tower], and the upper lip is spread, with the two fangs bared 72
It is interesting to note that the representation of the serpent body coiled around the central pole also has an analogy in ancient Hindu mythology, in which the body of the great cosmic dragon Vāsuki (“Possessor of Treasures”) serves as giant churning rope to rotate Mount Mandara in the well-known myth of the “Churning of the Ocean” (Samudramanthana) which produces the nectar (amṛta) of divine immortality 73 In the course of the story, the demons Rāhu and Ketu become involved, an episode which is discussed below in chapter 8 The motif of the serpent that appears to threaten the birds is based on a related design by an earlier craftsman, acknowledged by al-Jazarī,74 the late eighth-century Pseudo-Archimedes,75 whose work included frequent representations of the dragon on clocks, knockers or as spouts of ewers From this it appears that motifs ultimately derived from Hellenistic sources enjoyed widespread popularity in the medieval Islamic world And although he has suggested no symbolic meaning for his creations, al-Jazarī may well have taken for granted that his audience was well aware of the overall symbolism, in which case the omission is inconclusive The depictions may therefore have well been part of an apotropaic and, perhaps, talismanic tradition On textiles of the early medieval period the imagery of the elephant, the giant among animals, was fairly frequent It has been preserved on several Umayyad76 and Byzantine textiles77 made in imitation of late Sasanian examples 78 In the medieval Islamic period elephants had great value and regal status and as such were often richly caparisoned 79 Such noble pachyderms are shown together with disproportionately diminutive quadruped dragons on a saddle cloth,

known as the celebrated Khurasanian “Elephant Silk,” which was preserved as the shroud of Saint Jodokus (Saint Josse) (fig 85a) 80 The silk samite survives as a group of fragments which show two superimposed pairs of large, confronted elephants in the central field The great beasts are lavishly caparisoned with saddle blankets, their heavy feet with articulated toes being singled out for emphasis These potent symbols of power are each paired with a disproportionately tiny quadruped dragon with a very long sinuous neck almost disappearing between its legs The four-legged dragons rest on feet with separated toes and long, needle-pointed talons, their stiffly raised wings terminating in a small curled tip following post-Sasanian conventions, and their raised undulant tails terminating in a pointed tuft of hair (fig 85b) 81 The depiction is framed above and below by a Kufic inscription in mirror image which includes glory and good wishes to the owner, Qāʾid Abu ’l-Manṣūr Bākh-tigīn, the Turkish āmir of Khurasan, whose execution in 349/960–1 by order of his Samanid sovereign ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Nūh presents a terminus ante quem for dating the textile 82 The silk is framed in the style of a carpet by a procession of camels with flying scarves and roosters with beaded neckbands in each of the corners It thus provides a combination of Sasanian style elements with Central Asian aspects such as the dragons and the camels Belenitskii and Bentowitsch note analogies in the motifs to Sogdian art, in particular with the eighth-century wall painting frieze of the Red Hall at the Sogdian palace at Varakhsha, northwest of Bukhara, featuring elephants being attacked by long-necked mythical creatures 83 The
authors suggest that the dynamic representation of dragons and elephants on the Varakhsha wall paintings may be a translation of the same theme onto a textile in a more static manner and without any apparent connection to the combat theme portrayed at the Varakhsha wall paintings 84 The name of the pachyderm certainly appears as title and opening verse of the early Meccan sūra 105 of the Qurʾān alluding to the failed expedition of the yemenite king Abraha against Mecca His troops had been accompanied by an elephant which on arriving at the frontier of Meccan territory, knelt down and refused to advance further towards the city The episode is related to the tradition according to which the birth of the Prophet is said to have taken place at this time, in the “year of the Elephant ”85 These majestic quadrupeds had a special status and were covetously guarded by the sulṭāns Rulers bestowed elephants only as a great favour or when a commander was appointed to a particularly responsible post 86 Among the Būyids, ʿAḍud alDawla had war elephants (fuyūl muqātila) which he used against his cousin Bakhtiar ibn Muʿizz al-Dawla in 366/977 87 It was also the Ghaznawid sulṭān Masʿūd’s favourite mount for hunting 88 On formal occasions involving solemn processions (mawākeb) the sulṭān rode on an elephant, as in September 422/1031, when Masʿūd proceeded to the plain of Shābahār outside Ghazna to preside over a session of the maẓālim court held for the redress of wrongs 89 The representation of lavishly caparisoned elephants must therefore have served as a proclamation of power and authority for the Turkish āmir Qāʾid Abu ’l-Manṣūr Bākhtigīn The unusual depiction of elephants together

with dragons appears thus to combine the royal symbolism accorded to the elephant with that of the dragon The expression Zanda-pīl, “the furious elephant” is, moreover, a common metaphor used in Persian epic poetry for a pahlavān (hero),90 such as the well-known epithet of Rustam being pīltan, “elephant-bodied ”91 In Wīs u Rāmīn Fakhr al-Dīn Gurgānī praises Wīs’ brothers, the trusted champions of Rāmīn, as “two elephants, two lions like no others,” thereby putting both creatures on a par with each other 92 A proverb from an Afghan manuscript which states that “only Zāl can manage the elephant” (Zāl most likely representing the nephew of Ẓaḥḥāk, the historicised hominoid dragon, in the late eleventh-century epic Kūsh-nāma), might furthermore point to the possibility that the elephant was, as Gianroberto Scarcia has shown, a significant component of the ancient legends of the eastern frontier province of Zābulistan 93

Aspects of the dragon’s association with other animals are encapsulated in a figural scheme portrayed on a gilded copper alloy lantern with a pyramidal cover in openwork which has been dated to the second half of the thirteenth century,
and was used in the Mevlevī Dergāhı in the Rūm Saljuq capital of Konya 94 The front face features double doors with a lobed arch that allow for the insertion of a candle into the cuboid body of the lantern This small lamp, which could serve as a miniature architectural model, shows two upright addorsed “Saljuq-style” dragons crowned with pointed ears with gaping mouths and looped bodies that flank a large, six-petalled star-rosette The dragons face towards open-mouthed lions, each with a raised foreleg and tail that arches over the back ending in a dragon head with closed jaws The composition is set just above the double doors, which are flanked by double-headed birds of prey with looped necks, outspread wings and legs whose tail feathers terminate in the form of a large, inverted palmette bud A cursive inscription at the lower edge of the front face reveals the name of the maker, Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī al-Mawlawī The sides, back and cover of the lamp are covered with floral and stellar ornaments The composition of the rosette flanked by dragons and in turn by dragon-tailed lions surmounting doubleheaded eagles can be assumed to epitomise the power of the sulṭān 95 The fact that the scheme is portrayed on a lamp connects it, moreover, with the theme of light and hence also with the symbolism of the luminaries

a The dragon combat in ancient myth
Combat with the water-controlling dragon
Myths of dragon-like creatures and the vanquishing of these dragons were well-known, if not universal, in the traditions both of the IndoEuropeans and of the Near Eastern civilisations with whom the Persian speaking peoples came into contact from at least the first half of the first millennium bc 1 In these contexts the mythical creatures are suited ideally to play the role of adversaries as they represent forces or elements that interfere with the correct order or functioning of the world, and they are defeated by deities, kings or heroes who shape and organise the cosmos Through their victory the latter acquire authority and power over the newly ordered world The iconography of the dragon combat or encounter, part of the Indo-Iranian literary theme of heroic mythological exploits, draws on the immemorially ancient epic theme of this quest, an ever-recurring motif even in cultures that are culturally and geographically far removed from one another The cosmogonic quality of the dragon-slaying myths evidently lay in the fact that in order to construct or defend world order, the god or hero had to destroy the primeval or chaotic dragon During the remote period of Indo-Iranian unity, an age that long played a key role in the later
cultures of the Near East and India, the IndoIranians may well have imagined dragons harbouring and restraining the heavenly waters, so causing drought, and not releasing them until overcome by a god or hero 2 The oldest texts of the Indo-Iranians, the Vedic texts (1500–1000 bc), are composed in Sanskrit and usually refer to the dragon by the most common word áhi-, while in the old Iranian Avestan texts the term used is azhi, which originally meant only “snake, serpent ”3 Intoxicated and strengthened by the ritual potion of Soma, the divine hero Indra fulfils a cosmogonic act by dismembering the primary denizen of the forces of chaos, the cosmic serpent-monster Vṛ tra (“the enveloper”) whom the Rigveda calls “the first-born of dragons” (prathama-jấm áhīnām, 1 32 4) 4 Indra, who carries the IndoIranian epithet “smashing resistance, obstacles” (ṷṛtra-ǰhan),5 is eulogised in the Sanskrit text of the Rigvedic hymn (1 32) with the words:
I tell now the manly deeds of Indra, The foremost which he did armed with the cudgel He slew the serpent, drilled through to the waters, He split the belly of the mountains 6
Importantly, the stone dragon is split into two halves, the upper half forming Dyáv- “the sky” and the lower kṣám- “the earth ”7 The defeated Vṛ tra is referred to in the Rigvedic texts as áhi-, “serpent,”8 and dāsá, “the pent-up waters with the dāsá as husband, the Serpent as guardian”
1 Cf Watkins, 1995, p 299 The most ancient known traditions about vanquishing dragons go back to the Sumerian, Akkadian and Egyptian mythologies of the first three millennia bc The god Enlil defeats a monstrous dragon, the Labbu, in a Sumerian text The god Marduk vanquishes Tiamat and her conscripts in the Akkadian epic of creation, Enūma Elish, of Babylon In the mythology of the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit the god Baal overcomes the monsters yamm and Mot The dragon Apopis is dispatched by the god Seth in Egyptian mythology In the Hittite texts of Bogazköy, the dragon Illuyanka fights the weather god 2 Skjærvø, “Aždahā I,” EIr In Greek mythology, Zeus slays the monster Typhaon/Typhon that has a hundred snake heads (Hesiod, Theogony 825–626) 3 Watkins, 1995, p 299
4 Indra similarly defeats the monster Vala (valá-, meaning “enclosure”) who may have been conceptionally identical with Vṛtra at an earlier stage of the myth being derived from the same root, val-/var- “to cover, to enclose”; Vala thereupon frees the goddess of dawn, Ushas, whom he had imprisoned Janda, 2010, pp 27, 65, 247, 266, 270 5 Watkins, 1995, p 299. 6 Cited after idem, p 304 It is interesting to note the ambiguity surrounding the killing of the primordial dragon conveyed in the Purāṇic accounts in which, paradoxically, Vṛtra is said to be a brāhmaṇa and Indra is decried for committing brahmanicide, the most heinous of all sins Cf Long, 1976, p 172, n 3, and p 192, n 29 7 Janda, 2010, pp 45–70, esp 27, 63, 79, 266, 270 8 Rigveda 1 32 5, 1 32 8, 1 8 10, 1 61 8, 1 103 7

(Rigveda 1 32 11) The word dāsá is translated by Calvert Watkins as “hostile demon,” “enemy,” but also “non-āryan, barbarian,” as well as “slave ”9 Indra released the waters “surrounded by the serpent” (páriṣṭhitā áhinā) and struck down the dāsá (Rigveda 2 11 2) 10 The serpent and the sobriquet in Indo-Iranian may be linked as aǰhi- dāsá-, from which originate the Vedic áhi- ... dāsá- as well as the Iranian name of the dragon Azhi Dahāka 11 Significantly, one of the principal functions of the divinity was not necessarily to kill the huge dragon, but rather to destroy an obstacle, vәrәthra-, which tried to withhold the flow of the generative waters, thus to fulfil a cosmogonic task 12 The water-controlling aspect of the dragon has analogies in the figure of Vṛ tra as well as Azhi Dahāka who becomes the hominoid Azhdahāk 13 As has been suggested, the mythological character of Azhdahāk may well be older than the Zoroastrian texts which first record his name, since figures of anthropomorphised dragons already appear in Bronze Age Central Asia 14 In the Avestan sources the mortal hero-king Thraētaona (Pahl Frēdōn, N Pers Farīdūn, Arm Hruden), whose abode was presumably the Central Asian steppes,15 is associated with the feat of conquering the dragon Azhi Dahāka with his mighty club and thus restoring order and

Mihragān Fallāḥ Rastgār, pp 431–3, as cited in Bosworth, “Court and courtiers,” EIr Stripped of their original Zoroastrian religious significance, these traditional festival patterns had also survived under the ʿAbbasid caliphs, as attested by the verses of various contemporary Arabic poets; for instance, the Nawrūz poem by Ḥusain ibn Ẓaḥḥāk Khalīʿ and the Mihragān poem attributed to the caliph al-Maʾmūn (see Masʿūdī, Kitāb murūj al-dhahab, tr and ed Barbier de Meynard and de Courteille, 1917, vol 8, pp 277–8, 340–2) In the sulṭānate of his predecessor, Masʿūd ibn Maḥmūd of Ghazna, the exchange of customary gifts and tribute for this festival was accompanied by much drinking of wine (rasm) which was associated with the celebration of Mihragān since Achaemenid times (Fallāḥ Rastgār, pp 431–3; Browne, 1920, vol 1, pp 475–6; Clinton, 1972, p 136; for the verses of Manūchihrī, see also Hanaway, 1988, pp 69–80, as well as Bayhaqī’s Taʾrīkh-i Bayhaqī) 32 Berger and Luckmann, 1971, p 121 33 Patmutʿiwn Hayocʿ, tr Langlois, 1872, p 40 and n 1 The dragon-slaying characteristic of Vahagn has also been interpreted as secondary or due to local elements (Benveniste and Renou, 1934, p 80) While Iran conserved the ancient deity, India may have fused the deity with the hero and thus Indra was associated with the characteristics and functions of Vṛtraghan; see Gnoli, “Bahrām,” EIr 34 Patmutʿiwn Hayocʿ, tr Langlois, 1872, p 41 and n 1 35 Cf Russell, 2004, p 357

awesome chaos in order to recreate social reality as Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann have aptly pointed out:32
All societies are constructions in the face of chaos The constant possibility of anomic terror is actualized whenever the legitimations that obscure the precariousness are threatened or collapse And in such situations, or more regularly in ceremonially created periods of crisis – literally: separation between two eras, situations, periods – a ‘deep legitimacy’ is required, referring to a mythical reality outside ours, ‘the other reality’, lying beyond the borders of history and space, an eternal truth that existed before time but still exists behind it and behind our reality, and occasionally mingles with ours in ‘periods of exception’
Zoroastrian myth also influenced Armenian legends The early dragon-slaying myth of the Avestan victory god Vәrәthraghna (O Iran Vṛ traghan, N Pers Bahrām), “the best-armed of the heavenly gods, the strongest in strength, the most victorious in victory, the most glorious in glory,” may have been conserved in the Armenian national hero Vahagn (who carries the epithet vishapakʿagh, “who handles dragons”) 33 According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene, Vahagn fought with and vanquished dragons, his deeds equalling those of Heracles 34 The golden aspect of the god is reflected in the song of the birth of Vahagn, the oldest testimony of Armenian literature,35 which also survived in
Jamshīd appeared before his people radiating like a second sun 24 Thereafter, al-Bīrūnī relates, Jamshīd’s rule was just and prosperous “until the time when Bīwarāsp [Ẓaḥḥāk/Dahāk]25 appeared who killed [him] and subdued his realm ”26 In turn, as al-Bīrūnī reports, the dragon Bīwarāsp/Dahāk is vanquished by the dragonfighter Farīdūn (the Avestan Thraētaona) during the festival of Mihragān, which he then instituted to celebrate his victory over the usurping tyrant, whom he bound in fetters and imprisoned in Mount Damāwand,27 an extinct volcano in northern Iran as well as the highest peak in the country Significantly, according to various traditions, the sun appeared for the first time on the day of Mihragān 28 Al-Bīrūnī further states that the Persian theologians conceived the prestigious ancient festival of Mihragān:
as a sign of resurrection and the end of the world, because at Mihragān that which grows reaches its perfection 29
The festival was also “a time for rallying the forces of good to oppose the demons of coming winter and darkness ”30 It is also interesting to note that the celebration of Mihragān was accorded great importance at the courts of most rulers in the Turko-Iranian environment until the Mongol invasion 31 A typology of such festivals shows the constant need of society to struggle against marginal situations such as a savage exterior or

The eschatological role of the hero
Middle Persian/Pahlawī texts describe an eschatological myth which shows the dragon as the being responsible for the lapse into chaos and death that is to take place at the end of time As a consequence of this metamorphosis the latter has to be fought by valorous characters symbolising the status quo The dragon-fighter Frēdōn (the Avestan Thraētaona) is first mentioned as fulfilling an eschatological role: he defeats but does not kill the giant dragon, binding and imprisoning him “in the most grievous punishment of confinement” at Mount Damāwand 54 The conquering hero thereby also frees the royal women, Sauuaŋhauuāci and Arənauuāci, “the two most beautiful women in the world,” the two wives of Azhi Dahāka/Ẓaḥḥāk 55 Hence in later myths female figures appear to have replaced water and rain as symbols of fertility and life 56 The theme of the rescue of a princess or maiden by the dragon vanquisher, which became a regular topos in most Iranian dragon-slaying stories, was introduced when the dragon became identified with a historical person, such as the foreign tyrant Ẓaḥḥāk, who imprisoned the maiden 57 The dragon remains bound at Mount Damāwand until the end of the world approaches when the other great dragonfighter, Kərəsāspa (who figures as Kirsāsp in Mid Pers and Garshāsp in N Pers ) will be awakened (resurrected) by the divine beings Srōsh and Nēryōsang 58 It is for him that the final victorious battle against the dragon is reserved, the final war between Good and Evil Spirits 59 His eschatological work takes place and Kərəsāspa defeats the dragon when he emerges near the end of time from his captivity, breaks free of his fetters, wreaks havoc and causes much devastation in the world 60
version of this story is also given by the seventhcentury Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang who visited and described the dragon cave which at that time was well-known for the belief that the Buddha had once been there on a supernatural visit and had left his “luminous reflected image ”50 It is noteworthy that whereas Indra kills the dragon, the Buddha chooses to subdue, tame and convert Apalāla and Gopāla, by opening their eyes to the destruction they had caused and by “graphically showing [them] the world as it truly is – an intolerable place of pain ”51 Rather than physical dominance or even the destruction of the dragon, he advocates introspective paths and moral transformation Another Buddhist story recorded by Xuanzang concerns a nāgarāja who lives in a lake on a mountain two hundred miles northwest of Kapisa After many years of stirring up natural forces to destroy the monasteries and stūpas founded by the Kushāṇa king Kanishka, the creature is eventually overcome by the king The story relates how the thunderous voice of the dragon “shook the earth, and the fierce winds tore up the trees, whilst stones and sand pelted down like rain,” whereupon the king summons all the accumulated merit of his past lives and “from both his shoulders there arose a great flame and smoke ”52 This form of imagery shows a solar ruler who tames the monstrous dragon-nāgarāja by making a pact with him: as soon as some unfavourable weather phenomenon appears, the ghantā (cymbal or drum) will sound to remind the dragon of his promise whereupon he will cause the danger to subside 53

b Iconography of the medieval dragon-fighter
The visual representation of a fighter, whether mounted or on foot, doing battle with a dragon employs a traditional and enduring iconographical formula of some antiquity and wide diffusion throughout Central Asia and the Near Eastern world, part of a stock of popular imagery that survived into medieval times The fighter takes aim at the dragon using a variety of weapons, including bow and arrow, sword, spear or long lance, while the dragon is shown either as a lively upright creature imbued with fighting spirit, or in the guise of a vanquished dragon lying on its back beneath the horse’s feet with gaping upturned jaws The representation of the single equestrian dragonfighter may be divided into two basic groups: the rider distinguished by royal or divine attributes, as graphically depicted in the investiture relief of Ardashīr I at Naqsh-i Rustam, discussed below, or the figure of the hunter or warrior, prevalent in the medieval Islamic period, without such insignia In Sasanian royal imagery Ahura Mazdā/ Ohrmazd is shown on horseback crushing the head of the Zoroastrian evil principle of the universe, Angra Mainyu, known in later times as Ahriman who is likened to the serpent in the Great Bundahishn (“Book of Primal Creation”), Pahlawī translations based on lost Avestan scriptures of the third century ad and before and their commentaries written after the Arab conquest 74 It describes him as having sprung:
Zoroastrianism which is a prophetic religion with a revealed scripture offers salvation to the souls of its adherents and humanity can be redeemed The dualistic worldview inherent in its belief system61 dictates that “Evil must be annihilated by Good, if God is to save his creation ”62 Hence in the younger Avestan hymns the myth of the dragon-fighter inherited from Indo-European times acquired an additional semantic component, that of the coming world saviour or Saoshiiaṇt (Pahl Sōshyans) This Saoshiiaṇt is characterised by the epithet “victorious” (Av vәrәthrajan-)63 who, in the last days, “is conceived of as not only utterly defeating Evil but also as ushering in a new age ”64 “He is the one who brings about the Renovation of the world (Av frashō.kәrәti) in which Ahura Mazdā’s good and perfect Creation is restored and freed from all Evil ”65 Significantly, his victory over the monstrous dragon became the “pre-condition for the resurrection of the dead and the beginning of a new era ”66 The Zoroastrian eschatological myth recounts the coming of the final cosmic saviour, who is believed to come from the region of the Helmand river (Haētumaṇt, “with dams” in the Avesta) in Sakastān/Sīstān in southeastern Iran and southwest Afghanistan 67 He is the son of Vīspa tauruuairī, who became pregnant by the Prophet Zarathushtra’s own seed while bathing in Lake Kasaoiia, his seed being miraculously preserved in the depth of the lake guarded by “guardian spirits ”68 She will bear a son called Astuuaṱ әrәta, the last and greatest of the ancient Avestan valiant warriors, who will brandish the victorious weapon borne by other heroes before him, especially Thraētaona when he slew the dragon Dahāka 69 With this weapon (which belongs to the terminology of the Indo-European myth of the hero killing a dragon, Av azhi- “snake, serpent, dragon,” jan- “to kill”) he will drive out Falsehood from the world of Truth (Zamyād yasht 19 93) 70 The corresponding Vedic adjective vṛtrahán- (“slayer

A mounted dragon-fighter distinguished by a flaming halo appears on seal stones from the Iranian world79 such as a sixth-century brownred jasper, preserved in the State Hermitage, St Petersburg (fig 87) The rayed halo that surrounds the rider’s head and shoulders probably symbolises the khurrak-i Kayan (the khvarәnah of the Avestan texts and Firdawsī’s farr-i kayani), the Royal Splendour of the Kayanids (the protagonists of a millenary struggle against Tūrān), the radiance that descends upon the heroic warrior and, above all, the ruler and renders him sacred 80 The rider thus probably represents one of the ancient Indo-Iranian epic heroes that fulfil a mythical quest He is seen holding a spear and battling with what appears to be a seven-headed dragon whose body coils along the edge of the seal from below the horse’s hooves, rising upwards with one dragon head surmounting the other He is flanked by the figure of a small scorpion and a star The depiction visualises here the popular imagery of the hero as a “beneficial force” attacking a monstrous dragon representing a “malevolent force ” In the historical story in the Pahlawī text Kārnāmak-i Ardakhshīr-i Pāpakān (“Book of the Deeds of Ardashīr, Son of Pāpak”), written around 600, the founder of the Sasanian dynasty Ardashīr Pāpakān (224–241) himself is related to the valiant ritual of killing a dragon called Haftān-bōkht (the Haftwād of Firdawsī’s Shāhnāma) who lived in the village of Alār in the rustāq of Kojārān 81 Prominent depictions of the equestrian dragon-fighter are encountered on wall paintings discovered by Russian archaeologists in the city of Panjikent in Sogdiana (Zarafashān, north of the Hiṣār range), now at the State Hermitage, St Petersburg The depictions show pictorial epics from a variety of literatures, among them the Greek fables of Aesop and the Indian epic
...like a snake, out of the sky down to the earth, ... thereby the sky was as shattered and frightened by him, as a sheep by a wolf 75
The association of the serpent with Ahriman is perhaps best portrayed in the monumental third-century investiture relief sculptures of the Sasanian king Ardashīr I (r 224–241) at Naqsh-i Rustam It shows a bilateral equestrian scene The conquering king Ardashīr appears on the left, facing an anthropomorphic Ahura Mazdā with turreted crown on the right, shown in the act of bestowing on Ardashīr the gift of khvarәnah, in the form of a ring to be hung over and secured around the royal crown Ardashīr’s steed is shown trampling on the head of the last Parthian leader Ardavān (Artabanus) V, while Ahura Mazdā’s horse treads underfoot a creature held in the coils of serpents The plastically sculpted reliefs draw on the age-old universally understood motif of the ruler placing his foot on a prostrate enemy as a symbolic gesture of physical as well as ideological supremacy, the horse serving in this instance as a visual extension of the ruler, his rider 76 This visual realisation of victory is of particular significance: the vanquished enemy, his head wreathed with serpents, one of which uprears its head at the front, presumably represents the anthropomorphic Ahriman, and thus the first dated example of a symbolic synthesis of the serpent and Ahriman (figs 86a and b) 77 The defeat of the Parthian leader is thus equated with triumphing over the powers of evil Inscriptions in three languages, Middle Persian, Parthian and Greek, on the horses’ flanks identify the god and the conqueror 78 The representation of the paired mounted horsemen, imperial and divine, surmounting prostrate enemies, human and satanic, thus underscores the triumph by metaphorically alluding to a complex of eschatological beliefs

Correspondingly, Rustam is shown confronting the dragon as if it were a human adversary 95 Igor P’yankov notes the archaic style of Firdawsī’s records of the Rustam cycle and has demonstrated its close parallels with ancient Greek records, particularly Herodotus’ accounts of one of the genealogical myths of the Scythians (Histories IV 8–9) 96 According to the father of Greek historiography the hero, known by the Greeks as Herakles, comes to an arid region at the Pontus Shore (Black Sea) later inhabited by the Scythians where he loses his horses and in the search for them meets in a cave in the forest a mythical creature described as a woman with the lower body of a serpent 97 With this anguipede woman he engenders three sons, the youngest and worthiest of whom, named Scythes, becomes the first king of the Scythians In Firdawsī’s account Rustam’s first feat is his victory over a lion whose pelt he wears just like the Grecian Herakles after the latter’s vanquishing of the Nemean lion 98 The second exploit is the discovery of a spring in the desert country 99 The third is the victory over the dragon While there is no love theme in the third trial, the fourth episode recorded in the Shāh-nāma mentions a sorceress in the form of a beautiful girl who tries to seduce Rustam near a small river in the shade of some trees 100 Parts of the story are shown on a continuous frieze of the Sogdian wall paintings in Panjik
Mahābhārata, as well as episodes from the heroic cycle, the dragon-fighter being identified by Aleksandr Belenitskii as the hero-champion Rustam 82 The hero’s ancestors were Saka people who are part of the Scytho-Siberian cultural grouping and belong to the Indo-Iranian group that came to Sakastān/Sīstān and Zābulistān in the late second century bc,83 lands far from Sogdia Saka heroic tales were nevertheless very popular with the Sogdians,84 although only a fragmentary Sogdian text survives85 and only in the tenth century was the tale taken up by Firdawsī in his magnum opus The heroic cycle of Rustam’s Herculean seven feats (haft khwān) attains almost spiritual importance 86 Before reaching his ultimate goal the hero has to undergo these trials,87 which represent a kind of rite of passage 88 During his third feat, which is reminiscent of Herakles defeating the Hydra of Lerna,89 Rustam slays a magical dragon that is guarding a watering place which the ram has shown90 and comes out of the forest at night and approaches the sleeping hero 91 Twice he is woken by his formidable mount Rakhsh,92 but each time the dragon vanishes On the third occasion the monster fails to conceal itself in time and with the help of the faithful Rakhsh the hero succeeds in killing the dragon Interestingly, the Shāh-nāma portrays the dragon with human traits such as the power of reflection93 and speech: during the battle he declares himself master of the whole desert 94

Bare-handed in the cradle with his mighty arms he tore apart the dragon’s jaws 109
ent The monster is depicted as a terrifying shedragon who has coiled her elongated serpentine tail around all four legs of the horse (probably to be understood as Rakhsh),101 her female upper body rises up, naked to the waist With her long arms she is dragging the mounted Rustam-like hero’s head towards her The hero has succeeded in wounding the dragon twice with his axe (fig 88) 102 In the next scene the dragon, its wounds gushing blood, is in its death-throes In contrast to the preceding images, it now lies prostrate on the ground (fig 89) 103 Boris Marshak explains the depiction of the serpentine she-dragon with human arms and lion’s mane as a conflation of three trials mentioned in the Shāh-nāma, namely the fight with the dragon, the lion and the sorceress 104 While the genealogical aspect of the myth was apparently forgotten, some analogies with the original theme of the mythical anguipede progenitrix appear to have been retained 105 An equestrian dragon-fighter is also portrayed on a tympanum from the medieval city of Bunjikat (20 kilometres south of the modern town of Shahristan in northern Tajikistan) in the Sogdian principality of Ustrushana, probably dating from the seventh to the ninth century A row of pearl roundels frame the rim of the monumental wooden arch-shaped tympanum (partly destroyed by fire) that adorned the top of the portal leading to the throne hall of the Qalʿa-i Qahqaha, now

It is interesting to compare this imagery with that of the infant Rustam whose arms are associated with courageous dragons in the Shāh-nāma account 110 The theme of the dragon-slayer appears in a mid-twelfth-century book on cosmography written in Persian and dedicated to the last Great Saljuq sulṭān of Iran and Iraq, Ṭoghrıl III ibn Arslan (r 571/1176–590/1194) The story in Muḥammad ibn Maḥmūd ibn Aḥmad-i Ṭūsī’s “Book of Marvels,” entitled ʿAjāʾib al-makhlūqāt (“Wonders of Creation”),111 illustrates the power of talismanic images hidden in the pre-conquest Byzantine capital Constantinople (al-Qusṭantīniyya) 112 Three bronze statues representing Muḥammad and two of his closest followers, ʿAlī and Bilāl (the first muezzin), were zealously guarded by the local people; they knew from past experience that damage to the statues would set off a devastating earthquake 113 Significantly, of the three statues only the one which shows ʿAlī on horseback striking a dragon with a spear is illustrated in the manuscript 114 While on the one hand this story is buttressed by apocalyptic traditions, such as the prophetic ḥadīth foretelling the city’s capture by an Islamic ruler who bore the name of a prophet,115 it is also noteworthy that it was the Byzantine capital which was associated with the figure of the equestrian dragon-slayer However, the story also shows that the dragon-fighter represented a well-established iconographical theme in medieval Islam It was indeed so firmly entrenched as to be deemed the most appropriate imagery for the representation of the Companion of the Prophet who for the Sunnī Muslims represents the fourth caliph and for the Shīʿites the divinely appointed successor (khalīfa) and heir (waṣī) of Muḥammad By the twelfth century, dragon-fighter iconography was a prevalent part of a set narrative genre often inspired by textual sources such as the early eleventh-century Iranian national epic, the Shāh-nāma, and was a motif of choice depicted on many portable objects produced in medieval Western Central Asia The theme

He was a young man famous for his strength, had curly hair and swung his club; he smote the horny dragon, the horse-swallowing and man-swallowing, full of poison, yellow of colour, over whom yellow poison flowed as high as a spear On his back Kərəsāspa cooked his meal in an iron cauldron at the time of noon And the monster felt warm and began to sweat Then he rushed from under the iron cauldron and upset the boiling water Affrighted rushed headlong the valiant Kərəsāspa

lonians; the Jewish Prophet Daniel killed it without sword or staff by brewing a concoction of pitch, fat, and hair and then feeding cakes made of it to the dragon (Gunkel, 1895, pp 320–3, cogently argues that this story is an adaptation of a passage of the Babylonian creation epic Enūma Elish, an Akkadian text; cf idem, 1895, pp 412–3, tablet IV, ll 93–104; Pritchard, ed , 1955, repr 1968, p 67) The execution of enemies seems sometimes to have been inspired by the manner in which the dragon was killed in these traditions (Merkelbach, “Drache,” RAC IV, 1959, pp 234–5) Mithridates VI (120–163 bc), king of Pontus, for instance, gave orders to execute Manius Aquilius by pouring liquid gold down his throat (Appianos, Mithridates, XII 21; Pliny, Naturalis Historia, XXXIII 48; cf idem, pp 234–5) This method of killing the dragon is described by al-Qazwīnī in his Kitāb ʿajāʾib al-makhlūqāt (ed Wüstenfeld, 1849, repr 1967, p 112) For the illustration of this story in the so-called Sarre Qazwīnī, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, see Badiee, 1978, pl 32 The theme is also visualised in a fourteenth-century
of a mounted figure fighting a dragon was applied widely to objects and architectural decoration in Anatolia and the neighbouring Jazīra The motif occurs on an important frieze fragment from the now destroyed pavilion (once part of the palace) of Qılıch Arslan II (r 551/1156588/1192), one of the greatest Rūm Saljuq sulṭāns, noted both for his military achievements and his patronage of the arts It shows two haloed horsemen charging each other and attacking respectively a dragon and a lion (fig 98) The rider on the left thrusts his long spear into the gaping jaws of the dragon The beast is shown with curling goatee beard projecting below the chin, and a pronounced bristling crest running down the spine to the tapering tail The second horseman turns around to grasp the lion’s mane with one hand while dealing him a blow with the sword held in the other The Rūm Saljuq depiction thus provides a parallel to the version emblematised on the Iranian penbox made by Maḥmūd ibn Sunqur (fig 93) almost a century after the making of the frieze This composition, moreover, again features the fight of confronted horsemen against the most dangerous and deadliest of adversaries, the dragon and the lion The fragment must have been part of a large frieze and is a valuable example of the type of decoration that presumably once adorned not only Saljuq-period pavilions but related secular buildings throughout the entire region as far as Central Asia 128 One of the earliest depictions of the motif of the single equestrian dragon-fighter west of Iran is found on the coinage of Turko-Islamic Anatolia An equestrian warrior spearing a prostrate scaly dragon appears on the reverse of a copper coin of a type minted by the last Türkmen Dānishmendid
sea When the dragon swallowed these, his stomach burst Significantly, in stories where the dragon was presented as a historical person, the invulnerability of the hide was metaphorically transformed into the impregnability of the enemy’s castle 125 The depiction of a fighter on foot in direct combat with a dragon whom he attacks with his sword – a motif which appears to be absent from Christian iconography – is found on the outer walls of a celebrated plate whose interior is decorated with a large battle scene featuring the siege of a citadel and inscribed with the names of the warriors These names incorporate Turkish elements, suggesting that they may have been Saljuq fighters 126 Datable to the early thirteenth century, the plate is housed in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (fig 97) 127 The outer walls show a richly clad warrior carrying bow and arrow, shown in three-quarter view and facing a writhing ophidian dragon in rampant posture The dragon combat is one of five heroic feats portrayed on the plate, the vignettes being separated by trees Other feats include the shooting of a wolf with bow and arrow, clubbing a feline, probably a panther, with a mace, and shooting a mythical creature with bow and arrow A further element shows two confronted figures, one of whom is holding a feline, probably a cheetah, on a leash An upper register contains an epigraphic band with good wishes in Kufic script Following the Saljuq victory at the battle of Manzikert in 463/1071 and subsequent largescale Turkish penetration into Anatolia, the Saljuq sulṭāns of Rūm, being closely affiliated with Iranian cultural and artistic traditions, also perpetuated these semantic horizons.

struck by the crusader prince Roger (d 513/1119), who usurped the throne of Antioch in the guise of regent for Bohemond II between 1112 and 1119,133 and can ultimately be traced back to early Byzantine coinage 134 On Roger’s coin the equestrian rider is similarly portrayed nearly in profile and leaning forward on a galloping horse to stab the mouth of a serpent with his lance The inscription identifies the figure as Saint George In spite of the differences in the iconographic representation of this mounted dragon-fighting warrior, in particular the depiction of the figure in profile, there is an overall consistency with the image of contemporaneous dragon-fighters throughout medieval Western Asia The cosmopolitan milieu and the generous patronage of Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ (618/1222–657/ 1259) in Mosul permitted the city to become a haven for master craftsmen from Central Asia who were fleeing the Mongol invasion 135 Among them were specialist inlay workers from the greater Khurasan region (where the technique was developed) 136 Their skill is prominently displayed on a copper alloy candlestick base, probably made in the Jazīra in c 1230, and inscribed with the names of the masters, Ḥājji Ismāʿīl and Muḥammad ibn Futtūḥ al-Mawṣilī 137 The dragon-fighting theme is shown in a large polylobed cartouche depicting a rampant knotted creature that rises above the horse’s rump, his large open maw with projecting tongue oriented towards the rider who turns towards it with raised sword in hand (fig 99) 138 The same iconography of a horseman fighting a dragon reappears in a mid-thirteenth-century glazed fritware sculpture, now preserved in the National Museum of Damascus Possibly a fountain element, it was discovered in Raqqa, a major city in the western part of the Jazīra 139 The warrior wears his hair in long braids under a small cap

Luʾluʾ became official ruler (atābeg) of Mosul, and the Mongol invasion in 656–7/1257–8, when his rule was terminated although he succeeded in keeping Mosul as vassal of Hūlāgū 141 The inscription also gives the atābeg’s honorary titles and relates him in a eulogy to the Saka hero Rustam, “the Rustam-i Zāl of our time,” thus showing him in a long line of kings and underlining his legitimacy as ruler 142 It was fitting for Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ who governed Mosul for the longest time, and who was a freedman probably of Armenian servile origin, to carry Arab names, Persian titles and to be depicted as Turkic leader 143 The accompanying inscription also grants sanctuary to all comers144 which underlines the protective function of the motif The depiction of the hand-to-hand combat of the dragon-fighter on foot on the gateway at al-Khān has a counterpart in the representation on the Mosul gate which secures the entrance to the small mountain town of ʿAmādiya, or al-ʿImādiyya, northeast of Mosul 145 Its monumental display echoes that on al-Khān, in particular the portrayal of the fighters who attack the dragon with a sword (although not with a lance as at al-Khān) One way in which the representations differ is that at ʿAmādiya the horned dragons are shown addorsed: the protomes project in rampant posture at the apex of the arched entrance from the top of a large knot, reminiscent of the “Syrian knot,” that ties their ophidian bodies The gaping mouths reveal the bifid tongues that entwine at mid-section (the same feature can be observed on figs 78 and 160), and again the fighters grip with one hand the tips of the dragons’ noses while with the other hand aiming their swords at the dragons’ necks Significantly, the quadripartite knot encloses a composite hemispherical rosette formed of fine pointed petals arranged radially
and with his sword and round decorated shield defends himself against the dragon as it rears up to strike Images of paired dragons are prominently depicted in the Mosul area, the heart of the Jazīra, on the gateway to the only remaining caravanserai located between Mosul and Sinjār, known as Khariyyāt al-Khān or Khān al-Harārāt, which is now partly destroyed 140 The reliefs on each half of the archivolts of the monumental archway show two horned dragons with backward-facing heads, fighting off warriors on foot distinguished by haloes and shown in three-quarter view The dragons are closely related to those on the Bāb al-Ṭilasm in Baghdad Curved horns project from the crown of the head The strong forelegs end in feet with individual pointed talons and the slender arched wings have finely delineated plumes The heads are also rendered in three-quarter view with wide-open jaws revealing sharp teeth; high vertically hatched ruff-like projections demarcate the necks The scaly serpentine tails form a pretzel-shaped knot and a single loop before gradually tapering to terminate in another small dragon head projecting from the inward-curling tail tip The fabulous creatures are being attacked by the lances of the long-haired bearded figures who grip the tips of the dragons’ noses with one hand while holding the lance in the other Importantly, as will be further discussed below, the dragon-fighting reliefs surmount an imposing arch charged with nine equidistantly placed cusped medallions enclosing eight-petalled starrosettes (figs 100a and b) The epigraphic frieze on the portal of the khān identifies the Zangīd successor Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ Abu ’l-Faḍāʾil al-Malik al-Raḥīm (618/1222657/1259) as patron, through which the khān can be dated between 631/1233–4, when Badr al-Dīn

popular cult of Khiḍr at the regional monastery of Mār Behnām/Deir al-Khiḍr, located southeast of Mosul, an important place of pilgrimage for Jews, Christians and Muslims The iconography of the dragon-slayer, regarded as Saint George as well as al-Khiḍr, played a pertinent role at the monastery In the age of syncretism this however does not exclude the possibility that Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ wished to benefit from these different layers of identification of the dragon-fighter motif and to build his historical charisma upon a rhetorical association of his personality with religious figures – his conscious association with al-Khiḍr – as well as “mythical” figures associated with Iranian legendary history and national epic – he is called “the Rustam-i Zāl of our time ” Being an astute diplomat he thereby clearly relied on the potency and cultural resonance that these figures possessed at the time, arguably to enhance his position as powerful ruler and defender of his realm as well as to appropriate symbolically the religio-cultural space of his realm It also demonstrates his ambition to create a cultural paradigm by embracing a multilayered symbolism which includes syncretic religious aspects as well as ancient Iranian traditions This was visually anchored in the figure of the dragon-fighter as well as the symbol of the interlaced dragons at ʿAmādiya It may be hypothesised that akin to the motif of the interlaced dragons, added around a century earlier to the otherwise late Byzantine style coinage of the Artuqid ruler Fakhr al-Dīn Qara Arslan (figs 32a and b), these symbols were chosen in the spirit of a conscious revival of imagery carrying an association with the glorious Iranian past The royal messages conveyed by the sculptures on the gateways of al-Khān and ʿAmādiya demonstrate visual expressions of both power and ideologies that are remarkably fluid, traversing geographical, religious and cultural boundaries yet another manifestation of the mounted dragon-fighter is found in a mid- to late thirteenth-century Anatolian manuscript, known as Daqāʾiq al-Ḥaqāʾiq, dedicated to the Saljuq sulṭān Ghiyāth al-Dīn Kay Khusraw III, which is variously dated Ramaḍān 670/April 1272 and
in superimposed layers The rayed outline of the rosette adds to the overall starburst effect, underlining the identification of the rosette as a solar symbol The base extends to form an interlaced festoon that frames the arched aperture which includes a small eight-petalled rosette at the apex (fig 101) 146 The solar iconography of the large central rosette adds weight to the identification of the small rosette, just like the closely related rosettes emblazoned on the gateway to al-Khān, as stellar symbol As also shown in the above-discussed reliefs on the Bāb al-Ḥayyāt in Aleppo (fig 3a), on Karatay Han (figs 4a and b) and on the small “Kiosk Mosque” situated in Sultan Han (fig 12), the latter two examples being located near Kayseri, this once again associates dragons with stellar constellations As noted, in contrast to the depiction on al-Khān, on which the mirror image of the dragon fight is rendered in a confronted manner, the dragons are shown as addorsed Their bodies issue from the knotted configuration that encloses the solar symbol and then extends to frame the arch The creatures may thus be seen to hold or bind the sun by means of the knotted enclosure yet at the same time, they appear to emerge from the solar symbol The relief is thus an important example of the dual symbolism inherent in the dragon’s connection with the sun which has often been associated with the occurrence of the eclipse as will be seen below Only fragments remain of the architectural inscription147 which again names Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ as benefactor and thus dates the relief, like the façade sculptures at al-Khān, to the period of his rule At that time the treasury was kept at ʿAmādiya,148 which might have provided all the more reason for Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ to emblematise himself as a dragon-fighter set within the complex of stellar allusions on the town gate At the same time it is interesting to consider the identification of the standing haloed fighters with the syncretistic figure of the Islamic Prophet Khiḍr,149 guide of wayfarers and patron saint of travellers and, moreover, identified with the Christian dragon-slayer Saint George 150 This is especially pertinent in view of the widespread

c The Eastern Christian holy rider as dragon-fighter
The idea of connecting the cult and iconography of the Eastern Christian warrior saints with the dragon can be traced to at least the early seventh century 157 The dragon motif in the Christian church developed in the eastern confines of Byzantium,158 where the so-called holy rider vanquishing a dragon was a well-established literary topos and was represented in early wall paintings 159 Depictions are found on portable items, ranging from magical amulets to luxury objects, as well as on sacred architecture, in particular churches and funerary settings The motif fell on particularly fertile ground in the Transcaucasus region which was part of the pan-Iranian religio-cultural realm and was steeped in its artistic conventions The antecedents of the victorious equestrian figure fighting a dragon have been sought further west where they have been linked to votive reliefs with Thracian horsemen, confronted or single, and a serpent sinuously rising towards the rider’s
mid-Shawwāl 671/early May 1273,151 although the illustrations may be of a later date 152 It shows the warrior as a mounted angel with long beard, wearing a three-pointed Iranian crown and shawl that streams in the wind The figure is identified as Shamhūrash (an angel known as judge and ruler of the jinn), who is about to pierce a dragon with a sword 153 The weapon of choice, a sword, recalls the stucco relief from the Saljuq palace in Konya The dragon’s head was partly cut off when the margin was trimmed, leaving only the open snout with curled tip; the long tail forms a large pretzel-like knot and a simple loop (fig 102) The manuscript comprises a compilation of five different Persian texts on various topics related to astrology and magic, influenced to a certain extent by Byzantine prototypes The painting is part of a treatise on geomancy and talismans which is further illustrated by the depiction of magic writing on the page, composed of rows of numbers and letters It may be postulated that the representations of the single fighter, mounted or on foot, and of the paired horsemen of the medieval Islamic period did not solely fulfil a decorative purpose Illustrating the belief of the magical power of images, they very likely served as prophylactic and apotropaic representations with a talismanic function, precisely because as André Grabar has observed, “in this domain the possibility of a ‘consubstantiality’ of the representation and the thing represented is implicitly acknowledged ”154 It is also worth noting that in the pictorial representations the dragon and the hero are generally shown in ongoing combat; the monster is sometimes depicted in a rampant posture engaging the hero in furious battle as if to test his valour, hence it is clearly not yet defeated By contrast in Islamic literature of the medieval period, as also seen in the examples cited above, the dragon is generally overcome by the hero A notable excep

shown convincingly that the prostrate figure on these amulets represents a female demon who harms children and pregnant women as attested by late antique magical sources and that the amulets served as prophylactic charms against a variety of illnesses 178 However, the systematic study of this iconography is complicated by difficulties in dating the amulets and by the frequent absence of legends which would make it possible to identify the equestrian figure The rare accompanying legends invoke Solomon the horseman, the formidable enemy of demons, and/or Saint Sisinnios179 (who is thought to have been a Parthian),180 permitting identification with either or both of these figures Through the use of his “magical” seal and other ritual techniques attributed to him, the Jewish king Solomon was considered to be the archetypal controller of spirits and demons,181 the quintessential warrior-magician, a figure that reflected a conflation of parallel Jewish, Christian, Greek

individuals as stated by orthodox Zoroastrianism),189 as is evidenced by the Qumran texts, early Christianity and all Gnostic religions (Hermeticism, Gnosticism, Manichaeism) 190 Christianity, in turn, inherited most of its eschatological perspective from the Iranian-inspired apocrypha of the Old Testament and the Jewish writings of the period just before its emergence 191 The eschatological concept in the struggle against a dragon in Judaeo-Christian tradition has close analogies in ancient Iranian texts, cited above In the Old Testament the resurrection is connected with the myth of Leviathan (Hebrew liwyātān; Ugaritic ltn) who is slain by yahweh and thus plays a role in the eschatological struggle 192 In the Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch (29 4; perhaps early second century ad) Leviathan together with another mythical monster, Behemoth, rises out of the sea at the coming of the Messiah 193 In the Apocalypse of John (20 1–3) the “old dragon” is identified with Satan, evil incarnate An angel descends from heaven with a key to the abyss, the underworld, and a chain to fetter the dragon there for one thousand years 194 Once this term has expired, the dragon is freed to take part in the great final struggle in which it will be decisively defeated, resulting in the resurrection of the dead and the coming of a new age in which death and evil are no more 195 Almut Hintze concludes:
and Iranian traditions when moreover interest in extraneous doctrines and cults was very active 182 These visual images of triumph over the enemy or over the powers of evil were naturally adopted for the presentation of warrior saints,183 the actual systematisation of their cult probably having taken place in Constantinople 184 The image of the dragon being trampled by a potent rider’s horse, traceable to at least the early seventh century, thus mirrors the symbolic meaning of spiritual triumph over the persecutions of tyrannical pagan rulers, representing the crushing of evil and Satan through conversion and the destruction of pagan temples 185 The close parallels in iconography between the Iranian and the Judaeo-Christian traditions expressing the fundamental juxtaposition between victor and vanquished, however, may in large part be due to the influence of Iranian dualist notions on the religions of the Near East from the Achaemenid period to the early centuries of the present era 186 The strong dualistic character of Jewish eschatology, including the belief in the coming of a saviour (messiah),187 a final struggle between Good and Evil, and the resurrection of the dead, seems also to suggest the strong possibility of a borrowing from Zoroastrian doctrine,188 where according to yasna 30 3–5 the good and bad spirits were “twins” (separate, independent

It is very likely that the Jewish/Christian tradition took over the image [of the struggle against a dragon] from the Zoroastrian one in order to formulate its own eschatological myth 196
The metaphysical struggle between fighter and dragon of course represents in a basic sense an “antagonism of the light, celestial (sun), and the dark, terrestrial, principles ”197 By extension traditional combat depictions convey the triumph of good over evil and light over darkness As Kiti Mačabeli observes, the older eastern model of the iconography of the light-bearing horseman lent itself naturally to Transcaucasian Christian imagery, resulting in an identification between the mounted saint as the embodiment of light and the positive principle, seen in the act of crushing the dragon, the quintessential symbol of evil and darkness 198 One illustration of this concept in a Sasanian context is the third-century depiction of the god Ahura Mazdā/Ohrmazd on horseback crushing the head of the Zoroastrian spirit of evil, Angra Mainyu/Ahriman (figs 86a and b) The earliest surviving representations of the dragon-slaying model in Eastern Christian art are found, as mentioned above, on the eastern confines of the Byzantine empire in Transcaucasia This region, and in particular Armenia, was profoundly influenced by Parthian Iranianism, hence it is safe to assume that the artistic traditions had to a certain extent developed in symbiosis with the Iranised world 199 The model underwent a com

pictorial symmetry but rather aimed at reinforcing its potent benefit Hence the visual symmetry of the dragon-fighters was also intended to bring into play the belief in a double protection through the agency of its essential meaning, the triumph of good over evil 208 yet while the influence of the Iranian symbolic repertoire is certainly felt in the symmetrical composition of horsemen and the tree-with-serpents, it is represented here in a Christian context The motif therefore may allude, just like the much later above-discussed miniature from the Yachakhapatum, or a book of homilies, of 1216 illustrated at Skevra monastery in Cilician Armenia (fig 44), to the subject of the serpent and the fruit-bearing tree in Paradise Hence, the representation may be seen as a compound motif linking the dragon-fighting horsemen and the tree-with-serpents Comparable symmetrical imagery of two confronted equestrian warriors also flanking a large stylised tree with curling foliage is found on a now lost stone relief plaque (extant only as a drawing) from a church in Ani Mounted on caparisoned horses with large saddle blankets, the horsemen again mirror each other’s actions yet instead of directing their weapons at serpents entwined around a tree as in the early, possibly seventhcentury, Cappadocian wall paintings at Mistikan kilise, the warriors plunge their long lances down the upturned throats of the dragons whose prostrate bodies are arranged in three loops under the horses’ hooves (fig 105) 209 The depiction in the Ani relief thus follows more common visual conventions current both in Christian and Muslim contexts In another Cappadocian wall painting, found above the vestibule door of the late ninth- or tenthcentury funerary chapel known as yılanlı kilise (“serpent church”) in the Ihlara valley, paired warrior saints thrust their lances into the gaping
portrayal, of the equestrian warrior saints, a significant characteristic, as will be seen in what follows, introduced to augment and reinforce the intended effect, making the paired dragon-fighters a doubly potent emblem Here a unique feature is added to the symmetrical composition of the two horsemen in that they direct their spears at two horned dragons which are entwined around the “trunk” of a central tree-like composition (fig 104) 203 Portrayed with frontally rendered curved horns, globulous eyes and long open muzzles whose slightly bulging tops are demarcated by small wrinkles and which exhibit the lupine characteristic of the steppe dragons, the dragons’ heads come to face the horses’ heads The equines do not prance or rear up on their hind legs, but pose heraldically with one foreleg raised Nicole Thierry sought to explain the composite aspect of the iconography by the fact that Cappadocia served as a large military encampment from where Byzantine troops, among whom were large mercenary contingents, in part of different nomadic origins,204 went to wage war against the Persians and later against the Arabs The influence of the mercenary troops was also felt in the progressive adaptation of military techniques and equipment of a “Turanian cultural community,” which sometimes occurred directly or through Parthian or Sasanian mediation 205 The depiction is in the tradition of widely employed symmetrical Sasanian imagery exemplified in the third-century investiture relief of Ardashīr I at Naqsh-i Rustam with the equestrian scene of Ardashīr facing Ahura Mazdā whose horses’ hooves are shown to trample, respectively, the head of a dead enemy and the serpent-wreathed head of Ahriman (fig 86b) 206 This conceptual pairing aspect is also found on different media, notably on Sasanian and Sogdian textiles 207 Here, too, the pairing of the iconography was presumably not purely intended to create the effect of

role of dragon-slayer 215 Prior to the eleventh century Saint George is almost invariably depicted in combat with a man Then during the eleventh century the visual expression alters and the saint is increasingly represented slaying a dragon 216 The earliest dated and visually identifiable representation of Saint George, killing a man and not yet a dragon, seems to be a relief depiction on the façade of the Armenian church dedicated to the Holy Cross which stands on the small island of Aghtʿamar situated southeast of Lake Van (now in eastern Turkey), erected by king Gagik Artsruni, ruler of the southern Armenian kingdom of Vaspurakan between the years 915 to 921 217 In addition to Saint George, two further mounted warrior saints, Theodore and Sergios, are portrayed The rendition of three equestrian saints, an example of the serialisation of the images, again illustrates the intent to amplify their role visually and thereby intensify their beneficial effect as apotropaic devices The Armenian martyr Saint Sergios, traditionally considered the defender par excellence against all kinds of evil and dangers, was here added to the commonly paired military saints Theodore and George He is depicted killing a feline, probably a panther, while Saint George tramples a supine fettered human figure that in eleventh-century legends is sometimes identified as his persecutor, the emperor Diocletian (fig 108) 218 Saint Theodore is shown thrusting a lance into the upraised open mouth of a dragon, portrayed without wings or legs, its
mouths of a powerful bicephalous dragon, elaborately speckled, who rears up diagonally across the space between the two horses; the larger of the two dragon heads is horned (fig 106) 210 Just above the two dragon heads is a cross with an inscription running on either side that establishes a semantic relation between the idea of Christ’s triumph over evil on the cross and the victory of the saints over the dragon 211 The pictorial and textual elements in the composition of this painting above an entrance have been interpreted as apotropaic in intention A related composition is found on a relief frieze on the western entrance to the Georgian church of the Virgin in Martʿvili, founded by king George II of Aphkhasia (912–957) Here two confronted unidentified holy riders with fluttering cloaks are shown to spear the raised gaping heads of a massive twice looped bicephalous scaled dragon (fig 107) 212 As in the wall painting at yılanlı kilise, one of the dragon heads is larger, has a more pronouncedly curved upper snout and is crowned by what appear to be long pointed ears A pair of winged figures, probably angels, hover on either side of the riders, extending to them crowns from the arc of heaven that were won by the martyrs for their courage in the struggle with demons and invisible enemies 213 Among the military saints Theodore and George were predominantly associated with the miracle of dragon-slaying and often appear together 214 In the hagiographical tradition, Saint Theodore clearly preceded Saint George in the

It describes how Saint George stopped at a lake where he saw a weeping girl about to be sacrificed to the dragon and there performed the miracle of vanquishing the dragon; thereafter the saint accompanies the princess who leads the dragon on a leash towards the city of Lasnia while her father, king Selenios, and the citizens look on The miraculously subdued beast is tamed and symbolically tied to a leash and led about, a crucial detail that establishes the ceremonial and ritual of the subjection of the dragon The earliest dated manuscript in which this story is illustrated is also found in Georgia at Pavnisi (c 1170–1180) 226 However there are other Georgian examples that can be dated earlier on stylistic grounds: Adish (late eleventh century),227 Bočʿorma (c 1100),228 and possibly Ikʾvi (twelfth century) 229 Thereafter the dragon miracle was incorporated as a regular feature in the iconographical repertoire of Saint George yet in Greek the miracle of the dragon is first attested in a late twelfth-century manuscript as an appendix to an account of the Passion of Saint George, and in a roughly contemporary illustration from Anargyroi in Kastoria (c 1180) 230 It is therefore very possible that the story of Saint George and the dragon miracle originated in the Transcaucasian region, probably in Georgia, from where it spread 231 The depiction of the saintly dragon-slayer on a funerary stele from Maraş in southeast Anatolia, now in the Archaeological Museum of Adana,232 attests to the continued importance of the motif A beardless rider distinguished by a circular nimbus and with fluttering scarf is shown to hold a lance in both hands and thrust it into the large gaping jaws of a dragon, depicted with backward thrown head and short forelegs, that succumbs at his feet The dragon’s body is rendered according to the
body patterned with spots and tied into a heartshaped knot (fig 109) 219 The warrior saints hold long cross-ended lances and are portrayed in full military attire according to iconographic types derived mainly from elements borrowed from antiquity, such as the chlamys tied on the right shoulder, the cuirass, short tunic and buskins 220 An early eleventh-century depiction of paired confronted horsemen, identified here as the two saints George and Theodore, spearing respectively an anthropomorphic figure and a twicelooped dragon and surmounted by a stern image of Christ, appears twice on the church of Nikʿorcʿminda built during the last years of Bagrat III’s reign (1010–1014) in the mountainous region of western Georgia, in the province of Racha (fig 110) 221 The scene is once shown on the large tympanum over the western portal and again on the eastern façade The belief in the saints’ power to vanquish evil probably inspired the representation of the motif on the interior and the exterior of churches and funerary structures Its recurrent depiction in the Transcaucasian region, notably on Georgian churches, attests to the great importance accorded to the motif Dragon-slaying riders were progressively identified as warrior saints and can conclusively be interpreted as exercising an apotropaic or protective function 222 The legend of Eastern Christendom’s best known and most venerated dragon-slayer, who also enjoyed considerable popularity in the Latin West, partly as a result of the Crusades,223 is first attested in the eleventh century when miracles were introduced into the Saint George cycle which includes the feat of rescuing a princess from a dragon 224 One such typical story is recorded in an eleventh-century Georgian manuscript preserved in the Patriarchal Library, Jerusalem 225

scabbard, which sets the dragon-slaying iconography alongside the dragon’s inherently prophylactic aspect It moreover represents an example of a pastiche expressing in visual form the coexistence of themes from different religio-cultural repertoires The scabbard is inscribed around the rim with customary good wishes in Arabic rendered in cursive script Whereas the epigraphic frieze is worked in relief, an unusual, shallowly incised depiction is shown below It differs not only in subject matter but also in style and execution from motifs shown on metal objects fabricated in the medieval Islamic world:236 a warrior saint in crusader attire is shown to aim at a prostrate dragon, its slender serpentine body forming a pretzel-like knot at mid-section, and the “Hand of God” projecting from the right to point at the warrior (fig 111) The dragon-slayer motif surmounts a register containing an ancient iconographic theme of almost worldwide currency, again executed in relief, showing a bird of prey attacking a quadruped, probably a deer Below this a similarly time-honoured theme, a procession of animals of the hunt, is set against foliate scrolls, typical for the decorative repertoire of a local workshop which conceivably employed craftsmen belonging to one of the monotheistic religions of the Near East, where this sheath is thought to have been made for a Christian, probably crusader, client 237 In contradistinction however to the dragon-slaying motif on the scabbard decoration, the quillon block of the accompanying dagger, both preserved in the Furusiyya Art Collection, Vaduz, extends into downwardcurving prongs that terminate in dragon heads, a feature frequently employed on quillon blocks and imbued with an inherent apotropaic function 238 However, the rendering of the dragon heads is already highly stylised, perhaps suggesting that the heads had lost some of their original protective quality to become a more decorative feature
standard iconography with a pretzel-like knot at mid-section followed by a further loop A pair of flying figures hovers over the canopy of the rider in a sign of glorification A three-line inscription in Syriac as well as in Arabic associates the stele with the Christian minority and gives the date, 701/1301–2, as well as the name of the master, Ibn Bahri 233 Given that it is utilised as a symbol of victory in a funerary context, the presence of the dragon-slaying motif on this stele appears to echo the popular eschatological notions of the wall painting above the entrance of yılanlı kilise in the Ihlara valley 234 The iconographic semantics of the equestrian dragon-fighter – from the greater Khurasan region to Asia Minor – in its heroic as well as saintly incarnation, thus owe much to ancient prototypes that germinated in the syncretistic melting pot of the great Near Eastern religions These were probably inspired to a large extent by ancient Iranian dualist notions, and specifically eschatological thought systems, which resulted in close parallels between Iranian and Jewish concepts, inherited, in turn, by Christianity 235 As can be seen in both material culture and written sources, there is overwhelming evidence that the figure of the Iranian holy rider battling the dragon (more rarely also visualised as fighting on foot) largely served to articulate the many strands of this complex image The latter thus informed a visual vocabulary that proved to be meaningful as an internationally recognisable symbol for adherents of different religions in the medieval Central Asian sphere As a consequence it allowed for effortless re-contextualisation and seems to have served as connecting symbol between different cultural and religious spheres on a popular level, in some ways coming to symbolise a cultural syncretism These strong syncretistic aspects are evident on a twelfth- or thirteenth-century nielloed silver



the dragon in relation to royal or heroic figures 111
a Royal and heroic associations of the dragon in literary accounts
In Iranian legends the dragon combat was one of the wonders and heroic feats required as proof of the king’s or hero’s legitimacy, so becoming by extension an important device of royal or heroic ideology 1 A royal victory over the dragon was intended to manifest virtuous conduct and to endow the royal persona with heroic qualities The visual enactment of this victory communicated mastery over the mighty mythical creature as well as implying metaphorically that through this deed of prowess the vanquisher was able to take on the formidable qualities of the dragon, that is to say, assume part of the dragon’s nature, as will be shown below Just as in the visual arts the dragon’s powerful likeness was evoked, so it served also in literature as a simile in the formulation of praise and panegyric for rulers and their entourage Drawing on the dragon’s qualities of instilling fear and dread as well as awe and reverence, the creature was evoked metaphorically as a lively expression of the heroic qualities of the mamdūḥ (“the praised one”) Repetitive reference to the dragon was thus a rhetorical device used by poets and historians, among them Firdawsī, the celebrated poet from a village near Ṭūs, near present-day Mashhad in Khurasan, who began writing the Shāh-nāma during the last decade of Samanid sovereignty and completed it during the rule of the Ghaznawids The latter were ethnically Turkish but were deeply imbued with the Persian and Islamic courtly traditions In the opening verses, Firdawsī eulogises the royal patron, sulṭān Maḥmūd of Ghazna (r 389/999–421/1030), with the words:
At his banquets (bazm), he is a heaven of fidelity In combat (razm), he is a dragon with sharp claws 2
By thus creating a visual image like a frieze or bas-relief, the court poet uses his skill to publicly display and celebrate the virtues and accomplishments of the patron 3 Firdawsī’s flattering rhetoric is echoed by that of the foremost panegyric poets at the Ghaznawid court, Abu ’l-Ḥasan Farrukhī Sīstānī (d 429/1037–8), who called his royal patron an “illuminating sun” at banquets and a “roaring dragon” in combat 4 The imagery of the dragon seems to have represented a heroic ideal and was frequently used in panegyrics in the Qābūs-nāma (“Book of Qābūs”), written in 475/1082–3 by the Ziyārid prince ʿUnṣur al-Maʿālī Kay Kāwūs ibn Iskandar ibn Qābūs, for the edification of his son In this well-known “Mirror for Princes” the 63-year-old prince remarks upon the fashion for court poets to liken the “mighty” to a “dragon” or a “lion;” urging his son to weigh carefully such eulogies 5 Dragon symbolism was not only reserved for the sulṭān; Manūchihrī Dāmghānī, poet at the court of Maḥmūd’s successor, sulṭān Masʿūd of Ghazna (r 421/1030–432/1040), also performed services for the sulṭān’s chief vizier, Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Ṣamad, by extravagantly praising his virtues in an ode (qaṣīda) in which he too calls upon the symbolic meaning of the dragon:
With such petty enemies why should the Khwājah do battle? The dragon is shamed who fights with a chameleon 6
That this metaphorical or allegorical use of the dragon image was in widespread currency is further attested by its use in a qaṣīda by Ẓahīr al-Dīn al-Fāryābī (550/1156–598/1201–2; as indicated by his nisba he was perhaps born at Fāryāb near Balkh) In his dīwān the poet glorifies the courage of the last Great Saljuq ruler in the west, sulṭān Ṭoghrıl III ibn Arslan with the words:

When his enemies saw his dragon countenance They raised their hands above their heads like scorpions 7
In a dramatic double simile in the Iskandar-nāma, Niẓāmī brings together the heroic qualities of the dragon with those of the lion to describe:
an Alan knight, similar to a fierce lion, [who] came forth like a black dragon, with a mace in his hand, hard to bear for less than seventy men and able to split Mt Alborz 8
The mythical creatures are thus invoked in order to endow the subject of eulogies, by association, with praiseworthy superhuman qualities In the Haft Paykar Niẓāmī again jointly invokes the lion and the dragon in the allegorical description of king Bahrām seizing the crown from between two lions:
The golden crown in two black lions’ jaws as in two dragons’ jaws a (lustrous) moonA moon escaping with a basin’s noise the cloud, but the basin eke a sword, The two vindictive lions lashed their tails upon the ground like dragons twain (in wrath); To say, Who’ll seize from us this golden crown? Who’ll dare a lion or a dragon rob? They knew not of that man of iron heart, who captured lions, dragons hunted too 9
Firdawsī evokes related heroic imagery in the Shāh-nāma in the story of the demon Akwān who at royal command was slain by Rustam who himself is repeated likened to a dragon 10 The hero assures the king that “whether demon, lion or male dragon, it will not escape my sharp sword,” and is himself described as arriving at the battle scene “like a male lion riding a dragon ”11 The court poet Masʿūd-i Rāzī was exiled to India by the Ghaznawid sulṭān Masʿūd ibn Maḥmūd for daring to admonish the sulṭān during the festival of Mihragān in Dhu ’l-Ḥijjah 430/September 1039 with the lines:
your enemies were ants, but now they have become vipers; hasten to destroy these ants turned vipers
Give them no more time, and do not tarry, for if given time a viper will become a dragon 12
Similar allegorical language is also used in the History of the Saljuqs by Ibn Bībī (d after 684/ December 1285) who referred to rebellious youths as “young serpents that grow into dragons”13 and likened the victorious Saljuqs to “threatening dragons ”14 Rustam, the legendary prince of Sistān, is conspicuous for his role in the battles with his archenemy Afrāsīyāb, the legendary king of Tūrān in the Iranian epic In the “Book of Qay Qubād” of Firdawsī’s Shāh-nāma, his father Zāl however warns him about going to war with the Tūrānian who is identified as a Turk and as a powerful “male dragon”:
Zāl told him, “Listen my son Today, for once, think hard: In war, this Turk is a male dragon In skirmish and in combat he is a cloud of calamity 15
In literary tradition the dragon is hence used to emphasise the heroes’ and rulers’ superhuman qualities by allegorically transforming them into dragons whose likeness was often singled out as apt symbol of royalty and superiority 16 This is also noticeable in the visual language, for instance on a large marble slab relief-carved with addorsed regardant “Saljuq-style” dragons in rampant posture with forelegs and unfolded wings Significant are their long interlaced tails Their open mouths reveal enormous fangs with long bifid tongues thrust out, their forelegs with separated talon-toed paws rest on their long upward-curving sinuous tails The plaque carries an epigraphic band inscribed with the formula al-sulṭān al-muʿaẓẓam (“the exalted sultan”), a title held by the Saljuqs (fig 112) It comes from the cenotaph of the Mamlūk ruler al-Muʾayyad Sayf al-Dīn Shaykh (d 1421/824) in Cairo, which Max van Berchem has identified as (much earlier) spoils from the sulṭān’s Mesopotamian campaigns17 and for which Rogers suggests an Anatolian Saljuq provenance 18 The inscription

explicitly identifies the iconography of the paired dragons as a royal ensign of a now anonymous sulṭān It is interesting to note the analogy of this type of imagery to the stone reliefs at the türbe of Emir Saltuq at Erzurum (fig 10) and at the church of Saint Gregory in Ani (fig 11) Closely related interlaced dragons are depicted on portable items such as the twelfth-century gold finger ring from the greater Khurasan region (fig 30) where they served to strengthen the protective function of the objects, and were chosen as emblematic motifs west of Iran for the coinage of twelfth- or thirteenth-century rulers in the Jazīra (figs 32a and b) This spolium is evidence that not only did the motif of the interlaced dragons prove to be meaningful beyond the Central Asian realm but that the iconography could be re-contextualised in a fifteenth-century Mamlūk setting where it was distinguished as an emblem that was deemed suitable for inclusion in a royal funerary setting

Dragon symbolism and cosmic rulership
Artistic representations developed during the ʿAbbasid period projected an idealised vision of rulership which included the creation of physical manifestations of their imperial pursuits, in particular with respect to court ritual Iranian influence on court ceremonial (marasīm) became noticable reflecting “the profound iranisation of customs and society ”19 Considerable importance was attached to the throne (sarīr, kursī) The caliph sat on a throne placed on a dais (ṣuffa) when he presided over court ceremonies Iranian features in these ceremonies sometimes included the caliph’s elevation on a raised platform or throne (Pers takht), rather than just a dais 20 These influences were notice
able beyond the caliphal court According to the tenth-century philosopher Miskawayh, the ambitious Ziyārid ruler Mardāwīj ibn Ziyār (d 323/935) was imitating Sasanian custom when he sat on a golden throne and wore a crown 21 The historian Abu ’l-Faḍl Bayhaqī (d 470/1077), recorded in his Taʾrīkh-i Masʿūdī (“History of Masʿūd”) that the Ghaznawid sulṭān Masʿūd ibn Maḥmūd held court sitting on a dais and in 429/1038 had his throne, originally made of wood, replaced by a golden, jewel-studded throne, three years in the making, that he placed on a dais in his new palace 22 In the manner of the Sasanian kings he had a seventy-man crown suspended from golden chains 23 The grandeur of the house of the Ghaznawids was, in the words of Bayhaqī, “resplendent as the sun ”24 The twelfth-century Khurasani poet Awḥad al-Dīn Muḥammad Anwarī (c 520/1126–583/1187–8 or 585/118990), who was born near Abīward, had served sulṭān Sanjar ibn Malik Shāh and survived the collapse of the Great Saljuqs, expresses similar metaphorical notions for the enthroned sovereign:
May the world be your servant and destiny your page The sky your throne and the sun your crown 25
His words aptly express the celestial and solar associations of royal ideology, areas in which the dragon theme played an important role The conventional medieval Islamic depiction of rulership shows a frontally rendered human figure, the head in three-quarter view, seated cross-legged on a raised platform between two poles, which serve as the arms of the “chair,” and which are topped by dragon heads, their wide-open jaws revealing tongues commonly oriented towards the head of the human figure The figure is often shown with arms extended at either side, grasping the staffs just below the dragon heads At times he holds a staff in one hand and what looks like a cup in the other, imagery suggestive of cosmic kingship 26

[and by analogy] were seen as symbols of paradise that Islam promised to all true believers” 32 This association was already pointed out by Xenophon in his Kynegetikos (XII 1); see Davidson, “Haft kvān,” EIr 33 Tr and ed Mohl, 1838–1878, vol 3, p 358, ll 782–3 34 Reading after Ettinghausen, 1943, p 196 Cf MelikianChirvani, 1982, pp 71, 82–3, n 61; Ward, 1993, p 74, fig 54 35 Melikian-Chirvani, 1982, p 83, n 62 36 Cf idem, p 71 and p 83, n 62
The visual expression is particularly prevalent on mid-eleventh to thirteenth-century silver-inlaid metalwork and seems to have first appeared on objects produced in the greater Khurasan region Dragon-headed staffs flanking this traditional medieval Islamic portrayal of rulership are portrayed in one of eight roundels on the lid of the covered copper alloy bowl, inlaid with silver, known as the Vaso Vescovali, made in the Khurasan region around 1200 27 The “ruler on a dragon-throne” is in turn symmetrically flanked by attendants while the dais is supported by a pair of addorsed feline protomes (fig 113) 28 Since the other roundels enclose representations of the seven conventional planets, the depiction in the eighth roundel has been associated with the pseudo-planet jawzahar, illustrating here the eighth “planet ”29 The earliest dated instance of the “dragonthrone” is found on the 559/1163 Bobrinski bucket, where it is repeated four times in the main register separated by an epigraphic frieze of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic naskhī, the lower parts of the hastae often terminating in dragon and other animal heads, expressing good wishes for the owner (fig 114) 30 These roundels are encircled by 28 radiating “rays,” alternately inlaid in silver and copper The frieze is the uppermost of a series of three figurative registers that circumscribe the richly inlaid copper alloy bucket It is interesting to investigate these dense pictographic friezes since they provide the wider context for the “ruler on a dragon-throne” iconography The second register encloses figures engaged in various popular pastimes ranging from backgammon and banqueting to making music and fighting with staves The third features a hunting party with several bow-bending, sword- or lance-wielding figures on horseback and on foot involved in fighting and hunting, depicted amidst animals in flight or in pursuit and mythical creatures such as a sphinx and a dragon, which will
be further discussed below The second and third registers thus contain pictorial cycles visualising the outward declarations of very ancient Iranian royal pursuits: feasting or celebration (bazm) and hunting or fighting (razm) Such motifs, representing royal pleasures and pastimes, were evidently transmitted directly from Sasanian art 31 Within the Islamic cultural sphere hunting, feasting and fighting, considered the best preparation for war, are again important themes 32 These activities were associated with heroic figures, as is the case with Rustam in the Shāh-nāma:
Thus did Rustam ordain a banquet For he was one that ordains banquets (bazm) And that makes war (razm) 33
The rim of the bucket is circumscribed by a silverinlaid inscription in Persian, which reads:
Ordered by ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Rashīdī, made by Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wāḥid, worked by ḥājib Masʿūd ibn Aḥmad the decorator of Herāt, for the exalted khwāja Rukn al-Dīn, the pride of the merchants, the most trustworthy of the faithful, grace of the pilgrimage and of [its] two shrines, Rāshīd al-Dīn ʿAzīzī, ibn Abu ’l-Ḥusayn al-Zanjānī, may his glory be lasting 34
On account of the kind of eulogies offered to the dedicatee and the date recorded on the object, the month of Muḥarram, during which the pilgrimage is performed, Assadullah Souren MelikianChirvani suggests that “the gift consecrated a collective ḥajj led by the dignitary The gift of a bucket used to contain water, perhaps for ritual ablutions, would have been appropriate ”35 Evidently, the choice of the “ruler on a dragonthrone” motif on the bucket was part of an iconographic repertoire deemed suitable for an official gift perhaps to be offered by a religious community to a dignitary, whose nisba indicates that he may have been from Zanjān in northwestern Persia 36 However, since the other blessings inscribed on the bucket are directed at an anony

mous owner, it may be surmised that such luxury objects were designed for the market, with special inscriptions only being added to the rim or handle after purchase 37 Hence, one may presume that the “ruler on a dragon-throne” roundels which were so prominently displayed on the bucket were an iconographic theme which was meaningful and would have been understood by most potential clients The motif also occurs on eleventh- or twelfthcentury objects of adornment, for example on a small, circular copper alloy pendant inlaid with silver reportedly from Herat in presentday Afghanistan The pendant shows a human figure, the features of his moon-shaped face and the folds of his voluminous pantaloons finely incised, seated cross-legged on a “throne” flanked on either side by upright rods terminating in snarling dragon heads, and in turn by tall vessels Here the “throne” is decorated at the centre with a pendant palmette, flanked on either side by horizontally-oriented half-palmettes The reverse is decorated with a long-legged bird of prey attacking a hare that turns its head towards the bird A zigzag border, giving the impression of solar rays, frames the scene 38 Analogous iconography of the seated figure flanked symmetrically by dragon-headed staffs is employed on several other pieces of metalwork, such as a late twelfth- or early thirteenth-century copper alloy inkwell inlaid with silver also from northern Afghanistan, formerly in the Minassian Collection, New york (fig 115) The figure, in a flat headdress from which seem to descend long fluttering ends, appears on the base of the inkwell in the same iconographical setting, his raised arms grasping dragon-headed staffs The latter, in turn, are symmetrically flanked here by a pair of birds, instead of by palmettes as shown in the previous example or by attendants as on the Vaso Vescovali The roundel is again set into a radiant frame, presumably conveying solar significance 39 This equating of the ruler with the Sun goes back to the pre-Islamic concept of the
divine glory conferred upon the king The solar aspect of ancient Iranian kingship was associated with the Zoroastrian belief in the Iranian royal and divine attribute of farr, often rendered as farr-i kayānī, “the glory of the Kays (the ancient dynasty of Iran),” the distinctive hereditary mark of Iranian legitimacy 40 This may also be reflected in the Turkic convention of altun khān (qaghan), the “golden ruler ”41 The tenth-century Khwārazmian scholar al-Bīrūnī records that on the festival of Mihragān, the Sasanian king wore a radiant crown to resemble the Zoroastrian god Mihr, lord of the sun 42 The same scene is rendered on another inlaid copper-alloy inkwell of the same period, which features a cross-legged figure crowned by a pointed headdress and flanked by dragon-headed staffs whose gaping mouths have particularly long tongues oriented towards the figure’s head Importantly, in this example the dragons’ undulant bodies descend diagonally from the staffs and thus directly associate the depiction with the entire body of the dragon, rather than – as shown above – with the staff mutating at the tip into a dragon head 43 If the imagery should be seen as bearing some astrological meaning, the latter could also be interpreted as an abbreviated reference to the astrological “head” (raʾs) and the “tail” (dhanab) of the dragon (fig 116) 44 A point of resemblance with the motifs discussed above (figs 113–116) occurs on seventhcentury stamp seals which depict a crudely rendered standing ithyphallic figure with arms and legs outstretched; the arms holding two upright staffs around which serpents are wound and which are topped by stellar motifs or birds 45 Phyllis Ackerman has associated this imagery both with the astronomical sign Serpentarius and with Gayūmart (Av gaya marətan “mortal life”), the mythical first man of the Mazdean creation myth The latter was considered a semi-divine giant who stood between gods and men 46 A different reading is offered by Marian Wenzel who attempts to link the motif of a seated or standing figure hold

ing up serpent staffs with the process of firemaking 47 yet the figure grasping staffs entwined with serpents and topped by birds or stellar symbols could indeed represent a mythical giant holding what might perhaps represent abbreviated visual formulae of a vegetal motif characterised as the “Tree of Life” with serpent motif 48 This interpretation gains weight through a depiction on a floor mosaic discovered in the nave of a church at Huarte, located fifteen kilometres north of Apamea in present-day Syria, and dated by inscription to the years 472 or 487 49 On the central axis of the pavement close to the sanctuary is the large frontally rendered figure of Adam, identified by an inscription above his head He is portrayed as fully clothed and enthroned on a backless raised platform, leaning against a cushion, and holding an open book in his left hand, while extending the fingers of his right hand in a gesture of speech Importantly, he is framed by two slender cypress trees around each of which is coiled a serpent, its head oriented towards Adam’s head, the open jaws revealing bifid tongues Adam is surrounded by a variety of tame beasts and birds set amidst flowering vegetation indicating that the setting is the primordial Paradise before the Fall (fig 117) 50 Since the image does not accord with the book of Genesis – Adam being represented not naked but clothed, enthroned and reading a book – Henry Maguire has proposed reading this paradisical scene not in a literal but a spiritual sense as allegory 51 Precedent for such an interpretation is found in the notion of the Robe of Glory, which is commonly found in the writings of the early Syriac fathers and ultimately derives from early Jewish sources 52 The imagery is repeatedly used in the hymns of the fourthcentury Syriac writer Ephrem, deacon in Edessa and Nisibis, who equates the white robes of those baptised with the Robes of Glory (which he also
reads as Robes of Light) lost by Adam and Eve at the Fall but regained through baptism which is understood eschatologically as re-entry into Paradise 53 Hence the scene may be understood as depicting the robed Adam not only as ruler over the world54 but as an image of one who through Christ has discovered the state of divine wisdom and glory 55 In sum, it may be noted that Adam, the first of men of the biblical creation myth, is represented just like Gayūmart, the mythical first man of the Mazdean creation myth, between two slender elongated plants around which coil serpents whose heads are oriented towards the central figure On the late fifth-century Huarte mosaic the association of the cedars in the paradisical setting with the Tree of Life is apparent, whereas on the seventh-century stamp seals the staff-like motifs may presumably represent abbreviated visual formulae; the addition of the birds or stellar symbols at the apex of these verticals give further substance to this interpretation 56 It may thus be postulated that both depictions portray a central figure flanked on either side by a serpent-entwined Tree of Life motif Ackerman has moreover noted an astronomical association for the imagery on the stamp seals 57 The conventional medieval Islamic representation of rulership features enthroned figures flanked by dragon-headed or dragon-entwined staffs; the iconography occurring predominantly on mid-eleventh to thirteenth-century silver-inlaid metalwork produced in the greater Khurasan region (figs 113–116) Since these are often framed by a disc with pointed rays, Eva Baer has interpreted them as artistic formulae of princely or royal images transposed in a sense to a cosmic setting, and as emblematised luminaries, or panegyrical visual expressions of the “heavenly ruler,” which sometimes have an astrological

character 58 An anecdote attesting to the astral qualities of the ruler in the face of the dragon is noted by Ibn Bībī, the Rūm Saljuq chronicler, in which he metaphorically likens the meeting of the armies of the Khwārazm-shāh and the Rūm Saljuqs to the day on which:
... in accordance to servile custom the King of the Planets kissed the earth at the door of the King of the World and the encounter of the troops of the War-Dragon unfurled the crimson and yellow banner at the arena of the horizons 59
Luminary imagery is similarly used to describe the birth of Khurshīd shāh in one of the earliest Persian popular romances, the Kitāb-i Samak ʿAyyār, who throughout the story is portrayed in terms of solar metaphors and is even named “king Sun ”60 In sum, it may be stated that the visual tradition of the medieval Islamic representation of rulership involves the imagery of a central figure flanked by serpent-dragons that top or twine around verticals which might carry a vegetal association that could distantly associate them with the Tree of Life motif as ultimate prototype Frequently the vertical is shown only with a projecting dragon head This may thus present yet another example of the visual conflation that was so pervasive in the medieval Central Asian world and beyond It would be an example of a visual development that merges the figure of the dragon with that of the staff in a unified whole The Tree of Life motif exhibited a remarkable persistence and popularity in Near Eastern and Indo-European61 iconography which, as has been discussed above, could still be gauged in visual and textual sources of the eleventh to thirteenth century, the period when this imagery was employed with great regularity 62 This supports the hypothesis that the prototype of the vertical may be sought in a vegetal composition It is moreover notable that the central figure often grasps with one or two hands the verticals just below the point from which the dragon heads project To this may be added the luminary asso
ciation which transposes the motif to a cosmic setting – sometimes with an astrological character The pivotal role the dragon plays in these images will be further elucidated in the following, concluding in a discussion of the time-honoured symbolism of the dragon-tamer
Issuing and devouring
The iconography of a human figure, sometimes reduced to the image of a mask-like face, flanked on either side by dragons, was one of “great symbolic potency” in the Central Asian world and beyond and existed in manifold variations 63 The monsters not only frame the central motif but on account of their gaping jaws at first sight appear to threaten or perhaps even attempt to devour what they flank The possibility of the latter interpretation will be discussed in the light of surviving examples of this enigmatic imagery The motif is prominently recorded in the visual arts of the Caucasus region, for instance on the Armenian cathedral of the Holy Apostles in present-day Kars erected by king Abas I between 930 and 943 in the adjacent secondary Bagratid kingdom of Vanand, near the border with eastern Anatolia On the exterior of the drum above the blind arcades twelve full-length figures are carved in low relief that in folk tradition are associated with the twelve apostles The figures have masklike faces and are clad in long robes In what is perhaps a unique occurrence, some are shown to raise their bent arms upwards, others place their hands on their chests, in what may have represented ritually significant gestures and may have conveyed a canonical koiné 64 It is conceivable that the sequence of the movements played a role and even alluded to a visual narrative 65 One of the figures is flanked by a tree-like vegetal composition 66 Next to it is a figure with a looped serpent rising up at either side of his upper body, the heads oriented towards his ears Significantly, the figure does not extend his arms towards the serpents but

has the hands placed, one above the other, on his chest (fig 118) 67 The repetition of the motif above the northwestern port-hole window (“oculus”) of the church underlines the importance accorded to this iconography Here, instead of a full-length figure a frontally presented human bust flanked by giant looped serpents is portrayed (fig 119) 68 Several interpretations have been proposed for the enigmatic reliefs The portrayals are particularly puzzling since as decoration on a church façade they can be assumed to represent overall propitious and apotropaic motifs yet the readings of the figure flanked by serpents, in particular, have only multiplied the mystery One explanation identifies the figure as Saint Gregory the Illuminator during his imprisonment in the snake-infested Khor Virap (“deep dungeon”) 69 Another tentative suggestion is that the representation preserves an echo of the ancient myth of the Armenian dragon-fighter Hruden (the Avestan Thraētaona) who chained Azhi Dahāka 70 On the cathedral of the Holy Apostles in Kars, the figure is shown flanked by two serpents An iconographical schema involving two serpents that grow out of the shoulders of a human figure was perhaps still known in medieval Armenia,
where even after Christianisation vestiges of the Zoroastrian faith – in which this was a wellknown form of imagery – continued to survive In later Zoroastrian Pahlawī/Middle Persian sources (which were written down in the ninth century but incorporated material from third century ad writings and before), the formidable Avestan dragon Azhi Dahāka is transformed into an early Iranian historicised foreign king, Azhdahāk, or, as he is named in New Persian or Arabic narratives, Ẓaḥḥāk (al-Ḍaḥḥāk/Dahāk) According to an account in the Shāh-nāma, the dragon-king Ẓaḥḥāk was not originally evil but when Ahriman (Av Angra Mainyu), the demonic half of ancient Zoroastrian dualist myth, tempted him, kissing his shoulders, a pair of serpents sprang from the place the Spirit of Evil had touched These serpents, a reminiscence of Ẓaḥḥāk’s original reptilian nature, had to be fed the brains of young men every day, binding him to the perpetual sacrifice of humans, who eventually rebelled and overthrew him 71 An early example of the motif of a human figure with snakes growing out of each shoulder may be sought in greater Mesopotamia, where it is expressed in the figure of the chthonian god Nergal72 whose iconography may per

Qazwīnī in Āthār al-bilād wa-akhbār al-ʿibād (“Monuments of the Countries and History of their Inhabitants”), 437, 9–10, which states that serpents grew from the shoulders of the ṣūfī Sheikh al-Kammūnī (from whom al-Qazwīnī traces direct descent through five generations) in order to overturn the power of an unjust ruler See von Hees, 2002, pp 36–7, 45 81 Russell, 1987, p 44 See Zaehner, 1961, pp 134–7, esp p 140; Boyce, 1975, repr 1996, pp 92–5 and n 69 82 Russell, 1987, p 44 83 Buzandaran Patmutʿiwnkʿ, tr Garsoïan, 1989, p 202; Russell, 2004, p 62, n 36, and p 130 84 According to the Buzandaran, once when the king was young his mother entered his room [whilst he was engaged in sodomy] and saw that white snakes had twisted themselves around him (V22); tr Garsoïan, 1989, p 165 Cf Russell, 2004, pp 341–2 85 In the Christian apocalypse, Satan as the Devil is called the “great dragon” and “ancient serpent” (Revelation 12 9 and 20 2) The use of the serpent as a symbol of Evil is exemplified, for instance, by a homily on the Armenian martyr Saint Sergios by Severus of Antioch, delivered at Chalcis on 1 October 514: “We must be watchful against Satan, the snake who with sleepless eye fixed on our heels lies waiting to push us into the pit of sin by our love for pleasure, such as stuffing one’s belly,” as cited in Fowden, 1999, p 23
haps have been appropriated for the depiction of yima, the Indo-Iranian “first man,”73 who in the Iranian tradition becomes the ruler of the underworld after his death,74 as well as in much earlier Mesopotamian75 and Bronze Age Central Asian deities 76 It also appears in archaic Greek literature as shown by Hesiod’s anthropomorphic drakōn Typhaon/Typhon who is described as having a hundred snake heads growing from his shoulders (Theogony 825–626) Material evidence of this visual expression is found mainly in Western Central Asia and the Caucasus 77 A large terracotta figure, probably made in seventhor eighth-century Sogdia, thus before Islam had become firmly entrenched as the principal faith in the region, shows an enthroned crowned man, large-headed and with grinning mouth, from the base of whose neck a pair of serpents grow, curving upwards and around his ears before descending down to his cheeks The man’s left hand is clasped to his chest while his raised right hand clenches a now lost object, perhaps a staff 78 As James Russell notes, it is unlikely that the figure represented an epic monster Rather is it a supernatural figure that probably fulfilled an apotropaic function 79 The symbolism of an anthropomorphic figure with serpents springing from the shoulders is thus characterised by an element of ambiguity that allows for a multilayered interpretation 80 Russell remarks upon this ambiguity when he discusses the role of yima about whom “Zoroastrian tradition preserves two separate narratives ; in
one he dies and goes down to live in a happy underground abode, while in the other version, he commits sin, wanders unhappy and dies [Shāhnāma] ”81 He therefore proposes that the motif of “Azhi Dahāka in the epic is contaminated by an image of yima [the Jamshīd of the much later Shāh-nāma] appropriated from Nergal ([related by inference to] Ẓaḥḥāk [who] succeeds Jamshīd in the Shāh-nāma) ”82
It is interesting that a closely related motif was chosen in the anonymous fifth-century Armenian Buzandaran Patmutʿiwnkʿ which portrays the unfortunate Armenian king Pap (369–374) as having serpents that sprang from his breasts (though not from his shoulders) and wove themselves around his shoulders (IV 44) 83 According to the historian this was because the king was possessed by demons The choice of symbolism may also be associated with the fact that the king, who was later assassinated by the Romans, had antagonised the Christian clergy and, in addition, had been accused of homosexuality 84 The description of king Pap with serpents may perhaps reflect the reformulation of the beneficial aspect of the dragon when it acquired an overall symbolic meaning as a satanic force in Christian imagery 85 The inversion of the beneficial association is graphically articulated in the later socalled “revenge miniatures” of the eleventh- or early twelfth-century Byzantine Metaphrastian Menologion volumes, in which persecuting pagan

86 When a first word of a Passion was the name of an emperor who had martyred a saint, the evil ruler might be depicted in the initial letter as being strangled by a serpent (Patterson Ševčenko, 1990, p 193), emperors or crowned figures may be encircled by a serpent (eadem, p 90), or, as in the case of the Roman emperor Trajan, portrayed as holding a serpent in his hand (eadem, p 155) 87 Cf Garsoïan, 1994, p 11 88 It is interesting to note that comparable mask-like heads, similarly cut off immediately above the neck, appear on several Armenian sacred buildings dating from the tenth to the thirteenth century They appear for instance among the vine branches at the Armenian church of the Holy Cross at Aghtʿamar, a few are included among the animal friezes, and two continuous rows of mask-like human female and male heads appear under the eaves on the north and south walls of the west exedra of the church (Der Nersessian, 1965, p 26, figs 16, 40) Sirarpie Der Nersessian has identified these schematic heads as follow
ing the tradition of Iranian motifs seen to decorate the Parthian palace of Hatra in the Mesopotamian desert (cf Ghirshman, 1962, p 36, fig 49), which were also discovered at Hamadan (ancient Ecbatana) and at Qum south of Tehran (cf idem, p 38, fig 52), which originally had an apotropaic character but became an ornamental motif in the classical period (Der Nersessian, 1965, p 26) 89 Khalʿpakhʿchian, 1980, pp 173–4, fig 6 (line drawing of three reliefs), fig 8 (forth relief) Russell, 2004, p 560 and n 21, p 631, pp 1168, 1181, pl 3 90 As cited in Khalʿpakhʿchian, 1980, p 164 91 For a discussion of the significance of the rosette motif in the early Persian, Sasanian and Umayyad period, see Ettinghausen, 1972, pp 36–41 92 Khalʿpakhʿchian, 1980, p 164 On the Armenian shahapets, see p 56, n 66 93 Der Nersessian, 1973, pp 6–9, 85–6, pl C and figs 13–29; for the ornate initial of the Gospel of Matthew, see fig 34
tyrant rulers who had martyred Christian saints were depicted with a serpent as a symbol of evil 86 What appears to be an abbreviated formula or contracted version of the motif of the fulllength human figure or bust flanked by two serpents as shown on the tenth-century cathedral of the Holy Apostles in Kars (figs 118 and 119), is found three times on the façade of the central monument of the fortified monastic complex of Tatʿev, located in Siunikʿ province in southeastern Armenia The church, dedicated to the Saints Paul and Peter (Surb Poghos Petros), was constructed by the order of prince Ashotʿ of Siunikʿ under the supervision of bishop Ter Hohannes between 895 and 906 87 Erected nearly half a century earlier than the imagery on the cathedral of the Holy Apostles in Kars, three frontally rendered masklike heads are framed on either side by horizontally oriented dragons whose bodies form a single loop On the eastern façade of the Paul and Peter church the human heads with prominent ears88 are flanked by long slender pairs of dragons, while on the northern façade a crowned moustachioed head is framed by two shorter and more voluminous dragons All of the creatures are portrayed with mouths ajar, revealing a row of sharp teeth as well as projecting tongues, which touch the ears of the heads 89 The Armenian historian Stepʿanos Ōrbēlian has interpreted the heads as belonging to the donors of the church; the mustachioed head on the north façade, Grigor Supan, the ruler of Gegharkʿunikʿ (fig 120), as well as the two heads on the east façade, prince Ashotʿ (fig 121) and his wife Shushan (fig 122) 90 The head identified as that of princess Shushan is framed by shoul
der-length tresses Her head is surmounted by a large composite star-rosette that has an elaborate centre, from which radiates one row of cusped petals, which may have conveyed a special significance, possibly with astral or royal connotations 91 Khalʿpakhʿchian has suggested a protective function of the motif of the human head between dragons, since the latter are regarded by Armenians as protectors of homes (shahapets), serpent genii of places 92 The widespread use of the symbol of openmouthed dragons flanking a human head is also attested by its use in twelfth-century Armenian manuscripts It is shown as an element attached to ornate initials, such as in the loop of the initial in the Cilician Gospels of Luke and of Matthew (Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery Ms 538), written in 1193 for the Bishop Ter Karapet, at the monastery of Paughoskan near the fortress of Katen in the region of Mlich (fig 123) 93 Here the masklike human head is bracketed by dragon heads, which, like those flanking the heads at Tatʿev, are similarly portrayed with open jaws ending in prominently curled-up tips The theme of symmetrically doubled dragons flanking a human head appears on other threedimensional constructions recorded in the Islamic world, such as at the thirteenth-century caravanserai Susuz Han, dated c 644/1246, situated near Bucak, examined above At the khān the symbolism is shown twice, mirrored above two muqarnas niches flanking the main portal, effectively once again doubling the visual impact of the potent motif (fig 124, detail of one muqarnas niche) Just like the above-discussed Armenian dragon heads, those at Susuz Han are portrayed in the so-called “Saljuq-style ”

and their open snouts with curled tips emit what appears to be curving foliage See Thierry, 1987, p 408, fig 362 95 For a closely related marginal ornament, see the Gospel book, copied on paper, 275 fols , dated 1331, transcribed and illuminated in the village of Agheth (Bzhnunikʿ) by the scribe Hovhannes Kʿahanay (the priest) Mnatsakanyan, 1955, p 516, fig 1021
Paired dragons flanking a central motif are also featured on other architectural elements such as a thirteenth-century carved wooden door, discussed below, probably from the Tigris region, now preserved in the Museum für Islamische Kunst in Berlin The gaping “Saljuq-style” dragons’ mouths similarly flank a small central medallion that contains a heavily abraded motif, perhaps once representing a human bust (fig 153) Instead of a human head as central element held by open-mouthed dragons, the mythical creatures similarly flank an inscription, a vegetal composition or an animal head, for instance that of a bull or a lion The close link between the blessings expressed in an inscription and images of fructifying vegetation is evidenced in parallel depictions on the handles of the previously mentioned Bobrinski and Fould inlaid copper alloy buckets The handle loops of the former are made in the form of dragon protomes from whose gaping mouths spring the central foursided arched section Benedictory inscriptions appear in naskhī on two sides and in Kufic on the top band of the handle with the date muḥarram 559/December 1163 On the outside the loops are flanked by leaping lions (fig 56) The handle loops on the Fould bucket are made of arched dragons topped at the outside by projecting lionheaded knobs From the dragons’ open mouths emerges the six-sided arched handle, decorated on all facets with scrolling foliage in place of the benedictory inscriptions shown on the Bobrinsky handle (fig 57) In a similar manner an inverted pendant palmette is flanked by open-mouthed dragon heads inserted in the loop of the initial letter on the first page of a twelfth-century Armenian Gospel of Matthew (fig 125) Further related imagery is shown in a marginal ornament portrayed in the important Mush Homiliary, discussed earlier, transcribed and illuminated at the monastery of Avagvankʿ near Erznga(n) in northeastern Anatolia in 1200 to 1202 94 In this illumination the excessively long looped ophidian bodies of two dragons form a pretzel-like knot at mid-section (fig 126) 95 Their wide-open mouths revealing sharp teeth are oriented upwards, and in place
of the tongues, the creatures emit vegetal scrolls bearing split palmettes and buds The dragons’ mouths thus seem to emit the foliage This forms an interlaced composition surmounting the pretzel-knot which in turn intertwines with the ophidian bodies The same manuscript yields further initial letters and marginal ornaments with variations of the same theme An example of the former are two dragons in mirror image springing from vegetation and touching the foliage with the tips of their outstretched tongues (fig 127) and of the latter, a closely-related imagery showing the beasts touching each other’s tongue tips (fig 128); correspondingly, a scrolling vegetal stalk bearing palmettes and split-palmettes is shown with a single dragon head growing out of the foliage and biting into the stalk at mid-section (fig 129) yet another analogous motif is represented by the previously discussed relief sculptures on the stone minaret buttresses of the mid-thirteenthcentury Çifte Minare madrasa at Erzurum However here a pair of dragon protomes issues from the stem of a palm tree in such a way that they come to flank the central vegetation with its small birds and the double-headed eagle at its apex (fig 43) As has been shown above, in lieu of an inscription or vegetation dragons with gaping mouths flank Christian crosses on architectural representations such as on the vishap-type khatchkʿar (fig 46) or on the lintel of a door at the Monastery of Deir Mār Behnām in Mosul (figs 17 a and b, 50) as well as on ornaments in Cilician Armenian Gospel books (figs 45 and 47) Hence it appears less likely that the dragons framing the Christian emblems are intended to be read as threatening or even less as ingesting the crosses It may rather be presumed that, conversely, as in the case of vegetation or benedictory inscriptions, the mythical creatures are depicted with crosses issuing from their mouths, perhaps suggesting the active association of the dragons with this symbol of spiritual deliverance This would suggest a role for them not only as guardians but one may cautiously hypothesise perhaps even as rescuers or deliverers, drawing on associations with the idea of Christ the Saviour and Deliverer

By analogy, should the imagery of dragons flanking and apparently emitting crosses carry a positive symbolism, then this would have implications for other motifs in the same position The closely related theme of symmetrically doubled dragons flanking a central animal head survives on architectural compositions It appears on two of the round towers of the northern city wall of the medieval Armenian city of Ani, probably added under Shaddādid rule in the early twelfth century Here the creatures’ heads with gaping jaws, revealing rows of teeth and tongues with bifid tips, frame a bovine head that in one instance holds a ring in its mouth (fig 130) The dragons’ necks carry ornamental bands as collars The prominent depiction of the motif on the towers of the city walls certainly underlines its apotropaic intent It may be surmised that the bovine head flanked by dragon mouths is therefore not threatened by the devouring aspect of the dragons, but, contrarily, is presumably guarded and protected The Mush Homiliary yields further variations of the lion’s mask with paired dragon heads growing from or issuing vegetation The mythical creatures are shown joined to the mask with the help of a knotted vegetal interlace bearing split-palmettes and buds (fig 131) This is also modified to include paired human heads A marginal ornament shows the central lion mask to emit two leaves from its mouth which rise along either side reaching the mask’s crown and issue two human heads in profile (fig 132) 96 It is notable that the human profiles, drawn in clear outline with large almondshaped eyes, bulbous nose and receding chin, are closely comparable to the head of a sphinx marchant on a star tile from the now destroyed small palace at Kubadabad (built three decades after the inception of the paintings in the Homiliary), which is rendered with a similar tight-fitting headdress with pointed tip (fig 65) From the apex of the leonine mask spring further vegetal stalks bearing palmettes and foliage which terminate at the top in two confronted open-mouthed dragon heads whose projecting tongues touch the central stalk In the same manuscript the theme of paired dragons cum lion’s mask can be observed Significantly, this imagery takes the characteristic form of a pomegranate, a fruit which for its abundant seeds symbolises fertility and immortality both in
Armenia and throughout the Iranian world, thus underlining, once again, the auspicious character of the motif (fig 133) 97 A closely comparable visual formulation is found in the drawing of the brass door handles of al-Jazarī, intended for the palace door at Diyārbakr in southern Anatolia, which survives only in a copy of the original illustration and a description in the treatise on automata written by the master craftsman In the illustration the knockers are shown in the form of two confronted dragons with gaping mouths and outstretched tongues that frame the lion-headed knob (fig 134) The popularity and wide distribution of the theme of the lion’s mask with paired dragon heads is further underlined by its representation on architectural monuments such as the fine relief embellishing the upper corners just below the roof of the thirteenth-century church of Surb Karapet (John the Baptist) (1221–1227) on the east side of the monastic complex of Noravankʿ in Vayots Dzor in southern Armenia (fig 135) The complexity of the theme of confronted dragon heads is reflected in a zoomorphic composition at the monastic complex of Geghard, also known as Ayrivankʿ, in the mountainous region of Kotaykʿ, Armenia, that perhaps represents the coat of arms of the Proshian family 98 The large high relief covers most of the northern wall above the archways leading to the rock carved family sepulcher of the Proshians The funerary chamber to the northeast of the gavit (narthex) was constructed in 1283 and houses the remains of Khaghbakian Prosh, a vassal of the Zakʿarid dynasty who had sold the monastery to the Prosh family A stairway west of the gavit leads up to a burial chamber of his son Papak and his wife Ruzukan which according to an inscription on one of the central columns was hewn out in 1288 The plastically rendered relief sculptures show a monumental bovine head at the apex holding a large ring in its mouth which is fastened to chains that are attached to the collars of symmetrically doubled confronted lions marchant The long curving tails of the imposing felines evolve at the tips into large upward-looking dragon heads Rendered with gaping snouts terminating in tightly curled tips and revealing large fangs and projecting tongues as well as ornamental bands form

ing collars around the necks, the dragon heads diagonally flank the bovine head from below in a triangular fashion The composition thus offers a parallel to the two relief sculptures with paired dragons framing a bovine head (which in one instance also holds a ring in its mouth) that circumscribe two of the towers of the northern city wall at Ani (fig 130) At Geghard the sculptures are augmented further just below the lions’ frontally oriented heads by the sculpture of a commanding eagle with outspread wings whose claws grasp an ungulate – most probably a symbol of the princes’ power (fig 136) An elaboration of the motif of dragon heads flanking a central mask-like human face is featured on the türbe of Hüdavend Hatun in Niğde The monument, with a sixteen-sided pyramidal roof on an octagonal body, is of cut stone and was built in 712/1312, during the lifetime of the princess who was buried there twenty years later, and during the rule of the Ilkhanid governor Sunqur Ağa The motif is amalgamated with the relief of a frontally presented double-headed bird of prey, almost certainly symbolising an eagle, which fills one of the carved blind niches that decorate the façade of the octagonal building The tips of the outspread wings of the eagle extend into upward-curving dragon heads with long, upwardcurved snouts and projecting tongues A masklike frontally rendered human head springs from between the elongated interlaced birds’ necks that form a loop at the base, while the addorsed eagle heads peck at their own outspread wings (fig 137) As was shown earlier in chapter 5, animals can sometimes be seen merging visually with one another, thus fusing not only bodily but presumably also in terms of their innate characteristics The motif here shows a fusion of the eagle with the dragon, both of which are rendered symmetrically with doubled heads and necks, to which the human aspect is added in the form of the central frontally represented face, resulting in a therianthropomorphic hybrid The eagle heads are thus shown hacking with their sharp beaks at their own wings since these are at the same time an extension of the “bodies” of the dragons that spring from the wing tips Moreover, this composite imagery offers an interesting parallel to that of the mask-like face flanked by dragon heads with wide-open mouths that appears on the
above-mentioned thirteenth-century caravanserai Susuz Han near Bucak (figs 7 and 124) However, at the türbe of Hüdavend Hatun the dragons appear visually merged with a double-headed eagle, the bifid tongues thrust upwards from their gaping jaws towards the eagle’s heads and then towards the human head at the apex It may be presumed that just as in the case of the conceptual doubling of representations mentioned earlier, a device prominent throughout the medieval period and seen here in the double-headed eagle and dragon, the composite hybrid portrayed here on the türbe is similarly an example of an intention to reinforce and augment the visual impact and intended effect of the potent symbol The motif shown on the türbe may thus be seen as a visually amplified version of that on the caravanserai Susuz Han It is further noteworthy that the pictorial amalgamation of the dragon and the bird, as shown in the present example, is also illustrated for instance on the presumably royal Saljuq silk fragment, now preserved in the shrine of Saint Apollinaris in Siegburg (fig 69) The representation of a closely related motif on the türbe of Hüdavend Hatun, the daughter of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān Rukn al-Dīn Qılıch Arslan IV, underlines its royal connotations The examples above moreover show that even during Ilkhanid rule the iconography of the dragon, stylistically and presumably also iconologically, continued to follow “Saljuq-style” conventions A similar conceptualisation governs a later illustration in a copy of Zakariyyāʾ ibn Muḥammad al-Qazwīnī’s cosmography ʿAjāʾib al-makhlūqāt wa gharāʾib al-mawjūdāt (“Wonders of Creation and Oddities of Existence”), written around 668/1270 It is represented in the Sarre Qazwīnī, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, the suggested dates for which have varied from 1350 to the early fifteenth century 99 It is considered “a last living example of the long tradition of manuscript painting associated with the local iconographical tradition of Diyarbakir ”100 In the light of this attribution it may be interesting to take a closer look at what is a comparatively late representation of the motif It shows a gigantic polycephalic scaly dragon (al-tannīn) with a large pretzel-like knot incorporating a small, mask-like human head Two of the six projecting dragon heads, their confronted gaping jaws revealing pro

jecting tongues, encircle and surmount the human head The small head thus appears almost to grow out of the dragon’s body, while being flanked at the same time by four other dragon heads that project from just below (fig 138) It is thus literally engulfed by the dragon heads and seems almost to fuse with the body of the giant polycephalic dragon The text to the illustration states that the dragon was so large that it snapped off the top third of the minaret of Anṭākiya (Antioch) 101 With regard to the paired reliefs at Susuz Han, Öney has identified the human heads as sun rosettes threatened by the “underground forces and the dark moon symbol” of the dragon,102 hence associating it with astrological functions, according to which the dragon is the cause of solar and lunar eclipses It is important to note however, as Abbas Daneshvari has demonstrated, that the concept of the dragon solely in its role as eclipse monster threatening the light of the luminaries and, by extension, the rulers as their worldly embodiments, presents only one aspect of the multivalent symbolism of the dragon 103 As has been shown above there exists at the same time another possibility: that of perceiving the symbolism of the gaping dragons’ jaws flanking a central motif as beneficial and apotropaic At Susuz Han this reading is supported by paired winged figures whose presence seems to bestow a honorific dimension upon the iconography of the gaping dragons’ jaws flanking the mask-like human faces (figs 7 and 124) It thus appears reasonable to assume that the iconographic theme of dragons’ jaws flanking other central motifs, such as inscriptions, vegetation or animal heads may be similarly associated with a beneficial, apotropaic function
The dragon-tamer
The representation, examined above, of the ruler transposed to a cosmic plane flanked on either side by dragons, survived mainly on portable objects (figs 113–116), in particular on silverinlaid metalwork from the greater Khurasan region, from where this visual expression spread westward It is significant in this respect that the
central figure is portrayed with one or both of his arms extended to hold the staffs just below the dragon heads, in other words as if grasping the necks of the dragons The fact that sometimes the figure does not hold the creatures’ necks with both hands may suggest that the actual holding of the necks is not a prerequisite For the imagery to convey its iconological content to the contemporary beholder – namely the ruler as victor over mythical creatures which symbolise any and all hostile forces – it apparently sufficed to represent the key elements of a central figure flanked by two dragons In its most detailed and perhaps most complete execution, this important iconographic expression is emblematised on an architectural structure In a powerful parallel to the widely spread iconography of the ruler flanked by dragons the extraordinary representation of a frontally portrayed figure seated cross-legged is shown grasping the tongues of a pair of mighty confronted dragons The reliefs are carved on a now destroyed section of the Talisman Gate, the Bāb al-Ṭilasm (formerly Bāb al-Ḥalaba), one of the four gates at the east of Baghdad (figs 139a and b) 104 The gate was part of the city wall of Baghdad, the capital of the ʿAbbasid caliphate, and according to the inscription was completed in 618/1221–2 under the caliph Abu ’l-ʿAbbās Aḥmad al-Nāṣir li-Dīn Allāh (577/1181–620/1223) In order to restore moral and political unity and to bring about a revival of the old grandeur of the ʿAbbasid empire,105 the caliph sought to develop and incorporate in the principal Sunnī states fraternities dedicated to the classical Islamic futuwwa (which may be translated as “youthful manliness”), whose aim was to promote a chivalric code of behaviour 106 Portrayed in high relief on the upper part of the spandrels of the arched gateway were two majestic confronted horned dragons whose wide-open snouts with turned-up tips, marked by rows of sharp teeth and fangs, reveal excessively long tongues with bifid ends that are grasped with both outstretched hands by the central frontally-portrayed figure The latter has a “moon-shaped” face flanked by long tresses, which is distinguished by a halo and a three-pronged crown, and sits cross

107 Meinecke, 1989, p 58 108 Friedrich Sarre interprets one of the dragons as symbolising the Khwārazm-shāh ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Takash, who had been overcome by the Mongols in the year before the erection of the monument, and the other as a personification of the Mongols themselves (Sarre and Herzfeld, 1911, vol 1, p 40) Max van Berchem however conceives the second dragon as representing the Ismāʿīlī Grand Master of Alamūt, Jalāl al-Dīn Ḥasan III ibn Muḥammad II who was subordinate to the caliphate since 608/1211–2 Al-Juwaynī, Taʾrīkh-i jahān-gushāy, tr Boyle, 1912–37, vol 2, pp 364, 391, 699–701; van Berchem, “Das Baghdad Talismantor,” ed Sarre and Herzfeld, 1911, vol 1, and idem, 1897, pp 474–7 This second interpretation may
be more likely since al-Nāṣir had succeeded in securing the return of the Syrian and Iranian Ismāʿīlīs to the fold of Sunnī orthodoxy in 608/1211–2 See however Marshall Hodgson (1955, pp 215–25, esp pp 222–3, n 31) who rejects van Berchem’s reading of Ḥasan symbolising the second dragon Cf Hartmann, 1975, pp 164–6; ul-Huda, 2003, pp 13–40, esp p 35 109 See Kuntzmann, 1983, esp 51–116; Anthony, 2007, pp 134–5; Kristiansen and Larsson, 2005, pp 264, 297 110 Gombrich, 1960, pp 87–90 111 Muʿjam al-buldān, III, p 507, cited after Sarre and Herzfeld, 1920, vol 2, p 153 112 Sarre and Herzfeld, 1911, vol 1, pp 38–40 113 The significance of the gate as potent victory
legged just above the apex of the arch He is clad in an ornately patterned loose long coat, belted just below the slightly protruding belly over trousers, with short boots projecting from below the hem The dragons have muscular forelegs depicted with toes and talonesque claws, the inner forelegs being raised Their heads are crowned by a pair of curved horns that project from the top of the head and are flanked by small, cusped ears, folded to the back; the faces are rendered with small, almond-shaped eyes and trefoil-shaped motifs on the face and upper part of the neck, which is demarcated below the jaw line by small, contiguous curls, while larger curls accentuate the back of the neck The enormous dragons’ scaly serpentine tails twine along the arch forming two impressive knots, the first combining a pretzel-shape with an additional loop, the second a straightforward pretzel-like knot, then extend into three more loops and taper to the tip (lacunae attest to the possible existence formerly of small heads whose identity, bird or dragon heads, can no longer be verified) The dragons’ feathery elegantly upswept wings project from the haunches and end in curls, the long uppermost tip curling inward and terminating in small, crested birds’ heads with wattles projecting from the chin and long feathers sweeping down the back of the necks With their small, curved beaks the birds peck at the dragons’ wings The monumental depiction of the cross-legged central haloed and crowned figure (apparently small in size but in fact reaching about 60 cm in height)107 subduing the giant dragons by holding their tongues seems to reflect the ancient concept of the dragon-tamer The fact that the royal figure, who is comparatively small in proportion to the dragons, manages to subjugate the great beasts only adds to the impression of dominance and prestige the presentation intends to convey The gesture of tightly grasping the dragons’ tongues is probably the crucial aspect of the image, rep
resenting not only the control of speech but also the ritual of public subjugation of the dragons and thereby the harnessing of their forces This timehonoured motif of victory doubtless symbolises the caliph’s heroic feat of overcoming adverse forces, embodied by the dragons whose likeness was moreover sometimes used to emblematise personified historical foes 108 The pairing of dragons observed specifically on monumental depictions was presumably intended as much to reinforce and replicate the symbolic meaning as to create an effect of pictorial symmetry This tendency to double single units is a well-known phenomenon among Near Eastern cultures 109 It may thus be presumed that the iconographic elements of this composition have been selected in order to convey a certain meaning or to evoke a certain response in the beholder It is in the consciousness of the latter that the full cultural meaning of the artwork unfolds As Ernst Gombrich has pointed out: “The form of a representation cannot be divorced from its purpose and the requirements of the society in which the given visual language gains currency ”110 In order to provide an insight into the symbolic mindset and linguistic expression of the period during which the imagery of the dragon was commonly used as metaphor and allegory, Ernst Herzfeld refers to the report of the contemporary scholar Yāqūt, who compares the conquest of the fort of Ṭabaraq near Rayy by the Great Saljuq sulṭān Ṭoghrıl III in 588/1192 (previously occupied by the Khwārazm-shāh Takash) to a serpent with two heads, one in Iraq, the other in Khurasan, who opens its mouth because it wants to swallow both 111 This double-headed giant serpent or paired dragon whose bifid tongues are immobilised and are effectively bound by the restraining hands of the central seated figure is imbued with more effective talismanic power than anything else As suggested many years ago by Herzfeld112 and more recently by Meinecke,113 the

monument was still relevant in not too distant memory which is reflected in the symbolic act of the Ottoman sulṭān Murād IV ibn Aḥmad I (1032/1623–1049/1640) who, after his occupation of Baghdad in 1638, walled up the gateway in order to prophylactically curtail the potency of the gate as victory monument, in other words, to preclude any future conquests Meinecke, 1989, p 58 Cf also Sarre and Herzfeld, 1911, vol 1, pp 34–6 114 Cf Hauptmann von Gladiss, ed , 2006, p 115 115 Hartner, 1938, p 144 116 Pancaroğlu, 2001, pp 171–2, n 29 The lion’s asso

monumental sculptures almost certainly represented a victory commemoration on a triumphal gateway, which also served as entrance to the caliphal palace Significantly, by employing the time-honoured symbolism of the dragon-tamer this victory commemoration aimed at invoking supernatural talismanic defences as a psychological safeguard against dangerous forces or catastrophic events The associated royal charisma may moreover be rooted in the celestial,114 and possibly astrological, realms Hartner sees in the central figure “the new-born child – symbol of the new moon ”115 However on account of the confronted seated lions in profile, which are carved in relief onto the imposts below the arch, the central figure could also be interpreted as a personification of the Sun whose house is in Leo 116 However, irrespective of the visual conflation of the figure with either the Sun or the Moon, its striking imagery probably represented the triumph of the “heavenly ruler” over his enemies by employing a highly potent symbolism of great antiquity 117 On yet another level, as has been pointed out by Herzfeld, the popularly used appellation “Talisman Gate” (Bāb al-Ṭilasm) is certainly no mere coincidence but, as noted above, may be associated with the overall propitious and apotropaic content of the iconographic visualisation 118 This is further corroborated by the inscription, which refers to the caliph as “the imām, to whom the whole of humanity has to submit,” as well as “the caliph who is initiated by the master of the world and who is a proof for Allāh of the entirety of beings,” representing a further talismanic aspect alluding to defeated or yet to be defeated rivals of the caliph 119 It has been shown that the emblematic representation of the cosmic ruler flanked by and often grasping dragon-headed staffs, so ubiquitously employed on works of art, in particular on metalwork, from the mid-eleventh to the early thirteenth century, was associated with the ancient concept of the “Master of the Animals,”
represented here as the “Master of the Dragons ” The motif gives visual form to the idea of the cosmic ruler wrestling with and subduing threatening forces, represented by the dragons What is more, the iconographic expression portrays the ruler as dragon-tamer whose supernatural powers enabled him to subdue, contain, tame and transform the dragons rather than annihilate them Since this iconographical theme was used as decoration on a wide range of artefacts accessible to a larger part of society (the Bobrinski bucket, for instance, was perhaps given to a religious dignitary), it seems probable that its semantic meaning was not seen as exclusively confined to the art of the court and the upper classes but rather that it was a multivalent symbol, transcending any specific level of society 120 This was made possible by the fact that the ethos of cosmic rulership was understood to comprise the idea of victory over adverse forces as a synthesis of the fundamental royal virtues and hence itself served as a visual metaphor imbued with a more generalised auspicious and apotropaic significance 121 It is moreover tempting to propose that a bust or a head flanked by two dragons represented an abbreviated reference, which has close analogies to the semantic meaning of the dragon-tamer, and whose allegorical content was clear to a medieval audience The emblematic significance of the allegorical imagery that omitted the visual manifestation of the bodies would have conveyed the same meaning as the examples of the dragon-tamer motif on Khurasani metalwork or the Bāb al-Ṭilasm in Baghdad yet another possibility may be considered, namely that a twofold approach was possible in reading this imagery, and that a literal as well as an allegorical conception was attached to the “abbreviated” form What is more, as already noted above, the representation alludes to a mythical vision of the ruler and refers to the age-old portrayal of the archetypal royal hero overcoming dangerous creatures in a mythical-heroic manner It may be suggested with a degree of certainty that to the

medieval mind the animal combat or the mastery of beasts was associated with the timeless image of a heroic and royal ideal associated with the ruler Representations of the ruler between two dragons, as emblematised in the Bāb al-Ṭilasm relief, show him constraining the great powers of the dragons within the control of his realm, thereby demonstrating his mythical powers It is conceivable that when commissioning the visual metaphor and sculptural vision of the mythical dragon-tamer for the monumental victory commemoration, the caliph al-Nāṣir’s aim was to evoke the supernatural forces associated with the time-honoured Indo-Iranian concept as well as to appropriate the associated royal charisma of ancient kingship
c Symbolism of the dragon’s tongue
It is inherent in the dragon’s very nature that, owing to its multivalent qualities, it escapes definition One of its many preeminent features is the conspicuous emphasis on the tongue, used to denote the supernatural quality of the creature In most of the examples discussed earlier, the deep gaping throats of the fabulous creatures reveal tongues, which are invariably oriented towards the central motif In the Armenian examples at the late ninth-century monastic complex of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Siunikʿ (figs 120–122) and the mid-tenth-century cathedral of the Holy Apostles in Kars (figs 118 and 119), the outstretched ophidian tongues are clearly directed at the ears of the human heads The serpent-headed staffs that flank the seated frontally portrayed figures depicted on twelfth- or thirteenth-century Islamic metalwork are also shown with the tongues projecting from the mouths towards the human heads (figs 113–116) This may be related to the fact that a snake’s tongue is known to dart out before it strikes at a foe At the Bāb al-Ṭilasm in
Baghdad of 618/1221–2 the central figure is hence portrayed as holding tightly on to the dragons’ tongues (figs 139a and b) As has been shown, this gesture is associated with the symbolism of subjugation by bridling the creatures and thereby rendering them defenceless Reference to taming and mastering the (serpent-)dragon by means of holding its tongue is also made in al-Kisāʾī’s story of Moses (Mūsa) and the pharaoh (firʿawn) To save the life of the latter from the attack of the Prophet’s rod turned giant serpent, Moses “cried to the serpent, which came to him as a tame dog comes to his master Moses put his hand in its mouth and caught its tongue, whereupon it was again a staff 122 The vital organ of the tongue thus seems to epitomise the seat or the extension of power of the mythical creature This underscores the inference that the use of control over this potent emblem permits the powerful creature to be overmastered Establishing control over the dragon implies of course not only the domination of its dark and evil nature, but also of its inherent beneficial qualities An attempt will be made in the next and subsequent chapters to describe the nature of these qualities Tongues are generally associated with the power of speech, a quality of the dragon that will be addressed in chapter 13 According to the Qurʾān, the magician-king Sulaymān ibn Dāwūd, the biblical Solomon, was acquainted with the speech of birds and animals (sūra 27, 16–9), a tradition based on I Kings 4 33 123 In Judaism as well as in Islamic scriptural tradition the understanding of the language of animals was initially associated with the story of Paradise 124 The early Haggada speaks of Adam understanding the language of birds and beasts125 and of Eve126 speaking with the serpent127 who was considered to be the wisest, the cleverest and the most astute of all animals 128 In the late Haggada non-Jewish folklore was censored before it was assimilated; the

and of his breath is mentioned in the romance Wīs u Rāmīn (tr and ed Davis, 2008, p 364 and 83, respectively) See also the related metaphorical imagery used by Matthew of Edessa, p 9, n 61 136 References to such phenomena are preserved in Greek tradition The Hellenistic/Roman author Apollodorus relates that Melampus acquired the gift of prophecy after he had performed funeral rites for some serpents which had been killed by his servants and thence reared the young serpents (Bibliotheca I 9 11–2, p 87; Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica I 118 Cf Eustathius on Homer, Odyssey XI 292, p 1685; Pliny, Naturalis Historia, X 137 See also Frazer, 1888, p 166) When these were fully grown, they crept onto each of his shoulders as he slept and cleansed his ears with their tongues When he woke up he understood the voices of the birds and other animals, and thus acquired the gift of foretelling the future Cassandra and her brother Helenus are said to have acquired their prophetic gift in the same manner When young they were placed one night in the temple of Apollo and in the morning were found with serpents wreathed around their bodies, licking their ears (cf Scholiast on Homer, Iliad, VII 44; Tzetzes, Scholiast in Lycophron, Introd. I, pp 266–8, ed Müller, C G ; Scholiast on Euripides, Hecuba, V 86) Likewise Porphyrios is recorded as saying that perhaps all men might understand the language of all the animals if a serpent had washed their ears (De Abstinentia, III 4)
137 “The reason why the serpent has the capacity to understand the language of the birds and the animals is according to Pliny (after a saying of Democritus) that they are generated from the mixed blood of diverse birds, hence anyone who eats a serpent will understand the bird language” (Naturalis Historia, X 70; see also XXIX 22), as cited in Frazer, 1888, p 180 138 Cicero, De divinatione 1 92 and 94 Cf Appian’s account of his successful escape from the Jewish revolt in Egypt (c 116 ad) near Pelusium thanks to an Arab guide who correctly interpreted the three screeches of a crow Appian, Roman History 24,19
biblical king Solomon took the place of the great serpent(s) and could understand and speak the language of animals as well as teach their language to others 129 However, in spite of this assimilation the connection of the serpent with the language of animals remained widespread in folktales throughout Asia and the Near East 130 One of the oldest recorded versions is a third-century Buddhist tale, in which a king rescues the daughter of a dragon-king who thereupon grants him a wish The king says that he has already many precious objects but that he wishes to understand the language of the animals The dragon-king grants him this request on condition that he will keep his ability a secret 131 In Armenian folktales serpents can speak and the touching of a serpent’s tongue serves as a source of knowledge 132 Vestiges of such myths may be discerned in Armenian popular traditions, which similarly record that a grateful serpent king gave the knowledge to cure all diseases to a boy who had saved his son He transmitted this
knowledge by touching the boy’s tongue with his own; the boy then became the physician known also in the Turkish-speaking world as Luqmān al-ḥakīm 133 In another Armenian story, the grateful serpent-prince licks a dead person back to life 134 According to a further tradition the grateful serpent passes on the ability to understand the language of all animals through the power of its breath 135 Similarly in antiquity the ability to confer supernatural knowledge of the language of animals, that is to say, the art of divination, on human beings was most commonly attributed to the serpent 136 These scattered references to human mastery of the language of the animals functioned as metaphors for the extraordinary lucidity of prophets, saints and sages Other widespread views held that the eating of serpent’s flesh transmitted supernatural wisdom to the consumer,137 and that knowledge of the language of animals was given to Arabs 138 This mantic art they are supposed to have acquired by

139 See Flavius Philostratus, who at the beginning of the third century ad, wrote a biography of the wandering philosopher Apollonius of Tyana in Cappadocia (Vita Apollonii 1 20, 2 vols , tr Conybeare, F C , London, 1980, p 57; also 3 9, p 249), who became master of the beasts by acquiring an understanding of the language and ideas of animals from the Arab tribes “by feeding either on the heart or the liver of the dragon” The mantic significance attributed in antiquity to (serpent-)dragons in revelations and oracles can still be gleaned from the writings of the fifth-century Greek poet Nonnos (Dionysiaca XLI 340–1) when he reports that ophion has recorded the sayings of the gods about the world (thesphata kosmou) The second-century Greek traveller and geographer Pausanias (Graeciae Descriptio IV 10 5–6) even called a seer outright Ophioneus It may not be irrelevant to note that in the Scandinavian version of the epic of Siegfried, the hero roasted the dragon’s heart, whereby some dragon blood dropped onto his tongue, which led to his acquisition of an understanding of the bird language; see Schirmunski, 1961, p 55 140 535th Night [1830 Calcutta ed count] The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, tr Burton, 1885, vol 5, pp 407–9 Cf Marzolph and van Leeuwen, 2004, pp 349

eating the heart or the liver of large serpents 139 The lasting popularity of this type of account is evidenced in its appearance in the frame tale of the Alf layla wa-layla in the story of the Queen of the Serpents Here the queen consents to be slain and sacrifices her flesh, which when boiled and eaten has healing properties 140 Moreover, the drinking of the elixir is said to give access to the fountains of knowledge, in other words knowledge of all sciences Another story, the
Keys of Destiny, tells of a place that harbours the secret of transforming base metal into gold and ultimately of gaining immortality Access to it can only be gained by killing a serpent in a black valley and preparing an ointment from the reptile’s heart mixed with other ingredients 141 In folk tales the imbibing, ingesting or application by any means of elixirs prepared from the heart or the flesh of a serpent initiates into hidden secrets 142

ancient Khwārazmian astronomy and astrology that the Khwārazmians “knew them [the constellations] better than the [pre-Islamic] Arabs ”5 Later Parthian (250 bc–224 ad) and Sasanian (224–652 ad) kings are recorded as having maintained a “chief of the star-gazers” (axtarmārānsālār) at court where a regnal horoscope would be drawn up for each king However, only during the reign of the Sasanian king Shāpūr I (r 241–271) was the study of Iranian astronomy and astrology known to have been encouraged According to the Dēnkard (Book IV), the ninthcentury compendium of the Zoroastrian religion, the king is said to have gathered the astrological writings, “which were dispersed throughout India, the Byzantine empire and other lands ”6 Another Sasanian ruler who, according to al-Bīrūnī, encouraged Greek or Graeco-Syrian and Indian scholars in Iran was Khusraw I Anūshirwān (r 531–579) 7 According to a tradition reported by Firdawsī, the colossal throne (taq-i taqdis) of his grandson, the last Sasanian king Khusraw II Parwīz (r 591–628), was embellished with images of the seven regions as well as the seven planets and the twelve signs of the zodiac 8 As the centre of the astrological throne the ruler represented the one who held the power to influence the stars 9 Political crises were regarded as inevitable at acute aspects of the constellations 10
a Astrology in medieval Central Asia
The ancient practice of astrology,1 the interpretation of the movement of celestial bodies as reflecting divine powers and enabling prognostication of the future, had a deep and pervasive influence on early and medieval Islamic thought and culture 2 The history of astrology, which had been introduced into the Iranised world of Central Asia through Graeco-Babylonian influence, goes back to ancient times Moreover, with the spread of Buddhism into Central Asia, Iran and China, Indian nakṣatra (lunar asterism) astrology was introduced 3 Interest in the science of astronomy, closely and in practice inextricably linked with astrology, is further corroborated in Central Asia by findings during excavations at the religious and funerary complex of Qoy-Qrylgan-Qalʿa (fourth/ third century bc to the third/fourth century ad) in the region of Toʿrtkoʿl in Khwārazm, which might indicate that the site could have been used for astronomical observations The findings include clay fragments and rings that could be reconstructed to form an astrolabe with a circular alidade 4 The great tenth-century Khwārazmian scholar Abu ’l-Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Bīrūnī, known as “the Master” (al-ustādh), who devoted more than half of his extensive writings to astronomy and astrology, writes in relation to

scholars,16 who in turn maintained contact with their Indian counterparts 17 In fact both sciences, astronomy (ʿilm al-hayʾa, the “science of the figure (of the heavens)” or ʿilm al-falak, “science of the spheres”) and astrology (ʿilm al-nujūm, the “science of the stars”), were for a long time so close that the word munajjim was used to designate both astrologer and astronomer 18 This is based on the fact that, according to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (known to the Latins as Geber),19 one of the main representatives of earlier Arabic alchemy, “the astrologer must be a mathematician; he must have mastery of astronomy, this is a part of ʿilm al-nujūm (the “science of the stars” or astrology) For ʿilm al-hayʾa (astronomy) is the description of the situation of the state of the sky and what it contains (ṣūrat waḍʿ al-falak wa-mā fīhi), whereas astrology is the gift of the stars (ʿaṭāʾ al-kawākib) 20 Astrology, which involves calculating the position of the planets and the mathematical production of horoscopes, is often referred to as judicial (or catarchic) astrology (ʿilm aḥkām al-hayʾa, the “science of the judgment of the stars”) 21 Astrological predictions consisted not only of determining the fate of an individual (mawālīd, “genethlialogy,” or horoscopic astrology) and of the auspicious and inauspicious timing of events and actions (ikhtiyārāt, “choices”), but also of the application of continuous horoscopes for determining the course of events for a country or dynasty or to answer specific questions (masāʾil, “interrogations”) 22 In spite of the fact that astrology stood in fundamental opposition to the tenets of the Islamic religion,23 it gradually established a role in the public life of Islamic rulers 24 Well-known astrologers included, for instance, Māshāʾallāh ibn Atharī, an Iranian Jew from Basra, and Abū Sahl al-Faḍl ibn Nawbakht, an Iranian, who converted from Zoroastrianism to Islam at the court of the second ʿAbbasid caliph Abū Jaʿfar al-Manṣūr (r 136/754–158/775) Both
Sanskrit astrological texts were translated into Pahlawī in the Central Asian world, according to David Pingree, in particular in Sind and Afghanistan 11 During the last centuries of Sasanian rule the influence of the sciences of astronomy and astrology, which were often a synthesis of Hellenistic and Indian theories, was particularly prevalent The works of many early Islamic astrologers, many of whom were Iranians or Central Asians, in turn incorporated numerous Indian astronomical and astrological theories This is reflected in the works of the ninth-century astrologer Abū Maʿshar Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿUmar (d 272/886) from Balkh who combines in his Zīj al-hazārāt (“The Zij of the Thousands”) Hindu, Sasanian and Hellenistic astronomical and astrological traditions, claiming to have used an ancient Persian text from antediluvian times written during the reign of Ṭahmūrath (Av Takhma Urupi), the second king of the Pīshdādian dynasty of legendary epic Iranian history 12 Ibn al-Nadīm quotes passages from Abū Maʿshar’s Kitāb ikhtilāf al-zījāt (“The Book on the Variations among zījs”), which contain calculations determining the movement of the planets:
The people of the time of Ṭahmūrath and the more ancient Persians called these the “cycles of the thousands”; and the wise men of India and their kings, the ancient kings of Persia, and the ancient Chaldeans who lived in Babylon determined the mean longitudes of the seven planets by means of them, preferring them over others because of their accuracy and brevity 13
The translation movement of the early ʿAbbasid period saw an unprecedented level of activity in the sciences of astronomy and astrology This had a profound effect on social attitudes 14 Indeed astronomy was viewed by scholars as the “mistress of all sciences ”15 The strong astrological tradition in the Sasanian period helps to explain why the field of Arabic astrological literature in the early Islamic period was dominated by Iranian

period immediately preceding Islam The major assemblies of the Sogdians (anvāzak), whose responsibilities included proclaiming the new king, were composed not only of local rulers and ecclesiastical dignitaries but also of astrologers and soothsayers 29 During their campaigns, the Turkic Ghaznawid sulṭāns, Maḥmūd and Masʿūd were accompanied by their astrologers 30 At the battle of Dandānaqān in 431/1040, the victorious Saljuqs had an astrologer (munajjim) with them, who was rewarded, presumably on account of his correct prognostications, when Ṭoghrıl proclaimed himself ruler of Khurasan 31 Soothsaying qualities are also attested for members of the ruling house, for according to Ibn al-Athīr, even Ṭoghrıl’s cousin, Qutulmish ibn Arslan Isrāʾīl, had astrological skills 32 Astrologers from greater Khurasan are known to have moved to the courts of the Rūm Saljuqs of Anatolia Among them was the mother of the thirteenth-century chronicler Ibn Bībī, known as al-Bībī al-Munajjima (“the lady, the astrologer”), who was from Nīshāpūr and working as astrologer at the court of the Khwārazm-shāh Jalāl al-Dīn There she met an ambassador of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Kay Qubādh I of Konya The meeting made such an impression on the ambassador that he informed the Saljuq sulṭān and in due course the family was invited to the court in Konya where she successfully predicted a military victory 33 The services of the astrologer would frequently be requested before the undertaking of any important action The astrologer Shams al-Dīn, for instance, is said to have determined the time of the military offensive under the Ayyubid al-Kāmil Nāṣir al-Dīn (r 615/1218–635/1238) 34 Like their eastern cousins, the Great Saljuqs, some Rūm Saljuq rulers, such as Malik ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Dāwud Shāh, also practised the science of astrology themselves 35 Hence throughout medieval Islamic history the science remained popular, astrological practices being patronised not only by members of princely circles but by most segments of Islamic society 36
astrologers were leading astrological advisors to this caliph and instrumental in drawing up a horoscope for him determining the day (4 Rabīʿ al-Thānī 145/30 July 762) on which the construction of the city of Baghdad should begin The Iranophile ʿAbdallāh al-Maʾmūn (r 198/813–218/833) was the son of Hārūn al-Rashīd by an Iranian slave girl and after his father’s death in 193/809 ruled over the eastern half of the caliphate residing in Khurasan After overthrowing his brother al-Amīn, who ruled over the western half, in a civil war, al-Maʾmūn became caliph in Marw in 198/813 and ruled the caliphate from that city for another five years, during which time he gathered around him astronomers from Ferghana, Chach, Khwārazm and greater Khurasan 25 In his celebrated historical work al-Masʿūdī reports that under the influence of his Iranian vizier al-Faḍl ibn Sahl Zadhānfarūkh (d 202/818), al-Maʾmūn:
used to spend time investigating astrological rulings and prognostications, following what the stars prescribed, and modeling his conduct on that of the past Sāsānian emperors like Ardashīr ibn Bābak [Ardashīr Pāpakān I, r 224–41] and others 26
When he moved to Baghdad in 204/819, he was followed by a host of astronomers and astrologers 27 The pervasive role that astrology played may be seen in the example of the vizier Ibn Muqla (d 328/940) who, upon the advice of the astrologers, arranged his meeting with the caliph al-Rāḍī (322/934–329/940) when the Moon was in the zodiac sign Leo governed by the Sun, considered the most auspicious time to meet for secretive affairs The science of the celestial bodies was thus of such significance for Islamic rulers that most of their decisions were governed by astrological considerations 28 This predisposition was equally prevalent among rulers of Turkic stock and is also attested for the Sogdians (who were closely associated with the Turkic empires and played the role of active agents of cultural interaction) in the

The idea that these phenomena were caused by a body whose head and tail intercept the Sun’s and the Moon’s light was probably related to the emergence of definite ideas as to the nature of the orbits of the Sun and the Moon and their opposite points of intersection between the Moon’s orbit and the ecliptic 41 The classical theory of the dragon myth seems to have been modified in accordance with developments in astrological doctrine at least from late Arsacid and Sasanian times onwards 42 Sasanian astrologers received from India the notion of Rāhu, a celestial serpent whose head (siras) and tail (ketu) cause solar and lunar eclipses 43 In Pahlawī Rāhu was referred to as Gōchihr, his head sar, and his tail dumb; in Arabic, the latter were respectively called raʾs and dhanab 44 The great treatise on horoscopic astrology of the first-century Hellenistic astrologer Dorotheus of Sidon, which was first translated into Persian in the third century and into Arabic in the eighth century, contains a chapter (V, 43) entitled “on clarifying the phases of the moon and the head of the dragon and its tail ” It states that “the head is called the “ascending” and its tail the “descending” and the signs which those learned in the stars call “obscured” are from Leo to Capricorn ...”45 Astrology also offered support for Zoroastrian apocalyptic ideas, according to which the planetary bodies were regarded as evil; the

The idea that eclipses of the Sun and the Moon were caused by the interference of an eclipse monster was widely held throughout the Eurasian continent and can be traced back to remote antiquity 37 The fearful monster, which quenched the light of the supreme luminaries by seizing them in its jaws, was generally conceived as a giant serpent or dragon, an iconography thought to be of oriental origin 38 Its function was thus seen to be that of threatening and “devouring,” as well as “delivering” and protecting the great luminaries at certain irregular intervals 39 A number of theories arose to explain the dragon’s role in the phenomena of solar and lunar eclipses and lunar waxing and waning KhāleqīMoṭlaq offers the following summary:
a dragon comes up from hell every month on the eastern side of the sky and swallows a piece of the moon’s disc every night until the night comes when no part of the moon can be seen Then the moon-god kills the dragon from inside its belly and triumphantly re-emerges In later times, however, the sun took over the moon’s role in the celestial combats, and it was the sun which slew the dragon and rescued the moon from the dragon’s belly twelve times every year 40

the head and tail of the dragon 55 According to Manichaean cosmogony the two dragons were hung up and fettered in the lowest heaven and two angels, male and female, were placed there to cause them to revolve continuously 56 In the history of ancient Indian astronomy throughout the pre-Siddhāntic period, only Rāhu (the grahaṇa, “seizer”) was held “responsible” for causing eclipses by devouring the Sun and Moon Ketu (the tail of the dragon), understood as a planet57 that generates comets with its fiery tail, is first mentioned in the Atharvaveda (19 9 8-10) 58 Both Rāhu and Ketu appear in the great epic Mahābhārata (1 5 15–7), in which the demon Rāhu allied himself with the celestial gods in the struggle against the world serpent, Ananta After the victorious event, he assumed a disguise and thus succeeded in drinking from the most beneficial of substances, the amṛta (lit “non-dying”; Av haoma, Vedic Skt sóma)59 drink containing the miraculous herb of immortality But the Sun and the Moon having detected his deception denounced him to the gods, whereupon Vishnu swiftly threw his discus (sudarśanacakra) and severed Rāhu’s head However, the drink had already produced its effect so that his head and tail both survive, immortalised, as invisible planets and intransigent enemies of the luminaries As a consequence, the Sun and the Moon are periodically – in symbolic terms “swallowed” or “disappear in” the vengeful monster that thus causes solar and lunar eclipses 60 In the later, “scientific” phase, when Indian notions were transmitted to Western Asia and the wider Iranian world, the two parts of the
“good” luminaries, the Sun and the Moon, were removed from the category of the seven planets whose intrusion brought injustice into the world 46 Consequently the Sun and the Moon were substituted by two “demonic” opponents, the head and tail of the dragon (Pahl gōchihr which stems from the Avestan gao chithra, “holding the seed of cattle,” formerly the stock epithet of the Moon47) 48 According to the Bundahishn, Gōchihr is portrayed as “similar to a snake with the head in Gemini (dō-pahikar) and the tail in Centaurus (nēmasp), so that at all times there are six constellations between its head and tail ”49 In contradistinction to the original meaning of gao chithra, the light and fecundity attribute of the Moon, the dragon’s head (gōchihr sar) and tail (gōchihr dumb) came to represent the demon of eclipses that intercepts the light of the luminaries, the personified dark principle and direct antagonist of the luminaries 50 This led to the concept of a polarity of good and evil throughout the cosmos, the eclipse demon being referred to as Dark Sun and Dark Moon, “dark” meaning “obscured,” and “eclipsed ”51 Thus, according to the Bundahishn, the serpent-like (mār homānāg) Gōchihr and Mūsh Parīg, with tail (dumbōmand) and wings (parrwar), are said to be the evil opponents of the stellar constellations and are therefore bound to the Sun’s path to restrain their capacity to cause harm 52 The expulsion of evil from the sky is manifested by the plunging to earth of Gōchihr,53 who sets the earth on fire and whose permanent body will only be destroyed by resurrection 54 The eclipse dragon also played a part in Manichaeism as Anabibazon and Katabibazon,

Candimā-sutta, “Discourse on the Moon”) the Buddha reprimands Rāhu and directs him to release the Moon at once which Rāhu does, knowing that otherwise his head will be split into seven pieces 69 The Buddha thus delivers the Moon (the god dwelling in the Moon), who had appealed to him for refuge, from Rāhu’s clutches 70 The contextual and conceptual metamorphoses of the motif thus attest to a mechanism of continuity of these essential thought systems which governed the Central Asian world and beyond yet even when the scientific causes were clear, the mythological interpretation of the phenomenon survives This fact and the ensuing syncretism is expounded by Hartner:
We might suppose that clear insight into the physical causes of eclipses could have thrown mythological tradition into the background But this has not been the case What we observe is that mythological and astronomical elements contract an intimate fusion The nodes of the moon’s orbit are simply identified with the eclipse monster itself: with the Hindus, Rāhu becomes the ascending, Ketu the descending node; with Persians and Arabs, the head and tail of the Djawzahr play the same role 71
In Islamic astronomy the Persian gōchihr, called al-jawzahar or al-tinnīn (also azhdahā, “the giant dragon”), was sometimes represented as a bipartite or double-headed dragon It is the circumpolar constellation Draco, “represented as a very long serpent with many convolutions; it is coiled around the north pole of the ecliptic,”72 which is sometimes metaphorically applied to the Milky Way 73 The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṅa (III 67) describes how the first sacred waist band or girdle (ayyaṅga which is closely related to the Iranian aiwiyaonghen that is worn by every devout Zoroastrian) was presented to the sun god
eclipse monster were identified with the lunar nodes, which play a crucial role in the eclipses 61 At the beginning of celestial motion the head or forepart, Rāhu, that is to say the ascending node of the Moon’s orbit upon the ecliptic, was in Gemini and Ketu, the tail or hindpart of the bisected serpent-monster, in other words the descending node, was in Sagittarius (al-qaws, lit “bow”), often represented as an armed centaur 62 The 180° extent of the dragon reflects the fact that the nodes occupy diametrically opposite points of the ecliptic Hence the dragon’s body is conceived as arched across the sky 63 The demon of the eclipses Rāhu is well-known not only in the Brahmanic tradition, but also in Buddhism 64 In the Buddhist Jātaka stories of the previous births of Gautama Buddha, which were familiar throughout the Central Asian region, repeated reference is made to the Moon gripped between Rāhu’s jaws, or being liberated from the latter 65 Thus, in the Gandhāra Jātaka, the king of Gandhāra chose to become an ascetic after observing a lunar eclipse, explaining that:
Taking the moon’s orb seized by Rāhu as my theme I forsook my great kingdom and took the religious life
because:
There is the moon’s pure orb become dark by trouble from outside; now this kingdom is a trouble to me: I will take the religious life so that the kingdom does not make me dark as Rāhu does the moon’s orb 66
In the Buddhacarita Siddhārtha’s son is called Rāhula “with the face of Rāhu’s adversary ”67 It is of note that in some Pali texts the demon Rāhu is said not to devour the Sun and the Moon, “but merely to caress them with his hand ”68 In the well-known story of the Candrasūtra (Pali

the period of the Prophet Muḥammad’s residence in Medina 80 On this occasion the Prophet is reported to have said “that he had never been so greatly filled with fear,” and the commentaries add to this, “that he thought that the Hour had come, and to illustrate it he is reported to have said that he saw Paradise and Hell so close to him that he could have gathered a bunch of grapes from the land of the blessed, had he stretched out his hand ”81 According to Abū Saʿīd al-Sijzī’s comprehensive tenth-century astrological compilation on the “Conjunctions and Revolutions of the years of the World” which was based on earlier sources, a solar eclipse indeed indicated the death of Muḥammad as well as the accession of the first caliph Abū Bakr 82 The significance accorded to the eclipse is reflected in the bi-partite “dragon” that was seen as temporarily “devouring” the Sun and the Moon at certain irregular intervals, and then disgorging or “delivering,” them – since the two planets always appear to emerge unscathed from their temporary eclipse by the “dragon ” This nonPtolemaic concept played a prominent role in astrological associations whereby the two nodes were treated as though they were real celestial bodies, in other words extra, albeit invisible, “planets,” or fictitious nodes 83 They were conceived as an eighth and a ninth planet, the only difference between them and the original seven planets being that contrary to the others their movement was westwards or “retrograde,” rather than eastwards 84 Ghaznawid and Ghurid military campaigns in India brought not only extensive booty, but resulted at the same time in an influx of scholars, craftsmen and a variety of artisans, all of whom came with their own indigenous iconographies, contributing perhaps to the diffusion of the iconography of al-jawzahar The great scholar Abū Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Bīrūnī had accompanied sulṭān Maḥmūd, possibly as official astrologer, on several of his military expedi
by the king of serpents, Vāsuki, and represented the starry band of the Milky Way 74 In a verse of the late eleventh-century Iranian poet Labībī the seven heads of the dragon represent the heavenly spheres and the universe 75 Together with the acculturation of astronomical knowledge, astrological iconography emerged in the form of visual conceptualisations that were regularly featured in medieval imagery These were emblematically transferred onto architectural sculpture as well as portable objects, in particular metalwork and ceramics Astrological considerations also had a profound bearing on the artistic conventions of the iconography of the dragon Its representation in medieval Islamic astrology has been addressed in a number of studies, foremost among which remains Hartner’s, in which he demonstrates the influence of the conceptualisation of the two “lunar nodes” (al-ʿuqdatāni) on Islamic artisans 76 As seen in sources that pre-date the Islamic period, the crucial aspect of al-jawzahar is that it consists of two nodes of the Moon’s orbit or “points at which (the) two [great] circles of the sphere intersect,”77 in other words the two points where the course of the Moon crosses the plane of the ecliptic from south to north: the “head of the dragon” (raʾs al-tinnīn) is formed by the ascending node of the Moon’s orbit, and, correspondingly, the “tail of the dragon” (dhanab al-tinnīn) by the descending node 78 This associates it with both solar and lunar eclipses; the latter were attributed to the occurrence of a conjunction, or opposition, of the Sun and Moon (New Moon or Full Moon, respectively) in or near the lunar nodes In medieval Islam especially, the astrological influence of the eclipse of the Sun is considered one of the foremost signs of the impending destruction of the world 79 In the Qurʾān the latter is repeatedly described among the signs of perturbations of heavenly bodies (sūra 75, 8–9; and 81, 1) Early Islamic tradition frequently describes the occurrence of an eclipse of the Sun during

85 Boilot, “al-Bīrūnī (Bērūnī), Abu ’l Rayḥān Muḥammad b Aḥmad,” EI2 I, 1136a 86 Tr and ed Wright, 1934, pp 91–2 87 Idem, pp 255, 258 88 Hartner (1938, p 133 and n 30) refers to De magnis coniunctionibus, the Latin version translated by Johannes Hispalensis, printed at Augsburg in 1489 (repr Venice, 1515), which contains a chapter dealing with the planetary influence of the nodes as a figure of the “dragon” with its head and tail twisted around two nodes (reproduced in idem, fig 10) Cf al-Bīrūnī’s references in his Kitāb al-Tafhīm, tr and ed Wright, 1934, p 358 89 Ketu’s serpent tail is alluded to in the Agnipurāṇa; see De Mallmann, 1962, p 86 90 The earliest western Indian representation is found on a fragmentary lintel from Alwar district in Rajasthan, which
figure is shown to hold either a pair of upright dragons, their bodies forming a loop,92 or vertical staffs (figs 113–116); both the coiling bodies and the allegorical staffs end in confronted dragon heads with gaping snouts It is significant that representations of the planet jawzahar thereby make use of the emblematic portrayal of the cosmic ruler mentioned earlier, framed by dragon-headed staffs, ubiquitously employed on visual art from the mid-eleventh to early thirteenth century and associated with the ancient concept of the “Master of the Dragons ” The choice of this cosmic symbolism underlines the prominence accorded to jawzahar which gives an indication of the magnitude of the potential effects the planet could have on the course of human events The conception of the central figure as dragon-tamer thereby perhaps reflects the apparent necessity to harness the forces of this planet The planetary character of the two nodes of al-jawzahar indicates that they are traversing the plane of the ecliptic With respect to the signs, the planets have a “domicilium” as well as a place of exaltation (sharaf) and dejection (hubūṭ) These astronomical terms respectively define the points most distant from and closest to the earth, especially in reference to the elliptical orbit of the Moon In astrology they relate to the point of maximum and minimum influence of one of the seven traditional planets and of the two nodes of al-jawzahar when they find themselves in association with one of the constellations visualised as one of the twelve signs of the zodiac In the Irano-Turkish territories, the eclipse pseudo-planet (al-jawzahar) is often shown at the point of exaltation of its head or tail in Gemini, as for instance on a silver- and copper-inlaid brass ewer from Herat, formerly in the Nuhad
tions to northwest India 85 In his Kitāb al-Tafhīm li-awāʾil ṣināʿat al-tanjīm (“Book of Instruction in the Elements of the Art of Astrology”), written upon his return to Ghazna in 422/1031, he refers to the two fictitious nodes, the eighth and a ninth planet, as knot (ʿuqda) and point of crossing (majāz) 86 In spite of his statement that “they are not real planets,” the same author does however record the position of the raʾs al-tinnīn and the dhanab al-tinnīn in the various astrological tables included in his texts 87 Much earlier, in the work On The Great Conjunctions, or the Aḥkām Taḥāwīl Sinī al-Mawālid, the astrologer Abū Maʿshar (d 272/886) had already referred to the points of exaltation for the nodes of the Moon which for the dragon’s head is in Gemini 3°, and for the tail in Sagittarius 3° 88 The “node of the Moon’s orbit” however is an integral part of the iconography of the eclipse monster, portrayed as loop or twisted knot, sometimes visualised as a pretzel- or heart-shaped knot This is reflected in the symbolism of the personification of comets, Ketu, visualised on the navagraha reliefs that represent the nine Indian planetary deities, which are similarly illustrated with a human torso and a serpentine tail terminating in a knot 89 The earliest surviving representation of Rāhu and Ketu in India is carved on a navagraha lintel from Uttar Pradesh, dating from c 600 or slightly later, in which Ketu is represented as a half-ophidian figure sitting on his coiled serpentine tail beside the cephalic Rāhu (fig 140) 90 Individual depictions of jawzahar – Draco as eighth planet next to the seven traditional planets, comprising the Sun, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury,91 often portray a crosslegged figure holding a dragon in each hand The

inhabited with monster heads with long floppy ears growing from scrolling tendrils (as shown for example in the depiction of “Moon in Cancer”) that Hartner identifies with “the dragon progeny threatening the luminaries or, vicariously, their domicilia and exaltations ”96 However, he has qualified the astrological interpretation suggesting that “in all probability, various elements – astronomical, astrological and mythological – were here fused in one ”97 This shows that the astrological veracity of such details was less important than their exemplary significance It is moreover noteworthy that the monster heads with long floppy ears issue from vegetation, which for its association with fertility generally has positive connotations It may therefore be hypothesised that the depiction of “dragon progeny” together with the signs of the zodiac and the planets was intended to have a beneficial influence on the paths of the luminaries A related large silver-inlaid brass ewer, housed in the Georgian State Museum, Tbilisi, Georgia, which is decorated on the shoulder with the signs of the zodiac and the planets, bears inscriptions that not only give the name of the maker, one Maḥmūd ibn Muḥammad al-Harawī and the date, the month of Shaʿban 577/19 December 1181–17 January 1182, but also state that the “seven heavenly bodies, however proud they may be, are protection for the one who works so ”98 As James Allan states, “from this poem it is evident that the inlayer saw those images as protection for himself against evil ”99 It further underlines the overall magical and prophylactic quality that was ascribed to the iconography of the signs of the zodiac and the planets The frequency of their
Es-Said Collection, now in the National Museum of Qatar in Doha (fig 141) 93 In Islamic tradition, the planetary eclipse in Sagittarius is generally rendered as a centaur taking aim with a bow at its long dragon-headed tail and shooting an arrow into the dragon’s mouth On the Qatar ewer the sign is accordingly portrayed as the protome of a winged quadruped dragon with tongue protruding from the gaping mouth rising from the looped tail (fig 142) A sculptural example of the planetary eclipse in Sagittarius is depicted among eight astrological reliefs carved onto the pillars of the Tigris bridge, near the city of Jazīrat ibn ʿUmar (present-day Cizre), Anatolia Among the reliefs is the upright knotted protome of a dragon with gaping mouth and curled-up snout tip, oriented towards the figure of a centaur shooting with a bow and arrow into its mouth The bridge was commissioned by the wazīr of Mosul, Jamāl al-Dīn Muḥammad al-Iṣfahānī The wazīr’s imprisonment in 558/1163 provides a terminus ante quem for the construction of the bridge and its astrological relief sculptures 94 As pointed out by Hartner, the reliefs are one of the earliestknown sculptural examples “in which the Islamic artist obviously grants the same rights to one or both of these pseudo-planets as to the seven real ones, while in India this had been the rule centuries before ”95 Similarly, depictions of al-jawzahar threatening the Sun and the Moon, or their respective zodiacal animals, the lion and the crab, became prevalent in the decorative programmes of objects, as evidenced in the depictions on the same ewer (figs 143 and 144) The importance of the eclipse pseudo-planet is such that most of the roundels on this ewer show the signs of the zodiac and planets

the dragon that gives the sun also takes it back by its poison 111
depiction, in particular on portable items, moreover emphasises the prodigious cultural significance of the signs of the zodiac and the planets in the medieval Islamic world The prominent depiction of al-jawzahar on objects such as these Herati ewers “evidently originates,” as Hartner has underlined, “not in a doctrinal astrological conception, but in a purely metaphysical, one,” being associated with “the antagonism between the celestial luminaries and the terrestrial lightdevouring dragon ”100 As mentioned, a solar or lunar eclipse (al-kusūf) can occur only when the Moon is at one of the points of crossing (majāz), or nodes In his Kitāb al-Tafhīm al-Bīrūnī, moreover, notes that the latter are perceived as having separate natures, the head being hot, auspicious, and indicating increase of wealth etc and the tail being cold, bringing misfortune, and indicating diminution of wealth, etc 101 In addition he records the information that “some people say that the dragon’s head is male and diurnal and the tail female and nocturnal ”102 From about the twelfth-century symbolic personifications of Sol and Luna, often shown together with the dragon motif, were widely applied to portable objects, especially on metalwork, from greater Khurasan to the Anatolian region By virtue of its very characteristic as an eclipse dragon al-jawzahar was directly linked to the Sun and the Moon The two luminaries are among the representations of the eight planets (the pseudo-planet jawzahar is here represented as eighth “planet”) on the lid of a covered copper alloy bowl, known as Vaso Vescovali, made in the Khurasan region in about 1200 103 A threefaced Sun, akin to the one featured on the Qatar ewer (fig 143), surmounts a winged figure who, seated on a pointed support and holding up the luminary’s “dais,” is symmetrically flanked by two confronted attendants behind whom long-eared jawzahar-like heads grow out of stems which curl behind their waists (fig 145) The Moon consists of a human figure holding up with its four arms (an image probably informed by Indian proto

break the resistance of the priestess and when she is brought in front of Iskandar, Balīnūs declares “this black dragon is the moon [a moon-faced beauty]” a pun that implicitly also refers to the dragon’s association with light and, by inference, perhaps his implicit role as the deliverer and protector of light 116 The esoteric conceptualisation of the dragon is illuminated in the allegory of a hero’s spiritual journey in A Tale of Occidental Exile written by the mystic Shihāb al-Dīn yaḥyā Suhravardī (d 587/1191):
If you desire to be delivered along with your brother [i e , speculative reason, the guide (ʿāṣim)], do not put off traveling Cling to your rope, which is the dragon’s tail (jawzahr) of the holy sphere that dominates the regions of the lunar eclipse [the realms of the eclipse denoting the world of ascetic practice] 117
The hero passes beyond the material world and reaches a light, the active intellect, which is the governor of this world He places the light in the mouth of the dragon, the world of the elements, that “dwelt in the tower of the water-wheel [i e , the sky which turns like a wheel], beneath which was the Sea of Clysma [i e , the water below the sky] and above which are the stars the origin of whose rays was known only to the Creator and those “who are well-grounded in knowledge ”” 118 The metaphysical aspect of the bi-partite dragon is further evoked in a passage of the fables and anecdotes of the early thirteenth-century Marzubān-nāma with the allegorical allusion, “at dawn, when the black snake of night cast the sun’s disc out of the mouth of the east,”119 hence once again implying a double-headed dragon delivering the luminary and the creation of light The luminary aspect of the dragon is also reflected, as Abbas Daneshvari has pointed out, by its flanking the mount of finger rings (fig 30) 120 In Farīd al-Dīn Aṭṭār’s Ilāhī-nāma (“Book of God”), the magic signet ring of Solomon, an
The simile “the sun is delivered from the dragon” in the romantic epic, Wīs u Rāmīn,112 almost certainly of Arsacid Parthian origin, expresses a related stance It was translated and versified by Fakhr al-Dīn Gurgānī around 1050 for the first Saljuq sulṭān Ṭoghrıl I, his minister Abū Naṣr ibn Manṣūr, and his governor Abu ’l-Fatḥ ibn Muḥammad of Iṣfahān The eleventh-century Iranian poet Masʿūd-i Saʿd-i Salmān (c. 440/1046–7–c. 515/1121–2) whose family came from Hamadān, enjoyed status and fame at the Ghaznawid courts of Lahore and Ghazna in his youth and again in his later years But he also suffered the misery of some eighteen years of incarceration, resulting in the prisonpoetry (ḥabsiyya) for which he is renowned and in which he metaphorically employs both fire and dragon imagery:
My heart has become like a fire temple, fearing it I don’t breath even for a moment, until from the heat of my dragon-like heart my mouth fills with fire
However he emerges from the dragon’s clutches “like a cool cypress in a garden”113 thereby employing the conventional metaphor which implies that he comes forth unscathed from an eclipse or other impending calamity Comparable imagery governs Niẓāmī Ganjawī’s description in the first part of his Iskandar-nāma, the Sharaf-nāma, of Iskandar’s destruction of the fire temples of the Iranian Zoroastrians during his conquest of Iran (an action for which the historical Alexander is not responsible but that perhaps reflects Niẓāmī’s vague memory of an Iranian religious resistance to Hellenism) 114 Iskandar arrives at a fire temple dominated by a powerful priestess, Āẓar Humā, who transforms herself into a fire-breathing black dragon to guard the holy fire of the temple, hence implying that the dark dragon protects the fire and therefore the light and, by association, the luminaries 115 Through his talismanic powers Balīnūs (Apollonius) helps to

allusion to the sun, is guarded by a dragon 121 By analogy, dragons flanking the cosmic ruler (figs 113–116), further increase the luminary symbolism of the ruler 122 Even more explicitly, Abu ’l-Ḥasan Farrukhī, the celebrated court poet of Sīstān (Seistan), links the luminous sun with the roaring dragon when he praises the character of his patron:
In your banquets, you are an illuminating sun In combat, you are a roaring dragon 123
Reminiscences of ancient cosmogonical notions may be gauged from Armenian lore recorded by Khorenatsi relating to the Median king Astyages, the Armenian arch-enemy referred to as Azhi Dahāka, the archetype of evil misrule, whose first wife, Anoysh, was called the “mother of the

a The encircling dragon
The iconography of the circular dragon biting its own tail, traditionally known by its Greek name as ouroboros, was also known in the Islamic tradition This type of imagery is vividly described in surviving textual sources The early medieval writer Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Kisāʾī who probably wrote not long before 1200 refers to the authority of Kaʿb al-Aḥbār, a yemenite convert to Islam (probably in 17/638), when portraying the creation of the Canopy and the Throne of God:
Then God created a great serpent to surround the Canopy Its head is of white pearl and its body is of gold Its eyes are two sapphires, and no one can comprehend the magnitude of the serpent except God It has forty thousand wings made of different kinds of jewels, and on each feather there stands an angel holding a jeweled lance, praising God and blessing His name When this serpent extols God, its exaltation overwhelms that of all angels 1
A related description of the girdling dragon is given by Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Qurṭubī, the thirteenth-century expert in ḥadīth, or sacred tradition, in a commentary on sūra 40 of the Qurʾān:
When God created the Throne, it said, ‘God has not created anything greater than myself,’ and exulted with joy out of pride God therefore caused it to be surrounded by a serpent having 70,000 wings, each wing having 70,000 feathers in it, each feather having in it 70,000 faces each face having in it 70,000 mouths, and each mouth having in it 70,000 tongues, with its mouths ejaculating every day the praises of God ..., the number of drops
of rain, the number of leaves of trees, the number of stones and earth, the number of days of this world, and the number of angels, – all these a number of times The serpent then twisted itself round the Throne which was taken up by only half the serpent while it remained twisted around it The Throne thereupon became humble 2
In the Jewish tradition a great silver serpent likewise encircles the machinery of the throne of king Solomon and by operating the wheelwork, activates the mechanism 3 It is of note that Solomon’s mechanical throne, which can be likened to a miniature universe, can only be put into motion by the serpent 4 In his Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ (“Tales on the Prophets”), Abū Isḥāq Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Thaʿlabī al-Nīsābūrī al-Shāfʿī (d 427/1035), describes the Kaʿba in Mecca, the central sanctuary of the Islamic world, as a divine throne that is circumscribed by a dragon:
Then Allāh surrounded it by a serpent ... this serpent wound itself around the throne and the latter reaches to half the height of the serpent which is winding itself around it 5
In the biography of the Prophet Muḥammad, al-Ḥalabī similarly relates how the serpent that dwells in the pit of the Kaʿba to guard the treasures there, would:
leave its dwelling place and appear glittering, viz it exposed itself in the sun upon the wall of the Kaʿba while its colour assumed a glittering appearance; and often it wound itself on the wall so that its tail approached its head [emphasis added] 6
al-anbiyāʾ, tr and ed Brinner, 2002, p 151 Wensinck (1916, repr 1978, p 62 and n 3) notes that there are also Greek images in which the serpent is wound around and ascends above the omphalos, which often has a sepulchral character (Elderkin, 1924, pp 109–16); for a discussion of the omphalos in literature, see Roscher, 1913, pl IX, no 6; and idem, 1914, pl I, no 1, pl II, nos 3, 4, 14 See also p 59 and n 102 6 Al-Sīra al-Ḥalabiyya, Cairo, 1292, vol 1, p 189, 3–5, as cited in Wensinck, 1916, repr 1978, p 64 and n 1

In the Islamic tradition (ḥadīth), as Wensinck points out, the description of the serpent is a metaphor for the ocean:
as the Ocean, the Mekkan [sic] serpent is glittering in the sun and as the Ocean it is black and white 7
The motif of the “serpent whose tail approached its head” is well-known in Semitic cosmography A key passage in the book of Job (26:12) states:
He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness
The inscribed circle refers to the line of the horizon, which separates the inhabited world from the waters that surround it 8 These waters are symbolised by Leviathan, “the encircler,” who is primarily a sea monster 9 The name of the biblical monster Leviathan (Hebr liwyātān) has been derived from lwh suggested by the Arabic lwy “turn,” “twist” and the Assyrian lamû “surround,” “encircle,”10 underscoring the probablility of an original serpent-like nature of Leviathan The same motif is used by the great Andalusian Arab mystic Muḥyi ’l-Dīn Ibn al-ʿArabī (560/1165–638/1240) whose works draw on many sources, including Gnostic, Hermetic and Neoplatonic works In his discussion of the Pole (quṭb; an elevated rank of sainthood in ṣūfī mysticism) that represents the living Messenger (rasūl) in the Kitab al-manzil al-quṭb (“Book of the Spiritual Dwelling of the Pole”), he describes an enormous serpent whose head and tail touch and that encircles Mount Qāf:
The Pole is both the centre of the circle of the universe, and its circumference He is the mirror of God, and the pivot of the world ... God is perpetually epiphanized to him ... He is located in Mecca, whatever place he happens to be in bodily When a Pole is enthroned at the level of the quṭbiyya, all beings, animal or vegetable,
make covenant with him ... This explains the story about the man who saw the huge snake that God had placed around Mount Qāf, which encircles the world The head and the tail of this snake meet The man greeted the snake, who returned his greeting and then asked him about Shaykh Abū Madyan, who lived at Bijāya in the Maghrib The man said to it, “How do you come to know Abū Madyan?” The snake answered, “Is there anyone on earth who does not know him?11
According to a saying of the Prophet Muḥammad, Mount Qāf is separated from the world “by a region which men cannot cross, a dark area which would stretch for four months walking ”12 It was thus a distant, marginal area at the boundaries of the “civilised” world 13 Such liminal regions were often inhabited by demons Descriptions of dragons and other mythical creatures abound in such regions in the descriptions of medieval Islamic geographical and travel works 14 Their topical proliferation serves as a “cultural marker” (in James Montgomery’s words) indicating to the traveller that he is in a distant land 15 Together with other imaginary hybrid creatures, such as sphinxes and harpies, the presence of the dragon may have signified the outer reaches of the known earth This vision of the fabulous distant lands at the remote ends of the world is also found in the Alexander Romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes In this legend many wondrous feats are ascribed to Iskandar who made his way to the furthest west and furthest east, the end of the world, entering the “regions not illuminated by the Sun, the Moon and the stars and light as day” where he encounters creatures such as human-headed birds 16 However, Mount Qāf does not only encircle the earth: it also encloses the ocean which “forms a girdle around the earth ”17 The symbolism also occurs in the story of Solomon of the Alf layla wa-layla which recounts how Solomon on his fly

ing carpet travels through the world and reaches the dragon that encompasses the world 18 According to a popular belief recorded by al-Qazwīnī, the earth is supported by the biblical monsters Leviathan and Behemoth 19 Later Jewish tradition similarly states that:
the Ocean surrounds the whole world as a vault surrounds a large pillar And the world is placed in circular form on the fins of Leviathan 20
Similarly a large serpent is said to encircle the bier of a righteous person, a tradition which provides a microcosmic allegory of the whole world surrounded and supported by a giant serpent 21 It also shows that the Islamic conceptions are in some way connected with ancient biblical notions, which in turn have precedents in the Babylonian tradition of chaos 22 In his short tractate, the Sod ha-Nachasch u-Mischpato (“Mystery of the Serpent”), the thirteenth-century kabbalist, Joseph Gikatilla ben Abraham, a disciple of the Spanish mystic Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (1240–c 1292), sheds some light on the mystery of the mythical creature as a liminal symbol, situated upon the ambiguous dividing line between the divine and the demonic:
Know that from the outset of its creation the serpent represented something important and necessary for harmony so long as it stood in its place It was the Great Servant who had been created to carry the yoke of both sovereignty and service Its head surmounted the heights of the earth and its tail reached into the depths of hell yet in all worlds it had a befitting place and represented something extraordinarily significant for the harmony of all stages, each one in its place And this is the secret of the serpent of heaven that is known from the Sefer Yezira, and that sets in motion the spheres and their cycle from east to west and from north to south And without it no creature in the sublunar world had life, and
there would be no sowing and no growth and no motivation for the reproduction of all creatures This serpent now stood originally outside the walls of the sacred precincts and was connected from the outside with the outer wall, since its tail was linked with the wall whereas its countenance was oriented inwards It did not befit it to enter the inside, but its place and law was to affect the creation of growth and reproduction from the outside, and this is the secret of the tree and the knowledge of good and evil 23
This world serpent, which likewise serves as liminal motif between order and chaos by encircling the cosmos, in other words the realm of order, was a symbol of great antiquity in the Mesopotamian world and beyond 24 The writings of mystics such as Ibn al-ʿArabī were also influenced by the esoteric science of alchemy (al-kīmiyāʾ), considered a form of revealed knowledge that had both its spiritual goals and practical applications A special alchemical symbol is that of the tail-eating serpent, known as ouroboros (the etymology is from oura, “tail,” and the root of bora, “food,” boros, “voracious”) 25 Among the large pseudo-epigraphic literature of alchemical books composed in the medieval period, an Arabic alchemical treatise titled Muṣḥaf al-ḥakīm Usṭānis fī-l-ṣināʿat al-ilāhiyya (“Book of the Wise Ostanes on Divine Art”) is attributed to Ostanes (Uṣtānis), the renowned Median author of books on magic and gnosis of the Achaemenid period 26 It describes how in a dream a creature with serpent’s tail, eagle’s wings and elephant’s head devouring its own tail (like a serpent) guides Ostanes up to the seven gates of wisdom for which it gives him the keys 27 An important corpus of alchemical writings, compiled at the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth century, is attributed to the celebrated alchemist Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (d c 196/812), allegedly from Ṭūs in Khurasan,28 who according to tradition was a personal friend of the sixth Shīʿite

imām Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (81/700–147/765) who initiated him into alchemy and secret teachings 29 In his Kitāb al-aḥjār (“Book of Stones”) Jābir ibn Ḥayyān includes several recipes for creating beasts such as serpents 30 The earliest texts of the corpus are thought to have originated in the scientific culture of the great cultural oases the Oxus (Āmū Daryā) and Jaxartes (Syr Daryā) rivers: Marw, Balkh, Khiva, Samarqand and Bukhara, the traditional roads of exchange between east and west, from where it was transmitted to the rest of the Islamic world 31 Another work was the Tabula Smaragdina (“Emerald Tablet”) attributed by Islamic sources to Hermes, which purported to reveal the key to the ultimate secret of alchemy, and which was included in the Kitāb Sirr al-Khaliqā wa Ṣanʿat al-Ṭabīʿa (“Book of the Secret of Creation and the Art (of Reproducing) Nature”), written in the mid-seventh century or later in about 205/820 under the caliph Maʾmun 32 Julius Ruska, who translated the text, was the first to suggest that its origin lay further east 33 He similarly proposes that its genesis should be sought in “the great cultureoases in the region of the Oxus and the Jaxartes rivers, of Merv and Balkh, or Khiva, Bokhara and Samarqand, those great cities which since ancient times have seen the exchange of material and intellectual goods between west and east, and where Greek traditions endured for such a surprisingly long time ”34 Ruska visualises these cities at the crossroads of Asia north and east of the Sasanian empire as filled with a mixed population of Iranians, Tūrānians, Syrians, Indians, and Chinese,35 places where Buddhism, Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity and Chinese cults coexisted Here the sciences of astrology, alchemy and macrobiotics were very much alive 36 The close analogies especially in the account of cosmic Creation with Chinese alchemy have been pointed out by Joseph Needham and Ling Wang 37 The text
expresses the alchemical concept of heat acting as male, cold as female, and their union producing humidity and dryness, which has close parallels to the Chinese theories of yin and yang 38 However, these correlations could only happen due to a “trans-Asian continuity” from ancient times that was greatly enhanced after the conquests of Alexander (r 336–323 bc), son of Philip II, king of Macedonia, and later through the traveller and explorer Chang Chhien’s diplomatic and commercial expeditions (fl c 138–126 bc) 39 In a text known as the “Congress of Philosophers” (surviving only in a twelfth-century Latin translation and hence lacking its original Arabic title), tentatively dated to c 900 and attributed to a certain Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn ʿAlī al-Kasdānī, better known as Ibn Waḥshiyya al-Nabaṭī and the Muṣḥaf al-jamāʿa of the Turba philosophorum, a symposium of philosophers and alchemists voice their divergent opinions 40 In the speech of “Socrates” chemical reaction is compared with generation, lead is male and orpiment female According to “Diamedes” both male and female substances are needed, mercury relating to the former and sulphur to the latter “Ostanes” makes copper female and mercury male, while “Theophilus” offers allegories of nights between husband and wife, etc 41 The great emphasis on sexuality in chemical substances and reactions that are detailed in the Turba philosophorum is one of the main characteristics of alchemy This is based on the belief in a universal sympathy that ultimately unites all parts of the universe, metals and stones (which are alive), males and females 42 Further, the uniting of the opposite principles female/male, passive/ active, cold/hot, humidity/dryness finds expression in the coupling of the Sun and the Moon, a cosmological motif of central importance since it symbolises the generation of all things 43 It is believed that all metals are a result of their union

is recreated in the self-devouring 50 In the symbolism of medieval Islamic alchemy, the paired interlaced dragons represented a fundamental polarity, on which the cosmic rhythm is based, the solve et coagula of the alchemical process: the sulphur and mercury of alchemy 51 This double aspect is echoed in the popular belief, mentioned earlier, that the earth is supported by the biblical monsters Leviathan and Behemoth 52 It is also found in rabbinic tradition where it is stated that:
Behemoth and Leviathan are serpents (monsters) on the edge of the ocean who encircle the earth like a ring 53
Concerning nāḥāsh ʿāqallāṭōn in Isaiah 27:1 the Talmudic commentator Rashi (c 1040–1105) similarly remarks that “this entwined Leviathan surrounds the whole earth” [emphasis added] 54 The ouroboros symbol was especially important for the Ophite (from ophis, the Greek for “serpent”) Gnostics 55 In the ancient Orphic mystery the great dragon was the sphere of the Sun, the supreme cosmic force, the good spirit of light, stretched like a radiant ribbon around the rim of the heaven of fixed stars; closely related to the four winds, the four quarters of the cosmos and the four seasons 56 Writing in c 400, Macrobius, moreover, describes the iconography of the dragon, which encompasses the world tail in its mouth, as like the forward and backward looking god Janus, a visible image of the universe which feeds on itself and returns to itself again 57 However in some Gnostic-Christian writings such as the Pistis Sophia (c fourth century),58 in which belief in heavenly bodies and demonology are closely connected, the serpent became the

Antichrist and Satan, the Leviathan of the Old Testament 59 The Pistis Sophia, which claims to record the teachings of Jesus during the eleven years following his resurrection, states:
The outer darkness is a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth, and it is outside the world, and it surrounds the whole world 60
Significantly, in the apocalypse of the heavens the Sun appears as a great dragon accompanied by the seven planets and with the four horses61 that in Greek mythology drew the chariot of the sun god Helios (sol invictus), while the Moon is depicted as steered by a male and a female dragon and drawn by two white bulls 62 Nevertheless, the ancient conceptions of the serpent resurface in the Gospel of John in the New Testament (3:14) As noted earlier, the serpent lifted up by Moses is presented in the Epistle of Barnabas as a symbol of Jesus and of Christianity 63 The formula, “I am the alpha and the omega,” meaning “in my beginning is my end and in my end is my beginning,” also leads to the imagery of the ouroboros serpent, symbol of the unity and eternal renewal of life 64 The ouroboros motif reached its apogee during the Gnostic period, which lasted from the second century bc to the third century ad, when the Greek and West Asian cultures were subsumed by a form of pan-Hellenism 65 It is of significance, however, that the symbol had not been known in Classical Greek, Etruscan or early Roman culture 66 Thus the ouroboros symbol came to serve as an image for a complex of ideas that was known by a Greek name An ouroboros serpent that encircles a lion, surmounted by a crescent and star, engraved on a
fifth-century Sasanian seal (fig 150),67 suggests that the Sasanian representations of the serpent biting its own tail may perhaps be based on conventional renderings of the dragon in contemporaneous star-maps inspired by astrological works of the Hellenistic east 68 In Hellenic astrology, the great celestial serpent (draco coelestis) dominated the heavens, encompassing all the spheres of the cosmos, coiling around the heavens and biting its tail 69 yet it is important also to consider the reverse of the seal, which depicts a palm tree above a pair of outspread wings with small streamers surrounded either by a decorative border or a more stylised ouroboros 70 Since this represents a rare iconographic variant, Rika Gyselen tentatively suggests a magical interpretation of the seal 71 The motif of the paired encircling dragons also makes an appearance in the well-known legend of the Ascent of Iskandar Certain editions of the romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes (c fourth century) describe how, as Iskandar is carried to heaven by eagles, he sees a field encircled by a serpent which is explained as the world surrounded by the ocean 72 The depiction of this scene also reflects the force and ongoing cultural resonance which the Alexander Romance possessed at the time; in particular, the meaning associated with this imagery It is portrayed on a small Byzantine enamelled medallion of the eleventh century from the Pala d’Oro on the high altar of St Mark’s, now preserved in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice, representing the schematised composition of Iskandar’s view of the world as seen from on high (fig 151) 73 The plaque is decorated with a large central tree inhabited by birds and flanked by a pair of addorsed peacocks with their heads turned backwards The composition is encircled

by a pair of giant serpents with looped bodies and interlaced tails The significance of this imagery is underlined by Grabar who identifies it as highly characteristic of the Iranian repertoire of motifs, stating that “this image of the Universe, a distinctly Iranian iconography, deserved to be introduced into the family of medieval representations of the Cosmos ”74 Similarly the tree and the birds represented on the plaque, as Grabar has observed, represent “Iranian symbols of the garden of the Earth; in the text of the legend they are documented with the words: “fruits of the Earth ””75 The Latin version of the text states: “orbis terrarum sicut area, in qua conduntur fruges ”76 This form of imagery thus provides a bird’s eye view of the terrestrial universe current in the medieval Iranised Central Asian sphere The motif was here adapted to a Christian context and, as Grabar notes, it is possible that the stylised cruciform motif on the apex of the tree represents a Christian cross which served to “convert” this oriental representation of the universe into a Christian one 77 Evidently the motif had wide currency in the medieval world, both Muslim and Byzantine The origin of this iconography may plausibly be seen to lie in the Zoroastrian cosmological motif of the Saēna Tree, the perch of the great mythical Saēna bird (Av saēna-mərəγa-, Mid Pers sēn murw, Pers sīmorḡ) 78 The tree on which the Saēna nests grows in the middle of Lake Vārukasha (yasht 12 17) and is called Vīspō bish (the Gaokərəna-Tree, Mid Pers Gōkirn), Tree of All Remedies, because it bears the seed of all healing herbs 79 According to the Bundahishn the revered Vāsī Panchā sadvarā lives in the lake (yasht 42 4) It appears to be a kind of sea dragon and is “so huge that if it were to rush swiftly along from sunrise to sunset it still would not have covered as much ground as the length of its own body;
it rules over all denizens of the waters ”80 Islamic cosmological notions speak of the “Lote Tree on the Boundary” (sidrat al-muntahā), also known as ṭubā (“blessed”) 81 The Qurʾān describes how when the Prophet was carried on his night journey (miʿrāj) up to the seventh heaven, he went on as far as the sidrat al-muntahā beyond which no angel or any other being can pass This tree is located to the right of the divine throne (ʿarsh) and near the garden of the eternal abode (sūra 53, 14–5) 82 An emblematic illustration of the city of Babylon in the manuscripts of Beatus’ Commentary on the Apocalypse shows the theme of two giant serpents enclosing a city Discussing this coincidence of imagery John Williams comments that “Christian culture shared iconographic traditions associated with the Muslim world...”83 Babylon, which must have been notorious for its dragons, was also known in Iranian tradition as the location of the giant dragon Dahāka 84 The illustration of the city of Babylon serves as frontispiece for the Daniel Commentary (1 1 and 14 23) in two tenth-century manuscripts, the Morgan Beatus, dated between c 940 and 945 (fig 152), and the Girona Beatus, dated 6 July 975,85 as well as in one mid-eleventh-century manuscript, the Saint-Sever Beatus from the monastery of Saint-Sever-sur-l’Adour (on which the city is shown to be enclosed by two dragons whose heads and tails entwine at top and bottom) 86 In the Morgan Beatus Babylon is shown as a towering city with a large horseshoe arch-shaped main city gate framed by an inverted pair of small dragons, who touch at the tail tips, in such a manner that their undulant bodies seem to form an ogee arch-shaped enclosure around the gate The entire composition is encircled by a sequence of two giant dragons demarcated by a fine spotted pattern in anti-clockwise arrangement, the gaping

dragons’ snouts revealing a long tongue which nearly touches the tail of the preceding dragon Williams refers to an ancient Slavic version of a Byzantine epic of the city of Babylon87 which may further elucidate the imagery of the dragons encircling the city According to this story, thought to be of Indo-Iranian origin,88 Nebuchadnezzar rebuilt a new city on top of “seven rocks and seven stations,” the entire city being surrounded by the body of a giant dragon whose mouth and tail unite to form the gate 89 Nebuchadnezzar also had a large sword made for himself in the form of a dragon which had magical powers and could act autonomously 90 The image of the dragon was, in addition, chosen by the king as coat of arms of the city, and as such was applied to garments, weapons, military standards, horse harnesses and saddles, roof beams, doors and windows, vessels, plates, bowls and spoons 91 In case of war all the “heraldic” dragons would come to life and devour the army of the enemy 92 In the same account of Babylon it is said that following the king’s death, failure to observe his commandments led to an inversion of the protective powers of the dragon The narrative later reveals that the singing of a hymn in praise of God made the initially hostile dragons recoil as if to form a knot 93 This version of the epic thus makes it clear that the dragon was seen not only as a creature that struck fear in people’s hearts, but as guardian of the city with inherent apotropaic powers 94 It suggests that the encircling dragons performed a protective function as well It is interesting to consider, moreover, that the conspicuous knotting characteristic of many dragon representations, a topic examined in the following chapter, may be an indication that the fierce aspect of the dragon is contained once its body forms a knot The encircling dragon iconography is also found on architectural elements such as a carved wooden door, once possibly part of a mausoleum 95 The door, dated to the first half of the thirteenth-century, is thought to come from the Tigris region, and is now preserved in the Museum für Islamische Kunst in Berlin (fig 153) 96 It is carved with a pair of large dragons surrounding a cen
tral medallion set within an arch-shaped frame The latter contains an interlaced infinite star pattern, in turn outlined by an interlaced pearled band which extends at its apex into a small medallion It is touched on either side by the sinuous tongues projecting from the gaping mouths of the dragons whose scaly serpentine bodies with raised slender wings wind tightly around the medallion Their bodies form a pretzel-like knot and then two loops, the tail tips tapering to a point to form a tight curl at the base On account of the surface wear of the door only the frame of the small medallion is extant, one can therefore only speculate what it was that the dragons were protecting or threatening A similar conceptualisation governs the depiction on a large bas-relief stone fragment carved with a pair of antithetically arranged dragons that frame a large mutlilayered composite rayed orb which carries clear solar associations, discovered near Alaeddin Tepe in Konya, now in the İnce Minare Müzesi in Konya (fig 154) It was probably part of a thirteenth-century Saljuqid monument, which no longer exists Only the dragon head to the left is complete, portrayed with a long, curved wide-open snout revealing sharp teeth and fangs along with a prominent sinuous tongue the tip of which touches the edge of the star rosette The head is punctuated with almond-shaped eyes framed by long, curved lashes and crowned by a small, rounded ear At the back of the head the dragon’s neck is clasped by paired “collars,” the upper part braided, the lower marked with vertical hatching The long scaly ophidian bodies form a loop and then a pretzel-like knot The bottom section of the stone is broken off so the tail tips are lost Likewise, only part of the pretzel-like knot of the dragon to the right has survived A more complex form which may be related to the encircling motif graces the small “Kiosk Mosque” situated in the courtyard of the double-section caravanserai Sultan Han, near Kayseri (between 629/1232 and 633/1236) discussed in detail in chapter 2 Here the confronted serpent festoons end in small dragon heads, the necks bent inwards and the open jaws holding the tips

of the outer festoon-band They thus appear to “swallow” or “deliver” their own tails (fig 13) An analogy may further be drawn to the interlaced dragons that enclose the ogival arches carved with figural compositions on the portals of the Imām Bahir Mausoleum in Mosul (fig 19) and the Mār Behnām Monastery southeast of Mosul (fig 18) The ouroboros aspect is further evident in the double frontispiece of the Kitāb al-diryāq (“Book of the Theriac,” often referred to as “Book of Antidotes”), dated 595/1199, in the collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, on which the encircling dragons are juxtaposed with the personification of the Moon (fig 176), examined below in chapter 11 Although of course realised in an entirely different medium, the representations in stone and on paper probably share a relatively close geographic provenance and period of production The astral personification on the Pseudo-Galen double frontispiece, moreover, might provide a link between what appear to be composite stellar symbols on the Berlin door (fig 153) and the Konya architectural stone fragment (fig 154) The motif also features conspicuously on several Kashan-style ceramic vessels that are overglaze painted with lustre; here the encircling imagery is rendered in the form of interlacing bands comprising multiple pairs of “Saljuqstyle” dragons with small pointed ears and gaping snouts with thin projecting tongues circumscribing a central composition 97 On one bowl, now preserved in Chicago, in the Harvey B Plotnick Collection, the ophidian bodies of the mythical creatures encircle a well-known motif, often portrayed on early thirteenth-century Kashan-style ceramic bowls, of two seated human figures conversing Portrayed with three-quarter facing large “moon-shaped” faces with long almond-shaped eyes, arched eyebrows and gently smiling lips, flanked by long tresses embellished with diadems and flowing over the shoulders, the figures conform to the standards of ideal beauty that prevailed in Islamic lands ruled by Western Asian dynasties from the tenth century onwards 98 The
composition is encircled by an interlaced band formed of six pairs of dragons terminating in paired confronting heads with gaping mouths and projecting tongues (composed of very fine flame-like lines) Their alternately spotted and finely scaled bodies form evenly spaced circular enclosures containing vegetal motifs The serpentine interlace is in turn framed by epigraphic bands in Kufic and cursive script in Arabic and Persian (fig 155) The main theme of the inscriptions is love, the longing for the beloved and the anguish and suffering occasioned by love 99 These sentiments are reflected by the two human figures whose thoughtful interaction is underlined by a distinctive right-handed gesture with delicate finger movement by one of the figures, while the other has folded hands 100 The introspective experience of personal love was perceived as a crucial element in following the path to virtue and attaining moral perfectibility 101 This microcosmic ideal is aptly framed by the interlaced dragons The tall cylindrical body of a Kashan-style ewer of the same period and in a closely related style, now preserved in Paris, Musée du Louvre, is similarly encircled by eight pairs of intertwining dragons whose heads with wide-open mouths and projecting tongues confront each other on the rounded shoulder The bodies of the fabulous beasts define five horizontal registers filled with cursive epigraphic bands in Persian written in reserve on a lustre-painted ground 102 It may be inferred that, although generally perceived to be a mere decorative device on Saljuq-period objects, the iconography of encircling dragons may well have conveyed some cosmological and, possibly, mythological significance The encircling dragon motif is also found on textiles, which were a key luxury item for circulation Their eminent portability and high status within the medieval Islamic and Eastern Christian cultures assured their important role in establishing an international visual vocabulary 103 This led to shared decorative themes in Islamic and Byzantine textiles, and consequently to frequent

difficulties in distinguishing between centres of production 104 The iconographic scheme of encircling serpents is clearly rendered on an eleventh- or early twelfth-century wine-red and gold samite, the socalled relic cover of Saint Amandus, one part of which is preserved in the Abegg-Stiftung in Riggisberg, the other in the Cleveland Museum of Art 105 The textile fragments, which are thought to have a Western Asian provenance, possibly from the Saljuq realm, figure staggered beaded escutcheon-shaped medallions enclosing gigantic double-headed eagles with their wings outspread The eagles surmount pairs of addorsed feline quadrupeds whose tails also terminate in dragon heads with gaping jaws A pair of giant double-headed dragons encloses the entire composition (fig 156) An extended form of the encircling dragon motif is also found on the lining fabrics of the coronation mantle of Roger II (r 1130–1154), the Norman ruler of Sicily and southern Italy The outer face of the red silk cloak, which was woven in the royal workshop (dār al-ṭirāz) in Palermo and carries an inscription in Kufic dating it to the year 528/1133–4, is embroidered with gold thread and pearls with a central palm tree separating addorsed tigers attacking camels 106 This iconography not only represents the cosmological and emblematic motifs that symbolised Roger’s claim to power, but also creates a link beyond the western Norman domain to the Islamic sphere, which is underlined by the fact that the embroidered inscription along the lower hem of the garment is written in Arabic, a language used at Roger’s court and in which he was fluent 107 In
view of the king’s controversial status the imagery on the mantle would have been expected to convey the legitimacy of his position The lining, however, would remain largely unseen, revealing only glimpses of the imagery which was therefore mainly reserved for the person of the king The lining fabrics comprise five successive sections from three different textiles that are, according to the motifs, commonly referred to as the “Dragon,” the “Tree of Life,” and the “Bird” cloth (figs 157a and b) 108 All three types show a gridlike lattice composed of paired interlaced dragons with projecting tongues that define the overall surface and enclose groups of human figures, trees, birds and foliate motifs A beaded rinceau runs along the body of one of the serpents while the body of the other is marked by evenly spaced stripes 109 Since this imagery was chosen for the lining of the coronation mantle, a highly official and ceremonial vestment, its symbolic content must have been imbued with a special significance While the outer face was intended as a visual statement of the king’s claim to power and authority, the inner one may be seen as having an implicit talismanic intent This may be compared to the use of talismanic shirts covered with Qurʾānic verses often in conjunction with astrological and magical practices and devices that were often worn under the outer garments (or armour) and of which a considerable number of Turko-Iranian examples are recorded 110 These shirts were destined to protect the owner, avert injury or illness, and thereby bestow invulnerability The encircling dragon motif which decorates the lining fabric that covers the inside of the coronation mantle may therefore be presumed to

have been intended not only to protect the king but also to endow him with certain abilities or powers Research into the silk and gold thread textiles underlines on the one hand the characteristics of Byzantine court production, the panni imperiali, while on the other pointing to stylistic features pertaining to Central Asia and the Ancient Orient The closely related iconographies indicate the use of pattern books that seem to have circulated among different workshops involved in making the “golden textiles ” In view of the complexity of cultural identification, Eva Hoffmann proposes the existence of a “shared textile vocabulary of the international courts between the tenth and the twelfth centuries from Islamic, Byzantine and Norman centres ”111 The possibility of an eastern, and perhaps Central Asian, provenance for the overall iconography is strengthened by the discovery of a silk fragment from Samangan province in Afghanistan, now preserved in the al-Sabāh Collection in Kuwait (figs 158a and b) In the same manner as on the “Bird Cloth,” the Samangan fragment also shows a large, inverted pretzel-like interlace, formed by the ophidian bodies of four serpent-dragons All the details of the iconographic expression, including palmette-like trees flanked by perched birds in the lobes of the interlace and the beaded or striped demarcation of the ophidian bodies as well as their projecting red tongues, are near-identical to those of the “Bird Cloth” (fig 157a and b) It would certainly be wrong to attempt to assign the motif to a single artistic tradition However, it is worthy of note that the motifs enclosed by the confronted giant dragons that divide up the entire surface include the ancient Iranian cosmological motif of the tree with birds This motif is closely related to the representation on the Byzantine enamelled medallion from the Pala d’Oro (fig 151) which, although it was made in Constantinople, was clearly inspired by Iranian and Central Asian visual expressions This artistic tradition permeates also the more complex iconography on the “Bird Cloth” lining fabric found in the coronation mantle of Roger II Even though it would at first sight seem likely that the lining fabrics were inserted at the time the coronation mantle of Roger II was made (dated 528/1133–4),
Anne Wardwell has tentatively dated another silk and gold textile decorated with parallel curving vines which also forms part of the lining of the mantle to the period between the third decade and the last quarter of the thirteenth century,112 hence suggesting that a section of the lining was added at a later date The al-Sabāh textile has been radiocarbon dated to between 1154 and 1282 Regrettably, the test results are not specific enough to be able to determine in which of the two centuries the textile was fashioned The Samangan fragment with three-partite heart-shaped knots fashioned of serpent-dragons certainly underlines the wide circulation of this significant iconographic representation The continued use of a motif associated with ancient Iranian ideas is not surprising given that, despite the triumph of Islam, the people of the eastern Islamic lands hung on to their preIslamic roots and associated iconographic notions more assiduously than those in most other areas of the Islamic world
b The drinking dragon
It is interesting to consider the exceptional motif of the drinking dragon which is depicted on the so-called “Dragon Cloth” section of the lining of the coronation mantle of Roger II The openmouthed dragon heads are shown with projecting tongues, apparently lapping from the contents of the stemmed cups (fig 159) 113 The same motif is found above the lintel of the southern outer door of the monastery of Mār Behnām/Deir al-Khiḍr, an important place of pilgrimage associated with miraculous healing by both Christians and Muslims The two addorsed intertwined dragons are portrayed with wide-open mouths and long tongues with entwined bifid tips that also appear to drink from a stemmed cup (fig 160) The same visual formulation can be observed in an illustration in the Vani Gospels, a Georgian manuscript transcribed and illuminated in Constantinople at Romani Monastery by the Georgian monk Ioane for the celebrated Georgian queen Tʿamar (1184–1211/2) in c 1200 A canon table set within an architectural frame of columns supporting arches is surmounted at the apex by paired serpents that lap with bifid tongues at the liquid

contained within a chalice (fig 161) The foot of the chalice is held in place by the interlaced reptilian bodies, patterned with scales, which spring from the base of a four-columned structure that holds up a fountain, probably representing the “Fountain of Life,” underlining the paradisiac symbolism associated with the illumination of canon tables 114 The composition is flanked by winged mythical creatures, a griffin to the left and a sphinx-like being playing a stringed instrument on the right The symbolism of a dragon with its head placed close to the vessel as if eager to reach the contents while its body serves as handle attached to jugs and ewers had been known since ancient times 115 The motif became formalised in the post-Sasanian period with the body of the dragon becoming more stylised 116 This type of imagery in which the gaping snout of a dragon head holds the rim of a vessel above a handle or, alternatively, releases the liquid when it serves as spout (fig 35), is associated with the reading of the dragon as beneficent custodian, safeguarding the precious contents of the vessel The dragon’s role as a beneficent creature, guardian of the liquid of vessels, evoked in the figure of a winged and horned dragon with elongated snout and open jaws, reaching towards the folded lip of a vessel while the frontlegs hold onto the side wall just below the rim, is featured on a late seventh- or early eighth-century pear-shaped gold jug of unknown provenance, preserved in the Moscow Historical Museum (fig 162) 117 The
proximity of the dragon protome to the vessel’s rim, which is rendered as if eager to reach for the contents, was perhaps seen as token of the liquid’s protection The motif of a serpent lapping from a vessel was a well-known theme in depictions of Greek mythology 118 It appears on a sixth-century Byzantine gilded silver dish, preserved in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, an example of the reception of Dionysiac motifs in sixth-century Byzantine art 119 It shows a young woman with one knee bent at a right angle, opening with one hand the lid of a cylindrical container from which a serpent is emerging, while with the other holding a calyx-like vessel, from whose contents the serpent is lapping The container has been identified as cista mystica, the iconographic emblem of the Eleusinian and Bacchic mysteries to which in late Hellenistic times a serpent issuing from the sacred cista was added 120 The female figure is probably associated with a mystery cult, perhaps representing a maenad, one of the female followers of the god Dionysos (fig 163) 121 A similar motif is associated with Hygieia, goddess of medicine, whose cult spread with that of her mythical father Asklepios and who like her father is invariably associated with a serpent, sometimes shown as drinking from a bowl held in her hand 122 The motif of the lapping dragon, which seems to be rooted in Dionysiac lore, was also known in early Kushan-period Gandhāra (present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan) It is exemplified on a schist relief (fig 164) with a nude boy (eros or putto)

contained snake venom Already in classical antiquity it was quite well-known that a viper’s venom is harmful only if it enters directly into a person's blood stream (that is, through an open wound) but not if it is imbibed See idem, pp 433452, with further examples of “miracles” involving the drinking of snake venom 126 See p 119, n 85 127 Cf the example of an eleventh- or early twelfthcentury Byzantine encyclopaedia of the Metaphrastian Menologion, n 986 Cf Walter, 2003, pp 52–3 128 Sinai, Monastery of Saint Catherine, gr 508, fol 234v: Inde and Domna (6F7) See Patterson Ševčenko, 1990, p 156 129 Cf the parallel transmission of the Dionysiac animal, the panther or lynx, into Sasanian and post-Sasanian art and the concluding remarks of Ettinghausen, 1972, p 10 Note also the use of both serpent and feline (in this case interpreted as lion) on the handle of the Bobrinsky bucket (idem, fig 125)
attempting to quench the thirst of a dragon who seems to lap from the contents of a bowl that is offered while a second boy, also holding a cup, rides sideways on its back 123 In Christian iconography the Dionysiac symbol of the cup or the kantharos took on a new significance by becoming the Eucharistic chalice 124 The motif of the drinking serpent appears as the serpent-topped chalice of John the Evangelist 125 While it is likely that this form of imagery was initially imbued with ideas of healing and salvation, associated with the beneficial aspect of the serpent, the same motif later increasingly came to be reinterpreted and reformulated in a negative sense when the meaning of the myth associated with the serpent was inverted As a result of this process the (serpent-)dragon assumed an overall meaning as symbol and instrument of a fiendish force in Christian imagery, thus frequently bearing the traces of the mental and cultural shift imposed by the new religious system 126 In the new Christian context, numerous hagiographic and other traditions created a restructured version of ancient mythical themes pertaining to the dragon In consequence, there was a shift in mythological paradigm, the force of the earlier myth died, was changed or suppressed and only vestiges of it remain This inversion of meaning is
attested in the eleventh- or early twelfth-century Byzantine encyclopaedia of the Metaphrastian Menologion volumes featuring so-called “revenge miniatures ”127 These show the crowned figures of Roman tyrants responsible for the deaths of martyred saints, associated with a serpent or dragon seen as an embodiment or emissary of Satan One of these depictions portrays a crowned figure, probably representing the emperor Maximian, holding a vessel from which a serpent is drink
ing 128
Hence it is a reasonable conjecture that the drinking dragons on the “Dragon Cloth” section of the lining of the coronation mantle of Roger II, those over the door at the monastery of Mār Behnām and those in the Vani Gospels all belong to the same symbolic group, representing the visual remnants that survived the mutations of ancient beliefs The basic association between the vessel as container of liquid and the dragon was so strong that it survived in different forms even though the original iconographic association had perhaps long been forgotten 129 Vestiges of the importance of its former cultic associations can however still be gauged from the “revenge miniatures” in which the original intent of the iconography of the drinking serpent was inverted and survives in corrupted form

the knotted dragon motif 159
a The ancient practice of knot tying
From ancient times the tying of magical knots was a way of binding magical/supernatural powers 1 The ritual practice of tying knots in a cord and blowing on them was one of the most common forms of harmful or therapeutic magic in preIslamic times 2 The practice is connected with the concept of binding spells whose knots cannot be unloosed, thus drawing on the principles of sympathetic magic with the purpose of rendering the victim generally impotent 3 Serpent charming may be interpreted in a similar manner since the serpents are “bound” by the charmer 4 The knotted representations are used as symbols to conjure up the cosmic powers that are appropriate to effectively protect or, conversely, harm individuals as well as human communities 5 Such “binding spells” are frequently employed on Aramaic and Mandaic incantation bowls In these the magician threatens to employ a spell such as he has used to bind the sea and the dragon Leviathan, and to
bind the victim with the same bonds as those constraining the sky, the earth and the seven planets 6 The Qurʾān warns of “the evil (arising) from those who blow (or spit) upon the knots” (sūra 113, 4), a practice analogous to that known as “tying the aglet,” designed to keep husbands and wives apart 7 It is notable that sūras 113 and 114 are called al-muʿawwidhatān (“the two who preserve”) and their verses are considered of special talismanic power if recited in tandem with the original signification of blowing upon the knots 8 Interestingly, sūra 113 refers to the evil women “who blow upon knots,” and for this reason it is believed to be “particularly efficacious against the ills of the flesh ”9 In his commentary on sūra 113, the thirteenthcentury Qurʾānic exegete al-Bayḍāwī refers to a related account according to which a Jew cast a magic spell on the Prophet Muḥammad by putting a cord with eleven knots into a well, whereupon he fell ill 10 After the revelation of sūras 113 and 114, the archangel Jibrāʾīl disclosed the cause of
means by which the theurgists induced the gods to certain actions Cf Chwolsohn, 1856, vol 2, p 138, n 144 6 “Wenn ihr irgend etwas gegen ... unternehmt, dann werde ich euch bezaubern mit der großen Bezauberung des Meeres und mit der Bezauberung des Ungeheuers Leviathan ... biege ich den Bogen gegen euch und spanne die Sehne gegen euch bringe ich herab auf euch den Beschluß des Himmels und den Bann, den ich auf den Berg [Hermon] und auf das Ungeheuer Leviathan gelegt habe ... [binde ich euch mit der Bindung], durch die Himmel und Erde gebunden wurden ... binde ich euch mit der Bindung, durch welche die sieben Planeten gebunden wurden ” Niggemeyer, 1975, pp 70, 146 7 Fahd, “Siḥr,” EI2 IX, 567b 8 It is however remarkable that the idiom “blowing on magical knots” was still metaphorically used during the tenth-century as attested by al-Thaʿālibī’s account of the literary life at the Samanid court where:
men of letters [were] each offering to the other fragrant flowers of dialectic, and pursuing the perfumes of Culture, and letting fall in succession necklaces of pearls, and blowing on magical knots [emphasis added]

1 In Mesopotamian magic texts the verb “to bind” (Akkadian kasâru) was used to express the concept of “bewitchment” (Astour, 1968, p 18) Inversely, in lengthy litanies the help of the gods was invoked to undo or dissolve the knot of a magic spell or charm which was believed to have supernatural powers (Dhorme, 1949, p 261) In like manner the texts describe the role of the conjurer as the “knotter” (Akkadian kashu) or the “untangler” (Akkadian pâtaru) of nefarious or beneficial charms, respectively, both of which are symbolised by knots (Amiet, 1961, rev and repr 1980, p 116) The apotropaic function of the knot is a recurrent phenomenon in many countries and periods Cf Kitzinger, 1970, p 642 and n 21 2 Cf Wellhausen, 1897, p 161 A scholium on a sermon of the fourth-century archbishop of Constantinople, Gregory of Nazianze, defines incantations (epasmata) with the words:
The chants sung over young children by [ ] old women, muttering to avert evil, and at the same time licking the babes’ foreheads with their tongues and spitting, blowing to each side

the illness and the Prophet sent ʿAlī to read the two sūras At each verse (āyaʿalāʾiyya) a knot was untied and the Prophet was cured 11 His third and favourite wife ʿĀʾisha is recorded as saying:
As soon as he recited the Qurʾân over one of these knots into which a spell against him had been placed, that particular knot became untied 12
The Basran Muslim mystic, Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Ḥārith al-Muḥāsibī (d 243/857), said that God helps the man who persists in his wrongdoing and is in need of something “which unties in his heart the knots of persistence in evil, in such a way that he may return to his Lord in repentance of his offence ”13 In Muslim religious science the act of loosing or untying a knot is considered the resolving of a difficulty (ḥulūl) which in Hellenistic philosophy denotes the inherent accident in an object as well as the substantial union of soul and body 14 This is also noticeable in the custom that the garments of pilgrims conducting the ḥajj must be knotless, which is in accordance with the widespread belief that those who officiate at either religious or magical ceremonies should have no knots on their person 15 Describing a magical act directed against an enemy, the historian and jurist Abū Zayd ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Walī al-Dīn al-Ḥaḍramī, known as Ibn Khaldūn (732/1332–784/1382), recounts how the magician created an image of the intended victim and then began to pronounce the spell:
during the repeated pronunciation of the evil words he collected spittle in his mouth and spat upon (the picture) Then he tied a knot over the symbol in an object that he had prepared for this purpose since he considered tying knots and (making things) stick together to be auspicious (and effective in magical operations) In this manner the magician can inflict upon his victim what he had intended 16
Contrarily, knots were also designed to protect from harm, and served to safeguard health and love relations 17 Release from binding spells, ḥall al-maʿqūd (“unbinding the tied”), is one of the stated uses of early magic-medicinal bowls The word maʿqūd means one who is bound with knots, a commonly used term for a person on whom a spell has been cast The knot is allegorically referred to in the Qurʾān, when Mūsā implores God to loosen a knot from his tongue (sūra 20, 27) The nightly recitations of the Qurʾān (tahajjud) are said to be justified on the basis that it loosens one of the knots which Satan ties in the hair of a sleeper (sūra 17, 81) 18 It is notable that the same concept existed in the Turkic culture where the concept “magic” is also expressed in “bond, fetters” (bag) 19 A magical association with knotting is also made in one of the earliest prose romances in Persian, the Kitāb-i Samak ʿAyyār, in which the magicians who are captured may be bound by a rope only if the binder knows the special types of knots and the appropriate manner of fastening them 20 More mundane are the allegorical associations made by the Rūm Saljuq chronicler Ibn Bībī in his al-Awāmir al-ʿAlāʾiyya fī ’l-ūmur al-ʿAlāʾiyya, who writes that in spite of the waning fortunes of the empire:
it occurred to no one that the knot of this empire could dissolve and that the sun of this fortune could set 21
For the successful conclusion of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān ʿIzz al-Dīn Kay Kāwūs’s marriage preparations he elaborates upon the commonly used metaphor “to tie the marriage knot” (ʿaqdi zanāshūʾī bastan)22 in the following manner:
...when the knot of the agreement was tightened and the rope of the bond gained firmness 23

The allegory of the knotted dragon tail is used by the early thirteenth-century secretary in the administration of Jamāl al-Dīn Ay Ana Ulugh Bārbak,24 Abu ’l-Sharaf Nāṣiḥ Jarbādhqānī, who records that:
Abu ’l-Ḥasan was commanded to Sistan and with cunning, boldness and skill to bring success to this travail, which had become knotted as the Dragon’s tail ... to free the troops from the straits of exile, the locks and bolts of affliction25
hence alluding to these military difficulties as “knots” in the dragon’s tail It should be remarked in this connection that the use of knots as apotropaic devices perpetuates earlier practice seen in the architecture of the early Islamic period 26 It is significant that these were also placed in or near thresholds The desert residence of Khirbat al-Mafjar, possibly built by the eighth-century Umayyad prince and later caliph al-Walīd ibn yazīd,27 for instance, had specially designed mosaics with magic knot designs placed on the thresholds to ensure the magical entrapment of any evil force trying to enter the throne hall (dīwān) 28 Similar knot designs were employed in contemporary churches of Syria and Palestine suggesting that the apotropaic associations of ancient times were incorporated into Christian concepts as well 29 The knotting aspect can also be observed in Islamic epigraphy on portable objects, for instance on the Bobrinski bucket, dated 559/1163 Circumscribing the body at mid-section is an epigraphic frieze with a benedictory content which has constantly repeated knotted hastae (fig 34) In addition to their decorative function, the reduplication of potent signs such as complex knotted forms, in this case mainly of a quadripartite configuration, together with the reiteration of let
ters (an important part of magical practice), was presumably intended to intensify their beneficial effect by invoking the concept of a continuous, endless protection 30 To this may be added the definition given by the fourteenth-century Ottoman theologian and biographer, ʿIṣām al-Dīn Ṭashköprüzāde, of the Arabic word ṭilasm, or talisman, as “indissoluble knot ”31
b The knotted dragon
It has been suggested that the motif of entwined dragons with necks or bodies interlaced to form a single loop, occasionally a knot, consistently employed in medieval Islamic architecture on gates and portals, is subject to different interpretations 32 Guitty Azarpay more clearly specifies that:
the theme of the entwined dragons finds Central Asian forerunners that doubtless contributed to the widespread use of the motif in Islamic art patronized by Turkish dynasties 33
This is illustrated on memorial steles, a celebrated example being the early eighth-century entwined dragons that crown the stele of the Turkic commander-in-chief Köl Tigin, inscribed with a bilingual text in Chinese and Turkic, in Chöshöö Cajdam in Mongolia (fig 165) 34 Together with the memorial complex the stele was built in 731 with the help of Chinese palace artists sent by the Chinese emperor Xuanzong (r 712–756) The Chinese artists worked under Turkic instructions overseen by Köl Tigin’s older brother Bilgä Qaghan (d 734), hence one may surmise that the iconographies figured in the memorial stele were intended, in accordance with Turkic cosmogonic and cosmological beliefs, to smooth the way of the deceased into the afterlife 35 The stele was

originally erected on the back of a pedestal in the form of a turtle, which was found nearby The front of the stele oriented towards sunrise bears an inscription in runic Turkic script, whereas the back of the monument is inscribed in Chinese characters with the condolences sent by the Tang emperor Another example is offered by a fragmentary monumental stone memorial stele carved with the arched body of a quadruped dragon (which formed the left side of an entwined pair of dragons) of the eighth Uighur qaghan (r 808821) at the Uighur capital Qarabalghasun (Ordu Balïq), to the south of the palace remains, in the Ötükän region of Mongolia (fig 166) The dragon head is rendered with foreshortened snout ending in a tightly curled tip, holding a round object, perhaps a pearl, in its open jaws and with a thick curly beard at the lower jaw, extending into a prominently protruding forehead with bulging eyes and large, cusped ears swept to the back The latter touch upon an X-shaped motif enlivened with small roundels in the interstitial areas that embellish the dragon’s neck, while the scaled muscular body is slightly awkwardly arranged with large projecting extremities terminating in unsheathed claws The fragment almost certainly formed one side of an interlaced pair of dragons that once crowned a colossal memorial stele inscribed, as surviving fragments reveal, with a trilingual text in Chinese, Uighur and Sogdian The doubling aspect of the interlaced dragons has already been touched upon in preceding chapters The pairing of the dragons, aimed at buttressing and doubling the visual impact, was a noticeable feature that may have served to augment the intended effect of the potent symbol This may moreover be associated with the inherently ambivalent aspect of the
dragon in ancient Turkish cosmology which saw the creature living underground in winter then re-appearing in the spring and soaring into the sky in the summer where it reigned at the zenith as a divine creature 36 The association of the Turks with the dragon is further corroborated by ethnogonic myths of different Turkic tribes which are characteristic of Central Asian founder myths and legends of origin (for instance, the mythic formulae of the origins of the ancient Scythian-Saka),37 such as the tale of the origin of the Kimeks, recorded in the eleventh-century account of the Ghaznawid historian Abū Saʿīd ʿAbd al-Ḥayy Gardīzī 38 The legend recounts how Shad, the ruler and “founder” of the Kimeks:
...one day heard a voice coming from the water as he stood on the banks of the Irtysh; the voice said, Shad, give me your hand in the water Shad, seeing only some hair floating on the surface of the water, tethered his horse and entered the water; he grasped the hair, which turned out to belong to his wife-to-be, Khatun, and upon enquiring, he learned that she had been seized from the riverbank by a water dragon 39
The Kimek founder myth not only affirms the sacredness of the river Irtysh in Siberia to the Turkic tribe but also involves the motif of an ancestress that had been snatched by an aquatic dragon Also noteworthy is the account given by the Armenian historian Mattʿēos Uṛ hayetsi (d 1142) of the Qun migration in the mid-eleventh century, in which he mentions the “People of the Serpents” that attack the Pale Ones (khartēshkʿ = Cumans) 40 To this may be added the story of a Qıpchaq chieftain, Tugorkan, recounted in Rus’

literary tradition (byliny), who carries the patronymic “Tugarin Zmeevich” (“the son of the serpent-dragon”) 41 While it may not be possible to trace the chain of transmission of the interlaced dragons, they are considered to be variations in the context of a possible sensus communis However, not only are the dragons portrayed as pairs with necks or bodies entwined to form a single central loop, but occasionally their own bodies incorporate a knot at mid-section The shape of the knot varies, though it is often quadripartite in form yet before discussing the motif in the Western Central Asian region it is interesting to note that the iconography of dragons joined by means of a quadripartite knot also makes an appearance in a Buddhist context in the art of eastern Turkestan Depictions appear in the wall paintings of cave monasteries in Shorchuk, dated between the sixth and the eighth century, and Bezeklik in Qocho (Chinese Gaochang, the former capital of the western Uighur kingdom, Dakianusšhahri, located c 30 km east of present-day Turfan), which has been dated to the late tenth century 42 The Shorchuk wall painting shows donors facing confronted dragons knotted at mid-section in a similar manner (fig 167) An analogous composition of knotted dragons is portrayed on a now destroyed wall painting from Bezeklik which survives only in a drawing by the German archaeologist Albert Grünwedel made during the third German expedition to Chinese Turkestan in 1906 to 1907 The drawing shows a pair of superimposed vegetal stems each terminating in a blossom growing out of a water pool At the point of juncture, a pair of addorsed Chinese-derived dragons project horizontally, their hind limbs entwined to form a central quadripartite knot, while the upper blossom forms the seat of Padmapāṇi, the Bodhisattva of Compassion (fig 168) The painting displays a fusion of Buddhist and Manichaean elements which evolved under Uighur patronage in the late tenth century The fact that it was
executed under Uighur patronage adds further weight to the possibility that the interlaced dragon figure was introduced into Islamic art from Central Asia via the Turkic dynasties 43 It is significant in this regard that some of the earliest extant examples of the quadripartite knot in Islamic art seem to appear in the wider Khurasan region A key document, the starting point for the discussion that follows, is a large, elongated copper alloy matrix with cusped arch terminals, distinguished by a pair of confronted dragons in mirror image whose scaly bodies form a central quadripartite interlacing knot (fig 169) 44 Both arch-shaped ends are filled with the protomes of the paired confronted dragons The latter have rounded heads with wide-open snouts showing finely demarcated flews and inward-curled tips and revealing projecting tongues that touch at the centre Their elongated twisted horns with upward-curling tips curve towards the back above the slender cusped ears The heads are separated from the curving bodies by a finely moulded “collar ” Their angled ribbed front legs with rounded feet nearly touch at the tips The serpentine bodies of the four dragons form a large, central quadripartite knot that is enlivened at the centre by a small quatrefoil with elongated lozenge-shaped petals which may represent a stellar emblem This matrix, now in the al-Sabāh Collection, Kuwait National Museum, is part of a set of 77 copper alloy matrices for belt/strap fittings, one of which bears an inscription in the name of Muḥammad ibn Sām above the figure of a lion 45 As discussed earlier, the inscription connects the set directly with the Ghurid sulṭān Ghiyāth al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Sām or his younger brother, Muʿizz al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Sām This set of matrices could thus have appertained to either one, or both, of the brothers, although Ghiyāth al-Dīn clearly remained the elder statesman 46 The set was, moreover, reportedly found near the

first–third centuries) who ruled over the region which comprises what is now Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India,55 as well as by the Armenians of a province near Lake Sevan 56 According to the genealogy of the Sām dynasty of Ghūr, the fourth caliph ʿAlī brought about the conversion of the family to Islam in the first century of the Islamic era, granting them the rulership of Ghūr 57 The knot that joins the two dragons is the socalled “knot of Solomon,” which was known in the Central Asian region from at least the first centuries ad through to the Islamic period This knot succeeded the ancient so-called Herakles/Hercules knot, the most famous knot used in ancient times, considered to have apotropaic and magical qualities, which was often depicted in the form of both ophidian and quadruped dragons,58 and is a compelling example of continuity of meaning in spite of formal change The symbolism of the Herakles knot still had currency in late seventh- or early eighth-century Sogdia Moulded in the form of a pair of upright dragons that are linked by means of a large Herakles knot, the motif appears in a non-Buddhist context in the monumental sculptural decoration on the plastered mud-brick architecture of the portico of Temple II in the ancient city of Panjikent in Sogdiana (Zarafashān, north of the Hiṣār range) (fig 170) Like the Hercules knot, the knot of Solomon is a well-known apotropaic sign 59 It is commonly associated with the magical seal of Solomon (khātam Sulaymān)60 and attributed to the magician-king Solomon of post-biblical Jewish tradition61 who controls the winds, animals, and spirits The biblical King Sulaymān is named

seventeen times in the Qurʾān (especially sūra 38, 30–9) 62 The khātam Sulaymān is thought to have been the symbol inscribed on the seal ring of Sulaymān, “which endowed his owner with power over both terrestrial and supernatural beings ”63 Melikian-Chirvani, moreover, has drawn attention to the possibility that the presence of the motif, which is “typical of the Eastern Iranian repertoire [on metalwork] seldom used in the West,”64 indicates an esoteric intention 65 The motif of the knotted dragons, rendered in virtually the same manner as on the Ghurid matrix, is pictured on a “sphero-conical” unglazed earthenware vessel found in the region of the Golden Horde (Juchi Ulus), datable to the late twelfth or early thirteenth century, now preserved in the State Historical Museum in Moscow (fig 171) The dragons are more stylised, however, and have lost their horns and forelegs, so that only their necks are shown to cross over A great quantity of these “sphero-conical” vessels have been found throughout the Islamic world, and while the vessels probably served numerous different purposes,66 the prevalent view is that they contained liquids such as beverages,67 mercury or perfume,68 while some may have been used for chemical or alchemical operations 69 Several “sphero-conical” vessels with the same motif have been found, such as a bottle fragment from Dwīn in Ararat province, the former Armenian capital until the Arab conquest when it became the seat of the governor,70 an example from Iran, now in the collection of Michael Rogers, London,71 with stamped decoration and a large six-pointed star
(a motif also associated with the magical khātam Sulaymān) as well as another unprovenanced example from a private collection 72 A moulded band with eight almond-shaped medallions enclosing pairs of knotted dragons circumscribes a pyriform flask of unglazed earthenware, thought to come from Iran or Mesopotamia, which is datable to the same period, now in the Musée national de la céramique, Sèvres 73 Here the winged dragons are pictured addorsed The heads, jaws agape, are twisted back so that their outstretched tongues meet at the centre while their forelegs are turned outwards and the bodies are linked by means of a quadripartite knot Like most of the “sphero-conical” vessels, the body of the flask is made of dense almost stoneware-like high-temperature fired earthenware, which makes the vessel watertight The specificity of the paste and the esoteric connotation of the motifs evoke alchemical procedures which were practised by great physicians such as Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyāʾ al-Rāzī (the Rhazes of the Latin Middle Ages) from Rayy in Iran (c. 250/854–313/925 or 323/935), whose interest lay particularly in practical chemistry,74 and suggest the use of the flask in a laboratory context 75 In the symbolism of medieval Islamic alchemy, it seems the paired dragons connected with the use of a quadripartite knot represented a fundamental polarity on which the cosmic rhythm is based, the solve et coagula of the alchemical process: the sulphur and mercury of alchemy 76 This complex theory was developed in the writings of the Jābirian Corpus, Muḥammad ibn Umayl

al-Ṣādiq al-Tamīmī, and also the Turba Philosophorum
In the Kitāb al-Fihrist, a work composed in Baghdad at the end of the tenth century, Abu ’l-Faraj Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq ibn al-Nadīm (d 385/995 or 388/998) credits the Umayyad prince Khālid ibn yazīd (d c 704/85) as the first Arab to have been interested in alchemy and to have ordered translations of some alchemical works 77 By the middle of the tenth century various philosophical currents circulated in Baghdad, which also included the magical and alchemical thought-world of the writings of the Jabirian cycle 78 In the writings of the Jabirian corpus of alchemy, the idea of a transmutational elixir (aliksir) used as medicine or life-giving force, which was probably transmitted from China,79 occurs for the first time It could be prepared from animal, vegetal or mineral substances and could be used to prolong life or given as medicine to sick people As already mentioned in the preceding chapter, Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (d c 196/812), purportedly an alchemist at the court of Hārūn al-Rashīd, believed all metals to be a result of their union in different proportions and according to different modalities Under the influences of the planets, these are formed in the heart of the earth by the union of the hypothetical substances of sulphur, male, in which fire and air are present and which has hot and dry “natures,” and mercury, female, which contains water and earth, and is cold and wet 80 Astrological components may also inform the iconographic rendering In Abū Maslama Muḥammad al-Majrītī’s magical treatise Ghāyat al-ḥakīm the opposing principles of positive and negative bodily temperaments are associated with the two celestial nodes (knots), the head and the tail of the “hidden essence [“verborgenem Wesen”] ”81 As mentioned earlier, al-Bīrūnī reports that the nodes have separate natures, the head of the
dragon being hot, auspicious and indicating increase of wealth and the tail being cold, bringing misfortune and signifying diminution of wealth 82 He also notes that:
some people say that the dragon’s head is male and diurnal and the tail female and nocturnal 83
It is further of note, as recorded by al-Damīrī in his bestiary, that in medieval Islam it was a popular belief that “serpents do not copulate in the usually known manner of copulation, but they twist themselves round each other (for that purpose) ”84 A sexual character of the knotted dragon motif is further supported by the universal sympathy, discussed earlier, that ultimately unites all natural opposing forces, including those of the female and the male principle, which also finds expression in the coupling of the Sun and the Moon The use of the twisted serpents’ motif as a simile for sexual intercourse appears in Gurgānī’s poem Wīs u Rāmīn which in its essence is a celebration of an erotic relationship 85 However, whereas the theme of the twisted serpents was frequently associated with sexual symbolism in pre-Islamic written sources,86 it is a relatively rare occurrence in medieval Islam Exactly the same motif as shown on the Sèvres pyriform flask is recorded on a contemporary unglazed clay jug with filter from northern Syria, in the National Museum in Damascus The vessel carries around the body a similar moulded band with contiguous almond-shaped medallions enclosing the same knotted dragons (fig 172) A similar depiction, but with the dragon heads in addorsed position, is found on a shallow ceramic bowl from Raqqa of the same period, now preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New york (fig 173) 87

Then there is the ‘Lion Seal’ which is also called the pebble seal On a steel thimble, the sorcerer engraves the picture of a lion dragging its tail and biting on pebbles which is thus divided into two parts A snake is represented in front of the lion It is coiled at the feline’s mouth Upon the lion’s back, a crawling scorpion is represented In order to make the engraving, (the sorcerer) waits for a time when the sun enters the first or third decan of Leo, provided (further) that the two luminaries (the sun and the moon) are well and out of
their misfortune ... People assume that the person who holds onto it (the charm) has an indescribable power over rulers and is able to have close contact with them, to serve them, and to use them for his own ends...
Tr Rosenthal, 1958, vol 3, p 163 The same motif is mentioned in the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm (“The Philosopher’s Goal”), attributed to Abū Maslama Muḥammad al-Majrītī The serpent-lion-scorpion motif was current in the Islamic east in the early Islamic period A depiction of just the lion and scorpion, without the serpent, appears on the obverse of two circular pendants from the Nīshāpūr excavation of the Iranian expedition of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1936 to 1947) Cf Jenkins and Keene, 1982, cat no 7a and b; Allan, 1982b, pp 68–9, cat nos 60, 61 92 Ittig, 1982, p 81 93 The same “decorative programme” is given also on five other “magic bowls” that were examined by Annette Ittig (1982), but the knotted dragon figures on only one of these bowls While Ittig suggests that the inscriptions may therefore not necessarily be directly related to the motif of the knotted dragons, the depiction certainly cannot be antithetical to the content of the inscriptions and may belong to a body of magico-talismanic symbols used for related purposes that do not necessarily have to concur 94 The use of talismans in the region of Mosul that are written in ink and washed off with water which is then given as a potion to a person who has been bitten by a serpent, scorpion or mad dog, is described by Thompson, 1907, p 327
An esoteric character of this dragon knot is suggested by its appearance on a hemispherical copper alloy magico-medicinal bowl, preserved in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, which has been dated between the twelfth and fourteenth century 88 The interior of the bowl features a pair of knotted confronted dragons with paired slender sinuous tails, an undulating serpent, an eight-legged scorpion and a quadruped, probably a lion 89 The dragons are characterised by “Saljuqtype” fanged jaws with the conspicuous feature that their tongues are darting out to meet at the centre (fig 174) The interesting serpent-lionscorpion combination is mentioned in Aḥmad ibn ʿAlī al-Būnī’s (d c 622/1225) widely circulated thirteenth-century writings on magic 90 It also occurs on Islamic talismans such as the “Lion Seal” described by Ibn Khaldūn 91 The bowl is circumscribed on the exterior in cursive script with a therapeutic inscription which reads:
This holy bowl is useful for the sting of a scorpion and of a snake and the bite of a mad dog, for difficulty in childbirth, nosebleed, stomach ache and colic The afflicted person is to drink from it three times By the grace of god he will recover For difficult labour drink saffron water For stopping nosebleed and abdominal pain, snuff water from it For colic, gulp down hot water This has been proven by experience The work of
Muhammad ibn yūnus – may God have mercy on him 92
In addition it is inscribed with Qurʾānic verses (comprising sūras 84, 1–4; 71, 18; and 94, 5–6), further invocations asking relief from labour pains and colic (requesting the help of four genii) as well as a series of nine letters that form the initial part of a different sūra (hence are endowed with a special “sympathetic quality,” or khawāṣṣ) It is significant that although the decorative programme and the inscription suggest that talismanic power was invested in this bowl, the inscription does not attribute this power directly to a planetary representation, but instead emphasises the curative properties of the bowl The therapeutic efficacy for an ailing person to drink from a bowl that is inscribed with Qurʾānic verses and formulae of blessing is well-known It may be presumed that just as the medicinal effect derives its power from the contact of water with a vessel inscribed with pious inscriptions and magical invocations, the symbolism of the three animals, the quadruped, the snake and the scorpion, as well as the knotted dragons on this magico-medicinal bowl93 serve a similar function through the agency of water The charging of water with magico-medicinal healing through material contact with a magical object or talisman94 is also illustrated, for instance, in the magical manual of the Pseudo-Majrīṭī, Kitāb

and tongues (the lower head is less legible on account of the deteriorated condition but may be presumed to mirror the upper head) 97 In his discussion of the Çankırı darüşşifa knotted double dragon motif Gabriel drew attention some time ago to the reminiscence of the ancient Asklepian symbol (consisting of a single serpent coiled around a staff) 98 It is also of note that in some thirteenth-century star pictures the constellation Ophiūchus (Serpentarius), the “serpentholder,”99 is rendered knotted in such a way as to appear almost double 100 This is of special importance for the interpretation of the iconography of the knotted dragons, taking into account that in classical antiquity Ophiūchus was also referred to as Asklepios, the god of medicine par excellence, whose attribute is a pair of intertwined serpents, and as Hygieia, his mythical daughter 101 The constellation Ophiūchus governed physicians and pharmacologists as well as huntsmen and athletes



the dragon and the magico-medical sphere 169
a The dragon as prophylaxis and cure
In Iranian mythology Thrita/Trita was the first of the healers He “drove back sickness to sickness, drove back death to death; he asked for an antidote (and) obtained it from Khshthra-Vairya to withstand sickness and to counter-act snakebite” (Vidēvdāt 20 2–3)
1
Thrita, “the third man who pressed the Haoma” (yasna 9 10), appears originally to have been closely associated (if not identical) with Thraētaona,
2
for the invention of the miraculous gift of healing, in other words the granting of health, strength, fertility and fecundity, was also attributed to the latter
3
In the Farvardīn yasht Thraētaona had the ability to cure certain illnesses and could:
counteract pain, hot fever, humours, cold fever and incontinence, and [...] the pain caused by the serpent
4
Knowledge of the secret causes of illness and the no less secret measures necessary to obtain a cure belonged to the duties of the healer Accordingly, Thraētaona was also regarded as the inventor of magic
5
In living Zoroastrian observance it is
Thraētaona who is invoked, as king Frēdōn/ Farīdūn, in prayers and on amulets to keep away or cure sickness
6
The tenth-century philologist Ḥamza al-Iṣfahānī also records that Farīdūn “constructed amulets, and introduced the antidote (made) from the body of vipers, and founded medicine, and pointed out those extracts of herbs which keep away pestilence from the bodies of animate beings ”
7
Manichaean Middle Persian prayer and incantation texts reciting “names of power” frequently mention the “First Physician” prydwn (Frēdūn) in connection with other powerful names known in a magical context, such as Gabriel and “Sabaoth ”
8
The parallels in the magical healing abilities of both Thrita and Thraētaona are mirrored by their heroic feats Both are known to have overcome serpent-bodied, three-headed and six-eyed dragons, respectively known as Viśvarūpa and Azhi Dahāka, the difference being that the former is a celestial and the latter a terrestrial dragon
9
It is interesting to observe that the magical healers who are called upon to cure injuries caused by snake bites and to invent an antidote for snake venom are at the same time dragon fighters par

When Thraētaona, on his march to Bawri, the capital of Aži [ ], arrived at the Tigris (the Rangha); an angel then came and taught him magic to enable him to baffle the sortileges of Aži (Shāh-nāma) We have in this passage an instance of his talents as a wizard, and one which helps us to understand why Thraētaona is considered as the inventor of magic, and his name is invoked in spells and incantations

Can you know the efficacy of all herbs, or the benefit coming from every animal? Already even from poisonous vipers have come antidotes for the safety of humans But you will say, “The snake is terrible ” Fear the Lord and he [that is to say, the snake] will not be able to harm you

excellence 10 Another analogy between the two healer-heroes is provided in the Avesta which relates that the second mortal to press liquid haoma (Ved sóma) was Āthwya, for which he received the boon of fathering Thraētaona, and the third haoma-presser was Thrita 11 The sacred haoma plant was regarded as chief of medicinal herbs 12 The drink, made of the haoma seed, intoxicated, gave heightened divine powers and mantic wisdom,13 and was used to counter the dragon “who tosses poison around ”14 Further manifestations of the dragon in the realm of prophylaxis and cure are found in epic narratives 15 In Asadī Ṭūsī’s heroic Garshāspnāma,16 Ẓaḥḥāk (the historicised mythological foreign usurper and avatar of the Avestan demon Azhi Dahāka) requests the legendary hero Garshāsp to vanquish a dragon that comes out of the sea and lives on Mount Shekāwand in Kābul 17 Before setting out to fight the dragon, Garshāsp took an antidote/theriac (diryāq), a kind of universal drug which often contained the flesh of serpents (see the discussion in the following section) He finally succeeded in killing the beast with a club carved in the form of a dragon head 18 By slaying the dragon with a weapon carved with his own likeness, the hero thus once again applied the homeopathic (or imitative) principle of similia similibus curantur After the victory Garshāsp is said to have shed his skin and lost
consciousness Hence as a result of his triumph over his mighty foe he assimilated some of his adversary’s positive ophidian characteristics, such as the shedding of the skin, an act that is symbolic of long or eternal life Thus when the hero regained consciousness, he gave thanks to an angel The dragon’s carcass was transported to the city where Garshāsp’s feat was celebrated and he was honoured as jahān-pahlavān (chief hero), a term closely associated with the Iranian heroic tradition The event was commemorated in a flag embellished with the representation of a black dragon and a pole surmounted by a golden lion in turn topped by a moon 19 This was passed on to Garshāsp’s descendants and became his family’s coat of arms,20 another allegorical example which suggests that the formidable qualities of the dragon were appropriated by the vanquisher Doses of diryāq against the dragon’s poison were also taken by Rustam’s son, Farāmarz, and his helper, Bīzhan, before they slew the hissing dragon that lived on the summit of a mountain in India 21 Similarly, the legendary hero Borzū, the son of Sohrāb, resorted to drinking diryāq and milk as an antidote to the dragon’s venom before entering his lair on Mount Zahāb to slay him 22 The ancient association of the serpent with the art of healing23 appears also in the popular tale of the serpent that introduced the healing herb,

b The dragon and the theriaca as illustrated in the Kitāb al-diryāq
From earliest times the serpent-dragon was associated with poisons as well as antidotes In different forms snake flesh and other ophidian elements were used as remedies for various kinds of ailment Among the earliest extant illustrated Islamic manuscripts are two copies of an Arabic text on antidotes derived from snakes and used as a remedy for snake venom 26 As mentioned in its title, the Kitāb al-diryāq (“Book of the Theriac”) concerns the preparation of the theriac (a derivative of the Greek thēriakos), a medicinal remedy
celebrated in antiquity that was considered efficacious against the poison of snakebites or the bites of other wild beasts (from ther, “wild animal”)27 dealing with the effects of snakebites The earlier of the two copies, dated 595/1199, in the collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, since 1853,28 has a double frontispiece 29 The doubling of the near-identical pages, once again, serves to increase and underpin the intended effect, underlining the double potency of the symbolism of the paired images The pages depict two seated figures each holding up large crescents with two diminutive attendants in princely dress on either side, each enclosed by two confronted dragons and four framing figures that are equally splendidly clad (fig 176) 30 Flanking the central section of both miniatures horizontally at top and bottom are epigraphic bands in Kufic which read: “Its owner and scribe is the meekest of God’s servants, be He praised, Muḥammad, son of the fortunate Abu ’l-Fatḥ, son of the rightly guided imām, Abu ’l-Ḥasan, son of the beneficent imām ”31 A second double page composition carrying an inscription on the right side states that the book was made for the library of a certain imām Abu ’l-Fatḥ Maḥmūd,32 possibly a nephew of the owner/scribe named on the frontispiece, and apparently a member of the Shīʿī religious class 33 Unfortunately the place of production is not stated The paintings of the manuscript have been attributed to Iran, but most scholars concur that they originate in the north Mesopotamian (Jazīran) school of Mosul 34 The haloed and crowned female figure on the two miniatures, richly clad and bejewelled, her plaited hair falling over her shoulders, is seated with folded legs and crossed feet One of the soles faces upwards showing the tips of the hennatinted toes, while the uplifted hands with henna

tinted fingertips hold a large crescent-shaped moon The centrally facing figure is flanked on either side by two small attendants 35 The composition is encircled by two confronted dragons whose bodies are knotted at the four cardinal points; at the top the heads, with curved horns, wrinkled snouts and wide-open jaws revealing tongues with bifid tips, extend beyond the circumference, while the slender coiling tails form an additional loop before tapering to a point at the base The corners of the composition are filled with four winged figures, of presumably honorific and celestial significance,36 that hold up the medallion The central figures and the four framing figures are distinguished by a halo The central frontally rendered figure, possibly a symbolic personification of the planet Moon (al-qamar), was a popular motif at this time37 and one that was “generally invested with astrological and semi-magical significance ”38 The now destroyed thirteenth-century Sinjār Gate of Mosul was decorated with a relief portraying a figure holding up a crescent moon 39 The emblem appears to have been of some importance since it is shown on the coinage of Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ as well as on coins of other rulers of Mosul and Sinjār (between 585 and 657/1189 and 1258) and of Saladin (Mayyāfāriqīn, 587/1191) 40 In his monograph on the manuscript, Bishr Farès perceives the lunar emblem as Nin-gal, the “Great Lady” and divine consort of the moon-god Sīn, whose attribute was the crescent, and proposes that the iconographic expression was trans
mitted through the Ṣābian cult of the moon-god at Ḥarrān41 whose cult flourished well into the Islamic period Farès associates the lunar figure with the content of the text, which he construed to be a prophylactic or talismanic device reinforced by healing powers associated with serpents against the evil powers of disease in ancient Mesopotamian and Graeco-Roman beliefs 42 The iconography of the Pseudo-Galen double miniature has been studied by Guitty Azarpay, who identified the depiction of the dragons juxtaposed with the anthropomorphic lunar emblem as eclipse dragons, the head and the tail of aljawzahar 43 This argument is strengthened by the fact that a partial solar eclipse did occur in the Near East on 29 Rabīʿ al-awwal 595/28 January 1199, a date which corresponds with that of the completion of the manuscript, indicating that the representations on the double miniature were intended as apotropaic devices against the potential astrological threats imminent at the very time of its production 44 yet rather than associating the imagery of al-jawzahar, portrayed with the personified moon emblem, with the actual occurrence of a solar or lunar eclipse, Pancaroğlu suggests, as proposed earlier by Farès, that the depiction has in fact a wider meaning and, more precisely, may also be semantically linked with the contents of the manuscript 45 Although probably being a pseudo-epigraphical original Arabic work by an anonymous author, the text of the Kitāb al-diryāq is falsely attributed

Alternatively, the entwined coils may represent the caduceus-like staff, a symbol that was known in the medieval Islamic world Writing in the thirteenth century, the physician Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (599/1203–669/1270) records in his dictionary of over 380 biographies of physicians, ʿUyūn al-anbāʾ fī ṭabaqāt al-aṭibbāʾ
(“Sources of Information on the Generations of Physicians”), that according to Galen’s account:
Asklepios is represented holding in his hand a carved staff with branches, made from the marsh mallow tree ... Upon it, there is represented a long-lived animal, wound [i e , coiled] around it – a snake 51
He explains that the association of Asklepios with the serpent is due, firstly, to:
the fact that the snake is a sharp-sighted animal which is much awake and never sleeps Thus the student of the craft of medicine must not be detracted by sleep, and he must possess the keenest possible mind in order to be able to warn (his patients) in advance of present (conditions) and (those) likely to arise in the future 52
He offers a further explanation, namely that the serpent has a long lifespan, perhaps possessing eternal life and hence that:
those who employ the craft of medicine are able to live long ... This animal – the snake – sloughs off its skin, called by the Greeks “old age ” Likewise people by employing the craft of medicine, are able to slough off old age, the result of disease and regain health 53
Other medieval Arabic sources record that Asklepios’ staff was wreathed with entwined serpents and, moreover, that Agathodaimon (Aghāthūdhīmūn), who was considered a great authority in the occult sciences, was Asklepios’ teacher 54 In spite of their dangerous or even life-threatening qualities, serpents have long been considered to have medicinal benefits against a variety of afflictions and, as stated in the account of Andromachus the younger included in the text of the Kitāb al-diryāq, were an essential ingredient in the theriac, into which he “added many drugs and made a single theriac ...

55 Kerner, 2004, pp 232–3 The practice of consuming snake meat to cure a variety of illnesses has a very long history The first-century medical writer Cornelius Celsus (d c 50 ad) reports the experience of farmers who cured abscesses in the lymphatic glands by eating snake flesh (De medicina 5 28 7b); cf Hanson, 2006, p 497 The ingredient was formalised when the Roman emperor Nero (r 54–68 ad) developed an interest in an antidote formulated by Mithridates VI (120–163 bc), king of Pontus, for which a Persian physician had probably supplied the recipe and which the king used daily as a preventive measure against poisoning He asked his “Leibarzt,” Andromachus the Elder, to investigate and improve the compound, which subsequently was modified by the addition of snake flesh as a further ingredient, thus creating what is generally regarded as the first true theriac, the Theriaca Andromachi, being an early example of the homeopathic principle of similia similibus curantur (Bierman, 1994, p 5) Thereafter, the use of snake flesh as a cure is recorded by numerous physicians, such as Aretaios and Galen (Oberhelman, 1994, p 943 and n 9) It is also reported in the writings of Eznik of Koghb (Elc alandocʿ, tr and ed Mariès and Mercier, 1959, pp 574–5, ch 64) Moreover, it is known that the ingredient was used by Jewish physicians of the medieval period when they produced the universal drug:

mixed into the theriac the flesh of snakes ”55 Three anecdotes attributed to Andromachus the younger serve to substantiate the therapeutic properties of snake flesh These comprise the use of snakes dissolved in wine, a mixture reported to have cured a man suffering from leprosy (known as elephantitis),56 the homeopathic effect of snakes dissolved in water upon a snakebite, and similarly a snakebite serving as an antidote against an opium overdose 57 The fourteenth-century scholar al-Damīrī records in his well-known bestiary that “it is unlawful to eat serpents on account of their injurious property, and an antidote prepared out of their flesh is also unlawful ” He based this on the tenth-century traditionist and Shāfʿī specialist Abū Bakr al-Bayhaqī, remarking that it is forbidden by the Shāfʿī school, “excepting in circumstances of great necessity ”58 In spite of these cautionary remarks snakes apparently continued to be a choice ingredient in the theriac or other concoctions, as evidenced also by the same scholar who cites that according to ʿĪsā ibn ʿAlī:
The flesh [of snakes] preserves the senses, and soup (gravy) made of its flesh strengthens the sense of sight The flesh of serpents from a part

If the fried slough of a serpent is taken and the bark of the root of capers, long birth-wort (aristolochy), and anacardium in equal parts are mixed with it, and then a person suffering from both external and internal hanging piles is fumigated (with the mixture), they will fall off [ ] if the slough of a serpent mixed with the reddish tinged bdellium both external and internal piles are fumigated, they will be cured If an egg of a serpent is pounded with nitre and vinegar, and then applied over fresh patches of white leprosy, it will remove them [ ] [The serpent’s] heart if it is hung on the body, will cure quartan ague 60

number of vipers,61 since theriac was prepared from their flesh 62 Moreover, the city of Arīhā (Jericho) is named “the home of the theriacal serpents, and the excellence of the theriac of Jerusalem owing to the use therein of the flesh of those serpents” in an addition to a thirteenthcentury manuscript copy of al-Muqaddasī’s geography, Aḥsan al-taqāsīm fī maʿrifat al-aqālīm (“The Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions”), preserved in the Süleymaniye Kütüphanesi, Istanbul 63 In the second extant copy of the Kitāb al-diryāq, in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna, a miniature in the herpetological tract illustrates the procedure of serpent hunting for the flesh of snakes used in the remedy 64 The serpents were made to bite into leather-“dolls” with glass eyes for them to discharge their venom, making them easier to handle 65 The medicinal properties of serpent flesh were also known in Buddhist Central Asia where in the Swāt region Lord Śakra (Indra), an incarnation of the Buddha, sacrificed himself for the good of the people by transforming himself into a great serpent whose dead body filled the entire valley of Swāt Since his flesh was a remedy for every kind of disease, the sick were thus delivered from their afflictions 66 This legend has certain affinities with an assortment of tales related to the Queen of the Serpents which is included in Alf layla wa-layla collection of fairy-tales and other stories 67 In the tale the Serpent-Queen consents
to be slain and to sacrifice her flesh in order to heal the king However just as in Andromachus the younger’s theriac recipe recorded in the Kitāb al-diryāq text, the consumption of snake flesh is seen here specifically as a cure for leprosy with which the king is afflicted 68 In the tale the flesh of the reptile is to be boiled and then served to the leper Moreover drinking the elixir, in other words the broth in which the flesh was cooked (after skimming off the “first scum” or foam which appears in the process of boiling), is said to give access to the fountains of knowledge, as well as various sciences 69 The consumption of snake flesh as an antidote to snake venom is recommended by ʿAlī ibn Waḥshiyya al-Nabaṭī in his ninth-century text on poisons He notes an antidote attributed to a certain Ḥajujā which involves consuming the flesh of a viper (two ounces) cooked together with bread (samīd) and sipping the meat broth 70 The benefits of serpents, in particular the healing properties of snake flesh as general antidote to its venom, is also stated in the tenth-century texts of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ 71
The symbolism of the knots formed by the two dragons on the frontispiece may be related to the number symbolism of four which, as Meisami writes, “is the number by which the categories of nature are subdivided: the four elements, the four humours, and the four seasons ”72 Medieval Islamic medicine, based largely on Greek medicine and natural history, in particular the Galenic

humoral physiology and pathology, was informed by a structure of sympathies The four elementary qualities or natures (ṭabāʾiʿ) (hot, cold, moist and dry) were regarded as the crucial constituents of all things, whether metals, minerals, plants, or animals; these qualities traditionally correspond to other quaternary groupings such as the four Aristotelian elements of earth, fire, air, and water, and to the Hippocratic-Galenic cardinal humours (al-akhlāt) which consisted of phlegm, yellow bile (choler), black bile (melancholy) and blood 73 The eleventh-century historian of the Ghaznawids, Bayhaqī, stresses the importance for man to “understand that he is composed of four elements, which must be maintained in equilibrium ”74 The actions of the poisons in the body were explained as an imbalance (iʿtidāl) of the four humours, or the entire constitution 75 Moreover, as Meisami states, “the four elements and humours (i e , the bases of all creation), when maintained in equilibrium, are symbolised by the image of a square within a circle ”76 Since this text is largely associated with medicinal preparations, Oya Pancaroğlu argues that the four winged figures which surround the central figure may have been intended to symbolise the four elements and their four humoral counterparts which, by extension, may also be reflected in the four knots formed by the two dragons that may be read as a reinforcement of this number symbolism 77 However, since the pillars of Galenic humoral physiology and pathology are linked to worldly existence and its material manifestations, they may also be more closely associated with the motif of the dragons with fourfold knot This motif would lend itself as a more likely association since the representation of the dragon often served to embody the world and its material expressions 78 The poet al-Fāryābī accordingly defines the four senses that bind humans to the world as four dragons:
This human who is the highest of creations Is constantly in the throes of the four dragons [that make up his senses] 79
In a similar vein, in Niẓāmī’s Haft Paykar:
the dragon represents the “sky,” that is, the material world; its four feet the four elements, its seven heads the seven planets 80
It is, moreover, recorded that above the throne of the Ghaznawid sulṭān Masʿūd, who although being ethnically Turkish was deeply imbued with Persian and Islamic courtly traditions:
a gold-plated chain [was] hung from the ceiling of the chamber containing the dais, and came down over the dais where the crown and the throne were The crown was attached to this chain, and there were four bronze figures fashioned in the shape of human beings and mounted on columns which were secured to the throne itself, so that their hands were outstretched and thus held the crown safely 81
Hence, the number of four figures holding up the crown above the throne may be indicative of standard patterns for enthronement scenes that were current in the Central Asian world It may thus be possible to view the four winged figures framing the personification of the Moon that is enclosed within interlaced dragons of the Kitāb al-diryāq as representing the heavenly sphere, while by contrast the serpent-dragon, with its symbolism evoking potent therapeutic talismanic devices directed against the “demons” of illness, is related to the medical sphere
c Studies on the properties of serpent(-dragons) and the effects of their venom
Based largely on late antique forms of Greek medical knowledge with their magical practices and beliefs, medieval Islamic medical science, pharmacology and toxicology likewise maintained a close link between science and supernatural medical paradigms,82 as reflected in the Kitāb al-diryāq 83 Hence supernatural and magical explanations of diseases were often sought However, while magic spells as remedies were usually prohibited they could exceptionally be resorted to in special cases such as snake or scorpion stings 84 The use of both natural (ʿilm sīmiyā) and

90 A large body of this literature probably originated in the city of Ḥarrān (ancient Carrhae) in northwestern Mesopotamia, a major centre of ancient scholarship, in particular in astrology and astronomy (Ullmann, 1972, pp 28993; Massignon, 1950, repr 1981, pp 384–400) During the ʿAbbasid period Ḥarrānian scholars were present in large numbers in Baghdad Many citizens of Ḥarrān, claiming to be Ṣābians, resisted conversion to Islam and the city remained largely pagan until the early eleventh century The Ṣābians, whose liturgical language was Syriac (Chwolsohn, 1856, vol 1,
p 159), provided some of the greatest translators and scientists of Islam In his classic study on the Ṣābians, Daniil Chwolsohn enumerates some thirty Ṣābian scholars comprising astronomers, philosophers, doctors and mathematicians (1856, vol 1, ch 12); al-Battānī al-Ḥarrānī al-Ṣābiʾ, one of the most renowned Arab astronomers, was born before 244/858, probably at Ḥarrān, into a family that formerly professed the Ṣābian religion The theology of the Ḥarrānians, who came to be known as the Ṣābians after a visit by the caliph al-Maʾmun, is Babylonian in origin, and is a complex blend of polytheism, Gnosticism, Mithraism, Hellenistic Neopythagoreanism and perhaps even Indian cultural components in a synthesis catalysed by Hermeticism Cf

supernatural (siḥr) magic which was thereby involved may largely be seen as a reflection of the beliefs and practices current in contemporary society 85 The relationship between pharmacology, toxicology and other occult sciences is evidenced by the attribution of one of the earliest and most complete known works in Arabic on the scientific study of poisons, their detection and actions, and the treatment of the conditions they cause, the Kitāb al-sumūm wa dafʿ maḍārrihā (“Book on Poisons and the Prevention of Their Harm”), to the renowned alchemist Jābir ibn Ḥayyān which was probably written about 900 or earlier 86 Another important text on poisons in Arabic ascribed to ʿAlī ibn Waḥshiyya al-Nabaṭī who lived in the second half of the ninth century similarly exhibits a mixture of science and magic 87 Texts on pharmacology and toxicology, in particular, contained ideas infused with late antique concepts of magic based on the Hermetic notion of a unified cosmos of independent forces 88 The subject of toxicology intersected above all with the Hermetic tradition of late antiquity, formulated in writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistos (including a number of astrological treatises) which had great influence on magical, divinatory and alchemical discourse in the medieval era 89 This body of discourse emphasises the close relationship or cosmic “sympathy” between the divine and the physical world, spirit and matter, between the hidden and the seen, and was aimed at gaining intellectual and spiritual mastery of the cosmos by tapping into supernatural forces 90 An Arabic text ascribed to Hermes Trismegistos on the venom of serpents and other poisonous
creatures, translated and compiled from the Greek most probably in the ninth century and in circulation throughout the medieval period, reveals the association between toxicology and the Hermetic notions of sympathies 91 The belief in a link between the terrestrial and the celestial informed in particular the description of the serpents, their venom and the theriac antidotes, which were systematised in the text according to their correspondence to the twelve constellations of the zodiac and the planets Among the serpents corresponding to the description of the planets is a dark green or black and saffron-coloured serpent which represents the head and tail of the planet of the dragon (al-jawzahr) 92 A list of fantastic serpents follows, among them a deathly red serpent with black wings living in the air93 and a large marine serpent with branching horns like those of a stag and a mane like that of a seahorse We learn further that this marine serpent has a black neck, a white head, a red belly and a multicoloured back; that it can be caught with the help of music; that a stool made with its vertebra can both cure the sitter of podagra and serve to protect the house in which it stands from vermin, and that this serpent’s head yields stones that are used for talismans 94 Another deathly dark-green serpent from the Egyptian desert is humanheaded with a curly beard 95 A serpent from the mountains of Inner Armenia has a fishtail, a bird’s head and is adorned with many colours, while another from the same region has two breasts and, if not deathly, is able to inflict harm 96 The most vicious of all serpents is the pale yellow “Basiliskos” (“the queen”), whose head is crowned by tufts of hair Whoever so much as sees it dies

97 The fatal look of the basilisk is also noted by Eznik of Koghb (Elc alandocʿ, tr and ed Mariès and Mercier, 1959, p 594, ch 140) 98 Ullmann, 1994, pp 30 87–8, pp 101–15 87–8 When discussing the basilisk’s noxious influence, Pliny records that when struck with a spear the force of its poison was such that it could run up the spear and would kill not only the rider but also the horse (Naturalis Historia VIII 33) A reflection of this ancient belief may be found in Ibn Waḥshiyya’s text on poisons which states that:
There is a kind of snake called mādhyānā at the boundary of the countries of the Bājarmā [in the Arabian peninsula], between it and Media toward the side of Armenia Its temper is that it bites the stone thrown at it If this happens, then the man who threw the stone dies on the spot This is when the thrower does not shoot at it; if he does, then he dies more quickly than the one who does not shoot

on the same day,97 and the sound of its hiss is equally deadly to the hearer Any animal moreover that tastes the flesh of a person killed in such a way will immediately die in its turn 98 The physicians Abū ʿAlī Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn Mandawayh (d 410/1019) from Iṣfahān and Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Sīnā who came from a village near Bukhara (whose name was latinised as Avicenna; d 428/1037) both mention that the “Basiliskos” serpent exists in the land of the Turks 99 In his text on poisons Ibn Waḥshiyya also mentions serpents which exist in the valley of the Khazluj in the land of the Turks noting that “if a man sees these snakes, he dies; also if the snake looks at him, he dies immediately ”100 Al-Damīrī similarly records in his Ḥayāt al-Ḥayawān that the gaze of some serpents exerts a baleful influence and can indeed be mortal 101 The same phenomenon is also described in the traditional tale of Alexander There is said to have been a deep pit (biʾr) at a cemetery near Hamadān Everybody who looked into it died at once When Iskandar could not find a solution, he wrote to Aristotle who recommended him to place an iron mirror at the mouth of the pit and only to look into the pit when the mirror was blank Iskandar followed this advice and for seven days the mirror was obscure, only appearing blank on the eighth day He then ordered that someone should descend into the cavity, but his people refused Eventually an animal was sent down and when it was clear that no harm had come to it, a slave
descended in turn At the bottom he saw a large coiled serpent with one central eye lying dead Iskandar had it dragged from the pit When he learned of all this, Aristotle explained to Iskandar that the serpent’s eye was the source of its venom, which was why all those who looked at it died immediately When the giant serpent saw its own reflection in the mirror it was bound to perish as well 102 These references show that in particular the eyes of the creature are considered to be the seat of a specific fear-inspiring power which is believed to be potentially fatal Further evidence of the persistence in Islamic times of a tradition relating to the legendary power of the serpent’s sharp-sightedness and penetrating gaze can be found in the saying that vipers and related snakes (af ʿā) live to an age of a thousand years, and that when they become blind, regain their sight by rubbing their eyes against the fennel plant (rāziyānaj) 103 The tradition is probably distantly associated with the Greek drakōn, synonymous with ophis, serpens and other words for serpents104 which were used for living (real) as well as mythical serpents, said to derive its name from the root derk, meaning “to see ”105 Macrobius clearly derives the name draco from this root “for they say that this serpent has the keenest vision and counterfeits the nature of the star that is ever watchful; for this reason, furthermore, the protection of shrines, holy places, oracles, and treasures is entrusted to serpents ”106 In this context it is interesting to note the belief in the special property of the dhubābī type of

emerald (zumurrud) It was said that when this stone was brought close to the serpent’s eyes they would bulge from their sockets and burst 107 According to Ibn Waḥshiyya’s ninth-century text on poisons, it is the acorn-headed viper who responds in such a manner to the sight of the green emerald 108 The phenomenon was tested by the thirteenth-century Arabian mineralogist Aḥmad al-Tifāshī (580/1184–651/1253) and still found to be true 109 That the belief was widespread in the medieval Islamic world is shown by its figurative use in philosophical arguments, for instance by the ninth-century Muʿtazilite theologian Ibn al-Rāwandī in his book against prophecy, which he entitled Kitāb al-Zumurrud (“Book of the Emerald”) because as he informs the reader:
One of the properties of the emerald is that the eyes of snakes dissolve and melt away if they look at it, and similarly, if an adversary peruses this book, he melts away [i e , his arguments are silenced] 110
The notion of the potency of the image, exemplified in the biblical story of the invasion of poisonous snakes which so devastated the people of Israel that Moses intervened on their behalf, setting a miraculous bronze image of a serpent on a pole (Numbers 21:4–9),111 is related to the magical principal of effecting a cure for snake venom by looking at the image of the serpent In other words, it is a case of correspondence magic predicated on the principle that similia similibus curantur where a representation of the danger or of the disease helps in some way to exorcise it 112 In medieval Islamic toxicological treatises the section on the preparation of poisons was as prominent as that devoted to their prophylaxis and treatments In Ibn Waḥshiyya’s text the preparation of poisons and their antidotes often also involves a mixture of magical rites, incantations and astrology 113 The description of the prepara
tion of a poison with a snake as main ingredient and its symptoms reads as follows:
There is a snake found in the desert called the black snake It is one of the strong snakes called “the black which strips” because all snakes shed their skins once a year except the black which sheds four times every season of the year It is so called because of the frequency of its shedding This snake is taken and put into a wide, glass or clay vessel It is cut into four pieces so that all its blood flows in the vessel Its head is cut as one piece, and four fingers [width] below its head for every piece This is carried out until the four or five pieces are finished and the blood comes together in the vessel Set the pieces aside in something else so that the blood only will be in its vessel Pay attention to the amount of its weight for the same amount of yellow sulfur is taken This must be pure and good; it is pulverized finely and then sprinkled on the blood as long as the blood is fluid and mixes well with it The head and tail [of the snake] are set aside but the pieces of its body are cremated with wood of mezereon until all becomes ash This is then added to the blood and sulfur and mixed well by pulverization in the vessel until it needs moisture for its excessive dryness It is moistened either with the blood of an animal or with the urine of a little boy until it is wet Then the head and tail are thrown on it, side by side, and pulverized with it until all are mixed It is gathered into a black lead vessel and covered with a well-fitting lid [i e , of black lead], then buried in ass manure for twenty-one days At the time of the hunting of the black [snake], its cutting, pulverizing, and mixing and at the time of its bleeding, the Moon must be adjoined to Mars or associated with it When it is taken out after twenty-one days, it is found that it has become deeply black and has a very bad odor with a strong sharpness Whoever carries out this work must fortify the atmosphere with two pieces of cotton soaked in violet oil which is so pure that there is nothing dearer than it or oil of nenuphar together with oil of pumpkin He also smells sandalwood upon which

rosewater has been poured When the cover of the black lead vessel is opened, air must be allowed to pass through for an hour to decrease the odor If you wish that it have the power of killing within six hours, leave it so; if you wish that it be fatal immediately, without delay and tarrying, pulverize the penetrating things which are eaten and drunk This reaches the core of the body While one of the two is dry and the other moist, gather both together and add them to the poison you have macerated Mix them all well Certainly it can be lethal on the spot without delay I recite the praise of the old one [God], the generous, the kind, the beneficent for those who know him and worship him and for those who do not know him and do not worship him! When you want to use this to kill, weigh out one carat and mix it with any food, drink, gruel, or any odoriferous substance It works when it reaches the belly or touches a spot on the body, wounds it and then, after a while, kills him It is penetrating and sharp Whoever drinks this poison which is extracted from the black snake and sulfur, then his symptoms are that he becomes very restless, his eyes become red, his tongue swells, and he is so thirsty that a drink of water does not quench it [i e , the thirst]; his tongue lolls and his voice is remote, his eyes pop out, all the veins of his body are gorged with blood, he becomes very anxious, and often he cries until he dies 114
Ibn Waḥshiyya, moreover, records an interesting operation which can be lethal by sound It involves a compound agent, one of the central ingredients being three large vipers, used to anoint two hides and the wood of a drum, which when struck “kills by the sound when it is heard ” Once the agent has been applied three times and has dried, the drum has to be struck with a stick made of the branch of an olive tree Drum and stick have to be set apart and when the Sun sets on a Tuesday evening, the drum and stick have to be placed facing Mars, preferably when the Moon is adjoining Mars or when Mars is rising This is followed
by a long incantation which repeatedly focuses on the drum and stick along with fumigations Thereafter if one wishes to kill someone, one should strike the drum when the Moon is associated with Saturn While striking the drum one should sing in praise of Mars and “whoever hears this voice dies either on the same day or after three hours following the darkness of the night have passed ”115
d The serpent(-dragon) stone
Belief in the healing properties of a magic serpent stone (Pers shāh-muhra) is ancient and widespread and refers to a precious stone located either in the head of the dragon116 or in its mouth, that is, one that would be expectorated by the ophidian creature 117 The idea that serpents have precious stones in their heads is recorded in the Indian Panchatantra, a collection of stories and fables, originally written in Sanskrit in the third century bc 118 It is propounded in the Koiraniden of Hermes Trismegistos and related texts in which the occult medical effects of the organs of animals are described 119 Examples include a large mythical serpent in the western sea with cervid-type dendritical antlers and a mane like that of the seahorse, a creature said to have stones in its head that are used for talismans 120 Such a serpent stone is also mentioned in Ibn Waḥshiyya’s ninth-century text on poisons and their antidotes He specifies that:
There is a bead (kharaza) in the neck of the viper between its head and body It is not found and is not clear except in large vipers which have aged for hundreds of years This bead is found on its neck When you take this bead at the time of the rising of the sign of Aries, whatever climate it may be, with the left hand and fasten it tightly with parchment of the fawn by means of a white silk thread, and after he fastens it, if he wishes, he sews it in a tanned hide and hangs it fastened

121 Tr Levey, 1966, pp 69–70 122 Real bezoar stones, that is to say, hard round concretions, are also said to be obtained from the body of wild goats (the concretions are believed to have formed, for instance, in the head, the heart or the intestines, especially the stomach) indigenous to Iran and the lands on the borders of China that live chiefly on poisonous serpents; the bezoar is said to form when the animal has eaten too much snake flesh Cf Ruska, “Bezoar,” EI1 I, p 710; for a detailed description, see al-Damīrī, Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā, tr Jayakar, 1906, vol 1, pp 222–5 and n 1; Ettinghausen, 1955, pp 280–1 and n 29, pp 283–5, and n 52 The twelfth-century Jewish theologian Ibn Maymūn/Maimonides notes with regard to the bezoar:
Of the bezoar there is no mention in Galen’s writings The bezoar stone, called animal bezoar, is an acorn-like object of green to blue-green hue It is formed layer upon layer, like some shell heaped one upon another People say its origin is in the medial eye-corner of the Oriental ram; others believe it is formed in the gallbladder, which is indeed the case
Treatise on Poisons and Their Antidotes, tr and ed Muntner, 1966, pp 17–8 According to other accounts, bezoar stones are also believed to be found in different animals as well as
human beings; cf Molnár with an appendix by Zieme, 1984, pp 128–9 On the bezoar, see also Pseudo-Aristoteles, Das Steinbuch, tr and ed Ruska, 1912, pp 147–9 A thirteenthor fourteenth-century gold bowl with a mounted bezoar stone attached by a gold chain, perhaps produced in the Caucasus, is now housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, inv no 1140, published by Ettinghausen, 1955, p 282, pl XXXIX, no 6 123 Massé, 1938, vol 1, p 210 124 Meisami, 1995, pp 25, 280, 7:54 125 Ḥayāt al-ḥayawān al-kubrā, tr Jayakar, 1906, vol 1, p 636 126 Steingass, 1892, repr 1981, p 1107 For the association of dragons with pearls, see also the Iranian legend of Azhdahāk (that is, Azhi Dahāka) giving a huge pearl to a concubine Tchukasizian, 1964, p 325 See pp 62–3 127 Bāṇa, Harshacharita, tr Cowell and Thomas, 1897, pp 250–2 128 See the linguistic discussion in Molnár with an appendix by Zieme, 1984, pp 104–16 129 Bosworth, “yada Tash,” EI2 XI, 226a For further discussion, see Rashīd al-Dīn, tr and ed Quatremère, 1836, pp 428–35 An in-depth study of the phenomenon is found in Molnár with an appendix by Zieme, 1984 Cf DeWeese, 1994, pp 175–6, n 24
on his left upper arm, then it serves to keep away from him the evils of the vipers and that of all snakes ... When the vipers and any snakes touch his body, then they become soft; their hatred goes out ... As to what Shūshā ordered, he said that the bead of the snake is taken during the rising of the sign of Aries and is tied in the slough of the snake, then sewed in a tanned hide The man fastens it on his middle where he binds the trouser band If snakes sting him, then it is not harmful to him He requires only a mild remedy to avoid death, becoming black or blue in colour, and lessening in power 121
A “snake-stone,” often linked with a bezoar (bāzahr, a corruption of the Pers pād-zahr, lit “protecting (against) poison”),122 that is, a concretion or “stone,” found in a snake or another animal, can be used in an amulet against the Evil Eye and illness 123 That it is also supposed to work as an antidote against snake venom is indicated by the twelfth-century poet Niẓāmī Ganjawī when he states that:
from the thorny rose there comes rose water; life from the snake-stone 124
And about two hundred years later al-Damīrī (d 808/1405) records that there is one type of serpent, for whose bite “the bezoarstone (aldiryâq) is useful ”125 Talismanic virtue is also ascribed to the guharmuhra:
a pearl said to be found in a serpent’s head and to secure the owner’s continual good luck 126
Pearls and their association with serpents also appear in a legend in the seventh-century Sanskrit text Harshacharita (“The Deeds of Harṣa”) According to the story a pearl necklace, “which shone like a cluster of stars,” born of the tears of the Moon god, became an antidote to poison and came into the possession of Vāsuki, the king of serpents The latter always carried it with himself to soothe the burning heat of poison and eventually presented it to Nāgārjuna during his stay in the Netherworld 127 The belief in a rain stone (Turk yai, Mong yada),128 often a bezoar placed in water, which was widespread among the Altaic people of Inner Asia in the medieval period seems to have spread from the early Turks to the Mongols The rain stone could be used in weather magic and by its means the holder could magically cause rain or snow to fall or to cease 129 In his treatise on mineralogy, Azhār al-afkār fī jawāhir al-aḥjār (“Best Thoughts on the Best of Stones”), written around 637/1240, Aḥmad al-Tifāshī describes the use of such a stone in a rain-making ritual conducted by an old Turkish weather-magician in the camp of the Khwārazm-shāh Muḥammad Khān, which took place under the personal supervision of the sulṭān:
Then [the old Turk] took a live snake of the same colour as the [rain] stone, and fixed it [by

The army of Jatah had not strength for the fight, So they sought help from the magic stone With the stone of Jadah, who was a magician,
They filled the world with wind and rain, The clouds roared with thunder and the winds howled A thunderbolt fell upon the earth
Although the sun was in Orion, a host of dark clouds suddenly filled the sky The thunder resounded and the lightning flashed The elements rushed out from the ambush of destiny into the open plain of the ether, and the thunderclaps re-echoed round the azure vault of heaven The arrows of lightning were shot out, in all directions, from the bow of the thunder-clouds, and the rain shot down its whistling darts It seemed as if the Fates had again become prey to the love of rebellion and confusion Such a quantity of water descended from the eyes of the stars, that the Deluge seemed to occur a second time”

In his Taʾrīkh-i jahān-gushāy (“The History of the World-Conqueror”) ʿAlā al-Dīn ʿAṭa-Malik al-Juwaynī (623/1226–681/1283) reports how Genghis Khān’s son Toluy resorts to using the magical stone to produce snow as a means of concealment when hard pressed by the Tungusic Jurchen army during his invasion of northern China (Chīn) in 1232 Among his army was a Qanqlī Turk, a yaichi/yadachi (master of the art of yai/yada) who was well versed in the science of this stone and whom he ordered to make use of the weather magic in warfare:
Ulugh Noyan commanded him to begin practising his art and ordered the whole army to put on raincoats over their winter clothes and not to dismount from their horses for three days and nights The Qanqli busied himself with his yai so that it began to rain behind the Mongols, and on the last day, the rain was changed to snow, to which was added a cold wind From this excessive summer chill, which was such as they had not experienced in winter, the Khitayan army
were disheartened and dismayed and the Mongol army emboldened and exhilarated 131
The account thus details the military use of weather magic as a meteorological weapon employed to enhance nomadic martial tactics On yet another level, the “philosopher’s stone,” the universal remedy endowed with the power of transmutation, is allegorically compared to the serpent stone in the Kitāb Mānī rasūl Allāh, a short treatise attributed to Mani (216–c 277), son of Pattēg, the founder of the dualist religion of Manichaeism, proclaiming the great secret:
Blessed be he who knoweth the Tree of Beatitude The distinguishing mark of this noble tree is the following: it only grows where goodness and blessing is to be found Its fruit has a sweet, bitter, sour, bilious taste, from it emanates a tomb-like stench Only few eat from it for it is deadly poison However if you eat knowingly from it, you will not die, since it contains both poison and theriac [or theriac as well as poison], as is the case with the serpent Our stone resembles the serpent, one can find it in the treasuries of kings and in the houses of sages, but one can also find it on the rubbish heaps, because fools spurn it and sages and scholars err with regard to its value When you wish to pick from the fruits of the tree, it will cry and shed tears Do not let yourself be frightened by this, rather pick them boldly and do not be frightened by it and its tears, because its tears banish suffering and illnesses, which it can generate, into the earth 132



the dragon and the province of magic and divination 183
a The dragon and talismans
As has been seen in preceding chapters, the range of symbolic meanings associated with the figure of the dragon extends to include an important role in those branches of knowledge that encompass the more esoteric or magical sciences, in particular sympathetic and talismanic astrological magic and the preparation of verbal and material talismans The dragon’s ability to eclipse the great luminaries is allegorically treated in the quest for “mastery” of magic and the concomitant mystical illumination of life This is apparent in medieval Islamic literature such as Niẓāmī’s Iskandar-nāma The story recounts how the well-known sage and magician of the first century ad, Apollonius/Balīnūs, who in the Islamic Middle Ages became known as the great master of talismans (ṣāḥib al-ṭilasmāt),1 overcomes a powerful priestess, Āẓar Humā, who had transformed herself into a black dragon to guard the holy fire of the temple 2 However the wise Balīnūs not only breaks the resistance of the dragon-priestess but, interestingly, also marries her and manages in so doing to acquire knowledge of many of her magical practices Niẓāmī’s account makes clear that it was only his association with Āẓar Humā that enabled Balīnūs to become a famous magician 3 It is notable that solely through union with a priestess who has the power to transform herself into a dragon can the great talisman-maker Balīnūs acquire knowledge of the magical sciences In one of the oldest popular Persian prose narratives, the Kitāb-i Samak ʿAyyār, the magnanimous hero Samak is said to be taught two charms, one for dispelling serpents and another for calling them forth 4 Similarly, the
pre-Islamic romance, Wīs u Rāmīn, translated and versified in the mid-eleventh century, mentions snake charming by means of sorcery 5 The magical aspect of the dragon is allegorically alluded to by ʿAsjadī Marwazī (as indicated by his nisba he was presumably a native of Marw), a court poet of sulṭān Maḥmūd of Ghazna, who writes:
Don’t expect the world to be good to you The snake is only [made] kind by the power of magic 6
An important magical science was talismanic astrology On the premise that stars can predetermine the course of future events, and that those well-versed in the motions of the heavens can accordingly foretell the future, the position of Islamic religious doctrine was, as already mentioned, fundamentally antithetical to astrological science However, while astrology contented itself with mere prediction, magic on the other hand concerned itself with harnessing the forces of the cosmos to achieve predetermined ends Between these two categories, there was also the magic of theurgy (ṭilsam), the adjuration of divine powers, which concerned itself among other things with the making and the use of talismans, a process dictated by the observance of specific conditions in the making of objects designed to protect the bearer 7 Islam ultimately accepted the use of “magic” and theurgy under certain strict conditions Hence binding supernatural beings to human purposes was allowed as long as the aim was not to bring harm (so-called “white” or “natural” magic, ʿilm al-sīmiyā), which to a certain extent validated the use of amulets and talismans The astrological iconography of the twelve zodi

8 Fahd, “Shams,” EI2 IX, 291a 9 Hartner, 1938, pp 149–50 It is of note that the serpentdragon image is to be cast into the salt sea, that is the Dead Sea, presumably meant as symbol of death A baraita (extracanonical Mishna) similarly maintains that “all planets except the sun and moon are “permissible” as are all faces except the human face and all figures except the dragon,” as cited in Epstein, 1997, p 142, n 38 For a detailed discussion of rabbinic texts on the theme of the dragon and idolatry, see Schlüter, 1982, pp 62–129 10 Wilson, 2001, pp 124–5 11 Cited after the English translation by Hartner, 1938, p 150 For a German translation, see Chwolsohn, 1856, vol 2, pp 484–5; Schlüter, 1982, p 130
12 Hartner, 1938, p 150 See however Schlüter’s (1982, pp 141–1) suggestion that Maimonides, who in spite of being well-versed in astrology was, as is generally known, ill-disposed towards the science, may thus intentionally have equated the Moon teli with the deraqon (which the Mishna so expressly proscribed) partly in order to take distance from his contemporaries who placed such great importance on the Moon teli 13 Fahd, “Siḥr,” EI2 IX, 567b 14 Idem Cf Porter, 2006, p 794 15 O’Connor, 1994, p 67 16 Iḥyāʾ, vol 1, pp 49–50, as cited in Fahd, “Ruḳya,” EI2 VIII, 600a
acal signs and the seven planets fulfils a central function in talismanic design The visual conceptualisation of the dragon thereby also plays a role, rendered as part of particular conjunctions which form the basis for astrological prediction The Qurʾānic exhortation not to worship the Sun and Moon, two signs created by God, occurs once (sūra 41, 37) 8 The codification of Rabbinic laws, Mishna, also specifically refers to images of the Sun, the Moon and, in addition, of the dragon, all of which must have been commonly represented in or before at least the fifth century ad (certainly the latest possible date of the composition of the Mishna), resulting in the Talmudic tract ʿAvodah Zarah (“Mishna on Idolatry” 3, 3) which contains the following prescription:
Whenever a vessel is found on which the picture of the sun, or of the moon, or of a dragon (draqōn) is shown, it must be thrown into the salt sea 9
Rabbi Judah explains with regard to the imagery of the dragon (deraqon) that it is “anything that has fringes between the joints of the neck ”10 Commenting on this prohibition of the use of idolatrous images of the luminaries and the dragon in Moreh Nebukhim (“The Guide for the Perplexed”) the great twelfth-century Jewish theologian Abū ʿImrān Mūsā ibn ʿUbaid Allāh ibn Maymūn/Maimonides (1135–1204) says:
When the picture of the sun or the moon is mentioned, this does not mean that the picture of the sun is represented by a round disk, or that of the moon by a bow, but it refers to those figures which are called telesmata, and which are ascribed to the stars by the men who made them Thus, for instance, they used to represent Saturn like a black old man, Venus like a gold-adorned fair young girl, the sun as a crowned king sitting on a chariot, and likewise they ascribe many figures to all of the constellations and stars though there is no agreement on it among them ... But the picture of the dragon [deraqon] which is
mentioned in this Mishna is a scaled and finned figure like that of a fish This figure was highly renowned with them because they attribute it to a certain part of the celestial sphere And one of them who used to make such pictures told me that this one picture represents the dragon in the sphere of the moon [teli] – called in Arabic “al-Djawzahar” – and that it is made after a certain model and in a certain hour As I have never seen such a picture I asked him in what book I might find it mentioned Whereupon he answered me that his teacher himself had devised that picture and confided it to him as a secret, together with many other things 11
It is interesting that Maimonides thereby equates the deraqon with the dragon in the sphere of the Moon (teli), the meaning of the latter however remaining unclear The commentary thus shows, as Hartner put it:
that still in the twelfth century the astrological doctrines of the Djawzahar had by no means become a generally known matter but used to be treated as a secret by the initiated, in such a way that even a highly erudite scholar like Maimonides could make only a rather vague statement about it 12
It reveals, moreover, the extent to which the fabrication of telesmata, or talismans, was shrouded in secrecy It is also associated with the fact that, like astrology, the practice of magic (siḥr) was frowned upon by the religious establishment 13 As objects which were made to protect their owner and to ward off evil, the action of talismans is based on the concept of sympathetic magic,14 which operates through the connectedness and interdependence of all phenomena through their qualities and attributes 15 Magic was defined by the Khurasanian theologian and religious reformer, Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī (450/105805/1111), as “based on a combined knowledge of the properties of certain terrestrial elements and of propitious astral risings ”16

The influential magical manual Ghāyat al-ḥakīm (“The Philosopher’s Goal”), attributed to Abū Maslama Muḥammad al-Majrītī, who wrote between 443/1052 and 448/1056, provides a synthesis of magic with astrology and stresses the importance of using talismans, whether material or verbal (spells) 17 The compilation was inspired by Ṣābian sources,18 which played an important role in the transmission of esotericism from late antiquity into early Islam, and by “‘Indianised’ hermeticist astrology.”19 Taking inspiration from the tenth-century compilations of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ, al-Majrītī wrote:
magic essentially comprises two parts, one theoretical and one practical The first consists in knowledge of the positions of the immobile heavenly bodies (which is where, in fact, the forms are located), the modalities of their radiation on the planets and, finally, aspects of conjunctions of the celestial spheres at the precise moment that the successful outcome of a project is desired Under this heading the ancients placed everything having to do with discernment of the beneficial and of the baleful and with theurgy As for practical magic, it consists in the knowledge of three domains of the created being and of the qualities of the planets which would be disseminated there 20
Ibn Khaldūn, who knew the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm, goes further in his prolegomena on the history of the world, al-Muqaddima, stating that:

Among the images of the planetary gods described by al-Majrītī in the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm, one combines the Sun, the Moon and Jupiter with the imagery of the dragon 22 In one source cited by al-Majrītī the Sun is portrayed in the form of a standing male figure holding a shield in his left hand and having under his feet the image of a dragon;23 in another he appears as a crowned king, enthroned with a dragon under his feet and a raven in front of him 24 The Moon resembles a woman with a beautiful countenance, girded by a dragon A pair of serpents crown her horned head, another pair encircle her wrists while above and below her head are seven-headed dragons 25 Again, in the first cited source the Moon is portrayed as a woman who sits on a pair of dragons, each biting the tail of the other 26 Jupiter is a male figure with lion head and raptor’s feet, with a polycephalic (or seven-headed) dragon under his feet 27 The significance of a talisman lies in its conjunction with the celestial bodies;28 hence talismanic astrology plays a central role in its preparation 29 The magician is warned of the eclipses of the Moon and the Sun and instructed to delay making the talisman until the Moon is free of the knot (node) 30 He is further warned of worse calamity when the Moon “foregoes ... the head or the tail (taqaddama); because then he will be ‘burnt’ through the conjunction (bimulāqāt) of his body with that of the Sun,”31 the reason being that when “passing from northern

to southern latitudes, the Moon develops maleficent qualities ”32 Instructions are given for the manufacture of an amuletic seal ring stone which has the extraordinary power of bringing about the disappearance of the wearer’s enemies, and of instilling fear and terror into enemies The making of it requires great precision and should be done at the hour of the zodiacal sign of Jupiter and the first decan of the domicilium of his exaltation, which is Cancer 33 At this time green corundum should be engraved with the male figure of Jupiter rendered with a lion head and raptor’s feet, holding a lance (mizrāq) with which he stabs a dragon that lies under his feet 34 Another interesting association with the head of the dragon (raʾs al-tinnīn) is made in the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm describing in gruesome detail the severance of a man’s head, carried out on a living subject, for divinatory purposes 35 The soothsaying head is then posted in front of the raʾs al-tinnīn, denoting probably a navagraha relief 36 Basing himself on the idea that the Intellect and the Soul have intermediary roles in the Creation of the natural world, which again echoes the well-known Rasāʾil (Epistles) of the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ, al-Majrītī allegorically states in the Ghāyat al-ḥakīm that if inclined towards the intellect, the soul will be illuminated by it, but if it moves away from the intellect the knot of the dragon’s tail will eclipse the Sun and the Moon 37 Associated notions are also known in Jewish mysticism, discussed by the thirteenth-century mystic Abraham Abulafia in a passage from the Otzar Eden HaGanuz, where he goes so far as to
refer to the knots of the jawzahr (teli) as knots of love and mystical union:
And the cosmic axis (teli) is none other than the knot of the spheres, and there is no doubt that this is the subject of their existence, like the likeness of the connection of the limbs within man, and the connection of the limbs in man which are suspended in the bones at the beginning are also called the axis in man as well And its secret is that a magician bring this knot of desire and renew it in order to preserve the existence of this compound for a certain amount of time And when the knot is undone, the matter of the testimony of the knot will be revealed, and one who cleaves to these knots (qešarim) cleaves to falsehoods (šeqarim), for as they are going in the future to be undone, the knots of his cleaving will also be undone, and nothing will remain with him any more, and therefore, before he loosens these, he must tie and cleave to the ropes of love those who have not loosened the knots of his love and the cleaving of his desire; and that is God, may He be exalted; and no other in any sense 38
b The dragon staff
The supernatural and magic power of the rod has been renowned since the dawn of classical antiquity The shape of the caduceus (kerykeion) appears at least as early as the middle of the sixth century bc in the form of the figure eight or in that of twisted serpents 39 First and foremost in Greek mythology it was the attribute of the messenger of the gods, Hermes, whose chthonic character is related to his magic might 40 The symbol’s appearance in the Central Asian region is

testified by its representation as early as the late fourth century bc on gold coinage struck by Sophytes, who ruled over the Oxus region in northern Afghanistan 41 In the Semitic world the shepherd’s rod, stick, or staff (ʿaṣā) could function as a symbol of sovereign rule If used as such it was believed to be a repository of the power of royalty, and when bestowed upon someone it both signified and helped to effect the transfer of this royal force 42 Following the example of the Prophet Muḥammad, the early caliphs carried a spear or staff on ceremonial occasions (ʿanaza) 43 The word serpent or snake (ḥayya) appears in the Qurʾān only in allusion to the staff or rod that Mūsa carried as sceptre of his authority and miraculously transformed into a serpent 44 Of the nine miracles of which the Qurʾān speaks, Mūsā’s turning of his staff into a serpent is the first (sūras 20, 17–24; 27, 10; and 28, 31); he accomplishes this by throwing down the staff which takes the form of a crawling serpent The transformation of Mūsa’s symbol of sovereign rule, into a dragon, is a magical act that proves the Prophet’s authenticity In Mūsā’s duel with the magicians of the pharaoh (firʿawn) the rods and ropes of the magicians were devoured by Mūsā’s serpent-rod (sūras 7, 107 and 117; 26, 32 and 45) He thereby performed a miracle by which God provided evidence of his authenticity as a Prophet In post-Qurʾānic tradition as well as in magical writings this miracle and the miraculous character of the serpentrod play an important part The rod was directly associated with the shape of a serpent45 and could
also take the form of “a writhing serpent the size of a camel ”46 Mūsā is portrayed with such a rod ending in a dragon’s head in one of the surviving folios of Rashīd al-Dīn’s Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh (“Compendium of Chronicles”) transcribed and illuminated in 714/1314–5 at the Ilkhanid capital, Tabriz, which is further discussed below 47 The complete transformation of the rod into a fiveclawed quadruped dragon of Chinese derivation is portrayed in the scene of Mūsā frightening the firʿawn illustrated in a copy of Balʿamī’s Tarjumati tārīkh-i Ṭabarī, probably made in the Jazīra and dated to c 1300, now preserved in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC 48 Trees, and twigs as part of trees, were widely used for religio-magical purposes which relate the rod or wand to an artificial twig 49 This is reflected in the description in Arabic sources of Mūsā’s rod as a “two-pronged fork with a crook under the meeting point of the twigs and when it was turned into a serpent, the two twigs formed the mouth of the serpent with its forked tongue, while the crook took the shape of the crest ”50 The Qurʾānic story of Mūsā’s rod turning into a serpent is, moreover, an example of the living power of the rod 51 Al-Tirmidhī records the popular eschatological belief according to which Mūsā’s rod is one of the things that will reappear in the Last Days When the Beast (al-dābbat al-arḍ) which is spoken of in the Qurʾān (sūra 27, 82)52 becomes manifest as one of the significant signs of the approaching Hour, it will bring with it Mūsā’s

The importance of the serpent-rod lies in its capacity to serve as an instrument for the performing of “magical” actions54 which may be linked to the widespread association of snakes with magic 55 In post-Qurʾānic histories of the Prophet Muḥammad, Mūsā’s miracles play an important part 56 According to al-Kisāʾī, the rod is said to come from Paradise and a long succession of pre-Islamic prophets had previously used it 57 When discussing the contest between Mūsā and the Pharaoh’s magicians, the same author states that the staff metamorphoses, as noted above, into “a writhing serpent the size of a camel ”58 According to al-Ṭabarī, an angel brought the rod 59 Al-Thaʿlabī speaks of it as a miraculous rod which performed wonders such as providing water in a drought, producing milk, honey and fragrant odours, and becoming a fruit-bearing tree when placed by Mūsā in the ground The Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ further list the following endowments: that a double dragon would appear on the two twigs, in other words, that the rod transforms itself into a double dragon, to combat enemies; that the rod was able to divide mountains and rocks and to lead its owner over rivers and seas; that it warns of danger and protects Mūsā and his herd from beasts of prey and assassins;
finally that it was able to transport Mūsā at his will 60 In the eleventh-century magical treatise Ghāyat al-ḥakīm Abū Maslama Muḥammad al-Majrītī cites Plato’s Great Book of the Laws as a source for the performance of the magical transformation of rods or ropes into serpents that can devour anyone who is thrown in front of them 61 The magic power of Mūsā’s serpent-rod was attributed primarily to the words inscribed upon it,62 which consisted of names that were linked to the mystical divine name that was endowed with special power63 and in Arabic magic literature is generally referred to as ism Allāh al-aʿẓam (“the greatest name of God”) 64 The same rod was associated with the symbol of a circle considered to have the power to ward off evil 65 In accordance with ancient Jewish and general Middle Eastern tradition, circles are a symbol of light and hence express the luminous character of the rod 66 In his writings, which draw on pre-Islamic (comprising Hellenistic and Jewish) magical practices, the “master of the art of magic,” Aḥmad ibn ʿAlī al-Būnī enumerates the mystical names on Mūsā’s rod with which “darkness disappeared” and “several strange things are accomplished ”67 Al-Thaʿlabī also records that the rod performed the miracle of shining in the darkness,68 a feature generally considered characteristic of objects of revelation 69

the dragon and sound 191
I heard Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-Fārsī saying: “I became so extremely thirsty in a desert that I could not move any more I had heard that the eyes of thirsty people burst before they die I was waiting for the bursting of my eyes when I suddenly heard a voice I turned my face and saw a white serpent, as bright as pure silver, approaching me I ran fearfully because fear had engendered power in me Then due to weakness I walked slowly while the serpent was still after me In this way I walked, till I reached water The voice grew silent and I could not see the serpent 4
The powerful voice of the dragon is also referred to in an account of the dragon fight of Sām/ Garshāsp, the legendary ruler of Sīstān and grandfather of the hero Rustam When the dragon, who was fifty thousand cubits (gaz) in length, saw Sām, he jumped at him Sām struck him with his mace so that the dragon fell to pieces and “uttered so fearful a cry that all of Sām’s companions fell to the ground in terror ”5 Al-Damīrī also reports that there is one species of serpent, found in abundance in the country of the Turks, whose hiss is deadly even at the distance of a bow-shot and yet another type of serpent, “the voice of which if a man hears, he dies ”6 On the other hand, he cites the interpretation of a dream according to which:
He, who dreams as if a serpent has spoken to him, will obtain happiness 7
A speaking dragon appears in the epic Shāhnāma, during Rustam’s third trial This creature lives underground on the road to Māzandarān8 and the hero inadvertently strays into its terrain The dragon is endowed with the magical power of invisibility, and is portrayed as using his faculty
In his biography of the Prophet Muḥammad, al-Ḥalabī describes how one day the serpent was on top of the wall of the Kaʿba when a large bird snatched it and cast it on the hill of al-Ḥajūn (where the cemetery of Mecca is located):
[...] where it was swallowed by the earth Some people say that this is the creature, which will speak to mankind on the day of Resurrection It is also said that the monster will come forth from the ravine of the mountain Adjyād 1
He thus implicitly seems to associate the serpent with the Beast of the Earth (al-dābbat al-arḍ) mentioned in the Qurʾān (sūra 27, 82) 2 Here the serpent will raise its voice on the day of Resurrection Citing the seventh-century Jewish convert Kaʿb al-Aḥbār, the early medieval writer al-Kisāʾī describes the voice of the great serpent:
When the serpent extols God, its exaltation overwhelms that of all the angels When it opens its mouth, the heavens and the earth are lit by the lightning that flashes Were not this serpent tempered by extolling God, it would strike down all created things with the might of its voice 3
In this tradition its voice is likened to the terrifying sound of thunder, thereby metaphorically associating the dragon with climatological phenomena The voice of a beneficial serpent saves the life of a mystic in a story recorded in Abū Ibrāhīm Mustamlī al-Bukhārī’s (d 434/1042–3) Persian commentary on the celebrated manual on Ṣūfism, Taʿarruf li-madhhab ahl al-taṣawwuf, by Abū Bakr al-Kalābādhī (d 380/990):

rhythm and melody, that is to say, sounds transformed into music, seems to have roots that lie in deep antiquity and which appear to have survived into the Islamic period 13 According to a ninth-century Arabic text on the poisons of serpents, attributed to Hermes Trismegistos, music attracts mythological serpents such as the large serpent in the western sea, referred to earlier, with cervid-type dendritical antlers and a mane like the mane of a seahorse, which can be hunted with the help of music made with cymbals and shawms 14 A comparable phenomenon is recorded by Ibn Waḥshiyya in his late ninth-century text on poisons in which he states that people from Kasadān invented a particular type of bell which brings out serpents and vipers from their holes when they hear the sound 15 That the sound of music can lure serpents out of their caves is similarly reported by the late ninth-century author Abū Hilāl al-ʿAskarī 16 The serpent as well as its larger relative the dragon may thus have been considered susceptible to the transformative influence of the medium of sound and music 17 This aspect of the dragon is given expression by its depiction on musical instruments, which appear in a number of early Ilkhanid paintings portraying a court scene with the enthroned ruler and his consort, housed in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin and in the Topkapı Sarayı Library, Istanbul 18 The court ceremony shows the enthroned couple surrounded by princely relatives and courtiers, both male and female, accompanied by musicians playing a stringed instrument, which again resembles a harp, the arched string arm of which is fashioned in the form of a dragon’s neck terminating in its projecting head (fig 177) Like
of thinking, expressing surprise that the hero dares to sleep in the face of the impending danger of his advance 9 The mythical creature then approaches the sleeping hero, who is twice woken by his loyal steed Rakhsh, but the dragon vanishes On the third approach it is unable to cloak itself and is seen by the hero The exchange of words that ensues between the hero and the dragon serves to anthropomorphise the creature to some extent Nevertheless, with the help of his horse, the hero manages to slay the dragon The speaking anthropomorphised serpent is also known in the most famous Arabian collection of fairy-tales and other stories of the Alf layla wa-layla in the Journeys of Bulūqiyā 10 Mythical serpents endowed with the power of speech appear similarly in Indian lore, such as in the great collection of fables known as the Panchatantra 11 Armenian popular tradition also preserves several tales that contain the motif of the speaking serpent such as the story of the Magic Ring 12 To this may be added the speaking serpents of antiquity in Ptolemy I’s account of the Siwah expedition of Alexander the Great Arrian (II 3 2) records the interesting story that Alexander was guided to and from the oracle by two giant dragons uttering speech This aspect appears already in Hesiod’s account of the hundred serpent heads that issue from the shoulders of the dragon Typhon which spoke in many voices (phonai), at times those of different animals and, at times, sounds only the gods could understand (Theogony 825–52) The belief in the serpent-dragon’s receptivity to sounds that create a pattern such as tone,

whose head is turned towards the harpist (figs 178a and b) Another indirect association of the dragon with music is shown on one of the earliest wall paintings at Panjikent, which has been dated to the late fifth century, on the eastern wall of the northern chapel of Temple II Here the dragon serves as zoomorphic throne for a goddess identified as deity of the river Zerafshan20 to whose right is a rectangular musical instrument with attached bells The affiliation of the goddess with the instrument has led Martha Carter to point out an analogy with the ancient Hindu Saraswatī (who is also known in Buddhism), goddess of music and learning, who is also a river goddess 21 Vestiges pertaining to elements of both the musical and the aquatic qualities of the dragon can still be found in the more recent history of Central Asia They recur in the songs of Kazakh shamans who also use a stringed musical instrument (kobyz) of which they say:
I took in my hands a kobyz made of a pine-tree And wind like a water serpent 22
the overall pictorial scheme of the painting, the dragon head is rendered in an east Asian manner, the closed jaws characterised by fleshy folds on the bridge of the snout which is terminating in a prominent curl and with flowing mane and beard springing from the chin It is interesting to consider the possibility of music as a civilising force which in turn would have had a subsuming and, hence, taming effect on the nature of the dragon, a change suggested by its appearance at the tip of a musical instrument The closest example to the Ilkhanid dragon harp can perhaps be found in seventh- or eighthcentury Panjikent in Sogdiana In spite of the tremendous chronological hiatus this may be of some relevance Among the epic cycles portrayed on the Panjikent wall paintings there are at least two that depict original Sogdian legends 19 One of these includes the well-known figure of a musician that serves as a caryatid supporting an arch The tip of her large harp-like stringed instrument terminates in a dragon head with open mouth and elongated, curved upper proboscis-like snout

the dragon as symbol of transformation 195
The dragon can be said to symbolise the liminal or transitional phase in rites of passage As such it evokes a dual response, perceived both as beneficent and an object of fear This results also in its twin functions as deliverer and destroyer, roles that link it to the elemental cycle of birth and death Interestingly, the Targum Onkelos, an Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, renders the west Semitic root nḥš (“serpent”) as Aramaic ḥiwyaʾ (“serpent”) whose Arabic cognate is ḥayya (“serpent”) 1 There may be, moreover, an etymological association of nḥš and the Akkadian nêsu (naāšu) meaning “to live, to stay alive, to recover ” The temptation to see this cognate as an indication of a semantic relation between the terms “serpent” and “life” has repeatedly been succumbed to 2 The hypothesis appears to be substantiated by the fact that the root ḥyw apparent in the word ḥay[w]āt, as described by Ibn Manẓūr (d 711/1312) in his Lisān al-ʿArab (completed in 689/1290), entails the concept of life as opposed to death 3 He further states that “the plural of all that is alive is ḥay[w]āt (“life”) and that ḥayawān (“the animal kingdom”) implies a notion of life (ḥayāt) ”4 The word ḥay[w]āt is once mentioned in the Qurʾān (sūra 29, 64) where it means “the true life” and is used of the afterlife Ibn Manẓūr adds that “ the derivation of ḥayya (“serpent”) from ḥayāt is well-known ”5 The same author
more clearly specifies that “ when the life of a man or a woman is prolonged, he or she is called ḥayya; this is due to the long life of the ḥayya and that is why the man or the woman is described as ḥayya for his or her prolonged life ”6 That childbirth was associated with the dragon in its beneficent aspect seems to have been a view widely held in antiquity 7 Remnants of such notions seem perhaps to resonate in texts such as the Kitāb Tadbīr al-ḥabālā wa ’l-aṭfāl (“Book of Children and Pregnant Women”), written by Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Baladī (d c 380/990) who served as physician to the Egyptian vizier Abu ’l-Faraj yaʿqūb ibn yūsuf ibn Killīs in the tenth century There he gives the following instruction to ease birth:
a snake skin wound around the hip of a woman accelerates birth 8
According to another tradition, a snake’s scale placed on a pregnant woman, presumably when she is in labour, will ensure an easy delivery 9 In the epic romance Wīs u Rāmīn these notions are reflected in Fakhr al-Dīn Gurgānī’s allegorical imagery:
the sun is delivered from the dragon 10
Serpents or dragons also play a symbolic role in the miraculous birth and apotheosis of numer
Klodones and Mimallones, and imitated in many ways the practices of the Edonian women and the Thracian women about Mount Haemus, from whom, it would seem, the word thrêskeuein came to be applied to the celebration of extravagant and superstitious ceremonies

13 Cf P’yankov, 2006, pp 505–11, esp pp 506–7 14 This myth was modified by Valerius Flaccus to the extent that the Scythians were said to be descendants of Colaxes (the youngest son of Targitaos who reigned in Scythia was named Colaxais; Herodotus, Histories IV 5) and the anguipede earth-born maiden, and in the account of Diodorus Siculus (II 43) according to which the same woman was impregnated by Zeus 15 Jakobson and Szeftel, 1949, pp 13–87, esp 21, 64; Schirmunski, 1961, pp 58–9 It is interesting that comparable notions occur in early Christian gnostic writings, such as a text entitled Baruch written by the second-century Christian gnostic Justin, which survives in summarised form in the early third-century antiheretical work, Refutatio omnium haeresium (“Refutation of All the Sects”) of Hippolytus of Rome According to his recapitulation of the text, in the beginning creation results of the marriage of a male divine principle, Elohim, the God of creation and Lord of heaven, and a female principle, named Eden or Israel, the mother earth, who is described as looking like a woman as far as the groin and a serpent below (Refutatio omnium haeresium 5 24 2-3) Williams, 1996, pp 18–9, 37–9 16 Mélikoff, 1960, vol 1, p 43 and n 1; Dedes, 1996, p 29, n 80 For further examples in South Slavic epics, see Schirmunski, 1961, pp 28–30 17 Marzolph and van Leeuwen, 2004, pp 362–3 The story goes back to the age-old belief that pregnancy could be caused by ingesting magic food See Astour, 1965, pp 171–2 18 Browne, 1920, vol 1, p 435; see also p 363
ous heroes and kings of antiquity 11 Many traditions name them among the ancestors of heroes and as mythical ancestors of tribal confederacies and kingly dynasties 12 The classical author Herodotus reports that the ancient Scythians who lived north of the Black Sea regarded themselves as descendants of the greatest of the Greek heroes, Herakles/Hercules, and a woman with a serpent’s lower body (Histories IV 8–9) 13 With this anguipede woman he engenders three sons, the youngest of whom, named Scythes (“the Scythian”), was the worthiest and became the first king of the Scythians 14 The story of the miraculous birth of the superhuman hero who issues from the encounter of a princess with a serpent appears also in one of the oldest recorded epic tales (bylina) compiled in the eighteenth century in west Siberia 15 Among the tribal confederacies, dynasties and heroes claiming their descent from Dahāk, the hominoid serpent of the ancient Iranian epic past are, as mentioned earlier, the Kushāṇas of the yuezhi confederacy, the Armenians living in the region near Lake Sevan, the Islamic Sām dynasty of Ghūr as well as the hero Rustam and his descendants These claims are surpassed in the Turkish epic Ṣaltūq-nāma (“Book of Ṣaltuq”), in which the first ruler of the world, Eslem, son of Adam, becomes the father of Ẓaḥḥāk
the Turk, ancestor of all Turkish sovereigns 16 The association of serpents with birth symbolism occurs also, albeit in a different manner, in the story of Prince Sayf al-Mulūk in the Alf layla wa-layla The tale recounts how an aged childless ruler is advised by Solomon the Wise that, in order to bring about the birth of a prince, he must cook the flesh of two serpents that appear by a certain tree at noon and serve the dish to his wife 17 More often though, the dragon is known in its other function as the awful dragon of death On the way to his execution the mystic and theologian Manṣūr ibn Ḥusayn al-Ḥallāj (“the wool-carder,” 244/857–309/922) from Ṭūr in Fars, is said to have faced his impeding martyrdom by reciting the following verses:
My friend doth unrelated stand to aught of ruth or clemency: From His own cup He bade me sup, for such is hospitality! But when the Wine had circled round, for sword and [executioner’s] carpet called He Who with the Dragon drinketh Wine in [the heat of] Summer, such his fate shall be 18

Abraham (recension A ch XVII) which is generally considered to be a Jewish work, datable to the first century ad (cf Delcor, 1973, pp 63–5, 72, 76–8), when death comes to fetch Abraham’s soul, he shows him seven flaming drakōn heads as well as the faces of various poisonous serpents In ch XIX, death explains the function of the faces as the different manners of death, while the seven drakōn heads stand for death raging seven aeons long Similar associations of the Greek words drakōn and ophis with death and the underworld appear in the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch See Schlüter, 1982, pp 46–8 For traditions in which Rahav and Leviathan are identified with the angel of death, see Ginzberg, 1909–38, repr 1946 and 1955, vol 1, p 40 and n 187 27 Cf Wensinck, “ʿIzrāʾīl,” EI2 IV, 216b 28 Tr Jayakar, 1906, vol 1, p 655 See also the troublesome dream of Kanaʿān ibn Kūsh, the father of Namrūd (the Nimrod of the Bible), in which his son is born and a snake enters his nose, an ominous sign which is interpreted to mean that his son will kill him Heller, “Namrūd, also Namrūdh, Nīmrūd,” EI2 VII, 952b

When Destiny comes, the wide spaces are narrowed A hundred ways and asylums may lie to left and right; yet they are all barred by Destiny, the invincible dragon 19
A related conceptualisation of the “invincible dragon” appears not only in Arabic and Iranian literature, but in a saying of the military commander ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, a contemporary of the Prophet Muḥammad, in which he likens himself to the “inexorable serpent”:
When others looked askance, I blinked not; Then I partially closed my eyes, but not in winking [at the sight of danger] you saw me return [to the charge] and continue to dash forward I support [equally well] good and evil, and am inexorable, Like the serpent at the foot of the trees 20
Although the Qurʾān makes no allusion to Hell being populated by huge serpents, such a belief is preserved in later traditions It is attested in a ḥadīth by the tenth-century Ḥanafī jurist Abu ’l-Qāsim Isḥāq al-Samarqandī (d 342/953–4), also known as al-Ḥakīm (“the Wise One”), according to which:
the Prophet, blessings and peace be upon him, said that in Hell are snakes each as large as a camel and the pain of their bite will last for forty years 21
In his grave a sinner may be tortured by a serpent of fire which bites him until the day of judgement 22 Another ḥadīth records a more explicit
saying of the Prophet on the torments in Hell inflicted by dragons:
Concerning the chastisement of the truth-concealer in his grave: ninety-nine tinnīns will be given mastery over him Do you know what a tinnīn is? It is a serpent There will be ninetynine serpents, each of which has nine heads: They will gnaw at him, eat at him and blow into his body until the day he is raised up 23
yet another tradition speaks of the punishment for insolence against God:
as a black snake [that] winds itself around the impudent man’s neck and kills him after forty days 24
This belief in the dragon as “inexorable death” is still echoed in the popular culture of Iran, according to which there is a serpent in every grave that will torment the dead in proportion to the number of sins committed in life 25 Similarly, in popular belief in present-day Afghanistan it is said that following burial the mythical angel ʿIzrāʾīl/ʿAzrāʾīl, who has authority and power over death, appears and grips the tongue of the deceased for questioning 26 This idea may reflect the Qurʾānic tradition according to which the angel of death ʿIzrāʾīl creeps into the dying man’s throat to draw out his spirit (sūra 79) 27 In the same way, the fourteenth-century encyclopedian al-Damīrī relates the interpretation of a dream according to which:
He who dreams of a serpent coming out of his mouth while he is ill, will die, for that indicates his life which will have come out of his mouth 28
The early fourteenth-century Syrian traditionist Ibn Kathīr (d 774/1373) reports a ḥadīth on

33 The serpent appears as giver of life and possessor of the magic herb of life in Babylonian literature Searching for the secret of immortality Gilgamesh succeeds in harvesting the magic plant from the bottom of the sea (Epic of Gilgamesh XI 287–9), only to have it stolen from him by the serpent 34 For the story of Glaucos, a son of king Minos of Crete, who was restored to life by a herb placed by a serpent onto a dead serpent which thereupon was brought back to life,
see Ovid, Fasti, VI 749–54, and Apollodorus, Bibliotheca III 3 1–4 A similar story of a young dragon being raised from the dead through the agency of a plant and the same plant being used to resurrect the Lydian hero Tylon, who had been killed by a dragon, is recorded by Pliny (Naturalis Historia XXV 5) 35 Genesis 3,19 36 Genesis 3,14 37 Tr and comm , Mathews, 1998, pp 34–5 38 Tr Meisami, 1995, 25:71 Cf eadem, 1987, p 218 39 De Blois (1990, pp 34–5) shows that since the parable was recorded in several Indian texts, if it was not taken from the Mahābhārata, it would have come from another contemporary Indian source available to Burzōe
authority of Abū Hurayrah according to which the Prophet Muḥammad said:
Anyone who does not remit the obligatory alms of the wealth which God has bestowed upon him, his wealth will appear to him on the Day of Resurrection as an ancient male serpent, bald from age and the accumulation of poison in its head, and with two projections dangling from its forehead It shall coil itself around his neck and, grabbing him on both sides of the face, shall cry out, ‘I am your wealth, I am your treasure!’29
In the Jewish tradition it is also the serpent that has power over life and death 30 In the Talmudic tractate Bava Batra a serpent is said to be the keeper of a miraculous stone that has power of life or death 31 In the same text the angel of death himself is called Leviathan 32 In ancient Near Eastern33 and Greek34 lore the serpent is in the possession of a plant which can restore life The Armenian commentary on the book of Genesis, attributed to the Syriac writer Ephrem, gives further insight into contemporary Christian understanding of the relation of the serpent with death:
Indeed, why did Justice, which interrogated Adam and Eve, not interrogate the serpent? And if the nature [of the serpent] was bound, why was it also condemned with those [Adam and Eve] who had free will? And if it had free will, why did [Justice] not interrogate it? [Justice] did not interrogate [the serpent] for the reason that It knew who It was with whom It was speaking And that one who hears knows what he hears And that the serpent was the first to receive punishment was so that [Adam and Eve] might repent, show compunction and make supplication to [God] But when they were unwilling to turn [to Him] in contrition, [God] set upon them the decree of death, and they became dust, fodder for the serpent ‘From dust you are,’ [God] said,
‘and to dust you shall return ’35 And to [the serpent He said, ‘Dust shall become your food ’36,37
The close association of the mythical creature with the departure from life is underlined by its representation in the thirteenth-century barrelvaulted funerary chapel of Surb Grigor Part of the monastic complex of Noravankʿ in Vayots Dzor in southern Armenia, it was added in 1275 by prince Tarsayich Ōrbēlian, governor of Siunikʿ province, at the north side of the church of Surb Karapet as mausoleum of the Ōrbēlian princes The point of juncture of the wall arch and vaulted ceiling, above the semi-circular altar, is entirely horizontally circumscribed by two pairs of confronted dragons in low relief and highlighted with white and red pigment The elongated serpentine bodies, which are enlivened with a spotted pattern, are arranged in evenly spaced loops (fig 179) In Iranian poetry death is sometimes metaphorically likened to the maleficent influence of the dragon, alluding to the belief that the moon, in eclipse, is swallowed by the eclipse dragon (aljawzahar) In Niẓāmī’s Haft Paykar the officer who brings the false report of the execution of the “bright-faced” luminous harp girl Fitnah to king Bahrām tells him that he has “given the Moon to the Dragon,” that is to say, eclipsed her life 38 The extent of the geographical and chronological dissemination of the dragon’s allegorical role in death is attested by the life stages of a parable called the “Man in the Well” in which it figures prominently It is of great interest since the parable’s sequence of transmission can be documented It was translated into Middle Persian (Pahlawī) from an early Sanskrit text, perhaps from the eleventh book of the great Indian epic Mahābhārata (chapters 5–6),39 together with other texts from the Mahābhārata and the Panchatantra, by Burzōe of Nīshāpūr, the personal

a man out hunting was pursued by a unicorn and in trying to flee, fell into a well As he was falling, he stretched out his arm and caught hold of a small tree growing on the side of the well He thought that he was now safe, but upon closer scrutiny, he found that two mice, one white and one black, were gnawing at the roots of the slender tree to which he was clinging He now looked down into the well and what did he
see but a monstrous dragon with mouth open waiting for him to fall He then examined the place where his feet were resting, and saw four serpents surrounding him Now he looked up at the tree he was holding, and saw some honey dripping down from one of the branches Immediately, the unicorn, mice, dragon, and serpents were forgotten, and his mind became intent only on securing the honey
The Indian interpretation of this parable is closely related:
the unicorn is death, the deep well is the world, the small tree is man’s life, gnawed at its roots by day and night (the white and black mice), the dragon is the jaws of hell, the four serpents are the four great elements that compose the body Surrounded by all these horrors and dangers, man forgets all and thinks only of the pleasures of life
Cited after Ch’en, 1968, p 221 46 The versions of the parable in the Kalīla wa Dimna and the book of Bilawhar wa Būdhāsaf are closely comparable; de Blois, 1990, p 35 The name Būdhāsaf is a corruption of the Sanskrit Bodhisattva, a title acquired by meritorious beings who aspire for Enlightenment (bodhi) 47 Cf Lang, “Bilawhar wa Būdhāsaf,” EI2 I, 1215b The Indian transmission has been complemented with folkloristic parallels and put into an Indogermanic context by Vasil’kov, 1995

A man fled from an enraged camel and out of necessity suspended himself in a well; his hands fell on two branches which were growing above the well and his feet obtained a foothold Soon he could see better that his two feet were on the heads of two snakes who had emerged from their holes His glance fell to the bottom where he saw a terrible dragon with its mouth open in expectation At the top of the well he noticed a white and a black rat incessantly gnawing away at the roots of the branches Meanwhile he considered
how to find a way out of his misfortune In front of him was a beehive where he found a little honey and tasted some He became preoccupied with its sweetness, neglecting his (proper) work so that he did not think of his feet resting on the heads of the four snakes which might withdraw at any moment, or of the rats furiously nibbling the branches with no sign of slackening, until the branches broke and he fell into the maw of the dragon 43
Naṣr Allāh Munshī offers his own interpretation of the parable which confirms the continuous contextual and conceptual validity of the dragon’s maw as metaphor for “inexorable death” in twelfth-century Central Asia:
Thus I have compared the world to that well full of misfortune and dread, and the incessantly gnawing white and black rats to night and day whose succession works to curtail the living The four snakes are the humours that are the basis of man’s nature which when disturbed become deadly poison The tasting of the honey and its sweetness corresponds to the pleasures of this world whose worth is little and brings grief and toil; the dragon is our inexorable death 44
Closely related to the ancient Indian parable of the “Man in the Well,”45 this story was also included in the famous legend of Bilawhar wa Būdhāsaf,46 the Near Eastern version of the Buddhist Jātaka stories of Gautama Buddha 47 The

latter provided the prototype for the popular Christian tale of Barlaam and Joasaph, recorded by the Georgian monk Euthymius (955–1028) 48 The parable with the dragon imagery, the snakes in the story most likely being a reflection of the likeness of the great dragon, thus proved to be meaningful in the long term both within and far beyond the Western Asian world This is further attested by yet another version of the parable recorded by the court poet Manuel Philes (c 1275–c 1345) of the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II, in which however the well was represented as a tree while the dragon’s role at the bottom remained a constant:
On a picture of Life which represents a tree, in which is a man gaping upwards and quaffing honey from above, while below, the roots [of the tree] are being devoured by mice: On seeing this symbol of the shadow of [earthly] things, bear in mind, O man, the end that is hidden from you Standing upright, you are enjoying the honey of pleasure, while a dragon with gaping mouth awaits your fall to destroy you 49
The parable of the “Man in the Well” thus exemplifies the potency of the visual allegory in which the dragon’s maw stands for death, imagery that transcended geographic, cultural and religious boundaries and was long shared not only by the peoples of the medieval Western Asian environment but also by those of adjacent cultures 50 The dragon is hence credited with the possession of great transformative powers The ability to metamorphose, to transcend a situation and respond to changing circumstances, were exactly the qualities associated with the mystic A metaphor of change and transformation on the mystic path, the great mythical beast thus functions as an allegory of his guardianship of heavenly treasure and hidden mysteries, a hermeneutic tool51 of particular significance for the mystic Its affiliation with the notion of the ultimate transformative power of death converts it in the eyes of the mystic into “the dragon of freedom and detachment ”52 This is exemplified by the story of the Iranian mystic Abū Ḥamza al-Khurāsānī told by the
mystic al-Hujwīrī (d 469/1076) in his Kashf al-Maḥjūb, a treatise on Ṣūfism, which again uses the well (or pit) symbolism:
It is well-known that one day he fell into a pit After three days had passed a party of travellers approached Abū Ḥamza said to himself: “I will call out to them ” Then he said: “No; it is not good that I seek aid from anyone except God, and I shall be complaining of God if I tell them that my God has cast me into a pit and implore them to rescue me ” When they came up and saw an open pit in the middle of the road, they said: “For the sake of obtaining divine recompense (thawāb) we must cover this pit lest anyone should fall into it ” Abū Ḥamza said: “I became deeply agitated and abandoned hope of life After they blocked the mouth of the pit and departed, I prayed to God and resigned myself to die, and hoped no more of mankind When night fell I heard a movement at the top of the pit I looked attentively The mouth of the pit was open, and I saw a huge animal like a dragon, which let down its tail I knew that God had sent it and that I should be saved this way I took hold of its tail and it dragged me out A heavenly voice cried to me, ‘this is an excellent escape of thine O Abū Ḥamza! We have saved thee from death by means of death ’53
The pit is a metaphor for life and the dragon a means of achieving liberation from it 54 Hagiographical literature also yields examples of saints receiving help from serpent jinns as is illustrated by the story of shaykh Muḥammad al-Udfūwī who once performed the pilgrimage to Mecca with a group of ṣūfīs who had no provisions:
...so the shaykh held out a bowl and took up a collection from among them saying, “whoever has something and hopes for a divine reward in recompense should put it in this bowl ” A large snake suddenly came forward with a dirham in its mouth and dropped it into the bowl saying, ‘We are jinn who have come to make the pilgrimage with you this year ’55
In the mystical tradition the entire spectrum of the dragon’s multivalent forces is called into play In the hagiography of the great Khurasani mystic

62 Mathnawī VI 2120–1, as cited in Schimmel, 1980, repr 1993, p 313 The motif is also used on talismans as exemplified by the representation of a woman clad in red knee-length pantaloons riding a lion and holding a serpent in the left hand, a seal of the planet Mars, illustrated in the Dahīra al-iskandarīya, 24a, -3 to 24a, -3; cf Ruska, 1926, pp 98–9, with the title, Ṣanʿat al-haraz al-ṭilasmiyya al-nāfiʿa min al-amrāḍ al-ʿasīrat al-burʾ, as cited in Ullmann, 1972, p 419 and n 4 It is noteworthy that this imagery was known in the Jewish tradition; the Talmud mentions that king Nebuchadnezzar rode a lion and held in his hands, as a bridle, a serpent (Sabbath 150a) The same animals, the very deadliest creatures, lions and poisonous serpents, are mentioned in biblical references, for instance “Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder [a venomous snake]; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet” (Psalm 91, 13), symbolising Christ’s triumph over evil Van Henten (1995, repr 1998, p 266) interprets this combination of the dragon and the lion as a result of Iranian influence It may, therefore, not be irrelevant to note that in Zoroastrianism, both lion and serpent figure prominently in Pahlawī literature as creatures of Ahriman, the first as main representative of the “wolf species,” the second most deadly of the khrafstras
Abū Saʿīd ibn Abi ’l-Khayr Mayhanī (357/967440/1049),56 entitled Asrār al-tawḥīd (compiled around 575/1180),57 the shaykh is said to have kept company with dragons during his retreats One day he asked one of his particularly unruly disciples to perform his ablutions at a stream and his prayers on a rock, and then wait for a “friend” of his who had been with him for seven years, and in whose companionship he had found much comfort and relaxation, to convey him his greetings:
Then suddenly there was a dreadful clap and the mountain quaked [The disciple] looked and saw an awful black dragon, the largest he had ever seen: its body filled the whole space between two mountains At the sight of it his spirit fled; he was unable to move and fell senseless to the earth The dragon advanced towards the rock, on which it laid its head reverently After a little while the dervish recovered himself somewhat, and observing that the dragon had come to a halt and was motionless, he said, though in his terror he scarcely knew what he said, “The Shaykh greets thee ” The dragon with many signs of reverence began to rub its face in the dust, whilst tears rolled from its eyes This, and the fact that it attempted nothing against him, persuaded the dervish that he had been sent to meet the dragon; he therefore delivered the Shaykh’s message, which
it received with great humility, rubbing its face in the dust and weeping so much that the rock where its head lay became wet Having heard all it went away 58
The same work contains a collection of sayings attributed to Abū Saʿīd ibn Abi ’l-Khayr, in which there is a passage stating that the celebrated Islamic mystic Abū yazīd (Bāyazīd) al-Biṣṭāmī (d 261/874 or 264/877–8) is said to have mounted a lion brandishing a venomous serpent as a whip 59 A depiction of the angel Abi ’l-Ḥanaf as crowned rider on a lion holding a second crown in his right hand and an upright dragon staff in his left hand is found in a mid- to late thirteenth-century Anatolian manuscript, known as Daqāʾiq al-Ḥaqāʾiq, although the paintings may be of a later date (fig 181) 60 Marianne Barrucand identifies the horned dragon with open mouth and once looped body as a sceptre 61 In the sixth volume of the Mathnawī, Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī describes the eleventh-century mystic Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad Kharraqānī (d 425/1033) in the same manner, portraying him as “the model of a saint who has perfectly mastered his base soul and is therefore master over the lower animals in the world, who are bound to serve him just as his nafs has learned to serve him ”62 The depiction of the mystic riding a dangerous animal such as a lion or a dragon thus symbolises his

subjugation of his somatic self and mastery over his nafs Following ancient popular beliefs the nafs (“soul” or “self”) mentioned in the Qurʾān is said to take the form of a beast, often symbolised as a snake 63 It has to be tamed to eventually overcome the stages of nafs lawwāma (“blaming soul”; sūra 75, 2) and nafs ammāra (“commanding soul”; sūra 12, 53) which correspond essentially to man’s conscience,64 to reach the state of nafs muṭmaʾinna (“the soul at peace”; sūra 89, 27) 65 In Islamic mysticism this serpent can be turned into a “useful rod” just as Mūsā’s rod turned “on God’s command” into a serpent 66 The goal of disciplining the nafs is to train it in such a way that all negative activities associated with it become extinct;67 this may be compared with the manner in which a good snake-charmer who receives a snake, to use a metaphor coined by al-Ghazālī, “distinguishes between the antidote and the poison, and extracts the antidote while destroying the poison ”68 This path is ultimately experienced by the mystic as being drawn upwards, as fanāʾ (“passing away,” “effacement”) in God The mystical path of self-recognition (gnosis), in other words, the return of the self to the Self, is described by al-Biṣṭāmī by means of the analogy of the sloughing of the outward skin of the serpent 69 By virtue of this unsheathing, the serpent gains new skin and thereby new life which is likened to the mystic’s final shedding of his “I”
in fanāʾ Hence in the same manner as the serpent sloughs its old skin and appears newly robed, the mystic annihilates his nafs (lower soul) and lives eternally by undergoing a metamorphosis 70 A similar sentiment is expressed in a couplet of the poet Muḥammad Shīrīn Maghribī born about 750/1350 near Iṣfahān in Central Iran:
Unless you slay the serpent of existence, you cannot find the way to the treasure; Because your existence is a snake upon His treasure 71
In his prose writings Maqālāt, Shams-i Tabrīzī, the spiritual master of Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī, illustrates the breadth of the polyvalence of the dragon in the form of a two-headed serpent that has a head at either end:
The world is a treasure and the world is a serpent Some people play with the serpent and some with the treasure He who plays with the serpent, must bare his heart to its bite It bites with its tail and it bites with its head When it bites with its tail, you will not awake, and then it starts to bite with its head People who have turned their back on the serpent, and have not become proud of its precious stone, mār muhra, and its love, mihr, have taken elderly reason as their guide – because reason regards the glance of the serpent as an emerald As the dragon-like serpent noticed that elderly reason conducted the leadership of the caravan, it became dejected, despised, and discouraged In that ocean (of the world) the serpent

was like the crocodile forming a bridge under the feet of reason Its poison turned into sugar, its thorn into a rose It was a highway robber, but it grew to be a guide It was a cause of fear, but it grew to be the cause of security 72
As mentioned earlier, it is frequently a serpent that has the power to confer supernatural knowledge of the manṭiq al-ṭair, the language of birds, upon a human being The mystics see this as the language of the soul, an interpretation of the Qurʾānic verse (sūra 27, 16–9) which mentions that Sulaymān understood the speech of the birds, so becoming, in mystical terms “the shaykh who converses in the secret language of the soul with his disciples ”73 The medieval Jewish philosopher yehuda HaLevi of Toledo (c 1080–1140) explains in the Kuzari (4, 25; with reference to the anonymous Sefer Yezirah (“Book of Creation,” 4, 2) that while the dragon (teli) also has an astrological/astronomical significance; it serves above all as an allegory for veiled metaphysical aspects of the universe and hidden mysteries which cannot be grasped:
The Teli in the world is like a king in his province, the heart in the soul is like a king at war Teli is the name of the juzhar [jawzahr]; by this word one understands the world of the intellect because through the juzhar one denotes hidden things which are not comprehended by the senses 74
The dragon thus serves as mystical vehicle and symbol in the path to spirituality, mystical revelation and finally an enlightened state of being 75 In consequence, the dragon that was seen to guard a worldly treasure can readily be transformed by the mystic into the dragon that guards divine and heavenly treasures 76 An interesting literary allegory attesting to the validity of this notion over a long period of time
is found in the so-called Hymn of the Pearl,77 composed before the end of the Parthian-Arsacid period in 224 ad78 in or not far from Edessa (now known as Urfa) 79 The hymn, which recounts the story of the quest for a unique pearl guarded by a dragon, might reveal further aspects of the treasure-guarding dragon which are still relevant conceptualisations in Central Asia and the Near East in early medieval times The protagonist, who identifies himself as the son of the “King of Kings, the great king of the East,” recounts how he was sent as a young prince by his parents from their Eastern kingdom to Egypt (representing here the dark demonised world),80 to recover a precious pearl that lay on the sea bed, encircled by a giant hissing dragon 81 The latter appears here as ruler of the sea and guardian of a treasure In spite of the prince’s efforts to disguise himself from the Egyptians lest they recognise him as a stranger and arouse the dragon against him, he is recognised in Egypt, savours the food and falls asleep in the “dragon’s inn ” Only when he receives a letter from his parents, which flies to him in the form of an eagle, is he reminded of his mission He instantly puts the dragon to sleep by a charm, snatches the pearl and makes a triumphant return to the kingdom in the east There he dons the glittering royal robe he used to wear as a child and, like a mirror, it permits him to recognise his royal self and be reunited with it 82 The pearl in the Hymn of the Pearl can be seen as a symbol of the soul itself The story thus presents in allegorical form the Gnostic doctrine of the soul’s heavenly origin and salvation through gnosis 83 The prince is represented not only in the traditional guise of a hero on a quest, but also as a seeker on a spiritual journey 84 The metaphorical use of the pearl as “soul, spiritual power, substance” is attested in the Iranian tradition 85 The dragon that guards this soul-pearl has to be

charmed before gnosis can be attained The importance of the Hymn of the Pearl in the Iranian sphere is, moreover, documented by the fact that it is later appropriated by the Manichaeans 86 As Simo Parpola demonstrates, the story has no apparent Greek, Christian or Jewish parallels, but it is closely paralleled by several Mesopotamian myths that were popular in the Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian and Persian periods 87 It is interesting to consider the Parthian allegorical epic in the light of the mystical traditions of the medieval Islamic period Analogous ideas are expressed in Niẓāmī’s Haft Paykar in which the motif of the treasure-guarding dragon plays an important part in the biographical journey of the fifth-century Sasanian ruler Bahrām Gūr (the sobriquet Gūr, or onager (a wild ass) referring to his prowess at hunting; 420–438) from birth to death 88 The pattern of Bahrām’s life likewise recalls that of a mythic hero who must pass successive tests to prove his worth In the first of four linked exploits an onager (gūr) of extraordinary beauty, described as a spiritual form (paykar-i rūḥānī), leads the prince to the mouth of a remote cave before which lies a terrible dragon that guards a treasure 89 The dragon, which has devoured the onager’s foal, is slain by the mighty hunter and its belly slit open, whereupon the foal emerges unharmed and leads Bahrām to the discovery of the treasure, a necessary step on his path to kingship 90 The story thus follows the convention of the heroic epic in which a quest must be undertaken to recover a stolen treasure from a dragon The first and last episodes repeat the same motif, the undertaking of the spiritual quest that anticipates Bahrām’s fourth trial, the final hunt, which represents the end of his symbolic journey Again he is guided by an onager to a remote cave in which lies a deep water-filled chasm, into which the king plunges on horseback, “consigning the kingly treasure to the cave ” He vanishes to become one with the “Companion of
the Cave” (yār-i ghār), an allusion to the historical journey of the Prophet Muḥammad from Mecca to Medina during which he found refuge in a cave with the first caliph, Abū Bakr, thus completing the cycle 91 The king so transcends the material limits of life on earth, and the treasure is transformed into ultimate spiritual perfection 92 The mystical poet and thinker Farīd al-Dīn ʿAṭṭār (c 537/1142–3–617/1220), who was born in Nīshāpūr, also alludes to the dragon’s implicit association with spirituality:
you are a treasure of spirituality and where your treasure is, there is the dragon 93
The dragon is thus experienced as a stage or threshold which functions not as an end but as a healing, transforming way station not only for a more harmonious inner and social life but also as a symbol that could lead to a distinct and higher vision of the absolutely transcendent Divine In a passage of the Mathnawī, Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī similarly describes the dragon as guarding the treasure, the hidden essence:
Wherever men put a big lock, that is a sign that there is to be found something precious and valuable So you see the greater the veil the better the element Just as a snake is over the treasure, so do you not regard our ugliness, but regard the precious things of the treasure 94
This “hidden treasure” guarded by the dragon is the heart of man, the centre of his spiritual physiognomy 95 The pivotal role accorded to the dragon in the journey of transformation is allegorically expressed by the poet and mystic Mawlānā Nūr al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Jāmī (817/1414–898/1492), born in Khardjird near Herat, in his dīwān:
The teeth of the key [which open the treasure chest] Are the teeth of the dragon 96

The immense cultural significance of the serpentdragon is best demonstrated by the fact that its iconography was known and exploited throughout Western Asia in the medieval period Moreover, it was not restricted to just one religious creed Jews, Christians, Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus and others were equally ready to employ its likeness in textual and visual sources while contributing, each in their own way, to the broad repository of dragon and serpent iconography A wide semantic range of serpent-dragon iconography and iconology evolved during its immemorial history in Western Asia Textual and visual sources reflect the quintessential ambiguity of such imagery Animated by the endless interplay of dichotomous forces the creature revealed itself as deliverer or destroyer, regenerator or annihilator, protector or adversary The dragon thus served to embody the eternal opposition of two distinct forces, one seeking to preserve life, the other to destroy it, a polarity giving rise to a kaleidoscopic diversity of function and symbolism The serpent-dragon accrued a range of negative aspects following changes brought about by the rise of Zoroastrian cosmological dualism A more robust symbolism was needed and the inherently powerful and combative serpentdragon aptly came to represent the Zoroastrian evil spirit who declares to God: “I shall destroy you and your creatures forever and ever And I shall persuade all your creatures to hate you and to love me ”1 In its new guise the dragon thus assumed the mantle of eschatological opponent, the evil principle who would be destroyed, following a millennium of conflict, in a final battle
that would usher in a new age and a new creation Serpents and dragons thus came to be classed as noxious beings (khrafstras), creatures of the “hostile spirit” Ahriman and as such evil and deserving of death In spite of this the Greek writer Philo of Byblos (c 64–141) records a saying of the magus Zoroaster/Zarathushtra according to which the serpent is not only immortal but “the director of everything beautiful ... the best of the good, the wisest of the wise ... the father of order and justice, self-taught ... and perfect and wise ...”2 The link between these statements and historical Iranian Zoroastrianism seems tenuous Nevertheless, as well as reflecting the Hellenistic reception of Zoroastrian ideas they may suggest that the Iranian definition of the serpentdragon as unequivocally maleficent was perhaps not always as cut and dried as appears from surviving scriptures 3 The serpent-dragon’s association with the mysteries of birth and death is echoed in Philo’s monograph Ethothion (now lost but preserved in excerpts by Eusebius) in which he claims that “it is immortal and ... dissolves into itself ...; for this sort of animal does not die an ordinary death unless it is violently struck ”4 The serpent is known to be the animal most filled with the breath of life (pneuma) 5 Its connection with life is further suggested by the possible association of various terms for “serpent” with those of “life,” traceable especially in Aramaic and Arabic The case for tracing such serpent names (ḥiwyaʾ and ḥayya respectively) back to the root ḥyw, apparent in the word ḥay[w]āt (“life”),6 as described by Ibn Manẓūr in the Lisān al-ʿArab,7 was explored above in chapter 14 Such an etymology would elucidate the drag

on’s affinity with symbols of fertility and fecundity in the vegetal world, which often spring from its mouth (hence are associated with his breath, saliva and tongue), as well as, by extension, its guardianship of treasures hidden in the earth and the sources of nature’s abundance At the same time the serpent-dragon is known as the awful dragon of death In medieval writings reference to its gaping mouth (as well as its breath or saliva) frequently alludes metaphorically to impending calamity It manifests particular power in times of great danger, whether natural phenomena such as storm, flood or drought, or aspects of the heavens such as an eclipse, which may usher in calamity or disease The dragon’s association with the heavens was further underlined through its identification with astronomical and astrological manifestations Its manifestly dual nature confers on the serpent-dragon an intermediate status The worldencircling ouroboros marks the boundary between the ordered world and the chaos around it and thereby appears itself as exponent of liminality situated upon the ambiguous dividing line between the divine and the demonic Thus intrinsically linked with the idea of the threshold, dragon imagery appears around entrances and portals of secular and religious architectural monuments, where it serves as liminal marker and apotropaic device in the role of a guardian imbued with prophylactic and talismanic power, warding off the dangers inherent in such places It has also been shown that a visual hybridisation resulted from a conflation of the dragon with other animals, mythical creatures or vegetation This fusion draws two juxtaposed principles together into a unified being, so creating a duality which simultaneously contrasts and fuses two opposites These composites reflect an amalgamation not only of external, that is physical, but also of internal, that is innate, characteristics This hybridisation finds an interesting parallel in the motif of the human face, animal head, vegetal ornament or benedictory inscription flanked by two dragon heads The visual pairing of the monstrous heads is an example of the conceptual doubling aspect of representations so prominent throughout the medieval period, a device intended to reinforce and augment the visual impact and potency of the symbol This symbolism of gaping dragons’ jaws flanking a central motif, which also entails an astrological aspect, similarly affords a glimpse into the process of conflating two prin
ciples This arresting visual trope serves as a shorthand, alluding to the act whereby the dragon has issued or will devour the central element The processes of issuing and devouring are thereby intrinsically linked In both the dragon nature is merged with that of the central motif The outcome of this synthesis is probably to be seen as empowering The imagery of the dragon heads flanking a central motif thus may be presumed to represent a beneficial iconography, serving as powerful apotropaic device The association of the serpent with healing powers and in turn with magic is well-known as evidenced, for example, in the classical and Punic world by its symbolic relationship with Asklepios or in the magical abilities of Thrita and Thraētaona, the earliest healers of Iranian mythology, whose invention of an antidote for snake poison is paralleled by their heroic dragon-fighting feats The same symbolism could be associated with Moses raising the bronze serpent in the wilderness to heal the victims of a plague of serpents Mounted on a pole, the serpent serves as antidote to death This homeopathic principle was a frequently employed tool, also serving Iskandar according to al-Masʿūdī, when marine dragons obstructed the building of the city of Alexandria The principle of similia similibus curantur involving the dragon is complemented by that of transforming alchemy In the symbolism of medieval Islamic alchemy paired interlaced dragons illustrate the fundamental polarity on which the cosmic rhythm is based, the solve et coagula of the alchemical process The dragon here serves to embody the circular nature of the alchemical process and the agency of transformation that both devours and restores On yet another level Abū Maslama Muḥammad al-Majrītī represents this in his treatise Ghāyat al-ḥakīm as the opposing principles of positive and negative bodily temperaments which are associated with the two celestial nodes (knots), the head and the tail of the “hidden essence ” The dragon can also be said to function as a representative of the unknown, often conceived of as hostile and threatening Resistant to rationalising and civilising influences, it came to represent wicked foreign tyrants, a paramount example being the hominoid dragon Ẓaḥḥāk of Iranian mythology who was turned into a historicised political entity, presumably blending spheres of history and mythology yet the frequent use of the dragon simile in panegyrics addressed to heroes and rulers reflects at the same time both the numinous fear and the

reverential awe that the creature evoked The potency of the dragon, emblematised on paraphernalia of heroism and rulership such as banners or articles of personal adornment, relies on the same combination of fear and awe, while drawing particularly on the implicit semantics of the dragon iconography as protective and beneficial The significance accorded to the dragon figure is underscored by the fact that, as repeatedly noted above, it was singled out as monstrous paradigmatic adversary This fundamental juxtaposition between victor and vanquished dragon adversary may in large part result from the influence of Iranian dualist notions on the religions of the Near East In many ways the treatment of the great opponent also reveals a polemical trend The Hebrew Bible represented pagan kings such as Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 51 34) with the likeness of the tannin,8 while in Christian imagery the dragon assumed an overall meaning as symbol and instrument of a diabolical force9 as visually attested, for instance, in the eleventh- or early twelfth-century Byzantine encyclopaedia of the Metaphrastian Menologion volumes, featuring “revenge miniatures” employed for purposes of politico-religious propaganda Dragon imagery thus became a significant tool in the ongoing polemic against earlier cults Nonetheless, as has been shown, numerous examples of such imagery survived the repressions and official mutations of ancient beliefs These survivals testify to the strength of a complex immemorially ancient heritage of traditions, rituals, beliefs and legends that circulated in the medieval Western Asian world and beyond They illuminate the deep-rooted potency as well as fluidity and eminent adaptability of the dragon iconography, which lent itself to constant renewal and to the revival of ancient associations More than this, the survival of this imagery also reflects popular belief in contrast to official religious and political ideology, revealing fundamental differences between two mentalities, sensibilities and needs On the one hand there is the ruling religious and political elite, claiming the triumph of good over evil and imposing an ideology which dictates clearly delineated bound
aries On the other there is the traditional culture of popular folkloric belief shared by the general populace Faced with the terrifying ambiguity of the dragon nature, natural prudence suggests that pacification is the wisest course Ancient thoughtpatterns, equivocal, artful and at times even magical, offer the possibility of rendering the dragon inoffensive and possibly even releasing its beneficial aspect The enemy symbolised by a dragon is presented as formidable but generally vanquished yet the nature of the eminent monster is such that it can only be subdued by a warrior, frequently represented as horseman, endowed with supernatural powers and by miraculous means This imagery was used in Sasanian political propaganda at the investiture relief of Ardashīr I (r 224–241) at Naqsh-i Rustam and likewise employed and adapted in Jewish, Christian or Islamic contexts Often however the fight with the dragon was not a duel to the death, as frequently shown particularly in political or eschatological contexts, but a taming of the creature The intent was to neutralise and contain the terrifying and equivocal forces inherent in the dragon rather than to annihilate them At this juncture it is important to emphasise that the intrinsic as well as extrinsic ambiguity of the serpent-dragon also entails an element of transcendence, necessarily so since the creature’s mystery can only be explained as flowing from the juxtaposition of two or more levels of reality In essence, then, it defies understanding The cosmic aspect of the dragon, which sometimes surfaces, involves also a sacred dimension; it is interesting to note that the Latin term sacer means both sacred and wretched or cursed Its inherent duality makes of the dragon image an embodiment of change and transformation, and consequently at times a cipher of upheaval Such associations extend the dragon’s semantic territory as agent of fertility and fecundity into the realm of spiritual fertilisation Often however the great beast serves as metaphor for spiritual realities whose meanings are obscured or veiled Another aspect of the hero’s combat with the dragon can thence be observed in the transforma

tion of the mythical warrior into a new kind of spiritual warrior (fātā) The combat which takes place on an external mythical ground – symbolised by the fight with the dragon – could on another level be considered a personal spiritual struggle (jihād) against one’s lower self, a process which was deemed to be more meritorious than physical struggle 10 The Bāb al-Ṭilasm dragon relief in Baghdad was built under the supervision of the ʿAbbasid caliph al-Nāṣir li-Dīn Allāh who distinguished himself by trying to develop the organisation of the classical Islamic futuwwa brotherhoods (which were closely associated with and gradually assimilated ṣūfi traditions)11 and who was dedicated to becoming a “caliph of unity ”12 The representations of the ruler between two dragons, as emblematised in the Bāb al-Ṭilasm relief, show him taming the awesome forces of the dragons The resonance and complexity of the imagery offered al-Nāṣir the possibility of enhancing his reputation on multiple levels The caliph acquired by association the mythical power, strength and authority of the dragons he had subdued At the same time, the scene suggested a spiritual interpretation: portrayed as fātā the caliph’s harnessing of the dragons’ might can be seen to stand as a symbol of his personal spiritual jihād The Bāb al-Ṭilasm relief thus exemplifies the way in which the users of such imagery were able to draw on many potential levels of meaning,
evoking complex and subtle ideas and responses Finally, it is important to recall the significance accorded to the great serpent in the legendary Islamicised prophetic tales, based on the authority of learned men from the early years of Islam but recorded only from the eleventh century onwards Related by the quṣṣāṣ al-ʿāmm (“narrators for the common folk”) who enjoyed great success with popular audiences, the tales reveal the extraordinary aura that surrounded the fabulous beast Not only was the great serpent said to encircle the divine Canopy, but it was singled out to:
...greet [the] Prophet Muḥammad on the night of his ascent into heaven and give him glad tidings concerning himself and the community 13
Even if the present study necessarily represents no more than a brief episode in the immemorial history of “one of the most complex symbolisms of the history of cultures,”14 it is hoped that some of the deep layers of the dragon iconography, hinted at in narratives such as this, have been uncovered in these pages The investigation of a wide variety of visual and textual dragon references across different cultural, confessional, geographical and chronological spheres may also illuminate and reflect the way in which medieval man perceived himself, in his interaction with such a potent and enigmatic symbol

a East-west exchange and the metamorphosis of dragon imagery
The first part of the Epilogue explores the dragon imagery as potent symbol of cross-cultural connection and artistic exchange during the Mongol era in general and the Ilkhanid period in particular In the Mongol visual arts, including coinage, sculptural and architectural elements, as well as in manuscript illustrations, the dragon appears in different stylistic guises as elements of Chinese and Western Asian derivation combine, testifying to the meeting and merging of cultural elements from east and west and providing evidence of early acculturation in the development of an Ilkhanid idiom The breadth of the emerging dragon iconography is illustrated in the text and illustrations of Ilkhanid manuscripts More than any other creature, the dragon is identified with China,1 also known as the land of Chīn (al-Sīn in the Arabised form), Khitay or Cathay 2 One consequence of the Mongol invasions and subsequent Mongol hegemony was a westward movement of the arts that led to the introduction of stylistic aspects of East Asian (mostly Chinese and Chinese-inspired Mongol) derivation,3 which include the motif of the dragon Surviving portable and monumental art from the Ilkhanid realm, in particular the tile decoration of the royal residence at Takht-i Sulaimān and the grand illustrated copy of the most important single historical source for the Mongol empire, Rashīd al-Dīn Ṭabīb’s Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh (“Com
pendium of Chronicles”) produced in 714/13145, bear eloquent witness to this phenomenon Temüjin, the leader of a small Mongol tribe, became a conqueror of the eastern part of Mongolia by defeating the Kereit ruler Ong Khān in 1203 Having been proclaimed Supreme Chief of all Mongols in 1206, Genghis Khān and his armies swiftly vanquished a vast area of the Asian continent which included most of Eurasia from the China Sea to the banks of the Dnieper Central Asia, in the widest geographic interpretation of the term, was thus for the first time united under a single ruler and Genghis Khān was said to have carried out God’s will as decreed by divine revelation in becoming master of the world 4 When Genghis died in 1227, the Great Mongol Empire (Mong yeke mongghul ulus) was divided into various khānates (appanages) ruled over by his descendants The Great Khāns (qaghans), Möngke (r 1251–1260) and Qubilay (r 1260–1294), both descendants of Genghis Khān’s youngest son Toluy, ruled Mongolia and northern China as the yuan dynasty (1271–1368) from their capitals, first at Qaraqorum in Mongolia and later at Khānbāliq (lit “City of the Khāns,” Chin Dadu, now known as Beijing) in China They were supported by three collateral principalities: the Golden Horde, descended from Genghis Khān’s eldest son Juchi in most of Russia; the Chaghatayids, descended from Genghis’s second son Chagatay, in the region from the Aral Sea to the Altai mountains; and the Ilkhans descended from Hülegü/Hūlāgū, in Western Asia

The control of most of Asia by the Mongols, the so-called Pax Mongolica, marked an increase in trade and cultural transmission between the Mongol empire in China and Central Asia and also led to the introduction of accoutrements associated with the nomadic culture of the Mongols Among these are a group of twelfth- and thirteenth-century dragon-handled cups, or beltbowls, both in silver and gold, mostly found among grave goods distributed over a wide geographical region 5 A well-known example is the thirteenth-century gold dragon-handled cup, or dipper, which is part of the Siberian Collection of Peter the Great (fig 182) 6 The cup’s relief-cast handle is rendered in the form of a horizontally-projecting scaly serpentine ‘neck’ rearing up and terminating in an outwardoriented dragon head with flowing mane and curled up snout which attaches to the rim The head has a short snout, a ribbed upper lip and shorter, curved, lower lip; a gold ring is held in the clenched jaws The small eyes may have been set with stones that are now missing The beard hair projecting from the rounded flews terminates in curls An angular gold wire extends from the dragon’s forehead to the lip of the bowl An inscription on the bottom of the cup in the
“Turkic” literary language in cursive script connects it to the Ulus Juchi (Golden Horde, descended from Genghis Khān’s eldest son Juchi whose centre was located in the Volga Basin in the Qıpchaq steppe) The inscription reads: “In the year since the Prophet Muḥammad went from Mecca to Medina six hundred seventeen [years of the lunar calendar] have passed ” The date corresponds to 1220–1 It is however probable that the inscription was added at a later date This type of cup was developed in the northern regions of China and Mongolia as exemplified by vessels made in the states ruled by non-Han (i e nonCentral Plain) Chinese tribes such as the Liao (916–1125) and Jin dynasties (1115–1234) 7 The shallow drinking vessel seems to have been designed as a portable container which could be carried by travellers suspended from a belt or saddle by the loop formed by the dragon’s protome 8 Belts set with depictions of the dragon are known to have been produced in the steppe regions of northern China from at least the Western Jin period (265–316) 9 The large number of excavated Qitan-Liao-period belt/strap fittings and harness ornaments with dragon motifs10 moreover indicate that the dragon motif was well

established on the accoutrements of the steppe culture that extended far beyond Mongolia After the demise of the Qitan state of Liao in China, part of the Qitan nobility, who were most probably distant descendants of the eastern branch of the Xianbei tribal confederacies, moved westwards to Chinese Turkestan With the help of the Uighurs, to whom they were related, they created between 1128 and 1133 the Qara-Qitai (“Black Qitan”) state in the Ili Valley, which after their victory over the Saljuq Turks in 1141 near Samarqand stretched over a vast area of Central Asia as far as the northern bank of the Āmū Daryā (known to the Arabs as the Jayḥūn, “flood”) With the expansion of the Qitan, some of their iconographic expressions also moved westwards into Central Asia In 1206 Genghis Khān marched westwards with the main body of his army, progressively taking over the Tangut kingdom, and the empire of the Qara-Qitai, who submitted to the authority of the Great Khān and were with time assimilated by the local population Qara-Qitai, Jurchen, Uighurs, Qarluqs, Qıpchaqs and Chinese were already fighting on the side of the Great Khān in the victorious war against the Khwārazm-shāh ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Takash (596/1200617/1220) According to Mark Kramarovsky, it follows from the description of the military gear of Jalair Mukhali (d 1223) that the saddle and horse trappings of Genghis Khān and his elite night guard (kebteuls), the most privileged military unit of the Mongol army, were decorated with dragons 11 The workmanship and, perhaps, the choice of the motif are thought to have been influenced by the Qitan and Jurchen to the northeast of China 12 Kramarovsky suggests that the conscious choice of the dragon as unifying heraldic symbol, reserved for the “emperor” and his elite guards, was formed in the period between 1204 to 1206 and 1217 to satisfy the needs of a rapidly growing new elite 13 In 1221 the widespread occurrence of the dragon symbol was observed by the Chinese traveller Chang Chun during his visit to Bianjing
(now Kaifeng), the former capital of the Tungusic Jurchen of the Jin dynasty 14 Early Mongol battle and parade belts and belt buckles with depictions of dragons are known from archaeological finds brought by the first generation of Jurchids as early as the 1220s to 1240s to the European steppe zone, pertaining to finds in the Dnieper region, the Middle Don region, the steppes of the Caucasus foreland and the Middle and Lower Volga regions 15 According to Kramarovsky, the first stratum of gilded and nielloed silver belts with heraldic dragons may be assigned to the second half of the twelfth century and the first half of the thirteenth century Of a complete belt found at Krasnoyarskoye archaeological site in the vicinity of Astrakhān, which would have consisted of 65 to 70 elements, 29 parts survive, many carrying the emblem of a dragon (fig 183) 16 The type and style of this belt, which is Central Asian in origin, dates from the time of the formation and the flourishing of the single Mongol state 17 The elite night guard belonged to the elder generation of the officer corps of the Jurchids who arrived in the European part of the steppes around the middle of the thirteenth century and had disappeared by the late fourteenth century 18 Among these finds is a so far unrecognised composition It appears on a belt head and expresses the ancient Central Asian conceptualisation of the “Master of the Dragons” as the dragon-tamer The almost universal currency of the motif throughout the Central Asian world is underscored by its use on this accoutrement of rectangular outline with arched ends It shows a frontally rendered figure with mask-like face, punctuated by small, almond-shaped eyes, angular nose, large open mouth and with large protruding ears, grasps with extended arms the necks of two imposing rampant dragons, holding them at bay (fig 184) 19 Although the remarkably fluid rendering of the dragons with their long pointed horns owes much to the Chinese canon of these fabulous beasts, it is used here in a typically Central Asian configuration that was not prevalent in the Chinese empire Given its evident corre

spondence with imagery relating to the overmastering of the dragon, this iconography can be assumed to have been implicitly imbued with favourable properties, possibly of an empowering quality, which would in turn be passed on to the owner of the buckle At the same time it is a sign of supremacy and of victory over untamed forces The frequent application of the dragon motif on accoutrements pertaining to a traditional nomadic lifestyle, moreover, suggests that it was not only well-known but firmly enshrined in Mongol mythological concepts and formed an integral part of their artistic repertoire even before the onset of the period of Mongol imperial rule The fact that belief in a dragon played a significant part in the indigenous beliefs of the Mongols (see below), lends added weight to this possibility 20 Two years after Genghis Khān’s death in 1227, his third son and designated successor, Ögödei, was confirmed as the second Great Khān (r 12291241) From 641/1243–4 until 653/1255–6 his territories in greater Khurasan were overseen by governor Arghūn Āqā, who was part of the Oirat Mongol clan 21 It was under him that in 642/1244–5 the Mongols minted their first silver coins in Arrān (the district in Transcaucasia between the Kur and Aras rivers) Not least because of the turbulent political situation in Khurasan, Arghūn chose to retain the area of Azerbaijan as one of the centres of Mongol monetary production 22 It is significant that for the iconography of these first coins, the Mongols chose that of the dragonfighting horseman The latter is portrayed as a galloping archer in Mongol attire turning to aim over his shoulder at a “Saljuq-style” ophidian dragon The arched inscription above, written in the Turkic language but in Arabic script, states: “Ūlūgh Mūnqūl ulūsh nyk/One great Mongol nation ” Coins of this type were chosen for different principalities such as Ganja, the capital of
Arrān, and Nakhchavān 23 In their quest for legitimacy, the Mongols may well have given serious consideration to their choice of the motif of the mounted archer and dragon as a symbol of “inherited” sovereignty, using it as a means of propagating their ideological formula The image here represents a victorious mounted archer in Mongol dress, combined with the traditional imagery of the dragon-fighting horseman that was easily recognisable throughout Western Asia Another important form of dragon symbolism, that of the tree with dragons, had made an appearance in thirteenth-century Mongolia in the form of an automaton During Ögödei’s time the designated capital of the empire at Qaraqorum in the Orkhon valley in central Mongolia, chosen by his father as early as 1220, was walled and, according to the Yüan-shih (“History of the yuan dynasty”), the official history of the yuan dynasty composed in the early Ming dynasty, Ögödei constructed a palace there in 1235 24 In the imperial precinct his son Möngke erected a serpent-tree, which became a monument of central significance At his orders it was built in the form of a large, gilded silver tree-fountain by the French silversmith Guillaume Bouchier, a prisonerof-war, together with fifty local workmen 25 The serpent-tree-fountain was of considerable size and was situated in the southern section of the main reception hall of the Khān’s palace called Tumen Amgalant (“Myriad Tranquillities”) opposite the Khān’s throne 26 During Möngke’s reign the Franciscan friar, William of Rubruck (Willem van Ruysbroeck, c 1210–1270) from French Flanders visited the Mongol capital of Qaraqorum in 1254 and in his Itinerarium addressed to king Louis IX of France gives a detailed account of this silver tree-fountain:

In the entry of this great palace, it being unseemly to bring in there skins of milk and other drinks, master William the Parisian had made for him a great silver tree, and at its roots are four lions of silver, each with a conduit through it, and all belching forth white milk of mares And four conduits are led inside the tree to its tops, which are bent downward, and on each of these is also a gilded serpent, whose tail twines round the tree And from one of these pipes flows wine, from another cara cosmos, or clarified mare’s milk, from another bal, a drink made with honey, and from another rice mead, which is called terracina; and for each liquor there is a special silver bowl at the foot of the tree to receive it Between these four conduits in the top, he made an angel holding a trumpet, and underneath the tree he made a vault in which a man can be hid And pipes go up through the heart of the tree to the angel [...] And there are branches of silver on the tree, and leaves and fruit 27
Significantly, the portrayal of the tree with serpents has certain analogies with that of the previously discussed large water-clock automaton described in a medieval Islamic illustrated horological treatise 28 During the medieval Islamic period, automata in the form of silver gilded trees with artificial singing birds were known as expressions of imperial might, particularly in ʿAbbasid times 29 However, the affixing of the four gilded serpent ducts from which flow four different types of liquid appears to be a unique feature which must have been meaningful to Möngke Khān and his entourage, according to whose orders the prestigious serpent-tree was designed and placed at the most central location in the palace facing the Khān’s throne Related imagery may be sought in popular tradition and folklore However since any diffusion of narratives took place largely through oral transmission before finding crystallisation in the literary world, it is interesting to regard oral epics popular in Central Asian folklore (which were recorded as late as the nineteenth century) as possible carriers that transmitted and thereby preserved remnants of the age-old visual concept of a tree with roots reaching the underworld guarded
by a serpent or dragon Such symbolism appears, for instance, in the Qirghiz cycle of Er Töshtük, in which the hero must make a mystical journey into the underworld There he finds an elm tree whose trunk reaches through the centre of the earth, the tree’s crown reaching to the sky with a dragon coiled around its base He rescues the young of an eagle by cutting the monstrous creature in half To show her gratitude the mother eagle swallows Er Töshtük and then disgorges him, transformed and rendered invulnerable, and after that carries him up again to the land of the living 30 It is of note that under Möngke’s reign the building of an important Buddhist temple with central stūpa was completed in Qaraqorum 31 During excavations at the site a thirteenth- or fourteenth-century copper alloy matrix for a double vajra (“thunderbolt”) was found 32 A concept similar to that seen on the above examples also governs the depictions on the matrix: from each of the arms of the cross grow a pair of dragon protomes that support the pyramidal jewels, representing the sacred Mount Meru as the centre The symbolism on the matrix attests to the universality of the various manifestations of the serpent-tree-cross iconography revealing, to a great extent, a unified tradition throughout the Central Asian world, which shares certain basic beliefs 33 William of Rubruck’s journey to Mongolia coincided with the fresh wave of extensive military campaigns launched by Hülegü (r 654/1256663/1265), Möngke’s younger brother and expeditionary commander, across Central and Western Asia The future founder of the Ilkhanate led the main body of the Mongol army across the Oxus river and onto the Iranian plateau His eldest son, Abāqā, the future second Ilkhan, who was born in Mongolia in 1234, accompanied him In 654/1256 the grandson of Ghengis Khān overcame the Shīʿa Muslim state of the Ismāʿīlīs (the Assassins) ensconced in northwestern Iran and in 652/1258 brought the ʿAbbasid caliphate in Baghdad to a violent end Thus establishing their hegemony over most of West Asia, the Ilkhanid dynasty ruled over Mesopotamia, Iran, Western

Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and parts of Asia Minor, from 654/1256 to 754/1353 Hülegü took the title Ilkhan and continued his allegiance to the throne of the Great Khān in China, his brother Möngke 34 The ensuing close relationship of symbolic and commercial ties between the Mongol court in China and the Ilkhanid court created an environment of extraordinary cultural exchange in the form of gifts,35 tribute36 and merchandise,37 moving in both directions between China and Western Asia Life at the yuan court became an “absolute model to the Ilkhans, who tried to emulate the Great Khāns in their courtly life, conducting many of their private and official affairs in the Mongolian fashion of their ancestral homeland ”38 yuan China’s art thus affected and informed the visual expressions of the Ilkhanate which was characterised by the transmission of Chinese and Chinese-inspired Mongol motifs The blurring of the boundaries between what constitutes a “Chinese,” a “Mongol” or, more broadly, a “Central Asian” style is of course the outcome of a fluidity of cultural modes (expressed in material culture), representing a long-lasting and more or less continuous state of acculturation and appropriation between different ethnic and cultural groups Some of the Mongols who had invaded Western Asia had been Nestorian Christians (in particular their wives),39 but the majority followed the indigenous beliefs of the Mongols which were essentially ancestral animistic and syncretic The cult of Heaven (Tengri) was central to the TurkoMongol system of belief, its beginnings going back to remotest times This concept played a fundamental role in the notion of legitimacy and sovereignty 40 It comprised the veneration of the Sun, in particular the rising Sun, the Moon and the natural phenomena of the heavens in which, as mentioned above, the belief in a dragon played an important role 41 As such, it provided a bridge
to Chinese concepts of cosmology and sovereignty, both being linked by a similar notion of Heaven 42 However in the royal house and among the ruling class there was a tendency towards Buddhism, perhaps as a result of the fairly close relations with China The rulers, Hülegü (r 654/ 1256–663/1265), Abāqā (r 663/1265–680/1282) and his sons Arghūn (r 683/1284–690/1291) and Gaykhātū (r 690/1291–694/1295) were probably Buddhists, hence Buddhism took a central place during the first half of Ilkhanid rule for about forty years (654/1256–694/1295) Consequently elements of Buddhist art and iconography were pervasive, visualised in the many richly endowed Buddhist temples built by the rulers 43 One of the Ilkhanid Buddhist sites is situated in the village of Dashkasan of the district of Viār, probably named after the Sanskrit term vihāra for a Buddhist monastery It is located just outside the Mongol summer quarter Qongqur Öleng (Turk “Brown Meadow”), which later became the imperial city Sulṭāniyya (c 684/1285) near Qazwīn in northwestern Iran founded by Ghāzān’s younger brother and successor Öljeitü (Ūljāytū, r 703/1304–716/1316) At the west wall of the rock-cut complex two monumental, fluidly rendered, quadruped dragons passant with their tails curling between the hind legs and set against undulating foliage are preserved Carved into stone in high relief and flanked by mihrāb-like muqarnas niches, the creatures are an early testimony for the depiction of a Chinese-inspired Mongol dragon (fig 185) 44 The Ilkhanids maintained the nomadic practice of seasonal migrations, moving rythmically according to the time of year from summer (yaylāq) to winter (qishlāq) quarters One of their summer encampments was at Sughūrlūq (Turk “Marmot Meadows”),45 in the Azerbaijan region of present-day Iran It was chosen for its climate,

excellent pasture grounds and, as the Turkic name “place abounding in marmots” suggests, the abundant game, which enabled the Mongols to pursue their favourite pastime of hunting As part of their sedentarisation, the second Ilkhanid ruler, Hülegü’s eldest son and successor, Abāqā (r 663/ 1265–680/1282) began the construction of a summer residence at Sughūrlūq in the 1270s,46 less than fifteen years after the arrival of the Ilkhanids The project was completed under his son Arghūn, who also used the residence to house his imperial treasury 47 The site, later also known as Takht-i Sulaimān (“Solomon’s Throne”), remains the only surviving palatial architectural complex of the Ilkhans for which provenance and date are certain It was built over and incorporated the remains of a pre-existing sanctuary, the important Zoroastrian fire temple of Ādur Gushnasp, the “City of the Warriors’ Fire,” active during the late Sasanian period, indicating that the site was perhaps not only selected for its excellent location but for its associations with ancient Iranian kingship, and was intended to appropriate the early charisma that attached to the site 48 The fire temple is said to have been erected by Kay Khusraw, the third mythical ruler of the Iranian dynasty of the Kayānids According to the philologist Ḥamza al-Iṣfahānī (c 280/893–c 350/961) he killed a dragon called Kūshīd and gave its name to the fire temple he built in the place of Ādur Gushnasp, calling it Kūshīd for Gushnasp (lit “possessing stallions” – thought to be the name of the unknown founder) 49
This apparently conscious selection had a precedent in the Mongols’ choice of capital Thomas Allsen convincingly argues that they “went to great lengths to properly site their capital, Qaraqorum, in the same region as the imperial city of the Türk qaghanate and Uighur empire because they believed that there inhered in that particular locale a special good fortune, a charisma (Turk qut) that would favor their own political enterprise ”50 The site may therefore have been carefully selected in an effort to activate its ancient “spiritual resource” (in Allsen’s words) and thereby generate qut which is also one of the characteristics that identifies a nomadic Inner Asian sovereign as chosen by heaven 51 The strategic positioning of the Ilkhanids was particularly crucial: the Mongolian takeover marked a profound rupture resulting from the destruction of the five hundred year-old ʿAbbasid empire (132/750–656/1258) centred on Baghdad and the demise of the two hundred year-old Saljuq dynasty which ruled over a wide area of Western Asia during the eleventh and twelfth centuries (although it survived in Anatolia until the beginning of the fourteenth century) The radical political change necessarily also brought with it new forms of visual expression It was however in the introduction of mythical creatures of Chinese stylistic derivation, in particular the dragon (long) and the phoenix (fenghuang),52 that Takht-i Sulaimān would have the greatest impact on Iranian art These creatures appear on star-shaped, rectangular and other polygonal glazed revetment tiles on the interior walls of the palatial buildings 53 Excavations show

that the most lavishly decorated areas of Takht-i Sulaimān were situated in the īwān palace hall and the complex of octagonal towers joined to the īwān Various techniques were used for decorating the tiles at Takht-i Sulaimān54 which range from underglaze painting and monochrome glazing to overglaze lustre-painting and lājvardina (Pers lājvard meaning “lapis lazuli”), over- and underglaze (an unusual technique believed to have first been documented at Takht-i Sulaimān) 55 The dragons portrayed on the tile revetments (figs 186a and b) closely resemble the carved Viār dragon, datable probably to the second half of the thirteenth century The creatures’ vitality is vividly conveyed The heads, crowned by fine antlers, show an elongated wide-open snout with curled-up proboscis revealing the deep parallel grooves on the roof of the mouth as well as the sharp fangs and the protruding sinuous tongue Tufts of hair are growing from the nape of the neck The quadruped bodies are densely covered with scales and the muscular raptor-like legs have formidable feet with four unsheathed talons When shown as single entities, the dragons are either rendered regardant with tails raised or coiled, the head facing the expansive tail which is tucked around one of the hind legs Similarly vigorous dragons passant were also carved in relief on the torus moulding of the round capitals that crowned the red sandstone columns, pairs of which stood in each of the eight corners of the south octagon (figs 187a and b) 56 yet although the quadrupeds bear some resemblance to Chinese or Chinese-inspired Mongol renditions of these mythical creatures, the bodies are heavier and the twists are more angular, characteristic of a Central Asian inspiration of the dragon; yet the mode of transmission of the style and conventions of the motif cannot be established with certainty 57
Images of dragons enjoyed wide currency in the Turkic world (figs 165 and 166) and must have been well-known to the Mongols whose cultural interrelationship with the Türk has a long history 58 The legendary beasts are known to have been used as architectural decoration in Mongol cities They make a prominent appearance on the automaton tree mentioned earlier from Möngke’s palace at the first yuan capital in Qaraqorum in Mongolia Thirteenth- and fourteenth-century literary sources also include detailed descriptions of architectural elements carved with images of dragons at the palatial buildings as well as bridges at the second yuan capital Khānbāliq (Dadu) in China prior to its destruction in the 1360s 59 In the summer of 1275 the Venetian merchant traveller Marco Polo (c 1254–c 1324) arrived at the court of Shangdu (in present-day Inner Mongolia), the summer capital of the yuan dynasty, and left an account of the so-called “Cane Palace” which presumably relates to Qubilai’s “Sira Ordu ” He describes it as a temporary structure in the form of a huge tent decorated with sculpted dragons supporting the architraves:
It is stayed on gilt and lackered [sic] columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave, and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the architrave 60
The Italian explorer subsequently also visited the winter court in Khānbāliq and noted that the walls of the Khān’s palace were “adorned with representations of dragons sculptured and gilt ”61 Several palatial cities were erected throughout Mongolia in the thirteenth- or fourteenth-century Sculpted granite dragon protomes were a prominent feature at one of these palatial struc

tures, Kondui Palace in the Transbaikal region, which seems to have developed upon the architectural and spatial arrangement of Ögödei’s palace complex Tumen Amgalant at Qaraqorum The palace was built on a platform, surrounded by double-tiered terraces, the dragon sculpture being set on the upper terrace at intervals of two metres facing outwards Of the 150 dragon sculptures that decorated the terrace, 102 were found during Sergei Kiselev’s archaeological excavations in the 1940s (figs 188 and 189) 62 The excavations revealed traces of conflagration, and it is thought that Kondui Palace was burned to the ground during raids by the Chinese army approximately at the same time as Qaraqorum was destroyed in 1380 It is worthy of note that in contrast to many of the previously discussed examples from Islamic architecture, these dragon sculptures were overall not only highly visible but were in fact integrated into the structural aspects of the palatial architecture often with a supportive function 63 Dragon imagery was therefore well established and had wide currency in Mongol culture In addition, glazed roof tiles, tile terminals (the circular goutou and the triangular-shaped dishui) in particular, with moulded decoration of dragons have been found in many Mongol cities 64 The overall depiction of the dragons on the roof tiles is closely related stylistically to that on the tiles from Takht-i Sulaimān In Chinese culture the dragon (long)65 is one of the oldest, most significant and most pervasive symbols, recognised, according to a twelfth-century reading of the early Han-period account Huainanzi, as an all-encompassing creature, the antecedent of all species:
As for the myriad creatures be they feathered, hairy, scaly or armored, they all find their ancestry in the dragon 66
According to ancient ritual beliefs, particularly favoured in Buddhist and Daoist traditions, dragons are a symbolic expression of fertility and fecundity, able to control rain and, if invoked, to procure rain in agricultural life 67 Far from being a mere symbol of the natural elements, the long also carried imperial affiliations from ancient times 68 This is symbolised not least by the mythologising of the miraculous conception of Gaozu, founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, who was born as the result of his mother’s union with a scaly dragon, a sure sign of a heavenly mandate 69 Already in the Shang shu, one of the major historical works of early Chinese history, the dragon is thought to have been depicted together with “the sun and the moon, the stars and the constellations, the mountains, and the flowery animals on the upper sacrificial robes of the emperor ”70 In spite of this association, dragons were used outside the court context in China before and after the advent of the Mongols Early thirteenth-century Mongols of any rank appear to have worn garments decorated with dragons and phoenixes as witnessed by the Song envoy Peng Daya who recorded his visit to Ögödei’s court in the Heida Shilue (“Summary of the Records of the Tatars”) written in 1237 71 However, beginning with the Chinese Song dynasty (960–1279) the symbol of the dragon became an imperial prerogative and paramount imperial symbol, customarily referring to the “emperor’s person: his body was the dragon body, his hands the claws, his capital the dragon’s pool ”72 The Song and Jurchen Jin dynasties, fol

73 According to the Yüan-shih, the dynastic record of the yuan period, the court prohibits the use of the sun, the moon, dragon and tiger on the decoration of silk and satin fabrics as soon as the yuan dynasty was estabished; a code for the robes and colours of officers issued in 1314 further specified restrictions on “the use of designs using the long with five claws and two horns as well as the feng [phoenix] on robes, vessels, and plates, tents and carts of officers” Allsen, 1997, p 108; Masuya, 1997, p 570; see also eadem, 2002, p 96; Kadoi, 2008, p 22, see also the discussion on p 25 As suggested by Masuya (2002, p 97), “the presence of only four claws on the dragons at Takht-i Sulayman may have expressed the Ilkhan’s respect for the suzerainty of the Great Khans, who claimed for themselves the exclusive use of the five-clawed dragon” 74 Allsen, 2001, p 6 However, very little is known about the presence of Chinese artists and craftsmen in the Ilkhanid
realm It is not clear whether Chinese artists were actually transferred to the Ilkhanid courts and trained local artists or if it was mostly a matter of wide circulation of Chinese textiles, works on paper and other works of art in Western Asia that influenced local artists Masuya, 1997, pp 31–5; Rossabi, 2002, p 35 75 The verses taken from the Shāh-nāma are discussed by Melikian-Chirvani, 1991 and 1997b; and Ghouchani, 1992 Cf Masuya, 1997, pp 377–405 76 Melikian-Chirvani, 1984 and idem, 1991 Cf Kadoi, 2008, p 51 77 Melikian-Chirvani, 1997b, p 155 78 Cf idem, 1991, pp 33–148, and idem, 1997b, p 136 79 Idem, 1997b, p 136 80 Tr Boyle, 1912–37, vol 2, p 402 81 Idem, p 407
lowed in 1314 by the Mongol yuan, similarly adopted this proclamatory use of the theme and made the five-clawed long an exclusively imperial symbol 73 These multicultural symbols were presumably understood by most members of the Ilkhanid court where, according to Allsen, a large group of “Easterners” were also present such as Ongguts, Qitans, Uighurs, Tibetans, Tanguts, Mongols and Chinese 74 The tile revetments were without doubt impressive, expressing the wealth and taste of the Ilkhanids which in turn must have conveyed an awesome message of imperial power Some of the lustre-painted star tiles and lustered and molded frieze tiles of Takht-i Sulaimān include inscriptions with quotations from religious texts, including Qurʾānic verses and ḥadīth, as well as Iranian secular poems and quotations from the epic Shāh-nāma, which by the Ilkhanid period was a recognised cornerstone of Iranian literature 75 In addition to the representation of dragons and phoenixes, the subject matter of the visual decoration comprises depictions of princely or heroic activities The verses taken from scenes of the Shāh-nāma located on the borders of eightpointed lustre-painted tiles and on some of the lustre-painted frieze tiles, are especially noteworthy Melikian-Chirvani has proposed that these inscriptions present an intentional selection of the verses in order to connect Abāqā and his successor Aḥmad Tegüder (r 680/1282–683/1284) with the ancient kings of Iran 76 The text has been modified in at least three cases so that it addresses the second person rather than the third as in the original context, hence directly addressing and thereby integrating the Ilkhanid rulers into the history of Iranian kings 77 The cyclical character of the Shāh-nāma, where heroes and rulers in
one cycle parallel the adventures of heroes and rulers in another, facilitated the inclusion of the Ilkhanid rulers within Iranian legendary history and national epic, arguably symbolising the legitimisation of their presence in the Iranian and more broadly the Western Asian world 78 The cyclical nature of its “historical” destiny has, according to Melikian-Chirvani, made the Shāhnāma a “mirror of destiny” and of the world 79 The eulogies contained in these inscriptions are echoed by those recorded by the minister and historian for the Mongols, ʿAlā al-Dīn ʿAṭa-Malik al-Juwaynī (623/1226–681/1283), in the extensive dynastic history Taʾrīkh-i jahān-gushāy (“History of the World-Conqueror”), sponsored by Hülegü, which begins with the campaigns of Genghis Khān and ends with Hülegü’s own victories in Iran and Mesopotamia in 1256 to 1258 In one of these accounts the future Turkic Khwārazmshāh Jalāl al-Dīn (617/1220–628/1231) has to flee to Shadayk during the struggle for succession En route he engages with a Tatar army, demonstrating a courage that even Rustam, the son of Zāl, could not have mustered To highlight the drama of the moment, Juwaynī quotes from the Shāhnāma:
The captain gave his dragon rein and dust removed Light from the world-80
In his battles with the Mongols, the decisive courage of the sulṭān is further compared to the very deadliest creatures, the lion and the dragon:
a lion of the meadow or a Leviathan of the raging sea 81
The praiseworthy qualities attributed to each beast are here again brought together However once the die was cast and the Mongol army had prevailed, Juwaynī was the first to par

(“House of Afrāsīyāb”) This is related to the epic cycle of the Qarakhanids which celebrates the exploits of Afrāsīyāb who was adopted as ancestor by the founder of the dynasty and was identified with the Turkish hero Alp Er Tonga Maḥmūd al-Kāshgharī, Dīwān Lughāt al-turk, tr Atalay, B , Ankara, 1939–1943, vol 1, pp 41, 159–60, 343, 381, 396, 410, 413–4, 466, 486; vol 3, 149–51, 157, 368, as cited in Mélikoff, 1960, vol 1, p 43 84 Bombaci, 1966, p 39, n 5 85 Simpson, 1985, pp 139–40; Legacy, 2002, cat no 95 86 Naumann, E and R , 1969, p 52, fig 10; Simpson, 1985, fig 15; Masuya, 1997, pp 530–4, fig 6-2-4, pl 215 For a discussion of the representation of Farīdūn on medieval Islamic ceramics and metalwork, see Simpson, 1985, pp 131–49 87 Masuya, 1997, p 539, fig 6-2-6, pl 220 88 Naumann, E and R , 1969, p 51 89 See pp 8, 39, 118, n 71, 119, n 77, 164, 219 90 Masuya (1997, pp 536–7) identifies two tiles made from the same mould: Okayama Shiritsu Oriento Bijutsu-kan (“Okayama Municipal Museum of Near Eastern Art”), catalogue of the collection of the museum, Okayama, 1979, cat no 336; Sotheby’s, Catalogue of Islamic Ceramics, Metalwork, Arms and Armour, Glass and Other Islamic Works of Art, London, April 12, 1976, lot no 103
allel Mongol exploits with those of the formidable hero Afrāsīyāb, a well-known figure in Iranian epic from the Avestan texts to the Shāhnāma, the mythical king of Tūrān (the Central Asian region beyond the Jayḥūn/Āmū Daryā), which after the appearance of the Turks in the sixth century was mostly used in the sense of Turkestan, or the land of the Turks,82 the legendary nemesis of Iran In the Taʾrīkh-i jahān-gushāy, Juwaynī identifies Genghis Khān as the new Afrāsīyāb:
For that king is a male dragon panting for vengeance, A cloud of calamity A mountain of hard rock becomes like a sea of water if It hears the name of Afrāsīyāb 83
Drawing on dragon symbolism to evoke the conqueror Genghis Khān was also part of a rhetoric that indicated a shift in political power and sought to explain the change in political fortune indicated by the metaphor of the portentous transformation of the “male dragon panting for vengeance” into a “cloud of calamity ” Pictorial and textual citations from the history of ancient Iranian kingship were long considered an appropriate subject for the decoration of palatial buildings The inclusion of verses from the epic probably belonged to an established decorative programme, also used, according to the chronicler Ibn Bībī, in 618/1221 to decorate the walls of the palaces of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān ʿAlāʾ

tion on the Takht-i Sulaimān tiles might be considered an important testimony to the meeting and merging of cultural elements from Eastern and Western Asia as well as evidence of early acculturation in the development of an Ilkhanid idiom Both the choice of site for the palace, in its implicit appropriation of a past dynasty’s legacy of power and ancient affiliations with Iranian spiritual strength, and the themes of the tile decoration with Chinese and Iranian symbols of royalty, indicate that the Ilkhanid rulers were trying to enhance their strategic representation Their aim was to communicate the legitimacy and charisma of Ilkhanid rule as well as to accumulate “spiritual,” in other words political, power since for the Mongols “the fashioning of a capital was a statement of material and spiritual riches ”91 Until the adoption of Islam as state religion, the early Ilkhanid calendar was based on the astronomically determined twelve animal cycle of years, the so-called “Chinese-Uighur” calendar, in which the year was perceived as starting in spring and the main unit of time was the alternation between winter and summer encampments 92 According to this system which was well-established in Central Asia, each year is associated with an animal; the cycle comprising rat, buffalo, leopard, rabbit, dragon, serpent, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig 93 In ancient Turkish mythology the two animals of the twelve animal calendar, the serpent (yılan) and the dragon (luu), are related 94 The origin of the animal cycle has been much debated, and it remains uncertain whether it can be associated with a Chinese or Central Asian origin 95 It was used in Khotanese, Sogdian, Buddhist Sanskrit, Tocharian, Gandhāran, and Turkic accounts as well as Chinese where the cycle had taken root during the Tang period 96 Some Ilkhanid-period works of art have been associated with this calendar, such as the identical animal scroll reliefs that adorn either side of the portal façade flanking the top corners of the door of the Gök madrasa in Sivas, where a prominent dragon head projects from amidst the cluster of animal heads (fig 190) The construction
of the madrasa was funded by the powerful vizier of the last period of the Saljuqs of Konya, Fakhr al-Dīn ʿAlī Ṣāḥib Aṭaʾ (d 687/1288–9), in 670/ 1271–2 when the Saljuqs were vassals of the Ilkhanids In the same year two further madrasas were erected in Sivas, the Çifte Minare madrasa commissioned by the Ilkhanid vizier Shams al-Dīn Juwaynī and another madrasa ordered by al-Muẓaffar ibn Hibat-Allāh al-Barujirdī, a private individual of whom only the name is known These were the first Ilkhanid-sponsored buildings in the city, which was the place of residence of the Mongol governors, and reflect the change from Saljuq to Ilkhanid hegemony It is against this background that Fakhr al-Dīn ʿAlī appears to have sought to consolidate his own power base by training a group of Muslim bureaucrats at the Gök madrasa who would support his personal ambitions 97 While the other two Ilkhanid sponsored madrasas are devoid of zoomorphic depictions, it is noteworthy that only on the façade of the madrasa patronised by Fakhr al-Dīn ʿAlī are animal sculptures represented The manner of their articulation however, in tightly grouped clusters projecting from interlaced stems, was not confined to this one site nor to architectural decoration A closely related type of imagery with an assemblage of four interlaced dragon heads appears on a two-dimensional medium, an illumination in a thirteenth-century Armenian collection of sermons illustrated in the monastery of Surb Karapet near Baghesh (Bitlis) (fig 191) The dragon motif similarly makes an appearance on the Sunqur Beg Mosque in Niğde in south-central Anatolia, built in the Saljuq period but restored in 736/1335 by the Ilkhanid governor Sayf al-Dīn Sunqur Ağa during the reign of the last major Ilkhanid sovereign Abū Saʿīd Baḥādur Khān The rectangular side panels that flank the portal are framed by rinceaux of vegetal scrolls which bear animal heads, including dragon heads with “Saljuq-style” snouts (fig 192) Hence, more than fifty years after the construction of the Gök madrasa the iconography of the dragon remained remarkably consistent It is, moreover, noteworthy that zoomorphic creatures, fantastic and nat

uralistic, are depicted in the portals of sacred monuments, such as a madrasa and a mosque As discussed earlier, the placement of the dragon theme relates to its role in protecting the vulnerable zone at the threshold of the monuments representing the liminal or transitory passage, in other words the interface of the exterior with the interior Such use invokes dragon imagery in its apotropaic capacity As guardian of the threshold the dragon is a powerful force to ward off evil and afford protection against any dangerous influences The dragons on the Sunqur Beg Mosque represent rare Ilkhanid-period examples98 which continue a tradition that appears to have begun during the rule of the Saljuqs of Rūm, as evidenced by examples of sacred architecture such as the Ak Mosque (617/1220–634/1237) at Anamur, the Great Mosque (626/1228–9 or later) at Divriği, the “Kiosk Mosque” at Sultan Han (between 629/1232 and 633/1236) near Kayseri, and the Çifte Minare madrasa (before 640/12423) at Erzurum The association of the reliefs on the Gök madrasa with the duodecimal animal cycle that was introduced through the Ilkhanids was first proposed by Ernst Diez 99 This hypothesis was elaborated by Otto-Dorn and is followed by several Turkish authors,100 but has been challenged by Roux who does not believe that this calendar was represented in Islamic art 101 Controversy also surrounds closely related depictions on a tile type found at Takht-i Sulaimān, of which several fragments and complete examples survive 102 The spandrels between upper and lower bands of the lustre-painted square tiles show relief scrolls bearing animal heads among which long-eared dragon heads can perhaps be made out The excavators of Takht-i Sulaimān, Elisabeth and Rudolf
Naumann, as well as Johanna Zick-Nissen similarly associate the depiction with the duodecimal animal cycle 103 Baer explains the motif as a reflection of the legendary talking or wāqwāq tree of the Alexander Romance104 associated also with the Iskandar cycle of the Shāh-nāma,105 which Iskandar is said to have encountered during his travels to the ends of the earth 106 Said to grow in some of the Indian islands, this fabulous tree bears fruits resembling human heads which utter the sound wāqwāq when named The theme recurs frequently in manuscripts of the “Wonders of the World” genre (for instance in the works of the thirteenth-century cosmographer al-Qazwīnī) and is perhaps related to that of the Zaqqūm tree mentioned in the Qurʾān on which demons’ heads grow instead of fruit (sūra 37, 62–8) The iconographic rendering of the Gök madrasa reliefs is closely related to the “inhabited scroll” motif referred to earlier, which may have its origin in Khurasan, where the first datable instance occurs on marble slabs, possibly from a palace of a Ghaznawid sovereign at Ghazna 107 It is therefore conceivable that the animal heads fixed to rinceaux do not illustrate any particular story but reflect, rather, an overall spirit of wonder at the mythical hybrids thought to exist beyond the outer reaches of the known earth and as such imbued with prophylactic and talismanic qualities 108 Until the death of the Great Khān Qubilai (Qūbīlāy) in 694/1295, the Ilkhanids were subordinate to the larger empire of the Great Khān in China This became different when Ghāzān Maḥmūd Khān (r 694/1295–703/1304), the seventh and possibly the greatest Ilkhanid ruler, marked the outset of his reign by officially professing the Muslim faith, when he declared himself pādishāh-i Īrān va Islām (“emperor of Iran and Islam”) 109 The conversion to Islam signalled

the transformation of the Ilkhanids into an Islamic dynasty, perhaps in an effort to secure their power in relation to the Mamlūks in Egypt and to relate themselves historically, ethnically and linguistically to their Muslim subjects Ghāzān underlined the independent status he intended to take by using the title Khān 110 yet in spite of having thus become more independent from the Mongol empire, the Ilkhans seem to have continued to pledge their loyalty at least nominally to the Mongol institution of the yasa, the tribal laws of the Mongols as codified by Genghis Khān, a system that was of singular historical significance to the Mongols even though with the introduction of Islamic law it had de facto lost its validity 111 The conversion of the Ilkhans to Islam dealt, however, a heavy blow to the hitherto friendly relations of the Mongols with Cilician Armenia In the year of Ghāzān Khān’s ascension to the throne, the Cilician king Hetʿum II travelled for nearly two months to the Ilkhanid capital Marāgha, an important centre of Christianity during the Mongol period, in the Azerbaijan region of present-day Iran, to meet the Ilkhan ruler at his ordu (imperial encampment)112 in order to receive investiture and, in turn, to present “great gifts ” He was warmly welcomed and received a gift of royal apparel, which “advertised [his] right to act on behalf of the sovereign,”113 an example of gift exchange or reciprocity as tribute which was central to Mongol imperial society 114 He also successfully petitioned for the rescinding of an order to demolish all Christian churches 115 The kingdom of Cilicia had friendly relations and maintained regular contact with the Mongol court in Qaraqorum and later in Khānbāliq from the mid-thirteenth century Diplomatic relations included several journeys of Armenian princes and kings to the Mongol and Ilkhanid courts and lasted until Ghāzān Khān’s death in 703/1304 116
Even before Hetʿum’s travel to the Ilkhanids in 1295, depictions of dragons in Armenian manuscripts had acquired stylistic aspects that are characteristic of Chinese and Chinese-inspired Mongol art, reflecting the influence of representations on Chinese silks and other works of art that were imported to Cilicia 117 Visual evidence of the relations between the Mongol court and their Armenian vassals can already be clearly detected at least a decade earlier in the example of the illuminated lectionary ordered by Hetʿum II and copied and illustrated in Cilicia in 1286 118 The spandrels of the trilobed arch of the headpiece of folio 334 are filled with a dragon-and-phoenix motif (fig 193) The dragon is here shown incorporating some Chinese-derived conventions such as the formidable paws with four unsheathed claws and the undulating tail tucked under one of the hind legs The soaring phoenix is rendered with outspread wings with delineated plumage and slender fanned tail, its head portrayed with the distinctive curved beak turned upwards to face the dragon’s head Paired together the mythical creatures became symbols of imperial sovereignty in yuan China and were as such probably deemed appropriate symbols for members of the Armenian imperial family, perhaps Hetʿum’s parents, Levon and Keran 119 The depiction also reflects the fascination with imaginary animals of Far Eastern derivation An example of the direct appropriation of the image of the Chinese dragon can be seen in the donor portrait of Archbishop John (yovhannes), the half-brother of the Cilician king Hetʿum I, in the Gospel he commissioned in 1289 The lower hem of his tunic carries an appliquéd piece of cloth embellished in gold with a standing Chinese dragon, the head with gaping mouth in profile, all outlined in red on a white background 120 Sirarpie Der Nersessian surmises that the textile represents a Chinese silk which may have been brought by one of John’s brothers who had visited the Mongol court or an

shops, transforming them into fertile ground for the creation of a range of syncretic expressions 128 It moreover shows that luxury items such as textiles served as primary transmitters of visual ideas, techniques, forms and fashions from the East Asian (primarily Chinese) visual culture to the West and played a prominent role in the formulation of new aesthetic idioms in Western Asia 129 It is noteworthy that together with the monumental dragons carved at the neighbouring site of Viār (fig 185) and the dragons that emerge in Armenian manuscripts (fig 193), the dragons depicted in the royal residence at Takht-i Sulaimān (figs 186a and b, 187a and b), in particular on the tile decoration, seem to be among the earliest instances of the appearance of Chinese-inspired Mongol dragons created in a Western Asian context It is most likely that the dragon motifs portrayed on Chinese or Central Asian textiles provided a model for the dragons rendered on other media 130 The dragon motif continued to be an important symbol in Ilkhanid manuscript illustration, of which one of the very greatest examples, the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh, was undertaken under Ghāzān Khān It was at his instigation that the great task of committing the Ilkhanids’ universal history to writing was assigned to the eminent grand vizier and patron of learning, Rashīd al-Dīn Faḍlallāh Hamadānī Ṭabīb (c. 645/1247), a convert from Judaism Intended to promote Mongol identity and transmit a written record of its distinctive history and achievements,131 the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh centres on Mongol history This ideological operation was made to fit into the literary mould of the subject population, aiming to place the Mongol Ilkhanids as rightful successors of the previous “legitimate” kings in Iran, thereby justifying ideologically the political process of amalgamating pre-conquest Iranian and Mongol Ilkhanid identity into one unified structure 132 Completed only after Ghāzān’s death during the

reign of Muḥammad Khudābandah Öljeitü in 706/1307–8, the compendium was probably transcribed and illustrated under the supervision of its author 133 By securing the preservation of his writings and their transmission, Rashīd al-Dīn ensured that both he and the pādishāh-i Īrān va Islām (as both Ghāzān and Öljeitü were called) would be remembered by posterity 134 Rashīd al-Dīn, who served the Ilkhanids Ghāzān and Öljeitü, had entered service in the Ilkhanid court as a physician (hence his appellation Ṭabīb, the physician) Not least through realising the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh, he became one of the key figures in the relationship between yuan China and the Iranian world during the Ilkhanid period His first volume, devoted to an official history of the Mongols and their conquests, is particularly informative since the vizier relied very largely on oral information, partly provided by Ghāzān Khān himself, and partly by the personal representative of the Great Khān, Bolād Zhengxiang (Pers Pūlād Chīngsāng, d 712/1313), who repeated to him passages from the now lost so-called Altin Defter (“Golden Book”), the official Mongol chronicle 135 According to Rashīd al-Dīn’s deed of endowment (waqfnāma) dated 709/1309, he created and sponsored a foundation, the Rab-ʿi Rashīdī (“Rashid’s quarter”), in an outlying quarter of Tabriz, which served as a centre of intellectual activity with numerous buildings including a mosque, madrasa, khānaqāh (dervish lodge), a hospital as well as a vast library and a scriptorium In the latter the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh and other texts authored by Rashīd al-Dīn (which were to be bilingual, that is to say copied in both Arabic and Persian, the two main literary languages of the Ilkhanid empire and the neighbouring states), were illustrated and illuminated, and then disseminated throughout the empire 136 The second volume of the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh deals with the histories of the “ancient kings,” the pre-Islamic rulers, then addresses Islamic history from the time of the Prophet Muḥammad to the
arrival of the Mongols Again this relied very largely on oral reports of native informants concerning the other peoples of the world with whom the Mongols came into contact 137 The dragon makes an appearance in the text as well as in the paintings In the section on the history of the Saljuqs an account is given of the Great Saljuq sulṭān Muḥammad ibn Malik Shāh, which details how at the beginning of his reign in 501/1108 he overthrew and killed the Mazyadid Sayf al-Dawla Ṣadaqa and the amīr Ayāz 138 Around the contenders a large army had gathered “in such a fashion that drawing up ranks for battle, their splendour and equipment outshone the Sultans ” In spite of this:
The Sultan had the aid of heaven and the assistance of the Lord They have written that, on that day of battle, black clouds, fire, thunder and lightning had appeared above the enemy, as well as the form of a dragon out of whose mouth fire was coming, so that the whole group threw away their weapons They recognized death, and beheld the fear and terror of the Resurrection 139
Rashīd al-Dīn’s description draws on visual signs of nature which include black clouds, fire, thunder and lightning He appears to allude to imagery used in the Qurʾān (sūra 2, 55–6):
And when you said, “O Moses, we shall not believe in you, until we see Allah manifestly,” the thunderbolt struck you, while you were looking on Then we made you alive after your death, so that you might give thanks
The natural phenomenon of the thunderbolt thus serves the purposes of heaven, miraculously hindering human vision At the same time Rashīd al-Dīn touches upon a Mongol belief according to which:
lightning storms come from an animal like a dragon, and in that region they witness it coming down out of the air onto the ground, striking its tail against the earth, coiling around itself, and pouring fire from its mouth 140

In literary sources such as the Shāh-nāma throne imagery is associated with the dragon The throne of Qaidāfa, queen of Andalusia, is described for example as having dragon-like feet 141 At the same time dragon iconography was often visually connected with scenes of enthronement Among the earliest surviving folios that were illustrated under the supervision of Rashīd al-Dīn are four that portray rulers seated on pedestal thrones with high columnar legs and raised footstools The edges of the segmented backrests of the thrones are decorated with horizontally projecting dragon-headed finials 142 In the compilation of histories of the “ancient kings,” the throne of Jamshīd/yima, the legendary Kayānid emperor of Iran, who encouraged the invention of weapons and the development of the crafts, is guarded by confronted dragon heads with curved, cervidtype antlers, long, floating manes and “beards,” their prominent snouts tapering to an upward curl 143 The representation of the dragon heads thus follow a Chinese-style koiné, one of the prime characteristics of which is its stag-like horns,144 a feature also present on the dragons depicted on the tiles of the royal residence at Takht-i Sulaimān The accession scene of sulṭān Lohrāsp in Balkh shows the back of the throne surmounted by dragon heads with closed snouts turned away from the ruler 145 Likewise, the finials of the throne of his son, the dragon-fighter Gushtāsp (who slew a wolf with the features of a dragon and went on to slay a dragon)146 terminate in dragon heads facing away from the ruler, which are closely comparable to those on his father’s throne but with two curved horns 147 It is notable that while
Jamshīd is flanked by confronted dragon heads that appear to be attentive and hence more likely to bestow their protective qualities upon him, Lohrāsp and Gushtāsp are, on the contrary, flanked by outward-facing dragon heads In Rashīd al-Dīn’s section on the history of India, the Kashmiri Buddhist Kamāla Shrī, who served in the Mongol court, seems to have been a source of information for the history of the later sultans of Delhi as well as of Kashmir and for Sanskrit sources of the life and the teachings of the Buddha 148 In the illustrations for this section the king of Kashmir, yashaskara (r 939–948), is seated on the dragon-throne His enthronement scene portrays nobles and Brahmans choosing the faqīr as new ruler, recognising that in spite of his poverty he has the power of persuasion (fig 194) The continued use of the motif of the enthroned ruler flanked by two upright elements topped by dragon heads shows that the convention to some extent persisted in the Mongol period, with the difference that stylistically the “Saljuq-style” dragons gave way to dragon representations with a Chinese-style veneer 149 The dragon-throne motif appears on another Ilkhanid-period miniature in the Topkapı Sarayı Library, Istanbul, attributed to c 700/1300, which illustrates a court scene 150 It portrays an unidentified nimbate ruler in the conventional pose of rulership, seated cross-legged on the cushioned throne raising his right hand to chest level and framed by courtiers The ruler is shown in frontal view and is larger than his attendants, whose densely drawn courtly pastimes emphasise the centrality of the sovereign’s throne The portrayal follows the iconographical canon of the frontally

rendered cross-legged ruler which became ingrained in the Near and Central Asian regions at the beginning of the Christian era The conventional depiction of the two winged flying geniis hovering over the sovereign while holding a shawl at either end was probably intended to bring heavenly fortune On the back of the imposing throne, oriented towards the ruler, are inwardcurving golden dragon-headed finials Crowned by a pair of bifurcated antlers, the long upturned snouts revealing sharp teeth and elongated tongue, a tangled mass of mane fluttering at the back and beard projecting from the chin, they are closely related to the dragon heads in the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh produced in 714/1314–5 The figures are rendered as ethnically East Asian, presumably Mongol, identifiable not only by their physiognomies with slant eyes, small mouths and round jaws but also their attire, while the scalloped upper edge of the ceremonial chair recalls Chinese-style models and is decorated all over with floral representations that also follow sinicised conventions, gold palmette-like blossoms set against a black background (fig 195) From the tip of the cusped apex of the throne back projects a tall, stemmed foliage bracketed at the stem from which issue stemmed blossoms held by smaller such brackets The vegetal composition is flanked by the dragon heads It is interesting to compare the representation to the similarly lavish descriptions known of Qubilai’s throne at Khānbāliq:
ornamented with dragons among clouds, and with a white awning and cushions embroidered in gold 151
Other emblems of power such as the dragon rod of Mūsā are also illustrated in the surviving folios of the Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh of Rashīd al-Dīn, transcribed and illuminated in Tabriz under the supervision of the vizier 152 In one of the miniatures Mūsā, Hārūn ibn ʿImrān (Aaron) and the Israelites stand watching the Egyptians drown in the Red Sea (Qurʾān, sūra 28, 76–82), while Mūsā is shown supporting himself on an elongated staff
that ends in a typically “Saljuq-style” dragon head with small pointed ears and prominent outwardcurling snout tip, the wide-open mouth revealing the teeth and the tongue In the same vein, the stirrup was associated with royalty in Mongol society Juwaynī whose family from Khurasan had been accustomed to serve in the Mongol administration, records in his Taʾrīkh-i jahān-gushāy that “the sign of a great emir [among the Mongols] was that his stirrups were of iron ”153 The use of dragon protomes on a thirteenth-century Mongol iron stirrup fragment, excavated in Qaraqorum, may therefore reflect the exalted status accorded to the stirrup in Mongol society The inward-facing heads, which Hans-Georg Hüttel identifies as lupine dragon heads,154 top the crossbar of the stirrup and are pictured with gaping jaws flanking the slot for the stirrup strap (fig 196) 155 The affiliation of the dragon symbolism with royalty156 took many forms In the Avestan texts the Iranian mythic hero-king Farīdūn brilliantly defeated the three-headed, six-eyed dragon Dahāka and fettered and imprisoned the beast on Mount Damāwand,157 achieving this feat not least on account of the magical powers attributed to him 158 Imbued with these powers, Farīdūn was even able to assume the shape of the beast he had vanquished, which he did to test the worthiness of his three sons, Salm, Tūr and Iraj; whereupon:
he roared, belched anger, sowed terror, and flames came out of his mouth When his three sons drew near, he saw the mountains had darkened around; he arose, with the clouds of dust about his feet, bearing rage and filled the world with roar and howl 159
After judging his sons’ reactions to these events, he divided his kingdom between them, Salm receiving the Near East, Tūr the Central Asian region beyond the Jayḥūn/Āmū Daryā (Tūrān), and Iraj the centre, Iran 160 The scene is portrayed in a miniature from the so-called small (that is, small-format) Shāh-nāma group of manuscripts,

datable to c 1300 Even though it portrays a scene from Iran’s epic past, the riders are depicted as ethnically Mongolian and/or Turkic, identifiable by their countenance and their apparel The depiction may once again illustrate the conscious effort of the Mongols to use ancient Iranian legends “to create a visual connection between past and present, equating, and thus legitimizing, Mongol rule and rulers with that of Iran’s legendary and historical dynasties ”161 The horsemen are shown with a giant horned dragon with a powerfully sinuous once looped body (fig 197) 162 In stylistic terms the representation of this dragon essentially continues Saljuq traditions The giant ophidian body is still rendered in looped form without legs and dorsal or pectoral fins yet the head of the mythical creature is now crowned by cervid-type antlers that project horizontally from the top of the head, a feature that emerged as part of the Chinese-style koiné of the dragon in the period after the Mongol invasion In spite of the introduction of this new aspect of the head, the giant serpentine knotted body dominates the image It is thus reasonable to assume that, in particular in the case of the representation of a scene from the Shāh-nāma, this stylistic modification did not have a bearing on the dragon’s iconological content Overall it may be noted that the imagery of the “Saljuq-style” dragon, at least the main characteristics such as the long gaping snout with upturned tip and long knotted ophidian body, exhibited a remarkable longevity, especially in the Anatolian region However, just as Salm, Tūr, and Iraj are depicted with Mongolian physiognomies and matching attire, so too the dragon, one of the key sinicising motifs introduced into Islamic art, slowly acquired certain Chinese or Chineseinspired Mongol aspects mirroring the process of a gradual penetration of East Asian art and
culture through the agency of the Mongols The syncretism reflected in the miniature referred to above may be regarded as another example giving visual form to the transitory period of a “melding of Mongol and Persian cultural identities and traditions ”163 Hence it appears that during the second half of their reign the Ilkhanids had integrated Chinese and Central Asian elements into a visual language of their own, gradually forging a syncretic Ilkhanid dynastic ideology which merged with local visual traditions Over the following decades the “Saljuq-style” dragon gradually gave way to a “Chinese-style” dragon which is also exemplified, for instance, in the depictions of the dragons portrayed in a manuscript of al-Qazwīnī’s ʿAjāʾib al-makhlūqāt preserved in the British Library, London (Ms Or 14140) Probably executed in the years between 694/1295 and 701/1302 – and perhaps in Mosul under the patronage of the governor Fakhr al-Dīn ʿĪsā (d 701/1302)164 – the London Qazwīnī distinguishes between an acquatic (al-tinnīn; fol 48r) and a terrestrial (the giant serpent, al-thaʿbān; fol 127r) dragon 165 The antlered head of the seadragon is closely related to the heads of the dragons of the Viār sculptures or the Takht-i Sulaimān tiles, whereas its body still follows intrinsically the “Saljuq-style ” Its marine quality is underlined by undulant serpents springing from from the nape of the neck in lieu of the customary tufts of hair The Chinese-style head is accentuated by the depiction of small floating Chinese-inspired clouds, sometimes read as fungus-shaped or magical fungus lingzhi 166 The so-called giant serpent is portrayed with a closely related head and, at first sight, appears to have a similar scaly serpentine body yet instead of the conventional knot, the fluidly rendered sinuous body, now accentuated with a crest along the spine, has acquired two muscular striding forelegs with two or three

The rising tide of East Asian forms that swept in [with the Mongol onslaught] did not represent a danger to Iranian artists but rather served as inspiration for new work in almost a creative sense With sovereign mastery they knew how to assimilate foreign elements without being untrue to themselves

unsheathed claws Another newly acquired feature is the band of flames that flickers along the dragon’s right leg and above its back, a characteristic already known from Central Asian textiles such as the above-mentioned fragment of a silk tapestry (kesi), dated between 1200 and 1300, featuring dragons chasing pearls 167 In spite of the fact that the dragon is shown with two rather than four legs, its depiction deserves particular attention because it is one of the earliest adoptions of a complete figure of a Chinese-derived dragon in Iranian painting 168 This debt to China is also evident in a miniature from the Great Ilkhanid Shāh-nāma of 13301335, portraying Bahrām Gūr, one of the most celebrated rulers of the Sasanian dynasty in the Shāh-nāma, killing a giant dragon, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art,169 or in a folio from the so-called “Small Shāh-nāma” group of manuscripts, dated 735/1335, featuring Isfandiyār’s third course, the dragon-slaying, preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 170 The new Chinese-derived elements were thus gradually assimilated into a well-established Western Asian dragon iconography As has been shown, the iconography of the Chinese-style dragon was meaningful for the Ilkhanids and their entourage but when transmitted to a Western Asian context it gradually disintegrated, to be appropriated only in fragmentary form by the receiving cultural milieu In the process of diffusion certain stylistic aspects of the Chineseinspired dragon motif were combined in hybrid fashion with prevailing Islamic artistic features and gradually integrated into existing traditions 171 The iconographic expression was thus
received through a Central Asian filter, resulting in a new creation which came to be de rigueur after the Ilkhanid period This assimilation through osmosis of the dragon imagery also provides eloquent testimony of the crucial role played by the pastoral nomads in the process of east-west exchange 172 Their creative energy and determined agency underlay the forging of a distinct aesthetic combining Western Asian and East Asian motifs in the post-Mongol period
b Syncretism and the dragon
The personal interest taken by the Muslim Ilkhans in Islamic mysticism extended to the teachings of wandering dervishes known for their antinomian and heterodox outlook These dervishes arose from a frontier milieu in Transoxania, Khurasan and Anatolia that was characterised by heroic figures, warrior adventurers and warrior saints that ensued from the age-old pastoral culture of predation but who in later Ottoman chronicles were portrayed as ghāzīs fighting for the defence and victory of Islam 173 It will be shown that in these liminal societies epic-chivalrous frontier narratives were characterised by the heroic valour associated with the dragon as well as the jihād against the dragon The dragon was used as a link to narrative intersections of otherwise unconnected heroic and saintly figures whose identities became connected and often amalgamated This was complemented by the cross-cultural convergence of saintly cults prominently involving the dragon in which Islamic, Turko-Mongol,

Jewish and Christian beliefs overlapped and merged At least from the period of Ghāzān Khān’s rule there was a growth in Shīʿite sects as well as a popularisation of ṣūfī orders together with an influx of Turkish converts 174 The Ilkhan took a personal interest in Islamic mysticism, an interest which was shared by his successors and subordinates While he was governor of Khurasan, even before his conversion, Ghāzān Khān visited the most important places of pilgrimage (turbat) of the region such as the graves of the celebrated mystics Abū yazīd (Bāyazīd) al-Biṣṭāmī (d 261/ 874 or 264/877–8), Abu ’l-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad Kharaqānī (d 425/1033) and Abū Saʿīd ibn Abi ’l-Khayr Mayhanī (d 440/1049) At that time he also went to see the shrine of the eighth Imam in Mashhad and the imposing mausoleum of sulṭān Sanjar near Marw Later as ruler he paid his respects to the great Shīʿa sanctuaries in Mesopotamia, Najaf and Karbalāʾ which he richly endowed by building irrigation channels as well as accommodation for pilgrims and sayyids 175 It is unfortunately not known which shaykh presided over Rashīd al-Dīn’s khānaqāh and whether he represented a mystic order (ṭarīqa) It is however known that numerous shaykhs visited the ṣūfī khānaqāh, for instance, the famed shaykh Ṣafī of Ardabīl (d 735/1334) Among the mystics that came to visit were also some wandering dervishes (qalandars), often characterised by their bizarre appearance and the fact that they “deliberately embraced a variety of unconventional and socially liminal practices ”176 One prominent representative was shaykh Barāq, a crypto-shamanic Türkmen dervish from Tokat in central Anatolia who scandalised onlookers by his strange appearance His chin was shaved but he had an oversize moustache and his upper incisor had intentionally been broken off 177 He would go almost naked but for a loincloth and a kind of felt turban to which bovine horns were attached
Around his neck he had a rope hung with hennadyed bovine teeth and bells, to the accompaniment of which he would dance in imitation of the movements of apes and bears 178 When the shaykh came first into the presence of Ghāzān Khān in Tabrīz, a tiger (or, according to some accounts, a lion) was unleashed on him to test his supernatural powers, but Barāq like many mystics could communicate with animals and a shout from him was enough to subdue the wild beast 179 Thereafter he enjoyed close links with the Ilkhanid court and is said to have exercised some influence over Ghāzān and Öljeitü In 707/1307–8, on his way to see Öljeitü, Barāq went on an expedition to Gīlān Near Lāhījān he and some of his followers were intercepted by a group of people, upbraided for being “friends of the Tatars” and killed Those of his followers who survived the attack took the shaykh’s bones back for burial at Sulṭāniyya where a hospice was built for his followers by the Ilkhanid ruler 180 The likes of Barāq Bābā arose from a frontier milieu in Transoxania, Khurasan181 and Anatolia 182 The boundary regions in which such elements subsisted constituted a refuge for political or religious dissidents as well as wandering bands of soldiers of fortune that provided the core population of this war-like frontier society where many divergent cultural elements came into contact with each other The groups in which the Turkish ethnic element predominated also served as a source for mercenary recruits Maḥmūd of Ghazna (r 389/999–421/1030) for instance is known to have drawn heavily upon this resource of ghāzīs for his Indian campaigns 183 The Central Asian frontier of Islam became a zone of conversion by the tenth century For the most part the ghāzīs adopted an Iranian version of Islam and maintained some of their own preIslamic traditions Dervish preachers, often characterised by their heterodox outlook, were instrumental in the process,184 among them Barāq,

who is said to have been a disciple of the dervish Ṣarī Ṣaltūq Dede, the thirteenth-century semilegendary Turkish warrior saint,185 and to have received from him both supernatural powers and his name (Barāq: Qıpchaq Turkish “hairless dog”) The mixed, composite cultural and ethnic elements of frontier life were a melting-pot of contradictions that in spite of its ambiguous dimensions brought about the awareness of a special identity This was at times characterised by the common ideology of jihād, in its guise as holy war186 inspired by esoteric mystic beliefs with a military following as well as guilds dominated by akhīs,187 a kind of fraternal congregation comparable to the classical Islamic futuwwa institution,188 and sects of heterodox dervishes 189 The ghāzīs were inspired to fight the infidels and expand the frontiers of Islam but at the same time were driven by the economic motivation of having to obtain their livelihood from plunder These regions thus witnessed a whole spectrum of countercultural occurrences, “interstitial events” or liminal phenomena, thus offering an appropriate abode for the liminal symbol par excellence, the dragon A chivalric-heroic code developed in these frontier societies, propagated principally through prose epic tales in which the dragon played a key role 190 One of the main characteristics of these epicchivalrous frontier narratives is the jihād against the dragon In Abū Ṭāhir of Ṭūs’s popular epic Abū Muslim-nāma (“Book of Abū Muslim”),191 the legendary Abū Muslim Khurāsānī (d c 137/754–5), champion of the jihād, fights against the heretics who transformed themselves into dragons 192 At the same time, the dragon is considered a heroic ideal and the ghāzīs are called upon to be as valiant as dragons in the fight,193 a notion that can also be found in the epic Wīs u Rāmīn, in which the warriors are similarly urged to be as heroic as a dragon (azhdahā-kirdār) 194 Muslim epic heroes such as the Iranian Abū
Muslim or the Arabic Baṭṭāl Ghāzī, the latter immortalised in the Turkish romance Baṭṭālnāma (“Book of Baṭṭāl”),195 possess pronounced supernatural skills They represent a dervish-shaman type celebrated for their religious leadership among the wandering dervishes, and conduct jihād against fire-spitting underground dragons, sometimes polycephalic, in order to liberate young men and women 196 The tales of Abū Muslim and Baṭṭāl Ghāzī provided the models for other epic works on Malik Dānishmend (Pers “wise, learned man”) and Ṣarī Ṣaltūq Dede that celebrate the exploits of the conquerors of Anatolia 197 In the campaign of conquest in Asia Minor, or Anadolu as it was later called by the Turks, which continued for more than three centuries, advancing Saljuq troops were harried by raids on the part of irregular, unruly and often tribal nomad elements, generally referred to as Türkmen (Turkoman) The belligerent activities inherent in their modus vivendi led to ravaged lands that characterised a major frontier zone called uj (extremity, border or border fighter), often interchangeably used with the Turkish term aqīnjī (raider) alongside that of ghāzī 198 The everincreasing numbers of these nomads on the Armenian and Byzantine frontiers in eastern Anatolia swelled the ranks of the Arab, Kurdish and Dailamī ghāzīs who had long fought their Byzantine counterparts, the akritai The location of this frontier warfare stretched from Tarsus along the Taurus mountains through Cilicia up to Malatya (Melitene) and the mountains of Armenia in eastern Anatolia The disputed land was known as ḍawāʾiḥ al-Rūm (the exterior lands facing the “Roman”/Byzantine lands), in other words, it was situated at the periphery of one cultural complex and adjacent to another As the invasions into Asia Minor progressed, a gradual displacement of old boundaries towards the west took place In Anatolia the Muslim ghāzīs were

fighting against the infidel Christian akritai, who were however themselves often recruited from among Turkish mercenaries 199 Thus the borderlands were to a certain extent also a zone of interaction with overlapping socio-cultural spheres As a result of the Mongol invasions the impact of the ghāzīs in eastern Asia Minor was again augmented through renewed waves of Central Asian Turkish tribes which also contained large numbers of wandering dervishes, fleeing from the invaded Central Asian and western Iranian provinces This frontier life on both sides of the border was profoundly different from that of the more stable and peaceable hinterlands The epic prose literature that developed on both sides of the centuries-old frontier zone, both Byzantine and Arabo-Turkish, gives an insight into this phenomenon Epics include the Turkish romance of Sayyid Baṭṭāl and the Byzantine Greek chivalric epic of Digenis Akritas of the eastern frontier Owing much to the Arabic folk prose epic Sirāt al-amīra Dhāt al-Himma (also known as Dhu ’l-himma or Delhemma),200 the latter relates the fabulous exploits of the early Muslim frontier warrior al-Baṭṭāl and his companion, ʿAbd al-Wahhāb, during the early wars against Byzantium in the Umayyad period The acts of heroism carried out on the Byzantine frontier by the ArabChristian warrior Digenis include the feat of vanquishing a dragon 201 Heroic deeds of this type provided the key element for such Turkish Anatolian wondrous epics as the Baṭṭāl-nāma Resembling the Byzantine hero, who is mentioned in the Baṭṭāl-nāma, the pseudo-historical al-Baṭṭāl becomes a prototype of popular Turkish literature as ancestor of the Türkmen ghāzī state of the Dānishmendids
(463/1071–573/1178) in the wake of the conquest of Asia Minor The story of the exploits of Sayyid Baṭṭāl Ghāzī, whose oral roots may be sought as early as the arrival of the Dānishmendids in Anatolia,202 became incorporated into the religiousheroic epic cycle of the important frontier city of Malatya,203 and is set within the historical context of the Arab-Byzantine frontier battles before they gradually turned into Turko-Byzantine wars 204 In the tale Baṭṭāl, who carries the sword of the hominoid dragon Ẓaḥḥāk,205 and other heroic figures, friends as well as foes, are referred to as dragons 206 The inherent ambiguity of the mythical creature is graphically depicted in several scenes Baṭṭāl enters an underworld populated by fire-spitting dragons which he holds at bay by drawing a magic circle 207 However the emeraldheaded serpent king, who possesses knowledge of the healing properties of plants, comes to greet the warrior, who eight days later is pulled up to the surface of the earth by holding on to the tail of a giant dragon 208 The dragon also appears as a defender of the faith in dreams threatening to swallow those who do not convert to Islam,209 while at the same time its open mouth is evoked to symbolise a grave calamity 210 Close parallels are found in the Türkmen epic romance Dānishmend-nāma (“Book of Dānishmend”), also based on orally transmitted traditions and composed in the twelfth or early thirteenth century The hero, Malik Aḥmad Dānishmend Ghāzī,211 founder of the eponymous Dānishmendids who in the early twelfth century were as powerful as the Saljuqs, appears as a ghāzī in Anatolia fighting the Christian warriors of the First Crusade in Cappadocia 212 In the romance he is identified with Sayyid Baṭṭāl 213 Both the ghāzīs214 and Malik Dānishmend,215 whose heroic

The Greeks found themselves caught between these two dragons
The impact of the dragon symbolism on these frontier societies is furthermore documented by the fact, mentioned earlier, that after the Dānishmendid conquest of Malatya, the last Dānishmenid ruler of Malatya, Nāṣir al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Ismāʿīl minted a copper coin in the 1170s featuring a dragon-slaying equestrian warrior 216 Similar feats are described in the mid-fifteenthcentury hagiography, the epic Ṣaltūq-nāma (“Book of Ṣaltūq”), of the eponymous warrior saint, a religious leader among the circles of wandering dervishes The narrative describes how Ṣarī Ṣaltūq was transported to the summit of Mount Qāf, doing battle there with a dragon that threatened the nest of a sīmurgh, a mythical bird from Iranian mythology 217 At another time Ṣaltūq battles jāżūs (sorcerers, wizards)218 who ride on lions and dogs brandishing serpents in their hands 219 Ṣarī Ṣaltūq is also known to have propagated Islam in the Crimea and the Dobruja 220 He had joined the fleeing Rūm Saljuq sulṭān ʿIzz al-Dīn Kay Kāwūs II to whom the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus had allocated Dobruja, south of the Danube delta in Rūmeli, as a base to settle with his men 221 The legendary frontier saint saved the kingdom and at the fortress of Kaliakra
(Qilghra) killed a seven-headed dragon which had captured the daughters of a king 222 Afterwards, the people converted to Islam and Ṣaltūq built a tekke (dervish lodge) 223 According to the Ṣaltūq-nāma, Ṣarī Ṣaltūq is said to have had close relations with Ḥājjī Bektāsh (possibly d 669/1270–1), the patron of the heterodox Bektāshiyya order of dervishes in Anatolia 224 Ḥājjī Bektāsh’s spiritual affiliations are linked to the great mystic Aḥmad yasawī (d 562/1166–7) from western Turkestan and, according to legend, he is regarded as a khalīfa or representative of shaykh yasawī,225 the eponym of the yasawiyya that had a wide following among Turkic nomads in Central Asia Allegedly the mystic sent him to Anatolia to propagate his order there 226 However, before coming to Rūm (Anatolia) Ḥājjī Bektāsh accomplishes several heroic feats According to the principal hagiographical work concerning the saint, the Wilāyat-nāma, written in Turkish prose between 886/1481 and 907/1501,227 Ḥājjī Bektāsh conjures up natural disasters such as flood, drought, famine and an eclipse and as yet another manifestation of a dervish dragon-slayer he overcomes a dragon, thereby converting the people of Badakhshān (the mountainous region situated on the left bank of the upper reaches of the Āmū Daryā) to Islam 228 It is likely that Ḥājjī Bektāsh was part of the westward migration caused by the Mongol invasion of Khurasan 229 According to legend the dervishes from Rūm tried to prevent him from coming to their lands from greater Khurasan Ḥājjī Bektāsh overcomes this struggle by a wellknown miracle, namely by going to Anatolia transformed as a dove 230 Later, after changing

into a human being again, he was met by a mystic, Sayyid Maḥmūd Hayranī from Akshehir accompanied by three hundred Mawlawī (Turk Mevlevī) dervishes who rode lions and used serpents as whips 231 As seen earlier, the imagery of mystics exerting power through handling snakes was prominent in the medieval Islamic world The mystic thus demonstrated his ability to control, manipulate and effectively master the very deadliest of creatures that are also invested with great powers As noted above, the feat of riding on animals and wielding snakes as whips is also ascribed to the jāżūs (sorcerers) who frequently appear in Abū Ṭāhir of Ṭūs’s popular epic tales 232 When seeing the opposing mystic on a lion and holding a serpent, Hājjī Bektāsh is said to have mounted a rock (or according to later traditions a wall) and ordered it to move Forthwith it changed itself into a bird and set off Hājjī Bektāsh thereby demonstrated superiority over an adversary who could only exercise control over animate beings whereas he was able to rule the inanimate as well In this context the semi-legendary saint and patron of the Anatolian tanners’ guilds, Akhī Evrān (Evran or Evren, “snake, dragon”), should also be mentioned Not only did he free the inhabitants of Kırşehir in central Anatolia from a dragon but he was able to metamorphose into a serpent and appeared in the form of this animal in his tomb (türbe) 233 These tales demonstrate not only the pivotal importance of the potent symbolism of the dragon or its kin, the serpent, but its use as a link to narrative intersections of otherwise unconnected heroic and saintly figures whose identities became connected and often amalgamated In this process of blending, the function of malleable stories was complemented by the role of cult sites where Islamic, Turko-Mongol and Christian beliefs overlapped and amalgamated The origins of the Bektāshiyya date from the aftermath of the thirteenth-century heterodox
Bābāʾī insurrections during the reign of the Rūm Saljuq sulṭān Ghiyāth al-Dīn Kay Khusraw II Ḥājjī Bektāsh was to some degree associated with these uprisings, not least because he became a leading disciple of a certain Bābā Rasūl-Allāh, also known as Bābā Ilyās Khurāsānī, the Bābāʾī leader who was executed at Amasya in 639/1240, the year of the revolt 234 Bābā Ilyās, the great-grandfather of the fourteenth-century ṣūfī master Elvān Çelebi, was also seen as a manifestation of the immortal Islamic Prophet Khiḍr Ilyās/Hızır-Ilyās 235 Elvān Çelebi’s hagiographic work al-Manāqib al-qudsiyye (760/1358–9) written in Turkish prose, which records the legend of Bābā Ilyās and the Türkmen revolt, is one of many deeds of saints and founding figures written at least a generation after the subject’s death, hence often linking a recent past with a historical present 236 The dervish lodge of Elvān Çelebi in the village of Tekkeköy near Çorum provides an example of a multilayered composite foundation which reflects the cross-cultural encounters between Muslim and Christian societies and documents a religio-cultural symbiosis The site has been identified with the pilgrimage site Euchaita to which the remains of the Byzantine dragon-slaying warrior saint Theodore Tyron were brought According to Elvān Çelebi, Bābā Ilyās was a companion of Khiḍr (Hıżır yoldašı) 237 In the mid-sixteenth century, German travellers visited Elvān Çelebi’s zāwiya and noted that the dervishes were dedicated to the cult of Khiḍr Ilyās One of the visitors, Hans Dernschwamm, notes in his travel journal:
the Turks esteem nor know of no other saint but Saint George whom they call Khiḍr Ilyās, ... that he has not died and still lives
He also recounts that the dervishes pointed out traces of Khiḍr’s visit to the site Among these were the remains of a dragon he had slain, a hoof

spiritual hierarchy of Islam He is the eternal omnipresent Prophet, “the Verdant One,” who appears to believers to help and advise them in need and console them in grief 242 Khiḍr is invested with an eschatological significance in both primordial and apocalyptic times, appearing sometimes as the light of Muḥammad (nūr Muḥammadī; the Prophet’s pre-existing entity) but more generally as his helper, as well as that of the entire Muslim community 243 He is closely associated with the element of water and is still revered today in Mesopotamia as patron saint of water 244 The place of pilgrimage gained in importance when the figure of the martyr Mār Behnām was conflated with Saint George, and then in turn equated with the conspicuous Islamic mythical Saint Khiḍr 245 Significantly, it is because of the syncretism of Mār Behnām (Saint George) and Khiḍr that in 694/1295 the Ilkhan Baidu, grandson of Hülegü/ Hūlāgū (r Jumādā I to Dhu ’l-qaʿda 694/MarchOctober 1295), is said to have spared the monastery of Mār Behnām from destruction while other monasteries were ravaged 246 The Ilkhan’s presence at the monastery is documented by an inscription in Old Turkish (Uighur) in the crypt, invoking the blessing of Khiḍr Ilyās on behalf of the Khān and his entourage 247 In the inscription Khiḍr is addressed as “Khiḍr Ilyās ” The Islamic

the inscription is notable because it represents the most western testimony of ancient Uighur during the Ilkhanid period I am grateful to Professor Dr Zieme for the reading of the Uighur inscription which adds the word m(a)r to the reading of Harrak, A and Niu Ruji, op. cit. 248 Franke, 2000, pp 159–61 It is interesting to note that Elijah’s gentilic is hat-Tišbî (I Kings 17 1) which is thought to be located somewhere in Gilead Since miraculous powers of provoking drought and granting rain were ascribed to the Prophet, he must have been assimilated to some extent with the storm god Teshub of the Hurranians who lived together with the Semites in northern Syria Elijah was moreover known as the greatest healer in Hebrew legend, his miracles including even the resurrection of the dead (I Kings 17:1724) See Astour, 1965, pp 215, 297 249 This fusion also pertains to the whole complex of myths and legends associated with both Khiḍr and Ilyās Massignon, 1956, pp 269–90 Cf van Lint, 2005, pp 365–8 250 Cf Hasluck, 1929, vol 2, p 498; Roux, “Hızır,”WdM VII, 1, pp 327–8; Franke, 2000, pp 167–73; Pancaroğlu, 2004, pp 151, 157–8 At the Turkish Hızırellez festival the meeting of Khiḍr and Ilyās coincides with the return of spring and the regeneration of nature See Franke, 2000, p 148
251 Preusser, 1911, pl 10, top; Fiey, 1965, pl F (drawing of Mār Behnām slaying the devil represented as a horned prostrate figure with long tail) 252 The dating of this relief is disputed and ranges from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century (Fiey, 1965, pp 605–7) The cult of Mār Behnām in his quality of Khiḍr was until recently the object of a divination cult whereby mainly female pilgrims would throw a handkerchief or other light cloth at the large plaster relief; if it stuck to the croup of the horse, it was taken as a sign that their prayers were answered It is not too long ago that the “magic nails” were removed Cuinet, vol 2, 1890–5, repr 2001, p 832 253 Mélikoff, 1960, vol 1, pp 162, 260–2, vol 2, pp 75–7; Franke, 2000, pp 133–4 254 Van Lint, 2005, pp 349–57 255 Russell, 1987, pp 202–4, 217; van Lint, 2005, pp 364–5 For instances of the identification of Khiḍr with the Armenian Saint Sergios (Sarkis) in eastern Anatolia, see Hasluck, 1929, vol 2, pp 570–1; Fowden, 1999, p 190 256 Cf Redgate, 2000, pp 123, 125 257 Pancaroğlu, 2004, p 158 258 Eadem, pp 158, 161
Prophet al-Khiḍr/al-Khaḍir and the biblical Prophet Ilyās (Elias/Elijah)248 also known in the Qurʾān (sūra 37, 123–32) are thus associated as a pair and sometimes identified with one another 249 This gives rise to a multi-layered composite character adopted also in popular Turkish tradition as Hızır-Ilyās (often contracted to “Hızırellez/Hıdrellez”) 250 At the monastery of Mār Behnām the iconographic programme of the dragon-slayer is represented as two confronted dragon-slaying horsemen who spear, respectively, a prostrate dragon with a heart-shaped knot at its mid-section, and an anthropomorphic figure, representing Satan, beneath their horses; the rider slaying Satan is identified as Saint Behnām (fig 198) 251 The relief, which flanks a very weathered centrally projecting lion head, is shown on the lintel above the so-called “royal door” that leads to the burial chamber of Saint Behnām In this position it not only helped to demarcate the sacred threshold, but as an auspicious and apotropaic motif served to protect the tomb The funerary association of the imagery perhaps once again echoes popular eschatological notions similar to those expressed in the Cappadocian wall paintings above the vestibule door of the previously mentioned yılanlı kilise in the Ihlara valley (fig 106) To the left of the royal door is a depiction of Saint Behnām alias Saint George on horseback, here in the role of dragon-slayer, represented on a large plaster relief 252 The depictions reflect a multifaceted notion which was deeply rooted in popular spirituality The connection of Khiḍr with the dragon-slay
ing motif appears also in the Dānishmend-nāma, in which Malik Dānishmend battles with a firespewing dragon responsible for swallowing hundreds of ghāzīs at a monastery called Deryānōs After several futile attempts Malik Dānishmend finally overcomes the mythical creature which was created by the magical skills of the monks in the monastery He accomplishes this feat through guidance received in a dream from the legendary early Arab warrior ʿAbd al-Wahhāb, who instructs him to countermand the beast’s magical powers by reciting Khiḍr’s prayer and then blowing in the direction of the dragon 253 yet another convergence of role can be seen between Khiḍr and John the Baptist (the Armenian Surb Karapet, the Holy Precursor)254 who assumed the qualities of the long-haired (gisavor) Zoroastrian dragon-fighting hero Vahagn 255 The apostle thus became the christianised version of the important Zoroastrian figure, some of whose qualities were passed on to the “Forerunner of Christ ”256 In this way Surb Karapet, like Khiḍr, also became associated with dragon-fighting The attribution of such miracles as dragonslaying to figures of legendary or saintly status, sometimes through the agency of the pivotal Khiḍr Ilyās, may be seen as part of a process of cultural adaptation in which the idea of a relative contextual and conceptual continuity becomes a cross-cultural point of contact 257 The iconography of the dragon-fighter thus proved ideally suited to transcend a variety of religious and secular contexts while epitomising, in the words of Pancaroğlu, “the fundamental themes of rescue, relief, triumph, and resurrection ”258
