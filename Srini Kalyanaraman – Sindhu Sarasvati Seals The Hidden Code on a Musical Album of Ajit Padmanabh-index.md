Songs from Voider Perspectives, latest album from World Void Web
Song#3 is called "Sindhu-Sarasvati Seals - The Hidden Code". It is about the SindhuSarasvati Civilization (popular as Indus Valley Civilization) and the hidden metallurgical codes behind the seals.
It features legendary researcher and historian Srini Kalyanaraman and his spoken words about the greatness of the civilization and the path-breaking linguistic studies he has undertaken for the last 2 decades of his life.
My pranams to his tireless work and for allowing me into his world when I met him in Chennai a couple of years ago. Thank you Srini Kalyanaraman sir.
