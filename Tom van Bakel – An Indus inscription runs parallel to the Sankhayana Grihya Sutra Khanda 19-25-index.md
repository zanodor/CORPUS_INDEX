# Index for Tom van Bakel – An Indus inscription runs parallel to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25.pdf

An Indus inscription runs parallel to the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25
A cylinder seal made in the Indus Valley Civilization is extremely interesting because its signs run parallel with both seven chapters from the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra (Ritual rules for birth) as well as with a number of nakshatras and constellations.
H-369 a
Here is the imprint of this remarkable seal, it is clear that it only depicts signs, there is no image on it at all. In this essay I will try to show how these signs relate to the text of the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25. In addition, they are also related to a number of nakshatras such as Krittika, Pushya and Sravana.
H-369 E H-369 C
These are the signs that are applied on the top and bottom of the seal, they match the ones that are depicted on the side.
Number 4718 10/20
It is clear that the photo of the imprint is rather vague, but fortunately I. Mahadevan has converted the inscription into these drawn signs, and he has published them in 'The Indus Script Texts, Concordance and Tables'. This conversion is sufficient and that is why I use it for my analysis.
As an introduction to this inscription I first tell you something about some individual signs.



H-2144 A
I'll start with this single arrow depicted on the front of a damaged stamp. It is mentioned in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra and it suggests a male embryo entering a womb, because Khanda 19 reads: ‘May a male embryo enter thy womb as an arrow the quiver’:
Khanda 19
6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months.
H-2144 B
In the same sentence we read: ‘May a man be born here, a son after ten months’:
Khanda 19 6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months.
On the other side of the broken stamp this ‘son, born after ten months’ is depicted as a simple human figure.
So, a single arrow indicates that an embryo enters a womb and the human figure portrays the son who is born about ten months later.
On the following pages you will see that this simple message is depicted on many stamps by means of arrows indicating conceiving and vulva signs indicating delivery.

Here is a small drawing of a vulva: it has been depicted in all times and in all cultures and variations of this vulva are also carved on Indus Valley stamps, usually indicating that a mother gives birth to a child.
H-456 M-757
On the left are again arrows suggesting a male embryo enter a womb, as an arrow the quiver. On the right are vulva images suggesting that sons are delivered about nine months later. The next four stamps depict a variant of this ‘rhomb-shaped vulva’.
H-388 BMN : 1947,0416.2
M-868 M-1226 A



M-236
This stamp shows a vulva image with a trident depicted within it. This ancient weapon is a symbol of the nakshatra Sravana:
23; 20 Sravana (hearing or ear) Range: 10°00' — 23°20' Capricorn Symbol: ear, trident, row of three uneven footsteps Deity: Vishnu, Saraswati Mode of Functioning: Passive Cast: Mleccha Gender: Male Body parts: ears, genitals Humor (Ayur Vedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: south, northwest Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): air Gana (Type): Godly Orientation: Upward Disposition: Moveable Ruling Planet: Moon Sounds: Ju, Je, Jo, Gha Animal symbol: monkey Primary Motivation: Artha
Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
As you can see in this list, Saraswati, the goddess of speech and music, is a deity of this nakshatra. She also appears in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra because when the son is born his father performs ‘The Ceremony for the Newborn Child’. During this Ceremony he recites a text asking the goddess to rejoice in his son, for the sake of joy:
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). (-) 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, selfproduced.'
And thus, the arrow in the above inscription tells us that a male embryo enters a womb, as an arrow the quiver: this conceiving takes place in Krittika. The vulva image with a trident inside tells us that a son is born about nine months later in Sravana. As Saraswati is a deity of this nakshatra she is the one who is present during the birth of this son.



M-1066
This piece of an Indus stamp shows a vulva image divided into six. It represents the vulva of Shashthi (whose name literally means: ‘Sixth’), a moon goddess.
‘The worship of Shashthi is prescribed to occur on the sixth day of each lunar month of the Hindu calendar as well as on the sixth day after a child's birth. Barren women desiring to conceive and mothers seeking to ensure the protection of their children will worship Shashthi and request her blessings and aid. She is especially venerated in eastern India. She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
She is often pictured as a motherly figure, nursing one or more infants.
M-1906 M-86
On this page we see four arrows on the left and four six-divided vulva images on the right. Again, the arrows suggest that male embryos enter wombs, as arrows the quiver. The vulva images suggest the delivering of sons about nine months later in the presence of Shashthi.
M-117 M-303



H95-2485e
An inverted Omega is cut out on this stamp. In this sign there is a goddess carrying a branch on her head. This must be a special branch because on the following stamps it is located in the vulva images, indicating that these vulvas belong to the above goddess.
M-753 A1 H-1027 a
On this page we see three inscriptions carved on three stamps. They all start with an arrow suggesting three male embryos entering three wombs, like arrows the quiver. The vulva images with branches in them suggest that the ‘branch goddess’ is present when three sons are born about nine months later.
M-959



http;//en.finaly.org/index.php/The earliest precursor of writing
Finally, the womb can also be symbolized by a diamond.
M-175
In the Indus Valley this womb/diamond is depicted in this way.
M-1696 a M-781
Here are two Indus Valley stamps with arrows on the left and diamonds on the right. Once again, the two arrows suggest male embryos entering two wombs, as arrows the quiver, and the diamond shaped vulvas suggest the birth of these embryos about nine months later.
When we study the Indus stamps, we can surmise that these stamps were among the highpoints of the Indus Valley Civilization. And, as you see, many of these seals declare that the owner of that seal receives a son: that his child was conceived and born. From this we may conclude that in the Indus Valley Civilization, receiving a son was one of the most important events in a person's life.



Number 4718 10/20
Now we focus on the seven lines depicted on the drawing of Mahadevan: as we will see they may have had the meaning of ‘breathing’, ‘speech’ or ‘praying’.
M-20a
If we want to understand these lines, we can best look at a stamp like this one. Six lines are scratched out in the middle of it. The attractiveness of this stamp is that the lines are clearly situated between a diamond and three triangles, so we can easily find out what their meaning is in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra, because the diamond suggests that a mother gave birth to a child and the three triangles represent the three constellations in which this child was born:
Khanda 23
1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child).
2. Let (the father) breathe three times on the new-born child and then draw in his breath with the words,
o 'Draw in your breath with the Rik, o breathe within with the Yagus, o breathe forth with the Sâman.'
9. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in his right ear, 'Speech!' 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.'
Khanda 25 5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities.
Now we can see that in between the birth of the son and the sacrifice to the three constellations, the father breathes three times over his just born son and draw in his breath while uttering three sentences. He also pronounces the word ‘Speech’ three times and recite over his son a text. These may have been the six actions that are symbolized by the two times three lines. The lines thus indicate ‘breathing’ and ‘reciting a (ritual) text’.



H-660
Arrow Another male Three lines suggesting three sproken texts
Now we can study the three lines that appear on many seals between the arrow and the vessel. On this tablet, a human figure has been added to these two signs, giving us the opportunity to better determine what the three lines really stand for.
Again, the arrow suggests that a male embryo enters a womb, as an arrow the quiver:
Next to it is a human figure holding a knife. This figure suggests another male, who may be born after the first male child, as we read in the following sentence:
'Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth.
Then there are three lines, the first one may indicate the text the man utters about his sperm:
'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhâtar (possessing; bearing), thus Pragâpati has said.
The second line may indicate the text the man utters about the creating god Pragâpati and the shaping god Savitar:
'Pragâpati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man.
And the third line may indicate the text the man utters to his wife:
'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow. 'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, put into her; to generation we call thee. 'Open thy womb; take in the man's sperm; may a male child be begotten in the womb. Him thou shalt bear; (having dwelt) ten months in the womb may he be born, the most excellent of his kin.'
Thus the three lines may indicate that the man utters three texts: one about his sperm, one about the creating and shaping deities, and one to his wife.



M-753 A1
Third month
This stamp clearly depicts a ladle situated inside a vessel, in Khanda 20 it is called ‘the Guhû ladle’:
Khanda 20 1. In the third month the Pumsavana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a male child), 2. Under (the Nakshatra) Pushya or Sravana. 3. Having pounded a Soma stalk, or a Kusa needle, or the last shoot of a Nyagrodha trunk, or the part of a sacrificial post which is exposed to the fire, 4. Or (having taken) after the completion of a sacrifice the remnants from the Guhû ladle,
As you can read in the text, in this Khanda ‘Pushya’ is mentioned. This nakshatra is situated in Cancer and its name can be translated as ‘The Nourisher’. So, when the sun passes through this nakshatra the man makes a drug of a Soma stalk, or a Kusa needle, or the last shoot of a Nyagrodha trunk, or the part of a sacrificial post which is exposed to the fire. Then he sprinkles this drug into the right nostril of the mother, probably in order to ‘nourish’ the foetus. He may have done this with the Guhû ladle, and this ladle is clearly depicted on the above stamp.
Thus, when in heaven the sun passes through 'The Nouriser', the man on earth can try to 'nourish' the fetus with a Guhû ladle.



H-369a
We return to the imprint of the very interesting seal. Now we will see how these signs are described in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 and how they are related to a number of nakshatras, such as Krittika, Pushya and Sravana.
H-369 E
This Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 starts describing a man pounding the root of the Adhyandâ plant. This man in fact makes a Soma drug, and this drug is symbolized on the top of the cylinder seal by as so-called ‘Soma drop’:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-68 The drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One, And, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering robe wherewith the udders stream.
These ‘Soma drops’ are painted on many vessels from the Indus Valley Civilization.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickelopteris
The man used the root of an Adhyandâ plant whose leaf looks like the tip of an arrow. This makes sense as the embryo to be said to go inside the womb like an arrow a quiver.



Number 4718 10/20
First month
We jump over to the signs applied to the side of the cylinder seal. As said before, the arrow on the left symbolizes a male embryo entering the womb, like an arrow the quiver.
Then there are three lines. Now we know that the first line indicates the text he says about his sperm:
'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhâtar (possessing; bearing), thus Pragâpati has said.
The second line indicates the text he says about the creating god Pragâpati and the shaping god Savitar:
'Pragâpati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man.
And the third line indicates the text he says to his wife:
'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow. 'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, put into her; to generation we call thee. 'Open thy womb; take in the man's sperm; may a male child be begotten in the womb. Him thou shalt bear; (having dwelt) ten months in the womb may he be born, the most excellent of his kin.'
A short note: the conceiving of the embryo takes place in Taurus and that is why is said to this embryo: 'be a well-breeding cow':
Another short note: in this Khanda the deities 'Agni', 'Pragâpati' and 'Savitar' are mentioned. They are linked with the nakshatras 'Krittika' and 'Rohini', two nakshatras situated in Taurus, because, according to the next list Agni is the Rigvedic name of Krittika. In addition, Savitar is a sun god and Surya (Son) is the Astrological Mate of this nakshatra:
3 Krittika an old name of the Pleiades; personified as the nurses of Kārttikeya, a son of Shiva. Pleiades Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun) Symbol: Knife or spear Rigvedic name: Agni, god of fire Indian zodiac: 26°40′ Mesha – 10° Vrishabha Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Taurus – 6° Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
The creator god 'Pragâpati' is also mentioned and according to the next list his name is the Rigvedic name of Rohini:
4 Rohini ‘the red one’, a name of Aldebaran. Also known as brāhmī Aldebaran Astrological Mate: Chandra (Moon) Symbol: Cart or chariot, temple, banyan tree Rigvedic name: Prajapati, the Creator Indian zodiac: 10° – 23°20′ Vrishabha Western zodiac: 6° – 19°20′ Gemini
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
And thus we may say that Khanda 19 is highly linked to Taurus, Krittika and Rohini.



Number 4718 10/20
Third month
The third sign is vessel with a ladle, called ‘the Guhû ladle’ in Khanda 20 and it may have been used in the third month.
As said before: in Khanda 20 ‘Pushya’ is mentioned. This is a nakshatra situated in Cancer and its name can be translated as ‘The Nourisher’. So, when the sun passes through ‘Pushya’ the man makes a drug. Then he sprinkles this drug into the right nostril of the mother, probably in order to ‘nourish’ the fetus. He may have done this with the Guhû ladle, which is clearly depicted on the above stamp.
Thus, when in heaven the sun passes through 'The Nourisher', the man on earth can try to 'nourish' the fetus with a Guhû ladle.
There is another relationship between Khanda 20 and Pushya, because according to the following list, Bṛhaspati is the Rigvedic name of this nakshatra:
8 Pushya/Tishya ‘the nourisher’, also known as sidhya or tiṣya γ, δ and θ Cancri Astrological Mate: Shani (Saturn) Symbol: Cow's udder, lotus, arrow and circle Rigvedic name: Bṛhaspati, priest of the gods Indian zodiac: 3° 20′ – 16° 40′ Karka Western zodiac: 29° 20′ Cancer – 12° 40′ Leo
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
He is the priest of the gods. In parallel, Khanda 20 speaks of a priest performing various acts:
'May he succeed who lights fire' (V, 37, 2),
2 With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser, sing with stones adjusted: And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with his oblation to the river.
So, when in heaven the sun passes through the nakshatra Brhaspati, priestly acts are performed on earth.



Number 4718 10/20
Fourth month
The fourth sign is a vertical line that can indicate that the man is reciting a text in the fourth month. In Khanda 21 we read that a ceremony is then held to protect the child. During this ceremony, the man recites a Rigveda hymn asking Agni to drive away malady:
Khanda 21. 1. In the fourth month the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the embryo), 2. Sacrificing six oblations from a mess of cooked food with (the six verses of the hymn), 'Agni, joined with the prayer' (Rig-veda X, 162),
Rigveda 10-162 Agni 1. May Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Raksas-slayer, drive away The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb. 2 Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of the flesh, The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb. 3 That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo, That which will kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive far away. 4 That which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married pair, That penetrates and licks thy side, -even this will we exterminate. 5 What rests by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of lord, And would destroy thy Progeny, -even this will we exterminate. 6 That which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and lies down by thee, And will destroy thy progeny, --even this will we exterminate.
In this fourth month the sun passes through Leo and in this constellation there are three nakshatras and one of them is Magha:
10 Maghā ‘the bountiful’Regulus Astrological Mate: Ketu (South lunar node) Symbol: Royal Throne Rigvedic name: Pitrs, 'The Fathers', family ancestors Indian zodiac: 0° – 13° 20′ Simha Western zodiac: 26° Leo – 9° 20′ Virgo
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
According to this list, the Rigvedic name of this nakshatra is 'Pitrs', i.e., 'The Fathers'. The point is that in Khunda 25 we can read Agni gives life three times:
'(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis;
So, the fire-god is a ‘life-giving’ god and, as I said before, he is the deity of Krittika. Because he is the deity of this nakshatra he the one who gives life to this embryo during the conceiving. This implies that he is the divine father of this embryo. And thus, when the sun passes through Maghā, with the Rigvedic name ‘The Fathers’ the human father recite the Rigved hymn 10-162 in which he asks Agni, the divine father, to drive away malady.



Number 4718 10/20
Fourth month
In Khanda 21 we also read that the man smears his wife with Âgya salve:
3. With (the verses), 'From thy eyes, thy nose' (Rig-veda X, 163), verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
According to Rigveda 10-163, the husband wants to expel malady from all body parts of his wife:
Rigveda 10-163
1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin, Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine, From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart, From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet, From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails, From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
It is obvious that the woman is lying on a bed and the funny thing is that the nakshatras Pūrva Phalgunī and Uttara Phalgunī are symbolized by legs of a bed:
11 Pūrva Phalgunī ‘first reddish one’ δ and θ Leonis Astrological Mate: Shukra (Venus)
Symbol: Front legs of bed, hammock, fig tree
Rigvedic name: Aryaman, god of patronage and favours Indian zodiac: 13° 20′ – 26°40′ Simha Western zodiac: 9° 20′ – 22°40′ Virgo
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
12 Uttara Phalgunī ‘second reddish one’ Denebola Astrological Mate: Surya (Sun)
Symbol: Four legs of bed, hammock
Rigvedic name: Bhaga, god of marital bliss and prosperity Indian zodiac: 26° 40′ Simha- 10° Kanya Western zodiac: 22° 40′ Virgo – 6° Libra
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
So in the fourth month the sun passes through the legs of a bed situated in the sky and parallel to this, the woman here on earth may lie on a bed while husband smears her with an salve from bottom to top to drive away malady. So, when the sun passes through a bed in heaven it is favorable to lie on a bed on earth.



Number 4718 10/20
Seventh month
The sign inside the red frame symbolizes a vessel filled with food, because in the seventh month the man cooks a mess of food as we can read in Khanda 22:
Khanda 22 1. In the seventh month, at her first pregnancy, the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the hair). 2. He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire. 3. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the Mahâvyâhritis. 4. He cooks a mess of food,
5. According to some (teachers) boiled rice with Mudga beans. 6. The implements used and the Nakshatra should be of male gender. 7. (He then sacrifices with the following texts,) 'May Dhâtar give to his worshipper further life and safety; may we obtain the favour of the god whose laws are truthful.
This mess of food turns out to be a drug and in the Indus Valley Civilization each drug is called Soma.
In the seventh month, the sun passes through Scorpio and one of the nakshatras of this constellation is Mula. This nakshatra is symbolized by a 'Bunch of roots tied together'.
Mula ‘the root’ ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ and ν Scorpionis Astrological Mate: Ketu (South lunar node)
Symbol: Bunch of roots tied together, elephant goad
Rigvedic name: Nirrti, peak of material achievement and the beginning of the spiritual impulse Indian zodiac: 0° – 13° 20′ Dhanus Western zodiac: 26° Sagittarius – 9° 20′ Capricorn
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
It seems obvious to me that this 'bunch of roots' will be the ingredients of a heavenly dish, which means that the moment a dish is made in heaven, the man cooks a mess of food on earth.



Number 4718 10/20
Ninth month
The sixth sign is a trident, ands according to the next list this weapon is one of the symbols of the nakshatra Sravana:
23; 20 Sravana (hearing or ear) Range: 10°00' — 23°20' Capricorn Symbol: ear, trident, row of three uneven footsteps Deity: Vishnu, Saraswati Mode of Functioning: Passive Cast: Mleccha Gender: Male Body parts: ears, genitals Humor (Ayur Vedic Constitution): Kapha Direction: south, northwest Guna (Essence): Rajas Tattwa (Element): air Gana (Type): Godly Orientation: Upward Disposition: Moveable Ruling Planet: Moon Sounds: Ju, Je, Jo, Gha Animal symbol: monkey Primary Motivation: Artha
Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
Khanda 23 reads that the man smears his wife with a salve made from various plants:
Khanda 23
1. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the egg-plant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas.
So, with this salve the Rakshas are driven away: this driving away may be symbolized by the trident.
So, when in the seventh month the sun passes through Sravana, symbolized by a trident, the man smears his wife with a salve to drive away the Rakshas.



Number 4718 10/20
Tenth month
The last sign of the top line is another vessel and Khanda 24 describes the ceremony for the new-born child. During this ceremony the man uses a golden vessel or a golden spoon:
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). (-) 3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon),
It is clear that in the inscription this golden vessel is represented by the vessel on the right. It is linked to Aquarius, because in India, the name of this constellation is 'Kumbha', which means 'Water-Pitcher'.
Aquarius is an equatorial constellation of the zodiac. The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha ‘water-pitcher’.
Aquarius (constellation) - Wikipedia
It means that a son conceived in Krittika is born in 'Kumbha' about ten months later. Right after birth the father feeds his son using a golden bowl or a golden spoon.
So, in winter, when the sun passes through Kumbha, the celestial pitcher, the father feeds his newly born son from a golden vessel.
H-369 C
Tenth month
We now turn to the signs engraved on the bottom of the seal: on the left there is a vessel, suggesting that after ten days the father cooks a mess of food in Aquarius/Kumbha:
Khanda 25 1. After ten days the getting up (of the mother from childbed). (-) 4. Let (the father) cook a mess of food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement, 5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities. 6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra). 7. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,)
So, when the sun passes through Kumbha in heaven the father cooks a mess of food on earth.



H-369 C
Tenth month
Finally, the three lines suggest that the father performs three offerings, reciting three verses at the same time:
KHANDA 25. 1. After ten days the getting up (of the mother from childbed).
The first line depicted on the stamp indicates that the man utters a verse for Agni, the god of fire:
7. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis; may thy face and thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow, protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.'
The second line indicates that the man utters a sentences for the Soma drug:
Rigveda 1-91 Soma. 7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, And energy that he may live.
And the third line indicates that the man finally the man pronounced aloud the name and caused the Brâhmanas to say auspicious words:
Having pronounced aloud (the child's) name, and caused the Brâhmanas to say auspicious words,



M-753 A1
Again, on this imprint we see a vessel in third place, with a ladle in it. It refers to the Guhû ladle mentioned in Kandha 20:
Khanda 20 4. Or (having taken) after the completion of a sacrifice the remnants from the Guhû ladle,
H-53
Kumbha
Nevertheless, on this imprint, a vessel containing a spoon is situated at the right. This spoon suggests that a son is born Aquarius/Kumdha, because in Khanda 24 ‘the ceremony for the new-born child’ is described. And during this ceremony the father mix together a number of ingredients, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon):
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). 3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon),
And thus, this ‘golden vessel or with a golden spoon’ is depicted on the right indicating the birth of the son.

So, a child conceived in Krittika can be born in Aquarius about nine months later. In India, the name of Aquarius is 'Kumbha'. This means that in winter, when the sun passes through this celestial pitcher, the newly born child may be fed from a golden vessel (or a golden spoon).

Just to tell the whole story: the three lines in the middle may symbolize that the man utters texts in the first month, in the fourth month and in the tenth month.

Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Chapter 19-25
Khanda 19.
1. Let him pound the root of the Adhyândâ plant (Prisniparnî ('speckled-leaf,' Hemionitis cordifolia) Hemionitis cordifolia); and sprinkle it at the time of her monthly period with the two (verses), 'Speed away from here; a husband has she' (Rig-veda X, 85, 21. 22),
21 Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. I laud Visvavasu (Some of the most prominent gandharvas include Tumburu, Visvavasu (who was the father of Pramadvara), with hymns and homage. Seek in her father's home another fair one, and find the portion from of old assigned thee. 22 Rise up from hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee. Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride.
with svâhâ at the end of each, into her right nostril.
2. 'The mouth of the Gandharva Visvâvasu art thou'—with these words let him touch her, when he is about to cohabit with her. 3. When he has finished, let him murmur, 4. 'Into thy breath I put the sperm, N.N.!' 5. Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!' 6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months. 'Give birth to a male child; may after him (another) male be born; their mother shalt thou be, of the born, and (to others) mayst thou give birth. 'In the male verily, in the man dwells the sperm; he shall pour it forth into the woman: thus has said Dhâtar (possessing; bearing), thus Pragâpati has said. 'Pragâpati has created him, Savitar has shaped him. Imparting birth of females to other (women) may he put here a man. 'From the auspicious sperms which the men produce for us, produce thou a son; be a well-breeding cow. 'Roar, be strong, put into her an embryo, achieve it; a male, thou male, [a bull, o bull] put into her; to generation we call thee. 'Open thy womb; take in the man's sperm; may a male child be begotten in the womb. Him thou shalt bear; (having dwelt) ten months in the womb may he be born, the most excellent of his kin.'
Footnotes 45:6 19, 6. The first verse is that quoted already at chap. 16, 8. The text of the verses quoted in this Sûtra is very corrupt; see the notes on p. 36 of the German edition.
Khanda 20. 1. In the third month the Pumsavana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a male child), 2. Under (the Nakshatra) Pushya (Bṛhaspati, priest of the gods) or Sravana. 3. Having pounded a Soma stalk, or a Kusa needle, or the last shoot of a Nyagrodha trunk, or the part of a sacrificial post which is exposed to the fire, 4. Or (having taken) after the completion of a sacrifice the remnants from the Guhû ladle,



5. Let him sprinkle it into her right nostril with the four verses, 'By Agni may good' (Rig-veda I, 1, 3),
3 Through Agni man obtaineth wealth, yea, plenty waxing day by day, Most rich in heroes, glorious.
'That sperm to us' (III, 4, 9),
9 Well pleased with us do thou O God, O Tvastar, give ready issue to our procreant vigour, Whence springs the hero, powerful, skilled in action, lover of Gods, adjuster of the press-stones.
'May he succeed who lights fire' (V, 37, 2),
2 With kindled fire and strewn grass let him worship, and, Soma-presser, sing with stones adjusted: And let the priest whose press-stones ring forth loudly, go down with his oblation to the river.
'Of tawny shape' (II, 3, 9), with Svâhâ at the end (of each verse).
9 Born is the pious hero swift of hearing, like gold in hue, well formed, and full of vigour. May Tvastar lengthen our line and kindred, and may they reach the place which Gods inhabit.
Footnotes 46:3 20, 3. On suṅgâ compare the note of Nârâyana and the verse quoted from the Karmapradîpa, p. 131 of the German edition. On kusakantaka Nârâyana says, kusakantakam kuso darbhas tasya kantakah sûkî (sûka, MS. Berol. Orient. fol. 60z) tam vâ peshayitvâ. I do not understand why the commentators of Pâraskara, whom Professor Stenzler has followed in his translation of Par. I, 14, 4, make kantaka equal to mûla. 46:5 Nasto dakshinatah stands here as in chap. 19, 1. Âsvalâyana I, 13, 6 has dakshinasyâm nâsikâyâm, and so has also p. 47 Pâraskara I, 13. Comp. the natthukamma treated of in the Pâli Buddhist texts (Mahâvagga VI, 13) and in the medical literature.
Khanda 21. 1. In the fourth month (Leo) the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the embryo), 2. Sacrificing six oblations from a mess of cooked food with (the six verses of the hymn), 'Agni, joined with the prayer' (Rig-veda X, 162),
Rigveda 10-162 Agni 1. May Agni, yielding to our prayer, the Raksas-slayer, drive away The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb. 2 Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of the flesh, The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb. 3 That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving embryo, That which will kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive far away. 4 That which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married pair, That penetrates and licks thy side, -even this will we exterminate. 5 What rests by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of lord, And would destroy thy Progeny, -even this will we exterminate. 6 That which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and lies down by thee, And will destroy thy progeny, --even this will we exterminate.
3. With (the verses), 'From thy eyes, thy nose' (Rig-veda X, 163), verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
Rigveda 10-163 1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin, Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,



From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart, From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet, From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails, From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
Khanda 22. 1. In the seventh month (Purva Ashadha: Varuna), at her first pregnancy, the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the hair). 2. He causes her, after she has bathed and put on a (new) garment which has not yet been washed, to sit down behind the fire. 3. He sacrifices, while she takes hold of him, with the Mahâvyâhritis. 4. He cooks a mess of food, 5. According to some (teachers) boiled rice with Mudga beans. 6. The implements used and the Nakshatra should be of male gender. 7. (He then sacrifices with the following texts,) 'May Dhâtar give to his worshipper further life and safety; may we obtain the favour of the god whose laws are truthful. 'Dhâtar disposes of offspring and wealth; Dhâtar has created this whole world; Dhâtar will give a son to the sacrificer: to him you shall sacrifice, an offering rich in ghee.' (Besides) with the three verses, 'Negamesha, fly away' (Rig-veda Khailika sûkta, after X, 184, vol. vi, p. 31),
Rigveda 10-184 1. May Vishnu form and mould the womb, may Tvastar duly shape the forms, Prajapati infuse the stream, and Dhatar lay the germ for thee. 2 O Sinivali, set the germ, set thou the germ, Sarasvati: May the Twain Gods bestow the germ, the Asvins crowned with lotuses. 3 That which the Asvins Twain rub forth with the attrition-sticks of gold, That germ of thine we invocate, that in the tenth month thou mayst bear.
and in the sixth place the verse, 'Pragâpati' (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).
Rigveda 10-121 Ka. 10 Prajapati! thou only comprehendest all these created things, and none beside thee. Grant us our hearts' desire when we invoke thee: may we have store of riches in possession.
8. (The husband then) parts her hair, upwards, beginning from the middle, with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots, or with a Darbha needle together with unripe Udumbara fruits, with the words, 'Bhûr bhuvah svah.' [‘Erde, Luftgebied, Himmel]. 9. He lays down (the thing he has used) in her lap, 10. Ties (the fruits) to a string of three twisted threads and fastens them to her neck with the words, 'Rich in sap is this tree; like the sappy one be thou fruitful.' 11. (The husband) then says to lute-players, 'Sing ye the king12. 'Or if anybody else is still more valiant.' 13. Having poured fried grain into a water-pot, let him cause her to drink it with the six verses,



'May Vishnu take care of thy womb,' 'I call Râkâ' (Rig-veda X, 184, 1; II, 32, 4-8).
Rigveda 10-184 1. May Vishnu form and mould the womb, may Tvastar duly shape the forms, Prajapati infuse the stream, and Dhatar lay the germ for thee.
14. Let him then touch her (with the words), 15. 'The winged one art thou [A falcon are you, a bird], the Garutmat; the Trivrit (stoma) is thy head, the Gâyatra thy eye, the metres thy limbs, the Yagus thy name, the Sâman thy body.' 16. Let him cause her to sing merrily, 17. Wearing, if she likes, many gold ornaments. 18. A bull is the fee for the sacrifice.
Footnotes 48:8 22, 8. Comp. above, chap. 12, 6. 48:10 Nârâyana: tisribhis tantubhir vritte sûtre udumbaraphalâni . . . gale . . . badhnâti. I have translated accordingly. Pâraskara I, 15, 6 uses the same expression trivrit. Professor Stenzler there translates it, on the authority of Gayarâma, 'dreifache Haarflechte,' and says in his note on that passage that, according to Sâṅkhâyana, he would have to tie the things with a threefold string to the neck of the woman, as if Sâṅkhâyana's statement were different from that of Pâraskara. But both authors have the same word, and only the commentators differ in their explanations thereof. 48:11 Âsvalâyana more explicitly says (I, 14, 6), Somam râgânam samgâyetâm iti. 48:13 In my German translation there is a mistake which should be corrected. I have there referred shalrika to the verses Râkâm p. 79 aham, which are actually only five in number. The six verses are Vishnur yonim, &c., and the five verses mentioned. 49:15 Vâgasaneyi Samhitâ XII, 4. 49:16-17 16, 17. Nârâyana: modamânîm harshayuktâm tam mâṅgalikair gîtair gâyayet . . . mahâhemavatîm bahvâbharanayuktâm vâ gâyayet.
Khanda 23.
1. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the eggplant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas.
Khanda 24. 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). 2. Let (the father) breathe three times on the new-born child and then draw in his breath with the words, 'Draw in your breath with the Rik, breathe within with the Yagus, breathe forth with the Sâman.' 3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon), 4. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the wisdom (‘veda’) raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!'(with these words) he gives him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, consisting of two syllables, or of four syllables, or also of six syllables; he should take a krit (suffix), not a taddhita. 5. That (name only) his father and his mother should know. 6. On the tenth day a name for common use, which is pleasing to the Brâhmanas. 7. Let him pulverise black and white and red hairs of a black ox, intermix (that powder) with those four substances (see Sûtra 3), and give it to eat (to the child) four times: such (is the opinion of) Mândûkeya (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad).



8. If he likes (let him do so) with the words, 'Bhûh! The Rig-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Bhuvah! The Yagur-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Svah! The Sâma-veda I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ! 'Bhûr bhuvah svah! Vâkovâkya (colloquies), Itihâsa, and Purâna—Om! All the Vedas I lay into thee, N.N., svâhâ!' 9. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in his right ear, 'Speech!' 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.' 11. Let him tie a piece of gold to a hempen string, 12. And bind it to (the child's) right hand until (the mother) gets up (from childbed). 13. After the tenth day let him give it to the Brâhmanas, 14. Or keep it himself.
Footnotes 49:1 24, 1. Comp. Dr. Speijer's essay on the Gâtakarman (Leiden, 1872). Nârâyana observes that, as it is prescribed below (chap. 25, 4) that a mess of food is to be cooked in the sûtikâgni, here the sûtikâgni is established, and sacrifice is performed therein. The Sûtra I, 25, 4, from which it is to be inferred that the sûtikâgni should be kept, is considered, accordingly, as a Gñâpaka (see Professor Bühler's notes on Âpastamba I, II, 7; Gautama p. 50 I, 31; Nârâyana's note on chap. 25, 4, p. 133 of the German edition). 50:2 Abhyavânya should be corrected into abhyapânya, as in IV, 18, 1 nearly all the MSS. read nivâta instead of nipâta. The Sâmbavya MS. reads in the text, trir abhyânyânuprânya; in the commentary trir anyapânyânuprânyâ. Comp., on the terminology of the different vital airs, Speijer, Gâtakarma, p. 64 seq.; Eggeling, S.B.E., vol. xii, p. 20. 51:8 Veti vikalpârthe. bhûr rigvedam ityâdikaturbhir mantrair asâv ity atra pûrveva (read pûrvavat?) kumâranâmagrahanapûrvakam kumâram prâsayet. Nârâyana. 51:12 Bâlasya dakshine haste. Nârâyana.
Khanda 25. 1 1. After ten days the getting up (of the mother from childbed). 2. Father and mother with washed heads, wearing (new) clothes which have not yet been washed; 3. And so also the child. 4 4. Let (the father) cook a mess of food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement, 5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities. 6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra). 7 7. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis; may thy face and thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow, protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.' The tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse, 'Thou, Soma, givest bliss to the old one' (Rig-veda I, 91, 7).
Rigveda 1-91 Soma. 7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, And energy that he may live.



8. Having pronounced aloud (the child's) name, 9. And caused the Brâhmanas to say auspicious words, 10. And having sacrificed in the same way every month to the Tithi of (the child's) birth, 11. He sacrifices, when one year has expired, on the (ordinary) domestic fire.
Footnotes 51:1 25, 1. After ten days the impurity (asauka) that falls on the mother at her confinement, ceases; see Gautama XIV, 16; Manu V, 62; Vasishtha IV, 21. 52:4 Comp. the note on chap. 24, 1. 52:7 The first Mantra is corrupt; in the Âsvalâyana-Srauta-sûtra (II, 10, 4) its text runs thus, âyush te visvato dadhad ayam agnir varenyah, &c. Comp. Atharva-veda VII, 53, 6. 52:11 'The words ‘every month’ (Sûtra 10) retain their value p. 53(here also). Thus the sûtikâgni is to be kept through one year. After the lapse of that year one should sacrifice every month on the domestic fire as long as his life lasts. As it is said ‘in the domestic fire,’ the sûtikâgni is not to be kept any longer.' Nârâyana.
