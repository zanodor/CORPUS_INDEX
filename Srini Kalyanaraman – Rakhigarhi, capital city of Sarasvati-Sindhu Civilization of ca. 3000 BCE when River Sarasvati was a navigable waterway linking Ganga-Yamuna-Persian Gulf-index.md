Two plate tectonic events resulted in the migration of tributary rivers into Sarasvati River system. Yamuna -- tributary of Sarasvati River -- migrated eastwards to join Ganga. Sutlej -tributary of Sarasvati River -- migrated westwards to join Sindhu. Both the plate tectonic events resulted in tears in the Siwalik ranges which resulted in the migrations of Yamuna and Sutlej rivers respectively in sequence. The dates of the events have to be precisely determined. Presence of ancient settlements on the river banks of the palaeo-channels of these tributaries help determint the ancient navigable waterways prior to ca. 2000 BCE on River Sarasvati which together with Panchnad and Sindhu constituted the Sapta Sindhu region of Rgveda.
