Contributions made by metalwork artificers to the wealth of India. Evidence of data archives on 3rd millennium BCE professional calling cards of Indus Script
Three types of professional calling cards with inscriptions of metalwork artificers of Tin-Bronze Age have been identified in the Indus Script Corpora of over 8000 inscriptions.
The evidence is presented in the following four sections of the monograph:
1. Cyliner seal of Shu-ilishu as professional calling card
2. Bronze anthropomorphs as professional calling cards
3. Stoneware bangles as professional calling cards
4. Compare with stoneware bangles are torcs as professional calling cards on 1. Kernunnos of Gundestrup cauldron and 2. Kernunnos on Pilier des nautes (Note:Comparable to the 'stoneware bangles' as calling cards are the torcs shown on 1. Kernunnos of Gundestrup cauldron and 2. Pilier des nautes which names Kernunnos in an inscription on the 1st cent. CE Pillar of the Boatmen (French Pilier des nautes) with bas-relief depictions. These evidences are presented in Section 4.)
Kernunno or Cernunnos is cognate with kārṇī m. ʻ prime minister, supercargo of a ship ʼ (supercargo is a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its
sale.), kul -- karṇī m. ʻ village accountant ʼ (Marathi) kāraṇika m. ʻ teacher ʼ MBh., ʻ judge ʼ Pañcat. [kā- raṇa -- ]Pa. usu -- kāraṇika -- m. ʻ arrow -- maker ʼ; Pk. kāraṇiya -- m. ʻ teacher of Nyāya ʼ; S. kāriṇī m. ʻ guardian, heir ʼ; N. kārani ʻ abettor in crime ʼ(CDIAL 3058) karṇadhāra m. ʻ helmsman ʼ Suśr. [kárṇa -- , dhāra -- 1]Pa. kaṇṇadhāra -- m. ʻ helmsman ʼ; Pk. kaṇṇahāra -m. ʻ helmsman, sailor ʼ; H. kanahār m. ʻ helmsman, fisherman ʼ.(CDIAL 2836).
Section 1. Cylinder seal of Shu-ilishu as professional calling card

The rollout of Shu-ilishu's Cylinder seal. Courtesy of the Department des Antiquites Orientales, Musee du Louvre, Paris. The cuneiform text reads: Shu-Ilishu EME.BAL.ME.LUH.HA.KI (interpreter of Meluhha language).
The Shu-ilishu cylinder seal is a clear evidence of the Meluhhan merchants trading in copper and tin. The Meluhha merchant carries melh,mr̤eka 'goat or antelope' rebus: milakkhu 'copper and the lady accompanying the Meluhhan carries a ranku 'liquid measure' rebus: ranku 'tin'
Apparently, the Meluhhan is the person carrying the antelope on his arms. I also suggest that on the Shu-ilishu cylinder seal, a significant hieroglyph is shown. It is a crucible which may have been used by the copper-tin artisans to work with an extraordinary invention called ukku in Kannada produced in a crucible. I suggest that Kannada word ukku is the root word because of semantic association signified by cognate words: uggi, urika which mean 'burning'. Crucible steel process is vividly explained by these etyma. "Another Akkadian text records that Lu-sunzida “a man of Meluhha” paid to the servant Urur, son of AmarluKU 10 shekels of silver as a payment for a tooth broken in a clash. The name Lu-sunzida literally means “Man of the
just buffalo cow,” a name that, although rendered in Sumerian, according to the authors does not make sense in the Mesopotamian cultural sphere, and must be a translation of an Indian name." (MASSIMO VIDALE Ravenna

Section 2. Bronze anthropomorphs as professional calling cards
Anthropomorphs are ‘professional calling cards’, dharma samjña, signifiers of responsibilities of the metalsmith-carpenter-merchant
Anthropomorphs of Sarasvati Civilization are Indus Script hypertexts which signify metalwork.
Anthropomorphs of

In metawork processes, there are two distinct operations: 1. ingots which are brought out of a smelter furnace and 2. ingots like wedges forged in a smithy to achieve the desired shapes of implements.

This is an anthropomorph found at Saipa. It uses orthographic forms drawn from Indus Script hieroglyphs signifying horns of a ram, an a person in seated posture. In other variants, the copper artefact shows two spread legs of a human. Anthropomorphic figure. Northenr India, Doab region, GangaSarasvati Basins. Copper hoard culture. Copper. H. 35.7 cm.W 2.8 cm. Inv. 2504-137. “Like most of the other exemplars of this type, this anthropomorphic figure in copper was probably found in a ‘hoard’, composed of a set of objects deliberatey buried in the ground, a way to store objects of value or to make religious offerings. Paul Yule has enumerated 129 of these ‘caches’, which, in addition to anthropomorphic figures,may contain harpoons, spears, flat axes, and swords (Paul Yule, 1989/1992). One of these figures was found at the site of Saipa, but no stratigraphic information or context has allowed u to provide a precise date, which may have been

situated during the second millennium BCE. The figure itself displays no cutting edge or particular traces of its function, apart from the longitudinal impact marks from hammering, suggestive of those on an ingot, and short obliqu groovs superposed on thee fist st of marks, indicating a second operation, perhaps linked to the act of making an offering – Published in Yule, 1998.

I suggest that the anthropomorphs evidenced from the days of Sarasvati Civilization (e.g., find of Lothal) are Indus Script hypertexts to signify the professional calling card of a blacksmith, metalworker, artisan.
I suggest that the anthropomorphs of the types found in Sheorajpur and Haryana with Indus Script hieroglyphs are dharma samjña, signifiers of responsibilities or functions performed by the holder of the hieroglyphicsculptural token. The hieroglyphs indicate the functions of metalworker and trader of metal merchandise.
The findspot of Type II anthropomorph (with 'fish' hieroglyph) is Sheorajpur where an ancient Shiva temple has been discovered. The temple ceiling is decorated with metalwork plates of sculptural friezes attesting to the metalwork tradition of the site during the Bronze Age (See image of a temple in Sheorajpur with metal ceiling).

Sheorajpur anthropomorph with 'fish' hieroglyph and 'markhor' horns hieroglyph. ayo'fish' Rebus: ayo 'iron, metal' (Gujarati) khambhaṛā 'fish fin' rebus: kammaṭa 'mint, coiner, coinage'.
The anthropomorph which stands with spread legs. karṇaka 'spread legs' (Atharvaveda XX.133) rebus: karṇī 'supercargo, a representative of the ship's owner on board a merchant ship, responsible for overseeing the cargo and its sale.) The shape of all three types is patterned like the horns of a ram: miṇḍāl ‘markhor’ (Tōrwālī) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ ‘iron’ (Mu.Ho.) Meluhha glosses are annexed which indicate association with cire perdue (or lost wax) method of casting metals using beeswax, particularly in the glosses for miedź, med' 'copper' in Northern Slavic and Altaic languages.
Type 2 anthropomorph shows: ram's horns,standing person with spread legs, modified with hieroglyph 'fish'. ayo 'fish' rebus: ayas 'alloy metal'
Ram's horns and standing person with spread legs are modified with
additional hieroglyphs on Type 3 anthropomorphs: कोंद kōnda ‘engraver,

On these anthropomorphs
reported from Haryana (by Ahuja) and from ASI Central Antiquity Section (by Sanjay Manjul) , two hieroglyphs are added to the basic Type 1 anthropomorph of 'ram' and 'standing person': boar ligatured to the head; one-horned young bull inscribed on the chest. (The composite copper Anthropomorphic figure along with a copper sword was found by Dr. Sanjay Manjul, Director, Institute of Archaeology at the Central Antiquity Section, ASI, Purana Qila in 2005.)
A brilliant exposition on the etymology of the word Varāha is provided
by वाचस् पत् यम ् Vācaspatyam: वराय अभीष्ठाय मुस् तादिलाभाय आहन्तत खनतत भूममम ् To
represent a boon, (to obtain) wished, desired products (including species of grass) mined from the earth, by striking, hitting. Thus, Varāha is a hieroglyph metaphor to represent, signify mining for minerals.Both anthropomorphs (Sheorajpur and Haryana) are shaped like a standing person with spread legs and with the horns of a markhor or ram.
On the second type of anthropomorph, a Varāha head is ligatured to the top of the anthropomorph and an additional hieroglyph is incised on the chest: That of a 'one-horned young bull' which accounts for nearly 80% of pictorial motifs on Indus Script seals. miṇḍāl markhor
(Tor.wali) meḍho a ram, a sheep (G.)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: meḍh ‘helper of merchant’ (Gujarati) mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' (Mu.Ho.) med 'copper' (Slavic) meṛed-bica = iron stone ore, in contrast to bali-bica, iron sand ore

(Santali) Varāha is explained by वाचस् पत् यम ् Vācaspatyam: वराय अभीष्ठाय
मुस् तादिलाभाय आहन्तत खनतत भूममम ् To represent a boon, (to obtain) wished,
desired products (including species of grass) mined from the earth, by
striking, hitting. Hieroglyph: Spread legs: कर्णक m. du. the two legs
spread out AV. xx , 133 'spread legs'; (semantic determinant) Rebus: karNa 'helmsman', karNI 'scribe, account' 'supercargo'. Thus, the hieroglyphs on the anthropomorph Type 2 signify a helmsman, engraver who works with metals and mines to produce supercargo of mined products.

How were ceramic (stoneware) bangles made? Stoneware bangles are
unique because they carry micro-inscriptions. “The term ‘stoneware’ was used by the early excavators to designate artifacts with a highly siliceous, partially sintered, homogeneous ceramic body, usually free from inclusions or voids visible to the naked eye, and characterized by a very low
porosisity.”(J.M. Blackman, M. Vidale, 1992, The Production and Distribution of Stoneware Bangles at Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa as Monitored by Chemical Charachterization Studies, in: Catherine Jarrige, ed., 1992, South Asian Archaeology 1989, Prehistory Press,

View of the slag with the coated sub-cylindrical bowl enclosing the stoneware bangles in a pile, in central position, Mohenjodaro. (Massimo Vidale, in: Jansen and Urban, 1987, p. 109)
Kenoyer has shown that these bangles were formed by throwing clay cylinders on a fast wheel and trimming and burnishing them with sharp pointed tools which left distinctive, fine parallel marks on them. Smalll saggars or firing containers were used to stack these bangles for firing. *sa

Reconstruction of the stoneware bangles' firing apparatus; stoneware bracelets are piled up in five pairs and enclosed in a coated carinated jar. The jar is given red-slipped, chaff-tempered outer coating. The apparatus is mounted on a network of supporting terracotta bangles. A unicorn seal impression is affixed on the upper capping. (Massimo Vidale, in:Jansen and Urban, 1987, p. 111) I suggest that this sealing documents the use of a pot as a

The artisan preparing ceramic (stoneware) bangles with inscriptions is clearly the standard-bearer for the Indus Writing system which was stunningly uniform across time and space over an extensive contact area on the Vedic Sarasvati river basin and extended along the maritime tin route



14
from Hanoi to Haifa. If such an organizational structure is posited, it is possible to explain the uniformity maintained in the writing system on over 2600 sites of the civilization and also in contact areas where Meluhha merchants had established colonies. As an extended hypothesis, it is suggested that the recipient of the ceramic (stoneware) bangles in the work areas (sites) of the civilization are authorised to be scribed for documenting and archiving the metalwork catalogues.
The ceramic (stoneware) bangles are of great significance because of the special care taken by the artisans to prepare the artifacts incised before firing. Massimo Vidale and others have done pioneering archaeo-research to reconstruct the processes involved in preparing these written artifacts, almos as data archiving of ancient times during the Bronze Age. The descriptions of the processes provided by Massimo Vidale are gratefully acknowledged. Distinction between terracotta bangles and ceramic (stoneware) bangles)

Harappa. Kot Diji phase streets were filled with debris, including potsherds, charcoal, ash, animal bones, and occasional bangles and steatite beads. A distinction has to be made between terracotta bangles and these inscribed ceramic (stoneware) bangles. Most terracotta bangles are uninscribed and are of sizes which are wearable by men and women. The ceramic (stoneware) bangles are of a very small size and NOT meant to be worn but perhaps used as centre-pieces of the fillet band of the type worn by Mohenjo-daro priest king on his forehead and right shoulder, as insignia, as professional titles or functions

Red stoneware bangle (H2000-4490/9843-01) with no inscription. The lack of inscription may indicate that this may have been a place where the bangles were stored prior to inscribing them for distribution.
Many of the terra cotta bangles were originally painted with black or red designs. Such ornaments are found in the thousands and may have been worn, broken and discarded much as glass bangles are used today throughout the subcontinent. (Terracotta bangles were worn.Inscribed stoneware bangles are too small in size and which could have been worn not as bangles as writlets or armlets, but tied with bands like fillets worn by th priest-king of Mohenjo-daro or as pendants on necklaces).

"The Burney Relief (also known as the Queen of the Night relief) is aMesopotamian terracotta plaque in high relief of the Isin-Larsa- or OldBabylonian period, depicting a winged, nude, goddess-like figure with bird's talons, flanked by owls, and perched upon two lions. The relief is displayed in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750 BCE. It originates from southern Iraq, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it was used as a cultrelief, making it a very rare survival from the period.

Gundestrup Cauldron Peat bog, Gundestrup (Denmark) First century B.C.E. Silver partially gilded. Diameter 69cm., Height 42cm.Copenhagen, Nationalmuseet.
The Gundestrup Cauldron is a religious vessel found in Himmerland, Denmark, 1891. It was deposited in a dry section of a peat bog, dismantled with its five long rectangular plates, seven short ones and one round plate. Each plate is made of 97.0% pure silver and filled with various motifs of animals, plants and pagan deities. Sophius Müller(1892) reconstructed these plates into the present form of the cauldron: five rectangular plates are placed in the inside of the cauldron leaving 2cm of space between each, and the seven (originally eight) plates form the outside of the cauldron. The round plate is assumed as the base of the cauldron. The reconstructed cauldron with its spherical base and cylindrical side is 69cm. in diameter and



46
42cm. high; both the inner and outer plates are almost of the same height ( about 21cm) forming the cylindrical side of the cauldron. As the largest surviving piece of Europian Iron Age silver work, the Gundestrup Cauldron has been given a special interest by many scholars. Especially, its high quality workmanship and iconographic variety have generated an incessant inquiry into the origin of the cauldron. Though the date of the cauldron is generally attributed to the 2nd or 1st century BCE (La Tène III), there still remains much room for controversy concerning the place of its manufacture. The main problem comes from the fact that its style and workmanship is Thracian rather than Celtic despite its decorative motifs manifestly Celtic. So far, scholastic opinions have been largely divided into two groups: those who argue for the Gaulish origin and those who argue for the Thracian origin. The former locate the manufacture of the cauldron in the Celtic west while the latter opt for the Lower Danube in southeastern Europe.
"The proponents of the Gaulish origin put emphasis on the Celtic motifs depicted on the cauldron such as ahorned deity, torques and musical instruments called carnyx. Most representative of all, Klindt-Jensen (KlindtJensen, O., 1959, "The Gundestrup Bowl-a reassessment," Antiquity, vol.33, pp.161-9.) sees a horned deity as Cernnunos, the Celtic god and argues that it points toward northern Gaul as the area of its origin...The Gundestrup cauldron is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work (diameter 69 cm, height 42 cm). The style and workmanship suggest Thracian origin, while the imagery seems Celtic. This has opened room for conflicting theories of Thracian vs. Gaulish origin of the cauldron. Taylor (1991) has suggested Thracian origin with influence by Indian iconography." http://www.native-science.net/gundestrup-cauldron.htm
The Base. I suggest that the base which is the centre-piece of the entire narrative of Gundestrup Cauldron has hypertexts which signify a smithy/forge of a blacksmith.

Plate A "This plate shows a variety of animals around the horned figure in the center. The horned figure is presented with his legs folded and wears a torque around his neck. he holds another torque in his right hand and a



50
horned serpent in his left hand. This torque-wearing god with stag antlers is generally identified as the Celtic god, Cernunnos. Cernunnnos is the Lord of the animals and the torques he wears are the symbols of wealth and prosperity. Cernunnos was first recognized by the inscription of the Paris monument which, along with the inscription, shows a horned deity wearing torques on his antlers. Because of this antlered deity, this plate has often been cited by those who argue for the Gaulish origin...Apart from the identity of the horned deity, it is recognized, however, that the posture and dress of the figure are not necessarily Celtic. His folded legs seen from above hint at the possible link with Buddhism in the East and his costume tight-fitting breeches and coat fastened by a belt at the waist - is often matched by the costumes of horse-riding races from southeastern Europe."

The pillar provides the only undisputed instance of the divine name Cernunnos (Koch 2006, p. 396). The Gaulish theonyms are presented as deity names in their own right, and not as epithets for Roman gods (by contrast, see the many Celtic gods syncretized with Mars). Other figures appear on the pillar without legible inscriptions, including the Roman gods Mars and Mercury, who can be identified by their conventional iconography, and other unidentified figures, mainly female.
Similar replica of the ancient Roman gods pillar was found in Nijmegen, Netherlands, a municipality and a city in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is situated on the Waal river, close to the German border. Nijmegen

About 40 attested Cernunnos divinity have been found in Celtic tradition. (Green, Miranda, Celtic Art, Reading the Messages, p. 147, 1996, The Everyman Art Library).
The name has been compared to a divine epithet Carnonos in a Celtic inscription written in Greek characters at Montagnac, Hérault (as καρνονου, karnonou, in the dative case). (Xavier Delamarre, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (Éditions Errance, 2003), pp. 106–107). A GalloLatin adjective carnuātus, "horned," is also found.(Equivalent to Latin cornutus, "horned"; Delamarre, citing J. Vendryes, Revue Celtique 42 (1925) 221–222.)

Kernunno or Cernunnos sculpted on the Pillar of Boatmen or Pilier des Nautes -- ca.1 BCE.by nautae Parisiaci -- at the Musée Carnavalet is composed of Indus Script hieroglyph components: horns of antelope (markhor), torcs, seated person in penance, surrounded by other metalwork hieroglyphs.
Discovered under the Cathedral Notre-Dame De Paris, the pillar is an offering of the boatmen of the Seine (the nautes) to the Roman Emperor Tiberius who ruled the Gaul (Roman Province). The pillar was originally in a temple in the Gallo-Roman civitas of Lutetia (modern Paris, France).

Cernunnos is named in an inscription on the 1st cent. CE Pillar of the Boatmen (French Pilier des nautes) with bas-relief depictions. "Dating to the first quarter of the 1st century AD, it originally stood in a temple in the Gallo-Roman civitas of Lutetia (modern Paris, France) and is one of the earliest pieces of representational Gaulish art to carry a written inscription...It is displayed in the frigidarium of the Thermes de Cluny...Cernunnos has stag's antlers from which hang two torcs. From the amount of the body in the top half, Cernunnos is assumed to have been



61
depicted in a cross-legged seated position...Smertrios is shown kneeling, brandishing a club and attacking a snake. Castor and Pollus are shown standing beside their horses, each holding a spear...Jupiter is shown standing, holding a spear and a thunderbolt. Esus is shown standing beside a willow tree, which he is cutting down with an axe. Tarvos Trigaranus is depicted as a large, heavy-set bull standing in front of a willow tree. Two cranes stand on his back and a third on his head. Vulcan is shown standing, with hammer and tongs."
The pillar is made of a type of limestone called "pierre de Saint-Leud'Esserent", from Saint-Leu, Oise, France. The original pillar would have been 5.24m high, 0.91m wide at the base and 0.74m wide at the top (Saragoza 2003). It is formed in four tiers. The top tier, of which only the top half remains, depicts Cernunnos, Smertrios, and Castor and Pollux. Cernunnos has stag's antlers from which hang two torcs. From the amount of the body in the top half, Cernunnos is assumed to have been depicted in a cross-legged seated position as is typical of other Cernunnos depictions (Bober, Phyllis Fray,1951,. "Cernunnos: Origin and Transformation of a Celtic Divinity". American Journal of Archaeology. Archaeological Institute of America. 55 (1): 13–51. pp. 14, 19, 21–24); there is insufficient room for him to be seated on a chair or standing (Bober opcit., p. 30). Smertrios is shown kneeling, brandishing a club and attacking a snake. Castor and Pollux are shown standing beside their horses, each holding a spear (Busson, Didier (1998). Carte archéologique de la Gaule: 75, Paris. Paris: Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.p.451. Entry on Notre-Dame, includes detailed photos and line drawings, plus a reconstruction of the block ordering.) The second tier, which is complete, shows Jupiter, Esus, Tarvos Trigaranos and Vulcan. Jupiter is shown standing, holding a spear and a thunderbolt. Esus is shown standing beside a willow tree, which he is cutting down with an axe. Tarvos Trigaranus is depicted as a large, heavy-set bull standing in front of a willow tree. Two cranes stand on his back and a third on his head. Vulcan is shown standing, with hammer and tongs (Busson opcit.,pp. 449–450). Inscription
Written in Latin with some Gaulish language features, the inscription mingles Roman deities with gods that are distinctly Gallic. The pillar is dated by a dedication to Tiberius Caesar Augustus, that is, Tiberius, who became emperor in 14 AD. It was set up publicly (publice posierunt) by the guild of sailors of Lutetia, from the civitas of the Parisii (nautae Parisiaci). These sailors would have been merchants who travelled along the Seine. The main dedication is to Jupiter, in the form of Iovis Optimus Maximus ("Jove Best and Greatest"). The names of the emperor and the



62
supreme deity appear in the dative case as the recipients of the dedication. The remaining theonyms are nominative legends that accompany individual depictions of the gods. These are (in the order they appear below) Jove, Tarvos Trigaranos (the Bull with three Cranes), Volcanus (Vulcan), Esus, Cernunnos, Castor, Smertrios, and Fortuna. The dedication (CIL XIII, 3026; RIG L2-1) is as follows: Tib(erio) Caesare / Aug(usto) Ioui Optum[o] / Maxsumo / nautae Parisiaci / publice posierunt // Eurises // Senan[t] U[s]e[t]lo[n][-] // Iouis // Taruos Trigaranus // Volcanus // Esus // [C]ernunnos // Castor // [---] // Smer[---] // Fort[una] // [--]TVS[--] // D[--]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillar_of_the_Boatmen Esus always conquers the divine bull, but Tarvos is always reborn from mother earth. https://www.tarvos.nl/contactgegevens/pillar-of-the-boatmen/esus-entarvos-trigaranus
The two reliefs from the Pillar of Boatmen of Notre-Dame de Paris are inscribed "ESVS" and "TARVOSTRIGARANOS". There is also a third relief of a horned god, called Cernunnos (inscribed "(K)ERNENOS"), and a relief of Smertios, a god holding a club, about to kill a snake. Aside from these, there are also reliefs of Vulcan, Jupiter, and Mars.

Three-hornedd bull. http://www.monde.de/tarvos.html "At the Roman temple in Maiden Castle (Dorset), there was found a bronze bull with three horns and three women on his back. Some have speculated that this was a Mithraic object, and the similarity between the bronze bull and the reliefs are unmistakable. And what is most important is that Mithraism is based around the belief that Mithra slew the cosmic bull; also, the earliest grade of Mithraism was Corax--the crow, who is perched on the bull's back: Mithras is clad in a tunic, trousers, cloak, and a pointed cap usually called a Phrygian cap. He faces the viewer while half-straddling the back of a bull, yanks the bull's head back by its nostrils with his left hand, and plunges a dagger into the bull's thoat with his right. Various figures surround this dramatic event. Under the bull a dog laps at the blood dripping from the wound and a scorpion attacks the bull's testicles. Often the bull's tail ends in wheat ears and a raven is perched on the bull's back. On the viewer's left stands a diminutive male figure named Cautes, wearing the same garb as Mithras and holding an upraised and burning torch. Above him, in the upper left corner, is the sun god, Sol, in his chariot. On the viewer's left there is another diminutive male figure, Cautopates, who is also clad as Mithras is and holds a torch that points downards and is sometimes, but not always, burning. Above Cautopates in the upper right corner is the moon, Luna. This group of figures is almost always present, but there are variations, of which the most common is an added line of the signs of the zodiac over the top of the bull-sacrificing scene. --A typical mithraeum. (Griffin,Alison,Mithraism)" loc. cit.

The relief of Tarvos or TaruosTrigaranus on the Pillar of the Boatmen. Taros Trigaranus is a bull with three cranesperched on his back. He stands under a tree, and on an adjacent panel, the god Esus is chopping down a tree, possibly a willow, with an axe. (Green, Miranda J. (1992) Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend. London: Thames & Hudson, pp. 93-94).
"Reliefs from a pillar dedicated to
Jupiter by the 'Parisian mariners' between AD 14 and 37 and rediscovered in 1711 under the choir of the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. One shows the god Esus cutting branches from a tree. In the other there is a similar tree with a bull surmounted by three birds. It bears the title Tarvos Trigaranus, 'The Bull with Three Cranes'. That these two adjacent scenes belong together is confirmed by a relief from Treves (page 35) in which a man, similarly dressed in short working tunic, appears to be hacking the



65
trunk of a tree in whose foliage are visible the head of a bull and the same three birds. These three components, the sacred tree, the divine bull and the triad of otherworld birds, are familiar features of insular Celtic tradition, and obviously we have to do here wit some episode from a myth. Unfortunately its precise content can only be conjectured. Musee de Cluny, Paris."
(Mac Cana, page 35)
The relief from Treves which corresponds to the Paris reliefs of Esus and Tarvos Trigaramus. It shows a woodcutter attacking a tree on which repose three birds and the head of a bull. Landes-museum, Trier.
The American Journal of Archaeology [Vol. 1, No. 4/5 (July-Oct. 1897) pp 333-387] mentions this second relief of Esus, having this to say on the subject on p. 374-375: "From Differten comes a sandstone relief of Mercury in Gallic costume, with herald's staff and purse, an illustration of Caesar's remark that Mercury was especially honored by the Gauls. Most important is a Gallo-Roman votive monument dedicated to Mercury by the Mediomatrician Indus. On the front, on either side of an open box, stand Mercury, with winged shoes and Gallic collar, and his Gallic mate Rosmerta. On the right side, next to Mercury, is



66
the Gallic god Esus felling a tree, above which appear a bull's head and three large birds, symbols of the god Tarvos Trigaranus, as seen on an altar at Paris. The monument is evidence of the identity of Esus and Mercury." http://www.chronarchy.com/esus/aboutesus.html In the Gaulish language, taruos means "bull," in Latin, it is taurus, Lithuanian tauras. kaṅká m. ʻ heron ʼ VS.

Plate B
"This plate shows an antithetical arrangement of animals around a bust of a goddess. The goddess is presented in the center with a six-spoked rosette wheel on either side of her. She is flanked by two elephants confronting each other. Below them are two griffins arranged in the same antithetical manner and a hound is placed in the lower center of the plate, between these two griffins. The goddess seems almost identical with the goddess on plate (g): she has S-curve hair strands and curvilinear eye-ridges forming a T-shape with her nose. The rendering of her arms is also similar to that on plate (e). Though it is not certain that the six-pointed wheels represent a wagon, the goddess is usually interpreted as riding a wagon. Actually, a chariot is often represented by a single wheel of the same type in Gaulish coinage. Olmsted suggests that the presence of the elephants on either side of the wagon could have resulted from the influences of the Roman coinage which portrays elephants pulling a chariot. "

Under this leaping figure, a horned serpent is presented. The rest of animals are placed clockwise around this group of two deities: in the upper part of the plate, two identical beasts are depicted on either side of the group, both facing the left side of the deities and in the lower part, three griffins are depicted in parallel, all facing the right side of the deities. The space between the upper and lower group of the animals is filled with some botanical patterns which are usually identified as ivy tendrils. The bust of a bearded god in the center is almost identical with the small bust on the right shoulder of the goddess on plate (e). On the other hand, the leaping figure holding the wheel on the left is similar to the gods of the plate (A) and (E) in its size and dress. He wears tight fitting, shortsleeve clothes and a horned helmet ending in knob like terminals."

Plate D "On the lower right side of each bull, a man is standing in the posture of attacking the bull with a sword. Under the feet of each bull, by the side of each man, a dog is depicted as running toward the left while a cat-like creature is running in the same direction over the back of the bull. These cats as well as the dogs have the same hanging feet. As shown in other plates, the spaces between each figure are filled with tear-drop shaped leaves."

Plate E "Along with the plate (A), plate (E) is said to be the most Celtic in its iconography because of the presence of the carnyx. It consists of a long thin tube at the top of which is added a boar’s head with jaws wide open and a projecting mane on the back. The decorated helmets of the warriors in the upper row are also Celtic. Here, we have five different types of helmets: one has a boar on top, one a pair of crooked thin horns ending in knobs, one a crescent shape with concave side down, one a bird with its wings folded."
Outer plate a "On
plate (a), a bearded god holds a small man in each hand over his shoulders. He is in so-called "orans position"with his arms raised. Like another male
god on plate (d), he doesn’t wear a torque; instead he has long whisker-like strings. Each of the two men seems to hold a boar with one of their arms. However, from a closer view, one can recognize that each one reaches his hand upward to a boar and just touches it. The one on the right has a dog

Outer plate b "Plate (b)
shows a male deity holding two sea horses or dragons. These two animals have the mixed characters of horse and dragon; they have a long, serpentine body of a dragon and a horse-like head and two front legs. Their ribs are prominently fluted and the tails and wings are swirled. Below the god is a double-headed monster attacking small figures of fallen men...as early as 1913, Hubert suggested that this scene should be related to the sea or water since the god holds the sea horses.

iconographic details of this plate are comparatively clear: a bearded god is holding two stags in each hand. Stylistically, this plate share some characteristics with the plates (e) and (g): all of them have a dotted background which ends in a zig-zag boundary at the top of the plate and ivy tendrils which fill the empty spaces between the figures. Since boars and stags were the major animals revered by the Celts, one may argue for the Gaulish character of this plate. "

shows an interesting iconography. The central goddess holds a small bird in her upraised right hand while her left arm is placed across her chest. Crossed over her left arm is lying a small man and on the opposite side to the man is a dog upside down. Some have suggested that the goddess is cradling the two figures on her chest. But this would hardly be the case because the figures are depicted as fallen rather than cradled.(Davison: 498) The goddess has two birds of prey - which may be eagles or ravens on either side of her head. On her right shoulder is seated a small female figure, over whose head is a lion-like animal runs. On the left side, another small figure is holding the hair of the goddess as if plaiting her hair. Olmsted notes that the small bird in her right hand is same as that on the helmet on plate (E): both are seen from the side with a head like those of the larger birds but with a straight beak and their almond shaped wings are folded."

The man on the right is often associated with a motif borrowed from the theme of Heracles and the Nemean Lion. However, it is a widespread motif of ancient times which can be traced back beyond classical art to Near Eastern and oriental prototypes. ..The proponents of the Gaulish origin put emphasis on the Celtic motifs depicted on the cauldron such as ahorned deity, torques and musical instruments called carnyx. Most representative of all, Klindt-Jensen (1959) sees a horned deity as Cernnunos, the Celtic god and argues that it points toward northern Gaul as the area of its origin.

Bringing our offerings to the Gods' assembly, he moves as Chief in his own dwellingplaces-. 3 Him who hath grasped his Parents' head, they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre. In his swift flight the red Dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of Order. 4 For, Vasu thou precedest every Morning, and still hast been the Twins' illuminator. For sacrifice, seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest Mitra. 5 Thou art the Eye and Guard of mighty Order, and Varuna when to sacrifice thou comest. Thou art the Waters Child O Jatavedas, envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest. 6 Thou art the Leader of the rite and region, to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest, Thy lightbestowing- head to heaven thou liftest, making thy tongue the oblationbearer, Agni. 7 Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sires' intention, Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin, goes forth to combat. 8 Wellskilled- to use the weapons of his Father, Aptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle. Then Trita slew the foe sevenrayed-, threeheaded-, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tvastar. 9 Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty. He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the oniniform Son of Tvastar.

Executive summary note on Trita Āptya (explained Arthur Berriedale Keith and KE Eduljee)



91
A recurrent metaphor related to soma pressing or processing is the release of 'waters.
आप्तत्य is N. of इतद्र RV. x , 120 , 6; m. N. of त्रत्रत RV.; derived from आप ् to
obtain , gain , take possession of RV. AV. &c MBh. Mn. &c . This root is a pun
on the word आप n. (fr. 2. अप ् Pa1n2. 4-2 , 37), a quantity of water
, म्न्लनाथ on मशशुपाल-वध iii , 72. Thus, Trita Āptya, as an early Soma presser,
gets associated with 'release of waters' which is a metaphor for 'pressing of
Soma'. आप m. N. of one of the eight demigods called वसुs VP. Hariv. MBh.
thus, associates Soma with obtaining vasu, dhanam or wealth.
Trita Āptya is one of the first pressers of Soma -- perhaps the third.
Trita is the third presser of Soma. The other two are: Vivasvat
or Vivanghvant (Yima's, Manu's father) and Aptya = आप्ततव्य q.v. RV. v , 41 ,
9 or Athwya (Trita's father). This is according to Avesta's Yasna 9.7 & 10, the context is 'healing'. Perhaps the son of Tvaṣṭr̥, Viśvarupa (three-headed snake person) is also a presser of Soma who was killed by Trita and beheaded by Indra. Thus, the three early pressers of Soma are:
1. Viśvarupa, 2. Trita and 3. Trita's father Athwya or Aptya (a synonym
of Apām Napāt ). In the Rig Veda, Apām Napāt (Lord Varuna) is the angel of rain. Apām Napāt created all existential beings (Rig Veda 2.35.2)[2] . In Zoroastrianism, Apąm Napāt is a divinity of water (water vapour). [quote] No hymn survives in his honor, bur he is mentioned in hymns devoted to other divinities of water. Thus there is an obscure reference to him in Yašt 5 (v. 72), a hymn addressed to the river-goddess, Arədvī Sūrā; and in Yašt 8, which is devoted to the rain-bringer, Tištrya, it is said in one verse (v. 34): “Apąm Napāt distributes to the material world those waters assigned to dwelling places,” while in another (v. 4) worshippers offer veneration to Tištrya “from whom, the lofty one, is fame, from Apąm Napāt is (his) nature.”[unquote] http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/apam-napat
The metallurgical process is elaborated in metaphors related to Ahi, the snake, to free the 'waters'. 'Waters' signify wealth, purification of Soma as a product of value.
Trita wins over Ahi, the snake. In the early Vedic
religion, Vṛtra (Sanskrit: वत्रृ , vṛtra, lit. 'enveloper') is a serpent or dragon,
the personification of drought and adversary of Indra. In Hinduism, Vṛtra is identified as an Asura. Vritra was also known in



92
the Vedas as Ahi (Sanskrit: अहि ahi, lit. 'snake'). He appears as a dragon
blocking the course of the rivers and is heroically slain by Indra.
In the Avesta, it is the hero warrior-priest Fereydun who battles the serpent Aži Dahāka (which, for the virtue of 'Azi' being cognate with Sanskrit 'Ahi', snake, is – by proponents of the theory - associated with Vedic Vritra).
In RV 10.99.6 Trita slew the seven-rayed, three-headed foe and freed the cattle of Tvastar's son (Viśwarupa): Lord of the dwelling, he subdued the demon who roared aloud, sixeyed- and tripleheaded-. Trita, made stronger by the might he lent him, struck down the boar with shaft whose point was iron.
Trita kills Visvarupa, Indra beheads him.

The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads, Part 1
Arthur Berriedale Keith
Motilal Banarsidass Publishe, 1925, pp. 134-135.
Trita ("the Third") is a minor deity of the Rigveda, mentioned 41 times. He is associated with the Maruts, with Vayu and with Indra, like Indra, or as Indra's assistant, fighting Tvastar, Vrtra and Vala. He is called Āptya, the deity of the Apas (waters).
In RV 1.105, Trita fallen into a well begs aid from the gods. Sayana on 1.105 comments that this relates to three rishis, Ekata, Dvita and Trita who found a well, and Trita, drawing water, was pushed down by the other two and imprisoned, where he composed a hymn to the gods, and managed miraculously to prepare the sacrificial Soma; this is alluded to in RV 9.34.4 and described in Mahabharata 9.2095.

Eduljee's notes on Trita Āptya with particular reference to Avestan texts and tradition
Pahlavans & Sakastan 4. Thraetaona & Thrita. Keresaspa & Urvakhshaya. Varena, Rangha & Patashkhvargar
In nine parts: » 1. Introduction » 2. Timur's Account » 3. Lineage & Nation » 4. Thraetaona & Thrita. Keresaspa & Urvakhshaya. Varena, Rangha & Patashkhvargar » 5. Trita, Visvarupa & Ahi in the Vedas » 6. Battles with Dragon-Snakes » 7. Garshasp, Saam & Zal in the Shahnameh » 8. End Times. The Renovation of the World » 9. Religion in Sakastan
The Avestan Thraetaona is commonly identified with the Feridoon of more modern texts including the Shahnameh. The is another personage mentioned in the Avesta called Thrita. Authors commonly equate Thraetaona and Thrita thereby making Thrita yet another Avestan name for Feridoon. However, are Thraetaona and Thrita the same or different individuals? In examining references to these two individuals we come across mention of Urvakhshaya and Keresaspa. The former is only vaguely known while the latter has a fair amount of literature developed around his identification and reputation. We will examine some of the information at hand.
Thraetaona is mentioned ten times in the Yashts, while the Yashts mention Thrita twice. Thrita is mentioned twice again in the Avesta. Once, in the Vendidad at chapter 20 and next in the Yasna at 9.10. In the Yasna, both Thraetaona & Thrita are mentioned in consecutive verses with no indication that they are the same person. The only link between the two seems to be a similarity in names. Yet other reference seem to indicate that they share characteristics.
Yasna 9.7: Thereupon Haoma answered: Athwya the holy one who drove death afar was the second (person) who prepared me for the corporeal world. The boon he received was the birth of his son, Thraetaona of the mighty clan.
Yasna 9.10: Thereupon Haoma answered: Thrita the holy one who drove death afar was the third (person) who prepared me for the corporeal world. The boon he received was the birth of two sons, Urvakhshaya and Keresaspa, the first a judge who established order, and the second, a youth of great ascendancy, curly haired, and a bludgeon bearing.

Here, the only way we can link Thraetaona & Thrita as being the same person is if Thrita is a nickname for Thraetaona. Both are immortalized for advancing the health benefits of Haoma. If they are different, then it is Thraetaona who preceded Thrita as a healer. Further, Vivanghant is mentioned before both of them as the first person to prepare Haoma for the corporeal world. Pourushaspa, Zarathushtra's father is the fourth and last person immortalized for this deed. Medieval author Hamza Isfahani makes Thraetaona the inventor of medicine (Ed Gottwaldt, p. 23; cf. Mirkhond, Early Kings of Persia, tr. by Shea, p. 152) further stating that the Tavids (formulas of exorcism) against sickness are inscribed with his name.
We see in Yasna 9.10, Urvakhshaya (Urvakhsh in the Bundahishn) is mentioned before Keresaspa, indicating the possibility that the former is the latter's elder brother. Urvakhshaya is described as a judge who established order and we might conclude that in addition to law and order, he is a promoter of justice as well. The name Urva-khshaya can be taken to mean king of the soul (such an analysis is not always helpful as it has the potential of being distracting or irrelevant). The Afrin Zarthusht states, "Be beneficent and open-hearted like Urvakhshaya" given us a couple of character traits.
The Vendidad's chapter 20 mentions Thrita as the first healer without mentioning the others: 1. Who was he who first of the healers*, of the wise, the happy, the wealthy, the glorious, the strong, the Paradhatas**, drove back sickness to sickness, drove back death to death; and first turned away the point of a knife***, the fire of fever from the bodies of mortals?' (*While the Yasna passages above place Thrita as the third healer, here we have him proclaimed as the first.) (**The first law-givers, the Paradhatas - in later language Pishdadian - dynasty.) (***likely meaning a surgeon.)
2. Thrita was the first of the healers, of the wise, the happy, the wealthy, the glorious, the strong, the Paradhatas, drove back sickness to sickness, drove back death to death, and first turned away the point of the knife and the fire of fever from the bodies of mortals.
3. He asked for a source of remedies; he obtained it from KhshathraVairya*, to withstand sickness and to withstand death; to withstand pain and to withstand fever; to withstand Sarana (headache) and to withstand Sarastya (cold-fever); to withstand Azana and to withstand Azahva; to withstand Kurugha and to withstand Azivaka; to withstand Duruka and to withstand Astairya; to withstand the evil eye, rot, and infection which inflict the bodies of mortals. (*Perhaps indicating the use of metal knives in surgery since metals are in the domain of Khshathra-Vairya.)

4. And Ahura Mazda brought down the healing plants that, by many hundreds, by many thousands, by many myriads, grow up all around the one Gaokerena.
The Farvardin Yasht at 13.131 states: We revere the Fravashi of the holy Thraetaona, of the Athwya house; whose cures combated itch, hot fever, humours, cold fever, and incontinence, and the poison of the serpent.
Albert Pike in Irano-Aryan Faith and Doctrine As Contained in the ZendAvesta states that Sama in Sanskrit means 'cure' and pra-samaya means 'to heal', concluding thereby that Samas means healer. This reference to Sanskrit brings us to our examination of the Vedas.
Parallels in the Hindu Scriptures, the Vedas
According to James Darmesteter in the introduction to his translation of the Vendidad, quotes the Rig Veda at 1.158.5 and 10.99.6 as saying, Traitana or Trita (meaning third) Aptya (born of the waters) vanquished the threeheaded, six-eyed fiend (Ahi) and freed the kine (as in RV 10.8.8: Well-skilled to use the weapons of his father, Aptya, and urged on by Indra, (Trita) fought the battle. Then Trita slew the seven-rayed, three-headed foe and freed the cattle of Tvastar's son. 10.99.6. Lord of the dwelling, he subdued the demon who roared aloud, six-eyed and triple-headed. Trita, made stronger by the might he (Indra) lent him, struck down the boar with shaft whose point was iron). The slaying of a snake or dragon appears to have a parallel in the Avestan account of Thraetaona Athwya slaying the threeheaded, six-eyed Azi Dahak (Zahhak). Trita's title Aptya appears to be a contraction of Apam Napat, progeny of the waters. Apam Napat is found both in the Vedas and the Avesta. Yasht 8.34 state that Apam Napat divides the waters amongst the countries in the material world. If these events in the Vedas and the Avesta are indeed congruent as appears apparent, then the Vedic Trita appears to be congruent with the Avestan Thraetaona. Vedic Trita and the Avestan Thrita also appear to be congruent which by analogy makes Thraetaona another name for Thrita.
The first to prepare Soma in the Rig Veda are Vivasvat, who is the father of Yama and Manu, and Trita (son of Aptya).
Thraetaona's Domicile & Theatre of Events:
Varena, Rangha & Patashkhvargar/ Padashkhvargar



101
While much of the Avesta's geography and legends have their theatre in the east of Aryana, Thraetaona's area of domicile is stated in Vendidad 1.17 to be in Verena (W. Mazandaran, Gilan, otherwise known
as Dailam or Tabaristan) in the west of Aryana: "The fourteenth of the good lands and countries... was the four-cornered Varena, where Thraetaona (Feridoon), who smote Azi Dahaka (Zahhak) was born." Thraetaona/Feridoon has his capital at in eastern Mazandaran at Tammisha (Kus) between Sariyeh and Gorgan/Astarabad at the southeast corner of the Caspian Sea. The highest mountain peak in the Alburz Mountain, Damavand Mountain is where Thraetaona/Feridoon bound and imprisoned Azi Dahaka (Zahhak) and was said to have been located in or near the land of Patashkhvargar/ Padashkhvargar.
Thraetaona/Feridoon was aided in defeating Azi Dahaka (Zahhak) by the blacksmith Kaveh who the Kurds claim as one of their own. Kurdistan which is today divided between north-western Iran, northern Iraq, south-eastern Turkey and north-eastern Syria, lies in what was the sixteenth and last Vendidad nation, Rangha which is also the Avestan name for the River Tigris (Arvand in Middle Persian). The Rangha also features as the place where Keresaspa prayed for the ability to avenge the death of his brother Urvakhshaya, an event recorded in the Ram Yasht at 15.27-8: The manlyhearted Keresaspa offered prayers by the Mazda given Gudha, a channel of the Rangha, upon a golden throne, under golden beams and a golden canopy, with bundles of baresma and offerings of full boiling [milk]. He implored a boon be granted, saying: Grant me this, that I may succeed in avenging my brother Urvakhshaya, that I may smite Hitaspa and yoke him to my chariot. The Gandarewa, who lives beneath the waters, the progeny of Ahura in the deep, he is the only master of the deep. (Given what we read below about Gandarewa, this translation bears scrutiny. The implication is that Urvakhshaya, Keresaspa's brother was killed by Hitaspa. The context for mentioning Gandarewa needs further scrutiny.)
Rangha is mentioned nine time in the Yashts some times with names of apparent tributaries: Aban Yt. 5.81. Yoishta, one of the Fryanas, offer prayers... on the Pedvaepa of the Rangha.
Meher Yt. 10.104. ...the eastern-most river and... the westernmost river, that which is the Sanaka of the Rangha by the boundary of the earth.
Rashne Yasht 12.11, 12. ...Aodhas of the Rangha, ...Sanaka of the Rangha.

Pahlavans & Sakastan 5. Trita, Visvarupa & Ahi in the Vedas

The Avestan Thraetaona and Thrita likely have parallels in the Hindu scriptures' personages of Traitana or Trita (Trita is said to mean third*). Scholars commonly equate Thraetaona with Thrita and Traitana with Trita. These Avestan and Vedic personages are said to share so many characteristics and roles in their respective mythologies, that they are identified as having common origins from the era when the two traditions were undivided. Nevertheless, it is odd that two names are used to define the same person. In the case of the Avesta, Thraetaona and Thrita are mentioned in consecutive verse of the same chapter - as if referring to two different individuals. (*In the Brahmanas, Trita is the third of three brothers: Ekata, Dvita and Trita - which sounds like first, second and third.)
When comparing passages in the Avesta and the Rig Veda, at the outset we find that Thraetaona is the son of Athwya while Trita is the son of Aptya. Some authors see Aptya as a contraction of Apam Napat, progeny of the waters. Apam Napat is found both in the Vedas and the Avesta. Yasht 8.34 state that Apam Napat divides the waters amongst the countries in the material world. The clan of Aptyas (who are also classified as water deities) were created by Agni.
Next, we find that in the Avesta's Yasna 9.7 & 10, Vivanghvant (Yima's father) Athwya (Thraetaona's father) and Thrita (Urvakhshaya and Keresaspa's father) are among the first three preparers of haoma, while in the Rig Veda, the first preparers of Soma are Vivasvat (Yama and Manu's father) and Trita (son of Aptya).
Perhaps, the most cited congruence between these Avestan and Vedic personages are the battles our stalwarts waged with an evil three-headed, six-eyed snake (often - perhaps incorrectly - translated as a dragon). In Zoroastrian literature, the snake is named Azi and Baevareaspa/Bivarasp/Pivarasp or Dahak (Zahhak), while in the Vedas, the snake is named Ahi and Visvarupa.

The Killing and Beheading of Visvarupa - the Snake-Like Fiend with Three Heads Rig Veda Passages
[Adapted by this author from translations by Ralph T Griffith at ancientvoice. In the English transliteration of the nouns we find the following names Trita (29 occurrences), Trta (11 occurrences) and Traitana (1 occurrence).] RV 2.11.18. Hero, assume the might with which you extol Vrtra piecemeal, the Danava Aurnavabha. You have disclosed the light to light the Arya on your left hand - O Indra (you) sank the Dasyu. RV 2.11.19. May we gain wealth, subduing with your help and with the Arya, all our foes, the Dasyus. Our gain was that to Trita of our party you gave up Tvastars' son Visvarupa (the three headed snake-person). RV 2.11.20. He (Indra?) cast down Arbuda, his vigour strengthened by libations poured by Trita. Indra sent forth his whirling wheel like Surya, and then aided by the Angirases, rent Vala. RV 2.11.21. Now let that wealthy cow of yours, O Indra, yield in return a boon to him who praises you. Give to your praisers; let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with brave men, in the assembly.
RV 1.158. When Traitana split my (Visvarupa speaking?) head asunder, the Dasa wounded his own breast and shoulders.
RV 10.8.7. Through his wise insight, Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sires' intention, having carefully been tended in his parents' bosom, called the weapons' kin, and went forth to combat. 10.8.8. Urged on by Indra and well-skilled in the use of his father Aptya's weapons, (Trita) fought the battle. Then Trita slew the seven-rayed, three-headed foe (Visvarupa) and freed the kine (cattle) of Tvastar's son (Visvarupa). RV 10.8.9. Then the Lord of the brave, Indra, split him (the fallen Visvarupa killed by Trita) in pieces - he who sought to gain much strength and deemed himself mighty. He (Indra) severed his (Visvarupa's) three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the omniform son of Tvastar. [O’Flaherty (1975) at p.71 interprets these verses as: Trita Aptya, sent by Indra, slew the three-headed one, (and then) Indra beheaded Visvarupa, cutting off his three-heads. Here, while Trita kills Visvarupa, Indra beheads him. This is the sole Rig Vedic reference to the killing of Visvarupa.]
RV 10.99.6. The lord of the dwelling, he (Trita) subdued the demon who roared aloud - the six-eyed and three-headed (fiend). Trita, (who had been) made stronger by the might he (Indra) lent him, struck down the boar (varaha) with a shaft whose point was (made from) iron (perhaps a spear).



104
(In Yasna 9.8 Thraetaona kills Azi Dahaka who is also described as being three-headed and six-eyed.)
Transfer of the Penalties of Sin
In subsequent texts such as the Atharva Veda, the slaying of Visvarupa by Trita exemplifies how the penalty of a sin can be transferred to others. Visvarupa was a Brahmin and the killing of a Brahmin is a sin, even though the Brahmin might be a demonic threat to Indra. First, Indra gets Trita to do the killing and next the sin was erased and transferred by an appropriate ritualistic and formal offering of prayers (i.e. yajna, often translated as a 'sacrifice'). The Aptyas (the plural might indicate the entire clan) - who were culpable of the sin because they knew Visvarupa was going to be killed - transferred the penalty of the sin to mortals who commit the sin of making ritual offerings without paying a fee to the priest(s). In this entire episode, the credit for killing Visvarupa is taken by Indra while the blame is assigned to Trita and the Aptyas. The Aptyas in turn transfer the penalty for the sin of being a Brahmin-killer to other would-be sinners i.e., those who cheat Brahmins out of their income. It would appear that this acquisition of a sin was a voluntary scheme by the Aptyas, who while divine, were not as divine as Indra, ostensibly, thereby doing him a service. There is a prayer from the Atharva Veda at 6.113 said by people who catch a disease - one that laments: "The gods wiped off their sin on to Trita and Trita wiped it off on to human beings." We think we can say that such a sentiment would be entirely untenable in Zoroastrian ethics. Trita in this episode takes on the unenviable role of being the intermediary through whom the sins of the gods were transferred to humanity - and thereby the cause of human suffering, which is curious because the Avestan Thrita is a healer par excellence. We read (Westergaard in Ind. Studien and Dr. Haug in Essay on the Sacred Writings...at p. 235) that the Vedic Trita was also a healer, though the references that this author has read are somewhat tenuous. Perhaps the authors are being influenced by the Avestan Thrita.
