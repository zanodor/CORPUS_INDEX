Deer (singular and plural) are the hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae.
The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the
fallow deer, and the chital; and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), the roe
deer, and the moose. Female reindeer, and male deer of all species except the Chinese
water deer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently
horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the same order of
even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla).
The musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia
and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of
tropical African and Asian forests are
separate families within the ruminant
clade (Ruminantia). They are no more
closely related to deer than are other
even-toed ungulates.
Deer appear in art from Paleolithic
cave paintings onwards, and they have
played a role in mythology, religion,
and literature throughout history, as
well as in heraldry. Their economic
importance includes the use of their
meat as venison, their skins as soft,
strong buckskin, and their antlers as
handles for knives. Deer hunting has
been a popular activity since at least
the Middle Ages and remains a
resource for many families today.

Distribution



Chital deer in Nagarahole, India
Deer live in a variety of biomes, ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often
associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas
between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The
majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed
coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world.
Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by
exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that
deer like to eat. Additionally, access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. However,
adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.

Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except
Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the Barbary stag, a
subspecies of red deer that is confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the
continent. However, fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of
brocket deer and pudús of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally
occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception
of the Indian muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized,
and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and "wet" savannas, or
riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in
both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra
and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer
(taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America's Andes fill the ecological niches of the ibex
and wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.
The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the
Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British
Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer,
caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks
including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National
Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park,
Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides.
Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry
subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys
between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The
rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the
subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule
deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to
be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share
with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within
the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land
to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to
grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and
Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland
habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn antelope.

The Eurasian Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of
deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower
diversity in plant and animal species. However, many national parks and protected reserves
in Europe do have populations of red deer, roe deer, and fallow deer. These species have
long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit Asia Minor, the
Caucasus Mountains, and Northwestern Iran. "European" fallow deer historically lived over
much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the
Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day Turkey.
Present-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made
introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually
to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished
themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest
habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct tarpan (forest horse), extinct aurochs
(forest ox), and the endangered wisent (European bison). Good places to see deer in
Europe include the Scottish Highlands, the Austrian Alps, the wetlands between Austria,
Hungary, and the Czech Republic and some fine National Parks, including Doñana National
Park in Spain, the Veluwe in the Netherlands, the Ardennes in Belgium, and Białowieża
National Park of Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains still have
virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other
animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx, wolves,
and brown bears.
The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed
deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea,
Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some
of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find Siberian
roe deer, sika deer, elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this
region along the Sino-Russian border.



Deer such as the sika deer, Thorold's deer, Central Asian red deer, and elk have historically
been farmed for their antlers by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples,
Mongolians, and Koreans. Like the Sami people of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic
peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the
Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.
The highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in
India's Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal's Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of
tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas
that are home to chital, hog deer, barasingha, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Grazing
species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and
live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in
smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer
can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which Kanha National
Park, Dudhwa National Park, and Chitwan National Park are most famous. Sri Lanka's
Wilpattu National Park and Yala National Park have large herds of Indian sambar and chital.
The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and
tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.
The Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist
deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct
Schomburgk's deer, Eld's deer, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and
Eld's deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national
parks, such as Khao Yai. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also
share their habitat with other herbivores, such as Asian elephants, the various Asian
rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as nilgai, four-horned antelope,
blackbuck, and Indian gazelle in India), and wild oxen (such as wild Asian water buffalo,
gaur, banteng, and kouprey). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a
given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be
some overlap.
Australia has six introduced species of deer that have established sustainable wild
populations from acclimatisation society releases in the 19th century. These are the fallow
deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, rusa, and chital. Red deer introduced into New Zealand in
1851 from English and Scottish stock were domesticated in deer farms by the late 1960s
and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into
New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.[1]



Tails of I) white-tailed deer, II) mule deer, III) black-tailed deer, IV) elk, V) red deer
Deer constitute the second most diverse family of artiodactyla after bovids.[2] Though of a
similar build, deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by their antlers, which are
temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horns of bovids.[3] Characteristics
typical of deer include long, powerful legs, a diminutive tail and long ears.[4] Deer exhibit a
broad variation in physical proportions. The largest extant deer is the moose, which is
nearly 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) tall and weighs up to 800 kilograms (1,800 lb).[5][6] The elk
stands 1.4–2 metres (4.6–6.6 ft) at the shoulder and weighs 240–450 kilograms (530
990 lb).[7] On the contrary, the northern pudu is the smallest deer in the world; it reaches
merely 32–35 centimetres (13–14 in) at the shoulder and weighs 3.3–6 kilograms (7.3
13.2 lb). The southern pudu is only slightly taller and heavier.[8] Sexual dimorphism is quite
pronounced – in most species males tend to be larger than females,[9] and, except for the
reindeer, only males possess antlers.[10]
Coat colour generally varies between red and brown,[11] though it can be as dark as
chocolate brown in the tufted deer[12] or have a grayish tinge as in elk.[7] Different species
of brocket deer vary from gray to reddish brown in coat colour.[13] Several species such as
the chital,[14] the fallow deer[15] and the sika deer[16] feature white spots on a brown coat.
Coat of reindeer shows notable geographical variation.[17] Deer undergo two moults in a
year;[11][18] for instance, in red deer the red, thin-haired summer coat is gradually replaced
by the dense, greyish brown winter coat in autumn, which in turn gives way to the summer
coat in the following spring.[19] Moulting is affected by the photoperiod.[20]
Deer are also excellent jumpers and swimmers. Deer are ruminants, or cud-chewers, and
have a four-chambered stomach. Some deer, such as those on the island of Rùm,[21] do
consume meat when it is available.[22]
Description



Play media
A fawn's first steps
Nearly all deer have a facial gland in front of each eye. The gland contains a strongly
scented pheromone, used to mark its home range. Bucks of a wide range of species open
these glands wide when angry or excited. All deer have a liver without a gallbladder. Deer
also have a tapetum lucidum, which gives them sufficiently good night vision.
Antlers
Main article: Antler
White-tailed deer
All male deer possess antlers, with the exception of the water deer, in which males have
long tusk-like canines that reach below the lower jaw.[23] Females generally lack antlers,
though female reindeer bear antlers smaller and less branched than those of the males.[24]
Occasionally females in other species may develop antlers, especially in telemetacarpal
deer such as European roe deer, red deer, white-tailed deer and mule deer and less often
in plesiometacarpal deer. A study of antlered female white-tailed deer noted that antlers
tend to be small and malformed, and are shed frequently around the time of parturition.[25]
The fallow deer and the various subspecies of the reindeer have the largest as well as the
heaviest antlers, both in absolute terms as well as in proportion to body mass (an average
of 8 grams (0.28 oz) per kilogram of body mass);[24][26] the tufted deer, on the other hand,
has the smallest antlers of all deer, while the pudú has the lightest antlers with respect to



body mass (0.6 grams (0.021 oz) per kilogram of body mass).[24] The structure of antlers
show considerable variation; while fallow deer and elk antlers are palmate (with a broad
central portion), white-tailed deer antlers include a series of tines sprouting upward from a
forward-curving main beam, and those of the pudú are mere spikes.[8] Antler development
begins from the pedicel, a bony structure that appears on the top of the skull by the time
the animal is a year old. The pedicel gives rise to a spiky antler the following year, that is
replaced by a branched antler in the third year. This process of losing a set of antlers to
develop a larger and more branched set continues for the rest of the life.[24] The antlers
emerge as soft tissues (known as velvet antlers) and progressively harden into bony
structures (known as hard antlers), following mineralisation and blockage of blood vessels
in the tissue, from the tip to the base.[27]
Antlers might be one of the most exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristics,[28]
and are intended primarily for reproductive success through sexual selection and for
combat. The tines (forks) on the antlers create grooves that allow another male's antlers to
lock into place. This allows the males to wrestle without risking injury to the face.[29]
Antlers are correlated to an individual's position in the social hierarchy and its behaviour.
For instance, the heavier the antlers, the higher the individual's status in the social
hierarchy, and the greater the delay in shedding the antlers;[24] males with larger antlers
tend to be more aggressive and dominant over others.[30] Antlers can be an honest signal
of genetic quality; males with larger antlers relative to body size tend to have increased
resistance to pathogens[31] and higher reproductive capacity.[32]
In elk in Yellowstone National Park, antlers also provide protection against predation by
wolves.[33]
Teeth
Most deer bear 32 teeth; the corresponding dental formula is: 0.0.3.3
3.1.3.3 . The elk and the
reindeer may be exceptions, as they may retain their upper canines and thus have 34 teeth
(dental formula: 0.1.3.3
3.1.3.3).[34] The Chinese water deer, tufted deer, and muntjac have
enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusks, while other species often lack upper
canines altogether. The cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridges of enamel, which enable
them to grind a wide variety of vegetation.[35] The teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on
vegetation, and like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors, instead having a tough pad
at the front of their upper jaw.
Biology



Fawn
Diet
Deer are browsers, and feed primarily on leaves. They have small, unspecialized stomachs
by ruminant standards, and high nutrition requirements. Rather than eating and digesting
vast quantities of low-grade fibrous food as, for example, sheep and cattle do, deer select
easily digestible shoots, young leaves, fresh grasses, soft twigs, fruit, fungi, and lichens.
The low-fibered food, after minimal fermentation and shredding, passes rapidly through
the alimentary canal. The deer require a large amount of minerals such as calcium and
phosphate in order to support antler growth, and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich
diet. There are, however, some reports of deer engaging in carnivorous activity, such as
depredating the nests of Northern bobwhites.[36]
Reproduction
Female elk nursing young
Main article: Rut (mammalian reproduction) § Cervidae
Nearly all cervids are so-called uniparental species: the fawns are only cared for by the
mother, known as a doe. A doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets, while not
unknown, are uncommon). Mating season typically begins in later August and lasts until
December. Some species mate until early March. The gestation period is anywhere up to
ten months for the European roe deer. Most fawns are born with their fur covered with



white spots, though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter.
In the first twenty minutes of a fawn's life, the fawn begins to take its first steps. Its mother
licks it clean until it is almost free of scent, so predators will not find it. Its mother leaves
often to graze, and the fawn does not like to be left behind. Sometimes its mother must
gently push it down with her foot.[37] The fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until
it is strong enough to walk with its mother. The fawn and its mother stay together for about
one year. A male usually leaves and never sees his mother again, but females sometimes
come back with their own fawns and form small herds.
Disease
In some areas of the UK, deer (especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour),
have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of bovine tuberculosis,[38][39]
a disease which in the UK in 2005 cost £90 million in attempts to eradicate.[40] In New
Zealand, deer are thought to be important as vectors picking up M. bovis in areas where
brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula are infected, and transferring it to previously
uninfected possums when their carcasses are scavenged elsewhere.[41] The white-tailed
deer Odocoileus virginianus has been confirmed as the sole maintenance host in the
Michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis which remains a significant barrier to the US
nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock.[42]
Moose and deer can carry rabies.[43]
Docile moose may suffer from brain worm, a helminth which drills holes through the brain
in its search for a suitable place to lay its eggs. A government biologist states that "They
move around looking for the right spot and never really find it." Deer appear to be immune
to this parasite; it passes through the digestive system and is excreted in the feces. The
parasite is not screened by the moose intestine, and passes into the brain where damage
is done that is externally apparent, both in behaviour and in gait.[43]
Deer, elk and moose in North America may suffer from chronic wasting disease, which was
identified at a Colorado laboratory in the 1960s and is believed to be a prion disease. Out
of an abundance of caution hunters are advised to avoid contact with specified risk
material (SRM) such as the brain, spinal column or lymph nodes. Deboning the meat when
butchering and sanitizing the knives and other tools used to butcher are amongst other
government recommendations.[44]
Evolution



Deer are believed to have evolved from antlerless, tusked ancestors that resembled
modern duikers and diminutive deer in the early Eocene, and gradually developed into the
first antlered cervoids (the superfamily of cervids and related extinct families) in the
Miocene. Eventually, with the development of antlers, the tusks as well as the upper
incisors disappeared. Thus evolution of deer took nearly 30 million years. Biologist Valerius
Geist suggests evolution to have occurred in stages. There are not many prominent fossils
to trace this evolution, but only fragments of skeletons and antlers that might be easily
confused with false antlers of non-cervid species.[8][45]
Eocene epoch
The ruminants, ancestors of the Cervidae, are believed to have evolved from Diacodexis,
the earliest known artiodactyl (even-toed ungulate), 50–55 Mya in the Eocene.[46]
Diacodexis, nearly the size of a rabbit, featured the talus bone characteristic of all modern
even-toed ungulates. This ancestor and its relatives occurred throughout North America
and Eurasia, but were on the decline by at least 46 Mya.[46][47] Analysis of a nearly
complete skeleton of Diacodexis discovered in 1982 gave rise to speculation that this
ancestor could be closer to the non-ruminants than the ruminants.[48] Andromeryx is
another prominent prehistoric ruminant, but appears to be closer to the tragulids.[49]
Oligocene epoch
Leptomeryx
The formation of the Himalayas and the Alps brought about significant geographic
changes. This was the chief reason behind the extensive diversification of deer-like forms
and the emergence of cervids from the Oligocene to the early Pliocene.[50] The latter half
of the Oligocene (28–34 Mya) saw the appearance of the European Eumeryx and the North
American Leptomeryx. The latter resembled modern-day bovids and cervids in dental
morphology (for instance, it had brachyodont molars), while the former was more
advanced.[51] Other deer-like forms included the North American Blastomeryx and the
European Dremotherium; these sabre-toothed animals are believed to have been the direct



ancestors of all modern antlered deer, though they themselves lacked antlers.[52] Another
contemporaneous form was the four-horned protoceratid Protoceras, that was replaced by
Syndyoceras in the Miocene; these animals were unique in having a horn on the nose.[45]
Late Eocene fossils dated approximately 35 million years ago, which were found in North
America, show that Syndyoceras had bony skull outgrowths that resembled non
deciduous antlers.[53]
Miocene epoch
Fossil evidence suggests that the earliest members of the superfamily Cervoidea appeared
in Eurasia in the Miocene. Dicrocerus, Euprox and Heteroprox were probably the first
antlered cervids.[54] Dicrocerus featured single-forked antlers that were shed regularly.[55]
Stephanocemas had more developed and diffuse ("crowned") antlers.[56] Procervulus
(Palaeomerycidae), in addition to the tusks of Dremotherium, possessed antlers that were
not shed.[57] Contemporary forms such as the merycodontines eventually gave rise to the
modern pronghorn.[58]
The Cervinae emerged as the first group of extant cervids around 7–9 Mya, during the late
Miocene in central Asia. The tribe Muntiacini made its appearance as † Muntiacus
leilaoensis around 7–8 Mya;[59] The early muntjacs varied in size–as small as hares or as
large as fallow deer. They had tusks for fighting and antlers for defence.[8] Capreolinae
followed soon after; Alceini appeared 6.4–8.4 Mya.[60] Around this period, the Tethys
Ocean disappeared to give way to vast stretches of grassland; these provided the deer
with abundant protein-rich vegetation that led to the development of ornamental antlers
and allowed populations to flourish and colonise areas.[8][50] As antlers had become
pronounced, the canines were no more retained or were poorly represented (as in elk),
probably because diet was no more browse-dominated and antlers were better display
organs. In muntjac and tufted deer, the antlers as well as the canines are small. The
tragulids, however, possess long canines to this day.[47]
Pliocene epoch



Cervocerus novorossiae
With the onset of the Pliocene, the global climate became cooler. A fall in the sea-level led
to massive glaciation; consequently, grasslands abounded in nutritious forage. Thus a new
spurt in deer populations ensued.[8][50] The oldest member of Cervini, † Cervocerus
novorossiae, appeared around the transition from Miocene to Pliocene (4.2–6 Mya) in
Eurasia;[61] cervine fossils from early Pliocene to as late as the Pleistocene have been
excavated in China[62] and the Himalayas.[63] While Cervus and Dama appeared nearly 3
Mya, Axis emerged during the late Pliocene–Pleistocene. The tribes Capreolini and
Rangiferini appeared around 4–7 Mya.[60]
Around 5 Mya, the rangiferines † Bretzia and † Eocoileus were the first cervids to reach
North America.[60] This implies the Bering Strait could be crossed during the late Miocene
Pliocene; this appears highly probable as the camelids migrated into Asia from North
America around the same time.[64] Deer invaded South America in the late Pliocene (2.5–3
Mya) as part of the Great American Interchange, thanks to the recently formed Isthmus of
Panama, and emerged successful due to the small number of competing ruminants in the
continent.[65]
Pleistocene epoch
Large deer with impressive antlers evolved during the early Pleistocene, probably as a
result of abundant resources to drive evolution.[8] The early Pleistocene cervid †
Eucladoceros was comparable in size to the modern elk.[66] † Megaloceros (Pliocene
Pleistocene) featured the Irish elk (M. giganteus), one of the largest known cervids. The
Irish elk reached 2 metres (6.6 ft) at the shoulder and had heavy antlers that spanned 3.6
metres (12 ft) from tip to tip.[67] These large animals are thought to have faced extinction
due to conflict between sexual selection for large antlers and body and natural selection
for a smaller form.[68] Meanwhile, the moose and reindeer radiated into North America
from Siberia.[69]
Taxonomy and classification



Cervid skull
Deer constitute the artiodactyl family Cervidae. This family was first described by German
zoologist Georg August Goldfuss in Handbuch der Zoologie (1820). Three subfamilies are
recognised: Capreolinae (first described by the English zoologist Joshua Brookes in 1828),
Cervinae (described by Goldfuss) and Hydropotinae (first described by French zoologist
Édouard Louis Trouessart in 1898).[2][70]
Other attempts at the classification of deer have been based on morphological and genetic
differences.[45] The Anglo-Irish naturalist Victor Brooke suggested in 1878 that deer could
be bifurcated into two classes on the according to the features of the second and fifth
metacarpal bones of their forelimbs: Plesiometacarpalia (most Old World deer) and
Telemetacarpalia (most New World deer). He treated the musk deer as a cervid, placing it
under Telemetacarpalia. While the telemetacarpal deer showed only those elements
located far from the joint, the plesiometacarpal deer retained the elements closer to the
joint as well.[71] Differentiation on the basis of diploid number of chromosomes in the late
20th century has been flawed by several inconsistencies.[45]
In 1987, the zoologists Colin Groves and Peter Grubb identified three subfamilies: Cervinae,
Hydropotinae and Odocoileinae; they noted that the hydropotines lack antlers, and the
other two subfamilies differ in their skeletal morphology.[72] However, they reverted from
this classification in 2000.[73]
External relationships
Until the beginning of the 21st century it was understood that the family Moschidae (musk
deer) is sister to Cervidae. However, a 2003 phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of
National Museum of Natural History, France) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and



nuclear analyses, revealed that Moschidae and Bovidae form a clade sister to Cervidae.
According to the study, Cervidae diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade 27 to 28
million years ago.[74] A similar study in 2013 echoed the findings of this study.[75] The
following cladogram is based on the 2003 study.[74]
Ruminantia Tragulina Tragulidae
Pecora
Antilocapridae
Giraffidae
Cervidae
Bovidae
Moschidae
Internal relationships
A 2006 phylogenetic study of the internal relationships in Cervidae by Clément Gilbert and
colleagues divided the family into two major clades: Capreolinae (telemetacarpal or New
World deer) and Cervinae (plesiometacarpal or Old World deer). Studies in the late 20th
century suggested a similar bifurcation in the family. This as well as previous studies
support monophyly in Cervinae, while Capreolinae appears paraphyletic. The 2006 study
identified two lineages in Cervinae, Cervini (comprising the genera Axis, Cervus, Dama and
Rucervus) and Muntiacini (Muntiacus and Elaphodus). Capreolinae featured three lineages,
Alceini (Alces species), Capreolini (Capreolus and the subfamily Hydropotinae) and
Rangiferini (Blastocerus, Hippocamelus, Mazama, Odocoileus, Pudu and Rangifer species).
The following cladogram is based on the 2006 study.[60]

Upper Palaeolithic cave painting of a Megaloceros giant deer at Lascaux, 17,300 years old
In prehistory
Deer were an important source of food for early hominids. In China, Homo erectus fed
upon the sika deer, while the red deer was hunted in Germany. In the Upper Palaeolithic,
the reindeer was the staple food for Cro-Magnon people,[93] while the cave paintings at
Lascaux in southwestern France include some 90 images of stags.[94]
In history
Ancient Greek gilt-silver rhyton, 4th century BC
Deer had a central role in the ancient art, culture and mythology of the Hittites, the ancient
Egyptians, the Celts, the ancient Greeks, the Asians and several others. For instance, the
Human interaction



Stag Hunt Mosaic of ancient Pella, under the Kingdom of Macedonia (4th century BC),
possibly depicts Alexander the Great hunting a deer with Hephaistion.[95] In Japanese
Shintoism, the sika deer is believed to be a messenger to the gods. In China, deer are
associated with great medicinal significance; deer penis is thought by some in China to
have aphrodisiac properties.[96] Spotted deer are believed in China to accompany the god
of longevity. Deer was the principal sacrificial animal for the Huichal Indians of Mexico. In
medieval Europe, deer appeared in hunting scenes and coats-of-arms. Deer are depicted
in many materials by various pre-Hispanic civilizations in the Andes.[93][97]
The common male first name Oscar is taken from the Irish Language, where it is derived
from two elements: the first, os, means "deer"; the second element, cara, means "friend".
The name is borne by a famous hero of Irish mythology—Oscar, grandson of Fionn Mac
Cumhail. The name was popularised in the 18th century by James Macpherson, creator of
'Ossianic poetry'.
In literature
Deer have been an integral part of fables and other literary works since the inception of
writing. Stags were used as symbols in the latter Sumerian writings. For instance, the boat
of Sumerian god Enki is named the Stag of Azbu. There are several mentions of the animal
in the Rigveda as well as the Bible. In the Indian epic Ramayana, Sita is lured by a golden
deer which Rama tries to catch. In the absence of both Rama and Lakshman, Ravana
kidnaps Sita. Many of the allegorical Aesop's fables, such as "The Stag at the Pool", "The
One-Eyed Doe" and "The Stag and a Lion", personify deer to give moral lessons. For
instance, "The Sick Stag" gives the message that uncaring friends can do more harm than
good.[93] The Yaqui deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a
pascola [from the Spanish 'pascua', Easter] dancer (also known as a deer dancer).
Pascolas would perform at religious and social functions many times of the year, especially
during Lent and Easter.[93][98]
In one of Rudolf Erich Raspe's 1785 stories of Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his
Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia, the baron encounters a stag while eating
cherries and, without ammunition, fires the cherry-pits at the stag with his musket, but it
escapes. The next year, the baron encounters a stag with a cherry tree growing from its
head; presumably this is the animal he had shot at the previous year. In Christmas lore
(such as in the narrative poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas"), reindeer are often depicted
pulling the sleigh of Santa Claus.[99] Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's Pulitzer Prize-winning
1938 novel The Yearling was about a boy's relationship with a baby deer. The fiction book



Fire Bringer is about a young fawn who goes on a quest to save the Herla, the deer
kind.[100] In the 1942 Walt Disney Pictures film, Bambi is a white-tailed deer, while in Felix
Salten's original 1923 book Bambi, a Life in the Woods, he is a roe deer. In C. S. Lewis's
1950 fantasy novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe the adult Pevensies, now kings
and queens of Narnia, chase the White Stag on a hunt, as the Stag is said to grant its
captor a wish. The hunt is key in returning the Pevensies to their home in England. In the
1979 book The Animals of Farthing Wood, The Great White Stag is the leader of all the
animals.
Heraldry
Arms of Raon-aux-Bois, France
Deer are represented in heraldry by the stag or hart, or less often, by the hind, and the
brocket (a young stag up to two years), respectively. Stag's heads and antlers also appear
as charges. The old name for deer was simply cerf, and it is chiefly the head that appears
on the ancient arms. Examples of deer in coats of arms can be found in the arms of
Hertfordshire, England, and its county town of Hertford; both are examples of canting
arms. A deer appears on the arms of the Israeli Postal Authority (see Hebrew language
Wikipedia page).[101] Coats of arms featuring deer include those of Dotternhausen,
Thierachern, Friolzheim, Bauen, Albstadt, and Dassel in Germany; of the Earls Bathurst in
England; of Balakhna, Russia; of Åland, Finland; of Gjemnes, Hitra, Hjartdal, Rendalen and
Voss in Norway; of Jelenia Góra, Poland; of Umeå, Sweden; of Cervera, Catalonia; of
Northern Ireland; and of Chile.
Economic significance
Deer have long had economic significance to humans. Deer meat, known as venison, is
highly nutritious and beneficial for human consumption. Due to the inherently wild nature
and diet of deer, venison is most often obtained through deer hunting. In the United



States, it is produced in small amounts compared to beef but still represents a significant
trade. By 2012, some 25,000 tons of red deer were raised on farms in North America. The
major deer-producing countries are New Zealand, the market leader, with Ireland, Great
Britain and Germany. The trade earns over $100 million annually for these countries.[102]
The skins make a peculiarly strong, soft leather, known as buckskin. There is nothing
special about skins with the fur on since the hair is brittle and soon falls off. The hoofs and
horns are used for ornamental purposes, especially the antlers of the roe deer, which are
utilized for making umbrella handles, and for similar purposes; elk horn is often employed
in making knife handles. In China, a medicine is made from stag horn, and the antlers of
certain species are eaten when "in the velvet".[103] Among the Inuit, the traditional ulu
women's knife was made with an antler, horn, or ivory handle.[104]

Deer have long been bred in captivity as ornaments for parks, but only in the case of
reindeer has thorough domestication succeeded.[103] The Sami of Scandinavia and the
Kola Peninsula of Russia and other nomadic peoples of northern Asia use reindeer for food,
clothing, and transport. Deer bred for hunting are selected based on the size of the
antlers.[105] In North America, the reindeer, known there as caribou, is not domesticated or
herded, but it is important as a quarry animal to the Caribou Inuit.[106]
Automobile collisions with deer can impose a significant cost on the economy. In the U.S.,
about 1.5 million deer-vehicle collisions occur each year, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Those accidents cause about 150 human deaths
and $1.1 billion in property damage annually.[107] In Scotland, several roads including the
A82, the A87 and the A835 have had significant enough problems with deer vehicle
collisions (DVCs) that sets of vehicle activated automatic warning signs have been installed
along these roads.[108]



In some areas of the UK, deer (especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour),
have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of bovine tuberculosis,[38][39]
a disease which in the UK in 2005 cost £90 million in attempts to eradicate.[40] In New
Zealand, deer are thought to be important as vectors picking up M. bovis in areas where
brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula are infected, and transferring it to previously
uninfected possums when their carcasses are scavenged elsewhere.[41] The white-tailed
deer Odocoileus virginianus has been confirmed as the sole maintenance host in the
Michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis which remains a significant barrier to the US
nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock. In 2008, 733,998 licensed deer hunters
killed approximately 489,922 white-tailed deer to procure venison, control the deer
population, and minimize the spread of disease. These hunters purchased more than
1.5 million deer harvest tags. The economic value of deer hunting to Michigan's economy is
substantial. For example, in 2006, hunters spent US$507 million hunting white-tailed deer
in Michigan.[42]
Deer hunting is a popular activity in the U.S. that provides the hunter's family with high
quality meat and generates revenue for states and the federal government from the sales
of licenses, permits and tags. The 2006 survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
estimates that license sales generate approximately $700 million annually. This revenue
generally goes to support conservation efforts in the states where the licenses are
purchased. Overall, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that big game hunting for
deer and elk generates approximately $11.8 billion annually in hunting-related travel,
equipment and related expenditures.[109]
The word deer was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. Old
English dēor and Middle English der meant a wild animal of any kind. Cognates of Old
English dēor in other dead Germanic languages have the general sense of animal, such as
Old High German tior, Old Norse djur or dȳr, Gothic dius, Old Saxon dier, and Old Frisian
diar.[110] This general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the
Middle English period, around 1500. However, all modern Germanic languages save English
and Scots retain the more general sense: for example, German Tier and Norwegian dyr
mean animal.[111]
Etymology
Terminology



"The Stag Hunt of Frederick III, Elector of Saxony" by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1529
For many types of deer in modern English usage, the male is a buck and the female a doe,
but the terms vary with dialect, and according to the size of the species. The male red
deer is a stag, while for other large species the male is a bull, the female a cow, as in
cattle. In older usage, the male of any species is a hart, especially if over five years old,
and the female is a hind, especially if three or more years old.[112] The young of small
species is a fawn and of large species a calf; a very small young may be a kid. A castrated
male is a havier.[113] A group of any species is a herd. The adjective of relation is cervine;
like the family name Cervidae, this is from Latin: cervus, meaning stag or deer.
