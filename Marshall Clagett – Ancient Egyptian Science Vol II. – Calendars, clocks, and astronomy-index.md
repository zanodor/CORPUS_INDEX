PREFACE
Preface
This volume is the second of the three volumes on Ancient Egyptian Science which I hope to complete. I have not included everything which I projected for Volume Two in the Preface to Volume One. The chapter and documents regarding mathematics are missing. It would have greatly increased the length of the volume to have included them here and accordingly I decided to shift them 10 Volume Three. That shih maKes no difference in the progression of subjects originally planned for the whole worlc. for I believe that the lack of theoretical discussions of mathematics by the ancient Egyptians in their rudimentary science made it imperative first to outline the principal uses of mathematics by the dwellers on the Nile before discussing its structure and content. One possible benefit of including mathematics in Volume Three is
that it can be more closely related to my discussion of Egyptian techniques of representing nature and within that topic to appraisals of the ancient Egyptian lad: of a direct angular or arcal measure to quantify stellar displacements and thus produce more accurate celestial diagrams. of the absence of an effective method of geometric projection. and finally of their lack of any extended use of perspective (which. however. surely did not hamper their considerable artistic skilD. The organization of the current volume is self-evident. Again I have given a lengthy introductory chapter which attempts to synthesize the three main subjects included in the volume: calendars, clocks. and
astronomical monuments. It summarizes the principal

conclusions which we can draw from the eighteen
documents and the Postscript that constitute the hulk of the volume. The order of those documents follo ....s that of the three subjects mentioned. There is, however, no hard and fast isolation of the topics one from another. Because of this there is much skipping around from date: to date: in the corpus of documents. bul within each area of treatment there is fair chronology evident as befits a historical work covering three millennia of activity. In the case of every individual document the effort
is made to supply a meaningful date or dates. It is true that sometimes the carrier of the document, say a temple ceiling. has a date of construction or execution that is orten much latcr than the document itself, as, for example, is the case of Document 1I1.12 where the decanaJ transit tables (marked in my document by the letter ·U") found in the ceiling of the Cenotaph of $eti 1 (ca. 1306-L290 B.CJ date from at least as early as the reign of $esostris III in the 12th dynasty (ca. 19th
century B.CJ. Similarly, the earliest copies of the Ramcsside Star Clock (Document 111.14) are found in the Tomb of Ramcsses VI (ca. 1151-43 B.C. in the 20th dynasty), but the carC£ully reasoned date implied by the document itself is some time between about 1500 and
1470 n.c. in the 18th dynasty. I have given more than 150 pages of illustrations. For the most part they include the hieroglyphic (or rarely, hieratic or demotic) texts, some from a single
legible copy, others from an edited text based on several copies. These illustrations will allow the reader who controls the Egyptian language to have ready access to the texts that lie behind my translation. But, as in the first volume, it is my hope that the

translations themselves will give readers without detailed knowledge of the original language. i.e., most
students of the history of science, a good sense of what the documents intend. In regard to the illustrations. I
should notc that occasionally 8 magnifying glass may be
needed by the reader studying them. But even in the cases where considerable text appears on a single iIIustntion, the reproductions are remarkably clear as a result of the careful photocopies prepared by my secretllry. Ann Tobias. who often improved the contrast and clarity of the originals from which the illustrations were made. I have given very full notes 10 illustrate the historical steps taken by earlier scholars to advance our knowledge of the subjects trealed in this and the succeeding volume or my work, This was done not only to give the reader a good sense or the development or scholarship over the last two centuries, but also to give honor and credit where they are due. Since the appearance or Volume One, two towering Hgures in the study or Ancient Egyptian Astronomy have died: Otto Neugebauer, whose help and rriendship I have acknowledged in the PreFace to Volume One, and Richard Parker, a premier student or the Egyptian calendars and Neugebauer's coauthor or the penetrating and inrormative Egyptian Astronomical Texts in three volumes. Their respective talents complemented each other exceedingly well: Neugebauer's superb analytical powers and Parker's philological skill and extensive knowledge or the texts. The reader will be well aware or my debt to them. Among earlier authors, Renour. Lepsius, Brugsch, Meyer, Sethe, and Borchardt stand out, but the reader will also Hnd mentioned the works or many other later scholars (e.g.. Hornung and Barta)

and younger ones (e.g.• Krauss) who have darined and solved many of the puzzling problems concerning the topks of this volume. Unfortunately. it was only after J completed this volume that I obtained a copy of Christian Leitz's Studien zur Igyptischen Astronomie (Wiesbaden. 1989), and so I was unable in this volume to give it the careful study which it deserves (but see Chapler Three. notc 49), I must also notc with
gratitude that James nay·) O. Mills of the Nekhen Excavations team has allowed me to publish as II Postscript most of his unpublished paper on a petroglyph with possible astronomical significance. This petroglyph was discovered by Mr. Mills and Ahmed Irawy Radwan during II survey operation in 1986. As in the case of Volume One. special thanks are tendered to Dr. Robert Bianchi for his helpful reading of this volume in its first version. Closer to home. I must again thank my wife. Sue. to whom the whole work is dedicated. for her expert editorial help and. above all. for her constant encouragement. I have already thanked my secretary. Ann Tobias. for the magic she has worked with the illustrations. But she also undertook the formidable task of reading and rereading the manuscript numerous times. much to its improvement. I also repeat here my thanks to my home institution. The Institute for Advanced Study. for all of its intellectual and material assistance: and especially am I in debt to the library starr. who uncovered copies of even the rarest articles and books. And finally I want to express my appreciation to the American Philosophical Society for continuing to publish this large work. In that organization thanks must especially go to Herman
Goldstine. its Executive Director. to Carole Le Faivre.

CALENDARS. CLOCKS. ASTRONOMY
Chapter Three
Calendars. Clocks. and Astronomy
Introduction to Egyptian Calendars As we have seen in Volume One. Chapter Two, the Egyptians were wont to call the creator god. whoever he was. Lord of the Years or Lord of Eternity and Everlastingness. Though these titles primarily designated the creator god's creation of time as an aspect of or limit to world order or maat, they may also
have oblique reference to the supposed role played by the creator god (or at least by the king with whom he was identified) in the establishment of a systematic
calendar. However it originated. the civil calendar of 365 days was securely in place by the time of the Old Kingdom. An investigation of the origins of this calendar and its relationship to one or more lunar calendars is fraught with uncertainty and difficulty, but such an investigation will be most useful for anyone attempting to understand the steps taken in Pharaonic times to organize society and express its religious culture in a satisfying, efficient and productive way. Hence we must pursue this investigation as far as the scanty evidence permits.
In the last generation or so, the most inrJuential work on the subject of Egyptian calendars has been that of Richard Parker.' Though Parkers views have wide acceptance, they are anything but certain, as we shall see presently. Parker believes, as did L Borchardt
+



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
in II tentative way earlier. that the Egyptians used the civil calendar of 365 days and two diHerent lunar calendars, He describes the first lunar calendar and the civil calendar in II succinct manner:2 Like all ancient peoples, the protodynastic Egyptians used a lunar calendar, but unlike their neighbors they began their lunaT month. not with the first appearance of the new crescent in the wcst at sunset but rather with the morning when the old crescent of the waning moon could no longer be seen just before sunrise in the east. Their lunar yeaT divided naturally. following their seasons, into
some four months of inundation. when the Nile overflowed and covered the valley. some 4 months of planting and growth. and some 4 months of harvest lind low water. At 2- or 3-year intervals. beclluse 12 lunar months are on the average II days short of the natural year, a 13th or intercalary month was introduced so as to keep the seasons in place. Eventually the heliacal rising of the star Sirius. its first appearance just before sunrise in the eastern horizon after a period of invisibility, was used to regulate the intercalary month. Sirius. to the Egyptians the goddess Sopdet or Sothis. rose he1iacally just at the time when the Nile itself normally began to rise, and the reappearance of the goddess heralded the inundation for the Egyptians. The 12th lunar month. that is the 4th month of the 3rd season. was named [Wp-rnpt] from the rising of Sothis and a simple rule was adopted to keep this event



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
within its month. Whenever it fell in the last II days of its month an intercalary month [Thothl was added to the year. lest in the following year Sothis rise out of its month.... This IURi'stellar yeaT was used for centuries in early Egypt and indeed lasted until the end of Pagan Egypt as 8 liturgical year determining seasonal festivals. Early in
the third millennium o.c. however. probably
for administrative and fiscal purposes, a new calendar year was invented. Either by averaging a succession of lunar years or by counting the days from onc heliacal rising of Sothis to the next, it was determined that the year should have 365 days. and these were divided into three seasons of four 30-day months each. with 5 additional 'days upon the year' or 'epagomenal days', This secular year which is conventionlllly termed the 'civil' year remained in use without alteration to the time
of Augustus when a 6th epagomenal day every 4 years was introduced. That the natural year was longer than the civil year by II quarter or a day was of course known to the Egyptillns rllirly soon after the civil year was inaugurated but nothing was ever done about it, Still it is a great achievement of theirs to have invented a calendar year divorced from lunar movement and to have been the [irst to discover the length of the natural year, which eventually led to the
Julian and Gregorian calendars.... The first year in Egypt, the lunar one, had divided the month into 4 'wee\cs' based on
-3



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
'first quarter', lull moon', and 'third quarter, The new [civil] month of 30 days was not divisible into 4 even parts but conveniently divided into 3 'weeks' of 10 days each. from later texts called ·first'. 'middle' and 'Ias(, Thus in the entire year there were 36 weeks or decades, plus the 5 days upon the year. Parker here maintains that the first of the Egyptian lunar calendars came into existence prior to the invention of the civil calendar. But he also suggests that a second lunar calendar developed as the result of the invention of the civil calendar to keep in step with it, In this second lunar calendar a thirteenth month was intercalated when the New Year's Day of that lunar year would have fallen earlier than the New Year's Day of the civil year without such intercalation. Before considering Parker's views on the structure of the two lunar calendars, let us briefly review the Egyptian civil calendar. The details of this calendar are firmly known and not in dispute, except for the time and manner of its invention, which will be discussed later in the chapter, As noted in the quotation from Parker above, the civil year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each plus 5 epagomenal days, totaling 365 days. The months were grouped in three seasons of four months each, perhaps taken over from the seasons of an earlier
lunar year as Parker suggests.3 but more likely drawn from an early SVUセ、。ケ calendar that was seasonally oriented, such as one based on the rising of the Nile.
The first season was named Akhet <U11 !O,
transliterated as 'bt. and usually translated "inundation"
since originally, when the year coincided with the seasons. this season and indeed the year began with the

sudden rising of the river and for much of that season
the land lay under water), the second was Peret (Si>JQ. prl, meaning 'emergence: no doubt for the emerging
land and plant life), and the third was Shemu (l::JssO, $mtV, meaning 'Iow water' and the time of "harvest"l Arter indicating the regnal year (see Vol. I. Document
Ln. dates usually specified the day. month. lind season in the form of month-number. season. and day-number. For example. "IV キュセ 20' signified the fourth month of the season of Shemu, day 20. Note that each month was divided into three 'weeks" of tcn days each (j.e., decades), both the month of 30 days and the 360 days of the twelve months of the year being neally divisible by that number 10. ThaI IO-day week dictated the use of 36 decans (stars or groups of stars) in the star clocks which we shall discuss later. Month names instcad of numbers were somctimcs
used in the New Kingdom and later.4 The late forms of these names, based on their Greek spelling, arel First
Seasorr. I. Thoth, 2. Phaophi, 3. Athyr, 4. Choiak; Second SellSOrr. 5. Tybi, 6. Mechir, 7, Phamenoth, 8. Pharmuthi; Third $ellSOrr. 9. Pachons, 10. Payni. 11. Epiphi, and 12. Mesore. Now the heliacal rising of Sirius became, at an unlcnown time, the event marking the beginning of the civil year, and because the ycar between successive risings of Sirius was about 365 1/4 days in Pharaonic times,S it is evidcnt that thc civil year of 365 days was
about 1/4 day short of the Sothic year each year, so that the former's New Year's Day was about one day earlier after 4 years (hence 1460 Sothic years • 1461
civil years). Or, to put it in another way. the stellar event of the heliacal rising of Sirius occurred in thc
-5



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
civil year about one day later aher being on the same day for four years and thus in the course of about 1461 civil years it fell successively aher every four years on each day of the civil year until finally once again the rising of Sirius took place on New Year's day of the civil year. This long-term procession is called a Sothic cycle. Now if a sixth epagomenal day were to be added to the civil year at the end of every fourth year in order to halt this march almost entirely, the civil year so modified would then be known as a Sothic fixed year, and the disparity of Sothic and civil years would
almost disappear (again see footnote 5). Despite the belief of some earlier Egyptologists that the so-called Ebers Calendar (Doc. 11I.2) is evidence of such a fixed Sothic year, there is no sure evidence that the Egyptians widely or regularly used a separate calendar of the fixed year to which a sixth epagomenal day was formally added every fourth year, lit least not before the time of Augustus. (We may except from this statement the abortive fixed-year calendar of Ptolemy III promulgated by means of the Decree of Canopus in 238 B.C.. see Doc. 11I.10,) Still the Egyptians obviously knew that the New Year's Day of the civil year, initially set or better reset as I Akhet I by the rising of Sothis. was, quadrennium by quadrennium, steadily receding from the day of the rising of Sothis, appearing almost always one day earlier than that rising after each quadrennium, for at times they recorded (most surely as the result of observation during most of the
Pharaonic period but perhaps occllsionally by calculation by the time of the Ptolemaic period) the rising of Sothis on different days of the diHerent civil years, liS we shall see later when discussing Document 11I.10.6 Furthermore, it could well be that, as was
-6



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
probably the case of the Ebers calendar, other specific calendars or tables correlating a specific Solhic year with some given civil year were used for finding dales in the civil year of seasonal prescriptions or for the construction or use of water clocks where hour scales varied from season to season. These uses we shall discuss Ialer.
Parker's Account of the Old Lunar Calendar Now let us examine the evidence thaI Parker
presents for his view of the old lunar calendar.7 Certainly we may agree that prior to the invention of the civil calendar a lunar month was in use, since the term for "month" (llxJ) employed in the civil calendar was not only written with 8 crescent moon
surmounting a star (X-=-) but appeared in civil dates in

abbreviated form as a crescent moon ( ) with the seasonal number or the month stroked below it (see Fig. 111.2. second register rrom the top where both hieroglyphic rorms or the months or the seasons lire
given. but without the phonetic complement "dO [0:=0] or the rirst rorml Hence the lunar rorm or the term was used even though the 30-day month or the civil year was not tied to the waxing lind waning or the moon, as were the lunar months or 29 and 30 days. The reader should be rirst reminded that ParkerS (and before him Drugsch, Mahler. and Sethe)9 concluded that an Egyptian lunar month began with the rirst day or invisibility or the waning crescent, i.e., in modern terms the day of mean conjunction or the moon lind sun with the earth. This conclusion was arrived at by an anlllysis or the names or the days or the lunar month rirst collected by Drugsch (and I shall comment on this

analysis in Document 111.6 below) and confirmed. Parker believed. by his analysis of a late 2S-year lunar cycle (see Document 111.9). But granting the origin of the term "month" in a lunar calendar docs not tell us anything about the nature of the old lunar year, i.e., whether it was a lunar year of twelve lunar months without intercalation (as for example was the case with the Moslem calendar later) or whether a system of intercalation was in use and if so whether it was the system, suggested first by Borchardt and improved on by Parker, in which intercalation of a thirteenth month was prompted by the heliacal rising of Sirius in the last eleven days of the twelfth month. This system would have produced a normal year of 12 months and an expanded year of 13 every three, or occasionally two.
years. Parker's conclusion that the old lunar year had an intercalary month was drawn, in the first instance, by analogy from the lunar year implicit in the 25-year lunar cycle given in Document 111.9, which was written down in 144 A.D. or later but which Parker calculates was composed in about the middle of the fourth
century B.c. In that 25-year table there were to be 16 "small years" of 12 months and 9 "great years" of 13 months. We shall talk about the details of that document later. Suffice to say now, it surely reveals the existence of an intercalary scheme at this later period of Egyptian history, but of course tells us nothing about the old lunar calendar, since the purpose
of this later lunar cycle was to determine the position of lunar months within the civil year and hence the lunar calendar implicit in this table postdated the invention of the civil year. Parker hoped to strengthen his analogical case for

CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
the earlier use of intercalation by noting references to festivals of the "great year" Bnd the 'small year' in the calendar of Beni Hasan, II document of the Middle
Kingdom (sec Document lII.n that may confirm that at Ihlll time there: was a lunar year of 12 months (the small ycar) and as well 8n intercalary one of 13 months (the great ycar).10 But even this interpretation is not
entirely certain. for the 'small year' referred to may be the lunar year of 354 days and the 'great ycar' the civil
year of 365 days. Hence there is no completely sure way to tell whether the lunar calendar of the Middle Kingdom including these festivals was intercalated in the same way as the later lunar calendar, or what its relationship was to the old lunar calendar. However, even if we assume that the analogical case for some kind of intercalation in the old lunar calendar is sufficiently strong, we still need to look at the evidence for the actual system of intercalation accepted by Parker, namely one depending on the heliacal rising of Sirius. The nrst type of evidence presented by Parker is the oft-expressed relationship between Sothis and the year or the opening of the year

reign of Horus Djet (see Fig. 11I38),12 He and his predecessors believed that on the right of the tablet the recumbent cow represented Sothis and that she has between her horns two vertical signs. the rirst one being an old form of the hieroglyph for 'year' (rnpt>
and the other III simple stroke. If this is correct, then the horns combined with the rnpt glyph suggest the meaning 'opening or opener of the year: rendering the
combined signs W. Furthermore. if it is assumed Ihllt the cow represents Sothis, then the whole figure ought to be translated as ·Sothis. opener of the Year: Below the cow are other signs that, they thought, ought to be
read as the glyphs for '/It, the first season. i.e..
Inundation. And still below them these early scholars thought they saw in the fragmentary copy of the tablet (see Fig. lll.3b) traces of a crescent with at least two
strokes below it. suggesting the meaning 'month 2: However this is doubtful and no such traces can be seen on the main tablet itself. To the left of the cow is first a vertical spear-like bar that may be a separator or it may be a glyph representing the word 'first" (tpy) or
the number "I." Farther to the left are glyphs that relate to King Ojer and a town that was earlier
interpreted by Petrie as Oep IoセH but is more likely
to be read as Ap (--"01 see note 14 below), a town that is not otherwise known.

probably no longer be accepted (even in the revised version), and indeed the earlier version was later abandoned by Parker himself (see notc 12 above), mainly as the result of the reexamination of the purport
of the tablet by Gerard Godron.l4 Godron's principal conclusions may be summarized: the inscription is not a dale al all and has nothing to do with the opening of the ycar: the recumbent cow is Sekhet-Hor instead of Sothisl the uprights between the
horns are not an earlier form of the 'year" sign f plus a simple vertical stroke. but nther. as Petrie llnd Griffith
thought. Il single "feather" sign Psince the 1'0110 vertical
signs aTC in fact connected at the lopI the month signs on the lower right in the fragmentary copy of the tablet cannot be seen on the main tablet and so simply do not exist on it. Lastly, the sign interpreted on the one hand as the glyph for the season of Inundation or on the other for "marshes" could be either, and thus
cannot be surely identiried as the one or the other. But such rderences connecting Sothis with the regulation or the beginning of the year, even including the doubtful reading on the tablet from Djer's reign, do
not necessarily apply 10 the role of Sot his in determining the intercalation of II thirteenth lunar month. since the coincidence of the rising of Sirius and
the inundation that signalled the beginning of the civil year was probably known from lln early date even if that rising was not responsible for the determination and invention of the civil year of 365 days. as used to be thought. Hence all of these passages relating Solhis and the year could simply constitute recognition of that coincidence. One further line of reasoning followed by Parker
-11



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
involves the fact that on occasion the twelfth month (at least some time from the New Kingdom on) had the name Wp rnpt instead of Mesore, which former name
Parker believed to be the name of that month in the old
lunar calendar.6 He reasoned that it was so named in the lunar calendar because this was the month in which the reappearance of Sirius would herald the succeeding month as the first month of the later lunar year if it
happened prior to the last cleven days of the month. or if it occurred in those last eleven days it signalled the intercalation of a thirteenth month in order that during the next year the rising of Sirius would remain in the twelfth month rather than shifting to the first month and thus after the New Year's Day. Hcnce in this argument wp rnpl simply mcant the actual appearance of Sirius and was equivalent to the later expression prt
Spdt, "the going forth of Sothis:16 So. according to Parker, it was only after the establishment of the civil calendar (and in fact perhaps not until the Middle Kingdom) that wp rnpt was used in its literal meaning of the New Yeal's Day of the civil calendar. and when this happened both meanings of wp rnpt were in use, Hc finds support for this double use of wp rnpt by slightly misinterpreting the opening reference to I Akhet I in an incomplctc Ramesside calcndar edited by Dakir. saying that on thai day the sccond fcstival of wp rnpt (wp rnpt sn-nw) was celcbrated.17 The inference that Parker draws from this information is that another <that is, a "first") celebratien of wp rnpt (wp rnpt tpy)
tool: place to celebrate the actual appearance of Sirius in the twelfth month of thc preceding lunar year. Out this evidence of a "second' festival of wp rnpt does not ensure that what Parker calls the first celebration refers to the use of the appearance of Sirius as an intercalary

evidence supporting it than that presented by Parker. Parker had viewed the Ebers Calendar (Doc. 111.2) as being an effort to correlate a schematized old lunar calendar with the civil calendar in the ninth year of Amenhotep I's reign. He believed that the £irst entry
which identified wp rnpt with prt SpOt is evidence that we have a lunar calendar in which the rising of Sothis is an indicator of the lunar New Year's day to (ollow in the next month. On the other hand, Kurt Selhe (see Document 111.2 below) and, following him closely, Raymond Weill,l9 presented the view that the month names must be distinguished from the eponymous (east days from which they took their names, and that the
eponymous feast days were not in their homonymous months but were in fact the culminations of those months and hence took place at the beginnings o( the succeeding months. In this connection Weill (depending on Gardiner. Meyer [see especially Fig. 1II.6a], and Sethe> presents a list. developed hom a number of calendars and calendaric statements dating from a period extending from the Middle Kingdom through the Ptolemaic-Roman epoch, which shows that almost invariably the (east days were celebrated in the months following those to which the feast days gave their names (also see Fig. 1II.6b). This would explain why the Feast of Wp rnpt begins the Ebers Calendar even though the month of Wp rnpt is later the name of the

twelfth month. Hence the Ebers Calendar loses its significance as evidence for Parker's reconstruction of the old lunar calendar since in this year of the Eberl" Calendar the Feast of Wp rnpt is correctly the first
entry of the year occupying the first column. It is not, as Parker believed, an event of the twelfth month placed at the beginning of the calendar to inform us that the next entry (the Feast of TekhD is the beginning of a schematized lunar year. I shall elaborate my view of the Ebers Calendar laler. Now I simply say that I find Selhe's presentation convincing and hence, in discussing Document 111.2.

that the latter two also were lunar.... The proposed original lunar calendar fits the chronological order perfectly, and I know of no other explllnlltion. Wp rnpC was the rising of Sothis, the event which opened the new year but which. in itself, did not form part of it. Tpy rnpt was the first day of the new ycac, the first day of the month (by in

As 1I special month it was fittingly dedicated to Thalh, the moon-god. Now what are we to make of Parker's explanation of how these popular Old Kingdom feast days fit chronologically into and so help to support the specific
intercalary lunar calendar described by Parker? It is certainly true that if the first three feasts were
celebrating separate. distinct events on three distinct days which were items in a chronological order. then Parker has indeed a good case in view of the fact that the remaining annual feasts (Nos, 4-8) are quite probably in chronological order, For if the festival of the rising of Sothis had to fall before the festival of Thoth and that of the first of the year. then one could not simply answer that it was the rising of Sirius that had strayed from its position at the first of the civil year that was being celebrated before the first day of the year because if it were that civil-related rising of Sirius that was being celebrated even after moving away from the civil New Year's Day one would expect

CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
it to follow after the civil New Year's Day, as it inched through the civil year. But what about the festival of Thoth that appears regularly between the rising of Sothis and the New Year's Day? Was not Thoth the name of the First Month of the Year and should it not accordingly have followed the festival of the New Year's Day? No. Parker says, at the time of the old lunar calendar Thoth was the name of the intercalary month of the lunar year rather than that of the first month. Unfortunately Parker has had to assume what he should have been proving. That is to say, he first assumes that the first three feasts are chronological and relate to the old lunar year and then in order to support this he has to assume that Thoth was the name of the
intercalary month rather than of the first month as it was later and for which there is a great deal of evidence. Thus in order to justify the chronological assumption he has to make a further assumption for which there is no other hard evidence, namely thai the festival of Thoth must indeed precede rather than follow the First Day of the year. The kind of reasoning that Parker applied to the first three old feasts may leave the reader uncomfortable. But. in defense of Parker, it must be said that the evidence
presented by Parker for the rest of the list's being chronological is substantial (though based on considering the order of these feasts celebrated in the civil year). and thus he believes that the first three feasts must also be chronologically ordered. Furthermore. since many of the feasts on the list appear to be lunar in origin, the first three festivals must refer to feasts in the old lunar calendar. If that is so, then the position of the festival of Tholh between the festival of the rising of Sothis and New Year's Day
-19



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
necessitates its reinterpretation in a lunar calendar. and the only sound explanation for the order of the three
feasts in 8 lunar calendar would result if it assumed that tbe rising of Sirius signalled the coming New Year's Day at the beginning of the next lunar month and that the festival of Tholh was a festival of the intercalary month. This festival of Thoth (for which there is no other compelling evidence)21 would be 8 quite different fcast from the ordinary feast of Thoth celebrated in the civil calendar on I Akhet 19 (see
Document 11I.5 below),22 The objection implied by
Gardiner that unlike the other festivals that of Thoth in
the lunar calendar would not be an annual festival,23 is
simply set aside by Parker. Convinced that aU of these twelve feasts were chronologically present in the old lunar calendar. he of course rejects Gardiner's quite different suggestion that the names of festivals (I}-(3) might reflect "three separate aspects of the beginning of the (civill year. Wpt rnpt Viewing it as the birthday of
the sun-god Rec (Mesorel. [}pwtlt as under the sway of Yhoth, the initiator of the year of 360 • 5 days. and
Tpl rnpt as the most appropriate dale for the accession of the earthly king:24 Even if the aspects suggested by Gardiner are themselves wrong. the idea that more than one festival representing the beginning of the year, each with a different name, was celebrated on the same day (especially at different places) is certainly reasonable considering the calendars edited by Bakir and
the evidence assembled by Schott.25 On considering further Parker's treatment of the first three festivals mentioned in the old mastabas, I remind the reader of an even more telling refutation of his explanation of the character and order of these festivals. Our examination of the Ebers Calendar shows



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
[below and in Document 111.2] that just the reverse of Parker's assumption appears to be true. namely, (I) the Feast of Wp-rnpt was not merely an indication of the rising of Sirius to hail the next month's beginning of
the year or the necessity of intercalating a thirteenth month (Parker's view), but rather itself marked the beginning of the year, and (2) the Feast of Thoth mentioned as the second festival on the mastabas was not at all a celebration of an intercalary thirteenth month dedicated to Thoth which followed the rising of Sothis (within II days of the end of the twelfth month) but rather was the culmination of the annual celebrations of Thoth beginning before the end of the rirst month and culminating on the first of the second month of the year. The Feast of Thoth thus did indeed follow the Feast of the New Year but not as a festival of intercalation, and certainly not before the beginning of the year, Without detailing the other lines of reasoning that convinced Parker of the correctness of his description of the old lunar calendar but which do not produce certain conviction. I believe we can reasonably conclude that he has given us an account that is only barely possible and is quite speculative in detail and not convincing in its over-all argument, His often used rhetorical expressions like ィ」オウセ、ョ。Mィ」オウ ·cannot be other than: ·can be nothing other than: 'there is no other plausible explanation: ·What can be more natural

calendar and appears to be in accord with a religious statement about the conception and birth of the moon god Khans (see Document 11I.61 I say "not certainly proved" because the three main pieces of evidence on which the conclusion is based. namely the names of the days of the lunar month. the 2S-year lunar cycle of
Papyrus Carlsberg 9. and a series of double dates (the lunar month days in the civil calendar) all date from a period more than a millennium or two later than the date when the old lunar calendar flourished. Indeed though some ten of the protective gods of the feasts of lunar days are found in astronomical ceilings of the 18th and 19th dynasties and the names of eight of the feasts of lunar days appear in the calendar of Medina Habu of Dynasty 20 (and perhaps earlier in the Ramesseum in Dynasty 19)-see Documents 111.3. iliA and 11I.5. in fact it is only in the Greco-Roman period that the full list of 30 lunar day-feasts appears, as is also true of the 2S-year lunar cycle and the double lunar-civil dates. On the other hand, it does seem almost certain that the
Egyptian day began at dawn the hour before sunrise rather than at sunset during ancient Egypt's recorded history,26 and this fits beller with a month whose first day is the first day of invisibility of the waning

crescent before sunrise, We shall return to this question presently when we discuss the later lunar calendar, One final word concerning Parker's reconstruction
of the old lunar calendar. By means of it he has attempted to substitute a luni-stellar seasonal calendar for a fixed Sothic seasonal calendar. That is to say,
Parker has replaced with his description of a schematized 'old lunar calendar the view of early
Egyptologists that in order to keep track of their seasonal and other feasts the priests in the temples used some kind of fixed Sothic calendar whose New Year's Day was the heliacal rising of Sirius and to which a sixth epagomenal day was added every four years. Both reconstructions found the ·heliacal rising of Sirius· as crucial and both employed the evidence of temple calendars (see Document 11I.5), astronomical ceilings, and the Ebers Calendar as useful. Needless to say, to question Parker's construction is not to affirm the Sothic fixed year, at least not in the complete and exaggerated form which held that a sixth epagomenal day was added formally to the year every four years. Now two further subjects remain to complete the discussion of ancient Egyptian calendars. the later lunar calendar and the origin of the civil calendar and its occasional correlations with the rising of Sothis.
The Later Lunar Calendar The essential features of the later lunar calendar are much more firmly established than those of the old, Key to the understanding of this calendar was the discovery and editing of Papyrus Carlsberg 9 by Neugebauer and Volten in 1938 (see Document 11I.9). As Parker has noted, this is "the only truly

144. and it furnishes a simple scheme. based upon the civil calendar, for determining the beginning of certain lunar months over 8 25-ycar cycle. Underlying this cycle arc the [acts that 25 Egyptian civil years have 9.125 days and that 309 lunar months (divided into
16 years of 12 months and 9 years of 13 months) have 9,124.95231 days. The carliest cycle mentioned in the text began in the sixth year of Tiberius. A.D. 19. and the latest in . year 7 of Antoninus. A.D. 144. Actually. the calendar does not indicate when every month began but lists only six dates for every year. those falling in the second and fourth months
of each season. It also indicates the years of 13 months ("great" years) according to the following scheme, 1st, 3d, 6th. 9th, 12th, 14th. 17th, 20th, and 23d year of each cycle. Table 3 [equivalent to my Fig. 111.& taken from Neugebauer and Volten] gives the complete cycle as stated in the papyrus. Anyone using this calendar would begin a lunar month. without regard for actual observation, on II Ibt I (which for A,D. 19 would be September 18; for A.D. 44, September II; for A.D. 69, September 5: and so on up to A.D. 144, August 17), on JIll I!lt 30 (for A.D. 19.

-24



CALENDARS. CLOCKS. ASTRONOMY
significant about the cycle for our purpose is that it gives a continually recurring series of lunar dates, easily and accurately translatable into the JulillR calendar for this period.
The first use that Parker malees of this lunar cycle is to tcst his view (propounded first by Brugsch and followed by Mahler and Selbe) that the lunar month began with the nrst inVisibility of the waning crescent moon in the morning. The original editors of the text of the cycle. aher analyzing the values for the year 144 A.D.. arrived at the conclusion that for this table the lunar month began with new crescent visibility in the evening.28 Though this seems to go against Parker's view, derived originally from an analysis of the names of the days of the lunar month, he agrees that the cycle when applied to the year 144 A.D. does indeed seem to show that the month is starting with the £irst visibility
of the new crescent.29 But he goes on to observe that the cycle produces an error of one day in about 500 years. Hence if it had been in use for about 500 years. the accumulated error would produce values that coincided with the day of £irst crescent visibility rather than with £irst invisibility of the waning crescent. Thus it becomes crucial to kno..... when the cycle was invented and thereaher continued in use. Since the document shows no evidence of contemporary Hellenistic astronomy, it seems a safe bet that its fundamental structure and calculating techniques arc of more ancient Egyptian origin. Analysis of a series of double dates <i.e., lunar dates speci£ied in the civil calendar) pushes bael.:: the use of the cycle into
Ptolemaic times.30 Furthermore, if we apply the table to the lirst two years of the cycle beginning in 856 B.C., we £ind (Parker, ClJlendlJrs, p. 17) that 'the month

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
starts in every case exactly one day berate the morning of invisibility and two or three days before the evening of crescent visibility: Hence it is clear thai the table would be of no use that early and thus had not yet
been invented. But if we apply the table to the first two years of the cycle beginning 500 ycars later in 357 B.C.. (ibid) "ten out of twelve months start on the morning of invisibility. and only one on the evening of
visibility: If one applies the table to the first two years of the seventh cycle in the period between 357

visibility and the other four are in between. It is clear that, the closer in time the cycle approaches A.D. 144. the less frequently will the months start with invisibility and the more frequently with visibility: Thereupon, considering also his examination of the double dates already mentioned. which push the use of the cyclc bad: into Ptolemaic timcs, Parker reasonably
concludes <ibid, p. 23) that the time most appropriate for thc cyclc's inauguration was around 357 8.C.. 'at least in the form in which we have it. with invisibility of the old crescent as its foundation:31 Satisficd with the yield of Document 111.9 to the problem of when the lunar month began. Parker makes other contributions to a description of the lunar calcndar that underlay this table. In the first place. he uscs the techniques apparent in the cycle's determination of the beginnings of the six even lunar months of each year of thc 25-year cycle and specific lunar dates to produce values for the odd months, thus giving us the completed 25-yel'lr cycle (see Fig. 111.9),32 Having already statcd that the document with the

25-yc:ar cycle tells us which years have twelve months and which contain thirteen. Parker then deduces with little trouble the principle of intercalation followed in the lunar calendar underlying the 2S-year cycle: 'Whenever the first day of lunar month Thoth would fall before the first day of civil Thoth. the month is inlc:rcalary:33 A few final observations by Parker may

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
have discovered the rule that regulated intercalation in the 25-year cycle and have seen that it is one which could easily have been operative before the cycle was installed. The essential point to observe is that the lunar calendar was governed by the civil calendar, since whenever the first day of lunar Thoth would fall before the first day of civil Thoth, the month was intercalary. Since the civil calendar moved forward through the natural year. the lunar calendar attached to it must likewise have moved with it. Moreover.

The Origin of the Civil Calendar I have alrelldy outlined the main chancteristics of the remarkable civil calendllr of 365 dllyS (12 schematized months of 30 days each, llrranged according to four months in each of three sellsons. plus 5 epagomenlll days) invented by the ancient Egyptillns, The most difficult problem regarding this calendllr is the time and circumstance of its inauguration, We should first examine the ellrliest historical evidence of its existence. Setting aside the Djer tablet of the first dynasty, which we earlier characterized as probably not containing a reference to Sothis and the opening of the year, we can point to two indications in the early Annills that seem to be plausible evidence that the civil calendar of 365 days was in use at least by the time of
the beginning of Shepsekaf's reign in the fourth dynasty and irrefutable evidence for that of Neferirtare's in the fifth (see Volume One. Document 1.1. note 13), since the year shared between each of these pharaohs and his

CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
predecessor (probably in the first case and certainly in the second) adds up to twelve months and five days. Another probable reference to the civil calendar occurs in the Ann/lIs for the reign of Neferirkare where it is noted that in the first year of his reign ceremonies took place for the "Birth of the Gods: which in all likelihood were ceremonies devoted to the gods of the epagomenal days (ibid, n. 112). The full civil year, perhaps headed
by the epagomenal days (6 セヲ 0) and including the
three seasons with their months, may be found in an
annual schedule of priests performing services for Hathor in the fifth-dynasty tomb of Nekankh at Tehne (see Document 111.1. line 11 of the extract from that
tomb; and see the contrary opinion of E. Winter in note 2 to the Introduction to Document 11I.1). There is as well a reference to the epagomenal days in the Pyalmid Texts (Sect. 1961b-c, Pepi Irs pyramid at the end of the sixth dynasty), "He sees preparation for the festival of the burning Wt., making) of the braziers, the birth of

Accepting these references as firm evidence that the civil calendar of 365 days was in use in the Old Kingdom, we are brought to the question of when it was first used. The exposition of the details of the
calendar by Eduard Meyer in 1904 37 had wide acceptance for a generation or longer. His fundamental conclusion was that the civil year with its structure of twelve months of 30 days each, ordered into three seasons, plus the five epagomenal days remained essentially unchanged from the time that it was adopted and recognized to have a New Year's Day at the hcliacal rising of Sirius throughout the whole Pharaonic

A second assumption was that the Egyptians concerned with the calendar recognized after some time that the rising of Sirius was delayed one day after every four years in the civil ca\endllr (which is very close to the actual delay during the Pharaonic period) and consequently thcy lcarned how to calculate simply the day whcn the heliacal rising of Sirius would occur in any given civil year, and hence observation of the rising was no longer the basis for determining and disseminating the day of rising in the civil calendar, thllt determination being calculated on the basis of an assumed delay of one day in the rising after every four
years. If these assumptions were correct, and given the fact that a Sothic year calculated on the basis of a one-day delay after every four years of successive risings of Sirius is nearly identical in length with the Julian year of 365 1/4 days. we could detcrmine. from the Egyptian historical records of the risings of Sirius in the civil year. the Julian dates of these recordings so long as we knew which Sothic period the record fell in.

Meyer believed that the period beginning rrom 2781-2778 8.C. was too recent for the establishment of the calendar and so he accepted the earlier period. He thought that he had confirmed this when he deduced from rather inconclusive considerations of the Gregorian dates for recent risings of the Nile that it was in the Sothic period beginning from 4241-4238 that the date of Sirius' appearance best conformed with the date of the
Nile's rising.40 However. with the development and acceptance of the 'short chronology' of Egyptian history which can be coordinated with the short chronology elsewhere in the Near East. the general opinion has switched to the third millennium for the establishment of the civil calendar since, at the beginning of the earlier period. Egyptian society was at an undeveloped level of sophistication and was not a unified state. This was given a significant boost by
two influential articles of Otto Neugebauer.41 In the second of these articles he summarized the main conclusion of the first,42 ...the simplicity of the Egyptian calendar is a sign of its primitivity; it is the remainder of prehistoric crudeness. preserved without change by the Egyptians. who are considered to be the most conservative race known in human history. ....there is no astronomical phenomenon which possibly could impress on the mind of a primitive observer that a lunar month lasts 30 days and a solar year contains 365 days.

an average interval of 365 days. Only artcr two or three centuries could this 'Nile calendar' no longer be considered as correct, and consequently one was rorced to adopt a new criterion ror the £load, which happened to be the reappearance or the star Sothis. He went on to point out that the seasons or the Egyptian year are agricultural and not astronomical. The adoption or a unirorm month or 30 days is not to be laid to astronomical observation but to a deliberate schematization or the real lunar months ror administrative purposes in a highly centralized society. He rurther noted that a schematic calendar or twelve months or 30 days is also round in Babylon, though the practical needs in Babylon, organized in city-states, did not lead to a single centralized civil calendar. Following Neugebauer's rejection of the astronomical origin of the 365-day year in favor of its origin in the seasonal rising of the Nile and adopting the

increasingly short chronology for the establishment of the unified state, we could arrive at the condusion that sometime during the first dynasty a 365-day calendar was adopted. say about 3000 B.C. (sec the chronology in the Appendix to Volume One), and that it was maintained for about 220 years until it was decided to use the heliacal rising of Sothis al the beginning of Inundation as the New Year's Day. A strong point in support of giving a role to the Nile's rising is the fact that from at least the reign of Djcr in the first dynasty. a yearly record of the Nile height was kept (and latcr recorded in the Annals which we have given as
Document I.I in Volume One; see that document, notes
13 and 14>' The first of the year and the rising of the Nile are identified in a later rderence (see note 25,
quotation from a Cairo Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days). To be certain about these conclusions would be foolhardy, since we have piled conjecture upon conjecture, starting with Meyer's assumptions about the Sothic cycles. the initial observations of the heliacal rising of Sirius at a given. unchanged location, and the adoption by Egyptians of the scheme of calculating the risings of Sirius upon the rule that it was delayed one
day after every four ycars.43 Before leaving the problem of the origin of the civil year, I must recount in more detail the views of Parker on its origin.44 views which were alluded to in our long quotation from Parker at the beginning of the chapter. He remarks first that prior to Neugebauer's articles. the students of the Egyptian civil calendar had helieved it to have been astronomically determined in that it was inaugurated with the heliacal rising of Sirius as its New Years Day, and that despite the fact that New Years Day fell progressively in advance of Sirius'

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
rising, no attempt was made to adjust or correct the calendar. He also noted that Sethe believed that the lunar year and the civil year were parallel in their development. As for Neugebauer's views. Parker rinds them unsatisfactory. primarily because Neugebauer had not known the structure of the old lunar calendar based on the rising of Sirius, that is, the old lunar calendar discerned by Parker (and which we have characterized above as wanting in surety). Here then is the explanation of the origin of the civil calendar in
Parker's own wordsl45 During the protodynastic period the only calendar in use was the lunar calendar already described. By this time Egypt had become a well organized kingdom, and the economic disadvantages of a lunar year of now twelve months, now thirteen, all of which began by observation. must have pressed themselves upon the government, In an effort to alleviate the situation and to proVide a simple and easily workable instrument for the measurement of time. they hit upon the idea of a schematic lunar yeM, or as it might be
termed an averaged lunar year, There are two ways by which the length of this schematic lunar year might have been determined as 365 days. On the one hand, since the current calendar was based on Sothis, one might simply have counted, for one or two years, the number of days between successive heliacal risings of the star. On the other hand,
the lunar year might have been averaged. It would have been little trouble to refer to the various records of one kind or another from
-34



CALENDARS. CLOCKS. ASTRONOMY
which data on the number of days in recent calendar years might be derived. To show how this might have happened. Parker gives II hypothetical table of the lengths of 2S
successive lunllr years by which he suggests that by accumulative lIveraging from ycar to ycar it will soon be clear that 365 days is the proper length or that by averaging after each year in which the intercalary
month was added the SlIme rigure will be evident even aher only 11 years. Parker continues, Thus easily, by either method. could the Egyptians of the protodynllstic period have arrived at 365 days as the proper length for II schematic year which could be adopted for administrative lind economic purposes. After the analogy of the ordinary lunar year the schematic year would be divided into twelve months and three seasons. each month having 30 days for simplicity and regularity. The extra five days of the schematic year were regarded as an abbreviated intercalary month and were placed before the year. just as the intercalary month headed the lunar year
whenever it occurred. Now as the new year was after all only a
schematic lunar year. it must have been planned to have it run concurrently with and as far as possible in concord with the old lunar calendar. which was by no means to be abandoned. Just what were the actual circumstances of its introduction we shall

If we cannot be certain of the circumst8nces of the introduction. we can al least set a range in time within which it took place. According to the rule for intercalation in the lunaT calendar, when the first month after wp rnpt began .....ithin eleven days of
that event it was intercalary. Tpy rnpt then might be 8S close to wp rnpt as the twelfth day following or. with 8 full intercalary month beginning on the eleventh day
following. as rar away as rorty-one days. It is almost a certainty that the rirst day or the nrst month or the civil year. as we shall hencdorth term the schematic lunar year. also rell within these limits. As this Hrst day had come to be the date or the rising or Sothis in ca. 2773 B.C.. the civil calendar must have been introduced between ca. 2937 and ca. 2821 B.C.• with the probability that it was in the direction or the rormer rather than the latter
date.46
This is a remarkably consistent account. It has the advantage or dovetailing nicely with what we know about the historical circumstances and chronological limits or early Pharaonic Egypt hom other sources. The only major diHicuhy with it is that it is entirely

dependent on Parker's usc of the beliaeal rising of Sirius to govern the old lunar calendar. and. as I have already remarked. this is anything but certain. One last piece of evidence: may bear on the origin of Egyptian knowledge of the length of the solar year
as 365 days. This is 8 petroglyph. most probably of Predynastic date. which was discovered at Nekhen by Ahmed Irawy Radwan and James O. Mills. It may indicate 8 record of annual solar risings from solstice to solstice (see the Postscript at the cnd of this volume), The length of the solar year would have been much more quickly established in this way than by averaging
the wild swings of Nile-risings. Needless to say. even if the solar year was determined in this manner. we still cannot be sure when the onicial civil calendar with its beginning assigned to the heliacal rising of Sirius was established.
Sothic Dates and the Ebers Calendar We have gone as far as the evidence allows in
considering the origins of the civil calendar. It now behooves us to note briefly the three extant double dates that refer to the heliacal rising of Sirius in the civil calendar (see Document 111.10), In our discussion we no longer stick exclusively to the original assumptions noted above in describing Meyer's chronological procedures. but apply to the formulations and tables of P.V. Neugebauer the various possible
values for the latitude of the observer C.> and the so-called arc of vision Cll>. i,e., the minimum angular distil nee between the sun and Sirius after which Sirius is first visible on the horizon in the dawn,47 The latter is somewhat misnamed. for at the minimum angle the star is not visible and the subsequent visibility in ract

depends on variable conditions of the observation. as we shall see, The first of these Sothic dates (proceeding from earliest to latest), is based on two entries from a temple register from llIahun (see Doc. 111.10 and Figs. 111.928 and III.92b), 'Year 7 [of the reign of Sesostris liB, [Month] III [of Season] Peret, Day 25....You should

We do not know with certainty that the prediction was made as the result of the technique of calculating by means of assuming a ッョ・セ、。ケ delay of rising after every four civil years. or whether it was made as the result of a continuously kept record of observed annual risings on which accurale guesses were made beforehand. In the last case the remarks of Edgerton are pertinent for the
determination of the Julian date to which it corresponds,48 The view that a heliacal rising of Sothis was predicted for the sixteenth day of the eighth month in the seventh year of Sesostris
III seems, therefore, to be historically well

Judging by what is known of the history of Egypt during and before the Twelfth Dynasty, it is almost certain that the underlying observations must have been made somewhere between laritude (4\) 29.20 (eH.ahun) and 30.10 (·Heliopolis). I pointed out five years ago that the modern experimental determination of the IIrCUS visionis (ll) for Sothis in Egypt rests on inadequate data: we must continue to use the resulting figures (p may range at least from 8.60 to 9.40 ) but we must bear in mind that a wider range is not excluded....

next generalion.49 The second Sothic date is that of the ninth year of

observations were made at Aswan, as Krauss proposed.
then the rising in question could be as late 85 1506 (Document 111.10, n. 4), which date rests on the doubtful assumption that the Ebers Calendar correlated a lunaT and 8 civil year. Whichever exact Julian date is appropriate for this second Sothic date. the document on which it appeared. namely the Ebers Calendar (Document 111.2), was the object of much speculation and interpretation. Before the time of Borchardt most Egyptologists believed that
the Ebers Calendar had the purpose of specifying in civil year 9 of Amenhotep I first days of the twelve schematic months (each having 30 days) of 8 fixed
Sothic year (see the Introduction to Document m.2 'below, where the views of the earlier Egyptologists are described), In fact. even before the discovery of the Ebers Calendar. Lepsius and Brugsch seem convinced on the basis of very scanty evidence that the early Egyptians kept a Sothic calendar of 365 1/4 days along side of their civil calendar of 365 days.52 The Ebers Calendar on the verso of the rirst column of the Ebers medical papyrus was discovered (or at least its signiricance was discovered) in 1870 (see Figs. 111.10-12 and the discussion in the Introduction to Document 111.2 below). Arter the rubric specifying the regnal year of Amenhotep I, twelve lines follow. The first column has a series of twelve monthly festivals beginning with that of wp rnpt, the second had the corresponding civil dates (each falling on the "ninth" day of successive months), and the third is occupied on the nrst line by the expression the -Going Forth of Sothis" (-the hetiacsl rising of Sirius) and on each succeeding line by a dot. The usual interpretation of this document before Borchardt was that it gave
-42



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
evidence of the Sothic fixed year regularly coexisting with the civil year, since it began with the festival of
the rising of Sothis and proceeded by monthly festivals successively thirty days apart. One obvious difficulty was that the day of each successive festival fell on the SlIme day of each month of the civil year (the ·9th") without taking ·account of the epagomenal days inserted in the civil year. One would hllve thought that after falling on the 9th day of the fourth month of Shemu, it ought next to have fallen on the 4th day of each of the remaining civil months because of the insertion of the five epagomenal days at the end of IV Shemu. There is no completely satisfactory explanation of this inaccuracy, but Edgerton. following the early views of Lepsius, gives us a possible one,53 But the inaccuracy is one of the given facts in our document, and instead of trying to interpret it out of existence by philologically improbable translations, it is our du'ty to face the fact and to try to account for it. The explanation may well start from the purpose which led the ancient scribe to write out this calendar in a prominent and readily accessible place (the first page) on the back of a medical treatise. The purpose, as Lepsius pointed out, was to give the physician an easy means of knowing at what seasons in
the year certain prescriptions were to be used, No prescription in the entire document is restricted to a shorter period than two months. In calculating the calendrie equivalent of a season of the year which was two months long, an inaccuracy of five days would probably not seem very serious to the

Egyptian medical practitioner. I still do not understand why the scribe was so thoughtless 8S to write "9. 1. WI-Wandering. i.e., Civil

W: etc.l would have been just as easy. and obviously more precise-but I think I have seen more deplorable examples of thoughtlessness in modern works whose reputation for accuracy stands deservedly higher than that of the Papyrus Ebers. Up to the time of Borchardt's Mittel the date for
each civil month was read 8S "9" {psI!'. But Borchardt read the hieratic sign used in these dates liS standing for "New Moon Day' (pSr}nlyw) or sometimes perhaps

Borchardt's reading must certainly be rejected.54 While recognizing the cogency of this rejection. Parker retained Borchardt"s belief that the first column gave

CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
was shifted to the second position, to be followed by a consequential shift of one position of all of the months. His solution to this problem also, he thought, disposed of the problem of the missing epagomenal days. Here is what he says (ClJJendlJrs, p. 42): The event which regulated the original lunar calendar was the rising of Sothis, called wp rnpt. The dale of this event would, then. correctly go at the head of a calendar
governed by il. BUI this event also gave its name to the last month of the year. In the first column of the Ebers calendar. thererore, the last month of the year appears at the head of the months merely because its eponymous feast determined the following year. The correct interpretation of the second line of the calendar seems to me to be that the date III §mw 9 is common both to the going-forth of
Sothis and to the beginning of the lunar month wp rnpt. From this date as a starting-point was projected a schematic lunar calendar of full months of 30 days. The failure of the scribe to reCKon the epagomenal days is accordingly not deserving of blame. as it would be were we concerned with a fixed ycar. The schematic lunar calendar was regarded liS exactly that; it was to be merely a guide to the proper identification of the lunar month which included the 9th day of any civil month in its first few days. First consider Parker's last argument against the omission of the epagomenal days.

is also lacking in conviction, for if we: look at the first 'month" listed. namely wp rnpl, we see that it is not the
month (IV) that is given but rather the 'Teponymous]
festival of wp rnpt ClQI"_): as Parker well Ime.... and as all the early discussants of the Ebers Calendar realized. Indeed. on the basis of the evidence analyzed by Selhe
and Weill (see Document 111.2), it seems to me certain (as it did to them) that not just the first but all of the t ....elve cntries in the first column of the Ebers Calendllf ought be considered as the eponymous feast days rather than the months themselves, If this is so. then the problem of why the months are out of order docs not exist, For as Sethe has already shown. the eponymous feast day ordinarily appears in the month following as the culmination of the preceding month (see Fig,
1lI.6bl.56 Furthermore. the £net m that the Ebers
Calendar (in the third column) identifies the heliacal rising of Sothis with the eponymous feast day of wp rnpt, which indeed was the first day of the civil year when the latter was organized or perhaps reorganized in
the third millennium B.c., and the fact (2) that that feast day could not have been the first day of the old lunar calendar outlined by Parker (which. unlike Parker's suggested schematized lunar calendar presented here, was itself not schematic but had months of variable length). seem to dispose of any view that the calendar which was being correlated with the civil calendar was the old lunar calendar with its intercalation scheme, In £net, all that remains of

Parker's old lunar year in the Ebers Calendar are the names of the cleven monthly fcast days succeeding the Feast of Wp-rnpt and indeed there is nothing to distinguish the Ebers Calendar understood by Parker 8S a schematized lunar calendar from an ideal. ad hoc Solhic calendar. And hence what appears to be the elise is that we have in the nrst column 8 truncated Solhic year beginning with the rising of Sothis and containing II more monthly feast days 30 days apart but Jacking
any epagomenal days. As the result of this discussion we have so far concluded that the year being correlated with civil year
9 of the rcign of Amenholcp I was an ad hoc fixed year embracing twelve monthly feast days 30 days apart, which year began with the day of the feast of the Opening of the year. namely the day on which Sirius rose heJiacally.

Egyptians maintained a fixed Sothic Year of religious feasts along side the civil year (see the Introduction 10 Document 111.5, note 5) is nol convincing. Still, as the Sothic dates being here analyzed reveal, the date in the civil year of the rising of Sothis was recorded on a
number of occasions, and thus was probably kept track of on a regular basis. This was most probably by observation but perhaps also occasionally by

calculation. even though no trace of a formal calendar with a sixth epagomenal day added every fourth year or with any more complicated scheme of correction based on yearly observation clIn be found. In concluding my account of the Ebers calendar. I wish to mention what I think. may be a correlative correct reason why the Ebers calendar was composed. namely to assist in the construction or use of a water clock.. an idea first suggested to me on reading SiegFried Schou's Altigyptischc Festd/lten. but which I have developed in a somewhat different direction. I shall describe bow the Ebers calendar would have been used for this purpose later in the chapter under the rubric 'Outflow Water Clocks: and at that time it should be clellt that the major arguments against accepting the Ebers calendar as a correlation between an ad hoc fixed Sothic year and a given civil year can be answered. Leaving the Ebers calendar. we may complete this treatment of Sothic dates by merely referring to the last such date from Pharaonic Egypt. namely that found in a calendar in Aswan from an unknown year of the reign of Tuthmosis III, III 5mw 28 (ca. 1464 8.C.).56 Further details concerning heliacal risings of Sirius in ancient Egypt and Sothic periods arc presented below in Document 111.10.
The Night Hours So far we have concerned ourselves with [he grand units of time represented in calendars with their years. seasons. and months determined in some fashion by the motions of the moon, the sun. and Sirius. Now it behooves us to consider the day and the night and their division into hours. For the early Egyptians nighttime and daylight were each divided into twelve hours. thus
-48



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
producing hours that varied in length according to the seasons (I shall have more to say about this when I discuss water and shadow clocks and the lengths of days and nights for which such might be useful). But we do not lenow the precise time when the number of divisions became 12. We saw in Volume One, Chapter Two and its documents, that by the time of the New Kingdom a series of works had been composed that described the passage of the sun through twelve divisions of the Duat or Netherworld, each division occupying a single "hour: But long before these worles the Egyptians had divided the night into hours. Two passages in the Pyramid Texts taken from the wall of the pyramid of Wenis, the last king of the fifth
dynasty, confirm this.59 The first (Utterance 251. Sect. 269a) reads: 'Oh you who lire over the hours, who lire
before Re. prepare a way for Wenis: The second rellltes (Utterance 320, sect. 515a) the following: 'Wenis has cleared the night; Wen is has dispatched the hours: The hours mentioned in these passages are no doubt nighuime hours, since the contexts seem to confirm this. In both passages the word for hours (wn'IV() is
determined by three stars, suggesting to us that the most primitive meaning of 'hours' was "nighttime hours:60 Later, daytime hours were sometimes
determi,ned by the sun (0), as in the hour names listed in Fig. 111.42, or determined by a star and complemented by the sun when 'hour of the day" is meant (e.g., see
Fig. 111.38, line n.
It seems certain that the division of night into twelve hours arose from the 12-month year and the 10-day week and thus was a consequence of the installation and acceptance of the civil calendar. There were of course 36 decades (i.e., lO-day ·weeks") in the

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
course of the 12 months embracing 360 days. At some
time during the third millennium o.c. star watchers
divided the night into twelve hours, determined by the heliacal risings of stars or groups of stars called
decans.61 Parker describes the invention and development of the decanaI star-clock system succinctly,62 We do not know exactly when the stars were first used to tell time at night but it was certainly by the 24th century D.C. (evinced by the quotations from the PyrlJmid Texts above] and quite possibly soon after the introduction of the civil calendar....
It was not until roughly 2150 D.C. that we know for certain that these night hours totalled 12, This we learn from diagrams of stars on the inside of coffin lids, which were earlier termed 'diagonal calendars' but which are better called 'star clocks'. Figure I (omy Fig. 11I.13] is a schematic version of such a clock. followed in some degree by all our
examples. It is to be read from right to left, A horizontal upper line T is the dale line, running from the 1st column, (j.e.,l the 1st decade of the 1st month of the lsi season, to the thirty-sixth column, (i.e.,l Ihe last decade of the 4th month of the 3rd season, With decade 26 there begins in the 12th hour a triangle of alternate decans to lell Ihe hours through the epagomenal days.... The mechanism of such a clock was the risings of certain selected stars or groups of stars that conventionally afe termed 'decans', at 12 intervals during the night, and at IO-day

intervals through the year, If we now examine the stllr dock of Idy...[my Fig. 111.14] even though it lists only 18 decades we can see very graphically how the name of a decanal star in Bny hour is always in the next higher space in a succeeding column [i.e.. in the next decade), so that a star in the 12th hour rises over 120 days to the first hour and then drops oul of the clock.... We have already seen in connexion CD with the star Sirius-Solhis thai it eventually disappears because it gets too close 10 the sun, and then afler some days it reappears on the eastern horizon just before sunrise, its he\iacal rising .... Of course, 8 slar which has just risen

calendar lind the pattern of successive morning stars led some genius in Egypt to devise II method of breaking up the night into parts, or 'hours', He observed a sequence of stars each rising heliacally on the first day of a decade or week. from a text in the cenotaph of Seli I at Abydos [see Documenl 111.121.. we learn that stars were chosen which approximated the behavior of Sothis in being invisible for 70 days. The star which had risen heliacally

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
on the 1st day of the first decade. thus marking the end of the night. would 10 days latcr be rising well before the end of night. The interval between its rising and the new star's beliacal rising would be an 'hour', Inevitably this pattern of heliacal risings at IO-day intervals would lead to a total of 12 hours for the night. Parker goes on to observe that all of the decans marking the hours would fall in a band south of and
parallel 10 the ecliptic. This is illustrated by Fig. 111.15. where Orion and Sothis are marked on the band. The hours so marked off by the successive risings of these decans would obviously not be of equal length. for as the length of tbe night increased the length of the hours would increase and as it decreased the hour lengths would decrease. As Parker notes. it is the combination of the lengthening and shortening of the night with the periods of morning and evening twilight and the oscillation of the star clock "that explains why the night was divided into 12 hours though there were always 18 decanal stars from horizon to horizon in the night sky:63 The time from sunset to the appearance of very bright stars (the so-called civil twilight) averaged approximately 1/2 hour, while the time from sunset to that when all the stars were visible (the astronomical twilight) may be over an hour and the decans determined the time of total darkness exclusively. The first hour of the night was of indeterminate length. beginning with total darkness and ending with the appearance of a decanal star in the eastern horizon. That hour became progressively shorter each night or the decade, until it was replaced by the rising of another decan as the determiner or the
-52



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
first hour during the next decade. The end of the t ....elfth hour. at the beginning of a decade, was determined by the heliacal rising of its deean and followed soon therclIftcr by morning twilight. Obviously. as the decade advanced the twelfth hour was followed by a progressively longer period of darkness, which was apparently incorporated into the twelfth hour, its length being considered as lasting until light.
Deeana! Clocks Now we are prepared to examine in somewhat more detail the early diagonal clocks based on the risings of deCORS. Our generalized decaRal clock given in Figure 1JI.l3 is based on the detailed analysis of twelve father incomplete and defective clocks on cornn lids that date from about the time of Dynasty 9 or 10 to that of Dynasty 12. The twelve clocks can be placed into five groups, each of which has been cleverly dated by
Neugebauer and Parker.54 The least corrupt of the texts on the various lids are those of Coffins I and 2 (sec particularly the coffin of Meshet given in Document III.II and also Fig. 11I.16 for Coffin 2), which have 34 decans instead of the full 36 decans. Indeed in Document IIUI we are told in column 40. lines 1H2. that 36 decans ought to be there (Iotal of those who are "'in their places', the gods of the sky, 36").55 The first line of the diagonal clocks, labelled T on the model clock of Fig. 111.13 and reading from right to left, contains the headings for the thirty-six decades or IO-day periods we conventionally call "weeks" of each month (labelled "first: "middle: or "last">. The months are grouped into the three seasons of four months which we have described above when discussing the

I£ ....e look carefully at the clock of Mcshet as depicted in Fig. 111.86. which is described in detail in Document 111.11, and also at another sample decanal clock, that of Idy. shown in Fig. 111.14. we notc that the deean in the twelfth row of the nrst column. whose heliacal rising marks the end of the twelfth hour of the
nights of the first decade and whose hieroglyph is composed of two pairs of facing men Ccrew?'), we see that the decan shifts up to the eleventh row in the
next decade. while a new decan. namely knm. occupies the twelfth row of that decade. In the twelfth decade or column the decan of the two pairs of men has reached the first row of the twelfth decade and thus marl:.s the end of the first hour during that decade. The declln then passes from the eastern sky. Skipping over
to the bottom of the 25th column in our idelll clod
schemlltized in Fig. 111.13, the 36th declln (p/Hvy !Jlat, shown in the bottom of the 23rd decllde in Fig. 111.16) would hllve lIrisen heliacally to marl:. the end of the twelfth hour during the 25th declIde. That decan will ultimllte1y marl:. the end of the first hour during the last
or 36th decade of the normal yellr of 360 days. The twelve decans appearing in the twelfth row successively from the 26th decade onward (j.e.. the 11 decans from the 26th through the 36th decades and the 12th decan originally no doubt in the 37th column but later on in the 40th column) serve to determine the hours of the five epagomenal days. Hence that last column (whether the 37th or 40th) strictly speal:.ing is a pentad (j.e., a period of 5 days) rather than a decade.

These twelve additional decans form a kind of triangle on the diagonal chart as they progressively rise through
the hours from decade 10 decade, and the hypotenuse of that triangle is marked in Fig. 1lI.!3 by II bold step-like broken line. The result is thai the twelve hours of the night during the last II decades of the regular year of 360 days and the pentad of the epagomenal days are marked by some combination of the regular 36 decans and 12 supplementary decans (slarting with 8 sum of II of the former and I of the latter in the 26th decade lind progressing to the sum of I of the former and 11 of the latler in the 36th decade) and rinally in the last column <the pentad of the cpagomenal days) by the twelve supplementary decans alone. Inddenllllly. as J have said, it seems likely that the last column was initially merely the 37th column. But apparently this was expanded into 4 columns, the first three occupied by a list of the regular 36 decans and the 40th by the 12 supplementary decans. The- identification of the various decans is extremely difficult (see Fig. 111.18 for a table of the decans based on the star clods>. Not only are all of the extant star clocks corrupt textually to some degree, but even when we are certain of the decanal names and their translations, their proper astronomical identity is
for the most part unknown.66 Decans numbered 26-29 are related in some fashion to Orion (as are the
epagomenal decans C and m and 30-31 to Sothis (as are decans F and G).67 One interesting detail of the star clocks is the strip (V) of four sky-related figures depicted between columns 18 and 19. As shown on Coffins 2 and 3 (see Figs. 111.14 and 111.16-111.17), they are the goddess Nut. holding up the sky; the Foreleg of an Ox (-the Big Dipper); Orion. looking back toward the

goddess of the star Sirius, hcing Orion and holding a was-scepter in her right hand and an 8ntlrsign in her left. Finally we should note that between ro....s 6 and 7, each coHin lid contains II strip of non-astronomical offering prayers for the deceased. The fact that the diagonal clocks were organized to
tell night hours during the civil year of 36S days instead of the Sotbic year of approximately 365 1/4 days guaranteed that they ....ould quickly lose even the moderate usefulness they might have had ....hen • particular clock was composed. Decans would have to
be shifted in place and some new ones used. Evidence for a revision toward the end of the twelfth dynasty exists, but by that time a new system based on the transiting of the meridian by decans was developed, as
we shall see below, Be that as it may, it must be remembered that the extant diagonal clocks on the coffin lids were funerary in purpose and hence largely symbolic, such a clock being merely one more necessary convenience for the deceased to have at hand for eternity just as he also had at hand the offering prayers to sustain his supposed physical wants during that same eternity, Hence the accuracy of the corrin clocks was probably of little moment.
Transit Occanal Clocks We learn of the new system of using the transiting of the meridian by decans. i.e., their culminations, to mark the nighttime hours from later texts which may be collectively called the Book of Nut or the Cosmology of Scti I and Ramesses IV (see Document 111.121 These texts accompanied a large vignette of the ウォケセァッ、、・ウウ

Examining Document 11I.12 will give us a good picture of the transit clock. They tell us that the decen stars, on the model of Sirius, disappear in the Duat. i.e., the Otherworld. for 70 days. after which time they rise again. The account is of a simplified scheme of 360 days. an old star dying and 8 new star being
born every 10 days. After spending 70 days invisible in the Duat. 8 decan rises and spends 80 days in the eastern beaven before it culminates or tURsilS the meridian, after which it 'works' for 120 days, its worlc being [0 mark a given hour by transiting for tcn days starting with the 12th hour during the first decade and ending with the first hour during the 12th decade. Then. its ·worl:" being over, it spends the remaining 90 days in the western sky before dying once more. The change from rising to transit resulted in changes in the decanal list. as Parker observes when describing and
evaluating the transit clods.58 Since 8 star spends 80 days in the east before working. it is clear that it is transiting when it marks an hour. This change to transiting required a wholesale readjustment of decanal stars. When rising, two decanal stars could mark an hour between them but if they were at opposite sides [i.e.• boundaries] of the decanal belt, thus some distance apart on the horizon. they could, when transiting, either pass the meridian together or so far after one another as to result in an extremely
long hour. or the 36 decans of the star clocks

remain exactly in place in the transit list. The other 13 have each a different place or drop
out and are replaced by new decans. The simplification of the clock on the basis of 360 days
reveals to Parker69 the strongly schematic character of such a star dock and poses the question of its real utility. In actual practice one may speculate that all
an observer would need to do would be to memorize a list of 36 decllnal stars, preferably rising ones as being the easier to observe, watch to see which one was in or near the horizon when darkness fell and then use the risings of the next 12 to mark off the night hours. Whether this was done in fact cannot
be said with certainty. bUI it is true .that while we have lists of decaRs on various astronomical ceilings or other monuments to the end or Egyptian history, we have nothing at all approaching a star clock in rorm aher the time or Merneptah (1223-1211 O.C.), and that that was a purely runerary relic is indicated by the ract that its arrangement or stars dates it 600 years earlier into the TweUth Dynasty. However long the practice or telling time by the observation or deC8ns lasted, the title or "hour-watcher" (Imy wnwt or wnwty) persisted until the Ptolemaic period, but perhaps with the general meaning or astronomer once water clocks, shadow clocks. and sun
dials came into common use.70 This is borne out by an inscription hom a sighting instrument made ror an
observer named Hor, or the sixth century B.c.. which has on its bottom the rollowing statement, "I knew the

The Ramesside Star Clock Before examining waler clocks (in most of the
ancient period used exclusively for telling time at night) and shadow clocks and sundials which allowed for different systems of the measurement of hours in
the day, we can nOle the passing by the middle of the second millennium D.C. of the decanal clocks based on risings or transits for anything but decorative purposes. Still we should briefly examine a new form of star clock usually designated as the Ramesside Star clock
because it appears on the ceilings of a number of royal tombs of the Ramesside period. Two scts of the tables appear in the tomb of Ramesses VI, and one each in
those of Ramesses VII and Rilmesses IX.72 Though all of the sets arc corrupt in some fashion, a prototype clock can be constructed from them (consult Document 111.141 Recall that the ancient decanal clock in its ideal form had 36 columns of 12 hours whose ends were marked by the rising of decans and that in its modified form the hours were marked by successive transiting of the meridian by decans. But the new Rllmesside clocks
had instead 24 tables (two per month) of 13 stars, with the first star marking the beginning of the night. Unlike the earlier transit docks it did not confine itself to the transiting of the meridian but also included the transiting of lines before and after (but presumably

near) the meridian. Each of the 24 tables was accompanied by the rigure of a seated man Cthe target figure) with a grid or chart consisting of nine vertical lines and thirteen (sometimes erroneously only twelve) inner horizontal lines (see Figs. 111.19110 and 1II.19b). The inner seven vertical lines are lines of transit. the fifth (of the nine lines) representing the meridian circle. and the other six inner lines representing lines of transit before lind lifter the meridilln; these lines Ire appllrently It equal increments of distance from the meridilln. The inner horizontal lines represent first the beginning of the night. for which the first star is given. lind then. successively. the ends of the twelve hours of the night. The twelve hours are IIccomplnied by the names of stars. each one mllrking the end of an hour when it crosses one of the vertical lines that Ire related to the target figure positioned within or below the grid. Apparently a wllter clock was used to set the original hour ends. the north-south meridilln having been established. At the end of In hour. as determined (without great accuracy) by the water clock. a marking star was looked for, preferably one at the meridian but if there was no significant star there on the meridian then one transiting one of the other six inner vertical lines that were mentioned above as being before or after the meridian. Preceding the list of stars. each table bore a date in the civil calendar. the first table
having the date "I Akhet [1]: which signified that it was valid for the period from the first through the 15th of that month. the second " Akhet 16, [2nd] half-month: signifying its validity from the 16th day of the month through the 15th day of that second hair of the month (j.e., the 30th day of the month: see Document 111.14,

From (I) these dates as given in the four extant copies and (2) the notation that Sothis culminated at the beginning of the night in Table 12. dated II Pere! 16, and (3) hom our knowledge of the -relevant Sothic cycle. we: can deduce a dale of about 1470 B.C. for the stu clock. i.e., more than three centuries earlier than the Ramesside monuments on which the clocl::
appcars. 7 J After the date in the tables a phrase 'Beginning of the night" is given. followed by the name of a star transiting at that time:, and this refers to the first interior horizontal line. Then the names of the twelve hour stars are listed over the succeeding horizontal lines. The name of each star is followed by a brief
phrase descriptive of its position relative to the seated
figure, i.e., Ihe target figure: ·opposite the heart" (r et'
Ib) if on the centcr line or mcridian, 'on the right eye·
(/Jr Irt wnmy) if on Ihe first line left of Ihe center line, ·on the lert eye' ((lr Irl flby) if on the first line right of thc center line, ·on Ihe right ear· (pr msgr wnmy) if on the second line left of the cenler line, ·on the left ear (pr msgr !'by) if on the second line right of the center

addition marked on the accompanying grid by star marks (see Figs. 1II.l9a, 1IJ.19b, 1II.99b, and 1IJ.99c). Parker presents his view of how these transit
clocks were used:74

.... On a suitable viewing platform. probably a temple roof, two men would sit facing one another on a ョッイエィセウオ line. The northernmost would hold a sighting instrument
like a plumb bob (called by Egyptians a mrbt [see Fig. 1II.20a and Fig. III.20b]) before him and would call out the hour when a star had reached either the meridian or one of the lines before or after 8S sighted against the target figure. The effort for such precision points to the use of the ....aler clock as an independent means of marking when an hour had ended, and emphasizes 8S well the reluctance of the Egyptians to abandon telling time at night by the stars. Indeed. a water clock of the Ptolemaic period [Borchardt's Auslaufuhr 3] has an inscription on its rim that its purpose is to tell the hours of Ihe night only when the decanal stars cannot be seen (Borchardt [Zeitmessungl. 1920. p. 8 [d. also p. 9 for Auslaufuhr lOll
If the lists of stars in the 24 tables are examined (see Document 111.14). it will be evident that only three
of the stars used in the Ramesside cloclr: are the same as or near to those used in the decanal clocks, ·Star of Sothis" (sb' n spdtJ. i.e.• Sirius. "Star of Thousands" (sb' n

identifiable with any specific star. Incidentally, it will be seen from the list of the stars found in the 24 tables that many of them are stars from or related to other well-known Egyptian constellations or stars, such as Ihe "Giant" (16 stars), the ·Bird· (4 stars). "Orion" (2 stars. one known as the "Predecessor of £the Slar of] Orion·). and ·Sothis" (2 slars, one of which is called "The One

Coming After £the Star of] Sothis·). The conclusion of an inquiry into the star list seems to be that for the most part the stars of the Ramesside tables lay roughly parallel to but (except for slight overlapping) outside and south of the decanal belt (see Petrie's effort. here reproduced as Figs. 1II.84a and 1II.84b, to reconstruct the constellations and stars of the Ramesside Clock along with the northern constellations and some of the decanal stars).75 So far we have seen that the decanal and Ramesside clocks differ (I) in all but three of the stars they used, (2) in the periods during which each list of twelve hour stars was effective (36 ten-day periods in the decanal clock and 24 half-month periods in the Ramesside clock), and (3) in the fact that the former (in its transit
version) used only transits of the meridian to mark the hours, while the latter used transits of the meridian and of lines before and after the meridian. Notice further that the decanal star marking successively the twelfth hour, eleventh, tenth, etc. through the first hour in successive ten-day periods in the decllnal clock docs not change, but that in the Ramesside clock the hour stars do not always move regularly up the hour-scale from one half-month period to the next. (4) In addition, the hour lengths themselves (however much they vary from each other), once established, remain essentially fixed in the decanaJ clock but often varied in length in its successor as the result of star substitutions "and shifting
hour boundaries on. before or arter the meridian:76 Incidentally, as in the case of the earlier star clocks, the twelve hours of the night marked in the tables or the Ramesside clock, like those marked in the decanal clocks, were not equinoctial hours but were variable. seasonal bours that divided into twelve the period of

total darkness (without twilight> as that period varied
from half-month to half-month.77 Neugebauer and Parleer are careful to point out the inaccuracies inherent in the procedures of transiting in the Ramesside c1ock,78 When we describe the Ramesside star tables as lists of transits the reader should not
be misled into associating with this term any astronomical accuracy we are accustomed to assume for transit observations. Actually the sources of inaccuracy in the Egyptian procedure are only too apparent. That two persons, sitting opposite each other, cannot
resume exactly the same position night after night is clear. To fix accurately the moment of transit. when even very small motions of the eye of the observer will displace the apparent position of a star, is impossible.
Even if we assume optimistically that the target figure was replaced by a fixed statue the least shift of the observer's location would influence badly the accuracy or timing.
Schack*Schaclcenberg assumed that a frame with vertical strings was used to give precision to such vague terms as 'on the shoulder: 'on the ear: etc. Though we have no evidence to support such an assumption the
results would still be crude, if only rrom the lad or definition of the position of the observer's eye with respect to distance, altitude above the horizontal level and deviation from the exact meridian line. And whatever resuhs might have been obtained in one place could not be repealed wilh any

accuracy by another observer and target somewhere else. To this has to be added the well-known inaccuracy of time measurement
by water docks. which must have been tbe instrument on which the star tables were built. In shortl Just as in the case of the decans the crudeness of the underlying procedures is so great that only under severely restrictive assumptions could numerical conclusions be
abstracted from the given lists. If we add the fact of obvious errors and carelessness in details in the execution of the texts as we have them one would do best to avoid all hypothetical structures designed to identify Egyptian constellations from the analysis of the Ramesside star clocks. A more recent, quite diHerent <and I believe less satisfactory) analysis and evaluation of both the data of the Ramesside star clock and the procedures used in
establishing and using it has been given by E.M.
Bruins.79 As will have been evident to the reader. the account I have given here and more fully in Document 111.14 rests primarily on the pioneering treatment of Peter Le Page Renouf in 1874 and the thoroughgoing editorial and analytical eHorts of Neugebauer and

Outflow Water Clocks In the description above of the Ramesside slar clocks. it was suggested thaI waler clocks may have been the instruments with which Ihe hours of star tables were established or at least they may have been used as substitutions for star clocks. Two general types of water clocks were known and used in Ancient Egypt,
-65



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
Outflow Clocks and Inflow Clocks. with remains of the
former outnumbering those of the latter.SI The earliest and most complete specimen of an outflow clock was
one found in broken pieces at Karnak in 1904 by G. Legrain and restored for the Cairo Museum (see Fig. 1l1.21a).82 About 14 inches high. it dates from the reign of Amenhotep III (ca. 1391-1353 B.C.>, is made of alabaster. and has the form of an inverted truncated cone. Thus it is shaped rather Iilce 8 flo....er pot. The vessel was filled with water which Clowed out gradually from a small aperture or oriHce near tbe bottom of the vessel. The Egyptians used the truncated cone for the form of this and other outflow c1epsydrac to compensate for de<:reasing water head as the water level descended and so to obtain a more even flow. By noticing the dropping water level against a scale of 12 hours (in fact 12 scales, one for each month) on the inside of the vessel the hour was obtained. However, the conical form only approximated the paraboloidal interior surface that would produce steady outflow and thus a better estimate of the time. In fact a vessel with a height of 14" and a conical shape like that of Karnak
would have produced a better approximation to an even flow (j.e., an equal descent of the water level in equal times) if the angle of slope of the vessel had been slightly less (1030 instead of about 11(0).83 We shall discuss the form of the clock in more detail later. let us examine the outside of the vessel in the four views comprising Fig. 1I1.21a. Astronomical and other decorations of colored stone and fayence inlays are set out in three rows or registers (see Fig. 11I22) that comprise the so·called celestial diagram, which we shall examine in more detail when we examine Egyptian astronomy later. The first two rows are interrupted by

a vignette of King Amenhotcp III making an offering to
Reharakhti with Thoth behind the Icing. The uppermost row (starting on the right) represents the decans. Just past the midpoint we see Isis as Sothis (Sirius) in a baric. Then continuing to the left we see the planets and the so·called triangle decans. The middle row has the more prominent northern constellations in the center plus some deities on both sides. The bottom row includes six frames or fields that display the Icing with the twelve gods of the months, two gods per field. Between the first (just left of center) and the sixth (to the right) was located the outflow aperture. Examination of later specimens of waler clocks and of the astronomical ceiling of the Ramesseum of Ramesses II (Fig. 111.2), which like other such ceilings mimics to a considerable extent the exterior decorations of water clocks, makes it probable that a small statue of Thoth as the cynocephalic baboon and thus 8S the patron of time was once mounted over the aperture (see also Fig.
111.23>.84
Turning to the inside of the Karnak clock (Figs. 1II.24a-b), we see the aforementioned twelve scales of varying total length, each divided by depressions more or less equally spaced that divide the night in the specified month into 12 hours. The month for which each scale was originally intended 8t the time of its construction (or better, at the time of the construction of the water clock from which it was copied) is indicated on the top rim of the clock (and thus with the hieroglyphs inverted) in the conventional form of
months of the civil year: Month I, Season Akhet; Month 2, Season Akhet;...Month 4, Season Shemu. No effort was made to give separate scales for the epagomenal days. Presumably either the scale for the twelfth
-67



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
month or that for the rirst month was used to tell the hour during the epagomenal days. Under each month the hour scale consists, as I have S1Iid. of a linearly distributed series of small circular depressions each
about 1/5" in diameter.BS When the water level is at one of the depressions it indicates the hour at that time of the year to which the scale belongs. While the depressions of each scale are by no means precisely placed, the total lengths of the scales were quite accurately measured, as we shall see later. The longest scale is about 14 ringerbreadths. which is applicable to the· month containing the winter solstice and thus the longest night of the year. The shortest scale is about 12 ringerbreadths and is used for the month containing
the summer solstice and thus the shortest night. Each
fingerbreadth is equal to 18.75mm (j.e., about 3/4"). The 14,12 ratio is not a very good approximation of the length of longest night to shortest night for Egypt. The ratio 14,10 would have been a betler one. I shall have more to say about the 14,12 ratio later. But we should observe now that. since the civil year was about 1/4 day shorter than the rixed seasonal year, such a clock progressively becomes out of synchronism with the solar seasons (j,e., a shih of one month in about 120 years). Hence as time went on the scales were necessarily being applied to months other than those to which they were assigned in the clock. In fact, since the shortest scale of 12 ringerbreadths was applied in the Karnak clock to the civil month II Shemu, i.e.. the tenth month of the civil year. it is evident that when the clock was built in Amenhotep Ill's time it was already out of date. since the assignment of its shortest scale to the tenth month was not valid for the period of Amenhotep III but rather for that of Amenhotep I

morc than one hundred years earlier (see Fig. 1II.37) when a certain official named Amenemhet describes having constructed such III clock and dedicated it to
Amenhotcp I. So it is evident that the maker of the Karnak clock simply copied the monthly assignments of the twelve scales hom an carlier clock, and thus the scales were about one month off. We shall speak more of Amenemhefs "invention" shortly. Incidentally. it would have been easy to keep a clock like that of Karnak approximately up to date merely by shifting the month names on the rim of the clock after about 120 years. There is. however, no evidence that any effort was made to cover over the month names on the rim of the t(arnak clock itself and replace them with new month names.
Sioley sums up the use of the Karnak clock as
follows,86 In use, the vessel was filled to the full-line, not visible in the Karnak example. where it
had probably been painted on. Traces of the
line are to be seen in the other fragments. At
the end of the first "hour" as measured by the clock. the water level would have sunk to the first mark. and so on successively through the various "hours" to the last mark. Except in
the case of one month. the last mark is not
shown as its position is covered by the row of alternate signs [j.e.• glyphs signifying] LHe and Stability which decorate the interior [as a

the bottom. it slowed and dribbled out. Hence true equal hours were not produced. as we shall discuss
further on. As Sioley further notes:87 Although the hours were nearly correct at the middle of the scale. the earlier were too long and the later too short (Fig. 16 [d. my Fig. 1I1.3iJ). The Egyptians did not know this. They had no [sure] means of determining whether their hours were equal or not. To divide a space of time equally is a very difficult problem without [0] regularly moving mechanism or some precise means of observing the movements of the stars. There are two pieces of evidence of written material that deserve examination in our effort to understand the development of water clocks. The first document bearing on water clocks is an inscription from a ruined tomb near the top of the hill of Sheikh cAbd el-Gurna in Western Thebes. This was the tomb of the official mentioned above. Amenemhet. who lived under the reigns of the first three kings of the 18th dynasty:
Ahmose. Amenhotep I, and Tuthmosis I (see Document 11I.15 below and fig. 111.25). In the much worn inscription the deceased tells us (Jines 7-9) that "while reading in all of the books of the divine word" (j.e.. the whole of Egyptian literature) he found lthe (longest) night of wintertime to be] 14 [hours long] when the [shortest] night of the summertime is 12 hours UongT and that the hour lengths from month to month increase and then decrease. This [its in precisely with the Karnak water clock as we have described it: the monthly scales of the lengths of the nighttime hours to be used in a water clock vary from 12 fingerbreadths on the summer solstice to 14 fingerbreadths on the winter

solstice with the intervening monthly lengths first increasing uniformly and then decreasing uniformly (with the fingerbreadth • 114 palm· 1/28 cubit· ca.

have been detailed by Borchardt.BS and reported succinctly by SloJey:89 The fundamental scale (12fl is the shortest
of the Karnak clock.... The aperture of the
Karnak clock is a distance of 4f below the
lower end of the lZf scale. The variations in the scales from month to
month must now be considered. In the Karnak example. the scalc lengths
in terms of fingerbreadths "r: are
approximately as followsl

3rd and 5th months .13 2/3 r
4th month....14 r
The errors are almost negligible except in
the case of the rigure 13 r. which is .25 r too
great. These rigures show that a uniform change
of 1/3 r per month was intended.
The second piece of literary evidence that might bear on the development of the water clock dates from about the same period as the rirst, i.e., the reign of
Amenhotep I. is less certainly connected with a water clock of the Karnak type or in fact any water clock. However, a good case for its pertinence to water clocks

can be made. This is the Ebers calendar. which has been mentioned earlier and translated below as Document 111.2. This document has a first column consisting of the eponymous feast days of 12 months of a truncated Sothic year beginning with the rising of Sirius (and, like water clocks, without epagomenal days) and a second column listing the ninth day of each of the corresponding months of the civil year, this year being the ninth year of the reign of Amenhotep I. I believe that this calendar or equivalency table was composed to aid in constructing or using a water clock like the Karnak clock. As in the case of the Karnak clock the prospective clock maker could have placed the 12 months of the civil year about the rim of the vessel. Then he could have found out from the Ebers or similar Sothic-civil double calendar which civil month in the ninth year of Amenhotep's reign is equivalent to the Sothic month that includes the shortest night. i.e.. the month that includes the summer solstice. No doubt he would know that this would be in the 11th Sothic month. the first month of that year being the time of the appearance of Sirius. Then he would simply put the
shortest monthly scale (say the 12f scale) under the proper month name on the water clock he is constructing. that is, under the current civil month II Shemu, as the Ebers table would show him. He could then do the same thing for the longest hour scale (say.
the l4f scale), and for all the intervening scales, assuming. as the maker of the Karnak clock did. that the
hour scales uniformly varied in length by 1/3 f each month. This in fact may have been what Amenemhet did, i.e.• construct such a clock of the Karnak variety after studying the literature and devising the monthly scales. Perhaps its originality lay in his placing all

twelve scales in one clock with a single aperture. Or it is possible that the hour watchers at this time had at their disposal a kind of fixed water clock where the scales had been inserted under the rubrics of the months of the fixed Sothic year. Then the watcher could simply look in the second column of the Ebers or similar calendar for the civil day and month he was
using the clock. Opposite it he could then find the equivalent Sothic month and thus was able to know which hour scale on the water clock to use. The only difficulty in this last reconstruction is that so far we have not found any early water clock of the fixed season variety. Furthermore. if such a clock with monthly scales of hours already eXisted. we must wonder why Amenemhet would have bothered to single out his construction of a water clock as an achievement
to record in his tomb. A few remarks regarding other outflow clocks are in order. Borchardt has shown that the fundamental scale of 12 fingerbreadths that was used in the Karnak clock for the shortest night appears in other clods to have been used as the scale for the months embracing the equinoxes. so that the scale for the shortest night was 11 fingerbreadths. for the equinoxes 12. and for the
longest night 13.90 Although in the Karnak clock the monthly scales vary in length by the constant amount of 1/3 of a fingerbreadth per month, these variations do not represent the actual changes of the lengths of the night from month to month, regardless of whether one defines the night as lasting from first darkness to last darkness or sunset to sunrise. The clocks that have the 12 fingcrbreadths scale as the length of the hourly scale at the time of the equinoxes-all from the Alexandrine period <Borchardt's clocks nos. 2-4}-attempt to correct

the constant changes of the scale lengths to take into account the fact that the length of night chllnges most slowly during the months immediately preceding and following the shortest or the longest night. i.e., the nights of the summer and winter solstices. and most rapidly in the months immediately preceding and following the months containing the equinoxes. Instead of the constant relationship 1:1:1 they have what appears
to be an incremental relationship of m,2:3.91 i.e., where the increments or decrements of the scale lengths of the months preceding or following the lengths of the scales of the solstitial months are 1/3 of II fingerbrclldth. followed by 213 of a ringerbreadth. then by I fingerbreadth. or of course the reverse relationships where the increments or decrements are related as 3,2:l11 preceding or following the equinoctial months. Another fragment of an outflow clock (Borchardt's no. 9; see Fig. 111.27) yields a curious set of scale
lengths, ? II. II 112, 12. 13. 13 2/3. 14. where 12
fingerbreadths give the length of the equinoctial scales. The second half of the set of scales shows the 3,2,1 relalionship noted in clocks 2-4. DUI the top part of the scale deviates from it. and I see no ready
explanation for this deviation, for one would expect it to show the same 3,2:1 relationship as the bottom half. There is always the possibility that the clock was carelessly constructed or that it was simply made to serve as part of the tomb furniture for some worthy deceased and hence was not actually meant to be used in this world. In discussing the monthly hour scales I have paid little attention to the distance between the hourly marks. except to note that certainly in the early outflow clocks and probably in all Egyptian water

clocks the assumption was that they were to be equally spaced. that is, that the water level sank equal distances in equal times. However this was not a fact. the segment of the vessel bearing the scales being a truncated cone that could only produce an approximated even rIow instead of being the segment of a paraboloid which would yield steady flow. Presumably the users of such a clock must have realized Ihllt the flow was not uniform. Indeed there is evidence that points in that dircC[ion from a papyrus of the third century A.D. which sought to determine the volumetric discharge of water between the various
hourly marks.9Z The text is corrupt and includes some
wrong numbersl it lakes 1C as 3 and the basic formula it uses for the volume of a frustum of a cone is incorrect. The pertinent part of this determination begins in Grenfell and Hunt's text in line 31t They give the number(sl for the construction of horologes as follows, making the (diameter of thel upper part of the frustum 24 fingerbreadths. hhat of the basel 12 fingerbreadths, and the height 18 fingerbreadths (see Fig. 111.28). The volume of each segment of the frustum having a height of one fingerbreadth is determined, according to the papyrus, by finding the mean sectional area (j.e., 2 x T x 1/4 x 21fT· 1f?, with the value of ,.. taken as 3) and multiplying this by the height (j.e., I fingerbreadth). This involves the incorrect assumption that that volume
of the frustum is equal to a cylindrical segment whose radius is equal to that of [he mean area of the segment of the frustum. Since the over-all height of the frustum is 18 fingerbreadths. the volume would be the
sum of all the segments of I frustum height. It is not at

all cleaT how this incorrect volumetric analysis was to be used. but possibly the clock makers thought they could adjust the hour markers to produce what they thought were equal quantities being discharged in equal
times, though of course that would not be completely accurate so long as they were using the wrong Cormula for the volume of a frustum of a conc. But whatever the explanation of this curious fragment, it certainly seems that in Pharaonic Egypt the hour-watchers thought the hour markings ought to be equidistant and that the shape of their pot produced this uniform flow. As we have said earlier. precisely equal flow (other things being equal) could only have been produced by 8 vessel with 8 paraboloidal surface (see the parabolic section of such a paraboloid in Fig. 111.291 However. as further shown in Fig. 111.29. a vessel with a slope of 2,9 and thus an angle of inclination of about 770 measured between the pot wall and the base extended (see the left side of the rigure)
would produce a very good approximation. Less satisfactory is a pot with a slope of 1,3 <like that given in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus; see the right side of Fig. 111.29). And even less satishctory is the angle of inclination of the Karnak clock, namely 700 25'. The angles determinable for the other clocks whose fragments we possess are of still lesser inclination to
the base extended than that of the Karnak c1ock.93 Borchardt completes his discussion of hourly scales by showing quantitatively that neither the Karnak clock nor the clock discussed in the Oxyrhynchus papyrus will produce equal hours. This is clear from the table I have reproduced here as Fig. 111.30 and the linear scales of Fig. 111.31.

periods leads to his principal conclusion thai the Karnak clock measures the hours of what he calls the "astronomical night: i.e., the period from the beginning of darkness to its end, with the morning and evening twilights excluded,94 I call the rcader's attention to one last point concerning the various outnow clocks discussed by
Borchardt. namely their dating. where possible. by the position of the shortest and longest monthly scales in the civil calendar Hor 8 useful table showing where the seasons fall in the civil year at dirrerent Julian dates see Fig. 111.37).95 There is no particular need to review that discussion here. since I have given the specific
dates as we have mentioned the various outflow c10clcs and have morc than once indicated how they were
found. most particularly when J described the probable use of the Ebers calendar for the construction and use of water clocks.
Inflow Water Clocks The only Egyptian water clock of the inflow type is that found by 'G. Maspero at Edfu in 1901 (see Fig. 111.23), though a number of small models. which were probably used as votive offerings. are extant (Fig. 111.32).96 The Edfu clock is a cylindrical vessel of limestone unadorned on the exterior except for a small representation in relief of Thoth as the cynocephalic baboon placed immediately above an aperture for draining the water in the clock.97 On the interior surface of the vessel is a poorly drawn grid embracing vertical monthly hour scales intersected by horizontal sloping lines at the hour points (see Fig. 111.33). As an inflow vessel. the Edfu clock performs its time-telling

duty by having waler flow into the vessel from a reservoir and reading its level against one of tbe monthly hour scales. The great advantage that such a
clock has over the oulnaw type is tbat if the reservoir is kept full constantly the head of inflowing water will remain the same and hence in theory the water flowing into the clock will rise at 8 constant Tate. Before slarting the clock at the beginning of the night. tbe waler is drained from the vessel to the lowest marlc on the hourly scale appropriate for the month that it is
being used. It would. of course. be very difficult to read the watcr level against the scales on the interior of the cylindrical vessel. Hence the bour-watcher would surely benefit from some kind of movable float with an extended pointer which could be set at the proper month. This pointer could then indicate the hour on the exterior surface of a column that possessed
a duplicate hourly grid and was attached to the top of the vesseJ.98 However no such attachments have been found. Turning to the grid with its vertical monthly scales and intersecting sloping lines. we must first note that it preserves still the Old Egyptian system developed by Amenemhet and appearing in the Karnak clock of having 12-fingerbreadth and 14-fingerbreadth scale lengths for the months containing the summer and winter solstices. and 13-fingerbreadth scales for the months with the equinoxes. But a significant change in the distribution of the vertical scales, that is, in the horizontal distances between the scales, is signalled by the interior diagram on the &lfu clock, where the distances vary erroneously as 3:2:1 1 1,213; 3:2,1; 1:2,3, beginning from a 14-fingerbreadth scale, though according to the phenomenon of slower increments and

It was Alexander Pogo who first explained the significance of this feature of distance displacement. suggested its possible origin in some earlier prismatic' inflow clock. and revclIled the error made by the &Uu clock maker in applying the 3,2,1 relationship to the distances from the solstitial scales,99 [Following the discovery of the 12- and 14·fingerbreadth scales and the concurrent assumption that the monthly scales varied uniformly in length from month to month by 1/3 of a CingerbrclIdth,] The next step in the development of waler clocks -made.

The lengths of the Edfu scales increase and decrease by the traditional amounts, 1112, 1/6. and 1/4 of the difference between the longest and the shortest night. but the wrong starting point of the 1,2,3 count leads to slow changes of the lengths of the scales ncar the cquinoxes. and to rapid changcs ncar thc solsticcs-an absurdity which failed to shock the maker of the Edru clock..Iwhol did not understand the meaning or the 1,2,3 diagram. While there is no archaeological evidence to support Pogo's ingenious reconstruction other than the existence or models or prismatic inrJow clocks (which or course had no interior grids), it seems to me inherently probable. However. we might well temper somewhat his judgment that the inflow clock with its interior grid was a truly original discovery and thus an outstanding event in the history or science (sce note 103 below). for he does not mention the fact that the



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
makers of some extant outflo.... clocks (earlier than the Edfu clod) had already altered the lengths of their monthly scales so that the increments follo....ed a h213 relationship. thus making a start to....ard recognizing the observation that the lengths of the nights changed most slowly before and after the solstices and more rapidly before and after the equinoxes. Furthermore. Pogo is less than successful in trying to push the invention of the prismatic inflow clock and interior diagram back to Dynasty 18. While recognizing that the models of the inflo.... clocks are more than a millennium later than the Karnak outflow clock. he ·argues the possible earlier existence of a prismatic inflow clock of the ·chevrons· type from a relief in the Luxor temple dated to the time of Amenhotep III <See Fig. 111.36).100 In this relief. Amenhotep III is shown
presenting a votive oHering (lC) to the goddess Mut
which Pogo says "might be described as a prismatic lin receptacle. with a squatting cynocephalos attached to

This rendering would underline its significance in the presentation scene as concerned with "the giving of life forever: Because of the clear link between the monthly scales of the out now and inflow clocks. it seems
probable that in Egypt, at least during the Pharaonic period we are concerned with, the innow clocks were primarily used to tell the time of Borchardt's "astronomical night: i.e., the period of total darkness without the morning and evening twilights. However when the innow clocks spread from Egypt [and no doubt especially from Alexandria] through the classical world,104 changes and improvements were made so that this was no longer true. Sioley has described briefly these later water clocks and mentions their use in
public places.1OS
Shadow Clocks The determination of hours in the daytime during

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
the Pharaonic period ....as based on the sun's motion and its projection of shadows. Hence the basis of marking
daytime bours is quite distinct hom that of marking the nighttime days. which. we have seen. was rooted in the risings or meridian transits of stars and in the outflow or inflow of watcr from water clocks. The only assumed similarity is that the length of daylight (initially including morning and evening twilights) was
assumed to be divided into 12 hours just as was the length of nighttime. There are two main types of sun-clocks. The first is an instrument to measure the length of shadows projected upon it and is usually simply called a shadow
clock: the second measures the hours by the changing direction of a shadow projected during the daily course of the sun's motion; they are of course known as sundials. Let us first examine shadow clocks. Telling time by shadows appears to be alluded to in a well-known passage from The Prophecies of Neferti quoted above in Volume One (page 402) to the effect that during the time of unhappy conditions preceding the Middle Kingdom "Re separates himself from men; he shines that the hour [of dawn] may be told, but no one knows when noon occurs, for no one can discern [or
measure?] his shadow:106 The use of "measure· or "number" instead of "discern" by some authors may result from their desire to push the history of the shadow clock at least to the Middle Kingdom. The first (and indeed the only) Egyptian technical
description of an ancient Egyptian shadow clock is found in an inscription in the cenotaph of $eti I (ca. 1306-1290). This is given in translation below (Document 111.16), with the text transcribed in Fig. 111.38. The shadow clock (SI'r) so described (see Fig.
"84



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
111.39) consists of a horizontal board (mrtwt) 5 palms (20 fingcrbreadths • ca. IS") in length with a vertical head (tp) aHixed at one end. Attached to the vertical head is a crossbar (mr!Jt)07 2 fingerhreadths in height whose vertical plane is perpendicular to the horizontal board. Marked ("branded") on the board are signs that
measure the hours.JOB The first is 30 units from the vertical head, the second 12 units neater, the third 9 ncarer, the fourth 6 nearer, and the distance from the fourth sign to the vertical head is 3 units. the signs being placed to measure four "hours: The horizontal board was first aligned to the east with the head pointing in that direction. Accordingly. the crossbar then pointed toward the north and the horizontal board was probably leveled by a plumb line, as is evident from the shadow clocks that have come down to us, though no such procedure is mentioned in the text. When the shadow falls on the first mark it begins to measure the first of four hours before noon. When it reaches the second mark the first hour is completed, and so on until the shadow length on the horizontal board comes to an end and noon has been reached. Then, as the text tells us, the shadow clock is reversed so that the head points to the west, and the lengthening shadow falling on the marks indicates the passage of
the next four hours. Now it should be noticed that only eight hours have been marked off for measurement by the clock. But the text goes on to tell us that °2
hours have passed in the morning before the sun shines [on the shadow clock] and IWO hours [will] pass before the sun enters [the Duat or realm of darkness] to fix the place of the hours of night [j.e., before darkness arrives and the hours of the night begin]." Hence it is clear that the author of Ihis piece assumed that the
-65



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
daylight (with the twilights) was divided into( 12 hours. The selection of t ....elve hours seems to have been made in imitation of the division of the night into 12 hours
necessitated by the civil calendar with its division inlo
36 decades. According to Neugebauer and Parker.109 the "most plausible assumption [concerning the four
extra hours not measured by the clock] is that sunrise and sunset, .... hich are observable phenomena. mark the dividing points between the two extra hours before and after the central 8: This leads to their belief that this account describes a clock that is much earlier than the time of the cenotaph of Seli I, for the first extant shadow clock. preserved from the time of Tuthmosis III (ca. 1479-1425 B.C.l, though very much like the shadow clock here described. has 5 instead of 4 hour marks, thus supposing a 10 hour clock with 2 extra hours and thus a day of 1.10.1 hours. the 12-hour day perhaps beginning with sunrise and ending with sunset. Or it could be that the 5 marks simply indicated a decimal division of the day with two additional intervals to
connect it to the 12-hour nighttime.
Now it is evident that the maries on the Seti clock (those accompanied by Roman numerals on straight line E in Fig. 11I.40) indicate the central hours at the time of the equinoxes, while the marks with Arabic numerals marlc the central hours in the 5-mark clock from the time of Tuthmosis III. But even if these marks correctly measured equal hours at the equinoxes (which they did not), they would not have accurately marked the lengths of those hours at other times of the year in view of the changing declination of the sun throughout the year. This is evident again from Fig. 1IJ.40, where the marks of the hours fall on points on the hyperbolic curves Wand S representing in each case the shadow

end's movement at the winter solstice (W) and the summer solstice (5), and the shadow end passing through a point on the curve marking a given hour at either of those times of the year would not fall on the horizontal board. Le., on line E. in such a way that it would pass through the corresponding hour mark on E. Hence the original hour markings would not serve to mark the hours correctly at the summer and winter solstices. However, since. the Egyptians did not appear
10 be exacting about the equality of the hour lengths. as we have already shown to be the case for the hours
measured by water clocks. they probably used the early shadow clocks during the whole year without concern. But see Document 111.16, notc 2, for Bruins' clever suggestion that in Seti's c10cle a properly thin strip was added to or removed from the crossbar to change its height and thus to accommodate the c10cle to the changing declination of the sun at the times of the winter solstice, the equinoxes, and the summer solstice. Still, it should be remarked that none of the extant shadow c10cles included a crossbar or thin strips to be added to that bar but only an end block with a groove for hanging a plummet line on it. In fact it is not clear from the tcxt in the cenotaph of Seti I that the shadow clock included a cross bar mounted on the vcrtical end piece as is usually depicted (see Fig. 1I1.39). For the name mrf1t translated in Document 111.16. line 10. as "crossbar" could just as well refer to the vertical block alone. especially if the block contained a groove for the plummet line. Furthermore, the illustration of the shadow clock which accompanies the text (see Fig. 111.38) does not reveal any crossbar distinct from the vertical head; it merely shows the whole instrument in profile as an L with a short vertical upright. Of course.

if the vertical upright and a8 attached crossbar 'lVere the 'same thickness. the crossbar might well not show in a profile view. But the principal rcason for assuming that II crossbar (much longer tban tbe vertical block) was attached to the vertical block was that the shadow clock was apparently used throughout the year. And so in all probability 8 longer crossbar was needed to ensure that part of the line terminating the shadow always fell on the ratber narrow horizontal board during the four measured hours at all times of the ycar. Now 1 am prepared to examine actual shadow
clocks that have been preserved from ancient Egypt.IIO
I have already brierly mentioned the earliest one dating from tbe reign of Tuthmosis III (see Fig. 11I.41. West Berlin Mus. Nr, 19744. with separate eodpiece above it from the reign of Nebmaatre, i.e., Amenhotep Ill, No. 14573). A clock from Sais (Fig. 11I.41, West Berlin Mus. Nr. 19743) dates from 500 or more years later: it is
quite similar to the Tuthmosis clock but larger and more intact. Following Borchardt's treatment,lll I shall concentrate on the latter. The base is a ruler of about 30 em. in length. At one end is a small vertical, rectangular block mounted perpendicularly on the base ruler. The vertical block has been pierced through its length by a narrow boring and a groove has been scratched out on one of the pierced surfaces, the boring and the groove being used
to mount and guide a plummet line for the purpose of ensuring that the shadow clock lies on a level surface.
Borchardt surmises that the plummet would not be peeded very orten since a known level surface such as the roof of a temple would have been readily available. On the upper surface of the base ruler we find five circular markings that indicate the passage of the hours

CALENDARS. CLOCKS. ASTRONOMY
(no circle is found at the end of the sixth hour since the vertical upright serves instead), the intervlIls between the hours decreasing in lincar fashion from the mark of the nrst hour toward the end of the rule up to the upright which marks the end of the sixth hour (j.e.• the intervals are diminished by decreasing multiples of the distance from the vertical upright to' the marlc ending the fifth hour). Accompanying these markings are the names of the first six hours (that is, the names of their protective goddesses), the first hour lasting until before the sun projects a shadow on the rule which reaches the first marking. The names follow (see Fig. 111.42 for their hieroglyphic signs), 1st Hour-The Rising One. 2nd Hour-The Introductory (or Guiding) One. 3rd Hour-The Protector of Her Lord. 4th Hour-The Secret One. 5th Hour-The Flaming One, 6th Hour-Thc Standing One,lll
It is obvious by the description I have just given that this shadow clock is used in a manner closely similar to that of the Seti clock we have already discussed. The base ruler lies in the east-west direction and the upright block with an assumed linear crossbar
mounted on i! accordingly lies in the north-south direction. Borchardt assumes such a crossbar mounted on the vertical blod. for. as I have said before. the vertical block by itself is so narrow that the shadow would at all hours fall on the hour maries only at the periods of the equinoxes. At the periods of the
solstices it would fall widely north and south of the narrow baseboard and therefore not on the hour marks. Therefore. Borchardt suggests that perhaps a cross bar ought to have been mounted on the vcrtical board so that in all seasons some piece of the shadow of the crossbar will fall on the graduatcd baseboard (see
-89



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
Borchardt's drawing given below as Fig, 111.43), Borchardt further points out thai the graduation of hours on the baseboard does not produce equal hours even at the times of the equinoxes. This is immediately evident from the fact that the increments of the intervals between the hour marks decrease by linearly decreasing multiples of 8 constant distance. This is an approximation much too simple to represent the complicated changes in shadow length (and their intercepts on the baseboard) produced by the angular changes in the sun's height in the course of the sun's apparent daily motion. This is not surprising in view of the complete: absence of simple trigonometric calculations among the ancient Egyptians. for in order to determine shadow lengths and above all their linear
intercepts on the ruler with the hourly graduations at the times of the equinoxes we would need to know the trigonometric functions of 150, 300, 450, etc. Their values could not be exactly expressed using a simple arithmetical series of numbers. We might, however. Ienow more about the ancient theory lying behind the graduation of the later shadow clods if we had an intact version rather than charred remains of a papyrus

investigation of the approximate deviation of its hour graduations from equal hours. Moreover. in Fig. 111.46 is shown 8 system for using II 5-edged beveled crossbar (Borchardt's 'sacred cubit') in three dirrerent positions to produce shadows which mark equal hours, At
sunrise the crossbar would be in position I. The first
hour would be completed when the shadow's end fell on
the first hour mark. The bar would then be changed 10 position 2. and the second hour would be completed when the shadow fell on the second hour mark. At this
time the crossbar would be shifted to position 3. For the fourth hour the bar would be shifted back to position 2. for the fifth back 10 position I, and fot the
sixth hour it is left in position I or shifted to position
3. The diagram of Fig, 111.46 indicates how these positional changes produce the appropriate shadows, One cannot emphasize too strongly, however, that there is no actual evidence that such a beveled crossbar was
used, and I suspect that the apparent indirrerence of the ancient Egyptians to the exact divisions into equal
hours of any of their docks makes their use of this device unlikely. Indeed. Borchardt himself does not insist that such a crossbar was used, though he believes that its use was a possibility.1l3
Before leaving our treatment of shadow docks with their base rules oriented in an east-west direction.
mention must be made of a model of a sun clock prepared in sort white limestone and now in the Cairo Museum (No. 33401).114 This is later than the Berlin
shadow clocks we have already described. It represents
three dirrerent kinds of shadow clocks (see Figs. 111.47 and 111.48>. the first with the scale on a flat, level surface like the Berlin shadow clocks. the second in which the shadow falls on stepped surfaces. lind the

third in which the shadow falls on an inclined plane. The clocks with 8 stepped or inclined surface fot the reception of the shadows makes possible the reduction in the length of the shadow-receiving surface that was necessary when using a fat. level baseboard to measure the early and late hours. Notice that in representing the clock with the level surface. the vertical shadow producing block bas no crossbar attached. But presumably no such baT was needed (at least from the end of the second through the sixth hours) because the graduated shadow-receiving surface is not narrow as in the case of the Berlin shadow clocks but is instead wide. so that some portion of the shadow's ・ョ、セャゥョ・ would probably fall on the surface regardless of the season of the year if we had a real clock rather than merely an illustrative model. In view of the fact that we have only this model and we do not have any idea as to the latitude for which each of its three clocks was designed for and that we are not sure how faith£ully the model re£lects the proportions of the real clocks it represents. any extended analysis of real or potential hourly graduations like that given by Borchardt can
hardly be more than educated guesswork iJlustrating the way in which the clocks functioned. However, after noting that the hourly graduations on the level-surface and stepped-surface clocks. even if they were correct
for the equinoxes, would be incorrect for any other days of the year. Borchardt suggests that the inclined-plane clock (without graduations of any kind on the model) could h8ve had scales that were to be mounted and usable for other days of the year as well (see Fig, 111.49).
It should be realized that the particular inclined-plane clock of the Cairo model like the other

CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
two clocks represented on it was also to be fixed in an cast-west orientation so that like them the hourly graduations represented the east-west intercepts of the
shadow produced by the sun falling on the vertical edges. However there are evidences of another type of
inclined-plane clock that was meant to be movable and was not maintained in an cast-west orientation (see Fig.
111.50 for several examplcsl115 At whatever time the
clock was to be read. its vertical block was pointed directly at the sun so that the sun's rays were always perpendicular to the shadow producing edge of the vertical block with the consequence that the shadow of the block fell completely and exclusively on the inclined plane (see Fig. 111.51>, and indeed the lack of any side shadow would be an indication that the sun-pointing clock was properly oriented, In view of the orientation of the clock directly toward the sun, the
hourly scales on the inclined surface measured the direct length of the shadows rather than the intercepts of those shadows on an east-west oriented rule as was the case in the earlier shadow clocks we have been describing. The first of these sun-pointing shadow clocks <the one from Qantara, Fig, 111.50, J) is datable to about 320
B.c, (plus or minus 60 years). It is shaped like the halves of the inclined-plane clock represented on the Cairo model. On the Icft vertical block from which the inclined plane begins to rise there is a groove for a plumb line used to level the clock, On the inclined surface are seven scales of varying length, each of which has six hour points, Beyond the incline is 8 right hand block on the lOp surface of which are the names of the Egyptian months given in Greek so that the longest scale (on which the midday shadow would

The fact that the longest scale (which would
be the scale to be used at the summer solstice) is assigned to the month Pharmuthi of the 365-day civil year indicates that the dock scales were designed for the year of 320 B.C. (with a leeway of 60 years before and after that date), as I have said. The only other of these sun-pointing clocks complete enough to date even roughly is that of Paris clock shown in Fig. 111.50. no. 2. The Egyptian month names on this clock are also written in Greek. The longest scale there is for Payni and the shortest for Choiak. Since the summer solstice fell at the end of the 10th month (Payni> in the fixed Alexandrine year. it is evident that the Alexandrine calendar underlies the scales of the Paris clock. Hence all we can say about the date of that clock is that its scales must date to the Roman period sometime after Augustus' introduction of the Alexandrine calendar into Egypt in 25 llC. One last point can be made concerning these
ウオョセーッゥョエゥョァ shadow clocks. It evident that the Egyptians constructed the various scales so that straight lines could connect the corresponding hour points. e.g.• a straight line would connect the points designating the first hour in all seven scales. as seems to be confirmed in a fragment in the Petrie Museum at University College.

We note finally that hieroglyphics representing some of the shadow clocks we have discussed were used in the Ptolemaic period either as delcrminatives for the word "hour' or by themselves as ideograms for
that word (see fig, 111.54),
Egyptian Sundials The sun clocks described in the preceding section
measured shadow lengths projected by the sun orr the edge of a vertical upright and they depended on the altitude of the sun. The other major kind of sun clock found in ancient Egypt was the vertical-plane sundial. which. of course. measured the hours by the changing angular direction of the shadow of a gnomon produced by the sun during its daily motion. I shall consider here two examples which are clearly of Egyptian origin. The fragment of a third dial found at Dendera. which includes only the radial lines marking the six hours arter noon (Fig. 111.558). seems to be completely similar to the rirst two examples and so I shall not examine it. The rirst of the Egyptian sundials is 8 small ivory
disk found at Gezer in Palestinel11 (see Fig. 1II.55bl It
dates from the reign of Merenptah (ca. 1224-1214 o.c.).

rrant of the disk we see the remains of 10 radiating
lines ((rom a set that almost certainly originally contained 13 such lines. with the angles between t ....o successive lines each being about 15°). The.diamcter of the dial is about 2 1/4 inches. with its centcr being evident from II small circle on the back. One can sec

The inscriptions of figures and radial lines ....ere originally filled with green enamel. some of which remains. Presumably. when intact, a style (j.e.. a gnomon) must have been set into a hole in the centcr of the diameter of the semicircular dial face for the purpose of casting the angularly changing shadow. The second dial (i.e., its face) is just like the first
one but more complete (Fig. 11I.56>. It is made of a green fayence that suggested to Borchardt that it ....as
probably fashioned in the Greco-Roman period.na The dial was acquired at Luxor and is a part of the West Berlin Museum collection (No. 20322). Since the dial is intact (except for the gnomon) it contains 13 lines radiating from the center hole. Tbe first and last line together make a straight line. to which the 7th line (marking midday) is almost perpendicular. The dial is without any decoration. As one can see in the drawing of Fig. 11I57. left. the dial was hung vertically by a cord supported from two eyes in the rear rather tban from a cord passing through a channel bored lengthwise through the top of the clod. as in the case of Merenptah's sundial. A now missing gnomon for projc<:ting the movable shadow was inserted in the center hole and so stood perpendicular to the dial face. Tbere remains above the center hole a rectangular

recess. That recess apparently allowed for hanging a
plumb line necessary for positioning the dial correctly.
It is clear from the way the sundials were made that
for their use the straight line consisting of the first and last radial lines had to be level and that the dial surface had to bang in an east-west plane. The plumb line accomplished the first of these conditions when that line was parallel to the 7th radial line. The second condition was met by using it in a place where the cast-west line had been previously established. This clock like all the other clocks we have examined did not mcasure equal hours at lIny time of the year. At the time of the equinoxes, the 1st and 12th hours were each too long. as were the 2nd and the 11th; the 3rd and the 10th hours, as well as the 4th and 9th, were each approximately one daylight hour long; and the 5th and the 8th hours. as well as the 6th and the 7th, were each too short. This is clear from fig, 11I.57. right, which indicates the results of Borchardfs
investigation of the Berlin clock for an assumed latitude of 25.50. In that figure the bold radial hour lines are those inscribed on the clock and thus end at the
circumference of the disk. Near the end line of each hour (except the 6th and the 12th) is a set of three extended lines: two broken lines and one that is continuous. The broken line at the greatest angle indicates the proper marker for the hour at the winter solstice, the middle continuous line represents the desired marker for that hour at the time of the equinoxes, and the broken "line at the least: angle is the suggested marker for that hour at the time of the summer solstice. This figure then not only shows us that the radial lines did not mark equally long hours at the time of the equinoxes. but. as expected. they also

failed to do so at the solstitial times.
It is evident from my treatment of the various kinds of Egyptian clocks (star clocks. water clocks. shadow clocks. and sundials) that there is great diversity in their accuracy and their methods of telling time. Indeed these various kinds of clocks share virtually nothing in their theoretical underpinnings, except of course the division into day and night hours and the seasonal variability of hour lengths (which is
ignored in all but the water clocks aod the
inclined-plane. sun-pointing clock), It seems apparent that hom at least the New Kingdom onward all of the types of clocks we have described were in use despite their diversity. This is one more instance of the fact that emerged in the first volume in my treatment or cosmogony and cosmologYl the Egyptians ohen accepted essentially contradictory and mutually inconsistent practices. doctrines and modes or thought without great concern.

into 24 equal hours. It is this latcr division that J now mention. Two documents (and the fragment of a third) refer to such divisions. The first (my Document 111.7 but only given here in the body of Chapter Three and not in the section of documents) is II table added on folio XIV verso of Cairo Papyrus No. 86637. a Ramesside papyrus of about the twelfth century 8.C,I19 The date of the hour table given in the text is earlier, falling between about 1400 B.C. and 1280 8.C.12O Its hieratic text is shown in Fig. 1II.58a and ils hieroglyphic transcription is given in Fig. 1Il.5gb.

been already established:122 Most puzzling is the fact that the table reports values that seem to yield 311 8S the ratio of the longest daylight to the shortest. 8 ratio that Clerc declared to be a fantasy. As Neugebauer and Parker note,123 this ratio corresponds to no locality in Egypt "if 'day' would mean the interval from sunrise to sunset." However they suggest that if the longest daylight was merely the complement of the shortest "night" of 12 decanal hours and the latter is worked out in accordance with their analysis of the elapsed limes of decanal hours, this would produce a shortest night of about 6 hours in agreement with the table we have been examining. However it still does not explain the extreme ratio of SセQN "particularly in view of the scales in the ratio of 7 to 6 of the Karnale water clock which malees the difference between winter and summer night smaller than it should be: Further note should be taleen of the table's technically incorrect assumption that the length of daylight from month to month increases and decreases in a linear fashion, which, as we have seen, was 81so assumed in the scales of water clocks. The

constant monthly increment or decrement in our table is 2 hours. At any rate the fact that in none of their clocks did the ancient Egyptians produce series of truly equal hours. makes any modern assumption that they used accurate equinoctial hours from month to month over the whole year in this and the succeeding table exceedingly unlikely. A second table of the lengths of daylight and nighttime at IS-day intervals (my Document 111.8, presented only here in this chapter and not in the section comprising documents) appears on a stone plaque discovered in Tanis in 1947.124 Though the date of the plaque is not certain. it probably dales from the
time of Necho II in Dynasty 26.125 The incomplete plaque and another fragment discovered in 1948 contain four Texts. Text No. II is the table under consideration.

Clere suggests that unlike the Ramesside table, which is a schematized table where the values seem to have been arbitrarily chosen, with their succeeding increments and decrements being 8 fixed two hours each month. the Tanis table despite its gross incompleteness and inaccuracies has no trace of schematization of the values. In elaboration he continues:128 One does not rind either regular progression or
parallelism in the sequences. The few observable concordances (for example, the same duration of 12 h. 25 m. for the daylight one month before. and for the night one month afler the autumnal equinox. 15.IV.prd are certainly fortuitous-except. doubtless. for the duration of 12 hours. which. placed at a 6-month interval and a mid-distance between the solstitial days. ought to have been intentionally regularized to bear witness of the understanding that the Egyptians had of
the phenomenon of the equinoxes"..The duration-values of the text of Tanis certainly rest upon observations and. if they differ from
the actual values. it could only be that some of the errors were owing to the imperfection of the measuring instruments employed to determine them. There could, of course, also have been copyist crrors.
It was also observed by Clere that the use of fractional hour measurements in this table demonstrated that the Egyptians did not simply use successive divisions by
-Kl3



ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
two or three in their tables as some people have thought. but that their hour divisions were duodecimally based. doubtless in imitation of their division of the year into twelve months and the day
and night into twelve hours.129 The obvious difficulty of measuring accurately time units as small as twelfths of an hour ....hen the Egyptians could not even accurately measure the length of an hour itself strongly contradicts the suggested observational base of the table and points rather to some more arbitrary mathematical schematization of the table that Clerc initially rejected. Finally we can notc that Clerc produced a table of his own comparing the values for 13 days that survive in the Tanis table with actual values
of the duration of daylight on those days estimated for several cities in Egypt (see Fig. 111.60. We can complete our consideration of the Tanis table by examining the analysis of it made by
Neugebauer and Parker. It stands on its own and is worth quoting in fuJI. especially since in the course of their analysis they reject Clere's suggestion that the table was established by means of observation. Here then are the remarks of Neugebauer and Parker:130 This list concerns the length of daylight and night. expressed in equinoctial hours. Unfortunately only 13 of the original 24 data for the length of daylight are preserved. They are indicated in our Figure 10 [see my
Fig. m.60], by blaclc dots when both daylight and night are given. and their total is 24 (hours]. In all other cases only one of the two values is preserved. Four values of the thirteen conform to 8 pattern one would expect for lower Egypt.

The longest daylight. at the beginning of I and
II prt. is 14h, corresponding to the standard
Hellenistic norm which assumes a ratio 14h:l()h for the extrema. The equinoxes are located in
II '!Jt 15 and IV prt 15 in conformity to the solstice data.
It would be natural to expect from this arrangement a linear scheme for the remaining values. following a well-known paltern of Hellenistic astronomy. Such a scheme is
indicated in our figure by the dotted line. It
would require a constant difference of ± 24 minutes for each IS-day interval. None of the preserved data, however, agrees with such a scheme. A constant increase occurs only once (J 'hr 15 to II 'ht 15) but with 30 minutes

instead of 24; a constant decrease of 2S minutes per month Onstead of 48) is found between III prt 15 and I 5mw 15. The remaining values follow no recognizable pattern, not even as far as the necessary symmetries are concerned. The minimum is 9
1/3h instead of the expected l()h; finally 22h in II 5mw I is an obvious scribal error (for II?), The absence of any strict regularity caused Clere to assume that the data of the
text were based on observations. It is, of course, impossible to disprove such an explanation. On the other hand 8 month by month observation of lengths of daylight and night with relatively high accuracy (down to twelfths of hours. Le., 5 minutes) falls
completely outside the experience we have elsewhere with the handling of the problem of

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
variable daylight. The norm is al....ays a
simple ratio of longest to shortest day and for the intervening dala either linear variation or linear variation of the rising times. The occurrence of small fractions also speaks more in favor of some arithmetical process. perhaps incorrectly applied. than of direct measurements with very finely calibrated water clocks. That the lengths of daylight and night were not observed independently is obvious since such observations could not result in a constant total of exactly 24 bours. Hence
either daylight or night would need to be
observed and the other part found by subtraction from 24. Since the water clock
seems to be the only instrument available for this purpose one could perhaps consider the length of night as the basic interval. But whatever the measured interval may be it seems extremely unlikely that observations would result in equinoxes spaced exactly six months apart or in a neat longest daylight of
14h from I prt 1 to II prt I. An original poorly computed and badly copied text seems to be a historically more likely hypothesis.

number of the standard decimal stars and constellations used on the diagonal clocks we discussed earlier), planets. certain northern constellations with lIttending lind flanking deities. Various of these objects are also found on zodiacs which are combinations of Hellenistic concepts with traditional Egyptian elements; the zodiacs all date from the Greco-Roffian period. Needless to say I shall only describe and analyze a few representative monuments, emphasizing what the monuments tell us about the detail and extent of ancient Egyptian knowledge of the heavens. Before expanding my discussion of the standard arrangement of astronomical elements in celestial diagrams. a few pertinent words on the orientation of
monuments from Neugebauer and Parker are in order:132 The term ·orientation" should not be understood in an exact astronomical sense. Temples were usually directed with their main axis perpendicular to the Nile. thus generally east-west or west-east. But the course of the Nile can deviate considerably from its northerly direction and thus may bring the "northern" side of a ceiling decoration actually
to the west. as for example in the temple of Hathor at Dendera which lies south of the Nile on its great bend from Qena to NagC Hammadi and so looks almost due north. .."rather strict rules governed the position of the various elements of an astronomical composition with respect to the cardinal points.

When the areas of a ceiling or other monument are east and west of a north-south axis, then the eastern area has the same decorative elements as would the southern area, and similarly for west and north. To state it in another fashion. north and west oppose soutb and east.... On astronomical monuments which are fixed in place, then. we consistently rind the northern constellations on the north or west or northwest. while the decans. since they lie in a belt south of the ecliptic... , are consistently to the south or east or south-east. The arrangement of the various astronomical elements developed into an almost standard form that we can with some looseness call tbe Ancient Egyptian Celestial Diagram. In fact there are about six £llmilies
of the standard form. but not much wiJI be gained by describing all of the divergencies. Hence ....e shall confine our preliminary discussion to the standard arrangement. with only general and occasional remarks to family dirrerences. Initially we should recall. from our treatment earlier in the chapter. that the principal astronomical diagrams before the development of the standard celestial diagram were those of the diagonal docks of the coffins. We remember that, in the case of the docks dependent on risings (that go bad to the ninth or tenth dynasty), the ideal diagonal clock (never realized but inferred from those coffins that remain) in its columnar structure included the names of 36 decans applicable to the 36 decades of the year plus 12 decans for the epagomenal days. Between the 18th and 19th columns a

strip (designated as the ·V strip") included depictions of Nut. the Foreleg of an Ox (tbe Big Dipper), Orion, and Sothis (the goddess of the star Sirius). Some dirrerent dccans were selected for use in the clocks dependent on their culminations (meridian transits). In the ordinary celestial diagram which we are now considering all 36 decans of the diagonal clocks (or more or less than the 36) were listed but not in the dillgonal form. used on the coHins (see Figs, 111.2. iliA, 111.21, 111.22, III.65b and the detailed des<:ciption of the ceilings of the tombs of Scnmut lind Sct; below). Usually onc (or occasionally more than one) star accompanies the decanal name as II determinative. I( more than one, the stars indicated an attempt to represent a deea" consisting of more than one star. Furthermore liS our detlliled presentation in Documents 111.3 and iliA show. groups of stars appear in the columns below the decans. However. such star groupings or clusters are of little assistance in identifying the constellations they represent because the number and arrangements of stars for each group varies widely from monument to monument. Exceptions are those below the decans related to Orion and Sirius. which can be identified. at least roughly. The names of the deities associated with the decans are usually
included. but again not with great uniformity. Sometimes depictions (and not just the stars from which depictions were conceived) of the gods or possibly larger constellations associated with a number of the decans were also included. e.g.. a bark, a sheep. an egg. Orion in a bark. and Isis-Sothis in a bark.
In addition to the main 36 decans. the artists included the names of some (and perhaps in the original celestial diagram. if it were extant. aID of the 12

triangle decans used in the old star clocks for the hours during the epagomenaJ days: these triangle decans were
also accompanied by stars. their associated gods. and less frequently other material (such as a depiction of the constellation of the Two Tortoises under the decan §/lVy). After the last regular decan, that of Isis-Sothis (j.e.. Sirius). and before the triangle deities the names of the three outer planets <Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars, or sometimes only Jupiter and Saturn, Mars being omitted) were given and following the triangle decans the two inferior planets Mercury and Venus were added. As depictions of the exterior planets we find two or three figures of Horus in a bark. For Venus the deity names bl/) and lVslr (Osiris) are given and a heron is depicted.
So much then for the celestial bodies south of the plane of the ecliptic (those of the decanal belt) and the bodies which in their motions intersect the plane of the ecliptic Cthe planets). All of the decanal and planetary material ordinarily occupies one grand southern panel. In addition, many of the monuments include in a northern panel a group of constellations oriented about the Big Dipper. These are usually called the "Northern Constellations: though the changing arrangements of these constellations and their accompanying deities from monument to monument makes their identification (except for the Big Dipper) extremely difficult if not impossible. Hence without II sure identification of these constellations, we cannot assert that all of them are necessarily circumpolar. as is usually said. though I suspect that they are since the Egyptians conventionally distinguish two groups of stars, namely the Imperishable stars, which are the circumpolar stars that do not set, and the Unwearying Stars, which are the decans and planets (see Volume One, Index of

Proper Names. under 'stars') and this is just the
distinction that seems to be made in the northern and southern panels of the celestial diagram. On each side of tbe northern constellations is a register of panels which contains protective deities of
the days of the month with disks on their heads. beginning on the right side with Isis (sometimes), the four sons of Horus. and four more protective day-deities. and on the left side as many as ten or eleven other protective day-deities. We owe to Brugsch the discovery of the origins of the assignment
of these day-gods.OJ Below the northern constellations we occasionally rind a depiction of Thoth as the cynocephalic baboon, and we have already discussed its significance on the Ramesseum astronomical ceiling and on water clocks (see notes 21 and 84). Flanking Thoth the standard diagram (beginning on the [ert side of Thoth) includes panels for the twelve months showing the deity of each month fadng the king. So much then for a generalized account of the so-called celestial diagram. Now we should look briefly at two specific monuments, which are described in greater detail in Documents 11I.3. and lIlA.
The Ceiling of the Secret Tomb of Senmut
The oldest monument134 that includes enough of the celestial diagram to allow us to get a good sense of the whole is contained on the ceiling of the tomb of Senmut CTheban tomb no. 353).135 This sO'called ·secret: unfinished and empty tomb of Senmut was
discovered near the entrance of the temple of Hatshepsut during the excavations of the Metropolitan
Museum in western Thebes in 1925-1927.136 It is, of

Presumably it remained unCinisbed bttause Senmut. who supervised the building of Hatsbepsut's temple and apparently had long and close service ·on the queen's right hand: fell out of favor with his queen.
One of the most interesting features of the tomb is a sketch of Senmut on the .....all of the stairway (clIding to the first chamber (see Fig. 111.63), Next to the sketch we read ·Overseer of the Estate of Amun. Senmul: But it is the astronomical ceiling of the chamber al the bottom of the third flight of stairs that principally concerns us (see Fig. IlIA and Document

the decans of the Scnmut ceiling by Neugebauer and Parker resulted in their reconstruction of the original thirty-six decaos (one of which is missing in the Scnmut ceiling), and most importantly in the straightening out of the confusion in the decans associated with Orion (mentioned in more detail in
Document JII.3).I38 The reader will notice in Fig. 111.4. top. that the decan names have stars as tbeir determinlltives. For example. in the nrst column (starting from the right) the name of the first dccan (tpy-C knmtJ has onc star as a determinative. This is
followed by the names of the gods associated with the decam Hapy and fmseti which are directly followed by two stars. Then in the second column at top appears the third deean (lJry tJpcI knmtJ with the second decan
(knmt) below it. each decan followed by a star. Below them the name Isis appears and below it. covering both columns in a descending line. appear five stars plus a sixth one below in column 2, and considerably below them near the bottom of the two columns is a descending line of five more stars. These star groups apparently indicate some general constellation embracing all three of the decans connected with Immt. I leave the details of the remaining columns of regular decans to the considerations found in Document 111.3. except to note that at the bottom of several columns we see what are apparently grand constellations with pictorial representations and accompanying lines of stars. Thus under columns 7-12 is depicted the Ship. 14-16 the Sheep. 21-23 the Egg (bul considerably above Ihe line of the other grand depictions), 24-28 Orion in a boal, and 29 Isis in a boal. with a feathered crown surmounted by a disk. She represents Sothis. whose name here. as often in the decan lists. is written at the

top of the column as Isis-Sothis (Ist-spdtJ. The ultimate origin of the decan list of this ceiling certainly lies in the decans arranged in some diagonal star clock. This is shown by the fact that. beginning with column 7. a horizontal line is drawn all the way up to the 29th column and each of the columns so underlined contains a successive 12th hour decan from a diagonal star clock. This line then represents the bottom line of a star clock. The next column (col. 30l in the southern panel following those containing the main decans is devoted to the planet Jupiter. and we read in the hieroglyphics "Horus who bounds the two hmds'is his name" followed
by a disordered phrase which probably should be rendered "southern star of the sky: Below is the falcon-headed Horus in a boat and bearing a star on his head. The column next to Jupiter is that of Saturn. where we read "Horus bull of the sky is his name:
followed by a disordered epithet. which should probably read 'the eastern star which crosses the sky: Once more the falcon-headed Horus with a star on his head is depicted in a boat at the bottom of the column. A column devoted to Mars often follows in other monuments (see Fig. 1ll.65b and my discussion of the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I below). In the Scnmut
tomb it is omitted. Following the exterior planets are six of the 12 triangle decans in five columns. I mention only the first decan (f/wyJ. which has at the bottom of the column two tOrloises. and the second decan (nsrwJ.

columns of Venus a heron with a star on its head is pictured. Turning to the northern panel of the Senmut ceiling (Fig. 111.4 bottom) we should first concentrate on the
northern constellations in the middle of the panel (cr. Fig. 111.66>, those usulIlly designated as the circumpolar constellations. At the top center we find the Big Dipper or Great Bear represented here as II bull with a recognizable bull's head joined to a curious ovoidal body, with two short protruding legs llnd II tail of three stars. the last being a red encircled dot hom which two diverging vertical lines extend to the bottom of the panel (see Fig. 111.66 [0]).

its handle represent the basic points of the foreleg).

meridian were certainly made by Egyptians when Eta and then Zeta Ursae Majoris were
the nearest of the bright circumpolar stars. The transit staff in Berlin [see my Figs. 1II.20a and 1II.20b] is of relatively recent date, but the plumb-line holder which apparently belongs to it looks like a distant descendant of the 」イッウウセウィ。、ッキ ruler [i.e.. shadow clock] which beaTs the name of Thutmose [Tuthmosisl JJl [and is described above in my account of shadow clocks];...

Continuing our perusal of the constellations that accompany Meskhetyu at the center of the northern panel of the Senmut ceiling (Figs. 111.4, bouom, and 111.66, [0]). note that there are seven rigures that surely represent constellations of stars: [l1 Serket (the scorpion goddess above Meskhetyu and looking down on Meskbetyu and the other figures), [21 Anu (a falcon-headed god below and facing Meskhetyu. with arms extended and holding a cord or spear directed at and touching Meskhetyu), [3] lsis-Djamet (the hippopotamus goddess-with a crocodile on her

The last constellation, [7] Saq (another crocodile with a curved tail, located at the top of the panel, to the left of Serqet). As the result of the size of the two flanking rows of the monthly circles, there is considerable space between the group at the top
comprising Meskhetyu and Figures m. (2), and (7) and
the group at the bottom including (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7a). One supposes that the totality of Figures representing the northern constellations in its original form was a much more compact group, and indeed Neugebauer and Parker have attempted to reconstruct ....hat they believed to have been the original, more tightly knit grouping (see Fig. 111.66>' As one examines the various extant versions of the celestial diagram given by Neugebauer and Parker in the third volume of their Egyptian Astronomical Texts, Chapter IV, and my remarks in Documents 111.3 and 111.4 below, it is evident that there was considerable

variation in the arrangement of the northern constellations in their depictions on the sundry astronomical monuments (c.g.. compare Fig. 111.66 with Figs. 111.67-69»)41 Hence. as in the case of decans given on the southern panel. it is exceedingly difficult (if not impossible) to identify the Egyptian constellations exactly with modern depictions. except, of course, for the certain identi£ication of Meskhetyu with the Big Dipper. Still. the identifications proposed by Pogo are
reasonable. if not certain.142
The slar surrounded by a circle on the Senmut ceiling corresponds, obviously. to the early recognizable bright staT. Zeta Ursae Majoris-the one with the conspicuous companion. The scorpion goddess Selqet (Scrqed stands behind the bull Meskheti in such a way that it seems 。セ if she were trying to grasp the two cords stretched from the culminating star Zeta-over the invisible pole-down to the northern horizon.... By 1500 B,C•• the celestial pole was closer to Ursa Minor than to Ursa Majorl culminations of Beta Ursae Minoris could be -and possibly were- used for the

hippopotamus rests on the "dipper" of Ursa Minor. which is just east of the meridian with
our polaris near the horizon of Thebes. The hand of the hippopotamus always rests, in later representations. on an object which is wider at the lop than at the boltom [j,e.• a mooring post]; the reins always lead to that support of the hippopotamus in more or less
fancy curves-a tradition blindly followed by craftsmen who could not be expected to realize that in the dim past a vertical line joined Zeta or even Eta Ursae Majoris, when they culminated, with Ursa Minor near the horizon. The identification of the circumpolar constellations...which appear west of the meridian. near the horizon. is father difficult. The stars Omicron and 23 Ursae Majoris may have something to do with the crocodile, and the stars Lambda-Kappa-Alpha Drllconis, with the man facing the crocodile (his left hand, his head, and his right hand respectively), The identification of the falcon-headed god Anu
with Cygnus argued by Wainwright143 seems unlikely because of the considerable distance of Cygnus from the
Big Dipper (cL Fig, 1II,64a and Fig, 1II.70a),144 J suspect that the same reasoning puts into doubt some of the identifications of Herbert Chat ley, which he calls "probable"; the Hippopotamus with Bootes (the Guardsman), Hercules, Lyra, as well as Dracol the
crocodile and accompanying god or man with Cassiopeia and Perseus; the Lion with Auriga (to which he appends a "1"); and the Goddess Serqet with Coma Berenice

Aleida Biegel to establish the stars that make up these and other constellations in the Egyptian celestial diagram146 have been shown by Pogo. in a severe
review of her dissertation, to be quite: fallacious and inadequatc:.147
Not much more need be said in this brief account of the celestial diagram as represented on the Senmut
ceiling. I have mentioned the twelve circles
surmounted by month names that appear on each side of the northern constellations. They proceed in the first row from right to left and then in the second row from left to right. Hence the four circles at the top right refer to the four months of the season Inundation. the two at the top left and the two beloW' them on the leFt refer to the season of Peter. and the four circles on the right to the season of Shemu. Each circle is divided into 24 unidentified sectors. Since the time of the first descriptions of the tomb the sectors have been thought to mark in some fashion the 24 hours of the day and night periods, but there have not been any satisfactory
explanations as to how they marked the hours.148 Perhaps the sectors were meant to carry two sets of 12-hour meridian or other transits of bright stars, as in the Ramesside transit clocks, which we have seen probably originated at least as early as the time of Senmut in the 18th dynasty. If so. then each circle was meant to contain the star-transits marking the 12 nighttime hours of the rirst day of the month in one half the circle and the star-transits marking those SlIme hours of the 16th day of the month in the other half of the circle.

The Vaulted Ceiling of Hall K in Seti I"s Tomb. We have talcen some pains to describe the Senmut ceiling because it represents an early and influential family of the Egyptian celestial diagram. A few words can be added concerning another inrluential depiction of that diagram found in the ceiling of hall K in the tomb
of $eli I 0306-1290 B.c.> in the Valley of Kings in Western Thebes (see Document iliA for 8 more detailed account), The sepulchral hall with the whole
astronomical ceiling is shown in Fig. 111.658. It is evident that the northern and southern panels (often designated as the Eastern and Western Parts; see Document lilA belo.....) are separated by an empty band in the center. Let us look first at the decan list of the southern panel (see Fig. III.65b). Neugebauer and Parker call it "the prototype for the third family of
rising decans:l49 The list includes 39 decans, but three of them appear to be triangle decans that have strayed out of position, Sometimes the columns are ..... idened to include more than one decan (e.g.• columns 11, 12, 20. and 22). no doubt because the decans included are part of a larger constellation <the prime example being the various decans in column 22 that are a part of the constellation of Sah. i.e., Orion>' As in the Senmut list mistakenly omitted decans are occasionally inserted belo..... the top decan (or decans) in a column (see columns 11, 14. 20, and 22).

Senmu! ceiling. as Pogo has remarked:15O As stated before, the orientation of the southern panel [on the Senrnut ceiling] is such that the person in Ihe tomb looking at it has to lift his hcad and face north. not south. The list of Ihe dccans preceding the Sah-Sepdct [Orion-Sirius] group occupies. therefore. the castern par[ of the southern panel. whereas the planets and constellations which follow Sepdct in the traditional arrangement are listed in the western parl. The southern strip of the Ramesseum. like the southern panel of Scnmut. must be read. in the temple [see Fig. 1lJ.2l. by
a person facing north. On the ceiling of Set J. on the other hand. the orientation of the southern panel is astronomically correct. so that Orion precedes Sirius in the westward
motion of the southern sky. The irrational orientation of the southern panel has caused some confusion in the representation of Sah [Orion] on the ceilings of Scnmut and of the Ramesseum, both of which obviously follow the same tradition. On the ceiling of Seli I - which reflects another tradition - Osiris-Sah. participating in the nightly westward motion of the sky. is running away from Isis-Scpdet; he turns his head eastward to look at the pursuing goddessl the bow of her boat is almost ramming the

stern of his. With the reversed orientation of the southern panel [in the Senmut traditionl, Orion. the most conspicuous constellation of
the southern sky, appeared to be moving eastward. i.e., in the wrong direction; to save the situation, Orion was turned around-within or with his boat. The Senmut and the
Ramesseum ceilings represent Orion in this 'reversed' position. adapted to their orientation of the southern panel: the Senmut draftsman made the bows and the sterns look alike; in the Ramesseum. the bow of Orion's boat approaches the bow of the boat of the Sirius-goddess; the element of pursuit is lost in both cases; instead of looking back at the bright star behind him. the god is turning his head away from the goddess. Mythologically. both the Senmut-Ramesseum and the $eti traditions may be equally valuable; astronomically. the $eti representation is far more satisfactory. The first 25 columns (starting from the right) are divided into three registers and the last 10 into 4 registers. In the decanal columns. the names of the decans are included in the first register; stars indicating (but not always accurately) the number of decans in a column are in the second register; and the names and depictions of most of the patron deities of the decans (having anthropomorphic bodies and a mixture of human and animal heads) are in the third register. There is considerable crowding of the figures of the gods and goddesses so that some of the decans are not represented and some of the figures do not represent accurately the decan given above it. The large figures

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
of constellations mentioned in our description of the southern panel of the Senmut ceiling are mostly present on the Seli ceiling, except for the figure of the sheep (under columns 144 16 in the Senmut list) and the figure of the two tortoises under the triangle decan 5/wy (in column 32 of the Senmut list). One other diHerence in the two lists is the inclusion in column 26 of the $eli list of the planet Mars ("easlern star of the sky, his name is Horus of the Horizonl he travels backwards [j.e.• is in retrograde rnotionJ")ISI, with the depiction of the ヲXャ」ッョセィ・X、・、 god in 8 bark, while this planet is missing from the Senmut panel. Hence $etrs list includes all five of the easily visible planets, Jupiter, Saturn. and Mars before the six triangle decans and
Mercury and Venus after them.J52 The reconstructed list of triangle decans on the Seti ceiling is the same as that of Senmut. Finally, in regard to the southern panel. there is considerable divergency in the number and arrangement of stars that accompany the main 36 decans. As in the case of the Senmut ceiling. it is extremely difficult to identify with any certainty the decans listed on the Seti ceiling, other than those connected with Orion and Sirius at the end of the list, and even those surely connected with Orion are not identifiable with specific stars in the Orion constellation.153 A few words remain to be added concerning the northern panel on the Seli ceiling (see Fig. 1II.65b. bottom, and especially Fig. 111.69). Among the
differences in the northern constellations of the Seti ceiling from those on the Senmut ceiling. are the folloWing: (I) Meskhetyu, the constellation of the Great Bear. is now represented by a complete bull striding on a platform; (2) An (written as An rather than as Anti).

the falcon-headed god, appears to be supporting the bulrs platform: (3) behind the bull a Man (or god) with
a disk on his head has been added: he holds reins that connect the bull with a mooring post resting on the bottom of the figure; (4) in front of the bull a falcon has been added; (5) both paws of the Hippopotamus
appear to be on the mooring post; there are seven circles (slars) running down the 1·lippo·s extended headdress; (6) the crocodile on the back of the Hippo here is much larger than it is on the Scnmut ceiling; (7)
the other crocodile on the lert is more horizontal: as before. the crocodile lunges at Man (78) in whose outline are 10 circles (stars); the Lion (8) above the crocodile is almost completely outlined by stars; (9) there is only one depiction of the crocodile with a
curved tail and it is locatcd in front of the Lion and acts as a determinative for its namc; (10) the scorpion goddess Scrqet is at the top left rather than above the bull; and all of the figures except the crocodile on the back of the Hippo, the crocodilc on the bottom lert, and the Falcon, have circles within them representing the stars on the basis of which the constellations were imagined: those in the rigures> with anthropomorphic
bodies being more numerous than those in the figures with animal bodies (see the use of the circles as stellar connecting points for the construction of the constellations by Biegel mentioned in notes 146 and 14n I ignore once more the deities nanking the northern constellations on the northern panel of the Seti ceiling since they do not seem to have any astronomical significance. Finally we can note that there is no register on the 5cti ceiling that includes the months of the year and their deities.

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SCIENCE
Egyptian Zodiacs One last kind of astronomical decoration on monuments (temples. coffins. and tombs) needs to be treated, Egyptian zodiacs. all of which originated in the Greco-Roman period. The earliest known Egyptian zodiac (the so-called una A zodiac) was 8 rectangular one hom the temple of Khoum 2 1/2 miles northwest of Esna, that is. from the part of the temple originating in the reigns of Ptolemy III-V. Hence it dated from about 200 D.C. That temple was destroyed in 1843 to build a canal and the zodiac disappeared along with it. But the zodiac is still preserved in a plate from the Description
de iGセァケーエ・ (see Document 111.17 and Figs. 111.758 and
1II.75bJ.
The pictorial representations of the zodiacal signs in the Egyptian zodiacs (though nol their full range of Hellenistic additions) were surely of ultimate Babylonian origin. This is true of both the early rectangular form of the zodiacs and of the round zodiacs where the signs constitute a circular belt (as in the Dendera B zodiac presented in Document 111.17 and depicted in Figs. JII.76a and 1II.76b). Though it is tempting to think that the Egyptian round zodiacs
represented the divisions of the zodiac in terms of degrees (as some of the earlier investigators seem to have assumed). it is evident from the analysis of the celestial diagrams I discussed above that there was no use of a system of degrees in ancient Egypt to measure celestial arcs. The Egyptian zodiacs not only included the signs of the zodiac but the old hour decans. the planets. and other Egyptian stars or constellations as well (like the Big Dipper and the Hippopotamus). By the time of the preparation of these zodiacs. the risings

or transits of decans were probably no longer used to mark the hours of the night. In the earliest Egyptian zodiac. the rectangular zodiac Esoa A mentioned above (Fig. 1II.75a) and also in the rectangular zodiac in the ceiling of the outer hypostyle hall at Dendera (designated as Dendera E), the decens for the most part
seemed to be associated with or represented divisions of the areas assigned to the zodiacal figures. each sign being divided into three decans (except in a few cases of four decans), which. when absorbed in Greek and Roman zodiacs. were merely the names of the three IO-degree divisions of each of the zodiacal signs. Hence. in this new form the decans continued to playa part in Ihc later astrology of Greece, Rome. India, Islam.
and medieval and Renaissance Europe.54 A more detailed examination of the Egyptian elements in these zodiacs is given in Document IlI.l7 below. We can simply note here that these elements. and particularly the decans. were drawn primarily from two families of the celestial diagram, those called by
Neugebauer and Parker "the Seti I B· and the "Tanis· families and a few constellations from those we have discussed as northern constellations on astronomical ceilings. And indeed the earliest complete Greek version of decanal names, that of Hephaestion of Thebes (fourth century A.DJ. appears to have been
chosen exclusively from the Seli I B and Tanis families (see Fig. 1I1.103).
Conclusion So far I have discussed the principal Egyptian texts and monuments bearing on aSlronomy. The reader may have been conscious of the fact that almost all of the documents have been anonymous. A spectacular

exception was the tract on the waterc10ck composed by one Amenemhet and dedicated to Amenhotep 1 (see Document 111.15), Another interesting example is given below as Document 111.18. where in an inscription on his statue (ca. 2nd century. B.CJ an astronomer and snake charmer named Harkhebi enumerated his astronomical, calendrical. and timc·telling activities, including the observation of the stars and announcements of their risings and settings. his purification on the days when the deean Akh rose helillcally beside Venus. his observations of other helillclil risings. lind particularly his foretelling of the heliacal rising of Sirius at the beginning of the [civil] ycar. and so on. These lire essentially the activities we have described in this volume. and the documents that now follow and constitute· the major part of this volume will throw further light on them.
It should be clear from my summary account that the ancient Egyptian documents do not employ any kinematic models. whether treated geometrically or arithmetically. However they did use tabulated lists of star risings and transits (as is revealed clearly in Documents IlI.II. 11I.12. and IlI.14). all tied to their efforts to measure time by means of the apparent motions of celestial bodies, On more than one occasion in this chapter. I have remarked on the absence in early Egyptian astronomy of the use of degrees. minutes. and seconds to quantify angles or arcs. though slopes were copiously used in the construction of buildings. water clocks and shadow clocks; such slopes were measured by linear ratios,1S5 And obviously. in the above mentioned tables for hour charts. right ascension was being approximated in terms of hours (though we are not completely sure how
-128



CALENDARS, CLOCKS, ASTRONOMY
precisely), So far as I can determine, there were no standard. quantitative evaluations of declimltions given in the tables. But of course in determining meridian transits the observers were keeping track of the maximum height of the transiting stars each night
throughout the ycar. Finally. the reader should realize that by the time of the Ptolemaic and Roman occupations of Egypt there were numerous other late Hellenistic and Roman astronomical and astrological texts which. though including some Egyptian elements, are not discussed in my volume. This is because they were primarily motivated by Greele and Roman astronomy or astrology (e.g.. documents such as planetary tables consisting of the dates of entry of planets into zodiacal signs). I consider them outside the limits of my account of ancient Egyptian astronomy, but the reader can find expert treatment of such texts, or guidance to them, in the last chapter of Volume Three of Neugebauer's and
Parker's Egyptian Astronomical Texts. 56
