# Index for Tom van Bakel – In the Indus Valley and the Ancient Near East Soma like drinks were drunk on many occasions.pdf

In both the Indus Valley Civilization and the Ancient Near East Cultures, a Soma-like drink was drunk on many, many occasions
In the Indus Valley and in the kingdoms of the Ancient Near East, the poison of snakes and scorpions was used to make a drink with which one could obtain an ‘expanded consciousness’. From different images painted on bowls and dishes and from Rigveda texts it can be concluded that this poison was not drunk pure, but it was mixed with milk and curds, with meat and barley brew and also with a sweetener.
When we study the seals it becomes clear that this drink was drunk on many occasions: at the sowing and harvesting of barley, at the appointment of a scribe, at a marriage and at the birth of a child: apparently all these events were participated with, as they say, ‘elated hearts’.
Number 1 Number 2
I start this essay with these beautiful glasses: the goblet on the left is decorated with grape vines and the crystal glass on the right is engraved with a barley decoration. It is evident that these decorations tell us what is being drunk from these glasses: wine from the vinedecorated goblet and beer from the barley-decorated glass.
Number 3
The same goes for this chalice made in Bactria some 5,000 years ago. The outside is decorated with 12 scorpions and in this essay I argue that these carvings suggest that poison from these small animals is drunk from this vessel.



Number 4
When studying the seals it is striking that often scorpions are carved on them, as can be seen on this imprint of an cylinder seal made in Archaic Persia. Here two stylized scorpions creep side by side. The upwardly rising one having a prominent eye and this is special, because the picture below shows that this is not self-evident at all, as a scorpion has nothing there, no head and no eye.
Number 5
This one eye above the imprint scorpion should therefore be taken as a sign, because that single eye suggests that this scorpion is linked to Haoma (which is similar to Soma), as from the Rigveda it can be concluded that Soma is a personality, who can see far and is a seer and thus must have at least one eye:
Rigveda nr 9-12
Far-sighted Soma, Sage and Seer, is worshipped in the central point Of heaven, the straining-cloth of wool.



Number 6
On this bowl, which was made in Balochistan between 3800-2300 BCE, we see the same phenomenon: a scorpion with a single eye in the middle of its body, there, where there is nothing to see in reality.
Number 7
It so happens that in the Rigveda texts Soma is often described as drops, but in the next hymn this drop turns out to be a bull whose eye is our protector:
Rigveda hymn nr 9-89
King, he hath clothed him in the robe of rivers, mounted the straightest-going ship of Order. Sped by the Hawk the drop hath waxed in waters: the father drains it, drains the Father's offspring. They come to him, red, tawny, Lord of Heaven, the watchful Guardian of the meath, the Lion. First, Hero in the fight, he seeks the cattle, and with his eye the Steer is our protector.
In another hymn Soma has been likened to a bird:
Rigveda hymn nr 9-3
Here present this Immortal God flies, like a bird upon her wings, To settle in the vats of wood.
So in the scene above, a single Soma drop is pictured below. It is clear that it resembles both the eye of the guinea fowl and the eye of the zebu: it should come as no surprise that this drink is called ‘many-eyed’:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-26
Him, green, beloved, many eyed, the Sisters with prosing stones Send down to ridges of the sieve. O Pavamana, Indu, priests hurry thee on to Indra, thee Who aidest song and cheerest him.



Number 8
I show you another imprint on which a scorpion is depicted, this time with a number of 'drops' cut out around it. Again, these ‘drops’ suggest that the scorpion is related to Haoma, in other words: that the scorpion's poison is the main ingredient of this ritual drink.
Number 9
This mythical animal is a scorpion and a snake in one. There are many round, even holes cut into the body. These holes symbolize Haoma or Soma drops which in turn resemble eyes. This means nothing other than that this mythical creature has many eyes:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-65
Sing forth your songs, as Vyasva sang, to Soma Pavamana, to,
The Mighty One with thousand eyes;
With its many eyes, this animal obviously sees everything.



Number 10
When we now look at these faces of statues from a temple at Tell Asmar, the special large round eyes stand out, all of which resemble the ‘eyes’ on the previous scorpion/snake. It seems as if these images depict people who, under the influence of Haoma or Soma, ‘see the light':
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-48
That each may see the light, the Bird brought us the guard of Law, the Friend Of all, the speeder through the air.
Number 11
We continue with this beautiful chalice on which a scorpion crawls on the trunk of a palm tree and a sheep's head is carved on the handle. From some Rigveda hymns we can conclude that the scorpion, the palm tree and the sheep are used to make Soma alias Haoma drinks. First of all, the poison is extracted from the scorpion. Next this poison is sweetened with the dates of the palm tree. Then it is mixed with milk, curd and meat from the sheep and finally it is filtered through the wool of the same sheep.



Number 12
On the basis of this and the next four imprints, which have many similarities, we will describe step by step the meaning of the different figures depicted on them.
We start with the bird situated between the two human figures. This animal symbolizes the idea of ‘fate’, because the Sumerian word for bird is ‘nam’ which also means fate or destiny.
http://www.goldenageproject.org.uk/969.php
This means that the person in the middle, sitting on a throne and holding a cup, determines the destiny of the person on the far left, as in a praise poem Enlil decrees a destiny for Šulgi:
A praise poem of Šulgi
......, the king ....... Enlil decrees a destiny for Šulgi: ‘O king, I will decree a destiny for you, I will
decree a good destiny for you! O Šulgi, I will decree a destiny for you, I will decree a good destiny
for you! I will decree heroism as your destiny! I will decree long-lasting office as ruler and king as
your destiny! May you raise your head in terrifying splendour! May no man stand his ground before your fierce gaze! May your royal crown shine radiantly! May your sceptre be a princely sceptre, and may its shining branches provide shade!
Number 13
A scorpion is depicted on the top right of this imprint, the poison of this arachnid serves as the key ingredient for the Haoma or Soma drink. It is clear that the sitting god is drinking the mind-altering liquid, for he must determine the fate of the man who opposes him with a supposedly elated heart. Like Enki and Ninmah, after drinking, decided the fate of the people they created from clay:
Enki and Ninmaḫ Enki ...... brought joy to their heart. He set a feast for his mother Namma and for Ninmaḫ. All the princely birth-goddesses (?) ...... ate delicate reed (?) and bread. An, Enlil, and Lord Nudimmud
roasted holy kids. All the senior gods praised him: ‘O lord of wide understanding, who is as wise as you? Enki, the great lord, who can equal your actions? Like a corporeal father, you are the one who has the me of deciding destinies, in fact you are the me.’ Enki and Ninmaḫ drank beer, their hearts became elated, and then Ninmaḫ said to Enki: ‘Man's body can be either good or bad and whether I make a fate good or bad depends on my will.’ Enki answered Ninmaḫ: ‘I will counterbalance
whatever fate -- good or bad -- you happen to decide.’.



Number 14
The carving in the frame is the Sumerian 'XE' sign:
XE The Sumerian sign (Jaritz #669) reads še (for *ši), 'barley', and 'grain, seed'; the proper word for 'grain, seed' (SE-?A) is discussed above under SE.
Among others it means ‘barely’. It is carved on the seal because according to the Rigveda hymn nr. 3-42 this grain is mingled with Soma:
Rigveda hymn nr. 3-42 Mingled with barley and with milk.
Number 15
Then Soma is blended with milk and curds which is obviously obtained from the Urial sheep:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-103
Blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the sheep. The Gold-hued, purified, makes him three seats for rest.
Number 16
Next, Soma drops have been effused in streams of meat of the same sheep:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-23
Swift Soma drops have been effused in streams of meath, the gladdening drink,
For sacred lore of every kind.
Finally, the wool of this sheep is used to purify the drink:
Rig Veda hymn nr. 9-101 Soma upon the ox's skin through the sheep's wool flows purified.



Number 17
Now we are able to understand this imprint as well as the next one.
o Here we see a sheep, three spouted pots and a number of droplets of which one has
been worked out as an eye. o That Soma eye and the Soma droplets suggest that these pots are filled with Soma.
o This drink may have been mixed with the milk, curd and meat of the sheep and purified
by means of its wool.
Everything is displayed here in front of two doors, for according to the Rigveda hymn no. 9102, with radiant eyes Soma unbar the stall of heaven:
Rigveda hymn nr 9-102
With wisdom and with radiant eyes unbar to us the stall of heaven,
Speeding at solemn rite the plan of Holy Law.
The point is that I believe that the statement: 'unbar the stall of heaven' or ‘the doors of wealth’ are metaphors for obtaining an 'expanded consciousness':
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-45
We balm thee, red of hue, with milk to fit thee for the rapturous joy:
Unbar for us the doors of wealth.
Number 18
On the right side of this imprint we see a recipe for the Soma drink: the poison of the scorpions and the snake (with a Soma eye) is mixed with milk, curd and meat of the sheep and purified with its wool. We may then assume that the four spouted pots are filled with this Haoma or Soma drink. I think this print then suggests that with this ritual drink the doors on the left are opened. The surprising thing is that in the Epic of Gilgamesh we see something similar, because here we read that two scorpion-beings open the Gate for Gilgamesh:
Now! Open the Gate!’
The scorpion-being spoke to Gilgamesh, saying: ‘Go on, Gilgamesh, fear not! The Mashu mountains I give to you freely (!), the mountains, the ranges, you may traverse ...
Then Gilgamesh journeyed along the Road of the Sun:
As soon as Gilgamesh heard this he heeded the utterances of the scorpion-being.
Along the Road of the Sun L he journeyed-- one league he traveled ...,
dense was the darkness, light there was none.
The Epic of Gilgamesh Translated by Maureen Gallery Kovacs



Number 19
Here we see two seated people drinking from a large jar through a tube. The scorpion suggests that its poison is mixed in the drink these two individuals are drinking.
Rigveda hymn nr. 8-48
On all sides,. Soma, thou art our life-giver: aim of all eyes, light-finder, come within us.
Indu, of one accord with thy protections both from behind and from before preserve us.
Number 20
The same applies to this imprint: this scorpion suggests that the drink these two figures drink through a tube is mixed with the poison of this little animal.
Rigveda hymn nr. 7-91.
So far as native power and strength permit you, so far as men behold whose eyes have vision, O ye pure-drinkers, drink with us pure Soma: sit on this sacred grass, Indra and Vayu.
Number 21
This imprint is divided horizontally by wavy band. Above this band sits a figure drinking through tube from a pot. The scorpion next to him suggests that that poison of this small animal is the key ingredient of this drink. The eagle below may represent Haoma alias Soma, because it is mentioned ‘a heavenly Eagle’ in the next verse of the Rigveda hymn nr. 9-97:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-97
Pouring out streams at the Gods' feast with service, thou, Soma, lookest down, a heavenly Eagle. Enter the Soma-holding beaker, Indu, and with a roar approach the ray of Sarya.



Number 22
It is quite clear that on this seal from the city of Suza a man and a woman have intercourse. However, it is disconcerting to see that the woman is drinking through a tube from a large vessel at the same time. It turns out this was not unusual, as we can see from a Balbale in which Inanna and Dummuzid drink together and love each other:
A balbale to Inana
'My dearest, my dearest, my dearest, my darling, my darling, my honey of her own mother, my sappy vine, my honey-sweet, my honey-mouthed of her mother!' 'The gazing of your eyes is pleasant to me; come my beloved sister. The speaking of your mouth is pleasant to me, my honey-mouthed of her mother. The kissing of your lips is pleasant to me; come my beloved sister.'
'My sister, the beer of your barley is good, my honey-mouthed of her mother. The ale of your beer
bread is good; come my beloved sister. In the house, your luxuriance ......, my honey-mouthed of her mother. My sister, your luxuriance ......, my beloved ....... Your house ...... a storehouse, my honeymouthed of her mother. You princess, my .......'
'For as long as you live, as long as you live, you shall take an oath for me, brother of the countryside, for as long as you live you shall take an oath for me. You shall take an oath for me that you will not touch another. You shall take an oath for me that you will not ...... your head on anyone else.' 'My one who wears the ...... niĝlam garment, my beloved, man of my heart! I shall impose an oath ...... on you, my brother of the beautiful eyes. My brother, I shall impose an oath on you, my brother of the beautiful eyes.' Etc, etc.
Number 23
And also on this terracotta plaque from Babylon, a man and a woman have united with each other and the woman drinks simultaneously through a tube from a large vessel. So it is clear that a huge amount of liquor is consumed during the act of love.



Number 24
Barrel
On this imprint, two people make love on a couch. Next to it is a barrel with drinking tubes, which obviously suggests that these two people have drunk large amounts of juice. Underneath the bench lies a scorpion, which suggests that the barrel is filled with Haoma or Soma, based on the poison of this arachnid. The child on the left was born from the act of love. Nevertheless the influence of the Soma drink was apparently so great that it was asked to give offspring, so, Soma gave this child:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-59
Flow onward, Soma, winning kine, and steeds, and all that gives delight: Bring hither wealth with progeny.
Number 25
In this drawing we again see two people making love on a couch. And just like on the previous imprint there is a scorpion under this couch, suggesting that these two people drank a drink in which the poison of this arachnid was mixed. The young man on the right emerged from this act of love, but the significance of the Soma drink was apparently so great that it was assumed that this drink brought this young man:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-66
Soma, as Sura, bring us food, win offspring of our bodies: we
Elect thee for our friendship, we elect thee for companionship.

h ttp://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
It is necessary that we draw our attention to this Andrew cross. In ancient Sumer, it was a sign that had the following meanings: ‘first and foremost, pre-eminent; father; male, virile; brother'. Nevertheless on the next drawing it indicates the mating act:
Number 26
This funny drawing shows a couple who have their legs intertwined: together they form an Andrew cross, which of course suggests that the couple has united. The scorpion on the right suggests that this happens under the influence of a Soma drink based on the poison of this animal. Because of its influence this drink it is asked for heroic sons:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-9
Give, Pavamana, high renown, give kine and steeds and hero sons: Win for us wisdom, win the light.
Number 27
These are the front and back of a round stamp. On the left we see an Andrew cross, which indicates the union of a couple. This union is fruitful, for on the right we see that the woman spreads her legs to give birth to a child about nine months later. So the left side indicates the begetting of a child and the right side indicates his birth.



Number 28
We continue this essay with this imprint which is divided into two registers. In the one at the top we see the Andreas cross on the right, which symbolizes the mating act. In addition, a woman spreads her legs to give birth to a child. This is a story told in many different ways on many seals. The scorpion below suggests that its poison was drunk on the wedding night. And the swastika with its 12 short lines suggests that this scorpion is related to the goddess Ishara.
Number 29
Here is a reconstruction drawing of a bowl based on only one shard. This drawing shows eight scorpions and four female figures. Ishara turns out to be the goddess of these scorpions. In the drawing, this goddess is depicted four times as a naked woman and eight times as a scorpion, which together may symbolize the twelve months. When a goddess is depicted in full armour she is militant, but when she is depicted naked she is fertile and brings forth. The above drawing therefore suggests that the naked Iskhara brings forth that which is characteristic of the every season.
In later periods, for example on boundary stones (kudurru) Ishara was instead symbolically represented by the scorpion. Neither the reason behind attribution of either symbol to her nor why the change from bashmu to scorpion occurred are known. Like her, scorpions were associated with marriage in Mesopotamian culture. In Babylonian astronomy, she was associated with the 'scorpion star' (mulgir-tab). As a love goddess, Ishara could also be associated with cannabis.

Number 30
Bowl
In this imprint, a woman is about to give birth to a child. It is shocking to see a scorpion under the sofa here. Which means that this woman drank a drink in which the poison of a scorpion was mixed, before she gave birth to a child. This Soma drink gave the child:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-74
The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Gods enjoy.
Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny.
Number 31
This imprint demonstrates that a scorpion symbolizes fertility: the stinger of the scorpion is a phallic symbol whereas the two scissors are birth-giving symbols: the stinger is placed between the two vulvas indicating that it inseminates them.
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-86
These are thy generations of celestial seed thou art the Sovran Lord of all the world of life. This universe, O Pavamana, owns thy sway; thou, Indu, art the first establisher of Law.
The scissors may give birth to the created children:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-9
Give, Pavamana, high renown, give kine and steeds and hero sons:
Win for us wisdom, win the light.



Number 32
Once again: the stinger of the scorpion is a phallic symbol and symbolizes creation. The two scissors may symbolize childbirth and thus the scorpion may be the father as well as the mother of the depicted child who is standing on the right.
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-61
O Soma, being purified, bring us from all sides,-for thou canst,Riches and food with hero-sons.
Number 33
This imprint Ninĝirsu (indicated by the dog), Inanna (indicated by the maiden) and Adad (indicated by the raven) are ploughing. At the left on top is a scorpion, which suggests that before plowing the three deities drank a drink in which the poison of the scorpion was mixed. Because they have drunk this drink, they can plow with ‘elated hearts’.
In ‘The song of the ploughing oxen’ it is the farmer does have a vision, or an expanded consciousness:
The song of the ploughing oxen: an ululumama to Ninurta
ellu mallu! In the temple he lay down to dream with Nanše. He said good night (?) to Nanše. He had his leather bag filled with bread, he had water poured into his waterskin. She stood by for him ....... The farmer had a vision (?): a young bull was talking ......, ...... tied the feet (?). The farmer said to his mother,’ Bread was put for me in my leather bag, water was poured for me into my waterskin. ...... stood by for me.’



Number 34
This is a fragment of a so-called 'Mace-head' found in ancient Egypt. In the image we see a scorpion above a so-called 'ard', a tool that was used in agriculture. This image suggests that in Egypt people also plowed under the influence of a drink in which the poison of scorpions was mixed.
Number 35
On this imprint we see two gods carrying a pot or a basket with which they transport their harvest. A scorpion is depicted under this pot or basket. This arachnid suggests that harvesting was also done under the influence of its poison: Soma appears to be a powerful god capable of giving food (and progeny):
Rigveda hymn nr 9-23
O Pavamana, bring to us the unsacrificing foeman's wealth,
And give us food with progeny.



Number 36
This is an imprint of nothing but a scorpion and the Sumerian XE sign meaning 'barley', 'grain' and 'seed'.
It will be understood that the scorpion, which is related to the goddess Ishara, is the poison that forms the main ingredient of the Soma drink. But the XE sign is not unambiguous. First, it can symbolize barley with which the poison is mixed:
Rigveda hymn nr. 3-42
Borne hither by thy Stallions, drink, Indra, this juice which we have pressed,
Mingled with barley and with milk.
Second, it can symbolize a grain harvest from which bread is made, since Soma produces food:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-15
Men beautify him in the vats, him worthy to be beautified,
Him who brings forth abundant food.
Third, it can symbolize ‘seed’ or ‘sperm’ because Soma also produces offspring:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-66
Soma, as Sura, bring us food, win offspring of our bodies: we
Elect thee for our friendship, we elect thee for companionship.
I personally think that the XE sign simply suggests all three possibilities.
Number 37
This bowl was made in the Nal period and three scorpions are painted on the top. So, it was also known in Ancient Pakistan that Soma could be made from scorpion poison.



Number 38
A single snake is carved on this bowl, suggesting that the poison of this reptile was mixed in this bowl or drunk from this bowl. Snakes are linked to the Mesopotamian god Ninĝišzida. It is written of him that he is a poisonous serpent and a pure magician:
A balbale to Ninĝišzida
Lord, your mouth is that of { a pure magician } { (1 ms. has instead:) a snake with a great tongue, a magician } { (1 ms. has instead:) a poisonous snake }, Lord Ninĝišzida, ......! Ninĝišzida, your mouth is that of a pure magician, Lord Ninĝišzida, ......! My linen-clad one, when you ......, who can find out your intentions? Ninĝišzida, when you ......, who can find out your intentions? Your holy
word is known to them that know it, but is unknown to them that do not know it. To them that do not know it, to them that do not know it, ....... Ninĝišzida, to them that do not know it, ...... When your great word comes to the earth, you are indeed a { (1 ms. adds:) great } mušḫuš .......
Number 39
This is the imprint of the so-called 'Adam and Eve' seal. The snake and the palm tree provide two ingredients of the Haoma drink: the snake for the poison and the palm tree for the dates with which the drink is sweetened. According to the next text we enjoy Soma with an enlivened Spirit, etc.:
Rigveda hymn nr. 8-48 May we enjoy with an enlivened spirit the juice thou givest, like ancestral riches. O Soma, King, prolong thou our existence as Surya makes the shining days grow longer.



Number 40
On this imprint we see in the center a man standing opposite a god who is seated on a throne:
o We start with the bird situated behind the man. This animal symbolizes the idea of
'fate', because the Sumerian word for bird is 'nam' which also means fate or destiny. o This means that the god, sitting on a throne, determines the destiny of the man
standing in the middle. o The snake, again behind the standing man, suggests this is happening under the
influence of Haoma, which is based on the poison of this reptile. o This means that this event happened with an ‘elated heart’.
o Unfortunately it is not possible what the god tells the man, because the inscription is
incomprehensible.
number 41
In this special imprint, the legs of a goddess are intertwined with the legs of two male persons. She's holding two snakes, which suggests that this entire event takes place under the influence of this reptile. Through its poison the participants get an expanded consciousness and become ‘seers’. This could mean that one of the persons is a human who, under the influence of the poison, ‘sees’ that he, together with a male deity, has united with a goddess. In a praise poem Šulgi tells that he drinks beer and I think that he is drinking that much that he gets an ‘elated heart’ and is able to experience the sun god Utu as his brother and the Sirius goddess Inanna as his spouse:
A praise poem of Šulgi
I drank beer in the palace founded by An with my brother and companion, the hero Utu. My
singers praised me with songs accompanied by seven tigi drums. My spouse, the maiden Inana, the lady, the joy of heaven and earth, sat with me at the banquet.



Number 42
I think we're seeing something similar here. In the first place we see a number of details that indicate the requirements of the Soma drink: for example: on the right a goddess sits on the tail of the lion that has been worked out as a snake. She is holding an ear of barley. In the middle, two plants grow on a mountain, like Hoama/Soma plants are born on mountains:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-62
Strong, mountain-born, the stalk hath been pressed in the streams for rapturous joy: Hawk-like he settles in his home.
So, a Haoma/Soma drink may have been made from the poison of the snake, the plants on the mountain and with a brew derived from barley. This potion causes an expanded consciousness through which one of the two men experiences that he, along with a deity, unites with the star goddess in their midst. This imprint shows that a man unites with his wife and during this act of love he experiences that he unites with a goddess who is simultaneously loved by a god. Experiencing gods and intimacy with them was not uncommon, because several rulers write that Inanna is their spouse and Gilgameš is their brother:
A praise poem of Lipit-Eštar
Uta-ulu imbued me, the man of his heart, with great awesomeness in E-šu-me-ša. I am he on whom Enki has bestowed wisdom: he gave me kingship in Eridug. As the beloved husband of Inana, I lift my head high in the place Unug. I am a proficient scribe of Nisaba. I am a young man whose word Utu confirms. I am the perfection of kingship. I am Lipit-Eštar, Enlil's son.
A praise poem of Ur-Namma
I am the creature of Nanna! I am the older brother of Gilgameš! I am the son borne by Ninsumun, a princely seed! For me, kingship came down from heaven! Sweet is the praise of me, the shepherd UrNamma!.
A praise poem of Išme-Dagan Inana, the lady of heaven and earth ......, chose me as her beloved spouse. She put attractiveness in my waist-belt (?), looking at me with her life-giving look, as she lifted her radiant forehead to me, to make me step onto the flowery bed. She has uttered her unalterable holy word for me to spend long, long days in the ĝipar, combining the priestly office of en with the kingship and caring unceasingly for E-ana, and for my neck to become thick like a wild bull's in Unug as my splendour covers Kulaba.
A praise poem of Šulgi
(9 lines fragmentary) To my brother and friend Gilgameš (4 lines fragmentary) (unknown no. of lines missing)



Number 43
On this North-Syrian cylinder seal (1850-1720 B.C.) two male persons, probably a god and a king, approach a naked woman. The two XE signs next to them may indicate that they inseminate the woman. As a result a child is created and on the left the woman is about to give birth to this child. In a praise poem (Lipit-Eštar B) we can read that Lipit-Eštar mentions his two fathers as he writes that he is a son of Enlil and that his father is Išme-Dagan. But he does not write anything about his human mother, he only mentions his heavenly one called: Ninlil.
Prince Lipit-Eštar, son of Enlil, wise shepherd, who leads the people to let them relax ...... in
pleasant shade, lord, great bison, beloved by An! Your trust is put in Mother Ninlil; Lipit-Eštar, you exert great power. Among joyful songs of the heart, in an auspicious regnal year, the prince, the powerful prince surpassing in greatness and majesty, your father Išme-Dagan, king of the Land, made the foundations of his throne firm for you.
Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL).
As we saw before: the XE signs mean 'barley', 'grain and seed'. If this sign meant: 'barley' beer could have been made, but if it meant: 'seed' then it indicates the insemination of the naked woman. For this moment I think the two XE signs meant both possibilities.



M-489B
This is a very interesting tablet from Mohenjo Daro because on this we can see that something similar was going on in the Indus Valley Civilization. In the middle we see a god and a goddess having communion with each other, and at the same time on the left side we see a plant growing on a hill. We can assume that this is a Soma plant, as it is said to grow in the mountains:
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-62
Strong, mountain-born, the stalk hath been pressed in the streams for rapturous joy: Hawk-like he settles in his home.
When this plant and the mating couple are placed next to each other, it is suggested that the mating of the two gods is accomplished under the influence of the Soma plant. In other words, that Soma was drunk and the husband and wife loved each other with ‘elated hearts’.
In Rigveda hymn no. 10-85 we can read that Surya and the moon god Soma are getting married. This happens with an expanded consciousness because Soma is drunk during the wedding party:
Rigveda hymne nr. 10-85
Truth is the base that bears the earth; by Surya are the heavens sustained. By Law the Adityas stand secure, and Soma holds his place in heaven. By Soma are the Adityas strong, by Soma mighty is the earth. Thus Soma in the midst of all these constellations hath his place. One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma's juice; Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no one ever tastes. Soma, secured by sheltering rules, guarded by hymns in Brhati, Thou standest listening to the stones none tastes of thee who dwells on earth.
When they begin to drink thee then, O God, thou swellest out again.
Vayu is Soma's guardian God. The Moon is that which shapes the years. Raibhi was her dear bridal friend, and Narasamsi led her home. Lovely was Surya's robe: she came to that which Gatha had adorned. Thought was the pillow of her couch, sight was the unguent for her eyes: Her treasury was earth and heaven. when Surya went unto her Lord. Hymns were the cross-bars of the pole, Kurira-metre decked the car: The bridesmen were the Asvin Pair Agni was leader of the train. Soma was he who wooed the maid: the groomsmen were both Asvins, when The Sun-God Savitar bestowed his willing Surya on her Lord. Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was heaven: Bright were both Steers that drew it when Surya approached her husband's, home.

This is a drawing of a large unfortunately damaged tableau of the birth chapel at the Temple of Luxor. The scene shows Queen Matemwia getting an ankh from Atum, in other words Atum gives her life, which means that the sky god makes her pregnant. The hieroglyphs surrounding this scene make it clear that the queen experienced the creating activity of the god Amun during the act of love:
Queen Matemwia
In Near Eastern Religious Texts Relating to the Old Testament, theologian and Bible scholar Dr. Walter Beyerlin, in collaboration with Dr. Brunner, provides an English translation of the same Luxor passage as follows:
‘How great is your power! How perfect is your...! How hidden are the plans which you make! How contented is your heart at my majesty! Your breath is in all my limbs,’ after the majesty of this god has done with me all that he willed...
Dr. Murnane's direct translation of the Egyptian inscription for the same birth scene is thus:
‘How great, indeed, is your power! How beautiful is [everything] which you have [done]. How hidden are the plans which you have made. How satisfied is your heart at my Person! Your
fragrance is throughout all my body.’ After this, (i.e.), the Person of this God's doing all that he wanted with her.
The feast of The Conception of Horus celebrates the Queen Mother as the mortal embodiment of the divine Great Mother. In the birth chapel at the Temple of Luxor we find a delicate rendering of the immaculate conception of pharaoh Amenhotep III as the embodiment of Horus. Well before conception, the divine child's birth is preordained. On his potter's wheel, the god Khnum already
shapes the twin images of the pharaoh and his ka, or ‘divine double.’ The spiritual contract has been struck between Khnum and the High God, in this case, Amun.

It was apparently common practice to obtain an expanded consciousness under the influence of Haoma or a similar drink, enabling one to perceive active gods. Apparently Queen Matemwia also took this mind-altering drink before or during the act of love, giving the experience that a creator god Amun himself participated in this act.

Two rows of scorpions and two rows of snakes are carved alternately on this vase. This makes it clear that this vase is intended to mix the poison of scorpions and snakes.
Number 46
The top register of the imprint depicts two scorpions and a stylized serpent. This means that the poison of these two species are mixed together to make a Haoma or Soma drink. Below we see that a banquet is being held at which the Haoma drink is drunk.
Rigveda hymn nr. 9-106
O Indu, with thy streams, in might, flow for the banquet of the Gods: Rich in meath, Soma, in our beaker take thy place. Thy drops that swim in water have exalted Indra to delight: The Gods have drunk thee up for immortality.



Number 47
This is one of many inauguration scenes. It is clear that the meeting of the seated god and the man who carries a kid over his shoulder takes place under the influence of Haoma based on snake and scorpion poison.
Number 48
This imprint shows the inauguration of the person on the right. The seated person holds a cup filled with Haoma, derived from the dates of the palm tree and the poison of both the snake and the scorpion. When drinking this drink, the consciousness of this person will be expanded, enabling him to determine the fate of the person for him.
Number 49
Let me introduce the storm god Adad to you. On this imprint he is ploughing. A raven flies above the plough. It may represent a constellation mentioned in ‘The 23 Stars on the Path of Anu from the text from Mul.Apin:’
9 The Raven UGA. (MUSHEN), the star of d.Adad [Corus]
It is the constellation of Adad, the storm and rain god in the Canaanite and ancient Mesopotamian religions.
In religious texts, Ba‘al/Hadad is the lord of the sky who governs the rain and thus the germination of plants with the power to determine fertility. He is the protector of life and growth to the agricultural people of the region.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad



Number 50
Three ravens indicate three helpers of Adad
Here three ravens fly above a plough indicating the helpers of Adad (his Sumerian name is
Iškur).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad
Lugalbanda in the mountain cave, Segment A
They are gazelles of Suen running in flight, they are the fine smooth cloths of Ninlil, they are the helpers of Iškur; they pile up flax, they pile up barley; they are wild animals on the rampage, they descend like a storm on a rebel land hated by Suen, indeed they descend like a storm.
This imprint is ploughed by three men. A scorpion is depicted above the plow, which suggests that before plowing the men drank a drink in which the poison of this little animal was mixed. Because they have drunk this drink, they can plow with an expanded consciousness.
The crescent moon on top suggests that this ploughing happens at new moon, as occurs with all important rituals:
A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan
Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land gather around her so that the divine powers are
perfected. The great Anuna gods, having bowed before them, stand there with prayers and supplications and utter prayers on behalf of all the lands..
Number 51
On this imprint the cuneiform inscription writes the name of the seal owner: ‘Bilzum’, as
well as his function: ‘overseer'. He stands next to the inscription and plows his land together with a god who has a scorpion-hand. A raven, flying above the arm of this god, identify him as Adad/Iškur. He is a channel inspector of heaven and earth, he is the bringer of plenty:
Enki and the world order
Enki placed in charge of all this him who rides on the great storms, who attacks with lightning bolts, the holy bar which blocks the entrance to the interior of heaven, the son of An, the canal inspector of heaven and earth -- Iškur, the bringer of plenty, the son of An.
The scorpion hand and the dragon-snake pulling the plough show that Soma, based on the poison of these two animals, gives strength to plough the field like it gives strength to Indra:
Rigveda hymn nr 9-46
Pressed in the mortar, these, the drops of juice, the Somas rich in food,
Give strength to Indra with their work.



Number 52
This special stamp features a scorpion and a womb sign. This womb sign suggests that the scorpion is female and thus represents the great goddess Ishara:
Ishara (Išḫara) was the tutelary goddess of the ancient Syrian city of Ebla. The origin of her name is unknown. Both Hurrian and West Semitic etymologies have been proposed, but they found no broad support and today it is often assumed that her name belongs to an unknown linguistic substrate.
Her cult had a wide reach across the ancient Near East. In addition to Ebla, she was also worshiped in cities such as Mari, Emar, Alalakh and Ugarit. From these Syrian cities the worship of Ishara spread to Mesopotamia. The Hurrians also adopted her into their pantheon after arriving in Syria, from which she found her way to the Hittite pantheon. In various time periods and areas different functions were assigned to her. In Ebla she was the
tutelary deity of the ruling family, but also a love goddess. In Mesopotamia the latter function lead
to an association with Ishtar, and later Nanaya, Kanisurra and Gazbaba as well. In Hurrian religion she acquired the role of a goddess associated with the underworld and disease, and in that capacity she was closely associated with Allani, the Hurrian queen of the dead. She was also regarded as a
goddess of divination and a divine guardian of oaths.
Ishara was also worshipped within the Hurrian pantheon. She was associated with the underworld. Her astrological embodiment is the constellation Scorpio and she is called the mother of the Sebitti (the Seven Stars) (Seux, 343). Ishara was well known in Syria from the third millennium B.C. She became a great goddess of the Hurrian population. She was worshipped with Teshub and Simegi at Alakh, and also at Ugarit, Emar and Chagar Bazar. While she was considered to belong to the entourage of Ishtar, she was invoked to heal the sick (Lebrun).
She is also already attested as a goddess of love in texts from Ebla, and Piotr Taracha goes as far as suggesting it was her oldest function. She was represented in this role in Mesopotamia as well, in part possibly due to association with Ishtar, though Frans Wiggermann regards the two of them as
independent from each other in this role. As a love goddess, Ishara was specifically connected to
the institution of marriage, though incantations associate her with erotic love as well. In Akkadian
texts she could be referred to as the 'lady of love,' bēlet ru'āmi.'
In later periods, for example on boundary stones (kudurru) Ishara was instead symbolically represented by the scorpion. Neither the reason behind attribution of either symbol to her nor why the change from bashmu to scorpion occurred are known. Like her, scorpions were associated with marriage in Mesopotamian culture. In Babylonian astronomy, she was associated with the 'scorpion star' (mulgir-tab). As a love goddess, Ishara could also be associated with cannabis.

Snake Soma god Scorpion Dates Sheep Barley
I end this essay with this very remarkable imprint of an Archaic cylinder seal found in Persia. At first glance it looks like the imprint of a practice seal with some random images. But suddenly we see a scorpion crawling on the surface and a snake zigzagging across the ground. Immediately afterwards we see a twig with dates on it. And now we can make the guess that a barley ear is depicted next to the human figure and that the quadruped in the middle must be a sheep. It should be clear that these figures provide ingredients with which the priests make the Soma drink. We can now speculate about this human figure who carries something in both of his hands: he must be a Soma drinker, a Seer, or the god of Soma himself.

The goblet is red with a continuous band of cut to clear decoration in the form of a grape vine with grape clusters, leaves, and curly tendrils. This is a fine handblown piece, and would be a great addition to any flash glass collection. The goblet is in great overall condition. There are some minor abrasions to the red here and there, but nothing excessive. There is a tiny fleabite to the foot rim...

Ceramic baked plaques were mass- produced from moulds in Southern Mesopotamia already from the second millennium BC. and represent a form of art available to a wide audience. The casting of plaques was a simple and inexpensive way to produce relief images, since numerous plaques could be made from a single mould. They have been excavated in temples as well as in household shrines of private homes. Though their exact purpose is not clear, they may have had magical or religious significance. Their subject matter varies widely, as they show informal scenes and reflect the private face of life, by including religious images, mythological and erotic scenes and representations of rulers and gods.

Green in what they called the main deposit in the temple of Horus at Hierakonpolis during the dig season of 18971898. It measures 25 centimeters long, is made of limestone, is pear-shaped, and is attributed to the pharaoh Scorpion (c. 3200–3000 BCE) due to the glyph of a scorpion engraved close to the image of a king wearing the White Crown of Upper Egypt.
