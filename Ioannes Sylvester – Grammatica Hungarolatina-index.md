Preface
Jdnos Sylvester s life and work
Janos Sylvester's work (c. 1504 - before 1552) is of innovative significance in the development of the Hungarian language approach and the grammatical literature. From the aspect of Hungarian literal and cultural history, it is especially important that Sylvester worked on the improvement of his mother tongue in Erasmus' and Luther's spirit with a scientific exaction. According to our present knowledge, he edited the first systematic Hungarian grammar, Grammatica Hungarolatina, published in this volume.
There is a document known since the 16th century according to which the Hungarian humanist poet, Janus Pannonius, working in the second half of the 15,h century, prepared a Latin-Hungarian grammar. Later on, this work was mentioned again and again, and there were some in the 18,h century who claimed to have seen Janus Pannonius's grammar with their own eyes. The debate on his possible authorship has gone on for a long time in Hungarian literature. However, no proof has appeared on the basis of which we could conclude that the lost or hidden Latin-Hungarian grammar assigned to Janus Pannonius is not really his work. Based on the available data, we can assume that in the second half of the 18,h century specimens of an old bilingual grammar were known which were not those of Janos Sylvester's Grammatica Hungarolatina. Still, until we have unequivocal proof of an earlier, similar work, we must consider Sylvester the author of the first Hungarian Grammar.
Few details are known of Janos Sylvester's life. We know exactly from Grammatica Hungarolatina that he was born in Szinervaralja, in East Hungary's Szatmar county (Seini, Rumania). He probably completed his secondary studies in the urban school of the nearby mining city, Nagybanya (Baia Mare, Rumania). He enrolled in the University of Cracow in 1526, where he met for the first time the numerous manifestations of the language approach of European humanism. As is well-known, the most important works of the different grammatical trends were published one by one in Cracow. Sylvester himself contributed to the editions of grammatical publications, which we will describe later.
7



Sylvester's first known literary work was issued in Cracow. The Rosarium Celeste Virginis Mariae... includes two Latin poems. The distichs of the first poem tell Virgin Mary's life based on the rhythmical prayers written about Virgin Mary's delights and originating in the Middle Ages. The second poem is the story of Saint Clement of Rome written in Sapphoic lines. In 1529, Sylvester enrolled in the University of Wittenberg and took lectures from Melanchthon. From 1534 on, he lived in West Hungary, Sarvar, in the house of his patron, Tamas Nadasdy, and taught in the elementary school of the small settlement. He was probably in Wittenberg for the second time at some point between the end of 1534 and the beginning of 1536. This is proven by - among others things - the numerous common features of Grammatica Hungarolatina and the Latin-German grammars widely available there at that time. Sylvester started to translate the New Testament into Hungarian in the middle of the 1530s. For the printing of the work, Tamas Nadasdy established a workshop in Ujsziget, near Sarvar. Grammatica Hungarolatina was its first publication in 1539, a "prestudy" to the great task, the Hungarian New Testament. Sylvester not only created the first theoretical system of the Hungarian language, but as a translator he also showed how to recreate the sacred texts in his mother tongue keeping in mind the severity of the humanists' Bible criticism. He worked on the grounds of Erasmus's Greek-Latin edition. The greatest result of his linguistic interest is that after the earlier partial translations he was the first to prepare a complete Hungarian New Testament. The work came to light in Sarvar-Ujsziget in 1541. From the aspect of printing history, its special significance is that it is the first book produced in Hungary in the Hungarian language. For Hungarian literary history, it is extremely important that Sylvester wrote a preface to the whole work and to certain parts in Hungarian distichs. After the earlier primitive mother-tongue expression of some lines, these are the first longer, prosodically perfect Hungarian metrical poems of literary value. From the explanations attached to the translation, the discussion titled "Testimony about such verbs (=words) that are not understood in their own contexts (=in their own, first meaning)" is of high value from the viewpoint of critical history. Sylvester here discourses on the metaphoric way of expression; he considers this figurative language the value of the contemporary Hungarian love poetry consisting of flower songs that are textually almost unknown today. Sylvester embodied the Erasmian idea of the "homo trilinguis". Making use of his skills in sacred languages, he joined the University of Vienna upon Tamas Nadasdy's recommendation. He was a professor of Hebrew from 1543, and Greek from 1546 until 1550. His Latin poems were published: his elegy against the Turks (1544), his poem personalizing Vienna (1546), the epitaph of Queen Anna (Anna Jagello, wife of the Hungarian king, Emperor Ferdinand I) (1548),
8



the lament of Jesus resurrected (about 1550), the lament of faith (1551). There are no other data available about his life and death.
Jdnos Sylvester s linguistic works
At the University of Cracow, Sylvester belonged to the famous English humanist, Leonard Cox's Erasmian circle. In Hieronymus Vietor's press, he also collaborated on editions of grammatical manuals. His first work of this kind was to prepare the Hungarian interpretations of a basic Latin grammar. Its basis, the Latin Rudimenta is an extract of Donatus's Ars Minor, which was edited by the Liineburg school professor, Christianus Hegendorphinus (Christian Hegendorff). The heart of the booklet is the discussion of the eight traditional parts of speech. The rules are illustrated with examples taken from the classic Latin authors and the Bible. From the viewpoint of grammatical literature in national language, the German, Polish and Hungarian interpretations are especially important. Most of the time, these are paradigms parallel to Latin and sometimes terms in national language.
The idea of the four-language edition originated with the printer, Vietor, as he tells it in his commendation. The commendation is addressed to Georgius de Logkschau (Georg von Logau), the counsel and ambassador in Poland to Ferdinand I. The German amendments surely came from Hegendorff. The author of the Polish interpretations must have been Vietor himself, and the Hungarian parts were surely written by Janos Sylvester. He says so in his recommending poem attached to the end of the work. It is especially interesting to observe Sylvester's first experiences when he compares his mother tongue to Latin. He calls the Hungarian language "Paeon". The name "Paeon" for a nation was identified with the Pannons by the Byzantine grammarians. It is common knowledge that in the Roman age a part of the later Hungary belonged to the province of Pannonia. Sylvester excuses himself for the rudeness of the name "Paeon" in case it hurts the ears of those accustomed to the clarity of Latin:
Quandoquidem Rhomana phrasis, non semper aperte Accipit externum, in flexibus, illa, sonum, Paeonicum si forte tuas offenderit aures, Errori lector candide parce precor.
This is worth noting because in his later working periods Sylvester self-consciously praises the virtues of the Hungarian language. In Grammatica Hungarolatina for instance, he even argues with Melanchthon who claimed that the article only existed in Greek and German. Sylvester proudly emphasizes that Hungarian surpasses Latin in this respect because it also uses articles.

On the last page, the Hungarian Our Father and Hail Mary strengthen the Hungarian elements of the four-language Rudimenta of Cracow from 1527. From the three national languages, long coherent texts can be read only in Hungarian in the publication. The booklet is especially significant to Hungarian literary history because it is the oldest known presswork which contains a coherent Hungarian text. Sylvester's second grammatical work, a collection of conversations adapted to schoolchildren's intellectual level, also belongs to the type of textbooks spread in elementary Latin education. In 1527, Vietor published several works of this kind. One of them, the rector of Niirnberg, Heyden Sebald's work entitled Puerilium colloquiorum formulae, includes Hungarian translations of the conversations as well as German and Polish. This is also surely Sylvester's work, just like the Hungarian interpretations of the Rudimenta published some months before. This publication also closes with a Latin recommending poem in which Sylvester generally depicts the usefulness of knowledge with humanist commonplaces. Even if he does not refer to his own role in the birth of the work, we have no reason to suppose that the writer of the recommending poem is not the same as the author of the Hungarian versions of the conversations. The comparison of the lingual characteristics of the Puerilium colloquiorum formulae and the Rudimenta also confirms Sylvester's authorship.
What makes the Hungarian text especially valuable is that it does not insist on following the Latin sample, but interprets the conversations in different situations quite freely. In this way, it truly reflects the living language usage and expressions from the first half of the 16lh century. Thus, it is a precious document not only for linguistics but also for cultural history. Puerilium colloquiorum formulae had several further editions. We know about three other Cracow editions of the four-language version: from 1531, 1535, and 1552 -and it is absolutely possible that others might turn up. Foruse in Hungarian schools, it was published many times in different towns. Approximately 15 versions of it are known or can be assumed; the latest from about 1800. There are some that only include the Latin and Hungarian conversations. Sylvester's outdated expressions were later updated to more modern ones. The phonetic phenomena were also altered such as the i-tendency typical of Sylvester's dialect. The material was formed according to the needs of the nations living in the territory of historical Hungary: there is for instance a Latin-German-Czech version as well. The Czech edition was adapted for the Protestant Slovakians of Upper Hungary who used the language of the Bohemian Czech Bible-translation as literary language.

Grammatica Hungarolatina
Parallel to the discussion of Latin grammar, in this work Sylvester attempted to methodically elaborate the regularities of his mother tongue as well. It is easy to see that his endeavors are connected to the best humanist traditions. As is well-known, on the initial level of a humanist Latin education Alexander de Villa Dei's Doctrinale was replaced by Donatus's elementary compendium throughout Europe. Fixing the regularities of vulgar languages is in close connection with Latin grammars. The development of the grammatical literature of national languages is an exciting chapter in the history of linguistics. Simultaneously with the humanist culture of Latin, attention turned more and more toward the national languages all over Europe during the 15,h and 16,h centuries. For exigent language use, the norms were searched for in the classic authors' texts and in the Latin grammarians' summaries. Certain humanists aristocratically and loftily considered national languages barbaric, but others accepted the reality of mother tongue communication, and they tried to harmonize the use of national languages with the new educational intentions. This was justified by practical needs as well: the scientific Latin was not suitable for everyday tasks. Besides administration, mother tongue played an increasingly strong role in literature and linguistics as well, national identity was expressed by its judgement. This is why the cultivation of national languages was considered important. Regarding vernacular languages, the apologetic voice became more and more panegyric. The Italian humanists' example was followed also in the areas north of the Alps. Being grammatical meant the means to measure the value of national languages, thus, the possibility to describe the language grammatically. For the systematization of vulgar languages, Latin grammar was the example. As a result of the parallel elaborations, came the realization that certain national languages could not be adjusted to Latin in all respects. The formation of the grammars of living European languages and the recording of language norms started with listing the regularities related to unique features. The development of grammatical literature effectively contributed to the birth of language standards.
As a result of the detailed examination of medieval Latin teaching, it is clearly visible how the road lead from Latin grammatical comments to the systematization of vulgar languages into national languages. In the beginning, the Latin material was accompanied by only Latin explanations. Later, however, to circumscribe the parts to be enlightened, not only Latin synonyms were used, but some expressions in national language also appeared. This created the frame in which mother tongue explanations gradually transcended the limits of a simple comment. This happens when certain mother tongue expressions appear not only as arbitrary or accidental substitutes for Latin synonyms but the Latin text can be read in an exact mother tongue translation. As we can see, Sylvester's first grammatical works are Hungarian amend
11



ments to Latin-German manuals. In education in German language areas, mother tongue had its biggest role in the Donatus editions. The ways in which mother tongue could better serve the understanding of Latin were shaped in the first decades of the 16lh century. Regarding the relationship of national language and Latin, two ideas can be distinguished in the education. The most outstanding humanists - such as Rudolphus Agricola or Melanchthon - supposed that mother tongue could be a suitable aid in studying Latin, but only at the beginning. The examples in national languages are useful on an elementary level but the aim is to make Latin the language of communication in education as soon as possible. For a highly educated humanist the most important thing is to perfectly express himself in Latin both in writing and speaking, this is why he must get used to speaking Latin as early as possible in school. Therefore, the German examples serve exclusively the better understanding of Latin: they mostly appeared in the paradigms or as interpretations of certain words. It was not considered important to word the rules in German. According to the other theory, mother tongue is not only an aid to studying Latin. The representatives of this trend strove to teach the students the system of their own language parallel to the acquisition of Latin grammar, and make them able to describe the system in German as well. These aims were realized best in the bilingual Donatus editions, so the parallel Latin-German Donatus editions are considered the direct antecedents to the grammars elaborating the German language in German. According to Istvan Szathmari, in the second quarter of the 16lh century there were three ways to the discovery of the Hungarian language - similarly to that of other vulgar languages. The Hungarian explanations, examples and paradigms attached to Donarus's Latin grammar mark the first way; the rules worded during translation are the second; and the third is the use of the mother tongue in scholarly education. As a result, students could not only more easily acquire Latin grammar, but also the rules of the Hungarian language. Thanks to the Cracowian printer, Hieronymus Vietor, the Polish and Hungarian interpretations were annexed to Hegendorffs work among the innumerable Latin-German Donatus editions. From the treatments in national language, the complete grammatical systems of neither the Hungarian nor Polish languages are visible, but it is still extremely important that they, like the German, also appear parallel to Latin. Thus in the 1527 Rudimenta, the systematization of Hungarian also began alongside the two other living languages used in Central Europe, for the time being adapted to the Latin grammar categories. In his parallel Latin-Hungarian grammar, Grammatica Hungarolatina, Janos Sylvester was already striving for the complete systematization of his mother tongue. The only sample at our disposal does not contain a syntax. The question has arisen whether the solitary sample is incomplete. There are assumptions that a syntax might have been connected to it which has been lost. This can be concluded from two allusions in the available text which refer to
12



the second book. However, there has also arisen the explanation that Sylvester mechanically included these allusions, taken from one of his models, but did not write a syntax. In our opinion, the existing specimen is complete. The "Liber secundus" is first mentioned after the second possible grouping of the main parts of grammar (orthographia, prosodia, etymologia, syntaxis). Sylvester refers to the division explained earlier (littera, syllaba, dictio, oratio), and he emphasizes that the two groupings are closely connected: "Quae superioribus ita sunt cognatae, ut ab illis separari nullo modo possint. Orthographia enim litterarum est, prosodia syllabarum, etymologia dictionum, syntaxis orationum. De quibus singulis consilium non est hoc loco agere, sed de orthographia tantum, et quidem quoad eius fieri potest, brevissime. Si quis plura his hac de re desiderat, legat ea, quae secundo tractantur libello." (On page 33 in the present edition.) He specifies that he only talks about orthography at a given place (hoc loco) and those wishing to know more should read what the second book discusses. This means that the second book contains the parts succeeding orthography. At the end of the part about orthography, Sylvester also refers to the second book. In the first part, some prosodic questions are mentioned as well (accentus). After some examples, the author continues as follows: "Dictionum quippe accentum unicuique natura in patrio sermone, absque ullis praeceptis suppeditat. Exempla peregrinarum harum vocum copiosa ex libro secundo, quem nominatim huic rei dicavimus, peti cum possint, nullis hic nos usi sumus exemplis." (On page 35 in the present edition.) So as for the accent of certain words in mother tongue everybody can rely on his or her own natural language instinct, no rule is needed. Numerous examples referring to foreign languages are offered in the second book, which is exactly about the accent and pronunciation of certain words. It is doubtless that there is neither a "Liber primus" nor "Liber secundus" internal title within the text. Nevertheless, both cited allusions clearly reveal that by the second book Sylvester means the material following orthography (and prosody discussed with it), and from that he means the information about certain words (dictio). This is morphology (etymologia), the discussion of the certain parts of the speech (partes orationis), or, in our thinking today, that of the word categories. This is contained within the major part of Grammatica Hungarolatina. Thus, we have no reason to presume a lost syntax, because Sylvester's two allusions to the second book refer to the thoroughly elaborated morphology. From a culture historical aspect, we have to emphasize that Janos Sylvester's activity perfectly corresponds to the language cultivating endeavours of contemporary Europe. We have briefly referred to the development of the grammatical literature of national languages. On the basis of Grammatica Hungarolatina we can see that, thanks to Janos Sylvester in the first half of the 16th century, the Hungarian language exactly fit into the process by which the systematizations of different national languages were born one by one out of a scientific need, leaning on, but inexorably breaking away from the guidance of Latin grammar.

The earlier editions and the literature o/Grammatica Hungarolatina
From the original edition of the work, the presswork made in Sarvar-Ujsziget in 1539, one single sample is known, which is kept in Budapest, in the National Szechenyi Library. (Its reference is RMNY 39). Between 1808 and 1997, the modern transcription of the text was published four times by two editors, twice the facsimile of the original presswork was also issued. (See the Bibliography.) Zoltan Eder (Sylvester Grammatikdjdnak utoeleterol, On the Afterlife ofSylvesters Grammar, Bp., 1990) mentions an 1807 edition as well, edited by Ferencz Kazinczy. Eder was probably mislead by incorrect bibliographic data. The 1807 seems improbable because in Kazinczy's letters of that year there is not a word about Sylvester's grammar but he often mentions it from August of 1808 on. It is hard to imagine that if the efforts going on for years had finally brought a result, Kazinczy would not have reported on it. He also speaks about the edition of 1808 in his Pdlydm emlekezete (Memories ofmy Career). Furthermore, it could not be accidental that in the preface of the 1808 edition Kazinczy writes the following about his earlier plan: "I can finally see my wish coming true, and I am hastening to publish it so that we can have for the second time what time has, with envy, taken away from us". If the work had been published between 1539 and 1808, he should have called the last edition the third one.
Besides the editions of the text, the Hungarian translation must also be mentioned. (See the Bibliography.) The 16,h-century presswork is difficult to read; it has lead to many misunderstandings. The text editions were not made with a critical demand, and they contained several errors. The facsimiles as such are not appropriate for the right reading; they were published in small numbers and, indeed, are hardly available. This is why the present edition of the work is justified. To survey the literature of Grammatica Hungarolatina, Piroska Lilla Nagyne's Sylvester Jdnos bibliogrdfia (Bibliography ofJdnos Sylvester), published in 1987, is indispensable since it summarizes the entries so far. From the earlier literature, we must mention by all means Janos Balazs's monograph (Sylvester Jdnos es kora, Jdnos Sylvesters Life and Age, Bp., 1958). Balazs's results are mostly correct today as well, however, in the light of more recent research they would need amendments or modifications at some points. From the viewpoint of linguistics history, Sylvester's work is the most thoroughly summarized by Istvan Szathmari (Regi magyar nyelvtanaink es egysegesiilo irodalmi nyelviink, Our Old Grammars and Uniting Literary Language, Bp., 1968, 69-139.) The literature relating to Grammatica Hungarolatina after 1987 is collected in the bibliography attached. From the viewpoint of research history, Zoltan Eder's study referred to above is of special importance.

About thepresent edition
The original presswork does not contain chapter titles. The beginnings of the main parts are signed by figurative initials. The recommending poems and the recommending letter is followed by the general introduction and the summary of Hungarian spelling, and then by Donatus's eight parts of speech. For higher transparency, we have marked the bigger units with Roman numerals, and have given the names of the eight parts as chapter titles. These are put into pointed brackets. A significant part of the work is devoted to the different examples of inflection. Similarly to many other old works, in the original presswork the paradigms often appear in continuous text. The editions of Grammatica Hungawlatina up to now have used this solution. However, we differ from this practice in the present edition, and we give the paradigms in the form of charts. This makes the material much more transparent, and it is simpler for studying the presented grammar system. Where Sylvester organized the paradigms into charts, he often only gave their endings, the last syllable or syllables. We restore these to the complete form, again for the sake of easier tractability. The text of Grammatica Hungarolatina is mostly in Latin and the use of capitals is rather inconsequential. When transcribing, we keep in mind the language use and the essential spelling characteristics of the age. Thus, in our edition the names of nations and their derivatives (Graeci, lingua Graeca, Graece), the months, and the word Christianus are always written with capitals. In other cases, we have standardized the text according to the Latin spelling used today in Hungary. We write the ranks and functions with small letters although Sylvester used capitals (Princeps, Dux, Comes, Ban). The grammar categories (nomen, verbum) are also written with small letters in continuous text. For the sake of the uniform typographical appearance, we proceed similarly in the charts and the derivative examples of the paradigms. We keep the parts wholly written with capitals if the aim of Sylvester's typographical emphasis is to accentuate the important feature of the content. Also adapting to the spelling used today in Hungary, we transcribe the word "litera", consistently written with one / by Sylvester, to "littera".
We do not highlight or differentiate between the orthographical variants in the Latin text. The letters and connections of letters not used today are changed to their present correspondent. The abbreviations are written out in full and the punctuation is implicitly complete, except for the cases when Sylvester made up whole sentences into the form of charts, where we have abandoned punctuation. The treatments that serve the better understanding of the text are put into pointed brackets. This method seemed most reasonable in the derivative charts. For example, Sylvester often neglected to mark the time and mode of verbs. For the reader today, the system is much clearer if the information needed for
15



identification is there before the paradigms, strictly adjusting to Sylvester's grammatical concept.
For the study of the Hungarian elements, the mother tongue sections are especially important. These are published letter-perfect, including the punctuation marks not used today. In the Hungarian texts, we have not changed the original punctuation. We followed the author also in the use of capitals and small letters, except for the charts of paradigms for the typographical reason mentioned above. In the Greek text, we supplement the missing accents. For the editing of the Hebrew texts, we owe our thanks to Pal Nemeth who implicitly corrected the typesetting errors of the original presswork.
There is no need for a complicated textual critical system, because there is only one edition of Grammatica Hungarolatina, which was edited by the author. Consequently, there are no essential text variations to be regarded. In the case of corrected printing mistakes, we give the original text and marginal remarks of the original presswork in the footnotes. We also publish the sources of the citations in the text in our footnotes. The explanations following the text mostly contain data needed for the identification of personal and geographical names not considered commonly known. We also attach short explanations to the features connected to the circumstances of the forming of Grammatica Hungarolatina and to other areas of Sylvester's work.
As the first known systematized Hungarian grammar, Grammatica Hungarolatina plays a very important role in the history of Hungarian linguistics. Its detailed presentation cannot be considered the task of this edition because in that case we would need to attach long linguistic discussions to almost each word of the text. The bibliography appended can serve as a starting point for orientation in the further literature of both Hungarian and European linguistics history. Istvan Bartok

GRAMMATICA HUNGAROLATINA in usum puerorum recens scripta Ioanne Sylvestro Pannonio autore
De nova, apud nostros, beneficio principis nostri, imprimendi arte ad iuvenes hexastichon
5
Quisquis in hoc ludo studiis incumbis honestis, Haec nova quae cernis iam cape dona libens. Progressum spondent studiorum nanque tuorum, Dives quae nunquam Pannonis ora tulit. Atque tuo meritas noctesque, diesque referre 10 Ne cesses grates qui exhibet ista, duci.
Neanesi, anno 1539. die 14 Iunii.






Tetrastichon ad pueros
Prima, puer primis, discas rudimenta, sub annis Imis contemptis, nec cito summa petas. Icarus et Phaeton exemplo sint tibi, quorum Interitum fluvius sensit, et unda maris.
Ad Theodorum filium carmen endecasyllabum
Sub Luna genito nova, novum nunc Nato, prodit opus novo, novum sit Ut munus pueris, novo sub anno Qui formam studii novam sequuntur. Ut dictat schola quam novam, novellis Erexit pueris, in urbe noster Princeps, quae nova, dicta, quod sit inter Curvos, insula, fluminum recessus. Quin tu nate, novum, precamur, ut sis In Christi populo novo, per orbem, Caecas, pellere quod queat tenebras Astrorumque ducem piis, oriri Curet pectoribus, tenelle, sidus.
In osorem
Livide quid nostrum mordaci dente libellum Conficis, explere hoc non potes ingluviem.






EPISTOLA NUNCUPATORIA ad Theodorum iilium
Visum est mihi imprimis utile esse, Theodore, fili mi, antequam Novum Testamentum sermone nostro patrio, nostra opera, in manus exeat hominum, 5 haec scribere TrpoTrai&euuaTa, nominatimque tibi, quem in exilio super exilium genui, nuncupare. Duplici quippe nomine. Primum, quod puerilia pueros maxime decent. Deinde, quod cui haec praeter te inscriberem habebam neminem. Prius enim haec a quibusdam contempta sunt, prius Tfje ua9aioTex^ac nomine damnata quam lucem essent adepta. Id autem usu venire solet partim ob ma10 lignantem horum naturam. Partim vero et potissime, quod hi nondum satis intelligunt, quantum hoc studiorum genus, rectis studiis momenti praebeat, quantumque referat ex naturali sermone peregrinum comparare. Et quamquam haec aliis parva nimis ac contemnenda videantur, tibi tamen, fili mi, magnum debet videri, quidquid a parente tuo singulari proficiscitur affectu. Insaniam sane ego 15 cum ceteris nationibus, modo cum tuo ac tui similium commodo qualicunque. Ad hunc enim modum et reliquae nationes, tenuibus in suis ipsorum linguis, propositis praeceptis, teneram aetatem sensim ad altiora provehunt studia, et quasi praemansum illis praebent, nec patiuntur prius, ad summa gradum facere, quam quae primo discenda erant probe tenuerint. Qua re quantum rectis studiis 20 consulant, res ipsa loquitur. Videmus enim apud illas iuventutem in litterarum studio brevi ad aliquod ingenii nomen pervenire, ac mox ad eruditionis fastigium ascendere. In qua etiam completur, quod proverbio dici solet; generosi arboris plantam statim cum fructu esse, cui etiam candidus studiosorum grex de profectu studiorum hisce gratulatur verbis: "Ovaio oov TauTTjc Tf|c TroXuuaQi25 ac. Cor.tra nostra iuventus aut raro admodum, aut nunquam ad bonam pervenit frugem. Id quod haud dubie evenire solet, atque studiorum verum negligat ordinem, statimque ad summa illa, neglectis aut etiam contemptis, humilibus rei grammaticae praeceptis, prosiliat. Summa enim illa (ut vere Fabius sensit) sine horum tenuium praeceptorum fundamentis stare nequeunt. Et quamvis multum 30 laboret, eodem tamen iuxta proverbium in statu semper esse deprehenditur, ut mirari possis, quanta rebus in omnibus recti ordinis sit vis. Scribimus enim haec ad reliquarum nationum exemplum in usum elementariorum puerorum, quos publice docemus, illorum quidem praesentem, tuum vero, fili mi, futurum. Scribimus autem non otii abundantia, sed necessitate compulsi. Nam posteaquam 35 me fortuna eo detrusit, ut elementariorum puerorum sim praeceptor, re ipsa comperi opus esse institutionum pueris in patria quoque lingua ad pernoscendas casuum doctrinas reliquamque linguae proprietatem. Accipe itaque, Theodore fili, hoc quidquid est muneris, accipe, inquam, quasi bona a parente tuo tibi debita. Neque enim aliud bonorum genus tibi nunc donare possum. Bona 40 enim et patria et avita iure hereditario tibi debita, partim improbi cives, partim

ii, qui presbyterorum sese nomine venditant, indigne possident. Habebis tamen haud dubie sat bona, si procedente aetate deum timere occeperis. Qui enim te intra abditos materni uteri sinus admirabili sua providentia mensibus compluribus fovit, idem editi in lucem de victu ceterisque vitae necessariis providebit. 5 Quod autem ad curam attinet paternam, nec ipse tibi deero, iuvante me ad hoc principe meo, qui non vulgarem mei una tecum curam se gerere mihi iam olim recepit. Det tibi Deus, fili mi, incrementum.

GRAMMATICA HUNGAROLATINA in usum puerorum nunc primum scripta, Ioanne Sylvestro authore
<I. DEFINITIO ET PARTES GRAMMATICAE. ORTHOGRAPHIA>
Grammatica est ars recte loquendi et scribendi authoritate optimorum poetarum et oratorum constans. Docet enim primum, quae vocum inter se sit differentia. Deinde, quae dictionum componendarum ratio. Ac doctrinam quidem tradit, quae est circa litteras, syllabas et casus. Constructionem vero, quae est circa voces recte scriptas, modulatas et inflexas, quae singula nisi probe tenuerimus, nihil unquam recte vel scribimus vel enunciamus. In hoc ergo grammatica inventa est, ut recte tum loquendi, tum scribendi esset magistra. rpauucmKT| Graeca vox est, Latine dici potest litteratura, Betukrul ualo tudomah.

25
Partes grammaticae sunt:
littera. benl
syllaba. eggbefoglalas.
dictio. ighe.
oratio. belsid.
LITTERA
utD.
ut Dul.
ut Dulcis.
ut Dulcis amor patriae. Ides az hazanak fierelme.
Littera est minima pars vocis articulatae. Az Betu az Szonak mentul kufsebb rilse. melTet betukuel meg irhatnak Litterae, quibus Latini utuntur, sunt tres et viginti: a b c d e f g h i k l m n o pqrstuxyz.
29



Ex his quasdam certis distinguimus notis, quasdam geminamus, quo patrii sermonis voces commodius possimus ducere: a c cz e. g gh y ij 1' li 6 £ $ f u. Sunt, qui his Latinorum litteris Graecas censeant miscendas, quod equidem 5 non probo. Neque enim sumus 'aypduuaTa Cioa, ut his Latinorum litteris sermo noster Hungaricus exprimi nequeat.
Divisio litterarum
vocales, szotiu6k.
10 consonantes, mafual zengh6k.
Litterarum aliae: mutae, nimak.
15
semivocales, feJ£otiu6k.
liquidae, eloluadok.
20 Vocales sunt quinque:
A E I O U
Vocales numero licet sint quinque, potestate tamen sunt septem. Quandoquidem (iuxta Diomedis grammatici sententiam) E et pro e et r\ Graecis vocalibus 25 Latini solent ponere, O vero et pro o et io. Praeter necessitatem itaque quidam OJ in orthographia nostri sermonis litteris putat miscendum esse Latinis. Vocales omnes in nostra lingua, ut in Hebraea, duplicis sunt et potestatis et figurae dempta I littera. Nunc enim sunt rectae, nunc obliquae.

Consonantes sunt sedecim: b, c, d, f, g, h, k, 1, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, x. Quibus quidam z adiciunt.
Consonantes dicuntur, quod interdum praepositae, interdum subiectae vo30 calibus consonant. Hog niha el61 niha utol uettetuinn. az Szotiu6kuel egetembe tifinek zenghift.
Mutae, quod sine vocalium adminiculo non possint enunciari. Hog az 6otiu6knek feghijczighe nelkul ki nem mondathatnak. 35 Sunt autem numero novem: b, c, d, f, g, k, p, q, t.
31



Semivocales, quod dimidium vocalium potestatis habeant. Hog az 6otiu6knek fel hatalmat biriak. Sunt autem septem: f, 1, m, n, r, s, x.
Liquidae, quod interdum in brevi syllaba liquescant. Hog niha az r6uid egg5 befoglalafban el oluagganak. Et sunt quatuor: 1, m, n, r.
SYLLABA
Syllaba est proprie comprehensio litterarum enunciata. Az Eggbefoglalas femmi nem egeb, hanem az ki mondott betuknek eggbefoglalafa. Syllaba dicitur a Graeco verbo auAAa|i(3di'eiiA quod significat comprehendere, eggbefog10 lalni. Latine connexiones dici possunt. Syllabarum aliae longae, aliae breves, aliae communes.

DICTIO
Dictio est vox articulata cum aliqua significatione, ex qua instruitur oratio, et in quam resolvitur. Az ighe femmi nem egeb, ha nem olF 60 melfet meg irhatnak, QS ualamit iegez, mell' fiobol fiobefiid lifien. QS mell' fioba az 6obe6id 5 efmeglenn el oStatik. Dictionum aliae simplices, aliae compositae. Compositarum item multiplex forma. Exempla ex Donato petat puer.
ORATIO
Oratio est sermo, quae dictionibus constat. Az Jsobefiid femmi nem egeb ha 10 nem olf be§illis mell' ighikb61 uagon.
Partes orationis sunt octo: nomen, pronomen, verbum, adverbium, participium, coniunctio, praepositio, interiectio. New, Newirtualo, Befid, Befiidhezualo, Felrifmiul, Eggbefoglalo, E161 uet6, 15 K6zbeuet6.

20 Quae superioribus ita sunt cognatae, ut ab illis separari nullo modo possint. Orthographia enim litterarum est, prosodia syllabarum, etymologia dictionum, syntaxis orationum. De quibus singulis consilium non est hoc loco agere, sed de orthographia tantum, et quidem quoad eius fieri potest, brevissime. Si quis plura his hac de re desiderat, legat ea, quae secundo tractantur libello.

De vocalium orthographia
REGULA PRIMA
5 Rectam vocalium utriusque ordinis scripturam ex superioribus puer una cum exemplis facile discet.
De consonantium orthographia
REGULA SECUNDA
Hae quinque consonantes C, G, L, N, T, et praepositae et postpositae vo10 calibus, nonnunquam ut peregrino, nescio, quo sono efferuntur, ita litterarum combinationes, figurasque requirunt novas. Verum ut haec facilius assequantur pueri, voces Latinas cum peregrinis coniungemus. Sunt autem hae:
ac ec ic oc uc ca ce ci co cu
acz ecz icz ocz ucz cza cze czi czo czu 15 6cz ucz cz6 czu Aut acz ecz icz ocz ucz cza cze czi czo czu 6cz ucz. cz6 czu

REGULATERTIA
l o Cum Latinus sermo unum tantum S habeat, noster tria, idque iuxta Hebraeae linguae proprietatem. Unum asperius, aliud mollius, tertium quod inter haec medium est. S asperum quidam per sch scribunt, nos facilioris tum scribendi, tum legendi gratia per f simplex, mollius per fs, sic et nos. Tertium item per f simplex sicut et primum illud, nos differentiae causa sic f. Primum genus Heb15 raei o schin dextrum, secundum c samek, tertium ts schin sinistrum vocant.

REGULA QUARTA
Vocales in dictionibus geminari non debent, nisi ubi ratio exigit, ut in his et similibus dictionibus: Abraham, Aaron, Isaac etc. Nec accentuum notis figura25 ri, nisi in perquam paucis locis. Fit enim. ut ibi vocales geminentur, ubi natura erant longae, aut maiore oris gestu efferendae. Dictionum quippe accentum unicuique natura in patrio sermone absque ullis praeceptis suppeditat. Exempla peregrinarum harum vocum copiosa ex libro secundo, quem nominatim huic rei dicavimus, peti cum possint, nullis hic nos usi sumus exemplis.

Accidentia nominis
Nomini accidunt sex: qualitas, comparatio, genus, numerus, figura, casus.
QUALITAS Minemufig
10 Propria, quae est nomen unius. Qualitas in nomine duplex est. Appellativa, quae est nomen multorum.
COMPARATIO Eggbehafonlas
15 Regularis, quae certam sequitur regulam. Comparatio item duplex. Irregularis, quae non.
Gradus comparationis tres: positivus, comparativus et superlativus.
Gradus comparationis formantur in patrio nostro sermone iuxta Hebraeae 20 linguae phrasim addita aut littera, aut particula. Littera apud Hebraeos, quae vicem supplet comparativi, est [j]Q, apud nos b, particula vero eadem apud nos, quae apud illos, et comparativi, et superlativi, nempe "inv magis, inkabb et ~i«c valde ighen, sine quibus gradus nullo modo possunt formari apud nos, aeque ac apud illos. Exempla: albus feijr, albior feijrb, auag inkabb feijr, albissimus fe25 lette ighen feijr. Bonus io, melior iobb auag inkabb io, optimus felette ighen io. Est enim tam regularium, quam irregularium una formatio. Porro ut apud Latinos, ita apud nos diminutionem accipiunt quaedam comparativorum, ut grandiusculus, minusculus, nagubbadka, kufsebbedke.

GENUS Nem
Masculinum, ut hic magister. Femininum, ut haec Musa. 20 Genera nominum sunt quinque. Neutrum, ut hoc scamnum. Commune, ut hic et haec homo. Omne, ut hic et haec et hoc felix.
Sunt, qui hoc nomen, homo et apud Graecos et Latinos existiment masculini tantum generis esse, sub uno tamen genere femininum pariter significare, quod 25 in nostra lingua imprimis utrum esse usus ostendit. Cum enim haec vox patria ember, propria sit virorum, usurpatur tamen interdum et de feminino sexu, addita voce, afBoh, quae sexus distinguat, ut affoii ember. Cui tamen opinioni Graeci reclamant grammatici, similiter et Priscianus, qui communis dicunt esse generis. Quin et apud Hebraeos hominis vocabulum uno exprimitur verbo TO ,

quod tamen sub uno genere femininum quoque significat sexum. Est tamen et apud illos, quod genus distinguat. Nam cum verbum hoc sexum significat virilem, nihil de litteris vocabuli decedit, cum vero femininum, prima in plurali numero amittitur littera, ut r??* homines cTM: mulieres. Porro ut apud Hebraeos 5 duo tantum sunt genera praecipua, ita et apud nos, masculinum scilicet et femininum, quae interdum per hasce particulas him, n6ftin, eme etc. eloquimur.

Mensium, quibus nunc utimur, vocabula subiungere nolui, propterea quod haec rebus non respondent, quae manifestum est nuper esse conficta, ab homine nescio quo. Suspicor tamen aut monachorum aut sacrificulorum esse inven25 tum. Nec semper nostros his mensium appellationibus usos fuisse manifestum est, cum ex aliis, tum ex hoc, quod manent adhuc apud nos quaedam germana mensium vocabula. Ut omittam interim, quod ex his quaedam nostra non sunt,

usu tamen ita recepta, ut peregrinum videantur exuisse sonum, nempe haec: Punk6ft, luan, karaczon. Quemadmodum Itali a re ipsa, nempe a qualitate regionis propriae, sumpto vocabulo, mensibus nomina imposuere, ita et Schytae nostri. Italia calidissima 5 est regio, et propterea imbrifera, contra Schytia frigidissima, et ob eam rem nivifera. Itaque ab imbribus Itali mensium vocabulum traxere, Schytae nostri a nivibus. Id verum esse apud illos ostendunt, September, October, November, December, apud nos ratio vocabuli ho. Dicimus enim Buyt el6 ho. Buyt mas ho, item Punk6ft haua, Iuan haua, karaczon haua etc. Verum posteaquam partim 10 maiorum nostrorum virtute, omni memoria digna, partim et potissimum dei benignitate, mitius nacti sumus coelum, ac Schyticam regionem Pannonica commutavimus, non erat forte ineptum, et vocabuli ho, rationem mutare. Si modo id usus (apud quem est, et vis et norma loquendi) nobis permitteret, ac cum reliquis nationibus, quae omnes fere a Lunae cursu mensem denominant, dice15 re holdnap, et non honap, aut, ut imperiti loquuntur, holnap. Neque enim aliud sunt menses, quam dies Lunares, mense enim Luna cursum suum explet. Porro quae est differentia apud Latinos inter haec duo verba, mensis et cras, ea est apud nos inter holdnap et holnap. Haec quamquam erant minutula, arbitrati tamen sumus non nihil referre, si horum pueri admonerentur, ne unam vocem pro 20 alia in lingua patria usurparent. Et Latini ne voces coincidant, diligentissime vitant. Caeterum, quisquis tandem ille fuit, qui mensibus apud nos nomina imposuit, poterat id aut ab anni partibus commodius facere, unicuique parti suos tribuendo menses exempli gratia. Quemadmodum nunc dicimus, Buyt el6 ho, Buyt mas ho, pro Februario et Martio, sic dicere poteramus, Tel el6, Tel mas, 25 Tel harmad ho. Tauafi el6. TauaS mafod, Tauais harmad ho etc. Aut more Romanorum numerum sequi, apud quos mensis quisque posterior incipit a numero. Dicunt enim Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October etc. sic et nos poteramus, elf6 ho, mafod, harmad, neged etc. Sunt et apud poetas pulcherrimae mensium descriptiones, quae etiam huic rei materiam praestare poterant sufficientem, 30 quas non gravabor hoc loco subiungere.

Ceterum ut hae mensium descriptiones nostrae optime respondent regioni, ita non omnibus. Nec nostros maiores his mensium appellationibus in regione Schytica uti potuisse manifestum est cum ex aliis, tum Ovidio, qui regionis Schyticae, in qua hyems continuatur hyemi, sterilitatem his describit carminibus:
5 Non hic pampinea dulcis latet uva sub umbra, Nec cumulant altos fervida musta lacus.
el
Non ager hic pomum, non dulces educat uvas, Non salices ripa robora monte virent. Etc.
10 Est et in Enchyridio piarum precationum similis quaedam mensium descriptio, versibus endecasyllabicis facta, quam huic loco subiungerem, nisi is libellus iam puerorum manibus passim tereretur. Et haec addidi, non quo novus vellem haberi author, sed ut ostenderem, quid nostri in appellationibus mensium poterant sequi.

Et haec, quibus utimur, circumlocutiones verius sunt, quam vocabula. Proinde cum in ventorum inciderimus nomina, necessitas ipsa nos cogit in interpretando, aut alienis pro nostris uti, aut reliqua quoque ad hunc modum circumloqui; Austrum audio a quibusdam vocari Juhfiel, quemadmo30 dum Circium Forgofiel, a re scilicet ipsa, qui alias 'idTru£ dicitur, quem A.

Pestum Peft. Germanice Ofen Strigonium E6tergum hoc Varadinum Uarad Seghedinum Szeghed K) Cibinium Szeben Tibur
Oropus nunc masculino, nunc feminino genere invenitur. Sunt etiam urbium nomina, quae pluralis tantum sunt numeri, ut Athenae, Thebae, Quinqueecclesiae. Quinqueecclesiam usurpavit Guarinus Veronensis in carminibus ad Ioan15 nem Pannonium scriptis:
Hinc urbs pontificem te Quinquecclesia cepit,
metri scilicet coactus necessitate. Observandum est hoc in loco, omnes fere urbes ac oppida Hungariae nostrae Latinis carere vocabulis. Et quae Latina videntur habere, a peregrina sunt om20 nia fere deducta voce. Ab Ister et Gum (ut quidam putant) Efitergum, et ab hac rursum Strigonium, a Uarad Varadinum, a Szeghed Seghedinum, a Peft Pestum, a Uacz Vacia, a Bacz Bacia, a Gewr (ne omnes recenseam urbes) Gewrinum. Sic enim huius urbis nomen in antiquis regum diplomatibus invenitur scriptum, nunc Iaurinum et scribitur et profertur. Non inutilem itaque operam sumpserit, 25 si quis aut vera urbium nostrarum vocabula exquirat, aut quae dignis carent appellationibus nova imponat. Qua in re, si non alia, haec certe non parva erat incommoditas, quod urbium quibusdam vocabulis, cum ipso sint prope tremenda sono, cum volumus uti non possumus. Neque id novum debet videri. Constat enim quaedam urbium vocabula et olim fuisse immutata. Urbs quae nunc 30 Roma, olim Valentia dicta; quae prius Maleventum, post Beneventum vocari cepta; quemadmodum quae ante Bizantium, nunc Constantinopolis. Urbibus ceterarum regionum nomina partim Graeca, partim Latina voce sunt imposita,

id quod et nostri sequi poterant. Graeca sunt Roma, Basilea, Constantinopolis etc. Latina Florentia, Argentina, Constantia etc. Quia vero difficile est usum diu receptum antiquare, poterat uti vulgus imperitum vocabulis a se impositis seque dignis; reliquos quis prohibuerit veris uti urbium vocabulis? Buda met5 ropolis est Hungariae nostrae, inter omnes Europae urbes amoenissimo, simul et commodissimo sita loco, quam cur Germani nostri sua lingua Ofen vocent, nondum plane intelligo, cum alia sit urbs Peft, alia Buda. Est oppidum in ea patriae nostrae ora quam Meggefalfa vocant, ditione magnifici domini Domini Ioannis a Peren mihi gratiosissimi subiectum septem amoenissimis collibus, et 10 illis quidem vitiferis, conspicuum, agri fertilitate laetum, pascuis pingue, campis ac pratis floridum, fontibus ac fluminibus irriguum, sylvis caeduis, simul et intactis amoenissimum, fructibus omnigenis arborum fertile, auro, argento, sale dives, ubi ipse huius lucis hausi primordia, et cui me totum debeo. Szihirvaralfa a nostris dictum, quod a re ipsa nempe quod septem subiaceat collibus, Graeca 15 compositione Heptoropolis, commodius appellari poterat, cuius patriae, alioqui dulcis, vocabulum, quo minus in scriptis meis usurpare possim, eius fit asperitate. Neque enim pudet me patriae, non prorsus humilis, cui etsi ipse iusto nequeam ornamento esse, ipsa tamen mihi dedecori non potest esse. Poteram autem postremo hoc vocabulo commodissime uti, si mihi id per quosdam lice20 ret. Est ab hac patria nostra urbs, tria distans miliaria, opibus, situ, aedificiis, optimis civibus inclyta, quam nostri Rivulum dominarum vocant, quod vocabulum Germani nostri aspernati, eam rectius Neapolim, hoc est Novam civitatem appellant. Quae etiam a re ipsa, nimirum a venis auri et argenti ibi repertis Arrugiae vocabulo dignari poterat, quae vox idem fere significat, quod in nostro 25 sermone Baha, ut intelligas hanc urbem nostros vero vocare nomine. Szighet oppidum est arci, quam vocant Sarwar, adiacens, ubi primum divinam hanc imprimendi artem opera quidem et impensa principis nostri, magnifici domini Domini Thomae a Nadasd, comitis ac bani, ministerio vero etiam nostro in Hungaria nostra excolere cepimus, et unde haec rudimenta in usum iuventutis qualemcun30 que emissimus. A re ita dictum, quod duobus fluminibus, quorum alteri Rabae, alteri Gemmeo nomen est, circumfunditur, nobis Neanesus dicitur, quod hoc princeps ipse in novam redegit formam. Primum quidem illud fossa et vallo ita muniendo, ut ne furori quidem Turcae anno 1532 obsidentis patuerit. Nam clade accepta ab hoc discedere coactus est. Deinde flumina retando, mox densissimae 35 sylvae, huic imminentis, arbores lucando, et huius locum hortis amoenissimis ac pomariis consecrando. Postremo ludum litterarium opere latericio in hoc extruendo. Ad hunc modum et reliquis urbibus nostris sua poterant reddi vocabula. Verum non deerunt, certo scio, qui haec quoque rideant. Ridenda tamen non erant, in quibus constat et magnos viros operam suam locasse. Nam et Stephani 40 de urbibus nobilissimum extat opus. Et quidam nostro etiam seculo ad exemplum

huius non contemnendum opus edidit, in quo et nostrae Hungariae urbium non paucarum meminit.
ARBORUM

Masculina sunt haec: oleaster, rubus, dumus, spinus, authore Servio. Siler neutrum est. Reperitur et ficus interdum masculino genere. Oleaster Cicero in 10 feminino videtur protulisse Actionis in Verrem 5. Hominem, inquit, corripi ac suspendi iussit in oleastro quadam etc. Verum ibi oleaster ad arborem refertur, ut sequentia satis indicant. Multae sunt arbores, quarum Hungaria nostra ferax est, multae, quarum non. Tantum autem abest, ut omnium arborum nostro sermone habeamus vocabu15 lum, ut in nostrae quoque regionis arborum vocabulis laboremus. Quod de arboribus dico, idem de aliis rebus, herbis, lapidibus, gemmis etc sentiendum. Mec soli nos, sed et aliae gentes, cum quibus (si Celso credimus) et Graeci, ne sit, ut quis ex nostris ob hoc ipsum sibi ipsi displiceat.
TERTIA REGULA

Reliquas tum generales, tum speciales commodius pueri discent ex aliis, maxime iis, qui eas carmine sunt complexi, inter quos sunt ex recentioribus Sulpitius et Lilius.

De numeris REGULA PRIMA
Et hic animadvertat puer patrii nostri sermonis phrasim esse, ut nominibus pluralis numeri utantur interdum aeque ac singularibus, tum scilicet cum no5 minibus numeralibus, aut per se multitudinem significantibus nomina adduntur pluralis numeri. Cum enim huiusmodi nomina per se satis distinguant numerum, ad rem, non verba respicientes, satis ducimus id altero significasse verbo. Sicut enim efferimus unus homo, sic duo, tres, decem, centum, mille homines. Egg ember, ket ember, harom ember, tiz ember,fiazember, ezer ember. Quod si 10 his iuxta Latinis sermonis proprietatem uti voles orationibus, unus homo, duo homines, tres homines. Egg ember, ket emberek, harom emberek etc. in patrii sermonis peccas proprietatem. Sua est uniuscuiusque linguae phrasis, quam qui in linguis diligenter non observant, dum aliquid interpretandum suscipiunt in primo statim (ut in proverbio est) limine solent impingere, ac monstro quid 15 simile edent. Sed ut res fiat manifestior, exemplis quoque id ostendemus sequentibus: Duo homines ascendebant in templum, ket ember megen uala fel az templumba. Domine decem talenta tradidisti mihi, Uram tiz talentot adal ennekem. Si quis habent centum oves, Ha kinek 6az iuha uagon. Porro qui comederant, erant quinquies mille, Touabba az kik uttenek uala, 6t ezerenn ualanak. 20 Multi sunt vocati, pauci vero electi, Sok az hiuatalos, keues az ualafitott auag, fokann uadnak az hiuatalofok keuefenn uadnak az ualafitottak. Nec dicimus fokak az hiuatalofok, keuefek az ualafitottak, ut verba ipsa Latina sonant.

De articulo Hungarici sermonis
10 Philippus Melanchthon praeceptor noster scribens in Grammatica sua Graeca de Graeci sermonis articulis, primum Priscianum sequutus Latinam linguam articulum habere negat, grammaticosque Latinos nominem casibus hic, haec, hoc, docendi gratia addidisse, non quod sermo Latinus hos nosset articulos. Deinde Germanicam linguam aeque ac Graecam articulum habere. Ubi etiam 15 hoc addit neminem posse vim articulorum Graeci sermonis exacte cognoscere, nisi ex Germanico idiomate. Quae verba Philippi cum plerique sinistre interpretentur, sentio illum de suae tantum gentis hominibus loqui, quibus praecipue illa tradebat rudimenta, et quorum linguae proprietatem probe noverat. Non etiam reliquarum nationum, quarum (licet sit ille TToAiryAoaaoc) ut linguas non 20 novit, ita de his pronunciare non poterat. Neque enim adduci possum, ut credam Philippum (quamvis tum, cum illa scriberet, admodum iuvenem), aut sui fuisse oblitum, ut quid scriberet, nesciret, aut studio, quod erga suam gentem habebat, lapsum. Nihil enim dici poterat absurdius, si haec ita accipiantur, ut sentiat nullam orbis terrae nationum linguam habere articulum, nisi Germanicam et 25 Graecam. Habet enim et sermo noster Hungaricus, perinde ac Graecus. Nam de ceterarum gentium linguis iudicare nequeo. Articulus est in nostro sermone particula, Az, omnium generum et numerorum, quae inflecti nescit. Nam quae inflectitur, pronomen est. Minima quidem illa, sed quae magnam orationi addat tum maiestatem, tum splendorem, si quis illa recte utatur. Quemadmodum in 30 Graeco, sic in nostro sermone suus articulo est locus. In tenuique labor est, at gloria non tenuis. Hic in sacris litteris non loco addirus, aut loco detractus (ut vere Chrysostomus et Augustinus senserunt) sensum facit aut orthodoxum aut haereticum. Sed ut praedicta facilius assequantur pueri, sequens placuit subicere exemplum.

continuo tamen illius errori patrocinandum est, quin potius remedium illi quaerendum. Deinde quoque particulae ab, ac, ad, af etc. in nostro sermone omni prorsum carent significatione, praesertim extra compositionem. Nam in Latino praepositiones sunt, ut abbrevio, acclamo, affero, aggravo, allevo etc. pro ad5 brevio, adclamo, adfero, adgravo, adlevo etc. Postremo, quod in omni fere lingua est quaedam in pronunciando varietas, ratio tamen orthographiae apud omnes certa est. Hebraei scribunt rrjrr et;", proferunt autem non quod verba ipsa sonant, sed aliud quiddam. Graeci "ayyeAo?, a4>iy£, 'eyxeipi8iou, pronunciant autem angelos, sphinx, enchiridion. Latini, Quintiliano teste, quasdam litteras 10 scribunt quidem, parum tamen exprimunt, non eximunt, sed tantum in pronunciando obscurant. Et nunc Itali multa secus pronunciant, rum in Latino, tum in vernaculo sermone, quam litteris notent. Germanos nostros audio ab illis, qui huius linguae periti sunt, idem facere. Horum exemplo et apud nos, etsi sunt, qui pronuncient ab barat, af farkas, ap pap, ad diak etc. Articuli tamen extrema 15 littera perpetuo scribenda est per z, non alias consonantes, ut ratio orthographiae constet apud nos aeque ac apud ceteras nationes. Neque enim video, quid obstet, quo minus praedictae voces per hoc litterarum genus et scribantur et proferantur. Illud manifestius est, quam ut negari possit, esse in nostra etiam lingua, ut in aliarum gentium, litterarum transmutationes, de quibus in sequen20 tibus non nihil attingemus, cum de infiexionibus orationis partium agere coepimus, in quibus potissimum haec usu venire solet transmutatio. Az particula cum inflectitur, ut initio dixi, pronomen est, non articulus, in cuius inflexione extrema littera z aliquoties in aliam transit litteram, ut in capite de pronomine videbimus. Nunc quae ad nominum pertinent, inflexiones trademus, in quibus 25 suus cuique casui est articulus.
DECLINATIO Haytogatas
Prima, els6. Secunda, masod. 30 Declinationes in nomine sunt quinque. Tertia, harmad. Quarta, neged. Quinta, 6t6d.
Primum noster sermo unam tantum novit nominum omnis generis inflexionem. Deinde, sicut apud Hebraeos, sic apud nos casus certis distinguuntur litte35 ris et syllabis, hoc tamen nostra declinatio ab illorum differt declinandi ratione, quod illi litteras ad casuum adiciunt principia, nos ad finem. Postremo, ut apud illos, nominativus nullis distinguitur litteris, sic etiam apud nos, genitivi singularis littera significativa est e_, dativi k, accusativi t, vocativi eadem, quae nominativi, ablativi 1. Nominativi pluralis k, reliquorum eadem, quae fuerant
54



singularium, facile autem puer distinguere poterit numerum, si ad litteram k respiciat, cui reliquorum casuum litterae semper subiciuntur. Hic tamen notandum, quod nominativus pluralis pro k i litteram habebit, si aliis nominum casibus addatur, nominativi vel singularis k pluralis, ut Videntes filii dei filias 5 hominum, Latuann az iftennek fiai az embereknek leahit etc. Hae praedictae litterae tametsi certissime sint casuum notae, videntur tamen casus varias habere litteras, cum non habeant, idque multis causis usu evenire solet. Primo ratione constructionis. Alia est enim ratio syntaxeos nostrae linguae, alia Latinae. Non semper iisdem casibus oratio absolvitur in nostro 10 sermone, quibus in Latino. In hoc enim, ut paucis quibusdam utar exemplis, alterum duorum substantivorum nominem coniunctim positorum ponitur in genitivo possessionem significante, in illo in dativo acquisitionem denotante. Filius hominis dicunt Latini, nos filius homini, az embernek fia. Nec dicimus iuxta Latinae linguae phrasim az embere. fiu, in genitivo possessionem notante. Quod 15 si possessionem significare volumus, dicimus ez fiu ez embere^. Sic coniunctim nunquam duobus utimur ablativis in oratione patria, sed pro altero alterum usurpamus casum, aut eum, qui Latinis erat nominativus, aut accusativus, aut alius quispiam ex ceteris. Nominativum usurpamus in hac et similibus: Herode regnante, az Herodes orfiagot biruann. Accusativum in hac et huic simili: Men20 dicato pascitur ille cibo, kuldult eledeluel il. Qua forma loquendi, si seiunctim utamur, Latinos imitari possumus, eledeluel il de kuldultual az az melfet kuldultanak. Quaedam orationes usu formam induerunt Latinam, verbum metuo in Latino sermone nunc accusativum requirit casum, ut metuo te, nunc dativum, ut metuo tibi, in nostro sermone autem ablativum cum praepositione aut accusati25 vum. Exemplum primi fuerit, filek te tuled. Exemplum secundi, filtelek tighedet. Vitiose itaque loquuntur, qui dicunt fillek tighedet, aut filek teneked. Quod de his orationibus sentio, idem de multis aliis iudica. Secundo ratione pronominum separatorum, ut pater noster, anima nostra: rnu atank, mu lelkunk. Neque enim dicimus mienk at'a, mienk lilek, ut verba ipsa Latina sonant etc. Tertio 30 ratione pronominum affixorum, ut monachus factus, scholasticus factus, dives factus. Baratta, diakka, kazdagga lun. In quibus orationibus extrema nominativi littera geminatur, ut vides, et illi a rectum nota nimirum pronominum affixorum additur, de quibus suo loco copiosius. Nominativi erant seiunctim barat, diak, kazdag. Quarto nominum derivativorum, ut divina sapientia, humana stultitia. 35 Ifteni b61czefig, emberi balgatagfag etc. Et hic ad extremam nominativi litteram i apponitur nota nimirum nominum derivativorum. Nominativi erat seorsum positi Iften, ember etc. Quinto ratione participiorum, ut Videns autem phariseus, latuann az fariseus. Videntes magi stellam, latuann az czillagot az b61czek. Herode regnante, az Herodes orfiagot biruann. Sexto ratione praepositionum, cum 40 enim praepositiones fini adiciantur casuum in patrio nostro sermone, non prin

cipio, ut verius postpositiones eas appellare debeamus, quam praepositiones. Varietati materiam interdum ministrant, idque in accusativo magis, quam ablativo, quamquam et in hoc. Exemplum primi: In domo, az hazban. In agro, az mez6nn. In templo, az templumban. Exemplum secundi: A nobis, mu tullunk. 5 A vobis, tu tulletek. Ab illis, u tull6k etc. Ex his similibus dicendi formis facile datur intelligi tota via totoque coelo errare illos, qui nil putant inter patriae nostrae et Latinae linguae constructionem differe, quique in interpretando genus omne orationis ad Latinae linguae loquendi formam exigunt. Quamvis in quibusdam loquendi formulis communicemus cum illis, tamen pars ea non est 10 centesima pro his, quibus ab illis variamus. Id verum esse intelliget quisquis ad linguarum proprietates diligenter respiciat, quod omnino faciendum est iis, qui e studiorum suorum messe copiosa non inanes culmos aut leves stipulas, sed ipsissimam frugem colligere volent. Verum quotus quisque est, qui id praestet. Nam is demum doctissimus omnium habetur, qui quam plurima edat, non qui 15 quam optima. Sed iam nos ad id, quod consectaneum est, veniamus.

Iure igitur haec Donatus pronomina vocat articularia. Quia vero utilissimum est iuxta Diomedis grammatici praeceptum pueros per chrias exercere, ut hoc exercitii genere doctrinas casuum in orationibus facilius possint animadvertere, huius rei hoc sit exemplum.

Affixa dicuntur, quae dictionibus sic cohaerent, ut seorsum stare non possint. Separata vocantur, quae in orationis contextu per se stare possunt, nec faciunt unum cum alia dictione corpus. Adhaerent autem affixa nominibus et verbis. Affixorum cum nominibus notae sunt in patria nostra 10 lingua primum vocales, et rectae et obliquae. Deinde consonantes M, D, et C, et cum his syllabae quaedam. Cum verbis praeter vocales praedictas I, M, D, L et syllabae quaedam, de quibus ordine exempla tradens, ac primum de affixis cum nominibus.

Si nominis postrema littera vocalis fuerit, ipsa non geminatur, sed illi affixum simpliciter additur. 25 Exemplum:iudex factus, biroa lun; Iudaeus factus, Cidoa liin; adoptavit in filium, fiua fogada etc. Excipe ab hac regula sequens orationis genus: embernek fia. Neque enim dicimus embernek fiua, iuxta regulam prius a nobis positam.

SECUNDA REGULA
Si nominis extrema littera consona fuerit, interdum ipsa geminatur, et illi affixum additur pronomen, interdum vero non geminatur. Exemplum primi: att'a, ahha. batfa, iiccze, item pappa, baratta. deakka 5 lun etc. Exemplum secundi: ipa, napa, sue, huga. Nomina erant seorsum posita. At'. ah, baf hcz, pap, barat, deak. Ip, nap, su, hug etc. Hactenus quomodo affixa pronomina nominibus adhaereant diximus, nunc quo pacto eadem verbis addantur, ostendemus.

Quae res manifestissime ostendit magnam nostrae linguae cum sacra illa Hebraea esse affinitatem. Ut autem id cunctis sit mani5 festum, nostram linguam cum Hebraea quoque coniungemus.

15 Pronomini accidunt sex: qualitas, genus, numerus, figura, persona, casus.
QUALITAS
Qualitates pronominum sunt tres: finita, infinita, minusque finita. Finita, quae certum notat numerum et orationem dirigit ad certam personam, ut ego, en. 20 Infinita est, quae certam non recipit personam, ut quis, quae, kiczoda; quod, miczoda. Minusque finita est, quae certis et incertis personis aptari potest, ut ipse, u.
GENUS
Genera pronominum sunt quatuor: masculinum, ut hic; femininum, ut haec; 25 neutrum, ut hoc, ez; commune, ut ego, en; tu, te. Diximus supra, cum de articulo nostri sermonis ageremus, particulam az articulum esse, qui omnia complecteretur genera et numero. Hic rursum admonendi sunt pueri particulas amaz, ez pronomina esse, quae ad omnia referantur genera masculinum, foemininum et neutrum, idque contra Hebraei, Graeci, pa30 riter et Latini sermonis proprietatem. Dicimus enim: ille homo, amaz ember; illa mulier, amaz affioii ember; illud ens, amaz allat; hic homo, ez ember; haec mulier, ez aHioh ember; hoc ens, ez allat.
69



NUMERUS
Numeri pronominum sunt duo: singularis, ut ego, en; pluralis, ut nos, mu.
FIGURA
Figurae pronominum sunt duae: simplex, ut quis, kiczoda; composita, ut 5 quis-quis, ualakiczoda.
PERSONA
Personae pronominum sunt tres: prima, ut ego, en; secunda, ut tu, te; tertia, ut ille, amaz.
CASUS
10 Casus pronominum sunt sex, ut et nominum: nominativus, genitivus, dativus, accusativus, vocativus, ablativus. Observet puer, ut nomina, ita pronomina quaedam esse, quae vocativum non habeant. Cum autem vocativus usurpatur, id fieri per adverbium. Ceterum, quae de nominum inflexionibus tradidimus, hic quoque locum habent. Pauci enim 15 sunt pronominum casus, qui a nominum in nostro sermone varient casibus. Id uno aut altero paradigmate pueris demonstrasse sufficiat, quos volumus absolutam pronominum inflexionem ex Donato petere. Divisimus autem pronomina in duas classes, quo facilius pueri unumquodque pronomen eiusdem formae in suo ordine discant inflectere, quod fieri in turba non poterat.
20 DECLINATIO
Declinationes in pronomine sunt quattuor.
PRIMA DECLINATIO
Est, quae mittit genitivum singularem in i vel is, et dativum in i, ut ego, mei, vel mis, mihi. Et huius ordinis pronomina sunt tria: ego, tu, sui.
70



SECUNDA DECLINATIO
Est, quae mittit genitivum singularem in ius, et dativum in i, ut ille, illius, illi. Et huius ordinis pronomina sunt quinque, scilicet: ille, ipse, iste, hic, is.
TERTIA DECLINATIO
Est, quae mittit genitivum singularem in i, et dativum in o, ut meus, mei, meo; vel meum, mei, meo, aut in ae diphthongon, et dativum similiter, ut mea, meae, meae. Et huius ordinis sunt quinque pronomina: meus, tuus, suus, noster, vester.
QUARTA DECLINATIO
10 Est, quae mittit genitivum singularem in atis, et dativum in ati, ut nostras, nostratis, nostrati; vestras, vestratis, vestrati. Cuius ordinis pronominum sunt duo: nostras et vestras.

QUALITAS
10 Qualitas verborum est in modis et formis.
MODI
Modi sunt quinque. Indicativus, mutato, ut lego, oluafok. Imperativus, paranczolo, ut lege, oluafs. Optativus, kiuano, ut utinam legerem, vayha oluafnik. Coniunctivus, eggbe foglalo, ut cum legam, mikoronn oluafsak. Infinitivus, 15 vighezis nelkul ualo, ut legere, oluafni.
FORMAE
Formae verborum sunt quattuor. Perfecta, el uighezett, ut lego, oluafok. Meditativa, gondolkodo, ut lecturio, oluafni gondolkodom. Frequentativa, gakorlo, ut lectito, gakorta oluafok. Inchoativa, kezdis tiu6, ut fervesco, megkezdek 20 heuulni; calesco, megkezdek meleghedni.
CONIUGATIO
Donatus distinxit coniugationes litteris et syllabis per secundas personas praesentis indicativi singularis numeri, qui enim ob hoc ipsum obscurior est, quam ut a pueris commode possit intelligi, atque coniugationes et genera con25 fbndit. Propterea nos coniugationes ad puerorum captum distinximus.

Coniugationes verborum sunt quattuor.
PRIMA est in A productam.
SECUNDA 5 est in E productam.
TERTIA est in E vel I correptam.
QUARTA est in I productam.

sit prima coniugatio, quae in indicativo modo, numero singulari, tempore praeterito perfecto, tertia persona in A rectum exit. Secunda, quae in eodem modo, numero, tempore indefinito, tertia persona in A obliquum desinit. Tertia, quae in eodem modo, numero, tempore, persona in E. rectum. Quarta, quae item in 5 eodem modo, numero, tempore, persona in E obliquum. Paradigmata primae coniugationis possunt sumi ex his et similibus verbis: praecipit, iussit, benedixit, maledixit, ut Praecipit Deus Moysi, Azt paranczola az Iften Moifefnek, azt haga. Benedixit Deus Noe, Meg alda az iften Noet. Maledixit Deus Caim, Meg atkoza az Iften Kaimot etc. 10 Secundae ex his: reliquit, dixit etc, ut Reliquit me febris, El haga enghemet az hideglelifnek betegfighe. Kai etuev 6 Qeos, Dixit Deus, £s monda az Iften. Huic orationi si particulam azt addideris, primam facies coniugationem, azt monda. Contra, si aliam addideris nempe hanc, Ug, extrema vocalis verbi erit A obliquum non rectum. Ug monda hog etc. Idem fit in superiori quoque ver15 bo, ut Reliquit eam febris, El haga utet az hideglelifnek betegfighe, sicut apud Hebraeos, Graecos et Latinos fit transitus ab una coniugatione ad aliam, addita vel detracta aut littera aut syllaba, ut ips ips] ips: ips; visitavit, visitatus sum, visitatus sum, visitavit; TUTTTUJ, TUTTTO|iat, Timro|iai, TUTTTUJ; verbero, verberor, verberor, verbero. 20 Tertiae ex his: creavit, fecit, genuit etc. In principio creavit Deus coelum et terram, Ez uilagnak kezdetiben teremtQ az Iften az eghet e_s az f61det. Abraham autem genuit Isaac, Abraham kediglenn nemze. Ifaakot etc. Quartae ex his: tulit, qaesivit etc. Multa tulit fecitque puer, Sokatfienuedee_s tun germekfighiben. Quaesivit lanam et linum, gapiut QS lent kerefe etc.
7 Praecipit Deus Moysi... In the Vulgate: Constituit Dominus Moysi (Bar 1. 20.) 8 Benedixit Deus Noe... In the Vulgate: Benedixitque Deus Noe (Gen 9. 1.) Maledixit Deus Caim... In the Vulgate: it does not occur with these words. 10 Reliquit me febris... - in marg.: Math. 8. In the Vulgate: dimisit eam febris (Mt 8. 15.) In Erasmus's works:. reliquit illam febris (Mt 8. 15.) 11 Kai. e'mev 6 Geoj... - in marg.: Genesis 1.

In Erasmus's works: Abraham genuit Isaac (Mt 1. 2.) The insertion of "autem" occurs in the continuation of the quoted place. In the Vulgate: Abraham genuit Isaac Isaac autem genuit Iacob Iacob autem genuit ludam et fratres eius (Mt 1. 2.) In Erasmus's works: Abraham genuit Isaac Isaac autem genuit lacob Iacob autem genuit Iudam, et fratres eius (Mt 1.2.) 24 Quaesivit lanam et linum... Prov 31. 13.

Est et coniugatio apud Hebraeos, quam illi Hiffil vocant, qua noster sermo creberrime utitur. Quae cum multas habeat species, haec inter alias praecipua est, quae habet verba, quorum significatio tres in se personas includit. Prima est, a qua agendi origo exit; secunda, cuius medio operatio perficitur; tertia, 5 in quam illa transit. Huius coniugationis usum, cum Graecus et Latinus ignoret sermo, exempla de hac in Graeca et Latina lingua dari nequeunt, nisi per circumlocutione. Quorum tamen verborum huius ordinis germanam significationem sermo noster Hungaricus, perinde ac Hebraeus, uno commodissime exprimit verbo ^ « n , comedere fecit; itete^, itete; fecit occidere, meg oletQ, meg 10 olete; fecit sanare, meg gogijtata, meg gogijtata. Quae verba, ut vides, iuxta alium atque alium orationis tenorem in nostra lingua in omnes ordines possunt referri. Alia enim formativas litteras habent rectas, alia obliquas. Meg gogijtata utet, primi ordinis est. Meg gogijtata enghemet, secundi. Meg olete. utet, tertii. Meg olete enghemet, quarti. Ex ordine eorum verborum est, quod Hiffil ab 15 Hebraeis diximus vocari, et hoc sequens ]"TKn, filele, quod quidam uno volens reddere verbo, aurisavit dixit. Cuius verbi vim cum Latinus sermo uno verbo exprimere commode nequeat, noster commodissime. Dicimus enim: Mit filelfi? Nagonn foga filelni etc. Circumlocutione enim Latini utuntur, cum dicunt obsidere aures.
20 G E N U S
Activum Passivum Genera verborum sunt quinque. Neutrum Deponens 25 Commune
Activum verbum est, quod desinit in o, et accepta r litteram format ex se passivum, ut lego, oluafom; legor, oluaftatom. Passivum verbum est, quod desinit in r, qua detracta redit rursus in activum, ut amor, fierettetem; amo, fieretem. 30 Passiva verba et communia in nostro idiomate aucta una littera et syllaba, iuxta Graeci sermonis usum exeunt, ut amo, fieretem; amor, fierettetem. Doceo, tanijtom; doceor, tanijtatom. Criminor illum, buntetem azt; criminor ab illo, buntettetem attul. Neutrum est, quod in o desinit, ut activum, cui si r littera accedat, Latinum 35 non est, ut sedeo, ul6k. Neutropassivum dicitur, quod partim neutri, partim passivi generis vocem habeat, ut gaudeo, 6rul6k; gaudes, 6rul6; gavisus sum, 6rulik. Deponens est, quod in r desinit, ut passivum, sed ea dempta, desinit esse Latinum, ut loquor, 6olok; sequor, k6uetek.
83



Commune est, quod in r desinit, ut passivum, et tum agentis, tum patientis in se includit significatione, ut criminor te, buntetlek tighedet; criminor a te, buntettetem te tuled.
NUMERUS
5 Numeri verborum sunt duo. Singularis, ut lego, oluafok. Pluralis, ut legimus, oluafunk.
FIGURA
Figurae verborum sunt duae. Simplex, ut lego, oluafom. Composita, ut relego, megoluafom.

CONIUGATIO
In verborum coniugationibus diligenter observet puer: verba in patrio nostro 20 sermone iuxta aliam atque aliam orationis constructionem varie inflecti. Idque usu venire solet in verbis dumtaxat activis, non tamen in omnibus modis et temporibus. Nam verbum faciam diligi, fierettetlek ad Hiffil pertinet. Si ergo verbum sumas aut absolute aut transitive, iuxta variam eius cum aliis partibus syntaxim, propriam sibi et ab aliis eiusdem ordinis verbis diversam habebit in25 flexionem. Contingit autem id contra Gracae et Latinae linguae usum, nec id in una aut altera coniugatione, sed in omnibus. Nam hac quoque in re nostra lin

gua ad Hebraeam proxime accedit, in qua nominum et verborum inflexionibus pronomina adhibentur affixa, ratione quorum haec coniugandi in nostro sermone accidit varietas. Porro ut in nominum inflexionibus certae sunt litterae, quae vicem supplent affixorum pronominis, ita et in verborum coniugationibus, ut 5 supra in capitulo de pronomine ostendi. Ut autem res fiat dilucidior, de singulis ordine ponam paradigmata.
Amo absolute acceptum sic coniugatur.
amo geretek amamus fieretunk amas liereccz amatis Serettek 10 amat fieret amant fieretnek
Reliqua quoque eodem modo.
Idem verbum si construatur cum accusativo pronominis secundae personae, 1 litteram ante ultimam verbi asciscit syllabam, quae haud dubie affixorum pronominum vim obtinet.
15 amo te fieretlek amamus fieretunk amas fiereccz amatis fierettek amat fieret amant fieretnek

Nam quod superius diximus, nostrum sermonem vel citra personarum adiunctionem satis exprimere personas, id in verbis quoque huius ordinis verum est. Cum enim dico: Szeretlek, aut iseretem, etiamsi nihil amplius addam, significantissime loquor. Includunt enim haec verba in se personas, quae sunt pronominum affixorum. Quia vero haec tanta varietas confusionem parere poterat, distinximus verba in suos ordines. Primus est absolutorum. Secundus transitivorum. Tertius passivorum. Quartus defectivorum.

<V. ADVERBIUM>
ADVERBIUM est pars orationis, quae adiecta verbo significationem eius explanat atque implet. Az Befiidhez ualo azfiobefiidnekegg rifie mell' az Befiidhez uettetuinn az ij ieccziflt iobbann ki magarazza QS be t61ti.
5 Accidentia adverbii
Adverbio accidunt tria: significatio, comparatio et figura.
<SIGNIFICATIO>
SIGNIFICATIONUM adverbiorum species puer ex Donato petat. Particula penig adverbium est optandi in nostro sermone, qua pro autem, kedig vel ke10 diglenn (utroque enim modo loquimur) vulgus imperitum solet uti. Dicimus enim: opto, quod adveneris; penig el iuttel etc. Neque enim est adverbium huius ordinis apud Latinos, quo nativam huius particulae significationem exprimere possis. Quemadmodum enim apud Latinos sunt quaedam particulae indeclinabilium orationis partium, quae apud nos voce carent; ita et contra sunt in nostra 15 lingua, quae Latinam vocem non habent.
COMPARATIO
Adverbia comparantur tribus gradibus comparationis. Positivo, ut docte, b61czenn. Comparativo, ut doctius, b61czebbenn. Superlativo, ut doctissime, annal e_s b61czebbenn, auag ighen b61czenn.
20 FIGURA
Adverbiorum figurae sunt duae. Simplex, ut prudenter, b61czenn. <Composita, ut> Imprudenter, b61czefig nelkul.
112



<VI. PARTICIPIUM>
PARTICIPIUM est pars orationis partem capiens nominis et verbis. Recipit enim a nomine genera et casus, a verbo autem tempora et significationes, ab utroque numerum et figuram. Az felriS uiu6 az fiobefiidnek eggik rifie mell' az 5 Newnek e_s az Ighinek egg rifiit uiSi el. Mert az Newtul Nemet e.s Efetet uifien az Ighitul kediglenn ud6kot QS Iecczifeket. Mind az kettdtul Szamot QS Abrazatot.
Accidentia participii
Participio accidunt sex, quae genus, casus, tempus, significatio, numerus et 10 figura.
GENUS
Genera participiorum sunt quattuor: masculinum, ut hic lectus; femininum, ut haec lecta; neutrum, ut hoc lectum; omne, ut hic et haec et hoc legens, irafoluafo.
15 CASUS
Casus participiorum sunt sex: nominativus, genitivus, dativus, accusativus, vocativus, ablativus.
TEMPUS
Tempora participiorum sunt tria: praesens, praeteritum et futurum.
20 SIGNIFICATIO
Significationes participiorum trahunt a verbis, a quibus descendunt. Alia est enim significatio activa, alia passiva, alia neutra, alia deponens, alia communis. Activam significationem habent participia, quae a verbis activis descendunt. Passivam, quae a passivis. Neutram, quae a neutris etc. De quibus Donatus co25 piose.

Complexi sumus eam grammaticae partem, quae declinabiles orationis continet partes, in qua adeo nihil est, ut quisquam in nostra desideret lingua, ut hoc ipso, quod ad inflexiones attinet et nominum et verborum, omnes omnium linguas facile exsuperet. Est enim regulatissima, ut vocant, non minus, quam 5 una ex primariis illis Hebraea, Graeca et Latina. Quo iniquior sum illis, qui hanc utpote indignam, qua homines utantur, non contempserunt modo, verum etiam linguam linguae virulentia conspurcare veriti non sunt. Qua re non nobis solum, verum etiam Deo, qui linguarum autor est, iniuriam intulere. Et hac YAioTTouaxLav in se, indignissime diu nostra lingua pertulit, quam nostri ab 10 hac virulenta violentia facile potuissent tueri, si modo eius defensionem voluissent suscipere. Quid enim indignius Christianis maxime, quam omisso vero linguae usu, serpentium in morem linguas in linguam, nihil commeritam, acuere, ac venenum, quod mox in illam evomas, sub labiis occultare? Quin et nobis non secus accidit, quam illis, qui ingentem intra parietes privatos thesaurum 15 reconditum habent quidem, verum illo, licet sint tenuis fortunae, frui nequeunt, cum ignorent, ubi locorum sit defossus. Habuimus thesaurum hunc linguae patriae hactenus absconditum, quem nunc primum repertum eruimus, in lucemque proferimus, quo si frui non recusaverimus, brevi (ut spero et opto) ex inopibus divites evademus abunde. Nescio enim, qui fit, ut nobis nostra etiam praeclara 20 quaeque interdum sordeant, cum aliis gentibus sua etiam humilia placeant arrideantque. Hoc re ipsa indignum sane erat, illud, quis non summe detestetur, quod interdum non solum nostram negligimus linguam et alienam discimus, sed eas etiam, quibus omnes bonae litterae sunt proditae.

POTESTAS
Potestatis coniunctionum quinque species. Sunt enim aut copulativae, aut disiunctivae, aut expletivae, aut causales, aut rationales, ut in Donato. l o Copulativa coniunctio est in nostro sermone e_s, qua et in scribendo, et quoque in pronunciando quidam vitiose utuntur. Nunc enim primam huius partis orationis litteram nempe Q absorbent, nunc i mutant. Exemplum primi fuerit: Respondit et dixit, Felele Tmonda. Secundi: Ite et vos in vineam meam, Mennetek el tu is. Scribendum enim est et proferendum: felele QS monda. Item Mehhetek el tu ef. Quod si 15 ob crebrum vocalium concursum praedictam litteram Q in pronunciando obscurare voluimus, optimum erit Graecorum more id per apostrophen facere: felele Tmonda; nec sequentis dictionis corpus postrema huius coniunctionis litteram fonerare, atque adeo ipsam penitus corrumpere. Monda vox est patria integra ac significans; fmonda corrupta, ac omni prorsus significatione carens. Simile est iudicium de sequenti 20 voce:finczet aliis quibusdam, qua vulgus utitur pro eo, quod est efnincz, quae etiam scribi potest modo iam dicto: Tnincz. Dissimile: de fem.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
23, 4-5 De nova [...] imprimendi arte
Sylvester was convinced that the first book in Hungary was printed in Sarvar-Ujsziget. He did not know about his predecessors. We know two publications of Andreas Hess's press in Buda from 1473. There was a typographer - supposedly in Buda - also between 1477 and 1480 who is called "the printer of Confessionale" on the basis of one of his publications. In 1530, books were printed in Szeben (Sibiu, Rumania) as well, in Lukas Trapoldner's workshop. In 1539, in the year of the publication of Grammatica Hungarolatina, several works were issued in Johannes Honterus's press in Brasso (Brasov, Rumania). Apart from these, the earlier pressworks with Hungarian elements were mostly prepared in Cracow and Vienna.
23, 4 beneficio principis nostri
The press was equipped with the support of the "princeps", the landlord of Sarvar, Tamas Nadasdy. The preparations started in 1536. To lead the workshop, Nadasdy employed a German printer, Johannes Strutius (Johann Strauss). Strutius arrived in Sarvar in 1538. Sylvester observed his activity with continuous suspicion - not without reason.
23, 6 in hoc ludo
Sylvester turns to his own students. Nadasdy also had an elementary school built, which he consigned Sylvester to lead. Melanchthon, in Wittenberg, was also informed about the school by Matyas Devai Biro (see also 53, 16). In his letter to Nadasdy on 9,h October 1537, he thoroughly appreciates the significance of the new institution {Corpus Reformatorum, ed. Carolus Gottlieb BRETSCHNEIDER, Heinrich Ernst BINDSEIL, I-XXVIII, Halle, 1834-1860; III, 417418.). In the same letter, he recommends Devai and Sylvester to Nadasdy's benevolence.
119



23, 11 duci
Sylvester's patron, Tamas Nadasdy (1498-1562) was a politician and statesman of great reputation. He got his humanist education in Padova, Bologna, Rome, and Vienna. From 1524, he was secretary of chancery in Buda, in Lajos IPs court, from 1525, he was a royal councilor. He was a member of the Erasmian circle of the humanists in Buda. After the battle of Mohacs (1526), where King Lajos II died, themajorpartof Hungary fell underTurkish domination. Part of the Hungarian noblemen chose Janos Szapolyai, the Transylvanian voivod to be the king. Other noblemen chose Ferdinand Habsburg, the Austrian archduke, for the Hungarian crown. Nadasdy visited Ferdinand on their behalf and had a significant role in his coronation. As a reward for his service, he was appointed commander of the Buda castle. In 1529, the Turkish army occupied Buda, Nadasdy was captured. Soliman gave him to Szapolyai who pardoned him in return for his fidelity oath. For his service, he received important territories in Transylvania and East Hungary. In 1532, he married Orsolya Kanizsai; whose dowry brought him territories in West Hungary. In 1533, he returned to Ferdinand's side. He was the lord lieutenant of Vas county from 1534. He accepted Sylvester into his service in May 1534 at his castle in Sarvar upon the recommendation of the prebend of Eger, Tamas Mindszenti. Later he climbed to higher and higher offices: from 1537, he was viceroy of Croatia and Slavonia, from 1540 lord chief justice, from 1554 palatine.
23, 12 Neanesi
Sarvar has been a settlement in West Hungary since medieval times. It was also mentioned as Ujsziget, Naenesus is its Hellenistic name. It lies next to the river Raba and the Gyongyos stream. Indeed, in the 16,h century it was an island still surrounded by wild waters. The Kanizsai family's territory, it came under Nadasdy's authority in 1532 as part of Orsolya's dowry.

27, 3^4 Novum Testamentum
Sylvester's translation of the New Testament was completed in 1541 in the press of Sarvar-Ujsziget. As far as we know, this is the first complete Hungarian New Testament. The Hungarian version of several parts of the Bible existed in the medieval hand-written codexes; the most famous being the four gospels of the Munich codex (1466). We do not know if the whole Bible was translated. Erasmus's Greek-Latin edition and his comments were succeeded by his Hungarian followers. Benedek Komjathy translated Saint Paul's letters (Cracow, 1533), Gabor Pesti the four gospels (Vienna, 1536). We know from one of Sylvester's letters to Nadasdy (24,h June 1536) that by this time he was ready with the major part of the work.
27, 5 TTpoTTai5euuaTa
Sylvester considered Grammatica Hungarolatina a prestudy. As he thoroughly explains in the following, he intended the elementary language knowledge as a foundation for the later, higher level studies. At the same time, in parallel with translating the New Testament, the grammar could have been a prestudy for him as well and a useful exercise in fixing the language rules. (See also the preface of the present edition, page 8.)
27,28 Fabius
Sylvester praises the statements connected to grammar of the first author referred to, Quintilianus. Until the age of humanism, Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (c. 35-c. 96) was a classic authority not only on rhetoric, but also grammar. The two disciplines were closely related in the minds of people in earlier times. According to the ideas of antiquity, the grammarian is not only an expert of linguistic forms and structures but also a scholar of poetic texts. This was reflected both in Greek and Latin works. Hellenistic philology covered all the elements of studying texts. Dionysios Thrax's activity is also especially important for the effect he had. He unambiguously belonged to the Alexandrian philology tradition. In his definition, grammar is the practical study of what poets and writers generally say.
121



In the Roman theoretic literature, the science of correct language use and text interpretation appears together as the grammarians' task, for the first time, in Varro's works: "docte scribere legereque et erudite intellegere probareque" (De lingua Latina, 45-44 B.C.).
In Quintilianus's works, it is clear that grammar and rhetoric are in connection but these two fields are already distinct as well. According to Institutio oratoria, the sciences of appropriate speaking (scientia recte loquendi, I. 4-7) and poetic narration (enarratio poetarum, I. 8.) belong to the scope of grammar. The three virtues of rhetorical speech are: emendata, dilucida, ornata. The first virtue is accomplished by latinitas. This is discussed in the grammatic part significantly leaning on Aristotle, the stoic, and Dionysios Thrax. However, explaining the rules of clear and ornate speech is not the grammarian's task, but the rhetorisfs; the rhetorical books oflnstitutio discuss this. Thus, literary criticism is separate from grammar.

30, 24 Diomedis grammatici
Diomedes, who is mentioned by Sylvester several times, was working not long after Donatus. Between the two authors, the grammar history mentions Charisus whose Ars grammatica (around 360-370) follows Donatus according to the generally accepted views, whereupon Diomedes continues the example. Diomedes's Ars Grammatica was probably born around 370-380. Compared to other similar works, the research firmly states that Diomedes was a compiler, but he created such a precious synthesis of the diverse grammatical trends of his age, that he could almost be considered an original author. His work - just like Donatus's system, Ars minor and maior - consists of two levels of varying difficulty. The first one explains the most elementary information. The second presumes knowledge of the first, is built upon it, and develops it further. The connection between the grammatical knowledge and the analyzation of literary texts is obvious. The final aim of the work is to promote the analyzation of literary texts. It defines the ideas with which one can identify the stylistic means used by the writers in their works.
122



33, 7 ex Donato
Sylvester most often mentions Donatus. Throughout the centuries, the master's name was synonymous with Latin grammar. He lived in the 4,h century, he instructed Saint Jerome and also perhaps his later critic, Servius. He wrote criticisms on the works of Terence and Virgil. Upon a pedagogic consideration, Donatus divided the teaching of Latin grammar into two parts: Ars minor and Ars maior. Ars minor is a brief, elementary-level summary, an extract from the more extensive Ars maior. Its cue is the "octo partes orationis". The work makes pupils practise their main particulars and inflections with questions and answers. Ars maior was used on a higher level of education, and it consists of three parts. The first one is the detailed phonetics, that is the discussion of letters, syllables, metrical feet, stresses, punctuation marks. The second part is syntax, the description of the eight parts of speech. The third part concerns the values and errors of speech. Its discussion is ambitious, its style is clear and picturesque. There are only a few definitions and it illuminates the terms demonstrated with examples. Donatus fails to cite his references, but the difficult questions are explained at the end of each part. According to traditional opinion, Ars maior is simply the elaboration of the grammatical tradition developed during antiquity. The role of the dialectics of stoicism is especially important. Recent research calls attention to the features that go beyond tradition and names those authors which Donatus followed in providing a new altemative comparable to Dionysios Thrax. Quintilianus belongs here, too. The first promoter of Donatus's success was Servius who respected the master as "Grammaticus urbis Romae". Donatus's work was commented upon by many people in the 5lh and 6lh century. In the 6,h century, Priscianus used Donatus as a source and at the same time separated himself from him. Donatus meant the compendium of grammar education also during the Carolingian renaissance. From the Carolingian age, the earliest documentation is a comment on Donatus written by a monk before the 7lh century. Donatus's fame started to fade in the 7lh century. Other works became wellknown, especially extracts of Priscianus's monumental work. At the end of the Carolingian age, after 1100, Ars minor and Ars maior were separated and no longer used together. Until the 15lh century, only Ars minor was used in elementary education with a lot of amendments and changes, while in higher level education, Ars maior was displaced by Priscianus. Its phonology and morphology were more detailed than those of Donarus; and in addition, its 17 or 18 books contained a syntax. The third part of Donatus's Ars maior, concerning values and errors, enjoyed continued use as an independent work because there was no equivalent of it in Priscianus's work.
123



Donatus was rediscovered by the humanists and his work became the role model of classic Latin grammar from the middle of the 15,h century. Its versions containing amendments in vulgar languages played an important role in the development of the grammars of folk languages. (See more: the connecting entries in the bibliography.)
37, 28 Priscianus
The author worked in the 6,h century, but was forced to leave his homeland, Caesarea (Tenez) because of his religious ideas. He settled in Constantinople, where he studied and later taught grammar. First he wrote three smaller works (De figuris numerorum, De metris fabularum Terentii, Praeexercitamina). His monumental summary, Institutionum grammaticarum libri XVIII (526-527), is the longest elaboration of Latin grammar, after which he wrote further works. The most important innovation of Institutiones is the detailed discussion of syntax, which was briefly touched upon earlier by Gellius. This work by Priscianus has no rhetorical-stylistic chapters. It consists of three major parts. The 1sl and 2"d books discuss phonetics and everything possible within the combinations of sounds. The precise discussion of the parts of speech lasts from the end of the 2nd book to the end of the 16th book. The last two chapters contain syntax, in Latin constructio.
Priscianus determined a functional method in syntax for the first time, but when he used it on direct examples, these examples compelled him to alter his own original system. The augmentation of the diverse categories was meant to balance the rigidity of the original system, which basically did not satisfy the new method. In the end, Priscianus stopped augmenting the ideas and explaining the examples, altogether. Practice meant an endless difficulty, and it seemed to exclude any standard explanation. The final and fatal contradiction of Priscianus's work is seen in the fact that, while on the one hand he was the first to give a detailed syntactic analysis within the frame of a descriptive work, on the other hand he came into conflict with his own original rational requirements during the discussion. The great work was not arranged uniformly. The chapters on syntax were arranged in a shorter form as Constructio or Priscianus minor; the rest as Priscianus maior with comments and explanations. According to the concordant judgements of science, the period of antique grammar was closed with Institutiones; a summarizing work and an end point. Priscianus's heritage belongs to the history of both medieval grammar and logic.

39,4 Schytae
Schytia's inhabitants. See the next note!
39, 5 Schytia
The northern shore of the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus), between the Don (Tanais) and the Low Danube (Ister) with the neighboring territories. The warlike tribes belonging to the Iranian language family and living here between the 8,h century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. were called the Schyts in the literature of the Mediterranian civilizations, mostly in that of the Greeks, and their homeland was called Schytia. Antique and medieval authors usually used this name for the steppes of Eurasia and their nomadic people. Based on their Latin sources, the medieval Hungarian history writers (Anonymus, Simon Kezai) considered the territories of Maeotis (Sea of Azov) and Tanais and the lands west of them to be Schytia; and their inhabitants were regarded as the common ancestors of the Magyars and the Huns. In the time of humanism, the area and its inhabitants were interpreted in an even larger sense. In a popular manual, the following can be read for example: "Scythia ampla et barbara regio septentrionalis ab India ad Germaniam porrecta, ab uno latere pontum, ab altero ryphaeos montes habens, hinc scythicus." (Hermannus Torrentinus, Elucidahus poeticus continens historias, poeticas, fabulas, insulas, regiones, urbes, fluvios, montesque insigniores, atque huiusmodi alia, omnibus adolescentibus in poesi versantibus oppido quam necessarius, Coloniae, 1529, 17v).
41, 3-5 Erumpunt passim... Nos
The source of the quotation cannot be found in antique literature in the poems after which "Nos" is signed instead of a classic author's name. These lines are probably Syvester's own creations; it is also possible that they are the translations of the calendar poems or other Hungarian texts. (See more in BARTOK 2002, ItK, 485-501.)
43, 5 Lenobathes
It never occurs in classical Latin literature. Supposedly, it is a Latinized expression derived from the Greek \T\VOS ('grape extruding vat') and (3a9i>? ('deep') meaning 'deep grape extruding vat'.
125



44, 10 in Enchyridio piarum precationum
Based on the Latin name, we must think of a booklet that contains gracious prayers, a songbook or a prayerbook, for example. At present, from the time before the publication of Grammatica Hungarolatina, we only know of Istvan Galszecsi's songbook from the Hungarian pressworks. Sylvester's Latin translation is not far from the Hungarian title Kegyes inekekrul es keresztyen hitrul rovid konyvecske (Booklet on Gracious Prayers and Christian Faith). From the fragments found, we can conclude there were two editions (Cracow, 1536, 1538). Today, we only know about Istvan Szekely's songbook (Cracow, 1538) from the 18lh-century notes (Peter Bod, 1766). He translated "into Hungarian the congregational songs called old Latin hymns". Based on the data available, we do not know whether month descriptions in Hungarian hendecasyllables appear in Galszecsi's or Szekely's songbooks. (See more: BARTOK 2002, ItK, 485-501.)
44, 30 A. Gellius
Aulus Gellius (c. 123-165) was a Roman lawyer and grammarian. During his stay in Athens, he wrote the 20 books of Noctes Atticae by excerpting several earlier Greek and Latin authors' works. Its grammatical chapters (264-398) can be divided into two major parts. In the first part, the most needed particulars are discussed on an elementary level. The definition and tasks of grammar are followed by the discussion of the parts of speech, then the values and errors of speech are analyzed. The second part is the more elevated ars grammatica. The Alexandrian tradition also appears: poetarum enarratio, the interpretation of poets, is another grammatical work. Syntax is found in this part, for the first time in Latin grammatical literature. Gellius also discusses winds (2. 22. 12. 2. 22. 22.) according to Sylvester's reference.

46, 14 Guarinus Veronensis
Baptista Guarinus (Gianbattista Guarini, Battista Guarino, 15lh century) was the son of Janus Pannonius's teacher in Ferrara, Guarino da Verona. He took over the school after his father's death (1460). He is famous as a poet, an orator, and a letter writer as well. His best-known work is his educational manual about the order of learning and teaching (De ordine docendi ac studendi, 1459).
47,8 Meggefalfa
Having mentioned the better known cities of Hungary and the world, Sylvester here shifts to the important places in his life. Meggyesalja is a settlement in East Hungary, in Szatmar county. Sylvester calls the whole area Meggyesalja. The territory was the property of the Perenyi family. Other names of Megygyesalja: Aranyosmeggyes, Meggyes (Medias, Rumania).
47, 9 Ioannis a Peren
Janos Perenyi. His father, Gabor Perenyi, was lord lieutenant of Ugocsa and Maramaros. In his castle in Nyalabvar, he happily hosted the representatives of intellectual life. In 1508-09 Paulus Crosnensis, Polish humanist, lived here. In 1526, Gabor Perenyi died in the battle of Mohacs. His widow, Katalin Frangepan, charged Benedek Komjathy with Janos's education, and she also asked him to translate Saint Paul's letters (see also 27, 3-4). The castle of Nyalabvar remained an important intellecrual centre. In 1533 the printer of Cracow, Hieronymus Vietor wrote with appreciation about Katalin Frangepan. Sylvester also enjoyed the family's support. In his lyrical work, Rosarium Celeste Virginis Mariae... published in Cracow in 1527, he laments the fact that he cannot offer his work to his patron, Gabor Perenyi, who is no longer among the living.
47, 13 SzihirwaralTa

47,21 Rivulum dominarum
Medieval Latin name; its Hungarian correspondents are: Asszonypatak, Aszszonypataka. Some think the name refers to the Beginas, who moved here with the Fransiscans, but according to other opinions it specifies that the mining city was the property of the Hungarian queen.

under chief commander Ibrahim moved against Sarvar. They did not attack the castle immediately, but robbed and burnt the neighboring villages. The next attack was on 14lh August. Ibrahim, reinforced with a group of janicsars (Turkish mercenaries), besieged the castle. In the heavy fighting, one of the castle commanders, Istvan Keves, fell, the other one, Benedek Sibrik, was injured. The defenders of the castle broke out under Ferenc Batthyany's leadership, and scattered the besieging Turks, who retreated.

In 1532, at the fortifications of the castle the stream Gyongyos was channelled, the swamps were drained. The overgrowing forests were cut and in their place gardens of fruits and fiowers were created. Herbs were also grown, swans were raised in the garden ponds and a wild game park was established as well. Part of the garden produce was regularly sent to the royal court in Vienna.

47,39 Stephani
Stephanus Byzantinus (6lh century) was a Byzantine geographic writer. Besides Herodotos, Strabon, Ptolemaios Claudios, and Plinius the Elder, his work about cities (Tlepi TToXeujv) was an important source of information for the humanists. It was translated into Latin by Thomas de Pinedo with the title De urbibus.
48, 8 authore Servio
Marius Honoratus Servius, Roman grammarian lived at the end of the 4th century and wrote criticisms of Virgil. It is believed that he was Donatus's student. Different grammatical works are assigned to him, but only Commentarius in artem Donati can surely be considered his work. Here again appears the thought that grammar is closely connected to those sciences dealing with language (philosophy, dialectics, and especially rhetoric). Together with Donatus, he taught that the aim of grammatical studies is to examine the parts of speech, and the interpretation of poetic texts is based on this. The statement that "oleaster" is masculine and "siler" is neutral is in Sylves
129



ter's comment on Aeneid: "fere omnia Latina arborum nomina generis feminini sunt, exceptis paucis, ut »hic oleaster« et »hoc siler«" (Commentarii in Vergilii Aeneidos Libros, 12, 766.) That "spinus" is masculine can be read in Servius's comment on Georgica: "spinos iam pruna ferentes prunorum arbor spinus vocatur genere masculino; nam sentes has spinas dicimus." (Commentarii in Vergilii Georgicon Libros, 4. 145.) From the exceptions mentioned by Sylvester, "rubus", "dumus", and "spinus" do not appear in Servius's work.
48, 9 Cicero
This is Sylvester's only reference in which he refers not to a grammarian from the classics, but to a writer. According to the second passage of the rule referring to the gender of nouns, the gender of trees is always feminine. Oil tree is one of the listed masculine exceptions. Still, it appears as feminine in Cicero's works. This case is the only example of the phenomena that besides the rule presented in the definition of grammar, (ars) auctoritas also appears, in this case one of the authorities of the optimorum oratorum. Otherwise, in other text versions "oleaster" appears as masculine at the given place: "Postea cum ad eum Nymphodorus venisset Aetnam et oraret ut sibi sua restituerentur, hominem corripi ac suspendi iussit in oleastro quodam, quae est arbor, iudices, Aetnae in foro." (Cicero, In Verrem 2, 3, 57, 7-8.) Aetna is an antique city in Sicily, at the feet of Etna Hill.
48, 17 Celso
The reference appears in the sense that each nation tries to give names in its own language to trees, herbs, stones etc. Even the Greek, if we can believe Celsus. We know of two authors called Celsus. A work by Arruntius Celsus, Roman grammarian, touches on the connections of Latin and Greek names as well. (De proprietate et differentiis Latini sermonis.) An edition is in the following collection: Vulcanius, Bonaventura ed.: Thesaurus utriusque linguae [...] Veteres Grammatici Latini et Graeci qui de proprietate et differentiis vocabulorum utriusque linguae scripserunt, Lugduni Batavorum, 1600. Aurelius Cornelius Celsus was a medical specialist writer. The fifth chapter of his big summary (Medicinae libri octo, Noviter emendati et impressi: cum tabula repertoria cuiuslibet libri et capituli, Lugduni, 1516) is about the treatment of diseases, including the use of plants, minerals, and other materials of medicinal effect. Beside the Latin names, the author also gives the Greek ones: "quod Graeci [...] appellant"; "quod a Graecis [...] nominatur"; "quod Graeci [...] vocant", and with similar expressions.

48, 23 Sulpitius
Johannes Sulpitius Verulanus (Giovanni Antonio Sulpizio) was an Italian humanist. He was born before 1450 in Veroli. From 1475, he studied in Perugia, then in Urbino; around 1480, he was living in Rome, and belonged to Pomponius Laetus's circle. He edited a vast number of texts. He made the editio princeps of Vitruvius's De architectura. He published Vegetius Renatus's, Aelianus's, and Frontinus's works. His comments on Lucanus and Quintilianus were published the most times. Some of his poetic works have survived as well. He wrote prosodic summaries, too (De versuum scansione, De syllabarum quantitate). Sulpitius edited several grammatical works and Erasmus regarded him as one of the best grammarians of his age. Sylvester closes the part about the gender of nouns saying that he has explicated enough of the general rules so far. As for the rest of the general and specific regulations, he directs the pupils to other authors. He considers the works put in rhymes the most practical because those are easier to memorize and remain better in the memory. From the more recent authors, he mentions Sulpitius and Lilius. Their names often appeared together. The volume which included Sulpitius's summary entitled De constructionis figuris and Lilius's De constructione octo partium orationis was a popular Latin grammar textbook in the first decades of the 16lh century. The latter one was published with Erasmus's corrections, thus it is in some cases recorded among his works. Sulpitius's syntax and his several other grammatical works were written in prose. Nevertheless a version in rhyme of Sulpitius's grammar existed as well, which Sylvester refers to. At the turn of the 15* and 16,h century, it was published several times by Jodocus Badius Ascensius (Joost van Assche), the publisher of Dutch origin, working in Paris. In 1508, the work received its fifth "recognitio" (Quinta recognitio atque additio ad Grammaticen Sulpitianam). The work was issued in German-speaking areas in the same year (Sulpitii Verulani de grammatices arte volumen Jodoci Badii opera per carmina compendiosius communicatum, Francofurti, 1508), and it was followed by further editions as well.
48,23 Lilius
Guilielmus Lilius (William Lily) English grammarian was born around 1468. He studied at Oxford. He travelled to Jerusalem, then he educated himself on the island of Rhodes. In Rome, he studied grammar from Pomponius Laetus and Sulpitius Verulanus. He returned to England around 1492. In 1512, the dean of St. Paul School of London, John Colet, appointed him head teacher of the institute (ludi moderator primarius), which was one of the centres of
131



humanist education. Lilius wrote epigrams in Latin. His epigrams translated from Greek into Latin were published in a joint issue with Thomas More's similar works (Progymnasmata Thomae Mori et Guilielmi Lilii sodalium, Basileae, 1518). His death is usually dated to 1523, but some data suggest 10th December, 1522. Lilius's grammarian activity is connected to his work as a teacher. He prepared two versions of his Latin grammar, in English and in Latin. In the morphology of the latter one, research specifies the relationships of Donatus's, Sulpitius's, Melanchthon's, Linacre's, and Colefs works. Its syntax is a derivation of the above mentioned De constructione octo partium orationis. The centralization of education was already being urged by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIILs lord chancellor. The basis of the standardization of Latin grammar was the compendium linked to Lilius's name. The material was being shaped even after the author's death; it reached its final form around 1540. The use of the English (A Shorte Introduction ofGrammar) and Latin versions (Brevissima institutio seu ratio grammatices cognoscendae) was made compulsory in schools in 1548 by Edward VI's order. The so-called Grammatica Liliana was the basis of scholastic Latin education in England for three hundred years. In the 16-17,h centuries, this was the most frequently - hundreds of times - published similar work besides Melanchthon's grammar. Different adaptations, extracts were created from "Lilius". The lyrical version recommended by Sylvester could also be one of them.

52, 10 Philippus Melanchthon
Philippus Melanchthon (1497-1560) was a determining figure in the humanism of the Reformation. For scholastic purposes, he resystematized human sciences (dialectics, grammar, profane and ecclesiastical rhetoric). For centuries, his textbooks were used in Protestant schools all over Europe. The most effective one is his Latin grammar. The morphology was first published without the author's name (Grammatica Latina, Hagenau, 1525). The following edition contained morphology as well (Grammatica Latina Philippi Melanchthonis ab autore nuper aucta et recognita, Hagenau, 1526). Melanchthon created the first edition for elementary education. The didactic aim was more important to him than any theoretical consideration. In the later editions, the text developed in diverse directions. On the one hand, attempts were made to raise the material to ever higher levels. Melanchthon's student, Jacobus Mycillus, significantly augmented classic citations and references (Francofurti, 1540). Later, further adaptations were made. Joachim Camerarius (Lipsiae, 1550) greatly increased
132



the quality. He incorporated much from contemporary authors' works (Linacre, Scaliger) and the effect of the philosophical grammatical view definitely prevailed. This version was used in universities. As opposed to augmentation, the other direction of changes to the work was simplification, shortening. The first representative of this trend was Lucas Lossius (Witebergae, 1544) who elaborated the material in the form of questions and answers. The different adaptations of Melanchthon's work were published in hundreds of editions. Together with "Philippus" Lilius's grammar, it was the most frequently issued Latin grammar textbook of the 16—17,h centuries. Research has dealt a great deal with its effect on Grammatica Hungarolatina.
The Greek grammar mentioned by Sylvester was first published in 1518; it had about 40 editions.

53, 16 Deuanus
Matyas Devai Biro (c. 1500-1545) belongs to the first Hungarian transmitters of the ideas of the Reformation. His spelling regulation, Orthographia Ungarica, is very important in the history of Hungarian grammatical literature. Today we only know about a 1549 edition of the work. No sample has survived of the supposed first edition in Cracow in about 1538. Sylvester probably did not know Devai's referred ideas and, at any rate, showed in his own work that he did not agree with them.

The expression "incognita" is the result of a text impairment instead of "incondita". In the different Donatus editions both the authentic and the impaired versions appear. Sylvester's direct sample obviously contained the latter one. (See more: BART6K 1999, MNy, 456^59.)

INDEX
The standing numbers relate to the names occurring in the text of Grammatica Hungarolatina and in the footnotes, the cursive ones refer to the ones in the preface, bibliography, and the explanatory notes. The Latin versions are followed by the names used today in round brackets, at the geographical names we give the Hungarian names appearing in Grammatica Hungarolatina in square brackets. Several occurring cities of historical Hungary are now outside the present borders. In these cases, we mark the country in which they are today (RO=Rumania, SK=Slovakia), and we give their names in the language of the given country as well. If the diverse variations are too far from each other because of the alphabetical order, we take up both variants to the index as separate entries, and we use a reference: Ister —>Danubius. If the variants follow each other in the alphabetical order, we give both versions in the same entry: Pest [...] Pestum.
