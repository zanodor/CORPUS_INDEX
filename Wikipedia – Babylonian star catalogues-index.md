Babylonian star catalogues
Babylonian astronomy collated earlier observations and divinations
into sets of Babylonian star catalogues, during and after the
Kassite rule over Babylonia. These star catalogues, written in
cuneiform script, contained lists of constellations, individual stars,
and planets. The constellations were probably collected from various
other sources. The earliest catalogue, Three Stars Each, mentions
stars of Akkad, of Amurru, of Elam and others.
Various sources have theorized a Sumerian origin for these
Babylonian constellations,[1] but an Elamite origin has also been
proposed.[2] A connection to the star symbology of Kassite kudurru
border stones has also been claimed, but whether such kudurrus
really represented constellations and astronomical information aside
from the use of the symbols remains unclear.
Star catalogues after Three Stars Each include the MUL.APIN list
named after the first Babylonian constellation MULAPIN, "the Plough",
which is the current Triangulum constellation plus Gamma
Andromedae. It lists, among others, 17 or 18 constellations in the
zodiac. Later catalogues reduce the zodiacal set of constellations to
12, which were borrowed by the Egyptians and the Greeks, still
surviving among the modern constellations.
Three Stars EachEdit
The first formal compendia of star lists are the Three Stars Each
texts appearing from about the twelfth century BC. They represent a
tripartite division of the heavens: the northern hemisphere belonged
to Enlil, the equator belonged to Anu, and the southern hemisphere
belonged to Enki. The boundaries were at 17 degrees North and
South, so that the Sun spent exactly three consecutive months in



each third. The enumeration of stars in the Three Stars Each
catalogues includes 36 stars, three for each month. The determiner
glyph for "constellation" or "star" in these lists is MUL (!), originally
a pictograph of three stars, as it were a triplet of AN signs; e. g. the
Pleiades are referred to as a "star cluster" or "star of stars" in the
lists, written as MUL.MUL, or MULMUL (!!).
MUL.APINEdit
Main article: MUL.APIN
The second formal compendium of stars in Babylonian astronomy is
the MUL.APIN, a pair of tablets named for their incipit,
corresponding to the first constellation of the year, MULAPIN "The
Plough", identified with Triangulum plus Gamma Andromedae. The
list is a direct descendent of the Three Stars Each list, reworked
around 1000 BC on the basis of more accurate observations. They
include more constellations, including most circumpolar ones, and
more of the zodiacal ones.
The Babylonian star catalogues entered Greek astronomy in the 4th
century BC, via Eudoxus of Cnidus and others. A few of the
constellation names in use in modern astronomy can be traced to
Babylonian sources via Greek astronomy. Among the most ancient
constellations are those that marked the four cardinal points of the
year in the Middle Bronze Age, i.e.
Taurus "The Bull", from (!"#$) MULGU4.AN.NA "The Steer
of Heaven", marking vernal equinox
Leo "The Lion", from (!%) MULUR.GU.LA "The Lion", marking
summer solstice
Scorpius "The Scorpion", from (!&') MULGIR.TAB "The
Scorpion", marking autumn equinox
Capricornus "Goat-Horned", from (!()*)



MULSUḪUR.MAŠ "The Goat-Fish", marking winter solstice. It is a
mythological hybrid depicted on boundary stones from before
2000 BC as a symbol of Ea.
There are other constellation names which can be traced to Bronze
Age origins, including Gemini "The Twins", from (!+',--)
MULMAŠ.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL "The Great Twins", Cancer "The Crab",
from (!./) MULAL.LUL "The Crayfish", among others.
The MUL.APIN gives
a catalogue of 71 stars and constellations of the "Three Ways"
of the Three Stars Each tradition. The star names (prefixed with
MUL !) are listed with the associated deity (prefix DINGIR #)
and often some other brief epithet.

Zodiacal constellationsEdit
The path of the Moon as given in MUL.APIN consists of 17 or
18 stations, recognizable as the direct predecessors of the 12 sign



zodiac. At the beginning of the list with MUL.MUL, the Pleiades,
corresponds to the situation in the Early to Middle Bronze Age when
the Sun at vernal equinox was close to the Pleiades in Taurus
(closest in the 23rd century BCE), and not yet in Aries.[3][4]

The "Tail" and the "Great Swallow" (items 15 and 16 above) have also
been read as a single constellation the "Tail of the Swallow" (Pisces),
whence the uncertainty whether the Babylonian "zodiac" consists of
17 or 18 constellations. All constellations of the Iron Age 12 sign
zodiac are present among them, most of them with names that
clearly identify them, while some reached Greek astronomy with
altered names; thus "Furrow" became Virgo, "Pabilsag" Sagittarius,
"Great One" Aquarius, "Swallow Tail" Pisces and "Farm Worker" was
reinterpreted as Aries.
Virgo, and her main star Spica, have Babylonian precedents. The
MUL.APIN associates Absin "The Furrow" with the Sumerian
goddess Shala, and on boundary stones of the Kassite era Shala is
conventionally depicted as holding a length of grain. Regarding
Sagittarius, Pabilsag is a comparatively obscure Sumerian god, later
identified with Ninurta. Another name for the constellation was Nebu
"The Soldier".
Aquarius "The Water-Pourer" represents Ea (a water god), dubbed
"The Great One" in the MUL.APIN. It contained the winter solstice in
the Early Bronze Age. In Greek astronomy, he became represented
as simply a single vase from which a stream poured down to Piscis
Austrinus. The name in the Hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha "water
pitcher", showing that the zodiac reached India via Greek
intermediaries.
The current definition of Pisces is the youngest of the zodiacal
constellations. The "Swallow" of Babylonian astronomy included the
western fish, but was larger as it included as well parts of Pegasus.
The square of Pegasus was the constellation of the "field", shown in
the Dendera zodiac between the two fishes. The northern fish and
part of Andromeda represented the goddess Anunitum, the "Lady of
the Heaven". Late Babylonian sources mention also DU.NU.NU "The



Fish-Cord". It is unclear how the "Farm Worker" of the MUL.APIN
became Aries "The Ram" of Greek tradition, possibly via association
with Dumuzi the Shepherd.
Somewhere around the 5th century BCE, Babylonian astronomical
texts began to describe the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets
in terms of 12 equally-spaced signs, each one associated with a
zodiacal constellation, each divided into 30 degrees (uš). This
normalized zodiac is fixed to the stars and totals 360 degrees.[5]
