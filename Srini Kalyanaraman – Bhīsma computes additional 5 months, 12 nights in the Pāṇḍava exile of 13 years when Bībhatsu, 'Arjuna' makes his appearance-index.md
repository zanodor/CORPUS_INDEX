Bhīsma computes additional 5 months, 12 nights in the Pāṇḍava exile of 13 years when Bībhatsu, 'Arjuna' makes his appearance
--thus, Bhīsma justifies that there has been no violation of the vow for 13 year exile including ajnātavāsa of Pāṇḍava
--A question is raised that additional period should be 5 months and 6 days and NOT 5 months 12 mentioned by Bhīsma
--I submit that the 12 dvādaśa (in addition to māsāḥ pañca) mentioned by Bhīsma is a reference to 12 or dvādaśa karana (i.e. since karana is half-tithi, the computation by Bhīsma is correct.) This is the reason why KM Ganguly translates the expression as twelve 'nights.' and NOT twelve 'tithi'.

"Bhishma said, 'The wheel of time revolves with its divisions, viz., with Kalas and Kasthas and
Muhurtas and days and fortnights and months and constellations and planets and seasons and years. In consequence of their fractional excesses and the deviations of also of the heavenly bodies, there is an increase of two months in every five years. It seems to me that calculating this wise, there would be an excess of five months and twelve nights in thirteen years. Everything, therefore, that the sons of Pandu had promised, hath been exactly fulfilled by them. Knowing this to be certain, Vibhatsu hath made his appearance. All of them are highsouled and fully conversant with the meanings of the scriptures. How would they deviate from virtue that have Yudhishthira for their guide?

Note: Bībhatsu (बीभुत्स ).—One of the ten names of Arjuna. He got this name because he desisted from doing loathful acts. "I will never resort to loathful deeds in war. Therefore the devas and men call me Bibhatsu". (Mahābhārata, Virāṭa Parva, Chapter 44, Stanza 18).
