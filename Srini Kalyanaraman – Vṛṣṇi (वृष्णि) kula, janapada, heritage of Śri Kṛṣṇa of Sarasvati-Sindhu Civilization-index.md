Note: A significant episode with metalwork overtones is in the name of Kamsa, a Vṛṣṇi. Kamsa, also spelt Kansa (कं स, Kamsa), was the tyrant ruler of the Vṛṣṇi kingdom with its capital at Mathura. He is the cousin of Devaki, the mother of the god Krishna—who slew Kamsa. Kamsa is described as human in early sources and a rākṣasa (demon) in the Puranas.

Carved from left to right is Samkarsana/Balarama holding a mace in the right hand and a ploughshare topped by a lion-face in the left hand. Next to him is Vasudeva-Krishna with his right hand in abhaya-mudra and the left hand holding a conch-shell and placed on hip. The next figure is of Narasimha which clearly indicates towards the merger of Sattvat cult with the Pancha Vrishni Vira Cult. The next figure is of Pradyumna who holds a bow in his left hand and an arrow in his right hand. To his left is the figure of Samba who holds a wine goblet in his right hand and his left hand is on his waist. The last figure is that of Aniruddha who is holding a sword in his right hand and a shield in his left hand. Sculpture is dated to 3rd-early 4th century CE. http://tinyurl.com/hnfr6t6

Varshneya (वाणिेय) is an Indian bania caste, also called bara
saini (Rose, H.A., A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the
Punjab and North-West, Volume 2, p.61). Tradition notes them as traders and bankers. (William Crook, Tribes and Castes of North Western Provinces and Oudh, Volume I, pages 177–8).

Balarama, Akrur and Krishna in Gopi Nath temple, Akrur Ghat, Vrindavan, Mathura. Adi Varaha Purana celebrates this place of pilgrimage. Akrur reportedly saw the forms of Vishnu and Sesha in Krishna and Balarama. The great-great-grandfather of Akrur and Krishna was Vrishni. Akrur was a chief in Dvārakā and his chiefdom may be traced to the rule by Vrishni.(Pargiter, F. E.,1922, Ancient Indian Historical Tradition. Oxford University Press, p.280).

The lineage of Akrur is: Yadu, Krostu, Satvata, Vrishni, Yudhajit,. Śvaphalka and Akrur. (Pargiter, F. E. (1922). Ancient Indian Historical Tradition. Oxford University Press, pp. 102-109). Akrur was an uncle of Krishna and is cited in the following historical (itihāsa) narratives: -- Akrur rose to fame as a commander of the Yadava army. (Chapter 220 of Adi Parva, Mahābhārata).
-- Akrur was also present for the Swayamvara (wedding) of Draupadi. (Sloka 18, Chapter 185 of Adi Parva, Mahābhārata). -- At the time that Arjuna eloped with Subhadra, a grand festival was being held in the Raivataka mountain, Akrur partook in the festival (Sloka 10, Chapter 218, Adi Parva, Mahābhārata).
-- Akrur accompanied Krishna to the marriage of Subhadra (Sloka 29, Chapter 220, Adi Parva, Mahābhārata) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrura) Harivaṃśa हररवंश (Viṣṇu parva chapters 25-28) recount the journey of Krishna and
Samkarsana to Kamsa’s court accompanied by Akrur.

other Puranas. To this literature in Sanskrit has been added other literature, for the story of his life has been told in epic, song and story by thousands of poets in every Indian language for centuries. In the course of being so told, Shri Krishna has come to be invested with traits and credited with exploits of such divergent nature that it becomes difficult, if not impossible, for a reader to have a clear picture of the Krishna as he was known by his contemporaries."

They appear in the Gaṇapāṭha of Panini of 5th Century BCE K K Das Gupta has attempted to show that they existed even in Brahmana period. They were enterprising people having prosperous trade and commerce...Their capital was Kotesvara or Kachchhesvara...(Ancient India, from the earliest times to the first century, A.D by Rapson, E.

Post Mauryan Local Coins North India
[quote]On the decline of the Mauryas and the Sungas in about third-second century BCE, several small states and chiefdoms emerge on the political scene in North India. Some of these states were those which had earlier been annexed to the Magadha-Mauryan Empire. These states issued their own coins which show a multiplicity of types. Coins of some states like Kosala, Vatsa, Surasena, Panchala etc are issued with the name of kings and are therefore popularly called ‘monarchical / dynastic’ issues. In the Central Indian region are found coins which are issued in the name of cities like Vidisa, Tripuri, Mahishmati, Ujjayini, Madavika, Bhagila, Erikachchha etc and these are called ‘City Issues’. In the hilly regions of north, coins were issued bearing the name of some tribes like Audumbara, Vemaki, Kuninda, Yaudheya, Vrishni etc and these are called ‘Tribal’ coins.Apart from a few ‘Tribal’ coins which were also issued in silver, coins of this period were issued predominantly in the cheaper metals like copper and bronze. Though the earlier techniques like the punching and casting continued to be used for making coins at some places, another technique, namely ‘die-striking’, which soon became the predominant coin manufacturing technique, was also introduced in this period. And the most important feature that was introduced on the coins of this period was the introduction of a short coin inscription written in Brahmi, the earliest Indian script [unquote]

Tribal, Audumbara Janapada, Rudradasa (100 BCE), Punjab Region, Post-Mauryan period, Copper Unit, Obv: a threestoried temple with an axe-shafted and a ribboned trident on the right field, the Brahmi legend "Mahadevasa (Rana Rudradasasa) Odubarisa" around the field, Rev: a tree within railings and the forepart of an elephant on the right field, with a wavy river-like line below, the Kharoshthi legend "Mahadevasa Rana (Rudradasasa Odubarisa)" around the field, 2.8g, 15.76x17.7mm, (Handa # Pl. VII-5), almost complete details visible, choice extremely fine, Extremely Rare.
Note: This is one of the finest known specimens in this quality that has been recently offered in any sale, with details immaculately visible on both sides. This is the most complete coin we have offered from this Janapada.
The earliest reference to the Audumbaras, or the Udambaras or the Odumbaras as they are called, is from the Ganapatha of Panini, who classifies them as being of the Rajanya class. They were amongst the most prominent tribes of ancient India and asserted their dominance from the Himachal foothills between Siramaur, Chamba, and the Yamuna. They have been credited to have issued coins and the first specimens attributed to them were identified by Alexander Cunningham around 1872-73, from the 1st century BCE. These coins include square or oblong copper and round silver pieces which were found at Pathankot in Gurudaspur district in northern Punjab. They are very rare and have been discovered almost exclusively in Punjab's Kangra district. https://www.coinarchives.com/a/lotviewer.php?LotID=1984947&AucID=4708&Lot=33&Val=8b996f6d87703d2630413 100b590dd62

Tribal-Post Mauryan, Audumbara Dynasty (100 BCE), Punjab Region, Copper Unit,
Obv: a storied temple with a trident-axe on the right field and traces of Brahmi legend
around the field, Rev: a tree within railings and the forepart of an elephant on the right field,
wavy river line below and Kharoshthi legend around the field, 2.35g,

Note: The earliest reference to the Audumbaras, or the Udambaras or the Odumbaras as they
are also called, is from the Ganapatha of Panini who classifies them as being of the Rajanya
class. They were amongst the most prominent tribes of ancient India and asserted their
dominance from the Himachali foothills between Siramaur, Chamba and Yamuna. They have
been credited to have issued coins and the first specimens attributed to them as identified by
Alexander Cunningham around 1872-73, were from the 1st century BCE. These coins include
square or oblong copper and round silver pieces which were found at Pathankot in
Gurudaspur district in northern Punjab. They are very rare and have been discovered almost
exclusively in Punjab's Kangra district.
Sivadasa, Rudradasa, Dharaghosa and Mahadeva are some individual who have been identified as Audaumbara kings, though more recent epigraphical evidence, such as the typological analysis of their coins as presented by Devendra Handa in his book "Tribal Coins of India" (2007), has brought some of their reigns as rulers of this tribe into question. Inscription on Audumbara coins are in the Brahmi and Kharoshiti scripts and clearly depict them as being of the Shaivite faith. Karithikeya was also a popular deity. The bull, the temple with a trident-axe and the figure of Vishwamitra are common motifs from their culture.

Udumbara (उदुम्बर ) [probably] refers to Ficus racemosa (Indian fig tree), in the Moraceae family. Certain plant parts of Udumbara are eaten as a vegetable (śāka), according to Caraka in his Carakasaṃhitā sūtrasthāna (chapter 27), a classical Ayurvedic work. The plant is therefore part of the Śākavarga group of medicinal plants, referring to the “group of vegetables/pot-herbs”. Caraka defined such groups (vargas) based on the dietic value of the plant. It is a deciduous tree with few aerial roots. The bark has a soft surface. The flowers bear pleasantly fragrant orange to crimson fruits. It grows all over India. Udumbara (or Uduṃbara) in the Marathi language refers to the medicinal tree “Ficus racemosa Linn. Syn. Ficus glomerata Roxb.”, and is used for ethnomedicine treatment of Fever in Ahmednagar district, India. The parts used are milky “Latex”. Udumbara (उदम्ुबर ).—A Trayārṣeya. Belong to

Udumbara (उदुम्बर ) refers to an ancient kingdom or tribe of people, according to the Bṛhatsaṃhitā (chapter 5), an encyclopedic Sanskrit work written by Varāhamihira mainly focusing on the science of ancient Indian astronomy astronomy (Jyotiṣa).—Accordingly, “If the sun and moon should begin to be eclipsed when only half risen, deceitful men will suffer as well as sacrificial rites. [...] If they should be eclipsed when in the sign of Libra (Tulā), the people of the extreme border lands on the west, the people of Sindha, the trading classes and the people of Kaccha will be afflicted with miseries. If when in the sign of Scorpio (Vṛścika), the people of Udambara, of Madra, of Colā and of Yaudheya will all suffer miseries along with soldiers armed with poisoned weapons”.

The winter solstice occurred on 13th January, 3066 BCE Bhishma died on 17th January, 3066 BCE The comet Mahaghora appeared at the asterism Pushya in October, 3066 B.C Mahabharat War started on November 22, 3067 BCE. This comes out of astronomical evidence. And the astronomical juxtapositions are not arbitrary or those that could happen in any decade or such... but some of them have not happened since. They are THAT rare a phenomenon. Saturn at Rohini and Mars at Jyestha with two eclipses - a Lunar eclipse at Kartik and Solar eclipse at Jyesth. (these are from Udyoga and Bhisma Parvan). (1)Amavasya occurs in Jyestha in 19 years (2) (1) PLUS Solar Eclipse in Jyesth occurs in 340 years. (3) (2) PLUS Saturn at Rohini occurs ONCE in 7000 years. So, that constellation in astronomy has NOT occured since Mahabharata. The date exact one - when that would have happened is Nov 22, 3067 BCE. http://sivaramaswami.media/krishna-and-mahabharat-historical-reality

Prof. Srinivasa Raghavan, a jois presents jyotiṣa computations of skymaps to state that (a) birth of Sri Krishna occured at 11.40 PM Friday 27 July 3112 BCE; Bhadrapada month, Krishna Ashtami, Rohini Naksatra. (b) and the end of Krishna avatāra occurred in the afternoon of 13 February 3031 BCE Friday, Chaitra Sukla Prathama, Uttaraprosthapada naksatra, Sri Krishna ascended to heaven. Thus ends his Kaliyuga avatāra which began on 27 July 3112 BCE and ended on 13 February 3031 BCE (a day after the Yadava Civil War, consistent with the curse of Gāndhāri). MBh war events occurred during these 81 years of Krishna avatāra; and 35 years before the end of Sri Krishna's Kaliyuga avatāra. The start date of Kali era calendar is 18 Feb. 3102. I request scholars to determine the age of Sri Krishna on this date. Was it the date when Sri Krishna was 10 years old? It appears that saṃ-dhyāṃśa of 100 years between Dvāpara & Kali explain why MBh war events occurred in Kali era 3067 BCE (i.e., between 3112 BCE and 3102 BCE) See: https://tinyurl.com/37zpuxtj It appears MBh war events occurred after 3112, the commencement
date of saṃ-dhyāṃśa of 100 years between Dvāpara & Kali.

Horoscope presented for Friday 27 July 3112 BCE 11:40PM by Prof. Srinivasa Raghavan differs from the kundali Seen by Surdar ji. What was the birth-date and time for Surdasji’s kundali? The challenge for astronomers is to determine the DOB of Śri Kṛṣṇa, consistent with curse of Gāndhāri & Saros 18-year Eclipse Cycles to explain eclipse seasons of 3067 and 3031 BCE.
