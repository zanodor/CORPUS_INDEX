Introduction
The results of our previous research was published in The God Secret where we showed how the mysteries of the Egyptian religion had grown out of interpretations from the links that were imaginatively formulated between the stars that revolve around the northern pole position. In the Egyptian tradition these stars were known as the imperishable stars or the stars that never set.
The analysis was conclusive and we were able to show that the ancient Egyptian mysteries had been carried through into many aspects of Christianity and in large part, were duplicated in the Book of Revelation. At the end of the book we confidently proclaimed that Christianity had grown out of the old Egyptian Religion that had been violently suppressed and condemned by the Hebrew hierarchy since the time of Moses and that it could well have emanated from an underground minority who wished to resurrect the old beliefs in a more up-to-date form. We went even further and stated that as there is no tangible proof that anyone named Jesus Christ actually existed and that the entire story of Jesus may be an elaborate fiction. In this book we would like to take another look at this broad brush elimination of the Jesus Christ figure and examine (with some scepticism) the possibility that there was an individual that the Christ story was based on.
Logic tells us that an incarnate Almighty God, who controls the power to create everything in the Universe including each individual life, would be able to see all things including the



2
future. At the stage in time when the Judeo/Christian God is said to have chosen one infinitesimally small planet from all the billions of planets in the Universe, and condemned the forebears of humanity to be banished from the Garden of Eden, the implications of such actions would have already been clear to him/her/it.
Despite that, sometime later Christians tell us that God sent
His ‘son’ in human guise to be murdered by humans in
reparation for the sins of disobedience attributed to Adam and
Eve and to thus get the Human Race get off the hook.
He/it had given humanity free will but because we hadn’t
used it the way that He/it found appropriate, He/it had decided to intervene to save us from ourselves. This God sounds like a being who is altruistic on the one hand but self centred and selfish on the other. He/it is projected as a being full of infinite love but His/its actions betray ultimate violence and punishment to all who are not subservient to His/its will.
Why would such an infinitely aware God interrupt the pattern of normal evolution with an altruistic gesture that would help save humanity from its inherited condemnation and create a
route to eternal salvation, oftentimes prosecuted by violence?
Why did the race of people into which ‘the saviour’ of
humanity was born reject him? More importantly, why did such an all-knowing deity chose this route from the infinite number of possibilities available? Why did God need the gesture? If this God entity exists is He/it as fallible as us humans and does He/it suffer from anger, loneliness and pride as the



3
scriptures would have us believe. Or, is the story as illogical as it sounds and without any real foundation?
A long time ago, the Service Manager of a well known car
dealership proclaimed; “there’s always some truth in every story.” This was a man who met people in the early days of
motor cars when there were manual chokes, manual window winders and the car owner needed to insert a key to unlock the door. One customer, who complained that her car cut out after several miles, was asked to drive it by this Service Manager and he discovered that she pulled out the manual choke and
used it as a place to hang her handbag. Small wonder that the
car did not function correctly. This Service Manager’s story
stuck with the author and since then his proclamation has been one of the principals that have guided all our research into the mysteries that surround the foundations of organised religion. Because of this, and despite the obvious illogicality
of the Christ story, we believe that it is likely that there is
‘some’ truth in the story. Two thousand years ago ‘something’
must have happened that was the basis for Christianity and for the deeply persuasive nature of the doctrine it continues to propose.
In ancient times communication was slow. The stories about and beliefs of those with great influence were incorporated into monuments for everyone to see and read. Centres of learning and official record keepers kept accounts on scrolls or they were sometimes written in stone. Most stories however were passed from person to person and suffered all the problems of distortion that is inherent to such a method. With regard to the Christians, there were a large number of



4
documents that were written after the time of Christ, many
based on hearsay. More than three hundred years after the so
called ‘life of Jesus’ Emperor Constantine congregated a
group of Bishops (so called) in Nicaea and any distortion problem was attacked by assembling one group of documents into a single text, which has become known as the New Testament and which incorporates what have become known as the Canonical Gospels. Some of the writings that were circulating at the time were omitted and came to be known as the Apocryphal or Gnostic gospels. The New Testament was then described as the Holy Word of God so that no one would dream of questioning it, never mind
altering it and at the time of its publication, it was
accompanied by a ‘creed’ that every believer was invited to
repeat on a regular basis.
I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was



5
buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.
This move to consolidate ‘the faith’ was accompanied by the repetitive incantation of ‘the creed’ by priests and by the
inculcation of stories into canticles and ballads and poems that have been reproduced by monks, priests, and bards over the centuries. We will attempt to examine the evidence and investigate the various possibilities to help us find a realistic basis for the
Jesus Christ story and for the existence of the personality that
is portrayed in the New Testament Gospels and this person’s claim to the title ‘Son of God’. The possibility that there was a
person around whom the legend was woven will be examined and when examining such a person we will attempt to attribute a legitimate basis for his universally proclaimed divine inheritance.

Chapter 1 The written evidence
There are several places that need to be examined for evidence of Jesus Christ. These include The New Testament, The Talmud, any Roman records or bibliographies and the Nag Hammadi and/or Dead Sea Scrolls. In addition, we will look for other historical references that may have been passed down through time that could have been created and formed at that time and which have retained their original integrity.
The Canonical Gospels
It is generally accepted by historians, that the Jesus stories were written variously between 50 CE and 100 CE and that they were written in Greek. Up until that time it is claimed that there was an oral tradition that was either folkloric1 or Rabbinic in nature2. This would indicate that persons able to write in Greek were the authors and this would probably exclude the kind of simple folk described in the Gospels as the apostles. There is dispute amongst Christian Scholars, who may take a biased perspective and historians as to whether the Gospels are accurate descriptions of the life of Jesus or alternatively whether they are simply testimonies of faith written many years after the years they describe. It is generally agreed that the Nativity, the Baptism of Christ and the Crucifixion are all based on a strongly proclaimed

7
oral tradition. These events are central to the claim that Jesus Christ was divine and they are outlined, with variations, in three of the four Canonical or Synoptic Gospels. No evidence, other than that recounted in these gospels can be found of these events.
There are at least fifty-eight known gospels or apocrypha, which were believed to have been written in the first and second centuries CE or later, all of which are based on oral tradition. The current biblical cannon incorporating the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were recognised by the Church under Pope Innocent 1st in the fifth century CE. This followed their previous recognition by the Council of Nicea in 325 CE and the Council of Rome in 382CE. The Council of Nicea was convened by the Emperor Constantine who invited 1800 bishops although only 250 and 300 bishops actually attended. The principal purpose of the council was to resolve the disagreement between the Church of Alexandria and the Arians concerning the nature of the Son in relationship to the Father. The council was in favour of the Alexandrian point of view that both the Son and the Father had no beginning. The Arians believed that the Son had a beginning and they were declared to be heretics. The Gospel attributed to John established Jesus as Logos3: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This proclamation provides a direct connection to ancient Egyptian beliefs, which connection is further exposed in The Book of Revelation, a work that is also
3 John 1,1



8
attributed by some to the same author, John. An in-depth investigation of this work might help us unravel the significance of these claims. In none of the four Gospels is there a single claim about any event that can be separately confirmed. Even significant historic claims such as the slaughter of the innocents are not recorded elsewhere.
If we examine the actions politicians and church leaders today we can see that their conduct and proclamations are designed to further their own particular view of how things should be and to persuade others to see the legitimacy of their cause, no matter how spurious or lamentable. Such political thought and manoeuvring would have been equally visible at the beginning of the Christian era. By the time that the four Canonical Gospels became legitimised and all other possible versions had been sidelined or rejected, the church was a formidable power base. Is it a co-incidence that the Synoptic Gospels, those of Matthew Mark and Luke, include a passage where Peter proclaims Jesus as the Messiah and Jesus in turn
declares Peter, who had based himself in Rome, to be the
‘rock’ on which he will build his church? The Gospels are
short documents that purport to be documentaries of Jesus
Christ’s life and teachings. It may even be significant that these pronouncements which helped secure the Church’s
headquarters in Rome (rather than Alexandria, which was
competing with Rome as the centre of the emerging Christian
theology) and its leader’s infallible link to God Almighty is
made in three of the four documents.



9
A more in-depth analysis of the way the Canonical Gospels contribute to the unravelling the mystery of Jesus Christ is made in Chapter 10.
Against heresies
In the second century, a Bishop named Irenaeus wrote a four
volume treatise entitled ‘Refutation and Overthrow of Gnosis,
falsely so called’. This learned person was born in Smyrna (now Izmir in Turkey) in 130 CE and is known to have spent time in Lyons and Rome. His book, written circa 180 CE is useful because it tells us of all the things that early Christian theologians identified as a threat to their religious formulations and beliefs. At this same time, Clement of Alexandria (150-215 CE) was teaching that men had mistakenly believed the Sun, the Moon and the other heavenly bodies to be gods. He was alluding to the influence of ancient Egyptian beliefs but his proposition had little effect on his most prominent student Origen (185254 AD) who wrote:
“Do you not see that the dragon fought
with the angels, and when he was hard pressed he was thrown down from heaven? As he fell he drew with him a third of the stars. It is likely that these stars were divine powers which had revolted with
him, and they were borne down with the
dragon, as Isaiah said, ‘How the morning
star fell from Heaven which perpetuated
the same claim”.



10
At this time, Alexandria and Rome were competing to be the rightful hub of the Christian movement. The Alexandrian philosophy was akin to and leant heavily on the Greek philosophies that had been taught by Pythagoras and Plato, where the soul comes from the heavens and returns there at death. Origin in particular studied astronomy and sought to explain early Church teachings in the context of a heaven full of stars. He included Hellenistic (ancient Greek) theories on the life and nature of stars into his cosmology. For this he was eventually condemned as a heretic by Rome but he was successful in incorporating traditional theories about the stars into biblical theology.
The ethos of the Roman school is best exemplified by ‘The Refutation of all Heresies’ a treatise published in ten parts by Hippolytus (170-235 CE), and which was almost contemporaneous with that of Irenaeus, of whom he was a disciple. It catalogues the pagan beliefs and thirty-three Gnostic Christian systems deemed heretical, making it a major source of information on early opponents of Catholic orthodoxy and/or philosophies that the Roman Church believed were threatening. Some of these philosophies/theologies had existed for many centuries prior
to the time of Hippolytus and the publication of The
Refutation of all Heresies was the first move by “The Church”
to condemn any and all teachings or beliefs that were different to its own. It must also be argued that one immediate purpose was to eliminate the influence of Alexandria. The value to us of this treatise, is that it explains clearly and unambiguously the popular beliefs of the time.



11
Amongst its compendious pages it mentions two subjects that
are of interest. In particular it outlines the belief that “The
Beast” and “The Dragon” and even Jesus (the logos) are
amongst the northern polar constellation of Aratus, Lyre, Canis, Corona, Ursa Minor and Ursa Major and gives
guidance as to where exactly they were thought to be found.
In particular, it describes Ursa Major as ‘the symbol of
Heaven, the one by which we are regenerated and which
fights against “The Beast” on our behalf’.
Along with the references to Ursa Major in The Book of the Dead, this is the most direct and unambiguous link between the key players in the Book of Revelation and the northern constellations. It tells us that this belief was prominent at the time and that Hippolytus found it necessary to include it amongst those things it was important to condemn. Taking a broad view, these emanations from Alexandria are a perpetuation of the basis of the Egyptian pantheon and show clearly that there was conflict between Alexandria and Rome regarding the core structure of Christian belief. An analysis of these beliefs and their relevance to our investigation is expanded in chapter 14.
The Epistles
There is no doubt that the work and writing of Saul of Tarsus had significant effect on the establishment of the Church. Saul was his name in Hebrew but his Roman name was Paul, which is the name we have come to know him by. He had a pessimistic mood which was the result of an illness that affected his body and his mind. He speaks of it as "a thorn in the flesh," and as a heavy stroke by "a messenger of



12
Satan" 4 which often caused him to realize his utter helplessness, and which made him an object of pity and horror5. It was most likely epilepsy, called by the Greeks "the holy disease," which created a frame of mind that may have greatly impressed his target Gentile audience. Paul had no contact with Jesus but claimed to have had a vision of the resurrected Christ. There is no indication in Paul's writings or arguments that he had received the rabbinical training ascribed to him by many Christian writers. His quotations from Scripture, which are all taken from the Greek version, show little familiarity with the original Hebrew text. It is claimed by Jewish sources that the Hellenistic literature, such as the Book of Wisdom and other Apocrypha, as well as Philo were the sole sources for his eschatological and theological system. Whatever the truth of it, Paul influenced the early Church and called on beliefs that had been carried from Egypt and Greece to elicit the support of Gentiles. He claimed that God's Messiah would put an end to the age of evil and would initiate a new age of righteousness. In Antioch, Paul reviewed Israelite history from the life of the Hebrews in Egypt to King David. In what was a duplication of ancient Egyptian theology, he taught that the ‘Resurrection’ brought the promise of salvation to believers. Paul wrote that, when Christ returned those already dead but who died while believing in Christ (as the saviour of mankind) would be brought back to life, while those still alive would be "caught up in the clouds

13
together with them to meet the Lord in the air"6. Perhaps
Paul’s most revealing comment proclaims Jesus as the new
Adam, who restored through obedience what Adam lost through disobedience.7 This is a direct link to the creation story, which had been founded in the secrets of the ancients and which pre-dated the Christian area by over three thousand years.8 It is also significant that the person known as Adam in Judeo/Christian theology was the first man on earth and therefore he must have been the first God King. For that reason he and Eve must have represented the same personalities as Osiris and Isis from the Egyptian tradition. The letters which are the Epistles, contain no direct evidence of the existence of Jesus Christ and only wishful assertions about his divine status. A more in depth analysis including letter which do not form part of the New Testament is detailed in Chapter 13.
The Book of Revelation
There are 14 mentions of Jesus in this text;
o A revelation of Jesus anointed (1.1) o (John, who confirmed) the testimony of Jesus anointed (1.2) o Jesus anointed, the martyr, the faithful one, first born of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth. (1.5)
6 1 Thes 4;14-18 7 (Romans 5:19, NIV). In 1 Corinthians 15:22 8 The God Secret by Greg Rigby



14
o ..... Kingdom and endurance of Jesus ......... and the testimony of Jesus (1.9) o And it (the dragon) went away to make war with .....(the ones) having the testimony of Jesus (12.17) o Here the endurance of the saints is, the ones keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (14.12) o And I saw the woman drunk from the blood of the saints and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus (17.6) o A fellow slave of thee I am and of the brothers of thee, the ones having the witness of Jesus to the one God worship actual testimony of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy. (19.10) o .... the souls of the ones beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus (20.4) o I Jesus sent the angel of me (22.16) o Yes I am coming quickly Amen come O Lord Jesus (22.20) o The grace of the Lord Jesus with all (22.21)
None of these give direct evidence of the actual existence of Jesus and whilst they make indirect claims that Jesus was the
teacher of a personal testimony or belief they also claim (1.5)
that Jesus was ‘ruler of the kings of the earth’ and ‘first born of the dead’. This implies a direct link to Adam and Osiris and
because of that it creates another connection to the theological traditions of ancient Egypt.



15
One topic condemned in The Refutation of all Heresies that is of interest to us in the context of our understanding of the Book of Revelation is Numerology, Isopsephia or Gematria. Interestingly, the condemnation of this subject had the effect of giving it credibility – why condemn something that has no meaning and is no threat? The arcane science of numerology involved the allocation of a numerical value to each letter of the alphabet and a numerical value to each word, it being the sum of the letters in the word. The table of Greek and Hebrew values for each letter of the alphabet is included in the appendix 1. The Greeks used a
sophisticated system, which they called Isopsephia and by the
fifth century BCE every Greek God’s name was formulated
according to isopsephic principles. It was in common Greek usage by the time of the Hellenisation of Palestine and Egypt in the second century BCE at which time it was introduced (in its final form) into Hebrew, probably simultaneous with the introduction of Square Hebrew. We can be reasonably sure that Isopsephia was used in the formulation of the Book of Revelation. This is shown by an extrapolation from the discovery of David Parker, professor of New Testament Textual Criticism and Palaeography at the University of Birmingham in England. He has been using modern technology to scour some four hundred thousand bits of papyri which were originally discovered in 1895 at a dump outside the ancient Egyptian city of Oxyrhynchus. Many of the sections have been damaged and discoloured, but a modern imaging process is shedding new light on the sacred text of the Book of Revelation. Interestingly, analysis of one piece of papyrus shows that 616 was the original number of the beast.



16
The papyrus in the spotlight (Fig 1) is believed to originate circa 300 CE and is probably about one hundred years before any other version known. The find is significant because the previously common version of the Book of Revelation created an interesting play on the numbers associated with these particular words. Below is the numerical value of each of the final words of Revelation 13, 18 in normal versions of the text.
Fig 1 The ancient Greek papyrus
And the number of it/him six hundred sixty six 31 70 430 1171 446 514 65
If the last three numbers (446, 514 and 65) are replaced by 666 (the number itself, rather than the words) then the total of the phrase becomes;
And the number of it/him six hundred, sixty six 31 70 430 1171 666 = 2368



17
The sum of this phrase is equal to 2368 and this number (2368) is the Isopsephia (numerical value) of the genitive of the words Jesus Christ. The complete verse 18 would then read (in equivalent terms)
Here the wisdom/knowledge is. The (one) having mind/insight/intention let him count the number of the beast. The actual number of man is of Jesus Christ.
The new (old) version; ‘And the number of it/him 616’,
would mean that this play on the words no longer exists and that the numerical total of the words in the phrase would be 2318. This number (2318) using Isopsephia, is equal in value to three phrases in the Book of Revelation;
“and he shall be to me a son” “and he cried (out) from the glory/splendour of him” “because of the word /computation / assertion/ proportion of the proof”.
With 616 inserted (instead of 666), verse 18 would then read (in equivalent terms):
Here the wisdom/knowledge is. The (one) having mind/insight/intention let him count; the number of the beast a number in fact (of) man is, because of the computation of the evidence/proof.



18
It would appear therefore that whoever changed the number of
‘The Beast’ from 616 to 666 did so to hide this embedded
message from the scrutiny of anyone versed in the science of Isopsephia and to lead them falsely to the name of Jesus Christ. The change itself is evidence of the very thing that the perpetrators were trying to hide, that the document was compiled using Isopsephia or numerology to incorporate hidden and perhaps sacred messages. It also shows that the document was designed to promote Jesus Christ and his esoteric associations. The spreading of the Jesus message, whether orally or via mystical texts such as the Book of Revelation would have been the 1st Century equivalent to the promotion of Harry Potter. The difference was that in those times, people believed in a vengeful God that lived in the Heavens and that (in the absence of scientific evidence to the contrary) the stories concerning God in his various forms and guises were all true. For over three thousand years such theology had been sold to unsuspecting peoples and the ground was fertile to the acceptance of variations to the ancient theme, particularly those that re-enforced the fundamentals.
If there was a person who came to known as Jesus Christ, we
will need to uncover the ways in which this person’s existence
was promoted to achieve this.
The Talmud and other Jewish writings
Most scholars believe that the Talmud references to Jesus are quite late (hundreds of years after the time referred to) and give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.



19
Several Talmudic sources include passages which identify a "son of Pandera" ("ben Pandera" in Hebrew), which are believed to be references to Jesus. A few of the references explicitly name Jesus ("Yeshu") as the "son of Pandera": these explicit connections are found in the Tosefta, the Qohelet Rabbah, and the Jerusalem Talmud, but not in the Babylonian Talmud. In the Jerusalem Talmud the name "Jesus" ("Yeshu") is found only in a marginal gloss in some manuscripts. The texts include several spellings for the father's name (Pandera, Panthera, Pandira, Pantiri, or Pantera) which are probably the same individual. In some of the texts, the father produced a son with a woman named Mary (Miriam in Hebrew). They claim that this Miriam was not married to Pandera, and was committing adultery and – by implication Jesus was a bastard child. Some of the texts claim that Mary's husband's name was Stada. Peter Schäfer states9 that there can be no doubt that the narrative of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but claims that the rabbinic literature in question are from a later Amoraic period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels. He concludes that they were most likely written as responses to them.
The most prominent Romano-Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, born CE 37, who wrote late in the first century, included two passages in his manuscripts that mention Jesus: The Testemonium Flavium10, which says;
9 Jesus in the Talmud 10 Book18, Chapter 3,3 of the Antiquities



20
“Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians,
so named from him, are not extinct at this
day”
And another inclusion in the Antiquities11 which states;
“Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he (Ananus) assembled the Sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens,
11 Book 20 Chapter 9,1



21
and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a Sanhedrim without his consent.”
The first of these references may be discounted since it is believed to have been to have been a forged inclusion by Christians. The latter reference is believed to be authentic but may be discounted on the basis that Josephus wrote about many people who were named Jesus, Yeshua or Joshua. On the other hand, it might possibly relate to the person on which the Christian religion was based. If this is case, we need to ask ourselves why Josephus was directing his readers towards James and did not include a more in-depth reference to the Christ person and to the actions it is elsewhere claimed that he performed. If it does relate to the Jesus Christ we are investigating, this passing reference would seem to indicate that the person had only passing significance at the time that this was written.
Roman records
There are no contemporary Roman records that mention Jesus Christ;



22
“The failure to chronicle Jesus Christ in
authentic history books was not because of poor Jewish or Roman record keeping. It was quite the opposite, for with care and diligence, all noteworthy Jewish historical events were accurately recorded on papyrus scrolls, goatskin or sheepskin, not
just in Judea and Galilee, but also in
neighbouring Syria and Asia minor.”12
The only records mentioning Jesus were made almost a century later but may have value in the computation of a body of evidence.
Cobelius Tacitus' work called the Annals (written circa 116 CE) is important to Christianity because it is considered by many Christians to confirm the historicity of Jesus. Book
15.44 designates Christ as a person who was executed by
Pontius Pilot during Tiberius’' reign. He wrote;
"Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous

23
superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judæa, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind"
This text would seem to confirm that there were those in Rome who had been made aware of the execution of a trouble maker in Palestine named Christ. Other records were made. One was made by Gaius Suetonius Tranquillas, who was chief secretary of the Emperor Hadrian (117-139CE) which read;
“Because the Jews of Rome caused
continuous disturbances at the instigation
of Chrestus, Claudius expelled them from
the city.” “After the great fire of Rome punishments
were also inflicted in the Christians, a sect
professing a new and mischievous religious
belief.”
Another was made by Pliny the Younger, Roman Governor of Bithinia in Asia Minor around 112CE wrote;



24
“The Christians were in the habit of
meeting on a certain fixed day before it
was light, where they sang in alternative
verses a hymn to Christ as to a God.....”
All these mentions of Christ and Christians occur in retrospect and whilst they indicate that a Christian movement was in existence, they offer only circumstantial proof of its origin and of the life and death of Jesus Christ. Despite that, some scholars quote Tacitus (above) as proof of one of the three indisputable historical events portrayed in the Gospels; the birth, baptism and execution of Jesus.
The Scrolls
The Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls were a collection of 981 different texts discovered in eleven caves along the northwest shore of the Dead Sea between the years 1947 and 1956. They were most likely written by the Essenes and/or Zadokites during the period from about 200 BCE. to 68 CE.
The first reference to the Essenes is by the Roman writer
Pliny the Elder (died c. 79 CE) in his Natural History.
A little later Josephus gave a detailed account of the Essenes
in The Jewish War (c. 75 CE), with a shorter description in
Antiquities of the Jews (c. 94 CE) and The Life of Flavius
Josephus (c. 97 CE). Claiming firsthand knowledge, he lists
the Essenoi as one of the three sects of Jewish philosophy alongside the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He relates the same information concerning piety, celibacy, the absence of personal property and of money, the belief in communality and commitment to a strict observance of Sabbath. He further adds that the Essenes ritually immersed in water every

morning, ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to charity and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the angels kept in their sacred writings. Although the Qumran community existed during the time of the ministry of Jesus, none of the Scrolls refer to Him, nor do they mention any of his follower's described in the New Testament. More detailed analysis is included in chapter 12.
The Nag Hammadi scrolls were discovered in anciently constructed caves in Upper Egypt in 1945. They incorporate
what have become known as the Gnostic Gospels and speak of
a ‘living Jesus’ who preaches illusion and enlightenment not
of sin and repentance like the Jesus in the New Testament. Some sayings in this collection criticize common Christian beliefs, such as the virgin birth or the bodily resurrection, as naïve misunderstandings. Bound together with them is the Apocryphon (literally, "secret book") of John, which opens with an offer to reveal "the mysteries [and the] things hidden in silence" which Jesus taught to his disciple John.13 This book reads like a Science Fiction soap opera spun around Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Since we know that the Adam and Eve story is based on one written in the stars as the northern pole position moved through the Heavens8 one can only assume that these texts were another attempt to link Jesus to the ancient Egyptian Mysteries. A more in-depth analysis of these connections will be made in later chapters.

Ballads and/or religious myths & traditions
There is nothing in the New Testament which tells us the
actual date of Christ’s birth. What pointers there are, such as
the shepherds watching their flocks, would seem to indicate that it was not December.
The date of December 25th was chosen in the third century to coincide with festivals honouring the birth date of prominent Pagan gods. In particular, it coincided with natalis solis invicti (the Roman "birth of the unconquered sun"), and the birthday of Mithras, the Iranian "Sun of Righteousness" whose worship was popular with Roman soldiers.
The date of December 25th followed an established tradition. Plutarch and Diogenes claimed that Zoroaster as he appeared in the Old Avestan Gathas originated prior to 6000 BCE
(albeit that recent scholars suggest dates that vary between
1800 and 600 BCE). He was born of a virgin and “immaculate conception by a ray of divine reason.” He was baptized in a
river. In his youth he astounded wise men with his wisdom and was later tempted in the wilderness by the devil. He began
his ministry at age 30. Zoroaster was baptized with water, fire
and “holy wind.” He cast out demons and restored the sight to
a blind man. He taught about heaven and hell, and revealed mysteries, including resurrection, judgment, salvation and the
apocalypse. He had a sacred cup or grail. He was slain. His
religion had a Eucharist. He was the “Word made flesh” and is
expected to return in a second coming.
The personality most similar to Jesus was the Greek God Dionysus, worshipped as early as 1500 BCE. He was



27
reputedly born of a virgin on December 25 and, as the Holy Child, was placed in a manger. He performed miracles, rode in a triumphal procession on an ass and was considered to be a sacred king. Like Christ he was killed and eaten in a Eucharistic ritual. Dionysus rose from the dead on March 25.
He was the God of the Vine, and turned water into wine. He
was called “King of Kings” and was considered the “Only Begotten Son,” Saviour,” “Redeemer,” “Sin Bearer,” Anointed One,” and the “Alpha and Omega.” Is it possible that some of
these Dionysian attributes were grafted onto the story of Jesus? The Greek Pantheon included Attis, whose cult began around 1250 BCE. Like Dionysus, Attis was born on December 25 of a Virgin. He was considered to be the Saviour who was slain for the salvation of mankind. His body as bread was eaten by
his worshippers. He was both the Divine Son and the Father.
On “Black Friday,” he was crucified on a tree, from which his
holy blood ran down to redeem the earth. He descended into the underworld and after three days, he was resurrected. The Egyptian pantheon includes Gods Osiris and Horus who have accredited to them elements that are included in the story of Jesus Christ:
Osiris was the first God-King and was therefore the same person as Adam. This person came to earth because the position of his picture in the stars changed over time from one which rotated around the pole position and was always visible to one where the figure touched earth. The key parts of the Osiris story that are similar to key parts of the Christ story are those concerning his persecution & torture, his murder and his resurrection.



28
Horus was the son of Osiris. Like Jesus he is claimed to have been conceived of a virgin. Both Jesus and Horus were the "only begotten son" of a god (either Osiris or Yahweh). Horus's foster father was called Jo-Seph, and Jesus's foster father was Joseph and both foster fathers were of royal
descent. Both Jesus and Horus had their coming announced to
their mother by an angel and Horus’s birth was heralded by
the star Sirius (the morning star) while Jesus had his birth heralded by a star in the East (the sun rises in the East). Ancient Egyptians celebrated the birth of Horus on December 21 (the Winter Solstice) while Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25th. After the birth of Horus, Herut tried to have Horus murdered. After the birth of Jesus, Herod tried to have Jesus murdered. To hide from Herut, one of the gods tells Isis, "Come, thou goddess Isis, hide thyself with thy child." To hide from Herod, an angel tells Joseph to "arise and take the young child and his other and flee into Egypt." Both Horus and Jesus were baptized in a river at age 30. Horus was baptized by Anup the Baptizer while Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. Both Anup and John were later beheaded. Both have disciples, walked on water, cast out demons, healed the sick, and restored sight to the blind. Both of them were crucified next to two thieves and were resurrected after three days. Horus is known as KRST, the anointed one. Jesus was known
as the Christ (which also means "anointed one"). Both Jesus
and Horus have been called the good shepherd, ‘the lamb of God’, the bread of life, the son of man and the Word.



29
In summary, none of these coincidences to traditional mythologies tell us whether the person of Jesus Christ existed. What they do suggest, is that the personality that did exist (assuming that he did) was probably embellished and that stories were attributed to him to associate him with the qualities and traditions of God figures that would have been known to those living in Israel and its surrounds at the time.
As we have already seen, the mythology of Attis, Osiris and Horus included their resurrection. Other examples of Gods who were resurrected include the ancient Near Eastern, Greek, and Norse deities Baal, Melqart, Adonis, Ashmun and Tammuz. The cult of Baal was prominent in the 14th century BCE and Semitic races celebrated resurrection as a part of the Canaanite fertility rituals. Melqart, whose name means "king of the city" was the patron god of the Phoenician city of Tyre and one of the major gods of the Phoenician and Punic pantheons. He was also known as Baal Sur (Lord of Tyre) and was identified with Herakles (Hercules) since at least the sixth century BCE. During an annual ritual, the god "died" (perhaps in a fire) and was awakened or resuscitated, perhaps through a sacred marriage (hierosgamos) with the goddess Astarte.
The name Adonis derives from Semitic origin and is a variation of the Phoenician Adon meaning "Lord." The name Adonis also bears striking resemblance to Adonai, one of the names used to refer to Yahweh, the singular God of the ancient Israelites. Adonis became an avid hunter, and ended up being killed by a wild boar during the hunt. Aphrodite, his wife mourned feverishly, pleading to Zeus for the renewed life



30
of her lover. Zeus was swayed by Aphrodite's pleas, and eventually resurrected Adonis.
According to Damascius, Eshmun was the eighth son of Sydyk, whence his name, and the chief of the Cabeiri. Whereas they were dwarfish and misshapen, he was a youth of most beautiful appearance, truly worthy of admiration. Like Adonis, he was fond of hunting in the woods that clothe the flanks of Lebanon, and there he was seen by Astronoë, the Phoenician goddess, the mother of the gods (who sounds similar to Astarte), who hounded him to such an extent that to escape her he was driven to the desperate resource of selfemasculation. Upon this the goddess, greatly grieved, called him Paean, and by means of quickening warmth brought him back to life, and changed him from a man into a god, which he thenceforth remained. The Phoenicians called him Esmun, 'the eighth,' but the Greeks worshipped him as Asclepius, the god of healing, who gave life and health to mankind.14
Tammuz (Damuzu) was thought by some to be the same
person as Adonis. He is reputed to rise from the dead annually
and, after half a year, descend to the ‘Netherworld’ for the
other half. He is mention in the Old Testament;
"Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women
14 George Stanley Faber, The Origin of Pagan Idolatry Ascertained from Historical Testimony and Circumstantial Evidence, vol. 2 (London: 1816), 262



31
weeping for Tammuz. Then said he unto to me, 'Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these."15
Like the tradition of 25th December and the virgin birth, we see that the resurrection of a God King was a deeply established concept at the beginnings of the Christian era. Some authors and historians have suggested that the end December tradition was centred on the time of the Winter Solstice.
Fig 2 Nut as mother of Heaven
15 Ezekiel; 8; 14-15



32
It was at this time that new life started as the sun commencing
its new emergence and that ‘resurrection’ occurred around the
time of the Spring Equinox, which was the point at which light fully conquered darkness and the Sun took complete dominance of the heavens. There are more recent stories and traditions, which are thought to have been linked to ancient religious beliefs and whose traditions may hide some clues; The Grail story and the Tarot (for instance) contain the common elements of the cup, the spear or rod, the sword and the pentacle/pentagram or stone. These four elements are closely linked to the ancient mysteries and that they appear in the New Testament as the cup of the Eucharist and the spear of Longinus but are linked more intricately to Christ and Christianity through the Book of Revelation.8
The ancient mysteries emanate from patterns created in and around the seven stars that are at the centre of the constellation of Ursa Major, when this constellation had control of the northern pole position in the early part of the third millennium BCE. In this cosmology the pentagram was held in the cup of the constellation, represented by the shape of Nut the mother of God and this shape was therefore the sacred shape of the Son of God (Ra) and the Mother Goddess. It is possible therefore to create an obtuse link between the mystical claims concerning Jesus as portrayed in The Book of Revelation to the ancient mysteries of Egypt and its related
cosmology. Despite this, none of the intriguing links provide
tangible proof of Jesus’ existence and only point to a
compendium of intended ambiguity and associated intrigue.



33
Perhaps when we examine the manifest desire to perpetuate the ancient mysteries and beliefs in the Christ story we will find clues to the existence of the personality around which the stories were re-presented.
Fig 3 The pentagram traced round the face of Osiris as depicted on the walls of the Tomb of Senedjem; Servant in the place of Truth
Another personality that appears in compendious documents
and legends is that of Satan or ‘the devil’. This personality
who had many names comes from an ancient source and because of that the idea of an evil being in conflict with God
was well establish in the Egyptian pantheon. Plutarch,
speaking of his own days16, says: “The power of Typhon,
16 On Isis and Osiris, Chapter XXX; Plutarch



34
although dimmed and crushed, is still in its last agonies and convulsions. The Egyptians occasionally humiliate and insult him at certain festivals. They nevertheless propitiate and soothe him by means of certain sacrifices.” In some instances this being was portrayed as a threatening dragon. A concept that is long standing and which is based on the conflict between the star constellations Bootes, Ursa Major and Ursa Minor and the constellation Draco for their possession of the Pole position (the place at the centre of the heavens around which everything rotates).
The name Satan is a Hebrew word meaning adversary. In the God Secret8 we show clearly that the picture of Satan can be obtained by joining stars in the Ursa Major constellation. This picture can be seen at night when the pentagram inside the constellation of Ursa Major has rotated through 1800 Because of that the shape represents the opposite of God, whose hidden configuration in the constellation, when the constellation has rotated 1800 around the pole position and it is hidden by the
Suns brightness in the day. The stories told by Egyptian and Hebrew priests over the years re-enforced the idea that Satan was a real personality who was in conflict with both God and man. The fact that this personality is picked up in the Gospels17 is a clear indication of the degree to which this tradition was maintained and that Hebrew belief influenced the writers. The stories in the Gospels concerning Jesus being spoken to and tempted by Satan are an indication of how real this tradition had become. It is also a good early indication of the human predisposition to blame someone or something else
17 Matthew 4; 1-11, Mark 1; 12-13, Luke 4; 1-13



35
for the way we as individuals see things. To attribute such human frailty to God incarnate is a blasphemous insult at worst or an acceptance that the personality being written about was in fact human and not divine at best.
In summary, the written evidence for Jesus Christ’s existence
is limited and is confined to claims of the effect of his existence rather than proof of his existence. There seems to consensus amongst historians (oftentimes biased Christian historians) that the birth, baptism and execution of Jesus Christ did in fact take place. Some elements of these events as reported are mysterious in themselves and may give us a starting point for further investigation. Additionally, the reports of Christ that do exist seem to incorporate connections to ancient beliefs that are inherent and fundamental to the Ancient Mysteries, as they were believed and practised in Egypt. This too suggests a route worthy of further examination.

Chapter 2 The Hebrew connection to the Egyptian pantheon/mysteries
Important Canaanite populations first appeared in Northern Egypt towards the end of the 12th Dynasty (circa 1800 BCE), and between that time and 1720 BCE they formed an independent realm in the eastern Nile Delta. The Canaanite rulers of the Delta, regrouped during the 14th Dynasty, and coexisted with the Egyptians during the 13th Dynasty, based in Itjtawy. The power of the 13th and 14th Theban dynasties progressively waned, and circa 1650 BCE Egypt was invaded by the Hyksos, a Semitic people including some Hurrians and Hittites who formed their own Egyptian dynasty, the 15th Dynasty, and created their own northern power base in the city of Avaris. Eventually Seqenenre, Tao Kamose and Ahmose defeated the Hyksos in battle and expelled Khamudi, their last king, from Egypt circa 1550 BCE. As both Hyksos and Hebrews were Semitic groups and were immigrants into Egypt from Canaan and beyond, and because the earliest Israeli and Egyptian historians tells us so, the Hyksos have been confused with the Hebrews. The name Hyksos was used by the Egyptian historian Manetho (300
BCE), who, according to the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus
(1st century BCE), translated the word as “king-shepherds” or
“captive shepherds.” Josephus himself wished to demonstrate the great antiquity of the Jews and thus identified the Hyksos with the Hebrews of the Bible. There is no doubt that there was an intermingling of Hyksos and Hebrews. The Old Testament tells us that Joseph stood



37
before Pharaoh as an interpreter of dreams18 and it seems
likely that this was a Hyksos Monarch who ceded a choice
parcel of land to Joseph’s family.19 Josephus cites Manetho’s history which associated the
Israelites with the Hyksos;
“After the conclusion of the treaty they left with their families and chattels, not fewer than two hundred and forty thousand people, and crossed the desert into Syria. Fearing the Assyrians, who dominated over Asia at that time, they built a city in the country which we now call Judea. It was large
enough to contain this great number of men
and was called Jerusalem.”20
Many modern scholars see problems with Manetho’s
combining of the expulsion of the Hyksos and the Biblical narrative. Manetho lived many centuries after these events
took place, and his reading of events may well have been
inaccurate. Most historians believe that Ahmose’s defeat of
the Hyksos occurred centuries before the traditional date of the Exodus. In addition, the basic premise of the Hyksos and Exodus histories differ: the Hyksos were expelled rulers of Egypt, not slaves, and they were forced out, not pursued. If Manetho was correct, then Hebrews would have been
18 Gen; 41:14-37 19 Gen 47; 6 20 Josephus, Against Apion 1.73.7, quoting Manetho’s Aegytiaca



38
included amongst the rulers of Egypt – an idea which we will return to. There is an alternative explanation that might solve these differing views: It was the Hyksos Kings and pretenders that were expelled by Ahmose. After the Hyksos were defeated by this Pharaoh, some Hyksos people probably remained in Egypt, perhaps as a subjugated class. This is upheld by the fact that the Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut recorded the banishment of a group of Asiatics from Avaris, the former Hyksos capital many years later. (1489–1469 B.C.E.) During this time, they probably mingled with the many other Semitic peoples occupying parts of Northern Egypt. This being the case, there would have been two minor Hyksos expulsions, the one by Ahmose and the one by Hatshepsut followed by the Exodus of the Old Testament many years later. There is considerable debate concerning the actual date of the Hebrew Exodus. We are told that the Hebrews spent 430 years in Egypt.21 If this is correct, we would need to know the date of the first settlement in order to compute the date of leaving. If the settlement occurred between 1800 and 1720 BCE, this would date the Exodus to somewhere between 1370 and 1310 BCE. The rulers of the Eighteenth Dynasty were:
 Nebpehtire Ahmose 1 - c.1550-1525 BCE  Djeserkare Amenhotep 1 - 1541-1520  Aakheperkare Thutmose 1 - 1520-1492  Aakheperkare Thutmose 11 - 1492-1479  Menkheperre Thutmose III - 1479-1425
21 Exodus 12,40



39
 Maatkare Hatshepsut, a rare female ruler 1473-1458  Aakheperrure Amenhotep 11 - 1425-1400  Menkheperure Thutmose 1V - 1400-1390  Nebmaatre Amenhotep 111 - 1390-1352  Neferkheperure-waenre Amenhotep 1V Akhenaten - 1352-1334  Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare (Co-regent and successor of Akhenaten. The identity of this individual is uncertain and disputed. Usually believed to be either a son or son-in-law of Akhenaten but sometimes identified as Akhenaten's wife Nefertiti. Other scholars distinguish two individuals between Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, namely Smenkhkare, who is then seen as male, and a female ruler, who is then most often identified as Akhenaten's eldest daughter Meritaten) 1334-1333  Nebkheperure Tutankhaten/Tutankhamun 1333 1324  Kheperkheperure Ay - 1324-1320  Djeserkheperure-setpenre Horemheb - 13201292
This fits well with the contentious claim that Moses, the person who led the Israelites out of Egypt was the unorthodox pharaoh Akhenaten who conveniently disappeared from history after his attempt to have the Egyptian religion amended. His crime was to change the Egyptian pantheon from a series of gods or aspects of god with different names



40
and to limit the act of worship so that it was directed at/to one single God, the God Aton. Whilst the detail changes, this too
fits with the Old Testament tradition, that Moses prosecuted
the theological concept of ‘one god’.
Since antiquity, many writers have tried to associate Moses with Akhenaton including Manetho, who claimed that the founder of monotheism, whom he called Osarsiph, assumed
the name Moses, and led his followers out of Egypt in
Amenhotep’s reign. The spectre of Akhenaton was also
transformed into Moses by writers such as Lysimachus, Tacitus and Strabo. Agreeing with this school of thought was Sigmund Freud22 who described himself as thinking the unthinkable and more recent authors such as Donald B
Redford and Ahmed Osman.
The name Moses means ‘son of’ or ‘born of/from’ and
because of that, it was a common epithet, particularly to those in high positions. The name Mose was normally attached to a named suffix as it was with the name Ahmose and meant son
of Ah.
Use of ‘Moses’ on its own would have been abnormal. It could
possibly have been used where the suffix (the father) was assumed. If this was the case, the father would need to have been well known and might confirm the speculation that Moses was the son of the Pharaoh. Whatever the timings and the true pedigree of Moses, it is certainly the case that the Hebrews/Israelites left Egypt and were in all likelihood pursued by the enemies of Moses. The number of people involved is the subject of debate, depending on the way the original Hebrew text is interpreted.
22 Moses and Monotheism” (New York: Knopf, 1939)



41
Calculations vary from 100,000 to 600,000 up to as many as 21⁄2 million. This higher figure would approximate to half the total population of Egypt and is extremely unlikely. Whatever the true numbers, it is clear from the claims made in the book of Exodus that there were disagreements between the Moses and the bulk of the migrants accompanying him;
“When the people saw that Moses delayed to
come down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, "Up, make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him." And Aaron said to them, "Take off the rings of gold which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me." So all the people took off the rings of gold which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron. And he received the gold at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made a molten calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord." And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people



42
sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
play.”23
The peoples making up the Exodus were descendants of those who had lived in Egypt for over 400 years. They had been born in Egypt and intermarried with Egyptians. It is not surprising therefore that a sizeable number of them had adopted the religion of Egypt and worshipped the many
traditional Gods of their adopted land. According to the verses
in Exodus, even Moses’ trusted advisor and lieutenant, Aaron,
(who is described in Exodus as the brother of Moses) was a follower of the Egyptian pantheon and was happy to facilitate worship of the golden calf. Hathor, who was among the oldest of Egyptian deities, was often depicted as the cow, a cowgoddess, sky-goddess and tree-goddess. She was the mother to the pharaoh and earlier mother to the universe. She was undoubtedly the golden calf of the bible, and was also the Goddess of love and music. The calf as displayed in Thebes contains the same angles of a regular pentagram displayed in the traditional picture of Nut (Figure 2 above) Moses was the principal proselytiser of the new religion based on the veneration of a single god and on his reappearance from the mountain we are told;
“And when Moses saw that the people had
broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to their shame among their enemies), then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Who is on the Lord's side? Come to me."
23 Exodus; 32 1-6



43
Fig 4 The Calf displayed in Thebes
And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him. And he said to them, "Thus says the Lord God of Israel, 'Put every man his sword on his side, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.'" And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. And



44
Moses said, "Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the Lord, each one at the cost of his son and of his brother, that he may bestow a blessing upon you this day."24
Given Moses’ instructions it is surprising that only three
thousand people were put to the sword. This might be an indication that the group was smaller than some religious historians have claimed. The two passages read together tell us;
The group travelled in fear and the new religion was prosecuted with force
Women were spared
These might encourage the deductions that;
o There was a deep felt love of the old religion – so much so that people gave up their wealth to help create a calf of gold.
o The old religion was sent underground by Moses actions
o Any women secretly holding onto the old religion were free to pass it discretely to their children.
24 Exodus 32; 25-29



45
This being the case, we can assume that any rejection of the Egyptian pantheon was made by the leaders of the Semitic group leaving Egypt for Israel and that this rejection did not necessarily mirror the views of the ordinary people. If we go back in The Book of Exodus to a time prior to the flight, we are told that as part of his forceful negotiation, Moses called a series of plagues onto Egypt, the last of which involved the slaughter of the first born;
4 So Moses said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout
Egypt. Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 6 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt—worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 7 But among the
Israelites not a dog will bark at any person
or animal.’ Then you will know that the
LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel 8 All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and
saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who
follow you!’ After that I will leave.” Then
Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh25
25 Exodus 11; 4-8



46
This makes it clear that the Israeli hierarchy were violent in the prosecution of their demands but it gives no information about the views of those they represent. Interestingly, the phraseology is such that Moses could have been talking about
himself in the third person (as royals do) when he used the
epithet ‘Lord’.
Later descriptions of these events have been sanitised. Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles tells us;
37 “This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me
from your own people.’ 38 He was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass
on to us.
39 “But our ancestors refused to obey him.
Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts
turned back to Egypt. 40 They told Aaron, ‘Make
us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow
Moses who led us out of Egypt—we don’t know
what has happened to him!’ 41 That was the time
they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and revelled in what their own hands had made. 42 But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon and stars. This agrees
with what is written in the book of the prophets:
“‘Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel? 43 You have taken up the tabernacle of Molek



47
and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you
made to worship. Therefore I will send you into
exile’ beyond Babylon”26
The above quotation makes it clear that the aspects of the Egyptian religion that had been brought out of Egypt and
which was violently repressed were those relating to worship
of the ’sun moon and stars’.
We do not know where Stephen obtained his information other than from Exodus 20 and from Amos 5; 26 which stated;
“You carried along the statues of the
god Sikkuth/Moloch as your king
and the star Chiun/Kiyyun, the gods you made
for yourselves”
What we do know is that he spoke of things that his audience
were aware of: The God Moloch (MLK) he mentions went by
many names including Ba’al, Apis and Milcom and was
widely worshipped in Egypt among the Canaanites, (the people occupying the land which is now Northern Egypt) who considered him a fertility deity and one of the most important gods in the pantheon.
As a Semitic common noun baal (Hebrew baʿal) meant
“owner” or “lord.” The tabernacle of Molech is more difficult
to identify, but in the context of ‘sun, moon and stars’ it may
well represent the shape of the tabernacle (fig 4) and the shrine
26 Acts7; 37-43



48
which in turn holds the pentagram or star as identified in The
God Secret.8
Fig 4 The tabernacle that surrounds the seven stars of Ursa Major, which holds the shrine
In the earliest of times the tabernacle held the shrine and over time these titles replaced one another so that the tabernacle became the innermost sanctuary. This means that an altar or



49
stand shaped like the inverted cup of Ursa Major could have
been referred to as ‘the shrine’. If this analysis is correct, the ‘star of your God Rephan’ will
relate to the 5-pointed star that was synonymous with the Egyptian God Osiris and with the earthly God Kings that followed him.
Fig 5 The figure of Ursa Major, its cup and the five pointed star as duplicated on the ground in Northern Europe
In Israel, the 5-pointed star has in more recent times been changed to a six-pointed star and this new shape has become known as the Seal of Solomon and the Star of David. The instigator of this change and the date when it happened is unknown. The appellation does not mean that the two symbols of Solomon and David were six-pointed. In fact, the little



50
evidence that exists points to the contrary and that the Seal of Solomon was a pentacle. There was no history of a six-pointed star in Egypt. The only
pre-historical references relate to a occasional finds in
Babylon and a find in ‘the shrine that opens out from the palace at Mallia’ (constructed circa 1900 BCE)27
All references to a six-pointed star linked to Israel appear to commence in recent history. If there was any change in ancient times, it is possible that it came from the transposition of the triangle that made one of the sides of the heavenly pyramid.
There was a close and enduring link between Egypt and the Canaanite peoples. The little evidence we have suggests that despite early deadly pressure from Moses, this link was not demolished at the time of the Exodus.
This supposition was confirmed at the highest level when
Solomon “.... became allied to Pharaoh, king of Egypt by
marriage, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about."28
These links continued until the time of Jesus, when, relating
to the impending ‘slaughter of the innocents’, the Gospel of
Matthew tells us;
27 Yavneh; page 83 footnote by Raz Kletter, Wolfgang Zwickel and Irit Ziffer. 28 Kings 1, 3.1



51
“And when they were departed, behold, the
angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the
prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my
son.”29
and then again, briefly:
“But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.”30
Such links with Egypt as a place of safety is not surprising as
there was a large Jewish community exiled in Egypt at the
time of Jesus: “The presence of a large number of Jews,
attracted by special advantages offered by Alexander and renewed by Ptolomy 1, when the city was in its infancy, admitted the worship of Jehovah. An Aramaic papyrus31 tells us that this worship was not, however entirely new to Egypt, for a large colony of Jews had settled under Darius in the
29 Matt. 2: 13-15 30 Matt. 2 19 31 Sachau, Aranaische Papyrus und Ostraka aud Elephantine, Leipzig 1911; Sayce and Crowley, Aramaic Papyri 1906



52
immediate neighbourhood of the first cataract and had built a
temple there, apparently becoming prosperous and having
established an important colony.”32
Another important link between Israel and Egypt was in the actual name of Israel. El was used by the Canaanites as the name of the chief God of their pantheon. The Ugaritic texts, the major extra-biblical source on Canaanite religion, describes El as a grandfatherly figure who was revered by the Canaanites as the father of the gods, the father of humans, and the Lord of Heaven. Major decisions considered by the other
Gods in the pantheon had to be approved by El. The word
comes from a root word meaning ‘might, strength, power’. In Scripture, the primary meanings of this root are ‘god’ (pagan
or false god), ‘God’ (the true God of Israel). Re, also spelled Ra, or Pra, in ancient Egyptian religion, was god of the sun and creator god. He was believed to travel across the sky in his solar bark and, during the night, to make his passage in another bark through the underworld, where, in order to be born again for the new day, he had to vanquish the evil serpent Apopis (Apepi). As one of the creator gods, he rose from the ocean of chaos on the primeval hill, creating himself and then in turn engendering eight other gods. Originally most solar gods had falcon form and were assimilated to Horus. By the 4th dynasty (circa 2575 – 2465 BCE), however, Ra had risen to his leading position. Syncretism were formed between Re and other gods, producing such names as Re-Harakhty, Amon-Re, Sebek-Re,
32 Philip David Scott Moncrief, Paganism and Christianity in Egypt 1913



53
and Khnum-Re. Aspects of other gods influenced Re himself; his falcon-headed appearance as Re-Harakhty originated
through association with Horus. From the 4th dynasty, kings
held the title “Son of Re,” and “Re” later became part of the throne name they adopted at accession. As the father of Ma’at,
Re was the ultimate source of right and justice in the cosmos. At Thebes, by the late 11th dynasty (circa 1980 BCE), Re was
associated with Amon as Amon-Ra, who was for more than a
millennium the principal god of the pantheon, the “king of the gods,” and the patron of kings.
Is- (ισ-) is a prefix meaning equal, literally “divine-power
synchronized.” The prefix ίσ figures prominently in Greek
words pertaining to politics, mathematics, and knowledge.
Thus, the word Is-ra-el meant ‘El (and) Ra; divine power synchronised’ or ‘El (and) Ra equal’. This etymology
indicates that the originators of the State of Israel recognised
the ‘divine power’ of the principal Egyptian and Canaanite
deities. In summary therefore, the ancient culture of Egypt was inculcated into those that left to live in Israel. Additionally, as we have demonstrated, because of constant migrations and inter-communication between the two neighbours, the immediate pre-Christian era was a time when there was a deep respect in Israel for the beliefs and traditions of Egypt.

Chapter 3 The Ancient Mysteries and their connections to Christianity
The links between the ancient Egyptian Mysteries and the Christian polemic is most obviously created via the Book of Revelation. This book uses mystical language to weave a
story around the seven stars of Ursa Major. It mentions ‘the
seven stars’ five times and the text makes it clear that this
group of stars somehow embraces a throne and four living creatures (a calf, an eagle, a lion and the face of a man) and the names of God in Egyptian, Greek and Hebrew, as well as a series of other shapes such as the lamb, the sickle, the Alpha and the Omega and the tabernacle. With only a small amount of research all of these figures can be easily located in the vicinity of the Ursa Major constellation.33
The author of The Book of Revelation tells us that he is John
and it has been assumed by students of theology that he was
‘John of Patmos’. He claims he had a vision in which Jesus
relayed information to him. In particular, he tells us that Jesus said; I Jesus .... am the star bright the (one) of morning34
...and I will give to him (the father) the star, the (one) of morning.35

35 Rev; 2,28



56
And from Jesus anointed, the witness the (one) faithful, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth .......36
Crucial to our analysis, is a correct interpretation of ‘the morning star’. Some authors have claimed that it refers to
Venus, other Sothis or Sirius. Others claim that it was Horus37. These claims indicate that the connection is likely to be with Egypt where the pyramid texts tell us;
The sky will weep for you and the earth shake for you, the Moorer will scream for you and the great Mooring Post cry out for you, feet stomp for you and arms wave for you, as you go forth to the sky as a star, the morning god. Pepi has come to you, his father has come to you, Geb.38 O Osiris Pepi, Nut your mother, spreads herself above you, She conceals you from evil, Nut protects you from evil, You the greatest of her children ..... 39
These lines make it clear, that the most esoteric meaning of
the term ‘morning star’ was as a reference to Osiris. He was
the star in the body of Nut (Ursa Major) that was to accompany/ferry the sun across the sky following its rising.

57
The second reference in The Book of Revelation above, refers
to Jesus as the ‘the firstborn of the dead; and ‘the ruler of the kings of the earth’. These designations also place Jesus as
Osiris, since it is likely that the firstborn of the dead was the first man on earth. The ancient tradition was that the first
person on earth was also the first God King. If this
explanation is valid, Osiris would have been the ‘firstborn’ in
the Egyptian pantheon the one whom all the Pharaohs were
descended from.
An alternative explanation might be that the definition ‘the first born of the dead’ referred to Osiris role as God of the
afterlife. The Book of the dead is a compendium of spells and prayers that are extracted from Ancient Egyptian tombs and funereal texts. They tell us;
“Osiris was the god of the underworld and was
the god that made a peaceful afterlife
possible”40
The second title; ‘ruler of the Kings of the earth’ completes
the picture since this identifies the person as the first King and
father of the ‘kings of the earth’ (the pharaohs) and must
therefore be Osiris.
Osiris became (known as) the great Ancestorgod of Egypt, and was a reincarnation of his great-grandfather41

58
This picture of Osiris is best confirmed by the opening hymn in the Book of the Dead;
“Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King
of the Gods, whose names are manifold, whose forms are holy, thou being of hidden form in the temples, whose Ka is holy. Thou art the governor of Tattu (Busiris), and also the mighty one in Sekhem (Letopolis). Thou art the Lord to whom praises are ascribed in the nome of Ati, thou art the Prince of divine food in Anu. Thou art the Lord who is commemorated in Maati, the Hidden Soul, the Lord of Qerrt (Elephantine), the Ruler supreme in White Wall (Memphis). Thou art the Soul of Ra, his own body, and hast thy place of rest in Henensu (Herakleopolis). Thou art the beneficent one, and art praised in Nart. Thou makest thy soul to be raised up. Thou art the Lord of the Great House in Khemenu (Hermopolis). Thou art the mighty one of victories in Shas-hetep, the Lord of eternity, the Governor of Abydos. The path of his throne is in Ta-tcheser (a part of Abydos). Thy name is established in the mouths of men. Thou art the substance of Two Lands (Egypt). Thou art Tem, the feeder of Kau (Doubles), the Governor of the Companies of the gods. Thou art the beneficent Spirit among the spirits. The god of the Celestial Ocean (Nu) draweth from thee his waters. Thou sendest forth the north



59
wind at eventide, and breath from thy nostrils to the satisfaction of thy heart. Thy heart reneweth its youth, thou producest the.... The stars in the celestial heights are obedient unto thee, and the great doors of the sky open themselves before thee. Thou art he to whom praises are ascribed in the southern heaven, and thanks are given for thee in the northern heaven. The imperishable stars are under thy supervision, and the stars which never set are thy thrones. Offerings appear before thee at the decree of Keb. The Companies of the Gods praise thee, and the gods of the Tuat (Other World) smell the earth in paying homage to thee. The uttermost parts of the earth bow before thee, and the limits of the skies entreat thee with supplications when they see thee. The holy ones are overcome before thee, and all Egypt offereth thanksgiving unto thee when it meeteth Thy Majesty. Thou art a shining Spirit-Body, the governor of Spirit-Bodies; permanent is thy rank, established is thy rule. Thou art the welldoing Sekhem (Power) of the Company of the Gods, gracious is thy face, and beloved by him that seeth it. Thy fear is set in all the lands by reason of thy perfect love, and they cry out to thy name making it the first of names, and all people make offerings to thee. Thou art the lord who art commemorated in heaven and upon earth. Many are the cries which are made to



60
thee at the Uak festival, and with one heart and
voice Egypt raiseth cries of joy to thee.”42
So here we have it, the descriptions of Jesus in The Book of Revelation give us a direct link to Osiris and, if this is what is intended, they must designate Jesus as the five pointed star in the Heavens and the reincarnation of the first God King, Osiris. The Book of the Dead makes it clear that Heaven, the place where all the various aspects of God are is in the vicinity of the Constellation of Ursa Major. This is confirmed by the
famous astrological zodiac on the ceiling of the temple at
Dendera, which shows ‘the thigh’ (Ursa Major) at its centre.
Fig 7 The ceiling at Dendera

61
This is not surprising since the pole position (the place in the sky around which everything appears to revolve was located in and around Ursa Major during the period when the Egyptian pantheon evolved. Another quote from The Egyptian Book of the Dead tells us;
‘Here I am; I have come to you that you may
drive out all the evil which is on me just as you did for those seven spirits who are in the suite
of the Lord of Sepa, whose places Anubis made
ready on the day of ‘Come thence’.
Who are they? As for those gods the Lords of Justice, they are Seth and Isdes, Lord of the West. As for the tribunal which is behind OsirisImsety, Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuef, it is these who are behind the Great Bear in the Northern sky........ O Re, ...... may you save me from that god whose shape is secret, whose eyebrows are the arms of the balance, on the night of the reckoning of the robbers. Who is he? He is Sheshmu, he is the mutilator of Osiris. Otherwise said: He is Apep, he has only one head which bears righteousness. Otherwise said: He is Horushe has two heads, one bearing right and one bearing wrong; he gives wrong to whoever does it and right to whoever comes with it. Otherwise said: He is Horus the Great preeminent in Letopolis.



62
Otherwise said: He is Thoth Otherwise said: He is Nefertum, son of Bastet.
These are the tribunal who take action against
the enemies of the Lord of All’43
This gives us clear and unequivocal proof that Ursa Major, the constellation of the Great Bear, was thought by the Egyptians to be the home of the Royal Court. This court appears to consist of three key personalities or aspects with other less significant gods or aspects of the same god in support:
o Osiris, the god contained within Bear in the Northern Sky;
o Re or Ra who has the power to protect the supplicant against the power of the Gods;
o The God whose ‘shape is secret’, the Lord of All
who is the mutilator of Osiris and could either be the invisible God who is associated with the Pole position (around which Ursa Major rotated at that time) in the northern Sky or the God described in the Book of the Dead whose eyes are in the position of the wings of Isis and whose shape (to the onlooker) changes as it rotates around the pole position each day.
The goddess Isis, who is described as both the wife and sister of Osiris is located in the same place and her wings overlie

63
the eyes of God. (the arms of the constellation on either side of the cup).
“Beneficent in command and word was Isis the
woman of magical spells, the advocate of her brother. She sought him (Osiris) untiringly, she wandered round and round about this earth in sorrow, and she alighted not without finding him. She made light with her feathers, she created air with her wings, and she uttered the
death wail for her brother. (Who had been
killed and been dismembered by Seth)”44
It is a separate entry that tells that the eyes of God are located in the position of the wings of Isis;
“As for the plumes on his head, it means that Isis and Nephthys (another version of Isis) went and put themselves on his head when they were the Two Kites, and they were firm on his head. Otherwise said: They are the two great and mighty uraei (winged serpents), which are on
the brow of his father Atum. Otherwise said:
The Plumes on his head are his eyes.”45
44 The Papyrus of Ani. Book of the Dead; E A Wallis Budge 45 Spell 17, Book of the Dead, R O Faulkner



64
Fig 8 The winged figure of Isis
These extracts correspond well with one of the most provocative statements in the Book of Revelation;
“And were given to the woman the two wings of the eagle the (one) great in order that she might (fly) to the desert to the place of her where she is nourished there a right place/time and right places/times and half of right
place/time/proportion/circumstance of/from a
face of the serpent.”46
The Book of the Dead quotations imply that the plumes, which are the wings of Isis, are the eyes of God. The locations of the eyes of God are the extensions on either side of the four principal stars of Ursa Major. This means that the wings of Isis should be similarly positioned, thus placing the head and torso of Isis over the four central stars of the constellation.
46 Rev; 12,14



65
Fig 9 The wings of Isis in the same location as the Eyes of God (inset)
In this co-incidence of shapes, one aspect of Isis (and therefore God) overlies the eyes of God. By implication therefore, it overlies the face of God. This location of Isis is one of the clearest visual insights into the concept of differing names and aspects of one and the same God, a view that is a confirmation of spell 17, above.
Apart from the identities and locations of the three God personalities, there is a co-incidence between the Book of the Dead and The Book of Revelation, which leads us to the undeniable conclusion that these texts refer on the one hand to Jesus and on the other to Osiris and that they are both talking about aspects of the same personality. This conclusion is confirmation of two additional similarities between the Jesus and the Osiris stories that we previously noted. The first was that they had the same birthday and the second that they were both murdered and resurrected.



66
More direct references to Jesus in the Bible that can be cross
referenced to Osiris describe Jesus as someone that ‘will judge the living and the dead’
He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.47
I charge/testify before God and Jesus Christ who shall judge the living and the dead and by his appearing and his kingdom. 48
In relation to similar claims made for the God King Osiris we are told;
(so) thou sittest upon the throne of Osiris, thy ‘bȝ-sceptre in thy hand, thou commandest the living49
In the Pyramid Texts, the rapid growth of individualized ethics, as well as Osiris's assumption of the role of "judge of the dead" are not yet discernible, although the king is truly Osiris.50
47 Acts; 10,42 48 2 Timothy; 4,1 49 Utterance 213; 134b Pyramid texts translated by A B Mercer 50 Escaping Osiris, Wim van den Dungen



67
When Osiris comes back to life, however, he never returns to the land of the living, but remains in the underworld, The Duat, where he rules as King of Eternity and supreme judge of the dead.51
When the dusk is in your sight, you wardens of Osiris, do not restrain my soul or hold back my shade; open a way for my soul and my shade; that it may see the Great God within the shrine on the day of examining souls52
This similarity of description and qualities between Jesus and Osiris seems to imply that to find an explanation for the Jesus story we should perhaps look closer at the Osiris inheritance and in particular the way it might have existed at the time of Jesus Christ. At this stage you (the reader) may be tempted to believe that this all sounds like mumbo jumbo. How could an examination of the Osiris tradition give us an understanding of the existence of a person named Jesus, born from humble parents
in a small town in Palestine? How was this person chosen as
the one who would be called Messiah and ‘Son of God?
We propose that the answer to these questions must be
somehow related to Jesus’ anonymity or that it is contained in a direct link between Jesus and Egypt and Egypt’s ancient
beliefs?

68
If it is the former, as has been claimed by ‘The Church’ over
the centuries then there is no rational explanation. It is “a
question of faith” that Jesus was chosen by God incarnate to be born as a man, die and rise again. This appeal to ‘faith’ is
not new and has been used by the Christian hierarchy to discourage those who want to research the origins of the Jesus story. If on the other hand, linking Jesus with the Osiris personality is real and was intended, the only logical explanation to such connections stretch the limits of credulity and would certainly create dissonance amongst Christian believers. The only hypothesis that would fit the facts is that Jesus was thought to be a vessel of the Egyptian royal blood and a direct descendant Osiris. At first announcement, such a hypothesis would seem to be utterly incredible. However, if such a link to the Pharaonic bloodline can be shown to have been the case, the claims made by recent authors53 and popularised by the movie The Da Vinci Code would assume a new and more impelling significance.
To investigate such a hypothesis - for a direct link from the Pharaonic blood line to an actual person named Jesus Christ we will need analyse all the available facts concerning;
o The Pharaonic blood line, its progression and inheritance and the views of its incumbents and those commanded by its presence
53 The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail by Richard Leigh, Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln



69
o The Egyptian Kings/Queens and the state and perception of the royal blood line at the time of Jesus birth
o The annunciation and the birth of Jesus
o The Baptism of Jesus
o The death of Jesus
o The people who grew the myth and their motivations
o What has happened since the time of Jesus
As with all historical analysis, the findings will produce only circumstantial evidence. Writings from the time were interpretations of facts and beliefs as transcribed by their authors. In the case of the Egyptians mysteries and beliefs, we are helped by the existence of significant and lasting monuments and texts, which were constructed at the time that the beliefs were existent. Because of this, we will assume therefore that the information we retrieve and use was based on the actual beliefs of the priests and Pharaohs of the time.
Everyone has the right to believe whatever they wish, unless the expression their beliefs are judged by the rest of humanity
(or by those making the rules) to be evil or inappropriate. The
teachings by ‘The Church’ that Christians must have ‘faith’ in
the Bible and the claim that the Bible is a sacred text that has



70
been given by God have been believed by ‘the faithful’ for
centuries. As science expands our awareness of the Universe and the origins of life, these tenants of Christian belief and their origins must be open to rational examination.
If the story of Jesus Christ is not about a divine being, given
today’s interpretation of what that that means, then the trust
that the faithful has maintained in the Gospel and its teachings will have been misplaced. The blood that has been shed in the defence of the doctrine of Christianity will have all been for nothing.
For all of these reasons, and (if we can) in order to shed some
light on ‘the truth’ it is essential that we investigate this
mystery further and attempt to find an answer.



71
Chapter 4 The Royal Bloodline
The divinity of the pharaoh was an essential element in his claim to legitimacy;
“Scholars were long ago familiar with doctrines of the ’king’s two bodies’, earthly and divine
(Lanny Bell 1985) and of his divine birth and
succession.”54
“The conception of the ideal king – divine
descent, warrior prowess, reverence towards the gods, and wealth coupled with generosity towards his subjects – fits well into both
Egyptian and Hellenistic ideology (Samuel
1993:181)”55
This divinity of the Pharaoh was most easily claimed by having a manifest physical link back to Osiris, the first GodKing, a link that was established via lineage and genealogy. For this reason, we first need to discuss the validity of the Pharaonic blood line.
The list of Pharaohs from the first known incumbent is detailed in Appendix 2. The bulk of this list came from work by Manetho, who was an Egyptian priest from Heliopolis.
54 The Last Pharoes; J B Manning 55 Ibid



72
Under the patronage of Ptolemy I, he started to compile an Egyptian history, titled Aegyptika. It was written in Greek and finished circa 271 BCE. Manetho attempted to describe Egyptian history from its inception and rule by Cronos and Osiris to Alexander the Great. His original work was lost, and all we now have are extracted from short transcripts and
summaries created by Christian historians in later centuries. A
few different translations of Manetho’s work exist:
 Josephus Flavius, from the first century CE  Sextus Julius Africanus, third century CE  Eusebius of Cesarea, third/fourth century CE  George Syncellos (a Byzantine historian) from the eighth century CE.
Mistakes made in translation and by copiers reduce the value of Aegyptiaca as an historical document. Most of the dates simply don't match. However, Manetho is the basis for most of the chronologies and naming conventions for Egyptian pharaohs. His king list is often referenced by Egyptologists, some of who claim that there seems to have been some political hay made by exaggerating the reigns of some of the kings and by minimizing others. Significantly, Manetho traced the kings back to pre-dynastic period when Egypt was
ruled by gods and demi-gods. He lists Cronos, Osiris and
Typhon as the first gods who ‘held sway in Egypt’ and Orus
as the first demi-god. The entire concept of "dynasty" comes from Manetho, who broke apart the kings into reasonably logical groups -- by location or family or other identifying feature. The Manetho list is supplemented by the incorporation of kings from the



73
Turin list, the Palermo stone and the Abydos Kings list which is inscribed on the walls of the temple of Seti.
 The Turin kings list is also known as the Turin Royal Canon. It is an Egyptian hieratic papyrus thought to date from the reign of Pharaoh Ramses II, now in the Museo Egizio (Egyptian Museum) in Turin which gives details of 18 kings reigning in the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties. In
this papyrus the God Kings in the pre-dynastic period are
listed and include Osiris, Horus, Thoth and Ma’at.
 The Palermo stone, often known as the Royal Annals is an important primary source. It originates from the end of the fifth dynasty (25th century BCE). The stone annotates mythical pre-dynastic kings of Egypt followed by pharaohs from the first five dynasties. Each Pharaoh
had up to five names, which were chosen to represent the
individual’s personality, their devotion or affiliation to a
particular god;
o A Horus name
o A Nebty name (attaching the person to a name of the Goddess o Golden Falcon Name o Formal name o Informal name (the name most often referred to)
A description of the stone and its contents is eminently described in the works of Cedric Leonard;



74
“Since ancient kings often had more than one
name, phonetic agreement between the Palermo Stone and other king-lists is not really necessary. Most Egyptologists seem to be reasonably sure of the top line containing the names of the godkings, even though it is obvious that most of the glyphs are badly worn. Regardless, I am offering alternate readings in certain instances to point out the possibility of actual phonetic agreement. Although portions of nine of the original ten god
king's names are in evidence, only seven of the
names are complete. The first two king’s names
are almost entirely missing, as well as the last one of the ten (reading from right to left). The remainder of the top line containing demi-god kings (the left portion) is broken away. Each name is contained within a "box" (not really a cartouche) made of horizontal and vertical lines. The names are very simple—usually indicated by two glyphs each (three in some cases). Directly below each king's name and attached to the "cartouche" (box) is the hieroglyphic determinative for "god-king". I believe a few of the glyphs merit an alternate reading from that which has been provided by the experts. Immediately below is a photo of the top line of hieroglyphs, which may be compared with my reconstruction (farther below) of the names. The first name is completely broken away, and only a piece of the second name shows on the Palermo Stone (far right). The first complete



75
name (the third king) seems to read "Ska". Egyptian spellings being as fluid as they are with the passage of time, this could later have become the Shuor Su of the Turin Canon. Next (reading to the left), I believe the strangely-slanted ovalshaped glyph (thought to be an H) is in reality a very worn side of the goose "Seb," (its legs and head no longer visible). The glyph below it seems to be a reclining animal of some sort, but it's very faint and nearly impossible to be read with any assurance. The goose by itself can be read "Seb". The third complete name starts with a very small glyph which is nearly unreadable. Egyptologists have taken it to be the common glyph (a loaf) for T, but it could possibly be a not so common glyph (a small loop) for S. The next glyph, a reed (Y), is not very clear either. The bird glyph looks like a chick (U); but should it be a swallow (WR) it would read SYWR: I think it possible that this name is "Ausar," the Egyptian name for the god Osiris. The fourth "cartouche" from the right has two very wide "rectangular" shaped glyphs. The experts see the top one as a rope glyph and the bottom one as a rectangle, but they are damaged and I believe the reverse to be just as possible (I don't have the stone itself to look at). The rope represents a T or TH, and the rectangle an S or SH. They have, therefore read it TSH; reverse this sequence, and it reads SHT, or the god-king Set.



76
At the top of the next cartouche is a rather long, thin line, which Egyptologists assume to be a wavy line, the letter N. From what I can see, this is impossible: it looks straight, not wavy. It appears to be one of the uncommon versions of the letter H (a club). Below this is a very obscure glyph, which could well be the swallow glyph,
UR or WR. Therefore, I read this as Hwr
(Egyptian for Horus)”56
One of the key aspects of the Egyptian religion was that every
king could be traced back to Osiris. This way they could
claim to be God Kings, or ‘Sons of God’. For this to happen,
the bloodline would have needed to be unbroken from Ra and Osiris and the Palermo stone attempts to show that this is the case up to the end of the fifth dynasty.
“From the beginning pharaohs were considered
gods – the embodiment of Horus while living and
living on as Osiris after death.”57
The traditional lineage of the pharaohs from the Fifth Dynasty was descent from Ra, who once ruled Egypt. All pharaohs were descended from
Ra and a mortal mother. Pharaohs were always
titles ‘Son of Ra’.58

77
 The Abydos King List, also known as the Abydos Table, is a list of the names of seventy-six kings of Ancient Egypt, found on a wall of the Temple of Seti 1 at Abydos. It consists of three rows of thirty-eight cartouches (borders enclosing the name of a king) in each row. The upper two rows contain names of the kings, while the third row merely repeats Seti I's throne name and praenomen. Besides providing the order of the Old Kingdom kings, it is the sole source to date of the names of many of the kings of the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties, so the list is valued greatly for that reason. This list omits the names of many earlier pharaohs who were apparently considered illegitimate — such as Akhenaten, Hatshepsut, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamen and Ay.
When tracing through the list of kings from the first recorded king up until the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty, several aspects become obvious;
o To ensure that the bloodline is intact and ‘sacred’ it
is oftentimes passed via daughters as well as sons. On some occasions, there is intermarriage between brother and sister. (There have even been suggestions that the lineage was passed via the female line and that this inter-marriage was organised to secure the kingship). In various Egyptian texts Isis is referred to as the wife and as the sister of Osiris and is perhaps this belief in the twin role of Isis that gave the incestuous practice legitimacy.



78
o The intervention of the Hyksos kings did not interrupt the parallel bloodline that maintained the links back to Osiris. Ahmose 1, the first pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, defeated the Hyksos. This which was the last dynasty to rule Egypt before the break
created by Ramesses 1. The eighteenth dynasty
commenced what is known as ‘the new kingdom’.
There are several occasions where there appear to be a break in the lineage, the principal ones being;
* The taking of the Pharaonic crown by provincial governors between the 6th and 12th dynasties
* The beginning of the 19th dynasty when the throne was taken by Ramesses I (1293 BCE)
* The beginning of the 25th dynasty when Nubians invaded Lower Egypt
* The beginning of the Macedonian and Ptolemaic dynasties by Alexander the Great (332 BCE) and the continuation by Ptolemy I
Records for the 200 years following the end of the 6th dynasty are incomplete. Neferkare VII (circa 2140 BCE) was the third pharaoh of the 9th dynasty and his name suggests that he considered himself a legitimate successor of Pepi II Neferkare (2278 – 2184 BCE) of the 6th dynasty. This link also applies to Neferkare VIII, the second pharaoh of the 10th dynasty,



79
(circa 2130 and 2040 BCE) succeeded by Merykare the last king of this dynasty who presided over the Herakleopolite Kingdom and who attempted to maintain a policy of peaceful co-existence with the adjacent Theban kingdom. If this is a valid analysis, we can reasonably assume that the chronology was valid until the end of the 10th dynasty. The Theban 11th dynasty reunified Egypt and held power from 2140 until 1991 BCE when Amenemhat I took the throne. Many of these pharaohs took a Horus name and declared themselves to be rulers of the whole of Egypt. Sehetepibre Amenemhat I was the first ruler of the 12th dynasty but it is thought not to have been of royal lineage and is believed to have had no direct blood link with the pharaohs
of the 11th dynasty. If there was a link it must have come
through the female line. This pharaoh, who’s name meant ‘renaissance’ worked to re-unite the ‘two lands’ and to re
establish the old order. Like politicians today, he was a master
of propaganda and ‘spin’. The importance of his legal right to
the throne was enhanced by the writing and publication of a
supposed (ancient) prophecy; ‘The Prophecy of Neferti’. This
prophecy predicted the advent of a future king called Ameny;
‘who will restore order to the country’. This literary work together with the Pharaoh’s most notable
composition, the Instructions of Amenemhat and, in architecture, the reversion to the pyramid-style complexes of the 6th Dynasty rulers are all considered to have been manifest attempts to legitimize his rule. The son of his successor Senwosret III is claimed to have been worshipped as a god for



80
many centuries after his death,59 indicating that Egyptians at the time believed him to be a legitimate God King. There is some debate amongst historians concerning Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep I, (1802 – 1800 BCE) the first pharaoh of the 13th dynasty. The records indicate that he reigned close in time to Amenemhat III and this seems to indicate that he was the son of Amenemhat IV of the 12th dynasty.
We can see, from this brief analysis that it is that it is impossible to accurately cite evidence of a direct and unbroken bloodline from the first Kings to the end of the 13th dynasty. What is evident, is that those kings whose claim to title was suspect, went to great lengths to legitimise their rule through the adoption of full names, the issuing of texts and by
the construction of pyramids and other monuments.
Many of the pharaoh’s wives have the title ‘King’s daughter’
indicating that they were the daughter of a pharaoh but in some instances, such as Neferu I, the first identified queen of the 11th dynasty, it is not possible to specify precisely which pharaoh is the father. It is of course possible that the pharaohs did legitimise their reign by their choice of queen but we have no evidence of this, other than acknowledged tradition. The first pharaoh of the 19th dynasty was Ramses I. ‘His birth
name, Ramesses (Ramses Paramessu) means "Re has
fashioned him’ or ‘Son of Ra’. His throne name was Menpehtyre, which means "Eternal is the Strength of Re’.
Horemheb’s selection of Ramesses as his successor seems to
59 The complete Royal families of Ancient Egypt; Aiden Dodson & Dyan Hilton



81
have been carefully thought out. This is illustrated by the fact
that Ramesses I chose the Golden Horus name of ‘He who confirms Ma’at throughout the Two Lands’, thus indicating
his desire to carry on the work of Horemheb in re-establishing
religious order after the heretic rule of Akhenaten. Ramses’
name and titles also stress the privileged nature of his
relationship with Re or Ra, the sun god’.60 The name, ‘Son of Ra’ is key evidence of his claim to part of the Royal Line and
of his own divinity.
Historians tell us that ‘Ramses I was previously the Vizier,
close friend and confidant of the pharaoh Horemheb who having failed to produce an heir – appears to have bestowed his succession upon his comrade. Ramses must have been of
advanced years, probably in his fifties, and was not of royal
blood.’61
One author on the subject makes a tenuous link which is difficult to substantiate;
“Ramses I was about 75 years old when he died
in about 1290 BCE, meaning that he must have been conceived in about 1365 BCE. This date lies squarely within the reign of Amenhotep III the father of Akhenaton. ..... The only historical information we have about Ramesses I states that his father was called Seti – so which Seti in this era would have been his father? One possibility is evident from the works of Manetho. I have previously identified Armais (Dannus) as being
60 King Ramesses !; Jimmy Dunn 61 Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Samy Salah



82
the Armana pharaoh Ay. But, according the Manetho, Armais had a brother called Sethos (Seti) who was also called Argyptus. Since Ay was the brother-in-law of Amenhotep III (and could have been his cousin) it is likely that this Sethos (Seti) was of the right era and age to have been the father of Ramesses I. If this is so, then it would mean that the nineteenth dynasty was simply a continuation of the eighteenth, through a
very closely related strand of the Armana
family.”62
After a short reign of two years, Ramses I was succeeded by his son Seti I, who had held the same titles of Vizier and Troop Commander as his father. In order to restore Egyptian fortunes after the instability under the Armana kings, he
inaugurated a programme of major construction. He took the
additional title of’ ‘Repeater of Births’ signifying the
beginning of a new and legitimate era. On the basis of inscriptions in the temple of Abydos, the
parents of Seti I are assumed to be Ramesses I and Sitre.
However, a stele carved under Ramesses II claims Seti I’s
mother to be named Tia, the same name as the wife of Amenhotep III – a link which was perpetuated when Seti named his daughter Tia and Ramesses II (his son) named his
daughter Tia-Sitre.
One of Seti’s most significant constructions was the grand
Temple at Abydos which incorporated the Abydos King List. The list contains the names of 76 kings of ancient Egypt,
62 Eden in Egypt; Ralp Ellis



83
predecessors whom Seti acknowledged to be legitimate pharaohs. On the other hand, rulers who were considered illegitimate, such as Hatshepsut and Akhenaten were conveniently omitted from the List. The list was arranged in three rows, each containing 38 cartouches. The first two rows
consisted of the names of his predecessors and the third row is
just a repetition of Seti I’s throne name and other names.
The Abydos King List, together with the temple reliefs showing Seti being anointed and crowned by the gods, as well
as the dedication of the entire Abydos site to Osiris were
actions that proclaimed the legitimacy of Seti I’s rule and the
authenticity of his claim to dynastic succession. The pharaoh’s divinity – his relationship and kinship with the gods – was proved by being the son and heir of a divine pharaoh, whose wife had conceived him from the gods or, failing this, by mythology that convinced the world that the king was a
heavenly father.
Seti’s actions indicate that he was fully aware of the
importance of the blood line that connected the Pharaohs back
to Osiris and made their ‘God’ status legitimate. Logic tells is
that given this awareness, if there was any question of his own legitimacy, it was very probable that Seti would ensure that his son; Ramses II (who was to succeed him) would marry someone who carried the blood of a legitimate queen or king from the 18th dynasty. Since there is no evidence of this, we must assume that Seti I assumed believed that he had a direct claim to the throne and that his reign perpetuated the bloodline. Ramesses II came to the throne at the age of 25 and reigned 67 years. He would have been conceived in 1304 BCE, which means that like his father and grandfather he was conceived in



84
the Armana period. In his case, this would have happened when Horemheb was on the throne and abundant progeny of Amenhotep III existed. History has named him Ramesses the Great, reflecting the fact that no other pharaoh constructed as many temples or erected as many colossal statues and obelisks as he. He had many wives, but he had two principal wives,
Nefertari and Istnofret whom he married at least ten years
before Seti’s death. Nothing has been able to be proved of
their ancestry. If there was a break in the bloodline, the first three pharaohs of the 19th dynasty did nothing to betray it. Their names and the messages carved on their abundant constructions confidently claimed their divinity and their links to the line from Osiris. In all probability there existed connections through marriage, but there are no records to prove this one way or the other. In any event, their actions proclaimed the importance of the bloodline and re-enforced its importance for future generations.
Following this interruption to the bloodline (if that is what it was), the Egyptian crown was passed from Nubian, to Assyrian to Libyan, to Persian and Greek Monarchs over an 800 year period that started with the 20th dynasty in 1190 BCE and culminating in the invasion by Alexander in 332 BCE. The Nubians invaded Lower Egypt and took the throne of Egypt under Usermaatre Piye although they already controlled Thebes and Upper Egypt in the early years of Piye's reign. Piye's conquest of Lower Egypt in 752 BCE established the
25th Dynasty which ruled until 656 BCE. His first wife Tabiry
had the title ‘kings daughter’ indicating that she claimed to be
the daughter of a pharaoh. Her father was Alara, a Nubian



85
king who has been variously claimed to have been Ary Meryamun and Aryamani (Usermaatre Setepenre) (785 778). If this is the case then the bloodline is protected through
her.
Piye’s father Kashta, had attempted to pre-empt the problem
of legitimate succession some years earlier;
Kashta's appearance as King of Upper and Lower Egypt and peaceful takeover of Upper Egypt is suggested both "by the fact that the descendants of Osorkon III, Takelot III and Rudamun (765 762) continued to enjoy a high social status in Thebes in the second half of the 8th and in the first half of the 7th century [BCE] as is shown by their burials in this city as well as the joint activity between the Divine Adoratrice Shepenupet I and the god's Wife of Amun Elect Amenirdis I, Kashta's daughter. A stele from Kashta's reign has been found in Elephentine (modern day Aswan)--at the local temple dedicated to the god Khnum—which attests to his control of this region. It bears his royal name or prenomen Nimaatre. Egyptologists today believe that either he or more likely Piye was the Year 12 Nubian king mentioned in a well-known inscription at Wadi Gasus which associates the Adopted god's Adoratice of Amun, Amenirdis, Kashta's daughter together with Year 19 of the serving God's Wife of Amun, Shepenupet. Kashta's reign length is unknown.



86
Some sources credit Kashta as the founder of the 25th Dynasty since he was the first Kushite king known to have expanded his kingdom's influence into Upper Egypt. Under Kashta's reign, the native Kushite population of his kingdom, situated between the third and fourth Cataracts of the Nile, became rapidly 'Egyptianized' and adopted Egyptian traditions, religion and culture.63
Alexander III of Macedon (356 –323 BCE), commonly known as Alexander the Great was a King (Basileus) of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the
Argead (Greek) Dynasty. Doctor Joanne Foster describes
Alexander’s impact on Egypt and its Royal dynasty. We are
told that;
“After conquering Persia's naval bases all along
the coastline of Asia Minor and Syria-Palestine, Alexander marched south into Egypt where he remained for some six months. Although generally regarded as little more than an eccentric diversion, Alexander's Egyptian sojourn was essential to his future plans. He needed a strong coastal base for both strategic and commercial purposes, from which he could not only communicate across the Mediterranean but which could also handle the highly lucrative seaborne trade network he wanted to divert from
63 The Kingdom of Tush; Laslio Torok



87
Phoenicia. With naval reinforcements following his progress down the coast, his Macedonian army covered the hazardous 130 mile distance in
only a week to reach the heavily fortified coastal
town of Pelusium in late October 332 BCE”
With his reputation going before him, Alexander was met by Egypt's Persian governor Mazaces. With no armed forces and with no likelihood of any assistance following the defeated Darius' swift departure back east to Persia, Mazaces simply handed over the treasury's 800 talents and "all the royal furniture". In return he was kept on as part of the new administration together with the new governor Cleomenes, who was made responsible for finance and created the royal mint around 331 BCE. Cleomenes was a hard-headed, unscrupulous businessman who quickly amassed a personal fortune of 8,000 talents during his career as governor. Yet he remained loyal to Alexander with whom he kept up a regular correspondence, sending him such delicacies as smoked quail by the thousand. After installing a garrison at the key defensive site of Pelusium, Alexander then ordered his fleet to sail south up the Nile to the traditional capital Memphis (Inebhedj) at the apex of the Delta where he himself would arrive by land at the head of his troops. Passing by the ancient religious site of Heliopolis (Iunu) with its vast white temples and obelisks, Egypt made an enormous impression on both the Macedonian troops and their 24 year old leader.



88
Brought up with his formidable mother Olympias' tales of Egyptian gods, the religiouslyminded Alexander must have been completely dumbstruck in a land so steeped in ritual, where priests held enormous power wielded inside temples not built to human scale. Passing by the great pyramids of Giza, still gleaming in their
shining white limestone, he finally reached
Memphis to a genuinely rapturous reception.”64
The obvious break in the bloodline caused by the assimilation
of a conquering Macedonian king was solved in retrospect, at
least conceptually, by what has become known as ‘The
Alexander Romance’. This document was composed and
written in Alexandria by an unknown author ‘whom certain
manuscripts falsely name as Callisthenes, kin of Aristotle and
companion and historian of Alexander the Great’65 some time
before the 4th century AD. In elaborate prose, the romance tells how Nectanebo II (the last king of the 30th dynasty, the final dynasty of native Egyptians) fled to Macedon when Egypt was invaded by the Persians. After his departure, the Egyptian God of the
underworld Sinopos delivered an oracle, which promised that
“That King of yours who fled (Nectanebo) will come again
into Egypt, not having aged, but rejuvenated. He will subdue
your enemies the Persians.” In the meantime, Nectanebos uses
sorcery to seduce Olympias the Queen of Macedonia who

89
subsequently gives birth to Alexander, the son of Nectanebo and person who was later to drive the Persians out of Egypt. In this scenario, Alexander is a direct descendent of Nectanebo and has legitimate claim via the bloodline to be pharaoh of Egypt
The Alexander Romance was written many years after
Alexander’s death and represented myths which grew from
the short time Alexander spent in Egypt (332 – 331 BCE). During that time he instituted remarkable constructions and did everything to present himself as a divine pharaoh. Persia had occupied Egypt for 180 years since the end of the 26th dynasty in 525 BCE. They have appointed a series of governors to rule the territory. Dr Joann Fletcher explains;
“The Persians showed relatively little respect for
the ancient traditions and were deeply unpopular, and the Egyptians' had rebelled so often that parts of the country remained virtually independent. Because of this Alexander was hailed as Saviour
and Liberator, and as the people's choice and
‘legitimate heir’ he was offered the double crown
of the Two Lands. Anointed as pharaoh in Memphis on 14 November 332 BCE, the culmination of his coronation was the climactic moment when the high priest named him 'son of the gods' according to traditions dating back almost 3,000 years. Always a devout man who began each day with sacrifices to the gods, Alexander had no difficulty worshipping the Egyptian deities. Equating their gods with his own, he worshipped



90
the Egyptian Amun as a form of Zeus. At the Memphite necropolis of Sakkara the new pharaoh offered sacrifices to the Apis bull, a cult animal of the creator god Ptah, followed by Greek-style games and literary contests in which performers from all over the Greek world took part in a multi-cultural extravaganza. These kinds of events mark the beginnings of Hellenism in their blending of Greek practices and local traditions, and Egypt and Greece would successfully coexist for the next 3 centuries. Alexander is reported to have attended lectures given by the Egyptian philosopher Psammon where he debated the inter-relationship between Greek and Egyptian theology and custom. For two months he resided as 'living god' in the royal palace at Memphis, studying Egyptian laws and customs at first hand, he gave orders for the restoration of the Egyptians' religious centres, including the great southern temples of Luxor and Karnak, where he appears in the company of the Egyptian gods wearing traditional Egyptian regalia including the rams horns of Amun as worn by his Pharaonic predecessors including Amenhotep III. Alexander's image was replicated all over Egypt in both monumental statuary and delicate relief, together his with his Greek name translated into hieroglyphs enclosed by the royal cartouche: "Horus, the strong ruler, he who seizes the lands of the foreigners, beloved (son) of Amun and the



91
chosen one of Ra - meryamun setepenra Aleksandros".
It tells us much that he undertook a perilous desert march to consult the Oracleat Aghurmi. On arrival, he went immediately to the temple of Amun. Plutarch tells us that according to his sources, Alexander was met by the Siwan high priest who greeted him with the words "O, paidion", "Oh, my son", but mispronounced the Greek as "O, pai dios" meaning "Oh, son of god", much to Alexander's delight and amazement. The small number of his party waited in the temple forecourt, and after the high priest announced to all present that the god was content, they could proceed with their questions. One of the Macedonians asked the Oracle whether they might give their king divine honours, to which the reply came "This would please Ammon". Then in his capacity as pharaoh and high priest of all the gods, Alexander was led into to the heavily-scented darkness of the inner sanctuary to put his questions personally to the god himself. When he finally emerged into the daylight, he was met by his friends anxious to know exactly what had transpired. Alexander would only say he had been given 'the answer his heart desired'. That the main subject discussed had been the nature of his divine paternity seems the most likely, since he was adamant that the only other person he would tell these 'secret



92
prophecies' to would be his mother, and as he told Olympias in a letter this would only be face to face on his return to Macedonia. Alexander left Egypt in the spring (mid-April) of 331 BCE having had massive impact on Egypt and having consolidated his own claims to power and influence. Although he would never return alive to see the city he had founded, it would eventually be his final resting place when his
embalmed body was returned there for burial ten
years later”66
The ground work done, Ptolemy I (305 – 285 BCE) was
Alexander’s appointed successor and together with his
descendants, he adopted Egyptian royal trappings and added
Egypt's religion to the Greek tradition, worshipping ‘the gods of Eternity’ and building temples to them. They were even
mummified and buried in sarcophagi covered with hieroglyphs. This adoption of Egyptian culture was the real secret to Ptolemy’s rule and that of his descendants. Alexander came and left, as an Emperor and God King, bringing the rest of the world under his influence, but Ptolemy saw the need to rule according to the customs and traditions of the people he was to rule. The famed Satrap Stele, on which is carved a decree from Ptolemy (from the same period as his installation as ruler) reads; "I Ptolemy, the satrap, restore to Horus, the avenger of his father, the territory of Patanut [Egypt], from this day forth
66 Alexander in Egypt; Alan M Fildes & Dr Joann Fletcher



93
forever..." In addition to showing respect for the Egyptian religion and beliefs (something previous conquerors had failed to do), this inscription reminded the people exactly who it was who had liberated Egypt from the Persian Empire, thus ensuring much support for the new ruler and the dynasty that would follow him.
The perpetuation of the Pharaonic dynasty via Ptolemy I Soter
(Saviour), Alexander’s successor was attempted in two ways; first via the ‘will & testament’ of Alexander and secondly by the actions of Ptolomy, after Alexander’s death. The Alexander Romance tells us; “And Perdikkas thought
that Alexander would leave all his goods to Ptlomeos because he had often spoken to him of Ptlomeos' lucky birth. And
Olympias, too, had made it clear that Ptlomeos had been
fathered by Philip (Alexander’s official father)” It goes on to speak of Alexander’s spoken will allocation; “..... Egypt goes
to Ptlomeos, and let him be given as wife Cleopatra, the sister
of Alexander, ruler of the brave.” Being the son of Phillip
might have helped secure the Macedonian throne but it did
not help with any claim to the throne of Egypt. The main
thing that helped Ptolemy’s claim to legitimacy was that
Alexander, the divine God King willed Egypt to him. There is much written about the parents of Ptolomy: Everyone agrees that his mother was Arsinoe but historians disagree about her conception of Ptolemy. On the one hand it is claimed that she was spouse of Lagus and on the other, that she was a concubine of Phillip II and that Ptolemy I was the result of this association. Whatever the truth of it, the fact that there was claim of a direct link between Phillip and Ptolemy indicates that the concept of legitimate and continuous lineage was thought to be important in a Macedonian context.



94
Ptolemy was shown to be aware of the importance of lineage in relation to Egypt by his sponsorship of Manetho who traced the pharaohs back to Osiris and brought the concept of "dynasty" into the public domain when he published his Aegyptika.
The motivation of Ptolemy to establish legitimacy could well
explain the myth surrounding Alexander’s tomb: “In 2002,
Andrew Chugg, an English aerospace expert and
Egyptologist, resurrected the idea that Alexander had indeed
been interred in the pharaoh’s sarcophagus. The argument was
based on old ideas suggesting that in the rush to bury Alexander, Ptolemy had placed the royal mummy in the empty sarcophagus made for, but never occupied by, Nectanebo II. This event it was said, may have inspired the
confused legend enshrined in The Alexander Romance that
Nectanebo II was Alexander’s real father, making Alexander
the legitimate pharaoh of Egypt. The scattered, ambiguous evidence from the ancient writers Pausanius, Curtius and Diodorus was combed for clues, which were reinforced by the findings of Auguste Mariette at Memphis-Saqqara.”67 The significance of the divine lineage to Ptolomy I was transmitted and manifested by his son, Ptolemy II
Philadelphus. This is nowhere better explained than by A E
Samuel who tells us: “It is also clear that the dynastic cult of
the Ptolemies never spread throughout the Mediterranean world in the way that we find the worship of Isis and Sarapis did; and this may well indicate a difference in the attitude toward it. In any case, as Dunand points out, the Ptolemies were not directly involved in the propagation of these cults,
67 Alexander’s Tomb; Nicholas J Saunders



95
and their establishment for the most part was a matter of individual initiative. The dynastic cult was largely a phenomenon restricted to Egypt itself, and that has been taken to mean that it existed only where it was supported directly by the crown. On the other hand, cults of individual sovereigns, kings and queens, dedications and temples, combine to show members of the dynasty were treated as divinities, either individually or in assimilation to other deities in Egypt. Similarly, the evidence of sculpture, like the many small stone heads of Philadelphus which were attached to bodies of cheaper materials like wood, are inexplicable unless they were used as cult figures by private persons. Thus, despite all the uncertainties in the material, there is no doubt that the idea of the Ptolemaic monarchy definitely included a notion of the divinity of the king, a notion which extended to the Greeks and Macedonians and was established in the ideology as early as the middle of the reign of Philadelphus.68
All in all, these stories about the actions of Ramesses, Seti I, Alexander, Ptolemy and Piye and the significant historical
writings that support them indicate clearly that the lineage of
the ‘God Kings’ was important to them. Even non-Egyptians
such as Alexander became enraptured by the glorification
provided by the Egyptian tradition and by the ‘divine’ powers
it bestowed upon its earthly kings. In those cases where the genealogical succession is unable to be traced, any actual succession would have been achieved through an unknown female line. However, during the years since the enthronement of Ramesses I at the beginning of the
68 The Ptolemies and the Ideology of Kingship; A E Samuel



96
19th dynasty (1292 BCE) which included invasion by Nubians, Assyrians, Libyans, Persians and Greeks, it is difficult to plot a direct line. The last dynasty that can claim an unbroken connection back to the first pharaohs and thus to Osiris was the 18th dynasty. Whether the line was continuous or not, the Pharaohs all made an effort to proclaim their legitimacy and their right to the titles that the kingship bestowed upon them and in doing so
they re-enforced the importance of legitimate inheritance of
the title ‘Son of God’ and of the line back to Osiris.



97
Chapter 5 The Son of God
As we saw in Chapter 2, the word Moses derives from the
Egyptian word mes or mos which means ‘son’. This word was
incorporated into the name of many Egyptian pharaohs.
Dedumose Kamose Ahmose Thutmose Rameses
With the exception of Dedu, the prefixes of these names, Ka, Ah, Thut and Ra were all Egyptian spiritual entities – Ka, the spiritual essence of the soul, Ah the God of the Moon, Thut the architect God of the universe and Ra, the God who created
all forms of life.
Because of this, Thutmose (for example) was ‘Son of Thut’ or, in simpler terms, ‘Son of God’. These designations were most popular from the commencement of Ahmose I’s reign at
the beginning of the eighteenth dynasty (circa 1550 BCE), a dynasty that included the rule of Thutmose III. (In Chapter 7 we will discuss how this may have been significant) The full name of the pharaoh consists of five names. Examples of some of these names are given in the list of pharaohs detailed in appendix 2. The name titles were;
The Horus name The Nebti name



98
The ‘golden Horus’ name
The prenomen The nomen
a) The Horus-name
“The oldest known part of the royal titulary is the Horus-name
, sometimes also called the banner-name or the Ka-name. It represents the king as the earthly embodiment of the god Horus, the divine prototype and patron of the Egyptian kings. This name is ordinarily written within a rectangular frame, at the bottom of which is seen a design of recessed panelling, such as we find in the facades of early tombs and in the false doors of many private tombs. The Ancient Egyptian name for this facade was ‘serekh’. On the top of the serekh is perched the falcon of Horus, hence the appellation "Horus-name". In more elaborate New Kingdom examples Horus is wearing the double crown and is accompanied by the sun and an uraeus (a stylised upright cobra worn as a head ornament). In the Early-Dynastic Period, the perched falcon of Horus was in fact part of the name of the king. Aha, for instance, was actually called Horus-Aha, "Horus who fights". The Horus Name was not the birth name of the king, but it
was given to him when he ascended the throne. During the
first three dynasties it was the king’s official name. His name
of birth would not appear in official documents. This has complicated the identification of many early kings mentioned in the king lists, where only the name of birth is mentioned.



99
Although it would continue to be used throughout the entire Ancient Egyptian history, it lost its importance to the Prenomen en nomen from the end of the Old Kingdom on.
b) The Nebti-name
The Nebti-name shows the king in a special relation to two goddesses: the vulture-goddess Nekhbet of the Upper Egyptian cities of Elkab and Hierakonpolis and the cobragoddess Uto of the Lower Egyptian city Buto. Both goddesses are the deified personification of Upper and Lower-Egypt respectively, and as such, the Nebti-name denotes the king as "the one of Nekhbet (Upper-Egypt) and Uto (Lower-Egypt)", i.e. as the "one belonging to Upper and Lower Egypt". It is often translated as "Nebti" or "The Two Ladies". 1st Dynasty king Den is the first to have assumed this Nebtiname. The use of this title by Den may perhaps indicate some governmental reforms that may have occurred during this king's reign.
c) The "Golden Horus” name
The meaning of the third part of the royal titulary, the
"Golden Horus” name , is more disputed. It represents the falcon god Horus perched on a symbol that usually represents "gold". Based on the Greek equivalent of this title on the Rosetta Stone, which translates into English as "superior to (his) foes", it has been proposed that the hieroglyphs symbolised Horus as victorious over Seth, "the Ombite" (another possible reading of the hieroglyph on which the falcon is standing).



100
This was, no doubt, the interpretation during Greek times, when the opposition between Horus and Seth was much more
pronounced than in earlier times. Significantly, it was a period
when the ‘pole position’ had moved out of Draco into ‘Ursa Minor’, the constellation that was synonymous with Horus. If the "Golden Horus name" symbolised Horus’ victory over
his enemy Seth, one might expect that the names following this group should be aggressive in nature, but most of the time, those names are far from being bellicose. In a context dealing with the titulary of Thutmosis III that king says "he (Amun) modelled me as a falcon of gold". Thutmosis III’s co-regent Hatshepsut calls herself "the female Horus of fine gold". The concept of the golden falcon can be definitely traced back to the 11th Dynasty. An inscription of the 12th Dynasty describes the Golden Horus name as the "Name of gold". The notion of "gold" is strongly linked to the notion of "eternity". The burial chamber in the royal tombs of the New Kingdom was often called the "golden room", not (only) because it was stacked up with gold, but because it was there for eternity. The "golden Horus name" may convey the same notion of eternity, expressing the wish that the king may be an eternal Horus.
d) The Prenomen
The Prenomen is the name that follows the title "King of Upper- and Lower-Egypt". The oldest known example of this title is again dated to the reign of 1st Dynasty king Den, when it was often combined with the Nebti-name, without a distinct name added to it. It would take until the end



101
of the 3rd Dynasty before this title really came into use. It would, eventually, replace the Horus-name as most important official royal name. The Prenomen itself almost always contained the name of the god Re. Typical examples are "pleasing to the heart of Re" (Amenemhat I) and "lord of the heavenly order is Re"
(Amenhotep III).
One of the first cases of Re as an element in a king’s name is
with Khephren of the 4th Dynasty (Khaf-Re). The title "King of Upper- and Lower-Egypt" can sometimes be followed by
the phrase "the Lord of the Two Lands", which sometimes even replaces it entirely. A queen can be called "the Mistress of the Two Lands".
e) The nomen
The nomen is introduced by the epithet "son of Ra". It was added to the royal titulary in the beginning of the 4th Dynasty. It was from that time on that the royal titulary
became established in the form discussed here.
The name following this title was, as a rule, the king’s name
of birth. It is almost the equivalent of our family name, for the 11th Dynasty affect the names Antef and Mentuhotep, the 12th Dynasty the names Amenemhat and Sesostris, the 13th Dynasty shows several kings of the name Sebekhotep and the 18th Dynasty consists almost entirely of ruler named Amenhotep or Thutmosis.
Sometimes, the phrase "the good god" is placed before the nomen of the king, in addition to or in place of the "son of



102
Re". Another title sometimes placed between "son of Re" and
the actual nomen was "lord of the apparitions", sometimes also translated as "lord of the crowns". This title
again confirms the narrow link between the king and the sun:
the king’s apparition on the throne is compared to the rising of
the sun on the Eastern horizon. From the latter half of the Old Kingdom onwards, the principal name is the Prenomen, and this is often found alone or accompanied only by the nomen. The Horus-name would serve only rarely for identification purposes. Both Prenomen and nomen are almost invariably written within "cartouches" or "royal rings". The cartouche depicts a loop formed by a rope, the ends tied together so as to offer to
the spectator the appearance of a straight line . Strictly speaking this loop should be round as it conveys the notions of "eternity" and "encompassing the entire creation". It is elongated and oval because of the length of the hieroglyphic names enclosed in it. Occasionally, one may find the name of a god or goddess in a cartouche. This was especially the case for Osiris-Onnophris and Isis in the temple inscriptions of the Greek-Roman Period. Cartouches were often followed by either a wish-formula such
as "living eternally" or "bestowed with eternal life", or by a phrase which relates the king to a
particular deity, for instance "beloved by Amun



103
Re". Note the honorific transposition whereby the name of
Amun-Re was moved to the start of the phrase.”69
The title ‘son of God’ or, in the case of those at the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty, ‘son of God the Father’ was considered
normal when attributed to the Egyptian pharaoh. It was part and parcel of his entitlement to the royal throne and his claim to the titles that the position held. More importantly, the pharaoh was considered to be divine – the incarnation of God on earth. As he believed that he had a genuine connection back to
Osiris, the incumbent might well have believed the he was a
God and may well have referred to Osiris as ‘the father’.
Given this Egyptian tradition, if it could be shown that the
person who became known as ‘Jesus Christ’ was in fact the
son of a pharaoh, with legitimate claim to the Egyptian throne,
then the title ‘Son of Ra’ and the other attributes would
equally have belonged to him. It sounds far-fetched, but for our investigation to be thorough we are obliged to examine this idea as a genuine possibility.

Chapter 6
The last known ‘Son of God’
If the hypothesis that the Jesus Christ person was to be a legitimate claimant to the Egyptian throne, then his father must have been someone with a rightful claim to the position
of Pharaoh and he must have been alive at the time of Jesus
Christ’s conception.
In fact, there are only two personalities that may accurately fit these limiting criteria; Ptolemy XIII the son of Ptolemy XIII Auletes or Ptolemy XIV, the younger brother of Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIII. Both of these persons held the Egyptian throne for a short time in the final century BCE and disappeared from office in mysterious circumstances.
Ptolemy XIV
Ptolemy XIV lived from 60 to 44 BCE and reigned 47 to 44 BCE. He was the brother of Cleopatra and son of Ptolemy XII one of the last members of the Ptolemaic Dynasty of Egypt. Following the death/disappearance of his older brother Ptolemy XIII in January 47 BCE, he was proclaimed Pharaoh and co-ruler by his older sister and remaining Pharaoh, Cleopatra VII. He and Cleopatra were married, but Cleopatra continued to be the lover of Julius Caesar. Ptolemy is considered to have reigned in name only, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority to herself.
Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator
Ptolemy XIII was 12 years old when he became joint ruler of Egypt (with his sister Cleopatra) in 51 BCE. Because of his



105
youth, Pothinus, alongside the general Achillas and the rhetorician Theodotus of Chios acted as co-rulers of Egypt, with the Roman Republic as their guardians. When Ptolemy and Cleopatra were elevated to the status of senior rulers, Pothinus was maintained as the former's regent. Most Egyptologists believed that Pothinus used his influence to turn Ptolemy against Cleopatra. In the spring of 48 BCE, Ptolemy XIII and Pothinus attempted to depose Cleopatra VII who had made moves to enhance her status as Queen. Her face appeared on minted coins, for example, while Ptolemy XIII's name was omitted on official documents. It is likely that Ptolemy intended to become sole ruler, with Pothinus acting as the power behind the throne. Ptolemy and Pothinus managed to force Cleopatra to flee to Syria. However, she soon organized her own army and when she returned to claim her throne, a civil war began in Egypt. At this time their other sister made her claim the throne as Arsinoe IV. This complicated the situation but without direct Roman support, her influence was short lived. Defeated Roman general Pompey the Great came to Egypt to seek refuge from his pursuing rival, Julius Caesar. Initially, Ptolemy XIII and Pothinus pretended to accept his request, but on September 29, 48 BC, Pothinus had the General murdered, in hopes of winning favour with Caesar. When Caesar arrived he was presented with the head of his deceased rival and former ally, but reportedly, instead of being pleased, he reacted with disgust and ordered that Pompey's body be located and that he be given a proper Roman funeral. Cleopatra VII proved more successful in winning Caesar's favour and became his lover. Caesar arranged the execution of



106
Pothinus and the official return to the throne of Cleopatra VII, who never officially annulled her marriage to Ptolemy XIII. Still determined to depose Cleopatra, Ptolemy XIII allied himself with his sister Arsinoe IV. Jointly, they organized the factions of the army loyal to them against those loyal to Cleopatra VII and the relatively small part of his army that had accompanied Caesar to Egypt. The battle between the warring factions occurred in December of 48 BCE inside Alexandria itself. The city suffered serious damage, including (according to some sources) the burning of some of the buildings which comprised the Library of Alexandria. The arrival of Roman reinforcements from Pergamum gave the victory to Caesar and Cleopatra VII, forcing Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV to flee the city. Ptolemy XIII reportedly drowned in January, 47 BC while attempting to cross the Nile. It is claimed that he was weighed down by a golden suit of armour. Strangely however, no body was found. Cleopatra VII remained the unchallenged ruler of Egypt, although she named their younger brother Ptolemy IV (47–44 BC) her new co-ruler.
It was later that the first clue was received that Ptolemy XIII might not in fact be dead;
“In Ephesus, Cleopatra’s sister, Arsinoe, spared
by Caesar after his Alexandrian triumph and transferred to benign imprisonment amongst the priests of Artemis, had suddenly declared herself Queen of Egypt. There were accompanying rumours that their one surviving brother, and her own official husband, Ptolemy XIV, was



107
Arsinoe’s accomplice. There was even the
rumour of a pretender claiming to be her dead brother, Ptolemy XIII, the one whose golden
armour had been dredged from the blooded
waters of the Nile.”70
“Upon return to Egypt, Cleopatra found herself
and her son in a vulnerable position. By then, Ptolemy XIV would have been about fifteen, old enough to demand equal power and old enough to become a rival. Meanwhile, her sister Arsinoe was up to her usual tricks, working behind the
scenes to sow dissent and confusion. In
Cleopatra’s absence, Arsinoe had tried to pass off
an imposter as Ptolemy XIII, alive and well and claiming his place on the throne.”71
On March 15, 44 BCE Caesar was murdered in Rome. Ptolemy XIV disappeared a few months later and it has been assumed but remains uncertain that Cleopatra poisoned her co-ruler to replace him with his nephew Ptolemy XV Caesarion, the infant son of Cleopatra and Caesar, who was proclaimed co-ruler in September 44 BCE. In 41 BCE, Mark Antony, one of the triumvirate who ruled Rome in the power vacuum following Caesar's death, sent his intimate friend Quintus Dellius to Egypt to summon Cleopatra to Tarsus to meet him. Cleopatra arrived in great state, and so charmed Antony that he chose to spend the winter of 41

108
BCE–40 BCE with her in Alexandria. To safeguard herself and Caesarion, she had Antony order the death of her sister Arsinoe and asked him to remove the threat presented by a young man, who was claiming to be Ptolemy XIII her brother. The execution of Arsinoe was carried out in 41 BCE on the steps of the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Historians tell us;
“Mark Antony and Cleopatra were forging an
alliance of their own. Cleopatra agreed to make her wealth and resources available to Mark Antony in his bid to overtake Pathia. In return he arranged to have Arsinoe
assassinated. For good measure he also
arranged to have Ptolemy XIII’s imposter tracked down and assassinated also.”72
“Cleopatra advised Mark Antony that it was
in fact her sister Arsinoe who encouraged Serapion to give the Egyptian fleet to Cassius and Brutus (this may well be true) which
made it an easy matter for Cleopatra to
persuade Mark Antony to order Arsinoe’s
execution. Unfortunately, Arsinoe was killed on the steps of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus causing further scandal in Rome. Cleopatra begged clemency for the priests of Artemis who were the guardians of Arsinoe, but extended no such request for Serapion or
72 Ibid



109
for the young pretender who claimed to be
Ptolemy XIII, raised from the dead”73
“And then Antony began doing the things she
asked. It was, in the first instance, to have a number of people killed, killed or delivered up to her — her sister Arsinoe, who, since she had been led a captive through the streets of Rome, had taken refuge in the precinct of Artemis at Ephesus, where she was now murdered to gratify Cleopatra's undying hatred; a young man at Aradus, (a small island of the coast of what is now Lebanon) who professed to be her vanished brother Ptolemy XII; Serapion, the Ptolemaic
governor of Cyprus, who had given help to
Cassius.” 74
“Although Cleopatra asked for clemency for
the temple clergy who had hailed Arsinoe queen, Antonius also ordered the execution of
Serapion and a young pretender claiming to
be the resurrected Ptolemy XIII”75 “.... and a man calling himself Ptolemy XIII
had appeared, miraculously delivered from the
watery grave in the Nile delta marshes.”76

110
The above quotations claim that Antony ordered that the young pretender be killed. As this young man had spent time with Arsinoe, the wife and sister of Ptolemy, it is unlikely that she did not recognise him and therefore he was most likely to have in fact been the young king. Additionally, if Cleopatra believed him to be dead, she would hardly have imposed upon Mark Antony to have him killed. In other words, the likelihood is that Ptolemy XIII was alive. More than that, he was obviously motivated to stay alive. This was a young man who had previously proved himself an expert in self protection and in the use of disguise and deceit
to elude death. Because of that it cannot be assumed that
Mark Antony’s orders produced their desired result.
There has never been a claim that Ptolemy eluded capture and escaped. However, until he surfaced in Ephesus and then again in Aradus there had never been any claims that he escaped when he deceived the Romans into believing that he had
drowned in the Nile. In fact, despite the lack of a body, the
bulk of today’s historians still believe that he was killed when Caesar’s forces pursued him in 47 BCE. Another quotation
might unintentionally provide a clue to what happened;
“Yet another enemy was also killed at
Cleopatra’s request. This was a youth in the
Phoenician town of Aradus (Arvad) who claimed
to be Cleopatra’s half-brother and husband Ptolemy XIII. After the young king’s downing in
the Nile, in mysterious circumstances Caesar had been afraid that false reports of his survival would get about, and now this person at Aradus



111
had justified his fears by declaring that he
himself was the king. So he too was executed at
Antony’s instructions.
In these Syrian territories Antony found that his favour towards Cleopatra had lost him a great deal of support, for the Syrians never forgot that large areas of their country had once been occupied by the Ptolemaic kingdom, and that she was ambitious to re-annex them. Consequently, the seizure of Serapion at her request must have seemed high handed to his hosts at Tyre; and
there were people at Aradus who resented the
execution of the Pretender Ptolemy XIII.”77
Aradus was a small island 2km from the mainland and any visiting Roman soldiers would have been easy to see as their boats approached. When they did arrive, the soldiers would have found it necessary to have their target pointed out to them. If Ptolemy had friends on the island, there would have been enough time
to hide him and for locals to point out some foreigner who
wasn’t as popular as he. Once this other person had been killed
they would then have protested, in order to persuade Mark Antony and Cleopatra to believe that it was Ptolemy who had been killed. Ptolemy XIII was only 21 years old and would have possessed
the athleticism and agile mind of an adroit young man. If he
was still in Aradus when Mark Antony’s troop of killers
arrived and he did evade them, it would have been relatively
77 Cleopatra; Michael Grant



112
easy for him to disappear into Syria and from there he would have had the later opportunity to move south into Palestine.
The group of soldiers that were dispatched to murder Ptolemy were also despatched to eliminate Arsinoe, the sister of Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra, who had been granted sanctuary by Caesar at the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. Arsinoe lived in the temple for a few years, always keeping a distant but watchful eye on her sister Cleopatra, who perceived Arsinoe as a threat to her power. In 41 BCE, at Cleopatra's instigation,
Mark Antony ordered Arsinoe to be executed. She was
murdered by Mark Antony’s soldiers on the steps of the
temple, a gross violation of the temple sanctuary and an act which scandalised Rome. What is significant to our analysis is that the death of Arsinoe was widely reported but there was no report regarding the location of and killing of the pretender Ptolemy XIII.
The emotional games played between Cleopatra and Mark Antony are well documented as was her suicide in 30 BCE. Her son by Caesar, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar known as Caesarion was thirteen years old and was killed at the behest of Octavian in the same year. These deaths ended the official Egyptian monarchy and simultaneously it officially ended the Pharaonic bloodline. Cleopatra and Marc Antony did have a daughter; Cleopatra Selene. This daughter married Juba II son off King Juba I of Numidia and the couple had a son known as Ptolemy of Mauretania (9BCE – 40 CE). This person lived in Rome until he was 21 when he returned to Mauretania (part of Algeria). He was not of the authentic Royal bloodline and had no claim to the Pharaonic crown.



113
We have no tangible evidence that Ptolemy XIII survived. If he did survive, he would have lived in hiding, aware that knowledge of him being alive would invite pursuit and assassination. He would most likely have adopted a humble disguise, since anything more would have attracted attention. What we do know is that there is a possibility that he did
survive and that the co-incidental emergence of a humble
unknown who came to be attributed with the title ‘Son of God’
points to the fact that he did. At the same time, he would have been aware of the succession difficulties experienced by his father Ptolemy XII and his grandfather Ptolemy XI and the emphasis they had placed on Pharaonic succession:
In 80 BC, Ptolemy XI had been removed from the throne of Egypt after he had killed his coregent and step mother Berenice III. When he later died without a male heir, the only available male descendents of the Ptolemaic lineage were the illegitimate sons of Ptolemy IX by an unknown Greek concubine. The boys were living in exile in Sinope, at the court of Mithridates VI, King of Pontus. The eldest of the boys, Ptolemy XII was proclaimed king with the title Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos and he married his sister, Tryphaena. He was coregent with his daughter Cleopatra VI Tryphaena and his wife Cleopatra V Tryphaena. The stumbling block was that Ptolemy XI had left the throne to Rome in his will therefore Ptolemy XII was not the legitimate successor. To secure his fate and the fate of his dynasty Ptolemy XII adopted a pro-Roman policy. Nevertheless, a patron relationship with Pompey in Rome did not guarantee his permanence on the throne, thus Ptolemy XII soon afterwards



114
travelled to Rome to offer a bribe in exchange for an official recognition of his kingship. When he was threatened by an uprising Ptolemy XII fled again to Rome, possibly with his daughter Cleopatra VII, in search of safety. His daughter Berenice IV became his successor and ruled as coregent with her sister (or possibly mother) Cleopatra VI. A year after Ptolemy XII's exile, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena died and Berenice ruled alone over Alexandria from 57 to 56 BCE. Ptolemy XII finally recovered his throne by paying Aulus Gabinius 10,000 talents to invade Egypt in 55 BCE. He had Berenice and her supporters executed. From then on, he reigned until he fell ill in 51 BC. Around two thousand Roman soldiers and mercenaries, the so-called Gabiniani, were stationed in Alexandria to ensure Ptolemy XII's authority on the throne. In exchange, Rome was able to exert its power over the restored king. Before his death, Ptolemy XII chose his daughter Cleopatra VII as his coregent. In his will, he declared that she and her brother Ptolemy XIII should rule the kingdom together. To safeguard his interests, he made the people of Rome executors of his will. Since the Senate was busy with its own affairs, Pompey (as Ptolemy XII's ally) approved the will.
“Throughout his long-lasting reign the principal aim of Ptolemy was to secure his hold on the Egyptian throne so as to eventually pass it to his heirs. To achieve this goal he was prepared to sacrifice much: the loss of rich Ptolemaic lands, most of his wealth and even, according to Cicero, the very dignity on which the mystique of



115
kingship rested when he appeared before the
Roman people as a mere supplicant.”78
This tells us that Ptolemy XIII would probably have been indoctrinated with the importance of the Pharaonic line. The
importance of the Pharaonic bloodline had been established by
Ptolemy 1 through his sponsorship of Manetho’s’ Aegyptika.
This, and the drama of his own scenario, would have ensured that Ptolemy XIII was aware that he was the last Pharaoh, the last God King and that to perpetuate the link to Osiris he would need to produce a boy child. As with all legitimate
pharaohs, such a child, like all its predecessors would then
have claim to the Pharaonic title and to the title ‘Son of God’.

Chapter 7
The selection of the ‘Mother of the Son of God’
Ptolemy XIII would have been 21 years old when Arsinoe was killed. Given that he was a young man, he had plenty of time to arrange habitation and to contrive and organise the continuation of the Pharaonic dynasties by siring a son who would inherit the blood line. The nativity of Jesus Christ is generally believed to have occurred circa 6 BCE, when Ptolemy XIII, if alive, would have been some 56 years old.
In a previous chapter we discussed the fact that the eighteenth dynasty was the last group of kings that could claim to be able
to trace their genealogy (sometimes via the female line) back
to Osiris without a non-reconcilable break. The ‘spin’ that had
been orchestrated by Ramesses, Alexander and Ptolomy 1 to hide their illegitimate claim to the kingship was probably known by all subsequent kings and it had most likely been discussed among their close advisors. In particular the priests of Egypt whose raison d’être was to perpetuate the essence of the old religion would have contrived to advise on measures to keep the line intact. Given that Ptolemy I was the sponsor of Manetho, it is most likely that any breaks in the bloodline would have been known to all the Pharaohs of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Anyone fixed on the idea of perpetuating the line, might well have wished to correct any anomalies and because of that the choice of the mother for the next in line would have been very significant.



117
In all likelihood Ptolemy XIII had gone into hiding in Syria, a country that, like Palestine had existed under Egyptian influence for many centuries;
“The Egyptian religion crossed the Jewish
boundaries of Palestine and Syria as early as 1479 BCE when Thutmose III invaded the
threatening Kadash coalition at Yehem and
Meggido.”79
“Then, in 301 BCE at the battle of Ipsus,
Antigonus was killed, and the three allies were finally able to divide up the empire between them. Not only did Ptolemy I become supreme ruler of Egypt, but also added Palestine and
lower Syria to his empire. Under his rule, all of
these territories appear to have prospered.”80
Ptolemy XIII would most likely have had access to priests who would be disposed towards him and who would revere him as a God King. He would have been able to use his access to such loyal priests to take refuge where necessary and to get information where he required it. For all these reasons it would seem logical that Ptolemy XIII might use the time he had to search out a woman who had inherited Royal Blood. To

118
do that, he would have needed to use his influence with priests to find a female whose royal ancestry could be traced back to the eighteenth dynasty. In retrospect, we are helped in our understanding of this because Jesus, genealogy is found at two places in the Bible:
1. Matthew's gospel (Mat 1:2-16). Starts with Abraham and lists his descendants all the way down to Jesus. There are 41 generations in total.
2. Luke's gospel (Luke 3:23-38). This genealogy starts with Jesus and follows his line up until God. There are 77 generations mentioned in total.
In each of the two genealogies, every name is different until we reach David, with the exception of Joseph, Zorobabel and Salathiel. Because of this, it is almost impossible to reconcile them by matching the persons and claim that they are listed by different names (as we've seen many times before in the Bible). The fact that there are two different lists suggests that the two genealogies do not trace the same lineage. It is easy therefore, to come to the conclusion that one of the two genealogies in the gospels must list Jesus' ancestors through his father, while the other must list them through his mother. The preceding verse in Luke tells us that that line from Joseph started with Heli;
Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli;81
81 Luke 3 23



119
Despite the differences, the place where these two lists coincide is with David and it is probably significant that,
amongst other titles attributed to him, Jesus was known as
‘Son of David’.
David has always been thought to have been significant by
those tracing the genealogy of Jesus Christ and for that reason
King David’s place in history warrants closer analysis.
It is significant that on the basis of what we already know about the authenticity of the 18th dynasty, several researchers and Egyptologists have claimed that David was the Egyptian Pharaoh, Thutmose III; an important Pharaoh from this same dynasty;
“The first segment of Pharaoh Thutmose III’s
epithet was always written as "Twt", i.e. with 3 consonants. For some mischievous reasons the middle consonant letter was changed to the vowel "u" by some Egyptologists. When "Twt" was written, in the equivalent Hebrew alphabetical characters, it becomes "Dwd". When "Dwd" is pronounced phonetically it becomes "Dawood" which the Hebrew name for "DAVID"82
“The accounts in the Bible of David and his wars
and military battles described in the Tanakh (the Jewish Bible) compare with and are similar to the
82 Historical deception; The Untold Story of Ancient Egypt; Moustaffa Gadalla



120
exploits of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose
III as they were written on the stone walls on the
Temple of Karnak in Thebes”83
“It was the Egyptian King David (Thutmose III)
who had defeated an earlier coalition of Syrian and Canaanite kings, and as described in the Bible, had established garrisons in these regions
in order to permanently secure Egyptian control
there.” (2 Samuel 8:5,6)84
There is little evidence of the process of selection that
culminated in Mary. The only story that we can reference was
‘The Book of James – Protevangelium’.85 This was an
apocryphal Gospel, probably written about 150 CE. It is the oldest source to assert the virginity of Mary not only prior to but during (and after) the birth of Jesus and was quoted by Origin in the early third century. Origin was an early Christian bishop, based in Alexandria whose writings show him to have had an affinity for ancient Egyptian beliefs.86 The Book of James tells us;
“X;1 Now there was a council of the priests, and they said: Let us make a veil for the temple of the Lord. And the priest said: Call unto me pure virgins of the tribe of David. And the officers

121
departed and sought and found seven virgins. And the priests called to mind the child Mary that she was of the tribe of David and was undefiled before God: and the officers went and fetched her. And they brought them into the temple of the Lord, and the priest said: Cast me lots, which of you shalt weave the gold and the undefiled (the white) and tile fine linen and the silk and the hyacinthine, and the scarlet and the true purple. And the lot of the true purple and the scarlet fell unto Mary, and she took them and went unto her house. And at that season Zacharias became dumb, and Samuel was in his stead until the time when Zacharias spake again. But Mary took the scarlet and began to spin it. XL 1 And she took the pitcher and went forth to fill it with water: and lo a voice saying: Hail, thou that art highly favoured; the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And she looked about her upon the right hand and upon the left, to see whence this voice should be: and being filled with trembling she~ went to her house and set down the pitcher, and took the purple and sat down upon her seat and drew out the thread. 2 And behold an angel/messenger of the Lord stood before her saying: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace before the Lord of all things, and thou shalt conceive of his word. And she, when she heard it, questioned in herself, saying: Shall I verily conceive of the living God, and



122
bring forth after the manner of all women? And the angel/messenger of the Lord said: Not so, Mary, for a power of the Lord shall overshadow thee: wherefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of the Highest. And thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. And
Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord is
before him: be it unto me according to thy word.”
If this document is valid and truthful, it indicates that the
priests were looking for ‘virgins of the tribe David’ and that her introduction to the Lord’s emissary was not a random co
incidence. In particular it tells us and that it was not done at
the behest of some heavenly inspiration. Interestingly, The
James Bible gives the name of Mary’s father as Ioacim which
would point to the genealogy in Matthew as that of Mary. This
means that Mary’s genealogy was traced by Matthew
What is obvious therefore is that if David was Thutmose III and Ptolemy XIII selected someone who he knew to have a direct line from King David, he was selecting someone of the Royal Blood. He was choosing a woman who would assist him to re-establish the authentic Pharaonic line back to Osiris.
The New Testament was written by people with an agenda. They were believers who were disposed towards a
supernatural, incarnate God and to his earthly manifestation in
the form of his ‘Son’, Jesus Christ. For this reason, the
gospels must be read with some scepticism as they may not represent an actual description of what took place. Taking that into account, it would perhaps be worthwhile to look at the



123
Gospels to see if we can find links to Ptolomy XIII, the last Egyptian God King. The Gospels were written in ancient Greek and each Greek word had many possible ways of being translated into English. The first verse relating to the annunciation as described by Luke in Greek reads;
Ἐν δὲ τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ ἀπεστάλη ὁ ἄγγελος Γαβ ριὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ εἰς πόλιν τῆςΓαλιλαίας ἧ ὄνομ α Ναζαρὲθ.
The normal English translation of this and the ensuing verses is;
"26The angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the House of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 28 And he went in and said to her; 'Rejoice, so highly favoured! The Lord is with you.' "29 But she was deeply disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting could mean, 30 and the angel said to her; 'Mary, do not be afraid; you have won God's favour. 31 And behold! You are to conceive and bear a Son, and you must name him Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David; 33 and he will rule over the House of Jacob forever and his reign will have no end.' "34 And Mary said to the angel; 'How can this come about, since I am a virgin?'



124
"'35 The Holy Spirit will come upon you,' the angel answered, 'and the power of the Most High will cover you with its shadow. And so the child will be holy and will be called Son of God. 36 And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth has, in her old age, herself conceived a son, and she whom people called barren is now in her sixth month, 37 for nothing is impossible to God.' 38 'I am the handmaid of the Lord,' said Mary; 'Let what you have said be done to me.' And the angel left her."87
This translation leaves out the first few words of verse one;
‘In but the sixth month...’ These words do not seem to add
much to the story until we compute the date claimed for
Christ’s birth;
“The earliest source stating December 25 as the
date of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170–236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring Equinox which he
placed on March 25, and then added nine
months.”88
This would have been true if we start at the sixth month of the Hebrew (lunar) calendar of the time, which has the first month of the year as Tishrei (September-October). In fact, Hippolytus
87 Luke 1; 26-38 88 Mercer dictionary of the Bible; Mills, McKnight, Bullard



125
devised his own calendar to fit the facts that he wished to present;
“Anti-pope Hippolytus replaced the 8-year Octaeteris lunar cycle, used by the early bishops and priests of Rome for circa 174 years, with his own ill-conceived 16-year cycle.”89
Another element of Luke’s account of the annunciation worthy of comment is the use of the name ‘Gabriel’. The Hebrew etymology of this name tells us that the word meant; ‘God’s man’ or ‘God’s strong man’. This definition conjures a picture
of a very different individual than some mystical winged being
from the heavens, when the god in question is an earthly
Egyptian King, who is likely to have had a retinue of ‘men’ to
protect and serve him. This same twist of perspective can be used looking at the end
of verse 33. The actual translation from the Greek reads; ‘And
this royal power itself not will be the last/the end/an end’. This
seems to be a logical statement, when interpreted in the context of someone wishing to perpetuate the Egyptian royal
bloodline.
Whatever one’s disposition or faith, there is no doubt that the person of Mary was chosen to give birth to the ‘Son of God’.
She was of the house of David, and this could only have been significant in the context of her ancestry. This in turn becomes logical (in the hypothesis we are presenting) and fits the circumstances if David was the eighteenth dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III - the last known dynasty with authentic links to

126
the primary bloodline. In this reality Ptolemy XIII believed that by marrying Mary, he would be able to beget a child that
would provide an interrupted link in the Royal bloodline back
to Osiris. Whilst he personally was the ‘Son of God’ in name, his son would be ‘Son of God’ in reality.



127
Chapter 8 Fulfilment of prophecy?
Orthodox Christians will claim that the arrival of Jesus was the
fulfilment of Old Testament prophecies, in Genesis, Samuel,
Isaiah and Micah. The Genesis prophecy relates to the Lord’s
instruction to Abraham;
“Get out of your country, from your family and
from your father's house, to a land that I will show you. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you; and in
you all the families of the earth shall be
blessed.”90
This quotation (together with the final verses of Genesis
Chapter 11) make it clear that the ‘home’ of Abraham was
Haran (in modern Syria) and that Haran was also the name of
Abraham’s brother. When he and his family leave they
journey through Israel, but because of famine they continued on into Egypt. This recorded instruction was followed by Abraham’s expedition which took him to Egypt. There he tricked the
Pharaoh into marrying Sarah his wife, leading to conjecture
about who was the father of Sarah’s son Isaac and because of
90 Genesis 12; 1-3



128
that, the interrelationship between the Abrahamic and
Egyptian blood lines.
It is difficult to know whether Sarah’s relationship with the
un-named pharaoh was with a king from the 13th dynasty or of a Semitic King from the concurrent 14th dynasty. Neither is it clear whether the land Abraham was told to exit was in Egypt
or in one of the Canaan territories. Similarly, whilst it is
assumed that the ‘great nation’ was referring to a nation based
in Israel, it could equally be referring to one based in Egypt. In this context, the link to the Egyptian bloodline may well have been established between 1800 BCE (when it is most likely that Abraham was born) and the eighteenth dynasty which commenced in 1550 BCE during which time there was considerable overlapping of the so-called dynasties as is shown in the table below.
The 14th Dynasty consisted of a local group from the eastern Delta, based at Avaris that ruled from 1805 BCE until around 1650 BCE. The dynasty comprised many rulers with West Semitic names and is thus believed to have been Canaanite or Hebrew in origin. The 15th dynasty was also Semitic and the people were called Hyksos. The 16th dynasty was a Theban dynasty which grew out of the collapse of the 13th Dynasty. T he 17th Dynasty covers a period of time when Egypt was split into a set of small Hyksos kingdoms. It consisted mainly of Theban rulers and was contemporary with the 15th and 16th dynasties.



129
The end of the 17th dynasty ran directly into the 18th, which controlled the whole of Egypt and which is generally acknowledged to be the legitimate line.

Another Old Testament reference is one which states that God sent Nathan the prophet to David and to tell him;
“When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he shall be My son”91
This verse in Samuel was written some 800 years after the event. Because of that we must assume that it is derived from a verbal tradition, with all the inherent defects that such a tradition holds. According to Jewish belief the book was written by Samuel, with additions by the prophets Gad and Nathan. Modern scholarly thinking is that the entire history (called the Deuteronomistic history) was composed in the period 630–540 BCE by combining a number of independent texts and traditions of various ages. Josiah became king of Judah circa 641/640 BCE. To the east, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate, the Babylonian Empire had not yet replaced it, and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In this power vacuum, Judah was able to govern itself for the time being without foreign intervention. However, in the spring of 609 BCE, Pharaoh Necho II personally led a sizable army up to the Euphrates to aid the Assyrians. The Kingdom of Judah came to an end in 586 BCE when Babylonian forces
91 2 Samuel 7; 12-14



131
under Nebuchadnezzar II captured Jerusalem, and removed
most of its population and took them back to their own lands.
Babylonian rule was toppled however in the 540’s, by Cyrus,
who founded the Persian Empire in its place.
Given that the ‘prophecy’ would take into account the existing
power bases at his time of writing, it must therefore have been written circa 640 BCE and referred to Israel, or it was written circa 605 BCE and the land referred to was Egypt. Necho the king of Egypt is quoted as saying;
"What quarrel is there between you and me, O king of Judah? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."92
In this quotation we can see that the pharaoh Necho II claims that he has direct instruction from God, which if true means he will have received instruction via the Oracle. Consulting the Oracle was a ritual involving priests and priestesses in the place of the Oracle who interpreted the word of God for the supplicant.
In addition to the question about the source of the instruction,
it is difficult to know whether the ‘God’ referred to is Osiris or Ra, communicated with via the Oracle or whether the ‘God’
concerned was the divine King of Egypt and the words spoken
were phrased similarly to those of a modern monarch who
says; ‘we disapprove’ (for example) when they mean ‘I disapprove’.
92 2 Chronicles 35; 21



132
These simple analyses put down serious question marks over any claims to authenticity of prophecies, which in most cases are based on events that have already taken place or are seen to be underway. Where they do predict the future they are based on wishful thinking by priests who would always have wished to please their petitioners. Another prophet whose works are worthy of examination is Isaiah. It is generally thought that his ministry as a prophet began circa 739 BCE. According to Jewish tradition, Isaiah was executed by Manasseh only a few years after he ascended the throne. This would imply that Isaiah prophesied during a period of approximately fifty years circa 739 - 690 BCE. This is the period when Persians, Assyrians/Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks were competing for power and during which Judea was overrun and controlled by each of these power bases in turn. In this context it is easy to see that the bulk of the Isaiah texts were written to bolster the self belief of the people of Judea and to deprecate the other nations.
Isaiah was called the Messianic prophet based on his
prophecies in Isaiah 52 and 53, which indicate that a ‘servant of God’ will undergo suffering. Specifically verses 52; 14-15
tell us;
“Behold, my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted. As many were astonished at you — his appearance was so
marred, beyond human semblance, and his form
beyond that of the children of mankind”
As the person is not identified other than as ‘my servant’ and
much of it is in the past tense, one might be forgiven for



133
assuming that the content of these versus refers to Osiris, the mutilated God King of the Egyptians. The current Jewish tradition does not believe that the Isaiah predictions were fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ. The Isaiah prophecy which is claimed to relate to Mary and the virgin birth of Jesus tells us;
“Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:
The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son,
and will call him Immanuel (God is with us)”93
All the great nations of Mesopotamia surrounding Judea on every side had a comprehensive pantheon of religious beliefs combined with long traditions. Many of these included stories
of a special individual who was closely associated with God
(if not a god himself) and who emanated from a ‘virgin birth.’
 Mithras had existed as the savior-god of Persia for 4000 years. He had been born on December 25th of a virgin, was laid in the crib and was visited by three wise men who brought him gold, frankincense and myrrh.
 Zoroaster the Persian God was conceived by a shaft of light circa 1200 BCE and the reports of his life have many similarities to that of Jesus as recorded in the gospels.
93 Isaiah 7; 14



134
 In the Assyrian/Babylonian tradition, Marduk, who was the head of the Babylonian pantheon since the
second half of the 2nd millennium BCE was created
‘in the heart of Apsu’, while; ‘He who begot him was
Ea, his father, she who conceived him was Damkina, his mother’. In same Assyrian traditions the king Tukulti-Urta (circa 800 BCE) was created by the gods in the womb of his mother.
 The Greek Gods Dionysus, Adonis, Attis was born on December 25th of a virgin or by intervention of Zeus and Dionysus was placed in a crib among beasts.
 Horus can be traced to the beginning of Egyptian history, as son of the goddess Isis and the God Osiris. His conception and birth were contrived without intercourse and are to be understood in terms of the Egyptian doctrine of parthenogenesis, which is an asexual form of reproduction found in females where growth and development of embryos or seeds occur without fertilization by a male.
Living god-kings, sons of God and gods who are the rebirth of
the God in Heaven were the order of the day. Conversations
with gods and prophecies using ‘the Oracle’ were the norm. In
fact, the book of Isaiah uses the word Oracle in preference to the word prophecy. In the context of the traditions of the Gods of Persia, Assyria, Greece and Egypt, an attempt to portray a future for Judea, which is a powerful for the Hebrews and as full and



135
symbolism as that of its enemies is understandable. In any event, the fact that events are predicted and then, some 800
years later someone claims that they have been fulfilled does
not mean that the ‘prophet’ actually foresaw the event, neither
does it mean that the event actually happened. Accordingly, the fact that there were prophecies and claims that they were fulfilled in the person of Jesus does not offer any tangible
confirmation that our hypothesis is invalid. If it sows doubts,
then they must be offset by looking deeper into Jesus’ known
connections with Egypt, in order to locate counterbalancing evidence.



136
Chapter 9
Jesus’ connections with Egypt
The first place in the New Testament Gospels that mentions a
connection between Jesus and Egypt is Matthew’s second chapter reference to the ‘slaughter of the innocents’ and the ‘Holy family’s Flight into Egypt’ to protect their newborn son.
There, it tells us that Jesus was born when Herod the Great (74 – 4 BCE) was King of the Jews as well as a client (puppet monarch) of the Roman emperor.
Herod rebuilt/upgraded the Temple in Jerusalem, but he is
chiefly remembered amongst Christians as the instigator of the
‘Massacre of the Innocents’.
The gospels tell us that three wise men from the East informed
Herod of the birth of a ‘king’ in Bethlehem. In response to their failure to reappear and report the child’s whereabouts
Herod "sent forth and put to death all the male children in that town and in all its districts, from two years old and under" (Matt. 2:16). The story continues and it explains that the Holy Family was
able to avoid this massacre by fleeing to Egypt, where they
remained until an ‘angel’ told Joseph that Herod had died. ‘The massacre of the innocents’ is not reported outside of the
Gospel of Matthew and other later Christian writings, which are based on that gospel. The Roman Jewish historian, Josephus, does not mention it in his history, Antiquities of the Jews (c. 94 CE).



137
The first twenty verses of Chapter 2 of Matthew’s gospel can
be divided into two parts, 1-12 concerning the Magi and birth
and 13-21 concerning the ‘Flight into Egypt’;
“1In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East
came to Jerusalem, 2asking, “Where is the child
who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.” 3When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; 4and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. 5They told him, “In
Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by
the prophet: 6‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of
Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of
Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to
shepherd my people Israel.’” 7Then Herod
secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had
appeared. 8Then he sent them to Bethlehem,
saying, “Go and search diligently for the child;
and when you have found him, bring me word so
that I may also go and pay him homage.”
9When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. 10When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. 11On entering the house, they saw the child



138
with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 12And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road. 13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him." 14 And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, 15 and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt have I called my son." 16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all of that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men. 17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: 18 "A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they were no more." 19 But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, 20 "Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are



139
dead." 21 And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. “94
There is a debate about whether the massacre of the Innocents actually took place. The main arguments against the validity of verses 13-21 include;
1. Of the four Gospels, only Matthew mentions these events
2. It is not mentioned in either Roman or Jewish records, when it is known that historians such as Josephus carefully recorded Herod's abuses.
3. Eminent scholars such as Geza Vermes and E P
Sanders regard it as a ’creative hagiography’95
4. It is a story contrived to fulfil prophecy. Various students of the bible tell us;
“This is a pure invention on Matthew's part.
Herod was guilty of many monstrous crimes, including the murder of several members of his own family. However, ancient historians such as Josephus, who delighted in listing Herod's crimes, do not mention what would have been Herod's greatest crime by far. It simply didn't happen. The context of Jeremiah 31:15 makes it
94 Matthew 2:13-21 95 The Nativity and Legend; Geza Vermes



140
clear that the weeping is for the Israelites about to be taken into exile in Babylon, and has nothing to
do with slaughtered children hundreds of years
later.”96
“Matthew's purpose is to present Jesus as the Messiah, and the Massacre of the Innocents as the fulfilment of passages in Hosea (One of the twelve prophets of the Hebrew Bible) referring to
the exodus, and in Jeremiah referring to the
Babylonian exile”97
This prophecy of Micah was used in Matthew to claim that the birth of Jesus fulfilled prophecy;
"But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity."
This is questionable on two counts; (a) The Bethlehem
referred to by Micah may well be the name of a person
not a place. (b) It talks of someone who is to be the ‘ruler in Israel’, which Jesus never was.
5 Bethlehem was a small village with an estimated population of 1000 people. Based on this population size,

141
the maximum number of children under two years old would have been twenty.
We do not know whether the story of the ‘Slaughter of the innocents’ and of the ‘Flight into Egypt’ is true. Whether
true or not, there are elements in these stories that bear examination:
A. The contradictions created by the differences in the stories of Matthew and Luke.
B. Why Matthew told the story of the Magi?
C. Why Herod became so upset about stories of a king being born in a Bethlehem?
D. Why the Holy Family were directed to go to Egypt? Or, if the story is untrue; why Matthew chose Egypt as his reported destination?
Looking at each of these in turn;
A. The contradictions between Luke and Matthew;
According to Matthew, Jesus was born during the reign of Herod the Great. According to Luke, Jesus was born during the first census in Israel, while Quirinius was governor of Syria.98 This is impossible because Herod died in March of 4 BC and the census
98 Luke 2;2



142
took place in 6 and 7 AD, about 10 years after Herod's death. In order to have Jesus born in Bethlehem, Luke says that everyone had to go to the city of their birth to register for the census. This is again highly unlikely since it would have caused a bureaucratic nightmare. The purpose of the Roman census was taxation and the Romans were interested in where the people lived and worked, not where they were born. Both Matthew and Luke say that Jesus was born in Bethlehem and Matthew misquotes Micah 5:2 to show that this was in fulfilment of prophecy. Luke has Mary and Joseph travelling from their home in Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem in Judea for the birth of Jesus99 while Matthew, says that it was only after the birth of Jesus that Mary and Joseph resided in Nazareth, and then only because they were afraid to return to Judea.
This divergence of these reports puts doubt on many
that the gospel’s claims concerning the events of the
Nativity. What they do show however, is that the gospel writers believed it important to claim that the birth took place in Bethlehem and that it was important to reference it to a census.
B. Why did Matthew tell the story of the Magi?
Without the divine intervention promoted by
Christians, how could ‘wise men from the East’ have
99 Luke 2;4



143
known of the Childs birth and what is the reference to
a star?
The only way that the ‘wise men’ would have known
of the impending birth is if they had been told about it. It is not difficult to imagine that Ptolemy XIII might have told priests with whom he had sought refuge about the impending birth that would secure the Pharaonic blood line. Additionally, at a time when particular days of the year were known and predicted by the rising and setting of individual stars, (sometimes planets such as Venus that were thought to be stars) it is not difficult to imagine that the date of the birth of the child would be predictable (nine months after conception) in relation to the rising of a certain star. This is in line with the Egyptian tradition, maintained by the priests, of tracking the stars and
predicting the Egyptian calendar by their rise and fall.
It also ties in with the idea that the term ‘Magi’ was
itself related to astrology and the positions of the stars in the Heavens;
"The teachings of Zarathushtra were intermingled with the old religion, and the Magi's position was transformed into the priests of the new religion..." writes Dariush Jahanian. Many of the Magian practices were themselves adapted from Mesopotamian religion, such as purity laws and especially astrology. This is how the Magi came to be known in the West as astrologers. The word for "magic," as is well-known comes from



144
"magi." Thus the "magus" was known in the
Hellenistic world as an astrologer and
occultist, even if he were not Persian.”100
Another strange element of this story is that as the
‘wise men’ would have been priests or
priest/astronomers and would have already known the
location of Jesus’ birth. As priests it would have been
much easier to make contact with High Priests in Israel than to obtain an audience with the king, and, given the subject matter - the birth of the Messiah - it would have been more likely that a meeting with the High Priests would have been their initial objective. According to Matthew, after the magi had visited him,
the priests of Israel were asked by Herod for the
birthplace of ‘the Messiah’ and he was reminded of
the prophecy made in Micah 5:2; “But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, are only a small village among all the people of Judah. Yet a ruler of Israel will come
from you, one whose origins are from the distant
past.”
This proves conclusively that the Magi would have received similar information if they had spoken with priests. If the Magi visit actually happened, the priests of Israel (who had acquired much of their tradition from
Egyptian religious teachings) would have been alerted
by the Magi or by Herod’s interest. In such
circumstances, with their interest sparked, they would
100 The three Magi, Zoroastrian pilgrims; Hannah M.G. Shaper



145
have involved themselves in the tracing of and (in the event) the protection of their Messiah (the anointed one). This story is puzzling in the extreme. Priests from a foreign religion would have given little credence to the Torah and its predictions; neither would they have been interested in the birth of someone fulfilling those predictions. If there was a visit by such priests, there must have been more to it ....... The eastern territories, including Persia and India were conquered by Alexander and administered by the Ptolemies thereafter. The Ptolemies were fanatical about the Pharaonic bloodline and by the idea that the Pharaoh was a divine king, inheriting lineage back to
Osiris. In addition, they controlled the dispensers of
religion as a way of controlling their ‘subjects’. For
these reasons, it is likely that priests and astronomers from the new territories would have been subjected to the essential elements of the Egyptian tradition, particularly those that mirrored their own beliefs. The similarities between Hindu, Zoroastrianism and the Egyptian regions have been noted, but these similarities pre-date any influence by the Ptolemaic dynasties. The important but limited element of the religion that could have interested them was that it descended directly from God and that the Pharaonic line had a direct connection with the first God-King.
This was the only aspect that might have impressed
Eastern ‘wise men’/magicians sufficiently to travel a
long distance to visit a new and unlikely successor to the Pharaonic title.



146
If all of these doubts are not enough, it is interesting to
note that the visit of the ‘The Wise Men’ is almost an
exact duplication of the story that was woven around the birth of the ancient Persian God Mithra;
“Mithra was born of the usual virgin on December 25th, the ‘Birthday of the Unconquered Sun’, which Christians adopted
in the 4th century CE and renamed Christmas.
Some said Mithra was the child of an
incestuous union between the ‘sun god’ or
Ahura Mazda and his own mother, just as
Jesus, who was God, was similarly born of the
Mother of God. Mithra’s birth was witnessed by shepherds and the ‘Three Wise Men’, known in Persia as Magi, magicians’ or ‘seers’.”101
“Mithra, the "mediator between God and
man", was visited by Magi at the time of his
birth and given gifts of gold, frankincense and
myrrh”102
Could it be that the story of the ‘Magi’ was simply a
duplication of this aspect of the Mithra nativity legend?

147
C. Why was Herod upset?
It was not uncommon in these times that there were
Judaic claimants to the title of ‘Messiah’ (divinely
appointed king). Two known ones are Simon of Peraea (who according to Josephus was a pyromaniac), Simon Magnus (the Samaritan), Judas the son of Hezakiah (mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles 5;37) and Anthronges all of whom were rebels and were killed by the Romans. Simon Magnus was mentioned by Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus and Epiphanius as a magician in Acts 8; 9-24. In apocryphal works, including the Acts of peter, Pseudo-Clementines, and the Epistle of the Apostles, Simon also appears as a formidable magician with the ability to levitate and fly at will. Given the existence of so many claimants, the existence of Jesus would not have been such a
dramatic announcement. However, it would have
caused anxiety, if the ‘wise men’ told Herod that the
infant was the son of an Egyptian God King, and was therefore divine by birth and the hereditary claimant of all title and territory that such a title involved. For the previous 300 years, save only for the late interruption of the Romans, Israel had been part of the Ptolemaic empire. It is not difficult to see that the appearance of a new and legitimate King of Egypt, who could claim the kingship of Israel, would certainly have been perceived as a threat to the Herodian dynasty that was being established by Herod the Great.



148
If the visit of the Magi is a true story and Herod did react, one can imagine that he would have been as keen to locate the father, Ptolemy XIII as he would have been to locate and eliminate the child. It is easy to see therefore why a now aged Ptolemy XIII (if alive) would have stayed in hiding. Conversely, it is hard to imagine why Persian seers who had their own religious traditions and loyalties would have been interested in the birth of someone who would perpetuate either the royal Egyptian bloodline or someone who might fulfil a questionable (in the Persian religious tradition) Hebrew prophecy. On
balance therefore, the evidence would seem to
indicate the possibility that both the visit of the ‘three wise men’ and the slaughter of the innocents did not
happen.
D. Why were the Holy Family directed to go to Egypt?
There is no historical record to show that the
‘slaughter of the innocents’ actually took place. If it did not happen, Matthew’s reason for the ‘flight to Egypt’ is removed. On that basis, its inclusion must have been to give reason for the family’s journey to
Egypt or to document a reason for recording the fact that the journey into Egypt took place. Either way, it is difficult to imagine any reason why the journey into Egypt would be mentioned if it did not happen.
Fig 10 The traditional route taken by The Holy Family



149
Fig 10 The traditional route taken by The Holy Family
If there is any truth in this story, the journey on foot would have taken some considerable time and would have involved significant risk to the group. There was most likely a trail used by commuters and a non-stop flow of migrants that would have been easy to follow but the needs for shelter, food and water and the needs of an infant would have all been impediments to progress. Additionally, if the group were following a trail and they were in fear for their lives, they would have left themselves exposed to inspection by and confrontation with Roman and Jewish authorities. The biblical record says nothing about where in Egypt Joseph took his family. If the group consisted of two



150
adults a donkey and an infant then progress would have been slow. An average of two kilometres per hour was probably the most they could have achieved. On that basis, each 100 kilometres would have taken 50 hours, which would have taken 4 days non-stop travelling for 12 hours per day. Conventional Christian tradition tells us that Joseph led his family into the delta about midway between the modern cities of Port Said and Suez and wound their way across the delta, making a number of stops. The Holy Family first stopped at the town of Basta near the large, modern city of Zagazig. Later, according to a local story, the family arrived in the delta town of Belbeis and from there moved on to the Roman fortress Babylon. The final leg took them to Upper Egypt and eventually to the Qousqam Mountains. This is a journey of over 400 kilometres, which (excluding any stopovers) would have taken 16 days non-stop travel. The same tradition says that the Holy Family lived in the Qousqam Mountains in a cave. It is in this cave that the angel is said to have appeared to Joseph, informing him that Herod was dead and instructing him to take the child and Mary back to their home.103 Acording to Coptic tradition, the family travelled from Sinai in the east to the Wadi Natroun in the West and then southward to Old Cairo and eventually
103 Biblical Egypt; S Kent Brown



151
to Assyut in the heart of Upper Egypt - a journey which have been considerably longer.104
Either way, their place of refuge must have been proximate to food and water. In addition, since there was still a strong Semitic presence in Egypt, the

152
likelihood would have been that they would have located themselves with or proximate to people who were sympathetic to them. Since the work of Emil Schürer in 1896 most scholars have agreed that Herod died at the end of March or early April in 4 BCE. However, Jimmy Akin recently published an analysis of the calculation of the date of Herod’s death in the National Catholic Register where he calculates the more likely date to be 1 BCE. If the Emil Shürer tradition is correct the Holy Family spent almost eighteen months in Egypt. If the Akin analysis is correct it was over 5 years. True or false, the more important question is; why Egypt? There would have been many places the group would have been able to hide that would have involved a shorter journey. Crossing the river Jordan would have created much less difficulty than a perilous 400 or 500 kilometre journey, much of it across the northern perimeter of the Sinai desert. It would seem that there must have been a connection or link of some kind; either a real connection or one in the mind of the author. Egypt seems to be important to the story that was being told. There are some suggestions that the gospel of Matthew was written by someone who was not himself Jewish and who was located in Alexandria, a major centre of Judaism at this time;
“The most convincing argument against the
author being Jewish is that he seems to



153
misunderstand Hebrew poetic technique in Matthew 21:1-11: he has Jesus ride in on both a donkey and a colt, in literal fulfilment of Zechariah 9:9, but any Jew (as well as Mark and Luke) would understand that Zechariah 9:9 refers to only one animal, and the repetition is poetic. Despite this difficulty, however, many scholars still regard the author as a Christian Jew. There is also disagreement about where the Gospel was written. The traditional location, still supported by several scholars, is Antioch, a known centre of Christian Judaism (see Galatians 2:11-14). But Galilee and Alexandria have also been suggested (Galilee as a centre of Pharisaic activity that could explain the emphasis on conflict with the Pharisees, Alexandria as another major centre of Judaism). There is more agreement about the date of the Gospel, which almost all scholars regard as being written after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. If Matthew used Mark as a source, then this is almost certain. Furthermore, the destruction of the city in the Jewish revolt against the Romans seems to be referred to in Matthew
22:7. The precise date of the Gospel is unknown,
but a date in the 80s CE is plausible”105
There is no doubt that the author of the Matthew Gospel, who is thought not to have been a contemporary of the person who has become known to
105 Introduction to Matthew’s Gospel; Maxim Cardew



154
us as Jesus Christ, saw a world in which Israel and Egypt were somehow connected.
Another element in the equation that linked Herod, Israel and Egypt was the relationship between Herod and Cleopatra VII and any claims to his territory that Cleopatra, her children or her associations with Rome brought about. There are several versions of this relationship varying from seduction to animosity on the part of Cleopatra. We are told by historians;
“The queen’s relationship with Herod was the
most frustrating of all her associations. The sole source is Josephus, much of whose material came
from someone that both dynasties knew well,
Nikolas of Damascus, tutor to Cleopatra’s
children and then long-time advisor to Herod.
The families of Cleopatra and Herod had been in
contact with one another since Herod’s father
Antipatros of Askalon had assisted in the restoration of Ptolemy XII in 55 BC when both future dynasties were in their teens. Eight years later Antipatros aided Caesar in the Alexandrian War and received Roman citizenship for his efforts. Power passed to the younger generation, with Cleopatra and Herod as rulers of their respective territories and eyeing each other suspiciously. Although Herod owed his kingship directly to Antonius and Octavian, the various territorial arrangements from 37 BCE to 34 BCE
favoured his rival Cleopatra, who allegedly
would have preferred his entire kingdom.”



155
“Nikola’s account, which made extensive use of Herod’s own memoirs, is highly positive; even
eulogistic, toward Herod and exceedingly negative about Cleopatra, but it presents a vivid
picture of two dynasts, which were highly
competitive about their conflicting territories.” “Despite such implications by Josephus, it seems
unlikely that Cleopatra attempted to further her
needs by trying to seduce Herod.”106
“When Herod fled from Judea to Alexandria in 40, he was well received by Cleopatra, who offered to appoint him as commander of her army. Anxious to reach Rome, Herod declined. After Herod became king of Judea, enmity developed between them, for his accession had frustrated Cleopatra's plans to annex Judea. Cleopatra incited Antony against Herod. She also lent a ready ear to the complaints of Alexandra, Mariamne's mother, who had quarrelled with Herod for refusing to appoint her son Aristobulus as high priest. Cleopatra openly sided with Alexandra and it was as a result of her intervention that Herod was required to account to Antony for the death of Aristobulus. Though Herod succeeded in saving his throne, he was compelled to cede to Cleopatra Jericho and its environs together with certain areas of Arabia. When Antony prepared for battle
106 Cleopatra: A Biography; Duane W Roller



156
against Augustus, Cleopatra ordered Herod to take up arms against the Arabians who had failed to discharge their debts. Herod, though fully aware of Cleopatra's enmity toward him, realized the extent of her influence on Antony, to whom he owed his kingdom and accordingly took pains to prevent their personal differences from jeopardizing his position. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Herod had counselled Antony to do away with Cleopatra, as was rumoured to Augustus. It is possible that Cleopatra's feelings toward Herod may have caused her evident dislike of the Jews of Alexandria. Cleopatra ruled for over 20 years, taking her life at the age of 39 after Augustus' victory over Antony. There is a reference in the Talmud (Tosef., Nid. 4:17; Nid.
30b) to Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, but it is
unclear which Cleopatra is meant. “107
Whatever the truth of it, it is most certainly the case that rumours of a child of Ptolemy XIII who had a directly inherited claim to the Egyptian Pharaonic crown (and the territories that this post would claim to be rightfully theirs) would have been seen as a threat to the Herodian dynasty that Herod had struggled to establish. It would certainly have been a much greater threat to Herod than news of a hypothetical Messiah brought to him by a group of Persian magicians.

157
There is one additional aspect of this analysis, which warrants examination. This is the inclusion in Matthew 2; 14-15 of the verses; ‘And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, and remained there until the
death of Herod. This was to fulfil/perfect what the Lord had
spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt have I called my son.”
The prophet mentioned is believed to refer to Hosea 11; 1-2 who says;
1 “When Israel was a child, then I loved
him, and called my son out of Egypt. 2 As they called them, so they went from them:
they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned
incense to graven images”
What Matthew is saying is: In confirmation of Hosea 11:1 God first called His son Israel out of Egypt. In his second verse, the prophet Hosea says, "As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images." In other words, the Israelites were
called out of Egypt, but they served the Baalim and the graven
images instead of the ‘true God’.
What Matthew tells us is that in Jesus, this history was perfected. The Israelites were called out of Egypt, but were imperfect in serving Baalim. But Jesus was called out of Egypt, and unlike his predecessors he was perfect. We can deduce therefore that the Israelites brought traditions out of Egypt, which were tied to and were a continuation of the rites of the Egyptian religion. This is confirmation of the passages in the book of Genesis, that tell us that Moses



158
threatened with death those who held onto the Egyptian religious traditions. What Matthew also tells us by implication is that during his stay, Jesus had encountered the same Egyptian tradition.
The Gospel of Matthew attempts to portray the principal subject of his stories as someone whose existence and actions fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. In addition, it endeavours to portray Jesus as someone more than human by many references to God, the Son of God and the Son of (a) Man. In the process, it displays an ongoing and underlying link between Jesus and Egypt and portrays elements of the Egyptian Pharaonic religion. In doing this, it helps to provide further circumstantial evidence in support of our general hypothesis and it gives no information or claim which precludes the hypothesis from being valid.
Over and above the underlying connections between Hebrews and Egypt brought about by many centuries of residence in Egypt, ongoing longstanding transmigration and by being ruled and influenced by Egyptian Pharaohs and their priests there seems to have been a special relationship between Jesus and Egypt established very early in his life. This relationship
appears to have been directed by those persons
guiding/instructing Jesus’ parents.



159
Chapter 10 Clues in the New Testament
The most obvious places in the New Testament where we
should search for passages that would negate our hypothesis,
would be references to God, references to Jesus as ‘Son’ or any mentions by Jesus of his ‘father’.
Where appropriate we will attempt to determine whether the statements could be a reference to an earthly father, or to a
divine status that might have been brought about by his or his
father’s Pharaonic status.
Matthew makes many references to ‘god’, the ‘father’ and the
‘son’, some of which are listed below. Interestingly, each of these can be explained in the context of ancient Egyptian beliefs;
5 34 Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; 35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool;
5 16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
5 48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.



160
6 9 This, then, is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
7 21 "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven
10 32 "Whoever acknowledges me before men; I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.
11 25 At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. 26 Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. 27 All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
16.16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the (anointed one), the Son of the living God.”
16 27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and



161
then he will reward each person according to what he has done.
18 10 For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven
26.64 Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of (a) Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
28 18 Then Jesus came to them and said; "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.”
To explain how these quotations have a link to ancient Egyptian beliefs, it is necessary to outline key elements of these beliefs that could be pertinent to our analysis: Many of the Egyptian beliefs are laid out in the Book of the Dead. This book, which is collection of authentic Egyptian texts, tells us that Heaven and the Court of the Gods was in and around the constellation of Ursa Major – described as The
Thigh or The Great Bear;
“The Osiris Ani saith:-. I am he who sendeth
forth light over the Thigh of heaven. I come
forth in heaven.”108
108 The Book of the Dead; THE CHAPTER OF LIFTING UP THE FEET, AND OF COMING FORTH ON THE EARTH; E A Wallis Budge



162
“As for those gods, the Lords of Justice. They are
Seth and Isdes, Lord of the West. As for the tribunal which is behind Osiris, Imsety, Hapy,
Duamutef and Qebehsenuef, it is these who are
behind the Great Bear in the northern sky.”109
In ancient times the North Pole position was in the Ursa Major
constellation and the group of seven stars we know as ‘the plough’ revolved around the pole position.
“Behold my shape is turned upside down. I am
Wennefer, season by season, whose attributes
come unto him one by one when he travels
around.”110
From Egypt, the constellation was low in the northern sky. It rotated around the pole position and as it did so, it crossed the Sky, backwards and forwards, across the bottom arc and top arc of its circular movement, but it did not fall below the horizon. Inside the cup of the constellation is the shape of a regular pentagon and the everlasting and infinite shape of a pentagram star111
“Happy are you O Osiris! You have appeared in
glory, you have power, you are a spirit; you have

163
made your shape everlasting; and your face is that of Anubis. Ra rejoices over you and he is well disposed towards your beauty. You have seated yourself on the pure throne which Geb, who loves you, made for you; you receive him in
your arms in the West, you cross the sky
daily,”112
“The imperishable stars are under thy
supervision, and the stars which never set are thy
throne”113
“....the stars which never rest sing hymns of praise unto thee, and the stars which are
imperishable glorify thee as thou sinkest to rest in
the horizon of Manu.”114
One other single important element of Egyptian belief that is pertinent to this analysis is the Egyptian conviction that upon the death of a Pharaoh, he ascended to the heavens (the area around Ursa Major) and joined Osiris and the other God Kings and that they were visible as a major star in or near the constellation. Ordinary people who lived good lives ascended to become stars and they too could be seen in the Northern sky.

164
Thus we can see that the quotations from Matthew above are all consistent with these essential elements of Egyptian religious belief.
As astronomer-priest’s observations became more
sophisticated, the Egyptians came to believe that when the sun came up and hid the northern stars, it travelled through the underworld, allowing the circumpolar stars to rotate to their (morning) starting position the next day.
“The Pyramid texts also reflect a belief in an astral afterlife among the circumpolar stars...”115
“The Egyptian religion, old beliefs were rarely
discarded, new ideas and concepts were merely tacked on, even when in direct contradiction to existing views. That is why the Egyptians could believe in an afterlife in which the deceased would spend eternity in the company of the circumpolar stars as an akh, at the same time as being restricted to the burial chamber and offering chapel of the tomb as a ka, but also visiting the world of the living, inhabiting the Elysian Fields and travelling across the sky and
through the underworld with the sun god as a
ba”116.

165
If Jesus Christ’s father was Ptolemy XIII, and if we assume
that the popular date of the Nativity of 6 BCE to be correct, the child would have been conceived when his father was
some 55/56 years old. This means that if Ptolemy was still
alive at the time Jesus started his ‘ministry’, he would have
been 85 years old. This means that (if alive) Ptolemy XIII
would have been an old man at the time of Jesus reported
baptism by John. In relation to Jesus’ baptism Matthew’s
gospel tells us;
3 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan
to be baptized by John. 14 But John tried to deter
him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” 15 Jesus replied, “Let it be
so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfil all righteousness.” Then John consented. 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 And a voice from
heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with
him I am well pleased.”
This claim that the ‘father’s’ voice was heard is duplicated in
the other three gospels (Mark 1:1-8, Luke 3:1-20, John 1: 19
28). These assertions by the gospel writers that a heavenly
voice was heard (who claimed to be Jesus’ father) at the
Baptism of Jesus (and also at the Transfiguration) would seem
to indicate that the writers believed Jesus’ ‘father’ to be dead
and living in Heaven. This view is suspect - a ‘voice from Heaven’ would have frightened and scattered the throng at the



166
crowded baptism ceremony and since such a fright is not mentioned, the interpretation is most implausible. The claim was probably made therefore to embellish the text and enhance the emerging view that Jesus was divine, (in the sense of mystical) and that he was directly linked to a God that was almighty, eternal, incarnate and at the same time interested in the inhabitants of the tiny planet named earth, occupied by humanity. If the words were said, they were more likely to have been spoken by a human voice and heard (and reported) by the group of followers who had accompanied Jesus to the event.
Returning to the extracts from Matthew, at the beginning of
this chapter, each of them (other than the first) can be
explained in the context of Egyptian religious belief and Jesus’
earthly God King Father (Ptolemy) either still alive or
departed to live in Heaven. In this latter context, ‘my father in Heaven’ and ‘our father in Heaven’ ‘your heavenly father’ or ‘Father, Lord of Heaven’ would refer to the eternal Egyptian
God of Heaven, with all his various names and configurations (Ra, Amen, Tuth, Seth, Osiris, etc) or to Ptolemy himself if he had died and was believed to have joined the pantheon of
Gods in the Heavens.
Jesus is quoted as calling himself ‘the Son of (a) man’ and claims that ‘All authority in heaven and on earth has been
given to me’; a claim that could only be made by a legitimate
Pharaoh who has the designation ‘Son of God’, who is
claiming his title and the authority of his position.
The reference to ‘God’s throne’ in the verse of Matthew 5; 34
(the first in the list above) is a direct reference to one of the cornerstones of the Egyptian religious tradition where heaven



167
is that part of the sky, which houses the Ursa Major constellation and the throne is embedded within it.
“It is I who cause Osiris to be a spirit, and I
have made content those who are in his suite. I desire that they grant fear of me and create respect of me among those who are in their midst, for I am lifted aloft on my
standard, on my throne and on my allotted
seat.”117
Fig 12 The throne and the eye that spell Wsir – the name of Osiris in the heart of the Ursa Major constellation
117 Book of the Dead, Spell 85; R O Faulkner



168
This is confirmed in the Book of Revelation, which tells us;
... peace from the (one) who is and the (one) who was and the (one) who coming and from the seven spirits which are before the throne of him. Rev 1; 4
And behold a throne is set in Heaven and on the throne a sitting one. Rev 4; 2
References to God, the father and the son in the other three Gospels are shown below and the explanation of each in the context of ancient Egyptian religious belief is shown alongside the quotation:
Mark 1 1- The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God
This claim that Jesus was ‘the Son of God’ can be explained
by him, as the legitimate Pharaoh (God King) having this title as his nomen
Mark 1 24 "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"
In the book of the dead it is normally Osiris who is described
as ‘holy’; “and the gods who live in the horizon ascribe unto



169
me praises, as the divine Spirit-body, the Lord of mortals. I am
exalted like that holy god who dwelleth in the Great House”118
Mark 3 10 For he had healed many, so that those with diseases/plagues were pushing forward to touch him. 11 Whenever the unclean (evil) spirits beheld him, they prostrated themselves before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God." 12 But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.
Jesus asking anyone not to ‘tell’ who he was does not ring
true. Why would he want this to be hidden? The only logical
reason would be that these three verses of Mark’s gospel relate
to Jesus having been recognised as the Son of Ptolemy XIII and he was instructing those that recognised him to keep it quiet. This in turn implies that they had seen Jesus before in
the company of his father and it is entirely possible that during
the 30 years prior to the commencement of his ‘ministry’ this
could have happened.
Mark 8 38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes known/is established in/by his Father's /judgement/splendour with/behind the holy angels
118 The Book of the Dead; the Chapter of being transformed into the Prince of the Tchatchau Chiefs; E A Wallis Budge



170
Again we can see the similarities to quotations from the Book of the Dead which give us clues to the Egyptian creed; “If any god, or any goddess, attack the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, when he setteth out, the Ancestor of the year who liveth upon hearts [Osiris] shall eat him when he cometh forth from Abydos, and the Ancestors of Ra shall reckon with him, and the Ancestors of Light shall reckon with him. [He is] a god of
splendour [arrayed in] the apparel of heaven, and he is
among the Great Gods”119
Mark 15 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice; "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? "--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
Eminent Historians have claimed that this outcry from the
Cross is spoken in Egyptian; “.... the words assigned to the
sufferer, are Egyptian: Lama or Rama, denotes weeping; Remi was the weeper in Rem-Rem. Sabak means to be prostrate and
utterly subdued, Tani, is to bow the forehead. Instead of these
words John says; “When Jesus received the vinegar he said, It is finished; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.”
Now it is noteworthy that the one version should be a rendering of the other, (the gospels of Mark and John) according to Egyptian. Heli (Heri) means it is finished ended, to fly away, give up the ghost, and ascend as a sprit. Any Egyptologist will know that Heli-heli-lama-Sakak-tanti contains and conveys the sense of heli, to be ended (in giving
119 Ibid THE CHAPTER OF ADVANCIN.G TO THE TCHATCHAU CHIEFS OF OSIRIS



171
up the ghost); lama, to weep; sabak be prostrate; and tani, to bow down the forehead. He will also know that as such it is a
description by another speaker and not a dramatic utterance by
the sufferer; and John’s version is a descriptive narrative except in the words “it is finished,” which as Heli-heli” might
express the giving up the spirit by whomsoever they were said.
If the words were Egyptian, heli would naturally become eli,
as a Semitic form.”120
As an observer of logic, it is the author’s view that the phrase could equally have been an incantation of God’s names; Eli,
Eli, Ra Ma’at, Sebek Hathor Neith. Eli was one of the two
most frequently used deity names amongst Proto-Jewish
Western Semites.121 ‘L’ and ‘R’ are interchangeable when
used in Egyptian pronunciation of the unilateral hieroglyphic
and only the ‘Ma’ of ‘Ma’at’ would have been heard.122 Most
of these names are those of Egyptian Gods and would substantiate the view that in an extreme situation the person called out in his natural tongue, which if this is valid, would appear to have been Egyptian.
Luke too refers to Jesus as the Son;
Luke 1 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
120 The Natural Genesis, Vol 2; Gerald Massey 121 Collected Works of Sri Bhati Anada Goswami 122 Egyptian Language; Phonetic System and Pronunciation; Luigi Tripani



172
This could be interpreted to mean the Jesus was a descended from Thutmose III and had legitimate claim to the Pharaonic throne
Luke 2 48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you." 49 "Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?" 50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
The translation of the Greek word τοῖς as ‘the house’ is creative translation. The word appears to be plural not
singular. In addition, there is an abundance of possible
translations for πατρός (chosen as ‘father’) and the word itself
is genitive - therefore the translation could be more accurate if
it read; ‘I was obliged to be with these of my ancestry’. This of
course provokes the question; what ancestry?
Luke 10 22 "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
It is interesting that this reads ‘knows who the father is’ rather
than ‘knows the father’ – obviously the author wished to portray that the identity of the father and son was of



173
significance. This would make sense if the father was an earthly father, who was keeping his identity secret. If it became known the Ptolemy XIII was the father of Jesus and that he was still alive, the safety of both father and son would have been unsure.
Luke 22 29 And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, 30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel
Here Jesus acknowledges that a kingdom was conferred upon him – this would make sense if Jesus thought that he had claim to the kingdom of Egypt and its territories.
Luke 22 66 At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. 67 "If you are the Christ (anointed one)" they said, "tell us!" Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me, 68 and if I asked you, you would not answer 69 (Some time) from now, but the Son of Man also will be sitting at the right hand of the power of God." 70 They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You say I am." 71 Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from His own lips."



174
If Jesus believed himself to be of the Royal bloodline, this statement may well relate to his belief concerning his physical place in the Heavens after his death.
John 1 51 He then added, "I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven opened, and the angels/emissaries of God ascending and descending on/over the Son of Man."
This is an interesting description of Heavenly events and may well relate to the fact that the sky appears to rotate and therefore, all stars external to those at the centre of the rotation appear to rise and/or fall over/above the stars nearer the centre. The emissaries/messengers of God may also be the planets that move independent to the heavenly rotation of the stars around the northern pole position.
John 5 43 I have come in my Father's name
In addition to the nomen given to all pharaohs (son of Ra), the
name of Ptolemy XIII was ‘Theos Philopator’ (Θεός Φιλοπάτωρ) – meaning ‘God loving His Father’. This
statement in John attributes to Jesus the inherited qualities of
his father. If John 5 43 does not relate to ‘Theos Philopator’ as
its definition of his ‘father’s name’, what ‘father’s name’ does it refer to? Nowhere in John is there a statement of Jesus’ father’s name (other than Joseph) and we must assume that, as
it is not given, the reader is expected to know what it is. Even
more esoteric documents from the period avoid specifying the
father’s name. The Gospel of Truth, one of the Nag Hammadi
scrolls (that will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter)



175
contains extensive commentary on the question of the name of the father. Despite that, it does not actually specify what the name is;
Who, then, has been able to pronounce a name for him, this great name, except him alone to whom the name belongs and the sons of the name in whom the name of the Father is at rest, and who themselves in turn are at rest in his name, since the Father has no beginning? It is he alone who engendered it for himself as a name in the beginning before he had created the Aeons, that the name of the Father should be over their heads as a lord - that is, the real name, which is secure by his authority and by his perfect power. For the name is not drawn from lexicons nor is his name derived from common name-giving, But it is invisible. He gave a name to himself alone, because he alone saw it and because he alone was capable of giving himself a name. For he who does not exist has no name. For what name would one give him who did not exist? Nevertheless, he who exists also with his name and he alone knows it, and to him alone the Father gave a name. The Son is his name. He did not, therefore, keep it secretly hidden, but the son came into existence. He himself gave a name to him. The name, then, is that of the Father, just as the name of the Father is the Son. For otherwise, where would compassion find a



176
name - outside of the Father? But someone will probably say to his companion, "Who would give a name to someone who existed before himself, as if, indeed, children did not receive their name from one of those who gave them birth?" Above all, then, it is fitting for us to think this point over: What is the name? It is the real name. It is, indeed, the name which came from the Father, for it is he who owns the name. He did not, you see, get the name on loan, as in the case of others because of the form in which each one of them is going to be created. This, then, is the authoritative name. There is no one else to whom he has given it. But it remained unnamed, unuttered, `till the moment when he, who is perfect, pronounced it himself; and it was he alone who was able to pronounce his name and to see it.123
This passage compounds the problem – why is no actual name given. If the name of the Father is so important, why cannot it be known? Or is it that those writing these texts were endeavouring to be careful not to stipulate it? Were they hiding the name for a practical reason – that to announce it would be dangerous for them or that it would serve to destroy the foundations of the theology they were endeavouring to
123 The Gospel of Truth (Nag Hammadi Library); translated by Robert M Grant



177
establish. Either way, it implies that the authors knew the origins of the secret that their words were trying to perpetuate.
An interesting alternative explanation lies in the definition of
the ancient Hebrew word for ‘Son’; This Hebrew word is
derived out of the parent root בן (ben, Strong's #1121). In the
original Hebrew alphabet, this word was written as . The first picture is a picture of a tent, our house. The second
picture is of a germinating seed, but it can also mean to
“continue” as a seed continues the next generation. When combined these letters mean “continue the house” and is the
Hebrew word for a “son,” the one who continues the line of the house
124
If this is what the authors were trying to say, then they must have been aware of the importance of the bloodline and were talking about the only lineage of that time that could have been of any significance; the line of the God Kings of Egypt.
Other interesting mentions of ‘father’ and ‘son’ in John’s
Gospel are somewhat more philosophical and include references to Jesus relationship with his father;
John 8 19 Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also."
124
Biblical Word of the Month – Stone; Jeff A. Benner



178
There are two possible meanings to this statement – either Jesus is talking to Hebrews who are ignorant of the Egyptian
tradition and who would not therefore know of the location of
‘the father’ in the Heavens or he was talking about his earthly
father Ptolemy XIII. On balance it is likely that he meant the
latter since this would fit with ‘you do not know me’
meaning; you do not know that I am the son of Ptolemy XIII and the rightful God King in the Pharaonic tradition.
John 8 28 So Jesus said, "When/as long as you have lifted up/exalted/honoured the Son/posterity of Man/mankind/God, then you will know that I am/exist and that I do/form/make/constitute/ produce nothing on my own but speak just what/these (words) the Father has taught me.
The Greek words that constitute this verse have many possible meanings when they are translated into English. Whatever the
translation, it seems most likely this statement relates to the
‘lifting up’ or exaltation of Jesus’ father Ptolemy XIII (the son of God). In other words Jesus is saying; ‘I wait to take my place as the ‘Son of God’ until my father is in Heaven - (then
you will know me in my new role) and then I speak the words
my father has taught (that are pertinent to the role)’. For this to
be an accurate meaning Ptolemy XIII would have needed to still be alive at the time the words were spoken and for this to be the case, Ptolemy XIII would have needed to be circa 85/86 years old. The verse could be read as an announcement of Jesus’ father’s approaching death, which (if so) would probably have been mentioned in the Gospels.



179
The story of ‘death’ that fits well with such a scenario is the
later visit by Jesus to Bethany (where he had enemies and had
previously been abused) to visit the dead/dying Lazarus,
where reportedly Jesus wept and it was said; “see how he loved him!” In the context of Egyptian religion, the ‘raising’
of a pharaoh can mean the raising of him to be a star in Heaven and this could account for the wording in John, where
he never actually states that Lazarus comes back to life only
that ‘the dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in
strip of linen’ – in other words he did not walk and was probably carried out. It is possible therefore that Lazarus was the pseudonym of Ptolemy and that the story relates to the death of Jesus true father.
Significantly, the coverage of this story in John 11 tells us that
one member of Lazarus’ family is Mary, who many eminent
students of the New Testament believed to have been Mary Magdalene; a subject that we will return to in a later chapter.
John 8 54 Jesus replied, "If I glorify/praise myself, my glory/opinion means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies/honours/praises me. 55 Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.
This verse (as was the previous verse we examined) was part
of the Sermon on the Mount and was addressed at the ‘Jews who believed him’. In a later chapter we will show that this
probably referred to Essenes, the forerunners of Gnostic Christians who were the Jews that protected many of the



180
ancient the sacred Egyptian traditions that linked them back
directly to Isis and Osiris and who would have revered the
holder of the bloodline as a God King. In this context, Jesus’
words indicate that he follows the instructions that he was given by his father and that he is an obedient son who will protect the instructions that his father has given him.
John 10 34 Jesus answered them; "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods/judges'? 35 If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken—36 what about the one whom the Father sanctified/blessed (set apart as his very own) and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?
This verse refers to Psalm 82 which talks of people making judgements of those less fortunate than themselves and
reinforces the fact that those addressed are gods in that they
make judgements of others but that ‘ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes’. It was spoken at the Festival of
Dedication (Hanukkah) in Jerusalem when opponents picked up stones to stone him for blasphemy.
The words as quoted indicate that Jesus had a fervent belief in his status and was attempting to explain it. It is interpreted by Christians to mean that Jesus was claiming to be the Son of God incarnate. The words could equally have been those of Jesus claiming his heritance as the first son of the last surviving God King, Ptolomy XIII.



181
John 12 49 For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it 50 I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."
This could well refer to Jesus earthly father Ptolemy XIII who has given Jesus strict instructions of about what he should say and how he should say it.
The Egyptian context can be illustrated by ‘A hymn of praise
to Ra’, and by the first of the chapter of ‘coming forth by day’
contained in the Book of the Dead;
“Let me not be kept captive [by the tomb], and let me not
be turned back [on my way]. Let the members of my body be made new again when I contemplate thy beauties, even as are the members of all thy favoured ones, because I am one of those who worshipped thee upon earth. Let me arrive in the Land of Eternity, let me enter into the Land of
Everlastingness. This, O my Lord, behold thou shalt ordain
for me.” 125
“Ra commanded Thoth to prove true the words of Osiris
before his enemies; what was commanded [for Osiris], let
that be done for me by Thoth” 126
125 The Papyrus of Ani; The Book of the Dead; E A Wallis Budge 126 Ibid



182
John 16 25 "Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father 26 In that day you will ask in/with (the memory of) my name. I am not saying that I will ask/question the Father on your behalf/concerning you. 27 No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God
This verse is conclusive in its statement that Jesus has been
‘talking figuratively’. We are being told quite clearly and
unambiguously that it has been necessary to read between the
lines to get to the truth.
The passage goes on to say; ‘a time is coming’ – in other words, it hasn’t arrived yet – ‘when I will tell you plainly about my Father’. In fact, there is nothing in the following
chapters of John that might constitute such an explanation of the father. This can only mean that if there ever was an explanation, it was removed or that it was included in a way that it is not immediately obvious. A removal is the most plausible explanation and it would be understandable the text removed flew in the face of the Christian proclamation of Jesus as the Son of God incarnate, the central proposition of Pauline Christianity.
ALL of these verses can relate to Jesus knowledge of, his relationship with and the instructions he might have received from his earthly father. Ptolemy XIII would have believed that



183
he was the ‘Son of God’ who would, through Jesus, perpetuate
what he believed to be a divine bloodline back to Osiris.
One of the most profound instructions relating to ‘the Father’
which was attributed to Jesus was in The Lord’s Prayer, which
defined Jesus’ suggested way of praying to God the Father.
This prayer is mentioned in Matthew 6; 9-13 and in Luke 11; 1-4
Matt; 6 9-13 Thus therefore pray you; Father of us, which (is) in the heavens, hallowed be the name of you, let come the kingdom of you, let be done the will of you, as in heaven (so) also on/over earth, the bread of us daily give us today and forgive us the debts of us as also we forgive the debtors of us. And not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory for the ages AMEN.
Luke 11 2-4 Father of us who (is) in heaven hallowed be the name of you, let come the kingdom of you, let be done the will of you as in heaven also upon earth. The bread of us daily give us each day and forgive us the sins of us also indeed ourselves we forgive everyone indebted to us and not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil.
Both versions include the invocation; ‘hallowed be the name
of you’, which seems strange since it does not state the name to which it refers.



184
The name of God in Egyptian, Greek and Hebrew is traceable in the stars in and around the constellation of Ursa Major, and this illustration is alluded to in various chapters of the Book of Revelation;
2.13 I know where thou dwellest where (is) the throne of the Satan and thou holdest the name of me and not thou didst deny the faith of me even in the days of Antipas
2.17 and on/over the stone a name new written which no man knows except the (one) receiving (it)
9.11 They have over them a king the angel of the abyss name to him in Hebrew Abaddon and in the Greek name he has Apollyon
19.12 the (ones) but eyes of him a flame of fire and on/over the head/top of him diadems many having a name written which no one knows except he
19.16 and on/over the thigh of him a name written king of kings and lord of lords
Possible representations of these names of gods can be obtained by joining up stars in the Ursa Major constellation. Names that cover these extracts from the Book of Revelation are shown below;



185
Fig13 Wsir, the name of Osiris (in Ursa Major) in Heaven
Fig 14 The name of Apollo (over Ursa Major) in the Heavens



186
Fig 15 The name Abaddon (in Hebrew) written in the stars of Ursa Major
Fig 16 The name Yahweh – the God of the Hebrews written in the stars of Ursa Major
Such representations may be appropriate in light of the first
verse of John’s Gospel; “In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God”, since we
know that in the Egyptian pantheon, God was an aspect of these same stars. In this context, it is perhaps strange that



187
Jesus did not suggest any of these possibilities as the name to
be ‘hallowed’. The word ‘hallowed’ means ‘holy’ or ‘respected’. The exhortation, ‘hallowed be thy name’, could fit with the
Hebrew name ‘Yahweh’, since by early post-biblical times, the name Yahweh had ceased to be pronounced aloud, except once a year by the High Priest in the Holy of Holies. However,
if this or any of the other names written in Heaven are the
name alluded to in the Lord’s Prayer, and the followers of
Jesus were aware of the name being referred to, it would not
fit that they were not perpetuated in the Christian tradition.
Going back to the words of ‘the Lord’s Prayer’, Matthew’s
gospel may provide a simpler answer to the exhortation to
hallow the lord’s name. This version of the prayer clearly and
explicitly states; ‘For yours is the kingdom and the power and
the glory for the ages AMEN’
Amen is the name of the Egyptian God of Gods, and in his role as Amon-Ra he could certainly have been thought of as Father/King of the Gods. Together with Osiris Amun-Ra is the most widely recorded of the Egyptian gods and was the chief deity of the Egyptian religion. Amun-Ra also came to be worshipped outside of Egypt and came to be identified with Zeus in Ancient Greece and Jupiter in the Roman pantheon. Amun/Amon/Amen was sometimes known as Amaunet and is mentioned at length in the Old Egyptian pyramid texts. His name Amun (written imn, pronounced Amana in ancient
Egyptian), means "hidden".
Certainly, the ongoing, repetitive use of ‘Amen’ (the name of one of Egypt’s greatest gods) throughout the Christian world
would seem to indicate that the wish indicated in second line
of ‘the Lord’s prayer’; ‘Hallowed be they name’ has not been



188
knowingly achieved. No one considers the word/name ‘Amen’
to be holy, yet it is only ever used in the context of prayer and
religious ceremony, which gives it a ‘hallowed’ connotation.
Perhaps it is important that we ask why no one has ever
queried the routine use of the Egyptian God of God’s name at
the end of their prayers and to the other references to the name of an Egyptian god in the gospels;
Matt 28 19 Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age Amen.
Mark 16 19-20 [19] So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. [20] And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following Amen.
Luke 24 53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God Amen
These links to the constellation of Ursa Major and to the name
‘Amen’, the name of the Father of the Gods are confirmed in
The Book of Revelation:



189
Rev 3 1 These things says the one having the seven spirits of the one God and the seven stars, I know your deeds that the characterisation you have that you are alive and yet dead you are
Rev 3 14 These things says the Amen, the witness, the one faithful and true, the beginning of the creation of the one God.
Christian zealots have attempted to confuse the faithful by
claiming that ‘Amen’ means; so be it!127 Others have claimed
that it means ‘truly!’128 or that the use of ‘Amen’ in early Judeo/Christian times was similar to the phrase ‘God bless!”
as it used today129. The word is used 129 times in the New Testament and we acknowledge that it would be impossible for Christian theologians to admit that it refers to the Egyptian God of
Gods, Amen-Ra. If they did so, it would (by definition) mean
that the ‘God’ of Christians was the same person as the ancient ‘God’ of the Egyptians and that would mean that Jesus had as much claim to eternity as did Osiris, the first mythical ‘Son of God’. That said, it is strong evidence of the link between Jesus
and the Egyptian pantheon.
We have not analysed the New Testament line by line, a task we will vacate to far more eminent un-biased scholars than ourselves.
127 Baker’s Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology - Amen 128 Ibid
129 Use of the Word ‘Amen’; R Dean Anderson, Jr



190
All in all however, it can be seen clearly from this brief analysis that the New Testament could well be referring to Jesus in his role as the rightful Pharaoh, son of Ptolemy XIII
and of Mary a direct descendant of Thutmose III and that the
claims to the title ‘Son of God’ could relate to his divine birthright as defined by the Egyptian tradition and to Jesus’
position in the sacred Pharaonic bloodline that goes back to Osiris, the first God King.
Christians will condemn this hypothesis as it undermines their
‘faith’. They will perhaps call on the miracles Jesus that is
reported to have performed and more significantly the death and resurrection of Jesus that is claimed in the gospels as evidence that he was/is God incarnate. It is certainly true that if Jesus Christ lived and he actually died and was resurrected three days after his death, there would exist a significant argument to back the Christian claim.
We were not there and cannot know what actually happened.
The best we can do is look at the reports and play ‘devils’ advocate’ to identify interpretations of the texts that might
permit us to question Christian orthodoxy and promote our hypothesis. To that end we must look at Jesus reported death and resurrection.
Our examination first looks at the descriptions of Jesus’ death
in the four gospels and attempts to find any discrepancies;
Luke 23 46 states; ‘And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, "Father, INTO YOUR
HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT." Having said
this, He breathed His last.’..... 49 And all his



191
acquaintances and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things
Matthew 27 50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit...... 55 many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee while ministering to him. Among them was Mary Magdalene and Mary the Mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee
Mark 15 37 And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last/gave up the ghost..... 40 There were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the Less and (of) Joses, and Salome.
John 19 26; When Jesus then saw His mother, and the pupil/disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son/pupil!" 27 then He said to the disciple/pupil, "Behold, your mother!" From that hour the disciple/pupil took her into his own household...... 30 Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!" And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit/the ghost.......33 but coming to Jesus when they saw that he was already dead, they



192
did not break his legs. 34 But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out. 35 And he who has seen has testified and his testimony is true; and he knows that is telling the truth (and he testifies) so that you also may believe.
The first and most obvious inconsistency is that between the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke which state that the women in attendance were standing afar off or at a distance, and that of John, which claims that Jesus saw the disciple he loved and his mother nearby. The justification given in John is that the person testifying was there, implying that the authors of the other three gospels were not and that their versions are
inaccurate. If this is true, the versions in Matthew, Mark and
Luke would be based on hearsay and the veracity of Christ’s
death as reported hinges entirely on the version given in the gospel of John.
The next most significant statement that invites scepticism is again in the testimony attributed to John, which states that Jesus was dead and that when pierced with the spear blood
immediately came from the wound. This contradicts what is
known about the body’s functions after death: At the moment
of death the heart stops and blood is no longer being pumped
around the body. The process of gravity will mean that it will
fall the body’s lowest extremities and that if the body is ‘pierced’ in the lateral area, there may be seepage but no spurt
or significant flow of blood will occur.



193
These two inconsistencies are exacerbated by the intense
assertion in John, that the ‘testimony is true’ – leading us to
speculate why the author believed that his testimony might be
doubted. He admits that the testimony is written as it is, ‘so that you also might believe’ but this assertion itself, creates
doubt in the veracity of the statements made. What it was in the testimony that the reader might disbelieve? Given the importance in retrospect of Jesus being dead (if it would be claimed that he had risen) we can only speculate that Jesus was not in fact dead and that the elaborate scene to put the author (or the person relating this story to the author) within earshot of the last gasping words of Jesus, was
contrived in order to add reinforcement to a required belief in
the authenticity of Jesus’ death.
Jesus’ resurrection, which required his death, was the event
which proved that Jesus was God incarnate. Without his death,
he could not have ‘risen from the dead’.
With regard to the resurrection, there are three possibilities
o Jesus did not die and therefore there was no resurrection – the story was a fabrication.
o Jesus did die but there was no resurrection and the stories of such an event were false.
o Jesus did die and he was resurrected
None of the four gospels tell of the actual awakening of Jesus from the dead.
In John, Mary Magdalene found the tomb open and went to
Peter and ‘the other disciple Jesus loved’ to tell him that the



194
body had been moved. They went to the tomb and found the linen Jesus had been wrapped in but no body. Peter leaves then Mary has an encounter with Jesus.
In all the other three gospels Mary Magdalene and other
women were met by a man ‘in bright clothes’ who tells them; “He has risen!” In Luke, the women are reminded that Jesus
had prophesied that he would be crucified and after three days
rise again.’ In Mark they were instructed to “...go tell His disciple and Peter” and in Matthew they were told to; “Go quickly and tell his disciples!”
Again we have discrepancies concerning the attendees
between the gospel accounts. In particular ‘the disciple Jesus
loved’ was in attendance in the gospel of John and in none of
the other three. At the very least this means that the stories are written by people who were not there and that they rely on accounts that have been transmitted by word of mouth. At worst it implies some dishonesty in the reports of the most important event in the life of Jesus Christ.
One strange element of text concerning the resurrection occurs in a Gnostic gospel of Marcion (refuted as a heresy by Hippolytus) and in the canonical Gospel of Luke and confirmed in Jesus encounter with Thomas;
“But they were terrified and affrighted, and
supposed that they had beheld a phantom. 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings arise in your hearts? 39 Behold my hands and my feet, that I



195
am myself: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.130
"See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."131
“Then He said to Thomas, "Reach here with
your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing."132
These texts claim that Jesus showed himself to be flesh and bones. In other words he was corporeal and in any human sense of the word, alive. Does this point to the possibility that Jesus did not die?
The Jesus prophecy (mentioned in the Luke version of the resurrection) is mentioned in three gospels and in two of these, it is mentioned twice. If these were instructions rather than predictions, then Jesus was trying hard to ensure that the events would unfold in a particular way.
Luke 9 22 .... “The Son of Man must suffer
many things and be rejected by the elders and
130 Fragments of the faith forgotten; The Gospel of Marcion translated by G R S Mead 131 Luke 24; 39 132 John 20;27



196
chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be
raised up on the third day”
Matthew 16 21 From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed and be raised up on the third day.
Matthew 20 17 As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves and on the way he said to them 18 Behold we are going to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn him to death, 19 and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him and on the third day he will be raise up.
Mark 8 31 And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again.
Mark 10 33 “Behold we are going to Jerusalem
and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles. 34 They will mock Him and



197
spit on Him, and scourge Him and kill Him and three days later he will rise again.
Whilst the gospels report that these predictions were made to the disciples, something must have happened to make them common knowledge since;
Matthew 27 62 tells us.... Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief
priests and the Pharisees gather together before
Pilate, 63 and they said; “Sire we remember that when he was alive that deceiver said. ‘After three days I am to rise again.’
This implies that the information about Jesus’ forecast must
have been passed to those who claimed that they
‘remembered’ His prediction. When added to Jesus’ clear
attempt prior to the crucifixion to ensure the course of events that would take place this has all the hall marks of a set up – a series of contrived events with (presumably) a known outcome. Jesus is reported to have mentioned the resurrection when he visited Bethany at the time that he attended Lazarus;
John 11 23 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again." 24 Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day." 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,



198
A link to an Ancient Egyptian view of the last day, judgement and resurrection is well illustrated in the many coffin texts;
As for the tribunal which judges the needy, you know that they will not be lenient on that day of judging the poor; in the hour of exercising (their) function, wretched is he who is accused as a wise man. Do not put your trust in length of years, for they regard a lifetime as an hour; a man survives after death, and his deeds are laid before him in a heap. Existence yonder is eternal, and he who complains of it is a fool, but as for him who attains it, he will be like a god yonder, striding forward like the lords of eternity.133
Jesus’ words are allegorical and we cannot be sure of their meaning. However, they can be understood in the context of the Egyptian view of the afterlife and the judgement by the court of Gods that were placed behind the Ursa Major constellation (the imperishable stars that never set) in the northern sky.
Whether Jesus did or not rise from the dead, he had obviously worked hard to set down a prediction that he could fulfil.
133 Ancient Egyptian texts; The instructions of Merikare; R O Faulkner



199
Why was there such a prediction? There was nothing in the Old Testament that predicted these events and created an agenda that must be fulfilled. There are many predictions of a Messiah but none that predict the resurrection. Therefore, whether contrived or real, it did not occur in order to fulfil some ancient Hebrew prophecy.
From the clues given in the gospels, Jesus is calculated by theologians to have died on April 3rd CE 33,134 fourteen days after the vernal equinox. Traditionally, throughout all the ancient civilisations, the vernal equinox was the time of rebirth. The story of Easter as a time of rebirth, renewal and resurrection of life in general was found in the myths of many non-Christian deities such as the Greco-Phrygian god Attis and the Greco-Syrian god Adonis, among others.135 Some Christian apologists demonstrate the dying-and-rising theme overall to be sound.136
There are many Gods with similar profile aspects to Jesus Christ and these include;
o Krishna – who was crucified and resurrected
o Romulus – who was ‘snatched away to Heaven’
and who makes post mortem appearances
o Dionysus – born on December 25th and ‘hung on a
tree or crucified’
134 7 clues; Jimmy Akin 135 The Resurrection of Spring; D M Murdock, Acharya S 136 The Riddle of Resurrection, Dr. Tryggve N.D. Mettinger



200
o Zoroaster – He was killed and his followers
expected ‘a second coming’
o Attis – Born December 25th, Crucified on a tree and resurrected after three days o Horus – crucified and resurrected after three days o Osiris – slaughtered and subsequently resurrected o Odin – hanged himself for nine days and was subsequently resurrected o Tammuz/Adonis – was resurrected from the kingdom of the dead o Bel/Marduk – crucified on a hill and resurrected o Baal – Baal is announced dead and is subsequently resurrected o Heracles – was killed and was resurrected
This list and the tradition it implies does not mean that the claim that Jesus had died and been resurrected was either true or false. However, the blatant contrivances admitted in the gospels concerning this critical aspect of the life of the person being reported give cause to doubt the normal Christian interpretation. These, together with the traditions of resurrection do mean that the claims regarding the death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ are not proven. In particular, the
link to Osiris (if such a link was an imperative in Jesus’ life)
could be significant. Some quotations from the Egyptian Book of the Dead may well indicate that the link between Jesus and an incarnate God have Egyptian origins;
And I, Osiris Ani, have come into thy presence, so that I may be with thee, and may behold thy Disk every day. Let me not be kept captive [by



201
the tomb], and let me not be turned back [on my way]. Let the members of my body be made new again when I contemplate thy beauties, even as are the members of all thy favoured ones, because I am one of those who worshipped thee upon earth. Let me arrive in the Land of Eternity, let me enter into the Land of Everlastingness. This, O my Lord, behold thou shalt ordain for me.137
The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou One, who shinest from the moon. Hail, thou One, who shinest from the moon. Grant that this Osiris Ani may come forth among thy multitudes, who are at the portal. Let him be with the Light-God. Let the Tuat be opened to him. Behold, the Osiris Ani shall come forth by day to perform everything which he wisheth upon the earth among those who are living [thereon].138
As mentioned several times, we do not actually know what happened and the analysis in this chapter does not prove things one way or the other. What we do know is that our hypothesis has been strengthened not weakened and has certainly not been disproved.
137 A Hymn of Praise to Ra; The Book of the Dead; E A Wallis Budge 138 THE CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY AND OF LIVING AFTER DEATH; Ibid



202
There is one thing we can surmise with some confidence; if the hypothesis that Jesus was the son of Ptolemy XIII is accurate, Jesus would only have submitted to his captors and died (or make it look as though he had died) if the bloodline and the secret that his father had given him to protect were both secure. In other words, for our hypothesis to have foundation there would have needed to be children of Jesus living at the time of his death, or he would have needed to be alive after his reported death in order to father children. We will investigate these possibilities in a later chapter.
First we will look more closely at the so called Gnostic gospels, to see if we can discover any elements of them that might consolidate the connection to Egypt and to the Egyptian
royal bloodline in particular. From there, we will look at what
we know of Mary Magdalene, the likely bearer of Jesus’ issue.



203
Chapter 11 The Gnostic Gospels - The Nag Hammadi Scrolls
Gnosis is defined as ‘the knowledge of transcendence arrived at by way of interior, intuitive means’. It implies the
possibility of a direct relationship with the higher power that
we normally describe as ‘God’.
In the accepted Gnostic philosophy, there is a true, ultimate and glorious God, who created and is above and beyond all created universes. The basic Gnostic allegory has many variations, but all of these refer to Aeons, who are intermediate deific beings that exist between the ultimate, true god and us. They, together with this true god, comprise the
infinite realm (Pleroma) wherein the power of God operates.
One of the aeonian beings who bears the name Sophia (Ma’at
in Egypt) is of great importance to the Gnostic world view. In the course of her journeying, Sophia emanated a flawed consciousness; an entity that became the creator of the physical and spiritual whole, all of which she created in the image of her own imperfection. This being, unaware of its origins, imagined itself to be the ultimate and absolute God.
Since it took the already existing divine essence and fashioned
it into various forms, it is also called the Demiurgos or “halfmaker”. There is an genuine half, a true deific component
within creation, but it is not recognized by the half-maker or
by his/her cosmic minions, the Archons or “rulers”. Herein
lays the essence of the cosmic conflict of which we are a part.
Through time, almost all early writings that did not conform to the Christian orthodoxy came to be described as Gnostic.



204
The so called Gnostic Gospels are a collection of about 52 ancient texts based upon the teachings of several spiritual leaders, written from the 2nd to the 4th century CE. The documents which comprise this collection were not discovered at a single time, but rather as a series of finds. The Nag Hammadi Library was discovered accidentally by two farmers in December 1945 and was named after the area in Egypt where it had been hidden for centuries. An overview of these documents, many of which refer to Jesus Christ directly, is provided online by the Nag Hammadi Library, where they are described as detailed in the paragraphs below;
 Writings of creative and redemptive mythology, including Gnostic alternative versions of creation and salvation: The Apocryphon of John; The Hypostasis of the Archons; On the Origin of the World; The Apocalypse of Adam, The paraphrase of Shem.
 Observations and commentaries on diverse Gnostic themes, such as the nature of reality, the nature of the soul, the relationship of the soul to the world: The Gospel of Truth; The Treatise on the Resurrection;; The Tripartite Tractate; Eugnosis the blessed; The Second treatise of the Great Seth; The Teachings of Silvanus; The Testimony of Truth.
 Liturgical and initiatory texts: The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth; The Prayer of Thanksgiving; A Valentinian Exposition; The Three Steles of Seth; The Prayer of the Apostle Paul; (The Gospel of Philip,



205
listed under the sixth category below, has great relevance here also, for it is in effect a treatise on Gnostic sacramental theology).
 Other writings; dealing primarily with the feminine deific and spiritual principle, particularly with the Divine Sophia: The Thunder, Perfect Mind; The Thoughts of Norea; The Sophia of Jesus Christ; The Exegesis of the Soul.
 Writings pertaining to the lives and experiences of some of the apostles: The Apocalypse of Peter; The Letter of Peter to Philip; The Acts pf Peter and the Twelve Apostles; The (First) Apocalypse of James; The (second) Apocalypse of James; The Apocalypse of Paul..
 Scriptures which contain sayings of Jesus as well as descriptions of incidents in His life: The Dialogue of the Saviour; The Book of Thomas the Contender; The Apocryphon of James; The Gospel of Philip; The Gospel of Thomas.
In this chapter we will look at those scripts that seem in any way relevant to our hypothesis; that Jesus was the son of the Egyptian pharaoh, Ptolemy XIII. In each case we will extract passages from the gospels we examine and comment on them;



206
The Gospel of Truth The most significant extract from this ‘gospel’, which concerns the name of the father has already been included and discussed in the previous chapter.
The Treatise on the Resurrection This was an unorthodox interpretation of Christian teaching concerning existence after death, written (originally in Greek) between 170 and 200 CE:
How did the Lord proclaim things while he existed in flesh and after he had revealed himself as Son of God? He lived in this place where you remain, speaking about the Law of Nature - but I call it 'Death'. Now the Son of God, Rheginos (risen), was Son of Man. He embraced them both, possessing the humanity and the divinity, so that on the one hand he might vanquish death through his being Son of God, and that on the other through the Son of Man the restoration to the Pleroma (totality of divine powers) might occur; because he was originally from above, a seed of Truth, before this structure had come into being. In this many dominions and divinities came into existence.139
Jesus as the son of a divine Pharaoh is most likely to have revealed his identity and title to trusted initiates. The second part of the passage seems to refer to the Egyptian God Osiris

who had many names and aspects (divinities). The document enhances our hypothesis and does nothing to invalidate it.
The Testimony of Truth This document or codex was written between 150 and 200 CE. It was probably written by Julius Cassianus of Alexandria140 who was intent on presenting his version of the ‘the truth’ – a version of Gnostic Christianity
which contrasted with the opinions and practices of what he
saw as ‘heretical opponents.
I will speak to those who know to hear not with the ears of the body but with the ears of the mind. For many have sought after the truth and have not been able to find it; because there has taken hold of them the old leaven of the Pharisees and the scribes of the Law. And the leaven is the errant desire of the angels and the demons and the stars. As for the Pharisees and the scribes, it is they who belong to the archons who have authority over them. For no one who is under the Law will be able to look up to the truth, for they will not be able to serve two masters. For the defilement of the Law is manifest; but undefilement belongs to the light. The Law commands (one) to take a husband (or) to take a wife, and to beget, to multiply like the sand of the sea. But passion, which is a delight to them, constrains the souls of those who are begotten in this place, those
140 Ancient Gnosticism; traditions and literature; Birger A Pearson



208
who defile and those who are defiled, in order that the Law might be fulfilled through them. And they show that they are assisting the world; and they turn away from the light, who are unable to pass by the archon of darkness until they pay the last penny. But the Son of Man came forth from imperishability, being alien to defilement. He came to the world by the Jordan River, and immediately the Jordan turned back. And John bore witness to the descent of Jesus. For it is he who saw the power which came down upon the Jordan River; for he knew that the dominion of carnal procreation had come to an end. The Jordan River is the power of the body, that is, the senses of pleasures. The water of the Jordan is the desire for sexual intercourse. John is the archon of the womb
This provocative ‘testimony’ tells us that we have to read
between the lines. It could well be an allegory relating to Ptolemy XIII escaping death from drowning. In more recent times he begot Jesus and in doing so perpetuated the bloodline of the God Kings. This interpretation would have given legitimacy to the Ptolemaic claim to a power base in Egypt that had most
recently been occupied by kings whose position and offspring
were based on ‘carnal procreation’.
The Thunder, Perfect Mind This document is written as if by the God of many nations, who is male and female and who

is presented in the text in the first person singular; in many ways it expands on the Egyptian funeral texts. It could equally be a proclamation of someone who believes him/herself to be a representation of God, as did the pharaohs;
I was sent forth from the power, and I have come to those who reflect upon me, and I have been found among those who seek after me. Look upon me, you who reflect upon me, and you hearers, hear me. You who are waiting for me, take me to yourselves. And do not banish me from your sight. And do not make your voice hate me, nor your hearing. Do not be ignorant of me anywhere or any time. Be on your guard! Do not be ignorant of me. For I am the first and the last. I am the honoured one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin. I am <the mother> and the daughter. I am the members of my mother. I am the barren one and many are her sons. I am she whose wedding is great, and I have not taken a husband. I am the midwife and she who does not bear. I am the solace of my labour pains. I am the bride and the bridegroom, and it is my husband who begot me. I am the mother of my father



210
and the sister of my husband and he is my offspring. I am the slave of him who prepared me. I am the ruler of my offspring. But he is the one who begot me before the time on a birthday. And he is my offspring in (due) time, and my power is from him. I am the staff of his power in his youth, and he is the rod of my old age. And whatever he wills happens to me. I am the silence that is incomprehensible and the idea whose remembrance is frequent. I am the voice whose sound is manifold and the word whose appearance is multiple. I am the utterance of my name. Why, you who hate me, do you love me, and hate those who love me? You who deny me, confess me, and you who confess me, deny me. You who tell the truth about me, lie about me, and you who have lied about me, tell the truth about me. You who know me, be ignorant of me, and those who have not known me, let them know me. For I am knowledge and ignorance. I am shame and boldness. I am shameless; I am ashamed. I am strength and I am fear. I am war and peace. Give heed to me.



211
I am the one who is disgraced and the great one. Give heed to my poverty and my wealth. Do not be arrogant to me when I am cast out upon the earth, and you will find me in those that are to come. And do not look upon me on the dung-heap nor go and leave me cast out, and you will find me in the kingdoms. And do not look upon me when I am cast out among those who are disgraced and in the least places, nor laugh at me. And do not cast me out among those who are slain in violence. But I, I am compassionate and I am cruel. Be on your guard! Do not hate my obedience and do not love my self-control. In my weakness, do not forsake me, and do not be afraid of my power. For why do you despise my fear and curse my pride? But I am she who exists in all fears and strength in trembling. I am she who is weak, and I am well in a pleasant place. I am senseless and I am wise.

We are unsure of the context in which this document was written, who wrote it or who it was aimed at. It makes claims that are presented, as if from a single God with many aspects. We have duplicated the first half of the full text and
underlined the words that link to the Book of Revelation (I am
the first and the last) and others that tell us of the claimant’s
Egyptian connection.
The ‘one whose image is great in Egypt’ seems to refer to the
pattern or patterns that represent all the aspects of God that can be traced around the seven key stars of Ursa Major. Interestingly, a picture of the Alpha and the Omega can be traced in the same place. (Fig 17). It could of course refer to the Great Pyramid at Giza, which as we have shown earlier (Fig 4) could also be an image of a shape to be found in the same constellation. It does little to support or detract from the

214
hypothesis we propose, other than to re-enforce the Egyptian connection.
The Sophia of Jesus Christ This document (translated by Douglas M Parrott) is written by someone pondering and providing answers to fundamental questions about the nature of the Universe and of humanity. The author claims that the questions were set by the twelve disciples of Jesus and seven
women to a resurrected Jesus, which group met at ‘the
mountain of divination and joy’. Such a meeting is in part confirmed in Matthew 28, 16 which says that ‘the eleven
disciples proceed to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had
designated’. The meeting and its content, which was
summarised in Matthew, was not specifically mentioned by the other gospel writers in the New Testament. Below are several paragraphs from the Sophia;
“After he rose from the dead, his twelve
disciples and seven women continued to be his followers, and went to Galilee onto the mountain called "Divination and Joy". When they gathered together and were perplexed about the underlying reality of the universe and the plan, and the holy providence, and the power of the authorities, and about everything the Saviour is doing with them in the secret of the holy plan, the Saviour appeared - not in his previous form, but in the invisible spirit. And his likeness resembles a great angel of light. But his resemblance I must not describe. No mortal flesh could endure it, but only pure,



215
perfect flesh, like that which he taught us about on the mountain called "Of the Olives" in Galilee. And he said: "Peace be to you, My peace I give you!" And they all marvelled and were afraid. The Saviour laughed and said to them: "What are you thinking about? Are you
perplexed? What are you searching for?"
“..............The Perfect Saviour said to them: "I
want you to know that Sophia, the Mother of the Universe and the consort, desired by herself to bring these to existence without her male (consort). But by the will of the Father of the Universe, that his unimaginable goodness might be revealed, he created that curtain between the immortals and those that came afterward, that the consequence might follow ...[BG 118:]... every aeon and chaos - that the defect of the female might <appear>, and it might come about that Error would contend with her. And these became the curtain of spirit. From <the> aeons above the emanations of Light, as I have said already, a drop from Light and Spirit came down to the lower regions of Almighty in chaos, that their moulded forms might appear from that drop, for it is a judgment on him, Arch-Begetter, who is called 'Yaldabaoth'. That drop revealed their moulded forms through the breath, as a living soul. It was withered and it slumbered in the ignorance of the soul. When it became hot from the breath of the Great Light of the Male, and it took thought, (then) names



216
were received by all who are in the world of chaos, and all things that are in it through that Immortal One, when the breath blew into him. But when this came about by the will of Mother Sophia - so that Immortal Man might piece together the garments there for a judgment on the robbers - <he> then welcomed the blowing of that breath; but since he was soul-like, he was not able to take that power for himself until the number of chaos should be complete, (that
is,) when the time determined by the great angel
is complete.”142
In his supplementary commentary to the translation Parrott writes; "The notion of three divine men in the heavenly hierarchy appears to be based on Genesis 1-3 (Immortal Man = God; Son of Man = Adam [81,12]; Son of Son of Man, Saviour = Seth). Because of the presence of Seth (although unnamed in the tractate), Eugnostos must be thought of as Sethian, in some sense. However, since it is not classically Gnostic and lacks other elements of developed Sethian thought, it can only be characterized as proto-Sethian. Egyptian religious thought also appears to have influenced its picture of the super-celestial realm. The probable place of origin for Eugnostos, then, is Egypt. A very early date is suggested by the fact that Stoics, Epicureans and astrologers are called "all the philosophers." That characterization would have been appropriate in the first century BCE, but not later.
142 The Nag Hammadi Library, The Sophia (Wisdom) of Jesus Christ; translated by Douglas M Parrott



217
Eugnostos and The Sophis of Jesus Christ may have influenced the Sethian-Ophites, as described by Irenaeus. Some have proposed an influence by Eugnostos on Valentinianism. Because of the dating of Eugnostos, it would not be surprising if the text had been composed soon after the advent of Christianity in Egypt; the latter half of the first century CE. That possibility is supported by the tractate's relatively non-polemical tone."143
Had the events been exactly as described, one must assume
that Matthew’s gospel would have been less broad brush and
would have contained considerably more detail, since it the content would truly have represented enlightenment;
17 When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful. 18 And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.19 "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 20 teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."144
The author of ‘The Sophia’ (circa 50-150 CE) is believed to
have written two other Nag Hammadi documents (below)
143 Novem Testamentum, Gnosticism and Egyptian religion; Douglas M Parrott. 144 Matthew 28; 17-20



218
entitled Eugnostos the Blessed and The Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit or to have been influenced by them. All in all, the document does nothing to disprove our hypothesis, unless we believe its description of the meeting and the presentation of Jesus, literally and in detail i.e. that Jesus appeared to the gathering as a resurrected spirit. Had that been the case, we believe that more would have been made of it by orthodox Christians. It seems more likely that the author was using the drawing power of Jesus to promote his own views and that the appearance of Jesus as described is unlikely to have happened.
Eugnostos the Blessed The person Eugnostos is not known in any other context than that related to the texts found at Nag Hammadi and as we have seen above he may have had a personal agenda. In Greek, ‘eugnostos’ is an adjective composed of eu, 'good' or 'well,' and gnostos, 'known,' and so Eugnostos means 'well known,' 'familiar' (cf. Plato Lysias, frag. 17.3) or even 'easy to understand'........... Here in the title of the text, this adjective is treated as a proper name, indicating the name of the author of the tractate. The name Eugnostos also appears in another Nag Hammadi document, the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit (NHC III,2; IV,2). In the final portion of this text (the colophon or copyist's note), the author introduces himself with his two names: Eugnostos, his spiritual name, and Gongessos, his ordinary, everyday name."145 Quotations from the Eugnostos text are included blow;
145 The Nag Hammadi Scriptures; Marvin W Meyer, M Scopello



219
He-Who-Is is ineffable. No principle knew him, no authority, no subjection, nor any creature from the foundation of the world, except he alone. For he is immortal and eternal, having no birth; for everyone who has birth will perish. He is unbegotten, having no beginning; for everyone who has a beginning has an end. No one rules over him. He has no name; for whoever has a name is the creation of another. He is unnameable. He has no human form; for whoever has human form is the creation of another. He has his own semblance - not like the semblance we have received and seen, but a strange semblance that surpasses all things and is better than the totalities. It looks to every side and sees itself from itself. He is infinite; he is incomprehensible. He is ever imperishable (and) has no likeness (to anything). He is unchanging good. He is faultless. He is everlasting. He is blessed. He is unknowable, while he (nonetheless) knows himself. He is immeasurable. He is untraceable. He is perfect, having no defect. He is imperishably blessed. He is called 'Father of the Universe'. ....... Through Immortal Man appeared the first designation, namely, divinity and kingdom, for the Father, who is called 'Self-Father Man' revealed this. He created a great aeon for his own majesty. He gave him great authority, and he ruled over all creations. He created gods and



220
archangels and angels, myriads without number for retinue. .......... Now through that Man originated
divinity and kingdom. Therefore he was called
'God of gods', 'King of kings'.”
Again we can see the link with the Greek/Egyptian notion of an ineffable God and the links between this God and Man. Scopello continues her analysis and makes comment on the location of the writer; "The original Greek text of Eugnostos
the Blessed was probably composed in Egypt as early as the
end of the first century.”
The text does nothing to invalidate our hypothesis or to cast light on the true identity of Jesus.
The Apocryphon (Secret Book) of James This book was
written by several writers and assembled sometime between
100 and 150 CE. As with ‘The Sophia of Jesus Christ’ it
purports to be a pre-ascension dialogue between Jesus and his
disciples and Francis Williams tells us; “The reporting of a
special post resurrection appearance of Jesus, and the appeal to James as a source of secret and superior tradition, are means that Gnostics often used to legitimate their message."146 Several paragraphs are included below;
They all answered and said, "If you bid us, we come." He said, "Verily I say unto you, no one will ever enter the kingdom of heaven at my bidding, but (only) because you yourselves are

221
full. Leave James and Peter to me, that I may fill them." And having called these two, he drew them aside and bade the rest occupy themselves with that which they were about. ........"Therefore, trust in me, my brethren; understand what the great light is. The Father has no need of me, - for a father does not need a son, but it is the son who needs the father though I go to him. For the Father of the Son has no need of you." ........"These are the things that I shall tell you so far; now, however, I shall ascend to the place from whence I came. But you, when I was eager to go, have cast me out, and instead of accompanying me, you have pursued me. But pay heed to the glory that awaits me, and, having opened your heart, listen to the hymns that await me up in the heavens; for today I must take (my place at) the right hand of the Father. But I have said (my) last word to you, and I shall depart from you, for a chariot of spirit has borne me aloft, and from this moment on, I shall strip myself, that I may clothe myself. But give heed; blessed are they who have proclaimed the Son before his descent, that when I have come, I might ascend (again). Thrice blessed are they who were proclaimed by the Son before they came to be, that you might have a portion among them." Having said these words, he departed. But we bent (our) knee(s), I and Peter, and gave thanks,



222
and sent our heart(s) upwards to heaven. We heard with our ears, and saw with our eyes, the noise of wars, and a trumpet blare, and a great turmoil.147
Secret James can be dated to the first half of the second century, while its sources for the sayings of Jesus may go back to the first century. Ron Cameron tell us that the internal
evidence shows Egypt to be its provenance.148
The things that are described when ‘he departed’ are in the
imagination of the author. Had they been a general and
physical manifestation, the other disciples who were nearby
and occupied with ‘what they were about’ would have been
able to see and hear the drama that is described and such an
incident would have been more widely documented. This
being the case, the words are no more evidence to Jesus’ true
nature than those of a sincere and charismatic Christian teacher today.
The Gospel of Philip One translator of this ‘Gospel’ tells us; “Because of the contents, the eccentric arrangement, and the
literary types exhibited, it is likely that The Gospel of Philip is a collection of excerpts mainly from a Christian Gnostic sacramental catechesis. It explains the significance of sacramental rites of initiation, the meaning of sacred names, especially names of Jesus, and provides paraenesis for the life
147 The Nag Hammadi Library, The Apocryphon of James translated by Francis E Williams 148 Early Christian Writings on The Other Gospels, Sayings, Traditions in the Apocryphon of James by Ron Cameron



223
of the initiated. It interprets Biblical passages, particularly from the book of Genesis, makes use of typology, both historical and sacramental, and, as catechists do, argues on the basis of analogy and parable. In these and other ways The
Gospel of Philip resembles the orthodox catechisms from the
second through fourth centuries.”149
The document is thought to have been composed in Greek between 180 and 250 CE and because of that it does not have any firsthand knowledge of Jesus. We have included below, some extracts that might be relevant to the hypothesis we are investigating;
“One single name is not uttered in the world,
the name which the Father gave to the Son; it is the name above all things: the name of the Father. For the Son would not become Father unless he wore the name of the Father. Those who have this name know it, but they do not
speak it. But those who do not have it do not
know it.”
This paragraph is intriguing and on the basis of this logical construction it describes a name that can never be known to anyone except father and son. Could this refer to the fact that Ptolemy XIII was keeping his identity hidden?
"Jesus" is a hidden name, "Christ" is a revealed name. For this reason "Jesus" is not particular to any language; rather he is always called by
149 The Nag Hammadi Library in English; Wesley W Isenberg



224
the name "Jesus". While as for "Christ", in Syriac it is "Messiah", in Greek it is "Christ". Certainly all the others have it according to their own language. "The Nazarene" is he who reveals what is hidden. Christ has everything in himself, whether man, or angel, or mystery, and the Father.
How can Jesus be a hidden name? Jesus is the English form of
Ιησους (Iesous), which was the Greek form of the Aramaic
name (Yeshu'a). Yeshu'a is itself a contracted form of
Yehoshu'a, the name known in English as Joshua. Perhaps the
author meant that ‘Jesus’ was a name that hid the true identity
of the bearer.
........The apostles who were before us had these names for him: "Jesus, the Nazorean, Messiah", that is, "Jesus, the Nazorean, the Christ". The last name is "Christ", the first is "Jesus", that in the middle is "the Nazarene". "Messiah" has two meanings, both "the Christ" and "the measured". "Jesus" in Hebrew is "the redemption". "Nazara" is "the Truth". "The Nazarene" then, is "the Truth". "Christ" [...] has been measured. "The Nazarene" and "Jesus" are they who have been measured.
The author appears to be trying to justify the name of Jesus. ‘The redemption’ (in our hypothesis) could refer to redemption from persecution and the attempted elimination of



225
the bloodline. ‘Measured’ would be the attribute of something
or someone that/who fits the dimensions allocated.
Compare the bridegroom and the bride. They have come from the [...]. No Jew [...] has existed. And [...] from the Jews. [...] Christians [...] these [...] are referred to as "The chosen people of [...]," and "The true man" and "Son of Man" and "the seed of the Son of Man". This true race is renowned in the world [...] that the sons of the bridal chamber dwell.
Here we have a direct and unambiguous reference to bloodline
from Jesus and proclamation that it is ‘the true race’ and that it is ‘renowned to the world’. The author of this Gospel would
appear to have been cognisant of the importance of both the name of Jesus and of his inheritance.
“Light and Darkness, life and death, right and
left, are brothers of one another. They are inseparable. Because of this, neither are the good, good, nor evil, evil, nor is life, life, nor death, death. For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who
are exalted above the world are indissoluble,
eternal”
These claims seem to relate to the Ancient Egyptian belief that
‘the exalted’ will rise and become stars in the heavens around
the Polar constellation in the Northern sky



226
.........There is the Son of Man and there is the son of the Son of Man. The Lord is the Son of Man, and the son of the Son of Man is he who creates through the Son of Man. The Son of Man received from God the capacity to create. He also has the ability to beget. He who has received the ability to create is a creature. He who has received the ability to beget is an offspring. He who creates cannot beget. He who begets also has power to create. Now they say, "He who creates begets". But his so-called "offspring" is merely a creature. Because of [...] of birth, they are not his offspring but [...]. He who creates works openly, and he himself is visible. He who begets, begets in private, and he himself is hidden, since [...] image. Also, he
who creates, creates openly. But one who
begets, begets children in private.”150
This paragraph tells us that the name is known but that it is kept secret and that the Son of (a) Man is a human creature,
who was begotten by the normal rules of pro-creation and has
‘the ability to beget’. Presumably this human ability to ‘beget in private’ was important and could refer to Jesus’ role in the
perpetuation of the bloodline. The ‘Son of (a) Man’ in this
paragraph would be Ptolemy XIII and Jesus would fulfil the
role of ‘the son of the Son of (a) Man.
150 The Nag Hammadi Library, The Gospel of Philip; translated by Wesley W. Isenberg



227
The Gospel of Philip is a long document and because of that
we have extracted paragraphs that may be pertinent to our
research. All in all, the ‘gospel’ says nothing that would
invalidate our hypothesis and says much that would validate it. There are some additional paragraphs that refer to Mary Magdalene and these will be covered in a later chapter.
The Gospel of Thomas This ‘Gospel’ is a collection of
sayings, anecdotes and parables that are written as the words of Jesus. It is believed to have been compiled from a collection of Greek and Coptic fragments (which vary in content). The Coptic compilation was written circa 350 CE but the individual fragments were probably written nearer 200 CE based on an earlier oral tradition. The only verses that add to our analysis of Jesus identity and purpose are;
(113) His disciples said to him, "When is the kingdom going to come?" <Jesus said>, "It is not by being waited for that it is going to come. They are not going to say, 'Here it is' or 'There it is.' Rather, the kingdom of the father is spread out over the earth, and people do not see it."151
(114) Simon Peter said to them: Let Mariham go out from among us, for women are not worthy of the life. Jesus said: Look, I will lead her that I may make her male, in order that she too may become a living spirit resembling you
151 The Gnostic Scriptures, translation of the Gospel of Thomas by Bentley Layton



228
males. For every woman who makes herself male will enter into the kingdom of heaven."152
The first verse (113) refers to a kingdom ‘of the father’ spread
out over the earth. The earth at this time would have implied
the ‘known world’ and this could well have referred to the
Egyptian kingdom, which would have still had tenure in the mind of the last remaining pharaoh, Ptolemy XIII. An analysis of the second verse is included in the chapter on
Mary Magdalene (Chapter 15). It is perhaps worth noting here
that the Egyptian ‘Kingdom of Heaven’ was in the stars that
surrounded the constellation of Ursa Major and was populated
by stars that were pharaohs or ‘sons of God’. Could it be that
the comment attributed to Jesus was based on his belief that she would join the great and the good in the stars of the northern sky?
The Nag Hammadi Scrolls indicate that intellectuals and
religious philosophers, who were mainly based in Alexandria,
were keen to advocate their view of each individual’s way of
connecting with/to an incarnate and unassailable God, who was creator of all things visible and invisible. The authors of these scrolls either piggy backed on the life and sayings of a
person who they believed would become a popular legend in
their time or they reflected knowledge of Jesus’ true identity.
We are investigating whether this person could have been
someone whose purpose was to perpetuate the Pharaonic
bloodline and (perhaps) re-establish the ‘Kingdom of God’
152 The Gospel of Thomas translated by Beate Blatz



229
over the known world. If he was the son of Ptolemy XIII he would have believed that he had a vital role in that connection. His claims were carefully phrased but it is possible that they were interpreted in different ways by those hearing (of) them. Some came to interpret them as the claims of an incarnate divine individual who was an aspect (son) of God Eternal. This may even have been the result of Jesus himself believing that his inheritance gave him a claim to divinity as a direct descendent of Osiris and that he would be raised to join him at his ascension. Others may well have seen them as the rightful assertions of the claimant to the Pharaonic throne and to all that that entailed. Whatever the truth of it, there is nothing in the Nag Hammadi Scrolls, which invalids out hypothesis.

Chapter 12 Other texts and codices
The Dead Sea Scrolls This is a collection of some 981 different texts discovered between 1946 and 1956 in eleven caves from the immediate vicinity of the ancient settlement at Khirbet Qumran in the West Bank. The caves are located about 2 kilometres inland from the northwest shore of the Dead Sea, from which they derive their name. The parchments and the ink on them has been dated to between 385 BCE and 33 CE, the early part of which they would have been under the influences of the philosophical thinking of Israel, Rome, Greece and Egypt. The view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the "Qumran–Essene" hypothesis originally proposed by Roland Guérin de Vaux and Józef Tadeusz Milik, though independently both Eliezer Sukenik and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran. The Qumran–Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at Khirbet Qumran. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the Jewish Revolt sometime between 66 and 68 CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered. A number of arguments are used to support this theory:
 There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the Community Rule and descriptions of the Essene initiation



231
ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius Josephus – a Jewish–Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.  Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.  During the excavation of Khirbet Qumran, two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done
there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. De Vaux
called this area the “scriptorium” based upon this
discovery.  Several Jewish ritual baths (Hebrew: miqvah = מקוה ) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant Jewish presence at the site.  Pliny the Elder (a geographer writing after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE) describes a group of Essenes living
in a desert community on the northwest shore of the Dead
Sea near the ruined town of ‘Ein Gedi.
The Essenes and some early Christians espoused a pious, ascetic life, deserting the city and the secular world for a life of solitary or communal prayer and self-denial but the Essenes
were not a Christian group. Their writings make no mention
of John the Baptist, Jesus, or Jesus’ followers (by name). The
Dead Sea Scrolls reveal, if anything, that Christianity was not a unique spiritual and religious phenomenon, but had much in
common with the Essenes who mention in some detail a
religious leader named ‘The Teacher of righteousness’. Some
elements of these texts are duplicated below that we believe might help with our analysis. In addition, we include appropriate sections of the Essene codices mentioned above.



232
Another text worthy of mention is The Gospel of Mary which was found in the Berlin Gnostic Codex (Papyrus Berolinensis 8502). This very important and well-preserved codex was apparently discovered in the late-nineteenth century somewhere near Akhmim in Upper Egypt. It was purchased in 1896 by a German scholar, Dr. Carl Reinhardt, in Cairo and then taken to Berlin. This text will be discussed in chapter 15 dedicated to Mary Magdalene.
The Divine Throne Chariot This text draws its inspiration from Ezekiel (1:10) and is related to the Book of Revelation. It depicts the appearance and movement of the Merkabah, the divine Chariot supported and drawn by the cherubim, which is at the same time a throne and a vehicle. The "small voice" of blessing is drawn from Kings 1 19:12: it was in a "still small voice" that God manifested himself to Elijah.153 In Ancient Egypt, this primal pattern was called the Mer-Ka-Ba. It was actually three words, not one. Mer meant a kind of light that rotated within itself. Ka meant spirit, in this case referring to the human spirit. And Ba meant the human body — though it also could mean the concept of Reality that spirit holds. And so the entire word in ancient Egypt referred to a rotating light that would take the spirit and the body from one world into another.154

233
before him, and the cherubim utter blessings. And as they rise up, there is a divine small voice and loud praise; there is a divine small voice as they fold their wings. The cherubim bless the image of the ThroneChariot above the firmament, and they praise the majesty of the fiery firmament beneath the seat of his glory. And between the turning wheels, angels of holiness come and go, as it were a fiery vision of most holy spirits; and about them flow seeming rivulets of fire, like gleaming bronze, a radiance of many gorgeous colours, of marvellous pigments magnificently mingled. The Spirits of the Living God move perpetually with the glory of the wonderful Chariot. The small voice of blessing accompanies the tumult as they depart, and on the path of their return they worship the Holy One, Ascending they rise marvellously; settling, they stay still. The sound of joyful praise is silenced and there is a small voice of blessing in all the camp of God. And a voice of praise resounds from the midst of all their divisions in worship. And each one in his place, all their numbered ones sing hymns of praise.
This passage creates a direct link to the constellation of Ursa
Major, (known as ‘the chariot’ in some philosophies) the
throne which houses the God of Egypt in all his/her aspects.



234
“Not only useful in the physical realm, its connection to the
sun might indicate that, in the afterlife, the chariot aided the transformation of the king from the mortal plane to the divine. While he lived, the king became the dazzling sun-disc in his
chariot, showing his association with Ra. Even more telling is
that the chariot was considered to be the ‘earthly counterpart of the solar bark’”155
It adds little to our research into the true identity of Jesus Christ but shows that the Essenes, with whom Jesus was thought to have been associated retained many of the central concepts of the Egyptian religion.
The Great Isaiah scroll This Scroll (1QIsaa) is one of the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in Qumran in 1947. It is the largest (734 cm) and best preserved of all the biblical scrolls, and the only one that is almost complete. It is dated circa 125 BCE. The 54 columns contain all 66 chapters of the Hebrew version of the biblical Book of Isaiah. We have selected extracts which illustrate the links between the thinking of the author and the Egyptian religious tradition.
Chapter 7 - (14) therefore [the Lord] himself will give to you {a sign} {Behold} the virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and he shall call his name Immanuel (God is with us)
This text was discussed earlier in Chapter 8. It has been used extensively by Christian theologians to support their assertions regarding the virgin birth of Jesus.

235
Chapter 9 (5) Because a child shall be born to us and a son is given to us and the government shall be upon his shoulders and he shall be called wonderful, counsellor, mighty God, everlasting father the prince of peace. (6) Of the increase of his government and his peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and over his kingdom to order it and to establish it in judgement and in righteousness from and until eternity; The zeal of YHWH of Hosts will perform this.
This extract illustrates that a Royal bloodline of which David is a link between its beginning and its continuance was an important and established concept.
Chapter 22 - And it will be in that day that I will call to my servant to Eliakim, son of Hilkiah (21) And I will cause him to be dressed in your tunic and will strengthen him with your girdle and I will give your government into his hand and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. (22) And I will give him the key of the house of David upon his shoulder and he will open and no one shall shut and shut and no one will open. (23) And I will drive him as a nail in an established place and he shall be for a throne of glory for his father's house. (24) And they shall hang upon him all the glory of the house of his father, and all the offspring.



236
Again we see confirmation of the importance of the offspring of the house of David – who (as we have previously discussed) could well have been the pharaoh Thutmose III.
Chapter 57 14 And he shall say, Cast up, cast up, [the thing cast up] prepare the way, raise up the stumbling block from the way of my people. 15 because thus says the Father of exaltation and the lifted up One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; He inhabits the high and holy place, with the contrite and lowly spirit, to make alive the spirit of the lowly, and to make alive the heart of the contrite.
The words ‘he inhabits the high and holy place’ seem to be a
direct reference to the area around Ursa Major, classified as Heaven by the Egyptians. The text itself is similar to many found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead; I open the door in heaven. I rule my throne. I open the way for the births which take place on this day. I am the child who traverseth the road of Yesterday. I am To-day for untold nations and peoples. I am he who protecteth you for millions of years. Whether ye be denizens of heaven, or of the earth, or of the South, or of the North, or of the East, or of the West, the fear of me is in your bodies. I am he whose being hath been wrought in his eye. I shall not die again. My moment is in your bodies, but my



237
forms are in my place of habitation. I am "He who cannot be known."156
Despite the efforts of Moses and those that came after him to present God as someone different from the gods that had gone before, we see above the enduring close link between the Hebrew and Egyptian views of God and Heaven.
Chapter 59 20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to those who repent of transgression in Jacob, says YHWH. 21 And I, [m..As for me] this is my covenant with them, says YHWH; My spirit that is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, from now and forever.
The word ‘redeemer’ in the Hebrew rabbinical tradition generally denotes a person who as the nearest relative of
another and is charged with the duty of restoring the rights of
another and avenging his wrongs. It can also mean ‘saviour’ or ‘restorer’. This is not a prophecy about Jesus. We know that it refers to ‘God’ and redemption from Jerusalem’s then current
state of iniquity as is shown in chapter 52 of this scroll which tells us; “Break out, sing together, waste places of Jerusalem:
156 The Book of the Dead, The Papyrus of Ani, The Chapter of driving back the slaughters which are performed in Hensu; translated by E A Wallis Budge



238
because YHWH has comforted his people, he has redeemed
Jerusalem”.
Chapter 63 17 why YHWH have you made us to wander from your ways, and hardened our heart from your fear? Restore for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance. 18 The people of your holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary. 19 We are yours: from antiquity you never bore rule over them; they were not called by your name
This extract seems to infer that the emergence of the Hebrew religious tradition was new and that in antiquity their allegiance was to different beliefs and practices. This reinforces the view that there was a close and inherited link between the Egyptian and the Hebrew religious traditions.
Our examination of the Isaiah Scroll has only confirmed the fact that the Hebrew religion grew out of the Egyptian religious tradition. It does nothing to confirm the identity of Jesus Christ and only provides evidence of the background into which he was born.
The Pesher to Habakkuk This commentary consist of many
fragments and talks about ‘The Teacher of Righteousness’
who some believe might have been Jesus. We include a single
extract which might be an oblique reference to Jesus’ identity.
The translation by Fred P Miller uses bold print for the actual
text and the other parts are ‘commentary’. He does not believe



239
this text refers to Jesus Christ or to Christians in any way and
believes that over the years, Christians have made this claim to
“discredit Caparnaum and his followers”.
1. you have set them for judgement O Rock, you have established them for correction. (You have) purer eyes( parts of 1:12 and 13) 2. than to view evil and you are not able to consider wickedness (part of 1:13) 3. Pesher about the saying that God is not able to (to save) his people from the hand of the Gentiles 4. and God gives judgement in the hand of his "Chosen one" (to) all the Gentiles and in their reproaches 5. and their guilt to all those doing evil to my people which keep my commandments.
If this text did refer to Jesus, the term ‘chosen one’ could add
weight to our hypothesis, particularly in the context of finding and selecting the right person to be his mother.
Pistis Sophia This text contains 148 chapters and was probably written between the 3rd and 4th centuries CE. The author is unknown but researchers believe that it was probably constructed in Egypt.
It is a comprehensive Gnostic document covering aspects of
the life of Jesus, almost every facet of existence and man’s
relationship with God. Specifically, it claims that Jesus



240
remained with his disciples for eleven years after his reported death. We have included extracts which we believe might throw some light of the Jesus identity.
Chapters 2-5 describe ‘the transfiguration’ in terms that are
similar to a hallucinogenic experience. This narrative was complied many years after the reported event and is most likely a tailored aggrandisement of the transfiguration as
reported in Matthew 17, Mark 9 and Luke 9.
Chapter 6 Jesus admits that he was sent ‘for a ministry’, which
the author then shrouds in Gnostic embellishment (chapters 7 and 8) in order to portray Jesus as a divine, supernatural being.
Chapters 10-16 develop the Gnostic theme by describing the
‘third vesture’ in terms of ‘the glory of the name of the mystery of all orders of the emanations’ and Jesus interaction
with them. In chapter 18 Mary speaks openly and says;
..... concerning this word then, my Lord, the power which was in the prophet Isaiah, hath spoken thus and proclaimed afore time in a spiritual similitude, discoursing on the 'Vision about Egypt': 'Where then, O Egypt, where are thy consulters and horoscope-casters and those who cry out of the earth and those who cry out
of their belly? Let them then declare unto thee
from now on the deeds which the lord Sabaōth
will do!' ........... none of the rulers will know what thou wilt do from now on,--for they are 'Egypt,' because they are matter



241
This provides us with a direct and unequivocal link to Egypt. Chapters 19 – 86 unfold the Mystery of Light, the Seven Voices, seven Amen, Five Trees, seven virgins and their fifteen helpers and all their aspects and access to each aspect. In chapter 96 Jesus says;
But Mary Magdalene and John, the Virgin, will tower over all my disciples and over all men who shall receive the mysteries in the Ineffable. And they will be on my right and on my left. And I am they, and they are I
If Jesus is basing his announcement on the mysteries he has learned from his father and he believes that he himself will join the Ineffable in the form of Osiris, then this verse would seem to indicate that John the Virgin is the eldest son of Jesus who will later inherit his claim to the divine title. This title will be that attributed the next legitimate Pharaoh (after Jesus)
and that Mary will be acknowledged as his wife and as ‘wife
of the king’. This perspective appears to be confirmed in
chapter 97 which goes on to say;
"He, therefore, who shall receive the [first] mystery of that First Mystery, and it shall be at the time that he cometh out of the body of the matter of the rulers,--then the retributive
receivers come and lead the soul of that man
out of the body.”



242
Chapter 99 describes how long is; ‘a year of light’. In the
description it calculates a year as being 365 days. This would seem to indicate that Jesus was talking in terms of an Egyptian year since a Hebrew year could be 353, 354, 355, 383, 384 or 385 days long. Another oblique reference to Egyptian belief occurs in chapter 110 where the disciples say;
“Now, therefore, because of these great deeds
of which thou tellest us, our souls have become frenzied and they have pressed very exceedingly, yearning to go forth out of us on high to the region of thy kingdom."
Chapter 121 makes direct reference to kings of the earth;
"If to-day a king who is a man of the world, giveth a gift to men of his like, and also forgiveth murderers and those who have intercourse with males, and the rest of the very grievous sins which are deserving of death,--if it becometh him who is a man of the world, to have done this, much more then have the Ineffable and the First Mystery, who are the lords of the universe, the authority to act in all
things as it pleaseth them, that they forgive
everyone who shall receive mysteries.”
Whilst there is a question mark over these being the actual words of Jesus, they may explain how, as someone who



243
believed himself to be a king, with a divine inheritance he had the power to forgive sins. (Luke 7;48, Mark 2;5, Matthew 9;2)
Chapter 131 gives a clear indication that ‘the dragon’ is a
pattern in the stars and not some spirit being. In giving this explanation the author gives another clue to the Egyptian connection;
The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "When the light of the sun is outside [? above the world], he covereth the darkness of the dragon; but if the sun is below the world, then the darkness of the dragon abideth as veiling of the sun and the breath of the darkness cometh into the world in form of a smoke in the night,-that is, if the sun withdraweth into himself his rays, then indeed the world is not able to endure the darkness of the dragon in its true form; otherwise would it be dissolved and go to ruin withal."
In other words; when the sun is up you cannot see it and when the sun has set you can.
Chapters 136 to 148 refer to a time after Jesus’ claimed
resurrection. They consist of Jesus talking about the afterlife, the powers there and the chastisement of sinners. These chapters include reference to the 12 houses of Astrology and to the names of Greek Gods such as Zeus, Kronos, Ares, Aphrodite and Hermes. In several chapters he names the father of his father (his grandfather) as ‘Yew’. We are told of Yew;



244
The Yew, Taxus baccata, is an ancient tree species that has survived since before the Ice Age and as such as been revered and used by humankind throughout the ages and some are believed to be 4000 years old. The Yew is sacred to Hecate, and the Crone aspect of the Triple Goddess; both are guardians of the Underworld, death and the afterlife. The Yew is considered to be the most potent tree for protection against evil, a means of connecting to your ancestors, a bringer of dreams and otherworld journeys and a symbol of the old magic.157
Ptolemy XIII’s father was Ptolemy XII Auletes, otherwise
known as Ptolemy Neos Dionysus Theos. When we examine these names it is possible to find an interesting connection; Dionysus (sometimes known as Bacchus) was the Olympian
God of wine, vegetation and pleasure and festivity and Virgil
tells us; “he loves open hills and the yew tree”. In Greek
mythology he is a god of foreign origin, and while Mount Nysa is a mythological location, it is invariably set far away to the east or to the south. The Homeric Hymn to Dionysus places it "far from Phoenicia, near to the Egyptian stream". It is likely (in the hypothesis we propose) that real names were not used by Ptolemy XIII and/or Jesus, for reasons of secrecy. Because of that, they could well have resorted to the use of
157 The Yew, Sacred Tree of Transformation and Rebirth; Glennie Kindred



245
‘nick names’. Could the name ‘Yew’ for Jesus grandfather be
a record of the actual nickname used by Jesus and thus provide us with a link between Jesus and his grandfather Ptolemy XII?
This document presents Jesus as someone who is claiming to have knowledge of God and the many aspects of God. The words, if they are represented as they were spoken could well have been those of someone who sincerely believed his divine (Egyptian) inheritance and who had been taught the intricacies
of a theology he was to champion in his role as legitimate
King and ‘Son of God’. Looked at from this perspective, there
is nothing in this text that would invalidate our hypothesis and much to promote it.
The Bruce Codex This comprises Coptic, Arabic and Ethiopic manuscripts. It originally contained 78 papyrus leaves making up two separate manuscripts, the Book of Jeu and the Untitled Text.
The First Book of Ieou The Books of IEOU probably represent notes attached initiation rituals and meditation directed towards producing altered states of spiritual consciousness. They are very much in the Gnostic tradition of the time and like Pistis Sophia they give Jesus commentary of the Plemora, the light, the emanations, the treasuries.... The text below is extracted from The Books of JEU and the Untitled text in the Bruce Codex translated by Carl Schmidt.
The living Jesus said again : "When you become heavenly you will become the Midst



246
because it is nothing, for the .. . .. rulers and the wicked powers (exousiai) will you and they will envy you because you have known me, because I am not from the world, and I do not resemble the rulers and the powers (exousiai) and all the wicked ones. They do not come from me. And furthermore he who (is born) in the flesh of unrighteousness has no part in the Kingdom of my Father, and also he who me ....... according to the flesh has no hope .... Kingdom of God the Father."
Like other Gnostic texts, it was written a long time after Jesus ministry. It appears to be telling us that Jesus believed himself to be different because his genealogy was true and that it was the envy of earthly rulers.
The Untitled Text in the Bruce codex
The text discusses the All-Father, The All-Mother and The
Only Begotten Son. It is likely that this treatise; “was
dependent upon a document attributed to Nicotheos, which in turn seems to have depended at least in part upon the first part
of Marsanes that summarises the doctrine of the [paternal
‘perfect invisible triple-powered one’ noted by Nicotheos”.158
Extracts included here provide no proof of Jesus identity but may provide good background material;
158 Sethian Gnosticism and the Platonic tradition; John Douglas Turner



247
7 This is the mother-city of the only-begotten one. This is the only-begotten of whom Phosilampes spoke : "He exists before the All" It is he who came forth from the endless, characterless, patternless and self-begotten aeon who has begotten himself, who came forth from the ineffable and immeasurable one, who exists verily and truly. It is he, in whom exists the truly existent one; that is to say, the incomprehensible Father exists in his onlybegotten Son. The All rests in the ineffable and unutterable, unruled and untroubled one, of whose godhood which is itself no godhood, no one is able to speak. And when Phosilampes understood, he said: "Those things which verily and truly exist and those which do not exist are for his sake. This is he, for whose sake, are those that truly exist which are secret, and those that do not truly exist which are manifest."
The extract could well have been referring to the God and Son as they would have been thought of by priests and initiates of the Ancient Egyptian religion in the persons of Ra and Osiris.
15 And I will give to them the mystery of my hidden Father because they have loved what is theirs, and they have fled from him who persecutes them with violence".



248
This verse could equally refer to Jesus earthly father, whose
true identity was kept hidden and who ‘fled’ and hid from
persecution..
The Gnostic texts we have quoted all perpetuated the same theme: Reading them without bias or commitment to any point of view, it is easy to see that Jesus may well have been trying to explain what he believed to be the essential nature of the ancient Egyptian Religion.
The Greek Ptolemaic regime that took the crown of Egypt had a yen to re-establish the essence of this Egyptian Religion, which they and others had caused to be diluted. Their efforts started with Ptolemy I who compiled the Egyptian history (via Manetho) entitled Aegyptika and completed in 271 BCE. This work did much to consolidate the Ptolemaic desire for a return to the ancient traditions and for a continuous and pure bloodline. It traced the king back to the Gods and God Kings (including Osiris) who they believed ruled Egypt prior to the dynastic kings. This history was written at a time when the Egyptians
themselves seemed to have lost direction. We are told by
historians; “The Egyptians themselves, according to Greek
writers, looked back to a time when their initiated priesthood was in possession of greater wisdom than was theirs in later
times; they confess that they had fallen away from this high
standard and had lost the key to much of their knowledge.”159
Over 3000 years the Egyptian religious believes evolved. In the later periods this evolution was affected by the impact of
159 Fragments of faith Forgotten; G R S Mead



249
Persian and Hellenistic cultures and beliefs, which conflicted
with the oral traditions that clung to the ‘old religion’.
Evidence of this is seen in the diversity of hieroglyphic signs for the same person – there were 73 signs for the name of Osiris. During the Ptolemaic dynasty Egyptian mysteries" (of Osiris and Isis) were brought into the public arena – illustrating the wonder that the Ptolemies found in the ancient beliefs and the fact that they wished to open them up to the Egyptian people and (thereby) bring them back to their sacred roots. Festival re-enactments of sacred stories took place, involving the death, rebirth and an initiatic vision of the "midnight sun" as shown in many the Egyptian texts that spoke of the Netherworld. The Greek/Hellenistic influence accounts for Thoth being renamed or conjoined with Hermes. Thoth played a part in many of the myths of Pharaonic Egypt: he played a role in the creation myth, he was recorder of the gods, and he was the principal pleader for the soul at the judgment of the dead. It was he who invented writing. He wrote all the ancient texts, including the most esoteric ones, including The Book of Breathings, which taught humans how to become gods. He was connected with the moon and thus was considered ruler of the night. Thoth was also the teacher and helper of the ancient Egyptian trinity of Isis, Osiris, and Horus; it was under his instructions that Isis worked her sacred love magic whereby she brought the slain Osiris back to life. It is thought by some researchers that the Hermetic philosophy of a single god hidden in the multiplicity of things, whose name was secret, was given prominence in the Ramesside period (1290-1070 BCE), and may well have gained



250
momentum earlier during the heretical rule of Akhenaton, thus
commencing the influence of an Egyptian "hermetic"
philosophy into later European and Jewish thinking.”160
Ptolemy XIII’s father was Ptolemy XII who would have been
available to influence the thinking of his son during his second reign, between 55 and 51 BCE. At this time Ptolemy XIII was between 7 and 12 years old. With the blessing of Rome, Ptolemy XII chose Cleopatra as his co-regent during his final years. His final legacy was the beginning of family in-fighting when he declared that he wanted his daughter Cleopatra VII and his son Ptolemy XIII to rule together. We are told by researchers; “Throughout his long-lasting reign the principal aim of Ptolemy was to secure his hold on the Egyptian throne so as to eventually pass it to his heirs. To achieve this goal he was prepared to sacrifice much: the loss of rich Ptolemaic lands, most of his wealth and even, according to Cicero, the very dignity on which the mystique of kingship rested when he appeared before the Roman people as a mere supplicant.”161
If it is true that Ptolemy XIII managed to evade execution by
Mark Antony’s death squad he would have had some 35 years
to contemplate his circumstance before he eventually sired Jesus. He would then have had a further 30 years to ensure that his now valuable son was indoctrinated with the essential elements of the religion he believed in. Interestingly, the
160 Review of The Secret Lore of Egypt; Its impact on The West by Erik Hornung; review by Lee Irwin 161 Ptolemy and the Romans; Mary Siani-Davies



251
gospels give us a clue to Jesus intent in this regard when he spoke to his disciples in Caesarea;
And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.162
The Greek word ἐκκλησίαν from the original texts has conventionally been translated as ‘church’. It can also mean; ‘assembly’, ‘gathering of people in a public place for deliberation’, ‘a throng of men assembled by chance’ or ‘those in a community who are united into one body’. It does not mean ‘religion’! Its use therefore implies that the religion existed and had been already established and that Peter’s job
was to be the hub of its propagation.
All in all the various Gnostic texts do nothing to disprove our hypothesis. If anything they enhance the idea that the words of
Jesus, which, if accurately reported were to propose his view
of what ‘God’, ‘the All’ and the ‘Heavenly Host’ entailed.
It is possible that his views were an up-to-date revelation of the Egyptian Religion and the Egyptian Mysteries as taught to him by his father and the priests with whom his father would have been associated. In this scenario it is likely that they would have been expressed to prepare the ground for an eventual re-establishment of the kingdom of Osiris (God) on earth.
162 Matthew 16; 18



252
Chapter 13 The Epistles
Epistles in the new Testament
An epistle is usually a stylish and formal instructive letter. The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in Ancient Egypt as part of the scribal-school writing curriculum. The letters in the New Testament from The Apostles to Christians are usually referred to as The Epistles. Those letters traditionally attributed to Paul are known as Pauline Epistles and the others as Catholic Epistles. The cannon of the New Testament includes; the Four Canonical Gospels, The Acts of The Apostles, The Epistles or letters of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation. The books of the canon of the New Testament were thought to have been written mostly in the first century and finished by the year 150 CE. For the Orthodox, the recognition of these writings as authoritative was formalized in the Second Council of Trullan
of 692, although it was almost universally accepted in the mid
300’s.
If our hypothesis is correct then Jesus or his children were alive at the stage these letters were written. For that reason we examined them for any evidence of this and for any clues to our general hypothesis concerning Jesus identity. Any such evidence is difficult to find since generally, the letters reenforce the messages in the Gospels concerning Jesus and the message each author believes Jesus to have given. Any change of emphasis relates to the implementation of the message and the dangers to those who transgress. This is unsurprising as thirteen of the Twenty One Epistles of the New Testament are



253
attributed to Paul, who was not a disciple and who had acquired all his information second hand. Like most coverts he was a fanatic.
Below, we include some extracts from the Acts of the Apostles and the canonical epistles that may be useful to our examination and start with a quotation from Acts 2;
Acts 2 16-17 But this is what was spoken of
through the prophet Joel; ‘And it shall be in the last days’, God says, ‘that I will pour forth of
my spirit on all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, and your young
men shall see visions, and your old men dream
dreams’
This prophecy of God’s view of ‘the last’ days is mirrored by
the view of the supplicant portrayed in The Papyrus of Ani known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead;
Appendix from the Papyrus of Nebseni,
and let them see the Great God in the shrine on the day of the counting of souls, and let them hold converse with Osiris, whose habitations are hidden, and those who guard the members of Osiris, and who keep ward over the Spiritsouls, and who hold captive the shadows of the dead, and who would work evil against me, so that they shall [not] work evil against me. A way shall be for KA with thee, and thy soul shall be prepared by those who keep ward over



254
the members of Osiris, and who hold captive the shadows of the dead.
Once more we see that elements of the Egyptian belief system have carried through into the thoughts of the founders of Christianity. The prophet Joel lived circa 950 BCE when there was a strong and growing Hebrew community in Northern Egypt.
Some extracts from the Acts and the Epistles which seem to be
worthy of note are those that mention ‘John who was called Mark’. The wording seems to indicate that there a person in
the group who was named John, who for seem reason unstated was known as Mark. It also states that he was the son of Mary. It does not say which Mary but if it is Mary the Mother of
Jesus, then this person would be Jesus brother and if it is Mary
Magdalene it could be Jesus’ son;
Acts 12 12 And when he (Peter) realised this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying......... 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark.
This person is mentioned again in Acts 15;
Acts 15 36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren



255
in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are." ........ 37 Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. ........ 38 But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work ....... 39 And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus
The verses imply that ‘John named Mark’ was young and
needed guardianship. There has been much speculation concerning the identity of this person and some believe that he is same Mark the Cousin of Barnabas mentioned by Paul (Col 4;10) and (2 Tim 4;11):
10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and also Barnabas's cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him) 11 Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service
It is proposed by some that this John/Mark is John the
beloved, who is mentioned six times in John’s Gospel and
who is proposed by Christian theologians to be John the
Evangelist, writer of John’s gospel.
This uncertainty inclined us to take another look at the
mentions of John in John’s gospel and in particular at the references to ‘the one who Jesus loved’:



256
In the original Greek, verse 19; 26 of John’s gospels is
written;
Ἰησοῦς οὖν ἰδὼν τὴν μητέρα καὶ τὸν μαθητὴν παρεστῶτα ὃν ἠγάπα, λέγει τῇμητρί, Γύναι, ἴδε ὁ υἱός σου.
This translates to; Jesus then saw the mother and the pupil/disciple standing beside/present/at hand who/that he
loved dearly, he said to the mother, woman/wife
‘lo/behold/look the son of you.’
Most translations of this text say that Jesus saw HIS mother. It does not! If it was meant to refer to his mother it would have probably been written conventionally as; τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ the mother of him.
Thus, if we use the correct translation, we can see that it is possible that the reported words of Jesus were directed at
Mary Magdalene and to the disciple whom Jesus loved. In
other words, ‘the disciple who Jesus loved’ could have been his own son. If this is so, the son’s identity would most likely
have been protected. Assuming that John/Mark is the same person as John the beloved, this in turn might account for the use of the pseudonym of Mark, as mentioned in the extracts from the Acts of the Apostles above.
The Epistles of John are attributed to John the Evangelist, traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John. The first Epistle was probably written in Ephesus between the years 95–110 CE and contains some verses of interest, when compared with Egyptian texts;



257
1 john 1 5 His is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
Book of the Dead MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE GOD WHO LIGHTENETH THE DARKNESS. The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the girdle of the garment of the god Nu, which giveth light, and shineth, and belongeth to his breast, the illuminer of the darkness, the uniter of the two Rehti deities, the dweller in my body, through the great spell of the words of my mouth........... I am Hem-Nu, the lightener of the darkness. I have come to lighten the darkness; it is light. I have lightened the darkness. I have overthrown the ashmiufiends. I have sung hymns to those who dwell in the darkness. I have made to stand up the weeping ones, whose faces were covered over; they were in a helpless state of misery. Look ye then upon me. I am Hem-Nu. I will not let you hear concerning it. [I have fought. I am HemNu. I have lightened the darkness. I have come. I have made an end to the darkness which hath become light indeed.
The ancient Egyptian beliefs were probably literal, in that they believed that the light from God referred to the light from the sun eliminating and overcoming the darkness of the night on a



258
daily basis. There is a possibility that ‘light’ in John’s Epistle
was meant in a more ethereal or spiritual sense but there is no doubt that the concept of God being light was one that was inherited by the Christians from an earlier Egyptian belief.
Another significant text occurs in John’s second epistle which he directs at ‘the chosen lady’ – this word ‘lady’ (κυρία)
seems to be a form of address, both here and in 2 John 1:5. At that time it was not usual to apply the title of lady to any but the Roman empress. Some theologians have suggested that it is proper name, which is unlikely, and others that it is directed towards Mary the mother of Jesus. If Jesus had a family, there is also the possibility that it was directed at the mother of Jesus children, who (in our hypothesis) might have been thought of as a queen.
2 john 1 1 The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth, ............. (5) Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another .......... (9) Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. ............... (12) Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your joy may



259
be made full (13) The children of your chosen sister greet you.
Looked at from the perspective of the hypothesis we are
proposing, phrases like ‘the chosen lady and her children’ and ‘all who know truth’ conjures a picture of a special family and
some secret, known only to a select few. Verse 12 intimates that there is something special and joyous that John wants to
communicate to the lady in question. The words would imply
some news of this the lady’s son and might explain why John
was reticent to expose the son or himself by expressing this news in writing.
The only other extract from the New Testament Epistles that is of interest is in the Epistle to the Hebrews. The author of this Epistle is unknown and has been suggested to be Paul and/or Priscilla who was Jewess and a prominent Christian evangelist who had been expelled from Rome.
Hebrews 1 (4) (God’s Son) ..... having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they (5) For to which of the angels did He ever say, "You are my son, today I have begotten you"? And again, "I will be father to him and he will be son to me"?
In this text, we see that ‘The Son’ being spoken to, inherited his name, which was ‘more excellent’ than the names of ‘the
angels. The word inherited implies that it was the possession of the father before being inherited by the son. This is



260
significant because early Christian tradition there was never a
suggestion that ‘The Father’ had at some time previously been ‘The Son’. In the Egyptian tradition the only way that a ‘Son of God’ could inherit this, the father’s name would have been
for him to be a legitimate God King, in the line from Osiris.
On balance this is excerpt indicates that Jesus inherited the
title ‘Son of God’ and gives us a clue to the route which would
have provided this outcome. By implication, it tells us that Jesus was inheritor of the title and (by extrapolation) must therefore have been a real link in the royal bloodline.
Other Epistles
There was one Epistle from a person living at the time of Jesus that was not included in the New Testament. This was an anonymous Epistle that is attributed to Barnabas; known as The Epistle of Barnabas.
We know from the contents that it was written after the destruction of the Jewish temple but before the Jewish Rebellion in 132 and because of that it is a book written between 70 and 130 CE. Nothing certain is known as to the author other than his name was Barnabas, but scarcely any scholars now ascribe it to the illustrious friend and companion of St. Paul. External and internal evidence here come into direct collision. The ancient writers who refer to this Epistle unanimously attribute it to Barnabas the Levite, of Cyprus, who held an honourable place in the infant Church. Clement of Alexandria does so again and again (Strom., ii. 6, ii. 7, etc.). Origen describes it as "a Catholic Epistle" (Cont. Cels., i. 63), and seems to rank it among the Sacred Scriptures (Comm. in Rom.,



261
i. 24). Despite its questionable authorship, it contains one assertion that is of interest;
XII (180) Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh, (181) is not the Son of man, but the Son of God.
The statement is in direct contradiction to Jesus’ many claims that he was the ‘Son of (a) Man’. One explanation is that Barnabas was aware of Jesus’ divine inheritance, he knew that
Ptolemy XIII was dead and that Jesus was now the legitimate holder of the Pharonic crown. The other possibility was that Jesus was now dead and He had assumed his enthroned position in the Heavens. If the author is the same Barnabas that took protective care of John-Mark who in turn could well have been the son of Jesus, then Barnabas would have been close to the study and contemplation of such questions. Because of that he could have had inside information and his claim would have been educated and understandable. The one thing we can be sure of is that Barnabas was not trying to argue with Jesus’ claim that he was The Son of (a) Man, as represented in the four Gospels.
There were a great number of letters and texts exchanged between early Christian fathers, philosophers and theologians including Mathetes, Polycarp, Ignatius, Justin, Ireneus, Tatian, Athenagorus, Clement, Tertullian, Felix, Origen, Hippolytus, Cyprian, Dionysius, Malchion, Alexander and Methodius. Most of these men were converts, some by way of the Apostles, and they had no firsthand knowledge of the new religion. They had acquired their beliefs by listening to



262
missionaries and zealots and by reading texts and letters that were circulated between the early centres of belief. It is evident from their letters and communications that many of the early Bishops and advocates of Christianity actually
believed that Jesus was the incarnate, ineffable Divine Son of
an omnipotent and eternal God and that he had been ‘made flesh’ in order to intercede with God the Father for the sins of
mankind. If Christian theology emerged out of the religion of Ancient Egypt, this fact had been hidden from many of these early converts and what on the one hand had been literal statements of Truth for the Egyptians had evolved into
spiritual, mystical and metaphysical concepts for the Christian
philosophers who were teaching the new ‘faithful’. Strains of
the words used in the Nicene Creed can be found in some of
the letters, which were written several hundred years before
the Council of Nicea was convened. They show that the ‘spin’
of modern day politicians was not new and that a dogmatic and self righteous approach was taken to encourage converts to the new faith. One early church father worthy of mention is Origin who was one of the prominent Christian philosophers in the second and third centuries CE. He was based in Alexandria and along with Clement, competed for influence of the faithful with
Rome. He suggests in his letters that Satan is a fallen star and
that “the redeemed” will take his place “among the stars of Heaven”. Commenting on Revelation 12: 7-9 which says that
Michael and his angels cast down the dragon and his angels from heaven, Origin writes:
“Do you not see that the dragon fought with the
angels, and when he was hard pressed he was



263
thrown down from Heaven. As he fell he drew with him a third of the stars. It is likely that these stars were divine powers which had
revolted with him, and they were borne down
with the dragon, as Isaiah said, ‘How the morning star fell from Heaven.’” 163
In chapter 7 of de Pricipiis - 0n Incorporeal and corporeal beings, Origin says;
“We think, then, that they may be designated as
living beings, for this reason, that they are said
to receive commandments from God, which is
ordinarily the case only with rational beings. “I have given a commandment to all the stars,” says the Lord.”
Origin does not look overtly towards Egyptian theosophy to validate his claims. Rather he calls on the Hebrew Scriptures and the prophets and quotes many of the claims of Paul and the other Apostles to substantiate his reasoning. In our next chapter, we will see evidence that there was an intertwining of many of the Hebrew and Egyptian traditions since Ptolemy II. Because of that, there might not have been need for a Jewish philosopher who had converted to Christianity to acknowledge the Egyptian roots of his beliefs. There is nothing in any of these works to invalidate our
hypothesis. The writers appear to have been sincere believers
that Jesus was the ‘only begotten son’ of an eternal, all
163 Origin and the life of the Stars; Alan Scott



264
powerful God who was the creator of all things. If our hypothesis is valid, the true identity of Jesus was either known to the authors of these works or they did not know and they truly believed in His divinity as the Son of an eternal and everlasting God Almighty. The true identity and ancestry of Jesus was probably only known to a small and a select few but those that did know could have been convinced that someone from the true and unbroken bloodline from Osiris was in fact divine. Certainly, as far as we can tell from Egyptian inscriptions the Egyptian people believed in the divinity of their Pharaoh. Whatever their beliefs, it is likely that they would have been equally true regarding the existence and locations of any children of Jesus. Such children would be Sons of God, whether their father was God in the sense of being a Pharaoh of the royal and sacred bloodline from Osiris or whether he was God incarnate, who took living form and died for humanity to atone for our sins against God the Father. In order to discover more precise clues, it is perhaps necessary to look at the beliefs and activities of others living at the time who were not believers. Chapter 14 Some clues found in the refutation of heretical beliefs
In addition to works published at the time that condemned Christianity, there were several works published by the early Christian fathers that condemned heresies against the faith and the church that proclaimed it. An analysis of these works may be helpful in our attempt to determine the true identity of Jesus, in that they identify those beliefs that the Christian



265
zealots knew to be common at the time and which they
thought might be a threat to their own inflexible theosophy.
One famous criticism was Origin’s criticism of Celsus’ The
True Word. This work was lost but portions of Celsus’ view of Christians and Christianity is available. The two most prominent exposures of heresies were; Against Heresies by Irenaeus and The Refutation of All Heresies by Hippolytus.
Origen Against Celsus
Celsus was a 2nd-century Greek philosopher and opponent of Early Christianity. He is known for his literary work, The True Word (also Account, Doctrine or Discourse; Greek: Λόγος Ἀληθής), which survives exclusively in Origen's quotations from it in Contra Celsum. This work, circa 177 CE is the
earliest known comprehensive attack on Christianity. Here we
include extracts from Origen’s refutation which are relevant to
our discussion;
Celsus accuses Him of having "invented his birth from a virgin," and upbraids Him with being "born in a certain Jewish village, of a poor woman of the country, who gained her subsistence by spinning, and who was turned out of doors by her husband, a carpenter by trade, because she was convicted of adultery; that after being driven away by her husband, and wandering about for a time, she disgracefully gave birth to Jesus, an illegitimate child, who having hired himself out as a servant in Egypt on account of his poverty, and having there acquired some miraculous powers, on



266
which the Egyptians greatly pride themselves, returned to his own country, highly elated on account of them, and by means of these proclaimed himself a God."
This account by Origen indicates that there existed a proposal that Jesus was a result of human birth and that he spent his
formative years acquiring skills in Egypt which he
subsequently used to market himself as a ‘god’ figure.
Our next quotation is even more significant to the discussion
in that it deals directly with Jesus’ parentage;
"when she was pregnant she was turned out of doors by the carpenter to whom she had been betrothed, as having been guilty of adultery, and that she bore a child to a certain soldier named Panthera;"
Origen quotes Celsus as someone who gives us a name for
Jesus’ father and the claim that Jesus father was ‘a soldier’. In relation to this name we are told; “A common appellation for
Jesus in the Talmud was Yeshu'a ben Panthera, an allusion to the widespread Jewish belief during the earliest centuries of the Christian era that Jesus was the result of an illegitimate
union between his mother and a Roman soldier named
Tiberius Julius Abdes Panthera.”164 This parentage is mentioned by other authors; “We
encountered the name Pandera in Bavli Shabbat/Sanhedrin; the Tosefta (with Pandera in the Qohelet Rabba Parallel) and
164 The Bible Fraud; Tony Bushby



267
(it) is the earliest attestation of this name in rabbinical
sources”165 “We now know that Pantera/Panthera was a Greek name that
shows up in a number of Latin inscriptions from the period,
especially as the surname of Roman soldiers.”166
The extent of Celsus’ credibility is unknown. What is known is that Origen’s refutation was a significant document and that
its existence means Celsus and his opinions were believed to be a serious threat. It certainly adds weight to the argument that Jesus existed and was fathered by a human intervention.
In relation to Jesus’ genealogy we are told by Origen that
Celsus asserts that;
... the "framers of the genealogies, from a feeling of pride, made Jesus to be descended from the first man, and from the kings of the Jews." And he (Celsus) thinks that he makes a notable charge when he adds, that "the carpenters wife could not have been ignorant of the fact, had she been of such illustrious descent."
Origen does not refute this quotation in a way that reveals where the Gospel writers obtained their information, which, if it did not come directly to them from Mary or from Jesus himself would have required compendious research. This
165 Jesus in the Talmud; Peter Schäfer 166 The Jesus Dynasty; James A Tabor



268
would add weight to the argument that Jesus’ father must have
been more than a random Roman soldier impregnating a Jewish peasant girl. The alternative is that the entire story was the construct of some Christian zealots. There have been claims of links to the Essenes but there is no evidence of this as the causation of the Christian religious establishment.
All in all, this refutation by Origen does more to compound our belief that Mary was descended from David and that David was Thutmose III, himself a link in the Pharaonic bloodline back to Osiris. It also adds weight to our hypothesis that the father of her child was Ptolemy XIII who is most likely to have been living under an assumed name at the time.
Origen writes that Celsus made several statements regarding the resurrection of Jesus. These statements are important since, if it is true that Jesus died and was resurrected in corporeal form then he would have needed to have access to the supernatural and it would be proof of his divinity;
“...... his power to say that He voluntarily
withdrew from the sight of men, and seemed only to die, without really doing so; but,
appearing again, made a juggler's trick of the
resurrection from the dead.”
Celsus to add, "If Jesus had really wished to manifest his divine power, he ought to have shown himself to those who ill-treated him, and to the judge who condemned him, and to all men universally, without reservation. For he



269
had no longer occasion to fear any man after his death, being, as you say, a God; nor was he sent into the world at all for the purpose of being hid."
Celsus claimed that ‘the resurrection’ was a contrived fiction.
He goes on to add substance to his claim, by claiming that if Jesus wanted to use his resurrection as proof of his divinity, he would have appeared to the world in general, not just to the select few disciples who would then have the job of convincing the world without any evidence to back them up. Origen refuted these suggestions with emotive statements such as; But a clear and unmistakable proof of the fact I hold to be the undertaking of His disciples who devoted themselves to the teaching of a doctrine which was a danger to human life, - a doctrine they would not have taught with such courage had they invented the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. 167
Celsus was clear in his assertion that Hebrews were Egyptians by descent and that Egyptian theology had much to offer;
"that the Hebrews, being (originally) Egyptians, dated the commencement (of their political existence) from the time of their rebellion,"
He says, indeed, that "we ridicule the Egyptians, although they present many by no means contemptible mysteries for
our consideration, when they teach us that; such rites are acts
of worship offered to eternal ideas.”
167 Origen against Celsus, Book 2, I.VI



270
These extracts from Celsus’ work show clearly that some
philosophers and theologians at the time claimed Hebrew descent from Egypt and that they showed respect for the Egyptian traditions.
It is quite remarkable how Origen, was open-minded enough
to believe the now strange idea of stars being ‘intermediate beings between angels and men’.168 At the same time, he was
dogmatic and self-righteous in his condemnation of Celsus’ assertions regarding the Jesus story, no matter how logical. He quoted Paul in response to the above, who said; “We speak wisdom among them that are perfect; not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, who come to naught, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden
wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory;
which none of the princes of the world know.”169 ‘The Faith’
was established quickly and it became entrenched in the dogma of the Church. The early Fathers were closed minded when any suggestions were raised that the story contained even the slightest flaw and they resorted to the Gospels, the Epistles and to the Hebrew Scripture to substantiate their arguments. In his refutation, Origen does more to give substance to the claims of Celsus that to eradicate them. Because of that, his refutation enhances the hypothesis that Jesus was of the Royal Egyptian bloodline.
Irenæus’ against Heresies
168 The Demiurge in Ancient Thought; Carl Séan O’Brian 169 1 Corinthians 2;6



271
The work of Irenæus Against Heresies (circa 180 CE), known as The Detection and Refutation of False Knowledge is one of the most precious remains of early Christian antiquity. It is devoted, on the one hand, to an account and refutation of those multiform Gnostic heresies which prevailed in the latter half of the second century; and, on the other hand, to an exposition and defence of the Catholic faith. The inclusion of a reference to any belief or practice indicates that that belief or practice
was known to Irenæus and that it was of some significance at
the time. There are 142 chapters to Irenæus’ work, most of which are focussed on the doctrine of the ‘Most High God the Father of all’ and the part of Jesus as the ‘Son of God’ in
Christian theology. We have extracted here, two sections that might contribute some small light on the true identity of Jesus;
“But again, those who assert that He (Jesus)
was simply a mere man, begotten by Joseph, remaining in the bondage of the old disobedience, are in a state of death having
been not as yet joined to the Word of God the
Father.”170
Specifically, in relation to the divinity of Jesus, he also quotes Caprocrates, (Circa 130 CE) and the Ebionites, who believed that Jesus was a man;
“The Ebionites, following these, assert that He
was begotten by Joseph; thus destroying, as far as in them lies, such a marvellous dispensation
170 Irenaeus: Against heresies, Book 3, Chapter XIX, I



272
of God, and setting aside the testimony of the
prophets which proceeded from God.”171
“They (Caprocrates followers) also hold that
Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was just like other men, with the exception that he differed
from them in this respect, that inasmuch as his
soul was steadfast and pure”172
From these quotations we can see, that there must have been a
strong body of opinion claiming that Jesus was just a man. The
‘heretics’ who made this claim were in many cases men of
learning who themselves refuted the idea that Jesus was divine
and the ‘Son of God’.
Their arguments are based on logic as they saw it but they take us back to the basic question we are attempting to address; If Jesus was human, how did the Christian movement get established? What was it that provoked the idea the Jesus was linked to the divine? How come that so many people came to the conclusion that Jesus was the Son of God? On what basis did Jesus himself propose his claim?
Irenæus suggested that the reason for their scepticism was the fact that they were not yet believers, which by any standards is tautological reasoning and adds nothing constructive to the argument.
171 Ibid; Book 3;Chapter XXI, 1 172 Ibid; Book 1, Chapter XXV, 1



273
The second extract from Irenaeus’ refutation indicates clearly
that the author believed in the intertwined nature of Egyptian and Hebrew scriptures;
“Since, therefore, the Scriptures have been
interpreted with such fidelity, and by the grace of God, and since from these God has prepared and formed again our faith towards His Son, and has preserved to us the unadulterated Scriptures in Egypt, where the house of Jacob flourished, fleeing from the famine in Canaan; where also our Lord was preserved when He fled from the persecution set on foot by Herod; and [since] this interpretation of these Scriptures was made prior to our Lord's descent [to earth], and came into being before the Christians appeared -- for our Lord was born about the forty-first year of the reign of Augustus; but Ptolemy was much earlier, under whom the Scriptures were interpreted; -- [since these things are so, I say,] truly these men are proved to be impudent and presumptuous, who would now show a desire to make different translations, when we refute them out of these
Scriptures, and shut them up to a belief in the
advent of the Son of God”173
The author makes clear that the scriptures were interpreted under Ptolemy, and translated into Greek. This is
173 Ibid Book 3, Chapter 21, 3



274
acknowledged to have been carried out by seventy two elders in the reign Ptolemy II, when Egypt ruled Judea. (circa 270 BCE).174 It was during this period that knowledge and appreciation of the scriptures of both cultures became known and appreciated by each side. This in turn could explain how Ptolemy XIII became educated in both the Egyptian and Hebrew theosophies and how his son, born in Judea would have been able to reconcile what he had been told of both.
In relation to the Crucifixion of Jesus, Irenæus comments on one Gnostic heretic, Basilides who taught from 117 to 138 CE. Basilides is believed to have written over two dozen books of commentary on the Christian Gospel (now all lost) entitled Exegetica, making him one of the earliest Gospel critics. Only fragments of his works are preserved that supplement the knowledge furnished by his opponents. The followers of Basilides (the Basilidians), formed a movement that persisted for at least two centuries after him. Interestingly, Irenaeus wrote that Basilides claimed that he inherited his teachings from Matthew and he quotes him as saying;
Wherefore he (Jesus) did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus
174 The Antiquities of the Jews, Book XII; Flavius Josephus



275
himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. 175
Here we have a significant Gnostic philosopher of the time, who claimed to have obtained information directly from Matthew and who was preaching that the crucifixion was a fraud. If this claim had any validity, it would imply that all the elements of the gospels that spoke of Jesus death, entombment and rising were equally untrue. In fact, it would indicate that the gospels were a complete deception. Basilides does not question the existence of Jesus; he only questions those aspects of the Jesus story that would require Jesus to be divine (in the sense of incarnate and supernatural)
From the refutations by Irenaeus we can see that there were philosophers and intellectual groups who questioned basics tenants of the mainline Christian doctrine – in particular, the immaculate conception of a Jesus as a divine being and the Crucifixion, and (by implication) the resurrection of Jesus. They do not make claims regarding Jesus heritage, albeit that Basilides is quoted as saying; (The men led out of Egypt) also affirm that the barbarous name in which the Saviour ascended and descended is Caulacau. (a name derived from Isaiah 28).
On balance, Irenaeus’ Against Heresies does nothing to invalidate our hypothesis. On the contrary, it presents second hand and circumstantial evidence validated by their refutation that supports the idea that Jesus was human and that the crucifixion and resurrection did not take place.
175 Irenaeus; Against Heresies, Book I, Chapter XXIV, 4



276
The Refutation of all Heresies - Hippolytus
Hippolytus is described as one of the first great Christian fathers (170 – 236 CE). He was based in Rome although he was Greek by birth and he was the disciple of Irenæus. His refutation is a comprehensive work, which identifies and details the prevailing philosophical ideas more clearly than did the work of his mentor. It includes a concise summary of each suggestion, ranging from the various belief systems of the Greeks and Druids to the arts of astrology and numerology. In this refutation there are several passages that might be relevant to an examination of our hypothesis, and these are included below. The first section we have extracted is a discussion of the Naassene belief system regarding the location of God in the stars and how as Osiris and/or Mercury this god caused all things that exist. The Naassene were a Christian Gnostic sect from around 100 CE. They claimed to have been taught their doctrines by Marianne, a disciple of James the Just who it is claimed by some to be the brother of Jesus. They were among the first to be called simply "Gnostics", as they alleged that they alone have sounded the depths of knowledge;
..........let us see how these (heretics), collecting together the secret and ineffable mysteries of all the Gentiles, are uttering falsehoods against Christ, and are making dupes of those who are not acquainted with these orgies of the Gentiles. The (Naassene) assert, that the Egyptians, who after the Phrygians, it is established, are of greater antiquity than all mankind, and who



277
confessedly were the first to proclaim to all the rest of men the rites and orgies of, at the same time, all the gods, as well as the species and energies (of things), have the sacred and august, and for those who are not initiated, unspeakable mysteries of Isis. These, however, are not anything else than what by her of the seven dresses and sable robe was sought and snatched away, namely, the pudendum of Osiris. And they say that Osiris is water. But the sevenrobed nature encircled and arrayed with seven mantles of ethereal texture -- for so they call the planetary stars, allegorizing and denominating them ethereal robes, -- is as it were the changeable generation, and is exhibited as the creature transformed by the ineffable and unportrayable, and inconceivable and figureless one. And this, (the Naassene) says, is what is declared in Scripture, "The just will fall seven times, and rise again." For these falls, he says, are the changes of the stars, moved by Him who puts all things in motion. They affirm, then, concerning the substance of the seed which is a cause of all existent things, that it is none of these, but that it produces and forms all things that are made, expressing themselves thus: "I become what I wish, and I am what I am: on account of this I say, that what puts all things in motion is itself unmoved. For what exists remains forming all things and nought of existing things is made."He says that



278
this (one) alone is good, and that what is spoken by the Saviour is declared concerning this (one): "Why do you say that I am good? One is good, my Father which is in the heavens, who causeth His sun to rise upon the just and unjust, and sendeth rain upon saints and sinners."But who the saintly ones are on whom He sends the rain, and the sinners on whom the same sends the rain, this likewise we shall afterwards declare with the rest. And this is the great and secret and unknown mystery of the universe, concealed and revealed among the Egyptians. For Osiris, (the Naassene) says, is in temples in front of Isis; and his pudendum stands exposed, looking downwards, and crowned with all its own fruits of things that are made. And (he affirms) that such stands not only in the most hallowed temples chief of idols, but that also, for the information of all, it is as it were a light not set under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, proclaiming its message upon the housetops, in all byways, and all streets, and near the actual dwellings, placed in front as a certain appointed limit and termination of the dwelling, and that this is denominated the good (entity) by all. For they style this good-producing, not knowing what they say. And the Greeks, deriving this mystical (expression) from the Egyptians, preserve it until this day. For we behold, says



279
(the Naassene), statues of Mercury, of such a figure honoured among them.176
The above excerpt shows clearly that the Egyptians had long believed that God was located in and around the seven main stars of Ursa Major. It also shows that the Egyptians belief
system was persistent and continued to influence thinking
regarding ‘the mysteries’ which pertained to procreation. It
tells nothing of the identity of Jesus Christ, nor does it help prove or disprove our hypothesis. Its only contribution is to illustrate the background of ongoing Egyptian belief out of which came the instigator of the Christian story.
The second quotation comes from Hippolytus’ ‘recapitulation of theologies’ and continues with the same theme;
Do not the Egyptians, however, who suppose themselves more ancient than all, speak of the power of the Deity? (This power they estimate by) calculating these intervals of the parts (of the zodiac; and, as if) by a most divine inspiration, they asserted that the Deity is an indivisible monad, both itself generating itself, and that out of this were formed all things. For this, say they, being unbegotten, produces the succeeding numbers; for instance, the monad, superadded into itself, generates the duad; and in like manner, when superadded (into duad, triad, and so forth), produces the triad and
176 Hippolytus; The eructation of all heresies; Book V, Chapter 2

tetrad, up to the decade, which is the beginning and end of numbers. Wherefore it is that the first and tenth monad is generated, on account of the decade being equipollent, and being reckoned for a monad, and (because) this multiplied ten times will become a hundred, and again becomes a monad, and the hundred multiplied ten times will produce a thousand, and this will be a monad. In this manner also the thousand multiplied ten times make up the full sum of a myriad; in like manner will it be a monad. But by a comparison of indivisible quantities, the kindred numbers of the monad comprehend 3, 5, 7 and 9.177
Again we see that the Egyptians believed that ‘God’ was a
logical concept and that he/it existed in a practical and calculable form. Again it shows nothing of the identity of Jesus Christ, nor does it help prove or disprove our hypothesis. Its contribution is to reinforce our claim that the background of ongoing belief had emanated out of Egypt. In condemning other belief systems as heresies, the early Christian theologians acknowledge that the theological construct from which all other systems grew was that of Egypt.
In the case of Celsus, the self righteous condemnation of his
claims throws light onto Celsus’ specific proposals regarding
the birth and death of Jesus.
177 Hippolytus, The Refutation of all Heresies, Book I, Chapter XLIII



281
Many of the Heresies (particularly the Ebionites and Cerinthus) mentioned by Hippolytus refute the virgin birth and claim that Jesus was human. This (if anything) adds weight to that part of our hypothesis, which relates to Jesus being human and to his divinity being no more real than that claimed by the Pharaohs of Egypt over three millennia.



282
Chapter 15 Mary Magdalene
Extrapolations of the notion that Jesus fathered children have been famously speculated by a series of authors over the years. In more recent times, the Lincoln, Leigh & Bagient book, The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail prompted a BBC documentary which created a lot of public interest and the basic theme of
the book was then exploited in a novel and a movie entitled
‘The DaVinci Code’ by Dan Brown.
All of these various texts portray the wife of Jesus and
therefore the mother of Jesus’ children as Mary Magdalene.
Thereafter, they have invited derision by focussing on a
conspiracy of covert organisations that they say exist to
protect the secret of Jesus’ marriage and of any bloodline that
has ensued. Indeed, and not surprisingly, critics of the propositions that Jesus was married and that there exists a lineage from Jesus Christ have been damning in their criticism. If the hypothesis that we here propose has merit, then Jesus would have been aware of his importance in the perpetuation of the Royal Bloodline. Given the trouble that Ptolemy had gone to, it is not difficult to imagine that Jesus would have received strict instructions, regarding his duty of ensuring the maintenance and pedigree of the lineage. If there is any validity to the claims that there was a bloodline
from Jesus then it is not difficult to imagine that the mother of
Jesus’ children would have been chosen very carefully. This selection would have been extremely significant, since Jesus’
own existence was central to the perpetuation of the bloodline



283
of which he was a part. Here we will examine the evidence for and against Mary Magdalene being the wife of Jesus in the various documents that attributed to her or which discuss her as a subject to the story being told. The first of these is The
Gospel of Mary, where it is generally agreed that the person
named ‘Mary’ is the person known as Mary Magdalene.
The Gospel of Mary
This document is found in the Berlin Gnostic Codex. It is a very important and well-preserved manuscript, which was apparently discovered in the late-nineteenth century somewhere near Akhmim in Upper Egypt. Importantly, the codex preserves the most complete surviving fragment of the Gospel of Mary and it gives us about half of the original text.
The story of this gospel is a simple one and involves a
discussion between ‘the Saviour’ and his disciples after the
resurrection. After Jesus leaves the discussion (at the end of
Chapter 4 of ‘the gospel’), Mary consoles the group and gives
them secret information. The text culminates in an argument between Mary and the other disciples concerning the nature of the information Mary has provided and of their mission.
We have extracted two verses that may be pertinent to our
analysis. The first relates to Mary’s status;
5 5 Peter said to Mary, Sister we know that the Saviour loved you more than the rest of woman.
Here we have a statement of Peter, written about the subject of the text, which the author reproduces. If this reproduction is accurate and there is no aggrandisement by the author, then it



284
is telling us that Mary was the closest female to Jesus. It does not state that they were married, but it is a reasonable place to start any examination. By implication, it also tells us (if the author was in fact Mary) that Mary was not reticent regarding her relationship with Jesus, quite the opposite in fact.
Our second extract refers to Jesus’ instructions to the group,
where he is reported to have said;
4 37 Go then and preach the gospel of the Kingdom.
This instruction is strange in that it mentions a ‘kingdom’
without stating which kingdom it refers to. In the Gospels Jesus variously mentions the Kingdom of God (Mat 6;33, Luke 17;20), The Kingdom of Heaven (Mat 13;52, 13;47, 13;44) , and the Kingdom of the Son of Man (Mat 16;28). Further on in the Gospel of Mary (chapter 5, verse 1) immediately after Jesus departure, the document states; ‘But they were grieved. They wept greatly, saying, How shall we go to the Gentiles and preach the gospel of the Kingdom of the
Son of Man? If they did not spare Him, how will they spare
us?’
This may be an indication that 4; 37 is talking about ‘The
kingdom of the Son of Man’. However, this is speculation and the question therefore remains; why didn’t the author, who
claims to have been a confident of Jesus, specify the kingdom that Jesus referred to? In the context of our hypothesis, there is a possibility that
Jesus was referring to an earthly kingdom and that his teaching
constituted the ‘gospel’ of that kingdom. If this was the



285
meaning of Jesus’ reported words then the only kingdom that
would fit would be the Egyptian kingdom and the gospel being
referred to would be the ‘set of beliefs’ that were at the heart
of the Egyptian theological tradition.
In chapter 5 of this gospel the author makes an exposition of
the private words of Jesus that she had been access to. She
tells the group; “What is hidden from you I will proclaim to you.” Mary then goes on in chapter 8 to give an explanation,
which has all the hallmarks of extracts from the Gnostic beliefs that grew out of the Egyptian mysteries and which mirrors the outline of a selection of these mysteries by Hippolytus in The Refutation of All Heresies (previous chapter);
13 Again it came to the third power, which is called ignorance. 14 The power questioned the soul, saying; where are you going? In wickedness are you bound. But you are bound; do not judge! 15 And the soul said; why do you judge me, although I have not judged? 16 I was bound, though I have not bound. 17 I was not recognized. But I have recognized that the All is being dissolved, both the earthly things and the heavenly. 18 When the soul had overcome the third power, it went upwards and saw the fourth power, which took seven forms.
This exposition may be confirmation that the kingdom being referred to was the ancient kingdom of the Egyptians with all of its spiritual and theosophical implications. Certainly, the



286
disciples who were in attendance were dumbfounded and the author tells us;
9; 1 When Mary had said this, she was silent, since the Saviour had spoken thus far with her.
But Andrew answered and said to the brethren;
“Say what you think concerning what she said.
For I do not believe that the Saviour said this. For certainly these teachings are of other ideas." Peter also opposed her in regard to these matters and asked them about the Saviour. "Did he then speak secretly with a woman in preference to us, and not openly? Are we to turn back and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?"
These simple extracts from The Gospel of Mary point to two possibilities;
o The first is that Mary was the confidante of Jesus who was closer to him than any other female and that she may have been his wife.
o The second was that she was aware of Gnostic philosophy, which seemed to be similar to that inherent to ancient Egyptian religious belief and that she and Jesus both wished this gospel or set of beliefs to be evangelised.
If this Gospel of Mary is a valid document and the Mary in the document is Mary Magdalene, it implies by implication that



287
the selection of documents and truths that were incorporated into the Christian cannon was biased to a particular end and that it omitted beliefs that were being espoused by the Gnostic movement to which Mary Magdalene and (by implication) Jesus were disposed.
The Lost Gospel
Recently, following a compendium of research, Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie Wilson published a book entitled The
Lost Gospel, with the subheading, ‘Decoding the Ancient Text
that Reveals Jesus’ Marriage to Mary the Magdalene’. They
claim that ‘Joseph and Aseneth is a Christian story – a Gospel
if you will – about Jesus.’
The book was described by at least one reviewer as ‘tosh’.
Some like Ross Shepherd Kraemer and Rivka Nir however, believe that the work is Christian in origin, not Jewish and that
it did refer to Jesus in allegorical terms. Kraemer is convinced
that ‘this part of the story takes place in history and narrates
the deeds of historical persons’.178 The Lost Gospel sets out to show that an ancient Syriac manuscript, which had been translated from its original
Greek text, entitled The Story of Joseph the Just and Aseneth
his wife was in fact the story of Jesus’ meeting with and
marriage with Mary Magdalene. It is compelling in its argument and it gives good reason to consider the possibility that the story is more than its title might lead one to believe.
178 When Aseneth Met Joseph; Ross Shepard Kraemer



288
In the Old Testament, Jacob (the grandson of Abraham) has four wives, one daughter and twelve sons (the fathers of the twelve tribes). Joseph and Benjamin are his sons from his marriage to Rachel. This family picture is duplicated in the Joseph and Aseneth story. The rest of the story is new in every respect. In summary, the story consists of the following elements;
 Joseph was in the service of the Egyptian Pharaoh as magistrate.
 One of the Pharaohs’ wealthy nobles was named
Potiphar, the priest off On.
 Potiphar had a beautiful and virgin daughter, Aseneth
 Pharaoh’s ‘first born son’ heard of her beauty and
asked his father to give her to him – his father turned down his request.
 Pharaoh sent Joseph around ‘the entire land of Egypt’
 During his journey and his supervision of the grain harvest, Joseph stayed at the home of Potiphar.
 Aseneth dresses up for the visit and Potiphar tells her
that he would like her to be betrothed to their royal
visitor, who he describes as ‘the saviour’
 Aseneth has a tantrum and refuses saying that Joseph
is ‘not one of my people’ and he is ‘the son of a shepherd’. She claims that she wants the ‘first born son of Pharaoh’, because he is ‘ruler and king of all Egypt’
 When Joseph arrives, Aseneth falls for him,
recognising him as ‘the son of God’ telling herself that



289
her ‘foreign counsellors’ have deceived her. She
observes Joseph from a tower
 Joseph sees her and on being told that she is a virgin and the daughter of Potiphar asks that she be brought to him.
 Joseph keeps her at bay and blesses her with a prayer.
 After he leaves, Aseneth goes into a love sick tantrum which lasts seven days.
 On the eight day she prays and receives a visit from ‘a man from heaven – alike in respect to Joseph’. He
tells her that she will be married to Joseph
 The man shares a honey comb with her and he blesses her seven virgin handmaids
 Joseph’s arrival is announced and Aseneth dresses
with a bridal veil as she had been instructed by the
‘man from heaven’  On Joseph’s arrival there is an ecstatic meeting
between the two
 Potiphar suggests that there be a wedding
 Joseph tells him that he needs to return to the Pharaoh
who will ‘give her to me’ – and leaves without ‘knowing his bride before the wedding’  Joseph asks the Pharaoh’s permission and he
summons Potiphar and Aseneth before him.
 Pharaoh blesses the union
 The two get married and have two children, Manasseh and Aphraim.
 After seven years, Joseph’s father Jacob came from
Israel to Egypt.
 Joseph and Aseneth visit and there is a warm meeting.



290
 Levi, one of the brothers of Joseph was a ‘prophet’ and ‘knew the secrets of God’.  Aseneth was seen by the Pharaoh’s first born son from
afar and he desired Aseneth.
 The first born son visits two brother’s of Joseph to
offer them gold for their allegiance in a plot to kill Joseph and take Aseneth for his wife.
 The two brothers reject the proposal.
 The first born son then called on two of the servants of Aseneth, and lies to them in order to persuade them to betray Joseph and Aseneth.
 The first born son indicates that he intends to kill the Pharaoh in order to complete his intentions regarding Joseph and Aseneth.
 This Pharaoh’s son sends an army of two thousand
men to help the two servants.
 There was a battle and Aseneth’s six hundred men
defeated the two thousand.
 In their retreat they confronted the Pharaoh’s son but
the boy Benjamin who was with Aseneth threw stones
at the Pharaoh’s son and struck him on the temple. He
then killed the remaining 48 men.
 The renegade servants of Aseneth confront her intending to kill her and capitulate when she prays for them.
 Aseneth insists that they be spared
 Pharaoh’s son recovers and Levi, Joseph’s brother
insists that he be spared
 On the third day, the firstborn died from the wound.



291
 Pharaoh dies and leaves ‘the diadem to Joseph’ who
rules in Egypt forty eight years.
 The diadem is passed to the grandson of Pharaoh who was a baby at the time the Pharaoh died
 Joseph is ‘like a father’ to the boy ‘in Egypt’ for the
rest of his life.
The principal arguments used by the authors of ‘The Lost Bible’ to convince us that this is an allegory relating to Jesus
and Mary Magdalene are;
o It was common to have ‘coded’ texts at the time that
did not call people in them by their real names o There is evidence in the gospels and other texts that Jesus had a wife and had brothers and that the Pauline Christian Cannon suppressed this. o The story is confirmed by other Gnostic texts such as
The Thunder, Perfect Mind in which the female author
says about herself; “I am the first and the last .... I am
the honoured one and the scorned one. I am the whore and the holy one. I am the wife and the virgin.” o The story seems to confirm what we know as Gnostic Christianity, which originated with the followers of the Mara, the lady – Mary the Magdalene. For Gnostic
Christians, especially Valentinians (Velentinus 100
160) it wasn’t the last supper or the crucifixion that was the most significant episode in Jesus’ life but his
marriage to Mary Magdalene. o A monk of the 6th century named Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor published a manuscript entitled; A Volume of



292
records of Events which have Shaped the World, which lists The Story of Joseph the Just and Aseneth his Wife as one of the five titles in the anthology, which the authors of The Lost Bible conclude was an ancient Christian text. o A sixth century letter from a monk involved in the translation of The Story of Joseph the Just and Aseneth his Wife which he claimed has something to
do with the word becoming flesh and is asked by an
anonymous letter writer to explain ‘its ‘inner meaning’.
o There is evidence that it was once a popular story inside the Christian community. o Scholars who have examined the text have dated it to
early Christian times.
o “Through typology, the New Christian movement
created an ancient history for itself by retroactively
usurping the Hebrew Bible for Christian purposes”.
o Scholars who have examined the document
overlooked the context of Eastern Christianity in
which it was written, and that community’s ‘fondness for typological analysis’ o Mary Magdalene and Aseneth’s names are connected directly via ‘the tower’. o Joseph is described as ‘the Son of God’
o They link the honeycomb and bees mentioned in the text to Artemis/(Isis) and point out that if their proposition is correct, Mary Magdalene was seen by her followers as an incarnation of Artemis/(Isis) – a direct connection with the Royal bloodline



293
o The marriage in the story was in fact the marriage and wedding feast at Cana described in John 2; 1-11
Without realising the implications (in terms of our hypothesis)
The Lost Bible states; “Because they were divine and human at
the same time, their act of procreation was a metaphor for creation itself. In this sense therefore, Egyptian based Christian Gnosticism was drawing on millennia – we reiterate millennia – of Egyptian tradition. So it is not surprising that
they viewed Jesus not merely as a prophet or messiah but,
literally as a god.”
If the interpretation of The Story of Joseph the Just and Aseneth his Wife by the authors of The Lost Gospel is valid, then it fits well with the hypothesis we have proposed. In fact it may be a more accurate interpretation of actual events than we could have hoped for. In this story, the Pharaoh, though King of Egypt is not a king
in the ancient Egyptian tradition: Neither he nor his firstborn
son is described as the ‘Son of God’. This means that they are
NOT presented as being in the divine line that connects back to Osiris and Isis. Additionally, we can deduce from the story that they are not from the same family or bloodline as Joseph or his father Potiphar. Despite this, when the Pharaoh dies, Joseph is delegated the role of Pharaoh, which he assumes for 48 years. If the story is allegorical as proposed by Jacobovici and Wilson, then it is significant that the person they believe to represent Jesus becomes Pharaoh and that he is given the title in a similar way to Ptolomy I, who (we propose), may have been the ancestor of Jesus. Aseneth is described in the story as having ten bed chambers in her tower housing gold, jewels,



294
exotic foods, replications of Egyptian gods and her seven
virgin servants. Potiphar, Aseneth’s father is described as
having a ‘manager of his home’. This means that Aseneth and
her family were people of considerable substance. When describing Aseneth to Joseph (7; 7-8) we are told;
Potiphar said; 7 “My Lord, the young woman
you see in the tower is not a foreign woman but our daughter, a virgin who rejects all men and foreign husbands. No one has ever cleaved to her. No one has seen her except for you today. 8 If you wish she may come to bow and greet
your nobility, because our daughter is your
sister.”
There are several aspects of these versus that bear
examination; not least Potiphar’s claim that ‘no one had previously seen Aseneth’ contradicts the earlier claim in the narrative that; ‘News of her beauty spread throughout the land’. (1; 6) In verse 8, Potiphar states that Aseneth is ‘your sister’. The
explanation for this in The Lost Gospel is that this was consistent with Gnostic Christian texts. A better explanation might be that it was tradition in Egypt that Queens married their relatives; ‘A new sisterly title, sister-wife reappears in Ptolemaic times, doubtless influenced by the brother-sister dynamic at the time’179 In 7; 10 Joseph responds by calling her
179 The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt; Aiden Dodson/Dyan Hilton



295
his ‘kinswoman’ and ‘like a sister’ indicating that he perceives
an affinity with Aseneth, other than that based on desire.
In the period between Joseph’s first visit and his return,
Aseneth laments and her prayers include some statements and claims that are worthy of mention;
12; 9 “I Aseneth, daughter of Potiphar the
priest, who, for some time, has been honoured
as virgin and queen, proud and prosperous
surpassing all women.”
12; 12 “And therefore, Lord, stretch out your
hands and lift me from the ground because behold, a wild animal, an old lion, persecutes me because he is father of the gods of Egypt.”
12; 20 “For, behold, all the gifts of my father,
Potiphar, given to me as an inheritance, are
empty and transient; for a gift of your
inheritance, Lord, is eternal and incorruptible.”
13; 8 And to you Lord my God I have fled. But you save me, because in error I have sinned against you, I a virgin, a stray and a child, 9 who said evil empty things against my Lord
Joseph because I did not know he was your
son.”
Here we see that Aseneth proclaims herself to be a Queen,
who is conscious of her duty to ‘God the Father’, who in our
hypothesis would be the Egyptian God Ra. She proclaims that



296
the Lord’s inheritance (the bloodline direct from Osiris) is
eternal and incorruptible and therefore is acknowledging that she is part of that inheritance. She then continues to voice her realisation that Joseph, is of royal blood.
In relation to our hypothesis, the most significant part of the
text occurs immediately before Aseneth’s marriage to Joseph:
18; 12 Her Foster Father joined her again to tell her that everything had been made ready. But when he saw her he was terrified and could not
find his speech. He was afraid and fell before
her feet. 13 Then at last he said; “what is this
appearance of virtue and marvellous beauty of
the gods? The Lord God of Heaven truly chose
you to be the bride of his firstborn son.”
Most importantly, he describes Joseph as the firstborn son of the Lord God of Heaven. There can be no ambiguity here Potiphar is proclaiming Joseph to be a direct descendent of God and therefore directly connected to Osiris, the Lord God of Heaven.
We do not know that The Story of Joseph the Just and Aseneth his Wife is an allegory concerning Jesus and Mary Magdalene. If it is, it seems to indicate clearly that the perpetuation of the Pharaonic bloodline is an important element in the union of the two of them and that Mary Magdalene was carefully chosen by Jesus to help continue the mission he was given by his father.



297
The Canonical Gospels
Mary Magdalene is referred to by name 14 times in the four canonical Gospels. She is not mentioned again in Acts or the rest of the New Testament. The first time Mary Magdalene is mentioned is in Luke 8:2;
After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
In this extract the author of the Luke Gospel tells us that Mary was among many people, including other women, who
travelled with Jesus and his disciples. Apparently she had
been ‘possessed by seven demons’, which may indicate that
she had been of somewhat fiery spirit and that during her time with Jesus, this spirit was calmed. In this verse from Luke, she is not described as Mary, the wife of Jesus. Rather, she is identified with Magdala her town of origin. This would seem to contradict the idea that she was married to Jesus. However, as we shall see from examination of other texts it is possible that her relationship with Jesus was deliberately played down and maybe even purposely avoided. The author of Luke indicates that these women contributed to the material needs of Jesus and his disciples. Because of this we can assume



298
Mary was wealthy in her own right, which raises questions about where her inherited wealth might have come from. There is no record of a first meeting between Jesus and Mary
but there are times when we can infer that she might have
been in Jesus’ company even though she is not identified
explicitly. One of these is in John 11 which describes the
raising of Lazarus, an incident that we have already discussed.
Towards the end of this chapter we are told: “Therefore many
of the Jews who came with/to Mary, and saw what He had
done, believed in Him.”180
The other places where Mary is mentioned by name all occur
in the verses relating Jesus’ crucifixion, his interment and his
resurrection. Many scholars have argued that her close presence during these moments is an indication of her intimate
relationship with Jesus and that because of this she must have
been Jesus’ wife.
Gnostic texts
There is one part of the Gospel of Philip which mentions Mary Magdalene explicitly;
“There were three who always walked with the
Lord: Mary, his mother, and her sister, and Magdalene, the one who was called his companion. His sister and his mother and his companion were each a Mary. As for the Wisdom who is called "the barren," she is the mother of the angels. And the companion of the (.......) Mary Magdalene. (.....)
180 John 11; 45



299
loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her (....). The rest of the disciples (......). They said to him "Why do you love her more than all of us?" The Saviour answered and said to them; "Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness."
Here we are told that Jesus kissed Mary Magdalene often and it is assumed that the word missing on the parchment that was discovered at Nag Hammadi was mouth or lips. This is not proof that they were man and wife but it is an indication that there was a special bond between them.
In Pistis Sophia ("Faith-Wisdom", by a group of Gnostic writings from the late third and early fourth centuries) the risen Jesus appears to his closest followers who include Salome, Mary Magdalene, and Thomas. Jesus then invites questions, to which he gives extensive answers. Thirty-nine of the forty-six queries come from the Magdalene. And Jesus is reported as saying that "Mary Magdalene and John, the virgin, will surpass all my disciples and all men who shall receive mysteries in the Ineffable; they will be on my right hand and on my left, and I am they and they are I . . ."
The Gnostic tradition is linked to the Ancient Egyptian tradition via the Mother God. In this context, the Gnostics claimed to have knowledge of the link to the Mother God via



300
Mary Magdalene; “One group of Gnostic sources claims to
have received a secret tradition from Jesus through James and through Mary Magdalene [who the Gnostics revered as consort to Jesus]. Members of this group prayed to both the divine Father and Mother: `From Thee, Father, and through Thee, Mother, the two immortal names, Parents of the divine
being, and thou, dweller in heaven, humanity, of the mighty
name...’”181
Summary
Mary Magdalene was an important member of Jesus’ inner circle. She is Jesus’ intimate confidant and companion, one who possesses significant insight into Jesus’ teaching that she received directly from him. Some call her the ‘first disciple’.
There is no direct evidence that she was the wife of Jesus. However, the circumstantial evidence does seem to point to an intimate relationship. Certainly, there is nothing in any of the texts which contradicts that possibility and which negates the hypothesis we propose. If the proposals of Jacobovici and Wilson relating to their analysis of the Joseph and Aseneth text are correct, then it would be the only document that directly supports the idea of Jesus being intrinsic to the perpetuation of the sacred Pharaonic bloodline.

301
Chapter 16 The offspring of Jesus
The beloved disciple
If it is the case that Mary Magdalene was the wife of Jesus and that they had children, it would not be surprising that these children would have accompanied them on their significant journeys though Palestine, Jordan, Cana (northern Egypt) and Israel. Any son of Jesus is likely to have been a close follower and might well have been referred to in the Gospels.
The most obvious candidate is the person referred to in John
as ‘the beloved disciple’ and who may have been the one leaning on Jesus’ breast at the last supper.
The traditional view is that the Beloved Disciple was the apostle John, one of the sons of Zebedee. This view can be traced back to Irenaeus (circa 180 CE) and it was made part of
the official Church History in the early 4th century.182
Arguments by some learned authors propose that the ‘Beloved disciple’ is John the Elder and claim that John, Son of
Zebedee is unlikely since he was a strong willed and determined personality;
o Jesus nicknamed him and his brother the “sons of Thunder.” (Mark 3;17)
182 Church History 6;25; Eusebius



302
o They asked Jesus for permission to call down fire from heaven to consume a village that had not accepted their preaching (Luke 9:54). 183
This proposition is refuted by the bulletin ‘The Disciple Jesus
Loved’ published by Andreas Kostenberger and Stephen O.
Stout who conclude that; “..... even though the reader cannot
say with absolute certainty that the author of the Fourth Gospel is the apostle John, the son of Zebedee, because the
author does not explicitly provide his name, he certainly
leaves more than enough hints to narrow the list.”
The beloved disciple is mentioned explicitly five times in
John’s gospels;
John 13:23-25: One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying close to the breast of
Jesus; so Simon Peter beckoned to him and
said, “Tell us who it is of whom he is speaking.” .....So lying thus, close to the breast of Jesus, he said to him, “Lord, who is it?”
John 19:26-27, When Jesus saw his mother, and
the disciple whom he loved standing near, he
said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took
her to his own home.
183 Jesus and the Eyewitnesses; Richard Bauckham



303
John 20:2-8 So she [Mary Magdalene] ran, and
went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the
one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They
have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do
not know where they have laid him.” Peter then
came out with the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; and stooping to look in he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. . . Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in. . .
John 21:7, Therefore, that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord." So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into the sea
John 21;20 Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them; the one who also had leaned back on His bosom at the supper and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"
Whilst he may have done so, it seems unlikely that the author
of John’s gospel would refer to himself in the third person this
way. Additionally, it seems only sensible that if Jesus was going to ask someone to look after his mother, he would ask his eldest son, who would be her grandson.



304
Whilst the Jewish tradition requires children to ‘honour their father and mother’ it makes no requirement to look after
and/or care for grandparents. This may be the reason that Jesus
tells the ‘disciple he loved’ to ‘behold your mother’ and thus
induce the sense of obligation that would normally apply to children in relation to their parents.
There is only circumstantial evidence that the disciple whom
Jesus loved was Jesus’ son. If he was, then the other three
Gospels must deliberately exclude him, which would confirm the early Christian pre-disposition towards hiding everything that might have led followers to question their proclamation that Jesus was God incarnate, Son of God Eternal. It might
also mean that they had been guided by Jesus to protect his
son’s identity. Whatever the truth of it, the mentions of the
beloved disciple create additional circumstantial evidence of the fact that there existed a bloodline from Jesus and do nothing to invalidate the hypothesis we propose here.
John/Mark
There are no other references in the Gospels to anyone who
could be easily identified as Jesus’ son or daughter. The only
other mysterious young person that could be a contender for
the role of Jesus’ son is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles.
This person too was named John but is described in the text as
‘John who was called Mark’;
Acts 12 12 And when he (Peter) realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.........



305
25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, taking along with them John, who was also called Mark.
This person is mentioned again in Acts 15
Acts 15 36 After some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are." ........ 37 Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. ........ 38 But Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work ....... 39 And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus
The verses from ‘The Acts of the Apostles’ imply that ‘John named Mark’ was young and needed guardianship.
We can only speculate why someone with one name, would be called another. The fact that this is admitted, in some ways nullifies any reason which is based on keeping his true identity secret unless the author of the verses in Acts knew of the double names but did not know that John, the real name was not supposed to be used. There has been much speculation concerning the identity of this person and some believe that he is same Mark the Cousin of Barnabas mentioned by Paul (Col 4;10) and (Tim 4;11).



306
There is of course the possibility that this John/Mark is ‘John the beloved’, mentioned above. Tradition tells us that
Barnabas preached in Alexandria and Rome, and was stoned to death at Salamis about 61 AD. He is considered to have been the founder of the Cypriot Church. There is a Gnostic text entitled The Acts of Barnabas - The Journeying and
Martyrdom of St Barnabas the Apostle, which purports to be
written by ‘John whose name was changed to Mark’. It starts
with the words;
I John, accompanying the holy apostles Barnabas and Paul, being formerly a servant of Cyrillus the high priest of Jupiter, but now having received the gift of the Holy Spirit through Paul and Barnabas and Silas, who were worthy of the calling, and who baptized me in Iconium.
The author also tells us;
“And Barnabas urged me also to accompany them, on account of my being their servant from the beginning, and on account of my
having served them in all Cyprus until they
came to Perga of Pamphylia”.
The full text includes an explanation of the journey of
Barnabas and John/Mark, describes the hanging of Barnabas
by the Jews in Cyprus and it culminates with John/Mark’s escape to Alexandria where he ‘preached what he had been taught by the Apostles of Christ’. If this document is authentic



307
and the words written by the author are true then John/Mark
would not be the son of Jesus, neither was he ‘the one who Jesus loved’. Given what we are told in this document and in
The Acts, we can believe that John/Mark was one of the early evangelists in Alexandria and had significant impact on the formulation of Christian opinion there.
The Lost Gospel
In the allegory The Story of Joseph the Just and Aseneth his wife, just as with the Joseph and Aseneth in Genesis, the couple had two sons; Ephraim and Manasseh. If the story is meant to tell us about the Jesus and Mary Magdalene marriage then it is telling us that they had two children. The names of these children were (presumably) changed to protect the document from condemnation and because of that it gives us no clue as to the names of any actual children if there were any.
There is no other direct reference to children or young persons, identified as off-spring of Jesus in the New Testament or in any other documents of that era that we are aware of. This does not invalidate our hypothesis but it implies that if there were children of Jesus, their existence and their identities were not promoted and they were probably kept hidden. Unless they had been sent away to be educated, it would not have been possible for them have been hidden from the entourage following Jesus. Because of that, if off-spring did exist, there must have been a reason why they were not identified.



308
Chapter 17 The Ptolemies
Since our proposition is that Jesus descended from the Ptolemaic Dynasty and that his father was Ptolemy XIII, it would be remiss to ignore anyone prominent who lived at the time of the early Christians who boasted Ptolemy as his/her family name. In fact there were two very prominent individuals with this family name, Ptolemy the Gnostic and Claudius Ptolemy;
Ptolemy the Gnostic, We have no details of the life of this Ptolemy. We know that he was one of the oldest pupils of Valentinus who lived prior to 180 CE and that it was through some of the pupils of this Ptolemy that Irenæus became acquainted with the ideas that were developed by the early Gnostics. Whether or not Ptolemy himself was alive when the Presbyter of Lyons wrote the opening chapters of his Refutation, somewhere about 185-195 CE, it is impossible to say. Only two fragments of the writings of this Ptolemy have been preserved: One is an interpretation of the magnificent Poem of the Beginnings still extant in the Prologue to the fourth canonical Gospel and the other is a letter to a lady called Flora, quoted by Epiphanius. Irenæus writes about Ptolemy and tells us; "I intend, then, to the best of my ability, with brevity and clearness to set forth the opinions of those who are now promulgating heresy. I refer especially to the disciples of Ptolemaeus, whose school



309
may be described as a bud from that of Valentinus." In Against Heresies (1.8.5.) he states;
Further, they teach that John, the disciple of the Lord, indicated the first Ogdoad, expressing themselves in these words: John, the disciple of the Lord, wishing to set forth the origin of all things, so as to explain how the Father produced the whole, lays down a certain principle,-that, namely, which was firstbegotten by God, which Being he has termed both the only-begotten Son and God, in whom the Father, after a seminal manner, brought forth all things. By him the Word was produced, and in him the whole substance of the Aeons, to which the Word himself afterwards imparted form. Since, therefore, he treats of the first origin of things, he rightly proceeds in his teaching from the beginning, that is, from God and the Word. And he expresses himself thus: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God." [John 1:1-2] Having first of all distinguished these three-Gods, the Beginning and the Word-he again unites them that he may exhibit the production of each of them, that is, of the Son and of the Word, and may at the same time show their union with one another, and with the Father. For "the beginning" is in the Father, and of the Father, while "the Word"



310
is in the beginning, and of the beginning. Very properly, then, did he say, "In the beginning was the Word," for He was in the Son; "and the Word was with God," for He was the beginning; "and the Word was God," of course, for that which is begotten of God is God. "The same was in the beginning with God" - this clause discloses the order of production. "All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made;" [John 1:3] for the Word was the author of form and beginning to all the Aeons that came into existence after Him. But "what was made in Him," says John, "is life." [John 1:3-4] Here again he indicated conjunction; for all things, he said, were made by Him, but in Him was life. This, then, which is in Him, is more closely connected with Him than those things which were simply made by Him, for it exists along with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds, "And the life was the light of men," while thus mentioning Anthropos, he indicated also Ecclesia by that one expression, in order that, by using only one name, he might disclose their fellowship with one another, in virtue of their conjunction. For Anthropos and Ecclesia spring from Logos and Zoe. Moreover, he styled life (Zoe) the light of men, because they are enlightened by her, that is, formed and made manifest. This also Paul declares in these words: "For whatsoever doth make manifest is



311
light." [Eph. 5:13] Since, therefore, Zoe manifested and begat both Anthropos and Ecclesia, she is termed their light. Thus, then, did John by these words reveal both other things and the second Tetrad, Logos and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia. And still further, he also indicated the first Tetrad. For, in discoursing of the Saviour and declaring that all things beyond the Pleroma received form from Him, he says that He is the fruit of the entire Pleroma. For He styles Him a "light which shineth in darkness, and which was not comprehended" [John 1:5] by it, inasmuch as, when He imparted form to all those things which had their origin from passion, He was not known by it. He also styles Him Son, and Aletheia, and Zoe, and the "Word made flesh, whose glory," he says, "we beheld; and His glory was as that of the Only-begotten (given to Him by the Father), full of grace and truth." [compare John 1:14] (But what John really does say is this: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.") Thus, then, does he [according to them] distinctly set forth the first Tetrad, when he speaks of the Father, and Charis, and Monogenes, and Aletheia. In this way, too, does John tell of the first Ogdoad, and that which is the mother of all the Aeons. For he mentions the Father, and Charis, and



312
Monogenes, and Aletheia, and Logos, and Zoe, and Anthropos, and Ecclesia. Such are the views of Ptolemaeus.
Here we can see that Ptolemy (as quoted) was interested in the relationship between Father and Son and their link to the originating Father in the heavens, thus specifying the divine inheritance.
If this person believed that he was a near descendant of Jesus,
had been told that he was pretender to the title ‘Son of God’
(in the Heavens) and that his status was to be a living GodKing like his father and yet he found himself to be very human, this subject would have been very important. In this
context, it is small wonder that attempted to find a rational
link to ‘God’ and to explain this link in the framework of the
education he had received and the traditional inheritance of which he believed himself to be a part. There is no proof of any relationship between Ptolemy the Gnostic and Jesus but in the context of our hypothesis, it is worth keeping an open mind. Irenaeus refers to the views of Ptolemy regarding Jesus being the ‘Son of Man’ in Against Heresies 1.12.
But the followers of Ptolemy say that he [Bythos] has two consorts, which they also name Diatheses (affections), viz., Ennoae and Thelesis. For, as they affirm, he first conceived the thought of producing something, and then willed to that effect. Wherefore, again, these two affections, or powers, Ennoea and Thelesis, having intercourse, as it were, between



313
themselves, the production of Monogenes and Aletheia took place according to conjunction. These two came forth as types and images of the two affections of the Father,-visible representations of those that were invisible,Nous (i.e., Monogenes) of Thelesis, and Aletheia of Ennoea, and accordingly the image resulting from Thelesis was masculine, while
that from Ennoea was feminine. Thus Thelesis
(will) became, as it were, a faculty of Ennœa
(thought). For Ennoea continually yearned after offspring; but she could not of herself bring forth that which she desired. But when the power of Thelesis (the faculty of will) came upon her, then she brought forth that on which she had brooded. 2. These fancied beings (like the Jove of Homer, who is represented as passing an anxious sleepless night in devising plans for honouring Achilles and destroying numbers of the Greeks) will not appear to you, my dear friend, to be possessed of greater knowledge than He who is the God of the universe. He, as soon as He thinks, also performs what He has willed; and as soon as He wills, also thinks that which He has willed; then thinking when He wills, and then willing when He thinks, since He is all thought, [all will, all mind, all light] 155 all eye, all ear, the one entire fountain of all good things. 3. Those of them, however, who are deemed more skilful than the persons who have just been mentioned,



314
say that the first Ogdoad was not produced gradually, so that one Aeon was sent forth by another, but that all the Aeons were brought into existence at once by Propator and his Ennoea. He (Colorbasus) affirms this as confidently as if he had assisted at their birth. Accordingly, he and his followers maintain that Anthropos (Adamas) and Ecclesia were not produced, as others hold, from Logos and Zoe; but, on the contrary, Logos and Zoe from Anthropos and Ecclesia. But they express this in another form, as follows: When the Propator conceived the thought of producing something; he received the name of Father. But because what he did produce was true, it was named Aletheia. Again, when he wished to reveal himself, this was termed Anthropos. Finally, when he produced those whom he had previously thought of, these were named Ecclesia. Anthropos, by speaking, formed Logos: this is the first-born son. But Zoe followed upon Logos; and thus the first Ogdoad was completed. 4. They have much contention also among themselves respecting the Saviour. For some maintain that he was formed out of all; wherefore also he was called Eudocetos, because the whole Pleroma was well pleased through him to glorify the Father. But others assert that he was produced from those ten Aeons alone who sprung from Logos and Zoe, and that on this account he was called Logos



315
and Zoe, thus preserving the ancestral names. Others, again, affirm that he had his being from those twelve Aeons who were the offspring of Anthropos and Ecclesia; and on this account he acknowledges himself the Son of man, as being a descendant of Anthropos. Others still, assert that he was produced by Christ and the Holy Spirit, who were brought forth for the security of the Pleroma; and that on this account he was called Christ, thus preserving the appellation of the Father, by whom he was produced. And there are yet others among them who declare that the Propator of the whole, Proarche, and Proanennoetos is called Anthropos; and that this is the great and abstruse mystery, namely, that the Power which is above all others, and contains all in his embrace, is termed Anthropos; hence does the Saviour style himself the "Son of man."
Again, we see from third party references that Ptolemy the
Gnostic had been teaching ‘gnosis’ in relation to the
connection between Jesus and Creator God(s) in the heavens. Interestingly, the phraseology indicates that the Egyptian
belief had become Hellenised and that it was these Hellenised
beliefs that were at the source of Ptolemy’s Gnosticism.
The only direct link to Ptolemy the Gnostic is the letter he wrote to Flora, which was preserved by Epiphanius in his work Against Heresies, (33.3.1 - 33.7.10), which is duplicated below;



316
The Law was ordained through Moses, my dear sister Flora, has not been understood by many persons, who have accurate knowledge neither of him who ordained it nor of its commandments. I think that this will be perfectly clear to you when you have learned the contradictory opinions about it. Some say that it is legislation given by God the Father; others, taking the contrary course, maintain stubbornly that it was ordained by the opposite, the Devil who causes destruction, just as they attribute the fashioning of the world to him, saying that he is the Father and maker of this universe. Both are completely in error; they refute each other and neither has reached the truth of the matter. For it is evident that the Law was not ordained by the perfect God the Father, for it is secondary, being imperfect and in need of completion by another, containing commandments alien to the nature and thought of such a God. On the other hand, one cannot impute the Law to the injustice of the opposite, God, for it is opposed to injustice. Such persons do not comprehend what was said by the Saviour. For a house or city divided against itself cannot stand [Matt 12:25], declared our Saviour. Furthermore, the apostle says that creation of the world is due to him, for Everything was



317
made through him and apart from him nothing was made. [John 1:3] Thus he takes away in advance the baseless wisdom of the false accusers, and shows that the creation is not due to a God who corrupts but to the one who is just and hates evil. Only unintelligent men have this idea, men who do not recognize the providence of the creator and have blinded not only the eye of the soul but also of the body. From what has been said, it is evident that these persons entirely miss the truth; each of the two groups has experienced this, the first because they do not know the God of justice, the second because they do not know the Father of all, who alone was revealed by him who alone came. It reminds for us who have been counted worthy of the knowledge of both these to provide you with an accurate explanation of the nature of the Law and the legislator by whom it was ordained. We shall draw the proofs of what we say from the words of the Saviour, which alone can lead us without error to the comprehension of reality. First, you must learn that the entire Law contained in the Pentateuch of Moses was not ordained by one legislator - I mean, not by God alone, some commandments are Moses', and some were given by other men. The words of the Saviour teach us this triple division. The first part must be attributed to God alone, and his legislation; the second to Moses - not in the



318
sense that God legislates through him, but in the sense that Moses gave some legislation under the influence of his own ideas; and the third to the elders of the people, who seem to have ordained some commandments of their own at the beginning. You will now learn how the truth of this theory is proved by the words of the Saviour. In some discussion with those who dispute with the Saviour about divorce, which was permitted in the Law, he said; Because of your hardheartedness Moses permitted a man to divorce his wife; from the beginning it was not so; for God made this marriage, and what the Lord joined together, man must not separate. [Matt 19:8] In this way he shows there is a Law of God, which prohibits the divorce of a wife from a husband, and another law, that of Moses, which permits the breaking of this yoke because of hard-heartedness. In fact, Moses lays down legislation contrary to that of God; for joining is contrary to not joining. But if we examine the intention of Moses in giving this legislation, it will be seen that he did not give it arbitrarily or of his own accord, but by the necessity because of the weakness of those for whom the legislation was given. Since they were unable to keep the intention of God, according to which it was not lawful for them to reject their wives, with whom some of them disliked to live, and therefore were in the



319
danger of turning to greater injustice and thence to destruction, Moses wanted to remove the cause of dislike, which was placing them in jeopardy of destruction. Therefore because of the critical circumstances, choosing a lesser evil in place of a greater, he ordained, on his own accord, a second law, that of divorce, so that if they could not observe the first, they might keep this and not turn to unjust and evil actions, through which complete destruction would be the result for them. This was his intention when he gave legislation contrary to that of God. Therefore it is indisputable that here the law of Moses is different from the Law of God, even if we have demonstrated the fact from only one example. The Saviour also makes plain the fact that there are some traditions of the elders interwoven in the Law; for God, he says, Said, Honour your father and your mother, that it may be well with you, But you, .... he says addressing the elders,...have declared as a gift to God, that by which you have nullified the Law of God through the tradition of your elders. Isaiah also proclaimed this, saying, This people honours me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, teaching precepts which are the commandments of men.[Matt 15:4-9].
Therefore it is obvious that the whole Law is divided into three parts; we find in it the legislation of Moses, of the elders, and of God



320
himself. This division of the entire Law, as made by us, has brought to light what is true in it. This part, the Law of God himself, is in turn divided into three parts: the pure legislation not mixed with evil, which properly called Law, which the Saviour came not to destroy but to complete [Matt 5:17] -- for what he completed was not alien to him but needed completion, for it did not possess perfection; next the legislation interwoven with the inferiority and injustice, which the Saviour destroyed because it was alien to his nature; and finally, the legislation which is allegorical and symbolic, an image of what is spiritual and transcendent, which the Saviour transferred from the perceptible and phenomenal to the spiritual and invisible. The Law of God, pure and not mixed with inferiority, is the Decalogue, those ten sayings engraved on two tables, forbidding things not to be done and enjoining things to be done. These contain pure but imperfect legislation and required the completion made by the Saviour. There is also the law interwoven with injustice, laid down for vengeance and the requital of previous injuries, ordaining that an eye should be cut out for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, and that a murder should be avenged by a murderer. The person who is the second one to be unjust is no less unjust than the first; he simply changes the order of events while



321
performing the same action. Admittedly, this commandment was a just one and still is just, because of the weakness of those for whom the legislation was made so they would not transgress the pure law. But it is alien to the nature and goodness of the Father of all. No doubt it was appropriate to the circumstances, or even necessary; for he who does not want one murder committed, saying, You shall not kill and then commanded a murder to be repaid by another murder, has given a second law which enjoins two murders although he had forbidden one. This fact proves that he was unsuspectingly the victim of necessity. This is why, when his son came, he destroyed this part of the law while admitting that it came from God. He counts this part of the law as in the old religion, not only in other passages but also where he said; God said, He who curses father or mother shall surely die.
Finally, there is the allegorical (exemplary) part, ordained in the image of the spiritual and transcendent matters, I mean the part dealing with offerings and circumcision and the Sabbath and fasting and Passover and unleavened bread and other similar matters. Since all these things are images and symbols, when the truth was made manifest they were translated to another meaning. In their phenomenal appearance and their literal application they were destroyed, but in their



322
spiritual meaning they were restored; the names remained the same but the content was changed. Thus the Saviour commanded us to make offerings not of irrational animals or of the incense of this worldly sort, but of spiritual praise and glorification and thanksgiving and of sharing and well-doing with our neighbours. He wanted us to be circumcised, not in regard to our physical foreskin but in regard to our spiritual heart; to keep the Sabbath, for he wishes us to be idle in regard to evil works; to fast, not in physical fasting but in spiritual, in which there is abstinence from everything evil. Among us external fasting is also observed, since it can be advantageous to the soul if it is done reasonably, not for imitating others or from habit or because of a special day appointed for this purpose. It is also observed so that those who are not yet able to keep the true fast may have a reminder of it from the external fast. Similarly, Paul the apostle shows that the Passover and the unleavened bread are images when he says; Christ our Passover has been sacrificed, in order that you may be unleavened bread, not containing leaven (by leaven he here means evil), but may be a new lump. [1 Cor 5:7] Thus the Law of God itself is obviously divided into three parts. The first was completed by the Saviour, for the commandment, You shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery, you shall



323
not swear falsely are included in the forbidding of anger, desire and swearing. The second part was entirely destroyed, for an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth interwoven in with injustice, was destroyed by the Saviour through its opposite. Opposites cancel out, For I say to you, do not resist the evil man, but if anyone strikes you, turn the other cheek to him.
Finally, there is the part translated and changed from the literal to the spiritual, this symbolic legislation which is an image of transcendent things. For the images and symbols which represent other things were good as long as the Truth has not come; but since the Truth has come, we must perform the actions of the Truth, not those of the image. The disciples of the Saviour and the Apostle Paul showed that this theory is true, speaking of the part dealing with images, as we have already said, in mentioning The Passover for us and the Unleavened bread; for the law interwoven with injustice when he says that the law of commandments in ordinances were destroyed [Eph 2:15]; and of that not mixed with anything inferior when he says that The law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good [Rom 7:12]. I think I have shown you sufficiently, as well as one can in brief compass, the addition of human legislation in the Law and the triple division of the Law of God itself.



324
It remains for us to say who this God is who ordained the Law; but I think this too has been shown you in what we have already said, if you have listened to it attentively. For if the Law was not ordained by the perfect God himself, as we have already thought you, nor by the devil, a statement one cannot possibly make, the legislator must be someone other than these two. In fact, He is the demiurge and maker of this universe and everything in it; and because he is essentially different from these two and is between them, he is rightly given the name, intermediate. And if the perfect God is good by nature, in fact he is, for our Saviour declared that there is only a single good God, his Father whom he manifested; and if the one who is the opposite nature is evil and wicked, characterized by injustice; then the one situated between the two is neither good nor evil or unjust, but can properly be called just, since he is the arbitrator of the justice which is his. On the one hand, this god will be inferior to the perfect God and the lower than his justice, since he is generated and not un-generated -- there is only one un-generated Father, from whom are all things [1 Cor 8:6], since all things depend on him in their own ways. On the other hand, he will be greater and more powerful than the adversary, by nature, since he has a substance of either of them. The substance of the



325
adversary is corruption and darkness, for he is material and complex, while the substance of the un-generated Father of all is in corruption and self-existent light, simple and homogeneous. The substance of the latter produced a double power, while the Saviour is an image of the greater one. And now, do not let this trouble you for the present in your desire to learn how from one first principle of all, simple, and acknowledged by us and believed by us, un-generated and incorruptible and good, were constituted these natures of corruption and the Middle, which are different substances, although it is characteristic of the good to generate and produce things which are like itself and have the same substance. For, if God permit, you will later learn about their origin and generation, when you are judged worthy of the apostolic tradition which we too have received by succession. We too are able to prove all our points by the teaching of the Saviour. In making these brief statements to you, my sister Flora, I have not grown weary; and while I have treated the subject with brevity, I have also discussed it sufficiency. These points will be of great benefit to you in the future, if like fair and good ground you have received fertile seeds and go on to show forth their fruit.



326
Whilst we know that Irenaeus obtained information from disciples of Ptolemy the Gnostic and that this fact dates Ptolemy to be earlier that 180 CE and probably nearer 150 CE, this letter to Flora indicates clearly that Ptolemy the Gnostic was not alive at the time of Jesus since he quotes the Gospels and the Epistles by chapter and verse. His letter must therefore have been written at a time when such references had become known and standard in the Christian world. In the letter to Flora he shows that family, in the sense of husband, wife and offspring are important to him and he justifies Jesus authority to pronounce on law, in the sense of social regulation.
At best, Ptolemy the Gnostic was a descendant of Jesus, (in relation to the hypothesis we propose) at worst he was a follower of the Gnostics that existed alongside but separate from the Pauline Christian movement. There are several significant (but circumstantial) elements to these works and quotations which perhaps assist us in a our quest to establish a lineage from Jesus;
o The fact that Ptolemy is quoted and reported by Irenaeus as he is indicates that he was a much respected figure in the Christian world and that his
teaching carried weight. Irenaeus even tells us that
Ptolemy had ‘followers’ or disciples.
o The Gnostic teachings of Ptolemy the Gnostic seem to mirror those in the Gospel of Mary Magdalene



327
o In the letter to Ruth, Ptolemy claims that he had
received the ‘apostolic tradition by succession’. This may refer to his being ‘appointed’ as a Bishop and
that the hands-on ceremony involved was interpreted
as passing the apostolic tradition ‘by succession.’
Alternatively, it could relate to Ptolemy claiming a genealogical succession.
We cannot claim that a bloodline from Jesus existed nor that it included Ptolemy the Gnostic. The only thing that we can say, based on the minimum evidence available, is that it is possible.
Claudius Ptolemy (c 85-165 CE) was a Greco-Egyptian writer known as a mathematician, astronomer, geographer and astrologer. He lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt, where he wrote in Greek, but held Roman citizenship. Beyond that, few reliable details of his life are known. His birthplace has been given as Ptolemais Hermiou in the Thebaid (the South of Egypt stretching from Abydos to Aswan) in an uncorroborated statement by the 14th century astronomer Theodore Meliteniotes. One of his teachers is
believed to have been Theon of Smyrna.
The 9th-century Persian astronomer Abu Ma’shar assumed Ptolemy to be a member of Egypt’s royal lineage, stating that
the ten kings of Egypt who followed Alexander were wise; "and included Ptolemy the Wise, who composed the book of
the Almagest".
Ptolemy’s several great works are discussed below and
include;



328
The Almagest: This document is a critical source of information on ancient Greek astronomy and is one of the most influential scientific works in history. It has also been
valuable to students of mathematics because it documents the
ancient Greek mathematician Hipparchus’s work, which has
been lost. Hipparchus wrote about trigonometry, but because his works no longer exist, mathematicians use Ptolemy's book as their source for Hipparchus's work and ancient Greek
trigonometry in general. Ptolemy increased the number of
stars mapped from Hipparchus’ 850 to 1022. This probably
means that he had access to records maintained (in secret) by astronomer-priests brought up in the Egyptian tradition. In this work he includes the poem;
“I know that I am mortal by nature, and
ephemeral; but when I trace at my pleasure the windings to and fro of the heavenly bodies I no longer touch the earth with my feet: I stand in
the presence of Zeus himself and take my fill of
ambrosia”
In the text, Ptolemy describes: The kind of science which seeks after Him (God) is the theological; for such an act can only be thought as high above somewhere near the loftiest things of the universe and is absolutely apart from sensible things. But the kind of science which traces through the material and ever moving quality, and has to do with the white, the hot, the sweet, the soft, and such things, would be called physical; and such an essence since it is only generally what it is, is to be found in corruptible things and below the lunar sphere. And the kind of science which shows up quality



329
with respect to forms and local motions, seeking figure, number, and magnitude, and also place, time, and similar things, would be defined as mathematical. Betraying how his beliefs are akin the Ancient Egyptian tradition, he says; (Ch 2)
“Whatever is beyond this is fixed and
immovable, and the professors of our orthodox faith affirm it to be the empyrean heaven which GOD inhabits with the elect."
To have written the Almagest, Ptolemy would need to have been immersed in learning from an early age. His tutors would have been astronomer priests and since he lived and worked in Alexandria, we can assume that they would have been Egyptian. This would fit well with the idea that a son of Jesus would have been sent away to be educated, at an early age. The Geography: This is a treatise on cartography and a compilation of what was known about the world's geography in the Roman Empire of the 2nd century. Ptolemy relied mainly on the work of an earlier geographer, Marinos of Tyre, and on gazetteers of the Roman and ancient Persian Empires. As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest, Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned latitude and longitude coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe. Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the Midsummer Day increases from 12h to 24h as one goes from the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of zero longitude at the westernmost land he knew, El Hierro; one of the Canary

Islands. He illustrated the Earth to be spherical, albeit that this view did not become the established view until many centuries later. His work was probably the foundation for cartography as we know it today.
The Apotelesmatika or Tetrabiblos (a work in four parts) is his third work. It is an astrological treatise in which he attempted to adapt horoscopic astrology to the Aristotelian natural philosophy of his day.
Optics: This is a work that only survives in a poor Arabic translation and in about twenty manuscripts of a Latin version of the Arabic, which was translated by Eugene of Palermo (c.1154). In it Ptolemy writes about properties of light, including reflection, refraction, and colour. The work is a significant part of the early history of optics and influenced the more famous 11th century Optics by Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham). It contains the earliest surviving table of refraction from air to water, for which the values (with the exception of the 60° angle of incidence), although historically praised as experimentally derived, appear to have been obtained from an arithmetic progression. It is the work of someone dedicated to learning the workings of this important aspect of the human body.
Ptolemy’s Harmonics: This was an influential work on music theory and the mathematics of music. In it he showed how musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations and vice versa. This is called Pythagorean tuning because it was first discovered by Pythagoras. However, Pythagoras believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the



331
specific ratio of 3:2, whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve tetra chords and octaves. He presented his own divisions of the tetra chord and the octave, which he derived with the help of a monochord. Ptolemy's
astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the
‘music of the spheres’ where he defined his diatonic scale.
This prolific philosopher was born in the 1st century and attempted to provide answers to everything affecting the human spirit. His work espoused a unique view of reality and an appreciation of all things complex and mysterious. In the rhyme, which he includes in Almagest he talks of someone human who studies the Heavens and its movements and who finds himself elevated into the presence of God. If Jesus did have children, it is not difficult to imagine that he would have had them educated in the way that he himself had been educated. Within the overall hypothesis that we propose, Ptolemy XIII would have ensured that Jesus spent time studying the overlapping Hellenic and Egyptian religious and Pharaonic traditions and the links to the stars in the Heavens. This area of learning, which had been at the centre of the Egyptian religious tradition for millennia, was at the core of all contemporary belief systems. His predisposition to a bank of Egyptian inherited knowledge is confirmed in Chapter 3, Book 1 of the Tetrabiblos where Ptolemy tells us;
Of this, the Ægyptians seem to have been well aware; their discoveries of the great faculties of this science have exceeded those of other



332
nations, and they have in all cases combined the medical art with astronomical prognostication.
We can assume that children and grand-children of Jesus would have developed an in-depth appreciation and interest in
all the subjects addressed by Claudius Ptolemy. If he was
Jesus’ son he would not have been able to reveal his true
identity or his relationship to the Ptolemaic genealogical tree but that did not stop him from studying the meaning of these things. It is easy to imagine that any progeny of the Jesus (and
therefore Ptolemaic) bloodline had been informed by their
parents that they were in the ‘divine line’ and even that they
were in fact gods on earth, with links back to Osiris. At the same time, there would have been nothing godlike in their everyday existence other than their philosophical imaginings as they asked themselves fundamental questions about the earth, the stars and science (mathematics) and they attempted to rationalise the messages they had received from parents with the conflicting scientific evidence. There is nothing, other than his name, to link Claudius Ptolemy to Ptolemy XIII but what can be said of him is that his work and publications created a meaningful and lasting legacy in the field of science and betrayed a philosopher as eminent as any that succeeded him. There is no direct evidence Claudius Ptolemy was a descendent of Jesus. Strangely however, given that we have here two very prominent individuals, there is no evidence of any kind about family or progeny of him or of Ptolemy the Gnostic. The fact that they were both known by the name Ptolemy is the only link available to us.



333
All we can say is that there is a possibility (given our general hypothesis) that these men were descended from Jesus and that there is no information available to tell us that this is not possible.
There were other less famous people with the name Ptolemy in the early Christian era. The information we have regarding these individuals is detailed below;
Ptolemy (Acts of Peter) – a character mentioned in the Acts of Peter, who was a rich man trying to marry the daughter of Peter. The Acts of Peter tells us;
Ptolemaeus, unable to win the maiden by fair means, comes and carries her off. Peter hears of it and prays to God to protect her. His prayer is heard. She is struck with palsy on
one side of her body. (Then the text resumes.)
“The servants of Ptolemaeus brought the
maiden and laid her down before the door of the house and departed. But when I perceived it, I and her mother, we went down and found the maiden, that one whole side of her body from her toes even to her head was palsied and withered: and we bore her away, praising the Lord which had preserved his handmaid from defilement and shame and (corruption?). This is the cause of the matter, why the maiden continueth so unto this day.



334
Now, then, it is fitting for you to know the end of Ptolemaeus. He went home and sorrowed night and day over that which had befallen him, and by reason of the many tears which he shed, he became blind. And when he had resolved to rise up and hang himself, lo, about the ninth hour of the day, he saw a great light which enlightened the whole house, and heard a voice saying unto him: Ptolemaeus, God hath not given thee the vessels for corruption and shame, and yet more doth it not become thee which hast believed in me to defile my virgin, whom thou shalt know as thy sister, even as if I were unto you both one spirit (sic). But rise up and go quickly unto the house of the apostle Peter, and thou shalt see my glory; he shall make known unto thee what thou must do. But Ptolemaeus was not negligent, and bade his servants show him the way and bring him unto me. And when they were come to me, he told me all that had befallen him by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. Then did he (Ptolemaeus) see with the eyes of his flesh, and with the eyes of his soul, and many people believed (hoped) in Christ: and he/it did them good and (it) gave them the gift of God. Thereafter
Ptolemaeus died, departing out of this life,
and (he) went unto his Lord.”



335
Earlier in the paragraph this Ptolemy is described as wealthy,
but any son of Mary Magdalene and Jesus would probably
have inherited Mary Magdalene’s wealth and could therefore
have been described thus. However, if Peter had believed this person to be the Son of Jesus he would surely have said; ... (he) went unto the Lord or our Lord as he does in the previous sentence. This is perhaps semantics but there is little in the short reference to this Ptolemy that provides any clue about his parentage. It is unlikely that this person was related to Jesus.
Ptolemaeus Chennus (Hephaestion) (2nd century AD) This Ptolemy was grammarian who lived in the Greek culture of Roman Egypt. He wrote a series of imaginative but
fictional stories based on the Classical Greek personalities and
heroes in ways which are ‘free of things impossible to believe,
which offer knowledge above the ordinary, but which is not
unpleasing’.
There is nothing in these stories that in any way links the author to our hypothesis.
Ptolemaeus and Lucius, Christian martyrs.
In the Second Apology of St Justin Martyr we are told;
“And her quondam husband, since he was now no longer able to prosecute her, directed his assaults against a man, Ptolemæus, whom Urbicus punished, and who had been her teacher in the Christian doctrines. And this he did in the



336
following way. He persuaded a centurion — who had cast Ptolemæus into prison, and who was friendly to himself— to take Ptolemæus and interrogate him on this sole point: whether he were a Christian? And Ptolemæus, being a lover of truth, and not of a deceitful or false disposition, when he confessed himself to be a Christian, was bound by the centurion, and for a long time punished in the prison. And, at last, when the man came to Urbicus, he was asked this one question only: whether he was a Christian? And again, being conscious of his duty, and the nobility of it through the teaching of Christ, he confessed his discipleship in the divine virtue.”184
There is nothing here or elsewhere to connect this person to Jesus other than the fact that he was a Christian.
Having examined all of the above references to persons names Ptolemy, we are confident that any family connection to Jesus via the name Ptolemy cannot be authenticated. Despite that, the fact that we have no knowledge of any family connections to the various Ptolemies in the early Christian era means that a link cannot be ruled out. At the same time, since it is our contention that the bloodline is important, one would expect any direct descendant of Jesus
184 New Advent Article; Kevin Knight



337
to be married and to produce children. There is no mention of wives or children in any historical literature covering the Ptolemies listed above. To find direct evidence of a bloodline without someone making a statement that proposes or supports this notion is impossible. The best than can be found is weak circumstantial evidence from a time when any such evidence would be suppressed at worst and down-played at best. In that context, the best that can be said about the information we have about the Ptolemies in the early Christian period is that it does not eliminate the possibility of one or more of them being pretenders to the Ptolemaic crown but that there is no positive evidence to support it.



338
Chapter 18 The bloodline
Without DNA from someone close to Ptolemy XIII and matching DNA from someone living more recently, it would be difficult to prove a connection back to Ptolemy XIII. Even if such a link could be found, it would be impossible to place Jesus in the chain unless some of his remains could be authenticated and placed in the same line. For this reason, we can only rely on circumstantial evidence to support our hypothesis.
In 1972 and 1974 the BBC broadcast a series of programmes which were hosted by Henry Lincoln. The programmes focussed on the village of Rênnes-le-Chateau in the South of France and the antics of its curé Bérenger Saunière, the resident parish priest from 1885 until January 1917. In 1891 this priest is said to have carried out some refurbishment of the church and found coded documents hidden in the altar, which he then took to learned people locally and in Paris. These documents were difficult to interpret but they made reference to Dagobert 11, a Merovingian king who was assassinated in 679 CE. In the years following his discovery, Saunière spent the equivalent of several million pounds, which some believe was part of a hidden Templar treasure. Anyone visiting this small hill top village today will still find a stream of treasure seekers wandering around with their metals detectors, looking for the same hidden treasure. Following the TV broadcasts, Henry Lincoln was inundated with information from a variety of sources, some of which



339
added a new and enthralling dimension to the Rênnes-leChateau story. Based on this information Henry Lincoln joined forces with Michael Bagient and Richard Leigh and together they investigated the additional information they had received and the places and the people they were pointed towards. In particular they were directed towards a file named Dossiers Secrets in the Bibliotèque Nationale in Paris and an elusive figure named Pierre Plantard. This file alluded to an organisation called the Prieuré de Sion whose purpose was to reinstate descendants of the Merovingian bloodline onto the French throne. The results of their research was published in 1982 in a book entitled The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail and it listed as the Grand Masters of the Prieuré de Sion from 1133 which included such well known names as Leonardo DaVinci, Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, Claude Debussy and Jean Cocteau. The book exposes secret claims that the Merovingian blood line came from Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that the Prieuré de Sion existed to protect the bloodline. In 2012 a novel was published by Dan Brown entitled The DaVinci Code, which was subsequently turned into a successful movie. The story was concocted around many of the ingredients published in The Holy blood and The Holy Grail. – i.e. that there is a secret bloodline from Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Early in 2015, Henry Lincoln was interviewed for a television documentary and during the programme he stated that Pierre Plantard had admitted to him before he died that the documents in the Bibliotech Nationale were a hoax. This may well be true, but it is thought by some that this withdrawal may itself have been misleading and that it may have been made in order to take all the now baying bloodhounds off the



340
scent of the real truth. Certain things we do know; there was a
Merovingian bloodline which started with Merovée or
Merovech in the 5th century CE. This Frankish king’s routes
are shrouded in mystery. Gregory of Tours (538-594 CE) is the famous historian of the period and we are told of his writings;
Gregory's ambiguous sentence giving Merovech as "of the race of Clodio, according to some" has been much discussed. Many admit today that this formulation finds its explanation in a legend reported by Fredegar: Merovech would not be the son of Clodio but of a
maritime monster that had relations with his
mother, Clodio’s wife. In this case, one can
obviously accept the filiation between Merovech and Clodio185
In this account, Clodio (c 392-448 CE) is presented as someone similar to Joseph the Carpenter in that his wife is impregnated by a mysterious supernatural being. He was a king of the Salien Franks and was known as the Long-Haired King. He is believed to have lived in Thuringian territory, at the castle of Duisberg. His father is said to have been another mysterious and legendary figure, named Pharamond. Some modern scholars claim that he in turn was the son of Marcomer who is also known as Marcomir VI, a descendent

of King Priam Podarces of Troy by Priam's son Helenus from whom the Kings of Cimmerian Bosporus descend.186
There is nothing in historical records that helps link the Merovingian dynasty to Jesus. In the Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the authors suggest that the Holy Grail could in some
way be linked to the mystery. Specifically, they tell us; “In
many of the earlier manuscripts the Grail is called ‘Sangraal’ and even in later versions by Malory, it is called ‘Sangreal’. It
is likely that that some such form – ‘Sangraal’ or ‘Sangreal’ was in fact the original one. It is also likely that the one word
was subsequently broken in the wrong place. In other words
‘Sangraal’ or ‘Sangreal’ may not have been intended to divide into ‘San Graal’ or San Greal’ – but into ‘Sang Raal’ or Sang Real’. Or, to employ the modern spelling, Sang Royal; Royal Blood.” In chapter 15 they go on to say; “If our hypothesis is correct,
the Holy Grail would have been two things simultaneously.
On the one hand it would have been Jesus bloodline and
descendants – the ‘Sang Raal’, the ‘Real’ or ‘Royal’ blood of
which the Templers, created by the Prieuré de Sion were appointed guardians. At the same time the Holy Grail would have been, quite literally the receptacle or vessel which received and contained Jesus blood. In other words it would
have been the womb of Magdalene – and by extension the
Magdalene herself”.
Since we have no factual evidence to go on, we are forced to resort to an analysis of myths and legends and there is good
186 The Franks; Edward james



342
reason to believe that the ‘Holy Grail’ is a good subject for
such examination. In our previous work187, we showed a conclusive link between the Egyptian Mysteries, the Grail legends, The Tarot (which is thought to have originated in Egypt) and the Book of Revelation. The grail is normally presented as an elusive cup or vessel (that was used by Jesus at the Last Supper and has never been found). This has been
the characterization that has been transmitted through history
and has stood ‘the test of time’. The phrase ‘Holy Grail’ by
consequence has come to mean the secret revelation, answer or pot of gold at the end of some hidden rainbow. The first Grail story, Le Conte de Graal was written by Chrétien de Troyes between 1170 and 1190 AD. It was written following visits to Jerusalem by the founders of the Knights Templar. Perhaps significantly, there is strong circumstantial evidence indicating that during their early expeditions to the Holy Land these same French nobles came upon a cache of information, which was the source of the power and their subsequent downfall. The same persons assisted in the foundation of the Cistercian order of Christian monks who over the following century built more than 300 Abbeys and monasteries and propelled the commencement of the construction of the many Gothic Cathedrals that still exist today. Seven variations of Grail stories were written by other authors between 1190 and 1220 AD. Fifteen years after the emergence of the unfinished Conte du Graal, Wolfram von Eschenbach published Parzival. In the epilogue he claimed that Chrétien had failed to do justice to a tale that already
187 The God Secret; Greg Rigby



343
existed. By way of explanation, he claimed that the original
legend came from an Arabic manuscript discovered by a
“master”, Kyot in Toledo, in Spain. Kyot in turn spoke of Flegetanis; a “king of old time” who “could read the Heavens high”:
‘He read the stars and strange secrets he saw,
and he spake again low with bated breath and fearful, of the thing that is called the Grail. In a
cluster of stars was it written, the name nor their
lore shall fail’
Key symbols in the Grail romances are; the Grail itself, (whether cup or dish) the Lance, the Sword and the Stone. These same symbols (Cup/dish, Lance, Sword and Stone) are the four suits of the Tarot cards; Cup, wand or lance, sword and pentacle. The Ace of each of these suits in the enigmatic Smith-Rider-Waite Tarot deck duplicates the star pattern around the Ursa Major constellation at one of the Equinoxes
or the Solstices. The Book of Revelation which contains the
phrase ‘the mystery of the seven stars’ also features a
cup/bowl/vessel, a tree/spear a stone and a sword, bring us a connection between the Grail romances, the Tarot and the
Book of Revelation, which is the constellation of Ursa Major.
This final book of the New Testament talks about ‘a throne set
in Heaven and around the throne four living creatures before
and behind’;
And the living creature the first like (to) a lion, and the second living creature like (to) a calf, and the third living creature having the face as



344
of a man, and the fourth living creature like (to) an eagle flying.
The Gematria (numerical value) of this phrase is 25920 which is the length of the precessional circle of the poles in terms of the number of earth years it takes to be completed. The Ursa Major constellation becomes oriented to create each of the pictures mentioned in the above verse – the lion, the calf, the face of a man and an eagle flying - at the summer solstice position on each of the four quarters of this 25920 year precessional circle. (Fig 18). In so doing, the Ursa Major constellation and its appearance in the Heavens becomes the link between the Ancient Egyptian home of its god(s) and the one sitting on the throne in the enigmatic Book of Revelation.
Ursa Major was the home of Osiris in all his aspects and was the place where all the God-Kings would return when the
departed their lives on earth. This place was Heaven and
consisted of the ‘imperishable’ stars in Ursa Major that rotated
around the northern pole position without setting. The bloodline that the Egyptian Kings shared was their direct
link to Osiris and it was that that gave them the claim to the
title ‘Son of God’. Because of that, if Jesus was in fact the son
of Ptolemy XIII and, more importantly, was directly (through his mother) in this lineage, he would have been educated by his father to do all that he could to protect that bloodline. He would then have ensured that the importance of its protection was passed on to his children.



345
Fig 18 The Lion, the calf, the face of a man and the Eagle in Ursa Major



346
The Egyptians believed their pharaoh to be a God-King who
was the mediator between the gods and the world of men. He
was named ‘Son of God’. After death the pharaoh became
truly divine by joining with Osiris, the father of Horus and God of the dead. At his passing he passed on his sacred powers and position to the new pharaoh, his son. As a divine ruler, the pharaoh was the preserver of the god-given order, called Ma’at. We cannot be sure what the Pharaohs believed of themselves and of the authenticity of their connection with the gods. They must have known that they were human but the indoctrination they received might well have convinced them of their divine status and that they would rise to be with Osiris in Heaven.
As with their ancestors, it is entirely possible that Jesus and his kin were educated in such a way (by their parents and priests approved by their parents) that they too came to
believe that they were divine and would return to the Heaven
to join ‘God the Father’. They would most likely have seen
themselves as superior and privileged and felt condescending of the rest of humanity. That being the case, any descendants of Jesus would either have believed in their status but kept it to themselves or would have asserted themselves and their beliefs in ways they felt to be appropriate. At the same time, they would have needed to balance the danger of their true identity becoming known against the loss of credibility brought on by servility and/or anonymity. If a descendant of Jesus was a low-profile individual, he would probably have been judged to be weird by his contemporaries and would of necessity lived in a detached manner. This is an unlikely scenario, since this person would



347
have realised that to teach his own children of their inherited dominion would have been almost impossible if they could not witness it in their father. The second option, that they have asserted themselves, seems to be the more likely. This does not mean that they had to be kings or prominently historical figures but it does imply that they had a role which was prestigious within their own community and that they were educated to a higher standard than normal, feeling free to be judgemental. They may even have felt it appropriate to encourage a body of supporters or a movement that would be obliged to keep their identity secret
(if they knew it) but would support and protect them. This
second approach mirror’s the approach of Jesus himself.
If Jesus did have children and he was the legitimate heir to the throne of the Egyptian God-King there does appear to be a
contradiction to his approach. The Egyptian tradition was that
the king’s offspring took the throne. In Jesus case, he
delegated the leadership of the movement (church) he had started to one of his disciples. His children if there were any,
were kept hidden and were not involved. This is perhaps
understandable given Ptolemy XIII’s history of being pursued
and persecuted and of the reactions Jesus provoked from Roman and Hebrew authorities to his own limited attempts to make known his true identity. However, it is difficult to believe that Jesus taught any children to be anonymous in the long term and he perhaps hoped that the movement he had started would engender a culture under whose protection his descendents could re-assert their divine authority. He would not have anticipated that the early development of the Church
would have been affected by the interloper Paul in the manner
it was and that ‘The Church’ would become a body that would



348
never be able to admit Jesus’ true identity without destroying
itself in the process. The Jewish, Christian and later Muslim theologies successfully replaced the religious traditions and beliefs of the Egyptians, the Greeks and eventually the Romans. The Christians became invincible by basing their movement of the fact that their founder had been the incarnate and eternal Son of God who had taken human form. At the same time, they had removed the home of God the Father from a physical
location in the heavens to a mysterious, wonderful and unseen
place called ‘Heaven’. The appearance of someone claiming to be the ‘Son of God’ based on a bloodline from Osiris (via
Jesus) would immediately demolish the philosophical structure upon which the Church has been constructed. If there was a protected bloodline and there was a series of generations in which young offspring were taught of their divine inheritance then one can only surmise that some amongst them might well have made moves towards to the long term re-establishment of themselves and their own descendants in the role of God-King. With each generation, this would have been seen by the incumbent to have been more difficult as the advance of science made their claims seem less and less credible. There would of course have been cause for optimism created by their observations that human beings never cease to be gullible and that in one form or another we continue to cling to a variety of religious concepts and occultist ideas to give us answers to the unknown. For that reason, any success they achieved would have been in a role, which encouraged ritual affirmation to a core of central beliefs.



349
The most obvious role in which these people might have asserted themselves would be to get control of the monarchy of the country or countries where they had influence. In such circumstances, they would have been monarchs who imposed a strong religious ethos as part of his reign. There have been many instances of religious leaders also being kings/rulers during the last two thousand years:
* Certain leaders of Muslim countries have been Imams, or have ruled with the leading religious person of the country concerned as their appointee.
* For a millennia the pope effectively controlled the appointment of Monarchs in many of the Christian countries of Europe
* Several Popes such as the Borgia have ruled Italy or parts of Italy
* Kings and Queens of England who became self appointed heads of the Church of England
It may be, for instance, that the Christian King Merovée, the founder of the Merovingian dynasty in the 5th century CE was of the royal bloodline. There is no evidence for this and there
are many other rulers of countries in Europe and the Middle
East into which Jesus’ family might have emigrated and who
had historical kings that could just as easily have been the God-King we are looking for. At the same time, European history is swamped with stories of battles between conflicting pretenders to the throne, as



350
prominent individuals strove to introduce, impose or retain a ruling Christian dynasty. These have largely been eliminated by the emergence of democracy and by nations separating the inter-relationship between church and state. Since the 8th century, Islam has continued to expand its influence into many countries under the guidance of a large number of local Imams. If the movement was being directed centrally we may have been tempted to ask if it was being orchestrated in favour of an objective of the person in control. As it is not, then it can be eliminated as a place from whence descendants of Jesus might be operating.
Other movements that have emerged and had influence in the 2nd millennium include the very powerful Knights Templar, established following the discovery of a secret cache of information by a small band of French Nobles during the first the 1st crusade (1096 – 1099 CE) and on a subsequent visit in 1104 CE. The Order of the Knights Templar was dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312 CE and was prosecuted out of existence in France where many of its most prominent members were
executed. The Order of Freemasonry appeared in the wake of
the Templar’s elimination and it was probably created by
Templar officials who left France to escape persecution. Freemasonry is still thriving and is evident in those countries whose institutions were established by European invaders and colonists. Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are independent and sovereign bodies that govern Freemasonry in an individual country or geographic area. There is no overarching body that presides over the independent Grand Lodges albeit



351
that the United States has more members than any other Grand Lodge.
The Freemasonry movement is an obvious candidate for one which protects an Ancient Egyptian tradition as it has a secret agenda and openly uses ceremonies and monograms which come directly from that same tradition......
 The five pointed star from its resting place in the cup of Ursa Major
 The eye which replicates the eye of Ra
 Seven stars
 Gods in the sun and the moon
 The columns that are the portals to the temple
The only symbol or item that is common to the Freemasons
and to the Grail Quest is the elusive five-pointed star, referred
to in Parzival as ‘the stone’. Fourteen US Presidents, who are known as ‘leaders of the free world’ have openly declared themselves to be Masons
including, most recently Harry Truman and Gerald Ford. Others (such as George and G W Bush) are accused of being



352
members without any direct evidence. Additionally, it is acknowledged that there are a large number of Freemasons in
all levels of the US administration and of the governments of
most other ‘Western’ style democracies. This membership is
supplemented by influencers in all the other key elements of
each country’s infrastructure and includes bankers, judges and
law enforcement officials.
It is difficult to know what influence these Masons (as a body)
have on the people of ‘the free world’. One would suspect that
any republican/conservative government official who comes from a selected elite and who separates him/her self from ordinary citizens is more likely to be attuned to this group than are incumbents who arrive from a more plebeian
background. It is for this reason that a series of conspiracy
theories have grown up related to the Freemason’s interests and objectives, accusing them of wanting to establish a ‘New World Order’.
In relation to the mindset of those involved in Freemasonry, Jim Shaw, who was awarded the 33rd degree of Freemasonry and who later left the movement reports that;
When asked “Of what religion are you?" He would
normally have answered; "I believe the Ancient Mysteries, the 'Old Religion,' and I believe in reincarnation."
When he decided to leave the Freemasons he thought; "I will never return," I thought with each step. "I will never return, I will never return...."



353
At the moment he made the decision to leave he tells us; “The
decision was made, the die was cast. From that night onward I would serve the true and living God, not the Great Architect of the Universe. I would exalt and learn of Him, not Osiris,
Krishna or Demeter. I would seek and follow Jesus, not the
will-of-the-wisp of "hidden wisdom”.
This brief glimpse shows clearly that the beliefs underpinning Freemasonry and which Jim Shaw rejected in favour of conventional Christianity appear to be closely associated with an Ancient Egyptian philosophy. From that perspective, Freemasonry would seem to be an ideal candidate for a movement designed to protect ancient Egyptian philosophy and maybe, if it exists the sacred Pharaonic bloodline. Perhaps the question that should be asked is; if Freemasonry does not exist to maintain and protect the Ancient Egyptian beliefs and philosophy, what is its underlying purpose? An association designed to promote or protect the interests of it members would never have needed to refer to Ancient Egyptian paraphernalia to achieve their objectives. Since the organisation was itself born in the 14th century CE the rituals and ceremonies that exist today must have been incorporated at that time and it is the maintenance of these rituals that has brought them through undamaged for 6 centuries. It is known that the Knights Templar were accused of and condemned for practising strange rituals and it is perhaps reasonable to assume that the artefacts and rituals of Freemasonry came directly from the traditions that had been constructed by the Knights Templar, out of their discoveries in the Middle East.



354
Why were those rituals established? What was it that was discovered by the Knights Templar and subsequently passed to the Freemasons? Since the 16th century Roman Catholics have been banned from becoming Freemasons and this prohibition has continued until the present time. In the 1985, the U.S. Catholic Conference Bishops' Committee on Pastoral Research and Practices concluded in its letter to American Bishops concerning Masonry that "the principles and basic rituals of Freemasonry embody a naturalistic religion, active participation in which is incompatible with Christian faith and practice." On September 15, 2000, the Reverend Thomas Anslow, Judicial Vicar of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, wrote a letter to David Patterson, Executive Secretary of the Masonic Service Bureau of Los Angeles. In reply to the question; "whether a practicing Catholic may join a Masonic Lodge", Father Anslow said; "at least for Catholics in the United States, I believe the answer is probably yes". This letter was publicly retracted by Father Anslow on February 12, 2002, with the explanation that his analysis was faulty. He said that Freemasonry fostered a "supraconfessional humanitarian" conception of the divine "that neutralizes or replaces the faith dimension of our (Roman Catholic) relationship with God." On March 1, 2007, Archbishop Ginafranco Girotti, the regent of the Apostolic Penitentiary made a statement that membership in Masonic organisations "remains forbidden" to Catholics and he called on priests who had declared themselves to be Freemasons to be disciplined by their direct superiors. This was in reaction to the declaration that the 85



355
year old Italian priest Rosario Francesco Esposito had
declared himself a Freemason, even though he was once
commissioned by the Church to study the Church’s teaching
on masonry. The Catholic Church believes that the route to God is through
the Church and through Jesus. The Freemasonry concept that
there is a direct route to God eliminates the Church’s raison
d’être and because of this, it is small wonder that Freemasonry has been condemned. If there are other more fundamental questions that are at the heart of the conflict, we are not aware of them. However, the ongoing alienation of Freemasonry does imply that the Roman Catholic Church fears this organisation and its impact. Whatever the truth of it, we cannot know if the Freemasonry movement exists to protect a royal bloodline and/or to promote its public re-emergence in any more formal way than may exist at present. All we can say is that if there is such a movement, Freemasonry is the most likely mainstream candidate for the organisation to guard and protect its secret existence.
The fact that we do not know of and cannot specify the location of descendents of Jesus does not invalidate our general hypothesis. During two millennia, there are a myriad of possibilities. However, given the importance of the bloodline, we would expect that it was administered carefully and protected to ensure its continuance.

Chapter 19 The Covenant
Whilst the examinations made here do not confirm the general hypothesis that Jesus was the son of Ptolemy XIII, we have presented strong circumstantial evidence pointing towards the hypothesis being valid and none that proves it to be fallacious.
Three of the gospels do report that Jesus made a
pronouncement regarding his blood at the ‘last supper’. Using
the conventional translation from the Ancient Greek, Luke tells us;
And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My blood. (Luke 22;20)
Even with amendment, it is easy to see that this statement indicates a covenant IN my blood and prompts us to ask what the author was trying to say. In John 16; 26 it is reported that Jesus tells us that he speaks figuratively. This being the case, we must ask ourselves if the extract from Luke (above) is also meant to be figurative. In addition, it is probably worth mentioning that the Greek words in which the original document was written have alternative meanings in English;
The word for ‘cup’ can be translated ‘divine appointment’ or ’lot’



357
The word for ‘covenant’ could be read as ‘will’ or ‘arrangement’ The word for ‘blood’ could be read ‘seat of life’ or ‘essence’ ‘Poured out’ could equally be read ‘bestowed’ ‘For’ can be translated as ‘over’, ‘above’ on ‘on behalf of’
Using the alternative words (and meanings) now we have a translation which reads;
And after this he supped the cup in like
manner saying; “this, the divine appointment,
the arrangement by (means of) the blood of
me, this lot/covenant is bestowed on/over you”.
Here, Jesus was saying that his divinity was an outcome of his inherited blood or the bloodline of which he was a part. For the first time we have direct evidence of a link between the
divine status claimed by Jesus and his blood. His divine status
and his title ‘Son of God’ are only claimed by Jesus because
of his blood. He is acknowledging his place in the Pharaonic bloodline that started with the first god-king Osiris.
In this Luke version of the Last Supper Jesus is also being
magnanimous, in that he is saying that this ‘arrangement by the blood’ is bestowed on his listeners. By implication there is a command here that the ‘arrangement by blood’ be honoured
and protected.
Matthew’s version of the same events contains some
additional words;



358
27 And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you 28 For this is the blood of me, of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins. (Matt 26; 27-28)
He claims that the blood is bestowed/poured out ‘for the forgiveness of sins’ or ‘wanderings from the path of honour.’
Such an addendum is not included in either the Mark or Luke versions and because of that we must either assume that it is embellishment by the author of Matthew or we must look for
a deeper meaning.
The words ‘the blood bestowed/distributed for many for
forgiveness of sins’, can be translated from the Greek to read;
the blood bestowed for many unto/for ‘wanderings from the path of honour’/’violations of the divine law’. This does not
provide a realistic alternative translation and meaning and we
are left therefore with the conclusion that it may well have
been ‘poetic licence’ by the author.
There are certain intriguing elements to the reports of the last supper;
 Though Mathew tells us that the 12 disciples were
present, commentary about the events at ‘the last supper’ is not included in John’s gospel. This is a
significant omission and it provokes one to speculate
whether John’s commentary of the event was edited
from the gospel or the gospel of John was written



359
after the event by an author who was someone other than John.
 Matthew tells us in verse 18 that Jesus said; “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I am to keep the Passover at
your house with my disciples."'" Who is this ‘certain
man’ whose name is carefully omitted?
 Mark’s account of this ‘certain person’ is even more
intriguing; 13 And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, "Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him; 14 and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher says, "Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"' 15 And he himself will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there." (Mar 14; 13-15)
Here we have a person who is wealthy enough to own a large house, who is not known to the disciples, but who is
sufficiently well known to Jesus that he is prepared to give
over his large guest room. He knows Jesus as ‘The Teacher’
and one can only wonder at the relationship between the two and at the ways any relationship had been established. How could Jesus know a wealthy man in Jerusalem unbeknown to his disciples? In what circumstances had they previously met when none of the apostles were not in attendance? Does this organisation and relationship imply a group of people or organisation that were separate to the disciples?



360
Over and above that, there would appear to have been some kind of understanding or arrangement previously made. Had this been made by Jesus and the owner of the house directly or had there been an intermediary? If so, the only obvious intermediary who was a confidante of Jesus and not one of the twelve would have been Mary Magdalene. We showed earlier that there was a possibility that the events surrounding the crucifixion and the resurrection were planned and quite possibly contrived. The above passages indicate conclusively that there was a lot of organisation incorporated into the measures taken immediately preceding those events. It seems that there was nothing that had been unforeseen. The fact that the disciples were not part of these detailed plans points to the possibility that there was some hidden agenda. The circumstances provoke speculation that the apostles were
encouraged to believe in the crucifixion and resurrection in
order that they would have the zeal to prosecute ‘the Lord’s message’. Strangely, the apostles were, in the most part,
absent from the death and the subsequent resurrection of Jesus and because of that the stage was left available for the implementation of any subterfuge. Hidden confidantes of Jesus and Mary Magdalene might have included Joseph of Arimathea, the wealthy member of the council who interceded to have Jesus body taken down from
the cross. According to Mark, only he, Mary Magdalene and
Mary the mother of Jesus ‘saw where Jesus was laid’ and they
were most likely to have been parties to any deception. The
field was certainly wide open for Jesus death and resurrection
to have been contrived. The fact that Jesus appears ‘in the flesh’ to the disciples and shows himself to be a mortal human



361
being after his reported death and so called resurrection would seem to add credence to this possibility. If Jesus did not die, he had created the opportunity to disappear along with Mary Magdalene and maybe accompanied by or with the help of Joseph of Arimathea. In this scenario, we have the beginnings of an organisation to protect Jesus and his children and to keep all of their identities hidden.
The people of the Egyptian Empire had been defeated and
overcome by the Jews, the Greeks and the Romans. They had
moved away from the #path of righteousness’. Only the blood
of the Pharaonic line could bring back honour and truth and forgiveness for this horrendous wrong.



362
Conclusion
We have not proved that Jesus was the son of Ptolemy XIII. However, this analysis finds no facts or obstacles that would disprove such a hypothesis. On balance we believe that it is a real possibility. More than that, if there is to be a rational explanation of the Jesus story that does not call on mysticism
and divine intervention to explain it, it is probably the only
credible explanation. It would explain Jesus’ conception and
life as portrayed in the gospels and perhaps more importantly, Jesus’ belief that he was of divine heritage and that this heritage was based on blood. As to the maintenance and perpetuation of the lineage, we have no information that points directly to any person or organisation that might be involved with such a well planned and covert operation. The only organisation that fits the obvious profile of protector of the Pharaonic sacred beliefs and maybe protector of the sacred bloodline is Freemasonry why else do Freemasons do what they do?
If there is a person alive who is the descendant of Jesus he or she is not making it obvious and to that extent, it could be argued that if the Freemasons are members of an organisation that has been created to hide the truth they have done a
remarkably good job. The order of Freemasons is known to be
a society/organisation with ‘secrets’. If one puts, ‘freemasons, secrets’ into the Google search engine, it offers as an
alternative sub-heading; freemason’s secrets revealed. This is
nonsense of course since a secret is something that isn’t
revealed. Anything that is revealed is no longer a secret.



363
No one will ever know the real truth. It is for this reason that
the mantra of; ‘it’s a matter of faith’ will be a convincing
argument for devout Christians. Whatever the truth of it, the followers of Jesus Christ were extremely successful in
building an organisation to promote their belief that Jesus was
the ‘Son of God’ incarnate who took human form and was
crucified to atone for the sins of mankind. Though fantastic in any sense of the word, this reading of the Jesus story and the message that Jesus’ disciples proselytised down the ages is unlikely but may be true and valid.
Here we have presented an alternative explanation: Jesus was
the son of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII and by
Egyptian tradition held the title; ‘Son of God’. He was born to
perpetuate the Royal and divine bloodline from Osiris and to consolidate an imperial dynasty. He may even have believed, based on what he had been told that he was divine. In this scenario, those helping to protect and secretly ensure the
perpetuation of this bloodline believed that they would be
rewarded when they died and they joined ‘God’ in Heaven.
Those who proselytise Jesus and his teachings have kept his true identity hidden. It is possible that they were never told the truth but in their portrayal of Jesus’ conversations they betrayed much of what he had been taught of his role and of
its implications. Jesus even admitted that to understand him,
one needed to ‘read between the lines’.
Jesus ministry was consolidated by the contrivance of His death and resurrection, which was executed in a manner that it fooled many of those close to him. So convinced were they that they felt energised to preach the message that they



364
sincerely believed they had been given, whilst the truth was hidden and suppressed.
The alternative is that the disciples of Jesus knew and
understood Jesus’ real identity and that they deliberately
connived to promote the divine attributes he was deemed to possess as God-King in the Pharaonic bloodline that linked directly to Osiris. It is impossible to prove that any of these scenarios was the true one. Devout Christian believers are blinded by their faith from consideration of another logical alternative. In many
cases their world would collapse if they were persuaded to
believe that Jesus is not the living ‘Son of God’ who through
congregation exists to protect them, forgive them and give them solace. Others, who may be interested to consider alternative explanations, have little real evidence to help them. All we can offer here is an alternative possibility that seems to fit the facts as they have been recorded.
When we look back at the ancient Egyptians, we see people who we judge to have been deluded in their adoration of what seems to have been a fanciful portrayal of God in his/her many aspects. However, it is important to remember that the people of that time were as sincere in their beliefs as are Christians today. Over the five thousand years that have passed since Egyptian records were made, scientists have shown that the stars and the patterns they make are not gods and that the astronomical deductions that were made in the earliest of times led priest astronomers to reach ill-founded conclusions.



365
In the future, quantum physicists will help us find information about reality and our perceptions of it that may change our view regarding the infinite controlling intelligence that we know as God. From our position of relative ignorance, we can only guess what their history of the 21st century and its religious beliefs will be.

Gematria/ Isopsephia
The practice of giving each letter of the alphabet a numerical value was first practiced in the wider Mesopotamian area
a
. Each letter had a value and therefore each word had the value which was the sum of the values of the letters in the word. At that time all the Gods had numbers, which Simo Parpola
b
has shown to be numerically related by the Assyrian Tree of Life.). For example, Sargon (d.705 BCE) states that the perimeter of his palace at Khorsabad (16283 cubits) was equal to his name.
This practice was in common use in Babylon in the 8
th
Century BCE and was further developed in Greece under the influence of Pythagoras (circa 500 BC) where is was known as Isopsephia (equal (to) the

So, (for example) Zeus is the Geometric Mean of Hermes and Apolloc This common use is an indication that the science was developed earlier than this and may have been a key to the development of alphabets in the Middle East. The Hebrew Gematria came from the Greeks. It is claimed that textual specialists, Soferim (counters), were specialists in Gematria and that they used their skill to ensure that the scriptures and torah were replicated without error.
