Unicorn on Ishtar gate is ornament gold, Mušḫuššu is ironwork; both are Indus Script hypertexts wealthsignifiers
-- Unicorn on Ishtar gate is Indus Script hypertext kunda singi 'horned young bull' rebus fine gold, ornament gold; this set the Gold standard seen on Lydia electrum coin; Mušḫuššu is ironwork
-- Kudurru symbols, symbols on Ishtar gate and remembered memories of Indus Script hypertexts of metalwork wealth accounting
One panel of the sculptural friezes on Shalamanesher Black Obelisk shows uniquely horned bovines. One has two horns, one has a single horn and the third has a double-lion-sickle adapted from the iconography of Early Dynastic II period (c. 2750-2600 BCE). These can be viewed as recollected memories of Indus Script Cipher hypertexts: dhangar 'bull' rebus: dhangar 'blacksmith' PLUS horns of zebu: poḷa 'zebu' rebus: poḷa 'magnetite, ferrite ore' PLUS dhatu 'scarf' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ores'; kunda singi 'young bull horned' rebus: kunda singi 'fine gold, gold for ornaments'; ranku 'antelope' rebus: ranku 'tin' PLUS double-lionsickle: arye 'lion' rebus: āra 'brass' PLUS dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS katti 'sickle' rebus: khātī 'wheelwright'. The horns signify: koḍ 'horns' rebus: koḍ 'workshop'. Thus, a repertoire of workshops with artisans working in iron, fine gold, ornament gold, tin and metal alloys.
These rebus renderings explain why the three animal compositions are listed as 'tributes from workshops of Muśiri' by Shalamanesher II on the cuneiform inscription. Muśiri has been identified as Kurdistan (where Yazidi practice Hindu traditions of wearing tilak on their foreheads even today).

The animals exhibited by Nebudanezzar on Ishtar gate are traceable to the descriptions recorded in 3rd millennium BCE. For examples, Aurochs (Bos primigenius) is identified in"Texts as early as the Early Dynastic II period (c. 2750-2600 BCE) describe Marduk as the “bull-calf” of the sun god, Shamash (UTU)."
I submit that many symbols on Kudurrus of 2nd millennium BCE from sites of Ancient Near East are recollected, remembered memories of Indus Script hypertexts of metalwork wealth accounting. This explains why the Ishtar Gate dramatically displays 'unicorns', 'lions'
and Mušḫuššu (composite animal). Composite animals as hypertexts is the hall-mark Indus Script Cipheer; each hieroglyph component is part of a hypertext message related to wealthaccounting ledgers of metalwork, lapidary work with gems and jewels. The most frequent artisanal activity relates to working with fine gold and gold for ornaments signified by the 'onehorned young bull', the so-called 'unicorn'.
The monograph presents arguments to explain the Ishtar Gate Indus Script hypertexts of unicorns', 'lions' and Mušḫuššu (composite animal).
"The Ishtar Gate (Arabic: بوابة عشتار ) was the eighth gate to the inner city of Babylon.It was constructed in about 575 BCE by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II on the north side of the city. It was part of a grand walled processional way leading into the city. The walls were finished in glazed bricks mostly in blue, with animals and deities in low relief at intervals, these also made up of bricks that are molded and colored differently." The gates are now seen in Berlin’s Pergamon Museum. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishtar_Gate
From the inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II on the gate constructed ca. 605–562 BCE :
"I placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendor so that Mankind might gaze on them in wonder.
I let the temple of Esiskursiskur, the highest festival house of Marduk, the lord of the gods, a place of joy and jubilation for the major and minor deities, be built firm like a mountain in the

precinct of Babylon of asphalt and fired bricks." (Marzahn, Joachim (1981). Babylon und das Neujahrsfest. Berlin: Berlin : Vorderasiatisches Museum. pp. 29–30.)

"It appears that the choice of a particular being portrayed on a given object could be influenced by factors such as its owner’s profession, religious and/or political affiliations, and especially by the apotropaic function(s) of specific composite beings...several Mesopotamian (including Babylonian and Assyrian) kings were characterized as apkallu, implying that they were sources of creativity, wisdom, and power to sustain and protect their subjects.
" (Constance Ellen Gane, Composite Beings in Neo-Babylonian Art, Doctoral Dissertation, University of California at Berkeley, 2012, p. 1, p.20).https://laplacamadre.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/apkallu-composite-beings-in-neobabylonian-art.pdf.
Three cylinder seals, one stamp seal and two stamp impressions on tablets provide glyptic examples of the ūmu-apkallu (Ills. 2.1-2.6).
"Cylinder seal VA 7738 from Babylon (Ill. 2.2) depicts a striding, four-winged human apkallu facing right, with his right hand raised before a central tree. On the right and facing left toward the tree is a bearded, human-headed two-winged lion, slightly rampant toward the tree. Above the wing of this sphinx is a crescent moon. Behind the apkallu is a pedestal consisting of six vertical posts. A marru (spade-standard of Marduk) and double-wedged stylus (symbol of Nabu) surmount the pedestal.52 Above the marru and stylus is an eightpointed star. The scene has an awkward distribution in that none of the figures or the pedestal base are on the baseline, but rather appear to float in the air. " (CGane, 2012, opcit., p.26) Illustration 2.2.

"A worship scene on cylinder seal CBS 14366 from Nippur (Ill. 2.3) has two figures oriented to the left. On the left of the scene, a nude four-winged apkallu reaches forward to grasp the marru spade-standard of Marduk in one hand, while lifting his other hand over it. He has long hair, a beard, and a fillet about his head. Behind the apkallu is a bearded, two-winged human-headed lion that strides toward a tall emblem, perhaps the stylus of Nabu." (ibid.)

"Two stamp seal impressions, BM 56251 and BM 66789 (Ills. 2.5-2.6), on tablets from Sippar show the four-winged ūmu-apkallu in profile facing to the left. In both examples, the arms are in the typical apkallu gesture with one arm raised and one arm lowered. The scenes are only partially preserved and do not include the hands." (ibid.) Human apkallu in same posture as on fish apkallu. "The ritual behavior, including orientation and stance, of the provenanced NB human ūmuapkallu are typical of apkallu-type beings: He
stands in profile and raises one forearm; the palm of his hand is oriented downward, and with it he usually grasps a mullilu cone or sprinkler.47 His other hand is lowered and usually holds a banduddû bucket."

Like the fish-apkallu discussed under nos. 67-72, the humanapkallu, carrying the same implements, also performs purification or exorcism rites. The apkallu is clad in a slit-robe with no kilt beneath it. While it is not common, human-apkallu can minister to cultic objects in first millennium glyptic. The impression recalls no. 212, showing a Mischwesen tending to a spade-standard” (Ehrenberg, Uruk, 27).

Fish-cloaked apkallu
"The fish-cloaked apkallu is part human and part purādu-fish, “carp.” He has a human body and a bearded human face, with a fish head on top of his human head. The rest of the fish’s body, with caudal and dorsal fins, hangs down his back. His legs and feet can be those of a goat or bull. Combining human intelligence with human and fish capabilities of terrestrial and aquatic survival and locomotion, the supernatural being is amphibious, with access both to the dry land and to the watery Apsu. " (opcit., pp.36-37)

10
previous section on ūmu-apkallu, it seems appropriate that apkallu figures, in this case the fishapkallu, have a significant presence in scenes on seals belonging to temple officials." (opcit., p.39) "In tablet I of the eighth-century-BC Babylonian myth Erra and Ishum, Marduk laments
regarding the apkallu: “Where are the Seven Sages of the Apsu, the holy carp, who are perfect in lofty wisdom like Ea their lord, who can make my body holy?...Neo-Babylonians continued to venerate mythical fish sages, who conveyed the basic arts of civilization to the human race. The fish-cloaked apkallu are integrally connected with the divine Ea, god of the Apsu and of wisdom.” (ibid., p.40, p.42)
The bovine
bull-man,
Early Dynastic II - Achaemenid, kusarikku "bison(-man)" originally associated with the sun-god Shamash
"The so-called wild bull that roamed ancient Mesopotamia was probably identified by the Sumerian term GUD4.ALIM and the Akkadian kusarikku. 1 The wild cattle of the ancient Near East may have been aurochs (Bos primigenius, Ill. 4.1), which are now extinct, but were the probable ancestors of all modern cattle.2 The aurochs was an impressive beast, standing over six



11
feet tall at the shoulder and armed with enormous horns.3 Alternatively, some scholars believe that the ancient wild cattle were more likely bison or wisent (Bison bison caucasicus).4 The wild bovine was portrayed in Mesopotamian iconography since pre-historic times (pre3500 BC) in natural, mythological, and religious contexts.5 Depictions of this natural animal are found in the round, in relief, and in glyptic art well into the Achaemenid period." (ibid., p.67)
Illustration 4.1. Natural bovine: Aurochs (Bos primigenius) "Texts as early as the Early Dynastic II period (c. 2750-2600 BCE) describe Marduk as the “bull-calf” of the sun god, Shamash
(UTU). In the Old Babylonian period, the crescent moon could be understood as the horns of a bull that functions as the attribute animal of Sin (NANNA-SUEN).The natural bull is associated with storm deities as early as the Old Babylonian period, and possibly earlier.8 The bull especially functions as the attribute animal of the storm god Adad (ISHKUR). Roiling
thunderclouds are referred to as the “bull-calves” of ISHKUR. 9 Bovines are often found in the same contexts as aspects of storms connected with the storm god, such as forked lightning bolts and thunderclouds...Nebuchadnezzar II records in the so-called East India House Inscription (III:36-64) discovered in Babylon (BM 129397) how he elaborately adorns the cellas of Nabu and Sin (here referred to as Nana) in the Ezida temple at Borsippa. Twice he mentions bulls in connection with gates:" (ibid., pp.68-70).
"36. Borsippa the city of his abode 37. I beautified, and 38. Ezida, the Eternal House, 39. in the midst thereof I made. 40. With silver, gold, precious stones, 45. copper, mismakanna-wood, cedar-wood, 42. I finished the work of it. 43. The cedar of the roofing 44. of the cells of Nebo 45. with gold I overlaid. 46.

Ball in Records of the Past: Being Translations of the Ancient Monuments of Egypt and Western Asia (ed. A. H. Sayce; 2d ser., London: Bagster & Sons, 1890), 110, II:38-65 [cited 24 May 2012] Online: http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/rp/rp203/rp20325.htm.
Later in the same inscription (V:56-VI:21), Nebuchadnezzar describes his construction work in Babylon and his embellishment of that capital city. Here he fabricates bulls and “dreadful serpents” of bronze, and stations them at the gates of the city walls (called Imgur-bel and Nimetti-bel) to make the entrance “unapproachable” to any incursion of evil: Column V 56. Of



12
Imgur-bel 57. and Nimitti-bel 58. the portals, on both sides, 59. through the raising 60. of the causeway of Babylon 61. had become low 62. in their entries: 63. those portals 64. I pulled down, and Column VI 1. over against the water their foundation 2. with bitumen and burnt brick 3. I firmly laid, and 4. with burnt brick (and) gleaming uknû stone, 5. whereof bulls and dreadful serpents 6. were made, the interior of them 7. cunningly I constructed. 8. Strong cedar beams 9. for the roofing of them 10. I laid on. 11. Doors of cedar 12. (with) plating of bronze, 13. lintels and hinges, 14. copper-work, in its gates 15. I set up. 16. Strong bulls of copper, 17. and dreadful serpents, standing upright, 18. on their thresholds I erected: 19. those portals, 20. for the gazings of the multitude of the people, 21. with carven work I caused to be filled. 22. As an outwork 2 for Imgur-bel, 23. the wall of Babylon, unapproachable. (loc.cit., ibid., p.69)
"A second royal inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II (CBS 9), known as the “University Museum Cylinder,” describes in elaborate detail the bronze bulls “clothed” in gold and bulls made of silver that he placed at the Ezida temple in Borsippa (col. I): (36) In Borsippa I restored Ezida the righteous house beloved of Marduk for Nabu the illustrious son . . . (52) As for the six rooms adjoining the shrine of Nabu I adorned their cedar roof with bright silver . . . (55) I fabricated huge bulls in bronze and I clothed them with a coating of gold and adorned them with precious stones and I placed them on the threshold of the shrine gate. The threshold, the fetter, the bar, the doorwings, the lintel, the knob(?), the lock, the bolt of the shrine gate I plated with shining gold. . . (60) I covered with clear silver the cedar wood of the roof of the Dara gate through which goes and comes the son of the lord of the gods . . . (62) I fabricated huge bulls of silver and I placed them on its threshold. This gate where through goes and comes the son of the lord of the gods Nabu, when he rides in procession into Babylon, I let shine like the day. . . (65) Bulls of shining silver I planted as ornament on the threshold of the gates of Ezida.14 In the same text, the Babylonian monarch states that he put monumental bronze bulls at the gates of Babylon (II:1-2): (1) In Babylon the city of the great lord Marduk I completed the great walls Imgur-Bel and Nimitti-Bel. (2) On the threshold of their gates I placed huge bronze bulls and dread inspiring dragons.15 Bull imagery in extant NB iconography is best exemplified in relief on the walls of the famous Ishtar Gate at the entrance of sixth-century-BC Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar II
describes the construction of this structure in his “Dedicatory Inscription” on a glazed brick
panel of the gate: Both gate entrances of Imgur-Ellil and Nemetti-Ellil following the filling of the street from Babylon had become increasingly lower. Therefore, I pulled down these gates and laid their foundations at the water-table with asphalt and bricks and had them made of bricks with blue stone on which wonderful bulls and dragons were depicted. I covered their roofs by laying majestic cedars length-wise over them. I hung doors of cedar adorned with bronze at all the gate openings. I placed wild bulls and ferocious dragons in the gateways and thus adorned them with luxurious splendor so that people might gaze on them in wonder.16 The colossal guardian bulls and dragons in the round from the Ishtar Gate have not survived, but those rendered in glazed-brick relief are preserved and exhibited at the Vorderasiatisches Museum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (e.g., Ill. 4.2). Remnants of unglazed reliefs from the gate structure remain in situ in Babylon." (ibid., pp. 69-71)

"The bull-man takes over the name of the natural bovine: Sumerian GUD4.ALIM, the Akkadian equivalent of which is kusarikku. 21 The kusarikku is solidly attested in the NeoBabylonian period on two cylinder seals (Ills. 4.3-4.4), five seal impressions (Ills. 4.5-4.9), and on the Sungod Tablet Collection, which consists of a tablet and two plaster casts of the head of this tablet, which were placed within a lidded coffer (Ills. 4.10-4.13).

"The bull-man is extant in iconography by the Early Dynastic II period as the protector of flocks and herds. In glyptic art of this period, bull-men appear in contest scenes, whether depicted alone, in pairs, or in threes as they struggle against wild animals or humans. Early Dynastic III period (c. 2600-2300 BC) glyptic scenes portray the bull-man fighting Lahmu, the hero with curls. This contest became the most common theme of Akkadian period (c. 2330-2190 BC) glyptic art. Also on Akkadian period seals, the bull-man is shown as an adversary to the sun god, UTU: With rebellious mountain gods, he fought against UTU, who was the supervisor of the distant regions, along with INANNA. However, during the Akkadian period, the bull-man’s association with UTU is transformed into a master-servant relationship, so he becomes a protective figure at significant entrances...The NB bull-man continued functions exhibited in earlier periods. These include guarding against intrusion by malevolent forces and attending the sun god Shamash by supporting his throne and winged disk. Because Shamash is the god of justice, the bull-man plays a subordinate role in the administration of justice.60 Additionally, the bull-man can be associated with an apkallu, who performs a purification ritual in what appears to be a judicial context.

Illustration 5.2. Lion. NB glazed brick relief: VA Bab 4765 (Ishtar Gate, Babylon)
"The best-known lion imagery in NB iconography is on the magnificent glazed brick reliefs lining the Processional Way and on the throne room façade of the Southern Palace in



15
sixthcentury-BC Babylon (Ill. 5.2). In both of these locations, rows of natural lions stride in profile, emphasizing their apotropaic function. Thus, on the outer façade flanking the entrance to the throne room from the Central Court, the lions stride from the left and from the right toward the entrance through which an individual must pass to reach the king on his throne. On the reliefs lining the Processional Way, the lions pace northward, away from the Ishtar Gate and toward anyone approaching it. (Joachim Marzahn, The Ishtar Gate: The Processional Way: The New Year Festival of Babylon (Mainz: Zabern, 1994), 9.)(opcit., pp.94-95)

It is most notably the standard of Ishtar and supports her star The emblem is less frequently associated with Ningirsu. It is additionally attested as the standard of Nergal and Zababa.20 Since these four deities are warlike, it is not surprising that d Urigallu is closely associated with scenes of war in iconography." (ibid. p.97)
Occasionally in NeoBabylonian iconography, a divine lion-headed emblem, depicting only the head of a natural lion on a sickle, surmounts an altar in a scene of worship (Ills. 5.3-5.4). In both of the extant provenanced examples, the lion sickle appears in front of a worshiper, whose right hand is raised in adoration. Also in both, there is an oblong object on a second altar, surmounted by a crescent, between the worshiper and the lion sickle. Illustration 5.3. Lion sickle.

His lowered right hand holds a scimitar. The mušḫuššu, recumbent at his feet, has two prominent horns and ears, a curled and hissing tongue, and is covered with a heavy coat of scales. Along the dragon’s neck is a mane. Both the deity and the creature are supported by a plinth evoking water, presumably representing the Apsu, which reflects the close connection between Marduk, the mušḫuššu, and the sea....a single stylus of Nabu on the back of a mušḫuššu is common.(ibid., pp.208-210).
"The overall picture shows a vast and variegated cosmic community inhabited by many kinds of beings and creatures, including gods, subdivine supernatural beings (including demons, monsters, and dragons), humans, and animals (including fish and birds)." (Ibid., p.227).
What are kudurrus?
Kudurrus are stelas or stone (or clay) slabs (called nargus or asumittu, "inscribed slab," and abnu, "stone." by the Babylonians) with inscriptions, generally of land grants, boundary markers. Ignace Gelb et al detailt the functions of the kudurrus as documents of land tenure systems of the Bronze Age. [Ignace Gelb, Piotr Steinkeller, and Robert Whiting Jr., 1991, Earliest Land Tenure Systems in the Near East: Ancient Kudurrus by Ignace Gelb, Piotr Steinkeller, and Robert Whiting Junior (1989-1991, 2 Parts: Part 1: Text, Part 2: Plates)].
Giorgio Buccellati details field and/or temple placement of kudurrus. (Giorgio Buccellati, 1994, The Kudurrus as Monuments in: Cinquante-deux reflexions sur le Proche-Orient ancien offertes en hommage a Leon de Meyer, Pages 283-291).

Brinkman provides an economic interpretation that kudurrus were not legal documents - but mere commemoration/markers of the acquisition of land (perpetual income). (John Brinkman, 2006, Babylonian royal land grants, memorials of financial interest, and invocation of the divine, in: Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient [JESHO], Volume 49, 2006, Pages 1-47).
Indus Script hieroglyphs on Kassite hypertexts on kudurrus are sacred memories of Bronze Age artisanal activities Mirror: https://tinyurl.com/y9umwwld With this background of links between Syria/Kassites with Indo-Aryan, it is instructive to find many Indus Script hieroglyphs on Kassite kudurrus.
Examples of Kassite kudurru hypertexts deploying Indus Script hieroglyphs are presented in this monograph.

Kudurru recording Eanna-shum-iddina's land grant, British
Museum. Eanna-shum-iddina was a governor in the Sealand Dynasty of Babylon in the middle of the second millennium BC. Sealand was the region of southern Iraq, of the Tigris-Euphrates(Mesopotamia) along the coast. Eanna-shum-iddina is known to have made at least one Kudurruboundary stone. The "Eanna-shum-iddina kudurru" was a land grant to Gula-eresh, witnessed by his surveyor Amurru-bel-zeri. The British Museum dates this kudurru to 1125-1100 BC:
Walters Art Museum no. 2110 kudurru A "kudurru," the Akkadian term
for boundary stone, combines images of the king, gods, and divine symbols with a text recording



23
royal grants of land and tax exemption to an individual. While the original was housed in the temple, a copy of the document was kept at the site of the land in question. This example was found at the temple of Esagila, the primary sanctuary of the god Marduk. The king Marduknadin-ahe is depicted with his left hand raised in front of his face; he wears the tall Babylonian feathered crown and an elaborately decorated garment with a honeycomb pattern. On the top are a sun disk, star, crescent moon, and scorpion, representing deities who witnessed the land grant and tax exemption. A snake-dragon deity emerges from a row of altars shaped like temple façades along the back.

This magnificent object is a Kudurru, a carved stone used to mark a royal land grant. Old books call them "boundary stones", but they were kept in the palace or temple archives, not placed out on the borders of the grant. This one comes from Babylon, the Second Dynasty of Isin, 11571025 BC; I found it in an online exhibit at the California Museum of Ancient Art.
This stone is carved of black limestone, 16.5 inches tall (42 cm). The designs are full of significance. On the front: the Mesopotamian pantheon is presented. The four great gods come first. Anu ("father of the gods" and god of heaven) and Enlil (god of wind, kingship and the earth), are shown as a multihorned divine crown each on its own temple facade. Then Ea (god of water, magic and wisdom), is shown as a curved stick ending in a ram's head atop a temple facade pulled by the foreparts of a horned goat. Above the first two deities, a female headdress in the shape of an omega sign, symbolizes Ninhursag ("mother of the gods" and goddess of fertility).

26
Reverse: The leading Babylonian god, Marduk, and his son Nabu, appear next. A triangular spade pointing up and a scribe's wedge-shaped stylus, respectively, each sits atop a temple facade pulled by the foreparts of a snake-dragon known as a Mushus. All five temple facades float on fresh, underground waters known as the Apsu or the Deep. Following these divinities, we find the mace, perhaps a local war god, the scepter with double lion heads of Ninurta (god of war), the arrow, a symbol of the star Sirius, and the two-pronged lightning bolt of Adad. This storm god is called by the similar name Haddad in the Levant. The running bird Papsukkal (minister of the gods, associated with the constellation Orion), is followed by the scorpion Ishara (goddess of oaths), the seated dog Gula (goddess of healing) and a bird on a perch, symbolizing both Shuqamuna and Shumalia (patron deities of the Kassite royal family).



27
Top: The top of the kudurru, representing the heavens, is surrounded and enclosed by the body of a large snake. Nirah (the snake god) encompasses four astral deities the crescent moon of Sin (the moon god), a multi-rayed circular sun disc of Shamash (the sun god), a star inside a disc for Ishtar (the goddess of love -especially sexuality- and war) and the lamp of Nusku (the god of fire and light). Ishtar, considered the most important Mesopotamian female deity, is associated with the morning and evening star, the planet Venus.

Mesopotamian Black Limestone Kudurru Mesopotamia; Second Dynasty of Isin, 1157-1025 BC; Height 16.5 inchesThe upper section of this finely polished black limestone kudurru is decorated in intricately carved raised relief with symbols and sacred animals representing a large group or "gathering" of Mesopotamian gods and goddesses. Kudurrus, sometimes referred to as "boundary markers," were actually land grant documents used by kings to reward their favored servants. These monuments were set up in temples to record royal land grants. The full force of the Mesopotamian pantheon was utilized both to witness and guarantee the land grant by carving the symbols and sacred animals of the deities on the kudurru. In the shape of a cylindrical ovoid, this particular kudurru was not inscribed, perhaps because the person who was to receive the land grant died before it could be

finalized, or because the king changed his mind and decided not to make the land grant after all. Each kudurru is unique; a good deal of variation exists in the number and choice of deities which appear. Front:On this standing monument, the Mesopotamian pantheon is presented.

NOTE: The Indus Script expression
kole.l
which signifies a temple is significant. Since
kole.l
is a smithy, forge', the activities related to metalwork gain sacredness and veneration as products realized in a temple. Hence, the Kassite kudurrus equate metalwork hieroglyphs and express veneration of ancestors who were metalworkers with divinities (as signified on the hieroglyphs used on kudurrus). The divinities for Kassites are:
(1) Anu, (2) Enlil, (3) Ea, (4) Ninmakh, (5) Sin, (6) Nabu, (7) Gula, (8) Ninib, and (9) Marduk.
