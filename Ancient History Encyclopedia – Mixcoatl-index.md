Mixcoatl
Definition
Mark Cartwright
Mixcoatl, 'Cloud Serpent,' was a Mesoamerican god identified with
hunting, the Milky Way and the stars and heavens in general. The
god may originally have derived from a deified hunter and warrior
leader of the Toltec-Chichimec peoples of central Mexico. In
mythology, he is the father of the southern constellations and the
great Mesoamerican god Quetzalcoatl.
Name & Associations
The name Mixcoatl may be literally translated as 'Cloud Serpent'
which is how the ancient Mesoamericans imagined the Milky Way in
the night sky. Mixcoatl was the son of the primordial creator gods
Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl in some traditions; in others, he
was the son of the earth goddess Itzpapalotl ('Obsidian Butterfly')
while his wife was Coatlicue ('Serpent Skirt'), another earth-fertility
goddess. Mixcoatl was considered the father of the Centzon
Huitznahua, the 400 sons representing the southern stars. Also, by
changing himself into a deer and forcing his attentions on either the
great huntress Chimalman or the earth goddess Cihuacoatl, he was
parent to Quetzalcoatl, the great feathered serpent god of
Mesoamerica.
Mixcoatl may be literally translated as 'Cloud
Serpent' which is how the ancient
Mesoamericans imagined the Milky Way.



Mixcoatl was the patron or main god of the Chichimecs (and many
other peoples who claimed descent from them) and the Otomi of
central Mexico. As Camaxtl he was especially worshipped at
Huejotzingo and Tlaxcala. The later Aztecs largely replaced Mixcoatl
with their own powerful sun and war god Huitzilopochtli, although he
was associated with Red Tezcatlipoca, an aspect of the all-seeing
and omnipresent supreme god of the Aztec pantheon Tezcatlipoca.
In one tradition Tezcatlipoca transformed himself into Mixcoatl and
then invented the fire-drill for the benefit of humanity. Finally,
Mixcoatl was associated with lightning, thunder, and the direction
North.
Festivals & Worship
Mixcoatl the god was associated with the 14th Aztec month,
Quecholli (a type of bird), when feasts and hunts were held in his
honour on Mt. Zacatepetl. The hunters dressed themselves as the
god, made arrows, and set ritual fires to commemorate this gift. It
was during this festival that women took their young children to
dance with Mixcoatl's priestesses, who were given cakes. Bloody
human sacrifices were made to the god, too, described here by the
historian M. E. Miller:
A man and a woman were sacrificed to Mixcoatl in his temple. The
female victim was slain like a wild animal; her head was struck
against a rock until she was half-conscious; then her throat was
slit and the head decapitated. The male victim displayed the head
to the assembled crowds before he himself was sacrificed by
heart extrusion. (116)
Mixcoatl, along with various other hunting gods and Tezcatlipoca,
was also honoured during the 5th month of Toxcatl ('Drought') with a
festival which included another round of actual animal hunts and a



staged hunt of prisoners of war dressed as deer. Feasts and the
sacrifice of honoured god-impersonators rounded off the festivities.
Toltec Warrior Columns
The Toltec Mixcoatl
Something like Hercules in Greek mythology, Mixcoatl was perhaps
originally an ordinary mortal who gained fame, and as a great hunter,
warrior, and leader, consequently earned his deification. The Toltec
Civilization flourished between the 10th and mid-12th century CE in
central Mexico, and according to tradition, their legendary chieftain
Ce Tecpatl Mixcoatl ('One Flint Cloud Serpent') led them from the
deserts of the north-west to Culhuacan in the Valley of Mexico.
Mixcoatl, by impregnating with an arrow his wife, a local Nahua
woman named Chimalman, had a son, Ce Acatl Topiltzin who was
born on the day 1 Reed, either 935 or 947 CE. Topiltzin took on the
honorary title Quetzalcoatl and won great renown as he consolidated
and expanded the Toltec-Chichimeca empire with its impressive



capital at Tollan.
Representation in Art
The god is represented on the gilded handle of an Aztec hardwood
dart thrower (atl-atl) now in the British Museum, London. Here he
wears a fanged mask, ear-spools in the form of deer hooves, and an
eagle-feather headdress while battling a rattlesnake. Mixcoatl
appears in codices wearing red and white striped body paint, a black
mask on the upper part of his face, and eagle feathers. As with other
star-associated gods, he may have stars on his face. He is typically
carrying a bow, bunch of arrows, and a hunting net or basket and is
sometimes in the act of slaying a jaguar, reminding of his role as
patron of hunters.
