Significance of तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā as a trade center for
wealth creation and the imperative of re-establishing
Takṣaśilā University for शित्त -िरीर ‘Consciousness’
researches based on Yoga, आयुष् Medicine knowledge
systems
This monograph demonstrates the continuum of Indus Script hieroglyphs on artifacts related to तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā, an archaeological attestation of links with Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.
This monograph recommends that study of knowledge systems related to medicine, in particular, the unexplored frontier knowledge system of ‘consciousness’ or brain-body शित्त
िरीर interface be restored in a rejuvenated तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā University. This frontier
discipline of knowledge is encapsulated in the Cosmic Dance ताांडव नृांत्य which adorns CERN, Switzerland. The bronze statue is made in the same technique called cire perdue (lost-wax casting) which was used in Sarsvati-Sindhu Civilization to produce the exquisite Indus Script hieroglyphs of dance-steps of two women carrying a lamp.

Thus, I submit that the double-headed temple in Sirkap, Takshasila signifies a thunderbolt making blackmithy. The niches are like torana's (gateways of Bharhut/Sanchi) topped by the double-headed eagles.

In a note on Ancient History, the Taksha Institute website notes: “The designation “Taksha” symbolizes the abiding ideals of solid and deep-rooted respect for teachers, unfettered freedom of thought, learning of different streams of knowledge, excellence in education, and extraordinary discipline, that prevailed at the ancient University.”

“Some scholars date Takshashila’s existence back to the 8th century BCE. It was known as a center of learning at least several centuries before Christ, and continued to attract students from around the ancient world until its destruction in the 5th century CE. At ancient Takshashila University, 10,500 students (two out of three applicants rejected) came from within India and outside (Babylonia-now Iraq, Greece, Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor-now Turkey, Arabia, and China), to be taught by nearly 2000 master-teachers. The curriculum consisted of some 68 elective courses, including philosophy, law, state-craft, defense, warfare strategies, grammar (several languages), the 18 arts (music, dance, fine arts, etc.), mathematics, astronomy, astrology, plants & herbs, medicine (Ayurveda, Ayurvedic acupuncture, etc.), and surgery. Some of these, such as medicine, were taught for up to seven years before graduation.Takshashila’s famous researchers and teachers include: Panini (the great grammarian of Sanskrit, to whom Prof. Noam Chomsky of MIT attributes the origin of linguistics); Kautilya, also known as Chanakya (king-maker, astute political advisor, and author of ArthaShastra, c. 300 BCE, deemed by social and economic historian Max Weber as one of the greatest political state-craft books of the ancient world); Charaka (the distinguished physician, whose research on the region’s flora and fauna described in his CharakaSamhita strengthened the development of Ayurveda); and Jivaka (the great physician to Gautama Buddha and his followers).” https://www.taksha.org/about/history/

-- The region around Taxila was settled by the neolithic era, with some ruins at Taxila dating to 3360 BCE. This date links the settlement to Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization. Ruins dating from the Early Harappan period around 2900 BCE have also been discovered in the Taxila area. (Allchin, Bridget; Allchin, Raymond (1988). The rise of civilization in India and Pakistan. Cambridge [u.a.]: Cambridge University Press, p.127). The first major settlement at Taxila, in Hathial mound, was established around 1000 BCE. By 900 BCE, the city was already involved in regional commerce, as discovered pottery shards reveal trading ties between the city and Puṣkalāvatī.(Allchin, Bridget; Allchin, Raymond, 1988, opcit., p.314). The origins of the ancient Takṣaśilā as a center of learning, date back to 900 BCE (per the latest archaeology excavations), the same era when the Olympic Games originated in Greece, then called Hellas, (per E.Pococke, "India in Greece”, 1851, named after the ‘Hela' mountain range in Balochistan), its destruction by caucasian Huns ca.530 CE, a century after the Olympic Games were stopped ca. 430 CE, by the Christian decree, declaring them to be “pagan" festivals. Later on, Taxila was inhabited at Bhir Mound, dated to sometime around the period 800-525 BCE with these early layers bearing "grooved" Red Burnished Ware. (Petrie, Cameron, (2013). "Taxila", in D. K. Chakrabarti and M. Lal (eds.), History of Ancient India III: The Texts, and Political History and Administration till c. 200 BC, Vivekananda International Foundation, Aryan Books International, Delhi, p. 656.)
--Indus Script hieroglyphs on Takshashila Menander I coins and Bharhut, Sanchi Yavana sculptural reliefs are emphatic archaeologically attested links to Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.
--Taxila was founded in a strategic location along the ancient "Royal Highway" that connected the Mauryan capital at Pataliputra in Bihar, with ancient Peshawar, Puṣkalāvatī, and onwards towards Central Asia via Kashmir, Bactria, and Kāpiśa.
-- Takṣaśilā was a principal Trade center, in the intersection of three major trade routes, of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization and one suggestion is that the city was the major trading center of the civilization ca. 900 BCE, given its location intersecting three major trade routes.
-- Alexander the Great was able to gain control of Taxila (Ancient Greek: Τάξιλα in 326 BCE without a battle, as the city was surrendered by its ruler, king Omphis (Āmbhi). Greek historians accompanying Alexander described Taxila as "wealthy, prosperous, and well governed". Arrian writes that Alexander was welcomed by the citizens of the city, and he offered sacrifices and celebrated a gymnastic and equestrian contest there. (Arrian, Anabasis of Alexander, § 5.8)
-- By 317 BCE, the Greek satraps left by Alexander were driven out, and Taxila came under the control of Chandragupta Maurya, who turned Taxila into a regional capital. His advisor, Kautilya/Chanakya, was said to have taught at Taxila's university. Under the reign of Ashoka, Chandragupta's grandson, the city was made a great seat of Buddhist learning
--In the 2nd century BCE, Taxila was annexed by the Indo-Greek kingdom of Bactria. IndoGreeks built a new capital, Sirkap, on the opposite bank of the river from Taxila. During this new period of Bactrian Greek rule, several dynasties (like Antialcidas) likely ruled from the city as their capital. During lulls in Greek rule, the city managed profitably on its own, to independently control several local trade guilds, who also minted most of the city's autonomous coinage. In about the 1st century BCE or 1st century CE, an Indo-Scythian king named Azilises had three mints, one of which was at Taxila, and struck coins with obverse

legends in Greek and Kharoṣṭhī.The last Greek king of Taxila was overthrown by the IndoScythian chief Maues around 90 BCE. Gondophares, founder of the Indo-Parthian Kingdom, conquered Taxila around 20 BCE, and made Taxila his capital. (Marshall, John, H., 1951, Taxila: Structural remains – Volume 1, p.85)
-- “Around the year 50 CE, the Greek Neopythagorean philosopher Apollonius of Tyana allegedly visited Taxila, which was described by his biographer, Philostratus, writing some 200 years later, as a fortified city laid out on a symmetrical plan, similar in size to Nineveh. Modern archaeology confirms this description.[50] Inscriptions dating to 76 CE demonstrate that the city had come under Kushan rule by that time, after the city was captured from the Parthians by Kujula Kadphises, founder of the Kushan Empire.[51] The great Kushan ruler Kanishka later founded Sirsukh, the most recent of the ancient settlements at Taxila.” (John Marshall, A Guide to Taxila, 4th edition, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960, pp. 28-30, 69, and 88-89.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxila
--In the mid fourth century CE, the Gupta Empire occupied the territories in Eastern Gandhara, establishing a Kumaratya's post at Taxila. The City became well known for its Trade linksincluding Silk, Sandalwood, Horses, Cotton, Silverware, Pearls, and Spices. It is during this time that the City heavily features in Classical Indian Literature- both as a centre of Culture as well as a militarised border City.Taxila's university remained in existence during the travels of Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who visited Taxila around 400 CE. He wrote that Taxila's name translated as "the Severed Head", and was the site of a story in the life of Buddha "where he gave his head to a man" (A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms, Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fa-Hsien of his Travels in India and Ceylon in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline, Chapter 11.)
--Taxila became a noted centre of learning (including the religious teachings of Buddhism) at least several centuries BCE, and continued to attract students from around the old world until the destruction of the city in the 5th century. It has been suggested that at its height, Taxila exerted a sort of "intellectual suzerainty" over other centres of learning in India and its primary concern was not with elementary, but higher education. Generally, a student entered Taxila at the age of sixteen. The ancient and the most revered scriptures, and the Eighteen Silpas or Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science. Students came to Taxila from far-off places such as Kashi, Kosala and Magadha, in spite of the long and arduous journey they had to undergo, on account of the excellence of the learned teachers there, all recognised as authorities on their respective subjects.( Prakash,1964, opcit.): "Students from Magadha traversed the vast distances of northern India in order to join the schools and colleges of Taxila. We learn from Pali texts that Brahmana youths, Khattiya princes and sons of setthis from Rajagriha, Kashi, Kosala and other places went to Taxila for learning the Vedas and eighteen sciences and arts.")
--Taxila was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980 in particular for the ruins of the four settlement sites at Bhir, Saraikala, Sirkap, and Sirsukh. which "reveal the pattern of urban evolution on the Indian subcontinent through more than five centuries". Total number of sites are 18:
1. Khanpur Cave 2. Saraikala, prehistoric mound 3. Bhir Mound 4. Sirkap (fortified city) 5. Sirsukh (fortified ruined city) 6. Dharmarajika stupa and monastery 7. Khader Mohra (Akhuri) 8. Kalawan group of buildings 9. Giri complex of monuments 10.Kunala stupa and monastery

-- A revised narrative on Poros the Great by Buddha Prakash (https://nalandainternational.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/poros.pdf ), employs and combines many Greek and other sources and questions the conclusions of Greek historians that Alexander the Great defeated Poros in the war in India. Buddha Prakash concludes that neither of them came out victorious after the battle. Among his many arguments is the claim that Poros, the King, was probably not wounded during the battle. But his son, also named Poros, was wounded. And by accounts of all historians, Alexander after the war gave more territory to Poros to rule than what Poros had before the war. Based upon Alexander’s ruthlessness, he questions Greek historians’ claims of Alexander’s supposed generosity and magnanimity.
-- Kiran Shahid Siddiqui in her monograph renders a lucid account of the Takṣaśilā University, states that Alexander made friends with King Ambhi, who managed Takṣaśilā U. She, however, fails to mention that it was Aristotle who had asked his pupil, Alexander, to bring back a famous yogi teacher for him to meet. https://www.academia.edu/31682098/University_of_Takshashila
-- The revised rendering of Poros the Great by Buddha Prakash, poses the question if Poros gifted an ukku (wootz) sword to Alexander after the latter announced his retreat from the campaign. The painting in Steel Authority of India, Ranchi provides a vivid account of this historic moment. In the background of the painting are the armourers at work in a smithy to produce the famed steel swords.
See: Steel pŏ lād sword gifted to Alexander by Porus is Russian word 'bulat' = steel traceable to Indus Script Meluhha word pōlaḍu, 'black drango' (Telugu) rebus pōlaḍu, pŏ lād प्वलाद् or

Damascus steels: history, processing, properties, and carbon dating -- J. Wadsworth & Indus Script inscriptions https://tinyurl.com/y7u2m76y
The best steel sword-blades are believed to have been forged in Persia from Indian wootz, which was also used to make shields and armor. These steels were known in the middle ages in Russia where they were called “bulat” steels. In Persia, they were known as “pouhad Janherder”.
Figure illustrates a drawing of King Puru of India greeting Alexander the Great (about 330 BC).
The centre-piece of the Ranchi Steel Authority of India Institute painting, in my view, is the smithy, forge shown to the left of the Alexander-Puru narrative of gift of a sword.
This painting is in the guest house of the largest R&D steel laboratory in the world, the Steel Authority of Irui@ itsRanchi (with a staff of 1200 research scientists and support personnel). After King Puru was defeated by Alexander the Great in battle, (as shown in the painting), the King gave, as a token of respect, his sword to Alexander, and behind the King, his aide is carrying an additional gift, a gold container within which is a cake of IndLsnwootz. At the time, this steel was more prized than gold!! In a more recent period, the Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin immortalized “bulat” with a similar comparison, when he wrote, in 1830, the following poem [A.C. Pushkin, Vol 1, Udozestvennia Literaturea, Moscow, (1978), p. 229.]:
All is mine, said gold All is mine, said bulat All I can buy, said gold All I will take, said bulat

-- Alexander took with him one of the the best yogis, Kalyan, whose name was changed to Kalanos. Unfortunately, Alexander decided not go back home but to stay-on in Babylon. The elderly Kalyan, sensing his imminent death, asked the soldiers to arrange for him a funeral pyre, as he did not want to be buried after his death. The soldiers grudgingly did so. Before entering the cremation fire, Kalanos is supposed to have stated “Alexander, I shall see you in a year”. Within a year later, Alexander died.
[quote]J.W. McCrindle in the Biographical Appendix to his ‘Ancient India as described by Arrian, Q. Curtius, Diodoros, Plutarch and Justin’ relates in connection with one Kalanos, an Indian Yogi, very interesting spiritual things. It throws light on the soul of India acting and influencing the lives of ancient Indians. He takes notice of all the available ancient Greek sources about Indian Yogis called by Greeks “gymnosophists’ and particularly about one called ‘Kalanos’ and writes about them thus:“Kalanos was a gymnosophist of Taxila (a region of ancient India), who left India with Alexander, and burned himself alive on a funeral pile at Sousa. His real name, Plutarch says, was Sphines; but the Greeks called him Kalanos, because, in saluting those who met, he used the word kale! Equivalent to hail! The Sanskrit adjective ‘kalyana’ means salutary, lucky, well, etc. If we except Sandrokottos, Taxiles and Poros, there is no other Indian with whose history, opinions and personal characteristics the classical writers have made us so well acquainted as with those of Kalanos. ... I shall here present translations of all the passages I can find which relate to him, and to another gymnosophist who was a man of a very different stamp called Mandanes, and sometimes, but improperly, Dandamis”[unquote].
https://indianpeoplescongress.wordpress.com/alexander-the-great-and-kalanus-the-yogi/
“Kalyana accompanied Alexander the Great to Persis and later self-immolated himself by entering into a Holy Pyre, in front of Alexander and his army. Diodorus Siculus called him Caranus (Ancient Greek: Κάρανος). He did not flinch while his body was burning. He bode goodbye to the soldiers but not to Alexander. He communicated to Alexander that he would meet him in Babylon. Alexander died exactly a year later in Babylon.

The first university of the world as a center for ādhyāmikā enquiries & knowledge related to disciplines such as medicine (founded on yoga) and a rainbow of other disciplines, was instituted in तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā prior to ca. 600 BCE. Located on three cross-roads of
Ancient Maritime Trade, तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā has been the center of warehousing of goods arriving from all over Ancient Far East (India, continental routes of Southern Bharat and the Brahmaputra, Ganga, Mekong, Irrawaddy-Salween Himalayan River Basins, the Indian Ocean Rim), for onward transport via Khyber Pass and other means to other countries outside of (Greater) India in Ancient Near East. This trade center role of तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā was further reinforced by the economic activities of Madra region with the capital of साकला (Sialkot) situated across the River Tavi from Jammu, on the उत्तरापथ , uttarāpatha called the Royal Road by Herodotus.

साकला is Sialkot. साकला (Ancient Greek Σάγγαλα) is mentioned in the Mahabharata. It was the capital of Madra kingdom.
"The first city of Taxila at Hathial goes back at least to c. 1000 B.C.E."( Raymond Allchin, Bridget Allchin, The Rise of Civilization in India. Cambridge University Press, 1982 p.314.) Some monuments at Taxila date to Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE, followed successively by Mauryan Empire, Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and Kushan Empire periods. "Kautilya was also a Professor of Politics and Economics at Taxila University. Taxila University is one of the oldest known universities in the world and it was the chief learning centre in ancient India."(Balakrishnan Muniapan, Junaid M. Shaikh (2007), "Lessons in corporate governance from Kautilya's Arthashastra in ancient
India", World Review of Entrepreneurship, Management and Sustainable Development 3 (1).) "Thus the various centres of learning in different parts of the country became affiliated, as it were, to the educational centre, or the central university, of Taxila which exercised a kind of intellectual suzerainty over the wide world of letters in India... "This shows that Taxila was a seat not of elementary, but higher, education, of colleges or a university as distinguished from schools."(Radha Kumud Mookerji (2nd ed. 1951; reprint 1989), ''Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist , p. 478, 479, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass Publ.)

View of the Dharmarajika, an ancient stupa
Taxila was known in Pali as Takkasilā, and in Sanskrit as तक्षशिला (Takshashila,Takṣaśilā; "City of Cut Stone"), Urdu: تکششیلا meaning "City of Cut Stone" or "Takṣa Rock") . The Greeks pared the city's name down to Taxila. Also translated as "Rock of Taksha” in references from Rāmāyana describes it as a magnificent city famed for its wealth which was founded by Bharata, the younger brother of Rama. Bharata, who also founded nearby Pushkalāvati, installed his two sons, Taksha and Pushkala, as the rulers of the two
cities. (Marshall, John H. (1960). A Guide to Taxila (4th ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p.10). Another interpretation is that Takṣaśilā is related to Takshaka (Sanskrit for "carpenter") and is an alternate name for the Nāga, a non-Indo-Iranian people of ancient India. (Kosambi, Damodar Dharmanand (1975) [first published 1956]. An Introduction to the
Study of Indian History (Revised Second ed.). Bombay: Popular Prakashan. p. 129.) Faxian who had visited the city had given its name's meaning as "Cut off Head". With the help of a Jataka, he had interperted it to be the place where Buddha in his previous birth as Pusa or Chandaprabha cut off his head to feed a hungry lion. This tradition still persists with the area in front of Sirkap (also meaning "cut off head") was known in the 19th century as Babur Khana ("House of Tiger"), which alludes to the place where Buddha offered his head. In addition, a hill range to south of Taxila Valley is called Margala ("cut off throat")... In Vedic texts such as
the ितपथब्राह्म ण, it is mentioned that the Vedic philosopher Uddālaka āruni (c. 7th century BCE) had travelled to the region of Gandhara. In later Buddhist texts, the Jatakas, it is specified
that Taxila was the city where Aruni and his son Śvetaketu each had received their education. In the Buddhist Jatakas, Taxila is described as the capital of the kingdom of Gandhara and a great centre of learning with world-famous teachers. The Takkasila Jataka, more commonly known as the Telapatta Jataka, tells the tale of a prince of Benares who is told that he would become the king of Takkasila if he could reach the city within seven days without falling prey to the yakkhinis who waylaid travellers in the forest. According to the Dipavamsa, one of Taxila's early kings was a Kshatriya named Dipankara who was succeeded by twelve sons and grandsons. Kuñjakarṇa, mentioned in the Avadanakalpalata, is another king associated with the city. (Marshall, John H., ibid., Raychaudhuri, Hem Chandra (1923), Political history of ancient
India, from the accession of Parikshit to the extinction of the Gupta dynasty, pp. 17–18, 25–26; Saifur

Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī, a Samskrtam grammar treatise dated to the 5th century BCE mentions the city. King Janamejaya’s sarpa (snake) yajna was performed at Takṣaśilā and is traditionally narrated by Vaiśampāyana at the behest of Vyāsa. The Kuru Kingdom's heir, Parikshit (grandson of Arjuna) is said to have been enthroned at Takṣaśilā. (Kosambi, DD, opcit., p.126). When the Achaemenid conquests of the sapta-sindhu region occurred around 515 BCE, the armies realised that this was a renowned center of knowledge systems. This significance of तक्षशिला , Takṣaśilā as a center of learning, the earliest University of the World happened because of its location at the crossroads of active trade routes of Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization.When Alexander’s armies came to the region ca.4th cent.BCE, Takṣaśilā
University was led by a panel of masters which included Pāṇini पाणिणि variously dated between ca. 4th century BCE and 6th to 5th century BCE.

The word wootz (Michael Faraday, as quoted by Peter Day, The Philosopher's Tree, p. 108) may have been a mistranscription of wook, an anglicised version of urukku (உருக்கு)
(ഉരുക്ക ), the word for melting in Tamil and Malayalam or urukke, the word for steel
in Kannada (ಉು ರ್‍స్ , ಉು ಕ್ಕ ),Telugu (ఉక్కు ) and many other Dravidian languages." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootz_steel
What could be the source of the word bulat (Russian)? If the sword was forged from wootz (ukku -- Kannada, Telugu), is it possible that the word bulat was adapted from pola 'magnetite' iron in Asuri (Meluhha) language? Wootz may be derived from utsa 'spring of water' attesting to the watery pattern formed on the wootz (ukku, utsa) steel blade after forging of the crucible steel cake.



17
Wootz was imported into the Middle East from India. (Jeffrey Wadsworth and Oleg D. Sherby (1980). "On the Bulat – Damascus Steel Revisited". Prog. Mater. Sci. 25 (1): 35–68)
"The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word پولاد (transliterated
pulad), meaning steel.
Bulat steel blade of a knife."Bulat is a type of steel alloy known in Russia from medieval times; regularly being mentioned in Russian legends as the material of choice for cold steel. The name булат is a Russian transliteration of the Persian word fulad, meaning steel. This type of steel was used by the armies of nomadic peoples. Bulat steel was the main type of steel used for swords in the armies of Genghis Khan, the great emperor of the Mongolian Empire. The technique used in making wootz steel has been lost for centuries and the bulat steel used today makes use of a more recently developed technique...Carbon steel consists of two components: pure iron, in the form of ferrite, and cementite or iron



18
carbide, a compound of iron and carbon. Cementite is very hard and brittle; its hardness is about 640 by the Brinell hardness test, whereas ferrite is only 200. The amount of the carbon and the cooling regimen determine the crystalline and chemical composition of the final steel. In bulat, the slow cooling process allowed the cementite to precipitate as micro particles in between ferrite crystals and arrange in random patterns. The color of the carbide is dark while steel is grey. This mixture is what leads to the famous patterning of Damascus steel.
Polad, bulat crucible steel
'Schrader gives a list of names for 'steel' related to Pers. pulAd; Syr. pld; Kurd. pila, pola, pulad; Pehl. polAwat; Armen. polovat; Turk. pala; Russ. bulat; Mizdzhegan polad, bolat; Mongol. bolot, bulat, buriat. He is unable to suggest an origin for these words. Fr. Muller pointed out that the Pehlevi and Armenian should be polapat and suggested Greek 'muchbeaten' as the original word...not all the countries of Asia had been exhausted in search for similar names...by adding Tibetan p'olad, Sulu bAlan, Tagalog patalim, Ilocano paslip, we at once see that the origin of the word may lie to the east. Naturally one thinks of China as the possible point of issue, for there steel was known in the third millenium before our era and we have the positive reference to steel in a Chinese writer of the fifth century BCE...Cantonese dialect fo-lim, literally 'fire-sickle'..."(Wiener, Leo, 2002, Contributions toward a history of Arabico-Gothc culture, vol.4, Gorgias Press LLC, pp. xli-xlii)
"...‘pulad’ of Central Asia. The oasis of Merv where crucible steel was also made by the medieval period lies in this region. The term ‘pulad’ appears in Avesta, the holy book of Zorastrianism and in a Manichéen text of Chinese Turkestan. There are many variations of this term ranging from the Persian ‘polad’, the Mongolian ‘bolat’ and ‘tchechene’, the Russian ‘bulat’, the Ukrainian and Armenian ‘potovat’, Turkish and Arab ‘fulad’, ‘farlad’ in Urdu and ‘phaulad’ in Hindi. It is this bewildering variety of descriptions that was used in the past that makes a study of this subject so challenging." https://www.scribd.com/doc/268526061/Wootz-Steel-Indian-Institute-of-Science Wootz Steel, Indian Institute of Science

Harappa h1018a copper plate with young bull + a four-pointed starfish (Gangetic octopus?)
: Mohenjo-daro seal m297a with young bull + a five-pointed star-fish (Gangetic octopus?) + hypertext of inscription. + Seal impression
Decipherment of Text Message on m297 Seal
The text message on the Mohenjo-daro seal m297 is:
The rebus readings are: Line 1: bhaṭa kolimi kuṭi taksha khaṇḍa 'furnace, smithy, forge, smelter equipment'
Line 2: beṛɔ 'palace'. beṛhī 'smithy guild in a citadel (enclosure), with a warehouse
(granary)' aya kammaṭa kaṇḍ karṇa karṇaka 'storehouse, alloymetal mint, scribe, helmsman'
This text message is read together with the field symbol on m297 Seal. The field symbol is that of a merchant in charge of the storehouse (treasury) who is kunda singi bəḍhàri ornament-gold-fine gold-smithy treasurer-merchant (kunda 'fine gold'; singi 'ornament gold')
Thus, the inscription of both the text message and the field symbol signify: .
kunda singi bəḍhàri ornament-gold-fine-gold-smithy treasurer-merchant (managing as Supercargo)
bhaṭa kolimi kuṭi khaṇḍa 'furnace, smithy, forge, smelter equipment'



21
(from)
beṛɔ 'palace'. beṛhī 'smithy guild in a citadel (enclosure), with a warehouse (granary)' aya kammaṭa kaṇḍ karṇa karṇaka 'storehouse, alloymetal mint'
The last two signs constitute a hypertext to signify that (cargo products are authenticated by scribe and cargo controlled by helmsman)
Decipherment of field symbol on h1018 copper plate and m297 seal
The field symbol is a combination of animal parts: साांगड [ sāṅgaḍa ] m f (सांघट्ट S) f A body formed of two or more (fruits, animals, men) linked or joined together. Rebus: jangaḍ ‘good entrusted on approval basis’; jangaḍiyo ‘military guard who accompanies treasure into the treasury’
The rebus reading of the ligatured octopus is: hieroglyph: veṛhā 'octopus' Rebus: beṛɔ 'palace'. beṛhī 'smithy guild in a citadel (enclosure), with a warehouse (granary)'; jangaḍiyo bəḍhàri ʻmilitary guard in charge of treasure and stores of a templeʼ;.
I submit that the ligatured unicorn + octopus signifies: Hieroglyph: veṛhā octopus, said to be found in the Indus Rebus: bəḍhàri ʻman in charge of treasure and stores of a templeʼ; vēḷāṉ 'merchant' PLUS a spiny-horned young bull with the horn projecting forward which is read in Meluhha as: singhin kōḍe 'spiny-horned young bull' rebus:1.singi koḍ 'ornament gold artisan's workshop'; 2. singi कोांद kōnda 'ornament gold kiln, furnace'.
Thus, the reading of the field symbol on h1018 and m297 is: Alternative 1: vēḷāṉ singi koḍ 'merchant, ornament gold artisan's workshop'; Alternative 2: vēḷāṉ singi कोांद kōnda 'merchant, ornament gold kiln, furnace'; Alternative 3: kunda singi bəḍhàri gold-smithy treasurer-merchant; Alternative 4: kunda singi vēḷāṉ .'gold-smithy treasurer-merchant'. I suggest these alternatives because it is tough to precisely determine if the 'merchant' semantics is conveyed by the word bəḍhàri (WPah.) or vēḷāṉ (Tamil) -- when the Indus Script inscription was written, ca. 2500 BCE.
I submit that the most likely reading of the field symbol on m1018 (seal) and h297 (copper plate) is Alternative 3: kunda singi bəḍhàri gold-smithy treasurer-merchant; (kunda 'fine gold'; singi 'ornament gold').
Explanation for bəḍhàri > vēḷāṉ sequence of phonetic transform
My submission is that the word vēḷāṉ 'merchant' is a later-date phonetic variant of the WPah cognate bəḍhàri 'merchant', because 1) the WPah etymon also conveys the semantics of storehouse or treasury-in-charge which may be an evolution of the functions of the merchant of the guild of artisans and traders at a date later than ca. 2500 BCE; and 2) the ve- syllable in veṛhā 'octopus' (Jatki) and the ve-syllable in vēḷāṉ 'merchant' (Tamil) signify that the syllable is derived from the syllable be- in bəḍhàri (WPah.); thus, indicating be- > vechronological sequencing of phonetic transformations in the parole or speech forms of

Meluhha.
The b- > v- transform is most vividly seen in the following expressions, related to the boar metaphors which are dominant in Ancient Indiant tradition; it is thus logical to assume that bəḍhàri 'merchant' chronologically predates the synonym vēḷāṉ 'merchant' in variant pronunciation: The
The b- > v- transform is validated by the following semantic sequencing from WPah to Tamil:

Campaigns and landmarks of Alexander's march into northwest Indian subcontinent. Alexander’s advances were stopped by Porus (of the Puru people) on the River Jhelum. Macedonian forces conquers much of the Sapta-Sindhu region, yet has to stop the advance into the Ganga Plain.
“Greek accounts mention the existence of cities and fortified towns such as Taxila. Arrian mentions that after defeating Porus, Alexander marched eastwards towards the Chenab River, and captured 37 towns: the smallest of these towns had 5,000 or more inhabitants In the Swat valley, Alexander is said to have seized 230,000 oxen (possibly Zebu), intending to send them to Macedonia for ploughing land. Aristobulus saw rice being grown in paddy fields, Onesicritus reported the existence of a crop called bosmoran (possibly the pearl millet), and Nearchus wrote of "honey-yielding reeds" (presumably the sugarcane) Nearchus also mentions that Indians wore clothes made of cotton. Rock salt was extracted from the Salt Range, and supplied to other parts of India.[15] Some primitive communities existed in the forest, desert, and coastal regions of the subcontinent. For example, Nearchus mentions that people around the Tomeros river (Hingol) subsisted on fishing, and used stone tools instead of iron ones.The Greek writers mention the priestly class of Brahmanas (as "Brachmanes"), who are described as teachers of Indian philosophy.[16] They do not refer to the existence of any religious temples or idols in India, although such references commonly occur in their descriptions of Alexander's campaigns in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Iran. Greek accounts mention naked ascetics called gymnosophists. A philosopher named Calanus (probably a Greek transcription of the Indian name "Kalyana") accompanied Alexander to Persepolis, where he committed suicide on a public funeral pyre: he was probably a Jain or an Ajivika monk. Curiously, there is no reference to Bauddham in the Greek accounts.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_campaign_of_Alexander_the_Great

On his return, in 325 BCE, Alexander took with him many scholars from this center to Greece. The scholars were learned in a number of disciplines which included: Vedas, Language, Grammar, Philosophy, Medicine, Surgery, Archery, Politics, Warfare, Astronomy, Astrology, Accounts, Commerce, Futurology, Documentation, Occult, Music, Dance.
Battle of the Hydaspes (Beas) River
Ptolemy coin with Alexander wearing an elephant scalp, symbol of his campaign in the Sapta-Sindhu region.
The Battle of the Hydaspes River was fought by Alexander in July 326 BC against king Porus (possibly, Paurava) on the Hydaspes River (Jhelum River) in the Punjab, near Bhera. The Hydaspes was the last major battle fought by Alexander...
Porus was a regional King in India. Arrian writes about Porus, in his own words:
One of the Indian Kings called Porus, a man remarkable alike for his personal strength and noble courage, on hearing the report about Alexander, began to prepare for the inevitable. Accordingly, when hostilities broke out, he ordered his army to attack Macedonians from whom he demanded their king, as if he was his private enemy. Alexander lost no time in joining battle, but his horse being wounded in the first charge, he fell headlong to the ground, and was saved by his attendants who hastened up to his assistance.
Porus drew up on the south bank of the Jhelum River, and was set to repel any crossings. The Jhelum River was deep and fast enough that any opposed crossing would probably doom the entire attacking force. Alexander knew that a direct crossing would fail, so he found a suitable crossing, about 27 km (17 mi) upstream of his camp. The name of the place is "Kadee". Alexander left his general Craterus behind with most of the army while he crossed the river upstream with a strong contingent. Porus sent a small cavalry and chariot force under his son to the crossing.
According to sources, Alexander had already encountered Porus's son, so the two men were not strangers. Porus's son killed Alexander's horse with one blow, and Alexander fell to the ground. Also writing about this encounter, Arrian adds,
Other writers state that there was a fight at the actual landing between Alexander's cavalry and a force of Indians commanded by Porus's son, who was there ready to oppose them with superior numbers, and that in the course of fighting he (Porus's son) wounded Alexander with his own hand and struck the blow which killed his (Alexander's) beloved horse Buccaphalus.

The force was easily routed, and according to Arrian, Porus' son was killed. Porus now saw that the crossing force was larger than he had expected, and decided to face it with the bulk of his army. Porus's army were poised with cavalry on both flanks, the war elephants in front, and infantry behind the elephants. These war elephants presented an especially difficult situation for Alexander, as they scared the Macedonian horses.
Alexander started the battle by sending horse archers to shower the Porus's left cavalry wing, and then used his cavalry to destroy Porus's cavalry. Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanxes had crossed the river to engage the charge of the war elephants. The Macedonians eventually surrounded Porus's force.
Diodorus wrote about the battle tactics of war elephants:
Upon this the elephants, applying to good use their prodigious size and strength, killed some of the enemy by trampling under their feet, and crushing their armour and their bones, while upon other they inflicted a terrible death, for they first lifted them aloft with their trunks, which they twisted round their bodies and then dashed them down with great violence to the ground. Many others they deprived in a moment of life by goring them through and through with their tusks.
The fighting style of Porus' soldiers was described in detail by Arrian:
The foot soldiers carry a bow made of equal length with the man who bears it. This they rest upon the ground, and pressing against it with their left foot thus discharges the arrow, having drawn the string far backwards for the shaft they use is little short for three yards long, and



27
there is nothing can resist an Indian archer's shot, neither shield nor breast plate, nor any stronger defence if such there be.
According to Curtius Quintus, Alexander towards the end of the day sent a few ambassadors to Porus:
Alexander, anxious to save the life of this great and gallant soldier, sent Texile the Indian to him (to Porus). Texile rode up as near as he dared and requested him to stop his elephant and hear what message Alexander sent him, escape was no longer possible. But Texiles was an old enemy of the Indian King, and Porus turned his elephant and drove at him, to kill him with his lance; and he might indeed have killed him, if he had not spurred his horse out of the way in the nick of the time. Alexander, however, far from resenting this treatment of his messenger, sent a number of others, last of whom was Indian named Meroes, a man he had been told had long been Porus' friend.
According to Plutarch this was one of Alexander's hardest battles:
The combat then was of a more mixed kind; but maintained with such obstinacy, that it was not decided till the eighth hour of the day.
Plutarch also wrote that the bitter fighting of the Hydaspes made Alexander's men hesitant to continue on with the conquest of India, considering that they would potentially face far larger armies than those of Porus if they were to cross the Ganga River.
Porus was one of many local kings who impressed Alexander. Wounded in his shoulder, standing over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall, but still on his feet, he was asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated. "Treat me, Alexander, the way a King treats another King", Porus responded. Other historians question the accuracy of this entire event, noting that Porus would never have said those words. Philostratus the Elder in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana writes that in the army of Porus there was an elephant who had fought bravely against Alexander's army and Alexander dedicated it to Helios (Sun) and named it Ajax, because he thought that a so great animal deserved a great name. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek: "Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to Helios" (ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ Ο ΔΙΟΣ ΤΟΝ ΑΙΑΝΤΑ ΤΩΙ ΗΛΙΩΙ).
Alexander did not continue, thus leaving all the headwaters of the Indus River unconquered. He later founded Alexandria Nikaia (Victory), located at the battle site, to commemorate his triumph. He also founded Alexandria Bucephalus on the opposite bank of the river in memory of his much-cherished horse, Bucephalus, who carried Alexander through the Indian subcontinent and died heroically during the Battle of Hydaspes.
Musicanus (Ancient Greek: Μουσικανὸς, Indian: Mûshika[) was an Indian king at the head of the Indus, who raised a rebellion against Alexander the Great around 323 BCE. Peithon, one of Alexander's generals, managed to put down the revolt:
"Meantime he was informed that Musicanus had revolted. He dispatched the viceroy, Peithon, son of Agenor, with a sufficient army against him, while he himself marched against the cities which had been put under the rule of Musicanus. Some of these he razed to the ground, reducing the inhabitants to slavery; and into others he introduced garrisons and fortified the citadels. After accomplishing this, he returned to the camp and fleet. By this time Musicanus had been captured by Peithon, who was bringing him to Alexander." - Arrian Anabasis



28
The King of Patala came to Alexander and surrendered. Alexander let him keep possession of his own dominions, with instructions to provide whatever was needed for the reception of the army.
Revolt of the army
East of Porus's kingdom, near the Ganga River (the Hellenic version of the Indian name Ganga), was the powerful Nanda Empire of Magadha and the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal. Fearing the prospects of facing other powerful Indian armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (the modern Beas River), refusing to march further east.
Alexander's troops beg to return home from India in plate 3 of 11 by Antonio Tempesta of
Florence, 1608.
As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges (Ganga) also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand fighting elephants.
— Plutarch's Lives]
Chandraketugarh in West Bengal, India is believed to
be the capital of Gangaridai. The Gangaridai army, with its 4,000-elephant force, may have
led to Alexander's retreat from India.
Gangaridai, a nation which possesses a vast force of the largest-sized elephants. Owing to this, their country has never been conquered by any foreign king: for all other nations dread the overwhelming number and strength of these animals. Thus Alexander the Macedonian,



29
after conquering all Asia, did not make war upon the Gangaridai, as he did on all others; for when he had arrived with all his troops at the river Ganges, he abandoned as hopeless an invasion of the Gangaridai when he learned that they possessed four thousand elephants well trained and equipped for war.
— Megasthenes, Indika
Alexander, using the incorrect maps of the Greeks, thought that the world ended a mere 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) away, at the edge of India. He therefore spoke to his army and tried to persuade them to march further into India, but Coenus pleaded with him to change his mind and return, saying the men "longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland". Alexander, seeing the unwillingness of his men, agreed and turned back.

Karatoya Mahatmya refers to the sacredness of this river. Rivers Kosi and Mahananda joined the Karatoya and "formed a sort of ethnic boundary between people living south of it and the Kochs and Kiratas living north of the river." (Majumdar, Dr. R.C., History of Ancient Bengal, First published 1971, Reprint 2005, p. 4, Tulshi Prakashani, Kolkata.)
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa provides a detailed account of the movement of people (Videgha Māthava, Gotama Rahugaṇa) from River Sarasvati to River Sadānīra. The location of this river is central to the history of Pre-Mauryan era Bhāratam Janam (RV 3.53.12). The region of these people has been identified in this monograph and relates to the ironwork of the Bronze Age Sarasvati Civilization. It is possible that both Brahmautra and Ganga river systems were waterways which provided for maritime transport of tin ore from the Himalayan riverbasins (Irrawaddy, Salween, Mekong) which contain the richest and largest tin belt of the globe (as the rivers ground down graniterocks to create the cassiterite -- tin ore -- deposit accumulations as placer deposits). Sources of tin were critical to unleash the TinBronze Industrial Revolution of ca. 4th millennium BCE.

"Mâthava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvatî.



31
He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama Râhûgana and
the Videgha Mâthava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up)
all these rivers.
Now that (river), which is called ‘Sadânîrâ,’ flows from the northern (Himâlaya) mountain:
that one he did not burn over. That one the Brâhmans did not cross in former times, thinking,
‘it has not been burnt over by Agni Vaisvânara.’
Now-a-days, however, there are many Brâhmans to the east of it. At that time it (the land east of the Sadânîrâ) was very uncultivated, very marshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vaisvânara.
Now-a-days, however, it is very cultivated, for the Brâhmans have caused (Agni) to taste it through sacrifices. Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages along: so cold is it, not having been burnt over by Agni Vaisvânara.
Mâthava, the Videgha, then said (to Agni), ‘Where am I to abide?’ ‘To the east of this (river) be thy abode!’ said he. Even now this (river) forms the boundary of the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the Mâthavas (or descendants of Mâthava). (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4)
"Rennel made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches—Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatoya_River

During the reign of Menander I Soter (Ancient Greek: Μένανδρος Αʹ ὁ Σωτήρ, Ménandros Aʹ ho Sōtḗr, "Menander I the Saviour"; known in Indian Pali sources as Milinda) and after his conversion to Bauddham, साकला became the capital of his Indo-Greek Kingdom (165/155 130 BCE). Menander was initially a King of Bactria.
“May the venerable Nâgasena accept me as a supporter of the faith, as a true convert from today onwards as long as life shall last!... And afterwards, taking delight in the wisdom of the Elder, he handed over his kingdom to his son, and abandoning the household life for the houseless state, grew great in insight, and himself attained to Arahatship!” — The Questions of King Milinda, Translation by T. W. Rhys Davids, 1890
About Menander, Strabo notes: “The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Ariana, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander-- by Menander in particular (at least if he actually crossed the Hypanis towards the east and advanced as far as the Imaüs), for some were subdued by him personally and others by Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus the king of the Bactrians; and they took possession, not only of Patalena, but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of Saraostus and Sigerdis. In short, Apollodorus says that Bactriana is the ornament of Ariana as a whole; and, more than that, they extended their empire even as far as the Seres and the Phryni.”— Strabo, Geographica [loc.cit. (in Greek) Strabo
(1877). "11.11.1". In Meineke, A. (ed.). Geographica (in Greek). Leipzig: Teubner.Jones, H. L., ed. (1924). At the Perseus Project.)
Called Milinda, his kingdom extended from Kabul River valley in the west to the Ravi River in the east (modern day regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab in Pakistan and Punjab, Haryana and parts of Himachal Pradesh and the Jammu), and from the Swat River valley in the north to Arachosia the Helmand Province. He launched expeditions southward into Rajasthan and as far east down the Ganges River Valley as Pataliputra (Patna). “Greek geographer Strabo wrote that Menander ‘conquered more tribes than Alexander the Great.’
An important Pali text is titled: Milinda Panha ("The Questions of King Milinda"; panha meaning "question" in Pali). Milinda is introduced in this text as:



51
‘King of the city of Sâgala in India, Milinda by name, learned, eloquent, wise, and able; and a faithful observer, and that at the right time, of all the various acts of devotion and ceremony enjoined by his own sacred hymns concerning things past, present, and to come. Many were the arts and sciences he knew—holy tradition and secular law; the Sânkhya, Yoga, Nyâya, and Vaisheshika systems of philosophy; arithmetic; music; medicine; the four Vedas, the Purânas, and the Itihâsas; astronomy, magic, causation, and magic spells; the art of war; poetry; conveyancing in a word, the whole nineteen. As a disputant he was hard to equal, harder still to overcome; the acknowledged superior of all the founders of the various schools of thought. And as in wisdom so in strength of body, swiftness, and valour there was found none equal to Milinda in all India. He was rich too, mighty in wealth and prosperity, and the number of his armed hosts knew no end.’

Indian ship on lead coin of Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi, testimony to the naval, seafaring and trading capabilities of the Satavahanas during the 1st–2nd century CE."The Satavahanas participated in (and benefited from) economic expansion through intensification of agriculture, increased production of other commodities, and trade within and beyond the Indian subcontinent.
During the Satavahana period, several large settlements emerged in the fertile areas, especially along the major rivers. The amount of land under agricultural use also expanded significantly, as a result of forest clearance and construction of irrigation reservoirs.



55
The exploitation of sites with mineral resources may have increased during the Satavahana period, leading to the emergence of new settlements in these areas. Such sites facilitated commerce and crafts (such as ceramic ware). The increased craft production during the Satavahana period is evident from archaeological discoveries at sites such as Kotalingala, as well as epigraphic references to artisans and guilds.
The Satavahanas controlled the Indian sea coast, and as a result, they dominated the growing Indian trade with the Roman Empire. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea mentions two important Satavahana trade centres: Pratishthana and Tagara. Other important urban centres included Kondapur, Banavasi and Madhavpur. Nanaghat was the site of an important pass that linked the Satavahana capital Pratishthana to the sea." (Charles Higham 2009, Charles Higham (2009). Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations.

The Viṣṇu Purāṇa relates that when Vena who was wicked by nature and prohibited worship and sacrifice, was beaten to death by the pious sages, and when consequently robbery and anarchy prevailed in the absence of a King, the Munis rubbed the right arm of the dead king to produce a son, and from it sprang the majestic Pṛithu, glowing like Agni. He was immediately declared King, and his subjects who had suffered from famine, besought the monarch for the edible fruits and plants which the earth withheld from them. In anger Pṛithu took up his bow to compel her to yield the supply so much needed by his subjects. She assumed the form of a cow and began to flee chased by the King. But she at last yielded and requested him to spare her life, and at the same time promised to restore all the needed fruits, plants &c., 'if a calf were given to her through which she might be able to secrete milk.' Pṛithu thereupon made Svāyambhuva Manu the calf; milked the earth, and received the milk into his own hand, from which proceeded all kinds of corn, vegetables, fruits &c., for the maintenance of his subjects. The example or Pṛithu was afterwards followed by a variety of milkers-gods, men, Ṛiṣis, mountains, Nāgas, Asuras &c., who found out the proper milkman and calf from their own number, and milked the earth of whatever they wanted; cf. Ku.1.2.] (Apte)

of इला , Name of पुरूरवस् (cf. 1. ऐड्/अ)(हररवांि); pl. the descendants or family
of पुरूरवस् MBh. xiii
ययाशत (prob. fr. √ यत्) Name of a celebrated monarch of the lunar race (son of
king नहुष whom he succeeded ; from his two wives came the two lines of the lunar race
, यदु being the son of देवयानी , daughter of उिनस् or िुक्र , and पुरु of िशमणष्ठा , daughter
of वृष-पवणन् ; ययाशत नाहुष is also represented as the author of RV. ix , 101 , 4-6)(MonierWilliams)
It is clear from the three rca-s RV 9.101.4 to 6 that ययाशत, नाहुष , आयु are performers of Soma
yajna as descendants of इला also called पुरूरवस् .
पुरूरवस् is son of ुर्ध and इळा , father of आयुस् and ancestor of पुरु दुष्यन्त , भरत ,
कु रु , धृत-राष्ट र and पाु ण्ड , supposed to have instituted the 3 sacrificial fires [वाजसनेशय-सांशहता v,2]
Anu is also a performer of yajna and follower of Veda tradition: अनुत्वाशहेघ्न अध देव
देवा Rv.6.18.14. Thus, the battle of 10 kings, Daśarājñá yuddhá is among Aryan speakers who are also followers of Veda tradition.
सायणभाष्यम् identifies many of the combatants of Daśarājñá yuddhá.

The Bhrgus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid the two distant peoples
Wilson translation RV 7.18.6 Turvas'a, who was presiding (at solemn rites), diligent in sacrifice, (went to Suda_sa) for wealth; but like fishes restricted (to the element of water), the Bhrigus and Druhyus quickly assailed them; of these two everywhere going the friend (of Suda_sa, Indra) rescued his friend. [The legend: Indra saves one of the two, Suda_sa (and perhaps slays the other), turvas'am avadhi_t; matsyaso nis'itah, fishes limited to water; the people of the country Matsya were attacked by Turvas'a, tena matsyajanapada ba_dhitah; s'rus.t.im cakruh (applied to the Bhrigus) = as'upra_ptim cakruh; sukham turvas'asys cakruh-making the Bhrigus and Druhyus the allies of Turvas'a].

I agree with Sailendra Nath Sen that the name Sādavāhana derives from the Munda words Sadom ("horse") and Harpan ("son"), implying "son of the performer of a horse sacrifice".(Sailendra Nath Sen (1999). Ancient Indian History and Civilization. New Age International, pp. 172 to 176. )
The expression may also derive from sadom 'horse' and harap 'efficient, capable, accomplished':

Simuka (Brahmi:𑀲𑀺 𑀫𑀼 𑀓, Si-mu-ka) was an Indian king belonging to the Satavahana dynasty. He is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Nanaghat. (Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra , 2006, Political History Of Ancient India, p.336)
The Simuka inscription (photograph and rubbing) at the Naneghat Caves, in early Brahmi script:
𑀭𑀺𑀬𑀸 𑀲𑀺 𑀫𑀼 𑀓 𑀲𑀺𑀢𑀯𑀸𑀳𑀦𑁄 𑀲𑀺 𑀭𑀺 𑀫𑀼 𑀢𑁄
Rāyā Simuka - Sātavāhano sirimato
"King Simuka Satavahana, the illustrious one" [James Burgess; Georg Bühler (1883). Report on the Elura Cave Temples and the Brahmanical and Jaina Caves in Western India. Trübner & Company. p. 69.] " Simuka seems to be mentioned as the father of the acting king Satakarni in the Naneghat inscription dated to 70-60 BCE, itself considered on palaeographical grounds to be posterior to the Nasik Caves inscription of Kanha (probably Simuka's brother) in Cave 19, dated to 100-70 BCE. Recent analysis of sources puts Simuka ́s reign possibly around 120 - 96 BCE."(Ollett, Andrew, (2017). Language of the Snakes: Prakrit, Sanskrit, and the Language Order of Premodern India, University of
California Press, Okland, (Table 2, Appendix A), p. 189.) "According to the Puranic lists of



70
future kings, "137 years after the accession of Chandragupta Maurya, the Sungas will rule for 112 years and then the Kanvayanas for 45 years whose last king Susharman will be killed by the Andhra Simuka". If the accession of Chandragupta Maurya is dated to 324 BCE, then Simuka started to rule 294 years later, in 30 BCE."(Verma, Thakur Prasad (1971). The Palaeography Of Brahmi Script. pp. 87–88.) "The various Puranas have different names for the founder of the Andhra dynasty: Shishuka in Matsya Purana, Sipraka in Vishnu Purana, Sindhuka in Vayu Purana, Chhesmaka in Brahmanda Purana, and Shudraka or Suraka in Kumarika Khanda of Skanda Purana. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of Simuka, resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts."(Ajay Mitra Shastri
(1998). The Sātavāhanas and the Western Kshatrapas: a historical framework. Dattsons. p. 42.) Indica by Megasthenes (350 – 290 BCE) mentions a powerful tribe named "Andarae", whose king maintained an army of 100,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. If Andarae is identified with the Andhras, this can be considered additional evidence of Satavahana rule.
Andrew Ollett, in the analysis cited (2017), regards the possible period of Simuka's reign as 120 - 96 BCE.
The Naneghat inscription. Dated to 70-60 BCE, it mentions reigning king Satakarni I, his queen Naganika, and his probable father, the "illustrious"" Simuka. (Carla M. Sinopoli 2001, "On the edge of empire: form and substance in the Satavahana dynasty". In Susan E. Alcock (ed.). Empires: Perspectives from Archaeology and History.

Ravi river: "The river rises in the Bara Bhangal, District Kangra in Himachal Pradesh, India. The river drains a total catchment area of 14,442 square kilometres (5,576 sq mi) in India after flowing for a length of 720 kilometres (450 mi). Flowing westward, it is hemmed by the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges, forming a triangular zone." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_River

RV 7.18.8,9: Griffith translation:
8 Fools, in their folly fain to waste her waters, they parted inexhaustible Parusni. Lord of the Earth, he with his might repressed them: still lay the herd and the affrighted herdsman. 9 As to their goal they sped to their destruction: they sought Parusni; even the swift returnednot. Indra abandoned, to Sudas the manly, the swiftly flying foes, unmanly babblers.
Wilson translation RV 7.18.8,9
7.018.08 The evil-disposed and stupid (enemies of Suda_sa), crossing the humble Parus.n.i river, have broken down its banks; but he by his greatness pervades the earth, and Kavi, the son of Ca_yamana, like a falling victim, sleeps (in death). [Sleeps in death: killed Suda_sa]. 7.018.09 The waters followed their regular course to the Parus.n.i, nor (wandered) beyond it; the quick courser (of the king) came to the accessible places, and Indra made the idly-talking enemies, with their numerous progeny, subject among men (to Suda_sa). [Indra is said to have repaired the banks of the river so that the waters -- iyur artham na nyartham-- went to their object, that is, their former bed, not below or beyond it; the enemies Amitra_n are called vadhriva_cah or jalpaka_n].

Griffith translation RV 6.27.5 In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha.
At Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frightened.
A number of R̥ gveda people are mentioned and the ākhyāna narrative records the exploits of Indra at this river or city called Hariyūpiya where he smote the vanguard of the V ̥rcīvans. The exploits are also associated with cāyamāna and abhyāvartin as names of kings involved in the battles.
We do not know if this is a recollection of parts of or related to the Battle of the Ten Kings (dāśarājñá) alluded to in the R̥ gveda (Book 7, hymns 18, 33 and 83.4-8). The significant fact is that the battles occured on the banks of Ravi River in the Punjab.
The key link between the narratives of Daśarājñá yuddhá and Hariyūpiya is that Turvaśa is a participant in the battles at Hariyūpiya and the locus of both battle narratives is on the banks
of Ravi river. IN RV 6.27.7, Indra aids Turvaśa and सृञ्जय sṛñjaya m. N.: pl. N. of a family or
tribe. तुववश, Turvaśa were one of the five major people who lived southeast of the Sarasvati river region. Turvaśa and Yadu are often signified as one people, in the dual in Rgveda.
पृथु who are involved in both 1) the battle of तुववश, Turvaśa narrated in RV 6.27 and 2) also in the battles of Daśarājñá yuddhá.
The importance of Hariyūpiya as the locus of battles narrated in Rgveda may explain the later importance of the city of Harappa as a Bronze-Age trading centre with seafaring Meluhha merchants transporting metalwork and lapidary work products and cargo along navigable waterways.
Is it a coincidence that Harappa is located on the banks of Ravi River? "Harappa (Urdu/Punjabi: ہ
ّ
ہڑپ ) is an archaeological site in Punjab, Pakistan, about 24 km (15 mi) west of Sahiwal. The site takes its name from a modern village located near the former course of the Ravi River (Part of Panjnad, five rivers) which now runs 8 km (5.0 mi) in north. The current village of Harappa is 6 km (3.7 mi) from the ancient site. Although modern Harappa has a legacy railway station from the period of the British Raj, it is today just a small crossroads town of population 15,000." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harappa
The location of Harappa in relation to some other archaeological sites of Sarasvati Civilization may be seen on the present-day map.

What joys have men of ancient times or recent obtained within the chamber of libation? 2 In its wild joy Indra hath proved him faithful, faithful in quaffing, faithful in its friendship. His truth is the delight that in this chamber the men of old and recent times have tasted. 3 All thy vast power, O Maghavan, we know not, know not the riches of thy full abundance. No one hath seen that might of thine, productive of bounty every day renewed, O Indra. 4 This one great power of thine our eyes have witnessed, wherewith thou slewest Varasikhas' children, When by the force of thy descending thunder, at the mere solund, their boldest was demolished. 5 In aid of Abhyavartin Cayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha. At Hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the Vrcivans, and the rear fled frighted. 6 Three thousand, mailed, in quest of fame, together, on the Yavyavati, O muchsought- Indra, Vrcivans' sons, falling before the arrow, like bursting vessels went to their destruction. 7 He, whose two red Steers, seeking goodly pasture, plying their tongues move on twixt' earth and heaven, Gave Turvasa to SrÑjaya, and, to aid him, gave the Vrcivans up to Daivavata. 8 Two wagonteams-, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhyavartin Cayamdna, The liberal Sovran, giveth me.

westwards of the sons of उवणिी and Purūrávas. अमा--वसु is name of a prince (a descendant

Migrations are attested in Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra Chapter XVIII.44 contains an important reference attesting to the migrations of two groups of people away from Kurukshetra region (Sarasvati River basin).
Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra (BŚS 18.44)
Baudhāyana
Śrautasūtra refers to migrations to Gāndhāra, Parśu and Araṭṭa (raṭṭha, gujrāṭ).
etad āyavam. Pratyan amāvasus tasyaite gāndhārayas pārśavo raṭṭa ity, etad amāvasyavam (BŚS 18.44: 397.9 sqq.)
Translation: Ayu migrated eastwards. His (people) are the Kuru-Pancalas and the KasiVidehas. This is the Ayava (migration). Amāvasu migrated westwards. His (people) are the Gāndhāra, Parśu and Araṭṭa. This is the Amāvasu (migration).
Parśu is attested in RV 8.6.46. Thus, pārśava may signify parśa, ‘Persian’.



88
Gāndhāra is Bāhika (SB 1.7.8.3, MBh 8.2030).
If Gāndhāra is Badakshan (Afghanistan), Parśu is Gonur (Bactria-Margiana region) what is location of Araṭṭa? I suggest that
Araṭṭa is Gujarat. See:
Bhāratīya, itihāsa Araṭṭa is derived from rāṣṭrá > Lāṭa, land of Gurjara-s (evidence from R̥ gveda, Baudhāyana-Śrautasūtra) https://tinyurl.com/y94nfbhw

"Pratishthanapura or present day Paithān is said to be the capital of Mulaka desh. Aurangabad, Nashik, Jalna, Washim are parts of Mulaka. Mulukanadu follows the usual conjoint formulation of similar communities: the word Naadu means country in all the south Indian languages; this is suffixed to the country whence the community hails, being in this case "Muluka". Thus, Muluka+Naadu=Mulukanadu, "people of the Muluka land." Muluka or Mulaka is identified and it is also known as Moolaka or Moolaka desha along with Ashmaka.

7.018.01 Our forefathers, Indra, glorifying you, have obtained all desirable (riches); in your gift are cows easy to be milked, and horses, and you are the liberal donor of wealth to the devout. [tve = tvayi, in you]. 7.018.02 You dwell with your glories like a ra_ja_ with his wives; Maghavan, who are wise and experienced, (reward our) praises with the precious metals, with cows, with horses; conduct us who are dependent on your riches. [With the precious metals: pis'a_, silver or gold, and the like; ru_pen.a hiran.ya_dina_ va_; ru_pa may also mean beauty]. 7.018.03 These gratifying and pious hymns, emulous (in earnestness), are addressed on this occasion to you, may the path of your riches lead downwards; may we, Indra, (diligent) in your praise, enjoy felicity. 7.018.04 Desirous of milking you like a milch cow at pasture, Vasis.t.ha has let loose his prayers to you; every one of my people proclaims you the lord of cattle; may Indra be present at our praises. 7.018.05 The adorable Indra made the well-known deep waters (of the Parus.n.i) fordable for Suda_sa, and converted the vehement awakening imprecation of the sacrificer into the calumnation of the rivers. [Converted the vehement: sardhantam s'imyum uchahasya s'a_pam sindhu_na_m akr.n.od as'asti_h = utsahma_na_m bodhma_na_m stotuh s'a_pam abhis'asti_h sindhu_na_m akarot, he made the exerting awakening curse of the praiser the imprecations of the rivers; vis'varu_podbhavam a_tmano abhis'a_pam, the imprecation on his (Indra) has its birth in vis'varu_pa]. 7.018.06 Turvas'a, who was presiding (at solemn rites), diligent in sacrifice, (went to Suda_sa) for wealth; but like fishes restricted (to the element of water), the Bhrigus and Druhyus quickly assailed them; of these two everywhere going the friend (of Suda_sa, Indra) rescued his friend. [The legend: Indra saves one of the two, Suda_sa (and perhaps slays the other), turvas'am avadhi_t; matsyaso nis'itah, fishes limited to water; the people of the country Matsya were attacked by Turvas'a, tena matsyajanapada ba_dhitah; s'rus.t.im cakruh (applied to the Bhrigus) = as'upra_ptim cakruh; sukham turvas'asys cakruh-- making the Bhrigus and Druhyus the allies of Turvas'a]. 7.018.07 Those who dress the oblation, those who pronounce auspicious words, those who abstain from penance, those who bear horns (in their hands), those who bestow happiness (on the world by sacrifice), glorify that Indra, who recovered the cattle of the Arya from the plunderers, who slew the enemies in battle. [Those who dress: Denominations of the persons assisting at religious rites are: 1. paktha_sah, havis.am pa_cakah, cooks of the butter offered in oblation; 2. bhala_nasah, bhadra va_cinah, speakers of that which is lucky; 3. alina_sah, tapobhir apravr.ddhah, not eminent by austerities; 4. vis.a_n.inah, having black horns in their hands for the purpose of scratching kan.d.uyana_rtham, the same as di_ks.itah, having undergone the preliminary purification called di_ks.a; 5. s'iva_sah, ya_ga_dina_ sarvasya lokasya s'ivakarah, the makers happy of all people by sacrifice and the like]. 7.018.08 The evil-disposed and stupid (enemies of Suda_sa), crossing the humble Parus.n.i river, have broken down its banks; but he by his greatness pervades the earth, and Kavi, the son of Ca_yamana, like a falling victim, sleeps (in death). [Sleeps in death: killed Suda_sa]. 7.018.09 The waters followed their regular course to the Parus.n.i, nor (wandered) beyond it; the quick courser (of the king) came to the accessible places, and Indra made the idly-talking enemies, with their numerous progeny, subject among men (to Suda_sa). [Indra is said to have repaired the banks of the river so that the waters -- iyur artham na nyartham-- went to their object, that is, their former bed, not below or beyond it; the enemies Amitra_n are called



96
vadhriva_cah or jalpaka_n]. 7.018.10 They who ride on particoloured cattle, (the Maruts), despatched by Pr.s.n.i and recalling the engagement made by them with their friend (Indra), came like cattle from the pasturage, when left without a herdsman; the exulting Niyut steeds brought them quickly (against the foe). 7.018.11 The hero Indra created the Maruts (for the assistance of the ra_ja_), who, ambitious of fame, slew one-and-twenty of the men on the two banks (of the Parus.n.i), as a welllooking priest lops the sacred grass in the chamber of sacrifice. 7.018.12 You, the bearer of the thunderbolt, did drown S'ruta, Kavas.a, Vr.ddha and afterwards Druhyu, in the waters; for they, Indra, who are devoted to you, and glorify you, preferring your friendship, enjoy it. 7.018.13 Indra, in his might, quickly demolished all their strongholds, and their seven (kinds of) cities; he has given the dwelling of the son of Anu to Tr.tsu; may we, (by propitiating Indra), conquer in battle the ill-speaking man. [Seven kinds of cities: purah sapta, seven cities; nagai_h sapta praka_rah or pra_ka_ra_h, seven-walled; conquer in battle: jes.ma pu_rum manus.yam mr.dhrava_cam, speaking imperfectly or barbarously; or baddhava_cam, whose speech is threatening, obstructing or adverse]. 7.018.14 The warriors of the Anus and Druhyus, intending (to carry off the) cattle, (hostile) to the pious (Suda_sa) perished to the number of sixty-six thousand six hundred and sixty; such are all the glorious acts of Indra. [Sixty-thousand: s.as.t.ih s'ata s'at. sahasra s.as.t.ir adhi s'at. = sixty hundreds, six thousands, sixty, with six more; s'ata_ni = thousands, sahasra_ni_tyartham]. 7.018.15 These hostile, Tr.tsus, ignorantly contending with Indra, fled routed as rapidly as rivers on a downward course, and being discomfited, abandoned all their possessions to Suda_sa. 7.018.16 Indra has scattered over the earth the hostile rival of the hero (Suda_sa), the senior of Indra, the appropriator of the oblation; Indra has baffled the wrath of the wratfhful enemy, and the (foe) advancing on the way (against Suda_sa) has taken the path of flight. 7.018.17 Indra, has effected a valuable (donation) by a pauper; he has slain an old lion by a goat; he has cut the angles of the sacrificial post with a needle; he has given all the spoils (of the enemy) to Suda_sa. [Indra has effected: the three impossible acts are illustrative of the wonderful power of Indra]. 7.018.18 Your numerous enemies, Indra, have been reduced to subjection, effect at some time or other the subjugation of the turbulent Bheda, who holds men praising you as guilty of wickedness; hurl, Indra, your sharp thuderbolt against him. [Bheda: one who breaks or separates; may mean an unbeliever, a na_stika; or, the name of the enemy of Suda_sa]. 7.018.19 The dwellers on the Yamuna and the Tr.tsus glorified Indra when he killed Bheda in battle; the Ajas, the S'igrus, the Yaks.as, offered him as a sacrifice the heads of the horses (killed in the combat). [Offered to him: balim s'i_rs.a_n.i jabhrur as'vya_ni : they represented the best horses, taken; bali may also have the import of a sacrifice]. 7.018.20 Your favours, Indra, and your bounties, whether old or new, cannot be counted like the (recurring) dawn; you have slain Devaka, the son of Ma_nyama_na, and of thine own will, has cast down S'ambara from the vast (mountain). 7.018.21 Para_s'ara, the destroyer of hundreds (of ra_ks.asas), and Vasis.t.ha they who, devoted to you, have glorified you in every dwelling, neglect not the friendship of you (their) benefactor; therefore prosperous days dawn upon the pious. [The destroyer: s'ataya_tu, that



97
is, s'akti, the son of Vasis.t.ha, the father of Para_s'ara (Vis.n.u Pura_n.a 8.4)]. 7.018.22 Praising the liberality of Suda_sa, the grandson of Devavat, the son of Paijavana, the donor of two hundred cows, and of two chariots with two wives, I, worthy (of the gift), circumambulate you, Agni, like the ministrant priest in the chamber (of sacrifice). 7.018.23 Four (horses), having golden trappings, going steadily on a difficult road, celebrated on the earth, the excellent and acceptable gifts (made) to me by Suda_sa, the son of Paijavana, bear me as a son (to obtain) food and progeny. [The excellent: smaddis.t.ayah, an epithet of as'vah: prasa'sta_tisarjana_ s'raddha_dida_na_n:gayukta_, being or having part of a donation made in the belief of presenting what is excellent]. 7.018.24 The seven worlds praise (Suda_sa) as if he were Indra; him whose fame (spreads) through the spacious heaven and earth; who, munificent, has distributed (wealth) on every eminent person, and (for him) the flowing (rivers) have destroyed Yudhyamadhi in war. 7.018.25 Maruts, leaders (of rites), attend upon this (prince) as you did upon Divoda_sa, the father of Suda_sa; favour the prayers of the devout son of Pijavana, and may his strength be unimpaired, undecaying].
Griffith translation RV 7.18:
1. ALL is with thee, O Indra, all the treasures which erst our fathers won who sang thy praises. With thee are milchkine- good to milk, and horses: best winner thou of riches for the pious. 2 For like a King among his wives thou dwellest: with glories, as a Sage, surround and help us. Make us, thy servants, strong for wealth, and honour our songs wirth kine and steeds and decoration. 3 Here these our holy hymns with joy and gladness in pious emulation have approached thee. Hitherward come thy path that leads to riches: may we find shelter in thy favour, Indra. 4 Vasistha hath poured forth his prayers, desiring to milk thee like a cow in goodly pasture. All these my people call thee Lord of cattle: may Indra. come unto the prayer we offer. 5 What though the floods spread widely, Indra made them shallow and easy for Sudas to traverse. He, worthy of our praises, caused the Simyu, foe of our hymn, to curse the rivers' fury. 6 Eager for spoil was Turvasa Purodas, fain to win wealth, like fishes urged by hunger. The Bhrgus and the Druhyus quickly listened: friend rescued friend mid the two distant peoples. 7 Together came the Pakthas, the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the Visanins. Yet to the Trtsus came the Aryas' Comrade, through love of spoil and heroes' war, to lead them. 8 Fools, in their folly fain to waste her waters, they parted inexhaustible Parusni. Lord of the Earth, he with his might repressed them: still lay the herd and the affrighted herdsman. 9 As to their goal they sped to their destruetion: they sought Parusni; even the swift returned not. Indra abandoned, to Sudas the manly, the swiftly flying foes, unmanly babblers. 10 They went like kine unherded from the pasture, each clinging to a friend as chance directed. They who drive spotted steeds, sent down by Prsni, gave ear, the Warriors and the harnessed



98
horses. 11 The King who scattered oneandtwenty— people of both Vaikarna tribes through lust of gloryAs the skilled priest clips grass within the chamber, so hath the Hero Indra, wrought their downfall. 12 Thou, thunderarmed-, overwhelmedst in the waters famed ancient Kavasa and then the Druhyu. Others here claiming friendship to their friendship, devoted unto thee, in thee were joyful. 13 Indra at once with conquering might demolished all their strong places and their seven castles. The goods of Anus' son he gave to Trtsu. May we in sacrifice conquer scorned Puru. 14 The Anavas and Druhyus, seeking booty, have slept, the sixty hundred, yea, six thousand, And sixandsixty— heroes. For the pious were all these mighty exploits done by Indra. 15 These Trtsus under Indras' careful guidance came speeding like loosed waters rushing downward. The foemen, measuring exceeding closely, abandoned to Sudas all their provisions. 16 The heros' side who drank the dressed oblation, Indras' denier, far over earth he scattered. Indra brought down the fierce destroyers' fury. He gave them various roads, the paths' Controller. 17 even with the weak he wrought this matchless exploit: even with a goat he did to death a lion. He pared the pillars' angles with a needle. Thus to Sudas Indra gave all provisions. 18 To thee have all thine enemies submitted: even the fierce Bheda hast thou made thy subject. Cast down thy sharpened thunderbolt, O Indra, on him who harms the men who sing thy praises. 19 Yamuna and the Trtsus aided Indra. There he stripped Bheda bare of all his treasures. The Ajas and the Sigrus and the Yaksus brought in to him as tribute heads of horses. 20 Not to be scorned, but like Dawns past and recent, O Indra, are thy favours and thy riches. Devaka, Manyamanas' son, thou slewest, and smotest Sambara from the lofty mountain. 21 They who, from home, have gladdened thee, thy servants Parasara, Vasistha, Satayatu, Will not forget thy friendship, liberal Giver. So shall the days dawn prosperous for the princes. 22 Priestlike-, with praise, I move around the altar, earning Paijavanas' reward, O Agni, Two hundred cows from Devavans' descendant, two chariots from Sudas with mares to draw them. 23 Gift of Paijavana, four horses bear me in foremost place, trained steeds with pearl to deck them. Sudass' brown steeds, firmlystepping-, carry me and my son for progeny and glory. 24 Him whose fame spreads between wide earth and heaven, who, as dispenser, gives each chief his portion, Seven flowing Rivers glorify like Indra. He slew Yudhyamadhi in close encounter. 25 Attend on him O ye heroic Maruts as on Sudass' father Divodasa. Further Paijavanas' desire with favour. Guard faithfully his lasting firm dominion.

"The Ravi River originates in the Himalayas in the Multhan tehsil of Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh, India. It follows a north-westerly course and is a perennial river. It is the smallest of the five Punjab rivers that rises from glacier fields at an elevation of 14,000 feet (4,300 m), on the southern side of the Mid Himalayas. It flows through Barabhangal, Bara Bansu and Chamba districts. It flows in rapids in its initial reaches with boulders seen scattered in the bed of the river. The Ravi River in this reach flows in a gorge with a river bed slope of 183 feet per mile (34.7 m/km) and is mostly fed by snow melt, as this region lies in a rain shadow. Two of its major tributaries, the Budhil and Nai or Dhona join 64 kilometres (40 mi) downstream from its source. The Budhil River rises in Lahul range of hills and is sourced from the Manimahesh Kailash Peak and the Manimahesh Lake, at an elevation of 4,080 metres (13,390 ft), and both are Hindu pilgrimage sites. The entire length of Budhil is 72 kilometres (45 mi) where it has a bed slope of 314 feet per mile (59.5 m/km). It flows through the ancient capital of Bharmwar, now known as Bharmour in Himachal Pradesh. During 1858–1860, the Raja of Bharmour had considered the Budhil valley as an excellent source of Deodar trees for supply to the British Raj. However, a part of the forest surrounding the temple was considered sacred and declared a reserved area. The second tributary, the Nai, rises at Kali Debi pass, and flows for 48 kilometres (30 mi), with a bed slope of 366 feet per mile (69.3 m/km), from its source at Trilokinath to its confluence with the Ravi. This valley was also exploited for its forest wealth during the English period...Another major tributary that joins the Ravi River, just below Bharmour, the old capital of Chamba, is the Seul River from the northern direction. The valley formed by the river was also exploited for its rich timber trees. However, the valley has large terraces, which are very fertile and known as "the garden of Chamba". crops grown here supply grains to the capital region and to Dalhousie town and its surrounding areas. One more major tributary that joins the Ravi River near Bissoli is the Siawa. This river was also exploited for its forest resources, (controlled by the then Raja of Chamba) originating from the Jammu region. The valley is also formed by another major tributary that joins Seul River, the Baira-Nalla. Its sub-basin is in the Chamba district, located above Tissa. Baira drains the southern slopes of the Pir Panjal Range. The valley has an elevation variation between 5,321 metres (17,457 ft) and 2,693 metres (8,835 ft)"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_River

"According to satellite imagery studies carried out over a period of 20 years (between 19721973 and 1991–1993), the river coursing along the India–Pakistan border meanders substantially in the alluvial plains of the Amritsar, pathankot and Gurdaspur districts of Punjab. This has resulted in successive damage in the Indian Territory as a result of the river changing its course towards India. The reason attributed to this change in the course of the river is massive river training structures/bunds constructed by Pakistan in its part of the river, close to the old course of the river. The shift in the course of the river is reported to be 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) towards India." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_River
The shift of ravi river and the geomorphological features along its course in amritsar and gurdaspur districts of punjab
Abraham Thomas & PK Sharma
Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing volume 26, pages57–68(1998)
Abstract
Satellite remote sensing technique can be effectively utilised in mapping and monitoring the river course changes and associated geomorphological features. Ravi river, flowing along the Indo-Pakistan border, has been in the limelight for its repeated flood havoc during monsoon and abrupt encroachment at some places in the Indian territory, where it was not flowing earlier. This river, meandering in zig-zag fashion along the International boundary in Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts of Punjab, poses perennial threats to the nations’s economy due to extensive destruction happening every year. An attempt has been made to map the shift of this river and the associated geomorphological features along its course using the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite data (IRS-IA and IB LISS-IIFCC) of the period 1991–1993 and the Survey of India topographic sheets of the period 1972–1973. The study shows that there has been drastic changes in the course of Ravi during a span of 20 years due to human activities along its course. The river has shifted its course considerably towards India since its topography is against it. River training structures/bundhs, built by the neighbouring country, across and very near to the earlier river course has been the main reason for this drastic shifting. It is estimated that such massive structures could turn the river course towards India by atleast 1 to 5 km in the border districts of Punjab. This shifting of Ravi along international border poses a serious threat to the Nation’s defence system. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03007340

Tuisto, Founder of the Germanic People (according to Tacitus)



113
Tuiscon (Tuisto) as depicted in a German broadside by Nikolaus Stör c. 1543, with a caption by Burkard Waldis.
Meyer considers Tuisto and Tvaṣṭṛ of Rigveda to be identical. [Meyer (1907) sees the connection as so strong, that he considers the two to be identical.( Meyer (1907): referenced in : North, Richard (1997). Heathen Gods in Old English Literature. Cambridge University Press.(p.269)] Tuisto is described as being "celebrated" (celebrant) by the early Germanic peoples in song, with Tacitus reporting nothing negative about Tuisto. (Lindow, John. (2001) Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs, p. 296).
Tacitus' reference to Mannus as the son of Tuisto is instructive and jibes with the Indian tradition of Manu as a form of Tvasta together with Maya, Silpi and Visvajna. Vishvakarma [ God ] created five prajapathies — from his five faces such as Sadyojāta,Vāmadeva,



114
Aghora,Tatpuruṣha,Īsāna.[11] They are Manu, Maya, Tvasta, Silpi, Visvajna. These memories among the people is so strong that the narrative of Tacitus about Tuisto may indeed be a recollected memory of Tvaṣṭṛ and also Visvakarma of Rigveda It is no mere accident that both Tvaṣṭṛ and Visvakarma of Rigveda are related as the divinities venerated by artisans, artificers, smiths who make vajra, the thunderbolt and other weapons and metal implements.
These narratives are evidence validating Indus Script Corpora as catalogus catalogorum of metalwork, together with archaeometallurgical evidences, say, recovered from Chanhu-daro.
These narratives together with the evidence of Gundestrup Cauldron with Indus Script hieroglyphs may be evidence of migrations of Bharatam Janam into Europe establishing contacts with Germanic peoples described in Tacitus' Germania.
The links of Mleccha (Meluhha) with Germanic people of Germania date to ca. 3rd millennium BCE.

Tuisto was Tvaṣṭṛ of Rigveda who produced the metal weapon: vajra, the thunderbolt. The divinity Tvaṣṭṛ is mentioned in the Mitanni treaty, which establishes him as a Proto-IndoIranian divinity. Tvaṣṭr is Śukrācārya's son, Śukrācārya (the weapons' mentor of the asura) is Bhṛgu's grandson and Vāruṇibhṛgu's son. Tvaṣṭr is the father of ViŚvarupa.
See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/06/tvasta-metal-artificer-was-meluhha.html This
includes RV 10.90 which identifies Tvaṣṭṛ (Sanskrit: त्वष्टृ ) is the first born creator of the universe. Also included is RV 10.82 which venerates Visvakarman n associations with V ̥rtra and Dadhici, episodes later elaborated in Bhagavata Purana. See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2015/06/tvastr-is-metaphor-for-venerationof.html Tvaṣṭ ̥r is a metaphor for veneration of metalwork artificers, Bhāratam Janam, in Rigveda. RV 1.80.16 refers to Dadhyanc, son of Atharvan; RV 1.80.1 refers to Indra wielding the metal vajra thunderbolt weapon against VRtra. RV 1.85.9 refers to Indra slaying VRtra using the vajra made by TvaSTA and releasing the water of oceans. RV 1.32.1, RV 1.32.5 to 14, RV 1.52.2 to 15, RV 1.61.6 to 12, RV 1.80.3 to 5, RV 1.80, 3 to 13, RV 1.85.9, RV 1.86.6, RV 2.1.11, RV 3.54.15, RV 4.42.7, RV 6.47.2, RV 10.48.8, RV 10.65.2, RV 10.65.10, RV 10.66.8 also refers to Indra's battle against VRtra and as the slayer of VRtra. The gloss vRTrhA of RV 2.1.11 is also explained by Sayana as 'destroyer of sin'.
These references reinforce the role of Tvaṣṭā as a metal artificer who made metallic weapons. This gets elaborated in a narrative in the Bhagavata Purana related to a son of Tvaṣṭā called Vis'varupa who was killed in battle.
There is a remarkable episode of mispronunciation by Tvaṣṭā, making him a mleccha. This mispronunciation with a wrong accent on the phrase: Indra-śatro resulted in the birth of V ̥rtra who, instead of becoming a slayer of Indra, gets killed in battle by Indra.
"The sagas, which are the sole record of their past history, say that the God Tuisto (Or Tuisco, the deity that gives its name to Tuesday)sprang from the earth, and that he and his son Mannus were the authors and founders of the race. To Mannus they ascribe three sons, whose names are borne respectively by the Ingaevones["Grimm's identification of the Ingaevones with the Saxons, of the Iscaevones with the Franks, and of the Herminones with the Thuringians is convenient " (Stubbs, Const. Hist., i. 38]mext to the ocean, the Herminones in the middle of the countiy, and the Iscaevones in the rest of it. Others, with true mythological license, give the deity several more sons, from whom are derived more tribal names, such as Marsians, Gambrivians, Suabians, and Vandals ; and these names are both genuine and ancient. The name Germany, however, is new and of recent application, owing to the fact that the first of these peoples to cross the Rhine and dispossess the Gauls, a tribe now known as the Tungrians, then got the name of "Germans". Thus what was originally a name given to a tribe and not that of a race gradually came to be accepted, so that all men of the race were called Germans, by the victorious tribe first as a name of fear, and by themselves afterwards when the name had once been coined.

"While the gods Indra and Agni stood for Power and Wisdom, the gods PUSan and Bhaga, Rbhus, TvaSTA and Vis'vakarman presided over the economic activities of the people. The technical and the ritual aspects of productive activity were closely united just as the forms of wealth were conceived in close connection with the favour of the gods...All rUpas are of TvaSTA (the divine fashioner). TvaSTA inherited them from Agni or, as Aitareya has it, TvaSTA is nothing but speech. In other words, all forms are originally contained in divine wisdom, the ultimate illuminer. It is from there that the artificing and fashioning mind derives them. Reality is conceived as a luminous powere which creates things or forms out of itself. The human mind is capable of responding to the Light and apperceiving the forms in which it expresses itself. The forms which man perceives, thus, are not phantasms produced by the senses or the mind but created things rooted in reality."(Pande, GC, 1990, Foundations of
Indian culture: spiritual vision and symbolic forms, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, p.61, p.344)
"According to the Bhagavat Purana, he chanted: “Indra-satro vivardhasva ma ciram jahi vidvisam” (“O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your enemy without delay”). (Bhagavat Purana 6.9.11). Tvasta intended to chant the word indra-satro, meaning, “O enemy of Indra.” Instead of chanting those words short, Tvasta chanted it long, and its meaning changed from “the enemy of Indra” to “Indra, who is an enemy.” Consequently, instead of a son who would kill the king of the gods, he had a son who would die at Indra’s hands. The smallest mistake in

TRANSLATION
After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed ritualistic ceremonies to kill Indra. He offered oblations in the sacrificial fire, saying, "O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your ene my without delay."
PURPORT
There was some defect in Tvasta's chanting of the mantra because he chanted it long instead of short, and therefore the meaning changed. Tvasta intended to chant the word indra-satro, m eaning, "O enemy of Indra." In this mantra, the word indra is in the possessive case (sasthi), a nd the word indra-satro is called a tat-purusa compound (tatpurusa-samasa) . Unfortunately, i nstead of chanting the mantra short, Tvasta chanted it long, and its meaning changed from "th e enemy of Indra" to "Indra, who is an enemy." Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra's, there emerged the body of Vrtrasura, of whom Indra was the enemy.
Bhag. 6.9.11
In the compound word indra-satro, the ending of the word satro is uttered short when it is in t he possessive case (sasthi) and long when it is in the vocative case (sambodhana) . Tvasta mis takenly uttered it long. He expected "Indra's killer" to be born from the sacrifice, but the mant ra he uttered meant "Indra is the killer of the person to be born."
In the above scenario, "long" and "short" do not denote dirgha and hrasva (see section 2.4.2 o n vowels), but long (udatta) and short (anudatta) pitch accents on vowels (also in 2.4.2). Tvas ta spoke Vedic Sanskrit (vaidika bhasa or vaidika samskrta), in which the word meaning can change depending on the pitch in which a vowel is accented. Vedic Sanskrit occurs only in th e sruti-sastra, the four Vedas, and it is also called srauta bhasa. The rest of Sanskrit literature i s written in classical Sanskrit (laukika bhasa or laukika samskrta), which is not altered by vo wel pitch accents.
The commentaries by Sridhara Svami and Varhsidhara on Bhagavatam 6.9.11 explain this inc ident in more detail. They say that the version of the mantra given in 6.9.11 is different from t he mantra used by Tvasta. The mantra given in the Vedas and described by Sridhara Svami a nd Vamsidhar was indra-satrur vardhasva, and their explanations of the mistake are based on this. It was customary to change a Vedic mantra a bit when mentioning sruti texts in writing b ecause the audience did not necessarily have qualifications (adhikara) in sruti. Hence the man tra from the Veda was changed in 6.9.11. Or it was changed owing to considerations of the ve rse meter. Hence we see that there is no actual vocative in the Vedic mantra. Sridhara Svami mentions that the mistake was in the svaras, vowel pitch accents. As far as the letters were co ncerned, they were accurately chanted. The mistake in the svaras (vowel pitch accents) was th



118
at he chanted "indra" with the udatta accent, which changed it from what was intended (a tatp urusa meaning "Indra's enemy") to something else (a bahuvrihi) meaning Tndra is the killer of the person to be born." [unquote]

Vritra is also mentioned in the Rig Veda, where he is the demon of drought, who imprisons all the strom clouds and causes drought. Indra slays him with his thunder-bolt (Vajra) and frees the strom-clouds, bring bountiful rain to end the famine.
Slaying of Vritra
This story is taken from B.P. and Bhagavata Purana (Canto 6, Chapter 7-13). Brihaspati was the Guru of the Devas. He was very learned and was first among the Brahmanas. Everyone used to respect him. It so happened, that when he visited the court of Indra, the King of the Gods was busy watching his beautiful Apsaras sing and dance, saw his Guru arrive. However, in his arrogance, he did not rise from his throne, nor did he utter the customary words of welcome and worship.
The sage felt insulted. He resolved that he will no longer grace the councils of the Devas, and went away to perform penance. Too late, Indra realized his mistake. H searched high and low for his perceptor, but could not find him. Without their Guru to guide them, the Devas could not survive for long. Besides, their traditional foes, the Asuras, will seek to exploit this opportunity to and cash in on their weakened state.
Acting on the advice of Lord Brahma, the Devas installed Vishwarupa, the son of the God Tvashta as their new Guru. He was also a Brahmana renowned for his learning and yogic power. As time progressed, Vishwarupa started to notice that Indra and the Devas spent an inordinate amount of time in pursuit of pleasure. Besides, his mother was aAsura woman, and his loyalty was divided. Secretly, he started giving a portion of the sacrificial oblations (Havis) to the Asuras. As a result, their strength increased.
When Indra came to know of this treachery, he became very angry. Without pausing to think the consequences of his actions, he struck off the three heads of Vishwarupa. The first head, that was used for drinking Soma, became a francolin partridge, the second head, used for drinking wine turned into a sparrow and the third, used for eating, turned into a partridge. the head of his teacher with his sword. Since he had killed a Brahmana, that too his Guru, he became guilty of the sin of Brahma-Hatya. However, he escaped his punishment by distributing the sin among the land, water, and women. (Other accounts say that his lustre diminished and he had to regain it by doing penance, during which time he was exiled from heaven.) In return for ridding Indra of the sin, earth got water to fill its empty holes, trees got re-growth of cut branches, waters became purifying, and women obtained undiminished sexual desire. As a result of their share of the sin, earth has wastelands, trees have sap, waters have froth, and women have menstruation.
Now, Tvashta wanted revenge for the murder of his son. He began arrangements for a sacrifice that would give him a son who could slay Indra. The sacrifice was duly performed,



119
but there was a small problem. When it was time for the final incantations, Tvashta ought to have said, "May this son of mine be the slayer of Indra", but he stressed the wrong syllables in the Mantra, and the meaning changed to "May Indra be the slayer of this son of mine." From the sacrificial fire, there rose a terrible Asura. He was named Vritra, 'the encloser'. He immediately grew immensely big and was as large as the largest mountain. His hair was like molten copper, he had a mustache and beard of the same color and had eyes blazing like the midday sun. He was armed with a magical trident. He derived his immense strength from the incantations chanted at the sacrifice. His father then ordered him to go and slayIndra. Obedient to the command, the demon began to seek the slayer of his elder brother.
Some time before this, the Asuras had been thoroughly defeated by the Devas in battle. Peace reigned for a while. The Devas needed a place to store their weapons safely, for they feared treachery. They then remembered that the Asuras dared not approach the hermitage of the sage Dadhichi, such was the yogic power of the hermit. They entrusted all their weapons to his safekeeping.
When Dadhichi's wife Lopamudra came to know about this, she was not pleased. She said to her husband, "An ascetic should not take sides in a war. Now the Asuras will think that you are their enemy and seek to harm you. Besides, the Gods have not mentioned how long you are to take care of their weapons. If something were to happen to them in your custody, will they not blame you. We have renounced all worldly possessions and attachments, you were wrong to have taken this responsibility."
Dadhichi saw the force of her arguments. He said, "What you say certainly makes sense. However, I have given my word. It is important to stand by ones promise. Besides, the Asuras were always the enemies of us sages, so the question of neutrality does not arise. What is fated will happen, and no one prevent it."
Years passed, and Dadhichi was alarmed to note that the lustre of the divine weapons was beginning to diminish. Their power was slowly dissolving in air. The sage then used his yogic power to dissolve all the weapons in water and then he drank it all up. Their power was then lodged in his bones.
Now, with Vritra threatening at their doorsteps, the Devas wanted their weapons back. Dadhichi said, "I have bad news for you. Your weapons are no longer there. Their power now resides in my bones. I shall give up my life. You can then have new weapons made from my bones."
The Gods naturally balked at the thought of the Rishi's death. However, no other choice was available, for they needed the weapons to battle Vritra. Dadhichi gave up his life. Vishwakarma made Indra the weapon Vajra from the back bone of the hermit. This weapon was the most powerful weapon of all.
The armies of the Devas and Asuras met in the battlefield. From the furious onslaught of the Asura army, theDevas were initially driven back, but they redoubled their efforts and slowly gained the upper hand.



120
Seeing his forces retreating, Vritra was extremely angry. He charged ahead and stopped the advance of the Devas single-handedly. He let out a mighty roar, which caused many of the Devas to faint. Under his purposeful tread, the heavens began to shake. He picked up his immense mace and struck Iyravata with it. Indra revived his mount with a touch of Amrit.
At this point, angry words were exchanged between Vritra and Indra.
The Asura taunted Indra for having slain his brother, a defenseless Brahmana.
Angered, Indra struck off one hand of Vritra with his sword. In retaliation, theAsura made his mouth immensely huge and swallowed Indra whole.
Though he was swallowed by the Asura, Indra did not die, for he was protected by the grace of Vishnu. He judged it to be time to use his Vajra. He used the great weapon and sliced open the abdomen of the demon, and emerged victorious.
However, having slain the creature emerged from a holy sacrifice, he was once again weighed down with sin. Unlike before, he could not get rid of it easily. He retired to the banks of Manasarovar and performed a penance for thousand years to expiate his sins and to regain his lustre.

Baṛhai (Garhwālī), Baḍagi (Kannada), Vaḍlavāḍu (Telugu), Tuisco, Tuisto (Germans), Tarkh an (Turkic), Dhiman are Proto-Indo-European divine artificers,, emphatically attested in Bhāratiya samskṛti (culture), language, religion, art, music, poetry and Itihāsa traditions.

The veneration of the artificers as divine is a millennial cultural phenomenon which is identified with Proto-Indo-European people. It is a false dichotomy to separate these people from Dravidian or Austro-asiatic groups of speakers because Bharat has been and continues to be a sprachbund (linguistic area), a language union with dialects and languages sharing common features and absorbing many linguistic features as their own. This has been demonstrated in the rebus Meluhha readings of thousands of inscriptions of Indus Script Corpora as metalwork, artificer catalogues.

Artificers have only false subaltern imagined identities (foisted by motivated academics, leftist liberals in particular) such as dalit, SC/ST/OBC to lose.
A recent book, [Christina Lee (German) and Nicola McLelland (Englidh)(Co-eds.),
2013, Germania Remembered 1500-2009, Commemorating and Inventing a Germanic Past, ACMRS Publications]
"examines how German, English and Scandinavianscholars, writers and artists have invoked the remote history of Germany in order to bolster their ideas about what it meant to be German (or Germanic)...(essays) show how various aspects of ancient Germanic society its language, religion, laws, music, poetry, and historical figures, such as Hermann/Arminius — have been reimagined in Germany and beyond, in areas ranging from theatre and art to history, from musical theory to regional culture, philology to popular literature. There is much to educate but also to entertain here: from the use of Danish cave paintings as evidence that the Germanic tribes invented polyphonic music, to the seventeenth-century belief that all properly Germanic words have only one syllable, to the tracing of English democracy to Germanic origins."

ترخان ; Chinese: 達干; Arabic: طرخان ; alternative spellings Tarkan, Tarkhaan,
Tarqan, Tarchan, Turxan, Tarcan, Tárkány, Tarján, Torgyán or Turgan) is an
ancient Central Asian title used by various Turkic peoples, Indo
Europeans (i.e. Iranian, Tokharian, Punjabi), and by the proto
Mongols, Hungarians and Mongols. Its use was common among the successors of
the Mongol Empire... one of the Magyar (Hungarian) tribes was called Tarjan (Ταριάνου)
according to Constantin VII's De Administrando Imperio, dated centuries earlier. Also this
name is commonly used for settlements throughout Hungary, and used as a family name. A.
Alemany gives the additional elaboration that the related East Iranian Scythian (and Alanic)
word *tarxan still survives in Ossetic tærxon ("argument, trial") and tærxon kænyn ("to



124
judge"). Harold Walter Bailey also proposes an Iranian (Khotanese Saka) root for the
word, L. Rogers bears in mind that the word may have originated among
the Xiongnu and Huns where it was associated with a title for nobility. Edwin G.
Pulleyblank also suggests that both, Turkic tarqan and Mongolian darxan/daruyu, may
preserve an original Hunnic word. The word was borrowed by many languages, including
Armenian tʿarxan, Georgian t’arxani and Russian тархан through the Mongolian
conquests...A tarkhan established the Tarkhan dynasty, which ruled North India from 1554
91. All craftsmen held the status of darkhan and were immune to occasional requisitions
levied incessantly by passing imperial envoys.

From then on, the word referred to
craftsmen or blacksmiths

in the Mongolian language now and is still used in Mongolia as
privilege.

People who served the Khagan's orda were granted the title of darkhan and their
descendants are known as the darkhad in Ordos City, Inner Mongolia."

Imagining of German divinity Tuisco is concordant with the cognate with Tvaṣṭ ̥r, artificer divinity in Rigveda (and also, TakSa with etyma related to carpenters as artificers). Deutsch, then Teutsch, the word for German language of 17th century is said to be rooted in this divinity. The Roman historian, Tacitus’ account which names Tuisto/Tuisco as the Father/Founder of the Germanic Peoples, is the framework for tracing the origins of German language and Germanic people.

Piece of waste limestone. Accounts, in black ink, by workmen of the number of stone blocks delivered for the Meidum Pyramid. 4th Dynasty. From Pyramid waste, mastaba 17 at Meidum, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London
Mastaba in Arabic means a 'stone bench or bench of mud'. Mastabas pre-date the pyramids. Mastaba "or "pr-djt" (meaning "house for eternity" or "eternal house" in Ancient Egyptian), is a type of ancient Egyptian tomb in the form of a flat-roofed, rectangular structure with inward sloping sides, constructed out of mud-bricks (from the Nile River) or stone...Mastabas evolved over early dynastic period. During the 1st Dynasty (3218-3035 BCE), a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings." (Dee, M.; Wengrow, D.; Shortland, A.; Stevenson, A.; Brock, F.; Girdland Flink, L.; Bronk Ramsey, C. (4 September 2013). "An absolute chronology for early Egypt using radiocarbon dating and Bayesian statistical modelling". Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences. 469 (2159): 20130395–20130395. loc.cit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastaba)
Example of a mastaba
"Tarkhan is an Ancient Egyptian necropolis, located around 50 km south of Cairo on the west bank of the Nile. The cemetery was excavated in two seasons by Flinders Petrie. Tombs of almost all periods were found, but most importantly many belonging to the time of Egyptian state formation, the Early Dynastic period around 3100 BC. Petrie found more than 2,000 tombs, most of them simple holes in the ground belonging to common people. However, there were also several mastabas of the First Dynasty, decorated with a palace facade.The most important finds include a tomb with many seal impressions belonging to king Narmer and one of the oldest dresses found in Egypt. The cemeteries of the later periods are called Kafr Ammar, although lying side by side with the earlier tombs. From a Roman period tomb came a Fayum portrait." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkhan_(Egypt)

The Tarkhan Dress (courtesy Petrie Museum/UCL) "The V-neck dress is on view at the University College London (UCL) Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, with its flax fiber linen stitched carefully over a modern silk shirt, so as to exhibit it in its intended dimensions...An over-5,000-year-old linen dress was recently confirmed as the world’s oldest woven garment. The Tarkhan Dress, named for the Tarkhan cemetery south of Cairo in Egypt where it was excavated, had a long road to its title, from its use as clothing and then a shroud, and later being lost amidst a grimy bundle of overlooked textile...University of Oxford affirms, with 95% accuracy, that the dress dates from between 3482 and 3102 BCE. Alice Stevenson, curator at the Petrie Museum, and Michael W. Dee, who led the Oxford testing, published their study in the Antiquity review, writing that due “to its association with a First Dynasty tomb, as well as Naqada IIIC1-type stone vessels, the Tarkhan Dress (as it became known) has been claimed to be Egypt’s oldest garment and the oldest extant woven garment in the world. In the absence of a secure context, however, its date has been contentious.” https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/petrie/about/collections/objects/tarkhan -dress http://hyperallergic.com/279242/a-5000-year-old-linen-dress-is-the-worlds-oldest-wovengarment/
The Ramgarhia are a community of Sikhs from the Punjab region of northwestern India. Sikh carpenters use Ramgarhia as a surname whereas Hindu carpenters use Dhiman. (Paramjit S. Judge, Gurpreet Bal, 1996, Strategies of Social Change in India. M. D. Publications. p. 54.)

Jassa Singh Ramgarhia (1723–1803) was a prominent Sikh leader during the period of the Sikh Confederacy. He was the Commander of the Ramgarhia Misl (or Confederacy).
The traditional occupation of the Tarkhan people was that of carpentry.(Singha, H. S. (2005) [2000]. The Encyclopaedia of Sikhism (2nd ed.). Hemkunt. p. 111.)

Hiraṇya-garbha is Viśwákarma, artificer, works with hirañña-suvaṇṇaŋ gold & money
hiraṇya-garbha is Brahma, the creator. He is Viśwákarma. An early inquiry into this phenomenon of gold as a metal links it to a divine phenomenon of creation which has resulted in the creation of this metal as a unique material qualities of least reactive (resistant to most acids) chemical element -- symbol Au (from Latin: aurum). The Proto-IndoEuropean ancestor of aurum was *h2é-h2us-o-, meaning "glow". "This word is derived from the same root (Proto-Indo-European *h2 ̯ues- "to dawn") as *h2é ̯usōs, the ancestor of the Latin word Aurora, 'dawn'." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold

This manuscript was painted for the Mughal emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605) who was quite interested in other religions.

"Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides)...Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presenc Until 1930, gold was the standard for currency systems of the world.

त्वष्टटृ Tvaṣṭṛ 'the heavenly builder' should have been a Divinity Meluhha, he mispronounces
इन्द्र -िुत्र indraśatru
Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/h778h3s
This monograph argues that त्वष्टटृ Tvaṣṭṛ 'the heavenly builder' is a Divinity who is a Meluhha



149
because he mispronounces the expression: इन्द्र -िुत्र indraśatru.
Meluhha is cognate mleccha. Mleccha were island-dwellers (attested in Mahabharata and other ancientIndian sprachbund texts). Their speech did not conform to the rules of grammar (mlecchāḥ mā bhūma iti adhyeyam
vyākaraṇam) and had dialectical variants or unrefined sounds in words (mlecchitavai na apabhāṣitavai) (Patañjali: Mahābhāṣya). Patañjali also refers to a specific instance of mispronunciation of the expression इन्द्र -िुत्र indraśatru which occurs in RV 1.32.6 with semantics, 'Indra's foe'.
RV 1.32.6 He, like a mad weak warrior, challenged Indra, the great impetuous manyslaying- Hero. He, brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed, Indras' foe, the shattered forts in falling.

So he performed a Homa [firesacrifice] chanting a mantra:'Indrassatrur vardhasva' . As a result of an error in pronunciation , the meaning got topsyturvy and the result was just contrary to what "Tvashta" wanted. His son was killed by Indra.
Written by Sri Swami ChandrashekHarendra Saraswati You must not go wrong either in the enunciation or intonation of a mantra. If you do, not only will you not gain the expected benefits from it, the result might well be contrary to what is intended. So the mantras must be chanted with the utmost care. There is a story told in the Taittiriya Samhita (2.4.12) to underline this. Tvasta wanted to take revenge on Indra for some reason and conducted a sacrifice to beget a son who would slay Indra. When he chanted his



150
mantra, "Indrasatrur varddhasva ", he went wrong in the intonation. He should have voiced "Indra" without raising or lowering the syllables in it and he should have raised the syllables "tru" and "rddha"(that is the two syllables are "udata"). Had he done so the mantra would have meant, "May Tvasta's son grow to be the slayer of Indra". He raised the "dra" in Indra, intoned "satru" as a falling svara and lowered the "rddha" in "varddhasva". So the mantra meant now: "May Indra grow to be the killer of this son (of mine)". The words of the mantra were not changed but, because of the erratic intonation, the result produced was the opposite of what was desired. The father himself thus became the cause of his son's death at the hands of Indra. The gist of this story is contained in this verse which cautions us against erroneous
intonation.

If the mantra differs by intonation, letter or another way while chanting, that mantra will become VajrAyudham(thunderbolt) and torment the YajamAnan(performer of sacrifice) who chants the mantra, just as the wrong recital of the 'indrashatru' phrase did.

Taittiriya Samhita 2.4.12



151
Vritra enveloped these worlds. Indra feared him. Tvastri dipped his bolt for him; the bolt was fervour; he could not restrain it. Vritra is the belly; hunger is man's enemy; he who knows this, slays the enemy hunger.
Keith, Arthur Berriedale, tr: The Veda of the Black Yajus School: Entitled Taittiriya Sanhita. Vols. 1 and 2. Cambridge MA: The Harvard University Press, 1914.
ii. 4. 12.
Tvastr, his son slain, offered Soma excluding Indra. Indra desired an invitation to the rite, but he did not invite him, (saying), Thou hast slain my son. He made a disturbance of the sacrifice, and forcibly drank the Soma. The remains of it Tvastr cast upon the Ahavaniya (fire), saying, Hail! wax great, Indra s foe. While (the fire) was flaming upwards to strike, just then of itself it stayed; whether so much was before [1], or so much was over the fire, be sprang up alive and came into union with Agni and Soma. He grew on all sides an arrow(shot), he enveloped these worlds. Because he enveloped these worlds, therefore is Vrtra, Vrtra. Indra feared him, and Tvastr too; Tvastr dipped his bolt for him; the bolt was fervour; he could not restrain it. Visnu [2] was another god; he said, Visnu, come hither; we will grasp that by which he is this world. Visnu deposited himself in three places, a third on the earth, a third in the atmosphere, a third in the sky, for he was afraid of his growth. By means of the third on earth Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, Hurl it not at me; there is this [3] strength in me; I will give it to you. He gave it to him, he accepted it, and (saying), Thou didst further me gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), Let Indra place power (indriya) in us. By means of the third in the atmosphere Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, Hurl it not at me; there is this [4] strength in me; I will give it to you. He gav it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), Twice hast thou furthered me gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), Let Indra place power in us. By means of the third in the sky Indra raised his bolt, aided by Visnu. He said, Hurl it not at me; I will give to thee that by which I [5] am this world! He said, Yes. (He replied), Let us make a compact; let me enter thee. If thou dost enter me, in what way wilt thou enjoy me? I will kindle thee; I will enter thee for thine enjoyment he answered. Vrtra entered him. Vrtra is the belly; hunger is man s enemy; he who [6] knows this slays the enemy hunger. He gave it to him; he accepted it, and (saying), Thrice hast thou furthered me gave it to Visnu. Visnu accepted it (saying), Let Indra place power in us. In that thrice he gave and thrice he accepted, that is the reason of the threefold character of the threefold. In that Visnu aided him and he gave (it) to Visnu, therefore the offering belongs to Indra and Visnu. Whatever there is here he gave to him, the Rcas, the Samans, the Yajuses. A thousand he gave to him; therefore there are a thousand gifts.

On “Indrasatrur varddhasva” as faulty utterance, Patañjali's Mahābhāshya pradIpa for paspaśāhnika says it is "indrashatrurvardhasva". The tippaNI says its in Śatapatha 1/6/3.
The following is the relevant portion from pradIpa:
"tatra indrasya shamayitA shAtayitA vA bhava - iti kriyAshabdo atra shatrushabda AshritaH, tadAshrayaNe hi bahuvrIhitatpuruShayoH arthabhedaH. tatra indra-amitratve siddhe sati 'indrasya shatrurbhava' ityatrArthe pratipAdye antodAtte prayoktavye, AdyudAttaH R^itvijA prayuktaH iti - arthAntarAbhi dhAnAt indra eva vR^itrasya shAtayitA saMpannaH."
... indra-shatrur vardhasva (Note indra-shatru in prathamA and vardhasva as in "grow")
The pradIpa says:
In this matter, 'become the quencher or slayer of indra', that is the verb basis of this 'shatru'word, and it is for that reason that the bahuvrIhi and tatpurushha compounds have different meanings. Given that the enmity to indra is beyond doubt, while wanting to signify that '(grow to) become the slayer of indra', where an udAtta final accent should have been used; the priest used an initial udAtta accent. So - because it carried the other meaning, it was indra that came to be the slayer of vR^itra.
indrḥ इन्द्रः [इ् न्द -रन्; इन्दतीशत इन्द्रः ; इशद ऐर्श्ये Malli.] 1 The lord of gods. -िुत्रः 1 an enemy or
destroyer of Indra (when the accent is on the last syllable), an epithet of प्रह्लाद ; इन्द्रित्रो शववधणस्व मा शिरां जशह शवशद्वषम् Bhāg.6.9.12. र्शलप्र शदष्टाां शश्रयमाददानां ैत्रशवक्रमां पादशमवेन्द्रिुत्रः
R.7.35. -2 [इन्द्रः िुत्रः यस् ] one whose enemy is Indra, an epithet of वृत्र (when the accent is on the first syllable). (This refers to a legend in the Śat. Br., where it is said that Vṛitra's father intended his son to become the destroyer of Indra, and asked him to say इन्द्रिुत्रवणधस्व &c. but who, through mistake, accented the word on the first syllable, and was killed by Indra; cf. Śikṣā.52; मिो हीनः स्वरतो वणणतो वा शमथ्ाप्रयुक्तो न तमथणमाह । स वाग्वज्रो यजमानां शहनक्तस्त यथेन्द्रिुत्रः स्वरतो $पराधात् ॥ (Apte, p. 386)
इन्द्र --िुत्र [p= 167,1] mfn. (/इन्द्र °) one whose enemy or conqueror is इन्द्र , conquered
by इन्द्र RV. i , 32 , 6 TS. S3Br.; m. " इन्द्र 's enemy (in this sense the accent is इन्द्र
ि्त्र /उ cf. Introd. p. xviii)" , N. of प्रह्लाद Ragh. vii , 32 BhP. vi , 9 , 11 (with both the meanings) (Monier-Williams).
Tvashta was performing a sacrifice to produce a person (or device) capable of killing Indra (in revenge of Indra killing his son). Accordingly 'indrashatruH vardhasva' is a sacrificial pronouncement. The sacrifice was creating indrashatru (device) or indrashatruH (this is more correct since the outcome was vrittra). So Tvashta is just pronouncing 'tvaM vardhasva' or the equivalent 'indrashatruH vardhasva' ='(tvaM) indrashatruH vardhasva' .(also 'v^Ridh' is used only in Atmanepada but with exception can be used as Parasmaipada in the madhyama future, aorist, conditional and desiderative.)

1:6:3:1 1. Tvashtri had a three-headed, six-eyed son. He had three mouths; and because he was thus shaped, his name was Visvarûpa ('All-shape').



154
1:6:3:2 2. One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other kinds of food. Indra hated him and cut off those heads of his. 1:6:3:3 3. Now from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock (francoline partridge) sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown. 1:6:3:4 4. From the one which was spirit-drinking, further, a sparrow sprang; whence the latter talks as if stammering, for he who has drunk spirits, talks as if he stammered. 1:6:3:5 5. Then from the one which served for other kinds of food, a partridge sprang; whence the latter is much variegated in colour: on its wings, namely, butter-drops, as it were, have dropped in one place and honey- (or mead-) drops in another, for suchlike, as it were, was the food which he consumed with that (mouth). 1:6:3:6 6. Tvashtri was furious: 'Has he indeed slain my son?' he exclaimed. He brought Soma-juice from which Indra was excluded; and just as the Soma-juice on being produced had Indra excluded from it (apendra), so it remained (when it was offered up). 1:6:3:7 7. Indra thought with himself, 'They are now excluding me from Soma!' and though uninvited, he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, even as the stronger (consumes) that of a weaker. That (Soma) however, injured him; it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; from his mouth alone it did not flow, but from all the other (openings of the) vital airs it flowed; hence (was instituted) at that time the ishti, called Sautrâmanî: on the occasion of that (ceremony) it is explained how the gods healed him 1. 1:6:3:8 8. Tvashtri was furious, and exclaimed, 'Has he indeed consumed my Soma uninvited?' However, he himself desecrated the sacrifice, for what pure (Soma) there was left in the tub he let flow (into the fire), saying, 'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe 2!' The moment it reached the fire, it developed (into human shape), or, as some say, it so developed whilst on its way (to the fire). It became possessed of 1 Agni and Soma, of all sciences, all glory, all nourishment, all prosperity. 1:6:3:9 9. And since it so developed whilst rolling onwards (vrit), it became Vritra; and since he sprang forth footless, therefore he was a serpent. Danu and Danâyû received him like mother and father 2, whence they call him Dânava. 1:6:3:10 10. And because he (Tvashtri) said, 'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe!' therefore Indra slew him (Vritra). Had he said, 'Grow thou, the foe (slayer) of Indra!' he (Vritra) would certainly have forthwith slain Indra.
1:6:3:11 11. And because he (Tvashtri) said, 'Grow thou!' therefore he (Vritra) grew an arrow's range sideways and an arrow's range forward: he forced back both the western ocean and the eastern one; and in proportion as he extended did he devour the food. 1:6:3:12 12. In the fore-noon the gods offered him food, at mid-day the men, and in the afternoon the Fathers. 1:6:3:1313. Now while Indra was thus moving on (in pursuit of Vritra), he addressed Agni and Soma, 'Ye belong to me and I belong to you! That one is nothing to you: why then do ye support that Dasyu against me? Come over to me!' 1:6:3:14 14. They replied, 'What is to be our reward in that case?' He offered them that AgniSoma cake on eleven potsherds: this is the reason why there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma. 1:6:3:15 15. They went over to him, and after them went forth 1 all the gods, all the sciences, all glory, all nourishment, all prosperity: thus by offering that (cake to Agni and Soma) Indra became what Indra now is. Such then is the significance of the full-moon offering; and he who, knowing this, performs the full-moon offering in this wise, attains to the same state of prosperity, becomes thus endowed with glory, becomes such a consumer of food (as Vritra). 1:6:3:16 16. Now Vritra, on being struck, lay contracted like a leather bottle drained of its contents, like a skin bag with the barley-meal shaken out. Indra rushed at him, meaning to slay him.



155
1:6:3:17 17. He said, 'Do not hurl (thy thunderbolt) at me! thou art now what I (was before) Only cut me in twain; but do not let me be annihilated!' He (Indra) said, 'Thou shalt be my food!' He replied, 'So be it!' He accordingly cut him in twain; and from that (part) of his which was of the Soma nature 2, he made the moon, and that which was demoniacal (asurya) he made enter these creatures as their belly; hence people say 3: 'Vritra was then a consumer of food, and Vritra is so now.' For even now, whenever that one (the moon) waxes fuller, it fills itself out of this world 4; and whenever these creatures crave for food, they pay tribute to this Vritra, the belly. Whosoever knows that Vritra as a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.

About Germanic tribes, Tacitus (56-120 CE), senator and historian of Roman Empire, wrote in Germania (in De origine et situ Germanorum):
The Germans themselves I should regard as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times, it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive; and the boundless and, so to speak, hostile ocean beyond us, is seldom entered by a sail from our world. And, beside the perils of rough and unknown seas, who would leave Asia, or Africa, or Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past, they celebrate an earth-born god, Tuisco, and his son Mannus, as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called Ingævones; those of the interior, Herminones; all the rest, Istævones. (Complete Works of Tacitus. Tacitus. Alfred John Church. William Jackson Brodribb. Lisa Cerrato. edited for Perseus. New York. : Random House, Inc. Random House, Inc. reprinted 1942, p.2). http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text
"In ancient days, their only type of historical tradition, they celebrate Tuisto, a god brought forth from the earth. They attribute to him a son, Mannus, the source and founder of their people, and to Mannus three sons, from whose names those nearest the Ocean are called Ingvaeones, those in the middle Herminones, and the rest Istvaeones. Some people, inasmuch as antiquity gives free rein to speculation, maintain that there were more sons born from the god and hence more tribal designations—Marsi, Gambrivii, Suebi, and Vandilii—and that those names are genuine and ancient." (Germania, chapter 2;Tales of the Barbarians: Ethnography and Empire in the Roman West, p. 40, Greg Woolf, John Wiley & Sons; loc. cit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannus). Tuesday (n.) third day of the week, Old English tiwesdæg, from Tiwes, genitive of Tiw "Tiu," from Proto-Germanic *Tiwaz "god of the sky," the original supreme deity of ancient Germanic mythology, differentiated specifically as Tiu, ancient Germanic god of war, from PIE *deiwos "god," from root *dyeu- "to shine" (see diurnal). Compare Old Frisian tiesdei, Old Norse tysdagr, Swedish tisdag, Old High German ziestag. http://etymonline.com/index.php It is significant that, according to Tacitus, the Germanic peoples celebrate the earth-born god, Tuisco (variant Tuisto), a name derived from Rigveda, Tvaṣṭā, Tvaṣṭṛ, the divine artificer, born of Viśvakarma, the divine architect, artisan.

Visvakarman. 81 1. HE who sate down as Hotarpriest-, the Rsi, our Father, offering up all things existing, He, seeking through his wish a great possession, came among men on earth as archetypal. 2 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that supported him? How was it? Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with mighty power disclosed the heavens. 3 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on all sides, arms and feet on all sides, He, the Sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them, with his arms as wings, together. 4 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven? Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things. 5 Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy midmost- here, O Visvakarman, Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thyself, exalted, to our worship. 6 Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and Heaven to worship. Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron. 7 Let us invoke today-, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the thoughtswift- Visvakarman. May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid, whose works are righteous. Visvakarman. 82 1. THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness. Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the earth were far extended. 2 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence. Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven Rsis. 3 Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races and all things existing, Even he alone, the Deities' narnegiverhim-, other beings seek for information. 4 To



161
him in sacrifice they offered treasures, Rsis of old, in numerous troops, as singers, Who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all these things that have existence. 5 That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the Asuras and Gods had being, What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Gods were seen together? 6 The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together. It rested set upon the Unborns' navel, that One wherein abide all things existing. 7 Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another thing hath risen up among you.

“Visvakarma, the Lord of the arts, master of a thousand handicrafts,
carpenter of the gods and builder of their palaces divine, fashioner
of every jewel, first of craftsmen, by whose art men live, and whom,



166
a great and deathless god, they continually worship.”
– Mahabharata
Rig Veda, tenth Mandalasuktas 81 and 82[i] RV carries two suktas in the name of
Vishvakarma so also of Indra, Agni and Maruts. The citation goes as Rishi Vishvakarma
Bhauvana, the Creator Vishvakarma, the maker of all that exist in the world manifested, who
executes the process of creation on the earth and heaven as a Designer. Vishvakarma
in sukta 82 is addressed as the father of vision, wise in spirit, originator of the two worlds,
rich in light, having the comprehensive mind. He is the Disposer, Ordained and the highest
Seer. He knows all the worlds and domains and He alone assigns the names to the Gods.

Portrayal of Vishvakarma in Vedas
Lord Sri Vishvakarma is the origin of all sculptures, the creator of the varied architecture of
this universe and the source of all forms, names and actions. He existed even before creation
and is the cause of not only the cycle of creation, sustenance and destruction but even the
condemnation and grace later on.Hekeeps Mother Gayatriin his heart and has provided refuge
at His feet for Saraswati, the Goddess of Knowledge. Preoccupied with the dharma of their
duties, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and other Gods rely on Him for their powers and are His
instruments.
He is beyond description (nirguna) and formless (niraakaara). He is as high as the Meru
Mountain and is seated on an effulgent seat. He is adorned with bracelet, armlet, gem-studded
garlands, a crown decked with divine gems, earrings and yellow clothing. He shines like
lightning and dazzles all the eyes that try to see Him. He is also known as Prajapati and
Hiranyagarbha. The clouds are his vehicle.
Through a yajna he created the universe and is the first yajnakartru.He is like the
divine kalpavriksha and fulfils the desires of devotees who surrender unto Him.He is
everlasting and is the ultimate truth.He is called the Lord of speech by Vedarshis. He is the
ocean of origin for all the vedaagamas. He is said to be equally versatile in jnana and karma
yogas and can be considered to be the tattvic origin of all divine forms.He is the priest who
makes offerings to the sacrificial fire, the father who created everything and the one who



167
protects and nurtures everything. He is the cause for all the worlds to be glowing with
prosperity and the one in whom all the worlds converge just the way all the spokes of a
chariot wheel converge at the centre. The closing of His eyelids signify the end of the world
and His auspicious glance is the cause of creation.
The SvayambhuVishvakarma is honoured not only for creation of the universe but also for
having initiated sacrifice and then given the example by sacrificing himself. In later times
when he assumes the form of Tvastra Brahma, and in this new position of hierarchy his role
is relegated to an architect of the gods. He built the heavens and palaces to gods, such as
Indra’s Vyjayanta, Kubera’s and then Ravana’s Lanka, Pandavas palace at Indraprastha. As
Tvashtri, he created many of the chariots, including that of Pushpaka of Kubera. He takes
pride in preparing suitable and appropriate weapons to gods that included the thunderbolt of
Indra, the lance of Kartikeya, the trident of Siva and the discus of Vishnu. It is believed that
when the part of Surya’s substance fell blazing, Vishvakarma put on the lathe and created the
strongest weapon synonyms to the power of these gods. Varahamihira, in Brhat Samhita,
while introducing a chapter on architecture mentions about the thee architects namely,
Visvakarma, Maya and Kama, who have given the architectural vision of dwelling places for
gods, kings, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Shudras. The temple is built in the likeness of
universe and is reduced image. The architect of this world image, the temple, is looked upon
as descended from, and in his sphere alike to,
Further, Stella Kramrisch adds, that ‘with regard to the making of universe, Visvakarma is
the working, Brahma the thinking aspect of the Supreme Principle’. Varahamihira in the
chapter on the Glory of Indra’s Banner, describes the jewels offered by the Gods to decorate
the Indra Dhvaja. Amongst all the gods, the first to offer an ornament red like the Asoka
flowers and of quadrangular form was Visvakarma, the celestial architect and followed by
Siva, Indra, Yama, Varuna, Vayu, Skanda, Agni, Surya, Tvasta, Visve-Devas, Guru, Shukra
and other sages. These ornaments are taken as the celestials are presided before the Indra
Dhvaja. This establishes the supreme place of Visvakarma in the order and cadre of the
deities worshipped in any of the auspicious occasions or temple festivals.

There are quite a number of historical inscriptions in the temples, where the mentioning of
the historical architect in comparison with the celestial architect Visvakarma. One such



168
inscription found on the mantapa of the Purana Mahadeo Temple, Sikar Rajputana states,
“The architect (Sutradhara) of this temple of Siva (Sankarabhavana) was Candasiva, the
famed son of Virabhadra, omniscient like Visvakarman in the science of architecture” The
Visvakarma tradition in temple building is of greater significance and many of the texts have
been compiled and working manuals were created from time to time by the master artisans on
the basis of the science and art of architecture and iconography of the Visvakarma lineage.
The icon of Visvakarma Panchami Brahma has the five faces representing Sadyojaata,
Vaamadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusha, Eeshaana aspects and ten hands holding on right side
trishula, chakra, bana, sarpa and akshamala, while on left side holding dhamaru, sankha,
dhanus, vina and kumuda pushpa, signifying the attributes of the trimurti namely, Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesha.

1. Lord Sri Vishvakarma, who is the origin of all sculptures, the creator of the varied architecture of this universe, the source of all forms, names and actions, has provided refuge at His feet for Saraswati, the Goddess of Knowledge and is called the Lord of speech by Vedarshis. He is the ocean of origin for all the vedaagamas, shines like lightning and is dazzling all the eyes that try to see Him. He, who is nurturing all creatures by keeping Mother Gayatri, protective armour of the whole of creation, in his heart, who is as high as the Meru Mountain, is seated on an effulgent seat and fulfils the desires of devotees who surrender unto Him, like the divine kalpavriksh
2. I salute the Lord of the world, Sri Vishvakarma, who is the cause of not only the cycle of creation, sustenance and destruction but even the condemnation and grace later on, who is adorned with bracelet, armlet, stone-studded garlands, a crown decked with divine gems,



169
earrings, yellow cloth and having the clouds as vehicle and who fulfils the wishes of His devotees.
4. I bow to Lord Vishvakarma who is the priest who makes offerings to the sacrificial fire, the father who created everything, the one who protects and nurtures everything, the cause for all the worlds to be glowing with prosperity and the one in whom all the worlds converge just the way all the spokes of a chariot wheel converge at the centre. 5. I prostrate to Lord Vishvakarma, the closing of whose eyelids signify the end of the world and whose auspicious glance is the cause of creation. 6. I bow to Lord Vishvakarma in whom, preoccupied with the dharma of their duties, Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and other Gods rely on for their powers and whose instruments they are.
Pancha Brahmas
Vishvakarma has the form of Shuddha (pure) Brahma and is effulgent with five faces. These five faces are called Sadyojaata, Vaamadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusha, Eeshaana. The five Vedas originate from these five faces. The five Brahmas namely Saanaga, Sanaatana, Ahabhoovana, Pratna and Suparna were born from these five faces.
श्री पञ्चास् शवराशजतम् तदुदय तत्पञ्च वेद प्रभुम्

1. I constantly prostrate to the Shuddha (pure) Brahma, the form of Vishvakarma, who is
effulgent with five faces, who is the reason for the five Vedas originating from these five
faces, who effected the birth of the five Brahmas namely Saanaga, Sanaatana, Ahabhoovana,
Pratna, Suparna, who existed even before creation and is the reason for creation, sustenance,



170
destruction and the condemnation and grace later on, is everlasting and is the ultimate truth,
for the fulfilment of all my desires.

Conclusion:
Vishvakarma, the Celestial architect is not just a mythical persona but the legendary figure of a living tradition of Indian art and architecture. The traditional craftsmen and artists were come to be designated as the Vishvakarma Brahmins in course of time and they considered themselves as analogy of the divine architect Vishvakarma. The Rigveda, Mandala ten two sets of suktas are chants describing the creative power of Vishvakarma. The ancient text Vishvakarmiyam is believed to be the direct form of science and art of vastushilpa rendered by Vishvakarma. In some of the regions the vishvakarma tradition of iconography and



175
iconometry are followed even today and the traditional sculptors of Karnataka are the true representatives of the cultural heritage of vishvakarma .

Invocation to Tvaṣṭ ̥r.
RV 1.113.10 I invoke the chief and multiform Tvas.t.r. (= Vis'vakarma_); may he be solely ours. Sayana explains: Tvas.t.a_ = Vis'vakarma_, artificer of the gods, the fabricator of the original sacrificial vase or ladle. tvas.t.a_ vai pas'u_na_m mithuna_na_m ru_kakr.t---iti s'ruteh (Taittiri_ya.Sam.hita_ 6.1.8.5): Tvas.t.a_ forms in animals in pairs. This remarkable elucidation seems to anticipate the characteristic hieroglyphic multiplex forms -- particularly antithetical, pairs -- of composite animals used repeatedly in Indus Script Corpora. This



181
characteristic pairing seems to be reflected in the explanation for the cognate word Tuisto in Germania -- as derived from tvai 'two':
Tvastar, Tuisto, Ymir. According to Tacitus's Germania (98 CE), Tuisto is the divine ancestor of the Germanic peoples...Tuisto, is commonly connected to the Proto-Germanic root tvai ("two") and its derivative tvis ("twice"; "doubled")...Jacob argues that the Germanic Tuisto (assuming a connection with Tvastr) must originally have been the grandfather of Ymir (cognate to Yama). Incidentally, Indian mythology also places Manu (cognate to Germanic Mannus), the Vedic progenitor of mankind, as a son of Vivaswān, thus making him the brother of Yama/Ymir.(Jacob, Alexander (2005). Ātman: A Reconstruction of the Solar Cosmology of the Indo-Europeans. Georg Olms Verlag., p.232)...According to Rives (1999), the fact that the ancient Germanic peoples claimed descent from an earth-born god was used by Tacitus to support his contention that they were an indigenous population: the Latin word indigena was often used in the same sense as the Greek autochthonos, meaning literally '[born from] the earth itself' (from χθών – chthōn "earth").(Rives, J. B. (1999) (Trans.) Tacitus' Germania. Oxford University Press, pp. 111112.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuisto

Surya with consorts Saranyu (Sanjna) and Chhaya. Saranyu is the daughter of Tvastar
Saranya (Saraṇyū) or Saraniya (also known as Saranya, Sanjna, or Sangya) is the consort of Surya, and the divinity of clouds in Hindu tradition. She marries Vivasvat and is mother of Revanta, the twin Asvins, Manu, the twins Yama and Yami. Saraṇyū is the female form of the adjective saraṇyú, meaning "quick, fleet, nimble", used for rivers and wind in the Rigveda. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saranyu
RV 10.17.1-2:
Tvastar prepares the bridal of his Daughter: all the world hears the tidings and assembles.
But Yama's Mother, Spouse of great Vivasvat, vanished as she was carried to her dwelling.
From mortal men they hid the Immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasvat.
Saranyu brought to him the Asvin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children.

10.017.01 Tvas.t.a_ celebrates the marriage of his daughter; therefore, the whole world is assembled; but the mother of Yama, the newly-married wife of the mighty Vivasvat, disappeared. [Deity Saran.yu_: The legend: Saran.yu_, the daughter of Tvas.t.a_, was given in marriage to Vivasvat, and had by him Yama and Yami_. Intimidated by his ardour, she substituted another female, her shadow, Cha_ya_, for herself, and going to Uttarakuru, changed herself to a mare. Vivasvat begot Manu by Cha_ya_, when, finding his error, he set off to look for his wife. Discovering her disguise, he transformed himself to a horse, and had by his wife the two As'vins]. 10.017.02 The gods concealing the immortal (Sarn.yu_) for th esake of mortals and having formed her, gave her to Vivasvat. She bore the two As'vins when this had happened and then Saran.yu_ gave birth to two twins. [For the sake of mortals: maryebhyah = manus.yebhyas tadutpattyartham, for men, i.e. that men might be born. Manu was the offspring of Vivasvat and the woman resembling Saran.yu_ and all men are descended from Manu; the two twins: Yama and Yami_, but dva_ mithuna_, may mean two pairs of twins, Yama and Yami_, the first pair and the As'vins the second]. 10.017.03 May the discriminating Pu_s.an, whose cattle are never lost, the protector of all beings, transfer you hence (to a better world); may he give you to these Pitr.s; may Agni (give) you to the beneficent gods. [This and the following three r.cas are to be recited at the funeral rites of a man who has been duly initiated, di_ks.ita]. 10.017.04 May the all-pervading Va_yu protect you, may Pu_s.an (preserve) you, (going) first on the excellent path (to heaven); may the divine Savita_ place you, where the virtuous abide, whither they have gone. [a_yu = Va_yu]. 10.017.05 Pu_s.an knows all these regions severally; met him conduct us by (the path) that is most free from peril; let him precede us, who is the giver of prosperity, endowed with radiance, accompanied by all pious men, ever vigilant, and knowing our (deserts). 10.017.06 Pu_s.an has been born on the best path of paths, on the best path of heaven on the best path of earth, he goes forward and backward over both (worlds), the assemblies longed for by all, discriminating (the merits of the dead). [Pu_s.an has been born: i.e., manifested in order to conduct men after death to their destination, according to their merits; he goes forward: i.e., favourably to the virtuous to show the fruit of good owrks, backward, i.e., he walks adversely to the wicked; discriminating the merits: i.e., he walks adversely to the wicked]. 10.017.07 The devout invoke Sarasvati_; they worship Sarasvati_ at the strewn sacrifice; the virtuous call upon Sarasvati_; may Sarasvati_ bestow blessings upon the donor (of the oblation). 10.017.08 Divine Sarasvati_, who rides in the same chariot with the Pitr.s, and delighted (along with them) by the (sacrificial) viands, seated on the sacred grass gratified (by our offering, and grant us wholesome food. 10.017.09 Sarasvati_, whom the Pitr.s invoke when circumambulating sacrifice on the right, bestow upon the worshippers at this sacrifice a portion of food fit for thousands, and increase of riches. 10.017.10 May the maternal waters, purify us; may the shedders of water purify us with the effusion; for the divine (waters) bear away all sin; I come away from them purified (to heaven). [Shedders of water...with effusion: ghr.tena no ghr.tapvah punantu: waters which purify others by water; ghr.ta = effused water; ghr.tapvah = divinities presiding over effused water; or, ghr.ta = oiled butter (Yajus. 4.2); udemi = I go to heaven (S'atapatha Bra_hman.a 3.1.2.11)]. 10.017.11 The Soma has risen to the earthly and heavenly (worlds), both this visible world, and that which (existed) before (it); I offer that Soma flowing through the common region (of heaven and earth) after the sacrifice (offered by the) seven (officiating priests). [drapsam = a name of the Sun (S'atapatha Bra_hman.a: 8.4.1.20); hotra_h = ditah, which are seven: zenith, nadir, centre and four cardinal points]. 10.017.12 Soma, which escapes (from the hide), your filaments which let fall from the hands (of the priest escape) from the vicinity of the planks

Meyer considers Tuisto and Tvaṣṭṛ of Rigveda to be identical. [Meyer (1907) sees the connection as so strong, that he considers the two to be identical.( Meyer (1907): referenced in : North, Richard (1997). Heathen Gods in Old English Literature. Cambridge University Press.(p.269)] Tuisto is described as being "celebrated" (celebrant) by the early Germanic peoples in song, with Tacitus reporting nothing negative about Tuisto. (Lindow, John. (2001) Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs, p. 296).
Tacitus' reference to Mannus as the son of Tuisto is instructive and jibes with the Indian
tradition of Manu as a form of Tvasta together with Maya, Silpi and Visvajna. Vishvakarma [
God ] created five prajapathies — from his five faces such as Sadyojāta,Vāmadeva,
Aghora,Tatpuruṣha,Īsāna.[11] They are Manu, Maya, Tvasta, Silpi, Visvajna. These
memories among the people is so strong that the narrative of Tacitus about Tuisto may indeed
be a recollected memory of Tvaṣṭṛ and also Visvakarma of Rigveda It is no mere accident
that both Tvaṣṭṛ and Visvakarma of Rigveda are related as the divinities venerated by
artisans, artificers, smiths who make vajra, the thunderbolt and other weapons and metal
implements. These narratives are evidence validating Indus Script Corpora as catalogus
catalogorumof metalwork, together with archaeometallurgical evidences, say, recovered from
Chanhu-daro. These narratives together with the evidence of Gundestrup Cauldron with Indus
Script hieroglyphs may be evidence of migrations of Bharatam Janam into Europe
establishing contacts with Germanic peoples described in Tacitus'Germania. The links of
Mleccha (Meluhha) with Germanic people of Germania date to ca. 3rd millennium

cire_17.html Tuisto was Tvaṣṭṛ of Rigveda who produced the metal weapon: vajra, the
thunderbolt. The divinity Tvaṣṭṛ is mentioned in the Mitanni treaty, which establishes him as
a Proto-Indo-Iranian divinity. Tvaṣṭr is Śukrācārya's son, Śukrācārya (the weapons' mentor of
the asura) is Bhṛgu's grandson and Vāruṇibhṛgu's son. Tvaṣṭr is the father of
ViŚvarupa. See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/06/tvasta-metal-artificer-was

born creator of the universe. Also included is RV 10.82 which venerates Visvakarman
n associations with V ̥rtra and Dadhici, episodes later elaborated in Bhagavata Purana.
See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2015/06/tvastr-is-metaphor-for-veneration
of.html Tvaṣṭ ̥r is a metaphor for veneration of metalwork artificers, Bhāratam Janam, in
Rigveda. RV 1.80.16 refers to Dadhyanc, son of Atharvan; RV 1.80.1 refers to Indra wielding
the metal vajra thunderbolt weapon against VRtra. RV 1.85.9 refers to Indra slaying VRtra
using the vajra made by TvaSTA and releasing the water of oceans. RV 1.32.1, RV 1.32.5 to

10.65.10, RV 10.66.8 also refers to Indra's battle against VRtra and as the slayer of VRtra.
The gloss vRTrhA of RV 2.1.11 is also explained by Sayana as 'destroyer of sin'. These references reinforce the role of Tvaṣṭā as a metal artificer who made metallic weapons. This gets elaborated in a narrative in the Bhagavata Purana related to a son of Tvaṣṭā called Vis'varupa who was killed in battle. There is a remarkable episode of mispronunciation by Tvaṣṭā, making him a mleccha. This mispronunciation with a wrong accent on the phrase: Indra-śatro resulted in the birth of V ̥rtra who, instead of becoming a slayer of Indra, gets killed in battle by Indra.
"The sagas, which are the sole record of their past history, say that the God Tuisto (Or
Tuisco, the deity that gives its name to Tuesday)sprang from the earth, and that he and his
son Mannus were the authors and founders of the race. To Mannus they ascribe three sons,
whose names are borne respectively by the Ingaevones ["Grimm's identification of the
Ingaevones with the Saxons, of the Iscaevones with the Franks, and of the Herminones with
the Thuringians is convenient " (Stubbs, Const. Hist., i. 38]next to the ocean, the Herminones
in the middle of the countiy, and the Iscaevones in the rest of it. Others, with true
mythological license, give the deity several more sons, from whom are derived more tribal
names, such as Marsians, Gambrivians, Suabians, and Vandals ; and these names are both
genuine and ancient. The name Germany, however, is new and of recent application, owing
to the fact that the first of these peoples to cross the Rhine and dispossess the Gauls, a tribe
now known as the Tungrians, then got the name of "Germans". Thus what was originally a
name given to a tribe and not that of a race gradually came to be accepted, so that all men of
the race were called Germans, by the victorious tribe first as a name of fear, and by
themselves afterwards when the name had once been coined. "(The Agricola and Germania

http://vedabase.net/sb/6/9/11/en2 http://prabhupadabooks.com/pdf/SB6.2.pdf "While the gods Indra and Agni stood for Power and Wisdom, the gods PUSan and Bhaga, Rbhus, TvaSTA and Vis'vakarman presided over the economic activities of the people. The technical and the ritual aspects of productive activity were closely united just as the forms of wealth were conceived in close connection with the favour of the gods...All rUpas are of TvaSTA (the divine fashioner). TvaSTA inherited them from Agni or, as Aitareya has it, TvaSTA is nothing but speech. In other words, all forms are originally contained in divine wisdom, the ultimate illuminer. It is from there that the artificing and fashioning mind derives them. Reality is conceived as a luminous powere which creates things or forms out of itself. The human mind is capable of responding to the Light and apperceiving the forms in which it expresses itself. The forms which man perceives, thus, are not phantasms produced by the senses or the mind but created things rooted in reality."(Pande, GC, 1990, Foundations of Indian culture: spiritual vision and symbolic forms, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, p.61, p.344) "According to the Bhagavat Purana, he chanted: “Indra-satro vivardhasva ma ciram jahi vidvisam” (“O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your enemy without delay”). (Bhagavat Purana 6.9.11). Tvasta intended to chant the word indra-satro, meaning, “O enemy of Indra.” Instead of chanting those words short, Tvasta chanted it long, and its meaning changed from “the enemy of Indra” to “Indra, who is an enemy.” Consequently, instead of a son who would kill the king of the gods, he had a son who would die at Indra’s hands. The smallest mistake in pronunciation led to his plans being foiled." -- Nimai Agarwalhttp://kidspiritonline.com/2014/12/the-power-of-words-in-my-tradition/ [quote]hata-putras tatas tvasta

After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed ritualistic ceremonies to kill Indra. He offered oblations in the sacrificial fire, saying, "O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your ene my without delay."
PURPORT
There was some defect in Tvasta's chanting of the mantra because he chanted it long instead of short, and therefore the meaning changed. Tvasta intended to chant the word indra-satro, m eaning, "O enemy of Indra." In this mantra, the word indra is in the possessive case (sasthi), a nd the word indra-satro is called a tat-purusa compound (tatpurusa-samasa) . Unfortunately, i nstead of chanting the mantra short, Tvasta chanted it long, and its meaning changed from "th e enemy of Indra" to "Indra, who is an enemy." Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra's, there emerged the body of Vrtrasura, of whom Indra was the enemy.
Bhag. 6.9.11
In the compound word indra-satro, the ending of the word satro is uttered short when it is in t he possessive case (sasthi) and long when it is in the vocative case (sambodhana) . Tvasta mis takenly uttered it long. He expected "Indra's killer" to be born from the sacrifice, but the mant ra he uttered meant "Indra is the killer of the person to be born."
In the above scenario, "long" and "short" do not denote dirgha and hrasva (see section 2.4.2 o n vowels), but long (udatta) and short (anudatta) pitch accents on vowels (also in 2.4.2). Tvas ta spoke Vedic Sanskrit (vaidika bhasa or vaidika samskrta), in which the word meaning can change depending on the pitch in which a vowel is accented. Vedic Sanskrit occurs only in th e sruti-sastra, the four Vedas, and it is also called srauta bhasa. The rest of Sanskrit literature i s written in classical Sanskrit (laukika bhasa or laukika samskrta), which is not altered by vo wel pitch accents.
The commentaries by Sridhara Svami and Varhsidhara on Bhagavatam 6.9.11 explain this inc ident in more detail. They say that the version of the mantra given in 6.9.11 is different from t he mantra used by Tvasta. The mantra given in the Vedas and described by Sridhara Svami a nd Vamsidhar was indra-satrur vardhasva, and their explanations of the mistake are based on this. It was customary to change a Vedic mantra a bit when mentioning sruti texts in writing b ecause the audience did not necessarily have qualifications (adhikara) in sruti. Hence the man tra from the Veda was changed in 6.9.11. Or it was changed owing to considerations of the ve rse meter. Hence we see that there is no actual vocative in the Vedic mantra. Sridhara Svami mentions that the mistake was in the svaras, vowel pitch accents. As far as the letters were co ncerned, they were accurately chanted. The mistake in the svaras (vowel pitch accents) was th at he chanted "indra" with the udatta accent, which changed it from what was intended (a tatp urusa meaning "Indra's enemy") to something else (a bahuvrihi) meaning Tndra is the killer of the person to be born."

https://archive.org/stream/Samskrtoccharanam.LS/samskrtoccharanam.%20LS_djvu.txt Vritra is also mentioned in the Rig Veda, where he is the demon of drought, who imprisons all the strom clouds and causes drought. Indra slays him with his thunder-bolt (Vajra) and frees the strom-clouds, bring bountiful rain to end the famine.
Slaying of Vritra
This story is taken from B.P. and Bhagavata Purana (Canto 6, Chapter 7-13). Brihaspati was
the Guru of the Devas. He was very learned and was first among the Brahmanas. Everyone
used to respect him. It so happened, that when he visited the court of Indra, the King of the
Gods was busy watching his beautiful Apsaras sing and dance, saw his Guru arrive.
However, in his arrogance, he did not rise from his throne, nor did he utter the customary
words of welcome and worship. The sage felt insulted. He resolved that he will no longer
grace the councils of the Devas, and went away to perform penance. Too late, Indra realized
his mistake. H searched high and low for his perceptor, but could not find him. Without their
Guru to guide them, the Devas could not survive for long. Besides, their traditional foes,
the Asuras, will seek to exploit this opportunity to and cash in on their weakened
state. Acting on the advice of Lord Brahma, the Devas installed Vishwarupa, the son of the
God Tvashta as their new Guru. He was also a Brahmana renowned for his learning and
yogic power. As time progressed, Vishwarupa started to notice that Indra and the Devas spent
an inordinate amount of time in pursuit of pleasure. Besides, his mother was aAsura woman,
and his loyalty was divided. Secretly, he started giving a portion of the sacrificial oblations
(Havis) to the Asuras. As a result, their strength increased. When Indra came to know of this
treachery, he became very angry. Without pausing to think the consequences of his actions,
he struck off the three heads of Vishwarupa. The first head, that was used for drinking Soma,
became a francolin partridge, the second head, used for drinking wine turned into a sparrow
and the third, used for eating, turned into a partridge. the head of his teacher with his sword.
Since he had killed a Brahmana, that too his Guru, he became guilty of the sin of Brahma
Hatya. However, he escaped his punishment by distributing the sin among the land, water,
and women. (Other accounts say that his lustre diminished and he had to regain it by doing
penance, during which time he was exiled from heaven.) In return for ridding Indra of the sin,
earth got water to fill its empty holes, trees got re-growth of cut branches, waters became
purifying, and women obtained undiminished sexual desire. As a result of their share of the
sin, earth has wastelands, trees have sap, waters have froth, and women have
menstruation. Now, Tvashta wanted revenge for the murder of his son. He began
arrangements for a sacrifice that would give him a son who could slay Indra. The sacrifice
was duly performed, but there was a small problem. When it was time for the final



192
incantations, Tvashta ought to have said, "May this son of mine be the slayer of Indra", but he
stressed the wrong syllables in the Mantra, and the meaning changed to "May Indra be the
slayer of this son of mine." From the sacrificial fire, there rose a terrible Asura. He was
named Vritra, 'the encloser'. He immediately grew immensely big and was as large as the
largest mountain. His hair was like molten copper, he had a mustache and beard of the same
color and had eyes blazing like the midday sun. He was armed with a magical trident. He
derived his immense strength from the incantations chanted at the sacrifice. His father then
ordered him to go and slayIndra. Obedient to the command, the demon began to seek the
slayer of his elder brother. Some time before this, the Asuras had been thoroughly defeated
by the Devas in battle. Peace reigned for a while. The Devas needed a place to store their
weapons safely, for they feared treachery. They then remembered that the Asuras dared not
approach the hermitage of the sage Dadhichi, such was the yogic power of the hermit. They
entrusted all their weapons to his safekeeping. When Dadhichi's wife Lopamudra came to
know about this, she was not pleased. She said to her husband, "An ascetic should not take
sides in a war. Now the Asuras will think that you are their enemy and seek to harm you.
Besides, the Gods have not mentioned how long you are to take care of their weapons. If
something were to happen to them in your custody, will they not blame you. We have
renounced all worldly possessions and attachments, you were wrong to have taken this
responsibility." Dadhichi saw the force of her arguments. He said, "What you say certainly
makes sense. However, I have given my word. It is important to stand by ones promise.
Besides, the Asuras were always the enemies of us sages, so the question of neutrality does
not arise. What is fated will happen, and no one prevent it." Years passed, and Dadhichi was
alarmed to note that the lustre of the divine weapons was beginning to diminish. Their power
was slowly dissolving in air. The sage then used his yogic power to dissolve all the weapons
in water and then he drank it all up. Their power was then lodged in his bones. Now,
with Vritra threatening at their doorsteps, the Devas wanted their weapons
back. Dadhichi said, "I have bad news for you. Your weapons are no longer there. Their
power now resides in my bones. I shall give up my life. You can then have new weapons
made from my bones." The Gods naturally balked at the thought of the Rishi's death.
However, no other choice was available, for they needed the weapons to
battle Vritra. Dadhichi gave up his life. Vishwakarma made Indra the weapon Vajra from the
back bone of the hermit. This weapon was the most powerful weapon of all. The armies of
the Devas and Asuras met in the battlefield. From the furious onslaught of the Asura army,
theDevas were initially driven back, but they redoubled their efforts and slowly gained the
upper hand. Seeing his forces retreating, Vritra was extremely angry. He charged ahead and



193
stopped the advance of the Devas single-handedly. He let out a mighty roar, which caused
many of the Devas to faint. Under his purposeful tread, the heavens began to shake. He
picked up his immense mace and struck Iyravata with it. Indra revived his mount with a touch
of Amrit. At this point, angry words were exchanged
between Vritra and Indra. The Asura taunted Indra for having slain his brother, a
defenseless Brahmana. Angered, Indra struck off one hand of Vritra with his sword. In
retaliation, theAsura made his mouth immensely huge and swallowed Indra whole. Though
he was swallowed by the Asura, Indra did not die, for he was protected by the grace
of Vishnu. He judged it to be time to use his Vajra. He used the great weapon and sliced open
the abdomen of the demon, and emerged victorious. However, having slain the creature
emerged from a holy sacrifice, he was once again weighed down with sin. Unlike before, he
could not get rid of it easily. He retired to the banks of Manasarovar and performed a penance
for thousand years to expiate his sins and to regain his
lustre. http://web.archive.org/web/20070105054802/http://members.cox.net/apamnapat/articl

Tacitus wrote:"In ancient lays, their only type of historical tradition, they celebrate Tuisto, a god brought forth from the earth. They attribute to him a son, Mannus, the source and founder of their people, and to Mannus three sons, from whose names those nearest the Ocean are called Ingvaeones, those in the middle Herminones, and the rest Istvaeones. Some people, inasmuch as antiquity gives free reign to speculation, maintain that there were more sons born from the god and hence more tribal designations- Marsi, Gambrivii, Suebi, and Vandilii- and that those names are genuine and ancient." (2.2) loc. cit. http://celto-germanic.blogspot.in/2014/04/tuisto-god-tiwaz.html
Richard North notes that tuisto may be 'two-standing' or 'standing twice'. Mannu is the son of Tuisto who is 'born from the earth'. (North, Richard, 1997, Heathen gods in old English literature, Cambridge University Press, pp.27, 270).

Griffith's translaion RV 10.90 Purusa. 90 1. A THOUSAND heads hath Purusa, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide. 2 This Purusa is all that yet hath been and all that is to be; The Lord of Immortality which waxes greater still by food. 3 So mighty is his greatness; yea, greater than this is Purusa. All creatures are onefourth- of him, threefourths- eternal life in heaven. 4 With threefourths- Purusa went up: onefourth- of him again was here. Thence he strode out to every side over what cats not and what cats. 5 From him Viraj was born; again Purusa from Viraj was born. As soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward over the earth. 6 When Gods prepared the sacrifice with Purusa as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood. 7 They balmed as victim on the grass Purusa born in earliest time. With him the Deities and all Sadhyas and Rsis sacrificed. 8 From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up. He formed the creatures ofthe- air, and animals both wild and tame. 9 From that great general sacrifice Rcas and Samahymns- were born: Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus had its birth from it. 10 From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born. 11 When they divided Purusa how



200
many portions did they make? What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet? 12 The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rajanya made. His thighs became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sudra was produced. 13 The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and Vayu from his breath. 14 Forth from his navel came midair- the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds. 15 Seven fencingsticks- had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared, When the Gods, offering sacrifice, bound, as their victim, Purusa. 16 Gods, sacrificing, sacrificed the victim these were the earliest holy ordinances. The Mighty Ones attained the height of heaven, there where the Sadhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.

What is this womb prajApati resides in ? 'bramhAnda roope garbhe anat madhye prajApatir vigrahavAn bhootva carati'. virAt, the shining universe, the female principle that puruSHa gave birth to, which in turn gave birth to puruSHa has now been formed into the bramhAnda, and is compared to a womb, in which prajApati, Lord of his Subjects, puruSHa manifested as a fertility diety invoked in weddings etc., resides. Purusha does not need to be born to manifest himself as all. That process begins before he appears from, in and as virAt. He encompasses satyam, gnyaanam, anantam - truth, knowledge, and infinity. Since he gives birth to all, he is yoni, themouth of the womb. His form is a yoni, from which all is born. 'tasya prajApater yonim jagatkAraNaroopam vAstavam svaroopam'. Who knows this ? 'dheera dhairyavantA yogena drtendriyA mahAtmAno jAnanti' - the brave, the courageous, those who have made their senses steadfast in yoga, those great ones know this truth. Such is the compulsion of this truth that even the srshtikartA-s of this world, those that puruSHa has manifested himself as in order to create, desire nothing but to worship him as 'tam eva upAsya mareeceenAm mareecyatri-pramukhAnAm' - the sage mareeci, and sages led by mareeci, atri (among the seven RSHis) - as these sages do.
Birthing this word Himself Unborn He is known by those Who yoked their senses.. And even the knowers Of this world and more Desire but to adore Him.

This is one answer to the question "kasmai devAya havitA vidhema?" - Which God shall we worship by our offerings ?
Who burns, fire-bright In the Gods, who is their priest, Eldest, who is the Essence, Of what Is, We worship Him.
Verse 5
rucam brAmham janayanta: | deva agre tadabruvan | yastvaivam brAhmaNo vidhyAt | tasya deva asan vashe || 5 || (deva) The Gods, who (janayanta) send forth the (rucam brAhmam) essence of the knowledge of Brahman (abruvan) said this (tat) about that Brahman (agre) in the Beginning : " (yastu) whoever (brAhmaNa:) has an inclination towards Brahman, if he (vidhyAt) knows Brahman (evam) thus, (devA:) the Gods (asan) will be (tasya) in his (vashe) control. " The Gods taste of Brahman.. This "rucam brAmham" is yet another food metaphor for the joining, or the union of the seeker and the sought. Even as he who eats food tastes it, so shall you taste Brahman, and enjoy him. The Gods are in the Brahma- Vidyaa-Sampradaaya, and they are our teachers, our gurus too. They declare this in the beginning, as a sort of 'phalashruti', or list of fruits of knowing the puruSHa thus : Who, with heart steadfast on the



202
puruSHa knows him thus, him even we will serve. Compare the Taittiriya Upanishad, that talks about he who knows Brahman - 'sarve asmai devA balim-Aharanti' - All the Gods bring him offerings.
The Gods who taste Him, and spread the word Said this, in the beginning ``Who with his heart Knows Him, thus, Him even We will be bound by.''
Verse 6
hreeshca te lakshmeeshca patnyau | ahorAtre pArshve | nakshatrANi roopam | ashvinau vyAttam |
iSHTam maniSHANa | amum maniSHANa | sarvam maniSHANA || (hreeshca) Hree and (lakshmishca) Laskhmi are (patnyau) wives (te) to you. (aho - rAtre) The day and the night (pArshve) your sides. (nakshatrANi) the Stars (roopam) your brilliant form. (ashvinau) the Healing Ashvins (vyAttam) your mouth (maniSHANa) Grant us (iSHTam) the knowledge that we desire, (maniSHANa) grant us (amum) happiness in this world, (maniSHANa) grant us (sarvam) all that is, now and forever Hree is the Goddess that grants Modesty, and Lakshmi she who grants Wealth. ( hreerlajjAbhimAninee devata , lakshmee- raishvayAbhimAninee devatA - iti sAyaNA) The Day and the Night are even such opposites. Sriman Narayana is the conciliation of all such opposites, even as Sesha, the snake, and garuda, the eagle, worshipping him together signify. He is brilliant as the stars, and healing comes from him. Asking him to grant as iSHTam, amum, sarvam, is an analogue to asking for sat, Ananda, and chit. All we ask is to know Him.
Hree and Lakshmi Are your consorts, your Two sides, Day and Night, The stars your form, Healing your words.Grant us Our desires, Our joys, Your all.
Concluding Invocation
The Purusha Sooktam closes, as it began, with that unique and wonderful invocation to peace. In peace all begins, and in peace all ends. All we work for is so peace may flourish.
[Note: The following is not part of the Purusha Sukta proper. However, it is often chanted at the end and is found in many printed editions.]

(AvrNeemahe) We seek (tat) that which (chamyo) gives us peace from sorrows, present and future. We seek (gAtum) growth (yagnyAya) for the rite of sacrifice and (gAtum) growth for (yagnyapataye) patron of the rite, the yajamAna. (daivee: svasti) The grace of the Gods (astu) be (na:) unto us. (svasti) Well being (mAnushebhya:) to all mankind. (bheshajam) May plants, like medicinal herbs (jigAtu) flourish and grow (oordhvam) upwards. (sham) Good (na: astu ) come unto us from (dvipade) creatures that go on two feet (sham) and good from (chatuSHpade) those that go on four feet. (shAnti:) Peace. Sorrows that are, and sorrows to be We seek that which grants us Peace from these May the rite flourish, And those who keep it..



203
The grace of the gods Be with all mankind.. May the earth be covered With growing green And good come to us From all creation From beings that go On two feet and four.. May the three-fold peace Embrace the Land.

The Yajur Vedins recite six more mantras dealing with the
Purusha found in TA (3.13) as a continuation of the Purusha Sukta.
Taittiriya recension of Krishna Yajur Veda
The Taittiriya Aranyaka TA (3.12) has 18 mantras on Purusha; it
has all the 16 mantras in RV. Moreover the order of the presentation
of the mantras in TA (3.12) is different from that in RV. The mantras
TA (3.12.16) and TA (3.12.17) are not in RV. TA (3.12.16) is also in
Shvetashvatara U.
Shukla Yajur Veda (madhyandina) Vajasaneya Samhita (VS)
VS has in all 40 adhyayas or chapters. The chapter 31, VS (31)
dealing with Purusha has 22 mantras.
The first 16 mantras of VS (31.1-16) are almost same as 16
mantras of RV, except for the ordering; there could be minor
variations in a small number of words. The major difference is in VS
(31.12). The first half is same as RV (10.90. 13), but the second half is
quite different namely shrotrat vayuh cha pranah cha mukhyat agnir
ajayata '.
VS (31) does not have the mantras TA (3.12.16) and TA (3.12.17)
mantras found in RV (10.90) and two more.
The remaining 6 mantras in VS(3l) namely (17-22) are same as
there in TA (3.13), the so-called Uttaranarayana anuvaka

Tvaṣṭṛ, ākhyāna or narration of itihāsa, history from the Bronze Age Rigveda, sacred text
Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/gpayut8 Tvaṣṭṛ, ākhyāna or narration of itihāsa, history from the Bronze Age Rigveda, sacred text This monograph demonstrates that the Rigveda venerated Tvaṣṭā, Tvaṣṭṛ as the divine ancestor of Meluhha artificers. The narratives of Proto-Indo-European People identified cognate Tuisto, Tuisco as the ancestor of Germanic people. The artificers of ancient times of the Bronze Age are held in high esteem – as creators of artha, wealth’ for the nation. The Rigveda narratives abound in complex metaphors and unravel the contributions made by artisans to the advancement of civilization on the banks of River Sarasvati and contact civilizational areas. A narrative of the cultural framework for the contributions is presented in the following Annexes: Annex 1 Etyma of Bharata sprachbund Tvaṣṭṛ ‘artificer’ Annex 2 RV 10.81, 82 Viśvakarmā See: Tvaṣṭā, Tvaṣṭṛ ancestor of Meluhha artificers = Tuisco, Tuisto, ancestor of Germanic people. Emerges from Viśvakarma (Purusha suktam) http://tinyurl.com/z4mttc5
The narrative of Tvastar is ākhyāna, itihāsa ‘cosmological narrative’ of Bhāratam Janam.



206
In civilizational or materialistic terms, Tvaṣṭṛ is the heavenly builder, the maker of divine implements such as Vajra of Indra and is the guardian of Soma. In my view, Tvaṣṭṛ (and hence, cognate identities such as Tuisto, Tuisco, Tarkhan, Dhiman) is a hero of Rigveda, the creator of artha, ‘wealth’ from Rigveda times. Let us listen to the ākhyāna (which is narration of itihāsa, history) in Rigveda, sacred text of the Hindus; the narratives bring us as close as possible to the ancient times, as we traverse back through mists of time. It is apposite to cite a quote from the Art Historian, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy: “Myth embodies the nearest approach to absolute truth that can be stated in words.” On ākhyāna
Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa ŚBr.13.4.3.12 and 13.4.3.13 explain how on the 8th and 9th days of aśvamedha, stories fromPurāṇa and Veda are narrated as itihāsa, ‘history’. The same practice of narration continues on 36 ten-day periods of yajña.

Tvastar is Hiranyagarbha
Tvaṣṭṛ is the first-born creator of the Universe. In Purusha sukta, according to Yajurveda, Tvaṣṭṛ emerges from
Viśvakarma: अु॒द्भ्यः सूः॑म्भतः पृशथु॒ैर्व्य रसाा॓च्च । शवु॒र्श् कः॑ मणणःु॒ समः॑वतणु॒ताशधः॑ । तु॒स् त्वष्टाः॑ शवु॒दधः॑द्र ू ु॒पमेः॑शत । त ः॑ ुत्परुष स् ु॒शवर्श् ु॒माजाः॑नु॒मेग्रा॓ Yajurveda merges the attributes of Visvakarma described in Rigveda (RV 10.81, 10.82 – See Annex 2) with the concepts of Hiranyagarbha, Prajapati, Brahma. Tvaṣṭar emerges out of the cosmic egg or from the navel of the unborn Viśvakarman, Tvaṣṭar is Hiranyagarbha or ‘golden womb’ Mentioned 65 times and invoked in Rigveda with reverence, Tvaṣṭṛ is the artificer who forms bodies of men and animals. He is garbha-pati, divinity of the womb. (Macdonell, Arthur Anthony (1995). "Abstract Gods". Vedic mythology. Vedas. Motilal Banarsidass Publ. pp. 116–118). Tvaṣṭṛ’s son is Viśvarūpa or Triśiras who is killed by Indra, and in revenge, Tvaṣṭṛ creates Vrtra. Tvaṣṭṛ’s daughter is Saranya (Saraṇyū) also known as Samjñā, who twice bears



207
twins to Surya (RV 10.17.1) – Twins of Yama and Yami and twins called Aśvins. Saranyu is also the mother of Manu (Yaska’s Nirukta calls him Savarni Manu, the progenitor of mankind). See annex for ākhyāna. A reflected, shadow image of Saranyu is छाया f. a reflected image , reflection v , 44 , 6 ; x , 121 , 2 ii , 8 v , 21 , 8 &c

RV 10.017 Tvastar prepares the bridal of his Daughter: all the world hears the tidings and assembles. But Yama's Mother, Spouse of great Vivasvat, vanished as she was carried to her dwelling. From mortal men they hid the Immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasvat. Saranyu brought to him the Asvin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children.

Tvaṣṭṛ is Indra's Father
RV 3.48 1. SOON as the young Bull sprang into existence he longed to taste the pressedout- Somas' liquor. Drink thou thy fill, according to thy longing, first, of the goodly mixture blent with Soma. 2. That day when thou wast born thou, fain to taste it, drankest the plants' milk which the mountains nourish. That milk thy Mother first, the Dame who bare thee, poured for thee in thy mighty Fathers' dwelling. 3. Desiring food he came unto his Mother, and on her breast beheld the pungent Soma. Wise, he moved on, keeping aloof the others, and wrought great exploits in his varied aspects. 4. Fierce, quickly conquering, of surpassing vigour, he framed his body even as he listed. even from his birthtime- Indra conquered Tvastar, bore off the Soma and in beakers drank it. 5. Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered; The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vrtras, wins and gathers riches. Indra conquers his father Tvaṣṭar and carries off Soma.
Tvaṣṭar is Trisiras or Vishwarupa's Father "Through his wise insight Trita in the cavern, seeking as ever the Chief Sire's intention, Carefully tended in his Parents' bosom, calling the weapons kin,



209
goes forth to combat." (RV 10.8.7) "Well-skilled to use the weapons of his Father, Āptya, urged on by Indra, fought the battle. Then Trita slew the foe seven-rayed, three-headed, and freed the cattle of the Son of Tvaṣṭar." (RV 10.8.8) "Lord of the brave, Indra cleft him in pieces who sought to gain much strength and deemed him mighty. He smote his three heads from his body, seizing the cattle of the omniform Son of Tvaṣṭar." (RV 10.8.9) Indra kills Son of Tvaṣṭar, Trisiras or Vishwarupa. Tvaṣṭar is the fashioner of Indra's Vajra weapon
"I WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, the Thunder-wielder. He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents." (RV 1.32.1) "He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of thunder Tvaṣṭar fashioned." (RV 1.32.2) Indra kills Vṛtra with his thunder bolt Vajra weapon fashioned by Tvaṣṭar.10 Rolled in the midst of neverceasing- currents flowing without a rest for ever onward.
The waters bear off Vrtra’s' nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to during darkness.
11 Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of Dasas, the waters stayed like kine held by the robber. But he, when he had smitten Vrtra, opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned. 12 A horses' tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second, Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers.
Tvaṣṭar is the companion of Angirases, he is the most wealthy "Since thou, God Tvaṣṭar, hast
made beauty perfect, since thou hast been the Aṅgirases' Companion, Willing, most wealthy, Giver of possessions, grant us the Gods’ assembly, thou who knowest."

"King Shaushtatar (ruled c. 1430) extended the boundaries of Mitanni through the conquest of Alalakh, Nuzi, Assur, and Kizzuwatna. Egypt, under Tuthmosis III (1479-1425 BCE), defeated the Mitanni at Aleppo after a long period of contention over control of the region of Syria. Later Egyptian dynasties entered into pacts and treaties with Mitanni and the daughter of the Mitanni King Tushratta, the princess Taduhepa, was given in marriage to Amenhotep III (1391-1353 BCE) as part of a treaty which balanced power between the two nations.This treaty was put to the test during a power struggle in Washukanni between Tushratta and a relative of the previous king, Shuttarna, known as Artatama II. Egypt backed Tushratta in this conflict while the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I backed Artatama II. Tushratta seemed poised to succeed when Egypt, fearing the growing power of the Hittites, withdrew its support. Suppiluliuma I, tired of diplomacy and now free to do as he pleased without fear of Egyptian reprisal, led his forces on Washukanni and sacked it. Tushratta was assassinated by his son, perhaps in an effort to save the city. Following this conquest, Mitanni was ruled by Hittite kings."http://www.ancient.eu/Mitanni/ The name Tushratta may also be a phonetic variant of Tvaṣṭ ̥r, Tuisto. Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni is postulated.
"In a treaty between the Hittites and the Mitanni (between Suppiluliuma and Shattiwaza, ca. 1380 BC), the deities Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya (Ashvins) are invoked.Kikkuli's horse training text (circa 1400 BC) includes technical terms such as aika (Vedic Sanskrit eka,

one), tera (tri, three), panza (pañca, five), satta (sapta, seven), na (nava,
nine), vartana (vartana, round). The numeral aika "one" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper (Vedic Sanskrit eka, with regular contraction of /ai/ to [eː]) as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has *aiva; compare Vedic eva "only") in general. Another text has babru(-nnu) (babhru,

Their chief festival was the celebration of the solstice (vishuva) which was common in most cultures in the ancient world. The Mitanni warriors were called marya (Hurrian: mariannu), the term for (young) warrior in Sanskrit as well;[1] note mišta-nnu (= miẓḍha,~ Sanskrit mīḍha) "payment (for catching a fugitive)" (Mayrhofer II 358). Sanskritic interpretations of Mitanni names render Artashumara (artaššumara) as Arta-smara "who thinks of Arta/Ṛta" (Mayrhofer II 780), Biridashva (biridašṷa, biriiašṷa) as Prītāśva "whose horse is dear" (Mayrhofer II 182), Priyamazda (priiamazda) as Priyamedha "whose wisdom is dear" (Mayrhofer II 189, II378), Citrarata as citraratha "whose chariot is shining" (Mayrhofer I 553), Indaruda/Endaruta as Indrota "helped by Indra" (Mayrhofer I 134), Shativaza (šattiṷaza) as Sātivāja "winning the race price" (Mayrhofer II 540, 696), Šubandhu as Subandhu 'having good relatives" (a name in Palestine, Mayrhofer II 209, 735), Tushratta (tṷišeratta, tušratta, etc.) as *tṷaišaratha, Vedic Tveṣaratha "whose chariot is vehement" (Mayrhofer I 686, I 736). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_superstrate_in_Mitanni

1. HE who sate down as Hotarpriest-, the Rsi, our Father, offering up all things existing, He, seeking through his wish a great possession, came among men on earth as archetypal. 2 What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that supported him? How was it? Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the earth, with mighty power disclosed the heavens. 3 He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on all sides, arms and feet on all sides, He, the Sole God, producing earth and heaven, weldeth them, with his arms as wings, together. 4 What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the earth and heaven? Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things. 5 Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy midmost- here, O Visvakarman, Teach thou thy friends at sacrifice, O Blessed, and come thyself, exalted, to our worship. 6 Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and Heaven to worship. Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron. 7 Let us invoke today-, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the thoughtswift- Visvakarman. May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid, whose works are righteous. Visvakarman. 82 1. THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness. Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the earth were far extended. 2 Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, Maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence. Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven Rsis. 3 Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races and all things existing, Even he alone, the Deities' narnegiverhim-, other beings seek for information. 4 To him in sacrifice they offered treasures, Rsis of old, in numerous troops, as singers, Who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all these things that have existence. 5 That which is earlier than this earth and heaven, before the Asuras and Gods had being, What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Gods were seen together? 6 The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Gods were gathefed all together. It rested set upon the Unborns' navel, that One wherein abide all things existing. 7 Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another thing hath risen up among you. Enwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymnchanters- wander and are discontented. Chhaya or Chaya (Sanskrit: छाया, Chāyā) means shadow or shade. Chhaya is also personified as the goddess of shadow, the consort of Surya, the Hindu sun god.[1] She is the shadow-image or reflection of Saranyu (Sanjna), the first wife of Surya. Chhaya was born from the shadow of Sanjna and replaced Sanjna in her house, after the latter abandoned her husband.[2]
Chhaya is usually described as the mother of Shani, the god of the planet Saturn and a feared graha; goddess Tapti, the personification of river Tapti and a son Savarni Manu, who is destined to be the next and eighth Manu (progenitor of mankind) - the ruler of the next Manvantara period.
Early Vedic and epic legends
In the Rigveda (c. 1200-1000 BCE), which is the earliest narrative about the Chhayaprototype. After the birth of twins to Vivasvan (Surya), his consort Saranyu - the daughter of Vishwakarma - abandons him and flews in form of a mare. The woman the divine Saranyu places in her place is called Savarna ("same-kind"): similar to Saranyu, but mortal. Savarna has no children by Surya. A later (500 BCE) addition to the Rigveda by Yaska in his Nikuta says that Manu (the progenitor of mankind, called Savarni Manu in later Puranic text) was born to Savarna. While the original text says "they" (interpreted as the gods) substituted Savarna for Saranyu, Yaksa's Nikuta tells that Saranyu created Savarna and



220
substituted her. Brhad devata calls the prototype of Chhaya as Sadrisha ("look-alike"), a woman who looked like Saranyu. Sadrsha begot Manu by Surya, who became a royal sage.
By the time of the Harivamsa (c. 5th century CE), an appendix of the epic Mahabharata; Saranyu is called Sanjna and her double is reduced to her shadow or reflection Chhaya. It narrates:[2] that Sanjna, after giving birth to three children of the Sun, abandons him, and leaves Chhaya to take care of her children. Surya mistakes Chhaya for Sanjna and begets Manu by her. As Manu looked just like his father, he was called Savarni Manu. When Chhaya, also called parthvi ("earthly") Sanjna, became partial to her own son and ignored those of Sanjna, Yama threatens her, and Chhaya casts a curse on Yama. Upon discovery of this, Surya threatens Chhaya, and she discloses the story of her creation; whereafter Surya finds Sanjna and brings her back. The text also states that Shani was a brother of Savarni Manu, though his birth is not explicitly stated.
Puranic legends
The Markandeya Purana tells the tale of Sanjna-Chhaya twice, the tale is similar to that in the Harivamsa, but Sanjna leaves Surya as she is unable to bear his splendour and heat. The curse to Yama is a little different. Yama abuses Chhaya and picks his leg up to kick her. Chhaya curses Yama to have his leg affected with worms and sores. Surya grants Yama, a cock to eat the worms from his leg. In the other telling, the curse is almost same as the Harivamsa. Chhaya also cleverly says that she is Yama's father's wife, but does not say that she is his mother.
The Vishnu Purana also records the legend similar to Markandeya Purana, but has few differences. Unable to bear Surya's intense heat, Sanjna after giving birth to three children retires to the forest to practise harsh austerities in form of a mare, leaving her shadow-image Chhaya, her handmaid to take her place and tend for her husband and progeny. Surya mistakes Chhaya for Sanjna and fathers three children on her. Chhaya gives birth to Shani, Savarni Manu and Tapti. However, Chhaya became partial to her own children and ignored those of Sanjna. Yama, suspected the behaviour of who he thought was his mother and offended her. Chhaya cast a curse on Yama (the details of the curse are not disclosed), which revealed to Yama and Surya that Chhaya was not the true Sanjna. After the extracting the truth from Chhaya, Surya finds Sanjna and brings her back.
The Matsya Purana also presents a similar account about Chhaya, however the children of Chhaya are named as Savarni Manu a son and two daughters: Tapti and Vishti, who was dark blue colour and a personification of Kala (Time or Death) who dwells in Hell. Chhaya's tale is also found in the 11th century CE Kathasaritsagara. The Markandeya Purana records that Chhaya had three sons: Shani, Savarni Manu and Revanta, the divine master of horses. Kurma Purana describes only Savarni Manu as her son.[9] While in some versions of the tale, Surya abandons Chhaya after knowing the truth about her, Surya deserts Chhaya before bringing back Sanjna. however a contemporary version tells that Chhaya was forgiven and lived with Surya, Sanjna and their children thereafter.
While most accounts consider Chhaya to be the reflection or shadow of Saranyu (Sanjna) Surya's first wife; Bhagavata Purana tells that Chhaya was a sister of Sanjna and the daughter of the divine architect Vishwakarma.
Markandeya Purana as well as Vishnudharmottara Purana prescribe that Surya should be depicted in images with Chhaya and his other wives by his sides.

Viktor Rydberg’s Investigations into Germanic Mythology published in 1886 and 1889 is seen as an account by a Swedish writer of undivided Proto-Indo-European people who ‘created the vessel of their worldview in myths.’ (Jan de Vries, 1961, Forschungsgeschichte der Mythologie, p.250).
Excerpt from 111. The results of the judgement on the Ivaldi sons’ artwork. Parallel myths in Rigveda [quote]...it has already been shown that the splinters of Proto-IndoEuropean mythology, which Avesta, Zend, and Bundehesh have [658] preserved, speak of a terrible winter, which afflicted the world. To rescue the most noble and the best among plants, animals, and humans from the coming destruction, Yima established an enclosed area in the underworld, inside of which a selection of natural organisms live an uncontaminated life, uninterrupted by the events on earth‘s surface, so that they may populate a more beautiful and a happier earth in the world‘s regeneration. I have shown that the same myth in all important details reappears in the Germanic doctrine about Mimir's grove and the ásmegir living there. The Iranian records inform us that the great winter was the work of the evil spirit, but they do not tell us the particulars of it or the epic causes of the cold‘s devastation. But the Iranian mythology‘s Indian sister informs us of it in Rigveda. Clothed with divine rank, there lives among Rigveda's gods an extraordinary artist, Tvashtar (Tvashtri), often mentioned and addressed in Rigveda's hymns. The word means "the foreman," "the craftsman" (Bergaigne, Relig. Ved., III, 45;[1] Darmesteter, Ormazd, 63, 2; 100).[2] He is the one who forms the organisms in their maternal wombs, the one who prepares and first owns as his secret the strength- and inspiration-endowing soma-juice (Rigv., II. 53, and many other places);[3] it is he that nurtures the generations (Rigv., III. 55, 19).[4] Among the wonderful work he crafted is mentioned a double-bowl or goblet, which is the gods‘ drinking-vessel, and which fills itself with blessings (Rigv., III, 55, 20; X. 53, 9),[5] and Indra's, the Indic Thor's, lightning-wedge, the counterpart to Mjölnir. But among mortals brothers have grown up, themselves mortal, and not of divine rank, but who have educated themselves into artists, whose skill fills the world with astonishment. They are three in number, usually called the Ribhus, but also the Anus and the Ayus, names which perhaps have some ancient fellowship with the Völund names Anund and Ajo. Most daring and enterprising in successful artistic experiments is the youngest of the three (Rigv., IV, 34). They are also soma-brewers, skalds, and heroes (Rigv., IV. 36, 5, 7), and one of them, like [659] Völund's brother Örvandil-Egil, is an unsurpassed archer (Rigv., IV. 36, 6). For their handiwork‘s sake, these mortal artists come in contact with the gods (Rigv., IV, 35), and as Völund and Örvandil-Egil become Thor's friends, allies, warcomrades, and servants, so the Ribhus become Indra's (Rigv., I 51, 2; VII. 37, 7): ―with Indra, the helpful, allied themselves the helpers; with Indra, the nimble Ribhus.‖[6] They forge weapons, armor, and means of transportation, and make noteworthy treasures for the gods. On the earth, they create vegetation in the deserts, and carve out ways for the fertilizing streams (Rigv., V. 42, 12; IV. 33, 7). With Ivaldi's sons, they, therefore, share the qualities of being simultaneously creators of vegetation, and smiths at the hearth, and bestowers of precious gifts to the gods. But some evil tongue persuaded the gods that the Ribhus had uttered something disdainful of the double-bowl or goblet made by Tvashtar. This provoked Tvashtar and he demanded their death. The gods then sent the fire-god Agni to the Ribhus. The Ribhus asked: ―Why has the most excellent, the most youthful come to us? On what mission does he come?‖[7] Agni let them know that they were supposed to have found fault with Tvashtar's goblet; but they assured him that they had not uttered anything derogatory, but only talked about the material of which it was made. Agni, however, presented the gods‘ resolution, which enjoined them to make from Tvashtar's goblet four of the same kind. If they were not able to do this, then the gods would yield to Tvashtar's claim on their lives; but if they could, then they, with the gods, would share the right to receive offerings. Yet,



222
moreover, they were to perform the following master test: they should smithy a living horse, a living vehicle, a living cow, and they should create a means of rejuvenation and demonstrate its efficacy on two beings, advanced in age and powerless. The Ribhus let the gods know that they would comply with the order. So they made the wonderful vehicle or the wagon-ship, which they gave to the Asvins, the beautiful twin-gods, on which they travel through the air and on the sea (Compare Skiðbladnir, Frey's ship, [660] and Hringhorni, Baldur's, and probably also Hödur's means of transportation through the air and on the sea). Of one horse they made two horses, and presented them to Indra. Out of an empty cowhide, they forged a cow (Compare Sindri's piece of art when, from an empty pigskin, he made the boar Sliðrugtanni). They made the requested means of rejuvenation, and tested it successfully on their aged parents. Finally, they even perform the great masterwork of producing from Tvashtar's goblet, four as good. Thereafter they appear before the gods who, "with insight," test their work.[8] Tvashtar himself could not help being astounded over the goblets. But the result of the gods‘ testing and judgment on the Ribhus‘ artwork was quite full of misfortune. Both Tvashtar and the Ribhus were dissatisfied. Tvashtar left the gods and proceeded to the mountains with his dises of vegetation, in whose society he is often mentioned. The Ribhus refused to receive the proffered share in the morning and noon sacrifices from the gods and, after laying curses on their adversaries, they went away on long wandering expeditions, and the gods knew not where to find them (Rigv., I. 161, 1-13; IV. 33, 1-11, and many other places). The result of this breach between the primeval artists themselves, and with the gods, becomes clear from the significance which Tvashtar, he who nourishes the world, and the Ribhus, who adorn the wastes with vegetation and who water the valleys, have as symbols of nature. The beneficent forces of nature, who previously had worked in the gods‘ service, abandon their cause, and over the world spreads that winter of which the Iranian myths speak, that darkness and that reign of giant-monsters which, according to Rigveda, once prevailed, and during which Indra, at the head of the gods, fought valiantly to restore order and to recapture the sun. Here we find remarkable points of contact, or rather contact surfaces, between the Asiatic Aryan and the Germanic mythic cycles. The concern is not similarities in individual details; such [similarities] can be pointed out in nearly all mythic cycles in the world, and, typically one builds altogether too dizzying [661] hypotheses on the weak foundations they offer. The concern here is commonality in great, central, connected complexes of myths: the myth about an original harmony between a divine clan and the subordinate and subservient artists, who forge fertility, ornaments and weapons for the gods, know how to brew the strength-endowing and inspiration-granting mead, and who are closely connected to vegetation-dises, who, as shall be shown later, appear as swanmaidens, not only in the Germanic godsaga but also in the Indic mythology; the myths of how this harmony was destroyed by the verdict of a trial, whose parties are, on the one side, he who forged Indra's thundering wedge in the Indic myths, and Thor's thundering hammer in the Germanic; and on the other side three brothers, of whom one is an excellent archer; the myth about the consequences of the judgment: nature‘s destruction by forces of frost or giant-monsters; the myth (in the earliest Iranian and the Germanic documents) of the subterranean pleasuregarden, in which a selection of creation‘s best beings are protected against annihilation, and survive uncorrupted through centuries; the myth (in the earliest Iranian and the Germanic documents) of these beings‘ destiny, which unites itself with the similarly common myth (in the Iranian and the Germanic mythic cycles) concerning the destruction and the renewal of the world. Common to the 14 IV, 33, 9. Indic and the Germanic mythologies too is that a cunning, spying being, in Rigveda Dadhyak (Dadhyank), in the Icelandic sources Loki, has forfeited his head to the artist who forged the wedge for Indra and the hammer for Thor, but saves it with cunning. An important observation should be pointed out here. A comparison between different passages in Rigveda demonstrates that of all the wonderful artworks that



223
were laid before the gods to examine, there was originally not one of metal. Tvashtar's doublebowl or goblet was not forged of gold, but of fire and water and a third element. Indra's wedge was made of the bones of Dadhyak's horse‘s head, and first became a weapon of bronze in a later tradition. Common to the Aryan-Asiatic and the Germanic mythologies is the primeval artists‘ ability [662] to forge animals from empty animal skins, and to make from one object of art several similar ones (the Ribhus‘ goblet, Sindri's Draupnir). Also, in the Germanic mythology, Thor's hammer was not originally of metal, but of stone, and the other artworks created by Sindri and the Ivaldi sons have probably undergone similar changes in the course of centuries, in regard to their raw materials. It should also be noted that not a trace of a myth comparable to that of Svipdag and the sword of victory is to be found in the Aryan-Asiatic mythic cycle. In the Germanic heroic saga, Geirvandil, the spear-fighter, is the father of Örvandil, the archer, and first born to him is Svipdag, the sword-fighter (compare no. 123). The myth about the sword of victory seems to be purely Germanic, and to have been established during the Bronze or Iron Ages, while the myth concerning the judgment on the primeval artists and of the fimbul-winter which follows must originate from a time when metals were not in use among the Indo-Europeans. Otherwise, it is most incredible to believe that the judgment would concern works of art of which not one originally suggested a metal product.[unquote] Source: Viktor Rydberg's Investigations into Germanic Mythology, Volume I Translated and annotated with modern references by William P.

But Yamas' Mother, Spouse of great Vivasvan, vanished as she was carried to her dwelling. 2 From mortal men they hid the Immortal Lady, made one like her and gave her to Vivasvan. Saranyu brought to him the Asvin brothers, and then deserted both twinned pairs of children. 3 Guard of the world, whose cattle Never are injured, may Pusan bear thee hence, for he hath knowledge. May he consign thee to these Fathers' keeping, and to the gracious Gods let Agni give thee. 4 May Ayu, giver of all life, protect thee, and bear thee forward on the distant pathway. Thither let Savitar the God transport thee, where dwell the pious who have passedbefore- thee. 5 Pusan knows all these realms: may he conduct us by ways that are most free from fear and danger. Giver of blessings, glowing, allheroic-, may he, thewise and watchful, go before us. 6 Pusan was born to move on distant pathways, on the road far from earth and far from heaven. To both most wonted places of assembly he travels and returns with perfect knowledge. 7 The pious call Sarasvati, they worship Sarasvati while sacrifice proceedeth. The pious called Sarasvati aforetime. Sarasvati send bliss to him who giveth. 8 Sarasvati, who camest with the Fathers, with them rejoicing thee in our oblations, Seated upon this sacred grass be joyful, and give us strengthening food that brings no sickness. 9 Thou, called on as Sarasvati by Fathers who come right forward to our solemn service, Give food and wealth to present sacrificers, a portion, worth a thousand, of refreshment. 10 The Mother Floods shall make us bright and shining, cleansers of holy oil, with oil shall cleanse us: For, Goddesses, they bear off all defilement: I, rise up from them purified and brightened. 11 Through days of earliest date the Drop descended on this place and on that which was before it. I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the Drop which still to one



226
same place is moving. 12 The Drop that falls, thy stalk which arms have shaken, which from the bosom of the press hath fallen, Or from the Adhvaryus' purifying filter, I offer thee with heart and cry of Vasat! 13 That fallen Drop of thine, the stalk which from the ladle fell away, This present God Brhaspati shall pour it forth to make us rich. 14 The plants of earth are rich in milk, and rich in milk is this my speech; And rich in milk the essence of the Waters: make me pure therewith. Wilson’s translation: 10.017.01 Tvas.t.a_ celebrates the marriage of his daughter; therefore, the whole world is assembled; but the mother of Yama, the newlymarried wife of the mighty Vivasvat, disappeared. [Deity Saran.yu_: The legend: Saran.yu_, the daughter of Tvas.t.a_, was given in marriage to Vivasvat, and had by him Yama and Yami_. Intimidated by his ardour, she substituted another female, her shadow, Cha_ya_, for herself, and going to Uttarakuru, changed herself to a mare. Vivasvat begot Manu by Cha_ya_, when, finding his error, he set off to look for his wife. Discovering her disguise, he transformed himself to a horse, and had by his wife the two As'vins]. 10.017.02 The gods concealing the immortal (Sarn.yu_) for the sake of mortals and having formed her, gave her to Vivasvat. She bore the two As'vins when this had happened and then Saran.yu_ gave birth to two twins. [For the sake of mortals: maryebhyah = manus.yebhyas tadutpattyartham, for men, i.e. that men might be born. Manu was the offspring of Vivasvat and the woman resembling Saran.yu_ and all men are descended from Manu; the two twins: Yama and Yami_, but dva_ mithuna_, may mean two pairs of twins, Yama and Yami_, the first pair and the As'vins the second]. 10.017.03 May the discriminating Pu_s.an, whose cattle are never lost, the protector of all beings, transfer you hence (to a better world); may he give you to these Pitr.s; may Agni (give) you to the beneficent gods. [This and the following three r.cas are to be recited at the funeral rites of a man who has been duly initiated, di_ks.ita]. 10.017.04 May the all-pervading Va_yu protect you, may Pu_s.an (preserve) you, (going) first on the excellent path (to heaven); may the divine Savita_ place you, where the virtuous abide, whither they have gone.

[quote]Tuisto, Tvastar & Ymir Connections have been proposed between the 1st century figure of Tuisto and the hermaphroditic primeval being Ymir in later Norse mythology, attested in 13th century sources, based upon etymological and functional similarity. Meyer (1907; loc. cit. North, Richard, 1997, Heathen Gods in Old English Literature. Cambridge University Press, p.269) sees the connection as so strong, that he considers the two to be identical. Lindow (Lindow, John, 2001, Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs, Oxford
Univ. Press, p. 296), while mindful of the possible semantic connection between Tuisto and Ymir, notes an essential functional difference: while Ymir is portrayed as an "essentially... negative figure" – Tuisto is described as being "celebrated" (celebrant) by the early Germanic peoples in song, with Tacitus reporting nothing negative about Tuisto.
Jacob (Jacob, Alexander, 2005, Ātman: A Reconstruction of the Solar Cosmology of the IndoEuropeans. Georg Olms Verlag, p.232) attempts to establish a genealogical relationship between Tuisto and Ymir based on etymology and a comparison with (post-)Vedic Indian mythology: as Tvastr, through his daughter Saranyū and her husband Vivaswān, is said to have been the grandfather of the twins Yama and Yami, so Jacob argues that the Germanic Tuisto (assuming a connection with Tvastr) must originally have been the grandfather of Ymir (cognate to Yama). Incidentally, Indian mythology also places Manu (cognate to Germanic Mannus), the Vedic progenitor of mankind, as a son of Vivaswān, thus making him the brother of Yama/Ymir. [unquote]

[1] Bergaigne defines the name as taksh, charpenter, (carpenter), ouvrer (workman). [2] Darmesteter defines the name as: le Créateur, (Creator), l’Ordonnateur (Ordainer), le Formateur (Trainer). [3] This reference is erroneous. Rigveda Book 2 has 43 verses. Rigv. II, 23, 17 may have been intended. It reads: ―For Tvastar, he who knows each sacred song, brought thee to life, preeminent o‘er all the things that be,‖ [Griffith tr.] As Rydberg indicates, the statements are well-supported. For example: Rigv. I, 117, 22: ―sweet Soma, Tvastar‘s secret‖; I, 188, 9: ―Tvastar the Lord hath made all forms and all the cattle of the field.‖; III, 48, 4: ―E'en from his birth-time Indra conquered Tvastar, bore off the Soma and in beakers drank it.‖; IV, 18, 3: ―In Tvastar's dwelling India drank the Soma.‖; X, 10, 5 ―Even in the womb God Tvastar, Vivifier, shaping all forms, Creator, made us consorts.‖; X, 184, 1: ―May Visnu form and mould the womb, may Tvastar duly shape the forms.‖ [Griffith tr.] [4] Bergaigne, III, p. 40: ―III.55.19:  ̳The god Tvastr Savitr who assumes all forms, nourishes the created beings; he engenders them in a large number and all the worlds belong to him.‖ [Paranjpe tr.]; ―Tvasṭar the god, the omniform. Creator, begets and feeds mankind in various manner.‖ [Griffith tr]:.

[5] Rigv. III, 55, 20: ―The two great meeting Bowls hath he united: each of the Pair is laden with his treasure.”; .X, 53, 9: ―Tvastar, most deft of workmen, knew each magic art, bringing most blessed bowls that hold the drink of Gods,‖ [Griffith tr.]. [6] This appears to be the first part of Rigv. I, 51, 2. Alfred Ludwig‘s German translation (1876) begins: ―es verbanden sich mit ihm dem hilfreichen die helfer,‖ [Der Rigveda, no. 966, p. 599]. Ralph Griffith‘s reads: ―As aids the skilful Ṛbhus yearned to Indra strong to save.‖; VII, 37, 7 refers to ―three close friends‖ of Indra‘s without naming the Ribhus.
Tvaṣṭṛ as Viśvákarma, kāru 'smith', cire perdue metalcaster, revealer of sthApatyaveda. Role of scribes, architects in Hindu civilization.
Mirror: http://tinyurl.com/oh6s7nl
Role of scribes, architects in Hindu civilization is a saga of unparalleled splendor in the history of civilizations.
Many scribes and silpi or sthapati are unnamed since the tradition was to venerate the supreme, humbling oneself in veneration. The contributions made by scribes and sculptors are cherished as pilgrimage sites, temples and monuments in all parts of Bharatam.
The scribes who created the catalogus catalogorum of Indus Script with ca. 7000 inscriptions and perhaps also many hieroglyphs in cuneiform inscriptions on cylinder seals of Ancient Near East from Meluhha colonies of the region, clearly followed the characteristics of orthographic rendering of hieroglyphs associated with Tvaṣṭṛ as Viśvákarma.
The metalworkers of the civilization viewed kole.l 'smithy' as kole.l 'temple. This tradition is traceable to the narratives related to Tvaṣṭṛ as Viśvákarma in the Vedic tradition, dating from the Rigveda.
Tvaṣṭṛ as Viśvákarma is a Rsi and a Silpi, designer of all the flying chariots of the gods, and all their weapons and divine attributes, creator of vajra (thunderbolt) missile for Indra from the bones of Dadhici. He is artisan, craftsman par excellence. (Coomaraswamy, Ananda K. (1979): Medieval Sinhalese Art, Pantheon Books Inc., New York., p.79). Kanya Sankranti after Ganesha Puja (ca. September) is a celebration of Viśvákarma.
Vishwakarma (or Visvakarma) community refer to themselves as the Viswabrahmin. The community comprises five sub-groups
- carpenters, blacksmiths, bell metalworkers, goldsmiths and stonemasons - who believe that they are descendants of Vishwakarma. Lohars are also known as Vishwakarma, Sharma or Panchals.
Viśwákarma (Sanskrit: शवर्श्कमाण "all-accomplishing, maker of all," "all doer"; Thai: Witsawakam ; Telugu: విశ్ా కయమ ; Kannada: ವ ಶ್ವಿ ಕರ್ಮ ; Tamil: (விசுேகர்மன் ) Visuvakaruman ) is the personified Omnipotence and the abstract form of the creator God according to the Rigveda. He is the presiding deity of all craftsmen and architects. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishvakarman

Tarcan or Turgan) is an ancient Central Asian title used by various Indo-European (i.e. Iranian and Tokharian) and Turco-Mongol peoples, especially in the medieval era, and prominent among the successors of the Mongol Empire. It is also the title given to a community commonly found in the Punjab regions of India and Pakistan. Who are traditionally carpenters by occupation.

Rigveda 10.81-82



239
10.081.01 The r.s.i, the hota_, our father who offering all these worlds has taken his seat; desiring wealth by pious benedictions, the first inventor has entered inferior (beinggs). [Offering all these worlds: i.e., destroying at the pral.aya, or dissolution of the world (Yajus. 17.17); asi_dat = had stopped, or has sat down in Agni. The 'wealth' desired by Vis'vakarma_ is heaven, which is to be obtained by hymns and the like. a_s'is.a_ = by the wish to become many; or, by the desire to create again and again; prathamacchad = assuming the principal form, or first investing, Agni with the worlds; Parames'vara is intended: a_tma_ va_ idam eka eva_gra a_si_t: Aitareya Bra_hman.a 2.4.1; Nirukta, 10.26: Vis'vakarman was at a sarvamedha, or universal sacrifice; he offered up all the worlds, and last of all offered up himself in sacrifice. The first line of the r.ca is a reference to the destuction of all things; the second line of the r.ca refers to their re-creation].
10.081.02 What was the station? What was the material? How was (it done)? So that the beholder of all, Vis'vakarman (was) generating and disclosed heaven by his might. [In the first r.ca, it is said that after the pral.aya, the creator made all things anew. In this r.ca, it is now asked: where was the scene of action, what were the materials, and how was thw work performed? In this world, a potter must have his shop, his clay, his wheel; so what does Is'vara have for site, matter and implements? The answer is negative. Is'vara does not need anything of this kjind. tatsr.s.t.va_ tadeva_nupra_vis'at: Taittiri_ya A_ran.yaka 8.6].



240
10.081.03 Having eyes everywhere, and having a face everywhere, having arms everywhere, and having feet everywhere, he traverses (heaven) with his arms, (earth) with his swift-moving (feet), and exists a god without companion generating heaven and earth. [Traverses: sam dhamati = he blows together, or inflates; a metaphor to denote the work of creation].
10.081.04 Which was the forest, which the tree, from which they fabricated heaven and earth? Inquire, sages, in your minds what (place) he was stationed in when holding the worlds. [They: i.e., the makers of the world, directed by Parames'vara].
10.081.05 Grant to your friends, Vis'vakarman, at the oblation, your best, your worst and your intermediate forms, and to these do you yourself, possessor of the oblation, becoming augmented in person (by oblations), offer worship. [Your best...forms: The best forms are the bodies of the gods, etc.; the intermediate forms are the bodies of men, etc.; the inferior forms are the bodies of worms, etc. Vis'vakarman, the creator is mixed up with Vis'vakarman, as Tvas.t.a_ or Agni. It means that man is incompetent to worship the creator, that is, in his forms, and it must be done by himself].
10.081.06 VIs'vakarman, magnified by the oblation, do you of yourself worship earth and heaven; let other men (who offer no oblations) be everywhere confounded; may he, rich in oblations, be the granter of heaven at this our (sacrifice). [Magnified by oblation: or, by me, Vis'vakarman, becoming an oblation. In the previous r.ca., havis.a_ = at the oblation = when I am made an oblation; cf. Nirukta 10.27; Yajus. 17.22; su_rih = prajn~a_ta, knowing; or, may Indra be our adviser].
10.081.07 Let us this day invoke for our protection the lord of speech, the creator of all, who is swift as thought; may he, the bestower of all happiness, the doer of good works, be propitiated by all our oblations, (so as) to grant us his protection. [Lord of speech: all the epithets apply to Indra; Yajus. 8.45; 17.23].



241
10.082.01 The maker of the senses, resolute in mind, engendered the water, (and then) these two (heaven and earth) floating (on the waters); when those ancient boundaries were fixed, then the heaven and earth were expanded. [The maker of the senses: lit., the father of the eye; manasa_ dhi_rah = reflecting that there was no one equal to himself; a_po va_ idam agre; a_pa eva sasarja_dau: Taittiri_ya Sam.hita_ 7.1.5.1; Manu 1.8].
10.082.02 Vis'vakarman, of comprehensive mind and manifold greatness, is all-pervading, the creator, the arranger and the supreme supervisor; him in whom the desires of their (senses) are satisfied with food, they call (him) supreme beyond the seven r.s.is. [The devata_: is Prama_tma_ or A_ditya, the sun; cf. Nirukta 10.26. The second line of the r.ca: him in whom they delight their forms (or places) with water, him, those who are skille din mantras call the A_ditya single, superior to the seven r.s.is; or, the wise make the seven r.s.is one with Vis'vakarman; Nirukta notes that at the universal sacrifice Vis'vakarman Bhauvana offered up all beings and then himself]. 10.082.03 He who is our preserver, our parent, the creator (of all), who knows our abodes (and knows) all beings, who is the name-giver of the



242
gods-- he is one; other beings come to him to inquire. [i.e., to ask, 'who is the supreme lord?' or, they ask, what their offices are, and he appoints them their several functions]. 10.082.04 Those ancient R.s.is who adorned (with light) these beings in the animate and inanimate world, offer to him wealth (of sacrifice) as praisers with abundant (laudation). 10.082.05 What was that embryo which was beyond the heaven, beyond this earth, beyond the gods, beyond the asuras, which the waters first retained, in which all the gods contemplated each other? 10.082.06 The waters verily first retained the embryo in which all the gods were aggregated, single deposited on the navel of the unborn (creator), in which all beings abide. [The embryo is Vis'vakarman. arpitam an.d.am = mundane egg; or, bi_jam]. 10.082.07 You know not him who has generated these (beings); (his life) is another, different from yours; wrapped in fog, and foolish speech (do they) wander (who are) gluttonous and engaged in devotion. [Sa_yan.a: "The assertion that we know Vis'vakarman in the same way as men say, 'I am devadatta, I am yajn~adatta', is false, for the essence (tattva) of Vis'vakarman Parames'vara is not endowed with conscious individual existence, but he is a different entity from you who are sentient beings, who have individual consciousness, and so forth". Wrapped in foolish speech: jalpya_: i.e., saying I am god, I am man etc.; ukthas'a_sah = singing hymns with a view to gaining felicity in a future state: you are merely anxious for enjoyment in this world and in the next, therefore you know nothing of Vis'vakarman; or, you who are engaged in enjoyment of this world or the next, being subject to false knowledge or ignorance, have no knowledge of the Truth].

She extended, she became the earth, and hence the earth is called the earth (lit. the extended In her Prajapati made effort. He produced the gods, Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas.
