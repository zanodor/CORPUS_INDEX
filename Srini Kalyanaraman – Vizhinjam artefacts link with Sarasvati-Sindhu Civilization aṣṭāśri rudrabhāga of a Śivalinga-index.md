A remarkable discovery is the octoganal brick which is a yaṣṭi.in a fire-altar of Bijnor site on the banks of Vedic River Sarasvati. Thi yaṣṭi attests to the continuum of the Vedic tradition of fire-altars venerating the yaṣṭi as a baton, skambha of divine authority which transforms mere stone and earth into metal ingots, a manifestation of the cosmic dance enacted in the furnace/smelter of a smith. Bhuteswar sculptural friezes provide evidence to reinforce this divine dispensation by describing the nature of the smelting process displaying a tree to signify kuTi rebus: kuThi 'smelter' with kharva 'dwarf' adorning the structure with a garland to signify kharva 'a nidhi or wealth' of Kubera. A Bhutesvar frieze also indicates the skambha with face signifying ekamukha linga rebus:
mũ he 'ingot' (Santali) mũh ã̄ = the quantity of iron produced at one time in a native smelting furnace of the Kolhes; iron produced by the Kolhes and formed like a four-cornered piece a little pointed at each end; mūhā mẽṛhẽt = iron smelted by the Kolhes and formed into an equilateral lump a little pointed at each of four ends;kolhe tehen mẽṛhẽt ko mūhā akata = the Kolhes have to-day produced pig iron (Santali) kuti 'tree' rebus: kuthi 'smelter'. .
After Plate 8 in Kumar et al opcit. Śivalinga found in Vizhinjam 1st cent. CE? The octagonal shape of Rudrabhāga compareswith the aṣṭāśri octagonal yupa found in Binjor Yajna kunda (ca. 2500 BCE).
Vizhinjam a port city of Ay Velir kings & also a military base. There is a rock cut temple made by Ay Kings in 8th century.
Interestingly the temple has Veenadhara Dakshināmoorthi in the sanctum which is quite unique. The outer wall has Tripurāntaka on one side and Śiva & Parvathy on the other with Śiva in dancing pose. The temple seems to be unfinished, may be due to the recurring wars.
