Kartikeya and his Grand Spouses on Indus seals
H-95 b
After studying Indus seals for many years, it seemed to me that goddesses, like Shashthi, Valli and Devasena were very important in the Indus Valley Civilization. Sometimes it looked as if they were even more important than their husband Kartikeya.
The above tablet depicts the storm goddess Devasena, who is indicated by the antler on her head. She is naked, has long hair and has bracelets around both her arms.
Number 1
Like this goddess, who is also naked, has long hair and has bracelets around her left arm. But, she holds a pitcher in her hand, which indicates that she is the moon goddess Shashthi:
‘Shashthi (-) She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants. She is symbolically represented in a variety of forms, including an earthenware pitcher, a banyan tree or part of it or a red stone beneath such a tree; outdoor spaces termed shashthitala are also consecrated for her worship.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi



From H-2023 A to H-2031B
That goddesses are important is clearly visible on these 4 tablets, which all show the same inscription and the same 3 images.
H-2027 c
On one of the four sides we see a struggle between a bull and a human and on the right is a neem tree.
o The bull represents the sun god Kartikeya in Taurus. o The human represents his spouse, the river goddess Valli. o And the neem tree represents Shitala (which means: ‘One Who Cools’) ‘who is considered to reside within this tree’.
Trees And Religion: Hinduism
Both the tree and the struggle indicate that the river goddess is trying to cool down her burning husband and just like the healing goddess Shitala she may try to find a balance between heat and cold.
More about this struggle between Kartikeya and Valli, see; https://www.academia.edu/11686315/Kartikeya_and_his_wives_Devasena_and_Valli_on_Indus_seals



H-2027 d
The second side of the tablet shows this grand goddess with long hair and bracelets. She is the storm goddess Devasena, the second spouse of Kartikeya. She is indicated by her tusk as she is also called ‘Deivanai’ or ‘Deivayanai’, which means ‘celestial elephant’:
‘She is called Deivanai or Deivayanai (Tamil, literally meaning ‘celestial elephant’), as she was raised by Indra's divine elephant Airavata.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devasena
H-2027 b
The third side of the tablet shows the river goddess Valli again. With her bracelets she sits on a tiger bench in a yogi-position, which symbolizes that she is wise, just like the river goddess Saraswathi.
‘Saraswati (Sanskrit: सरस्वती , Sarasvatī) is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, art, wisdom, and learning. She is a part of the trinity (Tridevi) of Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati. All the three forms help the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva to create, maintain, and regenerate-recycle the Universe, respectively.’
https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Saraswati
The tiger bank represents Kartikeya, her husband. The storm goddess Devasena, with bracelets around both her arms, sits next to her and listens to her.
It is clear that seated on the tiger bench the wise river goddess completely dominates her husband, the god of the sun.



Number 2
All of this is completely different from what we see on this Achaemenian (?) cylinder seal. Here the great Ashur (which means ‘Whole Heaven’) slays the salt water goddess Tiamat when walking exalted above his modest wife Kishar (which means ‘Whole Earth’), who is depicted as a small sphinx,
‘ASHUR - The Assyrian god of the sky and of war known as The Lord of the Whole Heavens. His name means `whole heaven' in Akkadian and he was the supreme god of the Assyrian pantheon. He is often depicted as a feather-robed archer drawing a bow riding on a serpent or dragon’.
‘When Assyria conquered Babylon in the Sargonid period (8th–7th centuries BC), Assyrian scribes began to write the name of Ashur with the cuneiform signs 𒀭𒊹 AN.ŠAR2, the ideograms for ‘whole heaven’ in Sumerian, which may have been pronounced similarly to Aššur in Akkadian, the language of Assyria and Babylonia. The intention seems to have been to put Aššur at the head of the Babylonian pantheon, where Anshar and his counterpart Kishar (‘whole earth’) preceded even Enlil and Ninlil. Thus in the Sargonid version of the Enuma Elish, the Babylonian national creation myth, Marduk, the chief god of Babylon, does not appear, and instead it is Ashur, as Anshar, who slays Tiamat the chaos-monster and creates the world of humankind.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashur_(god)



The birth of Saraswathi
M-1425 At
On the right side of this tablet is a goddess lying upside down and giving birth to a crocodile. Today a crocodile is the mount of the river goddess Ganges or the water god Varuna, but at the time of the Indus Valley Civilization this animal represented the river goddess Yami or Valli. Of course, the birth of the river goddess is of great importance in the Indus Valley Civilization.
The birth goddess lies upside-down: in this way her legs more or less form a pitcher which is the symbol for a womb as well as the mother goddess Shashti (see below).
M-13
On this tablet the river goddess Valli is surrounded by her animal symbols: crocodiles and fish and by two meandering lines. She sits in a yogi position, which symbolizes that she is wise, just like Sarasvati, who brightens every pious thought:
Rig Veda hymn, 1-3 called: ‘Asvins’
11 ‘Inciter of all pleasant songs, inspirer o all gracious thought, Sarasvati accept our rite 12 Sarasvati, the mighty flood, - she with be light illuminates, She brightens every pious thought.’



M-440 AC
And this seal shows a crocodile large and centrally placed, demonstrating the importance of the river goddess, who is not only wise, but she also gives wealth with noble offspring:
Rig Veda hymn, 3-54 called: ‘Visvedevas’
13 ‘Borne on their flashing car, the spear-armed Maruts, the nimble Youths of Heaven, the Sons of Order,
The Holy, and Sarasvati, shall hear us: ye Mighty, give us wealth with noble offspring.’
Number 3
And on this tablet the river goddess is struggling again with her husband, the sun god Kartikeya. This scene shows that the goddess is also a warrior who is able to slay the foe:
Rig Veda hymn 6-61 called; ‘Sarasvati’
6 ‘Aid us, divine Sarasvad, thou who art strong in wealth and power Like Pusan, give us opulence. 7 Yea, this divine Sarasvati, terrible with her golden path, Foe-slayer, claims our eulogy.
8 Whose limitless unbroken flood, swift-moving with a rapid rush, Comes onward with tempestuous roar. 9 She hath spread us beyond all foes, beyond her Sisters, Holy One, As Surya spreadeth out the days. 10 Yea, she most dear amid dear stream, Seven-sistered, graciously inclined, Sarasvati hath earned our praise. 11 Guard us from hate Sarasvati, she who hath filled the realms of earth, And that wide tract, the firmament!’



M-1429 Ct
And a crocodile that grabs a fish with its mouth is depicted on many tablets and seals. They represent river goddesses like Sarasvati, who is mightiest, etc. etc.:
Rig Veda hymn 7-96 called; ‘Sarasvati’
1. ‘I sing a lofty song, for she is mightiest, most divine of Streams. Sarasvati will I exalt with hymns and lauds, and, O Vasistha, Heaven and Earth. 2 When in the fulness of their strength the Purus dwell, Beauteous One, on thy two grassy banks, Favour us thou who hast the Maruts for thy friends: stir up the bounty of our chiefs. 3 So may Sarasvati auspicious send good luck; she, rich in spoil, is never niggardly in thought, When praised in jamadagni's way and lauded as Vasistha lauds. 4 We call upon Sarasvan, as unmarried men who long for wives, As liberal men who yearn for sons. 5 Be thou our kind protector, O Sarasvan, with those waves of thine Laden with sweets and dropping oil. 6 May we enjoy Sarasvan's breast, all-beautiful, that swells with streams, May we gain food and progeny.’
M-478 A
And on this tablet someone sacrifices for a neem tree, which represents the river goddess Valli. The scene is similar to what we read in a Rig Veda hymn for Sarasvati:
Rig Veda hymn 7-95 called; ‘Sarasvati’
4 ‘May this Sarasvati be pleased and listen at this our sacrifice, auspicious Lady,
When we with reverence, on our knees, implore her close-knit to wealth, most kind to those she loveth. 5 These offerings have ye made with adoration: say this, Sarasvati, and accept our praises; And, placing us under thy dear protection, may we approach thee, as a tree, for shelter. 6 For thee, O Blest Sarasvati, Vasistha hath here unbarred the doors d sacred Order. Wax, Bright One, and give strength to him who lauds thee. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.’



Number 4
The relationship between rivers and trees is obvious: especially in the desserts of Pakistan trees grow on the river banks.
Number 5
The contrast between the previous Indus tablet and this Elamite cylinder seal cannot be greater: on the tablet the river god Valli is worshiped in the form of a neem tree, but on this cylinder seal the sun god Nergal, who is punishing his father, is the one who is worshiped.



The grant goddesses
M-704 a
On this seal the moon goddess Shashti holds ‘a knife-standard’ in her hand. It is depicted on many seals and it always indicates one of the wives of Kartikeya. It is similar to a Sumerian archaic sign:
Archaic Sumerian Pictographic Signs by Ashur Cherry
In Sumer this sign means ‘gal’, which can be translated as: ‘big’:
‘gal [BIG] (6612x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. gal; gu-la; gu-ul; gal-gal; ku-ul ‘(to be) big, great; (to be) retired, former; (to be) mature (of male animals)’ Akk. rabû ‘big; noble, chief of...’.
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
M-1981 a
In Akkad this sign means rabû, which is translated as: ‘big; noble and chief of...’ It may symbolize that Shashti is great or big:
‘This merger created a ‘new’ Shashthi that was associated in various ways with Skanda (also known as Kartikeya or Murugan). From her origins as a folk goddess, Shashthi was gradually assimilated into the Brahmanical Hindu pantheon, and ultimately, came to be known in Hinduism as the Primordial Being and Great Mother of all.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi



Kalibangan-26
On this seal Shashthi is indicated three times:
1. The unicorn represents her as well as her husband Kartikeya. 2. The banyan tree symbolically represents her. 3. And the pitcher symbolically represents her too.
‘Shashthi or Shashti (-) is a Hindu folk goddess, venerated as the benefactor and protector of children (especially, as the giver of male child). She is also the deity of vegetation and reproduction and is believed to bestow children and assist during childbirth. She is often pictured as a motherly figure, riding a cat and nursing one or more infants. She is
symbolically represented in a variety of forms, including an earthenware pitcher, a banyan tree or part of it or a red stone beneath such a tree; outdoor spaces termed shashthitala are also consecrated for her worship.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashthi
This pitcher has two meanings:
o As a cup it holds the soma drink. o An it also looks like an Omega sign which symbolizes birth.
Number 8
The Egyptians could transform the Omega symbol into a hair dress of the mother goddess Hathor.
‘Hathor was a major goddess in ancient Egyptian religion who played a wide variety of roles. As a sky deity, she was the mother or consort of the sky god Horus and the sun god Ra, both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the pharaohs.’
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathor



Number 6
The U-sign is similar to the U-form of the belt of this sculpture of Saraswathi which emphasises her genitals.
Here we can recognize a so called: ‘kumbha’ symbol on this Hindu sculpture: the draped piece of cloth forms more or less a kumbha and emphasises the fertility of this goddess.
‘According to Hindu mythology, the first kumbha was created by Praja-pati’ and ‘in the context of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist mythology, the kumbha symbolises the womb:’
‘A kumbha is a type of pottery in India. Traditionally, it is made by Kumbhars, also known as Prajapatis.
In the context of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist mythology, the kumbha symbolises the womb. It represents fertility, life, generative power of human beings and sustenance and is generally associated with devis, particularly Ganga.
According to Hindu mythology, the first kumbha was created by Praja-pati on the occasion of the marriage of Shiva, so he was first kumbhara ‘potter’.

The birth of a grant goddess
H-178 A
There is a big difference between the two sides of this tablet: on this front side there are three signs symbolizing four deities:
1. The U-sign indicates Shashthi, (the U) as well as Kartikeya (the four stripes) 2. The figure in the middle represents the storm goddess Devasena. 3. The figure on the right is a styled prisoner, who represents the river goddess Valli: she is imprisoned in winter.
So, these three signs indicate Kartikeya and his three spouses.
In Rigveda hymn 5-43 we read that Indra is a steer with triple horns:
Rigveda 5-43 called: ‘Visvedevas’.
5 ‘The Soma hath been pressed for thee, its lover, to give thee power and might and high enjoyment. Invoked, turn hither in thy car, O Indra, at need, thy two well-trained and dear Bay Horses. 6 Bring by God-traversed paths, accordant, Agni, the great Aramati, Celestial Lady, Exalted, worshipped with our gifts and homage, who knoweth holy Law, to drink sweet Soma. (-) 12 Set in his seat the God whose back is dusky, Brhaspati the lofty, the Disposer. Him let us worship, set within the dwelling, the red, the golden-hued, the allresplendent. 13 May the Sustainer, high in heaven, come hither, the Bounteous One, invoked, with all his favours, Dweller with Dames divine, with plants, unwearied, the Steer with triple horn, the life-bestower’.
The figure in the middle may have three horns instead of a head: in the Rigveda the storm god Indra has three horns but on this seal the storm goddess Devasena may be represented by this figure.



H-178 B
On the other side is Devasena depicted as a grand river goddess (with her bracelets around her arms). The three sparkles on her head may indicate the three horns. Here she is standing within an Omega sign, which symbolizes that she is newly born.
M-305AC
Here Devasena sits is a yoga position, she bears three horns on her head: two of a cow and one antler, which indicates that she is a storm goddess.



M-442 A M-442 B
These are the two sides of one tablet showing about the same images. The only differences is that on top of the left side are six goddesses and on top of the right sight are seven goddesses.
On the left the six goddesses may represent the six mothers of Kartikeya. The figures below may indicate Kartikeya and his three wives:
o The figure on the left is Devasena. o The markhor goat represents the river goddess Valli o The U-sign with banyan leaves symbolizes Shashthi. o In this U-sign is a human like figure who must be Kartikeya. This scene shows that this god is united with the moon goddess.
On the right are the seven river goddesses, who are frequently mentioned in the Rigveda:
Rigveda 1-32 called: ‘Indra’.
12 ‘A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second, Thou hast won back the kine, hast won the Soma; thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers’.
According to this hymn Indra hast let loose them, but on the above tablet Indra may have been replaced by the storm goddess Devasena.
o This time the figure on the left is Kartikeya. o The markhor goat represents the river goddess Valli o Again, the U-sign with banyan leaves symbolizes Shashthi. o This time Devasena may be situated within this U sign and now this scene may symbolize that Shashthi gives birth to the storm goddess.
Many times man and wife are depicted alike on Indus seals and on the above tablet Kartikeya and Devasena are similar too: the only differences are that on the left Kartikeya is indicated by six goddesses and that he is united with Shashthi and that on the right Devasena is indicated by seven goddesses and that she is newly born.



H-177 B
Valli Kartikeya Shashthi Devasena
Here we see something similar:
o On the left the markhor goat represents the river goddess Valli o The figure in the middle is Kartikeya. o The U-sign with eight banyan leaves symbolizes Shashthi. o Because of the eight leaves the figure within the U-sign may be Devasena, who is newly born. Like Indra she may also be related to number eight.
Rigveda 1-121 called: ‘Indra’. 8 ‘Eight steeds thou broughtest down from mighty heaven, when fighting for the well that giveth splendour’.
Published: Black and Green 2003, p.146
The U-sign looks like this Omega. In ‘Archaic seal-impressions from Ur’ Leon Legrains writes about this sign:
‘A symbol approximating in form to an upright or inverted capital Greek letter Omega, but with a number of minor variations, is the first attested on an impression from an Early Dynastic seal, and is represented commonly from the Old Babylonian to the Neo-Babylonian Periods. It has variously been interpreted by modern-commentators as a representation of weighing-scales, the yoke of a chariot-pole, a comet, a large horned quadruped, a head-bad, a wig, the bands used to swaddle a baby or as the uterus. Supporters of the last two suggestions usually connect the symbol with the mother goddess Ninhursaga, or with Nintu.. Some Isin-Larsa or Old Babylonian Period plaques of clay with moulded relief show a goddess (probably Nintu) flanked by inverted 'Omega' motifs beneath which sit human forms resembling new-born babies, as if newly emerged from the womb....’



M-1186 A
On this tablet the red circled head on a so-called plateau is Kartikeya. He is astonishingly small compared to the grand goddesses that surround him. He is that small because every year he is born again in March.
o On the right the markhor goat represents the river goddess Valli, she brings forth the fish depicted above her. o In the middle is the storm goddess Devasena, she brings forth the grain she is wearing on her head. o The U-sign with six banyan leaves symbolizes Shashthi who brings forth soma. Here the god of this ritual drink is situated within the pitcher of the moon goddess.
The soma drink is regarded as a deity: like a steer he bellows in the wooden vats. As he is newly born he is a child and hymns have been sung for him:
Rigveda 9-86 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
31 Onward the Singer travels o'er the fleecy sieve. the Tawny Steer hath bellowed in the wooden vats. Hymns have been sung aloud in resonant harmony, and holy songs kiss him, the Child who claims our praise.
This soma deity look like seven goddesses, who are his mothers:
Rigveda 9-86 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
36 The Sisters Seven, the Mothers, stand around the Babe, the noble, new-born Infant, skilled in holy song, Gandharva of the floods, divine, beholding men, Soma, that he may reign as King of all the world.



M-488Ct
Kartikeya Devasena Valli Shashti Soma
o On this tablet the red circled head on a so-called plateau is the sun god. Once again, he is small compared to the grand goddesses in front of him. o The second figure is Devasena with her three horns. o The markhor goat represents the river goddess Valli. o On the right Shashti is symbolized by the U-sign made of branches of a banyan tree. o On the right the human figure may represent the deity of the soma drink.
On this tablet this soma deity is newly born, he is a child adorned by Kartikeya, Devasena and Valli:
Rigveda 9-102 called: ‘Soma Pavamana’.
1. ‘The Child, when blended with the streams, speeding the plan of sacrifice, Surpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old. 2 The place, near the two pressing-stones of Trita, hath he occupied, Secret and dear through seven lights of sacrifice. 3 Urge to three courses, on the heights of Trita, riches in a stream. He who is passing wise measures his courses out.
4 Even at his birth the Mothers Seven taught him, for glory, like a sage, So that he, firm and sure, hath set his mind on wealth. 5 Under his sway, of one accord, are all the guileless Deities: Warriors to be envied, they, when they are pleased. 6 The Babe whom they who strengthen Law have generated fair to see, Much longed for at the sacrifice, most liberal Sage,
7 To him, united, of themselves, come the young Parents of the rite, When they adorn him, duly weaving sacrifice.
8 With wisdom and with radiant eyes unbar to us the stall of heaven, Speeding at solemn rite the plan of Holy Law’.
It is clear that goddesses were important in the Indus Valley Civilisation. Because of the dominance of the goddesses the question arises: ‘What kind of a society was this Civilisation?’
