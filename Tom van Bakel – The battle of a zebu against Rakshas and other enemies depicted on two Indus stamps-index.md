# Index for Tom van Bakel – The battle of a zebu against Rakshas and other enemies depicted on two Indus stamps.pdf

The battle of a zebu against Rakshas and other enemies depicted on two Indus stamps
It was a great surprise to me to discover that the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 was fully known in the Indus Valley Civilization, and that by means of this Sutra we can understand almost all the signs depicted on the stamps found in in cities as Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro: gods or ritual acts described in this Sutra are symbolized or indicated by means of simple signs or scenes.
In this essay I discuss three special stamps. Two of them depict a battle between a zebu and five opponents, and another one depicts four tridents in succession. Without the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra these stamps could never be understood.
M-312
On this stamp a zebu battles with five opponents. This bull embodies the Soma drug, and from the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 we can understand that this is a special drink or a prepared amount of food that can produce a certain effect. Let me give an example: in Khanda 21 we read that in the fourth month the man besmears the limbs of his wife with Âgya salve (a kind of Soma!) to drive away malady:
3. With (the verses), verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
Rigveda 10-163 hymn CLXIII
1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin, Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,
From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart,
From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet,
From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails,
From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
It appears that in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Soma is used five times to drive away malady or to protect the mother or the child. This expelling of all kinds of evil by means of this drug is symbolized on this stamp by the zebu fighting against five opponents.



M-1123 A
And here is a beautiful zebu, nevertheless, the special features of this stamp are of course the four tridents that are neatly arranged one behind the other. As said before, the zebu embodies Soma: it is a drug that drives away Rakshas and malady and it also protects the wife as well as the newly born child. On this stamp these defending activities are symbolized by the four tridents.
On the left there is a figure carrying two water-skins: it represents Indra, the storm god, and in his two water-skins he carries rainwater with him. In this way he drives away another evil, namely Vritra, who is the personification of drought.
But I begin the analysis of this seal with the zebu. In the Indus Valley Civilization, this cow represented Soma, a wonderful drug that is used against anything and everything.
Here is a bowl that is intended for this drink. We can conclude this because a radiant Soma drop is painted between the horns of the zebu. This cow is depicted on a striking number of bowls and in conjunction with the surrounding signs it becomes clear that in the Indus Civilization this animal embodies the Soma drug.

A zebu has also been cut out on this stamp. It is again fighting with five different human figures. Again, this is not a battle between a bull and five humans, but we will see that this is a battle of Soma against Visvavasu, Rakshas and malady. All these opponents are depicted as humanlike figures.
For example, in Khanda 23 Soma food is prepared to drive away the Rakshas:
Khanda 23
1. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the egg-plant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
And on the imprint above a Raksha is one of the five opponents the zebu is fighting with.
Rakshasa as depicted in Yakshagana, an art form of Uttara Kannada. Artist: Krishna Hasyagar, Karki
And here is a picture of such a frightening being:
Rākshasas (Sanskrit: राक्षस , romanized: rākṣasa, pronounced [raːkʂɐsɐ] ; Pali: rakkhasa; lit. 'preservers') are a race of usually malevolent beings prominently featured in Hindu mythology. They reside on Earth but possess supernatural powers, which they usually use for evil acts such as disrupting Vedic sacrifices or eating humans.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshasa



H-585
On this stamp there is again a beautiful zebu representing Soma. The trident at the top symbolizes some sort of skirmish before the husband and bride have intercourse, because by means of Soma drops, sprinkled in the bride's right nostril, Visvavasu is chased from the wedding bed:
Khanda 19
Let him pound the root of the Adhyândâ plant; and sprinkle it at the time of her monthly period with the two (verses),
Rigveda 10-85 Surya's Bridal
21 Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. I laud Visvavasu with hymns and homage. Seek in her father's home another fair one, and find the portion from of old assigned thee. 22 Rise up from hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee. Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride
This chasing away of Visvavasu is suggested by the trident.
Just to complete the story suggested on this stamp: the three vertical dashes indicate Soma that is mixed together from butter, honey, milk curds and water. This mixture is given to eat
to the new born child thrice:
Khanda 24 3. Let him mix together butter and honey, milk curds and water, or grind together rice and barley, and give it to eat (to the child) thrice from gold (i.e. from a golden vessel or with a golden spoon), 4. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the wisdom (‘veda’) raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!'(with these words) he gives him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, consisting of two syllables, or of four syllables, or also of six syllables; he should take a krit (suffix), not a taddhita.
In this way the two signs encompass the entire pregnancy period: the trident suggests that just before the intercourse Visvavasu is chased from the wedding bed with the help of Soma. The three lines suggest that after childbirth, the newborn son is fed three times with Soma food. And thus, Soma, symbolized by the zebu, is active at the beginning and after the pregnancy period.



M-931
On this stamp, in the center of the inscription is a trident carved into a womb sign. This womb sign indicates the woman, and the trident suggests that she and her embryo are protected by Soma during pregnancy, because in Khanda 21 we read that in the fourth month the man besmears the limbs of his wife with Âgya salve (a kind of Soma!) to drive away malady:
Khanda 21
1. In the fourth month (Leo) the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the embryo), (-) 3. With (the verses), verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
Rigveda 10-163 HYMN CLXIII
1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin,
Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,
From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart,
From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet,
From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails,
From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
It is clear that the inscription on the stamp show different stadia of the pregnancy period: the arrow at the beginning indicates a male embryo entering a womb, as an arrow the quiver which of course happens in the first month:
KHANDA 19.
6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months
The trident in the womb sign indicate that the woman and the embryo are protected against malady in the fourth month. And placed at the end the six-divided womb at the right suggests that Svâhâ, the wife of Agni, gives birth to the male child, naturally in the tenth month.
(Svâhâ is indicated by a six divided womb sign as she took the forms of the wives of the Saptarishis and approached Agni six times.)



H-94
On this stamp we see a man smearing his wife, who is represented by the double womb sign. In the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 this happens twice: in Khanda 19 and in Khanda 23.
By themselves the male figure suggests that a man engenders a child and the womb sign suggests that a woman gives birth to this child. So the two signs also indicate the beginning and the end of a pregnancy period.
By the way, the womb sign is similar to the last sign of these ‘symbolic abstract representations of external female genital’:
‘Six symbolic abstract representations of external female genitals which have been used in various historical/cultural contexts. Upper left: A schematized drawing of the pubic triangle; among other things, this is the earliest archaic form of the ancient Sumerian cuneiform sign MUNUS (meaning ‘woman’.)

H-38 a
Here another trident carved in a womb sign.
o Placed at the end of the inscription this womb sign suggests childbirth.
o The trident within the womb suggests that Soma provides protection during the birth
of the child by driving away the Rakshas:
Khanda 23.
1. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the egg-plant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
Soma is smeared on the womb when the woman is about to give birth of a child, so in the tenth month.
M-887 a
And here again we see a stamp on which the man smears Soma on his wife, who is indicated by the double womb sign.
Again, by themselves the male figure suggests that a man engenders a child and the womb sign suggests that a woman gives birth to this child. So the two signs also indicate the beginning and the end of the pregnancy period.



M-236
Again, placed at the end of the inscription the womb sign on the right suggests childbirth. There is something more to tell about the trident inside this womb as this ancient weapon is a symbol of the nakshatra Sravana:
23; 20 Sravana
Range: 10°00' — 23°20' Capricorn Symbol: ear, trident, row of three uneven footsteps Deity: Vishnu, Saraswati (-)
Published: en.Vedicencyclopedia.org/wiki/Nakshatra
In this shortened table, we see that an ear and a trident are the symbols of this nakshatra and Vishnu and Saraswati are its gods.
o We can recognize the symbols and the gods in Khanda 24, which describes the
ceremony for the newborn child, because in this ceremony, the father has to say three times in the right ear: 'Speech'. This right ear naturally corresponds to the first symbol for Sravana. o In the same Khanda it is also said that the child is protected by the gods, this
protection is of course symbolized by the trident. o Next, Vishnu and Saraswati are the gods of this nakshatra. Vishnu is the god of the
sun and in Khanda 24 he is employed under the name of Savitar. o And Saraswati is invoked in this Khanda as the goddess of speech;
Khanda 24 1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). (-)
4. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the wisdom (‘veda’)
raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world, N.N.!'(with these words) he gives him a name beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, consisting of two syllables, or of four syllables, or also of six syllables; he should take a krit (suffix), not a taddhita. (-) 9. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in his right ear, 'Speech!' 10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, (-)
It is obvious that there are links between the trident depicted on the stamp, the nakshatra Sravana and the text of Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 24.



M-1123 A
We return to this stamp: the humanoid figure with the two water skins represents Indra. In Khanda 19 he is said to impregnate heaven:
Khanda 19
5. Or, 'As the earth is pregnant with Agni, as the heaven is with Indra pregnant, as Vâyu dwells in the womb of the regions (of the earth), thus I place an embryo into thy womb, N.N.!'
The zebu is of course related to Taurus. At that time, the New Year began when the sun appeared in this constellation in March. And thus, the figure with the two water skins suggests that Indra brought rain in this month. This could only the case in certain areas:
https://en.allmetsat.com/climate/pakistan-afghanistan.php?code=41624
For example in Chitral, where the highest rainfall occurs in March.
https://en.allmetsat.com/climate/pakistan-afghanistan.php?code=41624
Close to Mohenjo-Daro
But not in Nawabshah, as almost all rain fall in July/August.



M-1123 A
Then the first trident indicates protection in the fourth month, as the man besmears the limbs of his wife with Âgya salve (a kind of Soma!) to drive away malady:
Khanda 21
1. In the fourth month (Leo) the Garbharakshana (i.e. the ceremony for the protection of the embryo), (-)
3. With (the verses), verse by verse besmearing her limbs with Âgya salve.
Rigveda 10-163 HYMN CLXIII
1. From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and from thy chin,
Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away. 2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the spine,
From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away. 3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart,
From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away. 4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of the feet,
From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away. 5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they nails, From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away. 6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint, From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
The second trident indicates that the man pond the roots of plants and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas:
Khanda 23.
2. Let him pound the roots of the plants kâkâtanî, makakakâtanî, kosâtakî, of the egg-plant, and of the indigo plant, and besmear (therewith) the place in which she is going to be confined, in order to drive away the Rakshas.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg



M-1123 A
The third trident indicates protection after the child is born.
Khanda 24
1. Now the Gâtakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child). (-)
4. With (the verse), 'I administer to thee honey food for the festival, the wisdom (‘veda’) raised by Savitar the bountiful; long-living, protected by the gods, live a hundred autumns in this world,
Again, this ancient weapon is also a symbol of the nakshatra Sravana:
23; 20 Sravana

Again, there is a link between the trident, Sravana and the text of Sankhayana Grihya Sutra.



M-1123 A
The fourth trident indicates the sweet honey of the cow, which protects as a father protects his son:
Khanda 25.
1. After ten days the getting up (of the mother from childbed). 2. Father and mother with washed heads, wearing (new) clothes which have not yet been washed; 3. And so also the child. 4. Let (the father) cook a mess of food in that same fire that has been kept from her confinement, 5. And let him make oblations to the Tithi of (the child's) birth and to three constellations with their (presiding) deities. 6. Let him place in the middle the oblation to that constellation under which (the child) is born; the deity, however, is constantly to precede (the corresponding Nakshatra). 7. (He then makes two other oblations with the verses,) '(May) this Agni, the excellent one, (give) thee to-day life for (our) prayers; give us life that we may live long,'—(and,) 'Life-giving, Agni, be strong by Havis; may thy face and thy seat be full of ghee; drinking ghee, the sweet honey of the cow, protect, as a father (protects) his son, here N.N.' The tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse,
Rigveda 1-91 Soma. 7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, And energy that he may live.
8. Having pronounced aloud (the child's) name, 9. And caused the Brâhmanas to say auspicious words, 10. And having sacrificed in the same way every month to the Tithi of (the child's) birth, 11. He sacrifices, when one year has expired, on the (ordinary) domestic fire.
Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 Translated by Hermann Oldenberg
And so Soma appears to be an important drug that is used before, during and after the pregnancy period to protect the woman and child against all kinds of harm.
By the way, in Khanda 25 something is also said about the Soma god himself (on the stamp he is embodied by the zebu) as he is addressed by means of a Rigveda verse as a god who keeps the law, both old and young, who gives happiness, and energy that he may live.



Seal Ur (Upenn; U.16747); dia. 2.6, ht. 0.9 cm.; Parpola, 1994, p. 183;
We now look at an imprint of a stamp found in Ur: here we see a figure carrying two water skins:
‘water carrier with a skin (or pot?) hung on each end of the yoke across his shoulders and another
one below the crook of his left arm; the vessel on the right end of his yoke is over a receptacle for the water; a star on either side of the head’.
http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.com/2020/11/an-innovation-in-indus-script-writing.html
Here we see two images of men using water skins.
H-374
And this part of a broken plate found in the Indus Valley shows the Indus variant of the figure carrying two water skins.



K-20 a
In hymn Rigveda 5-83 a prayer ask Parjanya to open his water-skin and to draw it downwards to saturate both the earth and heaven with fatness:
‘Thunder and roar: the germ of life deposit. Fly round us on thy chariot water laden. Thine opened water-skin draw with thee downward, and let the hollows and the heights be level. Lift up the mighty vessel, pour down water, and let the liberated streams rush forward. Saturate both the earth and Heaven with fatness,’
Parjanya can be translated as: Rain-cloud, thunder cloud or a cloud in general:
‘According to the 1965 Sanskrit-English dictionary by Shri Vaman Shivram Apte Parjanya, (parjánya) means: Rain-cloud, thunder cloud, a cloud in general. It also means rain (as referred in the Shloka from Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3 Verse 14) and the god (deva) of rain i.e. Indra.’
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parjanya
M-1089 a
It appears that Indra is linked to Parjanya, as the storm god is rich in rain:
Rigveda 8-6 Indra
1. Indra, great in his power and might, and like Parjanya rich in rain,
In the Rigveda India is usually called ‘a bull’ and he also has to drink the Soma juice. So, the drinking bull below suggests that the figure wearing two water skins indicates Indra bringing rain.



H-81
There is also a text in the Rigveda telling that Indra pours forth a hide that holds the rain: this hide will obviously be similar to the water skin:
Rigveda 1-129 Indra
1. The car which Indra, thou, for service of the Gods though it be far away, O swift One, bringest near, which, Blameless One, thou bringest near, Place swiftly nigh us for our help: be it thy will that it be strong. Blameless and active, hear this speech of orderers, this speech of us like orderers. 2 Hear, Indra, thou whom men in every fight must call to show thy strength, for cry of battle with the men, with men of war for victory. He who with heroes wins the light, who with the singers gains the prize, Him the rich seek to gain even as a swift strong steed, even as a courser fleet and strong.
3 Thou, Mighty, pourest forth the hide that holds the rain, thou keepest far away, Hero, the wicked man, thou shuttest out the wicked man. Indra, to thee I sing, to Dyaus, to Rudra glorious in himself, To Mitra, Varuna I sing a far-famed hymn to the kind God a far-famed hymn.
In the same Rigveda hymn we read that Indra is pacified with holy food and praises: and below we see that the storm-god, depicted as a bull, is indeed eating.
7 By thoughtful invocation this may we obtain, obtain great wealth, O Wealthy One, with Hero sons, wealth that is sweet with hero sons.
Him who is wroth we pacify with sacred food and eulogies,
Indra the Holy with our calls inspired and true, the Holy One with calls inspired.
To complete the story suggested in the inscription we also have to write something about the three dashes. They will no doubt suggest that the father says three times in the right ear: ‘Speech!’.
Khanda 24
9. The production of intelligence (is performed) by thrice saying in his right ear, 'Speech!'
10. And let him recite over (the child the following text), 'Speech, the goddess, (Sarasvatī) united with mind, together with breath, the child, uttered by Indra—may she rejoice in thee, the goddess, for the sake of joy, the great one, the sweet sounding, the music, full of music, the flowing, self-produced.'
Because it is clear that in this speaking Indra is involved.



M-1880 a
This is another stamp on which Indra is eating like a bull from a trough. The figure with the water-skins suggests that the storm god brings rain. The last character of the inscription is a diamond, which suggests that a child is being born. All these events are mentioned in Rigveda hymn 1-54.
First, Indra is a bull, who drinks the Soma:
Rigveda 1-54 Indra (-) Who with his daring might, a Bull exceeding strong in strength, maketh him master of the heaven and earth. (-) 8 His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their work, be some who drink the Soma, (-) 10 There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters' flow: in Vrtra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed. But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivities. 11 So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people.
Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring.
Then he is the god who vouchsafe wealth and food with noble offspring. The food is suggested by the two dashes on top, and noble offspring is suggested by the diamond:
http;//en.finaly.org/index.php/The earliest precursor of writing
Here you can see that a diamond can symbolize a womb and womb signs placed at the end of the inscription suggest childbirth. At last, the second figure represents Vrtra, the god of drought, being defeated by Indra:
Rigveda 1-32 Indra
7 Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders. Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus Vrtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered.



M-1885 a
Like so many gods, Parjanya, the god of the rain cloud, is also referred to as a bull in Rigveda 5-83. In the same hymn, he opens the water-skin to saturate both the earth and heaven with fatness:
Rigveda 5-83 Parjanya
1. Sing with these songs thy welcome to the Mighty, with adoration praise and call Parjanya. The Bull, loud roaring, swift to send his bounty, lays in the plants the seed. for germination. 2 He smites the trees apart; he slays the demons: all life fears him who wields the mighty weapon. From him exceeding strong fices e'en the guiltless, when thundering Parjanya smites the wicked. 3 Like a car-driver whipping on his horses, he makes the messengers of rain spring forward. Far off resounds the roaring of the lion, what time Parjanya fills the sky with rain-cloud. 4 Forth burst the winds, down come the lightning-flashes: the plants shoot up, the realm of light is streaming. Food springs abundant for all living creatures, what time Parjanya quickens earth with moisture. 5 Thou at whose bidding earth bows low before thee, at whose command hoofed cattle fly in terror, At whose behest the plants assume all colours, even thou Parjanya, yield us great protection. 6 Send down for us the rain of heaven, ye Maruts, and let the Stallion's flood descend in torrents. Come hither with this thunder while thou pourest the waters down, our heavenly Lord and Father. 7 Thunder and roar: the germ of life deposit. Fly round us on thy chariot water laden.
Thine opened water-skin draw with thee downward, and let the hollows and the heights be level. 8 Lift up the mighty vessel, pour down water, and let the liberated streams rush forward. Saturate both the earth and heaven with fatness, and for the cows let there be drink abundant. 9 When thou, with thunder and with roar, Parjanya, smitest sinners down, This universe exults thereat, yea, all that is upon the earth. 10 Thou hast poured down the rain-flood now withhold it. Thou hast made desert places fit for travel. Thou hast made herbs to grow for our enjoyment: yea, thou hast won thee praise from living creatures.
Besides that, he is also asked for enough drink for the cows, this means that the bull below could also embodies Parjanya.



M-282
Today, Airavata is Indra’s mount: Airavata (Sanskrit: ऐरावत‘belonging to Iravati’) is a divine elephant, characterized by four tusks, seven trunks and a white complexion.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airavata
But in the Indus Valley Civilization and elephant embodies Indra himself. So on this stamp Indra is the acting god, and therefore it can be said that the figure wearing two water skins symbolizes that the storm god carries water and thus brings rain to the Indus Valley.
M-1928 a
Besides that, according to the following Rigveda hymn, Soma, (embodied by the zebu below) is such a powerful god that he is able to bring forth rain: in Rigveda hymn 9-74 he is a Steer of the kine who commands the rain:
Rigveda 9-74 Soma Pavamana
3 Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blend with Soma juice;
He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.
This means that on the stamp the zebu below demonstrates that here Soma is the acting god and that he carries the two water-skins to bring the rain to the Indus Valley.



M-1901
This stamp shows two humanoid figures, both carrying two water bags. These two figures suggest that there are two rainy periods in the place where this stamp was made and used. The following graph shows that in Dera Ismail Khan there are indeed two rainy periods, the first around March and the second in July and August:
https://en.allmetsat.com/climate/pakistan-afghanistan.php?code=41624
The stamp above depicts a zebu, which indicate that on this stamp Soma is regarded to be the acting god: we must take this into account when we want to interpret the inscription. According to the next hymn this food or drink pours rain, it is a steer, a warrior, destroys enemies and bestows food and progeny. Some of these activities are indicated on the stamp:
Rigveda 9-65 Soma Pavamana Pour on us, Pavamana, rain, as service and rain praise for Gods: Pour all to be our nourishment. Thou art a Steer by lustre: we, O Pavamana, faithfully Call upon thee the Splendid One. Do thou, rejoicing, nobly-armed! pour upon us heroic strength: I send thee forth to battle from the press, O Pavamana, Strong, Sustainer, looker on the light. Acknowledged by this song of mine, flow, tawny-coloured, with thy stream Incite to battle thine ally. O Indu, visible to all pour out for us abundant food:
Soma, be thou our prosperer, destroyer of our enemies. Soma , bestowing food upon our progeny, from every sides, Pour on us riches thousandfold

And the remarkable thing is that the following hymn shows that also the river Sindhu can be likened to rainfall and a bull:
Rigveda 10-75 The Rivers
1. The singer, O ye Waters in Vivasvan's place, shall tell your grandeur forth that is beyond compare. The Rivers have come forward triply, seven and seven. Sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flow. 2 Varuna cut the channels for thy forward course, O Sindhu, when thou rannest on to win the race. Thou speedest o'er precipitous ridges of the earth, when thou art Lord and Leader of these moving floods. 3 His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth: he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light.
Like floods of rain that fall- in thunder from the cloud, so Sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull. 4 Like mothers to their calves, like milch kine with their milk, so, Sindhu, unto thee the roaring rivers run. Thou leadest as a warrior king thine army's wings what time thou comest in the van of these swiftstreams. 5 Favour ye this my laud, O Ganga, Yamuna, O Sutudri, Parusni and Sarasvati: With Asikni, Vitasta, O Marudvrdha, O Arjikiya with Susoma hear my call. 6 First with Trstama thou art eager to flow forth, with Rasa, and Susartu, and with Svetya here, With Kubha; and with these, Sindhu and Mehatnu, thou seekest in thy course Krumu and Gomati. 7 Flashing and whitely-gleaming in her mightiness, she moves along her ample volumes through the realms, Most active of the active, Sindhu unrestrained, like to a dappled mare, beautiful, fair to see. 8 Rich in good steeds is Sindhu, rich in cars and robes, rich in gold, nobly-fashioned, rich in ample wealth. Blest Silamavati and young Urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets. 9 Sindhu hath yoked her car, light-rolling, drawn by steeds, and with that car shall she win booty in this fight. So have I praised its power, mighty and unrestrained, of independent glory, roaring as it runs.
Therefore, because of the meandering lines and the two fish, one could also conclude that the bull below represents Shindu.

I am ending this essay with this stamp that I have already written something about. We saw that in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra Khanda 19-25 five times all kinds of evil are chased away by means of Soma, which is symbolized by the zebu that has thrown five figures upwards. But the arrow suggests the onset of pregnancy:
KHANDA 19. 6. Or, 'May a male embryo enter thy womb, as an arrow the quiver; may a man be born here, a son after ten months.
And the little dash under the head of the zebu will be linked to Soma and it will undoubtedly suggest that in the Sankhayana Grihya Sutra a Rigveda hymn is quoted that tells something about this god:
KHANDA 25.
The tenth oblation of the mess of cooked food with the verse:
Rigveda 1-91 Soma.
7 To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, And energy that he may live.
In this way we again see the usual pattern: the zebu (Soma) fights with five opponents, covering the period before, during and after pregnancy The arrow marks the beginning of pregnancy and the small dash marks the post-pregnancy period.
