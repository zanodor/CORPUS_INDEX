1. Foreword
This “Etymological Dictionary of Hungarian” – for which I propose the abbreviation “EDH” – is based on the assumption that the Hungarian (Magyar) language is the direct successor of Sumerian. With this assumption – for which the present author is convinced that there is enough evidence (cf. Chapters 2 and 3) -, EDH strongly competes with and contradicts the traditional Hungarian etymological dictionaries, that are based on the assumption that Hungarian belongs to the Finno-Ugric (FU) languages:
● Budenz, József Magyar-ugor összehasonlító szótár Budapest 1873-1881 New impression with an introduction by Gyula Décsy under the title: A Comparative Dictionary of the Finno-Ugric Elements in the Hungarian Vocabulary Bloomington, IN 1966
● Szarvas, Gábor Magyar nyelvtörténeti szótár a legrégibb nyelvemlékről a nyelvújításig (3 vols.) Budapest 1890-1893
● Gombocz, Zoltán/Melich, János Magyar etymológiai szótár (incomplete) Budapest 1914-1930.
● Bárczi, Géza Magyar szófejtő szótár Budapest 1941 New impression Budapest 1994
● Benkő, Loránd et al. A magyar nyelv történeti-etimológiai szótára (4 vols.) Budapest 1967-1984
● Lakó, György et al. A magyar szókészlet finnugor elemei etimológiai szótára (3 vols.) Budapest 1968-1978
● Benkó, Loránd et al. Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen (3 vols.) Budapest 1993-1997
Obviously, each 10 or 20 years, there was a need for a new (and expensive) multi-volumes etymological dictionary of Hungarian, that is very singular, since it happened in no other known language.

Furthermore, if one compares the “crucial words” – alleged borrowings from Slavonic or Turkic and words of “unknown” or “doubtful origin” -, one will find, as a rule, in each of the fore-mentioned dictionaries quite different etymologies (cf. Chapter 4).
All these dictionaries are ordered alphabetically according to the Hungarian lemma and none of these books are written in English. EDH, however, differs in two ways from the already published etymological dictionaries of Hungarian: Firstly, it is written in English that is more widespread than Hungarian or German. Secondly, EDH is also ordered alphabetically according to the Hungarian lemma, but separately for each language or language family: Sumerian and Hungarian (Chapter 5), Hungarian and the other Finno-Ugric languages (Chapter 6), Caucasian and Hungarian (Chapter 7), Bantu and Hungarian (Chapter 8), Etruscan and Hungarian (Chapter 9), Tibeto-Burman and Hungarian (Chapter 10), Munda languages (Chapter 11), Dravidian languages and Hungarian (Chapter 12), Chinese and Hungarian (Chapter 13), Japanese and Hungarian (Chapter 14), Turkish and Hungarian (Chapter 15), Austronesian and Hungarian (16), Mayan Languages and Hungarian (Chapter 17).
A chapter about conclusions (Chapter 18) and two indices (Chapters 19 and 20) conclude EDH.
The fundament of all comparisons between Hungarian and Sumerian is the complete list, given in Chapter 5, from Colman-Gabriel Gostony’s “Dictionnarie d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975), a milestone for Sumerian-Hungarian research. This means: We do not take as a basis a regular Hungarian dictionary and compare all or some of its words with the words in a dictionary of another language, disregarding sound-laws and operating on kling-klang-etymologies. We set as only fact the hypothesis, that the 1042 etymologies in Gostony (1975) are correct, since they have never been disproved. In other words: We reduce the many then-thousands of Hungarian words of the following three best dictionaries:
● Czuczor, Gergely/Fogarasi, János A magyar nyelv szótára (6 vols) Pest 1862-1874 Available on CD Rom from Arcanum Adabázis Kft., Budapest (arcadat@axelero.hu)
● Ballagi, Mór A magyar nyelv teljes szótára (2 vols. in 1) Budapest 1873 New impression Budapest 1998
● Halász, Előd/Földes, Csaba/Uzony, Pál Magyar-német nagyszótár – Ungarisch-deutsches Grosswörterbuch Budapest 1998
to a relative small common Sumerian-Hungarian basis of 1042 entries and compare this list with the already mentioned languages: A word from another languages enters the list only, if it corresponds with one of the 1042 words and no other Hungarian word than one of these 1042 will be compared to another language, even if they are plenty of examples to be found in the extremely rich SumerianHungarian literature (cf. Chapter 2). The only exception is Etruscan (cf. Chapter 9), being a corpus-language with an extremely restricted vocabulary. Of course, comparing three instead of two

languages also reduces massively the chance of mistaken etymologies. For the sound rules I refer to Gostony (1975) concerning the Sumerian-Hungarian part and to the dictionaries of the other languages, from which we have taken our data, for the other parts, but I do not repeat the sound-rules here neither do the FU dictionaries. Yet, almost all of the works used in EDH can be found in a big university library in America and in Europa or borrowed via interloan.
All the maps that are used in this book are copyrighted by Wikipedia.
The author hopes that EDH will be able to establish itself as a reference work for all the peoples who have always adhered to the Sumerian-Hungarian theory or do not believe anymore in FU and Uralic linguistics. If EDH will cause some adherents of FU/Uralic linguistics to convert to SumerianHungarian linguistics, then it has reached more than its author ever could hope.
Finally, I give EDH two sad, but true quotations by two of the greatest Sumerian-Hungarian researchers on its way:
Spread the word and be not surprised if you are assailed, perhaps even by people who call themselves Hungarians.
(Ida Bobula, Budapest 1900 – Gaffney, SC, USA, 1981)
Mert nem az az igaz, ami igaz, hanem amit a világ igaznak – tart.
(Because not that is true, what is true, but what the world – holds for true.)
(Viktor Padány, Vatta (Borsod) 1906 – Melbourne, Australia 1963)

2. Introduction into
Sumerian-Hungarian research
1. Preliminary remarks
Sumerian-Hungarian research has at least four drawbacks: First, there is – unlike in Finno-Ugristics and Uralistics - no complete bibliography of Sumerian-Hungarian studies, although the literature is enormous. Second, because during the communist era Sumerian-Hungarian research was forbidden in Hungary, many publications had to appear abroad in more or less ephemeral journals and obscure publishing houses. Third, the majority of these publications – again unlike FU- and Uralistic studies are written in Hungarian, so they are not understandable for most non-Hungarians. Fourth, there are not only pearls amongst the Sumerian-Hungarian studies. Especially in linguistics, many works have been written by non-linguists, even by non-academics. Therefore, this introduction has also the purpose of leading the beginner to the scientifically valuable publications.
2. History of Sumerian-Hungarian research
The standard work that gives an overview of the beginnings of Sumerian-Hungarian research is:
● Érdy, Miklós The Sumerian, Ural-Altaic, Magyar Relationship: A History of Research A sumír, ural-altaji, magyar rokonság története Part I : The 19th Century I. Rész: A 19. század New York 1974
This work has the advantage, that it is bilingual (Hungarian and English), but the disadvantage, that Part II (concerning the 20th century) never appeared. A relatively short, but reliable “substitute” for Part II with a long bibliography is the following article:
● Dombi, Charles (Károly) The controversy on the origins and early history of the Hungarians In: www.hunmgyar.org/tor/controve.htm
Here we learn the names of the decipherers of Sumerian who also connected it immediately to the “Turanian” languages (the former name of the “Ural-Altaic” family), especially Hungarian: Edward Hincks (1792-1866), François Lenormant (1837-1883), Jules Oppert (1825-1905) and Henry C. Rawlinson (1792-1866). The decipherment of the Cuneiform writing, in which the two basic languages of ancient Mesopotamia, Sumerian and Akkadian, were written between ca. 3000 – 400 B.C., was started by Georg Friedrich Grotefend as early as in 1802, but only in 1850, Rawlinson finished it.

Therefore, before 1850, there is also no Sumerian-Hungarian research. But since (as we will see in chapter 3), there are many Akkadian loanwords in Sumerian, one should never forget the following work whose aim was to prove that Hungarian is related to the Semitic languages:
● Kiss, Bálint Magyar régiségek (Hungarian Antiquities) Pest 1839
Hence, it is true, that the Finno-Ugric theory, initiated by János Sajnovics (1770) and Sámuel Gyarmathi (1799) is older and competed with the still older theory of the Turkish origin of Hungarian, but it is mistaken to speak about the so-called “second Hungarian-Turkish war” (“ a második Magyar-Török háború”) after 1850. The connections established between the newly detected Sumerian and the Hungarian language that were most strongly propagated by two non-Hungarians, the French archeologist Lenormant and the German linguist Fritz Hommel (1854-1936), both university professors, spread quickly all over the world and found their entrance f. ex. also in some editions of the “Encyclopaedia Britannica” between 1860 and 1880.
But things changed: Already during the so-called Bach-era 1848-1859, but at last since the HungarianAustrian “Ausgleich” in 1867, the Habsburgs ordered Austrian and German professors for the chairs in linguistics and history to Budapest. One of them was the German Josef Budenz who published on behalf of the Viennese court between 1873 and 1881 his “Magyar-ugor összehasonlító szótár” (“Comparative Hungarian-Ugric Dictionary”), where the long forgotten hypothesis of Sajnovics and Gyarmathi was freshened up again. It is obvious, what the Habsburgs wanted to show: The Hungarians, who were not more than slaves in the eyes of the Habsburgs, were not allowed to trace their origins back to the Sumerians, the first high culture that existed on earth. Rather, a connection with the Lapps, the Voguls and the Ostyaks, who lived in the 19th century still in the stone-Age, was established. Political propaganda and banishment of the adherents of the Sumerian-Hungarian theory helped a lot. After the downfall of the Austrian-Hungarian double-monarchy in 1918, the communists took over Hungary already in 1919 under the leadership of Béla Kún, then extensively in 1945 and from 1956-1989, so that the communists directly continued the Anti-Sumerian-Hungarian campaign started by their enemies, the Habsburgs, since in the end, both the Habsburgs and the communists agreed in their opinion that the Hungarians are subhuman creatures.
Nowadays, Finno-Ugristics is fully established, all Sumerian-Hungarian research is considered to be “unscientific”, representatives of this theory are blacklisted, publishing in Hungary is possible, but still difficult, because the communists are still sitting on key positions in all sectors of education (and elsewhere). Yet, there is hope, since the chairs of the FU representatives started to shake already a couple of years ago. The Tartu school of Uralistics has given up since a long time the concept of the Uralic tree-model and thus the genetic relationship of the Uralic languages:
● Künnap, Ago Breakthrough in Present-Day Uralistics Tartu 1998
Angela Marcantonio has proven, that there is no FU language family either:

● Marcantonio, Angela The Uralic language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics Oxford 2002
László Marácz, like the two fore-mentioned scholars a university professor, has shown both in Hungarian and in English, that in reality not the Sumerian-Hungarian, but the FU theory is unscientific:
● Marácz, László A finnugor elmélet tarthatatlansága nyelvészeti szempontból (Original of the following English translation) In: www.kitalaltkozepkor.hu/maracz_finnugor.html
● Marácz, László The untenability of the Finno-Ugrian theory from a linguistic point of view In: www.acronet.net/~magyar/english/1997-3/JRNL97B.htm
Marácz has shown, that the FU theory is circular and thus unscientific: One proves, what one already presupposes to have been proven. E.g. one compares only languages of the Finno-Ugric family in order to “prove” that these languages belong to the Finno-Ugric family. Otherwise, no Finno-Ugrist could refuse comparisons of Hungarian with Sumerian, Turkish, Japanese, etc. When the mathematician Bertrand Russell proved Gottlob Frege in the end of the 19th century, that in his logic there is circularity – the so-called Russell-paradox of a set of sets that either contains or does not contain itself -, then this result had devastating consequences for mathematics, since mathematics was based since Cantor on logic. Russell’s paradox thus did not only split set theory in two different set theories, but changed the very fundament of mathematics (cf. e.g. the Bourbaki School). But nothing like that happened until now in Finno-Ugristics. Even if circularity can be shown to a kindergarten child – for example with Epimenides’ paradox: “I am lying” -, the vast majority of Finno-Ugrists do not show any understanding.
Marácz showed also a real alternative to comparative historical reconstruction: the so-called “wordbushes” or “clusters”: One puts together words with identical or similar form and content and orders them into bushes. This pure synchronic procedure is non-circular, because in an agglutinative language like Hungarian there are no such phenomena like ablaut that involve previous diachronic knowledge in synchronic analysis. One should not forget, either, that the method of historical reconstruction was adopted from the Indo-European languages and successfully applied to the Semitic languages - because both of them have ablaut, but it has not proven to be valuable for any other language family. Moreover, in isolating languages like Chinese and the almost whole range of Austronesian languages between Madagascar in the West and Easter Island in the East, one has no other possibility to decide, if two or more words are genetically related or not, since in these languages we have to deal with monosyllabic roots (and not to speak about the total absence of older texts in most of the latter languages). Here, too, Marácz’s method applies: If a certain word is a member of a word-bush, then all the words, that belong to this bush are genetically related to one another, but if it stays alone, then it must be a borrowing. These bushes can be taken easily from the huge Hungarian dictionary by Czuczor and Fogarasi:

3. How Hungarian history looks like from the Sumerian-Hungarian point of view
The best and most exhaustive work on general Hungarian history (including linguistics, too) is:
● Götz, László Keleten kél a nap (The Sun Rises in the East). 2 vols. Budapest 1994 Original typewriter copy in 4 vols.: Altötting and Vienna 1981-84
An extremely well written and compact introduction into all aspects of Sumerian-Hungarian history (including linguistics, folklore and anthropology) gives:
● Bobula, Ida Origin of the Hungarian Nation Gainesville, FL 1966
This little book, that has only 68 pages (and for which one has to pay astronomical prices in antique book stores) is an abridged version of one of the three of the author’s more extensive PhD Dissertations:
● Bobula, Ida Sumerian Affiliations Washington, D.C. 1951,
but unfortunately, this book has never been printed but only distributed in photocopies. (The Louis Szathmáry collection of the University of Chicago, who has the best collection of Sumerian-Hungarian studies throughout the US, has a copy, that can be borrowed.) But this book was revised and translated in Spanish:
● Bobula, Ida Herencia de Sumeria Mexico City 1967
and gives also many valuable maps about the early wanderings of the Sumerians into the Carpathian basin.
Amongst the other books of the same author, the following posthumous collection of minor writings is important:

Especially interesting for place and proper names are the two following works:
● Bobula, Ida Kétezer magyar név sumir eredete (Ten thousand Hungarian names of Sumerian Origin) Montreal 1970
● Novotny, Elemér A sumer és a magyar alapszókincs egyezése (Comparison of the Sumerian and the Hungarian basic vocabularies) Budapest 1985 (A privately bound big collection of photocopied typewritten essays that exist only in 1 copy in the US: in the University of Chicago Library under the calling number PH2074.N686 1985.)
To use only with care are all works by Jós Ferenc Badiny (also known as Francisco Badiny Jos and Francisco Jos Badiny). The best and only one written in a sort of English is:
● Badiny, Francisco Jos The Sumerian Wonder. With the collaboration of M. Brady, M. von Haynal, G. Enderlin and Dr. E. Novotny Buenos Aires 1974
Characteristic of all of the many books and articles by Badiny is, that he presupposes a continuity between Sumerian and Hungarian, i.e. according to him and his followers, Sumerian never died out, and today’s Hungarian is thus nothing but a late form of Sumerian.
In the following, we will present an outline of the main points of Sumerian-Hungarian history from the following article by Charles Dombi. (All quotations from Dombi, whose article is not paginated, are marked; what is not marked, is by me, especially the passage about the Transilvanian origin of the Sumerians: Dombi assumes that the Sumerians are autochthonous in Mesopotamia and wandered from there to Transilvania):
● Dombi, Charles (Károly) Hungarian historical chronology In: www.hunmagyar.org/tor/mythist.htm
The Hungarians trace their origin back to Nimrod, who lives in the Hungarian mythology as MénMarót (pseudo-etymologically influenced by Hung. mén “stallion”). He as his wife Eneth had two sons, Magor and Hunor, who became the forefathers of the Magyars (Hungarians) and the Huns. The standard works for Hungarian mythology are:
● Kandra, Kabos Magyar mythologia (Hungarian mythology) Eger 1897, new impression San Francisco 1978

“Byzantine sources mention that the Magyars were also known as the Sabirs who originated from Northern Mesopotamia, which was referred to as Subir-ki by the Sumerians who also originated from this land. Numerous other ancient and medieval sources also refer to the Scythians, Huns, Avars and Magyars as identical people. Independently from the various political regimes which have ruled over Hungary and which have imposed the current official version of the origins and history of the Hungarians, modern scientific and scholarly research has confirmed the Sumerian-Scythian-Hun-AvarMagyar ethnolinguistic relationship and continuity”.
The following map shows the antique Mesopotamia. The Sabirs came perhaps from the Zagros Mountains:
The standard work for the antique and medieval testimonies of the peoples mentioned is:

5500 B.C. The Proto-Sumerians wander from Transylvania, where the age of the clay tablets of Tatárlaka has been testified by C14 analysis, towards Mesopotamia, where they start the Copper Age. Since Hungary is rich in copper, the Proto-Sumerian metallurgists may have brought their technical knowledge from their homeland into Mesopotamia. These Proto-Sumerians may be considered already as Hungarians, since their writing, that is identical with early Sumerian pictographic writing found in the cultures of Uruk-Warka IV- (ca. 3500-3200 v. Chr.) and Jemdet-Nasr (ca. 3100-2900 v. Chr.), corresponds to the Székely runes (Hung. rovásírás, literally “carve-writing”, from Hung. róni “to carve” and from here English rune, German Rune).
The standard works to these topics are:

● Torma, Zsófia Ethnographische Analogien (Ethnographic analogies) Jena 1894

3000 B.C. “Sumerian colonies are established from the Atlantic Ocean through the Mediterranean and Danubian basins to India and Central Asia (Turan), and from the Caucasus to Northeast Africa. The vast belt of Eurasian grasslands stretching from the Carpathian mountains to the Altai range, bordered in the North by the Eurasian forest belt and in the South by the Caucasus and Iranian plateau, is gradually settled by Sumerians and Sumerian-related people from Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia and Iran. These Near Eastern settlers became the peoples which were later referred to as the Scythians, Huns, Avars and Magyars among others”. The Carpathian basin was reached by the Scythians in the 6th century B.C., the Huns in the 5th century A.D., the Avars in the 6th century A.D. and by the Magyars in the 9th century B.C.
“First appearance of nomadic Semitic tribes in Sumerian Mesopotamia. Semitic people begin to settle in increasing numbers in Mesopotamia. The Sumerian civilization exerts a dominant influence upon the development of later Semitic cultures”.

2455 B.C. “The Semitic Akkadians impose their hegemony upon the Sumerian city-states. Mesopotamia is devastated by wars, the population is decimated, oppressed and enslaved by the Akkadians. Many Sumerians flee to their colonies”.
1900 B.C “The Semitic Babylonians impose their hegemony upon Mesopotamia”.
1115 B.C. “The Semitic Assyrians impose their hegemony over the Near East after centuries of warfare. The ensuing devastation, decimation, deportations and oppression alter the ethnic composition of the Near East, including Mesopotamia, as the Semitic element increases and the Sumerians decrease”.
612 B.C. “The Sumerian-related Chaldeans, Medes and Scythians annihilate the Assyrian empire. The Scythians dominate the vast Eurasian grasslands from the Carpathian basin to the Altai during centuries”
539 B.C. “After overthrowing the Median Empire, the Persians conquer Mesopotamia and the rest of the Near East”.
256 B.C. “After the fall of Persia, the Parthian Empire rules over Mesopotamia, Armenia and Iran. The Turanian Parthians, custodians of the ancient Sumerian civilization, resist the Eastern expansion of the Roman Empire. In 226 A.D., the Persian Sassanids overthrow the Parthian Empire which experiences a revival between 272 and 326 A.D.
2nd c. A.D. “The Hun empire reaches its greatest extent from the Pacific to the Aral sea, from Siberia to the Partian Empire and China. The Huns face centuries of struggle against an increasingly offensive and encroaching Chinese imperialism and expanionism. Facing mounting pressures from China in the East, the Huns begin the expand into Europe. In the 4th century A.D., the Huns begin their Western military campaigns, In 375 A.D., the Huns defeat the Goths, setting in motion the great migration of Germanic tribes which also contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire”.
5th c. “The Huns continue their crushing military campaigns against the Roman Empire. The Huns expel the Romans from the Carpathian basin (Pannonia and Dacia were occupied by the Romans after they had perpetrated genocidal warfare against the indigenous inhabitants of these Carpathian regions) and the Hun empire establishes its center of power in the Carpathian-Danubian region. Following Atilla’s death under suspicious circumstances in 453, the Hun’s Germanic allies turn against them and the bulk of the Hunnic tribes regroups to the East of the Carpathians, leaving a rear-guard tribe in the Eastern Carpathians. This Hunnic tribe still inhabits this region today and they are the Hungarian Székely people”.
562 “The Avar-Huns establish their empire in Central and Eastern Europe, with the Carpathian basin as the center of power. The Avars continue their centuries-long struggle against the encroaching German and Byzantine empires”.

9th c. “Following the settlements of Jewish refugees from the Near East in the Khazar empire, the ruling dynasty of the Khazars, another Turanian people, is converted to Judaism and seeks to impose this religion upon all its subjects. This precipitates a civil war which leads to the collapse of the Khazar empire. Several rebel Khazar tribes join the Hungarian federation which was led by the Magyar tribe. At that time the Hungarians were established in their own independent state of Dentumagyaria, between the Avar and Khazar empires”.
859-96 “After the collapse of the Khazar Empire, the Magyars and the other Hungarian tribes move West into the Etelköz region, where the Covenant of Blood takes place. This Covenant effectively creates the Magyar (Hungarian) nation which proceeds with the reconquest of the Carpathian basin and its surrounding regions. After expelling foreign encroaching powers from the Carpathian region and uniting with their previously settled Hun-Avar ethnic kin, the Magyars establish the Hungarian state in 896 as the successor state to the Hun and Avar empires”.
After around 3000 B.C., the Akkadians started to torment the Sumerians, which leaded them to emigration, but only a part of them became the later Scythians, Huns, Avars, Parthians and Magyars. As will be shown in this book, a relatively big part of the Sumerians wandered not to the North, but to the South, they spread out all over Tibet, India, China, Japan, etc. and as far as to the South Sea, where they left their traces in the languages and cultures of the Oceanian people. That part of the Sumerians, however, who took the way North via Caucasus into the Carpathian basin must have met on its way one ore more aboriginal peoples, who may have joined the later Hungarians before they separated and spread out as far as to the later Finland, Estonia and Lappland: They became what is mistakenly called today the “Finno-Ugrians”, and the small common stock of cognates (cf. chapters 3 and 4) may find its explication by borrowing from the Sumerian-Hungarians.

3. Is there a Finno-Ugric or Uralic
language family?
Even in traditional Finno-Ugric or Uralic departments, the existence of a Finno-Ugric or Uralic language family has been doubted for a couple of years. But while more and more scholars are convinced, that the former Uralic language family is nothing but a Sprachbund, most Finno-Ugrists defend their position as representatives of a language family.
In this chapter, using the 100 words Swadesh-list and considering 10 Finno-Ugric and 2 Samoyed languages, it will be shown that neither the one nor the other assumption is justified. The politically motivated construction of a Finno-Ugric language family in the 18th century shows such a small basis of common words that would put back Proto-Finno-Ugric or Proto-Uralic long before 10’000 B.C. and therefore leads itself ad absurdum. On the other side, it will be shown that the theory of the Sumerian origin of Hungarian, commonly accepted before the invention of the Finno-Ugric and Uralic language families (cf. Érdy 1974), is acceptable also from a language-statistical point.
The 12 Uralic as well as the Sumerian and Akkadian Swadesh lists were compiled from dictionaries (cf. the bibliography, Chapter 19). Unfortunately, the Ostyak dictionary of Karjalainen (1948) and the Mordwin dictionary of Paasonen (1990-96) were not available to me, because the Library of Congress does not borrow reference works. From the living languages only the Finnic and Estonian lists could be controlled by native speakers in the spring of 2003 in the Institute of Uralistics of the University of Szombathely (Hungary). The Hungarian list was compiled by the present author according to his native speaker’s proficiency.
Since, as it is known, the Swadesh list was and is still discussed controversely, I would like to mention here only a few recent cases, in which the list could be applied successfully, i.e. where the calculations that follow from the list are matching with the chronological data of non-statistical linguistics: Elbert (1953) for Polynesian languages; Rabin (1975) for Semitic languages, Blažek for Sumerian (including Emesal), Akkadian, Elamitic, Kassitic, Hurrian, Urartian and Hattic; Forster, Tóth and Bandelt (1998) for 17 Retoromance/Ladinic dialects and recently Forster and Tóth (2003) for Celtic languages.

The evaluation of the three Swadesh lists results in the following percentages:
Hungarian = Sumerian: 91%
Hungarian = Akkadian: 27% (2%)
These indications that are on the first sight contradictory, have to been understood as follows: From the 27 words, that Hungarian shares with Akkadian, 25% are to be considered either as Sumerian borrowings in Akkadian or as Akkadian borrowings in Sumerian. For 2 Hungarian words there is not (yet?) a Sumerian etymology. To say it in other words: 93% of the Swadesh list has a Mesopotamian etymology – while, as one remembers, Proto-Uralic has only 24.54% and Proto-Finno-Ugrian-Uralic even only 23.33% common words.
The extremely high percentage of 27% Akkadian-Semitic words in Hungarian goes along with an observation by Ida Bobula: „I am convinced that the Hungarian language bears the stamp of not an early, but of a very late stage of Sumerian culture. This is shown by the quantity of Semitic cultural loanwords in Hungarian; from Akkadian and Babylonian“ (Bobula 1996, p. 51; cf. also Bobula 1951, p. 11, note 3). Gostony, too, who did not work with the Swadesh list either, but etymologized all available Hungarian words, came to the conclusions that from the (according to his counting) 1050 words in his Sumerian etymological dictionary 923 are shared with Hungarian words, this are 87.9% (cf. also Oláh 1980, p. 12). These results show firstly a pretty exact correspondence between two methodically fully different approaches and secondly their independency of the Swadesh list.
Aside from that, Gostony has shown that Hungarian and Sumerian correspond in 51 of 53 grammatical phonetical, morphological and syntactical) features (Gostony 1975, pp. 175ss., esp. 194ss.). The correspondances between Hungarian and the „Turanian“ and „Non-Turanian“ languages are according to Gostony (1975, pp. 201s.): Hungarian: 51; Turk languages: 29; Caucasian languages: 24, northern Finno-Ugric languages: 21; Tibeto-Burmanic languages: 12; Munda-Khol languages: 9; Paleo-Sibirian languages: 8; Oceanic languages: 7; Akkadian: 5; Sanskrit: 5; Dravidian languages: 5; Chinese: 5, IndoEuropean languages: 4; Bask: 4; Hamitic languages: 3; Japanese: 3.
In view of that, Charles Dombi comes to the following conclusion: “Thus, from the evidence left by this process of colonization, it appears that the Sumerian city-states were able to exert a preponderant economic, cultural, linguistic and ethnic influence during several thousand years not only in Mesopotamia and the rest of the Near East, but also beyond, in the Mediterranean Basin, in the Danubian Basin, in the regions North of the Caucasus and of the Black Sea, the Caspian-Aral, VolgaUral, and Altai regions, as well as in Iran and India. It seems therefore that the Sumerians and their civilization had a determining influence not only on later Near-Eastern civilizations, but also on the Mediterranean, Indian, and even Chinese civilizations, as well as on the formation of the various Eurasian ethno-linguistic groups" (Dombi 2001, p. 7).

Estonian = Lapponic: 31% Estonian = Nganasan: 15%
Estonian = Selkup: 13%
Average: 19.67%
Laponic = Nganasan: 12%
Lapponic = Selkup: 8%
Average: 10.0%

Average: 22.0%
Average Finno-Ugric: 31.91%
Average Uralic: 24.54%
Total average Finno-Ugric-Uralic: 23.33%
Generally, according to Swadesh (1955) a language keeps each 1000 Jahre 86% from its vocabulary. Therefore we get the following table:
After 1000 years: 86% After 7000 years: 34.8%
After 2000 years: 73.96% After 8000 years: 29.92% After 3000 years: 63.6% After 9000 years: 25.73%
After 4000 years: 54.7% After 10’000 years: 22.13% After 5000 years: 47.04% After 11’000 years: 19.03%,
After 6000 years: 40.46% etc.
According to the calculated percentages, Proto-Uralic should have existed therefore about 9000 years ago. The separation of the Samoyed languages (Nganasan and Selkup) from Lapponic should have happened even about 11’000 years ago, i.e. still 2000 years before Proto-Uralic, whose members they are! As one can see very easily, both the hypothesis of a Finno-Ugric and of an Uralic language family lead themselves ad absurdum.
Languages with such small common lexical stock can best be considered Sprachbünde (loose language complexes), but never language families. Principally, also the question arises, if it is possible to reconstruct languages at 11’000 and more years back. Concretely speaking, this would mean – since the Uralic languages are a member of the Nostratic “language family” -, that the latter must be still several thousands, if not ten-thousands of years older then Proto-Uralic: an assumption that very probably has to be considered in the light of glottogony as pure nonsense.

4. Comparing Hungarian etymologies
from standard etymological dictionaries
We compare the etymologies of the 100 words in the basic Swadesh-List, as given in the following four standard Hungarian etymological dictionaries, whose abbreviations we use in the list that follows:
Bárczi = Bárczi, Géza: Magyar szófeitő szótár. Budapest 1941
Benkő 1 = Benkő, Loránd (ed.), A magyar nyelv történeti-etimológiai szótára. Budapest 1967ff.
Lakó = Lakó György (ed.), A magyar szókészlet finnugor elemei. 3 vols. Budapest 1967ff.
Benkő 2 = Benkő, Loránd (ed.), Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen. 3 vols. Budapest 1992ff.
Further abbreviations: UR = Uralic origin, FU = Finno-Ugric origin, U = Ugric origin, Tu = borrowing from a Turk language (including Turkish), Sl = borrowing from a Slawic language, — = unknown or uncertain origin. == (only in Lakó) means, that the word in question is not present in all (or in none of) the UR or FU languages.
As usual, derivations do not count, i.e. only the etymology of the stem of a word is considered (ex. g. farok, férfi, személy, etc.).

We now evaluate this list and show the development of Finno-Ugric linguistics in the past 65 years. Statistics of word origin brings the following results:
UR FU U Tu Sl doubtful uncertain/unknown
Bárczi 0 56 5 4 1 13 21
Benkő 1 24 26 5 4 1 14 25
Lakó 5 3
Benkő 2 26 23 4 3 1 15 28
The same Bárczi, according to whom only 61% of the basic vocabulary of Hungarian is shown here to be FU and U, asserted in his book “A magyar nyelv életraja” (Budapest, 3rd ed. 1975) that the share of FU or U words, respectively, is “not under 75%”.
Considering that UR was before the 4th millennium BC, FU about the 3rd mill. BC and U around the 1st mill. BC (cf. István Fodor, Verecke híres útján, Budapest 1975), between 13% and 15% of the Hungarian basic vocabulary ranges in a time space of not less than 3000 years (these are the “doubtful” words, that have been marked in the list by the question mark).
Despite (or because?) of increasing research in Samoyedic linguistis, the percentage of uncertain/unknwon etymologies grew from 21% to 28%.
If one follows the very strict rules imposed to historical language comparison by Gerhard Doerfer in his article “Bemerkungen zur linguistischen Klassifikation” (“Remarks to linguistic classification”, in: Indogermanische Forschungen 76, 1971), only 8% of the Hungarian basic vocabulary have a “proven” UR, FU, or U origin, i.e. for 92% of the basic vocabulary there is nothing such as a “proof”, that UR or FU build a “language family” and U builds one of the nodes of this “family”. This goes together with the results of Angela Marcantonio in her article “A case study within Uralic” (2004): “The key Ugric node, on which the family was historically based, has never been reconstructed, and it is widely recognized that Hungarian is radically different in morphology, lexicon and phonology from its supposed siblings in the Ugric node”.
In an earlier publiation “Is there a Finno-Ugric or even an Uralic language family?” (2006), I have already demonstrated on the basis of the Hungarian basic words themselves, that there is neither an Uralic nor a Finno-Ugric family. In this present article I have shown, that according to the etymological

reconstruction of the Hungarian basic vocabulary by the four standard etymological dictionaries, there isn’t either an Uralic nor a Finno-Ugric language family. Uralistics and Finno-Ugristics change their opinion about UR, FU, U, loanwords or uncertain and unknown origin of Uralic and Finno-Ugric works with each dictionary – without being able to show the reasons. On of these possible reasons is for sure not better insight on the basis of further results, since – as Marcantonio correctly remarked: “Most studies of the Uralic languages (...) do not state the sound-rules on which the correlations are supposed to be based”. Therefore, the main result of the present study is, that Uralistics and Finno-Ugristics are pseudo-sciences that work on the basis of kling-klang-etymologies.

5. Sumerian and Hungarian
Preliminary remarks: Gostony’s “Dictionnarie d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975) is ordered – as one would await from a Sumerian dictionary – according to the Sumerian words and word-groups. Yet, the ordering is not alphabetical, but according to special themes, i.e. semantically. (Inside of the semantic groups the order is not alphabetical either.) Moreover, the book has no register (a general disease of French scientific works). Furthermore, the semantic grouping of the Sumerian words results in the fact, that one and the same Hungarian word can occur (and many really do) more than one time. Several Sumerian words, too, appear more than once. These problems are the first reason, why I decided to order Gostony’s dictionary alphabetically according to the Hungarian words. In doing so, we get 1042 etymological articles, whose first line consists of the Hungarian entry, the second line of the sources (Sumerian dictionaries, vocabularies, glossaries, etc. used by Gostony) and the third line of the Sumerian etymon. The second reason, why I give here the full Sumerian-Hungarian list is, of course, because none of the languages, that will be compared with this list, contains all and the same entries as the Sumerian-Hungarian list.

The book “Affinitas linguae Hungaricae cum linguis fennicae originis grammatice demonstrata”, that appeared 1799 in Göttingen, written by the Hungarian physician Sámuel Gyarmathi, is nowadays officially regarded as the foundation of Finno-Ugristics. But a closer look at the 800 etymologies of Gyarmathi shows that only 34 or 4% are still considered to be correct (Hanzeli 1983, p. xxvi). Therefore, it is astonishing, that for his contemporaries Gyarmathi’s work “would provide a convincing proof of the existence of the Finno-Ugric family of languages and of the membership of his native language, Hungarian, in that family, so convincing that his work was accepted with broad approval by European scholars and that the filiation of Hungarian has never since been seriously questioned” (Hanzeli 1983, p. xvi). Besides the fact, that there very many attemps to question the Finno-Ugric hypothesis (cf. e.g. Érdy 1974), such an “approval” may be pardonable for pre-scientist at the beginning of the 19th century, but it is not understandable at all, why the mistaken concept of a Finno-Ugric familiy is still widely accepted today. Gyarmathi’s predecessor, whom he followed in the etymological part of his work, the Jesuit János Sajnovics, compared already in 1770 150 pairs of Hungarian and Lapponic words. Sebeok, in his foreword to the reprint of Sajnovics’s work, says that the author was “providing far-reaching and firm evidence for this hypothesis” (1968, p. 3) – in reality, there is none at all, since almost all of Sajnovics etymologies are today considered to be mistaken.
Nevertheless, both Sajnovics and Gyarmathi successfully banned the “Orientlistic” theory about the origin of Hungarian as inaugurated by Ferenc Otrokócsi Foris (1693) to the background. The reasons are clear for everybody who is acquainted with European history: After the end of the Turkish rule over Hungary (1526-1606), the Habsburgs influenced Hungary stronger and stronger, and from 1867 to 1918, Hungary was even as a kingdom a part of the Habsburgian empire. From this political fact, it follows, that it was not by chance, that the Indo-European comparative historical grammar was applied to Hungarian and his alleged relatives – since German, the official language of Austria, was already proven to be a member of the IE family. And neither is it by chance, that Hungarian was first compared with Lapponic, i.e. with the most distant of all alleged relatives of Hungarian, since in the 19th century, the Lapps still lived like people in the Stone Age. In other words: It was “proven” by Sajnovics, Gyarmathi and their successors, that the siblings of the Hungarians have no share with such ancient cultures like the Sumerians, the Akkadians and other Oriental people, to whom their origin was traced back since the 17th century.
The following map shows the geographical distirbution of the Finno-Ugric languages incl. Hungarian:

In the following, I compare the 1042 word articles from Gostony (1975), a work, that was published under the auspices of the French National Science Foundation under the directionship of the worldfamous Orientalist and professor at Sorbonne University, Raymond Jestin, with the 10’714 word articles in the “Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen” (EWU). I abolished all FU words of the 1042 etyma of Gostony (1975) that do not have at least one other testimony in one other FU language according to the EWU. There are many reasons, why the EWU has no other testimonies than the Hungarian word under discussion: 1. The etymology of an etymon is unknown. 2. The EWU claims for “onomatopoetical” origin (and thus it doesn’t supply us with an etymology). 3. The EWU claims that a certain word is “an inner-Hungarian development” (and hence without correspondences in other FU languages). 4. The stem of a word is considered to be “fictitious” (as a matter of fact, Hungarian is the only language all over the world that has such alleged “fictitious” stems). 5. The first or the second part of composed words has no correspondence in other FU languages. Moreover, in many cases, the EWU declares an etymology as “doubtful” or “uncertain”, but sometimes anyway gives alleged correspondences in other FU languages.
There are two other problems concerning the FU “family”: 1. In many cases (that I did not count), Hungarian words are compared with words of distant languages, most of all Permic ones. 2. Estonian seems hardly to be considered anymore a member of the FU “language family” – from our 1042 etyma only 6 words have a correspondence with an Estonian word – the same is true with most of the 10’714 word articles of the EWU. 3. Very often there is only 1 correspondence in 1 other FU language, and mostly this etymology is accompanied by phrases like “probable, uncertain, problematic”, etc. 4. As

Angela Marcantonio (2004) established: “The key Ugric node, on which the family was historically based, has never been reconstructed, and it is widely recognized that Hungarian is radically different in morphology, lexicon and phonology from its supposed siblings in the Ugric node”. It is also well known, that many nodes in the FU family tree have more sound-laws than examples to illustrate this sound-laws.

3. Conclusions
As a matter of fact, having compared the 10’714 word articles of the EWU with the 1042 word articles in Gostony (1975), we got not more than 286 Hungarian-Sumerian-FU etymologies. This means: Only 27% of the common Sumerian-Hungarian words are shared by other FU languages – to little a number to speak about a genetical relationship, that would be required for a language family. In another paper (Toth 2006), I have compared the 100 words Swadesh-list with the same FU languages that I was working here, and the result was, that 31.9% of Hungarian words are shared with the other FU languages – the percentages are thus pretty close to one another. Hungarian is, therefore, not genetically related to the FU languages, although some of them may have been more of less strongly influenced by Hungarian. Probabaly, the FU languages – amongst them I understand from now on all FU languages without Hungarian – were spoken by an Urbevölkerung, whom the Hungarians met during their wandering from the shores of the Black Sea headed for the Carpathian Basin. They may have either stayed a while together with members of this Urbevölkerung or a few of them may have joined the Hungarians. The last assumption would also explain, why they are f.ex. Permic and other FU loanwords in Hungarian and why in many cases Vog. and Osty. do not share Hungarian words, but e.g. Finn. and/or Lapp. do.

7. Caucasian and Hungarian
1. Introduction
The Caucasus Mountains have ever played a big role in the discussions about the origin of the Hungarians (cf. the standard work Bendefy 1941/2002). This may also have to do with the fact, that the Caucasian languages – divided in many groups and subgroups each of them containing several languages that differ a lot from one another and that are extraordinarily complex - have a very long time never been researched thoroughly. Even today, there are many data lacking. Linguists like Karl Bouda and Johannes Hubschmid tried to assemble the little available data mainly from Russian and Armenian vocabularies, glossaries and directly from the few available texts. The first languages to be described were the South Caucasian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian, Laz, etc.), that served as a basis for Michael von Tseretheli’s studies “Sumerian and Georgian” that appeared between 1913 and 1916 and that serve also as a basis for our present study.
The map underneath shows the Caucasian languages in a broader context:

3. Conclusions
From the 260 etyma given by Tseretheli (1916), only 78 or 30% are shared by Gostony’s etymological dictionary (1975). The one reason for that we have already mentioned: The more or less catastrophic situation of Caucasian language data at the beginning of the 20th century. The other reason is that Tseretheli had to work with the very earliest Sumerian sources (cf. Tseretheli 1913, pp. 785ss.), i.e. he did not even have the first reliable Sumerian dictionary of Friedrich Delitzsch, that appeared in 1914, not to speak about Father Deimel’s “Šumerisches Lexikon” (Rome 1928ss.) and later works. So, Tseretheli’s both fundaments – the Sumerian as well as the Georgian – were fragmentary and provisional. Therefore, it does not astonish either, that his 78 remaining Sumerian-Hungarian-Georgian etymologies make only 7% of Gostony’s word list. But nevertheless, one does not get the impression, that Caucasian and Hungarian are closely related as the older history works wanted to teach us. In the opposite: Despite the bad sources, with which Tseretheli had to work, it seems strongly, that the Caucasian mountains were only a marching-through-area of the Sumerians on their long trip from Mesopotamia into the Carpathian basin.

1. Introduction
The Reverend W. Wanger, author of many publications and scientific grammars of the Ntu (Bantu) languages, esp. Zulu, wrote in the introduction of his book “Comparative Lexical Study of Sumerian and Ntu (Bantu)”: “Sumerian can be shown to be ‘the Sanscrit’ for the immense Ntu family of languages” (Wanger 1935, p. xxxvii). In other words: Since Sumerian is the oldest testified language of the world, it can be taken as an existing basis instead of the reconstructed proto-pseudo languages (cf. also Marácz 2006) like Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Finno-Ugric, Proto-Altaic, etc. Wanger further mentions, that therefore there was no need for him either to reconstruct a hypothetical Proto-Bantu, since he compares the real Sumerian with the real Bantu tongues and since in many cases esp. Ntu conserves both the form and the meaning of words not only similarly but identical (cf. f. ex. Wanger 1935, p. 79, here no. 47). From this point of view, the often heard counter-argument against comparing Sumerian with one of the living languages is pointless.
The following map shows a very rough distribution of African languages:

Already Meinhof (194-15) had shown grammatical and some lexical parallels between Sumerian and several African languages. An unsolved problem is the relationship between the Bantu languages and other African languages, since we find Sumerian traces in both groups (cf. Czermak 1921-22; Drexel 1919-20; Hummel 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Wölfel 1955).

3. Conclusions
Wanger (1935) wrote an impressive study containing more than 330 pp., but with only 138 Sumerian words taken from Delitzsch (1914), since the “Šumerisches Lexikon” of Father Anton Deimel was only to appear, when Wanger wrote his book. (This is also the reason, why only 83 of these 138 Sumerian words are mentioned in Gostony 1975, who is based on Deimel and newer dictionaries, vocabularies and glossaries). Nevertheless, Wanger concluded already in an earlier study, that was meant as a prodromus for his later book: “Von Sumer fällt unstreitig viel Licht auf Afrika” (From Sumeria, there is no doubt, much light falls on Africa” (Wanger 1929, p. 563). But in reality, only 83 words or 8% are shared with the 1042 word articles of Gostony’s reference work “Dictionnarie d’étymologie

sumérienne” (1975). The Bantu languages come therefore just before the Polynesian languages, that share 82 words or 7% of the common Sumerian-Hungarian cognates from Gostony’s dictionary.
How did the Sumerians come to Africa? Wanger’s indications are in this point underdetermined: “The only possible conclusion, I believe, is that the mother-tongue from which both the Sumerians and the forefathers of the Ntus drew their fundamental idea of grammar as well as the greater part of their vocabulary common to both, belongs to prehistoric times. This would also explain why the Zulus like all Ntus have no kind of writing, whilst them Sumerians had” (Wanger 1935, p. vii). However, this cannot be true, since the Sumerians came from Transylvania (Erdély, Siebenbürgen) (cf. von Torma 1894; Vlassa 1963; Badiny 2001) according to the testimony of the Tatárlaka writing, that is about 2000 years older than the first picture-cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia. So, if the Bantus had a common origins with the Sumerians, they also would have a writing. So the lacking script is a very strong argument against a common origin of both people. The only explication of the little SumerianHungarian traces in Bantu is through emigration out of Mesopotamia. But only very few Sumerians could have come to Africa, since otherwise they would of course have thought their writing to the indigenous people, that must have been already there. Moreover, since many Bantu (yet less Zulu) words conserve form and meaning of Sumerian words, the emigration must have been in a very early time: As early as from the 26th century B.C. on, the Akkadians started to torment the Sumerians.

9. Etruscan and Hungarian
Already in 1874, the British priest Isaac Taylor brought up the idea of a genetic relationship between Etruscan and Hungarian (Taylor 1874). Since the very influential linguist August Friedrich Pott accepted this relationship in the first number of his journal “Internationale Zeitschrift für Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft” (the first journal of General Linguistics), this relationship was internationally accepted (Pott 1877, pp. 15ss.). In 1917, the German linguist Georg Sigwart showed the relationship between Etruscan and Sumerian (Sigwart 1917, esp. pp. 148ss.), by which the relationship between Sumerian, Etruscan and Hungarian was established. On the XIX. International Congress of Orientalists in Rome, 1935, Félix von Pográny-Nagy gave a widespread lecture about his own new researches in the area of Etruscan, Hungarian and Sumerian (von Pográny-Nagy 1938, pp. 77-81), that was only an excerpt of a much bigger work (von Pográny-Nagy 1936-36), that was unfortunately never published. Several Sumerian-Etruscan-Hungarian etymologies came from the famous historian Viktor Padányi in various studies (e.g. Padány 1963, esp. pp. 435ss., and 1964).
Under the huge pressure of the Finno-Ugric scholars, that would not accept the Sumerian-Hungarian theory, the Etruscan-Hungarian hypothesis, too, lost its importance in the last decades, because its adherents were blacklisted and banished from the leading FU journals. However, recently the situation changed mainly because of two reasons: 1. Since Hungary was liberated in 1990 from the communist leaders, the publication of non-FU research is again allowed in Hungary. 2. The Internet has been used worldwide as a medium of distribution of all these banned articles of the independent scholars. Meanwhile, also well-installed university professors are to be found amongst the “mavericks” of FU linguistics and therefore, the situation has turned around: The supposedly stable seats of the traditional FU linguists begin to shake, and never before – not even during what was called in linguistics the “Second Hungarian-Turkish war” – the FU linguists in and outside of Hungary had to defend themselves with such aggression (cf. Marácz 2006a, 2006b, 2006c).
The present status of research of Etruscan can be characterized like that: Certain scholars 1. accept, that Etruscan is non-Indo-European, but claim that it is a linguistic isolate (the majority of linguists, leaded by Pfiffig and Pallottino); 2. accept, that Etruscan is non-IE, related to Hungarian, but not to Sumerian (this is nothing else but a form of denial of the Hungarian-Sumerian theory, most prominent representative is Alinei); 3. accept, that Etruscan is non-IE and related to both Hungarian and Sumerian (the already mentioned authors, in newer time also Zászlós-Zsóka 2001 and many others); 4. claim that Etruscan is IE (basically Italic, Greek, Hittite) (Georgiev, Steinbauer, Bomhard). As category 5. one could still mention very few scholars (mostly non-linguistics), who want to connect Etruscan with any other language, e.g. Caucasian.
Etruscan is a corpus-language, i.e. we know only of a very limited number of words and grammatical structures. Most of the known words belong to similar semantic fields, since the Etruscan inscriptions are mostly dedications to gods or stand on gravestones. Furthermore, the meanings of many words are controversial. In our list, we give the meanings according to Majláth (2005), in the case of discrepancies also according to Alinei (2003). For the sound-laws concerning Etruscan and Hungarian cf. Alinei (2003, pp. 281-318), for the sound-laws concerning Sumerian and Hungarian cf. Gostony’s “Dictionnaire d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975).

The following map shows the Etruscan territory in the 6th century B.C.:
The Etruscan-Hungarian word list, that I will present now, contains 280 etymologies, around 33% of which have Sumerian etymologies. This percentage is higher than the percentages between Hungarian and the FU languages (27 % resp. 31%, cf. Tóth 2006a, 2006b), even unlike Etruscan, the FU languages are not corpus languages.

Osc. touto, Umbr. acc. totam “civitas” < IE *teutā “people” (Walde and Pokorny 1930, p. 712), to which is put usually also the family name Tóth, but it is not convincing at all, that one of the most common Hung. names is of IE origin. Therefore, Bobula (1970, p. 82) proposed sum. tu-tu “to give birth, to father” as etymology, which is indeed compatible both with the IE and the FU words, so that Hung. may have taken the words from Sum. and given it to FU, while the IE words come either also directly from Sum. or are borrowings form FU.

The simple fact, that it is possible to establish 280 pairs of Etruscan and Hungarian words that are related via sound-laws, proves, that Etruscan and Hungarian are really genetically related to one another. Considering the fact, that our knowledge of Etruscan is very limited, the further fact, that 33% of these 280 Etruscan-Hungarian etymologies have Sumerian cognates – again proven by sound-laws -, shows, that Etruscan is an even better-than-average member of the FU language family. Comparing the oldest known Hungarian texts, the Halotti Beszéd and the O-Mária siralom (12th/13th centuries) with the Etruscan-Hungarian inscriptions, one must conclude, that the Etruscans cannot have been Hungarians who emigrated from the Carpathian basin to Tuscany and related areas, where they show up since about 800 B.C. Also the fact, that we have clear traces of Lydian influence in Etruscan (lacking in Hungarian) leads to the assumption that Etruscans and Hungarians must have separated from one another already in Mesopotamia. Probably, the time under discussion is the Seevölkersturm time (sea people movements), i.e. the 13th and 12th centuries B.C. The later Etruscans must therefore have spent around 400-500 years in the Greek archipelago, what also explains the Greek loanwords in Etruscan.

10. Tibeto-Burman and Hungarian
1. Introduction
Kőrösi Csoma Sándor, or, as he is called outside of Hungary, Alexander Csoma de Körös, was born at the end of March 1784 in Kőrös, a small village in the county of Háromszék in south-eastern Transylvania (Erdély). After having studied philology in Nagyenyed (Hungary) and in Göttingen (Germany), he started his life-long trip on foot in order to discover the homeland of the Hungarian people. He spent eight years in the monasteries of the Himalayan provinces and worked through the whole Kanjur and Tanjur, 320 large printed volumes, that contain the classical Tibetan literature, in order to write the first Tibetan-English and Tibetan-Sanskrit-English dictionaries, the first Tibetan grammar in English and a long series of articles dealing with Tibetan literature. The commentaries to the Tibetan texts, that he read together with two lamas came to be known as the “Alexander books”, written in the form of a dialogue in which Csoma asks basic questions and the lamas do their best to answer. The “Alexander books” immortalized Csoma in Tibetan literature. Csoma’s work “can be considered the last great feat of European discovery” (Fox, p. 61).
But the founding of Tibetology was not the primary intent of Csoma. He wanted to prove, that the original homeland of the Hungarians laid in the north of Tibet. He wrote: “Since I acquired the absolute conviction that if God keeps me alive I can carry out and prove within a short period of time what the supporters and friends of our national language and literature have desired for so long ... about the original homeland of our nation” (ap. Fox, p. 37). Csoma believed, that the most ancient homeland of the Hungarian ancestors lies in Great and Little Bokharia, two vast, geographically separated areas now defined as being in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, and Yarkand in the Tarim basin, which is north of the Tibetan plateau and is now within the Chinese territory of Xinjiang. In studying the language and literature of Tibet he hoped to find references in the Tibetan texts that would prove his case about the origin of the Hungarians. In the foreword to his Tibetan-English dictionary, Csoma wrote about himself: “To his own nation he feels a pride in announcing, that the study of the Sanscrit will be more satisfactory, than to any other people in Europe. The Hungarians will find a fund of information from its study, respecting their origin, manners, customs, and language; since the structure of the Sanscrit (as also of other Indian dialects) is most analogous to the Hungarian, while it greatly differs from that of the languages of occidental Europe” (Kőrösi Csoma 1834, p. xlvixlvii).
On his last attempt to reach Yarkand, the supposed homeland of the Magyars, how Hungarians call themselves, he died on malaria near Darjeeling, shortly after beginning the most ambitious journey of his life, an attempt to enter the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, and travel over the Himalayan plateau to the desert plain of western China, where he hoped to find the ancestors of the Hungarian people. But his travel ended only after a few days. Dr. Archibald Campbell, the physician and superintendent of the station at Darjeeling, wrote: “It is with much regret that I report the death at this place, on the 11th instant (April 1842), of Csoma de Kőrös, the Hungarian traveler and Tibetan scholar. He fell victim to a fever, contracted on his journey hitherto, for the cure of which he would not be persuaded to take any medicines until it was too late to be of any avail” (ap. Fox, p. 92) He was buried the next day in the

British station’s burial-ground. His grave at the foot of the Himalaya is conserved and a highlight of Hungarian pilgrimage.
In 1933, nearly a century after his death, the Tokyo Buddhist University in Japan declared Alexander Csoma de Kőros a Bodhisattva, en enlightened being who postpones his entry into nirvana in order to help others on their path to enlightenment. A shrine was dedicated to him, with a bronze statue of Csoma sitting in the lotus position. In the same spirit, the main Buddhist institution in Hungary is named after him, the Alexander Csoma de Körös International Institute of Buddhology, and there are all over the world Kőrösi Csoma Sándor foundations, who support the research of the Hungarian homeland. “And we in India, the Asiatic Society in Calcutta especially, can claim him, as Hungary does, as one of India’s heroes also” (Mukerjee, p. viii). “To think of Csoma de Kőros is to think thus, in Indian terms, of the Tapasvin, the lonely seer, ‘not a glowing coal but a shining lamp; he is not only consumed, he illumines’” (Mukerjee, p. 6).
But the fact, that Csoma never reached Yarkand, leaded certain of his biographers to strange and false conclusions. I will cite here two passages of Fox’ biography “The Hungarian who walked to Heaven”, one of the most widespread English works about Csoma: “He never made it to Yarkand, the imagined seat of his ancestors. If he had, he would certainly have been disappointed. There is nothing at Yarkand. It is a small caravan town in the desert (...). Scientific rationality wasn’t the point. Csoma’s theory wasn’t really a theory at all. It was a personal myth, a private heaven (...). In Csoma’s myth of Yarkand, he played the part of the redeemer, guiding his oppressed people back to the haven of their original homeland, an idealized Buddhist Hungary situated in the remotest spot on earth, beyond the planet’s highest mountains” (Fox, p. 94).
“Csoma was, as all who met him agreed, a very strange man. A contemporary psychiatrist might have diagnosed him with a variant of narcissistic personality disorder” (Fox, p. 95.) After, the author quotes a passage of the “American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition”.
Against these insults speak, that:
1. Yarkand was the seat of an ancient Buddhist kingdom on the southern branch of the Silk Road. The fertile oasis is fed by the Yarkand River which flows north down from the Kunlun Mountains and covers now some 3,210 km2, but was likely far more extensive before the period of desiccation began to afflict the region from the 3rd century B.C. onwards (cf. Wikipedia, s.v.).
2. In Yarkand, there are the ruins of a settlement and a mountain (1570m) with the name “MazarTag” (Times-Atlas), whose etymology is the same as that of Magyar, the self-denomination of the Hungarians.
3. Dr. Bátor Vámos-Tóth found 24 place-, river-, sea- and mountain-names in Tibet, that are phonetically identical with corresponding names in the Carpathian Basin (cf. in the Internet s.v. “Tamana”).

4. The famous French orientalist Jacques Bacot, wrote in his book, “Le tibet révolté, vers Népémakö, la terre promise des Tibétains” (English translation by A.T.): “I will learn there, looking at abandoned villages, about the existence of Népémakö, the Promised Land of the Tibetans, to which the defeated people emigrated. Where exactly is Népémakö situated? Behind the Tsarong, people say, between the Poyul and the Himalaya. The Tibetans have discovered it eight years before. At that time, it was still uninhabited. This is a very hot country ‘as hot as is India’, covered with flowers and so fertile, that one has not to work, but only to pick the fruits of the earth. Before its discovering, the lamas knew its existence from the books, since in the 8th century, the Hindu missionary Padma Sambhava visited it (Bacot, p. 10). The etymology of Népémakö is Hung. nép “people” and Makó (Hungarian place name, cf. Kiss II, p. 83). The –ö instead of the –ó shows, that this place name comes from a time, where vowel harmony was not yet finished.
5. And last but by no means least, there is an enormous amount of archaeological evidence. I will cite here directly from the report, published on February 6th 1995 by an American journalist in the “Washington Post”: “The latest research began in 1986, when, after a break of 79 years, the Chinese government allowed Hungarian researchers back to a graveyard about 30 miles east of Urumchi, the capital of Xinjiang Province in the northwest corner of China. The cemetery was discovered in 1907 by the Hungarian explorer Aurél Stein. Hungarian researchers have excavated 1,200 graves and have found archaeological objects similar to those found in Hungarian cemeteries dating from the 9th and 10th centuries. Weapons placed in the graves are similar, and the methods of burial and the writing systems are the same. ‘In these parts are hidden secrets never before seen’, said István Kiszely, a prominent Hungarian ethnographer. Near the grave site, Kiszely and other researchers happened upon a small ethnic group called Ugars by the Chinese – a group distinct from the more populous Uyghurs, a Turkic people that dominates Xinjiang. The scientists discovered that among them, the Ugars, who only number 9,000, knew 73 songs that fix exactly into the pentatonic, or five toned, musical scale that has made Hungarian folk music, popularized by composer Béla Bartók, famous worldwide. ‘We found the last lady who is singing their folk music, and she sings it just like we Hungarians’, Kiszely said” (Pomfret, p. 2). The Ugars share their name with the Hungarians (in German: Ungarn), whose language officially belongs to the Ugric group of the Finno-Ugric family. Professor István Kiszely, who taught also in the United States, summarized his findings and conclusions in his monumental two volumes work, that appeared in 2000.
The following map shows Kőrösi Csoma Sándor’s long way from Transylvania to Darjeeling:

2. Sumerian-Tibetan-Hungarian etymologies
After the first work about the genetic relationship between Tibetan and Sumerian appeared (Bodua 1938), decades had to pass, until in 2001 and 2004, respectively, the two small but extremely important volumes “Sumerian and Tibeto-Burman” appeared, written by the internationally recognized orientalist Jan Braun of the University of Warsaw. In his works, the author brings about 341 Sumerian-Tibetan word equations and gives also detailed phonetic correspondences. Since Braun as well as Gostony (1975) used the same basic work for their etymologies, Anton Deimels monumental “Šumerisches Lexikon” (Rome 1927ss.), it was for this chapter possible to compare Hungarian and Tibetan words directly via their common Sumerian roots on relatively modern standard. Therefore, the 232 common Sumerian-Tibetan-Hungarian etymologies, that I will present here, are free from being biased by “nationalistic” interests or allegedly “mistaken” etymologies of one of the authors, since Gostony died long before Braun’s works appeared, and Braun did not use and obviously not even know Gostony’s dictionary.

3. Conclusions
After the Hungarian archaeologist Zsófia von Torma leaded excavations in the Transylvanian Maros area already in 1876 (Torma 1894), in 1961, the Rumanian archaeologist Nicolae Vlassa found the socalled Tartaria Tablets which show a script, that is partially pictographic and partially runic. With aid of C14-method, the Tablets have been dated to 5000-5500 B.C. (Badiny, p. 186) and are therefore about 2000 years older than the oldest Sumerian inscriptions (Glassner, p. 49). Since the Sumerian cuneiform originated in a pictographic script (Meissner and Oberhuber, p. 18), many researchers believe, that this pictographic script had been brought to Mesopotamia from the carriers of the Jemdet-Nasr-Culture (about 3100-2900 B.C.) out of Transylvania (Vlassa 1963).
For Jan Braun, the correspondences between Sumerian and Tibetan prove astonishingly, that the Sumerians originated in Tibet: “Five and a half thousand years ago, Sumerian brook off from the Tibeto-Burman trunk and migrated far west to southern Mesopotamia” (2001, p. 91).
Yet, from the undeniable C14 dating, it is clear, that 5500 years ago and thus at the time of the UrukWarka IV-Culture (approx. 3500-3200 v. Chr.), the carriers of Sumerian writing and language were on their way from Transylvania, in an area not too far away, where Kőrösi Csoma Sándor was born in 1784, and Mesopotamia. But since the correspondences between Hungarian and Tibetan are overwhelming – approximately 70% of Braun’s etymologies -, they are in fact genetically related. The only possible conclusion, therefore, is, that the Sumerians migrated to Tibet from Mesopotamia and not opposite. Since Akkadian influence on Sumerian can be attested already since the 26th century B.C. (cf. Lieberman 1977), this is the terminus post quem for a migration of Sumerians up to the Yarkand plateau and further. A probable guess of the time of this migration may be the great movement of the sea people, i.e. in the 13th century B.C.
So, Kőrösi Csoma Sándor was right and not right at the same time. He was right with his idea to find some of the ancestors of the Hungarians in Tibet (as Friar Julianus found some in Bashkiria in the 13th century). Had he made it up to the Tarim Basin, he would have found even the Ugors and recognized, what only Kiszely recognized almost 150 years later, namely that the Tarim Basin was not only a former homeland of the Hungarians, but that still archaic Hungarians are living there. Because Csoma did not exspect that, he was even more right, than he thought. But his was not right with his assumption, that the Tarim Basin was the original homeland of the Hungarians. The original homeland was Mesopotamia, but Csoma could not know that, since in his life time the Sumerian inscriptions were not yet detected and thus the Sumerian language unknown. To come to an end, one word about Csoma’s assumption, that Sanscrit is related with Hungarian. Csoma must have heard about the beginnings of Indo-European studies made by Bopp, so it must have been clear to him, that Sanscrit and Hungarian cannot be related really. But it was also Csoma who detected, that the biggest part of the Tibetan literature are nothing but translations from Sanscrit. So, since Csoma believed, that the Tibetans are the ancestors of the Hungarians, he must have come to the conclusion, that the real origin of Hungarian lies in Sanscrit.

11. Munda languages and Hungarian
1. Introduction
The Munda Languages are a language family spoken by about 9 million people in eastern India and Bangladesh. Since the pioneering work of Father Schmidt (1906), who took them together with the Mon-Khmer languages, that are morphologically completely different, they still constitute a branch of the so-called Austroasiatic language family, but nowadays placed in opposition to the Mon-Khmer languages of Southeast Asia. According to the linguistic community, the origins of the Munda languages are unknown, though it is generally thought that they are autochthonous languages of eastern India.
The bipartite Diffloth (1974) classification is widely cited:
• North Munda • Korku
• Kherwarian
• Kherwari branch: Agariya, Bijori, Koraku • Mundari branch: Mundari, Bhumij, Asuri, Koda, Ho, Birhor • Santali branch: Santali, Mahali, Turi • South Munda
• Kharia-Juang: Kharia, Juang • Koraput Munda
• Remo branch: Gata (Gta), Bondo (Remo), Bodo Gadaba (Gutob) • Savara branch: Parenga (Gorum), Sora (Savara), Juray, Lodhi
The following map shows the greater area in which the Munda languages are spoken:

Already in 1928, the Hungarian engineer Hevesy Vilmos (Wilhelm von Hevesy, Guillaume de Hevesy) doubted the classification of Father Schmidt and denied the existence of an Austroasiatic language family. Von Hevesy published first using the pseudonym “F.A. Uxbond” a book under the title “Munda-Magyar-Maori”, from which he dissociated himself later. Yet in 1932, he published another book under the title “Finnisch-Ugrisches aus Indien”, in which he tried to prove that “into northern India there might have been migrated a people in pre-Aryan time, that spoke a Finno-Ugrian language” (1932, p. 1). Although von Hevesy compared in his 1932 book all Finno-Ugrian languages with basically the Kherwarian branch of Munda – especially with Santali and Mundari, since there were no other dictionaries at hand in his time -, he strongly focussed in his conclusions that the basic stock of these Finno-Ugrian people were the Hungarians: “That the Magyars might have passed the Caucasus mountains on the way to their new homeland, is very probable, since the route from India led to the shore of the Asowian Sea, where the Magyars are historically remarked first” (1932, p. 337).
In a series of articles, that appeared between 1930 and 1936, von Hevesy tried to convince further the linguistic community about his proof, that the Munda languages form an own branch of the FinnoUgrian language family (von Hevesy 1930-32; 1934; 1935a; 1935b; 1936a; 1936b). His theories were refused by most linguists, but there were also a few who agreed to him. George Dobo wrote: “There can be little said against the crushing bulk of Mr. de Hevesy’s linguistic demonstration. Should some of them prove daring, nay, erroneous, the great mass of his material cannot be upset. Many who shook their heads suspiciously at the early and daring works of Professor Sapir on Paiute and Southern Nahuatl had to admit later that the ‘flair’ of a man of genius is able to see beyond a few technically incomplete demonstrations” (1933, p. 552). Another famous linguist who believed in von Hevesy’s theory was F. Otto Schrader. He wrote: “That von Hevesy has really proven his hypothesis, we just have to accept” (1935, col. 637). But most known von Hevesy got as the decipherer of the Easter Island Script: His deciphering was generally accepted by Robert von Heine-Geldern. Although Thomas Sebeok remarked only in a footnote “Similarly Hevesy’s Munda-Finno-Ugrian hypothesis is irrelevant” (1942, p. 212, note 26), he did not bother three years later to consecrate a whole article to this alleged “irrelevant hypothesis” (Sebeok 1945). The sad lowpoint was finally reached in the discussion after a lecture of von Hevesy in occasion of the “III Congresso Internazionale dei Linguisti” (Rome, September 19-26 1933): “E(rnst) Lewy underlines, that the author (von Hevesy, A.T.) of these

extensive lectures is not a specialist in the narrowest sense, but an amateur of linguistics, to whom the specialists in linguistics are indebted for his suggestions (...). We (Ernst Lewy, A.T.) will, as soon as we can, follow the suggestions of H. seriously and without prejudice (...). Needless to say, that this never happened. But not enough with that: It was – despite all efforts – impossible for me to find out even the lifetime and some basic biograpahical facts about Wilhelm von Hevesy. He is not even listed in the monumental “Magyar Életrajzi Lexikon” (Hungarian Biographical Lexicon).
Therefore, about 70 years later, I prove herewith, that von Hevesy was right. Von Hevesy did not have the change to prove his theory using as a base the Sumerian language, since Father Deimel’s “Šumerisches Lexikon” had just started to appear in the late twenties.
From the 1042 word equations, that Gostony gives, I present in the following 340 SumerianHungarian-Munda word equations out of the stock of 1134 that von Hevesy presented. This proves, that about 30% of von Hevesy’s Hungarian-Munda equations have a Sumerian basis and that about 33% of the Sumerian-Hungarian equations are shared by the Munda languages. I purposely did not use any other dictionaries than von Hevesy’s 1932 book in order not to contaminate his data. The percentages, however, are sufficient enough to prove in accordance with von Hevesy, that the Munda languages do form an own branch of Finno-Ugrian and that Hungarian is thus related with the Munda languages.

3. Conclusions
About a third part of the Munda etymologies as presented by von Hevesy are shared both with Sumerian and with Hungarian. Pure change is thus excluded. As already suggested by von Hevesy, the ancestors of the Munda speakers must have come from somewhere to the area in which they live now since thousands of years. The fact, that the percentages between Hungarian-Sumerian etymologies and Hungarian-Sumerian-Munda etymologies are almost identical is a strong hint for the assumption, that these ancestors came from Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia had, as it is well known, very intense commercial relations with India already thousands of years B.C. I can, however, not agree with von Hevesy’s hypothesis, that a part of Munda speakers left India in order to travel to the Asowian Sea and further into the Carpathian basin. Considering the fact, that Sumerian was the ancestor language of Hungarian, it would make no sense at all, if we would assume, that the Sumerians first emigrated to India and then made their way back in order to travel in the diametrical direction. Having shown that the Munda languages form an own branch of Finno-Ugrian and that the strongest component of Munda is Hungarian, is a merit for which we have to be deeply thankful to Wilhelm von Hevesy.

12. Dravidian languages and Hungarian
1. Introduction
After the pioneering works of Schrader (1935-37), Burrow (1943-46) and Bouda (1953), in 1968, Stephen A. Tyler presented “positive evidence for a genetic relation between Dravidian and Uralian. The major evidence consists of systematic phonemic correspondences between 153 Proto-Dravidian and Proto-Uralian lexial items” (1968, p. 798). Therefore, also Hungarian must be related to Dravidian. The Dravida language are grouped as follows:
Southern
• Kannada • Malayalam • Tamil • Badaga • Bellari • Irula • Toda • Tulu • Kanikkaran • Kodava Takk (Kodagu) • Koraga • Kota • Kurumba • Paliyan
South Central
• Telugu • Abujmaria • Gondi • Kui • Kuvi • Konda • Koya • Manda • Pengo

Central
• Kolami-Naiki • Naiki • Northwestern Kolami (India) • Southeastern Kolami (India) • Parji-Gadaba • Duruwa (India) • Mudhili Gadaba (India) • Parji • Pottangi Ollar Gadaba (India)
Northern
• Brahui (the only Dravidian language spoken in Pakistan; in the Balochistan province) • Kumarbhag Paharia - (India) • Kurux language (India) • Kurux language Nepali - (Nepal) • Malto • Sauria Paharia (India)
As abbreviations we use the first two letters unless this leads to confusion. Only the main languages Tamil (Tam.), Malayalam (Mal.), Telugu (Tel.) and Kannada (Kann.) are abbreviated with more than two letters. The following map shows the geographical distribution of the Dravida languages today:
The material, that I present in the following, comes from the very thorough studies of Zoltán Szabó (Szabó 1982, 1983), and is compared to the 1042 word-articles from Gostony (1975). Comparing the three languages, Sumerian, Hungarian and Dravidian, we get 377 common etymologies; the Dravidian languages share therefore 36% of the Sumerian-Hungarian cognates.

3. Conclusions
Szabó drew the following conclusion: “This study intends to bring Magyar (Hungarian) and Dravidian out of their ill-assumed isolation. It is the testimony of their languages that they formed a cultural entity prior to the invasions of the peoples of the North” (Szabó 1982, p. 832). Hence, he does not say, if the Hungarians originated in the South of India or emigrated to there from Mesopotamia. The latter seems to assume Fane: “In summary, there was a migration of pastoralists into India – from the same general area, and in the same general period – as that in which the earliest inhabitants of Mesopotamia entered the Fertile Crescent” (Fane 1980, p. 296). Since it is proven, that the Sumerians came from Transylvania (Erdély, Siebenbürgen) (von Torma 1894; Vlassa 1963; Badiny 2001) according to the testimony of the Tatárlaka writing, that is about 2000 years older than the first pictural-cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia and since there are strong connections between the writings of the Sumerians and the Indus Valley civilzation (Parpola 2000), that was the first major urban culture of South Asia and reached its peak from 2600 B.C. to 1900 B.C. roughly, it is to assume, that the Sumerians wandered westward to India from Mesopotamia. Also, from the 26th century on, the Akkadian pressure started in Sumeria, so that we have to suppose political reasons for their emigration. For this early time of wandering out of their homeland speaks also the fact, that only 36% of the Dravidian etymologies are shared with the Sumerian-Hungarian ones. (Had Szabó used classical historical etymology instead of semantically based “Wurzeletymologie”, the percentage would be even much lower.) Nevertheless, this percentage is still higher than the percentage of relationship between Hungarian and the so-called “Finno-Ugric langagues”, that ranges between 27 % and 33% (Tóth 2006a, 2006b).

13. Chinese and Hungarian
1. Introduction
Podhorszky (1877) compared a few thousand Hungarian etyma with Chinese, but without giving sound laws. However, if we use this old work in the present article as a basis for our own etymologies, we have to defend the author, since all the other Finno-Ugric dictionaries are by no means better, since they do not provide us with sound laws, either. And this is true for most dictionaries of other language families as well. One of the very few exceptions known to me is Starostin’s, Dybo’s and Mudrak’s “Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages”. We will cite the Chinese forms like Podhorszky did with two exceptions: We mark vowels (e.g. ă, ĕ) and indicate tones only in order to avoid homophones, otherwise diacritica and explications like “barytonic” have been let away. Using as our basis again the Sumerian-Hungarian word list from Gostony (1975), we get the following 638 Hungarian-SumerianChinese etymologies.
The following map shows the geographical distribution of Chinese and its neighbouring languages:

3. Conclusions
We find, that not less than 61% of the Sumerian-Hungarian etymologies appear in Chinese. This is a very strong hint that obviously a big part of the Sumerians did not emigrate into the Carpathian Basin, but to China and from there maybe they wandered to Tibet and possibly also to South Asia. But we find another very interesting fact, I mean the Hokkjen forms, that are in 100% of the cases much closer

to the modern Hungarian forms than the standard (Mandarin or Cantonese) Chinese forms given by Podhorszky. We cite only a few examples: Hung. akarni, Chin. uh-juh “to wish”, Hokkjen ük, ak “id.”; Hung. árnyék, Canton. nik “to hide”, Hokkjen njek “id.”; Hung. átok, Chin. to, ta “mutual curse”, Hokkjen tok, tak “id.”; Hung. bok, Chin. muh “wood, tree”, Hokkjen bok “id.”; Hung. csapni, Chin. cha “to hit”, Hokkjen chap “id.”. Yet, Hokkjen (or Hokkien) is a local variant of Minnan, spoken in Penang and is characterised by the pronunciation of words according to the Zhang-Zhung language (Haarh 1968). This extinct language belonged to the Tibetan branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, and must have been under the strong influence of the Hsiung-nu language of the Huns (Hummel 1975, 1976), since there is no other possible explication about the very noticeable closeness of the Hokkjen and the Hungarian forms. Now, the Huns, whose empire stretched from the steppes of Central Asia into modern Germany and form the Danube river to the Caspian Sea, settled in Central Asia approximately from the 4th to the 6th century A.D. And, as Podhorszky (1877, p. 125) remarks correctly, the Chinese-Hungarian comparisons represent still a period of the language, when prefixes were used. This points also to approximately the same time-span like the settlements of the Huns in China and confirmes our assumption, that Zhang-Zhung must have been influenced stronly by Hsiungnu.

14. Japanese and Hungarian
1. Introduction
Since the appearance of Roy Andrew Millers book “Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages” (1971), it is mostly, but not generally, assumed, that Japanese belongs together with Turkic, Manchu-Tungus and Mongolian (and perhaps Korean) to the Altaic linguistic family. Most influenceful for this assumption was Karl H. Menges review of Millers 1971 book (Menges 1974). Yet there is also not a general, but at least a widespread agreement, that the forementioned languages form a family in the linguistic sense. A big step towards acceptance was the publication of the “Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages” by Sergei Starostin, Anna Dybo and Oleg Mudrak (2003) with its 2800 etymologies: “After a critical evaluation of the problem we came to the conclusion that Altaic should still be characterized as a genetic unity (...). The very fact that it is possible to compile a dictionary of common Altaic heritage appears to be a proof of the validity of the Altaic theory (2003/I, p. 9).
This little map shows the geographical position of the Japanese language:
In the following, I compare Japanese with Hungarian, but not directly, as Kazár (1980) did it in the whole range of all Uralic and Altaic languages, from whom we take our Japanese reflexes, but again via their common Sumerian basis according to Gostony (1975), i.e. I compare his 1042 SumerianHungarian etymologies with the 594 Japanese-Hungarian etymologies in the Finno-Ugric dictionary part of Kazár (1980, pp. 12-213). In doing so, we get 235 common Sumerian-Japanese-Hungarian etyma, that I will present in the next chapter.

3. Conclusions
These 235 etyma correspond to 23% of the common Sumerian-Hungarian etyma in Gostony (1975) and to 40% of the Japanese-Hungarian etyma in Kazár (1980). The relatively low rate of common Sumerian-Hungarian-Japanese etyma may be interpreted as a hint, that we have not to assume – like e.g. in the case of Tibeto-Burman and the Munda languages – a migration of Hungarians to Japan, but rather that the common etyma are due to the fact, that Japanese is a member of the Ural-Altaic macrofamily.

15. Turkish and Hungarian
1. Introduction
To compare Turkish and Hungarian is kind of a risky business, since both languages claimed and still claim to be the inheritors of the Sumerians, the representatives of the first high culture on earth. For Turkish, one should consult the exhaustive study of Laut (2000), especially the chapters about the “Sun Theory” (Güneş Dil Teorisi). Therefore, it is not astonishing at all that amongst the abundance of comparative linguistic literature both on the Turkish and on the Hungarian side we find many treatises that have been written more or less openly with nationalistic purposes. Moreover, the oldest Turkish texts date from the 8th century B.C. and the oldest Hungarian texts from the 12th century B.C., while Sumerian was extinct already around 1800 B.C., so that the time difference between the youngest Sumerian and the oldest Turkish and Hungarian testimonies, respectively, are rather enormous – not to speak about the philological problems involved in Sumerian. In order to avoid biased data, we thus compare again Turkish and Hungarian not directly, but via their common Sumerian roots, using Gostony (1975) for Sumerian and Hungarian and Sára (1994, 1999) for Hungarian and Turkish.
The following map shows how widespread the Turkic languages are:
In the following, I present 577 Hungarian-Sumerian-Turkish etymologies. Yet, in very few cases I have given a word from another member of the Turkic language family, when no Turkish etymology was at hand (e.g. Chuvash, Chagatai, Yakut, Uighur), in one case (no. 722) I have even added an obvious etymology by myself, since Sára must have forgotten it by chance. It must be pointed out, however, that the present work cannot and does not want to be a comparative dictionary of the Turkic languages. Whoever is interested in finding out, in which other Turkic languages than Turkish a certain reflex

3. Conclusion
Via their common Sumerian roots, Turkish and Hungarian share 557 or 55% of their etyma from the 1042 etyma of the comparative Sumerian dictionary by Gostony (1975). This strongly points to a common Sumerian origin of both the Turkic and the Hungarian people, that was already postulated by Hommel (1915) and confirmes the early hypothesis of Ungnad (1927; 136, pp. 11ss.) that the cradle of the Turkic people stood somewhere in the Oxus area in today’s Turkmenistan:

The Turkic languages play also an important role in the so-called Eurasian substrate (cf. chapter 9 and Hummel 1991).
Since the Greek (Konstantinos Prophyrogennetos, 11th century) and the Arabic (Ibn Fadlan and others) sources (10th century) constantly consider the Hungarians to be a Turkic people (cf. Moravcsik 1942, 1958), one may assume – in the light of the main result of the present study, i.e. the 55% of common Sumerian-Turkish-Hungarian cognates -, that the Turkic people and the Hungarians may have separated only after having still having lived together some centuries in today’s Turkmenistan after wandering out of Sumeria. Therefore, the Hungarians, who were bound to the Carpathian Basin, could not have taken – as it is generally assumed (cf. e.g. Bobula 1967) – the direct way from today’s Iran via the Black Sea towards the north. This eastward instead of northward route would also explain, why Friar Julianus found still in the 13th century Hungarians in Bashkiria, since Bashkiria lay – very roughly speaking - on the way from Mesopotamia to the Oxus area and then in a huge semicircle-turn to the Carpathian Basin. So, a few of this Sumerians, that were not to form the different Turkic people that spread out from Eastern Europe to Sibria and even Western China, neither to become the ancestors of the today’s Hungarians including the Csángós, must have settled in Bashkiria, where they were later melted together with the Turkic speaking Bashkirians – after all originally their relatives.

16. Austronesian and Hungarian
1. Introduction
Many researchers assumed already very early that there is a strong linguistic connection between India, China, Tibet, Burma, Japan and the Malayo-Polynesian archipelago (e.g. Kőrösi Csoma 1834/1984, Podhorszky 1877, De Charency 1896, Uxbond 1928/2006, Matsumoto 1928, Rivet 1929). This is also one of the reasons, while up to now the linguistic classification of the languages involved in this huge area is still controversial. For example, Rivet (1929), from whose work we took the data for the present article, considered amongst “Oceanian” not only Melanesian, Polynesian, Micronesian and Indonesian, but also Mon-Khmer, Munda, Australian and Tasmanian. Nowadays, there is no classification, that unites all these languages. We have chosen here the name “Austronesian”, to which we add – quite unusually – also Mon-Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian. This decision has, however, rather practical reasons than theoretical implications: The comparative corpora of the Australian and the Tasmanian languages (extinct since 1905) with the other languages here under discussion are too small or not even existing to be treated separately, so we follow Rivet (1929) with the only exception, that we do not take into consideration the Munda languages here, because they are treated separately.
Another problem is, that Rivet (1929) does not make clear, which dictionaries he used for his booklet. Furthermore, he does unfortunately not differentiate between the hundreds of languages that range under “Melanesian, Polynesian, Indonesian”, etc. At the time, when Rivet wrote his word lists, the big dictionaries of Traeger (1891) und Skeat/Blagden (1906) had appeared since a long time. Without any doubt, Rivet could have enlargened his corpus massively, had he used this standard works. Considering the fact, that Rivet brings on 46 pages only ca. 150-200 etymologies, while Gostony (1975) contains 1042 entries, it does not astonish, that the common Hungarian-Sumerian-Austronesian etymologies, that we are able to present in the following, are so few, namely 82 or 3%. Therefore, here is still much work to be done in the future: The systematical comparison of Gostony’s dictionary with Traeger, Skeat/Blagden and most of all Dempwolff (1934-38) – and also with Brunner (1982).
Rivet, however, deserves the praise, that he was the first to understand and establish the linguistic connection between what he calls Oceanian and Sumerian: “En résumé, du Japon à la Tasmanie, de la Méditerranée et de l’Afrique à l’Amérique, on peut suivre pas à pas les multiples étapes, presque exclusivement maritimes, des membres d’une seule et même famille linguistique, dont le centre de dispersion paraît avoir été l’Asie méridionale ou l’Insulinde”. In other words: Rivet assumes a gigantic substrate, that reaches from Japan to Tasmania, from the Mediterranean Sea and Africa to the Americas and to the South Seas. This presupposes in accordance with the conviction of the present author, that the Sumerians did not just “disappear”, but emigrated out of their homeland, probably under pressure of Semitic people, who invaded already since the 26th century into Mesopotamia.

If one has a look at these 82 etymologies, one recognizes immediately, that most etymologies are shining up in Melanesian and Indonesian, then in Polynesian, then in Australian, also often in MonKhmer, but more seldom in Tasmanian and very seldom in Micronesian. This does not support Rivet’s assumption, that the Sumerians spread out from Oceania in order to build a far-reaching substrate, that reaches from the South Seas to the Mediterranean and from Africa to the Americas. Our results suggest the contrary assumption: That the Sumerians spread out from Mesopotamia via India, China, Tibet, Japan further into the south and as far as Tasmania. As a matter of fact, they left there traces in the Oceanian world, that reaches from Madagascar in the West to the Easter Islands in the East – more than half a turn around the globe. The fact, that even so distant people like a Maori and a Hawaiian can understand one another without bigger problems, shows that we have to assume in this far-reaching area basically one huge substrate: the Sumerian, as was correctly assumed by Rivet (1929). Also von

Hevesy (1934, col. 670) assumes a settlement of the island of the Pacific Ocean that started in Indonesia; already in the 5th century A.D. the Polynesians had reached Hawaii. But von Hevesy (who deciphered the Easter Island script) also points to the remainders of a “gigantic neolithic culture” (loc. cit.), that must have established between 5000-2000 B.C. in Oceania and thus fits perfectly in the timeframe of the assumed emigration of the Sumerians and the proven invasion of the Akkadians into Mesopotamia.

17. Mayan languages and Hungarian
1. Introduction
Stig Wikander proved in three articles that the Mayan and the Altaic languages are genetically related (Wikander 1967, 1970, 1970/71). Karl Bouda showed in a long series of articles the genetical relationship between Altaic, Mayan and some other Meso- and South-American languages (nos. 148, 156, 158, 164, 166, 168, 172, 179, 182, 183, 197, 208, 220 in Schiefer 1975). Provided that the Altaic and the Finno-Ugric languages are also genetically related to one another, it follows that Hungarian and the Mayan languages must be genetically related, too. In the following, we use as data base for Mayan the 3 volumes work of Dienhart (1989) with its ca. 40’800 entries of 31 Mayan languages. For Hungarian we use again Gostony (1975).
The Mayan languages constitute a family of related languages spoken in Mesoamerica from southeastern Mexico to northern Central America and as far south as Honduras. Their common ancestor, known as Proto-Mayan, is reconstructed with a time depth of at least 5000 years, and many Mayan languages are still spoken as a primary or secondary language by more than 4 million indigenous Maya. The Mayan language family comprises five sub-families and includes many languages that are spoken in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. In Mexico, Mayan languages are spoken in seven states: Chiapas, Tabasco, Yucatectán, Quintana Roo, Campeche, San Luis Potosí and Veracruz. In Chiapas, all the languages are Mayan (except Zoque), as are virtually all the indigenous languages of Guatemala.
The following tree-model shows a possible linguistic evolution of the present Mayan languages from Proto-Mayan:

3. Conclusions
111 Mayan words are shared with the 1042 Sumerian-Hungarian etyma of Gostony (1975), or 11%. Since all the etymologies are mine, I handled them with special care. For example, the obvious palatalisation k > č, found in many Mayan languages, was accepted, but in lack of further research the palatalization t > č was excluded until evidence will prove this sound-law. Under the hypothesis that this sound-law is valuable, we would have gotten about the double amount or 20-22% of common Sumerian-Hungarian-Mayan etymologies. But still, with its 11%, the Mayan languages stand between African and Japanese (Austronesian 3%, Caucasian 7%, African 8%, Japanese 23%, other Finno-Ugric languages besides Hungarian 27%). Interestingly enough, most parallels between Sumerian-Hungarian and Mayan languages are to be found in an area that comprises the northern and central parts of the Yucatectán peninsula, northern Belize and parts of Guatemala. E.g. 39 parallels show up in Yucatecan, 36 in Itza, 35 in Mopan, etc. From the numbers 1, 2, 5 and 8 are conserved since Sumerian time in today’s Mayan languages, even they are not even conserved in most of the so-called Finno-Ugric languages, not to speak about the well-known almost complete absence of common number names in the Altaic languages.
From the percentages it results, that the Sumerians had much more influence in Mesoamerica than they had f.ex. in the Caucasus Mountains (where there was according to many researches their homeland!) or in Africa, although these regions were extremely much closer of their Mesopotamian homeland. So, the question arises: How and when did the Sumerians get to Mesoamerica? One would think of Swadesh’s Bering-Street theory, since the genetical relationship between some Paleo-Sibirian languages in the Old World and some Uto-Aztecan languages in the New World had been proved in the past 50 years. But, unfortunately, neither in Yenissean, Chukchi, Kamtchadal or other languages Hungarian cognates are to be found, even Bouda (cf. the bibliography of the respective works in Schiefer 1975) assumed a genetical relationship of these and some other languages in the huge area around the North Polar Sea with Finno-Ugric.
The only other alternative that has been brought up to now is Barry Fells’s Transatlantic Migration Theory (cf. Fell 1977). As already mentioned in the introduction, Proto-Mayan is reconstructed at about 3000 B.C. At that time, according to Fell (1977), the first accidental transatlantic drift-voyages have been made by Iberians and Libyans. It is clear, that they reached the south of North America, but did they also reach Meso-America? And were Sumerians on these ships, too? According to Marini (1985, 1986, 1987), a Sumerian inscription was found in Fuente Magna, La Paz, Bolivia, whose date “may be around or before the year 2000 B.C.” (Marini 1985, p. 10). A very special variant of early migrations between Europe and the Americas was brought up by the Hungarian-Ecuadorian engineer Juan Moricz (i.e. Móricz Opos János): According to him, “the magyars of the Carpathian Mountains (...) are of American origin”, being survivors of the Deluge, “but those on the crests of the Andes were primarily responsible for the post-diluvian dispersion of knowledge and culture: that between 8000 and 7000 B.C. they arrived in Lower Mesopotamia in boats made from balsa wood found only in South America” (Hall 2005, cf. also Hary Györgyné 2003). This hypothesis, however, fails, because we know through witness of their writing, that the Sumerians came from Transylvania to Mesopotamia (Badiny 2001).
We must assume, after all, that a very early migration brought Sumerians on ships (assumingly not their own, but perhaps Libyan and Iberian ships) to America, maybe first to North and then from there to South-America (since there are no indications for direct voyages of any people from the Old World to

Meso-America). This could have happen as early as a little after 3000 B.C., since from the 26th century on, the intruding Akkadians started to torment the Sumerians and pushed them out of Mesopotamia. Anyway, the Mayan languages are an important part of the huge Sumerian heritage spread out to all continents by the ancestors of the today’s Hungarians.

18. Conclusions
In chapter 3, we found that from the ten Finno-Ugric languages Hungarian, Vogulic, Ostyak, Syryen, Cheremis, Mordwin, Finnic, Estonian, Lapponic and the two Samoyed languages Nganasan and Selkup, the Finno-Ugric group shares only 31.91% of common words – ranging from 34% down to 10.0%, the two Symoyed languages only 22%, and therefore the average percentage of all Uralic languages is as low as 26.95%. Given these calculations, according to the Swadesh list and its related statistics, Proto-Uralic should have existed about 9000 years ago, the separation of the Samoyed languages should have happened even 2000 years earlier in open contradiction with the fact, that then they split before they got a member of the Proto-Uralic family, etc. What we want to point out is that the Uralic theory leads itself ad absurdum.
On the other side, Hungarian shares 91% of its basic vocabulary with Sumerian and 7% with Akkadian, the other big language spoken at about the same time in Mesopotamia, before the Sumerians started to emigrate. Starting with the Sumerian-Hungarian theory, only 2% of the Hungarian words are meanwhile still “of unknown origin”. However, in chapter 4, we showed, that according to four standard etymological dictionaries of Hungarian, between 25% and 39% of the Hungarian words are “of unknown origin” – and an extremely high percentage - probably more than 50% - is in addition to them of “uncertain”, “difficult”, “problematic” etc. origin. We draw two conclusions out this facts: First, the Finno-Ugric and Uralic theories at unscientific, because they contradict their own principles, and second, there are neither a Finno-Ugric nor an Uralic language family. The few common words that the Northern “Finno-Ugric” and the Samoyed languages share with Hungarian, have all their roots in Sumerian and must therefore be explained via borrowing from Hungarian.
In the following, we shall show the respective percentages of shared cognates between Sumerian, Hungarian and the other languages that have been scrutinized in this book:
Chapter 5: Hungarian = Sumerian: 1042 words = 100%
Chapter 6: Hungarian = “Finno-Ugric” languages: 31.9%
Chapter 7: Hungarian = Caucasian: 7%
Chapter 8: Hungarian = Bantu: 8%
Chapter 9: Hungarian = Etruscan: 33% (but here the reference was not Gostony 1975)
Chapter 10: Hungarian = Tibeto-Burman: ca. 50% (here, the reference was not Gostony 1975, either)
Chapter 11: Hungarian = Munda: 33%
Chapter 12: Hungarian = Dravidian: 36%
Chapter 13: Hungarian = Chinese: 61%
Chapter 14: Hungarian = Japanese: 23%
Chapter 15: Hungarian = Turkish: 55%

Chapter 16: Hungarian = Austronesian (incl. Mon-Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian): 3%
Chapter 17: Hungarian = Mayan: 11%
If we order these languages according to the percentages of their genetic relationship, we get:
Hungarian (100%) > Chinese (61%) > Turkish (55%) > Tibeto-Burman (ca. 50%) > Dravidian (36%) > Munda (33%) = Etruscan (ca. 33%) > “FU” languages (31.9%) > Japanese (23%) > Mayan (11%) > Bantu (8%) > Caucasian (7%) > Austronesian (incl. Mon Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian) (3%).
We can now draw the following conclusions:
1. The two “Turanian” languages Hungarian and Turkish show naturally a high percentage of genetic relationship (55%), while the relationship between Hungarian and the other “Turanian” language considered in this book, Japanese, is rather low (23%). Perhaps, this is a hint to do further research in order to control if Japanese is really an Altaic language or not. Like Sumerian and Hungarian, all “Turanian”, i.e. Ural-Altaic languages are agglutinative.
2. While the genetic relationship between Hungarian, Turkish and (probably) Japanese is not a surprise, Kőrösi Csoma Sándor’s theory of a very significant Hungarian-related population in Tibet is fully confirmed (ca. 50%). Like Sumerian and Hungarian, Tibetan is an agglutinative language, but strangely enough with ablaut (apophony).
3. A surprise is that Dravidian has a higher percentage (36%) of genetic relationship than the Munda languages (33%). But nevertheless, von Hevesy’s idea that the Munda-Khol family must be accepted as another member of the “Finno-Ugric” languages, is confirmed. Both Dravidian and the Munda languages are agglutinative like Sumerian and Hungarian.
4. Since the idea, that Etruscan and Hungarian may be genetically related, is pretty old, it is not a surprise, that both languages share ca. 33% of their cognates. Like Sumerian and Hungarian, Etruscan is agglutinative.
5. The “FU” languages, that share between 10% and 31.9% of their word stock, have already been explained as genetically not related to Hungarian, their common vocabulary and certain grammatical features, e.g. agglutination, being considered as borrowed.
6. A surprise are the 11%, that Hungarian shares with the Mayan languages. They are even 1% closer related to one another than the two allegedly closely related Samoyed languages Naganasan and Selkup. There can be no doubt, that there is a genetic relationship between Hungarian and the Mayan languages, which may probably also explain, why the Mayan languages are agglutinative, too.
7. Bantu (%), Caucasian (7%) and Austronesian (incl. Mon Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian) (3%) can hardly be considered genetically related to Hungarian, even Bantu and Caucasian are

agglutinative, too. The cognates shared between these languages and Sumerian may be explained by wanderings of people of the Indian continent southwards.
8. After all, despite the knowledge that genetic relationship between languages does not follow necessarily from the fact that these languages share certain typological features, it is rather surprising and cannot be considered by change that from the 14 languages or language families, that were researched in this book, 13 are agglutinative.

1. Introduction
In the most recent Sumerian Grammar (Edzard 2003), Dietz Otto Edzard deals on less than one page with the possible relationship between Sumerian and other languages under the title “The (hopeless) question of the linguistic affiliation of Sumerian”, thus proving to be biased from the beginning. Superfluous to say that he does not even mention the very well known Sumerian-Hungarian language comparisons that started already in the 19th century (cf. Érdy 1974).
According to Edzard, there are two reasons, why “the problem is practically insoluble”: 1. “Sumerian must have separated from a hypothetical language family of which it was part in the middle or late fourth millennium B.C. at the latest. We know next to nothing about the sound and structure of Sumerian before the middle of the third millennium. Thus there is a gap of at least two thousand years between that time and the oldest reconstructible form of any languages which have been compared to Sumerian” (2003, p. 2). – Here is to say that the time difference between Vedic (testified since about 1500 B.C.) and Albanian (testified since about 1500 A.D.) is around 3000 years, thus one millennium more than between Sumerian and the oldest reconstructible form of an other language. Therefore, according to Edzard, it would not have been possible to prove that both Vedic and Albanian belong to the Indo-European language family. However, this is internationally accepted by all linguists.
Edzard’s other objection against the comparison of Sumerian and any other language is: 2. “Efforts to find cognates have been exclusively based on the sounds of individual words” (2003, p. 2.). – Here is to say that this is simply not true, because even the kling-klang etymologists always considered the semantic similarities between words, too. Moreover, the comparison of words – consisting of sounds and semantics – is exactly the method how the Indo-European language family has been established. But not enough with that: Proto-Indo-European is a reconstruction that never existed as a language, while Sumerian was once a living and not an artificial language. Moreover, there is to underline that the comparison of two non-artificial languages like Sumerian and Hungarian is methodically acceptable, while the comparison of a couple of languages with an artificial language like Proto-Indo-European is unscientific, because Proto-Indo-European was first reconstructed from the alleged Indo-European languages and then the affiliation of this languages to a hypothetical Indo-European language family was “proved” by comparing them to the reconstructed Proto-language – this is thus logically circular and methodically unacceptable.
In this contribution I show the linguistic relationship between Hungarian, Sumerian, and Egyptian. The method that I use is historical linguistics, but I will follow the same strategy that I have already established in EDH (Tóth 2007): There I took the Sumerian-Hungarian dictionary of Gostony (1975), revised it by correcting mistakes and updating this standard work to the newest results of Sumerology. The result were 1042 safe Sumerian-Hungarian cognates that I compared after with words of other languages that had been compared to Hungarian by other authors already before. Therefore, I always compared at least the cognates of 3 and not only 2 languages with one another, hence excluding the danger of mistaken etymologies as much as it is possible in diachronic linguistics. Mathematically speaking, the fact that only two languages have 1042 common safe cognates excludes the chance, but the other fact that I was able to show remarkable numbers of cognates in 17 language families comprising several dozens of languages excludes any doubts of the genetic affiliations of the languages compared.
Hungarian and Egyptian were compared to one another relatively late – first by the Hungarian historian Tibor Baráth (Baráth 1968-74; Baráth 1973; Baráth 1988; Baráth s.a.), but according to Lajos Bíró, “Th. Glock 1916-ban azt írta, hogy a magyar nép az egyiptomi-főníciai kultúrkörből ered” (Bíró s.a.). In 1935/36, the Finn hobby-researcher Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa published his “capital work” about the alleged Fenno-Egyptian cultural origin of the whole Old World, claiming amongst other things that there is no Indo-European language family and trying to “prove” his theory by giving such “word

equations” like English (!) pyramid = Finn pyhät raamit “holy frame”. By another “equation”: Bonaparte = Finn Punaparta = “Redbeard” he proved that he is unable to differentiate between nouns and names, that he does not know that certain words are borrowings and that he does not know Latin. That he did not even know the parts of speech, he proved with his “equations” German “der (masc. article)” (English “the”) = Finn terä = phallus, penis, and German “die (fem. article)” = Finn tissi = “tits, bosom”. Attempts like this damaged the comparison of any member of the so-called Finno-Ugric language family – and thus traditionally also Hungarian – with Egyptian enormously.
It was only by chance that I learned in the fall of 2006 about a to me hitherto unknown publication by the Finn linguist Helmi Poukka: “Unkarin ja Egyptin sanojen vertailua” (Poukka 1979). My extensive researches showed that this booklet is only in one library of the world – according to “WorldCat”: in Kent State University Library in the U.S. But since American copyright law did not allow me to get a copy of this book and since the rules of this University Library did not allow me either to borrow this book, because it is a typewriter manuscript (that was given to Kent by István Erdély), I had no chance to use it for EDH (Tóth 2007). That I finally got a photocopy of this booklet, that contains 9461 common Egyptian-Hungarian etymologies, I owe to the generosity of PD Dr. Johannes Reckel of Göttingen University. Since the American copyright law does not apply for borrowings outside of the US, Dr. Reckel was able to get a copy of Poukka’s remarkable work and could send it to me – back to the US.
Poukka follows the transcription of Erman and Grapow (1961). For technical reasons, I had to replace h with a dot underneath by ħ and h with a semicircle underneath by h, the one example where dotted w appears, I had to use underlining.
1 The numbering of the cognates in Poukka’s works jumps from no. 845 to 946, thus the nos. 946ss. should be read as 846ss., so that the booklet does not contain 1046 cognates, as indicated, but “only” 946. This fact is taken into consideration in our present study.

3. Conclusions
Egyptian shares 382 of the 1042 Sumerian-Hungarian cognates of Gostony (1975) and Tóth (2007, chapter 5), respectively, thus 36.7%. Therefore, Egyptian stands from its genetical affilitation to Sumerian-Hungarian between Hungarian and the Munda languages (33%) and Hungarian and the Dravida languages (36%), cf. Tóth (2007, chapter 18). But Egyptian shares also 33% with the common Hungarian-Etruscan cognates (Tóth 2007, chapter 9), that are, however, not won by using Gostony’s list, since because of the fragmentary character of Etruscan, the correspondences of most Etruscan words are neither known in Hungarian nor in Sumerian. But the same percentage of SumerianHungarian cognates both in Egyptian and in Etruscan confirmes the hypothesis of Glock (1916, ap. Bíró, s.a.), Padányi (1963, pp. 167ss.) and Baráth (1968-74) that Hungarian, Egyptian and Etruscan are genetically strongly related to one another and that Sumerian-Hungarian was definitively the most influenceful language in the Mediterranean area.
Since Egyptian is a member of the Hamito-Semitic or Afro-Asiatic languages, and since Hungarian and the Bantu languages share only 8% of their cognates (Tóth 2007, chapter 8), in Egyptian there must be the Asiatic and not the African part of this language family that is genetically related to SumerianHungarian. Since this Asiatic part in Egyptian is Semitic, is it a desideratum for the future to compare Sumerian-Hungarian with the Semitic languages, most of all with its oldest testified member, Akkadian. First attempts – completely neglected by mainstream-researchers – were made by Kiss (1839), who compared Hungarian with Hebrew because at his time the cuneiform writing was not yet detected and thus Akkadian still unknown, and Giesswein (1887, 1888) who already considered the first results of the deciphering of Akkadian and also took Egyptian into consideration. The idea of comparing SumerianHungarian with Semitic languages like Akkadian results also from the simple fact that the Sumerians and the Akkadians were neighbors in the Euphrat-Tigris basin and influenced one another also linguistically strongly. Moreover, the Akkadians took their cuneiform writing from the Sumerians, and this writing goes back to the script found by Zsófia von Torma (1894) and Nicolae Vlassa (1963) in Tatárlaka/Tărtăria on the so-called Tartarian Tablets (cf. Tóth 2007, in press).
Our 382 Sumerian-Hungarian-Egyptian cognates share also 40% of the 946 Hungarian-Egyptian cognates found by Poukka (1979). The reason, why this percentage is not higher, is simply, because Poukka used mostly other Hungarian words than we did sticking to the corpus of Gostony (1975) and Tóth (2007, chapter 5) for the sake of making this present study compatible with EDH (Tóth 2007). If one would etymologize Poukka’s Hungarian corpus according to the Sumerian-Hungarian sound laws established by Gostony (1975), there could be no doubt, that the percentage of the genetical affiliation between Sumerian-Hungarian and Egyptian is much higher than 40%. This would confirm basically the following statement by Baráth (1968, vol. 1): “Az úgynevezett szumír és egyiptomi nyelv eredetileg uganyaz a nyelv”. But because of Baráth’s exaggeration (he was not a linguist), I can, however, not agree with his idea that Sumerian and Egyptian “were in fact the same” (Baráth, s.a., p. 1), and neither can I agree with his assumption of a forward-and-backward movement of the Sumerian-Hungarians: “It is also believed that [the language, A.T.] spread from Sumer toward the southern part of the country and later to the east all the way into the Mediterranen (...). After the Egyptian kingdom was firmyl established (1500 B.C.), it spread toward the great bend of the Euphrates river and Syria” (Baráth, s.a., p. 1). Baráth does obviously, although he was a historian, not know that the Pre-Sumerians originated in Transylvania and after having completed their wandering to Mesopotamia turned the Transylvanian Tordos culture (5500-5000 B.C.) into the Sumerian Uruk Warka IV (ca. 3500-3200 B.C.) and the Jemdet Nasr (ca. 3100-2900 B.C.) cultures that are basically identical (von Torma 1894, Vlassa 1963, Badiny 2001, Tóth 2007, in press).
But also generally speaking, languages – as the relatively recent language death theory teaches us – do not die out normally from one decade or century to the other (except in the case of epidemics or genocide, like in the case of Tasmanian). As I have shown in Toth (2007, in press), the downfall of

Retoromance in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley took over 1400 years, and many words, expressions, even suprasegmental (phonetical) and syntactical phenomena of Retoromance are still to be found in the today wholly germanized area. Considering the fact, that Retoromance was and still is a rather unimportant language that did not have cultural impacts like f.ex. Sumerian and Akkadian did, we must conclude that the time of the death of this languages was either much later than hitherto assumed or that they went through a long period of transformation like e.g. Latin did in developing into the Romance languages. It is therefore impossible to believe what such an authority like Woolley (who was one of the excavators of Sumer) wrote about the Sumerians: “Their language, though fallen out of popular use, might long survive in religious texts to be studied by the curious and painfully understood by the aid of a dictionary; but the race had gone, exhausted by wars, sapped by decay, swamped by the more vigorous stock which had eaten the tree of their knowledge” (Woolley 1929, pp. 181ss.).
Woolley’s flowery way of speaking shows nothing but his bare incompetence about language decay as well as linguistics in general. According to mainstream-research, all old cultures (or, to speak with Oswald Spengler in his “Der Untergang des Abendlandes”/”The Decay of the West”: Alle Hochkulturen/All high-cultures) without exception disappeared suddenly without leaving back any linguistic or cultural traces. If there are doubtless common words in Sumerian, Akkadian, ..., and still living languages, then these are considered to be Wanderwörter. In a PhD dissertation of the University of Arizona, Tucson, a doctorand even listed amongst the reasons why the Aztec culture allegedly vanished so “suddenly” also the possibility that the Aztects my have taken away by an U.F.O. That the Sumerians were not taken away by U.F.O.’s and that the Sumerian language did not die out – neither long before Christ nor in later centuries – but went through a transformation into Hungarian and several dozens of other languages, was shown hopefully for once and ever in EDH and the present study. But the work is not yet finished.

1. Introduction
In a recent paper (Tóth 2007a), I have stated that the common Sumerian-Hungarian cognates as established in the works of Gostony (1975) and Tóth (2007), share at least 36,7% with Old Egyptian. Since Old Egyptian is a member of the Afro-Asiatic language family and since the common cognates between Sumerian-Hungarian and African languages are only 8% (cf. Tóth 2007, chapter 8), the genetic affiliation between Sumerian-Hungarian and Old Egyptian must be due to the Asiatic part of the AfroAsiatic or Hamito-Semitic language familiy, as it was called earlier, and therefore be Semitic.
Now, the research about a possible genetic relationship between Hungarian and the Semitic languages (Akkadian, Aramaic, Hebrew, Phoenician, Arabic, etc.) is scarse, and almost all works appeared in the 19th century (cf. Kiss 1839, Giesswein 1887, 1888). Moreover, both Kiss and Giesswein were fathers resp. theologists and therefore had an interest to prove that Hungarian is related to the “holy” language of the Old Testament. Also, the linguistic methodology was not yet fully established in the 19th century, so that the works of Kiss and Giesswein must be consulted carefully. But in 1932, there appeared the over 1200pp. work of the French linguist Hilaire de Barenton (de Barenton 1932), according to whom most of the languages of the world go back to Sumerian. In de Barenton’s work, in which we find also a few hundreds of Sumerian-Semitic-Hungarian correspondences, the methodological progress of historical linguistics is obvious, since de Barenton works consistently with sound-laws, while his predecessors just compared more or less phonetically and semantically corresponding words.
While the works of Giesswein and de Barenton are relatively easily accessible, the work of Bálint Kiss (1772-1853) is hardly available outside of Hungary. Similarly to the situation of my Hungarian-Egyptian paper (Tóth 2007a), I got a copy of Kiss’s book only after having finished EDH (= Tóth 2007), so the present study, too, is an addendum to EDH. I owe much thanks to Dr. Klára Koltai of Kossuth Lajos University Library in Debrecen for having sent me Kiss’s book on CD. Linguistically, the pages 17-73 are of primordial interest, since there Kiss gives a list of many hundred Hungarian-Hebrew and Hungarian-Aramaic (Chaldaean) correspondences. Unsusual for Non-Hungarians, Kiss brings his Hebrew and Aramaic examples in Hungarian phonetics (since at his time an International Phonetical Alphabet was not yet established). But since the readers of this journal are used to Hungarian phonetical writing and most of all since Galgóczy (1909, 1911) showed that using Hungarian phonetics can help to understand the sound values of the Sumerian cuneiforms, we do not change Kiss’s writing for the present study. All of Kiss’s word equations have been checked according to the SumerianHungarian-Hebrew sound laws given in de Barenton (1932), whose work was also the basis for Gostony (1975) on which I further built my EDH (Tóth 2007).

3. Conclusions
294 of 1042 or 28% of the Sumerian-Hungarian cognates in Gostony and EDH, respectively (cf. Tóth 2007, chapter 5) are shared with Hebrew. The genetical affiliation between Sumerian-Hungarian and Hebrew stands therefore between Sumerian-Hungarian and Japanese (23%) and Sumerian-Hungarian and the “Finno-Ugric” languages (31.9%). It will be a desideratum for future research to scrutinize how many correspondences there are between Sumerian-Hungarian on the one side and the oldest testified Semitic language, Akkadian, on the other side. This task will, however, be difficult, because it is known that there are already Akkadian loanwords in Sumerian (and also Sumerian loanwords in Akkadian), cf. Zimmern 1917 and Lieberman 1977.
Basically, because Hebrew was only in use since about 1200 B.C. (Stempel 1999, p. 11) and Aramaic only since 1000 B.C. (Stempel 1999, p. 13), we must assume that Kiss’s Hebrew examples have relatives already in Akkadian that is testified since 2500 B.C. (Stempel 1999, p. 9). This assumption is confirmed by such examples like Hung. fehér “white” ~ Hebr. peér, Hung. fel “up” ~ Hebr. pele, Hung. fél (felet) “half” ~ Hebr. pelág, where Hebr. p- = Hung. f- like in Arab., while Akk. has p- like Hebr. does. Since Arabic is testified only since the 5th century B.C. (Stempel 1999, pp. 13s.), this sound-change cannot be dated (Brockelmann 1961, § 47). But we find the same correspondences in Etruscan: Hung. fedni “to cover” ~ Etr. penznas, Hung. főző “cooking” ~ Etr. pazu “cook”, Hung. fő, fej “head” ~ Etr. pepn “main-, boss”. Since in chapter 9 of EDH we came to the conclusion that the Etruscan-Hungarians separated from the rest of the Sumerian-Hungarians approximately at the time of the Sea People’s Storms (ca. 13th/12th century B.C.) and since we found in Etr. also cognates, where Etr. p corresponds with Hung. p (Hung. párolini “to steam” ~ Etr. parliu) and with b (Hung. béke “peace” ~ Etr. paci “quiet”), showing that in the 13th-12th centuries B.C. the sound-change p = p > b > f was not yet finished, we may assume that this change happened shortly after the Etruscan-Hungarians entered the Mediterranean. Therefore, the Semitic sound-change Proto-Semitic p- = Arab. f- is obviously due to Hungarian-Etruscan influence in the Mediterranean. This assumption is confirmed by the fact that amongst the Semitic languages only the Southern Semitic languages (Arabic and Abessinic) participated in this sound-change. We may thus conclude our present study with the main result that the SumerianHungarian influence on the Semitic languages other than Akkadian (that was the Sumerian neighbourlanguage in Mesopotamia) must have started also approximately in the 13th and 12th centuries B.C.

1. Introduction
It was only recently, after having finished my work on EDH-1, EDH-2, EDH-3 and EDH-4 (Tóth 2007), that I could get from Europe the very seldom booklet about Magyar-Mongolian comparison by Szentkatolnai (1877) which is completely unavailable in the United States. In the Mongolian examples in chapter 2, I will use the same orthography as Szentkatolnai (including “cz” for today Hungarian’s “c”) did. Two additions of his etymologies are mine (“add. Tóth”), taken from Vietze (1981), because the author obviously forgot them.
With Mongolian closely related is the question of the language of the Avars, perhaps also of the Huns, Scythians, Medes, Parthians and other people, the origin of the Székely’s and generally the questions if the languages of these peoples are also of Sumerian origin and if there is thus a continuity of Hungarian presence in the Carpathian basin (cf. f. ex. Bobula 1966, spec. pp. 43ss.). We restrict ourselves in the present study first to the proof that Mongolian is very closely related to Hungarian and that both languages go back to Sumerian and second to show that Avaric was really – as already postulated by Pray (1774) and von Klaproth (1831) – Mongolian or perhaps better Proto-Mongolian.
The following map (copyright: University of Graz, Institute for Linguistics) displays the actual Mongolian territory:
Why did the Mongolians attack Hungary in the 13th century? Was it only because they were a people of warriors or is there a connection with the many attacks that the Turks did a few centuries later? The Mongolians conquered parts of China, the empires of the Choresmians, Tanguts, the biggest part of Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, in 1241 they reached Silesia and one year after even the Adria. The Turks, after having conquered the Hungarians 1526 in Mohács, even went until Vienna (cf. Weiers 2004). A short comparison between the Mongols and the Turks shows that they obviously tried to regain lands that their forefathers once possessed. This is clear from their mythologies in which they believed, since mythology played the role that history would play after. And the Carpathian basin belonged to the territory both of the Mongols and of the Turks because Mongols, Turks and Hungarians all originate from the Sumerians – as my extensive etymological lists in EDH-1 to EDH-4 as well as the work done by my “ancestors” clearly prove. In the following chapter, I will show the amazingly high number of shared cognates between Sumerian, Hungarian and Mongolian and in the subsequent chapter the common Sumerian-Hungarian-Avaric and Sumerian-Hungarian-Hunnic origin of the few words that we know from the Avars and the Huns.

Mongolian thus shares 559 of 1042 words of the basic word list taken from Gostony (1975) with Sumerian-Hungarian, i.e. 54%. In the hierarchy published f. ex. in EDH-4, Mongolian stands therefore between Turkish with 55% and Tibeto-Burman with ca. 50%. But the effective percentage of Sumerian-Hungarian-Mongolian cognates is even higher, as we will see in the next chapter.

3. Sumerian, Hungarian and Avaric
Although we have ca. 2’000 Avaric archeological sites and 50’000 graves (Pohl 1988, p. 13), we only have 13 Avaric names and 1 appellative (Moravcsik 1983, pp. 359, 363). The following map is showing the Avar Khaganate, ca. 650 AD (copyright: Wikipedia):
The question, to which language Avaric belonged, stayed thus controversial: Menges (1973, 1986) and Futaky (2001) are sure that they were Mongolians, while f. ex. Gombocz, Németh and Moravcsik himself claimed that they were Turks (Pohl 1988, p. 223). Now, Futaky proved that the following 41 Hungarian words came via the Avars from the Mongolians and the Manchu: beze/bezzeg, bízni, deber/deberke, diadalom, gangos, gárgyulni, genge/ gyenge, kebel, üldeni/üldözni, üstök (directly from Monglian); beteg, bukni, csatak, csupa, dédelni/dédelgetni, egerni/egercsélni, eszten(nap), gór, gyep/gyepű, hajdan, hamar, íj, isa, ítélni, kalán/kanál, koszorú, legelni, mancs, metni/metszeni/metélni, mind(en), nyáj, oldal, távészni, tékozni, tor/torolni/torló, zsombék (directly from Mandschu); elég/elegendő, gyere, ördög, telek (both from Mongolian and Manchu). The 4 words dalin/dalm, gyámolni, selyem and tung came from Chinese via Monglian and/or Mandchu mediation (the Silk Road went, as every Hungarian knows, through Hungary). Moreover, Futaky presents 2 place names and suspects many more of Avaric origin, basically in Western Hungary where he thinks that the Avars survived until the 9th century, thus proving an Avaric-Hungarian continuity in the Carpathian basin (2001, pp. 133ss.). Together with these 45 words – a few of them are part of Gostony’s 1042 words-list (cf. chapter 5 in EDH-1) -, Mongolian ranks even higher than Turkish in the hierarchy of SumerianHungarian genetical relationship. This is another hint for Sumerian-Hungarian-Avaric continuity.

4. Conclusions
We know from von Torma (1894), Bobula (1951), Vlassa (1963), Badiny (2001) and Tóth (2007a) that the Sumerians originated in Transylvania before they migrated to Mesopotamia, from where they spread out and a part of them went back in the Carpathian basin. The Sumerian-Hungarian geneticallinguistic relationship was proved in a long series of books and articles, last in EDH (Tóth 2007). The Huns were already considered to be Mongolians by Deguignes, Pallas and Bergmann (cf. Doerfer 1973, p. 13). The genial German orientalist Julius von Klaproth (Berlin 1783-Paris 1835) identified them directly with the Hungarians (Klaproth 1831), cf. also Moravcsik (1983, pp. 231ss.). Moreover, the Avars as well as the Scythians were already identified with the Huns by Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos in the 10th century, who also first mentioned the Magyars as “sabartoi asphaloi”, showing thus the genetical relationships of the Hungarians and the Mesopotamian Subaraens (Moravcsik 1983, pp. 53, 279). The Medes were stated as Scythians by the famous orientalist Friedrich Wilhelm König who showed also that they originated in the Zagros mountains in Mesopotamia (König 1934). Finally, that the Parthians were a Scythian people, is accepted by everybody today, cf. Colledge (1967) and was shown on Sumerian background by Badiny (1998, 1999).
From all these identifications it follows together with our proof presented here in EDH-5 that there is a genetical linguistic relationships of Sumerians, Huns, Avars, Scythians, Medes, Parthians and probably more people and a geographical continuity of Sumerians, Huns, Scythians and Avars in the Carpathian basin.
Of course, to such a conclusion one cannot come if one excludes possible other than “Altaic” language connections of Mongolian, Avaric and Hunnic and then wonders that one gets “unknown etymologies”. Typical of this kind of linguistic under-determination is Doerfer’s remark: “Offenbar sind also die hunnischen Namen nicht eindeutig als türkisch zu erklären, besser: Sie sind überhaupt nicht zu erklären, sie gehören einer unbekannten Sprache an” (Obviously, the Hunnic names thus cannot be explained by Turkish, or better: One cannot explain them at all, they belong to an unknown language).

1. Preface
“Etymological Dictionary of Hungarian” (EDH) and my two little volumes “Hungaro-Rhaetica” were and still are a huge success, unexpected even for me, since I never thought that until now already over 5’000 people would download them. My readers may thus ask why I present them now a new etymological dictionary of Hungarian. This has at least three good reasons:
First, EDH shows on approximately 1’500 pages Gostony’s 1’042 Hungarian words (“Dictionnaire d’étymologie sumérienne”, Paris 1975) in 18 language families with several dozens of languages around the world, ordered primarily according to the language families and only secondarily according to the 1’042 Hungarian-Sumerian cognates. The present dictionary, which I call “HMD”, shows 1’317 Hungarian-Mesopotamian (Sumerian, Akkadian, Rhaetic) words according to alphabetical order.
Second, Gostony’ dictionary as well as all hitherto published works on Sumerian-Hungarian, are based on outdated Sumerian dictionaries, the newest one being normally P. Anton Deimel’s “Šumerisches Lexikon” (Rome 1928ss.), but since this work is hardly available outside of libraries specialized in Assyriology, most of the Sumerian-Hungarian studies are based on Friedrich Delitzsch’s “Sumerisches Glossar” (1914) which represents the scientific level of Sumerology of the end of the 19th century. HDM is based of the Sumerian dictionary of the University of Pennsylvania which is accessible in the internet and constantly being updated.
Third, the only reliable and thus usable Sumerian-Hungarian language studies are the ones written by Ida Bobula, Sándor Csőke and Zsigmond Varga. Most of the other ones deserve the bad critics that they got, because almost each etymology is either debatable or wrong. This is one of the main reasons, why the Sumerian-Hungarian affinity, already early proposed, was never accepted by international scientists. All people who wrote Sumerian-Hungarian studies did it with best intentions – but at the end they rather damaged than helped this theory. Moreover, practically none of these works are based on sound-laws. The necessity of sound-laws and thus the right of existence of historical linguistics was even denied. HDM is based on sound-laws and presents a completely new etymological base for 1317 Hungarian words, keeping only those early Sumerian etymologies that can stand before the present state of Sumerian linguistics. HDM does not deny historical linguistics, but takes full consideration of the (Ugric, Finno-Ugric, Altaic, etc.) proto-forms that had been reconstructed by traditional historical linguists, confronts them with the possible Sumerian words and discusses divergences between Sumerian and Proto-X. Therefore, HDM does not intend to substitute traditional Hungarian etymological dictionaries, but enlarges their basis by confronting the abstract proto-forms with the concrete words of an extinct, but once living language.
I could have tried to explain more Hungarian words by Sumerian than I did. But with its 1317 entries, HMD can stand its concurrence at least in quantitative respect: “A Magyar Szókészlet finnugor elemei etimológiai szótár” contains ca. 677 and Budenz’ comparative dictionary 996 entries, concentrating only on such Hungarian words that show up at least in one other Uralic language. Since it was important to me to compare the actual Sumerian words with the reconstructed proto-forms, I restricted myself also basically only on such words, but enlarged my vocabulary from the Uralic to the Altaic language family, does presupposing that the once asserted Ural-Altaic macrofamily does exist. The other group of words I have chosen to try to explain in HMD are words that are still “of unknown origin”. In this case, HDM wants to open new ways by confronting such Hungarian words with possible Sumerian, Akkadian and Rhaetic cognates. On the other side, Bárczi’s “short” dictionary has apprioximately 8,500 entries, the big TESz has 10,714 entries and the newest, the “Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen (EWU)”, has ca. 10,000 entries, but these latter works include all possible derivations from the simple Hungarian stems. Since these derivations are accessible in each big Hungarian dictionary (and known to the Hungarian readers anyway), I also concentrated myself only on stems, which does not exclude that I also brought derivations, if their semantics has considerably changed from the original meaning(s) of the stems.

Unlike in EDH, I do not quote scientific literature in HDM (unless it is really necessary), because unlike EDH, HDM should become a reference work not only for linguists but for specialists of other disciplines and even interested people of each genre as well. For everybody who wants to check the used as well as further literature, I recommend the several bibliographies at the ends of the 18 chapters of EDH. Since it is very well known that Finno-Ugric etymologies change from dictionary to dictionary (even in such standard works that were written under participation of the same persons almost at the same times), I cite deviant proto-forms next to one another, separated by commata.
I like to thank my great teacher and best friend, Professor Dr. Linus Brunner (1909-1987), with whom I studied Assyriology and Semitistics and without his continued mental presence I would not have been able to write HDM. Special thanks go to Flórián Farkas who has already taken care of many studies of mine and has also done an excellent job in editing HDM.

2. Introduction
“GALILEI. Ich bin es gewohnt, die Herren aller Fakultäten sämtlichen Fakten und Entdeckungen gegenüber die Augen schliessen zu sehen und so zu tun, als sei nichts geschehen. Ich zeige meine Notierungen und man lächelt; ich stelle ein Fernrohr zur Verfügung, dass man sich überzeugen kann, und man zitiert den Aristoteles. Der Mann hatte kein Fernrohr!” (Bertolt Brecht, Leben des Galilei, Grosse Berliner und Frankfurter Ausgabe, Bd. 5, S. 39ff.)
Kisütik, hoy a magyar nyelv Nincs, nem is lesz, nem is volt, Ami új van benne, mind rossz, Ami régi, az tót. (Arany János, Orthológusokra, 1880)
A preamble about reconstruction
Critics of traditional historical linguistics are right, when they state that the method of reconstruction on which historical linguistics is based, is logically circular. You realize that two words in two different languages look similar, then you assume that not only these words, but also the languages to which they belong, may be related. You go on, and if you find enough word-parallels, you try to find a system of parenthood of the two languages in establishing sound-laws. And if you have succeeded in doing so, too, than you have “proven” that your two languages are related to one another, or more exactly: genetically related to one another. (Languages may be typologically, but not genetically related, e.g. Hungarian and Basque, or genetically, but not typologically related, e.g. Sanskrit and Hindi.) Therefore, to speak in terms of logic: Your assumption is: Languages A and B are related to one another. Your theorem is: Languages A and B are related to one another. And your conclusion is: Languages A and B are related to one another.
This is a classical circulus vitiosus. But first, logic does not apply in historical linguistics. Classical logic is mono-contextural, i.e. can only differentiate between two values: positive or negative, there is no “gray-scale” between these two logical values. Languages, however, are not structured according to such a light-switch logic, and neither is linguistics. Second, nobody can deny that e.g. English “house” and German “Haus” are one and the same word because the two languages to which they belong are relatives of one another like two sisters or brothers. And where there are children, there also must be parents, grandparents and so on. This leads directly to reconstruction and thus to historical linguistics: tracing back the children to their earliest possible ancestors. In linguistics, these ancestors are called proto-forms. Third, the critics have offered a synchronic instead of this diachronic (historical) method of reconstruction: Instead of tracing back words to their proto-forms, they want to isolate the stems of these words, then compare them to stems of other languages, and if they turn out to be identical, than the languages to which they belong, are identical, and if not, then they are not related. Here is to ask: How do these critics know what is stem and what are derivational formants (e.g. prefixes, infixes, suffixes)? And how do they know if two stems of two languages are not identical or similar by chance (e.g. Engl. “house” and Hung. ház, the latter one is related to Engl. “hut”, but not to “house”)?

However, I agree with these critics about circularity in historical linguistics insofar, as it is really circular first to reconstruct a proto-form (to which one needs already sound-laws) and then to “reconstruct” sound-laws from the proto-forms. But here there is a better solution than the synchronic comparison that turns out to be impossible, as just shown: After having reconstructed proto-forms one has the possibility to compare these abstract proto-forms with real words of living or extinct languages. There is only one problem: The languages one compares with one another should be from about the same time-depth. It makes no sense, if Indo-Europeanists compare, e.g., Albanian, which is not documented before the 15th century A.D., with Anatolian languages that are attested from the 18th century B.C., because in these 33 centuries that lie between these languages, many phonetical and semantical chances may have occured.
This is indeed an important point: One of the most important criticisms of traditional Finno-Ugrists against the Hungarian “Sumerologists” is telling them that it is not allowed to compare Hungarian, that is not testified before the 12th century, with Sumerian, whose earliest texts go back approximately to the 27th century B.C., thus 39 centuries lying between them. But if one combines the method of reconstruction and the method of confronting the reconstructed proto-forms with the actual words of the oldest known language at all, Sumerian, one gets in a situation similar to the reconstruction of the Romance languages’ sound-laws by confronting the words of the Romance languages with Latin, or in the case of the Slavonic languages with Old Bulgarian (Old Church Slavonic). What a kind of “Latin” would result, if one had to reconstruct it from the actual Romance languages? – One is for sure, not the Latin we know, and given the huge discrepancy in the Romance lexicon, the reconstructed “Latin” vocabulary would contain maximally a few hundred words and not the many ten thousands contained e.g. in the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae.
The dissolution of language families
Since we take the now late Dietz Otto Edzard’s criticism on Gostony’s “Dictionnaire d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975): “We cannot bridge 5’000 years’ distance simply by comparing two languages”, i.e. Hungarian and Sumerian, seriousely, we want to show, why our method to use reconstructed proto-forms as intermediaries between modern Hungarian and Sumerian words really works. We thus give here an overview about the time-depths of the language families we are concerned in HMD and their dissolution (Ausgliederung) into single languages (all dates are, of course, approximate, but officially accepted).
Nostratic (Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Altaic, Proto-Uralic, Proto-Yukaghir, Proto-ChukotkoKamtchatkan, Proto-Eskimo-Aleut, Proto-Kartvelian, Proto-Dravidian, Proto-Afro-Asiatic [formerly called Hamito-Semitic], Proto-Niwkh, Prot-Elamite, Tyrsenian, Sumerian): 18’000-12’000 B.C.
Proto-Uralo-Siberian (Proto-Uralo-Yukagir, Proto-Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Proto-Eskimo-Aleut):
6000-4000 B.C.
Proto-Altaic (Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolian, Proto-Tungusic) 6000 B.C.
Proto-Uralic (Proto-Finno-Ugric, Proto-Samoyed):
6000/4000 B.C.

Proto-Finno-Ugric (Proto-Finno-Permic, Proto-Ugric): 2500 B.C.
Proto-Ugric (Proto-Hungarian, Proto-Obugric):
1500 B.C.
Since our oldest readable Sumerian texts are from the so-called Fāra period, i.e. from the 27th century B.C., Sumerian is almost contemporaneous to Proto-Finno-Ugric. Since Akkadian, precisely Old Babylonian, is testified from the 23rd century B.C. (Sargon of Akkad) and since the same is true for his close relative, Rhaetic (cf. Brunner and Tóth 1987)1, these languages are also contemporaneous with both Sumerian and Proto-Finno-Ugric. Since our hypothesis is that Hungarian goes back to Sumerian, the objection that we do not have older Sumerian texts, is of no importance (no Indo-Europeanist is forced to go further back from Proto-Indo-European to Nostratic). It is of no importance either, that “we see Sumerian only through the glasses of Akkadian”, i.e. possibly distorted by Akkadian phonetics, as Edzard (2003) remarked, because no linguist would deal with Sumerian if it would be worthless because of this possible distortion. And what concerns the further comparison of Hungarian via ProtoUgric, Proto-Finno-Ugric and Proto-Uralic with Proto-Altaic, there is no problem either, because in these cases we compare proto-forms with proto-forms, i.e. reconstructions that have already been approved by traditional linguists.
The following etymological part of the present book will show entry by entry how the Sumerian phonemes correspond to the phonemes of the proto-languages on the one side and to the phonemes of Hungarian on the other side. Generally, it is to say that there is much more deviance between Hungarian and Proto-Ugric than between Hungarian and Sumerian. The main reason is that FinnoUgrists tend to prefer Vogul (Mansi) and Ostyak (Khanty) forms if they deviate from Hungarian, and since it seems that the Ob-Ugric languages are not or not directly related to Hungarian, the result is in many cases a Proto-Ugric form that does not fit to the Hungarian word and thus ad hoc sound-laws in order to urge the Hungarian form in the Vogul-Ostyak Procrustes bed. On the other side, if a reconstruction is not or not primarily based on Hungarian and Vogul and/or Ostyak, but also at least on one Finno-Permic form, than the reconstructed proto-form is always much closer to the Sumerian word. It can also generally be observed that the Sumerian and the Hungarian consonants fit much better to one another than the vowels of both languages do, most of all the velar vowels. The reason is clear: Sumerian, Akkadian and Rhaetic do not possess a phonem /o/, so a Hungarian dark vowel can originate in a Sumerian, Akkadian or Rhaetic /a/ or /u/. Generally, again, Sumerian fits in his vowels system better to Hungarian than Akkadian and Rhaetic do, because in Sumerian, but not in Akkadian and Rhaetic (because of their apophony) there are traces of vowel harmony that are, as well known, fully developed in Hungarian.
And once again generally: By comparing modern Hungarian words with Sumerian, Akkadian and Rhaetic words from Old Babylonian time via intermediary reconstructed proto-forms, one realizes that not the phonetical but the semantical part of reconstruction or comparison is the big problem. Traditional linguists who reconstruct proto-forms from modern forms tacitly assume that the older a word is traced back, the simpler its meaning must be. But Sumerian shows quite the opposite. In most cases it is like that: The older a word is, there more specific (and not general) a meaning of a word gets. Phylogenetically, the concrete item is primordial, the abstract one comes later. For example, the Hungarian word for “ham from a pig’s back”: top originates in Sumerian dub whose meaning is “knee” (because both the back and the knee are rounded). Yet, the reconstructed Proto-Finno-Ugric form *tuppз gives as meaning “loin” which is more abstract than “ham” or “knee/back”.
1 As I have already pointed out in the Preface, for bibliographical information I refer to my “Etymological Dictionary of Hungarian” (EDH).

A problem that I have to mention specially is that it is practically not to decide, if a Hungarian suffix, like e.g. the causative –t-, has its corresponding counterpart in a Sumerian suffix, particle or an own word. Thus, it is in most cases unclear, if a Hungarian suffix developed only in Hungarian, in one of the proto-languages or already in Sumerian. However, the many double-words that are already present in Sumerian and are highly developed in Hungarian (the so-called tükörszók) seem to point in the direction that generally Hungarian suffixes originate in Sumerian words and not in suffixes or particles. But here there is the other problem that we have no right to combine freely Sumerian words as etymological basis for Hungarian words unless they are really testified in Sumerian. For example, I accepted Badiny’s reconstruction of “Magyar” form Sumerian mah “(to be) great” + gar “(to be) heroic”, but strictly speaking, the word-combination *mah-gar is not testified in Sumerian, while e.g. igi-bad “to open the eyes (igi “eye)”, igi-bar “to look at”, igi-duh “to see” etc. are testified. Yet, o the other side, one may remark that in Romance linguistics, asterisk-forms are reconstructed where there is no corresponding actually testified Latin (or pre-Roman) word. For example, French soleil “sun” cannot originate in Latin sol “sun” (like e.g. Italian sole does), but presupposes a reconstructed diminutive form *solic(u)lu, and Buchenstein sorógle “sun” requires even a reconstruct of the already reconstructed diminutive: *soluc(u)lu). However, the etymology of “Magyar” (that must not lack in a Hungarian etymological dictionary) is the one and only case where I was inconsistent.

Akkadian kam(m)ūnum “caraway”. The Akk. and Rhaet. word is also the basis for Engl. cumin that is phonetically, but not semantically identical with Germ. Kümmel “caraway”. Engl. cumin is “Kreuzkümmel” (lit. “cross-cumin”) in Germ., and “caraway” < Old Spanish alcarahuaya < Arabic al-karawiya < Greek káron “caraway”. But if EWU (p. 816) calls words like this “Wanderwörter” (migrating words), then it is to say that not the words wander, but the people who bring these words with them. Wanderwörter are thus proofs of migrations, in this case of the Sumerians and the Rhaetians.

Hungarian öv (< ő) “belt” Proto-Uralic (?), Proto-Finno-Ugric *wiŋä, *wüŋgä “belt, girdle” Finnish vyö “waist” Lappish āvve “belt, girdle” Komi võń “band, belt, girdle, sash” Enec bine “line, strap, thong” Kamassian minä “halter, rein” Nenec jiine “cord, line, rein, rope, strap, wire” Nganasan bene “line, strap, thong” Selqup üüni “id.” Sumerian niĝin (214x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. niĝin2; niĝin “to encircle; to go around”, ib (36x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ib2 “hips; middle”. The PFU form is only based on Komi, which shows a stem in –n that otherwise occurs in Samoyed languages only. Thus, PFU *wiŋä, *wüŋgä are wrong, the Komi word is a borrowing, and Sum. ib2 is the basis of the Hung., Finn. and Lapp. words, while Sum. niĝin is the basis of the Komi and Samoyed forms. Therefore, the Samoyed words are not related to the FU words.
Hungarian özön “deluge, flood, stream, torrent”

Hungarian -p (momentaneous suffix, e.g. állap- “to stop” [15th c.], cf. állapot “situation, condition, state”, állni “to stand”) Proto-Ugric *-ppV Sumerian šuba “apart from” (cf. Edzard 2003, p. 159) Akkadian ezib, ezub
Hungarian pajtás “bud, chum, companion, comrade, fellow, mate, pal” Akkadian bītu, bētu “house” Rhaetic *beita “hut” (Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 97). According to EWU, p. 1097s. borrowed from Osman paydaş “comrade, person involved”. According to our etymology the meaning is “one who shares the house with sb., familiar” and proves that initial Hung. p- can be inherited, either from b- or from p (v.s.).
Hungarian panasz “order”, panaszkodik “to complain”
Rhaetic pna- “to ask/contact sb.” (Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 98)
Hungarian papucs “slippers” Turkish pabuç “shoe” Sumerian upap (1x: ED IIIa) wr. uz-pap “a bird”. Cf. Swiss Germ. “Finken” = Eng. “finches”, i.e. the bird and the slippers have the same name. Alternatively to Sum. pag (2x: Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian) wr. pag “to enclose, confine, cage (a bird)” (inherited Hung. p-).

Proto-Uralic *parз, *porз “group, mass, pile” Komi, Udmurt pur “raft” Sumerian bur, wr. ĝešbur “a tree” (inherited Hung. p-).
Hungarian pára “steam; haze, mist; fog”, párolni “to stew, to steam”
Sumerian muru (21x: Old Babylonian) wr. muru9; muru3 “rainstorm; mist; drizzle”, baršeĝ (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. bar-šeĝ3 “fog”. If the latter etymology is right, then we have another proof for inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 114: borrowed from a Slavonic language).
Hungarian paskolni “to clap, to slap, to hit”
Sumerian pašu (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. pa-a-šu "type of axe". Inherited Hung. p(EWU, p. 1123: onomatopoetic).
Hungarian patak “brook”
Sumerian pu (95x: ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. pu2 “well; fish pond; source (of river)” + tag4 “to open” (Oberhuber 1990, p. 465). Inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 1129: borowed from a Slavonic language).
Hungarian peregni “to move in a circle, to rate” Proto-Altaic *p’erkV “to tie around, to surround” Proto-Mongolic *hergiProto-Tungusic *perkeProto-Uralic (?), Proto-Finno-Ugric *pire(-), pirä(-) “circle, ring; to enclose, to surround” Sumerian bir (37x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. bir; bi-bi-re; bir9 “to scatter, disperse”. Inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 1145: onomatopoetic).
Hungarian perem “edge, rim, margin, seam” Proto-Altaic *p’èrì “edge” Sumerian bar (2579x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. bar; ba-ra; bala; bur “outside, (other) side; behind; outer form, outer; fleece; outsider, strange; back, shoulder; liver; because of; to set aside; to cut open, slit, split”. Without doubt also related is Sum. par (130x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pa5; pa6 “(small) canal, irrigation ditch” (cf. the name of the river Ó-Perint in Vas megye). The etymology given by EWU, p. 1145 (Germ. Bräme “seam”) is thus mistaken, and we have another proof for inherited Hung. p-.
Hungarian pír “flush of dusk; red colour”, pirítani “to toast, to roast”, piros “red” Proto-Altaic *p’òre “fire; to burn” Proto-Turkic *ört Proto-Mongolic *(h)örde. Proto-Tungusic *puri-/piriSumerian bir9 “to blow; to flame up” (Oberhuber 1990, p. 59). Inherited Hung. p-. When EWU (p. 1165: onomatopoetic) keeps denying the existence of inherited Hung. p-, then the Proto-forms cited above at least prove that also “onomatopoetic” words can be inherited, which implies also the inheritance of Hung. p-. But as the Proto-forms with concrete, non-onomatopoetic meanings prove by themselves, this word-family is not onomatopoetic, either.

Hungarian pohár “glass, tankard”
Sumerian pihu, wr. dugpi-hu; dugpihu; dugpihu2; dugpihu3; dugpihu4; dugpihu5; dug|NUNUZ.AB2×IGI@g| “a beer jar”. Inherited Hung. p- (EWU, p. 1179: borrowed from Old Bavarian pehhari, German Becher “tumbler, mug”). The problem with the EWU’s etymology is why Germ. b- changed in Hung. p-, while it did not e.g. in the case of Hung. boglár “clasp, buckle” which is borrwed according to EWU (p. 116) from Middle High German buckelaere. EWU (loc. cit.) gives as alternative a borrowing of pohár from High German, but then p- cannot be explained because only Old Bavarian b- > p- from the beginning of the 8th c. and most of all at this late time vowel harmony did not apply anymore (e.g. pantofli “slippers”).
Hungarian ponk “hillock, little hill”
Sumerian bun (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. uzubun; uzubun2 “bladder”. Inherited p-.
Hungarian por “dust; powder”
Proto-Altaic *bóru “dust; smoke; whirlwind” Sumerian bur (176x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, uncertain) wr. bur2; bur “to release, free; to reveal; to spread out, cover”. Inherited p-.
Hungarian pót “substitute; extra; “nectarium” (Cuczor-Fogarasi, p. 2566)
Sumerian pu (6x: Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. pu2 “fruit orchard”. Inherited Hung. p(EWU, p. 1194: “unknown origin”).
Hungarian pödörni “to twirl, to twist”
Sumerian dub (30x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dab6; dub “to go around, encircle, turn; to search; to tarry”. Metathesis dub > *bud > pödlike in Hung. pökni vs. köpni “to spit”? (EWU, p. 1198: “probably onomatopoetic”.)
Hungarian pökni, köpni “to spit”
Sumerian uhpu (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. uh2-pu2 “foam”. EWU, p. 819, s.v. “köp”: “onomatopoetic”; pök- is lacking.
Hungarian puszi “kiss, peck” Turkish buse Uzbek bösa Sumerian sub (126x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. su-ub; sub; sub6 “to suck; to rub” with metathesis like in pödörni and pökni. The assertion of EWU (p. 1219: borrwoing form Austrian German Busserl “(little) kiss” is thus not for sure, since German could have borrowed this word from Hung., and the Hung. word that is shared by words from Altaic languages has a Sum. origin. Other words for “kiss; to kiss” like Latin basium are also of “unknown origin” (Walde 1910, p. 84).
Hungarian -r (denominative noun suffix, e.g. odor “hollow cave, pit”, odú “cavity, den, hole”)
Proto-Uralic *-r (denominative noun formant of unknwon function) Sumerian -ri (affixed particle occurring after nominalized verbal forms ending in –a, cf. Edzard 2003, p. 160)

Hungarian reg, reggel “morning”, rég “long ago”, régi “old”, rögtön “immediately” Proto-Finno-Ugric *reŋkз “hot, warm” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru "to lay down, cast, place; to throw down; to release, let go; to imbue; to pour out; to lead away". The Sum. etymology clearly shows that the original meaning of the Hung. word family is “old”, not “hot”: The morning releases the old day, imbues it (to which the night also belongs).
Hungarian rejteni “to hide, to conceal”, rejlik “to be hidden”
Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, cast, place; to set in place; to lead away”. The original meaning of Sum. ri is “to remove, to sweep away” and then “to hide”. “to sweep away” developed to “to graze” in Akk. and Rhaet., where we find re’ū “to graze; shepherd”, in which the meaning of the supervisor of the grazing animals is thus included. The feminine form of re’ū, rē’ītu “shepherdess”, became the name of the highest goddess of the Rhaetians who got their name for her which appears in Rhaetic inscriptions as Reitu and Ritu (cf. Brunner and Tóth 1987; Tóth and Brunner 2007). Therefore, while rej-l-ik goes directly back to Sum., rej-t-eni must either originate in Rhaet. rē’īt-, or the “causative suffix” was – like the verbal derivative suffix –l-, already present in Sum.
Hungarian rém “apparition, ghost”, rémálom “nightmare”, rémíteni “to frighten” Sumerian erim2 “fiend” (Oberhuber 1990, p. 147)
Hungarian repedni “to crack, to burst”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *r8ppз-, *reppз- “to burst, to rend, to split” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to throw down”; cf. also: Akkadian rapāsum “to be cracked, burst”
Hungarian repíteni “to sling, to throw”, repülni “to fly (itr.)” Proto-Finno-Ugric *r8ppз- “to beat with the wings, to fly” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, cast, place; to set in place, imbue; to lean on; to impose; to throw down; to release, let go; to walk along; to pour out; to lead away”
Hungarian rés “fissure; hole, opening” Proto-Finno-Ugric *raćз “hole” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to throw down; to pour out”
Hungarian rész “part, piece, section” Proto-Finno-Ugric *räćз “piece” Sumerian ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, to cast, to set in place; to lean on”

Hungarian révület “ecstasy, trance” Proto-Uralic (?), Proto-Ugric *rekз, *reŋз Sumerian rib (62x: ED IIIb, Old Babylonian) wr. rib; ri-ba “(to be) surpassing, outstanding; (to be) strong, massive”. The root-enlarging elements –k and –ŋ are based solely on the Mańśi forms rèγ and rei and are mistaken in view of the Hung. form ending on –v < -b. Thus, révület is phonetically related with ravasz “sly” to which it also belongs semantically.
Hungarian rezegni “to quiver, to shake, to tremble” Proto-Finno-Ugric *reńćз-, *rećз- “to quake, to shake” Sumerian zir (373x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. zi; ziir; ze2-er “to tear out; to break, destroy; to be troubled; to erase”.

Proto-Finno-Ugric *rokз-, *roγз-, *rowз- “to cut, to notch” Sumerian hur (44x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. hur “to scratch, draw”

EWU, p. 1275) Finnish repo Sumerian rib (62x: ED IIIb, Old Babylonian) wr. rib; ri-ba “(to be) surpassing, outstanding; (to be) strong, massive” + -ga (derivative suffix of unknown meaning, possibly also diminutive), cf. ab2 “cow”, ab2-ga “milk; cow”
Hungarian rokkanni “to descend continuously closer”, rokkant “crippled, disabled; invalid”
Proto-Ugric *r8kkз- “to collapse, to fall down” Sumerian ru, ri (475x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. RI; ru “to lay down, cast, place; to set in place, imbue; to lean on; to impose; to throw down; to release, let go; to walk along; to pour out; to lead away”

Hungarian sajt “cheese”
Akkadian (?) eqīdu “Käse”. Possible phonological development: eqīdu > *ešīdu > *šīdu > šayt = Hung. sajt. The only attested Rhaetic word for cheese was kaššu “massive, bulky” (Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 67), which is also the basis for English “cheese” and German “Käse”.

Hungarian süly “scurvy; tumor” Proto-Altaic *si_òge “wart” Proto-Turkic *sigöl, *sögil Proto-Mongolic *söγel Proto-Tungusic *sogiProto-Uralic *ćiklä, *ćüklä, *ćikl’ä, *ćüklä “wart” Karelian süglä “wart” Sumerian asag (23x: Ur III) wr. a2-sag3 “a demon; a disease” Akkadian asakku
Hungarian süppedni “to give way, to sink, to subside” Proto-Ugric *čeppз- “to drown, to sink, to submerge” Sumerian šab (25x: Old Babylonian) wr. šab “to become loose, fall out; to disintegrate; to disappear”
Hungarian sűrű “close, compact, dense, thick”
Sumerian sir (11x: Old Babylonian) wr. sir2 “(to be) dense”

Hungarian sütni “to bake, to broil; to shine (sun)”; sülni “to be baked, to be boiled” Proto-Ugric *čittз- “to bake, to broil; to shine” Sumerian zil (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. zil “to boil”. So, sülni and not sütni (as assumed by EWU, p. 1375) is the basic word, sütni is derived with the usual causative suffix –t-, while the –l belongs to the root, as the Sum. form shows. Thus, the problem with –tt- > -t- as well as the explication of the –l- in sülni as analogy given by EWU are mistaken, and so is the PU form.
Hungarian süv “uncle; brother-in-law”
Sumerian ušbar (19x: ED IIIa, Old Babylonian) wr. ušbar; ušbar3; ušbar2 "father-in-law; mother-in-law"

Hungarian száguldani “to run at full speed, to rush” Proto-Ugric *ś8ŋз- “to flee, to gallop, to jump” Sumerian saĝgul (28x: ED IIIb, Ur III) wr. sag-kul; saĝ-gul “globe-lightning”. According to EWU (pp. 180s.), -uld is a suffix, but the Sum. form clearly shows that only –d- is a suffix, wile –ul belongs to the second syllable. The semantic connection between “to run” and “lightning” is given by the Hung. saying: “Megy, mint a villámlás = száguld, vágtat” (O. Nagy Gábor, Magyar szólások és közmondások. 8th ed. Budapest 1999, p. 725, no. 495) that originates in Sum., as the following example proves: “The sixth beats at the flanks of the mountains like a battering flood. The seventh flashes like lightning, and no one can deflect its power” (Gilgameš and Huwawa [Version B]: c.1.8.1.5.1). This etymology is an incontestable proof for the genetical relationship between Hungarian und Sumerian.
Hungarian szak “age, era, period; branch, profession, subject; division, part, section; stanza, strophe, verse” Proto-(Finno?-)Ugric *śakkз, *śukkз “piece” Sumerian saĝ ĝal (39x: Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. saĝ ĝal2 “(to be) measured out as a heaped amount; to measure out a heaped amount”

Hungarian szarv, szaru “horn (of an animal)” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śorwa Sumerian si (262x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. si “horn; finger; fret”
Hungarian szatócs “merchant”

Hungarian száz “hundred” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śata Sumerian sud (488x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. sud; su3-ud “(to be) distant; (to be) remote, long-lasting” or kud (1111x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium, unknown) wr. kud; gur5 “to break off, to cut off; to cut”. PFU *śata is believed to be either a very early borrowing or genetically related to Proto-IE *dek'om, *dek'em-; *(d)k'em-t-o-, the development of the initial consonants of which have lead to differentiate the IE languages in a centum and a satem group. Since in Sum. we have a cognate with inital s- and one with initial k-, the question arises, if the PFU form *śata is correct or not and if the words for “100” in PFU and PIE are related or not. Given the fact that in the Sumerian sexagesimal number system there was no word for “100”, both sud and kud are semantically possible.
Hungarian szedni “to collect, to gather, to pick, to pluck” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śentä “to pluck, to rip, to tear” Sumerian sig (48x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. sig7; sig8 “to pluck hair or wool; (to be) trimmed, pruned”

Hungarian szégyelleni “to be/feel ashamed”, szégyen “shame, discredit, dishonour, disgrace, scandal”
Sumerian azag (6x: Old Babylonian) wr. azag “taboo, forbidden thing” Akkadian asakku
Hungarian szék “seat, stool, chair; egg-yolk”
Sumerian zig (8574x: Lagash II, Ur III) wr. zig3 “to issue; to levy, raise, muster; to swell; to expend; to rise”, or zig, wr. zigx(|PA.GI|) "town, center". According to EWU, p. 1406, szék “egg-yolk” has nothing to do with the other word szék and is “of unknown origin”. The Sumerian etymology presented here, however, shows that starting form a basic meaning “to rise”, both words are one and the same.
Hungarian székely “Székely (member of an own ethnic Magyar group inhabiting central Transylvania and supposedly descendants of the Huns)
Sumerian zag (902x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. zag “side; border, boundary, district; limit; right side, the right”. According to EWU (p. 1407), the word is “of unknown origin”, although already the Hung. tradition calls them clearly “border-people”, left once as Eastern outpost of historical Hungary.
Hungarian szekér “cart, wagon”
Proto-Ugric *säkзrз “a kind of vehicle” Sumerian zig (8574x: Lagash II, Ur III) wr. zig3 “to issue; to levy, raise, muster; to swell; to expend; to rise” + hara, wr. harax(|NUNUZ.AB2×BI|) “a part of a wagon”. Since in Sum. “the rising” one is associated with “seat”, szekér means a wagon with a seat.
Hungarian szelni “to slice”, szelet “slice; part; schnitzel” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śälä-, *čälä- “to cut” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”
Hungarian szél “edge”, széles “wide, broad” Proto-Ugric *śelз “edge, rim” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”
Hungarian szél, szel- “wind”
Sumerian til (770x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. til3 “to live”. Semantically, we have here the connection of “to breathe, to live” with “to blow; breath, wind”, cf. Greek ánemos “breath, wind”, Latin animus “mind”, Greek pneîn “to blow”, pneūma “breath, wind” > “mind, soul of the world”.
Hungarian szem “eye” Proto-Uralic *śilmä Sumerian sim (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. sim; si-im “to sieve, filter”

Proto-Finno-Ugric *śine “charcoal”, *ś8ne “tinder” Sumerian šeĝ (261x: ED IIIa, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. šeĝ6 “to cook; to fire (pottery)”
Hungarian szép “beautiful, handsome, pretty” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śeppä “clever” Sumerian šab (25x: Old Babylonian) wr. šab “to trim; to make clear”. Since a participle in the sense of inflectional languages does not exist in Sumerian (non-finite verbal forms lack prefixes and suffixes, cf. Edzard 2003, p. 130), šab means also “trimmed, made clear” and thus “beautiful”.
Hungarian szeplő “freckle”
Sumerian zib (16x: ED IIIb, Ur III) wr. za3; zib “a mark; mark, token; colour, paint”
Hungarian szer “instrument, appliance; material, means; order, succession”, -szer/szor/-ször “... times”

Hungarian szidni “to scold”, szitkozódik
Proto-Finno-Volgaic *śoδa(-), *śoδ’a(-), śota(-) “battle, strife, war; to battle, to fight” Sumerian šud (115x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. šud3; šu-tu; šudx(|KA.ŠU|) “prayer, dedication; blessing”. Semantically, cf. Latin sacer “holy; damned”
Hungarian szíj “strap”
Proto-Uralic *ś8wз “draught-cord” Sumerian sa (68x: Old Babylonian) wr. sa “gut; sinew, tendon; string”
Hungarian szik “natron, alkali” Proto-Ugric *ć8kkз “salt” Sumerian sig (343x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium) wr. sig “(to be) weak; (to be) low; (to be) thin; (to be) narrow”. “weak” concerning the soil means dry, and natron-soil is dry, which makes the etymological connection to aszik, aszú (v.s.). Thus, the meaning of the PU form is wrong.

Hungarian szil “elm” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śala Finnish salava “brittle willow” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”. Sum. sil may also be the origin of Germ. Sal-weide “a kind of willow, Salix caprea”, which is of uncertain etymology (cf. Kluge 2002, p. 783), because to be brittle is a characteristic of willows (but not of the Salix caprea who thus must have gotten its denomination by analogy from other types of willows).
Hungarian szilni “to chop, to cut, to plane, to slice” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śale- “to splice, to split” Sumerian sil (119x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. si-il; zil; silx(|EZEN×LAL2|); sil5 “(to be) remote; to split apart; to split, slit”

Hungarian szirt “cliff, ledge, rock”
Sumerian sir, wr. sir5 “(to be) pointed”
Hungarian szív “heart”
Proto-Uralic *śiδä(-mз), *śüδä(-mз) Sumerian sub (126x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. su-ub; sub; sub6 “to suck”. The heart not as “pumping”, but as sucking organ. The PU form with –δ- is solely based on Finn. sydän, Lapp. čāδâ and Mordv. sedej, sedeńg, while all other FU reflexes show –m-, -l- or –j-. Given the Sum. etymology, the Finn., Lapp. and Mordv. words do not belong here and the PU form is thus mistaken.
Hungarian szívni “to suck”
Proto-Altaic *šimi “to suck; to soak” Sumerian sub (126x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. su-ub; sub; sub6 “to suck”. The etymological connection, denied by EWU, p. 1441, is shown clearly not only by our Sum., but also by the PA etymology.
Hungarian szó “word” Proto-Altaic *sāba “sign” Proto-Ugric *sawз Sumerian sa (46x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. sa2 “to advice, to counsel”, or zib (16x: ED IIIb, Ur III) wr. za3; zib “a mark; mark, token; colour, paint”, perhaps a contamination of both words, not unusual in Sum.

Hungarian szorgalom “diligence, industry, zeal”, szorgalmas “diligent, industrious”
Proto-Ugric *sarз “fast, quick” Sumerian sar (68x: Old Babylonian) wr. sar “to run, hasten”. Semantically, to run in order to be punctually at a certain place, thus “diligent”.
Hungarian szórítani “to force, to urge, to restrict; to hurt, to pinch”, szoros “narrow, tight, dense; mountain pass”, szorulni “to become narrow; to be jammed, to be stuck”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *śorз(-) “tight; to become tight” Sumerian sur (69x: ED IIIb, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. sur; sur8 “to press, squeeze”
Hungarian szőni, szöv- “to weave; to plot, to spin” Proto-Finno-Ugric *śäŋз(-) “to spin, to weave; hair” Sumerian sig (48x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. sig7; sig8 “to pluck hair or wool”, siki (4753x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. siki “wool, fleece; hair; (animal's) pelt” Akkadian šīpātum “wool”. Since the Akk., Rhaet. word with it enlarged root must be a borrowing from Sum., Sum. -g, -k- > Akk., Rhaet. –p- > Hung. –v-, so that the PFU form with its –ŋ- is mistaken (it is strange anyway, since a nasal doesn’t occur in any Uralic word). Moreover, the Hung. word, as the phonetical development shows clearly, must have come from the Rhaetians and not directly from the Sumerians.
Hungarian sző, szőke “blond” Proto-Altaic *šàŋu “clear, light” Proto-Turkic *čaŋ Proto-Mongolic *čaŋ Proto-Tungusic *sā(ŋ) Proto-Ugric *säŋз “bright, clear, light” Sumerian sig (8x: Old Babylonian) wr. si-ig “clear”

Semantically, we have “to rise” > “to go out”, which may include the meaning of “threshold” (“to go out” = “to walk over the threshold”). The two Sum. words zig “to go out” and zig “threshold” may even be one and the same, cf. in German Schwelle “threshold” and schwellen “to swell” (connection denied by Kluge 2002, p. 833).

Hungarian tanítani “to teach”, tanulni “to learn” Proto-Altaic *t’uŋe- “to inform” Proto-Uralic *tuna- “to accustom oneself, to learn” Sumerian du (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. du8 “to heap up, pile up”, dub (107x: ED IIIb, Old Babylonian) wr. dub “to heap up, to pile”, tub (29x: Old Akkadian, Old Babylonian) wr. tu11; tu10 “to heap up” + na (411x: ED IIIb, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. na “(compound verb nominal element)”. Obviously, the original meaning is “to heap up knowledge” (in Proto-Altaic, there was for sure no word for “to inform”!).
Hungarian tántorogni, tántorodik “to stagger, to sway”
Sumerian dun (17x: Old Babylonian) wr. dun5 “to roam around; to rock, churn”

Hungarian tarhonya “granulated dried pastry made of flour and eggs, ‘egg-barley’” Turkish tarhana “a kind of soup made of flour and milk” Sumerian tar (237x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tar; tarar “to cut down; to untie, loosen; to cut; to scatter, disperse; to decide” + kana (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. kana6; kana5; kana3 “(to be) dark”. The Tarhonya dough is traditionally pressed through/cut by a special sieve in order to get the “egg-barleys” (so the American name, derived from Austrian German “Eiergerstel”: Germ. Gerste “barley”). After the tarhonya are dry, they are roasted (“darkened”) in lard. Our etymology thus shows that the pastry is primary and the soup secondary. Therefore, the Hung. word cannot be borrowed (as usually assumed; cf. EWU, p. 1484) from the Turkish word, but the Turkish word is borrowed from the Hung., which explains that the two words are phonetically almost identical. Both words, however, go back to Sumerian.
Hungarian tarja “spare rib” Proto-Finno-Ugric *turja Sumerian dirig (2166x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. diri; RI “(to be) big, huge; on, over, above; to build high”. Same etymology as taraj (v.s.), but with already Sum. metathesis dirig > *dirgi > tarja. The spare rib is taken from the neck part of the animal, thus from there where the “crest” is (cf. German Kamm “crest; spare rib”).
Hungarian tar, tarka “multi-coloured; mottled”
Kazakh tarlan “reddish-yellow or black spotted white (of horses)” Sumerian dara (43x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dara4 “(to be) red; (to be) brown”

Hungarian tartani “to hold, to keep” Proto-Altaic *terta- “to pull” Proto-Turkic *dartProto-Mongolic *tata- < *dataProto-Tungusic *derdeProto-Finno-Ugric *tarttз- “to get stuck, to stick” Sumerian dara (2x: Old Babylonian) wr. tug2dara4; dara2; tug2dara2 “belt, sash, girdle; string”
Hungarian tat, tatfa “crossrail (in a ship); poop, stern” (fa “tree; wood”) Proto-Uralic *tuktз “crossrail” Sumerian tug (54x: ED IIIb) wr. tugx(LAK483) “a kind of plow?”
Hungarian tathal “tench (Tinca tinca)” (hal “fish”) Proto-Uralic *totke Sumerian tug (54x: ED IIIb) wr. tugx(LAK483) “a kind of plow?”. The tail of the tench has a high stalk with a fin that ends even and thus resembles to the knive of a plow or a crossrail.

Hungarian tavaly “last year”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *to “that” + *oδe, *ōδe “year” Sumerian -da (comitative suffix) + ud (29106x: Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ud “day; summer”. This etymology is not appropriate first because reflexes of PFU *oδe, *ōδe “year” do not exist otherwise in Hung., since év “year” < PFU *jikä, *ikä, and second because the stem of the word denoting “far, away” is not *to- nor *ta-, but tav-, so tavaly has to be separated in tav-aly and not in tavaly as stated in UEW (p. 335, supported by Komi vo “year” and Udmurt va “life”). Therefore, the etymology proposed here is: tab (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. tab “begin” + ul (161x: ED IIIb, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ul; ul-li2; ul-li “(to be) distant (in time); distant time”.
Hungarian tavasz “spring” Proto-Finno-Ugric *towkз Sumerian tab (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. tab “begin”
Hungarian távol “far”, tova “away”, túl “beyond” Proto-Uralic *to “that” Sumerian dub (30x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dab6; dub “to go around, encircle, turn; to search; to tarry”. EWU (p. 1537) explains –v- as “Hiatustilger” which is ad hoc; as the Sum. word shows, it belongs to the stem.
Hungarian te “thou, you” Proto-Altaic *si “thou” Proto-Uralic *t8 “you (here)”, *to “you (there)” Sumerian za-e, zé (contracted) “you”
Hungarian tegezni “to shoot with arrows” Proto-Altaic *t’úŋgi- “to quiver” Proto-Ugric *täŋ-tз- “id.” Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to attack”. The phonetically identical verb Hung. tegezni “to address sb. in the informal way (German: duzen)” and its counterpart magázni “to address sb. in the formal way (Germ.: siezen)” are built of the basis of te “thou” and maga “you (formal)”, whereby the derivational suffix az/-ez is probably formed according to Germ. –z- (du-z-en, sie-z-en, lit. “to say ‘thou’ (to sb.); to say ‘you’ (to sb.)”.
Hungarian tekerni “to twist, to wind”
Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to bind”
Hungarian tekinteni “to look, to watch; to regard as” Proto-Ugric *täkkз- “to notice, to observe” Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to touch, take hold of; to bind; to attack”
Hungarian teknő “trough”
Sumerian dug (3196x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. dug; dugx(BI) “(clay) pot; a unit of liquid capacity”

Hungarian tél “winter” Proto-Finno-Ugric *tälwä Sumerian til (627x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. til; til3 “(to be) complete(d); (to be) old, longlasting; to end”

Proto-Finno-Ugric *täwδe, *tälkз “full” Sumerian til (770x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. til3 “to live; to sit (down); to dwell”. The PFU etymology is semantically highly improbable.
Hungarian temetni “to bury”, temető “cemetery”
Sumerian dim, wr. dim3 “corpse”. EWU (p. 1500) derives temetni from tömni “to stuff” with causative suffix –et, which is semantically senseless. Probably Hung. tetem “corpse” is related to Sum. dim, too.
Hungarian tengely “axle; spindle”
Sumerian dimgal (11x: Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dim-gal; di-im-gu-ul “a pole”
Hungarian tenger “sea” Chagatai täŋiz Turkish deniz Sumerian diĝir (1837x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. diĝir; dim3-me-er; dim3-me8-er; dim3-mi-ir; di-me2-er “deity, god, goddess”. Since Turkish has also tanrı “god” and Mongolian tenger “god”, the semantic development is probably: “god” > “heaven” > “sea”, whereby the connection between “heaven” and “sea” is made by the common blue colour or by the fact that the heaven is mirrored in the sea.
Hungarian tenni, tesz, tev- “to do, to make, to place, to put” Proto-Altaic *t’ebV “to put” Proto-Mongolic *teγeProto-Tungusic *tebProto-Finno-Ugric *teke- “to do, to make” Sumerian tag (266x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, Middle Babylonian, unknown) wr. tag “to touch, take hold of; to bind; to attack”

Hungarian tor “feast (especially after a funeral and a pig-slaughtering [disznóölés])”

Hungarian Tóth (Magyar surname)
Sumerian utud (847x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tud; u3-tu; tu-ud “to give birth (to), bear a child”. According to EWU, p. 1535, < Old High German thiot “people” and after used as denonmination for Slavonic people, esp. Slowaks and Slovenians, but mostly in a negative sense, cf. tótosan beszélni “to speak with Slowakian accent”, tótágast állni “to be in a flap”, etc. However, it is hard to believe that a German word would have been used for the Slavonic foreigners in Hungary and especially a word with the general meaning “people”. Therefore, since Tóth originates in Sum. and considering the meaning “people”, which can only mean Hungarians, the Tóth’s must be one of the oldest Hung. tribes.

Proto-Finno-Ugric *tuδ’ka-mз(-) “sth. that protrudes; tip” Sumerian tuditum (48x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tu-di-da; urudtu3-di3-da; tu-ditumzabar; urudtu3-di-da; urudtu-di3-da “toggle pin” Akkadian tudittum. Considering the 3 consonant-root, here we have most probably an Akk.-Rhaet. loanword in Sumerian (which proves, in accordance with Lieberman 1977, p. 20 that Sumerian was still spoke in Old Babylonian time).
Hungarian tölgy “oak”
Sumerian tillug (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. til-lu-ug “elephant”. The semantic connection between “oak” and “elephant” is the hardness of the wood and the teeth, resp., similar to Engl. oak = Germ. Eiche, which are denominated after the word for “ice” (*ajeg-, Kluge 2002, p. 230; cf. Hung. jég).
Hungarian tömény “concentrated; numerous; crowded”, tömni “to cram, to fill, to stuff”

Hungarian tőr “dagge; rapier, foil” Proto-Finno-Ugric *terä “edge” Sumerian dur (9x: Old Babylonian) wr. dur10 “ax”, but cf. also ĝiri (198x: ED IIIb, Ebla, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. ĝiri2; urudĝiri2; me2-er; me-er; meri “razor; sword, dagger”
Hungarian tőr “snare, trap”

Hungarian törölni “to wipe, to dry (with a towel); to abolish, to annul”, törlő “handtowel”
Sumerian dirig (313x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. dirig "to drift (clouds); to float, glide (along/down); to go; to soak, steep, dissolve in liquid”, dirig (2x: Old Babylonian) wr. dirig “to become loose, fall out; to disintegrate; to disappear; to fall down, collapse”
Hungarian törvény “law”
Sumerian tar (237x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. tar; tarar “to cut down; to untie, loosen; to cut; to scatter, disperse; to decide”. Same etymology as törni.

Hungarian ugar “fallow (field/ground/land)
Sumerian agar (135x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. a-gar3; agar4; agar2; agar3; a-da-ar “meadow” Akkadian ugāru. Since Sum. shows traces of vowel harmony, Sum. agar < Akk., Rhaet. ugāru, so we have here another possible Akk. and Rhaet. borrowing in Sum. and thus another proof that Sum. was still spoken in Old Babylonian time (cf. Lieberman 1977, p. 20). The Akk. and Rhaet. word is also phonetically closer to the Hung. and may be the etymon for ugor “Ugric” > Germ. Ungar, Engl. Hungarian, French Hongrois, Russ. Vengerskiy, etc.
Hungarian ugrik “to jump, to leap, to spring”
Sumerian ug (1x: ED IIIa) wr. ugx(EZEN) “(to be) exalted”

Hungarian út “path, way”
Nenec ŋu’, ŋut “path, track, way” Selqup muõtt∂, wat “id.” Proto-Uralic *utka “path, track” Sumerian inti (10x: Old Babylonian) wr. in-ti; en-ti “way, path”. As it seems in this unique case, the Samoyed people have conserved the Sum. etymon phonetically much closer then the other Uralic languages, incl. Hung.
Hungarian utálni “to abhor, to detest, to hate” Proto-Ugric *aktз- “to vomit”
Sumerian ahan (2x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. a-ha-an “to vomit”, or ak (3643x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. ak; a “to do; to make; to act, perform”. Same etymology as okádni (s.v.).

Hungarian ürge “kind of squirrel that lives in the earth, Spermophilus citellus” Khakass örge, örke Sumerian irgilum (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. ir-gi-lum “locust”. Semantical connection between “squirrel” and “locust” probably via their common habit of eating (locust swarms were infamous). Alternatively to urgir (478x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. ur-gir15 “(domestic) dog”, which causes, however, also semantical problems.
Hungarian üröm “wormwood”
Sumerian hurium, wr. u2hu-ri2-um “a plant”
Hungarian ürü “lamb”
Altai irik “young ram” Kipchak örük “young castrated ram” Turkish irk “id.” Sumerian For Hung. one would prefer urri (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. ur2-ri-a “a designation of sheep”, but the other words seem to belong to kirga, wr. kir11ga “suckling lamb” with loss of the initial consonant. It may, however, also be that the final consonant dropped in Hung. and so all words belong to Sum. kirga.
Hungarian -üst: ez-üst “silver”, vas “iron”
Proto-Uralic *waśke “copper (?); some sort of metal or ore”
Sumerian uš, wr. uš15 “a copper vessel” Akkadian uššum

Hungarian ütni “to beat, to hit, to strike” Proto-Finno-Ugric *süttз- “to beat, to strike” Sumerian tu, wr. tu14 “to beat; to weave”, tud (4x: Old Babylonian) wr. tud2 “to hit, beat”. Probably with metathesis tu > *ut.

Hungarian (v)á/(v)é (translative suffix, e.g. vassá “[to transform sth.] into iron”; va/-ve, -ván/vén (supinum/gerund suffixes, e.g. adva, adván “giving”, léve, lévén “being”)
Proto-Uralic *-l (lative suffix), or *-ki (lative suffix) + *-j “id.”
Sumerian -e (directive, locative-terminative case marker), identical in sound and probably originating from the ergative particle –e (cf. Edzward 2003, p. 43)
Hungarian vad “wild; inhabited” Proto-Finno-Ugric *vamta Sumerian bad (3x: Old Babylonian) wr. bad4 “hard ground”. Engl. “bad”, according to traditional etymological dictionaries a “mystery word, no apparent relatives in other languages” is most probably besides Hung. vad the phonetically closest successor of Sum. bad.
Hungarian vágni “to chop, to cut, to hash; to slaughter; to throw” Proto-Finno-Ugric *waŋз
Sumerian pana (63x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. ĝešpana; ba-na; ĝešpanax(|ŠE.NUN&NUN|) “bow; a geometric figure”. In order to chop meat one still today best uses a bowshaped knife (Germ.: Wiege-messer, but “wiegen” = “weigh” has nothing to do with cutting; thus perhaps Wiege- < Hung. vág- < Sum. pan-?).
Hungarian vágyik “to desire, to long, to wish, to yearn, to crave” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wačз- “to chase, to drive, to hunt”
ed (595x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. ed3; |UD×U+U+U.DU| “to go up or down, to ascend”. Same etymology as űzni.
Hungarian vaj “butter” Proto-Altaic *majV “fat” Proto-Turkic *bań Proto-Mongolic *majProto-Tungusic *majProto-Finno-Ugric *woje “fat, grease” Mari ü, üj “butter, oil” Mordvin oj, vaj “butter, margarine; fat” Sumerian i (8654x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. i3; u5; u2 “oil; butter”. The Sum. apophony is mirrored in the FU reflexes. As the Sum. and the Mari words show, diphthongization happened only in the single languages.
Hungarian vájni “to hollow, to dig out” Sumerian u, wr. u “hole”
Hungarian vajúdik “to eke out a bare existence” Proto-Finno-Ugric *woje- “to be able to” Sumerian u (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. u8; u2 “defeat”

Given the Sum. etymology there is thus no reason to believe (EWU, p. 1606) that the Hung. word are borrowing from an Iranian language.

Hungarian veréb “sparrow”
Sumerian buru (30x: ED IIIa, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. buru5mušen “bird(s), small birds, sparrow; flock of birds”. Engl. sparrow, Germ. Sper-ling < ProtoGermanic *sparwan < PIE *sper-, but since this may be one of the several cases with prosthetic s-, PIE *(s)per- probably < Sum. buru.
Hungarian verem “cave, den, hole, pit”
Sumerian bur (85x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. bur; na4bur “bowl”, burud (49x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. burudx(U) “breach, hole; depression, low-lying area, depth; to perforate; (to be) deep”
Hungarian vért “armour, cuirass”
Sumerian gur (35x: Old Babylonian) wr. gur21; kušburu4mušen; eur2 “shield”
Hungarian vese “kidney” Proto-Ugric *w8ćз “penis” Sumerian ĝeš (47x: Old Babylonian) wr. ĝeš3; mu “penis; male” Akkadian išaru. Since the Akk. and Rhaet. word are borrowings form the Sum. word, Akk. Rhaet. išaru < *viśaru (still conserved in the name of the Akk.-Rhaet. death-ghost Rhaet. Vitammu, Akk. Itammu, Etemmu, cf. Brunner and Tóth 1987, p. 61) with initial v- still conserved in Hung. vese. Therefore, the Hung. cannot originate directly in the Sum., but in the Akk., Rhaet. word.
Hungarian vésni “to chisel, to cut” Proto-Finn-Ugric *wäńgćз(-) “to cut; knife” Sumerian peš, wr. peš6 “to slice” Akkadian paşādu
Hungarian vészni “to get lost”, veszteni “to lose”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *wočз- “to be lost”, *wäsз- “to disappear, to get lost” Sumerian uš (3556x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian) wr. uš2 “to die; to be dead; to kill; death”
Hungarian vessző “rod, twig, verge”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *waćз “narrow, thin bent branch” Sumerian ĝeš (5552x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. ĝeš; mu; u5 “tree; wood” Akkadian işu < *wişu (cf. s.v. vese)
Hungarian vetni “to cast, to fling, to throw; to drill, to sow” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wettä- “to throw”

Hungarian vézna “thin, slight” Proto-Finno-Volgaic *wäćkз “narrow, thin” Proto-Ugric *wäńćз, *wäćз “narrow, thin” Sumerian sig (343x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian, 1st millennium) wr. sig “(to be) weak; (to be) low; (to be) thin; (to be) narrow”, gig (313x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. gig “to be) sick”
Hungarian vigyázni “to pay attention, to beware, to look out” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wića- “to notice, to see” Sumerian igi sig (8x: Old Babylonian) wr. igi sig10 “to see”
Hungarian világ “light; world”, villám “lightening”, villanni “to flash, to sparkle, to twinkle”, villogni “to sparkle, to twinkle”,
Proto-Finno-Ugric *walkз(-) “light, white; to light”, *wal’з- “to shine” Sumerian bil (50x: Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. bil2; bil3; bil “to burn”
Hungarian virág “flower”, virítani “to bloom”, virradni “to dawn”, virrasztani “to stay awake”
Sumerian bur (78x: ED IIIa, Old Akkadian, Ur III) wr. bur2; bu7 “light; to glow, shine”. According to EWU (pp. 1640ss.), the word-families vir- and vil- (cf. világ) belong together (but not the family virr-). The Sum. word bur, however, shows that this is not correct, the dark stem vowel u is even apparent in the ending ani instead of –eni in virítani as well as in virradni instead of *virredni. Akkadian arāqum “to bloom” < *warāqum, but unlike in the case of Hung. vese (s.v.), *w- < b-, not < g-.
Hungarian vinni, visz- “to carry, to bring, to take” Proto-Finno-Ugric *wiγeSumerian gaĝ (538x: Ur III) wr. gaĝx(IL2); ga-aĝ3 “to carry”. Same etymology as venni (s.v.).
Hungarian vívni “to fight”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *woje- “to be able to” Sumerian u (1x: Old Babylonian) wr. u8; u2 “defeat”
Hungarian víz “water” Proto-Uralic *wete Sumerian biz (12x: Old Babylonian) wr. bi-iz; biz “to trickle, drip” Akkadian başāşum (< Sum. biz). In this case, we can say from the palatal stem vowel both in Hung. víz (acc. vizet, not *vizot or *vizat) and Sum. biz that this word originates directly in Sum. and not in the Sum. borrowing Akk., Rhaet. başāşum, which shows a velar stem-vowel. Also PIE *wodor/*wedor/ *uder-, from root *wed- (cf. Hittite watar, Sanskrit udnah, Greek hydor, Old Bulgarian, Russian voda, Lithuanian vanduo, Old Prussian. wundan, Gaelic uisge “water”, Latin unda “wave” originate in Sum. biz and thus also genetically related to Hung. víz.

Hungarian vő, vej- “son-in-law”
Proto-Uralic *wäŋз “bridegroom, stepson” Sumerian pap (86x: Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. pap “father; male, virile; brother” Akkadian abu “father”. Hung. vő comes not directly from Sum. pap, but from the Sum. borrowing in Akk., Rhaet. abu, the meaning of which is, however, “father” and not “son-in-law”. The reason may be, that a related word, Sum. abba > Hung. apa “father”, so Sum. abu got its special meaning of a more distant male relative.
Hungarian vöcsök “crested grebe (a kind of duck, family of Podicipedidae)”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *wajćз “a kind of duck”
Sumerian uz (57x: ED IIIa, ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. uz; uzmušen “wild duck” Akkadian ūsu

Proto-Uralic *waδ’kз “small river; bend or stretch of a river between two curves”
Turkish vadi “valley” Sumerian id (1086x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. id2; id3; id6; id7; id5 “river, watercourse, canal”
Hungarian -z (denominative verb suffix, e.g. neve-z- “to name, to call”, név, neve“name”)
Proto-Uralic *-t (denominative verb suffix) Sumerian -za (denominative verb particle, e.g. pudpad “sound, noise”, pudpad za “to make noise”
Hungarian zaj “noise”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *śoje(-) “audible sound; to make noise, to sound” Proto-Ugric *soj8(-) “id.” Sumerian šeg (28x: Old Babylonian) wr. še; šeg10; šegx(|KA×KID2|); šegx(|KA×LI|); šed15; šeg12 “voice, cry, noise”
Hungarian zajlik “to drift (of ice)”
Proto-Finno-Ugric *ćaka “drifting ice; thin ice” Sumerian šeg (11x: ED IIIb, Lagash II, Ur III, Old Babylonian) wr. šeg9; šeg4 “snow; sleet; cold weather; frost, ice”
